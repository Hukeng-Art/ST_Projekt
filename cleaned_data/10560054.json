    "text": "\nThe tauntauns know that there is something wrong with Hoth. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nThey shift and stamp and bray alarm at all hours of the day and night. The stables reek of dung and terror, hot and thick and sour, and Han knows this firsthand, because the Princess\u2019s version of flirting is to order him to go and muck them out as part of her ongoing campaign to ignore the fact that she is clearly, clearly in love with him. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cHave you ever considered that you are her bitch?\u201d smirks Chewie, leaning up against the wall like a moth eaten hunk of rug. Wookies are amazingly good at smirking, despite the abundance of facial hair: they somehow do it with their whole body, shoulders and teeth and long arms all combining to form the perfect picture of absolute amused disdain. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cHave you ever considered,\u201d retorts Han, \u201cthat you\u2019re a dick? The Princess loves me and just can\u2019t admit it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd you don\u2019t love her?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s...pretty,\u201d says Han, \u201cbut I\u2019m Han Solo. I\u2019m not in love with her.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re shovelling shit because she asked you to.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m -- shut up, I\u2019m helping with the Rebellion.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cRemember when you flew away from the Rebellion because you\u2019re a strong independent smuggler -- \u201c\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201c--shut up --\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201c--who don\u2019t need no Princess?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, fuck off.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first time Han met Luke, he had to look twice. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nAsk him why. He\u2019ll say something like, \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe that some scruffy hick was wandering around the Cantina looking like a good time\u2026\u201d Give him a drink. Ask him why. He\u2019ll say, \u201cWell, he had an \n\namazing\n\n arse.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nBut get him good and properly drunk, pop him in a corner of Hoth -- miles and miles from home, where everything is dark and lonely and strange -- and sit down next to him and \n\nask\n\n. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nWhy did you look twice at Luke -\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nHan will wipe his mouth, fretful. He\u2019ll blink. He\u2019ll look left, then right, then lower his voice.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cBecause he was shining. Because, for a moment -- just for a moment -- I swore he had \n\nwings\n\n.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nHe\u2019ll pause. Inhale shakily. And then he\u2019ll say, \u201cAnd teeth. Sharp, blood-dripping teeth.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s...something,\u201d says Kaali, thin and careful, treading around what she really wants to say which is this: there is something wrong with the Princess. There is something wrong with her eyes --\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nKaali\u2019s new to the Rebellion; it has taken her months to find her way to Hoth, following trails of misinformation, leaping from informant to informant, navigating the layers of secrecy that shield the rebel base. She arrived to this monochrome world -- with the iron sky and white-as-death ground -- with nothing more than a heart full of hope and a blaster that doesn\u2019t work.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nThey take her in. They are teaching her to fly. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s awesome,\u201d coos Wedge, staring dreamily into the distance. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nTrue: she inspires awe.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s the awe that Kaali feels for a blizzard though, or a raging forest fire: you stare at it, admire the gorgeous destructive power of nature, and then you run, you run for your life, you run until your feet give out from under you -- \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe Princess greeted her when she stumbled off her stolen ship. Kaali, drenched in travel-sweat and shivering, had met her eyes -- her huge, dark eyes, spangling with stars and the light from distant parts of space where no life has ever been, an abyssal void, a shrill dark \n\naching\n\n emptiness --\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nKaali froze, her tentacles coiling back in fear, her hearts stammering against her ribs. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPredator\n\n, roars her blood, \n\npredator, predator run run run -- \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cGood to meet you,\u201d said the monster, the Princess, the thing with eyes like handfuls of empty space suspended in the air, black and quivering holes in reality. And, as Kaali stared, the monster\u2019s skin started to change: glowing white reaching out for every corner of the room, tendrils that became wings, became talons, became teeth. No fixed shape, no \n\noutline\n\n to that body; a blur of white that transcended space and time. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nKaali did the only sensible thing one can do in a situation like that: she fainted.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nAnd here she is, six months later, cursing her Force-sensitivity. She has -- finally -- stopped getting nosebleeds when she hears the Princess\u2019s voice.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nBaby steps.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d says Kaali. She gathers her courage into a bundle in her arms, thrusts it all forwards. \u201cBut -- there\u2019s something strange about her. Do you know what I mean? There\u2019s something \n\nstrange\n\n about her.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nWedge hesitates. They\u2019re perched on a set of crates to the side of the hangar, sharing a break and a cup of caf. Around them, the Rebellion hums and sings with activity, buzzing with laughter. Somewhere Kaali read that the only revolution worth having is one where there is dancing, and that is certainly true here. Yes, there is struggle and pain and bloodshed -- but there is joy as well. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he says, eventually. \u201cShe...shines. Sometimes -- sometimes, it hurts to look at her. But in a good way. If that makes sense.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt does. Kaali sips her caf -- bitter, because sugar is rationed down to the quick -- and thinks of joy, and fear, and monsters who bring hope to pilots. And she thinks of the blizzards on Hoth, how hard they are to navigate, but how they shield the Rebellion, this warm heart of ferocious struggle nurtured and sheltered by a Death Planet. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nShe shines. And it hurts to look at her. But that makes sense.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n--\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nHan dreams that he is walking through the tauntaun stables -- only there are no tauntauns, just dusty straw silvered by the moonlight, because in his dream the stables are half-demolished, the roof gaping open to the stars. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nIt is silent, apart from a sort of wet, crunching noise. Every fibre of his being tells him to \n\nstay away\n\n from that sound; but this is a dream, and in the manner of dreams he cannot control his body; and so he walks on, turning corner after corner \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n(\n\nthe stables aren\u2019t this big this is a bloody labyrinth -- )\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nuntil he turns into one of the stalls and there is the slack body of a tauntaun, split open crotch to throat, and buried half inside it is a monster with bright white wings and a mouth on the back of its head, a mouth gaping so wide that you could stride right into it, complete with rank upon rank of bloodied teeth. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nThen it turns -- and as it turns it changes, its glistening silver-white skin contracting, its wings dissolving into glitter, and transforms into Luke. Big-eyed, golden-haired, smiling -- and red-mouthed, and red-handed, and chewing on tauntaun guts. His teeth flash scarlet and sharp. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cHi Han,\u201d he chirrups. \u201cYou okay?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cUh,\u201d says Han, because even in dreams there isn\u2019t much to say to such an image. Luke slurps a dripping hunk of...something off his finger and grins even wider. Too wide. His cheeks split right open, almost to his ears.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cHungry?\u201d says Luke, offering him a fistful of red meat.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t you going to cook it first?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cNah. I like tasting the life in it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nHis teeth are red, his eyes white and bright and they aren\u2019t eyes, not at all, they are the moon, hungry and huge, they are the sun, hot enough to turn all life to ash and that is all there is, teeth and eyes and \n\nhunger\u00a0\n\n-- hunger enough to swallow the universe. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n(\n\nhe\u2019ll eat the galaxy up in bites and grin while he does and -- )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next day, Han sneaks up behind Luke in the canteen and smacks him around the back of the head.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nHe turns around, scruffy and shocked, and every inch human.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nReassured, Han slumps down beside him. \u201cFarmboy, you look like shit.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a dick.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nHan\u2019s mother, before she died (and when she was around), would tell him how we only see one world. There are others, she would insist, layered on top of each other, like a collage. And those with the Force can peer through the skin of this world into others -- into the past, into the future, thousands of miles away, or into another realm where there are no laws of nature, where strange and dark things roam. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nHe never really believed her. But now he lets his gaze slip off Luke and he tries to look \n\nbeyond\n\n and \n\nthrough\n\n and his eyes start to water and --\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nA wing? A tooth? Yes: glossy tentacles and -- \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cHan? \n\nHan?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nLuke waves his hand in front of Han\u2019s eyes. Han, for a moment, doesn\u2019t see a hand but a talon covered in dense white feathers which quickly becomes an ivory hissing snake and then a hand again. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nA headache starts to build behind his temples, dull and pounding. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cSorry, kid. Not quite awake yet.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rebels didn\u2019t like Luke when they first met him. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nNone of them can quite describe it, but there is something \n\noff \n\nabout him; not \n\noff\n\n in the same way that Leia is because Leia is their commander and her \n\noffness \n\nis their \n\noffness\n\n, and she belongs to them, and they belong to her, and that is the way of things. Before battle, when she addresses her troops, for a moment, she is not a tiny almost-woman not-quite-girl but a towering white and gold wonder: like an ancient goddess of battle, spreading her wings wide, protecting all who would shelter at her feet. She\u2019s a she-wolf, a krayt dragon, everything sharp-toothed and ferocious, and she would kill and die for her pilots, and in that moment her white-gold wings touch them all, lie over their heads and hearts, whispers \n\nbe brave be bold be true I will not abandon you\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe is a monster, but one you want on your side. One you have on your side. She is fury and the warm embrace of a mother and the cleansing scour of the sun. Look on her, ye unworthy, and fucking \n\ntremble\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd then Luke, big-eyed farmboy, swans in, babbling about womp rats, and there is something \n\noff \n\nabout him as well. They call it arrogance, blame the Jedi, say that it must be a Tatooine thing.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut they avoid him. Because every now and then they see something, and they can\u2019t explain it, and he isn\u2019t their general, and his \n\noffness\n\n isn\u2019t something that they can qualify or understand.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\ndo you trust him\n\n they ask Leia.\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe says \n\nhe\u2019s a scoundrel but \u2013\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nno, not Han Solo, why do you think \n\n\neverything \n\n\nis about him \u2013 ok, ok, we mean Luke \u2013\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLuke? I think he can do this. Yes: I trust him\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe brings the Death Star down, and tumbles out of the cockpit, and for one moment he isn\u2019t human; he\u2019s a star, he\u2019s shining, he\u2019s a wonder. And the pilots cheer and chant his name, because he is their Skywalker, and his strangeness is part of the Rebel Alliance now. \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n--\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Chewie says.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cCounting the tautauns.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cMaking sure they\u2019re all there.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201c\n\nWhy\n\n?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cI had a dream.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey, Princess -- do you think it\u2019s time you kissed me?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nHan Solo is one decadent slur against the wall. Leia tips her nose up, slants him what \n\nshe \n\nthinks is a look of pure dignity. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n(Kaali walks between them. Neither notice. The rebels are so used to this kind of nonsense that they just walk in and out of the arguments.)\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cDepends nerfherder -- has Hoth defrosted?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cHave you?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nLeia rolls her eyes. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cHas anyone ever told you that you\u2019ve got eyes like the night sky?\u201d Han says, tipping his head on one side. \u201cYou look like you\u2019ve got all the stars in all the universes in there.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cHuh,\u201d says Leia. \u201cYou\u2019re a poet.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cYup,\u201d says Han -- though he doesn\u2019t see it as poetry. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s true. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nHer eyes are dark and you could drown in them, let go of everything and soar off into the night. Han looks Leia in the yes and she looks back at him and the air around them takes on a strange static charge, and Han feels the brush of \n\nsomething\n\n -- a tendril, or a wing -- on his shoulder, curving to his back, caressing him, pulling him closer. \n\nCloser\n\n -- \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nInto the dreaming dark, into the starlight, the fall of silver and midnight, the unimaginable cavern of her gaze. It\u2019s monstrous. It\u2019s wonderful. Leia\u2019s skin is lightning-white and glowing, and she has more teeth than most girls do, and yes most people Han has been with do not literally \n\nshine\n\n but he wants her so much he could die from it.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nHan\u2019s in love with flight. He\u2019s in love with freedom. Of course Leia -- Leia who is strange, and wonderful, and not-entirely-human -- is his dream woman. Person. Thing? \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nShe makes him believe in the Force. She makes him believe in hope. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nHe loves her not \n\nin spite\n\n of her bizarre nature but \n\nbecause \n\nof it, \n\nbecause\n\n of it -- \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nAn alarm starts to shrill. The gentle brush of an invisible limb vanishes and there\u2019s a patrol missing, there\u2019s work to be done, and Leia spins on her heel and runs towards the bugle. In her wake is a shadow with vast, shaking wings. \n\n\nAnakin and Padme have been sleeping together for a little under three months when he asks to blindfold her. She pretends coyness: lashes dipping down, smiling up at him, fussing with the front of his robes. \u201cOh, my noble paramour,\u201d she coos. \u201cWhy would you want to do such a naughty thing?\u201d \n\n\nAnakin\u2019s cheeks go bright pink. \u201cWell, we don\u2019t have to, I just thought \u2013 I mean it was just \u2013 sorry if I offended you \u2013\u201d\n\n\nHe\u2019s so easy to fluster, this Jedi of hers. He makes a pretence of being brash and tough and powerful, but he comes undone at her touch (quite literally: their first encounters are marked by their brevity more than anything else) and she loves to see him blush and stammer. \n\n\n\u201cMy darling,\u201d she purrs, pressing herself closer to him. \u201cI would \n\nadore\n\n that.\u201d\n\n\nAnd later, in her quarters, Anakin knots a silk scarf around her eyes. He kisses her neck and she shudders with pleasure. His hands are hot as firebrands, sliding under the layers of her dress. It\u2019s like he carries a little of the desert inside him. \n\n\n\u201cWill you, um. Can I take your dress off?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d she says, and he fumbles with the catch at the nape of her neck. It\u2019s a complicated one. She could assist him. She doesn\u2019t; instead she giggles, wiggles her arse against his crotch; giggles more when his breath hitches. \n\n\nHe finally succeeds in undoing the catch, but doesn\u2019t pull her dress down. Instead he says, \u201cWhat did you see when you first met me?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI \u2013 what an odd question.\u201d Anakin\u2019s twenty. He\u2019s not really given to deeper conversation when she is squirming and eager for him. But she replies anyway: \u201cI saw a boy brimful of potential.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo. More than that. Was there \u2013 was there anything strange about me?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnakin, what\u2019s wrong \u2013\u201d she makes to take the blindfold off, to turn around; but he catches her wrists (releasing her dress in the process) and pulls her hands back down to her hips, pressing his forehead into the nest of her hair. \n\n\n\u201cNothing. I\u2019m just \u2013 I just want to know.\u201d\n\n\nShe settles herself back against him. \u201cI saw a boy bright-burning,\u201d she says. And then, shocked into honesty: \u201cI sometimes\u2026there were moments when there was something odd about you. Like\u2026like your eyes were full of fire, or you had \n\nwings \n\n\u2013 but it must have been a trick of the light.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d says Anakin. \u201cYes. And that was before my training. Before Obi Wan taught me that\u2026that control is needed, sometimes. I didn\u2019t know how to \u2013 how to \u2013\u201d\n\n\n(\n\nhide\n\n)\n\n\nThe word snaps into her head. But that wasn\u2019t what he was going to say. Was it? No: it is just her brain filling in gaps. \n\n\nThe blindfold rests across the bridge of her nose. For a moment, she wants to rip it away; but then Anakin releases her hands, turns her back to face him. His lips find hers, briefly. He smiles. \n\n\n(\n\nhide\n\n)\n\n\nIt\u2019s just her brain. Silly random words popping up. It happens to everyone. \n\n\nThey make love. And when Anakin comes, he presses his face into the curve of her neck. She doesn\u2019t see his face.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n--\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nVader is blind.\n\n\nSometimes, he remembers a time when he was larger than the skin he wore. But those times are few and far between, and he crushes them down. \n\n\nHe is an instrument of the Emperor\u2019s Will. Nothing less. \n\n\nAnd, certainly, nothing more. \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n--\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a monster,\u201d says Anakin, his voice stretched thin. His hands shake around his mug of hot chocolate. One day, his son will love the same drink with the same egregious intensity. Anakin will never know this. He will never know his son. Not really. \n\n\n\u201cYou are a monster,\u201d says Senator Palpatine. \u201cBut do not be ashamed of that. You are magnificent. You are more than the Jedi wish to make you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n--\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAgain?\u201d says Mace Windu. \u201c\n\nAgain\n\n. Skywalker, you can\u2019t -- did Obi Wan not teach you control?\u201d\n\n\nAnakin\u2019s hands flex in on themselves. He breathes slowly and deeply.\n\n\nHe\u2019s twenty one. He\u2019s a general. And yet he is chastised because he permits his extra limbs to show, because he sometimes forgets to speak with only one mouth -- instead he speaks with fifteen throats at the same time, his voice layered and quivering and \n\nbuzzing. \n\n\n\n\u201cThis is why you cannot teach the younglings,\u201d says Mace. Anakin feels a sharp stab of shame, neat as a needle under his heart. The image\n\n\n(\n\nhe hadn\u2019t meant to shout he\u2019d been angry he hadn\u2019t known there was a youngling walking past his quarters he didn\u2019t know that if they hadn\u2019t learned to shield their Force senses -- )\n\n\n\n\n(she was okay. She was bleeding from the eyes and ears and nose but she was okay, she was breathing, she could see, still.)\n\n\n\n\n(but next time?)\n\n\n\nflickers once more into his head, and he lowers his eyes. \n\n\n\u201cIf you gave me a chance,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d blind them,\u201d says Mace, flatly, \u201cI can barely stand to look at you. How would it be when a child tries to look at you in your true form --\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThis is my true form!\u201d Anakin barks. His throat buzzes. The lights dim. He feels wings unfurl from flanks that extend into dimensions that no human can perceive without madness and Mace Windu unsheathes his lightsabre --\n\n\nAnakin fights, chokes on the coppery rush of his own blood, and withdraws. His eyes boil red with tears. \u201cThis is my true form,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m human. I\u2019m \n\nhuman\n\n.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n--\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not,\u201d says Sheev Palpatine. \u201cYou\u2019re so much \n\nmore\n\n.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n--\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nThis is what it is to be Anakin Skywalker: the Jedi call you a monster. They don\u2019t let you have an apprentice. You hear the thoughts of the council, how they worry that you would cannibalise any padawan under your care. Only, only, it wouldn\u2019t be cannibalism would it \u2013 because you\u2019re not human, not really.\n\n\nThis is what it is to be Anakin Skywalker. Padme makes you feel human. She also makes you feel less human than ever. He swallows down the Force side of him when he is with her, locks it tight inside him, behind his ribcage, feels it simmer vinegary and bitter. Sex with Padme is an ordeal, sometimes. Above her, inside her, and it is all he can do to stop himself unfurling ten sets of wings, all molten gold and running with inky ichor that could be blood, or could be liquid night. No human could say. \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n--\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nAll that power.\n\n\nAll that \n\nstrength\n\n. \n\n\nBut all the power in the world means nothing when its wielder is frightened, and alone. In another world, an entirely-human Anakin is manipulated through his love for his wife, his desperation to belong. In this one, exactly the same thing happens. Anakin is caught in the sharp cracks of: \n\nI want to be human \n\nand \n\nI am not human \n\nand \n\nI am not a monster \n\nand \n\nthey tell me I am \n\nand \n\nI want to do the right thing \n\nand \n\nI do not know what the right thing is\n\n, and fear leads to hate, and hate leads to the Dark Side where all things drown, and even the son of the Force cannot escape the tides pulling him in, deeper and deeper, until the Light is a dim and distant quiver. \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n--\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nHe kills the younglings with a thought. Their blood splashes high on the walls and his mouths open up to drink it. \n\n\nHe is hideous. He is glorious. His heart beats with the enormity of empire and Sheev Palpatine still holds his lead.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n--\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nMustafar. \n\n\nThe molten planet, the blistering lava, the dead and empty sky. Padme lying where Anakin threw her. Anakin himself breaking apart at the seams: his eyes huge and black, too many teeth in his gums, his tongue splitting in twain, becoming a twisting pair of snakes \u2013 and Obi Wan closes his eyes, he has to. The images are too awful. The Dark Side, where all things drown. Even the brightest son of the Force. \n\nOh how thou art fallen \u2013 \n\n\n\n\u201cMaster! Master! Won\u2019t you look at me?\u201d\n\n\nAnd Obi Wan \n\ndoes\n\n, but he doesn\u2019t open his eyes: he opens himself to the Force, and feels it pour into him in a hot red tide, snarling and sparking with Anakin\u2019s frenzy. He sees Anakin in his entirety for the first and only time: both human and Force, monster and wonder, mortal and god, wound together, ever-shifting. How can you fight something like that? How? Obi Wan illuminates his lightsabre. Anakin snarls with a thousand tongues, and starts forwards, and it seems that all of reality is surging towards Obi-Wan, breaking at the edges and \u2013\n\n\n\nI am one with the Force, and the Force is in me\n\n, Obi Wan thinks: the old Jedi meditation, and Anakin is bigger than any moon, anything, he is in the physical realm and the mental one at the same time, he is an impossibility he is \u2013 \n\n\n\nI AM ONE WITH THE FORCE AND THE FORCE IS IN ME \n\nand Obi Wan \n\nopens his eyes\n\n and his apprentice is there, sort of human-shaped, but only in the vaguest possible way. Like a blurry holovid, or one of those optical illusions so popular among younglings; you look at it this way and it is a droid, that way and it is a star. Obi Wan keeps his eyes open, and his Force-sensitivity open, and Anakin flickers in and out of existence, sometimes there and sometimes not, and reality itself shrieks. But the Force is everything and everywhere, and Obi Wan draws on it; because power is what you make if it, \n\nlife\n\n is what you make of it, and there is always a choice. \n\n\nObi Wan makes his.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n--\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a lightsabre made of?\u201d says a golden-haired child, fresh from the desert. \n\n\nObi Wan unsheathes his, spins it in a circlet of glowing blue. Anakin coos in delight. He\u2019s still young enough to be awed by his Master.\n\n\n\u201cIt gets its power from a kyber crystal -- it vibrates, and creates a constantly moving stream of energy. See? They\u2019re unique. There\u2019s an old legend that they exist in every realm at the same time. You see, there\u2019s this theory that there are multiple worlds all linked by the Force -- \u201d\n\n\n\u201cHuh.\u201d Unimpressed by this foray into theology, Anakin directs the conversation to more interesting ground. \u201cAnd they can cut through anything?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYup. \n\nAnything\n\n.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n--\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nThe battle jumps between realms, between times, in and out of the physical landscape, and there are times when Obi Wan doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019s fighting on the planet Mustafar or in the heat and tempest of Anakin\u2019s mind. He ignores everything around him and focuses on the beat of his heart, the strength of his lightsabre, his padawan. And \u2013\n\n\n\nYou can\u2019t win Master!I have the high ground! \n\nAnd are they in Anakin\u2019s fevered dreamscape? Are they on the lava-carved banks of a dead planet? Are those Anakin\u2019s eyes, or are they stars, bright-burning and so very close?\n\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter. Obi Wan makes his choice. His lightsabre can cut through anything. Anakin falls in two smoking halves, and the lava takes him. The air around him catches fire, and for a moment Obi Wan sees tentacles, wings, teeth: all burning. \n\n\n\u201cYou were meant to be the Chosen One,\u201d says Obi Wan. \n\n\nAnd he turns his back, and leaves the wonderterror son of the Force to the fire. \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n--\n\n\u00a0\n\nBreha and Bail Organa have spines of purest kyber. They have to. Raising a baby is hard enough -- raising a baby who occasionally forgets that she is meant to look like a baby and becomes a twisting white-gold mess of light and insanity, a vortex of unholy chaos and dread that causes mortal eyes to stream blood, isn\u2019t exactly in the parenting handbook. \n\n\nBut they manage. When she changes form, they hold her. They sing their love to her. And Leia learns what humanity is, and she learns how to keep her other form -- not her true form, for her human form is the form she chose for herself and thus is the truest form she could have -- secret. \n\n\nWhat better skill is there for a politician than the ability to hide one\u2019s secrets?\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n--\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nVader is blind.\n\n\nVader is a husk of a man. Powerful, yes, but nothing \u2013 nothing! \u2013 compared to Anakin. \n\n\n(Sometimes he remembers the taste of the stars -- but now he is trapped and sealed in a metal prison, and he will never see them again.)\n\n\n(This is what Palpatine tells him, so it must be true.)\n\n\nHere is a girl, dressed in lethal white. \n\n\nShe stands in front of him and lies. She stands in front of him and sneers.\n\n\nShe is ferocious and young, and he wants very much to see what her spine looks like. It would be white and red and glistening. (Vader hates all things. He does. He \n\ndoes\n\n. And if he tells himself that enough, he will believe it.), \n\n\nHere is a girl, almost entirely human, full to the brim with love and hope. She stands before Vader and lies, and her wings shine with the power of ten thousand suns. \n\n\nVader doesn\u2019t see them. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuke is six months old, and has just started to sleep through the night, when Jabba\u2019s men come for the quarter-tax.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOwen is expecting them. He stands on his porch, besides the standard three barrels of water, and he breathes. In out. In out. The stars glare down, and the three moons form a malicious, staring triumvirate. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThere are gods on Tattooine, but they aren\u2019t kind ones. \n\n\u00a0\n\nOut from the shadows come the men, and Owen doesn\u2019t recognise them. That thought alone sends a crawl of fear down his spine. \n\n\u00a0\n\n(Beru is in Luke\u2019s room, blaster on her knee, eyes bright and ears pricked.)\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere are two. The larger is a great hulking mess of man and cyborg, his right arm replaced by a vast rusted claw. Cords of muscle bulge and pulse along his bare chest and shoulders, the noxious purple-red of bio-implants bought from the black market. His thighs, likewise, are larger than they have any right to be, supported by quivering metal shins.\n\n\u00a0\n\n(Beru is in Luke\u2019s room. She has a blaster -- )\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe smaller is female, red-haired, with a modified Tusken raider mask serving as a prosthetic lower jaw; it extends under her hair, to her ears, and leaks poisonous-looking black oil. Her eyes are yellow and manic.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOwen,\u201d she drawls. Her voice is distorted by the mask. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cJabba\u2019s tribute.\u201d Owen\u2019s got his own blaster on his hip, but they all know he won\u2019t use it. He can\u2019t. If he kills them, the galaxy isn\u2019t large enough to shield him and his tiny family. Jabba will find them. And he will flay Luke first, and then Beru, and he will make Owen watch, and Owen knows this, because he has seen it happen. \n\n\u00a0\n\n(Beru is in Luke\u2019s room. She has a blaster. If she hears shots -- )\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t look like much to me. It look like much to you, Sartra?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t look like much to me Laylee,\u201d says the man. His voice scrapes low, guttural and thick. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt was what Jaytra asked for --\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear? Jaytra\u2019s dead. Dumb cunt was skimming water for himself. Jabba fed him to the Sarlacc. You know it takes ten thousand years to digest you? Last thing to go is your face.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt \n\nlikes babies\n\n,\u201d coos Sartra, and sniggers, and --\n\n\u00a0\n\n(Beru is in Luke\u2019s room and she has a blaster and it is \n\nnot to use on the henchmen --)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d says Owen.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d says Laylee, \u201cwe\u2019ve been hearing rumours. Apparently there\u2019s an old man in the caves, protecting your farm from raiders.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nBen. Force curse him. He doesn\u2019t know Tattooine, he doesn\u2019t know the cruel gods of the desert, he doesn\u2019t know -- \n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s too late. \n\n\u00a0\n\n(Beru has a blaster -- )\n\n\u00a0\n\n(Beru has a blaster and right now it will be pointing --)\n\n\u00a0\n\nOwen crushes his thoughts down, clenching his jaw until his teeth ache. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHave you,\u201d he says, \u201cI haven\u2019t seen any old man.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cLiar,\u201d growls Sartra, and Laylee laughs, an awful sound completely divorced from delight. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThen she hits him. \n\n\u00a0\n\nOwen stumbles back, blood welling in his mouth. He reaches for his blaster --\n\n\u00a0\n\n(--Beru has a blaster and right now --)\n\n\u00a0\n\n( -- the Sarlacc likes babies --)\n\n\u00a0\n\n(--ten thousand years--)\n\n\u00a0\n\n(--\n\npointing at the cradle the blaster is trained on the cradle --)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n-- and stops, his fingers flexing. Hopeless tears boil behind his eyes. \u201cPlease,\u201d he says. \u201cPlease, take whatever you -- \u201c\n\n\u00a0\n\nLaylee grabs him by the front , hauls him aloft. His legs dangle. Sartra kicks the barrels over and precious water gurgles along the red sands. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna take your wife first, and -- \u201c starts Laylee. \n\n\u00a0\n\nShe doesn\u2019t get any further. \n\n\u00a0\n\nOwen is aware, first, of a tremendous heat on his back; a searing, scalping heat. \n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd then Laylee screams: a high, rasping metallic ululation. Her eyes bubble and boil and drip down her cheeks. \n\n\u00a0\n\nShe drops him. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(there was a blaster --)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd Owen rolls over, looks behind him, and there stands Beru, baby Luke shining in her arms. \n\nShining\n\n. His skin roils and dances into wings, stars, teeth. He\u2019s the most beautiful thing Owen has ever seen.\n\n\u00a0\n\n(\n\nCLOSE YOUR EYES)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nOwen covers his eyes with his hands, presses his face into the sand. \n\n\u00a0\n\nIn the morning, they bury the bodies. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe next day Owen hikes out to where Ben Kenobi made his home. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe tells him to stay away. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cLuke isn\u2019t a normal child,\u201d insists Ben. \u201cHe needs to be watched, he needs guidance -- \u201c\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe isn\u2019t a normal child. But I don\u2019t see how your guidance helped my brother,\u201d snaps Owen. It is cruel, but so is the desert. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe does not see Ben Kenobi again. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n--\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPretending to be more dangerous than you actually are is an essential skill in Tattooine -- so it feels anathema to Beru to take her sunshiny nephew and tell him to make himself appear vulnerable, to tamp down his extra limbs under his skin. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNot all the time,\u201d she hastens to add, \u201cbut around people in the town, and around Jabba\u2019s gang -- but when you\u2019re out, when you\u2019re hunting, then you can...let yourself go a bit.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s the difference between Luke and Leia. A politician is always watched. A farmboy is not. A politician's main skill must be deception. A farmboy must be able to defend his homestead. And, yes, sometimes this farmboy will go after womp with his bare teeth and hands and stagger back, blood-drunk and grinning, his face painted scarlet and his hair spiked on end with sweat, depositing a carcass for dinner straight onto the table (a carcass that has clearly had bites taken out of it) before curling up in a spot of sun like a cat, and dozing off his meal. And, yes, this farmboy takes his A-17 and pours his soul into it -- quite literally, for in certain lights the A-17 wavers, and you swear it has wings. \n\n\u00a0\n\nOwen knows that the boy\u2019s father is hunting him. Owen remembers his one and only meeting with Anakin Skywalker -- eyes like pollution, and the stink of blood around him. \n\n\u00a0\n\nBut Owen also remembers how close they came to disaster that night. Two or three times a week he wakes drenched in sweat, sobbing, as those three shots-that-never-came echo in his head. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\nA blaster pointed at the cradle\u00a0--\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo, they have their compromise. It isn\u2019t a great one, but it is all they have: Luke does not leave Tattooine. \n\n\u00a0\n\nLuke grows up feral and loved and \n\ntrapped\n\n and every passing year he chafes against it more. \n\n\u00a0\n\nBut he is a child, and he does not understand. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n--\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the time he \n\ndoes \n\nunderstand, it is too late and he screams his grief in the Falcon. The security lights gutter and an alarm, somewhere, starts to wail. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey kid!\u201d says Han, sticking his head into Luke\u2019s room. \u201cWhatever Force shit you\u2019re doing --\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd he stops. Luke is hunched over, his teeth showing. He rocks back and forth \n\nkeening\n\n. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe Death Star is just ash scattered across the stars. They\u2019ve won. \n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd they haven\u2019t. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIs it -- Ben --?\u201d hazards Han. \n\n\u00a0\n\nLuke lifts his head up. His face is a red, snotty mess. He looks all of twelve years old. \u201cIt\u2019s everyone,\u201d he says.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBehind him, his shadow is winged and \n\nhuge \n\n-- but Han doesn\u2019t see that, he sees a boy weeping, he sees his \n\nfriend\n\n weeping, and he gathers him up into a hug. Luke clings.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNo one can cling quite like Luke. Han\u2019s back is grabbed at by what feel like a multitude of needles -- feathers? Tiny tentacles? -- and even his heart feels squeezed. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t save them,\u201d sobs the wonderterror son of Anakin Skywalker.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPart Force, perhaps, but entirely, entirely human. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n--\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuke vanishes into a snowstorm on Hoth. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s attacked by a particularly stupid wampa. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHan finds him comfortable snuggled up in a cave, wearing a new wampa-skin cloak and picking his teeth with a fragment of wampa fingerbone. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat was yummy,\u201d says Luke, grinning like a spring day. \u201cShall we head back?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nHan makes a thin strangled sound that translates, basically, to \n\nfucking Skywalkers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHan arrives into Cloud City wearing a wampa-skin coat. It\u2019s a little heavy, but it\u2019s the fanciest thing he owns -- the collar puffing white around his throat, the fur spangling silver -- and, given that Lando hasn\u2019t toned down his fashion sense any, Han feels he\u2019s got to be on par.\n\n\u00a0\n\nLeia tuts at him, rolls her eyes (aren\u2019t they as gorgeous and black as the void between stars -- ) and leaves Han and Lando to their manly nonsense. \n\n\u00a0\n\n(\n\nhey do you remember when we got married -- )\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(did we ever get divorced -- )\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd then it all goes to hell. But afterwards, they catch Luke -- he goes from dangling from the belly of a ship to the Millennium Falcon, and as he falls, he blisters and sparks and glows, like a shooting star. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n--\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the first Death Star was obliterated, smudged across the stars in dust and rubble, Han takes Luke\u2019s virginity. \n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s his most terrifying lay to date. Luke gasps \n\nyes \n\nand \n\nplease\n\n like any normal human -- but he also says \n\nget inside me \n\nin a downright predatory way, and his eyes shimmer like heat haze in the desert, and when he comes his skin splits open and from within his chest writhes out a --\n\n\u00a0\n\nHan blacks out. \n\n\u00a0\n\nLater, Luke drapes over his chest and says, \u201cWas that good for you too?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cKid,\u201d says Han, sincerely, \u201cthat was the best sex I have ever had.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVader is blind. \n\n\u00a0\n\nVader is useless and blind, Vader is amputated from what made Anakin Skywalker great. Vader carries his prison within himself, and has long forgotten what it is to spread out his wings and touch the stars. \n\n\u00a0\n\nPalpatine is sickened by his weakness. He remembers Anakin Skywalker -- the wonderterror too bright to gaze upon -- and remembers how sweet it was to hold the chain that bound him. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThere are two alternatives. It took him an absurdly long time to find the girl -- she clamps her heart tight to her ribs, holding herself with great, grave dignity and terrible pride. She has an absurd -- an \n\nobscene\n\n -- level of self-control. It is nothing short of criminal how her potential has been squandered. Those filthy politicians who raised her stamped humanity on her bones, and taught her that the universe had \n\nrules\n\n and that there was \n\nfairness\n\n to be found between the uncaring stars. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe boy is mildly more promising. His kindness is palpable. He makes friends too easily, gathering the weak and useless to him, defending them with the sweep of his wide, white wings. He smiles often, and means every one of those smiles; there is no falsehood to him. \n\n\u00a0\n\nBut: he doesn\u2019t have his sister\u2019s self control. He was raised on a hell-world. He learned hunger from an early age. \n\n\u00a0\n\nBesides -- there was once a man called Anakin Skywalker, and he smiled readily, and he had friends, and he protected the useless and frail. And look what happened to him. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuke tastes blood on his breath, flesh between his teeth, ash in his throat. He is \n\nhungry\n\n. No: he is \n\nstarving\n\n. \n\n\u00a0\n\nFamine has eaten him to bones and flesh, and the barest trace of flesh at that.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe universe is full of power, ripe with it, singing with life. Stars are circled by neat little planets, and those planets swarm with everything living, souls that shine in the dark In that moment, Luke sees them all. He remembers how womp rats crackled and burned black at his touch. He remembers how the wampa had tasted, fresh and hot in the snow. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHan, Leia, Chewie, Ben: all his. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThey all belonged to him. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe universe belonged to him, and he could slake his thirst with rivers of blood and his hunger with every life that belonged to him -- which was, coincidentally, all of them -- \n\n\u00a0\n\n-- and all he needs to do is kill this empty husk of a man.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNot even a man. \n\n\u00a0\n\nLuke hacks his father\u2019s hand off. Wires crackle and spark. \n\n\u00a0\n\nLuke stares at the hand, severed and flexing and useless, and he tastes blood, he sees the universe, he sees every bit of it, it is his, all of it, his birthright, he is the child of everything ancient and he will feed and -- \n\n\n\n\n\n\n--\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo. \n\n\u00a0\n\n(look at his hand. Look how broken it is, how frail, what honour is there in killing a man hapless at your feet --)\n\n\u00a0\n\nLuke is human. Luke is the grandson of the Force. Luke is a monster. Luke is hungry. Luke drinks blood by the gallon. Luke cradles the weak and helpless to his heart. All of these things are true. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat is most true is this: he is a good man. \n\n\u00a0\n\nLuke casts his lightsabre aside, and his limbs -- his wings and teeth, and appendages that there are no human word for -- twine around a second, suddenly emerged, set of limbs and wings and mouths and teeth. Anakin Skywalker breathes his guttering last, and his shining other form -- his Force-self, his wonderterror heart -- entwined with his son. \n\n\u00a0\n\nIn that moment, Anakin sees everything.\n\n\u00a0"
