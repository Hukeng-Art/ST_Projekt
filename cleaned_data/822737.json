    "notes": "<p>For all intents and purposes pretend mostly everything that happens in seasons one and two somehow still happens without Stiles being there. Even though I\u2019m reasonably sure every single one of them would have died before the end of season two if not for Stiles\u2019 involvement (and also, obviously, Scott never would have been bitten in the first place, but let\u2019s not go placing blame). </p>\n<p>Also, I decided to keep the whole big happy family alive and still on the show and not faffing off to do crappy CW shit because I figure this is the last chance I will ever have to write Jackson and Erica before they are canonically killed or written off. </p>\n<p>EXCEPT PETER. Peter\u2026I don\u2019t know, ran off to Rio to hang out with some old friends or something. </p>\n<p>ALSO, I started writing this before a lot of the season three spoilers really started getting pushed, otherwise it would probably be a lot darker and a lot harder to keep Stiles in the dark, because I\u2019m just saying that trailer makes it look like \u201ccollateral damage\u201d is a big theme this season\u2026</p>\n<p>TL;DR: Jackson and Erica are alive and well and still in Beacon Hills in this story, but Peter isn\u2019t, not too many season three spoilers, have a nice day.</p>\n<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#work_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)</p>\n<p>Also, this story is in honor of my amazing beta Allison\u2019s birthday, because without her I\u2019d probably still be fumbling around writing fuck all nothing.

    "text": "Sometimes Stiles feels a little bit guilty about considering such a massacre to be the best thing that\u2019s happened to him in the last five years. Okay, he doesn\u2019t really. He knows he should feel guilty about it, because some psycho teenager going on a rampage through a precinct and killing the majority of the night shift is actually the kind of tragedy that Stiles has nightmares about happening at his dad\u2019s department in Lakeport. But it\u2019s not his dad\u2019s department, not anymore, because when Matt Dahler decimated the Beacon Hills Police Department he also shot the sheriff (but he did not shoot the deputy) (but actually, he didn\u2019t shoot any of the deputies, which is bullet point number one on Stiles\u2019 List of Reasons Why Matt Dahler Definitely Had an Accomplice, Dad These Things Are Important). Anyway, Matt Dahler shot the Beacon Hills Sheriff, and the surviving members of the force had elected to remain on active duty to try and make up for their losses, which meant they needed to import a new acting sheriff until the next election. So yes, Stiles knows he should feel so, so guilty about being grateful for what happened, but he really doesn\u2019t. How can he? His dad\u2019s been promoted, which means a raise, and more forgiving hours, and less of a chance of him getting brutally slaughtered on the job. His dad\u2019s been made Acting Sheriff of Beacon Hills, and Beacon Hills is an hour drive from their house in Lakeport, and that means they get to move. Move out of the house his mother died in, move out of the town that still levels lingering sympathetic stares on the Stilinskis, so recently marked by their own, much smaller (but no less devastating) massacre. Move out of the high school Stiles barely exists in, ghosting through the halls and interacting with his peers only long enough to satisfy the participation requirements that keep his grades perfect. But that\u2019s all over, because they\u2019re leaving, moving, off to Beacon Hills, where there\u2019s a Sheriff badge and a new house and a new school. And where there\u2019s werewolves. Oh yeah, Stiles is so ready for this.\n Moving sucks. This surprises exactly no one, even Stiles, but he was still kind of hoping that his excitement about actually relocating to a new town would outweigh the ongoing irritation of packing, transporting boxes, and last but oh god not at all least, unpacking. He tries to rationalize it as being super productive months ahead of schedule. Stiles had systematically done a massive spring cleaning of his old room when he unpacked, dragging garbage bags full of childhood crap to dumpsters and Salvation Army drop boxes, and now that he\u2019s culled the mass chaos down to the minimum it\u2019ll make packing for college in two years just that much easier. He uses this mindset to force himself through the first six hours of unpacking his new room, the bribe of pizza to help unpack the kitchen, the after-dinner burst of energy to tackle another few boxes in his room again. It\u2019s a little too close to midnight when Stiles finally tells himself he\u2019s been plenty productive today, and he\u2019s totally within his right to dig out his running sneakers and further investigate the woodsy trail that skirts the border of their backyard. Which, really, is an epically bad idea. It\u2019s almost midnight, and the way the trail loops comfortingly close to the perimeter of his and his neighbors\u2019 yards is deceptive \u2013 Stiles is going deeper and deeper into the woods with every footfall, and it\u2019s so, so dark that if the moon wasn\u2019t nearly-full he\u2019d probably be stumbling blind. Also, if the moon wasn\u2019t nearly fully he probably wouldn\u2019t notice the definitive silhouette of someone else out there, twenty yards ahead, back flat against a tree trunk like maybe Stiles won\u2019t notice. It\u2019d be impossible for him not to notice, even if he wasn\u2019t running straight towards it, because there\u2019s no way to miss the way two flat, golden eyes glow through the darkness at him. \u201cUm, hello?\u201d Stiles calls, slowing to a cautious jog as he draws up closer, only ten yards away now. It\u2019s a guy, he\u2019s pretty sure. \u201cAre you \u2013\u201d Five yards away, and then Stiles sees it. The shaft of an arrow jutting up out of the meaty part of the guy\u2019s shoulder, embedded deeply enough to keep him pinned to the tree. \u201cShit man, fuck,\u201d Stiles spits, careening to a stop so suddenly he nearly loses his balance. His arms pinwheel madly for a second as he attempts to regain control, and he hears something that sounds suspiciously like a slightly hysterical giggle from the guy impaled on a tree. \u201cYou\u2019re aware you have an arrow through your arm, right?\u201d Stiles snaps back defensively, reflexively. He winces almost immediately, shaking his head. \u201cNo wait, that\u2019s horrible, I \u2013\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t get it out.\u201d The guy sounds\u2026off. He\u2019s in pain, for sure, but not nearly as much pain as he should be in, given the circumstances. And his voice is rough, thick, like he\u2019s talking through a ragged sore throat and around a tongue too big for his mouth, and even though the whole situation is creepy as fuck and Stiles should really, really get the hell out of Dodge\u2026he takes a few cautious steps closer. And there it is. The yellow-gold eyes are separated by a thick, ridged nose that seems like an extension of a heavily ribbed forehead, framed on the sides by furry sideburns and on the bottom by a mouthful of fangs. It\u2019s not pretty, and it\u2019s not at all what Stiles ever imagined, curled up next to his mother hearing her paint pictures full of howling wolves and silver moonlight, but there\u2019s no denying it. \u201cI thought werewolves were supposed to be super strong. And like, healing powers or something.\u201d The guy\u2019s golden eyes bulge slightly, jaw dropping a little as he looks at Stiles\u2019 perfectly crafted innocent nonchalance. \u201cI\u2019m not \u2013 there\u2019s no such \u2013\u201d the werewolf splutters. As if that\u2019s fooling anyone. \u201cYou are, there are,\u201d Stiles scoffs, because he\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019s right and he\u2019s also pretty sure they don\u2019t have time for this. \u201cDo you want my help or not?\u201d \u201cI\u2026\u201d He sounds frustrated, conflicted, a heavy weight on a single letter. Stiles thinks there\u2019s probably some kind of great internal upheaval between human and animal instincts right now \u2013 the human side of this man wants to say yes, but the animal instinct would never accept help from a potential threat. \u201cI\u2019m not a hunter,\u201d Stiles tells him. He raises both hands to shoulder height, palms out, and slouches slightly in an effort to make a less imposing figure. \u201cI promise. My name\u2019s Stiles, I\u2019m a junior in high school. My dad and I just moved here this week. He\u2019s the new sheriff, and I\u2019m nothing if not a cop\u2019s son, which means I can\u2019t in good conscience leave you out here on your own.\u201d There\u2019s silence for a long moment, and Stiles lets it sit. He means it wholeheartedly, and if it takes a few minutes of thinking about it for the guy to believe him, that\u2019s okay. \u201cScott,\u201d the werewolf says finally, breaking the quiet stretching between them. \u201cOkay.\u201d \u201cHey Scott,\u201d Stiles says gently. He\u2019s taking a few more steps forward, carefully keeping both his hands visible, until he and Scott are only a few feet apart. \u201cHow can I help?\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t touch the arrow shaft,\u201d Scott grits out. \u201cWolfsbane. And I don\u2019t have\u2026\u201d he gestures helplessly at his shirtless torso. \u201cAnything to use as oven mitts,\u201d Stiles nods. He closes the final step between them, close enough now that he can reach out and put one hand gingerly on Scott\u2019s uninjured shoulder. \u201cOkay, we can work with that. I don\u2019t think I can pull it out on my own though. If I get a good, solid grip you think you can help me pull?\u201d Scott just nods. He looks younger than Stiles had originally guessed, now that Stiles is closer. More like Stiles\u2019 age, which sends another pang of sympathy through him, because that means he\u2019s just a kid, and werewolf or not no kid deserves to be pinned to a tree by a freaking arrow through his body. Stiles squeezes his shoulder lightly, just once, before switching his hand to the other side, wrapping his fingers around the arrow shaft as gently as possible. Scott winces anyway, grits his teeth when Stiles brings his free hand up to hold Scott\u2019s shoulder back against the tree trunk, but he still dutifully twists his own fingers around Stiles\u2019 wrist. \u201cOn three,\u201d Stiles tells him. Scott nods again. \u201cOne, two, three.\u201d Scott doesn\u2019t make a sound as they slowly, painstakingly pull the arrow back through his body. It\u2019s like trying to drag through tar, through sticky-thick molasses, and Stiles has never been more impressed in his life with the literal grit-your-teeth-and-bear-it Scott\u2019s managing. It pulls clean with a forceful tug that, if Scott didn\u2019t still have a firm hold on Stiles\u2019 wrist, would have thrown Stiles back on his ass in a heartbeat. Scott doesn\u2019t let him fall, though he does immediately hunch away from the tree, curling in on himself until he\u2019s nearly doubled over. The hole in his shoulder isn\u2019t healing. \u201cBut actually, I thought you guys had super healing,\u201d Stiles says, and even though the wording is flippant he can\u2019t hide the concern in his tone. He\u2019s contemplating tossing the arrow as far as he can into the woods, like just the proximity of the kryptonite is affecting Scott, but Scott shakes his head before he even starts moving. \u201cSave that,\u201d he groans at Stiles. \u201cWe might need it. Do you have a phone?\u201d Stiles shakes his head regretfully, because even he can acknowledge that that\u2019s possibly his dumbest move of the night. It\u2019s one thing to go out on a run, alone, at midnight, in the woods, in a strange neighborhood, but to not bring his cell phone with him? He was totally asking for trouble there, and now it\u2019s coming back to bite him in the ass. Scott moans a little, fingers coming up to scrabble uselessly against his bloody shoulder, and Stiles makes another game time decision. \u201cMy house is only like, maybe half a mile back down this trail,\u201d he tells Scott, crouching down to get closer to the other boy\u2019s eye level and gesturing back the way he came. \u201cIf you can make it that far I\u2019m pretty sure the land line\u2019s hooked up, and even if it\u2019s not we can grab my phone, call 911.\u201d Scott shakes his head, but the way he\u2019s gingerly straightening upright makes Stiles think it\u2019s maybe not the house he\u2019s saying no to. \u201cNot 911,\u201d he insists. \u201cVet.\u201d Stiles snorts derisively, despite how kind of not funny this situation is. \u201cA vet,\u201d he snickers. \u201cThere are so many jokes, so little time. Dude.\u201d \u201cHe knows things,\u201d Scott protests, shooting Stiles a look that is simultaneously withering and not all that heated. \u201cHe can help.\u201d Stiles just shakes his head, smirking. Scott seems fairly steady on his feet, even if he is listing to the side slightly and definitely, shamelessly favoring his right shoulder. They make good time, walking in oddly companionable silence, and they\u2019re at the back fence of the house Stiles vaguely hopes is his own before too long. \u201cMy dad\u2019s asleep,\u201d Stiles warns Scott, taking extra care to twist the knob on the kitchen door, slowly ease the door open. \u201cI can hear him,\u201d Scott nods, tapping his ear lightly. \u201cI\u2019ll know if he wakes up.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s either cool or creepy,\u201d Stiles mumbles back, keeping his voice low. \u201cI\u2019m leaning towards cool.\u201d Scott grins at him. Somewhere along the way he lost all but the edges of his wolfy features \u2013 his eyes are still a little flashy, he still has claws instead of fingernails, but for the most part he looks like any other kid Stiles will be going to school with in a few weeks. The kitchen phone echoes a dull dial tone at them when Stiles lifts it experimentally from the receiver. Scott\u2019s still moving slowly, still winces at the stretch of skin across his wound when he goes to take the phone from Stiles, but the bleeding has stopped and that\u2019s nothing if not progress. Stiles deposits the wrecked arrow on the countertop anyway, turns away to give Scott the illusion of privacy as he busies himself with scrubbing his hands clean and digging out paper plates and leftover pizza. The conversation Scott has with his vet leaves Scott sounding disappointed and resigned. Stiles focuses his attention on the soft ticking of the toaster oven, trying to anticipate the ding of the timer before it can wake his dad while still giving the pizza slice as much time as possible to heat up, and by the time he hears the telltale click of the phone being hung up he\u2019s got a decently re-heated slice of pizza ready to hand off to Scott. \u201cThanks,\u201d Scott says gratefully, accepting the plate with his good hand and dropping it onto the table where he\u2019s sitting. \u201cWhat\u2019s the word from the good doc?\u201d Stiles asks, sliding his own slice onto the toaster tray. Scott\u2019s already got a solid mouthful of cheesy pizza by the time Stiles turns back to look at him, and he doesn\u2019t bother swallowing before he tries to talk. \u201cNothing,\u201d he mumbles around the slice. \u201cThe wolfsbane slowed down the healing, but it wasn\u2019t strong enough to actually poison me so I just have to let it heal on its own.\u201d \u201cDude, you have a gaping hole in your arm,\u201d Stiles points out bluntly, nodding over to Scott\u2019s shoulder like maybe he didn\u2019t notice. Except, maybe he didn\u2019t, because now that Stiles is looking at it\u2026well, it doesn\u2019t look better, but it looks less gruesome than it did twenty minutes ago. \u201cIt\u2019s healing,\u201d Scott grumbles. \u201cJust slowly.\u201d Stiles is torn between how fucking cool that is and his slightly neurotic belief that all wounds should be duly treated as quickly as possible. There\u2019s dirt and sweat and blood all over Scott\u2019s skin, caked into the jagged edges around the wound. \u201cCan we at least like, clean it or something?\u201d he offers, trying not to sound too petulant about it. The toaster dings before Scott can answer, because Stiles totally forgot to watch the timer. He glances instinctively up at the ceiling, like he can see through to his dad\u2019s new bedroom, but Scott\u2019s shaking his head on the other side of the kitchen. \u201cHe\u2019s still asleep,\u201d he mutters, nodding in the direction of the Sheriff\u2019s bedroom. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. And I don\u2019t think I can get an infection anyway, so what\u2019s the point?\u201d \u201cYou look like an extra in a horror film,\u201d Stiles offers shortly. \u201cAlthough I guess it could be rugged and badass, if you rock it just right.\u201d Scott grins at him. \u201cYou\u2019re fun,\u201d he announces, nodding definitively. \u201cYou said you were a junior?\u201d \u201cOr I will be, in a few weeks,\u201d Stiles nods. \u201cI guess at Beacon Hills High School now.\u201d \u201cCool,\u201d Scott\u2019s grin widens. \u201cYeah, me too. That\u2019s awesome man, welcome. Where are you from, anyway?\u201d \u201cLakeport.\u201d Stiles isn\u2019t actually hungry, the pizza more of a reflexive urge than anything else. Scott\u2019s looking at it like it\u2019s a particularly tempting bunny though, and Stiles only rolls his eyes a little bit as he holds it out to the other teen. \u201cLike, about an hour east?\u201d \u201cOh yeah, we play them in lacrosse.\u201d Scott accepts the second slice with a grin on his face like Stiles just proposed. \u201cThat\u2019s cool. Bummer to move so late into high school though.\u201d \u201cNah,\u201d Stiles shrugs. He doesn\u2019t know how to say I hated that town, that school, and everyone in it and would move to the moon if it meant I\u2019d never have to set foot there ever again, so he doesn\u2019t bother. Scott seems to hear it anyway. He actually pauses mid-bite, leveling Stiles with a lingering, contemplative look, before nodding carefully and tearing a hunk out of his pizza. \u201cFair enough,\u201d he says easily. \u201cBesides, Lakeport isn\u2019t half as cool as Beacon Hills.\u201d \u201cObviously,\u201d Stiles rolls his eyes. \u201cPretty sure Lakeport doesn\u2019t have werewolves.\u201d Scott finishes chewing before he shoots another look Stiles\u2019 direction, and it\u2019s just as calculating as the last one. \u201cSo, how\u2019d you know then?\u201dDon\u2019t be afraid of the dark, pup. Maybe there are monsters out there, but there\u2019s good things too, beautiful things, and they\u2019ll always be there to protect you. \u201cStories,\u201d Stiles tells him softly. \u201cMy mom used to tell me all kinds of stories about them. It took me a while to figure out they weren\u2019t just stories. Besides,\u201d he shrugs, \u201cmountain lions? In Beacon Hills? Really?\u201d Scott grins bashfully, shaking his head. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like Buffy,\u201d he chuckles. \u201cTown on top of the freaking Hellmouth and people still don\u2019t seem to realize there\u2019s more vampires than actual people living there.\u201d \u201cPoint,\u201d Stiles concedes. He smiles tentatively back, which only makes Scott\u2019s grin grow wider. He\u2019s interrupted from whatever response he was planning, though, cocking his head to the side not unlike a dog. \u201cMy ride\u2019s here,\u201d he announces instead. He pushes himself up off the chair he\u2019d been perched on, stretching across the kitchen to dump the empty plates into the garbage can by the wall. Stiles follows Scott to the front door, flipping the locks and tugging it open as silently as possible, leaning one shoulder against the frame as Scott pauses on the front stoop, turns back around to give Stiles one more searching look. \u201cThanks,\u201d Scott tells him, genuine sincerity oozing from his every feature. \u201cI mean it. Not a lot of people would have done what you did.\u201d \u201cAnytime,\u201d Stiles mumbled shyly, not particularly used to such earnestness directed toward him. \u201cIf you ever need help\u2026\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d Scott nods. \u201cDefinitely, yeah.\u201d There\u2019s a car idling at the curb \u2013 sleek, black, the kind of car that makes you simultaneously think overcompensating\u2026but I\u2019d probably fuck him anyway. The windows are closed and tinted enough that Stiles can\u2019t see inside, but that doesn\u2019t seem to stop Scott. He rolls his eyes and mumbles something under his breath before giving Stiles the long-suffering expression of dealing with useless authority figures that all teenagers have mastered. \u201cTry not to get shot on your way home,\u201d Stiles calls after him, quietly enough that the neighbors won\u2019t hear. Scott, with his apparently amplified werewolf hearing, turns back just long enough to toss another grin over his shoulder at Stiles before he ducks down and disappears into the car. Stiles stands in the doorway watching until the Camaro swings around the corner and out of sight, letting himself bask in the warm feeling in his stomach that something life changing just happened.\n Stiles wakes up the next morning to a friend request from Scott McCall and an invitation for an afternoon of Black Ops, and they go from there. It\u2019s stupidly easy the way Stiles, who can\u2019t remember the last time he actually tried to make a friend, and Scott fall together, and by the time school starts up three weeks later they\u2019ve struck up a pretty solid bro-ship. Scott instructs Stiles to meet him by his locker before first period so they can compare schedules, and while they\u2019re disappointed they\u2019re not particularly surprised when they don\u2019t have any overlapping classes. He still painstakingly pours over Stiles\u2019 classes, mumbling comments about teachers and people Stiles might encounter. \u201cLydia will definitely be in these,\u201d he tells Stiles, pointing to the three APs Stiles has that afternoon. \u201cShe probably won\u2019t give you the time of day, to be honest, because that\u2019s Lydia. She\u2019s pack though, kind of, so she definitely knows about you. Don\u2019t be weirded out if you catch her staring.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m very used to the ignoring part,\u201d Stiles shrugs. \u201cBesides, isn\u2019t she the one with the scaly boyfriend?\u201d Part of their bonding over the last few weeks has included Scott filling Stiles in on what\u2019s really been happening in Beacon Hills these last few months. He seems overwhelmingly relieved to be able to talk about it \u2013 to open the front door before Stiles even knocks, to boldly say he can literally smell the leftover lasagna in the fridge can we please take a food break, Stiles? Stiles gets the impression that Scott, for all that there are definitely other werewolves in the town, doesn\u2019t get to talk about it much and is grateful for the opportunity to do so. Stiles isn\u2019t used to people being grateful for his presence \u2013 he definitely doesn\u2019t hate it. \u201cYeah, so you don\u2019t really want to touch that with a ten foot pole anyway,\u201d Scott agrees. \u201cAnd you have lunch\u2026huh, fourth. Hang on, lemme find out of anyone else has that.\u201d He fumbles for his cell phone with his free hand, and Stiles takes the break to look around the crowded hallway they\u2019re loitering in. There\u2019s been a few guys in letterman jackets throwing bro-nods-of-acknowledgment at \u201cMcCall,\u201d a few girls doing double takes at Stiles after smiling slyly at Scott, but for the most part they go unnoticed. \u201cOkay, so Isaac has lunch with you, and I think Jackson might too. Don\u2019t even bother with Jackson, but Isaac might be cool,\u201d Scott bumps his shoulder against Stiles\u2019, grinning at him. \u201cHe was like, super quiet for a long time, then a raging douche for a little while, and now he\u2019s somewhere in the middle, so it\u2019s hard to tell with him.\u201d \u201cYou guys are friends though, right?\u201d Stiles frowns at him. He still working on figuring out what\u2019s going on with the relationships Scott\u2019s been filling him in on \u2013 from what he can tell half of these people barely acknowledged each other\u2019s existence before they shared a mutual strain of lycanthropy. Scott nods. \u201cYeah, I guess. More than I am with any of the others, anyway, but \u2013\u201d The ringing bell cuts him off, signaling the five minute warning before first period starts, and Scott\u2019s grin turns apologetic. \u201cCrap, I gotta go, it\u2019s gonna take the whole five minutes to get to gym.\u201d He hoists his backpack up onto his shoulder, slams his locker behind him. \u201cRemember where you\u2019re going?\u201d Stiles nods, taking his schedule back from Scott. Scott had given him directions to his first period Physics class, and while Stiles wasn\u2019t exactly confident he wasn\u2019t completely convinced he was going to get shamelessly lost, so that\u2019s a start. He makes it there without a problem though, and true to Scott\u2019s word there\u2019s no horrifying, teen-rom-com-esque introduction scene with Stiles standing in front of the class and reciting Ten Fun Facts About Me. He slumps into a seat somewhere in the neutral middle of the class, offers the teacher an easy cop out of \u201cStiles is fine\u201d when he gets to Stilinski on the attendance sheet and his eyes bug out of his head, and that\u2019s about it. Nobody really pays him any attention, and Stiles is totally okay with that. He\u2019s busy studying his classmates, listening closely to the roll call, trying to spot any of the names Scott\u2019s mentioned over the last few weeks. There\u2019s an Allison Argent in his Physics class, and despite the fact that Scott has never once mentioned her all the alarm bells are ringing in Stiles\u2019 head. He\u2019s read all the newspaper articles, followed the whole story from Laura Hale\u2019s murder to the mysterious disappearance of Principal Gerard Argent, he knows who she is. Knows she\u2019s involved. She\u2019s quiet. Keeps to herself, doesn\u2019t speak to anyone. She does look twice at Stiles though, like she\u2019s noticed him noticing her, and while she doesn\u2019t ignore his careful nod of acknowledgment when she catches his eye she doesn\u2019t return it either. There\u2019s a blonde girl who sniffs twice and zeroes in on him barely a second after she steps foot inside Stiles\u2019 third period Economics class, a black guy who sits pointedly in the seat behind Stiles but doesn\u2019t say a word to him in seventh period. Lydia Martin, as promised, is in AP Calc, AP English Lang, and AP US History with him, and also as promised doesn\u2019t even look at him, though she definitely perks to attention when the teacher calls his name for attendance. By the end of the day Stiles is pretty sure he\u2019s identified the pack members that Scott\u2019s mentioned, and even the one he didn\u2019t, and despite the fact that most of them made a point of not acknowledging him it was pretty damn obvious they all recognized him. The only real interaction was at lunch. Stiles had no qualms about sitting by himself for lunch \u2013 he let the cafeteria fill naturally, didn\u2019t try to fight anyone for pre-established territory or anything, and settled down at the empty end of a table against the far wall. He\u2019s two bites into an unidentifiable slices-of-meat-on-a-bun sandwich when he\u2019s startled by the sound of another tray clattering onto the table across from his, a tall, lanky boy with messy hair folding down into the empty chair. \u201cStiles, right?\u201d he says quietly. \u201cYup,\u201d Stiles nods. \u201cIsaac?\u201d Isaac nods back, scoops up a forkful of what might actually be instant mac and cheese, and doesn\u2019t say another word for the rest of the period. All in all, Stiles is okay with it. He\u2019s on their radar, they\u2019re on his radar, Scott\u2019s \u201cchecking in\u201d with texts that blow up his pocket between every period, and while there\u2019s nothing particularly exciting about it it\u2019s still the best first day of school Stiles has had since fifth grade.\n \u201cIsaac?\u201d Stiles swings the kitchen door wide and Isaac doesn\u2019t hesitate to duck under Stiles\u2019 outstretched arm and hustle inside. He\u2019s barefoot, and the rip in his sleeve is caked with blood even though the skin underneath looks unscathed, and there\u2019s something frantic in his eyes that freeze Stiles\u2019 questions on his tongue. \u201cCome on, bro,\u201d he says instead, slamming the door shut and sliding all three locks home. \u201cUpstairs.\u201d He ushers Isaac through a painfully brief and awkward introduction to his dad that mostly consists of Stiles mumbling \u201cheydadthisisIsaacwe\u2019regoingtostudyforAPUSHtogetherseeyoulater,\u201d and the sheriff blinking after them. Isaac follows him without complaint, allows himself to be hustled up the stairs and into Stiles\u2019 bedroom. \u201cOkay,\u201d Stiles blows out a breath, frowns at the tentative way Isaac\u2019s still standing in the middle of his room. \u201cSit, dude. Anywhere, it doesn\u2019t matter. Sorry if the place smells like Scott, he\u2019s here a lot.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Isaac mumbles. He perches on the very edge of Stiles\u2019 desk chair, tense and rigid as a board, and fingers the dirty cuffs of his ruined shirt. \u201cHere,\u201d Stiles offers, stumbling over to his dresser and yanking drawers open. He fishes out a reasonably clean-looking shirt that he never wears, one of those long sleeve cotton shirts with the Lakeport 10K Turkey Run logo on the front and obligatory sponsorship logos on the back. Isaac accepts it gingerly but wastes no time in tugging off his old, bloodstained tee. \u201cSo\u2026\u201d Isaac\u2019s blushing when he finally shoves his head through the collar of the shirt, the frantic look fading into something more sheepish now that he\u2019s safely behind several locked doors. They\u2019re barely, barely friends \u2013 they\u2019ve been working their way towards a few mumbled comments back and forth during lunch, the bare bones of a conversation, and have spent a few overlapping afternoons at Scott\u2019s together, but if Isaac wasn\u2019t a werewolf, and if Scott wasn\u2019t Stiles\u2019 best friend (because he is. That\u2019s a thing. And yes, Stiles is man enough to admit it still kind of leaves a warm, fuzzy feeling in his ribcage.) Stiles would have a hell of a lot of questions right now. Okay fine, he still has a hell of a lot of questions. But at least he let Isaac in the door first. \u201cSorry,\u201d Isaac says finally, and he really does sound guilty. \u201cI know it\u2019s really weird showing up here like this.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s cool,\u201d Stiles shrugs, like he\u2019s not burning with questions. \u201cI just mean, well. You know.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m barefoot and bloody and showing up unannounced at your back door at eleven at night?\u201d Isaac guesses grimly. He\u2019s not looking at Stiles, fixated now on picking at the torn sleeve on the shirt still in his lap. Stiles doesn\u2019t know that much about Isaac beyond Scott\u2019s general summary of he was like, super quiet for a long time, then a raging douche for a little while, and now he\u2019s somewhere in the middle. He\u2019s got the kind of dry, wry humor Stiles appreciates and most of their lunchtime interactions include mumbled judgment of the dramatic happenings of the day in the cafeteria. He opens up a bit more around Scott, though he seems to be constantly looking to Scott like Isaac needs to follow his friend\u2019s lead, and that alone is enough for Stiles to know Isaac showing up here alone is probably a Big Thing. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome here, dude,\u201d Stiles tells him. He thinks Isaac is the kind of person that needs to be told these things, even if they seem obvious and unspoken. \u201cI mean, anytime.\u201d \u201cThanks,\u201d Isaac nods, finally glancing up just enough to flick his gaze over to where Stiles is sitting on the bed. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026thanks.\u201d Stiles shrugs, says nothing. He\u2019s dying to ask, dying, but he doesn\u2019t want to push and he\u2019s not going to if he can help it. He isn\u2019t above letting silence do the work for him though; he lets the pair of them stew in it for a few long, quiet moments before Isaac looks over at him again. \u201cI should probably call someone,\u201d Isaac says. \u201cI was patrolling with Jackson and we got separated, and I didn\u2019t really want to draw attention to us by calling out for him and I knew you lived nearby and I figured\u2026\u201d \u201cWhat is it with you guys and not having your phones on you?\u201d Stiles grumbles, rolling his eyes as he shoves his fingers into his pocket, fishing around for a good grip on his cell. \u201cDon\u2019t have one,\u201d Isaac tells him. Stiles pauses, looks up long enough to blink owlishly at him. Isaac looks somewhere between sheepish and defensive. \u201cMy foster parents say it isn\u2019t necessary,\u201d he supplies. \u201cDerek offered to buy me one, add me to his plan, but\u2026\u201d he trails off again, shrugging. \u201cDunno, it\u2019s kind of nice not being tied down like that.\u201d \u201cUntil you\u2019re on a late night jaunt through the woods and get separated from Jackass,\u201d Stiles points out, tossing his phone over. The throw\u2019s probably too wide, but Isaac reaches out and snatches it out of the air easily, lips quirking in a pantomime of a smile when he meets Stiles\u2019 eye. \u201cThat\u2019s what Derek said,\u201d he admits. \u201cAnd what he\u2019s going to say again now when I call him.\u201d Stiles just nods. He\u2019s moving forward delicately here. Scott talks about the pack, and Stiles himself has gathered plenty of intel (because even if they don\u2019t talk to him they\u2019re still there, and Stiles pays enough attention to know that Jackson is a jackass and Lydia is secretly brilliant and Erica uses stilettos and push up bras as a shield instead of a weapon and Boyd will always, always sit behind Stiles even if Stiles changes his seat), but they never talk about the alpha. He knows it\u2019s Derek Hale, knows the sketchy skeleton of the Hale family\u2019s immediate history and a few hazy details Scott\u2019s filled in, but for the most part Scott avoids talking about Derek almost as much as he avoids talking about Allison Argent, and Stiles is so, so curious. Isaac doesn\u2019t offer up any more commentary on Derek though \u2013 goes instead straight for the phone call. Isaac\u2019s responses are pointed and concise with extremely short pauses between each one, like Derek\u2019s only asking the bare minimum in as few words as possible. \u201cJackson and I got separated.\u201d \u201cYeah, it was them.\u201d \u201cOnly one, I think.\u201d \u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201d \u201cAt Stiles\u2019 house.\u201d \u201cYeah, it\u2019s fine.\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cI know, Derek.\u201d He sounds, and looks, like a kid pushing the boundaries of a conversation with an older brother, knowing full well the conversation could snap from easy and docile to an all out brawl at the slightest provocation. Stiles doesn\u2019t particularly like it. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, I\u2019ll call Scott. I have to go back to the Gallagher\u2019s tonight anyway. Yeah. Yeah. Later.\u201d Isaac hangs up with a muted kind of finality before lobbing the phone back to Stiles in a soft underhand throw. Stiles still doesn\u2019t quite manage to catch it, but at least it lands on the soft surface of his bed. \u201cDerek sounds like a charmer,\u201d Stiles says drily, because he\u2019s never been good at keeping his judgment to himself. Isaac smirks. \u201cYou should try talking to him face to face,\u201d he suggests. \u201cHe could be telling you with complete sincerity that you\u2019re the prettiest girl in the room, but his face is so grr and his eyebrows are so,\u201d he curls both index fingers into angry little hooks and holds them up over his own eyebrows, \u201cyou know.\u201d Stiles laughs. He\u2019d tried to look Derek up, endless curiosity satiated only by extensive research, but other than a seven year old yearbook photo of him pitching that looks like it was taken from behind the dugout Stiles\u2019 research came up dry. \u201cI\u2019m going to remember that,\u201d he tells Isaac, pointing at his face, \u201cand have the horrible misfortune of someday running into this mysterious Alpha out in town somewhere and laugh in his growly face, and it\u2019ll be your fault.\u201d Isaac smiles at him, and while it\u2019s not one of Scott\u2019s full-blown, freely-given puppy dog grins it still kind of feels like the tentative beginning of an actual, real friendship. \u201cYou didn\u2019t want to call Scott?\u201d Stiles asks, reminded. He\u2019d been twisting his phone between his fingers since Isaac threw it back, but it hadn\u2019t even occurred to him that Isaac was supposed to make a second call. \u201cNah,\u201d Isaac shook his head, blond curls falling in disarray over his forehead. \u201cHis mom\u2019s working tonight, so it\u2019s not like he has a car to come pick me up with. I just didn\u2019t want to give Derek an excuse for another lecture on why I need a cell phone. I\u2019ll walk, it\u2019s not that far.\u201d \u201cI can drive you,\u201d Stiles offers, because he knows his dad would readily let his son take the Jeep out at midnight rather than let a seventeen year old walk home alone this late at night. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t \u2013\u201d \u201cNo, seriously,\u201d Stiles insists. Isaac nods, fingers curling and uncurling around the shirt in his lap, but neither of them actually make a move to stand up. \u201cWanna shoot zombies for a little while first?\u201d Stiles asks finally, nodding over at the pile of Xbox controllers and wires bundled under his desk. That had been his original goal for the evening, mindless zombie slaying right after he fixed himself a late-night snack, and foster parents that didn\u2019t believe in cell phones probably didn\u2019t care too much about owning video game consoles. \u201cYeah, okay.\u201d Isaac\u2019s smile is wide and bright, an actual grin now, and it changes his whole face. Stiles can\u2019t help but smile back.\n Stiles sees it coming, sees her coming, long legs strutting down the aisle towards his seat, but it\u2019s still a bit of a shock when Erica Reyes perches herself lightly on his desk, creamy white thighs and tantalizingly short mini skirt landing square on top of his Economics notebook. \u201cStilinski,\u201d she coos, as if this isn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s said boo to him in almost six weeks of class. \u201cHow\u2019s your day?\u201d \u201cGetting stranger with every passing minute,\u201d Stiles says back, pushing his chair back as far as he can in hopes of not being directly eyelevel with her frankly fantastic rack. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d \u201cI decided it\u2019s not fair,\u201d Erica announces, pouting her painted red lips at him. \u201cScotty gets to play with you, Isaac gets to play with you. How come I\u2019m missing out on all the fun?\u201d \u201cAnd you\u2019re really, really missing out,\u201d Stiles agrees, tilting his chin up to look her in the eye. \u201cWe have so much fun together.\u201d \u201cI wanna have fun,\u201d she purrs. She leans forward, bracing one hand on the edge of the desk closest to Stiles\u2019 lap, until he can\u2019t help the eyeful he\u2019s being offered on a silver platter. \u201cCan\u2019t I have fun with you too, Stiles?\u201d Stiles leans forward too, and up, pressing in until they\u2019re just shy of really violating each other\u2019s personal space, and smirks. Erica grins back delightedly, and for all its predatory gleam there\u2019s a glimmer of genuine enjoyment in her big brown eyes. \u201cSure,\u201d he nods. \u201cIsaac\u2019s coming over tonight. Bring your boyfriend.\u201d And just like that she switches gears, shifts her features until her smile really is nothing more than just satisfaction, hops up off Stiles\u2019 desk and reaches up to scratch her fingers through Stiles\u2019 already disheveled hair. \u201cCool. See you later!\u201d Three periods later Stiles waits until Boyd\u2019s comfortably settled in the desk behind his before he turns, braces one elbow on the other boy\u2019s desk. \u201cHeard you\u2019re coming over later,\u201d he says cheerfully. It\u2019s the first time Stiles has spoken to Boyd, because today is a day of firsts apparently, but just like with Erica earlier Boyd doesn\u2019t so much as blink in surprise. \u201cWhatever you do, don\u2019t cave to Isaac\u2019s demands for a Black Ops rematch,\u201d Boyd responds, crossing his arms over his broad chest. \u201cErica\u2019ll just wipe the floor with him again.\u201d \u201cNoted,\u201d Stiles agrees, smirking. Obviously, they play Black Ops. And obviously, Erica leaves Isaac (and Boyd) in the dust. Stiles kicks her ass though, and has more fun throwing smack talk back and forth than he\u2019s ever had in his life, and the standing Tuesday night tournaments quickly become his favorite night of the week.\n Cross country practice ran super late today, and Stiles had stayed after for what was supposed to be a quick conversation with the coach, so he didn\u2019t expect anyone to be left in the parking lot when he finally shuffled out of the locker room forty-five minutes later than he should have. Even Scott had left, catching a ride with Jackson Whittemore of all people, so Stiles really, really didn\u2019t expect the willowy figure leaning up against his Jeep\u2019s bumper. Which is totally, totally why he jumps and shrieks like a little girl when Allison Argent clears her throat when Stiles is only five feet away. \u201cHoly shit!\u201d he cries, hand jumping up to clutch his heart like the little old lady he secretly is. Allison almost looks amused, which is already more emotion than Stiles is used to seeing from her. \u201cJesus, you scared the crap out of me.\u201d \u201cSorry,\u201d Allison says quietly, tucking a strand of auburn hair behind her ear. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d \u201cNah,\u201d Stiles waves his hand dismissively. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Allison?\u201d She doesn\u2019t ask how, or why, Stiles knows her name. Doesn\u2019t seem surprised that he isn\u2019t surprised by her appearance (startled, yes. Surprised, no.). Stiles likes that; he appreciates people that don\u2019t bother playing games. \u201cI \u2013\u201d she falters quickly, fumbles with the strap of the purse slung across her torso. \u201cYou know, nevermind. This was \u2013 I know you\u2019re really good friends with Scott \u2013\u201d \u201cI\u2019m really good at multitasking,\u201d Stiles interrupts, flashing her a small smile. He\u2019s starting to get why Allison looks so stoic in class all the time \u2013 when she actually allows emotion to leak into her features it\u2019s a heart-wrenching, gut-punching kind of misery that makes Stiles ache in empathy. \u201cI can definitely be Scott\u2019s friend and yours at the same time.\u201d Allison\u2026well she doesn\u2019t smile, but it\u2019s like the barest hint of an expression that looks like it could be a smile. She takes a deep breath, squares her shoulders, and tries again. \u201cI just,\u201d she exhales, \u201cjust really want to talk to someone who isn\u2019t my dad, you know? Someone who knows enough that I don\u2019t have to watch what I say, but wasn\u2019t raised by hunters or bit by a werewolf or dating a guy who used to be a lizard monster or\u2026\u201d She trails off, flicks her brown eyes up to look at him. For all that he knows about Allison, painstakingly putting together pieces of newspaper articles, observations from class, things Scott and Isaac pointedly don\u2019t say, Stiles has no idea what Allison knows about him. Doesn\u2019t know if he can say I know what it\u2019s like to have the ground fall out from under your feet like that. I know what it\u2019s like to look up and realize you hate every single person in the room with you because none of them can come close to touching the hole in your heart. So instead he just nods, because lately Stiles seems to be picking up strays like a big-hearted cat lady. \u201cDo you like peanut butter?\u201d he asks. Allison blinks up and him, like she\u2019s not sure if it\u2019s a trick question. He smiles again. \u201cIt\u2019s just, I\u2019ve been craving it all day, so I was thinking about going home and throwing together a batch of peanut butter white chocolate chip cookies.\u201d \u201cI love white chocolate,\u201d Allison says quietly, tentatively. \u201cAwesome,\u201d Stiles announces, clapping his hands together before gesturing dramatically around to the passenger side door. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go. I know she looks like she\u2019s one bad pothole away from falling to pieces, but I promise this baby\u2019ll get us home safe.\u201d It takes three tries to start the Jeep, but Allison doesn\u2019t seem bothered. She even lets out a breathy, wispy little giggle when Stiles whoops triumphantly at the catch of the engine, and that\u2019s more than enough of a win for now.\n \u201cUh\u2026\u201d Stiles stands there, one hand still on the doorknob, one shielding his eyes from the harsh sun glare. It\u2019s too damn early for this, too cold for him to be standing in his open doorway wearing nothing but the boxers he slept in, too weird for him to be hallucinating Lydia Martin and Jackson Whittemore standing on his front stoop. \u201cHere,\u201d Lydia says firmly. She gives Jackson a good, hard shove that sends him careening forward, werewolf strength be damned, and crashing directly into the arm Stiles instinctively raised toward him. \u201cUh. What?\u201d Stiles tries again. He\u2019s got an armful of Jackson now, who looks miserable and horrifically put out but hasn\u2019t made any effort to move away, and Lydia looks unbearably smug. \u201cHe\u2019s broken, and Scott says you\u2019re the Werewolf Whisperer and Isaac sings your praises and Allison says you make the best cookies she\u2019s ever eaten. Fix him,\u201d Lydia instructs, tossing her long curls primly over one shoulder. \u201cRight,\u201d Stiles says dumbly, for lack of a better response. He\u2019s still got an arm around Jackson\u2019s waist while Jackson himself seems to be trying to pull some kind of twisty move that keeps his whole body away from Stiles but still allows him to bury his nose against Stiles\u2019 shoulder. \u201cUh, I guess you wanna come in?\u201d He steps back as much as Jackson will let him, pulling the door open wider, and Lydia pushes her way inside and beelines towards the kitchen like she knows exactly where it is. \u201cOkay,\u201d Stiles nods. \u201cI\u2019ll just, uh, go put some pants on?\u201d Stiles draws the line at letting Jackson follow him up the stairs.\n And just like that it becomes a thing. Well. Not in a way that is entirely noticeable on the outside. Scott and Stiles are still going strong and Stiles and Isaac talk a lot more at their lunch table now, but Jackson doesn\u2019t bring his entourage over to sit with them, Erica doesn\u2019t switch to a closer seat in Economics. Lydia and Allison don\u2019t even look at Stiles (probably for different reasons. Definitely for different reasons. Definitely because Allison is still avoiding public social interaction and Lydia is still pretending Stiles doesn\u2019t exist). But take them out of school and suddenly they know each other. Suddenly they\u2019re friends. Stiles doesn\u2019t remember the last time he was home alone for an entire afternoon, the Sheriff starts taking votes on what\u2019s for dinner, there\u2019s a designated area on Stiles\u2019 dresser for the miscellaneous paraphernalia the pack members leave lying around the Stilinski\u2019s home. And no, they don\u2019t suddenly become a pack right away, the way Stiles\u2019 mother\u2019s stories had once described, because Allison still isn\u2019t ready and Isaac grows quiet and small when Lydia or Jackson come around and Erica still lashes out sometimes. But they\u2019re something, maybe, and it\u2019s awesome. So Stiles has gotten used to having the pack around, underfoot like a bunch of overgrown children. They\u2019re in his house, in his room, sitting at the kitchen table or sprawled over the Stilinski\u2019s couch chatting with his dad. They\u2019ve established the basic ground rules of 1. You must let Stiles know if you\u2019re going to sneak in through his window, and you must get a response confirming he got the message before you try breaking in, and; 2. If you don\u2019t let him know in advance, you have to use the front door or the kitchen door. But still, rules are meant to be broken. Scott lets himself in through Stiles\u2019 window so often that Stiles put a welcome mat under the sill, and Isaac (who is unquestionably his father\u2019s favorite and could easily, shamelessly get away with walking through the kitchen door at any time, day or night) takes great pleasure in using the welcome mat Stiles so thoughtfully provided (\u201cit says wipe your paws, Stiles, who am I to ignore it?\u201d). So he\u2019s not completely, entirely startled when he elbows his bedroom door open and finds a body collapsed on the floor. \u201cDude,\u201d he hisses, slamming the door shut behind him and flipping the light on. The difference is instantaneous, now that he can see for real and not just a silhouette in the dim light from the hallway. The window\u2019s still wide open, blinds tangled like whoever it is hadn\u2019t even bothered to move them out of the way, just crashed right through them. And whoever it is, because even though he\u2019s face down on the floor Stiles can tell it\u2019s not any of the pack members he knows. None of them have that inky dark hair, none of them fill out the shoulders on a leather jacket like that. \u201cDerek Hale,\u201d Stiles murmurs, dropping to his knees next to the alpha\u2019s ribs, fisting his hands in the excess fabric of one of the leather sleeves. \u201cClearly you know how to make an entrance.\u201d He yanks hard, rolling Derek over until he\u2019s mostly flat on his back, one arm sprawled across Stiles\u2019 lap, and the lurking trepidation that had been lingering in Stiles\u2019 gut since he opened the door exploded. Derek\u2019s torso is wrecked, shirt filthy and shredded to the point where it\u2019s nearly indistinguishable from the destroyed skin underneath, both liberally coated with blood and dirt and grime. His face, which Stiles can tell even now is probably a sight to behold on a good day, is littered with bruises and scrapes, a long slash of claws down his jaw, teeth marks on his cheek. He looks like he\u2019d been mauled, and not in the fun way. \u201cShit shit shit,\u201d Stiles rambles, scrambling to get his fingers into his pocket and find his phone. \u201cJesus fuck, don\u2019t you guys have a vet on speed dial, I am definitely not qualified to keep up with this level of violence,\u201d he whines, punching buttons as fast as he can to pull up Scott\u2019s number. \u201cGoddammit.\u201d \u201cStiles?\u201d Scott sounds breathless, almost on the edge of panic. \u201cDude, now\u2019s not really \u2013\u201d \u201cYour Alpha\u2019s bleeding out on my bedroom floor,\u201d Stiles cuts in, glaring down at Derek\u2019s prone form. \u201cLike, badly. Now might not be the best time buddy, but you better make it a good time.\u201d \u201cOh god you found him,\u201d Scott breathes. \u201cGuys, Derek\u2019s at Stiles\u2019.\u201d There\u2019s noise in the background, reactions and questions that, if Stiles was a werewolf, he\u2019d probably be able to make more sense of. They sound relieved though, which Stiles doesn\u2019t get. \u201cScott, did you miss the part where he\u2019s bleeding out on my bedroom floor?\u201d Stiles yells into the phone, even though he knows he doesn\u2019t need to raise his voice for them to hear him. \u201cDude, he\u2019s a werewolf, it\u2019ll heal,\u201d Scott brushes him off. \u201cHe\u2019s unconscious. Still bleeding. He looks like he went through a meat grinder. And it\u2019s definitely not healing fast enough to compensate for the blood loss,\u201d Stiles snarls. The other end of the phone gets abruptly, suddenly silent. \u201cWe\u2019re on the way,\u201d Scott says finally, all relief stripped from his tone. \u201cJust come straight through the window,\u201d Stiles offers. \u201cLydia\u2019s coming with, we need to use the door.\u201d \u201cFine, front door\u2019ll be unlocked. Anything I should do\u2026\u201d Stiles trails off, looking helplessly down at Derek. \u201cAnything you can think of that might stop the bleeding,\u201d Scott says firmly. It\u2019s times like these Stiles can tell Scott holds real authority in the pack, if not as an alpha then most assuredly as his second. The goofy, playful Scott disappears, leaves room for a calm, quiet leader. He drops his phone without hanging up, trusts Scott\u2019ll do it himself, and shoves upright. It\u2019s a small miracle that his dad\u2019s working tonight, pulling a double to cover the night shift of one of the deputies whose wife just had a baby \u2013 it leaves Stiles free to sprint down the stairs and flip open the locks on the front door before bursting into the downstairs bathroom and yanking the first aid kit from under the sink. Back upstairs Derek hasn\u2019t moved, sprawled in the heap he\u2019d landed in when Stiles flipped him over. He doesn\u2019t react to Stiles manhandling him around (as best he can, talk about being heavy as all hell) to pull the leather jacket off, doesn\u2019t so much as flinch at the feel of cold metal against his skin as Stiles cuts clean through the wrecked remains of his shirt. Scott and whoever else he\u2019s bringing must have been close, or maybe they just flew, because Stiles is barely finished wiping a damp towel over the bloody remains of Derek\u2019s stomach when he hears the front door crashing open and the pounding of feet thundering up the stairs. Scott, Isaac, and Lydia burst into his room all at once, and it\u2019s a testament to the lifestyle they apparently lead that not one of them flinches at the sight of Derek spread across the floor, Stiles leaning over him with bloodstains up to his elbows. Isaac falls to his knees by his Alpha\u2019s head, worming one hand gently under his skull to cup the back of his neck, Lydia immediately whips out her cell phone, and Scott crowds over Stiles\u2019 shoulder. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d Scott asks, still using his calm, authoritative voice. \u201cI have no idea,\u201d Stiles tells him hoarsely, swiping up the last bit of blood on Derek\u2019s hip. Though the wounds are still stretched raw and open across his body they seem to have stopped bleeding. \u201cI came upstairs and found him here. Looking at that,\u201d he points to his still-distressed window sill, \u201cI\u2019m guessing he barely made it here before just keeling over and passing out.\u201d Stiles watches the black lines creeping up Isaac\u2019s forearm, leeching Derek\u2019s pain through his veins. It\u2019s not the first time he\u2019s seen Isaac do it but it never ceases to fascinate him, steal his attention. It seems to be working too. Derek lets out a low moan, shifting his head side to side in Isaac\u2019s lap, and the room goes quiet again. Even Lydia seems to be holding her breath, shushing whoever\u2019s on the other end of her phone call. \u201cDerek?\u201d Scott says gently, crouching down next to Stiles. Derek moans again in response, but this time he also manages to blink his eyes halfway open, just enough for Stiles to see a glimmer of red between his lashes. \u201cSc\u2019tt,\u201d he slurs out, twisting his neck to try and find Scott. Stiles leans back, out of the way, and Scott presses forward over him, one hand braced on Stiles\u2019 leg. \u201cYeah, right here,\u201d Scott tells Derek. \u201cWhat happened.\u201d \u201cEthan,\u201d Derek breathes. Each inhale sounds wet, labored \u2013 Stiles broke his ribs once, two summers ago, and one patch of bruising on Derek\u2019s side looks suspiciously familiar like that. Lydia starts talking again, turning away and mumbling so low into her phone that Stiles can barely hear her. Neither of the other two seem to react, not to Derek\u2019s shaky announcement or Stiles\u2019 questioning look. This is the first he\u2019s hearing of anyone named Ethan, and he\u2019s totally not imagining the way Isaac is suddenly avoiding his gaze. \u201cDid he use anything unusual on you?\u201d Lydia raises her voice, twisting back over her shoulder to look down at Derek. He shifts his head just enough to communicate a non-verbal no, and Lydia nods back. \u201cJust teeth and claws then,\u201d she says into her phone, turning back away from them again. \u201cWho won?\u201d Scott asks carefully, ignoring the pointed looking from Isaac. Derek somehow manages to look offended even through his injuries, letting a low growl slip from his lips as the red glare in his eyes flashes a little brighter. \u201cMe,\u201d he grunts, and Scott\u2019s usually bright grin twists into a grim, tense, but no less victorious smile. \u201cGood,\u201d he says firmly. \u201cTwo down,\u201d Isaac adds, glancing over at Lydia. \u201cOnly three left.\u201d \u201cDeaton says there\u2019s nothing we can really do,\u201d Lydia announces, sliding her phone back into her coat pocket and drawing closer again. She peels her plum purple coat from her shoulders and drapes it over Stiles\u2019 desk chair before she settles down on the carpet next to Isaac. \u201cThey\u2019ll take longer than normal to heal, because they were inflicted by an alpha, but since Derek\u2019s an alpha too it won\u2019t kill him. We can wrap them up, at least, so they don\u2019t get any worse, but there\u2019s not much else for it. He should be healed up by tomorrow morning.\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d Scott exhales. \u201cDerek?\u201d They turn back down to look at him, but Derek\u2019s out cold again, even with Isaac\u2019s hand still on his neck. Stiles rolls his eyes, because he\u2019d be willing to bet Derek only forced himself semi-conscious to pass that message along, and apparently stubbornness is a family trait with this pack. \u201cDown for the count,\u201d Stiles mumbles, pointing out the obvious. \u201cWhatever, makes it easier for us to patch him up.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t have to\u2026\u201d Scott starts to say, leaning back again and finally dropping his ass down to the stretch of carpet next to Stiles. \u201cWe can bring him home.\u201d \u201cYou want to move him?\u201d Stiles protests, shaking his head firmly. \u201cNo way, man. He\u2019s barely just stopped bleeding, if you move him now who\u2019s to say it\u2019s not all just going to open up again? No, I\u2019ve got plenty of bandages and shit here, and my dad won\u2019t be back until the morning. Wrap him up, put him in my bed, and let him sleep it off.\u201d Isaac and Scott exchanges long looks, the kind you know are hiding a heavy mess of silent conversation, but it\u2019s Lydia who finally opens her mouth. \u201cStiles is right,\u201d she says. \u201cBesides, Derek\u2019s the one who brought himself here, he should be perfectly fine with spending the night.\u201d No one seems to have a counter argument to that, so they don\u2019t even bother to try. They make quick work and a hell of a mess with Stiles\u2019 first aid kit, and before too long Isaac and Scott are lifting Derek carefully and carrying him over to Stiles\u2019 bed. \u201cMake sure you don\u2019t use hot water on that,\u201d Lydia tells him, nodding down to the large bloodstain where Derek had been laying. Stiles frowns at it as he shoves Derek\u2019s ruined shirt into the trash bag full of bloody cotton swabs, gauze bandage wrappers, and the ruined towel. \u201cHazards of being friends with werewolves,\u201d he says finally, shrugging. \u201cYou learn all sorts of ways to get rid of bloodstains.\u201d He ties the bag off before handing it over to Isaac to be dumped in the trash bin on their way out. \u201cI\u2019ll figure out something, don\u2019t worry.\u201d Scott looks at him like he wants to say more, wants to say anything, but Stiles just shakes his head at him. \u201cSeriously, don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d he says. \u201cUnless, of course, you were about to tell me why it is you guys keep showing up at my house looking like the runty little nerds that just escaped the big bad bullies.\u201d Nobody says anything. Isaac makes a point of looking down at his sneakers, Lydia looks him dead on with the most ice cold expression she can manage, Scott squirms at Stiles\u2019 side. \u201cWe \u2013\u201d Scott says finally, scrubbing one hand through the hair on the back of his head. \u201cYou\u2019re better off not knowing. Safer.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been really, really good about not asking,\u201d Stiles reminds him, ignoring the way Lydia raises an eyebrow in silent disagreement. \u201cBut don\u2019t think I don\u2019t know something\u2019s going on. You guys come here like this is your way of escaping, for a little while, and I\u2019m cool with that. I\u2019m glad you have that, happy to be the one to provide it, but don\u2019t think that means I won\u2019t figure it out eventually.\u201d \u201cWe just want to keep you safe,\u201d Isaac says softly, glancing up with the imploring look that usually works wonders on Stiles\u2019 conviction. \u201cI hang out with werewolves,\u201d Stiles points out. \u201cI\u2019m already straddling the line between best bodyguards in the world and one wrong move away from getting my throat torn out.\u201d \u201cJust trust us,\u201d Scott insists, dropping his hand onto Stiles\u2019 shoulder and squeezing. \u201cWe\u2019re taking care of it.\u201d It\u2019s not over, not by a long shot, but Stiles knows when to let a conversation drop. He ushers the three of them out, promises to text them at the first sign of improvement from Derek, and takes an extra minute to double check the locks on both the front and the kitchen doors. \u201cYour pack underestimates my detective skills,\u201d he tells Derek\u2019s unconscious body when he\u2019s back upstairs, hunched over in his desk chair typing how to remove blood from carpet into the Google search bar. \u201cJust watch me figure this out.\u201d Derek, predictably, says nothing back.\n Stiles wakes up in the morning to an awkward twinge in his lower back from falling asleep slumped over in his desk chair and an empty room.\n It\u2019s three weeks before Stiles hears his bedroom window sliding up, without the customary knock the betas always afford him, and looks up catch sight of Derek Hale\u2019s spiky black mess of hair pushing through the open window. \u201cAt least your puppies knock first,\u201d Stiles snorts, pointedly looking back down at his Economics textbook the second he recognizes Derek\u2019s profile. \u201cHere I thought their alpha raised them to be well-mannered.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a sign,\u201d Derek responds stiffly. Stiles, whose curiosity outweighs even his hardest of grudges (and lets face it, his resentment of Derek for leaving without so much as a passing acknowledgment that he\u2019d been there is fairly low on Stiles\u2019 list of major grievances in life), abandons his chilly fa\u00e7ade of nonchalance in a heartbeat. He jumps right up and all but pushes Derek out of the way in his effort to get to the window, and sure enough when he leans outside there\u2019s a laminated strip of cardstock duct taped to the vinyl siding.DON\u2019T FORGET TO KNOCK Stiles gets cranky when we scare him He laughs openly and loudly, twisting his upper body around to shimmy his cell phone out of his pocket and snap a good picture of the sign, and already has a half-sent mass text consisting of the picture and a row each of HAHAHAs and less-than-threes by the time he pulls himself back into his room. Derek\u2019s standing exactly where Stiles left him wearing the slightly outraged expression of someone who isn\u2019t often kept waiting. \u201cSo you just elected to ignore their advice, then?\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t scare you,\u201d Derek points out, the kind of evasive answer Stiles himself is intimately familiar with offering. \u201cSemantics,\u201d Stiles scoffs back. He only then realizes that neither of them have moved much \u2013 Stiles still braced against his window sill, Derek square on the welcome mat where he landed when he\u2019d climbed inside \u2013 which means there\u2019s barely half a foot of space between him and an alpha werewolf he\u2019s only kind of met once before. \u201cRight,\u201d Stiles clears his throat, ducking around Derek to perch himself on the edge of his dresser instead, solidly halfway across the room. \u201cYou know, I expected you to be more\u2026growly.\u201d Predictably, he actually does get a growl in response to that, a properly wolfy one that comes from low in the back of Derek\u2019s throat, and Stiles would be more impressed if it wasn\u2019t Scott\u2019s primary intimidation tactic during Mario Kart (and hadn\u2019t stopped working on Stiles two months ago). \u201cYeah, whatever,\u201d Stiles waves one hand dismissively. It\u2019s safe enough, here with a good five feet of carpet and the corner of his mattress between them. \u201cThat still doesn\u2019t explain why you\u2019re here, in my bedroom, on my welcome mat.\" Derek directs his glare at the welcome mat in question for a second. The desire to light the thing on fire with the force of his laser-eyes alone is written all over his face, and the heat behind it doesn\u2019t change even when his focus shifts back to Stiles. He looks like he\u2019s bracing himself for something particularly unpleasant. \u201cLydia and Scott say you\u2019re especially good at doing research,\u201d Derek says slowly, evenly, tone so carefully neutral it\u2019s almost mechanical. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve run out of other options.\u201d Stiles jaw drops. Derek reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out a scrap of crumpled loose-leaf paper. Stiles isn\u2019t close enough to reach out and take it from him, but even from here he can see the single shape scratched across the page, all sharp lines and harsh turns spanning out in three directions. \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d Derek shoves his hands back in his pockets. \u201cI need to know anything you can come up with about that symbol. Anything. No matter how irrelevant or inaccurate or unlikely it seems.\u201d \u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019m going to do anything for you?\u201d Stiles challenges. It\u2019s a weak play at best, and Derek doesn\u2019t have to do anything more than turn his gaze down to the stretch of carpet Stiles hadn\u2019t been entirely successful in cleaning the blood stain out of. There\u2019s a lot Stiles has to say in response to that, a dozen questions that include the phrases why, how, and what the fuck, another dozen expletives about Derek\u2019s audacity. Somehow, what comes outside instead is, \u201cdoes it have anything to do with why you\u2019re all getting your asses kicked regularly?\u201d Derek\u2019s eyes narrow, the neutral expression he\u2019d been so carefully maintaining cracking around the edges. There\u2019s the distant sound of warning bells ringing in Stiles\u2019 head, some semblance of his self-preservation instinct finally kicking in, but he pays it little attention. He\u2019s been ignoring his friends\u2019 injuries for weeks and weeks now, since the very first night, and if this is a chance to get answers he\u2019s willing to push it. \u201cAre you going to tell me about all of that, then?\u201d Derek\u2019s eyes flash, just a split second of red, and Stiles knows immediately that was the wrong choice. \u201cNo,\u201d Derek snaps, voice gone cold with harsh authority. \u201cNo. It\u2019s none of your business.\u201d \u201cNone of my \u2013\u201d Stiles gapes at him. Derek had come here to ask him for help, again. If nothing else Derek already made it Stiles\u2019 business. \u201cBut it\u2019s affecting the pack!\u201d \u201cExactly,\u201d Derek sneers back. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not part of it.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cYou have no place in my pack.\u201d Derek stresses each word slowly, tauntingly, deliberate pauses that hammer every syllable home. That cuts the ground right out from under Stiles. He\u2019d been very good about keeping that line drawn in his head \u2013 the betas and Lydia and even Allison were a pack, Stiles knew that, and he knew there was a subtle but huge difference between being friends with the pack and actually being pack. But to hear Derek say it, to have a man he barely knows just throw that right in his face\u2026it made Stiles feel small. And superfluous. And like he was back in Lakeport, alone, and nothing of the last three months meant a damn thing. And that just makes him angry. \u201cYour pack,\u201d Stiles echoes, shoving himself upright off his dresser to square off against Derek. He\u2019s surprised that he hadn\u2019t noticed before that they\u2019re almost the same height, that Stiles might even be the taller one, but he forces himself to tamper down his reaction and just squares his shoulders to look as broad as he can manage. \u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re losing your pack,\u201d he hisses. \u201cThey\u2019re miserable, and they\u2019re here all the time when they\u2019re upset, when they\u2019re hurt, when they don\u2019t feel like they can go home anymore and they don\u2019t feel much like they can go to their alpha either. You know it\u2019s true, you can smell them. They haven\u2019t just been here recently, they\u2019ve been here long enough that their scents are starting to mingle with the general scent of a home \u2013 they\u2019ve all but moved in. So tell me, what the hell do you actually do for them that gives you the right to call them yours?\u201d Derek moves so quickly Stiles hardly sees it: one minute he\u2019s still standing in front of the windowsill, the next he has Stiles flat against his own bedroom door, fingers fisted in the loose material of Stiles\u2019 hoody. \u201cI keep them alive,\u201d Derek growls, pressing so close to hiss the words into Stiles\u2019 face that Stiles can feel the heat of them against his lips. He bares his own teeth in response, a habit he\u2019s picked up from the betas, and forces himself to keep what little ground he has left. \u201cOh yeah, you\u2019re doing a great job of that,\u201d Stiles scoffs. \u201cMy dad thinks I befriended an abused kids support group. They\u2019ve never not bruised and bloody and barely just healing, how exactly is that you keeping them alive?\u201d Derek\u2019s responding snarl is nonverbal, reinforced by the extra press of Derek\u2019s entire body weight shoving Stiles further into the door. Stiles digs his shoulder blades back and plants the balls of his shoulders hard against the wood, determined to hold his ground. The room is so still, silent save aggravated inhales and exhales and the thud of Stiles\u2019 heartbeat in his own ears, that the sound of his dad\u2019s bedroom door swinging open is audible even to Stiles\u2019 human ears. Derek\u2019s grip on his sweatshirt disappears in a single heartbeat, the heat of his body pressed against the length of Stiles\u2019 gone just as quickly. \u201cStiles?\u201d his dad calls through the closed bedroom door, thumping lightly against the wood. \u201cIt\u2019s late, you\u2019re supposed to be in bed.\u201d Stiles closes his eyes, wills his own pulse to calm, forces his breathing into a steady rhythm with a careful count to three. \u201cI\u2019m going right now,\u201d he promises. \u201cJust finishing up an episode of Buffy.\u201d By the time he opens his eyes again Derek is gone. The only sign that he was ever even there is the lone piece of crumpled loose-leaf in the middle of Stiles\u2019 bedroom floor, late-night shadows hitting the sketch at just the right angle to pump an extra shot of fear-based adrenaline through Stiles\u2019 system.\n Stiles didn\u2019t know what to expect from the rest of the pack upon arriving at school the next morning \u2013 didn\u2019t know if Derek would have time to even speak to the rest of them or if maybe he didn\u2019t even need to, if they just instinctively knew now that Stiles had all but been declared Out. What he definitely hadn\u2019t even considered was Scott, Isaac, and Jackson huddled in front of his locker, all wearing the painfully contrite expressions of the recently scolded. \u201cHi,\u201d Isaac says tentatively. He holds out a coffee cup Stiles hadn\u2019t originally noticed, stamped with the familiar logo of a gourmet caf\u00e9 downtown, and Stiles doesn\u2019t have to be a werewolf to smell his favorite blend. \u201cWell that answers the question of whether or not you\u2019ve all heard from your charming Alpha,\u201d Stiles sighs, though he doesn\u2019t hesitate to accept the proffered coffee. \u201cDerek\u2019s a dick,\u201d Scott blurts out instantly. \u201cSeriously, don\u2019t actually listen to anything he has to say, half of it\u2019s posturing alpha bullshit and the other half is wrong.\u201d \u201cAnd how can he say you\u2019re not pack after he showed up injured and expecting you to take care of him?\u201d Isaac cuts in enthusiastically. \u201cTalk about contradicting yourself.\u201d \u201cGuys,\u201d Stiles says fondly. \u201cBut seriously though, Stiles, Derek\u2019s an asshole. And just because he\u2019s the alpha doesn\u2019t mean his word is law.\u201d \u201cAnd he\u2019s really, really bad at saying thank you so getting help from people always makes him prickly and cranky and that\u2019s probably why he \u2013\u201d \u201c\u2013 Was his usually raging asshole self \u2013\u201d \u201cGuys,\u201d Stiles tries again. He glances over at Jackson, who still hasn\u2019t said a word, and Jackson rolls his eyes heavily. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me,\u201d he grumbles, \u201cI\u2019m only here because Isaac needed a ride to the coffee shop.\u201d Stiles doesn\u2019t bother calling him out on the obvious lie, just shifts his attention back to the finally silent Isaac and Scott. \u201cYou guys are ridiculous,\u201d he tells them, but he can\u2019t help the small quirk of his lips. \u201cI got that Derek\u2019s an ass. That was pretty obvious like, six seconds into talking to him.\u201d \u201cWe just wanted to make sure you didn\u2019t think he spoke for us,\u201d Scott mumbles, still looking earnest. \u201cBecause he doesn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cI know he doesn\u2019t,\u201d Stiles assures them. \u201cWe\u2019ve been friends for months without Derek\u2019s involvement, I don\u2019t need his permission now.\u201d Isaac and Jackson look satisfied, but something still doesn\u2019t sit right in Scott\u2019s expression. Stiles knows better than to push him at the wrong moment though, and standing here in front of two of Scott\u2019s packmates doesn\u2019t seem like the right one. \u201cDoes that mean we\u2019re still on for tomorrow night?\u201d Isaac asks nervously, fingers of one hand twisting absently through the wave of curls across his forehead. \u201cOh, now I get this,\u201d Stiles laughs, tilting his coffee towards Isaac. \u201cYou\u2019re just using me for my pizza.\u201d They\u2019d been planning a pack night for that Saturday, the kind of make-your-own-pizzas, cookies-galore, trashy-movies-that-will-eventually-deteriorate-into-a-massive-pile-up-sleepover that most of them had been denied for a large part of their adolescent experience. It was also, as far as Stiles knew, the first time in months the whole pack, betas and humans (even Allison, which Stiles still considered a huge accomplishment), would all be together. \u201cLydia\u2019s been baking,\u201d Jackson interjects finally. Stiles is pretty sure they\u2019ve all been looking forward to it a little more than is strictly normal, even those of them that pretended to be above such things. \u201cLydia never bakes, but she\u2019s been looking up recipes and sending me all over town for organic special ingredients and made really good oatmeal cookies last night. She\u2019ll kill you if you cancel.\u201d \u201cWho said anything about cancelling?\u201d Stiles rolls his eyes. \u201cOf course we\u2019re still on. Your dumb alpha can shove it.\u201d From there it\u2019s pretty easy to nudge Isaac and Jackson gently off to their classes (to nudge Isaac gently off to class; Jackson gets shoved off with a forceful but unheated GTFO). Scott lingers though, like Stiles thought he might, and waits until the other two betas are out of hearing range before opening his mouth again. \u201cYou\u2019re my best friend, you know that right?\u201d It\u2019s not like Stiles had thought otherwise \u2013 he and Scott had become pretty inseparable since that first night in the woods, and even with the gradual inclusion of the other members of the pack into their social network there was still always this core, solid center of Scott and Stiles. It was the kind of friendship that felt like it was years and years old already, one of those timeless, effortless kinds, so yeah, Stiles had been pretty comfortable in assuming that he was Scott\u2019s best friend just as much as Scott was his. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a best friend before,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cMe either,\u201d Scott admits. \u201cBut you definitely are. You have my back no matter how many times I show up at your house with no good explanation, you didn\u2019t even bat an eye at the fact that I\u2019ve recently converted to mythical creaturedom, you accepted my pack like they\u2019re your own. You take care of us and you look out for us and you\u2019re my best friend.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re mine too man,\u201d Stiles tells him. He\u2019s not sure what Scott is trying to emphasize here, and he can tell from Scott\u2019s expression that he realizes it\u2019s not coming across. \u201cNo,\u201d Scott shakes his head. \u201cI mean yes, of course I am. But I mean no, you\u2019re not getting it. Derek told you you\u2019re not pack, and you agreed with us that he was a rude asshole but you didn\u2019t say anything about disagreeing with him.\u201d \u201cScott,\u201d Stiles sighs. \u201cIt\u2019s cool, I\u2019m not offended \u2013\u201d \u201cYou should be,\u201d Scott cuts him off. \u201cBecause you are pack. You are. I know it, Isaac knows it, Jackson knows it, Boyd and Erica know it. Even Lydia and Allison know it. You\u2019re so much pack that Derek\u2019s idea of dragging his near-fatally-wounded ass to safety was to go to your house even though he\u2019d never met you.\u201d And Stiles really doesn\u2019t know what to say. That\u2019s probably the single nicest thing anyone\u2019s ever said to him. Scott, bless him, seems to know that. \u201cI just wanted to make sure we were on the same page,\u201d he says firmly, nudging his shoulder lightly against Stiles\u2019. \u201cSee you at practice.\u201d Stiles watches him go wordlessly, tries to distract himself by finally taking a sip of Isaac\u2019s apology bribe coffee. It\u2019s gone cold by now, but it\u2019s still the best thing Stiles has ever tasted.\n After the display that morning he\u2019s not surprised when Erica slips up next to him in the hallway and practically rubs herself all over him, when Boyd lays a hand on his shoulder before class starts and squeezes lightly. Lydia makes some veiled threat about cookies that falls even flatter than Jackson\u2019s feigned indifference, and Allison joins him and Isaac for lunch. Actually, that last one is kind of a surprise, because he didn\u2019t even know Allison had fourth period lunch. She doesn\u2019t say much, talks quietly to Stiles and says even less to an endearingly understanding Isaac, but it\u2019s still pretty nice. The point is that it\u2019s pretty obvious everyone\u2019s gone out of their way to interact with Stiles today, reinforcing Scott and Isaac\u2019s early-morning insistence that they did not agree with Derek, and he\u2019s grateful for it. There\u2019s still a nagging feeling in his gut though, something unsettled and wrong, which drives him to seek Isaac out as they\u2019re pouring out of the locker room after cross country practice. \u201cHey, I want to talk to Derek.\u201d Isaac looks at him like he\u2019s crazy, or maybe like he\u2019s hoping he didn\u2019t hear Stiles correctly. \u201cWhat? Why?\u201d he asks, frowning aggressively. Stiles can see Scott thirty yards away, blatantly cocking his head towards them and not even making an effort to hide his eavesdropping. Stiles sticks his tongue out at him. \u201cI want to apologize. I was out of line, and I don\u2019t like the idea of causing friction in the pack or whatever, especially between the alpha and his betas, and I\u2019d like the chance to talk to him about it before we\u2019ve had long enough to let it really fester.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good idea,\u201d Isaac says nervously, scraping his teeth across his bottom lip. Stiles is fairly certain it\u2019s Isaac\u2019s fear of confrontation more than his fear of Derek that\u2019s prompting him to say that, but he nods his agreement anyway. \u201cI know. I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea for me to approach an unfriendly werewolf on his own territory without me being invited. So I was thinking maybe you could call him and let him know that I wanted to talk to him, and why, and tell him I\u2019ll be home for the rest of the evening and if he\u2019s willing to talk about it he\u2019s welcome and if he\u2019s not then he doesn\u2019t have to show up.\u201d Isaac still looks skeptical about it, but he promises to call Derek and Stiles trusts his promise. He keeps his window open all night, even for the hour when Boyd and Jackson show up with tightly sealed containers of cookies and strict instructions from Lydia not to so much as touch the lids. He\u2019s maybe a little bit disappointed but he\u2019s not all that surprised when Derek never shows up.\n Make-Your-Own-Pizza Night is going surprisingly well. It\u2019s the first time Stiles has had the entire pack (minus Derek, but he\u2019s never even thought to count him before last week) at his house at the same time, and he\u2019d secretly had some reservations about it. There\u2019s tension in odd places still \u2013 Isaac\u2019s still quiet around Jackson, though he\u2019s better with Lydia now, Erica and Allison stay as far away from each other as possible while still being in the same room. Scott and Allison, too, have that awkward friction between them of failing miserably at remaining platonic with someone you\u2019re in love with, though bless them both for trying. Jackson, apparently without conscious thought, doesn\u2019t give Boyd the time of day, hasn\u2019t noticed Isaac\u2019s routine attempts to blend into the wall around him, and seems to forget sometimes that he\u2019s no longer in a position to push Scott around. So it\u2019s a little awkward. A little tense. There\u2019re moments here and there when Stiles will suck nervously on his teeth, worry at the skin around his thumbnail, glance compulsively in Scott\u2019s direction to see if it\u2019s anything to be concerned about. But for the most part it\u2019s good. He\u2019s watching Isaac and Allison standing at his flour-covered kitchen counter, Isaac working overtime to get a laugh from Allison by suggesting increasingly ridiculous toppings for their pie (he\u2019s not that successful, though he does get a shy but still somewhat brilliant smile), when Scott drops down in the chair next to Stiles\u2019 elbow. \u201cSee what I mean?\u201d Stiles doesn\u2019t need Scott to elaborate; he knows Scott\u2019s referring to yesterday\u2019s insistence that Stiles was just as much a member of this pack as the rest of them were. And here, in the face of Isaac working another, slightly easier smile out of Allison again, the sight of Lydia trying to talk Boyd into a slice of her homemade Hawaiian pie, the sound of Erica teaching Jackson the true meaning of getting your ass kicked by a girl, Xbox edition. Well. Stiles can hear a little voice in his head, the one that sounds like his mother, whispering you did this. You brought them together like this, filed down the rough edges and filled them in. You did this.  It\u2019s hard to deny the truth behind Scott\u2019s declaration, here with the evidence laid out before him. \u201cAdmittedly, you might have a point,\u201d Stiles concedes, downplaying as much as he can. Scott rolls his eyes like he knows exactly how much effort Stiles is putting into sounding nonchalant, leans over to snatch a slice of sausage off Stiles\u2019 own pie in retribution. \u201cAdmit it,\u201d Scott goads around his bite, \u201cyou love us.\u201d \u201cHe loves me most!\u201d Erica calls from the living room. \u201cI baked you cookies,\u201d Lydia butts in pointedly, narrowing her eyes at Stiles as she shifts her attention away from a grateful-looking Boyd. \u201cYeah, but you also like pineapple on your pizza,\u201d Stiles reminds her. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to rethink our whole friendship.\u201d Lydia sniffs delicately, sticking her nose exaggeratedly high in the air as she ignores Boyd\u2019s triumphant look, but the way she settles into the chair on Stiles\u2019 other side and hooks one of her ankles over where his is propped against the table rung softens the sting of the affront. \u201cI think Boyd\u2019s my favorite,\u201d Stiles muses. \u201cHe\u2019s the only one consistently nice to me.\u201d Boyd, looking up from where he\u2019d just beaten Isaac and Allison out for rights to the pizza stone and the oven, nods appreciatively at Stiles. \u201cLiar,\u201d Scott whines, poking Stiles ribs sharply. \u201cLiaaar!\u201d Erica agrees, sing-song voice carrying. \u201cI\u2019m not a witch, I\u2019m your wife,\u201d Stiles and Lydia mumble simultaneously. They blink at each other, pleased surprise evident on both their faces, and miss the arrival of Erica in the kitchen. \u201cHands off my favorite movie,\u201d she tells them, sliding under Boyd\u2019s outstretched arm and leaning back against him. \u201cAnd you\u2019re still a liar. I still think I\u2019m your favorite.\u201d \u201cBased on what?\u201d Stiles challenges, grinning at her. \u201cI\u2019m the prettiest,\u201d Erica scoffs dismissively, like that\u2019s that. \u201cThat\u2019s like saying which of these reds is the reddest red, the apple, the fire truck, or the stop sign,\u201d Stiles argues, gesturing around the room full of models masquerading as high school juniors. \u201cYou\u2019re all supernaturally hot, even Lydia and Allison.\u201d Lydia preens next to him, as if no one\u2019s ever called her attractive before, and Allison shoots him a small smile over her shoulder. Erica still looks playfully insulted though, and Stiles would be concerned if he and Erica hadn\u2019t had an extensively long heart to heart about body image and personal beauty with a healthy amount of mutual confidence boosting less than a week ago. \u201cBesides,\u201d he adds teasingly, \u201cI hate to break it to you but if there was really a competition for Hottest Hottie in the Hale Pack, the obvious winner isn\u2019t even in this room right now.\u201d \u201cNope, I\u2019m right here,\u201d Jackson says from the doorway, striking an admittedly impressive figure posed against the wooden frame. \u201cHe\u2019s talking about Derek,\u201d Lydia rolls her eyes, \u201cnot you pretty-boy.\u201d \u201cDerek\u2019s an asshole,\u201d Scott whines plaintively, giving Stiles his best et tu, Brute? puppy face. \u201cSome people wear asshole really, really well,\u201d Stiles counters. \u201cUnlike Jackson.\u201d Everyone laughs. Even Allison giggles, and Stiles doesn\u2019t miss the way Jackson\u2019s eyes flicker towards her before he rolls his eyes and accepts the abuse from his packmates. Lydia strikes back with something Stiles is starting to recognize as their version of foreplay, Isaac\u2019s tentative attempt at defending Jackson earns him a grateful look from Jackson and banter from Erica in response, and Stiles can feel the last bit of tension in the air dissipating under the sounds of the playful back and forth as the pack waits for Boyd\u2019s, and then Isaac\u2019s and Allison\u2019s pizzas to finish. Stiles and Lydia\u2019s twin moment in the kitchen and Erica\u2019s insistence that she knows every single line by heart prompts The Princess Bride as their first movie choice: an argument about What Qualifies for the Five Best Kisses of All Time (William Shakespeare\u2019s Romeo + Juliet, Captain America, 10 Things I Hate About You, and Deathly Hallows Part II are all considered) and a rousing refusal to let Lydia put on The Notebook begrudgingly inspires Tangled. (Lydia and Allison combine forces; Jackson\u2019s still too whipped to deny Lydia anything, Stiles and Scott both lack the willpower to refuse anything that will make Allison happy). Isaac quietly admits he hasn\u2019t seen a Disney movie since The Lion King, and suddenly six hours and four movies later Stiles is looking around a crowded living room full of tangled limbs and piled bodies in various stages of sleep, and the warmth of belonging and pack and family runs through Stiles\u2019 veins until he can\u2019t help but believe it.\n The third time Derek shows up he doesn\u2019t make it as far as the window. Isaac\u2019s lounging across Stiles\u2019 bed working on his Statistics homework when he sits up so suddenly, so sharply, that Stiles almost falls out of his desk chair. \u201cDude!\u201d he whines accusingly, frowning at Isaac. Isaac ignores him, head cocked toward the window for a few agonizing seconds of Stiles trying to refrain from dog jokes, before he finally shifts his confused gaze to Stiles. \u201cI thought you and Derek were going out of your way to pretend neither of you exists after last time,\u201d Isaac whispers. \u201cWe are,\u201d Stiles shrugs. He doesn\u2019t bother keeping his voice down \u2013 if there\u2019s someone outside they\u2019ll probably hear the whisper just as well as his normal speaking voice. He and Scott tested it one afternoon and when Scott really focused he was able to hear Stiles whispering from fifty yards behind the property line. \u201cThen why\u2019s he outside?\u201d That makes Stiles sit up too, glancing over towards his cracked-open window like he can actually see through the blinds and into the dark backyard below. It\u2019s only been a week since the last time Derek was here, and if Stiles had a single shred of self-respect he wouldn\u2019t have done a single second of the research Derek had been looking for, not after everything he said. He doesn\u2019t. Have a single shred of self-respect, that is. Stiles had pulled an all-nighter the very next night and devoted almost fourteen hours until he\u2019d decided he\u2019d exhausted even his best search efforts (and then spent another four more two days later, just in case). \u201cHe can come up,\u201d Stiles shrugs, aiming for blas\u00e9. Isaac gives him a look that clearly says what kind of drugs are you on. \u201cHe left,\u201d he answers. \u201cSaid he\u2019d come back later. Which\u2026\u201d Isaac glances pointedly at Stiles\u2019 bedside alarm clock, the bright flashing 10:47 PM lighting up the surface. \u201cPlease, you know I won\u2019t be asleep before two,\u201d Stiles scoffs, waving a dismissive hand. Isaac only raises an eyebrow, patiently quiet in that way of his that always gets Stiles to babble out whatever it is Isaac wants to know. This time is no different. \u201cOkay so the reason he was even here the last time was because he was asking me to do some research for him,\u201d Stiles blurts out, because he usually lasts about ten seconds. \u201cSo I guess he\u2019s back here looking for the results of that research or something, I don\u2019t know we got side-tracked from the whole planning effort.\u201d \u201cAnd you did it? Even after he was a raging asshole to you?\u201d \u201cListen,\u201d Stiles defends himself, \u201cdon\u2019t think I don\u2019t notice that you guys are in the middle of some deep shit right now. We\u2019ve talked about this, I will figure it out. But in the mean time, if your alpha shows up in my room asking for something that I think might even a little bit help you guys get out of this alive, I\u2019ll do it. Whatever it is.\u201d Isaac\u2019s face falls into something that is made up of too many different expressions for Stiles to pin just one down, but when he opens his mouth he just sounds quietly sad. \u201cI think keeping you in the dark is stupid,\u201d he tells Stiles. \u201cThe others think they\u2019re protecting you by not telling you. Like we didn\u2019t spend all of last semester learning exactly what a good idea secrets are.\u201d Stiles has learned a lot about what he missed last semester, about Lydia slowly losing her mind in the dark and Jackson being desperately alone, about secret relationships that almost cost Scott his life and secret plans that almost cost Derek his pack. He thinks if they\u2019re keeping whatever this is a secret they must have a really good reason. Either that or a death wish. \u201cIt\u2019ll come out eventually,\u201d he offers, placating, because he\u2019s not going to put Isaac in the position of betraying a direct order from his alpha, not again. \u201cI know,\u201d Isaac agrees, \u201cI\u2019m just worried about where we\u2019ll be when it does.\u201d Stiles doesn\u2019t have a response to that, and Isaac doesn\u2019t seem to expect one. He lets the silence fall back between them again, turning his attention back to his Stats homework and leaves Stiles to his Reddit lurking. The comfortable, easy lull of the evening is gone though, snapped clear through by the unexpected arrival of Derek, and it\u2019s not too long before Isaac\u2019s shoving his things into his backpack. He doesn\u2019t bother closing the window on his way out, and Stiles isn\u2019t surprised when Derek\u2019s stepping over the sill mere minutes later. \u201cYou know,\u201d Stiles says coolly, breaking over a minute of mutually ignoring the other in silence, \u201cthat was a limited, one-time-offer on the apology, not a standing invitation to let yourself into my room whenever you like.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not here for an apology,\u201d Derek grumbles back. He\u2019s not looking at Stiles, eyes back on the bloodstained carpet again like they\u2019re drawn there against his will. \u201cGood,\u201d Stiles insists, \u201cbecause you won\u2019t be getting one. So do us both a favor and don\u2019t let the window close on your tail as you slink back out the way you came.\u201d Derek exhales harshly, almost a growl, but it\u2019s more aggressive posturing than anything else. It\u2019s a sound Erica makes often, Jackson too, and has the odd effect of relaxing a knot of tension in Stiles\u2019 stomach. Stiles pivots his chair until he\u2019s facing Derek head-on, plants his feet on the floor, crosses his arms over his chest, and waits. \u00a0\u201cI need \u2013\u201d Derek grits out finally, and whether it\u2019s the effort of asking for help or the knowledge of how painfully wrong he is it seems to be costing him quite a bit. \u201cDid you look\u2026\u201d Stiles only raises an eyebrow. He\u2019s petty enough to let Derek force it all out, to not make things easy for him. Derek, for his part, seems determined to do so. He lets out another harsh huff of breath, presses his lips together, and tries again. \u201cI know I don\u2019t deserve your help, but is there a chance you looked into the triskele anyway?\u201d And Stiles, because he\u2019s nothing if not an occasional asshole, lets Derek stew in uncomfortable purgatory for several long, drawn out seconds before slowly nodding. Derek exhales like he\u2019d been holding his breath waiting for Stiles\u2019 answer, and Stiles watches his shoulders. They\u2019re so taut with tension, so rigid with the strain of whatever Derek\u2019s carrying, that they barely even move when Derek breathes. \u201cYou definitely didn\u2019t deserve it,\u201d Stiles agrees archly, looking Derek right in the eye. \u201cBut I won\u2019t put the rest of our pack in danger just because you\u2019re an asshole.\u201d Derek bristles, hackles he doesn\u2019t have still almost noticeably raised at the inclusive way Stiles brings in the pack, and Stiles jumps on the opportunity to flash a mocking smirk right back. \u201cStill hurts, then? The way your pack outright defied you, went out of their way to ignore their alpha and make it clear that, in their eyes, I was pack?\u201d He\u2019s playing with fire and he knows it, the look on Derek\u2019s face tells him so, but the self-preservation instinct Stiles can occasionally rely on doesn\u2019t seem to be kicking in. There\u2019s still residual anger from his last interaction with Derek, from the burn of his diplomatic attempts at reconciliation getting pointedly snubbed, and\u2026there\u2019s a certain thrill. The stupid kind of adrenaline rush, the one you get from playing chicken with a car or sitting with your legs dangling off the edge of a water tower, hanging in the precarious balance between safety and disaster. Stiles is challenging a creature that literally thrives on the instinct to shut down challengers with swift and certain violence, and watching Derek\u2019s barely bridled control is beautiful. \u201cThey have no idea what actually makes someone pack,\u201d Derek snarls, hissing the words through teeth just this side of inhumanly sharp. \u201cThey can call you pack until their tongues fall out, it doesn\u2019t make it real.\u201d \u201cThen what are you doing here, again, Alpha Hale?\u201d Stiles braces his hands on the arm of the chair and pushes himself up to his feet to stand in front of Derek again. He\u2019s barefoot, in sweatpants and a long-sleeve henley, shockingly exposed against the armor of Derek\u2019s leather jacket and steel muscle and stubble and sneer. It makes his heart beat a little bit faster. Derek closes his eyes and inhales sharply through his nose, the kind of deep, steadying breath therapists teach to instill a moment of calm, a careful pause to attempt to regroup yourself. When he opens his eyes again his whole face has changed, and not in the wolfish snout and snarling fangs kind of way. He looks exhausted suddenly, the kind of bone-deep weariness that hangs bags under your eyes and hollows your cheekbones into a brittle gauntness. It\u2019s a look Stiles has seen before, that gutted, defeated expression swathed in stubble and stubborn unwillingness to admit to anyone else you\u2019ve lost all hope. Stiles is not a nurturing person. He\u2019s loyal to a fault, and protects the precious few he loves with all the fierceness he can muster, but he has no motherly streak that naturally inclines him towards reaching out to the damned and broken. He takes care of himself, and he takes care of his own in what small ways he can, and he\u2019s normally content with that being enough. But this, he thinks, this is what makes being pack real. Pack is your own, and this pack is his own, and right now the best way for him to take care of his own is to do what he can for Derek. And maybe Derek isn\u2019t his alpha, not yet, but this might just be the way it starts. \u201cLook.\u201d Stiles takes a deep breath, exhales slowly. \u201cI found some stuff, but I haven\u2019t really organized it all yet. Just\u2026sit for like five, ten minutes. I\u2019ll put it together for you.\u201d It\u2019s an hour before Stiles thinks to look up, to pull himself out of the bullet-point summary he\u2019s compiling and remember that he\u2019s not alone. Derek\u2019s fallen asleep in a position that looks hideously uncomfortable, booted feet still planted on the floor, hips twisting his torso so the upper quarter of his body is on its side. He\u2019s still wearing his heavy leather jacket, bunched between the shoulder he seems to be supporting most of his weight on and Stiles\u2019 mattress, and his neck is tilted at an angle that lets him press the bridge of his nose into a pillow without entirely exposing his throat. By now Stiles has come to understand enough about werewolves to know that his room smells as much like home as Derek\u2019s pack can. The betas, the other humans, they spend enough time here that their scents have blended into the fabric of his sheets, the seams of his clothing. He thinks maybe for Derek, more than anyone else, there\u2019s a measure of comfort in that that fills the holes whatever\u2019s hunting them has slowly been leaving. He\u2019s done a lot of research, both on the triskele Derek brought him and on werewolves in general \u2013 he\u2019s got several theories on what\u2019s out there, what\u2019s after them, and none of them are anything less than terrifying. So he hits print on the end of his word doc of notes, bustles around his room until the pages are finished printing, and stacks it all in a neat pile on the welcome mat. Then he says a quick prayer to not have a stomach full of claws in a minute and carefully, cautiously nudges Derek awake. \u201cShoes and leather jackets are not allowed in my bed,\u201d Stiles tells him quietly. Derek hasn\u2019t moved except to blink blearily at him, like he\u2019s not entirely awake, and Stiles takes advantage of that. \u201cI mean it,\u201d he continues, tugging at the lapel of Derek\u2019s jacket. \u201cTake this shit off if you\u2019re going to sleep here.\u201d\n He leaves the room without waiting for a response, takes his time in the bathroom slowly brushing his teeth and contemplating his non-existent facial hair, and holds his breath for reasons he\u2019s not entirely sure about when he opens the door to his room again. Derek\u2019s sock-covered feet are all the way on the bed now, empty boots on the floor with his jacket draped over them, and it looks like it makes all the difference in the world. If he\u2019s not already asleep again then he\u2019s doing a good job of pretending, but either way Stiles has had almost enough of tempting fate tonight. \u201cLast time you got a courtesy get-the-bed-to-yourself card cause you were injured,\u201d Stiles mumbles, climbing into the free space on the other half of his mattress. \u201cBut this is my bed, so pretend we said no homo or whatever helps you sleep better and if you freak out in the morning I\u2019ll get Scott to come break your face.\u201d There\u2019s no response and no freak out in the morning. There\u2019s no Derek in the morning either, but Stiles didn\u2019t really expect there to be anyway, so he\u2019s not all that disappointed about it this time.\n Derek comes back three times in as many weeks. He never makes the mistake of coming by when there\u2019s another pack member around, although Stiles isn\u2019t stupid enough to think they can\u2019t smell their alpha\u2019s scent on his bed, and he never mentions the research Stiles did. He never mentions anything, actually \u2013 they seem to have regressed to a non-verbal relationship that consists of Derek appearing soundlessly at his window, Stiles gesturing wordlessly at his empty bed, and Derek being gone by the time Stiles wakes up in the morning. It\u2019s not nothing. Stiles knows it\u2019s not nothing, isn\u2019t stupid enough to not notice something happening, but he has no idea what. He also has no idea who to ask, how to bring it up, what questions to ask to get the right answers. He doesn\u2019t think much of it when the doorbell rings and he hears his dad greet Allison, direct her upstairs to his room. He\u2019s three episodes into season two of Castle when Allison slips the door open, and there\u2019s nothing out of the ordinary about the way she climbs up on the bed next to him and correctly identifies the killer ten minutes into the episode. Until the credits roll and she shakes her head as he reaches for his laptop to start the next episode. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Stiles frowns at her, twisting his neck to try and get a good look at her face where it\u2019s propped against the ball of his shoulder. Allison moves back obligingly, leaning into the pillows instead of him, but shakes her head. \u201cTalk to me about Derek,\u201d she suggests quietly, blowing everything ordinary and calm about the evening right out of the water with five soft words. \u201cUh,\u201d Stiles blanks, blinking at her. \u201cI\u2026\u201dDon\u2019t even know where to start. He\u2019s completely aware of Allison\u2019s history with Derek, the full circle from meeting him to trying to kill him. He knows about Kate, he knows about Victoria, he knows about Gerard. He knows that whatever Allison\u2019s been doing on her own to work through the lingering issues she has with the other members of the pack haven\u2019t in any way included Derek. He knows Allison would have been the last person he ever would have even considered talking to about him. Hell, his dad would have been higher up on the list. \u201cEveryone\u2019s been trying to figure out how to bring it up,\u201d she shrugs, smiling slightly at his obvious shock. \u201cI thought I\u2019d be the best because the betas can\u2019t be objective about their alpha, even when they want to be.\u201d \u201cCan you be objective about him?\u201d He doesn\u2019t mean it offensively, and from the way Allison\u2019s expression doesn\u2019t change Stiles is confident she understood that. She just looks thoughtful still, like she wants to make sure her answer seems well-considered.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve noticed Derek never throws the first punch,\u201d she says after a moment. \u201cMy aunt killed his family, he ended our truce. My mom tried to kill Scott, he fought her off. Peter killed Derek\u2019s pack, Derek made a new one.\u201d She exhales slowly, closes her eyes. There\u2019s the wet sheen of tears dampening her eyelashes that Stiles doesn\u2019t know the first thing about handling, but Allison only takes another breath and opens her eyes again. \u201cThe Argent family motto is we hunt those who hunt us. Derek follows that mantra better than most of my family ever did \u2013 I may not like him, and I might not ever like him, but I can respect him enough to be objective about whatever you might have to say.\u201d Stiles nods. Allison has a habit of pulling the rug out from under him in the oddest of ways and at the oddest of moments \u2013 he should be used to this by now. \u201cI don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m supposed to say about him,\u201d Stiles admits. \u201cI mean. Obviously the rest of them can smell the fact that he\u2019s been back here again since that first time.\u201d Allison nods her agreement. \u201cI don\u2019t really know why. Or what he\u2019s doing here. He just shows up sometimes, and I don\u2019t turn him away.\u201d \u201cAre you okay with him being here?\u201d Stiles has a lot of feelings about Derek\u2019s continued presence in his room and in his life. A lot of conflicting feelings, mostly. He doesn\u2019t really understand it, and he doesn\u2019t know what it means, and he doesn\u2019t know what it says about him, or Derek, or pack, or anything. But it\u2019s nice, sometimes, having another person in his bed. Nice when he wakes up cold out of a dream of flat-lining heart monitors and brittle fingers falling limp in his grip to the comforting weight of a warm, strong, alive body next to his. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says slowly, nodding. \u201cYeah, I am. I like doing what I can for this pack, and he wouldn\u2019t keep coming here if it wasn\u2019t doing something for him.\u201d \u201cDoes it bother you that you don\u2019t know what that something is?\u201d \u201cNot really?\u201d Stiles sighs, perfectly aware it comes out as much more of a question than a statement. \u201cI mean yeah, okay, it drives the insatiably curious half of me up the fucking wall, but not in the like\u2026I have a problem with it kind of way?\u201d \u201cThat makes sense,\u201d Allison agrees. Stiles snorts. \u201cNo it doesn\u2019t,\u201d he laughs. \u201cNot really,\u201d Allison admits, smiling slightly. \u201cWe don\u2019t really have to talk about it. I\u2019m not trying to force you to talk about it. I just want\u2026\u201d \u201cMe to know I can?\u201d Stiles grins at her, leaning in to nudge his shoulder against hers. \u201cYeah, I know.\u201d \u00a0\u201cGood.\u201d Allison sounds business-like and firm, nodding definitively. \u201cOkay. Wanna watch the next episode? There\u2019s this bit character that looks like an even hotter version of Derek.\u201d \u201cEven hotter?\u201d Stiles scoffs. \u201cYeah right. I\u2019ll believe that when I see it.\u201d (hotter is debatable, but Allison failed to mention Julliard violin-playing musical prot\u00e9g\u00e9, which they both definitely agree is a super plus)\n Stiles doesn\u2019t see Erica all that often in school, usually only in their Economics class and if she seeks him out in the halls, so his initial surprise at sitting her perched on a picnic table by the parking lot distracts him. It\u2019s not until he\u2019s been staring for a few seconds that he notices her usual leather-jacket-tight-skirt combo has been replaced by a soft-looking zip-up and jeans, and even a few seconds more before he notices her left arm cradled against her chest in a makeshift sling. \u201cWhat the hell happened to you?\u201d he sighs, hurrying the last few steps over to Erica\u2019s picnic table. Boyd\u2019s sitting on the bench next to her legs, one arm curled around her hips, and now that Stiles is looking closely he doesn\u2019t look all that great either. His cheek is definitely swollen, and the make up caked heavily over Erica\u2019s face doesn\u2019t fully cover the black bruise under her right eye, and seriously, what the hell? \u201cNoth\u2013\u201d Boyd starts to say. Stiles levels him with a glare so withering that even sturdy, unflappable Boyd falls silent, snapping his mouth shut on the lie. \u201cWe\u2019re fine,\u201d Erica tries, voice uncharacteristically reassuring. \u201cStiles, we\u2019re fine.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t look fine,\u201d Stiles argues, glancing pointedly down at her arm. The fingers she curls around the cuff of the sling move with awkward, stilted motions, like she\u2019s still working on regaining full use of her whole arm, and that is so not fine. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal,\u201d she insists. \u201cIt\u2019s not. It\u2019ll be all healed up by tomorrow, if Boyd and I didn\u2019t have this stupid Pre-Calc test next period I would\u2019ve just stayed home and nobody would have even noticed.\u201d \u201cOkay, but you\u2019d still be hurt,\u201d Stiles points out. \u201cSeriously, you guys are supposed to have all this magical werewolf healing juju, I\u2019ve seen it. What the hell is doing this\u2026to\u2026\u201d He trails off slowly, staring fixatedly at a mark on the side of Boyd\u2019s neck. It\u2019s a long, ragged cut dragging over the curve of his collarbone and down into the collar of his shirt, and it looks not unlike some of the smaller injuries Derek had had the first night he came to Stiles\u2019 house. And then he hears Lydia\u2019s voice, half-distracted as she listens to Dr. Deaton on the other end of the phone line, telling him, Scott, and Isaac that \u201cthey\u2019ll take longer than normal to heal, because they were inflicted by an alpha.\u201d \u201cDid Derek do this to you?\u201d Stiles snarls, eyes snapping up to meet Erica\u2019s. She looks genuinely shocked by the accusation, and it\u2019s reflected in Boyd\u2019s confused expression, but that doesn\u2019t stop Stiles. \u201cWounds inflicted by an alpha take longer to heal,\u201d he reminds them. \u201cLydia told me that. What is this, Derek\u2019s idea of tough love training?\u201d He\u2019s furious. It\u2019s not an emotion he\u2019s particularly familiar with \u2013 fury is an emotion that requires a passionate kind of interest and Stiles hovers more around the apathetic end of the feelings spectrum, but there it is. He\u2019s furious at the very thought that Derek could possibly be doing this to his betas, that Derek could be pushing them so hard against whatever\u2019s threatening them that he\u2019s leaving lasting injuries on them. \u201cNo, Stiles, it\u2019s not \u2013\u201d The bell rings before Erica can finish, which is fine by him. He and Derek are going to have words next time Stiles sees him, and none of Erica\u2019s defenses are going to change that. They\u2019ve been lying to him for months now about who-knows-what and Stiles is going to get some answers. He doesn\u2019t bring it up for the rest of the day. Erica and Boyd are both missing from their classes later in the day and Isaac\u2019s not in lunch, and Stiles knows better than to try and get anything out of Lydia or Allison during class. So he waits until he\u2019s home, sitting in his room mindlessly stumbling through pages of I Waste So Much Time. He\u2019s fairly confident he\u2019ll see Derek tonight, if not because it\u2019s been a few days since he\u2019s slept here then definitely because Erica or Boyd have probably told him about this morning, so he waits. The thud of a boot landing on the roof above his window has him slamming his laptop closed \u2013 by the time Derek\u2019s sliding up the window and slipping inside Stiles is on his feet and ready for him. \u201cYou,\u201d he growls, \u201cbetter start talking. Now.\u201d Erica definitely talked to him. Derek doesn\u2019t seem remotely surprised by Stiles\u2019 unusually aggressive greeting; on the contrary, he seems to have been expecting it. He\u2019s already got his defensive game face on, sneering right back at Stiles, and doesn\u2019t bother taking another step further into the room. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you think I\u2019d hurt my pack,\u201d Derek snarls at him. \u201cYou think I\u2019d do that to Erica, that I \u2013\u201d \u201cOh please,\u201d Stiles rolls his eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t give me that fake bullshit. You kick their asses training all the time, I know you do, they\u2019ve told me. It\u2019s really not a stretch to imagine you pushing it a step too far.\u201d \u201cThey practice fighting each other,\u201d Derek snaps back. \u201cI haven\u2019t \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t \u2013\u201d \u201cBullshit!\u201d Stiles yells. The anger he\u2019s left simmering just under the surface comes flooding back to him, boiling over just enough to keep him going. \u201cIf they hurt each other they heal instantly. It takes an alpha to inflict lasting damage on a werewolf, and let\u2019s be honest, how many alphas are there in Beacon Hills?\u201d Silence. Derek\u2019s angry expression slips for just a second, like his defenses were momentarily disarmed by Stiles, and the wide-eyed look under it screams guilty as fuck. But not about hurting his pack. \u201cDerek,\u201d Stiles breathes, a harsh, sharp inhale-exhale in a desperate attempt to control the rapid-fire thoughts suddenly racing to connect together. \u201cDerek, how many alphas are there in Beacon Hills?\u201d Derek\u2019s starting to look trapped, and Stiles already knows a trapped, cornered Derek gets too defensive to answer his questions. \u201cHow many alphas are there in Beacon Hills? Is there another one? Is there another pack? Is that what\u2019s been after you guys, why you\u2019ve all been fighting? Derek.\u201d \u201cStay out of it, Stiles,\u201d Derek snarls. He\u2019s got a hand already on the still-open window behind him, Stiles knows he can\u2019t move fast enough to stop Derek from leaving all his questions unanswered. \u201cStop sticking your nose where it doesn\u2019t belong. Stay out of this.\u201d He\u2019s gone before Stiles can demand he explain what this is.\n Over a week goes by without a single Derek sighting. Every single one of the betas has sworn up down left and right to him that Derek has never hurt them unnecessarily (the unnecessarily almost sets Stiles off all over again until Erica starts talking about the full moon and jump starting the healing process), but they all get apologetic and silent the second he goes near the subject of another pack. Isaac gets the closest to cracking, silently nodding when Stiles goes off on another rant about how if Derek\u2019s not responsible it has to be another alpha, that\u2019s the best explanation. Scott appears just in time to stop Isaac from actually saying anything helpful though, shooting his friend an unusually stern look. So it\u2019s not like Stiles gives up, or drops the subject, he just learns how and when to pick his battles. And clearly the rest of the pack is united in keeping him in the dark on this one. Fine. He can wait for Derek to crack first. Stiles is strangely confident that Derek will be back, sooner or later, and he\u2019s no stranger to the waiting game. They\u2019re two and a half weeks into complete radio silence when Stiles sits up on his bed, reaching over to pause the episode of Criminal Minds streaming on his laptop, and finally hears his bedroom window sliding open. Isaac and Scott left half an hour ago and none of the rest of them would come over this late without texting him first. Beside, Derek\u2019s the only one who still refuses to knock. He\u2019s sitting completely upright by the time Derek\u2019s inside, and he uses the time Derek spends sliding the window closed to compose himself. Steady breathing, straight face, absolute silence \u2013 he\u2019ll wait as long as it takes for Derek to break. \u201cYes, there\u2019s another pack in town. Trying to take our territory.\u201d Stiles hardly has to wait. Derek sounds gruff, aggressive, not unlike how he has every time he and Stiles have argued so far, but there\u2019s something different about it this time. Something quietly conciliatory, as if his showing up here and voluntarily answering Stiles\u2019 two week old questions is his kind of olive branch. \u201cThey\u2019ve been here since last spring,\u201d he continues. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken out three of the five of them \u2013 the night Erica got her arm broken was the third one.\u201d \u201cAnd the night you came here,\u201d Stiles guesses, because he\u2019s really, really bad at staying quiet when he\u2019s right. \u201cThe first time. You said it was\u2026can a pack have more than one alpha?\u201d Derek just looks at him. It\u2019s not an answer, not really, but it\u2019s enough of one. \u201cAs far as we know, they don\u2019t know about you yet,\u201d he says finally. \u201cAnd the rest of the pack is desperate to keep it that way, so do not fuck this up. You need to stay out of this.\u201d The thing is, Derek\u2019s still using his gruff angry voice, his alpha voice, and he\u2019s still looking aggressive and stern and all serious eyebrows. But somehow this feels like an apology. This is Derek\u2019s backwards, awkward way of apologizing for past douchebaggery, maybe even for going AWOL for the last two and a half weeks. And Stiles is okay with that. (It probably doesn\u2019t hurt that standing in the dim light of Stiles\u2019 over-the-bed reading lamp and looking just a little too wild to be somewhere as domestic as Stiles\u2019 bedroom, Derek Hale is a particular brand of attractive. That particular brand is something along the lines of somebody call 911, shawty fire burning on the dance floor without the horribly insensitive part about saying Derek was hot like burning.) \u201cWhat do you think of Criminal Minds?\u201d If Derek is surprised by the abrupt subject change he doesn\u2019t show it. It takes him barely a heartbeat to recover, just a moment of him slowly pressing his lips together before opening his mouth again. \u201cI like Morgan,\u201d he shrugs. \u201cHe\u2019s a good detective.\u201d \u201cOf course you do,\u201d Stiles sighs, shaking his head. \u201cYou\u2019re both attractive, gruff manly men named Derek who put up this front like you\u2019re assholes but are really super secret marshmallows.\u201d Derek heaves a sigh heavy enough to knock down a small shack (wolf jokes. three little pigs references. Stiles will bust out them all, now that he\u2019s pretty sure Derek won\u2019t murder him) and rolls his eyes with a sassy little twist of his jaw. \u201cYeah, yeah, Big Bad, I\u2019m onto you,\u201d Stiles teases.\u00a0 He pats the bed next to him with one hand, using the other to close out the current episode and switch tabs to the next one already queued up. \u201cCome on. If you solve the case before I do I\u2019ll promise to stay out of your territory war.\u201d Derek successfully identifies four unsubs in a row \u2013 Stiles, in the name of forging tentatively good terms that extend beyond silent midnight sleepovers, doesn\u2019t even accuse him of having already seen the episodes. They fall asleep halfway through an episode about two brothers hunting people instead of animals. And even though they spent most of the night sitting silently and with a firm buffer of no man\u2019s land on the mattress between them, Stiles can\u2019t shake the feeling that something, somewhere over the course of the night, changed.\n He\u2019s right, too. After that night something was different. Easier. Their self-imposed silent agreement grew markedly less silent \u2013 they didn\u2019t turn into gossipy schoolgirls overnight, and they\u2019d probably never have that easy back and forth that Stiles and Scott had right away, but they\u2019d talk sometimes. Stiles would bounce homework ideas off him (and was consistently and pleasantly surprised when Derek would actually shoot back with a well-informed response), Derek would tell him what training exercises he did with the pack that day. They kept watching Criminal Minds. Sometimes Stiles would be waiting for him (he never really knew when Derek was coming, but sometimes he just had a feeling. There were definitely some nights Stiles was wrong and Derek never showed, but somehow Derek had still never managed to take him by surprise), two Snapples and an unopen bag of Tostitos waiting, the next three episodes already buffering before Derek even slides the window up. Some things, realistically, would probably never really change though. Derek, after coming as close as he did to spilling the beans apology-style that one night, has stonewalled Stiles\u2019 every effort to get any more information about the invading pack. He and Stiles argue about it some nights \u2013 never as bad as the first time, never enough for Derek to storm out, for Stiles to tell him to leave \u2013 Stiles lies awake cranky and angry and pointedly staring at the ceiling like he doesn\u2019t notice Derek\u2019s frustrated eyes drilling holes into the side of his head. He doesn\u2019t even dare bring up the subject of what, exactly, Derek\u2019s doing sleeping in his bed two or three nights a week. That one\u2019s actually not as hard though. Not that Stiles isn\u2019t desperately curious about it, or wouldn\u2019t jump on the opportunity the second Derek gave a hint that he might be open to talking about it, but\u2026he was pretty content with the status quo. He didn\u2019t bother questioning his easy friendship with Scott, the brotherly camaraderie he and Isaac coexisted in, the obvious comfort and security the rest of his pack found at his house. None of that made any more sense to him than Derek\u2019s regular appearance did but he never bothered arguing it, so why worry about Derek\u2019s reasons when what they had was just fine?\n Stiles is on his knees on the edge of the mattress, left hand braced on the floor as he stretches as far as he can, fingers scrambling for the closet bit of his computer charger. He\u2019s this close, if he can just scooch his hand a little further out, maybe if he braces one knee against the curved side of the mattress\u2026 His bedroom door swings open, and Stiles has just enough time to catch a brief flash of black on black on black before crashing face-first into the ground in an undignified heap. \u201cOw,\u201d he whines, voice muffled by his carpet. It\u2019s mostly his pride that hurts \u2013 his feet are still up on the bed, knees relatively unscathed, so other than a nice amount of rug burn on his left arm and the way his nose smarts from hitting the floor at a funny angle, he\u2019ll live. Besides, the fingers of his right hand are curled around the end of his charger\u2019s cable, so hey. Small victories. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve managed to survive this long in life,\u201d Derek says dryly. Stiles squirms his arm out from under his ribs, uses his momentum and a hard shove of his feet against his bed to flip himself over. Derek\u2019s leaning against the doorframe, watching with poorly disguised amusement as Stiles settles nonchalantly on the floor, flat on his back with his knees hooked over the top of his mattress. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you used the door,\u201d Stiles shoots back once he\u2019s comfortable. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you even know how to use doors.\u201d \u201cYou left the kitchen door unlocked,\u201d Derek replies, and it sounds all kinds of judge-y and chastising. \u201cWhat if I\u2019d been someone else?\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a baseball bat under my bed and a pack full of werewolves on speed dial on my phone,\u201d Stiles scoffs, waving one hand dismissively. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a pack of werewolves going after members of my pack,\u201d Derek argues, shoving off the doorframe and crossing the room to drop down onto Stiles\u2019 bed. Stiles\u2019 feet bounce lightly off the mattress when Derek settles his weight into it, and if Derek notices that Stiles lets his calf land a little more to the left than it had been a minute before, just enough so that his ankle and foot rest lightly against Derek\u2019s hip, he doesn\u2019t show it. It\u2019s just\u2026Derek said my pack. Derek\u2019s getting cranky because Stiles left the door unlocked while there\u2019s another pack threatening Derek\u2019s pack. So maybe it\u2019s not exactly an engraved invitation of membership into the elite inner circle, and it\u2019s totally not like Stiles even needed the confirmation\u2026but okay, it\u2019s really nice the way it shoots warm little fuzzies all through his chest. \u201cFine,\u201d he rolls his eyes, because no way will he actually let Derek know that. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t lock the door, Dad, I\u2019ll remember to do better in the future.\u201d Derek flicks one finger against the meat of Stiles\u2019 calf. \u201cI mean it,\u201d he says sternly. \u201cStop tempting fate. It\u2019s bad enough you leave your window unlocked.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not locking the window,\u201d Stiles sighs. It\u2019s an argument they\u2019ve had twice already, Derek\u2019s complaints that Stiles\u2019 laziness is going to get him killed. \u201cHow else would you get your weekly Stiles fix?\u201d \u201cBy getting you to get up off your lazy ass for ten seconds to walk across the room and open the window,\u201d Derek gripes back. It\u2019s not an argument either of them is going to win, not any time soon. Derek puts half-assed effort into it at best, which Stiles suspects is because Derek secretly likes having ready access to Stiles\u2019 bedroom, that he doesn\u2019t really want Stiles to lock his window even if it is safer. He\u2019s pretty sure they just argue about it for the sake of arguing now, because when they\u2019re snapping back and forth at each other they don\u2019t have to admit that they\u2019ve slowly been getting less and less snippy and more and more fond of each other. Because you know, god forbid Derek Hale actually get along with someone. \u201cAw, so you really do need a weekly Stiles fix,\u201d he grins, nudging Derek\u2019s hip with his foot. \u201cDon\u2019t think I didn\u2019t notice you ignoring that part.\u201d Derek glowers at him, but it\u2019s all show and no heat. Stiles just beams, the kind of shit-eating grin he reserves specifically for when he\u2019s going out of his way to be a pain in the ass, and Derek rolls his eyes. \u201cCome on,\u201d he grumbles. \u201cYou fell asleep during the first half of a two part episode, I\u2019ve been waiting three days to see the second half.\u201d There\u2019s another burst of warm fuzzies at that, something about Derek admitting he waited for Stiles because Criminal Minds is something they do together, and Stiles covers the way his heart\u2019s melting just a bit by swinging his legs down off the bed and scrambling to get himself upright again. \u201cYou say that like it\u2019s my fault,\u201d he complains, bending down again to gather up his computer charger and his laptop. \u201cLike I wasn\u2019t the one who stayed up until two the night before helping Isaac finish his King Lear essay.\u201d \u201cNot my fault you\u2019re such a nerd that they all try to get you to do their homework for them,\u201d Derek teases. He kicks his boot off and drags himself backwards up the length of the mattress next to where Stiles is propping himself up against his half of the pile of pillows. \u201cWhat an insult,\u201d Stiles smirks, settling his laptop into the space between their legs and pulling up the Chrome window with both halves of the two-parter already loaded. \u201cGee Stiles, you\u2019re too smart. What a dweeb. Also, jacket.\u201d Derek makes a muffled noise of complaint next to him, and Stiles doesn\u2019t have to look to know he\u2019d probably just finished getting good and comfortable. It\u2019s not his fault Derek consistently fails to take his leather jacket off before he gets settled. \u201cI will never understand how you forget to take it off,\u201d Stiles grumbles, leaning out of the way as Derek shrugs out of the sleeves. \u201cIt\u2019s comfortable.\u201d \u201cComfortable,\u201d Stiles scoffs back. \u201cThere\u2019s a big difference between comfortable-yet-stylish clothing options and laying-in-bed-watching-TV-til-you-pass-out comfortable, Hale, and leather falls into the first category.\u201d \u201cMaybe I like leather,\u201d Derek challenges. It\u2019s innocent \u2013 there\u2019s nothing even the slightest bit devious about the way Derek says it, not even the barest hint of lasciviousness in his tone or his voice or his mannerisms \u2013 but suddenly Stiles is struck with a lengthy list of different types of leather products Derek could be into. He drags himself forcibly away from some of the kinkier images that pop into his head (not that the tame is much better \u2013 Derek could be flipping through plain square swatches of leather sample and Stiles would probably still find a way to be turned on by it), forces himself to choke back the panicky laughter threatening to escape him. \u201cWhat,\u201d Derek says flatly, glancing over out of the corner of his eye. Stiles\u2019 shoulders are shaking under his suppressed laughter, and somehow when Derek had settled back from dropping his jacket on the floor he\u2019d landed with his bicep against one of Stiles\u2019 pillows. \u201cJust picturing you,\u201d Stiles forces out quickly, scrambling a lie together as quickly as possible, \u201cbeing forced to sleep on a bed with leather sheets and leather blankets and leather pillows and still stubbornly insisting you\u2019re comfortable.\u201d Well. That was a little\u2026really, Stiles, that was the best you could come up with? You were picturing Derek in an all leather bed? Not to mention that all it takes is a second to actually conjure the image, Derek sprawled across a mattress covered in butter-soft leather, smooth skin warm against the cold material, and oh Christ. Derek doesn\u2019t say anything for a long minute, and Stiles pretends it\u2019s because he\u2019s invested in the scene between Morgan and Reid playing out on screen right now. He\u2019s personally too busy trying to regain control of his heartbeat to focus on the interaction between his two favorites, slowly trying to inch away from Derek with each exhale. It\u2019s another minute before Derek finally reaches over, holding his phone out with the screen tilted towards Stiles. It\u2019s opened to a lengthy blog article advertising the pros of \u201celegant and comfortable\u201d fitted leather bed sheets, satin-lined pillow cases, and a discussion of leather throw blankets versus leather duvet covers. There\u2019s testimony from satisfied customers describing the \u201cluxurious feel\u201d and \u201csupple texture,\u201d and a picture that fit seamlessly into the mental image Stiles is already struggling with. \u201cOh my god,\u201d he chokes out, shoving Derek\u2019s hand away from his face. \u201cI hate you.\u201d Derek smirks at him, and while it\u2019s not really a smile it is his version of a shit-eating grin, and the only thing Stiles really hates about him is that he doesn\u2019t hate anything about him at all. He shoves harder at Derek\u2019s arm anyway, jostling their shoulders together for good measure, and Derek puts up just enough resistance that Stiles really has to work for it. When the dust settles (Derek\u2019s phone safely back in his pocket, both of them sneering faces at each other), they wind up having to rewind the last five minutes of the episode. Derek leans forward to do it, batting away Stiles\u2019 half-assed, useless effort to reach his laptop, and when he falls back again he lands with his shoulder overlapping Stiles\u2019, effectively pinning Stiles\u2019 upper arm between Derek\u2019s arm and his pillows and therefore rendering any further retaliation useless. \u201cJerk,\u201d Stiles grumbles, swatting ineffectively at Derek\u2019s ribs. \u201cBrat,\u201d Derek shoots back mildly, shifting his arm enough that even more of Stiles is covered. And if they stay like that for the rest of the episode, and the one after that, well\u2026whatever. It\u2019s not like they\u2019ve actively avoided tactility before tonight, really, or like the searing heat of Derek pressed down the length of his side is doing ominous things to the regularity of Stiles\u2019 heartbeat. And if Stiles wakes up feeling colder than usual, alone in bed the next morning? Well. It\u2019s winter. Sometimes cold happens.\n Something\u2019s missing. They\u2019re having another pack night, this time at Lydia\u2019s house. Ever since she learned that her wolfsbane punch at her last birthday party had even affected Scott she\u2019d been working on developing a less potent mix, one that might mimic the affect of the alcohol without the hallucinogenic side effects. Jackson\u2019s apparently been the guinea pig up until now, probably because he\u2019d been particularly vocal about how painful the Homecoming Dance was when he was sober, but Lydia\u2019s finally found a formula she wanted to test on a broader scale. It seems to be working \u2013 from where Stiles\u2019 is sitting it looks like everyone is pleasantly buzzed, working their way to a comfortable drunk. Isaac and Allison are huddled over the coffee table, Allison\u2019s shoulders relaxed and her voice light as she tries to teach Isaac to bounce a quarter into a shot glass. Lydia\u2019s got her butt on Jackson\u2019s lap and her feet in Boyd\u2019s, giggling with Erica about something that, based on the looks on both their boyfriends\u2019 faces, Stiles emphatically does not want to know. Scott\u2019s sprawled out on the floor next to him, legs overlapping with Isaac\u2019s under the table and head on Stiles\u2019 thigh. It\u2019s nice. It\u2019s all loose and easy and everything\u2019s a little bit floaty, like letting yourself sink to the bottom of the pool and sitting wrapped in the comfortable weight of the water. Stiles feels warm and content, his body buzzing in a different way than usual, more pleasant, less out of his control. He laughs at something Scott mumbles, ruffles his fingers through his best friend\u2019s dark hair, and grins dopily up at Lydia when she coos and whips out Instagram. But still. Something\u2019s missing. He doesn\u2019t have time to figure out what it is, though. Not now, at least. Isaac\u2019s triumphant cheer at finally sinking his quarter in Allison\u2019s glass catches Lydia\u2019s attention, and as adamant as she is about not wanting to play Quarters she seems to be latching onto the drinking game idea pretty quickly. They settle on Kings, because it\u2019s 85% luck and circumstance instead of dexterous skill (Stiles is more than okay with this \u2013 he\u2019s mean with a ping pong ball and a Solo cup pyramid, but pretty much any other aggressively interactive drinking game is lost on him), and Jackson unearths a deck of playing cards from an end table near the couch. \u00a0 The game, shocking no one, turns ruthless pretty quickly. Well. As ruthless as Kings can get, technically, but still. The standard is set on the third turn in when Isaac pulls a four and the couch collective scramble so fast to get their hands on the floor that Lydia winds up knocking Jackson clear off the end. \u201cGuys,\u201d Stiles laughs, shaking his head at them. Lydia doesn\u2019t even look remotely apologetic, which isn\u2019t new, but Jackson looking completely unruffled is. \u201cIt\u2019s a game.\u201d \u201cAnd there can only be one winner,\u201d Lydia replies archly. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s no winner in Kings,\u201d Scott argues. \u201cI thought the game just ended when the cards ran out.\u201d \u201cAnd that, McCall, is why you\u2019re a loser,\u201d Jackson teases. There\u2019s no heat in it, even something of a friendly smirk on his face, and Scott only rolls his eyes good-naturedly in response. \u201cFine,\u201d he sighs, \u201cbring it on, Whittemore. Show me what you got.\u201d And really, Stiles should have known that was that. His pack was already a mess of highly competitive attention seekers with a ruthless edge that could cut glass, no need to go ahead and issue a drunken challenge to them. Erica and Boyd nearly break a lamp trying to pin each other\u2019s arms down before either of them can raise a hand when Lydia pulls a seven. A jack from Allison leads to a five minute argument about whether Muesli actually counts as cereal that ends only when Allison proposes a redo of the entire round with a new category. The first king, and Isaac\u2019s subsequent rule that you can\u2019t touch your face, has Stiles going through an entire, full cup of punch before the game play even made it one full rotation back to Isaac again. Jackson pulled the first ten, prompting the first argument over the rules as they hashed out how many fingers would be played for Never Have I Ever. They settled on five, because three was too easy and ten took too long, and Jackson low balled one straight at Scott and Isaac right from the get go. \u201cNever have I ever been designated benchwarmer,\u201d he smirks, waving his cup towards them as they both lowered a finger. \u201cNever have I ever driven a Porsche,\u201d Allison says back sweetly, nodding pointedly at Jackson\u2019s hand as he begrudgingly curled his thumb into his palm. \u201cNever have I ever gotten demoted to co-captain,\u201d Isaac adds instantly, grinning at the unimpressed glare Jackson shoots him. \u201cNever have I ever had a personalized license plate with my name on it,\u201d Scott cackles. Normally Stiles would be all for the streamlined attack at Jackson \u2013 the increasingly irritated scowl on his face every time he has to put another finger down is nothing if not hysterical \u2013 but frankly, it\u2019s no fun. Besides, what\u2019s the point in knocking down the same pin over and over again if you could bowl a strike instead? \u201cNever have I ever kissed anyone in this room,\u201d Stiles announces smugly. There\u2019s a frustrated groan rolling through the room as Erica, Boyd, Lydia, Jackson, Allison, and Scott all put one finger down. Only Isaac doesn\u2019t move, waggling all five fingers teasingly at Stiles. \u201cNice try,\u201d he laughs, grinning. \u201cOh yeah?\u201d Stiles shoots back. He braces the hand holding his drink against the floor and launches himself across Scott\u2019s lap, grabbing Isaac\u2019s jaw just in time to plant a loud, smacking kiss right on Isaac\u2019s lips. It\u2019s all dramatic noise and affect and very little actual kiss, but it\u2019s still enough to send everyone else into hysterics as Isaac shoves Stiles\u2019 face forcibly away, making a show of wiping aggressively at his own mouth with his free hand. \u201cThat was gross,\u201d Isaac whines, chugging down a gulp of punch like he\u2019s trying to wash a bad taste out of his mouth. His eyes are bright under his curls though, the corners of his lips turned up from the grin he\u2019s trying hard to reign in. \u201cI just didn\u2019t want you to feel left out,\u201d Stiles teases. \u201cBesides, now no one can use that one against you.\u201d Isaac just rolls his eyes and reaches over Scott to shove playfully at Stiles\u2019 shoulder, but it does the job. The rough tension of ganging up on Jackson is broken, and Erica\u2019s statement is broad enough that Lydia, Scott, and Stiles all put a finger down. Jackson still loses, hard not to when he\u2019s only got one finger up while everyone else still has three or four, but it\u2019s funnier now, less aggressive. It doesn\u2019t hurt that the statement he loses on is Allison\u2019s genuinely innocent \u201cnever have I ever \u2018practiced\u2019 by kissing my best friend.\u201d The tension might be broken, but the competitiveness certainly isn\u2019t. Jackson makes a big show of magnanimously taking a generous sip of his drink, immediately calls Stiles out for scratching his nose, and is the first one to slap his hand to the ground when Allison flips over another four. But still, it\u2019s fun. The aggression is tempered with the still easy buzz of alcohol and laced with the open, raucous laughter when they start to skirt the edges of ridiculous. There\u2019s a category round of different sex positions that makes three full rotations around the circle before Scott blanks out on one, a rhyme that turns into a quasi rap that leaves Stiles and Erica cackling, and another king rule of \u201cno names,\u201d that sparks a slew of makeshift, borderline offensive (mostly just funny) spur of the moment nicknames for the whole pack. Questions is Stiles\u2019 favorite though, so when Boyd flips a queen he puts his game face on and doesn\u2019t hesitate in looking up to meet Boyd\u2019s eyes. They volley questions back and forth around the group, Boyd to Stiles to Jackson to Isaac to Erica to Scott, until Lydia and Stiles find themselves in a hot potato battle, blurting out rapid fire questions back and forth to each other, ignoring everyone else in favor of tripping up the other. \u201cHow much do you weigh?\u201d he throws at her, gunning for indignation to slow her down. She doesn\u2019t even blink. \u201cHow many times a day do you jerk off?\u201d \u201cIs that dress last season?\u201d \u201cCan you quote an entire scene from Mean Girls?\u201d \u201cDo you identify with Regina George?\u201d \u201cHave you ever felt personally victimized by me?\u201d \u201cWould you mind if I hit you with a bus?\u201d \u201cWhen Derek sleeps over do you two fuck?\u201d Stiles falls back on his butt with a dull thump against the carpet, jaw dropping open. Lydia\u2019s eyes are wide, hovering somewhere between triumph and regret, and everyone else is looking at him like they\u2019re waiting for his cue. Stiles just bursts out laughing. \u201cHoly shit,\u201d he breathes, choking the words out through giggles as he curls his arms over his stomach. \u201cOh my god, Lyds, I\u2019m not even upset I lost.\u201d \u201cAs if you ever had a chance of winning,\u201d she sniffs delicately. The rest of them are laughing now too, still somewhat tentative but definitely not nearly as nervous as they\u2019d been a moment before. It makes him laugh even harder, really, because honestly. \u201cSeriously though, no,\u201d he says finally, only after taking his justly deserved sip of punch. \u201cAs if.\u201d Erica rolls her eyes at him, ignoring the look Boyd tries to give her, and takes her own sip she earned from being paired up as Stiles\u2019 date when he\u2019d pulled an eight two rounds ago. \u201cPretty sure if Derek was getting laid on the regular he wouldn\u2019t be such a tight ass,\u201d she quips. \u201cOr at the very least be able to dislodge that stick rammed up there.\u201d \u201cCan we not talk about Derek\u2019s ass,\u201d Jackson grumbles. \u201cBut it\u2019s such a nice ass,\u201d Lydia sighs, exchanging knowing grins with Erica. Ordinarily Stiles would be the first one to chime in his agreement there (what, he\u2019s spent enough time watching that ass climb out his window to appreciate its worth), but he\u2019s let the conversation slip away from him. Lydia\u2019s question hadn\u2019t really bothered him, nothing about breaking the de facto rule to ignore Derek and Stiles\u2019 whatever thing or her alluding to anything happening between them really phased him, but it did get him thinking. Because that was it. That\u2019s what was missing tonight, here in the Martin\u2019s living room with all his favorite people, curled up on a rug with his best friends, taking a moment to ignore the supernatural and the weird and the wild and worry about being seventeen and stupid. Derek was missing, was keeping this night from really, truly feeling like a moment with his pack, and now that Stiles finally noticed it his absence was gaping. The game continues (nobody wins, Erica flips the final card over to reveal a very anticlimactic three). Jackson starts rattling off a list of other card games they can play, most of which go right over Stiles\u2019 head. He\u2019s content to just let Jackson deal, answering with a suit, a color, or \u201chigher/lower\u201d when prompted, drinking when told. It\u2019s just that he\u2019s distracted now. Distracted by the lack of Derek, distracted by how much it bothers him, that Derek\u2019s not there. Derek should be there, should be bonding with his pack, should be teaching Lydia how to find the loopholes in werewolf-enhanced metabolism and healing, should be showing them drinking games he learned from his older siblings\u2019 friends and his time on the east coast. But what\u2019s really distracting Stiles is how much he wants Derek there for him. Personally. He wants Derek sitting next to him on the floor, rolling his eyes at Scott\u2019s dopey grin and flicking Stiles\u2019 ear when he makes a dog joke. He wants Derek sprawled in the oversized arm chair behind Stiles\u2019, knees spread with his legs bracketing Stiles when Stiles leans back against the chair. When they go to sleep they don\u2019t pair off \u2013 nobody wants to have any kind of sex in a house full of friends with advanced hearing, and everyone knows part of the fun of sleepovers is all piling into the same room together. They shove Lydia\u2019s basement furniture together like puzzle pieces, using the L-shaped couch, two enormous ottomans, and a chaise lounge to make a makeshift bed large enough for eight of them. But still, there\u2019s an obvious grouping together \u2013 Jackson curls protectively around Lydia, who always insists on having him at her back and Boyd in front of her. Erica drapes herself diagonally, head and shoulders on Boyd\u2019s broad chest, legs tangled with Isaac\u2019s. Isaac, Allison, Scott, and Stiles sleep in a delicately careful arrangement of limbs designed entirely around pretending that Allison and Scott won\u2019t end up wrapped together by the end of the night. Normally Stiles doesn\u2019t mind it \u2013 he likes the comfortable tangle of warm bodies around him, of not being sure if it\u2019s Erica\u2019s toes or Isaac\u2019s buried under his shin, of Scott\u2019s head on the other half of his pillow and Allison\u2019s face pressed into his bicep. Tonight, though, hanging on the frayed edges of the gaping hole where Derek should be, it just pisses Stiles off. Pisses him off and makes him want, because for the first time he\u2019s drunk enough to admit to himself that he doesn\u2019t just want Derek laying in the other half of his bed, carefully spaced out next to him. He wants Derek here with him right now, pressed against his back with an arm over Stiles\u2019 hips and a leg between Stiles\u2019 thighs. He wants to use Derek\u2019s enormous bicep as a pillow, to be able to turn his face into the bare skin and smell leather and crisp leaves and laundry detergent. He wants Allison to feel safe with her back against Derek\u2019s back and Scott against her front, and to wake up at the crack of dawn with a mouthful of Isaac\u2019s curls because Isaac\u2019s got his face in the crook of Derek\u2019s elbow, curled into his alpha in his sleep. He wants to feel Derek\u2019s disgruntled huff against the skin of his neck when Stiles fails to stifle a fond laugh, wants the warning scrape of teeth against the shell of his ear when Derek complains that it\u2019s too early, Stiles, go back to sleep. He wants to sink further back into the warmth of Derek\u2019s chest and agree to another few hours of pretending the sun\u2019s not up yet. He wants to wake up later to the sleepy, lazy mess of his hungover best friends, his family, his pack, and have Derek still be there next to him. Stiles squirms his way out of their nest of blankets and pillows carefully, worming his way out from under Scott\u2019s arm and shoving the blanket he\u2019d been using under Allison\u2019s foot to replace the calf he moved away. Once he\u2019s upright he counts to five, waiting to see if anybody noticed him move, before creeping as quietly as possible across the basement and skirting the very edges of the carpeted stairs as he climbs back up to the kitchen. And promptly almost falls ass backwards down the whole damn flight of them when he catches sight of dull red eyes reflecting back at him from the other side of the French patio doors. \u201cJesus holy shit fuck fuck,\u201d Stiles hisses, fingers scrambling against the doorframe leading to the basement stairs. There\u2019s a light switch next to his hand, one of which Stiles hopes to god works the patio lights, and sure enough the far left one flips an overhead porch light that throws Derek into sharp relief. \u201cOh my god,\u201d Stiles mumbles, throwing the lock open and opening the back door just wide enough to slip outside before closing it behind him. \u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you?\u201d \u201cWhat are you doing out here?\u201d Derek grumbles back. He\u2019s got his arms crossed over his chest in a way that\u2019s more defensive than anything else, hands curled around his ribs instead of fisted against his biceps, and he\u2019s damp all over from the rain Stiles hadn\u2019t realized was still falling. Stiles wants to reach out and touch him, to run his hand across Derek\u2019s wet, tense shoulders and coax him inside. He shoves his hands into his hoody pockets instead, leveling his most unimpressed look on Derek. Stiles is still kind of drunk though, hair mussed from his pillow and eyes dulled by the late hour, so he\u2019s not sure it has any effect whatsoever. \u201cWhat am I doing out here?\u201d he repeats, frowning. \u201cGetting my drunk ass a glass of water after failing to out-drink a pack of werewolves. What\u2019s your excuse?\u201d Derek looks shifty, fixing his eyes on a point somewhere to Stiles\u2019 left. \u201cI was making rounds,\u201d he says gruffly. \u201cI knew you were all here, I just wanted to check before heading home.\u201d \u201cCheck\u2026that we were safe?\u201d Stiles guesses quietly. Derek doesn\u2019t look at him. Realistically, Stiles has no idea how much danger they\u2019re actually in. He\u2019s very aware that the pack is still regularly getting hurt, though they are working harder to hide it from him, and he\u2019s definitely aware that Derek\u2019s in way over his head. He still doesn\u2019t know anything though, not nearly enough to gauge the situation, so he doesn\u2019t know if Derek\u2019s appearance here is genuine, justified concern for his pack\u2019s safety or if it\u2019s something else. He gets this momentarily little flash of Derek, sitting outside the Martin\u2019s house knowing his whole pack\u2019s inside, together and happy and alive, and knowing that they don\u2019t even realize he\u2019s there. That they\u2019re so dissociated from their alpha that they don\u2019t miss him, don\u2019t want him inside with them. Stiles really, really hopes Derek really was just doing a patrol through the neighborhood. \u201cWe\u2019re good,\u201d he tells him. \u201cEveryone\u2019s inside, in the basement. They\u2019re all asleep. Or at least, they were five minutes ago.\u201d \u201cGood,\u201d Derek nods. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d He turns, and in the light his eyes aren\u2019t red anymore, just slightly breathtaking as they catch Stiles\u2019 stare. It\u2019s the first time Stiles has ever seen Derek outside of his bedroom, he\u2019s just realized, and something about this just looks all wrong. He\u2019s always thought seeing Derek outside would be something \u2013 that Derek outdoors would be in his element. Maybe Derek in the woods is, or Derek in an open warehouse, in the industrial zone downtown, down the length of a dark country road. Here in the Lydia\u2019s backyard, face cut in sharp angles and shadows from the unforgiving porch light, hair gone flat from the rain, he just looks tired and small. \u201cDo you want to come in?\u201d Stiles blurts out instead of answering Derek\u2019s question. Derek blinks at him, like he\u2019s not sure what Stiles is really asking, and Stiles just shrugs. \u201cI just\u2026I mean, it\u2019s raining. And December. And you\u2019re soaked, and it\u2019s late, and considering you\u2019re in the backyard and not out front I\u2019m pretty sure you ran here instead of driving, so\u2026\u201d he trails off awkwardly, fingering the cuffs of his sweatshirt. \u201cI still have a few more stops to make,\u201d Derek shakes his head. Stiles frowns at that \u2013 he\u2019s hazy and not entirely one hundred percent right now, but he\u2019s reasonably sure Derek had just told him he was stopping here on his way back home. \u201cBesides, my loft\u2019s not that far from here.\u201d \u201cOh, yeah,\u201d Stiles nods. He doesn\u2019t call Derek on the lie, no matter how badly he wants to. \u201cI should let you go do that then.\u201d Derek\u2019s still looking at him though, something unidentifiably in his searching expression. He looks like maybe he\u2019s trying to understand Stiles, like Stiles is the enigma here. \u201cYeah,\u201d Derek nods finally. He drops his arms back down to his sides, gestures towards the Martins\u2019 back door. Stiles has no doubt Derek\u2019s going to stand here and watch him until he\u2019s safely back inside, door locked behind him, no matter what Stiles says. \u201cOkay,\u201d Stiles nods back. He doesn\u2019t turn to look when he\u2019s reaching for the door handle, fumbles for it behind him. Not until Derek\u2019s eyes flick over his shoulder, anyway, and fix on something in the kitchen behind him. It\u2019s Lydia, sitting on the island counter in the middle of the room with an expectant look on her face, and Stiles nods again before turning back to Derek. \u201cGet home safe,\u201d he says quietly. He doesn\u2019t wait for Derek\u2019s response, turns his back to him and slips through the door again. By the time he turns around to lock it and drag the lace curtains in front of the doorway Derek is gone, nothing more than a blur of black slipping through the back gate. Lydia\u2019s still watching him when he turns around again, perched on the countertop with her arms around her legs and her chin on her knees, and Stiles doesn\u2019t bother hiding anything from her. He crosses the kitchen and slumps down next to her, bracing his forearms against the counter and dropping his forehead down against the outside of her knee. She frees one arm from between them and reaches her fingers up into his hair, threading softly through the dark strands. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d she asks quietly. Stiles shakes his head against her knee, careful not to dislodge her hand. \u201cIs it because of what I said earlier?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d he promises. \u201cNot really. I mean, you didn\u2019t bring up anything I hadn\u2019t already thought about.\u201d \u201cYou wanna talk about it?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d Stiles says again. He wants to sober up enough that he can go back to lying to himself, wants to drink enough that he blacks tonight out and earns a one way ticket back to denial. He knows better than to think either of those are options though, and goddammit why can\u2019t he ever be one of those obnoxious shit teenagers with a delusional understanding of reality? \u201cYou wanna go upstairs and lay in my bed make fun of whatever stupid late night movie is on Lifetime until we both pass out?\u201d Stiles lifts his head up, considering. Yeah, actually, weirdly enough that sounds exactly like what he wants to do right now. Lydia seems to know it too; she doesn\u2019t wait for his response before hopping down off the counter, nudging him along with her as she makes her way out of the kitchen. Stiles waits until they\u2019re both curled up under her duvet and in the middle of a commercial break twenty minutes into one of their Lifetime Original Murder Mystery Empowering Things movies to bring up the only question he actually wants to talk about. \u201cHave you ever been to Derek\u2019s loft?\u201d \u201cOnce,\u201d Lydia nods sleepily. \u201cIt\u2019s downtown, by the water.\u201d \u201cHow far would you say it is from here?\u201d \u201cBy car? Half an hour,\u201d she shrugs. \u201cFor a werewolf on foot maybe an hour? I think Jackson\u2019s run it before.\u201d An hour. Not that that\u2019s a surprise, really, Stiles had been perfectly aware that Derek was lying to him. But still, he\u2019d opted to run home in the dark and the rain and the cold for an hour rather than stay at Lydia\u2019s house with the rest of the pack. \u201cI\u2019m sure he made it home fine,\u201d Lydia adds quietly, trying to read into Stiles\u2019 silence. \u201cYeah,\u201d he agrees, curling the edge of the comforter up over his shoulder and tucking it under his chin. \u201cOf course he did.\u201d\n It\u2019s been a few days since he\u2019s heard from Derek, so it doesn't really surprise him when his window slides open Tuesday night, late enough for the cover of darkness but still reasonably early. Stiles, ever incapable of focusing his attention on one single thing at a time, is lounging on his bed with a book on his stomach, his laptop on his thighs, and a phone in his hand.\n\"Werewolf business or personal pleasure?\" he quips, not looking up from where he's composing a text to Lydia. Derek doesn't answer, which really actually is an answer in his own weirdly non-verbal way.\n\"Pick a book,\" Stiles waves a hand at the bookshelf against the far wall, \"we're having quiet reading time.\"\nDerek doesn't need to be told twice. Stiles hears the quiet thuds of his shoes being kicked off under the windowsill, the creak of his desk chair as Derek tosses his jacket over the back of it. A minute later he climbs over Stiles' feet, seemingly undisturbed by the way Stiles has taken over the side of the bed that's usually unofficially Derek's.\nHe settles with his back to Stiles, on his side, with his head propped up on one arm and a book in his free hand.\nTime passes easily between them. A steady playlist of soft indie rock streaming from Stiles' computer and the occasional buzz of an incoming text are the only interruptions to the companionable quiet, and Stiles finds himself drifting. Not sleeping, he's still steadily pushing through The Maze Runner, but lulled into that calm place where the words flow effortlessly over him. Derek's a solid wall of warmth against his side, steady and stable and safe, and the pillow under his head is cool and soft.\nIt's nice. Easy. Comfortable. Comfortable, like pack, like family. He likes this, sitting here with Derek, peaceful and calm and a little bit less alone.\nWhen Derek rolls over two hours later, tossing his finished book on Stiles' stomach and wearing the most petulant frown Stiles had ever imagined a twenty-five year old werewolf capable of, Stiles just grins at him, slow and lazy and amused.\n\"There's four more where that came from,\" he offers, pointing towards the shelf where the The Sea of Monsters, The Titan's Curse, The Battle of the Labyrinth, and The Last Olympian sit. \"More in a new series too, but that one's not finished yet so I actively suggest you save yourself the heartache.\"\n\"This book is for twelve year olds,\" Derek protests, glaring at The Lightning Thief like he hadn't just devoured it in under two hours.\n\"I was ten when the first one came out,\" Stiles points out, because true, and also because you don't need to be a teenager to enjoy teen lit. \"Besides, they kind of work like the Harry Potter books, the writing gets...well okay, not more sophisticated but...less sophomoric as Percy gets older. He's sixteen in the last book.\"\n\"I'm over being surrounded by sixteen-year-olds,\" Derek grumbles, even as he scoops the paperback off Stiles' stomach and gets up to re-shelve it. His fingers linger over the tan binding of The Sea of Monsters.\n\"That was sooo last year,\" Stiles agrees, smirking. \"Thank god everyone\u2019s super mature adults now.\"\n\"Adults,\" Derek repeats flatly, settling back down onto the mattress with the new book in hand. \"The world weeps at the idea of you being an adult.\"\n\"Rude,\" Stiles gripes good-naturedly. \"Just for that I'm going to make sure Erica finds out you spent the night lounging on my bed reading Percy Jackson after you specifically told her she couldn\u2019t come over.\u201d\nDerek gives him his flat, Derek Hale is tired of your bullshit face...which had entirely lost its power about ten seconds after Stiles noticed the striking resemblance between that face and that grumpy cat meme. Stiles only grins at him, cheeky and smug and too content to care about anything else, before pointedly returning to his own book.\nThis time when Derek opens The Sea of Monsters he stays facing Stiles, propping the book against Stiles' side. Stiles can feel fingertips brushing his ribs with every page turn, the warm exhale of Derek's breath against his shoulder, and it's still just really, really nice.\nIt isn't until Stiles blinks his eyes open to the sight of Derek's face much closer than he'd expected does he realize they'd both fallen asleep. Stiles must have shifted onto his side, towards Derek - they were face to face, The Sea of Monsters pressed against Stiles' stomach and bookmarked by Derek's thumb, the laptop on an angle on the mattress, bracketed between Derek's and Stiles' thighs.\n\"Hey,\" he mumbles, reaching out to nudge Derek lightly. \"Wake up.\"\nDerek ignores him. Stiles knows he's being ignored, that Derek's not still asleep, because the asshole snuggles down further into the mattress, wedging his face deeper into the space between his arm and the blanket.\n\"Come on,\" Stiles prods, shifting back enough that he can work his own arm out from under him and gather up their abandoned books, closing them together to bookmark each other's pages. \"Derek, just get up for like ten seconds.\"\n\"No,\" Derek grumbles.\nStiles reaches down for his laptop and lowers it carefully to the floor before he begins kicking at the blankets, squirming around until he can get his legs under them.\n\"Nobody wants to sleep in jeans,\" Stiles insists, because frankly he\u2019s comfortable as hell and he\u2019s kind of toying with the idea of \u2018accidentally\u2019 rolling over in the middle of the night and pushing into Derek\u2019s space. \"Take them off, get under the covers, I'll let you sleep. Promise.\"\nDerek moves slowly. Sooo slowly. Stiles silently hopes there\u2019s never a supernatural crisis that requires waking Derek up for immediate action, because Stiles is pretty sure they'd all die. He shimmies out of his jeans without lifting the upper half of his body off the mattress, all wriggling hips and strong thighs that Stiles pointedly does not look at, and tosses the jeans over Stiles and down onto the floor.\n\"Was that really so awful?\" Stiles teases, tugging the blankets up the rest of the way, enough to cover them both.\n\"Yes,\" Derek complains, hitching the sheets up over his shoulder, \"now shut up.\"\n\"Yeah yeah,\" Stiles bitches back, \"goodnight to you too.\"\nDerek's already out cold.\n Stiles wakes up and doesn\u2019t even need to open his eyes to know something is wrong. There\u2019s a pounding in his head and dirt on his face and an ache in his wrists. Which are chained up stretched high over his head so, yeah, something is definitely w-r-o-n-g wrong. He keeps his eyes closed as he tries to catalogue everything he feels first. It\u2019s a surprisingly difficult task with the way his brain is throbbing in his skull, pressure from an origin point on his temple pressing too sharply into his head. There was a \u2013 something, he\u2019s not sure what \u2013 but he remembers stepping out the garage door to bring the garbage out, and then he remembers an explosion off the side of his face and then nothing. But okay. Stiles\u2019 arms, for a start, are stretched taut over his head, shoulders framing his ears, wrists wrapped in cold metal handcuffs snapped tight around his skin. He\u2019s hanging from something \u2013 the chain holding the cuffs together, it feels like \u2013 and whoever strung him up did it at just the right height for him to be uncomfortable. When he stands at his absolute fullest height, legs and arms straight, spine a long line, shoulders hunched, he can just barely brace most of his weight against the floor on the balls of his feet. He\u2019s not alone. That awareness creeps in slowly. He\u2019s straining to hear any kind of identifiable noise \u2013 traffic from the interstate maybe, running water, aircraft, anything \u2013 and what he hears instead is slow, calm breathing, the light tap of fingernails against a hard surface, the telltale squeal of leather rubbing against leather. He forces himself to breathe again, to count each inhale\u20261\u20262\u20263\u2026exhale\u20261\u20262\u20263\u2026 until his heartbeat has returned to something that feels relatively normal. Stiles isn\u2019t stupid enough to think whoever\u2019s in the room with him is human, meaning they probably already know that he\u2019s 1. awake and 2. aware that he\u2019s not alone, but he doesn\u2019t care. Fake it til you make it\u2019s been a motto he\u2019s lived by for years already, he\u2019s not about to abandon that now just because of a little kidnap. So when he opens his eyes he doesn\u2019t waste any time looking frantically around \u2013 he goes straight for where he thinks he\u2019ll find the werewolf holding him captive. She\u2019s sitting cross-legged in a chair at the center of the room, elbows on her knees as she focuses on cleaning grit out from under the claws on her left hand. It\u2019s a stupidly dramatic intimidation tactic that\u2019s been used in more movies and TV shows than Stiles could count \u2013 Stiles genuinely hopes that she really is cleaning her nails, killing time waiting for him to wake up. Because frankly, he\u2019d expected more out of this pack that had been running his ragged these last few months. \u201cHe\u2019s awake,\u201d she says finally. She\u2019s still not looking at him, dark hair hanging down over her face as she works at a particularly stubborn spot under her pinky nail, and she doesn\u2019t raise her voice higher than a regular conversational tone. So there\u2019s a second werewolf nearby, then. One that this one defers to, at least enough that she\u2019s being forced into baby-sitting duty while the other one left the room. Stiles takes advantage of her feigned disinterest to search his memory for anything Derek or the others have mentioned, in passing or otherwise, about the invading pack. Only three left, Isaac had said once, the night Derek first showed up in Stiles\u2019 bedroom. And then later, after Stiles had accused Derek of hurting Erica, he\u2019d said they\u2019d taken out the third of the five. There are only two of them. Okay. This one, the woman in the room with him, and whoever she\u2019s waiting for. Almost on cue the door opens at the far end of the wall, the contrast between the dimly lit room Stiles is in and the bright lights in the outer room enough that he can only see a silhouette. It\u2019s a man, that much he thinks he\u2019s sure on, and as he steps into the room with precise, confident steps Stiles can slowly start to see more. There\u2019s the cut of a collar against his throat and the unnaturally smooth shape of shoulders that suggest a suit, a shadow across his face that might be glasses. Heels click against the concrete with each footfall \u2013 not the sharp snap of stilettos but the heavy thunk of boots or thick-souled dress shoes. He stops next to the woman\u2019s chair, drops a hand on her shoulder, and doesn\u2019t look at Stiles. \u201cStiles,\u201d he says calmly. His voice is soft and honey smooth, tempered with an accent that is definitely not native to Beacon Hills. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d \u201cLike some bitch hit me in the head with a brick and then strung me from the ceiling,\u201d he bites out. He\u2019s not one for patience at the best of times \u2013 if these two are going to hurt him they\u2019re going to hurt him, whether or not he sasses them won\u2019t change that. \u201cManners,\u201d the man scolds mildly, a soft tsk for emphasis. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming something of a faux pas these days, calling a woman a bitch.\u201d \u201cOh no, I\u2019m not really one for degrading women,\u201d Stiles agrees. He bares his teeth at them in a smirk he\u2019s learned from Derek. \u201cNo, I literally meant a female dog.\u201d The woman growls at him, flashing canines decidedly too long to be human and eyes that glow a hot, angry red. Alpha, then. She\u2019s an alpha. And the man \u2013 he\u2019s definitely wearing glasses, tinted so Stiles can\u2019t see his eyes, but he\u2019s certain that the woman is deferring to him, now more than ever as she stills and reins herself in again when he tightens his grip on her shoulder. Which means he\u2019s an alpha too. They\u2019re both alphas, the whole pack of them had been alphas. Stiles\u2019 pack has been fighting off a pack of five fucking alpha werewolves for months now, and all he can think is that even now he can\u2019t help but be gut-burstingly proud of them for lasting this long. \u201cI see Hale\u2019s been remiss in teaching you to respect your superiors,\u201d the male alpha says coolly. Stiles can\u2019t shrug, strung up the way he is and hanging from his hands, so he settles for a blas\u00e9 little twist of his mouth. \u201cMaybe he has,\u201d he scoffs. \u201cHe\u2019s never really mentioned you before though, so I can\u2019t say I know for certain that you really are all that superior.\u201d The words are barely out of his mouth when there\u2019s a crack snapping through the empty room, and it\u2019s only when Stiles\u2019 head slams into his arm does he realize it\u2019s because he just got slapped. No, not even. He just got kicked, the female alpha standing in front of him with her bare feet on the floor and her arms folded lightly across her chest, and he can feel light scratches across his cheek where her toe claws scraped his skin. Ew. \u201cKali,\u201d the man admonishes. He\u2019s British, Stiles thinks. The accent sounds vaguely British, either like he left there a long, long time ago or has just recently marathoned the entirety of Doctor Who. \u201cStiles is our guest, and we haven\u2019t even introduced ourselves. This is Kali,\u201d he says magnanimously, gesturing to the female alpha, \u201cand my name is Deucalion.\u201d \u201cAnd it\u2019s just the two of you,\u201d Stiles continues, cracking his jaw slightly as he drags his head back around to face the two alphas. \u201cDerek\u2019s pack killed the other three.\u201d \u201cDerek\u2019s pack?\u201d Deucalion arches an eyebrow, high enough that Stiles can see it over the frame of his glasses. \u201cUh\u2026the Hale pack?\u201d Stiles guesses. \u201cThe pack that has an actual logical hierarchy and more than two remaining members? The not-yours pack?\u201d \u201cDo you not,\u201d Deucalion replies, stepping preemptively in front of Kali, \u201cconsider the pack as your own? Being the alpha\u2019s mate, and all?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry, being the what?\u201d Stiles blurts out. He\u2019s completely lost the edge of attitude he was trying to maintain, too busy being flabbergasted by what Deucalion just said. Stiles being whose what? \u201cI told you he wasn\u2019t,\u201d Kali butts in, sneering at him from behind Deucalion\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHale\u2019s all brawn, little brains, and a lousy alpha, but he\u2019s not actually stupid enough to take on a sixteen year old human kid as his mate.\u201d \u201cHey,\u201d Stiles snaps, offended, \u201cI\u2019m like less than six months away from eighteen, thank you very much. And lets be honest, Derek could do a lot worse than me.\u201d This, he has to admit, wasn\u2019t anything like what he would have imagined getting kidnapped by two alpha werewolves would be like. \u201cHe may not be the alpha\u2019s mate in the traditional way,\u201d Deucalion counters. He sounds considering, and in a weird way not unlike Stiles\u2019 dad when he\u2019s working his way through evidence in a case, and that freaks Stiles out a lot more than toe claws on a short tempered lady alpha. \u201cAt least, not yet. He\u2019s something though, Kali, even you can admit that.\u201d \u201cYeah, human,\u201d Stiles snipes. \u201cAnd underage. And the sheriff\u2019s son, which makes the whole kidnapping thing kind of a mistake on your part.\u201d \u201cYour father won\u2019t notice you\u2019re gone until the morning,\u201d Kali snarls at him. \u201cJust think about how much fun we could have until then.\u201d \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d Deucalion says mildly, \u201cyou\u2019re more use to us alive than dead.\u201d And there it is. There\u2019s the moment when his fa\u00e7ade of rationality becomes downright terrifying, because villains like Kali wear their crazy on their faces for the world to see, but villains like Deucalion are intelligent enough to know how to hide it and isn\u2019t that horrifying. \u201cMore use?\u201d Stiles splutters. For the first time he tries to shuffle back, sneakers scrabbling across the ground as he pushes back into the wall behind him. \u201cUse as what?\u201d Deucalion grins at him, smarmy and sharp at the same time, and it\u2019s like ice down Stiles\u2019 spine. Really, he really should have seen this coming, even before Kali wound up to deliver yet another blow across his face, snapping his head back into the wall behind him for a double assault that knocks him out cold. \u201cBait.\u201d\n The next time he comes to the room is dark and his head is throbbing. He\u2019s slumped forward as much as the chain his arms are still hanging from will allow, chin against his chest, shoulders aching. It takes him a little longer to pull himself together this time, a little bit more to push through the foggy haze of hurts hurts everything hurts why why why. It\u2019s a few minutes of blinking slowly into the darkness, trying and failing to find any bit of light to adjust to, before he realizes his ears aren\u2019t ringing from his lingering head wound. No, his ears are ringing from noise. A whole fuckton of noise, frankly, the full macabre orchestra of screams and roars, of metal clanging against metal, sneering shouts that sound suspiciously like bad action movie smack-talk. Stiles isn\u2019t sure how long it goes on. He thinks he might be fading in and out of consciousness for a while there; he has no way to mark the passing of time, not really, but there\u2019s long moments when he\u2019s not consciously aware of anything only to be startled back to the here and now by the crash of a body against an outer wall, the roar and answering snarl of his pack challenging the alphas. But it\u2019s the sound of gunfire that truly snaps him awake, that has his head jerking upright as he scrambles to get his legs underneath him, trying to wedge his fingers into the cuffs to alleviate some of the pressure on his wrists. There\u2019s five resounding cracks one after another, followed almost immediately by an ear-splitting explosion that shakes the very foundations of the room Stiles is still in\u2026 and then nothing. Silence. \u201cDer-ek,\u201d he chokes out. His voice comes out thin and quiet, he can\u2019t even try to muster the false bravado he\u2019d been filled with earlier. There\u2019s still nothing from the other room, not a shout or a roar or a thud or even the smoldering remains of whatever had exploded, and Stiles tries desperately not to consider what that might mean. \u201cDer \u2013\u201d he tries again, a little more desperate this time. His pack is smart. His pack is brilliant and brave and they came after him, and there were only two alphas and eight of them, and they\u2019ve survived all this time against a relentless threat from another pack, and they\u2019re fine. They\u2019re fine. The door flies open with a resounding crash, splashing harsh, too-bright light into the previously pitch-black room. Stiles shies away from it, pressing his face into his bicep, but he\u2019d gotten enough of a glimpse of the silhouette in the doorway that he\u2019s not afraid of the fast, heavy footsteps drawing closer. He\u2019d recognize that ridiculous reverse ducktail shit anywhere. \u201cD\u2019rek,\u201d he slurs again, gingerly lifting his head from his arm and blinking into the lit room. Derek\u2019s only a step away by the time Stiles regains meager control over his vision, and he doesn\u2019t stop there. There\u2019s no space between them a second later; Derek\u2019s hands drop to Stiles\u2019 thighs, hoisting him up and wrapping them around Derek\u2019s waist, and Stiles can\u2019t help but sob with the relief of not dangling his entire body weight from his wrists anymore. \u201cStiles,\u201d Derek keeps saying, over and over, broken and frantic. \u201cStiles, Jesus.\u201d \u201c\u2019M okay,\u201d he mumbles, a poor man\u2019s attempt at reassurance. Derek keeps one arm under Stiles\u2019 ass, holding him firmly against that brick wall of a torso, and raises his other up to gingerly lift the handcuffs binding Stiles\u2019 wrists up and over the lip of the heavy metal hook. Stiles falls forward instantly, his still-cuffed arms dropping around Derek\u2019s neck in an effort to brace himself against broad shoulders. Derek\u2019s free hand slides into his hair, down his spine, up and over his aching shoulder, and Stiles buries his face in his alpha\u2019s neck and tries to remember how to breathe. \u201cStiles,\u201d Derek is still whispering hoarsely, pressing the word into Stiles\u2019 battered skin. \u201cOkay,\u201d Stiles breathes back, exhaling over Derek\u2019s bloody neck. \u201cI\u2019m okay, I\u2019m okay.\u201d He uses the elbows still on Derek\u2019s shoulders to push himself upright, just far enough to look Derek in the eye. His vision\u2019s shoddy at best, head still pounding in an ominous kind of way, but even from here he can tell that Derek looks wrecked. \u201cStiles,\u201d Derek breathes out, one last time. They\u2019re close enough that Stiles feels the weight of his name against his own lips, feels the shiver of fear and longing and loss ripping through Derek on the exhale. He feels the stroke of Derek\u2019s hand against the base of his throbbing skull, cradling his head delicately, and finally the harsh, desperate drag of Derek\u2019s lips against his own. It leaves him lightheaded, already racing pulse shooting off like a jackrabbit, and desperately wishing he could pull himself together enough to do anything more. \u201cYeah,\u201d he sighs quietly, breaking away to sag back down to drop his forehead on Derek\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYeah, Derek. Yes.\u201d He\u2019s unconscious again before he hears Derek\u2019s response.\n The steady beep of a heart monitor shouldn\u2019t be comforting, the sterile scent of antiseptic and bleached sheets and plastic shouldn\u2019t be so familiar, but Stiles has never been so grateful to wake up in a hospital before. His dad doesn\u2019t look like he much shares the sentiment. \u201cDaaad,\u201d Stiles drawls, attempting a reassuring smile that definitely misses the mark. It feels more like a grimace, which is really much more suited to the flat unimpressed stare the sheriff\u2019s wearing. It\u2019s the long-suffering expression of a parent who just can\u2019t imagine what he must have done in a past life to wind up with a kid like this, but at least it\u2019s tempered with the familiar fond exasperation usually directed toward Stiles. \u201cWerewolves, Stiles?\u201d Oh shit. He means to laugh, or play dumb or stupid or innocent or something. A shaky, slightly scandalized laugh and a breathless exhale of \u201cwho told you!?\u201d somehow squeaks out instead. \u201cYour mother,\u201d Sheriff Stilinski sighs, and it\u2019s such an unexpected answer that Stiles waits for the punch line, or thinks maybe that\u2019s supposed to be the punch line. His dad looks deadly serious though, and the uncomfortable tug of an IV tube under the skin of his hand when he goes to card his fingers through his hair reminds Stiles that they\u2019re not exactly in a jokey kind of situation here. He takes a moment to be distracted by the state of his wrists, the heavy bruising and red chaffing, before blinking back up at his dad again. \u201cMom wasn\u2019t \u2013\u201d she couldn\u2019t have been. Cancer couldn\u2019t have killed a werewolf, wouldn\u2019t have killed a werewolf, and his mother would never, ever have been a hunter. \u201cShe was human,\u201d he agrees. \u201cBorn into a large pack from the East Coast. They were\u2026a bit more strict about the tradition, and when she left the pack for a human, an outsider, they told her not to bother coming back.\u201d Stiles\u2019 head reels from more than just the lingering concussion this time. His mom. It makes a lot of sense, really \u2013 explains the stories, the way she was spot on with every single piece of lore she ever told him. Maybe it even explains the way something in Stiles feels the pack in his bones, like running with wolves is coded in his very DNA. He doesn\u2019t ask the obvious. Accepting the bite as an attempted cure had to have occurred to his parents, and his mom was nothing if not gloriously stubborn if she felt she had a good reason. He\u2019s not going to put his dad in the position of explaining that to him. \u201cYou\u2019ve known the whole time, then,\u201d he accuses instead. \u201cSince before you even took the job?\u201d His dad nods. \u201cIt\u2019s why I took it,\u201d he admits. \u201cI thought maybe having law enforcement around with some background knowledge about the supernatural might be helpful. And I can\u2019t say I was all that surprised when you started bringing home strays, you always did have a knack for getting right in the thick of things.\u201d \u201cBunch of puppies,\u201d Stiles grumbles. \u201cDon\u2019t act like you wouldn\u2019t have done the same.\u201d \u201cMom definitely would have,\u201d his dad smiles. \u201cShe would have rounded up that whole pack, dumbass alpha included, before school even started,\u201d Stiles snorts. \u201cDerek wouldn\u2019t have known what hit him.\u201d \u201cOh, something would\u2019ve hit Derek, all right,\u201d his dad agrees. Stiles blinks at the sudden detour into defensive. \u201cHe saved my life.\u201d \u201cTrust me, it\u2019s all anyone can talk about. Derek Hale, bursting through the ER doors like an action star in this summer\u2019s blockbuster, bloody and filthy and wrecked and carrying you like the damsel you are. Ask the nurses about it, they\u2019ll give you a much more vivid description,\u201d his dad gripes back, looking decidedly unimpressed by the whole thing. \u201cThey might even show you the video, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the security footage made it onto YouTube somewhere.\u201d \u201cDerek\u2019s quite a sight to behold,\u201d Stiles smirks, because he\u2019s only too familiar with the tizzy the hospital staff must be in. \u201cCan\u2019t blame them for appreciating the opportunity.\u201d \u201cAnd exactly how much beholding are you doing?\u201d his dad shoots back wryly. Stiles has a flash of blood-slick fingers scraping through his hair, harsh breath exhaled across his dry lips, and fights to keep his face void of the lovesick expression he\u2019s been starting to notice on himself the last few weeks. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what you\u2019re trying to imply with that,\u201d he scoffs, rolling his eyes (and promptly regretting that. Immediately. Ow.). \u201cHave you ever even seen Derek around the house?\u201d \u201cHe hasn\u2019t left this hospital since he brought you here. None of them have, actually. They\u2019re causing something of a scene, camped out in the middle of the waiting room looking like a bunch of extras in a slasher flick.\u201d \u201cBless them,\u201d Stiles says fondly, \u201csubtlety\u2019s a lost art on them.\u201d \u201cStiles\u2026\u201d his dad warns. Stiles sighs. \u201cCome on, Dad,\u201d he whines back. \u201cI\u2019m pack, clearly the adoption papers have gone through, it\u2019s all legal, the wolf cub strays I took in have flipped the cards and now I\u2019m the local pack\u2019s pet. It\u2019s all fluffy and lovely and nice when I\u2019m not getting my skull bashed in, so obviously Alpha Sourwolf over there is just keeping an eye on the runt of the litter.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d consider that whole statement a sign of brain damage, but I\u2019m sure it made sense in your head.\u201d His dad shakes his head with the kind of fond exasperation Stiles is intimately familiar with and straightens up out of the chair he\u2019d been sitting in. \u201cI\u2019m going to go let the doctor know you\u2019re awake.\u201d He steps forward and bends down to Stiles\u2019 level, pressing a rare kiss to an unbruised section of his son\u2019s temple and gently ruffling Stiles\u2019 hair. \u201cYou\u2019re a good kid,\u201d his dad says quietly. \u201cI\u2019ll kill you if you ever do that to me ever again, but you\u2019re a damn good kid.\u201d\n \u201cThey\u2019re saying they want to keep you overnight, but you can go home in the morning as long as everything looks okay,\u201d Scott tells him. He\u2019s got his head tilted toward the door not unlike an oversized dog, even though Stiles is pretty sure it doesn\u2019t actually help Scott hear any better. \u201cYou have a concussion, obviously, and you\u2019re dehydrated and lost some blood and obviously got the shit beat out of you, but it sounds like they just want to pump you up with some IV supplements and you\u2019ll be good.\u201d \u201cOh good,\u201d Stiles grumbles, \u201cthen I can go home and be in stiff, sore agony for weeks without even the benefit of the good drugs to help me out.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re better than drugs,\u201d Scott reminds him, tapping his fingers against the skin of Stiles\u2019 forearm where Scott\u2019s been slowly draining the pain from him since the second he scrambled into the room. \u201cPoint,\u201d Stiles concedes. \u201cBut that\u2019s only good for as long as you guys are around and willing to touch me.\u201d \u201cPlease,\u201d Scott scoffs, rolls his eyes in a way that Stiles is 85% sure Scott picked up from him. \u201cAs if anyone\u2019s going to let you be alone for more than five minutes until you\u2019re fully healed.\u201d Scott has a point there too. The pack had appeared in his doorway seconds after his dad left the room, clearly not even bothering to pretend like they hadn\u2019t been eavesdropping, and the entire lot of them had crowded around his bed like the IV lines and the guard rails were the only things stopping them from piling right on top of him and his narrow mattress. Stiles had let them all touch him, sworn up down left and right that he was going to be fine, and then demanded that every single one of them go home, shower, change clothes, and eat something before they even considered setting foot back in this hospital room. It\u2019d taken some persuasion on, shockingly, Jackson\u2019s part, and Stiles was entirely certain he could expect Isaac back here within the hour, but most of them were apparently doing as told. Except Scott. Stubborn, loyal, wonderful Scott, who\u2019d waited until everyone else left before insisting that he could shower just fine in Stiles\u2019 en suite, cajoled his mom into bringing him a spare change of clothes from his lacrosse bag in her car, and promptly planted himself at the foot of Stiles\u2019 bed. And, of course, Derek. Because Derek was glaringly, obviously, conspicuously missing, despite his dad\u2019s insistence that Derek hadn\u2019t left the waiting room since Stiles was admitted, and everyone just got shifty-eyed and awkward when Stiles had started to ask. \u201cHow long before Isaac gets here, do you think?\u201d Stiles sighs. It\u2019d been twenty minutes since Stiles had kicked them all out, and Isaac\u2019s foster parents only lived ten minutes from the hospital. \u201cHe said he\u2019s getting changed and then getting in the car,\u201d Scott admits sheepishly, holding up the phone in his free hand. \u201cSo I\u2019d say about another ten, maybe fifteen minutes?\u201d Stiles rolls his eyes and pretends he doesn\u2019t notice the surge of affection filling his chest. \u201cRemind him that my instructions included food,\u201d he says instead. \u201cAnd maybe also that I haven\u2019t eaten anything but hospital food in like three years.\u201d \u201cYou were missing for four hours tops,\u201d Scott argues, even though he\u2019s already dutifully typing out a new text. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t even been a full twenty-four hours since we had Little Vincent\u2019s.\u201d \u201cIt felt like years,\u201d Stiles insists. \u201cYears. Besides, how do you even know, you don\u2019t know how much time passed between when they took me and when someone noticed.\u201d \u201cYeah, I do,\u201d Scott nods, tossing his phone onto Stiles\u2019 lap. There\u2019s a mass text from Derek open on the screen, SOS AT STILES\u2019 HOUSE NOW, sent to the entire pack at 9:37 PM. He\u2019d passed the vaguely-accurate grandfather clock in the hallway on his way to bring the garbage out, it had been a little after 9:30 when he stepped outside and got knocked out by Kali. \u201cI was with him when he sent that text,\u201d Scott continues. \u201cDude, he was mid-sentence and all of a sudden like bugged out. He knew right away that something was wrong, like he could feel it or something, and then we got to your house and we could smell Kali and there was a triskele carved into your garage door and, well\u2026\u201d They\u2019re skirting dangerously close to weird territory here. Stiles is torn between insatiable curiosity and the unspoken agreement that they Do Not Acknowledge this ongoing thing between him and Derek. Scott\u2019s starting to look vaguely trapped, like he\u2019s only just realized where he\u2019s leading Stiles\u2019 train of thought, and Stiles can\u2019t bring himself to put that on his best friend. \u201cI told you months ago man, hanging out with werewolves is like having the best bodyguards in the world,\u201d Stiles reminds him. He leans back into his pillows as he does, gently tugging his arm free of Scott\u2019s hold in the process. He\u2019s starting to feel both loose and stuffed full of cotton all at once, and while it\u2019s nice to not hurt anymore it\u2019s not an entirely pleasant feeling. Scott lets him go without protest, leans forward only long enough to scoop up his phone again before settling back against the guard rail by Stiles\u2019 leg. \u201cIsaac says he\u2019ll bring you a sausage, egg, and cheese from Hilary\u2019s if you don\u2019t put up a fight about him coming back,\u201d he reads off the phone screen. \u201cThat\u2019s my kind of bribery,\u201d Stiles agrees. \u201cMake him bring one for you too and it\u2019s a deal. And he better be getting one for himself.\u201d \u201cYes Mom,\u201d Scott grins, catches Stiles\u2019 ankle when Stiles tries to kick his hip. Stiles can\u2019t help but grin back, and his second attempt at a kick is really more of a light nudge of his sock-covered toes against Scott\u2019s side. \u201cHey,\u201d he says quietly, \u201cthanks for coming to save my sorry ass.\u201d Scott squeezes his fingers where they\u2019re still wrapped around Stiles\u2019 ankle, gives him another, smaller smile. \u201cYeah,\u201d he shrugs. \u201cThat\u2019s what pack\u2019s for.\u201d\n As promised, Stiles is released just before noon after a lengthy lecture from a combination of his doctor, his dad, and Ms. McCall that involves taking it easy, not overexerting himself, and a scolding reminder that french fries and frozen fast food are not a food group that will help him heal any faster (that one comes from Ms. McCall, and Stiles spends the entire lecture making Significant Eyebrows at his dad). Also as promised, Stiles gets home and finds Lydia sitting at his desk, systematically downvoting everything he\u2019s ever posted on Reddit. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a Thursday,\u201d he points out in lieu of a greeting, not letting her presence stop him from heading straight towards his favorite pair of oversized Lakeport Track and Field sweats still sitting in a crumpled heap at the foot of his bed. \u201cWhich means you\u2019re definitely supposed to be in\u2026APUSH right now.\u201d \u201cWe agreed out of everyone I\u2019m the one who could most afford to miss a day of class,\u201d she shrugs. \u201cAnd you\u2019re on twenty-four hour watch.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not suicidal,\u201d he complains grumpily, shamelessly dropping trou and kicking away the slightly-too-small jeans his dad had brought to the hospital. \u201cI\u2019m not going to slit my wrists in a fit of PTSD the second one of you leaves me alone.\u201d \u201cNo, but Derek might,\u201d Lydia agrees. She finally turns to look at him as he\u2019s pulling the elastic waistband up over his hips, and Stiles can only hope the flatly unimpressed look on her face is a result of Derek\u2019s behavior and not Stiles\u2019 shirtless back. \u201cWell then he should be here instead of you,\u201d and oh, yeah, there\u2019s that bitterness he\u2019s been holding back all morning. Stiles was wondering when that was going to show up. Lydia only tuts impatiently at him, and again it\u2019s unclear if it\u2019s over his grievance or his pathetic attempts at lifting his arms enough to pull a clean shirt over his head. She\u2019s out of his desk chair and across the room before he can ask, batting his old school Something Corporate shirt from his hands and digging through his drawers like she knows exactly where everything is (he wouldn\u2019t be surprised). She straightens up with his softest flannel button-down clutched between her fingers, and Stiles entirely deserves the scathing look she gives him for not having thought of that himself. \u201cSometimes the fact that you outrank me is genuinely horrifying,\u201d she sighs, helping him ease the shirt over his still-aching shoulders. \u201cThey haven\u2019t released class ranks yet,\u201d he reminds her. It\u2019s a willful kind of ignorance, or a feigned confusion, something like that, because thanks to Deucalion he knows damn well what Lydia\u2019s talking about and from the look on her face she knows he does. \u201cYou two are unbelievable.\u201d The gentleness of her hands nudging him back towards his bed completely belie the harshness in her tone. \u201cYou\u2019re going to make him say it, because you\u2019ll never believe it until you hear it from him himself, and he\u2019s never going to say it because he\u2019s never going to believe you actually want it.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d like to remind you I\u2019ve suffered recent head trauma,\u201d he argues, happily falling onto his bed and leaving more than enough room for Lydia to settle down next to him. \u201cYou have to be nice and forgiving and not vague and confusing.\u201d She levels him with one of her most scathing, I-see-through-your-sad-bullshit stares, but she still gathers up his laptop and climbs onto the bed with him, and Stiles accepts the subject drop as the once in a lifetime gift he knows it is. They marathon Survivor: Caramoan (Stiles likes the challenges, Lydia likes the manipulation, they both like the shameless backstabbing). Jackson joins them halfway through the fourth episode, Boyd shows up just in time for the merge. Lydia, for what she swears is the first and last time ever, makes them all tomato and avocado grilled cheese sandwiches for dinner, and Stiles falls asleep thinking that even though none of the bodies curled around his are really the one he wants, it\u2019s still really, really nice to know he\u2019s not alone.\n Stiles wakes up to a mostly dark room, a pile of blonde curls on his chest and an obvious lack of Lydia, Boyd, or Jackson. Erica\u2019s eyes are reflecting amber in the dim glow from her cell phone, flashing up at him when he starts threading two fingers through one of her messy curls, and she flicks her gaze pointedly between her phone and him. He finds his own phone wedged under his shoulder, two new texts and a low battery warning on his screen. The first is a message from Lydia saying she\u2019ll be back a little bit after school tomorrow that Stiles couldn\u2019t care less about the second he sees the one from Erica.Derek\u2019s on the roof.how long has he been there? He texts her back, squinting at the time stamp. The text was from forty-five minutes ago, presumably when Erica got there, but that doesn\u2019t really mean anything.Boyd and Jackson both said he was there the whole time they were here she texts back quickly. She\u2019s already typing out a second message before Stiles can even start to respond, he doesn\u2019t have to wait long before she adds so I\u2019d guess he\u2019s been here since you got home. Stiles makes a face up at his ceiling, baring his teeth and snarling soundlessly at the dumbass werewolf no doubt sitting right above him. There\u2019s no doubt in his mind that, if Derek\u2019s there now, he\u2019s been there the whole time.wanna leave so I can make him come inside? Erica doesn\u2019t bother answering. She flounces up out of bed like it\u2019s not 4:30 in the morning, blows him a kiss, and leaves the window as wide open as it\u2019ll go when she does her typically ostentatious back-flip out into his backyard. \u201cShowoff,\u201d Stiles grumbles good-naturedly. Erica texts him a kissy emoji in response. \u201cI know you\u2019re up there,\u201d Stiles says quietly, once enough time has passed that Erica should be out of hearing distance. \u201cI know you\u2019ve been up there.\u201d There\u2019s no response to that, but he hadn\u2019t really expected it to be that easy. Derek\u2019s nothing if not a frustrating tangle of layers, if he\u2019s insisting on playing this game he\u2019s definitely going to be stubborn about it. Fine, Stiles can bring out the big guns if he has to. \u201cOkay,\u201d he says agreeably, shoving blankets away and scooting to the edge of his bed, planting both feet on the floor. \u201cWe can do this one of two ways. You can come down here, or I can come up there. Odds are probably not in my favor on that one, but hey, I survived getting kidnapped by a pair of murderous alphas, I\u2019m sure falling from my second-floor gutter probably won\u2019t \u2013 hey.\u201d Derek swung through the window wearing his most unimpressed expression, like that\u2019ll work. Please. Stiles has spent the day with Lydia. \u201cWas that really so hard?\u201d \u201cYou should be sleeping,\u201d Derek grumbles. It sounds about as childish as he looks, all petulant and stubborn and stupid. \u201cI should be sleeping,\u201d Stiles agrees. \u201cPreferably with you. In my bed. Where you \u2013\u201d He cuts himself off before he can say belong \u2013 he hadn\u2019t really meant to say any of that, hadn\u2019t at all planned on going straight there. \u00a0Derek winces slightly, like Stiles\u2019 frustration hurts, but he doesn\u2019t move from where he\u2019s still standing in front of the window. \u201cStiles, I don\u2019t\u2026\u201d he lets out a sharp huff of air, glaring at the floor by Stiles\u2019 feet. \u201cScott told me he was with you,\u201d Stiles tries. This wasn\u2019t really the direction he\u2019d been planning on going either, but he\u2019s pretty sure any tentative plans he might have made should really just go right out the window. \u201cThat you knew, right away, that something had happened to me.\u201d Derek closes his eyes, scrubs a hand down his face. Stiles can see the moment he gives in (as if he hadn\u2019t lost the battle the second he stepped foot inside Stiles\u2019 room); his whole body droops, shoulders and chest and hips, and when he scrubs his hand back up to push through his hair he just looks tired. \u201cIt was an instinct,\u201d he admits, nodding slightly. \u201cJust a\u2026feeling. I don\u2019t know, it happens sometimes with the betas but never with any of the humans before.\u201d \u201cDo you think it\u2019s because of my mom?\u201d Derek shrugs, and the fact that he doesn\u2019t even look slightly confused just completely confirms that the entire pack had been listening in to Stiles\u2019 conversation with his dad. It makes him wonder exactly how long Derek stuck around for, if he\u2019d really left the hospital when the rest of them say he did or if he just left the waiting room and found somewhere else to lurk obsessively. \u201cYou don\u2019t,\u201d Stiles guesses, squinting up at Derek to try and better read his expression. \u201cYou have a theory, but it\u2019s not that.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s a pack thing.\u201d \u201cRight,\u201d Stiles nods, \u201cexcept Lydia and Allison are pack and you just said you\u2019ve never felt any kind of alpha-y instinct with them.\u201d \u201cLydia and Allison are \u2013\u201d Derek blows out a breath, presses his lips together, and tries again. \u201cLydia and Allison are pack in the way that the collective pack considers them to be and so they are. They started out as a package deal with Jackson and Scott which meant there was no getting rid of them, until they eventually started to really be pack.\u201d \u201cBut they\u2019re not your pack,\u201d Stiles continues, following the dots he thinks Derek\u2019s trying to connect. \u201cNot really. You\u2019ve never really bonded with them the way you\u2019d need to, not enough to forge that kind of connection anyway.\u201d Derek just nods. Really, Stiles shouldn\u2019t go the last step. Shouldn\u2019t, maybe, but he needs to. They\u2019ve been dancing around this for too long, pretending there\u2019s nothing to address here, but the invading pack is gone and hopefully the threat\u2019s backed off for at least a little while and there\u2019s no time like the present. \u201cBut you did with me.\u201d Derek nods again. \u201cDerek\u2026\u201d Stiles says softly. For all that he wants to talk about it he doesn\u2019t really know where to start. Getting Derek to stop standing stiff and uncomfortable on the other side of the room, jacket wrapped around his chest, fingers curled up into his cuffs, that sounds like an okay place to try. He doesn\u2019t need to elaborate. Derek heaves another impressive sigh before finally shrugging his jacket off his shoulders, reaching down to untie the laces on his boots. He leaves both in a pile next to Stiles\u2019 desk before moving closer to the bed. Stiles doesn\u2019t say anything when Derek seats himself on the far corner of the foot of his mattress, putting as much distance between them as possible. He\u2019s not sure who the distance is meant for, him or Derek, but he\u2019s willing to fight his battles one by one and not all at once. All he does is pull his legs back up onto the bed, turning and scooting back until his shoulders are propped against the headboard and he can look straight at Derek. \u201cWhat made you come here that first night?\u201d \u201cInstinct. I don\u2019t know,\u201d Derek shrugs. It sounds honest, slightly frustrated with his lack of understanding instead of petulant, so Stiles keeps his mouth shut and waits. \u201cI didn\u2019t know where I was until I woke up the next morning,\u201d Derek finally adds. He\u2019s got his hands balled up into fists against his knees, staring at his knuckles instead of looking anywhere near Stiles. \u201cEverything hurt, and I knew I had to get somewhere safe, and my family\u2019s house isn\u2019t safe anymore and I didn\u2019t know if my loft was either, and I just\u2026\u201d Instinct. The Stilinski\u2019s house had already become something of a safe haven for the rest of Derek\u2019s pack, whether it was a feeling or an overheard conversation or some base animal instinct, some subconscious part of him could have picked up on that. \u201cOkay,\u201d Stiles concedes. \u201cSo then why\u2019d you keep coming back? Obviously it wasn\u2019t for my charming personality and sparkling wit.\u201d Derek huffs out a laugh, shaking his head slightly. \u201cNot quite,\u201d he agrees. \u201cBut I\u2019ve met worse.\u201d \u201cI mean, you did bite Jackson,\u201d Stiles reminds him, lips quirking in a tentative smile. \u201cWe all make mistakes,\u201d Derek grumbles. \u201cBut. My loft is\u2026spartan, I guess. And the pack doesn\u2019t come over there unless there\u2019s something they need. The train depot we were using for training is a public space. And my family\u2019s house is mostly in ruins, and the Argents used it as a base last spring, so.\u201d And doesn\u2019t that just break Stiles\u2019 heart into a million pathetic pieces. He\u2019d suspected, maybe, kind of figured it had something to do with his house in the beginning. New as it was for the Stilinskis, this place was a home. He and his dad lived here, and more and more often as the fall flew by the rest of the pack started living here too. It might not have been Derek\u2019s home, and it might not have housed anyone that Derek actually liked, but it was safe and warm and comfortable and smelled like pack and felt like family, and of course Derek was drawn to that even if he didn\u2019t want to be. \u201cWhy\u2019d you let me?\u201d Stiles lifts his head in surprise, glancing over to where Derek still isn\u2019t looking at him. The question doesn\u2019t necessarily throw him, more the fact that Derek was actually willing to ask. \u201cI could tell you needed it,\u201d he shrugs after a long moment. His fingers are fumbling with the bandages over his wrists, nails catching under the curling edges of the adhesive strips holding the gauze down. \u201cPlus I felt\u2026I don\u2019t know, it felt wrong to be bonding with the rest of your pack and not make any effort with their alpha.\u201d \u201cYou called me your alpha earlier,\u201d Derek admits. \u201cIn the car, on the way to the hospital. I don\u2019t think you were really actually coherent, but you still\u2026\u201d \u201cYou are,\u201d Stiles exhales. \u201cYou are my alpha.\u201d Derek doesn\u2019t say anything to that. He closes his eyes, flexes his fingers a bit against his thighs, but doesn\u2019t say a word. \u201cDeucalion said \u2013\u201d \u201cI know what Deucalion said,\u201d Derek cuts in. \u201cHe was wrong.\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d Stiles nods, \u201cbut.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re sixteen,\u201d Derek growls. It\u2019s the closest to actually sounding annoyed he\u2019s gotten so far, but there\u2019s never been an issue Stiles has been more willing to push in his entire life. \u201cI\u2019m not saying we should get married,\u201d Stiles shoots back. \u201cAnd I\u2019m seventeen. In fact, I\u2019m only four and a half months away from my eighteenth birthday, so technically I\u2019m closer to eighteen than I am to seventeen.\u201d Derek actually frowns at that, glancing over not quite at Stiles but somewhere around his knees, and Stiles sighs. \u201cI got held back a year,\u201d he elaborates. \u201cIn elementary school, before they diagnosed the ADHD. I\u2019m seventeen. And I\u2019m not trying to talk you into a nice little go-round of statutory rape here, dumbass. Not against your will, anyway. I\u2019m just saying maybe you need me. Maybe I kind of need you too. And maybe the pack needs both of us.\u201d Realistically, Stiles didn\u2019t expect Derek to have anything to say to that. At least not right away. So the silence that stretches between them doesn\u2019t necessarily surprise him, or even bother him all that much. The distance, though. The distance is starting to. The way Derek is holding himself so far away, so separate, when they both know that what they really need is closeness and reassurance, Stiles anchoring himself to something safe, Derek proving to himself that they survived intact. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m not going to jump you the second you get too close,\u201d he finally snaps. Derek actually startles a little bit at that, looks up at Stiles for a split second before determinedly redirecting his stare back down at the expanse of bed between them. \u201cI mean,\u201d Stiles tries again, aiming for a little more calm this time, \u201cyou\u2019re practically hanging off the edge of the bed. You look like you haven\u2019t sle\u2026you haven\u2019t slept at all, have you?\u201d Of course he hasn\u2019t. Of course Derek hasn\u2019t slept, of course he\u2019d sat up in a quiet panic the entire time Stiles was in the hospital, perched himself on the roof outside Stiles\u2019 bedroom. He\u2019s probably been wide awake the entire time, even though twenty-four hours ago he was in a throw down final boss battle and killed two alpha werewolves. Stiles should consider it lucky that Derek even managed to shower, because at least he\u2019s not getting other people\u2019s blood all over Stiles\u2019 sheets. Derek kind of shrugs. It\u2019s meant to look indifferent, Stiles thinks, but misses the mark somewhat. Or maybe it\u2019s just him, finally wrapping his head around the fact that whether or not Derek has all the answers, some of the answers, or none of the answers doesn\u2019t really matter. What matters is that he\u2019s here, sitting on Stiles\u2019 bed at the end of a hellish day, looking up the mattress in a way that almost looks like longing. \u201cJust\u2026come here,\u201d Stiles says quietly. Derek looks up for real at that. Looks up and looks at him, finally, hazel eyes wide but steady as they hold Stiles\u2019 gaze. He\u2019s searching for something, for answers that Stiles isn\u2019t sure about the questions for but is content to let him look. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to figure everything out now,\u201d he continues softly. \u201cThe other pack\u2019s gone, we have time. You deserve comfy pajamas and a good night of sleep in a warm bed, and if that\u2019s your own bed in your loft by yourself then fine, that\u2019s okay, but I don\u2019t think it is. So either leave, and go home, or come here.\u201d When Derek stands up, pushing himself fully upright off the bed and stepping into the middle of the room, Stiles is pretty sure he can actually feel his heart drop into the pit of his stomach. He\u2019s determined to keep looking, to make it as awkward as possible, to not give Derek the easy out of having a clean escape. So when Derek\u2019s hands go to his jeans, flipping open buttons and shoving the tight denim down his thighs, Stiles practically chokes on his own tongue. Because holy god, there\u2019s something downright obscene about the way Derek bends at the waist, lifting his feet off the floor to tug his jeans free, hook a finger into the heal of each sock and pull those off too. Stiles has seen hundreds of guys changing before, in locker rooms before gym, on buses on the way to meets, but never like this. Never backlit by moonlight in an otherwise silent room, shamelessly aware of his audience and still not hesitating for a second to reach up and peel the burgundy shirt up over his head. Stiles stares as Derek drops the pile of clothing on top of his abandoned boots before turning back to the bed, nudging Stiles\u2019 shoulder lightly until Stiles takes the hint and shuffles across to his side of the bed. He lowers himself gingerly back until he\u2019s laying flat again, sore shoulders against his softest pillow, and Derek wastes no time in sliding in next to him. \u201cOkay?\u201d Derek asks quietly. Stiles glances over at him. They\u2019re both flat on their backs on separate halves of the bed, just like they always are, and no. No, it\u2019s not okay. Because yes, he\u2019d meant what he\u2019d said about Derek deserving a good, comfortable night of sleep, but he\u2019s pretty sure he deserves one too. He\u2019s pretty sure he deserves, even if it\u2019s just this once, to get what he wants out of this. \u201cNot quite,\u201d he whispers back. He rolls over before Derek can ask, ignoring the protest in his arms as he curls his body into the side of Derek\u2019s, torso propped against Derek\u2019s chest and one arm low over his stomach. Derek feels like he\u2019s holding his breath, tense under Stiles\u2019 weight, and Stiles can already feel the slow creep of guilt curling in his stomach. \u201cI\u2019m a cuddler,\u201d he mumbles. \u201cAnd sleeping with you in my bed all the time and not being able to cuddle is torture. But if it really bothers you, I can \u2013\u201d he starts to pull back, twisting back over away from Derek, when Derek\u2019s arm falls gingerly across his shoulder blades, his hand curled at the nape of Stiles\u2019 neck. \u201cNo,\u201d Derek says quickly. \u201cThis is \u2013 this is good. Stay.\u201d \u201cYeah?\u201d Derek exhales slowly, and Stiles can feel the tension seeping out of him, feel the way the body beneath his slowly begins to relax into the mattress. He lets himself relax too, dropping his head back down into the crook where Derek\u2019s arm meets his shoulder. Derek\u2019s head turns toward his, jaw brushing against Stiles\u2019 messy tufts of hair, and for a second Stiles swears he feels the dry press of lips against his forehead. \u201cYeah.\u201d\n They come in stages. It starts with just Derek, who was still there when Stiles woke up this morning and hasn\u2019t left since. He\u2019s propped up against the headboard with Stiles\u2019 back against his chest, chin on Stiles\u2019 head and legs tangled together as they alternate between lazy naps and another half a dozen episodes of Criminal Minds. Isaac and Erica show up first, and if they have even the slightest reaction to actually witnessing Derek\u2019s presence in Stiles\u2019 bed, they don\u2019t show it. Isaac flops down next to Stiles, flinging an arm over Stiles\u2019 thigh and pillowing his head on his stomach, and it takes Erica maybe twenty minutes of sitting against the headboard next to Derek before she\u2019s sunk down enough to prop her head up on his shoulder. Allison and Lydia appear after their French Honor Society meeting and waste no time, Allison wedging herself into the space between Stiles\u2019 and Isaac\u2019s legs, Lydia propping herself up against Erica\u2019s calves. Boyd and Jackson both have practice, swimming for Jackson and wrestling for Boyd, and Lydia steals all thunder from their arrival barely seconds after she relinquishes her spot to Boyd and switches over to Derek\u2019s other side with Jackson when she smugly points out a familiar face in the next episode right before her sister walks into the scene. Scott shows up after his shift at Deaton\u2019s with two overflowing bags of Chinese food, eyes the space left on the bed with the calculating expression of someone deciding where to aim his canon ball for the best splash effect, and it\u2019s only then that Stiles\u2019 realizes. This is his pack. This is it, all of them. He has them all here, crammed into a bed that should never be able to fit nine people, dribbling soy sauce on his comforter and fortune cookie dust in his sheets. His foot\u2019s gone numb from the weird angle his ankle\u2019s at under Allison\u2019s butt, he\u2019s genuinely not sure if it\u2019s Jackson\u2019s hand or Lydia\u2019s curled around his hip, he\u2019s probably going to overheat from werewolves and their stupid hot bodies. Derek\u2019s hand brushes lightly across his forehead, smoothing his hair back off of his face, and Stiles holds out a piece of sweet and sour pork in silent appreciation. \u201cGross,\u201d Scott grumbles, watching Derek take the bite straight off of Stiles\u2019 fork. \u201cDoes this mean we have to start calling him Mom?\u201d Isaac adds, wrinkling his nose at Scott. \u201cStilinski\u2019s not exactly what you\u2019d call a nurturing mother figure,\u201d Erica argues, reaching two fingers into Stiles\u2019 carton and sticking her tongue out when he attempts to whack her fingers away with his utensils. \u201cDoesn\u2019t stop you from calling this Mom\u2019s House behind his back,\u201d Scott points out, squirming around like he\u2019s about to go for a piece of sweet and sour pork too. \u201cI hate all of you,\u201d Stiles whines, clutching his take out carton closer to his chest. \u201cI need new friends.\u201d \u201cLiar,\u201d Derek mumbles fondly, deftly dodging Stiles\u2019 protective fork maneuvers and stealing another piece of pork. \u201cYou love us,\u201d Lydia adds smugly, offering him a conciliatory bite of her own chicken and broccoli. And well, really, there\u2019s no point in denying that. Because he really, really does.\n I don't even know anymore. come hang out with me on tumblr, I'll be there monday nights with a bottle of wine and a box of tissues (and, well, every other day of the week too).\n\u00a0"
