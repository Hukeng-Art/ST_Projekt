    "text": "There is a sour, stabbing ache somewhere above his left eyebrow, the kind of ache he only really gets when he\u2019s had too much coffee on an empty stomach. The shrill ringing of a phone crawls unpleasantly beneath the surface of his skin. He physically swallows down the urge to rip Hoseok\u2019s phone from the wall and chuck it out the office window, watching with joy as it plummets\u00a0through the air, down three stories before crashing with a with a satisfying\u00a0bang\u00a0into the top of Namjoon\u2019s shiny new Lexus.\nIt\u2019s a Monday.\n\u201cTeam meeting,\u201d Namjoon\u2019s deep, groggy voice croaks out over the top of the small sea of cubicles.\nHe is met with a general chorus of discontented groans that grumble up from all around the large, divided room and merge into one collective \u2018No.\u2019\n\u201cI brought donuts.\u201d\nThe shift in the atmosphere is disconcerting. There is a clattering of rolling wheels and shifting papers, followed shortly by a dull thud that Yoongi recognizes as the sound of a body hitting a flimsy cubicle wall. The surface of his coffee vibrates warningly.\n\u201cOuch, fucking watch it, Tae,\u201d Jimin whines from nearby.\nYoongi heaves a bracing breath, pushing himself up unwillingly from his chair and watching the blur that is Taehyung as he races past the entrance of his cubicle. Yoongi, however, takes his time, meandering down the aisle in a leisurely fashion, taking the opportunity\u00a0to observe the cheap, grey carpet as his feet shuffle unenthusiastically over its dull surface.\nWhen he finally steps into the conference room, he is greeted with the backs of his co-workers as they jostle for position around the small, shaky table in the corner. Jungkook crawls out from between Hoseok\u2019s legs, hands full of donuts, with one more trapped between his rather large front teeth for good measure.\nJimin and Taehyung have long since emerged triumphant, already settled into two chairs in the corner. Yoongi watches with disgust as Taehyung licks the donut filling from finger of an unconcerned Jimin. Yoongi rolls his eyes and plops himself down into a seat on the opposite side of the room.\n\u201cDonut?\u201d Hoseok offers him as he approaches, far too chipper for 9:00am, as always.\nYoongi cringes at the thought of sugar in his raw stomach, and the movement causes the sharp sting in his head to flare up painfully. \u201cNo thanks.\u201d Hoseok shrugs and takes a seat next to him. \u201cWhat do you think this is all about, anyway? We haven\u2019t had a Monday meeting since\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSince the last incident, I know,\u201d Hoseok replies, his cheerful face suddenly a little grim. \u201cDo you think they did something else?\u201d He jerks his head towards the corner of the room, where the three youngest are giggling at something on Jungkook\u2019s phone and apparently taking notes.\u00a0\n\u201cI feel like we would know,\u201d Yoongi reasons, brushing out a few errant wrinkles in his pants.\nHoseok seems a little lost in his thoughts, and the frightened distance in his eyes tells Yoongi that he\u2019s probably neck-deep in a flashback. \u201cYeah, we would know.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, sit down everybody. I appreciate your team spirit, Jimin, but we\u2019ve been over this, Taehyung is not a chair.\u201d Namjoon takes his place at the head of the table, straightening his glasses, which Yoongi happens to know are just for show. \u201cSo you\u2019re all probably wondering why we\u2019re here.\u201d\n\u201cIf this is about the dumpster cat\u2026\u201d Taehyung pipes up from the corner.\nNamjoon\u2019s face goes a little slack. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d\nJimin elbows him hard, and Taehyung\u2019s mouth snaps shut with a comical\u00a0click, eyes bulging. \u201cNothing. There\u2019s no pregnant dumpster cat.\u201d\nNamjoon stares at them blankly, looking quite defeated, moving only to rub his temples in frustration. His glasses go a little askew. \u201cNope. Not today,\u201d he finally decides, muttering it more to himself than to anyone else. He clears his throat and continues as if nothing has happened. \u201cSo I got a message from Corporate. According to them, our branch is falling a little behind, so they\u2019re sending in someone from the corporate office to oversee us for a while.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d Taehyung demands, brow furrowed. \u201cOur sales are awesome. Jimin and I tear that shit up.\u201d\n\u201cYes, good, let\u2019s explore that,\u201d Namjoon chuckles with false enthusiasm, and Yoongi notes the change in his gaze, the increased intensity. \u201cWhy would Corporate feel the need to throw a wrench into the workings of a beautifully functioning branch? Well, I would posit that we live in a heartless currency-driven\u00a0world run by bourgeois pigs who are so desperate for an extra buck they\u2019d fuck their own-\u201d\n\u201cDude,\u201d Hoseok gently reminds him, shaking his head almost imperceptibly. But Jungkook smirks and covertly raises his fist in solidarity.\nNamjoon sighs heavily, his eyes still hard and his mouth a tight line. \u201cBecause they want to trim costs and increase efficiency.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want some old corporate geezer cramping our style,\u201d Taehyung pouts from the corner. \u201cWhat if he takes away casual Fridays? Or commando Wednesdays?\u201d\nJimin elbows him again, hard, and Taehyung\u2019s breath actually comes whooshing gently from between his lips. \u201cThat one\u2019s not office-official, asshole,\u201d Jimin hisses at him in what he apparently thinks is a quiet voice.\n\u201cLook, I know it\u2019s not ideal,\u201d Namjoon presses on, ignoring the exchange. \u201cBut we don\u2019t really have a choice here. And if you want to keep your jobs, you\u2019ll keep the oil-based personal lubricant out of it.\u201d He directs his words to the corner of the room, where the three youngest had been whispering conspiratorially. Taehyung looks falsely affronted, hand over his chest and eyes innocent.\n\u201cWhat about-\u201c Jungkook begins to say, but Namjoon cuts him off with a growl of frustration.\n\u201cSilicone and water-based personal lubricants are similarly banned.\u201d\n\u201cWell there goes the break-room slip-and-slide,\u201d Taehyung mumbles discontentedly.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of working for a company that sells lube if we can\u2019t even play with it?\u201d Jimin pouts.\n\u201cWell, Jimin,\u201d Namjoon replies calmly, but his gaze is unfocused, dead. \u201cYou are here to make money in exchange for your labor. It is called a\u00a0job. Furthermore, we\u2019ve been over this. This company sells a wide variety of personal hygiene items, including, but not limited to, a personal lubricating ointment that can be used for anything from dry skin to-\u201d\n\u201cButtsex,\u201d Jungkook provides helpfully.\nNamjoon takes a very deep breath and seems to physically swallow his words, keeping his face carefully neutral.\n\u201cWhen\u2019s he coming?\u201d Hoseok asks from beside Yoongi. \u201cThe corporate guy?\u201d\nNamjoon hesitates, eyes flicking guiltily away. \u201cToday.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Jimin demands, looking slightly panicked. Taehyung leans over to whisper in his ear, and Jimin nods fervently.\n\u201cMay I please be excused?\u201d Taehyung asks with a strange, stilted politeness that reeks of desperation.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of a goddamn meeting, Tae. Why?\u201d\n\u201cI need to\u2026 attend to some things. Immediately,\u201d he responds evasively, leg jiggling anxiously like he\u2019s revving his engine, ready to bolt.\nNamjoon stares at the pair of them as they do their absolute damndest to look angelic. \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t even want to know. Go.\u201d Taehyung mutters a quick thanks and darts\u00a0out of the room in another vaguely Taehyung-shaped blur. \u201cAnd hurry, he\u2019ll be here any minute,\u201d Namjoon shouts after him before turning back to address everyone else once more. \u201cOkay, look guys. I\u2019m going to need somebody to cater to his every need. Kiss his ass. Convince him that everything is great, and get him out of our hair.\u201d\n\u201cNot it!\u201d Hoseok jumps in, slightly too loud. \u201cJust because I\u2019m Human Resources doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m the goddamn welcome committee. I am not paid to kiss ass.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the office director, Namjoon. Why don\u2019t\u00a0you\u00a0kiss his ass?\u201d Jimin asks, eyes darting nervously to the door like the intruder might pop in at any moment.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of principle,\u201d Namjoon argues, turning up his nose very slightly. \u201cI will not be a facilitator of corporate greed.\u201d\nYoongi exhales very hard though his nose in a semblance of a laugh. \u201cYou do realize you\u2019re like, a vital cog in the capitalist machinery that you so loathe, right?\u201d\n\u201cAnd thank you for volunteering, Yoongi,\u201d Namjoon says with a light smile, scribbling something down on the paper in front of him.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Yoongi says simply, his spine going rigid in indignation.\u00a0 \u201cI will not.\"\n\"Min....Yoongi... On-boarding Buddy,\" Namjoon mutters as he writes. When he's finished, he looks up at Yoongi with an innocent, dimpled smile.\n\"On-boarding Buddy?\" Yoongi balks in disdain, \"Look, I take it back. I'm sorry! You're a... victim of a rigged society. A true champion of the worker.\"\nNamjoon chuckles. \"Sorry, buddy. I'm just fucking with you,\" and Yoongi relaxes just slightly. \"I actually chose you for this long before now.\"\n\"Me?! Why?\"\n\"Because you two are already going to be working together on the budget and everything. It makes sense.\"\n\"I won't do it,\" Yoongi refuses point-blank, crossing his arms.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t, I\u2019m going to move your cubicle between Jimin\u2019s and Taehyung\u2019s again.\u201d\nYoongi blanches, mouth falling open as he leans forward in his chair. \u201cYou\u2019re bluffing.\u201d\n\u201cTry me,\u201d Namjoon declares bravely. \u201cYou can say goodbye to their isolation corner.\u201d\n\u201cHey, you said that was a special-super-awesome-sales-team-only corner,\u201d Jimin protests, jumping to his feet. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d\n\u201cIt is, it is,\u201d Namjoon assuages him with an appeasing expression, \u201cOf course it is.\u201d\nYoongi\u2019s about to protest further, but the door to the meeting room bursts open, bouncing several times against the wall as a sweaty Taehyung pokes his head inside, eyes desperate.\n\u201cJimin, Garbage is crowning!\u201d\nThere\u2019s a moment of confused silence where everyone seems to be trying to figure out exactly what they heard.\n\u201cWhat\u00a0is\u00a0what?\u201d Yoongi demands, puncturing the quiet, but Jimin has already disappeared out of the door behind Taehyung.\u00a0\n\u201cFive bucks says it\u2019s Dumpster Cat.\u201d Hoseok says, pushing himself wearily to his feet as Namjoon bangs his head gently against the table. \u201cKeep up, dude. You\u2019re a little slow today. I think we\u2019re about to witness a live cat birth.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve already seen two live cat births thanks to Kim Taehyung,\u201d Yoongi says distastefully. \u201cI\u2019m just gonna take my smoke break.\u201d\n\u201cSuit yourself. Do you want me to save you a kitten?\u201d\nYoongi scoffs, pulling a disgusted and incredulous face as he slips on his jacket. \u201cOf course I do not want you to save me a fucking kitten.\u201d\nHoseok fixes him with an incredulous stare, and Yoongi relents.\n\u201cGod, Hoseok, yes obviously save me a kitten. Shut up,\u201d he half-whispers, exasperated. Hoseok smiles knowingly and jogs lightly from the room to catch up with the others.\nThe smoking patio is a small deck on the third floor. It is completely exposed to the cold, harsh wind, uncovered and so cramped that Yoongi often finds himself rubbing elbows with workers from all over the building, different companies, different offices. So when he sees a new face, hunched over the railing and looking down at the parking lot below, it\u2019s nothing unusual. Yoongi sees new faces all the time.\nThe only unusual thing is that Yoongi\u00a0usually\u00a0doesn\u2019t care if he ever sees those faces again,\u00a0definitely\u00a0does not want to see them every day for the rest of forever, or perhaps in some really inappropriate dream-type situations. But there\u2019s a first time for everything.\nIt\u2019s the kind of face you might see on billboards or buses or cereal boxes, and seeing it in real life is a little jarring and a lot weird. He\u2019s soft, almost strangely so, his features opulent and curving but delicate, except for his eyebrows, two dark, straight slashes beneath a fine, smooth forehead.\u00a0 He\u2019s exquisitely lovely in the morning light, little golden rays criss-crossing behind his figure, looking so casually, effortlessly handsome that it\u2019s actually kind of fucking annoying.\nYoongi clears his throat and swaggers over to the balcony, trying to look as utterly bored as possible while simultaneously putting the maximum amount of distance between them. He pulls out his lighter and a cigarette with nervous hands, cursing inwardly, because his lighter has of course chosen this very inconvenient moment to die.\n\u201cNeed a light?\u201d\nYoongi resists the urge to flee, because yep that beautiful guy is talking to him. Looking him. Reaching forward, expensive silver lighter in hand, towards him. Yoongi briefly considers turning him down, but the prospect of continuing to make a fool of himself with his own damn lighter urges him to nod, small and silent. The guy smiles and leans closer yet, flicking on the lighter with practiced ease. As soon as his cigarette has caught, Yoongi is leaning away, nodding in acknowledgement.\n\u201cThanks,\u201d he grunts shortly, and god damn it he sounds like a cave man.\n\u201cMy pleasure,\u201d the guy replies, pocketing his lighter and smiling in a way that has Yoongi shifting nervously and looking away. \u201cGood thing I was here, eh? This place is deserted. I guess it\u2019s a little early for a smoke break.\u201d\nYoongi raises his eyebrow as flicks the ashes from the end of his cigarette, hoping that the pause he takes as he mentally prepares himself to sound casual comes across as relaxed. \u201cThere is currently a cat giving birth in a file cabinet upstairs. It wouldn\u2019t be too early for a drink.\u201d\n\u201cYour boss is okay with that? The uh\u2026 cat birth?\u201d asks the guy, perfectly tailored suit sitting sinfully well on his wide shoulders. He looks frightfully out of place in this frumpy hellhole of a building, where most guys can\u2019t even be bothered to tuck in their cheap, ill-fitting dress shirts.\nMust work for that law firm on the fifth floor.\n\u201cHow do you know I\u2019m not the boss?\u201d Yoongi demands, straightening himself up to his full height. His nose bobs proudly just above the guy\u2019s shoulder.\nThe man raises his eyebrows skeptically. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem like a boss.\u201d\nYoongi shrugs, once again flicking the ashes off of the end of his cigarette without taking a puff. \u201cFair. You couldn\u2019t pay me enough to be the boss of those assholes, anyway. Namjoon\u2019s already going a little gray.\u201d\nThose striking, straight eyebrows curve upwards a little in surprise. \u201cKim Namjoon?\u201d\n\u201cThe one and only,\u201d Yoongi confirms. He\u2019s not surprised. Everyone in the building knows about their office. They know, and they keep their distance.\n\u201cSounds like you all have an interesting office dynamic,\u201d the man says with a wry smile.\nYoongi just shrugs again, stealing a glance from the corner of his eye. The guy\u2019s looking at him kind of intensely, and it stirs his already sensitive stomach with an added dose of anxiety. He nervously shakes his hair from his eyes and tucks his head silently.\n\u201cYou guys ever get any work done? You know, between litters?\u201d\n\u201cWe do okay. Obviously not good enough for those jerk-offs at corporate, but we do okay,\u201d Yoongi replies, his voice laced with a lazy, simmering spite. He doesn\u2019t know why he\u2019s saying a goddamn thing about it, except that he just kind of wants this guy to keep talking to him. The man straightens up beside him.\n\u201cOh?\u201d\nYoongi hesitates for only a moment, taken off guard by his own loose lips. \u201cThey\u2019re sending in a fucking baby-sitter to tell us how to do our jobs.\u201d\n\u201cAh, an efficiency expert?\u201d\nYoongi glares a little at nothing in particular. \u201cA professional wet blanket.\u201d\n\u201cHow\u2019s that going over? In the office?\u201d\n\u201cThat bastard\u2019s gonna have his work cut out for him.\u201d Yoongi gives a short, satisfied laugh at the thought.\n\u201cHow so?\u201d\nYoongi considers carefully for a moment. \u201cYou know how back in school, people would always try and pull shit on substitute teachers? Tell them the wrong names and put thumbtacks on their chairs and try to get away with murder by claiming that their regular teacher usually lets them do it?\u201d\n\u201cYeah?\u201d the guy prompts him, his lovely features arranged into an almost comical expression of disbelief.\n\u201cImagine that, plus lube.\u201d\n\u201cLube?\u201d the man asks, looking clearly convinced that he had heard wrongly.\n\u201cIndustrial-sized containers of lube.\u201d Yoongi makes sure to maintain intense eye contact and really emphasize the word\u00a0lube,\u00a0but the guy looks strangely unshaken. \u201cI mean, it probably doesn\u2019t hurt that we sell it and so they have pretty consistent access to the product. But I think you would be surprised how many separate and unrelated lube-based incidents it is possible to have in one workplace.\u201d\n\u201cI daren\u2019t even guess,\u201d the guy says with an amused smile.\n\u201cSeven,\u201d Yoongi informs him. \u201cSeven independent lube incidents. All different.\u201d\n\u201cImpressive,\u201d he admits, and Yoongi just now notices that he\u2019s not even smoking. \u201cThat must take some creativity.\u201d\n\u201cYou have no idea.\u201d\n\u201cWait, wait. Let me try,\u201d the guy offers, not missing a beat, biting his beautiful plump lower lip in careful though. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta have the classic lubed doorknobs and lubed toilet seats.\u201d He pauses for a moment, scanning Yoongi\u2019s face before continuing. \u201cJudging by your expression, it was you who went for a little swim courtesy of that one.\u201d\nYoongi makes a noise of incredulous outrage.\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m assuming there\u2019s been some kind of lube wrestling incident. Another classic, both sexy and ridiculous, and extremely work inappropriate. That one\u2019s easy, though. How about\u2026 lube in the soap dispensers. Gross and unexpected. OH. Slip and slide. Duh.\u201d\nIt\u2019s like he\u2019s reading straight from the damn incident reports themselves, and by the time he finishes, Yoongi is looking at him like he has just seen a horse with three dicks. He is also slightly in love and rather distraught about it. \u201cWho\u00a0are\u00a0you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m Kim Seokjin,\u201d the man introduced himself, extending his hand. Yoongi takes it hesitantly, halfway convinced that he never woke up this morning, that he\u2019s still dreaming, that he\u2019s not actually living this weird fucking day.\n\u201cUh huh,\u201d Yoongi replies vaguely and skeptically, face incredulous even as his heart gallops away at breakneck speed. Seokjin smiles at him then, and he knows he\u2019s dreaming, floating away into the nothingness above him. But then he realizes how sweaty his hand is in Seokjin\u2019s grip, and nope, he\u2019s definitely awake. He wrenches his hand away abruptly.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\u201cYoongi,\u201d he responds uncertainly, appraising Seokjin through apprehensive, narrowed eyes. He\u2019s still not really sure that any of this is real.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, Yoongi.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s definitely\u2026 a thing.\u201d\n\u201cAnyway, don\u2019t you feel kinda bad for this poor guy? This efficiency expert?\u201d Seokjin continues. \u201cIsn\u2019t he just doing his job?\u201d\n\u201cEh, he probably goes around laying off innocent old grandmas and slashing vital funds from budgets and jizzing himself over his little power trip. He gets paid to have a stick up his ass.\u201d\n\u201cGood thing you guys sell lube.\u201d\nYoongi cracks a small smile despite himself, extinguishing his cigarette on the railing without having taken a single drag. \u201cThe point is, he probably deserves what\u2019s coming to him.\u201d\n\u201cProbably,\u201d Seokjin allows with a small, wry smile. \u201cWell, I\u2019m actually kind of late, so I\u2019ve got to get going. But hey, give him hell. I\u2019ll see you around?\u201d Seokjin\u2019s smile is far too self-satisfied, and Yoongi\u2019s stomach bubbles in annoyance again.\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d\u00a0 If there is a God.\nYoongi would be a little sorry to see him go, if the back view wasn\u2019t so excellent. He cranes his head as Seokjin retreats back into the building, and Yoongi would like the shake the hand of the tailor that sculpted those pants around that ass.\nHis mind is still wandering when he arrives back upstairs. It\u2019s so rare that Yoongi is even remotely interested in someone that he feels like he\u2019s in college again. Back then, it had been Taehyung, before he\u2019d actually gotten know Taehyung. Thank\u00a0God\u00a0he\u2019d actually gotten to know Taehyung.\nJust inside the door of their office, he meets Hoseok on his way out of the bathroom, wiping his hands on his pants with a sickened look on his face.\n\u201cI swear there\u2019s still lube residue in those soap dispensers. I\u2019m all slippery,\u201d Hoseok grumbles, furiously rubbing his right hand against the fabric on his ass. \u201cAnd right when the guy from corporate gets here, too. Fuck.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s here?\u201d Yoongi questions, trying to peer around the corner into the conference room, from which a soft but excited buzz is emanating.\nHoseok opens his mouth to respond, but he is interrupted by Taehyung, barreling out into the hallway and grasping desperately onto the sleeves of Yoongi\u2019s shirt. He takes a few steadying breaths before he can manage to speak. \u201cHe\u2019s\u2026 so\u2026 hot.\u201d\nIt\u2019s that feeling he used to get when the bell rang for class and he realized he had homework the night before. When he remembered that rent was due 6 days ago. When he let his mom borrow his computer and suddenly realized that he never closed out of his porn.\nHe sees the look in Tae\u2019s eyes. He guesses it was a little something like the look in his own just a few minutes ago, down on the smoking balcony.\n\u201cReally?\u201d Hoseok asks, clearly surprised. Yoongi swallows down the vomit that he feels bubbling\u00a0up in his throat. \u201cHow hot?\u201d\n\u201cSo\u2026 hot,\u201d Taehyung emphasizes. \u201cNot old at all. Michelangelo\u2019s David, but with better hair and probably a bigger dick. No, definitely a bigger dick. Those pants\u2026\u201d\nYoongi\u2019s seen too many bad rom-coms, been dragged to too movie nights at Jimin and Taehyung\u2019s place to not know what happens next.\nAnd so he emerges, every part the David 2.0 that Taehyung had described, looking even taller and broader than before with his arm slung around Jimin\u2019s tiny shoulders. They\u2019re laughing.\n\u201cI take back everything I said,\u201d Hoseok mutters to Yoongi, jaw slack as he stares at the approaching pair. \u201cI would pay good fucking money to kiss that ass.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were into dudes,\u201d Taehyung says quizzically.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t either, but I would let him bend me over a desk and make a strong argument for it.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re like 2 seconds from having to file a Human Resources violation against yourself.\u201d Taehyung informs Hoseok helpfully. \u201cAgain.\u201d\n\u201cWorth it,\u201d Hoseok assures him, quiet now that Seokjin and Jimin are approaching. Jimin looks positively gleeful.\u00a0 Yoongi would normally take this opportunity to roll his eyes, but at the present moment, they are locked unwaveringly on Kim Seokjin, who is looking right back at him, just as smug as the movies suggest that he should be.\n\u201cThis is Hoseok, our HR guy,\u201d Jimin informs Seokjin as they come to a stop in front of where they are gathered. \u201cAn interesting choice on Namjoon\u2019s part, if you ask me.\u201d\n\u201cGood thing nobody asked you,\u201d Hoseok growls, before flashing a small smile over at Seokjin.\n\u201cAnd this is Yoongi,\u201d Jimin continues like he hasn\u2019t heard him. \u201cHe\u2019s our\u2026 entire accounting department, actually. Yoongi, this is Kim Seokjin, from Corporate.\u201d\n\u201cHello\u00a0Kim Seokjin\u00a0from\u00a0Corporate,\u201d Yoongi growls lowly, and Jimin\u2019s eyes bug slightly in response to the venom in his voice.\n\u201cYou can just call me Jin. And it\u2019s a pleasure to see you again so soon, Yoongi.\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cAgain?\u201d Taehyung prompts him, brows furrowed in confusion \u201cSo soon?\u201d\n\u201cWe met downstairs just now. Yoongi gave me a little run-down of the branch.\u201d\n\u201cYou what?\u201d Taehyung demands, spinning to face Yoongi.\n\u201cThis is what I get,\u201d Yoongi mutters emotionlessly, fingers massaging gently at his temples. \u201cThe one time I speak to a person.\u201d\n\u201cHe was extremely helpful,\u201d Jin assures them. \u201cVery welcoming.\u201d\nTaehyung and Jimin stare at Jin blankly for a moment before Jimin speaks. \u201cWho was?\u201d\n\u201cYoongi.\u201d\n\u201cYoongi was what?\u201d Taehyung demands, obvious confused.\n\u201cExtremely helpful and very welcoming,\u201d Jin reiterates.\n\u201cWho was?\u201d Jimin repeats, and Yoongi is mentally banging his head against the file cabinet.\n\u201cYoongi was.\u201d\n\u201cYoongi was what?\u201d Jimin asks quizzically.\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell if you guys are serious or not,\u201d Jin admits, backing away slightly.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a skill that comes with time,\u201d Hoseok informs him off-handedly. \u201cBut sorry, actually can we go back to the part about Yoongi being helpful and welcoming?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you know,\u201d Jin starts, eyes sparkling impishly and gloriously in the ugly florescent light, \u201cI was kind of nervous about coming in here and inserting myself abruptly into the situation, but I think Yoongi really\u2026 lubricated this whole transition for me, prepped me well for my entrance to this branch.\u201d\nJimin subtly elbows a snorting Taehyung subtly at the word \u2018lubricated,\u2019 and Yoongi blanches a little. Jin\u2019s eyes are sparkling gleefully.\n\u201cWhat can I say? I\u2019m a considerate guy,\u201d Yoongi confirms, tight-lipped as he stares intently, warningly at Jin. He can feel Hoseok silently questioning him through his gaze.\n\u201cThis job can be rough, you know,\u201d Jin continues, and he sounds like he\u2019s having way too much fun. \u201cI usually meet a lot of resistance, have to work my way into things slowly and carefully. And I\u2019m always worried that it won\u2019t be a good\u00a0fit, that it\u2019ll be a painful adjustment. But thanks to Yoongi, this whole thing has been a very pleasurable experience. I think I\u2019m going to be able to slide right in.\u201d\nJimin and Taehyung glance back and forth between the two of them, between Jin\u2019s charming, easy smile and Yoongi\u2019s carefully blank expression, which very nearly succeeds in hiding his massive unease.\n\u201cThis is weird. This got weird. We\u2019re gonna go,\u201d Taehyung tells them very clearly, tugging Jimin away. When Hoseok doesn\u2019t move to leave, Taehyung adds, \u201cAren\u2019t you coming?\u201d\n\u201cI think I\u2019m gonna stay and see how this plays out,\u201d Hoseok replies slowly, gaze still trained on Jin\u2019s face. Hoseok is appraising him very carefully, eyes squinted in consideration. \u201cYou have\u2026 quite a way with words, Seokjin.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re literally the worst HR guy ever,\u201d Taehyung informs him as his own hand wanders down to gently cup Jimin\u2019s butt to usher him away. They all hear a door click shut down the hall a few moments later.\n\u201cHe\u2019s joking,\u201d Hoseok assures Jin with an oily smile. \u201cWe joke because we\u2019re close.\u201d\n\u201cHoseok, come help me with these damn cats!\u201d Namjoon\u2019s desperate voice comes from down the hall. \u201cI can\u2019t find Jimin and Taehyung.\u201d\n\u201cThey just walked your way less than 10 seconds ago,\u201d Hoseok shouts right back. \u201cThere is absolutely no way you could have missed them, unless they\u2019re in the supply closet.\u201d He pauses for a moment \u201cActually, they\u2019re probably in the supply closet. They\u2019ve been taking inventory of the sample stock a lot in there lately, like twice a day. Which is weird, because that\u2019s not even their job.\u201d\n\u201cJust get your ass in here!\u201d Namjoon\u2019s voice cracks mid-shout.\u00a0\n\u201cFine,\u201d Hoseok grumbles, face brightening a little when he turns to Yoongi. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I saved you the best cat, Yoongi. Garbage\u2019s favorite. It\u2019s got a heart-shaped patch of white fur around its asshole and it keeps trying to smother its siblings with its body. I call her Murderer.\u201d\n\u201cYou guys are very literal with the names, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Jin offers quietly.\nHoseok bursts out into obviously fake laughter and slaps Jin gleefully on the back, and Yoongi rolls his eyes so hard that it hurts. Hoseok\u2019s laughter ceases abruptly as his hand comes to rest on Seokjin\u2019s upper arm, gripping it tightly. \u201cOh, you work out, don\u2019t you?\n\u201cHOSEOK.\u201d Namjoon\u2019s voice reverberates down the hallway.\n\u201cFINE,\u201d Hoseok screams so loudly that he startles Yoongi and Jin slightly, storming down the hallway after one last lingering look at Jin, leaving the two of them standing there, simmering in their strange tension.\n\u201cYou. Bastard,\u201d Yoongi spits bitterly once Hoseok is out of sight, \u201cWhat the hell are you trying to do?\u201d\n\u201cOh come on, I was just messing around. I didn\u2019t even tell them anything you said. No harm done.\u201d\n\u201cNo harm done??\u201d Yoongi demands, exploding in indignation. \u201cNot only has my reputation been permanently marred by this \u2018helpful and welcoming\u2019 bullshit, but there is no earthly way that they didn\u2019t catch those very thinly veiled lube allusions. They have to know I warned you. I am an informant. A traitor to my own.\u201d\nJin just smiles indulgently. \u201cYou\u2019re cute.\u201d\nYoongi gapes indignantly. \u201cI am NO such thing.\u201d\n\u201cHey seriously though,\u201d Jin continues like Yoongi hasn\u2019t spoken, \u201cI owe you for the heads-up. I adjusted my initial approach based on everything you told me, and I think it worked. I think the guys are cool.\u201d\n\u201cI cannot believe you purposefully extracted information from me,\u201d Yoongi pouts.\n\u201cYou were pretty damn talkative on all on your own.\u201d\nYoongi splutters in outrage, ears hot. \u201cOnly because you were so-\u2026\u201d He breaks off abruptly, tugging his jacket tight around himself, and Jin bites back an amused giggle, pursing\u00a0his lip to keep from smiling. \u201cI feel violated.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be dramatic. Look, the opportunity basically fell into my lap. You would have done the same thing.\u201d\n\u201cI think you\u2019re my enemy now. I\u2019ve never had an enemy before,\u201d Yoongi ponders aloud.\n\u201cSo you\u2019re not gonna go the \u2018don\u2019t be dramatic,\u2019 route. Noted.\u201d\nJust then, a flustered-looking Namjoon emerges from the breakroom, scrubbing violently at a spot on his shirt.\n\u201cYOUR cat pissed on me,\u201d he jabs an accusatory finger at Yoongi.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t even met my cat,\u201d Yoongi mutters defensively.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe those two assholes ditched me after they caused this whole mess. Do you know that cat\u2019s been living here for a month? It looks like the isolation corner backfired. Too much privacy. I\u2019m getting rid of their cubicles altogether.\u201d\n\u201cIf you think a lack of walls will alter their behavior at all, you clearly haven\u2019t met them,\u201d Yoongi tells him as he heaves a deep sigh.\n\u201cOh, speaking of cubicles\u2026\u201d Namjoon starts, and Yoongi knows it\u2019s bad news by the tightness of his voice and the way he\u2019s avoiding eye contact.\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Yoongi sits moodily in his chair Tuesday, arms crossed, glaring hard at nothing in particular as Jungkook carefully works on removing Yoongi\u2019s computer and phone from his old cubicle.\n\u201cJesus Yoongi, don\u2019t look so fucking wounded,\u201d comes Hoseok\u2019s voice from over his cubicle wall. Yoongi knows that if he turned his head, he would see a the top of Hoseok\u2019s head bobbing up over the grayish padded panel. \u201cBoo hoo, you have to move cubes to go and sit beside the most beautiful human being that has ever existed. I\u2019m so fucking sorry.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s my sworn enemy,\u201d Yoongi mutters. \u201cHow dare he. Nobody pulls that shit on me.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re such a baby. All he did was listen to your whiny, lust-motivated rambling, and now you've transformed into every part the enraged toddler that your size and general appearance have always suggested that you are.\u201d\n\u201cYOU are supposed to be on MY side,\u201d Yoongi exclaims in outrage, straightening up from his slumped position in his chair.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been on your side,\u201d Hoseok assures him, \u201cUp until now. I\u2019m very sorry. I think I understand the Trojan War now.\u201d\n\u201cWhy is there a pillow back here?\u201d comes Jungkook\u2019s slightly muffed voice from where he is bent underneath Yoongi\u2019s desk, only his backside visible. Yoongi resists the urge to give it a swift kick. \u201cHoly shit, there\u2019s a whole little nest. Do you\u00a0sleep\u00a0under here?\u201d\nYoongi ignores him. \u201cHe\u2019s taken you all in with his good looks and his sparkling personality and his homemade scones, but one day you will realize. And by then it\u2019ll be too late. You\u2019ll find me in the supply closet, drowned. In the lube.\u201d\n\u201cPeople think you\u2019re so chill, but you are like the least chill person I know. And I work in\u00a0this\u00a0office.\u201d\n\u201cFuck you.\u201d\nHis new cube is in what used to be Jimin and Taehyung\u2019s special corner, the entrance directly across from the entrance of Jin\u2019s soon-to-be work area. If he peeks up over the edge of his wall, he can see the resident troublemakers\u2019 new place of residence, two desks smack dab in the middle of the room, completely exposed to the rest of the office. As Yoongi suspected, they seem utterly unconcerned by this new lack of privacy. Jimin sits casually on his desk as Taehyung feeds him what seems to be cold spaghetti with his fingers.\n\u201cHow long have they been a thing?\u201d\nYoongi doesn\u2019t turn to greet him but keeps his eyes trained on the pair in front of him. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cJimin and Taehyung. How have they been together?\u201d\nYoongi spares him a disgusted look. Jin\u2019s hands are full with a box of his things. Yoongi looks away, doing his best to appear utterly bored. \u201cWhat are you talking about? They\u2019re not.\u201d\nTaehyung lifts one end of a noodle to his mouth and sets the other end between Jimin\u2019s lips, inching closer and closer as they both nibble towards the center.\n\u201cWhat are YOU talking about?\u201d Jin demands. \u201cThey\u2019re like Lady and the Tramp over there. \u2018A Thing\u2019 if I ever saw one.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re just close. Everybody knows that.\u201d\n\u201cOkay so what do you call that?\u201d Jin asks, gesturing with his head to the brofest.\n\u201cTeambuilding.\u201d\n\u201cHow is this shit even allowed?\u201d Jin wonders aloud, setting wandering over to his cube and setting his box down on the desk.\n\u201cOur HR guy is Hoseok.\u201d\n\u201cThis is the weirdest place they\u2019ve ever sent me. And one of the sales reps at my last place made me a doll of myself with my own hair,\u201d he mutters, only his head visible over the partial wall. \u201cBut you know what? I was taking a look at the numbers, and the sales are insanely good. I don\u2019t know how Jimin and Taehyung do it, honestly. How is this branch not rolling in it?\u201d\n\u201cIf we knew that, you wouldn\u2019t be here, would you?\u201d Yoongi busies himself with a spreadsheet that he finished two days ago, but he can still feel Jin\u2019s eyes on his face.\n\u201cHey-uh,\u201d Jin starts, voice suddenly unnaturally high, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry we got off on the wrong foot.\u201d\nYoongi\u2019s head jerks in Jin\u2019s direction instinctively. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI should have told you who I was. What I did was shady. Hilarious but shady.\u201d\nYoongi glares hard at his computer screen, ready to neither accept nor reject the apology. \u201cHow long are you here for anyway?\u201d\n\u201cTwo months? Three months? Maybe longer. This place is kind of a mess. Depends on how fast we work.\u201d\n\u201cInteresting. Very interesting.\u201d\nYoongi\u2019s eyebrows crumple in confusion, because neither of them have spoken. There is a moment of silence before Yoongi jumps in shock as he sees the two pairs of impish eyes staring back at him from over his cubicle wall.\n\u201cWhat the hell? Where did you guys come from?\u201d Yoongi demands, doing his best not to sound out of breath.\n\u201cWe were done with lunch,\u201d Jimin says simply.\n\u201cSo what you\u2019re saying, Jin,\u201d Taehyung jumps in, voice dripping with mischievousness, \u201cis that the slower you two get shit done, the longer you\u2019re here? Working with Yoongi?\u201d\n\u201cUh, yeah? I guess?\u201d Jin confirms uncertainly, leaning against his and Yoongi\u2019s shared wall.\n\u201cInteresting\u2026 very interesting,\u201d Taehyung repeats, and Jimin accompanying giggle is disturbingly amused.\nThe blood drains from Yoongi\u2019s face so rapidly that he actually feels it happening. \u201cDon\u2019t...\u201d he manages weakly.\n\u201cVeryyyy interesting,\u201d Jimin seconds with a vicious, serrated giggle.\nYoongi knows that the more he fights, the more likely they are to latch onto whatever idea they\u2019re cooking up this time, to dig their heels in unrelentingly.\n\u201cWill you two just go away? Don\u2019t you have kittens to be tending or something?\u201d Yoongi says as calmly as he is able. They can smell fear.\n\u201cGarbage is a wonderful mother. She doesn\u2019t need our help. Plus, we need to allow her time to bond with her children,\u201d Taehyung informs him coolly. \u201cMurderer is still trying to smother her siblings, though. You should really speak to her about that.\u201d\n\u201cIs that cat, by chance, still on company premises?\u201d Jin casually inquires.\n\u201cWhaaaaaaat?\u201d Jimin asks with a stiff, cheesy smile, waving off Jin\u2019s question with a dismissive hand. \u201cPfffft.\u201d\n\u201cSo\u2026 no?\u201d Jin tries to clarify.\nJimin\u2019s smile flickers for just the briefest second before it\u2019s back, brighter than ever. \u201cWhaaaaaaaaat?\u201d\n\u201cThat means no, right?\u201d Jin asks, slightly more forceful this time.\n\u201cBye,\u201d Jimin says abruptly, ducking below the cubicle wall and disappearing from sight. Taehyung is gone just a moment later.\n\u201cWhat is this\u2026 this, like, heavy, foreboding feeling in my stomach?\u201d Jin mutters, craning his head to try and get a view of their fleeing figures.\n\u201cDread?\u201d Yoongi supplies for him. \u201cOh yeah, you\u2019ll get used to that.\u201d\n\u201cCan you please explain to me how the company managed to spend $1300 last year on the website adamandeve.com?\u201d\nYoongi leans over to get a look at the expense report, careful to preserve a certain distance between them, pointedly ignoring the enticing smell of freshly-baked pastries that is emanating from Jin. \u201cThis says it was for \u2018team building.\u2019 Checked out to me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it with you guys and \u2018team building\u2019?\u201d Jin mumbles, tossing the paper aside carelessly and plucking up another. \u201cJesus. Okay,\u201d he clears his throat, scooting his chair closer to Yoongi, who stiffens and leans as far away as he can. \u201cA potato gun. Seriously?\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019ll look, that one is marked under \u2018company security.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cAnd how is that working out for you guys?\u201d\n\u201cGreat,\u201d Yoongi assures him, \u201cJust last month, Jungkook almost\u00a0nailed this stray raccoon that wandered into the building.\u201d\n\u201cThis place is unreal,\u201d Jin marvels, shaking his head as he digs deeper into the pile. \u201cYoongi. This receipt is for Sandals. That is a couples resort.\u201d\nYoongi peeks over, grabbing the paper out of his hands. \u201cNo, Taehyung and Jimin marked it as \u2018sales trip.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cThey ordered porn to the room and expensed us for it.\u201d\n\u201cLook, I don\u2019t know what you want me to say,\u201d Yoongi heaves a great, exhausted sigh. \u201cI do not have the time to pore over every detail of every expense.\u201d\n\u201cAre you telling me you didn\u2019t even look at the receipts?\u201d Jin demands, clearly flustered, holding up handfuls of papers in disbelief.\nYoongi sits up straighter, and if humans had hackles, his would be at full attention. \u201cYou know what? When you assholes\u00a0at Corporate decide to give us the funds to hire another accountant, maybe there will be time to look at the goddamn receipts. I mean, do you know everything that I have to do? I handle big-picture accounting. Sales numbers, projections, budgets. I handle day-to-day accounting. Payroll, expense reports, ordering inventory and supplies. Then on top of that, I am responsible for compiling all of that data and sending it off to corporate each month so they can send in a fucking baby-sitter to tell me I\u2019m not doing my goddamn job.\u201d\n\u201cWhoa whoa whoa,\u201d Jin waves his hands in a manner that is clearly meant to calm him, obviously a little shocked at Yoongi\u2019s outburst. \u201cI get it. I\u2019m sorry, I wasn\u2019t\u2026 accusing. I\u2019m just\u2026 Have you ever voiced your concerns to Corporate? About needing another accountant?\u201d Jin pries gently, looking vaguely disgusted with the papers in his hands.\nYoongi scoffs viciously. \u201cOnly every quarter for the last two years. I doubt they even read my suggestions, though. They only look at the damn numbers.\u201d\n\u201cI had no clue,\u201d Jin marvels, looking at the mess of papers in front of him. \u201cThis is too much work for anyone. Like, I can\u2019t believe this branch is even afloat. You\u2019re kind of awesome, Yoongi.\u201d\nYoongi tucks his head, the neck of his dress shirt feeling very tight and hot all of a sudden. \u201cYeah, well, tell that to your corporate overlords.\u201d\n\u201cI will,\u201d Jin assures him with a soft smile. \u201cYou know, this branch actually still brings in more money than the other branches. When I say your sales numbers are insane, I mean it. We were just stunned by the discrepancy in sales and actual profit. But if we straightened out this accounting issue and brought some law and order to this place, I think we could break some records.\u201d\nYoongi chances a glance out of the corner of his eye and instantly regrets it, because Jin\u2019s face is alight with enthusiasm and sincerity, like he is truly, personally invested, and Yoongi is bitterly and absolutely smitten.\n\u201cI\u2019m really sorry we dropped the ball on you, Yoongi. But we\u2019ll figure this out. Starting with\u2026. trying to salvage this year\u2019s budget.\u201d He picks up another piece of paper, then sets it down, eyes strangely blank. \u201c400 Chicken McNuggets, and for \u2018reason,\u2019 it just has down here \u2018social experiment.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cOkay, wait,\u00a0that\u00a0one I caught. I told Taehyung no, and he said he got a full refund.\u201d\nJin buries his head in his hands, and Yoongi hears a sad little groan. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure McDonalds has a no-return policy, Yoongi. Mother fucking Kim Taehyung.\u201d\n\u201cUm. I\u2019m\u2026 just gonna come back\u2026 later,\u201d Taehyung\u2019s voice comes from behind them, at the entrance of the conference room. He backs away nervously.\n\u201cNo, no, come in Taehyung. What do you need?\u201d Jin asks, sounding like a burdened single father of 12.\n\u201cI just need to drop off this expense report?\u201d he says uncertainly, with a tight, forced smile. \u201cIt\u2019s already been approved,\u201d he says hastily. \u201cYoongi signed off on it earlier this week.\u201d\nYoongi can almost feel the intensity of the suspicion in Jin\u2019s ensuing side-eye. \u201cHey, I\u2019ve been a lot more careful since you got here,\u201d he claims defensively. \u201cIt\u2019s probably legit.\u201d He pauses to think. \u201cProbably.\u201d\nTaehyung delivers the papers to Jin\u2019s outstretched hand and then backs away several steps. \u201cTrophies?\u201d Jin reads off of the paper, clearly confused. \u201cWhat could we possibly need trophies for?\u201d\n\u201cOur end-of-the-year awards,\u201d Taehyung pipes in with his usual blinding smile. \u201cThe Jammies.\u201d\n\u201cCome on guys,\u201d Jin exclaims in exasperation. \u201cThis is a business, not a high school. This is exactly the kind of thing they sent me here to stop.\u201d\n\u201cNo, you can\u2019t stop the Jammies!\u201d Taehyung exclaims in dismay. \u201cIt\u2019s tradition!\u201d\n\u201cIt is kind of our thing,\u201d Yoongi admits, shrinking back in his chair under Jin\u2019s ensuing glare.\n\u201cAnd we can totally justify the expense!\u201d Taehyung continues enthusiastically, jabbing his finger at a specific place on the report in Seokjin\u2019s hands. \u201cLook, I wrote down the reason as-\u201d\n\u201cIf this says team building, I\u2019m going to make you eat this goddamn paper,\u201d Jin warns with a deadly calm.\nTaehyung freezes, eyes wide and fearful, then he glacially slips the paper from between Jin\u2019s fingers, crumbling it up into a little ball and stuffing it in his mouth obediently. Jin just makes a disgusted face but doesn\u2019t comment otherwise.\n\u201cI assume you\u2019ve already bought the trophies? Personalized, and unreturnable?\u201d\nTaehyung nods silently, the corner of the paper sticking out from the side of his mouth.\nJin exhales hard through his nose. \u201cThen I guess we don\u2019t have any choice this year. But consider this the last Jammies. I\u2019m sorry, guys.\u201d\nTaehyung looks torn but resigned. \u201cOohHay,\u201d he mumbles around the wad of paper, a little trickle of drool seeping down his chin.\n\u201cAnd I am going to need that expense report,\u201d Jin says, gesturing to Taehyung\u2019s mouth. Taehyung makes to pull it out, but Jin hurriedly grabs his wrist to stop him. \u201cFor the love of god, please print a new one.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEven in the brisk, harsh winter, the smoking deck is greener and lusher than anything Yoongi has seen all day. There are a few hearty bushes and evergreen trees, as well as some seasonal poinsettias braving the inhospitable cold, and they make him feel strangely hopeful.\nIt\u2019s his safe place.\n\u201cHey,\u201d he hears from behind him, and it takes every ounce of self-restraint not to whip his head around. But he recognizes the voice, and he\u2019ll be damned if he exhibits human emotions like surprise in front of\u00a0that\u00a0bastard.\nIt was\u00a0his safe place.\n\u201cHey,\u201d he responds nonchalantly, leaning forward on the railing and trying his very hardest to not look like a fucking nerd.\n\u201cWhat are you doing out here?\u201d Jin asks casually, joining him at the railing. Yoongi slides a few inches to the right, away from danger.\n\u201cSmoking,\u201d Yoongi responds moodily before realizing that he left his cigarettes upstairs. Fuck.\n\u201cOh. Aren\u2019t you gonna, you know, smoke then?\u201d\nYoongi flushes red. \u201cI\u2026 think I forgot my cigarettes,\u201d Yoongi admits grudgingly.\u00a0\n\u201cI would offer you one of mine, but I don\u2019t smoke,\u201d Jin says, settling more of his weight forward against the rail.\n\u201cWhat are you talking about? We literally met on the smoking deck.\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t down here smoking,\u201d Jin clarifies. \u201cI was getting some air. I just find that it\u2019s good practice to always carry a lighter. You never know when you might run into some poor schmuck in need of a light and willing to air his company\u2019s dirty laundry.\u201d\nYoongi seethes quietly, scrambling for a biting retort and coming up empty. After a couple of seconds of silence, Jin continues.\n\u201cCome to think of it, you weren\u2019t smoking last time, either,\u201d Jin observes, and Yoongi flushes with embarrassment and with pleasure that Jin had been paying such close attention to him. \u201cYou just let the cigarette burn down.\u201d\n\u201cYeah well,\u201d Yoongi blusters suddenly, \u201cLast time\u00a0I was distracted.\u201d When Jin raises his eyebrows significantly in response, Yoongi backtracks, \u201cNot like,\u00a0distracted\u00a0distracted. Y-you just wouldn\u2019t shut up\u2026\u201d\nJin doesn\u2019t sway. \u201cYou don\u2019t actually smoke, do you?\u201d\nYoongi exhales hard through his nose. \u201cNo I do not actually smoke, and if you ever tell anyone, so help me god, I will end you.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you go out of your way to pretend, then?\u201d\n\u201cSo motherfuckers like you don\u2019t talk to me when I\u2019m trying to relax. Because when I smoke I look all, like- I dunno- edgy and dangerous, so people leave me alone.\u201d He shoots Jin an unsubtle glare from the corner of his eye. \u201cUsually,\u201d he amends.\nJin actually stifles a laugh. \u201cEdgy and dangerous? You look like that smoking baby from the internet.\u201d\n\u201cYou know, if you\u2019re trying to get us back on the right foot this is not the best way to go about it,\u201d Yoongi growls, swallowing down his anger as Jin laughs gleefully in response.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry. I couldn\u2019t resist,\u201d Jin apologizes with a lovely smile. \u201cYou are unbelievably fun to tease.\u201d\nYoongi has the strangest automatic urge to say \u2018Thank you,\u2019 but he bites it back, because that would not actually make one shred of sense. They sit there in benign silence, watching the traffic below the building crawl slowly and loudly down the packed street.\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s the only fucking break I get.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Jin asks, clearly not suspecting to have gotten an actual answer.\nYooni\u2019s ears are aflame, and he nervously shakes his bangs over his forehead. \u201cI pretend to smoke because it\u2019s the only fucking break I get.\u201d\n\u201cYou can take a break without taking a smoke break,\u201d Jin informs him matter-of-factly. \u201cWe do, in fact, have an actual break room.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but\u2026\u201d Yoongi starts, then thinks better of it, shaking his head and leaning forward on the railing.\n\u201cYeah but?\u201d Jin prompts him.\nYoongi hesitates for only a moment, and here he is, talking again. He can\u2019t ever seem to stop talking. \u201cIt\u2019s the only time I ever see green,\u201d he explains quietly, self-consciously gesturing minutely towards the terrace greenery. \u201cThe only reminder that the color green even exists. You know, beyond the endless seas of padded, gray, chemically-treated half-walls.\u201d\nJin nods silently a few times, chewing on his goddamn lip again. \u00a0\u201cEverybody copes in different ways. Just look at your friends.\u201d\nYoongi allows himself a gruff almost-chuckle at that. \u201cThey\u00a0definitely\u00a0know how to break up the monotony.\u201d\n\u201cThat they do.\u201d\nA horn honks insistently on the street below as Yoongi squirms and struggles in his own unsettling cloud of anxiety.\u00a0\u201cWhat do you do?\u201d he asks impulsively, wishing he could swallow the words as soon as they leave his mouth. He doesn\u2019t know why he said it, except that he\u2019s not quite ready for Jin to stop talking to him. \u201cUh, to cope?\u201d\n\u201cI move,\u201d Jin replies simply, stretching out his arms on the railing and leaning low to arch his back, groaning luxuriously at the stretch.\u00a0 \u201cI like to move.\u201d He straightens up abruptly then, posture once again impeccable as he turns to Yoongi. \u201cInteresting fact: Everywhere\u2019s gray. Everywhere they send me. Every building, every office, floor to ceiling gray. But every time, every single time, it\u2019s always just the slightest shade different. It keeps things interesting.\u201d\n\u201cIf that\u2019s your definition of interesting, I have some news for you about the things you are potentially going to witness in the next few months.\u201d\nJin laughs amiably at that, and it\u2019s a goofy, unguarded sort of laugh that Yoongi hasn\u2019t heard before. He doesn\u2019t realize he\u2019s staring at Jin until their eyes meet and he whips his head away nervously. Then Jin\u2019s gentle gales of laughter fade into soft chuckles, and Yoongi swears that he feels eyes on his face, even after the laughter has subsided completely.\n\u201cYou could always\u2026 I dunno. Get some plants, or something. You know, for your cube,\u201d Jin suggests after a moment.\n\u201cThe only plant that\u2019s ever had the misfortune of being mine died long before it ever had a chance to tell its tale of woe. I\u2019m lucky if I remember to feed\u00a0myself.\u201d\n\u201cGod, you know, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever actually seen you eat,\u201d Jin marvels quietly, pulling his coat tight around him.\nYoongi shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t need much. I strategically conserve energy.\u201d\n\u201cOh is that what you call it?\u201d Jin elbows him teasingly, and Yoongi tries very hard to scowl. \u201cWhat are you doing for lunch?\u201d\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a cup of expired yogurt in the breakroom fridge that\u2019s fair game now.\u201d\nYoongi has rarely seen anything but a sweet smile on Jin\u2019s exquisite face, so the ensuing look of disgust is unsettling. \u201cI am almost offended,\u201d Jin admits, lip curling in displeasure. But he seems to snap out of it, gently tugging on Yoongi\u2019s elbow. \u201cCome on. You can have my second lunch.\u201d\nYoongi reluctantly allows himself to be led, with only the mildest of protestations.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s true, Yoongi admits grudgingly to himself, that he has noticed a very slight decline in his productivity in the last few weeks, but it has absolutely nothing to do with the presence of his new neighbor. Working across from Jin isn\u2019t distracting at all.\nExcept for when Jin gets a bit restless and stiff after sitting still for too long, stretches in his chair, making the most delicious little groaning sound while extending his hands up over his head, hitching up his shirt and exposing a few inches of pretty golden skin.\nExcept for when he takes his second breakfast of the day at his desk, stuffing full his face of churros or doughnuts or pancakes or whatever tasty treat he has packed away for himself that day. The way that Jin enjoys food, Yoongi thinks, is similar to the way that most people enjoy sex, if the noises that he makes are any indication. One day, the day that Jin brings cinnamon buns, Yoongi mortifyingly gets half-hard at his desk just listening to him.\nAnd then there are the times when Jin puts in his headphones and starts singing quietly and badly and mindlessly under his breath, and that\u2019s actually not hot at all, which is what Yoongi finds most disturbing, because he can\u2019t stop smiling whenever he hears it.\n\u201cWhat the hell are you smiling about?\u201d Hoseok\u2019s voice jars him from his pleasant little lull.\n\u201cI fucked your mom last night,\u201d Yoongi replies easily, any remnant of a smile sliding from his face in an instant.\u00a0\n\u201cBuddy, we both know you\u2019d prefer dad,\u201d Hoseok says a little bit too loudly, and Yoongi hurriedly hushes him, pivoting his body subtly to make sure that Jin still has his headphones in. He\u2019s relieved to see that he does, though he\u2019s stopped singing.\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Yoongi glares at him.\n\u201cJust wanted to come say hello to my good friend,\u201d Hoseok replies vaguely, peeking surreptitiously around Yoongi to catch a glimpse of Jin\u2019s broad back. Yoongi glares. \u201cOh, damn he\u2019s not even-\u201d he clears his throat, and when he speaks again, his voice is twice as loud, and rather stilted. \u201cI just wanted to bring you some coffee.\u201d He reaches over the low cubicle wall as if to pass Yoongi a cup of name-brand coffee, but as soon as Yoongi reaches his hand forward to take it, Hoseok yanks it away.\n\u201cWhat the hell, dude?\u201d Yoongi demands, reaching again for the coffee, but Hoseok just holds it further out of his reach, still looking past him, at Jin\u2019s hunched back.\u00a0\"Give me the damn coffee.\"\n\u201cShh, just wait a second. God he\u2019s oblivious,\u201d Hoseok insists in a hushed tone, reaching over the wall and onto Yoongi\u2019s desk to grab a piece of paper. He crumbles it up into a tiny ball, and Yoongi lunges at him.\n\u201cThat\u2019s an expense report, asshole!\u201d\nHoseok shrugs him off and winds his arm back, lobbing the paper ball forward with maximum force. It whizzes past Yoongi\u2019s face and smacks Jin directly in the back of his head.\n\u201cI JUST WANTED TO BRING YOU SOME COFFEE,\u201d Hoseok repeats louder yet, and so stilted that Yoongi almost actually laughs. Jin has turned around now, rubbing the back of his head tenderly. \u201cOh, hey Jin. I didn\u2019t see you there.\u201d\n\u201cHi, Hoseok,\u201d Jin kindly returns his greeting, eyes slightly confused.\n\u201cI was just bringing my best friend Yoongi some coffee,\u201d he says with a stiff smile. \u201cActually, this is so weird, but I totally have an extra one. So crazy. Do you, uh, want it?\u201d\nJin\u2019s smile is sweet, and Yoongi fights down a surge of irritation. \u201cThat\u2019s so nice, Hoseok. Thanks!\u201d\nYoongi purses his lips sourly as Hoseok shuffles over to the aisle between their cubes and politely hands Jin the second cup of coffee.\nJin takes a small sip and makes one of his sinful noises of appreciation, his cup lingering by his mouth.\u00a0 \u201cIs this Hazelnut? Mmmm, my favorite.\u201d\n\u201cOh, is it?\u201d Hoseok asks in mock surprise. \u201cI had no idea.\u201d\nYoongi reaches out his hand to accept the other cup, but not before Hoseok brings the cup to his own mouth, instead.\n\u201cHey, what about me?\u201d Yoongi demands as Hoseok and Jin sip away contentedly.\n\u201cAh, sorry Yoongi,\u201d Hoseok apologizes unconvincingly, leaning against the entrance to Jin\u2019s cubicle. \u201cI totally spaced. I\u2019ll get you tomorrow.\u201d\nYoongi knows better, though, so he makes sure to buy himself a coffee on the way to work the next day.\nWell, he actually buys himself\u00a0two\u00a0coffees. For no particular reason. The order just kind of just comes spilliing\u00a0out of his mouth when he reaches the front of the line at the coffee shop.\u00a0Two coffees, room for cream, one pump of Hazelnut syrup.\nHe keeps his head tucked self-consciously as he walks into the office, because he knows that if even one thing is the slightest bit different, two coffees instead of one, someone is going to notice. But he\u2019s lucky today. The office is completely silent, and he seems to be the first one in.\nHe makes his way over to their\u00a0corner but hesitates in the aisle between the entrances to the two cubicles. He twitches towards Jin\u2019s cube, then thinks better of it, then takes a tentative step, then thinks better of it again. He\u2019s about to try once more when he hears a voice behind him.\n\u201cIs that for your boyfriend?\u201d\nYoongi startles so violently that hot coffee sloshes out of the opening in the lids of the coffees in his hands, and he very nearly loses his tentative grip on them.\n\u201cFuck!\u201d he swears as the scalding liquid burns his skin.\n\u201cOh. Sorry,\u201d Hoseok apologizes half-heartedly, starting forward slightly as if to help. He doesn\u2019t.\n\u201cWhy did you sneak up on me, asshole?\u201d Yoongi mutters as he appraises the damage. His hands are a tinged pink from the hot coffee, and it looks like he\u2019s pissed himself.\n\u201cWhy are you so jumpy?\u201d Hoseok shoots back, looking slightly shocked himself, but mostly triumphant. Yoongi flushes deeply, tenderly holding the cups of coffee so as to make as little contact with his skin as possible. \u201cWait,\u201d Hoseok realizes with a cruel smirk, \u201cIs that seriously for Jin?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Yoongi denies on reflex. \u201cThey\u2019re both for me.\u201d\nHoseok takes a few steps closer, sniffing the air around Yoongi. His mouth drops open in amused shock. \u201cIs that Hazelnut?\u201d\n\u201cFrench Vanilla,\u201d Yoongi lies instantly and without pause.\n\u201cYou-\u201d Hoseok starts with a look of ecstatic wonder, but he is cut off by the sound of another voice behind him.\n\u201c\u2019Morning!\u201d Jin greets them brightly, striding past Hoseok to where Yoongi is standing, frozen, looking like he\u2019s just been caught with his hand in the cookie jar. He takes one look at Yoongi\u2019s soaked pants and raises an eyebrow. \u201cLittle accident?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, he pissed himself when I caught him trying to leave that coffee on your desk,\u201d Hoseok answers helpfully with badly disguised glee.\nJin, however, gently takes one of the cups of coffee from his hands with a kind smile. \u201cFor me? Thanks, Yoongi.\u201d\nHoseok stifles a laugh, while Yoongi stares at Jin, mouth slightly agape.\nJin takes a small sip, and there\u2019s that noise again. Yoongi anxiously licks his lips. \u201cMmm, Hazelnut. This is amazing.\u201d\nYoongi can\u2019t think of a single real word in response, so he just gapes dumbly to Jin\u2019s turned back. He averts his gaze when he sees Hoseok dramatically mouth the word \u2018hazelnut\u2019 at him and just shuffles over to his desk chair, flipping Hoseok a casual bird as he sets down his cup of coffee and opens up his email.\nHe doesn\u2019t realize he\u2019s been staring at the same sentence for some time until Jin\u2019s voice snaps him out of his trance. \u201cHey, do you have that expense report from yesterday? The one for the hover boards?\u201d Jin asks from across the aisle.\nYoongi glances at the balled-up wad of paper underneath Jin\u2019s desk, imagining himself stuffing it down Hoseok\u2019s throat.\n\u201cUh, yeah. I just need to\u2026 print it out again,\u201d Yoongi mutters quietly, turning back to his computer and clicking into Excel to open the spreadsheet.\nExcept it\u2019s not there. Yoongi searches every folder on his desktop, every folder within a folder, but it\u2019s just gone.\nThen someone across the room clears his throat meaningfully, and Yoongi pops his head up over the half-wall of his cube, scanning the room. Kim Taehyung stands facing him, spinning a small keychain with a USB attached on his index finger and looking despicably smug.\nYoongi swells with rage, trying to be as silent as he can as he mouths the words\u00a0\u2018Do you want to die you fucker?\u2019\u00a0across the room. Taehyung\u2019s smirk just deepens, and he gestures to Yoongi with his keychain-bearing finger to follow him.\nYoongi hesitates for a moment, chancing a glance at Jin, who is obliviously working away, then locks his computer screen and walks purposefully out of his cube, down the aisle, and into the supply closet, where Taehyung had been headed.\nIt\u2019s almost pitch black when the door swings shut behind Yoongi. He hears a sharp\u00a0clap clap\u00a0and a soft, pink light illuminates the small room. Taehyung sits on a chair in the middle, his hands clasped in front of him.\n\u201cIs this clap-activated mood lighting?\u201d Yoongi asks, squinting at the dull pink glowing bulbs, momentarily forgetting his rage. \u201cWhat do you do in here?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t change the subject,\u201d Taehyung instructs him lazily, twirling that USB on his finger again. Yoongi twitches towards him as if to launch it across the room. \u201cWe both know you already know what\u2019s on this USB, Yoongi. And if you want it back, there\u2019s a price to pay.\u201d\n\u201cTae, that is an expense report. This is not a hostage exchange. Can we dispense with the dramatics?\u201d\n\u201cWe cannot.\u201d\n\u201cFine, what do you want?\u201d\n\u201cI want you\u2026\u201d Taehyung starts, pushing himself to his feet before starting his slow advance on Yoongi. Yoongi swallows his spit on reflex and takes half a step back, \u201c\u2026to come to Karaoke and drinks. Tonight.\u201d\n\u201cNope,\u201d Yoongi responds flatly, the tension seeping from the air almost instantaneously. \u201cKeep your goddamn USB. Bye.\u201d\n\u201cThink about it, Yoongi,\u201d Taehyung tells him, grabbing his arm gently. \u201cOne hour all alone, recreating a spreadsheet you\u2019ve already made, or a night of fun out with your closest, oldest friends?\u201d\n\u201cThe spreadsheet one,\u201d Yoongi confirms easily.\nTaehyung stamps his food moodily. \u201cThat is not what you were supposed to say. Fine. I\u2019m calling it in. I\u2019m calling in my big favor.\u201d\nThat actually does stagger Yoongi a little. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cLet me take you back\u2026..\u201d\n\u201cTae\u2026\u201d Yoogi warns him.\n\u201c\u2026to the spring of 2012\u2026when a poor, handsome young boy named Kim Taehyung-\u201d\n\u201cI was there, Tae. I remember. Get to the point.\u201d\n\u201cYou stole my phone and sent my tasteful nudes to my beloved grandmother, you ass. Do you know how distraught she was? I had to tell her I was sending those pictures to my doctor to get a mole checked out, Yoongi.\u201d\n\u201cI was very drunk, the photos were on Jimin\u2019s phone, and actually you really do need to get that mole checked out.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re coming to karaoke whether you like it or not.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been holding onto this favor for four years and you\u2019re using it for\u00a0this?\u201d Yoongi demands. \u201cTo make me come out for drinks with the same five assholes I\u2019ve been drinking with for years?\u201d\n\u201cYep.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026why?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0It\u2019s drinks with\u00a0six\u00a0assholes. And it goes about how Yoongi expects it to go.\nTaehyung has never been subtle about- well anything, really. So as he sits between Yoongi and Jin in the cab on the way to the Karaoke bar with a disturbing, conspiratorial grin, glancing as if on loop from left to right to left back to his right, Yoongi wants nothing more than to melt into the disgusting fabric of the back seat.\nThe whole thing starts out harmless enough, as their gatherings often do. Deceptively harmless.\nFirst up, Taehyung and Jimin sing a suspiciously well-harmonized rendition of Bryan Adams\u2019 Heaven, and Yoongi tries like hell to ignore Jin\u2019s pointed, unmissable look that seems to say \u2018are you seeing what I\u2019m seeing\u2019?\nBut then it\u2019s a matter of minutes, and Namjoon\u2019s spiraling fast, even for him. Jimin and Taehyung keep just keep funneling him drinks, pressing shots into his hand with devilish smiles. Then Jungkook orders a round of Jager Bombs and spikes his glass on the floor. Luckily, Yoongi notes with pleasure, the cup is actually plastic, so it bounces back off of the floor and hits him in the dick.\n\u201cHow have you guys not been kicked out of here?\u201d Jin shouts over the persistent roar of Jungkook\u2019s screamo ballad.\n\u201cOh, we have,\u201d Jimin shouts over Taehyung\u2019s twerking form. \u201cThe trick is to never let them see your face. The only pics the employees have been able to get for the Wall of Shame are blurry shots of Tae\u2019s bare ass. They never have any clue that it\u2019s us until Yoongi busts out the Celine Dion. Dead giveaway.\u201d\n\u201cShut the hell your mouth,\u201d Yoongi slurs in warning, but Jimin just giggles impishly and starts smacking Taehyung\u2019s ass.\n\u201cCeline?\u201d Jin demands, looking obnoxiously pleased.\n\u201cIt\u2019s always the highlight of the night. I am a fucking delight,\u201d Yoongi growls moodily. \u201cHey, Tae. How much longer to I have to stay?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Yoongi, how long did it take for my grandmother to forget the sight of my erect penis?\u201d Taehyung yells, still twerking, sweat rolling in delicate beads down his face.\n\u201cWith comments like that, who needs context?\u201d Jin adds casually, taking a dainty sip of beer, and he fits in really well, Yoongi thinks, eyes drifting down to watch Jin\u2019s neck when he swallows.\u00a0Corporate bastard. \u201cHey, is Namjoon okay?\u201d\nYoongi doesn\u2019t see Namjoon immediately, but then there he is, staring intently at the fake potted plant in the corner of the room.\n\u201cHe\u2019s probably just having his bi-weekly existential crisis. It\u2019ll pass,\u201d Yoongi assures him, blindly throwing back whatever shot Hoseok has just thrust into his hand.\nGradually, Yoongi realizes that the room\u2019s a little blurrier than he would like it to be, and everything is happening really fast. He didn\u2019t even feel it sneaking up on him, the slow delicious burn enveloping his limbs, then his head, then his tongue, making it heavy and loose and tingly. One minute, Jin\u2019s sitting right beside him and the next, he\u2019s at the front of the room nervously clutching the mic as Jungkook hangs fondly off of his neck.\nHe\u2019d fully expected Jin to a terrible singer, judging from his cute, awful cubicle mini-concerts, but, okay, he\u2019s actually kind of good, and Yoongi has no clue what song this is, but it\u2019s his new favorite.\n\u201cEw,\u201d Hoseok says as he plops down beside Yoongi, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen that look on your face before.\u201d\n\u201cWhat look?\u201d\n\u201cSmitten. Like Taehyung when Jimin wears jeggings.\u201d\n\u201cI hate you,\u201d Yoongi mutters, sinking down in his seat and crossing his arms over his chest. \u201cAll of you. Why are you guys doing this to me?\u201d\n\u201cToday in particular? Because we got bored of flicking quarters off of Jimin\u2019s butt earlier. But in the long term? Because we love you and want you to be happy.\u201d Hoseok\u2019s arms snake around him, clinging to Yoongi like a giant, hairless koala.\n\u201cFuck off,\u201d Yoongi mutters affectionately, the tips of his ears flaming red as he shoves Hoseok off of him and slides even deeper into his seat.\n\u201cFine, I have to pee anyway. Hey, Tae. Jimin. Kook. Accompany me to the pissroom.\u201d Yoongi eyes him strangely, watching as the three youngest seemingly materialize by his side. \u201cWe\u2019ll be right back,\u201d Hoseok assures Yoongi, patting his shoulder fondly. Then they\u2019re gone.\nJin steps gingerly over Namjoon, who is face-down on the floor, moaning miserably into an abandoned microphone.\n\u201cDo they always go to the bathroom together?\u201d Jin questions, ignoring Namjoon, who wraps his arms weakly around Jin\u2019s leg as he tries to step over him.\nYoongi\u2019s phone lights up with a message from Hoseok:\n\u00a0\nAsshole #1: Be safe ;)\n\u00a0\n\u201cOnly when they\u2019re ditching us,\u201d Yoongi sighs morosely.\n\u201cThey probably just didn\u2019t want to have to deal with this human mess,\u201d Jin ventures, gently nudging Namjoon\u2019s butt with the toe of his shoe. Namjoon\u2019s artificially amplified groans echo off of the empty, white walls where lurid lights still flash.\n\u201cYep. Probably,\u201d Yoongi mutters unconvincingly through tight lips, letting his head fall hopelessly forward onto the table with a dull thunk. \u201cOw.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m dyiiing,\u201d Namjoon whines into the crisp night air, leaning heavily on Jin and pulling him close. \u201cWow you smell so good. You smell like a rich person\u2019s bathroom,\u201d he mumbles into Jin\u2019s neck, his face sobering for a moment before it crumples again and he rapidly devolves into a sniffling, leaking mess. \u201cDo you guys\u2026 know how much I fucking love you?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s very sweet, Namjoon,\u201d Jin assures him, \u201cbut let\u2019s just focus on walking for now.\u201d\n\u201cOh, here he goes,\u201d Yoongi notes almost passively as Namjoon\u2019s already dragging feet come to a halt.\n\u201cNo no NO,\u201d Namjoon slurs, eyelids half-closed, \u201cYou don\u2019t get it. You don\u2019t understand. You don\u2019t get it. I know I\u2019m like Bleh Mr. Boss-Face all the time but I literally just like\u2026 literally love you guys so much.\u201d\n\"I mean, I assumed he would be a mess, but this is wow,\" Jin notes, nose crinkled in mild disgust.\nNamjoon stops swaying then, spine going rigid, and Yoongi knows what that means. \u201cOh god. Oh fuck. Somebody hold my hair.\u201d\n\u201cHe turns into a drunk white girl from a teen movie when he drinks,\u201d Yoongi informs Jin, patting Namjoon\u2019s short, trim hair tenderly the tall blond man abruptly bends double and starts hurling on the sidewalk.\n\u201cWhen did I eat Spaghetti Os?\u201d Namjoon wonders distractedly when his heaving has subsided, and he sounds a little panicked when he continues. \u201cGuys seriously when did I eat fucking Spaghetti Os?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat do you do after you\u2019ve seen your boss\u2019 naked ass as he sobs into a can of Spaghetti Os on his kitchen floor?\u201d Jin wonders aloud as he and Yoongi meander down the dark, empty street towards the bus stop.\n\u201cYou set the photo you took as his computer background on Monday and ask for a raise,\u201d Yoongi instructs him, scrolling through the pictures on his phone. \u201cThis actually looks like some weird, artistic porn or something. I should upload this. Somebody would be into this.\u201d\nJin leans closer to get a better look, reaching over to scroll through the photos himself, and Yoongi conspicuously stiffens. \u201cWow, you\u2019re right. It\u2019s like\u2026 both disgusting and weirdly sensual. You\u2019ve got a good eye for setting up shots.\u201d\n\u201cI knew I should have gone into porn production,\u201d Yoongi laments, deadpan, satisfied when Jin gives a short, high chuckle.\n\u201cWell, the company is very lucky that you decided on a different career path,\u201d Jin says kindly.\nYoongi rolls his eyes. \u201cYeah I\u2019ve clearly been doing a real bang-up job,\u201d he replies dryly. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re here, right? Because it\u2019s been going so well?\u201d\n\u201cHey, look. From what I can see, there is a lot of shit wrong with the branch,\u201d Jin starts, eyes widening almost unbelievingly, \u201cLike\u00a0a lot\u00a0of shit. I am, honestly, stunned that a place like this even exists, much less functions somehow.\u201d Yoongi thinks he\u2019s done, but Jin\u2019s on a roll. \u201cLike, you guys are the biggest fucking mess I have ever personally seen.\u201d\n\u201cUh, thanks?\u201d Yoongi says uncertainly, feeling a bit like he\u2019s just been insulted.\n\u201cNo, I mean- What I mean is, there are a lot of things wrong with that place. But you\u2019re definitely not one of them.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Yoongi mumbles, looking at his feet. They\u2019ve stopped now, having reached the deserted bus stop. \u201cThanks.\u201d\nJin smiles sweetly at him, rocking back and forth on his heels. \u201cAny time.\u201d\n\u201cUh, are you taking this bus, too?\u201d Yoongi questions him as Jin leans against the covered bench.\n\u201cMe? No, I\u2019m the other way,\u201d Jin explains, pointing over his shoulder.\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll see you Monday?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll wait with you until the bus gets here.\u201d\n\u201cOh, no, that\u2019s okay, reall-\u201d Yoongi protests, waving his hands in front of him.\n\u201cYou\u2019re tiny, drunk, and pretty,\u201d Jin interrupts him, settling in against the covered bench. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving you alone out here.\u201d\nYoongi swells with indignity and embarrassment. \u201cExcuse me? Tiny? Drunk?\u201d He hesitates, his face aflame as he struggles with the last adjective. \u201c\u2026 Tiny?\u201d he repeats, and Jin chuckles pleasantly. \u201cI would kick your ass if it wasn\u2019t an HR violation.\u201d\n\u201cAnd here I was thinking that you were the type to be down for some major policy violation.\u201d Jin\u2019s smirk is infuriatingly hot. Yoongi just exhales heavily, wondering if he was interpreting that statement incorrectly. \u201cAh, look,\u201d Jin points triumphantly over Yoongi\u2019s shoulder as the bus roars near. \u201cI guess I win. See you Monday.\u201d\nYoongi stares after his broad, retreating figure so intently that he almost misses the bus.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYoongi slams his hands against the desk on either side of Hoseok, leaning intimidatingly close. \u201cWhatever ridiculous Parent Trap bullshit you guys are trying to pull, fucking don\u2019t.\u201d\nFar from looking intimidated, Hoseok looks extremely pleased. \u201cSo how did it go? Did you guys fuck in a semi-public place? OH- wait, on Namjoon's bed?\u201d\nYoongi snarls in disgust. \u201cYou are so gross. And no. Nothing happened. Nothing is\u00a0going\u00a0to happen. He is still my nemesis.\u201d\n\u201cYoongi, I love and admire you, but you fall in love like a second grade boy.\u201d\nYoongi reels back with the force of his protest. \u201cYou- I.. HE.. Oh you just don\u2019t- Look\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d Hoseok prompts him to continue, wearing a sickeningly satisfied smile.\nYoongi chews his lip in frustration, trying for a few moments to formulate a counter-argument before he abruptly gives up and turns indignantly on heel, retreating rapidly as he stalks back to his corner of the office.\n\u201cHey guys,\u201d Jin calls gently from near Jimin and Taehyung\u2019s desks, but it still scares the hell out of Yoongi, who hadn\u2019t noticed him standing just 20 feet away. \u201cQuick casual meeting?\u201d\nThe rest of the guys come shuffling out of the woodwork to congregate in the center of the room.\n\u201cOkay, I know I am here to advise in a mainly financial role, but there are some other potentially concerning items that Corporate would like me to address while I\u2019m here,\u201d Jin starts, looking very much in his element.\n\u201cSometimes I forget he\u2019s a capitalist lapdog,\u201d Namjoon whispers to Yoongi with a pleased smile, who shoots him a skeptical look. \u201cHe\u2019s just so damn pleasant.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not that damn pleasant,\u201d Yoongi mumbles under his breath.\n\u201cFirst of all, I have some bad news that some of you may have already heard,\u201d Jin continues, unaware of the exchange. \u201cThis year will be the last Jammies.\u201d\nA collective groan goes up, and Jin tries to hush them with his hands. \u201cWhat about office morale? What about team building?\u201d Hoseok demands.\n\u201cTeamwork makes the dream work!\u201d Jungkook insists, spine going rigid in outrage.\n\u201cI know, I know,\u201d Jin tries to calm them with a sympathetic tone. \u201cI know how important \u2018team building\u2019 is to this particular office. That\u2019s why we\u2019re going to start implementing more low-cost teambuilding seminars, rather than all of these extravagant events. Hoseok, you're Human Resources. Do you have any ideas about who you might want to put in charge of those events?\u201d\n\u201cNo brainer,\u201d Hoseok answers instantly. \u201cSales Team.\u201d\nJimin and Taehyung high-five enthusiastically across their desks. Jin runs his hands through his hair in irritation. \u201cGreat. Perfect. Walked right into that one,\u201d he mutters resignedly, \u201cAnyway, issue number two. Casual Friday.\u201d\n\u201cI fucking told you guys he was coming for Casual Friday,\u201d Taehyung gloats.\n\u201cNo, no, don\u2019t worry. Casual Friday will still be a thing,\u201d Jin assures them. \u201cWe just need to set a couple of limitations. For instance, no jeggings.\u201d\nJimin scoffs indignantly. \u201cI feel like that is an extremely targeted attack.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 in an office environment, it\u2019s a little distracting,\u201d Jin tells him carefully.\n\u201cYeah it is,\u201d Taehyung growls with a satisfied smirk, reaching across his desk to give Jimin another high-five, and Jimin looks mildly assuaged.\n\u201cThe last item is just more of a general inquiry, but extremely concerning nonetheless,\u201d Jin continues after allowing himself a brief roll of his eyes. \u201cDoes anyone have an explanation as to why there is not a single woman who works in this office?\u201d\n\u201cThe Patriarchy?\u201d Namjoon offers casually.\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t that make you The Patriarchy?\u201d Hoseok asks him, mindlessly shredding a post-it note. \u201cYou\u00a0are\u00a0the boss.\u201d\nNamjoon cocks his head to the side, squinting his eyes in thought. \u201cOh my God. I\u2019m the problem. I\u2019m The Patriarchy.\u201d\n\u201cNo, wait a second guys,\u201d Taehyung cuts in, looking confused. \u201cWhat about Pearls? Pearls is a woman. And she\u2019s worked here forever.\u201d\nYoongi thinks he\u2019s kidding for a moment, some sick joke, but the genuine befuddlement that graces his features tells him otherwise. \u201cTae, Pearls is dead.\u201d\nTaehyung waves him off with an indulgent chuckle. \u201cYour black humor is charming as always, Yoongi.\u201d\n\u201cTae, I\u2019m not kidding. Pearls died like three years ago.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Taehyung demands, face falling in utter devastation. \u201cWhy did nobody tell me Pearls was fucking dead? I loved Pearls.\u201d\n\u201cObviously,\u201d Hoseok scoffs bitterly. \u201cYou never even noticed she was gone.\u201d\n\u201cShe was always quiet!\u201d Taehyung insists, looking distraught.\n\u201cWait,\u201d Jimin says suddenly, looking confused. \u201cIf Pearls is dead, who the hell have I been sending our customer complaints to for the last three years?\u201d\n\u201cJesus H. Christ,\u201d Namjoon despairs, burying his head in his hands.\n\u00a0\nYoongi arrives a few hours late on Friday, courtesy of a dentist appointment.\nAnd he\u2019s definitely still loopy from the veritable cornucopia of drugs that it had taken for him to let a dentist anywhere near his mouth, but the moment he crosses the threshold into the unnaturally still office, he knows something is up. He can sense it even through his haze. He\u2019s gotten good at picking up on these little atmospheric shifts. He\u2019s had to.\nIt\u2019s the kind of scary stillness that hangs about the air when someone is hiding. The main room is a battlefield, littered with confetti and silly string, with one small clean area on the floor in the vague shape of a human body. Someone\u2019s abandoned coffee lies splattered across the floor, utterly forgotten in the madness. Yoongi stoops down and sniffs the air gingerly. Hazelnut.\nHe proceeds to his desk with caution, shaking off a stray strand of silly string that has adhered to the bottom of his shoe, immensely unsettled that he doesn\u2019t know where anyone is or what they might be doing. Usually, he tries to keep tabs on them all, when he can. It\u2019s a survival instinct. Never turn your back on danger.\nHe scans the area over the top of the half-walls before lowering himself down into his seat. A haunting giggle echoes in the distance, and it sounds like Jimin.\nJust as he is trying to get comfortable, wriggling around in his immensely uncomfortable chair, his foot comes into contact with something soft. Something soft that moves and gently grabs his ankle.\nBefore he can scream, a large hand emerges from underneath his desk and clamps down on his mouth. He panics, kicking out blindly. He hears a soft \u2018ouch!\u2019 and then Jin\u2019s face is peeking up at him from the darkness under his desk.\n\u201cShhhhh!\u201d Jin urges in a desperate, hushed whisper. He looks awful. His hair is a mess, sticking up in all directions, bolstered by the silly string that looks to be matted into it. His eyes are wild and terrified, and his shirt has been ripped so violently that all that remains of the left side is one limply hanging flap that exposes his entire shoulder and a good portion of his chest. Yoongi is at once shocked, concerned, and aroused.\n\u201cWhat the fuck, dude?\u201d Yoongi hisses right back, confused and disoriented, willing his heart to slow as he recovers from his shock. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\u201cThey fucking swarmed. It was legitimately terrifying,\u201d Jin recounts, eyes darting nervously about. \u201cThe second I walked through the door, they were on me. They were everywhere. I\u2026 I got away, but I don\u2019t know where they went.\u201d\n\u201cWhy? What\u2019s happening?\u201d Yoongi demands, trying to ignore the fact that an utterly debauched looking Jin is kneeling on the floor in front of him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s my birthday,\u201d he says with an almost comical soberness, bracing his hands on Yoongi\u2019s knees (fuck) and craning his head to try and peek around the corner of the cubicle wall. Yoongi swallows hard, unable to tear his eyes away from Jin\u2019s slightly parted lips. Jin\u2019s hands slide further up as he positions himself for a better view, and his fingers unconsciously tighten around Yoongi\u2019s thighs.\n\u201cFeels like\u00a0my\u00a0birthday,\u201d Yoongi marvels blearily, and a second later, he feels the blood rapidly drain from his face. \u201cOhhhhh fuck, was that not just in my mind?\u201d he whispers, his panic only intensifying. He slaps himself hard in the face, relieved when the warmth of Jin\u2019s hands has suddenly disappeared from his knees. \u201cOh my god am I still talking out loud, why can\u2019t I stop-\u201d\nHe\u2019s on the verge of slapping himself again, but Jin\u2019s strong fingers stay his hand. \u201cYoongi. Calm down.\u201d\n\u201cSorry, I\u2019m high.\u201d Jin arches one thick, perfect eyebrow, and Yoongi backtracks instantly. \u201cUh, no, not on real drugs\u2026 On dentist drugs.\u201d He is absolutely certain there is such a thing as dentist drugs. \u201cI have... dental anxiety\u2026\u201d He clears his throat in embarrassment. \u201cUh, go on with your story about things.\u201d\n\u201cYoongi, they were out of control. I have silly string in places that no human should ever have silly string. And I only just managed to get away before the public birthday lashes. Not spankings.\u00a0Lashes.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised. They were getting restless. Nobody\u2019s come into work on their birthday in years. We all know better, but it looks like nobody warned you.\u201d\nJin settles back into his safe space beneath Yoongi\u2019s desk. \u201cNot even Namjoon. He just sat there, watching\u2026 Yoongi, his eyes were so cold.\u201d Jin shudders at the memory. \u201cAnd Jungkook! Quiet, sweet Jungkook\u2026\u201d\nYoongi snorts indelicately.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to help me,\u201d Jin continues desperately, grabbing onto the material of Yoongi\u2019s pants. \u201cHide me. Please? Let me stay here.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? All day?\u201d Yoongi demands, trying half-heartedly to pull his legs away from Jin\u2019s iron grip. \u201cYou\u2019re going to stay under there all fuckin-\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Taehyung says loudly, peeking over the wall, and Yoongi startles so hard that he\u2019s pretty sure he knees Jin in the face. Luckily, from where Taehyung is standing, Jin\u2019s crouched form is completely obscured.\n\u201cI\u2026 am\u2026 just\u2026 talking to my dick,\u201d Yoongi explains very seriously. He hears Jin heave a great frustrated sigh because, yeah, that\u2019s not great.\nTaehyung appraises him suspiciously for a moment before relaxing into a goofy smile \u201cAw, you're still dentist high, aren\u2019t you buddy?\u201d\nYoongi nods eagerly, amazed.\n\u201cWell hey, have you seen Jin? We have a birthday present for him, and he\u2019s disappeared,\u201d Taehyung continues, eyes darting around the small space.\n\u201cUh, no, I haven\u2019t. Maybe he left?\u201d\n\u201cNo he\u2019s still in the building. Jungkook says he\u2019s still using the wifi to do his work from his tablet,\u201d Taehyung informs him casually, craning his head to get a look inside Jin\u2019s cubicle. Jin curses quietly under his desk, tossing his now powered-down tablet to the floor beside him.\n\u201cOh. Haven\u2019t seen him. Sorry,\u201d Yoongi says casually, unlocking his computer and pulling up his email in the hopes that Taehyung will leave.\n\u201cWell if you do see him, just hold him down and shout, okay?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, sure. Whatever,\u201d Yoongi agrees passively.\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll let you get back to your conversation,\u201d Taehyung says, gesturing down to Yoongi\u2019s crotch. \u201cBut hey, you know whose dick you should be conversing with, right? While you're nice and doped up and forthcoming.\u201d\nYoongi goes rigid, eyes wide as Taehyung waggles his eyebrows suggestively. \u201cGo away!\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cJi-\u201d\nYoongi chucks a dense accounting book so hard in his direction that if Taehyung hadn\u2019t ducked, he might have broken his nose. As it is, the book slams into the near wall and clatters to the floor with a dense\u00a0bang.\n\u201cBye!\u201d Taehyung trills as he skips away, slamming the door to the breakroom, where the rest of them are presumably gathered.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Yoongi whispers harshly at Jin, heading off Taehyung\u2019s mortifying comments by pretending they never even happened. \u201cHaven\u2019t you seen movies? Technology is always how they find you, man. They always know. You\u2019ve gotta go off-grid.\u201d\n\u201cWell excuse me, for trying to work at work,\u201d Jin defends himself, nose in the air. \u201cNow go get me a pen and that folder on my desk. Looks like I\u2019m doing things the old fashioned way today.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re seriously going to stay beneath my desk all day? Why? Why my desk?\n\u201cBecause,\u201d Jin huffs, \u201cIt's the last place they would expect.\u201d\nYoongi crosses his arms and tries to shift his head so that Jin can\u2019t see his burning ears. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just make a break for it?\u201d\n\u201cI refuse to lose a whole day of work. Plus, it\u2019s kind of cozy down here,\u201d Jin explains, settling back on his elbows and cuddling up to one of Yoongi\u2019s squishiest napping pillows. \u201cI mean, you\u2019ve got a whole little nest.\u201d\nYoongi just grunts and pushes his chair back as far as physically possible.\n\u00a0\n11:35am\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy does your phone keep buzzing?\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cJimin is live-tweeting your man hunt,\u201d Yoongi mumbles under his breath, refusing to tear his eyes away from his computer screen in case someone is looking. \u201cThey\u2019re paying schoolchildren to check the ductwork since Jimin\u2019s ass couldn\u2019t fit.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Good. Great.\u201d\n\u00a0\n12:26pm\n\u00a0\n\u201cDoes this say \u2018projectile vomit\u2019?\u201d Jin asks, shoving a form into Yoongi\u2019s lap. Yoongi makes a weird strangled sound as Jin\u2019s fingers brush his thigh, but if Jin notices, he doesn\u2019t say anything.\n\u201cProjected profit.\u201d\n\u201cDo you just, like, scribble in the vague shape of words?\u201d Jin mumbles, slipping the paper from between Yoongi\u2019s fingers and taking a second look.\n\u201cDid you really think I made a graph about projectile vomit?\u201d\n\u201cIf somebody in this office has not made a graph about or\u00a0with\u00a0projectile vomit, I will eat my own foot.\u201d\n\u201cYou totally would,\u201d Yoongi scoffs.\n\u201cWould what?\u201d\n\u201cEat your own foot.\u201d\n\u00a0\n1:10pm\n\u00a0\n\u201cYoongi, I\u2019m hungry.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re always hungry,\u201d Yoongi says soullessly as he tries to focus in the spreadsheet in front of him.\n\"But now I'm\u00a0really\u00a0hungry. I think it was all that talk about eating.\"\n\"You mean about eating your foot?\" Yoongi asks with a disgusted grimace.\n\u201cI can\u2019t skip meals,\u201d Jin whines, tugging at his pants again, pouting up at Yoongi endearingly.\u00a0 \u201cMy body is like a delicate microchip. It will be ruined if I don\u2019t carefully maintain it.\u201d\n\u201cWell, your foot's right there. Go crazy.\u201d\n\u201cYoongiiiiiiiiii,\u201d Jin complains, tugging so hard at Yoongi\u2019s pants that they actually slip down a little. Yoongi banishes a dangerous visual.\nHe huffs hard through his nose, shoving his keyboard away. \u201cWell, what do you want me to do about it?\u201d\n\u201cMy lunch is in the break room fridge. Can you go get it for me?\u201d\n\u201cYour assailants are all huddled in the break room at this very moment, plotting your capture. In Jimin\u2019s last tweet, there was talk of a bear trap. You seriously think they won\u2019t get suspicious when I take your lunch?\u201d\nJin waves his hand flippantly. \u201cIf they ask, just tell them you\u2019re stealing it because I\u2019m your mortal enemy or whatever bullshit it is you usually go with.\u201d\nYoongi\u2019s cheeks are warm as he rolls back his chair in indignation. He thinks about protesting for a moment, but he deflates embarrassingly fast. \u201cF-fine.\u201d\nHe pushes himself abruptly to his feet, shuffling towards the break room and resting his hand cautiously on the doorknob and pressing his ear to the door. Nothing. Carefully, he fixes his face with an expression of great apathy and turns the knob.\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you, his device has been offline for like an hour now,\u201d Jungkook informs the others, who are huddled around his laptop. Nobody seems to notice Yoongi, who just walks quietly past them towards the fridge.\n\u201cMaybe he actually ditched,\u201d Jimin suggests as Yoongi pulls the fridge door open and rifles around inside for Jin\u2019s meticulously packed lunch tin. It\u2019s obscured behind a jar of salad dressing and an unexplained bottle of lube. He maneuvers the tin around a tray of colorfully-frosted cupcakes that were obviously meant for Jin\u2019s birthday.\n\u201cMaybe he\u2019s dead,\u201d Jungkook contributes helpfully.\n\u201cKnowing Jin, more likely dead than ditched,\u201d Namjoon considers, stroking his chin thoughtfully. Yoongi shuts the refrigerator door as quietly as he is able, backing slowly towards the exit.\n\u201cWowie, I cannot believe he just\u00a0poof\u00a0disappeared,\u201d Hoseok adds in ridiculous, mocking dramatics, turning to wink at Yoongi, who freezes dead in his tracks. He hopes nobody else notices that he is very obviously lying.\n\u201cYou sure you checked their isolation corner, Hoseok?\u201d Taehyung asks, eyes still trained on Jungkook\u2019s screen.\n\u201cOf course. It was the first place I looked,\u201d Hoseok bites back, but he looks immensely pleased, making a lewd gesture at Yoongi behind their backs when they look away. \u201cPlus who would actually be dumb enough to hide there, anyway?\u201d\nYoongi glowers silently as he quietly pushes open the door to the hallway, slips through, and shuts it gently behind him.\n\u201cWell? Did they suspect anything?\u201d Jin asks as he tears into his lunch two minutes later, stuffing his mouth with a ludicrously large sandwich and moaning like an amateur porn star. Yoongi crosses his legs nervously.\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t even notice me. Too distracted by the hunt. I\u2019m talking full\u00a0The Most Dangerous Game\u00a0mode,\u201d Yoongi tells him, watching as Jin\u2019s jaws freeze mid-bite. He omits Hoseok\u2019s weird cover-up. That one is too hard to explain.\n\u201cYoongi, I like your friends, but they terrify me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n3:44pm\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, uh... Yoongi?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI have to pee.\u201d\n\u201cI am very sorry to hear that, Jin, because no fucking way is that happening.\u201d\n\u00a0\n3:56pm\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy are you dumping that bottle of lemonade down the toilet?\u201d Namjoon asks suspiciously, eyes widening in panic at Yoongi's lack of response. \u201cYoongi that had better be fucking lemonade.\u201d Yoongi is silent as he slowly closes the stall, watching Namjoon\u2019s disgusted face become smaller and smaller in the diminishing crack of the door. \u201cFuck, Yoongi! You really can\u2019t even get up to piss?\u201d\n\u00a0\n5:00pm\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe he evaded us the whole day,\u201d Jimin marvels as he and Taehyung pack up to go home. \u201cNo one\u2019s ever evaded us the whole day. I know we should be disappointed, but it\u2019s kind of thrilling.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait until his next birthday,\u201d Taehyung agrees before pausing for a moment. \u201cI\u2019m thinking we can get one of those tracking devices they put on whales and expand our hunt to the entire city.\u201d\n\u201cTae, he won\u2019t be here next year,\u201d Jimin reminds him gently, throwing an arm around Taehyung.\n\u201cShit. I think I\u2019m actually gonna miss that bougie little sellout,\u201d Namjoon adds, bag slung over his shoulder as he joins Jimin and Taehyung in the main room.\nJin accidentally nudges Yoongi\u2019s shoe as he shifts guiltily beneath the desk.\n\u201cAlright, alright, enough of that. You guys go ahead. I\u2019ll be right out,\u201d Hoseok urges, corralling them towards the door. \u201cWorking late, Yoongi?\u201d he shouts in the general direction of Yoongi\u2019s cubicle, the smile evident in his voice.\nYoongi startles slightly as he hears Hoseok\u2019s footsteps approaching. \u201cUh, yeah. Just a bit,\u201d he shouts right back, but there\u2019s no need. Hoseok is already right behind him. Yoongi cranes his head to shoot Hoseok a warning look.\n\u201cWhat an excellent employee you are,\u201d Hoseok gushes, squeezing Yoongi\u2019s shoulders in a show of support. \u201cOh, hey, you\u2019re a little far away from your desk there, aren\u2019t you, buddy? You\u2019ll never get any work done like that. Here, allow me.\u201d His hands tighten on Yoongi\u2019s shoulders as he rolls him and the desk chair forward and forward until his knees are on either side of Jin\u2019s body. He tries not to think about how close Jin\u2019s face is to his dick, but his high has long worn off, and the situation is now very fucking real. \u201cThere, alllll better. See you tomorrow! Be safe!\u201d\nWhen the door clicks shut behind them, Yoongi launches his chair away from Jin so hard that he crashes into the opposite cubicle wall, but Jin just slumps into a pile of relief and exhaustion on the floor. \u201cWhat a fucking day.\u201d\n\u201cUh, happy birthday?\u201d Yoongi tries valiantly as he awkwardly rubs the back of the neck before starting to gather his own things.\n\u201cThanks. And thanks for sheltering me all day.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever, no big,\u201d Yoongi dismisses him, ducking his head to fasten the buckle on his bag. \u201cDo you, uh, have plans for tonight?\u201d\n\u201cJust my usual birthday routine. Drinking wine in complete solitude,\u201d Jin mutters, crawling out stiffly from beneath Yoongi\u2019s desk. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 not as sad as it sounds. I was thinking about making something nice for dinner, too. A peaceful end to a crazy day.\u201d\nYoongi nods stiffly. \u201cWell. I\u2019ll let you go then. See you tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cYoongi, wait,\u201d Jin says suddenly, and his hand is on Yoongi\u2019s sleeve. \u201cDo you\u2026 Can I make you dinner?\u201d\n\u201cMake me dinner? Why?\u201d\nJin shrugs shyly. \u201cI dunno. I guess it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve gotten to cook for someone. Plus, I was with you the entire day, and I didn\u2019t see you eat one thing the whole damn time.\u201d\n\u201cI licked the icing off of your birthday cupcakes in the breakroom when I went to get your lunch.\u201d\n\u201cYou are like literally terrible at taking care of yourself,\u201d Jin informs him distastefully. \u201cYou know that right?\u201d\nHe tells himself he\u2019s going for the food.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJin\u2019s place looks nothing like Jin\u2019s place should look. It\u2019s cold and industrial and kind of empty, but Yoongi supposes that makes sense, considering that Jin has to travel light, that he\u2019s always got to be ready for the next move. Regardless, it\u2019s a little disconcerting.\n\u201cWhat do you want to drink?\u201d Jin asks, setting down his keys and heading for the kitchen. \u201cBeer? Wine? Liquor?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Yoongi replies vaguely, plopping himself down on the couch. He\u2019s been unbelievably tense the entire day, a consequence of both the manhunt and Jin\u2019s consistent proximity to his dick, but now, he can now feel the muscles in his body relax one by one. Jin just chuckles, and Yoongi hears the telltale\u00a0glug glug\u00a0of wine hitting the inside of a glass. He glances around the room. A couple of unpacked boxes sit in an otherwise empty dining room, and a generic piece of wall art hangs above the fake fireplace.\n\u201cNice place,\u201d Yoongi comments politely, not expecting Jin\u2019s undignified snort to echo from the kitchen.\n\u201cYeah right. It\u2019s shitty. Corporate chose it,\u201d Jin tells Yoongi as he hands him a glass of wine, unbuttoning his ruined work shirt as he makes his way back to the kitchen, stripping down to his white undershirt and slinging a kitchen towel over his shoulder. \u201cSo. What do you feel like eating?\u201d\n\u201cFood?\u201d Yoongi offers unhelpfully.\n\u201cOh come on.\u00a0 Tell me something you want to eat. I may still be living out of boxes, but you\u2019d better believe I keep a fully stocked kitchen.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, uh. Maybe\u2026 Chicken? Fried chicken?\u201d\n\u201cDone,\u201d Jin says with an easy smile, disappearing behind the refrigerator door, a comforting clinking sound coming from the kitchen as he rummages around inside.\nThere is something deadly attractive about Jin cooking. He moves with assurance and grace. He even converses more easily, though Yoongi thinks that maybe he could also attribute that to the wine. Jin is pleasantly flushed as the room fills with the thick, intoxicating smell of frying chicken, and cooking onions, and garlic, and something more savory, and god knows what else.\n\u201cWhere did you learn to cook like that?\u201d Yoongi wonders, mouth watering at the smell alone. Well, the visual doesn\u2019t hurt, either.\n\u201cI like to eat,\u201d Jin replies simply. \u201cGotta cook to eat.\u201d\n\u201cYou would make an excellent trophy husband for some rich older woman.\u201d\nJin cringes lightly as he tends the frying chicken. \u201cEugh.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? You don\u2019t date older?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t date women,\u201d Jin replies casually, though his eyes dart nervously towards Yoongi before flickering back to the task at hand. Yoongi\u2019s mouth falls open with a small popping noise. Jin must hear it, because he glances back over and laughs delightedly. \u201cThough there was this one time in college.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d Yoongi breathes uncertainly, trying to mask his shock and glee.\nJin look very pleased with himself. \u201cYou know, for someone who\u2019s apparently got a thing for Hoseok\u2019s dad, you look pretty shocked.\u201d\n\u201cYou heard that?\u201d Yoongi demands, standing abruptly, and wow he didn\u2019t feel buzzed when he was sitting down, but now, wow.\n\u201cAmong other things. Your friends like to talk a lot.\u201d\n\u201cWhy. Why do I bother. What is the point of friends?\u201d Yoongi despairs, taking an extraordinarily large sip of wine.\n\u201cI think they\u2019re just trying to help\u2026 in their way. Is it bad that I\u2019m still really jealous of you guys?\u201d Jin asks as he plates up the chicken and moves to stir a delicious looking white sauce in its pan.\n\u201cHow could you possibly be jealous of the dysfunctional clusterfuck that is our friend group?\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cThey\u2019re kind of great, actually. Plus, it\u2019s just too hard for me to maintain a friend group at all, dysfunctional clusterfuck or otherwise. The company recruited me straight out of college, and I\u2019ve been on the move ever since. Hard to maintain much of anything.\u201d\nHe carefully spoons the sauce into little ramekins and begins plating up some delicious looking greens.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the longest you\u2019ve been in one place?\u201d\n\u201cUh. Here. Already,\u201d Jin confesses with an uncertain smile. \u201cIt\u2019s been almost two months now. I usually have the job done in one.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you still haven\u2019t unpacked your boxes.\u201d\n\u201cNot much point unpacking if you\u2019re just going to have to pack again,\u201d Jin shrugs, grabbing the golden brown biscuits from the oven and sliding them onto the plates.\n\u201cNot much point living if you\u2019re just going to die,\u201d Yoongi prods teasingly, taking a big gulp of wine. Jin looks at him strangely then, the hot metal cookie sheet still clasped in his pink oven mitt. But the heat must seep through after a second, because he curses and hastily sets down the hot metal sheet on the stovetop.\n\u201cOuch. Uh, you ready to eat?\u201d Jin asks, and Yoongi nods eagerly. \u201cI don\u2019t have a dining room table, so I hope the couch is okay.\u201d\n\u201cMy dinner is usually ramen in bed, so a couch is actually a big step up for me.\u201d\nThe only problem with the couch is that it is a very squishy couch, so squishy that they both kind of sink into it when Jin sits down beside him. They both end up with their thighs touching in the middle, a problem that is only exacerbated by the fact that neither of them seem to fucking care. Yoongi blames the wine.\n\u201cJesus. This is the best thing I have put in my mouth since 2012,\u201d Yoongi informs him very seriously, slowly and peacefully chewing a bit of the fried green tomato.\n\u201cWhat did you eat in 2012?\u201d Jin asks, curious as he stuffs an entire biscuit in his mouth.\nYoongi chokes on his food, coughing on reflex. \u201cOh, right. Food. It was definitely food.\u201d\n\u201cOh, God,\u201d Jin moans with realization, face scrunching up like he\u2019s trying to erase a metal image. \u201cGross, Yoongi.\u201d\nYoongi can\u2019t help but chuckle at the look on Jin\u2019s face, and pretty soon Jin\u2019s laughing, too. It\u2019s a wonderful laugh. They\u2019re both probably laughing a little too hard, but they\u2019re tipsy and tired and Yoongi doesn\u2019t care. He wouldn\u2019t mind if the Earth stopped spinning, as long as Jin\u2019s warm, soft thigh was still pressed against his.\n\u201cHey, can I ask you a question?\u201d Jin says, wiping the tears from his eyes as their laughs subside. Yoongi\u2019s stomach clenches anxiously as he shrugs in passive agreement and buries his gaze in his plate. \u201cWhy are you an accountant?\u201d\nHe bristles at that, for some reason. \u201cWhat do you mean \u2018why am I an accountant?\u2019 I am kick-ass accountant.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I know you are,\u201d Jin assures him quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 I\u2019m sure you\u2019re kick-ass at other things, too.\u201d\n\u201cOf course I am. I\u2019m a genius.\u201d Yoongi is far too tired for modesty.\n\u201cSo\u2026 Why are you an accountant?\u201d Jin repeats.\nYoongi shrugs again, setting his clean plate down on the coffee table. \u201cIt\u2019s not like, some story of crushed dreams or anything like that. It was just a matter of compromise.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cI mean\u2026 There are things I always loved to do. And I still love to do them. I just decided not to dedicate my life to doing them. I decided it wasn\u2019t worth it.\u201d\n\u201cWorth what?\u201d\n\u201cHealth. Happiness. I dunno. Whatever the hell else I\u2019d have to give up. Back in my first year of college, I really fucked off, barely went to class. I didn\u2019t care about school, because I was giving the whole \u2018dream\u2019 thing an honest go. But\u2026 it wasn\u2019t good for me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat was the dream?\u201d Jin asks, straightening up.\n\u201cI am not telling you that,\u201d Yoongi says without hesitation.\n\u201cOh come on.\u201d\n\u201cNo fucking way.\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d Jin pouts, \u201cI\u2019ll just ask Tae.\u201d\n\u201cGo ahead. He would never betray me like that, and even as I say those words I realize how untrue they are,\u201d Yoongi admits, staring off into space as Jin chuckles delightedly, settling back into the couch. \u201cAnyway,\u201d Yoongi continues, \u201cWhen I started going to class again, I met a couple of jackasses you may know in Business 101 and realized how good I am with numbers. And so I had friends, and I had a pathway to a well-paying job, and I still had the things I loved to do, even if it wasn\u2019t how I\u2019d always imagined doing them.\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019re happy, then?\u201d Jin asks, swallowing visibly as he pivots his body to Yoongi.\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d Yoongi admits, looking past Jin, at the ugly art on the wall behind his head. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d he asks in an attempt to shift the focus of the conversation. \u201cLiving the dream?\u201d\n\u201cI guess,\u201d Jin contemplates quietly. \u201cI never really wanted to be anything specific, just\u2026 successful. Drifted in the direction of corporate finance based on the promise of vague success, accepted the first job I was offered after graduation, and never left,\u201d Jin says simply. \u201cIt\u2019s been\u2026 Wow it\u2019s been six goddamn years.\u201d\nYoongi whistles and raises his eyebrows. \u201cSix of your\u00a0best\u00a0years,\u201d he notes helpfully.\n\u201cShut the hell up. I\u2019m only getting better with age,\u201d Jin shoots back, shaking the hair off of his forehead.\n\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know how you lasted six years with this job. You, of all people,\u201d Yoongi ponders aloud, feeling himself slide right into that sweet spot in his alcohol consumption, the spot where he\u2019s confident and insightful and uninhibited.\n\u201cWhy \u2018me of all people?\u2019 I\u2019m good at what I do.\u201d\n\u201cSure you are,\u201d Yoongi allows, circling the edge of his wine glass with his finger. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t seem very good for you.\u201d\nJin swallows visibly, looking down as he wipes his hands on a paper towel. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cI mean, do you like your job?\u201d\nJin scoffs and smiles. \u201cWhat kind of a question is that?\u201d\n\u201cA really straight-forward one,\u201d Yoongi says with furrowed brows. \u201cSo do you?\u201d\nJin clicks his tongue and rolls his head back in irritation. \u201cIt suits me very well.\u201d\n\u201cThat is not a \u2018yes.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cWell, what do you want me to say?\u201d Jin bursts out in indignation.\n\u201cI want you to say that you hate your job. Which you clearly do.\u201d\n\u201cIt suits me,\u201d Jin repeats, glancing down as his fingers play with the stem of his wine glass.\n\u201cIt does not,\u201d Yoongi retorts. \u201cThe constant moving, the drifting? No way does that suit you.\"\n\u201cHey, what\u2019s wrong with drifting?\u201d Jin counters loudly, the wine clearly having taken control of the knob on his volume control as he settles back into the couch. \u201cDrifting is nice. A new city every month. Life just makes the decisions for you. Well, Corporate does, anyway. It\u2019s simple. Easy.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s easy for a reason,\u201d Yoongi mumbles into his wine, and he feels rather than sees Jin\u2019s eyes on his face. Yoongi\u2019s eyes flit up nervously over his wine glass, and sure enough, Jin is looking right into his face.\nHis eyes sparkle black in the dimly lit room, and Yoongi almost thinks he\u2019s made a mistake. But then Jin smiles, a weird tension lingering around his eyes, though his laugh is light.\u00a0 \u201cWell aren\u2019t you just a regular Dr. Phil when you\u2019re drunk?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not drunk,\u201d he replies, prickling up defensively. The space between them is dense, smaller than he had originally thought, and Yoongi realizes how tense his body has become. He licks his lips nervously, heart thrumming to life through his clothes when Jin lowers his eyes to Yoongi\u2019s mouth to follow the motion. The movement of his eyes is lazy, glazed and honest with alcohol. \u201cI\u2019m just not bullshitting you. You\u2019re probably not used to the feeling.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what is\u00a0that\u00a0supposed to mean?\u201d Jin demands, an incredulous smile on his face.\nYoongi scoffs, hiding his discomfort in his wine glass. The dry red is just on the side of too dry, a little bitter on his tongue. \u201cNothing.\u201d\n\u201cNo, please do go on, Doctor,\u201d Jin encourages him, forcing a chuckle and encroaching further on Yoongi\u2019s space.\n\u201cOh come on,\u201d Yoongi blusters a little, \u201cThat face? That smile? God- even the nature of your job. You think that anyone around you is ever willing to tell it to you like it is? You think anyone even looks hard enough or long enough to see anything but-\u201d he waves his hand flippantly in the direction of Jin\u2019s generally stunning visage \u201c- all of this? They\u2019re all under your little spell.\u201d\nBut Yoongi thinks that maybe he really did fuck up this time, because there is a harsh ugly line marrying the soft planes of Jin\u2019s face, a crack in the smooth marble of his forehead, a crease between his brows. Yoongi can\u2019t tell if Jin is just drunk, or mad, or horny, but the intensity of his gaze stirs a fire in his stomach. \u201cBut you\u2019re not?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d he declares, and he wishes his voice hadn\u2019t chosen that exact moment to waiver. Jin smiles then, but it\u2019s not his usual kind smile. It\u2019s lop-sided and smoldering and just on the side of too bitter, like the wine, and something in his black gaze looks like it wants to test Yoongi\u2019s defiant statement.\n\u201cSo then,\u201d Jin says shortly. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d\nFor one terrifying, fleeting second, Yoongi thinks that Jin has just given him permission to kiss him, before he realizes how ridiculous that would be. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cTell it to me like it is.\u201d\nYoongi hesitates, because Jin isn\u2019t relenting in his intensity, isn\u2019t backing away. \u201cYou told me that you move to cope. You drift. But everything about you-\u00a0everything- screams roots.\u201d\n\u201cRoots?\u201d\n\u201cRoots,\u201d Yoongi confirms. \u201cLike... friends. A community. A home. A purpose. A goddamn Karaoke Bar. I don't know. Stuff you can\u2019t really when you\u2019re drifting from place to place.\u201d He still can\u2019t read Jin\u2019s expression, so he just goes on, and his tongue has run away with him again. \u201cI mean, I guess some people can, but not you. You\u2019re like... detached. Completely mobile, ready to pick up and leave at any time. You don't bring anything or anyone with you when you go. And that just doesn\u2019t seem like you.\u201d\n\u201cWell I guess you\u2019d know better than anyone, right? Since you\u2019ve known me for all of two months?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just saying,\u201d Yoongi persist, \u201cIf you\u2019re unhappy, do something about it. Don\u2019t just drift along waiting for it to get better.\u201d\nJin\u2019s face is carefully blank. \u201cWho said I was unhappy?\u201d\n\u201cI \u2026You- You didn\u2019t,\u201d Yoongi backtracks, stomach flipping in panic. \u201cSorry.\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine,\u201d Jin insists with a cheap, artificial brightness, and Yoongi tries not to read too much into his weird smile. \u201cReally, it is. It's an interesting perspective.\u201d\n\u201cJust ignore me. I think I must be drunk after all,\u201d Yoongi says before taking a deep, calming breath. \u201cUh, I should get out of your hair. It's late. Thanks for dinner.\u201d He braces his hands on the couch, preparing to push himself to his feet, but then there is the softest, warmest feeling of skin on the back of his hand, and he knows logically that there is no way that it\u2019s Jin\u2019s hand, but it is.\n\u201cWait,\u201d Jins whispers, like he\u2019s afraid that if he says it quietly enough, it won\u2019t be as humiliating. And Yoongi knows Jin is drunk now, because sober Jin would never allow himself to sound that fucking wounded. \u201cCan you just stay for one more drink? I don\u2019t want to go to sleep yet.\u201d\nHe should leave. He knows that. He also knows he won\u2019t.\n\u201cSure.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJin snores lightly with his head resting on Yoongi\u2019s lap and his mostly empty glass of red wine balanced precariously in his left hand.\nIt feels a little illicit, watching Jin sleep like this. Too intimate. Even though Yoongi sees his dumb, remarkable face daily, he is constantly aware of keeping his gaze light, of stopping his eyes from lingering too long. He is always pulling his focus away, to the dull gray wall, or to Hoseok's face, or to his own chewed nails, like he\u2019ll be burned if he allows himself to look, really look.\nThis is all for good reason, Yoongi thinks. Because now he is drowning in a dangerous haze of red wine and Jin, and he was right. It burns.\nHe shifts to leave, because he has to, but of course Jin's eyes flutter open blearily, and Yoongi is caught.\n\u201cHey. Thank you,\u201d Jin mumbles thickly, eyelids heavy.\n\u201cFor what?\u201d Yoongi asks quietly, watching intently as an impossibly soft smile graces Jin\u2019s delicate features, his lashes fanned out pretty against his skin when he blinks.\n\u201cFor today. It was actually an unusually good birthday.\u201d\n\u201cDespite the manhunt?\u201d\n\u201cDespite the manhunt,\u201d Jin confirms, his eyes gently closing again.\nYoongi doesn\u2019t know why he says it, but he can\u2019t stop himself. \u201cJin?\u201d\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Jin mumbles, his lips barely moving as he slowly drifts back towards his deep wine-induced sleep.\n\u201cAre you?\u201d Yoongi asks, slightly startled when he realizes that Jin cannot in fact read his mind and so he should probably clarify. \u201cHappy?\u201d\nJin snuggles into Yoongi\u2019s thigh, his wry smile rather out of place alongside his otherwise peaceful expression. \u201cSometimes.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI DID IT.\u201d\nYoongi startles so hard that he emits an embarrassing high-pitched squeak, knees crashing against the bottom of his desk as he twitches in shock. His heart rate does not slow when he sees who it is.\nJin looks like he hasn\u2019t slept since Friday, his usually carefully-pressed clothes wrinkled and his hair uncombed.\n\u201cYou did\u2026 what?\u201d Yoongi asks in the steadiest voice he can manage. He had fully expected their Monday morning to be awkward, considering the events of the Jin\u2019s birthday.\nBut if Jin is content to pretend that they didn\u2019t wake up in an embarrassingly intimate embrace on Saturday morning, so is he.\n\u201cI got a meeting with the CFO.\u201d Jin\u2019s eyes are shining in a scary, intense way.\n\u201cOh\u2026 good?\u201d\n\u201cNot just good, Yoongi. Great. We can pitch her the idea of another hiring another accountant. I was thinking about it, and honestly, if we just funnel all of the wasted profits into the salary for another accountant, I think we could make this work.\u201d\n\u201cO\u2026.kay,\u201d Yoongi agrees uncertainly, his enthusiasm tempered by his concern for Jin. \u201cAre you\u2026 good?\u201d\n\u201cMe?\u201d Jin demands, unblinkingly, his right eye twitching tellingly. \u201cI\u2019m great. This is great. Today is the future. Tomorrow is now.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re freaking me out,\u201d Yoongi tells him honestly, rolling back his chair a few inches cautiously. \u201cYou seem\u2026 not okay.\u201d\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Jin seems to realize, backing away slightly. \u201cI haven\u2019t slept in a while, and my brain is floating above my body.\u201d\n\u201cHey, why don\u2019t you like\u2026 sit down for a second.\u201d Yoongi gently guides him to his cubicle. \u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you ate?\u201d\n\u201cLike\u2026\u201d Jin ponders as he flops into his rolling chair, which wobbles slightly under his weight. \u201cHoly hell, Yoongi. I skipped first breakfast.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Yoongi reassures him hurriedly, seeing the panic in Jin\u2019s eyes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not okay,\u201d he moans, eyes wild. \u201cI told you. I don\u2019t skip meals. My body\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah. Microchip. Right. It\u2019s gonna be fine. I, uh, I think there are some pastries in the vending machine downstairs. I\u2019ll\u2026 I\u2019ll be right back. Don\u2019t move.\u201d\n\u201cNow that I\u2019m down, I don\u2019t think I could move even if I wanted to,\u201d Jin mutters, looking utterly dazed. \u201cThe most important meal of the day\u2026 I can never get that meal back, Yoongi\u2026\u201d\n\u201cJust\u2026 stay\u2026\u201d Yoongi urges him, backing away worriedly, then taking off at a light jog towards the stairs.\nAs it turns out, there are several kinds of pastries in the vending machine, and Yoongi impulsively shoves a $20 into the machine, fingers flying as they drop one by one into the retrieval slot. Arms overflowing, he walks briskly up the stairs, too impatient to wait for the elevator even as his legs burn.\nHe bursts through their office door as casually as he can but still breathing hard. Jungkook gives him a suspicious look but thankfully says nothing as Yoongi retreats to their isolation corner. Jin is still right where he left him, leaning back in his office chair and groaning lightly. Adorably pathetic.\nYoongi allows the small avalanche of pastries to spill onto Jin\u2019s desk, grabbing a promising looking Danish and tearing open the wrapper.\n\u201cHere,\u201d he says as he offers it to Jin, whose head rolls forward at the crinkling sound of the wrapper. Jin takes it weakly, but after only a moment\u2019s hesitation, he heatedly crams the entire thing into his mouth. Yoongi just watches, awed at the sheer volume of Jin\u2019s oral cavity. \u201cBetter?\u201d\nJin just groans affirmatively around the pastry.\n\u201cAren\u2019t you the one who usually lectures\u00a0me\u00a0on taking better care of myself?\u201d Yoongi asks, brushing a few crumbs from Jin\u2019s rumpled shirt, then jerking his hand away when he realizes how strangely intimate the gesture seems. His eyes dart up to gauge Jin\u2019s reaction, but if he finds it similarly strange, he conceals it well. \u201cI mean, don\u2019t get me wrong, I appreciate you getting the meeting and everything, but\u2026 Is it really that important?\u201d\n\u201cI just\u2026\u201d Jin starts when he has swallowed enough of the pastry, \u201cReally want to make it better for you... y-you guys,\u201d he adds hastily. \u201cDo some good before I leave.\u201d\nYoongi swallows hard. \u201cYeah, I guess that\u2019s pretty soon, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nJin\u2019s chewing slows, his eyes finding Yoongi\u2019s. \u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose we\u2019d better get to work, then,\u201d Yoongi reasons, eyes flicking down to Jin\u2019s plump, pink lips where a single crumb clings.\nJin straightens up, brushing the crumb from his mouth and turning to shuffle through some papers on his desk. \u201cI\u2019m thinking that we should have a working budget, a budget history, and a visual presentation. I\u2019m heading up to meet her in a couple of weeks. I guess we'll officially be done, then.\u201d\n\u201cA couple of weeks?\u201d Jimin exclaims, but all that\u2019s visible of him from over the half wall is his tiny nose and wide, dismayed eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving in a couple of weeks?\u201d\n\u201cJesus, don\u2019t you people knock?\u201d Yoongi demands, hand clutched over his racing heart.\n\u201cYou want me to knock on your half-wall?\u201d\nYoongi splutters, ignoring the comment. \u201cHow would you like it if I just barged in on you and Tae?\u201d\nJimin considers him seriously for a moment. \u201cSounds kinda hot.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you want, Jimin?\u201d\n\u201cI just wanted to give you these,\u201d Jimin replies, reaching over the cube wall to hand them two envelopes. \u201cYour invitations or the Jammies. Congratulations, you have both been nominated! Jin, you\u2019ll stay long enough to come, right?\u201d\n\u201cI should be able to make it,\u201d Jin reassures him kindly.\n\u201cGood! It\u2019s gonna be lit!\u201d Jimin\u2019s eyes crinkle in glee, and it's clear that he\u2019s beaming even if they can\u2019t see his mouth. \u201cSeeya!\u201d\nWhen he\u2019s gone, Jin opens the envelope in his hand, looking gleeful. \u201cMy first Jammies. I\u2019m both excited and terrified.\u201d His eyes skim the paper then roll back briefly in his head. \u201cIt\u2019s at the Karaoke bar, and the dress code is \u2018Black Ties, Zipped Flies.\u2019 Do they really have to specify?\u201d\n\u201cHave you met us?\u201d Yoongi asks dryly.\nJin considers for a moment. \u201cTrue.\u201d He carefully slides the paper back in its envelope. \u201cActually, this works out really well. The Jammies are right after the big meeting, so it\u2019ll be a good opportunity to say goodbye to everyone. It\u2019s kind of perfect.\u201d\nYoongi swallows down his bitter disappointment, turning back to his desk so that he doesn\u2019t have to see Jin looking so utterly okay with the prospect of leaving.\n\u201cPerfect.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe Party Planning Committee humbly requests additional funds to help spread Christmas cheer and turn the fuck up.\u201d\nTaehyung is wearing a red, blinking Rudolph nose and antlers, and a leash hangs loosely from his neck. Jimin clutches the end of it proudly in his tiny hand.\nYoongi blinks once, lazily. \u201cThe Party Planning Committee can suck my massive-\u201d\n\u201cHey guys, what\u2019s up?\u201d Jin says, appearing in the entrance to Yoongi\u2019s cubicle behind Taehyung and Jimin.\n\u201cOh, hey Jin,\u201d Jimin greets him with a sweet, dangerous smile, shooting him an obnoxious pair of finger guns. \u201cLooking good. Interesting sweater choice.\u201d\n\u201cUh, thanks, Jimin. You guys look\u2026. Festive.\u201d\n\u201cJust trying to bring a little Christmas spirit into this sad, cube-y little world,\u201d Jimin says, giving Tae\u2019s leash a little tug. \u201cActually that\u2019s what we wanted to talk to you about. We need more money for the Christmas party.\u201d\n\u201cYou do realize that he\u2019s the guy who came here to cut our budget, right?\u201d Yoongi drawls passively, flicking the head of his little Kumamon bobblehead with one finger.\n\u201cWhat happened to the money we already gave you?\u201d Jin questions them, expression cautious, borderline suspicious.\n\u201cThose funds have been exhausted,\u201d Taehyung says with a shrug, the movement rattling the metallic closure on his leash.\n\u201cOn?\u201d Jin presses.\n\u201cChristmas-related office expenses,\u201d Jimin replies vaguely.\n\u201cCan you be a little more specific?\u201d Jin requests politely, and honestly Yoongi is impressed with his patience. If this was Namjoon, that little vein in his forehead would be throbbing by now.\n\u201cNot at the present moment,\u201d Taehyung informs them with a serious nod.\n\u201cHow much do you need?\u201d\n\u201c$300?\u201d Taehyung asks, his smile cringing and fearful.\n\u201cWhat the hell do you need $300 for?\u201d Yoongi demands, accidentally flicking his bobblehead too hard and sending it careening across the surface of his slick desk.\n\u201cFood, drink, hookers, blow?\u201d Taehyung ticks off the items on his fingers like it\u2019s the most obvious thing in the world. Jin squints, cautiously appraising Taehyung\u2019s unchanged expression.\nJimin giggles nervously and pats Taehyung gently on the shoulder. \u201cHe\u2019s kidding. What he means to say is that, well\u2026 Ever since the whole thing with Corporate- no offense Jin- the guys have been feeling a little down.\u201d\nHis statement is punctuated by Hoseok\u2019s obnoxious, screaming laughter as it echoes across the office walls.\nJimin pointedly ignores this as he continues. \u201cThe future is just\u2026 so uncertain, so we just wanted to make this an extra special Christmas. I mean, who knows?\u201d His tiny, square eyebrows crinkle sadly, and he looks rather like a kicked puppy. \u201cMaybe this could be our last Christmas together.\u201d\nYoongi rolls his eyes and leans back in his chair. There are a few moments of silence where Jin carefully chews his bottom lip, eyes flicking back and forth between Taehyung and Jimin, then finally over to Yoongi.\n\u201cI can\u2019t justify more money from the company budget,\u201d Jin says carefully, now looking solely at Jimin and Taehyung, whose faces fall spectacularly. It might even be a little sad if it wasn\u2019t so comical. Taehyung\u2019s still-blinking nose has slid part-way down his face, \u201cBut maybe I can help a little.\u201d He reaches into his back pocket, pulling out his wallet and fishing around inside. He holds out several large bills, and Jimin and Taehyung\u2019s faces light up like Christmas trees. \u201cHere. Take it. Merry Christmas,\u201d Jin says sweetly and with a smile that makes Yoongi\u2019s insides feel like warm applesauce.\n\u201cOh, come on!\u201d Yoongi exclaims, eyes trained on the cash in Jin\u2019s hand.\nTaehyung snatches the bills without a second thought and marvels, \u201cDamn, are you looking to adopt a 25-year-old man, Daddy Warbucks?\u201d Jimin elbows him sharply in the ribs, and Taehyung clears his throat. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u00a0make that two\u00a025-year-old men.\u201d\nJimin at least has the decency to look marginally guilty. \u201cAre you sure? That\u2019s a lot of money.\u201d\n\u201cA small price to pay for a bit of Christmas cheer,\u201d Jin assures him with another sweet smile, one that Jimin and Taehyung return tenfold. \u201cBut hey, only booze, okay? Pinky swear?\u201d\n\u201cPinky swear!\u201d they should in tandem, raising their pinky fingers in a solemn oath before retreating quickly to their desks, like they\u2019re afraid that if they stay a moment longer, Jin will change his mind.\nYoongi scoffs half-heartedly, significantly less annoyed than he wishes he was. \u201cYou know they\u2019re playing you, right?\u201d\n\u201cOf course. But it\u2019s Christmas, so I\u2019ll allow it,\u201d Jin replies good-naturedly.\u00a0 \u201cPlus, the company pays me pretty well to do what I do. Believe it not, there aren\u2019t actually all that many qualified people who want the job.\u201d\nYoongi is on the verge of biting back with something brash, but Jin\u2019s smile is a little sad, so he swallows down his words.\n\u201cYou coming to the party, then?\u201d Yoongi asks, trying not to sound too interested.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure I was invited,\u201d Jin says cautiously. \u201cI\u2019m not really one of the gang.\u201d\nYoongi spins around in his chair so that he\u2019s facing away from Jin and hunches over his desk, opening up a random spreadsheet and clicking around without purpose. \u201cIt\u2019s an office party. You\u2019re an employee of the office, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cYeah\u2026 I guess I am,\u201d Jin confirms hesitantly.\n\u201cThen\u2026 whatever\u2026\u201d Yoongi gestures vaguely, his back still turned, face aflame with embarrassment. \u201cYou\u2019re one of the gang.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a moment before Jin speaks. \u201cThanks, Yoongi.\u201d Yoongi scowls at the computer screen when he hears the smile in Jin's voice.\n\u201cYeah, thanks Yoongi.\u201d It\u2019s Hoseok, looking smugger than any man wearing a sexy Santa outfit over his business suit has a right to look. \u201cI was actually on my way over to invite Jin myself, but it looks like you beat me to it. So, you\u2019re coming, right?\u201d He addresses Jin this time.\n\u201cOh, uh. Yeah, if that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s not like I have anywhere else to be.\u201d\n\u201cGreat! It\u2019s tomorrow night at Jimin and Tae\u2019s place, so just be as ready for\u00a0that\u00a0as you can be. And make sure you come ready to overconsume in every possible way. Oh and I will have HR relationship disclosure forms at the party just in case-\u2026. just in case,\u201d he finishes with a saucy wink at Yoongi. \u201cOkay, see you then!\u201d\nYoongi half-rises from his seat as if he\u2019s about to chase Hoseok down and beat his ass, but he ultimately decides against it. As he settles uneasily back into his chair, his eyes happen to catch the clock on his computer.\nIt\u2019s 5:02 pm. On a Friday. He is free of his sexy, unbearable cube-shaped prison. He lunges for his bag without another word, logs out of his computer, and makes blindly to exit from his cubicle.\nAnd collides with something very warm and solid.\nHe stumbles back a few feet, heels catching on the edge of his ugly plastic floor mat, and he\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019s about to get a mouthful of desk until a pair of soft hands steady him.\n\u201cShit, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d Jin apologizes, hands tightening around Yoongi\u2019s arms as Yoongi reels back violently, a natural reaction to physical contact with Kim Seokjin, and succeeds in dragging Jin backwards with him as his ass comes into contact with the surface of his desk. The resulting position finds Yoongi seated on the desk, legs wrapped around Jin, whose hand is splayed on the cube wall to steady them and whose face is far too close for comfort. There is a sharp, biting pain in his ass, but he finds that Jin\u2019s facial proximity is much more immediately pressing issue.\nFor a moment, it\u2019s easier not to move. It\u2019s easier to just sit there and pretend he\u2019s not enjoying the feeling of Jin\u2019s solid body hovering over him, because he knows the second they move, one of them will have to say something, and he has no fucking clue how to walk away from this situation unscathed.\nSo Yoongi says the only thing he can think to say.\n\u201cI stapled my butt.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI hate him,\u201d Yoongi seethes, a glass of eggnog clutched tightly in his fist. Taehyung buzzes around him in a little apron, straightening up the place. \u201cHe laughed\u00a0so\u00a0hard.\u201d\n\u201cCan you blame him? You stapled your own butt. That\u2019s like top 5 best ass-related office incidents of 2016.\u201d\n\u201cHow did that even happen?\u201d Hoseok calls from the kitchen, where Jimin is making him taste the punch. \u201cThat does not seem physically possible.\u201d\n\u201cIt happened,\u201d Yoongi mutters venomously. \u201cThat\u2019s all you need to know.\u201d\n\u201cHe and Jin were totally going at it on his desk,\u201d Jimin explains gently to Hoseok, who is cringing at the taste of the punch. \u201cI saw them before Tae and I left go to buy the booze. Talk about abusing the isolation corner.\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cOh fuck off. That would never happen. Sworn enemy, remember?\u201d\n\u201cAh, of course. That explains why you\u00a0invited\u00a0him here,\u201d Hoseok reasons. \u201cAnd why you bought that expensive cast iron skillet for the Dirty Santa gift exchange despite the fact that a solid majority of our office has been effectively banned from all kitchens, everywhere.\u201d Taehyung high-fives Namjoon in the corner of the room. \u201cYes, it\u2019s all making sense now.\u201d\n\u201cA cast iron skillet is a perfectly reasonable gift with extremely generalized appeal,\u201d Yoongi maintains, inconspicuously shifting the oddly wrapped gift underneath his chair with his foot.\n\u201cYeah and there\u2019s no way you just happened to overhear Jin in the break room last week talking about how he had lost his precious cast-iron skillet in the move.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to explain myself to you,\u201d Yoongi pouts, taking a very large sip of his eggnog and subsequently choking on it. \u201cWow, what the fuck is in this shit, Tae?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno, I just bought store eggnog and poured like two bottles of Everclear in there,\u201d Taehyung says unconcernedly.\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 gritty,\u201d Yoongi marvels, staring at his fingers after picking little bits of something off his tongue. \u201cIs this glitter?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u00a0edible\u00a0glitter,\u201d Jimin assures him from the kitchen. \u201cYou\u2019re very welcome for that, by the way, it was a close call.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s aesthetic,\u201d Taehyung defends himself, apron ruffling his hair as he pulls it off and tosses it into the corner. Jimin picks it up without a word of complaint, brushes it off, and hangs it up on a hook.\nA sharp knock on the door shuts them all up. Taehyung bounds for the door, all the while making a lewd gesture directed at Yoongi. He swings the door open with so much force that it the doorknob slams into the wall. (\u201cWatch it, Asshole,\u201d Jimin scolds him.)\n\u201cSeokjin!\u201d Taehyung greets him in what is obviously meant to be a dignified tone. \u201cSo glad you could make it.\u201d\nYoongi\u2019s stomach clenches uncomfortably. Jin\u2019s chic black sweater and leather jacket stretch across his broad shoulders, hair pushed carefully back. His sparkling eyes sweep the room with caution, finally settling on Yoongi, and Yoongi has no choice, he has to look away. He finds temporary comfort in the subtly shimmering drink in his hand. It\u2019s strangely pleasing.\u00a0Aesthetic, he thinks absently.\n\u201cHey, guys,\u201d Jin says, raising his hand in awkward greeting. He\u2019s got a weirdly wrapped gift tucked under his other arm. Yoongi shifts again so that the very obviously pan-shaped gift behind his feet is obscured further from view.\n\u201cYou look like you need a drink,\u201d Taehyung says, grabbing his arm and leading him to the kitchen. Namjoon switches on some music, and now it feels a little bit more like a party and less like seven guys just sitting the house. Jungkook and Namjoon start bickering quietly over the music selection.\n\u201cI really do,\u201d Jin declares, setting down his gift on the table and glancing nervously at Yoongi. Jimin is by his side in a moment shoving a small cup of lurid, red liquid into his hand.\n\u201cHere, have some punch,\u201d Jimin urges him. \u201cI made it myself.\u201d\n\u201cOh, thanks Jimin,\u201d Jin says as he takes the cup and brings it cautiously to his mouth. A small, anticipatory smile from Jimin has Jin flashing a nervous but accommodating grin and tipping it back into his mouth. For a second, he looks like he\u2019s about to throw up, but he manages to swallow it down politely. \u201cJimin, I say this with a great deal of affection, but what the fuck did you just make me put in my mouth?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s Christmas punch,\u201d Jimin tells him, looking proud.\n\u201cIt\u2019s vodka and red food dye,\u201d Hoseok supplies helpfully, throwing back a cup of Christmas Punch himself and cringing delightedly as it hits his throat.\n\u201cWell, this evening is going to devolve spectacularly,\u201d Jin states with a wild, fearful smile.\nHe\u2019s not wrong. They don\u2019t quite make it to Dirty Santa.\nThe closest they get to Dirty Santa is Jimin drunkenly\u00a0tearing open his own gift, an edible candy thong, and flinging it at Taehyung\u2019s face. This prompts Taehyung to break down into ugly tears, snacking on the underwear as Jimin pats his back consolingly and presses a little kiss to his forehead and the party rages around them.\n\u201cAre you sure they\u2019re not a thing?\u201d comes Jin\u2019s voice from close behind him. Yoongi fights the impulse to turn around.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been like this forever,\u201d he tells him, watching as Jimin wipes the dripping snot from Taehyung\u2019s face, \u201cSince college. Believe me, I would know.\u201d\n\u201cWhat does\u00a0that\u00a0mean?\u201d Jin asks, intrigued. Yoongi spares him a glance and immediately regrets it. His cheeks are flushed an attractive pink, and his eyes are sparkling. It\u2019s like magic, or alcohol.\n\u201cIt means I used to have a thing for Taehyung,\u201d Yoongi admits, and he know he wouldn\u2019t have said a goddamn thing if it wasn\u2019t for the Christmas Punch. \u201cSo I like to think that I was pretty well aware of his relationship status. They are honestly just friends. Close friends.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u00a0used to have a thing for Taehyung?\u201d\nYoongi nods solemly. \u201cI also used to wear a trucker hat. We all make mistakes.\u201d\n\u201cYou know, I actually feel like you and Taehyung would kind of work,\u201d Jin muses, \u201cIn like, a hot, chaotic kind of way.\u201d\n\u201cWell then, you think a lot like 20-year-old Min Yoongi,\u201d he muses before pausing confusedly. \u201cWait\u2026 hot?\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cGuys, me and Jimin have to give you your Christmas presents before I go throw up,\u201d Taehyung insists, throwing an arm around their necks. \u201cCome with me.\u201d\nJin shoots Yoongi a wary look before reluctantly allowing himself to be led back into the bedroom.\n\u201cIs this Taehyung\u2019s house?\u201d Jin whispers covertly to Yoongi once they are free of Taehyung\u2019s sweaty grip, huddled into the dim bedroom.\n\u201cJimin and Tae both live here,\u201d Yoongi whispers right back, glancing around the dark room. A flurry of vague movement and a medley of other hushed voices tell him that the rest of the guys have joined them.\n\u201cThere's only one bed.\u201d\nIt\u2019s an interesting point and one that Yoongi\u2019s brain honestly considers entertaining, until Jimin\u2019s voice jars him from his borderline contemplative state.\n\u201cI guess you\u2019re wondering why we brought you here,\u201d Jimin announces grandly, face obscured in the darkness.\n\u201cTurn on a fucking light,\u201d Hoseok whines beside him.\n\u201cWe will turn on the lights when we damn well feel like it,\u201d Taehyung mutters defensively from the back of the room.\n\u201cHey Tae?\u201d Jimin\u2019s voice comes from in front of him.\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cTurn on the lights.\u201d\n\u201cYou got it, boss.\u201d\nThe brightness is blinding. At first, all Yoongi sees is wriggling little green and red shapes.\nThen there is an affectionate cry of \u201cGarbage!\u201d from somewhere to his right, and Yoongi knows instantly what he is seeing.\n\u201cDid you buy tiny cat sweaters with company money?\u201d Jin asks in quiet wonderment.\n\u201cThat depends on how adorable you think this is,\u201d Jimin replies evasively obviously trying to gauge Jin\u2019s reaction.\nJin doesn\u2019t respond, just gazes on at the squirmy, sweatered little mass of kittens. One in particular stands out, sprawled horizontally across its siblings\u2019 faces as they try to quietly feed. \u201cAw, look, it\u2019s Murderer,\u201d Jin points out softly, and Yoongi feels a swell of affection.\n\u201cWe have now reached the point in kittenhood where you may touch and love the babies,\u201d Taehyung tells them with a gooey smile. \u201cPlease, go forth, and bond.\u201d\nEveryone lunges enthusiastically forward to play with the kittens. Hoseok seems to be offering his uninterested kitten a sip of Christmas Punch, while Namjoon\u2019s sits calmly atop his head. Jungkook just stares at his, until he gets a little teary-eyed and has to look away.\n\u201cPoor Garbage looks like she could use a break,\u201d Jin gently elbows Yoongi, gesturing down to where the remaining squiggly little kitten is currently thrashing gently on her mom\u2019s face.\n\u201cOh, right,\u201d Yoongi starts a little, reaching down and carefully scooping up the warm little ball of cat into his hands. Her thrashing only escalates. \u201cWow, she\u2019s a fiery little one.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s usually the little ones you have to worry about,\u201d Jin muses from beside him, extending a cautious finger to gently scratch at the top of Murderer\u2019s tiny head. Yoongi glares with all of the intensity that he can muster but feels himself physically deflate when he gets a good look at Jin\u2019s affectionate smile. Jin plus kittens is\u00a0a lot.\nHe\u2019s also the only one without a kitten of his own, Yoongi realizes as Murderer sinks her tiny, razor-sharp teeth into his thumb. Jimin, Taehyung, and Garbage already look like a little family, and the rest of the guys are already paired off with their own tiny balls of fluff. Murderer is still thrashing dangerously in Yoongi\u2019s hands, and Jin\u2019s just looking on, affectionately, but at a distance.\n\u201cDo you, uh, want to hold her?\u201d Yoongi offers quietly, extending his hands towards Jin.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Jin responds with a lovely smile, and yep, Yoongi would do anything to see that smile again. Jin reaches forward to carefully cup the kitten in his hands. \u201cThanks.\u201d\nTo Yoongi\u2019s complete and utter surprise, Murderer\u2019s violent thrashing ceases with a surprising haste in Jin\u2019s firm but tender grip.\n\u201cWhat the hell\u2026\u201d he breathes as Jin brings the now serene animal to his cheek and nuzzles it tenderly.\n\u201cI think she likes me,\u201d Jin giggles as the little kitten nuzzles him right back.\n\u201cNot even a fucking murderous cat is immune,\u201d Yoongi mumbles grumpily, but with an edge of awe.\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Jin asks, head snapping up to look at Yoongi.\n\u201cNothing.\u201d\n\u201cAw look at you guys,\u201d Hoseok observes loudly and mockingly from across the room. \u201cBonding over pussy. Nobody would have expected that. Literally nobody.\u201d\nYoongi gropes around for the nearest throw pillow and is about to chuck it in his general direction, until Hoseok clutches his kitten and raises it in front of him like a shield.\n\u201cYou\u2019d better carry that kitten around on a full-time basis, fucker,\u201d Yoongi swears, glaring daggers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s uh\u2026 getting a little crowded in here. I think Murderer needs some air,\u201d Jin says significantly, clearly trying to diffuse to situation. \u201cWhat do you say we show this little killer the world beyond Jimin and Tae\u2019s sex den?\u201d\n\u201cTheir what?\u201d Hoseok scoffs in amused disbelief, resting his arm on one of the company\u2019s industrial-sized containers of lube. The movement jostles the metal fastener of the reindeer leash, which hangs loosely from one of the bed posts.\n\u201cCome on, Yoongi,\u201d Jin urges, gently tugging him away, stepping gingerly over the rest of the guys, who are sprawled out on the floor, kittens crawling all about. Yoongi allows himself to be led, staring intently at his own hand in Jin\u2019s. Hoseok wolf-whistles mockingly, and Yoongi kicks out on instinct, his foot narrowly missing Hoseok\u2019s face because Jin yanks him away just in time.\nJin pulls the door shut behind them, and the loud chatter from inside the bedroom dulls slightly.\n\u201cI know you probably weren\u2019t actually going to fight him but I figured better safe than sorry.\u201d\n\u201cYou have no clue what I am capable of. I gave him an honest-to-god swirlie once.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s gross, Yoongi.\u201d\nYoongi just shrugs and subsequently trips over the corner of a rug. Jin\u2019s hand on his elbow steadies him, and he waves him off. \u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m not drunk.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026is exactly what a drunk person would say,\u201d Jin adds quietly, stepping carefully over the wreckage of the living room and making sure that Yoongi doesn\u2019t trip as they make their way towards the balcony door. He slides open the door, and the two off them step out into the brisk night. Jin gently plucks Murderer off his shoulder and tucks her securely into his jacket to shelter her from the cold and wind.\n\u201cYou guys sure know how to throw a party.\u201d\n\u201cYou should see our Easter bash. Utter debauchery,\u201d Yoongi swears, huddling his jacket closer around his thin body and leaning on the railing in front of him. \u201cYou ever seen a man in a giant carrot costume taking a body shot off of the Easter Bunny?\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019ve had the pleasure.\u201d\nYoongi flips through a few of the albums on his phone until he finds what he\u2019s looking for. He angles the screen towards Jin. \u201cNow you have.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do all of the photos you take look vaguely like fetish porn?\u201d Jin marvels as he tilts his head to get a better look.\nYoongi just shrugs, pocketing his phone. \u201cIt\u2019s a gift, I guess.\u201d\nJin stifles a chuckle. \u201cYou seem to be a man of many gifts,\u201d he says, an odd tone of superiority in his voice, \u201cGloss.\u201d\nYoongi\u2019s head whips around so fast that his neck actually cracks. \u201cThose bitches.\u201d\nJin cackles gleefully, clapping his hands like a seal.\n\u201cWho told you?\u201d\n\u201cNobody, actually. Tae was actually listening to some of your tracks in the breakroom one day, and I asked who it was. His face told me enough.\u201d He pulls out his own phone now, fingers flying for a second before he offers the device to Yoongi. \u201cI found your SoundCloud.\u201d\nYoongi groans, draining his drink in one go. \u201cFuck.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s really good, Yoongi,\u201d Jin assures him, trying to catch his eye to emphasize his sincerity. \u201cReally good.\u201d\n\u201cI know it\u2019s good,\u201d Yoongi snaps. \u201cGenius, remember?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing new on here\u00a0since 2012. Is that when you stopped?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t\u2026 stop,\u201d Yoongi grunts, \u201cI still write and produce. Just, not for myself.\u201d\n\u201cSpotlight wasn\u2019t for you?\u201d Jin asks, and it would be very easy to think that Jin was teasing him, if Yoongi didn\u2019t know better. He makes the mistake of looking at Jin, whose gaze is heavier\u00a0and more appraising than his tone would suggest.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have the temperament for it,\u201d he acknowledges, careful with his words. \u201cI\u2019m hyper-critical, antisocial, and prone to obsession.\u201d\n\u201cSounds like a lot of artists.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, and why do you think so many artists self medicate?\u201d\n\u201cTrue,\u201d Jin allows. Then, with a forced air of lightness, \u201cIs that, uh, what you did?\u201d\nYoongi takes a larger than necessary sip of his heinous drink to buy himself just a few extra seconds. \u201cI wasn\u2019t suited for scene like that. Especially since I was going it alone and refusing to ask for help.\u201d He pauses, picking hard at his nails. \u201cIt was brutal and volatile and just\u2026wild. Too many bad ways to cope. But people don\u2019t throw around serious terms when you\u2019re young, you know? You\u2019re just young. Enjoying the life.\u201d\nJin just nods understandingly and subtly shifts a little closer. Yoongi appreciates the barely-there contact, but he hopes his face doesn\u2019t betray him. \u00a0\u201cAnd now?\u201d\n\u201cNow\u2026 I\u2019m not alone.\u201d He says simply, jerking his head in the vague direction of the apartment behind them. Yoongi can hear Hoseok's muted screaming coming from inside, followed by a screeching laughter. His heart gives an affectionate pang.\u00a0\n\u201cThey really do love you, you know,\u201d Jin adds softly, shifting so that the kitten in his jacket is no longer slipping. \u201cPlus, now you\u2019ve got this little one, too.\u201d\n\u201cShe is pretty cute, isn\u2019t she?\u201d Yoongi coos, turning towards Jin so that he can scratch the head of the tiny dosing kitten, as it peeks out from Jin\u2019s jacket. If he was sober, he would probably be cognizant of the fact that he is, in fact, too close to Jin, but as it is he remains ignorant. That is, until Jin cranes his head down to try to get a better look for himself, and wow he\u2019s close.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted a cat,\u201d Jin confesses, and maybe he\u2019s ignorant of their proximity too, because neither of them is moving away.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you get one?\u201d\n\u201cWhy else? My job. I travel too much.\u201d\nYoongi feels his lip curl in displeasure, turning away to face the balcony as he grumbles under his breath.\n\u201cYoongi, you are not grumbling nearly as quietly as you seem to think you are.\u201d Yoongi\u2019s ears are on fire, the cold breeze licking bitterly at them, and it's a strange sensation. \u201cCome on, out with it,\u201d Jin prompts him.\n\u201cNot my business,\u201d Yoongi refuses shortly, remembering the last time they had this conversation.\n\u201cOh, come on,\u201d Jin prompts him. \u201cYou\u2019re my friend. I value your opinion.\u201d\nYoongi is very conscious of the fact that Jin can probably\u00a0hear\u00a0his audible gulp. He heaves a great sigh, the cold air burning his lungs. \u201cWell, you already know my opinion on this.\u201d\n\u201cOn what? Roots?\u201d There is a clear, teasing tone in Jin\u2019s voice, so Yoongi just twitches a stiff, awkward nod in response. \u201cThis sounds suspiciously a lot like caring, Min Yoongi,\u201d Jin goads him gently.\nYoongi rolls his eyes and scuffs his foot against the concrete. \u201cIt's just fucking dumb is all.\u201d He can feel Jin staring at him, and he feels like he\u2019s melting into a tiny useless puddle on the floor. \u201cI mean, dude, you\u2019re basically built for roots. People like you, you just like\u2026 fell into our group like you\u2019ve always been there. You could have a real home\u2026 with a stupid cat. You could have-\u201d He breaks off with an impulsive, dangerous word on his tongue.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Jin pushes, still smiling, but his eyes have gone very sharp and serious as he orients his body towards Yoongi.\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Yoongi says quickly. \u201cI dunno.\u201d\n\u201cI could have what, Yoongi?\u201d Jin breathes, and his smile is gone. The air around him feels less bitterly cold, and Yoongi realizes it\u2019s because Jin is so close now.\n\u201cI mean, haven\u2019t you\u2026\u201d Yoongi starts. He knows he\u2019s staring at Jin\u2019s lips, but he has a feeling that looking into Jin\u2019s eyes would be even more dangerous. \u201cHaven\u2019t you ever\u00a0been tempted to try?\u201d Yoongi probes in what the Christmas Punch assures him is a subtle approach. \u201cTo just\u2026 try?\u201d he ends lamely.\nJin seems to be considering something carefully, and the silence is maddening. He chews on his bottom lip, and that\u2019s officially too much. Yoongi balks, panicking, and he\u2019s looking into Jin\u2019s eyes. Trapped.\n\u201cOf course I have,\u201d Jin confirms after what feels like an eternity.\n\u201cThen why don\u2019t you?\u201d Yoongi asks him, shuffling a half-step forward and fully expecting Jin to back away. He doesn\u2019t.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Jin almost whispers, his faces suddenly much closer than Yoongi had thought it was, and if anyone had told Yoongi that he would ever see these lips this close up, he would have called them a liar. \u201cI\u2019m a fucking coward.\u201d\nJin's going to kiss him. Even as he warns Yoongi off, pushes him away, he\u2019s going to kiss him, and Yoongi knows it. Jin\u2019s breath puffs hot against his mouth, even hotter in the frigid air around them. Yoongi is terrified, frozen in place, closer to Jin than is physically comfortable. This is distinctively uncomfortable and wonderful and terrifying.\nA jarring squelching noise like skin against glass startles them, and they scramble madly away from each other before turning to see five desperately interested faces pressed against the sliding glass door. Their audience scatters comically fast, tripping over each other in a drunken effort to get away. Jungkook does a lop-sided somersault and goes crashing into the coffee table.\n\u201cFuck. Um. I\u2019m actually gonna get going,\u201d Jin says abruptly, pulling the kitten out of his jacket and handing her to Yoongi hurriedly. He sounds slightly out of breath.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Yoongi mumbles, hands scrambling to secure Murderer in his grasp.\n\u201cYeah, uh. Sorry, just. S-see you Monday,\u201d Jin stutters, striding past, head tucked.\n\u201cOh hiya, Jin! So weird running into you like this-\u201d Hoseok\u2019s muted voice comes from inside when Jin slides open the door and steps through. Then there is a click, then there is silence. He leaves one impossibly confused and conflicted Yoongi in his wake.\nYoongi allows himself a few moments to collect himself, petting his cat mindlessly.\n\u201cNow listen,\u201d Hoseok cautions him, his own kitten raised in front of him like a protective barrier as Yoongi enters the apartment, \u201cI know we basically just collectively cock-blocked you, but hear me out.\u201d\nYoongi heaves a great sigh and collapses weakly onto the couch. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t gonna happen anyway,\u201d he admits, letting his head fall back onto the cushion.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Hoseok demands, hopping eagerly onto the couch now that he knows Yoongi\u2019s not mad. \u201cWhy?\u201d\nBecause Yoongi is a fucking idiot. Because that asshole has fucking commitment issues, and because even if he didn\u2019t, several hotness leagues would still separate them. Because on what planet would Kim Seokjin ever be into him. \u201cBecause he\u2019s my mortal enemy,\u201d Yoongi bluffs unconvincingly, and Hoseok pats him sympathetically on the shoulder.\n\u201cSure he is, buddy.\u201d\n\u201cHey, who brought this present?\u201d Namjoon asks, clumsily shaking a weird, shittily-wrapped gift. Without another moment of consideration, Namjoon tears through the paper, shredding it into tiny, useless pieces that litter the floor. Inside is a box, and inside the box is-\n\u201cA fucking plant?\u201d Namjoon whines in disappointment, pulling a small, spiky green thing out of the box. Yoongi\u2019s throat is tight, and his heart flutters away like a hummingbird. It\u2019s just a plant, he tells himself. It could be for anyone. It could be from anyone.\n\u201cWho the hell would bring a plant to Dirty Santa?\u201d Hoseok demands, squatting to get a better look at the tiny pot in Namjoon\u2019s hand.\n\u201cJin, I think. I'm pretty sure his present was the only one unaccounted for,\u201d\u00a0Jungkook adds from the corner, legs slung over the armrest of a chair as his kitten snuggles into his chest.\nDoesn\u2019t mean a thing, Yoongi assures himself. They had one conversation about plants. Once. Doesn\u2019t mean a thing. Probably.\n\u201cWhat the hell is wrong with it? Is it fake?\u201d Jungkook asks, snatching it from Namjoon\u2019s hands an examining it.\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s real. Just weird looking. It\u2019s a succulent,\u201d Namjoon clarifies. \u201cIt\u2019s kind like a cactus. You barely have to water it.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s like the Yoongi of plants,\u201d Jimin pipes up from the kitchen, where he is washing dishes. \u201cSmall, tough, and weird looking.\u201d\nYoongi reminds himself give Jimin a swift thwack to the back of the head later, but right now, he is in the process of trying and failing to suppress his glee, because Jin bought that dumb fucking plant for him. He bought him a dumb fucking plant which even Yoongi couldn\u2019t kill, because Yoongi had said he missed the green. Which means that Jin was thinking of him, which means\u2026 What the hell does it mean?\nRather than pondering the question, Yoongi finds himself shoving a still-drowsy Murderer into Hoseok's hands and wrenching open the front door before anyway can stop him.\nIt\u2019s freezing, colder than the balcony by far, and he\u2019s left his jacket inside, he realizes. But the important thing is that Jin is stepping into a taxi, and Yoongi\u2019s going to miss him.\n\u201cHey asswipe!\u201d Smooth Yoongi, real smooth. But it works. Jin freezes as he\u2019s lowering himself into the cab, squinting hard to see who is heckling him. Yoongi takes the opportunity to trot over and put his hand on the door to keep it from closing. \u201cEscort me home.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Jin asks, baffled.\n\u201cI\u2019m tiny, drunk, and pretty. Escort me home.\u201d\nJin can\u2019t help but laugh, stepping out of the way and motioning for Yoongi to get into the cab. \u201cWhere to, tiny drunk one?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo you want to come up for coffee?\u201d Yoongi asks delicately. He vaguely remembers that his place is an actual mess, but that seems unimportant at the moment. They are idling outside his apartment as the taxi driver eyes them suspiciously in the front seat.\n\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea, Yoongi.\u201d\nYoongi heaves a sigh, trying to read Jin\u2019s face for any sign of relenting. He doesn\u2019t find one. \u201cYou think too goddamn much,\u201d Yoongi mumbles grumpily, fumbling for the door handle. \u201cWhatever. Bye.\u201d\nHe steels himself for the cold and slams the car door behind him, bracing himself against the wind as he trudges up to the entrance of his apartment building. It is several moments before he notices the sound of another pair of footsteps in addition to his own, and then a wide shadow joins his own on the building's wall.\n\u201cGod it's cold,\u201d Jin complains as Yoongi struggles with his keys.\nEven in the warmth of his apartment, Yoongi\u2019s hands still shake. They shake as he tosses his keys into the bowl on the front table, and they shake as he flips the light switch on, revealing a nervous looking Jin loitering in his doorway. The door is still slightly ajar behind him, like he knows that the minute it closes, something will change.\nYoongi is not accustomed to sudden bursts of courage, but he guesses that he has the Christmas Punch to thank for this one.\n\u201cFor fuck's sake,\u201d he mutters, striding over to where Jin stands and slamming the door behind him. And then somehow Jin\u2019s back hits the wood with a gentle thud, and his beautiful leather jacket is in Yoongi\u2019s hands, then on the floor.\nYoongi hesitates only long enough to locate Jin's lips.\nAnd then Yoongi is moaning openly into Jin\u2019s mouth as his hands scramble for a grip on those shoulders, pulling their bodies flush and feeling the heat radiating from Jin\u2019s core even as his ice cold fingers grip at the back of Yoongi\u2019s neck. And thank god, Yoongi must have actually read the situation right, because Jin's nails are digging into his skin as his tongue drags hotly against Yoongi\u2019s.\nYoongi would be embarrassed of how fast he gets hard, if he didn\u2019t feel Jin's own throbbing hardness pressing into his thigh. He shifts so that their erections are pressed together, and the sound that Jin makes in the back of his throat makes Yoongi want. Yoongi just wants and he wants, and he never wants to stop kissing Jin, until he realizes that there is actually one thing he actually wants a hell of a lot more.\nHis knees hit the wood floor so hard that he knows he is going to bruise tomorrow, but the anticipation of having Jin's cock in his mouth is more than enough to distract from the pain. Jin seems momentarily confused about what is happening, but by the time that Yoongi has undone his belt and ripped down his zipper, he seems to have caught up.\n\u201cFuck, Yoongi\u2026\u201d and Yoongi takes that as encouragement, yanking down Jin\u2019s underwear, watching with delight as his thick, pink cock springs free. His mouth waters at the sight. \u201cYoongi, stop.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Yoongi asks, bewildered.\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Jin mutters, face splotchy and hands trembling as he tucks himself back into his pants and zips them up. \u201cI'm sorry.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 confused,\u201d Yoongi says, rocking back on his heels. \u201cDid you think we were actually going to have coffee?\u201d\nJin shakes his head. \u201cNo, I just\u2026 I\u2019m leaving. In a week.\u201d\n\u201cYes. A fact that we were both well aware of prior to now,\u201d Yoongi scoffs, pushing himself to his feet and feeling his erection straining almost painfully against his jeans. \u201cRight?\u201d\n\u201cYes, but-\u201c\n\u201cSo what's wrong?\u201d\n\u201cI just\u2026 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea,\u201d Jin says vaguely, trying to smooth his ruffled hair.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Yoongi growls, heat prickling around his ears. \u201cSo why the hell did you even come up here?\u201d he demands, but Jin just purses his lips, stuffing his hands into his pockets and rocking back on his heels slightly. Yoongi knows he\u2019s not going to get an answer, and he swallows down a surge of anger. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m asking you to fucking marry me. This is not a big deal.\u201d\u00a0He feels kind of ugly as he says it, and Jin actually seems to bristle, straightening up to his full height, his swollen lips pursing together primly.\n\u201cThen I guess it won\u2019t be a big deal if I leave.\u201d\nIt\u2019s like a cold, unpleasant stone dropping in his stomach, but he maintains his stony mask. \u201cBe my goddamn guest.\u201d He gestures to the door dramatically, ignoring the pang in his chest.\nJin just stands there for a moment, uncertainly chewing his lip, hair still adorably ruffled. \u201cYoongi\u2026\u201d he starts, but then he seems to think better of saying whatever it is he was about to say. Instead, he picks his jacket up off the floor and shrugs it on in the smothering silence. \u201cNever mind,\u201d he mutters, and his voice is unbearably hard.\nYoongi just opens the door in silence and stares hard at the wall, hating himself even as he does it. Jin hesitates, clearly wanting to say something more, but Yoongi won\u2019t give him the satisfaction of anything that could be construed as encouragement. Finally, he sighs heavily and seems to give up, walking out through the door, head tucked, without another word.\nYoongi makes sure to slam the door loudly behind him.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYoongi hasn\u2019t been in a mood like this in years, and everybody knows it. On Monday morning, when he opens the door so hard that it slams against the wall, trudging through the entryway with his head down and headphones in, Hoseok breathes a small \u2018Uh oh.\u2019\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Namjoon questions him quietly as they watch Yoongi toss his bag into the corner of the cubicle, not sparing a glance to a rigid-backed Jin.\n\u201cRemember the narrowly avoided Taepocalypse of 2010?\u201d Hoseok asks them, craning his head to get a better look at Yoongi as he stomps to his cubicle.\n\u201cWho could forget that fucking disaster?\u201d Jimin mumbles, nuzzling his head into Taehyung's shoulder.\n\"Well I think we're too late to head off Hurricane Yoonjin.\u201d\n\u201cNoo,\u201d Jimin whines, \u201cAll that work for nothing?\u201d\n\u201cAre you guys thinking what I\u2019m thinking?\u201d Taehyung pipes up from beside Jimin, clasping his hand gently.\n\u201cThat we have meddled too much already and need to let this ship die a dignified death?\u201d Hoseok asks hopefully.\n\u201cHell no,\u201d Taehyung exclaims, looking offended. \u201cDon\u2019t you want him to be happy? This is happening. We just need to take it up a notch. We've barely scratched the surface here.\u201d\n\u201cBe careful, Tae,\u201d Hoseok warns. \u201cI\u2019m all for meddling, but he\u2019s my best friend and he\u2019s much more delicate than he looks.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s my best friend, too, asshole,\u201d Tae growls, ignoring a pointed elbow from Jimin. \u201cSo leave me to my work.\u201d He switches his focus to Jungkook, who is leaning against his cube, pretending that he isn\u2019t listening to the whole exchange. \u201cHey, you. Young one. I require your expertise.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDay one post-Christmas party is awkward at times and excruciatingly awkward at others. Apparently, Yoongi learns with dismay, he and Jin have synced up piss schedules, leading to two separate but equally awful trips to the bathroom where they stand side by side, holding their dicks in a thick, tense silence.\nWorse yet, they still have to finish the budget. Yoongi may be pissed and bitter, but he recognizes that he still needs Jin to talk to Corporate on their behalf. So instead of opting to be the bigger human by sucking it up and walking over to Jin to ask him how he wants to divvy up their remaining work, he decides to send a short, frigid email outlining the remaining tasks. To a man sitting 8 feet away.\nWhen he hears the little ping of Jin's email go off, he freezes, straining his ears for a reaction. He hears nothing for a few seconds, then there\u2019s the sound of Jin\u2019s chair rolling abruptly back, his heavy, angry footsteps becoming gradually quieter as he wrenches open the door and presumably disappears from the office.\n\u201cDamn dude. What the fuck happened?\u201d Hoseok asks, appearing suddenly at his cube entrance.\n\u201cNothing happened. Nothing was ever\u00a0going\u00a0to happen, and nothing will ever fucking happen again,\u201d Yoongi growls through gritted teeth.\n\u201cAgain? I thought you said nothing happened.\u201d\nYoongi just buries his head in his hands and exhales hard. \u201cPlease go away.\u201d\n\u201cCome on, dude.\u201d\nYoongi slams down his pen and scoots his chair back abruptly. \u201cJESUS fuck, Hoseok. Can you just let me be for once in your goddamn life?\u201d he snaps, brushing past a shocked looking Hoseok. \u201cTell Namjoon I\u2019m working from home,\u201d he mumbles as he heads off to find Jungkook so that he can check out a company laptop.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAt least he doesn\u2019t feel quite as ridiculous emailing Jin from the comfort of his blanket burrito at home. Well, he still feels ridiculous, just in a different way.\nHoseok shows up that night with McDonalds and beer. Yoongi mumbles an embarrassed apology for snapping at him earlier, but Hoseok has long forgiven him.\n\u201cSo why the hell did he even go to your place?\u201d Hoseok asks him, mouth full of fries, after Yoongi has recounted his story.\n\u201cI don\u2019t fucking know. At least he stopped me before I actually had his dick in my mouth.\u201d He pauses, then adds \u201cThough it would not be the first time I\u2019d been dumped with a dick in my mouth.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe he\u2019s just really conflicted. Like his dick says yes but his brain says no?\u201d\n\u201cHis dick was definitely saying yes,\u201d Yoongi confirms, flopping over onto the couch with a groan and retreating into his burrito. \u201cHoseok, he has a really nice dick.\u201d\n\u201cCan you be a little more specific? Girth? Color? Length? Veins?\u201d\n\u201cYou are fucking disgusting,\u201d Yoongi spits, sitting up abruptly, his hair a wreck from the static of his blankets. He sighs and glances at Hoseok, looking guilty. \u201cSo let me be clear that I\u2019m only telling you because I\u00a0really\u00a0want to talk about it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Namjoon rarely plays the boss card, but he makes Yoongi comes back to work that Thursday so that they\u00a0can have a meeting about the presentation before Jin leaves.\n\u201cI promise I\u2019ll be there. To mitigate the awkwardness,\u201d Namjoon assures him over the phone. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t ask if this wasn\u2019t important, Yoongi. We need this. And look, Jin\u2019s leaving like immediately afterwards so that he has time to drive up and check into his hotel before the meeting with the CFO tomorrow.\u201d\nYoongi makes sure to look extra hot on Thursday morning, wearing his most apathetic mask and his tightest pants. Nothing bothers Min Yoongi. Except these pants. They kind of crush his balls. Worth it.\nYoongi comes in late then spends the first hour of his day hiding in Hoseok's cubicle. \u201cBuddy, it's already two minutes past nine.\u00a0It's about that time. I think they're waiting for you,\u201d Hoseok says as he pushes Yoongi\u2019s butt off of his desk with his foot. Yoongi groans but allows himself to be pushed, catching himself with his feet at the very last moment before he falls. He grabs his laptop and halfheartedly kicks the wheel of Hoseok's chair before shuffling towards the meeting room.\n\u201cFuuuck,\u201d he\u00a0groans to no one in particular, shuffling his feet as he trudges miserably down the bleak hallway.\nJin looks put-together as always, though a little tired. Namjoon is there, smiling brightly, and wow does he look uncomfortable. His smile is big and fake, and his eyes are wide as they dart back and forth between Jin and Yoongi.\n\u201cHow\u2019s my dream team doing?\u201d Namjoon asks jovially as Yoongi plops into the seat next to him, the chair creaking violently. Jin just grimaces in the vague form of a smile, and Yoongi rolls his eyes. \u201cOkay, great,\u201d Namjoon continues bravely in the hostile silence. \u201cSo what have you guys got?\u201d\n\u201cUh, well I outlined the budget, and Yoongi's got the presentation,\u201d Jin says stiffly, and Yoongi\u2019s stomach clenches at the sound of his own name. \u201cLet me just pull it up.\u201d A couple of seconds pass, then his brow creases in confusion. \u201cOkay\u2026 that\u2019s weird. Where\u2019s the file?\u201d\nYoongi\u2019s blood runs a little cold as he scrambles for his own laptop, clicking into his documents tab and knowing full well before it even opens that he is not going to find what he\u2019s looking for.\nThe folder is empty. It was not empty last night.\nRage swells within him.\n\u201cKIM. TAE. HYUNG.\u201d\n\u201cYoongi, no. Yoongi, sit down,\u201d Namjoon urges him, tugging insistently on his arm. \u201cWe don\u2019t know anything yet. Let\u2019s just get Jungkook in here so he can figure out what\u2019s up. Maybe the company drive is down. You saved it on the company drive, right?\u201d\n\u201cThey company drive is not down, Namjoon! Everything else is here, and he has pulled this shit before. That little fucking monster, I\u2019m going to strangle him with his own goddamn tie.\u201d\n\u201cJungkook?\u201d Namjoon calls loudly, clearly afraid to let Yoongi out of his sight. \u201cCan you come in here for a second?\u201d\nThirty seconds later, Jungkook wanders in looking bored as hell. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cUh, we seem to be experiencing some technical difficulties.\u201d\n\u201cDid you try turning it off and turning it back on?\u201d Jungkook asks dully, looking at his nails.\n\u201cDo you want to die too, kid?\u201d Yoongi snarls as Namjoon's grip on his arm tightens.\n\u201cYoongi, chill,\u201d Namjoon urges him, before turning back to Jungkook. \u201cUh, Jungkook, it's not really that kind of problem. I think it might be something with the company drive. Yoongi and Jin can\u2019t find their budget report for the big meeting tomorrow.\u201d\nJungkook's eyes widen, and he doesn\u2019t look bored anymore. \u201cOh. Is that what that was?\u201d\n\u201cIs that what WHAT was?\u201d Yoongi mutters through his teeth.\n\u201cThe thing that Taehyung had me hack in and delete,\u201d Jungkook says sheepishly, the usual gold of his cheeks glowing a dull red.\n\u201cKIM TAEHYUNG.\u201d\nNamjoon can\u2019t hold him back this time. Yoongi wrenches his arm from his grasp and is out the meeting door before anyone can stop him.\nHe catches a glimpse of Taehyung's pant leg before it disappears around the corner, and Yoongi has no clue why he\u2019s running, because that\u2019s a dead end. Taehyung seems to have just come to this realization himself when Yoongi rounds the corner. Taehyung catapults himself into the supply room, and before he can close the door, Yoongi is there, wincing as Taehyung tries desperately to close to door on his foot.\n\u201cYou little fucker!\u201d Yoongi yells, prying open the door in an amazing show of strength.\nTaehyung crumples, scrambling backwards on the floor, and Yoongi steps inside and slams the door behind them, locking it for good measure. Yoongi grins at the sound of bodies thudding against the other side of the door.\n\u201cYoongi, don\u2019t kill him! He\u2019s the face of the company!\u201d comes Namjoon\u2019s muffled voice through the wood.\nYoongi launches at Taehyung, and roll messily on the floor as they struggle for the upper hand. They don\u2019t struggle long.\n\u201cHow are you so tiny and strong?\u201d Taehyung despairs as his arms are pinned down by Yoongi\u2019s hands. Yoongi is breathing hard, but now that he\u2019s got him here, he doesn\u2019t know what to do with him. He settles for flicking him hard on the forehead. Apparently the sound it makes is loud enough to trigger the clap-activated mood lighting, and Taehyung giggles before screwing up his face in pain. \u201cOuch! Stop! Can we just talk about this?\u201d\n\u201cTalk about what, Tae? Talk about how you have just single-handedly fucked over this entire branch? How you have just single-handedly fucked me over? You wanna talk about that?\u201d he emphasizes his words with another powerful flick to the forehead. The room goes dark.\n\u201cLook, okay, when you put it that way, it sounds really bad, but listen. Can I just tell you why I did it?\u201d\n\u201cI fucking know why you did it, Tae! Because you can\u2019t leave well enough alone. Because you have some weird guilt about breaking my heart and now you think it's your goddamn life's mission to fix me. Well guess what. Stop. Trying. To. Help!\u201d He punctuates ever word with a flick, and the lights are going crazy. It's so ridiculous that Yoongi wants to laugh. He also wants to cry.\nTaehyung looks he actually might.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Taehyung murmurs, his lip trembling pathetically. And God, even if Yoongi is mad, he can\u2019t tolerate seeing Kim Taehyung cry. He is poised to flick again, but his hand falls limply by his side as he rolls off of Taehyung and slumps against a fall, breathing hard.\n\u201cWhy, Tae? It was such a long time ago. I\u2019m over it. I am\u2026 so far\u00a0beyond\u00a0over it.\u201d\nTaehyung actually sniffles, and Yoongi swallows down his guilt. \u201cI just want you to be happy. I haven\u2019t seen you smile like you do around Jin since\u2026since\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSince college,\u201d Yoongi supplies for him, saving them both the embarrassment. \u201cBut come on, what did you think was going to happen?\u201d\nTaehyung bites his lip. \u201cI just thought, you know, maybe you two would have to stay late to finish everything, and then you\u2019d be such a good team and you\u2019d be so swept up in the romance of the situation that you would realize you\u2019re in love with each other and make tender, kinky love on Namjoon's desk.\u201d\nYoongi doesn\u2019t know why he\u2019s feeling sorry for Taehyung right now, when every instinct tells him he should be feeling sorry for himself. \u201cTae I already tried. He doesn\u2019t want me.\u201d\nTaehyung's mouth falls open very slightly. \u201cOh.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cWell, he\u2019s an idiot if he doesn\u2019t want you,\u201d Taehyung assures him.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t want me either,\u201d Yoongi mutters, and Taehyung's lip trembles again. Yoongi backtracks immediately. \u201cHey, no I\u2019m not\u2026 I really am over it. I\u2019m just\u2026 Fuck, I don\u2019t know why I said that. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nAnd Taehyung looks so endearingly distraught when he says, \"You know it's not that you weren\u2019t\u2026 I mean. It's just\u2026\u201d Taehyung struggles, breathing a shuddery breath, \u201cI already had him.\"\n\u201cHim?\u201d Yoongi pauses, his breath catching in his throat. A million things fall into place at once. A million things that were so obvious, so impossible to ignore, a million things that he somehow managed to pretend weren't happening, suddenly make a hell of a lot of sense. And god, Yoongi\u2019s an idiot. God, they all are. Yoongi just nods, smile soft but wry around the edges. \"Ah.\u201d\n\"But you\u2019ve always been one of my very favorite people. You know that, right?\u201d Taehyung insists, hand clutching at Yoongi's knee.\nYoongi heaves a great sigh. \u201cI know, Tae.\u201d\nThey sit in silence for a moment as Taehyung sniffles again, his fingers digging into Yoongi\u2019s leg.\n\u201cSince this is my fault, can I at least stay and help you tonight?\u201d Taehyung asks pathetically, eyes large and sparkling.\n\u201cPlease do not try to help me with anything ever again. No more meddling. I mean it. If you see me bleeding in a ditch, walk away very slowly.\u201d\n\u201cI love you, too, Yoongi.\u201d\nThey emerge from the supply room several minutes later to a crowd of faces frozen in concern.\n\u201cHe's alive?\u201d Jungkook shouts from his cube, removed from the madness.\n\u201cYep,\u201d Hoseok shouts back, and Jungkook just responds with a thumbs-up before sinking back down behind his wall.\n\u201cUh, Taehyung, did you really delete those documents?\u201d Namjoon questions him seriously. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of a big deal. Like a \u2018report to HR\u2019 kind of big deal.\u201d\n\u201cUh, no. I accidentally did it,\u201d Yoongi lies smoothly. \u201cI thought I was backing them up, but I must have deleted them somehow. Sorry.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Jin's?\u201d Namjoon pushes. Taehyung is uncharacteristically quiet.\n\u201cOh. I think I did the same thing,\u201d Jin confirms, though his lie isn\u2019t as seamless as Yoongi\u2019s. \u201cThat new system is really confusing. I get the H-drive and the J-Drive mixed up.\u201d\n\u201cWhat an amazing coincidence,\u201d Namjoon says dryly. \u201cAre you guys going to be able to get this shit done? It's a lot of work, and the meeting is tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cWe won\u2019t be starting from scratch. I have some of the older printouts lying around here somewhere,\u201d Jin tells him with a reassuring smile. \u201cWe'll get it done, no problem. We'll stay all night it we have to.\u201d\nYoongi scowls at Taehyung, who tries rather unsuccessfully to look small. \u201cYep. All night,\u201d he growls through his teeth.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey work in relative silence, speaking only to clarify or confirm. It's not uncomfortable, exactly. Since the incident with Taehyung earlier, they have managed to shellac a fine layer of bullshit over the deep, simmering tension. Every once in a while, it threatens to bubble up through fissures and cracks in their otherwise meticulously kept fa\u00e7ade.\nBut they\u2019re making progress. Jin was right, they aren\u2019t starting from scratch. Even so, it's still a hell of a lot of work. Yoongi has to remake some of the figures for the PowerPoint, the spreadsheets and the graphs. Jin is behind him, in his cubicle, typing away furiously and silently.\nTaehyung at least has the decency to bring them dinner, long after everyone else has headed home for the night.\nIt's great, because Yoongi realizes belatedly that he hasn\u2019t eaten all day.\nIt's not so great, because he is alone in the office with Kim Seokjin, who not only looks deliciously disheveled with his sleeves rolled up and his hair rumpled by nervous hands, but who also makes sex noises when he eats. It also doesn\u2019t help that Yoongi has also heard his real life sex moan and can attest to the similarity.\nSo he sits there, simmering in his cube, trying in vain to concentrate. Trying desperately to ignore what sounds like Jin going to third base with a piece of pizza.\n\nProjections show that the benefits of an expanded accounting department will far outweigh the costs of...\n\nIt's too easy to imagine.\u00a0Jin gripping Yoongi's hair and moaning lewdly as Yoongi swallows around his cock.\n\nProjections show that the benefits of an expanded accounting department will\u2026\n\nJin bending him over his desk and groaning in satisfaction as he pushes into Yoongi's tight heat, so fucking slowly.\n\nProjections show that\u2026\n\n\u201cOh my god, will you shut the fuck up?\u201d Yoongi explodes, shoving his chair back from his desk and storming off without a look back at a presumably shocked Jin.\nHe flings open the bathroom door and locks himself, steaming, in one of the stalls. He unbuttons his pants and yanks them down furiously, and yep, he\u2019s as hard as he thought he was. Painfully hard, his cock red and throbbing and leaking, and there\u2019s no way he\u2019s going to jerk off in the office, but what the hell\u00a0is he going to do?\n\u201cUh, Yoongi?\u201d\nFuck fuck fuck. He hadn\u2019t even heard the door open.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cIs everything\u2026 okay in there?\u201d\n\u201cJesus Christ, will you please stop pretending to care?\u201d Yoongi mumbles, wincing as he tucks himself back into his pants and tries to situate himself in the least painful position.\n\u201cAre you fucking serious?\u201d Jin demands, scoffing indignantly. \u201cLook, can you at least come out so we can have this conversation?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d and Yoongi knows he sounds like a petulant child, but he really doesn\u2019t want to have this conversation at all. Much less rock hard, in the gross office bathroom.\n\u201cOpen the goddamn door, Yoongi. We're talking about this.\u201d He sounds angry. Yoongi throbs in his pants.\nHe doesn\u2019t say a word but reluctantly swings the stall door open. Jin takes one look at him, his bite-swollen lips and his mussed hair and the swell of his pants, and he seems a little at loss for words, too.\nFinally, Yoongi breaks the silence, trying to offer an explanation for his appearance, and he sounds like he\u2019s about to cry. \u201cYou eat pizza like a goddamn porn star.\u201d\nJin looks utterly torn between wanting to laugh and something a lot darker. \u201cFuck,\u201d he sighs heavily, digging out his phone from his back pocket and bringing it to his ear. Yoongi has no clue what he's doing, until he hears who he\u2019s calling.\u00a0\u201cHoseok?\u201d he asks calmly, and Yoongi hears Hoseok respond affirmatively on the other end. \u201cWhere are the HR Relationship disclosure forms?\u201d\nYoongi's mouth goes very dry.\n\u201cOf course they are.\u201d\nAnother pause.\n\u201cOf course you did.\u201d What\u2019s scariest to Yoongi is that Jin\u2019s face does not change when he says, \u201cBecause I\u2019m going to fuck Yoongi on his desk.\u201d\nYoongi is floating outside of his body. He is not completely convinced that this is not just the most realistic sex dream he has ever had.\n\u201cI will absolutely never do that for you,\u201d Jin concludes calmly. \u201cOkay. Thanks. Bye.\u201d\nHe taps his screen and slips the phone into his back pocket, staring up at Yoongi expectantly.\n\u201cUm. What?\u201d Yoongi asks dumbly, shifting his weight nervously and feeling how hard his dick still is.\n\u201cHoseok has the forms already filled out for us in my desk. They\u2019ve been there for months. All we have to do is fill out our part, sign, and date.\u201d\n\u201cAnd?\u201d\n\u201cHe asked me to ask you to film it POV style. I told him no. Obviously.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026And, uh, that other part?\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Jin realizes, like he genuinely forgot. \u201cAnd I\u2019m gonna fuck you on your desk. If that\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 yeah?\u201d Yoongi says dreamily, like it's a question. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Jin asks, taking a step closer, then another, and Yoongi\u2019s dick throbs again in anticipation.\nHe swallows hard. \u201cPretty goddamn sure.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m still leaving,\u201d Jin clarifies, and the gap is closing between them.\n\u201cYou can stop saying that, you know. I told you. I\u2019m not asking you to fucking marry me.\u201d He ignores the part of him that screams in protest of the statement, and he focuses instead on the fact that he is about to get a very, very small part of something that he wants\u00a0very badly.\nJin smiles a little bitterly at that, and Yoongi thinks that he still sees a spark of anger in his gaze. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I hear you loud and clear.\u201d\n\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Yoongi prompts him uncertainly as he cranes his head up to look at Jin.\n\u201cSo\u2026I guess there\u2019s just one thing left to do,\u201d Jin says, and now he\u2019s close enough that he can reach out and hook a long finger in the waistband of Yoongi\u2019s pants.\n\u201cY-yeah?\u201d Yoongi stutters unconsciously leaning forward into Jin\u2019s magnetic pull.\n\u201cForm time!\u201d Jin releases his waistband with a loud painful snap, before grinning mischievously and playfully patting Yoongi\u2019s aching cock. \u201cSee you in the cube.\u201d\nYoongi feels annoyance lick hot in his stomach, but not nearly as hot as his arousal. \u201cDude are you fucking serious?\u201d he calls after Jin, who just continues out the bathroom door.\nHe is very fucking serious.\n\u201cFill it out,\u201d Jin orders him as he slides the form towards Yoongi on the desk and kicks his rolling chair out of the way.\n\u201cWhat? Why me?\u201d Yoongi demands crossly.\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m busy,\u201d Jin tells him, gently pushing Yoongi so that he is leaning over the desk. His hands glide lightly over the surface of Yoongi\u2019s clothed body, reaching around, hands coming briefly to a rest on his crotch and giving his rock-hard bulge a curious squeeze. \u201cWow.\u201d\n\u201cI think you underestimate how attracted I am to you,\u201d Yoongi gasps as he tries not to press his hips\u00a0forward into Jin\u2019s grasp.\n\u201cTake off your shoes.\u201d\nYoongi kicks them off distractedly, frantically searching his cluttered desktop for a pen. He swears that there are usually nothing\u00a0but\u00a0pens on his desktop every day, so many goddamn pens, and yet the\u00a0one\u00a0time he needs one\u2026\nBy the time he finds a pen, sticking out of a long-dead plant, his pants are around his ankles, his bare ass exposed to the cold office air as he leans over his desk.\nJin groans quietly, hands coming to rest on Yoongi\u2019s ass, massaging it gently, and yep that\u2019s pretty similar to his pizza groan.\n\u201cStep out,\u201d Jin tells him, yanking his pants off of his feet when Yoongi obliges. Then he peeks around Yoongi\u2019s shoulder to see what progress he\u2019s made. He clicks his tongue in annoyance. \u201cHurry up, Yoongi. You stop, I stop.\u201d\n\u201cYou stop what?\u201d Yoongi fires back, weirdly okay with being sprawled out, buck-ass naked, leaning over his desk in the middle of the office. \u201cYou\u2019re not even doing any- JESUS.\u201d\nIt takes a second for Yoongi to register the hot wetness on his hole and another second for him to realize exactly what is happening, but when he finally does, his pen goes clattering loudly to his desk. \u201cOh,\u201d he moans, voice embarrassingly high as he braces himself against the desk, form all but forgotten. \u201cOh fuck.\u201d\nThen the heat is gone, and Jin slaps his ass playfully. \u201cHey. What did I say? Form. We do this right.\u201d\n\u201cHow am I supposed to fill out this stupid form with your tongue in my ass?\u201d\n\u201cI guess you\u2019d better figure that out,\u201d Jin replies simply, gently fondling his balls, breath ghosting over his hole. Yoongi whimpers.\nIt takes every ounce of focus and determination he possesses to pick up the pen again. He falls forward on his elbows when Jin resumes his work, tongue insistently circling his entrance before flicking inside. \u201cOh sweet fucking hell.\u201d\n\nWhat is the nature of your relationship?\n\n\u201cUm, Jin?\u201d Yoongi swallows hard, grimacing as he tries to ignore the way that Jin\u2019s tongue is fucking into him. \u201cWhat are we?\u201d\nStillness. A complete absence of motion and heat.\n\u201cIs this really the time, Yoongi?\u201d comes Jin\u2019s voice from behind him, the grip on his hips a little tighter.\n\u201cIt\u2019s on the form,\u201d Yoongi says quickly, crumpling the paper with the force with which he grabs it to shove in Jin\u2019s face.\n\u201cOh. Right. Uh, just put\u2026 \u2018friends with benefits?\u2019\u201d\nSex Enemies,\u00a0Yoongi scrawls disdainfully, falling back down onto his elbows. \u00a0\n\u201cAre you done yet?\u201d Jin asks impatiently. \u201cGod your ass looks so good,\u201d he breathes, massaging Yoongi\u2019s flesh greedily.\nHe has to repress a shiver at the huskiness of Jin\u2019s voice. \u201cUh, yeah. All done. Just sign here.\u201d\nJin is suddenly beside him, tugging the pen from his hands and scribbling hastily on the paper. \u201cFucking finally.\u201d\nThe moment he lifts the pen from the paper, Jin slings the form off of the desk, grabbing Yoongi so abruptly that it startles him and shoving him so that he\u2019s sitting on the desk. \u201cDon\u2019t staple your ass\u00a0this time,\u201d he quips as he fumbles with the buttons of his own shirt. Yoongi takes the liberty of attacking his belt for him, whipping it out of the belt loops with such fervor that it smacks\u00a0hard against Jin\u2019s side. \u201cOuch!\u201d\n\u201cOops. Sorry,\u201d Yoongi apologizes in the most unapologetic tone he can muster.\n\u201cYou little\u2026\u201d Jin starts, weaving a hand through Yoongi\u2019s hair and gripping it hard, and goddamn that feels good. Yoongi swallows down his moan, watching Jin hungrily. His eyes are black, pupils huge, and the color high on his cheeks, his hair mussed perfectly and his lips swollen. He looks like some kind of deity of fury and sex. His expression is completely at odds with his seemingly playful demeanor, and Yoongi is thrown by it. He is thrown by Jin\u2019s hand in his hair, guiding his head in an excruciatingly slow, small semi-circle, like he\u2019s trying to see Yoongi\u2019s every angle. \u201cYoongi, I\u2026\u201d\nYoongi swallows hard, the action almost painful with his head pulled back. \u201cWhat?\u201d\nHe never finds out exactly what, because Jin answers with his mouth against Yoongi\u2019s. It\u2019s hot and dirty and demanding, and Yoongi doesn\u2019t mind one bit, licking eagerly into Jin\u2019s mouth as he reaches forward to shrug off his unbuttoned shirt. The nails of his thumbs rake over the silky smooth skin of Jin\u2019s arms as he peels away the fabric, and Jin shudders beneath his fingers. \u00a0\nJin shoves down his own pants and underwear as gracefully as he is able, kicking them aside carelessly as he grips Yoongi\u2019s hips and slides him further forward on the desk so that Yoongi\u2019s has to spread his legs to accommodate him. Their cocks only just brush, but Yoongi\u2019s exhale sounds more like a whine than an exhale regardless. Yoongi chances a glance down at Jin\u2019s pretty pink dick, licking his lips subconsciously. Jin doesn\u2019t miss the movement.\n\u201cYou really want to suck me off, don\u2019t you?\u201d Jin asks him, sounding extremely satisfied.\nYoongi\u2019s face flushes with heat. \u201cWhat?\u201d he panics, \u201cNo.\u201d\nJin smirks, reaching up to cup Yoongi\u2019s face. Yoongi thinks, for a moment, that it\u2019s going to be something tender, but then Jin runs his thumb along Yoongi\u2019s lips, pressing down lightly before slipping it inside his mouth. Yoongi\u2019s tongue curls up to meet him on instinct. \u201cAre you sure about that?\u201d He presses his thumb further inside, and Yoongi moans around it, flushing all the brighter. Jin withdraws his thumb, eyes sparkling darkly as he drags his spit-soaked digit down Yoongi\u2019s lip, then chin, gripping it tightly. \u201cDrop to your knees. Like last time.\u201d\nYoongi sets his jaw defiantly, but his dick gives a traitorous twitch. Jin\u2019s eyes light up in a dark kind of glee, his left eyebrow quirking victoriously. \u201cGo on.\u201d\nHe\u2019s torn, momentarily, between maintaining his pride and really wanting Jin\u2019s cock in his mouth. But before he knows it, his ass is sliding off the desk, knees hitting the rough, cheap carpet with a dull\u00a0thud.\nAnd there he is, face inches away from the most beautiful dick he\u2019s ever seen, and he can\u2019t pretend anymore that he doesn\u2019t want it. His nails dig into the sides of Jin\u2019s soft thighs as he pulls himself closer, dragging his knees harshly against the carpet. Jin\u2019s fingers card though his hair as Yoongi leans forward and licks a thick stripe up Jin\u2019s cock, only stopping to envelop the head in his mouth. It feels even better than it looks. It\u2019s firm and warm and so thick that it stretches the corners of his lips when he bobs his head down to take more in. Jin\u2019s precum is salty but pleasant on his tongue, and he turns his attention back to the head to try and get more of it. He laps at the tip, and Jin groans throatily, his grip tightening in Yoongi\u2019s hair.\nYoongi can\u2019t help it, spurred on by the noise, wanting so badly to hear it again. He overzealously tries to swallow down Jin\u2019s cock and ends up choking on it, his throat contracting and his mouth watering in protest. His eyes prickle slightly, and his scalp burns at Jin\u2019s unrelenting grip.\n\u201cFuck, Yoongi,\u201d Jin breathes, his voice heavy. \u201cCome here.\u201d\nYoongi makes a noise of disagreement, trying to swallow him down again, but Jin pulls him off and tugs him back into a standing position, before spinning them around so that Yoongi\u2019s ass is on the desk once again.\n\u201cWhere do you think they keep the lube around here?\u201d Jin asks, eyes darting down to Yoongi\u2019s crotch.\n\u201cI think the better question is, \u2018where don\u2019t they keep the lube?\u2019\u201d Yoongi replies dryly, his voice rough now. \u201cCheck in my drawer.\u201d\nWith one hand remaining on Yoongi\u2019s thigh, Jin reaches over and slings open Yoongi\u2019s desk drawer, fumbling around for only a second before his hand emerges triumphant. \u201cSeriously?\u201d\nIt\u2019s a bright blue bottle of lube, the good stuff, not the industrial sized jars their company sells, and there\u2019s a small pink post-it attached.\n\n\u2018Tell Jin hi ;)\u2019\n\n\u201cYour friends are disturbingly involved in your sex life,\u201d Jin informs him, tearing off the post-it and uncapping the bottle.\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling me,\u201d Yoongi agrees, watching in anticipation as Jin squirts a small amount of the lube into his hands. He then yanks Yoongi the last few inches forward so that their cocks are finally touching and lines them up, wrapping his now-glistening hand around both of them, grip firm as he slides it upwards, coating their lengths. Yoongi\u2019s mouth falls open, cock jerking forward into Jin\u2019s grip as his fingers caress both heads. He strokes them like that a few times, and Yoongi can\u2019t help but shut his eyes, his head thunking back against the padded wall.\n\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d Jin asks, his hand running down the length of Yoongi\u2019s dick, down past his balls, teasing at the skin beneath them. Yoongi tries not to roll forward into the touch.\n\u201cI thought you were going to fuck me on my desk,\u201d he says through teeth gritted with effort.\n\u201cIs that what you want?\u201d His slick finger teases at the edge of Yoongi\u2019s hole.\n\u201cGod yes.\u201d\nJin\u2019s eyes widen just the tiniest bit, then without another word, he slowly eases that finger inside of Yoongi, just a fraction of the way. Then he withdraws it, repeating the motion at a delicioulsy slow pace. It\u2019s been a while since Yoongi\u2019s had anything up his ass, so he\u2019s torn between being thankful for Jin\u2019s careful touch and being very, very ready to be face down on his desk as Jin fucks him to hell and back. Jin distracts him from his inner struggle with gently nips to his neck, dragging his tongue over each bite as if to soothe the sting. Yoongi squirms and lets out a soft, gruff sound of pleasure. He shuts his eyes and leans back against the wall, trying to ignore the very conspicuous and very intent way that Jin is gazing down at him.\u00a0\n\u201cStop\u2026 staring\u2026\u201d Yoongi mumbles before exhaling a whine.\nJin licks his lips hungrily, reaching down to drag his finger across Yoongi\u2019s slightly slack lips. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can.\u201d Yoongi flushes with incredible heat, rolling his hips down on Jin\u2019s other hand.\nAnd yet, even in the midst of all of this, in the midst of\u00a0Jin,\u00a0Yoongi can\u2019t silence the obnoxious, over-analytical part of his brain that needs to know what\u2019s happening. Why it\u2019s happening. What\u2019s going to happen after this. He doesn\u2019t even know what\u00a0this\u00a0is. He can\u2019t pin it down, can\u2019t pin Jin down. Jin, who craves roots but won\u2019t stop moving long enough to let them grow. Jin who pushes him away, tells him he\u2019s leaving even as he pulls him closer. Jin, who is staring at him with the strangest mix of anger and adoration. There is a molten intensity to his gaze. It\u2019s liquid stone. It\u2019s scalding and hard and yet undeniably soft.\nYoongi reaches out, needing to touch. He runs his shaking hands down the silky flushed skin of Jin\u2019s chest, down the soft skin of his flat stomach. He wants to feel, kiss, love, remember every part of Jin. He wants to commit it all to memory while he has the chance, and he knows he doesn't have long.\u00a0\nYoongi winces then, at two fingers.\n\u201cShit. Sorry,\u201d Jin mumbles, flinching away slightly, but Yoongi grabs his hand to hold it in place.\n\u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d he insists. \u201cI\u2019m fine. It feels good, too. It\u2019s just been a while. Please. Don\u2019t fucking stop.\u201d\nJin nods faintly, concern still evident on his face. But he obviously still feels guilty, feels the need to distract from the discomfort, because he pulls tugs Yoongi towards him to press wet, open-mouthed kisses to his neck, working his way down to his chest, where he grazes his teeth lightly over a nipple. Yoongi gasps, partly in surprise and pleasure, and partly because Jin is continuing lower, down his abdomen, nipping at the sensitive skin above his hipbone, and down even further still.\nIt\u2019s when Jin\u2019s nose grazes his inner thigh that Yoongi can\u2019t help but thrust forward towards his face.\n\u201cBe patient,\u201d Jin chastises him, grasping his hips tightly to hold him down.\nYoongi groans in frustration. \u201cI have been thinking about your mouth on my dick since the day we met. Now it\u2019s finally happening, and you\u2019re telling me to be fucking patient?\u201d\nJin smirks then, glancing up at Yoongi through his eyelashes. Without removing the hand currently inside Yoongi, Jin reaches over and pulls the rolling chair towards him so that he is no longer hunched. And when he sits, his face is exactly level with Yoongi\u2019s crotch.\nYoongi has seen Jin put a lot of things in his mouth. Yoongi has even gotten hard watching Jin put things in his mouth. (\u201cYou\u2019re eating that banana like you\u2019re getting paid to do it,\u201d Taehyung had informed Jin casually one day at lunch before elbowing Yoongi conspicuously underneath the table.)\nBut nothing could ever have prepared him for the actual sight of Jin\u2019s thick, spit-slicked lips stretched around his cock. It takes every ounce of self-control that Yoongi possesses not to come right then and there, especially as Jin\u2019s fingers find a new angle that rubs him just the right way. Yoongi hears an embarrassing whine coming from somewhere, then he chokes on the sound when he realizes it\u2019s him.\nJin is at once gentle and ruthless, his fingers fucking faster into Yoongi now that the slide is easier. But his mouth is warm and soft and wet, and nothing has ever felt better than this. Yoongi is sure of it.\nJin bobs his head low, taking in as much of Yoongi as he can, the motion of his fingers making Yoongi squirm in desperation. Whether he's squirming away or desperately closer, he has no clue. All he knows is that Jin can fit\u00a0a lot\u00a0into his mouth. He takes Yoongi in so deep that his nose brushes the skin between Yoongi's hips, and when he moans around\u00a0Yoongi's cock, Yoongi almost loses it,\u00a0because that's Jin's infamous\u00a0red velvet cake\u00a0moan. He is so utterly distracted that it takes him a second to realize that there's a third finger inside of him.\u00a0\n\"You can't keep... I'm gonna...\" Yoongi murmurs, feeling a bead of sweat drip down his temple.\u00a0\n\"No you're not,\" Jin mutters after he has pulled away from Yoongi's dick. \"I'm not done with you yet.\"\nJin withdraws his fingers slowly, and Yoongi cringes as he is left empty, clenching around nothing. He hears the plastic rumpling of a condom wrapper, and he shifts anxiously in anticipation.\nPart of Yoongi wishes Jin would flip him around for this. Bend him over the desk, shove his face away, and fuck him until he screams. This is too intimate, the way Jin's soft hands grasp at Yoongi's hips to pull him closer. The way Jin so carefully lines up the head of his cock with Yoongi's entrance. The way his eyes flutter shut and his beautiful swollen lips part gently as he slowly pushes inside. The hand that comes up to cup Yoongi's cheek as Jin pauses to gauge his reaction. Yoongi swallows it down, shuts it away to deal with later.\nThey sit there like that, for a moment, as Yoongi adjusts. He can see Jin's chest heaving, can feel the warm puffs of breath on his face, can see the glistening of his brow. Those black eyes are boring into his, like neither of them will dare to look away. Yoongi is burning up in his own skin. Too much Jin, in front of him, around him, inside of him.\u00a0\nThe tentative roll of Jin's hips forward has him groaning. The stretch is a little painful, but the idea of this, of Jin fucking him, is more than enough to make up for it. Part of him likes the burn. It makes it real. Jin is really here, fucking him,\u00a0looking at him, only him, and Yoongi is content with that.\u00a0\nJin's nails dig into his hips as he presses his forehead against Yoongi's their noses touching, lips hovering inches apart as Jin withdraws slightly and then thrusts forward, deeper this time. It's only a few more rolls of his hips\u00a0before Yoongi really adjusts, before he can really get lost in it. He can feel Jin staring down at him, so he shuts his eyes, turns his head away. Then there is a hand on his chin, guiding his face back up, and when his eyes flutter open, Jin is there, a strange, pleading look in his eyes. And Yoongi can't deprive Jin of something he wants, so he obliges. He stares right back as his ass shifts against the desk with the force of Jin's thrusts. He reaches down to brace himself against the slick, hard desk, all the while meeting Jin's intense gaze. The air between them sparks and crackles, and Yoongi feels like one second more of this and he will combust. Jin's breath is coming in ragged waves and throaty sounds as his pace quickens, as his fingers tighten around Yoongi's hips so hard that\u00a0his skin will\u00a0probably bruise.\n\"Jin.\" He doesn't even realize he's said it until he registers the change in Jin's eyes, the look of quiet surprise. It spurs him on as he fucks himself down on Jin's cock. Jin's eyes are wide, his hips slowing for a moment as Yoongi drags his hands in a light ghosting touch over Jin\u2019s back, his ass. Closer, always closer. \"Please,\" Yoongi repeats, and he doesn't know exactly what he's asking for. He just wants as much of Jin as he is allowed to have. Jin chews hard on his own lip as his eyes dart across the planes\u00a0of Yoongi's face.\u00a0\nThere is an unpleasant void as Jin withdraws, hands rough on Yoongi's skin as they flip him around, push his body down over the desk, and jerk his hips backwards so that he can push inside of him again. And yes, this is how it should have been from the beginning. Impersonal, unrelenting. Jin's grip is in his hair is firm, pulling his head backwards so that Jin can attack his exposed neck with lips and tongue and teeth. Yoongi is so close, has been close for so long, and the illicitness of the rough treatment has him teetering so close to the edge that he is about to go tumbling over when there is a sudden loud\u00a0bang\u00a0as the wood of the office door hits the wall.\u00a0\nJin's hand claps over Yoongi's mouth as they hear the sound of rolling wheels against the cheap carpet. \"Shhh,\" Jin urges, ears perking up to the sound.\u00a0\n\"Janitor?\" Yoongi mouths, dragged rather unwillingly back to reality as he hears the whistle of a cheerful tune accompany the clattering of a cart and the rolling of wheels.\u00a0\nJin nods solemnly, gaze flicking back to Yoongi. \"Should... should we stop?\"\nYoongi hesitates, turning his head back towards Jin, knowing that the answer is 'yes,' but when he shifts and feels Jin's dick, still hot and throbbing inside of him, he can't force himself to utter the word. Jin's eyebrow twitches upwards, but his hands tighten around Yoongi's waist, pulling him back on further on his cock. A soft moan spills from Yoongi's lips, and there's Jin's hand hushing him again.\n\"We should stop, right?\" Jin repeats, this time subtly rolling his hips forward into Yoongi, not sounding one bit like he actually wants to stop. His hand falls away to allow Yoongi to whisper his answer.\n\"Um,\" Yoongi ponders quietly as his head slumps forward, forehead resting against the desk. \"That is certainly... an argument that one could make.\"\nJin's fingers thread, snakelike, through his hair, gripping hard, and Yoongi's mouth pops open, a low growl emitting from his throat. \"You don't want to stop, do you?\"\u00a0Yoongi shakes his head violently, and Jin's hand closes even more firmly around the strands of his hair. \"Good. Keep quiet.\"\nThat is easier said than done, as Jin rocks his hips forward, gasping quietly into Yoongi's ear. Yoongi's nails drag across his desk in an effort to maintain his silence, but when Jin gives a particularly well-angled thrust, he can't stop the strangled sound that he makes in his throat. At once, Jin's hand is back to silence him,\u00a0sprawled across Yoongi's mouth and nose and making it harder to breathe.\u00a0He could turn his head, easily break free if he wanted to, but he doesn't.\u00a0\nHe's close. He's\u00a0been\u00a0close. But he's waiting for Jin. He knows Jin is close, too, the way his body tenses, the way his breath hitches in his throat, the way his hand tightens on Yoongi's mouth. Yoongi\u2019s ability to remain upright is fading fast, and he can no longer brace himself as steadily against Jin\u2019s thrusts. Jin must sense this, because in a moment, his hand is there, at the place where Yoongi's shoulder meets his neck,\u00a0to prevent him from being pushed forward into the wall each time Jin fucks into him. It\u2019s probably unconscious, Yoongi thinks, the way Jin\u2019s fingers curl around the left side of his neck, the way his nails dig into Yoongi\u2019s skin, the way he is pressing down with just enough pressure to impede the flow of blood and air to the rest of his body. It\u2019s probably unconscious, but that doesn\u2019t mean that Yoongi isn\u2019t enjoying it, the way his world is blurring slightly around the edges, the way everything feels very surreal and warm and tingly. His hand finds his own cock, and just a couple of distracted strokes is all it takes.\nIt's a white flash of heat that he can simultaneously see and feel and hear. It floods the tips of his toes and fingers, tingling with impossible warmth, and Yoongi's throat is burning in the most delicious\u00a0way, and he is spiraling into nothingness. Jin stiffens behind him, nails digging into the soft skin of Yoongi's cheek as he comes silently, hips stuttering and fucking forward with one long, deep thrust. Yoongi is floating and burning and flying, the ugly speckled gray desk swimming in front of him as Jin's hand falls away from his mouth. Yoongi gasps for air, limbs still tingling as he coughs and falls forward limply, legs giving out. Jin catches him under the armpits and hauls him back up, slumping him in the office chair.\u00a0\n\"Hey, shit, you okay?\" Jin questions him, slapping his face lightly as Yoongi's head lolls back.\u00a0\u201cWhat the fuck, Yoongi?\u201d\n\"\u2019M fine,\" Yoongi croaks out, ears ringing as his head swims in a post-orgasm haze. \"So fine.\"\nJin sighs in exasperation. \"Well, I\u2019m glad to hear that, because you probably have about a minute to put your pants back on before we have company.\"\nWhen Yoongi makes no movement towards his pants, Jin groans curses, stooping to fetch them. He shoves Yoongi's legs mercilessly into the pant legs and tugs on his shirt, completely mismatching the buttons, before he attends to his own nakedness.\u00a0\n\"Oh, hello,\" Jin greets the janitor over his shoulder a minute later, when the rolling of wheels ceases outside Yoongi's cubicle. \"Just, uh, just working late. You can skip this area for now.\"\nYoongi is still too fucked-out to do anything other than remain still in his chair, slumped over his desk, shirt still haphazardly buttoned, hair still an utter nest. He hears the janitor grunt and grumble as the clacking of wheels retreats further and further from their corner.\u00a0\n\"That was ridiculously\u00a0close,\" Jin mutters, jogging over to his own cubicle for several moments before re-appearing back in front of Yoongi. Yoongi feels something cool and wet on his hand, and he looks down to see Jin kneeling as he carefully wipes down Yoongi\u2019s cum-covered skin with a wetwipe. He's doing it with a tenderness that makes Yoongi's insides churn, and when he's\u00a0done, he moves to fix the buttons on Yoongi\u2019s shirt. \u201cGod, you\u2019re a mess. Are you\u2026 um. Are you sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d\n\u201cNever better,\u201d Yoongi grumbles, pushing Jin\u2019s hands away and swiveling his chair so that he doesn\u2019t have to look at him.\n\u201cGood,\u201d Jin replies, and it sounds like he has pushed himself to his feet. There are a few moments of silence, then, \u201cOh, did you finish that 3-year projection graph?\"\nAnd that's it, Yoongi supposes. Back to work.\n\"Yeah,\" Yoongi manages, leaning forward to grab a paper from his desk and wincing as his oversensitive dick brushes against the rough fabric of his pants.\u00a0\n\"Great. Thanks,\" Jin replies, patting him on the shoulder before he plucks the paper from Yoongi's hands.\u00a0\nThey finish around two. The janitor is long gone, having skillfully avoided their little corner, like he knew. He probably did, Yoongi realizes as he stands and stretches, preparing to leave. His underwear is crumpled near the wall at the entrance of his cube.\n\"I have to be on the road in three hours,\" Jin laments with a groan, shrugging on his jacket as Yoongi gathers his things.\u00a0\nYoongi just raises his eyebrows in what he hopes is a sympathetic response, because he really can't muster words right now. A quiet, inconspicuous escape may be his best option, he decides, head tucked as he goes to exit his cube. But of course Jin is there, blocking his path.\u00a0\n\"Uh, hey,\" Jin starts, and Yoongi can't focus on anything except the gap in his shirt where his buttons are still improperly fastened. \"I think we made a good team. You know, the last few months.\" Yoongi nods neutrally, just wanting to leave before he starts getting too emotional. He already feels it, bubbling up like bile in his throat.\u00a0\"I'll... I'll text you? To let you know how it goes?\" Jin asks uncertainly, and Yoongi is staring very hard at the wall over his shoulder. He nods again, shortly. \"See you at the Jammies, then.\"\nYoongi is dying to look at his face, to try and get a better read on the situation, but he can't tear his eyes away from the safety of the gray wall. Jin lingers for just a moment more, then he is gone, and Yoongi's legs finally give way as he stumbles back into his chair.\nNot a big deal.\u00a0His own words.\nHe looks down at his phone. Three missed calls and 47 messages from Hoseok, most of them lewd improvised emojis. One weirdly chill message from Taehyung asking Yoongi if he wants him to bring dessert, followed by one not chill at all message making a lewd allusion to Jin\u2019s dick and dessert, followed by one chill-again message in which Taehyung apologizes for letting Hoseok get a hold of his phone.\nHe sits there for another 15 minutes before he can muster the willpower to move, to push himself to his shaky legs, ass aching, and walk out the door.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe office is as loud and chaotic as usual, but the empty space in the cube behind Yoongi makes the place feel weirdly deserted.\u00a0\nHis ass hasn't been in his chair for 10 seconds before there is a pair of clasping hands on his shoulders, whirling his seat around. Yoongi reels back as Hoseok's face hovers inches from his.\u00a0\n\"What. Happened,\" Hoseok demands, a scary glint of intense interest eyes. \"You never texted me back, you dick! Details of every kind. Sight, touch, sound, smell, come on. Let's go.\"\nYoongi groans lightly. \"Nothing happened.\"\nHoseok's expression turns the strangest mix of sympathetic and sharp. \"Buddy, there's a used condom in your office trash can, and this cube smells like a teenage boy's unwashed sheets.\"\n\"Fuck.\"\n\"Come on. Give me the full experience. Start from the beginning, and don't leave out a single detail.\"\n\"Please fuck off,\" Yoongi grumbles, trying to turn back to his work.\u00a0\n\"You owe me this! I can't believe you refused to take video.\u00a0After everything I have done for you.\"\u00a0Yoongi's laser death glare is enough to have Hoseok sliding off of his desk, backing away slowly with his hands in the air. \"Fine, bitch. I'll just check the security cam footage.\"\nYoongi's forehead hits his desk with a gently\u00a0thunk.\u00a0\nJin's meeting with the CFO is late, at four, and Yoongi is painfully aware of the passage of time as the day drags on, the Friday that never ends.\u00a0\nHe gets the text at 5:05. His pocket vibrates while he is sitting at the bus stop with Taehyung and Jimin, waiting. The message is short and sweet, and it makes his stomach twist\u00a0in the most incredible fashion when he sees who it's from.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSeokjin From Corporate: Approved. We did it. :)\n\u00a0\nYoongi can't help his smile, the grip on his phone tightening as he exhales slowly.\u00a0\nHe types twenty different responses and deletes\u00a0them all. Nothing seems like the right balance of just enough and not too much. After almost fifteen minutes of deliberation, he settles on a \"thumbs-up\" emoji.\u00a0\nOn the bus, on the way home, Taehyung chuckles beside him.\u00a0\n\"What?\" he questions insistently, elbowing his friend in the ribs.\u00a0\n\"Nothing. Just Jin. Snapchat\"\n\"What... What's he doing?\" Yoongi questions as casually as he is able.\u00a0\n\"He's getting drunk off his ass to celebrate. With a bunch of people from Corporate. I guess he has friends, after all.\u201d\n\"Oh,\" Yoongi remarks, suppressing his jealous pangs as he imagines Jin enjoying cocktails with a crowd of fashionable, professional city folks. \"Good. Great.\"\nHe surreptitiously checks his phone, unsurprised but still kind of bitter when he sees no new notifications. Taehyung's phone buzzes happily, and Yoongi stands up abruptly, getting off the bus one stop too early.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAfter the second Jammies, at the insistence of Jimin and Taehyung, Yoongi had given in and purchased a tuxedo, figuring that biting the bullet and buying one would make more sense than paying to rent one annually. And this year, he has almost gotten over the utter mortification of walking into a shitty Karaoke bar dressed in a full tuxedo. It probably doesn\u2019t hurt that he is completely absorbed in\u00a0hypothetical after hypothetical about what's going to happen when he sees Jin again.\u00a0\nHe stands on the street outside the bar in the fading sunlight, ignoring the inquisitive stares of passers-by, scuffing his shiny shoe against the concrete as he contemplates going inside.\u00a0\nSomebody elbows him harshly in the ribs, and he startles, but it's just Hoseok. \"Hey.\"\n\"Don't scare me like that, dude,\" Yoongi scolds him, hand fluttering to his heart.\u00a0\n\"Why are you standing out here when waiting inside for you are both alcohol and that supremely hot piece of ass you somehow managed to trick into sleeping with you?\"\nYoongi is so anxious that he doesn't even glare. \"I was just about to go in,\" he claims falsely, skeptically eyeing the door and startling once more when it swings open and a middle-aged woman and her son step out.\u00a0\n\"Sure you were,\" Hoseok appeases him, patting his arm sympathetically.\u00a0\n\"I just...\" Yoongi starts quietly, \"I just don't know how to act. Like, we had weirdly intense sex. In our place of work. And not a minute after we were done, he was asking me for the goddamn projections, like nothing even happened. I\u2019m not kidding, Hoseok, it was weird fast,\" Yoongi's eyes lose focus, the world going a little blurry. \"What if it didn't actually happen? What if it was all some crazy dream fueled by too much pizza and sleep deprivation?\"\n\"It was real, buddy. Believe me.\" And\u00a0Yoongi does muster a suspicious glare for that one.\n\"Please tell me you did not actually watch the security camera footage,\" he pleads.\n\"Oh I definitely did,\" Hoseok promises. \"But you couldn't see shit in your actual cube. Only the walls shaking slightly as you presumably got your ass pounded, then one very disturbed janitor fleeing the scene. But it most certainly happened.\"\nYoongi groans lightly, turning away and vaguely considering taking off at a sprint.\u00a0\n\"Hey, hey, it's okay,\" Hoseok reassures him, grabbing lightly onto Yoongi's sleeve to keep him from booking it. \"Look, I'll be right there beside you. I've got your back.\"\n\"I am not remotely comforted by that.\"\nThey have rented one of the larger rooms in the place, and Jimin and Taehyung have decked it out with decorations from what looks like the clearance bin at a party store.\nUpon entry, Yoongi does a quick scan, counts the bodies in the room, and yep, there are five, in addition to Hoseok and him. All accounted for.\u00a0\nNamjoon and Jungkook are already engaged in a spirited rap duet, and Jin's head is thrown back in laughter at something that Jimin just said. When the door shuts behind them, Jin's head jerks in their direction, and he stiffens visibly. Yoongi takes a deep breath and steps forward. Jimin and Taehyung somehow melt into the shadows, and suddenly it's just him and Jin.\u00a0\n\"Hey!\" Jin says with an obviously forced enthusiasm. \"So... Congratulations?\" He extends his hand, and Yoongi's heart plummets even as he reaches forward to take it. Back to Business.\u00a0\n\"Uh, yeah,\" Yoongi agrees with a fake-ass smile. \"Great work. Thanks for all your help.\"\n\"Just doing my job,\" Jin replies stiffly, and that kind of stings.\u00a0\n\"Right.\"\n\"Okay everybody sit the fuck down and pay attention to me,\" Hoseok's voice rings out, too loud, over the totally unnecessary microphone. Yoongi averts his eyes from Jin's gaze and makes his way over to the bench. Jin takes a seat on the far side.\u00a0\u201cWelcome to the annual year-end Jammies, the most anticipated event of the year. I am your host, the delightful, delectable Jung H-, \u201d\n\u201cGet on with it,\u201d Jimin groans, leaning his head on Taehyung\u2019s shoulder.\n\u201cWow Jimin, kindly dig your thong out of your ass and get into the holiday spirit, would you?\u201d\n\u201cFuck off, Hoseok, I like my thong right where it is,\u201d Jimin bites back, rising halfway from his seat as Taehyung restrains him.\n\u201cOkay pissy pants,\u201d Hoseok replies with his eyebrows raised, \u201cSimmer down. We\u2019re here to celebrate the year\u2019s end and the departure of our good buddy, Jin.\u201d\nJimin just pouts harder, sinking deeper into his seat. \u201cWhy should we celebrate either of those things? I love Jin, and 2016 was fucking amazing. I had my first threesome, and my pit hair really filled in. 2017 is going to be shit in comparison.\u201d\n\u201cJust-\u201d Hoseok interrupts, massaging his forehead with his fingers, \u201c-chill. Would you? Just fucking chill. Let me do this. This is my time.\u201d\n\u201cI told you we shouldn\u2019t have let him host it,\u201d Taehyung complains to Namjoon. \u201cJimin and I were way better. He has the sex appeal of a beached dolphin.\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cAnyway, I\u2019m speaking,\u201d Hoseok says loudly, ignoring Jimin and Taehyung\u2019s fierce whispering. \u201cNow before we get started with the presentation of awards, I have created a compilation video of this year\u2019s very best office hi-jinx. A year-end review of our very best moments.\u201d\n\u201cHoseok, this feels like not a good thing to do. This feels like a getting fired thing to do,\u201d Namjoon warns him solemnly.\n\u201cNams. Chill, buddy. Would I, the HR guy, put all of our careers at risk by parading our blatant flouting of company policy and providing substantiating video evidence for several misdemeanors, one with trial pending?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cFor the security of all of your jobs, I was did not officially attend this event, and I never saw this video,\u201d Jin remarks decisively when the lights flicker back on and the screen goes black.\n\u201cHow did you even get that footage? Who has been filming us?\u201d Namjoon asks in dismay, then he stops himself. \u201cNever mind. I don\u2019t want to know.\u201d\n\u201cWe should sell this to MTV. We would make a great show,\u201d Taehyung ponders seriously. \u201cThey could call it The Office.\u201d\n\u201cI think that one\u2019s already a thing, buddy,\u201d Jungkook says, patting him on the back consolingly.\n\u201cAnd now back to me, everyone look at me,\u201d Hoseok screeches into the mic, which screeches right back. Yoongi covers his ears.\n\u201cHoseok, enjoy this,\u201d Namjoon warns him, jiggling his leg anxiously in his seat, \u201cBecause you are never hosting again.\u201d\n\u201cYou forget, Namjoon, this show dies with me. That sexy bastard over there cancelled it.\u201d He points accusingly at Jin, whose head jerks from side to side to see if everyone is looking at him. They are. \u201cAnyway, we will now start the presentation of the awards. When I call your name, please come up and accept your trophy. Unfortunately, as we only have the room until 11 and that video was slightly longer than I recalled, we will not have time for acceptance speeches or indignant denials this year. Accept your award and sit your ass down.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one who argued for twenty minutes last year how you weren\u2019t the \u2018Most likely to end up in the ER with something weird stuck up his ass.\u2019 And look how that turned out,\u201d Namjoon argues, folding his arms in front of him. \u201cTake me off your fucking emergency contacts, by the way. Never again.\u201d\n\u201cWell excuse me if I have been exploring my sexual boundaries. There is nothing wrong with a little creativ-\u201d\n\u201cBoo, time\u2019s ticking, asshole,\u201d Yoongi heckles him from the corner.\n\u201cFine,\u201d Hoseok huffs. \u201cThis first award is a new category this year, but one of my personal favorites. The award for \u2018Brightest future in Amateur Fetish Porn\u2019 goes to our own Kim Namjoon!\u201d\n\u201cFuck no,\u201d Taehyung and Namjoon say in unison.\n\u201cI was a shoo-in for that one!\u201d Taehyung demands, gripping his beer in outrage. \u201cThis is bullshit, Spaghetti-Os aren't even a real fucking fetish.\"\n\"Speak for yourself,\" Hoseok mumbles, flipping through the note cards in his hand.\n\u201cI refuse to accept this award,\u201d Namjoon says, settling back in his chair.\n\u201cI refuse to not accept this award,\u201d Taehyung demands, beating his fist on the shaky table.\n\u201cWell, whether you accept it or not, Namjoon, you're the winner,\" Hoseok tells him matter-of-factly. \"And if you change your mind and decide to embrace your destiny, I know a guy who would be very interested.\u201d\n\u201cGross.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, moving along,\u201d Hoseok continues. \u201cThis one is an old favorite. Most HR Violations in one year.\u201d He slides the envelope open with one finger, his face a mask of mock surprise when he sees the name on the card. \u201cNow this is a real shocker, the award goes to-\u201d\n\u201cYou,\u201d come six unamused voices in unison.\n\u201cWow you guys really know how to suck the fun out of a thing,\u201d Hoseok pouts, tossing the envelope over his shoulder.\nAnd he\u2019s right. There is the feeling of a weird dark cloud hanging above the whole event, and Yoongi doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s just him, or if the rest of the guys pick up on it, too. Maybe it\u2019s because it\u2019s the last Jammies, maybe it\u2019s because Jin is leaving, or maybe his own negative energy is just rubbing off on all of them. Hoseok seems to be trying to keep the whole thing moving, but even Jimin only puts up a mild fight when Jin takes the award for \u201cMost Likely To Make a Straight Man Realize He\u2019s Not That Straight.\u201d Hoseok\u2019s hand lingers on Jin\u2019s as he passes him the trophy.\nBeside him, Jungkook scoffs audibly. Yoongi whispers him a hushed, \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cIf you weren\u2019t totally into Jin, Hoseok actually would have tapped that,\u201d Jungkook hisses back at him.\n\u201cI\u2019m not\u2026\u00a0into\u00a0him,\u201d Yoongi whispers back, tucking his arms in front of him protectively.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Jungkook says by way of appeasement as Hoseok announces the next award, \u201cMost Likely To Leak His Own Sex Tape To The Entire Company.\u201d\n\u201cTaehyung, this award is for Jimin,\u201d Hoseok insists into the microphone, his voice echoing and distorted as Taehyung moves to accept the trophy.\n\u201cWe have asked you several times to refer to us as \u2018Vmin,\u2019\u201d Taehyung responds, trying to pry the award from Hoseok\u2019s hand. \u201cAnd I accept this award on his behalf.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s ten fucking feet away,\u201d Hoseok says incredulously.\n\u201cRespect my choices!\u201d Jimin shouts from the back of the room, his feet propped up on the table.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Jungkook murmurs softly in his direction while Hoseok and Taehyung struggle over the trophy. \u201cYou know he likes you, right?\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you even talking about?\u201d Yoongi mutters as Taehyung lets go of the trophy and Hoseok consequently hits himself in the eye with it.\n\u201cJin. He likes you,\u201d Jungkook confirms. \u201cI see things. I hear things.\u201d\nYoongi rolls his eyes, gaze darting nervously over to Jin, who is focused intently on the conflict before him. \u201cHe likes my ass.\u201d\n\u201cHe likes\u00a0you,\u201d Jungkook insists. \u201cYou are the two most oblivious fucking humans\u2026\u201d\n\u201cLook,\u201d Yoongi bites back quietly, \u201cWe are adults. Adults can separate the sexual and the emotional.\u201d\n\u201cBut only fucking dumbasses think that they have to,\u201d Jungkook trills, his voice almost obscured by Hoseok\u2019s scream as Taehyung wrestles him to the floor.\n\u201cOh shut up,\u201d Yoongi hisses, slumping deeper into his chair. \u201cWhat do you know? You\u2019re like two.\u201d\n\u201cI may be two, but at least I\u2019m not a fucking dumbass.\u201d\nYoongi jumps to his feet in righteous indignation, and everyone is too distracted by the continuing scuffle going on up front to notice him leaving the room. He paces angrily out front of the Karaoke Bar for a few minutes, before the door swings open, and suddenly Jungkook is beside him.\n\u201cWhat are you doing out here?\u201d he demands as Jungkook leans beside him against the brick of the building.\nJungkook shrugs, placing a cigarette between his lips. \u201cI\u2019m having a smoke. What are you doing?\u201d\nYoongi plucks the cigarette from Jungkook's mouth, ignoring his\u00a0protestations, and tosses it to the ground. \u201cSmoking is bad for you.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u00a0smoke.\u201d\n\u201cI do no such thing.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d Jungkook pouts, kicking the ruined cigarette out onto the road. \u201cFuck you, that was my last cigarette.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d Yoongi grumbles, wrapping his coat around him as the wind picks up.\n\u201cHey\u2026\u201d Jungkook starts, glancing to the left and right to make sure that no one else is listening. \u201cYou know that you\u2019re a pretty cool dude right?\u201d\nIt\u2019s the closest thing to praise from Jungkook that Yoongi has ever heard. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t make me say it again, asshole,\u201d Jungkook says in annoyance.\n\u201cOkay, what\u2019s your point?\u201d\n\u201cMy point is\u2026\u201d Jungkook struggles. \u201cJin\u2019s a pretty cool dude, too.\u201d\nYoongi chances a glance at Jungkook, whose hair has fallen in front of his eyes. \u201cWhat are you-\u201d\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d Jungkook bursts out suddenly, \u201cJust get married and have babies, I don\u2019t fucking know. Fuck off.\u201d\nWith that, he shoves himself away from the wall and wrenches the door open, disappearing inside. Yoongi is confused and stunned for a moment. He is also touched. It\u2019s very possibly the longest conversation with Jungkook he\u2019s ever had.\nHe meanders back inside after several moments, and he sees that Taehyung is now pouting in the corner.\n\u201cCome on guys, can we get a little pep in our step?\u201d Hoseok tries to enthuse them, as Yoongi settles back into his seat. But his audience is completely unresponsive. Jimin drains his drink, and Namjoon yawns widely.\nThe last straw seems to be when Yoongi, too, refuses to accept his trophy. It bears the title \u201cBest Ass-Related Office Incident of 2016.\u201d (\u201cOriginally it was for the staple thing, but you actually out-did yourself this week\u2026\u201d Hoseok tells him later.)\n\u201cMaybe we should just call this one, Hoseok,\u201d Namjoon says quietly, pushing away his half-full beer.\n\u201cI\u2026 But it\u2019s the last\u2026\u201d He sighs heavily, his face falling a little as he looks out into the unenthusiastic faces before him. \u201cOkay. Fine. There\u2019s just one more award, anyway.\u201d He picks up the last trophy and holds it so that he can read the title. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018Bro of the Year.\u2019 It\u2019s for our newest bro. Jin. Unanimous votes. Whatever.\u201d\nIf Yoongi wasn\u2019t sure whether atmosphere was down before, he certainly is now. He thinks he hears Jimin sniffle quietly. Jin rises quietly from his seat and takes the trophy from Hoseok with a gentle smile, patting his shoulder with his free hand.\n\u201cUh, thanks, guys,\u201d Jin says quietly, and Yoongi isn't sure if his voice is husky or if it's just his imagination. \u201cThis is really sweet. And really fucking lame. But mostly sweet. And thanks for making me an honorary member of the gang. It really\u2026 It means a lot. Uh. Yeah.\u201d\nWith a stiff nod and pursed lips, he retreats to his seat, and Hoseok grabs the microphone again, shrugging. \u201cWell, that\u2019s it, I guess?\u201d It\u2019s utterly anticlimactic. Everybody moves to start gathering their things and straightening up. \u201cJesus people, I\u2019ve seen more cheer in an airport security line.\u201d\nJin is among the first ones ready, trophies slipped into his shoulder bag, phone in his hand. \u201cI\u2019ve got an early flight,\u201d he says awkwardly. \u201cSo\u2026 It\u2019s been fun?\u201d\u00a0Jimin steps forward to hug Jin sweetly, but besides that, they are silent. \"See you around, I guess.\"\nYoongi searches for any sign of additional acknowledgement in his face as Jin's\u00a0eyes sweep over the group, any lingering glance. But there\u2019s nothing.\u00a0With a small wave, he turns to go, and Yoongi can\u2019t believe he\u2019s actually leaving. The door to the Karaoke bar swinging shut behind him, leaving nothing but a burst of cold wind from the outside.\n\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d Hoseok bursts out the second the door\u00a0clatters shut.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s\u00a0it?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Yoongi asks defensively, even though he knows exactly what.\n\u201cWow,\u201d Hoseok marvels, staring at Yoongi like he truly can\u2019t believe it. \u201cYou guys are the biggest fucking idiots.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what exactly did you expect to happen? At this very public company event?\u201d Yoongi pouts.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I guess I just hoped that one of you would realize that you\u2019re madly in love with each other.\u201d\nYoongi scoffs. \u201cAre you eight years old? Hoseok, we fucked. End of story. What would possibly make you think that he\u2019s in love with me?\u201d\n\u201cUm, I don\u2019t know, Yoongi. He bought you a dumb plant. He worked his ass off and called in like all of his favors to make your job easier,\u201d Hoseok counts off the reasons on his fingers, \u201cHe spent much of his birthday two feet from your dick instead of making a break for it. And he turned down one very eager blowjob because he knew he was leaving and didn\u2019t want either of you to get hurt. Not that that turned out, but, still\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThis is ridiculous, Tae,\u201d Jimin says loudly, pushing past Taehyung to address Yoongi. \u201cI\u2019m telling him.\u201d\nTaehyung grabs his arm and growls, \u201cJimin, do NOT-\u201d\n\u201cJin drunk texted Tae that he was in love with you last night,\u201d Jimin blurts out before Taehyung can stop him.\nThere are about three seconds of silence, then, \u201cWhat.\u201d Yoongi stares, frozen mid-snarl, refusing to believe.\n\u201cWait, seriously?\u201d Hoseok asks, peeking around Yoongi and looking floored.\n\u201cThanks a fucking lot,\u201d Taehyung spits at Jimin.\u00a0\n\u201cTae, did he really?\u201d Hoseok demands.\nTaehyung pouts. \u201cHe kind of got drunk after the meeting, and he told me.\u201d\nYoongi lunges, snarling, but Hoseok is too fast, catching his arm. \u201cWhy the hell\u00a0didn\u2019t you say something?\u201d Yoongi spits, struggling in Hoseok's grip.\nTaehyung looks genuinely surprised, spine going rigid, eyebrows disappearing into his fringe. \u201cOh, hell no. No. No, you don\u2019t get to give me shit for this. You\u2019re the one who explicitly told me no more meddling. You said don\u2019t help you ever, ever again. So fuck that.\u201d\n\u201cTaehyung, this is-\u201c He grips his hair and throws back his head, groaning loudly. \u201cTaehyung, this is- this is SO\u2026 that is- You-\u201c\n\u201cYou said do not help you, even if you\u2019re bleeding in a ditch!\u201d\n\u201cThis is clearly not what I meant!\u201d\n\u201cHow else what I supposed to interpret that? You said never again!\u201d\n\u201cKids, now is clearly not the time to be arguing semantics,\u201d Hoseok interrupts them, pushing Yoongi towards the door. \u201cYoongi, go.\u201d\n\u201cGo where?\u201d Yoongi asks, though he knows.\n\u201cGo after him!\u201d\n\u201cN.. No way!\u201d\n\u201cYoongi,\u201d Hoseok sighs, giving him that knowing look. \u201cJust go.\u201d\n\u201cFfff\u2026uck.\u201d\nThen he's charging towards the door as the cheers of his friends resonate behind him.\nOutside, the streets are dark and empty, and Yoongi's first thought is that he waited too long. But there's a flicker of movement, and Yoongi spots a pair of broad shoulders in an expensive coat hunched under the bus stop shelter. The figure checks his watch, before straightening back up and pulling his coat tighter around him.\n\u201cHey!\u201d Yoongi shouts, too loud in the quiet streets. Jin turns then, and thank god it actually is Jin, because Yoongi is already jogging towards him determinedly. He\u2019s out of breath by the time he reaches him, a combination of being extremely out of shape and also about to barf from nerves.\n\u201cYoongi,\u201d Jin asks, concerned, turning to face him as he approaches. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nYoongi reaches him finally, shoes slapping hard against the pavement as he comes to an abrupt stop.\n\u201cUh,\u201d he wheezes, \u201cYou. I. You\u2026. I need to sit down. Wow, I\u2019m gonna barf for so many different reasons.\u201d\nJin guides him to the bench, looking endearingly concerned, and Yoongi's stomach wriggles uncomfortably inside if him. \u201cHey, chill. You\u2019re fine. What\u2019s up?\u201d\nYoongi swallows hard, the mucus sticking in his throat as he looks at Jin. \u201cI think you should stay.\u201d\nJin stiffens where he stands, taking an automatic half step back, and that is not a good sign. \u201cWhat?\u201d\nYoongi cringes both internally and externally, suddenly less brave. \u201cI don\u2019t think you should go. I think you should stay here.\u201d\nJin looks pityingly at him, and Yoongi\u2019s heart clenches painfully. \u201cYoongi, my apartment is rented. My ticket is booked. I\u2019m going.\u201d\n\u201cYeah well, there\u2019s always going to be another apartment, another ticket, another city. It\u2019s not going to stop unless you stop it. So stop it. And stay,\u201d he hesitates before he adds, \u201cWith me.\u201d\nJin lets the statement hang unresolved in the air for a few moments before he sighs. His fingers delicately find his temples and massage them gently. \u201cLook, Yoongi. I thought I was clear going into this. I was always going to leave. I thought you knew that.\u201d\n\u201cI did know that. I mean, I do know that,\u201d Yoongi stutters, heat flooding his face and ears. \u201cBut\u2026 I like you. So I\u2019m trying. I\u2019m making an absolute ass of myself trying. One of us has to.\u201d\nJin sighs deeply, shifting his bag in his shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you think-\u201c\n\u201cTaehyung told me.\u201d\nJin's mouth snaps shut with an abrupt clicking noise, and his eyes are suddenly hard, his lovely mouth pulled into a strangely harsh line.\n\u201cWhat you said last night,\u201d Yoongi continues, still trying to catch his breath, knowing that he sounds a little desperate now. \u201cHe told me.\u201d\nJin\u2019s blink seems like more of a twitch, and his mouth is tight as he takes a deep breath through his nose, nostrils flaring slightly.\n\u201cI\u2019m leaving, Yoongi,\u201d he says finally, his voice disturbingly flat. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you want me to say.\u201d\nYoongi deflates slowly, his stomach sinking through the floor as he chews so hard on the inside of his cheek that his tongue tastes bitter and metallic. His heart is galloping away at breakneck speed, adrenaline and anger surging in his blood. \u201cNothing, I guess.\u201d His eyes are prickling in warning, and he bows his head to ensure that Jin can\u2019t see. \u201cBut hey, you were right.\u201d\n\u201cAbout what?\u201d Jin asks quietly, like he already knows. Yoongi swipes covertly at his eyes before pushing himself to his feet and staring into Jin's reluctant gaze.\n\u201cYou are a fucking coward.\u201d\nWith the nastiest glare he can manage, Yoongi pushes past him, stuffing his hands into his pockets and hunching his shoulders against the wind. He makes it about ten feet before his neutral expression crumbles\u00a0pathetically, and Yoongi has no choice but to walk back into the karaoke bar, because he knows Jin is still watching his retreating figure.\nHoseok understands the situation first, of course, heads off the premature chorus of \u2018how did it go?\u2019s and \u2018what did he say?'s with a stern shush, rushing forward to divert a distraught Yoongi into the restroom, where he ushers out one guy mid-piss and locks the door behind them.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYoongi gives himself the rest of the weekend. He allows himself to mope and cry and eat and whine and lay completely still, not saying or doing anything, just pitying himself.\nBut on Sunday, from the safety of his blanket burrito, he hears his front door clatter open against his wall, and he would be worried if he didn\u2019t already know that Hoseok made a copy of his house key a few years ago, very much without his permission. For safety, he said.\n\u201cTurn on your phone, you asshat,\u201d Hoseok blurts out from the entryway. \u201cIt's going straight to voicemail.\u201d\n\u201cEuhhhhhgh,\u201d Yoongi groans through four layers of blankets. Last he saw his phone, it was stuffed in his sock drawer so he didn\u2019t have to think about people.\n\u201cI assume you haven\u2019t been out in public this weekend, so brought you groceries.\u201d\nYoongi buries his head further into his blanket pile. \u201cJin loved food.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not dead, Yoongi. He\u2019s just an ass.\u201d\nYoongi grunts as Hoseok slides the bags onto his countertop. \u201cHe had a great ass.\u201d\nHoseok plops down on the couch directly on top of Yoongi's feet, forcing him to grunt and draw them up into his chest. He slaps Yoongi\u2019s ass affectionately. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d\n\u201cFuckin great, never better.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, buddy.\u201d\nHoseok just sits with him for a while as The Bachelorette plays in the background. Yoongi sniffs a little and snuggles into the couch, eyes trained on the TV.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s playing you, JoJo, don\u2019t trust his fake-deep ass!\u201d Yoongi explodes quietly but intensely, lobbing a used tissue at the TV, and Hoseok pats his blanketed ass affectionately.\n\u201cHey, Yoongi?\u201d Hoseok asks after several minutes, and he sounds a little insecure.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m really sorry. If I pushed you too much with this whole thing.\u201d\nYoongi struggles to sit up without the use of his hands, which are trapped in his burrito. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 whatever dude. Not your fault it turned out like this.\u201d\n\u201cI know, I know. I just\u2026 I still feel bad. We all just want you to be happy.\u201d\n\u201cI am well aware,\u201d Yoongi assures him with raised eyebrows. \u201cAnd it\u2019ll be the death of me.\u201d\n\u201cBut really. How are you feeling?\u201d Hoseok repeats, gentler this time.\nYoongi hesitates, collapsing back into the couch and exhaling hard through his nose. \u201cHonestly, it feels worse than with Tae.\u00a0Way\u00a0worse than Tae. Why does it feel so much fucking worse than with Tae?\u201d\nHoseok shrugs, snuggling a little closer to him. \u201cI think maybe because you and Tae were never going to work. You knew that. He knew that. We all knew that. But you and Jin\u2026\u201d he trails off.\nYoongi feels nauseous.\n\u201cBut hey, I'm really proud of you, though. For putting yourself out there. I know that wasn\u2019t easy for you. And look, just because you and Jin may have worked doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s the only guy who will ever work for you. You\u2019re a catch, my friend. And we will not rest until we find you a man. I promise.\u201d\n\u201cHey Hoseok?\u201d\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cCome here,\u201d Yoongi says, arms open wide.\nHoseok looks shocked but pleased as he clambers forward for a hug. \u201cAw, reall- OUCH!\u201d\nHe recoils as Yoongi\u2019s vicious flick resonates against his forehead. \u201cNot even if I\u2019m bleeding in a motherfucking ditch.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCome Monday, he is back, like nothing ever happened. Everyone gives him a wide berth, except Hoseok, who seems to be physically unable to not try and cheer him up, and Taehyung who very obviously feels responsible for the whole catastrophe.\n\u201cDo you want a refill?\u201d Taehyung asks him as he is perched on Yoongi's desk, gesturing at a mostly full mug of coffee.\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cDo you want some lunch? I can order lunch.\u201d\n\u201cIt's nine in the morning, Tae.\u201d\nTaehyung looks desperately around him, clearly determined to find something he can help with. His eyes skim over Yoongi himself, then he does a double take, gaze drifting down slightly. \u201cBlowjob?\u201d\n\u201cGo away!\u201d Yoongi explodes, chucking a pad of post-it notes at Taehyung's face and rising from his chair. Taehyung startled at his advance and scuttles away, looking fearful.\n\u201cHey, he\u2019s just trying to help,\u201d Hoseok says loudly from where he sits in Jin's old cubicle, empty except for a chair. He is tossing a stress ball repeatedly in the air, feet propped up on the desk.\nYoongi rolls his eyes. \u201cYour proper response, as an HR guy, should be, \u2018Well done for rejecting that inappropriate sexual proposition in the workplace.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cI never discourage team building, Yoongi.\u201d The stress ball finally stills in Hoseok's hands, and Yoongi tenses, because he knows that it means Hoseok wants to talk to him about something. \u201cUh hey. Are you going to those interviews today?\u201d\nYoongi plops down in his seat and whirls away from Hoseok, crouching over his desk. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cAh. Right. Well that\u2019s fine. I mean, it's not like you\u2019re literally the only person in this office who can do it- Oh wait.Yep. You are.\u201d\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t you and Namjoon just do it?\u201d Yoongi groans dejectedly.\n\u201cBecause we are hiring another accountant, and neither of us knows shit about accounting. If we aren\u2019t careful, we'll end up with another me. And there is only room for one of me.\u201d\n\u201cYou are literally the worst HR guy ever,\u201d Yoongi allows, pouting.\n\u201cExactly. I am completely unqualified for the job,\u201d Hoseok agrees. \u201cBut hey, don\u2019t you want to choose who you work with? Unlike\u2026 last time\u2026\u201d\nYoongi is very still, scowling at his desk as he hears Hoseok shift nervously behind him. \u201cI\u2019m busy.\u201d\n\u201cYes. Exactly. You are extremely busy. And that is why we are hiring another accountant. So come on,\u201d Hoseok claps his hands expectantly. \u201cLet's go.\u201d\nYoongi just grunts, and Hoseok sighs in frustration behind him.\n\u201cFine, be that way,\u201d Hoseok says, determined, and Yoongi thinks that maybe he\u2019s given up. Until he feels something tight around him. He looks down and sees Hoseok's sweater wrapped around his chest, and it pulls tight as Hoseok uses the sleeves of his sweater to drag his rolling chair backwards, away from his desk.\n\u201cHey! Stop, you ass!\u201d Yoongi demands, struggling feebly against the fabric. Hoseok ignores him, the chair bumping into the cubicle wall as he drags it out.\n\u201cNope. Not letting your breakup blues fuck up anything else your life. This will be good for you.\u201d\nYoongi sighs and slumps as Hoseok drags him and his chair through the office, ignoring his friends' snorts and chuckles as they watch the pair roll slowly across the room.\nWhen they make it to the meeting room, clattering and jolting through the door, Hoseok pushes him into place beside Namjoon and knots the sweater around the back of his chair.\n\u201cStay,\u201d he commands, taking his own place on the other side of Namjoon.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYoongi watches the ashes on the end of his cigarette as they grow precariously long and start to lean low. The door clatters open behind him, and he startles, the ashes jolting loose and swirling down and down, over the side of the balcony. He whirls around, only mildly disappointed this time when he sees a balding middle aged man with an ill-fitting shirt.\nAll of the candidates had been extremely well-qualified, of course.\n\u201cThis one,\u201d Yoongi had said when Namjoon had asked for his top pick, tossing at random the first folder on the pile in Namjoon's direction.\nNamjoon and Hoseok had given each other a badly disguised skeptical look. \u201cFine,\u201d Namjoon had allowed, and that was the end of it.\nThat had been a month ago.\nNow, it's the new hire's first day, and Yoongi is putting off going upstairs. She had been nice enough, quiet and friendly. She had also looked mildly terrified of her surroundings, and who could blame her honestly, when the only view from the window separating the meeting room from the main office was a screaming Jungkook rocketing past on what Yoongi could only assume was an engaged fire extinguisher strapped to a rolling chair.\nSo he figures he'll give her some time to get a little acclimated to her new environment before he throws his own grumpy ass into the mix. If he was a weaker man, his reluctance might also have something to do with seeing Jin's cubicle occupied by someone other than Jin. But Min Yoongi is not a weaker man.\nHis phone buzzes obnoxiously in his pocket. He wonders who would be texting him so early in the morning, but of course it's Hoseok.\n\u00a0\nAsshole #1: hottie alert in the accounting department\n\u00a0\nYoongi scoffs, extinguishing his cigarette in the nearby ashtray and wondering when Hoseok developed a thing for (much) older women.\nBut he is far too tired, too curled in on himself to notice the weirdness in the air or the lingering scent of something sweet and familiar. He is simply as determined as possible to make it through this day with as little interaction with anyone as possible, especially his new cube buddy, Helen.\nHe tucks his head, fumbling with the box of cigarettes and lighter in his hand in an effort to look busy, eyes trained on his own fingers as he blows past Helen\u2019s cubicle. From the sound of it, she isn\u2019t in. Probably off doing orientation or paperwork with Hoseok. Yoongi slings his bag moodily to the floor, opening his email and quickly scanning through to delete the spam of daily lewd comics from Hoseok and Taehyung.\n\u201cHey.\u201d Hoseok\u2019s head appears over the top of his wall.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Yoongi replies, looking confused. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be doing orientation stuff with the new hire?\u201d\n\u201cI mean, we already had most of his stuff on file from before, so there wasn\u2019t much to do.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Yoongi asks evenly, trying to ignore the unpleasant sensation of blood draining from his face.\n\u201cJin. Duh. How did that go by the way? The reunion? Was it totally fucking awkward? Have you guys already re-christened the cube?\u201d\nYoongi is at once keenly aware of his surroundings. The sweetness in the air, that\u2019s Jin\u2019s disgusting, too-sweet coffee. The box sitting on the chair in the cube across the row is filled with neatly-organized file folders and topped with a precarious mountain of wrapped pastries. And that dorky laugh coming from somewhere close by is the same one he\u2019s been hearing in his dreams and nightmares for the past few months.\n\u201cOh. Shit. Has it not happened yet?\u201d Hoseok asks, looking abruptly fearful.\nYoongi is out of his seat, out of his cube, out of the office before he can even make the conscious decision to leave.\n\u201cYoongi, wait!\u201d he hears as the door swings shut behind him, and waiting is the last thing he wants to do, especially when he recognizes that voice. He jogs lightly down the hall, jamming the button for the elevator so hard that it hurts, or it would hurt if he could register anything other than the raw, electrifying panic that is coursing through every vein in his body.\nLuckily for him, the doors slide right open, like the lift was waiting for him. He throws himself inside, urgently pressing the\u00a0Door Close button. After an eternity, the doors finally start to rumble closed, and Yoongi breathes a sigh of relief.\nUntil his heart is in his throat. Until the doors jolt open as a shoe appears in the very last crack of space, and suddenly there is Jin.\u00a0Yoongi feels like his heart has just fallen straight out of his ass.\nJin is breathing hard as he steps inside with Yoongi, allowing the elevator doors to close, leaving them utterly alone.\nYoongi\u2019s\u00a0taken aback, because Jin\u00a0looks intensely vulnerable, so uncharacteristically uncertain, and that softness makes him so painfully beautiful that Yoongi\u2019s heart aches. If he didn\u2019t know he was in love with him before, he sure as fuck knows it now.\n\u201cUm. Hi,\u201d Jin greets him lamely. \u201cThat was\u2026 not how that was supposed to go.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing here?\u201d Yoongi swallows hard, trying to wrap his mind around the situation.\n\u201cI-\u2026 I work here,\u201d Jin says tentatively, with a frightened but hopeful smile.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Yoongi replies, pleased at the anger in his own voice. \u201cNo, you used to work here. So what the fuck are you doing here now?\u201d\n\u201cWell. I, uh, took the accounting job. At the branch.\u201d\n\u201cYou sure don\u2019t look like the middle-aged woman we hired.\u201d\nThe elevator doors slide open to reveal a small crowd of waiting strangers.\n\u201cSorry, this one's full,\u201d Jin apologizes, mashing the\u00a0Door Close\u00a0button violently and ignoring their confused and mildly offended expressions. He presses the button for the highest floor. He turns back to Yoongi once they\u2019re moving again. \u201cTae and Jimin scared her away.\u201d\n\u201cAnd why would they do that?\u201d he demands, arms crossed defensively across his chest.\n\u201cBecause I asked them to?\u201d It sounds like a question, and Yoongi can see the apprehension in his expression.\nHe bristles in anger. \u201cSo let me get this straight.\u201d He licks his lips in annoyance, trying to figure out where to even start. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard from you in over a month, and now you\u2019re just back? For good? With not so much as a heads-up? Who fucking does that?\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Jin allows, nodding as he chews his lip. \u201cThat\u2019s fair. This was probably not the best way to go about this whole thing, but-\u201d\nYoongi scoffs viciously. \u201cThat is an understatement.\u201d\nJin is quiet as he mumbles, \u201cTaehyung said I should make a big gesture.\u201d\n\u201cBig gestures make me panic.\u201d\n\u201cRight. Of course they do. That would be why you ran. This was all one big, dumb thing to do. Motherfucking Kim Taehyung.\u201d It\u2019s Jin who looks angry now, at least for a moment, until his anger fades into something softer that looks like fear. \u201cI bought a house here. I bought a fucking house.\u201d\n\u201cSo I\u2019m just going to let you languish in your buyers\u2019 remorse while I get the fuck out of here, okay?\u201d Yoongi says, turning to the door as the elevator slows once more at another floor.\n\u201cWait! Please just wait,\u201d Jin begs him, grasping onto his sleeve. \u201cAt least let me apologize. I probably should have, you know, led with the apology. But I am an utterly clueless, endlessly selfish coward of such immense magnitude. Please?\u201d\nAs Yoongi is pondering, the doors clatter open to reveal a single young woman, clutching a newspaper, who seems to pick up on the weird atmosphere, and after a few moments of awkward silence, she mumbles, \u201cI\u2019ll get the next one.\u201d\n\u201cWell at least you\u2019re self-aware,\u201d Yoongi glares at him as he turns away from the door as it closes once more, and Jin looks very determinedly at his feet. For a few seconds, the only sound is the mechanical clunking of the elevator as it makes its way up several floors. \u201cJin, why are you here?\u201d\n\u201cBecause,\u201d Jin struggles for the right words, \u201cBecause usually, when I move, it\u2019s like this feeling of relief, like a fresh start. But the second my plane touched down, it was different. It wasn\u2019t exciting or new. It was just\u2026 stale and ugly and shitty. And all I wanted was to be back here. Yoongi, sorry doesn\u2019t even cover it. I owe you a hell of a lot more than an apology.\u201d\nYoongi shifts uncomfortably as the elevator moves between floors 3 and 4. \u201cYou don\u2019t owe me shit. You were always clear with me about what you wanted. Or didn\u2019t want, I guess.\u201d\n\u201cNo, but that\u2019s just it. I do want it. I want it all,\u201d Jin insists, and his eyes are a little desperate now. \u201cI want the house and the cat and the friends and the job. And god, I want you.\" Jin pauses, clearly trying to read Yoongi's reaction. Yoongi tries to keep his face as expressionless as possible, but his insides feel like fireworks and jello. \"I just... didn\u2019t realize how much until I left, and you weren\u2019t there anymore.\u201d\nYoongi eyes him carefully and skeptically, chewing very hard on his lip. \u201cHow\u2026 how do you want me?\u201d he asks, hating how vulnerable it sounds, but he continues regardless, \u201cBecause I can\u2019t\u2026 do what we did before and act like I don\u2019t care about you. I mean, Jesus, you were asking me for those projections before I could even wipe the fucking cum of my desk.\u201d\nJin cringes visibly at the memory. \u201cThat\u2019s- that\u2019s not what I want. That wasn't even what I wanted at the time, I just panicked, and it was such a shitty thing to do, and I'm so fucking sorry. I just want to be with you however you\u2019ll let me.\u201d His hand twitches towards Yoongi for a moment, like he is going to take his hand, but at the last minute, he doesn\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m here until you tell me to leave.\u201d\nYoongi feels himself softening, but part of him is still very bitter. \u201cSo if I tell you to leave right now?\u201d\nJin\u2019s face falls pathetically, and Yoongi is both regretful and extremely satisfied. \u201cThen you have my word. I\u2019m gone.\u201d\nYoongi stands up straighter, and there\u2019s no Christmas Punch on which he can blame this burst of courage. It\u2019s all him when he reaches forward to grab Jin\u2019s hand. Jin looks surprised and flushed and immensely pleased. \u201cAnd if I never tell you to leave?\u201d\nJin smiles then, blinking hard in that cute way that he does, and his eyes look a little sparkly as he squeezes Yoongi\u2019s hand. \u201cThen I\u2019m yours.\u201d\nYoongi allows himself to crack a smile himself, pulling Jin even closer. When the elevator doors open again a moment later, he feels Jin stiffen perceptibly in front of him, and when he follows his gaze, he sees why.\nThe janitor is standing behind his cart, framed by the elevator entrance, looking extremely unamused. The three of them stand there for a moment in an intensely uncomfortable silence, until the doors do them a great mercy and slowly, so slowly rattle shut.\n\u201cWe have really got to stop living out our drama at work,\u201d Yoongi says emotionlessly.\n\"Yeah, can I just reiterate what a bad idea I now recognize this to be?\" Jin replies sheepishly, rubbing his neck.\n\"God you're a dumbass,\" Yoongi says affectionately before dragging Jin's head down to capture his lips in a heated kiss. Yoongi realizes after a moment that they must not have pressed a button, because there is a sea of quiet gasps as the elevator doors slide open, but Yoongi just gropes for the Door Close button and opens his mouth to deepen the kiss. The doors do close, luckily, but a second later, his hand hits another button, and the elevator comes lurching to a stop, the alarm ringing insistently. Yoongi looks over and sees his hand on the Emergency Stop button.\u00a0\nHe looks back at Jin, who just quirks an eyebrow and pulls Yoongi closer. He's hard.\u00a0\"We should like\u2026 stop living our drama at work tomorrow, right?\u201d Jin says lightly, testing the waters.\nYoongi sighs hard through his nose. \u201cThrow your jacket on the security camera and take off your pants.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\"Okay, so against my better judgement, this is happening. Welcome everyone to the first and possibly last team-building seminar, led by our illustrious Sales Team,\" Namjoon says soullessly. \"Before we start to engage in whatever team-building activity you two have planned, I figure we could all get some general pointers from you two, as you are, somehow, the most successful Sales Team in our entire corporation. So. What's the secret to your teamwork?\"\nJimin and Taehyung look at each other and shrug, then Jimin speaks up. \"I guess I would have to say... sex?\"\n\"Okay,\" Namjoon nods, brows furrowed but face otherwise unchanged. \"Interesting metaphor. So what you're saying is that teamwork is a lot like sex. Mutually beneficial.\"\n\"Usually,\" Jimin mumbles, eyebrow quirked, and Taehyung gasps like he's been slapped.\u00a0\n\"So what kinds of things do you guys do as a team to maintain that bond?\" Namjoon prompts them further, resting his chin on his folded hands and leaning forward.\u00a0\n\"Lots of oral mostly. Like insane amounts of oral,\" Taehyung shrugs. \"Luckily, we're both really into it.\"\n\"Oral communication,\" Namjoon mutters seriously, still nodding. \"Good, good. Yes, communication is key to teamwork. We could all engage a little more orally around here.\"\nJungkook stifles his laughter, and Jimin and Taehyung just look at Namjoon with vague, confused smiles.\u00a0\n\"Uh... right,\" Taehyung continues. \"But I would also say that it's important to do a lot of like... emotional and spiritual maintenance. Sex is one thing, but at the end of the day, marriage is impossible if you don't constantly do work on that emotional bond as you both change and grow.\"\n\"Yes, yes, the closeness required between teammates for the honest exchange and marriage of ideas,\" Namjoon agrees, and Yoongi rolls his eyes so hard that it hurts. \"Collaboration. Trust. All of these things are key. Anything else?\"\n\"Uh.... Assplay?\" Jimin adds, looking to Taehyung for confirmation. Taehyung nods vigorously.\u00a0\nNamjoon's expression remains unchanged, but his eyes are suddenly unblinking and wide. \"Excuse me?\"\n\"Yeah, like, mutual assplay. We find that it preserves our power dynamic and keeps us on equal footing sexually,\" Taehyung explains very matter-of-factly, Jimin nodding quietly beside him.\u00a0\n\"And by assplay you mean...\" Namjoon prompts them, and Yoongi sees the fear in his eyes now.\u00a0\n\"...Assplay,\" Jimin confirms.\u00a0\"Wow, I really can't believe we are allowed to talk about this at work.\"\nIt's silent.\n\"I'm sorry, I'm not following. That sounds... sexual,\" Namjoon shakes his head, face crumpled in confusion now.\u00a0\n\"It is very sexual,\" Taehyung clarifies, \"It's... assplay.\"\n\"You mean...\" Namjoon starts, the horror setting in on his face. \"You... and Jimin... do assplay\u2026 with each other?\u201d\n\u201cUh\u2026 yes,\u201d Taehyung confirms. \u201cWe also do lots of other sexual things. That\u2019s\u2026 what couples do.\u201d\n\u201cCouples?\" Hoseok asks, eyes wide. \u201cYou guys are a couple?\u201d\n\"Are you fucking kidding me?\" Jimin demands, springing to his feed in indignant anger. \u201cWe have been married for two fucking years.\u201d\nTotal silence.\n\u201cWh\u2026aaat?\u201d Hoseok breathes from beside Yoongi, and Namjoon is just silent now.\n\u201cYou guys were at the goddamn wedding!\u201d Jimin fumes, and Taehyung is just shaking in silent laughter beside him.\n\u201cYou mean the friendship ceremony?\u201d Hoseok asks, and Jimin throws up his hands in exasperation.\n\u201cWow, you guys are unbelievable!\u201d Jimin exclaims, pacing now. \u201cWe have been fucking in the supply closet at least once a week for the past several years. Jungkook, how many times have you walked in on me with Tae\u2019s dick in my mouth?\u201d\n\u201cThe\u2026 brojobs?\u201d\nThe conversation quickly devolves into confused squabbling, and Yoongi just sits back in his seat, leaning lightly against Jin as the chaos unfolds before him.\n\u201cCan I just take this opportunity to say \u2018I told you so,\u2019\u201d Jin whispers to him as Jimin and Taehyung re-enact an obvious sex act in way of explanation. When he doesn\u2019t receive a response, he looks at Yoongi quizzically. \u201cOkay, you are like weirdly quiet and chill about this.\u201d\n\u201cI already knew,\u201d Yoongi tells him with a small smile. \u201cOr at least I guessed, that time I almost killed Tae in the supply closet. He said something that kind of explained everything that\u2019s happened since 2010. I guess I was willfully blind.\u201d\n\u201cWell we\u2019re all guilty of being willfully blind sometimes,\u201d Jin says gently as he entwines their hands together and strokes the skin of Yoongi\u2019s hand with his thumb.\n\u201cOn my DESK, Tae? Seriously?\u201d Namjoon explodes.\n\u201cHey, it wasn\u2019t just us! They did it, too!\u201d Taehyung defends himself, pointing his finger at Yoongi and Jin, and Yoongi just smirks at the memory. That\u00a0had been a good day.\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t put this on us,\u201d Jin says calmly. \u201cRaise your hand if you have not had sex on Namjoon\u2019s desk.\u201d\nNot a single hand.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYoongi thinks that Jin has never looked as beautiful as he does in the soft, orange light emitting from the bonfire made from Namjoon\u2019s desk.\n\u201cYou want to get out of here?\u201d Yoongi asks gently, leaning forward to press his forehead against Jin\u2019s. Jin nods, shutting his eyes and sighing contentedly. \u201cHey guys, we\u2019re out.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? No way! This is a mandatory post-hours social event,\u201d Hoseok argues, and the marshmallow that he is roasting over the burning leg of the desk busts into flames.\n\u201cFirst of all, that is not a real thing and second of all we are leaving to do something very important and work-related,\u201d Yoongi protests, holding Jin\u2019s hand defiantly. \u201cAccounting Department Stuff. Vital to the functionality of our branch.\u201d\n\u201cSay team building,\u201d Namjoon dares him, eyes hard. \u201cSay it.\u201d\nYoongi chews his lip in contemplation. \u201cI was gonna go with Oral Communication Seminar.\u201d\nNamjoon collapses into a folding camp chair that someone had dug out of their car. \u201cGo. Just go.\u201d\n\u201cHey, wait a second,\u201d Hoseok calls after them. \u201cWhat do you say you guys let me film your session for this little HR Training video that I\u2019m working on? Very tasteful. Jimin and Taehyung have already contributed.\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say \u2018contributed\u2019 so much as I would say that he found our pornhub channel,\u201d Taehyung clarifies as he gently cups Jimin\u2019s butt.\n\u201cYou literally have a link to it in your email signatures,\u201d Hoseok points out.\n\u201cYou WHAT?\u201d Namjoon demands, marshmallows spilling from his mouth.\n\u201cIt\u2019s only for internal branch emails,\u201d Jimin assures them calmly.\n\u201cAnd you did didn\u2019t see this as an HR issue? Or like, a potential lawsuit?\u201d Namjoon groans, now slumped in his lawn chair, head thrown back in despair.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Hoseok scoffs. \u201cYou heard the man. Internal emails only. We\u2019re safe. Like, no one in this branch would rat us out.\u201d After a moment, he adds, \u201cExcept Jungkook. Jungkook might rat us out.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s true, he tried to sell me to a hotdog vendor when he was drunk last week,\u201d Jimin reveals.\n\u201cFuck you, I\u2019m ride or die!\u201d Jungkook says indignantly.\n\u201cYou are all fired. Every single one of you,\u201d Namjoon tells them very seriously.\n\u201cNo we\u2019re not,\u201d Hoseok says without shame or hesitation.\n\u201cAnyway, what\u2019s wrong with wanting to share our love with our closest friends?\u201d Taehyung says, entwining his fingers with Jimin\u2019s. \u201cPlus, we\u2019re actually married, which makes what we do in those videos basically wholesome.\u201d\nHoseok chokes on a marshmallow that he has jut shoved in his mouth. \u201cI would not call what you were doing to Jimin \u2018wholesome.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cHi, can we leave now?\u201d Yoongi asks.\n\u201cNo,\u201d several voices shout in unison.\n\u201cOkay well we are leaving anyway because we are adults who do not require your permission so fuck you guys, and also Hoseok\u2019s sleeve is on fire,\u201d Yoongi informs them, dragging Jin behind him, back into the building so that they can grab their bags from upstairs before they go. Hoseok\u2019s scream echoes off the side of the building, followed shortly by a roar of intense laughter.\nThey\u2019ve just stepped through the door into their office when Yoongi\u2019s phone chimes.\n\u201cWho is it?\u201d Jin asks. \u201cIs it them? Hoseok didn\u2019t actually die, right?\u201d\nYoongi\u2019s brow furrows in confusion. \u201cIt\u2019s a blank email from Jimin.\u201d\n\u201cA blank email?\u201d\n\u201cYeah there is literally nothing here except- oh.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cExcept his email signature,\u201d Yoongi says evenly, thumb hovering uncertainly over the link.\n\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Jin breathes, pulling Yoongi\u2019s hand closer to get a better look. \u201cHoseok wasn\u2019t kidding. Look. It\u2019s right there.\u201d\nYoongi scoffs but does not move his finger. \u201cGross\u2026 right?\u201d\n\u201cOh, completely.\u201d Jin says just a little too loud. A pause. \u201cRight?\u201d\n\u201cTotally,\u201d Yoongi confirms, then quieter, \u201cBut like\u2026 What do you think he was doing to Jimin?\u201d He looks at Jin, who looks right back.\nThey have a moment of silent communication, and then Yoongi\u2019s mumbling an unconvincing \u201cOops\u201d as his thumb clicks the link. There are a few seconds of familiar giggling, then that giggle dissolves into a moan, and they are officially in too deep.\n\u201cIs Namjoon\u2019s office still unlocked?\u201d Jin asks casually, eyes trained on the small screen in front of them.\n\u201cYep,\u201d Yoongi says, jaw slack as his eyes are trained unwaveringly on the screen in front of him.\n\u201cDo you wanna\u2026\u201d Jin trails off raising his eyebrows suggestively.\n\u201cYep.\u201d\n\u201cAre you bringing the pho-\u201d\n\u201cYep.\u201d\n\u201cWe are going straight to hel-\u201d\n\u201cYep.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0"
