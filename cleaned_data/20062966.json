They make my ears feel all cozy, and protected.\u00a0\nCROWLEY: Suit yourself.\u00a0\nAZIRAPHALE: And\u2014 oh! Your voice sounds  lovely all up close like that\u2014\nCROWLEY: [clears throat] Well. Anyway.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n[THEME SONG PLAYS]\n[QUEEN - RADIO GA GA]\n\u00a0\nCROWLEY: Welcome to the inaugural episode of The Ineffable Plan: an advice show for the post-apocalyptic era\u2014\nAZIRAPHALE: I just want to point out that this whole thing was  your  idea, Crowley. \u2026 You know, so people are aware. Credit where credit is due, and all.\nCROWLEY: Of course it was  my  idea. Until last week  you  thought podcasting was a farming technique.\nAZIRAPHALE: Not\u2026 an unreasonable assumption to make, given the etymological implications of\u2014\nCROWLEY: [laughing]\nAZIRAPHALE: Anyway. I\u2019m Aziraphale, and this is my\u2026 associate, Anthony J. Crowley.\u00a0\nCROWLEY: Thanks to recent events, we\u2019ve found ourselves with quite a bit of spare time on our hands.\nAZIRAPHALE:  We are very qualified to give advice on h\u2014  people  problems.\nCROWLEY: Perhaps the most qualified of all time.\u00a0\nAZIRAPHALE: We\u2019ve really been around!\u00a0\nCROWLEY: Shall we get into it?\u00a0\nAZIRAPHALE: Indeed! Righty-o, here\u2026 are the letters I\u2019ve received, let\u2019s see\u2026\n[the sound of paper rustling]\nCROWLEY: You had people send in  letters?  When you said you set up a mailbox I thought you meant  email\u2013\u00a0 \nAZIRAPHALE: Ahem. This shall do nicely to start us off. Question one. This is from Andrea in Hackney\u2014 hello, my dear\u2014 and she says:\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n I live in a ground floor flat, and I work the night shift, so I get home really late. My upstairs neighbor has taken to playing EDM at extremely loud volumes early in the morning, I assume to accompany some kind of body-weight workout, because there\u2019s the sound of something heavy hitting the floor over and over as well. It\u2019s ruining my sleep schedule and making me unproductive at work. How do I end this torment?\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0\nCROWLEY:  First of all, Andrea, are you sure you\u2019ve not done anything to  deserve  said torment?\u00a0\nAZIRAPHALE: Crowley! That isn\u2019t advice.\u00a0\nCROWLEY: [sighs] Fine, fine. This is an easy one. Here\u2019s what you do. When you get home from your shift, grab a knife, shimmy up the drainpipe, get the window open, and sneak into the upstairs flat. Cut the cables to the subwoofers, pitch the weights out the window, then climb back down and sleep soundly.\u00a0\u00a0\nAZIRAPHALE:  I hardly think  any  of that will be necessary. All you need to do is climb a flight of stairs, knock on their door, and have a polite, face-to-face conversation regarding their disruptive activities.\nCROWLEY:  And  what  if they laugh in her face and say,  it\u2019s my apartment, I can do what I want?  Then what\u2019ll she do? It\u2019s not gonna be as simple as hello, goodbye, thank you! I know how these people are! No, this issue demands  direct action.\u00a0 \nAZIRAPHALE: I see what you\u2019re trying to do, Crowley, you wily serpent, but I refuse to endorse breaking and entering on a radiophonic programme meant for public consumption\u2014\nCROWLEY:   Podcast.  It\u2019s a podcast.\nAZIRAPHALE: \u2014 have you considered that the neighbor might be going through some personal difficulties, and is trying to make a lifestyle change for their own benefit?\u00a0\nCROWLEY:  Hey, Andrea, have you got speakers? You could play even  worse  music even  louder. \u00a0\u00a0\nAZIRAPHALE:  Andrea, if you just wait a little while longer, surely they will just  give up on their self-improvement regimen, which is the end result of most similar resolutions\u2014\u00a0\nCROWLEY: Andrea, you could slide a threatening note under their door, one with the little magazine letters cut out\u2014\nAZIRAPHALE: \u2026 Oh dear. Is every episode going to be like this?\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nEPISODE 3\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n[...]\n\u00a0\nAZIRAPHALE: This one is from James in Bath. He wants to know, Crowley, what does the J stand for?\u00a0\nCROWLEY: Wouldn\u2019t you like to know.\u00a0\nAZIRAPHALE: That settles it, then. I\u2019m sure  nobody  else has to send in that question  ever again, now would they\u2014?\nCROWLEY: Aziraphale!\n\u00a0\n[AD BREAK]\n[soothing, New Age yoga music playing in the background]\n\u00a0\nMADAME TRACY: Madame Tracy Draws Aside The Veil is now available for bookings.

No, it was New York! You wore that lovely red puffer jacket\u2014\nCROWLEY: Oh god. That thing was horrid!\u00a0\nAZIRAPHALE: Everything becomes horrid for you after 10 years of owning it, I don\u2019t see how that\u2014\nCROWLEY:  Hold on. Hold  on.  What was the original question? That we were supposed to be talking about?\u00a0\nAZIRAPHALE: My my, I\u2019ve forgotten. Something about \u2026 furniture? Does it matter?\u00a0\nCROWLEY: \u2026 Nah.\u00a0\nAZIRAPHALE:  Anyway. It was  definitely  Broadway\u2014\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nmargarine-of-error\n\nOK thanks to a million posts on my dash about it, I\u2019ve finally given in and started listening to The Ineffable Plan podcast. And it\u2019s just as amazing as everyone\u2019s said, I\u2019m dying laughing, but idk if there\u2019s something wrong with me because I honest to god am 10 episodes in and cannot figure out if the hosts are real guys or if they\u2019re just playing characters. There\u2019s like, a lot going on. Someone help me lmao.\n\u00a0\n\nfifteenfears\n\nnoooo lmfao asdlksdf i love when people think this. but they\u2019re real dudes. my dad actually worked with crowley at one point. the guy used to be some kind of london business cryptid, one of those independent consultants who\u2019d come in and fuck everything up. iconic tbh. his old website is still up - anthonyjcrowley.com/consulting\n\u00a0\n\nelektrahartt\n\nYUPPP chiming in to confirm they\u2019re actual regular degular people... i\u2019ve been to aziraphale\u2019s bookstore in london, but that was before the podcast started when i was studying abroad there. i only realized he was THAT \u201cA.Z. Fell\u201d when crowley was teasing him in the last ep about his ridiculous shop hours and i was like OHHH lol that makes sense.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nEPISODE 12:\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n[...]\n\u00a0\nCROWLEY: OK, next question.\u00a0\n[paper shuffling]\nAZIRAPHALE: [humming as he reads] ...Oh! How delightful.\nCROWLEY: What is it?\nAZIRAPHALE:  Crowley, we have our very first  complaint! \nCROWLEY: \u2026 Give that here! [laughs]\u00a0\nAZIRAPHALE:  Hey,  I  do the reading\u2014\nCROWLEY:  Nonono,  please let me read this, it\u2019s too good\u2014\nAZIRAPHALE: Very well.\u00a0\nCROWLEY: [still laughing] This one is from Harold in Cambridge, who says:\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n I appreciate your commitment to the bit, as it were, but as a PhD candidate in Irish History at Cambridge I couldn\u2019t help but cringe continuously through your story in Episode 10 about the Battle of Clontarf. If you\u2019re going to be playing up this whole \u201cimmortality\u201d joke, you really ought to be doing proper research. All contemporary scholarship suggests that Brian Boru was killed while at rest, praying in his tent. It would have taken a miracle at his age to get him up and fighting, as you describe\u2014 \n\n\u00a0\nAZIRAPHALE:  And maybe it  did!\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nCROWLEY: [laughing]\n\u00a0\n\n \u2014 and additionally, Gormflaith goading the Vikings into attacking the Irish is a pseudohistorical myth, there is nothing to evidence she ever convinced her son Sigtrygg to go to war against Boru.\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0\nI dunno,  Harold,  she seemed pretty enthusiastic about the idea when I suggested it, but we were both fairly off our heads on mead at the time, so I suppose we\u2019ll never really know!\u00a0\nAZIRAPHALE: [laughing] Dear me. We better not breathe a word about Cahokia, if this is the sort of thing we\u2019re in for.\u00a0\nCROWLEY: Or the Queen of Sheba.\u00a0\nAZIRAPHALE: Or The King\u2019s Men. Would really be a shame to be set upon by Anti-Stratfordians.\nCROWLEY: Vicious buggers.\u00a0\u00a0\nAZIRAPHALE: Utter twats. Unintelligent, shameful, elitist\u2013\nCROWLEY: Do keep going.\u00a0\nAZIRAPHALE: \u2026 I\u2019d better not.\n\u00a0\n\nEPISODE 15:\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n[...]\n\u00a0\nCROWLEY:  ...but if you  really want to wind him up, might I suggest taking the time to empty out all of the Splenda packets, replace their contents with garlic powder, and carefully glue them shut again before putting them back in his coffee tray. Never met a problem a good old Condiment Surprise couldn\u2019t solve.\nAZIRAPHALE:  First of all,  don\u2019t do that, Andrew. Second of all, Crowley, garlic powder isn\u2019t a condiment, it\u2019s a seasoning.\nCROWLEY: What? That\u2019s ridiculous. If it goes on food after it\u2019s done cooking, it\u2019s a condiment.\u00a0\nAZIRAPHALE:  You are sorely mistaken, my dear. It\u2019s a  spice, that\u2019s a completely separate category.\u00a0\nCROWLEY:  No, it  isn\u2019t!\u00a0 \nAZIRAPHALE:  Anyway, what would  you know about the finer details of culinary preparation?\nCROWLEY: Excuse you, I spent a decade as a galley cook on a Spanish Galleon traversing the Atlantic, you\u2019d be shocked to see what I can do with a hunk of salted pork.\u00a0\nAZIRAPHALE:  A  pirate  ship? Not exactly Cordon Bleu\u2014\nCROWLEY: Says the man who\u2019s not prepared his own food since the Peloponnesian War.\u00a0\nAZIRAPHALE:  It\u2019s just  better  when  hu\u2013\u00a0  er. When  other people make it!\nCROWLEY: Want to pout harder? I don\u2019t think our listeners can hear it through their speakers quite yet.\u00a0\nAZIRAPHALE: [pouts audibly]\nCROWLEY:  There you go.  Anyway,  garlic powder is, in fact, a  condiment, and one which you should\u2014\nAZIRAPHALE:   \u2014should not\u2014 \nCROWLEY: \u2014replace your terrible boss\u2019s terrible Splenda with, and make sure you\u2019ve got an unobstructed line of sight to him when he starts drinking it. Maybe try and get it on camera?\nAZIRAPHALE: [sighs]\n\u00a0\n[...]\n\u00a0\nCROWLEY: I try not to make a habit of gratitude, but I must give our appreciation to everyone out there who\u2019s been listening and subscribing to The Ineffable Plan.\u00a0\nAZIRAPHALE: Ooh, yes, we\u2019ve become quite popular, haven\u2019t we?\u00a0\nCROWLEY:  Yeah, just hit number eight on the advice charts \u2026 No advertising at all.\nAZIRAPHALE: Mm. How \u2026 miraculous.\nCROWLEY: \u2026   Aziraphale.  You did  not. \nAZIRAPHALE:  It\u2019s just\u2014\u00a0you work so  hard  on putting it all together, my dear, I thought it would be a shame if it all ended up flying under the radar, so I just gave it a little push, as it were\u2014 why  are you looking at me like that\u2014\nCROWLEY: \u2026 Thank you.\u00a0\nAZIRAPHALE: I\u2014\u00a0 Oh. Er. Yes, quite. No problem at all.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n @keldevine \n\nany other  @IneffablePod  listeners desperately trying to figure out if the hosts are  actually a couple or just best friends with really great banter?\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n @Phoebe_Loop13 \n\n@keldevine @IneffablePod omfg i thought i was the only one.

My dear boy, I rather thought you\u2019d given up on that sort of thing!\nCROWLEY: Change is in the air. I had to outdo that fetching ear piercing of yours somehow.\nAZIRAPHALE: Oh, you noticed? I thought I\u2019d\u2014\nCROWLEY: [quickly] Don\u2019t flatter yourself. I\u2019ve been meaning to do this for a while.\nAZIRAPHALE: Well, I don\u2019t like it.\nCROWLEY: And when have I ever cared what  you  liked?\u00a0\nAZIRAPHALE: Oh, I don\u2019t know, since Rome? First time we dined together? And you only tried the oysters because I described in  great detail how much I enjoyed them\u2014\nCROWLEY: Mm.\u00a0\n[a pause]\nAZIRAPHALE: Dearest listeners, please feel free to chime in with  your personal opinions on Crowley\u2019s new facial hair, you can send your comments to the usual address\u2014\u00a0\u00a0\nCROWLEY: No, no, please, they don\u2019t even know what it  looks  like, how is that even fair\u2014!\nAZIRAPHALE: I\u2019ll be posting a photo on the, er, instant gram\u2014\nCROWLEY:  I  know you don\u2019t know how to do that.\u00a0\nAZIRAPHALE: [firmly] I will make it so that a photo has been posted\u2013\u00a0\nCROWLEY: Let\u2019s just get on with the advice?\u00a0\nAZIRAPHALE: Very well.\u00a0\n[papers shuffling]\nAZIRAPHALE: Here we are\u2026 from Mina in Manchester. She asks:\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n I work in a large office, where the dress code is fairly business formal. I\u2019m one of the only women on my floor, and during the summer all the men are still in suits, so the aircon is cranked up to maximum. My teeth start chattering and I get such bad goosebumps I can hardly concentrate on my analysis. They won\u2019t let me have a blanket out at my desk, but they also won\u2019t budge on the temperature. What do I do?\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0\nAZIRAPHALE: Oh, how terrible. Central air\u2019s supposed to be one of ours! Look how it\u2019s being perverted!\u00a0\u00a0\nCROWLEY: Hey. Aren\u2019t we trying to stop doing that?

I get it.\nAZIRAPHALE: Anyway, Mina, you sound like a wonderfully competent young lady. Perhaps your skills would be better served at a company with better commitment to equitable gender balance, and a more respectful approach to temperature control\u2014\u00a0\nCROWLEY:  Mina, I think  you  should start wearing a full suit to work.

Probably Pacific Rim\u2014\u00a0oh, you wouldn\u2019t like it. Although there is a character who\u2013\u00a0look, nevermind. Besides, when was the last time  you  bought a ticket to  anything? Don\u2019t you just, you know, waltz right in there?

Anyway, yes, darling, you can\u2019t keep yourself in constant distress for the sake of propriety. Best to tell your mother how her habits have affected your state of mind. It might be \u2026 hard to admit, and it might take \u2026 some time, but the more you work at it, the more ready you\u2019ll be\u2014\u00a0\nCROWLEY: You could also just stop speaking to her, forever. That might do the trick.\u00a0\nAZIRAPHALE: No! Don\u2019t listen to him. Listen to me\u2014\nCROWLEY: [laughs]\nAZIRAPHALE: What\u2013 oh.

You\u2019re talking about drones.\u00a0\nAZIRAPHALE: Yes! Those are the ones. She could send one up\u2014\u00a0\nCROWLEY:  No! That is  overkill!  It\u2019d be spotted in a second!

So here we are picking up on all this stuff that probably flies right past them in the moment as theyre recording. Hence our obsession with \u201cI loved your hair long\u201d from ep 18 which crowley didn\u2019t even seem to HEAR (!!!!) or \u201cangel, you ruin me\u201d from this week\u2026 like?????\n#ineffable husbands\n\u00a0\n\npundergroundd\n\ncrowley edits the show though doesnt he??? wouldnt that require sitting through the eps multiple times?\n\u00a0\n\ntinygaymouse\n\nI mean hes the one who posts the eps bc aziraphale is computer illiterate lmfao but if you listen you can tell that they\u2019re not edited at all, apart from adding in ad breaks sometimes and the theme song. Tbh he seems like the kind of adhd guy who doesnt have the attention span to sit down and edit an hourlong pod every week although that may be me projecting.\n\u00a0\n\npundergroundd\n\nOk yeah i see what youre saying\u2026 is it crazy to hc that he just started the show so he could have another reason to sit and talk w aziraphale and the editing/posting is a total afterthought ??\n\u00a0\n\ntinygaymouse\n\nNO THATS SO VALID\u2026 HONESTLY REAL !!!!!!!\n\u00a0\n\nEPISODE 22\n\n\u00a0\n[...]\n\u00a0\nAZIRAPHALE: This one is from Brandon in York, hello.

How should I ask her about this?\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0\nCROWLEY: Well, she obviously took it. Probably to get back at you for something you said.\nAZIRAPHALE: Now, that\u2019s not fair.
