    "text": "They decide to tell everybody.\u00a0\nThere\u2019s no real reason to hide it, and they\u2019re in the perfect age for marriage anyway, so neither of them makes a huge fuss about it.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not a big deal.\nHe and Lan Wangji were working on a case together. One of those that really stays with you. Family of an abusive father was suing for insurance money from estranged children, because they weren\u2019t a part of his life in the last couple of years. They hired lawyers from Beijing, and the entire thing was highly publicized because one of them was an online celebrity. They had to pull all-nighters for nearly a week with the amount of material they had to go through to find loopholes \u2014 and that sort of thing  bonds people. Even if they were at each other\u2019s throats before, they had to put all their differences aside to work together\u2026 and somehow, it turned out they weren\u2019t all that different after all.\u00a0\nIt just sort of happened. And that sort of stuff was important to Lan Wangji, and Wei Wuxian agreed to give it a go; worst case scenario they\u2019d get a clean divorce and each will keep the other\u2019s assets.\u00a0\nJiang Cheng is the first person they talk to, monday morning, after the papers come back from court, signed and sealed.\n\u201cWe got drunk last Saturday after winning the case \u2014 Lan Wangji is sort of wild when he\u2019s drunk, who would\u2019ve thought? So, we started to make out, and man, all I\u2019m thinking is how good we are at this and how good he is with his tongue, and how big his dick is - and it\u2019s huge dude, it\u2019s the Eiffel Tower of dicks \u2014 no, the  Burj Khalifa  of dicks \u2014\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji nudges, urging him to cut to the chase.\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m getting there, calm down, So we decided to get married, and this big guy\u2014\u201d He shoves a thumb back at Lan Wangji\u2019s large chest; \u201c\u2014 agrees. So we drive to one of those really sleazy marriage parlors downtown, and get married. And apparently, they\u2019re legit. We got a certificate and everything.\u201d\nJiang Cheng has his face in his hand, and his elbow on the counter, and he looks like he\u2019s been bored with the story before Wei Wuxian even started talking.\u00a0\n\u201cSo?\u201d\n\u201cSo what?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the punchline?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWhat punchline, dude? I\u2019m telling you I got married.\u201d\u00a0\nJiang Cheng looks between him and Lan Wangji, and seems like he\u2019s generally done with the idea of Wei Wuxian existing; \u201cRight.\u201d He rolls his eyes, straightens, and collects his files to go back to his desk.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian looks back to Lan Wangji, and Lan Wangji shrugs.\u00a0\nMonday morning isn\u2019t Jiang Cheng\u2019s brightest hour, so they leave it be.\u00a0\nThe next person they talk to is Lan Xichen, at lunch.\nWei Wuxian can tell that Lan Wangji is a bit nervous, so he does the talking for the both of him.\u00a0\nHe\u2019s at his desk, having his morning coffee, and he actually listens intently, which is already a huge improvement \u2014 and for propriety's sake, Wei Wuxian edits out the bit about how big Lan Wangji\u2019s dick is, since it\u2019s his brother, and all. He\u2019s the senior managing partner in their office, and most of the cases go through him, but despite the menacing position, he\u2019s an exceptionally easy person to talk with.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been included in the office prankings before.\u201d He says, when he realizes that Wei Wuxian finished talking, almost as if he, too, was waiting for a punchline. \u201cThis is kind of fun and exciting. Do want me to make an announcement to the rest of the crew later on, to make it seem more real\u2026?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNo, we were kind of hoping to tell people on her own...\u201d Wei Wuxian scratches his head.\u00a0\n\u201cGe, this isn\u2019t a prank\u2014\u201d\u00a0 Lan Wangji is about to explain, but the phone rings, and Lan Xichen picks it up promptly.\u00a0\nThey both look at each other, before Lan Wangji sighs, and says, much more quietly; \u201cI\u2019ll talk to him later.\u201d\n\u201cWe said we should do it together, though.\u201d\u00a0\nLan Xichen puts his call on hold; \u201cI really need to go through some documents with an associate, but don\u2019t worry,\u201d He winks at them; \u201cI\u2019m totally on board with this  marriage .\u201d\u00a0\nThey sort of file out of the room, a bit discouraged, and before Lan Wangji closes the door, his brother calls out for him, and says; \u201cI\u2019m really happy you\u2019re finally making friends in the office.\u201d\nLan Wangji nods sort of absently and closes the door.\u00a0\nAnd thing is \u2014 nobody else believes them. Nobody in the office, nobody in Wei Wuxian\u2019s circle of friends.\u00a0\nWen Ning looks a bit insulted that Wei Wuxian would joke around with him like that. Wen Qing asks Lan Wangji why is he going along with Wei Wuxian\u2019s bullshit. Nie Huaisung bursts into laughter.\u00a0\nEven Yanli is oddly dismissive.\nShe sort of thinks it\u2019s a joke, and when Wei Wuxian explains it isn\u2019t, she holds onto his hand and says; \u201cI\u2019m sorry. This is my fault, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019ve been going on and on about how married life would suit you, Xian-xian. But you don\u2019t have to feel pressured. You can do it on your own time. I don\u2019t need you to bring fake boyfriends for my approval, okay?\u201d\u00a0\nAnd that\u2019s it.\u00a0\nThing is \u2014 they\u2019re not in a rush. They have time.\u00a0\nThey take things slow. And the entire thing is sort of under a huge question mark for both of them. They got married while drunk, so obviously this isn\u2019t the ideal and who knows, maybe a few months from now, they\u2019ll get bored with each other.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n.\n\n\n\nTheir law firm is among the busiest, and work is hectic; especially for junior associates, like the both of them. Most of the time they\u2019re not working on the same cases, too. It\u2019s hard to find time for a relationship in all of that, so it takes them a while to figure themselves out.\u00a0\nThings they like, things they tolerate, things that are off the table. What makes the other shudder, like that sweet spot behind Lan Wangji\u2019s ear. Or what turns the other on, like when Wei Wuxian wears Lan Wangji\u2019s oversized shirt, because he forgot to bring a change of clothes, and came to his place straight from the office.\u00a0\nSome things are more difficult for them; it\u2019s hard to get used to the presence of another person in your life, and it\u2019s hard to digest that it\u2019s going to be there long term. But sometimes it\u2019s too easy, because they  click together.\nIt always feels \u2014 new. Exciting and thrilling and toe-curling. It feels  right . And Wei Wuxian can\u2019t picture himself doing anything else \u2014 or anybody else, that is \u2014 but this.\u00a0\nThere\u2019s also a bunch of bonuses that come along with it; Lan Wangji\u2019s libido is much more active than anybody else Wei Wuxian was with, and that\u2019s exactly up his alley. Plus, sneaking out for a quickie in the stairway during lunch, or a blowjob in the bathroom when the office is out for drinks.\u00a0\nThe way Wei Wuxian sees it, doing it behind people\u2019s backs tops regular sex (although sex with Lan Wangji is in no way regular, not in human terms, anyway), and as loving husband, Lan Wangji supports this theory (though, he never said it out loud, but seems to commit to it in practice).\u00a0\nIn may, almost a year into their marriage, they finally find a good flat, close to the office, with enough space for them both, and the coziest master bedroom that has large windows that overlook the city. It\u2019s perfect, and they\u2019re both a little done with the migration between their apartments. So they buy it.\u00a0\nBy that time, the popular opinion among their colleagues and friends is that Lan Wangji lost a bet to Wei Wuxian, and because he\u2019s such an honorable young man, he keeps up to his word, even if it\u2019s been over a year, and that Wei Wuxian,  that rascal , enjoys the running gag.\u00a0\nThere\u2019s actually an ongoing bet between the secretaries; every monday morning, they come up to ask Lan Wangji something casual, something that would confirm that he\u2019s still married \u2014 and every single week, he politely declines the blind dates and group hook-ups, with the excuse of his marriage.\u00a0\nEven them moving in together doesn\u2019t raise question marks. People just assume it\u2019s a coincidence that they\u2019re both moving into a new apartment during the same time and that they had somehow decided to use it for their little joke. Har-har.\nJiang Yanli can\u2019t come to their house warming party, because of the weather\u2019s bad, and her flights have been canceled. Jiang Cheng is an absolute shit and cancels last minute because of a booty call. Nie Huaisang also cancels (Wei Wuxian is kind of sure that Jiang Cheng told him he has to buy an expensive housewarming present and the guy just couldn\u2019t take the pressure). Wen Qing and Wen Ning are at their uncle\u2019s funeral for the week.\nThe only one that does come over is Lan Xichen \u2014 he\u2019s the one guest Lan Wangji invited, and when he comes over, he\u2019s thrilled to see Wei Wuxian there.\u00a0\n\u201cYou should also get a congratulation! I heard you got a new flat, as well.\u201d\n\u201cWell, actually,\u201d Wei Wuxian starts saying, but then looks at Lan Wangji who snorts and shakes his head at him, placing a hand over his nape, reassuringly, and Wei Wuxian\u2019s shoulders slump.\nHe\u2019s right. It wouldn\u2019t fucking matter, because nobody believes them at this point.\u00a0\nHe\u2019s sort of convinced that even if he\u2019d bring any of those people over, and literally show them Lan Wangji\u2019s closet which is next to his closet or point at any of Lan Wangji\u2019s stuff, they\u2019d say something frustrating, like; \u201cOh, Lan Wangji has something just like that!\u201d\nThat night, after a vigorous apartment  christening , Wei Wuxian sits between Lan Wangji\u2019s legs, as they lean back, enjoying the view, in their new shared apartment, on their new shared bed.\u00a0 Wei Wuxian runs his finger in circles on his thighs, but somehow, he\u2019s still able to tell there\u2019s something wrong.\u00a0\n\u201cAre you upset none of your friends came to the housewarming\u2026?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWell, not really? It wasn\u2019t anything official. Not an actual party. There will be other opportunities for them to come visit the house? Besides, we kinda had an awesome housewarming party ourselves, here.\u201d He moves his hips a little, giving Lan Wangji\u2019s crotch a nice reminder of that.\u00a0\nHe chuckles in reply, nosing behind his ear.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m just frustrated\u2026? Literally nobody knows that we\u2019re married. The other day I overheard the new tech guy saying that you must hate my guts or something, for putting you through our \u2018bet\u2019 for as long as I did.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI still have no idea where they\u2019d get that ridiculous notion.\u201d\u00a0\nWei Wuxian hums, but then leans his head down, until it hits Lan Wangji\u2019s chest, and he can look up to see his face; \u201cAren\u2019t you upset about this? Your  brother doesn\u2019t know that you\u2019re married. He thinks I was here because we\u2019re good friends. He deserves to know you were about to fuck me in the bathtub before he said he\u2019ll drop by. I mean, not the specifics of it, obviously, but like \u2014 the fact that this is potentially what will be happening in your apartment from this day forth.\u201d\u00a0\nLan Wangji snorts, toying with fingers for a moment before interlacing them with his own.\u00a0\n\u201cI kind of like it.\u201d He says, lifting his hand up and kissing the back of it.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThe fact that we\u2019re a secret. Not because of the thrill \u2014 but more for the fact that we get to keep this just for us. It\u2019s something that belongs to the two of us, and isn\u2019t shared with nobody else. Nobody gets to pry on it, and nobody judges it.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s stupidly romantic, you know that?\u201d Wei Wuxian leans up so he could pepper some kisses on his face. \u201cI really love that.\u201d\nLan Wangji hums, and captures his cheeks so he could have one proper, deep kiss.\n\u201cI love you.\u201d Wei Wuxian adds, when they part.\n\u201cI love you, too.\u201d Lan Wangji rubs their noses together, and Wei Wuxian adores that.\u00a0\nThey\u2019re not really handsy during the day, and Wei Wuxian is okay with that. Being professional and appropriate is important to Lan Wangji, he enjoys the respect and reputation of his peers and colleagues and wouldn\u2019t want to mar it. Right now he\u2019s known as a bit too stern and cold, so if they just started making out at work, everybody\u2019s heads will probably explode.\u00a0\nThey don\u2019t know that at home, he\u2019s a huge softie, and he likes cuddling and doing super sweet gestures, and it makes up for every single bad thing that had  ever happened to Wei Wuxian.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian draws back suddenly; \u201cHey, you know where we didn\u2019t have sex yet? The laundry room. Specifically, on top of the laundry machine. While it\u2019s working. And I have  a lot of dirty laundry.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cPatience,\u201d Lan Wangji says, amused with him, his hands crawling over his waist. \u201cWe have all the time in the world.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n.\n\u00a0\nIn the autumn right before their third year of marriage, they get interns.\u00a0\nThey\u2019re both had been promoted senior associates, the company was expanding, and needed new blood.\u00a0\nThis batch of interns was actually the weirdest one yet, because it was mostly family. Two of Lan Wangji\u2019s distant cousins, who would flock around Lan Wangji like he\u2019s mother hen. And Jin Ling, Yanli\u2019s son. It was Wei Wuxian that convinced Lan Xichen to take him in (despite Jiang Cheng\u2019s efforts). He finished university over a year ago, but was just sitting on his ass and partying with his friends until dawn. Yanli was worried for his future, and frankly, Wei Wuxian knew he just needed a push.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian used to be his favorite uncle back when he was a kiddo, but nowadays, when easy money and carefree attitudes mattered most, it was Jiang Cheng, who always had a buck to spare. Which is exactly why Jiang Cheng didn\u2019t want Jin Ling working there; at work, Jiang Cheng is a ruthless son of a bitch, that would literally throw sand into an opponent\u2019s eyes to win a case. It also what made him a great lawyer; but probably the shittiest senior associate to work under, because his intern demands were extremely high. Last year, 3 of the 4 interns he got quit before the end of the internship.\u00a0\nSo despite the fact that among the seniors, Wei Wuxian was the youngest, and only got his seniorship during spring \u2014 Jiang Cheng pushed the duty on him, saying he\u2019s got too many cases to deal with brats.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s how Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji got stuck with babysitting.\nThis was sort of the perfect timing for it, too. Because they were sort of, maybe, just a tiny bit exploring the possibility of  maybe having kids.\nWei Wuxian didn\u2019t feel ready, frankly, and when Lan Wangji first started talking about it, a few months back,\u00a0 he suggested they should get bunnies first. Or a cat. You know, fluffier, smaller things, that you can\u2019t really fuck up psychologically because of your own fucked up childhood.\u00a0\nAnd Lan Wangji didn\u2019t want to push him.\nSo now they have 5 bunnies.\u00a0\nAnd zero kids.\u00a0\nBut handling the interns hadn\u2019t been that horrible. In fact, it kind of turned Wei Wuxian on, how patient Lan Wangji can be with them. He can explain the same thing even seven times, each time just a tiny bit differently so that it can be understood. Wei Wuxian thinks they\u2019ve learned more under his wing than they did back in law school.\nThey\u2019re all sent to do their errands and tasks for the day, when Wei Wuxian sits on Lan Wangji\u2019s table; \u201cYou\u2019re good at this. At this parenting thing.\u201d\u00a0\nLan Wangji is just collecting files into a pile and gives him a long look. \u201cThis isn\u2019t exactly parenting.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYes, but they\u2019re all sort of struck in awe in front of you; both out of fear and adoration. It\u2019s fascinating.\u201d\u00a0\nHe snorts and lands a kiss on his nose. \u201cIt\u2019s you they adore. I heard them say you\u2019re  cool .\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWhy do you have to make it sound like it\u2019s some sort of an insult?\u201d He wraps his hands around his neck, half-laughing. \u201cI\u2019m always cool.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI think you\u2019re hot.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cLan Wangji, are you making a pass at me?\u201d\n\u201cWhy are you making it sound so scandalous?\u201d He gives him a kiss on the lips, which Wei Wuxian is more than willing to reciprocate\u00a0 \u2014 but it\u2019s cut off by the sound of the door opening, a loud gasp, and the door slamming closed.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian doesn\u2019t even get a good looking at him \u2014 so he has no idea who it is, just that it\u2019s definitely one of the interns.\u00a0\nHe turns back to Lan Wangji, who gives him one more peck on the lips before going back to sorting some files.\u00a0\n\u201cAren\u2019t you \u2014 um \u2014 somebody just walked in?\u201d\u00a0\nLan Wangji lifts his gaze up and gives him a long look.\u00a0\n\u201cThey saw us. Making out.\u201d Wei Wuxian explains.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been married for almost 3 years now.\u201d He deadpans. \u201cFrankly, you\u2019re a bit of an exhibitionist, I\u2019m surprised that this happened only now.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOuch.\u201d Wei Wuxian laughs, cringing because he knows it\u2019s true. \u201cYeah, but... this is sort of\u2026 against the rules. Or something?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s not. I checked. There\u2019s no clause in the company\u2019s guidelines that\u2019s against employees dating or being married, as long as there\u2019s no misconduct. And the person who entered should\u2019ve knocked.\u201d\u00a0\nThey never actually had anybody really walk in on them. Wei Wuxian always thought that Lan Wangji wouldn\u2019t want that, but they weren\u2019t exactly being deliberately careful or anything. He never actually considered that he wouldn\u2019t care, if it did happen. They also never had people who were actively in and out of their rooms, constantly following their every move, either.\n\u201cI was under the impression you liked this being a secret.\u201d\u00a0\nHe considers that for a moment, then says; \u201cWhen it comes to you I don\u2019t want to force anything. Things just happen. I got used to it by now. Besides, I don\u2019t mind if others know about our marriage.\u201d\n\u201cSo \u2014 this is fine?\u201d\u00a0\nHe sighs, and draws him closer by the hand for another quick kiss; \u201cYes, this is fine.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n.\n\u00a0\nWei Wuxian sort of forgets all about it, until after lunch.\nLan Sizhui is finished with all his tasks way before the others.\u00a0\nHe\u2019s definitely one of the more capable of the interns, and isn\u2019t afraid to work hard to earn his spot at the firm. Wei Wuxian tries his very best not to have favorites among the interns \u2014 but he did notice that Lan Wangji has been doting on him more than on the others, and he understands why. He\u2019s exactly how he\u2019d picture a younger Lan Wangji, perhaps a bit friendlier \u2014 which is why he\u2019s so exceptionally fond of him.\nWei Wuxian dismisses him to go finish the research on the case he\u2019s been working with Lan Wangji, but he lingers.\nHe looks up from the papers Sizhui handed him; \u201cIs there something else?\u201d\u00a0\nHe swallows thickly, before finally blurting out; \u201cDid you and Lan Wangji have a fight?\u201d\nWei Wuxian rubs his head. He\u2019s about to say \u2018no\u2019, but Sizhui continues before he can; \u201cBecause \u2014\u201d He pauses as if he needs a moment to collect himself; \u201cWe\u2019re totally cool with it. I mean \u2014 it\u2019s not like it\u2019s a big deal. You really shouldn\u2019t worry about us. We won\u2019t tell anybody else.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWe?\u201d Wei Wuxian snorts. Well, it\u2019s to be expected. They\u2019re all fresh of college and this is probably the most exciting thing that happened on their job. All they have to do is file paper work and research boring topics, and here are two of their managers, making out.\n\u201cI promised not to tell.\u201d He looks down. \u201cWhose the one who walked in. It wasn\u2019t me, but I made everybody swear that they won\u2019t tell anybody.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine. You don\u2019t have to do that. You can literally scream it on top of your lungs right in the middle of office.\u201d He goes back to his papers; \u201cWho knows, maybe they\u2019ll believe it, if it comes from you.\u201d He adds, though more to himself.\u00a0\n\u201cSo \u2014 you are? Fighting, I mean.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re not fighting. I mean, unless it\u2019s a slang for\u2014\u201d Sizhui colors immediately. \u201cWhy would you think we had a fight?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cBefore lunch, when we settled to go over the paperwork, you two seemed \u2014 contrary.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOh\u2026 that.\u201d Wei Wuxian snorts, and waves his hand; \u201cWe have our professional differences.\u201d He admits; \u201cWe\u2019re lawyers, dude. If we agreed on everything and didn\u2019t stand on our ground about it, then we\u2019d be out of jobs. It\u2019s natural.\u201d\u00a0\nHe looks immediately relieved.\u00a0\n\u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t worry about that, okay? And that goes for all of you \u2014 this isn\u2019t a big deal. We\u2019re not going to hold it against you \u2014 any of you.\u201d He ruffles his hair. \u201cYou can go home earlier because you finished all your tasks, and we\u2019re hella proud of you.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d He nods, and takes his leave, clearly cheered up.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n.\n\u00a0\nWei Wuxian kind of considers that the end of it, except it totally isn\u2019t.\u00a0\nOn monday, just like every other Monday, one of the secretaries makes her way to Lan Wangji when he\u2019s not at his room, but in the shared space of the office, and asks him - very loudly - what he did over the weekend. When he says not much, she asks him if he had a hot date.\u00a0\nThey actually did have a date; well, kinda. They reserved a place in the new restaurant that was opened down the street from their apartment, but they ended up not going, because Lan Wangji did that thing when he wears a black button-up and folds his sleeves. Gets Wei Wuxian going every single time. It\u2019s just that he\u2019s always wearing white or baby blue shirt to work \u2014 so when it\u2019s black, it always shakes Wei Wuxian to the core.\u00a0\nThen they ordered thai and watched re-runs of some crappy sci-fi show. Perfect date night.\nAnd Lan Wangji is about to answer her that he did have a hot date, with his husband, because that\u2019s usually what he answers all the time, but before he can, Ouyang Zizhen, the one intern that wasn\u2019t related to anybody in the office, speaks just as loudly; \u201cShould you be asking this of your senior and superior? Lan Wangji didn\u2019t finish his PhD in law to get asked about his love life at work.\u201d\u00a0\nThe secretary furrows his eyebrows, and Zizhen hugs his paper to himself. They\u2019re roughly around the same age, but he does come off as exceptionally rude and condescending, even though Wei Wuxian considered him quite the meek type; \u201cThis sort of talk is unprofessional at work, and we have enough work to tend to.\u201d He adds.\u00a0\nLan Wangji nods absently, and goes back to reviewing the paper he was reviewing before.\u00a0\nLater, during lunch in the cafeteria, Lan Xichen says that he\u2019d love it if Lan Wangji would be less-work oriented, and maybe start a family, and Lan Jingyi tells him to \u201cStop being so nosy.\u201d and \u201cIf you want a bunch of wailing, pooping babies, you can have your own and leave Lan Wangji out of it.\u201d\u00a0\nNeedless to say Lan Xichen takes it well, beacon of grace and manners, but he does get a weird tick in his eye.\u00a0\u00a0\nWei Wuxian doesn\u2019t think much about it, until he\u2019s going over some case files with the interns before he\u2019s about to dismiss them, and Jiang Cheng comes along, without knocking, and drops a huge pile of paper on Wei Wuxian\u2019s desk.\u00a0\n\u201cI need those by tomorrow, and I\u2019m swamped.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI literally saw you playing angry birds at your desk this morning. You could\u2019ve started on those then.\u201d Wei Wuxian scolds, rummaging through the files. It\u2019ll take him all night. He could potentially give this to the interns \u2014 he knows they\u2019re probably exhausted as it is. And technically this is a case he\u2019s been working with Jiang Cheng and kind of neglected since he started babysitting the interns.\n\u201cYou know that\u2019s a part of my morning ritual.\u201d Jiang Cheng says; \u201cIf I don\u2019t kill some piggies, I won\u2019t be able to do well in court.\u201d\u00a0\nWei Wuxian gives him a long look; \u201cNo, you do that because you drink your coffee while playing, and you have to poop by 9, because that\u2019s when the hearings start. And playing while drinking coffee is before-you-poop ritual.\u201d\u00a0\nLan Jingyi sniggers, and Jiang Cheng sharply turns to him, which makes him straighten and pretend he didn\u2019t even blink.\u00a0\nJiang Cheng clears his throat. \u201cYeah, well, you\u2019re adopted.\u201d Is his brilliant comeback. Always hits right on the spot.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian takes a long inhale; \u201cFine. Just go. We still need to go over some of the research.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cUncle, is there nobody else that can do this instead of Uncle Wei Wuxian?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cJin Ling, I told you not to refer to me as uncle at work.\u201d Jiang Cheng reminds. \u201cHere, I\u2019m your superior.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYes \u2014 but still. Uncle Wei might have stuff he needs to do later, at home.\u201d Jin Ling insists. \u201cStuff that you\u2019re clearly not going to do.\u201d\nJiang Cheng furrows his eyebrows; \u201cWhat sort of stuff?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cAll sorts of stuff! You can\u2019t just land paperwork on somebody like that. And I know you\u2019re definitely not busy after work, and it is  your paperwork.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s alright, Jin Ling.\u201d Wei Wuxian says, trying to settle down the dispute. \u201cI\u2019ve handled worse.\u201d\n\u201cI can be busy, too.\u201d Jiang Cheng raises his voice slightly. \u201cI do all sort of stuff at home. I have a life, too, you know?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cUncle,  please , you\u2019re so single you thought barebacking is a kind of sport.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it \u2014?\u201d He turns to Wei Wuxian to ask this, who shakes his head slowly, cringing that his nephew knows the term while his step-brother doesn\u2019t. \u201cWhat is it then? What else do you do with a bare back?\u201d\n\u201cOkay, how about we all just calm down\u2014\u201d Wei Wuxian raises his hands.\u00a0\n\u201cPoint is you\u2019re being totally inconsiderate toward Uncle Wei \u2014\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cJin Ling\u2014\u201d\u00a0\n\u201c-- because he\u2019s dating someone and you\u2019re not, and you and everybody in the office are complete assholes about it, too, and \u2014\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWho the hell is he dating?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cLan Wangji!\u201d Jin Ling explodes. Yeah, he was never one to keep a secret, anyway. Not that it was a secret.\u00a0\n\u201cJin Ling!\u201d Sizhui scolds, and Jin Ling settles finally, giving Wei Wuxian a long apologetic look.\u00a0\n\u201cOh man, for a second there.\u201d Jiang Cheng snorts;\u00a0 \u201cStop fooling around with the interns \u2014 and teach them how to do some\u2026  lawyering .\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019ll teach them. Lawyering. Because that\u2019s a word.\u201d\u00a0\nJiang Cheng stops at the door, then bursts into laughter, shaking his head, before going out of the door.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian rolls his eyes, but when he turns back to the interns, they are all sitting there, quite clearly upset. Jin Ling looks furious.\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, what is going on?\u201d\u00a0\nThey all start speaking over each other.\u00a0\n\u201cEverybody in this office are a bunch of cumbuckets, that\u2019s what!\u201d Lan Jingyi jumps up.\n\u201cWhy are you letting them step over you? This is clearly homophobic behaviour!\u201d Ouyang Zizhen continues.\u00a0\n\u201cI checked \u2014 and there\u2019s no rule against couples at work. I went through all the guidelines, so if you\u2019re keeping this secret because of that there\u2019s no reason to worry about it!\u201d Lan Sizhui helps.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m going to tell mom that Uncle is being a total cunt about this, you just wait \u2014\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, enough!\u201d He holds his hand up, and they all quiet down. \u201cJin Ling, your mom knows \u2014 I\u2019ve told her many, many times. She thinks I\u2019m just trying to reassure her that I\u2019m not lonely \u2014 or something along the lines. And we know about the rules thing,\u201d He turns to Sizhui briefly before moving to Jingyi; \u201cAnd you can\u2019t talk like that to your superiors. At least not to their face, okay? Lan Xichen was about to have an aneurysm in the cafeteria.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWell, but they are.\u201d Jingyi insists.\u00a0\nFinally he turns to Zizhen; \u201cLook, you guys. Me and Lan Wangji aren\u2019t trying to hide ourselves and nor are we letting people step on us. They\u2019re not trying to bully us. They just \u2014 don\u2019t seem to realize that this is real.\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019re \u2014 hooked up? Officially?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nWei Wuxian snorts; \u201cOh, we\u2019re hooked up, alright. We\u2019ve been married for three years, now.\u201d\u00a0 Wei Wuxian shows them his ring finger, right on the inside of the finger \u2014 there\u2019s a tiny tattoo of a blue-ish white cloud, along with Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian initials, and the day they they got married in roman numerals. You can\u2019t really see it, unless you\u2019re looking for it, and it\u2019s small and concealed, but it means the world to him.\u00a0\nLan Wangji has the same \u2014 except his is in a red circle.\u00a0\nIt seemed more fitting than a ring. A ring can be lost \u2014 and Wei Wuxian totally lost the ring Lan Wangji bought him that day they got drunk. Lan Wangji was kind of upset about it too, so Wei Wuxian suggested getting a tattoo, instead. Because a tattoo is forever. And Lan Wangji agreed.\nAll four of the interns look like this is the best thing to happen since pumpkin pie was invented.\u00a0\n\u201cAnd guys, we\u2019re perfectly fine the way we are right now. We love our job, and we keep our private lives \u2014  well , private. So just focus on your work and don\u2019t let it bother you.\u201d\u00a0\nThey all nod absently, wide-eyed and dazzled expressions on their faces, but sit back and let Wei Wuxian finish what they started.\u00a0\n\n\n\n.\n\u00a0\nNext week already goes awry when Lan Wangji texts him that he got assigned with an external case. It\u2019s a municipality contract, and he won\u2019t be at the office as much.\u00a0\nWithout Lan Wangji ordering them around, the interns have too much free time on their hands.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian prefers not to give them needless tasks, either, and Lan Sizhui already wordlessly brings him his coffee, just how he likes it, so he can\u2019t even send them out to get coffee.\u00a0\nMostly, they\u2019re just scratching their balls and playing PUBG on their phones while he\u2019s trying to work.\u00a0\nOn tuesday, there\u2019s a large bouquet of flowers in the trash, and when Wei Wuxian makes note of it, Jin Ling hides it with his body, hands crossed on his chest.\u00a0\nThere\u2019s another bouquet the next day, but Jingyi claims it was from Sizhui, and that an older office lady wanted to get into his pants. Wei Wuxian doubts that, but lets it go.\nThey\u2019re all huddling up together in corners, serious faces and wild hand gestures, and whenever Wei Wuxian asks what\u2019s going on, there\u2019s always a new excuse.\u00a0\nOn thursday, Jingyi and Zizhuan are sitting in Wei Wuxian\u2019s office in the midst of what seems to be a serious chocolate binge, when he comes in, mouths stuffed. He\u2019s forced to send them home because they have stomach aches.\nWhen friday finally comes around, he and Lan Wangji are sitting in his room, having lunch together, for what seems to be the first time in a week, when he notices that Lan Wangji keeps looking at his watch and his phone, as if he\u2019s waiting for a call or a text.\nWhen he lifts his head up to meet his eyes again, he finally says; \u201cDelivery companies are incompetant.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you having delivered?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cFlowers.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cTo whom?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cTo you.\u201d\u00a0\nWei Wuxian smiles; \u201cIs this because our anniversary is coming up\u2026? You know I hate flowers.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI know.\u201d He says; \u201cBut the point is that they had a big chocolate bunny between the flowers.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cAh, yes. Speaking to me through my stomach, you\u2019re truly the man of my dreams.\u201d Wei Wuxian grins. \u201cI\u2019ve also prepared you a gift. But you\u2019ll get to unwrap it on the day of the anniversary. In bed.\u201d\u00a0\nLan Wangji looks slightly perked up about that, but then he glances at his phone again, and looks troubled; \u201cI\u2019ve been wrapped up in this case \u2014 so I\u2019m barely home. So I\u2019ve been trying to send you gifts for a week now. But you haven\u2019t gotten any of them, otherwise you would\u2019ve said something. I even sent a whole chocolate-bunny bouquet the other day.\u201d Lan Wangji stops talking, because they hear some loud noises from outside.\u00a0\nBut Wei Wuxian bursts into a short laughter, and covers his face with one of his hands, leaning his head back onto his chair; \u201cAnd let me guess, you didn\u2019t sign your name on any of these.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYes, they were anonymous \u2014 but because of the bunny, I thought you\u2019d be able to tell\u2014 \u201d There\u2019s the sound of furniture moving, and a few gasps, so Lan Wangji furrows his eyebrows, wondering what\u2019s happening outside. The door of Wei Wuxian\u2019s office is closed, so there\u2019s not much to see.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cI would\u2019ve \u2014 but I never got any of that. The interns must have thought somebody that isn\u2019t you  is sending me flowers and chocolates. They\u2019re \u2014 all\u2026 weirdly pressed about the two of us. The other day I saw Jin Ling giving Jiang Cheng a whole lecture about accepting homosexuallity into his heart and \u2014\u201d\u00a0\nThere\u2019s mild chatter from outside again, but Lan Wangji can\u2019t take it anymore, and stands up to see what\u2019s the rackus all about.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian follows him, naturally curious.\u00a0\nRight outside there\u2019s a delivery guy, looking worse for wear. Lan Jingyi is on the floor, holding onto his legs. Lan Sizhui and Jin Ling are coming up right behind him, but halt when they see Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji at the door, both red from running.\u00a0\nOuyang Zizhen attempts, albeit futilely, to hide the delivery guy, by starfishing in front of him.\u00a0\nThe common office space is filled with curious faces, and all the secretaries went out of the break room to see what\u2019s happening.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian plucks out the chocolate bunny out of the flower bouquet the delivery guy was holding (some of the flowers were all rumpled and broken), and starts unwrapping it; \u201cNothing to see here! Just marriage-related business!\u201d he says loudly before turning to Lan Wangji and announcing; \u201cIs now a good time to mention that I\u2019ve totally changed my mind about having kids?\u201d"
