Seriously, top tier Good Dad!Bruce content right there.</p>\n<p>This fic was definitely inspired by both of those stories, but I've done my best to put my own spin on things, so I'm really looking forward to adding another cake to the party!

Then I ultimately decided the line was stupid and cut it. This is writing in a nutshell \ud83d\ude43</p>\n<p>I'm posting this chapter a couple days early because I'll be busy the next few days with holiday stuff. Merry Christmas to all who celebrate!! And a wonderful Saturday to those who don't \ud83d\udc9a</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_4_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>The NyQuil bit was taken directly from my friend's experience growing up, except her parents only did it for long car rides. They'd pile all the kids in the backseat, then give them each a shot of \"Traveling Juice\" before taking off. They'd sleep through the ride with minimal squabbling and wake up at their destination.</p>\n<p>She just thought everyone did this with their kids. It wasn't until she was in college and got a cold and tried NyQuil for the \"first time\" that she realized what <em> Traveling Juice </em> was all along \ud83d\ude2c<br>---</p>\n<p><b>EDIT:</b> I've gotten quite a few comments wondering how the Drakes' landline phone could have worked during a power outage, so I just wanted to take a second to address that!</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/question62.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">How Stuff Works</a>, it takes very little power to complete a phone call (only about 6-12 volts at about 30 milliamps). Depending on your phone service provider, it's quite common for them to have backup generators which can supply enough power through the underground copper telephone wires\u2014separate from the main power line\u2014to complete a call, provided that the telephone is a <em>corded</em> device. Wireless devices will not work without power (or, if they use a rechargeable battery, at least will not work for very long).</p>\n<p>Now I certainly can't speak for <em>every</em> phone company, but this was true of the one that serviced my family growing up, so hopefully that shows it's at least <em>plausible</em> that the Drakes' phone could have worked during a power outage? So in this one instance, Janet <em>does</em> actually have a point and isn't just being a bitch (though arguments could certainly be made about how the heck she expects Tim to carry out her instructions while tethered via a 10 foot spiral cord to the kitchen wall)</p>\n<p><b>EDIT #2 (because this line will truly be the death of me)</b> : Okay, apparently all of the above information WAS true, up until the last decade or so when the majority of phone providers switched over to VoIP. This means you have to have an internet connection in order to place a landline call, which you can't have without power to the router, so modern landlines are useless in a power outage. Janet still believes what she believes from her own childhood experiences. Whether she's right and Tim could have used the hardwired phone, or whether Gotham has modernized their landline technology yet is up for interpretation. I could definitely see the city opting out, since their power grid goes down like every other week with the latest rogue attack lmao</p>\n<p>[content warning: somewhat graphic description of injury/blood]</p>\n<p>[Content warning: graphic descriptions of blood, injury, wounds, and serious illness.

    "text": "Tim is good at galas.\u00a0\nNo, scratch that\u2014Tim is  great  at galas. He\u2019s been attending them ever since the age of three, when his parents first stuffed him into his little Gymboree tuxedo and gave him a stern lecture about \u2018sitting quietly\u2019 and \u2018speaking when spoken to.\u2019 He knows all the rules: what to wear, how to stand, when to smile, what to say, what  not to say. He knows how to come across as polite and intelligent and charming, and on absolutely any other day, he would be rocking this.\n\n \u201cTimothy.\u201d\u00a0 \n\nHe startles at the sound of his mother\u2019s voice. She\u2019s standing behind him, her dangly earrings brushing against his suit collar as she leans in close to hiss reprovingly in his ear. \u201cStop.  Yawning.\u201d \n\u201cSorry,\u201d Tim whispers, even as his body chooses that moment to betray him. He attempts to let the yawn out subtly by keeping his mouth closed and flaring his nostrils, but Janet still glares at him. \u201cSorry,\u201d he says again, sheepish. \u201cI\u2019ll stop. I swear.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d better. You\u2019re\u2013\u201d\nBoth she and Tim turn their heads and paste back on their best Gala Smiles\u2122 to warmly greet the mayor\u2019s wife as she approaches. There\u2019s a brief conversation in which Tim gets his cheeks pinched and is told how big he\u2019s getting (\u201cTwelve years old already, Timothy? My goodness, how time flies!\u201d). Then she and Janet chat about the upcoming town council meeting for a few minutes while Tim just stands there, a practiced smile serenely plastered on his face while he internally re-examines his life choices.\u00a0\nOkay, so in hindsight, he probably shouldn\u2019t have gone out last night.\nReally, if he\u2019s being honest with himself, he shouldn\u2019t be going out  any  night. Downtown Gotham is a sketchy place for an unaccompanied minor in even the broadest of daylight; it\u2019s downright  treacherous  after dark. But Tim\u2019s long-since accepted the risks of his nighttime escapades.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s worth it for a chance to see the Bats in action.\nSneaking out hadn\u2019t been the problem\u2014he perfected the art of silently unlocking his bedroom window and shimmying down the trellis years ago, and even when his parents are home, it\u2019s not like they ever bother to check in on him during the night. There are a few security cameras scattered across the Drake property grounds, but they\u2019re all easily avoided if you know where to walk, and Tim could do it in his sleep.\u00a0\nThe bus driver didn\u2019t so much as blink at Tim when he\u2019d taken the 148 into the city, and he\u2019d kept his head down as he walked the two blocks to a nearby apartment complex where he knew a specific dumpster was positioned near enough to the fire escape to allow him access to the roof. It had been a 7-E-Delta night\u2014or at least that\u2019s what Tim refers to it as. The Bats have twelve distinct patrolling routes, each of them with five alternating starting times and six different points of entry, which they rotate through in a complicated pattern every few weeks to keep the Rogues on their toes. Tim wrote an algorithm to crack their system when he was ten, but he\u2019s always been a bit obsessive like that whenever there\u2019s a puzzle to solve.\n(It\u2019s the same reason his parents refuse to watch Criminal Minds episodes with him anymore.)\nThe evening hadn\u2019t been particularly eventful. Tim kept to the shadows like always, moving silently from one fire escape to another and utilizing his camera\u2019s high-resolution lenses to stay safely removed from the action. He\u2019d snapped pictures of Batman and Robin perching on rooftops, swinging from grapple lines, and supporting an up-and-coming local business by purchasing several rather overpriced falafel wraps.\nAll of that had been totally fine.\u00a0\nThe trouble had come at around two a.m, just as Tim was getting ready to pack up his camera and call it a night so that he could make the last bus back to Bristol. That\u2019s when a few sketchy characters stumbling out of a nearby bar just so happened to commandeer the exact alleyway that Tim was perched above to have an all-out brawl, which quickly escalated from fists, to smashed liquor bottles, to switchblades.\u00a0\nThen, when some certain caped vigilantes swooped in to break it up, one of the drunks pulled a gun and things got  really interesting.\nThe good news is that Tim both managed to avoid getting shot and  to take some epically close-range photos of Batman and Robin kicking ass.\u00a0\n...Which was almost awesome enough to make up for the twelve mile hike back to Bristol after he missed his bus.\u00a0\nIt was 5:45 in the morning by the time he finally hauled himself back up the trellis and in through the window\u2014just in time to crash into bed before his alarm went off for school at 6:30.\n(Oh well. You win some, you lose some.)\nThe moment the mayor\u2019s wife bids her farewell and moves on to greet the next little cluster of attendees, Janet turns back to Tim.\n\u201cYou are making a  scene,\u201d  she continues in a low voice, as if they hadn\u2019t been interrupted at all. \u201cElaina McBurry said she caught you nodding off during Mr. Wayne\u2019s opening address. She even asked me if you were ill.\u201d\nJanet sounds so appalled by the idea that she might bring her son out in public while at anything less than his best that Tim nearly snorts aloud at the irony. Just last month, he\u2019d emailed his parents during their dig in Tibet to request they call him out of school for a fever and sore throat, and they\u2019d advised him to \u2018try and push through.\u2019\n(It was strep. He found out two days later when Mrs. Mac had to come pick him up from the nurse\u2019s office after he\u2019d fainted during a biology lab.)\n\u201cI\u2019m just tired,\u201d Tim says truthfully. It\u2019s going on hour five of the annual Martha Wayne Foundation Charity Ball and it\u2019s taking every ounce of self-control for him to keep his eyelids open.\u00a0\nIt wouldn\u2019t be so bad if only Tim had been able to snag his usual after-school power nap, but his parents have an early flight to Honduras tomorrow morning, so they needed his help prepping the equipment and hauling out suitcases. Before Tim knew it, it was time to start getting dressed for the gala.\nBut it\u2019s fine. Really. He can do this. Sure, he also hadn\u2019t really slept much  two  nights ago (insomnia), and had gotten to bed kind of late  three  nights ago (history paper deadline), but he\u2019s fine. He\u2019ll be fine.\n\u201cHow much longer do you think it\u2019ll be?\u201d he asks quietly.\u00a0\n\u201cWell that entirely depends on when your father is able to close his deal with the Drummonds,\u201d Janet replies, glancing over to where Jack is chatting amicably with a small group of businessmen across the ballroom. Her irritation seems to shift along with her gaze, from her son to her husband. \u201cI told him to just make his offer hours ago, but he insists he\u2019s \u2018playing the long game\u2019 over there. Last time I checked in, they were scheduling a golf outing...\u201d\nSo, another hour at least. Great. Not like it\u2019s eleven p.m. and Tim\u2019s running on less than an hour of sleep or anything.\n\u201cFor god\u2019s sake, Timothy,\u201d Janet says when he attempts another one-nostril yawn. His mother\u2019s eyes dart around the room. \u201cPeople are starting to stare.\u201d\nTim barely suppresses the urge to roll his eyes. No one\u2014honestly  no one \u2014is looking at them right now, but he knows from experience that pointing out that fact will only make his mother more annoyed with him.\n(It\u2019s kind of funny, really. Under any other circumstance, Tim would kill for this much attention from his parents.)\n\u201cGo to the restroom and splash some water on your face,\u201d she orders, giving him a little nudge toward the door. \u201cThen ask the waitstaff for something with caffeine. I don\u2019t want to see you back in public until you can control yourself.\u201d\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d Tim nods immediately, but Janet\u2019s already turned away and plastered back on her Gala Smile\u2122 to greet a woman wearing more pearls than an oyster bed.\nThe sounds of the gala grow muffled in the background as Tim slips out of the ballroom and into the hall. He has no actual intention of splashing water on his face\u2014it\u2019ll ruin the concealer he\u2019s wearing to hide the frankly horrendous dark circles under his eyes\u2014but he\u2019s not about to turn down his mother\u2019s explicit permission to take a break.\nThere are two guest powder rooms just off the reception hall. Tim tries the doors, but finds both of them currently in use. Sighing, he leans his back against the wall, arms crossed over his chest, and waits.\nA few seconds later, he finds himself shooting his head back up with an involuntary snort after feeling it drop to his chest.\n God. He\u2019s so tired he could cry.\u00a0\nHe won\u2019t, that\u2019s stupid. He\u2019s not a toddler. Not that his parents would have ever let him cry at a formal event as a toddler either\u2014he\u2019d have been shipped back to the nanny so fast he\u2019d have whiplash.\u00a0\nHuh. He wonders how Ms. Sophie is doing these days. She was always his favorite of the rotating cast of childcare workers his parents hired over the years, so it had been a real shame when she\u2019d gotten engaged and moved to Montana. If he closes his eyes, he can still smell that lily of the valley perfume she always wore...\nTim feels his head drop and jerks it up again, blinking. Focus, Tim. He taps his cheeks a few times, trying fruitlessly to wake himself up.\u00a0\nMaybe he should just walk home? It\u2019s only about a mile from Wayne Manor to the Drake Estate\u2014child\u2019s play compared to his trek back from the city last night. He can shoot his parents a text once he\u2019s on his way home so they know not to look for him. They\u2019ll no doubt be pissed at him for abandoning the party, but hey, they\u2019re pissed at him anyway and at least this way he\u2019ll get some sleep out of it.\nLeaving through the main entrance is out of the question; there are far too many guests milling about there and he\u2019ll certainly be noticed. But Tim\u2019s spent... well, kind of an  embarrassing amount of time staring at\u2014(and daydreaming about, and discreetly photographing the exterior of)\u2014Wayne Manor over the years, so he knows that there\u2019s a sunny library toward the southeast corner of the building with massive windows and sliding glass doors that lead right out to the grounds.\u00a0\nIf Tim can just get  there,  he\u2019s golden.\nHis mind made up, Tim takes a breath and pushes himself away from the wall, moving quietly but determinedly down the corridor. He passes by an elegant parlor with ten or so guests sitting around chatting, and then an industrial-sized kitchen buzzing with catering staff, but no one pays the twelve-year-old any mind. He slips past them easily, but halts when he turns a corner to find a velvet rope blocking off the next hall.\n End of the public wing, his groggy brain supplies. And if Tim were any more awake at the moment, he might have thought twice about ducking under the rope and continuing on into the private wing of Bruce Wayne\u2019s mansion. But as it is, there\u2019s only one thought on Timothy Drake\u2019s mind, and that is that if he succeeds in this mission, it ends with him crashing into his  glorious, wonderful, soft, inviting bed and that alone is enough to spur him onward.\nHe walks by another sitting room\u2014much cozier looking than the public one\u2014then past a few impressive suits of armor, and then suddenly, he sees it: a spacious, bookcase-lined room with floor to ceiling windows and a sliding glass door that will be Tim\u2019s ticket home.\u00a0\nA tired grin spreads across his face as he steps inside.\n...Right before he sees the night sky light up with a flash of lightning, followed a split-second later by the crack of thunder.\nShit.\nIt\u2019s pouring rain outside.\nTim\u2019s parents  might be willing to overlook him dipping out of the gala early, but there is no way in hell they\u2019re going to overlook him ruining an eight hundred dollar tuxedo and brand new Oxford shoes after he jogs a mile across the muddy grounds.\n\u201cUuuughhhh...\u201d Tim lets out a groan, balling his hands up and pressing them against his eyes in frustration. That\u2019s it. He\u2019s going to be stuck here until his dad closes that stupid deal. He really could cry.\nThe combination of Tim\u2019s exhaustion and his current theatrics are starting to make his head rush, so he sinks down, for just a moment, into a nearby armchair. It\u2019s plush and overstuffed and envelops him instantly. Why don\u2019t they have chairs like this at his house? Most of the furniture at the Drakes\u2019 home is stiff and uncomfortable, better suited for show than actual use.\u00a0\nBut this chair? This chair is  heavenly. \nHe\u2019ll just stay for a minute or two\u2014rest his eyes and catch his breath before making his way back to the ballroom. Maybe if he asks really nicely, one of the waiters will give him an espresso. Though,  ugh,  he\u2019s so overtired that just the thought of drinking something that bitter right now makes him want to puke.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s fine though. Tim will be fine. Just after he rests for a minute...\n\u201cWhoa! Who the fuck are you?\u201d\nTim wakes with a start, his eyes snapping open at the exclamation to reveal sunlight streaming in through the massive windows of the Wayne family library. In front of him stands a teenage boy dressed in an oversized red hoodie and Wonder Woman pajama pants. He looks at least as surprised to see Tim as Tim is to see him.\n Holy shit, that\u2019s Jason Todd,  Tim\u2019s mind supplies.  That\u2019s Robin. \n\u201cUhh...\u201d Tim\u2019s brain is short-circuiting. He twists around in his seat and scrubs quickly at the little puddle of drool he\u2019d left on the armchair. God, this is embarrassing.\n\u201cHey B?\u201d Jason calls over his shoulder, eyes still locked on Tim. \u201cIs there something you wanna tell me?\u201d\n\u201cLike what, Jaybird?\u201d And just like that, Bruce Wayne, wearing a plaid robe and honest-to-god fuzzy slippers, appears in the doorway. There\u2019s a rolled-up newspaper tucked under his arm and a steaming mug in his hand with the words \u2018World\u2019s Best Cat-sitter\u2019 scrawled across the front. He blinks at Tim.\nTim blinks back.\n\u201cI see.\u201d Bruce clears his throat, then turns his head over his shoulder. \u201cHey Alfred?\u201d he calls calmly down the hall. \u201cWere you aware we\u2019d acquired another child?\u201d\n \u201cNo, Master Bruce, but I shall set out another plate post-haste,\u201d  a prim British voice replies from what sounds like a room or two away.\n\u201cThank you, Alfred.\u201d\n\n \u201cMy pleasure, sir.\u201d \n\nFinally, Tim finds his tongue. \u201cOh my goodness, I\u2019m so sorry, Mr. Wayne,\u201d he blurts out, scrambling up from the armchair to his feet. \u201cI was here for the gala and I just\u2013 I- I got a bit lost looking for the bathroom and I wandered in here! I only meant to sit down for a minute but I must\u2019ve fallen asleep! I\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019ll leave right now!\u201d\n\u201cHey, hey calm down, dude,\u201d Jason says with a little laugh, holding his hands up in front of his chest in a non-threatening gesture. \u201cYou\u2019re fine\u2014no one\u2019s mad at you. You just surprised me, that\u2019s all. I came in here to grab my book, and lo and behold, I find out B went ahead and replaced me with the newer model while I was sleeping.\u201d\n \u201cJason,\u201d  Bruce chides, giving him a stern look. \u201cDon\u2019t even joke about that.\u201d\nJason snorts. \u201cWhat? He\u2019s got black hair and blue eyes and\u2013 ow!\u201d he yelps when Bruce reaches over and flicks him right in the center of his forehead. He rubs the spot with a scowl. \u201cRude,\u201d he mutters, which only makes Bruce smirk.\nTurning back to Tim, Bruce switches the mug to his left hand so that he can extend his right. \u201cI don\u2019t believe we had the pleasure of meeting last night. Bruce Wayne,\u201d he offers as if it were even  possible  for Tim not to know that.\n\u201cTimothy Drake,\u201d Tim replies in a daze, shaking the hand on reflex more than anything. It\u2019s somehow both warmer and rougher than he\u2019d expected. \u201cUh, but I just go by Tim. I live next door,\u201d he adds hastily.\n\u201cWait, the Drakes? \u201d Jason interrupts, brow furrowed. \u201cDidn\u2019t your parents leave at like, midnight last night? With that Drummond guy?\u201d\n\u201cAnd how would you know that, Jay?\u201d Bruce asks, looking at his son in amusement. \u201cYou told me you had a stomach ache and went up to bed as soon as dinner was over.\u201d\nJason snorts humorously. \u201cI just didn\u2019t want to hear any more of your boring speeches, old man. I keep telling you, you need better material.\u201d He jerks a thumb sideways at Tim. \u201cEven Timmy here was nodding off during your welcome address.\u201d\n\u201cNo I wasn\u2019t!\u201d Tim feels his cheeks flush. If his mother had been ready to rip him a new one over nosy old Mrs. McBurry catching him, he doesn\u2019t even want to  imagine  what she\u2019d say now. \u201cI thought your speech was really interesting, Mr. Wayne,\u201d he says quickly. \u201cEspecially the parts about, uh, charity, and giving back to the community, and uh...\u201d\nBruce chuckles, making a placating gesture with his free hand. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, Tim. I\u2019ll admit, it wasn\u2019t my best.\u201d\n\u201cYou should let me and Dick write the next one for you,\u201d Jason offers. \u201cI\u2019m sure we can spice things up.\u201d\n\u201cThanks, but I\u2019d kind of like to keep my position on the board of directors,\u201d Bruce says in a deadpan.\nJason clutches his chest, letting out a little gasp of mock offense. \u201cYou wound me, B.\u201d\nBruce takes a sip of his coffee, his expression impassive. \u201cYou\u2019ll get over it.\u201d\n\u201cUm\u2013\u201d Tim side-steps awkwardly around the coffee table. \u201cI think I\u2019d best be getting home now. I\u2019m so sorry again for the trouble.\u201d\nJason\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cOh shit, that\u2019s right. Your parents are probably worried sick.\u201d He pulls his phone out of his hoodie pocket. \u201cHere, you can call them if you want.\u201d\nAt the mention of his parents, cold dread pools in Tim\u2019s stomach. Worried sick he highly doubts, but  livid? Now, livid is a definite possibility.\n\u201cOh, no thank you, I have my own,\u201d Tim declines, reaching into his jacket\u2019s interior pocket. His phone has been on silent all night, so he mentally braces himself as he pulls it out for the barrage of furious missed texts and calls he\u2019s sure to have from\u2013\nOh.\nApart from a couple of mobile game notifications and the clock displaying \u201810:37 a.m,\u2019 Tim\u2019s lock screen is completely empty.\nSo. They didn\u2019t even notice they\u2019d left without him.\nWhich... Which is fine! Tim is  fine.  Sure, his parents might\u2019ve  sorta kinda accidentally  forgotten about him, but that\u2019s just because they\u2019re not used to dragging a kid around all the time\u2014it\u2019s an easy mistake to make! And it\u2019s not like it\u2019s a long walk back home or anything. Hell, it\u2019s actually  better  for Tim this way because it means his parents are probably still sleeping off last night\u2019s indulgences, so if he\u2019s lucky, he might even be able to scale back up the trellis and in through his window before they wake up to realize\u2013\nBruce clears his throat. \u201cUh, forgive me if I\u2019m mistaken, Tim,\u201d he begins carefully, \u201cbut I spoke with your father last night at the gala, and I believe he mentioned something about an early morning flight to Honduras...?\u201d\nTim freezes, his thumb still hovering over the phone screen.\u00a0\nHe blinks.  No. There\u2019s no way they\u2013\nIt\u2019s one thing to have forgot they brought him to a party, but there\u2019s  no way  they would have up and left for  Honduras  without even\u2013\n\u201cUh... Tim?\u201d Jason says slowly. \u201cAre you supposed to be on a plane right now?\u201d\nThat\u2019s enough to snap Tim out of it. \u201cWhat? Oh, no, I\u2019m not,\u201d he says quickly, shaking his head to clear it. \u201cIt\u2019s just a business trip. The plan was always for me to stay home. It\u2019s just that I thought...\u201d\u00a0\nHe trails off, watching Bruce and Jason\u2019s concerned faces.\u00a0\n\n Focus, Tim. \n\nHe shakes his head again, forcing out a small laugh. \u201cI think there was just a minor miscommunication about how I was getting home last night, that\u2019s all,\u201d he finishes, flashing his best Gala Smile\u2122 for good measure.\nJason\u2019s frown only grows deeper, but Bruce returns the smile\u2014warm and relaxed, if a little shallow. It\u2019s the same smile Tim\u2019s seen him give during press interviews.\u00a0\n\u201cOf course. I didn\u2019t mean to imply anything to the contrary,\u201d he says easily. \u201cCan I ask who\u2019s looking after you while they\u2019re away?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOur housekeeper, Mrs. McIlvaine,\u201d Tim answers smoothly. This part at least, he\u2019s had plenty of practice explaining over the years. \u201cShe\u2019ll be over later this afternoon.\u201d\n(What Tim doesn\u2019t mention is that Mrs. Mac is just dropping off groceries and tidying up a bit before heading back home, and that he won\u2019t see her again until Tuesday. But what the Waynes don\u2019t know can\u2019t hurt them.)\nBruce hums thoughtfully. \u201cWell in that case, we\u2019d be happy to have you join us for breakfast while you wait for her,\u201d he invites. \u201cI believe Alfred has been preparing quite the spread.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed, sir.\u201d As if on cue, an older gentleman in a suit and waistcoat appears in the doorway, causing Tim to startle for the second time that morning. \u201cOur menu this morning consists of spinach and feta quiche, sliced fruit, and fresh-baked cinnamon rolls.\u201d He bows slightly to Tim. \u201cAlfred Pennyworth, at your service. We\u2019d be delighted to have you, Master Drake.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s really kind of you, but I would hate to impose...\u201d Tim\u2019s face heats up as he realizes he\u2019s  definitely already done that with his impromptu sleepover. \u201cOr, impose any more, I mean,\u201d he amends guiltily.\nThat earns him a snort of laughter from Jason. \u201cYou\u2019re not imposing. At least not any more than Dick does when he swings by every other weekend to guzzle orange juice straight from the carton and fuck up my GTA save files on the PS4 while he does his laundry.\u201d\n\u201cLanguage, Jay,\u201d Bruce grunts while Alfred gives the boy a stern look. The latter seems to be a far more effective form of chastisement, as it causes Jason to shrink back.\n\u201cSorry. But really, you should stay,\u201d he continues to Tim. \u201cAlfie\u2019s cinnamon rolls are like crack, and when we\u2019re finished you can help me ruin some of  Dick\u2019s  save files.\u201d\nTim hesitates. Breakfast  does sound nice\u2014much nicer than whatever box of stale cereal he\u2019s likely to find in the pantry at home. And, if he\u2019s in this deep already, it might be more polite to accept at this point than to refuse...\nIn the end, it\u2019s his stomach that decides for him, letting out a truly obnoxious-sounding growl.\n\u201cI guess the matter is settled then,\u201d Bruce chuckles, leading a very red-faced Tim into the dining room.\nThe food is every bit as delicious as promised. Tim declines Jason\u2019s offer to borrow some comfier clothes (\u201cGod, you actually  slept  wearing that? Longest I\u2019ve lasted in a tux was like four hours, and I was ready to murder someone by the end\u201d/ \u201cLanguage, Jay...\u201d/ \u201cWhat? I was!\u201d), but he does remove his jacket and tie, which helps him feel a bit less overdressed for the occasion.\nThen again, he fits in just fine with Alfred.\n\u201cSo how old are you now, Tim?\u201d Bruce asks as Alfred serves up the quiche. \u201cYou go to Gotham Academy, correct?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been there since kindergarten,\u201d Tim replies, nodding his thanks to the butler as he deposits a piece of quiche onto Tim\u2019s plate. \u201cAnd I\u2019m twelve years old.\u201d\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re in, what, sixth grade? Seventh?\u201d Jason pipes up over a mouthful of cinnamon roll.\u00a0\nTim glances down at his plate, feeling his cheeks burn. He hates explaining this, no matter how much his parents try to convince him it will give him an edge one day on his college applications and future job prospects. \u201cNinth, actually,\u201d he corrects. \u201cI, um, tested out of second and fifth.\u201d\nJason gives a low whistle. \u201cDamn...\u201d he mutters, earning a warning look from Alfred.\n\u201cThat\u2019s very impressive,\u201d Bruce says, looking thoughtful. \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware that Gotham Academy allowed students to skip grades.\u201d\nThey don\u2019t, normally. In fact, all of the counselors had advised against it\u2014something about potential long term negative impacts on peer social relations, or whatever. But when your parents have a hand in the pocket of half the members of the school board, it seems anything is possible.\n\u201cThey... made a bit of an exception,\u201d Tim evades. \u201cPlus, I\u2019m actually almost thirteen.\u201d\n(Well, in four months, that is.)\n\u201cThat\u2019s cool,\u201d Jason says, stabbing a grape on the end of his fork tine. \u201cI\u2019ll be sixteen this summer.\u201d He grins and glances over at Bruce. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna let me drive the Jag when I get my license, right B?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll drive whatever has the highest safety rating,\u201d Bruce answers automatically. \u201cWhich I\u2019ve actually been researching extensively, and have determined...\u201d\nJason rolls his eyes and mouths a very exasperated  here we go again  at Tim and Alfred as Bruce launches into a long-winded explanation of the various high end mid-size sedans on the market and their respective safety ratings. At some point, Jason starts flapping his lips and opening and closing his hand in a puppet motion whenever Bruce is looking away, and Tim has to keep taking bites of his quiche hide his grin.\n(Bruce keeps such a straight face that Tim might think he was unaware of his son\u2019s mocking, if not for the fond little twinkle in the corner of his eye.)\n\u201cSo what kind of stuff do you like to do?\u201d Jason asks him once Bruce has finished his little spiel about the cars.\u00a0\n You mean besides stalking you guys most nights? Tim\u2019s mind supplies helpfully.\u00a0\n\u201cI like photography,\u201d is what he actually says. \u201cUrban shots, mostly. And I skateboard sometimes.\u201d He pauses, then adds, \u201cAnd I\u2019m kind of into coding.\u201d\n\u201cCoding, huh?\u201d Bruce looks genuinely interested. \u201cWhat type of coding?\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Tim begins, trying to ignore the fluttering sensation in his stomach because  holy shit Batman is asking him about his hobbies. \u201cI started out teaching myself Java and Python, but then I kinda just... branched out? I like to design my own apps and stuff. It\u2019s all pretty intuitive.\u201d\nJason snorts, breathing out a quiet,  sure it is, and Tim instantly kicks himself. He\u2019s really got to work on not sounding like a stuck-up little prick. Most of his classmates have already labeled him one, on account of him being a full head shorter than them while also taking Honors Bio.\n\u201cThat\u2019s cool though,\u201d Jason throws in when Tim goes quiet. \u201cI\u2019m not that great at computer stuff. I\u2019ve always liked the humanities better. But Bruce and Dick are always trying to get me into it, so I know the basics. It\u2019s awesome that you like it, though.\u201d\nSomething in Tim\u2019s gut untwists at Jason\u2019s casual remark. Maybe he hasn\u2019t totally fucked this up yet.\nFrom there, the conversation shifts to Jason describing the D&amp;D campaign he\u2019s running with the school\u2019s drama club during their off-season. Tim\u2019s never played before\u2014as that\u2019s the kind of activity that would require having multiple friends at once\u2014but it honestly sounds fascinating. He\u2019s so invested in the explanation that he almost doesn\u2019t notice when his phone starts to buzz.\n Mom,  the caller ID reads. Tim gulps.\n\u201cExcuse me just a moment please, I really need to take this,\u201d Tim apologizes, getting to his feet. \u201cIt\u2019s my parents.\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely, go right ahead,\u201d Bruce agrees with a nod, and Tim slips back into the hall they entered through.\nOnce out of the room, he takes a deep breath, then accepts the call. \u201cHi Mom.\u201d\n \u201cTimothy!\u201d  Janet exclaims, sounding about as flustered as he\u2019s ever heard her. \u201cOh my goodness, we just landed at San Pedro. Please tell me you made it home.\u201d\nTim winces. \u201cI\u2019m... actually still at the Waynes?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re  what?\u201d Her pitch goes up at least an octave.\n\u201cThey invited me to stay for breakfast,\u201d Tim explains quickly. \u201cThey were really insistent\u2014I didn\u2019t want to be rude.\u201d\n\u201cWell you\u2019d better not be being rude! Your father and I have been trying to get a partnership with Wayne Enterprises ever since they first branched out into textiles back in \u201809. I swear to God, Timothy, you\u2019d better not mess this up for us...\u201d\nTim rolls his eyes. After all, he\u2019s not the one who forgot his twelve-year-son at the neighbor\u2019s gala and jetted off to Central America before even realizing his mistake, but sure, he\u2019ll try to keep it together.\u00a0\n\u201cI won\u2019t, Mom,\u201d he promises. \u201cI\u2019ve been on my best behavior, just like you taught me.\u201d\nThat seems to mollify her. She sighs, but it sounds more tired than exasperated this time. \u201cWell, please see that you continue to do so.\u201d There\u2019s a pause, then, in a gentler tone she adds, \u201cWe really are glad to hear you\u2019re alright, Tim. We realized just after take-off, and spent the entire flight fretting.\u201d\n(That admission shouldn\u2019t make Tim feel as warm as it does.)\n\u201cI\u2019m perfectly fine,\u201d he assures. \u201cThe Waynes have been really nice to me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to hear that,\u201d Janet says, and she sounds as though she truly means it. \u201cPlease give Mr. Wayne our apologies for the inconvenience, as well as our sincerest thanks for his hospitality.\u201d\n\u201cI will.\u201d\n\u201cAlright. Well your father has just gotten the last of our luggage from the carousel, so we\u2019ll be on our way to the hotel now,\u201d she says. \u201cBe sure to remember your manners. We\u2019ll chat soon, alright? Bye for now.\u201d\n\u201cBye Mom, love y\u2013\u201c\nThe line cuts out.\nTim closes his eyes and allows himself two full breaths. Then he plasters on a smile and heads back into the dining room.\nEvery school has that one asshole who takes gym class too seriously, and at Gotham Academy, he goes by the name of Derrick Goldstein.\nDerrick Goldstein is fueled on a diet of protein powder, blue Powerade, and school cafeteria burritos. He\u2019s captain of the football team, the lacrosse team, the swim team,  and  the lesser-known table tennis club. He\u2019s seventeen years old, six-foot-one, 225 pounds, and the owner of a thriving TikTok account where he routinely challenges buff-looking dudes on the street to utterly absurd physical competitions in exchange for Olive Garden gift cards (which Tim\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019s been swiping from his dad, the local branch\u2019s general manager).\u00a0\nHe\u2019s also the reason Tim\u2019s currently flat on his back on the gymnasium floor, blinking back stars and cursing the day he asked his counselor to sign him up for \u2018Athletic P.E.\u2019 rather than sticking with \u2018Freshmen Boys\u2019 as his vision blurs and ankle pulses in time with his heartbeat.\n\u201cMy bad,\u201d Derrick says, offering Tim a hand up. Or two. Or three. He\u2019s having a hard time focusing his eyes at the moment, but he supposes that\u2019s what you get when you\u2019re body-checked halfway across the floor hockey court by the school\u2019s resident tank.\nIt takes two tries for Tim to grasp Derrick\u2019s hand, and then the older boy pulls him to his feet so quickly that the momentum nearly sends Tim toppling forward. His head rushes and white hot pain shoots through his right ankle when he puts his weight on it, a strangled little yelp slipping out before he can bite it back.\n\u201cYou alright, Drake?\u201d Coach Miller calls from the sidelines.\n\u201cHnngh...\u201d Tim groans, eyes shut tight against the sudden wave of dizziness and nausea. Derrick\u2019s grip is about the only thing keeping him from crumpling to the ground.\nHe hears Miller mutter a curse, then, \"Todd!\"\nTim's eyes snap open again as the coach hollers across the field toward a group of boys on the opposite sidelines, motioning one of them closer. Jason, looking startled for only a moment, chucks his hoodie at someone and jogs over.\u00a0\n\"What's up, Coach?\" His eyes dart between the older man and Tim\u2014who is breathing very, very carefully to keep from puking on Derrick Goldstein\u2019s Nikes.\u00a0\n\"Help Drake get to the nurse.\"\u00a0\nThe coach doesn't wait for a response before he\u2019s turning away again with a shout of \"Hey don\u2019t climb on that!\" to some kids on the far court. He\u2019s gone before Tim knows what hit him.\n(No, that\u2019s not true.  Derrick Goldstein  hit him.)\nJason hurries over and grabs Tim\u2019s elbow to steady him. \u201cAlright. I\u2019ll take it from here, man,\u201d he tells Derrick, who grunts gratefully before releasing Tim and heading back to the game.\nThe second the other boy is gone, Jason turns to Tim. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Timmy? Almost didn\u2019t recognize you without the penguin suit. Are you usually with the B group for Athletic?\u201d\nTim nods dizzily. \u201cMm,\u201d he hums in affirmation. \u201cKinda wish I still was.\u201d\nJason huffs out a short laugh. \u201cYeah. Derrick has some self-control issues. And a general douchebag issue, but we try not to say it to his face.\"\nTim snorts at that, but it quickly turns into a hiss of pain when he tries to take a step forward.\u00a0\n\u201cWait, hang on.\u201d Jason readjusts his grip, leaning forward slightly to sling Tim\u2019s arm around his shoulders. \u201cDon\u2019t try to put weight on your foot,\u201d he advises, straightening up again and wrapping his arm behind Tim\u2019s waist for support. \u201cJust lean on me, okay? I got you.\u201d\nTim nods again, teeth gritted. That sounds like a much better idea; it\u2019s taking most of his focus just to keep upright at the moment.\nThey make it three tiny hops forward before Tim overbalances, swaying into Jason\u2019s side, which earns him a frown. \u201cAre you dizzy?\u201d Jason asks in concern. \u201cYou didn\u2019t hit your head or anything, right?\u201d\n Oh yeah,  Tim definitely hit his head. He\u2019d smacked the back of his skull straight into the hardwood when he fell. No, scratch that, when he was  launched off Derrick Goldstien\u2019s stupid massive pecs.  But with both his parents and Mrs. Mac out of town until Sunday, he really doesn\u2019t want this situation to escalate any further.\n\u201cNah, I\u2019m fine,\u201d he lies, even as black spots dance across his field of vision. \u201cAnkle\u2019s just kind of distracting me...\u201d\n\u201cOof, yeah, been there,\u201d Jason says as they continue making their way off the field. \"Hopefully it's not broken or anything. Might've just hyperextended it\u2026\"\nAnd that's how their walk to the nurse goes: with Jason rambling on about the differences between a break, sprain, and fracture in a level of detail that can only be spoken of from experience.\u00a0\n(Which, Tim supposes, would make a lot of sense, given his...  hobbies.) \nThe nurse winces in sympathy when they finally come limping into the office, Jason depositing Tim down onto a vinyl-covered cot. \u201cWell this certainly doesn\u2019t look good,\u201d she remarks, already grabbing an ice pack from the freezer.\n\u201cFloor hockey day,\u201d Jason says by way of explanation, and the nurse gives a little hum of understanding as she writes him a pass back to class. He takes it, accepting Tim\u2019s mumble of \u2018thanks\u2019 with a smile and a little salute that he tosses over his shoulder as he heads out again.\n\u201cAlright, sweetie.\u201d The nurse pulls a chair up to the edge of the cot and takes a seat. \u201cLet\u2019s see what we have here.\u201d\nShe checks over Tim\u2019s foot carefully, prodding at parts of it and asking him questions about what happened and where it hurts and which ways he can and can\u2019t bend it. Tim grits his teeth and cooperates as best he can\u2014aside from omitting the minor detail about how his ankle is only causing half of his pain at the moment.\u00a0\n(Speaking of that, he\u2019d never realized how bright the school\u2019s fluorescent lighting was before, but  wow is that definitely not helping with the building headache.)\nWhen her little exam is complete, the nurse sits back with a sigh. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t see any obvious fractures, but it\u2019s definitely starting to swell already, so you should really stay off of it for at least the rest of the day. Probably go see a doctor as well, just to make sure. I\u2019m going to go ahead and wrap your ankle now, and then you can start icing it while I give your emergency contact a call, okay?\u201d\nTim nods and murmurs his thanks. It\u2019s a lost cause of course, with his parents in Greece and Mrs. Mac in Arizona for her son\u2019s wedding, but the nurse certainly doesn\u2019t need to know that.\nAnd anyway, it\u2019s fine. This isn\u2019t the first time Tim\u2019s found himself stranded somewhere without a ride home. He just needs to make it to the end of the school day when they legally can\u2019t keep him any longer, and luckily, Tim\u2019s got a whole contingency plan in place for this.\u00a0\nAs it\u2019s currently third period, that means all he has to do is:\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a01) Play dumb while the nurse separately attempts to get a hold of both of his parents\u2014who, unbeknownst to her, are using their international SIM cards at the moment. This should buy Tim a class period or so while she waits for a call back.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a02) Suggest the nurse try his third contact, Mrs. Mac\u2014who just so happens to be one of the few individuals left on this planet who exclusively owns a landline phone.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a03) Act surprised when Mrs. Mac doesn\u2019t pick up (which she won\u2019t, on account of her being in Arizona).\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a04) Claim that his dad just texted him.  He\u2019s in a meeting, he says, but should be here soon.  This should bring Tim up to sixth period or so.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a05) Blame traffic when no one has shown up by seventh.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a06) During eighth, explain that,  ha ha, just his luck, isn\u2019t it,  his dad got a flat tire on the way and is currently waiting for roadside assistance.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a07) Wait until a few seconds after the final bell to announce that Jack just pulled into the pick-up lane. As it\u2019s now after hours, this should eliminate the need for an in-person sign-out.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a08) Hobble himself far enough off of the school grounds that he can call a cab, and Tim is home free.\nOr, at least, he  will be  home free, if he can manage to avoid any suspicions of a head injury. And it\u2019s vital that he does so, because the liability issues wrapped up in  that might just earn him an ambulance ride to Gotham General once the school admin realize that no one is coming for him.\u00a0\n(And Tim would really like to avoid that.)\nSteps 1-4 of Tim\u2019s plan go off without a hitch. He stretches out on the cot and ices his ankle\u2014twenty minutes on, twenty minutes off\u2014with his eyes closed in an attempt to ease the pounding in his skull. He can\u2019t bring himself to look at his phone screen for more than a few seconds at a time, so he entertains himself by idly piecing together whatever bits of conversations he overhears from passing students in the hall and imagining it\u2019s all one coherent narrative. He thinks he dozes off a few times, but it\u2019s hard to tell.\nThe trouble comes around the end of fifth period, when the nurse suddenly decides that  poor little Timmy  could do with some lunch, so she sends another student down to the cafeteria to bring him back a tray. Gotham Academy\u2019s fish sticks are a bit nauseating on a good day, and this is definitely not a good day.\nBut Tim is  determined,  dammit, so he manages a few bites of the applesauce and corn that come with it, then waits until the nurse takes a bathroom break to chuck the rest of his food into the trash can.\n(The bright side is that between the headache and building nausea, Tim\u2019s barely noticing his ankle anymore.)\nBy the time Tim makes it to step six of his plan, the nurse is eyeing him suspiciously enough that for a brief moment he worries she\u2019s going to ask to see the text messages. But it seems luck is on his side because just then a sophomore girl comes stumbling in, her nose visibly crooked and gushing blood\u2014another unfortunate victim of floor hockey day\u2014and effectively diverts the nurse\u2019s attention.\nShe\u2019s still mopping blood off the girl\u2019s shirt when the bell rings to signal the end of eighth period, which is good for Tim because it means she barely notices when he starts gathering his stuff to leave. He\u2019s sitting on the edge of the cot, taking a few breaths and working up the nerve to actually pull himself to his feet when a familiar voice from the hall interrupts his thoughts.\n\u201cTim? You\u2019re still here?\u201d\u00a0\nTim snaps his head up\u2014which is a definite mistake as the sudden movement causes his vision to blur. He has to blink twice before he can make out Jason\u2019s head poking into the office.\nJason frowns. \u201cDude, gym was third period. I figured you went home hours ago.\u201d\n\u201cAh, yeah... I was having a little trouble getting a ride,\u201d Tim admits. From across the room, the nurse glances back at him, her brow furrowed like she\u2019s about to say something, so he immediately implements step seven. \u201cMy dad just texted though. He\u2019s waiting for me in the pick-up lane now.\u201d\nJason\u2019s expression instantly relaxes into a relieved smile, which makes Tim feel a twinge of guilt for the lie. \u201cOh, cool. I\u2019ll help you outside then,\u201d he offers, stepping into the nurse\u2019s office.\u00a0\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that, I can manage myself,\u201d Tim says quickly, already pushing himself up on his good foot. His head swims at the movement, but he thinks he does a decent job of not showing it.\u00a0\nJason snorts. \u201cI\u2019m literally on my way out and you can barely put weight on that foot. You\u2019d honestly rather  hop  yourself through the  Friday  after-school traffic than let me give you a hand?\u201d\nOkay, he does have a point there. The chance of Tim being able to make it out through his classmates\u2019 mad rush to the doors in his current state without incident is slim to none, and if Tim waits here much longer, the nurse might just decide to walk him out herself.\n\u201cWell, I guess if it\u2019s not too much trouble...\u201d\n\u201cDefinitely not,\u201d Jason assures with a short laugh. He grabs Tim\u2019s backpack\u2014which the nurse asked the janitor to retrieve from the locker room earlier\u2014and slings it on over his own before guiding Tim\u2019s arm around his neck again. \u201cHobble at will.\u201d\nThanks to the couple of minutes that have passed now since the final bell, the traffic in the halls has thinned out enough that they can make it outside without getting jostled, but all the noise of the exiting students\u2019 chatter is still enough to ramp the pain level in Tim\u2019s head up a few notches. He ends up closing his eyes through most of the journey, trusting Jason to keep him from crashing into anyone. If Jason notices, he doesn\u2019t say anything about it.\n\u201cAlright, which one is your dad\u2019s car?\u201d Jason asks once they\u2019re standing outside in the agonizingly bright sun.\n\u201cOh, I think he\u2019s toward the back of the line somewhere,\u201d Tim says, gesturing vaguely at the queue of waiting cars. \u201cBut I\u2019m good, I can take it from here. Thanks for the help.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you take me for, a half-assed escort?\u201d Jason laughs. \u201cNah, we can just start walking down there and you let me know when you see him, okay?\u201d\nTim groans internally.  Damn Jason and his helpfulness.  He\u2019s going to have to come clean. \u201cLook, um, the thing is...\u201d he begins, \u201che might not... actually be here?\u201d\nJason stops walking, turning his head to look at Tim. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\nTim winces. \u201cHe\u2019s kind of... in Greece at the moment? Uh, with my mom. Until Sunday.\u201d\nJason blinks at him. \u201cSo who\u2019s picking you up then?\u201d\n\u201cA cab?\u201d Tim\u2019s voice squeaks up in pitch on the last word and he mentally curses puberty for always cropping up at the worst times. He clears his throat, then adds quickly, \u201cI just need to get off campus first. If I make it down to the corner of Fletcher and 32nd, that should be far enough.\u201d\nJason snorts. \u201cYeah, well, that\u2019s not happening.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Tim\u2019s confused. \u201cNo, that should be far enough. I\u2019ve gotten a cab from there before.\u201d\nJason rolls his eyes. \u201cNo, I meant you taking a cab home to an empty mansion when you\u2019re injured,\u201d he says slowly, emphasizing each point. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s not happening.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? No, I\u2019ll be fine\u2013\u201d Tim tries to protest, but Jason has his phone out of his pocket and pressed against his ear already. He holds up one finger\u2014looking startlingly like Janet for a second\u2014and Tim finds himself shushing on reflex.\n\u201cHey, Alfie,\u201d Jason says into the phone. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m outside already\u2014I see you.\u201d He waves at the line of cars. \u201cListen, you remember Tim, right? From that gala back in April? Yeah. Okay, so...\u201d\nA few minutes later, a sleek black town car pulls up to the front of the pick-up lane. Jason ushers Tim into the backseat, then dumps their backpacks in the trunk and climbs in the other side, phone in hand.\n\u201cGood afternoon, Master Tim,\u201d Alfred greets, using the rearview mirror to make eye contact with him. \u201cIt\u2019s lovely to see you again, though I wish it were under better circumstances.\u201d\nTim feels his cheeks flush. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you again too, Mr. Pennyworth,\u201d he says. \u201cThanks so much for the ride.\u201d\nAlfred smiles warmly. \u201cMy pleasure, dear boy.\u201d He pulls the car back out of the pick-up lane. \u201cAnd please, call me Alfred.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a ride,\u201d Jason says without looking up. He\u2019s hunched over his phone, texting rapidly. \u201cI already told Bruce what happened. He says you\u2019re welcome to stay with us until your parents get back from their trip.\u201d\nTim\u2019s insides twist at the thought\u2014or maybe it\u2019s just the fact that they\u2019re beginning to pick up speed now. \u201cOh, there\u2019s no need for that, really, I\u2019d hate to impose,\u201d he protests weakly. \u201cI\u2019ll be just fine on my\u2013\u201d\n\u201cHey Timmy?\u201d Jason looks up for a brief second, thumbs still tapping the screen. \u201cJust shut up and take the help, alright?\u201d\n\u201cMaster Jason,\u201d Alfred says sharply, making Tim\u2019s head ring.\u00a0\nJason looks genuinely startled, then glances down sheepishly at his lap. \u201cSorry,\u201d he mumbles.\n\u201cI believe what Master Jason intended to say,\u201d Alfred goes on, \u201cwas that you are of no imposition at all. In fact to the contrary, it would ease our minds considerably to know you are being suitably looked after in your current state.\u201d\nTim hums a bit. He might have attempted another protest, but the motion of the car really isn\u2019t doing his stomach any favors, so it seems wiser to keep his mouth closed as much as possible. \u201cOkay,\u201d he mumbles. \u201cThank you, then.\u201d\nHe can hear the smile in Alfred\u2019s voice. \u201cOf course, lad.\u201d\n\u201cDick\u2019s staying over this weekend too,\u201d Jason adds. \u201cI dunno if you\u2019ve met him yet, but he\u2019s twenty-one and lives over in Bludhaven.\u201d He grins. \u201cHe can be kind of a pain in the butt sometimes, but he\u2019s  our pain in the butt, you know?\u201d\nIn the rearview mirror, Tim sees Alfred\u2019s lips twitch, but it seems to be more in amusement than scolding this time.\nJason then launches into some kind of story about the last time Dick lived up to this reputation involving something about a piece of raw salmon and a microwave, but Tim isn\u2019t really listening. The longer they drive, the more he\u2019s struggling to keep down the few bites he\u2019d managed of lunch, his head pounding incessantly. It\u2019s taking all of his effort to keep his expression neutral as he nods along to Jason\u2019s story.\nBy the time they turn onto the access road leading up to Wayne Manor, Tim honestly can\u2019t remember the last time he felt this awful.\u00a0\nJason\u2019s phone dings and he glances down at it. \u201cDick says he can\u2019t find any crutches,\u201d he announces.\n\u201cThat seems rather unlikely,\u201d Alfred replies dryly, \u201cgiven that we had no less than six pairs last time I took inventory downstairs.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I told him,\u201d Jason says, tapping at the phone again, \u201cbut he says B must\u2019ve reorganized down there because they\u2019re all gone now.\u201d\n\u201cAnd he\u2019s tried the main supply closet?\u201d\n\u201cYup.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the alternate supply closet?\u201d\n\u201cYup.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the storage room, near the southwest entry?\u201d\nMore tapping. Jason snorts. \u201cHe says he gave up already. He\u2019s just gonna come out and piggyback Tim inside.\u201d\nIf Tim had any brain cells to spare, he might have used them to dwell on the fact that  Nightwing  just suggested he simply  piggyback Tim  into  Batman\u2019s house. But as it is, he just keeps his head turned toward the window and eyes closed, breathing carefully through his mouth.\n\u201cWe should first check if our guest is comfortable with that arrangement,\u201d Alfred reminds gently. \u201cAnd if not, I am quite certain I can locate a pair if he wishes to wait in the car for a few minutes.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind,\u201d Tim mumbles, still not opening his eyes. At this point, he really doesn\u2019t care one iota how he gets out of this car, so long as he gets out as soon as possible.\nThere\u2019s one more turn, and then the car is rolling to a stop. Before Tim has the chance to prepare himself with a few measured breaths, his door is suddenly popping open.\n\u201cHey there, I\u2019m Dick. You must be Tim,\u201d greets the cheery voice, and Tim wishes he could force his eyes open to properly take in the moment he first meets  Nightwing,  but that seems like a very bad idea right now. \u201cJason\u2019s told me a lot about you.\u201d\n\u201cHmph,\u201d Tim says intelligently, his lips pressed tightly together, fingers fumbling to unbuckle himself.\n\u201cHey, you alright?\u201d He can hear Dick\u2019s smile fade from his voice. \u201cYou kinda look like you might\u2013\u201d\nVomit surges up Tim\u2019s throat. He releases the seatbelt and leans out of the car just in time to puke on Dick Grayson\u2019s shoes.\u00a0\n\u201cOh,\u201d is all Dick says.\n\u201cOh shit! Are you okay?\u201d Jason exclaims, and he can hear both driver\u2019s side doors popping open, followed by two sets of footsteps hurrying around the vehicle.\nTears are filling Tim\u2019s eyes now. \u201c\u2018M sorry, \u2018m so sorry,\u201d he all but sobs, and then he\u2019s pressing his fist against his mouth to try to contain the next gag.\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, lad, just let it out,\u201d Alfred advises from somewhere in front of him now, so Tim does so\u2014this time hitting the driveway. Dick has moved back and to the side a few steps, out of the line of fire, but he\u2019s still maintaining a supportive grip on Tim\u2019s shoulder to keep him from tumbling forward.\nDick makes a sympathetic noise. \u201cDid you get carsick?\u201d he asks gently.\u00a0\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t\u2013 I\u2013\u201d Tim tries to shake his head, but it only amps up the pain until another choked sob slips out. \u201cIt's my head,\u201d he admits in a whimper.\nThere\u2019s a low, urgent-sounding conversation between Jason and Alfred in the background, from which all Tim can make out clearly is Jason\u2019s hiss of, \"I asked! He said he didn\u2019t!\" and then Alfred is suddenly next to him, his hand on Tim\u2019s shoulder.\u00a0\n\u201cMaster Tim, this is very important. I need you to answer me honestly.\u201d Alfred\u2019s tone is calm, but firm, leaving no room for nonsense. \u201cDid you hit your head when you fell today?\u201d\nThere\u2019s no hiding it at this point. \u201cYes,\u201d Tim whispers tightly, and to his horror, a tear slips down his cheek.\u00a0\nThings are a bit of a blur after that. Tim is vaguely aware of more voices going back and forth, and then one set of footsteps is sprinting away and up to the house while someone else\u2019s fingers run over Tim\u2019s skull. He hisses involuntarily when they brush over the lump on the back of his head. Alfred mutters an apology, and Dick gives a few whispered reassurances, but the fingers continue to probe at him all the same.\nLess than a minute later he hears the Manor\u2019s front door opening, and then there are two sets of footsteps racing back towards him.\n\u201cTim.\u201d It\u2019s Bruce\u2019s voice now, low and serious, right in front of Tim\u2019s face. \u201cI need you to open your eyes, bud.\u201d\nTim forces himself to obey and is rewarded by blinding pain when a penlight shines back into his eyes. He gasps sharply, and squeezes his eyes shut again.\n\u201cI know, I\u2019m sorry, I just had to check.\u201d Bruce is down on one knee right next to the puddle of vomit on the driveway, eye-level with Tim. \u201cWe think you might have a concussion. We\u2019re going to take you to the ER.\u201d\n\u201cB\u2013Back in... the car?\u201d Tim chokes out, lips trembling. More tears are sliding down his cheeks, partly from the pain, and partly from the idea of vomiting in Bruce Wayne\u2019s car\u2014which he\u2019s about five hundred percent sure he will be doing if they transport him anywhere right now.\u00a0\n\u201cYes, but it\u2019s not far, I promise,\u201d Bruce says quietly. \u201cWe\u2019ll be there in ten minutes.\u201d\n\u201cBut I might... in your car, I\u2019m gonna\u2013\u201d Tim can\u2019t quite make himself say it.\n\u201cI brought a bucket,\u201d Jason pipes up. He climbs back in through the rear driver\u2019s side door and scoots across the backseat until he\u2019s next to Tim, a plastic bowl in his hands. \u201cIt\u2019s all good, dude.\u201d\n\u201cAnd even if you miss, it\u2019s not a problem,\u201d Bruce assures as he stands up and moves around to the driver\u2019s seat. Dick, who is somehow already wearing new shoes, hops into the front passenger side. \u201cCars can be cleaned.\u201d\n\u201cAnd this one in particular has been many a time,\u201d Alfred says with a small, almost fond sigh as he rebuckles Tim.\nOnce everyone is loaded in, Alfred says something about holding down the fort and trying to get in contact with the Drakes. Then he wishes them all the best of luck and closes the door.\u00a0\nAnd they\u2019re off.\nTim only throws up once during the ride to Gotham General\u2014which he could\u2019ve sworn was farther than ten minutes away, and yet somehow they make it there in a cool nine.\u00a0\nThe good news is that he gets it all in the bucket.\u00a0\nThe bad news is that his hands are shaking so badly that Jason has to hold the bucket for him, looking away and nearly gagging himself a time or two in sympathy.\n(Yeah, that\u2019s right.  Robin had to hold Tim\u2019s puke bucket. It\u2019s safe to say this is the worst day of Tim\u2019s life.)\nBy the time they arrive, Tim\u2019s feeling too awful to give even a hint of protest when Bruce scoops him up and carries him inside.\u00a0\nThe waiting room is not particularly crowded, but Tim\u2019s still surprised when he\u2019s taken back almost immediately. Whether it\u2019s because his head injury is really that worrisome, or because there just so happens to be a wing of this particular hospital with Thomas Wayne\u2019s name on it, Tim doesn\u2019t know, but he\u2019s grateful to be lying down on something solid nonetheless.\u00a0\nA whole bunch of questions, a physical exam, a couple neurological checks, a CT scan, and an x-ray later, Tim is diagnosed with a mild concussion and a sprained ankle. He\u2019s prescribed over-the-counter pain medicine and a children\u2019s strength motion sickness drug that should help with the nausea, given a brace for his ankle, and advised to get lots of rest.\n(So, all in all, a pointless trip.)\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry for all the trouble,\u201d Tim mumbles a few hours later as Bruce signs off on the last of the ER discharge papers.\u00a0\n\u201cTrouble?\u201d Bruce glances up from the clipboard, giving him a strange look. \u201cWe\u2019re just relieved that you\u2019re okay, Tim. You gave us quite a scare.\u201d\nTim hangs his head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It was just the car ride. I was okay before that, it just made me feel sick, and then\u2026\u201d He takes a breath. \u201cBut I should\u2019ve just held it in. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cTim.\u201d Jason, who has been playing some kind of game on his phone with Dick through most of the visit, is now staring at Tim like he\u2019s gone mad. \u201cAre you seriously apologizing for throwing up?\u201d\n\u201c...Yes?\u201d Goodness knows he\u2019s said it to his parents before. His mother still occasionally brings up that time he ruined her new Armani dress when he was eight. It was the same night that they first learned Tim was allergic to shrimp, although the parts about his lips swelling up and him breaking out in hives don\u2019t seem to have cemented themselves into her memory as much as the vomiting did. She never mentions those.\u00a0\n\u201cEspecially to you,\u201d he adds, shifting his gaze guiltily to Dick. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I puked on  Dick Grayson.\u201d \nDick bursts out laughing, but Jason just shrugs.\n\u201cI mean, who hasn\u2019t?\u201d Jason says casually. \u201cI know I have. He\u2019s very pukable.\u201d\n\u201cYeah and Jay puked chili dogs,\u201d Dick says with an exaggerated shudder. \u201cI promise, whatever you had for breakfast didn\u2019t even come close to that.\u201d\nTim frowns, readjusting the ice pack he\u2019s holding to the lump on his head. \u201cWhy did you puke chili dogs on him?\u201d\n\u201cThey were having a chili dog eating contest,\u201d Bruce answers for them. He passes the completed paperwork back to the nurse, nodding his thanks. \u201cFollowing a bit of... parkour.\u201d He sighs heavily. \u201cFor the record, I was against it.\u201d\n\u201cI won,\u201d Dick says brightly, then grimaces and adds, \u201cthough I may have also lost.\u201d\n\u201cOh he definitely lost,\u201d Jason quips, grinning. He leans into Tim\u2019s ear and whispers, \u201cDick doesn\u2019t know this, but I was totally aiming for him.\u201d\nTim just nods slowly, wondering when exactly he's going to wake up from this ridiculous dream he seems to be having.\nThanks to the Dramamine, the drive home is significantly less eventful. Tim still holds the (now clean) bucket on his lap just in case, but he\u2019s so drowsy from the medication and the overall day he\u2019s had that he\u2019s nearly asleep by the time they make it back to the Manor.\n\u201cAlright, wanna try this again?\u201d Dick asks as he hops out of the car and opens Tim\u2019s door. \u201cPiggyback round two?\u201d\nJason scoffs. \u201cOr if you\u2019d rather not tempt fate, Alfie texted that he actually found  seven  pairs of crutches downstairs.\u201d\n\u201cSeven?\u201d Dick wrinkles his brow. \u201cWhy do we even own that many?\u201d\nBruce starts ticking them off on his fingers. \u201cAuxiliary, forearm, gutter, extra tall...\u201d\n\u201cOhh yeah I forgot about that time with Kori...\u201d\n\u201c\u2013And a couple pairs of back-ups,\u201d Bruce finishes.\u00a0\n\u201cWe do a lot of sports,\u201d Jason says with a shrug, as though that explains everything. \u201cAnyway, you can take your pick. They\u2019re all adjustable\u2014except for the giant ones. That was like, a special order.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Um...\u201d Tim blinks, feeling rather overwhelmed. It\u2019s nice that they\u2019re giving him so many choices, but he\u2019s not exactly firing on all cylinders at the moment. He really just wants to get inside and sit down.\u00a0\n\u201cHow about I just carry you for now?\u201d Dick offers gently when Tim doesn\u2019t reply. \u201cAnd then we can sort out all the crutch stuff tomorrow?\u201d\nTim exhales gratefully. \u201cYeah. Yeah, that would be good. Thanks.\u201d\u00a0\nWhile Jason grabs their backpacks from the trunk, Dick crouches down in front of the seat so that Tim can climb on. The ride is surprisingly smooth for its speed, even when they have to go up the front steps.\u00a0\n\u201cAh, Master Tim,\u201d Alfred greets them at the door with a warm smile as Bruce pulls the car around to the garage. \u201cI have a guest room on the lower level ready for you. I\u2019ve also prepared chicken soup and fresh rolls for dinner. Would you prefer to eat in your bedroom, or at the table with the family?\u201d\nGreat, more choices. Honestly, Tim would much prefer the quiet of the bedroom, but it seems a little rude to go hide away when he\u2019s a guest in someone else\u2019s home.\u00a0\nThen again, he probably won\u2019t be a very good conversationalist tonight, so maybe it  would be  more polite to just accept the offer rather than risk saying something stupid in his current groggy state. He closes his eyes briefly and can practically see Janet\u2019s judging gaze as he weighs the options.\n\u201cLet\u2019s just go to your room,\u201d Jason suggests. \u201cIt\u2019s quieter and you look like you\u2019re falling asleep anyway. I\u2019ll stay and hang out with you while you eat.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Tim says, forcing a little smile. Hanging out with Jason will still require  some  brain power, but certainly less than being around the whole family, so it seems like a decent compromise. \u201cUh, thanks.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018Course.\"\nDick carries him inside, and then down the hall and over to the east wing of the Manor. They pass by a few different rooms\u2014a den, a study, another bedroom\u2014before arriving at a cozy, neutrally-decorated guest room furnished with a double bed, antique writing desk, and a large oak dresser.\n\u201cBathroom\u2019s right through here,\u201d Dick says, pointing to an adjoining room. \u201cDo you need to use it now? I can drop you off there.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine,\u201d Tim mumbles.\u00a0\n\u201cAlright, cool. I\u2019m gonna show you a trick then,\u201d Dick announces, moving over to the desk. He sets Tim down carefully in the leather desk chair, and then using his foot, he presses a lever on the chair\u2019s base which unlocks the wheels. \u201cSee?\u201d He grins, rolling Tim sideways a bit. \u201cMakeshift wheelchair. Just use your good foot to steer, and you can roll yourself wherever you need to go.\u201d\n\u201cAlmost like you\u2019ve done this before...\u201d Tim mutters wryly, then internally kicks himself. Dick\u2019s acrobatic past may be common knowledge, but otherwise as far as Tim\u2019s supposed to know, the Waynes are just another wealthy family from Bristol\u2014though perhaps a little eccentric.\nLuckily, Jason just snorts. \u201cOh yeah, Dick\u2019s a total klutz. He\u2019s the reason we own half those crutches.\u201d\n\u201cUh, excuse me, I seem to remember  you  being the last one on crutches,\u201d Dick retorts. \u201cAfter that crap-tacular attempt at a back handspring.\u201d\n\u201cThat one was your fault,\u201d Jason argues. \u201cYou said you were spotting me.\u201d\nDick rolls his eyes. \u201cI was halfway across the room, dumbass. You have to check where your spotter is before you leap.  I\u2019m not  Wally.\u201d \nTim spends the next few moments while Dick and Jason continue bickering trying to figure out just who this  Wally  guy might be\u2014a meta with flight powers, perhaps?  Superman?  Could Superman\u2019s name really be something as dumb as  Wally? \u00a0\nThen again, Nightwing\u2019s name is Dick, so anything is possible...\nUnfortunately, all the thinking makes his headache worse, so he gives it up rather quickly.\nJust as Dick is leaving, Alfred enters with a tray containing two bowls of chicken soup, two glasses of water, a stack of crackers, and a couple bread rolls, as well as Tim\u2019s next dose of painkillers.\n\u201cNow, as far as this evening in concerned,\u201d Alfred addresses Tim as he sets the tray down on the desk, Jason pulling up an extra chair for himself, \u201cI am quite certain we can locate suitable clothing and toiletry items for you here, but is there anything specific you\u2019ll be needing from home? Daily medication, or a comfort item, perhaps? Any pets that need to be fed or let outside?\u201d\nTim barely suppresses a snort at the idea that his parents would allow him to still have a \u2018comfort item\u2019 at this age, much less a pet. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t need anything from home, thank you.\u201d\n\u201cAlright then,\u201d Alfred says kindly. \u201cEnjoy your dinner, young sirs.\u201d And with that, he steps out.\nThe soup is nice, if a little bland. Jason\u2019s bowl seems to have some extra additions\u2014beans and more noodles and maybe a bit of cream\u2014whereas Tim\u2019s is mostly broth with a few pieces of chicken and veggies, which is good because that\u2019s about all his stomach is up for at the moment. He knows it\u2019s silly and probably just the concussion messing with his emotions, but seeing the two bowls there side-by-side, physical evidence of Alfred\u2019s thoughtfulness, kind of makes Tim want to cry.\n(He doesn\u2019t, of course. That\u2019s ridiculous.)\nAt first, Tim tries to make a bit of polite conversation the way he knows he\u2019s supposed to, commenting on the food and asking Jason about his day and his classes and so on. Jason answers each question with amusement, but when Tim\u2019s vision starts to blur from the headache to the point that he keeps rubbing at his eyes, the older boy puts a stop to it.\u00a0\n\u201cYou know we don\u2019t have to talk, right?\u201d Jason says. Then before Tim can take offense, he holds up a hand. \u201cI mean, don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014if you want to talk, we totally can. But if you\u2019d rather just have the quiet, I don\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Tim says, confused. \u201cBut\u2026 I thought you wanted to hang out?\u201d\n\u201cThis is hanging out,\u201d Jason says with a little laugh. \u201cWe\u2019re both here and we\u2019re chilling. I know how concussions are. I was always expecting you to go full zombie mode on me.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d\nAnd somehow, it isn\u2019t awkward at all as they both finish off their soup in relative silence.\nBruce stops in a little while later, just as Jason is gathering up the empty dishes to take out to the kitchen.\n\u201cHey, Tim,\u201d he greets softly, crouching down until he\u2019s eye level with the boy. \u201cI have some fresh ice packs, a pair of Jason\u2019s old pajamas, and a toothbrush you can use.\u201d\n\u201cHope the toothbrush is new,\u201d Jason snorts, and Bruce just rolls his eyes and flicks his son\u2019s arm.\u00a0\n\u201cThe toothbrush is new,\u201d he says flatly.\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Tim says, accepting the small stack of items that Bruce hands him.\n\u201cAlfred hasn\u2019t had any luck getting a hold of your parents through the numbers we had on file for them,\u201d Bruce goes on. \u201cIs there maybe an international number they\u2019re using at the moment?\u201d\n\u201cOh, um, yeah but I can just call them tomorrow,\u201d Tim says. It\u2019s already nearly eight o\u2019clock here. He\u2019s not sure what that is in Greek time, but it definitely sounds late. \u201cThey\u2019re probably asleep.\u201d\nBruce\u2019s brow furrows. \u201cTim, you were just in the hospital,\u201d he points out gently. \u201cI was able to sign off on your care by telling the staff that I was your neighbor and a family friend, but I\u2019m sure your parents would like to know what\u2019s going on as soon as possible.\u201d\nTim isn\u2019t so sure of that. After all, basically  nothing even happened at the hospital. Sure, there were some tests and scans and stuff, but it\u2019s not like they discovered there was bleeding in his brain or that he had to have surgery or anything like that. Hell, his ankle isn\u2019t even broken. A little bump on the head and a sore foot hardly seems like a reason to wake his parents at... two a.m.? Three a.m.?\nHe frowns and pulls out his phone, intending to open the time zone converter app he usually uses, but the brightness of the screen only sends fresh daggers of pain through his skull. He squeezes his eyes shut, sucking in a sharp breath through his teeth.\n\u201cOoh, yeah, don\u2019t look at that,\u201d Jason advises, reaching out and flipping Tim\u2019s phone over for him. \u201cScreens are like, the last thing you want right now, trust me.\u201d\n\u201cJust trying to figure out the time in Athens...\u201d Tim mumbles.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s a seven hour difference,\u201d Bruce supplies helpfully, and Tim wonders whether he\u2019d just looked that up himself, or if Batman is simply the type to have the whole time zone map memorized. Probably the latter.\u00a0\n\u201cSo it\u2019s...\u201d God, his head hurts. He\u2019s in advanced math for goodness sake\u2014simple arithmetic should not be this challenging. \u201c...three a.m.?\u201d\nBruce hums affirmatively. \u201cBut, like I said before\u2013\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t I just email them?\u201d Tim interrupts, in too much pain to care about politeness at the moment. \u201cThey\u2019ll probably see that sooner anyway.\u201d\nSomething suspiciously like concern flashes across Bruce\u2019s features, but then it\u2019s gone again, shifting fluidly into that interview smile of his. \u201cSure, bud. We can email them for now if you think that\u2019s best. But I\u2019ll go ahead and send it for you, okay?\u201d\nTim would protest, except that emailing would involve more staring at screens which he\u2019s just determined is Very Bad Indeed.\u00a0\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he agrees. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d Bruce stands back up. \u201cNow, would you like some help getting to the bathroom so you can change and get ready for bed?\u201d\n\u201cNo thanks,\u201d Tim says, unlocking the wheels on his chair again with a weak little grin. \u201cI can just roll there.\u201d\nBruce breathes out a small laugh. \u201cAh. Dick\u2019s preferred method.\u201d\nJason scoffs. \u201cNo, that\u2019s Dick\u2019s  lazy  method,\u201d he corrects. \u201cHis  preferred  method for foot injuries is to walk on his hands like the little show-off he is until he inevitably smacks into something and gets hurt even worse.\u201d\n \u201cOne time!\u201d  Dick\u2019s voice hollers from somewhere down the hall.  \u201cThat was one time, Jason\u2026\u201d \n(Honestly, what even is Tim\u2019s life right now?)\nBetween the drugs, the headache, and the overall exhaustion, Tim sleeps surprisingly well through the night. Jason ends up bunking with him, playing the role of \u2018concussion monitor\u2019\u2014which thankfully does  not involve waking Tim up to bombard him with questions every few hours as he fears, and is more about just having someone in the room who could theoretically go get help in case Tim\u2019s condition should worsen. He sleeps sprawled out on some kind of luxury three-foot-tall air mattress that Bruce apparently once brought along on a camping trip.\n(The only reason Tim doesn\u2019t feel guilty about the arrangement is due to how ridiculously comfortable Jason makes it look.)\nSaturday is a little hazy, but not horrible. Tim spends a lot of it napping, icing his head and ankle, taking painkillers whenever Bruce or Alfred instruct him to, and nibbling on whatever bland foods he can get down. He hasn\u2019t thrown up since the car ride yesterday, but he doesn\u2019t really want to risk it, especially once he agrees to make the trek from the hardwood-floored guest room out to the carpeted den after lunch.\u00a0\nSometime in the early afternoon, Dick and Jason get the bright idea to demonstrate the pros and cons of each of the various styles of crutches by creating an obstacle course in the den with furniture and random objects to maneuver through while Tim observes from the couch. It\u2019s all quite amusing, until Jason gets a bit too cocky and his crutch slips on the cover of one of the magazines they\u2019d scattered around the room. He trips over a shoe rack, narrowly avoiding his forehead smacking into the edge of the coffee table by about three centimeters.\n(Alfred promptly bans that activity after that.)\nTim carefully tries out a few options and determines he likes the crutches that wrap around his forearms the best, which he uses whenever the rolling chair isn\u2019t practical.\u00a0\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not until two p.m. that Tim\u2019s parents finally reply to Bruce\u2019s email. Tim knows this because Bruce tells him immediately when they do so, having previously mentioned their  lack of reply  several times throughout the morning.\u00a0\nTim doesn\u2019t find his parents\u2019 behavior strange at all. It\u2019s the last day of their dig, and the email clearly stated that Tim was  just fine,  so honestly, what\u2019s the big deal? But Bruce and Alfred seem to think otherwise.\u00a0\nAnyway, Jack and Janet are very appreciative in their response, apologizing for the inconvenience, thanking the Waynes sincerely for looking after their son, and assuring Bruce that they\u2019d be happy to reimburse him for any and all expenses incurred\u2014exactly as Tim expected them to.\nThey don\u2019t call, which again, Tim is not surprised by. It\u2019s a busy day, since they have to pack up the dig site, and he\u2019ll be seeing them tomorrow anyway, but Dick and Jason keep shooting him these weird pitying looks whenever they think he isn\u2019t looking.\nTim doesn\u2019t want to deal with it anymore, so he just takes another nap.\nJason re-enters the blissfully quiet den just as Tim is finishing up his dinner of leftover soup that evening. The others all ate at the table, but Bruce and Alfred made a point of emphasizing that no one would be offended if Tim would rather eat in here, so he\u2019d taken them up on it.\n\u201cOkay, so we were all talking out there and we\u2019ve got a couple options for tonight\u2019s entertainment,\u201d Jason begins. \u201cWanna hear them?\u201d\n\u201c...Sure?\u201d Tim wasn\u2019t really expecting entertainment; there definitely wasn\u2019t any last night. Then again, he was significantly more dead-to-the-world last night than he is now, and he\u2019s probably slept more hours than he\u2019s been awake today, so having something else to do before bed might actually be nice.\nJason smiles. \u201cCool. So option one, if you\u2019re still not feeling good, you\u2019re of course welcome to just stay in here and nap or whatever\u2014with or without company. We all get that head injuries suck, so no one will take it personally, I promise.\u201d\nTim nods slightly.\n\u201cOr, if you\u2019re tired of doing that, option two is we could do a movie\u2013\u201d\nTim winces at the thought.\nJason holds up a hand. \u201c\u2013and, I know what you\u2019re thinking, but it actually could  work. See, a couple years ago, Dick got poked in the eye with a\u2026 stick. Don\u2019t ask how, long story,\u201d he adds quickly before Tim can say a word, \u201cand he had to get surgery on it and wear an eye patch for a while, so it fucked up his depth perception, which was super annoying. But he still wanted to watch movies because he\u2019s not a big reader, so Bruce looked into it and figured out that some DVDs have an optional audio description track on them.\u201d\nTim\u2019s brain is still processing things at about half speed, so it takes him a few seconds to catch up once Jason pauses his rambling. \u201cThey have a... wait, what?\u201d he asks, blinking.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a narrator,\u201d Jason explains, \u201cexcept they\u2019re just narrating the parts of the movie that you\u2019d normally be watching. So for example, in Lion King, for that whole \u2018Circle of Life\u2019 thing, you still hear the song and the movie\u2019s sound effects and whatever, but there\u2019s an added audio layer with this lady voicing over stuff, telling you when the baboon holds Simba up, and how the animals are bowing down, and all that. It\u2019s supposed to be for blind or visually impaired people, but it\u2019s like the subtitles\u2014you can just turn it on and off, so anyone can use it.\u201d\n\u201cHm,\u201d Tim says. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d He\u2019d always just kind of assumed blind people didn\u2019t watch movies, but now he feels a little ignorant for that.\n\u201cSo we could try that,\u201d Jason offers. \u201cOnly thing is, it\u2019s kind of hard to get used to watching TV with your eyes closed. Dick ended up having to wear a blindfold whenever he did it because otherwise he kept peeking and would wind up with a headache anyway.\u201d\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d Tim says, a little warily. He\u2019s not too keen on the idea of being blindfolded in someone else\u2019s home\u2014and can\u2019t even  imagine  what his mother would say about it\u2014but he also doesn\u2019t really want to be tempted to peek at the screen and end up puking Alfred\u2019s soup on the sofa.\n(It\u2019s such a  nice sofa, after all.)\n\u201cOr, the third option is I could read for a while,\u201d Jason offers with a little shrug.\nTim furrows his brow. \u201cWait, like... out loud?\u201d\nJason rolls his eyes. \u201cNo, to myself, in my bedroom,\u201d he deadpans. \u201cYes of course out loud.\u201d\nTim can\u2019t even remember the last time someone read aloud to him outside of a classroom setting. He was already reading on his own pretty well by age four or five\u2014something Jack and Janet loved  to boast about to their friends at parties\u2014so his parents told the nannies to back off as much as possible except when Tim needed help sounding out the occasional word. He was supposed to be practicing independence, after all.\u00a0\nTim\u2019s still not quite wrapping his head around the concept. \u201cBut... wouldn\u2019t you be bored doing that?\u201d\n\u201cWhy would I be bored?\u201d Jason laughs. \u201cI fucking love reading. Plus, I get to do voices and stuff, and I\u2019ve got a killer Australian accent I\u2019ve been working on, should the need arise.\u201d\nTim hums a bit. \u201cWhat would you read?\u201d he asks.\nJason shrugs again. \u201cWhatever you want. I know you\u2019ve seen the library already\u201d\u2014Tim feels his cheeks burn at the reminder of his previous visit\u2014\u201cso you know we\u2019ve got a ton of options. It\u2019ll probably be best if you pick something you\u2019ve already read though, so it\u2019s easier to follow along.\u201d\nJason starts rattling off various book options\u2014everything from Agatha Christie, to Douglas Adams, to Suzanne Collins. Tim nods along, mostly just letting the words wash over him. He\u2019s not the biggest fiction reader these days (he\u2019d probably peaked in that regard back in elementary school, before he\u2019d skipped enough grades that his academics and other hobbies were taking up all his time), but he\u2019s read a few of the titles that Jason lists off.\u00a0\n\u201cUh, we can try The Book Thief,\u201d Tim interrupts Jason\u2019s rambling, his brain latching onto one of the titles he remembers back from when his teachers still did in-class readings. \u201cThat\u2019s the one where Death is the narrator, right?\u201d\n\u201cYep,\u201d Jason says. \u201cI love that book. So does Bruce, but he\u2019s emo like that. If you want, we can move out to the family room? It\u2019s got more couches and it\u2019s closer to the snacks. I think Alfie\u2019s gonna bake some snickerdoodles\u2026\u201d\nAnd so that\u2019s how they end up spending their Saturday evening, with Tim curled up on the chaise section of the Wayne family sofa, drifting in and out of the story as Jason\u2019s steady voice reads in the background. Bruce sits in a recliner, tapping at his tablet as he listens, while Dick stretches out on the floor doing some kind of ridiculous flexibility routine that just shouldn\u2019t be human. Alfred joins them after a while, depositing a tray of cookies on the coffee table before settling down into a cushioned rocking chair to knit.\nSomehow, in spite of Tim\u2019s brain feeling like overcooked oatmeal, it\u2019s the best night he\u2019s had in a long time.\nOf course, all good things must come to an end, and that end occurs at two-thirty Sunday afternoon, when Jack Drake\u2019s BMW pulls into the circle out front of the Manor.\n\u201cThank you again so much, Mr. Wayne,\u201d Janet gushes, her hand on Tim\u2019s shoulder as she steers him towards the door. \u201cWe really appreciate your hospitality.\u201d\n\u201cYes, we hope our boy hasn\u2019t given you too much trouble!\u201d Jack chuckles jovially, taking Tim\u2019s backpack from Alfred with a nod of thanks.\n\u201cNone at all,\u201d Bruce assures, his own business smile firmly in place. \u201cWe were happy to help and it\u2019s been a pleasure having Tim stay with us. He\u2019s welcome back anytime.\u201d\nWhile Jason and Dick help Tim hobble out to the car on his borrowed crutches, Jack spends a few minutes chatting with Bruce about some kind of business venture he\u2019s  certain  Wayne Enterprises would be the perfect partner for. Meanwhile, Alfred hands Janet several extra ice packs, a ziplock bag of over the counter medications (complete with a dosing schedule), and a detailed list he\u2019d typed up that morning with general concussion tips and specific notes about Tim\u2019s care. She accepts them all graciously, promising to look them over at home.\n\u201cYou should come over again sometime,\u201d Jason says as he helps Tim climb into the backseat. \u201cYou know, when we\u2019ve actually planned it and you\u2019re not like, a gala stowaway or injured and stranded somewhere.\u201d\nTim winces. \u201cYeah, I really need to stop doing that.\u201d\n\u201cNah, it\u2019s cool\u2014we\u2019re pretty used to rolling with the punches here,\u201d Jason says, and Tim has to hold back a snort because  how the heck have these guys not been found out yet?  \u201cBut if you hand me your phone, I can give you my number so we can text?\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d Tim agrees, passing the phone over with a small but genuine smile. \u201cThat\u2019d be great.\u201d\nWhile Jason types in the contact info, Dick gives him a little wave. \u201cIt was really nice to meet you, Tim.\u201d\n\u201cDoubt it,\u201d Tim mutters, his face flushing as he recalls that particular introduction.\nDick laughs. \u201cOkay, fine. The initial meeting left a little to be desired,\" he allows. \u201cBut good news is, it was all uphill from there!\u201d\nTim can only wince.\n\u201cI put Dick\u2019s number in too,\u201d Jason says, handing back the phone. \u201cAnd Bruce\u2019s and Alfred\u2019s. Collect \u2018em all.\u201d\nDick snorts. \u201cAlfred is definitely going to try and send you a Farmville invite. I swear, he\u2019s the only person on earth still playing it.\u201d\n\u201cOh, wow, thanks,\u201d Tim says, feeling a bit dazed from the fact that his phone now contains the numbers for Batman, Robin, Nightwing,  and Alfred Pennyworth\u2014the nicest man alive.\u00a0\n(Maybe he\u2019s the one who\u2019s secretly Superman. With enough make-up, anything is possible\u2026)\nEventually, Jack seems to accept that he\u2019s not about to close another deal today. He thanks Bruce once again and bids him farewell before he and Janet both slide into the car.\n\u201cSo, how are you feeling, sport?\u201d Jack asks as he pulls the car around the circle and back toward the access road, Janet still smiling and waving at the Waynes through the window.\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Tim shrugs. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt as bad today. The meds help a lot.\u201d\n\u201cSpeaking of that, why is there Dramamine in here?\u201d Janet frowns, having dropped her act enough now that they\u2019re out of eyesight to actually examine the bag Alfred gave her. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen you get carsick.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s for the concussion,\u201d Tim explains. \u201cHelps with the nausea.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Janet wrinkles her nose up a bit. She\u2019s never been great with vomit. \u201cI see.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to get sick now, are you?\u201d Jack asks warily. \u201cBecause I just got this car detailed...\u201d\nTim huffs out an amused little breath. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine, Dad.\u201d\nSure enough, they make it the mile back to the Drake Estate without incident. Tim hobbles himself inside while Jack grabs his backpack for him\u2014jokingly grumbling the whole time about how it must be full of bricks.\nInside, the usual sea of suitcases and boxes of specialized equipment are scattered about the entryway and front room. Tim has to hop carefully with his crutches to avoid tripping on anything.\n\u201cGuess we\u2019ll have to unpack on our own this time,\u201d Janet mutters to her husband as Tim makes his way to the nearest chair.\nTim winces guiltily. Over the years, the Drakes have worked loading and unloading down to a science. Tim usually helps his dad lug suitcases and boxes up and down the stairs while Janet takes inventory of each new artifact or antique acquired, documenting their handwritten field notes and the items\u2019 new locations down on an Excel spreadsheet. \u201cSorry,\u201d he says, nodding to his ankle. \u201cDon\u2019t think I\u2019ll be much help right now.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps you could do your mother\u2019s job,\u201d Jack suggests. \u201cYou can probably run a spreadsheet, eh, son?\u201d\nTim hesitates. Of course he can run a spreadsheet; he\u2019d designed his first one himself at the age of six to catalog his various Lego and K\u2019nex sets, complete with autofill formulas and everything. It\u2019s just that it\u2019ll require a lot of staring at a screen.\nBut then again, it\u2019s not like the screen will be moving or making noise like the TV would so... maybe it\u2019ll be okay? And his dad is looking at him so hopefully...\nJanet sets the bag of medication down on the credenza, tossing the instruction sheet Alfred gave her on top of the stack of mail that Mrs. Mac\u2019s been collecting for them without so much as a glance. \u201cCould you, Timothy?\u201d she asks with a sigh. \u201cWe\u2019re both exhausted and it\u2019ll get us through this mess faster, especially if I have to be lugging things upstairs with my bad knee...\u201d\nSo Tim swallows down his protests, plastering on a slightly-subdued version of his gala smile. \u201cSure, yeah, I can run the spreadsheet,\u201d he agrees. \u201cNo problem.\u201d\nJanet smiles\u2014a genuine, grateful smile\u2014and Jack beams at him. \u201cThat\u2019s my boy!\u201d he says, clapping Tim on the shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t know what we\u2019d do without you.\u201d\nAn hour and a half later, when the bags are all unpacked and Tim\u2019s curled up alone on the edge of his bed in a ball of pain, his eyes squeezed shut and head hanging over the trash can while he tries his best not to lose the four tabs of ibuprofen he just choked down, he hates how he still thinks it was worth it just to hear their praise.\nAfter the worst of Tim\u2019s concussion symptoms have subsided, Jason starts inviting him over to the Manor once or twice a week to hang out after school. They do their homework together, and play video games, or read, or watch TV, and if it happens to be one of the nights Tim\u2019s parents are out of town, Alfred or Bruce usually insist he stay for dinner. Tim accepts the offer about half of the time, always being careful to make sure he\u2019s out of their hair before nightfall.\nAs it\u2019s not very practical to scale fire escapes and leap between rooftops with a bum foot, Tim\u2019s injuries force him to take a bit of a break from his nighttime photography sessions, but he\u2019s back at it again within the month, for better or for worse.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s kind of funny, really. Tim\u2019s known the Bats\u2019 secret identities for nearly four years now, but it wasn\u2019t until he started getting to know the  Waynes  that he realized just how much of their personalities bleed through when they\u2019re in the capes, as well as the ways in which they actively work to cover that up.\u00a0\nCase in point:\u00a0\nNightwing and Dick Grayson both break into the exact same shit-eating grin after making a bad pun, but they have different iced coffee orders at the local Java Hut.\u00a0\nRobin frequently spouts off nineteenth century literature quotes to the perps he takes down, while Jason Todd prefers to make impassioned rants about the stupid choices made by the fictional characters in whatever book he\u2019s reading.\u00a0\nBatman is well-known for his hyper-vigilance in the field, whereas last week Bruce Wayne\u2019s two silently-giggling sons managed to tie his shoelaces together while he was napping in a La-Z-Boy.\nAgent A keeps a cool head over the comms in any emergency situation, and yet when Jason\u2019s pet mouse\u2014Holden Clawfield\u2014escaped his cage a few days ago, Alfred Pennyworth stood on the countertop shouting something along the lines of \u2018If that bloody rodent comes within two meters of my trouser leg, I am  not  above getting out the broom and\u2013\u2019 until he was captured again.\nAll in all, Tim\u2019s learning a lot.\nBy the time summer rolls around, Tim\u2019s been roped into joining the Wayne family D&amp;D campaign. He\u2019s still a little fuzzy on the rules, but Jason advised him to play a druid for his first character, so he usually just turns himself into a bear at the first sign of trouble.\u00a0It\u2019s been working quite well so far.\n\u201c\u2013And as my bonus action, I cast prestidigitation,\u201d Dick announces for what must be the eighth time that evening. He\u2019s playing some kind of overly-complicated wizard character which requires six pages of convoluted backstory and spell notes and yet he just keeps casting the same simple cantrip over and over. \u201cTo season the leftover stew.\u201d\nTim giggles, while Jason, the DM, just rolls his eyes. \u201cWe are literally in the middle of battling a Fire Giant, and you want to use your action on that.\"\n\u201cYup!\u201d Dick beams.\nJason heaves out a sigh. \u201cFine. Go on then.\u201d\nPicking up the wooden prop wand he\u2019s insisted on bringing to every session (though Jason assures Tim is not in any way required for the game), Dick makes an elaborate wrist flicking motion with it. \u201cThe stew now tastes like the Fire Giant\u2019s Nana\u2019s beef goulash,\u201d he declares.\nFrom across the table, Alfred\u2014the party\u2019s bard\u2014breaks into a knowing smirk. \u201cAnd I would now like to use my previously deferred action to invite the Fire Giant to lay down his flaming boulders and join us in some stew.\u201d\nJason gives the butler a very unamused look. \u201cRoll for persuasion.\u201d\nAlfred rolls his emerald-colored twenty-sided die. \u201cEighteen,\u201d he declares primly. \u201cPlus my modifiers gives me a twenty-four.\u201d\n\u201cAlright, that\u2019s it!\u201d Jason flips the tri-fold laminated screen in front of him in exasperation. \u201cYou two can\u2019t keep ruining every combat scene by persuading the bad guys out of fighting!\u201d\n\u201cBut it\u2019s so effective,\u201d Dick argues, while Tim\u2014who is still playing a bear and is therefore unable to contribute to the dialogue\u2014just continues to giggle.\n\u201cNon-violent conflict resolution is a vital skill in life,\u201d Alfred says with a sage nod. \u201cOne we should all try to emulate more often,\u201d he adds, side-eying Bruce.\n\u201cYou know, I\u2019m actually with Jason on this one,\u201d Bruce, the barbarian, grumbles. \u201cI\u2019d like to finally get to use my Blood Spear one of these days...\u201d\nThey don\u2019t make it very far through their quest that evening, but despite Jason\u2019s increasingly dramatic rants, Tim gets the impression that no one really minds at all.\n\u201cSo what are you doing for your birthday?\u201d Jason asks one afternoon in July as he and Tim are sprawled out on the family room sectional sofa, deep in the midst of wrecking not Dick\u2019s, but Bruce\u2019s GTA save file this time. Apparently he\u2019d eaten the last of Jason\u2019s favorite ice cream last night and this is the boy\u2019s form of payback.\n(As Tim is quickly learning, Jason is petty as shit.)\n\u201cOh, nothing really,\u201d Tim says, watching intently as Jason blows through a fence and into a field with his stolen pick-up truck, nearly offing a deer. Tim\u2019s parents filed a permit for an archeological expedition in Egypt, and if they get approved, they\u2019ll be staying through the end of August. \u201cMrs. Mac usually makes me a carrot cake.\u201d\n\u201cHuh.\u201d Jason wrinkles his nose up. \u201cYou like carrot cake?\u201d\nTim shrugs. \u201cI mean, cake is cake. It\u2019s not my favorite, but I think I thanked her a bit too enthusiastically for it once because she makes it for me every year now. I\u2019m kind of in too deep to say anything at this point.\u201d\nJason snorts and shakes his head slowly, eyes still fixed on the screen. \u201cOnly you, Timmy...\u201d\u00a0\n \u201cOnly me?\u201d Tim echoes, his eyebrow raised. \u201cSo I guess you\u2019ve finally told Alfred how much you hate his paste-waffles then?\u201d\nJason rolls his eyes. \u201cNo, but that\u2019s like his one anomaly, so\u2013\u201d\n\u201cAnd I guess Dick\u2019s told him about the \u2018bland-ass cucumber sandwiches\u2019?\u201d Tim challenges, making finger quotes around the older boy\u2019s term.\n\u201cThe guy\u2019s British, okay? Cut him some slack,\u201d Jason defends, which only makes Tim\u2019s smirk grow. \u201cIt\u2019s not his fault that they colonized half the world for spices and only learned how to use like six of them.\u201d\u00a0\nJason\u2019s truck catches air going over a hill. It flips end to end, then barrel rolls another twenty yards or so before he zooms off again like nothing happened.\u00a0\n\u201cHe does make really good cinnamon rolls,\u201d Tim says after a moment, feeling a bit guilty for his slander.\u00a0\n\u201cHe makes good  everything,\u201d  Jason corrects as he swerves the truck back onto the main road. \u201cExcept for waffles and\u2013\u201d\u00a0\nHe cuts himself off as the door to the den suddenly opens.\u00a0\n(Speak of the Devil...)\n\u201cHey Alfie,\u201d Jason says, without missing a beat. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\u00a0Tim, who is biting the inside of his cheek to keep from laughing at the butler\u2019s impeccable timing, can only nod in greeting.\n\u201cHm. I figured you two might be getting a bit peckish,\u201d Alfred comments dryly, moving over to the coffee table with a tray in hand. \u201cSeeing as you\u2019ve been playing that dreadful game for hours now.\u201d He casts a judging look at the TV.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fun, though,\u201d Jason points out, and Alfred only \u2018hmphs.\u2019\nHe sets the tray down in front of them, and Tim and Jason exchange a grim smile. \u201cThank you, Alfred,\u201d they recite in unison.\nAlfred\u2019s lips twitch upwards almost imperceptibly. \u201cMy pleasure, boys,\u201d he says with a little nod.\nJason waits until Alfred has shut the door to the den behind him again and they can hear his footsteps retreating down the hall before letting out a dramatic groan.\nTim\u2019s lips spread into a smug grin. \u201cSo anyway, wanna come over next week for carrot cake?\u201d\n\u201cShut up, Tim,\u201d Jason grumbles as he reaches across the table for a cucumber sandwich.\nIt turns out, the Drakes don\u2019t get their permit approved for Egypt, which puts them in a rather bad mood.\u00a0\nTim does his best to stay out of their way. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s scared of them or anything\u2014his parents have always been more passive-aggressive than outright aggressive\u2014but the shorter their tempers are, the more nit-picky things they tend to say to him, and that\u2019s reason enough for Tim to keep to his room as much as possible.\u00a0\nThey do, however, get approved for a dig in the neighboring country of Bialyia a few days later, which they\u2019d only applied for on a longshot due to the country\u2019s recent civil unrest. The embassy is being a bit tricky, so they aren\u2019t quite sure how long they\u2019ll be staying this time, but they set up the usual system with Mrs. Mac for twice-weekly grocery delivery and cleaning services before jetting off on their next adventure.\nJuly nineteenth falls on a Wednesday this year, so in addition to her usual grocery haul, Mrs. Mac shows up Tuesday morning with a frosted carrot cake, a tub of store-brand Neapolitan, and a pack of birthday candles. She serves up cake and ice cream to both Tim and herself, and then proceeds to babble on for a few hours about how old Tim\u2019s getting and how much he reminds her of her own son at that age. Apparently, Matthew McIlvaine had gotten a lawn mower for his thirteenth birthday and started up his own little landscaping business with a few of the neighbor kids. It was all going quite well until they decided to pool their earnings into buying an old ATV, which they promptly took out for a joyride at a nearby gravel yard and flipped the damn thing in some kind of near-death accident.\u00a0\n(It\u2019s why Matthew only has nine toes now.)\nTim nods along to her rambling, occasionally inserting a polite little \u2018hm\u2019 or an \u2018oh wow that\u2019s crazy\u2019 as appropriate. It\u2019s not that he doesn\u2019t like chatting with her, it\u2019s just that with Mrs. Mac, it\u2019s less \u2018chatting\u2019 and more the equivalent of listening to a long-winded live podcast that goes on for hours at a time and can\u2019t be paused.\nShe\u2019s just launching into her next tale of Matthew\u2019s failed business ventures\u2014this one involving illicit hamster breeding\u2014when the doorbell rings.\n Thank god. \u00a0\n\u201cExcuse me just a moment,\u201d Tim says, slipping out of his seat and making a beeline for the door.\u00a0\nHe\u2019s got his fingers crossed for an Amazon delivery. On any given year, there\u2019s about a fifty-fifty chance his parents will remember to send him a gift. He\u2019s been hinting at a particular new high-resolution camera lens for a while now.\n(And by \u2018hinting,\u2019 Tim means providing the direct link to the lens in an email to his father with the subject line \u2018This is what I would like for my birthday please.\u2019)\nBut when Tim opens the door, he\u2019s not met by a cardboard box.\n\u201c\u2018Sup birthday boy?\u201d Dick greets cheerily.\nTim just stares.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have company, do you?\u201d Jason is standing beside his brother on the porch, side-eying the rusty Honda Civic parked in the driveway. \u201cGuess we should\u2019ve called\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s just Mrs. Mac,\u201d Tim explains, still thoroughly confused as to why they\u2019re here. Jason may be off school for the summer, but Dick\u2019s got a full-time job teaching youth classes at a gymnastics studio in Bludhaven, so why on earth is he here at three p.m. on a  Tuesday? \n\u201cOh, nice.\u201d Dick grins. \u201cDo we get some cake then?\u201d\n\u201cUh\u2013\u201d\n\u201cDick\u2019s a weirdo,\u201d Jason murmurs as he steps in, glancing behind Tim to make sure Mrs. Mac is out of earshot. \u201cHe actually  likes carrot cake. Even the kind with raisins.\u201d\n\u201cOf course I like raisins. Raisins are great,\u201d Dick quips as he follows the other boy inside. \u201cLittle pop of sweetness. Nature\u2019s candy, all that jazz.\u201d\n\u201cRight\u2026\u201d Tim\u2019s feeling kind of dazed. He shakes his head to clear it. \u201cUm, sorry\u2014did we have plans?\u201d\n\u201cJason!\u201d Dick groans. \u201cDid you seriously forget to invite him to his own party?\u201d\n\u201cOf course I invited him!\u201d Jason retorts, then he frowns. \u201cWait, didn\u2019t I?\u201d\nTim shakes his head. \u201cI think I\u2019d remember that.\u201d Especially considering it\u2019d be the first birthday party Tim\u2019s been invited to since he skipped fifth grade and alienated  that whole class of kids.\n\u201cHuh.\u201d There\u2019s a pause. Then Jason shrugs. \u201cWell, I had a whole conversation about it with you in my head then. Head-Tim agreed.\u201d\nDick heaves out an exasperated sigh.  \u201cTim,\u201d he addresses pointedly, \u201cwould you like to come and sleepover tonight for your birthday? You\u2019re allowed to say no, even if Jason\u2019s head has already RSVP\u2019d.\u201d\nTim huffs out a short laugh. \u201cYeah, sure, I\u2019ll come over.\u201d\n\u201cKnew it,\u201d Jason quips smugly, and Dick flicks his arm. It makes Tim grin. \u201cSo, you wanna go throw some stuff in a bag, or\u2026?\u201d\nTim glances back over his shoulder. \u201cYeah. Uh, the only thing is\u2026\u201d He lowers his voice to a whisper. \u201cMrs. Mac was kinda in the middle of telling me this story, uh, which has been going on since like, noon, so...\u201d\nJason snorts humorously. \u201cSo this is a hostage situation?\u201d\nTim winces. \u201cShe means well, it\u2019s just\u2013\u201d\n\u201cTimothy?\u201d As if on cue, Mrs. Mac pops her head out from the kitchen. \u201cDo you have guests, dear?\u201d\nDick leans in close to Tim\u2019s ear. \u201cGo pack, I got this,\u201d he whispers, and before Tim can say a word, he\u2019s striding confidently towards the kitchen. \u201cMrs. McIlvaine, I presume?\u201d he asks as he approaches.\nMrs. Mac does a double take. \u201cWhy, yes. And you are?\u201d\n\u201cRichard Grayson-Wayne,\u201d he greets warmly in what Tim immediately recognizes as a Gala Smile\u2122, his right hand already extended out to clasp hers. \u201cIt\u2019s so lovely to meet you. Tim\u2019s been absolutely raving about this carrot cake of yours...\u201d\nHe shoots a wink back over his shoulder, and before Tim knows what\u2019s happening, Jason\u2019s pulling him away upstairs to pack.\nSomehow, through the power of social graces Tim can\u2019t quite wrap his mind around, Dick has them out of there in ten minutes flat. What\u2019s even more amazing is that Mrs. Mac doesn\u2019t seem the least bit offended by this. To the contrary, she\u2019s so charmed by Dick (who, as it turns out,  also  reminds her of Matthew) that she writes  his  birthday down in her little dog-eared planner with the promise of bringing him a carrot cake too.\n\u201cShe seems nice,\u201d Dick remarks as they all pile into his car. He\u2019s moving slightly more gingerly than normal, Tim notes. He\u2019s not sure what that\u2019s about. \u201cChatty, but nice.\u201d\n\u201cYeah. She is,\u201d Tim agrees. Ever since his nannies started getting phased out, Mrs. Mac has been the closest thing he\u2019s had to a consistent adult presence in his life. Apart from the rare occasions when she\u2019s out of town, she\u2019s here twice a week, every week, without fail. She might be an old busybody and chat his ear off sometimes, but Tim can\u2019t help but hold a certain fondness for her. After all, she seems to genuinely  want  to interact with him.\n(It\u2019s more than he can say for certain people in his life.)\nAfter arriving back at the Manor, the boys spend most of the afternoon engrossed in a Mario Kart tournament. Bruce even joins in for a while, and he ends up being  weirdly good at the game, though Tim supposes that shouldn\u2019t have come as a surprise considering some of the insane maneuvers he\u2019s seen the Batmobile pull.\u00a0\nFor dinner, Alfred makes maple glazed pork roast and twice baked potatoes. He honestly is a very good cook\u2014at least when he\u2019s not feeling particularly sentimental towards his homeland. No one really knows why his waffles are such a flop.\n\u2026Tim does have a theory, however, which is entirely based on a single nostalgic look he observed on Bruce\u2019s face upon being passed a plate of said-waffles a few weeks ago, followed by an almost inaudible murmur of \u2018just like Mom\u2019s\u2026\u2019 \n(Tim\u2019s beginning to wonder if, for all her virtues, Martha Wayne perhaps wasn\u2019t much of a chef.)\nAnyway, the food is delicious. When everyone\u2019s had their fill, Alfred slips out to the kitchen and returns with a cake. It\u2019s lemon poppyseed\u2014Tim\u2019s actual favorite cake flavor\u2014something he\u2019s positive he\u2019s only mentioned to Jason  once.\u00a0 \nThe only issue is that between dinner and his afternoon with Mrs. Mac, Tim has no earthly clue where he\u2019s supposed to put it.\nLuckily he doesn\u2019t have to stress for too long, because Jason takes one look at the cake and slumps back in his chair with a little moan. \u201cAlfie, I love you,\u201d he declares solemnly, \u201cbut if I eat one more bite right now, I\u2019m gonna hurl.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cLanguage, Jay,\u201d Bruce grunts from across the table.\n\u201cHow is that language?\u201d he challenges. \u201cIt\u2019s a bodily function!\u201d\n\u201cAnd this is a dinner table.\u201d\nDick huffs out a laugh. \u201cI\u2019m with Jason on this one. I think it\u2019s just a fact.\u201d He looks over at Tim. \u201cIs it cool if we do the cake later? Like, maybe after a movie?\u201d\nTim smiles gratefully. \u201cYeah, that\u2019d be good.\u201d Then, feeling a twinge of guilt, he glances over at Alfred. \u201cUm, if that\u2019s alright with you?\u201d\nHe\u2019s fully expecting to hear the butler\u2019s polite reassurance of \u2018of course, Master Tim\u2019 or \u2018that\u2019s perfectly fine, sir,\u2019 so he\u2019s thrown completely off-guard when instead, Alfred heaves out a rather dramatic sigh.\u00a0\u201cWell, far be it from me to inadvertently induce vomiting,\u201d he says dryly. \u201cLord knows I\u2019d be the one cleaning it.\u201d\nTim is taken aback for a second, but then  Bruce  of all people lets out a snort, which triggers both Jason and Dick to burst into laughter. Alfred shoots him a wink, and Tim feels his lips spreading into a grin.\nHe could get used to this.\nTim is assigned the role of choosing the movie. It\u2019s supposed to be a birthday perk\u2014or at least that\u2019s how Dick and Jason sell it to him. In reality, it\u2019s just super anxiety-inducing, even when they all insist they\u2019ll be fine with whatever he wants.\nIn the end, Bruce seems to pick up on Tim\u2019s distress and intervenes, suggesting the boys give him three acceptable choices to pick from.\nTim decides on Knives Out\u2014primarily because he\u2019s already seen it and therefore doesn\u2019t have to worry about it sucking, but also because he wants to see the others\u2019 reactions to it. Bruce admits he\u2019s already had the ending spoiled for him (by someone called \u2018Hal\u2019, whom he\u2019d proceeded to grumble about for the next few minutes, much to his sons\u2019 amusement), but the film is new to the others, which is perfect for Tim\u2019s purposes.\nIt turns out Dick is a big movie talker, which entertains Tim and exasperates Jason to no end. He provides a running commentary of his predictions throughout the whole first half-hour of the film, accusing no less than four individuals of the murder, then coming up with an absolutely absurd theory involving some kind of off-screen disgruntled reader-turned-assassin. To Tim\u2019s surprise, it\u2019s Alfred who indulges him, dryly suggesting even more off-the-wall additions to Dick\u2019s conspiracies. This goes on until Jason, who has requested that Dick \u2018just shut up and watch the movie\u2019 several times already, playfully jabs an elbow into his brother\u2019s side at his next remark.\nAnd that\u2019s when it all goes to hell.\nA horrible pained noise somewhere between a gasp and a choked-off grunt bursts forth from Dick\u2019s lips. He stifles it almost instantly, but everyone is already staring at him. Bruce and Alfred\u2019s gazes are sharp and worried while Jason\u2019s eyes are wide with horror.\n I\u2019m sorry,  he mouths at Dick, looking far guiltier than the situation should call for.\nAnd suddenly, Dick\u2019s presence here mid-week, his careful movements, the little limp Tim observed from him on his way to the family room... it\u2019s all starting to make sense.\nTim glances over at Bruce, and the man quickly flicks his gaze back to the TV like nothing happened. \u201cYou boys alright over there?\u201d he asks, his tone as casual as if he\u2019s commenting on the weather.\n\u201cYeah, fine.\u201d Dick\u2019s eyes are watering, but he still manages to huff out a short laugh.  \u201cSomeone  here just has pointy-ass elbows\u2026\u201d He gives Jason\u2019s shoulder a half-hearted shove for good measure.\n(Perhaps most tellingly, no one reminds Dick to watch his language.)\nLowering his gaze, Tim can see a nickel-sized red stain on the left side of Dick\u2019s t-shirt that he\u2019s pretty sure wasn\u2019t there a minute ago. Dick seems to notice this at the same moment Tim does, because in one fluid motion, he\u2019s suddenly shifting his arm to cover the spot and pushing himself up to standing. \u201cI think I\u2019m gonna make us some popcorn,\u201d he announces.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll assist,\u201d Alfred says, already out of his seat. \u201cI\u2019d rather like to avoid setting off the smoke alarms tonight.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s probably for the best, Al,\u201d Bruce chuckles tightly, grabbing the remote to pause the movie. \u201cDick can burn anything. Right, Jay?\u201d\u00a0\nHis face is perfectly neutral, but there\u2019s something like an order in his eyes. Tim\u2019s seen that look plenty of times, but never from Bruce. Only from Batman.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Jason says distractedly, still staring at his brother with an almost haunted look to his eyes.\nDick clears his throat, quick to pick up the slack. \u201cHey, I\u2019ve been getting better,\u201d he quips, flashing them all a weak imitation of his usual cheeky grin. \u201cI hardly ever burn pop-tarts anymore.\u201d\n\u201c...Only because you started eating them raw,\u201d Jason mutters.\nIt\u2019s subtle enough that a few months ago, Tim might not have noticed, but after all the time he\u2019s spent with the Waynes recently he can\u2019t help but feel it. Their banter is just a little stiffer, the timing off by a fraction of a second. Clearly, they\u2019re all working together to cover for Dick, but given that  every single one of them  seems to be in on it, Tim isn\u2019t sure who exactly they would be\u2013\nOh.  Duh.\u00a0 \nSometimes he forgets he isn\u2019t supposed to know.\nLuckily though, Tim is  really good at galas. And while this particular social interaction may not technically be a gala, the same rules are at play. There\u2019s a give and a take when it comes to the peddling of bullshit, and if you want those around you to feel at ease selling theirs, you have to give a little back.\nSo Tim? Tim  grins.  He grins until his eyes scrunch up, and he laughs like it\u2019s the funniest thing Jason\u2019s ever said, and in return he watches as all four faces surrounding him visibly relax.\nHe\u2019s got this.\nAlfred and Dick return fifteen minutes later with steaming bowls of popcorn in hand. A dark hoodie now covers Dick\u2019s white t-shirt\u2014which despite the fact that it\u2019s an eighty-five-degree day in July, absolutely no one comments on. Bruce resumes the movie, and Dick launches right back into his running commentary, doubling down on his disgruntled off-screen assassin theory until Jason\u2019s annoyance level is right back up to where it was before the intermission.\nIn fact, Dick does such a convincing job of acting Completely and Totally Fine\u2122 that by the time the end credits are rolling, Tim\u2019s pretty much forgotten about the earlier incident.\u00a0\nIn the kitchen, Alfred serves up cake and ice cream while they all debate the merits of the film\u2019s actual ending.  Tim ends up eating two whole pieces, a feat even he is not entirely sure how he manages, given how generous Alfred\u2019s slices are, but it\u2019s just so good.\u00a0\n(And, if Tim is being honest with himself, it\u2019s possible that he\u2019s stalling a bit. He just really doesn\u2019t want this night to end.)\nEventually though, the conversation winds down and Alfred and Bruce stand up to start clearing off the table.\u00a0\n\u201cOh shoot!\u201d Jason jumps up from his seat. \u201cWe never gave you your present! Hang on, lemme grab it,\u201d he says, already halfway out of the room.\n\u201cPresent?\u201d Tim says, feeling a bit overwhelmed. This whole evening has been his gift; he definitely wasn\u2019t expecting anything more.\u00a0\nCupping a hand over his mouth, Dick leans in to stage-whisper into Tim\u2019s ear. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we made sure Bruce didn\u2019t go crazy.\u201d\nBruce raises an eyebrow at his son. \u201cWhen have I ever \u2018gone crazy\u2019?\u201d\n\u201cOh I dunno, maybe Jason\u2019s first Christmas?\u201d Dick counters in the tone of  duh, and Bruce visibly winces.\nTim actually knows this story already. Jason told it to him offhandedly a while back when they\u2019d somehow gotten on the topic of gift-giving fails. Apparently, Bruce had tracked down first edition copies of twelve of Jason\u2019s favorite novels and gifted them to the boy a mere three months after taking him in. He\u2019d been hoping that the grand gesture would help Jason feel more secure of his place in the family.\u00a0\nIt backfired spectacularly however when Jason burst into tears upon glimpsing the price on the order form (which had accidentally gotten tucked in between two pages) and then proceeded to have a panic attack so bad that Alfred had to stand outside his locked bedroom door for two hours talking him down. Bruce ended up reselling the books to a private collector three days later and donating the proceeds to one of Gotham\u2019s more reputable homeless shelters.\u00a0\nThese days he just buys Jason normal hardcovers.\nJason jogs back into the room, a small box tied with ribbon in his hands. \u201cHappy birthday!\u201d he says as he tosses it over.\nTim has to fumble to catch it. He unwraps it carefully, and inside finds a little velvet pouch containing a full set of D&amp;D dice. They\u2019re gorgeous\u2014the resin a vibrant red, bleeding into black and flecked with shimmering gold, with hand painted numbers on top in an ornate script.\n\u201cWe figured you should have your own set,\u201d Jason says with a shrug. \u201cSince you\u2019re in the campaign now and all.\u201d\nTim nods, staring at the glittering dice in his hand. He knows, objectively, that this isn\u2019t a  big deal  or anything. He\u2019s looked up custom dice sets online before and the vast majority sell for under fifty dollars, so it\u2019s hardly the most expensive gift he\u2019s ever received. Hell, Tim was only six when his dad installed a 55-inch flat screen TV in his bedroom because Jack was, quote, \u2018tired of hearing those damn anime shows all the time.\u2019 But something about the idea that the Waynes got him a gift specifically to make the time he spends with them more enjoyable is making his throat feel strangely tight.\n\u201cDo you like them?\u201d Bruce asks after a moment, and Tim suddenly realizes he has yet to say a word. \u201cBecause if you\u2019d rather exchange them for a different style or color, we can definitely\u2013\u201d\n\u201cNo, no! They\u2019re perfect,\u201d Tim says earnestly. \u201cThank you so much.\u201d\nIt\u2019s official. This is the best birthday he\u2019s ever had.\nThey all troop off to bed around midnight, with Tim occupying the same guest room as last time. Jason sleeps upstairs in his own room, which Tim is perfectly fine with. As lovely as the whole day has been, it\u2019s also quite a bit more social interaction than Tim is used to (not to mention, he might be having some minor regrets about that second piece of cake), so he\u2019d much rather just sleep alone.\nExcept Tim doesn\u2019t sleep.\u00a0\nHe tries to, don\u2019t get him wrong. He lies in bed for an hour or two, his stomach making all kinds of unhappy noises at him while his mind is stuck on how utterly absurd it is that he\u2019s sleeping over at  Batman\u2019s house.  Sure, it might be his third time doing so, but Tim was too out of it on the other occasions to truly appreciate the experience, so they didn\u2019t really count in his book. Now that Tim is fully lucid, however, he\u2019s finding the whole concept honestly surreal.\nOne thing that Tim doesn\u2019t know is whether or not the Batcave is actually connected to Wayne Manor. The blueprints\u2014which he\u2019d pulled from the county clerk\u2019s office back when he was nine\u2014don\u2019t mention an underground level, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily rule it out. After all, there\u2019s no shortage of black market contractors in Gotham; how else would the Rogues build their elaborate death traps? Bruce Wayne could surely find someone to dig him out a basement on the down-low, right?\nThen again, the Cave doesn\u2019t have to be connected to the Manor\u2014it could be a different location entirely. Hell, maybe the \u201cCave\u201d isn\u2019t even  literal.  It could be like a code word for a safehouse, or maybe some kind of secret passage out of the city. He\u2019s never actually seen where the Batmobile zooms off to after a patrol, but that\u2019s mainly because he\u2019s always on foot. Maybe in a few years when he gets his license, he\u2019ll be able to actually follow it out of Gotham\u2026\nUgh. Tim groans and rolls over yet again to try to find a better position for his too-full stomach. Technically speaking, that second piece was really his third if he counts the carrot cake\u2014which he probably should, because Mrs. Mac isn\u2019t really one to skimp on portion size. And then there was the ice cream, and dinner, and that massive bowl of Distraction Popcorn that he\u2019d felt obligated to help the others eat, so... yeah.\u00a0\n\n Ugh. \n\nTim\u2019s an idiot.\nJanet would certainly think so. In fact, she\u2019d all but told him that one Halloween night, refusing to give her son any sympathy for his overindulgence. \"You\u2019ve made your bed, now lie in it, Timothy,\" she\u2019d told the seven-year-old tiredly when he\u2019d tiptoed into her bedroom to complain about not feeling well.\nTim didn\u2019t know that was a phrase back then. He thought she was just literally telling him to go back to his own bed, which he had. And then he\u2019d promptly puked in it.\u00a0\nThankfully, Ms. Sophie was still his live-in nanny at the time, and even though she was technically off the clock, she\u2019d heard Tim crying in his bedroom and gotten up to sort him out anyway. She was nice like that.\nTim doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s going to throw up now, but he could definitely use some water. He\u2019s visited the Manor enough times that he\u2019s pretty sure he can find his way to the kitchen in the dark, and with everyone else up on the second floor, he should have no problem getting there and back without disturbing anyone.\nDeciding sleep is a lost cause without it, Tim slips out of bed and creeps his way silently down the dark corridors and into the kitchen. He fills a glass with water at the sink, then sips at it slowly as he wanders over to look out the glass door leading to the gardens.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a muggy summer night, peaceful aside from the chirping cicadas and croaking frogs, so it\u2019s easy for Tim to lose himself a bit as he stands there gazing out. The sunflowers are easy enough to identify, as well as the tomato plants and bell peppers which are supported by wire cages. He thinks he sees orchids, and possibly hydrangeas? Tim\u2019s not much of a flower expert, but Mrs. Mac loves to garden, so he\u2019s picked up some terms over the years.\u00a0\nJanet has kind of a green thumb too, which is a bit paradoxical given how rarely she's in the country. But her succulents are always thriving and she was actually the one who\u2019d nursed their dying backyard pear tree back to life that summer when she\u2019d broken her leg and couldn\u2019t travel with Jack to Taiwan as planned.\nTim still thinks about that summer occasionally, and how he\u2019d probably seen more of his mother during those eight weeks than he had the previous few years combined. There was one particular day when she taught him how to make sun tea in a mason jar, and they\u2019d sat outside on the porch sipping it together, Janet\u2019s cast propped up on a footstool that Tim had dragged out for her. She\u2019d told him how the Turkish tea bags they\u2019d used reminded her of a time on one of their trips when Jack locked the keys in their rental car. The town\u2019s locksmith was a few hours out, so they sat outside at a coffee shop in Istanbul drinking spiced tea and watching the tourists pass by on the streets until\u2013\n\u201c...Calm down, B, I\u2019m fine.\u201d\nKnocked right out of his reverie, Tim instinctively ducks down behind the L-shaped kitchen island as the sound of Dick\u2019s muttering voice approaches.\n\u201cI\u2019ll calm down once we\u2019ve changed that dressing again,\u201d he hears Bruce retort, his voice equally low. \u201cAlfred said it was showing signs of infection earlier.\u201d\n\u201cNo, he said it looked a little red,\u201d Dick corrects irritably as he enters the kitchen. \u201cWhich it would be, after Jason\u2019s pointy-ass elbow popped two stitches.\u201d\n\u201cLanguage,\u201d Bruce grunts.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a descriptor,\" Dick grumbles. \"His elbows are pointy-ass. That\u2019s just what they are.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHn.\u201d\nA chair scoots across the floor over at the breakfast nook, and someone sits down on it heavily. Then a light comes on\u2014not the main overhead, but the small lamp directly over the table. It illuminates only the far end of the kitchen, leaving the island that Tim is crouched behind still in the shadows.\nThere are more sounds. A box unlatching. Paper-wrapped objects rustling against each other. The snap of latex gloves. A hiss of pain.\n\u201cOw, you\u2019re pulling on the\u2013\u201d There\u2019s a beat. \u201cOh.\u201d\n \u201cDick,\u201d  Bruce sighs, hard and exasperated.\n\u201cOkay but in my defense, it honestly didn\u2019t look that bad before! It was just a little red, I swear.\u201d\n\u201cSo what you\u2019re telling me is that it\u2019s getting worse,\u201d Bruce says flatly. \u201cAnd this is somehow supposed to be reassuring.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just saying the oozing is new, that\u2019s all.\u201d\nTim grimaces. He\u2019s kind of glad he has no line of sight at the moment. The mental images are doing nothing to help his already-queasy state.\n\u201cDid Alfred start you on antibiotics yet?\u201d\n\u201cNo, he just cleaned it and re-stitched it.\u201d\n\u201cHn. Then I\u2019m starting you on amoxicillin.\u201d\n\u201cAw c\u2019mon, can\u2019t we just wait and see if it clears up on its own? You know those pills always mess up my stomach...\u201d\n\u201cDo you know what else will mess up your stomach?\u201d There\u2019s a beat. \u201cSepsis.\u201d\nDick huffs out a short laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re so dramatic. It\u2019s only been infected for a few hours, tops\u2014I highly doubt I\u2019m going into septic shock tonight.\u201d\nBruce grunts. \u201cNot on my watch, you\u2019re not.\u201d There are more rustling sounds. \u201cPut this under your tongue.\u201d\n \u201cB,\u201d he\u00a0groans. \u201cI don\u2019t have a fever.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a beat of silence that Tim would bet his entire trust fund contains a glare, because suddenly Dick is muttering, \u201cFine, alright, alright...\u201d\n\u201cTwo minutes. No talking.\u201d\n\u201cI swear, you use the old fashioned kind just to shut us up.\u201d\n\u201cCorrect. Two minutes.\u201d\nThe only sounds for the next few minutes are a few tiny hisses, the crinkle of gauze wrappers, and the tearing of tape. Tim keeps his breaths as still as possible, feeling more intrusive in this moment than he has in all his years of silent stalking.\u00a0\nHe\u2019s used to seeing the Bats in action, and gradually, he\u2019s also becoming used to seeing the Waynes relaxed at home. But this? This is something different\u2014a strange hybrid of the two. This is Batman and Nightwing dressing an injury, but it\u2019s also Bruce and Dick exasperating the hell out of each other at two o\u2019clock in the morning, and it\u2019s somehow more real than anything Tim\u2019s seen from either of them up until now.\n\u201cTime,\u201d Bruce says quietly. He hums. \u201c99.7. That\u2019s a fever.\u201d\nTim can almost hear Dick\u2019s eye-roll. \u201cNo it\u2019s not. It doesn\u2019t count till it\u2019s over a hundred.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve always run cold. Your average base temperature is four-tenths of a degree below normal. That puts you at 100.1, which is a low-grade fever.\u201d\n\u201cI hope you know it\u2019s creepy that you just know that off the top of your head.\u201d\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\nThe chair scoots again and Tim\u2019s heart drops for a second as he hears footsteps on the tile, but thankfully they\u2019re moving away from him. A cabinet on the other side of the kitchen creaks open, and then the faucet flips on and a glass is filled. There\u2019s the rattle of a pill bottle and then the footsteps move back to the table.\n\u201cAmoxicillin,\u201d Bruce says. \u201cTen days, one pill in the morning, one at night. Don\u2019t skip any. And I want you to stay at the Manor at least until that fever is gone.\u201d\nDick huffs again. \u201cYou mean the fever I don\u2019t have?\u201d There\u2019s another silent beat, then a much quieter, \u201cOkay, fine. Thanks.\u201d\nBruce sighs, but it\u2019s not exasperated this time. Just tired. \u201cAnd next time this happens, will you please come home right away?\u201d\n\u201cYou want me to come over  every time  I get hurt on patrol?\u201d Dick asks with a hint of amusement. \u201cThat much mileage isn\u2019t good for the environment.\u201d\nBruce replies seriously. \u201cFor a black eye? No. But for a bullet wound?  Yes.\u201d \nDick\u2019s tone softens a bit. \u201c...It was just a graze.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Another sigh. \u201cThis time.\u201d\nThey\u2019re both quiet for a bit before Bruce clears his throat. \u201cHonestly, Dick, if you wanted to come home for the black eye too, we wouldn\u2019t say no.\u201d\nDick laughs\u2014a real, genuine laugh. \u201cIs this a subtle jab at my makeup skills?\u201d\n(Silence.)\n\u201cI know,\u201d Dick says softly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u00a0\n(More silence.)\n\u201cI love you too, Dad.\u201d\nEventually, Tim makes it back to his room.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s actually kind of a close call because just as Bruce and Dick finish packing up the first aid supplies, Tim\u2019s stomach lets out a particularly loud growl and the poor boy sees all thirteen years of his life flash before his eyes.\u00a0\nMiraculously, however, the noise is timed perfectly with the sound of a chair scooting heavily across the tile, which then prompts Bruce to grumble something about Dick leaving marks on Alfred\u2019s floor, and then Dick to retort something about how Bruce literally just told him not to lift anything more than ten pounds until the stitches are out and so how else was he supposed to move a solid oak chair, followed by Bruce pointing out he could have just stood up first and then scooted it in, and the two of them continue on like that all the way out of the kitchen.\n\u2026.That\u2019s when Tim finally exhales again.\nAt breakfast the next morning, Dick is looking... Well, let\u2019s just say he\u2019s given up trying to pull off the Perfectly Fine\u2122 act. He shows up ten minutes late, dressed in a hoodie and sweatpants with flushed cheeks and a slight sheen to his forehead. Tim\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019s running hotter than 99.7 now.\nOver his stack of french toast, Jason frowns at him. \u201cAre you sick?\u201d he asks, eliciting only a vague grunt from Dick as he slumps heavily into his seat.\n\u201cHe\u2019s just a little under the weather,\u201d Bruce answers for him without taking his eyes off the newspaper he\u2019s been skimming. \u201cWe\u2019re taking care of it.\u201d\nJason gives the older boy a wary look. \u201cYou\u2019re not contagious, are you?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno,\u201d Dick mutters in a faux-sweet tone as Alfred sets a little dish of yogurt down in front of him. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you scoot closer and we\u2019ll find out?\u201d\n\u201cBoys,\u201d Bruce warns, still not looking up from the paper.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s another thing Tim is learning about the Waynes\u2014none of them are morning people. Even Alfred is more fun after sundown.\nWith a sheepish half-smile, Dick turns to look at Tim. \u201cI\u2019m not actually contagious, I promise,\u201d he assures. \u201cI think I just have an ear infection or something.\u201d\n(Yeah,  or something is right.)\nPlaying along, Tim gives him a sympathetic wince. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, that sucks. Hope you feel better.\u201d\nDick\u2019s smile softens a bit. \u201cThanks, Tim.\u201d Then he turns to Jason, flicking his arm. \u201cSee? That\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to say, you little twerp. Take note.\u201d\nJason makes a rather rude gesture under the table, and Tim has to bite the inside of his cheek to keep from giggling.\nDespite the Manor\u2019s subdued atmosphere, the morning is still pretty enjoyable. Tim and Jason migrate to the den after breakfast to play more Mario Kart, and Dick sprawls out on one of the couches to watch for a while. He tosses out the occasional bit of unsolicited advice, mostly related to Tim\u2019s use of power ups, until he ends up dozing off under the throw blanket.\n\u201cSo what do you wanna do today?\u201d Jason asks as they mash buttons, Dick snoring softly in the background.\nTim shrugs. \u201cI mean, this is fine.\u201d It\u2019s all he\u2019d be doing on any other birthday, anyway, and usually with significantly less company.\nJason rolls his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s your first day as a teenager. You gotta dream bigger, Timmy.\u201d He hurls a shell at Luigi, sending him spinning off the edge of the track. \u201cWe could go somewhere, like the aquarium, or to play paintball, or... hell, I dunno, we could mini golf?\u201d\nTim snorts. \u201cI hate mini golf. It\u2019s just as boring as regular golf, but you don\u2019t even get to do the big swings and drive the cart.\u201d\n\u201cYeah but on the plus side, they don\u2019t make you wear dumb-looking clothes to play,\u201d Jason points out, narrowly dodging the banana peel that Tim shoots behind him. \u201cBut fine, rich boy, no mini golf. Uh... laser tag?\u201d\nTim chews thoughtfully on his lower lip, glancing over at the other couch where Dick is lying on his back with his eyes closed. He\u2019s sure that the Waynes would find a way to make it work if he asked, but it seems unnecessarily complicated to suggest anything too strenuous at the moment. \u201cWe could just do another movie?\u201d\nJason huffs. \u201cAlright, but let\u2019s not wake Sir Talks-A-Lot this time so we can actually  hear  the thing.\u201d\n\u201cM\u2019 awake, you lil\u2019 shit\u2026\u201d Dick murmurs into the cushioned armrest, and Jason chucks a pillow at his head.\nAs they finish up their race circuit, Jason and Tim toss various movie ideas back and forth while Dick offers up the occasional garbled suggestion. They manage to rule the possibilities down to either Jurassic World or Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. Jason is pushing hard for the latter\u2014on account of Tim being the one who hasn\u2019t seen it this time\u2014when Tim\u2019s phone starts buzzing against his leg.\u00a0\nHe pulls it out, frowning when he sees a text from his mother:\u00a0\n\n We just got home. Where are you? \n\nJason pauses the game when he notices Tim staring at the screen. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asks curiously.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s my mom,\u201d Tim murmurs in confusion. \u201cShe says they\u2019re home.\u201d\nNow Jason is frowning too. \u201cWait, did you know they were coming home today?\u201d\nTim shakes his head. It\u2019s only been four days since his parents left; they\u2019ve never come back so soon from a dig. He quickly taps a message back:\u00a0\n\n I\u2019m at the Waynes. Is everything okay? \n\nThree dots flicker on the screen, followed by the response:\u00a0\n\n Come home and see for yourself \n\nTim\u2019s stomach twists anxiously at the words. That could mean  anything.  But if it was something bad, she would have just told him, right? His mother\u2019s not really one to beat around the bush.\nJason leans over to peer at the phone screen, and then snorts a bit. \u201cWell that\u2019s ominous.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s goin\u2019 on?\u201d Dick mumbles without opening his eyes.\u00a0\n\u201cI guess we\u2019re gonna have to watch Honest Abe ice the Cullens another day,\u201d Jason says with a sigh. \u201cTim\u2019s parents are home early.\u201d\n\u201cMm, that\u2019s nice,\u201d Dick hums sleepily. \u201cSurprise party?\u201d\n(Tim nearly bursts out laughing.  That would certainly be the day.)\nJason groans dramatically. \u201cWell, if it was, you just fucking ruined it. Nice going,  Richard...\u201d \n\u201cSorry\u2026\u201d\nSpoiler alert: it\u2019s not a surprise party.\nIn fact, it\u2019s about as far removed from a party as Tim can imagine. Both of his parents are in rather foul moods, and once Tim hears their spiel, he can\u2019t really blame them for it.\u00a0\nAccording to his parents, the Bialiyan government not only waited until they were attempting to make their way through customs to decide that  actually, no, just kidding, you don\u2019t have clearance after all, but when presented with the written permits, proceeded to hold Jack and Janet in custody for thirty-six hours on the suspicion of forged documents.\u00a0\nAt some point, tempers got a little heated, and Jack ended up pinned to the ground by a security guard. To make matters worse, during the struggle he managed to twist his back in such a way that he pinched a nerve and can barely move at the moment, so the fourteen hour flight back had been a  doozy. \n(The Drake family attorney is already on the case.)\nNaturally, Tim is on unpacking duty now, running suitcases up and down the stairs while Janet takes call after call with Drake Industries PR reps, trying to figure out how to keep this whole little debacle out of the press. Meanwhile, Jack reclines in one of the living room\u2019s easy chairs, grumpily giving Tim instructions on where to put things as he alternates between heating and icing his back, and complaining that the Tylenol-Codeine Janet is giving him now doesn\u2019t work nearly as well as whatever that Bialyian doctor at the clinic prescribed.\nJanet argues back that she has no earthly idea what that drug was, and that she\u2019d flushed the rest of the bottle down the airplane toilet when he\u2019d started talking about how he could \u2018see music\u2019 and \u2018smell colors\u2019 and had informed her that a particular mosquito was, quote, \u2018looking at him funny.\u2019\nSince his parents barely even left the terminal, it doesn\u2019t take too long for Tim to finish unpacking\u2014even if he has to do it all by himself in between listening to his dad\u2019s ranting. When he troops back downstairs for the last time, he finds his mother in the living room, curiously peering into the little pouch of dice he\u2019d set on the coffee table.\n\u201cWhat are these, Timothy?\u201d she asks, brow furrowed.\n\u201cOh, they\u2019re just special dice for a game I play,\u201d Tim explains with a shrug. He\u2019s attempted to explain the concept of a tabletop RPG to his parents once before, but they\u2019d looked so bored after only a few minutes that he quickly learned it\u2019s better to just sum things up. \u201cThe Waynes gave them to me for my birthday.\u201d\nJanet\u2019s eyes widen ever so slightly. She sets the pouch back down, immediately pulling out her phone and opening the calendar app.\n\u201cYour birthday?\u201d Now Jack is frowning too. \u201cBut that\u2019s not until the twenty-ninth.\u201d\nTim just barely suppresses an eye-roll. \u201cMy birthday is on the nineteenth, Dad.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Jack says, shaking his head adamantly. \u201cNo, I distinctly remember you being born on the twenty-ninth because I said to the office, \u2018Good thing this isn\u2019t February or he\u2019d be a Leap Baby,\u2019 and then Marge, my secretary at the time, she told me that  she  was a leap baby, and even though she was retiring in a few years,  technically speaking she wasn\u2019t even old enough for her driver\u2019s license. Well, naturally we weren\u2019t going to let Marge live that one down, so the next year everyone at the office chipped in to get her a cake that said \u2018Sweet Sixteen\u2019 and\u2013\u201d\n\u201cIt was the nineteenth, Jack,\u201d Janet interrupts the story, a little exasperatedly. \u201cHe was  due  on the twenty-ninth, but he came ten days early\u2014just before our insurance changed over, remember?\u201d She sighs. \u201cIt was such a hassle trying to get the hospital bills covered after the fact...\u201d\n\u201cOhh yes, that\u2019s right,\u201d Jack recalls. \u201cI was on hold with Blue Cross Blue Shield for three hours before I got an actual human on the line.\u201d\nJanet huffs out a bitter laugh. \u201cI just remember my water breaking in the middle of the chip aisle at the Bristol Target. To this day, I haven\u2019t been back. I have to drive out to the one in Burnside whenever they have a sale\u2026\u201d\n(As Jack and Janet continue to reminisce, Tim tries  really, really hard  not to take it personally that his parents seem to have clearer memories of the inconvenient logistics surrounding his birth than they do of their son entering the world.)\nFinally, Jack turns to him with a little chuckle. \u201cAh well, happy birthday anyway, champ! How does it feel to be fourteen?\u201d\n I wouldn\u2019t know, seeing as I\u2019m thirteen,  is what Tim wants to retort. But the sass isn\u2019t worth risking the fragile improvement to his parents\u2019 moods that catching them off-guard seems to have given him, so he just shrugs.\nHis dad chuckles again. \u201cThat\u2019s alright, you\u2019ll grow into it.\u201d\n\u201cHow about we order Chinese for dinner to celebrate?\u201d Janet suggests, turning to face Tim now. \u201cYou like the eggrolls from Palace Wok best, right?\nTim hates all eggrolls, from any restaurant. He actually isn\u2019t too big on Chinese food in general\u2014it got kind of tainted for him after he threw it up a couple years ago when his parents forgot to specify \u2018no shrimp\u2019 in the fried rice\u2014and he\u2019s mentioned this to them each of the last three times they\u2019ve ordered it. But he knows his mother loves it and she\u2019s trying, dammit, so he just pastes on his best Gala Smile\u2122.\n\u201cSure Mom,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019d be great.\u201d\nHer relieved smile tells him he made the right choice.\nSo.\nTim is sick.\nBut not like, sick-sick. He\u2019s not throwing-up-sick, or can\u2019t-get-out-of-bed-sick, or feverishly-hallucinating-Ms-Sophie-carding-her-fingers-through-his-hair-and-humming-Blackbird-by-The-Beatles-only-to-realize-it\u2019s-just-the-alarm-he-set-on-his-phone-going-off-to-remind-him-it\u2019s-time-for-more-Tylenol-sick.\nThat last one may or may not have happened when he had strep throat back in March.\nBut the important thing is that it\u2019s not happening right now. Right now, Tim is just the normal, average, functional-if-slightly-miserable kind of sick, with a sore throat and a stuffed-up nose and a sinus headache that\u2019s more distracting than it is debilitating.\nSo in other words, he\u2019s basically fine.\nIt\u2019s a chilly Monday in October, the first day back at school following a three-day weekend for a teacher\u2019s in-service. The weather outside is gray and overcast, adding an extra layer to Tim\u2019s general misery.\u00a0\nHe\u2019s late getting up this morning (which is ironic considering the fact that he barely even slept last night), so it takes until his backup,  backup  alarm goes off before he manages to work up the willpower to drag himself out of bed and start getting ready for school. He dresses in his Gotham Academy blazer and khakis, stuffs his feet into some shoes, and trudges down the stairs\u2014pausing briefly on the landing to sneeze three times in quick succession, which makes his stuffed head pound.\nBreakfast isn\u2019t really happening. He\u2019s not nauseous or anything, but his appetite is non-existent and he can\u2019t think of anything he wants to eat that won\u2019t irritate his throat, so he just fills one of Jack\u2019s spare travel mugs with tea to take with him on the city bus. It would have been a good idea, except that he screws the lid on incorrectly and thereby ends up spilling most of it down his the front of his coat when he goes to take a sip.\n(Not even eight a.m. yet and he\u2019s off to a great start.)\nThe school day passes in the usual haze of ringing bells, roll calls, worksheets, and lectures. Tim keeps on functioning: trudging from one class to another, chipping away at whatever work his teachers assign, speaking when spoken to. By the time lunch rolls around, he\u2019s rubbed his nose raw on the scratchy one-ply toilet paper from the boys\u2019 bathroom (and seriously, with the cost of tuition around here, one-ply should be a  crime). He\u2019s just started half-heartedly picking at his breaded chicken sandwich when someone plops down a tray and slides into the seat across from him.\n\u201cWell you sure look like shit,\u201d a cheery voice greets, and Tim glances up tiredly to see\u2013\n...a very beat-up Jason Todd?\nTim blinks at his friend. Jason\u2019s whole left arm is encased in a bright red cast, stretching from his hand all the way up and over the bend in his elbow. His lip is split and one eye is puffy (though the skin is still suspiciously uniform in color\u2014Tim suspects makeup), with a short row of stitches just under his eyebrow. When Jason grins, Tim\u2019s pretty sure he sees a chipped tooth.\nHe blinks again. \u201cYou\u2019re one to talk.\u201d\n\u201cAh, yeah...\u201d Jason gestures nonchalantly at his injuries. \u201cI was hanging out with Dick and a few of his friends over the weekend. Believe it or not, this is all from a pick-up football game that got  wayyy  out of hand\u2026\u201d\nTim absolutely does not believe it. What he does believe, however, is that this is related to the news report he read yesterday of the Titans taking down a kingpin in Star City's illegal drug trade late Saturday night. Multiple sources report that both Nightwing and Robin were spotted amongst the team\u2019s usual members. It also explains why Jason is still smiling about it\u2014which, honestly, is giving Tim secondhand stress because  oh my god, stop it, doesn\u2019t that hurt your face?? Of the relatively few Titans missions that ever become public enough to make the news, this one has easily been the team\u2019s biggest win of the year.\n\u201cBut seriously,\u201d Jason says, his smile fading slightly into a look of mild concern, \u201cyou look wiped. You sick or something?\u201d\nTim shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s just a cold.\u201d He sniffles to prove his point.\nJason wrinkles his nose up. \u201cGross. Are your parents home at least to make you chicken soup?\u201d\nThey\u2019re not, of course. They\u2019re in... Norway? Sweden? Somewhere over there. It\u2019s just a business trip this time, not a dig. Drake Industries is trying to work out a better deal with an international shipping company, so they\u2019ve gone to negotiate with some of the higher ups in... Denmark! That\u2019s where they are.\nTim suddenly realizes Jason is still expecting an answer, so he evades.\u00a0\n\u201cMrs. Mac is coming over this afternoon,\u201d he says with another shrug. \u201cShe\u2019ll make me something.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not a lie. She\u2019ll take one look at Tim, tisk her tongue, and bustle on into the kitchen to whip up some oxtail soup and soda bread while simultaneously talking his ear off about the essential oil multi-level marketing business her daughter-in-law roped her into joining a few months ago. She\u2019s been surprisingly successful with it so far, to the point that Tim wonders how many of her friends and family members are buying the products just to shut her up.\n(If so, he can\u2019t blame them. It\u2019s the reason his bedroom now smells vaguely of eucalyptus.)\n\u201cBut she just stops by, right?\u201d Jason clarifies, stealing a tater tot off Tim\u2019s tray and popping it into his mouth. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t actually stay with you?\u201d\nHis tone is casual, but there\u2019s a slight shift in his features as he moves seamlessly from \u2018friendly banter\u2019 to \u2018subtly gathering information.\u2019 It\u2019s a very Robin move.\nWell, Tim\u2019s going to have to nip that one right in the bud.\n\u201cNo, thank god.\u201d He forces out a croaky little laugh. \u201cI like her\u2014I do. She\u2019s just a bit much, you know? She\u2019s got like twelve all-natural cures for everything, and most of them involve eating raw garlic cloves or drinking cod liver oil straight.\u201d\nOkay, Tim\u2019s exaggerating a little now. Mrs. Mac is more the type to babble on for thirty minutes about the various pseudoscience remedies discussed at last week\u2019s Penny Poker Club meeting than she is to actually force any of them on him. Professional boundaries and all.\u00a0\nBut Jason takes the bait, and that\u2019s all that matters.\n\u201cEugh. Say no more, dude,\u201d he says with an exaggerated shudder. \u201cAlfred had a cod liver oil phase back in the day. Supposed to help with malnutrition or whatever?\u201d He grimaces. \u201cI told him I\u2019d rather be short.\u201d\nThey chat through the rest of the lunch period (\u201cB said I could stay home today, but we\u2019re doing a socratic seminar for The Crucible in English, and bro, I live for that shit\u201d / \u201cWhat, witch burning?\u201d / \u201cNo, the chance to tell fucking Junior Class President  Zachary Feldmore  that his patriarchal opinions are shit\u201d) and the company distracts Tim from his sore throat enough that he gets down most of the remaining tater tots and a few bites of the chicken, which he has to admit does help his overall energy level.\nWhen there are three minutes left before the bell, Tim and Jason both stand up to gather their backpacks and return their trays.\n\u201cWell, if you need anything, you\u2019ve got our numbers,\u201d Jason says casually as they join the mass of students in participating in the daily ritual of crowding the cafeteria doors while the lunch monitors holler \u2018Stop crowding the doors!\u2019 at them. \u201cI\u2019d say we could drive you home, except Alfred\u2019s picking me up early today for an appointment.\u201d\nTim snorts a bit. \u201cDentist?\u201d he guesses before he can remember to pump the brakes.\nJason looks startled. \u201cHow did you know that?\u201d\nWith a sheepish smile, Tim gestures at the other boy\u2019s mouth. \u201cSaw your tooth,\u201d he admits. \u201cMust have been some football game.\u201d\nJason relaxes, huffing out a laugh. \u201cOh you don\u2019t know the half of it, Timmers...\u201d\n Yeah, that\u2019s true,  Tim supposes to himself as the bell rings.  But I\u2019m pretty sure I know more than you\u2019d think\u2026 \nThe pressure in Tim\u2019s sinuses ramps up again soon after lunch, and the rest of the school day passes in... well, not quite a haze, but more of a mush, where he\u2019s definitely present for every moment, but they all sort of blend together into something Tim can only describe as...  blergh. \nBy the time Tim gets home from school, he\u2019s at least three hundred percent more exhausted than normal. He kicks off his shoes by the door and dumps his backpack before trudging into the kitchen. There he finds a note on the counter in Mrs. Mac\u2019s signature looped cursive scrawl.\u00a0\nIt takes a good minute for Tim to get his brain and eyes to work together long enough to decipher the words. Apparently the weather forecast is calling for thunderstorms that evening, with the potential of turning into freezing rain if the temperature continues to drop, so she\u2019d stopped by that morning to stock the fridge and tidy up the place instead of after school like she\u2019d planned.\u00a0\nUnderstandable, Tim supposes. It\u2019s a good thirty minute drive from her little duplex in Burnside out here to Bristol, and she\u2019s definitely getting up there in years. It makes total sense that she wouldn\u2019t want to risk getting stranded somewhere for a grocery run. It just means Tim will be eating ramen noodle soup tonight instead of oxtail, but that\u2019s fine too. He\u2019s not very hungry anyway.\nWith no reason to bother looking presentable anymore, Tim trudges up to his room to change out of his uniform into track pants and a hoodie. It takes so much out of him that by the time he\u2019s done, he\u2019s sorely tempted to lie down for a while on his extremely inviting-looking bed, but he\u2019s got a test for world history tomorrow, which is one of his worst subjects, so he really should study. Especially since Jack is a major history buff and therefore seems to take any less-than-stellar grades Tim gets in that class as a personal offense.\n(Which is kind of ironic considering Jack is  never  around when Tim needs help in the class, but whatever.)\nDragging himself back down to the kitchen, Tim pours a glass of orange juice and takes it with him into the living room. He gets out his backpack and laptop and sets up shop on the couch with the TV tuned to some kind of house flipping show on the Home &amp; Garden network. His mother always complains when she finds him studying with the TV on, but it honestly helps him focus to have the background noise, and it has the added benefit of making the house feel less empty.\u00a0\nWin-win, in Tim\u2019s book.\nHe pulls up his study guide and history notes to start quizzing himself on the information, but it isn\u2019t long before all the names and dates are blurring together before his eyes.\nHis phone chimes with the message from Jason. He opens it to find a selfie of the boy sitting in the passenger seat of Alfred\u2019s town car. Jason is giving a thumbs-up and grinning to show off his newly capped tooth.\u00a0\nTim grins, then types:  Tired of playing Dracula?\u00a0 \n Never,  Jason shoots back.  Just couldn\u2019t pull off the accent \nThe three dots appear to signal Jason is typing. Then three more messages appear in quick succession:\u00a0\n\n Alfie says to let you know he\u2019s prepared a whole soft foods smorgasbord to celebrate my return to the mortal plane \n\n\nYou know, soup, mashed potatoes, pudding, etc\n\n\n We can swing by and pick you up on the way home if you wanna join? \n\nFor a brief second, Tim\u2019s tempted to accept; a bowl of Alfred\u2019s soup sounds heavenly right about now. But then he remembers how gross and snivelly he is at the moment, and how awful he\u2019d feel if he gave Jason his cold on top of everything else. Just the thought of sneezing with facial stitches makes Tim wince in sympathy.\nTim types back:  Thanks but I\u2019m pretty tired. Think I\u2019m gonna take a nap \n No worries,  Jason replies.  Feel better man \nSighing, Tim locks the screen and sets the phone down. He hadn\u2019t actually been planning on sleeping until he\u2019d typed the message, but now it doesn\u2019t seem like a half-bad idea. It\u2019s barely four-thirty in the afternoon, but the sun is already obscured by the dark clouds rolling in, and Tim is so exhausted that he\u2019s hardly comprehending his notes anyway.\nHe sets aside his laptop too. It\u2019s alerting him to low power, but  ugh,  the charger is all the way up in his room. Whatever, he\u2019ll get it later.\u00a0\nTugging the decorative throw blanket down off the back of the couch, Tim wraps it around himself and curls up against the sofa\u2019s armrest. Rain is starting to come down outside now and Tim can hear thunder rumbling in the distance. It isn\u2019t long before the sounds of the storm mix together with the low hum of the TV and Tim drifts off in the light of the glowing screen.\nThe next thing Tim knows, he\u2019s jolting awake to a resounding  CRASH. \nHe jerks upright on the sofa, disoriented to find the living room completely dark now, apart from a few flashes of lightning from the storm raging outside.\n...Or, at least the storm that should be outside. But as Tim fumbles for his phone on the coffee table and flips the flashlight on, he realizes that it\u2019s also partially inside now. Where the massive picture window on the room\u2019s south wall used to be, a thirty-foot branch from the Drakes\u2019 oak tree is lodged in its place.\n\u201cShit...\u201d Tim breathes out, staring at the smashed window and massive tree limb with both horror and awe. His mother\u2019s ornate rug is covered in bits of shattered glass and the Chesterfield leather sofa below the window is quickly becoming soaked as gusts of wind bring the freezing rain pelting inside.\nThis is... this is bad. This is disaster bad. This is break-out-the-international-phone-numbers bad. This is Tim\u2019s-parents-are-going-to-flip-their-shit bad. This is\u2013\n\n\"Do you think you can handle being the man of the house for us, sport?\"\n\nSomewhere in the back of Tim\u2019s head, he can still hear Jack\u2019s question. Ms. Clemmings\u2014Tim\u2019s frankly  terrible  nanny at the time who had hated children, smoked like a chimney, and enjoyed nothing more than criticizing little Timmy for just about everything he did\u2014fell and broke her hip two days before his parents\u2019 long-anticipated trip to Seoul, leaving them in a bind. Rather than dragging Tim along with them for eight days of business negotiations, or canceling what promised to be a very lucrative deal for Drake Industries, Jack and Janet were entertaining for the first time the idea of letting Tim stay home alone.\nAt nine years old, Tim had been eager to prove himself\u2014and even more eager to avoid getting saddled with another Ms. Clemmings anytime soon. He\u2019d dove head-first into his new role, memorizing the city bus schedule to get himself to and from school, keeping up with his homework, fixing his own simple meals, and keeping Drake Manor so spotless that even his parents couldn\u2019t find a single thing to complain about.\u00a0\n\"Well done, sport,\u201d Jack had told him upon their return, clapping his son on the back jovially. \u201cLooks like you handled everything just fine.\"\nThat was four years ago now. Tim\u2019s filled the role of man of the house countless times since then, and he likes to think he\u2019s gotten pretty good at it. Thanks to the power of YouTube tutorials, he's figured out how to unclog a shower drain, how to relight a water heater, and how to reset a circuit breaker. He is  resourceful  and  responsible  and  mature, and if he could handle everything up until now, then he can handle this too.\nHe\u2019s going to be fine. He just needs a plan. He needs\u2013\nAnother gust of wind blows through the gaping hole in the wall, this time strong enough that it takes several of the priceless artifacts on a nearby floating shelf along with it. They crash to the ground, shattering on impact, and that\u2019s enough to kick Tim\u2019s lagging brain back into action.\u00a0\n Damage control,  he decides as he jumps to his feet, lurching towards the window.  Step one is damage control. \nFor the next thirty minutes, Tim races back and forth across the living room, hopping over branches and shards of broken glass to evacuate as many of his parents\u2019 prized possessions as he can manage. Most of the pieces he\u2019s never handled before in his life. It\u2019s been strictly drilled into his head since childhood that \"these are for looking at and not for touching, Timothy.\"\n(The irony of the situation doesn\u2019t escape him.)\nWith each trip, Tim racks his brain, desperately trying to come up with a plan. He\u2019s seen enough hurricane segments on the Weather Channel to know that the window should be boarded up, but where on earth does one get a board from? That\u2019s not something his parents just have lying around. He\u2019s going to have to buy one from somewhere. The hardware store, maybe? Is that even still open? Between the power outage and Tim\u2019s totally disorienting afternoon nap, he doesn\u2019t have the faintest idea what time it is.\u00a0\nThen there\u2019s the fact that even if he had a board, he still couldn\u2019t do anything until the tree was out of the way. And there\u2019s no way Tim\u2019s going to be able to move a tree himself. At least not without a chainsaw, and even he has to admit that seems a little out of his league. So that means he needs to call someone.\nOkay, but who?\u00a0\nMrs. Mac?\nEven if Mrs. Mac could get over here in the storm, unless she\u2019s secretly a super-strength meta, he can\u2019t imagine a seventy-whatever-year-old lady is going to be of much help. She might know who to call, though\u2026 The city, perhaps? But it's not like they could send someone out here anytime soon.\nHe should probably get a tarp or something to block off the window in the meantime. But do the Drakes even own a tarp? Where would they keep that? The garage? The attic? The shed?\u00a0\nTim\u2019s starting to feel a little lightheaded. There\u2019s gotta be some kind of internet forum for this, right? Like a \u2018help a tree just smashed through my window and everything is getting ruined and also where does a thirteen-year-old procure a chainsaw\u2019 subreddit or something? Maybe he should just sit down and pull out his phone and start googling what to do if\u2013\nHis phone is dead.\nTim blinks stupidly at the black screen, his brain spinning in place like the rainbow wait cursor on a hung Macbook. He must have left the flashlight on while it was in his pocket, which was an extremely stupid thing to do considering the power is out.\u00a0\nHe runs a hand shakily through his hair. If his phone is dead, he needs to charge it. But he can\u2019t charge it if the power is out. So he first needs to get the power back on, which means he needs to call the power company\u2013\n\u2026which he can\u2019t do if his phone is dead.\nHot, frustrated tears spring to Tim\u2019s eyes. This is too much. It\u2019s all too much. \u00a0\nHe steps out into the hallway and leans his back against the wall, sinking down to the floor with his knees pulled up to his chest. He doesn\u2019t know how to deal with this\u2014he can\u2019t  deal with this. But that doesn\u2019t matter, because he  has to  deal with it.\u00a0\nHe doesn\u2019t have a choice.\nFor one full minute, Tim just sits there, letting the tears slide down his cheeks unhindered. His head is pulsing and his clothes are soaked through and he\u2019s sweaty and shivering at the same time and he longs more than anything to just ignore this whole mess and curl up in his bed and deal with it all tomorrow.\u00a0\nAnd then his minute is up.\nWith a deep, shuddery inhale, Tim sits up straight and scrubs the tears away with his sleeve because he is the  man of the house, goddammit, and the man of the house isn\u2019t going to sit blubbering on the floor about a silly little tree branch.\nHe needs a phone, and he knows where he can find one.\u00a0\nHe\u2019s going to fix this.\nThanks to the storm\u2014which is rapidly shifting to freezing rain and sleet as the temperature drops further\u2014the mile-long walk to Wayne Manor takes almost thirty minutes. Tim spends the first five or so trying to formulate a plan of action for once the power is back on, but he\u2019s cold and his head is aching and his thoughts are jumbled, so he gives up before too long and just focuses his energy on not slipping on the ice.\nAt somewhere around the half-mile mark, Tim starts to second-guess his decision to come. The Waynes already seem wary of Tim\u2019s living situation; what if they take this as proof that he can\u2019t actually handle living on his own? What if they end up confronting his parents about it and they get in trouble?\u00a0\nOr worse, what if Tim ends up with another Ms. Clemmings?\nHe can\u2019t let that happen\u2014not now. Not when he\u2019s already used to the freedom of staying home alone and making his own choices. Tim is just going to have to make it clear to the Waynes that he\u2019s handling this. He\u2019s here to borrow some electricity and make a few calls, that\u2019s all. He doesn\u2019t need help\u2014he needs an outlet. A literal, three-pronged, electrical outlet.\u00a0\nThis is just the modern day equivalent of borrowing a cup of sugar.\nThat\u2019s what he tells himself as makes his way up the Manor\u2019s icy front steps. He can do this. He\u2019s allowed to do this. He\u2019s not being a baby. He\u2019s being resourceful. He\u2019s handling this.\nTim takes a deep breath and presses the doorbell.\nThen there are muffled footsteps and a holler of \u201cI got it Alfie!\u201d and then before Tim gets the chance to change his mind, the door swings open to reveal an utterly dumbfounded-looking Jason.\n\u201cTim?\u201d He cranes his neck to look beyond him out the door as if searching for something. \u201cHoly shit, did you walk here?\u201d he demands. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call?\u201d\nTim huffs out a bitter little laugh at the irony, and he can see it there in the frosty air. \u201cWell, that\u2019s kind of the problem actually,\u201d he starts to explain. \u201cI\u2019m here to\u2013\u201d\nJason isn\u2019t listening. \u201cOh my god, you fucking walked here\u2026\u201d he mutters, pinching the bridge of his nose in a very Bruce-like gesture. Then he whips his head back up. \u201cB!\u201d he turns to shout over his shoulder. \u201cB, it\u2019s Tim! He  walked here!\u201d\n\u201cOh, no it\u2019s no big deal, I\u2019m okay,\u201d Tim says quickly as Jason grabs his arm and pulls him into the foyer, shutting the door behind them. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to bother everyone, I just need\u2013\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cTim?\u201d There\u2019s the sound of hurried footsteps, and then Bruce comes jogging into view, his face painted with concern. \u201cAre you alright? What happened, bud? Why didn\u2019t you call?\u201d\nOkay, so this is  way  more attention than Tim was expecting and it\u2019s frankly a little overwhelming. He takes a deep breath to steady himself.\u00a0\n\n Just stick to the facts, Tim. \n\n\u201cMy power\u2019s out,\u201d he admits, and Bruce immediately winces in sympathy, \u201cso I need to call the company, but my phone is dead, so\u2013\u201d\nJason holds up a hand. \u201cWait, hang on, lemme get this straight. You\u2019re home alone, your power went out,  and  your phone died?\u201d\nTim bobs his head. \u201cRight but that\u2019s not the point, I just need to\u2013\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOh good heavens.\u201d Alfred suddenly materializes, drawing in a sharp breath at the sight of his young guest. \u201cI\u2019ll fetch some dry clothes right away,\u201d he announces, already spinning on his heel.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cOh no, please don\u2019t bother,\u201d Tim calls after him. \u201cI can\u2019t stay long anyway, I just really need to plug in my phone so I can call the power company.\u201d\n\u201cTim.\u201d Bruce\u2019s concerned expression deepens. He drops down onto one knee to look Tim in the eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re soaking wet and you\u2019re shaking, bud. We can call ComEd for you in a few minutes. Let\u2019s just start by getting you into dry clothes and warmed up before we-\u201d\n\u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand.\u201d Tim\u2019s pitch is increasing right along with his frustration level because  no one is listening to him.  \u201cI can\u2019t stay, okay? I need to get back home because a branch fell and it smashed a window so there\u2019s glass everywhere and my parents\u2019 stuff is getting ruined and\u2013\u201d\n\u201cTimmy!\u201d Jason balks in disbelief. \u201cWhat kind of  unholy deity  did you piss off to\u2013\u201d\n\u201cJay,\u201d Bruce grounds out, shooting his son a Look that makes his mouth snap shut. Then he turns back to Tim, eyes sharp and worried. \u201cAre you hurt anywhere?\u201d he asks seriously.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Tim\u2019s feeling completely overwhelmed now. \u201cNo, I-I\u2019m fine. I just need to charge my phone so I can call the city or\u2013 or someone else to come out.\u201d He sucks in a breath. \u201cBut I can do it myself, okay? I\u2026 I can do it.\u201d\nBruce opens his mouth like he\u2019s going to say something, but Tim doesn\u2019t let him.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m handling it.\u201d The words come out choked thanks to Tim\u2019s tightening throat. \u201cI can handle it, really, just let me\u2026 h\u2026handle\u2013\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cTim,\u201d Bruce tries again, softer.\nTears start spilling down Tim\u2019s cheeks and his breath hitches. He shakes his head, scrubbing them away roughly with his palms. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m not hurt, I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m cr...crying, I...\u201d\n\u201c...Master Tim?\u201d The voice, though gentle, startles Tim. He looks up to see that Alfred has returned already, several fluffy towels folded neatly in his arms. His brow is furrowed with concern, but his eyes hold nothing but kindness. \u201cMay I?\u201d\nTim isn\u2019t sure what Alfred is asking permission for, but he nods anyway. It\u2019s impossible not to trust the man.\nPassing the stack of towels off to Jason, Alfred unbuttons the cuff of his own right sleeve. He slides the material up just enough to expose his forearm, and then, before Tim even registers what\u2019s happening, he\u2019s pressing the inside of his wrist gently against the boy\u2019s forehead.\n\u201cMm,\u201d Alfred hums after a brief moment, giving him a sad sort of smile. \u201cThis is why, my dear boy.\u201d\nIt takes a few seconds for Tim\u2019s lagging brain to connect the answer to his previous question. \u201cOh,\u201d he says when it clicks. And then just like that, Tim covers his face with his hands and completely falls apart. \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t think I can h...handle this,\u201d he sobs.\n\u201cThat\u2019s quite alright, lad,\u201d Alfred says kindly as he pulls Tim\u2019s dripping wet frame into a surprisingly solid hug. \u201cYou\u2019re not alone. You needn\u2019t anymore.\u201d\n101.1.\nThat\u2019s what Tim\u2019s fever is at, once Alfred ushers him into the bathroom and produces an actual thermometer to check. It\u2019s hardly anything to get worked up about, Tim thinks, but Jason makes a little wince of sympathy when the number is reported.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a cold,\u201d Tim mutters. He\u2019s sitting on top of the closed toilet lid, hunched forward with his elbows resting on his knees so he can support his aching head with his hands. His little bout of crying has only increased the pressure in his head, and he\u2019s wondering dully at what point it will just explode.\n\u201cBased on your symptoms, I believe it\u2019s more likely to be a sinus infection,\u201d Alfred corrects gently, and yeah, okay, that tracks.\n\u201cOof,\u201d Jason says. \u201cThose always suck.\u201d\nTim makes a small, non-committal noise in his throat. \u201cHad worse.\u201d\n\u201cThat is of little consolation, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d Alfred says with a sigh.\nTim hums tiredly. He\u2019s been so hyped up on adrenaline for the last hour that he hadn\u2019t even noticed how exhausted he was, but as soon as he finally accepted that the Waynes were taking over his disaster mitigation duties, he\u2019d basically crashed.\nRight now, Bruce is over at Drake Manor doing... Tim doesn\u2019t even know what. But he\u2019d seen him take a bunch of tarps and plywood with him, and he\u2019d had a very determined expression on his face, so Tim figures he\u2019s got some kind of plan. Jason offered to go with him, but Bruce turned him down on account of his arm, leaving the teenager hovering awkwardly in the bathroom doorway.\u00a0\nThe friendly concern is nice and all, but between Tim\u2019s pounding headache and all the humiliating sobbing he just did, an audience is about the last thing in the world he wants.\nAs if reading his mind, Alfred clears his throat. \u201cI do believe a fire in the family room hearth is in order,\u201d he says casually as he reaches around Tim to flip on the shower. \u201cDo you feel up to starting one, Master Jason, or would your injuries preclude you?\u201d\u00a0\nJason\u2019s eyebrows raise. \u201cIs that a challenge?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s merely an inquiry, sir,\u201d Alfred replies in his most innocent tone. He hangs a particularly plush bath towel on the heated rack. \u201cMaster Dick has always been quite adept at accomplishing tasks one-handed, but if it proves too difficult, it\u2019s no matter. I shall be out momentarily.\u201d\nJason looks utterly offended. \u201cIf Dick can do it, I can do it,\u201d he declares, already halfway out of the room.\n\u201cThough under no circumstances are you to use your teeth to hold the match,\u201d Alfred calls after him, and Tim can hear Jason\u2019s annoyed groan of  \u2018I know, I know,\u2019  float back down the hall.\nUnder his breath, Alfred adds, \u201cOne would think that would be implied, but experience has shown it\u2019s best to spell these things out.\u201d\nTim huffs out a little laugh. \u201cDick?\u201d he guesses.\nAlfred shakes his head, sighing in a way that seems to age him at least a decade. \u201cA young Master Bruce, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d he admits. \u201cIt was several months until he regrew that eyebrow\u2026\u201d\nBy the time Tim shuffles into the family room, freshly showered and dressed in a pair of borrowed pajamas, not only has Jason managed to start a fire, but he\u2019s still in possession of both his eyebrows and seems pretty smug about it.\n\u201cYou look better,\u201d Jason remarks, grabbing a couple of fuzzy blankets from a wicker basket near the fireplace. \u201cLess icicle, more human. Always good.\u201d\n Yeah, you should know,  Tim thinks with a snort as he makes his way to the couch, recalling a few months prior when he\u2019d witnessed Robin falling victim to Mr. Freeze\u2019s ice gun on a weeknight patrol. Batman had been able to counteract the effects with some kind of chemical spray a few minutes later, but the whole incident had brought an abrupt end to the evening. Tim watched him wrap a very pissed-off Robin tightly in his cape before forcing him back into the Batmobile.\n(To be fair, Jason\u2019s repeated arguments that he was  one hundred percent totally fine, lemme at him  would have likely been more effective had his teeth not been chattering so hard that Tim could plainly hear them from his hiding spot behind a nearby dumpster.)\n\u201cBruce is still over at your place,\u201d Jason goes on, knocking Tim back to the present moment. \u201cHe says you kinda downplayed this \u2018branch\u2019 thing\u201d\u2014he makes air quotes around the term\u2014\u201cand it\u2019s really more like  your entire tree  that\u2019s down.\u201d\nTim shrugs half-heartedly, sitting down on the sofa. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s not a very  big  tree...\u201d\n\u201cSure, Timmy.\u201d Rolling his eyes, Jason chucks a blanket his way. \u201cAnyway, the tarps aren\u2019t gonna cut it, so he\u2019s waiting on a buddy with a chainsaw.\u201d\nTim blinks.\u00a0\n\n Batman has a buddy with a chainsaw?? \n\nPicking up on Tim\u2019s surprise, Jason snorts. \u201cI know, right? Hard to believe B has friends,\u201d he deadpans. \u201cAnyway, he\u2019ll be back as soon as he can, and in the meantime, you\u2019re just supposed to chill out and warm up and watch mindless reality TV because he\u2019s totally got this covered, okay?\u201d\nTim\u2019s feeling about the furthest thing from \u2018chilled out\u2019 at the moment, but he does warm up and he does watch some mindless TV as he eats the soup Alfred brings him. Jason starts them out with Ice Road Truckers, then ends up changing the channel to Kitchen Nightmares once he decides the former is a little too on the nose for tonight. Tim curls up under a blanket and tries not to dwell on how guilty he feels about the massive inconvenience he\u2019s being.\nIt\u2019s just after eight p.m. now, and while Robin no doubt had the night off to recover, Batman still goes out solo sometimes. What if he\u2019d been planning to patrol tonight, and now is stuck on branch clearing duty instead? Does that mean Tim is indirectly responsible for all the crimes that will go unhindered tonight? All because he couldn\u2019t figure out a solution that didn\u2019t involve bothering  literal superheroes  over his own stupid problems?\nWhen the soup is gone, Alfred clears the dishes away. Then he returns a few minutes later with a little medicine cup full of berry-flavored NyQuil\u2014or knockout juice, as Tim grew up knowing it as.\u00a0\n\u2026It\u2019s possible that he spent a fair amount of his early childhood zonked out on the stuff whenever his nannies\u2019 days off happened to coincide with Jack and Janet\u2019s important business calls.\nThe good news is, the medicine works just as well as it always has.\nTim\u2019s out in twenty minutes flat.\n\u201c...Hey bud?\u201d\nFor the second time that night, Tim finds himself jolting awake with a gasp. Bruce is kneeling in front of the couch, holding his hands in front of himself in a non-threatening gesture.\n\u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t mean to startle you,\u201d he whispers. \u201cI just wanted to make sure that you and Jason got to bed okay. I\u2019d let you sleep here, but I don\u2019t want you to get sore necks.\u201d\n\u201cOh, no it\u2019s fine,\u201d Tim mumbles, sitting up. Over on the other end of the sofa, Jason is fast asleep, his breaths rising and falling in a steady rhythm while Gordon Ramsey verbally berates a restaurant owner on the TV for serving week-old tuna steaks. \u201cWhat time \u2019s it? Late?\u201d\nBruce\u2019s lips twitch into a small smile. \u201cIt\u2019s not even ten. I think Jason\u2019s just exhausted from the weekend still. School today was a bit of a push for him.\u201d\nTim hums a bit. That makes sense. Tim would be pretty wiped too after taking down a bunch of drug lords.\n\u201cMy friend Clark and I moved the branch and boarded up the window, and the power\u2019s back on now, so everything\u2019s taken care of at your place,\u201d he goes on. \u201cWe also cleaned up the glass and took some pictures for your parents\u2019 insurance claims. I emailed them over a few minutes ago.\u201d\nTim lowers his gaze guiltily. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you had to deal with all that,\u201d he mutters, picking at a piece of fuzz on his blanket. \u201cI could\u2019ve at least picked up the glass before I came over.\u201c\u00a0\n(And been the one to email Jack and Janet. They have the tendency to shoot the messenger upon receiving bad news, and Tim really doesn\u2019t want Bruce in the middle of that\u2014especially not after going out of his way to be so helpful.)\nBruce\u2019s brow furrows. \u201cWhat? No, Tim, you did more than enough, okay?\u201d he assures. \u201cSomething like this would be overwhelming for most adults to deal with, let alone a thirteen-year-old.\u201d\nOkay, now that\u2019s a bit offensive. Tim\u2019s been taking care of himself just fine for years. He frowns. \u201cI\u2019m not some helpless kid, it\u2019s just that the power was out,\u201d he argues. \u201cIf you\u2019d have just let me charge my phone, I would\u2019ve figured everything out eventually. I always do.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re definitely not helpless,\u201d Bruce is quick to agree. \u201cYou\u2019re a very responsible and resourceful person.\u201d He sighs. \u201cBut Tim... you  are  still a kid. There\u2019s no reason you should have had to deal with this all on your own.\u201d\nWell, that\u2019s a bunch of bull. Obviously someone had to deal with it, and seeing as Tim was the only one home, then that someone had to be him. It\u2019s hardly rocket science. But Tim\u2019s head is throbbing and he\u2019s too tired to argue properly right now, so he just huffs out a little breath of air instead.\nBruce\u2019s expression softens. \u201cWe can talk more about it in the morning. For now, let\u2019s just get you boys off to bed.\u201d\nThat sounds like a plan Tim can get behind. He\u2019s so freaking tired. School tomorrow is going to be a struggle, he can already tell.\u00a0\nBruce helps lever Tim to his feet, holding on for an extra moment once he\u2019s upright as if making sure Tim won\u2019t topple one way or the other. Once he\u2019s satisfied, he moves over to Jason and shakes his shoulder gently.\u00a0\n\u201cJay,\u201d he whispers. \u201cTime to go to sleep, chum.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018S what \u2018m doin'...\u201d Jason mumbles, swatting his hand away without even opening his eyes. \u201cGo \u2018way, old man.\u201d\n\u201cIn your real bed,\u201d Bruce clarifies.\u00a0\nTim watches in vague amusement as the older boy rolls over, burying his face further into the sofa pillow. \u201cBed\u2019s a social construct,\u201d he murmurs sleepily.\u00a0\n\u201cActually, bed is a four thousand dollar memory foam mattress.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018Course you\u2019d say that, Mr. McOnePercent...\u201d\nTim giggles at that, but Bruce just rolls his eyes. \u201cJason, if you need me to carry you, I will. But know that that means no school tomorrow, since it obviously took too much out of you today.\u201d\n\u201cOh heck no.\u201d Jason bolts upright, wadding up his blanket and chucking it across the room into the wicker basket as he gets to his feet. \u201cTomorrow\u2019s day two of the socratic, and Zachary Feldmore is going  down.\u201d \nRather than his usual guest room on the first floor, Bruce guides Tim upstairs to the spare room across from Jason\u2019s in the family corridor. His reasoning is that it\u2019ll be more convenient to have Tim on the same level as them just in case he wakes up feeling worse and needs more medicine or something during the night.\u00a0\n(Which is absurd of course because Tim\u2019s not five and he can take care of himself, but whatever. At least the mattress is really comfortable.)\n\u201cTissues and water are right here on the nightstand,\u201d Bruce says as Tim crawls up into bed. There are at least seven pillows, so he has to burrow in a bit. \u201cAnd there\u2019s an extra blanket by the foot of the bed if you get cold. Do you need anything else?\u201d\nTim\u2019s about to say no thank you on reflex before he remembers there is actually something he needs. \u201cUm, did you happen to grab my school uniform from home by any chance?\u201d\nEven if Jason had a spare he could borrow, it would be too big on Tim, so there\u2019s really no point. Gotham Academy is nothing if not strict on dress code. He once saw a girl get sent home for wearing the wrong  socks. \nAt Bruce\u2019s furrowed brow, Tim quickly adds, \u201cIt\u2019s totally fine if you didn\u2019t! It\u2019s my fault I didn\u2019t think to ask before. I\u2019ll just have to set my alarm a little earlier so I can run home and grab it in the morning, no big deal.\u201d\nBruce sighs softly. \u201cTim, you\u2019re not going to school tomorrow,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re sick, and you\u2019ve had a pretty rough night on top of that.\u201d\nNow it\u2019s Tim\u2019s turn to frown in confusion. \u201cWhat? But I have to go.\u201d He doesn\u2019t even feel that bad\u2014he\u2019d felt  worse  back in March with the strep, and that certainly hadn\u2019t stopped him from attending school.\u00a0\n(Well, until he wasn\u2019t conscious anymore. But he\u2019d attended all the way up until that!)\n\u201cYou have a fever,\u201d Bruce points out.\nTim flaps a hand dismissively. \u201cIt\u2019s not even a high one. It\u2019ll probably be gone by the morning.\u201d\u00a0\n(And if it isn\u2019t, that\u2019s what ibuprofen is for. This is hardly Tim\u2019s first rodeo.)\n\u201cIt might be,\u201d Bruce allows, \u201cbut even if it is, the fact that you have a fever  now  means you can\u2019t go to school for at least twenty-four hours since you might still be contagious.\u201d\nTim actually snorts out loud at that. \u201cThat\u2019s just a myth.\u201d\n\u201c...A myth?\u201d Bruce quirks an eyebrow.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Tim says, recalling what Janet told him time and time again growing up. \u201cIt\u2019s just something the school tells parents so they don\u2019t end up with whiny kids clogging up the nurse\u2019s office. But I know better than to do that, so it\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\"Because you\u2019re a big boy now, isn\u2019t that right, Timothy?\" Janet had reminded her little third-grader as she\u2019d ushered him out of the shower and into his school clothes. Tim had woken up in a puddle of sweat that morning, his fever finally having broken after two solid days of flu. \"You\u2019re going back to school today, and I\u2019m going to close that deal with Ren Corp at eleven, and then I\u2019ll get us both ice cream on the way home to celebrate, hm? Doesn\u2019t that sound nice?\"\nAnd Tim  had  been a big boy. He\u2019d made it through the entire school day  and managed to eat half his ice cream cone before nodding off into the rest, getting melted chocolate all over his dry clean only blazer.\u00a0His mother hadn\u2019t even been too upset about it. She\u2019d just sighed and ordered him a new one.\n\u201cWould you like to see the school policy?\u201d Bruce asks, holding out his phone.\u00a0\nFrowning, Tim takes the device to see that Bruce has pulled up a PDF of Gotham Academy's student handbook from their website. He scrolls down past the paragraphs on uniform requirements and appropriate student conduct all the way to a section marked \u2018Health and Wellness.\u2019\n Huh.  Well would you look at that. It\u2019s right there in the rules. Right after \u2018all medications, whether prescription or over the counter, may ONLY be distributed by the nurse on duty.\u2019\n Well that\u2019s ridiculous,  Tim thinks, recalling the 200-count bottle of ibuprofen Jack had bought him this year as part of his standard school supplies. Next thing they\u2019re going to say is he isn\u2019t allowed to puke in the bathroom and then come back to class.\n(Oh shit. That\u2019s the next line.)\nTim closes out of the tab. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got a history test tomorrow,\u201d he says as he passes the phone back to Bruce. \u201cAnd I bombed my last one, so I really need to do well on it.\u201d\u00a0\nOkay, technically he\u2019d gotten a 79 on the last test, but according to Jack Missed-His-Calling-as-an-Eccentric-Community-College-History-Professor Drake, that\u2019s basically a fail.\n\u201cAs long as your absence is excused, your teacher has to let you make up the test,\u201d Bruce assures. \u201cThat\u2019s  also school policy.\u201d At Tim\u2019s skeptical look, he adds, \u201cWe can even get you a doctor\u2019s note if it\u2019d make you more comfortable.\u201d\nA doctor\u2019s note? For a glorified head cold? Heck no. The ER visit was mortifying enough\u2014there is no way he\u2019s going to make Bruce Freaking Wayne take time out of his day to drag Tim to a doctor so he can get a note to excuse his  sniffles. \n\u201cNo, that\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t need a note,\u201d Tim says quickly. He can\u2019t even remember the last time he went to the doctor. Would he still go to a pediatrician, or is that more of a twelve-and-under thing, like ordering off a kid\u2019s menu? Tim sure doesn\u2019t know.\nBruce nods. \u201cAlright, we\u2019ll see how you\u2019re feeling in the morning. I\u2019m sure our family\u2019s doctor could get you in if needed. But either way, can we at least agree that you\u2019ll be staying home from school?\u201d\nIt\u2019s spoken like a question, but Tim\u2019s been around adults enough to know that it isn\u2019t one. Not really. It\u2019s more of a very politely-worded order. And Tim knows better than to argue with orders, no matter how nice they sound.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Tim murmurs at his lap. \u201cIf you think that\u2019s best.\u201d\nHe\u2019s not sure why that response only makes Bruce sigh deeper. \u201cI do, bud. I really do.\u201d\nSo that\u2019s that.\nIt\u2019s a little after five a.m. when Tim\u2019s phone starts ringing. He doesn\u2019t even have to look at the caller ID to know who it will be. He just sits up against the headboard, takes a deep breath, and accepts the call.\n\u201cHi, Mom,\u201d he whispers.\n\u201cTimothy.\u201d Janet\u2019s voice is so chillingly calm that for a moment, Tim isn\u2019t sure which way this is going to go. \u201cDo you know why your father and I shell out a hundred and ninety-five dollars a month to maintain our international phone plans  on top of our domestic plans?\u201d\n(Ah. It\u2019s going that way.)\n\u201cUm\u2026 in case there\u2019s an emergency?\u201d he mumbles.\n\u201cCorrect,\u201d she confirms. Her tone is so icy it could give Victor Fries a run for his money. \u201cAnd do you know what thousands of dollars worth of property damage, not to mention the loss of  dozens  of  irreplaceable, priceless artifacts counts as?\u201d\nHe winces. \u201cAn emergency?\u201d\n\u201cOne would think so, wouldn\u2019t they,\u201d Janet says flatly. \u201cSo why, pray tell, are we paying a hundred and ninety-five dollars a month to find out about this emergency via an  email from Bruce Wayne  and not a phone call from our own son?\u201d\n\u201cI just thought\u2026\u201d Tim swallows hard. It makes his throat ache. \u201cI mean, it was really late for you guys when it happened, and I was handling it, so\u2013\u201d\n \u201cHandling it?  You thought you were  handling it?\u201d  Janet\u2019s volume is getting progressively louder. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the photos Mr. Wayne sent\u2014do you have any idea how many of one-of-a-kind, historical pieces are now  hopelessly water-damaged?  And how many of those could have probably been  saved  with just a bit of guidance?\u201d\nOkay, this isn\u2019t fair\u2014they weren\u2019t  here. \u201cI was trying to save what I could, I swear. It was just all happening really fast and I\u2019m kind of sick so it was hard to think, and\u2013\u201d\n\u201cThen you should have  called us,\u201d Janet cuts him off sharply. \u201cWe could have helped you to prioritize. Helped you triage. Told you how to properly dry out some of those first editions before the ink bled into the pages! We might have saved your father\u2019s Chesterfield sofa\u2014do you know how much it\u2019s going to cost to reupholster that by the way?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2013\u201d\n\u201cNo, you must not have, because it doesn\u2019t look like you even  attempted  to salvage it before running off to the neighbors! Timothy, you saved a thirty-five dollar vase and left an eighteenth-century handcrafted Indian tapestry hanging on the wall! If you had just bothered to  call us,\u00a0we could have\u2013\u201d\n\u201cBut I  couldn\u2019t  call,\u201d Tim interrupts, thoroughly frustrated now. \u201cMy phone was dead and the power was out! That\u2019s why I left, I had to\u2013\u201d\n\u201cTimothy,\u201d\u00a0she snaps. \u201cWe have a  landline!\"\nOh fuck.\nThat\u2019s right.\u00a0\nThe Drakes  do have a landline. It\u2019s hanging right on the kitchen wall, rotary dial and spiral cord and all.\nTim\u2019s an utter moron.\n\u201cI\u2026 I forgot,\u201d he whispers in horror. \u201cWe never use it. I didn\u2019t think...\u201d\nJanet is speaking away from the phone now, her tone exasperated:  \u201cHe says he forgot we own a telephone.\u201d \nTim can just make out his dad\u2019s sarcastic mutter:  \u201cGood to know we\u2019re paying thirty thousand dollars a year for that elite private education.\u201d\u00a0 \nThe words might as well be a punch in the gut. What do his parents even want from him? They tell him to be independent and use his resources and not bother them when they\u2019re busy, but then when he tries to do precisely that, they make him feel stupid for not asking for help. How the hell is Tim supposed to know when something is \u2018big enough\u2019 for them to care or not when they\u2019re constantly changing the rules on him?\u00a0\u00a0\nThe conversation shifts after that to logistics, with his parents going back and forth with each other about booking flights home and contacting restoration experts and filing insurance claims and so on. Tim stays on the line the whole time, but he zones out after a while, curling back up on his side under the covers. It doesn\u2019t matter really; they\u2019re not talking to him anymore.\nHe\u2019s not sure they ever really were.\nOn the fourth Monday of November, Tim\u2019s parents inform him that they\u2019ll be coming home for Thanksgiving.\nWell, technically the email states that they\u2019re coming home because their business negotiations in D\u00fcsseldorf just so happen to be wrapping up on Wednesday evening, and they\u2019ve booked a flight back that should put them in Gotham by Thursday afternoon, but Tim will take what he can get. It\u2019ll be the first time his parents have been in town for this particular holiday since he was in fourth grade, and unless their schedule changes\u2014which, granted, is always a possibility\u2014it looks like they\u2019ll be staying all the way through Hanukkah.\u00a0\nNow, Tim\u2019s not naive. He knows that regardless of what the calendar says, his parents will be too jet-lagged and exhausted from their travels to have any sort of celebration on their minds, but that doesn\u2019t mean they wouldn\u2019t still appreciate a nice dinner if it were already prepared for them. So that\u2019s Tim\u2019s plan: give Mrs. Mac a grocery list, watch a few recipe tutorials, and crank out a modest holiday feast just in time for his parents\u2019 arrival.\nOr, that is Tim\u2019s plan, anyway, until he mentions it to Jason during lunch on Wednesday (if it can even be called \u2018lunch\u2019 when it occurs at 9:16 in the morning due to their weird pre-holiday half-day schedule).\n\u201cHuh. Well that sounds... ambitious,\u201d Jason remarks, mulling this information over as he unwraps a granola bar. \u201cDon\u2019t take this the wrong way, but\u2026 have you ever cooked before?\u201d\nTim stares at his friend, incredulous. What kind of question is that? Tim\u2019s been fixing his own meals and snacks since before he could even see over the countertops.\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean like, making yourself a sandwich or pasta or whatever, I know you do that all the time,\u201d Jason quickly clarifies. \u201cI mean, have you ever cooked an entire holiday dinner before? With a turkey and side dishes and dessert and all that?\u201d\nTim crosses his arms, a little defensively. While it\u2019s true that he typically subsists on cereal, Mrs. Mac\u2019s reheated leftovers, and assorted snack foods, it\u2019s not like he can\u2019t cook. It\u2019s more like why bother when he could just slap some peanut butter on a few graham crackers or scarf down a handful of salami straight out of the deli bag and call it a day?\n\u201cI know how to follow a recipe,\u201d he argues, because he does. Kind of. Sort of. If chemistry labs count. \u201cI\u2019m sure I can figure it out.\u201d\n\u201cMmhmm\u2026\u201d Jason nods slowly. The corners of his lips are twitching upwards like he\u2019s trying not to say something.\u00a0\nDaring him to continue, Tim attempts to imitate one of Alfred\u2019s signature Looks\u2122. It must not be very effective because Jason just laughs.\n\u201cOkay, Martha Stewart.\u201d He takes a bite of his granola bar, ignoring Tim\u2019s glare. \u201cWell, if you decide you don\u2019t wanna fly solo, we could always just do the cooking together at the Manor after school.\u201d Shrugging nonchalantly, he adds, \u201cWho knows\u2014could even be fun.\u201d\nWell, that certainly sounds tempting\u2014both for the company and the extra set of hands\u2014but Tim would hate to be in the way, especially the day before a major holiday. \u201cWouldn\u2019t Alfred mind if we\u2019re using the kitchen?\u201d he asks.\nJason scoffs. \u201cAlfie? Nah, he\u2019s not even home. He\u2019s in New York for the weekend.\u201d At Tim\u2019s baffled expression, he explains, \u201cHe always takes one holiday off a year to visit this old army buddy of his. He\u2019s a butler too, funnily enough\u2014works at an estate up in Loudonville. They\u2019re both super British, so god knows why they picked Thanksgiving this year, but Dick and I think it\u2019s so they can just get drunk and eat chips and not worry about cooking for once.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cB was just gonna order Chinese.\u201d\nTim sticks a straw in his milk carton, nodding slowly as he takes this information in. It\u2019s kind of hard to imagine a pair of prim and posh British butlers kicking it back with glasses of whisky, swapping war stories, and avoiding American holidays.\u00a0\n(Then he remembers the few glimpses he\u2019s gotten of Alfred\u2019s more relaxed side on D&amp;D nights and it all makes a little more sense.)\n\u201cAnyway, he left this morning, but Dick\u2019s in town for the weekend,\u201d Jason goes on. \u201cWe could probably rope him into helping too.\u201d\nTim raises a skeptical eyebrow. \u201cSo now we want Dick cooking?\u201d Does that mean the whole \u2018burning pop-tarts\u2019 bit from Tim\u2019s birthday was made up on the fly?\u00a0\n(Because if so, the Waynes should really consider careers in improv if the vigilante life doesn\u2019t work out.)\nJason doesn\u2019t miss a beat. \u201cWell I mean, he\u2019s no Alfred,\u201d he covers smoothly, \u201cbut he\u2019s no Bruce either, thank god.\u201d With a scoff, he says, \u201cB\u2019s been banned from the kitchen ever since the Chicken Parm-o-nella Incident of 2018.\u201d\nTim chokes on the milk he\u2019d just sipped.\nJason stares off into the distance, a haunted look to his eyes. \u201cDo you know how many bathrooms Wayne Manor has in total?\u201d\n\u201cUhh\u2013\u201d\n\u201cFourteen,\u201d he whispers hollowly. \u201cTrust me, Timmy. We found them all.\u201d\nTo Tim\u2019s relief, Jason turns out to be a pretty competent chef. His skills have been honed through many cozy afternoons spent cooking with Alfred, and he\u2019s nothing if not efficient. Within two hours of school letting out, he\u2019s raided both Drake and Wayne Manor for groceries, commandeered Alfred\u2019s kitchen, drawn up a detailed menu and plan of attack on a massive dry-erase board, and put both Dick and Tim to work.\nThe only thing he hasn\u2019t quite mastered is Alfred\u2019s calm demeanor.\n\u201cNo, the big pan!\u201d Jason groans across the kitchen. He\u2019s standing over the sink, slathering butter by the handful into the raw turkey\u2019s skin. \u201cThis bird is like, eighteen pounds. How the heck is he gonna fit in that?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019ll just tuck his legs in!\u201d Dick calls back over the deafening clang of metal pans as he rifles through the storage racks. \u201cWe need to save the big one for the green bean casserole!\u201d\nJason rolls his eyes. \u201cOkay, for the last time\u201d\u2014he jams an entire onion down the turkey\u2019s crevice, making Tim shudder\u2014\u201cwe are not serving the Drakes that mushy-ass casserole. That thing is an abomination and I don\u2019t know why Alfred still lets you make it.\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Dick balks, one hand clutched dramatically to his heart. \u201cThis is blatant disrespect of a time-honored holiday classic.\u201d\n\u201cThe fried onions literally come out of a can.\u201d\n\u201cWhich is part of the aesthetic!\u201d\nTim can\u2019t help but wince as he works his way through the little pile of carrots and celery Jason has assigned him to chop. As much as he usually enjoys listening to the two boys squabble, their volume level has him a little on edge today.\u00a0\nAccording to Dick, who\u2019d filled Tim and Jason in on the drive home from school, Bruce has been holed up in his study since late that morning on an emergency video conference call with Wayne Enterprises\u2019 board of directors. Some shady business practices from one of their more high-profile partners came to light last night, and the Board is in a time crunch trying to come to a decision on whether or not to cut their dealings with the firm before the holiday weekend. While Bruce readily agreed to Tim coming over that afternoon to cook, he\u2019s also politely requested that the boys try not to disturb him until the call is finished.\nJason and Dick both seem pretty chill about the situation and are more or less going about their day as usual, which Tim finds honestly baffling. If there\u2019s one thing he\u2019s learned over the years about adults who are in important, stressful, time-sensitive business situations, it\u2019s that it\u2019s best to make as little noise as possible and to stay far, far out of their way\u2014ideally not even be in the house at all, which Tim has suggested multiple times since Dick first filled them in.\u00a0\nJason, however, was insistent that they do the cooking here rather than at Tim\u2019s place, because, quote, \u2018Your folks don\u2019t seem the type to own a turkey baster, and no one likes a dry bird, Timmy.\u2019\nSo here they are.\n\u201cYou saved the giblets, right?\u201d Dick hollers. He\u2019s digging through the pantry for stale bread to use in the stuffing, tossing bags of chips and pretzels aside as he does so. \u201cBecause those make the best gravy.\u201d\nJason scoffs. \u201cOkay literally why do you have the taste of an 87-year-old pensioner?\u201d he demands. \u201cIs this some kind of circus hobo thing, or\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cHey, I have the taste of quality!\u201d Dick retorts, loud enough that it makes Tim cringe. Any minute now he\u2019s expecting Bruce to come storming out of his office to banish them all from the Manor, which is making it awfully hard to focus on the vegetables he\u2019s supposed to be prepping.\nThen, just as he thinks things can\u2019t possibly get any worse, Jason pulls an honest-to-god Cuisinart out of the cabinet and Tim watches his life flash before his eyes.\u00a0\n\u201cUh, maybe we should wait on that?\u201d he suggests nervously as Jason dumps a bag of frozen cranberries into the machine. They cascade down, rattling against the hard plastic of the food processor\u2019s bowl like marbles on stone. \u201cYou know, just until Bruce is off the phone?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nJason waves his hand dismissively. \u201cNah, it\u2019s fine,\u201d he says, twisting the lid in place. \u201cHis office is pretty much sound-proof.\u201d\nPretty much?! Pretty much?!  Is Jason seriously about to bet Tim\u2019s standing in Bruce Wayne\u2019s good graces on \u2018pretty much\u2019??\nEvidently so. He presses the \u2018on\u2019 button.\u00a0\n(Tim\u2019s convinced an air raid would be quieter.)\n\u201cJason!\u201d Dick barks over the cacophony of pulverizing berries, and Tim spins around just in time to see a mountain of white foam rising up over the edge of the bubbling pot on the stove. Dick quickly lowers the heat. \u201cYour potatoes are boiling over!\u201d\n\u201cSo check if they\u2019re done, dumbass!\u201d Jason shouts back, dumping a few handfuls of orange wedges into the food processor with the cranberries. \u201cI\u2019m busy!\u201d\nMuttering something under his breath, Dick pulls out a fork and stabs it into the pot. Then he frowns and stabs it again. And again. \u201cI can\u2019t tell!\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean you can\u2019t tell? Either the fork goes through or it doesn\u2019t!\u201d\n\u201cGuys\u2026\u201d Tim whines quietly, his chopping speed increasing right along with his heart rate. He shoots a worried glance over his shoulder toward the room\u2019s entrance. Maybe if he can catch sight of Bruce first, he can get the others to quiet down before he comes storming in and all hell breaks loose.\nDick stabs another chunk of potato. \u201cI mean, I can  make it  go through, but\u2013\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cDickie, I swear to god\u2013\u201d\u00a0\nTim is still craning his neck to see over his shoulder when the knife comes down.\u00a0\n\n Hard. \n\nIt takes a second for the pain to register, but he can feel the change in resistance instantly as the blade slices through a new target.\u00a0\nThat was definitely not a carrot.\nThe pain hits a split second later. Tim drops the knife down onto the cutting board with a clatter, pulling his hand up instinctively against his chest. Blood is already streaming from the deep slice he\u2019s just made at the base of his thumb.\nAcross the room, Dick\u2019s eyes go wide. \u201cJay,\u201d he orders, sharp and serious, with absolutely none of the playful tone he\u2019d had a few seconds ago.\nIt\u2019s his Nightwing voice.\nThe effect on Jason is instantaneous. He turns off the machine and whirls around. \u201cWhat\u2019s wro\u2013 Oh.\u201d He blinks at the blood flowing down Tim\u2019s arm in rivulets. \u201cShit.\u201d\n\u201cI-It\u2019s not that bad,\u201d Tim stammers, even while his thumb screams otherwise. Jason is already reaching into a drawer and grabbing one of the thick linen napkins from Alfred\u2019s stack. He chucks it across the room at his brother, who catches it without so much as a glance. \u201cJus- Just a cut.\u201d\nIn three long strides, Dick closes the distance between himself and Tim. \u201cCan I see it?\u201d he asks calmly.\nHesitantly, Tim extends his hand. Blood is dripping everywhere\u2014the cutting board, the counter, the floor. Dizzily, he thinks about how someone\u2019s gonna have to clean that up. But then Dick takes his hand and presses the folded cloth firmly against the wound and Tim is gasping, all of his thoughts suddenly replaced by blinding pain.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I know it hurts,\u201d Dick murmurs, not letting up at all as Tim clenches his teeth, eyes shut tightly against the pain. \u201cI just need to put pressure on it to stop the bleeding. Then I\u2019m going to let go again for just a second so we can see what we\u2019re dealing with, okay?\u201d\nTim nods tightly. \u201c\u2018Kay,\u201d he gasps out.\nJust as he said, Dick waits a few moments, then releases the pressure and draws the cloth back. Fresh blood rushes to the surface\u2014at kind of an alarming rate, Tim thinks with a little shudder\u2014but just before it can obscure the wound completely, he catches a glimpse of something silvery-white deep at the center of the cut and nearly gags on the spot.\nJason, who is peering over Tim\u2019s shoulder, seems to have seen it too. \u201cFuck,\u201d he whispers. \u201cIs that\u2026?\u201d\nDick doesn\u2019t answer\u2014just quickly reapplies pressure, causing Tim to hiss. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, you\u2019re alright,\u201d he soothes, squeezing Tim\u2019s thumb tightly as he guides him over to the breakfast nook. Tim feels weirdly detached, like he\u2019s floating more than walking the short distance to the table. \u201cHere, we\u2019re gonna just sit down and rest your elbow so we can keep your hand up above your heart, okay? Good, just like that,\u201d Dick praises, far more calmly than this much blood should warrant. He glances over at his brother. \u201cJay, can you\u2013?\u201d\n\u201cYep, I\u2019ll get Bruce,\u201d Jason agrees, already turning on his heel.\nThat\u2019s enough to snap Tim out of it. \u201cNo wait, don\u2019t!\u201d he gasps, sharply enough that it causes Jason to freeze mid-step. There was literally one rule for this afternoon, and Tim is not about to break it for some stupid accident. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to get him, it\u2019s not that bad!\u201d\nDick\u2019s eyes dart sideways over to Jason and the two boys exchange a bewildered expression.\u00a0\nGlancing back to Tim, Dick clears his throat. \u201cOkay, uh, Tim?\u201d he begins carefully, \u201cI don\u2019t want to alarm you or anything, but this cut is pretty deep.\u201d\nJason scoffs, \u201cYeah, like that\u2019s definitely gonna need stitches.\u201d\nWell no shit, but why do they need to bother Bruce for that? Tim once witnessed Nightwing give Batman an emergency blood transfusion in the parking lot of a ShopRite while they waited for Agent A to arrive\u2014literally hooked the man straight up to his own vein! Stitches? Stitches are  nothing. \n\u201cCan\u2019t you just do them?\u201d he pleads.\nThe room goes still.\n\u201c...Can\u2019t I do what?\u201d Dick asks carefully, while Jason just stares.\nOh shit. That\u2019s right. Nightwing did that. Dick Grayson, on the other hand, is a twenty-one-year-old college student with a part-time job teaching children\u2019s aerial arts and gymnastics classes in the next town over. There\u2019s literally no reason he should have intimate knowledge of emergency medical procedures.\n\u201cI-I mean, I know you can\u2019t do stitches,\u201d Tim quickly backtracks, both boys still eying him warily. \u201cBut we can wrap it up with gauze and stuff! Or\u2013 Or we could use superglue! Doctors use superglue sometimes and it works just like stitches, I\u2019ve seen it. You\u2019ve gotta have superglue somewhere, right?\u201d\nDick sighs. \u201cTim...\u201d\n\u201cOr you could just drive me to a walk-in clinic or whatever! There are ones downtown where you don\u2019t even have to have insurance or anything and they\u2019ll still take you, so it\u2019s fine, we can just do it ourselves,\u201d Tim babbles. He pulls in a shaky breath. \u201cJust\u2026 please. We can handle it, really. We don\u2019t need to bother Bruce, okay?\u201d\n\u201cBother him?\u201d Jason\u2019s looking at Tim like he\u2019s grown two heads. \u201cYou do realize you just cut yourself to the bone, right?\u201d\n\u201cJay,\u201d Dick warns under his breath.\n\u201cWhat? I\u2019m just trying to give him all the facts here!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well I\u2019m trying to keep him from going into shock,\u201d Dick mutters. He squeezes Tim\u2019s thumb a little tighter, and Tim can\u2019t bite back the whimper this time. \u201cJust go get B, okay?\u201d\n No no no, this can\u2019t be happening!  Wild-eyed, Tim grabs Jason\u2019s arm in a vice grip. \u201cPlease don\u2019t,\u201d he begs, trying and failing to keep the whine out of his voice. \u201cHe said not to bother him. He\u2019s on a really important call!\u201d\nJason huffs out an exasperated breath. \u201cYeah well he  meant  don\u2019t barge in and try to start a Nerf war with him, alright? Not that you\u2019re supposed to silently bleed out in his kitchen.\u201d\n\u201cBut he said\u2013\u201d\n\u201cLook, I\u2019d love to discuss this further, but maybe when you\u2019re not fucking dying, okay Tim?\u201d\nAnd with that, Jason shakes him off and sprints out of the room while Tim\u2019s eyes spill over with tears.\nTim doesn\u2019t bleed out, unfortunately.\nIt turns out Jason was just being dramatic and it\u2019s not even  possible  to bleed out from a finger injury (unless he was on blood thinners or had a bleeding disorder or something), because there just aren\u2019t any major enough arteries or veins located there. Dick spends the next minute or so calmly reassuring him of this fact\u2014no doubt misinterpreting Tim's hysterics for fear\u2014right up until a very concerned-looking Bruce comes jogging into the kitchen, an army-grade first aid kit tucked under his arm.\u00a0\nSix minutes, nine gauze pads, and almost an entire roll of surgical tape later, Tim is being ushered into Bruce\u2019s car for his second trip to Gotham General this year.\u00a0\n(At least he doesn\u2019t throw up on the way this time. Small mercies.)\nDick and Jason stay home. It\u2019s partly because there\u2019s a half-cooked turkey in the oven that they\u2019re not sure what else to do with, and partly because Tim straight-up asks them to. He isn\u2019t sure why Bruce hasn\u2019t gone off on him yet for interrupting his call, but he knows it\u2019s coming. At least this way he might be able to keep the others out of the line of fire.\nExcept that Bruce doesn\u2019t go off on him.\u00a0\nNot on the drive to the hospital, not while they check-in at the front desk, not during triage, and not at any point during the entire first hour they spend sitting in the waiting room (which is significantly more crowded this time, probably due to the holiday). In fact, other than a few concerned questions about Tim\u2019s pain level and whether or not the bandages are holding up, Bruce seems content to just sit there quietly, giving Tim the occasional tight-lipped smile or reassuring shoulder squeeze as they wait.\nTim finds it honestly unnerving. Why won\u2019t he just get it over with already? His parents never make him wait this long for a lecture.\nAt about the ninety minute mark, a nurse calls a young mother and her sobbing toddler back into an exam room, and Bruce leans over to whisper in Tim\u2019s ear.\u00a0\n\u201cI think we might have done  too good  a job of stopping the bleeding,\u201d he says with a hint of amusement. \u201cIt seems to have bumped you down the priority list. Looks like we\u2019ll be here for a while.\u201d\nThe knot of guilt twisting in Tim\u2019s stomach tightens. It\u2019s already after four o\u2019clock; at this rate, there\u2019s no way they\u2019re going to make it back home before the end of the business day.\u00a0\nSighing, Tim lowers his gaze to his lap. \u201cI can write the Board letters if you want,\u201d he offers quietly.\nBruce quirks an eyebrow. \u201cLetters?\u201d\n\u201cApology letters,\u201d Tim clarifies. \u201cFor interrupting your meeting.\u201d\n\u201cFor interrupting my...?\u201d Sudden understanding dawns on Bruce\u2019s features and then he looks almost physically pained. \u201cOh bud,  no. Is that why you\u2019re being so quiet? Do you think I\u2019m mad at you?\u201d\n\n Well, duh.\u00a0 \n\nTim says nothing.\nBruce sighs deeply. \u201cTim, I\u2019m not mad at you for getting hurt,\u201d he says. \u201cNot at all. Accidents happen, okay? I\u2019m just very glad I was working from home today so that I was available to help.\u201d\n (Available? Since when has \u2018working from home\u2019 ever meant someone was available?)\n\u201cBut\u2026 you were on a call,\u201d Tim points out, utterly confused. How is Tim the only one who keeps remembering that fact? \u201cIt was really important and people were counting on you to make decisions because you\u2019re their boss and stuff. But I made a whole scene and ruined everything and now\u2026\u201d He trails off, his throat growing tighter with every word.\u00a0\n\u201cNow what, bud?\u201d Bruce prompts gently.\nTim finishes in a whisper, \u201cNow you\u2019re stuck here with me.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d The pained look on Bruce\u2019s face intensifies, concern and kindness is etched into every winkle of his brow. \u201cI\u2019m not stuck anywhere. I\u2019m exactly where I need to be\u2014making sure you\u2019re okay.\u201d He gives Tim\u2019s knee a squeeze. \u201cThat\u2019s the most important thing I could be doing right now.\u201d\nThe words are spoken so sincerely that it makes Tim\u2019s chest ache and his eyes start to sting. Still, he knows better than to believe them.\u00a0\n\u201cBut it\u2019s unprofessional,\u201d he murmurs, gazing morosely down at the thick pad of bandages wrapped around his thumb. \u201cTo let some stupid kid get in the way of an entire company.\u201d\nA flash of something sharp crosses Bruce\u2019s face and Tim winces, instantly regretting his words.  Great job, Tim. You basically just accused the CEO of one of the richest companies in Gotham of being an incompetent\u00a0business leader. \nBut instead of snapping at him, Bruce just closes his eyes and takes a deep breath, like he\u2019s counting to ten or something, and his face relaxes back to neutral. \u201cIs that something your parents told you?\u201d he asks quietly.\nTim just shrugs.\n\u201cHm,\u201d Bruce says. He\u2019s silent for a long moment, then, \u201cWell that\u2019s bullshit, Tim.\u201d\nTim looks up, startled.\n\u201cThe ability to prioritize what\u2019s truly important in any given situation is one of the most professional qualities there is,\u201d Bruce says firmly. \u201cAnd family emergencies will always come first.\u201d\nWhether it\u2019s the stress or the pain, Tim doesn\u2019t know, but his internal filter just keeps failing him today. \u201cYeah, well\u2026\u201d He finds himself huffing out a bitter little laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s not really been my experience.\u201d\nTim shouldn\u2019t have said it, but of course now that he has, Bruce can\u2019t just let it go. He raises an eyebrow, deceptively casual. \u201cWhat has been your experience, Tim?\u201d\n (\"I don\u2019t care what you do, Timothy, just do it quietly,\" his mother\u2019s annoyed voice echoes somewhere in the back of his mind.)\nTim tugs idly at one of the stray threads of the gauze. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m just not supposed to bother them, you know?\u201d\nBruce hums thoughtfully. A nurse with a tablet comes out and calls back another patient\u2014an older man who\u2019s been sitting hunched over and clutching an emesis basin to his chest since well before they arrived. His wife helps him up and they both shuffle on back.\nOnce it\u2019s quiet again, Bruce asks calmly, \u201cDo they get angry when you bother them?\u201d\nTim frowns; they\u2019re approaching dangerous territory now and the last thing he needs is Bruce getting the wrong idea. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say  angry, exactly. More like, irritated I guess.\u201d\n Irritated. That\u2019s a good word for it. It\u2019s not like his parents ever hit him or anything\u2014hell, they barely even yell at him. Most of the time they just get annoyed and huffy and send him outside or off to his room for a while. The worst he gets is the occasional cutting remark or two, but what parent doesn\u2019t lose their temper on occasion? They\u2019re certainly not abusive\u2014that\u2019s absurd.\nAnd anyway, he almost prefers it when they do yell. At least it means they\u2019re still talking to him.\n\u201cWhat kinds of things do they do when they\u2019re irritated?\u201d Bruce asks, and okay, Tim is getting to the end of his patience now.\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, normal things,\u201d he huffs. Sick of playing twenty questions, he decides to just cut to the chase. \u201cLook, they don\u2019t hurt me or anything if that\u2019s what you\u2019re getting at, okay?\u201d\nHe\u2019s never even been spanked before\u2014at least not by his parents. There was this one nanny Tim vaguely remembers from when he was little who used to swat him on the behind for misbehaving, but when his parents found out about it, they\u2019d fired her right on the spot.\u00a0\n\"What makes you think you have the right to lay a hand on my son in my own home?\" Jack had snarled at her. She\u2019d opened her mouth to explain, but he\u2019d been too angry to let her speak. He\u2019d just pointed at the door. \"Consider yourself dismissed. We\u2019ll send your last check in the mail!\"\nTo this day, it\u2019s probably the angriest Tim\u2019s ever seen his father, and though he remembers being scared and upset at the time, now when Tim looks back on that particular memory, all he feels is warm.\nTwo days later, Ms. Sophie was hired. It\u2019s the last time he can recall his parents truly fighting for him.\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Bruce says gently, \u201cthere are an awful lot of ways to hurt someone.\u201d\nTim forces a shrug. \u201cYeah I know,\u201d he says. \u201cBut they don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n They\u2019d have to be around for that. \n\nBruce purses his lips. He looks like he\u2019s choosing his next words very carefully. \u201cSometimes\u2026 it\u2019s less about what a person does, and more about what they don't do.\u201d\nA lump settles in Tim\u2019s throat and  nope, nuh-uh, no siree Bob, not happening,  he is not going to be thinking about this right now. Not sitting in some crowded waiting room with eight layers of gauze wrapped around his thumb on Thanksgiving Eve next to Bruce Fucking Wayne. \u00a0\nNot when his parents are finally coming  home  for once.\n\u201cLook, can\u2013\u201d Balling his non-injured fist up, Tim presses it against his eye socket. \u201cCan we just talk about something else? Please?\u201d\nConcern flickers across Bruce\u2019s face, but then he just smiles that sad smile of his. \u201cOf course, bud,\u201d he says softly, shifting back around in his seat again as he gives Tim\u2019s arm another squeeze. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me about some of the apps you\u2019ve been working on lately?\u201d\nAnd for the next several hours, they do just that.\nIt\u2019s nearly eight p.m. by the time Tim\u2019s thumb is stitched back into place and he and Bruce make it back to the Manor, and by that time the kitchen resembles a war zone.\u00a0\nPunk-pop music is blasting from the speakers; nearly every horizontal surface is piled with dirty pots, pans, bowls, cutting boards, and cooking utensils; the cabinet doors are all hanging open; the floor is coated in a mixture of flour, spilled gravy, and breadcrumbs; and some kind of orange goop that Tim can only pray is pie filling is steadily dripping down from the ceiling onto the stovetop.\u00a0\nIn the middle of it all, Dick and Jason are standing over the kitchen island, scooping mashed potatoes into a rectangular pyrex container.\n\u201cOh no, you didn\u2019t have to finish cooking for me!\u201d Tim gasps in horror as he takes in the sight. About a dozen similar containers are stacked on the countertop, each one filled with the various fruits of their labor, and it makes him feel suddenly woozy. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant when I said you should stay home!\u201d\nDick chuckles. \u201cRelax, Timmy. We know that\u2019s not what you meant. We just wanted to help out and everything was already started anyway.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, besides you guys were gone for like,  five hours,\u201d Jason retorts, topping the mashed potato container off with a lid and adding it to the growing tower. \u201cWhat else were we gonna do?\u201d\n\u201c...Clean up, perhaps,\u201d Bruce mutters under his breath.\n\u201cHey, we cleaned the biohazards!\u201d Dick says, much too cheerfully. Jerking his head sideways, he indicates the only two clear areas in the room\u2014the breakfast nook table, and Tim\u2019s former chopping station. The white plastic cutting board is slightly discolored now and there\u2019s a strong scent of bleach in the air.\n\u201cHn.\u201d Bruce nods, his lips twitching upwards like he\u2019s trying not to smile and only mostly succeeding. He looks almost proud. \u201cThat you did.\u201d\nFresh guilt twists in Tim\u2019s stomach. He starts rolling up his sleeves. \u201cI can clean the rest up myself,\u201d he offers quickly. \u201cYou guys just go sit down, I got it.\u201d\nJason snorts, sliding the now-empty potato pot over to the growing mountain of dirty dishes. \u201cTim, you lost like a pint of blood this afternoon and you\u2019re basically wearing an oven mitt made of gauze. If anyone should be sitting down right now, it\u2019s you.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, plus Alfred\u2019s rule is whoever doesn\u2019t cook has to help with the clean up,\u201d Dick throws in. Abandoning his station, he moves over to place a hand on Tim\u2019s shoulder to steer him towards the family room. \u201cSo since the three of us all cooked...\u201d\u00a0\nGrinning, Jason dumps the remaining empty pyrex containers into Bruce\u2019s arms, giving him two quick pats on the back as he heads out. \u201cHave fun, old man!\u201d\nTim ends up spending the night at the Manor.\nHe feels awfully guilty about it, especially considering it\u2019s a well-known fact that Gotham\u2019s crime rate usually surges in the days surrounding any major holiday, but the Waynes are insistent that he not stay home alone while freshly injured. Tim tries to argue that it wasn\u2019t even that big of a deal and he\u2019s perfectly fine now, but Jason isn\u2019t having it.\n(\u201cYou were just at the ER, Timmy. What do you think the E stands for? Elephants? Eggo waffles? Edward Scissorhands?\u201d / \u201cJay, that\u2019s enough\u201d / \u201cWhat? I\u2019m not wrong!\u201d)\nResigning himself to stay, Tim tries to make up for it by declining the Waynes\u2019 offer of a movie after dinner by claiming he has a bad headache and going straight up to bed. His hope is that Batman &amp; Co. will use the opportunity afforded to slip out and patrol once they think he\u2019s asleep.\u00a0\nUnfortunately, Tim\u2019s plan backfires as it just seems to make Bruce worried about him. Not only does he not go out that night, but he frowns a lot and makes Tim rate his pain on a scale and drink a bunch of fluids and take an ice pack up to bed with him. Later, while Tim is pretending to be asleep, he even pokes his head in the doorway to check on him.\u00a0\n\n Twice. \n\n(What is Tim, an infant??)\nGranted\u2026 it  is kind of nice to have someone actually seem to care about him. Especially since the headache isn\u2019t a total lie\u2014crying always has that effect on Tim. It\u2019s one of the many reasons he tries to do it as rarely as possible.\nOr, at least he used to rarely cry. This past half a year or so has been\u2026 unprecedented, to say the least. Kind of ever since he met the Waynes, actually\u2026\nHuh.\n(He tries not to think too hard about that one.)\nThe next morning, Bruce checks Tim\u2019s stitches and changes his dressing while the boys eat cereal and watch the Macy\u2019s parade on Alfred\u2019s little kitchen TV set. The Waynes spend the entire time debating whether the parade is a fun and harmless holiday tradition, or just a weird American flex of corporate greed and consumerism. Bruce argues the former, Jason the latter, and Dick keeps flip-flopping between sides like the freaking acrobat he is.\nIt\u2019s actually kind of weird how much the Waynes seem to enjoy arguing with each other about random crap. Even weirder how they seem to genuinely consider each other\u2019s points and occasionally even change their positions.\u00a0\n(Couldn\u2019t be the Drakes, that\u2019s for sure.)\nAnyway, according to the airline app that Tim keeps checking, his parents\u2019 flight gets in a little before three that afternoon, meaning Jack and Janet should make it home sometime between four-thirty and five. At Tim\u2019s request, Bruce drops him off at home around noon so that he has plenty of time to get ready for them.\n\u2026And also to ensure that the Waynes\u00a0have plenty of opportunity to assume their alter egos. Tim doesn\u2019t think he could bear the guilt if he prevented them from going out for two consecutive patrols.\n\u201cYou can call us if you need anything, okay?\u201d Bruce says as the car rolls to a stop at the end of the Drakes\u2019 driveway. He shifts the gear to park. \u201cEspecially if you run into any trouble with those stitches. We\u2019d be more than happy to help.\u201d\n\u201cYeah I know,\u201d Tim assures, as if he hasn\u2019t just decided that he\u2019d rather see his entire thumb fall off than inconvenience the Waynes one more time this weekend. He opens the car door and hops out, gathering the straps of the tote bag full of Thanksgiving leftovers Dick and Jason packed him in his good hand.\n\u201cI sent your parents an email last night regarding the follow up appointment to get your stitches removed,\u201d Bruce continues. \u201cSo far they haven\u2019t replied, but\u2013\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll make sure they see it when they get home, thank you so much.\u201d\n Oh my god, just leave already, I'm\u00a0fine.\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Bruce says with a sigh. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll let you head inside then.\u201d Tim starts to close the door, but Bruce stops it with his hand, looking him right in the eyes. \u201cJust\u2026 text us when your parents get in, alright? So we don\u2019t worry?\u201d\nOkay what is with all this coddling? Tim\u2019s really going to have to figure out how to fix this whole \u2018damsel in distress\u2019 thing he\u2019s had going on for the past couple months\u2014it\u2019s really hurting his image.\u00a0\n(Besides, he knows for a fact that Bruce has already downloaded the very same flight app Tim\u2019s been checking all day; he saw it on his home screen earlier.)\nWhatever. Experience has taught Tim that agreement is the fastest way to get adults off his case.\u00a0\n\u201cSure,\u201d he says, Gala Smile\u2122 and all. \u201cI\u2019ll be sure to let you know.\u201d\nHe shuts the door before he can see Bruce\u2019s face change.\nAt half-past four, Tim fires up the oven to start reheating the food.\u00a0\nSoon Drake Manor is filled with the aroma of roast turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, gravy, and about five other sides\u2014including something mushy and grayish-green in color that process of elimination dictates must be Dick\u2019s casserole.\nTim snorts out a laugh. He might just keep that one in the fridge for later.\nFive o\u2019clock comes and goes with no sign of Tim\u2019s parents, but that\u2019s not too unusual. The traffic must be bad, that\u2019s all.\u00a0\nHe lowers the oven by a few degrees and shoots them both a quick text saying he\u2019s looking forward to seeing them soon.\nAt six he sends a follow-up text, just checking in. The airline app says they landed on time, but maybe they stopped somewhere on the way home. No biggie, they can\u2019t be much longer.\nHe passes the time while he waits for a reply by making little aluminum foil hats for the dishes to keep them warm.\nWhen there\u2019s still no reply by seven, Tim tries calling his mother\u2019s phone. It goes straight to voicemail, so he repeats the process with his dad and gets the same result.\nHm. Maybe he should reheat the food again\u2026\nAt seven-thirty, Tim smacks a palm to his forehead.  Of course!  God, he\u2019s so stupid. They just must have forgotten to change their SIM cards back to the US ones.\nShaking his head in relief, Tim shoots off another text, this time to their international numbers.\nIt fails to deliver.\n(He's starting to get a stomach ache.)\nBy nine p.m, Tim has transformed the kitchen into his war room.\nAfter hacking into the airport\u2019s security system to ensure that yes, his parents really did land in New Jersey and made it successfully through customs, he started taking matters into his own hands. He\u2019s already printed up several maps plotting out his parents\u2019 most likely routes home from the airport, is currently in the process of calling each of the hospitals in the area to confirm whether or not anyone matching either of their descriptions has been admitted, and is using his police scanner to listen anxiously for any news of vehicular incidents on the freeways.\nHe\u2019s so lost in his work that he jumps when his phone buzzes with a message from Bruce:\n\n Everything okay with your folks? We haven\u2019t gotten a text from you yet. \n\nDespite the holiday, Tim knows for a fact that the Bats are out patrolling tonight. He heard a couple of the officers on the police scanner mention a  2-1-20  at a crime scene downtown\u2014the GCPD\u2019s code for vigilante-related assistance.\u00a0\nHe takes a deep breath. It\u2019s fine. Gotham needs Bruce more than he does.\u00a0\nOpening up the flight app, Tim takes a quick screenshot of the screen confirming their arrival time of 2:55 p.m. He forwards the photo to Bruce along with a series of Thanksgiving-food emojis, a smiley face, and a thumbs up.\n Glad to hear it,  Bruce shoots back a few seconds later.  Hope you\u2019re all having a wonderful evening. \n You too!! Tim replies, and slides his phone back into his pocket.\nThen he lurches for the kitchen sink and vomits down the drain.\nAt 10:39 p.m. Tim is sitting at the dining room table in a daze, half-heartedly nibbling on a bread roll to settle his stomach. He\u2019s been listening to the scanner for hours now, having already called every hospital within a fifty-mile radius, all with no word of his parents.\nWhen his phone finally lights up with the familiar name, he fumbles it right off the table in his mad rush to accept the call.\u00a0\n\u201cDad? Are you guys alright?\u201d Tim blurts the second has the phone to his ear.\n\u201cWell hello to you too, son,\u201d Jack chuckles in that very specific wry voice of his that\u2019s typically reserved for company. Unlike Tim, he doesn\u2019t sound the least bit distressed. \u201cYour mother and I were just discussing your schooling\u2014remind me again, are you taking AP Economics this semester, or next?\u201d\n\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Tim blinks a few times, his brain short-circuiting at the bewildering question. \u201cI think\u2026 I\u2019m taking it junior year?\u201d\n\u201cYes yes, junior year, of course.\u201d He can practically see his dad\u2019s dismissive hand wave through the phone. \u201cBut is it the fall semester, or the spring? See, we\u2019re trying to determine if Charles Albrecht is in your class or not. You remember little Charlie, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYeah\u2026 I remember him,\u201d Tim says slowly as he tries to wrap his head around how exactly the sixteen-year-old son of the CEO of one of the largest tech conglomerates in New Jersey factors into this. \u201cBut I\u2019m only a sophomore this year, so\u2026 neither.\u201d\n\u201cYou are?\u201d Jack sounds surprised. And maybe a bit disappointed. \u201cHm. Well, how are your grades looking? Perhaps we can talk your counselor into letting you take it a little early\u2026\u201d\n(Okay literally  what is happening right now???) \n\u201cAnyhow,\u201d Jack barrels right along, \u201cwe\u2019ve been chatting with Theodore and Marleen, and they mentioned plans to host a study group for Charles and a select group of his Econ classmates next term. Your mother and I think it could be a fantastic networking opportunity for you, which is why we immediately suggested that\u2013\u201d\n\u201cWait sorry, go back just a sec,\u201d Tim interrupts, too baffled by this entire call to let his dad ramble on any further. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 at the Albrechts right now?\u201d\n\u201cWell of course we are!\u201d Jack chuckles. \u201cBut you knew that\u2014it was all in your mother\u2019s email. That\u2019s why we booked the early flight we did, so we could make it back in time to attend their Thanksgiving banquet.\u201d\nTim\u2019s glad he\u2019s sitting down because he\u2019s feeling kind of woozy all of a sudden. Switching his phone over to speaker mode, he pulls up the email and skims through it quickly just to make sure he hasn\u2019t become suddenly illiterate.\n\u201cIt just says you\u2019re flying back to Gotham on Thursday,\u201d Tim reads off. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t say anything about going to a banquet.\u201d\n\u201cNo? I could\u2019ve sworn we put it in\u2026\u201d Jack murmurs, more to himself than Tim. He chuckles again. \u201cAh well, things are winding down now anyway. We\u2019ll be home in an hour or two.\u201d He hums thoughtfully, as though just recalling something. \u201cAlthough, Erik Langley has been tossing the idea of nightcaps around\u2026\u201d\nStaring at the sea of now-cold foil-wrapped dishes in front of him, Tim decides he\u2019s had just about enough of this stupid holiday.\nIn hindsight, it\u2019s kind of impressive that Tim made it as long as he did.\u00a0\nGetting mugged at knifepoint is practically a rite of passage for Gothamites, and considering the fact that he\u2019s been stalking literal vigilantes down some of the most crime-ridden parts of the city several times a week since he turned  nine,  it was really only a matter of time before some low-life cornered Tim on his way back to the bus stop, a steel blade pressed up against his windpipe.\nThe irony of the situation is that Tim was willing to give it all up without a fuss\u2014cash, bus pass, debit card, phone\u2026 even his camera. The only thing that he attempted to keep was the SD card.\u00a0\nBut of course, the mugger noticed him discreetly ejecting it. His lips curled up into a sneer.\n\n (\u201cWhatcha got on there, kid? Somethin\u2019 dirty?\u201d) \n\nWell, Tim certainly wasn\u2019t about to hand over 500+ candid shots of Batman, Robin, and Nightwing kicking ass to the same scumbag who just took his phone (and the three albums worth of photos he\u2019d taken with the Waynes contained within).\nSo instead, Tim asked himself a quick WWJTD:  What Would Jason Todd Do?\u00a0 \nThen Tim kneed that sucker right in the groin.\u00a0\n\n (\u201cGaaahhh fucking dammit you little piece of shit!\u201d) \n\nAnd, to Tim\u2019s surprise, it actually worked. He was able to take advantage of the mugger\u2019s momentary distraction to wrench his camera and phone back, break the mugger\u2019s hold, and book it back down the alley, not slowing once all the way back to the bus stop.\nAs a bonus, he also won a free knife!\n\u2026Which is currently firmly wedged in his back, just above his right shoulder blade.\n(He\u2019s starting to understand all that body armor his heroes wear now...)\nTim makes it home.\nThe details of  how  exactly this happens are a little fuzzy. One moment he\u2019s sitting on a bus stop bench in a daze, the handle of a switchblade sticking out of his back, and the next he\u2019s standing on the grounds of Drake Manor, gazing up the trellis at his bedroom window with absolutely no memory how he got from point A to point B.\n(He\u2019s always heard that shock can be one hell of a drug, but\u2026  wow.  They ain\u2019t lying.)\nDespite how oddly  little  his shoulder hurts at the moment (and from what Tim knows of shock, he\u2019s pretty sure that isn\u2019t a good sign), he figures scaling two stories with a knife in his back isn\u2019t the best plan, so he wanders around to the back door instead. With his parents actually in town for once, he normally wouldn\u2019t risk coming in this way, but they\u2019d left around nine that evening to get drinks with some of their\u2026 shall we say,  less-reputable  business contacts over in Somerset, and Tim knows how these things go. He\u2019d be shocked to see them back before three a.m.\u00a0\n Gauze,  he thinks idly as he moves through the first floor of the mansion towards the stairs. He\u2019s gonna need a lot of gauze.\nActually, that\u2019s a good question; do the Drakes even own gauze? If so, Tim\u2019s not sure where. He\u2019s got a box of assorted Pok\u00e9mon-themed band-aids in his bathroom cabinet upstairs, but something tells him that\u2019s not going to cut it this time.\u00a0\nA vague memory surfaces in the back of Tim\u2019s mind\u2014a small red pouch with a white cross on top that Ms. Sophie used to pull out whenever he scraped his knees playing outside. Were those her supplies, he wonders as he mounts the grand staircase, or do they still have that somewhere? In a closet, maybe? Or the master bathroom?\n\u201c...Timothy?\u201d\u00a0\nHe freezes mid-step, just one stair below the top landing. His mother is standing in the doorway of her bedroom in a dressing gown, her arms crossed over her chest.\u00a0\n(Fuck, that\u2019s right. He\u2019d lost some time earlier, hadn\u2019t he? Probably should\u2019ve factored that in\u2026)\n\u201cWere you outside just now?\u201d she asks, sounding more puzzled than angry.\u00a0\n\u201cUhh\u2026\u201d Tim\u2019s suddenly very, very glad he\u2019s wearing all black at the moment. The knife\u2019s handle is still sticking out of the back of his coat. He can feel the blood soaking through the shirt underneath.\n\u201cWe thought you\u2019d gone to bed,\u201d she says. Now that Tim\u2019s focusing a little more, he can hear Jack\u2019s quiet snores issuing from the bedroom. \u201cYour father and I got home not too long ago\u2026\u201d\u00a0\nSomething about her is off. Her voice has a floaty, almost dreamlike quality to it, and there\u2019s a faraway look in her eyes, as if she\u2019s gazing beyond Tim instead of at him.\u00a0\n Ambien,  he realizes belatedly. His mother always has a hard time winding down after negotiations like these, so she usually takes Ambien to help her sleep. It\u2019s especially effective when there\u2019s been a few glasses of wine involved.\nJanet is high as a kite right now.\nHer brow furrows slightly as her gaze falls to the camera strapped around Tim\u2019s neck. \u201cWere you taking pictures?\u201d\n\u201cY-Yeah,\u201d Tim stammers, stepping up onto the landing. \u201cI couldn't sleep so I was just taking some pictures in the backyard. Of the sky and stuff.\u201d He gives a nervous little chuckle. \u201cThat night vision lens you got me, you know...\u201d\nJanet is still looking at him with that mildly curious expression, and Tim\u2019s heart rate starts to pick up.\n Please, please don\u2019t ask to see them,  he silently begs the universe.  You\u2019ve never cared before. Don\u2019t start now! \nIt seems luck is on his side for once. \u201cHm,\u201d she says, her face relaxing into a faint smile. \u201cThat sounds nice.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, it was,\u201d Tim agrees, careful to keep his back to his mother as he shuffles sideways down the hall. Ironically, the shock of bumping into her seems to have overridden the  other shock  he\u2019s been experiencing. He\u2019s really feeling that knife now. \u201cAnyway, it worked\u2014I\u2019m pretty tired, so I think I\u2019ll just, uh, head back to bed\u2026\u201d\nJanet hums lightly as Tim reaches his bedroom door. He extends his hand to turn the knob, then freezes when he realizes it\u2019s completely covered in blood.\n(Oh well. He\u2019s had a good run, anyway.)\nWincing, Tim holds his breath, waiting for the other shoe to drop.\nIt doesn\u2019t.\n\u201cGoodnight, dear\u2026\u201d Janet murmurs dreamily. And with that, she slips back into her bedroom, the door behind her closing with a soft \u2018click.\u2019\nOkay, so, Google is worthless.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s what Tim decides after stumbling into the bathroom with his laptop and spending a couple minutes frantically scouring the internet on an incognito tab with the keywords: \u2018stabbed shoulder what to do knife still in\u2019\n Call 911, the articles say.\n Seek professional help, they all advise.\n DO NOT attempt to remove the foreign object under ANY circumstance,  they warn aggressively in all caps.\nCompletely. Utterly. Worthless.\nHis trusted friend YouTube has a decent-looking tutorial at least, but it\u2019s thirteen minutes long and Tim\u2019s ears are ringing too loudly to hear much of what the guy is saying. He fast-forwards through the beginning until he hits an unskippable ad for skin care products, then slams the laptop lid shut in a fit of frustration.\u00a0\nGuess he\u2019s doing this the old fashioned way.\u00a0\nTaking a deep breath, Tim reaches up and grasps the knife firmly by the handle, then yanks it straight out.\nTim\u2019s vision goes  white. \nHoly.\nFucking.\nShitballs.\n(He\u2019s kind of starting to miss being in shock.)\nOnce he\u2019s finally managed to stop gasping in sharp lungfuls of air and blink back the tears from his eyes, Tim resumes the task at hand. Removing his coat is easy enough, but taking off the shirt underneath is a whole ordeal. Blood has already started to dry around the edges of the wound, adhering the fabric to his skin. He has to peel it off, barely managing to stifle his cries of pain as blood streams down his back, pooling in the waistband of his jeans and dripping down the inside of his pant legs.\u00a0\nAt least it\u2019s only \u2018streaming\u2019 and not \u2018gushing\u2019 or \u2018spurting,\u2019 he thinks dizzily. That probably means he\u2019s not dying, right?\n\n Right? \n\n(Admittedly, Tim\u2019s not much of an expert. This is, after all, his first time getting stabbed.)\nBy the time he\u2019s worked himself free of his clothes, his head is swimming and everything is starting to look a little dark around the edges. He lowers himself down shakily to sit on the floor. He knows he needs to find something to put pressure on the wound, but there\u2019s nothing around to\u2013\nNever mind. That\u2019ll do.\nTim tugs his still-damp bath towel down from the rack and wads it up into a ball. After setting it on the ground, he lies down with his shoulder directly on top. The pressure sends a fresh jolt of pain through his back, and he has to clench his teeth hard to keep quiet, but it fades fairly quickly back into that sort of buzzing numbness.\nHe wishes the floor wasn\u2019t so cold against his bare back because it\u2019s making him shiver. Or maybe that\u2019s just the shock again\u2014what does Tim know? It\u2019s fine though, he won\u2019t stay down here long. Just until he stops feeling so dizzy and can figure out what to do about this.\u00a0\nThe bright lights above the mirror are making Tim\u2019s eyes hurt, so he lets them drift shut, just for a moment.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s all he needs. Just a moment.\u00a0\nThen he\u2019ll handle this.\nThe next thing Tim knows, sunlight is streaming in through the little half-window over the toilet, the battery-powered alarm clock on the sink counter reading 11:02 a.m.\nHe blinks. Then blinks again. Then one more time, just for good measure.\nDid\u2026 Did that seriously just happen? Did Tim actually pass out on the bathroom floor for eight hours straight, half-naked, shivering, and covered in his own blood?\nAll evidence, particularly the formerly yellow towel that\u2019s now adhered to his shoulder in tacky dried blood, is pointing to \u2018yes.\u2019\n(Well shit. Who needs sleeping pills when you can just get stabbed?) \nThe good news is, at eleven a.m, the house is well and truly empty. Both Jack and Janet are attending a meeting at the Gotham office of Drake Industries today, so Tim has no trouble getting to the master bathroom undetected. It takes a bit of searching through the cabinets, but he eventually locates a bottle of rubbing alcohol and an unopened box containing twelve individually-wrapped gauze pads. They\u2019re smaller than he\u2019d hoped for, but hey, better than nothing.\nHeading back to his own bathroom, he deposits his bounty on the counter, then steps into the shower to try and see if he can lose this whole \u2018actor in a student-produced slasher film\u2019 vibe he\u2019s got going on. His shoulder is bleeding freely again by the time he\u2019s done, but not nearly as much as last night, so he\u2019s not too worried.\n(God does it hurt, though.)\nAfter wrapping his lower half in a towel, Tim pops a couple ibuprofen for the pain and uncaps the rubbing alcohol. Then he takes a deep breath, lifts the bottle up behind his head, and pours.\nIn the spirit of the holiday season, Tim takes the next few moments to count his blessings:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01) He\u2019s thankful that no one is home to hear him scream.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02) He\u2019s thankful he doesn\u2019t pass out again\u2014and, honestly, it\u2019s a near thing. His vision keeps fading in and out and his ears are roaring.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03) He\u2019s thankful that he didn\u2019t eat much last night, because the blinding pain brings about a wave of nausea and he\u2019s very nearly reacquainted with Mrs. Mac\u2019s shepherd\u2019s pie. He already suffered through it the first time; he\u2019d hate to have to do it again.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04) He\u2019s thankful there isn\u2019t much alcohol left in the bottle because it means he gets to stop soon without feeling like a wuss.\nHe couldn\u2019t find anything resembling medical tape in his parents\u2019 cabinets, but Tim\u2019s pretty good at improvising. He slaps two gauze pads onto the bleeding wound, reinforcing them with a thick wad of folded paper towels, then duct tapes the whole thing firmly in place like the little MacGyver he is.\nThere. Got that sorted.\nFor the next two days, Tim wears his darkest clothing (having learned a thing or two from Dick\u2019s mistakes) and does his best to stay out of his parents\u2019 way. Even with Tim currently off school for winter break, it\u2019s not a very difficult task. His parents both keep pretty packed schedules, and it\u2019s not like they ever willingly seek him out. Still, there are a few close calls.\nFor example, when Tim walks past the laundry room Thursday afternoon to find his mother holding up his blood-stained towel (which he\u2019d definitely meant to put in the trash can and not his hamper, whoops).\n\u201cWhat happened here?\u201d She\u2019s pinching the corner of the towel with her fingertips, nose wrinkled in both curiosity and disgust.\n\u201cOh, I just uh\u2026\u201d Tim shifts his weight, subconsciously angling his back away from her as if she\u2019s capable of seeing through his thick sweatshirt to the wound below. \u201cNosebleed.\u201d\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a pretty weak lie. First of all, there\u2019s  way  too much blood for that, and second, Tim has never had a nosebleed in his life.\nThankfully, it seems as though his mother hasn\u2019t been paying too much attention to Tim\u2019s medical history over the years because she just sighs. \u201cWell, next time, kindly use something  disposable  to mop it up rather than 600 thread count premium Turkish cotton.\u201d\nTim does his best to look sheepish. \u201cSorry,\u201d he mutters at his feet.\n\u201cHere, take this,\u201d Janet says, tossing the soiled towel over to him. A jolt of pain shoots through Tim\u2019s shoulder as he instinctively moves his right hand to grab it, and he grimaces as he feels the wound tear itself open again.\u00a0\n(There goes that dressing.)\n\u201cThrow it out in the outside trash can,\u201d his mother says briskly. \u201cI don\u2019t want it stinking up the house, alright?\u201d\n\u201cGot it,\u201d Tim agrees, then hurries away to do her bidding before the bandages soak through again.\nThere\u2019s another close call the following day.\u00a0Tim is kneeling once more on the floor of his parents\u2019 bathroom, digging under the sink for anything remotely resembling bandage materials. At the rate he keeps reopening this wound, he\u2019s already burned through ten of his twelve gauze pads and he\u2019s really stretching those last two.\n This is probably why vigilantes learn how to do stitches,  he thinks bitterly, shoving aside his mother\u2019s bath bomb collection and a few cans of shaving cream as he searches. Granted, even if he knew  how  to stitch himself up, the position of this particular wound would prevent him from doing so anyway.\u00a0\n \u2026Which would be why they also have partners,  his brain grumbles at him.\nHe finds some ace bandage rolls in a plastic bag, but he\u2019s not sure how to make that work for a wound like this. He could switch to pure paper towels, but they disintegrate so quickly when they get soaked, and he really doesn\u2019t want to pick little towel fibers out of an open wound. Maybe he could just tape a washcloth back there or something? He\u2019s kind of running out of options here\u2026\nAs he riffles through the vanity drawers, Tim\u2019s hand closes around the handle of his mother\u2019s curling iron as he goes to move it aside, and the caution tag on its cord catches his eye. Evidently, on its highest setting, this particular model can reach temperatures of up to 400 degrees fahrenheit.\nNow  there\u2019s an idea\u2026\n\u201cWhat are you looking for, champ?\u201d\nAt the sound of his dad\u2019s voice, Tim shoves the curling iron back into the drawer. \u201cUh\u2026 shampoo!\u201d he says quickly, grabbing the nearest plastic bottle from under the sink. \u201cJust ran out of shampoo and wanted to shower.\u201d\nJack gazes judgingly at the sleek black bottle in his hand. \u201cWell, could you borrow your mother\u2019s instead? You know I get that stuff prescription for my dandruff.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yeah sure,\u201d Tim agrees with a nervous chuckle. \u201cNo problem.\u201d\nFrom the shower, Jack plucks up a bottle of something covered in flowers and labeled in French. He smirks, holding it out to Tim. \u201cNot the manliest scent, but it should tide you over until Mrs. Mac brings the groceries tomorrow.\u201d\nTim gives him a grateful smile. \u201cThanks.\u201d Stuffing the last of the items back into the vanity, he reaches up to the counter to pull himself up. The movement sends more fiery jolts of pain through his shoulder and he can\u2019t help but suck in a sharp breath as he gets to his feet.\nHis dad raises an eyebrow. \u201cAlright there?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Tim says tightly, feeling his eyes start to water. He blinks them clear again. \u201cI was just working out earlier. Arm day, you know...\u201d He forces a wet little laugh.\n(Tim will not be joining the Wayne Family Improv Troupe any time soon, that\u2019s for certain.)\nBut Jack chuckles anyway. \u201cGetting those gains in, eh? What are you benching these days?\u201d\nTim has no fucking clue what a thirteen-year-old boy is supposed to bench press. Outside of his P.E. class, he usually sticks to martial arts videos.\u00a0\n\u201cLike\u2026 a hundred\u2026?\u201d he tries. At Jack\u2019s frown, Tim quickly adds, \u201c\u2013and fifty! A hundred and fifty.\u201d\n(Just  please, please  don\u2019t ask for a demonstration right now. Tim will literally die.)\nJack looks vaguely disappointed. \u201cHm. I was doing at least two hundred at your age,\u201d he remarks, then pauses, seeming to chew this over. \u201cBut, I suppose I was quite a bit taller, too\u2026\u201d He nods after a moment, seemingly mollified. \u201cAlright, well, keep it up and you\u2019ll get those ladies in no time!\u201d\u00a0\nHe gives his son an encouraging clap on the back on his way out.\n(It\u2019s all Tim can do to keep from fainting.)\nIt\u2019s Friday night when Tim starts to suspect that something is wrong.\u00a0\nDespite the ibuprofen he\u2019s been popping like Skittles, the pain in his shoulder has only intensified, and it\u2019s warm and swollen to the point that he can\u2019t bear touching anywhere around the wound.\u00a0\nBut the worst part?\nIt just. Keeps. Re-opening.\u00a0\nNow, Tim\u2019s not stupid. He\u2019s well aware that these are probable signs of infection, which is why he\u2019s  dealing  with it. He found an expired tube of Neosporin in the back of a drawer somewhere that he\u2019s started applying liberally with every bandage change. Which, admittedly, he might not be doing as frequently as the articles say he\u2019s supposed to, but it\u2019s a  hassle,  okay?\u00a0\nFirst of all, there\u2019s the lack of bandages. He was really testing the bounds of that twelfth square of gauze before a YouTube ad for Kotex products combined with a sudden stroke of genius sent him rifling through his parents\u2019 bathroom drawers once more.\n(Thank god Janet\u2019s not a tampon person.)\nThere are sixteen pads left in Janet\u2019s stash. He risks snagging five of them, then hurries back to his own bathroom, hoodie pocket bulging and a darkly-ironic thought about coming of age somewhere in the back of his mind.\u00a0\nTo Tim\u2019s relief, the pads work pretty well as a gauze substitute. He\u2019ll still definitely have to ration if he doesn\u2019t want uncomfortable questions, but they\u2019re thick enough that he should be able to eek out a few more days until he can get the damn thing to close.\u00a0\nSecond, there\u2019s the issue of the wound\u2019s location. It\u2019s directly on the back of his shoulder, meaning that the only way he can see it is by looking in the mirror. Which wouldn\u2019t be a big deal or anything, except for the fact that\u2026\u00a0\nWell, he just really doesn\u2019t want to see it. \nIt\u2019s stupid. Tim knows it\u2019s stupid. He knows he\u2019s supposed to look at it\u2014to check it for weeping and yellow pus and red streaks and all the other nasty things the internet warns him about. But yet, some silly little voice in the back of Tim\u2019s head keeps telling him that so long as he just doesn\u2019t look, there\u2019s still a chance that this isn\u2019t really happening.\n(Schr\u00f6dinger's infection, if you will.)\nBecause\u2014and this is the third thing now\u2014it can\u2019t be happening. It simply cannot. Because if it is, it means that Tim needs a doctor, and he can\u2019t go to a doctor because they\u2019re going to ask what happened and contact his parents and maybe even the police and it\u2019s going to be a whole thing and nobody fucking needs that, least of all Jack and Janet.\nBecause they\u2019re finally home for once. They\u2019re home and they\u2019re being decent to him, and eating dinner with him, and it\u2019s winter break, and despite their jam-packed calendars, they even remembered to light the menorah with him five nights out of eight. They\u2019re  here, dammit, and Tim is not about to make them wish they weren\u2019t.\nSo he just deals with it. He rinses the wound off with warm water and covers it in ointment and duct tapes maxi pads to the top and prays it\u2019ll just sort itself out. Because it has to.\nIt has to.\nExcept it doesn\u2019t.\u00a0\nBy Saturday, Tim feels like hot garbage. He\u2019s exhausted, he\u2019s chilled, he\u2019s achy, his stomach is off, and his shoulder is  on fucking fire. \nHe\u2019s also supposed to attend the GCPD\u2019s Annual Winter Ball that evening.\n(Because, fuck Tim\u2019s life, honestly.)\n\u201cCan\u2019t I please stay home, just this once?\u201d Tim begs as his mother hands over the dry cleaning bag containing his freshly pressed tux. \u201cI\u2019ll go to the next one, I promise.\u201d\nJanet sighs, hard and exasperated. \u201cTimothy, it\u2019s the biggest event of the season. Drake Industries stock has only just recovered from that whole Bialyian border fiasco over the summer. It\u2019s imperative that our family display a united front tonight to reassert our commitment to local law enforcement and wholesome family values.\u201d\n(He\u2019s just going to suspend the irony of that for a minute.)\n\u201cI know, but I\u2019m just not feeling very well,\u201d he says truthfully. He\u2019d woken up that morning sweaty and nauseous, his shoulder screaming at him with every movement. \u201cI think I might be coming down with something\u2026\u201d\nJanet\u2019s gaze narrows. \u201cYou think you\u2019re coming down with something,\u201d she repeats skeptically. \u201cAnd yet, I\u2019ve not heard a single cough, sneeze, or sniffle out of you all day.\u201d\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s not a cold, exactly,\u201d Tim argues, letting his good arm wrap around his middle. \u201cIt\u2019s more like, you know\u2026\u201d\u00a0\n(A gaping, infected stab wound in his back that refuses to close no matter what he does.)\n\u201c...a stomach thing,\u201d he finishes lamely.\n\u201cA stomach thing.\u201d Janet is fixing him with that very particular look of hers that makes him feel like a bug under a microscope. \u201cHave you thrown up?\u201d\n\u201cWell, no,\u201d he admits. \u201cBut\u2013\u201d\n\u201cAre you having diarrhea?\u201d\nHe grimaces.  \u201cNo,  but\u2013\u201d\nShe cuts him off with a sigh. \u201cTimothy, your father and I negotiated our largest company merger to date while I was in the throes of Dengue fever after that botched trip to Thailand back in \u201807. I gave a three-hour presentation to two separate boards of directors with a fever of 103.8 degrees. I was  hallucinating my late mother  sitting in the corner of the boardroom for the entire second half of the meeting, and do you know what?\u201d She pauses a beat. \u201cNot a  single person suspected it.\u201d\u00a0\nCrossing her arms, she looks him straight in the eyes. \u201cNow, for the sake of the very company that puts food on our table, are you honestly telling me that you can\u2019t push through for one night because your  tummy hurts?\u201d\u00a0 \nA lump settles in Tim\u2019s throat. His eyes start to sting. It\u2019s true what he told Bruce that day in November; his parents have never once hit him.\u00a0\n\n They don\u2019t have to. \n\nSwallowing hard, Tim takes a steadying breath.  Focus,  he reminds himself.  Remember your audience. Speak their language. \n\u201cI\u2019m just concerned that I won\u2019t be able to put my best foot forward tonight,\u201d he begins carefully. He\u2019s searching his mother\u2019s face for tells\u2014gauging her reaction to each word. \u201cWith so many notable names on the guest list, the last thing I want to do is let anyone down.\u201d\u00a0\nIt\u2019s subtle, but it\u2019s there\u2014the shift in his mother\u2019s features, the little flicker of something like uncertainty as she weighs his words. Tim plays his trump card:\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019d hate to risk becoming a liability rather than an asset.\u201d\n\u2026And that\u2019s how Tim finds himself seated on the edge of his parents\u2019 bathtub five minutes later, the thermometer reading 100 degrees on the dot.\nJanet looks unimpressed.\n\u201cWell that\u2019s not even clinically significant, is it,\u201d she dismisses, sliding the thermometer back into its case. \u201cProbably more to do with all those layers you\u2019re wearing than anything else\u2026\u201d\u00a0\nShe casts a judging gaze at the thick black sweatshirt Tim\u2019s been living in for the past few days. A little more casual than his usual style, but it\u2019s really good at hiding blood stains.\n\u201cI took some ibuprofen earlier,\u201d Tim admits, quickly growing desperate enough to avoid this evening that he\u2019s willing to risk a little more of his mother\u2019s scrutiny. \u201cThat\u2019s probably why it\u2019s not any higher.\u201d\u00a0\n(It must be that; he sure as hell feels shittier than a measly 100 degrees would account for.)\nJanet, however, just nods approvingly. \u201cGood. Bring some more with you in case those wear off.\u201d She replaces the thermometer and closes the medicine cabinet. \u201cNow go get changed\u2014we leave in thirty minutes.\u201d\nThe gala is, in a word, hell.\nNow, Tim knew it would be hell of course. He\u2019d thoroughly anticipated how the stuffy clothing would hug tightly to his back, pressing right up against his inflamed skin; how his fever would leave him sweaty and miserable, cycling from cold, to hot, to cold again; how the smells of the fancy hor d'oeuvres would turn his stomach; how the camera flashes and boisterous laughter of the guests would drill into his aching head; how he\u2019d be roped into one conversation after another, pasting on smiles and nodding politely to whatever meaningless socialite gossip is hot tonight.\u00a0\nHe\u2019d been prepared for all of that.\nBut somehow, Tim had forgotten about the  handshakes. The dozens upon dozens of times that he\u2019s forced to extend his screaming right arm, clasp someone\u2019s hand firmly in his own, and pump it up and down, his Gala Smile\u2122 pasted on so tightly that it\u2019s making his face twitch.\n(Better than crying, at least.)\nTim\u2019s not entirely sure what it is that catches up with him in the end\u2014the pain, the fever, or simply the fact that he\u2019s taken  far too many  pills on a  far too empty stomach\u2014but he barely makes it two hours into the gala before the single piece of toast he\u2019s eaten today starts threatening to make a reappearance. He does his best to will it back down, breathing carefully through his slightly-open mouth and sipping ginger ale from a champagne flute as he follows his parents around from one mind-numbing conversation to the next. But when the back of his jaw starts to tingle, Tim knows it\u2019s game over. He interrupts Mrs. Bennet\u2019s recount of her family\u2019s recent trip to an Italian villa with a murmured apology before speed walking to the nearest men\u2019s room.\nOnce inside, he barely manages to shut the stall door behind him before dropping to his knees and retching into the toilet. Tim\u2019s not sure which burns the most: his stomach, his throat, or his shoulder.\u00a0\n(Just kidding. It\u2019s definitely the shoulder.)\nThere isn\u2019t much in him to bring up, but that certainly doesn\u2019t stop his body from trying. Tim\u2019s still retching miserably when he hears the outer door to the bathroom creak open.\u00a0\n Great,  he thinks bitterly, because an audience is  exactly what Tim needs right now. If he\u2019s lucky, they\u2019ll just turn around and find another bathroom. Amongst the social elite, pretending not to notice another\u2019s public humiliation is by far the most merciful course of action.\nBut of course, Tim\u2019s never been particularly lucky.\u00a0\nThere\u2019s a moment\u2019s hesitation before he hears a quiet knock against the door of the stall. \u201cUm, sir?\u201d the stupid Good Samaritan asks. \u201cAre you alright in there? Can I get you some water or something?\u201d\nWait, hold on. Tim knows that voice.\n\u201c...J-Jason?\u201d he croaks.\n\u201cWait, Tim?\u201d The other boy sounds at least as surprised as Tim is. \u201cShit, is that you? I didn\u2019t even know you were gonna be here tonight. Are you sick?\u201d\nTim opens his mouth to respond, but all that comes out is another retch.\n\u201cRight, okay, stupid question. Fuck\u2026\u201d Jason sighs. Tim can practically see him running his hand through his hair as he thinks. \u201cJust wait here, alright? I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d\n(Well it\u2019s not like Tim can go anywhere else\u2026)\nHe\u2019s just getting his breath back from his second round of heaving when the bathroom door opens again.\u00a0\n\u201cHey, I\u2019m back,\u201d Jason announces, briskly closing the distance between himself and the stall. \u201cCan you open the door? I brought you some water and a Certified Legal Adult.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Tim reaches up, fingers fumbling for the latch. The stall door swings open to reveal not only Jason, but Bruce Wayne, dressed to the fucking nines.\n(Someone, please, just kill Tim now.)\n\u201cHey Tim,\u201d Bruce greets softly. He\u2019s got that same sympathetic half-smile on his face that Dick wears sometimes. Tim wonders idly who taught it to whom. \u201cJason says you\u2019re not feeling too hot.\u201d\n\u201cTechnically I said he was blowing chunks,\u201d Jason quips, receiving an unamused look from his father. Reaching towards Tim, he holds out a fluted glass filled with water.\u00a0\nTim takes it carefully, praying he won\u2019t drop it. That\u2019d be just what he needs to add to this evening\u2019s growing list of social sins: property damage.\u00a0\n\u201cSo, what\u2019s the deal?\u201d Jason asks as Tim takes a cautious sip. \u201cAre you sick-sick, or is this more of a \u2018don\u2019t try the escargot\u2019 kind of thing?\u201d\nTim\u2019s stomach rolls. He shoves the glass back into Jason\u2019s hand before pressing his fist against his lips, barely suppressing a gag.\nBruce sighs\u2014that particular, exasperated one that only his children are capable of bringing out of him. \u201cThank you, Jay, I\u2019ll take it from here,\u201d he says flatly. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go see if you can track down the Drakes?\u201d\nJason\u2019s nose wrinkles up in obvious displeasure. \u201cDo I have to?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d Bruce gives him a significant look. \u201cTell them Tim\u2019s not feeling very well and he needs to go home. Wait for us in the lobby.\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d Jason huffs, turning to leave.\n\u201cAnd I want you to use those exact words,\u201d Bruce calls after him. \u201cNothing less, nothing more.\u201d\n\n \u201cAlright, alright\u2026\u201d \n\nOnce the door shuts behind him again, Bruce tugs the front of his trousers up slightly, allowing him enough room to squat down to Tim\u2019s level. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, bud?\u201d he asks gently.\nTim swallows hard. \u201cSorry, Jason didn\u2019t have to get you, I\u2019m fine now,\u201d he mumbles, thoroughly embarrassed. \u201cI think it was just something I ate.\u201d\n(Yeah, like a dozen tabs of ibuprofen.)\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Bruce\u2019s brow furrows in concern. He presses a cool hand to Tim\u2019s forehead, causing him to shiver at the contact. \u201cYou feel a little warm\u2026\u201d And sweaty, Tim knows, though Bruce is kind enough not to mention it. \u201cDoes anything hurt?\u201d\nTim hesitates. Everything  fucking hurts. He\u2019s miserable enough at this point that there\u2019s a part of him that\u2019s tempted to come clean\u2014to tell Bruce what happened and just let the adults handle this for once. But there would be so many questions, and Tim won\u2019t be able to answer them. Not tonight. Not in a public bathroom at the biggest event of the season.\nNot when the last thing in the world his parents need from him is a scene.\nHe shakes his head, forcing a sheepish smile. \u201cI\u2019m okay. I think I just needed to get something out of my system. I feel a lot better now.\u201d\u00a0\nBruce doesn\u2019t look very convinced, but he nods anyway and takes Tim\u2019s good arm to help him to his feet. The movement, though gentle, jostles Tim\u2019s back and he has to bite the inside of his cheek to keep his expression neutral.\u00a0\nHe must not do a very good job of it because Bruce goes instantly still. \u201cWhat hurts, Tim.\u201d\u00a0\nIt\u2019s less of a question and more of a command. He clearly isn\u2019t buying \u2018nothing,\u2019 so Tim opts for a technically accurate though incomplete version of the truth.\u00a0\nHe sighs. \u201cJust, like, everything.\u201d At Bruce\u2019s creased forehead, he huffs out a bleak little laugh. \u201cLike, my whole body kinda aches, you know?\u201d\u00a0\n(But particularly, the duct-taped stab wound.)\nBruce\u2019s worried expression softens into more of a sympathetic grimace. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound much like food poisoning,\u201d he says gently, and given that whole \u2018Parm-o-nella\u2019 business Jason graphically recounted for him a couple weeks ago, Tim supposes a Wayne should know. \u201cI think you might have the flu.\u201d\nTim bites his lower lip. \u201cYeah, maybe,\u201d he says after a moment.\nThe lie burns in his chest.\nLeaving the stall, Tim shuffles over to sinks and cleans up the best he can. He looks about as bad as he feels, but at least he managed to avoid getting anything on his clothes. He washes his face and straightens his tie before following Bruce back out to the lobby.\nJason is waiting there with Tim\u2019s parents. None of them seem particularly pleased with their current company. The second Jack and Janet see him, they immediately converge on their son.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d his mother demands.\u00a0\nJack seems flustered, no doubt from being pulled away from whatever business deal he\u2019d been in the midst of orchestrating. \u201cYes, what\u2019s this about you needing to leave all of a sudden?\u201d\n\u201cI, um\u2026\u201d Tim can\u2019t quite meet his parents\u2019 gaze. \u201cI\u2019m sick. I threw up,\u201d he admits. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry.\u201d\nJanet\u2019s nose twitches, like she\u2019s trying very hard not to grimace. \u201cWhere?\u201d she asks sharply.\nJason\u2019s brow furrows, but the bluntness of the question doesn\u2019t faze Tim in the slightest. \u201cIn the bathroom,\u201d he\u2019s quick to reassure her. \u201cI didn\u2019t make a mess or anything, I swear. And I\u2019m pretty sure the Waynes were the only ones who noticed me.\u201d\nJack raises an eyebrow. \u201cThink there\u2019ll be an encore?\u201d\nTim\u2019s cheeks are burning. He shakes his head, and both his parents nod.\u00a0\n\u201cWell, not ideal, but it certainly could be worse\u2026\u201d Janet murmurs to her husband. Then, turning to Bruce, she fixes him with a proper Gala Smile\u2122. \u201cThank you very much for alerting us to the situation, Mr. Wayne,\u201d she says smoothly. \u201cWe\u2019ll see to it that Timothy is looked after.\u201d\n\u201cOf course, Janet,\u201d Bruce says, matching her silky tone. \u201cMy son and I would be happy to retrieve your belongings from the cloakroom for you while you help Tim outside. I\u2019m sure the fresh air will do him good.\u201d\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s terribly kind of you, but we\u2019re quite alright,\u201d she declines, her words dripping with artificial sweetness. \u201cCome along, dear,\u201d she addresses Tim, taking his elbow and nudging him back in the direction of the banquet hall. \u201cWe\u2019ll ask one of the waiters to bring you some crackers\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWait,  what?\u201d  Jason blurts. Bruce shoots his son a warning look, which he completely ignores. \u201cYou\u2019re not taking him home?\u201d\n\u201cWell we certainly will when the night is over!\u201d Jack says with a chuckle, as though leaving his son at a gala were a preposterous idea and not something he\u2019d literally been guilty of eight months prior. \u201cBut it\u2019s only half-past seven. We haven\u2019t even made it to the charity auction yet.\u201d\nTim\u2019s heart sinks. Of course his parents would want to stay for the auction. Not only were the two of them planning to bid on several items, but they\u2019d also personally donated a few pieces from their own collection and would be eager to see how much they fetched.\u00a0\n(For charity, of course. Certainly not because of the generous interviews the press always conducted with benefactors afterwards.)\nJason\u2019s face twists into a scowl, but Bruce is quick to intervene, placing a firm hand on the boy\u2019s shoulder. \u201cNow Jack,\u201d he addresses Tim\u2019s father in his most diplomatic tone, \u201cwhile I certainly admire your commitment to philanthropy, the auction doesn\u2019t even begin for another hour and a half. Surely no one here would fault you for prioritizing a family member\u2019s health over a bit of public charity.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nBoth of Tim\u2019s parents hesitate just a second too long. Janet\u2019s fingers wrap a little tighter around his elbow.\n\u201cWell he seems perfectly fine now,\u201d Jack retorts, clearly ruffled by the direction this conversation is taking. \u201cAren\u2019t you, champ?\u201d He locks eyes with Tim.\n\u201cUh huh\u2026\u201d Tim really just wants to sit down. All this arguing is making his stomach hurt again.\n\u201cSee?\u201d Jack says with a little chuckle. \u201cNothing to worry about.\u201d\nThat\u2019s apparently the last straw for Jason. \u201cOh my god, what is  wrong  with you people?\u201d he exclaims. \u201cYour kid was literally just puking his guts up!\u201d\n \u201cShh.\u201d Janet\u2019s eyes dart around the room, obviously checking for any turned heads. \u201cWe are in public, young man,\u201d she says sternly, keeping her voice low. \u201cKindly watch your language.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bodily function!\u201d\n\u201cJay\u2026\u201d Bruce pinches the bridge of his nose. \u201cWould you please just let me handle this?\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d Jason snaps, turning on Bruce now while Tim\u2019s stomach twists uncomfortably, \u201cBecause I have been letting you handle this since fucking  April,  and what have you done about it?  Not a damn thing.\u201d \nBruce looks pained. \u201cThis is not the place to discuss\u2013\u201d\n\u201cWell where is that place then, B? \u2018Cus let\u2019s fucking go there then!\u201d\nHeads are turning all around the lobby now. Tim tries to pull away, but Janet\u2019s grip on his elbow only tightens. \u201c...Mom?\u201d he whispers. \u201cI really don\u2019t feel\u2013\u201d\n\u201cHush, Timothy,\u201d she snaps under her breath at the same moment that his father turns on Bruce.\n\u201cDiscuss what?\u201d Jack demands hotly. \u201cWhat precisely is your boy trying to insinuate here?\u201d\nBruce holds up a placating hand. \u201cNow, Jack, let\u2019s all just take a deep breath and\u2013\u201d\n\u201cI am  insinuating,\u201d Jason spits out, getting right up in Jack\u2019s face, \u201cthat you treat your own child like  dirt!\u201d \n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Janet whips her head around, while Jack just splutters, open-mouthed.\n\u201cNo, you know what?  Worse  than dirt! Because at least you\u2019d probably  notice  dirt, and you\u2019d give enough of a shit  about the dirt that you\u2019d  hire someone  to take care of it!\u201d\nPretty much the entire room is staring at them now. Jack looks as angry as he had that day he\u2019d fired Tim\u2019s nanny. \u201cHow dare you speak to us like\u2013\u201d\nTim\u2019s stomach lurches. He twists his arm, desperately trying to escape his mother\u2019s grip. \u201cMom\u2013\u201d\n\u201cQuiet, Timothy,\u201d she snaps.\nAnd that\u2019s when Tim loses it.\nAll.\u00a0\nOver.\u00a0\nJanet\u2019s.\u00a0\nDress.\n(The silver lining is that his parents take him straight home after that.)\nIf the gala was hell, then the car ride home is purgatory.\nFor twenty-five minutes, Tim is trapped in a moving vehicle\u2014sick, humiliated, hurting, and miserable\u2014just waiting for his parents to go off on him.\u00a0\nExcept they never get around to it. They\u2019re far too hung up on Jason Todd.\n\u201c\u2013that uncultured, belligerent, trust-fund stealing little  punk of a\u2013\u201d\n\u201c\u2013to imply that we are providing  anything less  than the very  highest  quality of\u2013\u201d\n\u201c\u2013why, simply on education  alone,  we\u2019ve spent upwards of\u2013\u201d\n\u201c\u2013and with everything we\u2019ve given back to this community over the years\u2013\u201d\n\u201c\u2013the amount of negative publicity that this will generate is frankly\u2013\u201d\n\u201c\u2013lies! Not an ounce of truth to what he\u2013\u201d\nTim just sits there, silent tears slipping down his cheeks. He doesn\u2019t even know who he\u2019s most upset with: Jason for picking a fight in public, Bruce for not stopping him, his parents for escalating things, or himself for getting into this whole fucking mess in the first place.\u00a0\nBy the time the car rolls to a stop in the Drakes\u2019 garage, his parents are so caught up in their rant that they don\u2019t even seem to notice Tim getting out. He makes it all the way up to his bedroom without so much as a word from either of them.\u00a0\nWhich is fine of course. It\u2019s not like he wants them to yell at him or launch into a lecture on proper decorum in public\u2014that would be horrible. Nor does he want to look at the vomit stains on his mother\u2019s dress a second longer than he absolutely has to. Honestly, as humiliating as the whole thing was, Tim should be grateful to Jason that his outburst has him playing scapegoat tonight because it means Tim\u2019s off the hook for once.\nIt\u2019s just that\u2013\u00a0\nNo. It\u2019s stupid. He knows it\u2019s stupid. He\u2019s thirteen, not three. His parents trust him, that\u2019s all it is. They know he\u2019s capable of sorting himself out.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s just that\u2013\n\n They didn\u2019t even ask Tim if he was okay. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t know why he cares. The question would be superfluous anyway; anyone with eyes could see he wasn\u2019t. He\u2019d obviously needed to leave, and his parents had gotten him out. Problem solved, case closed.\u00a0\nBut\u2013\nBut the Waynes had asked anyway. They were all, \u2018holy shit, are you okay\u2019 and \u2018just breathe for a second, bud\u2019 and \u2018I\u2019m so sorry, dude\u2019 and \u2018let me get your coats\u2019 and about twelve other things that had felt really overwhelming in the moment, but in hindsight were actually kind of sweet. Even the staff who\u2019d hurried over to clean up briefly inquired about Tim\u2019s well-being. Nosy old Mrs. McBurry had popped by to check on them. Hell, a pair of reporters from the Daily Planet had winced in sympathy and handed Tim a water bottle and a stack of napkins on his way out the door.\nMeanwhile, Janet had been focused on her dress, and Jack was busy trying to avoid the paparazzi. They\u2019d ushered Tim out to the car as quickly as possible and as a result they just\u2013\nNever asked.\nAgain, Tim isn\u2019t sure why he cares. It\u2019s not like he would have told them the truth if they had\u2014how could he have? If anything, this just makes his job easier. His parents can just assume Tim\u2019s caught some kind of bug, Tim can handle things himself, and nobody has to find out about the gaping hole in his back.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s perfect. Really, Tim lucked out.\n\u2026So why does it still make his chest ache?\nWhen Tim wakes up, he immediately knows he\u2019s sick-sick.\nHe\u2019s lying in his bed in a puddle of sweat, pain radiating from his shoulder all the way down his arm and across his back. He\u2019d meant to change the pad last night, but his mother had gone in to take a shower before he had the chance to swipe any more supplies from her bathroom and he must\u2019ve fallen asleep waiting.\u00a0\nHe should really get up now\u2014take a shower and put on more Neosporin. Hopefully it\u2019ll have stopped bleeding by today, and if not, whatever. He\u2019ll just ruin a shirt.\nThe clock on his nightstand reads 8:12 a.m.\nHe blinks once, and it says 10:09.\nFrowning, Tim starts untangling himself from the damp sheets. It seems to take only a few seconds, yet by the time he\u2019s free, the clock reads 10:45.\nHe shakes his head slowly to clear it. He really needs to get up and shower. After all, the grandfather clock downstairs is already chiming noon.\nWait,  noon? \nThere\u2019s a knock at his bedroom door. \u201cTimothy it\u2019s two o\u2019clock,\u201d his mother calls in exasperation. \u201cI know you\u2019re sick, but you\u2019ve got to get up sometime.\u201d\nTim rubs his forehead tiredly. Nothing is making sense. \u201cI\u2019m up,\u201d he croaks back.\nHer footsteps have barely finished retreating before there\u2019s another knock\u2014louder this time. \u201cIt\u2019s after three, champ!\u201d Jack hollers from outside the door. \u201cYou\u2019re wasting your entire day!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m up,\u201d Tim insists, and gets dizzily to his feet.\nAt 3:29, he limps to the bathroom and flips on the shower, sitting down on the toilet to wait for the water to warm up.\nAt 5:04 p.m, he gives up on the shower, turning the still-cold water off again.\nHe uses the bathroom briefly, then emerges at 6:10 p.m. There\u2019s a mug of over-steeped tea and a packet of crackers on his nightstand beside a yellow post-it note in Janet\u2019s handwriting:\u00a0\n\n Heading to the airport now. Flight leaves at 9:00. Feel better, dear. \n\nTim smiles weakly as he crawls back into bed. That\u2019s nice. He can\u2019t remember the last time his mother made him tea.\nTim opens his eyes and he\u2019s on  fire. \nHe\u2019s burning up from the inside out, skin prickling, sheets licking him like flames, shoulder throbbing in time with his heartbeat. But that\u2019s not the worst part.\nThe worst part is that someone is crying.\nIt\u2019s a heartbreaking sound: mostly whimpers, interspersed with choked sobs. He\u2019s not sure where it\u2019s coming from\u2014he can\u2019t quite bear to lift his head and look\u2014but whoever it is, they sound close. Someone should help them.\n\n Why isn\u2019t anyone helping them? \n\n\u201cH-Hello?\u201d Tim forces out, surprised to hear his own breath hitching. His pillow is wet. Why is his pillow wet when everything else feels so dry? \u201cWho\u2019s\u2026 th-there?\u201d\nBut the whimpers only continue.\nThey sound so pathetic\u2014so utterly miserable. Tim should help them. He should get up, get them water or something.  God,  water sounds amazing right now\u2014he\u2019s so thirsty. But his muscles are screaming and he\u2019s burning and the person just keeps crying. \u00a0\n\n Why won\u2019t they stop crying? \n\n\u201c...M-Mom?\u201d he calls out, then listens for her footsteps. He tries again, louder:  \u201cMom.\u201d \nShe doesn\u2019t come.\n\u201cD\u2013D-Dad?\u201d The crying just gets louder and louder. The person is really starting to annoy him now. He wants to snap at them\u2014to tell them to shut up so he can make his parents hear him, but that seems mean.\u00a0\n\u201cMom\u2026 Dad\u2026\u201d Tim sobs.\nHis face is wet like his pillow and everything else is so, so dry. He licks his cracked lips and tastes blood.\nThe crying is what lulls him back to sleep.\n\n \u201c...Blackbird singing in the dead of night\u2026\u201d \n\nGentle fingers card through Tim\u2019s hair as Ms. Sophie\u2019s sweet soprano voice fills the room.\n\n \u201c...Take these broken wings and learn to fly\u2026\u201d \n\nBruce Wayne is a moron.\nNow, don\u2019t get Jason wrong\u2014he loves the guy, he really does. He\u2019s kind, and caring, and strong, and committed, and fiercely protective of those he loves. He\u2019s easily miles above Willis or any of the other pathetic father-figures Jason\u2019s had in his life up until now.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s just that, sometimes, he\u2019s also a  fucking moron. \n\u201cLook at this! Just look at this!\u201d Jason slams his phone down on Bruce\u2019s desk, using his thumb to scroll through his text thread with Tim, the last seven messages of which have all gone unanswered. \u201cTwo days! The gala was  two days ago and he hasn\u2019t replied to me once since!\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s sick, Jay,\u201d Bruce says for the fourth time. \u201cHe\u2019s got the flu.\u201d\nJason rolls his eyes. \u201cIf he\u2019s sick enough that he can\u2019t take three seconds to reply to the  fucking hilarious  and  historically accurate meme I sent him, then we should be checking in on him anyway.\u201d\u00a0\nBruce leans forward and squints at the phone screen. \u201cWhy is our sixteenth president chasing Robert Pattinson through the woods with an ax?\u201d\nJason throws his hands up in exasperation. \u201cBecause he\u2019s a vampire hunter, B! Stop nodding off during movie night for once and you\u2019d know that!\u201d\nAt his father\u2019s quizzical look, Jason huffs out in exasperation, \u201cLook, the point is that  Tim would laugh, okay? He would send me a \u2018lol\u2019 or an \u2018lmao\u2019 or a couple of those stupid skull and crossbones emojis. What he would not do is leave me hanging for forty-eight hours straight, especially after I followed up with a \u2018u good bro?\u2019! Everyone knows you don\u2019t just leave someone hanging on a \u2018u good bro?\u2019!  \u201d \n\u201cJason,\u201d Bruce sighs. \u201cI hear you. I really do. And if he were home alone right now, I would absolutely agree to a welfare check. But the fact of the matter is, his parents are with him this time.\u201d\nJason scowls. \u201cHis parents are assholes who don\u2019t give a single shit about him!\u201d\nClosing his eyes, Bruce blows out a carefully measured breath.\n\u201cI understand that that\u2019s how you feel about them,\u201d he begins. Jason scoffs, about to launch in again, but Bruce doesn\u2019t let him, \u201cAnd, after that stunt you pulled the other night, so do a couple hundred of Gotham\u2019s wealthiest and most-powerful citizens\u2013\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d Jason seethes. Those fuckwads posing as parents deserve all the negative publicity they can get.\n\u201c...Which is likely also why Tim isn\u2019t returning your messages at the moment,\u201d Bruce concludes.\nJason blinks at him. \u201cWait, what?\u201d\u00a0\nBruce sighs again; he seems to have aged at least five years in those two days since that gala.\u00a0\n\u201cJay, lad,\u201d he begins gently, \u201cI know that you did what you did with the very best of intentions. You had reason to believe that someone you cared about was being mistreated, and you weren\u2019t going to sit by and let that happen. And I admire that about you, son, I really do.\u201d\u00a0\n(Jason knows a \u2018but\u2019 is coming.)\n\u201cBut in doing so, you also yelled at Tim\u2019s parents in front of an entire gala full of people. And I know you think that they deserved that,\u201d he adds quickly before Jason can butt in to say exactly that, \u201cand maybe they did. But do you know who definitely  didn\u2019t  deserve that?\u201d\nRealization hits Jason like a Mack truck.\u00a0\n\u201cOh fuck,\u201d he breathes out, eyes wide with horror.  \u201cTim.\u201d \nBruce looks up at him, eyes full of hurt. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to let his parents keep him there all night, Jay\u2014I hope you know me better than that. One way or another, we were going to get Tim home. But the goal was to do it without attracting a few hundred people\u2019s attention to him right before what was probably the most embarrassing moment of his life.\u201d He runs a hand over his face tiredly.  \u201cThat  is why I wanted you to let me handle it.\u201d\nAs quickly as the anger had come over him, Jason can feel it all running back out now.\u00a0 He sinks down into one of the cushioned office chairs, utterly dismayed.\u00a0\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even think of that,\u201d he admits in a whisper.\u00a0\nHe really should\u2019ve. This is  Tim  they\u2019re talking about, after all. Tim, whose entire life goal seems to be summed up in \u2018don\u2019t bother anyone\u2019 and \u2018don\u2019t make a scene.\u2019 Jason had been so focused on the fact that no one was taking Tim\u2019s feelings or wellbeing into account that he\u2019d\u2013\n...accidentally done the exact same thing.\n(Maybe Bruce isn\u2019t the only moron in the room.)\nGetting up from his seat, Bruce walks around the desk and places a hand on his son\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI know, Jay. And I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll come around. He probably just needs some space right now.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Jason sighs. \u201cYou\u2019re probably right\u2026\u201d\nSix hours later, Jason\u2019s climbing the trellis outside Tim\u2019s bedroom window.\nIt\u2019s a stupid idea. He realizes that before he\u2019s even halfway up. If Tim doesn\u2019t want to talk to him, then he doesn\u2019t want to talk to him. Jason should be like, \u2018respecting boundaries\u2019 or whatever Dinah calls it\u2014not skipping patrol, trekking a mile across the grounds, and shimmying up two stories to pop into his sick neighbor\u2019s bedroom window and force an apology on him.\u00a0\nBut Jason\u2019s never been particularly good at boundaries.\nAlso, the more he considers Bruce\u2019s words, the more he\u2019s starting to second guess them. Not the part about how he shouldn\u2019t have cussed the Drakes out in public, thereby putting the spotlight on a sick kid two seconds before he ralphed everywhere. Jason has to admit he\u2019d fucked up there.\nBut the part about Tim holding a grudge because of it and pulling that whole \u2018silent treatment\u2019 shit? Now  that\u2019s  the part that doesn\u2019t really track.\nGranted, Jason would certainly pull that shit if he were mad at someone\u2014in fact, he\u2019s done it many times. So has Dick. Hell, even Bruce will passive-aggressively express his displeasure by reverting to a series of non-verbal grunts instead of words.\u00a0\nBut  Tim??\nThat boy is so fucking attention-starved that he regularly gossips with a seventy-two-year-old lady about which of their neighbors has the scraggliest rose bushes. The idea of him willingly choosing to cut off communication with someone just to make a point about how upset he is\u2014\nWell, Jason\u2019s not saying it\u2019s  impossible  or anything, but it certainly does seem\u2026  fishy. \nErgo, up the trellis he climbs.\nPulling himself up the last few feet, Jason reaches eye-level with the window. There isn\u2019t much light in the room, but he can make out a lump on the bed in a tangle of sheets that he assumes must be Tim. The lower half keeps shifting around\u2014small, restless movements, like he\u2019s trying to kick his covers off but doesn\u2019t quite have the energy to finish the job.\u00a0\n Feverish,  Jason mentally catalogs. Definitely feverish.\u00a0\nThere\u2019s a trash can beside the bed, and a mug of something on the nightstand\u2014tea, judging from the string wrapped around the handle which he can just make out in the moonlight. Point for the Drakes, he supposes.\nJason sighs. Maybe Bruce was right after all. The kid is clearly sick. He should just give Tim space and make it up to him once he\u2019s feeling better.\u00a0\nBut then Jason\u2019s gaze falls on a yellow post-it note on the nightstand right below the window, and the glowing numbers on Tim\u2019s alarm clock provide just enough light for Jason to make out the words:\n\n Heading to the airport now. Flight leaves at 9:00. Feel better, dear. \n\n\u201cOh like fuck they are\u2026\u201d Jason growls.\n(Looks like this stalker mission just turned into a B&amp;E.)\n\u201c...Tim. Tim\u2026\u201d \nSomeone is standing in Tim\u2019s bedroom. His vision is too hazy to make out their features, but he can see their general shape in front of him. Tim doesn\u2019t think they\u2019re the same person who\u2019s been crying for hours\u2014their tone is all different. Sharp and urgent rather than pathetic and scared.\n\u201c...Tim!\u201d\nThey\u2019re saying other things, too. Some of them sound like questions, some like reassurances, some almost like orders, but it\u2019s too hard to focus on the actual words while Tim\u2019s on fire.\nHe can feel the crunchy sheets untangling from his legs, followed by a cool hand against his cheek, and suddenly Tim doesn\u2019t even care who this person is\u2014they\u2019re his new favorite.\n\u201c...get you\u2026 water. Where are\u2026 parents?\u201d\nThe blessedly cool hand removes itself from his face, and someone lets out a whine.\u00a0\n\u201cShh\u2026 it\u2019s okay...right back\u2026\u201d\nThere are footsteps walking away, and then the distant sound of his bathroom faucet flipping on. Just as quickly as the person left, they\u2019re back again, but this time the hand reaches for Tim\u2019s shoulder as if to sit him up.\u00a0\nSomeone screams. \n\u201cFuck, sorry! What\u2019s that on your\u2013?\u201d\nFingers brush against the dressing, and another blood-curdling wail echoes throughout the room, choked off into a sob.\n\u201cSorry\u2026 really sorry, but I need to\u2026\u201d\nTim hears someone sobbing now.\n\u201cAlmost got it, just need to see\u2013\u201d\u00a0\nThey cut themselves off sharply, and the putrid scent of rot hits Tim\u2019s nose.\n\u201cHoly fuck.\u201d\nAnd just like that, the person\u2019s voice changes. Not entirely, but just enough that Tim recognizes it when it drops into something deeper, clearer, sharper:\n\u201c...Ambulance\u2026 1006 Mountain Drive, Bristol\u2026 Thirteen-year-old male\u2026 Infected wound\u2026 Right shoulder\u2026 Respiration rapid\u2026 Pulse thready\u2026\u201d\nThat\u2019s the moment when Tim realizes who\u2019s standing in his bedroom.\n \u201cRobin,\u201d  he sobs with relief. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 You\u2019re  Robin.\u201d \nThere\u2019s a short little huff of air as fingers reach up to card through his hair. \u201cFuck yeah I am, dude.\u201d\n(That\u2019s the last thing Tim is aware of for quite a while.)\nFor three full days, no one can get a hold of Jack and Janet Drake\u2014and not for lack of trying. Flight records and government permits indicate they\u2019re on a dig in a remote area of Markovia, cut off from all cell service, internet signal, and most other forms of communication.\u00a0\nThey\u2019ve also made absolutely no arrangements for their knowingly-ill thirteen-year-old son.\nTim wakes up in an ICU bed at Gotham General as a ward of the state of New Jersey.\nA light knocking pulls Tim from his thoughts. He turns his head to see Bruce standing in the doorway of the private room he was transferred to earlier that morning\u2014before social services spent a good hour talking to him\u2014looking almost as exhausted as Tim feels.\u00a0\n\"Hey, bud,\" he says softly. \"Mind if I come in?\"\nTim doesn't have it in him to speak, so he just nods. It makes his feverish head pound even harder. Some of it must show in his expression because Bruce frowns as he carries a chair over to the side of the bed.\u00a0\n\"You're in pain.\"\n\"I'm fine,\" Tim croaks. He clears his throat and adds, \"I was handling it.\"\n\u201cYou were,\u201d Bruce says quietly, not even pretending to misunderstand him. \u201cBut you shouldn\u2019t have had to.\u201d\n(Tim says nothing to that.)\nBruce sighs. Between all the IVs, cannulas, and catheters, Tim\u2019s got at least half a dozen tubes running into and out of him, so it takes a second for Bruce to find a free part of his arm to squeeze.\n\u201cMy lawyers are just finishing up the last of the paperwork now. The doctors say you\u2019re responding well to the antibiotics. It\u2019ll probably be a couple more days before we can get you discharged, but the boys and I are really looking forward to bringing you home. Alfred too.\u201d\nTim picks at a piece of fuzz on his blanket. \u201cI still don\u2019t get it,\u201d he murmurs, because he doesn\u2019t. No matter how many people have explained it to him, he still doesn\u2019t understand. \u201cThe caseworker said they finally got a hold of my parents. They\u2019re getting the next flight back. So why are you still\u2026\u201d\u00a0\nHe trails off, eyes prickling.\n\u201c...Filing for emergency custody of you?\u201d Bruce finishes for him.\u00a0\nTim nods.\n\u201cBecause your parents are under investigation for criminal levels of child neglect\u2014specifically, child abandonment.\u201d Bruce\u2019s tone is factual, but not at all unkind. \u201cThe state is removing you from their custody until a full investigation can take place.\u201d\nTim knows that already. He\u2019s been hearing those words from doctors, nurses, and social service workers ever since he woke up, but he still can\u2019t quite wrap his head around them.\u00a0\n\u201cBut they didn\u2019t abandon me,\u201d he argues weakly. \u201cThey just went on a trip, like they always do. They left me a note. They\u2019ll be back.\u201d\nThey always come back.\n\u201cTim, sweetheart\u2026\u201d Bruce sighs deeply. \u201cThey left you home alone with an infected stab wound for over four days without so much as a phone call to check in. You were in septic shock when Jason found you. You very nearly died.\u201d\n\u201cBut that\u2019s my fault,\u201d Tim says, his eyes filling with tears. \u201cThey didn\u2019t even know I was hurt. I never told them. So it\u2019s my fault, not theirs.\u201d\nBruce shakes his head firmly. \u201cNone of this is your fault.\u201d\n\u201cBut it is!\u201d Tim protests, a little frantically. \u201cI\u2019m the idiot who went out and got hurt, and I\u2019m the one who didn\u2019t tell anyone. So why are they the ones getting in trouble now? They didn\u2019t hurt me\u2014they didn\u2019t do anything!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the problem, bud.\u201d Bruce looks physically pained. \u201cThey didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d\n \u201cOf course they didn\u2019t!\u201d  Tim blurts in frustration. \u201cWhy w-would they? They\u2019ve never\u2013\u201d\u00a0\nTim\u2019s choking out sobs now, tears streaming down his cheeks. Bruce plucks a few tissues from the box on the side table and moves from his chair to perch on the edge of Tim\u2019s bed.\n\u201cThey never do  anything,\u201d  Tim cries. \u201cThey never\u2026 they never\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Bruce reassures softly, his hand hovering over Tim\u2019s like he\u2019s not quite sure if it will hurt him to take it. Tim doesn\u2019t care\u2014he latches on like a lifeline.\u00a0\n\u201cThey were home,\u201d Tim whines, unable to stop the words now that they\u2019ve started coming. \u201cThey were home and they still\u2026 They still didn\u2019t\u2013\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Bruce repeats, just as soft. \u201cAnd I\u2019m so sorry, Tim. They should\u2019ve noticed. They should have cared.\u201d\n\u201cI  tried,\u201d  he sobs. \u201cI tried  so hard. I didn\u2019t\u2013 didn\u2019t bother them and I didn\u2019t embarrass them and I followed all the rules and they still\u2026 they still\u2013\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Bruce says for a third time, barely a whisper. He\u2019s squeezing Tim\u2019s hand nearly as hard as Tim\u2019s squeezing his. \u201cYou\u2019re a good kid, Tim. You deserve so much more.\u201d\nThey sit like that for a long while, Tim\u2019s sobs eventually fading into quiet hiccups while Bruce holds on tightly, the pad of his thumb stroking over Tim\u2019s wrist. By the time Tim\u2019s all cried out, his eyes aren\u2019t the only misty ones in the room.\u00a0\nFinally, Bruce clears his throat. \u201cI\u2019m going to go see about getting you more painkillers now,\u201d he whispers.\nTim feels the loss of contact as his hand is released, and it takes every ounce of self control not to whine like a baby. He closes his eyes and leans back against the pillows.\nSensing Tim\u2019s reluctance, Bruce hesitates for another moment. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay, sweetheart. We\u2019re going to get you through this. You don\u2019t have to do it all on your own anymore.\u201d\nThe words ache in Tim\u2019s chest.\u00a0\n\u201c\u2026Promise?\u201d he whispers.\n\u201cI promise,\u201d Bruce says, so firmly that Tim almost starts to believe him.\nTim ends up spending four more days in the hospital.\nIt\u2019s not as boring as he\u2019d expected it to be. As soon as the emergency foster placement paperwork goes through and Tim is officially placed in the Waynes\u2019 custody, his hospital room turns into a revolving door of visitors. Alfred filters in and out, popping between the hospital and the Manor to get things ready for him, while the boys bring in armloads of books, video games, and movies.\nEven Mrs. Mac stops by:\n\u201c\u2013And that was the last time I ever let my Matthew do a mud run,\u201d she concludes her frankly horrifying story of her family\u2019s personal experience with septicemia way back in \u201896. \u201cOr at least not until that toe stump of his healed\u2014what a nightmare! And the entire time that boy was laid up, who do you suppose was taking care of those blasted hamsters? Because it wasn\u2019t my Mattie, I\u2019ll tell you that much\u2026\u201d\u00a0\n(Bruce ends up politely cutting her off after an hour or so, claiming that Tim needs his rest. Tim could\u2019ve honestly kissed him.)\nFinally, the doctors decide that Tim\u2019s ready to be discharged.\u00a0\n\u201cI still think we should\u2019ve taken him home like two days ago,\u201d Jason grumbles as they all make their way up the Manor\u2019s front steps.\n\u201cHe was still on the IV drugs then,\u201d Dick points out.\nJason snorts as Alfred opens the front door to greet them. \u201cYou say this like our basement isn\u2019t full of them\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBoys,\u201d Bruce grunts, helping Tim over the threshold. \u201cYou know the rules. Wait until we\u2019re inside to discuss our\u2026 extracurriculars.\u201d\nJason rolls his eyes. \u201cOh yeah, \u2018cus there\u2019s just hordes of people on our private property listening in,\u201d he huffs as he follows Tim in.\n\u201cYeah, besides, Jason already blew our cover,\u201d Dick quips. He turns to Tim, grinning. \u201cIt was his football game excuse, wasn\u2019t it? I told him it was stupid.\u201d\nJason scowls. \u201cNo, it was the stitches you popped on his birthday.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI think you mean  you  popped.\u201d\nTim can feel his cheeks flush\u2014and not from the lingering fever. \u201cUm\u2026 neither. I actually figured it out when I was nine.\u201d\n\u201cWait,  nine?\u201d  Dick balks at him.\u00a0\nTim winces as Alfred helps him out of his coat. \u201cI saw Robin do a quadruple somersault on the news. Connected it to the Flying Graysons.\u201d\n\u201cHa!\u201d Jason whirls around, face triumphant. \u201cSo it  was  you! Pay up, Dickface,\u201d he demands, hand outstretched.\nRecovering from his shock, Dick sighs and pulls out his wallet. He slaps a fifty dollar bill in Jason\u2019s open palm. \u201cStill think your football game excuse was flimsy as hell\u2026\u201d he grumbles.\nBruce fixes his children with a very unamused look. \u201cDid you two seriously bet on who blew our cover.\u201d\nAlfred clears his throat. \u201cI must admit, I had a hundred on it being you, sir.\u201d\nAs the rest of the Waynes all dissolve into bickering, Tim can\u2019t help but smile a little.\nIt\u2019s good to finally be home."
