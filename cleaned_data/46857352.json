    "text": "\nThe class learned pretty quickly after moving into the dorms that Katsuki's sleep schedule was \n\nvery\n\n important to him.\n\n\nEvery evening without fail, at 9pm, he was locked away in his room, unreachable until 5am the next day, which was the ungodly time that the blond decided to go on his morning run before class.\n\n\nHe did not allow this schedule to be disrupted, no matter what. He didn't participate in movie nights, late night gaming sessions, and even when he was partaking in group \n\nstudying\n\n sessions, he would pack up his stuff and leave when it was starting to get dark.\n\n\nThe others learned that if they needed Katsuki to tutor them in something, they had to get that shit scheduled in \n\nearly.\n\n\n\nBut as much as they pretended to tease Katsuki for having a 'bedtime', the class accepted these little traits fairly quickly, deeming them as just another part of Bakugou Katsuki that they would have to get used to.\n\n\nThey'd never seen him mess up his schedule before, not until now.\n\n\nKatsuki had been... oddly quiet today. He was still grumpy, still as stubborn and unapproachable as always, but there was definitely something different about his attitude. They knew something was up when after being reminded that they had Heroics training next, instead of going to change into his costume like usual, he instead turned and smacked his head against the wall. And then again, and again, and again, and-\n\n\nKaminari grabbed his shoulder to stop him before he could give himself a concussion.\n\n\n\"Holy shit, Bakugou what's gotten into you? You've been like this all \n\nday!\"\n\n He asked, eyes wide in confusion as he looked around at the rest of the group for help.\n\n\n\"Seriously man,\" Kirishima nodded, a single eyebrow raised. \"What's up with you?\"\n\n\nKatsuki lifted his head to glare at them balefully, his eyes hard and tired. He maintained eye contact for a few seconds before huffing and turning away, stomping towards the changing rooms without a single word.\n\n\nThey stared after him.\n\n\n\"Well that was...\" Ashido considered, \"Not in any way helpful.\"\n\n\n\"He's barely said a word all day, do you think he's upset?\" Sero theorised. Kirishima shook his head.\n\n\n\"When he's upset he usually just gets more angry, it's probably just a bad day. C'mon, or we'll be late.\"\n\n\nWhen they got to the changing rooms, the boys splitting off from Ashido and traipsing into the boys area, Katsuki was already almost done, sitting on a bench and staring forward blankly while one of his hands blindly fiddled with a strap on his wrist grenades. Izuku was nearby, also already in costume, and he watched Katsuki with a confused sort of amusement.\n\n\n\"Shut the fuck up.\" Katsuki snapped without even moving his head.\n\n\n\"I-I didn't say anything!\" Izuku tried to defend. When Katsuki finally finished with his grenades and slowly, \n\npainfully slowly,\n\n stood up from the bench, Izuku's mouth twitched upwards ever so slightly. The others in the room watched curiously.\n\n\n\"Did you sleep at all last night?\"\n\n\nKatsuki glared at him ferociously, and everybody watching prepared for the unavoidable attack, verbal or physical, that was surely about to be thrown in Izuku's direction, as had happened so many times in the past.\n\n\nInstead, to their bafflement, Katsuki turned and leant his forehead against a nearby locker, whining, actually \n\nwhining\n\n as he did so.\n\n\n\"M' too fucking \n\ntired\n\n to do this shit today,\" He moaned, while everybody stared, unsure of how to react.\n\n\nIzuku giggled slightly. \"What were you even \n\ndoing\n\n last night?\" He asked, apparently not even remotely bothered by the sudden switch up in Katsuki's character. Said tired blond just shrugged into the wall.\n\n\n\"That fucker. Th' one from middle school.\"\n\n\nIzuku blinked at him. \"That could mean so many people, Kacchan.\"\n\n\nTo clarify, Katsuki turned slightly and motioned to his own hair, waving it around while making an odd grumbling noise. \"That fucker.\"\n\n\nIzuku looked at him, before his eyes widened and he gasped lightly, because apparently that was enough of an explanation. \"Oh, ginger hair guy. Chota?\"\n\n\nKatsuki hummed, closing his eyes.\n\n\n\n'What the fuck?'\n\n Kaminari mouthed, staring at Todoroki, who happened to be opposite him and within eye-line. He shrugged back, clueless.\n\n\n\"Asshole made me help him study for his med school exam. All \n\nfucking\n\n night.\" Katsuki muttered. Sero winced sympathetically. All night study sessions were brutal; for somebody like Katsuki who usually went to bed at nine? It must have been torture.\n\n\nIzuku giggled slightly, his curls bouncing. \"So you're gonna be half dead for the rest of the day then?\"\n\n\nKatsuki whined into the wall again.\n\n\nEverybody else in the room was fucking baffled.\n\n\nThey stared after the two as Izuku skipped out of the changing room, Katsuki following much more begrudgingly.\n\n\n\"So that was fucking weird, right?\" Kirishima checked, pointing at the door they'd just left through. The other occupants of the room nodded in agreement.\n\n\n\"I don't think I've ever seen those two have a conversation that didn't end in Midoriya's physical health taking a hit before.\" Todoroki muttered, head tilting to the side.\n\n\n\"It is very odd,\" Tokoyami agreed. \"Could that simply be what happens when Bakugou neglects his sleep schedule?\"\n\n\nKaminari shook his head. \"I don't think so, we've been with him all day. He's mostly been normal, apart from just ignoring the shit out of us. I think Mido's the first person he actually \n\nresponded\n\n to.\"\n\n\n\"This is \n\nso\n\n weird,\" Kirishima reiterated.\n\n\n\"It's interesting to see, at the very least.\" Tokoyami shrugged, before leaving the changing room. Eventually, they all followed.\n\n\nThe training exercise planned for them that day turned out to be one designed to help them improve their strategic and team planning abilities, and the class was split up into multiple groups of five.\n\n\nTokoyami, Kirishima, and Uraraka silently cast tired glances at each other when they were placed in the same team as both Katsuki and Izuku. Those two on the same team \n\nnever\n\n worked out well. They may be powerful, but when Katsuki was needed to work together with Izuku they ended up being more of a \n\nhandicap\n\n than an advantage.\n\n\nStill, they couldn't switch teams, so the five were sent into the training zone with ten minutes until the match was to start.\u00a0\n\n\nThe game was supposed to be based on capture the flag, with two teams being sent in at a time to strategize and then battle it out. They had to use teamwork and cunning to evade other team members while both keeping their teams flag safe, and trying to steal the other teams.\u00a0\n\n\n\"Alright, so we're up against Sero, Momo, Todo, Kaminari, and Mineta.\" Uraraka prompted, eager to use the time they had to get a good strategy going. Kirishima, who had spent enough time with Katsuki to immediately turn to him as the leader of the group, narrowed his eyes in confusion when the blond didn't immediately take over the planning session, rushing in with his 'superior' ideas like he usually would have. Instead, he stood there, blinking slowly, arms limp as he stood there like he was a puppet hanging from nothing but a few strings.\u00a0\n\n\n\"Geez, you really are exhausted, huh?\" He muttered under his breath. It said a lot that Katsuki didn't even give a sign that he'd heard the comment, instead continuing to stare at the ground.\u00a0\n\n\n\"Momo's smart, she'll have a good plan.\" Tokoyami commented, face calculating. \"If we want a chance of evading our flags capture we will have to predict what she is most likely to plan and act accordingly.\"\n\n\n\"If she's leading their team then she's most likely to split them into two groups. She'll probably put three people defending their flag and send two to try and capture ours. Probably Todoroki and Mineta.\" Izuku pointed out, and Uraraka nodded.\n\n\n\"She'd put Mineta as far away from herself as she can. That's what I'd do.\"\n\n\nKirishima watched as Katsuki's head dropped slightly before jerking upwards again, and he took the risk of gently nudging him in the side. \"Hey, Bakubro, you got any ideas?\"\u00a0\n\n\nKatsuki rubbed his eyes with his hand, glaring at Kirishima before squinting at the ground slightly.\n\n\n\"Who gives a shit, s' not like they can beat us.\"\n\n\n\"You could at least \n\ntry\n\n to work as a team,\" Uraraka huffed when Katsuki responded with nothing but a lazily thrown up middle finger in her direction. \"You're always bragging about how you could take all of us in a fight if you wanted; so prove it.\"\n\n\nKatsuki sighed, tilting his head to glare up at the sky before dropping it down and stretching out his arms.\u00a0\n\n\n\"Alright, Deku get your ass over here. And you're wrong about Ponytail.\"\n\n\nThey were a little confused as to what Katsuki could possibly need him for, but nobody said anything as Izuku innocently walked over to where Katsuki was and stood in front of him.\n\n\n\"What do you need, Kacchan?\"\u00a0\n\n\nIn response, Katsuki didn't say anything. Instead, he reached out and spun the boy around so he was facing outwards, before abruptly wrapping his hands around him from behind and dropping his chin onto Izuku's shoulder, leaning into his head.\n\n\n\"Nothin, just wanted t' hug you.\" Katsuki mumbled, slightly muffled by the younger boy's neck. Izuku did not seem in any way put out or confused by these turns of events, as every-fucking-body else was. He relaxed into Katsuki's hold almost instinctually, just rolling his eyes fondly as his hands reached up to naturally hang off of where Katsuki\u2019s arms were wrapped around his collarbone, not saying anything.\u00a0\n\n\n\"Ponytail will keep the Grape fucker behind and send herself and Icyhot out to get our flag.\" Katsuki continued, not letting go of Izuku and not batting an eye to the incredulous stares he was getting. \"All you gotta do to weaken their defence is get Tape-face away from the other two. If Dunce-face is left alone with the Grape fucker for more than three minutes, he'll get pissed off enough that he'll electrocute him. That's one down, and the other two are easy. You dipshits protect the flag and I'll handle the rest and get theirs.\"\n\n\nEverybody stared at him. They did not stop.\n\n\n\"Listen man, I'm not gonna lie, I didn't hear a single word you just said.\" Kirishima said, eyes not straying from the public affection that \n\nBakugou Katsuki\n\n was giving \n\nMidoriya Izuku.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhat the ever-loving \n\nfuck.\n\n\n\n\"What the ever-loving \n\nfuck.\"\n\n Uraraka muttered quietly, because all three of them had the exact same thought process. Tokoyami nodded in agreement.\u00a0\n\n\n\"What?\" Katsuki snapped, his face still half meshed into Izuku's shoulder. \"You wanted a fucking plan, I gave you one.\"\n\n\nKirishima gestured to him and Izuku, hoping his face conveyed just how confused he was. \n\n\"What?\"\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"What.\" Katsuki growled back.\n\n\nKirishima turned away, looking to Tokoyami and Uraraka for possible backup.\u00a0\n\n\nHe didn't get any.\n\n\n\"We're gonna lose this exercise.\" Tokoyami declared.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nKatsuki's predictions were... annoyingly accurate. Once the alarm went off to signal to the two teams that the match was starting, He slid off from where he was practically laying across Izuku's back, cracking his neck and sauntering off towards the other teams home base as if he hadn't just shook the entire world of everyone around him.\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku, who still had not given any indication that he thought Katsuki's actions were in any way odd, stayed to protect their team's flag, along with Uraraka and Tokoyami. Kirishima ended up following Katsuki against his wishes, just to ensure that Aizawa couldn't dock their points for 'not acting as a team' and having him go off on his own.\u00a0\n\n\nThey found Sero, Kaminari and Mineta waiting to defend their flag, and Kirishima didn't know if it was infuriating or downright hysterical that Katsuki's plan played out perfectly. He gunned straight for Sero, blasting him away and refusing to allow him near the rest of his teammates. Kirishima got to watch from a nearby rooftop as Kaminari and Mineta, now without somebody between them and unable to leave the flag without abandoning any chances of winning, quickly delved into relentless bickering.\u00a0\n\n\nBy minute four alone, Mineta was frazzled and unconscious, still twitching, and Kaminari was the only block between Kirishima's team and winning.\u00a0\n\n\nKirishima jumped down into his friend's eyeline, and Kaminari prepared to fight him.\u00a0\n\n\n\"Dude,\" Kirishima said, walking over to him with his hands in the air, not attempting to fight despite their being on opposite teams. \"You're never gonna guess what.\"\n\n\n\"What?\"\u00a0\n\n\n\"Bakugou just hugged Midoriya. Like, in front of us. Willingly.\"\n\n\nKaminari stared at him.\u00a0\n\n\nHe dropped his defensive stance. They heard the sound of Sero getting smashed through the side of a building a few streets away.\n\n\n\"You're \n\nfucking\n\n lying.\" Kaminari said, gobsmacked and immediately forgetting about the fight. Kirishima nodded, before reaching out to grab the other team's flag pole.\u00a0\n\n\n\"Also, you lose.\"\n\n\nAnother siren sounded, signalling that the match was over.\n\n\n\"No no, hold on, Bakugou \n\nhugged\n\n somebody? And it was \n\nMidoriya?\"\n\n This new information apparently took priority, as Kaminari didn't seem to care about his loss at \n\nall.\n\n\n\nKirishima understood, and he was glad that he was surrounded by people who understood the importance of what he'd witnessed.\u00a0\n\n\n\"Mido wasn't even surprised either, he just stood there and let it happen like it was normal.\"\n\n\nIn the distance, there was an explosion and a yell, and then Aizawa's voice was appearing over the speakers warning Bakugou that the match was over, and if he didn't leave Sero alone he would get detention.\u00a0\n\n\n\"What the ever-loving \n\nfuck.\"\n\n\n\nKirishima hummed. \"Yeah, that's what we said.\"\n\n\n\"Like- like arms? A \n\nhug\n\n hug? Purposely? Midoriya didn't just run into him?\"\n\n\n\"It was more casual, like a hug from behind.\"\n\n\n\"Well maybe he was secretly holding him at gunpoint or something then?\"\n\n\n\"No; he called Midoriya over, hugged him, then said he wanted a hug.\"\n\n\n\"What the\n\n fuck.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\nKaminari stared at him, processing.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cNo, seriously, what the \n\nfuck?\u201d\n\n\n\nKirishima nodded once more. \u201cNo, yeah, I\u2019m in the same boat as you, man.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI thought he couldn\u2019t stand Midoriya?\u201d\n\n\nKirishima reached out to place both his hands on the other boy's shoulders, staring deep into his eyes solemnly.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cSo did I, Denki. So the fuck did I.\u201d\n\n\nUraraka loved UA, she really did. She was friends with almost everybody in her class, got to be taught by some of her idols almost every day, and was able to live out her childhood dream of becoming a Hero!\n\n\nShe could do without the school assemblies, though.\n\n\nMaybe it was a little childish to be so against them, but Uraraka had thought her days of sitting in a large hall filled with students while their teachers and principle talked about the most \n\nboring\n\n things imaginable for hours on end; well, she'd thought she'd left those days behind in middle school, is all.\u00a0\n\n\nBut no, apparently even UA had mandatory assemblies every now and then.\n\n\nIt was just like she remembered back when she was a kid; all the students shepherded into a massive auditorium and told to get comfy because Nedzu would be talking to them about \n\nsafety\n\n for the next few hours.\n\n\nIt was fair to say at least half the hall mentally checked out the second they heard what the assembly was about. Ok, yes, maybe they got attacked a lot, and got into their fair share of trouble, and \n\nyes\n\n maybe this year had seen a new height for serious injuries coming from the new heroics students, but that didn't mean they should be subjected to this sort of torture, \n\nright?\n\n\n\nUraraka shared a tired look with Todoroki as the two of them, along with Iida and Asui, found a place to sit down, the four of them having entered the hall together.\u00a0\n\n\n\"We should save a place for Mido to sit, he'll probably come and join us when he comes in,\" Asui whispered as the bustle of the other students started to mellow out a bit, everybody starting to settle down as they waited for the assembly to start.\u00a0\n\n\nIida craned his neck towards the entrance before perking up slightly, pointing. \"There he is; somebody get his attention.\"\n\n\nAs the last on their row, Uraraka took it as her job to flag him down, turning to locate him and waving to get his attention. Izuku was standing at the entrance, looking over the sea of people with a slightly nervous face as he clearly scanned every visible person for somebody he knew.\n\n\nUraraka stuck her hand up higher when he didn't notice her, opening her mouth to call his name, but she faltered when she noticed him sag slightly in relief, and immediately hurry over to somebody on the other side of the large hall.\u00a0\n\n\n\"He's going over there, who's he-?\" She paused in confusion as she finally caught on to who Izuku was making his way towards.\u00a0\n\n\nAsui furrowed her eyebrows. \"Who's he going to?\"\n\n\n\"He's going to sit with Bakugou?\" Todoroki realised, eyes following Uraraka's, and the four watched as Izuku fast-walked over to the row that did indeed have Katsuki sitting on its end, with Kirishima, Kaminari, and Sero next to him.\u00a0\n\n\n\"He tried to sit next to Bakugou on the couch the other night and got \n\nshoved off,\n\n doesn't he have a better chance trying to sit on the stage next to Aizawa-sensei?\" Asui muttered, gesturing towards the stage where Aizawa, along with multiple other teachers, were sitting on chairs and looking very much like they wanted to be there just as little as the students did. Uraraka shrugged.\n\n\nAcross the room, Izuku finally came up to where Katsuki was sitting, fingering the end of his shirt as he silently stood there, not saying anything. Katsuki noticed the presence and looked up, before rolling his eyes and -to their audience's surprise- silently slid further into the row to give Izuku room to sit down.\u00a0\n\n\nHe sat down quickly, looking much less tense, and neither of them seemed to notice the way Katsuki's own friends watched this happen with the exact same level of understanding as Uraraka did. They watched Kirishima lean forward to see Izuku before turning quizzical eyes onto Kaminari, who raised an eyebrow in turn.\n\n\n\"That's... not very in-character for Bakugou,\" Asui observed evenly.\u00a0\n\n\n\"It is odd,\" Iida admitted. \"But maybe he's just starting to recognise the importance of class unity?\"\u00a0\n\n\nAsui and Uraraka shared disbelieving looks. \"Yeah, \n\nsure\n\n Iida.\"\n\n\nThey were disrupted by Nedzu's voice echoing through the giant room, and their attention was momentarily ripped away from the strange interaction as the assembly finally started.\u00a0\n\n\nStill, Uraraka couldn't help but be drawn back to her friend repeatedly throughout the assembly, boredom and curiosity leading her eyes back over to where she knew her classmates were sat, as did the others around her. About fifteen minutes into Nedzu's spiel Asui snorted quietly, jerking her head over to where she'd been watching Izuku and Katsuki.\u00a0\n\n\n\"Kero, looks like Mido's even more bored than us. Maybe he \n\nshould\n\n have sat with us,\" She giggled. Uraraka turned her gaze over to where Katsuki was clearly trying very hard to pay attention to the assembly, while Izuku fidgeted restlessly next to him.\n\n\nHe was tapping his hand on his knee repeatedly, head whipping around the walls and ceiling as he tried to find something interesting to focus on, almost seeming to physically \n\nwill\n\n the talk to go by faster. It reminded Uraraka somewhat of a small child waiting desperately to be allowed to go play in a playground, or a dog wagging its tail as it waited for its owner's permission to dive into the food bowl in front of it.\u00a0\n\n\nHe started picking at the skin around his nails, eyes flittering around as he brought his hand up to his mouth to nibble on them, when Uraraka saw Katsuki side-eye him with a tired glance.\u00a0\n\n\nDistantly, dozens of memories floated to Uraraka's mind, in which both Izuku and other classmates had been the victim of that look only moments before a smack to the head or a verbal assault.\u00a0\n\n\nInstead, both her and Asui watched as Katsuki silently reached up to drag Izuku's nails away from his mouth, seeming to whisper something to him as he did so. Izuku wilted, looking put out as he whispered something back in response. Then, Katsuki rolled his eyes in- that couldn't be right, but Uraraka swore she saw \n\nfondness\n\n in those eyes, as Katsuki reached into his back pocket and brought out a thick, red marker. He handed it to Izuku, making a gesture with his arm as he turned back to focus on the stage.\u00a0\n\n\nUraraka's first thought was \n\n'why did that just happen?'\u00a0\n\n\n\nHer second, was \n\n'isn't the pen useless without something to use it on?'\u00a0\n\n\n\nThis second thought turned, rapidly, into her third; \n\n'Oh my god, Midoriya is trying to suicide-by-cop himself with Bakugou.'\n\n\n\nThis was because, upon being handed this marker and having been left to his own devices, Izuku\u00a0 immediately brightened up, uncapped the pen, and promptly dragged Katsuki's arm into his lap, where he began to carefully draw on his \n\nskin.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Is he allowed to do that?\" Todoroki whispered next to Uraraka, alerting her to the fact that all four of their little group were now watching with fascination as Izuku actually looked like he was... getting away with drawing on Katsuki's arm. \n\nWithout consequences.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0The assembly faded into the background as Uraraka blinked to check that what she was seeing was real, but nothing changed when she looked back at the two classmates that she had previously believed couldn't even go three minutes without getting into a fight.\n\n\nNot that that was anything to do with Izuku; it was just that Katsuki had never before acted like he thought Izuku was even worthy to be called a \n\nperson.\n\n Yet here he was, silently and calmly allowing the other boy to use his bare skin as a canvas, just to... what? To keep him from getting bored during a school assembly? To stop him fidgeting? To curb his fingernail biting habits? Uraraka had no fucking clue.\n\n\nStill, the four watched as Izuku kept going throughout the entirety of the assembly; Katsuki's arm slowly getting submerged in a red sea of carefully traced lines and shapes, patterns and flowers blooming all along and up his arm like a tattoo sleeve. Even from the distance they were at, Uraraka could see the artistic detail in Izuku's drawings, as Katsuki patiently allowed himself to be used as a drawing pad.\n\n\nEventually, Kirishima noticed what Izuku was doing to his friend, and Uraraka could see the red head's face go from confused to incredulous as he watched his usually explosive and touch-avoidant friend be so calm. He silently slapped Kaminari in the chest with the back of his hand, face not straying from where Izuku was actually \n\npushing Katsuki's sleeve out of the way\n\n so he could access more skin; and Katsuki \n\nlet\n\n him, even going so far as to use his free arm to roll the edges of the short sleeve up and onto his shoulder to allow the younger boy more access, his eyes and attention never once leaving the stage in front.\n\n\nThey saw Kaminari turn to where Kirishima was directing him, and his eyes widened. It seemed that not a single person who was aware of what was going on wasn't in some sort of state of befuddlement. If Katsuki or Izuku noticed the reactions of the people around them, neither of them showed it.\u00a0\n\n\nAfter a while they had to tune back into what their teachers were saying on stage, but they kept returning to the pair on the other end of the room, unable to stop themselves from checking if what they'd previously seen wasn't in fact a mass hallucination that the four of them had shared. Even after the assembly finally ended, and the massive room full of students all tried to leave at once so they could get back to class, and Katsuki and Izuku were lost in the sea of heads, they still wondered what had gone on.\u00a0\n\n\n\"Do you think Bakugou and Midoriya are 'enemies to lovers'?\" Todoroki brought up when they were walking down the packed corridor to their classroom. Uraraka almost fell flat on her face, and the others stared at him as if he were mad, which Uraraka honestly thought he might be.\u00a0\n\n\n\"What the \n\nfuck\n\n are you talking about?\" She choked out between disbelieving laughter.\u00a0\n\n\nTodoroki shrugged. \"I've seen people use it online to describe fictional characters that used to hate each other but then turn romantic, and I wondered if that could be what is going on with Bakugou and Midoriya. Maybe the hatred was more on Bakugou's side than Midoriya's, but they were definitely 'enemies'. Or at least 'rivals', so maybe 'rivals to lovers' is a more accurate term.\" He added thoughtfully.\u00a0\n\n\n\"I don't think we should be talking about our classmates' personal lives behind their backs,\" Iida immediately said, chopping his arms. \"It is incredibly disrespectful!\"\u00a0\n\n\n\"No, I want to talk about it,\" Asui said. \"Because Todo just implied that he thought Bakugou and Midoriya were \n\ndating.\"\n\n\n\n\"I don't see how that is a reach, considering their actions just now.\" Todoroki shrugged. Asui laughed again, while Uraraka's eyes widened because \n\nholy shit.\n\n\n\n\"Hold on, Todo might be onto something,\" She said, mouth curling up in slight disbelief that she was even taking a second to credit this ridiculous theory.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Seriously?!\"\n\n Asui exclaimed, looking slightly disappointed in Uraraka for even daring to think such things.\u00a0\n\n\n\"You have to admit that was weirdly intimate,\" She tried to defend, Todoroki nodding along next to her as they finally reached the empty classroom, all taking their seats but facing each other to continue their little debate. \"Bakugou hates when people even go near him, let alone touch him, \n\nlet alone\n\n leave physical marks on his body that won't immediately disappear; yet we just watched Midoriya spend the good part of five hours \n\ndrawing\n\n the entire right side of his body! And he just let it happen! He even \n\nsupplied the pen! \n\nFirst Midoriya's actually looking \n\nrelieved\n\n to see him in a crowd, choosing to sit by him, and then this? Come on.\"\n\n\n\"Well, maybe he just-,\" Asui cut herself off, desperately trying to think of some other explanation. \"Maybe they're just starting to become really good friends?\"\n\n\nEven Iida couldn't hold back his disbelieving snort.\n\n\n\"Has there been literally \n\nany\n\n instance between those two before today that could lead you to believe that Bakugou and Midoriya could spend five minutes in a room together without getting into a physical fight?\" Uraraka asked.\u00a0\n\n\n\"Kero, have \n\nyou\n\n seen anything else that could lead you to think that they're \n\ndating?\" \n\nAsui pointed out, which, point.\u00a0\n\n\n\"Well- I-,\" Uraraka faltered, before perking right up again. \"Yes! The hug! The hug we told you about after that capture the flag thing a few weeks ago!\"\n\n\nAsui narrowed her eyes, confused. \"The hug? That was real? I thought you and Kiri were just fucking with us,\" She remarked.\u00a0\n\n\n\"No, It was real. Bakugou got sleep deprived and in his sleep deprived state he immediately went to seek physical comfort from none other than \n\nIzuku Midoriya.\"\n\n Uraraka pointed a finger down on her desk, starting to get into things. \n\n\"That \n\nis \n\nnot\n\n a 'I used to hate this guy and now we're starting to become friends' thing, \n\nthat\n\n is a 'I consider this person to be somebody I love and feel safe with, and I want to be near them' thing.\"\n\n\nTodoroki nodded his head frantically. \"Rivals to lovers.\"\u00a0\n\n\nAsui rolled her eyes. \"So why do they still act like they did when we first started at UA? If they're really \n\nsoulmates-\"\n\n She clasped her hands dramatically while rolling her eyes, clearly not buying it, \"Like you two seem to think, then why have there only been two incidents where they've acted even remotely friendly with each other?\"\n\n\nUraraka paused, and Todoroki jumped in.\u00a0\n\n\n\"Maybe they're trying to hide it.\" He proposed. Uraraka snapped her fingers, pointing over to him and nodding.\u00a0\n\n\n\"Exactly! Maybe they don't want anybody to know yet because it's so new, so they're just acting like that in public!\"\n\n\n\"But if it's true love, then their real feelings are bound to slip sometimes,\" Todoroki finished, looking very satisfied.\u00a0\n\n\nIida and Asui looked at each other, before looking back at them.\u00a0\n\n\n\"For the record, I still think this conversation shouldn't have happened.\" Iida declared. \"But!\" Uraraka grinned. \"If there is any merit to what you two propose, then out of respect for our classmates we have to keep it to ourselves. If they are hiding... \n\nromantic feelings,\"\n\n Asui snorted at the way Iida choked out the words, as if the notion of romance was something that didn't even compute with his head. \"-then we must trust that they have reasons and allow them their privacy.\"\n\n\n\"I still think it's bullshit, but fair enough.\"\u00a0 Asui said, as some of their other classmates finally trickled into the room.\u00a0\n\n\n\"What's bullshit?\" Koda said, as he and a few others took their seats.\u00a0\n\n\n\"That assembly,\" Uraraka said easily, effectively ending the conversation as their classmates mindlessly agreed and sat in their seats.\n\n\n\"Language, however it could have been condensed into a leaflet or five minute bullet point list, I have to say.\" Aizawa said, to their surprise, as he walked in, already looking like he was done for the week. He immediately got into his sleeping bag, somehow managing to curl up in the chair behind his desk while having the bag zipped up.\n\n\nSome of the last ones to enter were Sero and Kirishima, who walked in side by side and looked at the class.\u00a0\n\n\n\"Hey guys?\" Kirishima said. \"How long does it take for sharpie to come off if it gets on skin?\"\n\n\n\"Um,\" Jiro was the one to respond, obviously not having the context that Uraraka did. \"Like, three days I think? Why?\"\n\n\nKirishima nodded his head, taking a seat without bothering to explain. Then, what Uraraka had been waiting for; Katsuki entered the classroom.\u00a0\n\n\nHe was much closer now than he had been in the auditorium, and Uraraka could see just how detailed and neat Izuku's designs had been. She hadn't, however, quite realised just the extent of how much he'd managed to draw during the time the assembly had taken place.\n\n\nKatsuki's right arm was completely covered. He was only wearing a short sleeve shirt, so they could all see the obvious red ink that looked like it had exploded onto his skin, stretching up and wrapping around from the palm of his hand until it disappeared under the fabric of his uniform at the shoulder. It was somehow both messy and organised, with a spiral that soared outwards into vines, and flowers that extended into all directions. Shapes and patterns filled every gap, with tiny dots to accentuate the lines and curves that painted his skin. It reminded Uraraka a little of the photos of Indian wedding henna that she'd seen online, except instead of just the hands and wrist it was almost the entire right side of his body.\u00a0\n\n\nIt was obvious that Izuku had moved Katsuki's uniform to get more drawing space, the patterns continuing as they peeked over the top of his collar and creeping up his neck. There was a small red vine that snaked up the side of his head and disappeared into his hair, with daisies and leaves dotting the side of his face, a particularly brave drawing of a slender, leafy tree blossoming on his neck, it's branches daring to reach its foliage along the border of the right side of his face.\n\n\nKatsuki entered the room as if he wasn't a living artwork, determinedly not taking in any of the class's shock at his appearance whatsoever. Kaminari entered just after him, just staring at the blond as he had since he'd first taken notice of Izuku's little project. Said artist entered just after Kaminari, an innocent red sharpie held limply in one hand.\u00a0\n\n\nNobody said anything. Even Aizawa was staring, looking like he was wondering if he'd accidentally entered a parallel universe.\u00a0\n\n\nKatsuki took his seat without a word, ignoring the eyes following him.\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku shuffled over.\u00a0\n\n\n\"I'm not gonna be able to stop thinking about it if I don't finish it,\" He muttered pleadingly. Katsuki tsked, rolling his eyes.\u00a0\n\n\n\"Fucking hurry up then, nerd.\"\n\n\nQuick as lightning, Izuku uncapped the pen, using his hand to push Katsuki's head up and exposing his neck. Uraraka saw multiple jaws drop as Katsuki allowed the action without even a single complaint. Izuku didn't seem to notice the reactions around him, just adding a few more dots and lines to a slightly bare place on the right side of Katsuki's neck before nodding in satisfaction and stepping back.\u00a0\n\n\n\"Thanks Kacchan,\" He said, pleased. Katsuki didn't answer, just stretching his neck out, and Izuku sat down at his desk as if nothing had happened.\u00a0\n\n\nThe room was silent.\n\n\nAizawa stared at Katsuki. He opened his mouth, as if thinking about making a comment or asking a question, before evidentially deciding against it, and he turned his head away to look at the entire class instead of just those two.\u00a0\n\n\nWithout anything else to do, Aizawa started the class. He didn't blame his students for taking a while before they actually started paying attention. \n\n\nIt had been Jiro's idea; they all wanted to make that clear.\n\n\nA bunch of the class had a free evening at the dorms so they thought, hey, why not have a movie night all together? It was harmless! Jiro picked out a movie that had come out a year or so ago that none of them had seen yet, Uraraka and Iida collected snacks for everybody, and Kaminari joined forces with Momo to collect every blanket or pillow that they knew existed inside the dorm building, temporarily relocating them to the common room to create a single, gigantic couch that spanned across the entirety of the floor in front of the TV. When they were all done, Uraraka, Iida, Jiro, Kaminari, Izuku, Momo, Asui, Hakagura, and Ashido all reconvened to watch the movie.\n\n\nIt had been going great, the chosen movie full of action and fighting and just the \n\nright\n\n amount of fluff. Until about an hour in. When the perfect, adorable little dog companion of the main character, brutally died.\n\n\nAgain, they all wanted to make it perfectly clear that \n\nJiro\n\n picked the movie. It's her fault.\n\n\nIt was a heart-breaking scene, with the poor little dog getting hurt saving his owner and dying while the main character held him, sobbing. By the end of the scene \n\neverybody\n\n that was watching couldn't help but tear up at least. Most of the girls were full on sobbing, with Kaminari and Izuku joining that group.\n\n\nAnd it was upon this sad, slightly embarrassing scene that Kirishima and Katsuki walked in on, after arriving back at the dorms fresh from a gym session.\n\n\nIt, admittedly, must have looked quite pathetic. Nine sixteen year old's gathered in a shitty-looking blanket fort, noses running, tears flowing, the only ones who were even remotely composed being Momo and Iida, who had sniffed exactly thrice before refusing to look directly at the TV.\n\n\nKirishima entered first, taking a single look around the room before landing on the screen and, apparently recognising the movie, snorting in understanding. Then came in Katsuki, who immediately locked eyes with Izuku and dropped his gaze into an unimpressed, half-lidded glare.\n\n\nAnd Izuku started crying even \n\nharder.\n\n\n\nBefore anyone could even attempt to predict what was about to occur, Izuku jumped up from his spot on the blankets and ran towards Katsuki like a little kid welcoming his father back from the army. There was a brief moment where they thought he was about to \n\nattack\n\n Katsuki, or at least bowl him over; but instead he ran into the elder boy's chest and started \n\nsobbing into his shirt.\n\n\n\n\"The fuck is happening right now?\" Hakagure muttered, bewildered. Katsuki, for some reason not even remotely as confused as everybody thought he would, and not at all annoyed or disgusted as it felt he lawfully \n\nshould\n\n fucking be, just stayed stock still, allowing his shirt to collect the tears and snot no doubt pouring out of Izuku's buried face.\n\n\nHe passed unimpressed eyes over to the TV, which Momo had paused out of pure bafflement, and his eyes widened in recognition, before he threw his head back and let out a long, irritated groan.\n\n\nKirishima, mouth slightly open, subtly lifted his phone from his back pocket and tried to take a photo, before turning and widening his eyes at Kaminari pointedly, as if to say \n\n\u2018you seeing this shit, man?\u2019.\n\n\n\nHe was definitely seeing it. They all were.\n\n\n\"Why the \n\nfuck,\"\n\n Katsuki ground out, lowering his head again to glare at the general group, \"Would you let him watch this kind of fucking movie?\"\n\n\nIzuku blubbered into his collarbone, \"I-it was su-uch a good do-o-g, and now it's \n\nd-ead,\"\n\n\n\n\"No shit it's dead,\" Katsuki did not give him much sympathy, although to the group's fascination he did lift one of his arms to pat Izuku on the shoulder consolingly. \"It got fucking shot. I \n\ntold\n\n you when it came out not to watch this piece of shit!\"\n\n\nIzuku sniffed, shaking slightly and still muffled from Katsuki's shirt. \"His n-name was- \n\nSnowdrop!\" \n\nHe wailed, mournfully. Katsuki rolled his eyes.\n\n\n\"Fucking American trash-ass name,\" He grumbled. \"Fucking \n\nSnowdrop,\n\n s' the creativity of a fucking electric fan.\"\n\n\nIt was worth pointing out that by this point in time Izuku was the only one crying. This was directly because everybody else in the room was simply too confused and a \n\nlittle\n\n bit too enamoured by the display going on in front of them to give even a \n\nsingle\n\n shit about some fake dead dog lying in its own blood on the paused screen of the TV. Uraraka and Asui had gone back to eating popcorn. Kirishima seemed to be filming.\n\n\nFinally, Katsuki pulled Izuku back slightly and proceeded to \n\ncup his face in his palms,\n\n angling his head down so that their faces were only inches away from being pressed together.\n\n\n\"You,\" Katsuki enunciated clearly, while Izuku sniffed pathetically. \"Are fucking \n\nridiculous. \n\nThe dog is not dead. The dog is an \n\nactor,\n\n and it is doing its job very well. Do you know what that means?\"\n\n\n\"Mm-mm,\" Still teary-eyed but paying attention, Izuku shook his head, taking Katsuki's hands with him.\n\n\n\"It means that the second that scene was done, the dog got to have a \n\nshit-ton\n\n of its favourite treats. That dog is in nothing but bliss right now.\" Katsuki claimed firmly, narrowing his eyes. \"Understand?\"\n\n\nHesitantly, Izuku sniffed once more, thinking it over. Slowly, he nodded his head, and Katsuki nodded in unison, before releasing his face. \"Go to bed.\" He demanded.\n\n\nTo their audiences utter delight and incredulousness, Izuku didn't even put up a fight. He just nodded, collecting his pillow and blanket from the mess on the floor and muttering a small good night to the remaining group; exiting the common areas. Katsuki turned and cupped his hands around his mouth just after he left.\n\n\n\"You're a fucking \n\nPUSSY\n\n Deku,\" He hollered, before turning back to the room of silent spectators. \"Next time you fucking google if the dog lives or not \n\nbefore\n\n you start watching. Got it?\"\n\n\nAnd, completely blind-sided, the audience had nothing to do but silently nod their heads in agreement. Katsuki jerked his head in satisfaction before turning and leaving himself, once again ruining any sense of normalcy in the class and then walking off without a \n\ncare in the world\n\n for the mental mess he was leaving behind for them all to clean up.\n\n\nUtter carelessness, it was. Selfish.\n\n\nThe common room remained silent for a good nine seconds after the Izuku-Katsuki duo left it. Uraraka was the one that finally broke it.\n\n\n\"They \n\nhave\n\n to be dating-\"\n\n\n\"That proves \n\nnothing!\"\n\n Asui interrupted, and Uraraka quickly held up a finger.\n\n\n\"I feel like it proves a lot, actually-\"\n\n\n\"-You're only seeing shit because you're \n\nlooking\n\n for it,\"\n\n\n\"What are you, a psychiatrist? They fucking love each other Tsuyu,\"\n\n\n\"And what are you, a goddamn conspiracy theorist? Todo's already been through so much, at least let him have his \n\nown\n\n hobby-\"\n\n\n\"-You just \n\nrefuse\n\n to see the truth, don't you?\"\n\n\n\"You guys,\" Kirishima cut off the bickering girls, gesturing to the closed door both Izuku and Katsuki had gone through. \"That was fucking \n\nwild,\n\n right? It's not just me?\"\n\n\n\"I swear to god,\" Kaminari carried on, nodding in agreement. \"Ever since I started actually paying attention to Bakugou and Mido's interactions, they've been acting like, super weird compared to what I expected.\"\n\n\n\"Because they're \n\ndating-\"\n\n Uraraka attempted to say, only to get abruptly muffled by Asui's palm over her mouth, shoving her whole weight onto her until the two fell over into the pile of pillows together.\n\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" Kirishima asked. Iida sighed, lifting his glasses to rub at the bridge of his nose tiredly.\n\n\n\"Uraraka and Todoroki came up with a- \n\ntheory,\n\n shortly after Midoriya was seen drawing on Bakugou's arms during the safety assembly a few weeks ago.\" He explained. \"They believe the two are in a romantic relationship, and are simply not 'out' yet, thus attempting to hide it. Asui does not believe it. \n\nRegardless,\"\n\n He pointed out, as Kirishima and Kaminari's jaws both dropped, the others in the group somehow managing to become even more invested than before. \"It is none of our business and I recommend that all of us make an effort to ignore them and \n\nstay out of it.\"\n\n\n\nKirishima pointed at Uraraka. \"You think they're like. Together?\"\n\n\n\"What other explanation \n\nis there!?\"\n\n Uraraka exclaimed, shoving Asui away from her. \"The tired hugs, the allowed closeness of the drawing, and now Mido's actively seeking out Bakugou when he's upset! That's for \n\nsure\n\n love stuff,\" She folded her arms as Kirishima let this theory sink in, clearly having never once thought about the possibility before just then.\n\n\n\"That's so fucked,\" Kaminari whispered, horrified at the prospect. Asui nodded at him in agreement.\n\n\n\u201cPlus, what about that last comment? That\u2019s not very \n\nloving,\n\n is it?\u201d She claimed.\n\n\n\"Why would they be so obvious about it if they were actually trying to hide it?\" Hakagure asked, confused. Uraraka squinted, thinking.\n\n\n\"Maybe they're not hiding it,\" Momo shrugged, ignoring Iida's pointed mutters of violating their classmates' privacy by continuing the conversation. \"What were they gonna go, stand on the desks in class and announce it? Has anyone actually asked Bakugou or Midoriya if any of them are dating anyone? Wouldn't that clear things up a bit?\"\n\n\nEveryone looked at her in quiet contemplation, eyes wide and mouths open. It was very obvious that no, that idea had not occurred to anyone as of yet. Momo rolled her eyes in exasperation.\n\n\n\"Future greatest Heroes, my ass,\" She muttered.\n\n\nThey didn't get the chance to interrogate either of the two. Mostly because asking \n\nKatsuki\n\n if he was in a romantic relationship with anybody when he didn't explicitly offer up the information himself seemed like a great way to ask for a painful but swift death.\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku on the other hand had a different issue. He wasn't the type to go violent after a personal question, no, but there was something about his innocent, \n\nearnest\n\n face, that looked at his classmates with such \n\npolite cheerfulness.\n\n\n\nNobody could quite bring themselves to look directly at those baby greens and mercilessly ask such a personal question as 'so are you dating Bakugou? You know, the guy who beats the shit out of you during 90% of our Heroics classes?'\n\n\nIt was \n\ninhumane.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe class was still fighting over who had to actually ask, so finding definite answers was put on pause for the time being. They mostly just watched the two interact warily, as if studying two volatile animals and waiting for an attack to happen. Except an attack would be seen as normal, and they were really looking for signs of romantic affection.\u00a0\n\n\nBut for the next few weeks, nothing seemed out of the ordinary. Katsuki mostly ignored Izuku, apart from throwing insults across the classroom and hurling explosions in his face during training; and they settled down into what looked to be a relatively \n\npeaceful\n\n era of class 1-a.\u00a0\n\n\nWell, peaceful might be a stretch, but it was \n\nnormal\n\n at least.\n\n\nThe latest piece of information to make the rounds within the class was Aizawa's announcement that they would be taking a little overnight training session soon, designed to help them learn self sufficiency during emergencies where outside help wouldn't be available, like missions interrupted by weather or natural disasters that could leave them stranded. All Pro's had to have up-to-par outdoor survival skills, Aizawa said.\n\n\nThe class said this and immediately cheered; 'Class Camping Trip!' So it was clear they were taking it seriously. Aizawa just sighed and told them not to eat any wild mushrooms.\n\n\n\"Good to know you have faith in us, Sensei!\" Kirishima grinned, giving a thumbs up. Aizawa left the room without a word.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nThe class was given three copies of a map, the most basic survival tools they'd ever seen, and were dropped off in a forest with instructions to split up and make their ways to the three camps marked down for them. The only confirmation they had there there wouldn't be some secret battle they would have to fight was the fact that they had been told not to bother with their Hero uniforms, instead embarking on their little hike in their usual school jackets and ties. It was eerily familiar to the training camp, something that the class shared with each other through wary glances and a careful understanding not to \n\nsay\n\n such a comparison to Katsuki.\u00a0\n\n\n\"If the League of Villains shows up this time, I'm fucking suing UA.\"\u00a0\n\n\nOr, never mind, Katsuki brought it up himself.\n\n\n\"C'mon Bakubro, this time will be fun! We won't even have teachers waiting for us at the camps to force us to train all day, we can just enjoy the scenery!\" Kirishima attempted to throw an arm around Katsuki's shoulders and was \n\nimmediately\n\n shoved off. Katsuki snatched one of the maps out of Ashido's hand and scanned the locations of the camps.\u00a0\n\n\n\"Alright, let's get this shit over with. We're splitting up into three teams, two groups of seven and one of six. Shitty-hair, Dunce-face, Round-face, Ponytail, Icyhot, Deku, you're with me, ....and I don't give a fuck what the rest of you extras do.\" And with that, Katsuki stormed off into the forest, not looking back once.\u00a0\n\n\nThe class looked at each other, unsure of how to proceed, until Izuku picked up one of the sleeping bag rolls and started skipping along after him. \"Ok, Kacchan!\"\n\n\n\"Well, good luck?\" Asui offered, with a shrug. Uraraka sighed, and the chosen group began collecting their share of the camping gear.\u00a0\n\n\n\"Yeah, thanks. See you guys later?\" Kaminari waved back as they started to trudge after the duo. As they left, Kirishima leant in to Kaminari to whisper.\n\n\n\"So how do we think this is going to go?\" He asked. Kaminari considered his answer carefully.\u00a0\n\n\n\"Either the worst night of our lives, or the most entertaining. No inbetween.\"\u00a0\n\n\nKirishima nodded in agreement. \"Glad we're both on the same page.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nThe 'camp' was very disappointing. It could barely even be called a camp. There was a small clearing within the depths of the forest with a small stream nearby, and a few logs around the charred remains of what had to be a campfire.\n\n\n\"This is...\" Uraraka tried to search for the right words. \"Are we sure this is where we're supposed to stop?\"\u00a0\n\n\nKatsuki harumphed, \"You wanna be the fucking navigator? This is the goddamn camp.\"\u00a0\n\n\nUraraka held her hands up in defence, and Momo winced. \"Well, Aizawa-sensei \n\ndid\n\n say it was going to be survival training, not camping. It's not like there was going to be a hotel waiting for us.\"\n\n\n\"Still, I was hoping for like, a packet of marshmallows or something.\" Kirishima mumbled, and Kaminari snickered at him as the group began to spread out a bit, getting to know the area.\n\n\n\"All we have are the sleeping bags, cooking supplies, and some basic food rations. It's lucky we're only here for one night, otherwise we could be in trouble,\" Izuku said, rummaging through the kitchen duffle Aizawa had dumped with them before he'd sped off to leave them to their fate. \"Do you think the other two groups have the same stuff as us?\"\n\n\n\n\"No,\" \n\nKatsuki drew out sarcastically, \"He's given \n\nus\n\n this, and then the other guys get Taco fucking Bell.\"\n\n\nIzuku's head snapped over to narrow his eyes indignantly at the blond's back, while Kirishima's knees bent slightly as he grabbed on to Kaminari's arm, head ducking down while he sniggered at the verbal barbs.\n\n\n\"We just got here; could you not immediately start fighting with each other?\" Todoroki asked, and Momo nodded in agreement.\u00a0\n\n\n\"He's right,\" She said, even as Katsuki gave her a disgusted look at the concept and Izuku continued to stare at him slyly out of the corner of his eyes. \"Let's just get everybody's sleeping bags set up and start making food.\"\u00a0\n\n\nIt wasn't particularly hard to set up their camp. Their objective was only to stay alive, not to complete any other tasks or have anybody attempt to stop them, so it wasn't exactly a challenge; especially with Katsuki on their team, of whom was a camping \n\nexpert\n\n as it turned out. It did end up feeling a \n\nlittle\n\n like a camping trip, with the way Todoroki and Uraraka had laid their sleeping bags in a wide circle close to the fire, and the way Kirishima, Izuku, and Kaminari had played Marco-Polo in the stream while Katsuki and Momo took over the cooking (read; Katsuki cooked while Momo huffed and got her hand slapped away the second she attempted to get involved in any way.)\u00a0\n\n\nSomehow, against all odds, they managed to keep a small amount of peace during the afternoon; something that no doubt \n\nnobody\n\n was going to believe when they got back to UA the next day. Sure, there were some close calls when Izuku attempted to highly praise the meal Katsuki had prepared and Katsuki threatened to shove the plate down his \n\nshirt\n\n (out of gratitude, surely), but Kirishima luckily managed to de-escalate that particular brewing battle.\n\n\nThe weirdest thing that happened was after Izuku had gotten out of the river, leaving Kirishima and Kaminari to wrestle in the water while he dried off with his shirt. Kirishima had Kaminari trapped in a headlock until they'd heard Izuku's high pitched, terror filled shrieks fill the air.\u00a0\n\n\n\"KACCHAN! \n\nKACCHAN-!\"\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nImmediately on alert and worried, Kirishima dropped his victim in the water and they both looked up the bank to see Izuku rushing towards the campfire, pure fear on his face as he scrambled up the grass.\u00a0\n\n\n\"What, what-? Jesus Christ, what?\" Katsuki rushed out, standing up from where he'd been stirring a pan and taking a few steps towards the boy while still brandishing a metal spatula. Todoroki, Uraraka, and Momo all looked startled, searching the area as if a villain was going to appear from somewhere and attack them. \"What's wrong?\"\n\n\nIzuku ran over to Katsuki, breathing hard for a moment before spinning to hide behind him, gripping the back of his jacket and attempting to duck underneath the fabric, almost shoving Katsuki off of his feet in the process.\n\n\n\"The fuck-\" Katsuki struggled to maintain his balance and ripped his jacket out of Izuku's grip, turning to face him again. This did not deter Izuku, who instead just lifted up one side of the \n\nfront\n\n of Katsuki's jacket instead. Katsuki threw his hands up incredulously, giving up and letting the smaller boy perch under the fabric of his uniform like an umbrella. Kirishima and Kaminari clung to each other, still up to their waists in water, staring with nothing but fascination.\n\n\n\"You \n\nsafe\n\n now?\" He snapped pointedly, raising an eyebrow. Izuku sniffed.\u00a0\n\n\n\"There was a wasp...\"\n\n\nKatsuki scoffed. The others were just amazed that he was still allowing the physical contact Izuku was initiating. Todoroki cocked his head.\u00a0\n\n\n\"...I don't see a wasp?\"\n\n\nIzuku huffed, abruptly wrenching the jacket off of himself and narrowing heated eyes at Todoroki. \"Well there isn't \n\nnow,\n\n but there was-!\"\n\n\nIzuku cut himself off with wide eyes as a faint but audible buzzing noise was heard by those near the campfire, and he shrieked before shoving himself back under the cover of Katsuki's jacket. Said umbrella-replacement sighed in defeat and forced himself to not stumble under the shifting weight.\n\n\n\"Just stay still,\" Katsuki drawled, unimpressed. \"It's not gonna fuckin' hurt you.\"\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku made an untrusting noise from where he was slouched, eyes shut tight. \"Just tell me when it's gone!\"\n\n\nKatsuki rolled his eyes, still and unbothered by the wasp still flying around relatively near his head. Uraraka was staring at the pair with a triumphant look in her eyes, and her gaze panned until it landed on the other duo in the water, who she grinned at.\n\n\n\n\"In. Love.\"\n\n She mouthed. Kirishima rolled his eyes.\n\n\n\n\"Ask then,\"\n\n He mouthed back mockingly. \n\n\"Bitch.\"\n\n\n\nKaminari snorted and promptly lost his footing, toppling over and under the water with a splash.\u00a0\n\n\n\"It's gone now, dicknerd.\" Katsuki said, shoving his limpet away from him. Momo snorted as the blond made his way back to his food, taking over from her and continuing to stir.\u00a0\n\n\n\"Dick-nerd; that's a new one,\" She commented. Izuku winced, scratching the back of his head as he made to sit down on one of the other logs.\u00a0\n\n\n\"It's uh... it's really... not...\" He admitted. \"You guys just haven't always been around.\"\n\n\n\u201cAre you really that afraid of wasps?\u201d Todoroki asked innocently, and Izuku blushed.\n\n\n\u201cThe buzzing just makes me paranoid\u2026\u201d\n\n\nUraraka looked like she was about to say something, when Katsuki interrupted them by turning down to the river, taking his pan off of the fire.\u00a0\n\n\n\"You two better get your dipshit asses out that fucking water; I ain't waiting on you to serve this shit up!\" He hollered, beginning to divide the food while Kirishima and Kaminari scrambled to make it out of the river, sabotaging each other as they fought for first place in their little race up to the camp.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nAfter that things were calm for the rest of the evening, and it was Momo who suggested they get an early night, considering Aizawa had warned them of an early pickup from the training site the next morning, and point deductions for the groups that weren't first to show up. So they decided to get a bit of an early night.\n\n\nIt was kind of fun, Kirishima thought, to have a mini camping trip with their little group. Kaminari was convinced that Aizawa had set up the assignment simply to get a \n\nbreak\n\n from them all, but Kirishima wasn't complaining. It reminded him of when he was a kid and his family would go camp overnight on the local beach; no tents, just under the stars as they enjoyed each other's company.\n\n\nThey all settled down into the sleeping bags fairly quickly, going off into small groups to freshen up by the stream before bedding down for the night. Kirishima couldn't help but notice when Izuku and Todoroki came back together that Izuku seemed a little bit put off by the fact that the only non-occupied bags were the ones furthest from Katsuki, Kaminari and Kirishima having snatched the ones on either side of him in their little circle. But he didn't say anything, just frowning slightly and hesitating before settling down in his own sleeping bag. Nobody else seemed to notice the slight pause except for Katsuki himself, who snorted quietly to himself before turning around to face away from the circle.\n\n\nSurprisingly, despite the early night and lack of proper fighting, the hike through the woods had taken a lot out of the group, and Kirishima found it easy for his eyelids to grow heavy, the quiet yet peaceful atmosphere that the burning embers of their fire gave, a slow warmth emitting from the flames and gently rocking the group into a peaceful sleep.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd then Kirishima was jolted awake. In the middle of the night.\u00a0\n\n\nNow, his first thought was \n\nfucks sake Aizawa-sensei, I knew you'd spring something on us when we were least expecting it, \n\nbefore realising that there was no actual sign of any attack. Confused, he continued to stare up at the clear, starry night sky, before finally pinning down the noise that must be the culprit towards his sudden awakening.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSomebody,\n\n was tossing and turning in their sleeping bag. And they \n\nwouldn't fucking stop.\n\n\n\nSlowly, Kirishima turned around in his own sleeping bag, blinking as his sleepy eyes slowly got used to the light coming from the barely burning embers on the campfire, only to then force them to dim down and focus on the darkness \n\nbehind\n\n the fire instead. Once he'd gotten used to the low light, he was able to identify Izuku's sleeping bag to be the one that was making noise, with the boy tossing and turning uncomfortably within the fabric. Kirishima watched in confusion as Izuku finally snapped up into a sitting position, huffing and looking around at their group with narrowed eyes.\n\n\nIzuku didn't seem to notice that Kirishima was awake, and so the red-head got the perfect view as he slowly stood up, abandoning his sleeping bag and picking his way over to where Katsuki was fast asleep nearby.\u00a0\n\n\nBaffled, Kirishima watched as Izuku poked Katsuki's sleeping form with his toe, before ducking down next to him. The darkness masked most details of what was going on, but Kirishima heard a\n\n lot\n\n of shuffling and sleeping bag rustles, and Katsuki groaning slightly in his sleep as Izuku's shadow seemed to \n\nmerge\n\n with Katsuki's.\n\n\nKirishima was \n\nnot\n\n sure what the fuck he'd just witnessed, \n\nor\n\n how to deal with it. Uraraka's theories about the two secretly dating flashed through his mind, leading to some \n\nhorrible\n\n ideas as to what Izuku was doing, before for his own sanity, he banished them from his mind and determinedly clenched his eyes shut.\u00a0\n\n\nAbsolutely not. He was \n\nnot\n\n having those kinds of thoughts going through his mind. \n\nEver.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nThankfully, Kirishima had fallen asleep quite quickly, and when he woke up in the morning he wasn't even completely sure it hadn't been a dream. He watched the still slightly dark sky of the early morning in contentment.\u00a0\n\n\nSitting up and being greeted with Uraraka and Kaminari's jaw-dropping stares towards Katsuki's sleeping bag quickly vanquished those hopes.\u00a0\n\n\n\"Oh my god, this is incredible.\" Kaminari whispered, Uraraka nodding in agreement with shining eyes.\u00a0\n\n\n\"You cannot argue with this. This is \n\ndefinitely\n\n proof. They \n\nhave\n\n to be dating.\"\n\n\nKaminari didn't take his eyes off of Katsuki's sleeping bag as Todoroki slowly woke up and glanced, confused, at Izuku's empty bed, before noticing what the other three were staring at and abruptly freezing.\u00a0\n\n\n\"It's not proof unless you ask and they confirm it,\" Kirishima whispered back, as Momo finally joined them in the land of the living, leaving the iconic duo to be the only sleeping ones left.\u00a0\n\n\n\"Fuck off, this is \n\nlove\n\n shit.\" Uraraka claimed, quietly.\n\n\nAdmittedly, it \n\nwas\n\n quite damning. Looking back, Kirishima could now accurately assign the noises Izuku had been making during the night to the action of unzipping Katsuki's sleeping bag, and somehow \n\ncrawling inside next to him. \n\nThe two were still asleep, borderline cuddling, with Izuku's nose pressed into the crook of Katsuki's armpit as he snuggled into the blond's side. Kirishima came to the quick realisation that as Katsuki had not woken up during the night, he had absolutely \n\nno\n\n idea that he was about to wake up to Izuku Midoriya cuddling into him.\u00a0\n\n\n\"Dude,\" He breathed, eyes wide. \"When Bakugou wakes up, Mido's \n\ndead.\"\n\n\n\n\"Unless they're boyfriends,\" Uraraka reminded them, to which Kirishima rolled his eyes.\u00a0\n\n\n\"There could be a death either way,\" Momo pointed out. \"When he finds out we've just been watching them for the past few minutes.\"\n\n\n\"She's right,\" Kirishima startled slightly at the realisation. \"Maybe we should-\"\u00a0\n\n\nBut it was too late, because there was a shifting noise from the double-packed sleeping bag that immediately stole all of their attention; not that it had ever really lost it.\n\n\nKatsuki's eyes slowly shuttered slightly as he came to awareness. Eyes still closed, he adjusted his position slightly, before abruptly freezing in place. The rest of them held their breaths, knowing they should run but unable to move as the blond was obviously noticing for the first time that there was somebody\n\n in\n\n his sleeping bag \n\nwith him.\n\n\nAnd then Katsuki abruptly brought an arm up, swinging it over to lightly rest on Midoriya's sleeping face. His eyes were still shut as he looked to be feeling around, patting the green-headed boy's cheek and feeling the shape of his nose, before apparently recognising Izuku's head from touch alone, and he relaxed.\n\n\"Clingy nerd,\" He mumbled to himself quietly, low enough that the rest of the group could barely hear. Then Katsuki finally opened his eyes, completely missing the five students staring at him with open mouths and instead looking down at the Izuku that was still tucked into his side, arms having come up to fist handfuls of the blond's shirt, looking remarkably peaceful.\n\n\nKatsuki began to lightly tap Izuku's cheek, a small, Kirishima swore \n\nfond\n\n smile on his face, as Izuku finally began to stir, his eyebrows furrowing at the (less violent than expected) awakening.\n\n\n\"C'mon, up. Up now.\" Katsuki mumbled, still in that soft yet quietly gruff morning voice that Kirishima \n\nwould\n\n be laughing at Uraraka later for blushing at. Izuku sighed into Kartsuki's shirt, somehow sounding disappointed without saying anything. \"Morning, dicknerd.\" Katsuki said, finally running out of patience and giving Izuku a slightly harder push, moving his torso out the way so Izuku's head would fall to the ground.\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku grumbled, finally opening his eyes and pushing himself up until he was leaning on his elbows. Again, somehow, he didn't notice any of the others, head instead turning away from them to look down at Katsuki. \"What time is it?\"\u00a0\n\n\n\"Fuck if I know, early.\" Katsuki shrugged, apparently content with not getting up for now and looking up at Izuku. He nudged Izuku in the side with his knee. \"What was it, nightmares or general Deku-clingyness?\"\n\n\nIzuku rolled his eyes. \"Not nightmares, just got a little cold. Every other time I've gone camping we've shared a tent or been right next to each other; it felt weird.\"\n\n\nKatsuki snorted slightly, and Kirishima suddenly felt bad, like they were watching an intimately private moment between two people that were \n\nobviously\n\n way closer than they'd ever realised. He turned to convey this in a look to Kaminari, receiving an understanding nod. They didn't get a chance to do anything about it, however, because Izuku finally stood up and stretched his arms, looking around the camp area and noticing the five people still watching him. He paused. Katsuki followed Izuku's eyes and also saw them, giving no room to pretend that they \n\nhadn't\n\n just been staring at the two for the past five minutes.\n\n\n\"Oh, morning guys; didn't realise you were awake!\" Izuku let his arms drop, his usual cheerful attitude coming through without preamble.\u00a0\n\n\n\"Morning!\" Kirishima rushed out, feeling oddly like a child caught with his hand in the cookie jar. \"We were just- we-\"\n\n\nKatsuki snorted. \"Were just being weird as shit?\" He guessed. Slightly taken aback by the casual and non-angry attitude towards them, Kirishima didn't answer in time, and Katsuki steamrolled forward to get up, cracking his neck. \"Alright, we don't have time for this bullshit. If we wanna be the first group back we're leaving soon. We need to clean up the camp.\"\u00a0\n\n\n\"Wha- um,\" Kaminari turned to give Kirishima an incredulous look as Katsuki walked off. \"He doesn't care?\"\u00a0\n\n\nKirishima didn't know what to do. He shrugged. \"I have no fucking clue; all I know is that we have one \n\nhell\n\n of a story to tell the others when we get back to UA.\"\n\n\n\"Lets see Tsuyu deny them dating after this,\" Uraraka muttered quietly once Izuku left hearing range, a righteous glint in her eye.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Whatever's\n\n going on between them, I can't believe it took us so long to notice.\" Kirishima said, getting up out of his sleeping bag and going through the motions of neatly rolling it up.\n\n\n\"Maybe they've been replaced by clones, and the real Bakugou and Midoriya still don't like each other?\" Todoroki offered. Momo gave him a look.\n\n\n\"You really need to stop watching conspiracy theory videos on YouTube.\"\n\n\nAfter the camping trip, the class just became more and more confused about the nature of Izuku and Katsuki's relationship.\n\n\nUraraka, as well as most of the class, had taken the whole sleeping bag incident as confirmation that the two \n\nwere\n\n dating, to the point where Asui, Kaminari, and Kirishima were the only ones still not sure.\n\n\nThe class came to the conclusion that not only \n\nwere\n\n Katsuki and Izuku dating, but that them dating had been the norm for a while. They decided, for some reason, that since both the boys hadn't been in the least bit bothered by their classmates viewing such damning evidence, that they must have \n\nnever\n\n been hiding it, and it was only the class's lack of observation skills that had led them to take so long in noticing the relationship.\n\n\nSo out of embarrassment, the class had apparently decided to act as if they'd \n\nalways known.\n\n\n\nThe three non-believers had no idea how that was going to turn out, but they could agree on one thing: It was going to be entertaining, and probably slightly terrifying.\n\n\nThe best thing about it was watching their classmates desperately try to excuse and come up with reasons for the moments where Katsuki and Izuku's actions \n\ndidn't\n\n seem very loving, like now, when Uraraka, Kaminari, and Iida had come across the \n\ndelightful\n\n scene of Katsuki in the dorm halls.\n\n\nHe was standing outside Izuku's door, a long grey scarf tied expertly and tightly from Izuku's door handle to the handle of the room opposite. Izuku, inside his room, looked to be trying to leave, however as all dorm doors opened inward to the rooms, the scarf forced the door to stay shut.\n\n\nIzuku sounded like he was very confused about what was blocking his escape. Katsuki looked like he was having the time of his \n\nlife.\n\n\n\n\"I- Kacchan the doors stuck,\" Slightly muffled, Izuku sounded confused from behind the door. Katsuki bent over slightly, clutching his stomach as he made the effort to keep his laughter silent. He breathed slowly, composing himself before answering.\n\n\n\"What do you mean?\" He managed, his voice only just sounding even. Iida and Uraraka gave him twin unimpressed looks, while Kaminari stared in fascination. Katsuki, they were fairly sure, hadn't even noticed them yet.\n\n\n\"Kacchan, I can't get out! What's wrong with the door?!\" Izuku's frustrated complaints were paired with the repeated rattling of the doorknob, but the scarf held tight.\n\n\n\"Beats me,\" Katsuki said, wiping a tear from his eye and composing himself. \"Maybe you're just not trying hard enough?\"\n\n\n\"Can you use your quirk to get it open? I don't want to have to smash through.\"\n\n\n\"What, you think an explosion would be \n\nless\n\n destructive? The hinges probably just need oiling or something, try again.\"\n\n\nThere was silence for a moment.\n\n\nThe doorknob rattled around\n\n vigorously,\n\n and Katsuki collapsed against the wall, pressing a hand against his mouth as he heaved for air.\n\n\n\"Kacchan- HELP ME!\" Izuku demanded, possibly sensing Katsuki's lack of attention through the wood. Katsuki came up for breath just long enough to respond in a very Bakugou-standard bland tone.\n\n\n\"I am helping, what do you mean?\"\n\n\nThe doorknob rattled so hard the door started to shake, and Katsuki moved to a standing position, crossing his arms and staring at the door with a malicious grin, so wide it almost looked \n\nunnatural.\n\n\n\nHe finally noticed the three students watching him, and, completely unashamed, he waved.\n\n\nKaminari waved back.\n\n\n\"WHY WON'T THE DOOR OPEN!?\" Came the angry yell from Izuku.\n\n\n\"Genuinely Deku, I have no fucking clue.\" A lie.\u00a0\n\n\nUraraka shook her head in disappointment.\n\n\nThere was a thump from the other side of the door, and Izuku let out a frustrated groan.\n\n\n\"It's a mystery,\" Katsuki mused.\n\n\n\"I don't understand why it would be \n\nsticking\n\n like this!\"\n\n\n\"Happens to the best of us.\"\n\n\n\"Kacchan!\"\n\n\n\"There is nothing I can do for you, kiddo.\"\n\n\n\"UGH.\"\n\n\nThe three watching didn't really know what to say.\n\n\n\"Doesn't seem very.... \n\nromantic\n\n of him,\" Kaminari tested the air after they'd abandoned Izuku to Katsuki's torture. They had no idea how long Katsuki was going to keep the poor boy trapped, but frankly neither of the three of them had the energy to deal with it at that point in time.\n\n\n\"Well that doesn't-\" Uraraka's mouth flapped. \"Bakugou's always been an asshole, this is probably just him teasing his boyfriend a little!\"\n\n\n\"He did call Midoriya 'kiddo',\" Iida pointed out, begrudgingly.\n\n\n\"Well some people have things that they're into! I don't-\" Uraraka paused as both Kaminari and Iida had audible reactions to her statement, and she winced, thinking back through her words. \"Yeah ok, I admit that was a bad one to say, I take it back.\"\n\n\n\"Regardless, their relationship is none of our business, and I recommend we leave it alone.\" Iida decided for them, and Uraraka sighed before reluctantly nodding in agreement.\n\n\nKaminari rolled his eyes in amusement. \n\nDefinitely\n\n entertaining.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\"Whose is this?\" Katsuki asked, wandering into the common room and gesturing to one of the hoodies draped over the couch. There were a few strewn around, a group of the students having decided to go to the gym together on a particularly cold Saturday. They'd come back to the dorms sweating, unanimously taking off any extra layers they had on and dropping onto the couches in fits of sweat and heavy breathing after their intense workouts.\n\n\n\"Uh, that one's Todoroki's, I think,\" Kirishima managed, barely looking up from where he was ragdolled in an armchair. Katsuki grunted before pointing to another hoodie crumpled up on the floor.\n\n\n\"And that?\"\n\n\n\"It's Mido's,\" Uraraka responded. Katsuki hummed, this time sounding more appeased, before confidentially grabbing it and shoving it on over the thin shirt he'd been wearing. Uraraka was so tired she could barely be bothered to turn and give a suggestive eyebrow-waggle to the others.\n\n\n\"Kacchan,\" Izuku whined. \"You can't just take my stuff without aski-\"\n\n\n\"Who's tank top is that?\" Katsuki asked him, pointedly. Izuku glanced down at what he was wearing, which, now that they were paying attention, didn't exactly look like the kind of clothing Izuku would own; it being black with white lettering declaring 'Talk to me and I'll stab you' on it. He deflated immediately, going back to staring at the ceiling.\n\n\n\"Yeah, ok.\"\n\n\nKatsuki snorted and walked away without another word.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nAnother thing the class had noticed now that they were paying attention to the details of Katsuki's and Izuku's relationship, was that there were a lot of moments where Izuku seemed to... \n\nlook\n\n to Katsuki for things.\n\n\nFor lack of a better term.\n\n\nA prime example of this was when Asui had been flipping a pen around her knuckles while they were hanging out in the kitchen, and Izuku, fascinated, asked for her to show him how to do it.\n\n\nShe agreed with a laugh, and although it took a good twenty minutes, Izuku eventually got the hang of the simpler movements enough that he could keep it up for at least thirty seconds at a time.\n\n\n\"You're actually not bad at that,\" Asui mused, watching him gently flip the biro around in his hands. He beamed at her, proudly.\n\n\n\"And here I thought you were so clumsy you could barely walk,\" Uraraka teased, leaning forward to rest her elbows on the kitchen counter.\n\n\nIzuku chuckled, before his eyes lit up and he stopped, catching the pen smoothly in his hand. \"Where's- I need Kacchan, where's Kacchan?\"\n\n\nThe girls furrowed their eyebrows, sharing a glance. \"Bakugou? I don't know... why?\" Asui asked.\n\n\n\"Bakugou went to the store with Todo like, twenty minutes ago. He'll probably be back any second,\" Sero said, glancing up from where he'd been scrolling on his phone at the other end of the room. There was the noise of a door opening and Todoroki's voice, and Sero nodded in satisfaction. \"Told ya.\"\n\n\n\"-Do not understand, they are both white powder, why would they not be interchangeable?\" Todoroki could be heard, followed by what sounded suspiciously like a hard slap upside the head.\n\n\n\"You're fucking useless at cooking, you know that? Salt and baking powder are \n\nnothing\n\n fucking alike, you \n\ncannot\n\n switch them around in meals!\" Katsuki snapped back. Izuku's eyes brightened and he jumped up.\n\n\n\"Kacchan! Come here, come look!\"\n\n\nKatsuki came into view, two shopping bags in hand as he blinked over at the overexcited Izuku. \"Mm?\" He questioned, dumping the bags on the table as Todoroki followed him into the kitchen.\n\n\n\"Look at what I learned,\" Izuku gushed, rushing up to Katsuki's side and moving the pen to the tips of his knuckle. Slowly, he began to do as Asui taught, and manoeuvred it around his fingers before grinning proudly up at Katsuki. Todoroki narrowed his eyes at Izuku, and the girls exchanged another look.\n\n\n\"Wow,\" Katsuki said in a bland but slightly amused tone, the kind of tone that one would use when humouring a small child. Asui squinted at him, but Izuku didn't seem to notice, instead grinning wider and nodding his head.\n\n\n\"Only took me twenty minutes!\"\n\n\n\"That's neat,\" Katsuki nodded his head slightly, clearly not interested yet for some reason not completely brushing the younger boy off like everybody else expected him to. \"Good job.\"\n\n\nJust to top the interaction off, Katsuki lifted him arm and patted Izuku on the head before abruptly turning away and demanded everybody get the fuck out the kitchen, so that he could unload all the groceries without them getting in the way. They skedaddled quickly, knowing how serious Katsuki got when it came to being in the kitchen, and Sero whistled lowly as he, Uraraka and Asui reconvened in the common rooms.\n\n\n\"Just saying, that didn't seem right, coming from a 'boyfriend'.\"\n\n\n\"That's what I was about to say!\" Asui agreed smugly. \"More like a parent with a toddler.\"\n\n\n\"What? He was supporting his partner's learning, how is that not cute?\"\n\n\n\"I didn't say it wasn't cute,\" Asui refuted Uraraka. \"I just said it wasn't \n\nromantic.\"\n\n\n\n\"That could so be romantic!\"\n\n\n\"Absolutely could not.\"\n\n\n\"Could too!\"\n\n\n\"Nope.\"\n\n\nSero rolled his eyes, amused and turning away from his classmates bickering, before landing his gaze on Todoroki, who was standing to the side and looking towards the kitchen with a slightly confused look.\n\n\n\"What?\" Sero asked, as the girls arguing faded into the background. Todoroki shrugged.\n\n\n\"You're both right. That interaction did not match up with the idea that Bakugou and Midoriya are romantically involved. It was more the sort of interaction I used to have with Fuyumi when I was younger,\" Todoroki said, looking like he was thinking hard. Sero narrowed his eyes, but the other boy just shrugged once more before turning and disappearing back to his dorm room.\n\n\nEyes still narrowed, Sero turned back towards the girls, opening his mouth to speak only to realise that at some point during his conversation with Todoroki, they'd apparently wandered off, leaving him completely alone.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nThe most damning evidence, admittedly, was the first time the class saw Izuku go up to bed before Katsuki.\n\n\nUsually, Katsuki was locked away in his room by nine PM sharp; however on this particular day Kirishima, Kaminari, and Ashido had borderline forced him into a study session with them in the common rooms, leading him to still be down and about, angrily moaning about how stupid they all were well past midnight. So for the first time in their lives, they got to watch what was apparently normal for Izuku to do before going up to bed.\n\n\n\"Alright,\" He said, glass of water in hand as he walked through the common rooms. \"I'm going to sleep, I'm half dead. See you all in the morning,\" He waved tiredly, and the three gave him half hearted goodbyes, still buried in textbooks.\n\n\nIzuku then looked over at Katsuki, who was in the middle of underlying and critiquing a passage Kaminari had written, albeit horribly.\n\n\n\"Night Kacchan, love you.\"\n\n\nThree heads snapped up immediately.\n\n\nKatsuki barely even glanced over, eyes flicking towards the green-headed boy before turning back to Kaminari's work. \"Mhm, night, love you too,\" He breathed, words coming out as casual as if he was commenting on the weather.\n\n\nAshido slapped Kirishima on the shoulder repeatedly as Izuku finally left, looking over at him in glee as if to check that yes, they had all witnessed the same act.\n\n\nKirishima rolled his eyes, because yeah, admittedly that \n\nwas\n\n some pretty damning evidence.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nA few days later, Izuku was playing a game on the common room TV with Uraraka, Iida, Ashido, and Kaminari, when Katsuki walked through, not even saying hi as he made his way to the kitchen. Izuku, however, perked up, as if finally finding somebody he'd been looking for.\n\n\n\"Ooo-! Kacchan! What's for dinne-?'\n\n\n\"Lasagna,\" Katsuki tiredly threw back, and Izuku yelled back a thanks before turning to resume their game.\n\n\nUraraka waggled her eyebrows suggestively. \"He cooks for you, huh?\"\n\n\nCome to think of it, Izuku and Katsuki didn't eat with the class that much in the evenings. Katsuki would come in sometimes if he wanted to cook something that required more space than his dorm room (which was basically kitted out with it's own kitchen, with the counter and the amount of appliances Katsuki had gotten in there), but Izuku usually said he already had his food sorted and so would disappear somewhere else around dinner time.\n\n\nIzuku giggled, looking slightly confused. \"Most of the time, but only because he doesn't trust me in the kitchen.\"\n\n\nUraraka beamed at him before pausing. \"Most of the time? How long?\"\n\n\n\"Since we first moved into the dorms...?\"\n\n\nUraraka nodded slowly, as if she'd found out important information but didn't quite want them to know she found it important. \"I see.\"\n\n\nKatsuki's head poked into the common room. \"Oi, nerd, clean your room before the food's ready.\"\n\n\nKaminari raised an eyebrow, and Izuku groaned. \"Can't I just finish this one game-?\"\n\n\n\n\"Deku.\"\n\n Katsuki warned, and Izuku slumped before putting down his controller.\n\n\n\"I'll be back in a few minutes, guys,\" He said, giving them a smile before leaving to, presumably, clean his room.\n\n\n\"I have never had a relationship where my partner \n\nforces\n\n me to clean my room...\" Ashido said, a small crease in her forehead.\n\n\n\"Well you've never had a relationship point blank,\" Kaminari pointed out, to Ashido's offended squawk.\n\n\n\"It does seem a little controlling...? Uraraka said, hesitantly. \"But Bakugou's a bit of a clean freak, maybe it's just their thing? We shouldn't judge.\"\n\n\n\"She's right,\" Iida nodded, although he looked a tad bit unsure himself. Slowly, the four turned back to their game.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nAfter a training session, Aizawa swept his eyes over the tired, sweaty students in front of him.\n\n\n\"Now, does anybody need to go to Recovery Girl?\" He asked, voice dead. Slowly everybody shook their heads, somehow managing to come out of their recent exercise without much more than a few bruises. Truly a miracle for class 1-A.\n\n\nIzuku, however, sniffed, before dragging his feet over to where Katsuki was standing, stretching out his arms.\n\n\n\"Kacchan, my leg hurts.\"\n\n\nKirishima narrowed his eyes dramatically. \"Aizawa-sensei just asked if anybody needed healing, and he goes to \n\nBakugou\n\n because he's hurt?\" He muttered.\n\n\n\"This is fascinating,\" Kaminari agreed, nodding.\n\n\n\"This is \n\nromantic,\"\n\n Ashido butted in quietly, and upon her friends scorn she scoffed. \"They literally said they loved each other, you cannot doubt me anymore.\"\n\n\nKirishima and Kaminari made twin sceptic faces, and Kaminari was the one to joke, \"We \n\ncan\n\n as long as we blame it on homophobia.\"\n\n\nKirishima, bisexual, snorted into his palm, and Ashido smacked Kaminari exasperatedly.\n\n\n\"Yeah, fuck the gays,\" Kirishima tacked on with a grin, just to annoy her.\n\n\nThey were brought out of their conversation by Izuku's sudden yelp, and they turned to see him balancing precariously on one leg, the other having been wrenched high into the air for Katsuki to inspect.\n\n\n\"Bakugou, if his leg is hurt you shouldn't pull it like that,\" Aizawa reprimanded, and Katsuki ignored him to poke at parts of Izuku's skin, talking in the most dry, toneless voice the class had ever heard. It even managed to beat out Aizawa.\n\n\n\"Oh my god. How are you still alive. It's a miracle.\" He drawled, as Izuku's face dropped into one of irritation. \"You have a bruise the size of a grape on your knee, this is a true travesty. You'll probably have to go into emergency surgery. How have you suffered in silence for so long.\"\n\n\nIzuku wrestled his leg away and stood up properly again. \"You don't have to be so mean; I said it hurt, not that it was \n\nbroken\n\n or anything.\" He crossed his arms and pouted. Katsuki rolled his eyes.\n\n\n\"You're fucking pathetic.\"\n\n\n\"So you're ok?\" Uraraka checked on her friend.\n\n\n\"Yeah,\" Izuku muttered gloomily, sounding slightly put out. Katsuki snorted.\n\n\n\u201cYou just want my attention, shut up.\u201d\n\n\nIzuku whined, chasing after the blond as he left for the changing rooms.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nThe issue was, although there were a fair amount of sweet, romantic seeming moments between Katsuki and Izuku...\n\n\n...They were still Katsuki and Izuku. The only difference was that now the class got much more concerned for Izuku every time that Katsuki shoved him away, or insulted him, or they got into a physical fight. They fought a \n\nlot,\n\n and it usually didn't take long for their ridiculous spats to turn violent, ending in Izuku being shoved off his seat or pinned to the floor under Katsuki.\n\n\nIt came to a head one evening when while relaxing in the common room, Izuku got bored and began to \n\ninnocently \n\npoke Katsuki's shoulder.\n\n\nThe others barely even took notice, and Katsuki didn't respond to the poking, leading Izuku to get more invested in the action. He sat up and grinned, poking more vigorously until Katsuki finally snapped and grabbed the offending finger, beginning to slowly fold it backwards.\n\n\n\n\"Ow- \n\noh my god- oh my god I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't mean it!\" Izuku rushed out, yelping as the force Katsuki was applying started to hurt.\n\n\n\"Oh, didn't you?\" Katsuki challenged, bending the digit back even further until Izuku was lying down on the couch in pain, before smirking and finally letting go. \"Don't fucking touch me, asshole,\" He declared, turning back to his phone.\n\n\nIzuku laid, holding his finger morosely, before slowly, wincing even before he'd even completed the action, inching his toe over to poke Katsuki's shoulder.\n\n\nThere was a high pitched screech as Katsuki shoved Izuku to the floor, before effortlessly kicking out his legs to slam him into the side of the coffee table, \n\nharshly.\n\n The rest of the group watched, still and tense, as Izuku whimpered on the floor, complaining about the pain and suffering Katsuki had caused him.\n\n\n\"Bakugou, that was \n\nreally \n\nharsh.\" Uraraka said, face creased in worry. Todoroki was the only one that seemed umbothered by the level of violence between the two, nodding his head in almost recognition before turning back to his book.\n\n\n\"Yeah, I don't think Mido deserves that,\" Ashido added quickly, while Izuku continued to writhe around on the ground, clutching his finger and bemoaning quietly.\n\n\n\"He's fucking fine,\" Katsuki scoffed, before reaching out to nudge the boy with his foot again. \"Get the fuck up, you dramatic ass. You asked for that.\"\n\n\nTo the group's surprise, Izuku did just that, muttering spitefully about his finger but calmly settling back down in his seat.\n\n\nThe others didn't really know what to do, sharing unsure glances at each other while Katsuki and Izuku went back to silently scrolling on their phones. It stayed that way until Katsuki went up to bed, when Izuku turned to mutter another 'night, love you'. Katsuku responded in kind before leaving, baffling the class even further.\n\n\n\"Mido,\" Uraraka decided to speak up cautiously. \"Are you and Bakugou... ok?\"\n\n\nIzuku looked confused. \"Uh, yeah? Why?\"\n\n\n\"But like, are \n\nyou\n\n ok with \n\nhim?\"\n\n Uraraka pressed. Izuku squinted slightly before his eyes widened.\n\n\n\"Oh you mean just then? Yeah, that's fine! He's done way worse in the past,\" He laughed off. Uraraka panned another concerned look around the group.\n\n\n\"Midoriya,\" Iida was the one to finally bite the bullet and say it. \"Romantic partners are \n\nnot\n\n supposed to hurt each other.\"\n\n\nKirishima, Kaminari, Asui, and more recently joining their sceptic group, Sero, all exchanged looks, biting their lips in anticipation.\n\n\nIzuku froze, an uncomprehending look in his eye. He took a few seconds to process the words, before a lip quirked up slightly in amusement, and he let his mouth fall open slightly.\n\n\n\"Sorry, \n\nwhat now?\"\n\n\n\nIida opened his mouth, hesitant at Izuku\u2019s clear humoured state. He didn\u2019t get the chance to say anything, however; nobody did. This was because Izuku, the second Iida opened his mouth, burst into the loudest and biggest set of cackles the group had ever heard. They watched him flail about on the couch, clutching his chest and desperately trying to breathe as tears rolled down his face, before Uraraka turned to them, cheeks slightly red.\n\n\n\u201cDo you think we got it wrong?\u201d\n\n\nKirishima and Kaminari gave her pointed looks, eyes widened arrogantly.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou fucking might have,\u201d Kirishima said sarcastically, feeling justice course through him. Him and Asui reached over to blindly high five each other. Izuku fell off the couch, half choking and half wheezing.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just hope he doesn\u2019t tell Bakugou\u2026\u201d\n\nIzuku did, indeed, tell Katsuki. He told him the next morning while Katsuki was eating his breakfast with half of the class in the room, because\u00a0apparently\u00a0Izuku was a very cruel person.\nKatsuki was taking a sip of tea when Izuku told him about the 'romantic partner' line Iida had given him, and the blond snorted into his mug so hard that the liquid splashed up and stained his uniform. He slammed the mug down before he could spill anymore, uncaring of the mess as his hand came up to cover his mouth, abrupt laughter coming out as a loud cackle while Izuku collapsed into another fit of giggles next to him.\nThe rest of them watched the two with flat gazes, both Uraraka and Iida with light pink dusting their cheeks while Izuku and Katsuki seemed to collapse in on each other, Izuku holding onto Katsuki's arm with his whole strength just to stay upright while Katsuki flailed, whacking Izuku repeatedly while the two's laughter transformed into silent wheezes that would reignite the other any time one of them seemed to finally get a hold of themselves.\n\"I can't believe this is the first time we've ever seen Bakugou laugh this hard,\" Ashido said, lips thinned. \"And we can't even enjoy it because he's laughing at\u00a0us.\"\n\"Speak for yourself,\" Kirishima took a sip of his own drink, Kaminari nodding next to him. \"He's laughing at\u00a0you guys.\"\n\"Y-you-,\" Katsuki attempted to get out. \"How\u00a0long-?\"\u00a0He cut himself off with another wheeze, turning to bury his head into Izuku's shoulder as he cried, which really just served to make the class even more confused about the nature of their relationship.\n\"They've been conspiring about it since that safety assembly,\" Kaminari threw them under the bus mercilessly. Uraraka became more red.\n\"Well it didn't make sense!\" She exclaimed wildly, throwing her hands around as she tried to defend herself. \"You just suddenly started acting all affectionate and weird and we couldn't figure out why!\"\n\"What do you mean,\u00a0'suddenly'?\u00a0Me and Kacchan have been the same since we were two years old, there's no suddenly.\" Izuku giggled, a wide grin on his face as he leant his elbow on Katsuki's shoulder.\n\"If you two are friends then why does Bakugou bully you so much, Kero?\" Asui inquired curiously; only for Katsuki to snort.\n\"This nerd is\u00a0not\u00a0my friend,\" He declared confidentially, dislodging Izuku from him and getting up from his chair. \"He's fucking annoying and being around him tires me out.\"\nUraraka made a dramatically confused gesture, glaring after the blond with a frustrated expression as he left the room. They all turned to Izuku for clarification.\nHe shrugged, a wide smile on his face. It did\u00a0not\u00a0clear things up.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe issue was, now that they'd had\u00a0very\u00a0clear confirmation that the two were\u00a0not\u00a0dating, the class was still no closer to figuring out what the fuck was going on between Katsuki and Izuku. They weren't together, but they\u00a0acted\u00a0like more than friends. And yet, Katsuki continuously stated that he didn't even\u00a0like\u00a0Izuku, and they weren't even\u00a0close\u00a0to friends; something that Izuku\u00a0also\u00a0never denied.\nSo, the class was left to watch, in slight despair, as Katsuki and Izuku continued on with their lives as if nothing had happened.\nIt continued like that for a week or two, and now that they had been attuned to the knowledge that Izuku and Katsuki were... somewhat of an unexplainable enigma, the class started paying attention to way more of the pair's interactions, noticing things.\nLike the time Todoroki started passing around the strawberry muffins that his sister had sent him, only for Katsuki to smack Izuku's hand away the second he'd reached for one.\n\"Nope, none for you.\" He decided, even as Izuku whined and Todoroki gave them an odd look.\n\"They were sent for the whole class, Midoriya can have one if he wants.\" Todoroki said, gesturing the tin towards Izuku once more, and the green headed boy smiled at him before quickly reaching in and grabbing one, ducking away with his secured treat as Katsuki tried to snatch it off him.\n\"No-!\u00a0I said no, why the fuck would you give him one?!\" Katsuki glared at Todoroki before turning to threaten Izuku, \"Deku, give the fucking muffin back.\"\n\"But I\u00a0love\u00a0strawberry muffins, Kacchan!\" Izuku whined pathetically, as the rest of those present ping-ponged their heads between the two. \"Just let me have\u00a0one?\"\n\"No! You're not banging down my door in the middle of the night again, crying because you just threw up.\u00a0Not happening.\"\nIzuku pouted, and Katsuki only glared harder, taking a step towards the other as a silent warning.\nIzuku turned his head slightly, a daring look entering his eyes. Katsuki held up a threatening finger, slowly taking another step.\nIzuku put the muffin in his mouth.\nKatsuki pounced.\nThe others watched, slightly amazed, as Katsuki manoeuvred himself so he was holding Izuku to his chest, slapping the muffin out of his hand and to the floor before putting a finger inside each side of Izuku's mouth, holding them there and dragging the desperately fighting boy over to the kitchen sink, like one would their\u00a0dog\u00a0if it was trying to eat something it shouldn't.\n\"Mmf- et-\u00a0ack!\"\u00a0Izuku struggled in the blond's arms, trying to get his head away and failing miserably to remove himself from Katsuki's hold.\nKatsuki, with an impressively impassive face, shoved Izuku's writhing body over until his head was above the sink, using the fingers intruding on the poor boy's mouth to stop him from swallowing the bite of muffin still there. Katsuki then proceeded to scrape the muffin out of his mouth, letting the gross wet clumps of food drop sadly down into the sink while Izuku continued to choke in protest.\nFinally, when it was all out, Izuku accepted defeat, going limp and remaining compliant in Katsuki's hold. Katsuki sighed, looking slightly disgusted as he used his pinkie to turn the tap on, rinsing the rest of his hand under the water before taking the detachable nozzle away and holding it up at Izuku's head height.\n\"Drink.\" He demanded. Looking disappointed in himself, Izuku leant forward just enough to take a mouthful of water, holding it there as Katsuki put the nozzle back.\n\"Swish.\" Katsuki ordered.\nAfter a second, Izuku's cheeks started moving up and down, and he slowly did what he was told.\n\"Spit.\"\nMiserably, Izuku opened his mouth, letting the liquid fall into the sink and down the drain.\nKatsuki clapped him on the shoulder exactly once before shoving him to the side, turning the tap on to clean the sink and scrub his hands more thoroughly.\nIzuku finally made eye-contact with the rest of the room, slumping in on himself when Iida raised an eyebrow at him.\nSadly, eyes on the floor and scuffing his feet, Izuku revealed; \"...I'm allergic to strawberries.\"\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt wasn't just Katsuki that seemed to have more authority over Izuku, but Izuku himself was now noticed to have moments of uncharacteristic bravery regarding Katsuki.\n\"Is that spicy?\" Izuku asked, walking up to where Kirishima, Kaminari, Ashido and Sero were eating lunch with the aggressive blond. He pointed to the onigiri in Katsuki's bento, and the other boy tensed up, stilling his arms protectively and hunching over his food slightly.\n\"No.\"\u00a0He said, not in answer, but in warning. Izuku only grinned wider, leaning over the table slightly to reach for some of the food.\n\"Yes!\"\u00a0Izuku said triumphantly, completely ignoring the murderous glare Katsuki was sending him and ducking through the barrier of limbs to pluck one of the rice balls from the box.\nBased on past actions, the others expected that any second now there would be a thudding sound, a Izuku-style scream of pain, a splatter of blood, and at least three students from other tables that\u00a0weren't\u00a0used to this freaking out and screaming for Recovery Girl. Instead, Katsuki only groaned through his teeth, slumping and continuing to eat the rest of his food with tenacity.\nIzuku stayed by their table, which Kirishima considered to be pushing his luck, and chewed on the rest of the onigiri while Katsuki refused to look at him. It was like a weird staring contest, or battle of wills.\nWould Izuku leave, or would Katsuki finally give him attention?\nAfter about two minutes of awkward silence, Kirishima decided he couldn't handle it anymore and he broke the contest.\n\"Uh, you... need anything else Mido?\" He asked, hesitantly. Katsuki jumped on this, gesturing towards the red head.\n\"Y' see? Shitty-hair wants you to leave, so piss off.\"\n\"Oh, that's not what-\" Kirishima tried to clear up, but both of the Aizawa-dubbed problem children waved him off, ignoring him.\n\"I need your pencil case, I want to use those cool gel pens you have,\" Izuku said, and Katsuki narrowed his eyes incredulously.\n\"Get your own fucking pens!\"\n\"No, yours are better!\" Izuku stomped his foot petulantly. \"Can't you just be happy that I asked this time? Mom said sharing is caring.\"\n\"And guess what? I don't care.\"\n\"Kacchan!\" Izuku whined, before crossing his arms. \"Look, I already took them from your room this morning, I was just being nice by letting you know.\"\nKatsuki sputtered. \"What the\u00a0fuck-\"\u00a0But Izuku just swirled on his feet, skipping back to his friends table. Katsuki glared after him, the others looking at him hesitantly as they waited for him to blow. But to their surprise,\u00a0again,\u00a0he just shook his head slightly, crossing his arms.\n\"Well, now I'm\u00a0definitely\u00a0not returning the headphones he thinks he lost.\"\nKirishima looked at the others, baffled.\n\"If any of us did that,\" Kaminari said quietly, ducking to mumble into Kirishima's ear, \"We'd have to miss class because we'd be in critical condition at the hospital.\"\nKirishima nodded in agreement, Ashido staring at Katsuki sceptically while Sero snickered into his food.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"Midoriya,\" Aizawa interrupted the classes Saturday morning, getting the green-headed boy's attention from where he had been playing a video game with Todoroki and Asui. \"You have a visitor.\"\n\"Oh? Who- oh! Hey mom!\" Izuku perked up as Inko Midoriya entered the common rooms, a warm smile on her face as she waved at them. Aizawa left them to it as Izuku jumped up from the couch to hug Inko, starting to introduce her to the rest of the class.\n\"What are you doing here?\" Izuku asked, once he'd all but ushered her to the couch, making sure she was comfortable. She laughed slightly at his enthusiasm.\n\"I wanted to drop off those clothes you mentioned forgetting,\" Inko answered, patting the bag she'd brought with her, slung over her shoulder. \"And I haven't heard from you in a while, so I thought it would be nice to say hi; see how you were getting on with all your fancy Heroics training.\"\n\"For\u00a0shame,\u00a0Midoriya.\" Uraraka teased, leaning her arms on the back of the couch and grinning. \"You don't call your poor mother?\"\nInko laughed as Izuku sputtered, defending himself. \"I- I do! I've just been really busy, I swear!\"\n\"It's alright,\" Inko soothed, eyes full of mirth. \"I bug Katsuki for enough updates on you, so I wasn't left in the dark or anything.\"\nIzuku rolled his eyes as if this was a completely normal thing to say, while the others exchanged slightly confused glances.\n\"You talk to Bakugou a lot?\" Kaminari was the one that bit the bullet and asked, but before Inko could respond the man of the hour entered the room, heading to the kitchen for breakfast before taking notice of the gathering in the living room and catching sight of their guest.\n\"Oh shit,\" He said casually, surprise flicking over his face before a fond warmth that they'd never seen on Katsuki's face before made an appearance, and he wandered over to them all. \"Hey auntie.\"\nInko gave him a massive smile, standing up so she could give him a quick hug over the back of the couch -which he allowed and even seemed to initiate- before sitting back down. \"Just here to see my boys and drop some stuff off, I've not been here long.\"\n'Auntie?'\u00a0Kirishima mouthed to the rest of the group, a confused expression on his face.\nKatsuki nodded, before nodding his head over to Izuku. \"And I'm guessing this dipshit forgot to offer you a drink?\" Izuku's face dropped in realisation, and Inko covered her mouth to muffle her giggles, reaching out to pat him on the shoulder to curb his panic at the possibility of having been unintentionally rude to his own mother. \"I'll make tea,\" Katsuki snorted, before going over to the kitchen.\n\"Thank you, Katsuki dear. Izuku, while he does that, why don't you show me your room so you can take these off my hands?\" Inko patted the bag slung over her shoulder, and Izuku nodded quickly, jumping up to lead the way.\n\"Ok! My dorm doesn't look much different than my bedroom at home actually, I even managed to find the same posters really cheap online so I didn't have to move any over, and-\" He started rambling as they disappeared down the hall, leaving most of the class to slowly settle back into enjoying their Saturday morning.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen Inko and Izuku emerged back into the common areas, the room had mostly been dispersed as people went about their day, the novelty of having met one of their classmate's parent for the first time having worn off. Uraraka was scrolling through her phone with Asui and Sero looking over her shoulder while most of the others continued to play video games on the TV, and Katsuki sat on the kitchen counter, looking at his own phone while making his way through a large bowl of cereal.\nIzuku led Inko to the kitchen, telling her about the training exercises they'd been doing lately and explaining how cool learning Heroics from actual Pro Heroes was, while Inko listened to him with an amused smile on her face, well used to her sons energetic ways and clearly proud of how far he'd managed to come in regards to living his dream. She picked up the mug of steaming hot tea that Katsuki had left for her, nodding her head over to him in thanks so as to not interrupt Izuku's rant.\n\"-It still hasn't really sunk in, you know? I mean all these Heroes that I grew up begging to go see at conventions and buying merch for, and now I see them in my maths class explaining how to factorise and stuff. And it's so cool having Eraserhead as a homeroom teacher; the way juggles his capture weapon and his quirk is amazing, he's a really good person to learn from.\"\n\"Fifteen years obsessing over not having a quirk,\" Katsuki said idly, not looking up from his phone. \"You finally get one, and immediately start learning from a guy whose whole thing is\u00a0eradicating\u00a0them.\"\nIzuku cut off his rant to send Katsuki a dry glare, unamused, and Inko pressed her lips together to stop herself from laughing.\n\"Don't be mean, Katsuki.\" She said lightly, though humour could be sensed within her tone. Katsuki shrugged, unaffected.\n\"Oh, Mido!\" Asui piped up from their little trio, getting his attention. \"Before we forget, about conventions. They're about to release the tickets to the upcoming national Pro Hero convention, and a bunch of us are gonna go; do you wanna come with?\"\n\"Yeah, of course!\" Izuku exclaimed, head bouncing up and down rapidly as his eyes sparkled.\n\"Only thing is that Aizawa-sensei overheard us talking about it earlier,\" Uraraka looked up at them, frowning slightly, \"He said that Nedzu had asked him to make an announcement later on this week, because they know how many of us are probably going to want to go. Apparently, because of how public the convention is, and how it's usually a target for villain attacks, that due to class 1-A's habit of getting mixed up in that kind of stuff, Aizawa-sensei's got to ask for parental permission to make sure we can go.\"\n\"Aizawa-sensei also has to come with us,\" Sero added, smirking slightly. \"He didn't seem that excited about it.\"\n\"Oh, that's fine,\" Izuku turned to Inko. \"I can go, right?\"\nInko hesitated, and his expression dropped slightly.\n\"Mom, I\u00a0always\u00a0go to the Pro convention!\" He pleaded, when Inko's face didn't change.\n\"I know sweetie, but that was before all this stuff about being targeted by leagues, and villains, and having to fight for your life on a regular basis! And those conventions have always been a bit risky anyway, I'm just not sure if I'm comfortable with you going if that's only going to be\u00a0magnified\u00a0this time around.\" She gave Izuku an apologetic look, and he blanched desperately.\n\"There's\u00a0literally\u00a0going to be a ton of Pro Heroes there! And Aizawa-sensei's going to be going just to keep us safe, we'll be fine!\" He tried to convince, clasping his hands in front of his face.\n\"I'm not sure, Izuku.\" Inko said, still hesitating.\n\"If it helps,\" Uraraka said, weakly, \"All of\u00a0our\u00a0parents are ok with it?\"\n\"Aizawa-sensei's really capable, so there won't be much danger, kero.\" Asui backed up, and Izuku nodded repeatedly. Inko looked at the desperation and hope on their faces, sighing deeply while thinking.\nFinally, she breathed out. \"Alright, if you take Katsuki with you to keep an eye on you, then I'm alright with you going.\"\nThe others paused, looking at each other in confusion. Izuku spun around, looking to Katsuki hopefully and not seeming at\u00a0all\u00a0as if this was an uncommon occurrence for him.\nKatsuki froze, spoonful of cereal in his mouth, phone in one hand, looking up at them through his hair from where he was perched on the side of the kitchen counter.\n\"There's no fucking way I'm going to that thing,\" He declared, speaking around the spoon.\nIzuku slumped, turning back to Inko. \"Oh come on,\u00a0mom,\"\u00a0He pleaded. Inko shook her head firmly.\n\"I'm sorry, Izuku, but unless he agrees to go with you, then I don't want you to go.\"\nSwitching tactics quickly, Izuku turned and rushed to Katsuki's side, bending his knees slightly to shake his clasped hands at him instead. \"Kacchan, Kacchan please-\"\n\"Nope.\"\n\"I'll do your laundry for a month, I'll- I'll-\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Please, I am begging you, I'll buy you whatever merch you want while we'll there, I'll pay for your food,\"\n\"Nuh-uh.\"\n\"I'll do\u00a0anything!\"\nKatsuki wasn't even looking away from his phone. \"I have no interest in going to another Hero convention that's going to be exactly like all the others you've dragged me to in the past. Not happening.\"\n\n\"Please!\"\n\nTodoroki wandered into the kitchen, watching the interaction as he placed his dirty plate into the sink.\n\"I remember begging like that back when I was a kid and was told I had to take Fuyumi with me if I wanted to go to an amusement park, once.\" He hummed, leaning against the wall casually.\nThe others squinted, things suddenly clicking into place for them.\n\"With your- with your\u00a0sibling,\"\u00a0Uraraka repeated, as if she were tasting the word for the first time.\n\"...Huh.\" Asui said, eloquently.\nThere was silence in the room, apart from the quiet background noise of Izuku still attempting to convince Katsuki to come with them to the convention.\n\"You know, come to\u00a0think\u00a0of it-\" Uraraka started, Asui nodding as they both spoke at once.\n\"-Brothers does fit them, yeah.\"\nThey delved back into silence.\n\"Jesus Christ, can you give it a\u00a0rest?\"\u00a0Katsuki groaned, Izuku pressing a palm to his knee and looking up into his eyes eagerly.\n\"Please, please, please, please, I'll pay for everything, and I'll give you back your pens, and I'll never ask for anything from you ever again-\"\n\"Well that's a fucking lie,\" Katsuki interrupted, but Izuku just brushed past him, carrying on.\n\"C'mon, Kacchan, you know how much I love these! Mom will only let me go if you come with me, pleaseeeeeee just come. You won't have to take part in anything! I'll be with the others, so all you'll have to do is follow us around, and you can just ignore us the whole time!\"\nKatsuki let out a loud, irritated, tired sigh, head tilting until he could look Izuku in the eye.\n\"If I say yes, will you shut the fuck up and leave me in peace?\"\nIzuku started bouncing up and down on the spot, nodding fervently as he waited in anticipation.\nKatsuki rolled his eyes.\n\"For fucks sake-\u00a0you're\u00a0paying, alright?\"\nIzuku seemed to\u00a0explode\u00a0with happiness, rushing forward to overload the blond with gratitude and thank yous before turning and hurrying over to Inko, who had been watching the entire display with thinly veiled fond exasperation. \"So I can go, right? You'll give Aizawa-sensei permission for me?\"\nInko chuckled, making eye contact with Katsuki, who gave her an acquiescing nod, before she smiled. \"Yes, I'll give you permission.\"\nIzuku whooped, reaching over to give Uraraka a high-five. She returned it, slightly dazed.\n\"This is only because I'm her favourite child,\" Katsuki smirked, jumping off the counter smoothly.\nIzuku pouted dramatically, and Inko laughed. \"Now, now, boys. You know I love\u00a0both\u00a0my sons\u00a0equally.\u00a0Be nice to each other, ok? And Izuku, be careful during those Heroics classes; you know Katsuki will tell me if you get hurt too much, alright?\"\n\"Kacchan gets hurt too! You just don't baby him as much as me because he's a few months older, it's ridiculous.\" Izuku whined, mumbling more quietly under his breath,\u00a0\"Snitch.\"\n\"I think it's more because I don't cry at Christmas adverts on TV,\" Katsuki responded, walking over to stand next to him and elbowing him in the side.\u00a0\"Keep it up and you can say 'goodbye convention',\"\u00a0He warned out the side of his mouth, even as he gave Inko a bright smile. Izuku jolted to attention.\n\"You win!\" He assured, before stepping forward to say goodbye to his mother, beginning to lead her out of the dorms. Katsuki went with them, leaving the rest of them alone to stew in their realisations.\nUraraka turned to Asui. \"We might be really fucking stupid.\"\n\"Yeah, we might be.\""
