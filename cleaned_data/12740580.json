    "text": "Tony visited his Aunt Peg every Sunday.\nHe usually brought a book with him because often she didn\u2019t notice he was there and she rambled on. Most of what she rambled about were incidents in her past. Tony had learned all about Whitney Frost that way. And Jason Wilkes. Tony kind of wished he\u2019d gotten the chance to meet him. Other times, she was more introspective.\n\u2018I know it was the right thing to do,\u2019 she was currently saying. \u2018But I do feel bad for Tony.\u2019\nAnd apparently completely unaware he was the one sitting here. \u2018Why?\u2019\n\u2018Well, I made him hate his father for no reason.\u2019 That statement made Tony freeze. \u2018I know they already had a bad relationship. If I could have covered it up another way without lying to Tony, I would have. Unfortunately, the most believable lie was that Howard was drunk.\u2019\nHer words came back to him. \u2018I\u2019m sorry, Tony. He got behind the wheel, drunk. He crashed the car and killed both of them.\u2019\nWas he now hearing that she\u2019d lied to him that day? Tony forced his voice to remain composed. \u2018What happened?\u2019\n\u2018Oh, there was somebody else involved.\u2019 She nodded her head, somewhat dismissively. \u2018Whoever it was, he shot the tyres out of their car. That\u2019s why they crashed. I looked at the bodies. The assassin bashed Howard\u2019s face in \u2013 his skull was completely caved in. Maria was strangled. That\u2019s why we nailed the coffins shut for the funeral. It was a pity we had to lie to Tony.\u2019\n\u2018Why did you lie to Tony?\u2019 This time there was a distinct shake in Tony\u2019s voice.\nPeg didn\u2019t notice. \u2018If it was known that they were murdered, there\u2019d be an enquiry. Why were they killed? I couldn\u2019t have anyone finding out about S.H.I.E.L.D., now, could I? I especially couldn\u2019t risk Tony finding out where a chunk of his fortune goes and withdrawing it. We needed the money.\u2019\nTony slapped his book shut. \u2018I have to get back to work.\u2019 He couldn\u2019t stand to be in the room with this woman a moment longer.\n\u2018Well, thank you for visiting.\u2019\n\u2018No problem.\u2019 Tony bolted out of the room.\n***\nThere were two engineer modes on Tony Stark: procrastination and \u201csomething-terrible-just-happened-and-this-is-the-only-way-I-know-how-to-handle-it\u201d. The first one had Tony coming out of his workshop to see Rhodey, go party, or look for a flavour of the night.\nThis was the second one.\nPepper strode into the mansion and headed straight for the workshop. \u2018JARVIS?\u2019\n\u2018Yes, Miss Potts?\u2019\n\u2018Has Mr. Stark been down in the workshop since Sunday?\u2019\n\u2018He hasn\u2019t left at all.\u2019\n\u2018But he wants me to come down?\u2019\n\u2018He has discovered something quite\u2026distressing, Miss Potts. It requires urgent attention. I recommend we be prepared to make one phone call to the FBI, one to the CIA, and one to Lt. Col. Rhodes.\u2019\nWith a frown, Pepper headed down to the workshop. What could be so awful that the two major intelligence agencies of the world would need to be notified? Rhodey, it was obvious. He was Tony\u2019s best friend so he\u2019d need to be called for moral support. Pepper descended the stairs and looked through the glass into the workshop. Tony was sitting at his workstation, glaring at the monitors.\nPepper keyed in the access code and stepped in. \u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019\nTony looked up at her. \u2018I won\u2019t be visiting Peggy Carter anymore.\u2019\nOh. She\u2019d died? That must\u2019ve been why Tony locked himself down here for three days. Rhodey had said he\u2019d been despondent for ages after his parents died, and then angry. The original Jarvis had apparently dealt with all the arrangements. \u2018Who\u2019s taking care of the funeral?\u2019\n\u2018She\u2019s not dead.\u2019\nThat pulled Pepper up short. \u2018Then why aren\u2019t you seeing her again? I thought she was the only family you had left.\u2019\n\u2018So did I.\u2019 That was a tone she\u2019d never heard from Tony before. Tense, with a trace of hurt running through it.\n\u2018Tony, she has Alzheimer\u2019s,\u2019 Pepper said. \u2018What could she have possibly done that was so horrible you\u2019re cutting contact with her?\u2019\nTony quirked a finger at her, indicating she should come over to him. Pepper walked around the work desk and to Tony\u2019s shoulder. Tony then folded his arms and nodded to the screens. Pepper looked at them. The first thing she noticed was that Tony had hacked into some website with a falcon silhouette insignia and S.H.I.E.L.D. stamped across the centre of it. Underneath, the acronym was extended: Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement, and Logistics Division. The data Tony had pulled up made Pepper freeze in shock.\n\u2018Oh, my God\u2026\u2019\nTony had a very good reason to be pissed off.\n\u2018Hm. Do you know dad funded them?\u2019 Tony inclined his head. \u2018They\u2019re still using my money. Why don\u2019t we contact the legal team and find out if they can actually do that?\u2019\nPepper nodded and pulled out her Blackberry.\n***\nThe door was answered by Tony Stark\u2019s redheaded PA, Pepper Potts. She led them into the house and into the living room where she picked up the evidence, which had been stacked into manila folders. The two flicked them open and started rifling through them. There was even a USB stick, which was sure to be stacked with even more evidence.\n\u2018This is all of it?\u2019 CIA Agent Harper asked.\n\u2018Yes, sir,\u2019 Pepper said.\nFBI Agent Shawn nodded and flicked his folder closed. \u2018We\u2019d like to talk to Mr. Stark as well.\u2019\nMiss Potts nodded. \u2018This way, gentlemen.\u2019 She led them through the mansion and into a large gym located in the back room. There was a large boxing ring set up in the middle of the room. That was where the billionaire was. Tony Stark had a couple of bandages wrapped around his hands as he beat the living daylights out of a boxing bag that was being held steady by a larger middle-aged man.\nOf course, in his situation anybody would be angry \u2013 far better it be to take it out on an object designed to be punched.\nThere was another man there, in military uniform \u2013 an African American. Lt. Col. James Rhodes if they weren\u2019t mistaken. He was sitting back and watching this with a severe look on his face. He turned his head as they walked in and stood up. Then he called, \u2018Hey, Tones.\u2019\nStark stopped and turned around. He looked at them, took a deep, and then came over to the barrier of the ring. \u2018I guess you two want to know how I found out.\u2019\n\u2018That is our main concern, yes,\u2019 Agent Harper said.\n\u2018The simple answer is: from Aunt Peg.\u2019\n\u2018Aunt Peg?\u2019\n\u2018Not my real aunt,\u2019 Tony said. \u2018But I\u2019ve known Peggy Carter all my life.\u2019\nPeggy Carter, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. at its inception until she was forced into retirement. Agent Harper frowned. \u2018You\u2019re saying your parents were involved with S.H.I.E.L.D.\u2019\n\u2018Dad, mostly, it turns out.\u2019 Tony hopped down from the ring. \u2018He became friends with Peg in World War II. When she turned the SSR into S.H.I.E.L.D. it was with dad\u2019s money. Looks like she took advantage of dad\u2019s ignorance of how intelligence agencies are supposed to work, which is how S.H.I.E.L.D. can now operate the way it does. It was all on dad\u2019s dime.\u2019\nHarper and Shawn looked at each other. S.H.I.E.L.D. had existed since the 1950s, and it had always left a bitter taste in the mouth. The rest of the intelligence community had hated them, not because they were better \u2013 they weren\u2019t. It was because while everyone else was in the public eye, and subject to scrutiny, S.H.I.E.L.D. had operated in the shadows \u2013 unseen and unmonitored \u2013 and could do whatever they damn well liked. Now it looked like Director Carter, who always been considered somewhat arrogant, had gotten into this position by manipulating her friendship with a millionaire.\nTony went on. \u2018And they thanked him by covering up his and mom\u2019s double murder.\u2019\n\u2018And Carter just told you this?\u2019 Agent Shawn asked. \u2018After lying for years?\u2019\n\u2018To be fair, she didn\u2019t realise it was me she was talking to.\u2019\nAgent Harper paused. \u2018Doesn\u2019t Carter have Alzheimer\u2019s?\u2019\n\u2018Which is why I was dubious about what she said at first,\u2019 Tony said. \u2018I considered she might have just been rambling nonsense. But, on the other hand, she could not have been. So I picked up on the organisation she mentioned and I went looking for solid evidence.\u2019 Tony nodded to the folders. \u2018That\u2019s what those are.\u2019\n\u2018Did Ms. Carter give you any indication of her reasons, Mr. Stark?\u2019 Agent Shawn asked.\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 Tony said. \u2018Her first reason was that she didn\u2019t want it investigated and led back to S.H.I.E.L.D.\u2019\nBoth federal agents nodded and rolled their eyes.\nTony went on. \u2018The second reason was that she didn\u2019t want to risk me pulling Stark Industries\u2019 funding from the S.H.I.E.L.D. coffers.\u2019\nAgent Harper nodded. \u2018May I then recommend you hold out on that until we have a solid case against them and we can charge them?\u2019\nTony just nodded.\n\u2018Anything further to add, Mr. Stark?\u2019\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 Tony said. \u2018There were three people who claimed to have seen dad crash the car, including my EO. Not a single one of their testimonies measure up to that.\u2019 He pointed to the folders. \u2018I want an explanation.\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019ve spoken to your EO?\u2019 Agent Harper asked.\n\u2018He just reiterated his old story.\u2019 Tony shook his head. \u2018I know it\u2019s not true, though. I want answers \u2013 the real ones.\u2019\n***\nRhodey sat in the Stark Mansion living room with Tony, Pepper, and Happy. He\u2019d been pretty pissed off when he\u2019d heard. It was even worse to arrive back here and find it was true. What kind of friend was Peggy Carter? You didn\u2019t cover up your friend\u2019s murder, lie to his 17 year old son, and then claim it was for the greater good.\nThen, this was just the icing on top of the cake!\n\u2018You know that stuff technically belongs to you, right?\u2019 Rhodey asked.\n\u2018Yes, it does, platypus,\u2019 Tony said. \u2018And I\u2019ll be suing for their return.\u2019 He turned to Pepper. \u2018Add that on the list of things for Legal to do once the report comes out, Pep.\u2019\nPepper was typing furiously on her Blackberry. \u2018Already done.\u2019\n\u2018Good.\u2019 Tony clicked and the holographic screen appeared in front of them.\n\u2018What\u2019s this?\u2019 Happy asked.\n\u2018Well, the CIA and FBI apparently don\u2019t like S.H.I.E.L.D., as well as every other intelligence agency in the world.\u2019 Tony smirked. \u2018The reason for that is because while they are all subject to scrutiny, S.H.I.E.L.D. can go around doing whatever they like with no consequence because nobody knows they\u2019re there. The rest of the intelligence community is quite looking forward to sticking them in the public eye like this.\u2019\n\u2018As they would be,\u2019 Rhodey said.\n\u2018I know, right?\u2019 Tony chuckled. He sobered up. \u2018Anyway, but because they\u2019re accustomed to completely ignoring the law, both the CIA and FBI are expecting that once this starts, they\u2019ll try to weasel their way out. These are the agents they think Peg\u2019s successor, Nick Fury, is going to send after me.\u2019\nPepper leaned over and picked one of the folders up. \u2018Phillip Coulson. Displays clear signs of sociopathy \u2013 actual diagnosis unconfirmed.\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019ll find a lot of them are like that,\u2019 Tony said. \u2018Their actions, methods, and behaviours have led every other intelligence agency in the world to consider them potential sociopaths or psychopaths. Either way, they all have aspects of antisocial personality disorder.\u2019 He tapped the pile. \u2018I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re trained that way or if they\u2019re picked out for those traits.\u2019\n\u2018They\u2019re probably picked out for them,\u2019 Rhodey said. \u2018You know, you can lead a horse to water\u2026\u2019\nTony nodded. He rifled through the folders and picked out one. \u2018This is the one they actually want me to worry about. He flicked it open.\n\u2018Natasha Romanoff?\u2019 Happy asked. \u2018Sounds Russian.\u2019\n\u2018It is Russian,\u2019 Tony said. \u2018She was originally part of a top secret Russian spy program called the Red Room and is the current Black Widow. Turns out from 1946 until he was engaged to my mom, the Black Widows went after dad a lot. There were no less than five sent after him.\u2019\n\u2018So they\u2019ll probably send this one after you,\u2019 Pepper guessed, getting a good look at her profile.\nTony nodded. \u2018Apparently, they\u2019re not too good at using their creative juices. S.H.I.E.L.D. have a grand total of three tricks: manipulation, seduction, and violence. That\u2019s it.\u2019 Tony shook his head. \u2018Hell, by the time the last one came around, dad had taught himself to recognise the Black Widows.\u2019 A statement appeared on the screens in front of them. \u2018Look at this. Dad actually got so mad about it that he gave a statement to somebody. I\u2019m not sure who, though. Would\u2019ve had to be somebody outside of S.H.I.E.L.D. or we wouldn\u2019t have it.\u2019\nYou can always tell, the quote read. They saunter up to you, skirt hitched up, at least an inch of cleavage showing, glossy lips, flicking their hair, batting their eyelashes and getting well within your personal space. If they do play \u201chard to get\u201d, then the key to it will generally be you showing them what they want to steal. And whatever they\u2019re wearing you can bet it\u2019s gonna both be form-fitting and push their jugs out.\n\u2018Really?\u2019 Rhodey asked. That was the oldest trick in the book! \u2018They still do this?\u2019\n\u2018I checked,\u2019 Tony said. \u2018Romanoff certainly does.\u2019\n\u2018Hm.\u2019 Rhodey shook his head. \u2018No creativity. So we\u2019re expecting some attacks when this all goes to hell?\u2019\n\u2018Yup.\u2019 Tony reached under the coffee table. \u2018Seeing as the report\u2019s going to be released tomorrow, I made these. They\u2019re linked to JARVIS and there\u2019s one for each of us.\u2019 Tony opened the box and handed out the wristwatches inside.\n\u2018What do they do, besides the obvious?\u2019 Pepper asked.\n\u2018They beep if a registered S.H.I.E.L.D. agent comes within range,\u2019 Tony said. \u2018And I know for a fact that all of their agents are registered. They also send out a pulse if they move towards you in any kind of violent manner. The pulse will blow the agent across the room. If there\u2019s a second attack, they get electrocuted.\u2019\nRhodey chuckled and clipped his on. \u2018Nice.\u2019\nA classification screen appeared on the TV. A male voice spoke over the top of it. \u2018The following program contains images that will be distressing to some viewers. Viewer discretion is advised.\u2019\nThe news station\u2019s theme music sounded and a studio was shown with an attractive middle-aged woman sitting at the news desk. \u2018Good afternoon, I\u2019m Sandra Cablet, and welcome to this half-hour special investigation report on the deaths of Howard and Maria Stark. While it is true that the Starks were known to have died in a car accident eighteen years ago, new evidence has come to light which we will now explore.\u2019\nAn image of a darkened street appeared behind her.\n\u2018To begin with, we will observe this video tape, procured by a joint FBI and CIA investigation into the allegations.\u2019\nAnd the entire world watched, starting with the United States of America, as the crime was finally exposed. They watched as an unidentified motorcyclist shot the tyres out of the Starks\u2019 Lincoln, causing it to crash, and then bashed Howard Stark\u2019s face in, despite him begging for his wife to be helped, and they watched as Maria Stark was strangled. It escaped no one\u2019s notice that Howard Stark had recognised his killer.\nThe scene returned to the reporter. \u2018As you can see, it seems that the popular theory that Howard Stark was drunk behind the wheel was, in fact, an elaborate cover-up. Howard and Maria Stark were murdered in cold blood.\u2019 She paused. \u2018As Maria Stark was strangled, the only evidence would have been on her flesh. With Tony Stark\u2019s permission, however, Howard Stark\u2019s body was exhumed and examined by the forensic team of the FBI. We were able to interview the head forensic pathologist a few days ago.\u2019\nThe scene changed to the interviewer speaking to a man of about 64 or 65.\n\u2018Thank you for agreeing to speak with me, Dr. Borren.\u2019\n\u2018Thank you for having me, Mrs. Cablet,\u2019 he said.\n\u2018You examined Howard Stark\u2019s skeleton before it was returned to ground?\u2019 the interviewer asked. \u2018What did you find?\u2019\n\u2018Howard Stark\u2019s skull had been reconstructed before he was buried, especially around the nasal cavity,\u2019 Dr. Borren said. \u2018If Mr. Stark had indeed crashed, the only thing he could have smacked his head on was the steering wheel. The broken bones in his face, however, are not the kind that would result from a high-speed impact of the face to the steering wheel. Instead, the acquired video shows a much more accurate picture of what occurred. Any coroner should have seen that he had been intentionally bashed in the face by another person.\u2019\n\u2018Why do you think they didn\u2019t?\u2019\n\u2018The most likely reason was that the coroner was paid off.\u2019\nThe scene flicked back to the studio where the news reporter sat at her desk. \u2018The joint investigation has, thus far, been able to learn that the Starks were killed due to Howard Stark\u2019s involvement with an organisation that, until now, has been completely hidden from the public: Strategic Homeland Enforcement, Intervention, and Logistics Division, otherwise known as S.H.I.E.L.D. They were formed in 1953 from the Strategic Scientific Reserve \u2013 the SSR \u2013 which was founded specifically for World War Two. In the post-war era, the SSR found themselves becoming increasingly redundant. At this time, the famous Peggy Carter was an agent who decided to reform it into something new. She did so by seizing on her friendship with Howard Stark and she used his money.\u2019 She paused and glanced down at her notes. \u2018While Howard Stark was claimed to be a founding member and one of the leaders of S.H.I.E.L.D. all evidence gathered by the CIA indicates that he had no real power or authority in the organisation. He was not informed of any missions and seemed to spend most of the time either giving the agents money or transport or working in the science labs. It would appear that, to them, he was essentially a \u201ccash cow\u201d. After the break, we\u2019ll explore the reasons why S.H.I.E.L.D. and Peggy Carter decided to pass off the double murder of Howard and Maria Stark as an accident.\u2019\n***\nTony looked over as the commercials started. \u2018Now.\u2019\nPepper nodded and hit the button which gave Legal the signal to begin procedures.\nThe first thing to go would be SI funding.\n***\n\u2018Okay, let\u2019s talk about intelligence agencies,\u2019 Conan O\u2019Brien said. \u2018Generally, they\u2019re pretty good to have around. They take care of national security, hunt down terrorists, and basically take care of the big things the police aren\u2019t equipped to handle. Yup! Intelligence agencies are all about protecting the people\u2026Then you\u2019ve got S.H.I.E.L.D.\u2019\nThere were chuckles in the audience.\n\u2018Let\u2019s take a look at what S.H.I.E.L.D.\u2019s done since its inception.\u2019 Conan started counting off on his fingers. \u2018Peggy Carter lied to her friend, Bank-Account\u2014I mean Howard Stark, and used his money to create an organisation that no one knew about.\u2019 He leaned back and sighed wistfully. \u2018Must\u2019ve been great. No one was watching, so these guys could do whatever they wanted. I had that kind of power, I\u2019d go more for pizza. They decided to ignore every law under the sun, but to each their own, you know.\u2019 He paused and shuffled the papers on his desk. When he spoke again, his voice was casual. \u2018But you\u2019d think they\u2019d realise concealing a double murder is going too far.\u2019\n***\n\u2018How the fuck did they get that tape before we did?\u2019 Fury demanded as he stormed into his office.\nMaria Hill and Phillip Coulson followed him.\n\u2018No idea, sir,\u2019 Hill said, \u2018but we do know it wasn\u2019t doctored.\u2019\nFury only managed to keep himself from growling from his years of discipline. His cell phone beeped again but he ignored it. Now that they knew S.H.I.E.L.D. existed, the world was calling for them to come forth. Why had they hidden? What were they afraid of? What did they have to say for themselves? It was a waste of his time. He could see why Carter didn\u2019t want them in the public eye.\n\u2018Where did the leak come from then?\u2019 Fury demanded.\n\u2018We don\u2019t know yet,\u2019 Coulson said. \u2018But we do have an additional problem.\u2019\n\u2018What\u2019s that?\u2019\n\u2018Stark Industries is suing us.\u2019 Coulson pulled out his clipboard and flipped it open. \u2018They also apparently found out they were funding us. They\u2019ve withdrawn their funding about half-way through the initial news report and now they\u2019re suing us in a civil court for the return of Howard Stark\u2019s inventions and research \u2013 you know, that stuff we took after he died. Apparently Tony Stark found out we have it, and he thinks it belongs to him.\u2019\nWell\u2026if you wanted to be technical it did. That was why Howard\u2019s will did a Houdini. They only thing they hadn\u2019t taken was Howard\u2019s home computer, but there\u2019d be nothing of interest on that which they didn\u2019t have. Fury scoffed. \u2018He can try all he likes he ain\u2019t gettin\u2019 shit. We\u2019ll send Romanoff at him. Black Widows had a lot of success on Howard when he was Tony\u2019s age.\u2019\n***\n\u2018There are a lot of people who cast doubt on Tony Stark,\u2019 Dr. Phil said to his audience. \u2018The reason for this is because he went looking for the information based on the ramblings of a woman with Alzheimer\u2019s. The argument is that she was a delusional old woman and nothing she said should be taken seriously.\u2019\nHe pointed directly at the recording camera.\n\u2018Well, I am here to tell you that is wrong! Alzheimer\u2019s isn\u2019t a disease of delusion. It\u2019s a disease of degeneration. The brain is breaking down in the skull. The victims of Alzheimer\u2019s are not having delusions. Their minds are not creating memories. In fact, quite the contrary. As the disease progresses, they\u2019re losing memories. If an Alzheimer\u2019s patient admits to a crime, it can\u2019t be brushed aside. It needs to be taken seriously. That is exactly what Tony Stark did.\u2019\n***\nTony sat at his work desk watching the newsfeed. One in particular drew his attention. There were people all over the world going to their nearest Stark Industries building to lay down flowers. Everywhere was absolutely carpeted with them. Tony didn\u2019t recall people caring this much when they\u2019d actually died.\nThe door to the workshop opened and Tony looked up to see Pepper walk in.\nTony smiled. \u2018You look tired.\u2019\n\u2018We\u2019ve been carting flowers in all day,\u2019 Pepper said. \u2018Oh, and they took Obadiah into custody today.\u2019\n\u2018Hm.\u2019 Tony glared at the screens. \u2018Go quietly, did he?\u2019\n\u2018Nope. They had to taser him.\u2019 Pepper frowned. \u2018I had no idea he was so violent.\u2019\n\u2018Yeah,\u2019 Tony said. \u2018FBI sent me a personality profile on him just ten minutes ago. Look.\u2019 He clicked and the profile appeared.\nPepper read it and drew back in surprise. \u2018So he\u2019s a confirmed psychopath?\u2019\n\u2018Yeah. Get a few people to search his office for me.\u2019 Tony narrowed his eyes. \u2018Preferably people who found him unsettling.\u2019\n\u2018Sure.\u2019 Pepper pulled out her Blackberry and began typing. \u2018How are you holding up?\u2019\n\u2018About how you\u2019d expect.\u2019 Tony leaned on the desk. \u2018I\u2019ve been thinking.\u2019\n\u2018About\u2026?\u2019\n\u2018Dad, mostly.\u2019 Tony sighed and sat down. \u2018We used to clash an awful lot. He wasn\u2019t around most of the time and I translated that into him not wanting to spend time with me. I was a kid when he died. I had no idea about S.H.I.E.L.D. and I just found out why too.\u2019\n\u2018Yeah?\u2019\n\u2018Dad didn\u2019t want me anywhere near them.\u2019 Tony\u2019s lips tugged upwards at the thought of it. \u2018He actually had an ultimatum with Peg, cause apparently she wanted to enlist me since I was four.\u2019\n\u2018Four?\u2019 Pepper demanded.\n\u2018Apparently, building a circuit board at that age makes you great killer-assassin material.\u2019 Tony shrugged, trying to appear unconcerned. Really, it had terrified him when he\u2019d found that tidbit. To think, he\u2019d actually felt safe around that woman! \u2018Dad told her if S.H.I.E.L.D. went within ten feet of me, he\u2019d yank the funding.\u2019\n\u2018\u2026So your dad was protecting you all that time.\u2019\n\u2018Yeah. It\u2019s really made me re-evaluate him.\u2019 He closed his eyes. \u2018I wonder what he was like away from my childhood perception of him. Now, because of them, I\u2019ll never know.\u2019\nPepper reached out and rubbed his back in a gesture of comfort. Tony smiled gratefully at her. She was the only woman he\u2019d ever met, aside from his mother, who he respected. She was the first girl who hadn\u2019t been interested in his fortune at all. Her, Happy, and Rhodey were all the friends he\u2019d ever need in the world. For a few minutes they stood like that.\n\u2018Oh, right, before I forget.\u2019 Tony clapped and flicked a new screen up. \u2018Look whose decided to grace us with her presence.\u2019\nPepper looked. \u2018Natalie Rushman? Really?\u2019\n\u2018Yeah. Apparently this is normal. I looked up the Black Widows they sent after dad. Dottie Underwood was really Darya Utkin. Sarah Peterson was really Sonya Petrov. Yvette Spooner was really Yulia Sokolovsky. You get the idea.\u2019\n\u2018No creativity,\u2019 Pepper muttered. She looked up at him. \u2018So what\u2019s your plan?\u2019\n\u2018Let\u2019s weave the web around the spider.\u2019\nObadiah sat in the interrogation room, staring at the door.\nHis hands were handcuffed together, but he was confident he could manipulate his way out of this. The charge was something to do with bearing false witness. All he had to do was come across as a totally honest and compliant man. Besides, he had Tony Stark on his side. He\u2019d made sure to be close enough to Tony that the boy would pay him out of any trouble he might be in.\nThe door to the interrogation room opened. Obadiah affected a startled look. Inside, though, he was hissing with glee as Tony entered the room followed by Pepper Potts and two security guards. This was it. The cuffs would be off shortly and he could go on as usual.\nObadiah was surprised, though, when Tony spun the other chair around, propped one foot on it and leaned an arm on his knee. \u2018Hello, Obie.\u2019\n\u2018Tony,\u2019 Obadiah gave him a nervous smile, \u2018I\u2019m sure you\u2019d like an explanation for this.\u2019 He lifted his cuffed hands. He had one lined up too. \u2018You see, they think\u2026\u2019\n\u2018I know exactly what they think,\u2019 Tony said in a tone Obadiah had never heard from him. Howard, yes, but never Tony. \u2018We had a nice little chat.\u2019 He paused. \u2018A few nice little chats, actually. There\u2019s just one question I\u2019d like to ask, Obie. Why did you lie?\u2019\nShit. Obadiah put his most convincing earnest expression on. \u2018I didn\u2019t lie, Tony. I\u2019d never lie to you.\u2019\nPepper arched one eyebrow at him.\n\u2018Mm-hm.\u2019 Tony looked up at the security camera and nodded. \u2018Then explain this.\u2019\nThere was a TV mounted to the wall above them and it flicked on. A tape began playing and, as he realised what it was, Obadiah felt the first etchings of doubt beginning to creep in. What the hell were those damn idiots thinking recording that?! His mind raced as he tried to think of a way out of this. \u2018Tony, I had no idea!\u2019\n\u2018Really?\u2019 Tony asked doubtfully. He held his hand out and Pepper handed him an old newspaper. Tony opened it and set it down in front of Obadiah. \u2018So this isn\u2019t you claiming to have seen the accident?\u2019 He pointed to the line where Obadiah\u2019s quote had been written. \u2018This isn\u2019t you claiming that the car spun out of control before anyone knew what was happening?\u2019\nOh\u2026shit. How was he going to talk his way out of this one? If he had more time he could think of some explanation, but he\u2019d had no time. He was just suddenly in a spot he hadn\u2019t anticipated. Of course, if those damn fools hadn\u2019t gone and recorded the assassination this wouldn\u2019t have happened.\nTony shoved the chair aside and leaned on the table. \u2018You weren\u2019t there, Obie. You lied. And I want to know why.\u2019\nObadiah said nothing. There was nothing he could say that would make him look better. He just affected the most shocked look he could. That ought to do it. Pepper laid a hand on Tony\u2019s shoulder. He took a deep breath. Times like this Obadiah considered that Pepper was to Tony what Maria had been to Howard.\n\u2018Never mind,\u2019 Tony said. \u2018I know why.\u2019 He took the clipboard that Pepper handed to him. \u2018See, after you were arrested we went through your office.\u2019\n\n\u2026Not good.\n\n\u2018Seems you\u2019ve been selling off our defective and out-of-date stock to the highest bidder.\u2019 Tony fixed him with a hard glare. \u2018You know, the stuff that should have been stripped down and put back into the production line. You\u2019ve been doing it for years. And that\u2019s the thing, isn\u2019t it? Dad, who built the company up from the ground without your help, had begun to get suspicious. So when HYDRA approached you, wanting something from dad, you made a deal with them to assassinate dad.\u2019\nObadiah stared Tony down. \u2018You have no evidence.\u2019\n\u2018Actually, I do,\u2019 Tony said. \u2018Or rather, the CIA does. Seems HYDRA were so full of themselves they recorded everything \u2013 including that conversation. It was found in the same place the assassination video was \u2013 the neglected HYDRA archives in Ukraine.\u2019 Tony\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u2018You wanted dad dead. Mom was just collateral damage. It also made it easier for you to use me. You know what you\u2019re gonna do now?\u2019\nTony didn\u2019t give him a chance to answer.\n\u2018You\u2019re going to tell these nice federal agents who the killer was and who you were talking to in that conversation.\u2019\nEnraged, Obadiah lunged at Tony, aiming to grab his throat. This wasn\u2019t supposed to happen! He wasn\u2019t supposed to get caught red-handed! The guards suddenly shot forward as Tony stepped back and Obadiah had two guns in his face. He glared at Tony as the boy cast him one withering look as he led Pepper out of the interrogation room.\n***\nFury strode into the room, leading several of his S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents in. The CIA and FBI had organised a meeting. The damn fools had left themselves wide open. It was something to do with their concealing a double murder. It didn\u2019t matter to Fury. He\u2019d deal with these insolent bastards first, and then he\u2019d deal with Stark.\nAfter all, the kid was just an immature playboy throwing a temper tantrum.\nStark was nothing to them.\nSure, the publicity would be hard to get away from, but this was S.H.I.E.L.D. First, he\u2019d deal with these idiots \u2013 permanently if need be \u2013 and then he\u2019d put Stark in his place. He\u2019d known that Carter rambled on, but to think she\u2019d actually rambled on at Tony about the one thing he should never have known. Maybe she needed to be moved to a more secure location.\nFury stepped into the room, and froze. The two men, respectively the Directors of the CIA and FBI, sat at a table on a podium directly in front of them. Surrounding the podium was a set-up like a press conference. The room was full of reporters and photographers.\nDirector Coombes of the FBI stood up. \u2018Director Fury, I trust you\u2019ll forgive the audience. Mr. Stark suggested, for fair procedures, that the Press might be beneficial to have in the room with us. If you\u2019ll take your seat, we might begin.\u2019\nThe Press also made it impossible to overpower them.\nFucking Stark!\n***\nNatasha followed Potts down into the Stark Mansion. It had been frustrating, but she\u2019d finally managed to get in. She\u2019d get into Stark\u2019s system and get his funds back into S.H.I.E.L.D. where they belonged. All she had to do was get his trust, and that wouldn\u2019t be too hard.\nThe first step, it turned out, was easier than she\u2019d been expecting. All she had to do was slip one of her \u201csuperiors\u201d a little pill that made her violently sick when she was supposed to go to an important meeting. Natasha had then filled in. With that, she was handed some paperwork and sent to Stark Mansion.\nToo easy.\nThey walked into a room where Tony Stark was leaning over a computer. Potts stepped forward. \u2018Miss Rushman, Mr. Stark.\u2019\nTony Stark turned around. \u2018Ah.\u2019 He gave her a wide smile and looked her over. His eyes lingered on her legs and then her cleavage. Easy.\n\u2018Good morning, Mr. Stark.\u2019 Natasha stepped right into his personal space and handed him the paperwork. \u2018I\u2019ve been sent to deliver this.\u2019 She made sure to bat her eyelashes and brush his hand as she handed the paper to him.\nStark chuckled and moved back, leaning against the desk. He slid the envelope open and read what she\u2019d handed to him. Natasha hadn\u2019t bothered slipping it open to have a read herself. It\u2019s not like what was in there was important to her. When Stark looked up, she made sure to flick her hair.\n\u2018Hm.\u2019 Stark smiled pleasantly as he set the paperwork down. \u2018Rushman, huh? Got a first name that goes with that?\u2019\nNatasha affected surprise. \u2018Uh\u2026Natalie.\u2019\n\u2018Natalie Rushman,\u2019 Stark mused. \u2018Tell me something, Natalie Rushman. Do you recognise any of these people?\u2019 He clapped and five holographic screens appeared behind him. That was some impressive tech. S.H.I.E.L.D. would benefit from it. She might have to coerce it out of him. Then Natasha looked at the faces on the screens.\nFor the first time, she began to worry. \u2018I\u2019m afraid not, Mr. Stark.\u2019\nActually, she did. All five women had been previous Black Widows. They spanned from 1946 until 1957. And those ones specifically had, at some stage, been sent after Howard Stark. The last one Yvette Spooner, or Yulia Sokolovsky, had been the only one to be unsuccessful because Howard Stark had suddenly been spoken for and turned out to be entirely faithful to Maria Collins Carbonell.\nShe\u2019d also been the only one whose career was ended by a civilian.\n\u2018Hm-mm.\u2019 Stark picked up the paperwork and flicked it open. \u2018You sat in for one Charlene Harris in Legal, didn\u2019t you? Why?\u2019\n\u2018She came down with a stomach bug,\u2019 Natasha said.\n\u2018Yes, vomiting everywhere.\u2019 Stark clicked his tongue. \u2018So much so, she had to be admitted to hospital for dehydration.\u2019\nNatasha then affected a concerned look, but she really didn\u2019t care. Sacrifices had to be made. \u2018I had no idea.\u2019\n\u2018Really?\u2019 Then Stark\u2019s pleasant smile was suddenly gone, and a blank look was in its place. \u2018Because you gave her a cup of tea before she got sick. The hospital staff did a blood test and found a narcotic in her blood stream.\u2019\nShit. Natasha\u2019s mind raced. \u2018I have no idea what happened, Mr. Stark.\u2019\n\u2018No, I think you do,\u2019 Stark said. He clapped again and Natasha was stunned to see her own S.H.I.E.L.D. profile pop up. \u2018See, when it became apparent I\u2019d be crossing lines with S.H.I.E.L.D., the CIA gave me a bunch of profiles of agents they considered likely to be sent after me to get access to my money again. And you, Natalie Rushman, were right at the top of the list.\u2019 He inclined his head. \u2018Or should I say Natasha Romanoff?\u2019 He smirked. \u2018Or, even better, Natalia Romanova.\u2019 Stark chuckled to himself. \u2018Geez, you Black Widows sure are predictable. The best one was probably Dottie Underwood \u2013 first time she went after dad she went by Ida Emke. None of this boring keep-the-same-initials-but-localise-the-name bull.\u2019\nNatasha was glaring at him by now. He\u2019d been warned? He had her profile? That meant he\u2019d let her into the company! Why would he do that? Unless\u2026unless he was setting a trap. Natasha knew what she\u2019d done to Harris was illegal. It was under some manslaughter or OH&amp;S law. She didn\u2019t actually know and she really didn\u2019t care.\n\u2018The authorities have been called,\u2019 Potts said behind her.\nNatasha kept her glare firmly on Stark. \u2018You think you can just arrest us? This is S.H.I.E.L.D.!\u2019\n\u2018Arrest you?\u2019 Stark suddenly looked amused. \u2018Of course not. I\u2019m not a police officer, a federal agent, and I have no warrant. I have no authority to arrest you.\u2019\nNatasha smirked.\n\u2018However,\u2019 Stark went on, turning his back dismissively \u2013 foolish move, \u2018I am also a private citizen of these United States. I am in charge of a Fortune 500 company where you have caused grievous harm to one of my employees in order to gain access to me. I have the legal right to have you arrested.\u2019\nNatasha charged forward, one hand going to one of her many hidden knives. She was going to wipe that smug smirk off his face and replace it with one of terror. He was nothing compared to her! Just some narcissistic playboy born with a silver spoon in his mouth. She\u2019d worked hard for everything she had and she was the best in the business. He\u2019d give them back that money, and he wouldn\u2019t have a say in it.\nTony glanced over his shoulder, unimpressed. Before Natasha made contact, she suddenly felt her body being propelled in the opposite direction from where she\u2019d been aiming. She saw the wall heading for her, almost in slow motion, and then the world faded to black as she impacted with it.\nWhen she came around, her arms were restrained and she was strapped to some kind of gurney outside the mansion. A few guys in suits were hanging around. She recognised them. FBI. She tried to move, but the binds on her were too tight. She did however, notice the media crowd outside the gate, snapping photos of her and she glared at them hard.\n\u2018Pepper!\u2019 Starks\u2019s voice got her attention. Natasha looked over to see him walking away from one of the FBI handlers and over to his PA. \u2018See that Ms. Harris\u2019s hospital bill is paid for in full and then book her a two-week spa resort vacation. Then add some compensation in just for good measure. She shouldn\u2019t have had to suffer for this.\u2019\n\u2018Yes, Mr. Stark.\u2019 Potts said as she and Stark went back into the house.\nWhat the hell just happened?\n***\n\u2018I\u2019m glad that\u2019s over,\u2019 Pepper said as they walked in. \u2018This spy business has really been a pain to deal with.\u2019\n\u2018Afraid it\u2019s not over yet.\u2019 Tony took Pepper through to the computer he was leaning over when she brought Romanoff in. \u2018Look what I found.\u2019\n\u2018What is it?\u2019 Pepper asked.\nTony lifted a box of some sort that was plugged into the computer he was using. It looked like something out of an old-style computer. As it turned out, it was. \u2018It\u2019s the hard drive from dad\u2019s old computer. When S.H.I.E.L.D. took off with his stuff, the computer was the only thing they left alone. I guess they thought there\u2019d be nothing interesting on it. Boy, were they wrong.\u2019\n\u2018What\u2019s on it?\u2019\n\u2018A whole bunch of stuff,\u2019 Tony said. \u2018The most interesting thing is a folder with my name on it.\u2019\nTony scrolled down until they came to a folder with \u201cTONY\u201d written underneath. Tony clicked on it. There was a collection of data in there. Pepper looked at the headings of the files. Most of them pertained to either SI or S.H.I.E.L.D. \u2018So your dad always intended you to know about S.H.I.E.L.D.?\u2019\n\u2018Yup.\u2019 Tony scrolled down again, this time to the bottom, and he clicked on a file labelled \u201cWILL\u201d.\nPepper read over it. \u2018So much for \u201cleft no instructions\u201d.\u2019\n\u2018I know, right?\u2019 Tony grinned.\nPepper smiled and stepped back to send a message to Legal.\nJARVIS spoke up for the first time since before Romanoff walked in the door. \u2018Sir, I have just received a priority message from the Joint CIA/FBI Investigation Unit.\u2019\n\u2018Yeah?\u2019 Tony asked. \u2018What is it?\u2019\n\u2018It seems that Obadiah Stane has escaped.\u2019\nTony and Pepper both looked up in alarm.\n\u2018While looking through the hard drive from his father\u2019s old computer, Tony Stark discovered a digital copy of Howard Stark\u2019s Last Will and Testament. At the time of their deaths, it was believed that Howard and Maria Stark had left no instructions as no Will could be found. The contents of the Will indicate that S.H.I.E.L.D. may have removed and concealed the hard copy due to the following statement.\u2019\nText appeared on the screen and a male voice read it: At the time of my death, all Stark funds into Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement, and Logistics Division are to be frozen until such a time when Anthony Edward Stark has gained access to the databanks in their entirety and decided whether to continue funding or to withdraw funding.\n\u2018The Will also states that all stocks, properties, and investments previously owned by Howard Stark now belong to Tony Stark.\u2019\n***\nTony was amazed, really. There was so much stuff of his dad\u2019s that S.H.I.E.L.D. had taken off with, and that wasn\u2019t including his scientific endeavours at the time of his death. Some of this stuff was almost as old as Stark Industries itself was. Tony looked at FBI Director Coombes.\n\u2018I expect they tried to hide some stuff from you.\u2019\n\u2018Of course they did.\u2019 Coombes rolled his eyes. \u2018Nice job finding that inventory, by the way.\u2019\nYet another thing that was on the hard drive.\n\n\u2018Write that down.\u2019\n\n\n\u2018Pen to paper, boy.\u2019\n\n\n\u2018Write it down, Tony.\u2019\n\nOne thing dear old dad had always been big on was recording everything. It left something to be said about him. He practiced what he preached. Everything Howard had been working on, everything he owned, at the time of his death was on a list on the hard drive of his computer.\nTony sighed. \u2018Any sign of Stane?\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m afraid not. He must\u2019ve created a network over the years. He\u2019s completely disappeared.\u2019\nTony pressed his lips together. \u2018All right. Thank you.\u2019\n***\nPepper worked through SI\u2019s business of the day. Criminal charges were done. Now it was time for SI\u2019s civil charges. Legal thought they could get them on criminal charges too. The figure which S.H.I.E.L.D. had taken from SI without authorisation, or rather the figure which S.H.I.E.L.D. had stolen from the company, was staggering. It was going to take them years to pay it back, and Pepper had a good feeling they\u2019d resist coughing up.\nIt would seem that Tony\u2019s generosity was hereditary. Pepper looked down at the Louboutin shoes on her feet. They\u2019d been a gift from Tony. That was something he\u2019d always done. He\u2019d buy his friends things to make up for his screw-ups or, sometimes, just because he felt like it. It was sad to think he did this because it was the only way he knew to show affection. Likely, it was something his father had done.\nPepper had known that. She had never been so pretentious as to think she was owed the money Tony spent on her. The same could be said for Rhodey and Happy. They both knew Tony didn\u2019t have to spend all that money on them. He chose to, and it was a gift. It would now seem, though, that his father had not been as fortunate.\nHoward had clearly paid for everything while he was alive \u2013 for both S.H.I.E.L.D. and SI. Obadiah, his \u201cfriend\u201d in the company, had helped himself to any amount of money and, when that wasn\u2019t enough, he\u2019d started his illegal backdoor dealings. And Carter\u2019s S.H.I.E.L.D., then Fury\u2019s without Tony\u2019s knowledge, had been 85% funded by the Stark fortune.\nThey all took the money like they were owed it.\nRecords were discovered, while S.H.I.E.L.D. was being combed through, of interactions Howard had with various members of S.H.I.E.L.D. command. Several psychologists from both the FBI and the CIA had looked at them and agreed that Howard had been the victim of several abusive relationships which incorporated clear guilt-tripping.\nAnd if Obie had treated Howard the same way he treated Tony \u2013 by steam-rolling issues, trying to make himself out to be the good guy, and guilt-tripping him at every available opportunity \u2013 well, that meant he wasn\u2019t safe from it at SI either. In fact, it looked like the only healthy relationship he had was with his wife.\nTony had said he was always fighting with his dad, but he had a valid excuse. He\u2019d been a moody teenager. He\u2019d been a moody teenager who didn\u2019t understand why his dad was snappish and practically never home. If he\u2019d been given time, Tony would have grown out of it. He may have even noticed, at least with Obadiah, and questioned it.\nIt was extremely hard to see abuse when you were the victim.\n***\nTony sorted through his dad\u2019s old stuff.\nIt was odd, really. How hadn\u2019t he noticed that so much crap had gone missing? The sense of entitlement Carter had to snatch the whole lot was astounding. How had he never noticed this personality in her? Maybe it was a Stark thing. His father certainly never had noticed either.\nQuite a few things in here caught his interest. For instance, when he found the original blueprints for the Arc Reactor, he was surprised to find another name next to his father\u2019s: Anton Vanko. Which led to the question: who was Anton Vanko? There were a few clues in the chest where he\u2019d found the blueprints. Eventually, though, Tony had to ask JARVIS.\n\u2018Find out who Anton Vanko was.\u2019\nJARVIS came back with the answer only an hour and a half later.\n\u2018Anton Vanko was a Soviet scientist who claimed to defect from the USSR,\u2019 JARVIS said. \u2018Under this belief, your father entered a partnership with him. They created the prototype Arc Reactor. However, Dr. Vanko turned out to be lying and attempted to make off with the prototype for Russia. Had the device been smaller, I\u2019d imagine he\u2019d have been more successful.\u2019\n\u2018So what happened to Vanko?\u2019\n\u2018He was extradited back to Russia and then abandoned by his government,\u2019 JARVIS explained. \u2018He is recorded to have become a violent drunk after the fact. He does have a son, a handful of years older than you, sir, who appears to be trying to gain access to American soil. I would recommend preparations.\u2019\n\u2018Yeah,\u2019 Tony mused. \u2018Don\u2019t want to be caught with our pants down, do we? I mean, if it\u2019d gone the other way I\u2019d want revenge too.\u2019\n\u2018Except I believe your father had another job to fall back on,\u2019 JARVIS remarked.\nTony smiled bitterly. \u2018Not a healthy one from what we hear.\u2019\n\u2018True.\u2019 Some of the sass entered JARVIS\u2019s tone. \u2018But it seems the Arc Reactor was the one time your father put his foot down. Apparently, Director Carter felt entitled to the piece of technology and was quite put out that your father wouldn\u2019t give her one.\u2019\n\u2018What the hell would S.H.I.E.L.D. need an Arc Reactor for?\u2019 Tony demanded.\nHoward\u2019s voice was suddenly projected from JARVIS\u2019s speakers. \u2018What the hell do you need an Arc Reactor for?\u2019\nTony snorted in amusement.\nContinuing his search, it was another few hours before he opened a case that contained an old film reel. Curious, Tony had gone looking in the storage room. There were some things that hadn\u2019t been taken which he\u2019d brought with him when he moved to Malibu. One of those things was an old film projector.\nSetting up the film projector took a few more seconds than he was happy with but, frankly, he hadn\u2019t been expecting to need it. Grabbing a chair, Tony sat down and started playing the old film. At first, it just seemed like a rehearsal film that his dad had made back in the 70s. 1974 specifically, Tony noticed when he looked up at the sound of his name. His father was yelling at his 4-year-old self, who had just pulled something off of the model of the Stark Expo and then bellowed for his mother to come and get him. Tony frowned. He didn\u2019t remember it, but it was just so typical for\u2026\nTony stopped that thought as he watched an SI employee pick his younger self off and leave. I\u2019m falling into old habits again, aren\u2019t I? He needed to think of it from his father\u2019s perspective. The first thing was that he looked tired. The second thing Tony had to remember that in those days, film techniques were still fairly young. There was no editing anything together and splicing took more than just hitting a few buttons. Any screw-ups meant starting all over again. Now imagine a little kid comes in looking for your attention while you\u2019re trying to do that.\nMan, all of a sudden Tony didn\u2019t blame his father for snapping.\nSuddenly, his father \u2013 on the film \u2013 spoke his name again, but this time it was softer and more affectionate than Tony himself had ever heard. Tony looked up. \u2018You\u2019re too young to understand this right now, so I thought I\u2019d put it on tape for you.\u2019 He gestured to the model. \u2018I built this for you. I was limited by the technology of my time but someday you\u2019ll figure this out. And, when you do, you\u2019re gonna change the world.\u2019\nFigure what out? Was there something in the Expo he hadn\u2019t known about it?\nThen Howard\u2019s final statement caught his attention. \u2018\u2026out of all of that, my greatest creation\u2026is you.\u2019\n***\n\u2018Are you sure about this, boss?\u2019 Happy asked.\n\u2018Yup,\u2019 Tony said. \u2018Dad always wanted to branch out of the weapons business, but he never could. If Stane wasn\u2019t guilt-tripping him, Carter was demanding new weapons or upgrades on the weapons they already had. Now that those two headaches are out of the way, I figure we see if we can pull it off.\u2019\n\u2018Military\u2019s not gonna like it, Tony,\u2019 Rhodey pointed out. \u2018I mean, you got a point seeing as Howard was kinda strong-armed into staying in the weapons business after World War Two, but the military\u2019s still not gonna like it.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m not abandoning their contracts,\u2019 Tony said. \u2018I\u2019m just trying new things on top of that. Just tell them that now that I\u2019ve burned off the leaches, I\u2019m bored.\u2019\nRhodey chuckled. \u2018You know what\u2019s sad? They\u2019d actually believe that.\u2019\n\u2018Well, the military is one thing,\u2019 Pepper said. \u2018But what about the board?\u2019\n\u2018Well, seeing as half the board have been fired for compliance with Stane\u2019s backdoor dealing, the other half have actually been behaving themselves.\u2019\nPepper raised an eyebrow. \u2018And the stockholders?\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m an eccentric billionaire,\u2019 Tony said. \u2018It\u2019s my company and I can do what I like with it. If they\u2019re worried about the stocks dropping, tell them I\u2019m gonna finish something dad started in the 70s. That should calm them down.\u2019\nPepper sighed. \u2018And if they ask why he stopped?\u2019\n\u2018Tell them dad often had ideas that technology couldn\u2019t keep up with, and this was one of them.\u2019 Tony turned his head. \u2018Oh, Rhodey-buns.\u2019\n\u2018What is it?\u2019\nTony pulled something out of his jacket pocket. \u2018Look at this.\u2019\nRhodey opened it up and let out a low whistle. \u2018The blueprints for the Arc Reactor?\u2019 He frowned. \u2018Who\u2019s Anton Vanko?\u2019\n\u2018A Soviet scientist who pretended to defect, helped dad build the Arc Reactor in the 60s and then tried to steal it back to the USSR.\u2019\nHappy snorted. \u2018He tried to take off with the Arc Reactor? That thing is massive! And what\u2019s it weigh? A few tonnes? How\u2019d he expect to get it out of the country?\u2019\n\u2018No idea, but that\u2019s how dad caught him.\u2019 Tony shrugged. \u2018Turns out he had a son too, who wants to reclaim the Arc Reactor. From the S.H.I.E.L.D. files I hacked on Ivan Vanko, he\u2019s not exactly mentally stable.\u2019\n\u2018Keep an eye out for him?\u2019 Rhodey asked.\n\u2018Precisely. Now\u2026\u2019 Tony walked over to the middle of the room and yanked the sheet off of the model on the large table. \u2018\u2026let\u2019s see what we can do here.\u2019\n\u2018The old Stark Expo?\u2019 Rhodey asked as the other three gathered around.\n\u2018Dad hid something in here,\u2019 Tony said. \u2018I\u2019m gonna find out what. If that means I have to set up the whole Expo all over again, I will.\u2019\n\n3 Years Later \u2013 2008\n\nSometimes I try to do things and it just doesn\u2019t work out the way I wanted it to\n\n\nI get real frustrated and I try hard to do it and I take my time and it doesn\u2019t work out the way I wanted to\n\n\nIt\u2019s like I concentrate real hard and it just doesn\u2019t work out\n\nTony looked up at the screen. \u2018Give me an exploded view.\u2019\nThe image on the screen shifted. \u2018Compression in Cylinder 3 appears to be low,\u2019 JARVIS told him.\n\u2018Okay.\u2019\nBehind him, Pepper keyed in the access code and opened the door. The music turned off and he only heard Pepper\u2019s voice on the phone. Tony didn\u2019t look up from what he was doing. \u2018Please don\u2019t turn down my music.\u2019\nPepper hung up. \u2018You are supposed to be halfway around the world right now.\u2019\nTony began talking before Pepper finished her last word. \u2018How\u2019d she take it?\u2019\nPepper shook her hair out of her eyes. \u2018Like a champ.\u2019\n\u2018Why are you trying to hustle me outta here?\u2019\n\u2018Your flight was scheduled to leave an hour and half ago.\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s funny. I thought with it being my plane and all, that it\u2019d just wait for me to get there.\u2019\n\u2018Tony,\u2019 Pepper interrupted him. \u2018I need to speak to you about a couple of things before I get you out the door.\u2019\nTony paid the interruption no mind. He did, however, move and sit on the front tyre of the Hot Rod he was working on and turned his attention to the redhead. \u2018Doesn\u2019t it kind of defeat the whole purpose of having your own plane if it departs before you arrive?\u2019\n\u2018Larry called,\u2019 Pepper told him pointedly. \u2018He\u2019s got another buyer for the Jackson Pollock waiting in the wings. Do you want it? Yes or no?\u2019\n\u2018Is it a good representation of his spring period?\u2019 Tony asked.\n\u2018Um\u2026No,\u2019 Pepper corrected him. \u2018The Springs was actually the neighbourhood in East Hampton where he lived and worked. Not \u201cspring\u201d like the season.\u2019\n\u2018So?\u2019 Tony asked in the middle of her explanation.\nShe knew what he was asking. \u2018I think it\u2019s a fair example. Um\u2026\u2019 She pondered for a moment. \u2018I think it\u2019s incredibly overpriced.\u2019\nTony stared for a moment. \u2018I need it.\u2019 He stood up and walked past her. \u2018Buy it. Store it.\u2019\nPepper smiled and made a note. \u2018Oh, yeah. When you get to Afghanistan, there\u2019s gonna be double guards.\u2019\nTony stopped and looked back. \u2018Why?\u2019\n\u2018Stane has been seen in the area.\u2019\nTony nodded and tapped the watch on his wrist. He continued walking over to the kitchenette in the workshop. Pepper followed.\n\u2018Okay. The MIT commencement speech\u2026\u2019\n\u2018Is in June.\u2019 Tony interrupted her, exasperated. \u2018Please, don\u2019t harangue me about stuff that\u2019s way, way down\u2026\u2019\nIt was Pepper\u2019s turn to interrupt him. \u2018They\u2019re haranguing me, so I\u2019m gonna say yes.\u2019\n\u2018Well, deflect it and absorb it,\u2019 Tony said. \u2018Don\u2019t transmit it back to me.\u2019 He picked up a coffee cup and walked back over.\nThey had now moved on to talking over each other. Amazingly, to an outsider, they heard every word the other said.\n\u2018Well, I need you to sign this before you head off.\u2019\n\u2018What are you trying to get rid of me for? What, you got plans?\u2019\nThis time, Pepper didn\u2019t speak over him. \u2018As a matter of fact, I do.\u2019\nA strange look crossed Tony\u2019s face. \u2018I don\u2019t like it when you have plans,\u2019 he said, shaking his head.\n\u2018I\u2019m allowed to have plans on my birthday.\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s your birthday?\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\u2018I knew that.\u2019 Tony squinted. \u2018Already?\u2019\n\u2018Yeah,\u2019 Pepper said whimsically. \u2018Isn\u2019t that strange? It\u2019s the same day as last year.\u2019\n\u2018Well,\u2019 Tony said, quickly signing off on the papers with his free hand, \u2018get yourself something nice from me.\u2019\n\u2018I already did.\u2019\n\u2018And?\u2019 Tony looked like an eager puppy.\n\u2018Oh, it was very nice.\u2019\n\u2018Yeah?\u2019\n\u2018Very tasteful. Thank you, Mr. Stark.\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019re welcome, Miss Potts.\u2019\nShe took the pen back. Tony drowned the coffee and handed her the cup. He then walked up out of the workshop to get ready for his little trip.\n***\n\u2018For three hours,\u2019 Rhodey grouched. \u2018For three hours you got me standing here.\u2019\n\u2018Waiting on you now,\u2019 Tony said flippantly. \u2018Let\u2019s go. Come on. Wheels up. Let\u2019s rock and roll.\u2019\nHogan just dropped off Tony\u2019s bags and then departed from the plane. He was the SI Head of Security, but he\u2019d have no real job in Afghanistan. That was for the military. Soon, they were in the air. Rhodey, still annoyed at being made to wait, sat back with a magazine.\n\u2018What are you reading, platypus?\u2019 Tony suddenly asked.\n\u2018Nothing,\u2019 Rhodey muttered.\n\u2018Come on, sourpatch,\u2019 Tony said. \u2018Don\u2019t be mad.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m not mad. I\u2019m indifferent, okay?\u2019\n\u2018I said I was sorry.\u2019\nRhodey finally looked up. \u2018You don\u2019t respect yourself, so I know you don\u2019t respect me.\u2019\n\u2018I respect you,\u2019 Tony insisted.\n\u2018I\u2019m just your babysitter,\u2019 Rhodey said. \u2018So, when you need your diaper changed, let me know and I\u2019ll get you a bottle, okay?\u2019\nTony suddenly turned to the attractive female attendant \u2013 and wasn\u2019t that the only kind of attendants he had? \u2018Hey, heat up the sake, will you?\u2019 She smiled, nodded, and went off. Tony turned back to Rhodey. \u2018Thanks for reminding me.\u2019\n\u2018No, I\u2019m not talking\u2014We\u2019re not drinking!\u2019 Rhodey insisted. \u2018We\u2019re working right now.\u2019\n\u2018You can\u2019t have sashimi without sake,\u2019 Tony said as if it was a piece of wisdom.\n\u2018You are constitutionally incapable of being responsible!\u2019 Even as he said it, Rhodey knew it was a lie. Three years ago Tony had shown himself not only capable of being responsible, but thorough, methodical, and ruthless.\nSure, S.H.I.E.L.D. still stood, but not in the capacity they had before. 85% of their funds were gone and the world watched their every move with intense scrutiny and deep suspicion. Obadiah had been caught red-handed and now was constantly on the run from the law. And the Black Widow \u2013 one of the most accomplished spies in the world \u2013 she had spent 6 months in prison getting out to find her face was known, all her aliases were known, and her methods were known.\nAll because these people had crossed Tony Stark.\nAfghanistan\u2018Is it better to be feared on respected? I say, is it too much to ask for both?\u2019 Tony stood before the United States and allied Afghani military and addressed them. \u2018With that in mind, I humbly present the crown jewel of Stark Industries Freedom Line. It\u2019s the first missile system to incorporate our proprietary Repulsor technology.\u2019 Tony paused for dramatic effect. \u2018They say the best weapon is one you never have to fire. I respectfully disagree. I prefer the weapon you only have to fire once. That\u2019s how dad did it. That\u2019s how America does it. And its worked out pretty well so far.\u2019\nWatching, Rhodey smiled to himself. Three years ago, Tony had learned to respect what his father had done for him. Three years ago, Tony had been able to release the bitterness surrounding Howard\u2019s memory \u2013 the misconception that the \u201caccident\u201d had been Howard\u2019s fault. Tony now viewed Howard\u2019s memory through the eyes of an adult rather than a child. There was a stark difference.\nRhodey winced. No pun intended.\n\u2018Find an excuse to let one of these off the chain,\u2019 Tony said, \u2018and I personally guarantee you the bad guys won\u2019t even want to come out of their caves.\u2019\nA series of smaller missiles were launched. The point of this, Rhodey knew, was to contrast and compare regular missiles to this one. Then the actual missile itself was launched.\n\u2018For your consideration,\u2019 Tony said, \u2018the Jericho.\u2019\nEver the showman, Tony slowly lifted his arms.\nThe explosion was magnificent.\n***\n\u2018Hey, Tony.\u2019\nTony leaned out of the humvee as his best friend walked over. He couldn\u2019t resist a crack. \u2018I\u2019m sorry, this is the fun-vee. The hum-drum-vee is back there.\u2019\nRhodey cracked a bit of a grin. \u2018Nice job.\u2019\n\u2018See you back at base.\u2019 Tony pulled back into the humvee as Rhodey went off to his own transport. Soon enough, they were moving again. Tony only had one problem with the trip as they went. Everyone was too quiet. Sure, he was used to people being in awe of him. He hated it when they were so in awe they were scared to speak though.\u2018I feel like you\u2019re driving me to a court martial,\u2019 Tony said. \u2018This crazy! What did I do? I feel like you\u2019re gonna pull over and snuff me. What?\u2019 He looked at the kid next to him. \u2018Not allowed to talk?\u2019\nThe kid was fighting off a grin, but still said nothing.\n\u2018Hey, Forrest!\u2019\n\u2018You can talk, sir,\u2019 the kid said.\n\u2018Oh.\u2019 He glanced out the window again. \u2018I see. So it\u2019s personal?\u2019\nThe driver spoke up. \u2018No, you intimidate him.\u2019\n\u2018Good God, you\u2019re a woman!\u2019 He legitimately hadn\u2019t noticed that before she spoke. \u2018Honestly, I couldn\u2019t have called that. I\u2019d apologise, but isn\u2019t that what we\u2019re going for here?\u2019\nForrest grinned and the older guy turned around.\nTony went on. \u2018I thought of you as a soldier first.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m an airman,\u2019 she said.\n\u2018You have an actual-actual bone structure there. I\u2019m kinda\u2026having a hard time not looking at you now. Is that weird?\u2019\nThe soldiers in the hum-vee with him cracked up laughing.\nTony grinned. Ice successfully broken. Forrest tried to hold it down again. Tony looked at him. \u2018Come on. It\u2019s okay, laugh. Hey!\u2019\n\u2018Excuse me, sir, I have a question to ask,\u2019 the guy in front said.\n\u2018Yes. Please.\u2019 Tony was just glad they weren\u2019t silent anymore.\n\u2018Is it true you went twelve-for-twelve with last year\u2019s Maxim cover models?\u2019\nTony took off his sunglasses. \u2018That is an excellent question. Yes and no. March and I had a scheduling conflict, but fortunately the Christmas cover was twins.\u2019 He paused. \u2018Anything else?\u2019\nForrest lifted a hand.\n\u2018You\u2019re kidding me with the hand up, right?\u2019\n\u2018Is it okay if I take a picture with you?\u2019\n\u2018Yes. Yes, very cool.\u2019\nForrest eagerly moved over and pulled a camera out of his pocket. He handed it to the guy up front. As the kid moved next to Tony, he put up a peace sign. Tony spoke as the older guy started winding the camera. \u2018I don\u2019t wanna see this on your MySpace page.\u2019 He glanced over and decided to have a bit more of a joke. \u2018Please, no gang signs.\u2019\nForrest immediately put it down.\nTony glanced at him. \u2018No, throw it up. I\u2019m kidding.\u2019\nHe grinned and put it back up.\n\u2018Yeah, peace,\u2019 Tony said. \u2018I love peace. I\u2019d be out of a job with peace.\u2019\nForrest chuckled and then spoke to the guy up front. \u2018Come on. Come on! Just take it. Don\u2019t change the settings.\u2019\nSuddenly, an explosion went off right in front of them. The three soldiers cried out in alarm. The car came to a standstill. Fear gripped Tony. The airmen around him started yelling nonsensically. He couldn\u2019t decipher any of the words, or what they meant. His eyes stared out the front windshield as he pressed his back against the seat.\n\u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019 he demanded. His only response was more nonsensical yelling. They all grabbed their guns. \u2018Where are you going?\u2019 Happy would never leave his side if he was here.\nThe woman went to jump out of the vehicle and was immediately shot. The guy in front yelled something, but Tony didn\u2019t understand a word of it. Then he jumped out. Forrest, next to him, grabbed his shoulder and pushed him down and wrestled with his gun. Tony hugged the divider. His heart felt like it was going to pound out of his chest. He knew, if he was here, Happy would either cover Tony with his own body or pull him out to better cover.\n\nCause, let\u2019s be honest: this thing is fully exposed on the side of the road\u2026Shit!\n\nTony looked out the front. He could see the older guy opening fire on someone from across the hood. A bullet hit the windshield. The glass cracked deep. \u2018Ah!\u2019 Tony flinched back against the seat in fright.\nForrest finally got the ammo in. \u2018Right.\u2019 He kicked the door open and hopped out.\nAs he slammed the door shut, panic seized Tony. \u2018W-w-wait! Jimmy, don\u2019t\u2014\u2019 Don\u2019t leave me alone!\n\u2018Stay in!\u2019 he barked through the window before he turned and headed off. Suddenly an array of bullets was released. Tony flinched against his seat again, jamming his eyes shut. Forrest fell back, dead. The entire vehicle shook. Something like dust fell onto him. Tony\u2019s eyes skated around. The guy at the front was gone, doubtlessly dead by the front tire.\nPepper\u2019s words suddenly came back to him: Stane has been seen in the area.\nBut what good would killing him here and now be? Stane was completely cut off from the company. He was out and gone and there was nothing to be said or done about it. Hell, Tony had even put quite a few assurances down to ensure Stane could never lay his mitts on Stark money ever again.\nThere was one thing Tony was sure of now, though: he had to get out of here!\nTony kicked open the door and jumped out of the humvee. He immediately flinched back into the vehicle as a mortar went off. But Tony didn\u2019t stop. He ran from the road, seeking better cover than the exposed wasteland. As he ran, Tony saw some rocks that looked good enough to offer ample cover.\nSomething exploded behind him and Tony rolled over the rock. He came to rest against it and panted for breath. He didn\u2019t know where Rhodey was, but he wished he\u2019d been with him. Rhodey would\u2026Tony couldn\u2019t even finish the thought. He almost felt like crying.\nOh, God\u2026Pepper\u2026Tony scrabbled for his cell phone. He yanked it out of his suit pocket and flicked it open. He started typing in Pepper\u2019s number. Suddenly, he was interrupted as something hit the ground next to him. Tony twisted his head\u2026and froze. A shell had landed \u2013 definitely defective stock because, written along the side was \u201cStark Industries\u201d.\n\nLeftovers?\n\nTony scrambled backwards but too slow. The shell detonated. Tony was lifted clear into the air and thrown back. He hit the ground and gasped for breath, but the most noticeable pain was in the front of his torso. Tony blinked, dazed, and then looked down. His white shirt was quickly soaking with red patches that kept growing. Tony grabbed at the material and ripped the shirt open.\nThe bullet-proof vest he wore underneath had done nothing to protect him from bomb shrapnel. The world slowly began to fade around him. A feeling of dread welled up. Was he going to die? Even as he lost his battle with consciousness, a single name drifted across his mind.\n\nPepper\u2026\n\nWith a start, Tony woke up.\nWhere am I? All Tony could see around him was darkness. There was discomfort in his nasal cavity. Reaching up for it, Tony found an IV line. Acting on pure instinct, he took a hold of it and pulled. The sensation of the tube was strange\u2026unpleasant, a dragging up his oesophagus. When it finally came free, Tony gasped. He tossed it aside and looked around.\nThere were some things on a crate next to him. Reaching out blindly, Tony scrabbled for one of them. His motor functions must\u2019ve been off because what he was reaching for \u2013 felt like a glass \u2013 was knocked from the crate instead. A sound suddenly got his attention.\nThere was a man a short distance away. Tony couldn\u2019t see him clearly, though. Fear churning up his gut, Tony rolled towards the crate again. Maybe there was something on the crate he could use as a weapon. Something pulled at his chest though, stopping him from getting close enough.\n\u2018I wouldn\u2019t do that if I were you,\u2019 the man said.\nHe rolled back and looked down. There were bandages wrapped around his chest, but the wires going under weren\u2019t medical ones. They were cables. Tony followed them up first to where they were attached to a car battery which sat on an old table of some kind. Tony grabbed the cables and followed them down to the bandaged. Panting in anxiousness, adrenalin pumping through him, Tony tore the bandages open. As they came out of the way Tony saw where the cables were going.\nThere was a large metal contraption imbedded right in the middle of his sternum.\n***\nYinsen whistled as he cooked. He was just waiting for Stark to collect himself. He knew how overwhelming this could be. It was not like when he had been taken. Stark did not know who he had been captured by, or why it had been done, and he had been grievously injured in the process. Yinsen had no such complications when they took him prisoner.\nStark was sitting up by now, staring at the reflection in the mirror he now held. \u2018What the hell did you do to me?\u2019 he finally demanded.\n\u2018What I did?\u2019 Yinsen laughed softly. \u2018What I did is to save your life. I removed all the shrapnel I could but there\u2019s a lot left, and its heading into your atrial septum.\u2019 He picked up a small specimen tube and stepped towards the billionaire. \u2018Here, want to see? I have a souvenir. Take a look.\u2019 He tossed the tube to Stark.\nStark, for his part, caught it one-handed, so his hand-eye coordination had recovered.\nYinsen turned back to his cooking, allowing Stark to absorb what had happened to him. \u2018I\u2019ve seen many wounds like that in my village. We call them the walking dead, because it takes about a week for the barbs to reach the vital organs.\u2019\n\u2018What is this?\u2019 Stark asked, gesturing to the device in his chest.\nYinsen\u2019s voice hardened. \u2018It is an electromagnet, hooked up to a car battery, and it is keeping the shrapnel from entering your heart.\u2019 He finished with a curt nod.\nStark shifted uncomfortably and zipped up the jacket he was wearing, concealing the magnet from view. He then looked around and his eyes focused in on something. Yinsen turned his head to look. Ah. He\u2019s spotted the security camera. He turned back to him.\n\u2018That\u2019s right,\u2019 he said. \u2018Smile.\u2019\nStark didn\u2019t. He instead continued looking around.\n\u2018We met once, you know,\u2019 Yinsen told him, hoping to distract him, \u2018at a technical conference in Bern.\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t remember,\u2019 Stark said.\nYinsen grinned at the memory. \u2018No, you wouldn\u2019t. If I had been that drunk, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to stand, much less give a lecture on integrated circuits.\u2019\n\u2018Where are we?\u2019 Stark asked softly.\nBefore Yinsen could answer the viewing panel on the door was slid open and an unpleasantly familiar voice \u2013 Bakaar \u2013 barked orders at him. Fear shot through him. Yinsen grabbed Stark\u2019s arm and pulled the other man to his feet. \u2018Come on, stand up! Stand up! Just do as I do!\u2019\nThe door opened and the guards came in, heavily armed.\nStark stared at the guns. \u2018Those are my guns\u2026\u2019\n\u2018Do you understand me?!\u2019 Yinsen guided his hands up to his hand. \u2018Do as I do.\u2019\nBakaar stepped forward, arms spread wide with a rolled up bit of paper in one hand, and a mock-friendly smile on his face. As he did not speak English, he instead spoke in Arabic. When he finished, he waited. Stark gave him a blank look. He did not speak the language \u2013 and why should he? Few westerners went out of their way to learn Arabic. English was the language of business. The languages Stark would know aside from his mother tongue would be European rather than Middle Eastern.\nBakaar turned to Yinsen in annoyance and barked out an order.\n\u2018I\u2019m being told to translate,\u2019 Yinsen told Stark. \u2018He says \u201cwelcome, Tony Stark, the most famous mass murderer in the history of America\u201d. He is honoured.\u2019\nFrom the look on Stark\u2019s face, he didn\u2019t appreciate the sentiment.\nBakaar went on talking.\nYinsen translated. \u2018He wants you to build the missile. The Jericho missile that you demonstrated.\u2019 Bakaar handed him the rolled up paper and Yinsen showed the photograph to Stark. \u2018This one.\u2019\nStark stared at the picture intently. It only took a moment before he lifted his eyes back to the terrorists. The set in his jaw told Yinsen what he was going to say before the words left his mouth. He remembered that this was a man who had exposed, sued, and completely defeated a shadow organisation that had thought itself invincible. He was not the sort of man who would be cowed by anyone.\nNo, not even terrorists.\n\u2018I refuse.\u2019\nBakaar may not have understood English, but Stark\u2019s tone was enough of a translation.They were hauled out of the cell, Stark grabbing and clutching the battery as they went. Yinsen watched with a heavy heart as Stark\u2019s head was continuously and forcefully dunked into a barrel of cold water. That was the very least of what they did to him. By the time they were led outside, Stark blinking at the sudden sunlight, Yinsen could see the rumours \u2013 that Stark was a soft rich-boy with a silver spoon in his mouth \u2013 were greatly exaggerated.\nThere was an impressive strength to him.\nMost would have buckled under the pressure by now.\nBakaar led them into the encampment, Stark being pushed roughly by one of the insurgents. Stark said nothing as they walked. He just looked around, eyeing all of the weapons bearing his name. He did not look surprised, but merely annoyed. Was it three years ago that Stark had found an long-serving underling backdoor dealing out of his company? Stark knew how they\u2019d gotten his weapons.\nAnd he clearly didn\u2019t like it.\nBakaar finally spoke, short and clipped.\n\u2018He wants to know what you think,\u2019 Yinsen said.\n\u2018I think you got a lot of my weapons.\u2019 The anger in Stark\u2019s voice could not be missed.Bakaar began circling around Stark, speaking loudly. He was trying to make Stark feel powerless. The expression on Stark\u2019s face, however, did not leave that impression. Stark did not move from the frown. He did not look scared as he had when he had awoken.\nYinsen translated. \u2018He says they have everything you need to build the Jericho Missile. He wants you to make a list of materials. He says for you to start working immediately, and when you are done, he will set you free.\u2019\nBakaar came to stand in front of Stark. He inclined his head as if Stark was a particularly stupid animal. He then put his hand out. It was laughable really, in different circumstances. Stark was recognised and celebrated internationally as one of the most brilliant minds of the century.\nStark then put on a smile easily recognised in the business world and shook Bakaar\u2019s hand. \u2018No, he won\u2019t,\u2019 he said.\nYinsen agreed. \u2018No, he won\u2019t.\u2019\nStark then looked up, to where Raza stood.\nOne of the most brilliant minds of the century.\n***\nThe two men sat in front of a small fire.\nTony was curled up, staring into the flames. A beanie on his head and a jacket hugged tight around his frame. Yinsen sat across from him. He\u2019d put a peaked cap on his head but otherwise wore his dirty three-piece suit. Yinsen was leaned forward, trying to get his point across.\n\u2018I\u2019m sure they\u2019re looking for you, Stark,\u2019 he said. \u2018But they will never find you in these mountains. Look, what you just saw, that is your legacy, Stark. Your life\u2019s work in the hands of those murderers. Is that how you want to go out? Is this the last act of defiance of the Great Tony Stark? Or are you going to do something about it?\u2019\n\u2018Why should I do anything? They\u2019re going to kill me, you, either way. Even if this is Stane\u2019s attempt at getting me killed and taking my company, I\u2019ve got failsafes in place. He won\u2019t get it. Regardless of that, I\u2019ll probably be dead within a week.\u2019\n\u2018Well, then, this is a very important week for you, isn\u2019t it?\u2019\n***\n\nTony knew he was in a dream.\n\n\nThe walls had not looked so tall since he was a small child. And he walked through his childhood home. He trotted to one door in particular and pushed it open. Inside, his parents sat in expensive chairs, in front of a gated fire in the hearth. As he stepped in, his mother lifted her eyes from her knitting and his father lifted his eyes from the contact in his lap.\n\n\n\u2018Come here, Tony,\u2019 Howard said, setting the contract aside.\n\n\nTony had trotted over. His suspicions on his age here were confirmed when his father picked him up and sat him on his lap.\n\n\n\u2018Listen to me, Tony,\u2019 his father said. \u2018Stark men are made of iron. We are forged in fire. We bend but we don\u2019t break. You\u2019re in trouble now, but you can get out of it.\u2019\n\n\n\u2018I can?\u2019 Tony heard himself ask.\n\n\n\u2018That\u2019s what this is for.\u2019 Howard tapped Tony\u2019s forehead. \u2018You\u2019re a genius, Tony. Your biggest strength is your brain. The base is strategically located. No one will find you. No one will save you, so you have to save yourself.\u2019\n\nTony opened his eyes.\n***\nTony began his work. \u2018If this is going to be my work station, I want it well-lit. I want these up. I need welding gear. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s acetylene or propane. I need a soldering station. I need helmets. I\u2019m gonna need goggles. I would like a smelting cup. I need two sets of precision tools.\u2019\nTony started his work. As he did, he started feeling his way through the situation. He needed to know all of the resources at his disposal. He\u2019d be damned if he let Obadiah Stane have the last laugh. His entire focus was on getting back home; back to Pepper and JARVIS and Rhodey and Happy.\n\u2018How many languages do you speak?\u2019 he asked his cellmate.\n\u2018A lot, but apparently not enough for this place. They speak Arabic, Urdu, Dari, Pashto, Mongolian, Farsi, Russian.\u2019\n\u2018\u2026Who are these people?\u2019\n\u2018They are your loyal customers, sir. They call themselves the Ten Rings.\u2019\n***\n\u2018You know, we might be more productive if you include me in the planning process.\u2019\n\u2018Ya ha.\u2019\n***\n\u2018Don\u2019t need this.\u2019\n***\n\u2018What is that?\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s palladium. 0.15 grams. We need at least 1.6, so why don\u2019t you go break down the other 11?\u2019\n***\nThe creation began to take shape. He needed help with some of it.\n\u2018Careful. Careful, we only get one shot at this.\u2019\n\u2018Relax, I have steady hands. Why do you think you\u2019re still alive?\u2019\n***\nThen Tony remembered. \u2018What do I call you?\u2019\n\u2018My name is Yinsen.\u2019\n\u2018Yinsen. Nice to meet you.\u2019\nIt threw him for a second. \u2018Nice to meet you too.\u2019\n***\nFinally, it was finished. Tony looked down at his creation. A blue glow was cast upon his face. It was perfect. Tony took some time to admire his handiwork. Dad would have been proud. For years leading up to his death, he\u2019d talked about miniaturising the thing. Yinsen wandered over and looked over his shoulder.\n\u2018That doesn\u2019t look like a Jericho Missile,\u2019 he remarked.\n\u2018That\u2019s because it\u2019s a miniturised Arc Reactor,\u2019 Tony said. \u2018I got a big one powering my factory at home. It should keep the shrapnel out of my heart.\u2019\n\u2018But what could it generate?\u2019\n\u2018If my math is right, and it always is, three gigajoules per second.\u2019\n\u2018That could run your heart for 50 lifetimes.\u2019\n\u2018Yeah, or something big for 15 minutes.\u2019 May as well show him. Tony pulled out the plans. \u2018This is our ticket outta here.\u2019\n\u2018What is it?\u2019\n\u2018Flatten them out and look.\u2019 Tony did it himself, arranging them to show Yinsen the plans they went together to create.\n\u2018Impressive.\u2019\n***\nTony felt a lot better with the Arc Reactor in his chest.\nHe and Yinsen sat down to play Backgammon with improvised parts. Tony looked up at the other man. \u2018You still haven\u2019t told me where you\u2019re from.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m from a small town called Gulmira. It\u2019s actually a nice place.\u2019\n\u2018Got a family?\u2019\n\u2018Yes, and I will see them when I leave here. And you, Stark?\u2019\n\u2018No. Not anymore.\u2019\n\u2018Even now? So\u2026you\u2019re a man who has everything, and nothing.\u2019\nTony smiled awkwardly.\n***\nThe next morning, they began work on their escape plan. They built and welded. A metal suit of armour was coming together. Tony supposed it had always been too much to hope that they could build the whole thing without getting noticed. As they\u2019d finished the body frame, the panel slid open and Bakaar barked orders.\nTony and Yinsen put down their tools, turned around, and put their hands on their heads. Unlike last time though, it was not Bakaar who led the men in. No, he didn\u2019t come into their cell at all. The man who came in was a tall and thin bald man with a disdainful expression.\nThis was the true leader of the Ten Rings.\nThe bald man looked around a moment before he said one word. \u2018Relax.\u2019\nSlowly, curiously, and suspiciously, Tony lowered his arms from his head. The bald guy wandered forward. He pulled down the collar of Tony\u2019s shirt to observe the Arc Reactor. Tony\u2019s gut clenched. If the guy ripped it out, he\u2019d go into cardiac arrest. Then, as if it was just an idle curiosity, the man began to wander about the cell.\n\u2018The bow and arrow once was the pinnacle of weapons technology,\u2019 he said. \u2018It allowed the Great Genghis Khan to conquer from the Pacific to Ukraine. An empire twice the size of Alexander the Great and four times the size of the Roman Empire. But today, whoever holds the latest Stark weapons rules these lands.\u2019\nToo bad he wasn\u2019t getting any.\n\u2018And soon it will be my turn.\u2019 He turned, sneering at Tony. He then strode back over to Tony. Stark men are made of iron. Keeping his face carefully blank, Tony did not move nor respond as the man came to a stop right in front of him and glared at him hard. After a moment, he spoke in one of the tongues.\nYinsen responded, sounding nervous.\nThe bald guy stepped away from Tony and began stalking towards Yinsen. He spoke again. As he circled him, Yinsen answered. Tony watched warily. The bald guy said something else. Two men came up behind him and forced Yinsen to his knees. Tony\u2019s gut dropped. The leader walked over to the fire and picked up a red hot poker. The bald guy stepped forward and said something else. Yinsen protested something.\nTony still remembered the blistering sting of that method on his skin.\n\u2018What does he want?\u2019 Tony demanded.\nThe bald guy said something else.\n\u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019 Tony tried again.\nThe bald guy ignored him again and made a demand, advancing on Yinsen. Yinsen continued trying to reason with him, Tony imagined. But this guy clearly had more than a few screws loose. He yelled at him. Yinsen repeated whatever he\u2019d said before, beginning to sound desperate.\nWithout thinking about it, Tony took a few steps forward. \u2018What do you want? A delivery date?\u2019\nSuddenly Bakaar reappeared, yelling and putting a hand up. The insurgents not holding down Yinsen turned their guns on him. Tony may have been shit at social interaction, but he could still read the cues. They were scared of him. If they weren\u2019t, they wouldn\u2019t have reacted so strongly to him moving towards their leader. And not one of them dared pull the trigger. They still needed him.\nIt was a small advantage, but it was an advantage.\nTony had made a career out of capitalising on advantages; it was one of the things his father had managed to drum into his thick head. \u2018I need him. Good assistant.\u2019\nThe bald guy glared at him. As he dropped the poker Tony knew he\u2019d won \u2013 for now.\n\u2018You have til tomorrow to assemble my missile.\u2019 That said, the bald guy brushed out with a disdainful sneer.\nTony breathed a sigh of relief.\nBut now they had only a night to assemble the suit into a functioning defence. The two of them worked tirelessly. They were running short on time as they finished. Tony strapped up his hands and pulled on anything heat-resistant that he\u2019d been able to find and gather over his time in this place. Yinsen strapped Tony into the suit.\n\u2018Okay?\u2019 Yinsen asked. \u2018Can you move?\u2019\nTony tested it. The suit was heavy, but he was still mobile.\nYinsen nodded. \u2018Okay, say it again.\u2019\n\u201841 steps straight ahead. Then 16 steps, that\u2019s from the door, fork right, then 33 steps, turn right.\u2019\nThey were interrupted when the panel was slid open and something was yelled into the cell. Yinsen froze.\n\u2018What?\u2019 Tony muttered.\n\u2018He\u2019s speaking Hungarian. I don\u2019t\u2026speak much of it.\u2019\n\u2018Okay. Just say \u201cStark dolgoztat. Ha abbahagyom, akkor nem kapja meg a rak\u00e9t\u00e1j\u00e1t id\u0151ben\u201d.\u2019\nYinsen paused, but turned and repeated what he\u2019d been told.\nThe panel was then slid closed after a moment and they were left alone again. Yinsen returned to work. \u2018You speak Hungarian?\u2019\n\u2018When I was a kid, our butler\u2019s wife was Hungarian. She taught me the language.\u2019\nYinsen nodded as he fastened the last of the joints and began to power up the suit. \u2018So what did you just have me tell them?\u2019\n\u2018You said \u201cStark has me working. If I stop, you won\u2019t get your missile in time\u201d.\u2019\nThey both suddenly heard the yelling.\n\u2018What\u2019s that?\u2019 Yinsen asked. \u2018It\u2019s Hungarian again, but\u2026\u2019\n\u2018This other guy didn\u2019t buy it,\u2019 Tony said. \u2018They\u2019re coming in.\u2019\nThe bolt slid across.\n\nKA-BOOM!\n\nThe entire doorway exploded in fire as they tried to open it. Why they thought they could put Tony in a room with this many of his explosives and expect him not to toss a bomb at them, he had no idea. But now they had to worry about the rest of them rushing in. Still\u2026Tony didn\u2019t have a good view.\n\u2018How\u2019d that work?\u2019 he asked.\n\u2018Oh, my goodness.\u2019 Yinsen leaned over to look. \u2018It worked all right.\u2019\nTony smiled in grim satisfaction. \u2018That\u2019s what I do.\u2019\nEven now, though, the tension was mounting. They needed more time for the suit to charge up. Yinsen moved around, trying to speed up the process. He was as anxious as Tony was. They also had to ensure the suit wouldn\u2019t fall apart under any circumstances.\n\u2018Every other hex bolt\u2026\u2019 Tony mused, reaffirming his original design.\n\u2018They\u2019re coming,\u2019 Yinsen pointed out.\n\u2018Nothing pretty. Just get it done. Just get it done.\u2019\n\u2018They\u2019re coming.\u2019\nYinsen moved around and looked at the screen which told them the progress of the suit\u2019s power-up.\n\u2018Make sure the check-points are clear before you follow me out, okay?\u2019 Tony said.\n\u2018We need more time.\u2019 Yinsen spoke quietly and then turned to Tony. \u2018I\u2019m going to buy you some time.\u2019 He turned and ran.\n\u2018Stick to the plan!\u2019 Tony called. \u2018Stick to the plan! Yinsen!\u2019\nBut Yinsen was gone, scooping up a gun from a dead guard as he went. Tony heard the gunshots. He couldn\u2019t move anywhere yet though. The suit still needed to charge. It was taking energy from the hideout to do it. Tony couldn\u2019t do anything until the suit\u2019s power was ready to go. After what seemed like an eternity, the lights dimmed and the suit activated.\nTony pulled the metal helmet on.\nWatching as two of the insurgents stepped in, looking like they\u2019d been pushed, Tony waited. They split and wandered around, looking for him. One of them stepped closer, closer, close enough. Tony lifted one arm and activated the flamethrower. The insurgent in front of him was lifted clear off his feet and thrown across the cell. The rest of the insurgents, including a large group of them outside, opened fire.\n\nReally? You thought I didn\u2019t think of that?\n\nThe bullets bounced off the metal shell of the suit. Tony walked in the thing, as heavy and awkward as it was, through and out of the cell. He stepped through the door and knocked them all aside before continuing on. Following Yinsen\u2019s instructions to the exit, Tony walked. Two insurgents came mindlessly charging down the tunnel. They went down too.\nThere was a sense of vindication in Tony as he moved through the hideout. These guys had illegally bought his weapons to terrorise innocent people and attack the soldiers said weapons were supposed to protect. They had kidnapped him and tried to intimidate him into building a missile for them. Tony Stark did not react well to people who tried to push him around \u2013 especially not people who thought they could terrorise him.\nHe came to the fork and blew back the next obstacle. Tony turned right. The insurgents were now just running away from him. They ran down the tunnel and through the door, slamming it shut. Unfortunately for one guy, he got trapped on the other side.\nTony advanced, not allowing mercy to cross his mind.\n***\nYinsen lay there, dying but happy.\nThe sound of the heavy armour approaching was good. That meant it had worked and Stark had a hope of getting out of here alive. The men had all long-since fled past him. Even as he covered his wounds, Yinsen knew there was really moot point. Still, the sandbags were as comfy a place as any to die.\n\u2018Yinsen!\u2019 Stark\u2019s voice was muffled by the armour as he moved over as fast as it would allow him.\nYinsen looked up, and immediately saw Raza, the Ten Rings leader, aiming a grenade launcher at Stark\u2019s back. He called out a warning. Stark stopped and turned. The billionaire jerked back as the grenade was launched at him. In other circumstances, it would have been funny. The leader of an insurgent group having aim that bad. It didn\u2019t even come close to hitting Stark, and the grenade exploded off to the side.\nStark lifted his arm and the panel in the arm slid open. A missile shot out. Yinsen was under no allusions that Stark had missed. He\u2019d seen the man aim when throwing things in their captivity. No, he intentionally hit the wall behind Raza. The wall caved in and Raza screamed as he was buried.\nStark knelt down next to him. He lifted the faceplate.\n\u2018Stark,\u2019 Yinsen said.\n\u2018Come on,\u2019 Stark insisted. \u2018We got to go. Move for me, come on. We got a plan. We\u2019re gonna stick to it.\u2019\n\u2018This was always the plan, Stark.\u2019\n\u2018Come on, you\u2019re gonna go see your family. Get up.\u2019\n\u2018My family\u2019s dead,\u2019 Yinsen said. \u2018I\u2019m going to see them now, Stark.\u2019\nStark froze, but then he swallowed.\n\u2018It\u2019s okay. I want this. I want this.\u2019\nStark gave him a tight smile. \u2018Thank you for saving me.\u2019\n\u2018Don\u2019t waste it,\u2019 Yinsen said with his last breath. \u2018Don\u2019t waste your life.\u2019\n***\nThe remaining insurgents waited, all of them with their guns trained to the entrance of their hideout. They waited. Movement. All off them opened fire. Still, the suit of armour with Stark inside continued to advance. They shot until they\u2019d emptied their guns. Still, he stood there.\n\u2018My turn.\u2019\nFlames exploded from Stark\u2019s arms and he lifted them to extend over them. The men screamed and scrambled, some of them catching fire. All of the Stark Industries weapons in their possession were somehow detonated. They tried to gather themselves and fight back. One insurgent found a weak point when he managed to sever one of the exposed wires in the back of the suit and render a leg inoperable.\nJust when they thought they may have an advantage, flames spurted out of the feet of the suit and Stark was propelled off the ground. In a blazing inferno that ripped apart the rest of the insurgents, he exited the mountains in a rocket-propelled leap that took him right into the desert.\nTony Stark had escaped.\n***\nCaptain Carol Danvers had gone to Command School with Lt. Col. James Rhodes.\nIn the military, he was one of her closest friends. He was one of the few that had not added \u201cfor a girl\u201d either explicitly or implicitly onto any congratulatory statements for her achievements. When she had the incident which gave her the powers she now wielded, he had been the one to help her. The military had wanted to study her powers \u2013 putting it very nicely.\nRhodey had called his friend Whom The Military Did Not Want To Piss Off and they\u2019d both protected her. They\u2019d both manoeuvred her into the position she was in now. Who knew that many alien races went poking around looking to take over the planet? Carol was, at present, the only one on the planet with the power to stop them.\nSo, when Tony was kidnapped by violent insurgents, Carol had instantly responded to Rhodey\u2019s pleas for people to help him look. It had been three months and he still wasn\u2019t giving up on him. That kind of friendship was very rare. Then again, Carol knew Tony. She was one of the few women he hadn\u2019t hit on \u2013 though she had come to suspect it was because Tony thought Rhodey might be romantically interested in her.\nCarol didn\u2019t know if she was imagining it, so she tended to ignore it.\nOn this day, as she flew over the Afghani desert, she actually saw something different. A figure came rocketing out of one of the mountain ranges and plunged back down to earth. Carol changed her course and headed for where it\u2019d landed. When she came to the area, she saw a lone figure struggling out of armour of some kind.\nAs she descended, the figure looked up and confirmed his identity.\nTony Stark lifted an arm and gave her the peace sign. Carol smiled to herself and spoke into the comm. \u2018Marvel to command. Marvel to command. I\u2019ve located Tony Stark. Repeat: I\u2019ve located Tony Stark.\u2019 She shot off the coordinates and touched down. \u2018You\u2019re a hard man to find, Tony.\u2019\nTony sighed and shrugged off the last of the armour. \u2018How long\u2019s it been?\u2019\n\u2018Three months.\u2019 Carol knelt down to help him. She pulled a canteen of water from her utility belt and handed it to him. As he guzzled the water down, she checked he was all right. Nothing seemed broken or fractured, but there was a rather unsightly device implanted deep in his chest. Carol used the heat-resistant clothes he had to shield him from the sun.\n\u2018What happened in there?\u2019 she asked.\nTony told her as they waited. Carol made a note to drop by Gulmira and see what she could find about this Yinsen fellow. She had to fire on some insurgents when they dared come out of the mountains. Well, they wouldn\u2019t be back out. With her powers, she wasn\u2019t firing with bullets.\nThe choppers arrived after what seemed forever. Carol watched as they landed. They\u2019d brought a medic with them. Rhodey was the first to depart and come running across the sand. He slowed to a walk as he approached. Carol was deeply amused with the first line he uttered.\n\u2018How was the fun-vee?\u2019\nTony began chuckling, almost sobbing.\nRhodey knelt down in front of Tony. \u2018Next time, you ride with me.\u2019\nThe quiet sounds Tony was making began to sound like sobbing now. He just about collapsed on his best friend\u2019s shoulder. Rhodey wrapped an arm around his shoulders and let his friend vent out his emotions. Carol had never understood the relationship and perhaps she never would.\nPepper stood with Happy as they watched the plane land.\nAfter the fiasco three years ago, Tony, Pepper, and JARVIS had sat down and discussed how S.H.I.E.L.D. might try to get Tony\u2019s money and what Stane might try to do with both of them now outed. While no one doubted Stane was responsible for this ordeal, S.H.I.E.L.D. was opportunistic.\nWithin 24 hours, S.H.I.E.L.D. had tried to sneak someone into accounting. JARVIS had picked the spy up instantly and he hadn\u2019t even gotten past the first stage of job application. Over the past three months S.H.I.E.L.D. had tried several other approaches, and Pepper saw exactly why clich\u00e9d spy covers were clich\u00e9d. She swore S.H.I.E.L.D. had tried every single one of them.\nPepper, as they\u2019d discussed, had been handed the interim CEO position. She\u2019d run the business as she always did and coordinated with JARVIS. As Tony had said when she raised questions about her suitability for such a role: it wasn\u2019t that different from what she did normally.\nWhile she\u2019d been holding down the fort at home, Happy taking as much of the burden from her as he could, Rhodey had gotten as many people as he could to search for Tony. She\u2019d nearly burst into tears when he\u2019d called and said Captain Danvers had found him.\nPepper hadn\u2019t been around when Captain Carol Danvers had gotten her powers, but she sure as hell heard about it. Tony had gone in, on the request of Rhodey, had used just about all of his sway with the military to prevent to poor woman from becoming a glorified lab rat.\nCarol herself was a good friend of Pepper\u2019s now, and one of the few women she could really relate to.\nPepper now watched as both Tony and Rhodey walked down, Tony having to lean on Rhodey as they walked down. She smiled watching Tony turn down medical aid. It meant he was okay. He was okay and he was home. As soon as he came to the flat ground of the airstrip, Tony let go of Rhodey and walked over to her.\n\u2018Hm,\u2019 he said. \u2018Your eyes are red. A few tears for your long-lost boss?\u2019\n\u2018Tears of joy.\u2019 It was so easy to fall back into old habits. \u2018I hate job hunting.\u2019\n\u2018Yeah. Vacation\u2019s over.\u2019 He moved past her.\n\u2018Welcome home, boss,\u2019 Happy said.\n\u2018Thanks, Hap.\u2019\nPepper and Tony climbed into the back of the car while Happy got in behind the wheel.\n\u2018Where to?\u2019 Happy asked.\n\u2018Take us to the hospital, Happy,\u2019 Pepper said.\n\u2018No.\u2019\nPepper looked over at the genius. \u2018Tony, you need to see a doctor.\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t need anything,\u2019 Tony said. \u2018I\u2019ve been in captivity for three months. There\u2019s only two things I want. The first is an American cheeseburger.\u2019 He looked at her. \u2018And the other...\u2019\nPepper figured what he was going to say. \u2018That\u2019s enough of that.\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s not that,\u2019 Tony said, surprising her. \u2018I gotta get home and finish synthesising dad\u2019s element.\u2019\nPepper looked back at him. \u2018Now? Shouldn\u2019t you rest first?\u2019\nTony sighed and unbuttoned his shirt. Pepper\u2019s admonishment of him was cut off when she saw the blue glow. Happy spun around in the front seat, brow furrowing in concern. Tony pulled his shirt out of the way, showing them the circular device buried right into his chest. Pepper\u2019s breath caught in her throat. That looked...so painful.\n\u2018What...is that?\u2019 she asked softly.\n\u2018A miniaturised Arc Reactor,\u2019 Tony said. \u2018When I was captured I got a load of shrapnel blasted into my chest. The Reactor\u2019s powering a magnet that\u2019s keeping what\u2019s left of it from entering my heart. However, the Reactor\u2019s powered by palladium, which is liable to leak into my bloodstream.\u2019\n\u2018And that\u2019d cause heavy metal poisoning,\u2019 Happy said.\n\u2018Is your dad\u2019s element really your only option?\u2019 Pepper asked. In the circumstances, it made perfect sense that he\u2019d want to go home and get on with it. Heavy metal poisoning, from the bits and pieces she knew of it, was not something anyone wanted to suffer from. Even logic said it wouldn\u2019t be pleasant \u2013 bits of heavy metal going through your blood stream; everywhere there was blood there was metal. It would wreck havoc on the body, especially on the brain.\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 Tony said. \u2018Happy, drive. Cheeseburger first.\u2019\nHappy turned back around and started the car.\nTony waited until they pulled onto the road. \u2018There is one more thing.\u2019\n\u2018What\u2019s that?\u2019 Pepper asked.\n\u2018While I was there, I noticed they had a lot of our stock.\u2019 Tony scowled. \u2018And they didn\u2019t seem nervous about using it either. I think they\u2019re still getting a steady supply somehow. I want to shut down the weapons division until we work out how.\u2019\n\u2018It shouldn\u2019t be possible,\u2019 Pepper muttered, flicking out her Blackberry. \u2018I\u2019ll reassign the men in the weapons division to other divisions until we work it out. Should I send a report to the CIA while we\u2019re at it?\u2019\n\u2018Good idea.\u2019 Tony buttoned up his shirt again. \u2018Well, you know the drill.\u2019\nPepper cracked a grin.\n***\n\nSTARK INDUSTRIES PRESS RELEASE \u2013 MAY 4, 2008\n\n\nFollowing the kidnapping and subsequent retrieval of Mr. A. E. Stark this company has discovered that our armaments are still somehow falling into illegal hands. The Central Intelligence Agency (C.I.A.) has been informed and it is for this reason that Stark Industries will be temporarily shutting down the weapons division, effective immediately, until the issue has been properly resolved.\n\n\nMr. Stark has stated, \u201cI saw American soldiers being attacked and killed by the very weapons I created to protect them. The insurgents were using them far too liberally for them to be running short on the weapons. I have considerable reason to believe these weapons are still being sold through illegal means. As removing the culprits from the company was clearly not enough to stop them, the production of the weapons will be temporarily stopped.\u201d\n\n\nMr. Stark is currently recovering from his ordeal in Afghanistan and will be unable to comment further for a number of weeks. For all enquires, his Personal Assistant, Miss Virginia Potts, is still available.\n\n\nMr. Stark has promised to take full responsibility for this disaster.\n\n***\nHappy stepped into the house, the Chinese Tony had ordered in his hand. He walked over to the massive hole in the floor and looked down. \u2018You right down there, boss?\u2019\n\u2018Yeah.\u2019 Tony hopped over some of his obstacles. \u2018Turns out most of dad\u2019s problem was he needed the Hadron Collider technology. They hadn\u2019t invented it back in the 70s.\u2019\n\u2018You got it then?\u2019\n\u2018Yup.\u2019 Tony lifted a new Arc Reactor for Happy to see. It was much like the first one, except this one had a triangular shape in the centre instead of a circular one. Then again, Happy wasn\u2019t an engineer. He didn\u2019t have the faintest idea if that was a design choice or if it had something to do with the elements that powered the things. \u2018JARVIS is just running a few more tests and then we can pop it in.\u2019\n\u2018And then I presume you\u2019ll fix the house.\u2019 Happy looked around. \u2018Pep would have a fit if she saw this.\u2019\nTony chuckled and put the new Arc Reactor down again. \u2018How are things going, by the way? Find out how they got the weapons?\u2019\nHappy nodded. \u2018Yeah, seeing as they\u2019re not taken from the company, the CIA think they\u2019re stolen in transit.\u2019\n\u2018Wonderful,\u2019 Tony grumbled.\nAfghanistan\nAn armoured truck pulled up to a temporary camp.\nObadiah Stane stepped out of the truck and walked into the camp. He walked up to a bald man with severe scarring on the side of his face. \u2018New look?\u2019 he asked, sounding annoyed.\n\u2018You can attribute this to Stark,\u2019 Raza snapped.\n\u2018Well, if you\u2019d killed him like we agreed, you wouldn\u2019t have lost half of your face.\u2019 He allowed Raza a moment to stew. \u2018Tony\u2019s method of escape?\u2019\n\u2018We have the plans.\u2019 Raza scowled. \u2018We\u2019d have the suit itself but a witch whore kept us from chasing after Stark.\u2019\n\u2018You mean Captain Marvel.\u2019 That\u2019d been the first annoying thing Tony had ever done. Obie\u2019s partners had wanted to get their hands on her, had intended to use the military\u2019s paranoia to do it, but in stepped Tony Stark. It had been the first time he\u2019d ever ignored Obie, and that had cost HYDRA a powerful weapon \u2013 perhaps even more powerful than the Asset. \u2018Well, where is it?\u2019\n\u2018You promise to provide this for us?\u2019\n\u2018Of course. All we need is the plans.\u2019\nMalibu, America\nTony almost smiled. It\u2019d taken more than a day to get the walls, floors, and windows fixed. Still the Arc Reactor had been completed and Tony had created a brand new element. He was calling it Starkanium. All he had to do now was find its full capabilities.\nBut Tony had something to work on. Don\u2019t waste your life. As a kid, his mom had always said \u201cyou make a mess, you clean it up\u201d and if this wasn\u2019t the biggest mess he\u2019d ever made...So Tony had to clean it up now. The suit he\u2019d made in Afghanistan was perfect. He just needed to refine it with proper equipment now.\nThe CIA hadn\u2019t been...sure of the idea, but they hadn\u2019t been totally against it either.\nTony knew they were more concerned about a civilian putting himself into the line of fire. On the other hand, they\u2019d been talking to him for three years. They\u2019d seen him put himself out in order to personally capture the Black Widow, one of the most deadly assassins in the world at the time. They knew they couldn\u2019t stop him, and there was no law expressly prohibiting him from taking responsibility for his weapons ending up in terrorist hands.\nThey did have stipulations that he would please get someone else a suit if he was going through with this \u2013 someone who preferably was not a civilian. Tony\u2019s suggestion of Rhodey had been approved. So, first Tony would design his own suit, and then he\u2019d design a more user-friendly one for his best friend.\nSo Tony started work.\n\u2018JARVIS, you up?\u2019 he asked.\n\u2018For you, sir, always.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019d like to open a new project file. Index is Mark II.\u2019\n\u2018Shall I store this on the Stark Industries central database?\u2019\n\u2018Forget it. I don\u2019t know who to trust right now. Til further notice, why don\u2019t we just keep everything on my private server?\u2019\n\u2018Working on a secret project, are we, sir?\u2019\n\u2018Don\u2019t want this to wind up in the wrong hands.\u2019 Tony manipulated the hologram in front of him. \u2018Maybe mine, but it could actually do some good.\u2019\nOver the next few weeks, Tony worked tirelessly. He perfected his work and tested his creations. He ended up with a lot of bruises and scrapes. But he was trying to build an extremely sophisticated suit. The wires running through it had to be like the nerves of a human body. They had to respond to threats if the armour itself was ever pierced. It had to be able to endure all manner of artillery.\nAfghanistan\nObadiah viewed the plans in interest, tuning out Raza with mild disinterest. It looked simple enough to put together. If this took Tony three months in a cave with a box of scraps, it ought to take them even less time. This would be the perfect weapon and HYDRA would greatly benefit from this business.\nHonestly, Obadiah should have had the boy killed back when he\u2019d had his parents killed. It would have been easy to step up and become CEO of the company then. All he would have needed was to get all three Starks travelling somewhere together and they all would have died.\n(But Tony was younger than his parents \u2013 fitter. Who was to say he wouldn\u2019t have managed to save all three of them?)\nTony had been a teenager, just a child. He might\u2019ve run, Obie knew but he doubted it. For all his flippant attitude, Tony was just not the kind of boy who would abandon his parents, or indeed anyone, to an assassin \u2013 not even to save his own life. Tony would have died with them and he wouldn\u2019t have this problem now.\n(But Howard always carried tools in his back seat, where Tony would have been sitting. There\u2019s nothing saying he wouldn\u2019t have grabbed one and used it to disable the Asset\u2019s metal arm. If not for that, the Starks would have had an actual hope of surviving.)\nBut, at the same time, if Tony died back then, they wouldn\u2019t have this weapon now.\n\u2018Mr. Stane.\u2019\nObadiah turned around. Raza was dead on the ground, his neck snapped. Obie smiled. \u2018We\u2019ll build this,\u2019 he said, \u2018and then take Tony Stark out with his own invention.\u2019\n\u2018And Pepper Potts?\u2019\nObie nodded, somewhat regretful. \u2018It\u2019s a pity he had to involve her. I would have preferred she lived.\u2019\nMalibu, America\nPepper walked down into the workshop with a box and a mug of coffee for Tony. He was doing something or other. She\u2019d been notified by JARVIS about the power-suit Tony was refining. She didn\u2019t like the idea, but she couldn\u2019t exactly argue with his reasoning. He and his father had made a mess, no matter how unwittingly, and now it was Tony\u2019s responsibility to clean it up. At least there were plans for Rhodey to get one too. Tony would have someone they all trusted to watch his back. \u2018How\u2019s it going? That looks kinda dangerous.\u2019\n\u2018This is a flight stabiliser,\u2019 Tony said. He hit a button. \u2018It\u2019s completely harmless.\u2019\nSuddenly the stabiliser activated and Tony was thrown back. Pepper spun around and blocked her ears. She turned back around when the crashing noises stopped. Tony was lying, dazed, in a series of collapsed shelves.\n\u2018I was not expecting that,\u2019 he said.\n\u2018Are you okay?\u2019\n\u2018Yeah, yeah.\u2019 Tony stumbled to his feet. \u2018Did you need me for something?\u2019\n\u2018Well, the military found out about this suit thing.\u2019 Pepper shrugged. \u2018I guess the CIA reported it to them. They want to know why only one suit for one pilot.\u2019\n\u2018Tell them I\u2019m extremely paranoid about my stuff being misused, so the only pilot is going to be someone I trust. If Rhodey wasn\u2019t in the military, they wouldn\u2019t be getting a suit at all.\u2019\nPepper nodded.\nTony was walking back into the workshop with an icepack pressed to his head. He walked past the table and picked up the coffee mug. He took a drink...and paused. What was in the box? Pepper had brought in a box with the coffee, and he\u2019d only just noticed the note on top that said \u201cFor Tony\u201d. Reaching over, Tony pulled the note from the top and unwrapped the brown paper to find a glass display box. Inside was his old reactor. Pepper had had it framed and boxed. Around the edge, she\u2019d left a message.\n\nProof that Tony Stark has a heart.\n\nA slow smile crept onto Tony\u2019s face. She\u2019d been utterly disgusted in having to help him swap the two reactors over. He\u2019d told her to toss this one, but instead she\u2019d had it set in glass. Trust Pepper to set something up like this and unexpectedly make him feel better about what he was doing.\nTony picked up the old Arc Reactor and carried it to the edge of the workshop, where it was less likely to get knocked by something and damaged. With brand new vigour in his step, he got back to work. The suit was almost ready for its first field test. And then he could start working on Rhodey\u2019s suit.\n***\n\u2018They say these new radar technologies are superior to the human eye,\u2019 Rhodey said to a group of young cadets. It hadn\u2019t passed his notice that they were all African-American like him. He didn\u2019t know if command did that to make them feel more comfortable or if there was some unconscious racism happening somewhere in the workings of the brass. \u2018But in my experience, nothing beats the pilot\u2019s instincts and intuition.\u2019\nNoticing Tony had walked in and was wandering over, Rhodey quickly set them to work on their training and turned to meet his friend. \u2018Hey, man. You\u2019re looking better.\u2019\n\u2018Thanks,\u2019 Tony said. \u2018How\u2019re things from your end?\u2019\n\u2018Military\u2019s a bit grumpy, but everyone\u2019s pitching in to find how the weapons are being stolen despite the security.\u2019 Rhodey raised his eyebrows. \u2018So, what\u2019s this I hear about a power-suit?\u2019\n\u2018We gotta come up with a better name for that,\u2019 Tony said.\nRhodey chuckled. \u2018So how\u2019s it going?\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ve got the Mark II finished,\u2019 Tony said. \u2018I just gotta give it a few test runs so I can iron out the kinks. Then I can work on yours.\u2019\n\u2018Sweet.\u2019 Rhodey chuckled. \u2018Brass is still annoyed about the \u201cone suit\u201d thing, but you know. They\u2019re also annoyed about the \u201cone Captain Marvel\u201d thing.\u2019\nTony grinned. \u2018So how is Carol?\u2019\nRhodey pressed his lips together. \u2018We\u2019re just friends, Tony. Like you and Pepper.\u2019\nTony gave him a sceptical look but dropped it. \u2018I hear something about her shooting into the upper atmosphere?\u2019\n\u2018Read, you mean.\u2019 Rhodey rolled his eyes good-naturedly. \u2018It\u2019s a bit hush-hush, but I guess it\u2019s more of those things they call a Situation 51.\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s a bit unoriginal, isn\u2019t it?\u2019\nRhodey laughed.\n***\nTony had taken to reading his father\u2019s files in his downtime. Because of how little of that he had, he was still working through them. He sat at his computers, looking for an unchecked file. He found one that got his interest: CORE AGENT PROGRAM. Clicking on it, Tony suddenly found his screens filled with the profiles of about 15 female agents.\nA typed-up message appeared on the screen in front of him.\n\nPeg once would have considered this detestable, Tony; something that didn\u2019t even bear thinking. As she got older, though, she became more and more ruthless and unscrupulous. I remained blind to it, until she expressed interest in you.\n\n\nIn this file are 15 girls that Peg had trained from diapers to be her most powerful agents.\n\n\nMost of these little girls were the daughters, nieces, or family friends of agents who Peg could talk into it. A few were just little orphaned or abandoned girls that S.H.I.E.L.D. found on the street. Those that had parents who would miss them...well, those parents were told that their daughters were attending gymnastics or ballet class. The girls were taught to call it that too.\n\n\nIt was Peg\u2019s answer to the Black Widow Program.\n\n\nShe told herself she was better because she wasn\u2019t taking these girls away from their parents; she wasn\u2019t killing anyone to cover it up. She told herself that she was better because they still had a normal childhood \u2013 given a certain definition of normal. Those of us who wouldn\u2019t let our kids anywhere close to her all kept quiet for the same reason.\n\n\nThe pride of the bunch was Agent 13. Peg\u2019s niece through her brother \u2013 Sharon Carter.\n\n***\nObadiah Stane glared in frustration at the behemoth in front of him. The shell was fine. The wiring was fine. There was just one admittedly large problem. He turned on the engineer and towered over him. \u2018Tony Stark built this and got it working in a cave \u2013 WITH A BOX OF SCRAPS!\u2019\n\u2018Well, I\u2019m not Tony Stark,\u2019 the engineer said. \u2018If you could get it near an Arc Reactor I\u2019m sure it would work, but it needs a power source.\u2019\nArc Reactor...well, that gave him two options.\n***\nTony stepped into his house, a wide grin on his face.\nHe knew going to that party would be a good idea. He hadn\u2019t been expecting to see Pepper, but she\u2019d given him the perfect excuse to ditch S.H.I.E.L.D.\u2019s favourite lackey, Coulson, and avoid his questioning. Apparently, the guy couldn\u2019t take a hint. Funny. Tony had thought \u201cpiss off\u201d was hint enough. Pepper had been reluctant to dance with him, until she\u2019d seen Coulson and realised why he was asking her to dance. Then she went with him.\nFollowing that had been an amusing conversation on his social security number. They\u2019d then escaped to the balcony, leading to the event that had pasted this silly grin on his face.\nPepper had nearly kissed him!\nFunny, he\u2019d never had this reaction to an actual kiss. He was a playboy, for crying out loud! He had his fun and then he moved on. In this case, though, it was Pepper. She\u2019d stood by his side for ten years. She\u2019d supported him through countless bouts of childish petulance and reluctance, and through the events that had changed his life.\nTony plopped down onto his couch.\nOdds were Pepper wouldn\u2019t believe Tony was really interested. She never had before \u2013 not that he\u2019d tried very hard since the early days. Convincing her he was would take time. The first step, of course, would be giving up his playboy lifestyle. No more dates, no more one-night stands. Just cut all that out and send the message that he was ready for a committed relationship.\nFive months ago, the thought would have terrified him. Now...it didn\u2019t seem too bad. He thought back to the relationship his parents had. Even back then, Tony had denied his father loved him but he never denied he loved his mother. From information Tony had found out, his dad had been the same back in his youth. It gave that last conversation a whole new angle.\n\n\u2018Be nice, dear. He\u2019s been studying abroad.\u2019\n\n\n\u2018Really? Which broad? What\u2019s her name?\u2019\n\nWas that his father attempting to connect with him in the scant few minutes he actually had?\nJARVIS suddenly spoke up, instantly yanking Tony from the metaphorical Cloud 9. \u2018Sir, it appears someone is attempting to hack my servers. Instigating Protocol 3.\u2019 Then he went silent.\nTony was on his feet in an instant. Protocol 3 would go out instantly, but it would take time for anyone to arrive \u2013 especially at this time of night. Call it paranoia, but Tony walked to a personalised cubby hole and pulled the gun out from inside. Quickly checking the gun, Tony moved around to a higher vantage point.\nWas it S.H.I.E.L.D.? Was Coulson trying to break in with a bunch of agents? They seemed the most likely candidates for this. On the other hand, there was one other enemy that Tony had out there \u2013 well, he was connected to a much larger group, but still...He was a possibility too. So Tony waited, hoping to God that this invader would try and sneak in through the doors and not the windows.\nWhen he came in, Tony saw he had nothing to worry about. The fat oaf wouldn\u2019t have a hope in hell of getting up to the window, never mind in through it. Tony aimed his gun and cocked it, drawing the invader\u2019s attention up to him. The wide-eyed shock was very satisfying to look at. It was amazing. All these years, and the idiot still underestimated him.\n\u2018Hello, Obie. You forget how to use the doorbell?\u2019\n\u2018Tony,\u2019 he said, a flash of annoyance crossing his face. \u2018I thought you\u2019d be down here.\u2019\n\u2018Obviously.\u2019 Tony inclined his head. \u2018So, tell me something Obie. How did you get out?\u2019\n\u2018I have friends, Tony.\u2019\n\u2018So you are fully affiliated with HYDRA.\u2019 Tony slid his free hand into his pocket. \u2018It wasn\u2019t a one-time thing.\u2019\n\u2018No, we made an agreement years ago.\u2019\nTony\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u2018And Afghanistan? Don\u2019t happen to have any idea what happened there, do you?\u2019\nStane smiled, in an extremely unsettling way. \u2018We\u2019d been watching you ever since you ousted me. Afghanistan was the perfect moment to strike. All I wanted was a chance for some revenge. I couldn\u2019t take control of the company anymore \u2013 Pepper certainly proved that \u2013 but I could still destroy you.\u2019\nHe was being very liberal with his information. Made Tony think there was someone sneaking up behind him.\n\u2018And what did HYDRA get out of me getting killed in Afghanistan?\u2019\n\u2018They had an interest in your company. It\u2019s a pity you had to involve Pepper.\u2019\nTony\u2019s hand tightened around the gun. \u2018What about Pepper?\u2019\nThe next thing he knew, there was a sharp sting, most notably in his chest. Then he was suddenly face-down on the floor, body aching like when he was refining the suit. Even with the sudden shift, Tony knew what had happened. He\u2019d been zapped from behind. It\u2019d not only sent him flying but also affected the Arc Reactor for a second. But Tony was an engineer and he\u2019d thought of that. That was why this Arc Reactor had a kind of defibrillator that restarted his heart if anything stopped it.\nBut, in the meantime, Tony had to recover from his short cardiac arrest.\nStane was rushing at him, aiming for the Arc Reactor. He wouldn\u2019t get it. Sure enough, he felt the watch in his wrist vibrate slightly as it recognised violent intent and the pulse activated. Stane barely got close enough to get to the Arc Reactor when he was suddenly thrown back and across the room. His hand had definitely been going for Tony\u2019s chest. Tony\u2019s mind rushed over the possibilities and landed on the only reasonable conclusion. He watched Stane through slitted eyelids as he was helped to his feet by some other guys in camouflage gear \u2013 HYDRA, I bet.\n\u2018What the hell was that?\u2019 Stane demanded.\n\u2018It happened to Romanoff too,\u2019 one of the other men said. \u2018He must be wearing something.\u2019\nTony didn\u2019t worry about them thinking of the wristwatch. Tony had always worn them and it was done so much it was clich\u00e9d. Stane would consider it to be something much smaller. He almost smirked when he heard Stane say exactly that. But Tony was pretending to be unconscious or dead \u2013 he wasn\u2019t sure which. People often did dumb things without thinking about it, and these types would just say \u201cwhoops\u201d if they accidentally killed someone.\n\u2018Ah, don\u2019t worry about it.\u2019 The guy waved it off. \u2018We can just use the one at the factory. The suit\u2019s there anyway.\u2019\nTony quickly calculated where they would have to have been working in the factory to have been in there without anyone noticing and notifying him.\n\u2018Someone\u2019s coming in!\u2019 Another man ran into Tony\u2019s line of sight. \u2018We\u2019ve gotta go.\u2019\nStane moved off first. \u2018Make sure you don\u2019t leave Tony alive.\u2019\nTony would have smirked. He knew if they went to use their guns, JARVIS would fry them. Protocol 3 had him appear to be shut down while he notified a list of people to the home invasion and ensure Tony\u2019s safety until the authorities could arrive. As JARVIS didn\u2019t, he assumed the one left behind to \u201ctake care of him\u201d had picked up the gun Tony had been holding.\n\u2018What?\u2019 The guy suddenly began cursing the gun. \u2018Oh, fuck this!\u2019 The weapon hit the floor.\nSuddenly, JARVIS shot. The guy cried out and went flying. Chest still aching, Tony pushed himself up. He looked at the guy, who was now completely stunned. \u2018Nice design, isn\u2019t it? I put a DNA reader in the trigger so if anyone else tried to use it against me, the trigger would lock up.\u2019\nThat was how he\u2019d refined the security of the suit.\nThe doors opened and the FBI streamed in, followed by Rhodey. The agents surrounded the HYDRA grunt and held him at gunpoint. Rhodey rushed over. \u2018Tony, are you okay?\u2019\nTony spun around. \u2018Where\u2019s Pepper?\u2019 he demanded.\n\u2018She\u2019s fine,\u2019 Rhodey said. \u2018She\u2019s taking some agents to the factory so they can slip in quietly and surprise them.\u2019\nTony pressed his lips together. \u2018That\u2019s not gonna be enough.\u2019\n***\n\u2018So that\u2019s it?\u2019 Rhodey asked as the bots put the suit onto Tony.\n\u2018My one,\u2019 Tony said. \u2018I\u2019ve tested everything else except how battle-ready it is. I guess this\u2019ll have to be that test.\u2019\n\u2018You sure?\u2019\n\u2018Positive.\u2019\n\u2018How\u2019d he manage to build his own suit anyway?\u2019\n\u2018Only way I can think is if he got his hands on my schematics for the rudimentary one Carol found me in.\u2019\nThe helmet slid over Tony\u2019s face and he took off.\n***\nPepper moved quickly, leading the FBI agents to the factory. She slid her key card across the access panel and the door opened. As she led them through the quiet building she was unconsciously thinking the same thing that Tony was. The only reasonable place for Stane to be was an area of the factory that had been under renovations. For some reason, it hadn\u2019t been touched in two or three months.\nWith a company as big as SI, and his own project, Tony hadn\u2019t stopped to check on it and see why nothing was happening. It was now clear they should have done it long ago. Pepper led the FBI agents through the renovation area and saw it really hadn\u2019t been touched. Beyond it, she was hardly surprised to see a fully set-up lab. For now, it was quiet and dark.\nThe agents passed her and began looking around, guns drawn and movements cautious. Pepper let her eyes drift across this lab that should not be here. Her eyes were drawn to a dark corner. The hairs on the back of her neck stood on end. There was something there. One of the FBI agents noticed where she was looking. He pulled a flashlight from what Pepper expected was a hidden utility belt and flicked it on, pointing it at the dark corner.\nThere was something there. It was...it was a behemoth. There was no other way to describe it. The eyes lit up and it surged forward. Pepper felt herself pushed towards the door as the agents all turned their guns on the behemoth. She ran. She knew it wasn\u2019t her place now. She was a civilian and this was a danger-zone. She was best to get out of the area.As she stumbled out of the door from the factory, though, she heard a loud crash. The behemoth that no doubt contained Obadiah Stane landed heavily in front of her, blocking her path. Pepper gasped and stumbled back. Her heart felt like it was pounding in her throat as one of the arms lifted and pointed at her. A repulsor began to glow in the barrel mounted to the top of it.\n\u2018Miss Potts,\u2019 Stane\u2019s voice came out, distorted by the speaker, \u2018you\u2019re fired!\u2019\nThe specially-made watch on Pepper\u2019s wrist began to vibrate. But could the watch emit its pulse before the repulsor beam was released. The distinction between the two alternatives sent her heart skyrocketing even further.\nPepper\u2019s panic was cut off when something suddenly sailed into the behemoth and threw it away from her. She watched as a much smaller, but much more agile, suit began to engage the behemoth in combat. That must be Tony! The thought didn\u2019t sit well with her.\nTony, in the red and gold smaller suit, drew Stane up the side of the factory. Despite the fact that he had to know the FBI had already had the area evacuated and blocked off the roads to and past the company, Tony was making extra sure no one would get hit by drawing Stane up to the roof.\nIn the meantime, Pepper\u2019s heart was slowly calming down. Adrenalin was still pumping through her veins as she tried to wrap her head around the fact that she had nearly been killed. She was half-convinced she had just had a heart attack as she staggered backwards until she hit a wall. Now she had a completely different reason to worry.\n\nTony...\n\nTony landed on the factory roof.\nStane landed right behind him. He turned around and the billionaire watched in mild amusement, but mostly irritation, as a hatch opened and a small missile flicked out. It was things like that which really showed why people needed Starks to do their dirty work. Incompetent twits. Tony dodged the missile launched at him by Stane\u2019s copycat armour and activated the repulsors and hovered overhead.\n\u2018Impressive!\u2019 Stane bellowed from where he stood on the top of the factory. \u2018You\u2019ve upgraded your armour! I\u2019ve made some upgrades of my own!\u2019\nThe metal creaked and clanged as it shifted and moved. Steam shot out from his feet and he lifted into the air. As the steam shot out, it covered the area in a thick fog-like density. He lifted into the air slowly. It seemed by turning the original into that heavy monstrosity, he had traded in speed for strength.\n\u2018Sir, it appears that his suit can fly,\u2019 JARVIS said.\n\u2018Duly noted.\u2019 It was time to see what other weaknesses it had \u2013 besides the obvious. \u2018Take me to maximum altitude.\u2019\nThe suit flew up. Stane followed him. Tony was surprised, however, when Stane passed the 200-meter mark from the top of the factory. Actually, it was 200.64 meters. The jets on the behemoth\u2019s feet flashed once and then spluttered out. Stane\u2019s suit suddenly dropped down, plummeting back to the factory roof. That\u2019d leave a sizable dent for him to have repaired later.\n\u2018JARVIS, what just happened?\u2019 Tony asked, stopping in midair and turning around.\n\u2018Scanning.\u2019 Jarvis didn\u2019t take long. \u2018It appears his suit is powered by the Arc Reactor in the factory, sir. As he came out of range, he lost power.\u2019\n\u2018Huh.\u2019 Tony was amused, he\u2019d say. \u2018He hasn\u2019t tested it, has he?\u2019 And he didn\u2019t trust Stane down there by himself. He began to descend himself.\n\u2018It would seem not, sir.\u2019\nTony landed on the roof and looked around. The scanners quickly located Stane\u2019s suit. He was out of earshot as he waited for the suit to charge up again, using the Arc Reactor. That would explain why he\u2019d tried to steal Tony\u2019s Reactor. He\u2019d wanted a mobile power source. As it so happened, Obadiah was purely a businessman. He may have thought he had the weapon, but it was only as good as its energy source.\n\u2018JARIVS,\u2019 Tony said, \u2018get ready to switch the factory to emergency back-up power.\u2019 He then shifted to Pepper\u2019s Bluetooth. \u2018Potts.\u2019\n\u2018Tony!\u2019 Pepper sounded relieved. \u2018Oh, my God! Are you...Are you okay?\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m fine,\u2019 Tony said. \u2018Listen, I just found out how Stane\u2019s suit is working. He\u2019s using the big Arc Reactor in the factory. He\u2019s recharging now, so I don\u2019t have long. The good news is he can\u2019t go far beyond 200 meters of the Reactor.\u2019 He smiled to himself as he heard Pepper speak to someone else.\n\u2018So what are you going to do?\u2019 She spoke into the Bluetooth again.\n\u2018Know what happens when you overload a machine\u2019s power source?\u2019\n\u2018It fries the circuits?\u2019\n\u2018It fries the circuits.\u2019 The readings flashed across the screen. \u2018Hold on, he\u2019s coming again.\u2019\n\u2018Tony!\u2019 Pepper\u2019s cry was drowned out by Stane jumping up in his suit and bellowing, \u2018Nice try!\u2019\nTony spun around and shot a repulsor blast at him and, as it hit, Stane\u2019s armour stumbled back. Leaping forward, Tony punched Stane\u2019s suit in the mask. It was far too large for Stane\u2019s head to be there, but he needed to break that thing \u2013 that was not even mentioning the glaring weakness in the suit.\nSuddenly the behemoth\u2019s hands closed around Tony, catching him in a crushing grip. Tony struggled for a moment. However, his suit had been designed for all kinds of pressure. Stane had obviously built his for strength and strength alone. Its endurance wouldn\u2019t be too good. Tony lifted a hand to the mask and pushed. In the arms, he had a series of weapons which would screw up Stane\u2019s interface.\nSparks flew and Stane only managed to hold on for a fraction of a second before he was forced to let go as his own interface turned on him. Tony bounded out of his grip as Stane groaned in annoyance and shook his head. He soon seemed to recover himself. \u2018Very clever, Tony.\u2019\nTony peered around the corner he\u2019d slipped behind. He reinitiated contact with Pepper. \u2018Potts.\u2019 He kept his voice at a whisper so Stane wouldn\u2019t hear him.\n\u2018Tony!\u2019 her voice came through the receiver again.\n\u2018We\u2019re gonna have to overload the reactor and fry all of Stane\u2019s circuits,\u2019 Tony told her. \u2018With the place surrounded as it is, Stane won\u2019t be able to get away again.\u2019\n\u2018Well, how are you gonna do that?\u2019 Pepper asked.\n\u2018You\u2019re gonna do it,\u2019 Tony said. \u2018Go to the central console. Open up all the circuits. When I get clear, I\u2019ll let you know, and you\u2019re gonna hit the master bypass button. It\u2019ll fry him, and everything up here.\u2019\n\u2018Is he gonna die?\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s a possibility.\u2019\nThere was a little more muttering on the other end of the line and Tony guessed she was talking to the FBI agents about the plan. The next thing he heard from her was, \u2018Okay...I\u2019m going in now.\u2019\n\u2018Make sure you wait until I\u2019m clear from the rooftop,\u2019 Tony said, moving away as Stane came closer.\nStane looked around the corner as Tony slipped behind him. Then Tony leapt onto his back. His hand wrapped around the cord that was the suit\u2019s most glaring weakness. Stane growled as he tried to shake him off. But he was a massive, slow-moving behemoth. It was easy for Tony to keep his balance. Sorry, Obie, he thought insincerely. Rule one of engineering: never leave wires exposed. \u2018This looks important.\u2019 He yanked the cord out, tearing wires along with it.\nStane\u2019s mechanical hand wrapped around Tony\u2019s head and threw him from his back. The helmet came off \u2013 luckily, or he\u2019d be dead. Tony slid across the glass ceiling of the main control room and looked down. Pepper was doing exactly what he\u2019d told her to do. There were federal agents standing on the periphery of the room. The mechanical whirring made Tony look up again and he saw Stane was opening the suit so that he could see again.\n\u2018I never had a taste for this sort of thing!\u2019 he called across to him. \u2018But I must admit, I\u2019m deeply enjoying the suit!\u2019 He crushed Tony\u2019s helmet and tossed it down by Tony\u2019s hand. Tony looked down at the helmet and then back up at Stane as he stomped along towards him. \u2018You finally outdid yourself, Tony. You\u2019ve made your father proud!\u2019\nTony\u2019s mind flashed back to Howard. A hundred things Tony had been too young, too naive, too ignorant to understand. The love he\u2019d never seen as a child was now palpable as an adult. My father, he thought, pushing himself up, was proud of me from the day I was born. He glanced down through the glass as Pepper\u2019s voice still reached him.\n\u2018It\u2019s ready, Tony! Get off the roof!\u2019\nStane extended an arm and released machine gun fire on him. Tony lifted his arm, and two panels extended outwards, protecting his head from the bullets. But Stane wasn\u2019t aiming for him. The glass beneath him shattered and gravity took hold. Tony only just barely managed to catch himself on the framing of the glass ceiling. Pepper screamed as the glass fell over her. Tony hauled himself up.\nHe briefly considered shooting away, but he couldn\u2019t leave Pepper here by herself. Stane decided to then shoot the rest of the glass out. Tony didn\u2019t know whether he knew Pepper was down there and was trying to scare her away, or if he was just trying to scare Tony as much as he could before he killed him. Pepper didn\u2019t scream this time. She just covered her head. There was so much noise, Tony didn\u2019t know if she even made a sound.\n\u2018Tony!\u2019 Pepper called.\nStane apparently didn\u2019t hear her. \u2018How ironic, Tony!\u2019\nTony looked back up at him, trying to work out what he was talking about.\n\u2018Don\u2019t think I didn\u2019t notice what you were doing!\u2019 Stane called. \u2018Trying to rid the world of your father\u2019s weapons, you gave it its best one ever!\u2019\n\u2018Pepper!\u2019 Tony called for her to hit the button.\nOr maybe Stane just didn\u2019t care. \u2018And now...I\u2019m gonna kill you with it!\u2019 Stane fired a missile.\nTony flinched away, but it was a horrible miss.\n\u2018You ripped out my targeting system.\u2019\nWas it his fault Stane was an idiot? Not that he was complaining. That meant Stane would have to get closer. Tony called down again as Stane began that expected advance. \u2018Time to hit the button!\u2019\nHe saw Pepper step up to the button and look up at him. \u2018You told me not to!\u2019\n\u2018Hold still, you little prick!\u2019 Stane tried again. And missed again.\n\u2018Just do it!\u2019 Tony yelled.\n\u2018You\u2019ll die!\u2019 Pepper yelled back.\nStane fired again, missed again. This one was closer though. Tony dropped down, hanging by one arm. \u2018Push it!\u2019\nPepper hit the button. She covered her head and ran. The Arc Reactor began to overload. Electricity sparked out of the machine and snaked its way through the entire room. Tony hauled himself up again and jammed his eyes shut, waiting to see if he would live or die. His body was suddenly propelled up and Obadiah Stane screamed. He then slumped forward and fell into the hole he made. The whole thing came apart as he plummeted into the core of the Arc Reactor. A fiery explosion followed and Tony flinched away. He felt himself slipping into unconsciousness but one thing pulled him back.\n\u2018Tony!\u2019\n\nPepper...\n\n\u2018Miss Potts.\u2019\nPepper turned and frowned when she saw who was approaching her. \u2018Mr. Coulson, this area is restricted.\u2019\n\u2018I need to speak to Tony Stark,\u2019 Coulson said with an air of assumed authority.\nPepper blocked his way. The words on his profile rang in her mind: sociopathic, detached personality. There was nothing really proving it, but the behavioural patterns pointed in that direction. She folded her arms and tapped a button on her watch as she did so. Over the years, as he found out more about S.H.I.E.L.D., Tony had added a few more features on the watch \u2013 such as a security call button. \u2018If so, you\u2019ll need to make an appointment.\u2019\nCoulson didn\u2019t even look annoyed. \u2018I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t have time, Miss Potts. I need to speak with Mr. Stark right now.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re overstepping your authority, Mr. Coulson,\u2019 Pepper fired back with all the professional coldness that had made her so feared and respected in the industry by Tony\u2019s business associates and rivals alike. \u2018Mr. Stark has just fought off a third attempt on his life and he won\u2019t be amicable to S.H.I.E.L.D. entering his buildings without using the proper channels.\u2019\nCoulson gave something like a friendly smile that looked a bit nervous. \u2018I\u2019m sorry, Miss Potts.\u2019\nPepper felt the watch on her wrist vibrate and then she turned her head as two men were thrown back by the pulse. She had been expecting something like that. She looked back at Coulson as the security guards entered the hall behind him, led by Happy. Finally, there was emotion on his face: shock. He twisted his face as the guards grabbed his arm. Pepper watched as he was escorted out of the building by the guards. A couple of more came in to deal with Coulson\u2019s men. Pepper turned and continued on her way.\n\u2018You all right, Pep?\u2019 Happy asked.\n\u2018I\u2019m more worried about Tony, honestly,\u2019 Pepper said. \u2018I think we\u2019re doing this too soon.\u2019\nHappy nodded. \u2018Well, the sooner we get it done, the sooner it\u2019ll be over with.\u2019\nPepper nodded and moved on.\n***\nTony was scanning through the paper. He liked the front page, mind. \u2018Iron Man. I like it. Strictly speaking, it\u2019s not iron though. It\u2019s a gold-titanium alloy. But Iron Man...I like it. It\u2019s catchy.\u2019 He closed the paper and looked up at Pepper who was currently covering up his wounds from the previous night with make-up. \u2018So what did the feds say?\u2019\n\u2018They agree with you on the matter,\u2019 Pepper said. \u2018Apparently, the public loving to hate you makes you a special case. You\u2019ve been making all this noise about cleaning up your own mess. If they don\u2019t see you personally stepping up, you\u2019ll get called all-talk. If you do show that you\u2019re actively doing something about it by being Iron Man, though, they won\u2019t have anything to pick on. PR agrees with them, strangely enough.\u2019\n\u2018Stocks?\u2019\nPepper nodded. \u2018You\u2019d think the quality of your tech would be enough to kill that, but our stock-holders apparently want to see the CEO holding himself accountable to the company.\u2019 She stepped back. \u2018Make-up\u2019s done.\u2019\nTony stood up and Pepper helped him into his suit jacket. \u2018You know, I finally found out why they called my mom a trophy wife.\u2019\n\u2018Really?\u2019 Pepper asked, brushing off his shoulders. \u2018Why\u2019s that?\u2019\n\u2018Dad used to sleep around as much as I do,\u2019 Tony said. \u2018Mom was always figured as just the woman he decided to settle down with when his looks started to go.\u2019 He turned around to find Pepper\u2019s eyebrows had climbed up to her hairline.\n\u2018Is that what you\u2019re gonna do?\u2019 she asked, straightening his tie.\n\u2018I said that was what they thought,\u2019 Tony said. \u2018Never said I believed it. I think dad just got sick of sleeping around.\u2019\n\u2018Why do you say that?\u2019\n\u2018Because I\u2019m starting to.\u2019\nPepper paused, but only for a second. \u2018Are you sure that\u2019s got nothing to do with the Reactor in your chest?\u2019\n\u2018It might. I don\u2019t know.\u2019 Tony smiled at her. \u2018Guess we\u2019ll find out, won\u2019t we?\u2019\nPepper smiled and dropped her eyes. She made a show of checking his cufflinks. Tony smiled as he watched her. There was a knock on the door and they both turned. Happy stuck his head in. \u2018You\u2019re on, boss.\u2019\n\u2018All right.\u2019 Tony reluctantly stepped away from Pepper. \u2018Let\u2019s get this over with then.\u2019\nPepper handed him a pair of sunglasses and he flicked them on. He walked out and past Happy. The camera flashes immediately began. Tony walked over to the podium. He leaned on the lectern and waited for the flashes to die down. \u2018Good morning. I\u2019m glad to see such a turn-out. Of course, I imagine you\u2019re all anxious to hear about the Iron Man that was seen fighting at my factory last night\u2014Don\u2019t interrupt me, Miss Everhart. I\u2019m about to explain it.\u2019\nChristine Everhart shut her mouth with a displeased twist of the lips.\n\u2018When I escaped from captivity in Afghanistan a few months ago, I did so by building a rudimentary suit of armour with a flamethrower and low-level flight capability,\u2019 Tony explained. \u2018I made coded plans which only contained half of what I was doing and, quite regrettably, I had to leave it in the cave. It turned out that my captors were working in conjunction with my former business partner, Obadiah Stane, who took the plans and made a rather crude version of the suit.\u2019 Tony twisted his lips. \u2018The red and gold suit you saw was my own refined version. Last night, Mr. Stane made a second, and then a third attempt on my life. The fight on the roof of the factory was the third attempt.\u2019\n\u2018Does this mean that you were there?\u2019 one journalist called.\n\u2018Of course,\u2019 Tony said. \u2018Iron Man is me.\u2019\nThe room exploded with questions.\nTony raised his hands. \u2018Easy! One at a time, ladies and gentlemen! I am trying for transparency here. I will also ask you to sit and listen to the rest of this before the floor opens for questions.\u2019\nThe journalists sat back down and quietened.\nTony went back into his speech. \u2018When I returned to the States, I expressed my desire to refine the suit I\u2019d invented in Afghanistan and use it to remove my weapons from the illegal hands they have fallen into. The FBI and CIA agreed on the condition that I create another suit for the use of someone who is not a civilian, like myself. I have chosen, for this, Lt. Col. James Rhodes.\u2019 He clapped Rhodey on the shoulder. \u2018That suit is under construction but, based on the fact that Mr. Stane had threatened the safety of my employees in the factory, I took mine for its first field test run last night, as I knew Mr. Stane had a similar suit.\u2019 He paused. \u2018The floor is now open for questions.\u2019\nHands shot up like lightning.\nThis was gonna be a long press conference.\n***\n\u2018...So, just like that,\u2019 Carol said, \u2018Stane\u2019s actions showed the military why you\u2019re being so picky with who uses the suit.\u2019 She took a bite of pizza. \u2018The sort of damage he did when he was limited to a particular area scared them \u2013 especially considering how much more damage could have been done with a mobile power source.\u2019\nRhodey nodded. \u2018So it did HYDRA more harm than good. If he\u2019d have survived, I doubt they\u2019d have hauled him out again.\u2019\n\u2018How\u2019d you two get out of trouble for that, by the way?\u2019 Happy asked.\n\u2018Apparently, Stane was too dangerous anyway,\u2019 Tony said. \u2018He tried to kill the same person three times, he was a psychopath on a power-trip, and he was dealing with terrorists. The big guns had decided he was safer if he was dead anyway. If he survived, they were going to slide him into a court that would\u2019ve sentenced him to death. We saved them the trouble, so they just swept the whole thing under the rug and called it an accident.\u2019\nRhodey chuckled. \u2018Intelligence agencies!\u2019\n\u2018Well, at least they would\u2019ve given him a fair trial,\u2019 Carol remarked. \u2018Hell, a trial at all! We\u2019ve already removed 239 people from S.H.I.E.L.D.\u2019s custody who were never going to get one. Some had been in there for years. Mr. Murdock and Mr. Nelson have been a tremendous help in the circumstances.\u2019 She nodded to Tony. \u2018Nice job finding out about that, by the way.\u2019\nThe Raft. Yet another thing his father had left on the hard drive.\n\u2018How did the Raft work, by the way?\u2019 Pepper asked.\n\u2018It was in International waters,\u2019 Carol said. \u2018And it was sitting in a radar blind spot. If Howard hadn\u2019t put the coordinates down for Tony then we still might not know it exists.\u2019 She chuckled and shook her head. \u2018I think your father was in a tight spot. Anything he might do, or try to do, would endanger his family. Maybe that\u2019s why he raised you in the public eye. He was relying on you to put your foot down.\u2019\nTony smiled.\n2012 \u2013 4 Years Later \u2013 New York CityThe lights came on, displaying the massive \u201cSTARK\u201d across the side of the building.\n\u2018How\u2019s it look?\u2019 Pepper asked.\n\u2018Like Christmas, but with more...me.\u2019\n\u2018We\u2019ve gotta go wider on the Public Awareness Campaign. You need to do some press. I\u2019m in DC tomorrow, working on the zoning for the next two buildings.\u2019\n\u2018Pepper!\u2019 Tony groaned in annoyance. \u2018You\u2019re killing the moment! Remember? Enjoy the moment.\u2019\n\u2018Get in here and I will.\u2019\nTony landed on his new platform. As he walked along it, the robotic machine he\u2019d developed removed the suit from his body. As he did, JARVIS spoke up. \u2018Sir, you asked to be informed if S.H.I.E.L.D. began initiating their Avengers Initiative.\u2019\nThat had been something Tony had found from hacking. Just a month ago, Steve Rogers had been found in the Arctic \u2013 frozen but very much alive. He\u2019d been immediately scooped up by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. Tony hadn\u2019t been surprised, as they likely wanted to use him as a weapon. Time to see how good this \u201cinherent sense of right\u201d is, he\u2019d thought. Tony and JARVIS had kept an eye on the situation.\nRogers had been immediately added to a S.H.I.E.L.D. program called The Avengers Initiative. They\u2019d already picked out who they wanted \u2013 and Tony himself was on that list. It was also highly suspicious that the dear old Black Widow, Romanoff herself, was a member, along with the highest-clearance level sniper they had. What they were on the line-up for was clear as day.\nTony\u2019s main concern, upon seeing the line-up, was a particular civilian scientist.\n\u2018What\u2019s happened?\u2019 Tony asked.\n\u2018Agent Romanoff has been dispatched to retrieve Dr. Banner.\u2019\nThat was what he was afraid of. Tony frowned. \u2018Why now?\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m searching the records as we speak, sir.\u2019\n\u2018Keep me posted,\u2019 Tony stepped inside the penthouse and walked over to Pepper.\nPepper watched the readings intently. \u2018Levels are holding steady, I think.\u2019 She chewed her bottom lip.\n\u2018Of course they are. I was directly involved.\u2019 Tony walked over and tossed his earpiece on the table. \u2018Which brings me to my next question: how does it feel to be a genius?\u2019\n\u2018Well, I really wouldn\u2019t know, now, would I?\u2019 Pepper remarked, turning to face him.\n\u2018What do you mean?\u2019 Tony asked. \u2018All this...\u2019 He gestured with a circular motion of his forefinger. \u2018..came from you.\u2019\n\u2018No. All this came from that.\u2019 She tapped his Arc Reactor.\n\u2018Give yourself some credit,\u2019 Tony said. \u2018Please.\u2019 He rubbed her forearms. \u2018Stark Tower is your baby. Give yourself...12% of the credit.\u2019\n\u201812%?\u2019 Pepper\u2019s voice dropped into that \u201care you kidding me\u201d tone.\n\u2018An argument could be made for 15!\u2019 Tony quickly amended.\n\u201812%?\u2019 She scoffed as she walked over to the table where the champagne was waiting. \u2018My baby?\u2019\n\u2018Well, I did do all the heavy lifting.\u2019 Tony pointed out. \u2018Literally! I lifted the heavy things. And, sorry, but the security snafu \u2013 that was on me too\u2014\u2019\n\u2018Oh!\u2019 Pepper made an exaggerated sound as she pulled out the bottle of champagne.\n\u2018My private elevator!\u2019\nPepper poured out the champagne. \u2018You mean our elevator?\u2019\n\u2018It was teeming with sweaty workmen,\u2019 Tony pointed out. He sat down with her. \u2018I\u2019m going to pay for that comment about percentages in some subtle way later, aren\u2019t I?\u2019\nPepper handed him his glass. \u2018Not gonna be that subtle.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ll tell you what. Next building is gonna say \u201cPotts\u201d on the tower.\u2019\n\u2018On the lease.\u2019 They clinked their glasses.\n\u2018Call your mom. Can you bunk over?\u2019\nPepper laughed.\n\u2018Sir, I have the information you requested.\u2019 JARVIS suddenly interrupted them.\n\u2018Good,\u2019 Tony said.\n\u2018What happened?\u2019 Pepper asked.\n\u2018Our little spider went to retrieve Dr. Banner.\u2019\nPepper\u2019s expression darkened. \u2018Why?\u2019\n\u2018It seems that S.H.I.E.L.D. were building weapons with something called the Tesseract, a device of unknown origin...\u2019\nTony nodded. \u2018Yeah, I\u2019ve heard of it. Dad based the Arc Reactor off of it.\u2019 He scowled. \u2018Building weapons with it, huh? Last people who did that were the Nazis.\u2019\n\u2018Indeed, sir. A man identified as Loki appeared with a sceptre of some kind. He used it to put S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents Barton and Selvig into a sort of trance and stole the Tesseract to parts unknown. All data points to Director Fury having decided to activate the Avengers Initiative in order to retrieve it for his project.\u2019\n\u2018Naturally.\u2019 Tony huffed. \u2018Did you say \u201cLoki\u201d? As in \u201cNorse God of Mischief\u201d?\u2019\n\u2018It would appear so, sir. Two years ago, S.H.I.E.L.D. encountered Thor and Loki who, all evidence suggests, are from another dimension or realm. My conclusions are that the Norse Gods are really interdimensional beings who learned how to cross the barrier and were taken for Gods by primitive man.\u2019\nTony nodded. \u2018That makes a lot more sense than actual Gods.\u2019\n\u2018Yes, sir. I\u2019ve uploaded the data to your personal computer.\u2019\nTony sighed and stood up. Pepper followed as he walked over to the computer and accessed the files JARVIS had just added. Tony scanned through the data and then flicked the holographic screen out. Data on all six intended members, including Tony himself was displayed in front of them.\nTony looked over at Dr. Banner\u2019s file in particular.\n\u2018Why would they add a couple of professional killers to this team?\u2019 Pepper asked.\n\u2018To keep the rest of us under S.H.I.E.L.D.\u2019s control,\u2019 Tony said. \u2018One manipulates you to keep you loyal. And, if you start to stray and, you know, think for yourself, they kill you.\u2019\nPepper pressed her lips together. \u2018So what are you gonna do?\u2019\n\u2018I gotta get Banner outta there,\u2019 Tony said. \u2018Probably been a while since he\u2019s had human contact that didn\u2019t jump a foot in the air when he got startled. Loki\u2019s bound to show up again. And what\u2019s the bet they send old Cap after him? All I gotta do is wait.\u2019\n\u2018You don\u2019t think he can take him?\u2019 Pepper asked.\n\u2018The man\u2019s just woken up from a 68-year nap, and I\u2019m not dead sure \u201cpeak human condition\u201d measures up to...well, that.\u2019 He gestured to Thor\u2019s profile where the Asgardian\u2019s feats of strength were on full display.\nPepper nodded in acquiescence. \u2018I\u2019ll fly to DC tonight.\u2019\n\u2018Tomorrow!\u2019 Tony insisted.\n\u2018You have homework,\u2019 Pepper told him. \u2018You have a lot of homework.\u2019\n\u2018Well, what if I...didn\u2019t?\u2019 Tony turned to her.\nPepper looked back at him. \u2018If you didn\u2019t?\u2019\n\u2018Yeah.\u2019\n\u2018You mean if you finished it?\u2019\nTony nodded.\n\u2018Well, um...then...\u2019 She leaned up and whispered in Tony\u2019s ear.\nTony\u2019s jaw dropped. When she pulled back, he nodded. \u2018Square deal. Fly safe.\u2019\nPepper smiled and kissed him.\n***\nPepper looked at her phone as it went off. Heading to Germany. Love you. Tony. She smiled and tucked her phone as she and the employees coming with her. Her own PA, Karen, handed her a folder and Pepper flicked through it, checking over what needed to be done again.\nThere was another reason Tony doubted Steve Rogers could take on Loki.\nS.H.I.E.L.D. had offered him no counselling, no integration programs, and had made no effort whatsoever to acclimatise him to the 21st century. They regarded the man as a weapon and nothing more. It made Pepper pity him, to be honest. The last thing he knew, it was the middle of the 40s, and suddenly he\u2019s in the very different 21st century with no friends, no real allies, and S.H.I.E.L.D. were the ones to scoop him up. The man was just going to be thrown out with no preparation.\nOh, well, if he was everything they said he was he\u2019d get himself out of that one. Pepper just hoped Tony could extract Dr. Banner.\nS.H.I.E.L.D.\u2019s interest in the physicist was what got Tony\u2019s attention. Tony had watched numerous pieces of footage of both Bruce Banner and the Hulk. He was convinced that the Hulk was not the mindless beast that he was presumed to be. And Dr. Banner certainly needed help. The man had been on his own since the Hulk had been born, and that wasn\u2019t good for any human.\nPepper boarded her plane.\n***\nGermanySteve was eager to get back into the fold.\nSteve was a hero, and this was what he did. S.H.I.E.L.D. had dropped him off and given him some kind of earpiece which allowed him communication with them. Natasha had said \u201cit\u2019s like a radio, but it fits in your ear\u201d. He was quite happy to leave all the technology issues to S.H.I.E.L.D. \u2013 like he used to with Howard.\nWho, it turned out, was one of the founders of S.H.I.E.L.D., along with Peggy.\nWhen he arrived on the street, he was met with the sight of a large group of people being forced to kneel before the guy Director Fury had called Loki. One man, however, was refusing to kneel. As he quickly approached, Steve heard the conversation that was going on between the bad guy and the civilian.\n\u2018Not to men like you,\u2019 the civilian said. He was an older man. Steve wasn\u2019t sure if he was foolish or brave. It didn\u2019t matter anyway.\n\u2018There are no men like me,\u2019 Loki said.\n\u2018There are always men like you.\u2019\nLoki smiled and lifted his sceptre. \u2018Look to your elder, people.\u2019 He pointed it at him. \u2018Let him be an example.\u2019\nSteve jumped in front of him as Loki shot something from his sceptre. He used the old shield, which S.H.I.E.L.D. had gotten back for him, to deflect the blast. The man stumbled back behind him. When Steve lowered the shield, he saw that Loki had stumbled as the blast had been reflected right back at him. Steve stood up straight.\n\u2018You know,\u2019 Steve stepped down the steps and approached Loki, who was now glaring up at him, \u2018the last time I was in Germany, and saw a man standing above everybody else, we ended up disagreeing.\u2019\n\u2018The soldier!\u2019 Loki stood and chuckled. \u2018A man out of time.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m not the one who\u2019s outta time.\u2019 Steve heard the helicopter behind him.\nNatasha\u2019s voice came over the PA. \u2018Loki, drop the weapon and stand down!\u2019\nLoki fired at them. The chopper dodged. Steve threw his shield. It bounced off of Loki\u2019s helmet. The crowd of people bolted. Steve caught his shield and landed a punch in Loki\u2019s face. Generally when he did that, his opponent went flying \u2013 the only exception being the Red Skull. Loki, though, didn\u2019t even stagger back a step. He swung his sceptre down at Steve. Steve blocked with his shield, but Loki spun the other end of his staff and knocked the shield aside.\nSteve was jabbed in the gut.\nHe was then thrown back, but Steve quickly recovered himself. This guy wasn\u2019t like the Red Skull. He was far more powerful. But Steve was still confident that he could beat him. Steve was a hero. He took down tyrants and bullies. Steve tossed his shield at Loki again. This time, however, Loki deflected it. Steve went to hand-to-hand combat. He held his own for a few seconds before he was knocked across the pavement again.\nAs he tried to push himself up, he felt the sharp end of the staff press against the back of his head. \u2018Kneel!\u2019 Loki hissed.\nSteve knocked it aside. He jumped up and rounded a kick at Loki. Loki quickly recovered though. Loki caught him by the neck and threw him. Steve hit the ground again. Then something bizarre happened. A melody-less, tuneless kind of music with the vocalist shouting rather than singing came through his earpiece.\n\nWhat is that?\n\nA man\u2019s voice \u2013 unfamiliar to Steve \u2013 came through. \u2018Sorry to interrupt, Agent Romanoff,\u2019 he didn\u2019t sound sorry, \u2018but my old grandpa was born in this city. Afraid I don\u2019t like some guy tearing it up.\u2019\nIn the next instant, something shot out of the sky. It seemed to be a red and gold suit of armour. The person inside \u2013 because Steve had seen pictures of the thing, and it was quite different in real life \u2013 lifted a hand. Loki was hit by a beam of light of some kind. He was thrown back into a set of stairs.\nIron Man landed on the ground in a half-crouch, leaving cracks in the pavement. He straightened up and extended both arms. One had the palm open and a light glowed from within \u2013 probably another blast like the previous one. The other was a down-facing fist. A gun of some kind extended out from the top of the wrist. More small guns came out of the shoulders. All aimed for Loki.\nThis was Howard\u2019s son.\nNobody had been able to explain why Howard\u2019s son \u2013 who was just an engineer and a businessman like his father \u2013 had decided to put on a suit of armour and play hero. All they told him was that the kid had been raised to always be the centre of attention. So Steve figured it was an ego thing. Steve had questioned why Howard had let his child grow up like that.\n\u2018Howard didn\u2019t really have a choice,\u2019 Fury told him. \u2018The Press just loved following the kid around everywhere he went. Anytime he did anything, it was front-page news. It\u2019s the reason why he never joined S.H.I.E.L.D., really. He just draws in too much attention.\u2019\nAnd, yeah, Howard couldn\u2019t be blamed for that.\n\u2018Make your move, Reindeer Games,\u2019 Tony Stark said.\nSteve retrieved his shield and stepped up next to him. Part of him was annoyed. He had the situation under control. He would have found a weakness eventually. Loki would have worn out before he did. Still, Howard\u2019s son had helped him and he had been raised correctly.\nLoki\u2019s body glowed gold and all the unnecessary gold faded off of him. He raised his hands in surrender. It could have been Steve\u2019s imagination, but that seemed almost too easy. Howard\u2019s son tucked the weapons away and lowered his arms as the plane flew down again. Tony Stark seemed oblivious. \u2018Good move.\u2019\nSteve addressed the billionaire. \u2018Mr. Stark.\u2019\nThe helmet turned slightly. \u2018Captain.\u2019\nBut Steve wasn\u2019t happy at being upstaged.\nTriskelion, New York\nThor hadn\u2019t been expecting S.H.I.E.L.D. to have already apprehended Loki, but that was how he met the Captain and Son of Stark.\nIt was only when they returned to the base that Thor, having observed Stark make several of their phone calls and appear to be delegating and organising, that he was able to ask and discovered that Son of Stark was, in fact, a Noble. He owned several estates all over Midgard, ran what was essentially a small empire, and was responsible for the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people. In this century, that translated to the men and women under his care would work for him. In return, he would give them the money they needed to survive: to live in their homes, to acquire food and garments, and to pay for whatever else they needed.\nThus, Son of Stark was a Noble \u2013 or a jarl as they were called in Asgard.\nThat was why Thor didn\u2019t protest again when Son of Stark strode by him and tapped his arm with the remark. \u2018No hard feelings, Point Break. You got a mean swing.\u2019\nHowever, as Son of Stark walked around the command room, Thor noticed his spine was stiff. This was generally the mark of a man surrounded by enemies. Why should he feel such a thing in this place? Thor made a note to go to Heimdall after this battle was won and ask. It did seem such a curious thing to be wary here.\n\u2018Also,\u2019 Son of Stark said, continuing what he\u2019d been speaking of, \u2018means the portal can open as wide and stay open as long as Loki wants.\u2019 He looked around, and then pointed. \u2018That man is playing Galaga! Thought we wouldn\u2019t notice, but we did.\u2019 He then looked at the screens. He then covered an eye looked at the screens in front of him and then turned around, lowering his hand. \u2018How does Fury even see these?\u2019\n\u2018He turns,\u2019 one of the women stated.\n\u2018Sounds exhausting.\u2019 He started manipulating one of the screens. \u2018The rest of the raw materials Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily. Only major component he still needs is a power source, of high energy density.\u2019 He turned back around. \u2018Something to...\u2019 He made a motion with his hands. \u2018...kick-start the cube.\u2019\nThe woman spoke to him again. \u2018When did you become an expert in thermo-nuclear astro-physics?\u2019\n\u2018Last night,\u2019 he said without missing a beat. \nThe woman turned her head, as if impressed...or curious.\nHe then went on with his explanation. \u2018Unless Selvig has figured out how to stabilise the quantum tunnelling effect.\u2019\nDr. Banner spoke up. \u2018Well, if he could do that, he could achieve heavy ion fusion at any reactor on the planet.\u2019\nSon of Stark grinned and walked over to him. \u2018Finally! Someone who speaks English!\u2019\n\u2018Oh, is that what happened?\u2019 the Captain asked, evidentially as lost as Thor himself was.\nThor did watch in amusement though as Son of Stark greeting Dr. Banner by acknowledging both his work, and some kind of \u201cgreen rage monster\u201d. It was most curious how many in the room froze up at such a statement. Son of Stark ignored them though.\nThen the conversation turned to Loki.\nDr. Banner chuckled. \u2018He really grows on you, doesn\u2019t he?\u2019\n\u2018Loki\u2019s going to drag this out,\u2019 the Captain said. \u2018So...Thor, what\u2019s his play?\u2019\n\u2018He has an army called the Chitauri,\u2019 Thor said. \u2018They\u2019re not of Asgard, nor any world known.\u2019 He turned to face the Captain. \u2018He\u2019s to lead them against your people. They will win him the Earth, in return, I suspect, for the Tesseract.\u2019\n\u2018An army?\u2019 the Captain asked. He looked at Agent Romanoff. \u2018From outer space?\u2019\nDr. Banner pulled the spectacles off of his face. \u2018So he\u2019s building another portal? That\u2019s what he needs Eric Selvig for.\u2019\n\u2018Selvig?\u2019 Thor asked.\n\u2018He was an astrophysicist,\u2019 Dr. Banner supplied.\n\u2018Is he your friend?\u2019\nAgent Romanoff answered that one. \u2018Loki has him under some kind of spell, along with one of ours.\u2019\n\u2018I want to know why Loki let us take him,\u2019 the Captain stated. \u2018He\u2019s not leading an army from here.\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t think we should be focusing on Loki,\u2019 Dr. Banner said. \u2018That guy\u2019s brain is a bag full of cats. You can smell crazy on him.\u2019\nThor stepped forward. \u2018Have care how you speak. Loki is beyond reason, but he is an Asgard. And he is my brother.\u2019\n\u2018He killed 80 people in 2 days,\u2019 Agent Romanoff stated with a flat voice.\nThat few? \u2018He\u2019s adopted.\u2019\n***\nBruce was relieved when he and Tony \u2013 he\u2019d said to call him Tony \u2013 could move to the lab.\n\u2018You know, you should come to the lab in my Tower,\u2019 Tony told him. \u2018It\u2019s Candy-land.\u2019\n\u2018Thanks, but,\u2019 Bruce chuckled. \u2018The last time I was in New York, I kind of...broke Harlem.\u2019\nTony gave a tight smile and walked to the other side of the screen Bruce was using. He knocked the data aside. \u2018I read all about your accident,\u2019 he said. \u2018That much gamma radiation should have killed you.\u2019\n\u2018So you\u2019re saying that the Hulk...the Other Guy saved my life? That\u2019s nice.\u2019 Actually, now that he mentioned it...he was right. If the Hulk hadn\u2019t come into existence in that moment, Bruce would currently be worm food. \u2018It\u2019s a nice sentiment. Saved it for...what?\u2019\n\u2018Guess we\u2019ll find out.\u2019\n\u2018You may not enjoy that,\u2019 Bruce remarked.\n\u2018And you just might.\u2019\nThe two of them continued work. Bruce had to say, he enjoyed working with someone who didn\u2019t think he was liable to hulk-out and attack at any given moment. Even that brief interruption by Steve, who seemed determined Tony was an immature kid playing around was of little concern. Steve had only been back a month so he possibly didn\u2019t know about the events of 2005.\nMade Bruce wonder why Tony chose to come here.\nWhen Fury came in, Tony deflected his attention from Bruce by asking, \u2018So why wasn\u2019t Marvel brought in?\u2019\nFury looked like he\u2019d smelt something nasty. \u2018Captain Danvers is not qualified for the Avengers Initiative.\u2019\nTony cocked an eyebrow. \u2018So, the one person on Earth with actual experience with alien invasions is not qualified to deal with an alien invasion?\u2019\nBruce frowned. He\u2019d never heard of this person, but it was clear Fury had. Tony was right. If there was someone with experience in alien invasions, then that was the first person you should call for an alien invasion. A group of super-powered people was one thing, but they had no experience in these things.\n\u2018Mind your business, Stark!\u2019 Fury snapped.\n\u2018Sure.\u2019 Tony turned and flicked something on the computer. \u2018So what is Phase 2?\u2019\nFury looked like a vein in his forehead was about to burst when Steve walked in a slammed a gun of some sort on the table. \u2018Phase 2 is S.H.I.E.L.D. using the cube to make weapons. I\u2019m sorry; the computer was moving a little slow for me.\u2019\nFury walked over to him. \u2018Rogers, we gathered everything related to the Tesseract. This gun does not mean that we\u2019re\u2014\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m sorry, Nick!\u2019 Tony interrupted him and turned his computer screen around, showing the blueprints for the very weapon Steve had laid down. \u2018What were you lying?\u2019\n\u2018I was wrong, Director,\u2019 Steve said as Thor and Romanoff walked in. \u2018The world hasn\u2019t changed a bit.\u2019\n\u2018Did you know about this?\u2019 Bruce asked Romanoff.\n\u2018Don\u2019t you want to think about removing yourself from this environment, doctor?\u2019 Romanoff asked.\nBruce scoffed. \u2018When I was in Calcutta, I was pretty well removed.\u2019\n\u2018He\u2019s manipulating you,\u2019 Romanoff stated.\n\u2018And you\u2019ve been doing what exactly?\u2019\n\u2018You didn\u2019t come here because I batted my eyelashes at you.\u2019\nNo. He came here because he wasn\u2019t give a choice. \u2018Yes, and I\u2019m not leaving because suddenly you get a little twitchy.\u2019 He walked over to the screen and turned it towards himself. \u2018I\u2019d like to know why S.H.I.E.L.D. is using the Tesseract to build weapons of mass destruction.\u2019\n\u2018Because of him,\u2019 Fury pointed to Thor.\nThor looked confused. \u2018Me?\u2019\n\u2018Last year Earth had a visitor from another planet who had a grunge match that levelled a small town,\u2019 Fury said. \u2018We learned that not only are we not alone, but we are hopelessly, hilariously outgunned.\u2019\n\u2018My people want nothing but peace with your planet,\u2019 Thor stated.\nFury turned on him. \u2018But you\u2019re not the only people out there, are you? And you\u2019re not the only threat. The world\u2019s filling up with people who can\u2019t be matched. They can\u2019t be controlled.\u2019\nA tick took up residence in Tony\u2019s jaw.\n\u2018Like you controlled the cube?\u2019 Steve asked.\nThor stepped forward. \u2018Your work with the Tesseract is what drew Loki to it, and his allies. It is a signal to all the realms that the Earth is ready for a higher form of war.\u2019\n\u2018Higher form?\u2019 Steve asked.\n\u2018You\u2019ve forced our hand,\u2019 Fury stated.\n\u2018No, they didn\u2019t,\u2019 Tony said.\nTony had all the attention in the room. \u2018You saw guys with bigger guns than you, and you got scared. It\u2019s a nuclear deterrent, cause that always calms everything right down.\u2019\nFury glared at him. \u2018Remind me how you made your fortune, Stark.\u2019\nTony smirked. \u2018During World War 2, if you\u2019d care to remember.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m sure if he\u2019d have thought of it first, Stark would be neck-deep\u2014\u2019\n\u2018Wait, wait, hold on.\u2019 Tony interrupted him. \u2018How is this now about me?\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 Steve\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u2018Isn\u2019t everything. They told me about how you abandoned Peggy to throw a temper tantrum.\u2019\nBruce wouldn\u2019t call it a temper tantrum. Tony\u2019s eyes narrowed and his expression went cold. He looked every bit the dangerous businessman he was purported to be. \u2018Abandoned? Peggy Carter abandoned me long before I had enough of her.\u2019\nSteve got in his face. \u2018You take that back.\u2019\nTony didn\u2019t back down, though. \u2018She covered up my parents\u2019 murder and then left me alone to deal with it. And that\u2019s not even mentioning what she did when they were alive.\u2019\nBruce noticed the look on Thor\u2019s face become outraged.\n\u2018You parents died in a car accident,\u2019 Rogers snapped.\n\u2018No.\u2019 Bruce felt the need to intervene. \u2018No, Rogers. There\u2019s video evidence.\u2019 Bruce remembered when he\u2019d seen that on TV. He and everyone else in that small diner had frozen up in shock as they watched Howard and Maria Stark get murdered on a back road in the night. The video had been followed by a public call for any information regarding their killer.\nRogers glanced back in annoyance.\n\u2018Look at this.\u2019 Thor shook his head in disgust. \u2018I thought you were more evolved than this. You have performed one of the worst transgressions upon any living beings. You seek control, and yet your cause chaos.\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s his M-O, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 Bruce remarked.\nFury looked over, annoyed.\n\u2018I mean, what are we, a team?\u2019 Bruce shook his head. \u2018No, no, no. We\u2019re a chemical mixture that makes chaos. We\u2019re...\u2019 He shrugged. \u2018We\u2019re a time bomb.\u2019\n\u2018You need to step away,\u2019 Fury stated.\n\u2018Why shouldn\u2019t the guy let off some steam?\u2019 Tony asked.\n\u2018You know damn well why!\u2019 Steve snapped. \u2018Back off!\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m starting to want you to make me.\u2019\n\u2018Yeah.\u2019 Steve sneered and began circling him. Bruce didn\u2019t like the look of it. It looked like the guy\u2019s legend was just that: a legend. \u2018Big man in a suit of armour. Take that off and what are you?\u2019\n\u2018Genius, playboy, billionaire, philanthropist.\u2019\n\u2018I know guys with none of that worth ten of you,\u2019 Steve said. \u2018And I\u2019ve seen the footage. The only\u2014\u2019\n\u2018What footage?\u2019 Tony interrupted him.\nSteve sneered but didn\u2019t answer. \u2018The only thing you really fight for is yourself. You\u2019re not the guy to make the sacrifice play, to lay on the wire and let the other guy crawl over you.\u2019\n\u2018I think I would just cut the wire.\u2019\nSteve sneered and looked around. There was enough condescension in his expression to drip. \u2018Always a way out. You know, you may not be a threat but you better stop pretending to be a hero.\u2019\n\u2018A hero?\u2019 Tony scoffed. \u2018Like you? You\u2019re a laboratory experiment, Rogers. Everything special about you came out of a bottle.\u2019\nRogers, then, attempted to pick a fight. \u2018Put on the suit. Let\u2019s go a few rounds.\u2019\nTony smirked and walked away. He grabbed his jacket. \u2018You know, actually, I\u2019m gonna do what mom always told me to do when some jackass is trying to pick a fight: I\u2019m gonna walk away.\u2019 He looked over. \u2018You coming, Bruce? Captain Marvel ought to know what to do about this staff. She got her powers from exposure to Kree tech.\u2019\n\u2018I think I will.\u2019 Bruce grabbed his own jacket.\nTony grabbed the staff and twirled it.\nEveryone but Thor flinched back. Instead, he stepped forward. \u2018Would you mind if I were to accompany you?\u2019\n\u2018Not at all,\u2019 Tony said, leading both Bruce and Thor to the door. \u2018Have you ridden in a car before, Point Break?\u2019\n\u2018I have.\u2019\n\u2018Stark!\u2019 Fury barked.\n\u2018You want me, you know my number. Oh, JARVIS,\u2019 Tony sing-songed the last bit as he passed the sceptre to Thor.\n\u2018Of course, sir.\u2019 A British-accented voice came from above. The door closed behind them and sealed the others inside with a reinforced door that was apparently there.\n\u2018A servant?\u2019 Thor asked.\n\u2018Something like that,\u2019 Tony agreed.\nIt must\u2019ve been the AI Tony was famous for building and owning. JARVIS spoke up again. \u2018Sir, I have already informed Captain Danvers and Lt. Col. Rhodes of the situation. They are currently heading for the Tower. Shall I also inform the federal authorities?\u2019\nTony nodded. \u2018Good idea. Tell them to clear any area of civilians where there\u2019s a reactor.\u2019\n***\nThor followed Son of Stark and Dr. Banner out of the elevator and into a large set of rooms in the Tower. Thor sat down on the couch. Son of Stark walked over to an area where there was food as several transparent screens appeared and Dr. Banner returned to work. Son of Stark brought over some soda for them to drink whilst they waited on his friends to arrive. It was despicable to think that S.H.I.E.L.D., who had seemed concerned with the safety of their world, had covered up murder, and denied the victims justice.\n\u2018Are you sure Loki will be all right in there?\u2019 Thor asked.\n\u2018I wouldn\u2019t worry,\u2019 Son of Stark said. \u2018He clearly intended to get captured so it ought to be part of his plan.\u2019\nBruce gave a light nod.\n\u2018So then why did the Captain keep pressing the issue?\u2019 Thor asked.\nSon of Stark gave a light smile. \u2018I\u2019ll be honest. Not a lot of people know much about him. He\u2019s more of a living legend over anything else.\u2019\n\u2018And,\u2019 JARVIS added in, \u2018I have just found records that indicate he scarcely completed a week of boot camp.\u2019\nDr. Banner bit back a chuckle. Son of Stark let out a low whistle.\n\u2018Boot camp?\u2019 Thor asked.\n\u2018It\u2019s what we call basic training,\u2019 Son of Stark said.\nOh, that was very bad indeed.\nSuddenly Dr. Banner turned from the screen he was at. \u2018Tony, should this be happening?\u2019\nSon of Stark walked over and took a look. \u2018No.\u2019 He looked up.\n\u2018What is it?\u2019 Thor asked.\n\u2018There\u2019s something going on up on the roof,\u2019 Tony said. \u2018JARVIS?\u2019\n\u2018Col. Rhodes and Cap. Danvers are only a moment away, sir,\u2019 JARVIS said. \u2018The figure on the roof is alone and identifies as Agent Selvig.\u2019\n\u2018Son of a bitch,\u2019 Son of Stark said.\nA moment later, as promised, two people landed. One of them wore a suit much like the one Son of Stark used. As he walked along the platform, a series of machines removed the suit from him, revealing a man who was clearly a soldier. The second person was a blonde woman who landed on the balcony and seemed capable of self-sustained flight.\n\u2018Tones,\u2019 the man said. \u2018Do you know you have somebody on your roof?\u2019\n\u2018Yeah,\u2019 Son of Stark said. \u2018What say we see what they want?\u2019\nTo be greatly honest, Bruce wasn\u2019t surprised.\nWithout Selvig building the device on top of the Tower, the invasion never happened. Instead, Captain Carol Danvers, otherwise known as Captain Marvel, had, with her experience in alien invasions, worked out how to reverse the effects of the sceptre \u2013 a second tap to the chest just reversed the effects. The poor man was currently down in the lounge, having a stiff drink.\nWhen Loki, having broken out of S.H.I.E.L.D.\u2019s HQ, arrived he found himself having to deal with his brother, Iron Man, Iron Patriot, and Captain Marvel. The Hulk hadn\u2019t been needed. The invasion had been thwarted and that was that. Tony had then given Thor back the Tesseract and the sceptre and they left, with Loki in shackles. Thor had promised to see if he could find the identity of the Starks\u2019 killer in Asgard.\nApparently, there was a seer up there who \u201csaw all\u201d.\nTony extended an invitation to Bruce to live in the Tower. Over the next few weeks, he even built a Smash Room for the Hulk. They\u2019d also gotten quite a few annoyed phone calls from Steve Rogers. There was no apology for his harsh statements towards Tony \u2013 statements that held absolutely no grounding in truth \u2013 but most of it seemed to be reprimand for \u201cnot working with the team\u201d and \u201cnot telling me what you were doing\u201d.\nTony, quite amusingly, had actually called some guys in the FBI and asked them to do a profile on Rogers. Bruce also saw the profiles on the various S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents that Tony already had. He wasn\u2019t overly surprised to see words like \u201csociopathic\u201d and \u201csuspected (insert word here) personality disorder\u201d. The one on Steve that came back a few months later was even more amusing.\n\u201cDisplays signs of the Dunning-Kruger Effect\u201d.\n\u201cApparent need to be praised constantly\u201d.\n\u201cLacks empathy\u201d.\n\u201cCapable of critical thinking skills, but is seemingly reluctant to put effort into using these aforementioned skills\u201d.\nThor returned to share some bad news with Tony. \u2018Heimdall did look for the assassin,\u2019 he told Tony. \u2018However, there have been a few obstacles.\u2019\n\u2018Such as?\u2019 Tony asked.\n\u2018The first is the time which has passed since the deed was done,\u2019 Thor explained. \u2018If we were closer to the event, he would be able to see much clearer. The second problem is in that the man he sees is a different man to the one who actually committed the crime.\u2019\n\u2018Hm.\u2019 Tony frowned. \u2018Could be the guy who hired him to do it.\u2019\n\u2018Aye, that was Heimdall\u2019s conclusion.\u2019\nThe Avengers were otherwise formed, but without Bruce, Tony, or Thor. Bruce knew that Fury only wanted him so he could control the Hulk. He only wanted Tony so he had access to his genius, his resources, and his vast fortune. (Everyone had heard about that.) And apparently, though not surprisingly, the people of Asgard considered what S.H.I.E.L.D. had done to the Starks to be the height of dishonour.\nSo Thor wanted nothing to do with them.\nThe Avengers consisted of Rogers as the leader, along with Romanoff, Barton, and a few others. They were known to disappear to other countries. They\u2019d smash everything up and then just saunter back to the Triskelion. Then they couldn\u2019t understand why people were yelling at them and suing them for damages.\nYet another reason S.H.I.E.L.D. would have wanted Tony.\nBruce himself actually enjoyed being in an environment like this. He was back in a lab, with a room made especially for the Hulk, and working with people who weren\u2019t afraid he was going to kill them: Tony, Pepper, Rhodey, and Carol. It turned out the Hulk liked them too. On the few occasions he did end up Hulking out, not a single one of them had been hurt.\n\u2018He just goes straight to the Smash Room, usually,\u2019 Tony said when he asked one day. \u2018Every so often, though, he helps me work out just how strong he is.\u2019\n\u2018He\u2019s fine with that?\u2019 That had surprised Bruce.\n\u2018Apparently.\u2019 Tony had chuckled. \u2018Anyway, it seems like his strength is directly related to his anger. The angrier he gets, the stronger he gets. Which means, as long as he\u2019s conscious, there is literally no limit to just how powerful the Hulk could become. That cell they had prepped for him\u2014\u2019 They both knew it was there. \u2018\u2014would have done nothing to contain him.\u2019\nThat was simultaneously amusing and terrifying.\nThen, one day, Carol walked in with a thick document. \u2018Have you seen these?\u2019\nTony looked up from his computer screen and walked over. \u2018Are these those super-human regulations I\u2019ve heard about?\u2019\nApparently, with the Avengers blundering about the place, the world had become nervous. They went where they wanted, answerable only to S.H.I.E.L.D., whom didn\u2019t have the best reputation. The United Nations had begun drafting up a set of checks and balances for every enhanced individual across the planet.\n\u2018This is gonna take a while to get through,\u2019 Tony remarked. \u2018It\u2019s still heavily underdeveloped, but I think I can see what they\u2019re doing.\u2019\n\u2018What\u2019s that?\u2019 Bruce asked.\n\u2018They\u2019re trying to get every other enhanced to fall under this,\u2019 Tony said. \u2018That way they can put pressure on Fury to put the Avengers under it too. This is the whole world \u2013 or close to it \u2013 saying that they\u2019re scared of the Avengers.\u2019 He looked at Carol. \u2018How\u2019d you get your hands on it so soon?\u2019\n\u2018My CO wanted me to have my two cents,\u2019 Carol said. \u2018Seeing as I work under a chain of command already, I\u2019ve become the poster child for the fact that super-humans can be reasonable and law-abiding citizens. They want as many as they can squeeze in.\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s a UN document?\u2019 Bruce asked.\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 Carol said. \u2018They want us to look over it and make as many amendments as we can. If the enhanced community is going to agree to these, we need to make them amendable to the minds of any super-human.\u2019\n\u2018With just us?\u2019 Tony asked. \u2018I\u2019ve got a better idea.\u2019\nOver the next few weeks, Tony took several copies of the draft out and got them back, all marked with amendments and questions. They were then negotiated on in the UN with Tony, Carol, and Rhodey speaking on behalf of the enhanced community. It turned out that Tony had worked out who most of the superheroes running around the city were \u2013 and if he hadn\u2019t, he went to them while they were out and about and explained the situation.\nWhen Bruce had to give his cousin, Jennifer, blood and she became She-Hulk, she got in on it too. He really should\u2019ve seen that coming. (Hell, he shouldn\u2019t have been able to give her blood because his contained damn gamma radiation!) Thankfully, though, her transformation was far more controlled and less destructive.\nAs a lawyer herself, Jennifer joined the other three was able to give more amendments and more compelling arguments to the UN panel for the amendments they wanted.\nWhen Bruce had been in the Tower a few months (word had certainly got around), he was surprised that he received a visit from Betty Ross. Her father was being unusually quiet. She was suspicious and so was Bruce, and so was Tony. A quick look by JARVIS and they found out that he was trying to weasel his way into the negotiations by becoming Secretary of State, which meant kissing the President\u2019s ass and framing a few people for certain crimes to get them out of his way.\nSo, in concern for the President\u2019s safety, the FBI (who Tony had contacted to call in a favour) had found and released Ross\u2019s illegal operations to the public.\nBruce nearly laughed at the look on his face when Thaddeus Ross was carted off.\nNew York \u2013 2014 \u2013 2 Years LaterIt started with a phone call from Maria Hill of S.H.I.E.L.D., who actually had something important to say.\nTony\u2019s response? \u2018Oh, that dumbass!\u2019 Maria said something else, and Tony amended. \u2018Dumbasses, then.\u2019\nAll over the world, S.H.I.E.L.D. buildings exploded as a result of Steve Rogers\u2019 \u201cbrilliant\u201d plan, taking out everything within the immediate vicinity. Debris rained on unsuspecting civilians and countless people died. Every single person on the S.H.I.E.L.D. database was suddenly exposed online and endangered.\nTony called the CIA and FBI first and then he focused on the people that could still be saved. JARIVS contacted every civilian in danger and had them evacuate to the nearest SI, FBI, or CIA building for protection. Rhodey, Carol, and several other military leaders began negotiations to extract those agents who were in enemy territory when the information was dropped. Pepper worked on damage control. As a physicist, Bruce couldn\u2019t do much but he helped Tony where he could.\n\u2018So how are we looking?\u2019 Bruce asked, coming down into the workshop, where Tony and Hill were working through all the data they possibly could.\n\u2018Pretty good, actually,\u2019 Agent Hill said. \u2018We\u2019ve saved over 60% of agents and civilians. And Romanoff was just arrested.\u2019\n\u2018What about Rogers?\u2019 Bruce asked.\n\u2018Disappeared to parts unknown since his old BFF showed up,\u2019 Tony said.\n\u2018BFF?\u2019 Bruce asked.\n\u2018James Buchannan Barnes, better known as Bucky,\u2019 Agent Hill reported, seemingly habitually. \u2018He was a Sergeant in the 107th during World War 2. He and Rogers grew up together and he was listed as the only friend Rogers had back then. While Rogers was officially the leader of the Howling Commandos, in reality Barnes was. While he wasn\u2019t the ranking officer, he was the only one Rogers would listen to.\u2019 She screwed up her face. \u2018I observed the same problem on the Avengers Initiative. Rogers didn\u2019t listen to any opinions that differed from his own and he had no patience for waiting on reconnaissance.\u2019\n\u2018Turns out this guy was the only one who could give him a dissenting opinion he would listen to,\u2019 Tony said, \u2018and it didn\u2019t always work.\u2019 He was still scanning through the files.\n\u2018Less than a day before Rogers crashed into the Arctic, Barnes fell from a train travelling across a cliff top in Austria,\u2019 Hill explained. \u2018He was presumed dead. He just showed up as the Winter Soldier, an assassin cited as the most deadly in the world.\u2019\nTony glared at his computer screen as if it personally offended him. \u2018And he was brainwashed. Wouldn\u2019t you know it?\u2019\n\u2018Brainwashed?\u2019 Bruce walked over and looked at the screen. \u2018Oh...\u2019 The information on the screen was exactly what Tony had been looking for since 2005. \u2018Where\u2019d you find this?\u2019\n\u2018S.H.I.E.L.D. data-dump,\u2019 Tony said. \u2018The actual HYDRA bits.\u2019\n\u2018So what are you gonna do?\u2019 Agent Hill asked.\nTony looked over. \u2018Rhodey and Carol are already on their way in, with the feds.\u2019\n***\nBucharest, RomaniaBucky had only been slipping around the city a week, slowly getting his bearings back \u2013 but he could still hardly remember his own name \u2013 when he heard his name called.\n\u2018Sergeant Barnes?\u2019\nBucky\u2019s heart rate skyrocketed. He spun around, reaching for the gun that he knew wasn\u2019t there. He was faced with two people, both in military uniform. The African-American man, if his foggy memory served him, was a Lieutenant Colonel. The blonde woman wore Captain\u2019s bars on her shoulders. They were American. American...\n\u2018My name is Lt. Col. James Rhodes,\u2019 the man said. \u2018I am joined by Captain Carol Danvers. We\u2019ve been sent to apprehend you by Tony Stark.\u2019\nAt the word \u201capprehend\u201d, Bucky took a step back. Then he heard \u201cTony Stark\u201d. It took a moment for the name to click \u2013 and the reason for him to want Bucky apprehended. \u2018...Howard\u2019s kid?\u2019\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 Col. Rhodes said.\nHoward\u2019s kid...Bucky saw that night all over again. The car crashing...Howard falling out, dragging himself across the dirt, begging for whoever was there to help his wife. The look on his face when he realised that no, this was an attack that was only half-done; when he recognised him. The sound of Howard\u2019s wife screaming her husband\u2019s name, the feel of her throat closing under his hand. The woman had been so terrified or horrified that she couldn\u2019t even move to try and push his hand away.\nHe\u2019d liked Howard; had looked up to him. None of that had mattered in the end. He\u2019d still killed him. He couldn\u2019t break the conditioning, even after Howard called him by name \u2013 the first one to do so in over 50 years. And he\u2019d left Howard\u2019s kid an orphan. Now, Tony Stark had come to collect the justice his parents had been for so long denied.\nBucky raised his hands in surrender.\nCol. Rhodes nodded. A man in uniform came over and put him in cuffs.\n***\nBucharest Police StationRhodey looked through the viewing glass. Barnes was sitting there, offering no resistance. He would soon be extradited back to America, where he would be psychologically evaluated and tried for his crimes as the Winter Soldier. In all honesty, Rhodey expected him to be found \u201cnot guilty\u201d on the grounds of insanity or, at most, \u201cguilty of manslaughter on diminished capacity\u201d if they really wanted a guilty verdict.\nTony had initially suggested it, once he found the information. If Barnes wasn\u2019t as \u201ccured\u201d as Rogers had insisted to Hill he was (when she\u2019d been able to catch him), having Carol there would protect the baseline human agents that had originally come to apprehend him. Rhodey was there as back-up. But Barnes had come without a single word of complaint and without putting up anything of a fight. As they stood there, Jennifer Walters was in the room, talking to Barnes. She\u2019d agreed to take his case.\n\u2018I spoke to Agent Preston,\u2019 Carol said. Agent Preston was the CIA\u2019s field commander for this mission. \u2018The profilers doubt Rogers\u2019 story.\u2019\n\u2018Everyone does,\u2019 Rhodey said. \u2018Friendship is all very well and good, but I doubt it can break the effects of brainwashing.\u2019\nCarol nodded once. \u2018So do they. From what they got from Barnes himself, he was put on the machine fairly regularly.\u2019\n\u2018So there\u2019s a cycle.\u2019\n\u2018And they think Rogers got to him at the end of it, when the brainwashing was weakest.\u2019\n\u2018So less about the friendship; more about the timing.\u2019\n\u2018Exactly.\u2019 Carol looked at him. \u2018Why didn\u2019t they call Tony about Project Insight anyway? It was a tech problem and he\u2019s the tech guy.\u2019\n\u2018When Hill asked, she got a bunch of excuses,\u2019 Rhodey said. \u2018When Tony asked, both Rogers and Romanoff made cracks about his ego I\u2019d say it\u2019s about their own egos.\u2019\n\u2018They burned thousands of people over their egos?\u2019 Carol demanded.\n\u2018Yup.\u2019\nThey both looked in again as Jennifer stood up and walked out of the room. She walked over to them. \u2018Sgt. Barnes has given me the name of the man who sent him to kill the Starks.\u2019\nRhodey frowned grimly. This was what they\u2019d been searching for. This was the information Tony had sought for nine years. \u2018Who?\u2019\n\u2018Vasily Karpov.\u2019\n***\nCleveland, OhioThe front door, back door, and windows were kicked in.\nThe single resident leapt up and reached for his gun. He was quickly surrounded by several FBI agents and restrained though. The gun fell uselessly onto the ground. He growled and struggled. His hands were cuffed behind his back. It was only when a man came to stand in front of him that he looked up. He saw the man was wearing a suit.\n\u2018Vasily Karpov, you\u2019re under arrest.\u2019\n***\nStark Tower, New York City\u2018So, what about the Agents?\u2019 Pepper asked, bringing Tony has coffee.\n\u2018If they past all our psych tests, we\u2019re hiring them,\u2019 Tony said. He wrapped an arm around her as she sat down. \u2018Turns out they weren\u2019t made entirely of sociopaths. That was mostly just the guys in charge.\u2019\n\u2018Maria Hill?\u2019\n\u2018She was an exception, like dad.\u2019 Tony chuckled. \u2018While dad was funding them and giving them all their toys, Hill is scary-efficient. They didn\u2019t want to lose her. Fury bought her loyalty with high clearance levels. Turns out, she\u2019s neurotypical.\u2019\n\u2018Rogers?\u2019\n\u2018Well, he\u2019ll run out of S.H.I.E.L.D. funds soon. His new buddy, Wilson, got arrested for grand theft.\u2019\n\u2018The wings?\u2019\n\u2018The wings. Barnes will finally get the help he so desperately needs and then they\u2019ll try him.\u2019\n\u2018Sharon Carter?\u2019\n\u2018Absorbed into the CIA, where she can be watched far more easily. All the other Core Agents were also absorbed by either the CIA or the FBI.\u2019\n\u2018Barton?\u2019\nTony clicked his tongue. That had been a surprise. Clint Barton had a family \u2013 a wife and two kids. They\u2019d been endangered in the info-dump. JARVIS had contacted and moved them in the nick of time. When Barton, on a mission at the time, found out, he\u2019d suddenly had a complete change of heart in regards to Tony.\n\u2018Signed onto the FBI.\u2019 Tony sighed. \u2018He\u2019s a bit paranoid these days, and no one blames him.\u2019\n\u2018Karpov?\u2019\n\u2018He\u2019ll get the same kind of trial they wanted to put Stane through. CIA\u2019s already verified it. It\u2019ll be publically released tomorrow and the whole country will be baying for his blood. With their discovery in S.H.I.E.L.D., everyone\u2019s checking their own ranks for HYDRA, so they can\u2019t help him.\u2019\n\u2018So it\u2019s over?\u2019\nTony smiled.\n\n\u2018Jonathan Sandler. 1973. I buried him in a ditch 400 meters and 24\u00b0 south-east of where his car would\u2019ve been found.\u2019\n\n\n\u2018Allison Weston. 1959. She had evidence of HYDRA\u2019s existence, so I shot her and burned her Manhattan apartment building down. Made sure she was incinerated with the evidence.\u2019\n\n\n\u2018Cameron Trent. 1986. He was going to introduce a new bill that my handlers didn\u2019t like. So I broke his neck and made it look like he\u2019d fallen down the stairs and landed badly.\u2019\n\nAll over the country, the families of the Winter Soldier\u2019s victims finally had questions answered. They finally learned the truth. Missing bodies were recovered. Corpses were recovered. Bodies were exhumed and re-examined. Despite how difficult it was to do, it was the best thing that Bucky had done in over 70 years.\n***\n2016 \u2013 2 Years LaterSteve Rogers stared at the document in front of him. He then looked across the table. Tony Stark sat there with a four others. The only one at the table he recognised was Bruce Banner, who sat between Tony and a woman in a business suit. Two others in military uniform sat on Tony\u2019s other side. One of them was coloured, like Sam \u2013 No, the correct phrase now is African-American.\nSteve pushed the thick document in front of him away.\n\u2018Is that a no?\u2019 Tony asked. \u2018Because without signing this document you forfeit all legal rights to continue in the capacity of a super-hero.\u2019\nSteve levelled a disapproving look at him. \u2018The Avengers exist to protect the world\u2014\u2019\n\u2018Yeah, let\u2019s review, shall we?\u2019 Tony cut him off. \u2018Romanoff is currently sitting in prison for espionage and terrorism.\u2019\n\u2018She didn\u2019t do anything wrong!\u2019 Steve insisted. All of his attempts to discover where she was being held had failed, but he didn\u2019t doubt Tony knew.\nTony ignored him. \u2018Barton dropped into semi-retirement in 2014. The new guy you added, Sam Wilson. He\u2019s currently sitting in prison for grand theft!\u2019\n\u2018He was helping me!\u2019\n\u2018Those wings belong to the United States Air Force,\u2019 the blonde woman snapped. \u2018Just because he knew they existed, it did not give him rights to them, Mr. Rogers.\u2019\n\u2018Captain,\u2019 Steve sharply corrected.\nThe...African-American man looked at a file in front of him. \u2018No, Private at best. Seems you only completed a few days of boot camp, just shy of a week. You also never went to Command School.\u2019\n\u2018There was a war on! We didn\u2019t have time for red tape!\u2019\nBruce cracked a grin. \u2018You think just because there\u2019s a war on, they\u2019re gonna peel back the regulations?\u2019 He shook his head. \u2018If anything, they\u2019ll be enforced far more strictly. They want trained and competent people in charge in war zones. You were a publicity stunt, Rogers.\u2019\nSteve clenched his jaw. Suddenly a voice came from above, British-accented and sounded strangely like Howard\u2019s old butler. \u2018Sir, footage of a bombing has shown the Winter Soldier on the scene.\u2019\nSteve\u2019s gut dropped. Bucky! He had to get to him without Tony getting wise.\n\u2018Isn\u2019t he still in the hospital?\u2019 Tony asked, almost carelessly.\n\u2018I have just confirmed as much, sir, yes.\u2019\nSteve stood up and strode out. He never heard Tony say, \u2018JARVIS, tell the staff they may have a certain super-human blundering in before the day is out.\u2019\nSteve rushed out of the building and called Sharon. Within the hour, she met up with him. \u2018He\u2019s being held at the Manhattan Psychiatric Hospital.\u2019 The word \u201cpsychiatric\u201d sent Steve\u2019s blood cold and he rushed to get him out. Shock therapy and straightjackets...\nWhen he arrived at the hospital, there was a lack of people as he tore his way through, looking for Bucky. But they seemed to enter hallways behind him. He ended up grabbing an orderly and extracting the information. Then he ran into the back part of the hospital. He kicked down doors. At the last one, he was surprised to hear Bucky\u2019s voice, calm in a way it hadn\u2019t been since the 40s.\n\u2018I know for a fact that you can\u2019t afford to pay for that door, punk.\u2019\n\u2018Bucky!\u2019 Steve walked over to him. Bucky was just sitting on a chair at a desk. He was surprised to see there was no straightjacket. \u2018You remember me?\u2019\n\u2018Of course I do.\u2019\nSteve reached for his arm. \u2018We gotta go! Someone framed you for a bombing and they\u2019re coming to arrest you!\u2019 He was startled when Bucky knocked his arm away.\n\u2018There\u2019s a little thing called an alibi, Stevie,\u2019 he said. \u2018I\u2019ve been in here for two years. It is physically impossible for me to have gone and bombed any place.\u2019\n\u2018Two years?\u2019 Steve remembered what Tony had said and scowled. \u2018Tony put you in here.\u2019\n\u2018No, the state put me in here,\u2019 Bucky said. \u2018But Tony pays for it. Really, he shouldn\u2019t have to.\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019re fine with this?\u2019 Steve demanded. \u2018You\u2019re fine with Tony paying for electric shock!\u2019\nBucky looked at him funny. \u2018Steve, how long since you were thawed?\u2019\nSteve was thrown off by the random question. \u2018Uh...4 years.\u2019\n\u2018And you still don\u2019t know that electro-shock therapy is outlawed?\u2019 Bucky asked. \u2018They don\u2019t do it.\u2019\n\u2018What?\u2019 Steve quickly recovered himself. \u2018But he still has you in a loony bin! It\u2019s internment, Bucky!\u2019\n\u2018Psychiatric hospital, punk.\u2019 Bucky frowned at him. \u2018I spent over half a century being consistently brainwashed. Mental health has come a long way since we were running around Brooklyn. This isn\u2019t internment. It\u2019s treatment.\u2019\n\u2018Treatment?\u2019 Steve demanded. \u2018You said you\u2019ve been here for two years.\u2019\nBucky lifted his eyes, as if exasperated. \u2018Listen, HYDRA\u2019s brainwashing took one to two decades to become successful. Then I was under their control for the better part of the last century. This is not going to be a quick fix. This will take years of therapy to fix.\u2019\n\u2018Yeah, but Tony\u2014\u2019\n\u2018You got a problem with Tony, punk? You liked his dad okay.\u2019\n\u2018Well, Howard was a lot nicer than Tony.\u2019\nBucky smirked. \u2018Not according to a behavioural science documentary.\u2019\n\u2018...What?\u2019\n\u2018Bunch of Harvard students made a documentary comparing Howard\u2019s behavioural patterns and Tony\u2019s at the same age. They\u2019re basically the same person.\u2019\n\u2018No, they\u2019re not. Tony\u2019s a self-involved playboy.\u2019\n\u2018And how much contact have you had with Tony?\u2019\n\u2018I met him about a month after I woke up,\u2019 Steve said.\n\u2018Yeah, I read the incident report.\u2019 Bucky frowned at him. \u2018You knew him for all of four hours and you thought you could judge him.\u2019\n\u2018He disrespected the senate...\u2019\n\u2018When they tried to take possession of his intellectual property. Tony had the right to protect it, especially when they were taking statements and videos out of context to make him look bad.\u2019 Bucky scrutinised him. \u2018I may not have met Tony, but I did kill his parents\u2014\u2019\n\u2018No!\u2019 Steve insisted. \u2018That wasn\u2019t you! It was HYDRA!\u2019\n\u2018If you want to be specific, the order was given by Vasily Karpov, who is currently sitting on death row for that and all the other murders he orchestrated.\u2019 Bucky narrowed his eyes. \u2018Don\u2019t say it wasn\u2019t me because the fact makes you uncomfortable. I may have been the weapon, but it was still my hands that killed them.\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s not your fault!\u2019 Steve insisted. Why couldn\u2019t Bucky get that?\n\u2018That doesn\u2019t make a difference to them.\u2019 Bucky inclined his head. \u2018I heard you told Tony that I was worth ten of him.\u2019\n\u2018Well, you are!\u2019\n\u2018No, he\u2019s worth ten of me.\u2019 Bucky stood up. \u2018I killed his parents and he still decided to help me.\u2019\n\u2018Tony doesn\u2019t know,\u2019 Steve said. And he didn\u2019t have to know. Sure, there was supposed to be a videotape, but he wouldn\u2019t have actually seen Bucky\u2019s face clearly enough to know it was him.\nTo Steve\u2019s surprise, Bucky started laughing. It was like this was the funniest thing he\u2019d ever heard. Soon, though, he recovered himself. Bucky straightened up. \u2018You think Tony doesn\u2019t know? He knows. He\u2019s known since 2005, when Peg ran her mouth off.\u2019\n\u2018...What?\u2019 Steve froze. Tony had known? The whole time?! \u2018Peggy told him?\u2019 The last question came out of his mouth. His voice definitely did not hit a high pitch.\n\u2018From what I heard, she rambles a bit with that Alzheimer\u2019s and she\u2019s not always aware of who\u2019s in the room, listening. Now there\u2019s always someone in there. And the more she talks, the more her reputation dips.\u2019\n\u2018So that\u2019s why people slander her?\u2019 Steve demanded. \u2018Tony blamed her for it?\u2019\n\u2018Slander?\u2019 Bucky asked. \u2018Slander nothing. I know what I did to Howard and his wife, and I know she would have looked at the bodies. She intentionally concealed it.\u2019\n\u2018Peg\u2019s wasn\u2019t like that!\u2019\n\u2018I know you had the hots for her, Steve, but Peg did that. Tony had the right to be angry, especially with how long she and Howard had been friends.\u2019\nBefore Steve could think of anything to say to that \u2013 there had to be something! \u2013 he heard something and spun around. There were uniformed men with guns coming at them. He pulled his shield back to let it fly. But suddenly the shield was yanked out of his hands. Steve looked over his shoulder. Bucky tossed the shield behind him.\n\u2018You\u2019re in enough trouble as it is, punk. You want to add \u201cnegligent homicide\u201d to the list?\u2019\n***\n2029The prisoner was brought into a room, handcuffed, with bars keeping him from one half. On the other side of the bars, there were four armed guards. One of the guards pushed a door open and said something. Vasily Karpov watched as a well-known brunet billionaire walked in. \u2018You know,\u2019 he said, \u2018I was 17 at the time.\u2019\nKarpov cocked his head. \u2018I hope you don\u2019t expect me to feel guilty.\u2019\nTony Stark scoffed. \u2018Of course not. You did this to more than just my parents. Why would you feel guilty?\u2019\n\u2018Then why are you here?\u2019 Karpov asked.\n\u2018Because I wanted to look in the eye the son-of-a-bitch that took my parents away from me when I was just a kid,\u2019 Stark said. He inclined his head. \u2018I could go into detail about what\u2019ll happen to your body when they give you that lethal injection.\u2019\n\u2018But you won\u2019t.\u2019\n\u2018I won\u2019t. I bet you already know. So I\u2019m just gonna look at you, and be satisfied that the next place you go is your deathbed.\u2019\n\u2018And the next place you go?\u2019 Karpov asked.\n\u2018Home.\u2019\n***\nLong Island, NYTony Stark approached a set of headstones, made of marble and with gold leaf engraving.\nHOWARD ANTHONY WALTER STARKAUGUST 15 1917 \u2013 DECEMBER 16 1991REST IN PEACE\nMARIA COLLINS STARKFEBRUARY 12 1931 \u2013 DECEMBER 16 1991REST IN PEACE\n\u2018They can now,\u2019 Tony said softly.\nThe small child next to him looked up. \u2018Why now, daddy?\u2019\nTony smiled down at him. \u2018Because murdered souls can only rest when they receive justice.\u2019 He didn\u2019t know where the idea came from \u2013 likely an incentive to solve murders \u2013 but it was a pervasive one.\nWhether it was true or not didn\u2019t matter to Tony. The ordeal, with Karpov\u2019s execution, was finally over with. The man responsible for his parents\u2019 brutal deaths had been punished with the full power of the law. All those who had sought to cover it up had been punished both in a court of law, and in the court of public opinion. Bucky...well, he could hardly fault the guy for being tortured and brainwashed.
