    "text": "Tony isn\u2019t really the kind of guy who likes to deal with his own mistakes. In his experience, it\u2019s easier (and a hell of a lot less painful) to throw around some cash, flash a few smiles, and let someone else make everything okay. \nBut despite that, he\u2019s never fucked up in a way that resulted in a pregnancy. Even in his early adulthood, which consisted of LSD hallucinations and blackout binge drinking, he\u2019s never slipped up. Not once. Women have contacted his lawyers before, claiming they have his children, but the DNA tests always come back negative. Always.\n\u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u201d Rhodey asks. They\u2019re leaning against the most subtle car Tony has, the one that screams, \u2018I\u2019m rich,\u2019 instead of \u2018I\u2019m really, really rich.\u2019 \n\u201cNo reason,\u201d Tony says casually. He hands over an extra pair of sunglasses and checks his watch.\nRhodey gives Tony an unhappy look. \u201cWe\u2019re standing in front of a high school, Tony. Just break the news to me already.\u201d\nTony ignores Rhodey\u2019s pointed comment. \u201cBe cool, alright?\u201d he asks. \u201cHere he comes.\u201d\nHeads turn all from all around the campus, where students are trickling out into the warm sunlight. Tony has the kind of voice that carries, even over all the hustle and bustle of high school life.\n\u201cTony,\u201d Rhodey hisses, trying to slink back into the car.\n\u201cRelax,\u201d Tony tells him. \u201cWe\u2019re wearing sunglasses. No one knows who we are.\u201d\nA loud, carrying whisper comes from inside the mob of staring students. \u201cHoly shit, is that Tony Stark?\u201d and suddenly everyone\u2019s looking, trying to get a peek at the car and the two men leaning against it.\nRhodey wants to die.\nA brown haired, somewhat attractive kid makes eye contact with Rhodey and goes rigid. His eyes move from Rhodey to the car to Tony. His jaw goes slack, and he ducks his head and shoves his way through the mob of frozen students towards them.\n\u201cParker,\u201d Tony says coolly. \u201cExcellent timing. We were just talking about you.\u201d\nRhodey clenches his teeth, because like hell Tony is getting off that easily.\n\u201cMr. Stark,\u201d says the kid (Parker?) fiddling with the straps of his backpack. \u201cWow. This is, like, a huge surprise. What are you doing here? It\u2019s Wednesday.\u201d\n\u201cNice to see you too, kid,\u201d says Tony, adjusting his sunglasses. \u201cWe were in the neighborhood, and I wanted to make sure you met Rhodey here.\u201d\nNo, Rhodey wants to say. They were not in the neighborhood, they spent fourty-five minutes driving into the middle of Queens to pick up a random high school student Rhodey has never heard of before.\nInstead, he says, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d\nThe kid turns to face him, and his jaw drops. \u201cYou\u2019re the Iron Patriot,\u201d he says.\n\u201cWar machine,\u201d corrects Tony.\n\u201cLet\u2019s talk about this in the car, Tony,\u201d Rhodey says through gritted teeth. \u201cTony, children are staring at us. They\u2019re staring at us, Tony.\u201d\n\u201cRight, let\u2019s go,\u201d Tony says, gesturing the kid and Rhodey into the car with a dramatic flourish.\n\u201cHey, Happy,\u201d says Peter brightly as he gets in the car. \u201cI like your haircut.\u201d\nHappy grunts unhappily from the driver\u2019s seat.\n\u201cHe\u2019s not feeling particularly chatty, kid,\u201d Tony says, pulling out his Starkphone. \u201cHe\u2019s had a rough day. Did you hear about the hack?\u201d\nPeter\u2019s eyes light up. \u201cOh my god, it was beautiful,\u201d he says, and Rhodey swears if his voice gets any higher it will crack from prepubescent strain. \u201cWe studied some of the coding in Comp-sci, and it was magnificent. They\u2019re saying it didn\u2019t just get through Oscorp\u2019s firewall, it completely destroyed it!\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t I know it, kid,\u201d grunts Happy. \u201cPR nightmare.\u201d\nPeter shoots a quick look at Tony and starts firing questions. \u201cWhy does it have anything to do with Stark Industries?\u201d\n\u201cEveryone thinks we were the ones who created the hack. You know, to take our main competition out of the market, etcetera etcetera.\u201d Tony snaps up his glasses and stares at Peter. \u201cMind you, Oscorp is crap, so it\u2019s not like we needed to do anything. Their tech speaks for itself-,\u201d\n\u201cBut did you do it?\u201d Peter asks excitedly.\n\u201cTony,\u201d Rhodey says quickly, because even though he\u2019s had a little trouble following the conversation, it seems like this kid could get Tony in some legal trouble if he wanted to. \u201cI strongly advise you not to answer.\u201d\nTony waves him aside with a flick of his hand. \u201cQuiet, Rhodes. I'm extremely proud of that coding, like hell I'm going to let someone else take credit.\u201d\n\u201cTony!\u201d Rhodey exclaims. \u201cJesus Christ. It\u2019s like you want to get your ass sued off.\u201d\n\u201cFirst off,\u201d says Tony, \u201cLanguage.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, you heard him say \u2018language\u2019 to me too, right?\u201d Rhodey asked Peter. \u201cThe word \u2018language\u2019 just came out of his mouth, directed at me.\u201d\nPeter\u2019s jaw goes slack. \u201cYou\u2019re the Iron Patriot,\u201d he says again. \n\"Yes, I\u2019m . . .\u201d says Rhodey. \u201cI\u2019m . . . ugh. Tony. Explain.\u201d\n\u201cHere\u2019s your stop, kid,\u201d Tony says. Happy stops the car in front of some shitty apartment building that looks like it\u2019s a light breeze away from keeling over. \n\u201cThanks for the ride, Mr. Stark,\u201d says Peter happily. \n\u201cLike I said, kid,\u201d says Tony, putting his sunglasses back on with a flourish. \u201cWe were in the neighborhood.\u201d\nRhodey coughs.\n\u201cGoodbye, Mr. Iron Patriot, Sir. It was an honor to meet you,\u201d says Peter, and then suddenly he\u2019s gone, the door of the car slamming behind him.\n\u201cStep on it, Happy,\u201d says Tony, glancing at his watch. \u201cI want to get back to the compound before Pepper gets home.\u201d\nHe pulls out his phone and starts to scroll though his email. Rhodey\u2019s hand reaches out before he can stop it, swatting Tony\u2019s phone onto the car floor.\n\u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d fumes Rhodey. \u201cTony, what the actual fuck.\u201d\n\u201cDid you just let your annoyance manifest into physical aggression? You\u2019re going to be a terrible role model for poor Peter.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d\n\u201cI wanted you to meet him,\u201d says Tony, leaning down to pick up his phone, slightly annoyed. \u201cHe\u2019s a good kid, Rhodey. Like, a really good kid. He\u2019s crazy smart, he even comes down to the labs once in a while to help me with tech.\u201d\n\u201cWhich brings us back to my question,\u201d repeats Rhodey, a note of panic in his voice. \u201cWhat the fuck? You still haven\u2019t answered me, Tones.\u201d\nRhodey hasn\u2019t felt this much panic since the memorable night when Tony drank his way through four bottles of vodka. Or, as Pepper calls it, the Great Stomach Pumping of 2005.\n\u201cThe kid is a genius,\u201d says Tony tiredly. \u201cSometimes I even wonder . . . not the point. He\u2019s a genuinely good person with no self-preservation tendencies. Do I have to spell it out for you?\u201d\nRhodey\u2019s brain short-circuits.\n\u201cRhodes,\u201d says Tony quietly. \u201cGermany.\u201d\nRhodey vaguely remembers a night, sometime around Tony\u2019s twenty-fifth birthday, when they hit an all-night rave in Berlin. He distantly remembers meeting a woman there, holding a picture of a one year old, who claimed that Tony had gotten her pregnant two years before. Rhodey had shooed her away from them and given them Tony\u2019s lawyer\u2019s phone number. He\u2019d never followed up.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Rhodey says in a hushed voice. \u201cTony, tell me you didn\u2019t . . .\u201d\n\u201cWhat happened was in the past,\u201d Tony says firmly. \u201cThere are days when I regret it, of course, because when it comes down to it he\u2019s just a kid. But I don\u2019t regret meeting him, Rhodey.\u201d\nRhodey\u2019s jaw opens slightly.\nHe wants to get angry; there\u2019s a little part of him that wants to hulk out at Tony, rage at him for being so fucking irresponsible.\n\u201cDoes Pepper know?\u201d he asks finally.\n\u201cShe knows he\u2019s my intern,\u201d says Tony. \u201cI haven\u2019t told anyone else his other identity. He says he wants to keep it a secret. People could target the people he cares about, if they knew.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019ve done tests on him in the lab,\u201d Rhodey says. \u201cYou\u2019ve made absolutely sure . . . Tony. We have to be absolutely sure.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s a person, not a science experiment,\u201d Tony snaps. \u201cJesus. Of course I\u2019ve done basic DNA tests, tried to learn as much about his genetics and body-chemistry as I can.\u201d\nThat seems a little overboard, even for Tony, but Rhodey figures they are talking about his son. \nHis son.\nJesus Christ.\n\u00a0\n---\n\u00a0\nWhen Rhodey shows up at the compound a week later, FRIDAY informs him that Tony and Peter are in the medbay.\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d sighs Rhodey. \u201cScience experiment gone wrong?\u201d\n\u201cPeter has two rounds in his lower abdomen,\u201d says FRIDAY helpfully.\nThe bag of Chinese takeout Rhodey is holding crashes to the floor.\n\u201cRounds?\u201d he demands. \u201cLike, bullets?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d says FRIDAY. \u201cDo you have any other questions?\u201d\nRhodey is already sprinting to the elevator, the takeout food forgotten on the floor. How could a sixteen year old kid have managed to get shot in the seven days since Rhodey\u2019s last seen him?\n(Alright, Rhodey reasons with himself. This is Tony\u2019s kid. Rhodey is just thankful the kid hasn\u2019t decided to follow in daddy\u2019s footsteps and fight crime in a homemade super suit.)\nHe throws the door of the medbay open. Peter\u2019s shirt is rolled up to his belly button. He\u2019s lying on one of the beds. Bruce is leaning over him, peeling some gnarly white stuff off of Peter\u2019s abdomen. Tony is leaning against the wall, phone out, trying desperately not to look like a mother hen.\n\u201cHey, Mr. Rhodes,\u201d says Peter cheerfully. \u201cI got shot. Twice.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the actual\u2014,\u201d\nTony looks ready to explode. \u201cAnd instead of calling for help like any rational preteen would do, he made the executive decision to dig the bullets out on the roof of a church with his eyebrow tweezers.\u201d\n\u201cThey were actually May\u2019s\u2014,\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d says Tony. His eyes flash dangerously as he sets his phone down. \u201cAre we actually debating the owner of the eyebrow tweezers you used to dig two bullets out of your stomach?\u201d\nRhodey hears himself make a noise somewhere between a whimper and a laugh.\nBruce glances up at him, amused. \u201cThis stuff happens more often than you\u2019d think,\u201d he tells Rhodey. \u201cI\u2019ve kind of just resigned myself to being this kid\u2019s full time doctor.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re so cool!\u201d says Peter excitedly. He tries to sit up, but Banner puts a hand on his chest and pushes him back down. \u201cMr. Rhodes, have you read Bruce\u2019s papers? His work with gamma radiation is iconic. I can\u2019t believe\u2014,\u201d\n\u201cTony!\u201d says Rhodey, completely at his wits end. \u201cCan someone tell me why no one seems to be surprised that there is a child bleeding out on that table?\u201d\nBruce, Peter, and Tony all stare at him, confused.\n\u201cI thought you told him,\u201d says Peter.\n\u201cI did,\u201d says Tony carefully. \n\u201cI know you\u2019re his kid,\u201d says Rhodey, trying very hard to make his tone sound flippant, as though it hasn\u2019t kept him up every night for the past seven days. \u201cIt makes sense. I actually met your mom, in that club in Germany, and she seemed legit\u2014,\u201d\n\u201cStop talking,\u201d says Tony, holding up a hand with a horrified expression on his face. \u201cOh my fucking . . . Rhodey, darling, there has been a terrible miscommunication between us.\u201d\nPeter is staring between the two of them, his mouth slightly open. Bruce is frozen. Blood is oozing out of Peter\u2019s abdomen at an alarming rate, but no one seems to be concerned. \n\u201cWhat . . .\u201d Rhodey trails off.\n\u201cRhodey,\u201d says Tony formally, his voice slightly higher than usual. \u201cMeet Spiderman. He fought with us in Germany. That was the time I was referring to. You . . . you actually thought . . .\u201d\n\u201cSo he\u2019s not yours,\u201d Rhodey clarifies. His airway feels more open than it has in days. \u201cWait. Please tell me you didn\u2019t just say that he was Spiderman.\u201d\nPeter laughs nervously.\nTony glances over at him, smiling slightly. The smile drops off his face immediately, and his eyes widen comically.\n\u201cBruce! He\u2019s bleeding out on my fucking table!\u201d\nEver since the Germany incident, Tony has pretty much had the tower to himself. The Avengers have scattered into the wind; Rhodey stays over, sometimes, but he\u2019s active duty and never stays anywhere too long. Vision keeps to himself. Tony occasionally will see him cooking or reading, but for the most part he\u2019s pretty private about his quest to become a real boy.\nWhen the Avengers move back into the tower, it\u2019s more of a trickle-in system then a fully-fledged moving spree. Tony wakes up one morning and Natasha is in his living room, in a tank top and pajama bottoms, sipping tea and reading a book like she owns the place.\n\u201cSo that\u2019s it?\u201d Tony asks. \u201cYou\u2019re just moving back in?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m taking a break from Sam and Steve,\u201d is all she says. She tilts her head, looking up at him. \u201cPepper didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d\n\u201cYou talked to Pepper and not me?\u201d he says sardonically. \u201cYou do realize this is my house, right? You can\u2019t just come and go as it pleases you.\u201d\n\u201cPepper says it\u2019s only sixteen percent your house.\u201d\nTony rolls his eyes, because he really doesn\u2019t think that\u2019s fair and Pepper needs to let that one comment from four years ago go. \nNatasha raises her eyebrows. \u201cDo you not want me to move back in?\u201d\n\u201cI . . .\u201d Tony pauses. He has to tread carefully, because if he says something that pisses her off there\u2019s a real possibility that he will never see her again. \u201cOkay, of course I want you here. But I need a favor.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not killing anyone for you. Unless they deserve it.\u201d \n\u201cWhat? No!\u201d Tony says. \u201cNot that kind of favor. Jesus.\u201d\nNatasha raises her eyebrows.\n\u201cI need your experience. Lessons,\u201d Tony clarifies at her confused expression. \u201cIn hand to hand combat.\u201d\nNatasha\u2019s lips quiver suspiciously. \u201cYou want me to teach you how to fight.\u201d\n\u201cNot exactly. I\u2014,\u201d\n\u201cIf this is some new kink you have, Stark, I swear to god\u2014,\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll have you know, I\u2019m an engaged man,\u201d Tony says, raising his eyebrows. \u201cAnd besides, the lessons aren\u2019t for me. They\u2019re for the vigilant who fought with us in Germany. He got himself shot a few weeks ago, so I\u2019ve decided it\u2019s time to get him some actual training instead of letting him fend for himself against local criminals.\u201d\n\u201cThe one from Queens,\u201d Natasha says, narrowing her eyes. \u201cToo chatty. Exuberant. Can\u2019t throw a punch to save his life?\u201d\n\u201cI kind of feel obligated to defend him, but you raise some good points.\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d says Natasha. \u201cDeal.\u201d\nIt\u2019s surprising, how easily Natasha fits herself back into his life. It\u2019s nice, having someone around the house when Pepper\u2019s gone and Vision is doing god knows what. \nA few days after she moves in, Natasha orders Chinese food and brings some down to his lab, and they eat together and talk about unimportant, trivial matters.\nThey talk about Germany a bit. He asks about Clint, she asks about Rhodey\u2019s PT. They don\u2019t talk about Steve, or Sam, or the Winter Soldier.\n\u201cShould I be worried about Spiderman\u2019s secrecy?\u201d she asks in between bites of fried rice.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Tony says. \u201cHe\u2019s a good kid. Better than I was, anyway.\u201d\n\u201cHow old is he?\u201d\nTony figures there\u2019s really no point denying it\u2014Natasha will find out whether he tells her or not, and he knows what it feels like to find out people are keeping important information from you.\n\u201cHe\u2019s not legally allowed to vote.\u201d\nHe expects Natasha to verbally berate him for recruiting a kid, but she just shrugs. \u201cI thought so.\u201d \n\u201cHe fights okay, all things considered,\u201d Tony says.\nNatasha tilts her head. \u201cYes,\u201d she agrees. \u201cThank you for telling me.\u201d\nThe rest of the Avengers trickle into the compound soon after Natasha. Three nights later, Friday alerts him that someone has spent the night with Vision in his room. Tony makes a point to reestablish with Friday what constitutes as a \u2018threat,\u2019 because he really doesn\u2019t want to hear about Vision\u2019s \u2018intimate relations.\u2019\nHe\u2019s not surprised when he finds Wanda in the kitchen in the morning.\nShe gives him a tight smile. He returns it.\nEveryone else comes all at once after that, except for Steve and Sam. And suddenly, the tower isn\u2019t empty and lonely anymore. He walks into the game room to find Clint and Natasha playing call of duty, and can\u2019t go three feet without tripping over someone\u2019s shoes or clothes or pistols. And it\u2019s nice, the company.\n\u00a0\n---\n\u00a0\nNatasha corners him not long after. \u201cI\u2019m free this Thursday,\u201d she tells him.\nTony is a little busy trying to keep Dum-ee away from the kerosene, so it takes a minute for him to absorb what she\u2019s saying.\n\u201cI\u2019m flattered, but I\u2019m actually in a relationship right now,\u201d Tony says.\nNatasha glares at him. \u201cSpiderman,\u201d she says through gritted teeth. \u201cYou wanted me to teach him how to fight.\u201d\nIn all honesty, Tony had forgotten about her promise, but just last night the Baby Monitor Protocol informed him that Peter had cracked two ribs, so it\u2019s probably best to cash in.\n\u201cThursday,\u201d Tony agrees.\n\u201cFour to six,\u201d says Natasha, and she\u2019s left his lab before he can even confirm.\n\u00a0\n---\n\u00a0\nOn Thursday, when Peter comes bounding into the compound, Happy in tow, he looks like Christmas has come early.\n\u201cHappy says that I\u2019ll get fighting lessons today,\u201d says Peter, and Tony braces himself for the fanboying that will inevitably burst forth.\n\u201cHi, nice to see you too,\u201d Tony says, not looking up from the suit Peter hands to him. \u201cJesus, kid, what happened here?\u201d \nThe suit has a long gash running down the front, probably in the same place where Peter\u2019s two broken ribs are currently healing.\nPeter winces. \u201cSorry,\u201d he says, deflating slightly.\n\u201cDo I even . . . no, I don\u2019t want to know,\u201d says Tony firmly. \u201cNat\u2019s waiting for us down in the gym, I can fix this later.\u201d\nPeter\u2019s eyes widen comically.\n\u201cNat?\u201d he says. \u201cLike, Natasha Romanov? The Black Widow is going to teach me how to fight?\u201d\n\u201cI called in a few favors,\u201d Tony says, brushing it off.\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d says Peter, thrilled. \u201cI\u2019m going to die.\u201d\n\u00a0\n___\n\u00a0\nHe doesn\u2019t die.\nHe actually lasts about twenty seconds, which surprises Tony to no end. But then Natasha stops going easy on him, and he\u2019s flat on his back almost instantly.\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d wheezes Peter, the wind completely knocked out of him. \u201cThis is the best day of my life.\u201d\nNatasha stares at him, perplexed.\nPeter\u2019s gone down six more times by the time Tony finishes his fourth game of flappy bird. When he looks up, Peter is curled up in a ball on the floor. Natasha is standing over him, looking amused.\n\u201cWhat did you do to him?\u201d Tony demands.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to test out that new Widow Bite for ages,\u201d Natasha says, smirking at him.\n\u201cYou tased him?\u201d Tony demands. \u201cHis aunt is going to kill me.\u201d\nPeter moans loudly from the ground. When he rolls over, he still has a huge smile on his face. Either that, or his facial muscles are spasming.\n\u201cWasn\u2019t fair,\u201d he mumbles into the mats. \u201cI almos\u2019 had you.\u201d\n\u201cDo you think the criminals in Queens are going to play fair?\u201d Natasha asks dangerously. \u201cDo you think they\u2019re going to say, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s just a kid, guess we should go easy on him?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for seven months,\u201d Peter slurs into the mats. \u201cI\u2019ve never been tased before.\u201d\nIf Tony didn\u2019t know Natasha so well, he\u2019d say she looked amused.\n\u201cAlright,\u201d she says, and she\u2019s defiantly smiling. \u201cGet up, Underoos. Let\u2019s go again.\u201d\n\u00a0\n---\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou like him,\u201d Tony accuses after Peter leaves.\nNatasha glares at him. She grabs a towel and exits the gym. Tony follows her, smirking.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Tony says, giving her a condescending pat on the back. \u201cHe has a way of growing on you.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good sport,\u201d Natasha agrees. \u201cAnd he learns quickly.\u201d\n\u201cNot quickly enough,\u201d mutters Tony. \u201cDid I tell you he got shot two weeks ago? Scared me and Rhodey half to death.\u201d\n\u201cYou mentioned it,\u201d Natasha says. Her eyes fall down to the ground.\n\u201cThanks for letting me meet your kid,\u201d she tells him. \u201cAnd for being upfront with me. Rhodey says you tried to pass him off as yours instead of telling the truth.\u201d\nThe smile slides of Tony\u2019s face. \u201cThat\u2019s actually not what went down at all. Rhodey is a filthy liar, who completely misinterpreted\u2014,\u201d\n\u201cStop while you\u2019re ahead, Stark.\u201d\n\u00a0\n---\n\u00a0\nAnd if Natasha makes a point to say hi to Peter every time he\u2019s at the compound, well. Who is Tony to judge?\nThe aliens that are currently invading Manhattan are extremely nonthreatening. In fact, they\u2019re so easy to beat up that Tony has no idea why Dr. Strange felt the need to call in the Avengers for backup.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that they\u2019re a problem,\u201d says Strange shortly when Tony tries to make fun of him for needing help. \u201cThey\u2019re scouts. They\u2019re gaging Earth\u2019s defenses for something bigger. I want whoever\u2019s out there to know that we\u2019re no joke.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a distressing statement.\nThe alien-robots invading are so pathetic that Tony feels a little bad beating them up. They don\u2019t even have guns, they just have long metal poles that they swing around mechanically. They also make adorable distressed beeps when they\u2019re being crushed to bits by the Avengers.\n\u201cCall the kid,\u201d Rhodey tells Tony over comms. \u201cThis is pretty much as safe as it gets. It will be good practice for him.\u201d\n\u201c\u2019The Kid,\u2019\u201d Roger echoes, amused. \u201cSome superhero name.\u201d\nNo one bothers to correct him, but Tony does make the call.\nPeter shows up twenty minutes later, swinging into the scene with enough energy to put them all to shame.\n\u201cHey,\u201d says Steve, finally understanding, when he catches sight of him. \u201cQueens, right?\u201d\nPeter is practically hyperventilating with excitement. \u201cHey, man! I\u2019m a big fan. Remember that time I stole your shield?\u201d\n\u201cStay close to the ground,\u201d Tony instructs him through the comms. He can\u2019t see Peter, but he can hear him trying to engage the aliens in conversation (Tony doesn\u2019t say anything, because he knows that it\u2019s annoying Steve more than it\u2019s annoying him.) \u201cHelp civilians, take out aliens. Don\u2019t do anything stupid.\u201d\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d says Peter. \u201cHey, quick question. Morally speaking\u2014,\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to stop you right there,\u201d Tony says, blasting his way through a dozen aliens at once. \u201cIf a question needs to be started with the words \u2018morally speaking,\u2019 the answer is automatically no. New rule.\u201d\n\u201cBut would it be morally okay to take a few of these robot carcasses with us? We could figure out how the alien tech works!\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t call them carcasses,\u201d says Strange, annoyed. His voice sounds oddly tinny through the comms.\n\u201cCadavers, then.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re not\u2014,\u201d Tony breaks off. \u201cKid, just . . . don\u2019t mess with the dead aliens. Please.\u201d\n(He's not smiling. He's not.)\n\u00a0\n---\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe has good instincts. He kept part of a building from collapsing on me, today. I wouldn\u2019t have noticed until it was too late,\u201d says Wanda quietly to Tony on the tense, silent Hellicarrier ride back to the tower. \n(Stark tower? Avenger\u2019s Tower? Tony doesn\u2019t really know what it\u2019s called anymore. He doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s either.)\nTony glances at Peter, curled up in a ball on his seat, masked face buried between his knees. Tony knows him well enough to safely assume that Peter can here every word anyone on the plane says, regardless of how low they keep their voices.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Tony says, \u201cSpidey-sense, patent pending. It\u2019s a real thing.\u201d\nWanda gives him an approving look.\nHe raises his eyebrows at her, silently asking the question he\u2019s afraid to hear the answer of.\n\u201cOf course I know,\u201d she murmurs, lips barely parting. She leans in closer, as if she\u2019s whispering a secret in his ear. \u201cI won\u2019t tell any of his secrets. Don\u2019t worry. You can trust me.\u201d\nTony\u2019s gone to extreme lengths to protect the kid\u2019s identity. Legally speaking, there is absolutely no way to tie Spiderman back to Peter Parker. He swore to himself that no one, not even the Avengers, could ever be trusted with a secret this important (besides Rhodey, of course. But isn\u2019t Rhodey always the exception? And Nat. But she doesn\u2019t count, really, because she would\u2019ve found out anyway.)\nBut, even after everything that\u2019s happened, he does trust Wanda. He sees in her eyes that she\u2019d die for Peter, the same way she\u2019d die for Steve or Vision.\nAnd maybe even him.\nHe may not get along with Clint. He might still have a little resentment for Natasha. He might hate Steve in ways that it will be impossible to let go of. But he trusts them all, every single one.\nAnd he sure as hell trusts Peter Parker and his crazy instincts.\n\u00a0\n---\n\u00a0\n The conference room is tense. It\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve had an official meeting since the split. Tony really wishes he\u2019d made a seating chart, because watching the team awkwardly segregate back into Team-Cap and Team-Tony is a little hard to swallow.\nRhodey sits in the seat on his right hand side, like they\u2019re all fighting the way they were six months ago (are they? Tony doesn\u2019t really know anymore.) Tony gestures to the seat on his other side when the kid comes in, still wearing his suit and mask. The eyes of the suit widen comically.\n\u201cDamn, kid, be cool,\u201d Tony says, as the kid scrambles to sit on Tony\u2019s left-hand side.\n\u201cI\u2019m cool, I\u2019m cool,\u201d Peter says. \u201cI\u2019m, like, the coolest\u2014,\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t finish that sentence if I were you, little spider,\u201d Wanda says kindly, taking her seat at the other end of the table, by Steve.\nThe unmentioned barrier is broken when Natasha slides down besides Rhodey. She\u2019s somehow managed to change into a cocktail dress, and Tony has no idea where she got it from.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Rhodey says pointedly. \u201cNo team Cap on this side of the table.\u201d\nNatasha gives him a look and pulls a gun out of god knows where. She begins to polish it, nonchalant and cool as a cucumber.\n\u201cI\u2019m not team Cap,\u201d she tells him smoothly. \u201cI\u2019m not on your team, either, for that matter. I\u2019m on team Natasha. Always have been.\u201d\n\u201cHey, nice gun,\u201d Peter tells her. \u201cIt\u2019s super badass. I actually don\u2019t really like guns, mostly because there\u2019s too much gun violence in the US, though. But I mean, you\u2019re obviously not the kind of person who would, like, shoot up a school, so I guess\u2014,\u201d\nNatasha\u2019s smiles slightly when she looks at him. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you again. I assume you had fun today?\u201d\nThe eyes of the suit widen. \u201cOh my fucking . . . did you see the aliens, Nat? It was so lit.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d says Sam snarkily to Peter, entering the room and sliding into the seat to the right of Cap. \u201cWho are you, again?\u201d\nPeter deflates under his piercing stare. \u201cUnderoos?\u201d he says helplessly, the end of his sentence turning up like a question.\n\u201cYou talk a lot,\u201d Steve says. He raises an eyebrow. \u201cWhy are you still wearing your mask?\u201d\n\u201cHey,\u201d Tony snaps. \u201cStop interrogating the kid. Take it easy.\u201d\n\u201cNo, Steve has a point,\u201d says Sam. He\u2019s more curious than aggressive, but it still rubs Tony the wrong way. \u201cWhy is he wearing the mask still?\u201d \n\u201cMaybe he\u2019s horribly disfigured,\u201d Clint suggests. He turns to Wanda. \u201cHow many Pringles do you think I can fit in my mouth?\u201d\n\u201cUm, no,\u201d said Tony, moving the can of Pringles far out of harm\u2019s way. \u201cI just got this carpet dry cleaned, thank you very much.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Peter says at the same time. The eyes of the mask squint as everyone turns to look at him. \u201cHorribly disfigured, I mean. At least, I don\u2019t think I am.\u201d\n\u201cThen take the mask off,\u201d urges Steve. \u201cYou can trust us.\u201d\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you seen The Incredibles?\u201d Peter rambles. \u201cSecret identities, and all that jazz. Oh my god, the sequel just came out, it was fantastic . . .\u201d \nThey don\u2019t have a chance to discuss the matter further, because Dr. Strange enters with an expression so serious it makes Tony feel depressed.\nAnd then they\u2019re talking about Thanos, aliens, and infinity stones, and Tony realizes there was a second when he forgot there was anything more important than keeping Pringles off his carpet and secret identities.\n\u00a0\n---\n\u00a0\nTony thought that would be the end of it. \nThere was no reason for the Avengers to meet Peter Parker, because Peter made the conscious decision not to move up to the major leagues. Tony just assumed that there wouldn\u2019t be another run-in for a few years. At the very least, six months. \nBut, of course, Peter is absolute shit at staying on the down low.\nThe headline catches Tony\u2019s attention as soon as he turns on his Stark phone. \nWell, not the headline, exactly. Scarlett Witch spotted with a new man. Has Vision been Unplugged from Her Life? is so obviously clickbait that it almost makes Tony roll his eyes and swipe it off his screen without looking at the picture.\nAlmost. \nBut the image of Peter Parker catches his attention before he can do so, and suddenly Tony\u2019s heart is beating fast enough to power an entire building.\nShit.\nThe picture is of Peter and Wanda (Peter, not Spiderman,) casually leaning against the side of a building, both holding Starbucks. They look like they\u2019re in the middle of a conversation; Wanda is rolling her eyes. Peter is laughing, his eyes bright.\nTony\u2019s calling Peter before he can even wrap his head around what he\u2019s doing.\n\u201cMisser\u2019 Stark?\u201d Peter\u2019s voice sounds raspy and low, and instantly Tony is on high alert.\n\u201cKid? You okay?\u201d\nThere\u2019s a slight pause.\n\u201cIt\u2019s three in the morning,\u201d Peter says, sounding slightly more alert. \u201cI was sleeping.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d says Tony in surprise, glancing at the clock on the wall of his lab. Huh. He must\u2019ve gotten carried away working on the Iron Spider suit.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Peter asks. \u201cMission?\u201d\n(He always asks that, when Tony calls. It hurts more than Tony is willing to admit.)\n\u201cNo,\u201d says Tony casually. \u201cHey, fun story. Buzzfeed seems to think you and Scarlet Witch hang out regularly. Crazy, right?\u201d\nThere\u2019s a pause on the other end of the phone.\n\u201cI saw the picture,\u201d Peter admits. \u201cIt\u2019s just clickbait, though, you know that.\u201d\n\u201cWhy the hell were you having coffee with Wanda?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re friends,\u201d says Peter offhandedly.\nTony\u2019s brain is having a little trouble working, so he slides onto the sofa that\u2019s shoved into the corner of his lab and buries his face in his free hand.\n\u201cFriends,\u201d he echos.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d says Peter, sounding unnerved by the edge in Tony\u2019s voice. \u201cWe . . . we hang out. Why does that upset you?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2014exactly\u2014do you do?\u201d says Tony, trying very hard to be patient.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d says Peter, sounding more annoyed then Tony has ever heard him. \u201cWe braid each other\u2019s hair. Talk about boys. What 'exactly' do you do with your friends?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not joking,\u201d says Tony, his voice hard.\n\u201cNeither am I,\u201d says Peter coolly. \u201cShe hangs out with us after decathlon, all right? She watches Star Wars with Ned and me, and she gets along great with MJ, almost too well, really, but that\u2019s not the point. And . . . I don\u2019t know, we just hang out, there\u2019s no other way to put it.\u201d\n\u201cHow long has this been going on?\u201d Tony demands.\n\u201cSince those weird robot-aliens invaded last week,\u201d Peter says. \u201cWhy are you so bugged out by this? She\u2019s really nice.\u201d\n\u201cAre we even talking about the same person?\u201d says Tony harshly. \u201cI beat her at Uno once, and she told me that she sincerely hoped my death was painful and full of agony. She\u2019s not a good person, Pete, not like\u2014,\u201d\nHe trails off before he can say something stupid, like \u2018you.\u2019\n\u201cYes, she is,\u201d Peter says quietly.\nTony wants to dig in his heels. He wants to keep Peter far away from Wanda, because the fact of the matter is she\u2019s dangerous. But telling Peter about all the things Wanda has done isn\u2019t really fair to her, he supposes.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Tony says finally.\n\u201cOkay?\u201d\n\u201cBut I\u2019m still your favorite Avenger,\u201d Tony says firmly. \u201cSay it. Say, \u2018Iron Man is and always will be my favorite Avenger.\u2019\u201d\nPeter laughs, but says it anyway.\n(When Peter shows up at the tower the next day, he\u2019s visiting Wanda, not Tony. Tony animatedly refuses the offer to join them for a Pretty Little Liars marathon. He\u2019s not that far gone.)\nClint likes making lists. \nFirstly, because it\u2019s a good way to express himself. His therapist doesn\u2019t like most of his coping mechanisms\u2014he went through a phase where his self-expression mainly consisted of tracking down, torturing, and putting down hydra agents, which was, according to his therapist, unhealthy and obsessive.\n\u201cIt\u2019s art,\u201d Clint had said firmly.\n\u201cIt\u2019s assassination,\u201d his therapist, Neil, had corrected. \nWhatever.\nSecondly, the lists help him keep track of every single detail. Neil says it\u2019s a way to store the obsessions; the little ticks he has that make him Clint. Clint just likes everything to have its place in the world. Because if it doesn\u2019t have a place, it shouldn\u2019t exist.\n\u201cThat\u2019s . . . an odd way to look at the world,\u201d Neil the therapist had told him carefully.\n\u201cYou\u2019re an odd way to look at the world,\u201d Clint had snapped back. He felt judged. Clint does not like to feel judged.\nLaura put up with it for a while. She was good like that. She\u2019d tolerated the lists, and the obsessions, and the whole gotta-go-save-the-world-now bullshit he\u2019d been putting her and the kids through for years. \nBut then there was an incident with a list, Nathaniel, one of Clint\u2019s pistols, and a can of Aresol Spray Whipped Cream that resulted in Clint standing in front of Stark Tower with two packed suitcases.\n\u201cI need a place to crash for a few nights,\u201d Clint tells a very confused Tony as he makes his way through the living quarters.\n\u201cNo, totally,\u201d Tony responds, but there\u2019s an edge to his voice as he takes Clint\u2019s suitcases from him. \u201cHotel Trivago is open for business.\u201d\nClint actually likes Tony okay, because; 1) Tony is a self-sacrificing bastard, who hides all the good parts of him under a layer of sarcastic narcissism. 2) However pissed off Tony is at the Rogues, he\u2019s the kind of man who would rather eat a bullet then burn bridges. And, 3) Tony has always been good to Clint. \nSure, they\u2019ve never been really tight, but they both love three things: alcohol, Natasha, and world peace. So how hard can bonding be?\n\u201cThanks for letting me crash here,\u201d says Clint cheerfully, removing one of the panels in the wall so he can set up camp in one of the vents. \u201cHey, how\u2019s world peace coming along?\u201d\nTony\u2019s lips quiver angrily as he glares at Clint over the top of his phone. Clint realizes too late that Tony might think he\u2019s being made fun of. Oops.\n\u201cWhat I meant was, uh . . .\u201d Clint sets the vent cover down on the floor as his mind scrambles to find a new topic to bond over. \u201cHave you . . . drank . . . any good alcohol lately?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m four months sober,\u201d says Tony coldly. \nOh.\n\u201cHow . . . bout . . . Natasha?\u201d says Clint, a little desperately, as he positions his shoulders just right so he can shimmy into the vent.\nTony, apparently, is done with Clint\u2019s rambling. \u201cYou know you have a bedroom, right? You don\u2019t have to dissect my wall to make room for yourself.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Clint says firmly, reaching down to grab his backpack so he can pull it through the vent, too. \u201cI like vents. I prefer them, really. I usually sleep in the vents at home, too.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t imagine why Laura kicked you out,\u201d Tony mutters. \n\u201cRight?\u201d says Clint, but he knows why Laura decided enough was enough. He\u2019s already made a list of all the reasons.\n\u00a0\n---\n\u00a0\nClint meets Peter the next day.\nHe wakes up early\u2014early enough that the sun still hasn\u2019t illuminated his vent. It takes him a while to shimmy out, and somehow he ends up in a random bedroom instead of the living room.\nIt\u2019s not a bedroom that Clint recognizes, so he assumes it must be empty. So he pops the vent board off the wall and shimmies out, tucking into a roll when he hits the ground.\nIt takes him approximately half a second to realize that the room is not empty. There is someone in the bed.\nClint has done a lot of incredible things in his life. 1) He singlehandedly tracked down and destroyed an entire hydra cartel. 2) He gained the trust of the Black Widow. 3) He challenged six Olympic archers to archery competitions, and beat the four that accepted. 4) He successfully completed the Saltine challenge.\nSo, needless to say, he has lots of life experience. He doesn\u2019t hesitate, he doesn\u2019t, he just . . . pauses, for a second. To watch the steady rise and fall of the mystery-person\u2019s breathing.\nThen he looks around the room.\nIt\u2019s a nice bedroom. The king bed makes mystery-person look like a child, it dwarfs him so much. There are Stark Wars and I Love Iron Man posters decorating all the walls. There\u2019s a desk, messy with lots of spare parts, sheets, and science textbooks. There\u2019s an unfinished cup of hot chocolate on the dresser, and dirty clothes in a pile by the head of the bed.\nIt\u2019s not that the room is messy; there\u2019s an orderly chaos vibe that Clint can dig. He has the urge to clean up after mystery-person, but he stops himself. He\u2019s not mystery-person\u2019s dad. He\u2019s doesn\u2019t get to be a dad to every person he meets just because he\u2019s not allowed to see his kids until Laura cools off.\nStill. Clint decides he likes mystery-person, because 1) mystery-person seems to like hot chocolate, and Natasha likes hot chocolate, and Clint likes Natasha. 2) Mystery-person has yet to fly into a towering rage at Clint for accidentally breaking-and-entering his bedroom, and 3) any person who has a heart shaped poster of Harrison Ford is a friend of Clint\u2019s.\nThen mystery-person mumbles something in his sleep, and rolls over onto his back. And every part of Clint\u2019s brain freezes, because mystery-person is not a person.\nMystery-person is a kid.\n\u00a0\n---\n\u00a0\nWhen Tony wakes up to find Clint\u2019s face hovering half an inch above his, he doesn\u2019t scream. Instead, Clint is blasted backwards at an alarmingly violent speed. He slams into a wall a good twenty feet away from the bed and slides down, slightly dazed.\nAlright. He deserved that.\n\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Tony snarles, sliding out of bed. Somehow his hands are both covered in Iron Man gauntlets (does he sleep in them? Clint wonders.)\nClint scrambles to his feet. \n\u201cKid,\u201d is all he says, but there\u2019s excitement in his voice. \u201cI saw a kid.\u201d\n\u201cWhat am I supposed to say to that? Good for you, I guess,\u201d snaps Tony. He looks slightly demonic, with his messy bed-head and his grey sweatpants and his Spiderman tee-shirt. \u201cNow why . . . exactly . . . are you in my room.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a kid in one of the bedrooms,\u201d says Clint, and understanding rushes into Tony\u2019s eyes. \n\u201cPeter.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m waiting for him to wake up so I can introduce myself\u2014,\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d snarls Tony.\nIt\u2019s aggressive and harsh, and not a noise Clint is used to. He frowns slightly.\n\u201cNo,\u201d says Tony again, and this time he sounds slightly calmer. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to meet him. He\u2019ll be leaving for school in a few minutes, anyway. But you have to stay away from him. Don\u2019t push me on this.\u201d\nJust because Clint hasn\u2019t built a super suit or gotten seven PHD\u2019s or lifted Thor\u2019s hammer doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not smart. And yes, he likes to make lists, but he\u2019s also ridiculously good at figuring things out.\n\u201cIs he your kid?\u201d asks Clint. \n\u201cWhy does everyone automatically assume that he\u2019s mine?\u201d fumes Tony. \u201cGod, I know I\u2019ve had some fun, but\u2014,\u201d\n\u201cOne. You\u2019re weirdly protective of him,\u201d says Clint. \u201cTwo. For some reason, a kid has a bedroom in your tower\u2014,\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not\u2014,\u201d\n\u201cWhen do I get to meet him?\u201d asks Clint defiantly. He raises his chin up to meet Tony\u2019s gaze. \u201cDo you not trust me?\u201d\nTony gets up and begins to pace, shooting irritated looks at Clint every few steps.\n\u201cI have a schedule,\u201d says Tony absently. \u201cFor who gets to meet him, and when. Too many people have already . . . I can\u2019t . . .\u201d\n\u201cWhen?\u201d\n\u201cNot until he\u2019s eighteen,\u201d says Tony firmly. \u201cIt\u2019s not personal, Clint. But everything to do with Peter Parker is strictly on a need-to-know basis.\u201d\nLike hell it\u2019s not personal.\n\u00a0\n---\n\u00a0\nWhich is how Clint finds himself in a black car with tinted windows, watching Tony\u2019s driver drop the kid off at some nerd school.\nClint has been undercover more times than he can count. His therapist, Neil, says that\u2019s why he acts the way he does. With the childish humor and the coping mechanisms and the lists. Neil says that somewhere along the line, Clint must have lost himself in one of the Hydra bases. And now, this . . . person he is, it\u2019s all he has left.\nFuck Neil the therapist.\nClint has infiltrated a hydra base with no less than sixty armed guards. In, out. They never even knew he was there, at least, not until it was too late.\nAnyway, he can infiltrate a high school, no problem.\nHe waits until the bell rings and all the small children scurry to class before he gets out of the car. He pulls his hoodie low over his face and jogs to the doors of the school. Some idiot has left them unlocked, possibly to allow late children the opportunity to get to class. Ha.\nClint has a plan. 1) Find the vents. 2) Find the crawlspace above Peter\u2019s classroom. 3) Observe. 4) Take notes. 5) Figure out whatever Stark is hiding. 6) Use aforementioned information as leverage to infiltrate his way into Starks inner circle. Or possibly as blackmail, Clint isn\u2019t particular.\nThe school is eerily empty, and Clint has no trouble finding a vent outlet. He tugs off his backpack and sets to work getting the panel off the wall.\nEasy, peasy. \nAnd then, from somewhere behind him, a loud slurp echoes through the empty hall.\nBeing undercover is about maintaining one\u2019s cool. So, as soon as he hears the slurp, Clint becomes Nathaniel Clinasha, Vent Repair Man. He\u2019s good at being undercover; really, really good. So he turns around slowly and finds himself face to face with a girl.\nShe\u2019s drinking some sort of Starbucks drink\u2014quite possibly the cause of the slurping noise. Her messy black hair is pulled back into a low bun, and her tee-shirt is cropped with the words Fuck the Patriarchy scrawled across in Sharpee.\n\u201cThe vents are off limits,\u201d says mystery-girl coolly. \u201cFlash got suspended two months ago for releasing a few hamsters into them. I wouldn\u2019t mess around, if I were you.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Clint says. His voice is lower than it usually is, and his body is filled with a euphoric calm that he always gets when he\u2019s undercover. \u201cThe school hired me to take a look at some faulty wiring. Its okay, kid. You can get back to class.\u201d\nThe girl doesn\u2019t look impressed, which is weird. Normally his I\u2019m-not-doing-anything-wrong-voice is quite convincing.\n\u201cThe school hired you,\u201d she repeats. \u201cFor faulty wiring.\u201d\nClint thinks fast. He tries to remember everything about wiring that Tony has ever casually mentioned in conversation.\n\u201cI need to access the building\u2019s mainframe,\u201d he says importantly. \u201cThis is one of the best points of access. What did you say your name was, again?\u201d\nThe girl puts the hand that\u2019s not clenching her drink on her hip. She quirks an eyebrow, and he\u2019s reminded vividly of a younger, non-white version of Natasha.\n\u201cI\u2019d be convinced,\u201d she says coolly. \u201cExcept for the fact that I\u2019m vice president of Robotics, and I\u2019m fairly certain that our school doesn\u2019t have a mainframe, especially not one you can access through the fucking vents.\u201d\nShit.\n\u201cI\u2014,\u201d\n\u201cAlso,\u201d she says coolly. \u201cI have a poster of you on my bedroom wall.\u201d\nDouble shit. Cover blown. Initiate: comical Clint. Goal: diffuse situation.\n\u201cI had no idea you were a fan of Nathaniel Clinasha; vent repair man,\u201d says Clint, smiling in what he hopes is a friendly, please-don\u2019t-blow-this-for-me kind of way.\n\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d says the girl coolly. \u201cI have a picture of the Black Widow, and I\u2019m afraid it will mess up the poster if I cut you out.\u201d\nOuch.\nThe girl sighs and dumps her drink in a nearby trash can. When she returns, she\u2019s taken off her sunglasses and she\u2019s looking thoroughly unimpressed.\n\u201cYou\u2019re here for Peter, aren\u2019t you?\u201d she asks. \u201cGod, now I know how everyone in Harry\u2019s year at Hogwarts felt. Here I am, trying to have a normal sophomore year, and a fucking Avenger is here to open the Chamber of Secrets. Thanks a lot, Potter.\u201d\nClint chooses to ignore her, continuing to jimmy open the vent.\n\u201cWhat exactly is the plan, here?\u201d asks the girl coldly. \u201cAre you just going to parade through our schools ventilation system until you stumble above the right classroom?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to access the schools mainframe,\u201d says Clint through gritted teeth, \u201cAnd then I am going to repair the faulty wiring.\u201d\n\u201cGod, this is painful,\u201d says the girl. \u201cYou\u2019re a loser, you know that? I\u2019m going to go to class, I don\u2019t think I can take the secondhand embarrassment when you inevitably fuck something up.\u201d\n\u201cYou know,\u201d snaps Clint. \u201cI\u2019m actually really good at what I do. Contrary to popular belief, I\u2019ve had a ton of training, and I\u2019d really appreciate being given the benefit of the doubt.\u201d\nThe girl pauses. She moves so that she\u2019s standing beside him, staring at his face. It\u2019s kind of freaking Clint out. \n\u201cOkay,\u201d she says. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll trust whatever credentials you got from . . . from vent repair-person school.\u201d\nClint jerks out a nod.\nThe girl turns away.\n\u201cTake your first left and then keep going straight,\u201d the girl calls over her shoulder. \u201cYou should find Mr. Wallmon\u2019s calc classroom eventually. Not that you\u2019re looking for Peter, or anything like that.\u201d\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d says Clint dully. \u201cBecause I\u2019m a vent repair man.\u201d\n\u201cLooking for the mainframe so you can fix the faulty wiring,\u201d the girl agrees.\nClint pauses for a minute, staring at her. \u201cThanks,\u201d he says finally.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d the girl says. \u201cYou know, people do take you seriously. Just because you\u2019re kind of childish on your Instagram, and because of all that bad PR you got from jogging through central park sans clothing\u2014,\u201d\n\u201cA dare,\u201d Clint says firmly. \u201cBut go on.\u201d\nThe girl rolls her eyes. \u201cIn the fifth Harry Potter book, everyone always gets on his case for being a dick, you know? But PTSD does weird things to people. You don\u2019t have to apologize for your weird coping mechanisms, and you sure as hell don\u2019t have to prove anything.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m a vent repair man,\u201d says Clint again. \u201cI mean, sure, there were a few times when I got stuck in bad situa\u2014I mean, when I got stuck in vents. But it\u2019s not enough to get PTSD over. I don\u2019t have PTSD.\u201d\nThe girl tilts her head to the side. \u201cYou\u2019re a loser,\u201d she says instead of answering, but there\u2019s no bite behind it.\nClint doesn\u2019t quite know how to respond to that.\n\u201cTurn left and keep going,\u201d he finally says, trying to remember her instructions from earlier.\n\u201cMr. Wallmon has a really nasally voice,\u201d says the girl. \u201cYou\u2019ll know it when you hear it.\u201d\n\u201cThanks.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be able to return the favor someday,\u201d says the girl flippantly. \u201cJust remember, you owe me. I\u2019m trying to make sure as many Avengers as possible are indebted to me. I\u2019m up to two.\u201d\nBy the time Clint shimmies his way into the vent, the girl is gone.\n\u00a0\n---\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s hard to see Peter through the vent. The slits are angled down, so Clint is virtually invisible, but it also makes it kind of hard to see through them.\nHere\u2019s what he does observe:\n1) Peter is smart. Like, really smart. Smart enough to be Tony\u2019s kid. He\u2019s finished the eight pages of calc in the time that it takes Clint to find his classroom.\n2) He\u2019s a smartass. Clint\u2019s high tech hearing aids can pick up all the little barbs he mumbles to the Asian kid beside him, even if no one else can hear. See again: possible offspring of Tony.\n3) He seems to know that someone is watching him.\nThe girl from the hall, the one with the fuck the patriarchy tee shirt throws a middle finger at the vents as she enters the room ten minutes later.\nPeter follows her gaze, frowning suspiciously up at the vent. Clint isn\u2019t concerned; he\u2019s virtually invisible from Peter\u2019s angle. He has plenty of time to observe and wait.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up, dude?\u201d asks the chubby Asian kid from beside Peter.\n\u201cI think I hear someone breathing,\u201d mutters Peter, so softly that Clint almost misses it. \n\u201cYeah,\u201d says the Asian kid. \u201cPeople sometimes do that.\u201d\nPeter frowns suspiciously up at the vent. Clint puts his hand over his mouth and tries to stop breathing. It\u2019s harder than he expected. He decides he needs oxygen more than he needs to be quiet.\nThe hallway girl slides into the seat next to Peter. Peter and the Asian kid exchange a baffled look, but don\u2019t say anything.\n\u201cI\u2019m sitting here today,\u201d says hallway girl. \u201cThis is going to get a lot more interesting than multiplying matrices.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s interesting?\u201d asks Peter\u2019s friend.\nThe hallway girl shrugs and pulls out a sketchbook.\n\u201cIs something up, MJ?\u201d Peter hisses to her. Clint feels a stab of disappointment that her name isn\u2019t actually hallway girl.\nMJ shrugs again.\nPeter glances up at the vents, looking vaguely alarmed.\n\u201cNothing you need to worry about,\u201d says MJ coolly. \u201cThe usual. Stalkers and maintenance workers, the whole nine yards, really. Hey,\u201d she says, and her eyes casually drift upwards. Peter follows her line of sight. \u201cI think the school is having a bit of a problem with infestations in the vents. Pity no one in this classroom has the ability to check it out, make sure we\u2019re all safe.\u201d\nPeter\u2019s whole body goes rigid.\n\u201cMake an excuse for me,\u201d he mutters to MJ, side eyeing the teacher.\n\u201cCongratulations,\u201d MJ deadpans. \u201cYou\u2019ve officially been diagnosed with the bird flu. Go ahead, I\u2019ll let Mr. Wallmon know.\u201d\nPeter looks at the Asian kid a little desperately. \u201cKeep her from telling the class I have bird flu, okay?\u201d he says, and then he\u2019s crouched over and sneaking out the cracked door.\nKids today , thinks Hawkeye. If hallway girl has outed him, he\u2019s going to be pissed. The last thing he needs is for Iron Man to show up at the school to bail his secret kid out. \nAnd for a few minutes, life is good. Clint watches the girl begin to sketch a drawing of someone who looks suspitiously like him. He listens to the teacher try and explain some obscure calculous topic. He waits for Peter to return from wherever he's disappeared to with his backpack.\nThen the vents creak from somewhere in front of him. Clint freezes.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you know it\u2019s dangerous to spy on Stark Industries Interns?\u201d comes an unnaturally raspy voice from somewhere in the crawlspace in front of him.\nClint raises his eyes from the vent slowly.\nDamn it. Of course. Of course this fucking kid called in Spiderman as backup. Because why would the universe want a simple in and out opp to be easy.\nJesus. \n\u201cDon\u2019t you know it\u2019s dangerous to go sneaking around vents if you\u2019re not a certified vent repair man?\u201d whispers Clint back.\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Spiderman rasps.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your voice?\u201d\n\u201cKaren, cut interrogation mode,\u201d Spiderman hisses. \u201cLook, man, I don\u2019t want to have to get Mr. Stark involved.\u201d\n\u201cYou sound familiar,\u201d Clint says suspiciously. The vent wavers suspiciously underneath him, and he realizes suddenly that the crawlspace was not meant to support two fully-grown men.\nSpiderman, however, seems a bit slow on the uptake.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be here,\u201d he says. \u201cJust . . . you have to go, okay?\u201d\n\u201cWe both have to go,\u201d says Clint, trying to scoot backwards. \u201cWe have to get out of here, like, yesterday, how much do you weigh?\u201d\nThe eyes of the Spiderman suit widen angrily. \u201cYou can\u2019t just ask people how much they weigh.\u201d\n\u201cI can if I\u2019m trapped in structurally unsound\u2014,\u201d\n\nCreak.\n\nAnd suddenly the ceiling is falling.\nYears of training kick immediately. Clint reaches out to try and grab Spiderman; perhaps to drag him out of harm\u2019s way. But Spiderman is stuck to what\u2019s left of the ceiling, and falling fast. Clint reaches out and looses his balance, too, and suddenly they\u2019re on the floor of the classroom, looking up past twenty confused faces into a hole in the ceiling.\n\u201cUm,\u201d says Clint. Spiderman groans and brushes some ceiling debris off of his hands. \nThe teacher is hyperventilating, staring at him with wide eyes. The Asian Kid is trying to hide his laughter behind his hands. \nMJ is the only one who looks unbothered. She brushes some ceiling debris off her desk and goes back to drawing in her sketch book.\n\u201cHey, Nathaniel,\u201d she says.\n\u201cUm, yes,\u201d says Clint. \u201cI am the ceiling inspector. We have received reports that the ceiling was structurally unsound\u2014,\u201d\n\u201cHoly shit, is that Hawkeye?\u201d asks some douchey kid with slicked back hair and a Nirvana tee-shirt. \u201cWait, that\u2019s Spiderman. You totally carjacked me!\u201d \nSpiderman winces.\n\u201cI\u2019m . . . um . . . helping the ceiling inspector,\u201d he says haltingly. Clint makes a point to ask Nat to give him a hand with his lying, because it\u2019s pretty terrible. \n\u201cThe ceiling was fine,\u201d says the teacher faintly. \u201cI mean, until you two crashed through it.\u201d\nClint points at it, eyes wide.\n\u201cWater damage,\u201d he says firmly. \u201cTony Stark will be paying for that.\u201d\n\u201cTony Stark will never find out about this,\u201d says Spiderman firmly, getting to his feet. His voice is once again low and raspy.\nAnd then, suddenly, Clint understands.\nOh.\nOh.\n\u00a0\n(Later, when Natasha asks how he met Peter, he tells her she doesn\u2019t want to know. Plausable deniability, and all that.)\nTony really shouldn\u2019t leave the room\u2014it\u2019s the first time all of the Avengers have been together since the split. It\u2019s definitely not a happy reunion\u2014the underlying tension in their conference room is enough to make him want to get a drink, regardless of his status as a recovering alcoholic.\nHell, this meeting is such a big deal even Thor and Bruce decided to make a guest star appearance. Sure, that was completely coincidental, and there\u2019s a hole in Tony\u2019s backyard with an Asgaurdian crest burned into the ground. But their presence is probably the only thing keeping Tony from trying to beat Roger\u2019s head in, so. \nAnyway, the meeting is super important. It involves the signing of the modified accords, the abolishment of the \u201cwar criminal\u201d status, and residency treaties\u2014which pretty much means they\u2019re moving back into the compound, but whatever. Tony has a mansion upstate, it\u2019s not like it matters that he\u2019s officially a landlord again.\n\u201cWe should talk about Barns,\u201d Natasha says, her voice cutting through the cold silence of the room.\nBruce shifts slightly, well aware that the tension in the room has gone up about thirty percent. The only sound is the scratching of pens on paper.\n\u201cDo I even want to know-,\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll fill you in later,\u201d Tony says abruptly. He ignores Natasha and makes eye contact with Rogers. It takes every ounce of control in his body not to spew an avalanche of quipping insults. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d\nRogers doesn\u2019t break eye contact. \u201cSafe,\u201d he says smoothly, in that aggravating I-know-best tone.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d snarls Tony. \u201cIs trust not a too-way street?\u201d\n\u201cYou should not let petty squabbles get in the way of brotherhood,\u201d Thor says wisely. \u201cIn the past year, Loki and I have gotten closer than I would\u2019ve thought possible. True, he tried to sell me to this creepy old man who I\u2019m fairly certain he was having intimate relations with, but I stuck a Taser on his back and now we\u2019re stronger than ever.\u201d\nTony raises a finger. \u201cBelieve me, we are going to come back to that story, but we have pressing-,\u201d\nThat\u2019s when his watch buzzes and flashes red and blue, the colors he reserves solely for Peter Parker. And shit, if that isn\u2019t enough to make his blood pressure go through the roof.\nHe stands up so fast his chair is knocked over. \u201cI have to go. Rhodey, can you handle this?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Rogers says. He stands up too. \u201cReally, Tony? Is now the time-,\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s urgent,\u201d Tony says, and in half a second the nanotech is spreading over his body, coating him with a layer of red metal. He rushes towards the window, which Friday swings open for him manually.\nRhodes reaches out and grabs his arm. Tony glances back\u2014everyone in the room is staring at him, completely nonplussed. Natasha has two guns out, as if she expects him to declare that the Battle of New York is resuming.\n\u201cTony,\u201d Rhodes hisses. \u201cThis is bad, even for you. You can\u2019t just leave us here\u2014,\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s my kid,\u201d he fumbles, the \u2018my\u2019 slipping out before he can stop it. Raw panic is engraved in every word, because they\u2019re wasting precious time. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong, I . . . I have to get to the city now.\u201d\n\u201cPeter?\u201d asks Natasha, standing up quickly. Wanda stands too, biting her lip, her fingers glowing red. \nRhodey lets go of his arm, and Tony can see the panic in his own eyes reflected in Rodey\u2019s face. He\u2019s knows Peter, has even hung out with them sometimes on days when Peter\u2019s come over after school to work with Tony in the lab. Rhodey likes Peter.\nTony doubts you can meet Peter and not love him instantly, but maybe he\u2019s biased.\n\u201cDo you need us to go?\u201d\n\u201cStay,\u201d says Tony firmly, already halfway out the window. \u201cI\u2019ve got this.\u201d\nIt takes approximately ten minutes for him to fly at top speed from upstate to the city, and while he does he pulls up Peter\u2019s vitals. \nHe monitors them through a watch on Peter\u2019s wrist. He\u2019s not entirely sure if Peter knows just how much the watch keeps tabs on him, but Peter\u2019s smart enough to know that Tony didn\u2019t just give it to him for the aesthetic appeal.\nAs far as Tony can tell, nothing\u2019s wrong. There\u2019s no elevated heart rate or high blood pressure; Peter hasn\u2019t even been in the suit for three days. Peter isn\u2019t picking up his phone, but it\u2019s a shitty, cracked cheap Android that\u2019s about four years old. \nTony wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the phone committed suicide because it was so sad about its terrible quality.\n\u201cOk, Friday,\u201d Tony says, just a little irritated. \u201cIf there\u2019s nothing wrong with him, why did you give me a code Spandex?\u201d\n\u201cPeter\u2019s blood alcohol content is currently at .8,\u201d Friday says mildly.\nTony stops, actually stops in midair, hovering over some part of upstate New York, and lets a feeling of absolute horror wash over him.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he says.\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t as drastic as it sounds,\u201d Friday says. \u201cWith his enhanced metabolism, the substance should be out of his system within the next few hours. But I thought it best to inform you . . .\u201d\n\u201cCall May,\u201d Tony says through gritted teeth, resuming his flight towards Queens.\n\u201cCalling May Parker.\u201d\nTony hasn\u2019t fully decided what to say by the time the line clicks and May Parker answers with a concerned, \u201cHello?\u201d\n\u201cMay,\u201d Tony says, smiling the panic away even though she can\u2019t see him. \u201cHow are you on this lovely night? Listen, I want to talk to Peter about some suit upgrades, but he doesn\u2019t seem to be answering his phone. Can you put him on?\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d May says, and gives a little laugh. \u201cNo, I can\u2019t, actually. I dropped him and Ned off at another party in the suburbs about an hour ago. I can take a message, if you want.\u201d\nTony digests that little piece of trivia for a second, and then decides to pry.\n\u201cA suburb party?\u201d Tony says casually. \u201cHey, I remember those. Aren\u2019t you worried about the underage drinking?\u201d\nHe knows he\u2019s being blunt, but May just laughs.\n\u201cThis is Peter we\u2019re talking about,\u201d she says. \u201cBesides, he knows how I feel. I\u2019m fine with him experimenting, or whatever; I mean, kids do it whether or not their parents approve. I just want him to be in the house while he\u2019s messing around, you know?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d says Tony, his throat tight.\n\u201cBoss,\u201d Friday says urgently in his ear. \u201cPeter\u2019s pulse has dramatically increased by over 200 beats per minute. He has left the party and is currently heading down Westmark Street.\u201d\nShit, Tony thinks. He should let May handle this, it\u2019s not his place. He should let her know that Peter has a ridiculously high BAC, turn around, and fly back to the Tower so he can breathe down Rogers\u2019 neck until he gets his John Hancock. It\u2019s the right thing to do.\n\u201cHey, do you mind if I pick Peter up?\u201d he asks, because he\u2019s never been good at removing himself from situations he should have no part in. \u201cI really need to go over some of these upgrades with him. He can stay at the compound overnight, I don\u2019t care.\u201d\nMay pauses for a second, thinking it over.\n\u201cHe\u2019d like that,\u201d she says finally. \u201cAnd it works out nicely. I have a night shift at the hospital, Ms. Leeds was intending to drive him home.\u201d\n\u201cPerfect,\u201d says Tony. \u201cThank you, Ms. Parker.\u201d\n\u201cMay,\u201d she says firmly. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow, then? When you drop him off.\u201d\n\u201cSee you then.\u201d\nFriday ends the call without being prompted, and pulls up Peter\u2019s location again. He\u2019s stopped moving, now firmly centered in a park on the Upper West Side. Tony has Friday text Happy to meet him at the park with a car.\nAren\u2019t you supposed to be in some meeting right now? Happy texts back.\nTony doesn\u2019t reply.\n\nPepper\u2019s going to be pissed. Happy writes a second later.\nIt's Peter, Tony writes.\nHe gets three letters back. Omw.\n\n\nTony lands in a clearing at the edge of the park and exits the suit. The nanotech recedes back into his chest, and he whips on a pair of sunglasses and puts on what he hopes is an authoritative grimace.\n\n\n\nHe finds Peter on the swings. Anger hits Tony like a whip, red and hot.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis time, on Peter screws the pooch . . .\u201d\n\n\n\n\nIt would be almost funny, if it weren\u2019t so pathetic. Peter whips around and almost falls off the swing, his hands whipping out at the last possible second to grab the chains.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMisser S\u2019ark!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHey, Pete,\u201d says Tony, sliding down on the swing to the right of Peter. \u201cHow\u2019s it going? It\u2019s a fantastic night to get totally wasted, I\u2019ll give you that.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nPeter wavers slightly, staring fixedly at a spot a good six inches to the left of Tony\u2019s face.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cScience,\u201d he says helpfully.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d says Tony. He\u2019s pissed and he\u2019s got all the time in the world, and like hell he\u2019s going to let Peter get off easily.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cScience,\u201d Peter repeats. He sways slightly. \u201cWanted to see if I could. Drunk. Drink. I can.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d Tony says, holding up a hand. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, pause. Are you actually trying to tell me that you somehow got your BAC up to .8 for a goddamn science experiment?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nPeter shrugs.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d says Tony, rubbing his hand over his eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t deal with this, Parker. I can\u2019t deal with a drunk teenager. I lied to your Aunt for you, I figured you were having some . . . some mid-childhood crisis and were in need of a supportive\u2014,\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cFlat earth!\u201d\n\n\n\n\nTony breaks off and stares at him, not sure whether to laugh or fly into a towering rage.\n\n\n\n\nPeter hesitates at Tony\u2019s expression. \u201cFlat earth,\u201d he repeats, his voice significantly smaller. \u201cFlat earthers . . . they\u2019re fat shaming the earth. Isssnot right, Mr. S\u2019ark.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nTony sits in stony silence for a full thirty seconds before he officially gives up.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAlright,\u201d he says through gritted teeth. \u201cI\u2019ve had enough. Let\u2019s get you back to the\u2014,\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTony?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nTony is on his feet in an instant, a gauntlet spread over his hand. He can\u2019t see very well, not out into the darkened playground, but that better not be who he thinks it is. \n\n\n\n\nBecause if it is . . . \n\n\n\n\nOf course it is. Steve emerges from the shadows, arms held up in surrender, eyeing Peter with an intrigued curiosity.\n\n\n\n\nThe muscles in Tony\u2019s hand flex subconsciously, and the gauntlet goes off. The blast hits Steve squarely in the chest. Not hard enough to make him fall, but it gives him the message. Stay where you are.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou followed me?\u201d snarls Tony.\n\n\n\n\nSteve raises his hands in surrender. He doesn\u2019t try to come any closer, but his eyes do drift over to Peter.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEyes on me, Rogers,\u201d says Tony, malice laced through every syllable. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Tony,\u201d says Rogers. His blue eyes are wide, and unnecessarily sincere. \u201cI thought you might need backup. You seemed so freaked out. I only wanted to make sure you were okay.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019d wanted backup, I would\u2019ve asked Rhodey to come with me,\u201d hisses Tony. \u201cOr Natasha. Hell, Clint Barton would probably be above you on the list, and he annoys the shit out of me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMisser S\u2019ark!\u201d says Peter excitedly, a little slow on the uptake. \u201cMisser S\u2019ark, tha\u2019s Captain America.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nSteve\u2019s eyes widen slightly.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s drunk,\u201d says Tony coldly. \u201cAnd before you get all 'alcohol is the seventh sin' on me, I'm going to remind you that you're still technically a war criminal and therefore your opinion is invalid.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cFlat earth,\u201d says Peter distantly. \u201cScience.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm not judging him. Or you,\" adds Rogers quickly. \"I'm a little taken aback, Tony, but I'll be the first to admit-,\"\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou know what, this is actually a pretty good punishment,\u201d says Tony. \u201cFirst time he drinks, Captain America shows up to smite him for his poor judgement. I dig it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s already tol\u2019 me that drugs and alcohol are anti-American,\u201d slurs Peter.\n\n\n\n\nTony stiffens slightly, but Rogers looks just as baffled as Tony feels.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d says Tony, his voice tight. \u201cHave you two met before? And I want you to think very, very hard before you answer, Rogers, because this is my kid and if I find out you\u2019ve been corrupting him in secret. . .\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTony, I swear,\u201d says Steve earnestly. \u201cI only came tonight because I thought you might be in trouble. I would never\u2014,\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSo. The peer pressure is gettin\u2019 to you,\u201d mumbles Peter.\n\n\n\n\nSteve freezes.\n\n\n\n\nTony glances back and forth between them, his eyebrows raised. His hands are clenched into fists at his sides, and he\u2019s shaking slightly.\n\n\n\n\nWanda? Fine. Natasha? Alright, Tony couldn\u2019t have hidden Peter from her if he\u2019d tried. Clint was a bit of a wild card, but Tony can swallow that bitter taste because Clint is a good agent. But the idea of Steve meeting Peter without Tony\u2019s consent? Tony\u2019s not sure he can deal with that.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cExplain,\u201d he says, his voice tight.\n\n\n\n\nPeter seems to know how angry he is, and backtracks immediately. \u201cIt\u2019s a . . . a PSA. They show them in school all the time. For detention an\u2019 drinking an\u2019 . . . an\u2019 sex-ed and stuff.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s almost comical, how miserable Steve looks.\n\n\n\n\nLuckily for him, Happy pulls up at that exact moment. Tony points a firm finger at him, says, \u201cThis is not over, Rogers. Believe me, we will be revisiting this,\u201d and pours Peter into the car.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr. Stark,\u201d says Peter, half an hour later, as the car pulls up to the tower. He\u2019s metabolized the alcohol, for the most part, and he\u2019ll be fine as soon as he sleeps it off.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cKid, I will legitimately buy you any kind of alcohol you want if you tell me more about those PSAs.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTony!\u201d says Happy sharply, but Tony doesn\u2019t care. He\u2019s joking; of course he is. And after Peter sleeps it off, they\u2019re going to be having a long talk about what qualifies as a science experiment. \n\n\n\n\nBut for now?\n\n\n\n\n\u201cFriday, tell everyone to meet me in the home theater after I tuck spider-baby into bed,\u201d says Tony, unable to keep the glee out of his voice. \u201cI\u2019ve found some videos I think they might enjoy.\u201d\n\n\nThere\u2019s this rumor going around that drowning is peaceful.\nAllegedly, after your lungs fill up with water and you surrender control, it\u2019s actually a pretty easy way to go. Not pleasant, by any means, but nothing terribly traumatic either.\nTony can confirm (0/10, would not recommend) that the aforementioned rumor is complete and absolute bullshit.\nHe doesn\u2019t really like to think about the terrorist cell in Afghanistan. While ranking all the things in life that have fucked him up (starting with the wormhole and including Howard, Rhodey falling out of the sky, Sokovia, and pretty much every other major life event since birth) being water boarded definantly is in the top five Most Traumatic Things.\nHe can still remember the feeling of helplessness. The hands behind his neck, forcing his head down into the basin of water. They weren\u2019t interrogating him. They just wanted him to know that they had complete and total control.\nMaybe it wasn\u2019t pleasant for him because his lungs never really \u201cfilled\u201d with water. Because when the water was Tony\u2019s reality, in his lungs and eyes and ears, they would pull him out, and he would briefly remember what it felt like to be able to breath.\nHe\u2019d be perfectly happy to never have to experience that feeling again. Unfortunately, luck has never been on his side.\nHis day starts out normal. He wakes up next to Pepper. Makes breakfast for her in his Spiderman tee-shirt. Showers. \n\u201cYou have two meetings today, one with shareholders and the other with Ross,\u201d Pepper informs him, giving him a peck on her way out. \u201cIf you miss either of them, I will personally see to it that you are castrated.\u201d\nTony hands her toast and promises to be a good boy.\nHe never shows up to either meeting.\nIt\u2019s about ten when he gets the alert that Peter is in the suit. The alert pops up suddenly on all the screens in Tony\u2019s lab simultaneously, made urgent by the fact that Peter\u2019s vitals are off the charts. His blood pressure is insanely high, and Tony is concerned if his heart rate gets any higher he\u2019ll have a heart attack.\nImmediately, he grabs the nearest helmet to him and pulls it over his head. He opens his mouth, ready to demand that Friday call Peter, but he never gets the chance.\nPeter calls him first.\nIt says a lot about Friday that she doesn\u2019t even have to ask before she puts him through. Friday\u2019s scan lets Tony know that Peter\u2019s on the roof of his school.\n\u201cIt went through,\u201d Peter chokes out. There are tears streaked down his face, and he\u2019s practically hyperventilating. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was going to.\u201d\n\u201cPete?\u201d Tony says, and he can\u2019t keep the panic out of his voice. \n\u201cI had to sneak out of the window of math class to get here. I\u2019m pretty sure some kids saw me climb up the wall with my backpack, but\u2014,\u201d\n\u201cFill me in,\u201d says Tony. There\u2019s a pain in his chest that feels suspiciously like his heart repeatedly throwing itself against his rib cage.\n\u201cShots,\u201d Peter chokes out. \u201cFour so far. Someone has a gun, Tony.\u201d\nIt would be funny, if it weren\u2019t so terrifying. Tony doesn\u2019t quite comprehend any of it, but the word \u2018Tony\u2019 resonates in a way that nothing else does. He\u2019s suit is around him before he can quite comprehend what\u2019s happening, and he\u2019s crashed out of the skylight before Friday has time to open it.\n\u201cGun,\u201d Tony says distantly. \u201cBut . . . but aren\u2019t you at . . .\u201d\nThe word \u2018school\u2019 dies on his tongue.\nAnd then he\u2019s drowning again, and the water is everywhere. It\u2019s streaming down his face before he can stop it, the blind panic giving way to a cool, dull sense of shock. The water hits his mouth, and he realizes distantly that it\u2019s salty.\n\u201c\u2014signal blockers,\u201d he can hear Peter saying distantly. \u201cWifi went down first, then the cell service . . . no one can make calls from inside. Tony, can you\u2014,\u201d\nFriday is on it before Tony has time to blink. She\u2019s notified everyone from the police to the FBI to the CIA to what\u2019s left of Shield before Tony\u2019s even had time to register what she\u2019s doing.\n\u201cAlright, Pete,\u201d says Tony distantly, but it\u2019s as though he\u2019s still under water. \u201cYou\u2019ve done fantastic, alright? Sit tight, I\u2019m on my way. I\u2019m about twenty-five minutes out still, goddamn it, Friday, can\u2019t this thing go any faster?\u201d\n\u201cMr. Stark.\u201d\n\u201cBut whatever you do, do not go back in that building. Peter, I swear to god\u2014,\u201d\n\u201cMr. Stark.\u201d\n\u201c\u2014if you go back in that building I will make sure you\u2014,\u201d\n\u201cMr. Stark.\u201d\n\u201cWhat.\u201d\nPeter is crying again. \u201cYou have to tell May that I love her. Please.\u201d\nOne of the things they don\u2019t tell you about drowning is how hard it is to hear. When underwater, the only reality is the burning in the chest and eyes.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Tony fumbles. \u201cPete\u2014,\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve handled worse than a kid with a gun,\u201d Peter says. \u201cMr. Stark, Ned is down there. MJ. Hell, even Flash is somewhere in this building and none of them have Spiderman. I do.\u201d\nTony tries to tell Peter to stop being stupid, but the only noise that comes out of his mouth is a sort of choked gagging.\n\u201cBut in case I\u2014,\u201d Peter breaks off. \u201cPromise you\u2019ll tell May.\u201d\n\u201cPeter\u2014,\u201d\n\u201cPromise.\u201d\n\u201cI swear to god, if you go back in side that building\u2014,\u201d\n\u201cTony. Please.\u201d\nTony wishes that he could give in and let the water take him. That his lungs would fill up and he\u2019d just have peaceful nothingness. \nBut he can\u2019t afford that. Not now.\n\u201cI promise.\u201d\nSpiderman swings himself over the edge of the roof and crawls back through the window. Tony can here the gasps of surprise, and then the line goes dead.\n\u201cFriday,\u201d says Tony. For some reason, his voice sounds different. He can\u2019t put his finger on it. \u201cGet me everything you can on those signal blockers. Get me everything you can on the shooter, too. I want you to hack feeds, go into school security records, whatever it takes.\u201d\n\u201cOn it, boss.\u201d\n\u201cAnd pull up the Avengers\u2019 group chat.\u201d\nThe chat hasn\u2019t been used since 2016. On July 8th, Clint texted in a bunch of pictures of a cat with a cheeseburger, and Nat got into a hot chocolate vs coffee debate with Rhodes. On July 9th, Rhodey texted Ross is here. Briefing room. Now. \nOn July 10th, 2016, Tony texted Anyone seen our American Idol lying around?\nNo one has texted anything since. Tony shoves down his displeasure about being reduced to double-texting and hits send.\n[sent 10:21 am] Anyone in the city: Midtown high is having a school shooting. \n[sent 10:21 am] It\u2019s Peter\u2019s school. Please hurry. I\u2019m still 20 minutes out.\nNo one responds. Tony hopes that means they\u2019re all busy getting on it.\nTony must black out for a little after that, because the next thing he knows he\u2019s at the school.\nIt reminds him eerily of a war zone. Cops and bucars have surrounded the school. There are ambulances regularly stationed, and SWAT teams are bringing out pools of students. \nThere\u2019s also a fucking media team filming the whole thing, which would make Tony fucking livid if his brain could form any thought but Peter.\nSteve is waiting for him in the center of the courtyard. The cops, media, and students hurrying from one place to another steer clear of him.\nTony lands in front of him.\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you in there?\u201d\nIt\u2019s as if all the tension and hostility that\u2019s been buried under the surface reaches a breaking point. Distantly, Tony registers the various media focusing their cameras on him and Steve, but he\u2019s too pissed to give a fuck. \nSteve doesn\u2019t move.\n\u201cGet out of the way, Rogers.\u201d\nIt\u2019s the most dangerous he\u2019s ever sounded. The metal around his face amplifies the harshness of the words, and Steve looks away.\n\u201cWe both know I can\u2019t do that, Tony.\u201d\n\u201cMy fucking kid is in there!\u201d Tony yells.\n\u201cIf you go in there, guns blazing, blinded by rage and fear, people are going to get hurt,\u201d says Steve. His voice is deadly calm. \u201cNat will be able to shut this down before it starts. Clint says he knows this school\u2019s ventilation system like the back of his hand. They\u2019re both already inside. Stand down, Tony.\u201d\n\u201cYou lost the authority to give me orders when you left me to die,\u201d Tony snarls, and his voice breaks. \u201cRight, I\u2019ve had enough of this.\u201d\nHe raises his gauntlet, ready to blast Steve into a pile of red and blue sprinkles. Rockets pop out of the plates in his shoulders.\nSteve doesn\u2019t move. His expression doesn\u2019t shift, but a tear traces its way down his face.\nIt\u2019s enough to make Tony hesitate. Because this is a man who grew up during the pinnacle of toxic masculinity. This is the man who watched his friends die in an open war zone, who learned to shut down and hide any and all insecurity, because Captains can\u2019t afford to show weakness.\n\u201cTony,\u201d says Steve. \u201cMen like you and me leave collateral damage wherever we go. This is a school; there are kids still in there. Kids just as innocent as Peter. Hell, as . . . deranged as the shooter is, he\u2019s probably a kid, too. You and me cannot afford to go in there.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a moment of stillness around the courtyard, when everything and everyone fall silent. Yeah, there\u2019s still the hustle of extraction teams bringing out pools of students. But the parametics, and the media with their cameras, and students who are already out fall silent, watching Steve and Tony.\n\u201cHe\u2019s . . .\u201d Tony breaths heavily, but Friday puts the rocket launchers back in his suit without prompting. \u201cHe\u2019s my kid, Rogers. He\u2019s the future of my company and the future of the Avengers, but even more then that . . . he\u2019s my kid. I can\u2019t . . . I can\u2019t just . . .\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d says Steve.\nAnd suddenly Tony is stumbling forward, out of the suit, and Steve is there to catch him. Tony\u2019s not entirely sure who\u2019s wrapping their arms around who, but his head is on Steve\u2019s chest and Steve\u2019s heart is beating wildly and . . . \n. . . and Tony lets the water take him.\n\u201cFound the shooter,\u201d Natasha\u2019s voice echoes through Steve\u2019s earpiece.\nTony only hears because he\u2019s pressed so tightly into Steve\u2019s chest, and at once he snatches the comm out of Steve\u2019s right ear.\n\u201cPeter,\u201d he gasps into the comm. \u201cIs he there?\u201d\n\u201cThe shooter is webbed up,\u201d Clint says, and Tony can hear him giving orders to the cops on the other end of the line. In a second, he\u2019s back on. \u201cNo sign of Peter. But . . .\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Tony demands harshly. He makes a move towards the doors, and Steve puts a hand on his chest. Clint doesn\u2019t respond. \u201cNat, tell me what\u2019s going on in there.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of blood,\u201d Nat\u2019s voice says, almost apathetically. But there\u2019s a waver in it that Tony has never heard before. \u201cIt\u2019s not the shooters.\u201d\nTony loses an additional bit of sanity he didn\u2019t know he still had.\nThe front doors of the school open, and a paramedic comes out.\nTony doesn\u2019t even completely register the blue and red body the medic is half carrying before he\u2019s running. The paramedic has one hand around Peter\u2019s waist, supporting him, and the other is pressing a blood stained cloth to the wound in Peter\u2019s side.\nPeter is pressing an oxygen mask to his face.\nHis bare face.\nHis maskless, tear-strained, barely-able-to-breath, maskless, maskless, maskless face.\nMaskless.\nTony has an Iron Man helmet draped over Peter\u2019s head and hand as soon as he reaches him, but it\u2019s too late. The damage is done. Tony can see the knowledge, the identity reflected in the face of Peter\u2019s classmates. \nThe kid who Tony distantly reconizes as the little shit who bullies Peter is white. His lips move, but he doesn't seem to be able to produce sound. Teachers and classmates alike stare in bemused disbelief. A shiver runs through the police and medics. An (admittedly small) number of reporters have the fucking human decency to lower their cameras.\nFor the first time, Tony registers just how many live-streams have been trained on him since his arrival.\nFuck. Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fu\u2014\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Peter whispers, and suddenly his arms are wrapped around Tony\u2019s neck. Tony shudders slightly, automatically taking the blood stained cloth from the medic and pressing it into Peter\u2019s side. Peter hisses slightly, but doesn\u2019t protest.\n\u201cDon\u2019t apologize,\u201d Tony says automatically.\n\u201cThe mask,\u201d Peter says, his voice hollow. \u201cI took it off to . . . to try and reason with him, show my humanity, y\u2019know. And then I got shot and I guess I forgot and . . . and I\u2019ve really fucked up this time, haven\u2019t I?\u201d\nTony doesn\u2019t have time to respond, because a first responder rushes forward to try and take Peter away from him. Tony doesn\u2019t\u2019 have to shove him aside, though, because Steve is there, pushing everyone away from them.\nTony has never been more appreciative in his entire life.\n\u201cHe needs treatment,\u201d Tony hears a medic say.\n\u201cWe treat our own,\u201d says Nat\u2019s voice from somewhere behind him, and he realizes suddenly that she and Clint are flanking him.\n\u201cTeam unity doesn\u2019t pull out bullets!\u201d the medic says.\n\u201cAnd hopes and prayers don\u2019t stop them,\u201d snaps Tony, hoping the camera catches it because it\u2019s an admittedly badass line. \u201cBut you know who does pull out bullets? Bruce Banner. And he\u2019s the only doctor who\u2019s I'm letting go near my kid, so fuck off.\u201d \nPeter\u2019s body shudders slightly as he leans into Tony. The bullet wound in his side is bleeding steadily, but it doesn\u2019t appear to be life threatening.\nRhodey is pulling into the parking lot when they get there.\n Wanda hops out of the black military van. Her eyes well with tears as she runs to Peter. She gently takes him from Tony, red tendrils of magic swirling around them as she helps him into the car.\n\u201cNed and MJ?\u201d she asks him tenderly, her face carefully blank.\n\u201cThey\u2019re both okay, they had Econ in one of the portables,\u201d Peter says, his voice shaking. \u201cSome shots went off, some people were injured and stuff, but as far as I can tell there aren\u2019t going to be any casualties. I hope.\u201d \n\u201cThanks for the ride,\u201d says Tony, his voice dull, as he slides in next to Peter.\nRhodey\u2019s face is blank. \u201cWe were in the neighborhood,\u201d he deadpans. \u201cSorry we didn\u2019t get here sooner.\u201d\nClint trades seats with Tony so he can lean over Peter and start emergency field surgery; Tony\u2019s hands are shaking too much to play chopsticks, let alone hold open his kid\u2019s bullet wound so it doesn\u2019t close up before Bruce operates.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t try to pull it out with your aunt\u2019s eyebrow tweezers again, did you?\u201d asks Rhodey.\nPeter lets out a shaky laugh. \u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cI learned my lesson.\u201d\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll count today as a win,\u201d says Rhodey.\nTony has thirty-six texts from Pepper. He only responds once.\n\nCall a press conference.\n\n\u201cIt will be tough to clean this up,\u201d Nat says, reading the text over his shoulder.\nPeter\u2019s eyes flutter closed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Tony says, but his words sound hollow even to his own ears. \u201cIt was bound to get out eventually.\u201d\n\u201cWe can get ahead of it,\u201d Steve says firmly. \u201cHis life doesn\u2019t have to change too much. Maybe a security detail for him and his aunt\u2014,\u201d\n\u201cThey should move into the tower\u2014,\u201d\n\u201cPeter, it\u2019s going to be okay\u2014,\u201d\n\u201cI just texted May, she\u2019s freaking out but she\u2019ll be fine, she\u2019s going to meet us at the compound\u2014,\u201d\n\u201cYou did beautifully today, kiddo. I\u2019m almost as proud as I am pissed\u2014,\u201d\n\u201cGuys?\u201d says Peter lamely, shifting slightly as Clint\u2019s practiced hands dig into his skin. \u201cStop. Please.\u201d\nIt\u2019s almost funny, how quiet the car gets instantly.\n\u201cI know it\u2019s going to be okay,\u201d Peter says, and his voice cracks slightly. Prepubescent strain, Tony wants to joke, but now doesn\u2019t seem like the time. \u201cI mean, obviously things are going to change.\u201d\n\u201cObviously,\u201d Wanda says, a slight smirk on her face. She raises her left hand and they touch pinkies. Damn inside jokes, thinks Tony. \nPeter\u2019s eyes drift around the car. From Rhodey, through Nat, to Wanda, Clint, and Steve. They come to rest on Tony.\n\u201cThanks,\u201d he says. \u201cFor being on my team. I really appreciate it, you guys.\u201d\nAs cavity inducing as it is to see Nat purse her lips and look away, eyes damp, a distant thought drifts into Tony\u2019s mind. A secret that came out during his fight with Steve that he\u2019d subconsciously filed away for later.\n \u201cClint?\u201d Tony asks. \u201cWhat did Steve mean when he said you knew Midtown\u2019s ventilation system like the back of your hand?\u201d"
