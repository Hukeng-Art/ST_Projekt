    "notes": "<p>Here's another fic in this series! It would be best to read \"Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now\" and \"The Mess We've Left Behind\" first, but if any of you want to jump straight into this one - basically, Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian have time traveled back to their younger bodies, and this all happened midway through the events at the Guanyin Temple, pre-confession scene. They ended up in the middle of class on their first day, and ended up going to hell with it, and confessing in front of everyone. And then they ran off and eloped, and everyone was very, very confused, since as far as they knew, LWJ and WWX didn't even know each other.</p>\n<p>This fic will take place in multiple scenes spanning different amounts of time after the events of these previous two fics. There will be five smaller stories in total that make up this fic.</p>\n<p>A-Yuan will be showing up in this, in the last of these fics, which will be in the next chapter I post! </p>\n<p>Hope you guys enjoy this :D</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_1_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>So, I finally decided to write another fic for this series! And it literally all spanned from one comment on another one of my fics from Dandelion_sama that said: \"There's this a simple , practical method to drive people ending their seclusion quickly, that even the infamous live only for seclusion, qingheng jun, would fall for it and end his seclusion, and reunite with his family....\"</p>\n<p> and that made me really want to write a fic where this happens, and then I thought about this series, and somehow ended up coming up with a bunch of other ideas...and then this happened.</p>\n<p> So this is basically happening in multiple little drabbles (well they were meant to be little, and some might be smaller than others but...yeah they really didn't end up being that small haha. So maybe mini-oneshots?) that take place in the Wangxian time travel universe. I've basically written the whole thing already so chapter 2 will come out sometime this week.</p>\n<p> Chapter 2 will include 3 mini stories: \"Jin Zixuan Learns Something New\" \"The Death of Wen Ruohan\" and \"Meet Our New Child!\" (this last one will have A-Yuan showing up! So look forward to that haha)</p>\n<p> Hope you guys enjoy this! The response to my other two stories in this series has been unbelievable, so thank you to all of you guys for that :D</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_2_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>So the end is here (so far anyway). Who knows though, I might end up writing more for this in the future...and if I do, I'll most likely just end up adding onto this fic.</p>\n<p>That being said, if you guys have any ideas/requests you would like me to write for this, feel free to mention them in the comments! Can't promise I'll get to them straight away, or if I'd be able to add them to this series, but I'll see what I can do!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_3_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Just a short chapter based on a bunch of comments left on the previous chapter - quite a few of you mentioned how funny it would be if Jingyi somehow ended up as the heir, and that gave me inspiration to write this. Hopefully you guys enjoy it, and feel free to give me suggestions/ideas for potential future chapters! </p>\n<p>(Also, why do I just seem to love torturing LQR in my fics? xD) </p>\n<p>Also, I have no idea if Jingyi is his birth name or courtesy name, and I'm assuming courtesy name, but I absolutely suck at coming up with original names, so I'm just sticking with Jingyi here haha</p>\n<p>Hope you guys enjoyed this! :)</p>",
    "text": "\n A Visit to Lotus Pier \n\nIt happened a few days after their return from their honeymoon (a full week of sight-seeing, sex, and putting their future plans into place). Wei Wuxian had spent the last few days in a state of bliss and excitement. He had travelled to the past, and he had a chance to put a stop to the horrors of the future \u2014 and, if that wasn\u2019t enough of a blessing, he had Lan Wangji, his Lan Zhan, by his side.\u00a0\nLan Zhan loved him. Lan Zhan was his husband.\u00a0\nThe excitement of the last few days seemed to have kept the nightmares at bay, but after the pain he had experienced in his own timeline, Wei Wuxian was hardly going to just forget about all of it. He woke up suddenly that night, thrashing in the sheets, crying out for his sister.\n\u201cWei Ying!\u201d Lan Wangji cried, his eyes wide in concern.\n\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian sobbed, curled in his husband\u2019s embrace. \u201cLan Zhan\u2026I need to go to Lotus Pier.\u201d\nIt was the middle of the night, and perhaps it would be best to wait until the morning, and tell everyone where they were going. They were technically students at the moment, and they hadn\u2019t done a very good job at hiding who they were to begin with.\nAnd yet, all Wei Wuxian could think was, \u2018Shijie is alive. Shijie is ALIVE,\u2019 and there was no way he could go back to sleep and pretend that this revelation hadn\u2019t finally hit him at full force. He needed to see his sister.\u00a0\nLan Wangji didn\u2019t try to dissuade him, or tell him to wait. Instead, his wonderful husband helped him dress, and the two of them quickly mounted their swords (Wei Wuxian marvelling the feel of being on Suibian again at last), and headed off towards Lotus Pier.\n(The next morning, their exhausted relatives would wonder where they had vanished again).\n\u2026\nJiang Fengmian had been fully intending to tell his wife about Wei Wuxian\u2019s sudden marriage. The problem was, he just couldn\u2019t work out how to say it. The whole situation was just so bizarre, and he wasn\u2019t sure how to explain that their adopted son had run off with a boy he had only just met, and gotten married to him.\nYu Ziyuan would undoubtedly lose her mind, and Jiang Fengmian, exhausted after a long day having to deal with a furious Lan Qiren, and whatever the hell was going on with Wei Wuxian, had resolutely decided that he just didn\u2019t want to deal with it.\u00a0\nHe would wait until he had processed the whole situation, and then he would tell her.\u00a0\nOf course, he didn\u2019t foresee Wei Wuxian suddenly bursting into the dining room a few days later, dragging his new husband behind him. The Jiangs, who had just started their breakfast, all turned to stare at him.\n\u201cShijie!\u201d Wei Wuxian cried, throwing himself forward. \u201cShijie, I missed you so much!\u201d\n\u201cA-Xian!\u201d Jiang Yanli jumped to her feet, and rushed forward. She had never been able to say no to her little brothers, and she immediately gathered him into her arms, holding him close.\nMadam Yu was finally able to shake off her shock, and jumped to her feet, her expression quickly turning to one of rage. \u201cJust what is going on here?!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOh A-Xian, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Jiang Yanli asked, her eyes wide in concern. \u201cAre you alright? Are you hurt?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cA-Li!\u201d Madam Yu snapped. \u201cRemember your place. Wei Wuxian \u2014 I have no idea what you think you\u2019re doing here \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cI just missed you!\u201d Wei Wuxian sobbed, burying himself closer.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been gone for a week, A-Xian,\u201d Jiang Yanli said, with amusement in her voice. Though she knew she should probably do something to ease her mother\u2019s anger, her little brothers always came first. \u201cXianXian can\u2019t go a week without his big sister?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNo, XianXian can\u2019t,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, shaking his head. \u201cShijie, I have so much to tell you. I got married, you know?!\u201d\u00a0\nJiang Yanli, of course, thought that this was a joke. While Jiang Cheng had told her all about Wei Wuxian's 'horrific' confession, and how he and the Second Jade of Lan had disappeared together, he hadn't actually gotten around to telling his sister about the whole marriage part of it.\nMadam Yu, who scoffed in disgust, thought that this was a joke.\nJiang Fengmian grimaced and looked away, preparing himself for the inevitable fallout.\u00a0\n\u201cHas A-Xian been flirting with all of the girls in Gusu?\u201d Jiang Yanli asked, smiling teasingly.\u00a0\nLan Wangji\u2019s expression darkened. Wei Wuxian glanced at him, and then shook his head hurriedly. \u201cOh no, Shijie! No girls, just my Lan Zhan! He\u2019s all I need!\u201d And then he pulled himself out of his sister\u2019s hug, and walked over to Lan Wangji. \u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he said, \u201cthere\u2019s no reason to look like that! You\u2019re the love of my life, the only person, man or women, I\u2019ll ever need that way!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji said, ducking his head slightly.\n\u201cNo really!\u201d Wei Wuxian said insistently. \u201cI love you, remember? I fancy you, I whatever you \u2014 \u201d\nLan Wangji tugged him close, and murmured, his voice low, \u201cMark your words.\u201d\nWei Wuxian shuddered, suddenly feeling warm all over. The room seemed to melt away, and he momentarily forgot that he was surrounded by his family.\n\u201cA-Xian,\u201d Jiang Fengmian said, trying to keep his voice even, and hide the discomfort that he was feeling. \u201cI\u2026really don\u2019t think that this is the place.\u201d\nMadam Yu turned to him, her expression dangerous. Jiang Yanli continued to watch on, her eyes wide as she realised that this wasn\u2019t a joke after all.\n\u201cWhat,\u201d she hissed, \u201cis this?\u201d\u00a0\nJiang Fengmian shifted uncomfortably. \u201cMy Lady,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2026well, I had fully intended to tell you about all of this \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cAnd what\u00a0exactly is this?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201c\u2026It appears that A-Xian and the Second Master Lan have\u2026married each other?\u201d\nSilence.\n\u201cOh, and don\u2019t feel offended,\u201d Wei Wuxian added quickly. \u201cIt was really small \u2014 just the two of us, really. We didn\u2019t want a huge thing \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cExcuse me?!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd actually, it was a good way to save money, because who needs to waste so much on a huge wedding? All Lan Zhan and I really needed was each other!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cExplain to me,\u201d Madam Yu said, her voice thunderous, \u201cjust how you left for Gusu a little over a week ago, and you are somehow already married.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Wei Wuxian\u2019s brow furrowed slightly. \u201cOh no, we got married after the first day, we just took a week to - \u201d\n\u201cI think what A-Xian means,\u201d Jiang Fengmian said loudly, \u201cis that \u2014 well \u2014 \u201d And oh, Jiang Fengmian was honestly trying his best to diffuse the situation. He seemed to have forgotten that the very sound of his voice only served to make his wife angrier, and that there was really no way to make this seem less bizarre than it really was.\u00a0\n\u201cAre you actually defending this behaviour?!\u201d Madam Yu snapped. \u201cHe is our Head Disciple, and yet he acts to foolishly and rashly?! How does this look for our Sect? And what do Gusu Lan think they are doing, not even bothering to tell us \u2014 ?\u201d\u00a0\nJiang Fengmian winced and looked away.\u00a0\n\u201cSect Leader Jiang is aware of our marriage,\u201d Lan Wangji said. He had chosen to remain silent up until now, happy to let the adults carry out their argument while he quietly admired the beauty of his husband. Wei Wuxian simply looked radiant in his joy at seeing his family alive again.\n\n\u201cWHAT?!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u201cMother, Father,\u201d Jiang Yanli said, smiling gently. \u201cPerhaps I should take A-Xian and Young Master Lan outside while you two continue this discussion?\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely not \u2014 \u201d Madam Yu started to say, and then remembered that they currently had a guest from a very prominent sect. As furious as she was with the Lans at the moment, she was hardly going to embarrass her own sect in front of them.\n\u201cFine,\u201d she said at last. \u201cTake them out from my sight, right now, while your father explains exactly why he didn\u2019t tell me about this before.\u201d\n\u201cBy Madam Yu, by Uncle Jiang!\u201d Wei Wuxian said, waving cheerfully. \u201cI missed you!\u201d\n\u201cGet the hell out!\u201d\nWhen they were a far distance away from the dining room, Jiang Yanli turned to face the newlyweds. For a moment she simply watched them, and then turned to meet her brother\u2019s gaze, a small smile on her lips.\n\u201cA-Xian, you look happy,\u201d she said.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m very happy,\u201d Wei Wuxian agreed. \u201cI have Lan Zhan, and Shijie, and our family \u2014 how could I not be?\u201d\u00a0\nJiang Yanli laughed, shaking her head slightly. \u201cYou never knew how to do things half way, did you?\u201d She then turned to Lan Wangji, and the gentle expression morphed into something else. Wei Wuxian continued to bask in the joy of being with his two favourite people, but Lan Wangji, who was a master of minute changes to one\u2019s expression, could see the dangerous glint in her eyes.\u00a0\n\u201cYoung Master Lan,\u201d Jiang Yanli said, \u201cI think the two of us need to have a long chat.\u201d\nLan Wangji nodded. \u201cOf course.\u201d\u00a0\n...\n Qingheng-Jun\u2019s Nightmare  \nA short while after Wei Wuxian had moved to the Cloud Recesses permanently (much to the horror of Lan Qiren) a meeting was held, with Lan Qiren, Lan Xichen, and the Lan Elders in attendance.\u00a0\n\u201cSomething needs to be done,\u201d one of the elders said, his expression dark. \u201cThis cannot go on much longer.\u201d\nThere were nods and murmurs of agreement around the room.\n\u201cPerhaps someone can\u2026talk to them?\u201d Everyone exchanged wary glances, and no one volunteered to do so.\n\u201cPerhaps Lan Xichen should,\u201d another elder suggested. \u201cAfter all, Lan Wangji is his brother. It would be less uncomfortable for him.\u201d\nLan Xichen turned to him, not even able to hide his horror at the suggestion. \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d he said, momentarily forgetting to even pretend to be polite. \u201cI\u2026no. I cannot do that.\u201d\nLan Qiren shook his head. \u201cNo, Xichen shouldn\u2019t be punished for his brother\u2019s actions. If we can\u2019t outright tell them, then we\u2026then we need to come up with another solution.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps ask them to move permanently to Lotus Pier?\u201d someone suggested.\nThe fact that Lan Qiren was even considering letting his precious nephew go just proved how bad things really were.\nThe thing was, after getting married, Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian had discovered the joys of sex. They had, of course, decided that they would engage in such activities on an everyday basis. And while they would have proceeded to do this in their own timeline had they not been transported to the past, the first few weeks of wedded bliss would have taken place outside of the Cloud Recesses, as the two travelled for a few months.\nThis time, however, stuck in the bodies of their younger selves, they had chosen to remain in the Cloud Recesses. And so the days and nights of passion and lust had begun, with Lan Wangji even more enraptured than ever at the sight of his beloved husband back in his own body.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian and Lan Wangji had no inhibitions when it came to sex. They were vigorous, wild, engulfed with desire, ridiculously kinky, and very, very loud.\u00a0\nThe Cloud Recesses, a quiet place to begin with, just wasn\u2019t equipped to deal with this level of newly wedded bliss.\u00a0\nFinally, after many sleepless nights, awkward meetings while they tried to come up with a solution (with no one feeling comfortable with simply walking over and telling them to quieten down a bit), and furiously cursing Wei Wuxian\u2019s existence, they finally decided that the Jingshi was simply too close to everyone else\u2019s quarters.\nLan Xichen approached his brother and brother-in-law, and informed them that he and his uncle had decided that Lan Wangji would now need a bigger home, what with him being married and all. A new, bigger house would be built for them as soon as possible.\nWei Wuxian beamed widely, happy that it seemed like people were actually accepting him this time around. Lan Wangji did not suspect that his beloved older brother had any ulterior motives, and agreed. Besides, a bigger house would be useful whenever he and Wei Wuxian decided to start a family (his mind momentarily moved to A-Yuan. \u2018Someday soon,\u2019 he thought to himself).\u00a0\nAnd so, a new house was built for them, far, far away from where the other homes and disciple quarters were situated. Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian moved, and things seemed to quiet down almost immediately.\u00a0\nThey had of course forgotten that the area where Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian\u2019s new home was built wasn\u2019t quite as secluded as they\u2019d initially thought. Someone else lived there too, far away from everyone else so that he could continue his seclusion uninterrupted.\n\u2026\nQinghheng-Jun woke up the first night after Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji had moved into their new home to the sound of two lustful newly weds going at it. He lay silently in his bed, staring at the ceiling and wondering if he had finally lost his mind.\n\u201cOh Er-gege,\u201d an unfamiliar voice screamed, \u201coh, how cruel, your husband is such a fragile man \u2014 no, don\u2019t stop, oh yes Hanguang-Jun, break me, tear me apart, destroy this wretched Yiling Patriarch utterly and completely \u2014 \u201d\nQingheng-Jun lay in bed, staring blankly in muted horror, unsure of what to do. When the screaming and banging finally stopped, it was well into the night, and his head felt like it was about to explode.\u00a0\nHe fell into an uneasy sleep, and woke up when it all started again a few hours later.\u00a0\nQingheng-Jun lasted a total of two days before it all just became a bit too much to bare. Perhaps he just hadn\u2019t had human contact in a very long time, but he just couldn\u2019t deal with it. He wasn\u2019t a fool, he knew that those were the sounds of two people having sex. He just didn\u2019t understand why he could hear them; he had chosen to spent his seclusion here for a reason. He was supposed to be far away from everyone else, so that he could spend his days in silence.\n\u2018And HOW?!\u2019 he thought, feeling despair rush though him. \u2018How are they so loud? How do they do it that often, and for that long? And who TALKS that much during sex?!\u2019\u00a0\nHe wasn\u2019t sure who he was hearing, but imagined that it might have been one of the sect elders. The younger disciples all lived in the disciple quarters. He briefly thought of his brother, but then quickly pushed the thought away, because it was too horrifying to even ponder.\nHe didn\u2019t for a moment consider that it might be one of his sons, because to him, they were still just little boys.\nQingheng-Jun did not know about Lan Wangji\u2019s marriage. It wasn\u2019t that everyone had intentionally forgotten to tell him, it was just that\u2026well, no one really saw Qingheng-Jun these days. He barely ever broke his seclusion, and hadn\u2019t even seen his own sons in years. Lan Qiren had briefly thought about telling him, but amidst the stress of the whole situation, it had quickly slipped his mind.\nAnd so, for a while at least, Qingheng-Jun had continued his seclusion uninterrupted, blissfully unaware that his youngest son was now a married man. That all ended later that night when, after an hour or so of listening to the sounds of two people passionately going at it, Qingheng-Jun\u2019s self control shattered, and he found himself marching towards the neighbouring home in the middle of the night.\nHe knocked on the door loudly, his heart beating in his chest. It didn\u2019t even matter that he was supposed to be in seclusion, and that he hadn\u2019t spoken to anyone that wasn\u2019t his brother in years. Right now all he wanted was to make it stop.\u00a0\nFor a moment there was silent, and then Qingheng-Jun heard the sound of footsteps approaching the doorway from inside. The door swung open a moment later, and he found himself face-to-face with an unfamiliar teenager.\u00a0\nThe sight took him off guard for a moment. He had expecting someone a lot older. \u201cAh,\u201d he said, \u201cwould you \u2014 please keep it down?\u201d\u00a0\nHe was trying to regain his bearings, and had just barely managed to do so when another person appeared beside the unfamiliar teen.\nQingheng-Jun froze, and, for a moment, wondered if he was dreaming. Why else would his youngest son be here?\u00a0\nQingheng-Jun turned and looked around, wondering if he was at the wrong house. And yet there was nothing else in the nearby vicinity, which meant that the horrors of the last few nights had happened here, which meant that \u2014\u00a0\nQingheng-Jun stared forward blankly, unable to process any of it.\n\u201cFather?\u201d Lan Wangji said, sounding shocked.\nThe other teenager let out a noise of surprise. \u201cFather?\u201d he repeated. \u201cThis is your dad, Lan Zhan?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cFather, would you like to come inside?\u201d Lan Wangji sounded concerned. The other teenager was also watching him with wide eyes. They were in their bed clothes, their hair rumpled and out of place. The boy\u2019s shoulders were littered with marks and bruises that Qingheng-Jun hadn\u2019t seen on another person in a very long time.\nIgnoring their curious and concerned calls, he walked numbly back to his own home, and climbed into bed.\nThe noises started again later that night.\n\u2026\nThe next morning, the news quickly spread around the Cloud Recesses that Qingheng-Jun had broken his seclusion.\u00a0\nQingheng-Jun didn\u2019t even bother to be discrete, marching straight to his brothers rooms, and demanding to know what the hell was going on. Lan Qiren, suddenly remembering his brother, instantly paled. And if he felt maybe just the slightest big of vindictive pleasure, then he would never admit it out loud.\n\u201cWhat do you mean A-Zhan got married?!\u201d Qingheng-Jun demanded, when Lan Qiren had explained the whole story to him. His voice was slightly hysteric. \u201cHe\u2019s fifteen! He\u2019s still a child!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cDo you think any of this makes sense?\u201d Lan Qiren snapped. \u201cI never would have imagined that Wangji would do something like this, and then \u2014 then \u2014 \u201d He shook his head in frustration.\nQingheng-Jun sighed, closing his eyes. \u201cThey\u2019re like animals,\u201d he muttered. \u201cThey never stop. I \u2014 is this how it\u2019s like, nowadays? Is this what younger people do? Brother, I am honestly at a loss.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI am honestly trying not to think about it too much,\u201d Lan Qiren said. \u201cEvery time I do, I feel as if my mind is about to explode.\u201d He had also felt like bursting into tears on numerous occasions, but he wasn\u2019t going to tell his brother that.\nA moment of silence passed, as the brothers sat quietly, lost in their thoughts.\u00a0\n\u201cI suppose nothing can be done about it now,\u201d Qingheng-Jun sighed. \u201cI have come to a decision. As of now, I will be ending my seclusion, and resuming my duties within the sect.\u201d\nLan Qiren\u2019s eyes widened in surprise.\u00a0\n\u201cI have been away far too long. It is about time I spent some time with my sons.\u201d\u00a0\n\u2018My children are out of control,\u2019 he thought, but did not voice this thought out loud.\u00a0\nAlso, the thought of returning to his seclusion, and going back to that sounded like a nightmare. No, something had to change.\u00a0\n\u201cVery well then,\u201d Lan Qiren said, nodding. \u201cThat is probably for the best.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYes,\u201d Qingheng-Jun agreed. \u201cAnd brother? I think it would be best if I moved somewhere a bit closer to where everyone else is.\u201d\nAnd far, far away from them went unsaid.\u00a0\n\n\nJin Zixuan Learns Something New\u00a0\n\n\nIn Jin Zixuan\u2019s opinion, Wei Wuxian was an absolute lunatic.\u00a0\nWhat kind of person ran off and got married to someone they had known for less than an hour? He was completely out of his mind, and it drove Jin Zixuan crazy to think that this idiot somehow still had more control over his own life than Jin Zixuan had over his.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian could marry a person he had known for less than an hour, and he could choose to do that. Jin Zixuan? He was stuck with Jiang Yanli, the girl his parents had chosen for him, and nothing would ever change that.\nSo maybe he had said a few things he shouldn\u2019t have. He knew he wasn\u2019t respecting Maiden Jiang, or the Jiang Sect, but he wasn\u2019t in the mood to play nice. He wasn\u2019t happy about this engagement, and he couldn\u2019t understand why he should pretend to be.\nWei Wuxian had, unsurprisingly, punched him in the face. Jin Zixuan decided that he hated him even more.\u00a0\nHe had been fairly certain that Wei Wuxian would get kicked out after that whole mess. He already pushed it enough with all of his rule breaking, but there was no way Lan Qiren would tolerate physical violence as well.\u00a0\nThey now sat side-by-side in Lan Qiren\u2019s office, as he berated the both of them (which Jin Zixuan found pretty unfair, since he wasn\u2019t the one throwing punches around here).\n\u201cI have no choice but to expel you,\u201d Lan Qiren snapped. \u201cPack your bags, and prepare to go home right now.\u201d Was it just him, or did Lan Qiren sound way too happy when he said that?\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Wei Wuxian agreed, all too easily. \u201cSo, do I go back to the Jingshi right now\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou told me to go home,\u201d he said. \u201cI live in the Jingshi. Lan Zhan and I are married, remember?\u201d\nLan Qiren froze, and a dawning look of horror appeared on his face, as if he was only just remembering that there really was no getting rid of Wei Wuxian.\n\u201cI\u2019ll go back to the Jingshi now, but first, there\u2019s really something you should know, Uncle.\u201d Lan Qiren winced. \u201cYou see, I was actually doing Jin Zixuan a favour.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes! Peacock \u2014 \u201d He turned to Jin Zixuan. \u201cYour engagement to my sister will now be cancelled.\u201d\u00a0\nJin Zixuan froze, his eyes widening. That\u2026couldn\u2019t be true, right?\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s exactly what you wanted, isn't it? Well now you\u2019re free, and my Shijie is free of you. However, that isn\u2019t what I mean when I call this a favour.\"\nHe continued to watch Jin Zixuan, who he simply sat there, unsure of how to respond.\n\"Now, free of any expectations, you can realise yourself what a kind, gentle, selfless person my sister really is. And then you will fall over yourself trying to win her back, and trying to get her to notice you. And she\u2019ll accept you, even though she can do so much better, because that\u2019s the kind of person she is. Loyal. Caring. Devoted.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cBut that is for you to learn on your own.\u201d\nJin Zixuan stared at him. Any angry retorts seemed to have left him, and he honestly didn\u2019t know what to say to that.\nWei Wuxian stood up and walked out of the room.\n\u201cYou \u2014 Wei Wuxian!\u201d Lan Qiren spluttered. \u201cCome back here now! We aren\u2019t finished here.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is wrong with him?\u201d Jin Zixuan asked, more to himself than anything.\nLan Qiren simply grit his teeth in frustration.\n\u2026\nYears later Jin Zixuan would realise that \u2018Oh shit, Wei Wuxian was right, Jiang Yanli is amazing, I have realised the errors of my ways and please, please, please let her love me back and marry me,\u2019\u00a0\nIt was upon the arrival of this ground-breaking revelation, that Jin Zixuan would be cornered by Wei Wuxian, who turned out to be way more terrifying than he had ever imagined.\n\u201cPeacock,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, as way of greeting, \u201cif you even think of blurting out some half-hearted confession and running away because something like embarrassment stops you from giving my Shijie the best declaration of love ever, because that\u2019s nothing less than what she deserves, you will regret it.\u201d\nJin Zixuan stared. \u201cI\u2026how did you get into my room?\u201d\n\u201cNever mind that. Here.\u201d Wei Wuxian passed him a sheet of paper. Jin Zixuan stared down at it blankly. \u201cThat is a list of all of my Shijie\u2019s favourite things, places, hobbies \u2014 read it, learn it, and make sure that when you do tell her how you feel, you make her feel like the most special woman in the world, which she is. I want courting gifts, day trips, poetry, music, the most romantic words since mine and Lan Zhan\u2019s confession \u2014 \u201d\nJin Zixuan winced at the memory.\u00a0\n\u201c \u2014 and Shijie will get everything she deserves, is that understood?\u201d\u00a0\nJin Zixuan nodded numbly, and thought to himself, \u2018Didn\u2019t Lan Wangji meet you on a rooftop, have pre-marital sex with you, and then elope with you without telling anyone?\u2019\u00a0\nHe, of course, was not aware of the years of excruciating pining, misunderstandings, life-and-death situations, literal death, sieges, whippings, resurrections, and more misunderstandings that had made up the years of unknowing courtship that Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian had underwent.\n\u201cUh, Wei Wuxian,\u201d he said. \u201cHow exactly did you know I would change my mind about Maiden Jiang?\u201d\nWei Wuxian snorted. \u201cAre you kidding me? This is my Shijie we\u2019re talking about. You would be even more of an idiot than I thought if you didn\u2019t eventually realise how amazing she really is.\u201d\nWell, Jin Zixuan wasn\u2019t going to argue with that.\n\u2026\nAfter around a month of courtship, involving numerous gifts, visits to the prettiest locations he could think of, the freshest food he could get his hands on, poetry he spent many sleepless nights trying to squeeze out of a brain that had always thought poetry was rather ridiculous, an original song that he had paid someone to compose since he didn\u2019t have a musical bone in his body, and yet had spent every second of the time it was being created telling the composer exactly what he wanted, and exactly how it was supposed to capture the way Jiang Yanli made him feel, and think, and love, until the man had all but begged him to leave the room because he couldn\u2019t think \u2014 and all because Wei Wuxian hadn\u2019t been able to shut up about how romantic original songs were, and how Lan Wangji had written one just for him and named it Wangxian of all fucking things \u2014\u00a0\nWell. At long last, Jiang Yanli had accepted his feelings (and reassured him multiple times that a simple confession would have sufficed) and he was now engaged to the most wonderful woman in the entire world.\nHe did end up telling her all about his confrontation with her brother, because Jiang Yanli deserved nothing more than absolute honesty from her future husband, and also because he wanted Wei Wuxian to suffer just a bit.\nJiang Yanli giggled after hearing the whole story. \u201cYes, A-Xian can be very protective,\u201d she said simply. \u201cHe didn\u2019t tell you not to propose, did he? I think that means he approves.\u201d\nJin Zixuan blinked in surprise. Oh, he hadn\u2019t thought of it that way.\nJiang Yanli smiled, and decided not to say that while yes, her A-Xian was undoubtedly motivated by protection and love, it was probably a bit of payback as well. After all, upon hearing about his elopement with Lan Wangji, Jiang Yanli had demanded to know every single detail of their courtship and marriage from him \u2014 a task that had taken hours.\u00a0\nShe had, of course, only the best intentions in doing this. She had even given him plenty of food as they\u2019d spoken, some of Wei Wuxian\u2019s favourite dishes. And perhaps no one but Wei Wuxian could actually eat those dishes since they were basically death traps, but perhaps that had simply slipped her mind.\nTo his credit, Lan Wangji had finished every one of the bowls that Jiang Yanli had forced upon him.\n...\n\n\nThe Death of Wen Ruohan\n\n\nWhile away on their honeymoon, Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji had made sure that the entire week wasn\u2019t just filled with fun and games. Oh, they had undoubtedly had their fun (the disgruntled inn employees had been a testament to that), but they were fully aware that they had work to do as well.\u00a0\nAnd work they had. They\u2019d made a quick trip to Qishan, and had gotten themselves quickly acquainted with the branch family of the Wen Sect. The sight of the little family he had built for himself during his time in the Burial Mounds had made Wei Wuxian\u2019s heart clench, and he had burst into tears the moment he had managed to get away for a bit, crying for everything he had lost in the comforting embrace of his husband.\nThey had spent the next few days sightseeing around the Qishan area, and trying to convince Wen Qing that they weren\u2019t insane, and that they really were time travellers. Wen Qing had influence amongst her part of the family, and she was smart, and resourceful. And, importantly, she was one of the few branch family members that Wen Ruohan actually held in high regard.\nThey had managed to convince her, eventually. And after telling her enough about the horrors of the future that she was just as invested in changing events (although she had looked like she wanted to kill them where they stood when Wei Wuxian had mentioned Wen Ning\u2019s death), Wei Wuxian was pleased enough with their progress.\nThe rest of the year had involved the back and forth exchange of letters, and the occasional visit whenever they got the chance (and since Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji really didn\u2019t care about what anyone else thought, this was quite frequently), and soon the time came for them to enact their grand plan.\n\u201cYou\u2019re sure this is going to work?\u201d Wen Qing asked, her eyes narrowed slightly.\n\u201cWen Qing! Have some faith! This will definitely work,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, his cheeks puffed out as he tried to swallow a mouthful of rice while talking at the same time.\u00a0\nThey were sat around a table in Granny\u2019s home, cheerfully having lunch, not even worrying about the fact that in a few hours, they would be killing off Wen Ruohan, Wen Chao, and anyone else in the main branch of the Wen Sect. They had been the main threats during the Wen\u2019s bloody reign, the main source of support for Wen Ruohan.\nAfter multiple visits over the course of the year, Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji had quickly endeared themselves to the group that would have one day become the Wen Remnants.\u00a0\nWen Qing huffed, and turned to Lan Wangji. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d she asked him. \u201cDo we have a chance of pulling this off?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji said, and Wen Qing instantly relaxed. Wei Wuxian pouted; honestly, no one had any faith in his word.\n\u201cNot much to pull off,\u201d Uncle Four said, snorting. \u201cJust those two going in and killing everyone \u2014 and honestly, I don\u2019t understand how you\u2019re going to do it. This is Wen Ruohan we\u2019re talking about.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019re funeral, though.\u201d\nGranny gave him a whack on the head, scowling.\nWen Ning shifted uncomfortably in his seat, his gaze lowered. \u201cOh, be careful,\u201d he said.\u00a0\n\u201cNo really, we have this under control,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, smiling reassuringly. \u201cWen Qing informed us when the next meeting amongst the main clan would be \u2014 thanks for that by the way \u2014 and ensured that they would all be there. Lan Zhan and I definitely have this under control, okay? Trust me, we have a secret weapon that none of them will be expecting.\u201d Demonic cultivation that no one knew about could be an excellent bonus. \u201cAnd then when all of that is over, that\u2019s when you come in.\u201d\nHe gave them a wide, beaming smile. The others smiled back, a tad bit uncertainly. Wen Ning looked like he was sweating bullets, and Wen Qing let out a huff and prayed to the Gods that this would actually work out.\n\u2026\nA few hours later, Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji returned. The Wen remnants immediately sat up, pretending that they hadn\u2019t been silently panicking the whole time. Wen Ning had no such qualms, hurrying over to them, his eyes wide.\n\u201cYou\u2019re okay!\u201d he cried, eyes wide in relief. \u201cYoung Masters \u2014 are you alright? Are you \u2014 ?\u201d\n\u201cWen Ning, we\u2019re fine,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, laughing.\n\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji agreed. \u201cThey are all dead.\u201d\u00a0\nEveryone stared at him blankly. Oh, they had been reassured numerous times that everything would be fine, but they hadn\u2019t fully believed it until now. Lan Wangji didn\u2019t seem at all bothered by what he had said; he didn\u2019t like killing, and the Gusu Lan Sect disapproved of it, but he had taken his fair share of lives during the war.\nAnd to protect Wei Wuxian, and the people he cared about\u2026well, there was very little he wouldn\u2019t do.\n\u201cYou\u2026actually did it,\u201d Wen Qing said, sounding slightly stunned.\u00a0\n\u201cYes!\u201d\n\u201cHow though? Honestly \u2014 this is Wen Ruohan we\u2019re talking about! You don\u2019t just \u2014 walk in and kill him!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d Wei Wuxian agreed. \u201cBut we have the great Hanguang-Jun on our side \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cWho?\u201d Wen Ning asked, frowning slightly.\u00a0\n\u201c\u2026Ahh, never mind about that. I keep forgetting certain things haven\u2019t happened yet\u2026anyway, we also had something that Wen Ruohan absolutely did not see coming. So, we took him out with my demonic cultivation first; he was surprised because he hadn\u2019t seen anything like it, and he underestimated us, and that made it easy. And then when the main threat was out of the way, my corpses mostly took care of the rest. Lan Zhan finished off whoever was left.:\nSilence.\n\u201c\u2026I\u2019m going to get the alcohol out,\u201d Uncle Four announced.\n\u2026\n\u201cSect Leader Wen is dead,\u201d Lan Qiren told them when they returned to the Cloud Recesses a day later.\u00a0\n\u201cOh, how tragic,\u201d Wei Wuxian said. \u201cShould I send some flowers? Or some fruit? Lan Zhan, what do you think?\u201d\n\u201cFlowers and fruit,\u201d Lan Wangji said, after a brief moment of consideration.\nLan Qiren ground his teeth together, and wished for the days when his nephew was still perfect, and the world still made sense.\n\u2026\n\u201cSo\u2026tell me again, what exactly happened?\u201d\u00a0\nThe remaining sect leaders sat together in an impromptu meeting. Qingheng-Jun, having long since left his seclusion behind, was in attendance along with Lan Qiren.\n\u201cSect Leader Wen is dead, along with the entirety of the main branch of the Wen family,\u201d Lan Qiren said. \u201cAs for how they died\u2026well\u2026\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cIt appears that they were planning to attack and set fire to the Cloud Recesses. They engaged in a\u2026practice run-through of what would happen and\u2026and\u2026\u201d\nEveryone stared at him expectantly, as if they hadn\u2019t already heard the whole story many times before.\n\u201c\u2026It appears that they\u2026accidentally set themselves on fire\u2026\u201d\nThe room descended into silence as its occupants tried to process that.\nIn all actuality, Wen Qing and Wen Ning had set fire to the building to hide all evidence of the dead bodies. Wen Ning had then created a fake written document, with information about a planned siege on the Cloud Recesses, with plans to burn it down, and another document detailing the supposed contents of the meeting \u2014 a complete practice run-through of what would be happening once the attack would take place.\nOf course, none of this had actually happened, but it wasn\u2019t like anyone else would know about it. Wei Wuxian had suggested the whole thing, finding it hilarious for reasons that the Wens still weren\u2019t sure about.\n\u201cThey accidentally set themselves on fire?\u201d Jiang Fengmian repeated.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Wen Ruohan accidentally set himself on fire?\u201d\u00a0\nLan Qiren sighed. \u201cYes.\u201d And then, as an afterthought, \u201cAnd both his sons, and every member of the main Wen family.\u201d\nIt sounded ridiculous even saying it out loud.\n\u201cDoes it really matter that much?\u201d Nie Mingjue asked. He had been in an excellent mood ever since learning that Wen Ruohan had died. The thought of him dying such a humiliating death even made up for the fact that it hadn\u2019t been Nie Mingjue himself who had killed him. \u201cHe\u2019s dead, and that\u2019s what matters.\u201d\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t sound so pleased about this,\u201d Jiang Fengmian said, in a tone that should have been admonishing. In all honesty, he really didn\u2019t care that much. This was all a huge relief.\u00a0\n\u201cAs if you all aren\u2019t just as happy about this,\u201d Nie Mingjue said, rolling his eyes. \u201cAnd look at this! He was planning on attacking the Cloud Recesses. He got what he deserved, in my opinion.\u201d\u00a0\nLan Qiren and Qingheng-Jun exchanged wary glances, all too aware of Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian\u2019s suspicious departure and return during the time of the deaths.\n\u201cApparently that doctor \u2014 Wen Qing \u2014 is now the leader of the Wen Sect,\u201d Nie Mingjue said. He didn\u2019t seem particularly bothered, though Lan Qiren had definitely taken a moment to process the idea of a women leading the Wen Sect when he had first heard the news.\u00a0\n\u201cYes,\u201d Jiang Fengmian agreed. \u201cThe entire main branch of the Wen family perished in the fire \u2014 \u201d\nNie Mingjue let out a snort of laughter.\n\u201c \u2014 and only the branch family members are left. Wen Qing\u2019s brother apparently had no desire to take on the role, so she is now in charge.\u201d\u00a0\nThere was a moment of silence as they all tried to process the idea of Wen Ruohan dying in an accidental fire.\n(\u201cWhat exactly did A-Zhan and A-Xian do?\u201d Qingheng-Jun would later ask his brother, with an exhausted look on his face, as the two tried to contemplate what the hell their lives had become.\n\u201cIt\u2019s better we don\u2019t know,\u201d Lan Qiren would say, because it was better than saying, \u201cI have no bloody idea,\u201d or \u201cThis is your fault for marrying that damned woman. This is ALL her influence!\u201d).\nNie Mingjue swung back a jar of wine, grinning widely. \u00a0\n...\n\n\nMeet Our New Child!\u00a0\n\n\nLan Xichen had always prided himself on being one of the few people able to truly understand his brother. No matter what situation, he could always know what his brother was thinking or feeling.\nEver since Wei Wuxian had entered their lives, that talent seemed to have vanished. Nowadays, Lan Xichen didn\u2019t seem to know what his brother was thinking. Lan Wangji had gone from being a quiet, shy, repressed teenager to a married man, literally overnight. Lan Xichen had not seen that coming. Years later, he still couldn\u2019t figure out how he could ever have seen that coming.\u00a0\nOh, he definitely liked Wei Wuxian, and had soon come to see him as another little brother. That didn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t wish his life made just a bit more sense these days.\nTime passed, and Lan Xichen settled into a state of acceptance. His brother was strange, his brother-in-law was strange, but they were both happy, and they clearly loved each other, and Lan Xichen could work with that. Besides, he could handle their odd quirks.\u00a0\nOh so he thought, until they returned from their latest random disappearance. His brother was carrying a child, and neither he nor Wei Wuxian seemed surprised that he was there. Lan Xichen felt mounting dread build up inside him.\u00a0\n\u201cXichen-ge!\u201d Wei Wuxian called out, waving cheerfully. \u201cXichen-ge, guess what? We\u2019re parents now!\u201d\nLan Xichen stared.\n\u201cBrother,\u201d Lan Wangji said calmly, as if anything in this situation made any sense. \u201cThis is A-Yuan. He is Wei Ying and my son.\u201d\nSilence.\n\u201cHe is your nephew.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Lan Xichen said weakly. \u201cThat\u2026my nephew. Yes.\u201d\nThe child beamed up at him.\n\u201cI \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, where did this child come from?\u201d His brother and Wei Wuxian had told them that they had a quick trip to make, and had then disappeared for two weeks. It was hardly alarming these days, and Lan Xichen hadn\u2019t thought twice about it.\nShowing up again with a child was definitely not what he was expecting. Although, Lan Xichen supposed, it wasn\u2019t as strange as running off to marry someone you had only just met. And definitely not as strange as Lan Wangji running off to marry someone he had only just met.\nIt was still pretty strange though, and Lan Xichen was still trying to wrap his head around all of it.\nHis baby brother was a father now.\u00a0\nYes, these days, his life made very little sense.\n\u2026\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but who said you could be a parent?\u201d Jiang Cheng demanded.\n\u201cNo one,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, poking A-Yuan\u2019s cheek. The toddler beamed up at him. \u201cLan Zhan and I make great parents though!\u201d\n\u201cGranny,\u201d Lan Wangji reminded him.\n\u201cOh right\u2026Granny said we could be parents. This little one\u2019s mother passed away a few months ago, and his father was never really in the picture\u2026Granny was having a hard time taking care of him, what with her age and everything, and Lan Zhan and I just kind of bonded with him\u2026\u201d\n(Plus, it was A-Yuan, there was no way they wouldn\u2019t love him upon first glance).\n\u201cI don\u2019t get why you spend so much time with those Wens,\u201d Jiang Cheng said, shaking his head. He eyed the child, and then shook his head again. \u201cGod, that poor kid, having you for a dad.\u201d\nWei Wuxian scowled. \u201cHey! I happen to make a great dad! Right, Lan Zhan?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji said. \u201cWei Ying is a good father.\u201d\nWei Wuxian beamed.\u00a0\nJiang Cheng snorted. \u201cYeah sure, let\u2019s just pretend as if he doesn\u2019t agree with everything you say.\u201d\u00a0\nJiang Yanli watched A-Yuan with a smile on her face. The Jiang siblings, Lan Wangji, and the newest addition to the family were sat in the Jingshi, sipping on tea.\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s adorable, A-Xian,\u201d Jiang Yanli said, and nearly squealed in delight when A-Yuan smiled at her. Oh, she was definitely ready to have children of her own.\n(If she said this aloud to either of her brothers, they would probably lose their minds, and then head off to kill Jin Zixuan).\u00a0\n\u201cWelcome to the family, A-Yuan,\u201d she said.\u00a0\n\u201cLan Yuan,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, lifting the little toddler higher, and beaming at him. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you, little one.\u201d\nLan Wangji let out a hum of agreement, and moved to stand closer to his husband and son. Jiang Yanli and Jiang Cheng exchanged bewildered expressions, but didn\u2019t bother to voice how their brother could possibly miss a child he had just adopted. By now, they were used to Wei Wuxian\u2019s strange behaviour.\nMeanwhile, Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian watched their new son, a feeling of calm settling over them. Finally, their family was complete again. This time A-Yuan would grow up knowing the love of both of his parents, and his entire extended family. He would see his grandmother regularly, and all of his aunts, and uncles, and cousins. He would know exactly who he was, and would never feel ashamed of his family, or of his past. He would never know hurt, or pain, or hunger.\nThey would protect him this time around; they would keep him safe, and loved, and happy.\u00a0\nA-Yuan beamed up at the two people who already loved him more than the world, the final piece to their little family.\u00a0\n\u2026\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d Qinheng-Jun beamed widely, and took a large gulp of tea. \u201cBrother, I\u2019m a grandfather!\u201d\n\u201cOh God!\u201d Lan Qiren cried, and Qingheng-Jun mistook this for joy. He nodded happily.\u00a0\n\u201cYes! A-Zhan and A-Xian have adopted a little boy. His name is A-Yuan, and oh, he is simply adorable \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cWhere did they get a child from?! Who thought it would be a good idea to let Wei Wuxian raise a child?!\u201d Lan Qiren\u2019s voice was filled with despair, as his mind was suddenly filled with images of a young child dressed in the robes of the Lan Sect, advancing on him with a manic grin on his face as he prepared to shave off Lan Qiren\u2019s goatee.\u00a0\nNo child raised by Wei Wuxian would ever be the epitome of serenity and virtue, the very values of the Lan Sect that all its disciples should embody. Wei Wuxian would undoubtedly taint the poor child, and oh God, Lan Qiren would be forced to put up with him because he would be family.\u00a0\n\u201cIs it too late to send them to Lotus Pier?\u201d he asked shakily.\u00a0\n\u201cHmm?\u201d Qingheng-Jun glanced up from where he had been staring off into space, imagining an adorable toddler dressed in the Lan Sect white. Ever since ending his seclusion, and realising that his family had gone completely out of control while he was gone, Qingheng-Jun had thrown himself into a life of trying to be a family man. This was much to the frustration of Lan Qiren, who was all for his brother\u2019s change in attitude, until he realised that Qingheng-Jun utterly adored Wei Wuxian.\n\u201cWei Wuxian and Wangji,\u201d Lan Qiren said. \u201cIs it too late to ship them off to Lotus Pier?\u201d Yu Ziyuan might try to kill him, or at the very least cause him bodily harm, but he could deal with her. He wasn\u2019t sure how much longer he could deal with Wei Wuxian.\nQingheng-Jun\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cWhy on earth would we do that? Now Brother, I want to buy a gift for my new grandson \u2014 what do you think \u2014 ?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOh my god.\u201d Lan Qiren\u2019s face paled when a thought suddenly occurred to him. \u201cIf \u2014 if Xichen doesn\u2019t marry off and have children of his own, then will Wei Wuxian\u2019s child be the next Sect Leader after him?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYes, most likely,\u201d Qingheng-Jun said. \u201cNow, about that gift \u2014 \u201c\nLan Qiren stood up abruptly. \u201cI need to \u2014 I need to go and speak to the matchmakers,\u201d he said, hurrying to the doorway. \u201cWe need to marry Xichen off as soon as possible, and ensure the sanctity and values of this sect! A child raised by Wei Wuxian would utterly destroy everything that we stand for!\u201d\u00a0\nLan Qiren then dashed straight out of the room, either to hunt down a matchmaker, or find Lan Xichen and inform him that he would soon be getting married. \nQingheng-Jun hummed and sipped his tea, deciding that he would go and visit his new grandson again as soon as possible.\u00a0\n\n The Heir of Gusu Lan (otherwise known as, \u201cLan Qiren Makes a Big Mistake\u201d) \n\nLan Qiren spent the next year diligently trying to convince Lan Xichen to marry. He resorted to any methods possible \u2014 he contacted matchmakers, tried to subtly arrange outings between his nephew and any eligible woman he could find, tried to organise formal betrothals. Nothing seemed to work. It didn\u2019t help that everyone else in his family were too busy cooing over the hellspawn that was Wei Wuxian\u2019s child to try and help him in his crucial mission.\nHow could Xichen possibly be this opposed to marriage?! Just look at who he was related to!\nNow if Lan Qiren had maybe paid a bit more attention to his new grand-nephew, instead of obsessing over the future of the sect, he might have realised that the boy was absolutely perfect. Right now, his stress levels were through the roof, and getting to know a toddler was the last thing on his mind.\nPerhaps if he had, all of this could have been avoided. Instead, Lan Qiren persisted, deciding that if Lan Xichen refused to marry, then other measures would have to be taken.\n\u2026\nIt was perfectly fine if Lan Xichen decided not to marry, Lan Qiren thought. In fact, it was more than fine. Who needed any more spouses around here? Surely no one could be worse than Wei Wuxian, but did he really want to risk it?\nNo, he had come up with the perfect solution to make everyone happy. Lan Xichen could remain happily single for as long as he wanted, and Lan Qiren could sleep peacefully knowing that the future of their sect wasn\u2019t in the hands of Wei Wuxian\u2019s child.\nThe orphan boy he was dragging behind him would be happy too. He was getting a new family, a rise in rank \u2014 what was there to complain about?\nHis solution was perfect; Lan Xichen could remain single if he wanted. After all, you didn\u2019t need to be married to have a child. There were plenty of orphans around, though of course, the child would have to be of Lan blood. Lan Qiren wasn\u2019t risking anything else. This child would be respectful, and virtuous, and disciplined, and everything he had once thought Wangji to be until his worst nightmare had come true.\nThe small child, walking quietly and solemnly beside, him was perfect. A distant relative of the Lans, whose parents had recently died on a night hunt. Here was a child who was in need of comfort, and a family, and of course Lan Qiren would provide that for him.\nAnd if this child ensured that the Cloud Recesses wouldn\u2019t one day be ruled by a duplicate of Wei Wuxian, then he wasn\u2019t truly doing this for selfish reasons. This was for the good of the sect.\u00a0\nHe knocked on Lan Xichen\u2019s door. It opened a moment later, and his nephew stood in the doorway.\n\u201cUncle,\u201d Lan Xichen greeted.\n\u201cXichen,\u201d Lan Qiren said, and thrust the little boy towards him.\nLan Xichen stared. \u201cHello?\u201d he said uncertainly. \u201cUncle, who is this?\u201d\u00a0\nIt took Lan Qiren a moment to remember the child\u2019s name. \u201cThis is Lan Jingyi,\u201d he said. \u201cYour new son.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe has no parents,\u201d Lan Qiren said. \u201cYou have no child. It is a perfect match.\u201d He glanced down at Jingyi, who blinked up at him, looking quiet, and serious, and oh so perfect. \u201cAlways be obedient and virtuous, Jingyi. Don\u2019t let outside influences sway you.\u201d\nThe child blinked up at him in response.\u00a0\n\u201cUncle!\u201d Lan Xichen cried, with more than a little desperation in his voice.\u00a0\nLan Qiren turned around and strode away. He had done his job. Xichen would acclimatise soon enough; if Wei Wuxian could figure out how to raise a child, surely Xichen could do the same.\n\u2026\nWhat Lan Qiren failed to understand was that his initial assessment of Lan Jingyi was completely wrong. When he had first met Jingyi, the child had been consumed by grief by the recent loss of his parents. It had made him quiet and withdrawn, but this was hardly his usual temperament.\nJingyi, on a normal day, was loud, exuberant, talkative and loud. He was everything that Lan Qiren despised. Lan Qiren, unfortunately, would soon come to realise this.\nLan Xichen remained in a state of shock for some time after the adoption. He still couldn\u2019t seem to understand what had happened. Very little seemed to make sense these days.\nFor some reason, Wei Wuxian seemed to find the whole thing hilarious. He had cooed over Jingyi, cuddling him close while he beamed from ear to ear, his eyes shining with mirth. Even Lan Wangji had barely been able to hide his amusement, something Lan Xichen had seen clearly from the slight twitch of his lips, and the furrow of his brow.\nA-Yuan had adored his new cousin from the moment he had met him. Qingheng-Jun had just been excited to have another grandson to spoil. The man had well and truly become a family man these days, and every time Lan Xichen caught sight of his father playing with his new grandsons in the rabbit fields, he\u2019d wonder if he had walked into some parallel universe.\nHe voiced these thoughts out loud once, and Wei Wuxian had burst out laughing yet again. Sometimes, Lan Xichen just couldn\u2019t understand his brother-in-law.\nThe thing was, Lan Xichen wasn\u2019t ready to be a father. He hadn\u2019t even considered it, and here he was, in charge of a child, and not completely sure what he was doing.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry too much,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, grinning as they watched A-Yuan and Jingyi playing. \u201cSomething tells me that kid is going to grow up just fine.\u201d\n\u2026\nLan Xichen ended up utterly and completely adoring his son.\u00a0\nHe doted on him, and indulged him in pretty much everything. If anyone brought it up, he would just brush it off, and tell himself that his brother and Wei Wuxian were much worse with their own child.\nQingheng-Jun continued to fight for the title of grandfather of the year, something that Jiang Fengmian would happily battle him for.\u00a0\nThe children grew, and with them, their personalities blossomed. A-Yuan \u2014 now Sizhui \u2014 was calm, focused, and gentle, the very embodiment of a perfect Lan disciple. Oh, he had his devious side as well \u2014 how could he not, with Wei Wuxian for a parent \u2014 but he hid that well enough.\nBasically, he was everything that Lan Qiren wanted in a disciple.\nAnd Jingyi? If Lan Sizhui was the embodiment of the Lan Sect values, Lan Jingyi was the embodiment of everything that made up Wei Wuxian. He basically was Wei Wuxian in miniature Lan form.\nLan Qiren felt like he was living through a very long, very vivid nightmare, and he kept expecting to wake up and for all of this to go away. Xichen would still be childless, Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian would still be wreaking havoc, his brother would still be useless, and Sizhui \u2014 sweet, precious, perfect A-Yuan, who he had misunderstood so, so much \u2014 would still be the next sect heir after Lan Xichen.\nA nightmare. This had to be a nightmare. Lan Qiren couldn\u2019t have caused this \u2014 this travesty. If he had \u2014 if this was real \u2014 then that meant that this \u2014 this \u2014 deviant; this child that was the very epitome of what a Lan was not supposed to be, would one day be in charge of this sect.\nThis child, who spoke too loudly, who sounded like he was trying to burst eardrums when he laughed, who argued and spoke back to his elders, who pranked people, and who couldn\u2019t stay still if you glued him to his chair \u2014 this child would be the future leader of the Gusu Lan Sect.\nOh please, please let Lan Qiren be dead when that time came.\n\u2018No,\u2019 he thought a moment later. No, that would hardly be fair. He may be lying peacefully in his grave by that point, but could he really abandon his sect? He may not have to bear the brunt of his nightmare, but the future of his beloved sect was depending on him right now. Who else would do something about this? Not his brother, who was too busy chasing after his grandsons with hearts in his eyes, or Lan Xichen, who acted like his son was some perfect, innocent little thing, and not a devious little monster.\nNot Wangji, who he had long since given up on.\u00a0\nOh god, oh god, what could he do? There was nothing he could do. Lan Jingyi was now officially Lan Xichen\u2019s son, and there was no way that would ever change, and Xichen would (very politely of course) toss him off the edge of the Cloud Recesses if he even suggested it.\u00a0\n\u201cBrother,\u201d he said the next time he saw Qingheng-Jun, with some desperation in his voice. Qingheng-Jun may have too busy doting on his grandchildren and trying to make up for lost time with his sons to actually remember that he was still the Sect Leader, but he was still technically in charge. Maybe, just maybe, he would listen to reason.\n\u201cBrother, something must be done. We\u2026we need to change the line of succession, immediately. Sizhui must be the next heir after Xichen.\u201d\nQingheng-Jun, who was thinking about the trip he would be making to Caiyi Town with Jingyi and Sizhui later that day, absentmindedly hummed.\n\u201cYes?\u201d Lan Qiren asked eagerly. \u201cYou agree?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I think Jingyi will make a wonderful Sect Leader one day,\u201d he said absentmindedly. \u201cQiren, do you think I should take them to that little restaurant near the edge of town, or would the one near \u2014 \u201d\nLan Qiren whirled around and stormed away, feeling despair consume him.\nHe had done this. They could have had Sizhui as the future heir and hope of their sect, but he had been blinded by his anger at Wei Wuxian. Yes, Wei Wuxian was unruly, and wild, and uncontrollable, and he despised the man with every fibre of his being, but he had forgotten one very important fact \u2014 Sizhui was also Lan Wangji\u2019s son. And yes, Wangji may be corrupted by Wei Wuxian, but surely there was enough of his righteous nephew under the deviant, shameless menace that Wei Wuxian had turned him into, and surely that would be enough to lead Sizhui down the right path.\nIf only he had thought this through. If only he had waited.\u00a0\nNow, he had singlehandedly brought about the downfall of his sect. Someday, they would live in a world where Lan Jingyi was the leader of Gusu Lan.\n\u00a0"
