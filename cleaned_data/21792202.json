    "text": "As he stood in the doorway of the Library Pavilion, listening to Lan Wangij marvel at the curve of Wei Wuxian\u2019s neck, and feeling like he was on the brink of throwing up, Jiang Cheng wondered how he had ended up in this situation.\nIt was Nie Huaisang\u2019s fault; that much he was sure of.\u00a0\nTheir last trip to Caiyi Town had involved a quick trip to a more adult stall, secluded and a distance away from the rest of the market place, that Nie Huaisang had eagerly dragged him and Wei Wuxian to. While the two of them had looked around in wary embarrassment, Nie Huaisang had seemed disturbingly at home, picking things off the wooden stands and shamelessly asking the shopkeeper what they did.\nThe potion that apparently allowed a person to hear other people\u2019s lustful thoughts had particularly intrigued him.\n\u201cYou can actually hear their thoughts?\u201d\u00a0\nJiang Cheng thought it was a heap of bullshit.\nOr at least he had, until he had woken up that morning next to at empty bottle of Emperor\u2019s Smile, and an empty bottle of something else that he couldn\u2019t identify. He would later figure out that it was that ridiculous potion Nie Huaisang had purchased; and it wouldn\u2019t take him long to realise that it did exactly what it advertised.\nHe heard snippets of thoughts on his way to class that morning \u2014 someone thinking about the pretty female disciple he\u2019d caught a glimpse of the previous day, someone thinking about their sweetheart back at home \u2014 but it was easy enough to brush away all of those things as parts of conversations.\nHe really started to realise that something was wrong when he was sitting in class, and Nie Huaisang seemed to be repeatedly musing about the pornographic text he had read a few days prior.\nAfter a few moments of sitting in incredulous silence, wondering how no one was telling him to shut up, Jiang Cheng had decided to do it himself.\u00a0\nNie Huaisang had simply looked bewildered, and Jiang Cheng had been fervently told off by an angry teacher, who refused stand by and allow people to interrupt his class.\nBecause, as it turned out, no one else had spoken. And it was after that class that Nie Huaisang let him know, sheepishly rubbing the back of his neck, that Jiang Cheng had drunk the entire bottle of that potion the night before on a drunken dare. Jiang Cheng remembered he, Nie Huaisang and Wei Wuxian finishing off the bottles of Emperor\u2019s Smile that Wei Wuxian had snuck in after their trip to Caiyi Town, but he didn\u2019t remember much else about what had happened that night.\nHe still thought the effects of the potion sounded like utter bullshit, but after another hour of hearing stray thoughts that he would rather not know about \u2014 and, in some cases, visual images \u2014 he had soon come to realise that he was unfortunately stuck with this for some time.\nIt was okay. He didn\u2019t like this, but at least he was in Gusu, and the majority of the Lan disciples were completely repressed. It was mostly the guest disciples he had to worry about, and it wasn\u2019t too hard to block them out.\nHe had been doing just fine, until a series of thoughts had almost bowled him over as he had made his way back to his room. He caught words like 'pretty\u2019, and someone repeatedly rhapsodising about someone\u2019s beautiful smile, and lovely eyes, and soft hair, and they were just so goddamn loud.\nThe thoughts were unlike anything he had heard so far. The whole morning, he had been followed by fleeting words and images, and as awful as it was, once he had figured out what was going on, they weren\u2019t too difficult to try and ignore.\nThis was nothing like that. There was no ignoring this.\u00a0\nJiang Cheng shook his head and walked forward. Just ignore it, he told himself. That stupid potion had to have a time limit, this had to wear off soon.\nAs he neared the Library Pavillion, the thoughts seemed to increase in volume. It seemed like someone was yelling in his head, and if he heard the word \u2018beautiful\u2019 one more time, he was going to punch someone.\n\n\u2018His lips look so soft\u2026inappropriate! You must not \u2014 they are very nice though\u2026and his smile\u2026\u2019\n\nOh for godsake, he couldn\u2019t do this. When another attempt to block the words out failed, and he decided that he would probably go mad if he didn't do something soon, he turned around, and hurried in the general direction of where the thoughts were coming from. He could feel it, could feel them getting stronger, and he wasn\u2019t even sure what he was planning to do, but he just needed to get them to shut up somehow.\nHe flung the doors of the Library Pavilion open, and prepared himself to tell whoever the hell it was to shut the fuck up and take a cold bath (who cared if it made him look crazy, because he was pretty sure he would go insane if this didn\u2019t stop soon), and then came to an abrupt stop when he saw who was inside.\nWei Wuxian and Lan Wangji sat at one of the low tables, Lan Wangji staring at Wei Wuxian with his normal blank expression, and Wei Wuxian chattering away cheerily. They both glanced up at the interruption.\n\u201cJiang Cheng!\u201d Wei Wuxian said, waving. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\u00a0\nFor a moment Jiang Cheng just stood there, staring blankly. He looked around the room, expecting to see someone else \u2014 but no, it was just the two of them; Wei Wuxian grinning widely, and Lan Wangji looking like he was made of stone. Nothing strange there.\nAnd then Wei Wuxian fluttered his eyelashes teasingly at Lan Wangji, and Lan Wangji \u2014\nOh God.\nJiang Cheng was instantly hit by a wave of emotions that he couldn\u2019t even identify. Lan Wangji\u2019s thoughts were a muddled mess, but he could make out the other boy\u2019s awe and confusion as Lan Wangji tried to work through just why those actions had made him feel like this.\nJiang Cheng stared incredulously at the stoic boy, whose face remained blank and unchanging throughout all of it.\nOh God, this was crazy. He had obviously lost his mind, there was no way this was actually happening.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s very pretty \u2014 no, he\u2019s shameless. Undisciplined. I don\u2019t understand why I \u2014 '\u00a0\n\nWei Wuxian smiled brightly at Lan Wangji, and his thoughts stumbled to a sudden halt, and suddenly turned back into a jumble of thoughts and feelings that Jiang Cheng never wanted to be aware of.\n\u201cJiang Cheng? You\u2019re still here?\u201d Wei Wuxian called out, confused.\nLan Wangji turned to him, his eyes narrowing slightly.\nJiang Cheng turned around, and got the hell out of there.\n\u2026\nThe thing was \u2014 Jiang Cheng had made a point to more or less stay far away from Lan Wangji. It wasn\u2019t too hard, since he doubted the other boy wanted to be around him for prolonged periods of time either.\nBut for some reason, unlike other people, whose thoughts came in sudden snippets, and weren\u2019t too hard to block out, Lan Wangji was impossible. Any lustful thoughts he happened to have \u2014 and oh God, Jiang Cheng shuddered at the thought \u2014 were like a wave. It was almost impossible not to be hit by them, and almost impossible to block them out when they started.\nAnd they all seemed focused on Wei Wuxian.\u00a0\nJiang Cheng could only be relived that these thoughts were coming from a repressed Lan disciple, who obviously didn\u2019t know anything about intimacy, so the thoughts \u2014 as mortifying as they were, since they were all focused on Jiang Cheng\u2019s brother \u2014 were fairly innocent. Just admiration of Wei Wuxian\u2019s eyes, or his flowing hair, or his nimble hands, or the expanse of his neck \u2014\nAnd, oh god, Jiang Cheng was going to be sick if he followed that train of thought any further.\nThe thing was, as awful as it was, Jiang Cheng was aware that it could be so much worse.\nOf course, considering his luck, it did get worse. Much worse. Because his idiot of a brother had apparently thought it was a good idea to introduce the esteemed Second Master Lan to pornography. And Lan Wangij, who had never seen such sordid materials before, and who had reacted with the expected indignation and rage to Wei Wuxian\u2019s face, had quietly marvelled at such things that he had never seen before in his life.\u00a0\nAnd, almost subconsciously, had began replacing the scenes he had seen with him and Wei Wuxian.\nOf course, he couldn\u2019t be the esteemed Second Master of the Lan Sect without reacting with the appropriate amount of embarrassment, so he silently berated himself for such thoughts. And felt very ashamed.\nThat didn\u2019t seem to stop him though.\nSitting in class, Jiang Cheng stared down at his blank piece of paper, and realised that he was probably failing the upcoming text. Of course his stupid brother had to go and show that repressed idiot pornography a day before they actually had important things to learn. How was Jiang Cheng supposed to concentrate like this?!\nHe was torn between brutally murdering his brother, brutally murdering Lan Wangji, or running away to some secluded area far away from everyone until all of this was over.\nIt had to be stop at some point, right? There had to be a limit for how long this could go on for \u2014 this was Lan Wangji, for godsake. The man was famed for how emotionless he was; Jiang Cheng just didn\u2019t understand what was happening.\u00a0\n\u2018This is what you get for getting drunk with Nie Huaisang of all people,\u2019 he thought bitterly.\n\u2026\nJiang Cheng had spent most of his day trying to stay the hell away from Lan Wangji, which honestly wasn\u2019t too hard. Not that it helped much, since Lan Wangji\u2019s thoughts were like someone was screaming in his head. The only good thing was that they seemed to block out other thoughts, at least for the time being - although that wasn\u2019t much of a compromise since Jiang Cheng would take all of those over Lan Wangji\u2019s apparent obsession with Wei Wuxian.\nIt wasn\u2019t like that was the only thing on Lan Wangji's mind \u2014 far from it \u2014 but even a few thoughts here and there were more than enough to drive him crazy. And it was so much worse when Wei Wuxian was in a close proximity to Lan Wangji \u2014 Lan Wangji seemed unable to think of anything else, even though his face remained seemingly uninterested.\nJiang Cheng went to bed that night, hoping that at least sleep would give him some reprieve.\u00a0\nHe should have known he\u2019d never be that lucky.\nHe went to sleep and suddenly his brother was there. Wei Wuxian was bathed in light; there was literally a halo of it surrounding him, and he had the biggest smile on his face.\n\u201cEr-gege,\u201d his brother said, leaning closer and laughing teasingly, \u201cEr-gege, kiss me.\u201d\n\u201cMn,\u201d said a voice, definitely not Jiang Cheng\u2019s own, and oh god, something was pulling him closer, and his eyes are so pretty, his smile is so pretty, his lips look so soft \u2014 oh fuck, no, no, these weren\u2019t this thoughts, these weren\u2019t his fucking thoughts goddammit \u2014\u00a0\nHe woke up screaming in bed, and thrashing wildly. Wei Wuxian, asleep next to him, jolted awake, and fumbled around for his sword.\n\u201cGo back to sleep, you idiot!\u201d he snapped.\n\u201cJiang Cheng?\u201d Wei Wuxian slurred, still searching for a weapon. \u201cW\u2019as wrong, I\u2019ll protect \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cGo back to sleep! This is all your fault, Wei Wuxian!\u201d\n\n\u2026\nOkay, maybe he had been a bit harsh the previous night. Wei Wuxian was an idiot, but it wasn\u2019t his fault that Lan Wangji was apparently a pervert.\nHe also decided that he couldn\u2019t take much more of this, so he skipped class the next day and made an impromptu trip to Caiyi Town. He was going to go straight to that shop and ask them how the hell he could fix this.\nHe needed to fix this. His sanity depended on it.\nAfter arriving in Caiyi Town, he hurriedly made his way over to the store. It took him some time to find it, since he only had vague recollections of coming here the first time, and there was no way he was asking anyone for directions. He wasn\u2019t nearly as shameless as Wei Wuxian or Nie Huaisang.\nThe shopkeeper glanced up when he walked in, and shot him a look of amusement. \u201cYou\u2019re one of those Gusu students, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he asked. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be in class right now?\u201d\u00a0\nJiang Cheng ignored his question, and strode over to him. He was aware that he probably looked slightly unstable, but he couldn\u2019t help it. He\u2019d heard far too many unsavoury thoughts along the way here, and wasn\u2019t sure whether he should be more horrified about the fact that Caiyi Town was apparently filled to the brim with perverts, or that somehow, even this wasn\u2019t as bad as what awaited him back in the Cloud Recesses.\n\u201cYou need to help me,\u201d he said, with more than a bit of desperation in his voice. \u201cPlease \u2014 I drank that stupid potion and now I \u2014 now I have thoughts about kissing my brother in my head \u2014 \u201d\nThe shopkeeper blinked, and frowned slightly. \u201cYou know,\u201d he mused, \u201cI don\u2019t think I have anything that causes incestuous thoughts\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWha \u2014 no!\u201d Jiang Cheng cried. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant! My friend bought some \u2014 some sort of potion from you, and it\u2019s supposed to make you hear people\u2019s thoughts \u2014 \u201d\nThe man\u2019s eyes widened in realisation. \u201cAh, yes, I remember! You were in here a few days ago with two other boys, weren\u2019t you? That friend of yours purchased that particularly potion from me. Although it shouldn\u2019t have had any adverse affects\u2026\u201d He frowned thoughtfully. \u201cWhat exactly did you say was happening?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI keep hearing everyone\u2019s thoughts!\u201d he snapped. \u201cAnd \u2014 \u201d And one person\u2019s thoughts in particular, Jiang Cheng thought, with a shudder. \u201cPlease, you need to give me something to stop this.\u201d\nThe man shook his head and laughed slightly. Jiang Cheng was just about to snap that there really wasn\u2019t anything funny about his situation, when the man started speaking again. \u201cHow much of it did you drink, exactly?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know! The whole bottle?\u201d\nThe man\u2019s lips quirked slightly. \u201cWell, that\u2019d explain it. You\u2019re only supposed to take a sip \u2014 it isn\u2019t supposed to be very strong. People usually drink a bit right before sex \u2014 \u201d Jiang Cheng flushed, averting his gaze, \u201c \u2014 to make the whole experience a bit more interesting. It makes you hear your lover\u2019s lustful thoughts. It\u2019s only supposed to last a few hours. Since it is designed to amplify certain thoughts depending on how strong the emotion behind them is \u2014 for instance, if you are in a room with your lover, those thoughts will be a lot stronger than, say, a stray thought from someone who is passing by \u2014 it shouldn\u2019t be strong enough for you to hear more than the thoughts of the person who is in the room with you.\u201d\nJiang Cheng was almost bright red by the end of this explanation, but he forced himself to carry on. \u201cThat\u2019s not what\u2019s happened to me,\u201d he bit out. \u201cI am hearing everyone\u2019s thoughts. I can\u2019t shut them out.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d the shopkeeper agreed, \u201cbecause you went and drank the whole damn bottle. It\u2019s too strong \u2014 you\u2019re hearing what everyone is thinking. And if there is a lot of emotion behind those thoughts \u2014 say, if someone is in love \u2014 then those thoughts are going to be a whole lot stronger. And a whole lot louder.\u201d\u00a0\nJiang Cheng paled. Yes, Lan Wangji\u2019s thoughts about Wei Wuxian\u2019s were loud \u2014 they blazed over everyone else\u2019s, leaving Jiang Cheng wanting nothing more than to scream at the other man to just shut the hell up \u2014 but there was no way he could actually be in love with his idiot brother, right?\nThis was Lan Wangji they were talking about.\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 he thought, \u2018and up until yesterday, there was no way you would have ever thought the unmovable Second Jade of Lan could be thinking such things about anyone, let alone Wei Wuxian.\u2019\u00a0\nHe shook his head, and refocused his attention on the shopkeeper. \u201cHow do I stop it?\u201d he asked, his voice desperate.\u00a0\nThe man shrugged. \u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d he replied, without an ounce of regret in his voice. The bastard actually had the gall to sound amused by Jiang Cheng\u2019s plight. \u201cIt should last a few more days, and then just fade on its own.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cA few more \u2014 I don\u2019t have a few more days!\u201d Jiang Cheng protested.\u00a0\n\u201cIt won\u2019t kill you.\u201d\n\u201cYes it will! You don\u2019t understand \u2014 there\u2019s this boy \u2014 \u201d\nThe man raised an eyebrow. \u201cAhh, I see,\u201d he said teasingly, \u201cis there someone you are fond of?\u201d\u00a0\nJiang Cheng spluttered indignantly. \u201cNo!\u201d he snapped. \u201cThere is a boy who is thinking indecent thoughts about my brother! I can\u2019t take much more of this! The other day, he was dreaming about kissing him! In class he was \u2014 he was \u2014 \u201d Oh God, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to talk about the pornography. He quickly moved onwards. \u201cI just need to find some way to stop this, before I really lose my mind.\u201d\nThe man shrugged again. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, but there\u2019s nothing I can do. Next time, you should really find out about how to properly handle a product before you use it.\u201d\u00a0\nJiang Cheng glared visciously, not wanting to say that he had done it on a drunken dare.\n\u2026\nAs he made his way back to the Cloud Recesses, Jiang Cheng quietly resolved to at least try to ignore that bastard Lan Wangji until the effects of the potion wore off.\nHe didn\u2019t know whether he could actually pull it off, but he would try his best. He needed to. If he went on listening to all of these thoughts, he would either go mad, or get kicked out of the Cloud Recesses after trying to assault their second young master.\nHe wasn\u2019t sure how he felt about Lan Wangji apparently having feelings for his brother. Feelings that were, apparently, strong enough that they may even be considered love. It was bewildering, and more than a little alarming, and he felt the stirrings of protective instinct towards his brother.\u00a0\nFor years, he had always tried to protect his beloved big sister from any unwanted attention from men. He had never thought he would need to defend Wei Wuxian\u2019s honour, and yet here he was, suddenly feeling the need to rush to his brother\u2019s defence as if he were some fair maiden.\nIt was utterly ridiculous.\u00a0\nJiang Cheng\u2019s brother was an idiot, but he had no doubt that Wei Wuxian was completely oblivious about what was happening. He would have no idea that all of his mindless teasing had lead to \u2014 to \u2014\nHe really needed to stop thinking about this.\nHe went back to the Cloud Recesses, somehow managing to avoid being caught by any Lan disciples or teachers, and made a point to ignore the foreign thoughts bouncing around his head as much as he could.\nHe did a fairly good job of it \u2014 or at least, he tried to convince himself that he was doing a good job of it \u2014 until he found himself walking side-by-side with Nie Huaisang and Wei Wuxian the next day, and Lan Wangji came into view.\nJiang Cheng immediately stiffened, but thankfully, there didn\u2019t seem to be any thoughts coming from the other boy at that moment. Before he could relax, Wei Wuxian caught sight of him, and, grinning widely, rushed forward, crying, \u201cLan Zhan! Lan Zhan, look at me! Er-gege \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s really going to kill you one of these days,\u201d Nie Huaisang called after him.\nJiang Cheng barely heard him, stuck in a frozen state of horror. All he could think of was that awful dream, and Wei Wuxian, bathed in a halo of light, giggling and calling out for \u2018Er-gege\u2019 to kiss him.\nNie Huaisang frowned. \u201cJiang-xiong, are you okay?\u201d\nJiang Cheng broke out of his reverie, and rushed forward. He grabbed Wei Wuxian\u2019s arm, and yanked him around. Across from them, Lan Wangji had heard Wei Wuxian\u2019s cries \u2014 a deaf man probably could have heard the noise his brother was making \u2014 and was now staring at them with a stony expression on his face.\n\u2018So pretty,\u2019 Lan Wangji thought, full of awe, and if Jiang Cheng were in a better state of mind, he would have marvelled at how the man could manage that when his face still looked like a brick wall.\nAs it was, he was too busy dragging his idiot brother as far away from Lan Wangji as he could manage.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Wei Wuxian demanded once they were a safe distance away.\nJiang Cheng did hesitate for a moment. It wasn\u2019t like he wanted Wei Wuxian to know about this; telling him seemed like a sure way to equip his brother with enough material to mock him for the next year.\u00a0\nHowever, he was also aware that Lan Wangji was apparently besotted with Wei Wuxian, and the oblivious moron in front of him had absolutely no idea. If he didn\u2019t do something now, Wei Wuxian would continue throwing himself at Lan Wangji, giggling, and teasing him, and doing god knows whatever else, while Lan Wangji silently lapped it up.\nLike hell Jiang Cheng was going to let that happen. Wei Wuxian may have been a complete idiot, but he was also his brother. As the only one of them with an ounce of common sense, it was Jiang Cheng\u2019s job to look out for him.\n\u201cLan Wangji is a pervert,\u201d he said at last. Perhaps that was a bit of an exaggeration, but Jiang Cheng, still suffering from the aftermath of that horrible dream, certainly didn\u2019t think so. \u201cYou need to stay away from him.\u201d\nWei Wuxian burst into laughter. \u201cHa! Good one, Jiang Cheng!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not joking, you idiot! He\u2019s \u2014 \u201d God, there was no way around this, was there? He was really going to have to tell his brother about the potion. \u201cLook, do you remember when we went to Caiyi Town with Nie Huaisang, and he took us to that shop? The one with the\u2026\u201d He gestured vaguely, his cheeks turning red.\nWei Wuxian blinked, and nodded slowly. Jiang Cheng silently thanked the heavens, because if his brother was going to play oblivious for a moment longer, Jiang Cheng probably would have ended up breaking his legs.\n\u201cOkay. So remember the potion he picked up? The one that\u2019s supposed to make you hear other people\u2019s lustful thoughts? Well it works. It works unfortunately well. And I drank the whole goddamn thing, and now I can\u2019t stop hearing everyone\u2019s thoughts.\u201d\n\u201cJiang Cheng\u2026\u201d\n\u201cShut up and let me finish! It\u2019s fucking awful, okay? But you know what the worst part is? Lan Wangji. The guy is obsessed with you. He\u2019s \u2014 \u201c Oh God, he couldn\u2019t say it.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian stared, his mouth opening and closing for a moment. \u201c\u2026Good one,\u201d he said at last, laughing. \u201cJiang Cheng, you really had me there\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat the fuck?! This isn\u2019t a joke!\u201d he snapped, throwing his arms in the air. \u201cI am actually losing my mind here! And I was going to bury myself in a hole for the next few days and try to forget about all of this, but believe it or not, I actually feel kind of worried about you.\u201d\nWei Wuxian raised an eyebrow and said sceptically, \u201cBecause of Lan Zhan?\u201d\n\u201cYes! Because he wants to \u2014 do things with you!\u201d\nWei Wuxian stared. \u201cThings?\u201d\n\u201cThings! You know!\u201d Jiang Cheng gestured wildly. \u201cLike \u2014 kissing and stuff!\u201d\u00a0\nWei Wuxian started. His eyes widened in disbelief, and he shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019ve got it all wrong! Lan Zhan would never want to do anything like that with me! He doesn\u2019t even like me that much! He thinks I\u2019m annoying!\u201d He seemed almost sad at that last part, and it made Jiang Cheng want to shake him until he finally got it.\nGod, wasn\u2019t his brother supposed to be some sort of serial flirter? How was he this dense? And how had Jiang Cheng never noticed it before?\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t find you annoying,\u201d Jiang Cheng said, his words slow for emphasis. \u201cHe keeps thinking about your neck, and your hands, and your stupid lips.\u201d\nWei Wuxian\u2019s cheeks turned pink. \u201cHe called my lips stupid?\u201d he asked, his voice shaky.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m calling your lips stupid! And then you had to go and show him that stupid pornography, and he started thinking about you and him and \u2014 ugh, you know what, no. Forget that.\u201d If he went down that route, he probably would throw up. \u201cAnd then \u2014 and then he was dreaming about kissing you. And just now, he called you pretty \u2014 \u201d\nWei Wuxian let out a weird squeaking noise, and took a step backwards. His cheeks were bright pink.\nJiang Cheng took a shaky breath, and averted his gaze.\u00a0\n\u201cYou \u2014 you\u2019re serious?\u201d Wei Wuxian asked, his voice shaking slightly.\nJiang Cheng nodded. \u201cYes,\u201d he said, his voice firm. \u201cI\u2019m not making this up. This is a literal nightmare for me. And I\u2019m telling you this,\u201d he met his brother\u2019s gaze, his expression serious, \u201cbecause Lan Wangji obviously isn\u2019t the person you thought he was. He\u2019s not your friend. He\u2019s only around so much because he\u2019s having weird perverted thoughts about you.\u201d\n\u201cWeird perverted thoughts,\u201d Wei Wuxian repeated, his voice strange.\n\u201cYes!\u201d Jiang Cheng said, nodding hurriedly. \u201cSo you need to stay away from him okay?\u201d\nWei Wuxian continued to watch him, a strange expression on his face, but Jiang Cheng relaxed slightly. He was fairly certain he had gotten his point across, and Wei Wuxian seemed to believe him at the very least. Now hopefully they could put this behind them while he waited for the effects of this stupid potion to wear off.\n\u2026\nIt was a few hours later, when a barrage of thoughts slammed into him. Thoughts about how gorgeous his golden eyes were, and how smooth his hair was, how good he looked in white, how elegant, how strong, how good of a kisser he was \u2014 and then Jiang Cheng realised those thoughts were centred on Lan Wangji, and that the voice sounded horrifyingly familiar.\nTwo people rounded the corner a moment later, and Jiang Cheng found himself staring in a horrified stupor at the nightmare unfolding in front of him.\nIt wasn\u2019t even that they were being particularly obvious about it. Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji were standing in close proximity with each other, though it wasn\u2019t like they were being particularly handsy with each other. Wei Wuxian was obviously at least making an attempt to maintain some distance for Lan Wangji\u2019s sake, but they were also a lot closer than they usually would be, and Lan Wangji was making no effort to even pretend that he was annoyed by this.\nIt was there thoughts that gave them away though. Both of them were completely entranced with each other. While Wei Wuxian continued to wax poetry about Lan Wangji\u2019s beauty in his mind, Lan Wangji was pretty much doing the same about Wei Wuxian, and it all entwined together in some twisted horror story.\nAnd, oh dear God, they were so loud. If Jiang Cheng thought it was bad before, it was somehow worse now. It was like someone was slamming a fist repeatedly against his head. Hell, he would have gladly taken that over this any day.\nWorst of all \u2014 worse than anything he had ever seen or heard in his entire life \u2014 they were, in some sort of twisted cycle, repeatedly thinking of the moment that they had both kissed for the first time earlier that day.\nThey had kissed each other.\n\nWhy the hell had they KISSED each other?\u00a0\n\n\nAnd why did he have to know about any of this?!\n\nWei Wuxian lifted his gaze and met his, and for a moment, looked confused at the look of unadulterated horror on Jiang Cheng\u2019s face. Then, as if just remembering their talk earlier that day, his eyes widened in alarm.\n\u201cAh \u2014 \u201d He stepped away from Lan Wangji, shooting him a quick apologetic look. \u201cI just need to talk to Jiang Cheng quickly, okay Lan Zhan?\u201d\n\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji said, nodding. Wei Wuxian smiled, touching Lan Wangji\u2019s hand gently, before turning and hurrying towards Jiang Cheng.\n\u2018His hands are so soft,\u2019 Lan Wangji thought.\nJiang Cheng shuddered.\n\u201cWhat the fuck is that?\u201d Jiang Cheng demanded once Wei Wuxian was in front of him, not even caring if Lan Wangji was still in earshot. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing, and \u2014 what the hell are you thinking?!\u201d\u00a0\nWei Wuxian sighed. \u201cLook, I know \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cNo \u2014 literally, what the hell are you thinking?! You idiots are going to give me a headache at this rate!\u201d\nWei Wuxian\u2019s cheeks turned red, and he averted his gaze. \u201cLook, you told me Lan Zhan was thinking about kissing me \u2014 \u201d\nJiang Cheng had said a lot of things, including that Lan Wangji was a huge pervert. Apparently none of that had stuck.\n\u201c \u2014 And I went and confronted him about it! And, uh \u2014 it turns out he likes me! You were right. And so he kissed me. And I kissed back.\u201d\nWei Wuxian\u2019s eyes glazed over slightly, and \u2014\u00a0\n\nNo, no, NO.\n\n\u201cShut up!\u201d Jiang Cheng wailed, slamming his hands over his ears. Of course, it didn\u2019t do anything, and Wei Wuxian\u2019s eyes immediately widened in alarm.\n\u201cI can\u2019t help it!\u201d Wei Wuxian cried. \u201cIt was such a good kiss.\u201d\n\u201cJust stop thinking about it! I don\u2019t want to know, okay?!\u201d And God, remind him to never do anything nice for his brother again. He tried to look out for him, and this is what he got in return. He would be lucky if he returned to Lotus Pier with his sanity intact now.\nWei Wuxian shifted uncomfortably, and his expression was slightly sheepish. \u201cI\u2019ll try, okay?\u201d He said. \u201cIt\u2019s just really hard. I didn\u2019t even know I liked Lan Zhan until what you told me, and then I kept thinking about it, and realised I really wanted him to kiss me too \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cPlease just shut up,\u201d Jiang Cheng pleaded. \u201cJust \u2014 look, your \u2014 boyfriend, whatever he is, is waiting isn\u2019t he? Go annoy him, and leave me alone!\u201d\nHe all but ran away, ignoring Wei Wuxian as he called after him.\u00a0\nHe was going to go to his room, and bury himself under some blankets, and try to block out the entire world until the effects of this stupid potion disappeared. He didn\u2019t care if he got expelled for skipping classes; he would gladly face his mother\u2019s wrath and his father\u2019s disappointment if it meant never having those two idiots in his head ever again.\u00a0\nOh and he was kicking Wei Wuxian out. He could go and sleep with Lan Wangji for all Jiang Cheng cared \u2014\u00a0\nJiang Cheng twitched. Okay, maybe not with Lan Wangji, but he definitely wasn\u2019t coming anywhere near him until all of this was over.\n\u00a0\n...\n\u00a0\n\n Extra: \n\nLan Wangji was reading in the library pavilion when Wei Wuxian burst inside, eyes wide and cheeks flushed.\nLan Wangji\u2019s head lifted, and his eyes narrowed slightly. Wei Wuxian was fairly certain that he was getting ready to tell him off, and nothing about his expression screamed that he was even remotely interested in doing any of the things that Jiang Cheng had suggested.\u00a0\nBut \u2014 his brother hadn\u2019t been making any of that up. Wei Wuxian knew Jiang Cheng, and he knew when his brother was upset. Jiang Cheng had been genuinely horrified. Wei Wuxian was pretty sure he was telling the truth.\nThat or he was losing his mind, and face-to-face with Lan Wangji, Wei Wuxian was having second thoughts on whether it was a good idea to test that theory,\nStill, there was no way he could just ignore what his brother had told him. If Lan Zhan really did like him in that way \u2014 if he had really had those kind of thoughts about Wei Wuxian\u2026\nWell, if someone had told him about another boy thinking those kind of things about him before he had met Lan Wangji, he would have quickly brushed it off and said he wasn\u2019t interested; that he wasn\u2019t a cut-sleeve, that he liked girls.\nHowever, from the moment Jiang Cheng had told him, he had suddenly realised that he didn\u2019t mind. He actually liked the idea of Lan Wangji liking him in that way.\u00a0\nGod, he wanted those things to.\nAnd so, before the other boy had a chance to tell him off for excessive noise, or excessive speed, or whatever else was prohibited in the Cloud Recesses, Wei Wuxian found himself calling out, \u201cLan Zhan, Er-gege, do you want to kiss me?\u201d\u00a0\nLan Wangji froze.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay if you do! I think I want that too\u2026no, I know that I do. I, uh, I really like you! I think you\u2019re really great, and I love being around you and \u2014 Lan Zhan? You\u2019re not saying anything\u2026\u201d He shifted, feeling suddenly very embarrassed. Perhaps this was a bad idea. Maybe he had this all wrong, and Jiang Cheng was just losing his mind \u2014 in which case, he should probably be very, very concerned for his brother\u2019s mental health\u2026\nLan Wangji was frozen in his place, his expression unmoving. But then Wei Wuxian caught sight of the red staining the tips of his ears, and the barely perceptible tremble of his lips, and realised that the other boy was affected by his confession.\n\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Lan Wangji said, his voice shaking slightly. \u201cYou\u2019re teasing me about such things\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not teasing you!\u201d Wei Wuxian protested. \u201cI\u2019m serious, Er-gege! I promise.\u201d He watched Lan Wangji, taking in his expression, and realised, with a start, that there seemed to be a hint of fear in Lan Wangji\u2019s eyes.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian walked forward hesitantly, until he was standing a short distance away from Lan Wangji.\u00a0\n\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he said, his voice nervous, \u201ccan I kiss you\u2026?\u201d\u00a0\nLan Wangji\u2019s fists clenched at his sides, and he looked away. Wei Wuxian took a deep breath, his shoulders slumping slightly. He probably had read this all wrong. It was just like him, to get all worked up about this, to get so excited \u2014 so hopeful \u2014 and then for it all to be nothing but a huge mistake\u2026\nAnd then, suddenly, Lan Wangji was turning around, taking a step forward, and reaching out to grasp Wei Wuxian\u2019s shoulders. Wei Wuxian froze, his eyes widening in shock, and then there were a pair of soft, warm lips pressed against his.\nIt wasn\u2019t a long kiss; it was short, and hesitant, and tinged with nerves, but it still left Wei Wuxian\u2019s heart racing when Lan Wangji pulled away. The other boy was so close that Wei Wuxian could see the darker gold flecks in his eyes, and then he quickly averted his gaze, and pulled away.\nWei Wuxian reached out hurriedly and grabbed his arm, shaking his head. \u201cLan Zhan, that was so nice,\u201d he said, his voice as sincere as he could make it. He didn\u2019t want Lan Wangji to misunderstand again, or to think he was making a joke of this. \u201cYou\u2019re really great, you know that?\u201d\n\u201cRidiculous,\u201d Lan Wangji murmured softly, his ears pink.\nHe didn\u2019t pull away from his grasp, and Wei Wuxian felt his lips tug upwards in a wide grin. He still felt kind of nervous himself, but there was a tingling sensation in his stomach that felt more like excitement.\n\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he said, \u201ccan we do that again?\u201d\u00a0\nLan Wangji looked back at him, his expression soft, and Wei Wuxian felt his smile growing. Yes, he definitely wanted this."
