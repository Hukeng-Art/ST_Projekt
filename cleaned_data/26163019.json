    "text": "\"What do you use these notebooks for?\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe officer's eyes were cold and hard as stone as they pierced his eyes like an arrow.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMaybe even right through them and into his very heart, leaving a gaping hole of nothing but blackness.\n\u00a0\nEmptiness.\n\u00a0\n... and numbness.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWith wide eyes and growing horror, his gaze fell onto the figures behind the glass pane, the faint outline of his reflection blocking the clear view of the people behind it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut they were all far too familiar to him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe could have recognized them anywhere, even if it was pitch black in the room.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA\u0336i\u0336z\u0336a\u0336w\u0336a\u0336-s\u0336e\u0336n\u0336s\u0336e\u0336i\u0336 Eraserhead was there and a few other pro heroes and teachers at U.A, including Nedzu.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd Sir Nighteye.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n... and... All Might...\n\u00a0\n\n...o\u0336f\u0336 c\u0336o\u0336u\u0336r\u0336s\u0336e\u0336 h\u0336e\u0336'd\u0336 b\u0336e\u0336 h\u0336e\u0336r\u0336e\u0336 w\u0336h\u0336a\u0336t\u0336 h\u0336a\u0336d\u0336 h\u0336e\u0336 e\u0336x\u0336p\u0336e\u0336c\u0336t\u0336e\u0336\u2014\n\n\u00a0\n'Oh', he thought bitterly.\n\u00a0\n'U.A. was supposed to be different... I was a fool to think anything would change.'\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe last two weeks have been strange, to say the least.\n\u00a0\nAs he should have known, and as many problems in his life, everything started with his notebook.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSpecifically him forgetting his newest one in the classroom.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n'So stupid...', he thought. '...that all it had taken was h\u0336i\u0336s\u0336 n\u0336o\u0336t\u0336e\u0336b\u0336o\u0336o\u0336k\u0336 that thing, that stupid little thing.'\u00a0\nIt shouldn't have been a big deal, really, because even if someone found it, his name was written on it and the person could give it back.\u00a0\nBesides, those notebooks weren't a big deal at all, he wasn't hiding anything in them. Everyone knew his obsession with heroes and that he absolutely adored analyzing them, though the answer as to why he loved that hobby so much he always left unanswered.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNot that he didn't trust his friends, because he did! It took a lot of time and effort, but he could safely say that he trusted them with his life now, and yet the whole topic surrounding his quirkless past was still something he kept under wraps.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd those notebooks were a big part of it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey weren't just a hobby, they were also a coping mechanism to calm his mind, focus and not feel completely useless to society.\u00a0\nIt was the only thing that made him feel smart in middle school when the teachers continously faked his grades, and the children laughed about it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nAt least they couldn't fake the notebooks and amount of effort he put in them.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nHe was able to get Shinsou to open up to him thanks to them, after Izuku proposed different ways he could use his quirk and convinced him repeatedly that the quirk he had was so useful for underground work.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTodoroki had come to him, too. After the Hosu incident, both of them had come a lot closer and hung out in his room. That day, the green haired boy had pulled out his notebook and asked him questions about both sides of his quirk, proposing different ways to improve his weak points and fighting style. ((...and created a draft with the title Eat shit Endeavor, a compilation of evidences, stats and graphs that not only proved he was not worthy of being the number two hero but could also get him stripped of his title ;D yk, for later purposes ))\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo yeah, technically, he had nothing to worry about.\n\u00a0\nIt was fine.\n\u00a0\n... but then the next day, the book was gone.\n\u00a0\nHe had come to class in the morning, sitting down on his usual spot behind Kacchan and chattered away with Uraraka, who had greeted him after coming in moments later.\n\u00a0\nThen he remembered the notebook.\n\u00a0\nIzuku had subtly glanced around his table, then asked Uraraka if she had seen it, but the girl had shaken her head.\nHe vaguely heard Bakugou muttering 'stupid nerd, always loosing his shit', but didn't pay it any mind, instead opting to ask his other friends, who also denied having seen it.\n\u00a0\nWeird.\n\u00a0\nBut there wasn't much to worry about, Izuku had thought. After all, maybe a teacher had grabbed it and would give it back later.\n\u00a0\n\n[Come to think of it, maybe he could voice some of the ideas written there out loud during their next training session, especially because there were a few new techniques he wanted to try out with Kirishima, Urakaka and Shinsou... ]\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n... Then homeroom started.\n\u00a0\nIt was all good, until Aizawa's eyes fell on Midoriya, and the temperature in the room seemed to have dropped several degrees. No one except Izuku himself had noticed, because where everyone had gotten the ususal tired looks, he was greeted with the stone-cold, piercing glare Izuku remembered being directed at the League of Villains during various instances.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n... Did he... Do something wrong...?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nThe underground hero's eyes had lingered on him a while more, looking him up and down as if searching for something, before he abruptly turned away from the green haired boy and started the lesson with a quick roll call before getting to the actual topic.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAgain, the teacher had hesitated when calling his name, and when he did say it, it sounded distant and cold, wrong.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSomething was wrong, he concluded, but shrugged it off as the man simply having a bad day. It was no surprise he would show it on Midoriya of all people, after all, it was clear that he was his least favorite student, if the name 'Problem Child' was anything to go by.\n\u00a0\nBut even so, Izuku didn't pay the weird behavior any more attention and focused on going on with the day.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n... only to discover that it wasn't only Eraserhead who was behaving weirdly.\n\u00a0\nIn fact, except for Present Mic, everyone's expression seemed to have grown cold and calculating upon seeing him.\nEven All Might, All Might, the man he got his quirk from, his mentor, seemed a bit more different than usual. He was distant, movements stiff and words monotone as he explained the exercise they'd be doing today.\n\u00a0\nPresent Mic was the only \"normal\" one, which put Izuku's mind a little bit at ease.\nHe was just as loud as he normally was, his expression was just as bright as every other day and he called Midoriya 'Little Listener' just like all the other times.\n\u00a0\nBut if he was still on good terms with Midoriya, what was wrong with everyone else?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe next day, he had needed to use the bathroom for a moment during Midnight's class.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe heroine \u2014 clearly hesitant and distrustfully eyeing him up and down \u2014 excused him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOn the way to the bathroom, he wracked his head about what could have happened for everything to change so suddenly.\n\u00a0\n\nHad they found out about him being quirkless before U.A.?\n\n\u00a0\n\nHad he subconsciously done something to make everyone angry?\n\n\u00a0\n\nOr maybe they finally realised what a waste of time he actually was?\n\n\u00a0\nBecause the looks he was getting, they were the same ones he got from his old teachers in elementary and middle school. It made him extremely uncomfortable, because he had hoped U.A. would be different.\n\u00a0\nIn U.A., everyone had cared about him, had encouraged him and supported him from the start.... o\u0336r\u0336 s\u0336o\u0336 h\u0336e\u0336 t\u0336h\u0336o\u0336u\u0336g\u0336h\u0336t\u0336...\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom the very first day at the hero school, to the Sport's Festival, to the Hosu Incident, Bakugou's kidnapping, the Provisional License Exam and Eri's rescue, nobody had ever, EVER, behaved that way.\n\u00a0\nAnd his notebook was still nowhere to be found, too.\n\u00a0\nHe had to have been gone for no more than fifteen minutes, but when he came back to class, his breath caught in his throat at the sight.\n\u00a0\nStanding in the classroom was Eraserhead, seemingly just having finished saying something [maybe to the heroine who was holding a stack of paper in her hands that wasn't there before], and the whole class whipped around to stare at him with wide, suspecting eyes the moment he opened the door.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhat the hell was going on?\n\u00a0\nKacchan seemed angry and disbelieving, Uraraka and Iida were looking lost, and the rest of the class was eyeing him with those same cold and hard eyes as all the teachers. Guarded, his mind inquired. Suspecting.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut why?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe only ones not affected, though looking angered were Asui, Todoroki and Shinsou. ( a weird look on their faces, since they weren't the type to get angry easily.)\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs fast as he could, he dashed towards his seat and sat down, looking at the table to save himself from those looks.\n\u00a0\nEraserhead left and Midnight continued her lesson, but every once in a while, someone of his classmates would glance at him before drastically turning away when Midoriya looked at them, as if afraid of him glancing back at them.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhat was happening?!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThings only seemed to have gotten worse after that. A week after it all started, the teachers were going extra hard on him, the second week, almost all of his classmates had started avoiding him, and by the time the third week came around, even Uraraka and Iida had distanced themselves from him.\n\u00a0\nIt devastated him to no end.\n\u00a0\nWas he really that disgusting to be around?\n\u00a0\nHe thought he had finally made friends after attending U.A., but somehow, he was still a useless, disgusting, weird Deku to be around.\n\u00a0\nKirishima had stopped calling him Midori-bro.\n\u00a0\nKaminari had stopped slinging a hand over his shoulder in a friendly manner when the other wasn't expecting it.\n\u00a0\nMina stopped talking to him all together.\n\u00a0\nYaoyorouzu was always observing him with watchful and analytic eyes, as if searching for a flaw in his... whatever it was they started avoiding him because of.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nUraraka wasn't smiling around him anymore.\n\u00a0\nAnd Iida, though he tried not to show it, would shift away from him when he got too close.\n\u00a0\nAnd there were other things too.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe hadn't even heard his real name from them for all this time now.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt was always Deku.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt sounded sour, impersonal, just Deku, as if they were strangers, nothing more.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen Izuku had started writing in his new analysis notebook, the other one still nowhere to be found, the whole class seemed to shift uncomfortably in their seats. There were eyes on him, frigid and unforgiving, and slowly, the boy had put down the pen, not missing how everyone seemed to relax at that.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nWere they scared of his notebooks?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nBut that was ridiculous... They knew what was in them, what he wrote about, why did they look like that?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe next thing everyone had started to get creeped out about was the muttering.\n\u00a0\nIt was during class, where he started muttering again, only to have gotten shut up by Kaminari, who glared his way.\n\u00a0\nHis mouth and mind always ran faster than his hands, that's why he needed to sort and voice his thoughts out loud, to actually remember everything he needed for his analysis and schoolwork.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd now, in the span of a few weeks, they all made him think it was freakish and weird, that he should be ashamed of it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt wouldn't have bothered him were it his classmates from middle school, but those were his friends, or well, former friends... and it hurt, to see them look repelled at even his voice.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nWhy did it not bother them before, then?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nWith every passing day, it seemed that the whole school had turned against him, as if he was some kind of villain that they needed to get rid of.\n\u00a0\nBut he didn't understand.\n\u00a0\nHe risked his life, broke his bones for every single one of the people he considered friends, only to have them turn their backs on him?\n\u00a0\nAll Might, out of all people, treated him like an enemy, for God's sake!\n\u00a0\nHe wouldn't answer his calls, refused to meet up with the other, and started failing him in hero class.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe same went for the rest of the staff.\n\u00a0\nHe studied and studied, but somehow failed every test or barely passed and everytime they worked in pairs during the hero exercises, it was always Midoriya, useless Deku, who would get the role of the villain and nobody would be willing to pair up with him.\n\u00a0\nExcept for Todoroki, Tsuyu and Shinsou.\n\u00a0\nThe three of them were the only ones who were still willing to be friends with him. Whatever was going on, they knew about it, but still decided to be with him.\nHe could have asked them what was going on, but right now, them willingly choosing to stay with him was more than he could have asked for, and he was wanted to treasure that.\n\u00a0\nAnd if they didn't tell him themselves, it could mean they were threatened to keep quiet about it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKacchan was also one of the only people who didn't change. Still as loud and brash as ever, but after their fight at Ground Beta, they were starting to sort things out. Right now though, it seemed that he was ready to explode at everything and everyone, especially at the teachers.\nMaybe it also had something to do with why everyone was being so weird.\nThen again, if everyone was acting so hostile towards him, why wasn't Bakugou?\nSure, they had talked a bit about their feelings at Ground Beta, but their issues weren't resolved yet. So why...\n\u00a0\nThe green haired boy sighed.\n\u00a0\nThe only person within U.A.'s staff who was still incredibly kind to him was Present Mic. His eyes were warm and kind, he answered every question Izuku asked carefully and even explained small detail about his quirk that most likely counted as classified. And yet he trusted Izuku enough to tell him...\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYamada had actually seemed interested when the green haired boy showed him his notebook entry, amazed by the length of the analysis and amount of information he didn't even know was noticeable to the people around.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nToday though... Today was different. English was their last lesson, followed by lunch, and Hizashi was looking strangely sad and angry at the same time. No, scratch that, he was definitely seething.\nIzuku tried shrugging it off, but his stomach was churning at the thought of the last teacher who had been kind to him, suddenly changing like everyone else.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWas it just a play-pretend?\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nDid he not care about him after all?\n\n\u00a0\n\nWas it really just an act?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nFive minutes before the lesson ended, Present Mic spoke up.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"Hey Little Listener, could you please see me after class?\"\n\u00a0\nMidoriya's face fell. 'Don't be like that... You should have expected this...'\n\u00a0\nNodding mutely, the green haired boy felt himself panic, standing up stiffly and walking towards the teacher's desk. A small, secure pat on his shoulder and Shinsou opened his mouth.\n\u00a0\n\"We'll be waiting for you to eat lunch together, 'Zuku, okay?\"\n\u00a0\nThen they were gone as well and Midoriya was left alone with the blonde haired man.\nHe expected to get scolded, shouted at or even punched. Maybe told that he would get expelled.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nClosing his eyes in expectation, he never thought that two arms would pull him into his chest and hold him there.\n\u00a0\nHuh...\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe embrace was warm and secure, and slowly, Izuku felt himself relax into the teacher's hold and return the hug.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"Izuku listen\", Yamada began and the boy's eyes grew wide after hearing his given name from the mouth of a teacher.\n\u00a0\n\"I need you to listen carefully, little listener\", Yamada began and squeezed his student's shoulders from where he had gripped them tightly.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"I can't even begin to say how sorry I am, for everything and on behalf of everyone's behavior. I'm sorry , I'm really sorry, and I'm so sorry for what's going to happen. I wanted to tell you, I really wanted to, but if I did...\" he trailed off and shook his head in both fury and dejection.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe words \"the consequences would be grave\" were left hanging in the air, but there was no need in saying them out loud, for Izuku understood them clearly.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut... why?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhat could be this bad that even Present Mic himself was afraid?\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"I'm sorry, little one, so sorry...\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe door flew open with a loud bang, making the green haired boy flinch and whirl around, only to see several police officers storming in and advancing towards him whilst screaming to stand still.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe was completely helpless as they handcuffed and pulled him harshly towards the door again, holding back the blonde teacher who wanted to come with them.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhat was going on?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhy was this happening?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhat did he do wrong??\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOutside of the classroom, he saw the teachers look at him with enraged expressions on their faces. Some of his classmates were also there. Kirishima, Ashido, Shoji, Sero... They were all gazing at him as if he were some shit stain on the ground, a worthless Deku whose existence needed to get evaporated.\u00a0\nBut that's all he ever was to them, right?\u00a0\nAll those smiles and promises were fake, all of them were fake.\n\u00a0\nHe started panicking, motions frantic as he looked around in hopes of getting help from one of the students or teachers around him. The police officer's grip was painfully hard, tightening even more when he tried jerking his hands away, and the green haired boy winced.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"IZUKU!!\" He heard his name being shouted in the distance and looked up fast enough to catch a glimpse of purple and half white half red advancing towards him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n'Hitoshi, Shoto!!', his mind screamed, body already trying to scramble out of the officer's way and towards his two friends.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut he was too late, and before he could let out a single sound, he was forced head first into the police car.\n\u00a0\n'Just like a criminal', the green haired boy thought in disbelief, as the door closed and they drove off. He wanted to ask so badly what they were doing to him, why he was being handled like a criminal, a villain, but thought better than that.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt's just like in middle school.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYou speak up, you make everything worse.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd so they took off, Midoriya feeling smaller and more a Deku than ever before.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs they stopped in front of the police station, he was roughly grabbed by his shoulders, pressing on an old scar that still stung occasionally, and dragged inside.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhat he saw there made the last bit of light in his eyes die.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEraserhead was there, along with All Might, Sir Nighteye and Principal Nedzu.\u00a0\nBeside them stood at least ten police officers, all looking furious, and it was all directed at him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"Ai-Aizawa-sensei, what's go-going on?\" Midoriya stuttered out helplessly, but his homeroom teacher refused to even acknowledge the question, only glaring at him with a look that he couldn't quite place.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe was brought inside a room, which was completely empty, save for the table in the middle, and a chair on either side. Izuku was forcefully dragged to the seat where he could see the door and the glass pane, his handcuffed hands getting chained to the chair.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRealization struck him with cold terror as a chill went down his spine.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis was an interrogation room.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe was being interrogated... But why?\n\u00a0\nIt were approximately ten minutes later that the door swung open and the green haired boy flinched out of fear of what would happen next.\nThe police officer stopped beside the chair and pushed it away, opting to stand as he slammed a book onto the table.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"What do you use these notebooks for?\"\n\u00a0\nLooking down, Izuku realised that this was his analysis notebook he lost some time ago. He blinked a few times before looking at the officer with incomprehending eyes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe didn't understand...\n\u00a0\n\nWhy were they asking him that?\n\n\u00a0\nIzuku tried to answer as best as he could through his confusion, but that proved to be the wrong thing to do, because the man slammed his hands onto the table and screamed.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"DO NOT LIE TO ME!\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe officer's eyes were bright with unchecked anger and hard as stone, and all Izuku could do was stare with wide eyes and growing horror behind the glass, looking directly at his homeroom teacher, silently pleading for him to do something.\u00a0\nBut when he refused to look at the boy, only clenching his eyes shut and turning his head away, Midoriya felt tears gather in the corner of his eyes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd when he looked at everyone else, they only glared at him or looked away as well.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"What do you use these notebooks for?\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe policemen asked again.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"Have you ever given anyone those notebooks with the purpose of hurting someone?\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"Since when were you associated with the league of villains?\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"Do you sell any of that analysis to the League of Villains?\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd 'Oh', he thought bitterly. 'So that's what they mean....'\u00a0\n\u00a0\n'U.A. was supposed to be different... I was a fool to think anything would change.'\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFor the next two hours, the police officer continued barking questions at him, shouting and slamming and screaming even louder, not even caring when Izuku broke down completely, sobbing quietly whilst giving the same reply over and over again.\n\u00a0\nBut nobody believed him.\n\u00a0\nBy the time the third hour came around, he was in an almost catatonic state.\nEmotionless, unmoving and completely silent, staring at the table that still contained his notebook.\nTears were still slipping from his eyes, but he wasn't answering anymore.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe completely disassociated.\n\u00a0\nWhen the police officer left and detective Tsukauchi came in, the damage that had already been done was beyond repair.\n\u00a0\nThe man entered and took careful steps to come closer, eyes scanning the boy up and down before settling on his blank face.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis was no villain or traitor.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis was a child that's been broken, accused of something he wasn't, and failed in every way possible.\n\u00a0\nSitting down on the chair, Tsukauchi sighed before pulling out the sheets with all the questions he needed to ask the boy, every fiber of his body wanting to go against it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut he knew it needed to be done.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe was neither heartless nor cruel, but still bound to the same rules and laws the police was.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd if the majority wanted to interrogate Midoriya, any objection was useless.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd still...\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis boy had risked his life, broke his bones, shattered them and ended up in the hospital more times than he could count, all for the sake of his \"friends\" and teachers, only to get accused of something so ridiculous?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe was a stellar student, kind, forgiving, selfless and had a pure heart of gold.\n\u00a0\n\nThis was really who they thought was the traitor?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nCome on, couldn't they have done at least a little bit better in their choice?\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nLike seriously, and why the fuck didn't All Might defend him?! He was his successor, his \"boy\" and yet the \"Symbol-of-peace\" my ass was standing in front of the room as well, looking almost unbothered by the tumult going on here.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nAll Might was his friend, a very close one at that, but what the fuck was he thinking?!\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis precious boy isn't, wasn't, had never and could never, would never be a traitor.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd besides... After what happened at the USJ...\n\u00a0\nIf he would have been the traitor, that villain with the warp gate quirk, Kurogiri would have known which kid to teleport into which section.\n\u00a0\nBut they were divided into those different regions randomly, because they didn't know anything about the kids.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhich meant that there could not have been any help from inside U.A., especially not a first year who had not even known all names of his classmates at that time yet.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n'They all fucked up', Tsukauchi thought. 'I wonder how they plan on making this right.'\n\u00a0\nWhen he wrapped up the interrogation, unchained the boy and left the room to talk to Eraserhead and everyone else, Izuku still sat on the chair.\nHis mind was a dark void and he couldn't think about anything except what happened.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey thought he was a traitor...\nAfter everything he did for them...\u00a0\nThey thought he was a villain...\n\u00a0\nThere were noises outside the interrogation room, but Izuku couldn't care less. Slowly, as if on autopilot, he stood up, grabbed his notebook and opened the door.\nThe voices were even louder, he clearly heard them talking, but strangely couldn't make out a single word. Until...\n\u00a0\n\"IZUKU!\"\n\u00a0\nThe voices abruptly stopped and it was as if\u00a0 reality crashed down on him, because he suddenly became aware of how his eyes were still leaking tears, how his heart was aching and how he was trembling all over.\nHis vision was blurry, but he could make out two boys coming towards him...\n\"Hi-Hitoshi... Shouto...\" he whispered, before his knees buckled, and just before he crashed onto the floor, two strong arms wrapped around his body and pulled him into a broad chest.\nHe inhaled deeply and smelled lavender.\n'Hitoshi...'\n\u00a0\nBoth boys sank to the floor, and another hand came to rest on his back, making circle motions to calm him down.\n\u00a0\nAt the state of the boy, Shinsou and Todoroki were outraged. How could their teachers have done something like that?!\n\u00a0\nWeren't they supposed to be trusted?\n\u00a0\nHow could they have hurt their friend in such a cruel and heartless way?\n\u00a0\nIzuku continued sobbing into the purple haired boy's shoulder for a while, before he simply...stopped.\n\u00a0\nHe didn't have any tears left to cry.\n\u00a0\n'How could they have done that... After all I did for them...',\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAfter a while Midoriya tried standing up on wobbly feet, Todoroki and Shinsou steadying him.\n\u00a0\nHe heard another voice speak up.\n\"M-Midori-\"\n\u00a0\n\"Don't touch him!\" Hitoshi screamed.\n\u00a0\n\"Don't any of you dare come any closer to him!\"\n\u00a0\nAizawa, and Sir Nighteye halted in their tracks at the look of pure hate the two boys were giving them.\u00a0\nAizawa still tried taking a step forward. \"Listen-\"\n\u00a0\nIn less than a second, the floor was covered in ice and all the police officers and teachers were stuck in it.\n\"If any of you ever dare come any closer to him, you'll see who real villains are.\"\n\u00a0\nTodoroki leveled them with a glare colder than his ice, hostile and unforgiving, before the kids turned on their heels and started walking away towards the entrance of the police station, leaving everyone else behind.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOutside, the trio walked towards a white car.\u00a0\nThe front door of it opened and Present Mic came out.\n\"Hey, hey, how is he feeling?\" the blonde haired man asked Shinsou and Todoroki once he saw the unresponsive state Midoriya was in. Those blank eyes and stiff posture... It scared him to no end to see one of his brightest students like that.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShinsou and Todoroki merely shook their heads, but otherwise remained silent.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWith a pained sigh, Yamada led the trio towards the car, Todoroki sitting in the passenger seat, while Hitoshi and Izuku remained in the back seats.\u00a0\nStarting the car, they drove off back towards U.A. and to the dorms.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"H-Hitoshi...?\" Midoriya stuttered out somewhere during the ride. Instantly, the mind quirk user's attention was on him and he squeezed the boy's hand.\u00a0\n\"Izuku, how are you feeling?\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe greenette's gaze drifted away as his mind kept replaying what happened.\u00a0\n\"They... They think... I'm not...\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPutting his arms around him, Shinsou squeezed Izuku comfortingly whilst carding a hand through the forest green locks.\u00a0\n\"It's okay Izuku... I know... It's going to be okay...\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\n'Hopefully...', he silently added in his head.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOccasional hiccups were the only thing that could be heard in the car as they came closer to the school, and by the time the car stopped right in front of it, it was completely silent.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCarefully so as not to scare the green haired boy, Hitoshi took his hand and climbed out of the car, not letting go even when they came to stand in front of Heights Alliance. Todoroki was standing on the other side of Midoriya, and Present Mic already said goodbye to the three of them, promising to visit later.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"Are you ready?\" Shouto quietly asked, squeezing his friend's hand reassuringly when the other hesitated.\u00a0\n\"We'll go straight to your room, okay?\" Hitoshi promised and pushed open the door.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTheir steps were silent, but not intentionally so. Either way, nobody noticed them at first.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTsuyu was the first one.\u00a0\n\"Midoriya-chan, Shinsou-chan, Todoroki-chan, how are you?\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShouto and Hitoshi shrugged and glanced at Midoriya, who hasn't budged even after being addressed. But after Todoroki motioned with his head upstairs, she stood up and made her way over to the males, and together they continued their way upstairs towards Izuku's room.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"Hey guys! What's up?\" Ashido asked as she came around the corner, Kirishima, Sero and Kaminari with her.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTodoroki almost punched his classmates at the question.\u00a0\n\nHow dare they ask something like that after what they did?\u00a0\n\nThey group was casting nervous glances at Midoriya, clearly not aware that he was innocent.\u00a0\nThe half white half red haired teen was just about to retort something, when Shinsou unexpectedly spoke up.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"Good. And you?\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"Oh, we're\" - before Mina could continue, her eyes glazed over and her face went completely slack.\u00a0\n\"Leave\", Hitoshi commanded, her friends watching helplessly as she turned on her heels and walked into the direction from which she came from.\u00a0\n\"Hey man, no need to be so-\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"What rude? Why shouldn't I, after what you did?\" Shinsou's eyes narrowed, glinting dangerously at Kaminari and his other two friends.\u00a0\n\"Listen, what should-\" Kirishima was the next one to fall under the purple haired teen's control, and just like Mina, Shinsou commanded the red haired teen to leave.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis left Sero and Kaminari alone with Hitoshi and Todoroki.\u00a0\nTsuyu already went ahead with Midoriya and brought him to his room.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"What the hell is up with you guys?! Just because you can't come to terms with the fact that Midoriya is the traitor doesn't mean you can use your quirk on our friend!\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"Midoriya is not the traitor\", Shouto calmly told them, but his eyes were burning with anger. \"Now I suggest you leave right now, or my face won't be the only one with a scar on it anymore.\"\n\u00a0\nScoffing in disbelief, Kaminari and Sero left but not before turning back to them one last time.\u00a0\n\" Don't come crying to us when you find out Midoriya really is the traitor. \"\n\u00a0\n\" We won't\", Shouto spoke without hesitation.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"Because he isn't. It's quite sad to think that people he loved and cherished are turning their backs on him because of some stupid rumor, isn't it?\" Hitoshi retorted, eyes flashing in cold amusement.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"But it was Aizawa-sensei who told us, and besides, everyone else thinks that as well! Don't you think it's strange how he always analyses our quirks and writes their weaknesses down? Or maybe that all that bone - breaking is for keeping up his good boy act?! \"\n\u00a0\n\" Sure, whatever you say \", Shinsou chuckled humorlessly and turned around, walking away.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe blonde and black haired boy both also went to go back to where Kirishima and Ashido were, but Todoroki stopped them.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\" One thing, Kaminari, Sero\", he said, turning around and smiling coldly, which seemed so wrong on the other's face.\n\u00a0\n\"Don't regret it when Midoriya won't ever trust you again.\"\n\u00a0\nAnd with that he turned around and left, not once looking back.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAizawa prided himself in being exceptionally observant.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDuring his younger years, some kids liked tormenting him after school, behind the building where no one saw, and to be sure none of them followed him on his way home, Shouta always tried keeping an eye out for them and dissappear before they had the chance to corner him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt had gradually morphed into a habit, an incredibly helpful one, might he add, especially for underground work where stealth and awareness of surroundings extremely mattered.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nChanges in the atmosphere, approaching presences, shifts in behavior, underlying character traits, signs of lies and deceive and possible fears, phobias and weaknesses.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe noticed everything.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEspecially when it came to his new class, full of energetic kids. They had potential, and Shouta made sure to keep an eye on anything that could help him assist them in becoming good heroes.\u00a0\nWhat better way to do that than by figuring out their habits and strength, as well as possible disadvantages caused by the nature of their quirk?\n\u00a0\nWhenever something was up with one of them, he knew right away.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n... and then he saw Midoriya's notebook and suddenly, he didn't know shit.\n\u00a0\nEssentially, he wasn't one to look through his student's stuff, because everyone was allowed some privacy and it really hadn't been any of Aizawa's business what they were doing in their free time, he was only there to provide help with hero studies after all.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n(That, of course, a blatant lie, he felt more like a babysitter or caretaker rather than a teacher taking care of his students..)\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nBut then there'd been the title of this notebook, and his interest had been caught.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\"Hero Analysis Notebook for the Future N\u00b0 15\"\n\n\u00a0\nWait... Number 15?\n\u00a0\n\nDid he have more of those books?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nLeast to say, he knew Midoriya was a little bit of a... weird kid. He was bright, there was no doubt, and selfless and kindhearted but also never listened to anything authorities told him.\u00a0\nShouta didn't mean to sound offensive, he knew nothing about the kid's past and didn't want to force him to talk, but whatever it was must have been at least the tiniest bit messed up.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd when he looked at the notebook, and realized that it was Midoriya's, aka. problem child's, he couldn't help but take a small look at what could be hidden inside.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHis face morphed from curiosity to shock, then horror.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs he looked through the notes, turning each page and skimming over the information provided on those, where different hero's quirks were broken down into different sections, such as strengths, weaknesses, advantages, disadvantages, weak points, how to best take them down, and how to improve the weak points, he almost felt sick.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis was what he was doing?!\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd oh god, there even were pages about his own classmates, friends, and various methods on how their quirk worked and so much more.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis was... a child had supposedly written this?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDear god what did he do with all this information?!\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe wasn't even sure trained analysts were able to provide a spectrum this bright on their opponents and all various tactics to disable them.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMidoriya... problem child... This was his student, but what the hell?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe turned the next page to come face to face with the smiling face of Uraraka in her hero costume, and as he read through the information, he didn't see a student analyzing their friend's and teacher's quirks to help them, he saw a dangerously intelligent person potentially selling that information to villains.\n\u00a0\n\nHow had he not seen it before?\n\n\u00a0\n\nHow could he let something like this slip from under his watchful eyes?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nHe'd mentioned before, Midoriya was a strange kid, and as much as he wanted to believe that all this bravery and hero-like behavior was genuine... what if it wasn't?\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nWhat if it was all a facade to make everyone trust him?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nHe always helped and helped and gave and gave and gave and\u2014\n\u00a0\nHow could he have been so stupid?!\n\u00a0\nThe first time they had a teachers' conference about there being a traitor in this school, Aizawa had wanted to deny it, because all of his students, whom he hadn't expelled, had potential to become great heroes. ((Let's not talk about Mineta though, because what the fuck was he thinking when letting this person pass?))\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFor God's sake, he had almost expelled Midoriya on his first day but didn't, because he deemed him worthy of being able to accomplish more and master bis quirk properly.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd now that he thought about it, wasn't it a bit suspicious that this kid has had so little control over their own quirk?\u00a0\n\u00a0\n'I should have expelled him...', Aizawa bitterly thought.\n\u00a0\nBut then again...maybe he was wrong and Midoriya wasn't the traitor....\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNo, the logically thinking part of his brain told him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhatever Midoriya was hiding, he should bring this case to Nedzu and discuss everything.\u00a0\nEither way, Izuku's chances of not being the traitor were slim, considering all this... evidence.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut he wouldn't judge yet, not until Nedzu told his opinion at least.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"Are you sure we should just assume it's him without even having any clues?\" Yamada carefully asked.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs much as he loved his bright husband, Aizawa was so close to just shaking some sense into the man. He was blinded by his fondness for Midoriya, that much was obvious.\n\u00a0\nEven All Might, who had a suspiciously good relationship with the green haired boy, agreed that he could be the traitor without a second thought.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"Nobody had a heart of gold, everyone hides bad secrets. I guess this is the boy's secret.\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNedzu nodded. \"I understand your hesitancy to believe what we are saying, Yamada-kun, but please consider it. This information is... should be more than simply classified, so how did he get hold of all this? And all things considered, I am quite concerned with what I read in this notebook, no matter his intentions with this.\"\n\u00a0\n\"And besides...\" the principal trailed off, an unreadable expression on his face as he tucked his paws under his chin, seemingly in thought.\u00a0\n\"What is it Nedzu-san?\" Aizawa asked, watching as said mammal shook his head slowly.\u00a0\n\"There'd been a hero who debuted not too long ago, her name was Black Lotus. She was killed during her second mission last week.\"\n\u00a0\nHe remembered, it had been a huge thing after all, broadcasted all over the news in Japan. A young heroine with a promising quirk dies at the hands of three villains.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut how did that fit in with what they talked about just now?\n\u00a0\n\"In Midoriya-kun's notebook, he analyzed this lady's quirk, and seeing as he wrote the date when finishing the given entry, it has come to my attention that the entry was finished on Wendesday, which was...\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"...two days before she died\", Shouta whispered in horror.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThat couldn't have been a coincidence, it was just...too convenient.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA pro hero debuted on Wednesday, with a big boom that would have made sure to skyrocket her popularity and probably even ensured her a place in the top twenty newcomer heroes, simply from the fact that at the right moment, there had been a villain with the right type of quirk, at the right place. Black Lotus' quirk had been meant for rescue work, naturally, since what it did was envelope people up to in a 50 m radius in a huge, shield-like black lotus. It looked like glass, the type you'd see on tinted car windows, but it was able to withstand even massive chunks of debris.\n\u00a0\nSurprisingly, there had been an incredibly destructive villain on the loose, who made more than just a few buildings fall. But thanks to Black Lotus, all citizens survived, unharmed and well.\u00a0\nShe had been able to show everyone the best way her quirk could be used, and by the time she had reached her limit, the villain had long been apprehended and everyone was bought to safety.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThen two days later she suddenly died during a fight with another villain, who had completely overpowered her and broke through the shield, even causing difficulties to other heroes that arrived at the scene and additionally killing over about eighty people.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA disaster.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n... So What other explanation was there, other than someone having given information about her quirk to villains?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMidoriya did an entry on her on the same day she debuted...\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt made too much sense...\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe whole situation with Midoriya was just too damn convenient...\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNedzu continued after that.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"I skimmed through this notebook before calling you. It has All Might's quirk broken down completely on more than ten pages, explaining every little detail, including his injury, how it affected him, his weaknesses, fighting style, everything. This analysis goes far beyond just quirk studies, even if All Might would have told the boy about everything. Midoriya-kun searches for possible weaknesses everywhere, even going as far as personality-wise to make sure everything could be used against them.\"\n\u00a0\n\"B-But\", Present Mic tried to argue, and Eraserhead was sure his hair started flowing at some point because one glance at him and Yamada shut up, though the look on his face clearly told Shouta that he didn't believe them.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"Yamada-kun, I want you to understand\", Nedzu sighed. \" This boy has analyzed the former number one hero's quirk in such detail I wouldn't even have been able to. Half of the information is based off of different websites with links to those sites and by the looks of it, they were more than a year old. Midoriya wrote down the date when he finished this analysis, which was roughly a few days before the entrance exam.\"\n\u00a0\nMidnight and Snipe stiffened at the implication.\u00a0\n\" And on the second day of the new school year, the League of Villains attacked USJ with the goal of killing All Might. This couldn't have been done without them knowing in detail how his fight with All For One affected him and what his exact time limit would be.\"\n\u00a0\n\"It makes sense\", Midnight chimed in. \"When the heroes arrived at the scene and the League of Villains left, All Might was in need of Cementoss making a barrier so that no one would see him in his weak form. They came to USJ knowing that his public form wouldn't hold for much longer.\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAt that, Aizawa's glare only intensified as he looked at the notebook that was in his hands. USJ has brought some lasting damage to him as well, with Shigaraki almost killing him and the Noumu having beaten him into the ground, it was why the thought of one if his student helping cause all of that made Aizawa seethe.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"Fuck this all!\" Hizashi shouted as he slammed his fists onto the table of the conference room, making Shouta look at him with wide eyes. Never had he seen his husband look anything even remotely close to how he looked right now.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHis eyes were glowing in fury, his face was scrunched up in anger he had never seen on the man before and his whole body was shaking.\u00a0\n\"This boy, this child, is the purest and kindest soul I have ever had the pleasure of having as a student. He is bright, optimistic, hardworking and selfless, and you want to tell me he is supposed to be the infamous traitor?!\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"Zashi listen-\" Aizawa tried but was immediately cut off.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"BULLSHIT!\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEveryone in the room, even Nedzu and All Might flinched at that. Yamada promptly walked up to the door before turning his head one last time and leveling them with a hard glare to the ground.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"I will not tolerate you thinking like that about him, colleagues, principal, or whatever! I'm going to tell him what you think and he'll prove to yo\u2014\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"Yamada-kun\", Nedzu\u00a0 interrupted sternly, having gained his composure after the unexpected outburst.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"I understand that it is hard to believe... and I hope it will not come to this... but you are aware that if you tell Midoriya about this, it will be counted as aiding a possible suspect, and thus, will have your license revoked...\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe blond haired man stared at Nedzu in disbelief.\u00a0\n\" Are you threatening me?\"\n\u00a0\n\" No no, of course not, I wouldn't dare do something like that... but you understand that given the circumstances... your behavior will seem, how do I say... suspicious, and we wouldn't want to cause unnecessary trouble for U.A., wouldn't we?\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYamada chuckled coldly and Eraserhead felt a shiver run down his spine at the behavior.\u00a0\n\" Fine, Nedzu-san, have it your way. But don't come running back to him when the truth will come to light. \"\n\u00a0\nHe eyed all of them, turned to Aizawa and when their eyes met, it seemed as if the blonde man stared straight through the black haired male's soul, and not just at him.\n\u00a0\nHe abruptly turned around and slammed the door, leaving Aizawa and everyone else alone.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe next day, when Midoriya came into class, Aizawa glared at the boy, observing his behavior, what he did, anything that could help in finding out if he was the traitor, but nothing seemed out of the ordinary.\n\u00a0\n'Of course', the black haired male thought.'If he really is the traitor, he should be good at hiding the traits that would give it away. And this boy is damn good at keeping everything to himself.'\n\u00a0\nAizawa thought the whole evening about how to get any clues on the case, pacing back and forth in his and Present Mic's apartment.\nHis husband hadn't been home since the conference, most likely staying somewhere nobody would look for him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey hadn't even talked after yesterday...\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTruth to be told, he did understand why Yamada would refuse to believe Nedzu and everyone else. Midoriya looked like an optimistic, bright and selfless kid, therefore it wasn't such a wonder Hizashi had taken a liking to him.\u00a0\nThey were pretty similar in character.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut he had to understand.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs much as he didn't like the idea of this one kid being a villain, they had to include all options and outcomes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd if it meant suspecting and arresting Midoriya, then they would do so.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe next few weeks were hard.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNot just physically, but emotionally as well.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAizawa tried to stay strong, but whenever they would see each other at school, Present Mic would completely ignore him and walk right past the black haired man.\u00a0\nHe hasn't come home even once, hasn't answered any of his texts and calls and wouldn't even as much as smile at the staff.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNot to mention the additional stress surrounding the topic of when to arrest the boy and how.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n... Midoriya was a whole other case.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhile Aizawa informed the class of the staff's suspicion, and he himself remained cold and indifferent to all of Midoriya's kind behavior, he noticed some changes after the first week.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe first thing were the looks.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIzuku had looked at him sometimes during the lesson, or when they would accidently see each other in the hallways, and always, always did the green haired boy look at him with big, helpless and sad eyes, before averting his gaze immediately and looking at the floor, or table, depending on the situation.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd when the second week came by, he stopped looking at him altogether.\u00a0\nIt shouldn't have affected him the way it did, because Midoriya was most likely the traitor, he didn't deserve any kindness, but when he compared Midoriya before he found the notebook and the whole dilemma began - sitting proudly and happy in his seat - with the boy he saw in class now - hunched in on himself, eyes glued to his desk, posture tense as if awaiting a blow - he couldn't believe this was the same person.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd it shouldn't have affected him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut he felt his heart ache.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe longer he observed Midoriya, the more he noticed all the changes that happened in the weeks now.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhenever he saw him, his notebook was nowhere to be seen.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHis classmates also said that they haven't seen that book for a long time now.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe stopped mumbling too.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBy now, hearing Izuku mumbling during class while teaching had become natural, Aizawa would even go as far as to say that he could actually relax to it. He never really listened into what the boy was mumbling, but it just...\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt was there. Since their first day.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd then it wasn't.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe only sound that could be heard was the clock ticking, nothing else, an unnerving silence filling the room.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAt first he looked completely dumbfounded, about to turn around to face his class and ask them where the boy was, but then he saw him in his seat.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe was looking down on his desk, pen hovering over the paper but not actually writing anything. His posture was tense, looking ready to flee at any moment and his mouth most certainly wasn't forming a storm of muttered words.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt was weird, and different, but he had shrugged it off, thinking it was a onetime thing, that tomorrow it would go back to the way it used to be.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut then it didn't.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAfter that day, he simply... stopped.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe started questioning himself, 'What if Midoriya isn't the traitor?'\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBecause despite the convenience of the situation, the evidence and the fact that all of it fit together like a puzzle, he had never seen or heard him do or say anything that would be a cause for suspicion. Of course the whole point of being a traitor is to be able to slip on a mask of innocence, but not even Midoriya could be able to act this good.... could he?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe cause of this thought sprouting in his head was Midoriya's conversation with Present Mic that he overheard.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\"Oh, uhm, Yamada-san! D-Do you have a little bit of time right now?\" Aizawa immediately stopped and hid around the corner as he recognized the voice.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Sure thing, little listener! What's up?\" Present Mic cheerfully retorted.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"O-Oh uhm, it's just...\" He heard a zipping sound, maybe a bagpack being opened, then some shuffling, and then the zip being closed again.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"I have an entry on you in my hero analysis notebook, a new one I added because I put some additional notes to the original ones and w-well... I wanted to ask if you could, maybe, look through them and tell me what you think?\"\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAizawa froze.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWeren't those notebooks supposed to be classified information? Why did he want to show it to a teacher?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\" Sure thing little listener! I heard you have quite the talent in analyzing!\" he heard Hizashi's voice , but Shouta already stepped away and went to inform Nedzu of what he heard.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nWhy would he...?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHad he been wrong after all...?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGoing to Nedzu didn't change anything in the end.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n'He could have shown it in hopes of Yamada-kun correcting and adding even more details, which would give the League of Villains an even bigger advantage, given that all this information had come from an original source', the principal had said, and shit, that made sense too.\u00a0\nFor all they knew, it could have also been incomplete, so as not to raise any suspicion about the amount of details.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAizawa was conflicted, wasn't so sure about that anymore, but didn't try to stop them.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNow that he thought about it, he should have...\n\u00a0\nThe third week came around quickly and Nedzu had planned to take Midoriya to interrogate him after his lesson with Hizashi, much to the blonde's dismay.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe had protested against it, saying he would never let the boy be taken as long as he was there, but he couldn't do anything against the principal.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAizawa had a bad feeling about it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAll Might was already at the police station too, Nedzu and Sir Nighteye as well.\u00a0\n\"I told you choosing this boy was a mistake\", he heard the former sidekick say in a cold voice, but he payed little attention to what they were talking about.\u00a0\nInstead he was focusing on what would happen in a bit.\u00a0\nMidoriya was going to be brought here, interrogated and most likely, as Nedzu said, locked in a cell where it would get revealed that he was, indeed, the traitor.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut he wasn't so sure anymore, and it made him nervous.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIf they were wrong about their suspicion, the outcome... would be catastrophic.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHis initial panic and anger and fear had passed after some time, when observing the changes in Midoriya's behavior, his habits, posture, gestures and the way he acted around others, and by no means, did that look like a possible traitor.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMidoriya's notebook had been with him during the whole time, and when rereading it again to try and see how exactly they had come to the conclusion that he was the traitor based on a single notebook, but he couldn't.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe book was detailed, yes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe had a whole lot of information in it, yes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA horrific amount of possible weaknesses were described in them, yes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut then again... There were just as many ways to avoid those weaknesses written there.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEraserhead read and re-read the book again and again, trying to see what everyone, including him in the beginning, saw so dangerous, but he couldn't.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe saw immense potential in the boy as an analyst and strategist, with how detailed those notes were.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut it was too late to turn back now.\u00a0\nThere was still a chance he might be the traitor, and Nedzu seemed to believe that fullheartedly.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo he let it be.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt was quiet for some time, everyone waiting with baited breath for the police officers to arrive with the green haired boy, and when they finally did, it was a total chaos.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe boy wasn't given a chance to look around, he was bluntly forced to sit on the chair in the interrogation room and then the door was closed, leaving him with a police officer.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe wanted to look, wanted to see if there would be some changes in the boy's behavior, if he would admit to being the traitor or not but... He couldn't.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe felt his students eyes on him through the glass, and all he did was clench his own shut and look away.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe didn't think he could handle the boy's expression.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd then the eyes dissappeared.\u00a0\nAizawa looked up slowly and saw the boy looking at the table with tears in his eyes as the officer began the interrogation, screaming questions at him without giving Midoriya a chance to reply.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt wasn't pleasant to watch at all.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe screaming went on for about two hours, with Midoriya breaking down into heart wrenching sobs and crying whilst still denying everything, then suddenly stopped moving or doing anything, appearing almost as if catatonic.\u00a0\nThe only indication that the boy was still conscious where the tears streaming down his dull eyes and the subconscious answers he gave, still denying everything.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"This-This is getting us nowhere!\" Shouta finally spoke up, trying to get the screaming to stop.\n\u00a0\nAt that exact moment, he saw Tsukauchi enter the police station, looking absolutely furious.\u00a0\nThe underground hero gulped, and only now did Nedzu and everyone else noticed the arrival of the detective.\n\u00a0\nFuck, how could they have forgotten about the detective who had a literal truth quirk?!\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"Tsukauchi-kun-\" Nedzu turned to look at the man but was promptly cut off.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"What is this?\" his voice was stone cold, it was impossible to make out what he was thinking, but it definitely wasn't anything pleasing.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJust as All Might stepped forward, trying to explain himself, Naomasa opened his mouth again.\u00a0\n\"You don't have the right to lock this child in here without his parents agreeing to this, do you understand? You didn't have a single right to let him get interrogated for-\" he checked his wristwatch,\"two hours.\"\n\u00a0\nSir Nighteye turned to the detective.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"No, you keep your mouth shut! I am the specialist here, with a truth quirk, who knows how all this works, not you!\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe came closer and stood directly in front of Toshinori, glaring at him with all his might, but the words were meant for everyone in this room here.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\" If Yamada hadn't called me, would you have even thought of calling me instead of screaming answers out of him? He is a child, for god's sake! You do not have the right to treat him as you would treat a criminal, a real villain!\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe sighed and turned to the door, about to open it.\" I do not know all the details, but I do know that if you have damaged this child in any way by this bullshit you caused, I will personally hand over all information I know about all of you to the League of Villains. And did you forget about who exactly Midoriya-kun is? Specifically, who he is to Eri? \"\n\u00a0\n\" She will be seething once she finds out what professional heroes did to the person who risked his life to save her, the person who was her hero. \"\n\u00a0\nAnd then he was inside the room, having kicked out the police officer who had still been screaming at the boy.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAizawa felt his stomach drop.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSeeing Tsukauchi like this...he couldn't say much except that he believed him wholeheartedly.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut why was the man so sure the boy wasn't a traitor? Hadn't he considered the possibility?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShouta watched the man ask Izuku the same questions but calmer and more composed, a kindness in his voice that hadn't been there before.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd then, they were finished.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJust like that.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAizawa blinked and Tsukauchi was standing in front of him. Lips pressed together in a thin line and eyes glowing with restrained fury.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"I hope you are happy with what you've done\", he said and handed Aizawa the paper containing the crosses the detective made for every true answer.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs he skimmed over the paper, all breath left his lungs and his eyes widened.\u00a0\n'Oh my god', he thought as he realised what the detective meant.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\" Aizawa-kun, what is it?\" Nedzu asked beside him, and all he did was hand over the papers, completely numb to his surroundings.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"We were wrong.\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSinking to his knees, Aizawa grabbed a fistful of his hair and clenched his eyes shut.\u00a0\n'What have I done.... What have I done to my student...'\n\u00a0\nHe heard Nedzu talk, the police officer, Sir Nighteye and All Might were also saying something, but he couldn't make out any coherent words, the voices in his own head too loud.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"IZUKU!\"\n\u00a0\nLooking up in shock, Shouta saw Shinsou and Todoroki come closer to them, a panicked expression on both their faces.\u00a0\nHe realised with a start that Izuku left the interrogation room and was standing with his head down, shaking slightly.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThen his knees buckled and Aizawa made a move to reach out to the boy, to support his weight, do anything to to make this right.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShinsou and Todoroki reached him before he himself did.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAizawa knew there was no making this right. He failed his student, plain and simple. He failed him in all the possible ways he could fail a child and there was no sugarcoating it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWatching with a pained expression on his face as the purple haired teen wrapped his arms around Izuku before both sank to the floor, Todoroki following down with a hand on the green haired boy's back.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEraserhead heard the boy sob into his friend's shoulder, hands itching to do something to make it stop - he had already caused Midoriya enough tears-, before he just... stopped.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt was completely abrupt, because all of a sudden, the tears stopped and what remained were the trembles in his body.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n'He most likely doesn't have any tears left to cry...', the black haired male realised bitterly, thinking back to how he had broken down in that room. They really fucked up.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey fucked up beyond words.... Gulping to get the knot in his throat to lessen, he remembered his husband's words, saying not to regret it now.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOh how he wished he could have turned back time to make everything right again.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThen they wouldn't be here, they would be in class, Midoriya's mumbling accompanying Aizawa's own words, no tension in the atmosphere whatsoever.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd oh shit.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe class.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n'Fuuuuck', Aizawa ruffled his hair and almost let out a scream when he thought about it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHow would his class react to him not being the traitor?\u00a0\nHe had seen how distant they'd become with Midoriya, if anything, they would feel worse than dirt upon realising that blindly trusting their teachers led to something as devastating as that.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen he heard shuffling, Shouta watched as Hitoshi and Izuku rose to their feet, ready to leave.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe couldn't.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey couldn't leave.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe had to tell the boy sorry, it wasn't going to fix anything, but he had to know that Aizawa regretted it, he regretted it so fucking much.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTaking a step forward, Aizawa reached out with his hand. \"M-Midori-\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"DON'T TOUCH HIM!\" Hitoshi screamed.\n\u00a0\n\"Don't any of you dare come any closer to him!\"\n\u00a0\nImmediately ceasing his movements, Aizawa flinched back at the looks of pure hatred he received.\u00a0\nRealising that he had not only lost the trust of his green haired student, but also the purple haired boy and half hot half cold quirk user, Shouta tried talking to them.\n\u00a0\n\"Listen-\"\n\u00a0\nIn less than a second, the floor was covered in ice and all the police officers and teachers were stuck in it.\n\"If any of you ever dare come any closer to him, you'll see who real villains are.\"\n\u00a0\nTodoroki leveled them with a glare colder than his ice, hostile and unforgiving, before the kids turned on their heels and started walking away towards the entrance of the police station.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAmd Aizawa could do nothing more but watch them go, his feet stuck in the ice, hands itching run after the green haired boy and pull him into a hug, apologizing for every way he had failed the boy.\u00a0\n'Oh god, what have I done... What have I done...'\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWalking towards the teacher's lounge felt like walking towards death itself, his heart cold and heavy, the guilt and shame of what he'd done weighing him down.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe was an idiot, an egoistic asshole who disregarded the trust his student had in him just because of a notebook.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA notebook that showed a young boy, who was terrified of his friends and teachers dying, analyzing quirks and writing possible improvements.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nWhy couldn't he have thought before acting so brash?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhy couldn't he have put aside his suspicion for the sake of giving Izuku a reason to trust him?!\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nAizawa choked a sob, not bothering to wipe the tears streaming down his face as he saw the teacher's lounge come into view.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nWhy couldn't he have been the teacher Izuku deserved? Instead of cherishing the boy's trust, he obliterated all of the pieces he shattered in the first place.\n\n\u00a0\nHe was never going to trust again.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe won't ever feel safe again at U.A.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe won't ever bother him with a problem, just because he'd think Aizawa couldn't listen.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nHe would never feel safe around his classmates again.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n...\n\u00a0\n\nWhat have I done indeed...\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nIt was quiet in the hallway, reminding Aizawa of the quiet before the storm as he stood directly in front of the teacher's lounge.\u00a0\nHe looked horrible no doubt, but he could care less.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe had failed his student.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe had failed a child.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nHe had failed, failed in every way possible, failed with no hope left to repair what he'd done, failed so\u2014\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe pushed open the door and entered, feeling all eyes immediately turn to him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"Shouta! How did it go?\" Midnight was the first to speak up, wondering if the boy had been arrested yet.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut then she looked closer at her friend's appearance. Disheveled hair, tear tracks on his cheeks, eyes glued to the floor, and she knew right away that something bad had happened.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\" Aizawa, what happened?\" Cementoss asked worriedly, everyone else shuffling closer too.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe black haired male sighed and and looked up with regretful and pained black eyes trained on every single one of them.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"Midoriya is innocent, he's not the traitor.\"\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEvery and all noise ceased in the room.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt got so quiet you could hear a pin drop, everyone frozen in their places.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe news delivered were like a bomb being dropped, and everyone was sure they didn't hear right.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"S-Sorry Shouta, come ag-again?\"Midnight mumbled, face rapidly draining of any color as she stumbled back at the words.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\" Midoriya.... we failed him. He's not U.A.'s traitor. \"\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt was completely quiet in the teacher's lounge.\nEveryone was frozen in place as if catatonic upon hearing Aizawa repeat himself.\n\u00a0\nThe silence was only broken by the sound of someone choke on a sob, and even that was abruptly interrupted by the door being slammed open.\n\u00a0\nAizawa was afraid to turn around, he was terrified of seeing the person's expression, because without knowing who actually just threw open the door, he knew it was his husband.\n\u00a0\nAnd he was proven right, when Midnight painfully stiffened when she saw the person behind him, and everyone else in the room tensed as well, as if expecting the blonde hero to explode on them and go haywire.\n\u00a0\nWith his rather loud personality and repeated conflict because of his unwavering trust in Midoriya, Shouta wouldn't have been surprised if Yamada started shouting at them, activating his quirk on purpose just so the words would be painfully clearer to understand.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStillness was what they were met with instead.\n\u00a0\nSlowly, afraid of looking, Aizawa dared cast a glance at Yamada, but the moment he did, flinched back as if burned.\n\u00a0\nBecause the man's expression was blank, horrifyingly blank, and his eyes were two cold chips of ice, piercing right through his heart.\n\u00a0\nHe looked like a soulless doll.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n'What heart', he heard himself question in the back of his head. 'If I managed to interrogate and accuse my student of something he wasn't, I truly am a heartless asshole.'\n\u00a0\nEvery single person in the room was expecting something to happen, waiting for any kind of reaction, but nothing came.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThose two dead eyes merely casted a glance at the people in the room, before turning away and paying them no further mind.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSomehow, that felt worse than it'd have if Yamada actually leveled them to the ground with a nasty glare. Or better yet, six feet underground.\n\u00a0\nEveryone watched mutely as Hizashi's ghostly quiet form seemingly floated over to his desk, grabbing his bag and returning towards the door.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt was only then, right when he was about to leave, that Yamada finally spoke up.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd then Aizawa wished he had just left quietly without even acknowledging any of them any further.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"I hope you rot in hell\", was all they heard before walking out, the words muttered with a voice matching his lifeless appearance, the door falling shut on it's own.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEveryone had flinched at the words, hard, and it took a long while before Midnight cleared her throat.\u00a0\n\"He-.... He's not the...traitor....?\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShe was still in denial of the revelation.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJust like many others, she had adored Izuku, seeing as he was such a kind and attentive boy, but then she heard the possibility of him being the traitor and, it made so much sense to her at the time, she regarded her student as nothing more than a threat. Kayama didn't even think to question herself, or look, really look at Midoriya and the way he had changed in the past weeks.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd now she heard her friend, one of her longest and closest friends, getting across the message that 'Bitch, you fucked up' in a kindly wrapped package called 'he's innocent'.\n\u00a0\nShe couldn't come to terms with this.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShe failed her student, not only in the responsibly and care like way, but in the usual business teacher student way.\u00a0\nThe thought of him being the traitor and the abject horror she felt at the time were enough to fail her best student.\u00a0\nShe had given him zero points in the assignment for god's sake!\u00a0\nShe had failed him in the test and look where that got her.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEveryone else felt that way too, especially the heroes that had direct contact to Midoriya in terms of teaching his class.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"What now?\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt was Ectoplasm who asked.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut Aizawa could do nothing more than merely shake his head.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"I don't know\", he whispered, and that was the full truth.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe didn't know.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe truly didn't know how to make this right.\n\u00a0\nEveryone lowered their gaze, and no more words followed.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThen suddenly, he heard fast footsteps coming the teacher lounge's way, and the door was thrown open a second time.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOnly that it wasn't another teacher or hero.\n\u00a0\nIt was Mirio.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"Aizawa-san, I'm so sorry for intruding, but I couldn't find anyone willing to explain to me for the last three hours why Midoriya-kun was dragged into a police car by a bunch of officers?! \"\n\u00a0\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n...shit.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSir Nighteye, Nedzu and All Might were sitting in one of the rooms the police had offered them, not speaking a word.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBoth Mirai and Nedzu had guilt ridden expressions on their faces, but strangely enough, All Might didn't really seem affected by it.\n\u00a0\n\"I'm giving up my hero license\", Sir Nighteye suddenly said, having taken off his glasses to rub his eyes just a few moments prior.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"Mirai-kun-\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"Don't!\", he raised his voice, but instantly calmed himself and sighed tiredly.\u00a0\n\"I was supposed to see he was innocent, I've had him under my wing for some time after all, and even if we started at the wrong foot, even I couldn't deny that he had what it took to become a good hero. Especially after he saved my life, I should have put more trust in him, not let everyone's suspicion cloud my mind .\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEven Nedzu couldn't say anything against that. He personally knew the boy had gotten his quirk from All Might, knew the lengths the boy would go to to save his friends, and yet when holding the notebook in his hands, carefully turning each page, his fear of the detailed descriptions causing his vision to tunnel.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAll Might had told him that he had told Midoriya about the origin of his quirk that time when the sludge villain attacked, which had been roughly ten months before the entrance exam.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut Midoriya's notes on Toshinori's quirk were at least a year old, which was before he ever met the man, and that led to him thinking that he was incredibly smart, incredibly skilled in analyzing, and incredibly dangerous.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe additional notes and the whole entry itself had been finished way after the two met, but those little parts weren't as important as the actual analysis. And blinded by fear for his students, he had jumped to conclusions.\n\u00a0\nConclusions he didn't know how to make right again.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd on top of that, there was the incident with Black Lotus, which he still couldn't explain, but to blame it on someone who could have helped the young deceased hero strengthen her weaknesses was foolish.\n\u00a0\nIn order to try and save a school, he had failed a student in all ways possible, had betrayed his trust and completely obliterated the meaning of what made a good principal.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCasting a careful glance sideways, Nedzu wondered if All Might felt worse than he himself did.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe probably did.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWell, theoretically he should, but the look in his eyes seemed to imply otherwise, and the principal couldn't understand why.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWasn't Midoriya important to him?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd yet right now, it didn't seem like it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nToshinori was calm, sitting with his gaze on the wall opposite to them, looking as if he didn't have a single care in the world and couldn't be bothered by the fact that he had suspected his own prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\n\u00a0\n\"Toshinori-kun, aren't you... worried? About what will happen now?\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAll Might didn't give any reaction to that, still looking strangely at peace, as if he didn't understand the consequences of his actions.\n\u00a0\nThen he slowly turned his head to Nedzu.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"Why?\", he asked. \"What happened has happened, and if Midoriya isn't the traitor then he's not. We have done what was necessary after all, he doesn't have a reason to be upset about it.\"\n\u00a0\n\"But All Might\", Mirai interjected, shocked at what he was hearing. \"Midoriya is your successor, how can you not feel guilty about suspecting him?\"\n\u00a0\nYagi's gaze drifted to his former sidekick's, making the other flinch back a little at the almost bored expression on his face. \" I'm afraid I fail to see what is so grave about that. It is because he is my successor that it doesn't matter.\"\n\u00a0\n\"How can you say that?!\" Sir Nighteye shouted, anger and disbelief seeping into his voice. \"We are talking about Midoriya, your boy, your prot\u00e9g\u00e9, your\u2014\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"That's right\", the former number one hero interjected. \"He's my prot\u00e9g\u00e9, nothing more nothing less. I have seen potential in him as the next wielder of One for All, I don't care about him as a person.\"\n\u00a0\nSasaki and Nedzu felt as if they'd been dropped into cold water.\n\u00a0\n... what?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe didn't... care?\n\u00a0\n\"Then why did you give your quirk to him and not Mirio?\" Sir Nighteye asked weakly, mortified at the man's words.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe remembered the smile on his face when talking to Izuku, remembered those green eyes full of admiration and gratefulness staring back at him and laughing warmly. He remembered All Might storming into the hospital to see the other, asking if his boy was alright.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd now he suddenly didn't care anymore?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHad his worry even been real?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHave his smiles been genuine?\n\u00a0\nSir Nighteye knew that his first impression towards Izuku had been anything but pleasant, but after the huge chaos surrounding Overhaul, he had seen that the boy a heart of gold.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd still, that hadn't been enough to defend Midoriya from the avcusation of him being a traitor, worse yet, Sasaki agreed with them after seeing the notebook.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd now that it was proven he was innocent, Mirai felt more like a failure than ever before.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd hearing All Might, the hero he had so much respect of, talk about Midoriya as if it was okay to force him into a police car with handcuffs and interrogate him for about three hours, did not only fuel his anger at the other man, but his guilt too.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMidoriya... didn't deserve any of that.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey really... only caused more damage than did good to protect the rest of the students..\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"I had assumed you already knew, both of you. Since my quirk would cause my successor to break their bones, it was better to choose a boy I don't know instead of your intern.\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSasaki felt sick.\n\u00a0\nTaking a shuddering breath, he clenched the fabric of his pants tightly between his fists.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\" What about your behavior then? \", he whispered.\" What about your worry and your smiles and fear of something happening to him?\"\n\u00a0\n\" That kid looks at me like I hung the stars. I needed someone to inherit One for All so it wouldn't lose its power, and as long as I keep my public appearance up around him, he'll do as I say. \"\n\u00a0\nSir Nighteye inhaled sharply, blinking his tears away and abruptly stood up, leaving the room without another word.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe mammal sighed and lowered his gaze to the floor, moving to stand up as well.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe was disappointed.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFor all that he should have been able to predict this outcome, what had just been said shocked even him. He was a genius, had an abnormally high IQ, and yet he felt like an utter fool. He would have never expected...\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\" As much as I respected you, Toshinori-kun, I am questioning your ability to teach my students if you think of Midoriya as nothing more but a puppet to play with as you'd like.\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWith those words he left as well, leaving All Might alone in the room.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAizawa sighed as he observed the room. After Togata barged into the teacher's lounge like he did and asked that question, the underground hero had taken him into an empty classroom to explain everything.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMirio's expression was ranged from worry and anxiousness to anger, and Aizawa knew that if he told him everything now, it would be the last time the third year ever looked at him with respect.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut the damage has been done and to take the first step into making everything right, he had to face the wrath of Midoriya's senpai.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"Aizawa-san, please, can you tell me what happened? I texted him about a hundred times but he hasn't even answered to any messages yet and nobody else was willing to say anything.\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShouta looked down and rubbed his face with his hand.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"Mirio... What happened was a horrible mistake everyone, including me, made.\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"W-What do you mean?\" he asked, not really following what the teacher was saying.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA mistake?\n\u00a0\nA mistake that included getting Midoriya handcuffed?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWas he...handcuffed by mistake?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut that was ridiculous! And in front of the whole school on top of that!\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo maybe he had been mistaken for someone?\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"It was supposed to be a secret due to our... uncertainty on that matter, and only the teachers and Midoriya's class have been informed of our suspicion.\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"What suspicion?\" Mirio asked, expression darkening a bit. Aizawa was talking around the bush, and it didn't take an idiot to see that he was guilty.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"... we weren't really sure about it, but after all the villain attacks on my class this year, there had been suspicions of a traitor being in U.A...\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTogata didn't need any more words to understand where this was going, and with growing horror he pieced everything together.\" No... \"\n\u00a0\nHe desperately hoped that it wasn't what he thought it was, but when Aizawa shut his eyes, he knew.\" I found one of Midoriya's notebooks about hero analysis, which were incredibly detailed, and-\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"\u2014you jumped to conclusions\", the blonde third year murmured.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAizawa could do no more than hang his head in shame. \"We did.\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"And what about sir? Or All Might?\" Togata suddenly remembered, knowing for sure that those two must have tried defending his friend. Furthermore, how stupid and blind must those have been who believed Izuku was the traitor?! He was such a precious child, had a heart of gold, and selfless wasn't enough to describe his actions. He was a real hero, so why...\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAizawa paled.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFuck.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe forgot how close Sir Nighteye and Mirio were, and All Might... he must have known that him and Izuku were close...\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhat was he supposed to say now?\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n... apparently nothing, because the silence he gave in response was enough, and yet... Mirio couldn't believe that Sir would believe such bullshit.\u00a0\nThe man had seen how heroic and selfless Izuku was, hell, the boy had played a major part in the Shie Haissaki raid, even was the one to completely destroy Overhaul, and after all he'd done...\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHis heart went out to his kouhai.\u00a0\nNo doubt did the whole case take a big toll on him. Mirio himself didn't know how he'd be able to live with the fact that people he was supposed to trust back stabbed him like that.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n'No wonder he wasn't answering me...'\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAfter this, the only thing he could do was be there for the green haired boy and hope that everything would turn out alright...\u00a0\n\u00a0\nExhaling shakily, Mirio turned on his heels and made his way over to the door.\n\u00a0\n\"I...didn't expect U.A. to be like that, sir. And I didn't expect a highly respected person in Midoriya's eyes, such as yourself, to be blinded by whatever it was that made everyone jump to this conclusion. You of all people should have known that he would never do such a thing.\"\n\u00a0\nThen he was gone and Aizawa was left alone yet again.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n'Highly respected in Midoriya's eyes... '\n\u00a0\nHis eyes watered.\n\u00a0\n\"Shit...\"\n\u00a0\nMirio's words were like a punch in the gut.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe had known that the two of them had become good friends, and even if the third year's reaction was more than justified, he couldn't help but wonder... if Mirio, who hadn't known about any of this, reacted in such way, then what would his class say, who had shunned him after the teachers told them of their suspicion?\n\u00a0\nHe didn't want to know.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe pulled out his phone anyway and texted Iida.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAizawa:\nTell everyone to gather in 1-A's classroom\n\u00a0\nHe was about to send the message, but remembered Shinsou and Todoroki, and their reaction when they both came to the police station. No doubt where they with Izuku now, and since the two where the only ones, along with Tsuyu, who hadn't distanced themselves from him, it would be better if they stayed with the green haired boy. After all, they would already be in the known about the outcome.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAizawa :\nExcept for Midoriya, Todoroki, Asui and Shinsou\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n'...'\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAizawa:\nPlease\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMostly everyone from Class 1-A was gathered in the common room when Iida got a message from their homeroom teacher.\n\u00a0\n\"Everyone, Aizawa-sensei told me to gather everyone in our classroom, so please bring Bakugou, Shouji and Aoyama and proceed to follow our teacher's instructions.\"\n\u00a0\n\"Did he say why?\" Ashido questioned, having just come from the kitchen with a cup of juice in her hand.\nThe blue head shook his head, and Yaomomo spoke up.\n\"Midoriya has been brought into the interrogation room, no? Maybe it's news about what happened?\"\n\u00a0\n\"Do you think he'll get arrested?\" Hagakure spoke up, but Kirishima shook his head, an unusual expression of guilt on his face.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"I saw him earlier with Todoroki and Shinsou, they went upstairs.\"\n\u00a0\n\"Hm, I guess we'll find out about what's going on in a bit anyway\", Kaminari commented, standing next to Sero as the two already made their way to the front door. However, Uraraka's question made them pause.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"Guys... What if Deku's not the traitor? Do you think he'd be upstairs if he was the traitor? \" she questioned, having a bad feeling about everything.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAfter the teachers told them about the possibility of him being the traitor, she didn't want to believe it at first. Iida and her both thought it was ridiculous, but when she herself got a glimpse of the notebook he was writing in, she was overcome by fearby the entry on her.\u00a0\nA whole page was dedicated to the fact that people needed to break her hands if they want her quirk to be disabled and that she could only use her quirk with her hands.\u00a0\nIt had terrified her to the point where she also started believing that maybe he was a traitor, that maybe he sold that information to villains.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut now she had her doubts again, and even if the bigger part of her brain told her that she shouldn't trust him so easily, she couldn't help but include the possibility of Midoriya being innocent.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut if he was....she couldn't dare even think of what would happen.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"Don't be stupid Uraraka!\" Mina exclaimed loudly, though there was something akin to nervousness in her tone.\u00a0\n\"Everyone thought so, even the principal himself! And I don't think that our teachers would be wrong about something like that\", she added the last part, thoroughly convinced that if pro heroes believed it, she had to believe too.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"Let's just go guys\", Kirishima dragged down a furious Bakugou, who had become even more hostile towards everyone, especially Kirishima, over the past weeks.\u00a0\n\"Come on Bakubro just calm down!\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"Shut the fuck up you extra!\", he snarled and ripped his arm from the red head's hold, being the first one to leave through the door towards the school.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKirishima couldn't blame him...he would have acted the same way in Bakugou's place.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEveryone else followed suite, but the feeling of uneasiness only grew the closer they got.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen everyone sat down on their respective seats, they noticed the absence of three of their classmates.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"Has anyone seen Shinsou, Asui and Todoroki? Why didn't anyone call them too?\" Yaomomo questioned, pointing to the three empty seats.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"My apologies, Aizawa stated that Shinsou, Asui and Todoroki were not to be included in this meeting\", Iida answered, and right at this moment, their homeroom teacher entered the room.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe atmosphere got heavy and suffocating, and nobody commented on how Aizawa looked worse than they'd ever seen him. They could clearly see that he'd been crying, and he looked like he'd aged about seven years in just a day, feeling that a small wind could knock him down.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"Thank you for calling everyone on such short notice\", Shouta sent a nod Iida's way, who only bowed his head and said that it was his duty as the class president.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"Pardon, but why are we here Monsieur Aizawa? And why aren't Shinsou-kun, Asui-chan and Todoroki-kun here too?\" Aoyama asked in confusion, and only got a sigh in response.\u00a0\nThat was when everyone noticed the extent of how wrong everything seemed.\u00a0\nAizawa sounded utterly defeated, ashamed even, and they didn't know why.\u00a0\n\" Shinsou and Todoroki are with Midoriya at the moment\", he finally answered, but couldn't bring himself to lift his head, afraid of seeing their reaction to the news he's going to drop in a few moments.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"Wasn't Midoriya arrested?\" Kouda asked what everyone had been thinking. Even after Kirishima said he'd seen him back at the dorms, they thought that he got arrested quietly so no one would see.\u00a0\nMaybe that was why they were called here..\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"Class\", the black haired male exhaled shakily. \"Midoriya... is not the traitor.\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSilence.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt was as if everyone had stopped breathing altogether, and he was sure that he could hear the sound of a fly in the room.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAt least until a small explosion rang through the whole classroom.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"What a revelation\", Bakugou gritted his teeth, hands forming small explosions in his fury.\u00a0\nHe abruptly stood up, ignoring Iida's weak attempt at getting him to sit down, but his voice was quiet and hesitant, like he knew he had no right to say anything.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"Bakugou!\" Sero made a move to stand up and hold the other back from leaving, but the spiky haired boy whirled around and let out more sparks from his palms.\u00a0\n\"Shut the fuck up! I told you, didn't I? That stupid Deku was too much of a soft crybaby to do anything!\"\u00a0\nHe turned and glared at everyone with his bright red eyes, which seemed to be glowing from the sheer anger he felt.\n\"And you, Shitty hair!\" Katsuki whirled around to glare at Eijirou coldly. \"I expected more of you, fucking coward!\" he scoffed and waltzed out the door, slamming it close with so much force, everyone wondered how the door hadn't broken down.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut mostly, no one reacted to the blonde's outburst, too lost in their own thoughts.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nUraraka was crying, as well as Ashido and Kirishima.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJiro, Kaminari and Momo were looking at their tables in horror, the realiy of what they'd done sinking in.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"Wh-What do you m-mean, sensei?\" Mina asked in between hiccups. \"Everyone was so sure about this, h-how...?\"\n\u00a0\nShe remembered Shinsou's and Todoroki's words from before, and couldn't help but let out even more sobs, hanging her head in shame and devastation.\n\u00a0\nMidoriya was one of the friends she had cherished the most, yet they all started treating him as if he were diseased just because of what? Some teacher's words?\nShe didn't even know what kind of notes Midoriya had been writing, and just because their teachers said there was a possibility, they immediately took that as a 'he is the traitor, be careful'.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKirishima knew very well that there wasn't any making this right. He was a failure, and as Bakugou said, a coward for not having stepped up to help Midoriya.\u00a0\nFrom the start, he knew that Izuku couldn't be the traitor, because Bakugou was Midoribro's childhood friend, and Bakugou didn't believe Aizawa-sensei.\u00a0\nHe had wanted to cry out, scream at everyone to stop labeling him as a traitor, just because of someone's suspicion but...\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe realized that even his best friend Kaminari, as well as Mina and Sero believed Aizawa. That was the point where he chose to be a coward, and pretend he believed in those rumors.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom that day where their homeroom teacher had said that, Kaminari and the others started treating Bakugou like an enemy as well. They would say that his quirk seemed to have melted his brain, or that maybe Bakugou was a villain as well, with how he behaved.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"You're with us bro, right? We know what's right, and that explodo boy can go to hell!\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThat was what they'd asked him. And just like the coward he was, Kirishima had grinned amd said that yeah, of course he was with them, while his heart was breaking.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd Bakugou was right.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe'd expected himself to have more pride as well. He also thought that he respected himself more, because wasn't he the one always shouting about manliness and friendship?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut the way Bakugou said it. The fact that he expected more of him. He, Bakugou, who Kirishima had been trying to befriend since the first day.\u00a0\nAnd after the revelation, now that it was out that Midoriya wasn't the traitor, he knew he could never look at himself with respect again.\u00a0\nHe could never stand tall and proud knowing that he did something like that.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe could only hope he'd get\u00a0 the chance to prove himself worthy of the green haired boy's friendship again.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGlancing over at Uraraka and Iida, the red haired male couldn't help but grimace and feel his heart break even more, because the two had been one of the boy's best friends. And the expression on both their faces were downright miserable.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIida and Uraraka felt like failures as human beings and friends.\u00a0\nAizawa said Midoriya was innocent, which meant that every single instance where they had avoided him, or kept their eyes on him out of fear and suspicion had been nothing more than a mistake.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs the class president, Iida was devastated.\u00a0\nHe'd had his doubt since the teachers told them about it, and he didn't want to believe that Midoriya was the traitor.\u00a0\nBut seeing as his whole life had been involved with trusting teachers and authority figures, he didn't think that Aizawa and everyone else could be wrong about that.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd even if he would like to selfishly blame it on the teachers for making such a grave mistake, he couldn't, because he knew he was in the same boat as everyone else.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAfter all, no one had forced him to distance himself from his friend, it had been of his own volition that he chose to do so.\u00a0\n\"Iida-kun... We're such horrible people!\" Uraraka whispered in between sobs as she didn't even bother wiping away her tears.\nApparently, she had been Izuku's first friend.\u00a0\nHe had trusted her so much, and she took that trust and ripped it to pieces by backstabbing him, instead of just asking about her entry in the notebook as she should have done.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"What's going to happen now, sensei?\" Kaminari quietly asked, wiping his own tears with his sleeves.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"I don't know, Kaminari\", Shouta told them for about the third time this day.\n\u00a0\nApologizing wouldn't be enough, but what should they do indeed...\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe really had to talk to Hizashi about this.\u00a0\nThe man hated him for sure, but he didn't know how to go on without his husband.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"I understand that this is very shocking right now, and you'll be excused from classes tomorrow, seeing as the staff will also take a break\", he explained and dismissed the class, heading straight out of the door without looking back.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe knew that right now, he couldn't help his class, not when his own thoughts were in such disarray.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nInside of the classroom, everyone had reverted back to silence and was sitting in their seats with their heads down.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHow could they have failed so bad?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTodoroki and Shinsou, as well as Asui and Bakugou ALL told them not to jump to conclusions, and to hear that from someone like Bakugou, it must have meant something.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe knew Midoriya the longest and the best, despite their history together and if even he himself was saying that Midoriya was innocent, then it must have meant something.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut they all decided to ignore that and still accuse their classmate and friend of something he wasn't.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"Guys\", Mina started. \"How are we going to make this right?\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut nobody knew the answer.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey didn't know if they ever would.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0"
