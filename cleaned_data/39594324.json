    "text": "After the dust settles and things start to resume their post-Upside-Down norm for the  fourth  time, Dustin starts acting weird. Not in a bad way \u2014 in fact, Steve doesn\u2019t even notice at first. Dustin starts hanging around Family Video more often, always lingering by the desk whenever Steve\u2019s deep in conversation with a girl. He starts hovering. He starts staring.\u00a0\n\u201cOut with it,\u201d Steve eventually says, tired of whatever game Dustin\u2019s playing. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\u00a0\nDustin smiles, innocent. \u201cI just wanted to see you,\u201d he says, looking up with huge eyes like he knows he can make Steve fold. It only works a little bit.\u00a0\n\u201cNice try,\u201d Steve says, flatly. He folds his arms across his chest and leans over the desk. \u201cWanna give it another go?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cFine,\u201d Dustin says. \u201cI\u2019m worried about you.\u201d\u00a0\nThis pulls Steve up short. It\u2019s an unusual sentiment from Dustin. \u201cOkay,\u201d he contemplates, slowly, drumming his fingers on the countertop. \u201cWould you like to \u2026 elaborate on that?\u201d\u00a0\nDustin, ever-blunt, says, \u201cYou\u2019re not doing anything with your life.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, fuck you. Out you go.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, Steve, wait. Okay, I could have been more tactful.\u201d Dustin pleads, raising his hands up as a sign of surrender. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it  that  way; we\u2019re all very grateful you turned down college to stay here even if you don\u2019t wanna admit it.\u201d Which, okay, how the fuck\u2014 \u201cBut, I mean you\u2019re \u2026 you know,  lonely.\u201d\n\u201cNo I\u2019m not,\u201d says Steve, because he isn\u2019t. Yes, sometimes he does watch Robin\u2019s lingering gaze catch on Nancy. Sometimes it cuts to see couples flirting between the shelves. Sometimes he watches Max and Lucas do their back-and-forth and feels maybe a bit bereft,\u00a0but he\u2019s not  lonely.\u00a0 \n\u201cSteve, I haven\u2019t seen you go on a date in weeks, maybe even  months!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cAnd why is that your business?\u201d Steve smooths a tired hand down his face. \u201cSeriously, it\u2019s none of your concern what I\u2019m doing with my \u2026 with my love life.\u201d\u00a0\nDustin pillows his arms on the counter, resting his chin on them. Steve wonders when Dustin's growth spurt will really kick in. He won\u2019t be a beanpole, but Steve\u2019s convinced he\u2019ll fill out in his shoulders, probably end up with the football physique Steve never quite achieved himself.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat about \u2026 Linda? From the diner across town?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cLinda is twenty-seven,\u201d Steve says, flatly, \u201cand I\u2019m pretty sure the cook is her baby daddy.\u201d He cocks his hip, biting absently at his thumbnail. \u201cJust because she gives us an extra waffle when we go doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m gonna hook up with her.\u201d\n\u201cThis is more than a hookup, Steve,\u201d says Dustin, offended. \u201cI am helping you look for  love.\u201d\u00a0\nBefore Steve can so much as snort derisively, someone speaks up.\n\u201cMight be worth letting him help.\u201d\u00a0\nSteve just about has a heart attack, shooting up ramrod straight and bumping the phone off its hook. \u201cHoly shit,\u201d he curses, hand over his chest like he\u2019s clutching at pearls. \u201cWhere the  fuck did you come from, Munson?\u201d\u00a0\nEddie grins. \u201cI was just standing here at the shelves, Stevie. Not my fault you can\u2019t keep track of your customers.\u201d\u00a0\nDustin rocks back and forth on his feet. \u201cEddie!\u201d He cheers, leaning into the gentle side hug Eddie bestows upon him. \u201cYou think Steve should listen to me, right?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cSure. You\u2019ve been known to have the occasional good idea.\u201d\u00a0\nEddie\u2019s not wearing his jackets today. His shirt is plain, a deep navy blue that compliments the pink tinge to his cheeks. The internal heating in Family Video is bust, leaving them all sweating in winter and close to heatstroke in summer. His hair is perfectly curled, his Bambi-brown eyes sweeping up to meet Steve\u2019s gaze.\u00a0\nSteve wets his lips and looks away. \u201cI don\u2019t need you to hook me up with anyone.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cSteve,\u201d Dustin says, carefully, gaze darting to Eddie. He looks a bit apologetic when he says, \u201cI\u2019ve been coming in every day for two weeks. In that time, you\u2019ve hit on no less than seventeen girls, and each and every one of them has either left within minutes or name-dropped their boyfriend several times. You\u2019re striking out.\u201d\nSteve\u2019s humiliated. Shame tickles his gut. He wishes Eddie would just leave so that Dustin\u2019s blunt honesty would only meet Steve\u2019s ears. His shoulders hike up without his permission.\u00a0\n\u201cC\u2019mon, Henderson.\u201d Like a divine being parting the clouds, Eddie steps in. \u201cLay off. We just came outta one of the most traumatic weeks of our life. I think it\u2019s only fair Harrington has time to get his shit back together.\u201d\u00a0\nSteve wonders if it\u2019s worth getting punched to lean across the counter and kiss him. Not that he would want to, just like, you know, as a favour for saving his reputation and feelings. Steve shakes his arms out, suddenly full of restless energy.\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, but I\u2019m just concerned. I\u2019m worried he\u2019s still not over Nancy.\u201d\n\u201cDustin,\u201d Steve says, sharply. \u201cC\u2019mon, dude. Not cool. Leave it. I told you that it\u2019s over between us; you gotta take my word on that.\u201d\u00a0\nEddie eyes him consideringly. His face is a frustratingly blank slate, but the deep amber-brown of his eyes are hypnotising and speak volumes. Unfortunately, Steve's never been a great reader. They spend a beat staring at each other before Steve tugs himself back into the conversation.\u00a0\n\u201cYou could try for Susan Peckley? She\u2019s on the cheer squad, so\u2014\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s a teenager. No.\u201d\n\u201cSteve,  you\u2019re a teenager.\u201d\u00a0\nSteve presses his fingers against his temples and massages. \u201cLet me clarify, she\u2019s an  underage teenager. No high schoolers, even if they\u2019re eighteen.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIs that why you won\u2019t kiss Robin?\u201d\u00a0\nNow the conversation is really over. Steve does his best not to glare at Dustin, because he gets this all comes from a genuine place of love, but it\u2019s difficult. Eddie, ridiculously observant as always, tucks two hands behind Dustin\u2019s back and starts shoving him at the shelves.\n\u201cAlright, pipsqueak,\u201d he says, chidingly. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go find a movie for tomorrow night, alright? Make sure it\u2019s scary, none of this boring zombie shit. Let the adults talk.\u201d\u00a0\nAnd maybe Dustin\u2019s a little bit perceptive too, because instead of whining he casts Steve an apologetic puppy-eyed look and trudges off to the corner of the store.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to rent it out under your name,\u201d Steve says. \u201cHe\u2019s probably gonna find something R-rated.\u201d\u00a0\nEddie shrugs. He fiddles with the thin, gold necklace that sits over his shirt. His rings shine a little in the white light of the store, chipped red polish coating his nails. Steve dithers. He has no idea what to say. He feels nervous, always so nervous whenever Eddie is around.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cDidn\u2019t realise babysitter was synonymous with brother. Guess it kinda makes sense, given how much the two of you think the sun shines outta each other\u2019s ass.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYou can have him,\u201d Steve mutters, exhausted.\u00a0\nHe slumps forward and pillows his chin on the palm of his hand. This has the unfortunate side effect of bringing him much closer to Eddie. From this angle, glancing up, Steve can see the lightest sprinkle of freckles across Eddie\u2019s cheeks. He pushes down the sudden urge to press his fingers into them. Weird. The summer heat is driving him loopy.\n\u201cI\u2019d want a refund pretty quick,\u201d Eddie murmurs, laughing.\u00a0His eyes glimmer, mouth twitching with mirth. He shuffles to the side and stoops as well. It\u2019s not a very comfy position for either of them, given their height, but it does bring them back to eye level.\u00a0\u201cIs he always like that?\u201d\u00a0\nSteve hums. \u201cKinda. I guess he\u2019s decided it\u2019s pathetic that I\u2019m single when he\u2019s not, so here we are. I\u2019m worried he\u2019s gonna start matchmaking me with like, Maggie Jones.\u201d At Eddie\u2019s blank look, he tacks on, \u201cYou know, about fifty, smokes ten packs of cigarettes a day, hits small children with brooms when they get in her way?\u201d\u00a0\nA few weeks ago, Steve heard Eddie laugh for the first time. When the rubble had cleared and Steve had been on the brink of death from blood loss for the second time, Eleven had said, exhausted, \u2018it\u2019s over.\u2019 Eddie had fallen to his knees with a heavy groan and then burst into hysterics. It had quickly morphed into sobs but really, at that point, his reaction had been more than warranted.\u00a0\nThe laughter Eddie gives now is lighter, breathier. He presses the palm of his hand into his mouth, like he doesn\u2019t want to admit he thinks Steve is funny. Something smug takes a seat in Steve\u2019s rib cage. Steve Harrington\u2019s still got it, he thinks, and then feels only somewhat pathetic.\u00a0\n\u201cI dunno, Mrs Maggie Harrington kinda has a ring to it. Plus, she\u2019s got a van, right?\u201d\n\u201cFor her several thousand cats, yes,\u201d confirms Steve, unable to help his smile. One of Eddie\u2019s hands rests on the desk between them; Steve reaches out to poke at one of the rings unthinkingly.\u00a0\n\u201cYou could repurpose the van for your toddler squad,\u201d Eddie hums. He turns his hand over and lets Steve slide the ring off. \u201cHenderson loves cats, right? He\u2019d be all for it. All  fur it.\u201d\u00a0\nSteve slides the ring on. It\u2019s slightly too big for his middle finger, but fits well around his thumb. Eddie\u2019s fingers are wider, he thinks idly, and his hands are a little larger. Eddie makes no move to take the ring back, instead continuing to list off several cat-related puns.\u00a0\nSteve lets himself watch, chin pillowed. Eddie\u2019s expressive, always swaying into everyone's personal space and going off on tangents that fly over Steve\u2019s head but are entertaining nonetheless. His hair bounces as he does, long lashes dusting his cheeks as he screws his face up in thought.\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Stevie, we can get you a girl.\u201d\u00a0\nI don\u2019t need one, Steve almost says. He hasn\u2019t dated anyone since Nancy, and the handful of dates he\u2019s been on have felt lacklustre. There\u2019s something missing. He doesn\u2019t know what, and he doesn\u2019t know how to find it, but something doesn\u2019t fit.\u00a0\nSteve worries at his bottom lip. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d he says, after a bit. \u201cYou got a girl?\u201d\u00a0\nEddie messes with his hair. He runs his fingers through the curls and tugs at a ringlet. \u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cBetween being the town freak and then the town serial killer, I haven\u2019t exactly had time for romance.\u201d He smiles thinly.\u00a0\nSteve hates it. \u201cFuck it,\u201d he says, shrugging. He spins the ring around and around. \u201cWe can be single together. Maybe we\u2019ll make it a trend, y\u2019know?\u201d\u00a0\nEddie\u2019s smile smooths out, becoming fuller, warmer. \u201cSingles Club? It\u2019d be what, you, me, Robin. Yeah, listen, that could work. In fact, I motion that we meet every Wednesday to cry about it.\u201d\u00a0\nSteve ducks his head as he laughs, pressing his fingers into Eddie\u2019s forearm. \u201cI think you\u2019re missing the point, Munson. We\u2019re  happy being single. Being single is the new taken.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYou are insane,\u201d Eddie murmurs, patting Steve\u2019s hand. Steve\u2019s fingers tingle like he\u2019s swallowed a can of fizz, so he curls them into his palm, chasing away the feeling. \u201cI better go find the pipsqueak,\u201d Eddie sighs.\u00a0\nHe disappears into the shelves before Steve can make an excuse for him to stay. When he hangs the closing sign up later that night, the moonlight catches on his thumb. Eddie\u2019s ring, thick black band with little green gems, looks back up at him.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nDistressingly, Dustin really doesn\u2019t let the matchmaking go. On Sunday, Robin sits in the backroom counting through new stock while Steve mans the counter. Given it\u2019s so early, there\u2019s nothing much to do beyond straighten fliers, snoop through the records, or consider which Star Wars movie should play on loop today.\u00a0\nSteve fiddles with  The Empire Strikes Back, bored out of his mind. He stares down at the ring on his thumb. Two weeks ago Eddie let him steal it, and Steve keeps meaning to give it back but, well, he gets caught up in whatever Eddie\u2019s talking about, or in listening to him grumble about the record shop refusing to stock heavy metal, or watching him play air guitar, and forgets. It\u2019s easy to forget himself around Eddie. He doesn\u2019t want to know why.\u00a0\n\u201cHey, did you see that Keith ordered  porn?  Can we get him fired for this? It\u2019s not even  good  porn. Listen, I\u2019ll read the back cover\u2014\u201d\u00a0\nSteve pushes the door open to the back room and peers in to see Robin sprawled across the floor, eyes wide and expression disgusted.\u00a0\n\u201cRob,\u201d he says, \u201clet\u2019s think this through.\u201d\nRobin looks up at him. \u201cIf you\u2019re about to stand up for him\u2026\u201d\nSteve interrupts with a wave of his hand. \u201cNo. See, I\u2019m thinking, it\u2019s about time we had a holiday, right? And Keith probably doesn\u2019t want to lose the only position that gives him some power. I say we threaten him into a week off, still paid.\u201d\u00a0\nRobin\u2019s grin seeps across her mouth slowly. Her eyes darken, devious, impressed. \u201cMy, my, the Russians  did change you.\u201d She tosses him the VHS. \u201cHide it in my locker. Keith\u2019s more likely to check yours than mine. He\u2019s on the close tonight \u2014 I cross over with him. Let\u2019s make this happen.\u201d\u00a0\nSteve\u2019s still laughing when they duck back into the main room twenty minutes later to the sound of the doorbell chiming. Dustin Henderson idles at the doorway, headphones blasting something chaotic and drum-heavy into his ears. Probably the work of Eddie.\u00a0\n\u201cNo Munson means no R-ratings,\u201d Robin reminds Dustin, hands on her hips.\u00a0\nDustin turns his tape deck off, headphones pooling around his neck. \u201cBut Steve\u2019s here,\u201d he whines.\u00a0\n\u201cSteve can\u2019t hear you,\u201d says Steve, shoving  The Empire Strikes Back  into the TV. \u201cSteve also thinks little kids should know we have  The Dark Crystal back in stock, which is a pretty good movie, even if Kira looks like Tammy Thompson.\u201d\u00a0\nRobin smacks him. Steve laughs, catching her hand and tugging her in a circle as he croons the national anthem. They\u2019re halfway through the first verse, laughing into each other\u2019s shoulders when Dustin clears his throat and raps on the desk.\u00a0\nDetangling themselves, Steve rolls his eyes. \u201cFine, you can hop the counter, but  only \u2018cause it\u2019s too early for anyone to see.\u201d He and Robin side-eye each other. Steve grins, malicious, \u201cAnd only \u2018cause we got something to hold over Keith forever.\u201d\u00a0\nRobin puckers her lips and makes an obscene gesture, so of course that sets them off again. When they finally straighten, Dustin\u2019s standing near the TV, more than a little confused. He teeters on the edge of saying something. Steve watches him shove his hands in his pockets, rip them back out, brush the palms against his pants, and rinse and repeat.\u00a0\n\u201cDo you not like boys, Robin?\u201d he eventually asks in such a rush that it takes Steve a second to parse. When he does, he freezes. Dustin blinks. \u201cThat\u2019s the only other reason I can think of. You know, that you guys wouldn\u2019t be \u2026\u201d He waves his hand between the two of them. \u201cDating.\u201d\nSteve has a hand around Dustin\u2019s arm before he can think. Not aggressively, or angrily, just a firm grip that he uses to tug Dustin forward.\u00a0\n\u201cHenderson, I love you, but you\u2019re crossing a line, man. You can\u2019t just toss that shit around \u2014 you have no idea what it could do.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI know some people are gay, Steven.\u201d Severely unimpressed, Dustin folds his arms across his chest, dislodging Steve\u2019s grip. Despite the store being empty outside the three of them, Steve and Robin both stoop to hush him.\u00a0\n\u201cDustin,\u201d Steve starts, catching the panic that\u2019s beginning to make Robin shake from the corner of his eyes. He reaches out to loop their fingers together and she grabs his hand tightly, palm sweaty. \u201cIf you know that, then you know you need to be careful, right? This \u2026 this is serious, Henderson.\u201d\nIncredibly, Dustin looks more upset than Robin for a moment. \u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d he starts, loudly. He shuffles closer to hurriedly whisper, \u201cI\u2019m not homophobic! Lady Kalevala likes women.\u201d Dustin looks up at Robin with huge, beseeching eyes.\u00a0\nSteve hears her suck in a breath. \u201cWho the hell is Lady Kevlar?\u201d To her credit, she sounds only slightly strangulated.\u00a0\n\u201cKalevala,\u201d Dustin corrects. Then he tosses his hands up. \u201cHonestly, this is why you should really come to our campaigns,\u201d he mutters. Then he steps closer still until they\u2019re all pressed into a tiny group huddle just behind the desk. \u201cShe\u2019s one of the main villains in Eddie\u2019s latest campaign. She likes girls. But!\u201d Dustin raises a finger and says, firmly, \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that she isn\u2019t evil  because  she\u2019s gay. She just so happens to like both women  and world domination.\u201d\u00a0\nSteve feels like he\u2019s been punched in the face. In a way, it\u2019s not really surprising Eddie is cool with the whole gay thing. After all, he\u2019s a social pariah, a reject, and unfortunately, Steve knows a lot of people like Robin are shoved into the same category.\u00a0\n\u201cReally?\u201d Robin asks, quietly. Her fingers have lost their desperate grip, but Steve doesn\u2019t let go. He thumbs the back of her hand as comfortingly as he can. \u201cHe\u2019s uh, he doesn\u2019t care?\u201d\u00a0\nDustin nods. He shuffles a little and then reaches out only to pause, an aborted, awkward movement. After a moment, his fingers settle lightly around Robin\u2019s forearm. Carefully, he says, \u201cNone of us do. It took Mike a bit to come to terms with it, but I think that was \u2018cause there was \u2014\u201d He stops. \u201cActually, I don\u2019t think I should explain why. But listen, we\u2019d all have your back. You know, if you  did like girls.\u201d\u00a0\nRobin\u2019s laughter is shaky and maybe a tiny bit wet. Steve slides his arm around her waist and she wilts into his side with a hiccup.\u00a0\n\u201cChrist,\u201d she murmurs. \u201cJesus Christ, Dustin.\u201d\u00a0\nDustin hovers, unsure, glancing between the two of them.\u00a0\n\u201cI like girls,\u201d Robin says, very quietly.\u00a0\nDustin smiles that gummy little grin that Steve adores. \u201cCool,\u201d he says. \u201c\u2018Cause you kinda remind me of Kalevala. Not the evil bit, but she\u2019s super kickass.\u201d\u00a0\nRobin beams. \u201cC\u2019mere,\u201d she says, tugging Dustin forward. He crashes into the two of them and Steve is quick to wrap an arm around the kid\u2019s back. \u201cYou\u2019re alright, Henderson. I think I get why you\u2019re Steve\u2019s favourite.\u201d She runs a hand through his hair, ruffling it.\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d says Steve, simply, because she\u2019s right. Dustin is his favourite. \u201cBut hey, now you\u2019re in the know, make sure you don\u2019t go blabbing. And maybe give it a rest about us getting together, \u2018cause like\u2026\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNever in a million years,\u201d Robin laughs. \u201cI got better taste, y\u2019know.\u201d\u00a0\nDustin\u2019s resulting laughter only gets louder when Steve whines out an indignant, \u201cHey!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Robin\u2019s coming out, Dustin manages to lay off for a solid three weeks. Then the summer holidays finally bloom on the horizon and with it, a lot of free time for the kids.\u00a0\n\u201cSteve,\u201d says Dustin on Tuesday, chowing down on an ice pop. The sticky blue syrup drips down the pole to puddle against Dustin\u2019s wrist, dripping onto the floor every now and then.\u00a0\n\u201cOff the carpet, Henderson,\u201d says Steve.\u00a0\nDustin sits on the counter. Steve shoves a rag under his wrist with a grumble, fruitlessly trying to keep his hair off his forehead. The aircon is  still fucked, and at the rate he\u2019s going, he\u2019ll be dead of heatstroke before Robin makes it in the door.\u00a0\n\u201cSo I was thinking,\u201d Dustin says. He offers his ice pop to Steve, which,  gross,  and when Steve gently shoves it away, shrugs. \u201cYour loss.\u201d He slurps on the treat for a bit, and then continues. \u201cSo I was thinking. Robin's off the table, and you don\u2019t like Linda, you don\u2019t like Meg, Susan, Patty,  or Melanie.\u201d\u00a0\nSteve is patient. Steve is kind. Steve is not mean to kids. He smiles politely and uses all his willpower to keep from shoving Dustin off the desk. Kid\u2019s barely got any bones as it is \u2014 he doesn\u2019t wanna damage what\u2019s left.\u00a0\nDustin worries at his bottom lip. Steve is abruptly reminded of their conversation with Robin, just a few weeks ago. He narrows his gaze, prodding Dustin\u2019s knee.\u00a0\n\u201cOut with it, Henderson,\u201d he says.\u00a0\n\u201cI was just thinking \u2026\u201d Dustin stops. \u201cListen, it\u2019s \u2026 okay, I  know you said you don\u2019t like Nancy. I know you did. But, it\u2019s only... Mike says she and Jonathan broke up, and that they\u2019re both surprisingly okay with it, and that Nancy has her eye on someone.\u201d\u00a0\nIt\u2019s like being hit by a bus. Steve\u2019s breath catches in his throat and for a brief second, panic floods through him. \u201cIt\u2019s not me,\u201d he says, firmly, quickly. The thought that it might be isn\u2019t pleasant. Steve\u2019s not sure when his love for Nancy finally morphed into something more platonic, but he\u2019s certainly just become aware that it has.\u00a0\n\u201cI know you\u2019re nervous or scared or something about it,\u201d Dustin says, thankfully not recognising Steve\u2019s shortness of breath and sudden near-fainting as alarm. \u201cBut Nancy\u2019s cool. She can use a gun really well, she\u2019s  super  smart, and she\u2019s got great hair. You have great hair too, so your kids would  definitely be perfect.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWoah,\u201d Steve cries, pushing himself away from the desk. His palms leave sweaty outlines against the countertop. \u201cUh uh, no. Dial it back a notch, buddy.  No.  No kids, no Nancy, no \u2026 no whatever this is.\u201d\n\u201cBut  Steve,\u201d Dustin whines, discarding the remnants of the ice pole onto the cloth. \u201cI really think you should at least talk to her. I even told  her that, and she said yeah, you guys should.\u201d\u00a0\nOh no, Steve thinks. Oh no. Jesus fucking Christ, no.\u00a0\n\u201cYou guys are meant to get milkshakes after your shift. I said you\u2019d pick her up.\u201d\u00a0\nWhether from the heat or the horror of the conversation, Steve crumbles. He drops to a squat, gripping the shelves behind the counter for dear life. His head swims, his lips are steadily becoming chewed raw, and he wants to use Dustin\u2019s mop head to clean the floor.\u00a0\n\u201cYou are banned from Family Video,\u201d Steve says, upon resurfacing. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna see you in here for the rest of the summer. Scram.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cBut you\u2019re gonna see Nancy, right? Because it would be fucked up if you didn\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0\nThe thing about Dustin is that he\u2019s kind, but he\u2019s so unreasonably and frustratingly stubborn.\u00a0\n\u201cI love you,\u201d Steve says, measuredly, \u201cbut I\u2019m very upset with you. I\u2019ll see Nancy, because we both should finally clear the air, but I want you to seriously stop messing with my love life, okay?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI love you too,\u201d says Dustin. He looks shell shocked and ashamed in equal parts. He clambers off the desk and shuffles on the spot, head ducked. \u201cSorry Steve,\u201d he mutters. \u201cI just wanted to help.\u201d\nSteve brushes his fingers through the kid\u2019s mop of hair. \u201cI know,\u201d he says, \u201cbut you gotta let this one go, okay? Go on. Let me cool off. I\u2019ll see you Thursday for dinner with your Ma, anyway.\u201d\u00a0\nDustin nods. \u201cOkay,\u201d he says, dejected. \u201cBye Steve.\u201d\u00a0\nHe wanders over to the door, forlorn, and for fuck\u2019s sake, Steve really hates the part of him that decided to quasi-adopt the kid, because he\u2019s helpless to stop himself from rounding the desk.\n\u201cDustin.\u201d\nDustin looks over his shoulder, hand on the door.\nSteve comes to a stop in front of him. \u201cI know you didn\u2019t mean to upset me. I love you, okay, kid? I\u2019ll be over it within a half hour.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Dustin purses his lips. \u201cIt was kinda shitty of me, I recognise that. I promise to let it go.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cAw, Dust.\u201d Steve sighs. \u201cC\u2019mere.\u201d Even though it\u2019s hotter than Satan\u2019s ass, Steve scoops Dustin into a hug. It\u2019s sticky and uncomfortable, but still pleasant.\u00a0\nDustin melts into him instantly, squeezing the life out of Steve. \u201cSorry,\u201d he says again, muffled against Steve\u2019s shirt. \u201cI\u2019ll ask Ma to make chocolate mousse.\u201d He pulls back, wincing when their skin sticks.\u00a0\n\u201cFuck yes.\u201d Steve grins. He pushes open the door and ushers Dustin outside. \u201cI\u2019ll see you Thursday,\u201d he promises, watching Dustin wander off.\nThe rest of the evening passes too quickly for Steve\u2019s liking. He spends forty minutes drafting a dot point speech, feels like a moron, blanks out halfway through  The Neverending Story,  and shuts Family Video half an hour early from panic. It\u2019s not like Keith\u2019s gonna tell him off, given he\u2019s still having a heart attack over the porno scare.\nSteve practices his speech on the way to the Wheelers. He smiles at Nancy when she slides in the car, but they don\u2019t speak until they\u2019re seated in their booth, two vanilla shakes in front of them.\u00a0\n\u201cDustin said you wanted to talk?\u201d Nancy rests her hands on the table. She\u2019s got a pretty gold bracelet on, with a little cherry charm. It reminds Steve of Eddie\u2019s guitar, glittering ruby.\u00a0\n\u201cUh.\u201d Steve tilts his head. \u201cNo, Dustin said  you wanted to \u2026 Oh, yeah. Okay, this makes sense.\u201d Steve sucks in a deep breath and thinks of his speech. Then he throws it out the window when he opens his fat mouth. \u201cCards on the table, I don\u2019t wanna get back together.\u201d\nNancy reels. Her eyes go round. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise that was \u2026 an option,\u201d she says, carefully. She tucks a strand of hair behind her ears. She\u2019s wearing a headband. It\u2019s cute. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get back together either. Steve, we had a good time, and I did care for you, but. I don\u2019t think we \u2026 I don\u2019t think we were right for each other.\u201d\nIt doesn\u2019t sting the way it used to. Steve smiles. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says, relieved. \u201cI loved you, but now I love you in a different way. You\u2019re one of my best friends, Nance. I wish we\u2019d had time to sit down and talk about it.\u201d\u00a0\nNancy smiles. It\u2019s a little sad, but she reaches across the table to squeeze his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re one of my best friends too. I think it\u2019s okay that it took us time to get here.\u201d She takes a few gulps of her milkshake. \u201cI guess you know Jonathan and I broke up, then.\u201d\n\u201cDustin told me.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cFigured. He\u2019s pretty good at secrets unless you\u2019re involved.\u201d Nancy still laughs with her whole body, nose wrinkling, eyes half disappearing beneath her bunched cheeks.\u00a0\n\u201cLuckily I\u2019m a good secret keeper myself,\u201d Steve whispers, glancing furtively around the diner. He splays his fingers on the table and says, \u201cFor example, I know Dustin calls Suzie  pumpkin-pie.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d Nancy gasps. \u201cWait, I thought it was Suzie-poo?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThat too. I think he\u2019s actually got a list that he cycles through. Snugglepants definitely came up at one point.\u201d\u00a0\nThey laugh for a little bit. Nancy catches him up on her and Jonathan, on the newspaper, on her college applications and acceptance letters. Finally, with the sun finally dipping over the horizon, the conversation comes to a stop.\u00a0Steve watches her fiddle with her bracelet. She stares out the window absently, eyes far away.\n\u201cNance?\u201d Steve touches the back of her hand, gentle. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\u00a0\nNancy doesn\u2019t quite meet his gaze. She fiddles with her straw, stirring it around the empty glass. Steve waits patiently; Nancy\u2019s one of the few people he\u2019d give all his time for.\u00a0\n\u201cI suppose Dustin also told you I have my eye on someone?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, but I didn\u2019t believe him or anything.\u201d\u00a0\nNancy\u2019s laugh is more of a huff. \u201cYeah,\u201d she says, quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s not entirely a lie.\u201d Now her shoulders fold in, hands dropping to her lap. Steve watches her wilt, concerned. \u201cI don\u2019t have my eye on one person, but\u2026\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNancy.\u201d Steve reaches across the table, palm up. \u201cWhatever it is,\u201d he says, squeezing her hand when she places it in his, \u201cI\u2019m here for you. I have your back. We didn\u2019t go through like, several apocalypse scares for you to not be able to trust me.\u201d\u00a0\nNancy sucks in a sharp breath. \u201cWhat I actually said was that I had my eye on  something else.\u201d Her gaze is intense, steely, sharp. \u201cI meant women.\u201d She doesn\u2019t stutter, but her gaze darts left. \u201cI\u2019ve realised that there is a much bigger ocean of fish than I previously anticipated. I\u2019m not a lesbian, but I did some research after Vecna \u2026 after it all. Have you heard of bisexuality?\u201d\u00a0\nIt\u2019s like being sucked through a jet engine. It\u2019s like hurtling towards Earth at a million miles an hour. It\u2019s like the stupid fucking demobats chowing down on his stomach.\u00a0\n\u201cSteve?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cSorry. Here. Present. Listening.\u201d Steve stumbles over his words, sucking his bottom lip into his mouth. He clasps Nancy\u2019s hand between both of his. \u201cNot  judging,\u201d he says, emphatically. \u201cVery,  very  supportive.\u201d\u00a0\nThe steel seeps from Nancy\u2019s eyes and spine. She folds halfway across the table with a relieved sigh, smiling just a little. \u201cOkay,\u201d she murmurs, \u201cthank you.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what bisexuality means, though.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt means I\u2019m into boys and girls,\u201d Nancy says. \u201cThat I don\u2019t really have a preference.\u201d She taps at the table, completely unaware of the revelation that\u2019s unfolding itself in Steve\u2019s mind. Both. You can like both.\u00a0\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Nancy continues, \u201cit\u2019s all fluid. I\u2019ve found far more men attractive, but there\u2019s the occasional girl, you know? I like the weird ones.\u201d Her lips twitch as she holds back a laugh. \u201cYou know, the ones that are unique.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWow,\u201d Steve says, ignoring visions of Eddie\u2019s hands and Nancy\u2019s smile and every time he\u2019d avert his gaze from shirtless guys in the locker room. \u201cThat\u2019s why we didn\u2019t work out, huh? Cuz I\u2019m super normal.\u201d He sighs, morose. \u201cI wasn\u2019t special enough.\u201d\u00a0\nNancy pats his hand. \u201cToo cookie cutter,\u201d she murmurs, sadly. \u201cDidn\u2019t have a secret passion for photography or own every Weird Al album.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cLike Robin,\u201d Steve laughs. \u201cShe\u2019s super into him!\u201d He misses Nancy\u2019s panicked look. \u201cNot sure I see the appeal, personally.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cRight,\u201d Nancy says, quickly. \u201cSo.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cSo.\u201d\nThey sit in silence for a little bit longer. Then Steve can\u2019t take it anymore and leans over the table. \u201cSo, it\u2019s like a thing then, to swing both ways? Bisexuality.\u201d He sounds the word out, tasting it on his tongue, wondering if he\u2019ll go home and look at himself in the mirror and try it on for size.\u00a0\nNancy tilts her head a little. \u201cYes. Sexuality is a spectrum. Gender probably is too. I haven\u2019t researched much about that yet, but I think I\u2019d like to when I go to college.\u201d\u00a0\nSteve nods, pretends he understands what the spectrum is. \u201cWell, it\u2019s cool with me. I won\u2019t go around telling people but uh,\u201d he licks his lips, \u201cI get the feeling you\u2019d be pretty safe with a lot of  us.\u201d He tries to emphasise his meaning, thinking about what Dustin had said to Robin a few weeks ago.\u00a0\nNancy\u2019s eyes widen, then narrow, then she tilts her head, puppy-like, and levels him with a thousand yard stare. It\u2019s like she\u2019s shifting through his every thought, digging her way down to his soul. Then she smiles.\u00a0\n\u201cCool,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m glad I\u2019m safe with  certain people.\u201d She gives him a pointed look he doesn\u2019t understand. He smiles anyway.\u00a0\nSteve leans back in his seat. \u201cWell, this has been great, seriously, but I do have to get home. I\u2019m opening tomorrow, \u2018cause I wanted the afternoon off.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cBig plans?\u201d Nancy asks as they head towards the beemer.\u00a0\n\u201cNah,\u201d Steve mumbles. \u201cJust seeing Eddie.\u201d He slips into the seat, checks his mirrors, turns the key.\nNancy gives him another one of those looks he doesn\u2019t understand. She squeezes his hand before he clutches the gearstick. \u201cHave fun,\u201d she says. \u201cI hope it goes well.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt will,\u201d he assures her, confused. He feels like there\u2019s a whole conversation going on above his head that he\u2019s somehow still a part of. He has no idea what Nancy\u2019s hinting at, but to admit that would be embarrassing. \u201cI\u2019m just gonna show him the mixtape I made for him.\u201d\u00a0\nNancy beams. \u201cThat\u2019s sweet, Steve. I bet he\u2019ll love it.\u201d\u00a0\nSteve smiles. \u201cHopefully.\u201d He chucks the car into reverse. \u201cC\u2019mon, let\u2019s get you home.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following evening, Steve raps his knuckles against Eddie\u2019s door. The trailer he and his uncle were moved to is on the opposite end of the park. It\u2019s a lot bigger and brand new, like the government really wanted to apologise for fucking them all over  again. Steve admires the half-dead plant in its vibrant blue pot outside the door while he waits.\u00a0\n\u201cGive me a cup of water so I can save this pitiful thing,\u201d he says, when Eddie swings the door open.\n\u201cStevie!\u201d Eddie beams. He falters. \u201cWait, what are we saving?\u201d He peers out the door, mindless of Steve\u2019s personal space, to glance around the park.\u00a0\n\u201cThe pot plant,\u201d Steve sighs, exasperated. He gently pushes Eddie away to trudge inside. He makes his way to the kitchen and rummages around to find and fill a cup. The water doesn\u2019t sink into the soil which is a problem, but Steve doesn\u2019t know enough about plants to solve it.\u00a0\n\u201cUm, so is that it? You came all the way over here from Casa Harrington to save my plant from death?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI think it\u2019s probably already dead,\u201d Steve says, consideringly. He pokes the singular leaf on the plant and watches it break off, landing pathetically on the water-logged soil. \u201cWell.\u201d\u00a0\nEddie snorts. \u201cAlright, get in here before you kill something else.\u201d\u00a0\nSteve grins, feeling unexpectedly abashed. He bites at his cheek as Eddie prods him towards his bedroom. He leaves his shoes just to the side of the door and flops down on Eddie\u2019s bed, which has been made for once.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat can I do for you, my liege?\u201d Eddie plops down beside Steve. He\u2019s wearing navy blue again, and tiny black shorts. Steve\u2019s never seen so much of Eddie's bare legs before. It\u2019s distressingly hard to keep his eyes away from the smooth, summer-tanned skin.\u00a0\nSteve rummages through his bag to tug out the tape. \u201cMade you this,\u201d he says, waving it about. \u201cI figure, you\u2019ve been educating me for the past few weeks, enough that I know who Ozzy is.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThank God,\u201d Eddie nods.\u00a0\n\u201cNow I figure it\u2019s time to show you the wonders of pop.\u201d\u00a0\nEddie groans, flopping back on his bed. \u201cStevie,\u201d he whines. His shorts ride a little higher up his thighs. Steve feels his ears burn. \u201cYou cannot be serious, Harrington. Isn\u2019t it enough I let you play ABBA in the van?\u201d\n\u201cYou fucking love ABBA!\u201d Steve shouts. Offended, he whacks a pillow across Eddie\u2019s face. \u201cShut the fuck up and put this shit on. I considered each track carefully.\u201d\u00a0\nEddie tugs the pillow away from his face, gets up, and begrudgingly shoves the tape into the player atop his robe. \u201cOh yeah?\u201d he says, brushing back his hair. \u201cOrder of best to worst?\u201d\u00a0\nSteve desperately tries to hide his smile but he feels it split his face. \u201cNah,\u201d he says, smug. \u201cIt\u2019s actually in order of songs you\u2019ll hate the most to songs you\u2019ll hate the least. But either way, you\u2019re definitely gonna detest everything you hear tonight.\u201d\nEddie bursts into laughter, hand on his mouth as he folds at the waist. Pride at being able to cause such a reaction surges through Steve.\n\u201cSteve,\u201d Eddie says, shaking his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ve really grasped the concept of a gift. Of course, it\u2019s not your fault, considering you\u2019ve only ever received them, and never actually given one before, my King.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHey, I do a lot of giving!\u201d Steve cries. Then his face goes pink. \u201cWait,\u201d he splutters, but Eddie has already lost it again, slipping from the robe as he falls apart. \u201cOh, fuck off,\u201d Steve huffs.\u00a0\n\u201cSteve,\u201d Eddie moans, wiping at his eyes. \u201cYou're killing me, man. Holy hell.\u201d He settles back down at Steve\u2019s side as the tape starts playing. \u201cIf I\u2019m gonna suffer through the next thirty minutes or something, then so will you. God, is this Toni Basil?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHey Mickey, you're so fine,\u201d Steve crows. \u201cYou fucking knew who she was, though!\u201d\u00a0\nEddie shoves Steve sideways, threatening to choke him out with a pillow. More than once Steve\u2019s fingers graze Eddie\u2019s bare thighs as they tustle, and more than once it sends his heart galloping about his ribcage. His cheeks hurt from how hard he\u2019s smiling, heart and head dizzy with affection. I like you so much, he thinks. It\u2019s much more comfortable to admit to himself than he ever thought possible. I like you, he thinks. I like Eddie Munson.\u00a0\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d Eddie sighs. \u201cNo, not  Wham!. Steve,  Steve \u2026  come on. Don\u2019t you love me?\u201d\nYeah, Steve thinks. \u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cTake it like a man, Munson. Wake me up before you go go, baby.\u201d\u00a0\nEddie rolls his head to the left. His smile is small and exasperated. \u201cSteve,\u201d he murmurs quietly, as if delivering bad news, \u201cI would  never.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cAsshole,\u201d Steve chokes out around his laughter.\u00a0\nEach song passes quicker than the next, bolstered by Eddie\u2019s critique. Steve\u2019s in stitches by the time Rupert Holmes\u2019s  Escape  fades out. The tape wheels stop spinning.\u00a0\n\u201cFinal thoughts?\u201d Steve asks, kicking Eddie\u2019s shin lightly. \u201cC\u2019mon, I saw you getting into that last one. If you like pi\u00f1a coladas and getting caught in the rain!\u201d\nEddie rolls his eyes. \u201cYou saw me praying to God, actually. Which, fat lot of good that guy is, given everything that happened to us this year.\u201d\u00a0\nSteve rolls onto his side, propping his head up on his hand. \u201cYou mean you didn\u2019t like bonding with a group of strangers through mortal peril and almost certain death?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s the plot of many D&amp;D campaigns,\u201d says Eddie, sagely, \u201cwhich you would know if you fucking showed up.\u201d He\u2019s grinning, though. He sits up and Steve follows. \u201cI guess it wasn\u2019t all bad. This past year, and the cassette.\u201d Eddie smiles down at his lap. \u201cAll things considered, senior year turned out a lot happier than I thought it would. I finally fucking graduated too, Jesus.\u201d He spins the ring on his middle finger round and round.\u00a0\nSteve\u2019s suddenly aware of the one on his thumb. He\u2019s taken to wearing it every day. At first, he\u2019d convinced himself it was only so he\u2019d be reminded to give it back. Now though, he knows why he never quite wanted to part with it. Still, it\u2019s a little unfair to Eddie.\n\u201cHey.\u201d Steve slides the ring off his thumb, sad to see it go. \u201cI keep forgetting to hand this back to you. I kinda stole it.\u201d He deposits it in Eddie\u2019s palm. \u201cSorry.\u201d\u00a0\nEddie thumbs at the ring, amused. He reaches out and catches Steve\u2019s hand in his, unaware of how Steve\u2019s heart stumbles over its natural rhythm. His hands are warm, big, calloused from years of guitar. Eddie digs his thumb gently into Steve\u2019s where the imprint of the ring still sits. Steve feels caught, like a trout on the end of a line. Their knees are touching. Eddie\u2019s thighs are tantalising. Steve wants wants\u00a0wants.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t steal it,\u201d says Eddie. \u201cI let you take it. Looked better on you, anyway. Totally badass.\u201d He slides the ring back onto Steve\u2019s thumb. \u201cWe need to do anything and everything we can to save you from looking like a prep, Stevie. Being a Wham! fan is bad enough.\u201d\nSteve\u2019s breath catches in his throat. \u201cShut up,\u201d he says, weakly.\u00a0He's caught up in how close they\u2019re pressed together.\nSteve\u2019s hand rests in Eddie\u2019s like he\u2019s delicate. No one has ever treated him this gently. When Eddie glances up, Steve realises they\u2019re mere inches apart. This close, Eddie\u2019s eyes are like a kaleidoscope of brown \u2014 chestnut, walnut, chocolate, and all the other shades Steve wants to research just to put a name to. They\u2019re so close together. Eddie doesn\u2019t move. His breath is a steady puff against Steve\u2019s skin, neck craned awkwardly. Steve wets his bottom lip and feels something hot and heavy and right settle into his gut. Eddie\u2019s hand is warm against his, and warmer still when Steve tugs it so that they\u2019re holding hands properly, entwined fingers and all.\u00a0\n\u201cSteve,\u201d Eddie murmurs, cautiously. His eyes are blown wide, stunned, and maybe a little hopeful.\u00a0\n\u201cI figured it out,\u201d says Steve, blood rushing around his body and to his head so fast he feels dizzy. \u201cWhy Dustin\u2019s matchmaking wasn\u2019t working \u2014 why it was pissing me off.\u201d\u00a0\nEddie sucks in a deep breath. Cautiously, he leans forward so their foreheads touch, just so. His hair is soft, smells distantly of smoke, and his breath is warm, so warm. Steve slides his free hand up Eddie\u2019s chest and presses it firmly to the smooth column of Eddie\u2019s neck. His fingers splay against Eddie\u2019s jaw.\n\u201cDustin kept pointing out all these girls. See, he was kinda on the right track. \u2018Cause I like girls and all, but I  really like brown eyes. Brown eyes and curly hair.\u201d Steve can\u2019t tear his gaze away from Eddie\u2019s mouth. \u201cPretty, too. I like when they wear jewellery, or eyeliner.\u201d Finally, Steve gives in and tugs at one of Eddie\u2019s curls. It's even thicker and softer than he thought it would be. \"I like when they make fun of me, just a little. I like when they bully me for enjoying ABBA, but play it in their car anyway.\"\nEddie sucks in a sharp breath. \u201cStevie,\u201d he says, voice catching. His gorgeous eyes are wide, pupils blown, completely shocked. \u201cYou better not be fucking with me, \u2018cause I\u2019ll sic Robin  and Dustin on you\u2014 probably Erica, too.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cGuess who else fits that description, Munson?\u201d Steve ploughs on. The air is thick with tension, Steve\u2019s heart threatening to fall out of his mouth, his palms kind of sweaty. \"I'll give you a hint,\" he murmurs, feeling reckless and brave and desperate. \"There's only one person who's ever let me blast\u00a0Waterloo outta their van.\"\u00a0\nEddie's eyes fall shut like he's steeling himself.\nSteve can't take it any longer. \u201cEddie,\u201d he implores, quietly.\u00a0\nEddie opens his eyes. He doesn\u2019t hesitate. He swoops forward that tiny distance, free hand cupping the back of Steve\u2019s neck and finally,  finally kisses him. A gentle, hesitant slide that Steve is soon addicted to. He presses closer, half-falling into Eddie\u2019s lap, and prods until Eddie\u2019s mouth falls open. Their kisses become wetter, quicker, more desperate, until Eddie falls back with a heaving breath.\n\u201cJesus H Christ,\u201d he gasps, shaking with laughter. \u201cFuck. They were  not kidding about that Harrington charm.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even get to give you a hickey,\u201d Steve complains, grappling to tug Eddie into his lap. \u201cC\u2019mon, man, lemme really give you the Steve Harrington experience.\u201d\u00a0\nEddie laughs, pink and pliant and pleased. His knees sprawl either side of Steve's lap. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna be a handful,\u201d he says. He\u2019s delighted, fingers warm under Steve's shirt, pressed just above the sensitive scars.\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve promises, smiling dopily. His hands drift down to squeeze Eddie's thighs, finally getting to touch purposefully. Eddie squirms a little, face red but self-satisfied.\n\"Thought you'd like these,\" he says. \"I wasn't even sure you were into guys but I figured I'd test the waters. It's hot as fuck, anyway.\"\u00a0\n\"You're hot as fuck,\" Steve mutters, swooping back in to kiss Eddie again. Eventually, they part, because it really is hot as hell.\u00a0\u201cSingles Club is cancelled. We just got an upgrade.\u201d\nEddie laughs, big doe eyes gleaming, happy in that way Steve\u2019s starting to associate with himself. \u201cBetter seal it with a kiss,\u201d Eddie says, batting his lashes theatrically.\u00a0\n\u201cC\u2019mere,\u201d Steve says, and he does.\u00a0"
