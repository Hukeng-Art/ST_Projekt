Any feedback you have is wildly appreciated, you have no idea.</p>\n<p>Just to give you guys an idea of what I'm doing: there will probably be anywhere from one to four more chapters in this fic.

    "text": "The first time Natasha meets Stark\u2019s kid, it\u2019s almost three in the morning. The tower is usually empty at this point; everyone\u2019s usually either asleep or pretending to be. Natasha\u2019s used to having the place to herself.\nBut the kitchen light is on. And there\u2019s a child sitting at the table.\nIt takes her a second to recognize the kid. He\u2019s straddling a chair, his hands clasped around a mug of steaming tea, his lips moving soundlessly as he stares at an open textbook in front of him. He\u2019s wearing a baggy, grey, long sleeved tee-shirt and a pair of fluffy Hello Kitty sweatpants.\nNatasha clears her throat.\nHe looks up in an instant, brown eyes wary and unsure. She places him as soon as she sees his face\u2014he\u2019s Stark\u2019s intern. She\u2019s never officially met him, but she\u2019s seen him around. He follows Stark around like a puppy dog, talking incessantly. She doesn\u2019t know that much about their relationship, but she\u2019s observant enough to know that he\u2019s got Stark wrapped around his little fingers.\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d he says, and he shuts the chemistry textbook hurriedly. His eyes are rimmed with red, but their wider than should be humanly possible. \u201cYou\u2019re the Black Widow.\u201d\nShe sizes him up, from the Hello Kitty sweatpants to the weird wrist guards that are strapped to his hands.\n\u201cNice pants,\u201d she says critically.\nHe glances down, and his face flushes. \u201cThanks,\u201d he says. \u201cMr. Stark gave them to me. Do you . . . want some tea, or something?\u201d\nNatasha raises her eyebrow, but doesn\u2019t respond. She moves over to one of the many, many drawers Stark has, pulling one open. The fake bottom is still there. Her secret stash of Hot Chocolate is still hidden in the place where she left it, safe from Clint. \nThe kid\u2019s mouth opens slightly. \u201cWhoa,\u201d he says. \u201cHow long has that been there?\u201d\nNatasha doesn\u2019t answer the question. \u201cIf you tell Tony, I\u2019ll . . .\u201d\nThe threat of castration dies in her throat, because his eyes are wide and earnest in a way that reminds her eerily of Steve. Also, he\u2019s just a kid.\nNatasha clears her throat. \u201cDon\u2019t tell Tony.\u201d\nThe kid bites his lip. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t lie to him,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I can\u2019t see it coming up in conversation, so your secret is safe with me.\u201d\nNatasha makes it just the way she likes it\u2014two packets of hot chocolate mix, \u00be mug of hot water, the rest cool so it doesn\u2019t burn her tongue. She adds two pumps of the creamer that Tony keeps by the counter. It tastes exactly like she remembers it.\nShe leaves without saying goodbye to the kid. It doesn\u2019t matter; his face is once again buried in his chemistry textbook. She\u2019s not sure if he even notices that she\u2019s gone.\n\u00a0\n___\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s left the compound by the time she wakes up the next morning, so she finds Stark instead. \nPeter isn\u2019t adding up. There\u2019s something off about him, something Natasha doesn\u2019t understand. And Natasha doesn\u2019t like to feel like she\u2019s in the dark.\nStark is in his lab, busy making edits to a new suit for the vigilantly that fought with them in Germany. Friday lets her in without much of a problem, which means that Stark is feeling more social than usual.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the deal with your kid?\u201d Natasha says bluntly as soon as she\u2019s inside the lab.\nTony doesn\u2019t look up from his computer screen. His eyes are bright behind his large glasses, and he looks better rested than she\u2019s seen him in a while.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been reading too many tabloids,\u201d Tony says absently. \u201cI don\u2019t have a kid.\u201d\n\u201cThen who was doing his homework in your kitchen last night?\u201d Natasha asks. \u201cAt three in the morning, might I add?\u201d\n Tony frowns, and a crease appears between his eyebrows.\n\u201cPeter? Why was he up at three?\u201d\nNatasha\u2019s looking for answers, not questions. \u201cWho is he? And why did he spend the night?\u201d\n\u201cHe interns for SI,\u201d Tony says, with the practiced air of someone who\u2019s been interviewing since childhood. \u201cCan you sit down? You\u2019re making me anxious, towering over me like that. Jesus.\u201d\n\u201cWhy did he spend the night?\u201d Natasha asks again, making no move to sit.\nTony finally looks up at her. \u201cThat\u2019s classified.\u201d\nTony Stark is hiding something important. Natasha knows all thirty-seven of his ticks, and right now he\u2019s preforming approximately fourteen of them. Her lips quiver suspiciously.\n\u201cHis voice sounds familiar,\u201d she says finally. \u201cDo I know him from somewhere?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve probably seen him around the tower before,\u201d Tony says. He goes back to his computer programming. \u201cHe talks a lot, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you have his voice stored in your mental files.\u201d\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t seem too chatty last night,\u201d Natasha says. \u201cAt least, on a scale from Bruce to Clint, he\u2019s a lot closer to Bruce.\u201d\n\u201cHe was probably just starstruck. Once you get to know him, you won\u2019t be able to get him to shut up if you try. And of course he\u2019s similar to Brucey Bear; Peter\u2019s incredibly smart,\u201d Tony says, and there\u2019s something that sounds like pride in his voice.\nNatasha raises an eyebrow. \u201cAre you saying Clint isn\u2019t?\u201d\n\u201cClint isn\u2019t smart, he\u2019s intelligent,\u201d Tony says absently. \u201cHe\u2019s a spy, I mean, of course he\u2019s intelligent. And Clint\u2019s self-preservation instincts are goals. Peter, unfortunately, is a little lacking in that department.\u201d\nNatasha doesn\u2019t know what to make of that statement.\n\u201cAnd you sent him on his merry way at seven in the morning?\u201d Natasha asks, checking her watch.\nTony shrugs. \u201cHe has school.\u201d\nNatasha leaves before she does something stupid, like water board Tony Stark until he answers all her questions. Because Tony can make interesting life decisions, but he\u2019s not a mentor. Who does he think he\u2019s kidding?\n(Of course, it\u2019s impossible to be an adult in Peter\u2019s life without instinctively trying to nurture him. But Natasha doesn\u2019t know that, yet.)\n\u00a0\n___ \n\u00a0\nThe next time she sees Peter, it\u2019s two in the morning, and he\u2019s once again studying in the kitchen.\nThis time its calc. Peter doesn\u2019t like calc. She can tell by the way he\u2019s chewing on his lip, his hands running through his hair every few seconds. \nNatasha isn\u2019t scientifically minded. Not like Stark or Bruce. But her instincts tell her something is off about the kid, so she runs an experiment.\nIt\u2019s a test, not attempted murder.\nAt a speed that only years of training could elicit, Natasha has her gun out and pointed at his head. He reacts quicker than she would\u2019ve thought possible. He\u2019s off his chair in an instant, calc textbook crashing to the floor. His wrist flicks, almost too quickly for her eyes to follow, and in a second the gun is out of her hands and stuck to the wall.\nThe kid is breathing heavily, staring at her with those wide, brown eyes. He\u2019s dropped into a defensive crouch, arms extended and eyes wary. He\u2019s stopped blinking.\nNatasha can\u2019t stop the corner of her lip from torqueing upwards. She decides she likes the kid after all.\n\u201cSo,\u201d she says smoothly, raising an eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019re Spiderman.\u201d\nThe kid is practically hyperventilating, staring at her with those damn eyes. \u201cYou . . . you . . .\u201d\n\u201cRelax,\u201d she says, heading over to her secret stash of cocoa. \u201cIf I wanted to kill you, you\u2019d be dead. Do you want some hot chocolate?\u201d\nShe thinks she can handle him, now. She can\u2019t really deal with children\u2014sometimes she feels like all her maternal instincts were removed with The Surgery. But she can deal with Spiderman, the hero who fought with her in Germany. \n\u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to find out,\u201d Peter wails, scooping his textbook up from the ground. The tips of his ears are bright red. \u201cMr. Stark specifically said . . . ooh, he\u2019s going to kill me.\u201d\nNatasha doesn\u2019t respond. It hurts, a little, just how much Stark doesn\u2019t trust her. But she gets it. She silently hands him a mug and melts her face into an impassive mask. \nPeter\u2019s shoulders set, as if he\u2019s bracing himself for a fight. \n\u201cI know what you\u2019re going to say,\u201d he says dully. \u201cI\u2019ve had this fight, with, like, one hundred different adults. Well, actually only two, but\u2014,\u201d\n\u201cI very much doubt that you know what I\u2019m going to say,\u201d Natasha says, sipping her hot chocolate calmly.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to say I\u2019m too young,\u201d Peter says bitterly. \u201cThat Mr. Stark was wrong to let me\u2014,\u201d\n\u201cI was younger than you, when I started out,\u201d Natasha says, tilting her head to one side. \u201cAnd I definitely wasn\u2019t helping firemen get cats out of trees.\u201d\nShe\u2019s seen the YouTube videos. \nPeter\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cI\u2019ll have you know that cat gave me a real run for my money.\u201d\nNatasha almost laughs.\nPeter smiles at her again, and opens his calc textbook back up. Natasha leaves as soon as her cup is finished. They don\u2019t speak again.\n\u00a0\n___\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s back in the kitchen almost a week later, this time at four thirty in the morning. His lip is split and both of his eyes are blackened, but he still manages to give her a genuine smile.\nHe\u2019s reading a book. Nonfiction, she thinks. It\u2019s about Georgia O\u2019Keef. Maybe he\u2019s just trying to keep her on her toes. She like to figure people out, and she can\u2019t do that if he\u2019s alternating between STEM textbooks and books about famous artists.\nShe makes him hot chocolate silently. She doesn\u2019t leave after she\u2019s finished this time, she just sits and watches him instead. She keeps expecting him to talk\u2014lord knows he talks enough around Stark, but he keeps his mouth shut and his head down.\n\u201cWhat happened to your face?\u201d she finally asks, breaking the silence.\n\u201cA couple of drug dealers thought they\u2019d make some trouble at a local bar,\u201d he says, and there\u2019s tension in his voice. \u201cI had it under control, Mr. Stark didn\u2019t have to . . .\u201d\nHe trails off, and his eyes flicker up to hers for a moment. She can see shame buried deep inside them.\nShe tilts her head to the side, wondering why he stopped talking.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t talk as much as I thought you would,\u201d she prompts. \u201cAt least, not around me.\u201d\nPeter looks up, surprised. \u201cI guess I just assumed you wouldn\u2019t want me to ramble. Also, you\u2019re, like, one of my heroes. And I have a really tough time filtering, so. Yeah. And\u2014,\u201d\n\u201cThere it is,\u201d she says dryly. \u201cLook who found his voice.\u201d\nPeter flushes. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you liked idle chitchat. Which is fine, I mean, obviously you have more important things to do, lots of people don\u2019t have time to just talk. I figured you were here for something.\u201d\n\u201cDo you want to talk?\u201d Natasha asks him, making sure to keep her face a mask of apathy.\nPeter flushes. \u201cYou sound like a therapist,\u201d he complains. \n\u201cIs that who you want me to be?\u201d she asks, because, for the life of her, she can\u2019t figure out who he is. He\u2019s socially awkward, but intelligent enough to know exactly how to react at any given time. He talks nonstop, but stays quiet if he doesn\u2019t think people want to hear what he has to say. He\u2019s a mystery, but seems to be a completely open book.\n\u201cDude, you don\u2019t want to be a therapist,\u201d Peter tells her. \u201cThey kind of got the shaft, you know? Because they have to go through a ton of school, but they can\u2019t even prescribe medicine, not like psychiatrists, you know? My friend MJ says she might want to be a therapist, but she gives really, really terrible advice, so\u2014,\u201d\nNatasha interrupts, because she\u2019s not entirely sure how to handle Peter. She\u2019s so used to having people figured out instantly that all this confusion is sitting in her gut like a lead ball.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t want me to listen, what do you want me to be?\u201d\nPeter closes the biography and meets her eyes. He looks as confused as she feels.\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\nShe hears the words, but doesn\u2019t quite comprehend them. What isn\u2019t there to understand?\nStark wanted a yessir, a badass woman who could help Pepper run his company while giving him something pretty to look at. Maybe that\u2019s not fair, because later he wanted something more intimate, a confident of sorts. Bruce wanted someone who loved him, who\u2019d still be there even when he was the other guy. Especially when he was the other guy.\nFury wanted a merciless superspy. Clint wanted a partner. \nSteve wanted a friend.\n\nWell, there\u2019s a chance you might be in the wrong business, Rogers.\n\n \u201cNo, I think I do understand,\u201d Peter says quietly. He\u2019s looking at her with something akin to pity in his eyes. \u201cI want you to be yourself.\"\nAnd Natasha leaves, because she\u2019s done with Peter Parker and her inability to figure him out.\nIt takes her about two weeks to figure out his schedule.\nFrom what she can gather, Peter works with Tony in the lab every Tuesday and Friday. He doesn\u2019t usually sleep over on Tuesdays, but he\u2019ll usually stay Friday nights. Every few weeks, he spends the weekend, leaving very early Monday morning. The only other nights he\u2019s in the tower, he\u2019s splattered with bruises and cuts, and the occasional broken bone. \nHis sleep schedule is more difficult to figure out. There are nights when they sit together from midnight to the morning, and also nights when she knows he\u2019s there but doesn\u2019t bother to show up at all. Natasha has trained herself to only need a few hours of rest here and there. She sometimes wonders what the kid\u2019s excuse is. He always looks tired, but he never seems to sleep.\nIt must be a spider thing.\nThey develop something like a system, although they never really discuss it. When Natasha wakes up, however early, she\u2019ll meet him in the kitchen and make them hot chocolate. Sometimes they talk. Occasionally, she helps Peter study. Usually, she reads quietly while he does homework or studies for Academic Decathlon. \nPeter is always there when she wakes up, though. As long as he\u2019s at the compound, he\u2019ll be there when she enters the kitchen at an ungodly hour of the morning.\nUntil one day, he isn\u2019t.\nShe knows he\u2019s staying the night\u2014it\u2019s a Friday night, after all. Natasha has been out all day, visiting Steve and Sam\u2019s apartment in Brooklyn. There\u2019d been some talk, earlier on, about everyone moving back into the compound. Natasha suspects it won\u2019t be long\u2014almost everyone is back in the tower at this point, save for the Captain and his number one. And, of course, Peter. As far as she knows, she\u2019s the only one who ever sees him. He\u2019s gone before the others wake up.\nMaybe she\u2019s too early, she thinks, checking her watch. Peter\u2019s always the first one out\u2014Natasha kind of assumed that he didn\u2019t sleep at all. She\u2019d Googled it, purely out of curiosity, and figured out that spiders don\u2019t typically sleep. She\u2019d figured it was some side effect of his bite.\nShe finds she misses the company, sitting alone in the kitchen with her hot chocolate. Natasha doesn\u2019t have friends, necessarily\u2014putting a word to shared feelings of affection is practically daring the universe to tear people apart. But she likes Peter and his strange mannerisms. She likes talking to him, or rather listening to him talk to her. \nShe pulls out a book and begins to wait.\nIt\u2019s about an hour before Peter stumbles into the room. His face is red and blotchy, his eyes are bloodshot. His hands are shaking.\nNatasha gets up in one quick motion and begins to make him hot chocolate. She lies her hand against the back of the kettle, waiting for the water to heat up. She bites her tongue, wanting to talk to him but not sure how.\nIf the roles were reversed, if she\u2019d stumbled in looking like she\u2019d seen a ghost, Peter would know exactly what to do. He\u2019d start rambling on, digressing into stories about his aunt and his best friends. Perhaps he\u2019d even tell her a story about his uncle. Peter doesn\u2019t talk about him much, but Natasha likes it when he does. His face lights up and his eyes sparkle, and he usually is laughing by the end of the story.\nNatasha doesn\u2019t have any stories that make her laugh like that.\nShe sets the mug of hot chocolate in front of him. \u201cDrink,\u201d she says.\nHe gives her a grateful smile but his eyes are dull in a way that she didn\u2019t think was possible.\n\u201cThe first time Clint ever called me Tasha, I Tasered him,\u201d Natasha says suddenly.\nPeter looks up at her, completely confused. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asks.\nNatasha bites her lip and turns away. She pours herself more hot chocolate, and pumps creamer into it.\n\u201cYou always tell me stories,\u201d she says, regretting the words. \u201cI . . . never mind. You seem upset.\u201d\nPeter looks at her, and a grin slowly spreads across his face. \u201cHow\u2019d Mr. Barton feel about getting Tased?\u201d\nTo tell the truth, he\u2019d pissed himself and spent the next six hours slurring his speech, but Natasha decides not to mention that part.\n\u201cHe was fine,\u201d she says smoothly. \n\u201cDo you not like being called Tasha?\u201d Peter asks curiously.\nHer fingers still over the kettle. \u201cI don\u2019t care very much about what people call me, to be honest. Clint just surprised me, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\u201cBut you\u2019re name isn\u2019t really Natasha, right?\u201d Peter says. \nHe\u2019s not asking in the way people usually ask. There\u2019s no suspicious or condescending undertone to his voice. He\u2019s just curious in his childlike, innocent way.\nAnd he doesn\u2019t look as upset as when he stumbled into the room, so. Her plan must be working to some extent.\n\u201cI\u2019ve gone by a lot of names,\u201d she says finally. \u201cThey all start to blur together, to be honest. Like I said, I don\u2019t really care what people call me.\u201d\n\u201cWhich one was your favorite?\u201d\nHonesty is hard for her, but it\u2019s never been a problem when she talks to Peter. She doesn\u2019t understand it.\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind Natasha, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know what to call you,\u201d Peter admits, staring at the floor. \u201cI\u2019d call you Ms. Romanov, but I know that some people think it\u2019s Romanovia, and I don\u2019t want to offend you or anything.\u201d\nNatasha\u2019s mouth twitches. It hasn\u2019t slipped her notice that he only calls her Ma\u2019am, or the occasional \u201cblack widow\u201d when he\u2019s talking about her to someone else.\n\u201cNat,\u201d she says finally, raising her mug to her lips. \u201cCall me Nat.\u201d\n___\n\u00a0\nThe next day, she corners Tony.\nHe won\u2019t let her into his lab\u2014Friday claims he\u2019s working on something important and cannot be interrupted. After waiting for him to take a break for almost three hours, Natasha ends up having to pull the fire alarm to get some face time with him.\nTony come out of his lab soaking wet from the sprinklers. Spluttering and cursing, he grabs the towel she silently hands him and throws her the middle finger.\n\u201cWhat the fuck, Romanov,\u201d he snarls. \u201cThere was no fire. You just drenched my tech for no goddamn reason.\u201d\n\u201cLanguage,\u201d she says, raising an eyebrow. \u201cAnd it wasn\u2019t for no reason. I think it\u2019s time we had a chat about your intern. Or, should I say, Spiderman.\u201d\nTony\u2019s eyes go wide. \nNatasha gives a small smile. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go sit down?\u201d she asks. \u201cI\u2019ll make us some hot chocolate?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Tony says. \u201cAbsolutely not. Is \u2018hot chocolate\u2019 spy talk for cyanide or something? How long have you known? How pissed are you? Who else knows? If you\u2019ve told anyone, I swear to god . . .\u201d\nShe\u2019s surprised by how much the accusation hurts her. It\u2019s not Tony\u2019s fault. He has no way of knowing the amount of time she\u2019s spent making sure that Peter Parker could never be connected to Spiderman. \nBecause, see, Spiderman hasn\u2019t exactly kept a low profile. There\u2019s a series of viral videos on the internet that all but confirm he\u2019s just a kid (the A-team challenge, she thinks they\u2019re called, but she\u2019s not sure. Sam told her about them at one point, but she\u2019s forgotten.) So she\u2019s spent hours bribing people in California and Delaware to swear they\u2019ve seen him, so that the incident in DC doesn\u2019t stand out. She\u2019s leaked false clues about his identity, deleted videos, and randomized data. She has dedicated at least a tenth of her life to guaranteeing Spiderman\u2019s secret identity will never see the light of day.\nTony doesn\u2019t know this, of course. But it hurts, she thinks, more than it should.\n\u201cYes. I leaked his identity to Ross,\u201d she says coolly.\nTony\u2019s eyes go wide, and in a second the iron man suit is half assembled around him.\n\u201cYou\u2014,\u201d\n\u201cRelax, I\u2019m joking,\u201d she says, not out of pity, but because she\u2019s genuinely afraid he\u2019s about to have a heart attack. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d\nTony lets out an exhale that sounds disturbingly similar to a wheeze. The iron man suit crumbles around him.\n\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d he says, and there\u2019s an edge to his voice that she hasn\u2019t heard before. \u201cJesus, Tasha, don\u2019t do that .\u201d\n\u201cSorry,\u201d she says, not sorry at all.\n\u201cHow long have you known?\u201d Tony asks, sinking down into a seated position against the wall, looking like he\u2019s readying himself for an argument.\n\u201cA couple of weeks,\u201d she tells him. She drops into a seated position next to him. Tony is the type of person who will reveal more when he is comfortable. \u201cWe hang out in the kitchen whenever he\u2019s here. He\u2019s a good kid.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean, whenever he\u2019s here?\u201d demands Tony. \u201cHe\u2019s always either in the medbay or in the labs\u2014,\u201d\n\u201cAt night,\u201d Natasha clarifies. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t sleep. Is it nightmares or insomnia?\u201d\nTony looks at her, perplexed. \u201cWhat do you mean, he doesn\u2019t sleep?\u201d\nNatasha raises her eyebrows. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I mean, well,\u201d Tony hesitates. \u201cHe never said . . . no. I had no idea.\u201d\n\u201cIt could be a side effect of the spider bite,\u201d Natasha says. \u201cWe should have Bruce take a look next time he\u2019s here. Do you know when that will be?\u201d\nTony glances at her, smirking. \u201cSubtle.\u201d \n\u201cI can kill you,\u201d she warns. \u201cI\u2019ll get away with it, too.\u201d\nTony laughs, and then pauses for a moment. \n\u201cHas he said anything to you about nightmares?\u201d he asks, almost nervously. \u201cI mean, of course he has nightmares, we\u2019re heroes, occupational hazard and all that. I just . . . I don\u2019t want him to have them.\u201d\nNatasha thinks about the dullness in Peter\u2019s eyes the previous night.\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\u201cDear god, he\u2019s turned you soft,\u201d Tony says, a look of amused disgust crossing his face. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be packing his lunchboxes and handing him tissues in no time.\u201d\n \u201cHe\u2019s a good kid,\u201d Natasha repeats. \u201cNot as much of a little asshole as those YouTube videos he created implied.\u201d\n\u201cThe A-team videos?\u201d Tony asks. \u201cYeah, that was a shitshow. Do you know how many people have accused me of becoming a soccer mom?\u201d\nNatasha eyes him, slumped against the wall with the dismantled iron man suit lying in pieces around him. \n\u201cHmm,\u201d is all she says.\n\u00a0\n___\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd obviously I had to use some sort of nylon/rubber polymer,\u201d Peter tells her, a manic glint in his eyes that reminds her eerily of Tony. He\u2019s pacing across the kitchen, hot chocolate mug lying forgotten on the table beside her. \u201cI wanted it to be able to stretch, but not too much or I\u2019d miscalculate and crash into the cement.\u201d\n\u201cDo you know what the chemical composition is for normal spider webs?\u201d asks Natasha smoothly.\nPeter waves a hand. \u201cNormal spiders don\u2019t weigh one hundred and twenty pounds. Even if I could\u2019ve increased the textile strength, chances are they couldn\u2019t hold up when I\u2019m swinging over Queens at fifty miles per hour.\u201d\n\u201cMakes sense,\u201d says Natasha, eying Peter over the top of her hot chocolate mug.\nHe sits down on his chair with a huff, turning his wide brown eyes onto her. \n\u201cI\u2019m boring you. Sorry, Nat.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be. It\u2019s interesting.\u201d\nHe reminds her of Bruce in a way that makes her heart ache a little. He has little bits and pieces of all of them, mashed up into a character that is completely his own. He has Steve\u2019s purity, Tony\u2019s intelligence, Bruce\u2019s passion. \nIt makes her miss having the team all living under one roof.\nPeter must see her expression flicker, because he pauses, staring at her.\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asks hesitantly.\n\u201cFine.\u201d\n\u201cYou sure?\u201d \n\u201cVery.\u201d\nPeter nods, and then turns around to make them both more hot chocolate. The clock on the stove lets her know that it\u2019s almost five in the morning. \n\u201cWhen do you leave for school?\u201d she asks.\nHe glances at the clock, frowning. \u201cIt takes about forty five minutes to get to Queens. I should probably leave at seven.\u201d\n\u201cI can drive you,\u201d she offers. \u201cI was planning to head into the city anyway.\u201d\nShe likes to visit Sam and Steve in Brooklyn every now and then.\nPeter\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d he asks. \u201cHappy would probably be . . . well . . . happy to not have to come out here to get me.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s no trouble.\u201d\n\u201cWhy are you going to Queens?\u201d\n\u201cBrooklyn, actually,\u201d she says, and then pauses. Peter\u2019s eyes are earnest; she\u2019s fairly certain that she could tell him anything, and he\u2019d never breathe it to another soul. \u201cI\u2019m trying to talk the rest of the rogue Avengers into moving back into the compound.\u201d\nPeter\u2019s back straightens, and his eyes go wide. \u201cDo you think they\u2019ll move back in? Oh my god, that would be incredible! How\u2019s it going?\u201d\n\u201cSlowly,\u201d she says, carefully taking a sip of the hot chocolate. \u201cVery slowly. I\u2019m working on it, but there\u2019s a lot of bad blood right now.\u201d\nPeter nods knowingly. \u201cBecause of Germany.\u201d\n\u201cNo, because Tony and Steve are self-righteous assholes who refuse to communicate with each other,\u201d Natasha says, careful to keep her voice light. Peter\u2019s eyes widen.\n\u201cWhy are they even mad at each other?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask Tony about that,\u201d Natasha says firmly. She\u2019s pulled security footage from the warehouse where everything went down between them. She knows what happened, and she\u2019s smart enough to make sure that the surveillance never sees the light of day. But it\u2019s not her place to tell Peter. \n\u201cDidn\u2019t they used to be best friends?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cThe media often exaggerates things,\u201d Natasha says mildly. \u201cYou should know that by now.\u201d\n\u201cBut they were close,\u201d he presses.\nNatasha purses her lips and drinks more hot chocolate.\n\u201cPeople can do bad things to each other, even if they don\u2019t mean to.\u201d she says finally. \u201cFriendship is irrelevant.\u201d\nPeter\u2019s eyes darken. \n\u201cWhen people do bad things, they always mean to,\u201d he tells her. \u201cWhether or not they\u2019re aware of it, they make a conscious decision.\u201d\n\u201cSounds like you have experience with that,\u201d Natasha says mildly.\nPeter shivers slightly, and then his million-dollar smile is back.\n\u201cI fight crime in Queens,\u201d he says. \u201cStuff happens. I\u2019ve seen it.\u201d\n\u201cYou have to hope for the best, but expect the worst,\u201d Natasha agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s a good way to survive.\u201d\n\u201cLife isn\u2019t just about survival, though,\u201d Peter says, his eyebrows creasing. \nGreat. Now he sounds like Steve.\n\u201cIt is if you want to stay alive,\u201d Natasha says.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of being alive if you don\u2019t live, though?\u201d \nNatasha grinds her teeth, hating that she doesn\u2019t understand what he\u2019s asking.\nShe gets the feeling Peter understands what he\u2019s saying perfectly, though. There\u2019s not a pretentious bone in his body.\n\u201cAre you ready?\u201d Natasha asks.\nSteve glances around the empty apartment and nods. Natasha puts a hand on his back and he leans into it for a second, closing his eyes and letting his head drop onto her shoulder. \n\u201cIf you guys could stop cuddling for a second and help me load these boxes into Clint\u2019s van, I\u2019d really appreciate that,\u201d says Sam, his voice strained. \u201cConsidering you\u2019re the one with super strength, Cap.\u201d\nThe Captain nods and takes the box from Sam, disappearing out the apartment door.\n\u201cSo we\u2019re really doing this,\u201d says Wanda distantly as Sam locks up the apartment for the last time. \u201cWe\u2019re all moving back into the compound. As if nothing happened.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Clint says, pulling his keys out of his pocket as they walk towards the elevator. \u201cYou guys are moving back into the compound. I\u2019m staying the hell away from your guys\u2019 shit show. I\u2019ve said it once, and I\u2019ll say it again: you guys are making a really big mistake.\u201d\n\u201cThanks, Clint,\u201d says Steve, his knuckles white against the moving box.\n\u201cRelax,\u201d Natasha says. \u201cYou\u2019re all overreacting. This isn\u2019t a big deal. We\u2019ve been moving towards it for weeks.\u201d\n\u201cEasy for you to say,\u201d says Sam. \u201cYou played both sides of the equation. No one\u2019s pissed at you because you\u2019re on everyone\u2019s team.\u201d\n\u201cAre you calling me a double agent?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Natasha says amenably. \u201cThat\u2019s fair.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re sure Tony\u2019s okay with this,\u201d says Steve, who\u2019s obviously not listening to a word anyone is saying. Sam opens the door for him, and he brushes by. \u201cYou\u2019re sure he doesn\u2019t mind us moving back in?\u201d\nNatasha tries not to think about the hour long screaming match she had with Tony less than six hours previously.\n\u201cTony knows it\u2019s what\u2019s best for the team.\u201d\n\u201cHas anyone ever told you you\u2019re quite good at dodging questions?\u201d asks Wanda, her tone uninterested.\n\u201cJust get in the van,\u201d Natasha tells everyone. \nIf she\u2019s being honest, she\u2019s not sure it\u2019s the right decision. But she\u2019s sure as hell going to make sure that if it goes sideways, the team comes out on top.\n\u00a0\n___\n\u00a0\nAs soon as they enter the communal floor, Natasha knows something is about to go wrong.\nShe can\u2019t sense anything off, but Steve immediately drops into a crouch, and they\u2019re all immediately on high alert. She can hear the TV playing in the living room, but the lights are out in the entry.\nSteve holds up a hand, gesturing for them all to stop.\n\u201cC\u2019mon, man,\u201d Sam hisses. \u201cIt\u2019s probably just Tony. We weren\u2019t supposed to arrive until tomorrow morning; he\u2019s not expecting us.\u201d\nSteve\u2019s face is impassive. \u201cThat\u2019s not Tony in there.\u201d\nThey slink over to the door as a group, the same way they trained. If Natasha wasn\u2019t on such high alert, she would think it was funny, the way they can all snap back into team-mode.\nSteve\u2019s hand closes around the doorknob.\n\u201cWe are the Avengers,\u201d whispers Wanda. \u201cWhoever is in there, we can take. Why are you going so slowly?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m with Sam,\u201d says Clint. \u201cIt\u2019s a Friday night, Tony\u2019s probably just watching a movie with Rhodes.\u201d.\nFriday night.\nThe panic hits Natasha before she\u2019s even put two and two together. \u201cWait, Steve, don\u2019t\u2014,\u201d\nSteve throws the door open.\nNatasha realizes in hindsight how it must look to them. A teenage kid, no older than sixteen, sitting on the couch in front of the TV eating a bowl of cereal. It stops every single one of them dead in their tracks.\nPeter is frozen too, staring at them with his spoon halfway to his mouth. His eyes are wider then Natasha has ever seen them, which is saying something.\nEveryone stands in shocked silence for about ten seconds before Peter finally speaks.\n\u201cUm, hi,\u201d he says. \u201cWow. You guys are the Avengers.\u201d\n\"What the fuck,\u201d Sam says. \u201cWhat the fuck.\u201d\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to get here until tomorrow morning,\u201d says Peter, carefully putting his spoon back in his bowl. He\u2019s breathing heavily. \n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d asks Steve, his voice dangerously low. \nPeter\u2019s eyes are so wide that Natasha is genuinely worried that his face might break. \n\u201cI live here?\u201d\n\u201cYou live here,\u201d Clint repeats disbelievingly. \n\u201cWell, not permanently,\u201d Peter hastens to explain. \u201cMy aunt is working at a hospital in New Jersey this weekend, so I\u2019m staying here.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what are you doing here, exactly?\u201d demands Sam, his fingers wrapped a little too tightly around his gun for Natasha\u2019s liking.\nPeter frowns. \u201cI\u2019m . . . eating cereal?\u201d\nPeter glances at her with a mixture of panic and wonder, and Natasha is broken out of her stupor.\n\u201cThis is Peter,\u201d she says, firmly putting herself between him and the rogues. \u201cPeter, meet Sam, Steve, Clint, Wanda.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve met,\u201d says Wanda, smiling slightly at Peter. \u201cHow\u2019s MJ?\u201d\n\u201cGirl, don\u2019t even,\u201d says Peter. \u201cShe never shuts up about you, I swear to god. It legitimately hurts my feelings\u2014,\u201d\n\u201cPeter,\u201d calls Tony from the kitchen, and Natasha feels her gut wrench as the situation goes from bad to worse. \u201cWhy is the box of Sugar-O\u2019s on the counter?\u201d\n\u201cI felt like cereal,\u201d Peter calls back, not taking his eyes off the Rogues.\n\u201cWhen you said you were going to get dinner, I thought you meant, like, pizza or some shit,\u201d Tony says, entering the living room, his eyes fixed on Peter. \u201cYou do realize you\u2019re essentially eating pure\ncane sugar, right?\u201d\n\u201cI put some skittles in there, too,\u201d Peter says. \u201cBalanced diet, and all that.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know how to respond to that,\u201d Tony fumes. \u201cCongratulations, you have officially rendered me speechless. I thought you were supposed to be a child prodigy, how could you possibly think that\u2014\u201d\n\u201cTony,\u201d Natasha says, genuinely worried about the rogues\u2019 brains short circuiting.\nTony slowly spins on his heel, coming face to face with the Rogue Avengers for the first time in months.\nThe room goes deadly silent.\n\u201cYou\u2019re early,\u201d Tony says finally. \u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to get here until tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I said,\u201d says Peter through a mouthful of skittles and cereal. \u201cThey didn\u2019t seem to care.\u201d\n\u201cPeter,\u201d says Tony, his voice deadly and low. \u201cI think I left my phone in the lab. Can you please go get it for me?\u201d\nPeter frowns. \u201cI\u2019m eating cereal.\u201d\nTony grits his teeth, his eyes fixed firmly on the Rogues. \u201cSo put it down and finish it later.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019ll get soggy.\u201d\n\u201cPeter, please.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a sharp edge to his voice that Natasha rarely hears. Peter carefully nods and makes a beeline for the door without further protest.\nHe pauses in the doorway, glancing back at the Rogues.\n\u201cIt was really nice to meet you guys,\u201d he says. His tone shakes slightly, but his eyes contact is firm. \u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot about you.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s funny,\u201d says Clint, tilting his head to one side. \u201cBecause we haven\u2019t heard anything about you.\u201d\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s going to stay that way,\u201d says Tony quietly. \u201cPeter, phone.\u201d\nPeter turns on his heel and disappears.\nA heavy silence falls through the room again. \n\u201cThis was one of your better ideas, Tasha,\u201d says Tony, the same bitter edge to his voice. \u201cNo, seriously, locking all of us in a building together? Fantastic. What could possibly go wrong?\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to fight you anymore, Tony,\u201d says Steve quietly. \u201cWe\u2019re past that.\u201d\nTony\u2019s jaw clenches. \u201cAnd the Winter Soldier?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone,\u201d says Natasha firmly. \u201cHe\u2019s off the grid. Somewhere safe. He\u2019ll get in touch with Steve when he\u2019s ready. He won\u2019t be stopping by for family movie night, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking.\u201d\nTony nods jerkily. \n\u201cI have to go,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m sure you guys remember the layout of the place?\u201d\nTony doesn\u2019t wait for an answer. He follows Peter down to the lab, grabbing the discarded bowl of cereal on his way out.\n\u00a0\n___\n\u00a0\nNatasha finds Peter in the kitchen later that night, sometime between two and three. He\u2019s staring transfixed at an open dell processer in front of him. She silently makes the both hot chocolate and sets the steaming mug in front of him. \n\u201cThanks,\u201d he says, smiling at her with bloodshot eyes.\nNatasha frowns. \u201cHow long have you been awake?\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t gone to sleep yet,\u201d he admits. \u201cWe were in the lab until midnight, and I have a ten page research paper on the molecular biology of cellular reparation due Monday. I just started it.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s poor planning.\u201d\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s high school,\u201d Peter says, grinning. \u201cMidtown, to be exact. They take a bunch of kids with an A plus average, make the new average a C, and have them battle for 4.0s in a way that makes the Hunger Games look like a pep rally.\u201d\nNatasha raises her eyebrows.\n\u201cThe essay is extra credit,\u201d clarifies Peter. \u201cI flunked a test on naming acids.\u201d\n\u201cThat seems like the kind of thing you\u2019d be really good at,\u201d Natasha says.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t study,\u201d Peter explains. \u201cI meant to, I just forgot. That\u2019s the life of a part time vigilante for you.\u201d\n\u201cYou should prioritize sleep over school, and school over Spiderman,\u201d Natasha tells him.\n\u201cYou sound like May,\u201d he complains.\n\u201cThere are worse people to sound like.\u201d\n\u201cTrue,\u201d Peter says, smiling slightly. \u201cMay is the best. I honestly don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without her.\u201d\n\u201cYou guys are close?\u201d asks Natasha, more as a prompt than a question.\n\u201cYeah, we\u2019re tight,\u201d Peter says. \u201cI think it throws a lot of people, because we\u2019re not even related biologically, you know? Ben was my dad\u2019s best friend. There were people who thought that, after Ben died, she was going to release custody to the state. But she\u2019d never; she\u2019s not like that. She\u2019s a really good person.\u201d\nNatasha raises her eyebrows at the faux-casual tone.\n\u201cIs that what you thought she\u2019d do?\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have blamed her,\u201d says Peter. He smiles, trying to pass it off as a joke, but the look in his eyes is too intense. \u201cI\u2019ve put her through a lot over the years, you know? She and Ben were never even planning on having kids.\u201d\n\u201cThe right choice is usually unplanned.\u201d\n\u201cLike what?\u201d Peter asks eagerly, leaning forward. \nNatasha pauses, looking into Peter\u2019s wide eyes. She realizes with a pang that she can\u2019t leave him hanging now, not into the midst of whatever existential crisis he\u2019s having. Natasha chews her lip, sorting through all the stories she can tell him. Most of her life experiences are too fucked up to put on the shoulders of a teenager, super strength be damned.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she says finally. \u201cHere\u2019s an example. I\u2019m not sure if you know this or not, but a couple of years ago we dumped all of Shield\u2014and Hydra\u2019s\u2014Intel onto the web.\u201d\nPeter nods emphatically. \u201cOh, yeah. I remember that. We studied a lot of it in government last year. It was super interesting, even if it was hard to understand.\u201d\n\u201cI was never intending to have all my covers blown,\u201d says Natasha distantly, and suddenly she\u2019s back in that building, dumping all the files online while Alexander Pierce goads her. \u201cI\u2019d spent decades making sure that information never saw the light of day, and then suddenly, out of the blue, I was releasing it for the whole world to see.\u201d\nPeter\u2019s eyes are burning with curiosity. \u201cWhy\u2019d you do it, then?\u201d\nNatasha stares into the distance. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d\nPeter leans foward. \u201cIn my experience that either means you don\u2019t know, or you don\u2019t want to tell me.\u201d\nNatasha laughs softly. \u201cNo. It really is complicated. I think in the end, I leaked those files because it was the right thing to do, and it was what Steve wanted. Leaking my life\u2019s work was just a means to an end. Lives were at stake.\u201d\n\u201cBut you don\u2019t regret it,\u201d says Peter eagerly. \u201cIt was unplanned, but it was for the best?\u201d\n\u201cIt was the right thing to do,\u201d Natasha says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m thankful I made the choice, even if I\u2019m now officially too famous to do anymore undercover work.\u201d\n\u201cYou miss being undercover?\u201d\nNatasha meets his eyes. They stare back at her, wide and earnest.\n\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily miss the undercover ops. But I miss being sure of my identity.\u201d\n\u00a0\n___\n\u00a0\nWhen Natasha enters the kitchen in the morning, Steve, Sam, and Clint are staring transfixed at Peter while he pours batter into a waffle iron.\n\u201cMy research paper on the molecular biology of cellular reparation is due Monday,\u201d Peter is telling them animatedly. \u201cI wanted to do starfish, you know, because they\u2019re the obvious choice.\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d says Sam, staring at him in confusion. \u201cSo obvious, don\u2019t you think, Steve.\u201d\nSteve doesn\u2019t look like he knows how to respond.\n\u201cI guess lizards would be a good choice, too, because they can regrow their tails,\u201d Peter explains. \u201cBut I figure every other kid who\u2019s writing the essay is going to pick one of those two options, so I\u2019m thinking about writing it about what kind of tech it would take for humans to be able to do it. I mean think about it, if we had that kind of tech we could revolutionize modern medicine\u2014,\u201d\nClint leans over to her, his eyes wide.\n\u201cI thought I was the only Avenger with kids,\u201d he whispers.\n\u201cI think Scott has a daughter,\u201d Natasha says, pouring herself coffee. \u201cKaty, right? No, Cassie.\u201d\nClint gives her a dirty look. \u201cYou could\u2019ve told me. They\u2019re so similar, Tasha. I mean, Jesus.\u201d\n\"Wait,\" says Natasha, stopping in her tracks. \"You actually think that-,\"\n\u201cHey, Nat,\u201d says Peter, looking up from the waffle iron for the first time. \u201cDo you want a waffle? I think Mr. Stark has some whipped cream, and I have skittles and gummy bears to add flavor and texture.\u201d\nSam and Steve exchange a confused look.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I like waffles,\u201d Natasha says. \u201cI\u2019ve never had one.\u201d\n\u201cPro tip,\u201d say Clint. \u201cThis kid is a psychopath. Do not, under any circumstances, put skittles or gummy bears anywhere near that batter.\nPeter holds out a plate to her.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll never know unless you try,\u201d he tells her.\nNatasha hesitates, then takes the plate from him.\n(They\u2019re not cooked through, and they burn the hell out of her tongue. It\u2019s still the best thing she\u2019s ever tasted.)\nSaturday night, Natasha sleeps longer than usual. It\u2019s probably the stress of the move, she thinks, but it\u2019s distressing nonetheless. She normally can only get an hour at a time\u2014two, if nothing happens to wake her up\u2014but she sleeps for almost four.\nWhen she finally stumbles out into the kitchen at almost three in the morning, Peter is asleep too. He\u2019s sprawled over his math textbook, a pencil still clutched in his hand. His mouth is open slightly, and his hair is messier than she\u2019s ever seen it. She reaches out for a moment, wanting to ruffle it up, but she decides against it at the last moment and grabs his empty mug to disguise the movement.\n\u201cSmooth,\u201d says Clint from behind her.\nNatasha whirls around, her fingers resting on the gun in her waist band. Clint raises his eyebrows at her before sweeping past her to pour himself a cup of coffee.\n\u201cYou should know better than to sneak up on me,\u201d Natasha says, but she\u2019s almost smiling. She\u2019s missed him.\n\u201cYou\u2019re losing your touch,\u201d is all Clint says, but he\u2019s smiling too.\nShe turns her gaze back to Peter and her hands unclench. He\u2019s undisturbed by the exchange happening between them. It\u2019s almost funny; she would\u2019ve pegged him for a light sleeper.\n\u201cHe\u2019s cute,\u201d says Clint. \u201cToo smart for his own good, if you ask me.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing no one\u2019s asking you, then.\u201d\nClint looks at her in shock. Even Natasha is a little surprised by the edge that creeps into her voice. She pauses for a minute, pouring herself a cup of coffee before sliding into the seat across from Peter.\n\u201cIt sometimes scares me a little,\u201d she admits quietly, pressing her palms into her mug. \u201cHow smart he is, I mean.\u201d\nClint smirks, glancing between her and Peter. \u201cCome on, Tasha. We both know that\u2019s not what\u2019s really scaring you.\u201d\nHe slides into the seat beside her, poking her shoulder gently.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a mom,\u201d he says gleefully.\nNatasha shoves him off the chair, grabbing him before he hits the floor so the thud doesn\u2019t wake Peter.\n\u00a0\n___\n\u00a0\nPeter is still asleep an hour later, long after Clint has exited to go for a run. Natasha stays with him, drinking her hot chocolate and reading one of the books he\u2019s left lying around. It\u2019s a fiction work, and she suspects that it belongs to his friend MJ, judging by the notes scrawled in the margins.\nPeter jerks awake suddenly.\nHe goes from a motionless to high alert in about half a second. He practically jumps onto the ceiling, breathing heavily. It\u2019s so unexpected that Natasha instinctively pulls a gun out of her pants, every sense in her body triggered instantly.\nPeter\u2019s hand slips off the ceiling, and he comes crashing down in a heap onto the table. It makes an annoyed creaking noise, but it doesn\u2019t break. Peter slides onto the floor in a heap, and in a second Natasha is kneeling next to him.\nHe shoves her hands away. \u201cI\u2019m fine. It\u2019s okay.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not fine. His pupils are dilated and he\u2019s breathing heavily. Natasha takes a step back, out of his personal space, and begins to make him hot chocolate as fast as she possibly can.\nShe\u2019s not the type of person who can engage in an emotional heart-to-heart about nightmares, but she can make a half-decent cup of cocoa. The thought makes her set down the mug a little harder than she intended to, and it cracks along the bottom.\nIt\u2019s not a problem. Tony has dozens of mugs. One breaks, and it can easily be replaced.\nThey\u2019ve both calmed down by the time Natasha turns around to hand the mug to Peter. He\u2019s sitting at the table again, but his hands are shaking when he reaches out to take the mug from her.\n\u201cThank you, Nat,\u201d he says quietly.\nNatasha gives him a tight smile.\nThey drink the hot chocolate in silence for a few minutes, neither knowing exactly what to say. Peter\u2019s hands are loosely draped around his mug, purposefully relaxed to avoid accidently crushing it. Natasha\u2019s knuckles are white, they\u2019re gripping it so tight.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Peter says finally, not looking at her. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to freak you out.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to talk,\u201d Peter says hurriedly, not meeting her eyes. \u201cNot if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d\nNatasha doesn\u2019t respond for a few minutes. When she finally does, her voice is light.\n\u201cI think that Bruce should take a look at you the next time he\u2019s here.\u201d\nIt\u2019s almost comical, the way Peter\u2019s jaw immediately drops at the name. \u201cBruce? You mean Bruce Banner? Dr. Bruce Banner? Why?\u201d\nNatasha raises an eyebrow, but she can\u2019t stop a small smile from flicking across her face.\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine you get much sleep,\u201d she says finally. \u201cBruce should run some tests, and see if it\u2019s something to do with the spider bite. We can figure something out from there.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Peter says instantly. His eyes go right back down to the table. \u201cI don\u2019t need to run any tests. It\u2019s not because of the spider bite. I\u2019ve never needed much sleep. It\u2019s always been this way, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\nNatasha forces her face into an expressionless mask. Of course she\u2019s going to worry, what kind of heartless bastard does he perceive her as? \n\u201cIf you say so,\u201d is all she says.\n\u00a0\n___\n\u00a0\nEveryone eats breakfast together the next day.\nIt\u2019s completely unplanned. It just kind of happens; Peter is making pancakes in the kitchen, and one by one people trickle in and accept the heaping plates he offers.\nIt\u2019s funny, watching Steve and Sam poke at the gummy bears in the pancakes with bemused expressions on their faces. Clint, who is used to his kids\u2019 experimenting in the kitchen, declares them the best pancakes he\u2019s ever had, but it doesn\u2019t slip Natasha\u2019s notice that he refuses seconds. Wanda insists on making eggs, and suddenly it\u2019s an actual meal that they\u2019re all eating in the same room.\nTony stumbles in at half past nine. He looks around the kitchen with his eyebrows raised; from Steve and Sam playing cards to Wanda frying eggs to Peter sitting cross legged on the counter. \n\u201cTell me this is a dream,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is so fucking domestic, I don\u2019t think I can handle it.\u201d\n\u201cHey, Mr. Stark,\u201d says Peter, smiling cheerfully at him. \u201cI made pancakes. Do you want some?\u201d\nTony eyes the melted gummy bears sticking out of Steve\u2019s half-eaten pancakes.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cDefinitely not.\u201d\n\u201cYou should have breakfast,\u201d Peter says. \u201cIt\u2019s the best meal of the day!\u201d\n\u201cCoffee,\u201d Tony says, running a hand through his hair. He blinks sleepily at Natasha, who offers him a small smile. \u201cCoffee is breakfast.\u201d\n\u201cI made you one of those disgusting fluffy coffees you like,\u201d Peter says, pointing. \u201cIt\u2019s in the stasis chamber.\u201d\nTony doesn\u2019t look like he knows how to respond. He looks at Natasha, completely confused, and she just shrugs.\nSam pulls it out and hands it to him silently.\n\u201cWow,\u201d says Tony. \u201cWow. Thanks, kid. You\u2019re officially my favorite person in the world.\u201d\n\u201cWould you mind telling that to Rhodey? Because\u2014,\u201d\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d Clint whispers to Natasha. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can handle this.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t make me shove you again,\u201d Natasha warns him.\nTony sits down on the counter beside Peter, throwing on a pair of sunglasses and chugging half the coffee in one sip.\n\u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t wear those pants,\u201d says Tony. \u201cIt makes me feel like an asshole.\u201d\nPeter glances down at the Hello Kitty sweatpants. \u201cThey\u2019re so fluffy, though!\u201d he says.\n\u201cUm, storytime?\u201d says Sam. \u201cWhat\u2019s the deal with the pants, Pete?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not important,\u201d says Tony smoothly. \u201cSo. What have you guys been up to?\u201d\nThe words are carefully cool. There\u2019s no bitterness behind them, but there\u2019s still that edge to his voice that Natasha is beginning to think will always be there.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been lying low, mostly,\u201d says Steve.\nThe kitchen lapses into an awkward silence.\n\u201cSo,\u201d says Clint. \u201cHow\u2019s school going, Peter?\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d says Peter, sprinkling more gummy bears over his pancakes. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty boring. You know.\u201d\n\u201cOh, come on,\u201d says Sam, grinning. \u201cYou\u2019re in high school, right? You must have some interesting drama for us. Have you got a girlfriend, or something?\u201d\n\u201cSam!\u201d says Steve.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear about this,\u201d says Tony. \u201cIt\u2019s too early in the morning, the coffee hasn\u2019t hit my bloodstream yet\u2014,\u201d\nWanda begins to open her mouth, and Peter tries his best to glare at her.\n\u201cI did,\u201d says Peter before she can say anything, his hand back in the gummy bear bag. \u201cBut I got in a really bad fight with her dad; he wasn\u2019t exactly my biggest fan. He subtly tried to kill me like four different times. Then he turned out to be, like, a legit criminal who went to prison, and she moved to Oregon.\u201d\nThe room goes quiet again.\n\u201cDating has really changed since I was young,\u201d says Steve thoughtfully.\n\u201cOnly Tony Stark\u2019s kid,\u201d Sam mutters. \u201cI just need to, like, stop asking questions. I do not want to know.\u201d\n\u201cI feel like that\u2019s going to be you as a dad, when your daughters get that old,\u201d Natasha tells Clint.\n\u201cWow,\u201d says Clint. \u201cThanks.\u201d\nClint glances over at Tony and raises an eyebrow.\n\u201cAnd you were totally okay with all that going down? Like, you didn\u2019t try to step in or anything?\u201d\n\u201cIf it were my kid, I wouldn\u2019t have let him anywhere near a girl\u2019s family without a complete background check to everyone in the apartment complex,\u201d agrees Sam.\nTony\u2019s eyes shift over to Natasha\u2019s, and she can see the panic in his eyes.\n\nDo they know about Spiderman?\n\nShe shakes her head, almost unnoticeably, and relief flashes across his face. Almost instantly, his million-dollar smile is back.\n\u201cLike I could\u2019ve intervened if I\u2019d tried,\u201d Tony says. \u201cYou know how kids are. They do whatever they want.\u201d\nRight after breakfast, Peter and Tony head to the lab. Almost immediately, Natasha is cornered by Clint. \nHe waits a few seconds after she exits the kitchen, then follows her back to her room, just like he used to do while they were undercover. She can sense him behind her, following at a reasonable distance, and she leaves her door open a crack and settles herself onto her desk chair.\nHe sits on her bed, pulling out an arrow and beginning to fix the broken tip. She watches him carefully, waiting for him to speak.\n\u201cSo,\u201d he says finally. \u201cStark has a kid. Who would\u2019ve thought?\u201d\nNatasha\u2019s tempted to tell him the truth, because she really hates lying to him. Natasha doesn\u2019t lie to Clint, at least, not when she can avoid it. He\u2019s never lied to her, not in all the years she\u2019s known him. It\u2019s why they\u2019re such good partners.\nBut this secret isn\u2019t hers. It\u2019s Peter\u2019s.\n\u201cStark is definitely more paternal than I expected,\u201d Natasha agrees. It\u2019s not a lie. \n\u201cWhat happened to his mom?\u201d asks Clint, turning the arrow over in his hands and inspecting it for damage.\n\u201cDead.\u201d\n\u201cBut he doesn\u2019t live with Tony full time?\u201d\n\u201cHis aunt has custody.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s his mom\u2019s sister, I assume.\u201d Clint says, pulling another arrow out of his quiver.\n \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask him?\u201d\n \u201cCome on, Tasha,\u201d says Clint pleadingly. \u201cGive me something. I know you, you\u2019ve probably done a full background check on anyone who\u2019s ever come into contact with that kid. Surely you\u2019ve dug up some dirt for me.\u201d\n\u201cHis neighbor\u2019s florist didn\u2019t pass my polygraph, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking.\u201d\nClint rolls his eyes at her, pulling out another arrow and beginning to make adjustments to the feathers. \n\u201cWhy was he in the kitchen with you at, like, three in the morning?\u201d\nNatasha shrugs evasively. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t sleep much. Neither do I.\u201d\nClint gives her a look of disgust. \u201cHe had hot chocolate in front of him. I\u2019m not an idiot, I know you must\u2019ve showed him where your secret stash is. How\u2019d he get it out of you, blackmail or bribery? I\u2019ve known you for most of my life, and you\u2019ve never\u2014\u201d\n\u201cListen,\u201d says Natasha. \u201cDrop it, Clint. You don\u2019t want to push Tony when it comes to Peter. You don\u2019t want to push me, either, for that matter. I don\u2019t want to have to lie to you.\u201d\nClint looks at her carefully. He\u2019s smarter than people give him credit for. When they worked for SHIELD, people were constantly underestimating him, partly because of his reputation as her sidekick, partly because his personality is that of an immature child. People sometimes forget how dangerous he is.\nNatasha will never forget. It\u2019s one of the reasons she likes him so much.\n\u00a0\n___\n\u00a0\nFriday lets Natasha into the lab without a problem. The pop music that\u2019s blasting through the speakers dulls to a quiet backdrop as she enters, and she\u2019s immensely grateful.\nShe raises her eyebrows at Tony, who points to Peter.\n\u201cHis music,\u201d he says quickly. \u201cNot mine.\u201d\n\u201cHey, Beyonc\u00e9 is queen,\u201d says Peter, his hands completely submerged in a clear liquid that\u2019s frothing dangerously.\n\u201cDo I even want to know?\u201d asks Natasha, eyeing the substance suspiciously.\n\u201cHe got stuck in his own web fluid,\u201d says Tony, pausing from his computer coding to send her a smirk. \u201cDumbass.\u201d\nPeter pouts. \u201cHe won\u2019t help me get out.\u201d\nNatasha sends Tony a disapproving look, her eyebrows raised.\n\u201cThe first rule of working in my lab is that if you do dumb shit, I\u2019m not going to bail you out,\u201d says Tony absently, returning to his laptop. He frowns slightly, deleting a significant chunk of code, and his eyes narrowing.\n\u201cIt will disintegrate in between two and ten hours; I don\u2019t know much about the tweaked formula. Don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d says Peter, smiling at her. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Nat?\u201d\n\u201cWe need to talk about the team,\u201d Natasha says, pulling out a stool and sitting down by Peter.\n\u201cDo you need to talk to Mr. Stark alone?\u201d Peter asks, his eyes widening. \u201cI can leave. Actually, no I can\u2019t, because I\u2019m stuck to this table, but\u2014,\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s about you,\u201d says Natasha. \u201cI want to know if guys are planning on telling the team about Spiderman.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d says Tony firmly, his fingers flying over his keyboard. \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d\nNatasha tilts her head to one side, looking at Peter instead. \u201cYou can trust them, Peter. We\u2019re all on the same team.\u201d\nPeter frowns slightly. \u201cSix months ago, you guys were all trying to kill each other.\u201d\nNatasha supposes that\u2019s a pretty fair point.\nTony smirks slightly as he balances the laptop on his lap, feel propped up on a table. \u201cIs there a reason why you\u2019re so eager to expose the kid?\u201d \nNatasha considers him for a second. He looks better rested then she\u2019s seen him in months. His hair is smoothed up, his goatee is freshly shaved, and he\u2019s not wearing those stupid tinted glasses. He looks so different from the man she met years ago, the narcissistic hero dying from blood poisoning. \nThe memories make Natasha pause.\n\u201cSecrets have a way of coming out eventually,\u201d she says finally. She looks at Peter, her hands curling around the edge of the table. \u201cWhether or not the team acts like it, they\u2019re some of the most intelligent people I\u2019ve ever met. I just want to make sure you\u2019re prepared for them figuring it out sooner rather than later.\u201d\nPeter\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cDo you think they suspect that I\u2019m Spiderman?\u201d\nTony\u2019s head snaps to attention, his eyes narrowed.\nNatasha pauses. \u201cThey know you\u2019re not just an intern.\u201d\n\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d demands Stark.\n\u201cThe current theory is that he\u2019s yours,\u201d Natasha says coolly, meeting Stark\u2019s gaze. \u201cBiologically, I mean.\u201d\nThe laptop on Starks lap crashes to the floor. Peter lets out a string of incoherent babble that falls somewhere between expletives and laughter. Stark stares at her, his broken laptop in pieces at his feet.\n\u201cYou\u2019re fucking with me,\u201d is all he says, his eyes drifting over to Peter.\nPeter buries his face in his hands, ignoring the web fluid covering them.\n\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t correct them?\u201d Tony demands, kicking the mangled corpse of his laptop under the table.\nNatasha raises an eyebrow. \u201cTrust me,\u201d she says. \u201cYou don\u2019t want them poking around trying to figure out why an intern spends weekends at Avengers tower.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t spend every weekend here,\u201d says Peter, his voice muffled by the web fluid. \u201cJust when May\u2019s out of town.\u201d\nTony tosses his broken laptop back onto the table with a little more force than necessary.Natasha purses her lips.\n\u201cWhat do you want me to tell them?\u201d \n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Tony says flatly, glancing at Peter. \u201cI guess I\u2019ve got a kid now.\u201d\n\u201cCongratulations,\u201d Natasha deadpans.\n \u201cI\u2019m not calling you dad,\u201d says Peter firmly, his forehead still stuck to his hands. \u201cI draw the line there.\u201d\nNatasha lets her face fall into an expressionless mask to keep herself from laughing. \u201cYou could just let me tell them the truth,\u201d she offers. \nPeter and Tony exchange a look. Neither of them respond, but they don\u2019t have to. Natasha knows exactly what they\u2019re thinking.\n \u201cThey\u2019ll figure it out eventually,\u201d she can\u2019t stop herself from warning them. She already has seventeen different plans for what to do if when that day comes, but they don\u2019t have to know that.\n\u00a0\n___\n\u00a0\nWhen Natasha enters the kitchen at approximately one in the morning, Peter is flipping through a science textbook slightly manically.\nHis hands are shaking when he accepts the cup of hot chocolate from her, but his smile is soft. \n\u201cRough night?\u201d she asks quietly.\n\u201cI can\u2019t figure out how to keep webs sticky enough to hold wounds together while preventing them from being toxically acidic,\u201d he says dully. \n\u201cIt might be easier to work if you got some sleep,\u201d Natasha says, faintly amused. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be self-destructive to be a superhero.\u201d\nPeter rolls his eyes. \u201cFunny,\u201d he deadpanned. \u201cOn the job application, it said it was a requirement.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s an occupational hazard, not necessarily a requirement,\u201d Natasha corrects. \u201cIt\u2019s a common mistake.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d sleep if I could, but even if I try I won\u2019t be able to,\u201d Peter tells her. He takes her cup of hot chocolate, then heads over to the drawer to get her a refill. \u201cI might as well do something useful.\u201d\n\u201cWhen is the last time you slept?\u201d Natasha asks, genuinely curious.\n\u201cEnglish class, last Thursday,\u201d Peter says, shrugging. \u201cI probably should\u2019ve gotten detention for it, but I think Mr. Harris felt bad. Ned took notes for me, so it was fine in the end.\u201d\n\u201cPeter.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he asks, and there\u2019s an edge to his voice. \u201cWhat do you want me to say, Nat?\u201d\nHe sets down her hot chocolate in front of her extremely gently, the way he always does when he\u2019s trying hard not to break things. Natasha looks away from him. She\u2019s never been good at having conversations like this. Not unless she has a persona to hide behind, something that makes it real for the other person, but not for her. \nPeter said all those nights ago that he wanted her to be herself. She\u2019s not entirely sure who she is without a persona. Natasha likes creating personas: she feels like a chef; a sprinkle of a sense of humor, a pinch of flintiness, three cups of emotional awareness. She likes being able to control who she is, so she can control how to react.\nBecause right now, staring at the kid in front of her? She has no idea what to do.\n\u201cI want you to talk to Bruce,\u201d she says finally, and she can see the disappointment in his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t want insomnia to take over your life.\u201d\nPeter\u2019s hand curls tightly around the mug, and he looks at the ground. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t\u2014,\u201d\nHe breaks off, and his eyes drift back up to meet hers. He glances around the kitchen, from the cups of hot chocolate sitting in front of them, to his hands clenched around his mug, to the clock on the wall that reads 1:34 AM.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d says Peter finally. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to Bruce.\u201d\nNatasha blackmails Tony into tracking down Bruce the next morning. It\u2019s not even really blackmail; all she has to do is mention Peter\u2019s name and Tony is nodding in agreement. \n\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about calling Bruce to take a look at him for a while now,\u201d Tony admits. \u201cI\u2019ve done what I can for him; I\u2019ve charted his DNA and done the best I can to figure out what\u2019s changed inside of him, but biology isn\u2019t really my area of expertise.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you know how to contact Bruce?\u201d Natasha says, making an effort to keep her voice level.\n\u201cNot really, no,\u201d says Tony. \u201cJust give me a couple of days.\u201d\n\u00a0\n___\n\u00a0\nBy the time anything happens, it\u2019s been almost two weeks. It\u2019s Peter\u2019s spring break, and he\u2019s spending five days at the tower while his aunt attends a conference in DC.\nIt\u2019s nice, having him in the tower. Without him, it\u2019s tense and awkward. Steve and Tony avoid each other like the plague\u2014idiots, Natasha thinks, but she isn\u2019t ready to play referee. It\u2019s a cesspool of unresolved feelings and avoided eye contact. It makes Natasha want to test out her new Bites on them until they stop acting like stubborn children.\nWhen Peter\u2019s in the tower, the atmosphere changes somewhat. He was never really a part of the political rift between them all, so he acts as a sort of buffer. It\u2019s not that he\u2019s neutral; if it ever came down to it, everyone knows whose side he\u2019s on. But even Team Cap is ridiculously fond of him.\nIt\u2019s because he\u2019s so nice, Natasha thinks. He goes out of his way to do things for people. He brings Wanda little trinkets he made in shop class. He gives Steve a stuffed pit bull that has a giant red, white, and blue hat (Tony can\u2019t stop laughing, but Steve puts it on top of his dresser anyway). \nAnd with those wide brown eyes and that slack-jawed wonder? He makes them all feel like heroes. And that\u2019s a feeling most of them haven\u2019t had in a really long time.\nThey\u2019re all in the kitchen watching Vision make spaghetti when the elevator doors ding. It\u2019s funny, how the room instantly changes. Tony\u2019s suit is on in half a second, Clint\u2019s bow is in his fist, and everyone is on high alert.\n\u201cWhere did those come from?\u201d Sam whispers, looking at her two pistols with wide eyes. Natasha glances down at her tank top and yoga pants and shrugs.\n\u201cStay here,\u201d Tony hisses to Peter as the group begins to creep for the door.\nPeter\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cOh you have got to be joking.\u201d\n\u201cEveryone should stay here,\u201d Natasha says through gritted teeth. \u201cI can go and see\u2014,\u201d\n\u201cHey guys,\u201d says Bruce sheepishly from the doorway. \u201cWe would\u2019ve called ahead, but neither of us have a phone.\u201d\nThor waves awkwardly from beside him.\n\u201cBrucey Bear!\u201d says Tony, and suddenly everyone is rushing forward to greet the two people in the kitchen doorway. Natasha stands back, eyes narrowed, as she looks them over. They both are wearing jeans and hoodies, and Thor is clutching an umbrella but missing his hammer. They look happy enough to see everyone, but Natasha can see the fatigue in their eyes.\nPeter hangs back with her, his eyes wider than saucers. \n\u201cOh my god,\u201d he hisses to her, his entire body practically vibrating. \u201cThat\u2019s Dr. Bruce Banner and the god of thunder. Am I dead? I\u2019m in heaven, aren\u2019t I?\u201d\n\u201cRelax,\u201d says Natasha, her lips twitching in spite of herself.\n\u201cOh, sorry Peter,\u201d says Tony, glancing back at them. \u201cBrucey, Point Break, this is Peter.\u201d\nPeter stumbles forward, throwing his hand out. \u201cOh my god, it\u2019s so cool to meet you guys. I\u2019m, like, a huge fan. Of both of you.\u201d\nThor clasps both of his hands around Peter\u2019s. \u201cThe honor is mine.\u201d\nBanner hesitantly shakes his hand next, glancing at Tony questioningly. \u201cAre you the newest member of the Avengers?\u201d\nPeter turns slightly red.\n\u201cHe\u2019s Tony\u2019s kid,\u201d Clint says, his voice unrealistically casual.\nThe noise in the room quiets at once. Peter and Tony both freeze, but neither of them say anything to protest the claim. Natasha realizes suddenly it\u2019s the first time the matter has ever been addressed by the general public.\nThor breaks the silence first, clasping Peter\u2019s hand in his own for the second time. \u201cIt is an honor to meet you, Son of Tony. I am your Uncle Thor. Your father is a dear friend of mine.\u201d\nPeter makes an odd squeak in the back of his throat, his eyes widening dramatically. Natasha turns away to cough into her hand.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d says Bruce, closing his eyes and holding up a hand. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long story,\u201d says Tony quickly, his smile wide but is teeth clenched. \u201cI\u2019ll fill you in later.\u201d\n\u201cYou know,\u201d says Steve. \u201cI\u2019ve never actually heard this story myself.\u201d\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d Peter whispers, looking like he hopes the floor will open up and swallow him. \u201cCan we not?\u201d\nNatasha decides to take pity on him. \u201cHey Vision, is the pasta supposed to be boiling over like that?\u201d\nThe kitchen once again erupts into pandemonium.\n\u00a0\n___\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo, you don\u2019t really have a kid,\u201d Bruce clarifies.\nNatasha glances around the lab, from Peter, who\u2019s eating a bowl of Vision\u2019s spaghetti, to Tony, who\u2019s attempting to unscrew part of the iron man helmet with a pair of scissors.\n\u201cAfraid not,\u201d says Tony mildly. \u201cSorry to disappoint you.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re an enhanced individual,\u201d Bruce says, pointing at Peter. \u201cBut no one\u2019s run any tests on you to figure out exactly what happened to give you your powers, or to make sure you\u2019re not a danger to yourself and others.\u201d\n\u201cI got bitten by a spider,\u201d says Peter helpfully, sprinkling gummy bears into his pasta. \u201cThat\u2019s how I got my powers.\u201d\n\u201cBut no one is exactly sure what you can do?\u201d\n\u201cI heal fast,\u201d Peter tells him. \u201cLike, really fast. If I get stabbed, it\u2019s a cut by the next morning. And I can lift really heavy things, things I couldn\u2019t lift before. And I have a spidey-sense that tells me when I\u2019m in danger.\u201d\nBruce scribbles frantically down on the notepad in front of him. \u201cDo you know how that works, exactly?\u201d\n\u201cNo idea,\u201d says Peter. \u201cAlso, I can jump really high. And climb on walls. And the ceiling.\u201d\nBruce looks completely thrown. \u201cWalls and the ceiling. Huh.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d says Peter. \u201cI looked at my fingers under a microscope, and there are these little hairs that I think help me grip.\u201d\n\u201cSo why aren\u2019t you constantly getting stuck to things that you touch?\u201d\nPeter looks confused. \u201cBecause that would be inconvenient.\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d Bruce says, intrigued. \u201cInconvenient.\u201d\n\u201cHe also doesn\u2019t sleep anymore,\u201d Natasha says pointedly. \n\u201cAnd he\u2019s completely self-sacrificial,\u201d Tony says. \u201cDo you think you can give him survival instincts, or something?\u201d\n\u201cOkay, both of you, out,\u201d says Bruce crossly. \u201cI can\u2019t run tests if you two are in here breathing down my neck.\u201d\n\u201cUm, no,\u201d says Tony. \u201cWe\u2019re not leaving.\u201d\nNatasha nods in agreement, eyes flashing. Bruce has the decency to look ashamed.\n\u201cGuys, I came here from space to consult for you,\u201d he says. \u201cGo for a run. Build something cool. But let me do my job, okay?\u201d\nNatasha looks at Peter, who quickly swallows a mouthful of spaghetti to smile at her.\n\u201cYou guys can go,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\u00a0\n___\n\u00a0\nWhile they wait, Thor attempts to teach them all some sort of Asguardian game with dice and a strange set of cards. He\u2019s extremely vague about the rules, and Natasha isn\u2019t entirely sure what the goal of the game is. Or who\u2019s winning. She\u2019s not even one hundred percent sure who\u2019s playing. \nAt one point, Thor waves his umbrella around and it changes into his hammer. He holds it lovingly for a few minutes, and then sets it down carefully on a book on the coffee table.\nHe gives them a vague outline of what he and Bruce have been doing up in space. From what Natasha can understand, they met on a planet and fought in a gladiator show off, which Thor won by a very large margin.\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound right,\u201d Tony says, glancing towards the staircase that led down to the labs.\n\u201cIt\u2019s what happened,\u201d Thor tells him firmly.\nThor tries to press them all for details about what\u2019s been happening on Earth, but no one seems to want to talk about the civil war. Steve eventually tells him the bare minimum about the Accords, but no one says anything about the feud.\nNatasha suspects that Thor guesses some of what went down, but if so he\u2019s too polite to say anything.\n\u201cSo,\u201d says Sam finally. \u201cWhat exactly are Bruce and the kid up to?\u201d\n\u201cBonding,\u201d Tony and Natasha say at the same time.\nThey don\u2019t come up to the labs for an hour and a half. By the time they finally appear, Natasha actually understands about five percent of Thor\u2019s game.\n\u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d asks Tony.\n\u201cI\u2019ll fill you guys in later,\u201d says Bruce, settling down next to Natasha.\n\u201cHiding something?\u201d asks Clint casually.\n\u201cNo, just tired of science,\u201d says Bruce. His tone is casual, but he\u2019s staring determinedly at the unique cards on the table. \u201cOh, you guys are playing Brauflutning.\u201d\n\"I assume you will play, Dr. Banner,\u201d says Thor, looking delighted. \u201cAnd you as well, Son of Tony.\u201d\nPeter freezes like a deer in headlights.\n\u201cUm,\u201d he says.\n\u201cNo, I think I\u2019ve defiantly had enough,\u201d Sam says, getting up and stretching. \u201cWe\u2019ve literally been playing for hours, and I still have no idea what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m out, too,\u201d says Steve firmly. \u201cThanks for teaching us, though.\u201d\n\u201cOh, come on,\u201d says Tony. \u201cI was just about to figure it out.\u201d\nThor stands too. \u201cIn that case, I will retire for the night as well.\u201d\n\u201cWait,\u201d says Peter. \u201cMr. Thor, your hammer is on my chem textbook.\u201d\nNatasha knows what is going to happen a second before it does. Peter reaches out over the coffee table and picks up the hammer like its weightless, holding it out to Thor with his genuine smile and wide eyes.\nThe room goes completely still.\n\u201cHoly shit,\u201d says Sam softly. \nNatasha shivers slightly, unable to tear her eyes away. \nThor reaches out to and takes his hammer, looking like he expects Peter to grow fangs and attack him. Peter takes a step back and nervously glances around the room.\n\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d he asks Tony. Tony doesn\u2019t respond, his eyes fixed firmly on the hammer.\nPeter\u2019s eyes swing over to Natasha. \u201cNat?\u201d he asks uncertainly.\n\u201cJesus fucking Christ,\u201d says Steve, determinedly not looking at Peter.\n\u201cLanguage,\u201d says Tony, and the spell is broken. Wanda lapses into hysterical giggles, and Natasha glances over at Bruce, who looks just as astounded as she feels.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, kid,\u201d Natasha tells Peter, moving forward so she can put an arm around his shoulders. He looks up at her, relief in his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s just been a really long day for all of us.\u201d\n\u201cNo kidding,\u201d mutters Sam. \u201cJust when I think I\u2019ve got that kid all figured out. Jesus.\u201d\n___\nLater, Natasha brings a cup of coffee to Bruce\u2019s lab.\nIt\u2019s late, but he\u2019s still up, going over data that looks suspiciously like Peter\u2019s DNA. He gives her a small smile and she sits with him, looking at the screens in front of him and pretends she understands what they\u2019re saying.\n\u201cSome kid, huh?\u201d Bruce says.\nNatasha\u2019s throat feels oddly tight. \u201cSome kid,\u201d she agrees.\n\u201cYou know, when I got Tony\u2019s distress signal, this wasn\u2019t exactly what I expected,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd that thing with Thor\u2019s hammer? Jesus. I\u2019ve never seen Thor look so put out.\u201d\n\u201cSeeing Peter lift it was definitely unexpected.\u201d\n\u201cNothing could\u2019ve prepared me,\u201d Bruce says. He gestures towards the screen. \u201cTasha, this kid isn\u2019t even human.\u201d\n\u201cOf course he is,\u201d Natasha says firmly. \n\u201cAn insane amount of his DNA has been altered,\u201d Bruce says, his eyes lighting up the way they always do when he talks about science. \u201cIf he\u2019d been bitten earlier, I can\u2019t even guess how he would\u2019ve developed. Hell, if he\u2019d somehow been infected in utero, he might have eight legs. There\u2019s just no way of knowing.\u201d\nNatasha nods.\n\u201cTasha,\u201d Bruce says deliberately. \u201cThe amount of power this kid has . . .\u201d\nNatasha waves the information away without processing it. \u201cHe can handle it,\u201d she says firmly.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good person?\u201d Bruce says anxiously.\n\u201cThe best.\u201d\n\u201cJesus,\u201d Bruce says, leaning back in his chair and rubbing his eyes.\nNatasha hesitates, unsure how to broach the subject she came down to discuss.\n\u201cWhat about his insomnia?\u201d she asks. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t sleep for days at a time, Bruce, and he functions normally.\u201d\n\u201cI talked to him about it a little,\u201d Bruce says. \u201cAs far as I can figure, the problems started before the bite. And you can\u2019t really talk, Nat, you don\u2019t sleep at all either.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s different.\u201d\n\u201cIs it?\u201d\nNatasha frowns at him. \u201cSo you\u2019re saying you can\u2019t help him.\u201d\nBruce sighs. \u201cI\u2019m saying that whatever problems he has with sleep are psychosomatic.\u201d\nNatasha\u2019s voice is tight. \u201cWhat does that mean, exactly?\u201d\nBruce hesitates. \u201cIt means he\u2019d probably be this way even if he hadn\u2019t been bitten by some radioactive spider.\u201d\n\u201cMay and Mr. Stark want to put me in therapy,\u201d Peter tells her shyly a few weeks after his diagnosis. \nThey\u2019re sitting at the kitchen table drinking their hot chocolate. Peter made the drinks, and he never heats up the water enough; he also screwed up the proportions so hers mostly tastes like water.\nNatasha doesn\u2019t care. She talked him out of adding miscellaneous types of candy, so she\u2019s counting it as a win.\n\u201cOh?\u201d Natasha says. Her eyes find the clock on the stove. 4:14 AM.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter says. He bites his lower lip and stirs his hot chocolate slowly with a spoon. \u201cIt\u2019s stupid.\u201d\nNatasha raises an eyebrow. \u201cWhy do you think so?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Peter says, and there\u2019s a hint of indignation in his voice. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with me, alright?\u201d\n\u201cI never said there was,\u201d Natasha says, but her eyes flick back to the clock.\nPeter\u2019s hands clench around his hot chocolate. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re up, too. When you don't sleep for days everyone thinks it's badass, but when I do it it's this huge problem.\u201d\nNatasha tilts her head to one side. Her eyes drift down to meet his, and she frowns slightly.\n\u201cPeter, none of us want you to turn out like us,\u201d Natasha says finally. \u201cPlease. Don\u2019t try to turn me into a role model.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s bullsh\u2014,\u201d Peter breaks off, catching sight of her raised eyebrows. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous, Nat. You\u2019re . . . you\u2019re incredible.\u201d\nHis eyes are so wide. Natasha realizes with a pang that she\u2019ll do whatever it takes to make sure they stay that way.\n\u201cYou should go to therapy, Peter,\u201d Natasha says. \u201cYou can\u2019t exactly be prescribed melatonin; you\u2019d metabolize it before it even started to kick in. And you can\u2019t go through your life sleeping ten hours a week.\u201d\n\u201cWhose side are you on?\u201d Peter demands. \nNatasha gives him a dry smile.\n\u201cTherapy won\u2019t help,\u201d he says sullenly.\n\u201cMaybe. But it might.\u201d\n\u201cNo, it won\u2019t,\u201d Peter insists. He looks at her, his eyes narrowing. \u201cBen and May tried to make me talk to a few cheap counselors after . . . when I was nine. It was a waste of time and money. I don\u2019t want to do that again.\u201d\nNatasha takes a sip of hot chocolate and thinks for a minute. She knows that, of course; it\u2019s all in his medical file. It wasn\u2019t easy to get her hands on; it required a great deal of hacking and a few favors from an old friend at Kaiser. \nGetting it was part of the same routine background check. It\u2019s nothing personal. She knows too much about everyone.\n\u201cYou\u2019re older now,\u201d Natasha says, wrapping her hands around her mug. \u201cYou never know, Peter.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll make you a deal,\u201d Peter replies. \u201cI\u2019ll go to therapy if you do.\u201d\nHe smiles at her, triumphant. He\u2019s sure he\u2019s backed her into a corner now, sure he\u2019s got her on his side. Because she\u2019s the Black fucking Widow, and there\u2019s no way in hell she\u2019d ever go to therapy.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Natasha says, and the look on his face makes everything worth it. \u201cDeal.\u201d\n\u00a0\n___\n\u00a0\nNatasha goes to therapy once, doesn\u2019t say a single word, and leaves after fifteen minutes. But that\u2019s okay, because she technically kept her promise to Peter and he has no way of finding out.\nShe picks him up from school every other Tuesday and drives him to the private office in Manhattan. She knows that there\u2019s no shortage of adults who\u2019d be willing to take him, but it\u2019s her way of making sure that he goes every time. After he finishes, she takes him back up to the compound to work in the labs with Tony.\n\u201cHow was it?\u201d Natasha asks him after every session. He always tries to give her a dirty look, but he\u2019s crap at being intimidating.\n\u00a0\n___\n\u00a0\nThe change doesn\u2019t happen all at once.\nIt starts small. Natasha starts being the first one in the kitchen, with Peter not making an appearance until three or four. He still comes, every night, but he\u2019s rubbing the sleep out of his eyes instead of stumbling around in a sleep-deprived fever.\nThen, after a few months, there\u2019s a night when she doesn\u2019t see him at all. She waits up until five-thirty before she crawls into bed and goes back to sleep. When she wakes up, someone\u2019s left waffles with gummy bears and m&amp;ms on her bedside table.\n\u00a0\n___\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be completely better,\u201d Peter tells her quietly.\nIt\u2019s 3:38 AM. She wasn\u2019t expecting to see him when she went for her late night cup of hot chocolate, but he was there, chemistry textbook out in front of him, waiting for her to show up.\nNatasha makes them both hot chocolate and sits down across from him. His eyes are fixed firmly on the textbook in front of him, and he won\u2019t look at her. \n\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d Natasha tells him.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d Peter says, and his voice is tight. \u201cNat, I\u2019ve been seeing a goddamn therapist two times a month for three months. This isn\u2019t supposed to still be happening. There are still nights when . . .\u201d\nNatasha waits for him to finish his sentence, but he never does. He looks up at her with his huge brown eyes, full of desperation and fear. \n\u201cI\u2019m still so tired,\u201d he says dully. \u201cLike, all the time. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s ever going to go away.\u201d\nNatasha has no idea what to tell him. Her throat feels tight too, and for the first time she\u2019s the one who can\u2019t look at him.\n\u00a0\n___\n\u00a0\nShe doesn\u2019t see him often at night anymore. He\u2019s gotten better at sleeping. There are still nights when she finds him slumped over the kitchen table in the early morning, but for the most part he stays in bed, even when he can\u2019t sleep. That\u2019s what he tells her, anyway.\nBut she still sees him. She picks him up from school sometimes, even though he\u2019s stopped going to therapy. Natasha knows Tony and May are disappointed; they wanted him to keep going. \nThere\u2019s a lot of things that they still have to deal with. Even when he gets to sleep, he still has nightmares. She knows because Tony gave her access to his vitals, monitored by the Starkwatch on his left wrist. He still hasn\u2019t told the team that he\u2019s Spiderman, but that\u2019s okay. Natasha\u2019s pretty sure the they know, even if they haven\u2019t outright admitted it.\n\u201cHey,\u201d says Clint one night, his tone extremely casual. \u201cPete, one of my friends has a fantastic recipe for cookies that seems exactly like something you\u2019d make. They\u2019ve got gummy bears and skittles and six cups of sugar. He even has a Youtube channel where he shows you how to bake them.\u201d\nPeter doesn\u2019t stop coughing for three minutes. His face is exactly the same shade of red as the Netfix logo on his tee-shirt.\n(The video disappears from Spiderman\u2019s Youtube channel the next day. It doesn\u2019t matter, bootlegged copies are just one Google search away. After all, once something gets put on the internet, it never comes down.)\n\u00a0\n___\n\u00a0\nSam says he was completely joking when he suggested a \u201cfamily movie night\u201d but somehow they all end up watching Star Wars in the compound\u2019s home theater anyway.\nNatasha looks around the room. Wanda and Vision are determinedly six feet apart on the couch; their on-again off-again relationship is currently on hiatus. Sam is pointing out all the errors in the film to a perplexed Steve. Thor and Bruce are gone again, but they promised to swing by for a visit in a few weeks. Clint is visiting his family, but he\u2019s bringing his kids by soon to meet everyone.\nPeter is slumped against Tony\u2019s shoulder, fast asleep and silhouetted by the light of the screen. The room is too dark for anyone to see Natasha\u2019s smirk.\n\u00a0\n___\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou never took the A-team challenge,\u201d Peter pouts the next morning.\nHe\u2019s making his signature waffles, and the kitchen reeks of burned Skittles. Everyone else has hastily made their way into the living room, but Natasha stays with him, watching carefully to make sure he doesn\u2019t set anything on fire.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the\u2014,\u201d Natasha breaks off. \u201cOh. Sorry.\u201d\n\u201cIf you actually managed your own Instagram, you\u2019d know that people are still begging you to take it,\u201d Peter tells her.\n\u201cNot really my thing,\u201d Natasha tells him apologetically, her hand snaking out to steal some skittles from the bag. Peter swats her hand away.\n\u201cYou know, if you want good PR, you have to humanize yourself to the general public,\u201d he tells her reproachfully. \u201cEveryone who knows you loves you, but everyone who doesn\u2019t is just terrified of you.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d Peter tells her. \u201cNot good!\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d Natasha says, pulling out her phone. \u201cPut on the mask.\u201d\nPeter\u2019s face lights up. \u201cYou\u2019re doing the challenge?\u201d \n\u201cNo,\u201d says Natasha. \u201cBut I\u2019ll take a picture with you. Final offer.\u201d\n\u00a0\n___\n\u00a0\nThe picture is posted on her Instagram account twenty minutes later. It\u2019s a selfie, with Natasha smiling dangerously at the camera. Peter stands behind her, his arms wrapped around her and his cheek pressed into hers.\nPeter insists she caption it Spiderfam.\n\u201cIt\u2019s catchy,\u201d he tells her.\n\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d she responds.\nIt also gets more likes than any other photo she\u2019s ever posted. \nThis fucking kid."
