    "text": "University of Michigan was happy to receive Katsuki Yuuri back for a masters in education. The rink in Detroit that had been the happy hell of Yuuri\u2019s college years was on its knees in slobbering delight to have Victor Nikiforov play a relaxed coach, teaching low level courses for the community on the weekends while the weekday saw Yuri Plisetsky cutting the ice to shreds.\n\nYuri refused to waste his time on college. At eighteen, he saw himself with minimum ten years of competition left in his body. If Victor had been almost thirty when he\u2019d really truly, no more take-backs, retired, then he\u2019ll be double-damned if he stops before Victor.\n\nThey do not live in Detroit. Victor rejects the city as a homestead. The first time he encounters the back parking lot of Meijer co-opted into \u201ctrunk or treat\u201d he thinks he\u2019s going to get murdered. His bone-crushing hand hold on Yuuri had only just been on this side of endearing. He's sporting\u00a0an irrational fear stoked by news stories and he'll\u00a0just have to learn to relax. Although honestly, Victor's wary of America as a whole. Yuuri soothes him with a recollection of going to a trunk or treat on halloween with Phichit dressed as cowboys, the most American thing they could think of at the time. \u201cIt might have been this same Meijer\u2026\u201c\n\nVictor and Yuri like the cider mills Yuuri takes them to a lot more. Between that and the leaves changing colors, both Russians relax. The doctor\u2019s out on whether or not they like hot dogs.\n\nYuuri, Victor, and Yuri live in Ferndale, the gayest place in Michigan. They\u2019re in a nice condo, unable to settle on buying a house. Yuuri\u2019s education will keep him in America and the rink is rather tempting to stay permanently, but it\u2019s still a little up in the air. It\u2019s not like they need to rush.\n\nSo that\u2019s the happy situation. Yuuri\u2019s in school, desiring a career as a k-12 guidance counselor. Victor\u2019s coaching Yuri full time, Yakov finally retiring. He calls Victor every week, but only once; he refuses to talk to Victor more than once a week. Bad for his health, he says. Victor wants to take on more skaters but he doesn\u2019t want to overload either of their lives; he likes having lazy weekends, and Yuuri likes coming home to him. Yuuri loaded all of his classes on a Tuesday/Thursday schedule because the hour long commute from Ferndale to Ann Arbor kills him. He listens to a lot of Audiobooks and starts an affair with Biggby.\n\nIt was a big jump, after Yuuri retired finally at 27, but they were never a couple who took the time to wet their toes.\n\n\u201cKatsooki? Uh, Niki--\u201d\n\n\u201cYou may call me simply Yuuri,\u201d is the soft, strangely formal introduction from the Asian dude sitting near the exit. \u201cPlease.\u201d\n\n\u201cYuri,\u201d the woman next to him says, losing all the lilt over the vowel. Asian dude, Yuuri, nods with an amused smile.\n\n\u201cGay,\u201d Mark whispers, leaning over and across Ky to check Yuuri out. \u201cAnd beautiful.\u201d\n\nAnd yeah, gay is rolling off the man. He\u2019s in a boxy thick knit sweater but his pants are screaming tight and, Jesus, Yuuri crosses his legs and his thighs are obscene. Mark whimpers. Yuuri\u2019s texting on a cell phone that has no less than seven key charms clinking together like wind chimes.\n\nYuuri it seems is only around campus on Tuesday and Thursdays. He has a GSA course Thursday nights. He smiles at Ky and Mark out of sheer recognition. It\u2019s Yuuri, them, Darla and Nadine. Nadine has two kids and aside from passing mirages in the library, is never to be seen outside of class. She vampires on and off campus, Mark swears. Ky doesn\u2019t like Darla, but Darla likes to sit next to Yuuri in Childhood Development, so it takes a solid week of passing smiles until Ky can invite Yuuri to join her and Mark for coffee.\n\n\u201cI live in Ferndale,\u201d Yuuri says. \u201cI moved here recently. I went to UMich for undergrad years ago.\u201d\n\nMark\u2019s crushes Ky\u2019s knee at the mention of Ferndale. \u201cSame,\u201d she manages to say without a wince.\n\u201cI went to Ohio state,\u201d Mark volunteers. \u201cGo Buckeyes!\u201d\n\nYuuri blinks, confusion magnified behind stylish glasses.\n\n\u201cFootball?\u201d Mark clarifies, disbelieving. \u00a0\u201cBig rival? Kind of impossible to ignore?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d Yuuri blushes and looks down into his coffee, twiddling his fingers back and forth over the other where they curl around his cup. He bites his lip, chewing a reprimand there. \u201cRight! Sorry. I never paid attention when I was undergrad, I didn't spend much time around campus. I don't now either. Sorry. I\u2019ve been far removed from uh, America culture? For years. I'm still getting back into the swing of...football. But now that you say it,\u201d he squints suspiciously, hopeless and adorable, and says in a grave tone, \"we should not like Buckeyes.\"\n\nHis accent speaks for itself. It\u2019s cobbled, the round Japanese pronunciation peaked at the vowels with something else Ky can\u2019t place. They don\u2019t learn a whole lot about Yuuri at that coffee hangout. He\u2019s an attentive listener and even better at keeping the conversation away from him. Mark and Ky, who met a few times over the years at conferences leading up to their Masters program, fall into a rhythm of friendship. But Yuuri never once looks lonely or longing.\n\n\nIt\u2019s just outside of the classroom that Mark spies Yuuri in a theatrical phone conversation. He has one hand pressed to his cheeks, eyes drifted towards the ceiling in seeming annoyance but they rove, like they\u2019re searching for an answer, seeking to remember; then Yuuri\u2019s face splits into an over-acted smile and a teasing drum roll of language leaves his lips: \u201cKotyonok! Ne kipyatis!\u201d He titters with laughter, has to hold the phone away from his ear when a screeching resounds in response.\n\nHe sees Mark and waves, resuming his conversation in quieter English. Mark waves back a minute after Yuuri\u2019s already turned his gaze away.\n\n\u201cHe speaks Russian. I think he\u2019s a spy,\u201d Mark concludes. \u201cJapanese, Russian? Mafia. He\u2019s totally in the mafia.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe classic Mafia-spy gets his masters in Education so he can counsel America\u2019s youth to a life of crime. I should have seen such an obvious trap.\u201d Ky smashes a fist into her open palm, looking deceived and aghast. When Yuuri joins them, slinging his messenger bag off his shoulder, tucking his monstrosity of a phone into a front pocket, Ky springs the new information on him.\n\n\u201cAre you Russian?\u201d\n\n\u201cEh?\u201d Yuuri squints, taking his glasses off to rub them on the corner of his shirt. He has a cat-eared beanie on. Mafia. Jesus. \u201cNot technically,\u201d this makes him smile. \u201cI lived there for a few years. St. Petersburg.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? That\u2019s so cool.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d Mark asks stiffly. \u201cRussia? Like. Russia?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d Yuuri looks more and more confused, withdrawing from them slightly. \u201cIt\u2019s very lovely.\u201d\n\nKy elbows Mark and Mark backs off.\n\n\nYuuri sets office hours on Tuesday to go along with his Thursday ones because students love him. They probably love him in a creepy way on top of the pure love he infects everyone with. A \"I want to be locked in a room with him\" way compared to the usually \"god I hope he gets lots of sleep and is always warm and fed\" way.\u00a0\n\nYuuri mentions this at lunch. He always packs homemade meals and always shares a bite with Ky and Mark. Today it\u2019s some weird salmon pastry thing. Yuuri hadn\u2019t bothered to microwave it, and it\u2019s a little doughy now with cold oil. Tastes okay though.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t need help with school.\u00a0 They just want to cry in the library.\u201d He looks so worried.\n\n\u201cYou know what you should do?\u201d Mark volunteers, chin in hand and batting his eyes. Yuuri had said quite early on that Mark had nice eyes, that he reminded Yuuri of his friend Chris in many ways. Mark had taken this compliment and run with it. \u201cGo out with us this weekend! You never hang out off campus.\u201d\n\nThey had years ahead in this program. Forging strong bonds would ensure they survive.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Yuuri apologies. \u201cI\u2019m going to the exhibition skate at Detroit University. You two should go. Yuri Plisetsky is a gold medalist skater, it\u2019s a very cheap way to see him.\u201d\n\nMen\u2019s ice skating is about the gayest thing either of them have ever heard.\n\n\u201cI have a standing date with that technician I met on HER,\u201d Ky says, \u201cat the club we\u2019re going to. But that sounds fun!\u201d Actually it doesn\u2019t. Outside of the winter Olympics, ice skating occupies zero of her thoughts, and even then she only watches the women's skate.\n\n\u201cOoh, I would,\u201d Mark pouts, sitting back in his chair. He jerks a thumb at Ky. \u201cBut I don\u2019t let her meet strangers alone.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s understandable.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nThey\u2019re really kind of dumb. Like. Really. Because they had assumed erroneously that Yuuri was Japanese-Russian. That Katsuki-Nikiforov was his parents\u2019 last names and that they were divorced. Yuuri has a gold ring on his right hand but he also has cat earrings and he wears cute hair clips, so the jewelry all merges into one innocuous blur.\u00a0\n\nThe jig ends in Dovetail.\n\nThey\u2019re in Warren because Mark had been sick for most of the week, So Ky ran into Yuuri when she was going to swing over and bring him to the land of the living. Yuuri, who was planning to eat a thermos of miso soup, immediately offered his lunch, swearing by its healing properties, but had gotten roped along for the trip.\n\n\u201cTrust me, Yuuri. One look at your cute face and Mark will be good as gold!\u201d\n\nYuuri blushed all over and damn. Ky sent a frantic text to Mark:\n\u00a0\nTo: Marky Mark\nYuuri is coming! I suggest showering and putting on cologne!\n\nFrom: Marky Mark\nWHAT\nOMH\nGNMG\nNO PLEASE\n\n\nAside from a red nose and bags under his eyes, Mark looks good. Like actually put in effort, is wearing a clean shirt and everything. There\u2019s argyle, so Ky doesn\u2019t give him too much credit.\n\n\u201cThese thermoses are amazing,\u201d Yuuri explains, pouring out a steaming cup of miso into the lid. \u201cThey keep liquid hot almost all day. I hate the microwave in the department office.\u201d He wrinkles his nose judgmentally but pushes the soup Mark\u2019s way with an encouraging smile. Mark\u2019s gonna start crying real tears right there.\n\nThere\u2019s a group of teenage girls in the booth beside them. They\u2019re looking over. Like, a lot. They\u2019re looking at Yuuri and whispering, clicking away frantically on their laptops. Oh, sweet young love, Ky thinks. Yuuri\u2019s frowning, head cocked their way, clearly trying to eavesdrop, a pink radiance firmly fixed on his face. Ah, the flower is embarrassed.\u00a0 He\u2019s as sweet as a cream puff. And she really needs to lay off the weird comparisons.\n\nOne of the girls shoves the closest girl across the booth bench, towards Yuuri. \u201cAsk,\u201d they whisper-hiss.\u00a0\n\nYuuri looks young, yeah, could easily pass for his early twenties, but not for a teenager. His jaw is too strong, his body too thick. He\u2019s got a baby-face but that\u2019s a man\u2019s body and yikes @ the girls.\n\nBut a big, cheek-busting grin bounces onto Yuuri\u2019s face and he turns to them. \u201cWould you like autographs?\u201d\n\nUh huh huh what now?\n\nA muffled scream swells in one girls throat, and the other bursts out \u201cI knew it!\u201d and the other one, closest, holds up her phone, eyes big. \u201cWe thought we saw you at the exhibition the other week.\u201d\n\n\u201cKy, I think my fever\u2019s back,\u201d Mark proclaims, disoriented and groping at her shoulder. \u201cYuuri\u2019s taking selfies with teenage girls.\u201d\n\n\u201cN-no\u2026no that\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs Victor really teaching community kids classes?\u201d\n\u201cIs it bad if we go?\u201d\n\nYuuri laughs. \u201cHe is. Only on the weekends. You can check the website for hours and availability.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay. Okay. We\u2019re sorry. You\u2019re with your friends. Hi Yuuri\u2019s friends!\u201d The girls wave. Ky and Mark wave back and they\u2019re not sure why. \u201cOh my god. Okay. Tell Victor we love him and tell Yuri that he was amazing at the exhibition. Tell him he has angels in Michigan. But Victor too. Just because he\u2018s retired doesn\u2018t mean he doesn\u2018t have fans. You too. You too, Yuuri. Uh, wow. Okay.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will.\u201d Yuuri promises seriously, nodding his head and shifting back to his seat. He\u2019d maintained his cool, but his ears are scarlet, and even as he picks up his coffee cup, there\u2019s a mild tremor in his hands, a dazed look in his eyes. The girls can\u2018t seem to recover and after a second hesitation, scramble out of the coffee shop to scream in the parking lot and slam into a car.\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he mumbles bashfully.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Ky asks.\n\n\u201cWho\u2018s Victor?\u201d Mark adds. He has the back of his hand pressed to his forehead, checking himself futilely for a fever.\n\n\u201cVictor?\u201d Yuuri\u2019s face scrunches up. In what reality could they not know Victor? His Victor? The audacity! \u201cThat\u2019s my husband.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour -- your --husband?\u201d Mark gasps. His hand falls into his lap.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an interesting personal fact,\u201d Ky says stiffly, eyes wide. \u201cThat one would share over almost two months of knowing people.\u201d\n\nYuuri looks down at the ring on his finger and holds up his hand.\n\n\u201cFashion!\u201d Mark wails.\n\n\u201cMy names hyphenated. Katsuki-Nikiforov\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cDivorce!\u201d Mark defends.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not divorcing Victor?\u201d Yuuri looks frazzle, sinking into his seat and pulling his shoulders up. \u201cWe\u2019re very in love.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, husband. Husband Victor. Victor Nikiforov?\u201d Ky tries. Yuuri nods slowly. She pats Mark on the thigh. \u201cThat\u2019s lovely, Yuuri. We hope to meet him.\u201d She pinches Mark into obedience when he grunts a protest. \u201cHow about the whole uhm, autographs thing?\u201d\n\nYuuri\u2019s mouth goes round. He has no right to look surprised that they don\u2019t know. He wiggles in his seat. \u201cI\u2019m a retired competitive men\u2019s figure skater. I won several golds for Japan.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fuck, Yuuri,\u201d Ky laughs, putting her face into her hands. \u201cHow do you keep that shit on the DL?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt never seems appropriate to say?\u201d he offers, shrugging. \u201cUhm. Victor, m-my husband. He\u2019s a retired competitive skater too.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom Russia?\u201d Mark guesses glumly. Yuuri nods, smiling brightly now, fucking warmed to the core by talking of his husband. Disgusting.\n\n\u201cYes. He won the gold in the Olympics back in 2006 and 2018, just before he retired. He\u2019s uh,\u201d Yuuri catches sight of Ky and Mark\u2019s bug-eyed looks at the mention of Olympics, and he stumbles along, \u201che\u2019s uh, I guess, the most, decorated skater in men\u2019s singles\u2026like ever?\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a long silence. Mark\u2019s mumbling deliriously under his breath. Ky folds her hands in front of her, fingers laced, assuming full counselor mode with a critical eye.\n\n\u201cAnd this other Yuri? Is this the Yuri Pli-plissy-platypus-what\u2019s his name, that skater you mentioned before.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlisetsky,\u201d Yuuri corrects. \u201cYes. He\u2019s our prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Victor\u2019s coaching him. He\u2019s also a gold medalist, although he\u2019s only eighteen. We like to think of him as our son,\u201d Yuuri finishes with a beaming smile. \u201cSorry to have kept this from you, I didn\u2019t mean anything by it. It just doesn\u2019t seem fitting to drag my whole life into everyday conversation.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d Ky drawls. \u201cHey, so Yuuri, did you go to the Olympics?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh\u2026 yes. I got bronze. My friend Chris, who I said you reminded me of Mark, he got silver!\u201d Yuuri volunteers this like it matters the most in this situation.\n\n\u201cOh, naturally,\u201d Mark agrees. \u201cI remind you of your Olympian friend. Who stood next to your two-time gold medalist\u00a0Olympian husband.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, hey,\u201d Ky says, \u201cThat\u2019s cool. That was a fun thing to learn. Legally, you have to invite us over simply so we can like, ceremoniously close this story with drinks with your secret husband and secret adopted son. How about that?\u201d\n\n\u201cS-sure. Victor\u2019s wanted to meet you anyway.\u201d Yuuri sips his coffee, still looking a little off-balanced but there\u2019s a smile peaking from the corner of his lips.\nEventually that coffee shop moment had to end. Ky had to drive Yuuri back to campus because Yuuri had night class and had to go home to his secret Russian Olympic husband. But the weird awe didn\u2019t leave. The world had shifted several degrees and taken Ky and Mark for its crooked journey.\n\nMark facetimed Ky the second she\u2019d texted him that she was home.\n\n\u201cI Googled him and he\u2019s beautiful,\u201d is the first thing out of Mark\u2019s mouth. \u201cI\u2019m so shook.\u201d\n\nKy hadn\u2019t yet. She\u2019d been driving and she wanted to be home and not wearing a bra and possibly be drunk before she began this foray into Yuuri\u2019s private life. This is the closest brush with a famous person she\u2019s had since she was at a bar the day after Lady Gaga had been there.\n\n\u201cLook at him, Ky. Victor Nikioforov. What the actual fuck. I\u2019m sorry, but this is unfair. This is -- like -- I\u2019ve been watching ice skating videos for three hours straight since I got home. I still can't tell what the difference is between jumps. I\u2019m mad. I don\u2019t know how to process my feelings. I thought being gay meant I had a better grasp on my emotions but this is -- I\u2019m\u2026 I don\u2019t?? Help me. Ky, come over. I need you,\u201d Mark whines plaintively into his phone\u2019s camera.\n\nKy thumb-swipes away from Mark\u2019s pathetic, shattered expression and pulls up Google. \u2018Victor\u2019 is all she needs because he\u2019s the third option. God damnit. Just for curiosity\u2019s sake, she types in \u2018Katsuki and he\u2019s the second option! God! Damnit! They could have known this weeks ago if they had any basic internet stalking sense. But Yuuri hadn\u2019t even had a Facebook and they\u2019d given up too soon.\n\nShe\u2019ll save this for an interview question: I learned the value of going to extra mile because I didn\u2019t internet stalk my friend enough to know that he\u2019s an Olympic athlete.\n\nAnyway. Back to Victor Nikiforov.\n\nA man\u2019s never made her feel this way before.\n\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d she inhales, hand over her mouth. Mark can\u2019t see her but he starts screaming in sympathy pain. It makes Ky feel 15 and like her best friend is getting asked to prom by the star quarterback.\n\n\u201cARE YOU SEEING THIS WILD SHIT? THEY KISSED ON INTERNATIONAL TELEVISION! I ACTUALLY REMEMBER HEARING ABOUT THAT. I REMEMBER SEEING IT I JUST NEVER REMEBERED THE NAMES. THIS IS -- IM DYING.\u201d\nMark goes quiet when he hears the sultry, up-beat music of Yuuri's 2016 short program.\n\"That's Yuuri? Our Yuuri?\" Ky's grinning at the dark figure gliding across the ice, feet a fanciful blur and hips doing all sorts of naughty beckoning to the crowd.\n\"Is that the Cup of China video?\" Mark asks excitedly. Ky checks the tags and grunts an affirmative. \"No no no go to his free skate!\"\n\"His what?\"\n\"It should be the next video down. God, watch it. Oh my god, they kiss. Watch it.\"\nOh. So that's Victor Nikiforov, smooching Yuuri on the ice. How had they missed this?\n\n\nThat same night, Yuuri texts them inviting them over Friday night for dinner at his home.\n\n\nFrom: Yuuri\nVictor really wants to meet you two! He\u2019s mad I kept him a secret. (\u00ac_\u00ac)\n\nFrom: Yuuri\nAlso please don\u2019t tell everyone about me and Victor.\n\nFrom: Yuuri\nNot that I\u2019m married to a man ! ! !\n\nFrom: Yuuri\nBut the athlete business. It\u2019s too much attention. (\u2267o\u2266)\n\n\nThey play it cool.\n\n\n\nKy finds Yuuri on Instagram but doesn\u2019t tell Mark. She doesn\u2019t follow Yuuri either. His profile is public and he has several thousand followers. Victor features heavily in the photos; when she goes to his page, his follower count is in the millions. There more than three pictures of him with Karl Lagerfeld, probably wearing something designer. It\u2019s too famous. Ky goes back to Yuuri\u2019s page, homier and less daunting. They have an old, gray-faced dog. There are beautiful wedding photos: purple and pink suits. Unbelievable. How iconic. Ky knows from her recent Google searches that the colors coordinate to the costumes they\u2019d worn for their dramatic exhibition pair skate. She\u2019s friends with a gay icon and didn\u2019t even know it. Someone come get her.\n\n\nEven with this link to Yuuri\u2019s social media, and the obsessive amount of creeping Mark\u2019s done in about 30 hours, they aren\u2019t prepared for Victor Nikiforov. If they were more acquainted with the skating world, they would know that one cannot prepare for Victor Nikiforov. In fact, preparation and Victor Nikiforov are antithetical concepts.\n\nMark steps out of his car wearing a suit. His beard is fluffed and combed, his hair braided. He\u2019s got his best attempts at dapper going on.\n\n\u201cMark,\u201d Ky sighs, slapping at the itch she can't extinguish under her braids. She steers him back to his car in the lot of Yuuri\u2019s complex. \u201cDitch the tie. Yuuri\u2019s gonna be in one of his uniqlo sweaters.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd his rich husband will be wearing Gucci!\u201d Mark protests, but he takes off his tie and tosses it in his passenger side chair.\n\nKy\u2019s a simple lady. She feels safe in a denim shirt and slacks. Yuuri hadn\u2019t mentioned a dress code and he rarely seemed inclined to formal wear.\u00a0 Yuuri screamed comfort. Mark had said Yuuri could be the marshmallow fluff to his hot chocolate. Ky could be the spoon, he\u2019d generously offered. Swirling them together. Like a wingman.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be weird. Don\u2019t proposition them for a threesome,\u201d Ky preps Mark at the door, dusting off his jacket. \u00a0\n\n\u201cHa Ha,\u201d he bites, pushing her away. \u201cDon\u2019t act like you don\u2019t wanna make both of them cry at your feet.\u201d\n\n\u201cNeither here nor there,\u201d she says tartly, pinching Mark\u2019s cheek. Their jabbering must have alerted the household because the door of Yuuri\u2019s apartment flies open; there\u2019s a blond teenager in a sweatshirt staring blankly at them. Mark touches the collar of his shirt, grateful that it\u2019s now unbuttoned.\n\n\u201cUh,\u201d says Mark.\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d says Ky.\n\n\u201cKatsudon!\u201d calls the teen. He knocks his hip into the door to keep it open. His Russian accent is thicker than sheep\u2018s wool: \u201cYou must be his friends. Come in. Shoes come off. Victor and Yuuri are fighting upstairs. Or fucking. Maybe both. Who knows. Want wine?\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re barely in the door before the kid\u2019s turned away, turning into the kitchen that\u2019s just off from the entryway and popping a bottle. \u201cNever mind; it\u2019s champagne. Oops.\u201d\n\nMark\u2019s instantly\u00a0pleased, eyes bright like a kid in a candy store, mouth gaping open. He kicks his shoes off and ditches his jacket, following after the kid who can only be Yuri Plisetsky. Mark\u2019s an instant fan of the unaccountable crassness. Ky creeps in more slowly, taking in the neat rack of shoes at the coat closet, the umbrellas in a stand, the small table hosting a dog leash and poop bags and a jar of bone support treats.\n\nThe condo\u2019s pretty big. Makes sense; these two probably host wild international parties. The kitchen\u2019s marble and dark wood, shiny but not too modern. Yuri\u2019s sitting on the counter drinking from a flute, with Mark on a stool at the island.\n\n\u201cSo, you must be Yuri, it\u2019s nice to meet you,\u201d Ky introduces, holding out her hand. Yuri takes it, grip firm but the shake quicker than a bat out of hell. \u201cI'm Ky. This is Mark. Yuuri\u2019s hasn\u2019t told us much about you.\u201d\n\nYuri barks out a laugh. \u201cApparently. It broke Victor\u2019s heart to find out Katsudon kept him a secret. He said it was almost as bad as people thinking he\u2019s straight.\u201d\n\nBoth of them guffaw. Ky accepts a glass of champagne gratefully but she cocks a manicured brow at Yuri. \u201cAren\u2019t you underage?\u201d\n\nHe's unimpressed and sly. \u201cLady. I am Russian. My mother, she gave me vodka from the teet. You do not need to worry a bit.\"\n\n\u201cShe might not but I certainly will,\u201d comes a stern voice. Yuri twitches as Yuuri marches into the kitchen. \u201cOne glass Yuri,\u201d he chides.\n\n\u201cComing from you,\u201d Yuri sniffs but he abandons the champagne bottle to Yuuri who puts it on the island, far away from the teenager\u2019s reach. It\u2019s only after the bottle is settled that he dares recognize his company; he bows a few times, face red.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to leave you down here. Victor and I were, uh, talking. I didn\u2019t hear the door. Yuri uh, already got you drinks. I'm gone three minutes and you're talking about his mother's vodka nipples...,\" he mumbles before picking up his voice again, \"I didn\u2019t have time to cook, so Victor is gong to run out in just a minute for Indian takeout. I hope that\u2019s okay. Our day got a little hectic--\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all good, Yuuri,\u201d Ky interrupts, laying a hand on his elbow. She can't watch that kind of nervous flagellation. Yuuri shuffles his feet, socks slippery on the floor and adjusts his glasses. He\u2019d clearly made an attempt to slick back his hair but it\u2019s been rumpled, maybe over-styled or\u2026grabbed by eager hands for a pre-dinner party quickie. As expected, Yuuri\u2019s in a lightweight cream turtleneck and nice dark wash jeans.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just happy to get to know you better,\u201d Mark tacks on, turning on the charm with a reassuring smile. \u201cWe\u2019re really excited. You don\u2019t have to do much to keep us happy.\u201d\n\nSo his crush will never amount to anything, he\u2018ll get over it. Yuuri\u2018s a catch, more than that, really. An educated queer man, breathtaking to look at, in the same field as Mark? The shit dreams are made of, but that\u2018s just it: dreams. It\u2019ll be an awful crush to get over and he can feel himself starting to pine as the seconds tick by.\n\nYuuri returns his smile but he\u2019s still fidgeting. Yuri kicks him in the ass with the toe of his foot, just able to reach, and the contact makes Yuuri relax and take a deep breath, like he\u2019s centering himself. He closes his eyes and when they open, he looks on his game, like when he\u2019s tearing apart an argument in class.\n\n\u201cThank you both for coming. I\u2019m still sorry my life took you two by shock.\u201c\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say,\u201c Mark mutters into his flute of champagne. Ky sips hers delicately. Dry and bubbly. Nice.\n\nYuuri winces. \u201cI have some cucumber water prepared\u2026and board games! My friend Phichit likes to play Settles of Catan, if you like that? I haven\u2019t ever had to entertain friends before that don\u2019t know me well. You\u2019re some of our first guests in this apartment.\u201d\n\nThey start to talk, the whole awkward first few minutes in a new friend\u2019s private space kind of talk. Yuri\u2019s a great ice breaker, brash and mouthy like a kid should be, and even though what he says is outlandish, it makes Yuuri relax by degrees.\n\nThen there\u2019s a flight of feet down the stairs and a bright voice singing out: \u201cYuuri!\u201d\n\nVictor Nikiforov dashes into the kitchen, sliding up behind Yuuri and embracing him in an embarrassing and affectionate hug. \u201cSorry, sorry. You know I\u2019m late to everything! Even my own party!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a party for you, dumbass,\u201d Yuri gripes.\n\nYuuri\u2019s stock-still and blushing to the root of his hair while Victor nuzzles his cheek. \u201cV-victor. You said you\u2019d behave,\u201d he whispers, reaching around and pinching Victor\u2019s side. Victor squeaks and detangles himself with a pout, but he\u2019s nothing but a calculated level of radiance, silver hair sparkling and teeth even sparklier, his blue eyes set off by a dark turtleneck.\n\nKy and Mark are on the edge of their seats, metaphorically speaking. Well, Mark is, but Ky\u2019s standing and her knees have locked up, her heart beating faster. Mark\u2019s clutching his chest, bowed slightly in premature death.\n\n\u201cHello! It\u2019s nice to meet you. You must be Mark,\u201d Victor points to each of them respectively before enthusiastically shaking their hands, \u201cand you must be Ky! Yuuri has actually told me about you both even if he is a terrible husband and kept me a secret like he\u2019s embarrassed or something heartbreaking like that,\u201d Victor goes on, flippant and dramatic. He puts a hand to his cheeks. Mark recognizes the gesture from the one Yuuri sometimes did when it sounded like he was putting on a character \u201cAnd now I have to run and grab dinner. I\u2019ll be back shortly. I\u2019m excited to get to know Yuuri\u2019s friends.\u201d\n\nHe waves at them like he\u2019s the queen riding by on a float and then whistles shrilly. It takes several minutes for the old poodle Ky had seen on Instagram to sloth its way down the steps.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re taking Makkachin?\u201d Yuuri questions, distracted and moving towards the doorway. He leans down to pet the dog in passing. The dog circles past him to sniff Ky and Mark, earn some scratchies, before ambling back to Victor.\n\n\u201cShe likes the Indian place. Beside, I\u2019ll take her for a walk before I come back in so she\u2019s done for the night,\u201d Victor explains, leashing her. Yuuri hums and the pair exchange a quick parting kiss before Victor calls out another farewell to the company. Yuuri turns back, sees everyone, and blinks like he\u2019s forgotten about them.\n\nThe moment reeked of a domesticity that Ky can barely grasp. Yuuri has this whole complex life, and yet he\u2019d walked around for two months saying nothing of it. He\u2019d been a nobody, just another graduate student, another face in the classroom. Nadine, for all her aloofness and business, made it clear she had a family, had a work history, all this stuff. But Yuuri had been able to quietly continue on another phase of his life. Ky isn\u2019t sure if she\u2019s jealous or concerned. Is that good to be able to do? She feels like she can\u2019t shut up about the vet tech she\u2019s been on three dates with.\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Yuuri says, apologizing unnecessarily. \u201cVictor will be back. We lost track of time and he\u2019s particular about his looks.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell he was in Vanity Fair,\u201d Mark shrugs.\n\n\u201cOh, you looked him up? He\u2019s in lots of magazines. That\u2019s kind of why we got messed up today.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, busybodies needed to know about Victor Nikiforov even though he\u2019s a washed-up coach,\u201d Yuri scoffs.\n\n\u201cYuratchka, he\u2019s your coach. And get off the counter,\u201d Yuuri scolds, tugging the boy down and, clearly just to be annoying, ruffling his long hair.\n\n\u201cWow, cool, dad,\u201d Yuri replies, flicking his hair back. Yuuri smiles after Yuri, full of love as the boy skulks off to play on his phone on the living room couch. Yuuri fixes his attention on Mark and Ky once more, tapping the frame of his glasses to fix a crookedness that isn\u2019t there.\n\n\u201cWould you like a tour?\u201d he offers, spreading his hands theatrically.\n\n\nEveryone\u2019s ravenous when Victor returns with several cartons of Indian takeout. It gets spread across the island and they go round like a buffet with their plates but eat in a dining room. Yuuri clucks around Yuri and encourages him to eat, eat!\n\nVictor leans towards Ky and Mark, hand walled around his lips for secrecy: \u201cOur Yura counts calories too much. But I was like him too once.\u201d He winks meaningfully before stealing a piece of lamb of Yuuri\u2019s plate and stuffing it in his mouth. \u201cBut I can eat whatever I want now! Like all of Yuuri\u2018s cooking.\u201d\n\nYuuri pokes him in the cheek, smile small.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re lucky,\u201d Ky acknowledges. \u201cYuuri lets us try the lunches he brings when we don\u2019t recognize the food.\u201d\n\nVictor lays a hand over his heart, big-eyed and mouth a snoozed heart. \u201cTell me everything my Yuuri does at school. He\u2019s quietest about himself.\u201d\n\n\nVictor\u2019s a lot. He\u2019s loud and kind of an attention whore, but he also seems to love putting the attention on Yuuri as well. He laments Yuuri\u2019s modesty.\n\n\u201cEven when he was Japan\u2019s number one skater, he acted like a nobody,\u201d Victor cries. \u201cHe broke my world record, you know, for the free skate. I never did get it back.\u201d He doesn\u2019t seem bothered by this past a contemplative downturn of his lips.\n\nYuri at every chance, drags him in the mud: \u201cYou act like you also didn\u2019t know who he was when you met. I knew him way better.\u201d\n\nYuuri oscillates between protesting all of this and eating with his head down, putting away the champagne like a champion.\n\nKy and Mark are more than happy for once to be on the receiving end of all things Katsuki-Nikiforov. They gush about Yuuri when they can. Victor seems to know everything about them that they\u2019ve told Yuuri, which both flatters and despairs them. Victor asks after Ky\u2019s new lovebird Tianna; he even congratulates Mark\u2019s little brother Mamadou on getting accepted to university! He asks them particular questions about their studies, what they think about American education, as natives, all this thoughtful stuff. Every time Victor talks, Yuuri looks at him gratefully, for both Victor\u2019s social grace and for proof of Victor\u2019s devotion to this new part of his life. All this time, Yuuri had been learning about them, and they hadn\u2019t done enough to poke past his humble private defenses.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting an earful now,\u201d Yuuri says in response to this observation. \u201cAnd I did it on purpose, anyway.\u201d\n\nMark\u2019s decidedly sure that Victor is fondling him under the table because Victor looks devious and Yuuri is squirming. Ky already texted him her thoughts on the turtlenecks and Yuuri\u2019s sex hair.\n\n\u201cDo you want to hear about how we met?\u201d Victor purrs, chin in hand and leaning towards his innocent guests. The light catches on his wedding band and it throws off a spark ominously.\n\n\u201cOh god, not this crap,\u201d Yuri whines. \u201cStop embarrassing Katsudon, you\u2019re gonna kill him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s Katsudon?\u201d Mark finally asks, sparring Yuuri who looks like he\u2019s going to combust from whatever epic secret set his life on a course to this finale.\n\n\u201cA pork cutlet bowl,\u201c Yuri explain, weirdly engaged. \u201cIt\u2019s fried pork over rice. It\u2019s really good but sooooo many calories. No skater should ever eat it during the season. It makes everyone fat. Yuuri was all fat from it when we found him. He taught me how to make it when I lived in Japan and then my grandpa,\u201d there\u2019s the slightest hitch in Yuri\u2019s voice. Yuuri and Victor seem to sober instantly and straighten in their seats, \u201cmy grandpa learned to make it into pirozhki. Do you know what that is?\u201d\n\nMark and Ky shake their heads on cue. Yuri\u2019s animated, a little red in the face from food and the second glass of champagne that Victor had snuck him.\u00a0 \u201cPirozhki is a bun filled with foods, like meat.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo\u2026a dumpling? A meat bun?\u201d Mark says.\n\n\u201cYes, but better. Russian. Pirozhki,\u201d Yuri insists. \u00a0\n\nMark nods. Yuuri and Victor let out a quiet sigh in tandem and share a look that their guests can\u2019t discern. The \u2018dads\u2019 take the chance to bring Yuri into the fold, proudly exclaiming over the work he\u2019s been done and asking for Ky and Mark\u2019s opinions on few colleges, even though Yuri swears he\u2019s not going and \u201cbesides, Victor, you barely graduated high school.\u201d\n\nThe evening passes in a bizarre dream that Ky and Mark struggle to remember by the stroke of eleven. Oh, so late! Wow, truly! Everyone hugs. There\u2019s a lot of hugging and back patting and handshaking.\n\n\u201cThank you for coming over.\u201d Yuuri repeats for the hundredth time that night. Victor, who\u2019s supposed to be cleaning up the kitchen, instead joins his husband, the most demure he\u2019s been all night, wrapping an arm around Yuuri\u2019s waist. He\u2019s smiling, looking at Yuuri proudly, all affection, all of him laid bare to Ky and Mark.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to make new friends,\u201d Yuuri finishes quietly. It\u2019s like a blow to the stomach. Ky kisses his cheek and hugs Victor again. Yuuri sends them home with the leftover Indian food.\n\n\n\u201cDo you wanna go back to my place and get shitfaced and deconstruct the night?\u201d Mark offers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never wanted to be gay-married before but that made me a believer,\u201d Ky says as way of confirmation.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s, you know, inaccurate to, what\u2019s that quote: judge your life by someone else\u2019s highlight reel? Something like that. But I just feel,\u201d Ky blabbers from her slumped position on Mark\u2019s beat-up couch that she\u2019s mostly sure Mark found off the side of the freeway, \u201cI just feel so good but sad? Like, full of hope for love but also I really want love right this second?\u201d\n\nMark pats her foot companionably when he sets down, passing her another beer. \u201cKy, you\u2019re twenty-three. I\u2019m twenty-four. We have plenty of time.\u201d\n\nShe sniffs and wipes under her eyes carefully for mascara. \u201cWhy are you handling this so well? You\u2019re the one whose crush got crushed.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t remind me,\u201d Mark mutters, taking a long pull from his beer. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It was a crush. And Yuuri is, well it\u2019s still him, he\u2019s not different in nature than the Yuuri we knew of a few days ago. But he\u2019s got a whole story with Victor we didn\u2019t know. I like it. I feel\u2026fulfilled tangentially to them. Besides, Victor said he wants me to show him the clubs around here. That Chris guy Yuuri mentioned? He\u2019s supposed to visit soon with his fiance and they need to know the scene. Maybe I\u2019ll find my husband blackout drunk pole dancing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s so inspiring,\u201d Ky whispers. They don\u2018t even have the TV or the living room lights on, and the dark and the quiet eases their bodies. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s too late for me to text Tianna?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never too late for anything,\u201d Mark says sagely. Ky side-eyes him, flutters an eye roll and pulls out her phone."
