    "text": "Peter wakes up dizzy and hurting all over.\nThe world has gone sideways and for a heartbeat or two, he can\u2019t make sense of what he\u2019s seeing. Then he realizes, no- he\u2019s gone sideways. His shoulder and face are pressed uncomfortably into an unforgiving concrete floor. He feels stiff, sore like he hasn\u2019t moved in a long time. He tries to raise his hands, touch his face, verify that his mask is still in place, but he doesn\u2019t get very far. His hands are bound tightly behind his back. Everything smells like blood.\nHe struggles into a sitting position. His vision swims. He feels\u2026 drugged. Weak and heavy-lidded. He can\u2019t remember how he got here.\nHe looks around, hoping to get his bearings. It looks like he\u2019s in an old warehouse. Pale sunlight is streaming in through skylights in the ceiling, illuminating\u2026 Well, not much of anything. Dust-covered cement floors and bits of trash lying around. Nothing is familiar.\nIt looks like people are milling about at the far end of the room, near the entrance. They\u2019re far enough away that Peter can\u2019t tell exactly how many there are or hear anything they\u2019re saying if they're saying anything at all. A few of them have guns, some holstered and some not. Knowing that should put Peter on edge but the only feeling he\u2019s able to dredge up out of the fog that is currently his brain is one of utmost weariness. He feels like he could tip over and go back to sleep.\nSo, definitely drugged, then.\nHe opens his mouth. He\u2019s not sure what for. Maybe to call out to the armed strangers, but that would be a bad idea, wouldn\u2019t it? He realizes this a half a second before he follows through and snaps his mouth shut. It turns out not to matter because at that moment a distraction provides itself.\nThere\u2019s a loud banging on the door. From the other side, someone yells loudly enough for Peter to hear even from as far away as he is, which is impressive. All the strangers turn toward the noise as one, each of them tense, hands flying to weapons, which tells Peter that they weren\u2019t expecting company.\nA second later, a shot rings out, then another, and another, and then all the strangers are firing at once and all Peter can hear is a cacophony of gunfire. He hears bullets pinging off metal walls, striking flesh, spent shells and casings falling to the ground. The noise makes his head hurt. He closes his eyes, just for a second, or so it seems, and when he opens them again the strangers are all on the ground, limbs splayed and weapons abandoned. Standing amidst the bodies, sword drawn and dripping red, is Deadpool.\nPeter knows he\u2019s pretty out of it but he\u2019d recognize the crazed mercenary anywhere. He\u2019s only dealt directly with the man a handful of times but his iconic getup is hard to mistake. If there were any doubt, the way he skips toward Peter and yells, \u201cSpidey! There\u2019s my baby boy,\u201d would be enough to confirm it. Peter is pretty sure no one else has ever called him baby boy, even in jest.\n\u201cWhat are-\u201c Peter stops. His voice sounds wrecked and his mouth is dry. He clears his throat and tries again. \u201cWhat\u2019re you doing here, Deadpool?\u201d A little better, but still slurred. There\u2019s blackness creeping in around the edges of his vision, which even he can tell probably isn\u2019t good.\nDeadpool reaches him between one blink and the next. The mercenary kneels in front of him, head tilted to the side. There are bullet holes punched in his suit. \u201cAw, Spidey, what\u2019d they do to you? Your suit\u2019s all torn! And I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s your blood.\u201d\nBlood? Peter looks down at himself and- oh. Right. He\u2019d smelled blood earlier and there it is, seeping slowly from a wound in his side. He tries to place his palm over it but the bindings pull at his wrists and he\u2019s reminded abruptly that he\u2019s still tied up. Great.\n\u201cNever fear,\u201d Deadpool says, standing just long enough to strike a heroic pose. \u201cDeadpool is here!\u201d The effect is somewhat ruined by the fact that he\u2019s also covered in blood. Probably the blood of all the people he just killed, which Peter makes a mental note to berate him for later. Right now he\u2019s too tired.\n\u201cYou\u2019re awfully quiet today,\u201d Deadpool comments, kneeling once more to cut the ropes binding him. Peter didn\u2019t see where he pulled the knife from and doesn\u2019t see where it disappears to once he\u2019s finished using it. Peter\u2019s shoulders scream in relief as he\u2019s able to roll them forward. His entire body is so stiff and sore that he can only muster a grunt of protest as Deadpool scoops him into his arms and starts to carry him bridal-style toward the entrance.\n\u201cSorry, sorry,\u201d Deadpool mutters, half under his breath. \u201cIt\u2019s just- you don\u2019t seem like you can walk and actually you seem pretty out of it- but I probably should\u2019ve asked you if I could pick you up, huh? Shit. \u2018S too late now. Wait, where should I take you? To the Avengers? But they\u2019ll yell at me. Do you have a Spidey Cave somewhere? Huh? Spider-Man?\u201d\nPeter rests his head against Deadpool\u2019s shoulder and doesn\u2019t answer. The man smells like gun powder. He always smells like gun powder. And he\u2019s so warm. Is he always this warm?\nPeter drifts off while Deadpool is still rambling. He\u2019s pretty sure the last word he hears before he gives in to the blackness is tacos.\n-\nLater, consciousness hits Peter in the face like a sledgehammer. One second he\u2019s blissfully unaware, the next he\u2019s sitting bolt upright on a sofa and feeling every blow he\u2019s ever taken all at once. He\u2019s not sure how long he sits there clutching the armrest and staring blankly at the floor. Long enough to mentally catalog all his new injuries. There's the uncomfortable twinge in his ankle, probably from landing on it wrong, the various aches in his back and arms and legs where he undoubtedly sustained a few kicks or punches, the throbbing in his head and along his jaw, and the burn of a cut along his side.\nThat one hurts the worst, though when Peter looks down at it he\u2019s surprised to see that it\u2019s been bandaged. Just enough of his suit has been torn away to get at the wound. The rest of it, he finds, has been left alone, including his mask which remains firmly in place. He breathes a sigh of relief as his fingers find the edge of it at his throat.\n\u201cSpider pal! You\u2019re awake!\u201d Deadpool is standing in the doorway, paper bag clutched in one hand, half-eaten taco in the other. He\u2019s still spattered with blood, now dry and turning brown.\nPeter gives a weary nod. \u201cHow long was I out?\u201d\nDeadpool plops himself down in the nearest armchair, a ratty green thing that was either just rescued from a trash heap or belongs in one. \u201cOnly about twenty, twenty-five minutes. Probably. Just long enough for me to fix you up and get some tacos. Guess you\u2019ve got a little healing factor too, huh? Anyone else would\u2019ve been out for hours on the stuff they gave you.\u201d\n\u201cA little, yeah,\u201d Peter hedges. \u201cI take it this is your place?\u201d\nIt\u2019s hard to tell with the mask on but the way Deadpool palms at the back of his neck suggests a certain amount of sheepishness. \u201cUh, yep. Welcome to the Deadhut. Or one of them, anyway. Mi casa, su casa. And all that.\u201d\nThe so-called Deadhut is kind of a mess but then Peter didn\u2019t really expect much else. It could use a good dusting and a broom and there\u2019s a lot of clutter, random things like magazines, video games, books, knitting needles and yarn, bullets, knives, a spatula, toy cars, and stuffed animals, among other things. The paint on the walls is peeling and faded, a fact which the various posters that are pinned up do nothing to draw attention from. The floors are bare concrete and the furniture couldn\u2019t clash more if Deadpool had planned it that way. Hell, maybe he did plan it that way.\nBut\u2026 it\u2019s not terrible. Kind of cozy, in a strange way. Not like Peter\u2019s apartment, which feels empty and cold no matter how much time he spends there. This place feels lived in, which is funny since Peter is reasonably sure that Deadpool doesn\u2019t spend even half his time in New York.\nPeter clears his throat. \u201cDid you, um\u2026\u201d He gestures at his own face, hoping Deadpool understands what he\u2019s getting at. \u201cWhile I was out, did you\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cDid I\u2026? Oh, your mask? Nah, man, come on. I\u2019d never do that! Definitely crosses a line, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\nPeter has no real reason to believe him but he feels relieved nonetheless. Deadpool has a few screws loose but he wouldn\u2019t betray Spider-Man that way, would he? He\u2019s made no secret of how much he looks up to him.\n\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d Deadpool presses when Peter doesn\u2019t comment. \u201cYou hungry? Got enough for us to share.\u201d He brandishes the paper bag.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Peter lies. This is, after all, Deadpool, and Peter doesn\u2019t trust him, not after all the stories he\u2019s heard, and if you don\u2019t trust someone, you don\u2019t accept food from them, right? \u201cI feel\u2026 better. I think. How\u2019d you find me?\u201d\n\u201cI saw you get taken,\u201d Deadpool says. He hasn\u2019t eaten any more of his taco, Peter can\u2019t help but notice. \u201cSo I just, you know. Followed the baddies. Took me straight to where they were holding you. Which- warehouse? I mean, how fucking clich\u00e9, right?\u201d\nPeter rubs at his temples. His head is still throbbing but it\u2019s fading by the minute. Now his skin is starting to itch under his mask. He probably bled and now it\u2019s dried and cracking. \u201cSo what happened? I remember most of it. I was trying to stop a bank robbery. Big job, lots of mooks in ski masks. Then it gets a little fuzzy.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I heard the commotion from a few streets over. Got there just in time to see you get knocked on the head. Then you got a little wobbly on your feet, some guy got a needle in you, and the next thing I knew you were being stuffed in a shady-looking van and driven across town. They were asking for ransom. How weird is that? I think the bank job was bait, though, to lure you out, but I didn\u2019t let the leader guy live long enough to find out for sure-\u201c\n\u201cRansom from who?\u201d Peter interrupts, startled. His Aunt May? They\u2019d have to know his identity if that was the case.\n\u201cThe Avengers,\u201d Deadpool tells him, the word accompanied with a grand hand gesture. \u201cSo fucking stupid, right? All they did was risk pissing them off. But the leader, he wasn\u2019t real bright. You could tell just looking at him. One of those guys who thinks it\u2019s cool to wear socks with sandals.\u201d\n\u201cSo\u2026 did they get word to the Avengers?\u201d\n\u201cNah, I think I offed them all before they got the chance.\u201d\n\u201cWhy? Why did you even bother?\u201d Peter wonders, though he\u2019s partly relieved. The last thing he needs is the Avengers thinking he can\u2019t handle himself. He feels bad enough already about losing a fight with a bunch of randoms. Not even a super villain, just a group of normal guys with guns and drugs strong enough to knock him out. He\u2019s been off his game lately. Between school, work, and being Spider-Man, it\u2019s been hard to find enough hours in the day to sleep properly.\nDeadpool tilts his head, once again doing his best impression of a confused puppy. Peter imagines he\u2019s looking quite earnest behind that mask. \u201cThey hurt you, Spidey. So they had to pay.\u201d\nPeter shakes his head. \u201cI- that\u2019s not- you shouldn\u2019t have killed them.\u201d\n\u201cThey were bad guys and they hurt you. Even after you were unconscious. They must\u2019ve because I know you weren\u2019t that banged up when they first got you. I had to rescue you. I did rescue you.\u201d\n\u201cThere was a better way. There\u2019s always a better way. You didn\u2019t have to-\u201c\nDeadpool has gone very, very still in his chair. He\u2019s taken to gripping the armrest. Hard.\nPeter sighs. \u201cYou did rescue me,\u201d he says, slowly. \u201cAnd I\u2019m grateful. Thank you, Deadpool.\u201d\nDeadpool instantly brightens. \u201cAny time, Spider-Man!\u201d\nPeter struggles to his feet but it\u2019s easy enough to find his footing once he works the soreness out of his legs. His ankle complains when he puts too much weight on it but he\u2019s had worse before. It\u2019s nothing he can\u2019t manage.\n\u201cLeaving already?\u201d Deadpool pouts, watching as Peter moves toward the window. He stands, too, tacos left in the chair.\n\u201cGotta get home,\u201d Peter says. He pushes the window up and glances around to get a sense of where he is. Though Deadpool claimed he was only out for about twenty minutes it\u2019s somehow already pitch black outside. There aren\u2019t very many people around, which is good. Fewer people to see him leaving this apartment. \u201cIt\u2019s Monday, right? That\u2019s when they re-run Golden Girls.\u201d\nHe\u2019s joking (mostly- who doesn\u2019t love a bit of Golden Girls?) but, behind him, Deadpool gasps. \u201cYou like Golden Girls? I think I\u2019m in love. Marry me, Spider-Man!\u201d\nPeter rolls his eyes. When he turns, he catches Deadpool staring at his ass and making grabby hands. This earns him another eye roll which, unfortunately, he can\u2019t even see. \u201cNever in a million years,\u201d he decides. \u201cBesides, I\u2019d look terrible in a wedding dress.\u201d\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll wear the dress! I\u2019ve got the legs for it.\u201d Deadpool strikes a ridiculous pose and Peter, despite all his aches and pains, actually finds himself laughing. It\u2019s short-lived, mostly because it pulls at the wound in his side, but it\u2019s enough that Deadpool hears. He coos, \u201cDon\u2019t you have just the cutest laugh? You should laugh more, Spidey!\u201d\nPeter frowns. \u201cI laugh plenty,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re just not around to hear it.\u201d Once the words are out Peter realizes they sound an awful lot like some kind of invitation and wishes he could take them back. There\u2019s a pause where Deadpool seems to be trying to decide on how to reply.\nThankfully he settles on a simple and non-awkward response of, \u201cWhatever, everyone could use a little more laughter in their life. Even spider-themed superheroes.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026 guess that\u2019s true,\u201d Peter admits. He clears his throat. \u201cUm, thanks again, Deadpool. I owe you one.\u201d He holds out his hand for a friendly shake. It seems like the right thing to do.\nDeadpool hums. \u201cYou do, don\u2019t you,\u201d he says, taking the proffered hand. Peter can\u2019t help but notice that Deadpool\u2019s hand dwarfs his own. Granted, he\u2019s wearing thicker gloves, but still. \u201cSay, Spider-Man,\u201d Deadpool begins. He still isn\u2019t letting go of Peter\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019ve got this\u2026 mission tomorrow. Could really use your help.\u201d\n\u201cOh, no, wait a minute,\u201d Peter says. He goes to pull his hand away and for a moment it seems like Deadpool isn\u2019t going to let him have it back but when Peter keeps pulling he gives in and releases it. \u201cI don\u2019t kill people, Deadpool. I\u2019m not gonna tag along on any merc business.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not!\u201d Deadpool shakes his head. \u201cNo merc business, promise! Just a little thing. And if you get there and decide it\u2019s not for you, you can walk away! No hard feelings. Promise. Scout\u2019s honor.\u201d\nOn the one hand, Peter wouldn\u2019t say he\u2019s exactly eager to spend any more time in the mercenary\u2019s company. On the other, he does owe the man and Peter doesn\u2019t like being in debt to anyone but especially not semi-insane anti-heroes. \u201cThere won\u2019t be any killing? No thieving? No morally ambiguous anything?\u201d\n\u201cNope!\u201d\nPeter gives in with a sigh. \u201cAlright, fine. But I\u2019ve got\u2026\u201d He very nearly says school, but quickly rewords himself. \u201cStuff. To do. So I can\u2019t meet you until tomorrow night.\u201d\n\u201cWorks for me! Meet ya here?\u201d\nPeter glances out the window again. \u201cYeah, I think I can find my way back.\u201d\n\u201cGreat! See you tomorrow, Spidey! Be careful out there. No more abductions! Would hate to have to rescue you again!\u201d\nThis last part is yelled out the window as Peter swings away on a web. He rolls his eyes- something Deadpool makes him do a lot- but he\u2019s also smiling under the mask.\n-\n\u201cOw, ow, ow,\u201d Peter mutters as he carefully peels his suit off. It seems like every inch of the suit reveals a new bruise. Evidently, the men who captured him earlier had a vendetta against Spider-Man- a vendetta they enacted with kicks and punches to an unconscious victim.\nPeter stands in front of the mirror while he removes his mask, almost afraid at what he\u2019ll find beneath it. He was right about the blood. There\u2019s some caked on his chin, where his lip split, and on his cheek, where he suffered a minor cut. Other than that there\u2019s some bruising, mostly around his eye. The one on his cheekbone has already faded to yellow, which means that by morning it should be gone completely.\nIt\u2019s with some trepidation that he peels away the bandage on his side, but the cut isn\u2019t looking too bad. It would seem that along with slapping a bandage over it, Deadpool also took the time to clean and disinfect the wound, which is something else he has to be grateful for, then.\nPeter squints at himself in the mirror. The Avengers wouldn\u2019t like him hanging around with someone like Deadpool. He\u2019s heard Tony complain about the merc more than once, but Deadpool helped him today. Even the Avengers would have to agree that Peter owes him a debt, right? There\u2019s nothing wrong with repaying that debt, so long as it\u2019s harmless, which Deadpool had assured him it will be.\nThen again, does Deadpool even know the meaning of the word harmless? He\u2019s crazy. That\u2019s one thing everyone that\u2019s worked with him or even spent five minutes in the same room with him seems to agree on. Today, though, he\u2019d seemed\u2026 bizarre, but lucid. Maybe Peter just caught him on a good day?\nPeter pinches the bridge of his nose. \u201cShit,\u201d he mutters, which he thinks sums up his feelings rather nicely.\nHe needs a bath, he abruptly decides. Not only is he filthy but he\u2019s carried Deadpool\u2019s smell home with him. After a bath, he\u2019ll study, and then, if there\u2019s time, sleep.\nThere\u2019s a part of him that\u2019s very anxious indeed to see what Deadpool has in store for him tomorrow.\n\u201cThis is the mission? Ice cream?\u201d\nDeadpool thrusts out a vanilla cone, silently urging Peter to take it. \u201cNo, no. This is just pre-game. I got vanilla cause I didn\u2019t know what kind you\u2019d like and it seemed safe but please tell me vanilla isn\u2019t your favorite, it\u2019s so boring.\u201d His own ice cream is about six different colors and smells like fruit.\nInstead of meeting in Deadpool\u2019s apartment, Deadpool had been waiting for Spider-Man on the roof, so now here they sit, legs dangling over the edge. Peter takes his ice cream with a great deal of hesitation. What if it\u2019s poisoned? Is he being paranoid? Probably. If Deadpool wanted him dead, he could\u2019ve just offed him yesterday. Still\u2026\n\u201cI like vanilla but it\u2019s not my favorite,\u201d he says, abruptly deciding to bite the bullet (or, in this case, lick the ice cream). He pushes his mask up to his nose and adds, \u201cMy favorite is actually chocolate chip.\u201d\nDeadpool scoffs. \u201cThat\u2019s just as bad,\u201d he declares. \u201cFucking chocolate chip. That\u2019s just boring with sprinkles-\u201c He stops talking. \nPeter freezes, immediately on alert. He looks over but Deadpool is just staring at him, or past him. It\u2019s hard to tell with the mask but when Peter looks behind himself there\u2019s nothing there. \u201cUh,\u201d he starts, but evidently Deadpool finds his on-switch again because he interrupts.\n\u201cHow old are you?\u201d he blurts.\nPeter has a very quick internal debate about whether or not to share the truth, then decides he might as well. There\u2019s very little someone can do with an age. \u201cTwenty.\u201d He adds, eye roll practically audible, \u201cSo don\u2019t worry, you can continue to ogle my ass guilt-free.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Deadpool says, and Peter has to mentally backtrack.\n\u201cI mean- I meant to say-\u201c\n\u201cNope, too late!\u201d Deadpool says, jabbing a victorious finger toward Peter\u2019s face. \u201cYou said it, the whole world heard it! I get to stare at your butt whenever I feel like it!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I said,\u201d Peter argues, but he\u2019s smiling so he\u2019s not sure how effective it is. \u201cAnd you\u2019re the only one here so I don\u2019t think the whole world heard-\u201c\n\u201cNo take backs!\u201d\nPeter chuckles and goes back to eating his ice cream, silently admitting defeat. He has a feeling that most arguments with Deadpool can\u2019t be won.\nOut of the corner of his eye, Peter sees Deadpool reach for the bottom of his mask and then hesitate, fingering the edge of it. Peter tries to seem wholly engrossed in his own ice cream, even going so far as to angle his body slightly away. One of the small handful of things Peter knows about the mercenary is that he\u2019s scarred, apparently pretty badly, though no one can seem to agree on the cause or the extent of the scarring. They all agree on one thing, though- Deadpool hates being seen without his mask.\n\u201cGood stuff,\u201d Deadpool says a moment later. Peter dares to look over. Deadpool\u2019s ice cream cone is gone and his mask is back in place. Behind him, the sun is just starting to set and New York City is just starting to light up.\n\u201cWhat the- how\u2019d you finish so fast?\u201d\nDeadpool shrugs. \u201cPractice.\u201d\nPeter takes another pointed bite out of his cone. \u201cWell, us normal people have to contend with brain freeze.\u201d\nDeadpool kicks his legs against the side of the building. \u201cTake your time, baby boy, there\u2019s no rush.\u201d\nThe next few minutes are filled with companionable silence, something Peter didn\u2019t even know Deadpool was capable of. The mercenary seems lost in thought, eyes tracing the skyline and fingers tapping an uneven rhythm against the roof.\n\u201cPenny for your thoughts?\u201d Peter says, softly, almost hesitant to interrupt whatever is going on in his head.\n\u201cWhat kinda girl do you take me for?\u201d Deadpool teases, snapping out of it. \u201cThey cost way more than a penny.\u201d\nPeter recognizes it for the evasion it is and chooses not to comment. He and Deadpool aren\u2019t\u2026 friends, by any stretch of the imagination. He has no right to pry.\n\u201cYour suit\u2019s all back in one piece,\u201d Deadpool notes. \u201cHow many of those have you got hanging in your spider closet back home, anyway?\u201d\n\u201cHow many do you have?\u201d Peter counters.\n\u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d\nPeter licks his lips, clearing them of ice cream. Deadpool watches with a strange sort of intensity. Peter clears his throat. He\u2019s not sure what Deadpool finds so fascinating. It\u2019s just- his face. Not even his entire face, just a piece of it. Little does Deadpool know that under the rest of the mask he looks like a tired, disheveled mess. This morning, thanks to a lack of sleep, there\u2019d been bags under his eyes in addition to his now-fading bruises. \u201cYou wanna tell me what this mission is all about now?\u201d Peter asks, deflecting attention. \u201cIs that what this is, a briefing?\u201d\n\u201cNope!\u201d Deadpool sounds like he\u2019s probably grinning beneath his mask. \u201cThe mission is a surprise! Don\u2019t you just love surprises? It\u2019s like Christmas!\u201d\n\u201cBut you promise it\u2019s nothing shady?\u201d\n\u201cYes, Spidey. God. It\u2019s like you don\u2019t trust me or something. But I\u2019d never lie to you. Mislead you, maybe. Fib a little here and there. But lying\u2019s not my bag, you dig?\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s reassuring,\u201d Peter deadpans.\nIf Deadpool picks up on the sarcasm, he doesn\u2019t let on. \u201cYeah, so, no worries. No one is gonna get hurt today. I promise. I know you\u2019ve got a reputation to uphold and all that.\u201d\nPeter pops the last of his cone into his mouth and tugs his mask back down. He just hopes he\u2019s doing the right thing here.\n-\nThe house Deadpool leads him to is a bit on the run-down side and decidedly not in the nicest part of town, but there are discarded toys on the lawn and children playing further down the street. Peter\u2019s spidey sense is quiet and he has no reason to suspect a trap.\n\u201cDamn, looks like we missed the party,\u201d Deadpool murmurs.\nThe sun is fully set now, leaving them and their surroundings illuminated only by a lone street lamp and what little moonlight can creep through the clouds. Deadpool pulls him to a stop in the middle of the front lawn, fingers curled around his wrist. The touch lingers as he explains, quickly, all in one breath, \u201cThe older one is Emily, the younger one is Sarah. It\u2019s Emily\u2019s birthday today. All you have to do is smile and play nice. That\u2019s the mission. Got it? Got it.\u201d\nPeter blinks. \u201cI- what? What are you-\u201c\n\u201cOh, and here,\u201d Deadpool adds, shoving a small, wrapped gift into his hands. \u201cYou\u2019ll need this.\u201d\nThe present is way too big to fit into one of Deadpool\u2019s pouches. \u201cWhere were you even hiding that?\u201d Peter asks, mildly disturbed at the possibilities.\nThe porch light flicks on and the front door squeaks open. \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d calls a woman\u2019s voice, high and nervous.\nThe pressure of Deadpool\u2019s hand on his wrist is gone and, Peter is unsurprised to find when he turns back, so is Deadpool. Peter could easily make himself disappear as well, as the woman hasn\u2019t even seen him yet, but if this is how Deadpool wants the debt repaid then so be it.\nPeter clears his throat and steps forward into the light. He puts on his best hero voice (they all have one, even if people like Tony Stark would deny it). \u201cIt\u2019s just me,\u201d he says. \u201cYour friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.\u201d\n\u201cOh, my God,\u201d says the woman, swinging the door wide and squinting at him. She has her blonde hair pulled up in a messy, drooping bun and there are dark circles under her eyes, but after a quick study of his suit, she looks genuinely amazed- and pleased- to see him. \u201cIs it really you?\u201d\n\u201cThe one and only,\u201d he assures her.\n\u201cOh- hang on. Let me fetch the girls. Come, come, wait by the door,\u201d she instructs, the wariness gone completely from her voice, replaced by excitement. \u201cEmily, Sarah!\u201d She disappears for a moment around the corner and returns not five minutes later, this time accompanied by two young girls. The oldest- Emily, Peter presumes- couldn\u2019t be more than seven or eight, while the youngest looks about five. They\u2019re wearing matching blue and white checkered dresses and have their hair pulled into pigtails. Sarah\u2019s face is streaked with dirt.\nSarah is the first to react to his presence. She gasps, comically huge, and launches herself at him. \u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201d she squeals.\nPeter intercepts the would-be hug to twirl her around, which sets her off giggling. \u201cHello, Sarah,\u201d he greets once he sets her down, kneeling so they\u2019re at eye level. \u201cAnd Emily.\u201d\nEmily is staring, eyes wide. She tiptoes forward slowly like she isn\u2019t sure she\u2019s allowed. Peter presents her with the gift. \u201cI heard it\u2019s your birthday today.\u201d\nIt\u2019s her turn to gasp. She takes the present in a hurry but then takes care when she removes the bow. She casts around for where to put it before she decides to stick it to the front of her own dress. The wrapping paper itself doesn\u2019t receive the same consideration. As she tears into it to get at the gift, Peter silently prays it isn\u2019t anything too weird. Or dangerous. Or lethal. But these are kids. Surely even Deadpool wouldn\u2019t hurt a kid?\nHis faith in the mercenary is rewarded when Emily discards the last of the paper and removes a small book. Peter isn\u2019t able to get a glimpse of the title but Emily seems thrilled. She clutches it to her chest, looking awed. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d she asks.\n\u201cI\u2019m Spider-Man,\u201d seems the only fitting explanation.\nEmily nods, like this makes perfect sense. She hugs him, one small arm wrapped around his shoulders. \u201cThank you, Spider-Man.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re our favorite hero!\u201d Sarah declares once Emily steps back. She wraps her tiny fingers around his thumb and tugs him toward the door. \u201cYou have to come have cake!\u201d\nTheir mother laughs. She\u2019s looking warmly at the three of them from the doorway. \u201cSarah, you have to ask if he wants cake.\u201d\nSarah nods. She looks up at him with big, blue eyes and asks very seriously, \u201cDo you want cake, Spider-Man? We have a ton of leftovers.\u201d\n\u201cOh, um\u2026\u201d Peter casts around, looking for Deadpool, but the man is still nowhere to be found. \u201cI should really-\u201c\nEmily is still holding the book like she\u2019s never going to let it go. \u201cPlease?\u201d she says simply.\nPeter folds immediately. \u201cAlright, I guess I have a little free time.\u201d\nSarah cheers and Emily lights up and Peter feels pretty damn good about his decision.\n\u201cI have some questions about the webs,\u201d Sarah says seriously as she drags him into the house.\n-\nDeadpool is waiting on the street for him when he exits the house some twenty minutes later, full of cake and having been thoroughly questioned about everything from his choice of color scheme to the inner workings of the criminal mind and back around to his favorite boyband. Deadpool is just a silhouette against the night sky until Peter reaches him. He\u2019s twirling a knife between his fingers. Every so often the blade catches the light.\nFor a moment, when Peter draws even with him, they just stand there looking at each other. It\u2019s Peter who breaks the silence. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Sarah is going to be President one day,\u201d he says.\nDeadpool hums his agreement. \u201cShe\u2019s smart as a whip, that one.\u201d\n\u201cWanna tell me what that was all about now?\u201d\nWith one last flick of his wrist, Deadpool makes the knife vanish. \u201cThanks, Spidey,\u201d he says, ignoring the question. \u201cKnew you\u2019d be good with kids. You just have that vibe, you know? Just screams kid friendly and PG.\u201d\n\u201cSeriously,\u201d Peter presses, trying not to let him weasel his way out of answering. \u201cWho was that family? Was that- wait. Are you their dad?\u201d\nDeadpool holds up his hands, vigorously shakes his head. \u201cNo, no no no. No kids in this universe. Uh, that I know of, anyway. If there is one, we haven\u2019t met yet.\u201d\n\u201cOkay\u2026 so who were they?\u201d\nDeadpool scratches at his chin through the mask. \u201cThey\u2019re\u2026 I used to know their dad,\u201d he says slowly, probably debating with himself as he goes about what exactly he should reveal. Peter knows the feeling. \u201cHe was in Weapon X with me. He\u2026 told me a lot about them before he died, and I know since he\u2019s been gone they\u2019ve had it pretty rough. I just figured having their favorite superhero drop by would be nice.\u201d He shrugs.\n\u201cAnd the book?\u201d\n\u201cUm.. he used to read it to her when she was little. Like a bedtime story or something. But they lost their copy when they moved.\u201d\n\u201cHuh,\u201d Peter says, briefly at a loss.\n\u201cYep,\u201d Deadpool says, popping the p. He turns on his heel and starts off down the sidewalk.\nPeter, trailing a short distance behind, studies the line of Deadpool\u2019s shoulders and finds himself, for the first time, actually curious about the mercenary\u2019s past. He\u2019d thought he knew everything he needed to know- that Deadpool was a part of Weapon X, that he had a healing factor to rival that of Wolverine, that he was scarred and psychologically damaged (to say the least about his fluctuating mental state)- but now he\u2019s thinking maybe those are all just facts on a page. They don\u2019t really tell him anything about who Deadpool is, at his core, or what he\u2019s been through.\n\u201cSo you can consider us even now,\u201d Deadpool says into the ensuing silence.\nPeter jogs a bit to catch up. \u201cHey,\u201d he says, deliberately bumping their shoulders together. \u201cYou know I\u2019d have done that for free. All you had to do was tell me what the deal was.\u201d\nDeadpool shakes his head. \u201cSpider-Man doesn\u2019t have time to visit every little girl or boy that wants to meet him. I know you\u2019re a busy guy, what with all the world-saving and crime-stopping.\u201d\n\u201cStill, I\u2019d have done it.\u201d\n\u201cNah. Not many heroes who\u2019d do a favor for the \u2018merc with a mouth\u2019,\u201d here he employs air quotes. \u201cIt\u2019s cool, though. It all worked out.\u201d\n\u201cI would have,\u201d Peter insists. \u201cI\u2019d have done it anyway. Which means\u2026\u201d He pauses, bites his lip, then plows on. \u201cWhich means we\u2019re still not even. That wasn\u2019t a favor for you, Deadpool, that was a favor for them.\u201d\n\u201cSame thing-\u201c\n\u201cIt\u2019s not! I still owe you.\u201d\nDeadpool looks at him. \u201cSo I still have a spider-favor to cash in?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. But still, you know, no killing. No merc business. But if you ever need my help with something that\u2019s not terrible\u2026\u201d\nDeadpool kicks at a pebble that\u2019s in their path and sinks momentarily into thought. He hums. \u201cSo, like, how good are you at video games? Because I\u2019m stuck on this one level of Mario 64-\u201c\nPeter laughs and nudges him with an elbow. \u201cI\u2019m serious!\u201d\n\u201cSo am I!\u201d Deadpool insists, nudging him right back. \u201cI figure, hey, you\u2019re dextrous, you\u2019ve got great reflexes, probably have really good hand-eye coordination\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSadly, being bitten by a radioactive spider didn\u2019t make me magically good at video games. I mean, I\u2019m alright, but my aunt still kicks my butt at Wii bowling.\u201d\n\u201cI bet you\u2019re a huge nerd in real life,\u201d Deadpool declares, seemingly out of nowhere, snickering. \u201cAren\u2019t you? In the suit, you\u2019re this super suave, super smooth hero with the ass of a god, but out of the suit- well, I assume you still have an ass that needs worshipping, unless that suit\u2019s padded- please tell me it\u2019s not padded-\u201c\n\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d Peter glowers, shielding his ass from Deadpool\u2019s wandering eyes with his hands. He\u2019s often grateful for the mask, especially in times like these when he needs to hide a blush. It\u2019s been a while since he\u2019s had anyone flirt so blatantly. Since Gwen, his love life has been a series of sad first dates and not much else.\n\u201cHey, you said I was allowed to ogle,\u201d Deadpool pouts.\nThe remark surprises a laugh out of him. \u201cI didn\u2019t say that,\u201d he reminds. \u201cI just meant I\u2019m not jailbait-\u201c\n\u201cAnd thank god for that,\u201d Deadpool cuts in. Then he says, all in one breath, \u201cThen I\u2019d have to feel real bad about the dreams I\u2019ve been having. Oops, did I say that out loud? Ignore that. Dreams, what dreams? No one is having any dreams.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know whether to be offended or flattered,\u201d Peter muses.\n\u201cBoth?\u201d Deadpool suggests.\n\u201cBoth,\u201d Peter decides. They reach an intersection and, for the first time, Peter realizes he doesn\u2019t actually know where they\u2019re going. He isn\u2019t sure Deadpool even knows.\nHe also realizes he\u2019s not in a hurry to leave, which is troubling.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Deadpool says, scuffing the toe of his boot along the ground. \u201cDo you wanna maybe grab a bite to eat? I know this great place not far from here, best chimichangas I\u2019ve ever fucking eaten.\u201d He jerks a thumb over his shoulder, presumably toward said restaurant. \nPeter knows it\u2019s getting late and he definitely has housework that needs doing, not to mention the studying and sleeping he needs to catch up on, and it goes without saying that Spider-Man shouldn\u2019t be seen in the company of Deadpool too often, but his mouth runs away from him and he\u2019s agreeing before he really means to.\nHe finds he\u2019s not that sad about it. It\u2019s worth it for the ridiculous little happy dance Deadpool does. Peter is pretty sure he\u2019s smiled more with Deadpool in the last couple of days than in the last couple of years combined.\nThe mercenary slings an arm around him and directs him down the sidewalk. If Peter leans into him just a little instead of pulling away, well, no one needs to know. No rule says he can\u2019t be nice to Deadpool, right? \n\u201cYou\u2019ll love it,\u201d Deadpool promises, fingers curled over Peter\u2019s shoulder.\nPeter is supposed to be writing a paper.\nHe\u2019d started off in his apartment but, aside from a couple of brief outings as Spider-Man, he\u2019d been cooped up there all weekend. A change of scenery had been in order, which is why he\u2019d relocated to the coffee shop right down the road. It was Monday, mid-morning, so the place wasn\u2019t too crowded and it had just enough background noise to put Peter at ease but not drown out his thoughts. He\u2019d started off strong, with caffeine in his system and a single-minded determinedness to finish this god-forsaken paper.\nThen Deadpool had walked in about thirty minutes later and his focus was immediately waylaid.\nThe mercenary was dressed in a jacket that was zipped nearly to his chin, hood pulled up to cover his head, but underneath he was wearing his full costume. He was hard to miss. At first, Peter wasn\u2019t the only one staring. Everyone had turned to watch as Deadpool approached the counter, ordered his drink from an only slightly terrified looking barista, fumbled in one of his many pouches for the right change, and then took a seat at a corner table, facing the door.\nFacing Peter, actually, though Peter felt sure that was a coincidence. Eventually, everyone silently and mutually decided to ignore his presence and went back to their business. Everyone except for Peter, who couldn\u2019t help glancing over every two seconds, wondering why Deadpool had somehow wound up at this this coffee shop, and also wondering, for that matter, why Deadpool was even still in New York at all. He was notorious for never staying in one place longer than it took to complete a mission there.\nCome to think of it, Peter had no idea why Deadpool had come to New York in the first place. He should probably find out before Deadpool could cause the kind of trouble he was infamous for. It hadn\u2019t come up the last time they\u2019d seen each other as they\u2019d been too busy stuffing their faces with chimichangas. Well, Peter had, anyway. Deadpool had talked a lot- a lot- and pointedly avoided eating so long as there was a chance Peter might see his face.\nNow, every so often, from the corner of his eye, Peter catches Deadpool taking a sip of his coffee, mask pushed up to his nose. It\u2019s impossible to tell anything about his features from this distance but that doesn\u2019t stop Peter from trying. His curiosity has always been a force to be reckoned with and the harder Deadpool tries to hide, the more curious Peter becomes.\n\u201cDo I have something on my face, kid?\u201d\nPeter jumps. Actually, physically jumps, which is embarrassing. Deadpool is suddenly looming over him. Peter hadn\u2019t seen him get up from his seat. He\u2019s very tall and very broad-shouldered. That\u2019s easy to forget when Peter is also in costume and not playing the part of a defenseless nerd.\n\u201cUh, no,\u201d he stammers, hoping and praying Deadpool won\u2019t somehow recognize him. \u201cI was just-\u201c\n\u201cStaring,\u201d Deadpool says with obviously fake cheer. He pulls out a chair and sinks down into it in one smooth movement. He leans forward, deliberately putting himself in Peter\u2019s personal space and- ah, yes, there\u2019s that gunpowder smell that always seems to accompany him. \u201cDo we have a problem?\u201d\nHe\u2019s never sounded like this when he\u2019s talking to Spider-Man. Borderline dangerous. \u201cNo- not at all,\u201d Peter says carefully, refusing to be daunted. He closes his laptop. \u201cI was just\u2026 admiring your costume.\u201d\nThe flattery works like a charm. In an instant, the threatening aura is gone. Deadpool leans back, spreads his hands. \u201cOh, this old thing?\u201d he teases. \u201cThanks, pal. Made it myself.\u201d\nPeter nods. \u201cYeah, \u2018s nice, but if you were going for incognito\u2026\u201d\nDeadpool leans forward again, this time to prop his elbows on the table. People around them are starting to stare once more, maybe wondering why the masked merc has taken an interest in the skinny dweeb. Better Peter Parker be seen with him than Spider-Man, though. At least their picture is less likely to be published on a front page this way.\n\u201cIncognito?\u201d Deadpool says. \u201cNo, see, I don\u2019t get to be incognito. Ever. In costume, out of costume- people stare. Or, depending on how well they know me, they run screaming. Or, if they have good taste, they start swooning and dropping their panties. But you see the problem.\u201d\n\u201cYou draw attention?\u201d Peter ventures, attempting to hide his smile and doing a poor job of it. The smile only seems to encourage Deadpool, who nods happily.\n\u201cRight. Too much attention. Sometimes a guy just wants to grab a coffee and not be gawked at, you know?\u201d\nPeter does know. At least, he can imagine. He\u2019s glad he\u2019s lucky enough to be able to preserve his secret identity. He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019d do if we were constantly being hounded like Tony Stark or Steve Rogers- or, he supposes, Deadpool. \u201cSorry if I\u2026 gawked\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou,\u201d Deadpool says, hooking his foot around the leg of Peter\u2019s chair and pulling it closer. Metal scrapes against hardwood. \u201cHave permission.\u201d He waggles his eyebrows. Somehow Peter just knows that\u2019s what he\u2019s doing, even though his mask barely moves. \u201cYou\u2019re cute, kid. Real cute. Anyone ever tell you that?\u201d\n\u201cNot anyone wearing a mask,\u201d Peter replies honestly. There\u2019s a blush creeping over his cheeks, he can feel it. It\u2019s silly. It\u2019s just Deadpool, the same guy who\u2019s been hitting on him since they met. The only difference now is that he\u2019s talking to Peter, not Spider-Man. Maybe that matters.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Deadpool asks. His ankle is pressed against Peter\u2019s under the table. Does he know? Is he doing it on purpose? Peter doesn\u2019t pull away, lest he draws attention to it. \u201cTell me yours, I\u2019ll tell you mine.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 Peter. Peter Parker.\u201d There's no sense in lying, or maybe Peter just doesn\u2019t want to.\n\u201cWade Wilson,\u201d Deadpool says. Then, he claps. \u201cYay, alliteration buddies! I think this means we\u2019re soulmates.\u201d\nPeter already knew Deadpool\u2019s name, of course, he\u2019s just never been given permission to use it. Does this count? Would it be weird for Spider-Man to start calling him Wade?\nPeter shakes his head, mostly at himself. \u201cKinda getting ahead of yourself there, pal,\u201d he says, about both of them.\n\u201cYou\u2019re right. My heart belongs to someone else, anyway. Doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t treat a cute guy to coffee though, eh?\u201d Deadpool abruptly stands. Amidst protests from Peter, he produces a few crumpled bills and sets them on the table. \u201cNice meeting you, Petey. Don\u2019t worry about the money. I\u2019m filthy fucking rich.\u201d\nPeter blinks up at him. Clearly, his protests are going to go ignored, then. \u201cUm, nice to meet you too, Wade.\u201d\nWade salutes him on his way out the door, cocky swagger to his hips.\nPeter stares at the money for several minutes after he leaves. Deadpool is a whirlwind. Peter finds it hard to keep up, but he\u2019s having a lot of fun trying.\nHe winds up leaving all the money Wade gave him in the tip jar. It would feel wrong to spend it himself.\n-\n\u201cOh, honey, what happened to your face?\u201d\nPeter shrugs and attempts to wiggle his way out of Aunt May\u2019s hands but she holds him tight, turning his head this way and that, probably looking for other blemishes. \u201cNothing, nothing. Just- tripped the other day. No big deal.\u201d\nTruth be told, he\u2019d been in a little scrap as Spider-Man just this morning. Now, he\u2019s cursing himself for forgetting to throw a little concealer on the newly formed bruise adorning his jaw. He\u2019d been in a hurry, though. His lunches with Aunt May are something he tries never to be late for. She\u2019s big on punctuality.\n\u201cYou? Trip? Peter, I don\u2019t believe that for a second. You\u2019re as graceful as a ballerina, child.\u201d\n\u201cNormally, sure,\u201d Peter says, sticking to his lie. He finally manages to shake off her hold on him and ducks past her into the kitchen. \u201cI brought cookies. For dessert.\u201d He holds up the box. As far as subject changes go, it\u2019s pretty thin. Aunt May gives him a look that says she isn\u2019t buying it for a second and, bless her, lets it pass. She takes the box from him with a smile. \u201cI was gonna get flowers, too,\u201d he continues. \u201cBut then I, um. Forgot. Next time, though.\u201d\n\u201cNext time,\u201d she agrees, mirth dancing in her eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s the Peter I know and love. So forgetful. I can forgive you, though. I know you\u2019re busy. Studying hard, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cYes, Aunt May,\u201d he assures her, rolling his eyes affectionately. \u201cNothing has changed since last week when I was here. Still in school, still living in the same apartment, still taking pictures for the Bugle, still single.\u201d\nShe swats him lightly on the arm. \u201cYou\u2019ve ruined it, Peter! What on earth are we going to make small talk about now?\u201d\nDespite her teasing, they find no shortage of things to talk about throughout lunch. They keep it light, each avoiding touchy subjects like Uncle Ben or Gwen or anything to do with money, but Peter knows Aunt May likes to save anything that might be deemed controversial for after the meal and today is no different. Just as Peter is finishing the last bite of his sandwich she says, gently, \u201cSo, still single, hm?\u201d\nPeter sighs, bracing himself for whatever she might say next. Usually, it\u2019s a diatribe on how he shouldn\u2019t force himself to be alone forever for Gwen\u2019s sake. Not that he\u2019s doing any such thing. He loves Gwen and probably always will but it\u2019s not about that. It\u2019s about not making the same mistake twice. As long as he\u2019s Spider-Man, having a serious relationship seems pretty out of the question. \u201cYep. Still single.\u201d\nAunt May places her hand atop his where it rests on the table. \u201cYou would tell me, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d she asks, brow furrowed. \u201cIf you met someone?\u201d\nPeter gets an unbidden image of Deadpool, sitting beside him on a rooftop, haloed by the setting sun. He\u2019s not sure why. He shakes his head to clear the image. \u201cOf course, Aunt May. Anyone I met would have to pass the May test.\u201d He smiles. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like them, they aren\u2019t relationship material, right?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got that right,\u201d she chuckles, reaching out to pinch his cheek. \u201cNo one is really good enough for my Peter but they\u2019ve got to at least come close.\u201d\nPeter thinks she\u2019ll let it drop after that but instead her expression again turns dour. \u201cIt\u2019s just- I wonder what you do, Peter. It can\u2019t all be studying and work, can it? Do you just stay cooped up in your apartment? Do you have friends? I never hear about any friends.\u201d\nPeter does, in fact, have friends. He used to have more but it turned out most of those were actually Harry\u2019s friends and after he jumped off into the deep end and went all green goblin they just sort of\u2026 vanished. One by one. Now he\u2019s left with a couple of friends from work and MJ, who still keeps in touch even after their brief, failed try at a relationship. It\u2019s enough. Peter doesn\u2019t long for companionship- he isn\u2019t lonely, but he doesn\u2019t know how to make Aunt May understand that.\nHe pats her hand. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about me,\u201d he tries to assure her. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Everything is fine. And I\u2019m happy being single.\u201d\nShe hums, looking doubtful. \u201cWell, as long as you\u2019re happy.\u201d\nHe is. Mostly.\nHe thinks again of Deadpool. Of Wade. He wonders idly what the mercenary might be doing right now, then remembers it\u2019s probably something Not Good and frowns down at his empty plate. So Deadpool makes him laugh. He\u2019s still Deadpool and therefore not someone Peter should consider a friend. Definitely not someone Peter should be eager to see again.\nAnd yet.\n-\nPeter hears Deadpool before he sees him. He\u2019s on patrol- nearing the end of it, actually, and is just about to swing his way home- when a shout catches his attention and he changes direction, heading towards it and bracing himself for trouble.\nHe arrives on the scene just in time to see Deadpool pull a gun and shoot a fleeing man in the leg, sending him sprawling. Deadpool jogs over to him, retrieves something from the downed man, and jogs back to a woman cowering in the shadows. She takes whatever is it he offers to her, thanks him, and scrambles out of the alley, back to the safety of the public street. She walks quickly, with her head down. Deadpool turns his attention back to the wounded man, starts to advance on him with purpose. His fists are clenched by his sides.\nPeter drops down gracefully in front of Deadpool, halting his progress. Deadpool doesn\u2019t seem surprised to see him but he does seem pleased. His stance instantly loosens. \u201cOh, hey, Spidey! Don\u2019t mind me, just helping out.\u201d He takes another step forward.\nPeter places a palm flat against his chest, stopping him once more. \u201cWe need to call that man an ambulance,\u201d he says, hopefully in a tone that brooks no argument. \u201cAnd then you can explain to me why you shot him.\u201d\nPeter isn\u2019t sure why, but that seems to surprise Deadpool. \u201cAh,\u201d he says. Then, simply, \u201cAlright.\u201d\nDeadpool does as instructed. He pulls a phone out of one of his pouches, dials 911, explains to them that \u201csome douchebag\u201d has been hurt and they better get there pronto. Peter approaches the man just long enough to verify that he is, in fact, still alive, and not likely to bleed out anytime soon, even if he can\u2019t currently walk. Peter would like to believe that\u2019s not an accident. He\u2019d like to believe Deadpool chose his shot with care and was deliberately non-lethal. He tries not to think too hard about why that\u2019s so important to him.\n\u201cThere, done,\u201d Deadpool announces, snapping the phone closed. \u201cNow for the second thing-\u201c\n\u201cWait. Let\u2019s get out of here before that ambulance gets here.\u201d Peter steps close to the mercenary, whose first instinct is to recoil when Peter places his arm around him, then he seems to understand and settles into the hold, even laughs. \u201cHold on,\u201d Peter instructs.\nDeadpool does just that while Peter slings them up to the nearest roof. As soon as his feet are back on solid ground he releases Peter, only to latch back on a moment later, hands wrapped around Peter\u2019s forearms as if to keep him from getting too far away. He breathes, excited, \u201cThat was amazing, holy shit. You\u2019re so strong, Spidey. I want web-shooters!\u201d\nDeadpool\u2019s excitement is infectious but Peter\u2019s smile is quick to fade. \u201cI need to know why you shot him,\u201d he reminds, voice level. \u201cWere you trying to kill him?\u201d\nDeadpool doesn\u2019t seem in any hurry to let go of him. In fact, his hold tightens. \u201cWhat? No, no- I just had to stop him. I caught him hitting that girl. He tried to take her purse. I was- I was doing a good thing. He deserved more than that, though. He deserved a beating of his own. Fucking scumbag. She was pregnant, you know? Who robs a pregnant lady? That\u2019s some seriously bad karma-\u201c\n\u201cWade,\u201d Peter interrupts. He tries to sort through his mixed feelings of relief and apprehension. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 glad. That you helped her. And that you didn\u2019t kill him.\u201d\nDeadpool nods, once. There\u2019s a pause. Then he says, slowly, \u201cYou\u2019ve never called me that before.\u201d\nPeter can feel the tips of his ears burning as he realizes his mistake. \u201cUh\u2026 Sorry. I didn\u2019t mean-\u201c\n\u201cNo,\u201d Deadpool says. He\u2019s standing very close, radiating warmth. Peter has to tilt his head up to look him in the eye. \u201cIt\u2019s- it\u2019s fine. It\u2019s nice. I like it. I wondered if you knew my name. I figure the Avengers have a file or two on me, eh?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not an Avenger,\u201d Peter gently reminds. \u201cIf they have a file, I\u2019ve never seen it.\u201d\nFor a moment neither of them speaks. There aren\u2019t many quiet moments with Deadpool, which is why this one is so striking. Peter has just enough time to realize there are butterflies in his stomach before Deadpool- Wade- steps away, releasing him.\n\u201cAnd, um, thanks,\u201d Wade says, palming at the back of his neck. He studies the ground. \u201cFor not just, you know. Showing up and assuming I was in the wrong. Most people would\u2019ve. Hell, most people do.\u201d\nPeter swallows. \u201cI, um. I try to give everyone a fair shake. You\u2019ve been here a couple of weeks now and you haven\u2019t caused any trouble, so.\u201d He shrugs.\n\u201cRight.\u201d Wade perks up. \u201cI kinda like it here, you know? New York isn\u2019t so bad.\u201d\n\u201cI like it quite a bit myself,\u201d Peter agrees. God is he glad he wears a mask. He\u2019s pretty sure his face is doing some dopey fond thing- and not in regards to his city. This is bad. He sends up a silent prayer that none of the Avengers- or, for that matter, the X-Men- ever get wind of this.\n\u201cSo you don\u2019t mind if I hang around a bit?\u201d Wade asks. Before Peter can even open his mouth, Wade drops dramatically to his knees, hands clasped in front of him. \u201cPlease, please, please? I promise I\u2019ll be good! I don\u2019t wanna go back- too many bad memories. And all the other heroes hate me, it\u2019s terrible. Don\u2019t know a good thing when they see it. You\u2019re the only one with any sense, Spidey.\u201d\nBy the end of his rant, Peter\u2019s shoulders are shaking with laughter. \u201cYou\u2019re ridiculous,\u201d he decides. \u201cBut yeah, you can stay. If you promise to be good. That means no killing.\u201d\nWade pouts. \u201cEven if they really deserve it?\u201d\n\u201cEven if you think they really deserve it, yes.\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d Wade agrees with a sigh, relenting surprisingly easily.\n\u201cBesides,\u201d Peter adds, offering him a hand up. \u201cI still owe you that favor.\u201d\n\u201cSo you do,\u201d Wade agrees, sounding mischievous. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a hero in debt to me before. I can\u2019t waste this golden opportunity.\u201d\nPeter holds up a finger. \u201cNothing-\u201c\n\u201cMorally ambiguous,\u201d Wade finishes for him, waving a dismissive hand. \u201cYeah, yeah. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll put you to good use.\u201d\nPause. \u201cSounds dirty,\u201d Peter says.\nWade chuckles. He drapes an arm over Peter\u2019s shoulders and whispers into his ear, \u201cOnly if you want it to be.\u201d\nPeter shrugs him off, blushing again. Damn it. \u201cMind out of the gutter,\u201d he scolds.\n\u201cHey, you\u2019re the one who went there first,\u201d Wade points out.\nPeter shakes his head but he can\u2019t argue the point.\nThey wind up walking back to Wade\u2019s apartment together. Wade blows him a kiss farewell and decrees this the \u201cstart of a beautiful friendship\u201d.\nPeter is just worried he\u2019ll come to regret his decision.\n\u201cLookin\u2019 good, Spidey. And by \u2018good\u2019 I actually mean terrible. And by \u2018terrible\u2019 I mean damn fine but a little scorched around the edges. Get into a fight with a toaster?\u201d\nPeter picks grumpily at a blackened portion of his suit. \u201cElectro,\u201d he says, which is enough explanation.\nWade hops down from his perch atop the nearest dumpster. He looks past Peter, finally seems to notice the scores of police cars and general destruction and mayhem that Spider-Man\u2019s fight with Electro left behind. How he could\u2019ve possibly been oblivious to it before is a mystery to Peter. \u201cShit, I missed it? Would\u2019ve been the perfect opportunity for a team-up!\u201d\n\u201cI handled it,\u201d Peter says. He\u2019s sore and tired and mostly he just wants to go home and collapse into bed but he can\u2019t because he promised he\u2019d have dinner with MJ and he can\u2019t cancel on her again. That would be the third time in a row and at that point, it just becomes suspicious, not to mention super rude. His Aunt taught him better than that.\n\u201cAw,\u201d Wade coos. \u201cIs someone a grumpy little spider today?\u201d He pokes Peter\u2019s exposed ribcage. This suit has enough holes in it that there probably won\u2019t be any fixing it, even with Peter\u2019s quite frankly amazing sewing skills. \u201cDoes someone need a nap? Oooh, or a hug?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not grumpy,\u201d Peter says, aware that he sounds the exact opposite. He swats at Wade\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019m just- I need to get out of here before the cops decide they want a word.\u201d\n\u201cRight. I getcha. My place isn\u2019t far, you know. You could crash there for a while if you wanted. As long as you promise not to snoop. I know it\u2019s no five-star hotel but the couch is pretty comfy and I\u2019ve got air fresheners.\u201d\n\u201cDo you?\u201d Peter wonders, trying to remember what the place had smelled like. Not air fresheners, that\u2019s for sure. At the time it had mostly smelled like tacos if he recalls correctly.\n\u201cThey\u2019re new,\u201d Wade says, doing jazz hands.\nThe offer is actually pretty tempting. Not only does he know Wade\u2019s place is pretty cozy but he\u2019s also aware of the fact that Wade\u2019s presence would, undoubtedly, cheer him up. When the man went from being a mysterious nuisance to a source of- of happiness, Peter isn\u2019t sure. It\u2019s annoying and unexpected and if MJ ever found out Peter was thinking about bailing on her so he could spend time with a sword-wielding maniac, she\u2019d kill him.\nHe sighs, pinches the bridge of his nose between two fingers. \u201cI- I can\u2019t. The suit. I wanna change. And I\u2019ve got\u2026 plans.\u201d\n\u201cPlans? What kinda plans? What does Spider-Man do with his free time, hm?\u201d Wade\u2019s shoulders slump as something occurs to him. \u201cIs it a date? I bet it\u2019s a date.\u201d\nPeter laughs. It\u2019s humorless. \u201cDefinitely not a date. Haven\u2019t been on one those in a while.\u201d\nWade perks up. He shoots a finger gun at Peter, complete with little pew pew noises. \u201cWe could fix that any time, pal.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, you know someone?\u201d Peter deadpans.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t see it,\u201d Wade tells him seriously. \u201cBut I am rolling my eyes so hard right now.\u201d\nPeter has to laugh at that- genuinely, this time. \u201cIt\u2019s just a friend,\u201d he assures him, not sure why he\u2019s even bothering. \u201cA friend date, I guess. One that I am going to be seriously late for if I don\u2019t leave right now.\u201d\nWade holds up his hands. \u201cDon\u2019t let me keep you, princess. You know I love watching you walk away.\u201d\n\u201cToo bad I won\u2019t be walking,\u201d Peter quips.\nHe hears Wade wolf whistle as he slings himself toward the nearest rooftop. The grin on his face lingers far longer than it has any right to.\n-\nPeter is underdressed. He knows he\u2019s underdressed as soon as he steps out of the cab. Leave it to MJ to pick somewhere exceedingly fancy for dinner- exceedingly fancy and probably exceedingly expensive, too, as if either of them can really afford it. At least it's just MJ, Peter tells himself. She won\u2019t care if he\u2019s not wearing a tie and she\u2019ll understand when he orders the cheapest thing on the menu.\nOf course, as soon as he has the thought, Peter rounds the corner and spots MJ at a central table. MJ and a girl Peter\u2019s never met before.\nShe\u2019s beautiful, with smooth, dark skin, big, expressive eyes, and soft, black hair that falls in loose curls over her shoulders. She\u2019s the kind of pretty that\u2019s intimidating. Peter used to think that about MJ, too, though, and now the two of them are good friends.\nIt\u2019s with some trepidation that Peter approaches the table. MJ\u2019s eyes light up as soon as she sees him. \u201cPeter!\u201d she says happily, standing to greet him. She wraps him in a loose hug that he barely has time to return before she whirls around and gestures at her friend. \u201cPeter, this is Marisol. Marisol, Peter. I hope it\u2019s okay that I asked her to join us, Pete. This is her favorite restaurant, so I thought, why not-\u201c\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Peter assures her, aware that he sounds brusque but unable to help it. Of all the days for MJ to spring this on him, she couldn\u2019t have picked a worse one. He\u2019s exhausted from his fight with Electro and the last thing he wants to do is try to impress a girl. \u201cNice to meet you, Marisol,\u201d he says. He turns to MJ. \u201cA word?\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d MJ says, confusion evident. \u201cBe right back!\u201d she calls to Marisol over her shoulder as Peter leads her away from the table. Marisol, for her part, gives a little wave, brow furrowed.\nUnfortunately, there\u2019s nowhere to go that could be considered private, so Peter settles for being out of earshot. He puts his back to Marisol so the poor girl can\u2019t see his borderline murderous expression. \u201cI see what you\u2019re doing here,\u201d he tells MJ, voice low. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t appreciate it.\u201d\nMJ tries to feign innocence. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean, Pete. I just thought-\u201c\n\u201cYou just thought, hey, dinner with Peter, perfect opportunity to set him up with someone. And, let me guess, you were going to find some convenient excuse to duck out after the appetizers, leaving us alone? And then we would what, magically fall in love?\u201d\nMJ is scowling now, offended. \u201cI thought it might be nice for you to meet someone new. That\u2019s all.\u201d\nA metaphorical lightbulb flickers to life above Peter\u2019s head. He points accusingly. \u201cYou\u2019ve been talking to Aunt May, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\nFor a second it looks like MJ might try to deny it. In the end, she decides to go with the truth. \u201cYes,\u201d she admits, tilting her chin up like she\u2019s daring Peter to challenge her. \u201cAnd she\u2019s right. You need to put yourself out there! Even if it doesn\u2019t work out romantically, you could always make some new friends.\u201d\nPeter groans, frustrated. \u201cI don\u2019t need new friends! And I don\u2019t need you and Aunt May scheming behind my back!\u201d\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t be a child, Peter. We aren\u2019t scheming. Is it really going to hurt anything for you to sit down and have dinner with a pretty girl? No. Now put on your big boy pants and let\u2019s go back to the table before she decides she\u2019s fed up and leaves. Okay?\u201d\nPeter thinks about arguing some more. He even thinks about storming out but none of this is Marisol\u2019s fault and she\u2019s the only one whose feelings would get hurt if he left without an explanation.\n\u201cYou do look pretty tired, Pete,\u201d MJ notes. Concern colors her voice. \u201cHave you been sleeping alright?\u201d\nPeter touches his own face. Great, something else to be self-conscious about.\nHe doesn\u2019t dignify MJ with an answer. Instead, he turns on his heel and, fake smile plastered firmly in place, goes back to the table. MJ follows behind at a leisurely pace, giving Peter plenty of time to arrive before her and make their apologies.\nMarisol takes it all in stride. She really is a lovely girl. Not just in looks but in manner. She\u2019s graceful and elegant and smart and she laughs at Peter\u2019s dumb jokes- and even supplies some of her own. So why, then, is Peter having to fake the cheer on his face? Why can\u2019t he invest himself in the conversation? Why doesn\u2019t he care, at the end of it all, whether or not she\u2019s impressed with him?\n\u201cNo chemistry,\u201d he tells MJ after dinner, as the two of them wait for their cabs. \u201cShe\u2019s beautiful, obviously, but. There was nothing there.\u201d\n\u201cSeems like she would disagree. She gave you her number, Peter.\u201d\nPeter absently fingers the scrap of paper in his pocket. He shrugs. There\u2019s a pretty good chance he\u2019ll never use it.\nMJ huffs, annoyed. \u201cIt\u2019s never going to work if you don\u2019t at least try, you know.\u201d\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have to try. I never had to try with Gwen. Or Harry. I never have to try with you. It just\u2026 comes naturally. Because there\u2019s chemistry. Platonic or otherwise.\u201d\nMJ rolls her eyes hard enough that Peter is afraid she might dislodge them. \u201cWhen are you going to stop comparing everyone to Gwen? No one else is Gwen. No one is ever going to measure up. But you can find something new, something different. Something just as good.\u201d She thumps him on the shoulder. \u201cBut not if you keep dismissing everyone you meet as not good enough the second you lay eyes on them!\u201d\nPeter rubs at his shoulder, wincing. MJ packs quite the punch despite looking so unassuming. \u201cJust please don\u2019t set me up with anyone else without warning me first? Okay? Can we at least agree that\u2019s a little underhanded?\u201d\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d MJ grumbles. \u201cAnyone else would\u2019ve been thrilled to walk in and see a girl like that sitting there.\u201d\nPeter really doesn\u2019t want to acknowledge the truth of that.\n-\nPeter has a pretty well-kept routine, barring any Spider-Man issues that crop up. On Friday\u2019s, he goes grocery shopping, which is exactly what he\u2019s doing when Wade decides to make another appearance.\nWade is in civvies this time, aside from his usual mask and gloves which remain firmly in place. Peter is starting to think they might be glued on. He\u2019d test the theory if he didn\u2019t think Wade would get royally pissed. There\u2019s also the whole invasion of privacy thing but damn if Peter isn\u2019t dying to know what the mercenary finds so off-putting about his own face. It can\u2019t be all that bad. And, even if it is that bad and Wade is lacking skin or covered in festering boils or actually a leper, Peter already knows he wouldn\u2019t run screaming, like Wade seems to think. Peter isn\u2019t charmed by him because of what he does or doesn\u2019t look like.\nActually, scratch that, Peter isn\u2019t charmed by him at all. That would be weird. And bad.\nHe shakes his head as if he can dislodge the thought entirely from his brain. It doesn\u2019t work, but he decides to pretend it never occurred and forces himself to refocus on his grocery list, which mostly contains microwaveable meals and various flavors of ramen noodles. Aunt May would be disappointed in him.\nPeter decides to try and grab his things and leave as quickly as possible, figuring that the less time Wade spends around him out of costume the less likely he is to recognize Peter as Spider-Man. He almost makes it out without incident, too, but then he rounds the corner of an aisle and there Wade is, helping a petite elderly lady reach things on the top shelf. Peter\u2019s first instinct is to retreat but the image of famed and deadly mercenary Deadpool helping tiny old people do things as mundane as grocery shop holds him enthralled long enough for Wade to spot him and then there\u2019s no escape.\n\u201cPetey!\u201d Deadpool shouts, pointing. He says something in hushed tones to the old woman that has her giggling behind her hand and then jogs over, excitement etched in every line of his body. \u201cRemember me?\u201d he asks, stopping a few feet in front of Peter, as if anyone normal would forget an encounter like the one they had in the coffee shop.\n\u201cOf course. Wade Wilson. Alliteration buddies.\u201d\n\u201cYou do remember! Shit, what are the odds, right? This city is crazy big but we just keep bumping into each other. Must be fate!\u201d\n\u201cI dunno,\u201d Peter hedges. \u201cIt\u2019s only happened twice\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re even cuter standing up,\u201d Wade says, talking over him. Peter can\u2019t see his eyes but he gets the distinct impression he\u2019s being given a once over. The impression is solidified when Wade adds, \u201cYou work out? You\u2019re pretty toned for a geek.\u201d\n\u201cSometimes.\u201d Peter is suddenly hyper-aware of how unkempt his hair is and how pale he is and the fact that there\u2019s a stain near the bottom of his shirt. All things he doesn\u2019t have to worry about as Spider-Man. Spider-Man never has stains. Peter shifts awkwardly on his feet. \u201cWhat are you doing here, Wade?\u201d\n\u201cAs of two seconds ago, helping Martha reach the olives.\u201d\n\u201cMartha?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Nice old lady, three grandchildren, and one on the way. Lost her husband last year. She plays bridge every Monday. Always wanted a pony. Just met her five minutes ago but it\u2019s amazing what people will tell you once you get them talking.\u201d\nPeter blinks. \u201cRight. Sure.\u201d\n\u201cBut if you were asking what I\u2019m doing here in general, well. Even heroes have to eat. And sadly I can\u2019t just eat tacos and chimichangas. I asked.\u201d\n\u201cWho the hell did you ask?\u201d Peter wonders.\nWade doesn\u2019t answer. Instead, he leans in close. He seems to be studying Peter. Then he says, voice soft, \u201cYour smile\u2026\u201d\nPeter hadn\u2019t been aware he was even smiling. Now that attention\u2019s been drawn to it, it drops. \u201cWhat about it?\u201d he asks, defensive. Bracing himself for Wade to out him to the world as Spider-Man as a worst-case scenario.\n\u201cNooo, don\u2019t stop,\u201d Wade whines. He touches the corner of Peter\u2019s mouth, very lightly. Peter stands very still. \u201cIt\u2019s- it\u2019s nice. You\u2019re really\u2026 really\u2026\u201d\nHe trails off. Peter never gets to find out what he really is because Martha, having made it five more feet down the aisle, calls Wade\u2019s name. Wade immediately straightens, touch disappearing. He shrugs apologetically. \u201cSorry, Petey. Duty calls.\u201d\nPeter wants to protest, wants to demand that Wade come back and finish that thought right this instant. What is he really? Really cute? Really entertaining? Really something? Of course, Peter doesn\u2019t say anything. He just nods his understanding, hesitates just long enough to watch Wade skip down the aisle, and then takes his leave.\nPeter just hopes he hadn\u2019t been about to say really familiar.\n-\nAs far as patrols go, this has been one of Peter\u2019s quieter nights. It\u2019s a nice night, too. The sky is clear, the moon is bright, the weather is perfect for web-slinging, but tonight Peter almost wishes there was someone in need of rescuing or some problem to solve. It would spare him having to be alone with his thoughts, which have turned traitor on him. All he can think about is his encounter with Wade earlier today. He keeps turning it over and over in his head, then wondering why he cares so much, then getting frustrated that he cares so much, and so on and so forth. It\u2019s a never-ending cycle.\nIt\u2019s almost a relief when Wade shows up in the flesh.\n\u201cWe have got to stop meeting like this. On rooftops, I mean. It\u2019s romantic and all but I have a helluva time getting up here.\u201d\nPeter doesn\u2019t startle when Wade sidles up beside him and places a hand on his shoulder. He\u2019d heard him coming, though Peter suspects that was deliberate. He doubts very seriously that Wade would fail to sneak up on him if he really wanted to.\n\u201cYou know, you\u2019re a hard spider to find. You really should have a spider signal. Like the bat signal, with the giant fucking bat projected onto the clouds. Except yours would be a spider, obviously. Genius, right? Hold on- are we allowed to talk about Batman? Rival franchises and all.\u201d\n\u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Peter admits, \u201cBut it sounds like a dumb idea.\u201d\nWade scoffs. \u201cFine. Get a pager or something then, Christ.\u201d\n\u201cPager? What is this, the nineties?\u201d\nWade tilts his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know, is it? \u2018S hard to keep track. But that\u2019s beside the point. The point is, it\u2019d be nice if I had a way to contact you.\u201d He scuffs the toe of his boot along the ground, suddenly very interested in everything that isn\u2019t Peter. \u201cIn case there\u2019s any, uh. Emergencies. And whatnot.\u201d\n\u201cIn case of whatnot,\u201d Peter parrots, watching him. \u201cRight, makes sense.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if I need to call in that favor, hm? What if I need to call in that favor all the way from Bolivia?\u201d\nPeter considers this. \u201cAre you going to Bolivia?\u201d\n\u201cWell, no,\u201d Wade admits. \u201cBut I am gonna be gone for a few days. Got a job. Can\u2019t say where, though, then I\u2019d have to kill ya. Wait. Am I allowed to say that? Is it funny when I say it, or scary? I can\u2019t see your face, help me out here.\u201d\nPeter clears his throat. There\u2019s a weird pang in his chest. He doesn\u2019t like it. \u201cDepends on whether or not you mean it, I guess,\u201d he says. It sounds kind of hollow.\n\u201cI\u2019d never kill you, Spidey.\u201d He reaches over to pinch Peter\u2019s cheek. Hard to do with the mask in the way but Wade doesn\u2019t let that deter him. \u201cYou\u2019re just too darn cute!\u201d\nPeter ignores him. \u201cSo\u2026 you\u2019re leaving? For how long?\u201d\n\u201cHowever long it takes to get the job done. Five days tops. Probably. Maybe. Why? Is there a certain hero in red and blue spandex that\u2019s gonna miss me while I\u2019m gone?\u201d\n\u201cYou wish,\u201d Peter says, but it sounds unconvincing even to him. He shouldn\u2019t care. He knows he shouldn\u2019t care. What\u2019s more, he knows Wade is probably going off to kill someone in exchange for money. Why doesn\u2019t that bother him like it used to? Maybe it\u2019s just gotten a little too easy to pretend otherwise. They don\u2019t talk about it and Wade doesn\u2019t kill in front of him, or in New York at all as far as Peter can tell. His way of following the rules.\nWade bumps their hips together. \u201cAw, shucks. I won\u2019t be gone long. Not since I just got your permission to hang around and all. I\u2019ll be back to bother you before you know it!\u201d\n\u201cThat a promise?\u201d\nMaybe Wade picks up on Peter\u2019s uncharacteristically somber tone because his own sobers up to match it. \u201cTold you, lying ain\u2019t my bag. Not sure why you\u2019d care, though. I figured you\u2019d be happy to have me out of your hair. Like the other heroes.\u201d\n\u201cLike you said, I\u2019m the only hero with any sense.\u201d It comes out quiet, nearly a whisper.\nWade chuckles, low. \u201cThat you are. I\u2019m not used to anyone worrying about me, you know. I think I like it.\u201d\n\u201cWorrying? Who\u2019s worrying? I\u2019m not worrying.\u201d Peter realizes, rather abruptly, just how close the two of them are standing. It seems prudent to put some distance between them. \u201cI\u2019ll, um. I\u2019ll find something,\u201d he says, stepping back. \u201cSome way for us to keep in touch. Just in case.\u201d\n\u201cJust in case,\u201d Wade agrees. Peter would swear he\u2019s smirking under that mask. \u201cWe\u2019ll work something out when I get back, yeah? Just don\u2019t croak on me while I\u2019m gone and we\u2019re golden.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll do my best,\u201d Peter promises, marveling at how quickly he\u2019s grown attached to someone that is so ridiculously off-limits and should be impossible to like. It\u2019s just his luck, he supposes.\nWade is gone for two weeks.\nPeter tries not to think about it. At first, it\u2019s easy. Spider-Man is kept busy. In the first five days alone he stops three attempted muggings, puts Rhino back where he belongs, foils one of Loki\u2019s many plans for world domination with the Avengers, and helps Wolverine track down Mystique who, it turns out, is holed up in a penthouse suite under an assumed name with something valuable taken from Xavier\u2019s school.\nAfter that, though, things get quiet. Then six days have gone by, and then seven, and then ten, and by the thirteenth day Peter is officially concerned.\nBy the time he decides to swing by Wade\u2019s apartment and check on things just in case, he\u2019s exhausted. Spider-Man spent the morning taking down Mysterio and the evening putting a stop to a pyromaniac with a homemade flamethrower. Peter spent all his free time in between working on a project that\u2019s due in two days and he\u2019s had three sleepless nights in a row. He\u2019s dead on his feet and he knows it, but he also knows he won\u2019t be able to rest entirely easy until he\u2019s sure that Wade is okay. He chooses not to examine too closely why exactly that might be.\nThere\u2019s a light on in Wade\u2019s window, which briefly gives him hope. Peter climbs up to the window with ease and finds it unlocked. That, too, gives him hope that Wade might be home after all, but the apartment is empty. Peter calls Wade\u2019s name- he\u2019s not there to sneak up on the man, after all, and in fact, feels like that would be a very bad idea- and gets no reply. He searches every room and finds nothing but dust, furniture, and naturally accumulated clutter.\nHe hadn\u2019t actually expected to find Wade at home but he\u2019s still somehow disappointed. He sinks down on Wade\u2019s couch with a heavy sigh and notes, idly, that the place does smell nice, kind of like fresh linen. That would presumably be thanks to the air fresheners that Wade mentioned.\n\u201cWhere are you?\u201d he murmurs to himself, squinting accusingly at Wade\u2019s TV. His own face is reflected back at him from the dark screen.\nPeter thinks about getting up. He means to get up and go home, he really does, but Wade\u2019s couch is comfortable and it\u2019s so quiet and peaceful and he\u2019s so tired\u2026\nHis nap is entirely accidental.\nIf he has dreams, he doesn\u2019t remember them.\nHe wakes sometime later to someone softly calling his name. Not his name, but Spider-Man\u2019s name. Over and over, growing more frantic with each repetition. Peter finally regains consciousness right around the time Wade is saying, \u201cPlease tell me you didn\u2019t die on my couch. I\u2019d never be able to explain that.\u201d\nPeter blinks his eyes open, becomes painfully aware of how his suit is sticking to him and how itchy his mask is, then realizes he\u2019s still on Wade\u2019s couch, head pillowed on the armrest. Wade is kneeling on the floor beside him. His hand, heavy and warm, is resting lightly on Peter\u2019s bicep. He\u2019s definitely not dead. Relief is the first thing Peter feels but hot on its heels is mortification. \nPeter groans. He places his hands over his face. He says, voice still rough with sleep, \u201cOf course you\u2019d come home the one night I just happen to fall asleep on your couch like some creepy stalker.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Wade says. \u201cI think it\u2019s cute. In fact, this is probably the best thing I\u2019ve ever come home to.\u201d\nPeter peeks out at him from between his fingers. Sometimes he really wishes he could see Wade\u2019s face, read his expression. It\u2019s selfish, that wish, especially when Peter knows he could never return the favor. \u201cYou\u2026 don\u2019t want to know why I\u2019m here?\u201d\n\u201cNah.\u201d Wade squeezes his arm once, reassuring, and lets go. \u201cI\u2019m just gonna assume it\u2019s because you were worried about me- which is stupid, by the way, even if it is flattering- or you missed me so much you\u2026 wanted to be surrounded by my shit for some reason? I didn\u2019t think these through too hard but shhh, don\u2019t tell me otherwise and ruin the fantasy, k?\u201d\nPeter\u2019s brain is still working too slowly for him to come up with a suitable retort. He opens his mouth, closes it, and opens it again. What finally comes out is, \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d He props himself up on an elbow to get a better look.\nNot only is Wade spattered with blood, but there are also holes torn in his suit. There\u2019s one in particular that catches Peter\u2019s eye, right at the curve of his neck. The skin revealed there is scarred and uneven and Peter is weirdly fascinated. He reaches out, stops just short of touching, pauses there. Wade doesn\u2019t seem to be breathing. \u201cAre\u2026 you okay?\u201d Peter ventures, taking his hand back.\nFor a second, Wade is silent and perfectly still. Then, abruptly, he holds up his own hand, which has a bloody white towel wrapped around it. \u201cI will be!\u201d he chirps, sounding far too cheerful for someone who looks to have lost as much blood as he has.\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Peter repeats, cringing on his behalf.\n\u201cJust had a little teeny tiny minor setback, no big deal. Not the first time I\u2019ve had to regrow a limb, won\u2019t be the last. But, hey, you should\u2019ve seen the other guy. I look like a fucking treat compared to him, lemme tell ya.\u201d\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t,\u201d Peter mumbles.\nWade stands. Peter starts to rise with him, either to accommodate him on the couch or to leave, like he feels he probably should. Instead, Wade lifts Peter\u2019s legs with his uninjured arm, plops himself down on the couch, and resettles Peter\u2019s legs across his lap, which reads to Peter like a clear invitation to stay. Peter, hesitant, wills himself to relax back into the cushions. He watches the way Wade\u2019s fingers curl casually around his ankle.\n\u201cYou know you were gone for two weeks?\u201d Peter presses. Wade\u2019s suit is ripped along his thigh. The skin there is scarred, too.\n\u201cWas I? Well, you know what they say. Time flies when you\u2019re yada yada- oh, wait! That\u2019s why you\u2019re here! Because I was gone so long. Okay, I can work with that. That\u2019s fine. But, you know, Spidey, you really don\u2019t have to worry about me.\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t-\u201c Peter cuts himself off with a groan. \u201cUgh, whatever. See if I ever come check on you again.\u201d\n\u201cSo you were checking on me!\u201d Wade does a victorious fist pump with his rag-wrapped hand. \u201cKnew it! Well, my eight-legged pal-\u201c\n\u201cI don\u2019t have eight legs. I very clearly don\u2019t have eight legs-\u201c\n\u201c-This should help put your mind at ease.\u201d Wade wiggles around, jostling Peter until he can get at a particular pouch. He pulls out an old flip phone, brandishes it with pride. \u201cTa-dah! It\u2019s personalized and everything!\u201d\nPeter takes it. He flips it open and closed, and finally turns it around. \u201cBy \u2018personalized\u2019 I guess you mean you put a Deadpool sticker on the back?\u201d\nWade\u2019s reply is a thumbs up. \u201cMine has a tiny Spider-Man! Genius, right? It\u2019s so we can keep in touch. In case of emergencies, like I said before. My number\u2019s already programmed in.\u201d\nPeter slides his thumb around the edge of the small screen. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 why did you- I said I\u2019d figure something out, you didn\u2019t have to do this.\u201d\n\u201cI just figured, you have a secret identity, I don\u2019t, so it\u2019d be easier for me to get us phones and shit. This way no one can trace them back to you. Thoughtful, aren\u2019t I? It\u2019s okay, you don\u2019t have to hide your swooning, I won\u2019t let it go to my head.\u201d\nPeter chuckles. \u201cSpider-Man doesn\u2019t swoon. But\u2026 thanks. Now I can just text you like a normal person instead of breaking into your apartment.\u201d\n\u201cNext time I might have to call the cops on you.\u201d He gestures. \u201cI think there\u2019s a remote somewhere by your head and I\u2019m pretty sure Star Trek reruns are on and we\u2019re missing them.\u201d\nPeter fishes around blindly with his hand until it comes into contact with the remote. He\u2019s just started flipping channels when Wade says, \u201cOh, and one more thing, Spidey. You usually sleep in your suit?\u201d\nPeter digs his heel into Wade\u2019s leg. \u201cShut up,\u201d he grumbles.\n-\n\u201cNot so fast!\u201d\nThe would-be assassin freezes, blade drawn and poised to finish off her quarry. She\u2019s dressed like a dime-store ninja, mask pulled up to obscure the lower part of her face. Her eyes watch him with no small amount of shrewdness. The scientist in her hold is so scared he looks like he might wet himself. Peter prays he at least waits until the fight is over.\n\u201cLet him go,\u201d Peter orders, not at all surprised when the woman ignores him and raises her blade once more. Peter rolls his eyes. \u201cThey never listen,\u201d he complains, mostly to himself. He fires web at her, intending to pull the blade from her hand, but she\u2019s light on her feet. She flips backward, dodging his every shot. He pauses, just for the barest of seconds, to reassess. She takes the opportunity to rush him. She moves like fluid and she\u2019s on him before he knows it. He barely has time to swing himself out of the way and even then she manages to nick his leg, cutting through the fabric of his suit with ease.\nFrom the safety of the rafters, he examines the cut. It\u2019s not too bad, long but not all that deep. He\u2019s definitely had worse before.\nShe stands below, watching him, pacing back and forth. The scientist has scrambled away but she blocks the only exit from the room.\n\u201cThat the best you got?\u201d Peter calls down to her. \u201cI\u2019ve got a friend who wields a katana better than you in his sleep.\u201d\nHer voice, when she speaks, is high but rough like sandpaper and sounds like hissing. She has an accent but it isn\u2019t one that Peter can place. \u201cDoes he also poison his blades?\u201d she asks, faux-sweet.\nPeter looks back down at the cut. \u201c\u2026 You\u2019re bluffing.\u201d\nShe brandishes the sword. The edge is now adorned with his blood. \u201cOne hit. That\u2019s all I ever need, little hero.\u201d\nHe fires more web at her, which she dodges easily, but he uses her distraction as an opportunity to swing himself at her, intending to take her off her feet. She dodges that, too, and Peter starts to feel the effects of the poison right around the time he hits the ground. He rolls into standing, poised to counter any incoming blows, but she\u2019s still just watching him, mirth dancing in her eyes. \n\u201cOh, no,\u201d he mutters as his vision begins to go double. This is entirely too much like the time he was recently drugged, he thinks. His limbs already feel sluggish and heavy and his knees weak. This isn\u2019t a feeling he wants to get used to.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d says the woman. \u201cYou were not part of the contract. In such a small dose my poison probably won\u2019t kill you. It will just incapacitate you long enough for me to finish the job I was sent here to do.\u201d\nPeter stumbles towards her, not sure what he intends to do but just knowing he has to do something.\nA shot rings out, taking the woman in the shoulder and narrowly missing Peter himself. She cries out in pain and falls to one knee, sword abandoned. She clasps a hand over her new wound and looks around, confused and angry, but Peter already knows who it is even before Wade announces himself.\n\u201cAh, there you are,\u201d Wade says casually, sidling up to Peter. He twirls the gun around his finger. \u201cMy little damsel in distress.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not a- never mind.\u201d He decides not to question how Wade knew where he would be or exactly the right moment to show up. Instead, he advances on the woman, even though he feels like his legs might give out from beneath him at any second. \u201cWho sent you?\u201d he demands to know. \u201cWhy kill this scientist?\u201d\nShe grits her teeth and says nothing.\n\u201cUh, honey,\u201d Wade says, tapping him on the shoulder. \u201cThe cops are on their way. Shouldn\u2019t we, you know, vamoose?\u201d He levels the gun at the woman, finger on the trigger. \u201cI can take care of this problem real quick.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t kill her,\u201d Peter snaps. The cut on his leg is burning now. It feels like it\u2019s on fire.\n\u201cFine,\u201d Wade snaps back. \u201cI\u2019ll just make sure she can\u2019t get up and follow us.\u201d He fires before Peter can protest again, hitting the woman in the knee and knocking her on her ass. She screams, a sound of rage and hurt, and writhes uselessly on the floor.\n\u201cNow come on- whoa there, buddy.\u201d Wade catches Peter as he sways nearly off his feet. \u201cYou\u2019re a little unsteady. What happened? Wait, don\u2019t tell me she cut you. I know this chick. Made a name for herself in the merc business by playing dirty.\u201d\n\u201cI- yeah. Yeah, she did. So get me out of here before I embarrass myself.\u201d\n\u201cRoger that.\u201d\nPeter refuses to be carried. He makes it most of the way outside by himself and then has to clutch shamefully at Wade\u2019s arm to make it the rest of the way. They\u2019re already a block gone by the time the cops show up, sirens announcing their presence behind them. It\u2019s slow going and with every step, Peter feels the effects of the poison more and more.\n\u201cSince it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re in any shape to do any web-slinging,\u201d Wade says, taking them down the next side street, putting them out of the eye line of any cops. \u201cWe\u2019ll call a cab.\u201d\n\u201cA cab? Dressed like this?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I do it all the time. They\u2019ll just think we\u2019re cosplayers or something.\u201d\n\u201cCoswhats?\u201d\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. Point is, it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\u201cYou have real weapons strapped to you.\u201d\nWade shrugs. \u201cNew York cabbies,\u201d he says like that makes his point.\nTrue to his word, they have no more trouble than usual getting a cab. The cab driver doesn\u2019t so much as look at them sideways when they climb in. \nPeter rests his head against the window. The cool glass feels nice. It would feel nicer if he could remove his mask but he\u2019ll take what he can get. \u201cI guess I owe you double, now,\u201d Peter says. Wade doesn\u2019t reply. \u201cYou said you knew her? That woman?\u201d\n\u201cOh, not well. But we merc\u2019s tend to keep tabs on each other. I mean, she is my competition, more or less. Hey, you\u2019re not gonna die, are you? Should we be going to a hospital? Poisons are a little outside my purview.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no hospital. Don\u2019t trust anyone there.\u201d He closes his eyes against a wave of dizziness. \u201cSo, she was paid to kill him and probably didn\u2019t even know why.\u201d He hums, turning it over in his head. \u201cHe was probably crooked. Got on the wrong side of the wrong people. I don\u2019t trust anyone at Oscorp anymore.\u201d\n\u201cSo why save him?\u201d\n\u201cWhatever he did, he didn\u2019t deserve to die for it.\u201d\nWade is quiet for a moment. Then, \u201cAnd her? She\u2019s a paid killer. She\u2019ll survive this and go right back to taking contracts.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019ll survive this and go through the system.\u201d Peter sighs. \u201cPeople can change, Wade. Even people like her.\u201d\nWade seems to have no retort for that. He lets it drop and the rest of the cab ride is spent in silence. Peter doesn\u2019t even realize where they\u2019re going until they arrive outside Wade\u2019s apartment building. Of course, Wade would bring him here. Where else could they go?\nThey stumble up the stairs and in through the doorway, Peter limping and dizzy and Wade doing his best to support him without actually carrying him. Peter doesn\u2019t know where he\u2019s trying to go or what he\u2019s trying to do, it just becomes abundantly clear all at once that he needs to sit down, right now, or else topple over.\nHe tries to convey this to Wade by gesturing without actually letting go of him. He tugs, pulling Wade toward the couch while Wade tries to hold him steady. They fall, of course, right over the back of the couch and into a heap on the other side, half on the cushions and half on the floor. They\u2019re still holding onto each other. Wade is laughing breathlessly.\n\u201cCome- Spidey, come here. Up and at \u2018em,\u201d he says, pulling Peter all the way onto the couch. Their legs are a tangled mess. Wade tries to separate, to drag himself out from under Peter, but Peter protests.\n\u201cNo, no, no. Stop, stay,\u201d he says, clinging, curling his fingers into the fabric of Wade\u2019s suit. He rests his head on Wade\u2019s chest and wills him to be still. \u201cI\u2019m- I\u2019ll be fine, I\u2019m just\u2026\u201d He trails off as Wade settles beneath him. Wade is so warm and he smells masculine and familiar and Peter can hear his heartbeat, fast and a little erratic.\nPeter doesn\u2019t protest in the slightest when Wade winds his arms around him. He strokes his fingers down Peter\u2019s spine, soothing. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, baby boy, just get some rest. You\u2019ll heal up in no time. This is nothing for the amazing Spider-Man, right? Shrug it off, kiddo, you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\nPeter isn\u2019t sure if Wade is babbling for his own benefit or for Peter\u2019s but Peter appreciates it either way. He can feel the vibrations of Wade\u2019s voice through his chest. It pulls him under, lulling him to sleep. He\u2019d swear that just before he drops off, Wade brushes a kiss against his temple, but maybe that\u2019s just a dream.\n-\nThere\u2019s no confusion the next morning. Peter wakes up and he knows where he is and exactly how he got there. He\u2019s in Wade\u2019s living room, and that\u2019s Wade breathing deep and even beneath him. Those are Wade\u2019s arms wrapped around him. That\u2019s Wade\u2019s heartbeat in his ears, much slower and steadier, now.\nThe only surprise lies in the fact that Peter doesn\u2019t want to move. Wade is firm and solid beneath him and Peter feels- warm and safe and surprisingly well-rested, all things considered. It should feel awkward, shouldn\u2019t it? Somehow, it doesn\u2019t, not even when Wade begins to stir, waking slowly to the world around him. Peter doesn\u2019t feel a need to run for the hills, or even really a need to move, especially not when Wade\u2019s hold on him only tightens as he wakes.\n\u201cPsst, Spidey, you awake?\u201d Wade stage-whispers. He pokes the side of Peter\u2019s face.\nPeter nods. Wade sounds different in the morning. He absently files that information away.\n\u201cOh, good. So you didn\u2019t die after all. But what the fuck is it with you and my couch? Do- do spiders like couches? Is that a thing?\u201d\nPeter groans. He takes Wade\u2019s nonsensical question as his cue to finally move. He rolls off of the mercenary and into a sitting position on the floor. \u201cI think,\u201d he says slowly, taking note of the dull throb behind his eyes and the slight nausea making his stomach churn. \u201cThat I feel hungover. Which sucks, because I didn\u2019t even get the fun part of being drunk.\u201d\n\u201cOooh, I bet that\u2019d be fun. Drunk Spider-Man. You know, if you were legal.\u201d Wade sits up. His mask went slightly askew at some point during the night but he fixes it quick enough. His gloves are missing, Peter notices. He isn\u2019t sure if Wade lost them last night or removed them himself. \u201cHow\u2019s your leg?\u201d\nPeter turns it over to examine the cut on his calf. \u201cWell, it stopped bleeding,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I should probably disinfect it before we wind up having to amputate.\u201d\nWade stands and offers a hand up to Peter, who takes it gladly. \u201cCome on, I\u2019ve got stuff for that in the bathroom.\u201d\n\u201cDisinfectant stuff? But I thought you didn\u2019t need that kind of thing?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Wade agrees, and elaborates no further.\nWade\u2019s bathroom is much like the rest of his apartment. Sort of dingy and cluttered but clean enough that Peter doesn\u2019t have any qualms about hopping up on the counter when Wade directs him to.\nWade cleans the wound like he\u2019s done it a thousand times before. First, he cleans around it with a wet rag, getting at all the dried blood that Peter\u2019s suit will allow him to. He\u2019s gentle, surprisingly so. He even lets the water warm up a little before he takes it to Peter\u2019s skin. He warns Peter before he pours the alcohol on but still says \u201csorry, sorry\u201d when Peter hisses in pain. Finally, he tapes the bandage on with careful fingers, pressing lightly. At the end of it all, he calls Peter a good patient and coos, \u201cDo you want a lollipop?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I want whatever lollipop you\u2019re offering,\u201d Peter quips.\n\u201cGutter mind,\u201d Wade snipes back. He\u2019s standing between Peter\u2019s legs, now, arms braced on the countertop. Peter just really, really wants to see his face. He wants to be able to read what he\u2019s thinking there, to know the shape of his eyes and the curve of his smile. He doesn\u2019t know why. It\u2019s irrational and unfair but he can\u2019t help it. He stares hard at Wade\u2019s oh-so-familiar mask, tries to imagine what lies beneath it, but his imagination, he\u2019s sure, doesn\u2019t do the real thing justice.\nPeter raises his hand slowly, makes no sudden movements. Wade still flinches, ever so slightly, when Peter\u2019s fingers come to rest on the curve of his cheekbone. Then, he stills beneath the touch and waits.\n\u201cDo you ever take it off?\u201d Peter wonders. He touches Wade\u2019s brow bone, follows it down to the slope of his nose.\n\u201cNot around you,\u201d Wade answers honestly.\nPeter places his fingers over Wade\u2019s lips, then lets his hand drop. \u201cWhy not?\u201d\nWade shakes his head. He creates space between them, backing up until Peter has room to hop down. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he says, dismissive. Then, \u201cDo you wanna grab breakfast? I could really go for some pancakes.\u201d\nPeter lets him get away with the subject change, but not happily. \u201cSure,\u201d he says and decides that this may not be the worst morning he\u2019s ever had.\nPeter keeps checking his phone. Or, not his phone, the phone Wade gave him. He does it almost absently, pulling it from his pocket, flipping it open, then closed, then slipping it away again. He\u2019d just- he\u2019d thought that when Wade, notorious Spider-Man fanboy, got ahold of a way to contact him, he\u2019d be hearing from the man nonstop. So far- nothing. Actually, Peter hasn\u2019t heard a peep out of him since their pancake breakfast two mornings ago. He\u2019s not worried but he is miffed.\nPeter considers texting him first but... What if Wade doesn\u2019t want to hear from him? What if Peter crossed some sort of line the last time they were together without even realizing it? What if Wade was serious about the whole emergencies only thing? Why is Peter stressing over it like this?\nAs the elevator doors slide open, Peter slips the phone back into his pocket.\nThe Bugle is always a bustling place, even on an otherwise calm weekday. People are walking briskly here and there, shuffling papers. Faxes are being sent and mouses are being clicked and keys are being typed and conversations are being held, some louder than others. That\u2019s why Peter doesn\u2019t hear it at first. In fact, he doesn\u2019t hear anything out of the ordinary until he\u2019s a scant few feet from Jameson\u2019s door.\n\u201c- fucking redact it! Redact it!\u201d\nPeter freezes. He listens harder.\n\u201cRedact-? Do you even know what that means, kid? I can\u2019t redact it! It\u2019s out there! You can\u2019t un-print what\u2019s been printed!\u201d That\u2019s Jameson\u2019s voice, sounding more annoyed than usual, which is an impressive feat. Peter is pretty sure he recognizes the other voice as well, though he\u2019s quietly hoping he\u2019s wrong.\n\u201cYou better find a way or I\u2019ll\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll what?\u201d Jameson challenges.\n\u201cYou better be real fucking glad that Spider-Man doesn\u2019t want me killing. He\u2019s the only goddamn reason your brains aren\u2019t paste right now, you get me?\u201d\nDefinitely Wade, then, sounding downright scary. It\u2019s as if Peter conjured him there just by thinking about him. He places his hand on the knob, intending to interrupt before Deadpool decides he no longer cares what Spider-Man thinks of him and offs Jameson in a fit of annoyance.\n\u201cListen,\u201d Wade continues, taking the murderous tone down a notch or two, maybe even attempting to sound reasonable. Peter pauses again, silently scolding himself for eavesdropping even as he continues to do just that. \u201cSpider-Man, he\u2019s- he won\u2019t like this. This makes him look bad, see?\u201d\n\u201cIf you think I give a fig what Spider-Man thinks, you\u2019re dead wrong. He\u2019s a menace! Do you even read our paper, son? We\u2019re always printing stories like this. They sell and they get the truth out there.\u201d\n\u201cBut I am not okay with contributing to Spider-Man slander! He can\u2019t be seen with me. Not- not like this. It\u2019s not good, it\u2019s-\u201c\nPeter, feeling some combination of touched, confused, and worried, finally decides to cut in. He swings the door open, surprising both Jameson and Wade. \u201cIf it\u2019s written, it\u2019s libel.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Jameson snaps, at the same time Wade asks, \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cIf it\u2019s written, it\u2019s libel. Not slander,\u201d Peter explains. Wade is wearing a hoodie over his suit again. This one has the word meh printed across the front in bold letters. His pouches and weapons are nowhere to be seen.\n\u201cPeter! What are you doing here?\u201d Wade opens his arms like he might go in for a hug. He doesn\u2019t, though, just gestures widely. \u201cWaaaaait a minute. Peter Parker. I knew I knew that name from somewhere- you take Spider-Man\u2019s picture all the time!\u201d\nPeter fidgets. \u201cUm, yeah-\u201c\n\u201cDid you take this?\u201d Wade picks a paper up off of Jameson\u2019s desk and thrusts it angrily under Peter\u2019s nose. There\u2019s a picture of Spider-Man and Deadpool on the front page, probably taken after their run-in with the mercenary woman. It\u2019s grainy, clearly not professional, snapped with a cell phone camera or something of the like. In it, the two of them are leaning on each other, seemingly walking arm in arm. In reality, Peter knows, he was hanging on to Wade to keep from falling on his ass.\nThe headline reads, SPIDER-MAN GETTING CHUMMY WITH FELLOW MASKED FREAK. The article details an eyewitness account of the two of them making their way down the street that night and recounts a few of Wade\u2019s less charming public outings, including the time he slaughtered several people on a highway overpass. Peter would like to believe it\u2019s an over-exaggerated retelling.\n\u201cNo, wasn\u2019t me,\u201d he tells Wade matter-of-factly. \u201cFirst of all, look at the quality, and secondly, I don\u2019t have to resort to sleazy pap shots.\u201d This last is meant mostly for Jameson, who gives him the stink eye. \u201cWade, I wouldn\u2019t take your picture without your permission. Not ever.\u201d\n\u201cYou know this bozo, Parker?\u201d Jameson asks. \u201cWhy am I not surprised? And why am I not calling the cops right now?\u201d\nPeter ignores him. Wade is being too quiet. \u201cYou believe me, right?\u201d\nWade clears his throat. \u201cI- yeah. Thanks, Petey. But that doesn\u2019t solve my current conundrum. Spider-Man\u2019s panties are gonna be in a wad when he sees this. You know, if he wore any. I\u2019m pretty sure he doesn\u2019t. The suit\u2019s too tight, right? He\u2019d have a panty line visible from space.\u201d He pauses as if Peter is going to either confirm or deny that Spider-Man goes commando. Peter doesn\u2019t, so Wade plows on. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to get on his good side and this is gonna set me back several fucking light-years. I know he doesn\u2019t wanna be seen with me-\u201c\n\u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d Peter wonders. The two of them had, after all, just gone out to breakfast together for all the city to see and Peter can\u2019t recall ever insinuating he wouldn\u2019t want to be associated with Deadpool even if it is, technically, true- or rather, it used to be true. Now Peter finds he\u2019s\u2026 mostly okay with it. Or, not okay. It\u2019s bad, in some ways. The Avengers aren\u2019t going to like it. The X-Men aren\u2019t going to like it. It\u2019s going to give some people a sour taste in their mouth about Spider-Man. He\u2019s not angry about it the way he would\u2019ve been a few weeks ago, though.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just common sense,\u201d Wade says, as though Peter is being dense. \u201cHe\u2019s a hero. I\u2019m a killer. He\u2019s got a reputation that needs to stay untarnished. People look up to him, like little kids and stuff. It\u2019s alright if he\u2019s seen with me every now and then, out in the city, but making the front page? With a headline like that? That\u2019s a big deal.\u201d\nStrange how Wade is only saying exactly what Peter\u2019s been thinking, but now that it\u2019s been said all Peter wants to do is contradict it. He opens his mouth to do just that but Wade interrupts him with a curse. \u201cAnd now,\u201d he says dramatically, moving his limbs in a way that somehow suggests an eye roll. For someone whose face is always covered, he\u2019s incredibly expressive. \u201cYou probably don\u2019t want anything to do with me, either, since now you know I\u2019m a killer. Shit.\u201d\nPeter blinks. He tries to do a mental run-through of his other two out-of-costume encounters with Wade. It\u2019s so hard to remember what Peter knows and what Spider-Man knows and keep them separate, but he's pretty sure Wade is right. He\u2019d never mentioned his occupation to Peter. He only has about half a second to decide whether or not to play dumb. He settles on not.\n\u201cI know what you are,\u201d Peter carefully informs him. \u201cI recognized the suit, the first time we met.\u201d That\u2019s plausible, right? Peter is supposedly friends with Spider-Man, after all. It wouldn\u2019t be ridiculous for him to have heard of Deadpool.\nWade tilts his head to the side, considering. \u201cAnd you still\u2026?\u201d\nJameson makes a disgusted noise. \u201cWould you two take this somewhere else? If this idiot isn\u2019t gonna kill me, I\u2019ve gotta get back to work.\u201d\nPeter is almost glad for the interruption.\n\u201cListen, mustache,\u201d Wade growls, pivoting on his heel to point menacingly at Jameson. \u201cMaybe this can\u2019t be undone but if you ever even mention me in your paper again, especially alongside Spider-Man, I\u2019ll come back here with a sword and gut you like a fish in front of your entire fucking staff.\u201d He pauses, then lightly knocks the snow globe on Jameson\u2019s desk onto the floor. It rolls and disappears beneath a filing cabinet. That done, he turns to leave.\n\u201cI wish you would, you pansy,\u201d Jameson snaps at Wade\u2019s retreating back. Wade flips him off.\nPeter scurries after Wade, eager to give Jameson time to calm down. It seems like every eye in the office tracks them as Peter walks with Wade to the elevators, some with fear and some with curiosity. If Wade is bothered it doesn't show.\n\u201cI can take it from here, Petey,\u201d Wade tells him, jabbing the down button with more force than is strictly necessary. \n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll- I\u2019ll ride down with you. No one will miss me for a few minutes.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t get enough, huh?\u201d Wade teases. \u201cEven after I threatened to murderize your boss. Someone\u2019s got it bad for the ol\u2019 Wadester.\u201d\nPeter rolls his eyes. Wade tuts.\n\u201cDon\u2019t deny it. I can see it in your big, beautiful doe eyes. But who can blame you? I mean, have you seen this physique?\u201d Wade flexes. Pointlessly. His hoodie is too baggy. Peter knows all about his \u2018physique\u2019, though. Like Spider-Man, Deadpool\u2019s costume leaves little to the imagination.\nPeter had almost forgotten Wade could see his face. He prays the poor lighting in the elevator obscures the way his cheeks have gone pink. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says, attempting to play it off. He presses the lobby button before Wade has a chance to attack it. \u201cToo bad your \u2018heart belongs to someone else\u2019. How\u2019s that going, by the way?\u201d Peter would be lying if he said he wasn\u2019t just a little interested in the answer.\nWade shrugs. \u201cHe\u2019s too good for me. Hard to believe, I know, but it\u2019s true. And, actually, I\u2019m not even sure he\u2019s into dick? I forget not everyone is\u2026 like me.\u201d\nPeter blinks. \u201cAnd what are you like? If you don\u2019t mind me asking, I mean.\u201d\n\u201cHell if I know what kinda fancy label I\u2019m supposed to put on it. Dick, boobs, both, neither- what\u2019s it matter? They\u2019re all just parts. This time those parts happen to belong to a dude, but it\u2019s the dude I like, not the parts. You follow?\u201d\n\u201cMakes sense. You could always ask him.\u201d Peter tries to remember if Wade has ever mentioned any other guys in his life, or anyone else, period. He hasn\u2019t, either to Spider-Man or to Peter, but that doesn\u2019t mean other people don\u2019t exist in his world. Peter is well aware that Deadpool must have his secrets, same as Spider-Man. A family, maybe? Friends? Colleagues?\n\u201cOh, yeah, sure. Just drop that into casual conversation. \u2018Uh, hey, bro, just wondering- do you get hard for guys, too, or is your penis only into vagina\u2019?\u201d\nPeter laughs. \u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t phrase it like that.\u201d\nWade waves a dismissive hand. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter anyway. Like I said, he\u2019s too good for me. Just like you.\u201d\n\u201cMe?\u201d\n\u201cYes, you adorable little nerd, you.\u201d Wade reaches over to ruffle Peter\u2019s already-ruffled hair. Peter scowls and attempts to coax it back into place. The elevator dings and the doors slide open. \u201cThat\u2019s my cue!\u201d Wade chirps. \u201cI\u2019ll be seeing you, Petey!\u201d He blows a kiss over his shoulder just as the doors start to slide shut again. Peter mimes catching it, mostly in the hopes that it will make Wade smile.\nOf course, when Peter arrives back in the office, everyone is watching him with questions in their eyes. Maureen is the only one to approach him. She\u2019s one of his few friends at work so he obliges when she grills him about Deadpool, and about what went down in Jameson\u2019s office. He carefully omits any of the more personal details of their acquaintance, mostly out of habit. Being overly cautious and private is second nature, now. It's for the best.\n-\nPeter is just getting home when the phone rings. The phone. The Deadpool one. It startles him so much he almost drops his camera.\nThe ringtone is Call Me Maybe and, Peter discovers when he flips the phone open, Deadpool has set his own name as Sexy Mofo. There\u2019s a tiny picture of him throwing up the peace sign. It\u2019s ridiculous\u2026 but it makes Peter smile.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d is his greeting of choice, after some deliberation. Hello would\u2019ve been too formal and yeah too dismissive.\n\u201cSpidey, hey! I was hoping you\u2019d pick up. Have you\u2026 had a chance to look at the paper today?\u201d There\u2019s a lot of background noise. It sounds like Wade must be out somewhere. Funny, to imagine him strolling casually down the sidewalk whilst on the phone with Spider-Man and undoubtedly decked out in all his gear.\n\u201cYeah, um. My friend, Peter- Peter Parker- said you stopped by the Bugle today. And that you seemed pretty upset.\u201d Even after all this time, it\u2019s still strange to refer to himself in the third person.\n\u201cOh.\u201d Wade hesitates. \u201cYou guys talk, huh?\u201d\n\u201cSometimes.\u201d\n\u201cRight\u2026 Did he say anything else, because-\u201c\n\u201cHe said you threatened to gut his boss like a fish.\u201d\n\u201cThat was\u2026 a joke. Mostly. Kind of. Listen- I called because I want you to know I had nothing to do with that story getting published but I totally understand if you want me to skip town, now. It doesn\u2019t look good, I get it, I\u2019m-\u201c\n\u201cWade, stop,\u201d Peter interrupts, aware that Wade would probably keep babbling until he cuts in. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to leave. I get crap like that printed about me all the time. No one who matters will pay any attention to it.\u201d He has no idea if he\u2019s bullshitting or not. He just knows he doesn\u2019t want Wade to leave. Silly, that. But it makes sense, doesn\u2019t it? He\u2019s pulled Peter\u2019s ass out of the fire twice now. Having him around is clearly not a bad thing.\n\u201c\u2026 You sure?\u201d Wade ventures. The background noise has quieted down some like maybe Wade ducked into a building or off onto a side street.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d Peter promises.\nWade blows out a breath. \u201cThat\u2019s a relief. I\u2019m- oh. My date is here. Gotta go, Spides! Talk to you later. Thanks again!\u201d\nThe line abruptly goes dead. Peter lowers the phone, stares at it where it rests in his palm.\n\u201cDate?\u201d he asks, dumbfounded. The phone chooses not to shed any light on the subject and Peter is ashamed to admit he spends the rest of his night wondering who on earth Wade might be on a date with.\n-\nWade calls again at 5:48 in the morning. Peter knows that\u2019s what time it is because when he blinks his eyes open he happens to be facing a clock. It takes him several groggy seconds to realize those are the muffled strains of Call Me Maybe he\u2019s hearing.\nHe digs the phone out from under his pillow, where he doesn\u2019t remember placing it, and answers with a sleep-deprived, incoherent grumble.\n\u201cOh, did I wake you up? What time is it?\u201d\nPeter runs a hand through his hair. It\u2019s sticking up in all directions, he can feel it. \u201cToo early,\u201d he complains. \u201cPlease tell me you aren\u2019t just calling to gossip.\u201d\n\u201cNope. I\u2019m calling in that favor you owe me. And also,\u201d Wade giggles. \u201cYou sound adorable when you wake up.\u201d\nThe first part of that gets Peter\u2019s attention. He sits up. \u201cAre you in trouble? What\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, everything\u2019s fine. I got this gig I need help with.\u201d\nPeter frowns at his closet door. \u201cAs in, a mercenary gig? I told you, I won\u2019t-\u201c\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like that, Spidey. Come on, give me some credit. It\u2019s a good guy gig. I mean, yeah, this rich old fuck is paying me a shit ton of money to do it, but it\u2019s definitely not gonna give anyone any bad karma. Someone stole something from him, he wants us to steal it back. Or, me, actually, but it\u2019ll be a hell of a lot easier if you help.\u201d\nPeter feels woefully unprepared to listen to any of this at the moment but he soldiers on. \u201cDetails,\u201d he demands, giving up on sleep entirely. He pushes the covers off himself and trudges into his kitchen to make coffee. He notices, absently, that his pajama pants are too long. They\u2019re dragging the floor.\n\u201cOkay, so. Some bad guys took this ancient, expensive artifact from our guy, who\u2019s a collector or something. I dunno. I tend to zone out for the exposition. Anyway, they\u2019re holding it at this mansion up in Colorado. It\u2019s some real Mission Impossible shit. They\u2019ve got it in this vault thing, right, and guarded by these gun-toting bastards, and the room it\u2019s in has a pressure-sensitive floor. Which is where you come in, my wall-crawling comrade. I can get you in, no problem, then all you have to do is snag the stupid thing and we can be on our merry way, no casualties or anything. Probably.\u201d\nPeter sighs. \u201cI dunno, Wade-\u201c\n\u201cI\u2019ll split the money with you. Fifty-fifty. That\u2019s twenty-five thousand dollars for a day's work, Spides. Or two days, I guess. We\u2019ve gotta head up there early for some recon. But your part- just a day. And not even a whole day! Probably just, like, an hour!\u201d\nThat gives Peter pause. \u201cIt\u2026 wouldn\u2019t be a favor if you paid me\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t sweat it. It\u2019s not like I need the money. So, you in?\u201d\nPeter bites his lip. On the one hand, he does owe Wade. Twice over, in fact. On the other hand, shady work. But back on the first hand, twenty-five thousand dollars\u2026 and it\u2019s not like anyone has to know Spider-Man is getting paid to help out some poor old man who got robbed. That\u2019s all people will see, right? Spider-Man helping out?\n\u201cFine. When do we leave?\u201d\n\u201cI feel ridiculous,\u201d Peter announces.\nWade doesn\u2019t look up from where he\u2019s tinkering with something at the kitchen table. \u201cWhy\u2019d you come in through the window? You always come in through the window. I have a perfectly good door, you know.\u201d\nPeter drops his duffel bag in the recliner and goes to peek over Wade\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s the civvies,\u201d he says, ignoring Wade\u2019s question. \u201cIt feels weird to be wearing them and my mask.\u201d\nWade finally glances over. He scoffs. \u201cYou look fine. And I do mean fine. So shut up and hand me that screwdriver over there.\u201d He gestures vaguely behind himself.\nIt takes Peter a moment to locate said screwdriver. For some reason, it\u2019s sitting in the spoon rest by the stove. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asks, passing it over. The thing in Wade\u2019s hands is a strip of black leather, like a belt, with some kind of gizmo attached. The face of the gizmo is removed, revealing its innards, which Wade seems to be tampering with.\n\u201cShh,\u201d Wade shushes him. \u201cJust- stand over there and look pretty for a minute while I concentrate. But not too pretty, that would be distracting.\u201d There\u2019s a click. \u201cOh- wait! I got it! Yes!\u201d He slides the faceplate back into place and stands, hoisting the belt victoriously.\n\u201c\u2026Yay?\u201d Peter ventures. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cThis, my arachnid friend, is a teleportation belt. An old buddy made it for me but I hardly ever use it since it\u2019s about as reliable as\u2026 something that\u2019s not reliable.\u201d\n\u201cDid anyone ever tell you you\u2019ve got a way with words?\u201d\nWade waves him off. \u201cIt was on the fritz but I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve got it working well enough to get us to Colorado and back.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re teleporting there? Wait- what if it doesn\u2019t work?\u201d\nWade shrugs, which is the opposite of reassuring. \u201cGrab your bag. This should take us straight to the hotel.\u201d\nPeter does as instructed. Wade holds the belt in one hand, his own bag slung over his shoulder, and curls his fingers around Peter\u2019s wrist with the other. \u201cYou might wanna hold your breath and close your eyes,\u201d he says. \u201cMy first time wasn\u2019t very fun.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what she said,\u201d Peter mumbles, but he does as asked. He almost wants to leave his eyes open, just out of curiosity. He\u2019s sure it would look quite strange. It feels quite strange, at any rate. One second Wade is beside him, breathing and holding his wrist and Peter can hear cars passing by outside and Wade\u2019s neighbors stomping around upstairs. The next, all that disappears. All the noise just stops, all at once, and Peter can\u2019t feel Wade beside him anymore. He only feels like some invisible weight is pressing in on him from all sides, making it difficult to breathe. Then, a split second later, the weight disappears, and sound returns. Different sounds, though. Wade, still beside him, but also people talking and papers shuffling and wheeled suitcases rolling across tile floors.\nPeter opens his eyes. They\u2019ve arrived in the lobby of a hotel. There\u2019s a lady in a pants suit standing three feet to their right who looks very surprised to see them.\nWade cheers, letting go of Peter\u2019s wrist. \u201cWe made it! And all in one piece, too! You are in one piece, right?\u201d\n\u201cUh.\u201d Peter looks down at himself. \u201cYeah, seems that way.\u201d\nThe surprised lady looks around like she\u2019s wondering if she\u2019s the only one who saw two masked men materialize out of thin air. Wade pushes her aside on his way to the front desk, where he leans casually and dings the service bell three times, despite the attendant standing right in front of him. The attendant\u2019s smile bravely persists. She doesn\u2019t even look curious about their attire.\n\u201cReservation for Wilson,\u201d Wade says. The attendant passes him two key cards, one of which Wade then passes to Peter.\n\u201cThis is a really nice hotel\u2026\u201d Peter notes as they make their way toward the elevator. There\u2019d been a marble fountain in the lobby. Everyone, patrons and staff alike, is in suits.\n\u201cDeadpool travels in style,\u201d Wade says. Then, \u201cThanks for coming with, by the way. I figured you\u2019d turn me down since I didn\u2019t give you a lot of notice. You seem like the type who\u2019d have plans already, big hero that you are.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I did. I\u2019m missing school, for one thing.\u201d The elevator moves quietly, smoothly. One wall is glass, allowing Peter to look down on the lobby as they rise.\n\u201cYou go to school?\u201d\nPeter\u2019s brain catches up with his mouth and he realizes he hadn\u2019t meant to admit to that. \u201cUh\u2026 yes?\u201d\n\u201cYou sure? You don\u2019t sound sure.\u201d\nPeter scratches at the back of his neck. \u201cI, uh. Just don\u2019t normally tell people stuff like that. That\u2019s all.\u201d\nWade snorts. \u201cWhat, like I could find you just because I know you\u2019re a student? Only you and about a million other twenty-year-olds. Geez, Spidey, you\u2019re a little paranoid.\u201d\n\u201cYou think?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. I mean, what\u2019s the worst that could happen if someone found out who you are, anyway?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026 They could go after my family and friends?\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Wade considers this. \u201cGuess I didn\u2019t think of that. Don\u2019t really\u2026 have any family or friends to speak of\u2026 Well, there\u2019s Nate, but he can take care of himself.\u201d\n\u201cNate? Is he the one you were on a date with?\u201d\nWade stares at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cThe other night, you said-\u201c\n\u201cOh. Oh, no. It wasn\u2019t really a date, Spidey. It was a meeting. About this job.\u201d \n\u201cAh,\u201d Peter says, feeling foolish even though he\u2019d had no way of knowing that. The elevator arrives at their floor and they file out into the hall. Wade leads the way to their room, Peter trailing along at his side.\nWade snickers, pokes Peter in the shoulder. \u201cYou were jealous.\u201d\nPeter pokes him right back. \u201cWas not,\u201d he argues.\n\u201cWere too! I could hear it in your voice. You were totally jealous that I was on a date with someone else.\u201d\nPeter thinks back. Had he sounded jealous? He hadn\u2019t meant to. Was he jealous? He\u2019s\u2026 kind of relieved that Wade wasn\u2019t on a date but that doesn\u2019t count, right? It doesn\u2019t mean anything.\nThankfully he\u2019s saved having to reply by their arrival at their room. It\u2019s a perfectly nondescript door. Peter is expecting a basic room- two beds and a bathroom, maybe a desk or a chair in the corner if the hotel is really trying to dress things up. What he gets instead is a suite. There\u2019s a bedroom, a living room, a mini-kitchen, and a bathroom with a jacuzzi tub. Everything is ornate and lavishly decorated. The TV takes up almost an entire wall and by itself probably costs more than Peter\u2019s monthly rent. The place is nicer than his and Wade\u2019s apartments combined.\nPeter pauses in the doorway to take it all in. Wade shoulders past him, unfazed. \u201cDibs on the bed by the window!\u201d\n\u201c\u2026 Wade,\u201d Peter says. Then, \u201cWhy?\u201d\nWade pokes his head back out of the bedroom. \u201cWhy the window bed? Because look at this fucking view! That shit\u2019s top dollar.\u201d\nPeter shakes his head. \u201cNo, I meant\u2026 We\u2019re just staying for a night, right?\u201d\n\u201cOh, yeah. I just told them to give me whatever was available. Seriously, come look at the view.\u201d He takes Peter\u2019s hand and pulls him toward the bedroom windows, which are covered with heavy velvet curtains. Wade pulls one aside so Peter can see the outdoors.\nThey\u2019re in the mountains. High up, from the looks of it. Outside is a winter wonderland, a beautiful blue sky, and a row of snow-capped mountain peaks. Trees dot the landscape, appearing here and there where the snow allows. It\u2019s beautiful, like something Peter might\u2019ve seen on a postcard once.\n\u201cWow,\u201d he breathes. \u201cI\u2019ve never been in the mountains before. Or too many places out of the city, really.\u201d\n\u201cYou gotta live a little,\u201d Wade tells him, clapping him on the back. \u201cAnd now I\u2019ve gotta go to work. There\u2019s recon to do and the sooner I do it, the sooner it\u2019ll be done.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, already? We just got here.\u201d\n\u201cI know you\u2019ll be bored to tears without me but, hey, they\u2019ve probably got pay-per-view porn and I\u2019ve got an unlimited budget. Go nuts, baby boy.\u201d Wade is already unpacking things from his duffel. Weapons, mostly. As Peter watches, he sheds his hoodie and baggy jeans, stripping down to just his suit. He clicks a gun into its holster and straps his sheathes to his back.\n\u201cI am not jerking off in this hotel room. Too weird. When will you be back?\u201d\nWade shoots him a thumbs up. \u201cBefore you know it!\u201d\n\u201cGot your phone on you?\u201d\nWade holds it up in confirmation and pointedly slips it into one of his pouches. \u201cYes, dear.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, good\u2026 Be careful,\u201d Peter can\u2019t help but add, aware that he sounds doting but unable to help it.\n\u201cAlways am,\u201d Wade chirps. He takes Peter by the arm and plants what would be a kiss on his cheek if not for their masks. He makes an over-exaggerated mwah noise and then practically twirls away. \u201cDon\u2019t wait up!\u201d\nOf course Peter does wait up. After Wade leaves, Peter\u2019s first order of business is to call MJ and cancel their plans to see a movie the following night, just in case he doesn\u2019t make it back in time. His excuse is less a mercenary whisked me off to the mountains and more I\u2019ve got all this coursework due and I\u2019m poor. MJ, being the wonderful friend that she is, offers to pay for his ticket but he\u2019s never let her before and he\u2019s not about to start now. Before hanging up, she also accuses him of having what she calls a \u2018secret lover\u2019 and, when he refutes the claim, suggests that he should get one.\nBy the time Wade does finally get back it\u2019s past midnight and Peter has had time to bathe and watch three and a half movies. He comes in and brings the smell of pine with him. Peter is happy to note that there\u2019s not a scratch on Wade anywhere.\n\u201cWell?\u201d Peter says.\n\u201cWe\u2019re good to go tomorrow,\u201d Wade says, collapsing backward onto his bed. Then he says ow, complains that his swords are jabbing him in the back, and removes them. \u201cWhat are we watching?\u201d\nPeter tells him, and Wade proceeds to provide color commentary on the movie Gone Girl for the next hour. It\u2019s very much not a comedy but Peter finds himself laughing harder than he has in a long time. Wade has a talent for that, it would seem.\nIt takes Peter a while to fall asleep. He hates sleeping in his mask but he doesn\u2019t breathe a word of complaint. It\u2019s something he assumes Wade does a lot, if not all the time. Wade doesn\u2019t seem to have any trouble getting to sleep, at any rate. Peter looks over and can\u2019t make much out in the dark but the way Wade\u2019s gone lax, and his chest rises steady and even, suggests that he\u2019s out like a light.\nPeter is finally, finally dozing off when something jolts him back to the world of the alert. It\u2019s Wade, shifting in his bed, mumbling something incoherent under his breath. Peter listens, trying to make it out, trying to figure out if Wade is awake or not. It doesn\u2019t seem like it, and his restlessness quickly turns to thrashing and his voice begins to sound pained.\nPeter shoves his own blankets off and climbs over to Wade\u2019s bed. He perches on the side, not sure what to do. Wade is clearly in distress. In the midst of a nightmare, Peter assumes. \n\u201cWade,\u201d Peter tries, and then again louder. Wade doesn\u2019t respond so Peter reaches out, intending to take him by the arm, but his touch is intercepted. Wade uses one of his hands to grab Peter\u2019s, his grip crushing. The other wraps around Peter\u2019s throat, too fast for Peter to move. Peter\u2019s spider-sense is urging him to get away, to put distance between himself and the danger, but he forces himself to be still.\n\u201cWade,\u201d Peter says, calmly, placing his hand over Wade\u2019s on his throat. Not prying, just touching. He takes it as a good sign that he can still talk, though Wade\u2019s grip is bruising. \u201cIt\u2019s me. It\u2019s just me.\u201d He can\u2019t see Wade\u2019s face, can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s still talking to a sleeping man or if Wade has become aware. Gradually, Wade\u2019s grip on his hand loosens, and then his grip on Peter\u2019s throat. \n\u201cOh, my god,\u201d he says, sitting up, letting go all at once. \u201cI\u2019m- I was having a dream, I think. I\u2019m so sorry, Spidey. Did I hurt you? Please tell me I didn\u2019t hurt you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not a delicate flower,\u201d Peter assures him. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\nWade is shaking. It\u2019s only barely perceptible but Peter can feel it. \u201cYeah. Just. Bad dreams. Bad memories. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He brings his legs up to his chest, wraps his arms around them. It's strange to see someone Peter always thinks of as strong and unshakeable be reduced to comforting himself, making himself as small as possible.\n\u201cDoes that\u2026 happen a lot?\u201d Peter wonders, keeping his voice low. He doesn\u2019t know why, maybe to comfort him or maybe to distract him, but Peter reaches out and takes Wade\u2019s hand in his. Their hands are bare, their gloves abandoned sometime earlier. It\u2019s dark, too dark for Peter to see anything, but he can feel the uneven texture of Wade\u2019s skin, can feel calluses that are just starting to form and it occurs to Peter that this is the hand Wade recently had to regrow. Does it hurt, he wonders? Reforming all those calluses? Wielding blades and guns and getting blisters until they do?\n\u201cNot that much,\u201d Wade says. He curls and uncurls his fingers as Peter traces patterns over his palm. \u201cJust sometimes. Fucking figures it would happen tonight.\u201d\n\u201cWhat were you dreaming about?\u201d\nWade hesitates. Gradually his trembling subsides. Peter thinks he might not ever answer, might deem the information too personal, but then he says, \u201cVanessa. My ex. They killed her.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Peter says, even though he knows it means nothing. The words don\u2019t help, but what else is there to say? \u201cI\u2026 lost someone like that, too. She died because of me.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll start a club,\u201d Wade says, squeezing Peter\u2019s hand. \u201cThe Dead Girlfriend\u2019s club.\u201d\n\u201cHow about just the Tragic Ex\u2019s Club? Cause there was this guy, my best friend. He sort of went completely nuts. He\u2019s locked up now.\u201d\n\u201cHuh,\u201d Wade says, tilting his head. \u201cThere\u2019s\u2026 a lot to process in that sentence. First of all- guy? I was under the impression you were straight, Spidey.\u201d\nPeter smiles. It had been his intention to take Wade\u2019s mind off his nightmare. \u201cWell, we were never\u2026 official. We just fooled around, off and on. Before\u2026 Before my girlfriend. But, no, not straight.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind me,\u201d Wade mumbles. \u201cJust filing this information away.\u201d\nPeter chuckles. \u201cYou gonna be alright?\u201d he asks, letting go of Wade\u2019s hand.\nWade actually seems to think about it for a second. \u201cYeah. Probably.\u201d He catches Peter\u2019s wrist as Peter begins to stand. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 sorry,\u201d he says. \u201cAgain. And thank you, Spidey. Really. I promise I will try to avoid choking you in the future unless you ask nicely.\u201d\nThat startles a laugh out of Peter. \u201cGo to sleep,\u201d he says, aware that he\u2019s blushing. \u201cBig day tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cYes, mum,\u201d Wade chuckles, letting go of him.\nPeter\u2019s bed is cold when he settles back into it.\n-\nPeter is having an unpleasant but admittedly silly dream about showing up to class in his underwear when something wakes him. At first, he isn\u2019t sure what\u2019s done it but then he hears a noise from the other room. A thump, and then footsteps. He rises, groggy and sleep-rumpled, and trudges toward the noise to see what his temporary roommate might be up to.\n\u201cWade?\u201d he calls, rounding the corner.\n\u201cOh, shit, don\u2019t- don\u2019t-\u201c Wade rambles, voice trembling. That, more than anything, is what brings Peter up short. Wade hadn\u2019t even sounded like that after his nightmare. Peter doesn\u2019t register what he\u2019s looking at for another several seconds and when he does it takes his breath away.\nWade must\u2019ve just showered, because the bathroom door stands open, releasing steam into the room, and Wade has a towel draped over his head. He\u2019s turned away from Peter but he\u2019s bare from the waist up, revealing the broad expanse of his back and shoulders, covered in scars. Some angry, some faded, some raised, and some not. Some look like the result of burns while others look inflicted by sharp objects, long and curved. They look awful and painful and Peter has the sudden and unexpected urge to hurt whoever inflicted them.\n\u201cGo back to bed,\u201d Wade snaps. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be asleep.\u201d He\u2019s so stiff, holding himself like he\u2019s anticipating a blow.\nPeter stumbles toward him. He reaches out and this time- this time he touches. He rests his fingers on Wade\u2019s shoulder, bare skin against bare skin, and traces a pattern of scars, marvels at how soft Wade\u2019s skin is, despite the bumps and ridges. Wade flinches, at first, but he doesn\u2019t pull away.\n\u201cI- I can\u2019t find it,\u201d Wade says, crumpling. \u201cMy mask. I can\u2019t find it, Spidey, I\u2019m- I took it off, to take a shower, and now I can\u2019t fucking find it-\u201c\nPeter draws back, shocked. In his sleepy daze, he hadn\u2019t even realized Wade was maskless. As curious as Peter is, as much as he wants to know Wade\u2019s face, he\u2019d never dream of taking that choice away from him. He averts his gaze, though Wade is making sure on his own that Peter isn\u2019t able to see anything. \u201cYou didn\u2019t bring a spare?\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t think I\u2019d need one,\u201d Wade says, brusque.\n\u201cI\u2019ll- I\u2019ll help you look,\u201d Peter offers. \u201cIt\u2019s gotta be here somewhere, right? It\u2019s- oh.\u201d Peter spots red, peeking out from beneath the sofa. Wade\u2019s mask must have fallen there somehow. \u201cHere it is.\u201d Peter bends to retrieve it and hands it over with his eyes steadily fixed on the floor. Wade snatches it back. He slams the bathroom door shut behind him.\nPeter blinks at the closed door. He\u2019d like to ignore it but he knows he feels\u2026 stung. He knows he has no right to expect Wade to open up to him, or go maskless around him, but he still feels somehow hurt that he won\u2019t. Especially since Wade had more or less admitted to him recently that it\u2019s personal. Not around you, he\u2019d said, as though Peter were somehow undeserving or untrustworthy. Even still, after all this time they\u2019ve spent together. Even after last night, when it had seemed like they were making progress.\nHe expects Wade to have calmed down by the time he reappears. He expects him to try and pretend that nothing happened, or to brush the whole incident off with humor.\nHe doesn\u2019t. Instead, Wade remains cold and quiet. Aloof. He shrugs off Peter\u2019s attempts at conversation as he arms himself to the hilt, preparing for their mission.\n\u201cNon-lethal, right?\u201d Peter asks, watching him. It is, after all, supposed to be an easy mission. No casualties. That\u2019s what Wade had said.\nWade doesn\u2019t answer.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Peter mumbles, mostly to himself, sounding weary. \u201cThis should be fun.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s cold,\u201d Peter complains, sinking lower in his coat.\n\u201cNo shit,\u201d Wade murmurs, but he doesn\u2019t seem very cold. He\u2019s laid out in the snow in just his suit, with no coat or any winter gear in sight. He\u2019s been lying like that, almost perfectly still, for the better part of an hour, peering through the scope on a sniper rifle. In front of them, in a small valley between two cliffs, sits the mansion they\u2019re trying to infiltrate. Peter doesn\u2019t know what Wade is watching for. He\u2019d asked and gotten no reply.\nIn fact, most of his questions and attempts at conversation have been brushed off and turned aside. Ever since this morning, when Peter caught Wade in a partial state of undress, he\u2019s been taciturn. Peter was tempted to point out that usually that sort of thing leads to sexy times, not to endless rounds of the quiet game, but he\u2019s pretty sure that with the mood Wade is in the remark would earn him a glare, not a laugh.\nThe fact of the matter is, Peter isn\u2019t quite sure how to treat this new, aloof version of Wade. He\u2019s been replaying the last several hours in his head, wondering what he did wrong, but he can\u2019t pinpoint anything. He's thought about trying to reassure Wade that this morning didn\u2019t change anything but he isn\u2019t sure how to start that conversation. Every time he tries to run through what to say in his head, he gets stuck. Besides, he\u2019s not even sure what, exactly, Wade is upset about. It\u2019s all made for a tense and too-quiet morning.\n\u201cAlmost time,\u201d Wade says. Peter jumps at the sound of his voice. \u201cGrab onto me. As soon as the distraction blows, we\u2019re teleporting in.\u201d\n\u201cBlows?\u201d Peter wonders, but he sheds his coat and dutifully grabs on to Wade\u2019s belt when he stands. Wade straps the sniper rifle to his back.\nAs has become the new norm, Wade ignores him. Peter\u2019s question is answered soon enough, anyway. Within the next minute, an explosion goes off near one end of the house, blowing out a wall and sending smoke and debris into the air.\nWade doesn\u2019t give him any warning before he teleports them. They land in an empty and cavernous concrete room, one wall dominated by a large metal door. Peter struggles to orient himself, feeling dizzy and sick for several seconds. It passes, but slowly. Peter is just proud he manages not to lose his breakfast.\n\u201cHow are we getting that open?\u201d Peter asks, gesturing at the frankly imposing vault door.\nWade is digging around in his satchel. \u201cKey,\u201d he says, but what he pulls out looks less like a key and more like a severed hand. He approaches the door and does something with the hand that causes several locks to click back one at a time. The door swings open a fraction of an inch.\n\u201cHow long has that been in there?\u201d Peter sputters. \u201cHow- why- who- ugh.\u201d\nWade shrugs, tosses the hand carelessly aside. It flops against a wall and falls to the floor. \u201cWe don\u2019t have much time. Those guards won\u2019t stay gone long.\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d Peter mutters. He approaches the vault door, pushes it open just enough to be able to see inside. The room is massive and filled with little glass cases, each proudly displaying what Peter assumes is a priceless artifact. It\u2019s a very odd assortment of things. There are gems and coins and books, which makes sense, but there are also eyeballs floating in blue liquid and a pile of nothing but dust and pieces of broken tech and clothing from bygone eras.\n\u201cEclectic fellow, isn\u2019t he?\u201d\nWade gestures. \u201cTurn on your earpiece. I\u2019m going to go keep a lookout.\u201d\nPeter has to reach up under his mask to fiddle with the small radio Wade supplied him with. He knows it\u2019s on when it briefly supplies feedback which settles into a low electronic hum. \u201cWait- what am I supposed to be grabbing, here? There\u2019s like a million things in that room.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a crystal. Big, blue, floating. You can\u2019t miss it. And remember- don\u2019t touch the floor.\u201d\n\u201cFloating?\u201d Peter asks, but Wade already has his back to him, walking away.\nPeter sighs. He turns back to the room, fires web at the ceiling to pull himself up. From there he has an even better view of all the miscellaneous items. It still takes him a while to find the crystal he\u2019s looking for since it\u2019s situated near the rear of the room, but, true to Wade\u2019s word, he knows it when he sees it. It\u2019s a small blue crystal, hovering about an inch off of a black velvet pillow. It, like everything else, is covered by a glass case.\nIt\u2019s not all that difficult to remove the case. He just attaches web to it and lifts, being careful not to drop it, then webs it to a wall. Retrieving the crystal is no problem either. He wraps it in his web so he doesn\u2019t have to touch it, wary of whatever enchantment is probably placed on it. It\u2019s as he\u2019s in the process of this that his radio crackles to life and Wade says, \u201cShit, they\u2019re coming back.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? What do we do?\u201d Peter looks around. There\u2019s only one way in or out.\n\u201cHurry,\u201d Wade snaps.\nPeter does just that, crawling quickly along the ceiling. He isn\u2019t even halfway out when Wade utters another curse. \u201cI had another distraction planned. Stupid fucking faulty bomb. Didn\u2019t go off.\u201d Here, he cuts out, then Peter hears more cursing.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Peter asks, listening hard. \u201cWade? Are they here?\u201d There\u2019s no answer.\nThe sounds of fighting reach Peter as he draws close to the exit, not through his earpiece but through the vault door, which is still cracked open. He lets himself drop to the floor, braced for whatever might come at him on the other side.\nTurns out he needn\u2019t have worried for himself. No one takes notice of him. Every man in the room is focused on Wade, who is dispatching them with cold, brutal efficiency. At first, Peter is glad to see his guns are still holstered, thinks that maybe Wade is only dealing non-lethal blows, but- no. Wade isn\u2019t pulling any punches. He isn\u2019t sparing anyone. Peter watches as he beheads a man, then opens another from groin to throat. The cement floor is quickly becoming awash with red. Wade is just a blur of motion.\n\u201cWade!\u201d Peter calls, snapping out of his shocked daze. \u201cStop- what are you doing-\u201c\nWade pays him no mind. He\u2019s already felled nearly every guard in the room. By the time Peter jolts himself into action, Wade is cutting the legs from beneath one of only two men left breathing. The last, a man with five o\u2019clock shadow and wide, watery eyes, drops his gun and holds up his hands, surrendering.\nWade advances on the man, blade leaving a trail of dripping blood behind him. He raises his sword and there is no doubt in Peter\u2019s mind that he\u2019s about to slaughter an unarmed, surrendering man. The man seems to know it, too. He squeezes his eyes shut, braces himself against the wall behind him.\n\u201cStop!\u201d Peter yells again. He webs Wade\u2019s sword, yanking it from his hand. Wade turns and Peter imagines that if he could see Wade\u2019s expression it would frighten him. \u201cThat man is unarmed,\u201d Peter tells him, persevering. \u201cDon\u2019t make me subdue you.\u201d\nSomething about Wade\u2019s stance reminds Peter of a coiled snake, ready to strike. He\u2019s powerful. Peter forgets that, sometimes. His physique isn\u2019t for show. He\u2019s lithe and fast and well-trained and strong. Peter has never had to think of Wade in terms of \u2018how would I defeat him\u2019 before. He finds himself doing that now, formulating strategies and calculating his odds and he hates himself for it and he hates Wade just as much for making him do it.\nAll at once, Wade\u2019s demeanor changes. His fingers uncurl from claws and he straightens. He sheathes his remaining sword in one smooth motion and growls, \u201cLet\u2019s fucking go.\u201d\nThe last thing Peter wants to do is touch Wade. He\u2019s covered in blood- largely the blood of his foes, not his own- but he forces himself to do it. He approaches slowly and grabs onto Wade\u2019s wrist so Wade can teleport them away from the heinous scene around them. Peter can\u2019t even look at most of the bodies without wanting to throw up.\nTheir hotel room materializes around them. Peter doesn\u2019t feel as sick this time. At least, not because of the teleportation.\nHe immediately puts distance between himself and Wade, staggering to the other side of the bedroom, but he doesn\u2019t turn his back. He\u2019s afraid to, which is new and terrible and Wade seems to realize it the same instant Peter does.\n\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d Wade snaps.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Peter snaps right back. His heart is racing. He\u2019s still in fight or flight mode.\n\u201cDon\u2019t act like I\u2019m some- deranged lunatic who\u2019s gonna cut you as soon as look at you.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you are. I thought I did but that\u2026 That was-\u201c\n\u201cBusiness as per fucking usual is what that was. I saved the mission. I did what I had to do.\u201d\n\u201cYou slaughtered them! And you were going to kill an unarmed man! Wade, I\u2019ve seen you fight before without killing a soul. I know you can do it, you chose not to. You promised me no causalities. So what was that?\u201d\nWade folds his arms over his chest. \u201cStress relief,\u201d he says.\nPeter makes a noise, part disbelief and part disgust.\n\u201cI did it because I wanted to. Because that\u2019s who I am.\u201d Wade starts to close the distance between them until he\u2019s looming over Peter. Peter has to tilt his chin up. \u201cI\u2019m a killer, Spider-Man. Does that put you off? Does that disgust you? This is who you\u2019ve been palling around with. A professional killer. And guess what? I enjoy my job. I love it. I can\u2019t wait to send poor fucking saps to the afterlife. Straight into Death\u2019s arms. How does that make you feel, hero? You think I\u2019m a psychopath? You wanna lock me up? I\u2019d like to see you try.\u201d\nPeter shakes his head. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? What\u2019s- this isn\u2019t you, I know it\u2019s not.\u201d\nWade scoffs. \u201cWhat do you really know about me, Spidey? Next to fucking nothing. Don\u2019t pretend you\u2019re an authority on all things Deadpool.\u201d\nPeter swallows. He forces himself to take a deep, calming breath. He places his palms flat against Wade\u2019s chest, can feel Wade\u2019s heart rabbiting much the same as Peter\u2019s has been. The touch must surprise Wade because he goes still. He's even holding his breath. \u201cWhat are you trying to do?\u201d Peter asks, lowering his voice. \u201cTrying to scare me off? Trying to see how far you can push me? Why?\u201d\nFor a moment Wade says nothing. He places his gloved hands over Peter\u2019s, holding him there. He\u2019s still covered in blood and smells like copper. \u201cI\u2019m just helping you toward a realization,\u201d he says, and for once in this conversation sounds familiar to Peter.\n\u201cWhat realization is that?\u201d\n\u201cThat I\u2019m no good. That you\u2019re better off as far away from me as you can get. I thought- For a while, I thought it might be good. That you might rub off on me. But I\u2019m no hero, Spidey. I never will be. I\u2019ll never be\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Peter prompts. \n\u201cGood enough,\u201d Wade finishes. He tips his chin down, tries to put distance between them again but Peter doesn\u2019t let him. He clings. \u201cI\u2019ve done things\u2026\u201d Wade continues. \u201cI can\u2019t outrun the past. I can\u2019t get rid of these fucking scars. And I know that no matter how good I am, no matter what I do\u2026 You\u2019ll never want me.\u201d\nPeter\u2019s breath catches in his throat. There haven\u2019t been many times in his life when he\u2019s found himself utterly speechless but this is one of them. He feels like if he speaks he'll choke on the words.\n\u201cWhy would you?\u201d Wade begins to babble into the silence. \u201cI\u2019m a mess, inside and out. What they did to me in Weapon X, it fucked me up, Spidey. There\u2019s no coming back from it. I\u2019ll always be a big, screwed-up piece of work, hurting the people I care about, fucking up the world around me. It was stupid of me to try and get close to you. No good could ever from it.\u201d\n\u201cI- I can\u2019t just- What you did today was\u2026\u201d Peter trails off. He doesn\u2019t know what he wants to say. He doesn\u2019t know what he needs to say. What Wade did today was wrong, there\u2019s no question about it. Peter didn\u2019t much like the side of Wade that he saw in action in that mansion. Still, even with mounting evidence to the contrary, there\u2019s a very large part of Peter that refuses to believe Wade is a monster. He knows Wade isn\u2019t a monster, and Peter has grown too fond of him to let him walk away.\nSince words are failing him, Peter does the only thing he can think to do. He hugs Wade, arms wrapped tight around his waist. He decides he doesn\u2019t care about the blood, he just wants to convey to Wade, somehow, that he isn't a lost cause. Not to Peter.\nWade really is shocked, now. At first, he seems scared to touch Peter. Then, slowly, hesitantly, he returns the embrace, arms enveloping Peter in warmth and the smell of gunpowder.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t get rid of me that easy,\u201d Peter says. \u201cSo for the sake of several poorly trained guards, please stop trying.\u201d\nWade laughs like it\u2019s startled out of him. \u201cYou really should leave,\u201d he says, but he doesn\u2019t let go.\nThere\u2019s apologizing that needs to happen and forgiveness that needs to be worked towards but Peter decides they can figure all that out later. Everyone deserves a second chance. Everyone can change. Even people like Wade, self-proclaimed perpetual fuck up. Peter believes that wholeheartedly, and he\u2019s willing to work to make it happen.\nPeter shifts the curtains aside to take one last look at the scenery. The sun is setting behind the mountains, casting them in shadow. He\u2019s not entirely sad to be returning to the city, to what\u2019s familiar, but he will miss the view. He sort of regrets not getting to make a snowman. He\u2019s sure, with Wade as his company, the activity would\u2019ve been quite the experience.\nBehind him, Wade is packing the last of his things back into his duffel. He\u2019s not saying much. Peter can tell that everything that\u2019s happened over the course of the last two days has somehow shifted their relationship. It is now irreversibly changed, though Peter has no idea if it\u2019s for the better or not. Peter can\u2019t even say how it\u2019s changed, exactly. He just feels it, like a fraying line between them.\nPeter pulls the crystal from his pocket, still wrapped in web. He turns it back and forth in his hands. \u201cSo, what does it do?\u201d he asks, breaking the borderline uneasy silence between them.\n\u201cHell if I know,\u201d Wade admits, hoisting his bag onto his shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t ask too many questions. That\u2019s a quick way to stop getting job offers.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a floating blue crystal that someone just paid you fifty-thousand dollars to retrieve and you\u2019re not even a little curious what it does? Or how it works?\u201d Peter is at least interested in the science behind it if nothing else. It seems a waste to send it back without studying it first, though he knows that\u2019s not an option.\n\u201cAw, Spidey,\u201d Wade says, reaching over to pat him on the head. \u201cSo sweet, so na\u00efve. In my experience, it\u2019s better not to know.\u201d\nPeter passes the crystal over when Wade holds out his hand. It disappears into one of Wade\u2019s pockets. \u201cIt could come back to bite you,\u201d Peter points out, because that\u2019s how these things work in his experience.\n\u201cLook,\u201d Wade says. \u201cI know what\u2019s really bothering you. If this thing turns out to be evil and it kills a bunch of people or wrecks some shit or whatever, you don\u2019t have to worry about being responsible. Alright? I took the job, I roped you in. It\u2019s on me. I\u2019ll even let you say \u2018I told you so\u2019. But if every random object I was paid to fetch wound up being evil and coming back to ruin my life, I\u2019d have given up the business a long time ago.\u201d\nPeter holds up his hands, conceding the point, but he feels compelled to add, \u201cIf it does wind up being evil, I\u2019m definitely gonna say \u2018I told you so\u2019\u2026 But I\u2019ll also be there to help you clean up the mess.\u201d\nWade pauses. \u201cUnless,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s past your bedtime.\u201d\nPeter rolls his eyes. \u201cShut up. Are you ready to go yet?\u201d\nWade nods. He fiddles with the teleportation belt. \u201cAnywhere in particular you wanna get dropped off?\u201d\nPeter considers. Obviously, he can\u2019t say his apartment, but he could at least have Wade get him close. He rattles off a place just a few blocks down. Wade fiddles with the belt some more, then directs Peter to take his arm.\nPeter is more familiar with teleporting now than he ever thought he would be. He\u2019s only a little dizzy when he comes out the other side and it takes him less time to orient himself. The coffee shop is, thankfully, mostly empty at this time of day. The barista looks surprised for half a second to see them appear, then shrugs and goes back to wiping down counters. Peter imagines she probably sees weirder on a weekly basis, knowing this city.\n\u201cOh, hey, I\u2019ve been here before,\u201d Wade notes, looking around with interest.\nPeter freezes. Internally, he berates himself. It\u2019s not that he\u2019d forgotten his maskless meeting with Deadpool here, it\u2019s just that he\u2019d, well. Momentarily forgotten. \n\u201cI sat\u2026 right over there,\u201d Wade says, pointing at the corner table. \u201cAnd then I met this super cute nerd. We totally hit it off, Spidey. I\u2019m pretty sure I caught him checking out my ass, which, by the way, is pretty great. I\u2019ve seen him since, too. I think he likes me.\u201d\nPeter\u2019s panic is derailed. \u201cWait,\u201d he says, coming to a realization. \u201cAre you trying to make me jealous right now?\u201d\n\u201cThat depends. Is it working?\u201d Wade sounds half-joking, half-hopeful.\nPeter decides his life is officially ridiculous. Wade is trying to make him jealous by bragging about flirting with him. This is a situation that never occurred to him when he decided to keep his identity secret. \u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cI am definitely not jealous that you and some nerd flirted with each other.\u201d Wait- flirted with each other? But Peter hadn\u2019t been flirting. Had he?\n\u201cWeirdly specific,\u201d Wade points out. \u201cWhat if I held his hand? Took him on a date? Kissed him? Would that make you jealous?\u201d\nPeter\u2019s cheeks are burning. He mentally adds this to the list of times he\u2019s glad he keeps his face covered. \u201cStill no,\u201d he insists, which is true, but he can\u2019t stop imagining it. Wade kissing him. Him, not Spider-Man. Wade\u2019s hands, large and warm, cupping his face and leaning in, or maybe holding him by the waist, or maybe twining their fingers together. Wade\u2019s face must be scarred, too. What would that feel like? To be kissed by him?\n\u201cWhat if I took my mask off for him?\u201d Wade asks, voice and chin dipping low, unconsciously bringing their faces closer. \u201cBet you\u2019d be jealous then.\u201d\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t.\u201d Peter is practically whispering.\n\u201cI might.\u201d Wade shrugs. \u201cIf he asked nicely. I mean, he\u2019s really cute, Spidey. I\u2019ll probably do just about anything if he bats his eyelashes at me and says please.\u201d\nPeter\u2019s mouth has gone dry. \u201cSo that\u2019s your weakness,\u201d he says, trying to regain some footing. \u201cCute boys.\u201d\nWade chuckles. He nudges Peter with his elbow. \u201cThought you would\u2019ve figured that out by now.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I haven\u2019t gotten you to take your mask off, have I?\u201d\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t tried batting your eyelashes at me, either,\u201d Wade points out. He doesn\u2019t give Peter time to retort before he switches the subject, abruptly announcing at his usual volume, \u201cI\u2019ll let you know when I get our money, then I can give you your half and we can be done with the whole thing.\u201d Just like that, everything is normal again.\nPeter starts shaking his head before Wade is even done talking. \u201cI can\u2019t take the money.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Why? I thought that was the whole reason you took the gig.\u201d\n\u201cI agreed to help because I owed you a favor. The money was just a bonus.\u201d\n\u201cSo\u2026 why can\u2019t you take it? Favor\u2019s repaid, I\u2019m happy to share the loot.\u201d\nPeter shifts awkwardly on his feet. He doesn\u2019t want to start another argument or put more distance between them. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 nothing. I just\u2026 don\u2019t really need it. So you can keep it.\u201d It nearly pains him to say it. That money could do wonders for the mountain of debt he\u2019s burying himself under in college.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a lousy poker face,\u201d Wade tells him. Peter refrains from pointing out how that makes no sense, what with the mask. Besides, he\u2019s right. Peter has never been the best liar, secret identity aside. \u201cWhat\u2019s the real reason?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 I felt okay about it when we were just helping someone, but\u2026\u201d\nPeter can practically see the metaphorical lightbulb go off over Wade\u2019s head. \u201cOh,\u201d he says, flat. Monotone. \u201cIt\u2019s because I killed those people.\u201d\nHesitantly, Peter nods.\n\u201cSo, what, it\u2019s blood money now? Tainted? You know that wasn\u2019t your fault, you had nothing to do with those guys dying-\u201c\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t die, Wade. You had it right the first time. They were killed, and- No, I don\u2019t want to argue about this. I just wouldn\u2019t feel right about it, okay? About taking the money. Can you just accept that?\u201d\nThe barista is definitely eyeballing them now. Peter lowers his voice again, though it\u2019s probably too late to pretend they weren\u2019t talking about murdering people. She\u2019ll undoubtedly be texting all her friends in a minute about how Spider-Man killed a dude. Great. \u201cLike I said, I went because I owed you. Not for the money. So don\u2019t worry about it, alright? I\u2019ll be fine. We\u2019re fine.\u201d\nFor a second it seems like Wade might push the issue, but then he gives in with a little huff. \u201cDid anyone ever tell you you\u2019re a stubborn little shit when you want to be?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a compliment.\u201d\n\u201cYou should. I like it.\u201d Wade steps back. He offers up a salute, half-hearted and largely sarcastic. \u201cI\u2019ll see you around, Spidey.\u201d\nPeter salutes him back and in the next instant, he\u2019s gone, leaving Peter with the sinking feeling he won\u2019t be seeing Wade for a while.\n-\nHe\u2019s right. Wade disappears. Whether he\u2019s still in the city or not, Peter isn\u2019t sure. He keeps an eye out for him on patrols, can\u2019t seem to help it, but he never does spot him.\nHe thinks about texting him. A text is harmless, right? Wade could ignore it if he\u2019s trying to get some space or take a break from\u2026 whatever they are. If he\u2019s trying to take a break from Peter. Peter never can bring himself to do it, though, too afraid that Wade really would ignore the message and too afraid to find out how much that would sting.\nThings stay quiet around the city so Peter has little to no Spider-Man business to distract him. Instead, he throws himself into his studies. He spends time with MJ and has lunch with Aunt May and makes Jameson happy with some new pictures. With every day that passes, he wonders more and more where Wade might be, what he might be doing, and whether or not he might be in trouble.\nIt turns out he needn\u2019t have worried. He finally spots Wade during one of his patrols, almost three weeks after their last meeting. At first, he thinks his eyes are playing tricks but- no. That\u2019s Wade walking down the sidewalk, hands stuffed in his pockets, iconic mask peeking out from beneath a hood he has pulled low.\nPeter follows him. He swings from rooftop to rooftop, careful to keep out of sight. Wade never looks up. If he realizes he has someone tailing him, he doesn\u2019t give it away.\nPeter doesn\u2019t have to follow for long. Two blocks down, Wade enters an otherwise empty diner. From Peter\u2019s vantage point across the road, he sees Wade take a seat, sees a waitress with a bored expression come and hand him a menu, sees Wade scan it, and then put it back down. He pulls out a knife and begins picking at his nails. The waitress, when she comes back to take his order, eyes him uneasily.\nPeter thinks about leaving. He could just walk away and let Wade continue his recluse act. The thought quickly passes, though. Even if Wade wants to be left alone, it isn\u2019t in Peter to grant that wish. Instead, he drops down to the ground and pulls the diner door open. The waitress lays eyes on him and breaks into a grin.\n\u201cAre you really Spider-Man?\u201d she asks, excited, and Peter thinks that even if he weren\u2019t he\u2019d say yes just to avoid disappointing her.\nShe seems a little confused when he takes the seat across from Wade, who has yet to look up from his own hands. They\u2019re bare, no gloves, and once again Peter finds himself fascinated by the mercenary\u2019s scars. They\u2019re beautiful in their own strange and terrible way. They tell a story and they\u2019re a part of who Wade is. Perhaps that\u2019s why Peter rather likes them.\n\u201cHi,\u201d Peter says, when it becomes clear that Wade won\u2019t be the first to speak.\n\u201cHi,\u201d Wade parrots, pocketing the knife. He folds his hands on the table and stares expectantly.\nIt\u2019s hard to tell what kind of mood Wade might be in today. \u201cDo you, um\u2026 Mind if I join you?\u201d Peter stumbles over the sentence, feeling awkward and unsure. Two things he\u2019s never really experienced around Wade before, at least not to this degree.\nWade shrugs.\nPeter huffs. \u201cAlright, what\u2019s wrong? Why are you giving me the silent treatment?\u201d He\u2019d hoped that after so much time they would be past this but that was probably a silly hope. Things don\u2019t just mend themselves if you leave them alone. They\u2019d parted on okay terms, though, hadn\u2019t they? Hadn\u2019t they already been on the road to fixing this the last time they\u2019d seen each other? It had seemed that way, what with Wade\u2019s continued flirting.\n\u201cMe? Silent treatment? Buddy, I wouldn\u2019t even know how.\u201d\nThe waitress seems hesitant to approach but she does, notepad in hand, to take Spider-Man\u2019s order. Peter just asks for a coffee. He\u2019s not hungry but it would be rude not to order anything.\n\u201cThen why\u2019d you fall off the map?\u201d Peter asks as soon as she\u2019s out of earshot, picking their conversation back up.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been around. Took a couple of jobs but otherwise, I\u2019ve been right here in the city. Didn\u2019t realize you wanted to keep tabs on me. Is that a condition, too? I can\u2019t stay here unless I tell you every little thing I do?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 not what I meant. I just- normally I see you and-\u201c Peter stops. This isn\u2019t at all how he meant for this conversation to go. He tries again, decides to be blatant in the hopes that Wade will appreciate his honesty. \u201cI missed you, that\u2019s all.\u201d It shocks him, realizing as he says it just how much he means it. He has missed Wade, in all his manic, mouthy glory. He makes Peter laugh and he\u2019s silly and capable and, at times, insightful and Peter is almost always having fun when he\u2019s around.\nWade fidgets with the hem of his sleeve, which is so long it falls over his knuckles. \u201cBut not too much, right? You\u2019ve got my number- why didn\u2019t you call? Why didn\u2019t you go looking? Why do I have to do all the work?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026 What?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a two-way street. Or it should be. I don\u2019t wanna always be the one hounding you, you know? And I kept thinking- oh, he\u2019ll call. He\u2019ll shoot me a message or stop by the apartment. But you never did. So then I started thinking I would call, or find you, but no. I wanted to see how long you\u2019d go before you noticed. I wanted to see if you\u2019d vanish once you didn\u2019t owe me anymore.\u201d\nPeter opens his mouth, closes it again. He hadn\u2019t thought about it in those terms at all. He\u2019d assumed that if Wade wasn\u2019t contacting him then he didn\u2019t want to be contacted.\n\u201cJust tell me,\u201d Wade says, leaning forward, elbows propped on the table. \u201cDid I completely fuck things up in Colorado? I mean, I know I fucked things up- what else is new- but, like, on a scale of one to ten-\u201c\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t avoiding you because of Colorado. I wasn\u2019t avoiding you at all. I thought- I thought you wanted space or something. Or that you were done with me or\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDone with you?\u201d There\u2019s a pause, and then Wade laughs. \u201cOh, my god. Spider-Man is insecure? Holy shit, that\u2019s adorable.\u201d\nPeter didn\u2019t know he was waiting to hear Wade\u2019s laugh but as soon as he does some of the tension drains from him, like something in him just needed to hear that sound to be put at ease.\n\u201cAs if I could ever be done with you. Fucking hell, Spidey. Have you seen yourself? Do you know who you are?\u201d He drums his fingers on the tabletop. \u201cSo we were both just being insecure assholes? That\u2019s my gig. You heroes are supposed to have all the swagger, all the confidence. I didn\u2019t even think you might be over there moping, thinking I dumped you, because why the hell would you? Look at me. Or, you know. Don\u2019t. Point being, you\u2019re stupid and I forgive you.\u201d\nPeter blinks. \u201c\u2026Thanks?\u201d he ventures. \u201cUh. So we\u2019re good now?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting there.\u201d Wade pauses again. His fingers keep tapping. \u201cYou really missed me?\u201d\nPeter ducks his chin. No point in being shy about it now. \u201cYes.\u201d\nWade giggles. Actually giggles. Peter wouldn\u2019t say he\u2019s used to Wade\u2019s mood swings but he\u2019s not totally unfamiliar, either, and in this case, he\u2019s glad for it. It helps that he feels partly responsible for cheering him up. It\u2019s a good feeling.\nWade reaches out, pokes Peter on the nose, and says, \u201cBoop.\u201d\nPeter catches his hand before he can retract it. He holds it there, lines their fingers up. Peter\u2019s are long and thin, like an artist\u2019s, and dwarfed by Wade\u2019s, who has the hands of a fighter. His scars only further that impression.\n\u201cDo they hurt?\u201d Peter asks.\n\u201cAll the time,\u201d Wade replies.\nPeter lets go when their waitress approaches their table with Peter\u2019s coffee and Wade\u2019s meal. Peter thanks her, Wade ignores her. As soon as she walks away, Wade hooks his feet around Peter\u2019s ankles under the table. Peter lets him.\nPeter pushes his mask up to sip at his coffee. Out of the corner of his eye, Peter notes the waitress staring. Maybe trying to figure out if he knows him.\nWade fiddles with his silverware.\n\u201cI can go,\u201d Peter offers gently.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Wade says with no hesitation. \u201cStay. I\u2019ll eat later.\u201d\nPeter wants to tell him he\u2019s being ridiculous, wants to tell him that he won\u2019t be scared off no matter what Wade looks like under that mask, but it all sounds so serious, so presumptuous, in his head. He leaves it all unsaid. Instead, he just says, \u201cOkay,\u201d and he stays.\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna have to talk about it eventually, aren\u2019t we? The whole\u2026 difference of opinion thing.\u201d\n\u201cEventually,\u201d Peter agrees. \u201cBut not tonight.\u201d\n-\nPeter texts Wade the next day while he\u2019s at work. He doesn\u2019t intend to make the same mistake twice.\nWade texts back in record time. Peter figures he just needed a little encouragement because after that it\u2019s as though the flood gates have opened. Wade texts him throughout the day and into the night. Random things, random pictures, all in the interest of making Peter laugh. If people catch Peter smiling dopily at his phone- well. He lets them.\nAunt May is staring at him.\nPeter flips his phone shut. \u201cWhat?\u201d\nHer smile is small and knowing. \u201cWho\u2019s that you\u2019re texting, dear?\u201d she asks faux-innocently.\n\u201cNo one,\u201d is Peter\u2019s reflexive answer, which he realizes after the fact is more suspicious than just saying \u2018a friend\u2019 or even just saying \u2018Wade\u2019.\nAunt May takes a very pointed bite of her mashed potatoes. She hums, looking far too conniving for her own good. \u201cNo one? So you won\u2019t mind if I set you up with Nora\u2019s daughter? She\u2019s a sweet little thing, already agreed to the date. All I had to do was show her your picture.\u201d She takes another bite, letting Peter stew in silence for a moment. \u201cOr, if not her, there\u2019s this new girl who just moved in a few houses down, I hear she\u2019s single- Or, oh, this nice boy at the supermarket! His name was Evan, I think. He was very handsome-\u201c\n\u201cNo,\u201d Peter groans, finally interrupting. \u201cAbsolutely not. No one is setting me up with anyone. Ever. I don\u2019t need to be set up, Aunt May. I\u2019m perfectly happy with- with-\u201c\nAunt May\u2019s eyebrows are somewhere around her hairline. \u201cWith who?\u201d she presses.\nPeter had been going to say with the single life. Instead, he says, \u201cWith\u2026 Wade\u2026\u201d It comes out sounding weak and unsure, the lie already tasting bitter on his tongue. He wishes he could take it back as soon as it leaves his lips. Dishonesty has never been something he\u2019s very comfortable with.\nIf Aunt May notices anything amiss then she doesn\u2019t point it out. Instead, she claps, which Peter feels is rather uncalled for. \u201cOh, I knew it! You haven\u2019t stopped smiling at that phone since you walked in. Tell me all about him, Peter!\u201d\nPeter bites his lip. It\u2019s too late now, he decides, and tries to recall everything about Wade that might earn his Aunt's approval. \u201cHe\u2019s\u2026 very outgoing. And funny. Kind of\u2026 out there, sometimes, but it keeps things interesting. He can be\u2026 surprisingly sweet, though. And he\u2019s insecure, a little bit, about his looks, but-\u201c\n\u201cBut looks aren\u2019t everything,\u201d Aunt May finishes for him, grinning from ear to ear. \u201cHe sounds lovely. Do you have a picture? When can I meet him?\u201d\nPeter groans again. \u201cIt\u2019s still new, Aunt May! I can\u2019t just spring you on him. And no, no pictures. We haven\u2019t reached the \u2018selfie together\u2019 stage yet. Give it time, okay?\u201d\nShe reaches out to pat his hand, still looking inordinately pleased. \u201cHave you told MJ? You have to tell MJ.\u201d\nPeter sighs. Wade, he thinks, must never, ever find out about this.\n-\n\n\nwhere r u? it\u2019s chimichanga time\n\n\n\nWhat is it with you and Mexican food?\n\n\nI\u2019m on my way home. Were we supposed to meet up today? No one told me.\n\nPeter pockets the phone. He shoves his camera and portfolio into his bag, then shoulders the burden. He\u2019s the only one left in the office so there isn\u2019t anyone to wish him goodnight. He\u2019d stayed late today to finish up some editing and procrastinate an essay and now it\u2019s dark out and he\u2019s so hungry his stomach is actually growling, which is how he knows it\u2019s reached critical levels. Just the thought of chimichangas is kind of making his mouth water and he doesn\u2019t even like Mexican food that much.\nHis phone buzzes again as he\u2019s stepping out onto the sidewalk.\n\n\nu were just supposed to KNOW. like a fuckin mind reader\n\n\n\nI\u2019m Spider-Man, not Professor X. Where should I be and when?\n\n\n\nmy place. headed there now. race ya!\n\n\n\nNot fair! I don\u2019t have my web shooters.\n\nPeter is only barely paying attention to his surroundings as he texts. It\u2019s only thanks to his spider-sense that he avoids a head-on collision with another pedestrian and they still somehow manage to knock shoulders.\n\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d Peter apologizes on reflex. \u201cAre you-\u201c He stops. \u201cOh,\u201d he says. \u201cHi.\u201d\nWade is decked out in all his gear today, weapons included, but it doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s been in a fight. There\u2019s no blood or telltale rips in his suit. He looks up from his phone. His Spider-Man phone, to which Peter is currently holding the twin. \u201cPeter Parker? Damn. I\u2019m starting to think it really is fate. What are the odds, right?\u201d\nPeter laughs, nervous and strained. He tries to surreptitiously slide the phone back into his pocket. He can tell he fails on the surreptitious part by the way Wade tilts his head, very obviously tracking the movement. Wade\u2019s thumb is hovering over his keypad. No doubt he was replying to Peter\u2019s last message. \u201cRight!\u201d Peter chirps, probably just this side of too cheery. Internally, he curses his luck. Of all the times to run into Wade out of costume\u2026\nThere\u2019s a pause. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re wearing a fucking sweater vest,\u201d Wade says, which is enough of a tangent that Peter starts to relax. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of amazing.\u201d\nPeter laughs again, tugs self-consciously at the hem of said sweater vest. \u201cUm, thanks. I like your\u2026 thigh holster.\u201d\nWade snickers. \u201cI bet you do,\u201d he says. \u201cHang on, just gotta finish this text to Spider-Man. Who I\u2019m super tight with, by the way. Just saying. Feel free to be impressed.\u201d\nPeter rolls his eyes. A moment later, Wade hits send, and Peter\u2019s phone chimes, obnoxiously loud in the otherwise relatively quiet night. Peter doesn\u2019t move, just internally berates himself for not putting it on silent like a freaking moron. \nWade looks at him, then at his pocket. \u201cHuh,\u201d he says. \u201cYou gonna check that?\u201d\n\u201cNope!\u201d Peter says, suddenly feeling very hot under the collar. There\u2019s no way he could explain away the phone. Especially not with the obnoxious (and yet somehow endearing) Deadpool sticker on the back. It would be too much of a coincidence. \u201cIt\u2019s- probably nothing. Don\u2019t worry about it. So, where were you headed-\u201c\n\u201cHang on,\u201d Wade interrupts. He presses a few more buttons on his phone. Peter\u2019s pocket chimes once again. \u201cI really think you should look at that,\u201d Wade urges, sounding amused. \u201cSounds like it might be important. Could be your girlfriend.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t have one of those.\u201d\n\u201cBoyfriend?\u201d\nPeter shakes his head.\n\u201cHm,\u201d Wade says. \u201cInteresting.\u201d\nPeter opens his mouth, not at all sure what\u2019s going to come out. In the end, nothing does. They\u2019re interrupted by a man in a black beanie with a beard in desperate need of a trim. At first, it seems like he\u2019ll pass them by but then he stops, just out of Wade\u2019s arms reach. \u201cYou,\u201d he says. His voice is gruff. It's the kind of voice one only acquires after years of smoking cigarettes. \u201cYou Wade Wilson?\u201d\nThe change in Wade is subtle but Peter picks up on it. His posture shifts as he goes on high alert. He keeps the phone clutched in one hand, moves the other to the holster at his side. He stops just short of drawing his gun. With one more small shift, he\u2019s placed himself mostly in front of Peter. Preparing to protect him. \u201cYeah. You a fan?\u201d\n\u201cSomething like that,\u201d says the man, smirking.\nPeter sees Wade look around, figures he\u2019s probably checking to make sure no one else is nearby to get caught in any crossfire. The sidewalk is otherwise empty, excepting the three of them, which is normal for this time of night. Peter knows, he\u2019s walked this route enough times. Normally he appreciates that the Bugle is out of the way but right now the relative seclusion and darkened street lend an ominous air.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Wade says, tone still light. \u201cI\u2019m in the middle of something, so if you could kindly fuck off-\u201c\nThe man draws and fires in the span of an eye blink. Wade\u2019s head snaps back, neck at an unnatural angle. Red spatters the sidewalk behind him. He falls, crumbles to the ground in a heap of boneless, lifeless limbs.\nPeter stumbles backward to avoid going down with him. He stares, uncomprehending. Wade isn\u2019t getting up. He isn\u2019t moving. The back of his head is a mess of blood- darker in color than his suit- and brain matter. Logically Peter knows that people don\u2019t just survive getting shot in the head, not like that, but he still finds himself holding his breath. Hoping. He knows Wade has a healing factor. Can it bring him back from something like this? It can regrow limbs but can it knit his brain back together?\nHe barely registers the man fleeing until he\u2019s already half a block gone. Peter runs after him anyway, loathe to leave Wade\u2019s side but unwilling to let the man escape. He doesn\u2019t have his web-shooters but he\u2019s far from helpless and he\u2019s already closed most of the distance between them when a sleek black car screeches to a halt beside the curb. The windows are tinted so dark they show nothing but the reflection of city lights. The door swings open and the man clambers in, just seconds before Peter can grab him. Instead, Peter\u2019s fingers close on empty air, and the car screeches away again.\nPeter can still see Wade when he turns around. From this distance, he\u2019s just a smear of red on the pavement. Still unmoving. Still silent.\nHe doesn\u2019t know what to do. He doesn\u2019t know what to do, so he goes back. His mind is a mess of random observations and half-formed plans and panicked questions. Things like, what do I do with the body? And, there\u2019s blood on my shoe. And even, I never saw his face.\nHe kneels next to the body. Because that\u2019s what it is, isn\u2019t it? A body. It\u2019s a weird realization to have. Peter feels numb.\nWith shaking hands, he pulls out his phone. The phone.\nThe last two messages Wade sent him were:\n\n\nthat\u2019s what makes it fair\n\n\n\n\n;)\n\n\nPeter laughs because it\u2019s either that or cry. He puts the phone back in his pocket, thinks idly that there\u2019s no use for it now. He touches the back of Wade\u2019s hand where it rests on the concrete.\nWade\u2019s finger twitches.\nPeter jumps, scurries backward. Wade\u2019s finger twitches again, and then his hand moves, and then he\u2019s lifting it to his forehead and groaning. \u201cFucking hell,\u201d he mutters, slowly rearranging his limbs and sitting up. \u201cThat always fucking hurts and it never fucking kills me so why do they keep trying?\u201d\nThere\u2019s still blood dripping from his head down the back of his suit. Peter watches it with wide eyes.\nWade finally seems to realize he\u2019s got company. \u201cOh,\u201d he says. \u201cSorry about that. Were you- uh. You look a little pale. You alright, Petey? Get a little sick at the sight of blood?\u201d\n\u201cMe?\u201d Peter says, finding his voice. \u201cMe? Am I alright? Wade- I just watched a man kill you.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, and?\u201d\nPeter sputters incoherently, waving his hands.\n\u201cYou said you\u2019d heard of me, right? Figured you\u2019d know all about the ol\u2019 healing factor. Kinda what makes me super, after all.\u201d Wade wipes at his wound with the back of one hand, smearing blood in an attempt to clear it away. \u201cUgh, gross,\u201d he says to himself. \u201cAnother suit for the dumpster.\u201d He takes the dirty glove off and flings it away.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know you could come back from the dead!\u201d\n\u201cOh, sure.\u201d Wade stands, brushes himself off. Some poor sap, Peter thinks, is going to walk by this bloodstain and be very confused later. \u201cI can\u2019t be killed. And trust me, people have tried.\u201d\nPeter stands, too, just so Wade isn\u2019t looking down at him. \u201cI thought- I was in full-on freak out mode, okay? Don\u2019t just act like this is nothing. I thought you were dead. I ran after the guy! I was gonna punch him in the face for you!\u201d He shoves Wade- lightly, but maybe Wade is still dizzy because he sways with it and grabs onto Peter for balance, fingers curled around Peter\u2019s arms. He doesn't let go.\n\u201cAw, you were gonna punch a guy for me? That\u2019s sweet. But dangerous. You should leave that to the professionals, kiddo. I\u2019d hate to deprive the world of your pretty face.\u201d\n\u201cProfessionals like you? Professionals who get shot in the head by some jerk in a beanie? Who was that guy, anyway?\u201d\n\u201cProbably a member of the drug cartel I pissed off last time I was out of town. He did look like a jerk, didn\u2019t he? Should\u2019ve seen it coming a mile away.\u201d\n\u201cThat is not the point.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you want to me say, dear. I\u2019m sorry you had to witness that? I\u2019m sorry I got blood on your shoe? I\u2019m sorry we keep running into each other?\u201d\n\u201cNo- don\u2019t be sorry for that.\u201d Being around Wade out of costume is weirdly freeing. Peter thinks it should probably be the other way around. \u201cI\u2019m not sorry about that.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Good,\u201d Wade says after a beat. He clears his throat, steps away. Then perks up again. \u201cOh, shit. I was supposed to meet Spider-Man. How much time did I lose?\u201d\nPeter checks his watch, feeling a little miffed by Wade\u2019s sudden awkwardness. \u201cFifteen minutes.\u201d\nHe groans. \u201cGreat. Gotta go, Petey! Be careful on the way home!\u201d He blows a kiss as he starts jogging away.\nPeter thinks it\u2019s lucky he isn\u2019t just some normal pedestrian. Otherwise, he\u2019d probably need therapy.\n-\n\u201cSo what happened?\u201d\nPeter is calm now. Calmer than he was twenty minutes ago, anyway. He can\u2019t seem to stop replaying the incident in his head- alive now or not, he witnessed Wade dying and he was devastated and he knows eventually those are feelings he\u2019s going to have to deal with- but otherwise, he\u2019s fine. He\u2019d swung by one of his secret stashes to grab his suit and managed to arrive at Wade\u2019s place just moments after the mercenary himself.\nWade looks over from where he's prodding gingerly at his skull in a mirror. He still hasn\u2019t changed his clothes. \u201cOh, nothing. Just a shooting. But don\u2019t worry- I\u2019ll handle it. I\u2019m thinking the guy responsible will make a nice kebab, skewered just so.\u201d He draws his katanas as if to demonstrate, but then just tosses them aside. They land gently in the armchair.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll kill him?\u201d\n\u201cSure. An eye for an eye and all that.\u201d\nPeter shakes his head. He wants to argue. The words are on the tip of his tongue. Instead, he closes the distance between them and folds Wade into an embrace. Peter isn\u2019t very physically affectionate by nature but- this is what he needs. Right now, he craves the affection like he so rarely does. Maybe because he thought he lost Wade, or maybe it\u2019s just been too long.\nWade always, always seems surprised when Peter touches him in a non-hostile way. This is no exception but he recovers quicker than ever before, pulling Peter to him with strong arms. \u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d he says, voice soft, as though Peter's concern is silly.\n\u201cI know,\u201d Peter says. Then, \u201cYou smell bad.\u201d\n\u201cWell if someone wasn\u2019t being clingy then I could go shower.\u201d\nNeither of them moves.\n\u201cI think,\u201d Peter says finally, hooking his chin over Wade\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThat I was promised chimichangas.\u201d\n\u201cThat you were. But now I\u2019m thinking we have Chinese delivered, park our asses on the couch, and watch movies until we pass out. All in favor say aye.\u201d\nPeter didn\u2019t really come prepared for an impromptu sleepover and he has a test tomorrow and he\u2019s not at all fond of sleeping in his suit but- \u201cAye. Sounds great.\u201d\nWade falls asleep before Peter does, head resting on Peter\u2019s lap. Peter struggles to stay awake during his test but still regrets nothing.\nPeter should be studying. Instead, he\u2019s perched on a rooftop, waiting for Wade to arrive and marveling at how predictable he\u2019s become. Not that he\u2019s all that sad about it. Spending time with Wade will always trump sitting alone in a library, nose stuffed in a book for the sake of a grade. Besides, it\u2019s a beautiful day. Even Aunt May wouldn\u2019t fault him for taking a little time off. Probably.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll never guess where I\u2019ve been,\u201d Wade says, announcing his presence. He\u2019s only a silhouette against the setting sun until he draws near.\nPeter tilts his head. \u201c\u2026 Albania?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? No.\u201d Wade plops down beside him with none of his usual grace. He thrusts a white paper bag in Peter\u2019s general direction. \u201cHere\u2019s your fucking chocolate chip ice cream, you nerd.\u201d\nPeter takes the bag, peers inside. Wade wasn\u2019t bluffing. There is indeed a small bowl of chocolate chip ice cream sitting inside, along with a bright pink spoon. Peter fishes them out, excited. \u201cYou can\u2019t call me a nerd while you\u2019re doing something nice for me. It\u2019s just confusing.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a term of endearment.\u201d Wade waves a dismissive hand. Agitation is radiating off of him like heat. He\u2019s talking faster than normal. \u201cAnyway. I\u2019ve been at the Avenger\u2019s HQ all day. And do you know why?\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Peter asks around a mouthful of ice cream.\n\u201cBecause of you.\u201d\nPeter licks his spoon clean and calmly waits for elaboration.\n\u201cYes, you,\u201d Wade says, as though he\u2019d asked. \u201cWhen I first got the call I thought- hey, guess they need some fucking dirty work done. Cause that\u2019s what they do, you know. They call me in when some shit needs doing that they won\u2019t deign to do themselves. Which is fine. It\u2019s whatever. But today they just wanted to talk. About you.\u201d Wade is gesturing a lot, talking with his hands. He seems too riled up to sit still.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know you worked with the Avengers sometimes,\u201d Peter muses. \u201cActually I kinda thought they had you blacklisted or something.\u201d\n\u201cEh,\u201d Wade says. \u201cMore like for. I work for them sometimes. But that\u2019s beside the point. The point is- they wanted to know my intentions. I\u2019m pretty sure they think I\u2019m going to murder you. Or\u2026 infect you with my crazy? Somehow? I don\u2019t really know, they weren\u2019t super clear on that front. You\u2019re not one of them, right? You said you weren\u2019t one of them.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Peter assures him. \u201cWe\u2019ve helped each other out before, I guess, but I\u2019ve never been officially added to the roster. What did they say, exactly?\u201d\nWade hunches his shoulders, curling in on himself. \u201cThey made some\u2026 insinuations. Called me a bad influence and basically told me to stay the fuck away from you because I\u2019m- Well, whatever. I told them to go fuck themselves. I hear that shit from myself every day, I don\u2019t need to hear it from them, too.\u201d\nPeter takes another bite of ice cream, this one contemplative. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to them,\u201d he decides.\nWade shakes his head. \u201cDon\u2019t do that. They\u2019re just looking out for you. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re wrong-\u201c\n\u201cThey are wrong,\u201d Peter snaps, though his ire isn\u2019t directed at Wade and he hopes Wade knows it. \u201cThey\u2019ve got no right to talk to you like that. You\u2019re my friend and if I want to spend time with you, I will, the Avengers be damned.\u201d\nWade stares. Peter pauses with his spoon in mid-air. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s hot,\u201d Wade declares. \u201cYou going all protective boyfriend on me. I like it.\u201d\nBoyfriend. Peter blushes. \u201cI\u2026 I wasn\u2019t-\u201c\n\u201cBut,\u201d Wade interrupts. \u201cThere\u2019s a better way to get our point across.\u201d He rubs his hands together and performs his best villain laugh, which is quite good since the two of them hear them so often. It\u2019s almost scarily accurate, even. \u201cLet\u2019s roll their front yard.\u201d\nPeter mentally translates that into English. \u201cYou want to\u2026 Cover Avengers Tower in toilet paper\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Wade practically hisses. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect.\u201d\nPeter shrugs. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m in.\u201d\nWade cheers, throws his fist into the air. \u201cYay! Now, we\u2019re going to need a lot of toilet paper\u2026\u201d\n-\nIt\u2019s MJ who brings it to Peter\u2019s attention.\nThe two of them are grabbing a post-lunch coffee when she finally broaches the topic of Wade, Peter\u2019s mysterious new boyfriend, which Peter knows she\u2019s been dying to ask about all along. He\u2019s rather impressed with her restraint, actually, and tells her so, but once the floodgates have opened she drowns him in questions. She\u2019s not kidding when she says she wants to know everything. She asks about Wade\u2019s favorite color and what he does for a living and how they met- all questions Peter either knows or can bullshit an answer for. Then she starts digging deeper. She wants to know where Wade grew up, are his parents still around, what are his hobbies, who are his friends, how old is he, etc. It's as she\u2019s asking that Peter realizes he has no idea.\nHe almost immediately determines to remedy that. This is why, when Wade invites him over for movies- something that is quickly becoming a happy routine- he leaps at the opportunity to learn a little bit more about the mercenary.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Peter says, attempting casual and falling just short. They are now halfway into an old black and white detective movie. They\u2019re camped out on the couch, sitting close enough that their thighs are pressed together even though it\u2019s probably big enough for four people to sit comfortably side by side. \u201cI was thinking and I realized, I know you, but I don\u2019t know a lot about you.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Wade says slowly, instantly wary. He turns the TV down. Peter has his full attention. \u201cWhat do you wanna know?\u201d\n\u201cI guess I just\u2026 wondered about your past, mostly. Pre-Weapon X.\u201d\nWade starts to tap his fingers on his own knee. \u201cWhat about it?\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t Peter\u2019s intention to make him nervous but he presses on, choosing his words carefully, keeping his tone light and inquisitive. \u201cJust, where are you from? What did you do before? That kind of thing.\u201d\nWade\u2019s tapping speeds up. \u201cWhy are you asking? I mean, are you asking because you want me to tell you I was a saint before Weapon X? That I was some average joe vanilla good guy? Because Weapon X fucked me up, Spidey, but I was already pretty fucked up to begin with, so I hate to disappoint you, but-\u201c\n\u201cNo, no.\u201d Peter places his hand atop Wade\u2019s, stilling it. \u201cI\u2019m just curious, Wade. No ulterior motive. I promise.\u201d\nAfter a moment, Wade nods. \u201cAlright. Well\u2026 Never got along with my parents, to say the least. Got out of there as soon as I could. Career-wise, I\u2019ve always been a killer. It\u2019s what I\u2019m good at. I was Special Forces for a while but I didn\u2019t like some of the orders they were handing down so I went into business for myself. Became a mercenary. Started picking my own jobs.\u201d\nPeter nods, silently encouraging him to go on.\n\u201cThen\u2026 I met a girl. Fell in love with said girl. Got cancer. Left the girl. Volunteered for Weapon X. Continued muddling my way through life and now here I am, the scarred shell of a man you see before you.\u201d Wade laughs, bitter and more than a little self-deprecating. It tugs at Peter\u2019s heartstrings. \u201cI was a real looker back then, Spidey, like holy shit. It was a face even you could\u2019ve loved-\u201c\nPeter rests his fingers on Wade\u2019s jawline, just lightly. Wade stops talking. The two of them are sitting even closer now, somehow. Peter notices and doesn\u2019t care to change it. \u201cDo you know why I want to see your face so bad, Wade?\u201d\nWade swallows. He shakes his head.\n\u201cBecause I want to know you. Really and truly. And I feel like I can\u2019t- not until I can look in your eyes.\u201d\nFor a beat, Wade says nothing. He touches Peter\u2019s throat, right where Peter knows the line of his mask ends. \u201cThat works both ways. I\u2019ll show you mine if you show me yours.\u201d\nPeter\u2019s heart is beating harder and faster than he\u2019d like to admit. He\u2019s never revealed his identity, never taken his mask off- not for anyone. But, \u201cI don\u2019t think you need me to take the mask off. I think you know exactly who I am.\u201d His voice is shaking. He can\u2019t help it. If he\u2019s wrong- well. He hopes he isn\u2019t wrong. He really hopes he can trust Wade with this. If not, the consequences are too daunting to think about. \u201cYou\u2019re smarter than a lot of people give you credit for, Wade. You can\u2019t honestly tell me you haven\u2019t guessed by now.\u201d\n\u201cDo it anyway,\u201d Wade urges, voice low. \u201cFor me. Please.\u201d\nPeter takes a deep breath. He pushes his mask up to his nose, pauses. There\u2019s no going back after this. There\u2019s no putting the secret back in the box. Peter doesn\u2019t think Wade will give him cause to wish he could. In fact, he's counting on it.\nHe can\u2019t look at Wade once the mask is removed. He holds it in his hands, stares at it in lieu of making eye contact, even though he knows he wouldn\u2019t be able to see Wade\u2019s expression anyway. The mask stares back at him, so utterly familiar.\nFor a long time, Wade says nothing. Then, \u201cPeter,\u201d he breathes, warm and relieved. His gloveless fingers graze Peter\u2019s cheekbones, his nose, the edge of his bottom lip. Peter looks up, finally, and though Wade\u2019s face is still covered he\u2019d like to think he\u2019s smiling. \u201cI knew it was you. I wanted it to be you.\u201d\n\u201cYou did?\u201d\nWade nods. \u201cFate, Peter, what did I tell you? You\u2019re\u2026 amazing. You\u2019re perfect and I didn\u2019t wanna have to choose and can we just ignore all the stupid things I said before I knew it was you, please? Cause I\u2019m pretty sure I said some really stupid things-\u201c\n\u201cIt was\u2026 nice,\u201d Peter argues. He\u2019s blushing and Wade is looking at him. Wade is looking at him with the knowledge that Peter is also Spider-Man and it\u2019s a strange, heady sort of feeling. It\u2019s freeing, in a way, but also terrifying because now there\u2019s nothing for Peter to hide behind. He feels laid bare. \u201cWhen did you figure it out?\u201d\n\u201cI started suspecting in the supermarket. Something about you was ringing some bells. But I thought I was crazy for thinking it. I mean, what are the odds, right? But I knew I was onto something the other night, with the phones, which by the way was so stupid of you, it\u2019s amazing you\u2019ve managed to keep it a secret this long.\u201d\n\u201cHey! In my defense, I wasn\u2019t exactly expecting you to show up when you did.\u201d Peter ducks his chin, pouting. \u201cDon\u2019t think you\u2019re getting out of your end of the bargain by distracting me with insults.\u201d\n\u201cLoving insults,\u201d Wade corrects. He sighs. \u201cAre you sure about this?\u201d\n\u201cBeyond sure.\u201d\nWade reaches up, then stops.\nPeter gently places his hands on Wade\u2019s mask. \u201cLet me?\u201d he asks.\nWade lowers his own hands, nods once.\nWhen Peter slips the mask off, Wade\u2019s eyes are closed. He keeps them that way as Peter takes in the details of his face. His scars, which match those covering the rest of his body. His lips, one of which he holds between his teeth. The curve of his cheekbones, the line of his jaw, the slope of his nose. All familiar and yet brand new. Peter could look at him for hours, for years, and not be bored.\n\u201cWade,\u201d he says softly. \u201cLook at me.\u201d\nWade acquiesces. The first thing that strikes Peter is how expressive his eyes are. They somehow manage to convey so many things at once. Fear and hope and resignation and hurt. They\u2019re beautiful and oh-so-very Wade and Peter was right- his imagination could never have done Wade justice. The two of them are looking each other in the eye for the first time and Peter has so much fondness for this man he can barely contain it all. He feels likes he\u2019s going to explode if he doesn\u2019t do something.\n\u201cWade,\u201d Peter says again. \u201cI\u2019m going to kiss you now. Okay?\u201d\nWhatever Wade was expecting, it evidently wasn\u2019t that. His eyes go wide, he begins to form a surprised question, but Peter doesn\u2019t give him time to voice it or himself time to doubt. He closes the distance between them, presses their lips together as gently as he knows how. Wade melts into it in an instant, hands coming up to frame Peter\u2019s face, to hold him there. He smells of gunpowder and something else, something distinctly Wade that Peter has grown to love.\n\u201cI tried,\u201d Peter says when they separate. Neither of them goes very far. \u201cTo pretend that this was something else. But the other night- I had a terrible day and I was exhausted and angry and all I wanted to do was be with you. Near you. That\u2019s all I wanted and I knew then that I was fooling myself-\u201c\n\u201cAm I dreaming?\u201d Wade wonders. \u201cIs it April Fools?\u201d\nPeter laughs, just this side of breathless. \u201cNo, this is real. I mean it. Every word. Did you really think your scars would scare me off? They\u2019re just\u2026 you, Wade. They\u2019re part of you and I like them.\u201d He traces one with his thumb, follows it over Wade\u2019s brow bone. \u201cThey tell a story. Your story.\u201d\nWade kisses him like he can\u2019t help it. It\u2019s chaste and light and neither of them pushes for more. There\u2019s still so much mystery between them, so many questions that need to be asked and talks that need to be had. \u201cWhatever you do,\u201d Wade says seriously. \u201cDon\u2019t pinch me.\u201d\nPeter laughs and kisses him again.\n-\nPeter\u2019s life is never simple. He accepted that it never would be when he decided to become Spider-Man, which is why he\u2019s only mildly surprised to find Black Widow waiting for him not far from Wade\u2019s apartment. She\u2019s leaning casually against a lamppost, red hair catching the light.\nPeter stops well out of arms reach. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he asks, wary and irritated all at once. He still hasn\u2019t forgiven the Avengers for talking down to someone he cares about and he highly doubts she\u2019s here to apologize. He and Wade never did get around to rolling their yard, more\u2019s the pity.\n\u201cDelivery,\u201d she says, extending a thin white packet. He doesn\u2019t like the look on her face. Her expression is a perfectly blank mask. \u201cWe just thought it might be prudent to show you who you\u2019re really making friends with.\u201d\n\u201cKeep it. Whatever you've got in there, whatever you think you\u2019ve got on Wade, I don\u2019t need to see it. I know exactly who I\u2019m making friends with, thanks.\u201d He goes to move past her but she stops him with a hand on his shoulder.\n\u201cJust take it,\u201d she urges. \u201cYou don\u2019t even have to open it. Just take it off my hands and I can say my job is done.\u201d\nAfter a pause, Peter does as she asks. She\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have to open it.\n\u201cFor what it\u2019s worth,\u201d she adds, and something seeps through the mask. Pity? \u201cI think you\u2019re going to want to see what\u2019s in there.\u201d\nPeter shrugs her hand off his shoulder. For some reason, he feels like he\u2019s lost some kind of game he didn\u2019t know he was playing with her.\nWhen he gets home, he throws the packet onto his desk, intending to ignore it. He showers and eats and goes to bed.\nBut, just as Black Widow undoubtedly intended, he can\u2019t stop wondering.\nIt\u2019s not that Peter is opposed to Wade showing up at his place of employment, it\u2019s just that he\u2019s not expecting it. This is why, when the murmuring starts up, he doesn\u2019t initially pay attention. Then the distressed, curious, and amused mumbling of his coworkers grows louder, draws nearer to him- and then Wade throws his arm around Peter\u2019s shoulders and he nearly jumps out of his skin.\n\u201cMorning, sunshine,\u201d Wade singsongs. \u201cOr should I say afternoon? The day kinda got away from me, what with all the napping I did.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Peter blurts. Wade is wearing his mask, because of course he is. Peter had kind of hoped that after the initial reveal he might forgo it but now that seems like a silly hope. Wade wasn\u2019t wearing the mask just for Peter\u2019s supposed benefit and he won\u2019t stop now just because Peter didn\u2019t run for the hills the first time he got a look at him.\n\u201cBringing you donuts,\u201d Wade tells him, brandishing a small white box. \u201cThese are absolutely the best donuts in the entire city and I can say that for a fact because I\u2019ve been to every single donut shop since I\u2019ve been in town. It took a while but I knew I couldn\u2019t really think of New York as home until I\u2019d figured out the best place to get donuts, you know?\u201d\n\u201cUm,\u201d says Peter. He takes the box. \u201cThank you.\u201d He looks around, unsubtly scanning the room and its other occupants. No one will quite meet his eye, but when he looks away he can feel them staring. \u201cMaybe we should\u2026 talk outside?\u201d he suggests, even as he leans further into Wade\u2019s side.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Wade asks. His grip on Peter tightens, almost to the point of being uncomfortable. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re embarrassed to be seen with me, Petey.\u201d\nPeter places the donuts on his desk- he\u2019ll definitely be back for those- and wiggles his way out of Wade\u2019s hold. \u201cNope,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are definitely talking outside. Elevator, go.\u201d\nWhen Wade doesn\u2019t immediately follow instructions, Peter takes his sleeve and starts pulling him in the right direction. At first, Wade digs his heels in, refusing to be moved, but Peter's strength is something to be reckoned with and after a moment he lets up and reluctantly trudges along. He links their arms when Peter drops his sleeve. Now that he\u2019s been given tacit permission to touch Peter, he doesn\u2019t seem to want to stop. Peter isn't complaining.\nDespite saying they should talk outside, Peter starts up as soon as they\u2019re in the empty elevator. \u201cWhy\u2019d you really come here today? Huh? Cause I know you\u2019re not just here to deliver donuts.\u201d\n\u201cI just wanted to see you,\u201d Wade says, pout audible. He winds his arms around Peter, pulling the two of them together. As close as they are, Peter has to tilt his chin up to look Wade in the eye. He\u2019d have to go up on his tip-toes just slightly to kiss him and-\nThat\u2019s beside the point. Peter shakes his head at himself. \u201cI\u2019m- glad. But I still don\u2019t think that\u2019s the only reason.\u201d\n\u201cI just wanted to see if things were different now.\u201d\nWade is being very distracting. Peter isn\u2019t sure it\u2019s intentional. His thumbs are rubbing small circles into Peter\u2019s skin and he\u2019s talking very low and standing so close. \u201cOf course, things are different now,\u201d Peter says, struggling to hold onto his train of thought. He really wishes Wade wasn\u2019t wearing the mask. \u201cHow could they not be?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I mean- bad different. Like you changed your mind different. Like you came to your senses different. You get me?\u201d\n\u201cClearly,\u201d Peter tells him, linking his hands together behind Wade\u2019s head. \u201cI haven\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re crazy,\u201d Wade says, but he sounds pretty happy about it. \u201cOr I\u2019m still dreaming. Am I still dreaming?\u201d\nPeter kisses his cheek. \u201cNope, not dreaming,\u201d he promises, just as the elevator slides to a stop. He doesn\u2019t want to disentangle himself from Wade but he does, instead twining their fingers together as they walk through the lobby toward the front doors. There\u2019s not really anywhere to gain total privacy but at least outside they\u2019re surrounded by strangers and the hustle and bustle of the city. People are far less likely to look twice at them.\nWade slouches against a wall, standing in the shade. He tilts his head. \u201cYou still don\u2019t believe me?\u201d he guesses.\n\u201cI do...\u201d\n\u201cBut?\u201d\n\u201cBut I still think you had another reason for coming here today. I mean, why here? Why now? I was supposed to see you tonight anyway.\u201d\nWade folds his arms over his chest. \u201cWell, what\u2019s your theory?\u201d\n\u201cI think you\u2019re testing me. I think you thought I actually would be ashamed to be seen with you.\u201d\nWade scoffs but doesn\u2019t deny it. He gestures around. \u201cDoesn\u2019t exactly seem like you\u2019re proud to me, Peter.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not ashamed,\u201d Peter argues. \u201cI- I wouldn\u2019t mind it if you wanted to go back upstairs right now and kiss me in front of everyone. I don\u2019t care what they know or don\u2019t know or gossip about.\u201d\nWade points. \u201cYes, good idea. Let\u2019s do that.\u201d\n\u201cBut,\u201d Peter stresses. \u201cYou\u2019ve been seen with Spider-Man. And not just seen with him- your picture has been in the paper. Remember that? Remember \u2018getting chummy\u2019?\u201d\n\u201cBoy, do I,\u201d Wade says, suggestive eyebrow waggle implied.\nPeter rolls his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m serious, Wade. People think you and Spider-Man are... I don\u2019t know. Friends, at the very least. Involved, maybe. You start being seen with both of us and-\u201c\n\u201cYou worry too much,\u201d Wade whines. He pushes off the wall, closes the distance between them. He fluffs up Peter\u2019s hair with his fingers, frames his face with his hands. \u201cWay too much. People think you know Spider-Man, right? So that\u2019s how we met. Whatever. I can be friends with Spider-Man and\u2026 friends with you, too. Unless you really are ashamed and this is all some kind of elaborate excuse to make me feel better about it-\u201c\n\u201cI think,\u201d Peter says, lips twitching up into a smile. \u201cThat we\u2019re both a little paranoid.\u201d\n\u201cAw.\u201d Wade places a hand over his own heart. \u201cSomething else we have in common. We\u2019re adorable.\u201d\nPeter chuckles. \u201cAdorably screwed up. We\u2019re gonna make all the other couples jealous.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a beat where they both realize what Peter has just said. \u2018Couples\u2019, as if they are one. There\u2019s another beat where they silently agree not to acknowledge it in any way.\n\u201cYou believe me, right?\u201d Peter asks. \u201cThat I\u2019m not ashamed of you?\u201d\n\u201cI want to. That\u2019s enough for now.\u201d Wade surreptitiously glances around, then pushes his mask up to his nose. Peter meets him halfway for the kiss, using his hold on the front of Wade\u2019s hoodie to draw him down. People are passing by on the sidewalk just a few feet away. Peter doesn\u2019t care. He\u2019d probably let Wade kiss him on national television if it meant putting his fears to rest, his own concerns about his secret identity be damned.\nWade nuzzles at Peter\u2019s throat, plants a kiss there as well, butterfly light. \u201cI really like you,\u201d he says like it\u2019s a secret. \u201cReally really. But I have this bad habit of fucking things up.\u201d\n\u201cI like you, too,\u201d Peter says. He thinks of Black Widow\u2019s packet, still lying unopened on his desk at home.\n\u201cYou\u2019re too good to be true,\u201d Wade sighs. He sounds like he means it.\n-\nLater, Peter is juggling his things, attempting to fumble a key into a lock, and talking to MJ with the phone pressed between his shoulder and his ear. It\u2019s a miracle he manages not to drop anything. \u201cI do like him,\u201d he tells her. \u201cIt\u2019s just- I don\u2019t know if I can be with him. You know?\u201d\nPeter isn\u2019t sure why he thought calling MJ would be a good idea. Since she doesn\u2019t know about his double life he winds up having to be so vague and use so many euphemisms to talk around things that it\u2019s hard to paint a clear picture for her. Still, he\u2019d felt like he needed to talk to someone, and Aunt May was out of the question. MJ may be biased and protective of Peter but she\u2019s not Aunt May level biased and protective.\n\u201cSo\u2026you can\u2019t be with him,\u201d MJ says, voice tinny over the phone line. \u201cBecause he\u2026 did bad things\u2026? What kind of bad things? Is he a serial cheater or something?\u201d\nPeter tosses his keys onto the coffee table. He pointedly avoids looking at his desk. He still catches sight of that damn packet out of the corner of his eye. \u201cNo, no. Nothing like that, it\u2019s just-\u201c\n\u201cIs he a porn star?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? No-\u201c\n\u201cA prostitute? You know, Peter, sex work isn't bad, it's just a job-\u201d\n\u201cUgh, no, stop trying to guess,\u201d Peter groans. \u201cHe\u2019s not a sex worker of any kind.\u201d\n\u201cDrug user, then,\u201d MJ continues guessing. \u201cHe was into the hard stuff and you\u2019re worried about him relapsing.\u201d\nPeter considers. \u201c... Not exactly.\u201d Less drugs, he thinks, more murder. Besides, Wade can\u2019t exactly relapse since he never stopped in the first place. MJ would definitely freak out of he told her that, though. \u201cLook, the point is- I don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t know how much I can trust him, and I don\u2019t know if I can ask him to change.\u201d\n\u201cOh, Peter,\u201d she sighs. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to tell you. He\u2019s not going to hurt you, right? I\u2019ll kick him in the shin if I need to.\u201d\nThat mental image startles a laugh out of him. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019d hurt me on purpose,\u201d he assures her. \u201cBut I\u2019ll let you know if I need him whipped into shape.\u201d\nMJ hesitates. \u201cI\u2019m really glad you found someone,\u201d she says slowly, voice gone serious. \u201cBut please be careful. Promise me, Pete.\u201d\nPeter smiles. Sometimes he\u2019s really glad he has MJ on his side. \u201cI promise.\u201d\n-\nPeter lets Wade take him to dinner and a movie.\nThey don\u2019t call it a date. In fact, it seems like both of them are very carefully avoiding the word. Regardless, that\u2019s what it is. Peter knows it, at least. It was his idea. After Wade\u2019s display at the Bugle, being seen with him in public seemed like the thing to do to help put his fears to rest. It\u2019s worth it for the way Wade seems to revel in it. He\u2019s giddy all night, overflowing with happy energy. It\u2019s contagious. Peter has more fun with Wade in one night, watching one bad movie and eating one cheap meal, than he\u2019s had in years.\nAfter all is said and done, Peter isn\u2019t quite ready to go home and end their night. He\u2019s hesitant to invite Wade over, still thinking of Black Widow\u2019s ominous delivery and his own already-founded misgivings about getting any closer to Wade than he already has. It\u2019s not wise to hand Wade his address. He knows it isn\u2019t.\nHe does it anyway.\n\u201cWalk me home?\u201d he says. Peter doesn\u2019t drink- it messes with his balance too much- but he feels drunk anyway. Buzzed, at least. He can\u2019t stop smiling. It\u2019s all Wade\u2019s fault- he seems to have made a game out of how many times he can get Peter to laugh.\nWade, of course, agrees. As Peter is trying to unlock the door, Wade wraps his arms around him from behind and hooks his chin over Peter\u2019s shoulder. He\u2019s been tactile all night, as though touch-starved. Not that Peter minds in the slightest. \u201cGonna invite me in?\u201d he asks.\nPeter leans back into the hold. Wade is broad and solid and warm and a lot of other adjectives that Peter enjoys. He wants to invite him in. But. There\u2019s always a but. \nWade doesn\u2019t give him time to answer. He turns Peter around, crowds him up against the door. Peter isn\u2019t sure when Wade removed his mask but it\u2019s gone now, the red just peeking out of one of Wade\u2019s pockets. He kisses the corner of Peter\u2019s mouth, his jaw, his neck, leaving a trail of heat in his wake. Peter tilts his head, encouraging him even as he says, \u201cI- I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s smart.\u201d\n\u201cWant me to beg?\u201d Wade asks, sounding almost amused. One of his hands has found its way under Peter\u2019s shirt, is stroking the skin just above the waistband of his jeans. The other is flat against Peter\u2019s back, keeping them close.\nPeter doesn\u2019t reply, too busy making a mental list of pros and cons and getting sidetracked by the thought of Wade on his knees.\nAs if he can read minds, Wade says, \u201cHere, I\u2019ll ask nicely. Can I pretty please blow you?\u201d\nPeter laughs, breathless. His mouth is suddenly very dry. \u201cSo romantic, Wade. You really know how to treat a lady.\u201d\n\u201cSo\u2019s that a yes?\u201d Wade\u2019s fingers drop to Peter\u2019s belt buckle. \u201cHere or inside?\u201d\nPeter laughs again. \u201cOh my god, no. Most of my neighbors are old ladies.\u201d\nWade rests his head on Peter's shoulder. \u201cThey\u2019ve probably seen worse.\u201d\nPeter shakes his head. He nudges Wade\u2019s chin with his fingers, drawing him into a proper kiss. He hopes it softens the blow when he asks, sweetly, \u201cRain check?\u201d It nearly pains him to say it. He wants- he just wants. It feels wrong to get Wade\u2019s hopes up when Peter is so unsure, though. Black Widow definitely accomplished what she set out to do- shake Peter\u2019s faith in Wade and their burgeoning relationship.\nWade groans.\n\u201cYou sound like a dying animal,\u201d Peter notes.\n\u201cI am dying. You\u2019re killing me.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be dramatic.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019m being one hundred percent literal. We\u2019ve found my kryptonite- being rejected by Peter Parker.\u201d\n\u201cNot rejected\u2026 Just postponed.\u201d He coaxes Wade into meeting his gaze. Actually seeing Wade\u2019s eyes is still so novel. \u201cI had fun tonight,\u201d he tells him seriously. \u201cThank you.\u201d\nWade steals one more kiss. He smiles into it. \u201cGoodnight then, baby boy. I\u2019ll see you soon?\u201d\n\u201cI hope so.\u201d\nWade seems reluctant to let go but, finally, he does. He takes a deep breath and steps back. Then, with one last wink, he turns to trot down the stairs. Peter watches him go, internally cursing himself for letting him walk away.\n\u201cDamn responsibility,\u201d he murmurs, finally shoving the key into the lock and pushing the door open with what probably amounts to more force than necessary.\nThe packet is still staring at him from his desk, begging for attention. At first, Peter turns his back, intending to shower and go to bed and continue ignoring it, like always, but then he abruptly changes his mind. He snatches the packet up, marches to the garbage can, and holds it poised to drop.\nHe could just get rid of it. If he doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s in it, he doesn\u2019t have to feel guilty about this thing with Wade. He can just go on living in blissful ignorance. He could call Wade right now and tell him to come back and finish what he started.\nBut\u2026 that\u2019s not entirely true. He still has cause to feel guilty, packet or no packet. He knows what Wade is. A killer. And whether he looks at the Avengers info or not, eventually he\u2019s going to have to face that reality. Eventually, he\u2019s going to have to either confront Wade about it or cut ties. It\u2019s silly to think he and Wade could ever be anything serious when they have such a fundamental disagreement between them.\nPeter doesn\u2019t throw the packet away. He goes and sits at his desk and stares at it.\nHe\u2019s not sure how much time passes. Eventually, he braces himself and opens it.\nIt appears to be copies of every piece of information the Avengers have on Wade. It\u2019s the file Wade joked about them having. Sitting there, for Peter to peruse, is all of Wade\u2019s personal information. His height and weight and birthday. It details the abuse he suffered as a child, his time as a member of Special Forces, his start as a mercenary, and his entry into Weapon X. It lists every person he\u2019s ever been romantically involved with and some of their unfortunate ends.\nPeter feels sick reading it. Mostly with himself because whatever else this is, it\u2019s also a gross invasion of privacy. He can\u2019t seem to stop.\nHe only feels sicker when he reaches the details of what Wade suffered in Weapon X. Peter thinks it would\u2019ve broken a lesser man- and then reminds himself that it did break Wade, which only becomes more and more evident as he scans Wade\u2019s post-Weapon X history. His rapidly escalating kill count, his so-called \u201cepisodes\u201d, his mood swings. There are multiple, tentative psychological diagnoses listed in the margins, including schizophrenia, psychopathy, and sociopathy, each given by a different doctor.\nThe pictures, though, are by far the worst part of the whole thing. Each comes with a detailed report of Wade\u2019s \u201cmission\u201d and its resulting body count. There\u2019s Wade shooting a man at point-blank range in the head, skewering a man on two of his blades, disarming a man by literally removing both of his arms. In his search for this man Francis, which Peter now knows as one of the men responsible for Wade\u2019s condition, Wade spared no one, even men surrendering to him. If they were in any way a part of Weapon X, Wade cut them down without a thought.\nPeter has always known what Wade is and what he does. He even got a taste of it in Colorado. He\u2019d just assumed- he\u2019d hoped- that was an unusual occurrence. A one-time thing. Looking at the file, it would seem the only thing unusual thing about it was that Peter was able to stop Wade from killing that man.\nKnowing and seeing are two different things. Now Peter has irrefutable proof that Wade is just as bad as the evil men Spider-Man defeats. He has no value for human life.\nIt\u2019s hard to reconcile the picture the packet paints with the version of Wade that Peter has come to care for. The Wade he knows makes him laugh, and stops pregnant women from being robbed, and is an insecure mess. The Wade he knows remembers his favorite ice cream flavor and does favors for little girls. The Wade he knows makes him feel... free and happy.\nThen again, can he trust that anything Wade has said and done was genuine? The two little girls he met- were they real? Was that a setup? A deliberate scene to garner Spider-Man\u2019s trust? The mugging attempt? The aftermath of the ninja woman's attack, when Wade had helped him home and taken care of him? Could it be possible that it was all a lie?\nPeter wants, more than anything, not to believe what he\u2019s seeing, and to cling to the version of Wade that he loves.\nBut...\nThere's always a but.\nHe takes out the phone Wade gave him. He runs his finger along the Deadpool sticker on the back. One of the edges is already starting to peel away. Peter smoothes it down.\nHe takes a deep breath, flips the phone open, and hits the call button.\n\u201cWhat, missing me already?\u201d is Wade\u2019s greeting. \u201cI haven\u2019t even made it home yet.\u201d\nPeter bites his lip. He thinks about hanging up.\n\u201cCan you\u2026 come back? We need to talk.\u201d\n\u201cUh-oh,\u201d says Wade. \u201cBe right there.\u201d\nPeter hangs up. He leaves the contents of the packet right where they are and waits.\nPeter isn\u2019t really sure what his face is doing but it must be something not good because concern starts pouring off Wade in waves as soon as he lays eyes on him.\n\u201cPeter?\u201d he asks, taking him by the shoulders. At some point on the journey home, he replaced his mask. Peter can\u2019t decide if it\u2019s going to make things easier or harder, not being able to see his face. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Are you hurt?\u201d\n\u201cUh\u2026 No.\u201d Peter shrugs him off. He nudges the door open the rest of the way, silently directing Wade to enter. Wade does and starts looking around with interest at Peter\u2019s bare-bones apartment. It lacks the personality of Wade\u2019s. You can\u2019t really glean much about Peter Parker from studying it, except that he\u2019s not particularly messy, the clutter of books aside. Wade actually seems disappointed.\n\u201cNice place,\u201d he says. \u201cBut not very you.\u201d\nPeter sighs. \u201cI didn\u2019t invite you back so you could give me decorating tips.\u201d\n\u201cWhy did you invite me, then-\u201c Wade starts to ask, at the same moment his eyes land on the desk, and the pages and pictures spread out atop it.\n\u201cThat,\u201d Peter tells him, watching as he slowly approaches the file and starts sifting through its contents, using one finger to nudge aside papers and photos. \u201cI was hoping\u2026 I mean, I want-\u201c\n\u201cWhere did you get this?\u201d The shift in his mood is palpable. Suddenly he\u2019s angry, defensive- or, at least, teetering on the brink of being both.\nPeter matches his tone without trying. \u201cThe Avengers- Black Widow. I\u2019ve had it for a while. I couldn\u2019t decide if I should look at it or not.\u201d\nWade stops at one page in particular. Peter can\u2019t see what it says but he can guess. It\u2019s probably the page about Wade\u2019s time in Weapon X. The amount of details they were somehow able to garner is, frankly, disturbing. \u201cBut you did look at it.\u201d\nPeter doesn\u2019t bother confirming the obvious. \u201cI want to know if it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\u201cWhich part?\u201d\n\u201cAll of it.\u201d\nWade taps his finger on the desk, hums. \u201cYep,\u201d he says, popping the p. \u201cAll looks pretty true to me. The Avengers are pretty good about fact-checking. What I don\u2019t get is why they gave this to you. To warn you off? It\u2019s none of their fucking business. Hypocrites, the whole motherfucking lot of them.\u201d He whirls on Peter, finally looking at him again. \u201cAnd? Did it work? Are you disgusted with me now? Scared of me? Think I should be thrown in a cell?\u201d He sounds like he thinks he already knows the answer, like he\u2019s already prepared to defend himself.\n\u201cNo, Wade, stop-\u201c\n\u201cYou already knew all this shit, Peter, so don\u2019t you dare-\u201c\n\u201cI thought I knew. I thought I understood what I was getting into, but look at that, Wade. You\u2019re- you\u2019re a killer-\u201c\nWade\u2019s hands are balled into fists at his side. \u201cAre we really doing this? I told you that. I told you exactly that so don\u2019t throw that shit in my face, don\u2019t act like you didn\u2019t know. How many times did I warn you? God, Peter, over and over again, and you never acted like it really phased you, so I thought\u2026\u201d He trails off. He\u2019s slouching, diminishing his own height.\nPart of Peter wants to cross the room and comfort Wade, wants to never have this argument, but the sensible part of him knows that isn\u2019t really an option and never was. Still, he has to fold his arms over his chest to ease the impulse. \u201cI want,\u201d Peter begins, only to be interrupted.\n\u201cI know what you want,\u201d Wade sneers. \u201cYou want me to be a hero, right? A self-fucking-righteous goody two shoes- like you.\u201d He starts pacing, like a caged animal, like he doesn\u2019t know what to do with this sudden surge of adrenaline. \u201cBut guess what? My way is better. My way works. I put assholes in the ground so they can\u2019t hurt anyone else ever again. And you? You fight the same fucking bad guys on repeat because your precious system doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\nPeter\u2019s stomach is turning and his face feels hot. He\u2019s trying to stay calm but it\u2019s difficult in the face of Wade\u2019s abrupt anger. \u201cIs that what you really think?\u201d he asks, voice just this side of eerily serene.\nWade doesn\u2019t answer. Maybe he doesn\u2019t even hear. \u201cYou can\u2019t be this na\u00efve, Peter. You can\u2019t really think the world is this black and white. Shit, I know you\u2019re young, but-\u201c\n\u201cI\u2019m na\u00efve just because I think killing people is wrong?\u201d Peter speaks through gritted teeth. He doesn\u2019t like Wade being angry with him, he likes being angry with Wade even less. And yet. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty basic hero stuff, Wade. Killing is wrong. We put killers behind bars.\u201d\n\u201cRight, cause I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve never killed anyone before. Not even once. And the Avengers? It\u2019s not like they leave a trail of bodies wherever they go, right? How about the X-Men? Have you asked about their kill count recently? Or is it just me you decided to go all Mother Theresa on?\u201d He\u2019s stopped pacing in favor of gesturing wildly. Peter is fairly certain that if he weren\u2019t blocking the door, Wade would have already bolted.\n\u201cIt\u2019s called self-defense,\u201d Peter argues. \u201cNotice I said self-defense. Not vengeance, not senseless slaughter. There\u2019s a difference.\u201d\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t look like much of one from where I\u2019m standing.\u201d He shakes his head- at himself or at Peter, Peter isn\u2019t sure. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you lead me the fuck on. I can\u2019t believe I let you. I should\u2019ve known- too good to be true, right?\u201d\nHe makes as if to leave, stepping toward the door. Peter doesn\u2019t move.\nThey\u2019re just inches apart, Peter tilting his head up, Wade standing at full height again, practically chest to chest. Peter wants to say something to fix this but the words won\u2019t come. He doesn\u2019t know if it can even be fixed. He\u2019s not okay with what Wade does, he can\u2019t tell him it\u2019s fine, but he can\u2019t bring himself to do the opposite, either. To tell him to lose his number or get out of his city. It\u2019s too final.\n\u201cGet out of my way,\u201d Wade practically hisses when Peter neither says nor does anything.\nPeter moves. Wade slams the door shut behind himself.\nPeter goes to bed angry and confused and replaying everything Wade said over and over again in his head.\n-\nIt doesn\u2019t really hit Peter until the next day, the fact that he shouldn\u2019t be expecting any texts or that he can\u2019t just call Wade on his lunch break or that they won\u2019t be meeting up that night for tacos or that Peter probably shouldn\u2019t count on Wade being around to help out with any crime-fighting. For all he knows, Wade\u2019s already skipped town and won\u2019t be back anytime soon.\nAt first, it\u2019s just sort of this vague but persistent irritation, like an itch he can\u2019t scratch. He\u2019ll pick up his Deadpool phone (he thinks about peeling the sticker off, then doesn\u2019t), open it, remember that he and Wade aren\u2019t speaking, and close it again. Or he\u2019ll think of something funny to tell Wade on the phone later, only to realize there won\u2019t be any phone conversations in the foreseeable future.\nAfter the second day, it becomes less an irritation and more a tangible hole in his life. He hadn\u2019t quite realized just how much of his social calendar had been taken over and claimed by Wade. Now, suddenly, he has all this free time. Free time he should be using to study or sleep or clean, but when he tries he just- loses interest. Loses motivation. He can\u2019t stop thinking about Wade, about what he\u2019d rather be doing and with whom.\nBy day four he\u2019s thinking, okay, sure, I miss him now but it\u2019ll pass.\nOnly it doesn\u2019t pass. It just gets worse. He replays their conversation in his head for the millionth time, only this time he changes it. He imagines what he could\u2019ve said to make Wade stay, to make him understand, to keep him from getting angry. He imagines himself saying, I don\u2019t care anymore, I just want to be with you. It\u2019s more true than Peter is comfortable admitting.\nOn day six he tries texting Wade. A plea for the two of them to talk.\nPredictably, there\u2019s no response.\nPeter tries calling. It rings and rings and goes to voicemail. The first several tries, Peter doesn\u2019t leave one, then he figures, why not, and keeps it short and sweet. He asks Wade to please, please call him, just so he knows he\u2019s okay. He says that he really wants to talk, that he doesn\u2019t want them to be on bad terms.\nWade never calls him back.\nIf there\u2019s one thing Peter hates, it\u2019s being ignored. He\u2019d rather have Wade yelling at him again than stonewalling him like this.\nStill, it\u2019s largely on a whim that he decides to deviate from a patrol route one night and swing by Wade\u2019s apartment. He just intends to swing by, not go inside, but then he sees a light on and, well.\nIn his own defense, he does knock on the window first. It\u2019s only when he gets no answer that he slides it open and goes inside, uninvited and grateful that Wade never learned his lesson about locking it.\nThe only light on, the one Peter had seen through the window, is the kitchen light, spilling out into the living room. Peter opens his mouth to call for Wade, only to come up short when he really registers what he\u2019s looking at.\nThe apartment is a mess, and it's not just Wade\u2019s usual brand of messy. It\u2019s actually trashed, as though it\u2019s been ransacked. Couch cushions are ripped open, the TV and bookshelf are toppled over, posters are torn from the walls, Wade\u2019s gaming system is smashed and his DVD collection is scattered in pieces across the concrete floor. The kitchen doesn\u2019t look to be in much better shape. Every dish Wade owns- which, admittedly, isn\u2019t all that many- looks to be broken, the glass spilling across the tile and reflecting the light.\nPeter steps carefully around the mess, picking his way toward the bedroom, growing increasingly concerned, especially once he notices the trail of what looks like blood leading from the front door. \u201cWade?\u201d he calls. No answer.\nHe hesitates with his hand on the doorknob. Is this another invasion of privacy? Peter\u2019s never been in Wade\u2019s room before. He\u2019s never been invited in.\nSpecial circumstances, Peter tells himself and goes in anyway. The door creaks as it opens, the hinges in need of oiling. The only light is that of the moon, slanting in through gaps in the blinds over the bedroom window.\nThe first thing Peter notices is the Deadpool suit and weapons laying across the sheets.\nThen his eyes find Wade, sitting on the floor, propped up against his bed. He\u2019s in plainclothes, chin tilted down, one arm wrapped over himself and the other clutching the teleportation belt.\n\u201cWade\u2026?\u201d Peter ventures, crouching down beside him, but even as he says it he gets that feeling one gets when they\u2019re talking to someone they know can\u2019t hear them. Wade isn\u2019t moving- isn\u2019t even breathing. He\u2019s dead.\nIt\u2019s a weird thing to think. Even weirder that it shouldn\u2019t send Peter into a panic.\n\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d he asks aloud, just because it\u2019s too quiet in the apartment. The moon doesn\u2019t provide much light but it does reveal shiny, wet stickiness on Wade\u2019s hands and clothes. Peter pries Wade\u2019s arm away from his midsection and discovers the source of the blood- a gaping wound in his stomach, at which point Peter is glad there isn\u2019t more light. He can see plenty already.\nHe blows out a breath, not sure what to do. He doesn't know how fast Wade\u2019s healing factor is supposed to be working. He\u2019d healed from that gunshot to the head incredibly quickly. Then again, Peter doesn\u2019t know how long he\u2019s been sitting here. Maybe it's been mere seconds. Maybe the wound is already knitting itself back together and Wade will wake up any at any moment.\nPart of Peter wants to stick around and find out but he knows he\u2019s probably the last person Wade wants to see when he wakes up, and there\u2019s no telling what kind of mood he\u2019ll be in after getting hurt like this. Peter isn\u2019t looking to pick another fight.\nInstead, Peter clears off the bed and helps Wade onto it. It\u2019s not difficult, with his enhanced strength, and Wade is still warm and pliable, which is probably a good sign. At least now maybe Wade won\u2019t wake up with aches and pains from sitting on the floor for so long.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a sap,\u201d Peter tells himself as he places a pillow under Wade\u2019s head. He almost removes Wade\u2019s mask, as well- the only part of the Deadpool suit he\u2019s currently wearing- but stops just short, decides against it. He\u2019s pretty sure he forfeited the right to see Wade\u2019s face. Hopefully just temporarily.\nPeter decides to make one more plea for communication, vows to himself that if he doesn\u2019t hear from Wade this time, he\u2019ll give up. He doesn\u2019t want to force Wade into anything, after all.\nHe has to search but eventually, he finds pen and paper in the kitchen and scrawls a note.\nCall me, please, it says.\nPeter considers, then adds, I miss you.\nHe leaves it on Wade\u2019s nightstand, pauses just long enough to realize that Wade is breathing now. The deep, even breathing of someone who is very, very asleep. It\u2019s a relief, but Peter still leaves feeling unsettled and sad and sure that Wade isn\u2019t going to call.\nThree more days pass before Peter ever hears from Wade. When the phone finally rings- the phone- his stomach sort of bottoms out and he stutters as he answers, shocked. He\u2019d pretty much given up hope, which is why he spent the last three days trying to stay as busy as possible. No time to dwell, that way.\n\u201cPeter?\u201d Wade asks as if it would be anyone else. \u201cWhat are- why does it sound like you\u2019re being yelled at?\u201d He sounds strange. He\u2019s talking fast but deliberately monotone.\nPeter glances over his shoulder, where Jameson is scolding some poor intern. Loudly. He turns back around, shielding the phone from view in case anyone should happen to look over. Not exactly the ideal place for this conversation but Peter isn\u2019t about to lose the opportunity, and there\u2019s enough commotion that he\u2019s pretty sure his voice is drowned out. \u201cIt\u2019s not me getting yelled at,\u201d he tells Wade. \u201cBut I\u2019m at work.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Sorry. What time is it?\u201d\nPeter checks his watch. \u201cAbout ten in the morning.\u201d\n\u201cShit, I thought it was later. Okay, I can- call back or. Something.\u201d\nPeter abruptly realizes that Wade sounds strange because he\u2019s nervous. \u201cWait,\u201d he says, somewhat irrationally afraid that if Wade hangs up now he\u2019ll never hear from him again. He laughs, mostly at himself. \u201cI mean, obviously I want to talk. I\u2019ve been trying to reach you since you stormed out of my apartment.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I\u2026 listened to the voicemails,\u201d Wade says carefully. \u201cAnd got your note... I think maybe I\u2019ve been kind of an asshole.\u201d He makes a sort of self-deprecating noise, tinny over the phone line. \u201cSorry it took me so long to call. There was some shit I had to take care of. Some things I needed to sort out. You know how it is.\u201d\nPeter hunches over, places his hand over the phone, realizes that looks suspicious, and straightens back up. He lowers his voice as he asks, \u201cBy the way, what happened to your place?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cUh, it was kinda trashed last time I was there. Is everything okay? Are you in some kind of trouble?\u201d\n\u201cOh. Um, no. I did that.\u201d\nSince Wade isn\u2019t currently there, Peter directs his mystified look at the nearest wall. \u201cYou wrecked your apartment?\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t exactly planning on coming back and it\u2019s not like I can\u2019t afford to replace all that shit ten times over- Look, it\u2019s a long story. Can I see you? Please? I\u2019m not above begging.\u201d\nThe fact that Peter has been trying for over a week to get in touch with Wade and Wade still thinks he might have to beg to see him strikes Peter as sad. He\u2019s not sure what it says about the state of Wade\u2019s self-esteem, but it can\u2019t be anything good. \u201cYeah, of course. I\u2019ll text you, okay? When I\u2019m done here.\u201d\n\u201cPromise?\u201d\n\u201cPromise.\u201d\nPeter is reluctant to end the call. Maybe Wade is, too, but he says, softly, \u201cSee you later, Spidey,\u201d and that\u2019s their cue. It\u2019s either hang up or risk looking like a clingy dork, so Peter hangs up.\nIt might as well be years rather than a small handful of hours before Peter is done at the Bugle. He checks his watch every five minutes or so like it\u2019s a compulsion. Jameson goes on another rant about Spider-Man but Peter barely notices. He\u2019s pretty sure a couple of people attempt to have conversations with him. He doesn\u2019t mean to brush them off, but he\u2019s distracted. He's too busy trying to organize his thoughts and figure out what the hell he\u2019s going to say to Wade.\nIt was Peter\u2019s idea to meet somewhere public. Neutral territory. As soon as he\u2019s free of the Bugle, he dons his Spider-Man suit and webs his way to the chosen rooftop. It seemed appropriate. Secluded but not hidden and familiar to them both. Besides, Peter would be lying if he said the mask wasn\u2019t something of a security blanket.\nHe absolutely expects Wade to show up in uniform, as well. Instead, he shows up wearing baggy jeans and a sweater that\u2019s just big enough to make him look smaller than he really is. He\u2019s not even wearing his mask. He\u2019s making himself vulnerable, Peter realizes. He\u2019s reluctant to remove his own mask but it doesn\u2019t seem right to be the only one hiding his face. He slips it off as Wade approaches, hands stuffed in his pockets and chin ducked. Sheepish.\n\u201cHi,\u201d Peter says. Wade takes a seat beside him, their legs dangling over the edge of the building. The people on the streets below look like little more than ants. Neither of them has much cause to be afraid of heights.\n\u201cHi,\u201d Wade parrots. He won\u2019t quite look at Peter.\n\u201cYou want me to go first?\u201d Peter asks before an awkward silence can set in. He doesn\u2019t wait for an answer. \u201cCause I can totally do that. I\u2019ve been thinking about what I want to say since last time I saw you. And- I guess\u2026 I still don\u2019t really know. But \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019 seems like a good place to start.\u201d\nThat gets Wade\u2019s attention. He looks up, finally. \u201cYou\u2019re sorry? What the fuck for?\u201d\n\u201cFor going through that file, for starters. I had no right.\u201d\nWade shakes his head. \u201cNone of that stuff was secret. You could\u2019ve asked me about any of it, Peter. My past, Weapon X, Vanessa- whatever. I would\u2019ve told you anything you wanted to know.\u201d\n\u201cWould you? Without getting defensive? Without hiding anything?\u201d\nHe glowers. \u201cI was starting to think I didn\u2019t need to.\u201d\n\u201cLook,\u201d Peter sighs. \u201cI- I stand by my beliefs. My uncle used to say \u2018with great power comes great responsibility'. He meant a responsibility to protect people, but he also meant a responsibility not to abuse that power. I can\u2019t appoint myself judge, jury, and executioner. I just can\u2019t. What if I pull the trigger on an innocent? On someone\u2019s mom or dad or brother or kid? I\u2019ve had people taken away from me- I can\u2019t do that to someone else. Not if there\u2019s another way.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve lost people too, you know. You don\u2019t have that market cornered.\u201d\n\u201cI know that. Hell, Wade, after what you\u2019ve been through\u2026 Most people would\u2019ve given up a long time ago, I think. But not you. You still try, and I think that\u2019s amazing.\u201d\nThe resignation on Wade\u2019s face turns to tentative hope. It's an expression that he quickly and deliberately stifles. Peter could go on. He could probably alternate between singing Wade\u2019s praises and apologizing for a few hours and not run out of words, but curiosity is niggling at him. He can\u2019t stop thinking about the way he\u2019d found Wade a few nights ago.\n\u201cSo,\u201d he says, when Wade stays silent. \u201cWanna tell me what happened the other night? You know, right before I walked in on you bleeding out.\u201d That isn\u2019t strictly true- by the time Peter arrived, Wade had already done the bleeding out. He just can\u2019t bring himself to put it in more plain terms.\nWade blows out a breath. \u201cSo it\u2019s my turn, huh? You want the short version? After our, uh, talk- I was pretty pissed off. Went home, trashed the place, decided I was fucking done with New York. Then I went out and picked a fight because- I don\u2019t know. Because that\u2019s what I do, I guess. I wanted to punch someone in the face so I went and found someone to punch in the face. And then\u2026\u201d He hesitates.\nPeter nudges his foot with his own, silently urging him to go on.\n\u201cI took a job,\u201d Wade admits. He\u2019s staring hard at his own hands. \u201cKind of just to spite you. Fucked up, right? But it was a bad dude, a guy I thought deserved to die. I figured someone should hurt him before he could hurt anyone else. So I was getting all set up to take him out. Doing all the research, planning all the plans- the boring stuff you have to do before you can actually make the hit. But I just kept thinking about you. About how you\u2019re the only hero who\u2019s ever treated me with any goddamn respect. About the way you look at me. Like- like I\u2019m-\u201c He glances over. \u201cLike that.\u201d\nPeter can feel himself blushing. He wasn\u2019t aware he looked at Wade in any kind of way that could be considered special. He tries to school his expression into something more neutral and, if the way the corner of Wade\u2019s mouth quirks up is any indication, probably fails.\nPeter clears his throat. \u201cDid you go through with it?\u201d\nWade scoffs. \u201cNah. Thinking about your dumb puppy eyes took all the fun out of it. So I backed out. But the guys who hired me- they didn\u2019t like that. They came around to try and talk me into it. But I\u2026 was still feeling\u2026 Uh, kinda low. Might\u2019ve run my mouth a little bit, goaded them into a fight.\u201d\n\u201cA fight that you lost.\u201d\n\u201cThere were a lot of them,\u201d Wade says, defensive \u201cAnd I was trying not to kill any of them. But- yeah. I lost. Had to teleport out of there once I got hurt bad enough because fuck knows what they would\u2019ve done with my corpse.\u201d\n\u201cSo you came back here?\u201d\n\u201cIt was the first place I thought of\u2026 And I guess I kinda missed it.\u201d He pauses, flicks another glance in Peter\u2019s direction, and admits, \u201cAnd you.\u201d\nPeter hums. \u201cYou didn\u2019t kill a guy\u2026 because of me,\u201d he says. \n\u201cBasically. Which is stupid, right? Cause we\u2019ve got no chance. Doesn\u2019t matter how many I guys I don\u2019t kill, you\u2019ll just bolt the next time I fuck up-\u201c\n\u201cWho says there\u2019ll be a next time?\u201d\nWade doesn\u2019t so much roll his eyes as he does his entire body, like he thinks Peter is being denser than anyone has ever been before. \u201cThere\u2019s always a next time. Have you even met me?\u201d His fingers are tapping out an uneven rhythm against his knee, more rapidly as his agitation grows. \u201cI\u2019ve tried before. To be- better. A hero. But something always pulls me back and I fuck up and suddenly everyone wants to be first in line to say they knew I was no good all along, that I could never change- all that shit. Eventually, you just start to think they\u2019re right, you know?\u201d\nWhile Peter is willing to admit that he\u2019s grown immensely partial to Wade, he\u2019s never felt all that protective of him. Until now. Now he wants to knock the heads of anyone who\u2019s ever been mean to him. It\u2019s a childish impulse, though, and he\u2019s not sure Wade would appreciate the sentiment anyway.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t come here to offer you an ultimatum, Wade.\u201d\n\u201cThen why did you come here?\u201d\n\u201cHopefully the same reason you wanted to see me. I just\u2026 don\u2019t want to lose you. Even if we can only be friends, or-\u201c\n\u201cEven if I keep up the mercenary work?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong- if you\u2019re willing to try, that\u2019s great. But unless you start killing the good guys, or you tell me to leave\u2026 I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d\n\u201cYou have no idea how hard that is for me to believe.\u201d With an irritated noise, Wade gets to his feet and starts to pace across the rooftop. Peter stands, too, watches him with arms folded over his chest. He\u2019s clearly having some sort of internal debate. Peter doesn\u2019t push him, just waits it out, but every second that passes leaves him more terrified. Peter has never felt more like an exposed nerve than he does at this moment. He's compromising his own beliefs, putting himself out there in a way he's never done before, not even with MJ. He's not sure he could take a rejection from Wade. Not now.\n\u201cI want to believe it,\u201d Wade says after a moment, coming to a stop just out of arms' reach. \u201cBut it seems too good to be true.\u201d\n\u201cSo let me prove it.\u201d Peter practically begs. He steps forward, takes Wade by the shoulders. His touch has an apparent calming effect because Wade deflates under his hands, the tension draining from him. That naked hope in his eyes is back, and this time he does nothing to quell it. \u201cI know it\u2019s not going to be easy, Wade. We\u2019re both\u2026 We have a lot of issues.\u201d He smiles, to take the sting out of the words. \u201cBut I want to try. Don\u2019t you?\u201d\nWade catches his lip between his teeth while he thinks. He takes one of Peter\u2019s hands in his own, threads and unthreads their fingers. Finally, he says, \u201cYeah. We can try.\u201d\nThose three simple words lift a massive weight from Peter's shoulders. He feels like he can breathe again. \u201cAnd all is forgiven?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll forgive you for snooping if you forgive me for being an asshole.\u201d\nPeter beams up at him. Wade returns his smile and it's the best thing Peter's ever seen. \u201cDone.\u201d\nWade is still turning Peter\u2019s hand over in his. \u201cSo,\u201d he says, trying hard to sound casual. His eyes drop to Peter\u2019s fingers. \u201cAbout this \u2018just friends\u2019 thing\u2026\u201d\nPeter\u2019s grin turns sly. \u201cWhat about it?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yeah, we could be just friends, if that\u2019s what you want\u2026 Or you could take me back to your place and I could finally give you that blowjob.\u201d\nPeter\u2019s nod is perhaps a little too enthusiastic, because Wade laughs at him. It's such a fond, happy laugh, though, that Peter forgets to feel embarrassed.\nPeter has to juggle a plate of fresh-baked cookies and brownies to be able to ring the doorbell. Wade\u2019s idea. A pre-emptive peace offering, maybe. Wade had made them himself. It took a little bit of trial and error but this batch was, in his own words, so good that whoever tried them would fall instantly in love with him. \nPeter glances at Wade, now standing on the stoop beside him and looking anxious. \u201cWould you stop fidgeting? Jesus. You\u2019d think we were going to meet the Pope, not my Aunt.\u201d\n\u201cBasically the same thing,\u201d Wade mumbles. He puts his hood up, then down, then up again. He groans. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t I just use my shiny new image inducer? She\u2019s gonna be so grossed out. She probably won\u2019t even let me come in. Peter- she\u2019s going to think I\u2019m not good enough for you.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019d probably think that even if you looked like a supermodel,\u201d Peter points out. \u201cBut seriously, Wade, you look fine. Everything\u2019s going to be fine. Just be yourself.\u201d\nWade nods. \u201cRight,\u201d he mutters. \u201cMyself. Got it.\u201d\n\u201cJust,\u201d Peter amends. \u201cNo sex jokes. Or cursing. And don\u2019t talk about the whole mercenary thing.\u201d\n\u201cFour months and no kills!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, babe, and I\u2019m super proud of you but please don\u2019t brag about that in front of my Aunt. And maybe use your inside voice.\u201d\nWade makes a show of lowering his own volume. He shoots Peter a thumbs up.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Peter adds. \u201cAnd she thinks you were in the army.\u201d\n\u201cThe army?\u201d Wade sputters. \u201cLike the American army? Peter, I\u2019m not even American.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026 Uh, yeah, don\u2019t mention that, either.\u201d\nAunt May doesn\u2019t even ask who it is before she swings the door wide, catching Wade in the middle of an eye roll. She\u2019s already grinning. She doesn\u2019t immediately acknowledge Peter in favor of greeting Wade, eyes traveling from his head to his feet and back again. She\u2019s been wanting to meet him since Peter officially declared the two of them together months ago. Peter isn\u2019t the least bit surprised at the lack of judgment he finds in her expression, but Wade seems to be. He acts downright shocked when the first thing she\u2019s does after they\u2019ve exchanged pleasantries is pull him into a hug.\nPeter is largely ignored for the rest of the evening, but he\u2019s pretty okay with it. Watching Wade first stutter his way through dinner and then, later, bond with his Aunt over home and gardening television is both adorable and entertaining. Once Wade is sure that Aunt May isn\u2019t going to bite his head off he loosens up and starts cracking jokes. At one point, he has Aunt May doubled over she\u2019s laughing so hard.\nPeter loves his Aunt, she\u2019ll always be his favorite person, and seeing her gush over Wade- who has quickly become his second favorite person- has him feeling all warm and fuzzy and downright enamored. Of both of them but especially of Wade, who\u2019s been trying so hard these last few months. Peter feels a swell of pride and affection when Aunt May passes him on her way to the kitchen and pauses just long enough to wink and whisper, \u201cGood catch, Peter. I like him.\u201d\n\u201cMe too,\u201d Peter agrees, grinning. As soon as his Aunt May is gone from the room, Peter plants himself beside Wade on the couch, eager to be close. \u201cSee?\u201d he says. \u201cTold you there was nothing to be worried about.\u201d\nWade obligingly throws an arm over Peter\u2019s shoulders, pulling him closer still. \u201cAll part of my plan to supplant you as the favorite.\u201d\n\u201cShut up.\u201d Peter digs an elbow into Wade\u2019s side. \u201cI\u2019ll always be the favorite.\u201d\n\u201cGive it time. She hasn\u2019t tried the brownies yet.\u201d There\u2019s mirth in Wade\u2019s eyes. It\u2019s infectious and Peter is helpless to do anything but smile back at him. Wade plants a kiss on his cheek and lingers there, nuzzling at him in a way that\u2019s more playful and affectionate than anything. He\u2019s practically exuding happiness.\nPeter loves him.\nThis isn\u2019t news, exactly, but it\u2019s the first time Peter\u2019s thought of it like that. In those words.\n\u201cUh,\u201d he says aloud. He hadn\u2019t meant to.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Wade asks, pulling back, head tilted like a quizzical puppy.\nPeter blushes. \u201cI was just\u2026 thinking,\u201d he says slowly. He can\u2019t tell Wade now. It\u2019s- not the right time. Instead, he brings up something else he\u2019s been considering. \u201cYou know how you\u2019re at my place most of the time now?\u201d\n\u201cYeah\u2026?\u201d A worried crease appears on Wade\u2019s forehead.\n\u201cNot that I mind!\u201d Peter rushes to add. \u201cActually, what I was thinking was\u2026 What if you just kinda\u2026 stayed there. All the time.\u201d\n\u201cYou want me to move in with you?\u201d Peter can\u2019t glean anything from Wade\u2019s tone or expression.\n\u201cYes?\u201d Peter ventures. \u201cIt\u2019s silly for you to keep your place, right? You\u2019re never really there anyway,\u201d he justifies. \u201cAnd most of your stuff has migrated to my apartment already so it\u2019s not like it\u2019d be that different-\u201c\n\u201cYou want me to move in with you?\u201d Wade reiterates.\nPeter shifts around as he tries to fish something out of his pocket. \u201cI kinda already had an extra key made,\u201d he says, holding it up. \u201cIt\u2019s cool if you don\u2019t want to, though. You can still have the key, just in case or whatever-\u201c\nWade snatches the key, eyes wide. \u201cHoly shit. Yes. Yes, baby boy, of course I\u2019ll move in with you! What the fuck!\u201d\n\u201cShh,\u201d Peter hisses, glancing around for his Aunt. He can still hear the faucet running in the kitchen so he figures they\u2019re safe until she gets the dishes done. \u201cLanguage!\u201d\nWade is holding the key like it\u2019s a sacred artifact. \u201cI\u2019m going to be the best fucking roommate ever,\u201d he says, ignoring Peter\u2019s warning. \u201cThis is the second-best day of my life now, oh my god.\u201d\nPeter grins, then falters. \u201cWait, second best? What was the first best?\u201d\n\u201cLast week, when you finally let me-\u201c\n\u201cOkay!\u201d Peter yelps, cutting him off. \u201cEnough of that!\u201d He pauses, then adds, \u201cBut yeah, that was pretty great.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Wade agrees, giddy. He leans in and kisses Peter properly, the two of them smiling into it.\nYeah, Peter loves him. Though Wade\u2019s never said as much, he\u2019s pretty sure the feeling is mutual."
