    "text": "They find him sometime between too late and too early in the same alley the last guy left him in. He\u2019s taking a breather, thank you very much, slumped against a brick wall. He\u2019s fine. Everything hurts, and he\u2019s not really sure how long he\u2019s been sitting there, but he\u2019s not a child, he\u2019s a hero, he\u2019s  fine.\nBut when three of the most notorious villains in the city (state? country?), the three leaders of the widely feared Syndicate, kneel down around him, expressions softened with worry and sharpened with a rage Tommy knows is not directed at him, he can\u2019t help but feel like a little kid. He can\u2019t help but  want  to be held and protected and cared for.\nSo when the man in the boar skull mask reaches out a hand, movements slow like he\u2019s approaching a wounded animal, Tommy allows the coddling.\nHe knows he\u2019s a mess, but if he didn\u2019t, he\u2019d be able to tell by the way a spark lights a wildfire fury in the garnet red eyes tracking over his face as he tilts it up with gentle fingers under his chin.\n\u201cWho did this to you?\u201d the Blood God growls, low and dangerous. And anyone in their right mind would be afraid, would be shitting their pants, but Tommy just flicks his eyes to the floor and mumbles that it doesn\u2019t matter.\nEcho hums softly, brushing his fingers gently over the bruises coloring Tommy\u2019s cheek, stopping at the gash over his eyebrow before carding through his hair. Tommy doesn\u2019t mean to lean into the touch, he knows these men are dangerous, are deadly, but he can\u2019t help but feel safe, wrapped up in their brutal care.\nHis chin is still held lightly by the Blade and Echo seems to find as much comfort in the rhythmic movement of his fingers through Tommy\u2019s hair as Tommy does.\n\u201cIt matters,\u201d the Angel says, soft and lilting, the beak of his mask angling down slightly as he tilts his head, tinted lenses reflecting Tommys face back at him, \u201cIt matters because no one gets to touch what\u2019s ours.\u201d\n\u201cNo one gets to touch  you, Toms,\u201d Echo vows and god knows Tommy should be afraid, but he isn\u2019t, he  isn\u2019t, so he tells them the name and he knows it\u2019s a death sentence.\nAnd he knows he should care more\u2014he knows it should bother him  so much more\u2014because Tommy is a hero, Tommy is supposed to  save  people from the bad guys. He\u2019s not supposed to get people killed, not even the bad ones. He\u2019s certainly not supposed to lean into the bad guys\u2019 touch or curl into their arms because he\u2019s exhausted or send them on hunts after someone who hit him a little too hard.\n\u201cYour ribs are broken, Tommy,\u201d the Blade says softly, the sound of it rumbling against the ear Tommy has pressed to his chest, and  god  why are the villains always so careful with him? Why are they the first people in so,  so  long whose touch doesn\u2019t  hurt? \u201cAnd while I don\u2019t think you have a concussion, it looks like you hit your head  hard, kid. That\u2019s not \u2018a little\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cNot to mention how thin you are,\u201d the Angel adds, only half directed at him now and dripping with genuine concern. \u201cWhen\u2019s the last proper meal you had?\u201d\nAt Tommy\u2019s shrug, Echo\u2019s hand pauses, only resuming in response to Tommy\u2019s displeased whine. \u201cToms, darling,\u201d he starts and Tommy sighs because nothing good happens when he starts with the pet names, \u201care your parents not feeding you?\u201d\nEcho\u2019s hand very deliberately does not falter as Tommy replies, but Tommy can  feel  the tension in the Blood God and the three exchange looks over his head that are almost loud enough he can hear them.\n\u201cDon\u2019t have parents  to  feed me, big man. I\u2019m not a child, I don\u2019t need anyone to take care of me.\u201d He grumbles, but for the first time in a long time, Tommy doesn\u2019t even try to cover the obvious lie. He thinks maybe he doesn\u2019t have to, not here, not with these people he thinks of first when he thinks of \u2018family\u2019.\nThe Angel makes a soft wounded sound and the Blood God rearranges him so he\u2019s cradling him close to his chest when he stands. And Tommy, Tommy should fight, should be afraid of these men who have so much blood on their hands, but he can\u2019t bring himself to care. Instead he presses closer to the Blade\u2019s steady warmth, counting his heartbeat out, pretending this isn\u2019t such a monumental betrayal made without hesitation.\nInstead, when Echo says, \u201cSleep, Toms, we\u2019re going home,\u201d Tommy trusts him, Tommy listens, drifting off in the safety of the Blood God\u2019s arms.\n\u00a0\n\u2013 \u2727 \u2013\n\u00a0\nWhen he wakes up, there\u2019s late afternoon light streaming in through unfamiliar blinds in an unfamiliar room. He should be afraid, but the pillow underneath his head rises and falls with soft, even breathing. He should be afraid, but there are familiar arms wrapped around him and he couldn\u2019t feel safer if he tried.\n\u201cWelcome to the world, kid,\u201d the Blood God says from the doorway. Only when Tommy looks up, he freezes because he\u2019s  not wearing his mask.\n\u201cBlade,\u201d he starts, panicked, half tempted to cover his eyes like the man forgot he had a face that was linked to a secret identity and a hero in his spare bedroom (except there\u2019s framed newspaper clippings of Tommy\u2019s accomplishments hanging on the walls and the quilt is bright red and it looks like somebody\u2019s room\u2014no, it looks like  his  room and he\u2019s not awake enough to process that yet, so he shelves it for now).\nBut he\u2019s interrupted by an amused, \u201cTechno.\u201d\nTommy blinks. And then blinks again.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cMy name,\u201d the Blade\u2014Techno, apparently, says.\nThis, of course, in no way stops Tommy\u2019s panic. \u201cWh- You- What, no, man, you can\u2019t just- just  tell me your name!!\u201d\nHe gets a huff in response to his incredibly sound logic which just makes him even  more  concerned that it was Blade- Techno who had the head injury instead of him.\n\u201cWhy not? You\u2019re in our house, you\u2019ve got a room, you might as well know my name.\u201d\nAnd, well, ha, okay, okay. So. Tommy has a room. In their house. Tommy knows the Blood God\u2019s name, has seen-  is currently seeing the Blood God\u2019s stupid  face. He needs a minute. Just one minute to process without-\n\u201cWilbur,\u201d says the sleepy voice behind him. \u201cThere. Now you know both our names.\u201d\nTommy whips his head around to stare incredulously at Echo- Wilbur now. \u201cWhat the fuck?!\u201d\nEcho\u2019s mask, a pretty porcelain thing like something out of an opera or a masquerade, is gone too, leaving just- Wilbur. Soft, sleep rumpled Wilbur. The dark, glittering makeup that\u2019s usually beneath his eyes is wiped clean as well and the only proof it was ever there rests in what clings told his lash line.\nFucking hell. They\u2019re both in pajamas. Two of the most feared villains in the- fuck, probably the whole goddamn world and they\u2019re in  fucking pajamas.\nTechno\u2019s not even in  respectable  pajamas. His are sky blue fuzzy sleep pants decorated with cute little pig faces. Wilbur\u2019s in normal sweatpants at least but his t-shirt is some obscure band no one has ever heard of. God, they\u2019re fucking dorks. They\u2019re the scariest fuckers Tommy\u2019s ever seen, but they\u2019re fucking dorks. And  massive  softies.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re done freaking out,\u201d Techno drawls, amusement clear in the dry tone, \u201cPhil made pancakes. It\u2019s like four in the afternoon, but he\u2019s excited, so,\u201d he gestures vaguely behind him, \u201cfood.\u201d\nTommy decides to freak out over the Angel of Death being named  Phil  later in favor of climbing off of Wilbur for pancakes.\n\u201cHi, mate,\u201d the Angel of fucking Death greets, standing in the kitchen with an apron tied around his waist and flour on his hands. \u201cChocolate chip or blueberry?\u201d\n\u201cOkay what the  fuck,\u201d he asks laughing. \u201cDid I die? Is this hell?\u201d\nWilbur scoffs loudly from behind him, ruffling his hair as he passes. \u201cThat\u2019s so rude. I know Phil isn\u2019t  that  great of a cook, but he\u2019s not that bad.\u201d\n\u201cGood news, Tommy, Tech, you get more pancakes. Wilbur, you can starve.\u201d\nAnd so breakfast goes on with only minor chaos. It\u2019s the middle of the day, it\u2019s a kitchen table of villains and a hero amongst them. Tommy allows it to happen, allows himself to get swept up in it all and pretends it won\u2019t end soon.\nOnly it doesn\u2019t end. It doesn\u2019t and doesn\u2019t and doesn\u2019t and then it\u2019s three weeks later and Tommy\u2019s helping Phil with dinner and can\u2019t stop the question from spilling over his lips like a glass shattering in peaceful silence.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\nPhil stops, briefly, to look over at him, confusion mixing with concern. \u201cWe\u2019re making mac and cheese?\u201d he answers but it lifts like a question because there\u2019s a weight in the air now that Tommy put there and Phil doesn\u2019t seem to know where it\u2019s coming from.\n\u201cNo, I mean with everything\u2014the room, the rides to school, the,\u201d he cuts himself off, gesturing broadly at the rest of the house. \u201cWhat\u2019s- what\u2019s going on, Phil, I don\u2019t fuckin-.\u201d\nUnderstanding blooms and then Phil softens impossibly, turning his whole body to face Tommy. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I should\u2019ve- Tommy, I want to adopt you.\u201d\nAnd Tommy, fuck, Tommy didn\u2019t expect that. He doesn\u2019t- He-\nHe sits down. On the floor. Phil laughs lightly and kneels in front of him, hands brushing away tears that Tommy didn\u2019t know he was crying.\n\u201cYou alright, mate?\u201d\nTommy looks up at him. \u201cYou want-  me,\u201d he asks, eyes too wide, voice too small. \u201cYou- Me? A hero? A loud, annoying-\u201c\nBut Phil just tugs him into a hug, and presses a kiss against his hair. \u201cOh, Toms, of course we want you.  Of course  we do.\u201d\nAnd they prove it, over and over again. They drive him to school every morning and pick him up every afternoon. Phil packs his lunch and leaves stupid little notes in it that Tommy pretends to find annoying. Wilbur plays his songs at Tommy\u2019s request and never lets him go more than a few hours without a hug whether he likes it or not. And yeah, maybe he does. But he\u2019s not gonna fucking say it, he\u2019s got his pride after all.\nThey don\u2019t stop him being a hero, they don\u2019t try to corrupt him or force him to their side. And Tommy doesn\u2019t snoop through their drawers to find their blueprints and plans, only showing up when he hears the police radio mention the newest bank robbery.\nTommy tries to stop them and they try to stop him stopping them both because that\u2019s their jobs and they don\u2019t need people realizing the connection. But when it does happen (and it does), the Syndicate saves their little golden hero with a viciousness anyone in their right mind would tremble at. Tommy, though, Tommy just steps over one of the bodies with a slight grimace as he\u2019s led out of the newest warehouse to be bundled in a getaway car and taken home.\n Home, Tommy thinks, smiling into his brother\u2019s chest.  I\u2019m finally home. \n\u00a0\nEmergency lights paint the room a deadly sort of scarlet. Alarms blare loudly, signaling  get out, signaling  run for your fucking lives, but Tommy\u2019s here, crouched behind a shelf, praying to every single god he can think of that he makes it home tonight.\nHe could run, he  could, but he doesn\u2019t.\nTommy\u2019s a hero, he saves people. This is his job, he can\u2019t be a coward, he can\u2019t run just because it\u2019s scary, just because he\u2019s  alone.\nDoor hinges squeak somewhere in the dark and red, and Tommy\u2019s limbs turn to stone, freezing him in place, like a deer in headlights.\n Oh shit, he thinks, clear as a bell.  Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit. \nSomeone\u2019s in the room. Someone\u2019s in the  fucking room oh god-\nThe footsteps are light, coming closer, coming right towards him. He takes a deep breath, silent but shaking like it\u2019s gonna come apart.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to fight me,\u201d someone says and Tommy\u2019s heart sinks to his goddamn toes.\nThe Blood God, if you haven\u2019t turned on the news in the past six years, is part of a trio of supervillains called the Syndicate. They are the most notorious criminals in the city- in the country really. Maybe in the world. The Blood God, in particular, is known for being ruthless and cruel. The Blade, some call him. He\u2019s more weapon than man, people say.\nHe\u2019s also in the same room as Tommy, just meters away from where he\u2019s hiding. Tommy, a  hero, meant to stop him,  here  to stop him.\n\u201cYou could just run,\u201d he offers, and Tommy wants to, god does he want to, but he is a  hero  and this is his  job.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Tommy says, all bravado and stupid, foolish bravery, \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d\nThe footsteps go silent and Tommy invents a series of new, fun swears. Shame no one will ever learn them since he\u2019s going to die here.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nTommy laughs, high and scared. He steps out of his hiding place, turning to face the villain. \u201cBecause I\u2019m a hero.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a kid,\u201d the Blade says, looking him up and down through the boar skull mask adorning his face.\nHe\u2019s bigger in real life, taller, but slim, not broad. His pink hair is tied in a long braid, save a few pieces that have come loose to frame his face. He\u2019s wearing an expensive looking black suit with a crimson vest over a black shirt and tie. When he moves, Tommy notes, a little hysterically, that even the inside of his suit jacket matches the vest. Gold drips from every place possible, multiple hoops and chains adorn his ears and there are layers of thin ropes hanging from his neck, bangles from his wrists, and rings on his fingers. There\u2019s a crown sitting lopsided on his head. He\u2019s  gilded, Tommy thinks, giddy on terror.\n\u201cSeriously, how old are you? Ten?\u201d\nTommy glares, \u201cI\u2019m  fourteen.\u201d\nHis answer sends the villain a step back, brings his hands up in a placating gesture. But Tommy doesn\u2019t care. Tommy is a hero.\nHe lunges. The Blood God catches his wrists.\nIt\u2019s pathetic, really, how quickly frustrated tears well up and spill over, how easily Tommy crumbles.\nThe place where the villain holds his wrists  burns  and when he tugs, ever so gently, Tommy falls into him. Something in him aches and shatters and maybe,  maybe  heals, just slightly.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, kid,\u201d the Blood God murmurs into his hair as Tommy  sobs. \u201cYou\u2019re okay.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u2013 \u2727 \u2013\n\u00a0\nThe bruises coloring Tommy\u2019s ribs hurt with every breath he takes, but Dream says it\u2019s good for him, the pain is  good, it\u2019ll help him learn how to push through. That\u2019s why he never holds back when he spars with Tommy, he says, because the bad guys won\u2019t. The bad guys  will  kill Tommy, but the Blood God had held him carefully, like Tommy was deserving of it. The Blood God had held him, let him cry and cry and cry, and then let him run.\nDream taught Tommy how to be a hero, Dream trains him, Dream cares about him.\nBut.  But. But the Blade had held him. The Blade had-\nNo,  no. It was a trick, a trap,  something. A game he was playing with Tommy to get him to lower his guard, to get information on- on the heroes. It was a trick, it had to be.\nIt had to be because the man is in the middle of the chaos Tommy\u2019s been sent to stop. He\u2019s laughing, he\u2019s got blood splattered on his mask.\nOnly he\u2019s not the only one there, in the eye of the storm. All three members of the Syndicate are involved, and Tommy, Tommy\u2019s been sent to stop them. But his ribs hurt. His ribs hurt and his ankle is swollen and he doesn\u2019t  want  to do this. He\u2019s compromised. He\u2019s outnumbered.\nHe\u2019s fucked, to put it lightly.\nBut this is his job. This is what he was made for, so Tommy throws himself into the fight and the villains, they meet him halfway.\nEcho starts with overly exaggerated moves, all flourish, all for the show, but Tommy was taught to fight hard, to fight dirty, and the man quickly has to adjust to keep up with him.\n\u201cThis  is your kid?\u201d Echo calls over his shoulder, laughter and incredulity rich in his voice.\nTommy growls, smoke curling up from his palms, twining lazily around his forearms, flames licking in their wake.\nThe Blood God is somewhere behind him, fighting off police officers or- the fight turns and Tommy can see him. He\u2019s fighting a- another bad guy. The man goes down and then someone aims a gun at  Tommy, but he\u2019s down too before Tommy can even move to hide.\nWhat the fuck.\n\u201cI told you he was a hero,\u201d the Blade shoots back, petty and lighthearted and everything Tommy has never experienced.\nEcho scoffs, \u201cYou also said he was  ten.\u201d\nWhat the  fuck.\nTommy sends a particularly vicious burst of flames his way. \u201cI\u2019m  fourteen,\u201d he spits, but then he moves wrong and his ribs protest sharply. He hisses and in a flash of movement Tommy can\u2019t follow (and he bristles slightly at the thought of them holding back, going easy on him just because he\u2019s  young), Echo has his wrists held tight but gentle, not hard enough to bruise, not that it matters because the bruises are already there and Tommy winces at the painful reminder of Dream\u2019s grip. Echo drops him like the touch burned (it did, for Tommy at least, it was kinder than Dream is, it was, it was-) the second he sees Tommy\u2019s reaction.\n\u201cYou\u2019re hurt,\u201d he says, standing still in what Tommy now realizes is an empty room save the four, save the hero surrounded by villains.\nTommy glares, he bites back a growl, flicking his eyes over three obscured faces. He can see Echo\u2019s eyes at least, under the dark makeup surrounding them. They look concerned. They look  angry.\nIt feels like he\u2019s backed into a corner, it feels like he\u2019s some wild feral thing, just waiting to strike.\n\u201cTraining,\u201d he spits because surely they\u2019ll understand that. Surely they\u2019ll understand that he\u2019s not a  child, he\u2019s not something to be coddled. He\u2019s a wildfire, he\u2019s gasoline. He\u2019s as strong as they are, as capable. He can take it.\nOnly the anger in Echo\u2019s eyes deepens as confusion slips away and understanding dawns. \u201cTraining?\u201d he starts, poison lacing his sharp tone, but he\u2019s interrupted by a hand on his shoulder as the Blood God passes him to kneel in front of Tommy.\n\u201cWho\u2019s your mentor?\u201d he asks, his voice steady and dangerously calm, but Tommy shakes his head. He can\u2019t give them this, he  won\u2019t. Not after everything Dream has done for him, not when he owes Dream his life so many times over.\nThe Blade reaches out, and Tommy  bolts.\nThe bruises when he returns empty handed are a lesson he promises to heed.\n\u00a0\n\u2013 \u2727 \u2013\n\u00a0\nThe encounters don\u2019t stop. Dream says it\u2019s a good thing, and starts sending him out on more missions to stop them. Dream says they can use him, let him get close to the trio, and then report back whatever he learns to help them take the Syndicate down.\nDream says that Tommy just has to be strong, just has to be smart enough to trick the villains into trusting him.\nWhen Tommy swears that he can do this, he\u2019s lying through his teeth, but Dream doesn\u2019t seem to notice.\n\u00a0\n\u2013 \u2727 \u2013\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Echo asks and Tommy answers through gritted teeth,\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know where else to go.\u201d\nHis hands are shaking, pressed against the bullet wound in his side. Blood weeps through his fingers like a grieving lover, like there is a loss to be mourned, but it\u2019s only Tommy. It\u2019s only Tommy who was slow enough, stupid enough to get himself shot on a routine patrol by a kid more scared than he was.\n\u201cShit, you\u2019re bleeding. How did you even get here?! This is a  secret base-\u201d\nGod, he wishes the world would stop spinning so fast for just a  minute, so he could think straight. As it is, he can\u2019t seem to organize his words enough to get them out of his mouth. He manages to open it, but then the world tips sharply and somebody turns off all the lights.\nWhen he opens his eyes, Echo\u2019s looking down at him, soft concern painted over his features. His suit jacket is pressed against Tommy\u2019s middle.\n\u201cHey there,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cHe\u2019s awake.\u201d\nTommy\u2019s fifteen and he finds himself in the midst of the most notorious villains in the world because they\u2019re safer than going back to his mentor. Tommy\u2019s fifteen and a hero and he\u2019s hurt and scared and this is where he ran.\n\u00a0\n\u2013 \u2727 \u2013\n\u00a0\nTommy\u2019s going to be sick. He knew, he  knew  Dream had plans, knew that he would want more eventually, that the excuses wouldn\u2019t work forever.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to call them,\u201d Dream says again, \u201cand ask for help.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if they don\u2019t come?\u201d Tommy tries.\nDream smiles, cold and cruel. \u201cYou\u2019ll make them. I\u2019m sure you can come up with something to convince them. If you don\u2019t,\u201d he trails off, threat clear.\nAnd Tommy, he considers it, considers how bad it would be. It wouldn\u2019t be the first punishment he\u2019s taken for the Syndicate, but he- he\u2019s  scared.\n\u201cAre you going to kill them?\u201d\nDream sighs. \u201cThey\u2019re  villains, Tommy.\u201d\n\u201cBut,\u201d he tries.\n\u201cTommy.\u201d And Tommy\u2019s mouth clicks shut. \u201cMake the call.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u2013 \u2727 \u2013\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to come,\u201d he chokes out, pathetic and childish and  terrified. He shoves fruitlessly at the man\u2019s chest. \u201cYou weren\u2019t-  please, you have to go.\u201d\nThe Angel goes to his knees in front of him, catching his wrists where he\u2019s still fighting. \u201cTommy, Tommy, it\u2019s okay, it\u2019s alright. I know, I know.\u201d\n\u201cYou have to go,\u201d he pleads, begs, tears slipping down his cheeks. The Angel wipes them away, and fuck, Tommy\u2019s not even wearing his  mask, but then neither is the villain, blue eyes far more gentle than he deserves. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says again and again, \u201cI\u2019m  sorry.\u201d\nHe\u2019s pulled into a hug and he breaks, shattering in the Angel\u2019s careful hold. Tears stain green silk.\n\u201cBreathe,\u201d he soothes. \u201cYou did so well. It\u2019s gonna be okay, Toms.\u201d The Angel presses a kiss to his hair, murmuring, \u201cI\u2019m so proud of you.\u201d\nWhen Dream comes, the Angel moves to keep Tommy behind him.\n\u00a0\n\u2013 \u2727 \u2013\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s over a year later when Tommy finds himself sitting with his legs dangling over the edge of a fire escape as he watches the sun set.\n\u201cPenny for your thoughts?\u201d\nWilbur plops down next to him, bumping their shoulders together. Tommy grins back at his brother.\n\u201cFuck you, no, my thoughts are worth  way  more than just a penny.\u201d\nHe laughs loud and bright, head thrown back, and Tommy feels pride burn like the sun in his chest. It\u2019s golden and warm and Tommy could live in the moment forever.\n\u201cYou\u2019re so right, Toms. I\u2019ll be sure to rob a bank tomorrow, so next time I can afford to hear your wisdom.\u201d\nTommy splutters. \u201cWhat- no, Wil,  no. I have a maths test tomorrow, I can\u2019t deal with a bank robbery!\u201d\n\u00a0\nIn the end, Tommy thinks, it was inevitable.\nThey were never going to be able to keep this up, not really. No matter how much they fought, no matter how secret they kept their identities, someone was always going to find the connection, exploit the weakness in the previously invulnerable armor.\nThe Syndicate had a fourth\u2014a too-skinny hero with a loud mouth and a distinct lack of self preservation instincts. No one wants to fuck with the Syndicate, with their expensive suits and high tech gear. Plenty of people are willing to fuck with Tommy though, Tommy in his ratty old red hoodie and ripped up jeans.\n(His trainers are new though and now he\u2019s got a lightweight bulletproof vest on under the hoodie, courtesy of his very panicked family when they realized he was running around in nothing more than a cotton-polyester blend.)\nAnd they try, they really do, but they have dangerous jobs and, well, there\u2019s only so much they can do.\n\u00a0\n\u2013 \u2727 \u2013\n\u00a0\nHe should have known, really, that his night was gonna be shitty when the rain started. Ominous grey clouds have been hanging threateningly overhead all day, but it doesn\u2019t break until about halfway through Tommy\u2019s normal patrol. It goes from a light sprinkle to a straight fucking downpour in minutes and Tommy is soaked through before he can even think about ditching for the night and hopping on the first bus home.\nAnd then he should have known better than to follow the sound of crime into a dark alley especially considering that his powers don\u2019t work in the rain, but he does anyway.\n\u201cHey, boys,\u201d Tommy says brightly, causing the men to whip around to face him. \u201cLovely night for loitering in dark alleys, innit?\u201d\nThe men exchange looks, something predatory and pleased passing between them that makes Tommy\u2019s stomach twist. \u201cThis him?\u201d one of them asks, and the other two nod.\nA nervous laugh escapes him as he steps back. \u201cDid you guys want an autograph? I left my pen at home, but-\u201d\nA chill runs up his spine and he stops dead, dread pooling heavy and cold in his gut. Someone laughs, dark and cruel, behind him.\n\n Fuck. \n\nTommy tries to light a spark, flames flickering out in the downpour. He\u2019s fucked. He\u2019s  so  fucked.\nHe glances over his shoulder to find two more grunts blocking him in. Behind them, there\u2019s a sixth guy in a suit, watching with something dark glinting in his eyes.\n\u201cFive against one? Really?\u201d Tommy laughs again, high and scared. \u201cHardly seems fair, men.\u201d\n\u201cDo you ever stop talking?\u201d the one in the middle asks, grinning in a way that makes Tommy want to  run run run.\nThere\u2019s no way out of this. He can\u2019t even fight them.\nHe grins, all false bravado. \u201cNot really, no.\u201d\nSomeone grabs him and he slams an elbow back into their gut, knocking the breath out of the man and making him let go. His fire flares up when the second comes at him, but the flames hardly even touch the guy before the rain suffocates them.\nHands close around his shoulders and he wrenches free, only to stumble forward into another one\u2019s grasp. He jerks back again, but there are hands there too. Tommy screams, thrashing wildly, but then a cloth covers his mouth, smelling sharp like chemicals and he\u2019s gasping before he can remember to hold his breath.\nThe world swims.\nTommy blinks, but when he tries to open his eyes again they\u2019re heavy and his mouth is dry, his throat clicking when he swallows. He pries them open to find darkness again and it takes too many seconds for him to realize there\u2019s a bag over his head. There are voices somewhere nearby, but not close enough to make out what\u2019s being said.\nIt doesn\u2019t help that his head is swimming and he can\u2019t understand how he ended up in an uncomfortable metal chair when he was in an alley just moments ago. He tries to move his hands, to reach up and pull the bag off his head, but there\u2019s something holding them to the arms of the chair.\nThe voices get closer and his pulse spikes when he hears the same laughter as before. A door opens to his left and he shakes his head, trying to bring himself out of the fog. He\u2019s not safe here. He\u2019s not safe. No one knows where he is and he\u2019s tied down and they fucking  drugged him.\n\u201cHe\u2019s awake,\u201d someone says and Tommy growls behind the fabric before it\u2019s ripped off his head. He glares at the men, trying not to squint at the dim light or blink too rapidly as he clears his vision. Weakness is a death sentence here, so Tommy does everything he can to cling to the illusion of strength.\nThe men are all grinning, sly cruel things that make anxiety prick under Tommy\u2019s skin. His head has cleared and the pieces are falling into place in a way he really,  really  doesn\u2019t like.\nThere are metal cuffs holding his arms to the chair, and the realization hits him like a train that they prepared this, they went after him specifically and made sure they could hold him. The floor under the chair is concrete and the walls are cinder block\u2014probably an abandoned warehouse then, stereotypical, but effective. One of the grunts is holding a bright red fire extinguisher and Tommy glares harder.\n\u201cWhat do you fuckers want?\u201d he spits, furious and hiding behind it.\nThe man laughs again, and Tommy focuses his glare on him. Based on the cocky sureness of his stance and the ridiculous suit, he\u2019s the one in charge. \u201cFiesty one, huh?\u201d he asks, looking at his stupid friends who all snicker. \u201cWe\u2019ll get to that, don\u2019t worry. First, though, I thought we could get to know each other better.\u201d He snaps his fingers like a bitch and another chair appears, and then Bitch Man is sitting with his legs crossed, staring down his nose at Tommy. Another grunt moves forward when he snaps again, but this guy is coming at Tommy and ignoring the warning sparking across the backs of his hands.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you fucking-\u201d Tommy starts, but he\u2019s ignored and then his mask is being pulled off, exposing his face, his identity to these people and he  clings  to his bravado, but terror is striking ice cold through him. \u201cThat\u2019s so rude,\u201d he says, praying that his voice doesn\u2019t shake. \u201cBoundaries and shit, man. Not even villains take off people\u2019s fuckin masks.\u201d\nThe man just laughs, leaning back in his stupid chair, and grinning wide. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen my face, kid, it only seems fair.\u201d He leans forward again, cocking his head with sharp teeth. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve gotten more  personal,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019d like for you to tell us about the Syndicate.\u201d\nTommy goes cold. For the first time in a very long time, Tommy is breathlessly grateful that Dream trained him because he doesn\u2019t react outwardly and he knows it. How many times had he stared down venomous green eyes and  lied  for these people?\nBut what scares him, what  really  scares him is how these people know there\u2019s a connection.\nHe blinks, letting confusion bleed into his expression. \u201cThe what?\u201d\nBitch Man shakes his head, a little disappointed, and reaches into his jacket before setting a gun on his knee. \u201cThe Syndicate,\u201d he repeats and Tommy swallows.\n\u201cRight, the Syndicate. The, uh- well, it\u2019s a villain group, innit? Not exactly very open to sharing. I\u2019ve fought them a few times, but, really, it was less of a fight, more they batted me to the side \u2018cause I wasn\u2019t much of a threat. You\u2019d probably do better reading the wikipedia page.\u201d\nBitch Man nods at a grunt who hands him a tablet. He taps at the screen for a moment before turning it around to face Tommy, who pales.\nIt\u2019s a video, CCTV probably given the mediocre quality and lack of sound, but it doesn\u2019t need it to get the point across perfectly. On the screen is Tommy, pinned to a wall by a low tier criminal who had his hand around Tommy\u2019s throat. The grip was unrelenting, no matter how hard Tommy fought to get free. He remembers that moment, remembers being panicked and desperate, trying to yell for help, but unable to take in a breath. And he remembers what happened next: Technoblade, in his full costume, tearing the guy off of Tommy and slamming his face into the opposite wall once, twice, three times before his skull gave and then a fourth that left brain matter on the bricks. He watches himself on the ground gasping for air and he watches as his brother  kneels  for him, in front of him, checking him over so,  so  gently, tenderly.\nSeeing it again makes his chest ache.\nThe video stops. Tommy glares at the man, who just grins, pleased with the unfiltered reaction he finally got out of him. The confirmation of what he already knew.\n\u201cThat didn\u2019t look much like batting you away, now, did it?\u201d He passes the tablet off and leans in close enough that Tommy can smell the cigarettes on his breath. \u201cSo I\u2019m gonna ask again: what do you know about the Syndicate?\u201d\nTommy spits in his face and when the back of a hand cracks across his own, he doesn\u2019t even regret it. There\u2019s blood in his mouth now, but no loose teeth, so he bares them, stained faintly crimson, and says, \u201cIs that all you got, bitch?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m a civil man,\u201d he says, his voice carefully controlled rage. \u201cBut I always get what I want, kid. And  what I want  is information on your little  family. You\u2019re gonna tell me everything you know in the end, but it\u2019s up to you how painful that\u2019s gonna be, understand?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not telling you shit,\u201d Tommy says and he laughs. \u201cYou think  you  scare me? I was trained by  Dream.\u201d\nBitch Man leans in again, closer this time. \u201cWhatever you  think  you know about pain,\u201d he hisses, \u201cis  nothing  compared to what I\u2019m capable of.\u201d\n Sure, Tommy thinks, grinning with all the stupid cocky sureness of his hero persona.  You can try. \nAnd then Bitch Man is standing and pain cracks like lightning and the world tilts dangerously. The sound of the metal chair landing on the cement floor rings out through the empty room and drilling into Tommy\u2019s pounding skull. Something wet trickles down his temple and he blinks away the spots in his vision to see Bitch Man standing over him and his fallen chair with the gun gripped in his hand from where he\u2019d fucking pistol whipped Tommy. He\u2019s dizzy like he has a concussion and he\u2019s not sure what caused it\u2014getting hit with the gun or falling wrong when the chair tipped.\nHe glares, spits again, this time at Bitch Man\u2019s shoes, and says, \u201cFuck you.\u201d\nThat\u2019s when the first kick lands to his ribs and Tommy recognizes the steel toe a little more intimately than he would like. Who the  fuck  makes steel toe dress shoes? What the  fuck.\nThe blows land again and again as the man asks question after question that Tommy refuses to even fucking acknowledge. He won\u2019t throw his family to the wolves, not with everything he owes them and not with the knowledge none of them would ever cash that in. He loves them and he trusts them and he  knows  that they would want him to do whatever it took to save himself, that they would do  whatever it took  to protect him.\nHe could give these men everything, but he won\u2019t. He won\u2019t say a goddamn word because they wouldn\u2019t if the roles were reversed and Tommy gives what he\u2019s given. He is  loyal  and he  loves them, so he laughs and feels the moment something in his chest  cracks  and he keeps his mouth shut.\n\u201cWhat are their names?\u201d the man asks, gripping Tommy\u2019s hair in a fist and forcing him to meet his eyes. Tommy wheezes, grinning, blood covering the lower half of his face from where his nose had been broken and he\u2019d bitten his tongue.\n\u201cBitch,\u201d he says, tasting iron and reveling in the frustration in his eyes.\nAnd then the world explodes in a cacophony of sound, screams and gunfire ricocheting off the walls. Bitch Man drops Tommy\u2019s head and he groans when it hits the unforgiving ground again, but he isn\u2019t scared anymore, he isn\u2019t because there\u2019s yelling and it\u2019s familiar in the way that means safety. He breathes, in and out, as deep as he can without too much protest from his ribs. He breathes and he waits for his family to finish cleaning up and take him home.\nWilbur reaches him first, gentle fingers carding through his hair and a soft hurt noise escaping him as he looks over Tommy\u2019s face. \u201cOh, sunshine, what did they do to you,\u201d he murmurs and Tommy squeezes his eyes shut, tears slipping down his face for the first time that night.\n\u201cWil,\u201d he pleads, and cool hands are on his cheeks, thumbs wiping away his tears. \u201cWil.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re okay,\u201d Wilbur soothes. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, you\u2019re okay, Toms. I\u2019m so sorry we took so long.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t tell them anything. I didn\u2019t tell him  anything.\u201d\nAnd then Techno is there, snapping off the cuffs and carefully pulling Tommy up into his arms, holding him as tightly as he dared, before pulling back to check him over. Fury lights a fire in his eyes as he takes in the bruises on Tommy\u2019s face and the blood drying all the way down his chin to the collar of his shirt, the plain white one they\u2019d left him in after stripping off his gear somewhere between the alley and the warehouse. Techno growls and Wilbur hisses when he lifts the edge of it to find the red and purple mess already coloring his side.\n\u201cYou should\u2019ve given them whatever they asked for, Tommy. Nothing was worth  this.\u201d There\u2019s something a little desperate in Wilbur\u2019s voice, and Tommy recognizes it from the other times they\u2019ve had this conversation:  it\u2019s not your job to protect us, so let us protect you.\nBut love goes both ways, and Tommy\u2019s not  Dream, he\u2019s not going to  take  and never  give.\nExcept he doesn\u2019t know how to say that in a way that won\u2019t put that cold anger on their faces that means they\u2019ve stopped listening to him with any real consideration and have switched into Wishing They Could Kill Dream Again mode. So he just shakes his head and says, \u201cYou would do it for me.\u201d\nWilbur laughs, wetly, exasperated, and presses a kiss to Tommy\u2019s forehead. \u201cThat\u2019s really sweet, but we definitely need to work on that.\u201d\n\u201cCan we work on never letting him get kidnapped again?\u201d Techno grumbles.\n\u201cWe can start,\u201d Phil says, something dark and furious in his voice, \u201cby sending a message.\u201d He tilts his head, watching with a dangerous sort of curiosity as Bitch Man starts to beg.\nHe\u2019s on his knees, shaking and powerless and so unlike the big bad who had everything under his control just moments before. Tommy doesn\u2019t grin because he\u2019s a  hero  and his family doesn\u2019t need to be encouraged, but there\u2019s satisfaction settling comfortably in his chest as he watches the man crumble.\n\u201cYou need me,\u201d he says, words tripping over themselves to be heard. \u201cYou need me. To send a message, you need me alive. I\u2019ll tell them, tell them that you claimed the little hero. That he\u2019s not to be touched. I\u2019ll, I\u2019ll-\u201d\nPhilza lowers himself down to meet the man\u2019s eyes. He\u2019s grinning something dark and predatory. The man pales. \u201cYou\u2019ll  what?\u201d he asks, mockery dripping heavy from his voice. \u201cYou\u2019ll be  good? You\u2019ll roll over like a dog and  obey?\u201d\nThe man nods, frantic, and, after a moment of consideration, Philza reaches into the man\u2019s coat for his gun. As he stands, he checks the safety and that it\u2019s loaded with practiced ease.\n\u201cYou were right,\u201d he says and it\u2019s almost,  almost  genuine. \u201cI do need you to deliver a message.\u201d\nTommy doesn\u2019t flinch when the final shot rings out and his eyes don\u2019t linger on the body for more than the second it takes to see that he\u2019s not breathing. Instead, his gaze lands on his father, on the way his face softens as he kneels in front of Tommy, fingers tracing the same pattern as Wilbur\u2019s, running barely there over the scrapes and bruises before cupping his cheeks. He says Tommy\u2019s name like a prayer, like something precious and good and holy, and he rests their foreheads together for a long moment before pulling carefully away.\nHe breathes once, twice, and then he breaks, whining-pleading-begging, \u201cDad,\u201d and Phil makes a choked off shattered sound as he pulls him into his chest. Tommy\u2019s head slots perfectly under his chin like he was made to be there or Phil was made to hold him or they were all four carved from the same stone. Tommy shudders and  clings  and Phil  holds him.\nPhil just holds him, and Tommy thinks, if he asked, Phil would hold him forever.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go home,\u201d Phil says softly. And home is here, in arms that hold and protect and carry him, but home is a kitchen table, too, it is a couch that shouldn\u2019t fit four, but does anyway. Home is warm milk and it\u2019s chicken soup and it\u2019s pancakes in the middle of the afternoon.\nThey go home. Nothing changes and nothing is the same. It\u2019s complicated and it\u2019s difficult, but they go home. They are together and they always go home.\n\u00a0"
