    "text": "\u00a0\nThe most painful part of war is the waiting. They\u2019ve taken Azula down, but they don\u2019t know if Ozai still lives, or if the Earth Kingdom has been burnt to ash. They won the Agni Kai, but the war still wages beyond the palace. No one knows what has happened in this courtyard.\nKatara\u2019s hands are pressed against his wound. He tries to grasp her wrist. \u201cKatara,\u201d he says, \u201cI have to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou have to stay still and let me heal you.\u201d It comes out sharper than she intended. She sniffles. \u201cYou could\u2019ve\u2014Zuko.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t, though,\u201d Zuko says, and he tries for a smile.\nShe smiles back, and it\u2019s watery, her hair hanging in damp clumps around her face, but it makes something unwind in his chest. One of his friends is okay. He doesn\u2019t know about the rest of them, or Uncle, but one of his friends is going to be alright.\nWhen he\u2019s no longer in danger of bleeding out, Katara helps him stand and limp up into a side room. She pushes him onto a singed chaise, and he goes because he is feverish and in pain and he can still hear Azula bellowing fire into the air outside in the courtyard. She will exhaust herself soon, but the sound of her now\u2014it wrenches at something in Zuko\u2019s stomach, below the starfish-shaped wound in his chest.\nKatara fetches bandages, and spare robes, abandoned by a noble spooked by their fight, to throw on over their tattered clothes. She works on his injury until they hear the faint sound of engines.\nKatara pokes her head out of the courtyard. \u201cIt\u2019s an airship. They\u2019re landing just outside the city. \u201d\n\u201cJust the one?\u201d Zuko asks. Katara nods, yes. \u201cWe won. We must have. They wouldn\u2019t be back this soon, and there wouldn\u2019t be only one airship. It has to be Aang.\u201d\nZuko pushes himself up onto his elbows, and Katara frowns at him. The city is quiet outside. The palace is empty, and the people have locked themselves in their homes. The only sound is the faint crackle of still-lit fires and the distant whir of an airship landing.\n\u201cYou\u2019re hurt,\u201d she says. \u201cYou need to rest.\u201d\n\u201cThere are active Fire Nation soldiers all over the world taking advantage of the comet,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cThe rest of the world doesn\u2019t know that the war is over. It isn\u2019t over, technically. The war survived the passing of Sozin and Azulon; it would continue until someone officially put a stop to it.\u201d\n\u201cFine, then, I\u2019ll fetch you parchment, and you can write up letters to the generals here.\u201d\nZuko pushes up off the chaise. Katara\u2019s hands fluttered around him, wanting to push him back down. \u201cA letter from the traitor prince? They wouldn\u2019t listen. It needs to come from the Fire Lord.\u201d\n\u201cYou are the Fire Lord,\u201d Katara says. \u201cWe beat Azula, and Aang has probably beaten Ozai, which means\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo one else knows we won. At this point, people will ignore any order that doesn\u2019t come with the official Fire Lord seal.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Katara says. Her eyes keep flicking to his chest, as though waiting to see fresh blood soak through the bandages, but she's doesn\u2019t stop him from getting up. \u201cHow do we get that seal, then?\u201d\nShe looks around the room as though it\u2019s underneath the kotatsu or the debris scattered over the plush carpet, where the outer wall was burst open by a stray blast. It\u2019s a fine room, a room for lazing nobles. A bowl of raspberries is upturned by the door.\n\u201cI order someone to give it to me when I\u2019m the Fire Lord,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cBut first, I need the Fire Sages to legitimise my claim to the throne.\u201d\nWith Katara steadying him, her arm around his waist, his arm around her shoulders, Zuko manages to walk without listing to one side. Raspberries are squashed under their boots as they head into the palace proper, ground into the carpet like pulpy blood.\nThey find the Fire Sages in the throne room. The Head Sage is still holding the Fire Lord crown.\nThe Head Sage looks Zuko up and down, and purses his lips. \u201cIt is done?\u201d\n\u201cAzula broke the Agni Kai,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cShe went after my second, and Katara took her down.\u201d\nZuko had given Katara a brief run down on Agni Kais on their way over. It\u2019s considered dishonourable for participants of the Agni Kai to go after anyone other than their opponent. These are considered \u201cbroken\u201d Agni Kais. Technically still legitimate, but dishonourable.\nZuko hadn\u2019t named Katara his second, not out loud, but they all understood that she was. If a bender was hurt in an Agni Kai in a way that didn\u2019t necessarily mean defeat, their second could continue the fight in their place. This tradition came to being centuries ago, back when Agni Kais\u00a0were death matches. Clean, unquestionable kills were preferable. If your opponent broke their arm, you would rather their second step in, instead of being known for killing someone who was weak with pain and unable to bend properly.\nIt\u2019s an old tradition. Nowadays, firebenders don\u2019t mind killing or maiming their opponent when they\u2019re injured and unable to fight back. They prefer it, even. But it\u2019s a tradition that still stands.\nThe Head Sage\u2019s gaze lands on Katara, and for a moment, Zuko thinks he is about to dismiss her as his second due to the blue peaking out beneath her robe, but then the Head Sage nods. Only a firebender can enter into an Agni Kai, but there are no such rules about who their second is.\n\u201cCan you take us to her corpse?\u201d asks the Head Sage.\n\u201cShe\u2019s alive,\u201d Zuko says quickly. \u201cShe\u2019s chained in a palace courtyard, where the Agni Kai took place. She\u2019s incoherent.\u201d\n\u201cWe will need to see,\u201d he says. He gestures for the Sages behind him to follow Katara out into the courtyard.\nWithout Katara by his side, Zuko feels the full weight of his exhaustion. The Head Sage eyes Zuko up and down\u2014not like he\u2019s judging his ragged appearance, but like he\u2019s making a list in his head of all the things to be done. A proper coronation will take place later in the week.\nIf, of course, Ozai is dead. If Aang goes down, and Ozai is the one that comes back and finds Azula chained down and Zuko trying to claim the throne\u2014he\u2019ll kill all three of him. Zuko and Katara for winning, and Azula for daring to lose.\nThe Sages return, murmuring to one another, and Katara slots herself back under Zuko\u2019s arm, taking his weight. She ignores him when he tries to tell her that he\u2019s fine.\nThere are no guards to stop Aang and the others from marching into the throne room. The palace is deserted, like the Day of Black Sun.\nAang walks in first, exhausted and coated in a layer of grime. His clothes are tattered. He\u2019s bleeding in places. His hand is out, and it takes a moment for Zuko to realise what he\u2019s seeing\u2014Ozai, eyes glazed, barely conscious, with his hands bound in front of him with rock.\nHe seems \u2026 smaller. It\u2019s the only word Zuko can think to apply to this man\u2014this painfully human man. His father has always been big. Zuko is used to looking up at him from a kneeling position on the floor, or from a child\u2019s height, before his banishment.\nNow, though, Ozai doesn\u2019t make him feel small. Zuko looks down at the sick, oily-haired man and feels\u2014\nRelief. And then relief that he feels relieved. A part of him had expected to feel the way he had when he stood in front of Uncle\u2019s cell, but he doesn\u2019t.\nToph, Sokka, and Suki come next. Sokka is hopping. Suki is supporting his weight. Aside from his leg, none of them look badly hurt.\nThey see each other across the throne room and they all pause there, swallowed up with the realisation that they\u2019ve both won, that Ozai and Azula have been taken down, the Fire Nation is theirs and no one is dead. They might have run and tackled each other if Sokka\u2019s leg wasn\u2019t broken, and Katara wasn\u2019t supporting Zuko\u2019s weight, and Aang wasn\u2019t standing in front of the Fire Sages with Ozai.\n\u201cI am Avatar Aang,\u201d he says in a strange and echoey voice, \u201cand I am here to revoke Fire Lord Ozai\u2019s right to rule.\u201d\nAang keeps going. This words are ancient and instinctual, like his connection to the spiritual world, pulled from somewhere deep inside of him. No one taught him these words. If asked to repeat them again in a week, he wouldn\u2019t be able to.\nWhen Aang is finished, it is Zuko\u2019s turn. He pulls away from Katara, makes himself stand straight. His hands fumble for the silk ties around his waist. The borrowed robe is for lounging in, something baby skin soft that nobles throw on over their sleeping clothes. It\u2019s not the armour Zuko imagined wearing when the war\u2019s climax came, or the elaborate robes he pictured for his coronation.\nThe Fire Sages hurry through their own vows. Zuko signs a handful of old papers and the Sages whisk them away before the ink has dried.\nAnd then, a few minutes after Aang\u2019s ancient words stripped his father of his power, two hours after Azula was almost crowned, Zuko is the regent Fire Lord. With a simple command, one of the Fire Sages hands him the official seal. The seal that will stop an army.\nThere\u2019s a feeling in his chest, too big to give name to. Zuko gives himself a moment to take in the bowed heads of the Fire Sages, the cloying incense thick in the air, the tired, accomplished smiles on the faces of his bloodied friends, before he retightens the sash of his robe, and says, \u201cOkay. Let\u2019s go.\u201d\nZuko doesn\u2019t spare Ozai a second glance. He won\u2019t stay here and try and put into words all the things he wants to say to this father. He doesn\u2019t have the time for that; he has a war to end.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFive weeks later\n\u00a0\nEarth Kingdom soldiers meet them at the wall. They look at Zuko with poorly disguised disgust. Zuko pushes down his temper. He can\u2019t blame them for their animosity, not really. The previous Firelord wouldn\u2019t have stepped foot in Ba Sing Se unless it was to personally burn it to the ground, and the last time Zuko was there, he helped Azula seize control.\nZuko is flanked by a handful of royal guards. The tension between them and the Earth Kingdom soldiers is palpable. Zuko resists the urge to fidget. Fire Lord\u2019s shouldn\u2019t fidget.\nAnd then Aang is whizzing down the steps and barrelling into him. His feet leave the ground, and he thinks Aang\u2019s hug sends them a metre into the air, but he\u2019s too busy scrambling to grab hold of the sunset orange robes to actually check how high Aang propels them.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Aang says when they\u2019re back on solid ground again. \u201cI got too excited. It\u2019s been ages!\u201d\nBehind Zuko\u2019s back, his guards look at each other, as if wondering if they should have done something to stop their Firelord from being tackle-hugged by an over-exuberant teenager. But Aang is the Avatar and a famous friend of Zuko\u2019s, and he\u2019s been to the palace before. They\u2019ve probably seen Aang do this sometime during his two week stay at the palace.\n\u201cIt\u2019s only been three weeks,\u201d Zuko says.\n\u201cAges,\u201d Aang stresses.\nZuko thinks Aang would have swept him up into another hug if he could, but the others push him out of the way. Katara\u2019s hug is much gentler than Aang\u2019s. Toph socks him in the arm in greeting. He feels the force of it even though he\u2019s wearing armour. When he looks down, he sees a noticeable dent in the metal plating.\n\u201cToph,\u201d Zuko says.\nShe blinks at him innocently. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cFix my armour.\u201d\nShe blows her bangs out of her face, and says, \u201cPansy.\u201d\nShe does fix his armour and even pulls him into a hug too, so he lets the insult go. Sokka hugs him next. When he pulls away, Suki steps forward to offer her own hug.\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard some of what you\u2019re trying to do in the Fire Nation,\u201d she says. \u201cTy Lee won\u2019t stop talking about it. She\u2019s proud of you, and I think she feels a little guilty for her place in the war.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all done things we regret.\u201d Zuko doesn\u2019t look at her when he says this.\nSuki squeezes his arm. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you, too. You\u2019re doing a good thing\u2014for your nation, and for the world.\u201d\nSome of the tension leeches out of Zuko. His friends are behind her, smiling and looking so at ease now that their little group is all in one place, and it feels strangely normal being in Ba Sing Se as both the Fire Lord and a member of this group of friends.\nSomeone clears his throat. The Earth Kingdom soldiers are still standing there.\n\u201cMy apologies,\u201d Zuko says, stepping away from Suki. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLeaders from all over the globe are pouring into Ba Sing Se for the following week of peace talks. Tonight, there will be a grand ball in the palace to welcome them. Zuko doesn\u2019t head to the palace right away, though.\nIt\u2019s not that Zuko thinks he won\u2019t be welcome. It\u2019s only been a month since his coronation, but Zuko has already been in contact with foreign dignitaries\u2014namely, King Kuuei and Chief Hakoda, who speak on behalf of their nations\u2014and it has been going surprisingly smoothly. But Zuko is sixteen, and tired after spending weeks talking with (and replacing) the government that just lost the century-long war, and he misses his friends.\nUncle is waiting for him in the foyer of Aang\u2019s apartment, and Zuko forgets about everyone else. He drops his bag, and pushes past Sokka, and then tackles Uncle in a hug. Uncle hugs back, just as fiercely.\nBehind him, Sokka picks Zuko\u2019s bag up and sneaks around them to put it in Zuko\u2019s room. Aang thanks his guards and sends them up to the palace, where Zuko will meet with them this evening. The guards go easily. Anyone that wants to harm Zuko will have to go through the Avatar, two of his masters, the leader of the Kyoshi Warriors, a Water Tribe warrior, and Uncle. Here, Zuko is safer than he\u2019s been in months.\nZuko finally pulls away. He tries to discretely wipe at his face so no one will notice how wet his cheeks have become. Uncle rubs at his eyes, too.\n\u201cLook at you,\u201d Uncle says, holding him out at arms length. \u201cYou look so striking, nephew.\u201d\n\u201cUncle,\u201d Zuko says, ducking his head. \u201cYou saw me at my coronation.\u201d\n\"That was a month ago! Your hair has gotten longer. It looks good like this.\u201d\n\u201cI want to grow it out,\u201d Zuko confesses. \u201cI know most Fire Lords grow their hair out, but \u2026\u201d\nUncle knows what Zuko means before he has even said it. \u201cYou will not look like your father. With long hair and your own budding grace, you will look like your mother.\u201d\nWithout thinking about it, Zuko pushes back into Uncle\u2019s arms and presses his face into his shoulder. He doesn\u2019t initiate hugs often. But Uncle doesn\u2019t push him away. He cups a hand to the back of Zuko\u2019s neck, where his hair has begun to unravel. Zuko closes his eyes against the touch.\nThe others quietly move deeper into the house, giving them their privacy. Zuko barely hears them go.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNo other nation has just one leader. The Earth Kingdom is separated into territories ruled by various kings, governors, and mayors with the Earth King at the nation\u2019s head. There are two Water Tribes, each with an individual chief. The Air Nomads were a theocracy and had four separate councils.\nThe Fire Nation has one leader. One Fire Lord. One Zuko.\nZuko has never felt this as keenly as he does in the halls of Ba Sing Se. It\u2019s not just heads of state here today. There are the uppermost noblemen and women of the Earth Kingdom, senior warriors from the Water Tribes, the Kyoshi Warriors, venerated war heroes, and the Avatar and his friends.\nZuko could have brought his minsters of his own, but it would have felt too much like bringing a murderer to a funeral, and so Zuko is the only blot of red in the crowded ballroom, save for his guards, standing by the door.\nUncle is here, but he\u2019s wearing Earth Kingdom greens. There is a danger that, if he were to dress in royal Fire Nation red, the officials would flock to him to talk politics instead of going to Zuko. He doesn\u2019t wear the Fire Lord crown, but he is older and better tempered. Some people resent doing business with a teenager. With a traitor.\nAgainst the pale greens of the ballroom, Zuko\u2019s crimson robes seem that much darker. The blue of the Water Tribe and Aang\u2019s soft orange robes seem to compliment the green of the Earth Kingdom, but Zuko and his guard\u2019s dark reds stand out like a thundercloud in the spring sky.\nZuko isn\u2019t alone, though. He has friends here. Allies.\nEven if it doesn\u2019t feel like it.\n\u201cThe Fire Lord hasn\u2019t stepped foot in the Earth Kingdom in over a century.\u201d\nGovernor Situ is a small man that hails from a decent-sized city near the coast. The Fire Nation navy had only needed to sail across the sea dividing their countries and march a few miles inland before reaching the relatively undefended city.\nZuko had been introduced man from earlier, when Bosco had spent half an hour cuddling up to Zuko, enjoying the natural heat that firebenders' produced. King Kuuei had stood by beaming, and keeping Zuko and his bear company, and introducing Zuko to all the officials that passed by. Zuko has read about Governor Situ\u2019s city in reports, too. There had been casualties on both sides, but the massive devastation wrought to the once-great city is nothing compared to the handful of inexperienced soldiers lost in combat.\n\u201cI know,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cThis is a time for change. For peace.\u201d\nThey\u2019re near the windows. Zuko had gravitated to this space when he had started to get overwhelmed after two hours of mingling with tense dignitaries. The Earth Kingdom air is familiar in its own way, even if the breeze wafting through the palace windows lacks the dirt and sweat Zuko remembers from the lower levels, back when he was a refugee.\n\u201cChange,\u201d repeats Governor Situ. \u201cI heard you earlier, welcoming the Water Tribe chiefs, apologising to the men who were once held prisoner by your own country. Honeyed words.\u201d\nZuko looks behind him, but he doesn\u2019t see any friends in immediate view. Flagging down Uncle or Aang from across the ballroom would be too conspicuous.\n\u201cI meant what I said,\u201d Zuko says.\n\u201cMaybe, but don\u2019t forget who you are. I know you have no real power. One day, your people will rise up and place someone else, someone stronger and just as poisonous as your father, back on the throne.\u201d\nZuko swallows. He can feel his fire at the base of his throat. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re babying them,\u201d Governor Situ says. \u201cIf an armadillo lion bites you, you don\u2019t clean its teeth and sing it to sleep.\u201d\n\u201cMy people were damaged by the war, too,\u201d says Zuko, \u201ceven if it was in a different way than the rest of the world. I\u2019m doing what\u2019s best for them. They\u2019ll see that soon.\u201d\n\u201cWill they?\u201d The governor swirls his goblet of wine. He looks almost bored, Zuko thinks, like talking with the Fire Lord in-person\u2014something no Earth Kingdom official has done in a century\u2014is an everyday chore. \u201cYou sound very sure of yourself. But then, the General who broke down my gates and murdered scores of my people seemed very sure that what she was doing was right. Your father was very sure of himself until the Avatar had him on his knees, unable to even bend. And your sister was sure, too, wasn\u2019t she? Before she cracked.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it that you want?\u201d Zuko says through his teeth.\n\u201cThis can\u2019t last. Your people will rise up, or an assassin will come for you in the dead of the night, or you will make a wrong decision and the Avatar will topple you, the way he toppled your father. Ozai was only on the throne for six years. Your sister was cut down before she was even crowned. How long do you think you\u2019ll get, boy-king?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t call me that,\u201d Zuko says. His temper is rising to the surface. He\u2019s done so well to keep it down in public these past few months. He thought his days of throwing hissing fits on the sun-baked deck of his ship were beyond him, but if this governor keeps talking, keeps trying to bait him, then\u2014\n\u201cBoy-king?\u201d Governor Situ repeats. Zuko can feel the fire building beneath his skin, rising up behind his teeth. He can taste sparks on his tongue. \u201cYou\u2019re not even eighteen. How can you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cZuko, there you are!\u201d Sokka cuts in, latching onto his arm. \u201cWe\u2019ve been looking for you.\u201d\nToph pushes up under Zuko\u2019s other arm. \u201cWe\u2019ll be kidnapping the Fire Lord, now,\u201d she tells Governor Situ.\n\u201cOur good friend the Fire Lord,\u201d Sokka corrects.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Toph says, \u201cour good friend the Fire Lord.\u201d\nToph grins, and it\u2019s that feral, toothy smile that\u2019s too big for her face, the kind of smile she pulls out right before especially painful training sessions. She stomps one foot, just because she can, and this corner of the ballroom shutters beneath them. Governor Situ steadies himself with one hand on the wall.\nEven if he doesn\u2019t recognise Sokka as a war hero and the eldest son of Chief Hakoda, Governor Situ has to recognise Toph as the Avatar\u2019s earthbending teacher. In most areas of the world, the Avatar\u2019s four masters are considered to be the best benders of their nation. The most honoured benders. Zuko thinks that\u2019s at least true for Toph and Katara, even if it\u2019s not true for him.\n\u201cLady Beifong,\u201d Governor Situ says. \u201cAn honour to meet you in person.\u201d\nSokka coughs into his hand. Governor Situ offers him a curt bow, too, and says, \u201cAnd you, Sokka of the Southern Water Tribe.\u201d\nSokka can\u2019t help but look pleased at being recognised, even if he doesn\u2019t return the governor\u2019s bow. Toph slots herself more securely against Zuko\u2019s side.\n\u201cNow that you\u2019re done antagonising a war hero,\u201d Toph says, \u201cwe\u2019ll be going now. Later.\u201d\nGovernor Situ opens his mouth, but Toph wraps an arm around Zuko\u2019s waist and manhandles him away from the governor. Sokka clutches at his other arm and scrambles to catch up.\n\u201cBye!\u201d Sokka throws over his shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t talk to Zuko ever again!\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s a governor from an important Earth Kingdom city,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell him to stay away from me. You shouldn\u2019t be telling anyone to stay away from me.\u201d\n\u201cSure we can,\u201d Toph says with that same menacing smile.\nSokka snags a green-coloured cocktail from a passing table. Zuko thinks it belongs to one of Situ\u2019s fellow governors that are hovering a few feet away, watching their six-legged progression with raised eyebrows. The Earth Kingdom hasn\u2019t been visited by Fire Nation representatives in decades (not officially, anyway). They\u2019re not used to Zuko\u2019s elaborate crimson robes. They\u2019re also not used to teenagers who have access to monumental power, both politically and physically, manhandling one another and elbowing their way through diplomatic balls.\n\u201cWe can when they\u2019re jerks like that.\u201d Sokka sips at the drink and then purses his lips like he\u2019s sucked on a lemon. He deposits the drink on a random table. \u201cBleugh.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m the Fire Lord,\u201d Zuko begins. Toph nudges a low-ruling king out the way with her hip. Zuko offers the king an apologetic shrug as Toph and Sokka pull him past.\n\u201cZuko, your heart was going crazy,\u201d Toph says. \u201cI could feel it from the other end of the ballroom. Whatever that guy was saying to you, it was bad news.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t threaten every person that makes me nervous.\u201d\nToph ignores that. She and Sokka tug him through the crowd, only stopping at the ballroom exit.\nUncle hands the Fire Nation guards tea. When he sees his nephew, his Fire Lord, being manhandled, he only looks amused.\n\u201cNephew,\u201d Uncle says. \u201cHow has your evening been?\u201d\n\u201cI think it\u2019s about to get a lot worse or a lot better,\u201d Zuko says.\nUncle raises an eyebrow. \u201cOh?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re kidnapping the Fire Lord,\u201d Toph says. Neither Uncle or the guards look alarmed at this proclamation. \u201cYou can have him back sometime tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cTomorrow?\u201d Zuko says, and tries to jerk out of her grip. She holds tight. \u201cI have things to do. People to speak to. I can\u2019t just disappear in the middle of the ball. People will notice and\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHave fun, Fire Lord Zuko,\u201d says Uncle. \u201cYou have done enough. Politics can wait until morning. I will handle any complaints people may have.\u201d\n\u201cUncle\u2014\u201d Zuko begins, because Uncle shouldn\u2019t have to weather the scorn of the Earth Kingdom officials in Zuko\u2019s absence, not when he could be meeting up with old friends and enjoying his tea, not when this is Zuko\u2019s responsibility.\nBut Uncle just waves a hand, and says, \u201cYoung people deserve the time and space to enjoy the springtime that is youth. Enjoy your night.\u201d\n\u201cOh, we will,\u201d Toph says.\nToph tightens her grip on him, and Sokka readjusts their linked arms so Zuko feels like a maiden being escorted home, and together, they bustle him into the outer chamber and through the double doors, into the palace gardens. If the guards posted at the palace exit think it\u2019s strange that an earthbender and a Water Tribe warrior are dragging the Fire Lord around, they don\u2019t say anything.\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Zuko says, almost conversationally, \u201cif we were in the Fire Nation, this might be considered a capital offence.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019d probably still do this if we were in the Fire Nation,\u201d Sokka says.\nToph snorts. \u201cWe\u2019re absolutely going to do this next time we visit you, Sparky.\u201d\n\u201cGood thing you\u2019re the Fire Lord and would stop us from getting arrested.\u201d\nZuko pretends to think this over. \u201cWould I, though?\u201d\nSokka jerks him the last few steps. Zuko trips on the long hem of his robes and collides with Sokka. Only Toph\u2019s grip keeps them from being knocked onto the wet grass.\n\u201cIf you two knock yourself out, I\u2019m not carrying you the rest of the way,\u201d Toph says, hoisting them upright.\nAppa is waiting for them in the manicured gardens, wedged between two flower beds. He\u2019s eating a hydrangea bush. The three people lounging on his back either don\u2019t notice or don\u2019t care that the Earth King\u2019s flowers are being devoured below them.\n\u201cThere better still be wine left,\u201d Sokka calls when they\u2019re in hearing range.\nAang\u2019s head jerks up. He throws himself over the side of Appa and plucks Zuko out of Toph and Sokka\u2019s arms, hugging him like it\u2019s been years since they last met, rather than a handful of hours. \u201cZuko!\u201d\nZuko pats Aang on the back awkwardly. Sokka throws his hands up into the air, and says, \u201cHello to you, too, Aang.\u201d\nAnd then Suki is jumping down from Appa and sweeping Sokka up into a tight hug, nuzzling into the skin beneath his chin. Sokka slackens in her hold.\n\u201cNevermind,\u201d Sokka says into Suki\u2019s hair. \u201cAang, who?\u201d\nKatara follows them down. She hugs Toph, and then, when Aang finally lets go, hugs Zuko. Suki is still holding onto Sokka, so she ignores her brother completely.\n\u201cYou did really good in there,\u201d Katara tells him.\nZuko ducks his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014\u201d\nKatara shakes her head. \u201cYou\u2019re making progress, I can tell, even if it doesn\u2019t feel like it right now.\u201d\nToph socks him in the arm. This time, it\u2019s not hard enough to dent metal. \u201cGood job, Sparky.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d He swallows. A wet badger-frog seems to be caught in his throat. \u201cThank you, guys.\u201d\nSuki finally lets go off Sokka. She swoops in to hug Zuko, and then pulls back and thumps him in the arm, right where Toph had whacked him, hard enough for Zuko to feel it through his thick robes. \u201cYou\u2019re doing amazing, Zuko. Don\u2019t be surprised that the rest of us noticed, too.\u201d\nShe goes to hit him again, but Zuko ducks behind Sokka. \u201cHas Suki gotten more violent? It\u2019s only been a few weeks, what happened?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the wine,\u201d Sokka says. \u201cShe gets fight-y when she drinks.\u201d\n\u201cI could kick your ass,\u201d Suki informs Sokka.\nSokka smiles goofily at her. \u201cI know, babe.\u201d\nThey climb back onto Appa, and someone passes Zuko a heavy water skin. He takes a swig. It\u2019s wine. It\u2019s strong and tastes faintly of berries and mint, and sits warmly in his stomach after only a few mouthfuls. This group has always been affectionate with one another, but the wine explains the intensity of it tonight.\nWill he be like that after drinking wine, too?\nRoyals are usually introduced to sake and spiced wines as they enter their teenage years, but Zuko was exiled at thirteen and then turned traitor at sixteen. He\u2019s only had alcohol a few times.\nHis crew introduced him to overproof rum a few months into his banishment. Zuko, unused to having more than a few sips of Uncle\u2019s wine at dinnertime, downed half a bottle with his face scrunched up, determined not to let the burn of it stop him. The crew laughed when Zuko spent the night throwing up, unable to even walk straight. Or, they had laughed, until Uncle had found him slumped against the ship railing alone, dangerously drunk. Zuko had been too far gone to remember what Uncle said or did when he realised what had happened, but the crew never offered him rum ever again.\nNow, sitting between his friends, equals who he fought and bled beside, he doesn\u2019t feel anything like that thirteen year old boy, choking down rum to the encouraging shouts of strange men. The wine leaves him warm in the chilly evening, and he lets his friend\u2019s laughter wash over him.\nAang settles behind the reins. Appa takes off, and then they\u2019re flying low over Ba Sing Se. Aang laughs and the sound is caught in the wind, trailing back to where his friends are sprawled in the saddle.\n\u201cWait,\u201d Zuko says, \u201chow much has Aang had?\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t think a drunk Avatar crashing his Sky Bison into a building will cause an international incident considering how much political sway Aang carries these days, but he\u2019d rather not traumatise any Earth Kingdom citizens tonight.\n\u201cNot much,\u201d Katara says. \u201cA few mouthfuls. He said since Appa has to stay sober, then he will, too.\u201d\nZuko blinks the image of a drunk Appa out of his eyes. Toph leans across his lap, snags the water skin, and takes a generous gulp. She doesn\u2019t move away afterward, just throws her legs out until her feet are propped in Katara\u2019s lap, and settles in against his side.\n\u201cCan\u2019t you make it a little less cold?\u201d Toph says.\nSokka takes the wine from Toph and waves it around imperiously. \u201cBend, firebender!\u201d\nZuko spent the last weeks of the war lighting campfires and, during cold nights and chilly flights on the back of Appa, radiating heat to keep his newfound friends warm. It would have made Zuko feel used if he hadn't been so touched by the way his warmth made them shuffle closer, made their smiles come a little easier, made Aang see that firebending could be something beautiful and comforting rather than destructive.\nHe breathes in deep and draws his fire up into his chest. Warmth pushes through the air in a wave, and as one, the group sighs and relaxes as if they\u2019re sinking into a hot bath. Toph pushes her face into his shoulder. He can feel the point of her nose above his armpit. Katara edges closer.\n\u201cToph is hogging Zuko,\u201d Sokka complains.\nZuko sighs and holds up his left arm, the arm Toph hasn\u2019t stolen for herself, and Sokka carries Suki over and settles them both against his side. There\u2019s no way Zuko could get up now, not with his friends piled on top of him. His long robes are tangled in their legs. Toph runs her hands down the bottom of the skirt, where the velvet-softness gives way to the bump of gold beading. She always latches on to good textures.\nAt the front of Appa, Aang sighs and pats Appa\u2019s forehead. \u201cI know, buddy,\u201d Aang says, loud enough for them to hear. \u201cWe\u2019re all neglected up here. No firebender to keep us warm \u2026 No friends to cuddle with \u2026\u201d\n\u201cI thought airbenders could regulate their breathing to keep warm,\u201d Sokka says.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the same,\u201d Aang says.\n\u201cAang,\u201d Zuko says, \u201cyou\u2019re a firebender, too.\u201d\nAang pouts, but lets out a puff of warm air that ruffles his clothes. They all laugh at him. None of them feel bad. Aang will seize any opportunity to get hugs from his friends, and they know by the end of the night, when they make their way to their apartment being aired out in the Upper Ring, Aang will end up underneath a second cuddle pile.\nAs they fly above the city, they wave down at the people below. Half of Zuko\u2019s hair has come loose from his topknot, and the wind pushes at him, scrubs its fingers through his hair. Zuko smiles against the feel of it, his eyes clinking up until the lights of Ba Sing Se blur into an interrupted sea of gold.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTraditionally, princes and princesses know they\u2019re going to inherit the throne decades before it happens. They are born the eldest child of the reigning Fire Lord, and are groomed from birth to lead the country. They know who they are destined to be from infancy.\nZuko spent three years as the Crown Prince before his banishment. After Azulon\u2019s death, lessons ramped up, and Ozai spoke to him with increasing coldness, and Zuko walked through the corridors were tapestries of his ancestors adorned in Fire Lord robes were hung, a knot in his throat. He wanted to be a good leader. He thought that that was what he wanted, more than anything\u2014to make his family proud.\nAnd then he was banished. Zuko spent as many years out at sea as he did in the palace, being trained as the Crown Prince.\nHe\u2019s not as poised as he should be. Sometimes, he trips over tradition, and isn\u2019t entirely sure how certain meetings should be run, and he gets turned around in the palace, like he\u2019s somewhere strange, rather than the place he grew up. He had expected that, coming back.\nWhat Zuko hadn\u2019t expected, however, was the way he feels on the journey to and from Ba Sing Se. The ship is much grander than the small, rusted ship he had commanded during his banishment, and the crew is twice as large and infinitely more polite, but when Zuko stands out on the deck, he feels a little bit like he\u2019s returning home. The noise of the waves, the scent of coal and salt on the wind, the deck rocking beneath his feet, and the scurry of men bustling through the ship\u2014it\u2019s familiar.\nSuddenly living on a ship and visiting foreign ports had been a cultural shock, but it had hurt, returning to the Fire Nation and feeling that same shock. Once-familiar things had soured and turned strange in the years he was gone.\nHe sees the surprise of his crew\u2014a new, temporary crew\u2014when he talks about the ship like he knows it intimately, when he greets them in the halls, when he corrects the Captain about how the wind will affect their trajectory. He does it all with an even temper, too. He knows he came close to mutiny more than once when he was banished. He has so much more power, now; he can\u2019t be that kind of tyrant again.\nThe years he spent in exile trained him how to be Fire Lord, in a way. The experience he gained shaped him into a leader, more than any lessons about etiquette and tradition ever could. Banishing him was the best thing Ozai ever did.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nZuko walks back to his rooms, mind still focused on the reports and colour-coloured maps back in his office. The Fire Nation is stretched over the globe in colonies and camps and war ships, and the responsibility of calling everyone home en-mass falls to Zuko.\nBefore Uncle left for Ba Sing Se, he made Zuko promise to take care of himself. Uncle passed that promise on to Mai, and Mai passed it on to his head of staff, and she passed it on to his personal servants, and now, Zuko gets gentle reminders to eat and sleep and let his mind rest, reminders he can\u2019t ignore because of his weeks-old promise to Uncle, even though he wants nothing more than to turn back around and work out to get thousands of soldiers and civilians back home.\nBut if he had ignored his servants soft-spoken reminders to get some rest, he wouldn\u2019t have seen this. He would have continued working without knowing about the violence that took place under his roof.\nA serving boy, struggling to balance a large dish in his arms, trips on the end of a rug. He doesn\u2019t make a noise when he falls face-first into the marble floors, but Zuko hears the sound of metal plates spinning into a wall. He turns around in time to see a noblewoman strike the serving boy across the face.\nThe boy hits the ground a second time, and then he pushes himself onto his knees and scoops up the honeyed fruit spilt across the floor, eyes downcast, the noblewoman bearing down on him from above. Juice soaks his loose cotton pants. His cheek is red. Zuko can\u2019t tell from this distance whether or not his lip is split.\n\u201cYou clumsy idiot,\u201d says the nobleman through her teeth. The serving boy, barely a teenager, murmurs apologises as he cups dirtied fruit in his hands. The noblewoman continues on as if she can\u2019t hear him: \u201cDo you have any idea how much these robes are worth? Do you think liquids can be washed out of fine silk?\u201d\nThe noblewoman raises her hand again. Zuko catches her wrist in mid-air. Both the noblewoman and serving boy freeze.\nWith his other hand, Zuko flags down a passing servant. \u201cBring something to clean up this spill. Thank you.\u201d\nHe releases the woman\u2019s hand. She cradles it to her chest and drops into a low bow. \u201cMy Lord.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t strike my servants,\u201d Zuko says in a tight voice. \u201cI will not see the people under my care hurt, especially not because of a mistake, and especially not from an educated noble that should know better than to use violence to vent her frustrations.\u201d\nThe woman twists up the hems of her skirt, pulling it up to show off the juice splatters on the pale red fabric. \u201cMy Lord,\u201d she says again. \u201cHis clumsiness\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re all clumsy sometimes. No one should be afraid for their own safety after making a mistake.\u201d\nThe noblewoman is taller and maybe two decades older than him, but he doesn\u2019t know her from his childhood. Maybe that is why his double-meaning passes over her head. Any of the nobles that had seen Zuko, the unlucky, least favoured child, growing up in this palace would know what he meant when he defended a child from being struck by someone older. By someone stronger.\nZuko turns away from the woman. He can\u2019t look at her anymore. He\u2019s too tired and he\u2019s been working too hard on keeping his temper to blow up now.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Zuko asks the serving boy.\nThe boy\u2019s nose almost touches the ground. Zuko has seen dozens, hundreds, of men knelt like this in front of the Fire Lord. Zuko has knelt like this, too.\nThe boy\u2019s eyes are focussed on the hems of Zuko\u2019s robes. His eyes flick up, as though checking that Zuko is talking to him, before settling back on Zuko\u2019s robe. \u201cAko, My Lord.\u201d\n\u201cAko,\u201d Zuko says, \u201care you alright?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, my Lord.\u201d\nZuko extends a hand. Ako wrenches his gaze away from Zuko\u2019s robes and looks up at him, properly looks at him. His yellow eyes are blown wide and one cheek is flushed a splotchy red in what would probably become a nasty bruise. He looks as though he doesn\u2019t know what to do with Zuko\u2019s hand, hovering, palm up, in front of his face, so Zuko bends down and grasps Ako\u2019s wrist and tugs him to his feet.\nAko ducks his head, chin touching his chest, so Zuko can\u2019t see his face. He\u2019s still holding fruit in his fist, and juice leaks out through his fingers from where he is squeezing too hard.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Zuko says in that even tone he used with Aang when he got too shaken up to remember that firebending was more than raw destruction. \u201cYou made a mistake. You\u2019re okay.\u201d\n\u201cYes, My Lord,\u201d Ako says to the floor.\nThe second servant returns with towels and a jug of water to rinse the floor. Ako bends down to help him.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to do that, Ako,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cYou should go wash your face, take the time to calm down.\u201d\nAko opens his mouth, as though to argue, but then snaps it shut quickly. He rises back to his feet, head bowed again.\nTo the noblewoman, Zuko says, \u201cYou can go. Remember what I said. I won\u2019t be as calm if you strike a servant, again.\u201d\nThe woman\u2019s jaw is tight, but she bows, and says dutifully, \u201cYes, My Lord.\u201d\nThen, Zuko turns back to the two servants. \u201cIf anyone hurts you like that, tell me or my head of staff. Tell your coworkers what I have said. I won\u2019t let people be hurt under my care.\u201d\nThey peek up at him as though they don\u2019t know what to make of him. Zuko nods once, overcome with familiar awkwardness now that he has said his piece, before turning on his heel and striding away. All thoughts of reports and maps are gone. He wants, more than anything, to sleep.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nMy dearest nephew,\n\n\nIt\u2019s only been two weeks since you were in Ba Sing Se, and already you\u00a0ask for my advice? If only you had listened to me this keenly when you were younger.\n\n\nIn response to what you mentioned in your letter\u2014remember, the reason we call someone leader is because they decide to go first. The nation looks to you as its example. But people cannot trust if they do not feel safe.\n\n\nIn lighter news, the Jasmine Dragon is hosting an unofficial Pai Sho tournament next Sunday. I have called in extra staff as I will be busy the entire day trying to earn my title as Pai Sho master. It\u2019s times like these I miss you the most. Your customer service skills left something to be desired, but it was so good to have an extra pair of hands around to wait tables. It\u2019s a shame being the Fire Lord is so important, or else I would have thought you were neglecting your uncle\u2019s family business. You made a very good waiter.\n\n\nHave hope, nephew, and remember that kindness will be our guide in this dawning age of peace.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nUncle\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nZuko has begun to remove his ministers and generals from power, but it is a long and exhausting process. He\u2019s going to replace most of them\u2014he knows that, and they know that, he\u2019s sure. They knew from the first time he hobbled into a meeting with a barely-healed lightning wound, a stack of drafts waiting to be legalised under one arm. Katara had come in to drag him back to bed soon after, but she says the way he stood at the head of the table, swaying under his own weight, half-delirious with pain, would have been frightening for anyone that hadn\u2019t seen him covered in bison slobber. Something about the set of his jaw, she said. Something about the way the torches caught his eyes, so they looked like pricks of burning ice, cold enough to burn the room to ash.\nThe idea that he might scare his ministers is surprising, but maybe it shouldn\u2019t be, considering that now he could kill them, could burn their faces and cast them into banishment, if he wanted to. He won\u2019t. He couldn\u2019t. But they don\u2019t know that.\nBut the current government can\u2019t stand. When he took the throne, Zuko gained the ministers who simpered under Ozai\u2019s feet and Generals who brought his plans into being, people who were ready and willing to burn the world. They cannot stay in this time of peace. Zuko has justifiable reason to bring in new ministers and the power to make it happen, but it will take time for him to do it the right way. It will take time for him to find people he can trust to replace them.\nBut it\u2019s okay. Now, Zuko is realising that he has time. Decades of it.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen Zuko takes a break from training and sees a boy peaking at him from behind a pillar, he realises he hasn\u2019t seen children in the palace since he was a child himself. A guard had been trying to coax the boy out, but he remains stubbornly out of reach.\nZuko wipes sweat off his brow with a cloth, and then makes his way over. The guard looks pained when she realises Zuko\u2019s training has been interrupted.\n\u201cWho is this?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cKatsu,\u201d says the boy, stepping around the pillar, still managing to stay out of the guard\u2019s reach.\nEvery time he sees a child, Zuko is surprised at how tiny they are. He remembers the cold shock that washed over him when he pinned Aang\u2019s hands down for the first time, way back at the Southern Water Tribe, and realised how small his wrists were.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a firebender,\u201d Katsu says.\n\u201cI am,\u201d Zuko says.\n\u201cI\u2019m a firebender, too. I want to be able to bend like you one day.\u201d Katsu whirls around in a clumsy stance and thrusts his fist out. A cloud of smoke and sparks jump from his knuckles. Katsu looks disappointed at the lack of real fire. \u201cI\u2019m not very good at the moment, though.\u201d\n\u201cThat was great,\u201d Zuko argues. \u201cYour smoke is dark. My smoke was pale for the first twelve months. How old are you?\u201d\n\u201cFive,\u201d Katsu says.\n\u201cDo you want to know a secret?\u201d Katsu looks excited and nods his head up and down, so Zuko kneels down and whispers, \u201cI couldn\u2019t firebend until I was six.\u201d\nKatsu\u2019s mouth opens. \u201cBut I saw you bending just now\u2014you\u2019re so good. You must be the best firebender in the whole world. You had colours in your fire. No one ever has colours. How did you do it?\u201d\n\u201cI listened to my teachers and practised.\u201d Zuko pauses. He\u2019s barely an adult, but he\u2019s an authority figure. What do authority figures say to kids? \u201cAnd I ate my veggies every night.\u201d\nKatsu pulls a face like he knows, even at five, that Zuko is lying to him. The guard bites at her lip to stop from snickering.\n\u201cNow, Katsu,\u201d Zuko says, \u201cdo you know how you got here? Where are your parents?\u201d\n\u201cI got lost,\u201d Katsu says. \u201cMy Mum is thinking about working here and she brought me along since our neighbour is sick and couldn\u2019t watch me. I went to explore and then I heard firebending \u2026\u201d\n\u201cAnd you wanted to come see,\u201d Zuko finishes. \u201cRight. Well, we should probably go find your Mum.\u201d\n\u201cI can take him, sir,\u201d says the guard.\nKatsu latches onto Zuko\u2019s training pants and eyes the guard like he thinks she might wrench him off Zuko with force.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cI\u2019ll take him.\u201d\nKatsu takes Zuko\u2019s hand before Zuko can offer it, and he stares down at the place where their fingers are tangled together. Such small hands, he thinks. Small, and unblemished, and trusting.\nWith every passing day, he understands his father less and less.\nThey weave through the halls in search of Katsu\u2019s mother. Katsu keeps up a steady babble of chatter as they go.\n\u201cThe Fire Lord has a scar like you do, you know,\u201d Katsu says, and Zuko almost trips over his own feet.\nHe\u2019s in his training clothes. Plain pants and a loose t-shirt. No crown. His hair is pulled back into a ponytail at the nape of his neck. Of course a child wouldn\u2019t recognise a sweaty, dressed down teenager as the Fire Lord.\nZuko keeps his voice even, casual. \u201cOh, really?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, so you shouldn\u2019t be ashamed of your scar. The scar means the Fire Lord is strong and brave. That\u2019s what Mum says.\u201d Katsu leans in, like he\u2019s whispering, even though he\u2019s talking at regular volume. \u201cI asked Mum where he got it, and she said the last Fire Lord gave it to him\u2014the Fire Lord\u2019s dad. Just \u2018cause he said something rude.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d Zuko is proud of how steady his voice comes out, even though he feels torn between laughing and crying.\n\u201cI like the new Fire Lord better, anyway.\u201d If this were a different time, if the nation was run by a Fire Lord like Azula, such a sentence could be borderline treason. It suggests that the other option, not liking the Fire Lord, is a possibility.\n\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s letting my dad and big brother come home. They\u2019ve been fighting in the war for a long time.\u201d Katsu squirms and his hand almost slips out of Zuko\u2019s. \u201cI haven\u2019t met my brother before. He left before I was born. What if he doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m family? What if he doesn\u2019t like me?\u201d\nBefore Katsu was born. Katsu\u2019s brother has been away from home for over five years. Zuko had been forbidden from returning home for over three years, and for a long time, there had been no foreseeable end to his banishment. It had eaten a hole through his stomach. Is that how soldiers across the globe had felt, being kept from their home and their families by the unending war, while knowing that they might die before they make it home? It sounds like torture. Zuko keeps finding new reasons to be grateful that the war is over every day.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll like you,\u201d Zuko says, even though he\u2019s not really qualified to be giving advice to siblings on how to foster a healthy relationship.\n\u201cReally?\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\nThey head away from Zuko\u2019s wing of the palace. Katsu is interested in the gardens, and tapestries, and gilded doorways. By the time they find his mother, she\u2019s worked up, half-jogging through a courtyard as she calls out Katsu\u2019s name.\n\u201cMum!\u201d Katsu waves. His mother looks up, sees her son, sees the man holding onto his hand, and looks like she\u2019s going to pass out.\n\u201cMum,\u201d Katsu says when she scurries over, \u201cI met a firebender! His fire has colours and everything, even though he didn\u2019t start bending until he was six.\u201d Katsu slaps a hand over his mouth. \u201cThat was supposed to be a secret.\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t really a secret,\u201d Zuko says.\nKatsu hadn\u2019t recognised Zuko in his training clothes, but his mother does. She drops into a low bow, her braid dangling over one shoulder and almost touching the floor.\n\u201cMy Lord,\u201d she says, \u201cplease forgive me. I\u2019m sorry for the intrusion.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cKatsu didn\u2019t cause any trouble. He\u2019s a curious kid. Curiosity can be a valuable trait.\u201d\n\u201cMum?\u201d Katsu looks from his mum to Zuko, not understanding what is happening.\n\u201cGo with your mum, now,\u201d Zuko tells him. \u201cDon\u2019t wonder away from her again, okay? I\u2019m sure you scared her when she couldn\u2019t find you. And remember to practise your firebending.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to practise everyday until I\u2019m better than you,\u201d Katsu says, and his mum chokes on her next inhale.\n\u201cI hope so.\u201d To Katsu\u2019s mum, he says, \u201cYou have a good son. I hope your husband and eldest have a safe trip home.\u201d\nShe straightens up, one hand pressed against her sternum, and she looks like she doesn\u2019t know what to do with Zuko\u2019s kindness. If he had yelled her, she could have understood. But his gentle smile, his easy words\u2014it rattles her.\n\u201cThank you, My Lord,\u201d is all she manages.\nKatsu\u2019s hand drops out of his. He stares up at Zuko with big eyes. \u201cShould I bow?\u201d he asks.\nZuko can\u2019t stop the laugh that bubbles up his throat. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t need to bow.\u201d\nZuko bids them goodbye. As he leaves, he hears Katsu say, \u201cMum, I was right. The new Fire Lord is the best one yet.\u201d He stops, and then adds, with some disgust, \u201cHe told me to eat my veggies, though.\u201d\nZuko manages to wait until he\u2019s in an empty corridor before he bursts out laughing.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nZuko wants to argue against this. It feels wrong to allow a tapestry of his image to be woven with fine silk and gold threads while knowing that the outer reaches of his nation are struggling. But his advisors are right\u2014there have been enough whispers about the way Zuko had risen from exiled prince to traitor to Fire Lord. By hanging his image beside his ancestors, he would be securing his place as the blood-right heir.\nZuko had been raised in the palace. He had thought that coming back to a life of luxury would be easy, but the gross displays of wealth and power are hard to stomach after everything he\u2019s been through. He floated for weeks on driftwood in arctic waters. He almost starved on the dusty Earth Kingdom plains. You don\u2019t forget that.\nBut he makes himself sit for the head weaver at least an hour a day. He usually spends these hours filling out paperwork and drafting bills or letters to his friends or foreign dignitaries, but today, Zuko can\u2019t pull his eyes away from the weaver\u2019s fine hands. Charcoal and ink sketches are stacked in her lap.\nIf the final battle had ended differently, this woman would be capturing Azula\u2019s likeness, not Zuko\u2019s. Perhaps his father would have demanded more tapestries of himself, too, to commemorate his promotion from Fire Lord to Phoenix King.\nAnd Zuko\u2019s image would have been lost forever. History would have remembered him as the traitorous son of the great Phoenix King Ozai, a son who knew nothing of loyalty or respect, who wrongly sided with the foolish Avatar in a bid for power\u2014\nAfter his victory, though, history will remember him as a different man.\nThe weaver lowers her sketches. \u201cMy Lord \u2026\u201d\nZuko wrenches his gaze away from the beginnings of the tapestry, set delicately on the side table. \u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cI was wondering, My Lord, what it is you \u2026 That is \u2026\u201d She wets her lips and looks anywhere but at his face.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be nervous,\u201d he says, though his tone doesn\u2019t have half the patience and mercy she deserves. He\u2019s been working on becoming a better person, a better leader, for a long time, well before he was properly crowned, but he finds it hard to wrestle his temper down, sometimes.\n\u201cYour scar,\u201d she says.\n\u201cAh,\u201d Zuko says, and tries to ignore the way she ducks her head at his tone, her greying fringe falling into her eyes\u2014more a flinch than a bow. \u201cInclude it. Don\u2019t try and hide it or distract from it. It\u2019s a part of me and my story, even if it might not make for an attractive tapestry.\u201d\nShe peaks at him from beneath her hair. She\u2019s gained some of her strength back. That\u2019s good. His people have never been the type to cower, even if a century of violence was left wounds on them all.\n\u201cMy Lord, you underestimate my skill. Every part of this tapestry will be beautiful.\u201d\nHe can\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to insult a master of her craft. Continue, please.\u201d\nShe makes a mark on the parchment and then bends down and picks up the tapestry, inspecting the work that has already been done. The final product will take up the better part of a wall. What she holds in her hands looks smaller than a throw cushion.\nShe has a small fleet of apprentices working for her, he knows. How many people will see it when it\u2019s complete? The tapestry of the young, scarred Fire Lord will hang in these halls for centuries.\nZuko stopped feeling ashamed of the scar a long time ago. It would be an insult to his people if he was still embarrassed about it; he has already heard about Fire Nations civilians with disfiguring burns that have begun to take pride in the scars they were once ashamed of. People are reclaiming their marks because their young Fire Lord bears the same scars, and it is not a sign of his defeat. It is a reminder of his bravery. It is a testament to his strength that he could overcome a man as merciless as Ozai.\nZuko had heard his story circulating through ports and naval bases when he was chasing the Avatar, even if Uncle attempted to shield him from the worst of it. The way the Fire Nation officials had spoken of his Agni Kai had reinforced all of Zuko\u2019s ugly, self-blaming thoughts and drowned out the words of passing Earth Kingdom people, who reviled any man who would hold a flame to his child\u2019s face.\nNow, though, the Fire Nation tells a different story. There are still those that see his scar as further proof that he is unfit to rule, but there would always be people who despise him and everything he stands for. A larger part of the nation sees his scar as something else. A reminder of what kind of beast the last Fire Lord was. A mark of Zuko\u2019s strength that he could overcome him. A sign of Zuko\u2019s honour\nThe scar made him strong and brave, Katsu had said. Zuko keeps the words, the memory of his face shining up at Zuko with certainty as he spoke of the new Fire Lord, tucked close to his chest. From the mouth of babes, Uncle would say.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSoldiers pour from the port like ants. They cannot see him from his place on the balcony of the Mayor\u2019s office. His eternally present guards hover behind him, and Zuko wonders if they want to step forward and take a closer look at the sight unravelling beneath them.\nMany of the old ministers Zuko is working to replace see soldiers coming home in droves as a defeat. Zuko doesn\u2019t understand it. If they were here, breathing in the salt air beside him, they would change their mind. How can anyone see a soldier jogging down the jetty and falling to his knees to embrace his crying children, planting frantic kisses into their hair, reaching out with one hand to grasp for the hand of his waiting wife, and see defeat?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen Zuko was a child, the official age for military enlistment was 16. In the last years of the war, after Zuko\u2019s banishment, Ozai pushed the age down to 14. Zuko didn\u2019t hear the announcement in person. He heard it the way he heard everything, those days\u2014through rumours circulating around inter-nation ports.\nOzai said that the Fire Nation was making its final push towards glory. He said young men and women would have the chance to bring honour to their families by helping to spread their superior culture to the world. He said the youngest soldiers would be contained mostly to the mainlands and colonies to fill desk jobs and keep Fire Nation-owned bases running so experienced soldiers could be out fighting on the front lines.\nZuko heard what soldiers and foreign countrymen thought of this law, too. He learnt a lot about what people thought about Ozai in those days. Traitors, he had called them. Cowards without honour. Dirt eaters. He called some of them these insults to their face before Uncle had jumped in and dragged him away, even if something he refused to name took root in Zuko\u2019s chest. His father was the Fire Lord; he knew what was best for the country. Zuko was a loyal son and didn\u2019t know how to run a nation, let alone how to win a war, and even if the thought of boys and girls who were his age\u2014who were Azula\u2019s age\u2014being recruited to the army made him want to throw up\u2014well, Zuko had been stripped of his honour. What did he know?\nTwo years have passed since Ozai first changed the enlistment age, and the horror is still there in Zuko\u2019s chest, amplified twofold by the reports that are piling in.\nA ship carrying several divisions of soldiers\u2014many of them injured, and most of them underage\u2014was due to land in a few days. Zuko sails out to meet them with as many healers as he can carry.\nThe 107th regiment is the youngest in the army. They were officially assigned to man the Fire Nation bases inside Earth Kingdom territory, but when the Earth Kingdom retaliated and more soldiers were needed and no general sent back-up, they were sent in to fight.\nThe division\u2019s Captain is Uncle\u2019s age. His grey sideburns are uneven. He bows to Zuko when he boards.\n\u201cMy Lord,\u201d he says. He stands with perfect, straight-backed posture, even if he looks like he might fall over with exhaustion. He bares the attention of his Fire Lord with a serious expression. Haunted, Zuko corrects. Not serious. His eyes seem almost vacant.\n\u201cI\u2019ve brought healers,\u201d Zuko says, \u201cas many available as I could find.\u201d\nHe steps aside so the healers may board. A girl, maybe a few younger than Zuko, steps forward to lead them down to the lower decks.\n\u201cThank you, My Lord,\u201d says the Captain.\nZuko opens his mouth. Hesitates. \u201cI heard that children weren\u2019t supposed to see active combat.\u201d\n\u201cThat was what we were told at first, My Lord,\u201d says the Captain. \u201cBut then \u2026\u201d\n\u201cBut then,\u201d Zuko agrees. But then platoons of soldiers were lost and needed replacing. But then the Fire Nation wrestled more land from the Earth Kingdom and more soldiers were needed to guard it. But then the Fire Nation\u2019s attacks got bigger and more ambitious, and required more warm bodies to push their territory forward.\nZuko takes a steading breath. On his exhale, steam comes out of his nose. The Captain takes a step back.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Zuko says, and ignores the wide-eyed look the Captain shoots him. A Fire Lord should not apologise. That is what he has been taught from infancy. \u201cI knew it was bad, but hearing this is still \u2026\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re children,\u201d says the Captain.\n\u201cYes,\u201d says Zuko. \u201cThis shouldn\u2019t have happened to them.\u201d\nSome of the tightness relaxes around the Captain\u2019s eyes, and Zuko thinks, How many higher-ups has this man talked to? How many people looked this man in the eye and told him that they didn\u2019t care how old the children under his care were, they were expected to fight and potentially die for their country? Did he expect Zuko to do the same?\nThat nauseous feeling is back. Zuko swallows and exhales steam again, and focuses on not vomiting all over his Captain\u2019s shoes. His ministers haven\u2019t instructed him on where a Fire Lord should or should not throw up, but he\u2019s sure on his traumatised officers isn\u2019t the right answer.\n\u201cSend them home,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cIf they\u2019re still injured and their families can\u2019t afford for them to continue seeing a healer, the government will compensate them. There are shelters and foster families for those that don\u2019t have places to go.\u201d\n\u201cFoster families?\u201d The Captain says the word slowly, like he\u2019s testing how it feels in his mouth.\nZuko explains the new foster family programs, and some of the blankness leaves the Captain\u2019s eyes. He has a good track record. Zuko has read his files, he knows that he was almost discharged for arguing, again and again, with the orders to send teenagers into the battlefield. Most of the combat that they saw was the unavoidable kind, because they were ambushed or because the Captain had been told they were send them somewhere worse if he continued refusing. If he wants to redeem himself by finally providing a safe place for kids, after a year of being unable to do so, then Zuko won\u2019t stop him.\nZuko talks to some of the soldiers, the ones not too feverish to know what is going on around them. Many of them were fourteen when they were recruited. Now, they\u2019re around his age.\nZuko leaves most of the healers onboard. Before he steps onto the gangplank, the Captain stops him.\n\u201cMy Lord,\u201d he says, \u201cmay I ask\u2014how old is the Avatar?\u201d\nIf this was a different officer, Zuko would hesitate longer before answering. \u201cHe\u2019s thirteen.\u201d\n\u201cAnd \u2026\u201d The Captain stops like he\u2019s choked on his own tongue.\n\u201cYes?\u201d Zuko prompts.\n\u201cMy Lord,\u201d says the Captain, \u201chow old are you?\u201d\n\u201cOld enough,\u201d Zuko says, and heads back onto his own ship before the Captain can ask anymore questions that Zuko doesn\u2019t know how to answer.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nThe Fire Nation is broke.\nSozin militarised the country, and Azulon and Ozai continued their armament. Families had spent generations making a living from the war. Factories had churned out weapons and armour for a century. Sons of sons of sons held careers in the army. Coastal villages had forgotten a time when they were anything more than a poverty-stricken extension of naval bases.\nThe war ended lives and pulled funds away from vital areas, like culture and education, but no one could deny that it made money. It created jobs.\nAnd Zuko had shut down that century-old moneymaking system in one brutal swoop.\nThe mass exodus of Fire Nation citizens from Earth Kingdom colonies and soldiers marching home from years abroad means there is an influx of displaced people,\u00a0too.\nCountries financially and physically gutted by the Fire Nation had been considering war reparations. Thankfully, Zuko has the Avatar in his corner. Aang has been speaking to foreign leaders on his behalf and convincing them to focus on peace and rebuilding rather than ruining the Fire Nation\u2019s economy. It also helps that Zuko is personally acquainted with people like Chief Hakoda of the Southern Water Tribe.\nZuko still sends foreign aid, even if his friends had helped quieten the demand for reparations. He has been fighting the older ministers that remain to create a skeleton welfare system to assist disabled ex-soldiers, widowers, and newly unemployed peoples who would\u2019ve ended up on the streets without his help. He has been overseeing the construction of orphanages throughout the nation.\nZuko is busier than he\u2019s ever been, and it\u2019s hard work, frustrating work, but he finally feels as though he\u2019s making progress. Zuko knows how to work for what he has, how to struggle; sometimes, it feels like it\u2019s all he knows how to do. This is a different kind of battle than Zuko is used to facing, a battle of politics and tradition and trade, but Zuko is learning. He\u2019s improving.\nFor the first time since Uncle said that Zuko should be crowned the next Fire Lord, Zuko feels as though he can do this.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nZuko had been looking forward to having his friends in the palace again. They bring excitement wherever they go; however, there\u2019s only so much excitement the Fire Nation, a proud and serious country, can handle.\n\u201cA dance?\u201d Zuko says flatly.\nAang bounces on his toes. From his place behind his desk, Zuko can\u2019t see if Aang\u2019s feet are on the ground, or if he\u2019s risen a few inches off the office floor. His weightlessness stopped being strange to Zuko months ago. Sometimes, though, he sees the palace staff\u2019s bewildered faces as they watch Aang flit about the high-ceilinged palace as though unaffected by gravity.\n\u201cIt was one of my favourite things about the Fire Nation. There would be grand festivals every year.\u201d Aang pivots on his heel and falls into a loosely structured dance, hands swaying in the air. \u201cThere were dozens of dances. Everyone would come together to celebrate and dance, and there would be brilliant lanterns strung up everywhere, and so much food, and\u2014and now, people in the Fire Nation don\u2019t even know how to dance.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know these dances, either,\u201d Zuko says, and only just stops himself tacking on, And I have no desire to learn.\n\u201cI know them, though,\u201d Aang says, \u201cand other people have to know them, too. It can\u2019t have been completely forgotten.\u201d\nAang is still twirling around his spacious office like a cherry blossom petal caught in the wind. Aang always bounces from place to place effortlessly, appreciating cultures and making friends everywhere he goes. He\u2019s a likeable kid. He belongs everywhere. It\u2019s easy to forget that he\u2019s the last of his people, the only person left who remembers his culture and customs. Some knowledge remains in the Air Nomad scrolls and artefacts that survived the attack and centuries of pillagers, but there are large chunks of Air Nomad culture that will never be recovered.\nZuko\u2019s culture had been\u2014stifled, he supposes is the right term. The war had eaten away at all of the nations. He still remembers the Southern Water Tribe, a shrunken village made up of women, children, and the elderly, tiny compared to the mighty force of the Northern Water Tribe. Across the globe, blood has been spilt and families decimated; in comparison, the Fire Nation losing traditional dances and festivals feels small, incomparable, but it still niggles away at Zuko.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Zuko begins, \u201cno one has much money at the moment, especially the national treasury.\u201d\n\u201cIt won\u2019t cost much,\u201d Aang says. \u201cFood vendors would jump at the opportunity to set up stalls during a festival.\u201d\nZuko considers this. \u201cHm. It may encourage spending.\u201d\n\u201cYou might need some lanterns for decorations, but you\u2019re all firebenders, it won\u2019t take much to keep them lit. It\u2019s making sure everyone knows the dances\u2014that\u2019s the main issue.\u201d\n\u201cI have the contacts of a few cultural experts. I assumed most of them would be concerned with maintaining traditions like my coronation ceremony, but if we\u2019re reviving old dances, then maybe I could talk with them \u2026\u201d\nAang watches him rifle through his scrolls and mutter under his breath about planning and approval and city plans. A smile blooms over his face. He jumps so high his fingers brushed the ceiling.\n\u201cWe\u2019re having a party!\u201d\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Zuko corrects.\nBut nothing can put a damper on Aang\u2019s excitement. He dances around the office, commanding the wind with every artistic placement of his feet. \u201cWe\u2019re maybe having a party!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe festival begins in the late evening. Vendors have set up their stalls, musicians are strategically posted throughout the city, so music can be heard wherever you go, and lanterns hang in ropes, bathing the streets in soft candlelight. There will be dancers, later. Masters of the long-forgotten craft will coax people into an easy rhythm after the first dance of the evening has finished.\nUncle has returned to the Fire Nation for the festival. He sets up a stall a few minutes from the city centre. It\u2019s large and comfortable, with canopied ceilings, and low tables and lounges for customers to sit on.\nTiny lights float through the air like fireflies, low enough to avoid the flammable gossamer draped along the top of the stall, but high enough to avoid the heads of passing customers. Precise firebending like this takes years to master, but Uncle manages it without even sweating.\nUncle has pinched his favourite servers from the palace kitchens without telling Zuko. They all look happy to work for Uncle, serving tea and talking to customers, so Zuko doesn\u2019t nag Uncle about protocol.\nUncle moves between tables to check on his customers. Everyone is flushed with warmth from the tea, from the floating lights, from the contagious energy of the festival, and they open up under Uncle\u2019s friendly attention. Uncle is in his element here. It settles something in Zuko\u2019s chest to see Uncle so at peace.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nZuko meets his friends in Uncle\u2019s stall an hour after the festival begins. He has reserved a table at the back for them. Gossamer is draped over the table like a curtain, separating them from the throng of customers.\nAang tells him about his Fire Nation friends that he invited to the festival. He says they will arrive soon. Zuko isn\u2019t sure how Aang managed to make friends while hiding in enemy territory, and when Katara and Sokka pitch in to help tell the story, he\u2019s still not sure he understands.\nZuko squints at the pale green tea cupped between his hands. \u201cWhat did Uncle put in this? It can\u2019t be just tea, because I could have sworn you said\u2014\u201d\nKatara cocks her head to the side like she thinks Zuko is especially slow. \u201cSapphire Fire, yes.\u201d\n\u201cSapphire Fire,\u201d Zuko repeats.\nSokka rubs at his bare upper lip like he\u2019s twirling an invisible moustache. \u201cAnd I\u2019m Wang Fire, her curmudgeonly husband. We\u2019re from the colonies.\u201d\n\u201cWang,\u201d Zuko says in a strangled voice. Beside him, Toph cackles and thumps at the table with her fist.\n\u201cRealistic Fire Nation names, right, Zuko?\u201d Katara\u2019s head is still cocked. Her expression is innocent. Zuko knows when he\u2019s being mocked.\n\u201cHow did you all avoid being caught?\u201d\n\u201cHey, our disguises were great,\u201d Sokka says. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been good at hiding in plain sight.\u201d\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Zuko says, \u201cI regret my actions in Ba Sing Se, but I\u2019m kind of relieved that I didn\u2019t have to watch you four pretend to be Fire Nation citizens. It would\u2019ve given me a stomach ulcer.\u201d\n\u201cI thought we did pretty well,\u201d Aang says.\n\u201cSapphire Fire,\u201d Zuko repeats again.\n\u201cThe names were Sokka\u2019s idea,\u201d Katara says, \u201cbut in this family we stick with each other\u2019s false identities, no matter how ridiculous.\u201d\nAang snicks and elbows Katara, so Zuko assumes he missed out on months worth of outrageous aliases while he was chasing them around the globe.\nBut, really. Sapphire Fire. Was this the kind of stealth techniques that alluded him for so long?\n\u201cI wish Zuko could\u2019ve been there,\u201d Toph says. \u201cI wanted to hear his dumb voice when he had to dress up and use whatever crazy name Sokka gave him. Hearing the Fire Nation prince address himself as \u2018Mr. Fire\u2019? Priceless.\u201d\nSokka continues stroking his invisible moustache, before snapping his fingers and pointing at Zuko. \u201cI got it\u2014Phoenix Fire. Kuzon\u2019s older brother. My eldest son.\u201d\n\u201cBadass,\u201d Toph says.\n\u201cSon?\u201d Zuko says. \u201cI\u2019m older than you.\u201d\n\u201cHey, watch your tone, young man. I will take you over my knee if I have to.\u201d\nKatara places a hand on Sokka\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWang, be patient with the boy. You know he\u2019s sensitive.\u201d\nToph chokes on her laughter, bent almost in double. Aang\u2019s lips are pressed together, trying to stop himself from laughing in Zuko\u2019s face, since he is, apparently, the only decent friend at the table. He\u2019s turning faintly blue from lack of air.\nZuko is glad they\u2019re not out in the open, so his people don\u2019t have to watch their Fire Lord being laughed at.\n\u201cPlease stop pretending to be my parents,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cIt\u2019s so wrong.\u201d\nSokka turns to Katara and shakes his head. \u201cOur boy is so disrespectful. We should have drowned him in the well when we had the chance.\u201d\n\u201cI take it back. You sound just like my dad.\u201d Zuko runs a hand through his hair and laughs. \u201cAlthough, he\u2019d probably then say something about giving the drowning thing another shot if I didn\u2019t improve. I mean, Azula actually did try a few times, and Ozai liked to watch and give her pointers on how to hold me down, so props for accuracy.\u201d\nHe laughs, but then breaks off awkwardly when he realises none of the others are laughing with him.\n\u201cLet\u2019s move on from that before I start crying\u2014\u201d Sokka says loudly, and from the tight set to his jaw, Zuko thinks he might actually start crying if he thinks too hard about what Zuko just said.\n\u201cDid Azula actually try and\u2014?\u201d Aang says, like the idea is so incomprehensible he can barely put it into words.\nZuko fiddles with his cup. \u201cWe had a lot of ponds and fountains around the palace. Azula got bored easily.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Ozai stood there and encouraged\u2014\u201d Katara cuts herself off.\nZuko clears his throat. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have brought it up. Sorry if I made you guys uncomfortable.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d Aang says. A stifling silence hangs over them.\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Katara says abruptly, \u201cSokka actually glued the moustache and beard to his face for the disguise.\u201d\nThe subject change is unsubtle, but Zuko appreciates it nonetheless. \u201cOh?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, it was stuck to him for three days.\u201d\n\u201cKatara!\u201d Sokka squawks.\nThe image of Sokka going about his day with a fake beard glued to his face pops into Zuko\u2019s head, and he laughs so suddenly that tea gets sucked into his lungs. The tense atmosphere fizzles away.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey spilt up, after that. Zuko goes through the festival greeting and thanking all the important people: store-owners, event planners, dancers, the handful of historians and cultural experts who advised him on how to make today as accurate as possible. He knew he would have his work cut out for him trying to keep an entire country happy, but he hadn\u2019t realised he also had to keep so many individuals happy, too. It helps that Zuko is genuinely thankful for their effort. From the way the people light up under his praise, appearing so happy beneath soft lantern light, Zuko assumes he\u2019s able to properly communicate his gratitude.\nThe next time Zuko sees Aang, he\u2019s surrounded by a huddle of schoolchildren. He seems at ease with kids his age.\n\u201cAang,\u201d Zuko says, cutting through the enthusiastic chatter, \u201cthe harmony dance will begin soon.\u201d\n\u201cZuko, hey! Has it really gotten that late?\u201d\n\u201cWe still have another twenty minutes or so. Just don\u2019t forget.\u201d\n\u201cRight, I won\u2019t. Promise.\u201d Aang turns back to the kids with a wide smile, oblivious to the way they\u2019ve gone still, like prey freezing in front of a much bigger predator. Their eyes are fixed on Zuko. On his scar. On the Fire Lord crown that glints under lantern light. \u201cGuys, this is my friend, Zuko. He taught me firebending. Zuko, these are some of my friends from school.\u201d\nZuko shakes his head. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe you went to school in the Fire Nation when you were an enemy of state\u2014a presumed dead enemy of state\u2014and threw a \u2026 dance party, was it?\u201d\nSokka melts out of the crowd with a drumstick the size of his head, lathered in honey sauce. He thumps Zuko on the back. \u201cHey, if you think your head hurts, imagine how I felt when he first tried to run the plan by me.\u201d\n\u201cA dance party,\u201d Zuko says again. It\u2019s been almost an hour since he heard the story and he still struggles to believe it.\n\u201cIn a cave,\u201d Sokka says.\nThe girl with a severe fringe and a ponytail\u2014On Ji, Aang had said\u2014delicately clears her throat. \u201cMy Lord, I\u2019m sorry, but aren\u2019t you throwing a dance party for the entire Fire Nation?\u201d\nSokka splutters out a laugh and Aang turns to his friend with a proud smile. The rest of the kids look amused for half a beat, before their eyes flick to Zuko and they freeze\u2014with horror, this time, rather than shock.\n\u201cForgive me, My Lord,\u201d On Ji says quickly, dropping into a low bow. The other kids follow suit. Aang frowns like he can\u2019t work out why Fire Nation schoolchildren from a small coastal village would scrape and bow in front of Zuko. Sokka keeps munching at his drumstick.\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d Zuko says, spreading his hands out and pulling out the especially kind smile he wears around jumpy servants and young children. \u201cYou\u2019re not wrong. This is a dance party, but I can\u2019t take all the credit; Aang was the one that suggested it.\u201d\nShoji laughs behind his hand. It\u2019s a nervous little sound, but it\u2019s progress. \u201cTwo Fire Nation parties within six months?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not enough!\u201d Aang says, and they all laugh. Some of the tension melts out of the air. Aang is good at this\u2014bringing clashing groups of people together. It\u2019s one of the many reasons why he is so effective as the Avatar and why Zuko trusts him so much.\n\u201cHey, aren\u2019t you going to introduce me?\u201d Sokka says. He waves his drumstick in the air, and Zuko grabs his arm and wrenches his wrist away before he splatters honey sauce all over the gold and crimson embroidery on his outer robes.\nAang rubs sheepishly at the back of his head. \u201cEveryone, this is Sokka, my friend from the Southern Water Tribe. He\u2019s Katara\u2019s brother. You met Katara earlier. Sokka, these are my friends.\u201d\nAang cycles through their names again, and the kids bow in greeting. Sokka waves at them. Zuko doubts Sokka was this calm or welcoming months ago in that cave, when they were one wardrobe malfunction away from being exposed as Fire Nation fugitives. Sokka also didn\u2019t know many firebenders back then. He certainly wasn\u2019t close friends with the Fire Lord.\nSokka throws an arm around Zuko\u2019s shoulders and squeezes. \u201cDon\u2019t let this guy scare you. He\u2019s friendly, I promise. Any friend of Aang\u2019s is a friend of ours, right, Zuko?\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d Zuko says.\nThe kids don\u2019t look like they believe him. They\u2019re smiling, but it looks pained. The kind of smile you would aim at a hungry tigerdillo to try and dissuade it from eating you.\n\u201cWell, it was nice meeting you,\u201d Zuko says, and even this small politeness makes the kids look faint again. People never reacted like this to meeting him when he was the Crown Prince, but then again, Zuko is the Fire Lord now. He doesn\u2019t remember the previous two Fire Lords being polite towards him, let alone kind, and Zuko had been their immediate family. \u201cI have to leave to prepare for the harmony dance. I hope you all enjoy the festival and get involved. Perhaps seeing younger people dancing will encourage the older people to join in as well.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019d be honoured, My Lord,\u201d says On Ji, bowing again. The others bow stiffly behind her.\nZuko turns to go, but then stops. \u201cOh, and may I seek you out later? We\u2019ve been considering changes to the education system, and I\u2019d like to talk to students before that happens. You know better than anyone what schools are like now.\u201d\n\u201cYes, My Lord,\u201d On Ji says.\nSokka bids the group a more casual goodbye, and follows Zuko through the crowd. They\u2019re not quite out of hearing range when they hear the kids exhale as one, like drowning men breaching the ocean\u2019s surface, and start babbling to one another.\n\"My life just flashed before my eyes.\u201d\n\u201cDid that just happen? Shoji, hold me. My knees are giving out.\u201d\n\u201cOn Ji, I can\u2019t believe you just said that\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI thought it was crazy that Kuzon turned out to be the Avatar, but no one said anything about meeting the Fire Lord. Aang, you never said we\u2019d meet him!\u201d\nThe crowds turn and flinch when they see Zuko\u2019s shimmering crown. They drop into quick bows as they sweep past. This is more routine. The sound of the schoolchildren yelling at one another over the sound of Aang\u2019s laughter, however \u2026\n\u201cWas that too much?\u201d Zuko asks. \u201cWas I too much?\u201d\n\"Are you kidding me? That was the funniest thing I\u2019ve seen all week.\u201d Sokka sucks up the last of the meat and snickers against the yellowed bone. \u201cMan, I thought they were going to cry. At you. You.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m very scary,\u201d Zuko informs him, and that only makes Sokka laugh harder.\n\"Oh, yeah,\u201d Sokka says. \u201cVery intimidating. Very manly. Off to go do a fancy synchronised dance with two girls and Aang.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t let Katara and Toph hear you say that. I wouldn\u2019t save you from their wrath.\u201d\nSokka wisely shuts his mouth.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe harmony dance takes place an hour after dusk. A large space has been cleared in the city centre. Guards usher the crowds back a safe distance.\nAang, Katara, Toph, and Zuko space themselves out in a circle. They\u2019ve changed into formal clothes from each of their cultures, though Toph\u2019s shoes are missing, and Katara has forgone wolf furs so she doesn\u2019t overheat in the Fire Nation summer.\nZuko has shed his heavy outer robes. His clothes are hemmed in gold, but they\u2019re lightweight and without armour. They remind him in part of the clothes he wore when he fought Azula, and in part of the Sun Warriors\u2019 attire. His crown is the only thing that marks him as royal.\nThe band, on a tall platform off to one side, start up a slow and steady drum beat. The four of them take up a starting pose.\nThe harmony dance, known more commonly as the Avatar\u2019s journey, is a traditional dance with a long history. It hasn\u2019t been performed in over a century. Normally, the dance has five participants\u2014the Avatar and their four bending teachers. The masters bend and dance in synchronised harmony with the Avatar shifting and moving between them, the bridge between the four elements.\nToday, though, there are four of them. Aang is only representing air. He didn\u2019t want the dance to draw attention to his role as the Avatar, the way the dance is designed to\u2014he wants the dance to celebrate the combined harmony of the four elements, working together as nature intended.\nThe music picks up and they move into the next bending position, and then the next, and the next. They move around the circle in tandem. They step and spin and move together, even as their styles remain unique. Toph is hard and unmoving where Aang is weightless; Zuko is fierce where Katara is fluid.\nAs they move faster and faster, they begin to bend. Air swirls through Aang\u2019s robes. Water follows the arch of Katara\u2019s arms. Chunks of the earth pull away from the ground and chase after Toph. Ribbons of fire twist around Zuko.\nThe beat of the song changes and so, too, does their bending. This is a new aspect of the dance; once, the change in rhythm guided the Avatar as they switched between each element, but now, they switch bending styles.\nThey move away from their proper bending forms and begin to dance like the person to their left. Zuko feet come down in a stomp like an earthbender, and Toph softs her spins so each movement seems less jerky, more fluid, like a waterbender, and Aang drops into an aggressive lunge, flames bursting in his air currents, dancing like a firebender, and Katara is lightweight as she twirls like an airbender.\nTheir form isn\u2019t proper, but their bending doesn\u2019t stop. Zuko still bends fire even as he moves like an earthbender.\nThe song shifts again, and their bending falters even more as they move into the style of their opposite element. Zuko mimics Katara\u2019s grace. Katara is naturally fierce and takes to the forwardness of firebending with ease. Aang moves into the solidness of earthbending and dirt granules whirl through his air currents. Zuko is concentrating on maintaining his crackling strips of fire as he moves like a waterbender, but out of the corner of his eye, he sees Toph wobbling as she tries to spin like an airbender.\nThe beat changes. They switch styles again. Zuko flows up onto his toes and whirls around like an airbender. Their bending has picked back up, now that they\u2019re in a style more resembling their own. His fire thickens and grows hotter in the air.\nThey\u2019re almost done.\nThe song shifts for the last time, and they\u2019re back into their individual styles. Zuko thrusts into a low lunge and his fire is propelled forward. Colours emerge through the flames. Greens and pinks. Colours that have been lost to firebenders for an age.\nAang moves like a hurricane, and Katara commands a tall wave. Toph strips the square of its earth. There is metal there, too. If any of them were to lose control, their elements would be flung out and maim the crowds around them.\nThe song begins to peter out. Traditionally, this is where the masters would move away and the Avatar would begin to dance on their own, commanding all four elements, but Aang twirls, throws a gust of wind into the sky, and folds himself into an end pose, going still like a performer frozen when the curtains close.\nThe three of them continue on a few more steps, and then Katara throws her water into the air. It fizzles out and falls over the crowd in harmless raindrops. She curls her arms over her neck like a sleeping swan and goes still.\nToph and Zuko surge onward, until Toph shoves her hands down and the earth reforms with the ground, and she, too, stops moving. Now, it\u2019s just Zuko dancing in front of his assembled people. The song begins to wind down and Zuko breathes in and in and in, and then steps sharply on his heel and releases. A funnel of rainbow fire flows above the capitol. He strikes an end pose. The music stops.\nSilence rings out over the capitol, long enough for Zuko to begin to regret the entire festival. He can hear his friends breathing heavily around the circle, still frozen in their own end poses.\nAnd then, at once, the crowd starts applauding. They melt out of their end poses and line up and bow. The cheering continues. It echoes up the side\u00a0of the volcano.\nZuko can see Aang\u2019s friends in the crowd, jumping in place and applauding. Sokka is a burst of blue off to the left. He\u2019s shouting something that Zuko can\u2019t hear over the crowd, wearing a smile that\u2019s too big for his face.\nZuko spots Uncle off to the left, flanked by guards. He\u2019s crying. One of the guards is flapping his hands like a possum chicken and trying to offer Uncle a handkerchief, but Uncle only has eyes for Zuko.\nZuko lets himself be swept away by his guards to change back into his robes. Toph wanders off to find Sokka and make him escort her to the meat stalls, and Aang and Katara stay in the centre circle to help the master dancers lead the shy crowds into some beginner-level dances.\nAn office has been opened for the Fire Lord\u2019s use this evening. The guards flank the door. Zuko doesn\u2019t even have time to wash the sweat off his face before Uncle bursts in, crosses the floor, and drags Zuko into a hug.\n\u201cIt was one dance,\u201d Zuko says. His hands rest on Uncle\u2019s shoulder blades\u2014not returning the hug with as much fever as Uncle, but relaxing bonelessly into the hold. \u201cI wasn't even that good.\u201d\n\u201cIt was more than a dance,\u201d Uncle says. \u201cIt was a sign of the peace and strength and grace you will bring to our nation.\u201d\n\u201cUncle,\u201d Zuko says.\n\u201cI\u2019m so proud of you, my nephew.\u201d Uncle cups Zuko\u2019s face in his lined hand. The gesture is so tender, his palm so warm, that Zuko has to take a fortifying breath against the sudden swell of emotion in his chest.\n\u201cI hope they understand what it means,\u201d Zuko mumbles into Uncle\u2019s fingers.\n\u201cThey will,\u201d Uncle says, smiling, and his eyes are still wet. Back on the day of Sozin\u2019s comet, when he had reunited with Uncle and poured out his heart in apology, he had told himself he would never make Uncle cry again. Zuko breaks that promise every time they meet.\n\u201cOr they\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d Uncle continues. \u201cAfter all, they have you to teach them.\u201d\nThrough the office\u2019s gauzy curtains, Zuko can see Aang and Katara spinning around with ease. Aang\u2019s friends have lost their stiffness and have pushed away from the crowds, pumping their legs and arms into the air wildly. Already, the streets are filling with people running out to join the dance; people bobbing their heads in place; people tentatively falling into a loosely structured dance, like a toddler taking its first steps. People who are following their Fire Lord\u2019s lead.\n\u201cI want to be a good leader, Uncle,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cI want to look after my people.\u201d\n\u201cYou will,\u201d Uncle says. \u201cYou are, my nephew.\u201d\nUncle pulls him into another hug, and Zuko closes his eyes against the familiar smell of brewed tea and smoke, and the sound of music and laughter and stomping feet. The sound of people learning how to dance again.\n\u00a0"
