    "text": "Iwaizumi never called first.\nOikawa could hardly get the grumpy vice captain to text back, let alone call him. Getting a call from Iwaizumi Hajime was an extremely unlikely, essentially unthinkable event that rivaled Oikawa\u2019s chances of seeing a UFO (which Oikawa still secretly hopes will happen one day). It was something that Oikawa could only dream about and, even then, the Iwaizumi in his dream would have probably dialed the wrong number anyway. Basically, it was near impossible\u2014fantastical even.\nSo when Oikawa was awoken by the sound of the annoying ringtone (that he had specifically picked out because Iwaizumi hated it) at 2AM to see his best friend\u2019s name flashing on his phone screen, Oikawa couldn\u2019t help but wonder if he was hallucinating. His heart even skipped a beat like a schoolgirl with a crush (which, honestly, isn\u2019t that far off of a description) as he stared at Iwaizumi\u2019s name, complete with a candid photo of Seijou\u2019s ace. After the fourth ring, Oikawa lifted his phone tentatively from its place next to his pillow and cleared his throat before answering.\n\u201cIwa-chan,\u201d Oikawa began, still a bit drowsy, \u201cI know you plan to live with a plain face forever, but some of us need our beauty sleep,\u201d he teased.\nThere was no response from Iwaizumi\u2019s side for a while and after his state of sleepiness had faded away, Oikawa could recognize the sound of people and raucous music in the background. He heard cheering in the background and glass shattering before he heard a familiar cough at the receiver. Oikawa suddenly found himself torn between being sort of weirded out that Iwaizumi was at an actual party and being offended that he didn\u2019t invite Oikawa.\n\u201cIwa-chan?\u201d Oikawa said, lifting himself on his elbows and gathering his pillow to rest his chin. \u201cIf you\u2019re not there I\u2019m gonna hang\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHello?\u201d the familiar tone of Iwaizumi\u2019s voice came through the phone. \u201cWho\u2019s\u2026? Whaddya want from me?\u201d Iwaizumi asked, his words slurred together in a mess of a sentence that Oikawa could hardly make out.\n\u201cIwaizumi Hajime,\u201d Oikawa said slowly, a smile stretching on his lips, \u201care you drunk?\u201d\n\u201cWho me? Hell no\u2026 I\u2019m sober super\u2026 Super sober\u2026\u201d Iwaizumi trailed off before letting out a loud burp that made Oikawa wrinkle his nose instinctively. Iwaizumi let out a small chuckle that makes Oikawa\u2019s heart throb. \u201cOkay, maybe I\u2019m kinda bzzt\u2026 buzzed\u2026 like a bee or something.\u201d\n\u201cL-like a bee?\u201d Oikawa managed to repeat, trying to stifle his laughter unsuccessfully.\n\u201cYeah, like a\u2014hey, who d\u2019ya think your laughing at?\u201d Iwaizumi growled through the phone. \u201cWho the fuck are you anyway? Why\u2019re you callin\u2019 me? Do you know what fuckin\u2019 time it is? It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s time for me to get another beer\u2014that\u2019s what time it is.\u201d\nOikawa rolled onto his back, his hand over his mouth as he laughed\u2014there was no way he was going to let Iwaizumi live this one down. He only wished he was actually there to experience the miraculously inebriated Iwa-chan in person. And, goodness, Iwaizumi chuckled. It was adorable\u2014Iwaizumi was going to kill Oikawa as soon as the setter so much as mentions this tomorrow, but it was adorable and definitely 100% worth it.\nThere was a rustling on the other end as Oikawa heard Iwaizumi turn from the phone. \u201cHey, Megumi! Get me \u2018nother!\u201d\nOikawa frowned. Oh, Megumi\u2014the Iwaizumi cousin he didn\u2019t like. He supposed he could understand why Iwaizumi didn\u2019t tell him about, the party now, but he still couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit miffed that he wasn\u2019t at least offered an invitation.\n\u201cWell, you called me first,\u201d Oikawa said as he heard the sound of a bottle cap pop from Iwaizumi\u2019s end and a sloshing noise as Iwaizumi took a long swig of beer. Oikawa never really understood how Iwaizumi could do that\u2014he had always thought beer itself was kind of gross. At the end of it, Iwaizumi let out another loud belch. \u201cGoodness, no wonder you\u2019re still single.\u201d\n\u201cPiss off,\u201d Iwaizumi said into the phone with no actual malice. \u201cMy singleness isn\u2019t your business\u2026 whoever you are.\u201d\nOikawa blinked in confusion. \u201c\u2019Whoever you\u2014\u2018 Iwa-chan, do you know who I\u2014\u201c\n\u201cActually,\u201d Iwaizumi interrupted him, his speaking beginning to turn into slurred mumbling, \u201csince you\u2019re already here, I\u2019ve got\u2014I\u2019ve\u2026 I need some advice.\u201d\nFor a moment, Oikawa wondered if he should tell Iwaizumi who he was before the poor boy humiliated himself further. However, as he clutched a pillow against his chest with a wide grin on his face, he decided going along with it was way funnier. \u201cAlright, Hajime-kun,\u201d Oikawa replied in a sing-song voice. \u201cWhat wise knowledge should I bestow upon you on this drunken night?\u201d\n\u201cAlright, so\u2026\u201d Iwaizumi began, \u201cthere\u2019s this\u2026 this person\u2026\u201d\nOikawa felt the smile tugging at his lips disappear in less than a second and a pang in his chest. \u201cA person?\u201d Oikawa repeated, forcing himself to sound as cheery as he did before.\n\u201cYeah, and they\u2019re\u2014they\u2019re like\u2026\u201d Iwaizumi trails off for a second and Oikawa can hear him sighing into the phone. There\u2019s a pause before Iwaizumi continued. \u201cThey\u2019re turning me into a fuckin\u2019 mess, dude.\u201d\n\u201cWow, she must be pretty special if you\u2019re swooning,\u201d Oikawa said with a laugh that he can hardly manage. He rolled onto his side and brought his knees closer to him.\nIwaizumi scoffed over the phone. \u201c\u2019She\u2019? Nah, I\u2019m talking about more of a \u2018he.\u2019\u201d\nOikawa\u2019s eyes widened and he sat up, his phone pressed firmly to his ear. \u201c\u2019He\u2019?\u201d Oikawa parroted back. He hadn\u2019t even known Iwaizumi was into boys. Faces popped into Oikawa\u2019s mind as he tried to think of every boy he had ever seen Iwaizumi interact with, only to reject them as possible candidates to Iwaizumi\u2019s affections. Sure, Iwaizumi didn\u2019t tell him everything, but Oikawa wasn\u2019t dense enough to miss anyone who could possibly turn Iwaizumi into a swooning mess. \u201cIs he on the Seijou volleyball team?\u201d Oikawa asked.\n\u201cYeah, and he\u2019s like so good, lemme just tell ya,\u201d Iwaizumi replied, stopping to take another sip of his beer.\nOikawa pouted, bring his knees up to his chest. Well that gave him absolutely nothing\u2014everyone in Aoba Jousai was good at volleyball, he knew that personally. \u201cTell me more,\u201d Oikawa urged, his curiosity getting the best of him.\n\u201cWell, first of all, let\u2019s get something clear,\u201d Iwaizumi began, his voice sounding gravely serious, \u201cbecause like this is\u2014this is very important, got it?\u201d Oikawa found himself nodding in the dark at no one. Iwaizumi sighed again, more out of exhaustion this time than fondness. \u201cHe is the biggest pain in the ass I have ever had the misfortune of dealing with.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Oikawa answered simply, a bit confused at first before realization hit him like a ton of bricks. The setter\u2019s mouth fell open and his eyes grew wide. \u201cOh,\u201d he said again, mostly to himself. A grin spreads on the setter\u2019s face, stretching from ear to ear as his heart seemed to soar.\nYou see, Oikawa Tooru may not be a genius, but he certainly wasn\u2019t that dense.\n\u201cIs that so, Hajime-kun?\u201d Oikawa purred into the phone.\n\u201cYeah, like h-holy shit, I\u2019ve had to pull this guy\u2019s ass out of trouble at least ten\u2014ten thousand times. Probably,\u201d Iwaizumi said with a groan. \u201cHe keeps overworking himself all the fucking time\u2014you know? And he doesn\u2019t even believe how good he is and it makes me just\u2014I just want him to know how good he is, you know? Like, he\u2019s the best player I know, holy shit, he\u2019s amazing.\u201d\n\u201cYou really think so?\u201d Oikawa asked.\n\u201cYeah, he is. He really, really is,\u201d Iwaizumi insisted. He takes another deep breath and there\u2019s a pause. \u201cBut I feel so fuckin\u2019 bad every time he hurts himself or something you know? Or you know when he feels like he\u2019s inade-inade\u2014\u201c Iwaizumi stumbled over his words, \u201cwhen he doesn\u2019t feel like he\u2019s enough\u2014and I kind of just wanna tell him he\u2019s more than enough\u2014like, he\u2019s perfect.\u201d\nOikawa bit his lip, and his heart pounded in his chest. He could feel himself tearing up just the slightest bit, and for now he was going to chalk it up to the fact that it was really early in the morning, but Iwaizumi\u2019s words made Oikawa feel warm.\n\u201cThe fucking asshole\u2014he probably doesn\u2019t even know how much I worry about him all the time. God, it\u2019s so embarrassing,\u201d Iwaizumi continued with another exasperated sigh.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he does,\u201d Oikawa said, his voice soft and fond.\n\u201cAnd holy shit you know what, he\u2019s so fucking pretty?\u201d Iwaizumi said in a way that was more of a question than a statement. \u201cOh man, he\u2019s so pretty, it\u2019s probably illegal. No one should be born that fuckin\u2019 gorgeous, alright\u2014it\u2019s unfair.\u201d\nOikawa pressed a hand to his mouth as the setter laughed. \u201cIs he really?\u201d Oikawa hummed. \u201cTell me, Hajime-kun, how gorgeous is he?\u201d\nIwaizumi let out a laugh and whistled. \u201cOh boy, where do I even begin with this guy,\u201d he said. \u201cLike, he\u2019s got the nicest fucking hair I\u2019ve ever seen on a person. It is so brown and so soft-looking and he makes me want to run my hands through it. It\u2019s so nice. Y\u2019know you\u2019d think he styles it or something with, like, curlers or some weird shit, but no\u2014it\u2019s fucking natural. I\u2019ve hung out with this kid for my whole fucking life and his hair only gets nicer with age. What the fuck is with that?\nAnd his eyes\u2026 Don\u2019t even get me fucking started on his eyes. They\u2019re this really\u2026 really nice shade of brown and I could look at them all day, y\u2019know? And when he is proud of himself or he\u2019s really happy they just like, light up like a fucking Christmas tree and they\u2019re so big and it\u2019s kind of cute, honestly. But he\u2019s always talkin\u2019 about getting color contacts or something \u2018cause he doesn\u2019t like them or something, but they\u2019re soooo pretty.\u201d\nOikawa buried his face in his knees, not really sure if he could take anymore of this. Part of him wanted to just listen to Iwaizumi compliment him forever and the other part of him was attempting to resist the urge to throw open the window and cheer without any regard to the fact that he\u2019d probably wake the neighborhood because Iwaizumi Hajime had just said, with no hint of irony whatsoever, that he was pretty.\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d Iwaizumi continued. \u201cPlus he\u2019s got the nicest ass I have ever seen on a guy.\u201d\nThat one just made Oikawa laugh, his face red and his smile wide as ever. \u201cOh my,\u201d Oikawa managed to say through his chuckling fit.\n\u201cYeah, let me tell you, standing behind him in his volleyball shorts is like Christmas, okay\u2014his ass is that nice,\u201d Iwaizumi said before sighing again. \u201cIt\u2019s so nice.\u201d\n\u201cGoodness, Iwa-chan, I didn\u2019t know you could be so daring,\u201d Oikawa teased, not even caring to change up his signature nickname for Iwaizumi this time.\n\u201cOh, aaand,\u201d Iwaizumi began again, his voice growing a bit softer, \u201cand he\u2019s got these really nice lips. They always look so soft and he\u2019s always putting on chapstick or something and I dunno, I think he catches me staring at them sometimes and it\u2019s embarrassing as shit, but they\u2019re so\u2026 They\u2019re really...\u201d Iwaizumi trailed off and Oikawa found himself holding his breath, clinging to Iwaizumi\u2019s words and a sigh that sounded almost too sad for him to bear. It\u2019s familiar, not just because Oikawa knew Iwaizumi so well, but because the setter himself had let that same sigh fall from his lips one too many times in the past.\n\u201cI want to kiss him,\u201d Iwaizumi said so softly that Oikawa almost didn\u2019t catch it. \u201cI really want to kiss him just once in my life, then I\u2019ll be okay. Oh man, how do you tell your best friend that you want to kiss him?\u201d\nOikawa\u2019s heart throbbed and his smile softened. \u201cWell, Iwa-chan, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he hummed. \u201cMaybe you should just tell him how you feel?\u201d\n\u201cHell no,\u201d Iwaizumi answered so quickly. \u201cHell fucking no\u2014he\u2019d laugh so fucking hard it\u2019d be humiliating.\u201d\nOikawa frowned at this, kind of miffed that Iwaizumi would think that Oikawa would so easily make fun of him like that. Okay, well maybe he would laugh just a little, but it wouldn\u2019t be that bad.\n\u201cWell, then maybe you should start by being nice to him,\u201d Oikawa said with a slight pout on his lips. \u201cHe\u2019ll probably like you more if you\u2019re nice to him.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a scoff at the other end of the line, but Iwaizumi doesn\u2019t really object to the notion. \u201cYou think so?\u201d he said instead.\n\u201cMhmm,\u201d Oikawa hummed. \u201cAnd you know what, while you\u2019re at it, you should take him to that restaurant he\u2019s always talking about\u2014the expensive one in town with the lobster.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Iwaizumi said. \u201cYeah, maybe.\u201d\n\u201cOh, or you could take him to see that movie about the aliens that you said was stupid because you wanted to watch Godzilla,\u201d Oikawa continued, playfully. \u201cHe\u2019d like that for sure.\u201d\n\u201cYou know what,\u201d Iwaizumi replied, \u201cyeah\u2014I think I\u2019ll do that.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d Oikawa said with a satisfied grin.\n\u201cYeah, thanks man, you\u2019re a great listener,\u201d Iwaizumi said, his words became clearer as he began to sober up. \u201cThanks a lot.\u201d\n\u201cNo problem,\u201d Oikawa sung into the phone.\n\u201cWho is this anyway?\u201d Iwaizumi finally asked.\nOikawa\u2019s proud grin grew mischievous as he crossed his legs under his blanket. \u201cOikawa Tooru,\u201d he replied, making sure his voice was clear and simple.\nThere is a long pause and Oikawa can practically hear the gears moving in Iwaizumi\u2019s head as the pieces finally began to connect.\n\u201cShit,\u201d Iwaizumi finally said. There was a click and suddenly the sounds of the party and the music disappeared and Oikawa was just met with a dead phone tone. Oikawa dissolved in laughter, dropping his phone on the bed as he falls back on his bed, totally elated. You know, this was a really good night for him\u2014Iwaizumi should call first more often.\nHowever, after laughing himself breathless, Oikawa found himself staring blankly at his ceiling, still enveloped in darkness. Iwaizumi\u2019s words playing in his mind over and over like a record. His chest felt tight and his mind raced, wondering how he was going to confront Iwaizumi about it tomorrow. Should he just play it cool and drop hints? Should he kiss him? Should he suggest that they make it official? Would Iwaizumi even remember, after all he was drunk enough not to know he was calling Oikawa the entire time.\nAfter a while, Oikawa began to realize that he was very much awake.\nHe sat back up, checking his phone again to see that it was now 3AM. He wondered if Iwaizumi had gone home yet\u2014knowing his cousin, she\u2019d probably just leave Iwaizumi to pass out on the couch and wake up in the morning hung-over and in pain.\nMaybe he should pick him up.\nOikawa threw the blankets off of himself and grabbed his Aoba Jousai jacket off of his chair. He crept down the stairs quietly, careful not to wake his parents, and grabbing his car keys from the kitchen counter as he walked out the door.\nThe drive from Oikawa\u2019s house to Iwaizumi\u2019s cousin\u2019s was a short one. It was just a few neighborhoods down, actually, and Oikawa knew the road like the back of his hand from spending so much time with Iwaizumi as a child and, by extension, Iwaizumi\u2019s annoying cousin. Oikawa didn\u2019t think much of her other than the fact that she was generally irresponsible and selfish and sometimes reminded Oikawa of what he might be, and that didn\u2019t sit well with him.\nSure enough, when Oikawa pulled into the neighborhood, he could still hear music blaring even this late at night and the road was littered with cars. Oikawa was lucky enough to find a spot relatively close to the house. As Oikawa shuffled towards the door, he noticed that there are drunk college students all over the place, littered on the lawn and whooping for no reason. It was a wonder how no one had called the cops yet, but Oikawa pushed the thought out of his head\u2014he\u2019d hate for Iwaizumi to actually be involved in this mess.\nHe reached out to ring the bell, but the door swung open before he so much as touched it and he jumped back at the sight of a girl leaning against the door, a bottle of vodka in one hand. She was laughing drunkenly and her dark hair swished back and forth as she tried to stand up straight. Her face was furiously flushed and, when she looked up at Oikawa, it took her a moment before she recognized him.\n\u201cOh my gosh, is this little Tooru?\u201d she said, giggling. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in, like, centuries or whatever.\u201d\nOikawa forced a smile and gave her a wave. \u201cHi, Megumi, I\u2019m just here to pick up Iwa-chan.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean, me \u2018Iwa-chan\u2019 or Hajime \u2018Iwa-chan\u2019?\u201d she teased and Oikawa winced at her obvious attempt at flirting with him. He wondered if it would be an appropriate time to mention that he was much more interested in several ways in her younger cousin right now, but decided against it for the sake of timeliness.\n\u201cI definitely mean Hajime,\u201d Oikawa insisted, looking behind her to try to see if he could find him.\n\u201cYeah, I figured, Hajime\u2019s been talkin\u2019 about you all night, y\u2019know?\u201d Megumi said with a laugh. She shot him a mischievous glance. \u201cYou guys aren\u2019t like, datin\u2019 or somethin\u2019, are ya?\u201d\n\u201cWho knows,\u201d Oikawa answered, squeezing past her quickly, \u201cPardon the intrusion.\u201d\nOikawa power walks through the house, stepping over passed out party goers and cups scattered on the floor. He is lucky enough to spot Iwaizumi quickly enough on the couch, cans of beer at his feet and his face flushed as he downed another one. He doesn\u2019t even notice Oikawa until the setter is right in front of him.\nIwaizumi looked up at him slowly and gives him the sternest glare that Oikawa had ever seen on his face (which was really saying something). \u201cIf you\u2019re here to laugh at me, I\u2019ll punch you in the nose,\u201d Iwaizumi said with no real intent of action behind his words as usual.\nOikawa offers him a hand. \u201cC\u2019mon, Iwa-chan, I\u2019m taking you home.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t wanna go home with you, asshole,\u201d Iwaizumi said stubbornly.\n\u201cToo bad, let\u2019s go,\u201d Oikawa reached out for Iwaizumi\u2019s arm and, despite his deep frown, Iwaizumi ends up taking his hand anyway. He\u2019s unsteady on his feet and almost immediately falls over as he stands, so Oikawa puts his hand around Iwaizumi\u2019s waist to keep him steady and lets the ace put his arm around his shoulder.\nThe walk out of the house and to the car was eerily silent. Iwaizumi didn\u2019t even look at Oikawa and his fists were clenched into tight fists. Oikawa immediately felt guilty for messing with Iwaizumi on the phone, but he figured it probably wasn\u2019t that mean, right? He was at least thankful that the car ride back to Iwaizumi\u2019s place was relatively short. As he pulled into the driveway, he turned to Iwaizumi, who was leaning back in his seat, massaging his forehead, feeling thankful that he doesn\u2019t look like he was going to throw up in Oikawa\u2019s car anytime soon.\n\u201cDo you have your keys?\u201d Oikawa asked.\nIwaizumi groaned as he moved to reach into his pockets. After a few feeble attempts at feeling around for them, Iwaizumi slumped back in his seat. \u201cFuck, I left it at Megumi\u2019s,\u201d he said.\nOikawa gave a thoughtful hum, drumming his fingers against the steering wheel. \u201cAre your parents home?\u201d he finally asked after a while.\nIwaizumi laughed weakly. \u201cYeah, \u2018cause I\u2019d be drinking at Megumi\u2019s place if my parents were in town.\u201d\n\u201cAlright, Mr. Sarcastic, hold on,\u201d Oikawa said, exiting his car and walking over to the passenger side to help Iwaizumi. Although his feet were now a bit firmer on the ground, Oikawa could still feel Iwaizumi\u2019s unsteadiness leaning into him as they walked around the house to the backdoor, which Oikawa knows just how to jostle to get it open after years of sneaking into Iwaizumi\u2019s house in the dead of the night. Sure enough, after a few shakes, Oikawa managed to get it open with one hand. \u201cWow, Iwa-chan, you should really get that fixed\u2014we wouldn\u2019t want someone to break into your house or something,\u201d Oikawa quipped, shooting Iwaizumi a smile, poking the other boy\u2019s side with the hand that was on his waist.\nIwaizumi didn\u2019t look back at him and just gave him a simple \u201chm\u201d in reply and Oikawa pouted. He closed the back door before hauling Iwaizumi up the stairs to the bedroom, not bothering to turn on the lights to navigate a hallway he knew like the back of his hand. When they got to Iwaizumi\u2019s room, Oikawa finally felt the need to speak up again.\n\u201cIwa-chan,\u201d the setter began as he set Iwaizumi down on his bed, taking a seat next to him. He leaned forward to rest his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands as he peaked at Iwaizumi, who was looking away from him. \u201cIwa-chan, are you mad at me?\u201d\nIwaizumi fell onto his side, grabbing a pillow and covering his face with it. \u201cFuck off, Asskawa,\u201d came his muffled reply.\n\u201cAw, Iwa-chan,\u201d Oikawa whined, leaning over where Iwaizumi\u2019s face is supposed to be. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I pretended not to be me,\u201d he said with a pout, poking the pillow persistently, \u201cbut you were just so cute\u2014\u201c\n\u201cI told you to fuck off,\u201d Iwaizumi said, swatting Oikawa\u2019s hand away.\n\u201cIwa-chan, don\u2019t be mad at me, pleeease,\u201d Oikawa pleaded. He positioned himself to lay down next to Iwaizumi, leaning in close. \u201cWill you forgive me if I let you kiss me?\u201d\nOikawa is met with a face full of pillow that makes him splutter and the bed shifts next to him. Suddenly, the mattress sank around his head. When he lifted the pillow off of his face, he looked up to see Iwaizumi\u2019s face hovering over him. The flush in his cheeks from the alcohol spread all over his face and ears Oikawa could even discern it in the tanned skin of Iwaizumi\u2019s arms next to him. Iwaizumi\u2019s eyebrows were furrowed and his mouth was open, as if he was trying to look for the right words to say. He could smell the alcohol in Iwaizumi\u2019s breath and the heat radiating from his skin.\n\u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you?\u2019 Iwaizumi finally said after a while, his voice cracking the slightest bit.\n\u201cWell, according to you I\u2019m \u2018a pain in the ass\u2019,\u201d Oikawa replied with a shrug.\n\u201cStop joking around\u2014you know what I mean.\u201d\n\u201c\u2019Fraid not, Iwa-chan\u2014you\u2019re going to have to be a bit more\u2014\u201c\n\u201cWhy the hell would you mess with me like that,\u201d Iwaizumi interrupted him. \u201cHoly shit, do you know how long I\u2019ve been keeping all of that in? Shit, you were never supposed to know any of that\u2014\u201c\n\u201cIwa-chan,\u201d Oikawa said softly, guilt beginning to gnaw at him.\n\u201c\u2014And I know you seem to lack human decency sometimes,\u201d Iwaizumi continued bitterly, \u201cbut you don\u2019t fucking make fun of someone after they just spilled all of their embarrassing fucking feelings for you all over the goddamn place\u2014\u201c\n\u201cIwa-chan,\u201d Oikawa repeated, a little more clearly this time.\n\u201c\u2014You are such a fucking asshole, I fucking hate you, but I don\u2019t actually hate you and that makes me really hate you\u2014\u201c\n\u201cIwa-chan!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Iwaizumi finally answered.\nOikawa reached up to curl his fingers into Iwaizumi\u2019s shirt and pulls him closer. Their lips smashed together sloppily and their teeth clink against each other. Oikawa realized that their first kiss probably could have gone better\u2014maybe less nose smashing and less of that beer taste that lingered in Iwaizumi\u2019s mouth, but as they pulled apart and Oikawa saw Iwaizumi looking more confused than frustrated and his forehead pressed against Oikawa\u2019s, he also figured that this was probably fine as well.\nThere\u2019s a moment of silence and Oikawa crossed his fingers, hoping that he got the message across, before Iwaizumi sneered at him.\n\u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d he said, his voice raspy. \u201cWhy the hell would you do that? You\u2019re an asshole.\u201d\n\u201cOh my god, Iwa-chan,\u201d Oikawa closed his eyes and sighed in exasperation, his fingers still curled in Iwaizumi\u2019s shirt. \u201cYou\u2019re so dense, I can\u2019t believe this.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201c\n\u201cHajime,\u201d Oikawa lowered his voice and his eyes fluttered open to meet Iwaizumi\u2019s gaze. His heart hammered in his chest and he bit his lip. His throat felt dry and his voice is almost lost, but Oikawa went on anyway, determined to get this into Iwaizumi\u2019s thick skull once and for all.\n\u201cI love you.\u201d\nIwaizumi woke up to the biggest headache he had ever felt in his life and a light to bright creeping through the open doorway of his bedroom. He groaned and rolled over onto his side to see that his blanket had been disturbed as if someone had just woken up and gotten out of them. Iwaizumi stared at them blankly for a moment, not really registering his situation, until the events of last night hit him like a brick.\nIwaizumi felt his face burn as he remembered bits and pieces that fit together like some horrible puzzle that he never wanted to finish. The phone call, copious amounts of alcohol, and Oikawa Tooru\u2014that was the worst fucking combination he had ever thought about in his life.\n\n\u201cHajime, I love you.\u201d\n\nThat was the last piece that he remembered before he had woken up and he instantly wanted to curl up and burn rather than face whatever the hell had happened last night. How was he going to talk to Oikawa? Where was the bastard anyway? How far did they go because, as much as Iwaizumi had fantasized about banging his best friend, he\u2019d rather remember it, thank you very much.\nIwaizumi heard footsteps from down the hall and he threw the blanket over his head as they stopped in the doorway.\n\u201cMorning, Iwa-chan,\u201d Oikawa\u2019s voice, bright and cheery, rung through the room much too loudly for Iwaizumi\u2019s hung-over liking. \u201cI thought you might be awake, so I brought you some water and aspirin for that meanie hangover you\u2019ve got there.\u201d\n\u201cOh my god, if you\u2019re going to run your mouth, please at least do it quietly,\u201d Iwaizumi said, peeking out of his blanket just a bit to glare at Oikawa, who approached him with the aforementioned hangover chasers.\n\u201cSo grumpy, Iwa-chan,\u201d Oikawa pouted as he leaned over the side of Iwaizumi\u2019s bed, holding out the glass of water and painkillers for him. \u201cHere, Iwa-chan, you\u2019ll feel better if you take this.\u201d\nIwaizumi grumbled as he forced himself to sit up, but he took the water and aspirin with a small thanks. Right after he drank his water, Oikawa leaned over to brush his lips gently against Iwaizumi\u2019s forehead. Iwaizumi felt his face heat up immediately as Oikawa laughed at his expression, sitting on the floor and resting his head on the edge of Iwaizumi\u2019s bed.\n\u201cThe aspirin\u2019s working already, Iwa-chan\u2014you were so pale before and now you\u2019re red as a tomato,\u201d Oikawa teased.\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Iwaizumi said, chugging the rest of his water, feeling instant relief at the coolness in his throat.\nThey sit in silence as the two both tried to think of what to say\u2014or maybe it was just Iwaizumi trying to think of what to say and Oikawa was just looking up at him expectantly. He\u2019s not really sure because Iwaizumi avoided Oikawa\u2019s eyes for a second as billions of questions ran through his mind.\nHowever, after what seemed like forever, Iwaizumi finally cleared his throat. \u201cSo,\u201d he began. \u201cWhat, er\u2014what happened last night?\u201d\nOikawa\u2019s lips curled into a frown as he looked up at Iwaizumi. \u201cYou don\u2019t remember?\u201d he asked.\nIwaizumi ran a hand through his hair and let it rest at the back of his neck. \u201cI remember bits and pieces.\u201d\nOikawa hummed thoughtfully. \u201cDo you remember the phone call?\u201d\nIwaizumi felt humiliation wash over him like a wave and he buried his face in his hands. \u201cUgh, yeah, I remember that.\u201d\n\u201cDo you remember me picking you up?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cDo you remember yelling at me?\u201d\n\u201cA little.\u201d\nThere was a pause and Iwaizumi almost didn\u2019t hear Oikawa when he spoke. \u201cDo you remember me telling you that I love you?\u201d Oikawa asked.\nIwaizumi peeked through his fingers to see Oikawa leaning his head on his arms, tilting it slightly to the side in a way that was too cute for it to be legal. \u201cY-yeah,\u201d Iwaizumi mumbled. Oikawa\u2019s face lit up at Iwaizumi\u2019s reply. \u201cI don\u2019t remember anything after that, though.\u201d\n\u201cOh, well, that\u2019s understandable,\u201d Oikawa said, \u201cbecause you passed out right after my confession.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Oikawa put a hand over his heart dramatically. \u201cYou must really like me a lot. Iwa-chan, to swoon as soon as I said the l-word.\u201d\n\u201cShut up, alright? I was drunk.\u201d\n\u201cIwa-chan, be honest with yourself,\u201d Oikawa said, poking Iwaizumi\u2019s leg with his finger. \u201cYou just love me that much.\u201d\n\u201cOh my god, please stop.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just updating you on the events of last night like you asked, Iwa-chan,\u201d Oikawa said innocently. \u201cYou even proposed to me, you know.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, I know I didn\u2019t do that, I wasn\u2019t that drunk.\u201d\n\u201cNope, you definitely proposed to me,\u201d Oikawa insisted with a laugh. \u201cIt was so romantic\u2014you got down on one knee and everything.\u201d\n\u201cNope, no I didn\u2019t,\u201d Iwaizumi said, swatting Oikawa\u2019s hand away. \u201cWhy the hell would I do that?\u201d\nOikawa\u2019s eyes glinted with something mischievous and Iwaizumi immediately felt regret for asking as Oikawa opened his mouth to reply.\n\u201cBecause,\u201d he began with a sly smile, \u201cyou think I\u2019m pretty.\u201d\n\u201cOh my god.\u201d\n\u201cAnd because you think my hair is really soft and you like my eyes,\u201d Oikawa continued.\n\u201cPlease stop.\u201d\n\u201cAnd goodness, Iwa-chan, the things you said about my ass,\u201d Oikawa smirked, but fanned himself mockingly. \u201cHow forward of you.\u201d\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t doing this right now.\u201d\n\u201cOh oh, and do you know what you said about my lips?\u201d Oikawa persisted, moving up so that he was now sitting next to Iwaizumi on his bed.\n\u201cDid I say they looked better closed and on the other side of the room,\u201d Iwaizumi quipped. Oikawa pouted and gave him a light jab in the side.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Oikawa said. \u201cYou said you wanted to kiss me at least once in your life.\u201d\nIwaizumi couldn\u2019t even find anything to counter that so he just looked away, his cheeks burning. \u201cWell, I wasn\u2019t lying,\u201d he muttered.\nOikawa\u2019s hands found their way to Iwaizumi\u2019s cheek and he pulled Iwaizumi\u2019s face up to meet his. Iwaizumi gulped as he stared into Oikawa\u2019s eyes, calculating and warm, and he found his throat running dry.\n\u201cJust once, though?\u201d Oikawa asked. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you like to do it again?\u201d\nIwaizumi swore his heart almost burst out of his chest at that moment. He couldn\u2019t even find the words to reply and just nodded, melting as Oikawa gave him a look probably had the power to destroy. Oikawa presses his lips against Iwaizumi\u2019s and it takes Iwaizumi a second before he kisses back, letting their lips glide together and\u2014\n\u201cOuch,\u201d Oikawa pulled back with an incredulous look on his face. \u201cIwa-chan did you just bite my tongue?\u201d\n\u201cS-sorry,\u201d he stammered in his embarrassment.\n\u201cHm, yeah we\u2019ve got to work on that,\u201d Oikawa said, scratching his chin thoughtfully. He then smiled and cupped Iwaizumi\u2019s face in his hands. Iwaizumi was rendered motionless as Oikawa pressed his lips to Iwaizumi\u2019s forehead and then moved back down to press their foreheads together. He looked into Iwaizumi\u2019s eyes with such genuineness and fondness that Iwaizumi began to wonder if he was dreaming, but Iwaizumi let a small smile curl on his lips as Oikawa gives him a quick peck.\n\u201cIwa-chan,\u201d Oikawa said.\n\u201cHm?\u201d\n\u201cYou should call me when you\u2019re drunk more often.\u201d\n\u201cPlease leave.\u201d"
