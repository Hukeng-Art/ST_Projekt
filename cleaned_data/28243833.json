    "text": "\u00a0\nShouta sighs, pinching the bridge of his nose as he stands before his class.\n\u00a0\nThey look at him, waiting expectantly for him to start talking, but all he can think about is sleep. He glances briefly at his sleeping bag and then he squares his shoulders and turns back to the class.  Let\u2019s get this over with then .\n\u00a0\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be an essay writing competition.\u201d he announces to his students. For a few seconds there is only silence and then the chaos begins. Shouta sighs (again), sneaking another longing glance at his sleeping bag.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSensei, that\u2019s not a very hero activity or competition.\u201d Kaminari frowns.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re not in middle school sensei! Why are we doing this?\u201d Ashido whines immediately after.\n\u00a0\nShouta gauges the reaction of the rest of the class. Bakugou sits slouched, eyes drawn to the window, he\u2019s hardly bothered. Behind him, Midoriya is muttering under his breath. Todoroki remains impassive as ever while both Yaoyorozu and Iida seem to be silently contemplating something. The rest of the students have already started engaging in conversations amongst themselves.  This is exactly what he had expected.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nShouta closes his eyes for a bare second and then reopens them, glaring at the class, flashing red \u201cQuiet.\u201d The class falls silent immediately and Shouta prides himself on still having a firm hold on his students.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNedzu thought it would be a fun competition for you kids, a break from normal hero activities.\u201d Shouta explains, looking pointedly at Kaminari and Ashido.\n\u00a0\nBefore any of them can interrupt him again, he continues gruffly \u201cIt\u2019s not mandatory for everyone to participate.\u201d\n\u00a0\nA collective sigh of relief is heard and then Iida raises his hand. Shouta stops himself from rolling his eyes \u201cYes Iida?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIs this competition only for the hero course students sensei?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo.\u201d Shouta shakes his head \u201cStudents from all courses are allowed to participate, but the topic for each course will be different. Hence, each course will have a separate judging criteria and a winner.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank you sensei.\u201d Iida bows and then takes a seat.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe topic will be on spot, no preparation time whatsoever. Put your hand up if you want to participate.\u201d Shouta waits with a tired expression, but internally he hopes that the student he needs will put his hand up voluntarily, otherwise this will be embarrassing for the both of them. He watches as Iida\u2019s and Yaoyorozu\u2019s hand goes up, the other students look around to see who\u2019s participating and Shouta waits for a few more minutes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen no new hands raise up, he nods once and then jots their names onto the sheet of paper he\u2019d been given \u201cIida, Yaoyorozu, I\u2019ve written your names down.\u201d he pauses, lets silence settle in the air for a moment and then he says \u201cMidoriya I\u2019m writing down your name too.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMidoriya\u2019s eyes widen as big as saucers and then he begins to wave his hands around \u201c What? Sensei - I didn\u2019t - why - \u201d\n\u00a0\nShouta cuts him off immediately, \u201cNedzu said so.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIf Shouta thought Midoriya\u2019s eyes couldn\u2019t widen more, he\u2019s proved wrong as the green haired boy stares at him, dumbstruck with his jaw hanging open \u201cHuh?\u201d he says intelligently, blinking at Shouta.\n\u00a0\nShouta sees Bakugou throw Midoriya an irritated glare, but he doesn\u2019t do or say anything else. The rest of the class glances between him and Midoriya.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou tell me problem child.\u201d Shouta responds dryly, raising an eyebrow. But Midoriya looks as clueless as Shouta had felt in Nedzu\u2019s office. So this is one of the principal\u2019s  damn  schemes after all.  Why does it always have to be his problem child? \n\u00a0\nShouta sighs, rubbing his face as he recalls the conversation with Nedzu from earlier\n\u00a0\n\n \u201cIs this competition really necessary?\u201d Shouta asks plainly. \n\n\u00a0\n\n \u201cAizawa-kun, they won\u2019t miss classes and it\u2019s not mandatory participation anyway. Why are you against it?\u201d The principal watches him with an amused expression. \n\n\u00a0\n\n \u201cIt\u2019s a useless competition and takes time out of their weekend.\u201d Aizawa replies, his coffee untouched. \n\n\u00a0\n\n \u201cYou\u2019ve gone soft.\u201d Nedzu\u2019s smile grows wider. \n\n\u00a0\n\n \u201cI have not.\u201d Aizawa snaps immediately \u201cThere\u2019s no logic to hosting this competition.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n \u201cYes, there is.\u201d Nedzu hums. \n\n\u00a0\n\n \u201cWell do enlighten me then.\u201d Shouta folds his arms, staring at the principal. \n\n\u00a0\n\n Nedzu grins and Shouta immediately stiffens. He knows that look, the mouse was scheming something again. \n\n\u00a0\n\n \u201cNedzu,\u201d he says in a warning tone. \n\n\u00a0\n\n \u201cAll in due time Aizawa-kun.\u201d Nedzu waves him off, taking another sip of the tea. \n\n\u00a0\n\n \u201cFine, have it your way then. Only two students will participate from my class anyway.\u201d Shouta takes a sip of his coffee. \n\n\u00a0\n\n \u201cIida Tenya and Yaoyorozu Momo, correct?\u201d Nedzu asks, a glint in his eyes. \n\n\u00a0\n\n \u201cYes.\u201d Shouta grits his teeth as he answers. \n\n\u00a0\n\n \u201cI have a single condition that your participant list must meet.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n Shouta simply arches an eyebrow. \n\n\u00a0\n\n \u201cMidoriya Izuku will have to participate, regardless of whether he volunteers or not.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n \u201cProblem child?\u201d Shouta frowns \u201cWhy?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n \u201cAll in due time Aizawa-kun, all in due time.\u201d Nedzu repeats simply. \n\n\u00a0\nThe bell rings, shaking Shouta out of his thoughts and he exits the classroom grumbling about how he never managed to sneak in a nap. Hizashi passes by him, and gives him a comforting pat on the shoulder as he walks into the class for English. When Shouta\u2019s around the corner, a good distance away from the class, the corridor quiet with only him, he turns to the nearest security camera glaring as he hisses \u201cIf anything happens to problem child because of you, I will murder you.\u201d The red light of the camera blinks twice in acknowledgement and Shouta walks away, his mood not having improved in the slightest.\n\u00a0\nShouta drops the topic after that and in between grading papers, managing the hell class and hero work, he very nearly forgets about the competition itself. Until the day of the competition.\n\u00a0\nIt lasts for an hour, with a minimum word count of three hundred and fifty words and then his three students are back in the dorms. He catches only Iida who explains that Yayorozu met up with Jiro directly after the competition while Midoriya had already gone back upstairs to his room. Shouta frowns at the mention of Midoriya, but doesn\u2019t comment. Instead he focuses on the student present in front of him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat was the topic?\u201d he asks, mostly out of curiosity.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe had to write about our favourite hero.\u201d Iida beams.\n\u00a0\nShouta nods in understanding, his lips twitching in amusement as he buries his face underneath his captured weapon. Iida would have written about Ingenium no doubt.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI chose Ingenium.\u201d Iida says and then scratches the back of his neck awkwardly\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you had fun writing the essay.\u201d Shouta responds, and then he dismisses him after that.\n\u00a0\nNow it definitely makes sense as to why Nedzu would want Midoriya to participate. No doubt, the kid would have written about All Might and he was armed with a lifetime of knowledge for the topic anyway. Shouta had very briefly glimpsed at Midoriya\u2019s analysis notebooks and he had been impressed,  very impressed . The grin Nedzu had given him after going through a few pages of one of the notebooks, had Shouta\u2019s blood run cold. Whatever Nedzu was planning, these two events were definitely connected.\n\u00a0\nThe weekend passes by without any major incidents (to Shouta\u2019s relief) and when Monday comes, uneasiness settles heavily in Shouta\u2019s gut. Over the years, Shouta has learnt to trust his instincts, they were usually right. So when he gets to UA and his stomach practically recoils, he sends a silent prayer hoping it has nothing to do with any of his students.\n\u00a0\nThey have a morning assembly that day and Nedzu announces the winners for the essay competition.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFor the hero course, the winner is Midoriya Izuku.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShouta rolls his eyes and then watches as the class shoves Midoriya to the podium with loud cheers. He lets them enjoy the victory, and he smirks with satisfaction at Vlad\u2019s miserable expression. The kid is wearing an expression of disbelief and shock, but it morphs into a huge smile once he gets onto the stage and a warm feeling of pride spreads through Shouta\u2019s chest, making Shouta stand just a little bit taller.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNedzu presents Midoriya with a trophy and he watches as the principal says something, making Midoriya\u2019s face heat up immediately. Green hues find Shouta\u2019s own dark ones and he watches as Midoriya\u2019s eyes widen at having been caught and he ducks his head embarrassedly. Shouta frowns slightly and wonders what the exchange was about. Instead of mulling over it, he turns to face his students as their yelling gets out of hand.\n\u00a0\nDuring homeroom he addresses the class briefly, having nothing much to say and then distributes their assignment papers. When he passes by Midoriya he says a quiet \u2018 Congratulations .\u2019 Midoriya stiffens ever so slightly, but doesn\u2019t look up at him as he says \u201cThank you sensei.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShouta frowns once more under his capture weapon, alarm bells going off in the back of his head. Something wasn\u2019t adding up. While it was Midoriya\u2019s nature to struggle in accepting compliments, especially from teachers, Shouta sensed equal parts of guilt and embarrassment from Midoriya.  Why? What was the true relationship of Midoriya and All Might, that the kid was behaving this way? \n\u00a0\nShouta asks Iida and Yaoyorozu to take care of the class as he heads back to the staff room, thinking of his sleeping bag. However when he walks in, Nedzu is seated at the center, humming and all the other teachers surround him, excitedly chatting. They all turn to face him with varying expressions from smugness to amusement and Nemuri grins at him like Christmas had come early.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n Oh no, nope, not happening . Shouta doesn\u2019t even hesitate as he does a complete 180 and walks back out of the door. He feels someone grab his arm and drag him back in.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHizashi let me go.\u201d he huffs, trying to get out of his husband\u2019s grip.\n\u00a0\n\u201cShoutaaa don\u2019t lie, you\u2019re curious.\u201d Hizashi smiles at him, it\u2019s soft, making Shouta falter. He mutters a weak \u201cNo, the only thing I am right now is cautious.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHizashi pushes him into a chair and kneels down \u201cYou\u2019re going to love this Sho.\u201d he whispers, expression tender and Shouta wonders what has Hizashi wearing that expression because whatever it is, Shouta\u2019s already a goner and he tries glaring at Nedzu with a  \u2018this is all your fault and I don\u2019t even know what it\u2019s about yet\u2019  look\n\u00a0\nNedzu chuckles in amusement, stepping in front of him as Hizashi steps back. \u201cAren\u2019t you curious as to how Midoriya won the competition Aizawa-kun?\u201d\n\u00a0\nShouta stares at him tiredly and opens his mouth to say \u2018No, not really. I don\u2019t want to read a fanboy essay on All Might. Can I go to sleep already?\u2019 But the words die in his throat as he considers all of the events that have occurred and his eyes narrow in suspicion at Nedzu \u201cYou knew Midoriya would win?\u201d\nNedzu smiles in satisfaction, correcting Shouta \u201cI hoped he would.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Shouta asks, continuing to stare at him.  What game was the rat even playing? \n\u00a0\n\u201cI wanted to test out a theory.\u201d Nedzu says, his eyes gleaming and Shouta represses a groan. He had a feeling that this theory had a lot to do with him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cJust get it over with.\u201d Shouta mutters, burying his face into his hands.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI had a theory that Midoriya Izuku\u2019s favourite hero changed after he enrolled into UA.\u201d\n\u00a0\n That catches Shouta\u2019s attention as his head snaps up to look at Nedzu who smirks at him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShouta frowns \u201cThat doesn\u2019t -  Why? \u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBecause he\u2019s gotten to know me personally.\u201d Shouta is surprised to hear Yagi be the one to respond.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Shouta sighs, he can feel the oncoming of a great headache.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThings changed when he saw my civilian persona. I became more human, more of a parental figure I suppose.\u201d Yagi shrugs, giving him a sheepish look.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re not the only one who\u2019s a parental figure to him.\u201d Nemuri grins slyly at Shouta.\n\u00a0\nBefore Shouta can ask about that, Nedzu places a sheet of paper in front of him with Midoriya\u2019s handwriting. \u201cRead it.\u201d Nedzu says gently and they all move back to him some space, but their gazes remain on him regardless.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFine.\u201d Shouta grunts, resigned as he picks up the paper.\n\u00a0\n\u201c  Heroes aren\u2019t people who don\u2019t get scared, they\u2019re the ones who move despite their fear.  \u201d\n\u00a0\nShouta pauses after the very first line because he recalls saying something similar, if not the very same thing after his debut fight when the press was swarming around him. It was perhaps the first and last time Shouta ever faced the camera\u2019s as Eraserhead. He continues to read, even as he feels his heart beating slightly faster.\n\u00a0\n\n That was one of the sayings that the hero Eraserhead left the world with on the night of his debut fight. As an underground hero, Eraserhead works during the night and avoids making any public appearances. Despite gaining credit (from the police) for the villains he captures, the public never realizes what he does for them. This is just one of the reasons why Eraserhead is my favourite hero. Rather than gaining fame for his work, he chooses the most efficient route to save and protect people with his quirk. \n\n\u00a0\n\n This was some sort of a joke. He was Midoriya\u2019s favourite hero? \n\n\u00a0\nHe looks up, eyes narrowing at Nedzu \u201cThis isn\u2019t funny, give me Midoriya\u2019s real essay.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat do I achieve by lying to you about an essay Aizawa-kun?\u201d Nedzu asks innocently, head tilted to one side \u201cBesides, I\u2019m sure you recognize Midoriya\u2019s style of work.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWhile Shouta did recognize Midoriya\u2019s writing style, the voice in his head wouldn\u2019t allow him to believe it fully. All Might was the kid\u2019s favourite hero, it was a fact etched in stone and facts don\u2019t change. He meets Hizashi\u2019s gaze and Hizashi gives him a firm nod. He breathes in sharply, he needs a drink, maybe more than one. He looks back at the paper, Midoriya\u2019s handwriting swimming in front of him.\n\u00a0\n His quirk is Erasure, as the name suggests, it erases the quirk of anyone he\u2019s looking at .\n\u00a0\nShouta\u2019s lip twitches as he tries to disguise a smile. Midoriya had gone off on a tangent for three paragraphs after that, about his quirk - how it worked, it\u2019s advantages and disadvantages, even about his capture weapon and Shouta recognizes the exact point when Midoriya had realized his off topic ramble and had tried to get back on track.  This kid, honestly.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\n As a late bloomer myself, it was Eraserhead who gave me hope for my future. \n\n\u00a0\nShouta\u2019s breath hitches as he recalls a conversation he had accidentally eavesdropped on between Midoriya and Todoroki early morning on a weekend.\n\u00a0\n\n \u201cI\u2019ve always admired All Might, all of us do.\u201d Midoriya says quietly \u201cEven though I looked up to him, I\u2019ve always known I could never be like him. I hoped, but deep down, I\u2019ve always known I couldn\u2019t be like him.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n \u201cSo you looked up to another hero who made you believe in yourself.\u201d Todoroki says, something akin to understanding. \n\n\u00a0\n\n \u201cYes.\u201d Midoriya whispers. \u201cWhile All Might may be primarily associated with hope, and I mean all heroes generally are right? But this hero...he gave me hope in different ways - to persevere, to endure, to live. For the first time I didn\u2019t do it because \u2018that\u2019s what\u2019s expected of a hero\u2019 or \u2018that\u2019s what All Might would do\u2019. I did it all because he gave me hope that it would be okay one day.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\nShouta wonders if that had been him too and for the first time in many years, he questions his reasoning.  That couldn\u2019t have been him right? \u00a0\n\u00a0\n But logically,  a voice at the back of his head whispers,  if it wasn\u2019t All Might that he looked up to, then logically the hero from the conversation is the one Midoriya would write about.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nMaybe he was overthinking this. Yeah, he definitely was. He ignores the voice in his head and goes back to the essay.\n\u00a0\n\n Eraserhead essentially fights quirkless. His quirk is not a flashy combat quirk but rather evens the playing field against his opponent. And for this reason, his fighting skills are perhaps his greatest asset, combined with his ability to analyse the situation and account for the villain\u2019s own skills, Eraserhead is a hero that villains who\u2019ve come in contact with fear as much as All Might himself. \n\n\u00a0\nShouta is torn between snorting at Midoriya\u2019s exaggeration and trying to hide away in embarrassment for receiving such high praise. He scans the next few lines and he rolls his eyes as another three paragraph rant about his fighting style comes up. It was impressive to say the least, accounting for the fact that Midoriya had witnessed only a handful of fights for observation. He looks up at Nedzu who\u2019s wearing his unsettling grin and Shouta has to resist the urge to immediately ship the problem child off to another continent.\n\u00a0\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t you have deducted points for his off topic rambling?\u201d he questions Nedzu.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh we did.\u201d Cementoss replies instead.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut all the other kids went off topic too.\u201d Snipe continues \u201cPlus, his analysis was quite impressive as compared to what we saw in other papers.\u201d\n\u00a0\nShouta only huffs as he feels another fuzzy feeling of pride pass through him and he goes back to reading the essay again.\n\u00a0\n\n Heroes keep their hero persona and civilian persona as separate as possible and as difficult as it is, sometimes the line between their civilian and hero self blur. Aizawa sensei is Eraserhead as much as Eraserhead is Aizawa sensei.\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0\nShouta raises an eyebrow at that, but continues reading.\n\u00a0\n\n I used sensei in specific here because in most dangerous situations concerning villain attacks related to UA, when Eraserhead jumps into the fray, his brain actually operates as Aizawa Shouta. For someone who is considered as a logical and rational hero, when students are involved in the equation, Eraserhead becomes reckless in the way he throws himself against the villain. The odds of making it out alive don\u2019t matter if the students are safe - this is Aizawa sensei\u2019s train of thought while Eraserhead would argue that \u201cRecklessness is not an appealing and definitely not a good quality of a hero.\u201d In fact, more often than not, if a hero is reckless, then it may cause panic among civilians and even other heroes on the scene to watch a hero bring danger to themselves, \u2018self destruction\u2019 Eraserhead would say. \n\n\u00a0\nGoddamnit problem child. Shouta was torn between being pissed off at himself and at Midoriya. Because the entire damn paragraph was accurate to the dot. It annoyed him to no end because Midoriya had perfectly quoted him from lessons, thrown Shouta\u2019s own words back at him and the brat had the cheek to sound smug while writing it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cQuite the hypocrite aren\u2019t you Aizawa.\u201d Nedzu grins at him cheerfully.\n\u00a0\n\u201cShut up.\u201d Shouta mutters, cheeks heating up ever so lightly.\n\u00a0\n\n Eraserhead knows that heroes aren\u2019t invincible, Aizawa sensei doesn\u2019t care if he isn\u2019t. So somewhere along the line, Eraserhead and Aizawa sensei morphed into a mesh of a singular entity and while he talks to the students as Aizawa sensei, he stands on guard for them as Eraserhead.\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0\nShouta reads the paragraph again and then once more. The kid wasn\u2019t wrong but the fact that Midoriya was able to eloquently put his incredible observation in words made his lips tug up in fondness. He really had grown up from the stuttering first year with a severe lack of self-confidence and esteem.\n\u00a0\n\n Perhaps this would be diverging from the original topic of the paper, but I strongly believe that I cannot appreciate Eraserhead without appreciating Aizawa Shouta as well. While he uses his teaching role as an excuse to stay up late into the night grading papers in the common room, he eases a student\u2019s fears and pain away as a pro-hero who expects the side effects of having mental scars from battles too young for a fifteen-year-old. Both sides are blunt and honest in speech, but one may be a bit more of a parental figure than the other. \n\n\u00a0\nShouta pauses, finger\u2019s gently tracing the word \u2018parental figure\u2019 and he doesn\u2019t realize he\u2019s been mouthing it until Hizashi\u2019s quiet chuckle shakes him out of his reverie.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt only gets better after that.\u201d Hizashi nudges him to continue reading the essay.\n\u00a0\nWhile it was in the persona of Eraserhead that he placed a fist over my heart and nicknamed me \u2018problem child\u2019, it was in the fondness and trust as my teacher that he told me that he\u2019d watch over me, and believed in me. During training, when we spar and hone our abilities with Aizawa sensei, he instructs us as Eraserhead who\u2019s fought and experienced the outside world. Eraserhead, Aizawa Shouta - two sides of the same coin. I\u2019m grateful to him, more than I will ever be able to admit out loud. He is the hero who constantly inspires me, has made me who I am today and he is the one who saved a quirkless teen from giving up on life. He is the first teacher who treated me as he would treat any other student, the one who encouraged me, guided me, helped me correct my mistakes and most importantly has unwavering faith in me, in all his students and gives plus ultra as both a hero and teacher.\n\u00a0\nShouta clamps down on his jaw, the clogging sensation in his throat getting stronger as he grips the bunch of papers harder.  How long was this essay going to be? \n\u00a0\nI see both Eraserhead in skill and observation and Aizawa sensei in loyalty and love. At USJ as the Nomu slammed his face against the floor but he still used erasure to protect us, the day after the mall incident when Shigaraki had cornered me and sensei said \u201cI\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t there to protect you.\u201d, at the training camp as he gave us permission to fight and decided to deal with the consequences later on, after the Kamino incident as he looked at us with worry which gave way to anger - \u2018they could have died on my watch\u2019, during the Shie Hassaikai Raid as he refused to blink so that I wouldn\u2019t get hurt, as he threw me over his shoulder so we wouldn\u2019t get separated, as he apologized for not being there when it counted even though he\u2019d done everything he could. I look at him and see not just a protective teacher, an alert hero but also a worried father and even though I will never tell him, I am grateful that I will always have a fatherly figure who has my back.\n\u00a0\nShouta hears the voice in his head whisper about how Midoriya\u2019s file lists a name but no contact information for his biological father, of how Yagi is his emergency contact after Midoriya Inko and of how he\u2019s so much as never even heard of Midoriya Hisashi.\n\u00a0\n\n I hope that I can make him proud one day, so that I can give back everything he\u2019s given me and tell the world that I am here because of pro hero Eraserhead, of teacher and father Aizawa Shouta. \n\n\u00a0\nHe blinks up, dazed as he feels someone\u2019s fingers against his cheeks and realizes that Hizashi is kneeling in front of, the tender expression on his face is back and Shouta realizes he\u2019s been crying. He\u2019s crying . His fingers are shaking and he leans into Hizashi, burying his head into his husband\u2019s shoulder.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe thinks of me as a dad Hizashi,  his dad .\u201d he croaks out as Hizashi rubs his back soothingly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd what do you think?\u201d Hizashi asks him gently.\n\u00a0\nWhat does he think? He wants to find Midoriya and hug him, wants to tear down all the kids who had so much as even glared at him because his kid was the strongest, bravest, most empathetic and kindest child he\u2019d ever seen, no bad intentions, only a drive and determination to save people, to help people, to - wait, had he said his kid?\n\u00a0\n\u201cFuck.\u201d Shouta mutters and Hizashi snorts \u201cI thought so.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe is my problem child.\u201d Shouta weakly tries to defend himself, mumbling against the other man\u2019s shoulder.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhatever you say Shoutaaa.\u201d Hizashi sings trying not to laugh.\n\u00a0\nShouta leans back and hands the papers to Nedzu \u201cI still hate you.\u201d he grumbles.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYour welcome Aizawa-kun.\u201d Nedzu laughs.\n\u00a0\nShouta wipes his face, takes the glass of water that Yagi holds out to him and looks at all the teachers, they\u2019re all wearing soft smiles now and he sighs \u201cI need to talk to him, don\u2019t I?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo one is making you do anything.\u201d Nedzu shrugs casually, but the glint in his eyes says otherwise.\n\u00a0\n\u201cRight, I\u2019ll be borrowing Midoriya for a few minutes then.\u201d and turns to look at Yagi pointedly \u201cYou can take the class to ground Beta and by the time they finish changing, I\u2019ll be down.\u201d\n\u00a0\nYagi shoots him a thumbs up \u201cTake all the time you need, I\u2019ve got this.\u201d and when Yagi glances once at Nedzu and mouths \u2018planned ahead \u2019, Shouta resists the urge to throttle the mouse as Nedzu grins at him smugly.\n\u00a0\nAs Shouta walks towards his class with Yagi, he asks \u201cDid Midoriya ever tell you?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAbout the dad thing?\u201d Yagi looks up, blue orbs flickering with amusement.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes.\u201d Shouta replies bluntly.\n\u00a0\nYagi lifts a shoulder and drops it casually \u201cHe mentioned it, told me - begged me not to tell you.\u201d and then he watches Yagi\u2019s eyes become distant as if watching the scene play from memory, smile softening. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to disappoint you and he never believed you\u2019d ever play favourites anyway. I\u2019d say he was also scared of losing whatever he had with you, of losing you in general perhaps.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSilence engulfs them and it\u2019s a while before Shouta speaks \u201cI don\u2019t play favourites, but sometimes people can surprise themselves I guess.  Who knew? \u201d\n\u00a0\nYagi chuckles and then they walk into the class. Yagi instructs them to come down to ground Beta and as Midoriya gets up, Shouta calls out to him \u201cExcept you Midoriya.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMidoriya freezes like a deer caught between headlights and Shouta simply raises an eyebrow in amusement. It\u2019s been a while since he\u2019d seen that expression from Midoriya and he wonders what he should be worried about. A few of his classmates snicker, calling out \u201cOh Mido, what did you do this time?\u201d and a few of them pat him on the back or shoulder, wishing him good luck.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen the class is empty and the door closes behind them, Shouta walks towards a nervous Midoriya and pulls out Bakugo\u2019s chair, placing it next to Midoriya\u2019s.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this about sensei?\u201d Midoriya asks, wringing his hands together.\n\u00a0\nIn typical Shouta fashion, he cuts to the chase. \u201cYou did real good, kid.\u201d he smiles at Midoriya softly.\n\u00a0\nMidoriya stares at him, confusion evident on his face and then things seem to click in place as his eyes widen and he opens his mouth to explain, to say something but nothing comes out.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m already proud of you.\u201d Shouta says, seizing the moment. \u201cBut I do look forward to the hero you\u2019ll become. You have a long way to go, but I know you\u2019ll get there.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe watches as Midoriya\u2019s lips tremble and his eyes glass over \u201cSensei, you can\u2019t just -  that\u2019s not fair .\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYour essay wasn\u2019t fair.\u201d Shouta retorts and then he waits patiently for Midoriya to collect his thoughts.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo you\u2019re not mad?\u201d Midoriya asks in a small voice.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m so mad that I told you I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d Shouta replies wryly.\n\u00a0\nMidoriya\u2019s lips twitch at that, but he doesn\u2019t smile \u201cBut you read the entire thing?\u201d he winces and then repeats \u201cThe entire thing? \u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe entire thing.\u201d Shouta confirms and watches as horror etches on Midoriya\u2019s face and his eyes dart between the door and window.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll use my capture weapon either way.\u201d Shouta points out and Midoriya looks away sheepishly, cheeks colouring red.\n\u00a0\nShouta places a hand on Midoriya\u2019s head, ruffling his hair \u201cThank you problem child.\u201d he says quietly.\n\u00a0\nMidoriya chokes a little and then looks up at him \u201cI should be the one thanking you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nShouta shakes his head \u201cYou do, you show it to me in everything you do.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou -  you noticed? \u201d Midoriya splutters.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAlways.\u201d Shouta whispers as Midoriya barrels into him, making him chuckle.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you had the audacity to smugly call me out in the middle of it though.\u201d Aizawa says wrapping his arm around the green haired boy.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s the truth though, and you know it sensei.\u201d Midoriya responds and Shouta can hear his grin as Shouta huffs in annoyance.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Midoriya blinks up at him innocently \u201cGoing to expel me?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI still can, you cheeky brat.\u201d Shouta bites back.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut you won\u2019t.\u201d Midoriya laughs and it echoes beautifully in the empty classroom.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d Shouta hums, but they both know it\u2019s a lie.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo how much do you think I can get away with right now, on a scale of one to ten?\u201d Midoriya asks nonchalantly.\n\u00a0\nShouta groans \u201cWhat have you done now problem child?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI haven\u2019t done anything!\u201d Midoriya pouts and then he tilts his head to one side innocently and adds \u201cYet.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShouta groans again. He looks tiredly at Midoriya \u201cOne being what and ten being what?\u201d\n\u00a0\nMidoriya looks away, eyes intently tracing the walls like they\u2019ve become the most interesting thing in the world. \u201cOne being I got Kacchan angry again and tenbeingIaccidentallycallyoudad.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAizawa feels laughter bubbling within him as the last part of the sentence sinks in and he hardly contains it as he speaks \u201cYou can get away with the ten anytime actually.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMidoriya\u2019s head whips around to face him, eyes wide in disbelief. Shouta nods once, eyes softening and watches as the watery smile on Midoriya\u2019s face blossoms into a grin- like Shouta had given him the entire world and Shouta\u2019s breath hitches at the purity of it and he thinks 'fuck, he's a goner' because he would give anything to his kid if it made Midoriya smile like that.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThanks, dad.\u201d Midoriya hugs him tightly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnytime Izuku.\u201d Shouta murmurs.\n\u00a0\nAnd if during training Shouta couldn\u2019t stop smiling, his chest filled with warmth, then that was no one\u2019s business but his."
