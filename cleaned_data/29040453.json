    "text": "\u201cBefore you go,\u201d Aizawa says, and his students all look to him with confusion. \u201cI am going to assign each of you a classmate of yours. Tomorrow, you will all do a classwide swap, just like you did a few weeks ago.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Hagakure asks, and Aizawa sighs.\u00a0\n\u201cFor two reasons. First of all, Shinsou has yet to do it, and I want to know where his baseline is for acting. This will also serve as a chance to see how much the rest of you have improved, and if you will be able to fix your mistakes from last time. Any questions?\u201d\n\u201cAre you sure we should be doing this tomorrow?\u201d Iida asks. \u201cLast time, we had an entire weekend to prepare!\u201d\n\u201cMidoriya has consistently done well with less preparation time,\u201d Aizawa states in response. \u201cHe usually does not receive his next assignment until class has been over for hours. You are getting your assignment right now.\u201d\nNo one can really fight that statement, and so they keep silent as they shuffle forwards, each taking their respective paper from their teacher before shuffling out. Midoriya walks up last, looks Aizawa in the eyes, and smiles.\nAnd Aizawa grins back.\nWaiting by the exit, Todoroki looks to Shinsou and whispers, \u201cAnd Midoriya tries to deny the connection.\u201d\nShinsou snorts, disrupting the moment, and Midoriya takes his paper before rushing off, a farewell falling off of his lips as he tugs the two boys after him.\u00a0\nThe day has gone well, and the fun has only just begun.\nWell...fun for some. For those like Midoriya, who is notably calm and carefree as he enters the dorms, confident in his ability to perform tomorrow morning. Others, like Uraraka and Shinsou, clearly have ideas in mind, showing in their wild grins. Then there are those who simply appear content, either because they have hoped for a second chance to redeem themselves, or merely because they are not  opposed  to a new round of swapping, which includes those like Kouda and Ojirou.\nBut for the rest?\nWell, the stress is apparent, the dorms alive with frantic action as the students of 1-A move through the common room, coming in and out with no apparent direction in mind.\nIt\u2019s not until Satou nearly knocks Midoriya straight over that the green-haired boy looks around and asks, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Are you guys okay?\u201d\n\u201cMon ami, do we  look  okay?\u201d Aoyama asks, sparkling angrily as he gestures to the rest of their peers.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d Midoriya blinks slowly. \u201cIs this a trick question?\u201d\nAoyama huffs dramatically, then shakes his head. \u201cTo answer your question, mon copain, we are stressed about tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cTomorrow?\u201d Midoriya asks, and Iida clears his throat.\n\u201cThe personality swap assignment.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Nodding, Midoriya says, \u201cThat makes sense. It can be stressful when you\u2019re first planning, yeah?\u201d\n\u201cEspecially when we have to outdo you,\u201d Kaminari mutters, and Midoriya furrows his eyebrows.\n\u201cAizawa never said that you have to outdo me,\u201d Midoriya notes, and Shinsou snorts.\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t, but that doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t going to try.\u201d Nudging the boy, Shinsou adds, \u201cYou\u2019ve been impressing and terrorizing everyone for a few weeks now, of  course  we\u2019re going to try to match and surpass that level.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the Plus Ultra way!\u201d Ashido chimes in. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know about everyone else, but I\u2019m going to make sure my uniform matches!\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019re a guy,\u201d Midoriya notes automatically, and Ashido pauses.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cIf your uniform has to change, doesn\u2019t that mean you\u2019re a guy?\u201d Tilting his head, Midoriya murmurs, \u201cOr you\u2019re Jirou, as she\u2019s the only one who chose a vest instead of the usual blazer. But you paused like you were surprised, and not perplexed, so you\u2019re most likely a guy. And since I know Aizawa likely assigned-\u201d\n\u201cMidoriya,\u201d Todoroki says, and Midoriya glances up. \u201cYou\u2019re going to reveal who everyone is before we even start.\u201d\n\u201cOh! Sorry, guys! I\u2019m just going to go, ah, figure out my plan for tomorrow!\u201d Just like that, Midoriya races off, leaving the rest of 1-A to watch with shocked expressions.\n\u201cDid...did he really figure out who we all are already?\u201d Hagakure asks, and is met with a series of nods.\n\u201cHe knows too much,\u201d Shinsou mutters. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to outdo him.\u201d\n\u201cNo, we aren\u2019t,\u201d Kaminari says sadly, and then, \u201cbut we sure can try!\u201d\nAnd just like that, chaos resumes.\nDay turns into night, and night turns to day, and so Tuesday shall begin.\n-----\nAnd so Tuesday begins, a little wonky, a little weird, a little unusual in a way that 1-A considers routine, if only to a higher level. And Tuesday begins not with 1-A awaiting Midoriya\u2019s arrival, not like how the past days have started time and time again, but with each student\u2019s arrival being worth noting.\nAnd the first to arrive is Denki Kaminari, twenty-eight minutes before the bell. Externally, the boy is calm and collected, heading to his desk with his head held high and his arms straight. The picture of a perfect student, Kaminari slides into his seat without so much as a sigh, careful to be quiet as he spots Aizawa\u2019s sleeping form.\u00a0\nInternally, however, Kaminari is already stressing out, knowing that he was just a  bit  too late to be up to Iida\u2019s standards. The bar feels much higher than it was, just a couple of weeks before. After losing points for breaking character as Shouji, Kaminari just wants to do well on this assignment so that he doesn\u2019t have to see another \u2018C\u2019 in his future. But Kaminari had wanted to accessorize a little, and  knew  he had some fake glasses laying around his room from a spontaneous purchase that he made a few months ago, and so he had to tear apart his room to find the things.\nAnd he did, making him look quite good, in his own opinion, but it means he didn\u2019t arrive at the perfect \u2018thirty minutes before the bell\u2019 mark that Iida seems to strive for. So Kaminari sits at his desk, a little stressed, a little worried, but sure that he\u2019ll be able to make it through the day without  too  much of an issue.\nHe\u2019s practically a professional, anyways! After all, the boy  is  dressed up for the occasion, with fake prescription glasses resting on his face, and Kaminari has a feeling that he\u2019ll stand out.\nHe is proven wrong immediately, because four minutes later, Yuuga Aoyama walks in.\nAnd he\u2019s wearing a skirt.\u00a0\nAoyama smiles when he sees Kaminari, normal walk gaining a bit of a strut as he moves further into the room, allowing the skirt to sway around him and pulling attention to the kneehigh socks that the blond has donned. \u201cGood morning,\u201d Aoyama greets, his smile a little too coy for the gentle tone that he uses. Clearly eager for the day, Aoyama makes no delay as he perches himself on his seat, clasping his hands on the desk and waiting patiently for the next arrival.\nAnd he does not have to wait long, for Tooru Hagakure walks in four minutes after Aoyama, her invisible form more defined thanks to the pants that she has put on, replacing her usual skirt. If one could see her face, they\u2019d know that Hagakure opened her mouth, ready to greet her friends, before shutting it softly and waving instead. But no one  can  see her face, and so the wave does not appear to be anything but that, a wave, and not a near mistake.\u00a0\nRelieved, Hagakure takes her seat, just as Eijirou Kirishima enters the room. The redhead\u2019s uniform is the same, but his hair is oddly shaped. His usual spikes are missing, instead replaced by ones that stick out at the back of his head, the top simply slicked back, as if he\u2019s trying to imitate a bird\u2019s look.\nKirishima offers a single, solemn nod to his peers, and then takes his seat. The other three look at him, perhaps trying to decide if he is who they assume, only to look at two minutes later.\nBecause Katsuki Bakugou has arrived.\nUnlike the others, Bakugou hasn\u2019t touched his hair. Perhaps because he tuned everyone out the night before, when they sat in the common room and tried coming up with ways to live up to the expectations that came with a second round of assignments- especially after multiple weeks of Midoriya stepping up to the bar and leaping over it without failure-, or perhaps because he simply did not care. Either way, the only notable change for the spiky-haired blond is the properly done tie around his neck, and the way that he seems to...shimmer?\nNo, the four who are already in class are correct, because Bakugou seems to have glitter on him. Not much, just the faintest sprinkling here and there, enough to catch the light and keep attention on him.\nFrom his spot, Aoyama gasps, eyes lighting up as he stares at Bakugou. \u201cMon-\u201d Clearing his throat, Aoyama looks down, then back up. Expression softer, he says, \u201cYou are quite sparkly today. Where did you get the glitter from?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just my natural charm,\u201d Bakugou grits out, teeth clenched and making his smile look far too hostile.\nAoyama looks as if he wants to argue, or perhaps to ask again, but then the time hits sixteen minutes before class, and Kouji Kouda walks into the room. Smiling kindly, the boy takes a seat at his desk, pulling out his notebook and pencils before grabbing one last book and flipping it open. It appears to be one about the history of bread.\nThe other five decide to leave Kouda to his book, instead looking for ways to occupy themselves, or simply watching the other students as they arrive.\nA minute ticks by, and Rikidou Satou walks in, a wide, beaming grin on his face as he enters, easygoing as he takes his seat. Sero walks in right after him, his character immediately given away by the face mask that he\u2019s donned.\u00a0\nOne more minute, and three students enter, all at once. First to be noted is Mezo Shouji, who gives little more than a nod in greeting before sitting at his desk, looking calm and complacent as he goes. Kyouka Jirou is next, and she greets the class with a wide smile and a loud, \u201cMorning, everyone! Who\u2019s ready for the day?\u201d that everyone does their best to respond to in character. The last of the minute is Mina Ashido, who keeps a calm, small smile on her face as she offers a pleasant, \u201cHello.\u201d\nTwo minutes pass, and Momo Yaoyorozu is the next to arrive. She walks in with a pep in her step and a quick, \u201cHi, everybody!\u201d that seems livelier than usual. Her wave is wide and sweeping, a far difference from her normal, polite wave. She makes her way to her desk, movements far more exaggerated than expected as she takes her spot.\nAnother two minutes pass, and then Hitoshi Shinsou is the one to enter the room. He\u2019s scowling, which isn\u2019t  quite  unusual, given the boy\u2019s natural resting face, but it\u2019s deeper and filled with more intent than usual. His tie is missing, forgone completely, and the boy clenches his fists when the others look at him for more than five seconds.\n\u201cThe fuck do you want?\u201d Shinsou snaps, and half of the class hastily looks away, as if on instinct or conditioned, when he flexes his hands.\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought,\u201d Shinsou mutters, and then he storms over to his desk, kicking his feet onto the top with an air of superiority. Fearful of his glare, the students of 1-A are happy enough when Mashirao Ojirou arrives not two minutes later, offering a nonchalant wave before taking his own spot.\nTenya Iida arrives next, when there are only seven minutes before class, looking unhappy with this truth despite the smile plastered on his face. He walks as if he\u2019s trying to be looser, but his gait is too stiff, giving him a loping strut that has heads turning away, in fear of laughing and breaking character.\nIt is much easier, therefore, to look to Fumikage Tokoyami a minute later, when the bird-headed boy walks in with pink dusted on his cheeks, noticeable upon the black feathers. Tokoyami quirks up his beak, smiling as brightly as he can, before letting his expression drop back into its usual one as he takes his spot.\nOchako Uraraka is the next to arrive, with five minutes before the bell. Her outfit is changed, much like many of her peers, with pants replacing her usual skirt and her tie an utter disaster- if it can even be considered a tie, anymore, with how strangled it appears to be. A sunshine-filled smile is on her face, although it\u2019s not fully clear if that\u2019s her own or for her acting.\nTsuyu Asui follows in right after, also wearing pants, and her face is blank until she looks at Uraraka. Then, and only then, does she gain the slightest change in expression, lips quirking up into a gentle grin as she follows the brunette without hesitation.\nThe nineteenth student to enter the room is Shouto Todoroki, who comes into the room three minutes before the bell. His appearance isn\u2019t altered in any way, and all he offers is a simple, \u201cYo,\u201d before turning and making his way to his desk. Confused, and perhaps a little disappointed by the lackluster introduction, everyone keeps their eyes on the door, knowing exactly who the final student is that has yet to arrive.\nFinally, just before the bell rings, it is Izuku Midoriya who enters the room. His tie is well done, but it\u2019s the only thing that seems to be cleaned up compared to his usual, everyday appearance. His hair is even messier than usual, somehow, seeming to stand up on its own, and bags are under his eyes, a testament to a seemingly long night.\n\u2018 I thought Midoriya was prepared for today? \u2019 Most of 1-A thinks, except for the few who understand.\u00a0\nBut most do not understand, and so they wait to see who Midoriya will kick out of their spot. Because  surely  Midoriya will, considering that he did so the last time, right?\nHe does not, instead sighing as he drops into his own desk, slumping in on himself before straightening up, tired eyes blinking at the chalkboard.\nAnd so the day begins, the stage set, the characters out, and the curtains drawn as Aizawa stands up.\n\u2018 Break a leg,  \u2019 Midoriya thinks wryly. \u2018  Let\u2019s just hope it\u2019s not my own. \u2019\n-----\nAnd so the day goes on, full of fulfilled and failed expectations, humor and fear intertwined as the class of 1-A acts as one another. The entrances, once again, left a clear impression on one another, but the day becomes much, much more, and by the end, everyone from 1-A has a favorite part to remember.\nFor Sero, it would have to be Yamada-sensei\u2019s reaction.\nBecause he had expected something else entirely.\n-----\nIt should be known that Hizashi Yamada is not foolish, nor is he oblivious. When he saw the students of 1-A walking out of the school with slips of papers in their hands the day before, he immediately knew what would occur. There had only been one other time that they had exited the building in such a fashion, after all...and that was the Friday before the personality swap that started Midoriya and Aizawa\u2019s reign of chaos.\u00a0\nSo he\u2019s not surprised, come Tuesday, to see his students dressed differently, and acting as one another instead of as themselves.\u00a0\nWhat is surprising, however?\u00a0\nMidoriya.\nBecause Midoriya has surpassed everyone\u2019s expectations every single day, with each and every performance that he offered. Yamada will never forget the first day, when he ended up swearing Aizawa out over the assignment, scared about the swaps, and why the sunshine child was cursing him out. Midoriya has consistently risen above and beyond, surprising and bewildering his teachers and peers.\nToday, though...today, Midoriya just looks tired.\nYamada does not understand it, the way that Midoriya sinks into his chair, eyes drooping as much as he tries to keep them open. And he can see, too, the way that the boy\u2019s peers watch him with a familiar sense of concern. Side glances are sent Midoriya\u2019s ways, gazes that linger for too long, betraying their worries. Very few seem to refrain from sending him these looks, and surprisingly, it\u2019s Todoroki and Shinsou who seem the calmest about Midoriya\u2019s unusual demeanor.\nWhen Yamada ends the day\u2019s lecture, and Midoriya\u2019s only reaction is to set his pencil down and stare blankly at the board, the Voice Hero decides to try getting to the bottom of it. And so the blond excuses himself from the classroom, shutting the door softly behind him.\nOut in the hall, Yamada keeps his voice carefully calm as he dials a familiar number, lifting his phone to his ear and waiting for the device to stop ringing.\nAnd it does, Shouta Aizawa picking up without much hesitation, asking, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cIs the sprout okay?\u201d Yamada asks, and he\u2019s greeted with silence.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Aizawa asks after a moment, and Yamada can\u2019t help but pace as he talks, his free hand fiddling with the headphones resting around his neck for the moment.\n\u201cHe\u2019s really...quiet, today. Tired. He\u2019s got eyebags, which he hasn\u2019t had since he impersonated  you . He\u2019s only, like, half responsive, and looks like he\u2019s going to pass out at any moment. Do you know if he had a nightmare, or something?\u201d\n\u201cWhy would I know that?\u201d Aizawa asks, and Yamada scoffs.\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re basically his dad? Shouta, I\u2019m all for the little listener acting like a mini you and picking up your habits, even if it\u2019s  terrifying  sometimes, but he doesn\u2019t deserve to be so fatigued! Heck, the only one I\u2019ve seen look so tired before is- oh.\u201d\n\u201cYep,\u201d Aizawa mutters, amusement leaking through the phone, and Yamada pouts.\n\u201cHe\u2019s acting,\u201d Yamada realizes. \u201cDamn, he\u2019s good.\u201d\n\u201cYep.\u201d\u00a0\nThe phone hangs up, and Yamada wonders if he should laugh or cry.\nMaybe both? Yeah, both sounds good.\n-----\nLunch is chaotic, as it tends to be. The students of 1-A are \u2018plus ultra\u2019 in many ways, after all, and the student body of Yuuei has learned to give them their space, much like they have learned to give students like Mei Hatsume solitude when she has a manic grin on her face.\nBut when the personality swap assignments started, the chaos of lunch had calmed the slightest bit. With Midoriya, one of the \u2018twin stars\u2019 of 1-A, consistently absent from his group widely known as the Dekusquad, the cafeteria was a smidge quieter, a touch more serene. Still chaotic, of course, because Yuuei doesn\u2019t simply revolve around 1-A, as much as they like to keep tabs on the class, but a bit less...over the top, so to speak.\nBut today is different, because Midoriya isn\u2019t impersonating a teacher. No, he is impersonating one of his peers, which means that he is in the cafeteria.\nAdd in the fact that the  rest  of 1-A is acting?\nWell, it makes sense that lunch is anything but normal.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s odd, too, because it\u2019s clear that even 1-A does not know how to go about their day. Students migrate to their normal tables, only to pause as they realize that their friend groups aren\u2019t the same as the people they are for the day. Sure, the students of 1-A all get along with each other, but some bonds are better than others. And so the rest of Yuuei gets to watch with amusement as the infamous first years slowly find their tables.\nExcept for the few who seem to be confident, who set their stuff down without any doubt, as if there was no reason  to  double check their placements. Students like Kouda, who was assigned someone in his normal friend group, and as such only shifted one spot to the left. Students like Uraraka and Shinsou, who send each other a look before heading to different tables.\nStudents like Midoriya, who moves easily, dropping his tray at his usual table before dropping himself into a seat, offering a single nod to Uraraka, who smiles brightly back.\nBut those are the few, and the rest move with even the slightest hints of hesitation. Aoyama and Yaoyorozu stare at each other for a few moments before slowly moving to Yaoyorozu\u2019s normal table, Bakugou scowls before storming over to Kouda\u2019s table, dragging Kirishima behind him. Sero follows them, smile faltering ever so slightly as he glances around, as if unsure that he\u2019s  actually  following the right people. Whether it\u2019s because he\u2019s not certain who they are impersonating, or whether they are the usual people that his assignment sits with remains unclear, but his wariness is far from hidden.\u00a0\nAshido stands in the middle of the cafeteria for a minute straight before gasping, smiling with delight as she realizes that she, too, can sit at Kouda\u2019s table. For a moment, the girl breaks character, all but running to catch up with her friends- only remembering herself halfway through, where she forces herself to walk with a calmness that she doesn\u2019t quite feel.\u00a0\nMost are able to stay in character, though, as they finally move to their proper places. Ojirou is calm as he sits across from Aoyama, and so is Hagakure when she joins the table that Kouda and the majority of the Bakusquad inhabit. Asui takes a spot next to Uraraka with a small smile, and Iida sits at Shinsou\u2019s table with the most carefree grin that he can offer. Shouji heads to Midoriya\u2019s table as Satou heads to Shinsou\u2019s, and Jirou only pauses for a moment before following Satou.\u00a0\nTokoyami and Kaminari take the final spots at Midoriya\u2019s table, and that is what stops Todoroki in his tracks, the boy having automatically walked in the direction of his usual table. A conflicted expression covers the boy\u2019s face, as minor as the look is, and then the boy sighs and heads to Shinsou\u2019s table instead.\nIn the end, it takes 1-A roughly five minutes for all of their members to sit down, and it\u2019s a surprisingly amusing five minutes. More amusing is how some groups struggle to interact, while others seem to meld together pretty well.\u00a0\nBut not much else happens, and so lunch goes on, only a little more chaotic than usual.\u00a0\n-----\nAfter the oddity that is lunch comes the time for heroics, and the students of 1-A are eager enough to get back into training. Midoriya, too, seems to be eager, the tired slowness of the morning easing away, leaving him more alert. The students of 1-A are grateful, even those who know the truth.\nIt is always odd, after all, to see such an energetic student so  drained .\nToshinori Yagi enters the room, smiling brightly as he does so.\u00a0\n\"Good afternoon, 1-A!\" Yagi greets, voice gentle yet booming as he asks, \"Who's ready for another day of training?\"\nA few whoops and cheers fill the air, along with a sigh of, \" Finally ,\" from Midoriya, earning the boy a few glances. But Midoriya pays them no mind, eyes only trained on the retired hero, and so the looks go away, moving to focus on the blond man.\n\"Today, we will be doing a game of capture the flag! More information will be given upon reaching the training grounds, so let's go!\"\nThe reaction is immediate, twenty students getting up and grabbing their cases- their own cases, for that fact, because everyone is quick to grab their own before Midoriya even reaches the shelves.\u00a0\nNot that Midoriya seems to mind, simply grabbing his normal case before trailing behind the group, gait lanky and easygoing as he follows their lead.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Todoroki says, expression blank as he speaks. \u201cCapture the flag?\u201d\n\u201cIt will most definitely be interesting!\u201d Iida states with an arm chop, and then, more informally, \u201cAnd it sounds fun!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a shame that we\u2019re stuck wearing these costumes,\u201d Kaminari murmurs, pulling on his usual gear. \u201cArmor is more my style, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\u201cAs if,\u201d Bakugou scoffs with a glare. \u201cIf anything,  I  am the one who would look best in armor.\u201d\nAoyama glares at the two blonds, but, wisely, chooses to keep his mouth shut.\u00a0\n\u201cWell, at least I have my costume,\u201d Midoriya drawls. \u201cUnlike you all.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNo you don\u2019t,\u201d Satou points out, and the other boys turn to agree, only to blink in surprise as Midoriya opens his case.\nBecause there\u2019s a basic, dark jumpsuit sitting within the case, just like Shinsou\u2019s.\n\u201cHow?\u201d Shinsou chokes out, and then flips open his own suitcase, only to be filled with another round of confusion.\u00a0\nHis hero costume is  still in the case .\nBut...how? That\u2019s all the boys of 1-A want to know- after all, Shinsou\u2019s costume was made by the support students, a project for them thanks to the boy\u2019s late arrival into the Heroics Course.\nShaking their heads, the boys of 1-A decide that this is a question better left unasked, not wanting to know just how far Midoriya\u2019s ability to act and commitment to his bits is.\u00a0\n\"I'm not giving you my capture weapon,\" Shinsou mutters as he grabs his costume out of its case, and Midoriya grins sharply.\n\"Why would I need an item of yours?\" Midoriya asks, pulling off his uniform shirt and revealing a torso covered in white bandages. One hand grabbing the material, his wrist flicks, and the fabric unwraps, the capture weapon activating and unwinding from his midsection, pooling into his hands. \"I have my own, after all.\"\nThe locker room falls silent, but Midoriya pays it no mind, getting dressed and winding the weapon around his neck before slipping out of the room.\nOnly then does someone speak, and it's Todoroki who breaks the silence.\n\"I think I just short-circuited,\" Todoroki murmurs, and then he, too, disappears.\nThe rest of the boys follow shortly after, and the girls arrive quickly, and so Yagi begins to give out instructions.\n\u201cFor this, we will be following the basic rules of capture the flag. Each team has a flag, which they must plant in their \u2018safe zone\u2019. Your goal is to defend your flag and gather as many others as you can. The game will go on until time runs out, or a team manages to steal all four flags. If you get tapped by someone outside of your safe zone while in their domain, you will be \u2018jailed\u2019 by them until a partner of yours can free you.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if we run into  them , but they don\u2019t touch us?\u201d Midoriya asks, and Yagi hums.\n\u201cThat is allowed! And Quirk use, of course, is also allowed- so long as you do not hurt your peers. Excessive force will get you benched, and a dangerous injury will award the opponent your flag- and cost your grade. Got it?\u201d\nA round of nods prove that the class understands.\n\u201cThere will be four teams of five,\u201d Yagi announces. \u201cYou may make these teams as you wish, but do not fight over it. You have five minutes, go.\u201d\nAs expected, there is immediate chaos. Because for some, there is the struggle of trying to figure out whether or not the teams should focus on the Quirks of the actors, or the people they are pretending to be. Quickly, however, they all remember that the latter is more important for their grade, and race to find their \u2018usual\u2019 teammates.\nAnd so, after a moment of panic, four teams are created. The first consists of Aoyama, Ojirou, Kaminari, Yaoyorozu, and Kirishima. The second group has Bakugou, Hagakure, Kouda, Sero, and Ashido. Then comes the third group, with Shinsou, Iida, Todoroki, Jirou, and Satou. And the fourth team is, of course, Midoriya, Tokoyami, Shouji, Asui, and Uraraka.\u00a0\nThis, of course, means that when the game begins, chaos immediately ensues.\nBecause, as it turns out, it is significantly harder than expected to play a game of capture the flag while trying to act- and perhaps even  fight - like a completely different person. Which leads to some...interesting events.\nWhich occur all at once, causing pure madness.\nThe class, in their defense, manage to last two minutes before everything becomes far too much. Students work together, all four groups do their best to act as a cohesive unit.\nBut then Hagakure picks up a bug, looks at Aoyama, and shouts, \u201cEat bugs, bitch!\u201d\u00a0\nAnd throws the bug right on the blond\u2019s face.\n\u201cChienne!\u201d Aoyama shrieks, activating his naval laser in his panic and blasting himself back to his team, where he knocks right into Yaoyorozu.\u00a0\nTruly, it is no wonder that things begin to go downhill.\u00a0\n\u201cYou can\u2019t call them that!\u201d Jirou shouts as she races over to Aoyama\u2019s group. \u201cThat\u2019s so un manly !\u201d\u00a0\nAs if emphasizing the word, Jirou throws herself forward, headbutting Ojirou in the stomach and causing him to fall down. She then pulls herself up, reaching out for their nearby flag.\nOnly to hear a scream that makes her whip her head around, because the scream came from  her  team.\n\u201cOur flag!\u201d Iida shouts, racing after a Tokoyami who cackles madly, clutching the flag to his chest like it\u2019s his greatest possession.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to do my best!\u201d Tokoyami crows, and Dark Shadow whoops along with him before turning around and sucker punching Iida, knocking the boy over.\n\u201cFuck!\u201d Jirou shouts. \u201cWasn\u2019t Todo- er, fuck,  Kaminari  supposed to be on defense? Where is he?\u201d\nTodoroki is, in fact, in jail, having wandered over to Midoriya\u2019s side to talk with him. He doesn\u2019t seem upset, smiling gently as he talks to Midoriya.\n\u201cI saw this meme online,\u201d Todoroki is saying. \u201cIt was about...roads, I believe?\u201d\n\u201cRoad work ahead?\u201d Midoriya responds, and Todoroki perks up.\n\u201cI sure hope it does.\u201d\nLocking eyes with Todoroki, Midoriya murmurs, \u201cIf any of my opponents arrive, do your best to stop them. Don\u2019t let your teammates- or anyone else- touch you.\u201d\nTodoroki nods, and Midoriya looks away, now grinning wildly as he searches for any approaching targets.\nMeanwhile, Jirou seems to finally understand what went wrong, and sighs as she gets up. \u201cHe\u2019s so lovestruck,\u201d Jirou mutters. \u201cI guess it\u2019s up to  me .\u201d\n\u201cAh, no,\u201d Ojirou says calmly, tapping Jirou on the arm. \u201cYou\u2019re captured.\u201d\n\u201cFuck,\u201d Jirou mutters. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve done this,  bro .\u201d\n\u201cWhat a mad banquet of darkness,\u201d Kirishima agrees with the most stoic expression he can muster, and Jirou struggles to hold back her snort.\nOn the other side of the field, Bakugou screams as Uraraka smacks him, taking away his gravity. Asui works quickly, throwing the boy up into the air with her tongue. The blond tries to shoot himself back down with his explosions- but with his weight decreased, he ends up using  far  too much firepower, sending himself crashing into the earth.\n\u201cSorry,  Aoyama !\u201d Uraraka cries as she darts past Kouda, who yelps and begins to pursue her. \u201cBut I kind of need this!\u201d\nAsui and Uraraka, now equipped with Bakugou\u2019s team\u2019s flag, sprint away from the two defenders, now having to face the rapidly approaching Sero and Ashido.\nOnly for Shouji to appear, lifting Ashido from the ground and throwing her across the field, before doing the same to Uraraka once she passes over Bakugou\u2019s flag, chucking her in the direction of the only remaining team that holds a flag.\u00a0\nWhich is where Shinsou is, the boy racing towards the team. Whether this is to claim their flag, or simply to reclaim his teammate, is unclear, but the purple-haired boy is heading straight for them.\u00a0\nSo when Uraraka lands right in their path, snatching up their flag before sprinting over to an awaiting Dark Shadow, Shinsou is left baffled.\nAnd in a flash, it\u2019s all over. Uraraka lands on the ground, tossing the final flag to Midoriya, who has three others placed gently on their pole. The greenet happily ties the fourth above the rest, dancing around patches of ice that Todoroki had created to defend Midoriya from the other teams, and Yagi calls for the match to end.\nBut before Yagi can speak, there is a scream. One full of rage.\n\"Deku!\" Shinsou shouts, hands curling into fists as he storms over to Uraraka. \"You got in my fucking way! You  planned  that, didn't you?!\"\n\"Kacchan!\" Uraraka cries out. \"I didn't! I-\"\n\"Just shut up, you damned nerd!\" Shinsou interrupts, glaring at the brunette, before shifting his gaze to lock eyes with the fiery blond of 1-A. \"My goddamn  superiority complex  means you're wrong, no matter what, because there's no  way  I could ever make a mistake.\"\n\"What?!\" Bakugou shouts, breaking character to storm at Shinsou, polite expression disappearing in an instant. \"I don't sound like-\"\nHe moves to lunge at the purple-haired boy, only for Midoriya to intervene pressing his hand against the blond's chest.\n\"Hey,\" Midoriya says, and Bakugou scowls.\n\"What the fuck do you want, De-\"\n\"Shut the  fuck  up,\" Midoriya cuts Bakugou off, gaze fierce as he stares the blond down.\u00a0\nAnd Bakugou listens.\nTruthfully, nobody can tell if it's because he's playing along with Midoriya\u2019s acting, or if he did it instinctively, silenced by the force that is Midoriya\u2019s swearing mixed with his determined expression.\u00a0\nIndividually, they assume that it is the latter, because Midoriya is not one to swear with such heat in his tone, such fire in his eyes.\nAnd so no is surprised, not truly, when Bakugou shuts his mouth.\nNor when he backs away, eyes vacant as he goes.\nNo, they just go back to training, and the day goes on.\n-----\nThe day ends yet again, and the students of 1-A seem to let out a collective sigh of relief, happy enough to be themselves once more. They leave the room quickly, exiting as soon as Aizawa hands over their grades for the assignment.\nNow walking back to the dorms, Shinsou admits, \u201cYeah, Uraraka and I figured each other out last night.\u201d\n\u201cHow?\u201d Midoriya asks, and Uraraka snorts.\n\u201cShinsou caught me struggling to try tying my tie like you do. I must have spent twenty minutes just trying to tie it as awfully as you!\u201d\n\u201cUraraka!\u201d Midoriya cries out, but when his friends start laughing, he joins in easily.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m just surprised that it took people so long to figure out that you were impersonating me,\u201d Shinsou admits.\u00a0\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get it until lunch,\u201d Kaminari admits from behind them. \u201cAnd that\u2019s only because I sat with him.\u201d\n\u201cYou probably didn\u2019t hear it,\u201d Jirou adds, just as Iida opens the door for the dorms. \u201cBut when Yamada-sensei went out in the hall, he was calling Aizawa-sensei.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Midoriya asks, and Jirou snorts.\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t realize you were acting,\u201d the girl reveals, and Midoriya blinks in surprise. \u201cHe just thought that you were exhausted, and that you couldn\u2019t be bothered today. I think he would\u2019ve called you back to ask if you were okay if he hadn\u2019t figured it out.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Midoriya says, ever so wisely, and Jirou snorts again.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to ask,\u201d Kirishima calls after Midoriya as the green-haired boy heads into the kitchen, grabbing himself some water. \u201cHow  did  you look so exhausted? Those eyebags are super realistic, dude!\u201d\n\u201cOh! These?\u201d Pointing to his eyebags, Midoriya smiles brightly. \u201cI didn\u2019t sleep!\u201d\n\u201cLike...at all?\u201d Sero asks, and Midoriya nods.\n\u201cYep! I figured the best way to prepare would be to stay up the entire night- it gave me a chance to get ahead in some of my studies, too!\n\u201cThat...probably isn\u2019t healthy,\u201d Asui points out, and Midoriya laughs.\n\u201cProbably not! But I did the same thing for Aizawa-sensei, too! It\u2019s really fun once you\u2019ve got enough caffeine to get through the day!\u201d\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s best if you come sit down,\u201d Uraraka says, and Midoriya agrees easily enough, taking a seat next to Todoroki, who stiffens up in surprise before smiling.\u00a0\nOnce Midoriya gets comfortable, and the rest of the Dekusquad take their own spots on the couches, conversation continues, slipping away from his acting to talk about the others that they had seen.\u00a0\nBut when Aizawa walks into the common room, the students can\u2019t help but look up, curious.\n\u201cAizawa-sensei,\u201d Iida greets, already standing up. \u201cDid you need something?\u201d\n\u201cTwo things,\u201d Aizawa agrees. \u201cFirst, Midoriya.\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d Midoriya perks up, and Aizawa offers a slight smile.\n\u201cJust wanted to let you know that you won\u2019t have an assignment for a few days. Take a break, kid.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYou look ready to pass out,\u201d Shinsou teases, and Midoriya beams.\n\u201cWe match!\u201d The greenet agrees easily, causing Shinsou to snort. \u201cBut what\u2019s the second thing, sensei?\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d Letting out a sigh, Aizawa asks, \u201cWhy is Nemuri asking me for pants and skirts?\u201d\n\u201cOh!\u201d Uraraka exclaims, hopping up. \u201cI\u2019ll go get those! Be right back!\u201d And with that, she dashes off, racing to the elevator.\nAizawa blinks, then looks to Midoriya. \u201cExplain.\u201d\n\u201cKayama-sensei let the girls, and Aoyama, borrow the clothes needed for today\u2019s assignment,\u201d Midoriya explains easily. \u201cIt was likely Yaoyorozu or Hagakure, or maybe Aoyama, who remembered that Kayama-sensei teaches a unit on makeup and disguises, and spread the news so that those who preferred to could change up their uniform.\u201d\n\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you done that?\u201d Aizawa asks. \u201cInstead of buying an entire wardrobe.\u201d\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s simple!\u201d Midoriya laughs. \u201cSensei, she would never have  half  of the stuff I\u2019ve had to wear. I think Kayama-sensei would resign before  ever  keeping a jurtleneck in her classroom.\u201d\n\u201cSay jurtleneck again and I\u2019m disowning you,\u201d Aizawa threatens, and Midoriya nods before freezing, mouth dropping open.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll  what ?!\u201d\nAnd that\u2019s how Tuesday ends, with Midoriya\u2019s friends laughing at his surprised reaction, and plenty of joy to go around.\nYes, the day has been chaotic, but it has been good.\n(And whatever comes next will be much the same\u2026)\n-----\n\n (And somewhere, sometime, later that night, the boy with green hair and a golden heart will receive a message, one that offers a new assignment. One that is for Friday, one that is new and different and intriguing in its own way. And the text will advise Midoriya to bring it up, when he sees the principal tomorrow, for their weekly meeting. To plan, to discuss.) \n\n\n (A text is sent, a message delivered, an eager, albeit surprised, response coming in return.) \n\n\n (A whole new world is opened, and the future will be far more than before.) \n\n\n (As is the nature of a Plus Ultra school, no?) \n\n\n (Oh, how they will weep.) \n"
