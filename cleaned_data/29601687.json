    "text": "Langa gets his first confession a month after he transfers in. Reki watches it from the upper windows with the rest of the audience Langa doesn\u2019t seem to realize he has\u2014the audience Reki would, if he were a better man, warn him about.\u00a0\nHe isn\u2019t a better man.\u00a0\nThe girl\u2019s voice is too soft to hear, but Langa\u2019s carries well against the concrete of their old school building. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Langa tells her. The twist in Reki hadn\u2019t realized his gut was caught up in uncoils, but only for that instant, because Langa follows it with, \u201cI\u2019m seeing someone.\u201d\nThe floor slips out from under Reki like it's on wheels. Someone grabs him by the back of the shirt before he can slip out the window and meet his untimely\u2014timely, actually\u2014demise at Langa\u2019s feet. Someone else leans in close and asks him, \u201cHasegawa has a girlfriend? Did you know?\u201d\nThe hushed whispers filling the room die as the entirety of the class hangs on his answer. He dusts himself off, picks up the part of him that\u2019s still spiraling across the floor, and gives the only one he possibly can:\u00a0\n\u201cYeah. Of course, I knew.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe didn\u2019t, of course. The facts of his life Langa shares are simple and spare and as far between as a summer snow. No; bad metaphor, it never snowed in Okinawa before Langa showed up. Every fact of his life is something Reki has had to beg out of him, and it\u2019s not even that he\u2019s trying to hide anything. It\u2019s not even that Langa is too cool to share. It simply wouldn\u2019t occur to him anyone else wanted to know. A secret girlfriend is so on point for Langa that Reki wonders why he ever assumed otherwise. Won\u2019t hit on girls, won\u2019t go to meetups, won\u2019t talk about girls period, come to that.\u00a0\nReki works up the courage to ask between then and the ride home.\u00a0\n\u201cI saw what happened at lunch,\u201d Reki tells him, and, \u201cSorry,\u201d and hopes his voice sounds as light as he\u2019s trying to force it to be. \u201cWho\u2019s the new girlfriend?\u201d It almost comes out too casual, if that's possible.\nEvidently, yes, by the look Langa gives him. \u201cOh. Her? I don\u2019t remember her name.\u201d\nReki snorts. \u201cMan, that\u2019s brutal. No, I meant, I heard what you told her. You\u2019re seeing someone. Who\u2019s the lucky girl?\u201d\nIt takes all of his mustered courage and a little more to come out with all that in a solid row of coherent words, but of course all it earns him is a roll of Langa\u2019s eyes.\u00a0\n\u201cHaha,\u201d Langa says. \u201cFunny.\u201d\u00a0\nReki throws out his hand without meaning to, more for emphasis than anything else, because Langa still has that dumb-simple look like none of this matters. It connects with Langa's shoulder, a light slap. \u201cNo, I\u2019m serious. Why didn\u2019t you tell me you had someone?\u201d\nLanga pulls up short. \u201cYou\u2019re joking.\u201d\n\u201cNo?\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026 Okay, wait.\" He puts a hand to his head like he's trying to hold it on straight. \"You\u2019re serious? You\u2019re not joking?\u201d\u00a0\nIt\u2019s times like these his Japanese starts to fail him in little ways. The words come out stunted, accented, the syllables drawn out. It would be cute if Reki weren't so\u2014something.\u00a0\n\u201cYes,\" he bites out. \"Why wouldn\u2019t you tell me? That\u2019s kind of a big deal!\u201d He isn\u2019t trying to keep the hurt from his voice anymore.\u00a0\n\u201cI thought,\u201d Langa starts, and stops. He puts his face in his hands, and continues in a muffled voice in no language Reki knows. It makes him mad, and he knows it\u2019s not rational, but he still reaches out and slaps Langa on the shoulder again, lightly.\u00a0\nWith his hurt hand, it occurs to him after, but the pain is a little bit good even as he clutches it to his chest. It\u2019s a part of him that hurts for an actual reason.\n\u201cWe\u2019re friends. You\u2019re supposed to tell me this stuff.\u201d\nLanga\u2019s shoulders jump. \u201cFriends,\u201d he says to his hand. \u201cRight. We are friends.\u201d\nAnd, come on. They are that, at least. Langa has to know that. What else could it be? Work colleagues? Classmates? Or\u2014no, what if Langa thinks he\u2019s some kind of skateboarding instructor? His best friend in seventeen years thinks he\u2019s a skateboarding instructor. Makes sense. Super cool.\nHe sits back on his heels and savors the ache in his hand and makes himself ask, \u201cIs it someone from class?\u201d\nLanga pushes his board back and forth, the little rumble of the tires filling the late afternoon quiet between them as he takes a deep, audible breath, looks directly at Reki, and nods. \u201cYes.\u201d\nAnd that\u2019s a surprise. Reki tries not to let it show. \u201cHave you guys been on any dates?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. I mean, I thought they were dates.\u201d\nThat\u2019s\u2026 kind of sweet. Sweet in the way that feels like it's going to make Reki sick. \u201cHow have you even had time for that?\u201d he mutters. \u201cYou spend all your time with me.\u201d\nLanga gives him a look. Or, gives the wall over Reki's shoulder a look, before he kicks off. \u201cIf you figure out who it is, I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d\u00a0\nHow is that fair? \u201cIs it Chiharu?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cAre you pissed at me?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cAre you lying?\u201d\n\u201c...No.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere are few places to go in the city that Langa won't follow, and right now, Reki needs to put his head on straight, no blue eyes in sight. Luckily, he's been dodging an invite from Miya to crash a local restaurant for weeks. A quick text and he's got someone to distract him from the sad reality he's been dropped into, because even if Miya is annoying, he's at least less annoying than the voice in the back of Reki's mind that's been whispering a thin chorus of what the fuck since Langa left him at his door.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? You look like you busted your nuts on a board,\" Miya says when he walks in.\u00a0\nReki sets his bag down, and his head on the counter. \u201cDon\u2019t. Don\u2019t talk like that. It\u2019s creepy coming from you.\u201d\nIf anything, Miya seems to take it as a compliment. \u201cIs this about Langa?\u201d\n\u201cHow did you know?\u201d\n\u201cWho else?\u201d Miya takes a long lick off his spoon. \u201cWhere is he, anyway? I thought you two were attached at the hip.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Probably with his new girlfriend.\u201d\nIt comes out bitter, but it\u2019s hard to regret it when he gets to watch Miya choke on his cream soda. Really choke, like he\u2019s dying. His spastic coughing catches the eye of the only other customer in the restaurant, and then, naturally, of its owner.\nJoe sticks his head out from the kitchen and Miya waves him over, almost frantic.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat? I\u2019m busy.\u201d\n\u201cReki says Langa got a girlfriend,\u201d Miya gasps out.\u00a0\n\u201cOh.\u201d Joe wipes his hands on his apron and inclines his head to Reki, gives him a quick once-over, like he's seeing him for the first time. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were into that.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2014\u201d Not, he almost says, but runs the words over first and realizes it might be a little much. He and Langa have a social agreement. If Langa wants to\u2014to waste time with some girlfriend, that\u2019s none of Reki\u2019s business. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d\nThey give him the particular look he\u2019s used to getting, if usually from Oka.\u00a0\n\u201cNo, seriously. I\u2019m fine.\u201d\nMiya looks at Joe, Joe looks at Miya, and then Joe walks back into the kitchen. He comes out a moment later with a plate of pasta smothered in cheese, tomato sauce, and what might be basil. It smells like heaven. It smells like it could make Reki forget why he\u2019s sitting here and not on the back of Langa\u2019s scooter heading up the mountain, or out to the beach, or to the skatepark. Anywhere. Anywhere, with Langa, felt like something new.\u00a0\nHis nose feels stuffy all of a sudden. Well, maybe he's allergic to basil.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nReki\u2019s mind is the type that can chew on something for hours and days and still find something new to gnaw on. It\u2019s on the tip of his tongue whenever he shares space with Langa now, and the weird part is that nothing else changes. Langa follows him out of class and up to the roof for lunch the next day like this little revelation meant nothing to him at all and he hasn\u2019t got some secret paramour waiting for him. How secret could it be? Maybe she\u2019s some real babe. Langa could pull that off.\u00a0\nAs soon as they get out and under the sun and in relative private, Langa unbuttons his uniform jacket and stretches out, straight up, all his long lines on display in the shock-bright sun. His stubborn paleness is starting to give way to the edge of a tan. Well, almost. The strip of skin exposed over his abs is still pale as paper, but he\u2019s getting actual muscle now. He always had it, but now it's serious.\nReki peers up at him. \u201cDid you get bigger?\u201d\nLanga stares down at him wide-eyed. His mouth works, but no sound comes out.\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Reki tells him, \u201cYeah you are.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI am?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting taller.\u201d Reki shifts to his feet and gets as close as he can to do a quick and dirty estimation of his height against Langa\u2019s, and yeah, he has gotten bigger. They used to be eye-to-nose, but now it\u2019s more like eye-to-mouth. Reki has a perfect view of his lips and this close he can see the new scar at the edge of his mouth, the result of a particularly bad fall a while back. He let Reki dab antiseptic on it\u2014\u201cIt\u2019s bad.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not, you big baby. It\u2019s just a little blood.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201c \u201cI know. I got it.\u201d\u2014with only minimal complaining.\n\u201cSee? You are taller.\u201d Reki pinches the strip of exposed skin on Langa\u2019s hip. \u201cNice. Must be all the skating. It builds muscles you didn\u2019t even know you had.\u201d\u00a0\nLanga has gone still and silent. His breath is a little off, a little forced. When Reki looks up, his face is blooming with color. \u201cThis heat really gets to you, huh?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Langa murmurs.\u00a0\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to eat up here. You could eat with your girl, you know. I don\u2019t mind.\u201d\nLanga pushes at his shoulder, forcing him back a step. \u201cWho said it was a girl?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not?\u201d\n\u201cIs that an issue?\u201d\nReki waves his bandaged hand. \u201cNo, no. I\u2019m just trying to figure out which guys in our class are dateable. Aside from myself, obviously.\u201d\n\u201cObviously.\u201d\u00a0\nThis is a whole new wrench, a whole new aspect to this thing that Reki has to chew over. The pickings in their class were few and far between before Langa showed up. Even Reki has had his share of love letters and behind-the-school callouts. Okay\u2014one, but that\u2019s a lot! Of all the boys in their class, there might be two that are within Langa\u2019s sphere of hotness. The hair, the height, the allure of his newness, the edginess of his occasional trips to the admin office for skateboard related crimes. It\u2019s a lot to compete with. No, scratch that. No one is on his level. Reki, maybe, barely, and only because he knows that the better half of Langa\u2019s coolness is down to the simple fact no one else has seen him faint at the sight of his own blood or pull his sandwich into pieces before he eats it.\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, look, this is killing me. You\u2019ve gotta give me a hint about who it is at least.\u201d\u00a0\nLanga\u2019s face twists around the frankly obscene bite he\u2019s taken. \u201cMmmm,\u201d he says eloquently and then nods and says what might be an okay. And good. Reki sucks at riddles, but he can make something out of this. He\u2019s known everyone at their high school for years longer than Langa has, and he has a memory for it. Every sordid detail, every time someone fell on their face at a school festival or tried to ditch out on cleaning duty.\nOnce Langa has swallowed, he takes a breath and shuffles over on his butt to sit directly in front of Reki\u2019s lunch, cross-legged. \u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d\n\u201cUm\u2026 What are his best qualities?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s kind. He helps me out, even when I don\u2019t know I need help. He\u2019s patient, and\u2014\u201d\nReki slaps at him. \u201cEnough, enough. My teeth are gonna rot out.\u201d Those are all things Reki could do, if Langa would let him. Nothing special, nothing new. It\u2019s also no clue as to who it could be. \u201cBut what does he look like?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s cheating,\u201d Langa chides, but then gives him a long, hard look, and murmurs, \u201cHe\u2019s as handsome as you are.\u201d\n\u201cOh, cheating! Cheating? That\u2019s cheating!\u201d Reki waves him off and away. \u201cBut seriously. He sounds like a great guy. I\u2019m happy for you.\u201d The words make his lunch burn in his gut. He might be sick. Maybe it was spoiled.\nLanga stands to follow him, gathering his bag and the remnants of his lunch. \u201cYeah. He really is.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn his head, this means he\u2019s going to be spending less time with Langa, but that\u2019s not how it pans out. Or, he tries, he really does, and then one night later Langa texts him after work and asks if he can come over, and what\u2019s a boy to do? Reki is thumbing back a heart and a thumbs up before he can register what he\u2019s doing, purely out of habit. That\u2019s half their text history.\u00a0\nThe evening finds Langa seated between his legs in Reki\u2019s room as Reki cranes his neck to read the magazine Langa\u2019s holding, pointing at various builds and asking all the questions he can. It feels good to be an authority on something, but\u2014 \u201cWe should switch. I can hardly see over your shoulder these days.\u201d\n\u201cHave I gotten that tall, really?\u201d\u00a0\nHe hasn\u2019t, but having all of Langa right there, close and warm, is a little much for Reki\u2019s new-found fragility. \u201cI can be smaller,\u201d he offers, as if that\u2019s a real thing, but then he slides down until his head is resting against Reki\u2019s chest and half-lying on the floor instead of any approximation of sitting. It\u2019s cute.\u00a0\nReki slides his hands into Langa\u2019s hair. Soft, like silk, and always a little cold, like he really is made of snow. \u201cHey, Langa\u2026\u201d\n\u201cMm?\u201d Langa shifts, looks up at Reki through his long lashes, and oh that blue. It can\u2019t be real, but like everything about Langa, it somehow is. The audacity of his existence is wonderful and strange.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t he mind?\u201d\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\u201cYour boyfriend. Doesn\u2019t he mind you being over here all the time?\u201d Never mind that Langa is almost in his lap.\u00a0\nSomething glitters in Langa\u2019s eyes. \u201cI hope not.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWow. Boyfriend of the year. He must be a saint.\u201d\n\u201cSure is.\u201d\u00a0\nIt\u2019s like Reki isn\u2019t even a threat. Like it would never have occurred to Langa he was on the table at all, and man, that bites. Was he never even an option? Did Langa ever look at him that way?\nHis mind stutters to a halt. Did he\u2014does he want Langa to look at him that way?\nLanga\u2019s blue gaze is sharp. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Reki tells him. \u201cJust thinking about your board. I kinda want to try something new with the wheels.\u201d Reki stabs randomly at a blurb in the corner of the page he\u2019d been looking at earlier. Langa is still a slow reader, and, as ever, Langa trusts him. He could be full of shit and Langa would still look at him like his every word were some separate dictate from on high. God of Skateboarding. At least someone thinks he\u2019s cool.\u00a0\n\u201cI trust you,\u201d Langa says. \u201cWhatever you think.\u201d\nMinutes later in their shared quiet, Langa\u2019s breathing evens out, and the magazine tips against his chest. Reki only notices because it jolts him out of his own reverie of staring at Langa\u2019s hands. He should get up, wake Langa, or at least move him where he won\u2019t get sore. The sun is setting outside. He considers it for two seconds and then pulls out his phone to text Langa\u2019s mom. He got the number after the first time this happened, because he might have dragged Langa into S but he\u2019s not about to let it affect his homelife.\u00a0\nLanga is with me. We\u2019re studying late. He sends a thumbs up emoji with it, and then a heart, because the hearts are cute, and it seems like Ms. Hasegawa would appreciate that kind of thing.\u00a0\nThe phone buzzes in his hand a moment later, just as his eyes are drifting shut. Thank you for taking care of him! It comes with a heart, and Reki tries to pretend it doesn\u2019t warm something in him.\u00a0\nAs his eyes slip closed, he wonders if Langa\u2019s boyfriend sends messages like this to Langa\u2019s mom. If they\u2019ve met. If she likes this man more than Reki, and trusts him with all of Langa the way Reki is supposed to.\u00a0\nIt isn\u2019t fair, somehow. It aches worse than any fall he\u2019s taken.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe wakes somewhere around midnight with his arm asleep from the weight of Langa\u2019s head, Langa\u2019s face pressed to his chest in their little heap of shared limbs. The magazine is crushed between them; Reki pulls it free with his good arm and pushes Langa off him. And then his other arm wakes up and decides that he needs to be punished for sleeping on it.\u00a0\nA plate of biscuits is on the floor next to them, with a note in his mom\u2019s familiar scrawl. You two are so cute.\u00a0\nHe glances over at Langa, at the way his mouth opens when he sleeps, at the fall of his hair over his forehead. Yeah, super cute to wake up next to someone else\u2019s boyfriend. Super cute to feel this way about it.\nReki pulls a blanket off his bed and drapes it off Langa before he climbs up and sprawls out on it. His arm hurts. Langa's quiet breaths are too loud. He fists his hand in the part of his hoodie that's still warm from Langa, and winces at the spot of drool on it. Winces, because it isn't that gross.\u00a0\nWinces, because his heart starts going double time, and that\u2014that's gross.\u00a0\nMaybe this isn't going to be as easy as he thought.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe lets the rush of the morning push Langa out of the house before it can get weird. Between his sisters\u2019 endless questions and his mom pushing enough food to feed an Olympic team off on Langa, they don't have time for more than a nod and a few words. After he sends Langa safely on his way, Reki makes a decision.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s enough.\u00a0\nThe thing gnawing at his gut, pulling at the space behind his ribs whenever Langa gets too close\u2014it can\u2019t get bigger than it is. He spends the rest of the day in the garage, working on a new rig, sanding it down to butter smooth and then polishing it to a mirror finish, trying to bat back the annoying voice in his head that can\u2019t wait to show it to Langa. Ugh.\u00a0\nAvoiding Langa isn\u2019t so easy, it turns out. Not in his own head, and not in reality. It should be, but ignoring his texts only makes the ache grow. Even the lame excuse he musters in reply feels like too much. Spend time with your boyfriend, he wants to send instead. Not your skateboard instructor. It only gets worse as the day progresses, and by evening he's weathered a passive aggressive tweet from Miya, and an active aggressive tweet from Shadow, before he concedes that yes, he\u2019ll be at S that night. And no, he isn\u2019t scared.\u00a0\nNot of skating, at least, and not of those two.\u00a0\nWhen he steps out his front door at a half hour 'til, Langa is waiting, and Reki doesn\u2019t have the energy to argue even that. Anyway, only Langa could make a scooter look cool. It's kind of a skill.\nReki slides on the back of the bike and braces himself on the seat. \u201cDid you pack snacks?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cPhone?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cMhmm.\u201d Langa lifts it and waves it around as proof, because the last time he forgot it, Reki had to field a call from his mom and pretend that the sounds of the track were part of a video game. He\u2019s a terrible liar. \u201cI brought you an extra water, too,\u201d Langa says, tossing the bottle over his shoulder. Reki catches it with a quiet thanks and tucks it in his own pack.\u00a0\n\u201cReady,\u201d Reki tells him.\nLanga is still looking at him, brow wrinkled. \u201cWait\u2014\u201c He reaches out and it\u2019s only shock that keeps Reki from jerking back as his headband is tugged at and resettled. Langa picks at his hair a moment and then nods. \u201cOkay. You\u2019re good.\u201d\n\"Thanks.\" It\u2019s already night out, and the gates will be open before too long. Reki keeps checking his phone for the time. \u201cWe might not make it,\u201d he warns.\u00a0\nHis mistake. Langa shifts gears and no\u2014no scooter should be able to go this fast. Reki grips the seat as hard as he can and of course, that\u2019s the moment his arm decides to remind him about its recent trials and tribulations. He can\u2019t stop the sound that falls from his mouth, almost a whimper.\nLanga\u2019s head whips back. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\u201cEyes on the road,\u201d Reki tells him hoarsely. It hurts. He\u2019s an idiot. A day of working in the garage, of sawing and sanding, and he thought he was better. He did, really. \u201cJust my arm.\u201d\n\u201cHold onto me,\u201d Langa orders. When Reki doesn\u2019t immediately comply, he reaches back and grabs at Reki\u2019s hoodie, tugs him until Reki hasn\u2019t got any choice but to press into his back. \u201cHold on,\u201d he says again, but softer, and Reki can feel the words under his hand.\u00a0\nThis close, Langa is warm, and the wind can\u2019t touch him but to tug at his sleeves. He was right; Langa has gotten bigger, and a little stronger. The muscle under his hand jumps as he gives Langa\u2019s abs a friendly squeeze. \u201cDo you take your boyfriend on rides like this?\u201d he can\u2019t help asking. It\u2019s an addiction, at this point, and he might as well admit it to himself, if no one else.\u00a0\nLanga breathes. \u201cYeah. Sometimes\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHaah.\u201d Reki breathes with him, and the scent of whatever soap Langa uses fills his senses. It has a familiar tinge to it, like he\u2019s picked this up from Langa over time without ever noticing. \u201cI bet that\u2019s nice.\u201d\n\u201cIt is.\u201d\n\u201cCan you tell me more about him?\u201d\nIf Langa thinks its weird he won\u2019t stop asking, it doesn\u2019t show. \u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d\n\u201cIs he taller than you?\u201d\n\u201cA little shorter.\u201d\n\u201cCan he skate?\u201d\nThey\u2019re coming up the mountain now. Langa slows as the distant sounds of the crowd start to fill the road. \u201cYeah. He\u2019s incredible.\u201d\nWhere the fuck would Langa even meet another skater? Reki rises off his back but doesn\u2019t let go of his waist, keeping Langa in a death grip. \u201cSeriously?\u201d\n\u201cYep.\u201d\nAnd then they\u2019re there, and it's hard to ask anything over the din. Hard, even, to scream at Langa the way he wants to. They must have met at S, that\u2019s the only explanation\u2014but who from their school goes to S? It\u2019s insanity. He feels like his mind is spiraling away from him again, the way it did that afternoon when he almost fell out the window and literally crashed the girl\u2019s confession.\u00a0\nLanga parks and swings off, grabs his bag in one smooth motion, totally ignoring that Reki is still half-hanging off him. \u201cLanga, wait, you have to tell me who it is.\u201d Langa doesn\u2019t even look at him. \u201cIs he here tonight? Do I know him?\u201d\nApparently ten or twenty questions is over. The look Langa gives him down his nose is the closest to true frustration Reki has ever seen. Even a week of falling on his face didn\u2019t make him look like this. Reki releases him and shrinks back. \u201cSorry. I\u2019ll stop.\u201d\nFor another breath, the tension holds, and then Langa wilts. He shakes his head and murmurs, \u201cYou\u2019re really dense. Come on. Let me look at your arm.\u201d\nThey find their usual place by the rocks; Shadow is already there, trying to pretend he isn\u2019t waiting for them or trying to hang out with them, and Miya is a few steps away, aiming for the same nonchalance. Reki ignores them both and rolls up his sleeve under Langa\u2019s gaze. \u201cI told you it\u2019s fine.\u201c\n\u201cYou always say that.\u201d Langa takes his wrist in hand and checks it over, pressing his fingers in at the joint, and then up, using his thumbs to massage the sore muscle. \u201cDoes this hurt?\u201d\n\u201cNah. I mean, a little. It feels good.\u201d\u00a0\nLanga hums and increases the pressure. Reki sags. He can\u2019t ask Langa to stop, because it\u2019s just the right side of painful, and he can almost feel himself melting, but it\u2019s embarrassing in front of so many people. A glance around, though, and no is watching. No one cares at all. A few looks, but probably only because everyone wants to look at Langa. Even Miya and Shadow don\u2019t seem to think it's anything out of the ordinary, and sure, it wouldn't have been last week, but that was before Reki knew Langa was dating someone.\u00a0\nReki tugs his arm away, a little harder than he means to. \u201cThanks. That\u2019s\u2014that\u2019s fine. You don\u2019t need to do this much for me.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve done a lot for me.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but you don\u2019t owe me. Let\u2019s call it even, okay?\u201d\nNot okay.\u00a0\nLanga\u2019s face is a total blank. Usually, Reki can read something on it. Not this time.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m serious. You should spend time with people you actually care about.\u201d\u00a0\nReki tosses the words into the space between them and then watches them go, like a board down a mountain, riderless, completely out of control. Langa\u2019s face does something odd, something Reki didn\u2019t know it could do as it falls, and his mouth twitches down, and nope. No, he regrets it. All wrong.\u00a0\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Langa says tightly. That one word, and then he\u2019s kicking off on his board, gone, gone, gone.\u00a0\nUsually, Reki loves to watch him ride. It\u2019s art in motion. Not so much this time. As Langa disappears into the crowd, a heavy hand comes down on Reki\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWhat the fuck was that?\u201d\n\u201c...Wish I knew.\u201d\nShadow shakes his head and turns back to his own board, busy fixing something in the setup. \u201cYou riding today?\u201d Reki asks.\nHe nods. \u201cMiya agreed.\u201d\u00a0\nOh, what Reki wouldn\u2019t give to be on the wall for that conversation. \u201cGood luck.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI know.\u201d Shadow might actually be nervous. That\u2019s a first. Reki loves to see it.\u00a0\n\u201cYou know, you and I could have a rematch sometime. I\u2019m still pissed at you for burning my board.\u201d\n\u201cOh, that? Seriously? Wasn\u2019t sending your boyfriend after me enough?\u201d\nHis what.\n\u201cMy what?\u201d\n\u201cLanga,\u201d Shadow enunciates, makes the name into three separate syllables.\u00a0\n\u201cLanga isn\u2019t my boyfriend. Don\u2019t even joke about that.\u201d He\u2019s shocked at the hurt in his voice, at the anger, and evidently Shadow is, too. The look on his painted face is a little comical. Reki meters himself, and forces out the words he has to tell himself. \u201cHe\u2019s, uh. He\u2019s seeing someone else.\u201d\nIt\u2019s tragic news. Now Reki can acknowledge the specific cruelty the universe has perpetrated upon him and him alone. But Shadow has never heard of sympathy, apparently, and what did he expect.\u00a0\n\u201cNo he isn\u2019t,\u201d Shadow says flatly, no inflection, like he\u2019s not teasing and not surprised, but is telling Reki this simple fact about life. \u201cNone of us care. You don\u2019t need to hide it like that. It\u2019s a little sappy, but\u2014\u201c\n\u201cI\u2019m serious! He's seeing someone else! He doesn\u2019t like me like that.\u201d\nShadow bends back to his rig, checking it over. \u201cThat ride? His first ride? He just did that because I said I was going to fuck you up again.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? No. No way, he just wanted to ride.\u201d\n\u201cThe man duct taped his feet to a broken skateboard because he didn\u2019t want you to get any booboos.\u201d He gags.\u00a0\nReki gives him his best, most disgusted look. \u201cThat\u2019s not true. You don\u2019t get him at all.\u201d\n\u201cIt is true.\" Shadow stands and looks down at him. \"You don't understand love. I\u2019m done here. Go ask him, if you don't believe me.\u201d\u00a0\nReki looks at Miya helplessly, but Miya's expression isn't amused. He's looking at Reki like he pities him, and, well, cool. Get in line. \"I'm done here,\" Reki says to them, to himself, to the world at large. He drops his board and kicks off.\n\"Ask him!\" Shadow yells after him. \"Ask him who his boyfriend is while you're at it!\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t because he won\u2019t tell me!\u201d Reki screams over his shoulder. Fuck this day, in its entirety. This week. This month.\n\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re a fucking dumbass!\u201d Shadow screams back.\u00a0\nCool, really cool. And now he can\u2019t stop thinking about it. Even weaving his way through the crowd, all he can see is Langa. Langa skates because he loves it, because he\u2019s incredible at it, because he\u2019s like Reki. Skateboarding is their first love, but the second\u2026\nWas Langa really trying to protect him that day? What kind of idiot would skate S for a guy he met that morning? What does it matter, anyway. It doesn't, if he\u2019s someone else\u2019s boyfriend.\u00a0\nThat sucks. His heart beats out of time. He imagines it the way he hasn\u2019t let himself before: Langa\u2019s head in someone else\u2019s lap, someone else\u2019s hands in his fine, pale hair. Fingers sliding against the gap where his shirt rides up, pushing under the cloth, tracing over all that pale skin, all that new muscle, and oh, no. Oh, no.\nHe shakes himself, and there\u2019s Langa, a few steps ahead. Reki stops, kicks his board into his hand. Langa is bent over his rig, messing with something, right there in the lane. His jeans are a little low, and his shirt is a little high. He\u2019s going to need new clothes if his growth spurt gets any worse.\n\u201cLanga.\u201d\u00a0\nLanga whips his head around, and for a moment he looks at Reki like he always does, but then his face falls back into the placid nothing he only wears, Reki is realizing, when he\u2019s nervous.\u00a0\n\u201cLet me look at that.\u201d Reki holds out his hand as he bends beside Langa and eyes the board he built. A loose screw on the bottom, but too loose, because this board is weird like that\u2014nothing can be as tight as it is on a traditional board, not if Langa wants to fly, and Reki wants him to fly. He pulls out the little kit he keeps in his back pocket and starts fiddling with the hardware, testing it as he goes. This isn\u2019t the place to do it, but Langa isn\u2019t moving, and Reki doesn\u2019t want to, either. Not if it\u2019s going to have Langa walking away from him again with that slouch in his shoulders.\u00a0\n\u201cSorry. About earlier. I guess I just\u2026\u201d Reki starts, but doesn't know how to finish.\nLanga won\u2019t quite meet his eyes.\u00a0\nHe\u2019s gotta ask. For both their sakes, he\u2019s gotta know the answer to the question that\u2019s been stuck in his mind like a splinter from the moment he found out Langa had someone. Or, rather, that Langa had someone, and it wasn\u2019t him.\n\u201cDid I ever have a shot with you?\u201d\u00a0\nNow, Langa is looking at him. Blue, blue eyes. He\u2019s so handsome it makes Reki feel stupid. He trips over his words.\u00a0\n\u201cWould you have ever considered, you know. Dating me. Before.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYes,\u201d Langa breathes, inches away now.\nAnd that question naturally leads into another. The harder one. The one he doesn\u2019t want to ask. \u201cThen, uh. What did I do to mess it up?\u201d\nThey\u2019re breaking up the flow of traffic. Skaters jeer as they pass, but it would take a force of nature to move Reki from that spot as Langa says, \u201cNothing. You didn\u2019t mess up. You could never mess up.\u201d\nThat\u2019s not true, obviously. Something hot is stinging the corners of Reki's eyes. \u201cThen why aren\u2019t you with me?\u201d\n\u201cI am.\u201d\n\u201cNot literally,\u201d Reki begs him, and wants to cry for real. So pathetic. He hates himself a little. No wonder Langa didn\u2019t want him\u2014no wonder Langa won\u2019t even tell him why. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t we dating?\u201d\nLanga reaches out, grabs him by the shoulders, and says, \u201cI thought we were.\u201d And then, to seal the paralysis Reki is experiencing, he moves so close Reki's vision blurs, and there are lips brushing over his.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe jeers around them change in tone. Reki can hear it over even the rush of blood in his ears. \u201cWait,\u201d he whispers, and, \u201cOkay, wait\u2014\u201c\n\u201cI was talking about you,\" Langa says against his mouth. \"I thought you, ugh.\u201d Langa leans back on his heels and puts a hand on his forehead. \u201cI thought you knew, and then I thought you were messing with me, and\u2014fuck.\u201d He curses, and it\u2019s the first time Reki has heard him use the word.\nHe has to run it all back over in his mind. The shock in Langa's eyes, the confusion, the edge of something that might have been hurt\u00a0\n\u201cFuck,\u201d Reki repeats back to him, and, \u201cFuck. I\u2019m so stupid.\u201d\nBut Langa isn't done. \u201cYou send me hearts when we text. You made me a board for nothing. You\u2014\u201c It\u2019s good it\u2019s Langa\u2019s turn for a meltdown, because Reki is starting to see the other side of his, and it\u2019s beautiful. To be a good skater, you have to move fast. To be excellent, you have to know what you want. To be the best, you have to know how to get it. Reki isn\u2019t the best, but he\u2019s getting there. At this, at least, he might have a shot. \"You let me sleep with you. Even my mom thinks\u2014\"\n\u201cLanga.\u201d He can feel himself smiling, and it\u2019s probably horrific. \u201cLan-ga.\u201d\nLanga looks at him, and man, that complexion couldn\u2019t hide a blush even if he did his face like Shadow\u2019s. \u201cDon\u2019t laugh at me,\u201d he says hoarsely.\n\u201cYou think I\u2019m handsome? You think I\u2019m incredible? I\u2019m patient. You think I'm a saint.\u201c Reki smacks a wet kiss, high on his cheek, and Langa makes a sound like a wounded animal. It occurs to him belatedly: \u201cIf we\u2019re dating, why don\u2019t you ever kiss me?\u201d\u00a0\nLanga's gaze jerks to his face. \u201cI thought you were shy,\" he murmurs.\n\u201cI\u2019m not.\" Reki breathes him in, nudges close. \"I\u2019m not shy.\u201d\nLanga shifts, Reki shifts with him, and then the mouth on his is hot and slow and ah, this. This is why he stares at Langa\u2019s mouth so much. It makes sense now. It\u2019s all coming together. Reki bites at his bottom lip and slips his fingers under the gap between Langa\u2019s shirt and waistband, the way he imagined some faceless stranger doing, but it\u2019s better than he thought it would be because it's him, and Langa\u2019s mouth opens under his at even that brush of skin and there\u2019s a hand pushing at his sweatshirt, gripping to find purchase, and another in his hair, pulling at it, and Langa's long legs are bracketing his\u2014he's so hot\u2014\nSomething grabs him by his hood and tugs him up, hard, and then he's rising off Langa, his feet kicking uselessly.\n\"What the fuck are you two doing?\"\nJoe stares at him from inches away, holding him up by the scruff of his hoodie like he weighs nothing. Cherry has his arms folded, two steps behind, and is staring between him and Langa with what could best be described as delicate disdain.\u00a0\n\u201cOn the track? Really?\u201d\u00a0\nThat\u2019s fair. Joe sets him back on his feet and Reki realizes they actually were bottlenecking the racetrack. Embarrassing, right? That\u2019s embarrassing. It should be. He doesn\u2019t feel embarrassed, though, and then Langa steps up next to him and takes his hand loosely, his expression back to the bored implacability he usually reserves for the school's admin office. No apology in it at all.\u00a0\n\"He's my boyfriend,\" Reki tells them stupidly. \"We're dating.\"\n\"Yeah, no shit,\" Joe starts, but then he looks between them, and his brow wrinkles. \u201cWait, you really didn't know? You two were that gross before and you weren\u2019t even fuck\u2014\u201c Cherry slaps a hand over his mouth for him.\u00a0\nAnd, well. That\u2019s fair, too.\n\u201cHow do you know if someone likes you?\u201d Langa asks over the stove, a week after the move is settled and done and the two of them are starting to pick up all the pieces of their new life and set them in place. The question is so far out of left field that she assumes she\u2019s misunderstood for the time it takes her to run the words back over. His Japanese is good, but it doesn\u2019t have the nuance of someone who was raised there yet.\u00a0\n\u201cLikes you?\u201d she asks.\nHe turns, and she hides her wince at the new bruise on his cheek she hadn't noticed when she walked in. That boy. \"Yeah. How do I know if someone likes me?\" he repeats.\nAnd something twists in her chest. This is a problem uniquely Langa, since he hit thirteen and all the baby fat started to go out of his features, and he gained inches on her and everyone else in his class in one summer. He went from friendless to a revolving door of confessions and indifferent dates he hadn\u2019t seemed to quite realize were just that.\nYou don't have to go out with anyone who asks, Oliver told him in the end, and she was glad. He understood Langa in a way she didn't, with all Langa\u2019s little peculiarities, all the little acts he felt obligated to that she never noticed. She\u2019s noticing now, for the first time.\u00a0\nBut then how do I know when to say yes? Langa had asked.\nIf you care about them. Oliver had shot her a look. If you want to spend time with them.\nIf you think they're cute, she\u2019d added. That's why I went out with your Dad.\n\nReally? That was why?\n\nAnd she\u2019d laughed. What else?\n\nGood then. Langa will be fine. He\u2019s got all my good looks.\n\n\nMine, you mean.\n\nAnd that was enough. He didn\u2019t bring home word of anyone new after that\u2014 friend or otherwise. It was bittersweet for a time, and then Oliver got sick, and it wasn\u2019t anything, because everything was the same mess of the three of them, doing their best.\u00a0\nAnd then the two of them, doing what they could.\nShe shakes herself when Langa\u2019s phone dings. He picks it up with the hand not occupied with a spatula and smiles that new smile of his. For a time, she didn\u2019t think he would smile again at all. For a time, she didn\u2019t think she would either, but she feels her lips tug up at the corners. \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d she asks.\u00a0\n\u201cOh\u2026 It\u2019s Reki.\u201d\u00a0\nAnd that\u2019s the first time she hears it, that name. \u201cAre you going out again tonight?\u201d\n\u201cMm, yeah. Is that okay?\u201d\nThey never had a curfew for him. Never needed one. Of course, it\u2019s only now biting her in the ass, but if it keeps him smiling that, it\u2019s worth it. He\u2019s almost too old to listen even if she tried. \u201cOf course, but Langa.\u201d He turns to her. \u201cBe safe.\u201d\n\u201cI will.\u201d\u00a0\nHe\u2019s lying, of course, but it\u2019s a white lie, and one she appreciates. A few bruises won\u2019t kill him. When he sits to eat, he puts his phone on the table beside his plate; it dings again a bite in, and he smiles. From upside-down she can see a heart, a thumbs up, a snowboarder.\u00a0\n\u201c...Did someone ask you out?\u201d she ventures. It\u2019s a safe bet. Reki is the safe bet.\nHis ears tint. \u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cAnd do you like them?\u201d\nHe nods. The blush spreads.\u00a0\n\u201cIs she cute?\u201d\n\u201cHe is.\u201d\u00a0\nOh. They never had this conversation. But somehow, it isn\u2019t unexpected. Something unravels in her at the revelation, as if she knew somehow. Maybe Oliver did. Maybe Langa told him.\u00a0\nHis brow is still furrowed. \u201cBut how do I tell if it\u2019s a date and not hanging out?\u201d\u00a0\nShe sets her meal to the side and thinks of how to put it in terms that will make sense to him. \u201cIt depends on where you\u2019re going. Is it somewhere romantic?\u00a0 The beach at sunset,\u201d she starts listing off, \u201cor maybe a park? Oh! A nice restaurant. Your father loved Italian. Sometimes I think he used date nights as an excuse to get pasta. That man.\u201d She shakes her head and twirls one of the noodles around her chopsticks, the way Oliver taught her to a dozen times with a fork and spoon, as if she hadn\u2019t learned the first time, and needed his hand on hers to remember how. It was sweet.\u00a0\nWhen she looks up, Langa is smiling, and it\u2019s the closest thing to shy she\u2019s seen since she started having to up at him when they talked. \u201cBut we\u2019ve been to those places already.\u201d\nShe chokes on nothing. \u201cCan I see a picture of Reki?\u201d she asks when she can form words again.\nLanga picks his phone up, taps at it for a moment, and then pushes it toward her without hesitation.\u00a0\nThe photo is taken on a roof somewhere in the city, Reki glowing in the sun, skateboard in hand. He\u2019s as bruised as Langa, and his hair is dyed a shade that would look ridiculous on any teenage boy, but somehow doesn't on him. And oh, is he cute, all boyish charm and a smile it looks like he was born wearing.\nShe thumbs over by habit. The next picture is a selfie, not taken by Langa's hand, and probably meant more to be a picture of the board Reki is holding up between them than a selfie at all. The board is blue with a monster painted in white. The part that jumps out is the look Langa is darting, not to the board or the camera but Reki. It\u2019s familiar. It\u2019s a look she saw on his father\u2019s face a thousand times.\u00a0\nThey make a handsome pair. \"Can you send this to me?\" she asks, turning the phone so he can see. He nods.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShe pulls it up later in her room in the quiet alone and looks, and thinks of Oliver, and tries not to cry.\u00a0\nIt doesn\u2019t work, but for once, the tears aren\u2019t all sad. This was never the plan. The trajectory of their lives was never this. Moving countries, finding a new job, dragging Langa with her, restarting both their lives from square one. She's had time to regret the decision, but the Langa in the photo looks relaxed the way he rarely did anywhere but on the slope back home, and happy the way he never was around anyone but them.\nNow the only real regret in her is that she's the only one there to see it.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt isn\u2019t all perfect. Langa\u2019s performance in school tanks. They have a serious talk about it; he swears he\u2019ll do better; she settles for him passing. He\u2019s almost never home at night, and in the morning, he\u2019s always beat up and raccoon-eyed over the breakfast table. She wonders what it says about her that she doesn\u2019t quite have it in her to be scared or mad about any of it. The board he carries around with him has twice as many scrapes, but when she asks him about it, he holds it that bit closer and tells her Reki made it for him.\u00a0\nOnce, she calls. Curiosity gets the better of her, so she conjures up some question about breakfast and dials his number while he\u2019s out past midnight. It goes through, which is a surprise, and then someone with a voice nothing like Langa\u2019s answers it, and that\u2019s another.\u00a0\n\u201cHi, Langa\u2019s mom!\u201d the voice says brightly. She gives herself three guesses as to who it is and the first two don\u2019t count. The sound in the background is deafening\u2014cheering, screaming, what might be airhorns\u2014the sound muffles and Reki says, \u201cSorry, we\u2019re uh. Watching a loud movie. Langa is in the bathroom.\u201d\nIt\u2019s such a bad lie she has to cover her mouth to keep from laughing. She really has gone nuts. What would Oliver say? \u201cIs this Reki?\u201d she asks, only to be sure.\u00a0\n\u201cYes!\u201d he says, and, \u201cWait\u2014Langa told you about me?\u201d\nIt\u2019s hard to tell through the static fuzz of background noise, and his voice is a little rough anyway, but she imagines he sounds surprised, and well. It\u2019s not as if Langa is gushing with emotion. There are a dozen things she wants to tell him, but she settles for a light, \u201cOnce or twice,\u201d she says, and that isn\u2019t technically a lie, but it is a stretch of the truth if the friend Langa talks about at every meal is anyone but him.\u00a0\n\u201cDid you need me to tell him anything?\u201d\nShe contemplates it, and then decides on a light, \u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d And then, because she can, adds lightly, \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s troublesome, but watch\u00a0 out for him for me, will you?\u201d\nHe\u2019s quiet a moment, and then he says with all the conviction of the young, \u201cOf course. I won\u2019t let anything happen to him.\u201d\u00a0\nIt\u2019s as good as she\u2019s going to get out of either of them, and a little better than she was looking for, honestly.\u00a0\nIt occurs to her after to send Langa a quick text. Tell Reki to send me his number. And he does, and Reki does, and that\u2019s something.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA month later they go on an overnight trip, the two of them. A real vacation to a beach with their pooled work money and a little extra she throws in because they aren\u2019t flush but they aren\u2019t doing so poorly that she wouldn\u2019t move the moon and stars to keep the excitement in Langa\u2019s voice at the prospect. It\u2019s a healing vacation, Reki tells her, verbatim. Something about his arm and at least they\u2019re trying to be discreet.\u00a0\nLanga comes back two days later with a sunburn, a bag of souvenirs, and a grin. It looks good on him, and she realizes he\u2019s crossed over some line she missed; he hasn\u2019t been a child in a long time, but he was always closer to her and Oliver than he was to anyone else. She isn\u2019t sure that\u2019s true anymore. It\u2019s a revelation both bitter and saccharine-sweet, and then she opens the bag he gives her. Pilfered shells, a box of shortbreads stamped into wave shapes, assorted cakes; all the odds and ends she missed about home when she lived in Canada, all the things Oliver and him used to treat her to on the rare times they could take a family vacation. Maybe, no matter how old he is, he\u2019ll always be young to her.\u00a0\nShe has that thought, and then sees a different color under the line of sunburn on his neck.\u00a0\n\u201cLanga\u2014what is that?\u201d She points to the dark little bruise, though she knows what it is, what it has to be.\u00a0\nHe frowns, reaches up to pull at his collar. \u201cOh. I think Reki did that. We were messing around.\u201d He uses the English word for it, and she wants to put her face in her hands. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s a surprise, at least.\nShe musters a little courage. \u201cAre you two sleeping together?\u201d\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d he says with indifference and not an ounce of hesitation.\nThis boy. She prays Oliver had this talk with him at some point. They mentioned it; he said he would, and Langa has to know\u2014about all that. He\u2019s almost eighteen. He has to know. \u201cYou\u2019re using protection, at least, I hope.\u201d\nHe frowns at her. \u201cNot really. The helmet makes it hard to see and knee pads throw my balance off.\u201d\nShe really does put her face in her hands then. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t mean\u2026\u201d\u00a0\nShe eyes the picture on the shelf of the three of them, and the new one beside it, the one she added, of her son and Reki. Oliver would love this. Every moment of it.\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, Langa,\u201d she decides. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re happy,\u201d\n\u201cI am.\u201d His phone dings. He smiles. She believes him.\u00a0"
