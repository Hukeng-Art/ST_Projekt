    "text": "Zuko is not okay.\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s given up on even trying. He submits to the medic\u2019s flustering over changing his bandages twice a day and applying a healing salve to try and save his eye. He does as Uncle bids and  takes it easy , whatever that means. Being boring is what taking it easy means and Zuko doesn\u2019t even care. He sleeps. Well, kind of. He lays in bed on his back and stares at the ceiling until tears start slipping from his good eye and then he has to find a dark place on the ship to hide for a few hours until he can breathe again or the sun comes up, whichever comes first.\n\u00a0\nAnd he meditates.\n\u00a0\nHe meditates  badly. \n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s the\u2014- used to be, the prince of the Fire Nation, he grew up meditating with a candle even before he ever bent flame. There\u2019s absolutely no reason for the flickering flames to make his heart race and stutter, and then he can\u2019t tell whether he\u2019s actually feeling pain on the side of his face or he\u2019s just remembering.\n\u00a0\nDao\u2019s salves are borderline legendary but they only do so much.\n\u00a0\nAzula would laugh herself sick if she knew that Zuko had managed the impossible: a firebender afraid of flames.\n\u00a0\nHe sets his jaw and glares at the row of candles in front of him.\n\u00a0\nThe ship is metal and full of firebenders\u2014 if anything happened, someone would be able to take care of it, he knows.  Uncle  would take care of it. But anyone knowing about this makes him want to throw himself over the side of the Wani, and Zuko\u2019s horribly grateful that he\u2019s still too injured to be cleared for practice. How\u2019s he ever going to be able to bend again if he\u2019s going to be a scared little baby?\n\u00a0\nHow\u2019s he going to capture the Avatar if he doesn\u2019t have the one thing he\u2019s kind of got going for him?\n\u00a0\nHow\u2019s he gonna be able to get Father to forgive him if seeing the flickering candlelight match his breath is enough to make him freeze up like a kangaroo-deer in the light of a lantern?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nZuko can\u2019t see a way out of this.\n\u00a0\nHe can barely fucking see.\n\u00a0\nHe jumps when he feels something nudge his hand, and Zuko cracks open his good eye to see Suzu, the ship\u2019s newly procured rat-catching pygmy-puma, staring at him. He shakes his head at her.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGo away,\u201d he grumbles. She\u2019s had kittens recently and none of them have been able to find where she\u2019s stowed them. The crew\u2019s already been taking bets on who\u2019s going to see the first one.\n\u00a0\nShe meows at him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGo away!\u201d This time Zuko shouts and the candle\u2019s flames shoot upwards and without warning, his body tenses and he flinches, hard, and snuffs the flames with a cut of his hand. Suzu runs with a high pitched meow, frightened and fluffed up, and Zuko slumps over to press his forehead into the metal floor. \u201cDamnit. Damnit!\u201d\n\u00a0\nThere are only two on this ship who even kind of like him, and Zuko\u2019s just run off half of them.\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s mad, then, furious, and then all the rage drains out to leave him feeling empty and cold and shivering on the floor of his quarters.\n\u00a0\nHe can\u2019t breathe.\n\u00a0\nZuko doesn\u2019t know how long he stays there shaking.\n\u00a0\nThere\u2019s a knock on his door and Zuko groans.\n\u00a0\n\u201c What ?\u201d He means to snap but it comes out weakly, and Uncle pokes his head in. There\u2019re wrinkles in his forehead and he doesn\u2019t look happy, standing there and watching him. Zuko\u2019s stomach twists.\n\u00a0\nHe could be home right now, if it wasn\u2019t for him.\n\u00a0\nIt wasn\u2019t bad enough that Zuko had to ruin his own life, he had to take Uncle down with him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you alright, Prince Zuko?\u201d\n\u00a0\nUncle knows damn well that he\u2019s not alright, and steps through the threshold and approaches. He kneels down next to Zuko and squeezes his shoulder, and Zuko\u2019s so  tired  that he can\u2019t even fight it. He shuts his eye,  hard, and curls in on himself.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, nephew.\u201d Uncle\u2019s voice is so damn sad. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI scared Suzu,\u201d Zuko whispers into the floor and wishes he could sink into it, through the ship, and all the way down to the bottom of the sea. \u201cI was trying to meditate and I can\u2019t do it, and then I yelled at her and she  ran away .\u201d To his shame, he can feel telltale heat building up behind his eyes and he clenches them tighter. \u201cShe hates me.\u201d\n\u00a0\nUncle Iroh holds his shoulders in his hands and works Zuko up off of the floor until he\u2019s sitting up against the side of his bed.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cTell me what the problem is.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWhere isn\u2019t the problem? Zuko\u2019s entire existence is a fucking problem.\n\u00a0\nThe words are there but they won\u2019t come out. Uncle sits in front of him on his haunches as if he can sense them, and waits patiently. How long is he gonna wait?\n\u00a0\n\u201c...I don\u2019t think I can bend anymore.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEventually he chokes the words out and they sound even stupider coming out of his mouth than they did in his head. Uncle tilts his head.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy would you think that?\u201d He asks. Zuko turns his face away and thinks the shame is going to eat him alive.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid.\u201d He whispers. \u201cFire used to feel\u2026\u201d Not safe, because no flame is a safe one. But it used to feel comfortable and now all he can feel is pain. \u201cGood.\u201d Fire used to feel good, and now it doesn\u2019t. It used to feel like a part of him and now it doesn\u2019t.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nZuko is the worst.\n\u00a0\nUncle\u2019s face falls and Zuko feels even worse. He\u2019s disappointed him. It\u2019s not a surprise, he thinks. He\u2019s always been kind of a disappointment.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh,  Zuko ,\u201d he breathes, and that\u2019s not disappointment in his voice but definitely pain. \u201cOf course you would feel that way.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAzula wouldn\u2019t.\n\u00a0\nUncle looks at the candles, frowns, and turns away from them.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThose won\u2019t do you much good until you feel more confident in your breath,\u201d he says, which is a way nicer way to say \u2018til you quit being a scaredy cat baby\u2019 than Zuko would have. \u201cI have a better idea.\u201d Uncle settles himself more comfortably on the floor and spreads his hands in front of him. A tiny flame blooms in the middle of them.\n\u00a0\nZuko goes very still.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPerhaps you will feel safer if you meditate on my fire. We\u2019ll do it together. This is  my  fire\u201d Uncle gives an exaggerated breath and the fire in his hands grows, then shrinks on his next inhale, \u201cAnd I will  not  use it to hurt you.\u201d And Zuko believes him.\n\u00a0\nHe should feel embarrassed at the way Uncle\u00a0 Iroh leans back and makes a show of closing his eyes, his hands loose and relaxed in front of him. Zuko watches his flame grow and shrink, grow and shrink, and matches his breath until they\u2019re breathing in sync and he feels less like he\u2019s going to crawl out of his skin. It\u2019s never out of Uncle\u2019s control and eventually Zuko allows his eye to close, trusting that he wouldn\u2019t allow it to get away from him.\n\u00a0\nHe startles when there\u2019s a nudge at his hand, and Zuko peeks his eye open to see Suzu standing near him. Her green eyes are so big but she doesn\u2019t look scared. Uncle\u2019s eyes are still stubbornly shut but there\u2019s a tiny smile tilting his lips up. Zuko reaches out and rubs behind her ears.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I yelled at you,\u201d he mumbles to her, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d\n\u00a0\nShe chirps at him and then flounces out of the room, and Zuko gets back to his business of trying not to be terrified out of his mind...and then there\u2019s something bigger and more solid than a little wet nose in his palm.\n\u00a0\nZuko looks down just in time to see Suzu plop down something tiny and furry and spotted into his hand. Her kitten is so, so little but it\u2019s eyes are open and blue like babies\u2019 always are, and its tiny paws make little biscuits in his palm. Zuko gives up on meditating entirely and Uncle quits pretending he\u2019s not paying attention, because that\u2019s about the cutest thing that either of them have ever seen.\n\u00a0\n\u201c....I think you win the pot, Prince Zuko.\u201d\n\u00a0\nZuko has no idea how much is in the pot but he\u2019s sure it doesn\u2019t compare to what he feels right now. His heart twists and he knows that even if the Avatar suddenly appeared in front of him right this minute, he wouldn\u2019t be able to move out of this very spot.\n\u00a0\nSuzu looks pleased with herself and nudges his leg with her foot. She leaves again and returns with another kitten, a little black one this time to go with the calico, and that one too she brings to him. She does it one more time and then puts herself full in Zuko\u2019s lap.\n\u00a0\nZuko stares down the little pile of cats in his lap and tries to remember how to breathe.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy did she bring them to me?\u201d He asks eventually.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnimals can sense a good heart,\u201d Uncle tells him firmly, \u201cand yours is very kind and very gentle. Suzu knows that her kittens will be safe with you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t  want  a kind heart,\u201d he mumbles contrarily, \u201cI  want  to go home.\u201d He doesn\u2019t mean for the words to ring so true but they do, and both Uncle\u2019s silence and the red that starts to rim his eyes is telling. \u201cUncle, I want to  go home .\u201d\n\u00a0\nZuko doesn\u2019t remember the last time he was held (or the last time that somebody wanted to hold him) but suddenly Uncle Iroh\u2019s very, very close and wrapping his arms around him and pulling him to his chest. He\u2019s careful not to smush any of Zuko\u2019s company and it should feel caging but Zuko feels safe for the first time in what feels like forever, really safe, and if he cries, no one\u2019s going to say anything.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAang wouldn\u2019t have known if not for the blueberries, and if not for the blueberries, he wouldn\u2019t have kept watching.\n\u00a0\nThe bulk of Appa\u2019s diet needs to be grass and leaves and roughage, like hay, for him to stay healthy, but fresh produce is a welcome treat that both a bison and his boy can enjoy, despite how Sokka complains that too many vegetables would sap away his manliness like a rainstorm to a fire. Nevertheless, Aang tries to keep something fresh on hand for snacks and trying times, and he still laughs a little to himself at the momentary pause in Katara\u2019s face when he offers her a slice of apple, because  she  still hasn\u2019t gotten used to having accessible fresh food that hasn\u2019t been preserved for months beforehand in salt and oil.\n\u00a0\nThings have been weird since Zuko decided to teach him firebending. Of course it\u2019s a little hard to trust him after all they\u2019ve been through, but Aang wants to be able to rely on him and thinks that he can. Zuko\u2019s a lot of things but he\u2019s kind of a bad liar, whether that\u2019s when he\u2019s trying to lie about being a good guy or lying about being a bad one. Aang doesn\u2019t need Toph\u2019s lie detecting to know that Zuko is here wholeheartedly and not just because he doesn\u2019t have another choice. They haven\u2019t talked about it, because Zuko can also be relied upon to be testy and prickly at the best of times and Aang doesn\u2019t want to push his luck  that  much, but they know enough to know that Zuko had the opportunity to have everything he always said he wanted fall into his lap, and he said no.\n\u00a0\nYou don\u2019t throw everything away for nothing, and maybe Katara\u2019s right and Aang\u2019s trust is misplaced, but he thinks that Zuko\u2019s here for the long haul.\n\u00a0\nBut, anyway.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBlueberries.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s just after breakfast that Aang approaches Appa with a handful of blueberries, and Appa snuffles at his hand with gusto...and then turns away as if disappointed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat the\u2026?\u201d Aang mumbles and stares at his bison. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, buddy? Are you sick?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe doesn\u2019t look sick; his color\u2019s fine and his eyes are bright and his tongue is its normal pink, but Appa\u2019s never turned down a snack in his life. Aang eyes him with concern and offers the blueberries again. This time they get eaten but slowly, like Appa\u2019s doing him a favor.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd Aang forgets about it for a few hours, until he\u2019s done with earthbending with Toph and drags his aching bones back to camp\u2026\n\u00a0\nAnd then stops.\n\u00a0\nZuko\u2019s sitting near Appa. That\u2019s not unusual, Aang realizes, he does that a lot actually, but then Appa turns his head and nudges the span of Zuko\u2019s broad shoulders insistently, like a demand. Aang\u2019s first instinct is to reveal himself and stop whatever irritated reaction might come from Zuko because he doesn\u2019t like being messed with, and then he squashes that instinct down because Zuko\u2019s entire face just  softens  like Aang\u2019s never seen it before. He didn\u2019t even think that Zuko could even make a face like that. Even the side with the scar looks less angry, and it doesn\u2019t look out of place that Zuko reaches out and gives Appa a scratch on the head, telling him to  just wait a minute, hold on, be patient .\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs if Zuko\u2019s ever been patient before in his life.\n\u00a0\nBut that\u2019s not really true either, Aang amends. He\u2019s not as easygoing of a teacher as Katara but he\u2019s more patient than he could be in the wake of teaching firebending. Aang can\u2019t help it, there\u2019s still something really scary about fire that he hasn\u2019t managed to shake and he\u2019s sure that Zuko knows it. He\u2019s not an easy teacher, but he tries to be a fair one.\n\u00a0\nZuko gets to his feet and goes to his bag, set away from the rest of their stuff like it\u2019s a metaphor for his tenuous place in their group, and rummages through it. Appa gets even more excited and even stomps his feet a little when the banished prince pulls out a bright, fresh orange, slips a knife out of nowhere and cuts it into sections as he walks back to the bison. He nibbles on a segment himself and offers another to Appa, who takes it with  way  more than enthusiasm than he did with Aang\u2019s blueberries.\n\u00a0\nAang nearly gives himself away with an unintentional snort of laughter that could ruin everything. It\u2019s a relief to know that Appa\u2019s not sick, just spoiled. Nobody on the planet would ever believe who\u2019s doing the spoiling, though, and Aang plans on keeping that to himself as best he can for as long as he can. There\u2019s little enough peace in the world as a whole and you\u2019d have to be stupid not to know just how little real pleasure there is in Zuko\u2019s life.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAang will let him keep it.\n\u00a0\n\u2014-\n\u00a0\nAfter that, though, he finds himself watching more. It never seemed off that Zuko would keep himself away from everyone else, seemed normal for the circumstances, but the more Aang watches the more he realizes that Zuko isn\u2019t the only one doing it. He doesn\u2019t try overly hard to insert himself into their interactions but it\u2019s not like they ever really invite him in, either.\n\u00a0\nKatara\u2019s outright hostile, despite the undeniable difference in the Zuko they have now and the one they thought they knew before, Sokka\u2019s indifferent except for when it comes to who\u2019s in charge of making dinner that night, and Toph...well, Toph\u2019s the exception to everyone else.\n\u00a0\nToph\u2019s the only one who didn\u2019t really have a bad experience with Zuko before getting to know him, and it shows in all her interactions with him. She bosses him mercilessly and Zuko just...takes it? He grumbles and mutters unflattering things under his breath but whatever she bids him, he does, and now that he thinks about it Aang realizes that he  has  seen that very soft expression before, just to a lesser extent, because it shows up when Zuko looks at Toph sometimes too.\n\u00a0\nAnd then he remembers that Zuko\u2019s got a little sister. A crazy little sister, but that doesn\u2019t change that he\u2019s a big brother just like Sokka, and maybe he kind of likes being bossed around without the threat of murder behind it.\n\u00a0\nOr maybe Zuko\u2019s just given up entirely, Aang\u2019s not totally sure.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not like he doesn\u2019t pull his weight, either. He does his share of the cooking (maybe more than his share, because no one wants to rely on Sokka or Toph for food at the risk of dying)\u00a0 and cleaning, he packs his own things neatly, he trains Aang in firebending and he never, ever loses control of his flames the way he did that one disastrous time that ended in Toph\u2019s burnt feet. He brushes Appa even though even Aang doesn\u2019t even like doing a full brush because the fur blowback is  unreal , and just generally makes himself pretty easy to forget about.\n\u00a0\nBeing willing to brush Appa should have been a dang hint?\n\u00a0\nBut Aang can\u2019t forget about him now. He didn\u2019t even want to in the first place! It just kind of...happened? It was easy, he eventually admits to himself as he chews on a bite of vegetable stew, because in truth, Aang had never really thought that Zuko was that bad of a guy. Not a  nice  guy and definitely a dangerous one, but he couldn\u2019t be put to the same level as Zhao had been, or Azula, or...or lots of people. So it had been easy to let him in when they\u2019d needed something from him, because they needed him and he was there and convenient and was willing to be forgettable?\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s an uncomfortable thought and Aang is not cool with it, and he tells himself that he\u2019s going to stop forgetting about Zuko because he goes out of his way to make it easy to do. It\u2019s not fair and it\u2019s not right, and when it comes down to it, Aang actually  likes  him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo he\u2019s going to watch out for him\u2014 not for him to turn around and do something diabolical like Katara swears he\u2019s gonna, but watch out for him in general, and maybe if Aang does better at this whole Avatar thing, they can maybe be  real  friends the way he wants to be.\n\u00a0\n\u2014-\n\u00a0\nIt takes Aang a decent amount of time to fall into a deep sleep\u2014 it comes with the whole airbending, being able to feel every dang breeze thing, so before that happens, everything wakes him up. He\u2019s been sleeping really well lately but that evening, he jerks awake with a start because  there\u2019s a noise . A shuffling sound and a muffled swear like somebody kicked a rock, and Aang tries to figure out without waking up too much what\u2019s going on. Katara\u2019s out, Toph sleeps like a dead man, and Sokka\u2019s right next to Aang, passed out. So it\u2019s gotta be Zuko.\n\u00a0\nTrying not to move too much, Aang tries his best to do a sleeping flop over to his other side, cracking an eye open just enough to see into the night.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe fire\u2019s burnt down to embers, but Aang knows it can be started back up or extinguished entirely if need be, and that little bit of light lets him see Zuko stagger in from wherever he\u2019s been sleeping (not with the rest of them, who sleep close to each other for warmth and camaraderie and safety, never ever too close to them). He looks  awful  in a way he never looks during the daytime. Exhausted and worn out and...sad. He looks really upset, and Aang almost sits up and tries to comfort him, but stops at the last second.\n\u00a0\nNot just because he\u2019s curious, but because he\u2019s sure that it might make Zuko sadder.\n\u00a0\nSo he stays still and watches the firebender walk past them to where Appa sleeps, looking almost like a boulder himself and snoring in the evening quiet.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHi, Appa,\u201d Zuko whisper mumbles and doesn\u2019t so much sit down as he drops to the ground and leans back, almost disappearing into Appa\u2019s white fur and curling up to make himself look smaller. He does that sometimes too, especially at night before they all start turning in for bed. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s fine,\u201d he says when Appa twitches and peeks an eye open and starts to make a rumble at him, \u201cI\u2019m okay. I\u2019m okay.\u201d\n\u00a0\nZuko is not okay.\n\u00a0\nIt takes him  forever  to fall asleep and Aang knows this because he can\u2019t even think of passing out at least until Zuko does, but when he wakes it\u2019s just before sunrise and he\u2019s the first one up. Firebenders rise with the sun, he remembers, but sometimes Zuko\u2019s been up before then, too.\n\u00a0\nSometimes, it\u2019s like he never went to bed in the first place.\n\u00a0\nAang has every intention of going back to sleep and getting the last bits he can before a sunrise meditation, but before he does, he can\u2019t help taking a long, full look at the scene he pretended not to see last night.\n\u00a0\nZuko\u2019s there still, fully curled into Appa\u2019s side, but even when he sleeps he looks ready to defend himself. Appa doesn\u2019t look worried about it, though, and Aang wonders how many times it\u2019s happened before, how many times they all slept through it. He looks at the dark smudge of sleep deprivation under Zuko\u2019s good eye, and the way he doesn\u2019t sprawl like a prince should but holds himself tense and small and wary.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDoes he always do that, or is it a new thing?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDid he always do that, or did somebody do it to him?\n\u00a0\nAang wants to know and doesn\u2019t, because you can\u2019t take something like that back once it\u2019s out in the universe.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAppa\u2019s asleep and Aang doesn\u2019t want to wake him, but he can\u2019t resist a whispered, \u201cThanks, buddy,\u201d in his direction.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAang can\u2019t help paying attention, now, and he\u2019s determined to do better. He\u2019s going to do better, for everybody\u2019s sake.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKatara\u2019s just waiting for Zuko to fuck up.\n\u00a0\nShe doesn\u2019t trust him as far as she can throw him, and she never will because she trusted him before and look at where that got her? Second chances can pay off sometimes but third chances are for people who don\u2019t mind freezing to death, and Katara\u2019s come too far for that.\n\u00a0\nShe\u2019s been outvoted, though, and Aang  does  need a teacher. Katara would have chosen anyone else. Literally anyone else short of his crazy sister or the Fire Lord himself, but Zuko comes third in that ranking. All she sees when she looks at him is the embodiment of the Fire Nation all nicely wrapped up in one scarred up, grouchy asshole of a firebender; they took Aang\u2019s people away, they took people\u2019s freedom away, they took  Mom  away, and she'll never ever forgive him for that.\n\u00a0\nAt least he knows well enough to keep far away from her. He\u2019s not that stupid; if he sets one foot out of line or puts her or her family in danger, they both know who\u2019s going to come for him.\n\u00a0\nShe can\u2019t for the life of her figure out why Aang actually seems to like him. Toph\u2019s one thing, she was never around for his Avatar hunting phase but of all people, Aang should know better. It\u2019s like he\u2019s forgotten how long and how far they ran from Zuko, like he\u2019s forgotten how scared Katara has been for him and his safety.\n\u00a0\nIf he dies, that\u2019s it. No more airbenders, ever, and no more Aang.\n\u00a0\nShe doesn\u2019t know how it happened and she hates it.\n\u00a0\nAt least the pampered prince has some life skills, she has to admit. He cooks well enough and he hasn\u2019t tried to poison them yet (not that Katara hasn\u2019t been checking, because she  has  ) and he doesn\u2019t complain about doing the dishes after or make snide comments about how it\u2019s women\u2019s work. In fact, the first time in a while that Sokka has said something smart mouthed about it, Zuko boggled at him and mumbled something under his breath about  marines  and  set him on fire  before walking away as if to not catch sexism. That was the single, solitary thing that worked in his favor, and the only thing after his firebending and willingness to teach Aang\u00a0 that kept her from pushing him off the edge of the Air Temple late at night.\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s started sleeping closer lately, though, and Katara\u2019s not sure how she feels about it.\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019d started in a room several levels down but recently migrated to one somewhat closer on the same floor as the rest of them. Not that she\u2019s ever seen him sleep, ever.\n\u00a0\nShe\u2019d have to care about him to try and do that.\n\u00a0\nKatara\u2019s not sure either what he does with his time when he\u2019s not training Aang. Aang\u2019s got the attention span of a goldfish-pus, and Katara learned right away when she was training him in water that the hours and hours and hours she wanted to put in each day were just not going to happen. No way is Zuko going to get more than three out of him at a stretch and they start at sunrise, so she\u2019s got no idea where he goes the rest of the time. She probably should, if she wants to make sure he\u2019s not going to turn around  again  and screw them over.\n\u00a0\n Again .\n\u00a0\nIf he does, it\u2019ll be the very last time.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey Katara, where\u2019s Sparky?\u201d Toph asks and pokes at Katara with an insistent bump of rock under her feet.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t know, don\u2019t care,\u201d is all Katara can tell her. If she wants him, she can track him down herself. Though why she\u2019d want to is a complete mystery, especially after Zuko burned her feet. She\u2019d nearly killed him then, except that a friend had been in need of healing and she\u2019d needed to focus on Toph and not murder.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s been gone a while,\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMaybe he got lost,\u201d Katara replies, purposefully sweet and cheery, \u201cMaybe he\u2019ll stay lost.\u201d\n\u00a0\nToph shakes her head but doesn\u2019t reply, instead looking toward the horizon with a blind, blank stare like she knows  exactly  where Zuko is and she\u2019s not telling. Well, joke\u2019s on her because Katara never asked and she doesn\u2019t want to know.\n\u00a0\nShe sort of really hopes that he never comes back.\n\u00a0\nKatara\u2019s not that lucky, though, because Zuko  does  come back.\n\u00a0\nHe also comes back covered in blood, scar starker than usual against an unnaturally pale, ghost white face, and a lump in his shirt that he cradles in both of his hands.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat in the\u2014\u201c Katara starts and Zuko ignores Sokka\u2019s indignant squawk, marching right up to her with a look of determination on his face. He\u2019d better, not for a  second , even dream of asking her to heal him. He\u2019d better not. Whatever he got into was his own business and he can get himself out.\n\u00a0\nHer face twists in a frown, but Zuko keeps coming. When he reaches her, though, he reaches into his shirt and thrusts both hands out at her.\n\u00a0\nKatara freezes.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPlease,\u201d he rasps, voice little more than a low whisper, \u201cI need your help.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWhat he holds out to her at first only looks like a lump of fur and feathers held together with blood but as she looks, Katara realizes that it\u2019s a baby hawk-weasel, eyes closed in what\u2019s undoubtedly pain, breathing hard and heavy.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNot unlike the banished prince of the Fire Nation.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know you hate me, and that\u2019s fine, you can keep hating me. It\u2019s fine,\u201d he keeps going, \u201cBut I know you have a heart. Please don\u2019t let it die.\u201d\n\u00a0\nZuko looks like he\u2019s about to start  crying .\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKatara\u2019s dreamed about what that might look like and she\u2019s disappointed in how little satisfaction she feels from it. She\u2019s grateful that Aang\u2019s in the middle of earthbending practice right now; he doesn\u2019t need to see this.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy should I?\u201d She asks just to twist the knife, just to see what he does. The animal held between two shaking hands gives a weak little shiver and a wheeze. Katara can\u2019t imagine that it\u2019ll make it, no matter what she does. It might be kinder just to make it quick.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBecause it didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d Zuko whispers, finally. \u201cAll it tried to do was exist.\u201d He sways a bit on his feet, probably from blood loss. \u201cIf you can\u2019t, that\u2019s fine. I know it\u2014 I know it might be hopeless.\u201d\n\u00a0\nZuko looks fucking hopeless right now, and Katara makes up her mind.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSit down before you fall down and let me see,\u201d she snaps and takes the hawk-weasel from him, bending water out of her pouch and using it to examine her unexpected patient. Its energy channels are ripped to shreds and Katara\u2019s not sure how much she can do, but she repairs as much as she can. She\u2019s only been trained to work on humans but she\u2019s surprised to find that they\u2019re not that different; chi follows the same basic paths regardless of species, and she does the best she can.\n\u00a0\nKatara\u2019s not sure how long it takes but she\u2019s vaguely aware of Zuko sitting very, very close, his breathing heavy and ragged, watching her...warily? Hopefully?\n\u00a0\nIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKatara doesn\u2019t dare go too deep while she works but she feels him move further away, running up his pant leg and using some of the water from a bucket to rinse some of the blood off of his skin to reveal a deep, nasty cut that already looks furious in the meat of his thigh. He\u2019s been bleeding from it for a while.\n\u00a0\nMaybe he\u2019ll pass out.\n\u00a0\nZuko does not pass out but he does try and make himself look halfway presentable before coming back to her, just in time for Katara to sigh and wipe at her face, suddenly worn out and not just from the healing process.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWere you able to help?\u201d He asks very, very quietly, and Katara sighs and gestures for him to hold out his hands.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSee for yourself,\u201d she says, and sets the hawk-weasel into his waiting palms. Katara\u2019s always heard that animals can tell bad people from good ones, but that can\u2019t be quite right because the tiny creature only sighs tiredly and nibbles on his thumb, way too softly to do any damage.\n\u00a0\nAnd Zuko\u2019s face goes absolutely slack with relief. He brings his hands up to his chest to tuck the animal into the juncture of his neck and shoulder, more gently than Katara\u2019s ever seen him do anything. She didn\u2019t even know that he knew how.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019ll need a lot of food and rest before it\u2019s ready to go free and it still might not make it. So don\u2019t be surprised.\u201d Katara needs a nap before she deals with anyone else\u2019s nonsense today. She doesn\u2019t even have room in her right now for animosity.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s also just starting to dawn on her that she  did this . No one had ever walked her through something like this and she did it without help, all by herself! If Katara hadn\u2019t been so exhausted, she might have cheered about it. As it is, she just rubs her temples and slumps a little where she sits.\n\u00a0\n\u201c Thank you .\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKatara\u2019s never heard Zuko talk to anyone like that and when she looks to him, the naked relief and gratitude on his face are so sincere that they make her stomach twist in discomfort.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnyone would,\u201d she huffs eventually. She can\u2019t handle his sincerity, not when everything inside her demands he be the villain. Nevertheless, it doesn\u2019t stop her from flopping onto her bedroll to take a power nap ( anyone  wakes her up for any reason and they might have to die) and when she wakes up, it\u2019s nearly sundown.\n\u00a0\nHer friends have let her sleep longer than she thought they would, and someone else cooked dinner. When Katara comes to the fire, Zuko still sits as far away from her as he can get while still being socially acceptable, but his hands are full, and the hawk-weasel looks way more alive and perky than she expected it to. Aang of course thinks it\u2019s precious, and even Sokka can\u2019t resist feeding it tiny scraps of salted meat, even if that means he has to get closer to Zuko to do it.\n\u00a0\nThe prince in question doesn\u2019t make a scene about what she did, nor does he even bring it up, but his eyes look softer than she\u2019s ever seen them. When the hawk-weasel tries to scamper up to his shoulder to tug at a lock of dark hair, he almost laughs as he brings it back down to his lap. It yawns hugely and curls up in the palms of his hands, and Zuko looks like he can\u2019t even dream of moving to disturb it. He just sits there very, very still, eventually moving one hand to stroke soft, easy lines over the little animal\u2019s back.\n\u00a0\nWhen he looks like that, Katara can almost forget who he is.\n\u00a0\n-\n\u00a0\nLater, when Katara\u2019s had long enough to think about it, she pulls him aside and takes care of the cut on his thigh.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not because she likes or cares about him. It\u2019s not as if she cares if that\u2019s what kills him in the end. Aang needs a firebending teacher, and Zuko can\u2019t do that if he\u2019s dead or crippled.\n\u00a0\nShe can\u2019t resist telling him this, and Zuko nods. Of all of them, he knows. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s the first time he\u2019s heard it. It\u2019s not as if she\u2019s even the first person to say it.\n\u00a0\nBut he sure as hell won\u2019t know that Katara remembers how gentle and quiet his hands can be when he has something to take care of, and that Aang\u2019s needs aren\u2019t the only reason she does it.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not fair, Sokka thinks, that Zuko got hit with the talent stick from both ends. It shouldn\u2019t be allowed that he can bend  and  use swords. Sokka\u2019s worked his butt off to get where he is and sometimes the inferiority complex is smothering and heavy but luckily, Zuko makes himself an easy target.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not like Sokka wants to kill him (that\u2019s Katara\u2019s gig and he\u2019ll let her keep it) but it\u2019s so damn easy to roast Zuko that it hurts. It\u2019s so easy it\u2019s like he leaves the opportunities out on purpose just to give Sokka a chance to get some hits in, and it might be insulting but he\u2019s not gonna turn it down. It\u2019d be more insulting if Sokka didn\u2019t take the chances to make fun of him, as obvious as they are, even if Aang pouts at him and even Toph, every so often, implies he needs to chill.\n\u00a0\nWhatever, Sokka thinks. Zuko\u2019s a big boy, he can take it. This is what he gets for being a dick for so long.\n\u00a0\nSokka has no chill.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0What does have chill, however, is the Western Air Temple at night. So much chill.  Freaky  amounts of chill, considering how close they\u2019re not to the poles, but Aang just said something wishy-washy and Air Nomad-y about how it\u2019s because of the height and low air pressure and how\u2019s basically like being on top of a mountain even though they\u2019re not  on top of a mountain. Well, Sokka doesn\u2019t know shit about mountains but it seemed like it made sense to Toph because she nodded about it, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that it gets ridiculously cold at night.\n\u00a0\nNot nighttime-in-the-desert bad, but still not great.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s one thing when you live in the South Pole and expect your existence to be a cold one and quite another to look down and see  green  and  forests  and there you are, freezing your ass off. It\u2019s not fair. It should at least be snowing, like things are supposed to when it\u2019s cold.\n\u00a0\nEvery bit of it sucks.\n\u00a0\nJust for good measure, Sokka gives Aang a misdirected scowl. Just because airbenders can regulate their body temperature to adjust to high altitudes doesn\u2019t mean that the rest of them have it easy. At least he and Katara are used to being cold.\n\u00a0\nPoor Toph ends up latching onto to just about anyone in reach and if she touches Sokka with those cold-ass feet  one more time , he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s gonna do. Nothin\u2019 nice, that\u2019s for sure.\n\u00a0\nNo matter how many times Sokka says it, though, Toph keeps poking her dirty, frigid toes against his leg and Sokka keeps doing nothing about it.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a normal night, as far as things go.\n\u00a0\nThere\u2019s Aang giving gross goo-goo eyes to his sister, there\u2019s his sister giving the complete and total opposite of goo-goo eyes to Zuko, there\u2019s Zuko trying really hard to not look at anybody, and then there\u2019s Toph. Toph, who\u2019s too far away from Sokka to touch him with her feet but in perfect range to touch Zuko with them instead.\n\u00a0\nShe full on sticks her whole foot up his pant leg to touch his calf, and what happens next is simultaneous.\n\u00a0\nZuko shivers and yelps on instinct and Toph goes so still that Sokka thinks she might have died by proxy.\n\u00a0\n\u201c Holy shit ,\u201d are the first words out of her mouth, and Katara doesn\u2019t even have time to say something sassy about profanity before Toph is leaning closer to press herself up against the firebender entirely like she\u2019ll never be warm again and he\u2019s the most expensive space heater ever created, \u201cYou\u2019re so warm!\u201d She cuddles right the fuck up to him, shoving herself under his arm so he\u2019s got no choice but to drape around her shoulders.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s the most hilarious and awkward thing that Sokka\u2019s ever seen, and he\u2019s spent the last few months watching the bridge to the spirit world moon over his baby sister.\n\u00a0\nZuko\u2019s an uncomfortable, horrified statue for a good thirty seconds before he looks down at Toph stubbornly nestled up against him and the lines around in his forehead get a little less tense, and without saying a word he takes in a big breath and then exhales with calm, steady control\u2014 Sokka flinches on instinct but then realizes that no flames come out of him. Instead all he breathes out is warm, dry heat that fills their little section of temple and chases out the chill.\n\u00a0\nSokka...did not know that firebenders could do that. Most firebending he\u2019s seen has been sharp and aggressive and strong\u2014 he\u2019s never seen it used gently or usefully outside of starting the campfire every night.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m keeping this,\u201d Toph says to the lot of them. She doesn\u2019t give Zuko any sort of choice in the matter and he looks like he\u2019s already accepted being a \u2018this\u2019. That\u2019s fine. Everything is fine except that they\u2019re clearly on some other planet where tiny earthbenders call dibs on grouchy princes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s so cool!\u201d Aang chimes in, even though he can regulate his temperature better than any of them and has  no room to talk , \u201cCan you teach me to do that, Sifu Hotman?\u201d\n\u00a0\nAll of Sokka\u2019s roasting and he\u2019s never gotten that glorious, glorious face that means that Zuko is praying for his own death.\n\u00a0\nAang is  diabolical. \n\u00a0\nNevertheless, he mumbles a cranky  maybe when you get your basics down  which isn\u2019t necessarily a yes but also isn\u2019t a no and somehow still manages to imply  never , but it's enough to get Aang off the subject and back to eating, so Sokka sees is as a win. Toph sticks to him like glue, probably because she\u2019s naturally attracted to anything others find irritating and touching Zuko is a huge, massive no-no.\n\u00a0\nExcept that he doesn\u2019t really look mad about it.\n\u00a0\nAwkward, yeah, because he\u2019s about the most awkward dude Sokka\u2019s ever met in his life, but he doesn\u2019t really look mad. Resigned, maybe? Accepting of his fate? That doesn\u2019t seem right. Zuko\u2019s a lot of things, but he\u2019s not great at accepting much of anything.\n\u00a0\nIf Sokka was going to put an actual name to the look on the guy\u2019s face, he\u2019d have to say he kind of looks...happy? Maybe? As happy as somebody like him can get? Sokka doesn\u2019t know what happy looks like on Zuko; he\u2019s never seen it. He doesn\u2019t seem to have a problem with Toph getting up close and personal with him (maybe because he knows she can\u2019t actually see his awkward face?) and he doesn\u2019t seem to mind the touch, either.\n\u00a0\nToph bumps him roughly and Sokka knows she didn\u2019t get him hard enough to warrant the swing to the side his body makes, and on his return he bumps her back but so softly that Toph\u2019s hair doesn\u2019t even move. Katara looks like she wants to throw up or swallow her own tongue but Toph grins toothily at him like he\u2019s just told her an excellent joke.\n\u00a0\nThat\u2019s a dangerous face.\n\u00a0\nThat\u2019s the moment that Sokka knows, for real, that they\u2019re not getting rid of Zuko.\n\u00a0\n-\n\u00a0\nSokka didn\u2019t even know that Zuko owned a jacket but there he is. Looking like a kind of normal human being? In a jacket.\n\u00a0\nA firebender wearing a jacket.\n\u00a0\nExistence is weird as shit.\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s even got the hood up like he doesn\u2019t know how to keep himself and everybody else warm even with the chilly breeze that whips through the temple at night. Like everything else it\u2019s color coded for convenience, deep crimson with a russet colored ruff around the edge of the hood and...a tail?\n\u00a0\nSokka knows the Fire Nation is weird but he\u2019s pretty sure that even they don\u2019t do that.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s kind of a familiar tail, though.\n\u00a0\nSokka narrows his eyes and looks closer and he realizes that it should be a familiar tail because it\u2019s attached to an odd lump going around the back of Zuko\u2019s head, and there\u2019s something really, really weird about seeing someone like Zuko (in a jacket!!) with the tail of a lemur poking out of his hood to curl over his forehead like he\u2019s decided to do something new with his hair.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, uh...you know you\u2019ve got something on your head, right?\u201d\n\u00a0\nZuko glares at him like he thinks he\u2019s dumb as shit.\n\u00a0\nWith jerky hands he pushes the side of his hood away from his neck to reveal Momo\u2019s sleeping face, perfectly happy to be cuddling up with the prince of the Jerk Nation.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe was  cold .\u201d Gold eyes narrow defensively and Zuko draws himself up like he\u2019s waiting for Sokka to throw a punch or just start laughing. Sokka doesn\u2019t laugh at him, though, because even though it looks like Zuko\u2019s itching for a fight his fingers end up tucked into his collar to scratch Momo under the chin. The lemur doesn\u2019t even bother opening his eyes.\n\u00a0\nSokka puts his hands up and shrugs.\n\u00a0\nHe knows when he\u2019s beat.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, man, calm down,\u201d he says flippantly, \u201cNothin\u2019 to get all huffy about.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBecause it feels like a shock that Zuko knows how to be kind but...maybe it shouldn\u2019t be.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhat nobody seems to get about Sparky is that he\u2019s scared out of his mind, like, all the time.\n\u00a0\nLiterally all the time, because Toph can read heartbeats and Zuko\u2019s baseline is several tics higher than everyone else at their most freaked out, and at the slightest hitch he starts doing this breathing thing like that\u2019s the only thing keeping him from flying completely off the handle, and Zuko does that  all the time .\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not a firebender thing, Toph knows, because Uncle\u2019s heart didn\u2019t do that. Uncle\u2019s heart stayed calm and steady and resolute like normal people\u2019s should when they\u2019re relatively calm. But Zuko\u2019s thrums rabbit-mouse quick at its normal.\n\u00a0\nToph understands that seeing folk are blind in their own ways, and maybe it\u2019s because they can see with their eyes that they can\u2019t see that Zuko, as strong and apparently terrifying (???) as he is, is on the verge of a nervous breakdown at any given point in time.\n\u00a0\nHow can she be afraid of him when she knows that?\n\u00a0\nSparky\u2019s not scary, he\u2019s  scared , and Toph\u2019s an asshole but she\u2019s not a fucking predator.\n\u00a0\nShe doubles up on bullying Sokka because it\u2019s good for him and she doubles up on bullying Zuko too but  with love , because the goal is not to just keep him alive so Aang can learn firebending. Nah, man, that\u2019s Katara\u2019s goal.\n\u00a0\nToph wants to domesticate him and see if maybe he can eventually learn how to calm down.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nUncle talked so much about this guy that didn\u2019t seem to line up with what Toph first saw but the more time she spends with him, the more she gets it. He said that his nephew was brave and kindhearted and gentle and  loyal  and the more Toph messes with him and keeps her feet tuned to him, she knows that it\u2019s true.\n\u00a0\nAnd if she\u2019s going to be honest, if they can beat the Fire Lord and Azula, Zuko\u2019s probably going to end up on that throne and they could all really use somebody who\u2019s not murder-y and power hungry in charge of the Fire Nation. She reckons that by keeping Zuko safe and sane she\u2019s securing the future for the rest of them, in a future where they win.\n\u00a0\nSo really,\u00a0 it\u2019s kind of like Toph\u2019s doing her own part in looking after the good of the world. Like an investment.\n\u00a0\nAlso because Zuko\u2019s stressy, anxious existence is like a natural attention getter for her, like the equivalent of somebody constantly throwing their arms up and screaming  look at me!!  The difference of course is that Zuko\u2019s not screaming for her attention. Most of the time he doesn\u2019t seem like he wants anybody\u2019s attention but good grief, the dude needs looking after before his heart gives out just keeping him alive.\n\u00a0\nThat\u2019s what Katara and Sokka and even Aang don\u2019t seem to understand. That, banished or not, Zuko is still a prince. The  only  prince of a very dangerous, volatile nation and if they win and the fire nation survives it, every single person will be looking to Zuko to see what he\u2019ll do. Sokka\u2019s the son of a chief but he\u2019s not the only option they\u2019ve got. Rulers in the Earth Kingdom get voted in. Toph doesn\u2019t know how Air Nomads picked their boss but she assumes it\u2019s based in airbending and wisdom levels.\n\u00a0\nIf they win, Zuko is the  only  person the people will accept as Fire Lord.\n\u00a0\nOzai done fucked up is what he did, she thinks. A perfectly good heir to the Fire Nation and look at it, it\u2019s got anxiety.\n\u00a0\nIf her friends were smart, they\u2019d quit trying to mess him up.\n\u00a0\nIf Uncle were here, Toph feels like that would help.\n\u00a0\nBut Uncle\u2019s not here and Toph\u2019s got more to worry about than a neurotic firebender, but sometimes it feels like he\u2019s the only one she can make an impact on.\n\u00a0\n-\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Toph knows well not to sneak up on Zuko after the first and only time she did it so she announces herself with stomping footsteps during the day and always with her voice when it\u2019s dark.\n\u00a0\nThe play they went to go see was a damn mess and a half.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLike, okay, it definitely wasn\u2019t a flattering portrayal by anybody\u2019s standards (Toph\u2019s not bellyaching about hers but let\u2019s be real, the play was still garbage) but it wasn\u2019t, like, world ending. Katara and Aang are acting  weird  and she found Zuko on the beach with a...crab trap?\n\u00a0\nToph can hear scuttling inside the trap and...squeaking?\n\u00a0\nAt her approach, Zuko shifts towards her and fiddles with the lid. It\u2019s stuck but he doesn\u2019t want to break it, and Toph helps him out with a flick of her toes.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThanks.\u201d He reaches in and pushes aside what sounds like crabs snapping for his fingers and pulls out something little that squeaks and squirms in his hands. Toph hasn\u2019t a clue what it is. It\u2019s gotta show on her face because he keeps talking. \u201cIt\u2019s a turtle-pus.\u201d He gestures for her to hold out her hands and when Toph does, he sets into her hands something soft and squishy with a shell, with little tentacles and things that stick to her hands. \u201cThey like the crabs so you always get one or two in the trap when you pull it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cCan you eat \u2018em?\u201d Toph asks and Zuko shakes his head.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNah. Well, I guess you could if you were desperate. They\u2019re not poisonous but they taste bad. I used to run for the traps\u2026\u201d Zuko trails off and Toph gives him a demanding poke to continue. So many of his childhood stories are nightmare fuel and she wants to hear a happy one for once. \u201cWell, I always wanted to get there first because if I did, I could let them go back in the ocean before Azula got there. Otherwise\u2026\u201d he stops and clenches his jaw and starts doing some deep breathing.\n\u00a0\nSo much for a happy story.\n\u00a0\nToph focuses on the weird feeling of suckers on her hands and she shakes her palms to get it loose. Zuko snorts a little and removes it, popping off the tentacles one by one like a damn expert, and plops it back in the ocean with a soft splash.\n\u00a0\nToph has no idea how anyone can feel safe in the water but there must be something about it, because every single one of them has taken a dip at some point since they got to Ember Island. It scares the hell out of Toph, though. She\u2019s never felt blinder than when she\u2019s found herself in the water.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou just let \u2018em go, huh?\u201d\n\u00a0\nZuko shrugs and rolls up his pant legs to dig his toes in wet sand, piles up tiny mountains around his feet. Toph helps, not with her bending but with her hands, packing it down tight around his ankles. Every so often he swishes the crabs around in the water to make sure they don\u2019t dry out. Toph\u2019s not sure why it matters since they\u2019re going to eat them anyway, but it matters enough to Zuko.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d He replies. \u201cIt didn\u2019t do anything to me. Just doing what turtle-puses do. It can\u2019t help wanting what turtle-puses want. You know?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nToph doesn\u2019t know but she thinks that she might have a better idea now.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd what do you want?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThey sit in silence for a good ten minutes. Even so, without fail, Zuko makes sure to splash their dinner. Toph even helps once or twice.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI want to keep my people safe,\u201d he answers finally. \u201cI want to keep the rest of the world safe from my father. ...I want Uncle to forgive me for being what I am.\u201d What he doesn\u2019t say is  failure  or  worthless  or  traitor  but it all comes out in the low and bitter way he talks. People talk a whole awful lot about how much the Fire Nation hates, but Toph knows that there\u2019s probably nothing Zuko hates more than himself.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf he\u2019s as cool as he sounds, I think he probably already has,\u201d Toph isn\u2019t naturally sympathetic\u00a0 but she can\u2019t let him go down the road he\u2019s on right now. Self loathing is a river and Zuko may be a good swimmer but even he might drown. \u201cI think he just wants you to be happy.\u201d\n\u00a0\nToph doesn\u2019t really know what Uncle wants but she remembers the old guy she had tea with and the love and pride in his voice when he talked about his nephew. There wasn\u2019t a chance in hell that he wouldn\u2019t forgive him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I ever said anything about it, but I met him once. Before this whole thing was a thing.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nZuko goes very still. His toes don\u2019t even crack the sand she\u2019s piled up on them.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe talked you up. Talked about how proud he was and how much he cared about you. That sort of stuff. He brews a mean ginger and jasmine.\u201d This could be a really bad idea. Uncle is a sore spot and when a firebender gets poked, shit can get hot. But instead of exploding, Zuko gives a full body flinch instead, and Toph tugs his legs down deeper into the sand. She squishes it up to his knees and he lets her. \u201cI don\u2019t think somebody like that could ever really let you go. Maybe you made him sad, but sometimes that\u2019s just what happens when you love someone. He gives a crap about you. He gives a whole lot of craps, and maybe you didn\u2019t do things the way he wanted you to but you got there in the end.\u201d Zuko can\u2019t reach the waterline without undigging himself to swish the crabs so Toph does it for him. \u201cYou\u2019re here because you chose it and that\u2019s fucking important.\u201d\n\u00a0\nShe will not ruin the heir to a country.\n\u00a0\nMaybe she can\u2019t dive into the water after him but she can sure as hell throw out a hand and pull him out. Zuko fiddles with the latch on the crab trap.\n\u00a0\n\u201c...do you think the others would be mad if I let dinner go?\u201d\n\u00a0\nToph thinks wistfully about the crab dinner she thought she was going to have and then lets the thought go.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe knew Aang wasn\u2019t gonna eat \u2018em anyway,\u201d Toph grumbles. \u201cNot like there isn\u2019t already food at the house.\u201d They can eat crabs when Sokka feels like catching them himself. \u201cJust let them go. Feels mean to let them sit anyway after they waited all this time.\u201d She bends the latch open and hears Zuko rattle the crabs out of the trap and shoo them back into the ocean. If they\u2019re smart, they\u2019ll stay away from any more traps.\n\u00a0\nIf they\u2019re not, they\u2019ll eat them tomorrow.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nZuko\u2019s hours away from his coronation and he\u2019s scared to death.\n\u00a0\nThey\u2019ve waited as long as they dared while Zuko was recovering and Uncle held down the fort as regent but it\u2019s finally time. Zuko\u2019s whole body still hurts from Azula\u2019s lightning despite regular healing sessions with Katara and he\u2019s not looking forward to the mess he\u2019s responsible for sorting out with the rest of the world, but he knows that, even if he didn\u2019t start it, it\u2019s his mess now.\n\u00a0\nThe world is watching.\n\u00a0\nHe sits on the floor in his old quarters because the idea of setting foot in his father\u2019s old throne room makes him want to throw up. Zuko stares at the unlit candle in front of him but doesn\u2019t light it.\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s not afraid of fire anymore.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you doing alright, Prince Zuko?\u201d\n\u00a0\nNot a prince for long. Zuko thinks, and beckons Uncle in from where he\u2019s peering at him from the doorway. It\u2019s happened so many times by now that he can\u2019t remember when it started. He used to hate it, but now it makes him want to smile.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cCome in, please.\u201d Absently, Zuko rubs his chest with his fingertips. It\u2019s tightly bandaged and the medics keep trying to dope him up for pain, but Zuko\u2019s refused all of it. If he\u2019s going to deal to deal with his father\u2019s council of dickheads, he\u2019s going to do it with a clear head.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you starting a meditation?\u201d Uncle asks and settles down on the other side of Zuko\u2019s candle. \u201cCan a nostalgic old man join you?\u201d\n\u00a0\nZuko does smile, then, and pushes the candle out of the way.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf you\u2019re feeling so nostalgic, we could do it the old fashioned way,\u201d he offers with an opening and closing motion of his hands. \u201cIt always did have a funny way of making me feel better.\u201d It\u2019s strange to be so open about his feelings but Zuko feels like he\u2019s been hollowed out by his experiences and refilled but not necessarily in a bad way. Sometimes, he\u2019s found, what you end up with can be better than what you started with.\n\u00a0\nUncle\u2019s smile goes big and wide and sentimental and he opens his hands in his lap, allowing a tiny flame to bloom in his palms.\n\u00a0\nZuko has never done it like this with anyone else and he never will. He\u2019s not little and scared and frightened of fire anymore but that doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t feel good to be able to trust in someone else\u2019s flames. Most firebenders would rather die than give someone else that control but it gives Zuko so much undeniable comfort.\n\u00a0\nPrince or no, banished or no, future Fire Lord or not, this is the only person he knows who\u2019s never hurt him.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s only when his eyes are closed that he feels like he can finally speak.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I can do this.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou can, my nephew. Think of all that you\u2019ve done on your way to get here.\u201d Uncle Iroh stubbornly keeps his eyes closed even though Zuko opens his to scowl at him. \u201cIt is a difficult, unyielding road that you\u2019ve taken, and it is also the best road. You will do well, but you don\u2019t have to do it alone.\u201d Zuko closes his eyes again because he thinks that if he keeps looking, he\u2019s going to start crying.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow, though? How are you so sure I\u2019ll be a good Fire Lord?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThere\u2019s a sudden weight on his knee and Zuko looks down. One of the palace pygmy-pumas has her front paws on his leg and chirps when he gives her his attention. Ozai always hated having them around and Azula went out of her way to try and remove them all in the most horrendous ways she could think of, but word got out that Zuko likes them and all of a sudden, he can\u2019t turn a corner without being followed by something furry. An orange kitten peeks around her and clambers up immediately into Zuko\u2019s lap, and he adjusts his hands to make room for both of them.\n\u00a0\nUncle\u2019s watching again, and when Zuko meets his eyes he nods downwards into his lap.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBecause of that. Because you\u2019re good, and loyal, and  stubborn , with a kind and gentle heart.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe world has tried its best to crush it out of him and failed, over and over again. Zuko\u2019s not ashamed of it and he\u2019s trying his best not to find shame in love and care. He  loves  Uncle with everything he has and spent too damn long refusing to acknowledge it. He won\u2019t keep doing it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank you for everything you\u2019ve done for me,\u201d Zuko whispers, \u201cI know it\u2019s been a hard road for you too.\u201d He remembers being horrible and bratty and pigheaded and in so much  constant pain  and how Uncle never, ever left him. The only times they separated, Zuko had been the one to leave.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh,  Zuko .\u201d No honorifics, no epithets. Just his name. Uncle\u2019s eyes are big and shiny and Zuko is immediately horrified, but he smiles hugely even though he looks like he\u2019s definitely gonna cry. \u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to do for your children.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd Zuko can\u2019t help it now, he leans forward and buries his face in his hands to try and hide his tears. He sobs helplessly into his palms and, just like years ago, Uncle\u2019s careful of his guests when he reaches across the space to pull him close.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0"
