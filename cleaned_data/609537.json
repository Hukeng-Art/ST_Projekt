    "text": "The weather outside is actually frightful and Stiles has no-one to share the irony with. Everyone standing behind him in the line for the six thirty flight out to Los Angeles looks indignant and tired. Even the dude in the Santa hat surrounded by a dozen kids seems as though he\u2019s lost his holiday cheer.\n\u201cSo,\u201d he rubs his temples. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me you don\u2019t know when we\u2019re going to be able to take off, but that you\u2019re really sorry and have a Merry Christmas?\u201d\nThe girl\u2019s reindeer ears seem to actually droop with her apologetic expression.\n\u201cWe are very sorry, Mr Stilinski; it\u2019s just with the snow getting thicker\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he says softly, thinking about how many calls he\u2019s going to have to make. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d He smiles briefly at her and heads dejectedly into the half empty waiting area.\nThey\u2019re the last flight of the evening and the airport is tiny; he\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019s been in bigger coffee shops. The snow is falling fast and he\u2019s sure as hell not going to try and persuade them to make a plane fly in that kind of weather.\nStiles may or may not have issues with flying as it is. He gets that they stay up via science and magic, he really does; doesn\u2019t mean he trusts it all that much.\nHalf an hour later and he\u2019s called his dad to tell him not to expect him home any time soon, and is trying to persuade his best friend not to hire a snow plough to come and collect him.\n\u201cScott, bro\u2019 I told you, the second the weather is safe to fly in you know I\u2019m out of here. I can\u2019t make the plane fly though, whatever your personal thoughts on me being Superman are.\u201d\nStiles shifts in his seat, half watching the snow currently blowing up a storm through the wide, shiny windows of the airport and half focused on listening to his best friend\u2019s erratic breathing as he talks himself into a panic. Someone sits down next to him and instinctively he folds his legs up to give them some space.\nHe\u2019s considerate like that.\n\u201cShe\u2019s not giving birth now, dude, I\u2019ll be there. Oh my god, your child is not the next Jesus; Allison\u2019s not due till the thirtieth. Scott\u2014Scott\u2014I\u2019m hanging up now. Aw no, you hang up. No you, you.\u201d He grins at their ability to still be idiots at twenty five. \u201cOn three?\u201d\nThe person sitting next to him shifts and mutters, \u201cChrist, one of you hang up,\u201d and Stiles turns to glare at him. He\u2019s about to say something about the nature of personal, private calls and of other people minding their own business, but words sort of fly out into the blizzard when he gets an eyeful of the guy\u2019s profile.\n\u201cDerek Hale?\u201d\nThe guy starts and he snaps his head round to look at Stiles, \u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n\u201cScott, I gotta go, I think I\u2019m about to be murdered.\u201d\nStiles snaps his phone shut on Scott\u2019s yell of, \u201cWait, what if she gives birth at church?!\u201d and holds up both his hands in supplication. \u201cDude.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know my name?\u201d\n\u201cUh, we went to school together? Stiles Stilinski, I was a couple of years below you, but I played lacrosse junior year with you. You once gave me a bruise like, this big,\u201d he widens his hands right across his ribs to emphasize his point.\nDerek\u2019s eyes follow the movement and then flick back up to his face, \u201cStilinski\u2026 The Sheriff\u2019s kid?\u201d\n\u201cYeah!\u201d\n\u201cYou got me arrested once.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014whoa, awkward that you remember that. Look, it wasn\u2019t my fault.\u201d\n\u201cYou called them from my own house.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you were going to kill Scott.\u201d\nDerek\u2019s face scrunches up, \"The kid who now thinks his baby is gonna be Jesus? What a tragic loss to society that would have been.\u201d\n\u201cSo you don\u2019t deny you were trying to kill him?\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to kill him,\u201d Derek rolls his eyes. \u201cIt was better I fuck with him than let Jackson actually hurt him.\u201d\n\u201cSweet.\u201d\nDerek crooks a grin at him and it\u2019s like Stiles is sixteen and crushing madly, ridiculously on the hot older senior he could never have. \u201cSo I\u2019ve been told before.\u201d\nThis time it\u2019s Stiles who rolls his eyes but he can\u2019t retort because his damned Blackberry starts buzzing in his pocket. \u201cGah!\u201d He slides low into the seat and pulls out the cursed piece of plastic as Derek goes back to glaring moodily at the paper. Of course he actually read the financial section. Stiles tugs off his glasses and shoves them in his pocket.\n\u201cDanny! How in the hell are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cStiles, why have I just been informed by Lydia you\u2019re leaving Michigan a day early?\u201d\n\nStiles groans, cursing the day he realised his own damn staff were in cahoots to never let him do anything privately and not firing them all on the spot.\n\u201cWell, you won\u2019t believe this but long story short I was trying to leave and now I\u2019m stuck in the tiniest, dankest airport that ever was and oh hey, you\u2019ll never guess who\u2019s sitting next to me!\u201d\nDerek turns to shoot him what Stiles can only assume is his attempt at a pleading look and Stiles falters when Danny asks who in an exasperated tone.\n\u201cUh, Lady Gaga,\u201d he says vaguely, still staring at Derek in confusion. Derek purses his lips together as if he\u2019s annoyed at being interchanged for the Queen of all things fabulous and looks away.\u00a0 Stiles clears his throat. \u201cAnyway man, what\u2019s up?\u201d\n\n\u201cStiles, don\u2019t act like this isn\u2019t a big deal. You weren\u2019t finished there.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook Danny, I know this project\u2019s important, I do, but I just wanna go home. I don\u2019t\u2014 Look, let\u2019s talk this over when I\u2018m less fried, man.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a beat and then Danny sighs. Stiles can just picture him sitting in his heavenly office (somehow so much more comfortable and more stylish than Stiles\u2019 because Erica is an evil, evil person who refuses to let Stiles have nice things), pinching the bridge of his nose. Erica\u2019s probably listening in, tapping a pen against her desk and sighing over Stiles and his inability to do anything right.\n\n\u201cYou said this is what you wanted.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d he glances surreptitiously at Derek, whose eyes are firmly on the paper and then swallows, tugging at his tie. \u201cCan we please talk about this when I\u2019m home?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you promise not to avoid me and spend all your time playing video games in Scott and Allison\u2019s den?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t promise I won\u2019t spend some time doing that.\u201d\n\n\u201cHard to believe you\u2019re in control of an extremely large, successful company.\u201d \n\nStiles grins. \u201cYou know me, big fan of being a living embodiment of all things ironic.\u201d\nBeside him Derek snorts and Stiles resists the urge to nudge the guy in the ribs.\n\u201cFine,\u201d Danny says finally. Stiles punches the air enthusiastically. \u201cBut, we\u2019re talking this through tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cSometimes I think you guys forget I\u2019m technically your boss,\u201d Stiles says crossly.\nDanny laughs, somewhat hysterically as if he\u2019s thinking the same thing and possibly wishing it weren\u2019t true and then hangs up. Bastard. If he weren\u2019t Stiles\u2019 favourite person he would totally fire him.\nHe glances over to where the dude in the Santa hat is trying to distract a little girl from getting antsy and crying all over her stressed mother. To his left an old couple are sitting, seemingly content, holding hands and watching the snow fall. Stiles shifts feeling suddenly, desperately, lonely and glances at Derek.\n\u201cSo, you going home for Christmas?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Derek says shortly, folding the paper to examine the sports and then scoffing and waving the whole thing at him. \u201cYou want this?\u201d\nStiles shakes his head. \u201cNah, I\u2019m good, thanks,\u201d he waves his phone at Derek. \u201cConstant news feed straight here.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s never as well written online.\u201d\n\u201cOh I see, you\u2019re one of those people.\u201d\nDerek raises an eyebrow at him and Stiles wiggles his own back. \u201cStuck in the twentieth century types, you know,\u201d he waves his hands around. \u201cOooh, the internet is bad for your health and mmm newspapers just smell nice and feel special between your fingers.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty big leap from my offering you the paper.\u201d\nStiles grins, \u201cYou were weird at school too; it wasn\u2019t that much of a leap.\u201d\n\u201cI was weird?\u201d Derek retorts,\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re the one who still wears odd socks.\u201d\nCaught by surprise, Stiles glances down at his socks and smiles fondly. \u201cYeah, I couldn\u2019t decide which pair I liked more. Besides, it\u2019s good luck.\u201d\nDerek glances out into the snow and then back to where they\u2019re sitting waiting on a flight that\u2019s already delayed by an hour and a half. \u201cUh huh.\u201d\n\u201cYour optimism is delightful.\u201d\n\u201cYours is annoying.\u201d\nStiles smiles down at his phone and then they both look up when the lady from the tiny gift shop comes over and informs them she\u2019s closing in a few minutes. He leaps up and follows her back over, grabbing at as much random candy as he can.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to continue sitting by me if you eat all that and then throw up,\u201d Derek informs him as he passes by to consider the pitiful book collection.\n\u201cPfft please, I have a stomach of steel,\u201d Stiles says, patting his shirt fondly.\nDerek glances at where his hand is and then slowly back up at Stiles in a considering fashion. Stiles feels his mouth go dry and swallows slowly. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go\u2014buy these.\u201d\nHe can feel Derek watching him walk away and it takes everything in his power not to casually strip off all his clothes and throw himself at the guy.\n*\nThey collapse back into their chairs and Stiles groans as he checks the tiny old tv screen above them still showing their flight as DELAYED.\n\u201cHow will Santa know to deliver my presents here?\u201d\nDerek snorts. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll find a way. Besides, if you\u2019re still anything like you were back in high school you\u2019re certainly not on his nice list.\u201d\n\u201cHey, I was gem, shut up.\u201d\n\u201cPretty sure there was never a time I walked past Harris\u2019 classroom and you weren\u2019t in there doing detention.\u201d\nStiles files away the fact Derek noticed him at all and glowers at him.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not exactly a peach yourself, you know.\u201d\n\u201cBut, I don\u2019t actually believe in Santa so I know I\u2019m getting presents; from real people.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe they\u2019ll all decide this was the year you didn\u2019t deserve any.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Derek says soberly and then looks away, staring at his hands moodily.\nSo Stiles is officially the worst at killing the mood. He fidgets in his seat and glances around; the old couple are snoozing quietly next to each other and the little girl who looked like she was going to cry is passed out in her mother\u2019s lap. He wonders if he could catch some shut eye, but this might be the one and only time he\u2019s ever alone with Derek Hale and he needs to use that to his advantage.\n\u201cYou wanna play snap?\u201d\nDerek turns to look at him in bewilderment and Stiles waves the playing cards he snagged at the till at him. \u201cI can\u2019t play poker for shit, but I\u2019m damn quick when it comes to snap.\u201d\n\u201cYou want to play snap,\u201d Derek says slowly.\n\u201cYeah. Come on, like you don\u2019t want to? Look, they\u2019re even Star Wars themed\u2014coolest pack of cards ever actually,\u201d he muses as he looks down at Han Solo\u2019s face.\n\u201cFine,\u201d Derek says wearily. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we could be doing something productive with our time.\u201d\nStiles raises an eyebrow and inclines his head, \u201cIn an airport with very little reception and no decent tv? Hey man, if you can find something better we could be doing I\u2019m all ears.\u201d\nDerek\u2019s ears actually pink up a little at that and Stiles wonders what he\u2019s thinking. He shuffles the cards deftly, tossing them between his hands and watches Derek watch him avidly.\nInteresting.\nHe splits the pack and passes half to Derek, \u201cYou know how to play, right?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I was never five years old.\u201d\n\u201cNow that I would believe.\u201d\n\u201cShut up.\u201d\nStiles grins at him and then feels his eyes widen as Derek loosens his tie suddenly. The bare, tanned skin of his throat is tantalising and Stiles wants to lean forward and lick it all over. He clears his own throat and looks away. When he turns his gaze back to Derek he\u2019s pretty sure the guy\u2019s smirking and he narrows his eyes, oh two can play at that game.\nCasually, he pulls his glasses back out of his pocket, sliding off his jacket and throwing it on the seat next to him. He sits down on the floor right in front of Derek, crossing his legs and slips on his glasses before looking back up at Derek expectantly. Derek\u2019s staring at him and Stiles tilts his head innocently.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2014nothing,\u201d Derek says finally and then turns to stand up and shuck his own jacket. Stiles can\u2019t even avoid looking at his ass and doesn\u2019t try.\nDerek sits down next to him with an exaggerated wide smile, \u201cReady?\u201d He cocks an eyebrow and flips his own cards easily around in one hand.\nStiles drags his eyes from watching Derek\u2019s fingers and licks his lips, \u201cGo.\u201d\nHe slams down his first card and its total chaos as Derek\u2019s just as quick. With each card he can feel himself leaning closer and closer to the floor when Derek yells. \u201cSnap!\u201d\nStiles jerks his head back. \u201cFucker!\u201d\nDerek grins, teeth white and the way his whole face lights up with it is spellbinding. Stiles wants to lean forward and wrap his hands around Derek\u2019s tie, use it to reel him in and kiss the grin right off.\nInstead, he drags the cards in again and shuffles. \u201cSo, you happy to be going home?\u201d\nDerek shrugs, scratching idly at his scruff. \u201cLooking forward to seeing my sister and my mom; not so much my uncle.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d\n\u201cI told him I was done with the family business last week, \u2018s\u2019why I\u2019ve been in Michigan, tying up loose ends around the office up here.\u201d\n\u201cNot having fun anymore?\u201d\nDerek lifts his eyebrows. \u201cAre you?\u201d\nStiles ponders the question. He thinks about the dream he had when he was fifteen, thinks about how hard he fucking worked to make it a reality and how fun and awesome it was to start with. Then he thinks about the way his stomach drops when the phone rings and the fact he doesn\u2019t see his dad for months on end. He thinks about lonely hotel rooms and meetings with guys ten, fifteen years older than him all looking overworked and exhausted before they\u2019ve even hit fifty.\nHe thinks about the fact he\u2019s about to be a godfather and the only excuse he might have for missing the birth is the fact he was out here dealing with an expansion he doesn\u2019t need but that the shareholders want.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he says finally. \u201cAnd, I think my second in command might know that.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t ever look like you\u2019re having fun,\u201d Derek says softly.\nStiles glances at him in surprise, \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI see you around occasionally, at parties and luncheons,\u201d Derek\u2019s lips curl on a smirk. \u201cYou wore some ridiculous red suit to Kitsch\u2019s Christmas Do last year and he couldn\u2019t shut up about it all night.\u201d\nStiles laughs remembering. \u201cYeah, that old man cannot take a joke. I was being a modern Santa.\u201d\n\u201cYou looked happier then,\u201d Derek muses.\n\u201cDude, I can\u2019t believe you never came and said hi, you acted like you barely remembered me!\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to.\u201d\nStiles clutches his chest, tugging at his tie, suddenly feeling nervous and upset and tries to play it off. \u00a0\u201cOuch, why not?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know if you\u2019d remember me.\u201d\nWell that\u2019s just, fucking adorable. He can\u2019t imagine Derek being nervous about anything.\n\u201cAre you serious?\u201d he pushes his glasses back up his nose and raises an eyebrow. \u201cOf course I would\u2019ve remembered you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not very good at the whole meet and greet thing in general. If you\u2019d not known who the fuck I was then I don\u2019t\u2014I just don\u2019t like feeling awkward.\u201d\n\u201cHow the hell do you get by in our world?\u201d\nDerek smirks, \u201cI fake it.\u201d\nThe whole pack of cards almost flies out of Stiles\u2019 hands, \u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t have wanted you to do that with me.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d have had that problem,\u201d Derek says quietly, eyes boring into Stiles\u2019.\nStiles lets him take the pack from his limp hands and tries to remember how to breathe as Derek gives him half back.\n\u201cAgain?\u201d\nHe nods wordlessly.\n*\nAn hour later and Derek is painstakingly trying to teach him how to play poker. Stiles knows how; he\u2019s been playing with his dad since he was a kid and swindling friends out of money for years. But people always seem to believe him when he says he\u2019s shit at it and it never fails to work in his favour.\nHe\u2019s planning on it working for him here too.\nThe airport is quiet, the only attendant desk closed and the lights dimmed. It\u2019s past eleven and their flight has been delayed by five hours so far. Stiles has discovered the bathroom\u2019s excessive, colourful graffiti and that the coffee machine doesn\u2019t like him very much.\nDerek managed to make it work but wouldn\u2019t tell him how.\nApparently, Derek is still a bastard like that.\n\u201cOh my god, it\u2019s so hot in here,\u201d Stiles groans. He whips his tie off and wraps it around his head.\nDerek lifts an eyebrow in amusement and then splays his cards out. \u201cRoyal Flush.\u201d\n\u201cFuck.\u201d Stiles tosses his own set down on the floor. \u201cI\u2019m too hot to concentrate.\u201d\n\u201cYou could always strip down to your boxers but I don\u2019t think the rest of the airport would appreciate it.\u201d\n\u201cHa ha.\u201d Stiles glowers at him and then pauses. \u201cThe rest? As in yourself not included.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Derek\u2019s face flushes pink and he gathers all the cards up, snaps them together and flips them as a pack from hand to hand. It\u2019s ridiculously sexy. \u201cI count as part of the airport at large.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, sure.\u201d Stiles feels his lips quirk into a smile and grabs at the pack. \u201cOne more game? You wanna raise the stakes?\u201d\n\u201cFrom the five bucks you had in your pocket and your last pack of skittles?\u201d Derek raises his eyebrows. \u201cLet\u2019s not get too crazy.\u201d\n\u201cTwenty bucks.\u201d\n\u201cSteady on.\u201d\n\u201cFine, keys to my Porsche and you can have my tie.\u201d\n\u201cNot that you\u2019re going to win but what do you get in return?\u201d\nStiles squints at him and then grins. \u201cYou can punch Jackson Whittemore in the face for me when we\u2019re home.\u201d\nDerek snorts. \u201cDone.\u201d\nHe wins, easily; Derek has so many tells Stiles has a list a mile long in his head already.\nDerek looks shell-shocked and Stiles shrugs. \u201cGuess you were a good teacher after all.\u201d\n\u201cOr you cheated.\u201d Derek takes the cards from him. \u201cI\u2019m dealing.\u201d\n\u201cI am offended dude, and you\u2019re still punching Jackson for me.\u201d\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t you just do it?\u201d\n\u201cBecause he scares me,\u201d Stiles pouts, jutting out his bottom lip in an exaggerated fashion.\nDerek\u2019s eyes flick to his mouth and he clears his throat. \u201cLiar.\u201d\n\u201cFine, I\u2019d just find it endlessly amusing man, that guy\u2019s had it coming for years. Plus, you know; it would actually hurt him coming from you. Me, the one time I punched him I got a hairline fracture and a lecture from my dad about my fist positioning. I think he was more pissed I made a shitty punch than the fact I hit someone, to be honest. He tried to look angry but I reckon everyone secretly thinks Jackson deserves a face full of pain.\u201d\n\u201cA face full of pain.\u201d\n\u201cYep,\u201d Stiles digs his fingers into the knuckles of his right hand. \u201cYou can still feel the chip a little bit if you push hard enough.\u201d He sticks his hand out and hesitantly, Derek runs his fingers along his knuckles. There was nothing sexual about the way Stiles was thinking ten seconds preciously but Derek\u2019s fingertips running up and down his skin is quickly making the air vanish from the room.\nHe swallows and pulls his hand back. \u201cWar scars,\u201d he winks at Derek. \u201cI am officially a badass.\u201d\nDerek huffs a laugh and rolls up his shirt sleeve to show him an impressive scar curved along his inner elbow. \u201cShark bite.\u201d\n\u201cNo way,\u201d Stiles reaches to touch it and Derek\u2019s arm breaks out into goose bumps as he tracks the scar. \u201cSeriously. Seriously.\u201d\n\u201cNah,\u201d Derek sits back and rests his hands behind him. \u201cCut it on a jagged piece of sheet metal at one of the factories last year. Bled all over the floor and my secretary fainted.\u201d\nStiles is distracted by the way Derek\u2019s fitted shirt stretches across his chest in his new seating position and by the fact his shoulders are so broad and wide and his forearms are peeking out from his rolled sleeves and\u2014\n\u201cThe shark story is cooler.\u201d He says suddenly, trying to get his thoughts under control. \u201cUnless you like, gallantly carried her from the scene whilst still bleeding and managed to walk through some smoke while you were at it.\u201d\nDerek laughs, tipping his head back and it\u2019s like fucking porn is being acted out in front of him here. He\u2019s going to die.\n\u201cShe\u2019s fifty six; I think she\u2019d be horrified if I tried to lift her anywhere.\u201d\nMmmm, Derek could lift Stiles up though. He really could.\nHe clears his throat and flips a card up in the air.\n\u201cSo, ten grand, all in?\u201d\n\u201cTen grand? What, you just got it lying around?\u201d\nStiles shrugs. \u201cYeah, give it to your favourite charity; I already do that.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know I\u2019m going to win?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t; you can see it or raise.\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cTwenty five; use it to buy a plane so that next time we don\u2019t get stuck in a damn\u00a0airport for seven hours.\u201d\n\u201cHey man, I have found this whole evening a delight and I feel offended you don\u2019t feel the same way. Thirty.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say I hadn\u2019t enjoyed the company, thirty five.\u201d\n\u201cFifty! And, you have to use your words, Derek. I can\u2019t read your mind you know.\u201d\nDerek narrows his eyes, \u201cYou\u2019ve been playing me.\u201d\n\u201c\u2019Scuse me?\u201d His hands slip as he flips the cards and he looks up at Derek owlishly in an attempt of innocence.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been losing, ridiculously badly, and suddenly you\u2019re confident enough to bet fifty grand? Totally trying to con me.\u201d\n\u201cI would never,\u201d he says quickly.\nDerek grabs the pack off him and shuffles. \u201cPlay like you obviously can, all bets are out, I win you have to walk across the floor on your hands. And, every time you can\u2019t make it to the other side you have to tell me something you\u2019ve never told anyone else.\u201d\nIt\u2019s hands down the most creative bet Stiles has ever heard. And Erica comes up with some extremely inventive ones when she\u2019s drunk.\n\u201cFine,\u201d he says finally. \u201cBut if I win you have to say \u2018Stiles Stilinski is a god\u2019 into my phone recorder and I\u2019ma set it as my ringtone.\u201d\nDerek stares at him for a moment and then grins, shaking his head at him. \u201cOkay, fine.\u201d\nDerek fucking wipes the floor with him.\nStiles sits back in horror when they finish. \u201cWhat the hell?!\"\n\u201cYou think you\u2019re the only one who can play someone?\u201d Derek\u2019s stretching his legs out in front of him looking smug and he nods at the open space of the airport. \u201cGo on.\u201d\n\u201cSeriously?\u201d\n\u201cWould you have made me record that message?\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2014no, of course not. Oh my god\u2014 ok, fine, yes.\u201d He scowls standing and un-tucking his shirt. He kicks off his shoes and aims them both at Derek; who bats them away easily.\n\u201cWait,\u201d Derek beckons him forward and instinctively Stiles walks towards him.\n\u201cWhat, you gonna tie my hands together or something to make it even harder?\u201d\nDerek\u2019s eyebrows shoot into his hairline and Stiles snickers to himself before feeling the smirk on his face die as Derek reaches towards him and slowly takes his glasses off. He\u2019s suddenly breathless with how intimate the gesture is. He can smell the faint hint of Derek\u2019s aftershave, see where the grain of his stubble ends on his neck and Derek\u2019s eyes are warm, intense, as they study him.\n\u201cRight,\u201d he says after a minute or an hour\u2014 who knows\u2014 and the moment\u2019s gone. Derek steps away, folds his glasses up and pops them in his shirt pocket.\n\u201cGood luck,\u201d he says smirking and resting his arms against the chairs, settling in on the floor.\n\u201cI hate you.\u201d\n\u201cHate is such a strong word.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, and I\u2019m feeling it right now.\u201d\n\u201cPut it all in your arms then.\u201d\n\u201cOh, someone\u2019s funny.\u201d\n\u201cI try.\u201d\nStiles stomps over to the far wall of the airport where the trolleys are lined up. He\u2019s so relieved theirs was the only flight left and that there are thirty people in the seating area tops, all of whom are asleep bar Derek.\nHe also can\u2019t help but think this is the most fun he\u2019s had in forever. Who knew Derek Hale with his permanent scowl and terrifying glares (and this is the dude at seventeen who knows how much scarier that special thing he used to do with his eyebrows has gotten over the years) would be hilarious, and fun, and all kinds of Stiles\u2019 type. He\u2019s always thought Derek was hot, ridiculously so. But he never actually thought there was any humour or even personality under the sexy cheekbones and permanent bed hair.\nHe was so wrong and now he\u2019s kind of screwed.\n\u201cI hope you appreciate this.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I will,\u201d Derek says easily before gesturing with a hand. \u201cCome on, stop procrastinating, get on your hands.\u201d\n\u201cThat sounded filthy, just so you know.\u201d\nDerek flushes and glares at him. It\u2019s not nearly as terrifying when his cheeks are pink.\nStiles sighs and bends to push himself up into a wobbly handstand.\n\u201cYes!\u201d He yells before his legs flail and he collapses in a heap.\nHe hears the click of a camera and rolls over to see Derek holding up his phone.\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind me, first fact please.\u201d\n\u201cSomething I\u2019ve never told anyone?\u201d\n\u201cYep, and I\u2019ll know if you\u2019re lying.\u201d\n\u201cHow though, how will you actually know.\u201d\nDerek shrugs. \u201cYou\u2019re easy to read.\u201d\nStiles squirms and thinks for a second. \u201cUhhhh, it was me that trod on Finstock\u2019s megaphone back in ninth grade.\u201d\nDerek\u2019s laughter is loud and outrageously adorable, seriously, Stiles is outraged at its audacity to be so damn adorable.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you let Greenberg take the fall for that.\u201d\n\u201cDude, I was fourteen and Coach scared the shit out of me.\u201d\n\u201cHe made Greenberg do suicides for months, poor kid.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but he hated me more; he would have made me do awful things Derek, seriously awful things.\u201d\n\u201cWhat a shame you didn\u2019t ever confess and bulk up enough to be able to manage walking across a hallway on your hands.\u201d Derek lifts his hand. \u201cCome on, Stiles, a bet\u2019s a bet.\u201d\nHe gets a third of the way and starts cheering before losing his balance once again and confessing he didn\u2019t like the way Scott\u2019s mom cut his hair for years before he was old enough to go to a barbers by himself.\nWhen he falls at the halfway line he tells Derek he once tried to run away to New York just to piss his dad off but found himself feeling guilty half an hour in and went home and made dinner instead.\nHe collapses twice more and announces he hates going to sleep in the dark but he makes himself anyway and that he didn\u2019t tell Scott he was bi until was nineteen but he told Danny when he was sixteen and Scott still doesn\u2019t know he wasn\u2019t the first to know. Derek raises an eyebrow and Stiles shrugs, feeling the burn in his shoulders. \u201cDanny kind of got it; Scott would\u2019ve wanted to be supportive but like, not had a clue where to start. It would have been nice and all, but I needed realistic help, not constantly being reassured I was loved and all that crap.\u201d\n\u201cI told my mom when I was seventeen and she told me she\u2019d known for years,\u201d Derek says softly.\n\u201cMoms do tend to know that kind of shit before we do, right,\u201d Stiles says wistfully thinking of his own mother and how much he misses her. \u201cI miss my mom.\u201d He glances at Derek and waves a hand. \u201cThat\u2019s not a secret, I just do.\u201d\n\u201cMy dad left when I was eleven; it\u2019s not the same, I know, but\u2014being without that person is,\u201d Derek exhales sharply. \u201cIt\u2019s tough.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, it really is.\u201d\n\u201cI ran into him once in Chicago,\u201d Derek clucks his tongue in disdain and then looks at him very seriously. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that there a shit people out there when the good ones are gone.\u201d\nStiles smiles wobbly at him and then rolls up onto his hands and knees. \u201cShe\u2019d have gone on and on about you and your magic coloured eyes, man.\u201d\nDerek stares at him in surprise. \u201cMy what.\u201d\n\u201cMagic you know,\u201d Stiles waves a dusty hand at him. \u201cEver changing and multi coloured.\u201d\n\u201cI have magic eyes,\u201d Derek says faintly.\n\u201cYep,\u201d Stiles groans as he flips up onto his hands again. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t make you any less evil right now.\u201d\nOn his sixth attempt he gets two feet from their seats and just, gives in. \u201cI can\u2019t\u2014I\u2019m dying. It\u2019s impossible.\u201d\nDerek sniffs and stands abruptly before pulling off his shirt altogether and dropping onto his hands and fucking waltzing away from Stiles right across to the wall at the far end.\nStiles can feel his mouth hanging open. Derek drops back onto his feet grinning and saunters back over, tugging at his undershirt. \u201cWasn\u2019t that hard at all.\u201d\n\u201cWitchcraft,\u201d Stiles says pointing an accusing finger at him. \u201cHow\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou concentrate too much on keeping your legs up; it distracts you.\u201d\n\u201cMy legs,\u201d Stiles echoes as Derek\u2019s eyes linger on said legs. \u201cSure.\u201d\nThere\u2019s suddenly a crackling overhead and for a second Stiles feels hope burst across his chest; are they finally getting their flight?\nNo they are not.\nIt\u2019s an invitation for them to check themselves in at the motel attached to the airport with apologies about a lack of available rooms.\nStiles glances at Derek and sees him looking straight back before hunching his shoulders. \u201cCould get some shut eye, catch some zzs,\u201d he says aiming for casual.\nDerek nods. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely we\u2019ll be flying out tonight anyway.\u201d\nStiles groans and squints at his phone. Wordlessly Derek passes him his glasses and Stiles nods his appreciation; he\u2019s not blind but it\u2019s dark and he\u2019s tired and yeah he just, needs them right now to try and focus on something that isn\u2019t Derek\u2019s hands or his eyes or his whole secretly awesome self.\nMidnight. It\u2019s officially Christmas Eve and they\u2019re stuck in an airport. His whole entire crazy ass\u00a0life. Then he looks back over to where Derek is pulling his jacket on and sees the strip of skin between his pants and his shirt appear as he stretches up, the way his shirt is wrinkled beyond saving because he\u2019s been walking across his hands in an airport and sitting on the dirty floor playing cards with Stiles all night and decides it could be a lot worse.\n*\n\u201cOne bed; are they serious?\u201d\nSo, it could be worse. It really is so much worse.\nStiles drops his laptop bag inside the door and wants to bury his head in his hands. He cannot get into the same bed as Derek; he\u2019ll wake up humping the poor guy.\nDerek hums as he hangs his jacket on the back of the shitty grey chair before walking back towards him.\n\u201cYou wanna toss a coin?\u201d\n\u201cSo, that you can trick me and I end up on the floor?\u201d\n\u201cYou think I\u2019d do that?\u201d\n\u201cI know you, you\u2019re a wily one, man.\u201d\nDerek smirks and is suddenly very close, leaning towards Stiles before reaching behind him and tugging his hand from the door handle.\n\u201cI promise I don\u2019t kick.\u201d\n\u201cWell I do, and I sing apparently, and bite,\u201d Stiles adds; remembering Scott shoving him away frantically when they were eleven and screeching about his arm bleeding and that he was dying. Stiles had been having a very vivid dream about wrestling a sheep.\nHe tosses his glasses somewhere on the bedside table and then looks back at Derek expectantly.\n\u201cWhat do you reckon?\u201d\nDerek tilts his head to one side just, looking at him again and Stiles doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll ever get used to the kind of laser like scrutiny of his gaze. It makes him feel warm from head to toe.\n\u201cNot so keen on the singing, but I can live with the biting,\u201d and then abruptly Derek yanks on his tie and pulls him in to kiss him.\nStiles lets out a noise of surprise before grabbing at Derek\u2019s shirt and crushing the material between his fingers, pulling Derek as close as possible. Stiles groans as Derek lets his weight fall into him, his whole body arching into Stiles\u2019 as they kiss like they\u2019ve been starving for it. Stiles opens his mouth wide, lets Derek slide his tongue inside and push against his own demanding, claiming, oh so deliciously. They slip to the side and Stiles feels his back hit the desk, the lamp clattering to the floor and Stiles laughs because they\u2019re totally going to destroy the motel room and it\u2019s going to be so fucking hot. Derek kisses his smile, licks along his teeth and then presses kisses along his jaw, hands divesting him of his shirt and impatiently tugging at his undershirt.\n\u201cTell me you want this,\u201d Derek says against his skin and Stiles feels his toes curl at Derek\u2019s lips against his neck.\n\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cThen hell yeah, you know I do.\u201d\nDerek makes a noise in the back of his throat before hauling him up, hands burning as they grip Stiles\u2019 hips and leaving hot brands against the bone. Stiles has one hand in Derek\u2019s hair, tugging on it and the other trails up his back and under his shirt. Derek cups his face and tilts it so he can bite at his chin before kissing him deeply again, sucking on his tongue and then biting at his lower lip.\n\u201cGod, always knew you\u2019d be ridiculous in the bedroom,\u201d Stiles mutters as Derek drops his head to run his tongue around one of his nipples.\nDerek bites down on the nub and then looks up at him. \u201cYou thought about this?\u201d he asks hoarsely.\n\u201cMmmm,\u201d Stiles shifts so that he\u2019s sitting on the desk; shoving away the brochures and notepad laid out for guest use and wrapping his legs around Derek\u2019s waist, pulling him close again. \u201cAll the way through from tenth grade. You never did?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say that,\u201d Derek murmurs easily, helping Stiles rid him of his own shirt and seeming to shiver slightly as Stiles runs his hands along broad shoulders and then trails them down his arms. He leans in and noses at Stiles neck. \u201cThought about waiting till you were in a detention by yourself and fucking you across one of the desks quite a lot.\u201d\nStiles groans, bites down on his bottom lip. \u201cYou did not.\u201d\n\u201cAnd, in various places on school property that would have gotten me shot by your dad.\u201d\n\u201cI was sixteen!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, and you were mouthy back then, too.\u201d Derek drops to knees in front of Stiles and Stiles groans, tips his head back. He cannot watch this happen. He won\u2019t last ten seconds.\nDerek\u2019s hands slide up his legs, curling over his knees and then pushing his thighs apart.\n\u201cThought about fucking you in that red suit of yours last year, pretty much any time I saw you, really.\u201d He looks up at Stiles through his lashes as he leans forward and licks a slow strip up the outline of Stiles\u2019 cock against his boxer briefs. \u201cThought about what you\u2019d taste like.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2014you totally did not give off an impression implying that when we were reunited this afternoon.\u201d\n\u201cYou caught me off guard,\u201d Derek says huskily, biting at the elastic band of his underwear and letting it go with a snap. \u201cI\u2019m better at admiring from afar.\u201d\nStiles wheezes out a laugh as Derek skims his fingers round his back, pulling him to the edge of the desk and then making him lift his hips to help remove his boxers. \u201cBetter that way with me anyway. From far away I\u2019m okay, but up close way too much.\u201d\nDerek\u2019s breath ghosts over his cock as it springs free finally and he hums, presses a kiss to the tip. \u201cI prefer you close up. Thought about fucking you in the goddamn airport bathroom earlier too.\u201d\n\u201cChrist, why didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cI told you,\u201d Derek bites at his inner thigh as he wraps a hand around the base of Stiles\u2019 cock and uses the other one to draw indistinct patterns across his hip bone. \u201cI\u2019m socially awkward,\u201d he says before sucking Stiles into his mouth.\nStiles\u2019 laugh dies in his throat and he shoves a fist in his mouth and grabs at Derek shoulder with the other. \u201cNng fuck, Derek.\u201d\nDerek pulls off with an obscene sounding pop and flashes a grin at him. \u201cLater.\u201d Before he ducks his head back down, pushing his tongue into the slit of his cock and then stretching his lips around him and drawing him back into his mouth. Stiles can feel his orgasm building in the base of his spine, it feels like his skin\u2019s been on fire for hours, like he\u2019s been on edge and zinging with every touch, every breathless moment and he cracks his eyes open to watch Derek\u2019s dark head slowly bob up and down in time with the swirling of his tongue.\nThe guy knows how to give really good head.\nHe grabs at Derek\u2019s hair and then lets go again thinking it might not be polite, but Derek growls around his cock, the vibrations shooting right through him and lifts a hand to place his own back where they were. Then he opens his mouth wider, relaxes his jaw and looks up at Stiles expectantly. Stiles swallows a gasp and lifts an eyebrow. \u201cYou sure?\u201d\nDerek rolls his eyes and slides forward again and Stiles can\u2019t help but lift his hips up and slam into that hot, wet, perfect mouth now he has permission. He tangles his fingers in soft hair and bites his lip to keep from shouting out and Derek just fucking takes it. Eyes fixed on him as Stiles\u2019 cock slips in and out of his mouth. Stiles wants to savour the memory forever because this is once in a lifetime, this is unthinkable. And then suddenly he\u2019s seizing up, can feel his toes curling and sparks of pleasure shooting all around him and he knows he\u2019s going to come, tugs on Derek\u2019s hair to warn him but Derek doesn\u2019t move, shoulders stubborn against his hands as he pushes the tip of one finger further back and teases against his hole. Stiles cries out and stills before coming right down Derek\u2019s throat. The pleasure\u2019s so bright it\u2019s almost painful and he scrunches up his eyes, mouth wide in a silent oh as his limbs give out on him and he flops back against the wall.\nDerek stands slowly; shedding his pants and Stiles makes grabby hands at him. \u201cJust gimme two seconds and I\u2019ll help.\u201d\nDerek grins and leans in to kiss him, slow and sweet and a total contrast to the Derek who was so determined to suck his brains out through his dick a minute ago. Stiles arches into it, hands skimming across Derek\u2019s abs and then lower, slipping under his boxers and clutching at his ass. Derek moans and sucks in a breath, hips rocketing forward to jerk against Stiles\u2019 own.\nStiles pushes the underwear out of the way, watches Derek step out of them, completely at ease. Stiles knows he's staring, but he can't help himself.\u00a0He'd\u00a0been so busy being attacked by Derek\u2019s mouth he hadn\u2019t really taken in how gloriously fit Derek is. He should have guessed considering the handstands and the shoulders and the fact Derek was obsessed with weight training when they were still in high school but still. He makes an appreciative sound as he splays his hands out round Derek\u2019s muscled thighs, pulls him in and lowers his mouth to kiss across Derek\u2019s chest. Derek drops his head back and Stiles uses the opportunity to lick at the base of his throat the way he\u2019s wanted to all day. Derek tastes like sweat and earth and a little like you only ever can when you\u2019re travelling. But, he still tastes good and Stiles... really wants to taste him all over.\n\u201cYou\u2019re ridiculous,\u201d he says faintly.\nDerek hums and finds his mouth again, \u201cYou\u2019re incredible,\u201d he murmurs against Stiles lips before kissing him soundly.\nStiles smiles against it before yelping when Derek suddenly slides his hands under his ass and carries him the short distance from the desk to the bed.\n\u201cWarn a guy next time, sheesh!\u201d\n\u201cI like the element of surprise.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but mmff\u2014\u201d Derek doesn\u2019t let him finish as he kisses him again. Stiles likes kissing, he really does. It always seems like guys aren\u2019t supposed to enjoy it but it\u2019s honestly more intimate and personal to him than almost anything else. You don\u2019t have to kiss someone to fuck them. You don\u2019t have to kiss someone to let them cop a feel or drop to their knees in a bathroom stall. Kissing is honest, up close and personal, you learn a lot from the way someone kisses you. Derek kisses like he seems to do everything else, all intense and passionate, and utterly focused on Stiles. It makes him feel breathless and heady and it makes him want it all the time.\nHe stretches and enjoys the way Derek\u2019s body fits against his, the weight of Derek pressing him into the mattress and the feel of their legs tangling together.\nDerek lifts his head up and looks down at him suddenly, \u201cDo you ever stop thinking?\u201d\n\u201cWhat, me?\u201d\n\u201cI can hear your brain.\u201d\n\u201cNow that would be talent, man. Plus, it would have saved us a whole lot of trouble in the airport, we could have played strip poker and I could\u2019ve gotten you naked like, three hours faster.\u201d\nDerek grins, \u201cOr, I could have gotten you naked and scarred the whole airport.\u201d\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve established that you\u2019re lying when you imply you think I\u2019m not all kinds of sexy, dude,\u201d he says easily, scraping his nails against the base of Derek\u2019s skull and then digging them into his shoulders. \u201cYou totally wanted a piece of this all along.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I did,\u201d Derek says softly and there\u2019s a seriousness in his tone to match the fierce expression in his eyes.\nStiles grinds up into him and smiles, nips at his jawline. \u201cThen get it already, we don\u2019t have all night.\u201d\n\u201cActually,\u201d Derek takes both his hands and pushes them up over their heads to twine them at the headboard. \u201cSeeing as there\u2019s snow still falling I think we might.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever will we do with ourselves?\u201d\n\u201cCould watch a movie if you like,\u201d Derek suggests, leaving one of his hands wrapped around Stiles\u2019, pinning them tightly and trailing the other one down his side. \u201cOr sleep? You mentioned needing some zzs, I believe?\u201d\n\u201cI could sleep,\u201d Stiles replies, letting his legs fall open even as they\u2019re talking. Derek makes a pleased noise as he strokes his hand over Stiles\u2019 balls and then traces circles round Stiles\u2019 hole. Stiles keens, rocking into it. \u201cOhm okay,\u00a0no sleeping.\u201d\n\u201cSure? You do look a little worn out.\u201d\n\u201cOh, fuck you.\u201d\n\u201cSome other time,\u201d and then Derek\u2019s rolling away from him completely and Stiles is watching him go in surprise.\n\u201cUh, what. Come back here.\u201d\nDerek\u2019s digging through his carry-on bag and then scowling at it. Stiles stares at Derek\u2019s ass because, well, he can.\n\u201cYou get a sudden urge to go trekking through the snow or something?\u201d\nDerek glances at him over his shoulder and oh, that look is smouldering. \u201cI don\u2019t carry lube around, particularly when I\u2019m going through airport security. Do you?\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Stiles\u2019 face falls. \u201cNo, I guess not. Just use whatever they\u2019ve got in the bathroom.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014no?\u201d\n\u201cDerek,\u201d he whines before shuffling down the bed and wrapping a hand around his cock. \u201cI will do this by myself if you don\u2019t get back here soon; fuck the fancy stuff, if it\u2019s not spit I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll live.\u201d Derek\u2019s eyes are following his hand twisting slowly on his cock and he nods, hypnotized.\n\u201cRight, okay.\u201d\n\u201cDerek,\u201d Stiles snaps his fingers and it earns him a fully-fledged growl before Derek stalks into the bathroom and throws a tie at Stiles\u2019 head.\n\u201cI really don\u2019t remember you being this bossy in high school,\u201d he complains as he drops back onto the bed and Stiles immediately clambers on top of him, straddling his legs.\n\u201cThat\u2019s probably because your memories of me are shaded with adoration and confusion and dirty fantasies. The real version of me was bossy as hell,\u201d Stiles squeezes lotion out onto his fingers and sits up slightly, Derek\u2019s fingers gripping at his waist. \u201cStill am,\u201d he gasps out as he tests out pushing in one finger carefully. Derek\u2019s holding him up off his thighs and staring at where Stiles\u2019 finger is disappearing into his body with utter fascination.\n\u201cOh fuck,\u201d Stiles groans, eyes fluttering closed. It\u2019s uncomfortable as hell and he can feel his thighs begin to protest.\nIn one swift movement Derek\u2019s flipping them, spreading Stiles\u2019 legs again and sliding his own hand down to join his own. \u201cYou okay?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles moans when Derek\u2019s other hand runs across his chest and then curls around his dick. \u201cIt\u2019s just been a while.\u201d\n\u201cHow much of a while?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014 uh\u2014I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cStiles.\u201d\n\u201cLike a year, eighteen months? I don\u2019t really screw around.\u201d\nDerek makes a noise in the back of his throat and slowly he dips his head to suck a bruise into the juncture where his neck meets his shoulder.\nStiles keeps his eyes open, focused on the way Derek\u2019s hair is slick with sweat, falling gently onto his forehead in places, the way his eyelashes sweep against his cheekbones as he looks down between them, his whole body tense with concentration.\nIt starts to feel good around the time Derek adds a second finger and crooks in just the right way and Stiles sees stars. \u201cOh, yeah, there, do that again.\u201d\n\u201cHave you got\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles bats at Derek\u2019s chest and Derek lets him sit up. He hops off the bed and grabs his bag. \u201cIt\u2019s for like, emergencies,\u201d he says when he pulls out his one and only condom. He\u2019s had it about five months\u00a0but hey, it\u2019ll still work.\nDerek slips out of bed and runs his hands across Stiles\u2019 ribs, \u201cCould just do it here.\u201d\nStiles pushes out a hand to lean against the wall,\u00a0can't help but whine as Derek slots up behinds him, hard cock just brushing against his entrance.\n\u201cReally rather watch the show if I\u2019m honest.\u201d\nDerek growls and bites against the back of his neck before spinning him and pressing him up against the door again. It seems to be a thing for him.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to be the death of me.\u201d\n\u201cNot a bad way to go.\u201d\n\u201cProbably not the worst way I could think of.\u201d\nStiles laughs and Derek swallows it down, pulling him back towards the bed and rolling them so that he\u2019s completely covering Stiles.\n\u201cGod, damn,\u201d Stiles groans out as Derek wraps a hand back around his cock and jerks it slowly. Stiles has never been so hard in his life, never been so desperately in need of someone and he really, really wants Derek to fuck him into the mattress.\nDerek bites down on his shoulder and Stiles realises he said that last part out loud.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d he says crossly. \u201cI just gave you an actual written invitation, you want it in blood, too?\u201d\n\u201cGross,\u201d Derek wrinkles his nose up, \u201cYou\u2019re so bossy, seriously.\u201d\nHe\u00a0pulls at Stiles\u2019 legs, wrapping them around his waist and then lining himself up.\n\u201cPlease, you like it, ohh,\u201d Stiles digs his fingers into Derek\u2019s arms as he feels Derek sink into him achingly slowly, before bottoming out and going still.\n\u201cOh, god.\u201d\nDerek\u2019s biting his bottom lip, eyes scrunched up as he shifts his hips experimentally. Stiles feels his cock twitch against his stomach, something about how fucking intimate this all is getting to him more than anything else. He runs a hand across Derek\u2019s jaw and Derek leans into it and then opens his eyes. Stiles is blown away by how intense they are and he stretches up to kiss him, once, twice, before dropping back on the bed and reaching for the headboard, grinning.\n\u201cCome on, I\u2019m all in Hale, bets are off, fuck me.\u201d\nDerek arches an eyebrow at him and then pulls almost all the way out before slamming back in and oh yeah, fuck, this is going to be sweet.\nStiles rocks his hips up to meet Derek\u2019s thrusts, letting out a string of curses as Derek fucking pounds into him. He sets up an almost reckless rhythm, driving into Stiles like he\u2019s on a mission and Stiles is all for it, really he is. Derek twists his hips suddenly and hits gold as Stiles sees bright, white, light behind his eyes and lets out a shout.\n\u201cShit, yeah, there, Derek.\u201d\nHe digs his heels into Derek\u2019s back, urging him on. His hands are slipping in the sweat on Derek\u2019s shoulder blade and he reaches up to tug Derek close so he can mash their lips together, kissing him with bruising force.\n\u201cNo idea how long I have wanted to do this for,\u201d Derek mutters, pressing his forehead against Stiles cheek and when they pull apart, both of them breathless with exertion.\n\u201cThink you already, oh, made that pretty clear.\u201d\n\u201cYou just have no idea how hot you are, do you?\u201d\n\u201cMe? Have you looked in the mirror lately?\u201d\nDerek hunches up his shoulders in a shrug before sliding a slick hand between them and pulling on Stiles\u2019 cock. \u201cGot nothing on you.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2014 are on very different pages there, my friend,\u201d Stiles gasps out.\n\u201cI like my page, view\u2019s good,\u201d Derek pushes himself up on one hand so he can sink into him at a better angle and Stiles whines again. It's just so good.\n\u201cHow are you still forming words?\u201d\n\u201cYou are too, must be\u2014doing something wrong,\u201d Derek\u2019s pace is relentless, hammering into him wildly and Stiles laughs, barely able to hold on.\n\u201cNo, trust me, all well. Oh god, god, god.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s Derek.\u201d\n\u201cOh ha, like no-one has ever used that joke before ever.\u201d\nDerek rolls his eyes and then twists his wrist at the same time as he\u2019s pushing into Stiles. The head board slams against the wall and Stiles allows himself a second of glee to tick that particular box on his checklist before Derek\u2019s licking at his adam\u2019s apple, and then over the bruise he made earlier. He clamps his teeth around it and Stiles\u2019 orgasm slams through him so hard he\u2019s caught off guard. He yells in shock and he feels his whole body fizzing with it, waves of endless pleasure sparking through him.\nDerek makes a pleased noise and then pulls Stiles into his lap, fucking up into him with total abandon. Stiles wraps his arms around his neck, clinging on, too wrung out to do anything but mutter encouragement and pepper any skin within reach with kisses. Derek tips his face up to look at him and Stiles leans down, pulls at his lower lip with his teeth before mouthing against his ear.\n\u201cCome on Derek, just fucking do it, fucking come.\u201d\n\u201cSo\u2014bossy,\u201d Derek groans before stilling and then letting out a noise more animal than anything else and biting down on Stiles\u2019 shoulder as he comes.\nStiles falls back against the sheets, legs still wrapped tight around Derek so that he collapses on top of him. For a minute they\u2019re quiet, Derek\u2019s running his hands along Stiles\u2019 sides and Stiles sighs happily, eyes dropping.\n\u201cIt should totally snow more often,\u201d he says drowsily.\nHe feels Derek\u2019s grin against his neck before he pulls out slowly.\n\u201cShould shower.\u201d\n\u201cNah,\u201d Stiles rolls over and grabs at a stray pillow, yanking off the pillowcase and using it to wipe himself down. \u201cDo it the morning.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re gross,\u201d Derek says, even as his arm is sliding round Stiles\u2019 middle, pulling him close.\nStiles flicks his nose. \u201cAnd you just had the best sex ever courtesy of me so shut up.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know if it was the best sex ever\u2014\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI think we could beat it tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re on.\n*\nStiles groans when his phone starts buzzing at an ungodly hour of the morning. Derek\u2019s face is buried in his neck and his arm tightens around his waist but otherwise he doesn\u2019t move.\nHe twists as much as he can and fumbles to find his phone. Derek sighs and reaches over to his side of the bed and shoves the phone in his face. \u201cYour people are up too early.\u201d\n\u201cTell me about it,\u201d Stiles grumbles, sinking back down into the covers and settling against Derek\u2019s shoulder as he flips his cell open. \u201c\u2019Lo?\u201d\n\n\u201cStiles! The damn airline have been trying to get in touch with your room for half an hour\u2014your flight goes out in forty minutes!\u201d\n\nHe jerks up and looks around the room to where the motel phone is on the floor amongst the things that fell via their destruction of the desk last night. It\u2019s off the hook.\n\u201cOh my god, Derek,\u201d he yells as he falls out of bed. \u201cDerek, our flight is leaving!\u201d He hangs up on Danny calling him a moron and looks around the room for his shirt.\nDerek\u2019s up and searching for his pants in seconds. Stiles takes a second to appreciate his bed hair and silently mourn the fact Derek is putting clothes on instead of walking around naked all the time. Forever. In Stiles\u2019 bedroom.\nSex with Derek clearly makes him a little stupid because this was a weird one night stand between old acquaintances right?\n\u201cStiles, you\u2019re not putting on any clothes which, though I appreciate the view, they won\u2019t let you on the plane like that.\u201d\nStiles snaps to and yanks on his shirt. \u201cDo you know where my tie is?\u201d\nDerek\u2019s eyes dart around and then he drops to the floor and pulls the tie from under the bed. He wraps around Stiles\u2019 neck, tying it easily and Stiles tries not to think about how familiar the gesture is, how much he could get used to it and tries to savour it for what it is.\nThen Derek hands him his glasses and yanks open the door. \u201cCome on, there\u2019s no way I\u2019m sitting next to that crying kid from yesterday.\u201d\n\u201cYour compassion knows no bounds,\u201d Stiles retorts drily.\n\u201cI can\u2019t feel you up under those stupid tiny flight blankets when there are kids around, Stiles.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d\nStiles stops in the doorway and Derek turns in the corridor to look at him impatiently. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou want\u2014I didn\u2019t know if\u2014\u201d\nDerek hesitates, knuckles suddenly going white where he\u2019s gripping his bag. \u201cYou don\u2019t\u2014 I thought maybe\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo I do! I mean I think I do? If you\u2019re asking what I think you\u2019re asking?\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d\nStiles huffs and grabs for Derek\u2019s hand. \u201cCome on, we can be emotionally constipated on the plane. Then you can feel me up.\u201d\nDerek\u2019s smile is sudden and blinding and then they\u2019re making out in the motel hallway.\nThey end up with ten minutes to leg it back through the airport.\n*\nNo one can ever say with all honesty that giving a blow job in a plane bathroom is easy. It\u2019s nearly impossible. Stiles would have given up in thirty seconds if Derek\u2019s hands hadn\u2019t been flexing in his hair and he hadn\u2019t been making the most profound noises.\nAs he falls asleep on Derek\u2019s shoulder Stiles decides getting god knows what on his pants was worth it.\n*\n\u201cSo.\u201d They\u2019re standing at the doors to Beacon Hills airport and twenty fours ago Stiles would have been all kinds of excited to be home, now he sort of feels like he has a lead weight in his stomach.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Derek echoes, hands deep in his pockets. He looks absolutely\u00a0debauched with his hair everywhere, a bite-mark that matches Stiles teeth peeking out from his shirt collar and his suit loose and dirty.\u00a0 Stiles probably doesn\u2019t look any better seeing as Derek has stubble and rubbed it all over his face last night.\n\u201cYou uh, I mean,\u201d Stiles chews on his lip, Derek tracks the movement but doesn\u2019t close the distance between them like Stiles wants him to. \u201cYou need a ride? Scott\u2019s picking me up.\u201d\nDerek smiles, slow and almost wistful. \u201cNah, my sister\u2019ll be here eventually.\u201d\n\u201cOkay well, it was nice seeing you again?\u201d Derek raises his eyebrows at him and Stiles rolls his eyes. \u201cOkay okay! It was fucking ridiculous and surreal and awesome. Better?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, ditto,\u201d Derek says teasingly, but\u00a0his lips are curving up\u00a0into one of those beautiful, fond smiles Stiles is starting to adore.\u00a0\u201cStiles\u2014\u201d\n\u201cStiles!\u201d Scott bursts in through the automatic doors and throws himself into Stiles. \u201cYou made it! Dude, we were so worried!\u201d\nStiles laughs, pats his friend on the back and takes a second to breathe him in, everything about him familiar and homelike. He turns to re-introduce Scott to Derek, grinning as he thinks of Derek\u2019s reaction to the kid who was convinced his baby was gonna be the next Jesus, and Derek\u2019s gone. Just fucking vanished.\nStiles does not want to find him and kick his ass; he is totally above being ditched at the airport and then pouting about it. Besides it\u2019s not like he and Derek were going home together, why would he even bother waiting around?\nHe lets Scott talk about excitedly about the baby all the way home and it\u2019s nice, it\u2019s all so nice. The scenery hasn\u2019t changed, Scott\u2019s stupid, terrible old Volvo hasn\u2019t changed and his dad hasn\u2019t changed as he comes out of the house, appraising Stiles as he does so.\n\u201cSon.\u201d\n\u201c\u2019Sup dad.\u201d\n\u201cYou get in a wrestling match with a thorn bush?\u201d\nStiles claps both his hands to his scratched up cheeks and laughs awkwardly, \u201cLong story.\u201d\nThe Sheriff hums and then ushers them both inside for lunch.\n*\nStiles spends the rest of Christmas Eve trying and failing not to think about Derek and trying but succeeding to avoid Danny\u2019s calls.\nErica knocks on the door around five and jabs a hand at the hickey on his neck the second she opens it. \u201cThis is why you weren\u2019t answering your phone to Danny? He\u2019s going nuts, you know.\u201d\n\u201cI fell,\u201d he says, scowling and slapping a hand over the mark. For some reason he wants to keep it private, it\u2019s something between himself and Derek and, whatever they were.\nErica smirks at him and then tosses her hair. \u201cSo, home again. Fabulous.\u201d She shoves her bag at him and then leans up to kiss his cheek. \u201cYou look tired.\u201d\n\u201cI always look tired,\u201d he grouses and then waves her bag at her. \u201cAnd, when did I agree to carry this?\u201d\n\u201cHoney, you will always be the number one man in my life, therefore, you will always have to carry my bags.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2026 does not seem fair at all.\u201d\n\u201cToo bad I couldn\u2019t like dick, right?\u201d\n\u201cHow you get away with talking so obscenely to your boss is a miracle.\u201d\n\u201cGood thing you\u2019re my boss,\u201d she says with a wicked grin as she sashays into the house and up to the spare room. It\u2019s pretty much officially her room these days.\n\u201cNa uh, you\u2019re fired!\u201d\n*\nOn Christmas Day he and his dad don\u2019t move from the sofa except to get more turkey and watch all three Lord Of The Rings movies. It\u2019s tradition. Erica reluctantly goes to see her parents for the day then she and Stiles get blindingly drunk and fall asleep on the floor. The Sheriff takes a photograph and sets it as his background screensaver; Lydia taught him how the last time she was home.\nIt\u2019s not exactly what you\u2019d call a classic Christmas special but it works for them and when Stiles wakes up dry mouthed and uncomfortable with Erica\u2019s hair in his mouth he feels better than he has in months.\nHe spends an hour staring at Derek\u2019s Facebook page (he has one photograph; eight friends; and one notification announcing Derek Hale has no idea why he has this stupid thing, liked by Laura Hale and someone called Isaac Lahey he vaguely remembers from Derek\u2019s year at school). Then like the dork he is, he saves the photograph into a folder Erica will never take a second glance at and shuts his computer. It\u2019s a nice photograph as well, one someone\u2019s clearly taken of Derek caught off guard and almost smiling as he sits at a table for what looks like a wedding with his shirt un-tucked and his tie loosened, eyes straight to the camera.\nStiles knows how those eyes look approximately three centimetres from his face and it\u2019s not fair he doesn\u2019t have photographic evidence of them. Stupid magic eyes.\nHe wants to talk to Derek more than anything which feels, completely ridiculous, seeing as before yesterday he hadn\u2019t spoken to the guy in over five years but still, he really sort of misses him.\n*\n\u00a0\n\u201cI got it,\u201d Stiles hollers as he jogs down to answer the doorbell that's just rung. He yanks open the door grinning and then feels him mouth drop open when he sees Derek surrounded by his family and the McCalls.\n\u201cDerek!\u201d\n\u201cStiles,\u201d he says smirking before stepping into the house and placing a bottle of expensive looking red wine into his hands and discreetly running a hand across his chest. \u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d he adds casually as he heads down the hall.\n\u201cStiles, honey!\u201d Melissa McCall kisses his cheek and then tugs at it. \u201cYou\u2019re not getting enough vitamin C; you\u2019re too pale.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2014just a little confused,\u201d he says slowly. \u201cI didn\u2019t know we were having so many guests over.\u201d\n\u201cOh, your father invited us last week,\u201d says Mrs Hale and oh god he was having sex with her son forty eight hours ago. Stiles flushes from head to toe just thinking about it and gives her what he hopes is a welcoming smile.\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t mention it! Fortunately we\u2019ve got a pretty big dining table.\u201d\n\u201cIs the food ready yet?\u201d Erica appears at the top of the stairs and there\u2019s a distinct sound of clattering from the living room as Derek re-appears and everyone at the door turns to stare up at Erica. Who is wearing a towel. And nothing else. In Stiles\u2019 house.\nDerek looks, well, he looks kind of pissed off which Stiles can\u2019t help but find quite nice because even though they haven\u2019t said anything about becoming a something or whatever it\u2019s always good to know someone\u2019s getting jealous over you.\nIt might actually be a first for Stiles. He thinks back and tries to decide if Scott and his dog Casper wrestling with each other for Stiles\u2019 attention counts.\nThe glare Derek\u2019s levelling in Erica\u2019s direction is way better than the one Scott sent his triumphant puppy and Stiles decides this one definitely counts.\n\u201cErica!\u201d He exclaims finally. \u201cYou showered.\u201d\n\u201cDuh,\u201d she says rolling her eyes before disappearing again.\n\u201cHonestly,\u201d he says laughing awkwardly but not finding any other words as the whole party turn to look at him. \u201cThis could actually not get any worse,\u201d he mutters under his breath and flees to the dining room.\nHe gets about three seconds of panicking done before Derek appears at the dining room door and slowly pushes it to, \u201cYou need any help?\u201d he asks curtly.\n\u201cShe\u2019s not my girlfriend,\u201d Stiles blurts out.\nDerek looks surprised and then marginally relieved before schooling his expression into a neutral one again, \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\u201cLook. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re thinking or feeling or even like, I don\u2019t know maybe you have a girlfriend or a boyfriend, or both! Hey, no judgement. But I kind of don\u2019t want you to think I have one? Like, I\u2019m not a hundred per cent on why, but I think I don\u2019t want you to think I\u2019m that kind of guy? And I\u2019m also still sort of replaying that whole night in my head over and over and really it\u2019s the kind of tape you don\u2019t ever want to lose and\u2014\u201d\nDerek\u2019s getting closer and closer to him and then he\u2019s pulling the wine Stiles is still clutching from his hands and placing it on the table before backing him up against the liquor cabinet and kissing the hell out of him.\nStiles sighs into it contentedly, fingers clutching at the leather jacket Derek\u2019s swapped in for his suit one; he would complain about how unfair it is that apparently nothing looks bad on Derek but really, he\u2019s not feeling put out here.\nDerek chest rumbles against his own as he groans and presses closer, hands almost desperate as they search for skin beneath Stiles\u2019 sweater.\n\u201cGod,\u201d Stiles breathes out and Derek ducks his head to seek out a bruise he left at the base of Stiles\u2019 throat and sucks on it. The zing of pain makes him shudder and winds his arms around Derek\u2019s neck, shifting his hips to push against Derek\u2019s.\n\u201c\u2014Yeah, I think they\u2019re in here I\u2019ll just\u2014\u201d Erica swings open the door and smirks when they slowly turn towards her, still tangled together. \u201cOh,\u201d she kinks an eyebrow at Derek. \u201cYou\u2019re either very charming or Stiles has been keeping me in the dark about something.\u201d\n\u201cGo away,\u201d Stiles says crossly.\n\u201cCan\u2019t,\u201d she shoots back. \u201cDanny and Lydia are on their way, your dad\u2019s deputies just arrived and twenty five people are going to be eating round that table in two minutes, including your dad.\u201d She pauses before she leaves and flicks her brown eyes over Derek. Derek actually leans back into Stiles and Stiles hides his grin.\n\u201cErica.\u201d\n\u201cFine, hurt him and die,\u201d she adds before darting out the door.\nStiles buries his face in his hands. \u201cOh my god, I\u2019m sorry. This is a nightmare. Why did you agree to come? You have to have better things to be doing on the day after Christmas than spending it here.\u201d\n\u201cNope,\u201d Derek says softly adjusting his sweater for him.\n\u201cYou\u2019re nuts.\u201d\n\u201cApparently,\u201d Derek replies drily before kissing him briefly and leaving the room.\nLydia and Danny fly in the front door seconds later, both with phones attached to their ears and looking stressed. Stiles internally winces wondering if he gives off that vibe every day. They\u2019re twenty five years old, Lydia\u2019s getting married in the spring and Danny\u2019s not at home enough to walk his own dog, this isn\u2019t the life he thinks they all want.\nHe wants it to change but he doesn\u2019t know how to tell them everything they\u2019ve worked for is nothing to him anymore. He still loves what they created but, he has way too much money to know what to do with and no time to come home and eat a Christmas lunch without someone emailing him about numbers.\nDinner is loud and messy with the Sheriff at the head of the table smiling fondly at everyone. Traditionally, they invite over the McCalls, some of the Sheriff\u2019s department, and apparently anyone else his father takes a fancy to, the day after Christmas to eat turkey sandwiches and cold piles of leftover vegetables.\nDerek hooks his foot around Stiles\u2019 ankle and they spend most of the evening playing footsie. He feels sixteen again.\nScott barely takes his eyes off Allison and they leave fairly soon after dinner, Allison apologetic but sleepy. Mrs McCall stays to open a bottle of Port with his dad, Deputy Saldana, Deputy Cage and Mrs Hale.\nDanny falls asleep in the armchair he\u2019s always claimed as his own, seconds after sitting down in it and even Lydia seems disinclined to check her phone for messages by the time they\u2019ve finished swapping presents. She keeps glancing down at her engagement ring and flushes pink every time someone comments on it. Laura Hale, terrifying, knowing, eyes just a little too sharp when she looks at Stiles, asks about her fianc\u00e9e and Lydia\u2019s off talking about Boyd and his antique glass shop.\nStiles can\u2019t even remember how they met but he remembers a drunkenly slurred conversation where he warned the guy never to hurt Lydia or he\u2019d have him killed. He\u2019s still not sure if Boyd knows it was a joke. Well, he\u2019s pretty sure it was a joke. He does love his friends something fierce.\nDerek pushes his rook forward suddenly and Stiles is drawn back to the game of chess they\u2019re playing. \u201cCheckmate.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? No!\u201d Stiles stares down at the board in horror. \u201cYou cheated!\u201d\n\u201cAt chess?\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t looking.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Derek says, the firelight dancing in his eyes and making his whole face look warm and inviting. Stiles wants to lean over and kiss the hell out of him. He settles for peering down at the board, eyes sweeping over the pieces.\n\u201cI can save this.\u201d\n\u201cNo, you suck at chess, accept it and move on.\u201d\n\u201cNo uh, my granddad taught me how to beat someone in three moves, I rock at chess.\u201d\nDerek stands and stretches; Stiles watches his tee shirt pull against his stomach muscles and remembers how they taste.\n\u201cWe better get going,\u201d Derek says softly, eyes fixed on Stiles as he lifts his head from blatantly checking Derek out.\n\u201cYou gotta go already?\u201d He hadn\u2019t thought he\u2019d even have this time with Derek but it\u2019s still not enough; it feels like it\u2019s never going to be enough now.\nDerek nods, flipping his phone open. \u201cMy uncle wants us all home to announce his new prodigy.\u201d\nStiles swallows. \u201cYou mean now it\u2019s not you?\u201d\n\u201cYep.\u201d\n\u201cAre you\u2014\u201d Stiles wants to reach out and touch his arm and thinks better of it. \u201cI hope it goes okay,\u201d he says finally.\nDerek crooks a smile at him and then glances round the room, Lydia and Erica have disappeared\u2014presumably to talk about bridesmaids dresses; Danny\u2019s totally out and they\u2019re alone but for the fire. \u201cStiles\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cWhatever you\u2019re going to ask, just yes.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if I was going to ask you to do cartwheels all around your house?\u201d\n\u201cThen I would find it fitting to your previous strange and creative requests, but try my best?\u201d\nDerek\u2019s smile is wider this time, less rigid and more open. \u201cYou\u2019re so weird,\u201d he says fondly.\n\u201cSays the guy who just suggested I go do some cartwheels in the snow?\u201d\n\u201cStiles, just,\u201d Derek shoots a hand out and it clamps round his wrist. \u201cAre you free tomorrow?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014kind of? I have to go over some papers with Danny and I promised I\u2019d call the Chicago office and check in, I think that\u2019ll be most of the morning, but maybe after four?\u201d\nDerek lets out a breath and nods. \u201cYou wanna do something?\u201d\n\u201cLike a date?\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d Derek\u2019s eyes crinkle at the corner with his smile and then reels Stiles in to kiss him briefly. \u201cCall me.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t have your number?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you do.\u201d And then he\u2019s out of the room and Danny\u2019s blinking awake, swearing about the European stock exchange. Stiles is left standing by the fire, wondering about his whole damn life.\n*\nDerek\u2019s number is saved in his phone and when he texts Stiles back to confirm a meeting point his message tone is Derek\u2019s voice saying Stiles Stilinski is an idiot who can\u2019t do a handstand to save his life but gives really good head. Stiles changes it because he cannot have that going off in public, but it makes him grin for an hour and he texts Derek telling him he\u2019s a nerd.\nHe\u2019s late to meet Derek at the movies and though Derek doesn\u2019t seem to mind Stiles catches him shooting thoughtful looks his way all up the queue to buy tickets.\n\u201cSo who\u2019s your favourite Bond?\u201d he asks as they make their way inside the auditorium.\n\u201cDalton,\u201d Derek replies automatically.\n\u201cBullshit.\u201d\n\u201cMoore, duh. Who was yours?\u201d\n\u201cConnery, we\u2019re clearly doomed,\u201d Stiles says with a grin.\nDerek snorts and grabs the popcorn off him, eating a handful and then licking his fingers clean. Stiles watches him do it and then glares when he sees Derek smirking. \u201cReally? In the middle of the afternoon? In public? You have a problem, my friend.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t wanna miss any of the sugar.\u201d\nStiles digs into his ice cream and shoves the spoon against the inside of his cheek just to watch Derek\u2019s eyes widen.\n\u201cYeah, we\u2019re apparently fifteen now,\u201d he says when he pulls it back out with a pop.\n\u201cWorks for me,\u201d Derek replies before practically pulling him out of his seat to kiss him for half the movie.\nThey get asked to leave.\nStiles gets asked to leave the one and only movie theatre in Beacon Hills where all of the ushers know exactly who his father is.\n\u201cI hope you\u2019re happy,\u201d he mutters, adjusting his jeans as they head out into the evening.\nDerek pulls a face a sorry but not sorry face, practically vibrating with glee. \u201cYep. I can\u2019t help it if you\u2019re loud.\u201d\n\u201cMe? You\u2019re the one who was saying my name like a damn prayer in there.\u201d\n\u201cStiles,\u201d Derek\u2019s leaning him up against the wall outside the movie theatre and Stiles blinks across at him.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cCome home with me.\u201d\n\u201cIs your mom home?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but if you prefer we can go to your place where you dad will be.\u201d\n\u201cFuck, we really are sixteen again. Okay; yours it is.\u201d\nDerek looks relieved and Stiles wonders why the hell the guy was nervous. He\u2019s Stiles. He\u2019s unlikely to say no to anything Derek asks ever again. \u00a0\n\u201cI missed all this the first time round,\u201d he comments as Derek laces their hands together and walks them towards the car.\n\u201cAll what?\u201d\n\u201cDating, fooling around, getting kicked out of the movie theatre.\u201d\n\u201cI cannot believe you and Scott never did that.\u201d\n\u201cWe did try once, but he was terrible at French kissing so never again.\u201d\nDerek\u2019s grip tightens on his hand and Stiles laughs. \u201cI\u2019m messing\u00a0with you, dude, I have never put my tongue anywhere near Scott.\u201d\n\u201cThank god, and I meant the movie theatre part, dumbass.\u201d\n\u201cI know, stop looking like I kicked your puppy.\u201d\n\u201cYou stop,\u201d Derek mutters before swinging the passenger door open for him and stalking round to his side. Not before kissing him twice more.\n*\nScott calls at five in the morning and Stiles has really got to stop waking up in Derek\u2019s arms when he can\u2019t stay there. The guy\u2019s like a Christmas present Stiles wants to take forever to unwrap. With his tongue.\n\u201cYou okay, man?\u201d\n\u201cThe baby! Stiles, the baby\u2019s coming!\u201d\nHe shoots out of bed, grabbing the nearest shirt he can reach. \u201cOkay, okay, where are you?\u201d\n\u201cThe hospital, we just got here. Stiles, you have to come, now.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, dude, don\u2019t worry, relax, I\u2019m on my way.\u201d\nDerek rolls over, scrubbing a hand across his face. It's\u00a0adorable. Really, he should just be illegal with the adorableness and the sexiness and the smart, stupid goofy perfectness.\n\u201c\u2019S\u2019going on?\u201d\n\u201cAllison\u2019s baby, Derek, Allison\u2019s having her baby, shit, shit. I\u2019m gonna be an uncle.\u201d He stops and clutches at Derek\u2019s dresser, heaving in a breath. \u201cScott\u2019s gonna be a dad.\u201d\nIt\u2019s like it hasn\u2019t sunk in for the whole nine months. He hasn\u2019t been here to see it happening. He\u2019s barely touched Allison\u2019s growing bump, hasn\u2019t quizzed Scott on what he\u2019s been reading.\n\u201cOh my god, what if Scott accidentally sits on the baby, Derek? Shit, I haven\u2019t done anything to help him, shit, he sounded so freaked out. What the hell do I do?!\u201d\nDerek yanks on a shirt, and Stiles notices that it\u2019s his and that he\u2019s wearing Derek\u2019s which makes them both look kind of ridiculous, but he can\u2019t bring himself to care. Derek\u2019s shirt actually smells nice, like Derek and laundry detergent and it\u2019s soft against his hands.\n\u201cFirst, brush your teeth.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? No, I don\u2019t have time for that! I have to go to the hospital; dental hygiene can wait!\u201d\nDerek looks pointedly at the bed, and then back at Stiles and Stiles dashes into the en suite. \u201cDo you have a spare toothbrush?\u201d\n\u201cCabinet.\u201d\nHe scrubs at his teeth hurriedly and then darts back into the bedroom to find Derek wearing jeans and pulling on his jacket.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\nDerek rolls his eyes. \u201cYou are not quick in the mornings, are you, Stilinski? You don\u2019t have a car, here.\u201d\n\u201cOh, shit, fuck, right, you don\u2019t mind?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Derek says easily before leaning over to kiss him and shove him out of the bedroom. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky you\u2019re pretty.\u201d\n\u201cYou suck.\u201d\n\u201cClever.\u201d\n*\nChloe McCall is seven pounds six ounces and a perfect ball of pink fluff.\u00a0 Stiles can\u2019t stop taking pictures of her. His dad arrives at eleven, straight from work and beams, clapping Scott on the shoulder and kissing Allison\u2019s cheek. Melissa keeps bursting into tears but no one minds because Allison and Scott keep doing the same thing.\nAt one, Stiles\u2019 phone start getting irritating.\nBy three, he\u2019s got thirty missed calls and listened to four increasingly stressed sounding voicemails from Danny with a terse congratulations to be passed on to Scott and Allison when he realizes where Stiles must be.\nDerek\u2019s is the only text Stiles replies to all day and it\u2019s to gratefully agree to a ride home at five.\n\u201cDon\u2019t stay away for too long this time, man,\u201d Scott says as they pull apart when Stiles is getting ready to leave.\nStiles juts his chin at the baby in Allison\u2019s arms and grins. \u201cLike anyone could stop me.\u201d\nScott scrunches up his face and fixes him with a serious look. \u201cDude, I know this year\u2019s been crazy for us both, but actually I think a lot of things could stop you.\u201d\nStiles stares at him, arms hanging limply by his sides. \u201cI\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m trying,\u201d he says faintly, voice breaking suddenly and Scott smiles, pats his arm.\n\u201cI know you are bro\u2019, I just don\u2019t want you to feel like you\u2019re missing your life.\u201d\nTo most people Stiles already lives the life. He\u2019s got the cars, he\u2019s got the money, he\u2019s even got the fabulous blonde bombshell for his arm (though Erica would castrate him if she even thought he was thinking of trying to date her), she\u2019s still blonde and fabulous and on his side though. But to Scott, to his dad and to everyone here, the life is home, with his family, having dates with stupidly hot nerds who get up in the middle of the night to drive you to the hospital with no complaints.\nStiles is so fucking lost.\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell Danny to stop everything, man.\u201d\nScott shrugs. \u201cThen don\u2019t, just, come home more. You looked better this time, you know, like you\u2019ve been eating right or something. Did you take those vitamins my mom suggested?\u201d\nStiles can\u2019t help but grin at him and opens the door, blowing one last kiss to Allison. \u201cNah, it wasn\u2019t the vitamins.\u201d\nDerek\u2019s waiting for him in the parking lot, casually leaning against the car and Stiles feels his heart clench. He absolutely cannot be feeling that way yet. It\u2019s so dangerous. He\u2019s going to end up utterly heartbroken if he\u2019s not careful.\nHe smiles anyway, clamps down on the butterflies he gets when Derek smiles back and shows him a picture of the new baby.\n\u201cI hope she gets her mother\u2019s jawline,\u201d Derek says thoughtfully. Stiles barks out a laugh and punches him on the shoulder to defend his friend\u2019s honour. Derek hunches up his arm, full on grinning before pushing him up against the car and kissing him.\nApparently, Derek likes kissing Stiles as much as Stiles likes kissing Derek.\n\u201cSo, what are you doing next Tuesday,\u201d Derek asks when they pull apart.\n\u201cHmmm? Oh, I\u2019ll be in Detroit all week; we gotta get contractors in to look at the structure of the new office building and Erica\u2019s arranged interviews with the best in the area.\u201d\nDerek slowly drops his hands from where they\u2019re cupping Stiles\u2019 jaw. \u201cOh, yeah,\u201d he steps away. \u201cI forgot you had work.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be back after that!\u201d Stiles says brightly. \u201cNo, wait, no I have a\u2014\u201d\n\u201cStiles,\u201d Derek interrupts him, kisses his hand and then heads round to the driver\u2019s side. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\n*\nStiles does worry about it.\nHe worries about Derek finding someone else while he\u2019s gone. Someone who lives in the area and likes to read the news from a paper or someone who can actually walk on their hands. He worries about his dad\u2019s cholesterol and whether or not he\u2019s looking after himself.\nHe worries about Lydia trying to determine if her wedding dress will fit from online viewings and when the last time she saw Boyd was.\nHe worries about Danny and the way he looked ten years younger the second he was asleep in the grey squishy armchair.\nHe worries about Scott freaking out in the middle of the night when Chloe\u2019s a month old or two, and Allison\u2019s asleep and he won\u2019t want to wake her; and he\u2019s supposed to be able to call his best friend... But, Stiles is in Singapore and no use to him, thousands of miles away.\nHe worries he\u2019s not looking after his people the way he\u2019s supposed to.\nAt six am on the thirty first he climbs out of the window of his bedroom (so as not to wake his dad) and drives out to Derek\u2019s place.\nHe\u2019s supposed to be packing, but he never really bothered taking anything out of his suitcase in the first place. Erica\u2019s already taken a flight back to New York and Stiles is scheduled on one for later.\nDerek\u2019s sitting on the porch when he gets there, still wearing Stiles\u2019 shirt from earlier and reading a battered copy of The Fourth Hand. He looks up when he sees Stiles get out, pushes thick rimmed glasses not so different to Stiles\u2019 up his nose and stands.\n\u201cYou\u2019re out early.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t go to bed.\u201d Stiles barrels into Derek's chest suddenly, arms wrapping round him like an octopus. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing anymore.\u201d\nDerek\u2019s tense in his arms for a second, before slowly he places one hand at the nape of Stiles\u2019 neck and the other on his shoulders. \u201cYou know where I am when you come home,\u201d he says finally.\nStiles nods, and then straightens up, kisses him once, twice, like before. Derek\u2019s eyes soften like he remembers.\n\u201cSee you around,\u201d Stiles whispers. Even though he knows he won\u2019t. That Derek won\u2019t be at any more luncheons, that he missed his chance to see him at one and now he\u2019ll forever be looking and not seeing him. Derek won\u2019t be at any parties or around to drag him to the movies or play chess with him or anything.\nDerek\u2019s home now. And Stiles isn\u2019t. Stiles has been a fucking nomad since he was about seventeen. He doesn\u2019t know how to stop.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Derek says quietly. \u201cSee you.\u201d\n*\nHe gets one foot in the airport and shakes his head. \u201cNo.\u201d\nDanny pauses from shouting down the phone beside him and frowns. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cDude, look at us.\u201d\n\u201cStiles, what?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m twenty five and I\u2019ve seen more hotels than most people see in a lifetime. I spent more time on the phone to a dude in Hong Kong this year than I did with my best friend. I might possibly have just chosen to expand into something I don\u2019t want over awesome sex for the rest of my life. I won\u2019t know unless I have time to find out and I\u2014 need time! I can\u2019t do this.\u201d\nDanny snaps his phone shut and stares at him, wide eyed, \u201cYou don\u2019t want this?\u201d\n\u201cNo! Do you? Do you really want any more money, man? You never gave a shit about that before, we don\u2019t need it right?\u201d\n\u201cI know, Stiles, I thought this was what you wanted. I don\u2019t give a fuck if we go back to working out of your basement.\u201d\nStiles breaks out into a smile and claps him on the shoulder, \u201cI love you, man.\u201d\nDanny rolls his eyes but cuffs him round the neck fondly, \u201cYeah, same. Erica said she thought you might be having a change of heart soon, anyway,\u201d he adds with a smirk.\n\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014that girl is a liar and nothing she ever says is true.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s run your life for over five years, Stiles, I think she knows you pretty well. And I think she\u2019s right,\u201d Danny adds, squinting at him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t stop giving Derek Hale come fuck me eyes all through dinner last week.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2014beside the point! I did not have an existential crisis over Derek Hale and his impossible hotness, you know.\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t blame you,\u201d Danny says casually, adjusting his own bag. \u201cHe is pretty hot.\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t about Derek!\u201d His heart skitters in his chest when he suddenly realises Derek thinks he\u2019s just left, possibly for weeks, and it\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve.\n\u201cOh my god, what if he hooks up with someone else tonight?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI gotta go! I gotta\u2014shit, tell Erica I\u2019m sorry! Hey, hey!\u201d He skids outside and yells at the nearest cab. \u201cCan you get me back to Beacon Hills in twenty minutes?\u201d\nThe cab driver snorts and Stiles waves all the money he has in his wallet at him. \u201cYou can keep all the change.\u201d\nThey pull into town in fifteen and Stiles leaps from the cab. He has no fucking idea where Derek is.\nAs casually as he can he texts Derek wishing him a Happy New Year, avoids adding please don\u2019t have sex with anyone else before tomorrow and asks instead what he\u2019s up to.\nTo his surprise Derek calls him back. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be on a plane right now?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014I didn\u2019t get on the plane.\u201d\nDerek huffs. \u201cKind of defeats the purpose of flying somewhere.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not going, I mean, I\u2019m standing in the middle of town right now.\u201d\nHe hears Derek suck in a surprised breath. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t wanna go. I don\u2019t care about any of it, well I do, you know, I like my company. But I don\u2019t like that it\u2019s becoming less and less mine and I don\u2019t like that I might miss my god daughter growing up or my dad eating right or, or maybe going on stuff like dates with you.\u201d\nA car door slams and then the line is quiet for a second.\n\u201cDerek?\u201d\n\u201cStiles, what are you asking me?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know I mean, fuck, I really like you. You can be a total jerk but you\u2019re also stupidly fucking sweet, and no one else beats me at poker, man, I mean no one. And you like John Irving and you\u2019re adorable when you\u2019re sleepy Derek, like, all kinds of adorable. So I just thought maybe we could skip work for a while, I heard you\u2019re free anyway, and maybe take a break? Have a lot of awesome, mind blowing sex and\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\u201cOh, right... Okay then?\u201d\n\u201cStiles,\u201d he can hear Derek almost laughing. \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot but I don\u2019t walk on my hands for just anyone, you know.\u201d\n\u201cGod, was that your attempt at courtship?\u201d\n\u201cShut up, no, just. I really think you should come over tomorrow and I can tell you all the things I like about you, map some of them out with my tongue.\u201d\nStiles sets off at a jog through town because no, that is so happening tonight. \u00a0He could not feel like more of a crazy person, either. There are car horns beeping at him and he knows he looks insane but fuck it, it\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve, hopefully everybody looks insane and he\u2019s just blending in.\n\u201cWhere are you?\u201d\n\u201cGoing home, traffic\u2019s shit and I\u2019m stuck on main street, why?\u201d\n\u201cI told you, I came back into town and I\u2019m so not going home without you. How far down are you?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re stuck on main street, just tell me how far down you are. Are you closer to the bank or the sheriff\u2019s department.\u201d\n\u201cThe bank\u2014Stiles what are you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDerek!\u201d Stiles yells and weaves through traffic when he sees Derek\u2019s Camaro idling between a shitty old Civic and a green Comet.\nDerek gets out of the car, and he\u2019s wearing the same tie from the night in the airport and holding his phone to his ear looking all kinds of hot and confused. Stiles dodges a suddenly moving cab before practically vaulting himself into Derek\u2019s arms and kissing him.\nDerek drops his phone to catch him, one hand winding round his waist and the other grabbing at his hair, scraping against the back of his neck, clutching at him everywhere he can. The bells are going nuts from the church and people are cheering and there are fucking fireworks going off but Stiles doesn\u2019t care how clich\u00e9 it all is because when he pulls back to look at Derek he\u2019s smiling at Stiles fondly.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a fucking loon,\u201d he says.\n\u201cHappy New Year to you, too.\u201d\n\n*\nA year later, tanned and more relaxed than he\u2019s ever been in his life Stiles drops his canvas bag on the floor and tugs at the tie around his eyes. \u201cSeriously, Derek? I know where we are.\u201d\nDerek\u2019s hands slide round his waist, stroking up and down, \u201cThat\u2019s not the point.\u201d\n\u201cThe point is, you are secretly a romantic nerd.\u201d\n\u201cTakes one to know one.\u201d\n\u201cWho is also twelve years old.\u201d\n\u201cShut up,\u201d and then Derek\u2019s kissing him and Stiles reaches up to pull off the tie, tossing it on the ground and peeking round Derek\u2019s shoulder as Derek kisses behind his ear.\n\u201cOh, Derek.\u201d The motel room itself hasn\u2019t changed at all but Derek\u2019s obviously had someone change the sheets, light a bunch of candles and there\u2019s a pack of playing cards on the desk.\nStiles beams at him. \u201cYou\u2019re something sweet, you know that?\u201d\n\u201cMmmm,\u201d Derek pushes him towards the bed. \u201cSo are you, now take your pants off. Our flight home\u2019s in four hours.\u201d"
