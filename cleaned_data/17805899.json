    "text": "\n\n\"Raising me as a hero who could exceed All Might, just to fulfill his own ambitions. I hate it! Being no more than a tool for that human garbage.\u201d\n\n\n\nIzuku, sitting on the bed in his darkened room, solemnly contemplated what Todoroki had said at the Sports Festival a month ago. With the chaos of the Sports Festival, then the internships and subsequent fight with Stain, there had barely been enough hours in the day to get everything done, let alone think about what Todoroki had revealed to him. It chafed at Izuku, knowing that his friend was suffering and there wasn\u2019t anything he could do about it. He could tell All Might what Todoroki had said, but given that Todoroki had been \u201craised as a hero who could exceed All Might\u201d, that would be akin to mixing two different explosives and expecting them to cancel out. He could tell the police, but who would ever believe that Endeavor, the second highest ranking hero in all of Japan, was abusive? Especially considering Izuku had no evidence. If Todoroki himself went to the police, they might believe him, but he probably didn\u2019t want to tell all of his worst childhood memories to a stranger as a gamble. Even if everything went well and they were able to successfully accuse and possibly even convict Endeavor, that would cause a media scandal of epic proportions; Todoroki and his siblings and mother definitely wouldn\u2019t want their abuse story publicized on the news like a sordid affair.\n\n\nStill, as a hero, there was no way Izuku could ever possibly just stand back while his friend was suffering. Obviously, he couldn\u2019t legally take Endeavor to task, but he also wasn\u2019t strong enough to kick his ass. \n\nYet.\n\n The time it would take to become strong enough to beat the fear of God into Endeavor was too long.\n\n\nTheoretically, he could collect approximately eight milliliters of liquid nitroglycerin from Kacchan\u2019s gauntlets, freeze it into ice cubes, and put it in some sweet alcohol like rum (both to make the nitroglycerin work better because it would be diluted from the other components of Kacchan\u2019s sweat, and to mask the sweet and burning taste). From there, he could serve both Endeavor and himself drinks with ice cubes in them just in case Endeavor was paranoid enough to be wary of poison. If Izuku drank his fast enough that the ice cubes didn\u2019t have time to melt, he would be fine, whereas Endeavor, not knowing that he should knock it back, would drink it slowly. Endeavor most likely would not pass out and die from his heart slowing to the point of stopping until after leaving (given nitroglycerin\u2019s LD50 of two milliliters, but also the dilution), thereby giving Izuku plausible deniability.\n\n\nHowever, murder was wrong, so Izuku wasn\u2019t going to do that.\n\n\nEndeavor was already the subject of much controversy. Given his unappealing personality and penchant for destruction, hero fans were divided on whether or not to support him despite his personal achievements. It would be much easier to remove Endeavor from his position as a widely respected hero-- which he treasured over all else-- than to take him on legally or physically. But how?\n\n\nHis unappealing personality wasn\u2019t enough to bring him down. Perhaps the destruction rate? Hm, people care about their money, but destruction alone isn\u2019t enough to truly outrage people. Civilian injuries and casualties, maybe? That would impact people on a personal level. A sort of \u201cthat could be me\u201d response.\n\n\nInspired, Izuku leaped off his bed and booted up his computer. \u201cThe government\u2019s annual damage reports are the most reliable and have the most information, but they don\u2019t have the specific location of the incident, just the prefecture; they don\u2019t have the names of the heroes, villains, and vigilantes involved either\u2026\u201d He mumbled to himself. \u201cBut if I cross-reference a crisis mapping database of villain fights, I can match the date, time, and prefecture from the government records to the hero fights detailed in the database.\u201d\n\n\nHe spent half the night assimilating the government\u2019s annual damage report into his own spreadsheet, entering in all the heroes, villains, and vigilantes involved in each individual fight with gratuitous help from Professor Google. He used the \u201csort by\u201d tool several times to rank heroes by the totals of each category-- money lost in damages to public property, money lost in damages to private property, heroes injured while working in teams, heroes killed while working in teams, villains injured, villains killed, villains apprehended, civilians injured, and civilians killed.\n\n\nThe worst statistic on Endeavor\u2019s part was the money lost in damages to public property, but he was still ranked first in civilian casualties so Izuku set that as the default instead.\n\n\nIzuku had a thought: even with all this evidence that Endeavor was literal Satan and probably kicked puppies in his spare time (Izuku might have been going a little insane at this point), fans might dismiss the evidence claiming that this year could have just been a bad year for the #2 hero. Izuku sighed and cracked his knuckles. Plus ultra.\n\n\nSeveral hours later, he had not only added the information of several past years to his Spreadsheet of Doom but had also used Excel\u2019s chart function to generate a scatter plot of Endeavor\u2019s failings. The graph was linear with a positive slope, meaning that in future years Endeavor was likely to get even worse.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s not enough,\n\n Izuku\u2019s last two brain cells protested, so he also threw in an image of Endeavor\u2019s hero record. A hero record was a record that a hero could have, stating all their successful and unsuccessful missions, as well as the types of missions. While optional for most, the top ten heroes were required to release their hero record. Izuku highlighted the stats for fighting missions (which comprised most of Endeavor\u2019s record) and rescue missions (of which he had taken almost none).\n\n\nSaving the file with shaking hands, Izuku exulted in the completion of his masterpiece until realized he had no clue where to post this information. Sighing, he accessed the top ten hero forums and ran an algorithm to calculate the times of day that they got the most web traffic. As he was queueing The Spreadsheet to be posted on the next day, he realized he was being inconsiderate. Without a second thought, he picked up his phone and called Todoroki. After four rings, he picked up.\n\n\n\u201cMidoriya? It\u2019s half past four in the morning, what the hell do you want?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, is it really? I hadn\u2019t noticed. Anyway, if I told you I had a way to majorly fuck up your dad in the public eye, would you be okay with it?\u201d\n\n\nHe paused in shock that Izuku had sworn. \u201c...Yeah, sure, whatever. Go nuts.\u201d Todoroki hung up.\n\n\nNow with his friend\u2019s permission, Izuku gleefully scheduled his baby (as he had taken to calling The Spreadsheet) to post on the top ten hero forums at the time during which they would receive the maximum amount of exposure. Just to go the extra measure, he scheduled it on fifteen other websites because plus ultra and also he was very proud of his baby. \n\n\nAs soon as he finalized the last post, all the energy left him and he passed out on top of the covers of his bed at five in the morning. The alarm for his morning jog went off an hour later, and he slept through it. He slept through his mother making breakfast, and then lunch as well. Izuku finally woke up at four in the afternoon. Over a late lunch, he checked his phone to find a ridiculous amount of notifications, as well as several missed calls from Todoroki.\n\n\n\nWhoops,\n\n he thought. \n\nGuess I\u2019ll die then. \n\nHe hit the \u201ccall back\u201d button.\n\n\n\u201cMidoriya, what the fuck did you \n\ndo?\n\n\u201d Todoroki said in lieu of a greeting.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so so sorry I missed your calls, I was asleep because I stayed up super late!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, I guessed as much considering you called me at four in the morning.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAh, sorry!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBack to the point, \n\nwhat the fuck did you do?\n\n\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh no, I should have told you more, and you were tired so that probably didn\u2019t count as real permission, sorry so sorry!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cQuit apologizing. To be honest, I\u2019m not even mad, just confused. How did you manage to get every single person on the Internet to talk about how much they hate Endeavor overnight?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, uh\u2026 Your dad\u2019s a bitch.\u201d\n\n\nTodoroki snorted. \u201cUnderstatement of the year.\u201d\n\n\nIzuku laughed nervously. \u201cI haven\u2019t had the time to do anything until now, but as a hero-- or, well, a hero-in-training-- I couldn\u2019t just let him get away with being\u2026 Like That. But I would never tell anyone what you told me! It would be horrible of me to break that trust! So I went after him for something else.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWait, you mean \n\nyou\n\n wrote that document thing? How long have you been working on it? And why didn\u2019t you tell me about it?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI spent about ten hours straight making it yesterday,\u201d Izuku admitted.\n\n\nThe phone went silent. \u201cTodoroki? Are you still there?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to\u2026 do something else for a while. I think my brain needs to reboot.\u201d he hung up.\n\n\nAfter staring at the \u201ccall ended\u201d screen for a few moments, Izuku checked the myriad notifications he had received overnight, then choked on his food. Coughing, he stared at the numbers on his screen. Thirty thousand retweets on Twitter, forty thousand views on Reddit, and counting! \n\nHis baby was trending. \n\nThere were even news articles about it! His plan may have worked\u2026 a bit better than expected.\n\n\nIzuku\u2019s mother came home from the store to find her one and only son sitting at the kitchen table while staring into space. His day continued like that for the most part, functioning on autopilot, although he did manage to remain mostly sentient as Todoroki grilled him for details over the phone a few hours later. He went to bed early and barely remembered to set his alarm for school the next morning.\n\n\nWhen he woke up, he felt a little bit less like a zombie. However, the nervousness he felt the whole way to school was nearly overwhelming-- and righteously so, he thought as his homeroom teacher pulled him into an empty classroom before school had even started.\n\n\n\u201cI already talked to Todoroki,\u201d Aizawa said. \u201cJust\u2026 let me get this straight. You compiled massive amounts of data, performed numerous calculations, arranged them in exactly the right order to show just how bad Endeavor is, and then decided that wasn\u2019t enough and accessed his hero record too.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMhm,\u201d said Izuku, who was so nervous that he had looped right back around to being calm.\n\n\n\u201cThen you released this information to the public, calculating which popular forums and even the \n\nspecific time of day\n\n to post it at to get the most views.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYep.\u201d\n\n\nAizawa dragged his hand down his face. \u201cYou completely ruined this man's career and dragged his name through the mud. You did this to the \n\nnumber two hero\n\n. I thought you loved heroes?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe was a dick to me once and also I don\u2019t like the way he talks to Todoroki,\u201d Izuku blurted.\n\n\nAizawa stared at his Problem Child for several seconds. Softly, but with feeling, he said, \u201c\n\nWhat the fuck.\n\n\u201d\n\nSomehow, up until this point Izuku had managed to avoid most of the problems cropping up as a result of his baby, The Spreadsheet. The media wanted interviews with the person who had released such a groundbreaking piece of work. People wanted to know if he was going to release more content. Heroes were scared-- who was next? Izuku\u2019s friends hadn\u2019t caught on to the fact that Japan\u2019s most recent political upheaval was single-handedly his doing, for which he was grateful.\nAizawa hadn\u2019t punished him, but was now treating him like a toddler with a grenade: a sweet child who could wreak unmitigated havoc at a moment\u2019s notice. Present Mic seemed to like him even more, oddly enough.\nHis mom had taken one look at the news and deduced her son was behind it. She had hugged him, shed a single tear, and proclaimed how proud his father would have been. That was probably more unsettling than anything else that had happened.\nDespite all the unexpected backlash, Izuku had dealt with the situation through careful deliberation and forethought. This meant that it stung a little bit when the all the shit he had been avoiding for two months caught up with him through sheer dumb luck.\nIzuku stared across the dairy aisle of his local convenience store.\nSelf-proclaimed villain Dabi stared back, hand frozen in front of a box of string cheese.\n\u201cI feel like I should probably fuck your shit up...\u201d Dabi said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t feel like it. Good job exposing Endeavor for the piece of shit he is, kid.\u201d\nIzuku felt like there was an epiphany on the edge of his mind, and Dabi\u2019s throwaway sentence had just pushed that epiphany over the edge. His eye shape and color, the similarity of his voice, his frame, his quirk, his dislike of Endeavor, the box of black hair dye in his basket\u2026\nIzuku connected the dots. \u201cYou\u2019re Todoroki\u2019s missing brother, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he breathed.\nDabi\u2019s face went blank and tiny blue sparks began to erupt on his fingertips.\n\u201cWait, no, hold on WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS!\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t tell anyone if you\u2019re dead in a ditch somewhere.\u201d growled Dabi.\n\u201cYeah, well, we\u2019re kind of in the middle of the store, and I\u2019m pretty sure there are cameras and stuff, but, like, I\u2019m not going to tell anyone so I\u2019d really appreciate it ifyoucouldnotmurdermethanks!\u201d\nDabi scowled and stuffed his hands in his pockets.\n\u201cMy mom\u2019s a lawyer,\u201d Izuku blurted.\nDabi looked at him like he had just declared his intent to marry a grilled cheese sandwich.\n\u201c...And?\u201d\n\u201cYou left because Endeavor was, you know, right? So we can make you a legal case! And- and you could quit being a villain, and reunite with your family members that don\u2019t suck ass!\u201d\nDabi looked lost. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cWhy what?\u201d\n\u201cWhy would you help me?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what a real hero does-- he helps someone whenever he can. But I also have a selfish reason: your brother is my friend. I want to make him happy.\u201d\nDabi was silent for a long, strained moment before nodding tersely. He dropped his basket on the floor and walked away. \u201cWhen you\u2019re done here,\u201d he called over his shoulder, \u201cmeet me outside.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIzuku smiled like he was being held at gunpoint, or having his picture taken for his driver\u2019s license. \u201cHi, mom. I brought home a, uh, friend\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHow nice! What\u2019s your name, dear?\u201d Inko asked, bullheadedly ignoring Dabi\u2019s suspicious, well, everything.\n\u201cDabi,\u201d he grunted.\nIzuku stared him in the eyes until Dabi averted his gaze and corrected, \u201cTodoroki Touya.\u201d\nInko\u2019s face lit up. \u201cWould you happen to be related to--\u201d\nDon\u2019t say Endeavor, don\u2019t say Endeavor! Touya internally begged.\n\u201c--Izuku\u2019s friend Shouto?\u201d\nHe untensed a little. \u201cHe\u2019s my younger brother.\u201d\nInko suddenly regarded him with the intensity of hawk\u2019s eyes, which seemed so out of place on her sweet, genial face.\n\u201cIzuku,\u201d she turned to her son.\n\u201cY-yes?\u201d he yelped.\n\u201cAm I putting together a court case against Endeavor?\u201d she asked quietly.\nTouya felt a drop of sweat roll down his neck. Scarily intelligent! he thought. Oh God, it runs in the family.\nIzuku nodded, every bit as serious as his mother.\n\u201cGood, then get out.\u201d she said.\n\u201cWait, what?!\u201d Izuku did a double take.\n\u201cYou heard me,\u201d she smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll work with your friend here, you go have fun.\u201d\nIzuku opened his mouth to protest.\n\u201cYes, I know you can help,\u201d she interrupted, \u201cbut I don\u2019t want you to. Let Mommy take care of this one, sweetheart.\u201d\nI was wrong, Touya thought. She\u2019s worse!\n\u201cAlright. Should I\u2026 write more inflammatory literature, or something? I\u2019m at a loss.\u201d Izuku said.\n\u201cDo whatever makes you happy, sweetie.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, and walked off to his room, thereby abandoning Touya to his fate.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOnce again, Izuku was accosted on his way into homeroom.\n\u201cDeku!\u201d Uraraka demanded while grabbing his hand. \u201cIs it true? Were you the one that published that spreadsheet thing?\u201d\nHe nearly tripped and faceplanted, despite being stationary at the moment. \u201cWh-who told you?!\u201d\n\u201cSo it is true!\u201d Kirishima exclaimed.\n\u201cTodoroki said so,\u201d Uraraka said sheepishly, \u201cbut we couldn\u2019t tell whether he was joking or not. He\u2019s just got that kind of face, you know?\u201d\nIn the background, Todoroki looked at his face in his phone\u2019s reflection. He touched a hand to his cheek.\n\u201cHey, hey, what\u2019s all this?\u201d Kaminari asked, walking through the door.\nIzuku waved his hands. \u201cNothi--\u201d\n\u201cDeku wrote that spreadsheet!\u201d Uraraka said.\nKaminari tilted his head. \u201cWait, what spreadsheet?\u201d\n\u201cThe Endeavor one,\u201d said Kirishima.\n\u201cBullshit,\u201d Kaminari scoffed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d said Jirou, entering behind Kaminari. \u201cI heard it from Present Mic.\u201d\n\u201cNo way!\u201d said Mina from behind everyone.\nKaminari jumped and screeched, \u201cGyah! How long have you been here, Mina?\u201d\nShe smiled proudly. \u201cLonger than you!\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Ojiro asked from the entrance.\nSeveral students clamored for Ojiro\u2019s attention, all trying to spill the tea. Izuku sighed. Today was going to be a long day.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIzuku was tired of being stared at. It was only lunchtime, yet it seemed half the school knew his secret! For fuck\u2019s sake, even Monoma was leery of him. Monoma! Every business student in the cafeteria and quite a few that Izuku was relatively sure were supposed to be in class right now was crowding him for an autograph, a word of wisdom, or even just to offer him their lunch. To top it all off, Principal Nedzu had approached him about\u2026 something. He was very cryptic about the whole thing, but the general vibe that Izuku got from him was that he wanted to teach(?) him. Ever since that conversation, Izuku couldn\u2019t help but spot Nedzu trailing him wherever he went on campus and-- there he was, hanging from a hole in the cafeteria\u2019s ceiling!\n\u201cOhoho\u2026\u201d Nedzu said and retracted back into the shadowy recess of the ceiling hole. Izuku was Afraid.\nSeveral feet away, Tsuyu felt Mineta\u2019s grubby hand brush her butt and idly asked Uraraka, \u201cDo you think Midoriya takes requests?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIzuku\u2019s mission was, contrary to popular belief, not complete. In fact, he still had that piece of inflammatory literature he was still working on! It was that which drove him to seek out his teachers rather than hiding from all his fellow students. He started with the Management course. Of course, since he had no idea where that particular teacher was, he ventured deep into the heart of enemy territory-- okay, he went to the Management dorms and asked the night students. And left as quickly as he could, considering the hushed whispers of \u201cTen hours!\u201d and \u201cA lock of hair for the shrine\u2026\u201d He managed (pun intended) to run into the Management department head and get the personal interview he wanted on the way out, so he supposed the trip wasn\u2019t a complete waste.\nNext, he sought out his favorite teacher: All Might.\n\u201cAh, Midoriya! I\u2019ve been meaning to talk to you!\u201d he said.\n\u201cReally?\u201d Izuku tilted his head. \u201cWhat for?\u201d\n\u201cI heard a rumor that you released some\u2026 nasty things about Endeavor. What was that for?\u201d\n\u201cHe was a dick to me once and also I don\u2019t like the way he talks to Todoroki.\u201d That was his excuse and he was sticking with it. \u201cBesides, everything I said was true. If it was nasty, it\u2019s his own fault.\u201d\nAll Might waffled. \u201cWell, yes, but be that as it may\u2026 You\u2019re friends with Todoroki, aren\u2019t you? Why would you go after Endeavor\u2019s reputation like that?\u201d\nIzuku smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s the one thing he can\u2019t replace.\u201d\nAll Might forgot how to breathe for a moment. \u201cWh\u2026 What did you say?\u201d\nIzuku folded in on himself a bit in embarrassment. \u201cThe bitch deserved it,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cCan I ask you a couple questions for an essay I\u2019m writing?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d he said in a daze.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAfter interviewing All Might, Snipe, Present Mic, Thirteen, and, of course, his own homeroom teacher, Izuku was ready to head home. Uraraka and Todoroki were waiting to walk home with him, Uraraka because she had stayed late to ask Ectoplasm about the lesson and Todoroki because question mark. As soon as they hit the gate, they were bombarded by cameras, microphones, and overly eager journalists.\nOne particularly brave reporter shoved a recording device in his face and demanded, \u201cWhat made you decide to publish confidential information about a respected and upstanding citizen? Is it because you secretly hate heroes?\u201d\nHe put a hand on Uraraka\u2019s shoulder because she looked ready to combust, shot Todoroki an apologetic glance, and looked directly into the rude reporter\u2019s camera.\n\u201cSecretly hate heroes? That means a lot coming from you, Ms. Tanaka, considering how often you \u2018expose\u2019 heroes who have done nothing but their best. In fact, I believe you recently accused Mount Lady of wanton destruction of property, despite the fact that her rate of destruction is consistently below average. Not to mention your piece on Arrowhead, where you accused him of tax evasion.\u201d\nThe reporter frantically flicked her eyes at the cameraperson, begging them to shut down the live feed.\nIzuku continued, \u201cNot only was everything you said in that article blatantly false incendiary clickbait, but almost all of it was plagiarized from sources such as Hero-Spiracy,\u201d here he nodded to another journalist with the Hero-Spiracy logo on his shirt, \u201cPretty Pros, and even Wikipedia.\u201d\nAt this point, the unfortunate Ms. Tanaka was hiding her face and perhaps even crying. Everyone\u2019s attention was completely captured by Izuku.\n\u201cFurthermore,\u201d he continued, \u201cyour original claim that I released \u2018confidential information\u2019 is also a lie. I cited every source I used, unlike you, each of which was public. You would have known this had you actually bothered to open the document. Seriously, how lazy can you get? Do I need to come to your office and click the Works Cited for you?\u201d\nHe looked around at all the cameras and microphones pointed his way. \u201cAnd you people are hardly better! The last time reporters showed up at U.A. uninvited, they caused a security leak leading to the U.S.J. attack. What if I or one of my friends with me had had a flashback or a panic attack? Would you have publicized that too, you monsters? Go on, shoo! Get out of here.\u201d\nThe flabbergasted crowd looked at each other nervously before dispersing as if they had never shown up in the first place, like a herd of cats.\n\u201cMidoriya,\u201d Todoroki said softly, \u201cI\u2019m going to marry you.\u201d\n\u201cWh-- wh--?!\u201d Izuku stammered loudly, hiding his red face.\n\u201cHey, I want in!\u201d said Uraraka. \u201cSo whose last name are we taking?\u201d\nIzuku sat down on the ground and whimpered.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cAs you can see on this chart, crime in major cities such as Fukuoka, Tokyo, Musutafu and most notably Kyoto has decreased by a whopping eighteen percent while public service and volunteer work on behalf of heroes is at an all-time high. Some say that the decrease in crime is a result of the increased volunteer work, but we here at NHK Newsline know the truth: both of these things were caused by the so-called \u2018Endeavor-Gate\u2019 movement. For those of you who don\u2019t know, this scandal was inspired by a spreadsheet released on several social media which compiled statistics from government resources and crisis-mapping sites. These statistics detailed the magnitude of destruction, injury, and loss of life that several irresponsible heroes, most notably Endeavor, have caused throughout their careers. It has recently come to light that the document was authored by a first year U.A. Hero Course student named Midoriya Izuku. Yesterday, Midoriya released a multi-page report compiling the data from his spreadsheet into a research essay with a very controversial opinion-- he feels that pro hero Endeavor should be arrested and put on trial. Midoriya says, \u2018If Japanese pro heroes are truly so weak and the system so poorly designed that [a drastic increase in villainous activity] would occur, then the system is defunct and needs to be dismantled and rebuilt entirely\u2019. He goes on to say that 'if the Japanese government is too cowardly to bring Endeavor to justice as he deserves, then there will be no other option but to involve the United Nations, as surely the continued protection of a villainous person such as Endeavor is a sign of corruption and incompetence'. Endeavor was unavailable for comment\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDamn, kid,\u201d Touya spoke over the news report on the TV, \u201cyou sure are something else. For a cinnamon roll, you\u2019re pretty terrifying, you know that?\u201d\nIzuku buried his red face in Shouto\u2019s shoulder and sunk into the couch as if it could obscure him completely if he tried hard enough.\n\u201cAt least give Mom some of the credit,\u201d Izuku whined, though it was muffled. \u201cShe\u2019s the one who got you a trial.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I got off with just six months of house arrest, at that! I swear, you\u2019re half demon and you get it from your mother.\u201d\nAs if she was summoned, Inko entered the living room with a handful of mail.\n\u201cSpeak of the devil,\u201d Touya joked to himself.\n\u201cIzuku, sweetie, you\u2019ve got more of those villain letters,\u201d she said, dumping the mail on her son. He extricated himself from his new boyfriend to examine them.\nHer hands fluttered nervously. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure most of these people shouldn\u2019t know where we live,\u201d she said. \u201cShould I take legal action?\u201d\nThe occupants of the room shivered in tandem.\n\u201cUh, no thanks, Mom!\u201d Izuku said quickly. \u201cI\u2019ve got it covered.\u201d\nInko smiled and the Todoroki siblings both breathed a sigh of relief. \u201cI\u2019ll be in the yard if you need me,\u201d she said as they waved to her.\n\u201cAnything interesting?\u201d Shouto looked over Izuku\u2019s shoulder.\n\u201cNo, just the same as usual. A couple of recruitment offers,\u201d he set these aside to hand to the police, \u201cand the rest just say something along the lines of \u2018we\u2019ve stopped doing crime, honest! So if you could please not ruin our lives we would be grateful\u2019. I don\u2019t think any of these are going to seem interesting after the note from Shigaraki.\u201d\nTouya sat up sharply. \u201cThat jackass sent you a letter?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, it was just a smiley face,\u201d Shouto said.\nTouya slouched back into his chair. \u201cGod, that\u2019s creepy.\u201d\n\u201cMom\u2019s on it already,\u201d Izuku said with eyes of fire and a smile that would put Aizawa\u2019s to shame.\n\u201cYou were right,\u201d Shouto whispered. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely half-demon.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo as long as the hero in question--\u201d Aizawa\u2019s lecture was cut off by the emergency broadcast television in the room coming to life. Students and teachers alike all stared in rapt fixation at the reporter on screen, and more importantly, what was behind her. In the distance, several policemen could be seen escorting Pro Hero Endeavor from his own home in handcuffs. Izuku stood up out of his desk and cheered. The rest of his classmates were frozen, unable to verbalize anything about what their resident cinnamon roll had accomplished. All his classmates, that is, save one. Bakugou raised his hand in a silent high five and Izuku took it with tears in his eyes, nearly shedding one when Bakugou didn\u2019t pull it away with a \u201ctoo slow.\u201d\n\u201cJust this once,\u201d Bakugou said, \u201cyou didn\u2019t suck.\u201d\nIzuku let out a high pitched , gleeful whine. \u201cThat\u2019s the nicest thing Kacchan has ever said to me,\u201d he warbled.\nAizawa abandoned his lecture in favor of crawling into his bright yellow sleeping bag. He stuck an arm out of his poofy cocoon and swiped it across his desk, knocking stacks of paper, various pens, and several paperweights onto the floor. He climbed on top of his desk and lay face-down on it. As the din of the television continued, he mumbled, \u201cThank God he\u2019s not a villain.\u201d\nThe Scourge of Hero Society\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With the development of the \u201cEndeavor-gate\u201d movement rapidly sweeping across the nation and even expanding beyond Japan\u2019s borders, one cannot help but to contemplate just how the current pro hero industry managed to produce heroes so lackadaisical and unsympathetic in regards to the damages they cause to their inanimate and human surroundings. It is common knowledge that several European countries such as Germany and the United Kingdom harshly punish their pro heroes for destruction, injury and distress caused by indifference to their surroundings. That is not to say that pro heroes should never cause damage, even to the point of sacrificing a fight or civilian lives; rather, these countries teach their heroes moderation and punish them for excess force. One of the only countries worse than Japan regarding punishments for lack of moderation is the United States of America (Jones 2016). Some notable arrests for excess force include: Germany\u2019s Schnellhund, who served eight months in jail for striking three separate public buildings with lightning in his pursuit of French vigilante Gargouille; Spain\u2019s F\u00e9nix, who served three months in jail and 150 hours of community service for setting an anonymous person\u2019s home on fire when aiming for a villain who calls himself \u201cDon Quixote\u201d, but is regularly referred to as \u201cEl Patat\u00fas\u201d; England\u2019s Nightrunner, who served six months in jail and 300 community service hours because he allegedly \u201cparkoured his way through seven flats\u201d in order to make it to his Dungeons and Dragons game, which he was late for (Goldberg 2014). It is a very striking fact that Endeavor has done many similar things to these heroes and on a much larger scale, yet he remains ranked number one on the national hero charts in the wake of All Might\u2019s retirement.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Out of the 126 countries with a regulated hero system, 93 have instituted mandatory community service in order to maintain a hero license. 101 out of 126 have established punishments for brutality to opponents, be they villain, vigilante, or petty criminal. All of these countries, including Japan, have regulations involving loss of civilian injuries and lives lost (United Nations 2019), though Japan\u2019s laws are looser than many other nations. Japan also has laws regarding lives lost and injuries sustained on behalf of sidekicks and heroes cooperating at the site of a crime. Unfortunately, these laws are, like most of Japan\u2019s laws regulatory of the hero industry, inhibitive at best and derelict at worst.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0While some may argue that Endeavor, being the current number one Japanese hero, cannot be lost so soon after All Might, it is imperative to recognize that he is not the only hero putting in hours, just the most well-known. Others may say that the system has functioned fine for a long time, and \u201cif it is not broken, do not fix it,\u201d in the words of Councillor Watanabe (Fujimoto 2018). The simple fact of the matter is that the system is in fact broken. The fact that so many people believe that the system will collapse with the loss of one hero indicates that a major reform is in order, starting with arresting Endeavor and putting him on trial for his flagrant disregard of the few hero-regulating laws that Japan possesses. His place on the hero ranking chart should not grant him immunity to justice.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0One of the simplest issues lies in volunteer work, which inspires goodwill. In direct contrast with the majority of the U.N., Japan does not impose mandatory community service on its heroes (United Nations 2019). In a personal interview, All Might has stated, \u201cKeeping your hero license in America is harder than it is in Japan. I remember [...] spending a lot of time at the animal shelter.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Many heroes, such as Present Mic, perform volunteer work anyway; however, Endeavor is one of the many pro heroes that perform community service work rarely. In Kotaru Homura\u2019s controversial article  Vilification or Volunteer Work , Kotaru states that Endeavor\u2019s community service almost always coincides with a scandal (2017).\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Another objectionable facet of Japanese hero society embodied and perpetrated by Endeavor is the sheer level of property damage the man generates. As stated earlier, Spanish pro hero F\u00e9nix served three months of jail time and 150 hours of community service for setting one private residence on fire (Goldberg 2014). This is a very stark contrast to Endeavor\u2019s record-- in 27 years of being a pro hero, he has set fire to 43 private residences, 218 public buildings, and destroyed or caused severe damage to an additional 114 structures (Kotaru 2017). Because of the way the current laws are set up, he has paid for none of this. Instead, the repairs are paid for by the government, according to Mashima Ryuuhei, the head of U.A.\u2019s business department. Average citizens should not have to pay excess taxes just because heroes like Endeavor cannot control themselves. Additionally, since he doesn\u2019t pay for any of the damages he causes, he most likely has a very diminished sense of worth of property, if any at all. This only ensures that he will continue to treat others\u2019 property recklessly. In a personal interview, pro hero Snipe had this to say:\n\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t know how it is in other parts of the world, but in America, they\u2019ve got the same kind of laws. But instead of just paying the extra taxes like we do here, the public gets real mad. Why, in Texas, I saw one poor hero running from an angry mob because he flooded a major intersection.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Endeavor\u2019s rampant destruction of property is an issue not only for obvious reasons, but also because destroying buildings can put civilians at risk of injury or death, can put residents of a building out of a home, can destroy their place of work and therefore their means of income, and can even put intense financial stress upon low-income citizens whose insurance does not completely cover rebuilding and medical bills. Sasagawa Hanako had this to say in a personal interview:\n\u201cI used to live in a pretty poor area; I was a college student, so I couldn\u2019t afford a better place. It had a lot of villain activity, and most heroes never came close unless they were chasing someone. That Endeavor [\u2026] set my apartment complex on fire. No one was killed, and we all got out fine except for some minor burns, but my wife and I lost our scrapbooks, which we had been making together since middle school. We were devastated. Also, I\u2019m pretty sure my cat has asthma now. From the smoke inhalation, you see.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Another shameful aspect of Endeavor\u2019s career indicative of Japanese hero society as a whole is his brutality. It is a well-known phenomenon that a large percentage of petty criminals will turn themselves in without a fight once a hero shows up on the scene. It is because of this that areas with more visible hero patrols usually have lower crime rates, even if the heroes doing the patrolling in question do not actually arrest anyone. One of Endeavor\u2019s many ex-sidekicks, who has chosen to remain anonymous, claimed in a personal interview conducted over e-mail that Endeavor \u201ckicks the living shit out of everyone regardless of their compliance\u201d. Some argue that if someone was committing a crime, they deserve to put taken in with force. This is a barbaric way of thinking, and a near-transparent pardoning of modified police brutality. Additionally, criminals in fear of brutality are more likely to take hostages and threaten innocent bystanders (Abarai 2017). Even if police brutality has suddenly become excusable to the general public, there still remains the very real possibility that an unfortunate bystander may be mistaken for a criminal. What if an excessively forceful hero captured the wrong person and ended up brutalizing an innocent? There have been cases of this happening not only in other countries but also in Japan, and many times the victim was left paying their own bills because the hero claimed it was an \u201caccident\u201d. This makes it not only easy for the hero to avoid paying hospital bills, but also more difficult for the victim to get the proper insurance payments. This happened to Masato Rinmaru, who said this in an interview with Yamamoto Ken regarding ex-hero Shadowmaster:\n\u201cIt was so awful. I kept insisting, \u2018it wasn\u2019t me, please, I didn\u2019t do it,\u2019 but he wouldn\u2019t listen. I spent two weeks in the hospital and I had to pay for it all. I tried to tell someone, anyone that would listen, but he had a really good PR team and, uh\u2026 Well, no one wanted to listen to me until he got busted for the stuff he did with in China. I still have nightmares about it.\u201d (Yamamoto 2011)\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Another topic that is necessary to examine in the pursuit of justice is the topic of injuries and casualties. Many are reluctant to discuss this, but it needs to be talked about. Obviously no hero can save everyone, but as a hero as well as a decent human being, it is one\u2019s duty to try one\u2019s hardest. Time and again, Endeavor has shown disregard for those around him during combat. Several of his sidekicks and additional heroes responding as backup have sustained avoidable injuries while serving with him. Two rookie sidekicks have died when Endeavor was on the scene (Kotaru 2017), and while it is discourteous and unnecessarily vile to lay the blame for this solely at Endeavor\u2019s feet, it is inarguable that he was not as cautious as he should have been.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Civilians are in even more danger than those participating in a fight in this regard; heroes and sidekicks are trained professionals, whereas civilians are not. An estimated 400 civilians have perished in conflicts involving Endeavor (Kotaru 2017), and while in 27 years of service some casualties are to be expected, a number this high is simply unacceptable.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Endeavor also places his coworkers in harm\u2019s way. He has burned several coworkers unintentionally because they were \u201cin his way\u201d and \u201cshould have dodged faster\u201d (Kotaru 2017). Debaters are split on this issue-- some say that it is common sense to keep one\u2019s distance while someone is using a fire quirk. These people believe that anyone who gets burned by Endeavor because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time during a fight have only themselves to blame. These people have clearly never attended a hero school; children aspiring to be heroes learn basic situational awareness during their first semester. The fact that Endeavor\u2019s quirk is destructive and often an area-of-effect type is irrelevant. All Might punched a potential child-murderer so hard that he changed the weather, yet he still managed to not only not harm those around him (including the endangered child and myself) but also actively worked to keep his coworkers safe, as a real hero should.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mochida Shiori, a reporter for Hero-Spiracy, claims that with All Might retired, criminal activity has the potential to hit an all-time high and that the only thing stopping these potential criminals is Endeavor, a \u201cnecessary evil\u201d as Mochida refers to him (Mochida 2019). If Japanese pro heroes are truly so weak and the system so poorly designed that this would occur, then the system is defunct and needs to be dismantled and rebuilt entirely. If the number one hero protecting the populace is actually a villain on the side of the law, then something is undeniably wrong.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It is not an opinion but a fact that Endeavor has done many things that would be considered unacceptable and even heinous by the standards of other countries. He has gotten away with these things simply because he is the ideal product of the Japanese hero industry. Just because the things he\u2019s done are legal do not make them morally or ethically right. Hero society in this nation needs to be fixed, starting with its figurehead, Endeavor. If the Japanese government is too cowardly to bring Endeavor to justice as he deserves, then there will be no other option but to involve the United Nations, as surely the continued protection of a villainous person such as Endeavor is a sign of corruption and incompetence. Martial law under the rule of the United Nations is preferable to the continuation of this current blatant corruption and savagery.\n\u00a0\nWorks Cited\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Abarai, Kazuko. \u201cThe Crime of Necessity.\u201d  Hero Law  , vol. 7, no. 5, ser. 4, 2 Dec. 2017, p. 14.  4 .\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fujimoto, Shinzu. \u201cCouncillor Watanabe's View on Hero Regulation.\u201d  Kyoto Weekly , 15 Oct. 2018, p.
