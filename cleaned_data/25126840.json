    "text": "\u201cIf I let you come to school with me, what do I get in return, Problem Child?\u201d Shouta said, looking dubiously at his son, whose first year class at Shiketsu High had been graciously awarded a rest day after a week of intensive training. His son, Aizawa Izuku, was also now desperately trying to get him to agree to let Izuku tag along with him to UA to sit in on his classes for the day. It was early morning, and Izuku had just finished making breakfast (like he did every morning after his dad\u2019s night patrols even though the man insisted he didn\u2019t have to. He had gotten a stern \u2018Let someone take care of you sometimes Ot\u014d-san\u2019 from Izuku who was surprisingly threatening, for a 14 year old in a Present Mic apron, when he wanted to be). \nShouta was sipping gingerly on a cup of freshly brewed coffee, when he asked what Izuku was doing on his day off. Izuku had then sprung the question of attending school with Shouta on him. The boy was now looking up at him with big, pleading green eyes that they both knew Shouta couldn\u2019t say no to, and was awaiting an answer.\n\u201cI\u2019ll stop hiding those nasty pouch meals from you when you work graveyard shifts for a week.\u201d he said innocently, trying his best to bargain. Dammit, Shouta thought Hizashi was the one who was hiding his pouches. Shouta sighed, knowing that Izuku would get his way one way or the other. He narrowed his eyes at the boy, who perked up under his gaze in knowing anticipation.\n\u201cFine, but be on your best behaviour.\u201d \n\u201cTHANK YOU OT\u014cSAN!\u201d Suddenly there was a surprisingly solid teenager wrapped around his midsection, rubbing his face into the fabric of Shouta\u2019s sweater. Shouta chuckles softly at his boy\u2019s antics and pats Izuku\u2019s head of curls gently.\n\u201cMaybe you can help me with my first years. Meeting you might be good for them, don\u2019t think brat?\u201d \n\u201cDo I have permission to sass people?\u201d\n\u201cWould me giving you permission make a difference?\u201d he levels Izuku with a look. The boy shrugs.\n\u201cMaybe. For peace of mind.\u201d\nShouta quirks an eyebrow at the teen still wrapped around him like a koala, levelling him with a flat look. \u201cMine or yours?\u201d he asks.\nIzuku finally pulls away from his hug and straightening himself, he looks at Shouta with a mischievous grin. \u201cWhichever makes you feel better, Ot\u014d-san.\u201d\nIzuku then bolts out of the room, most likely already planning a list of questions for every person he is bound to meet at UA, or perhaps preparing a notebook for notes on Shouta\u2019s first years. Shouta shakes his head fondly, his chest swelling with pride and happiness at Izuku\u2019s enthusiasm, a testament to how far he\u2019d come from the small, scared, orphaned boy Shouta found in the ashes of that apartment years ago. \nFor a split second, the cries of a small child amidst pillars of flame and smoke, the smell of burning flesh and the pained pleas for help all flash through Shouta\u2019s mind. A domestic violence case, one that had spiralled wildly out of control resulting in the death of Izuku\u2019s mother and father, had beckoned Shouta to the apartment complex in Mustafa. It was there in the midst of the destruction that he had found Izuku, beneath what may have been a table, curled tightly into himself, crying and scared. His chest tightens, even now, remembering the fear and guilt in those eyes, and Shouta thinks that perhaps that was the moment he vowed to keep that child, his child now, safe and sound. Though Izuku still harboured scars from the fire across his back and shoulders, and smaller, starburst-shaped scars along his neck and arms (that he still refused to tell Shouta how he got, though presumably from a former bully), through therapy and long, exhausting but necessary conversations with Shouta, his trauma did not hinder Izuku\u2019s development in the slightest, even though traces of it remained.\nNow 8 years later, after adopting the 6 year old quirkless boy whom he refused to let into the atrocity that was Japan\u2019s foster care system and raising Izuku as his own, Shouta had a devastatingly intelligent, deceptively strong and boundlessly kind son, who he loved with all his heart. The boy had been through more than any one person should ever have to deal with. From the quirk discrimaination and bullying (which were brought to Shouta\u2019s attention shortly after Izuku began living with him), the abuse from his ungrateful bastard of a biological father (in Shouta\u2019s humble opinion), the death of his mother, who was the little boy\u2019s whole world, and the subsequent happenings of being thrust into the life of the son of a full-time teacher and Pro Hero. \nBut Izuku, ever resilient, had blossomed with Shouta, honing his skills for analysis, learning various forms of modern and traditional martial arts and fighting styles, and now the first quirkless child to attend Shiketsu High (top of his class and the year group) and aiming to be an Underground Hero (Like Ot\u014d-san! he had said when asked why, his dimpled and freckled cheeks stretched in a wide, proud smile that, Shouta was reluctant to admit, had made him shed a tear), all while still managing to be the kind, loving, selfless boy that his mother had raised him to be. \nShouta, finally pulling himself out of his reminiscing and finishing off his coffee, pushes himself off the counter, washes his cup and then heads to his room to get ready for the day. He just knows that Izuku combined with his troublesome first years, Class 1-A, was bound to be \u2026 interesting and very likely exhausting as well. Shouta sighs as he walks down the hall, dodging their Siamese, Latte, and their Russian blue, Charcoal, who were weaving in and out of his legs as he walked. Shouta let out another sigh, already feeling the exhaustion seeping into his bones, wondering just what fresh bout of chaos his son would bring down on the halls of UA.\n\u00a0\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\nShouta stood outside the door to Class 1-A, checking his watch as he listened to the chatter behind the door. \n8:24:18\nShouta had already told Izuku to wait for them at Gym Gamma, and to wear his costume. Shouta wanted to test how well his student held up against Izuku. All Might was also supposed to be joining them.\n8:24:35\nHe was also anxious about how Izuku would be received. He was no stranger to quirk discrimination, and unfortunately had no doubt that these children would have been brought up to perpetuate those disgusting, ableist ideals. They were good children whose hearts were in the right places, but the kind of thinking that, sadly, the entirety of the Hero Industry and their society at large were built on, would get them seriously hurt. And he had no doubt that Izuku would have a ball making them see the errors of their way of thinking.\n8:24:55\nShouta cleared his head of those thoughts for the time being, listening to the sounds of 1-A quieting down, and grabbed the door handle and flung the door open.\n8:25:00\nEveryone was seated and looking at him with bright smiles. \u201cGOOD MORNING AIZAWA-SENSEI!\u201d they exclaimed loudly, though some (Iida and Mina) more loudly than others. He gave them a nod in response and walked to the front of the class to take attendance.\nWhen that was over and done with he addressed them directly.\n\u201cChange into your P.E. uniforms and meet me at Gym Gamma. We are going to do a physical test today, and we have a guest today. Try not to make fools of yourselves.\u201d\nHe exits the classroom with a dramatic slam of the door, one that Izuku surely would have made fun of him for if he had seen him.\nThe classroom erupts into curious chatter in his wake, all keen on knowing who their guest is as they make their way to the gym with their uniforms. \n\u201cDo you think it\u2019s someone we know? Or maybe a Pro Hero?\u201d asks Uraraka.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know Ochaco-chan but it must be somebody important, if he doesn\u2019t want us to make a fool of ourselves, kero~\u201d pipes Tsuyu from beside her, as Iida vigorously nods his agreement and Todoroki and Shinsou only hum in response. \nKirishima and Kaminari are bouncing with excitement, while Bakugou only grumbles at their noisy and disruptive behaviour.\n\u201cDo you have any idea of who it could be? I wonder what their quirk is,\u201d Kirishimi says, grinning excitedly at Kaminari. \n\u201cWhat if they're a cute girl, or a cute boy?\u201d Kaminari retaliates jokingly, and in turn receives a resounding \u201cthump!\u201d on the back of the head from Bakugou.\n\u201cShut up Sparky! It doesn\u2019t matter if they're fucking hot, I\u2019m gonna beat \u2018em anyway. So stay out of the way you damn extras!\u201d Bakugou shouts, in his usual brash tone.\n\u00a0\nMeanwhile, in Gym Gamma, Izuku was standing next to his father in his full gear, with the exception of his mouth guard and his xiphoids, which his Ot\u014d-san had deemed unnecessary. The dark browns and greys of his costume, along with his heavy black boots and weighted fingerless gloves, all tight on his well-toned body, along with his goggles, pushed up on his head, that made his viridian pupils key-holed, just like a snake\u2019s, made him out to be surprisingly intimidating despite his unassuming stature. As Izuku rolls up the sleeves of his costume to reveal his scarred forearms, starbursts dancing across his skin, his Ot\u014d-san turns to him while inspecting his costume and asks, \u201cYou got your knives and staff?\u201d\n\u201cYup! I got everything right here,\u201d Izuku replies, patting the pockets that housed his knives, long and curved, just like the fangs of a gaboon viper, and the blades were laced with a mild anaesthetic, just enough to render an opponent unconscious for about a half an hour. \u201cI wonder what your little heroes will think of me using knives? Scandalized maybe?\u201d\nShoutout chuckles softly at his son\u2019s question, already picturing Iida\u2019s aghast expression and Yaoyorozu\u2019s flustered apprehension. \u201cProbably. Some of them will definitely enjoy it though,\u201d hearing Kirishima and Kaminari\u2019s enthusiastic yelling in his head.\n\u201cYou like them,\u201d Izuku says after a minute of silence, giving Shouta a sly grin and a knowing arch of an eyebrow. \u201cLook at you Ot\u014d-san, getting attached to children. I always knew you were a softie.\u201d\n\u201cAnother word out of you and I\u2019ll string you up from the ceiling, Problem Child,\u201d Shouta says with no heat, his eyes smiling, as Izuku mimes zipping his mouth shut, mirth evident in his eyes.\nThe two sense someone entering the room, and their eyes travel to the doorway. Yagi is standing there in his muscular form, looking at them with a curious glint in his sunken blue eyes. He approaches them, and greets them both politely. \n\u201cGood morning Aizawa-kun. Who may this young man be?\u201d he asks, observing Izuku, not unkindly.\nShouta watches as Izuku inspects Yagi with a focused gaze. Shouta knows that Izuku already knows All Might\u2019s true form, even before Shouta had told him, citing that the man was so careless, even he could figure it out from the numerous times he\u2019d attended formal functions with his father. Shouta is convinced that Izuku doesn\u2019t realize how scary his intuition is, or maybe he does.\n\u201cGood morning Yagi-san. My name is Izuku. I\u2019m here to assist with training,\u201d Izuku says, smiling innocently, as if he didn\u2019t just figure out the identity of the Number 1 Hero. Shouta almost lets out an unattractive snort at Yagi\u2019s shocked face, and his subsequent shout of alarm. Izuku offers him a smile but nothing else.\n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t tell him. Figured it out himself. He\u2019s just too smart for his own good. It gets him in trouble sometimes,\u201d Shouta says, giving Izuku a slightly disappointed glance, and the boy just rubs the back of his neck sheepishly. \u201cHe\u2019s my son, so he\u2019s seen you at most of the functions that I\u2019ve been forced to attend since I adopted him, both as All Might and as Yagi, and made the connection himself.\u201d\nYagi looks at the boy next to Aizawa, and gives him an impressed smile. \u201cWell it\u2019s very nice to meet you, young man. I look forward to working with you.\u201d He stretches out a thick hand to the boy, who smiles up at him and shakes his hand in return. \u201cDon\u2019t you have school today?\u201d\n\u201cShiketsu doesn\u2019t have school today, so he begged me to let him tag along, unfortunately,\u201d Shouta pipes in.\n\u201cYou\u2019re just mad because you can\u2019t say no to me Ot\u014d-san,\u201d Izuku quips, with a mischievous grin.\nShouta just sighs but doesn\u2019t deny what they both know is true. Yagi watches both of them with a fond smile, this being the first time he\u2019d seen Shouta not angry at the world. \n\u00a0\nAt that moment, the students of Class 1-A start filing into the gym, everyone\u2019s eyes immediately landing on the figure standing next to their home room teacher and All Might, who is surprisingly, their age. He had goggles resting on a head of wild, green curls, and was dressed in a costume of muted browns and grey, fitted and sleek, with many pockets and compartments that glinted like scales under the gym lights. He had scars running up the length of his neck and forearms and one creeping up the left side of his jaw, freckled cheeks and a wide smile, as he chatted with All Might.\n\u201cHe\u2019s cute!\u201d whispers Uraraka quietly to Tsuyu. She wonders who he is.\nShouta notices the class walk in, and straightens slightly. Izuku, picking up on his shift in behaviour, politely cuts short his conversation with All MIght about life at Shiketsu, to turn and face his father\u2019s students. He smiles gently at the crowd of incoming students, observing them and noting some interesting ones, like the girl with the features of a frog, a boy with bi-coloured hair and another boy with purple hair that kind of reminded him of his Ot\u014d-san.\nAs Shouta prepares to address the students and introduce Izuku to them, a shout rings through the crowd.\n\u201cDEKU!! WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING HERE??\u201d Bakugou screeches, startling the students surrounding him. Immediately, there are sirens going off in Shouta\u2019s head. He hadn\u2019t heard the word \u2018deku\u2019 since Izuku was about 9 years old. Still suffering from nightmares, Shouta would try for hours to calm the boy as he cried and screamed, that he wasn\u2019t a Deku, that he wasn't a burden, that he wasn\u2019t useless. Finally, the sunbursts littered across Izuku's body made horrifying sense. It made him sick. It had never occurred to Shouta that one of his son\u2019s tormentors would be his own students. Bakugou looks ready to pounce and before he can think Shouta can feel his hands moving to his capture weapon of their own accord. \nA scarred hand stretched out to slam against Shouta\u2019s chest. He looks at Izuku, whose eyes are devoid of fear or worry, they are focused and calm. Shouta allows himself a moment to relax and think rationally and Izuku slowly removes his hand, turning to look at Bakugou. His eyes are unreadable and calculating as he gives the other boy a once over. \nEveryone in the class stands stock-still, watching as the strange boy looks at Bakugou calmly, not the usual way any person who isn\u2019t used to him reacts to Bakugou. He finally makes eye contact with the blond, and to everyone\u2019s surprise, smiles warmly at the blond.\n\u201cNice to see you again Katsuki. It\u2019s been, what 9 years? You seem well,\u201d the boy says. His eyes are staring intently at Bakugou\u2019s face, as if challenging Bakugou. His calm kindness seems to tick Bakugou off even more.\n\u201cWhat is this useless fuck doing here?\u201d He addresses the question to Shouta, who uses every morsel of professionalism he possesses to prevent himself from answering with hostility. Izuku is clearly not immediately dissolving into hysterics and seems keen on continuing training as planned, and Shouta has no doubt that he would explain everything to him when they get home. He sighs audibly after studying Izuku and Bakugou for a second.\n\u201cThis is Izuku. He is a Hero student at a school in the West. He\u2019s here to help with training. And Bakugou be respectful, because if I hear you or any of you,\u201d he sweeps his eyes over the class, eyes glowing red and hair flaring as he activates his quirk, his tone as serious as 1-A has ever heard it, \u201ccalling him \u2018deku\u2019, you will be expelled.\u201d For a few seconds they all seem appropriately threatened, and Shouta is ready to move onto training when Bakugou pipes in again.\n \u201cTRAINING?! What can this quirkless nerd fucking help me with?\u201d\n\u201cBakubro that\u2019s not nice!\u201d Kirishima interjects.\nImmediately, a soft murmur runs through the group of students, and even All Might looks mildly surprised. They all start looking at the boy, Izuku, whispering and speculating before another voice interjects. \n\u201cIs that true? Are you actually quirkless?\u201d It\u2019s Shinsou who asks the question.\nIzuku turns to him, and examines him. He then gives him a small smile and an answer, \u201cYes, I am quirkless.\u201d\nIida\u2019s hand shoots into the air, and he booms out his question after Shouta properly grants him permission to speak. \u201cSensei, I think it is highly unsafe for a quirkless person to join us in our training, as they could be seriously hurt.\u201d A hum of agreement goes through the group of students.\n\u201cYou\u2019re Tensei-kun\u2019s little brother right? I\u2019m disappointed. I would have thought that he would have taught you better than that.\u201d Izuku says, unbothered by the offended expression on Iida\u2019s face and the shocked expressions on the faces of his classmates.\n\u201cWhat is that supposed to mean?\u201d Iida asks, bristling at the statement.\n\u201cIt means that the Tensei-kun that I know wouldn\u2019t teach his brother to perpetuate bigoted, quirkist ideals. They are harmful, untrue and a blatant sign of ignorance to those who are actually quirkless.\u201d Iida rears back as if slapped. A few gasps rise from the class.\nShouta holds back a smile. This is exactly what he knew would happen. Izuku was a fiery spirit, especially in the face of any injustice, and one so close to his heart would definitely spark a conversation that the students needed to hear if they intended to be Heroes. Shouta notices that Yagi seems like he wants to intervene. He stops him discreetly saying, \u201cThey need to hear this, and they need to hear it now. Izuku is the best person for them to learn this from.\u201d\nYagi looks puzzled. \u201cLearn what?\u201d\nShouta merely nods toward Izuku, directing the attention back onto his son, who was no doubt about to put on a show.\nIida\u2019s face contorts into a scowl, and Uraraka and a few other squawk indignantly, but Izuku\u2019s voice cuts through their noise like a hot knife through butter.\n\u201cYou think my lack of a quirk makes me weak.\u201d It\u2019s a statement, not a question. His eyes scan those of Class 1-A, at least the ones who hadn\u2019t averted their eyes in guilt at his statement.\n\u201cWell...no offense my dude, but being a Hero without a quirk could put you in a lot of danger,\u201d Kaminari pipes in, voice shaking slightly, his words punctuated with nervous laughter.\n\u201cAnd being a Hero with that kind of prejudice will get you killed.\u201d His words make a few children flinch back. His eyes land on Bakugou, unafraid and knowing as he says, \u201cVillains aren\u2019t just bad guys with strong quirks. Abusers, rapists, murderers, bigots and bullies don\u2019t need quirks to do the things they do. Most people don\u2019t have quirks that can stop a bullet to the brain, or a well placed knife to the throat. Villains don\u2019t need quirks to hurt. People aren\u2019t just heroes just by way of having a strong quirk. Heroes and Villains aren't defined by what quirk they have. They're defined by their actions. So thinking that your quirk will help you in any situation, just because you have one, could cost you your life.\u201d \nIzuku gives them a moment, letting his words stew for a moment. He observes Bakugou, who looks definitely less confident but just as angry, and Iida who looks thoroughly reprimanded.\n\"Even still, someone without a quirk would be at a disadvantage against someone with one.\" Momo says, looking sheepish when Izuku's eyes land on her.\n\" As you all will be as well. Quirk compatibility greatly influences a Heroes success rate. That doesn't mean you can't win, just because their quirk is stronger. Training, intelligence, adaptability, situational awareness and social skills. These are the things that make you a hero not your quirk or, in my case, lack thereof. Any quirk that a hero has can be destructive in the wrong hands, as can any quirk that a villain has can be used for good. Quirks aren't inherently good or bad, they are not the be all and end all of being a hero. They are tools, and you all were fortunate to be born with yours, while I had to forge my own.\"\nThe class is quiet. Some look guilty, some look like they're about to cry, some look enlightened. A few still look sceptical. Shouta realizes, and with full confidence in his son, suggests something.\n\"Why doesn't one of you fight him? You still look like you don't believe him. So give him the chance to show you.\"\nEveryone looks hesitant, but one person jumps at the opportunity.\n\"Tch. I'll fight the fucking nerd! Like if some quirkless nobody can beat me. I'll blast his fucking head off!\" Bakugou exclaims, already pushing his way through his classmates.\nShouta looks at Izuku, who is smiling to himself, seemingly already equipped with a plan of action to take Bakugou down.\nThey take their places a few feet apart, facing each other, as the class and All Might look on. Shouta stands between them.\n\"Rules are simple. Use what you know to take the other person to the ground, and keep them there for 5 seconds.\"\nHe takes a few steps back, and grabs his capture weapon just in case things escalate too fast. \n\"Start whenever you're ready!\" He calls.\nImmediately Bakugou lunges forward, using his explosions to propel him, and starting, as usual, with a right hook. Izuku waits until the last moment to side-step him and grab his wrist and twist it, just enough to be painful. Using the moment of pain to his advantage, Izuku kicks the back of his knee, sending Bakugou to his knees.\nBakugou's left hand comes up and directs a blast to Izuku's face, and to everyone's surprise, he barely even flinches. In response, he grabs the blond's left hand and pushes both up between his shoulder blades, the other boy grimacing in pain. Bakugou struggles fiercely, managing to free his left hand, with which he directs another explosion towards his face. This time it stuns Izuku momentarily, giving Bakugou enough time to force Izuku backwards. \nInstead of letting the other boy pin him down with his weight, Izuku pushes himself further away by kicking off of Bakugou\u2019s back, rolling backward and righting himself into a low crouch. From his low position, he sees Bakugou already blasting himself in his direction. Izuku pulls his knives out of their sheaths on his thighs, ones that had gone unnoticed by the other occupants of the gym until now. The 6-inch long, curved blades glint menacingly under the harsh gym lights, causing more than a few students to let out shouts of alarm, who all immediately turn to their homeroom teacher.\nShouta takes in their shocked and worried expressions in his periphery, and lets out a breath that 1-A assumes is a laugh. He looks at them and says, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Izuku knows what he\u2019s doing. Just watch,\u201d nodding in the direction of Bakugou and Izuku.\nIzuku has now taken a fighting stance, his feet shoulder width apart and his hands right under his jaw, guarding his face. His knives are facing downward, seeming to curve out of Izuku himself. He stands perfectly still. Not a twitch or flinch, his stance stable and his eyes focused and his body practically unmoving. \nStill and vigilant, like a snake in wait of its prey.\nBakugou, who had frozen when Izuku had pulled out his knives, now seems to grow impatient as Izuku remains unmoving. His face twists into a deep scowl as he rubs at his wrists gently, swearing colourfully as he propels himself forward with his explosions, full speed at Izuku.\n\u201cWhat the fuck Deku!! Think just because you dodged a few hits you're hot shit, huh? You\u2019re just a useless quirkless fucking nobody. DIEE!!\u201d he screams, directing a roundhouse at Izuku\u2019s head with his right leg, once he\u2019s within range.\nIzuku, who had still been perfectly stationary until now, ducks under the incoming leg while touching just the tip of his blade to appendage in question. It would only result in a long thin scratch, but the knife tearing through the fabric of his uniform and the little droplets of blood now running down his leg were enough to distract Bakugou long enough for Izuku to step behind him. As Bakugou\u2019s leg drops to the ground, Izuku, already positioned behind the blond, flips his knife in his hand, and rams the butt of the handle into a pressure point on the left of Bakugou\u2019s neck.\nBakugou drops to the ground face-first, like a marionette cut free from its stings, his body making a dull \u2018thump\u2019 against the gym floor. Izuku gently places his foot onto Bakugou\u2019s back.\n\u201c1...2...3...4...5. Well, that\u2019s done and over with, now....anybody else thinks that their quirk alone is enough for them to beat me?\u201d Izuku says,turning to face Class 1-A. They all look at him with varying degrees of amazement, with a healthy dose of scepticism. A few seconds pass, and the gym is silent. The next second has questions pouring out of the students before Izuku can even properly listen to one. Quirks are firing off in the melee to know more about Izuku, Kaminari\u2019s excitement making the hair of the people around him stand on end and Dark Shadow chattering excitedly among many other signs of the classes new found curiosity towards the peculiar teen before them.\nIzuku, while trying his best to decipher even some coherent Japanese in the noise (and failing), had picked up Bakugou\u2019s body and was handing him off to All Might, who takes the unconscious blond to Recovery Girl. He shared a look with his Ot\u014d-san, who nodded and turned towards the class, who were still spewing questions at lightning speed.\nActivating his quirk, and speaking in his usual calm yet commanding tone he says, \u201cBe quiet. If you have a question, raise your hand and wait until I call on you. If you don't have a question, pay attention and be courteous to those who do.\u201d\nAs everyone quiets down and people begin to rain their hands, Izuku takes his place next to Shouta. He shoots Izuku a look, silently asking if he\u2019s okay to continue. Izuku gives him a smile and a reassuring nod, as they both direct their attention to the class once more to answer some questions.\nKirishima is the first to be picked, and he asks his question, voice laced with concern, \u201cIs Bakugou going to be alright?\u201d\n\u201cYes, of course he will. He\u2019s just passed out. He should be up in about 30 minutes.\u201d\nShinsou is next, asking a simple \u201cHow did you do that?\u201d\nIzuku smiles and explains, \u201cStimulation of the Vagus nerve sends a false signal to the brain, saying that the person has high blood pressure. Because of this the body tries to lower the blood pressure, but because his blood pressure isn\u2019t actually high, and it\u2019s lowered further by the Vagus nerve and that\u2019s why he passed out. The point that I hit is referred to as sStomach 9 in acupuncture.\u201d\nAfter that the questions keep coming and Izuku answers them in stride. \n\u201cWhy do you use knives?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re versatile weapons that can be used for offense, defense, are easily concealable and also useful for things like picking locks or windows because of both the size and flexibility of the blades that I use.\u201d\n\u201cHow long have you been training?\u201d\n\u201cAbout 6 years. I had to get a head start to even be able to contest people who are born quirked. But because of that now I\u2019m at an advantage. I also don\u2019t have the issue of being too reliant on my quirk, because\u2026 well I don\u2019t have one.\u201d\n\u201cWho trained you?\u201d\n\u201cMy Ot\u014d-san, mainly at first. Then I got teachers in different fighting styles, along with some other Pro Heroes.\u201d\nEveryone seems to pause at that. \u201cYour father is a Pro Hero?\u201d Todoroki pipes in, asking what everyone now wants to know. Izuku realizes that beyond his name, he hasn\u2019t been properly introduced.\n\u201cHow rude of me! I didn\u2019t even introduce myself properly,\u201d he bows deeply and continues,\u201d My name is Aizawa Izuku. I am a first year Hero Student at Shiketsu High in the West of Japan. I am also an apprentice under Eraserhead, my Ot\u014d-san.\u201d\nThe class gapes, shooting looks between one another, then between Shouta and Izuku, and finally between themselves and the pair in question. Izuku lets out a laugh at their surprise, one that floats through the gym. It\u2019s loud and bright and it warms Shouta\u2019s heart, so much that he smiles softly at Izuku, ruffling his hair. \n\u201cOh wow. He really is his son.\u201d Kaminari\u2019s voice cuts through their little moment. Everyone seems to aree, people humming in assent or pointing out similarities. They all fall quiet when Momo raises her hand to ask a question. Shouta nods in her direction and she continues.\n\u201cWere you perhaps on the papers, your face is very familiar but they referred to you by another name.\u201d\nShouta takes the chance to speak, already seeing the light flush on Izuku\u2019s freckled cheeks. The boy was too humble for his own good.\n\u201cHe was. He is the first quirkless student to be admitted into a Hero school. He came first in both Shiketsu\u2019s academic and physical tests and is still at the top of his year group. A small local paper did an interview with him to empower kids with unique quirks, or none at all. They called him by his Hero name. Viper.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s so cool.\u201d\nIzuku hums, continuing by saying, \u201cI still have a long way to go. I\u2019ve got to grow and mature and adapt. It\u2019s not going to be easy, not by a long shot. There will always be people who see me as less than, but they aren\u2019t going to stop me. Although I\u2019m still a hatchling, one day I\u2019ll be a Hero that saves people. Just like Ot\u014d-san.\u201d Izuku smiles lovingly at Shouta, causing more than a few people to coo at the pair. Shouta only shakes his head, not willing to show any more affection as openly as he already had.\nHe dismisses the class, telling them that they will continue with something more theoretical. There\u2019s an excited glint in Izuku\u2019s eyes, ever as enthusiastic about theory as he is about fighting. As the students walk off, the father and son lag behind, Izuku posing a question to Shouta.\n\u201cBet you\u2019re glad you let me tag along. Imagine how boring and predictable your day would be without me?\u201d\nShouta rolls his eyes, but smiles nonetheless. \u201cI am glad you tagged along. Imagine how long these kids would have been held back by their prejudice if not for your wake up call. You may still be a hatchling, but you\u2019re already saving people. From their bigoted ideals, from a mindset that is sure to get them killed, from themselves.\u201d\nIzuku hides his face in his hands, blushing furiously at the praise, the knife-wielding Hero in training reduced to a stuttering mess. \u201cOt\u014d-san!! You can\u2019t just say things like that out of the blue!!! Give a kid some warning!! \u201c\nShouta laughs as they continue to walk back to Class 1-A to rejoin his students, ever thankful for his little viper."
