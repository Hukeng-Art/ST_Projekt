    "text": "i.\nKirishima throws an arm around Shouto\u2019s waist which, in itself, is startling enough. The fact that Shouto now finds himself being dragged towards the sofas by said arm whilst Kaminari clings to his back is a whole new level of disconcerting.\nHe had just been about to head to the library, had kept his head down to avoid getting caught up in a conversation, but here he is: Kaminari\u2019s chin digging into his shoulder and Kirishima\u2019s side pressed firmly against his as they herd him away from the door.\nShouto isn't quite sure what to do in this situation besides tense up and try to not outwardly panic as he tries figures out just why his classmates are - he isn't sure if\u00a0hugging him\u00a0is the right way of phrasing it. Kaminari and Kirishima seem to be clinging too tightly for such a word, their grip almost frantic, and he notes that their faces seem panicked.\nHe should probably be more concerned about what\u2019s scared his classmates enough to physically grab him, should be asking them what\u2019s wrong, but all he can bring himself to do is absently scan the room for any kind of threat, mind running a mile a minute as it struggles to process the fact that he\u2019s being... held. Kaminari\u2019s arm is wrapped around his neck and not only is his chest glued to Shouto's back, but it\u2019s also trapping Kirishima's arm between them both. It\u2019s distracting and off putting, and he\u2019s not used to\u00a0this, to the easy affection his classmates show one another.\n\u201cTodoroki,\u201d Kirishima's voice jolts him out of his half-daze, forcing his mind to focus on something other than the way they\u2019d grabbed him so easily. \u201cWhat do you think of Yaoyorozu\u2019s hair?\u201d His voice sounds forcibly cheerful to Shouto\u2019s ears. \u201cIt's nice, right?\u201d\nWhen he looks it\u2019s to see Yaoyorozu sitting on the sofa, her dark eyes big and watery and hands folded neatly in her lap. Her hair, usually long and sleek, now only falls to her shoulders, framing her face in wispy strands. She's surrounded by the rest of the 1-A girls who pause in their conversation to turn around and stare at him.\nShouto blinks, unsure what he\u2019s been dragged into, and stares back with what he hopes is a neutral expression.\n\u201cIt's shorter.\u201d He offers awkwardly when the silence drags on, knowing that his sister always got annoyed at him when he didn\u2019t notice the subtle changes in her appearance.\n(\u201cSubtle?\u201d Fuyumi demanded. \u201cShouto, I've had at least three inches cut off.\u201d)\nHe hopes that'll be the end to it, that his comment will suffice as a compliment, and that he'll be able to head towards the library like he'd originally planned. Unfortunately, Yaoyorozu starts to cry at his words, tears welling over onto her cheeks and breath hitching as she chokes back a sob.\nShouto\u2019s mind blurs a bit as it tries to cope with the fact that not only are two people squeezing closer to him in panic, but he's inadvertently made Yaoyorozu cry. Again.\nHe tries to keep his expression blank to hide just how overwhelmed he feels, heart beating faster and words feeling like ash on his tongue. He must succeed in appearing unpanicked, maybe slightly too well, because Jirou throws him a look that promises a long death.\n\u201cBut it looks nice short! Very nice,\u201d Kaminari\u2019s grip on him has turned into something more like a choke hold, voice desperate as he says, \u201cright, Todoroki?\n\u201cYes.\u201d He feels confused over this whole scenario, something uneasy growing in his stomach.\nIt's a common fact that Shouto isn't good with socialising. His classmates know this, Shouto\u00a0knows\u00a0they know this, because he isn't stupid enough to pretend that he understands half the things they go on about. He doesn't try and force himself to fit in, doesn't try to decipher the conversations he overhears, and instead chooses to keep quiet and observe. And yet, here they are, still trying and get him involved.\nNo matter how confused Shouto gets, no matter how stupid he must keep making himself look, his peers never stop trying to help him. They go out of their way to get him involved with things like\u00a0trip to the mall!\u00a0or\u00a0movie night, Todoroki-kun, we've been through this.\u00a0They keep trying to teach him new phrases and he's always being sent links to internet trends he doesn\u2019t understand. It's utterly exhausting to keep up with.\nHe doesn\u2019t understand this situation right now, probably wouldn\u2019t understand it even if it was explained to him. Years of isolation and only having his father as his main source of social interaction has left him... Different.\nAs to why Kirishima and Kaminari have roped him into helping soothe somebody is anyone's guess. \u201cShort hair is nice.\u201d Shouto continues when Hagakure makes a waving motion behind Yaoyorozu\u2019s back, the gesture frantic. \u201cIt's different, but it's nice.\u201d\n\u201cSee! Even Todoroki thinks it looks nice.\u201d Ashido exclaims, rubbing Yaoyorozu\u2019s arm as she sniffs daintily, long fingers coming up to swipe the tears off her cheeks. \u201cAnd we all know Todoroki can\u2019t lie to save his life.\u201d\nShouto frowns at her words, the phrase\u00a0backhanded compliment\u00a0coming to mind, but he\u2019s not sure whether it applies to this situation or not.\nYaoyorozu lets out a watery smile though, glancing up at him shyly. \u201cYou\u2019re just saying that.\u201d She mutters, cheeks growing red.\n\u201cWell yes.\u201d Todoroki says honestly, eyes widening when Yaoyorozu\u2019s bottom lip starts to wobble again. Kirishima groans in his ear, yanking him away from the sofa with a muttered curse.\n\u201cYou\u2019re terrible at this.\u201d He scolds, fingers tugging Shouto\u2019s earlobe in punishment. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make her feel better.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t even understand why she\u2019s upset.\u201d Shouto whispers back, eyes narrowing at the other boy. \u201cShe got a haircut and what - it made her cry?\u201d\n\u201cTodoroki,\u201d Kaminari whispers, voice long suffering and - fond? Midoriya had tried to teach him about\u00a0fondness\u00a0and\u00a0friendship\u00a0but it\u2019s still something he struggles with. \u201cHer hair got messed up by one of Hatsume\u2019s experiments. She didn't want a haircut, especially not one that looks like\u00a0that.\u201d\nAll three of them twist to see the haircut in question, Tsuyu giving them a\u00a0are you kidding me\u00a0look in the process.\nNow it's been pointed out, Shouto supposes that Yaoyorozu\u2019s haircut may be a bit erratic, especially for someone who values their appearance as much as she does. Black strands of hair fall down in jagged patches, all of them unequal in size, and the left side of her head looks particularly singed. If she hadn\u2019t asked for such a style, then it would explain why she's so upset.\nHe feels frustrated suddenly, both at himself for not realising and, maybe a bit unfairly, at everyone else for forcing him to get involved in this situation. Shouto isn't one to comfort or be comforted. He's not used to all of this, not used to the social interactions expected of him or the way people think they can force the right thing out of him by putting him uncomfortable situations. His childhood of isolation and training has left him reclusive as best and he hates the fact that even now, living away from his father and finding the closest thing he's known to a home at the dorms, the ripples of Endeavours upbringing continue to affect him.\nJirou is still glaring, Shouto notes, as if he has upset Yaoyorozu on purpose, and even Uraraka is looking at him in disbelief. Ashido and Hagakure seem more focused on trying to soothe their friend, voices gentle as they tell her that her hair doesn\u2019t look so bad, that it\u2019s easily fixable, that everything\u2019s going to be okay. They\u2019re lying to her for some reason, they must be, because Yaoyorozu\u2019s hair\u00a0does\u00a0look bad. It\u2019s uneven and messy and he doesn\u2019t understand what telling her otherwise will prove.\nLying has never gotten Shouto anywhere but punished.\nWhether her hair is fixable or not is another matter.\nThere\u2019s a memory in the back of his mind, one of the many that Shouto has shut away and left to be ignored, to be forgotten, and suddenly Fuyumi\u2019s watery voice is echoing around his head as she speaks to their mother.\u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t think.\u201d\u00a0Her voice sniffs.\u00a0\u201cIt was my f-fault, really.\u201d\nTheir father had caught her sneaking in to see Shouto and had lost it, had scolded her for distracting him mid-project, for ruining Shouto\u2019s development, and had then scolded Shouto for letting himself be drawn away from his training. They\u2019d both received a slap in punishment, hard and jarring, and the flames from his father\u2019s costume had brushed both of their hair, the fire angry and almost blue in his rage. It had left them both with singed patches, their hair brittle and burnt where the flames had touched it.\nFuyumi had tried to soothe Shouto\u2019s restrained tears, but she\u2019d been upset herself, hands shaking and eyes wet as she tried to brush down the worst of the burnt bits. Their mother had later found them in the bathroom with Fuyumi trying her best to cut the singed white patches out of Shouto\u2019s hair. She\u2019d paused, eyes sad and then steeled, before she\u2019d taken them to a hairdresser in the town. It\u2019s one of the only times Shouto remembers their mom taking them both out at the same time, his father not a fan of them all being together, let alone out in public.\nThe hairdresser had cut his hair short, an easy fix, but Fuyumi\u2019s hair had been burnt worse. They\u2019d spoken for a long time, long enough for Shouto to have fallen asleep on his mother\u2019s shoulder, but when he\u2019d woken up it had been to Fuyumi\u2019s bright eyes and happy smile, her white hair back to being perfect if not a bit longer than it had been before.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s best you go now, Todoroki.\u201d Jirou snaps, jolting him out of where he\u2019d been staring at Yaoyorozu.\nKaminari loosens his hold and Karishma tugs on his ear one more time, more gently then before, and Shouto takes his chance to escape to the library.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe can\u2019t focus on the research he was meant to be doing, mind filled with his sister\u2019s wobbly voice and Yaoyorozu\u2019s ruined hair.\nHe remembers his sister smiling bright and happily, eyes relieved as she ran her hands through her new hair.\n\n(\u201cHow did they do that?\u201d Shouto asks with wide eyes, hand hesitantly reaching out to brush against the silky looking strands. \u201cIs it a Quirk?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d his mother\u2019s voice said, quiet and amused. \u201cThey\u2019re extensions, Shouto.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re beautiful.\u201d The hairdresser proclaims. \u201cYou look absolutely lovely.\u201d)\n\nBefore Shouto quite knows what he\u2019s doing, his phone is in his hand, book discarded on the table, and his sisters contact information is blinking up at him.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhere are we going Todoroki-kun?\u201d Yaoyorozu sighs for the third time, pulling the hat further down on her head. It\u2019s a silly looking thing, Shouto thinks to himself, a pale purple woollen hat with pompoms dangling down past the ear flaps. \u201cYou said you wanted to go for a walk, not take the train into town just before curfew.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re almost there.\u201d Shouto frowns down at the directions on his screen. \u201cIt\u2019s just a few streets over.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a few streets over?\u201d Yaoyorozu demands, tone exasperated. Todoroki keeps quiet, eyes glued on the screen and strides long. \u201cFine,\u201d she huffs. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me your big secret. If I get in trouble for being out past curfew then I\u2019m putting all the blame on you.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d Shouto says absently, turning them abruptly down a corner. He flicks his eyes around the street, trying to spot the name of the hair salon his sister had found for him. He sees it a few seconds later and crosses over, Yaoyorozu sucking in a breath when she takes note of the direction they\u2019re heading in.\nShe throws him an unreadable look when they pause outside the salon, mouth twisted and eyes hard, but she walks in when Todoroki gestures for her to do so.\n\u201cAh, hello there,\u201d a voice calls to them. Shouto follows it to see a man with bright blue hair and even bluer eyes smiling widely. \u201cIs this my Todoroki appointment?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d Shouto nods politely, ignoring Yaoyorozu\u2019s hissed\u00a0Did you bring me here to watch you get a haircut?\n\u201cI\u2019m Haru.\u201d he tells them as he walks over, pausing in front of Yaoyorozu who stares at him in alarm. \u201cLet\u2019s see what we have here then.\u201d He quickly pulls the hat from her head, ignoring the noise of protest she makes. Yaoyorozu\u2019s hair falls in uneven waves around her face, messy and so very different to what Shouto\u2019s used to seeing. \u201cOh my,\u201d Haru breathes, fingers reaching out to feel the worst of the singed parts. \u201cWhat a mess.\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d Yaoyorozu says in a strained voice. \u201cBut just what is going on here?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to buy groceries.\u201d Shouto says in a deadpan voice, Haru snorting as he fluffs up the hair in his hands.\n\u201cTodoroki,\u201d she huffs. \u201cYou\u2019re not funny.\u201d\n\u201cSurprising the young lady, are we Todoroki-kun?\u201d Haru throws him a bright grin, seeming delighted by this thought. \u201cWhat a lovely gesture.\u201d\nYaoyorozu isn\u2019t stupid, Shouto knows. She knows what they\u2019re here to do or must at least be able to guess. The look she throws him as Haru guides her towards a seat is one Todoroki doesn\u2019t understand. It\u2019s flat yet soft, eyes warm and lips pressed together in a mix of confusion but twitching in - happiness? He isn\u2019t sure, is never too sure, but then he remembers his sisters smiling face all those years ago and decides that he doesn\u2019t need to understand.\nHe sits down in the empty chair beside Yaoyorozu as Haru throws a cape around her neck and fluffs up her hair once more. \u201cNow let\u2019s see what we can do about this, hm? What are we thinking, dear lady?\u201d\nShouto pulls out his phone as Haru and Yaoyorozu start to talk, the sound of their voices and the\u00a0snip\u00a0of the scissors drowning over him.\nWhen he was younger he had never been bothered by his hair. He was always too focused on trying to please his father, forcing himself to practise as hard as he could for both his and his mother\u2019s sake. Something like hair had seemed so insubstantial to him in the long run. When his father had burnt his hair, he\u2019d been more upset that he\u2019d gotten his sister hurt and that she\u2019d been driven close to tears because of him. It still upsets him now, heart beating faster in his chest at the memory. Fuyumi had prioritised Shouto\u2019s own tears over her own regardless, putting him first when she was the one who was more upset by the outcome.\nHis sister lived a different life to him. She knew the bigger world outside of their house and, although secluded, she still had a life away from their home. Fuyumi had places to visit and people to see, had a separated existence to the one Shouto knew. For her, the burnt and tattered state of her hair had been deeply upsetting. She liked looking after herself, held her own image with pride, and to see her almost crying was something that never left his mind. Fuyumi wasn\u2019t one to cry. None of them were, not really.\nThe salon they visited all those years ago had been able to fix her brittle and burnt hair and to see both his mother and sister smiling in the same room as each other was a memory he treasured.\nTo see Yaoyorozu crying over her hair, to see singed ends and watery eyes - well, it seemed like such a simple solution to get it fixed for her.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not until they\u2019re outside the salon, the sky dark above them and the street lights illuminating the roads below, that Shouto worries that he may have made a mistake.\nYaoyorozu\u2019s hair is similar to how it was before, falling down to mid-back in a shimmering sheet, her natural hair being cut and blended in with the extensions. The hairdresser - Haru - had done her justice, just like the woman had with his sister all those years ago.\nYaoyorozu didn\u2019t seem to know how to deal with Shouto after he refused to let her pay. She\u2019d been quiet and gentle and, after they\u2019d started to walk back to the train station, her eyes had started to water.\n\u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201d He asks unsurely. He thought that Yaoyorozu had been upset about her shorter hair- had even been told as much- but now doubt starts to gnaw at him. Shouto isn\u2019t good with emotions, isn\u2019t good with other people, and he wouldn\u2019t be surprised to find that he\u2019s misread the entire situation and made things worse.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Yaoyorozu sniffs. She swipes at her eyes, a smile crossing her face. \u201cOf course you haven\u2019t done anything wrong, Todoroki-kun.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re crying.\u201d He points out hesitantly. He hasn\u2019t seen anybody bar Midoriya cry and smile at the same time and he isn\u2019t sure what it means.\n\u201cI\u2019m happy.\u201d She says, dimples appearing in her cheeks. \u201cThese are happy tears.\u201d\n\u201cHappy tears.\u201d Shouto repeats with a frown.\n\u201cYeah, Todoroki-kun.\u201d She nudges their shoulders together as they walk. \u201cYou\u2019ve made me happy.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d\u00a0Thank god.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s okay then.\u201d\nShe snorts at that, fingers coming up to wipe at her cheeks again. \u201cYou don\u2019t even realise what you\u2019ve done, do you?\u201d\n\u201cI got your hair fixed for you.\u201d Shouto states, tensing when Yaoyorozu grabs his elbow and pulls him to a gentle stop. \u00a0\n\u201cNot just that.\u201d She looks happy, soft and kind, and yet a bit sad at the same time. \u201cWhat you did just now was really nice. Unbelievably so.\u201d\n\u201cGood?\u201d He\u2019d meant for it to come out as a statement but it ends up sounding more like a question. He\u2019s confused as to what Yaoyorozu is trying to get at. It had been such an easy problem for him to fix, a problem that resonated in his own heart, and to just ignore the issue when he knew the solution seemed stupid.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do it, you realise? You especially didn\u2019t have to pay.\u201d\n\u201cIs that what you\u2019re upset about?\u201d He blinks, feeling uncertain. \u201cBecause if you want to pay then you can, but it was technically my old man's money and he\u2019s- he can afford it.\u201d\nHis mother had paid for their haircuts, all those years ago, out of the meagre stash of yen she had saved up. His father had found out about it soon after, having caught sight Fuyumi\u2019s long shiny hair, and the outcome had been-\n(horrible yet\u00a0normal\u00a0- his father's flaming hand slamming the door in Shouto\u2019s face, something finite and deafening from the\u00a0bang\u00a0as his mother\u2019s cries were abruptly cut off.)\n-yet another dent in his wilting heart.\n\u201cAh, no.\u201d She stares into his eyes and her smile grows into something more understanding, more gentle. \u201cI\u2019m touched that you\u2019ve done this. I\u2019m really grateful.\u201d\nTouched.\u00a0He\u2019d have to ask Midoriya to remind him about the word when they were back at the dorms.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, it-\u201d\n\n(reminded me of time my dad hit my sister for sneaking in to see me. Her hair had gotten caught in his flames and had burnt, had become brittle and broken and-\n\n\nIt reminded me of the time she almost cried. My mother got in trouble for making her happy again and-)\n\n\u201c-really isn\u2019t that big of a deal.\u201d\nShe frowns at him as Shouto once again seems to miss the point she\u2019s trying to make. The silence stretches for a beat too long and Shouto\u2019s just about ready to start walking again, ready to leave the confusion and the conversation behind him, but before he can he suddenly finds himself with a face full of hair.\nHe blinks once, twice, but the long dark strands don\u2019t stop tickling the side of his face. Gentle arms are wrapped around his shoulders and his chin is resting on Yaoyorozu\u2019s shoulder, body being tugged down by her surprisingly strong arms.\n\u201cThank you, Todoroki-kun.\u201d She says quietly. Shouto blinks again, body tense and arms hanging uselessly by his sides, as his brain turns into a confused static.\nAfter all this time he's still not used to the touching, to the gentleness everybody shows him, and it leaves him - not uncomfortable, but lost. It leaves him aching and yearning, desperate for more and yet so overwhelmed by such simple actions.\nYaoyorozu pulls back, not seeming to mind how edgy he is. She doesn\u2019t seem to care about the blatant issue he has when it comes to touching, when it comes to his issue of not knowing how to hug, and offers him a kind smile when he blinks at her.\n\u201cYou really are sweet, you know?\u201d She brushes her hand through her extensions, face warm and - touched, whatever that means. She watches Shouto like the static running through his head isn't abnormal, like the way he is isn't a cause for concern. \u201cIf you ever need to talk, we can.\u201d\nWhat is happening\u00a0he wants to ask as Yaoyorozu starts walking again.\u00a0What do you mean by that?\nHe can\u2019t get his mouth to work though, words and thoughts blossoming within him but clogging his insides instead of sprouting free.\nHe'd only fixed her problem because it was such an easy thing for him to do. Yaoyorozu shouldn't have to be upset over her hair, not when Shouto knew a way to fix it, not when it was ruined in such an unfair manner. He doesn't want her thanks, isn't sure what to do with it, and it hangs over him, taunting and terrifying.\nHe doesn't understand. He doesn't think he will ever understand.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey get in long past curfew.\nShouto expects the common area to be empty but there\u2019s a surprising amount of people hanging about, seemingly waiting for Yaoyorozu to come back if the way they perk up at her entrance is anything to go by.\n\u201cMomo where have you- oh.\u201d Jirou\u2019s voice cuts off abruptly as Ashido and Uraraka let out squeals of joy. \u201cOh wow.\u201d\nShouto keeps his gaze fixed to the floor as he makes his way towards the elevator, not wanting to get involved in any other conversations. His daily\u00a0emotion-related-confusion\u00a0has exceeded its limit for at least the remainder of the week and all he wants to do is go to bed and sleep.\nHis classmates, regrettably, seem to have other plans and Shouto tries his best not to flinch when his arm is grabbed unexpectedly.\n\u201cSorry.\u201d Jirou\u2019s voice says. When he looks up it\u2019s to see her holding her hands up in a placating gesture, as if Shouto\u2019s some sort of startled rabbit, which, he supposes, isn\u2019t entirely untrue.\n\u201cDid you want something?\u201d Shouto asks, hoping whatever this is will be short.\n\u201cI just wanted to say thank you.\u201d Jirou fiddles with her ear, offering him a kind, genuine smile. \u201cFor what you\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d He returns tiredly, shoulders slumping.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t?\u201d Jirou looks like she wants to reach out again but thankfully she doesn\u2019t, choosing to cross her arms and raise an eyebrow at him instead. \u201cSo, it wasn\u2019t you who not only cheered Momo up, but also fixed what was upsetting her in the first place?\u201d\n\u201cI was just-\u201d\n\u201cDid you not,\" She continues over the top of him. \"Just break curfew to make her happier?\u201d\n\u201cI mean-\u201d\n\u201cAre you trying to be humble?\u201d Jirou tuts. \u201cOr are you just really that stupid.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not stupid.\u201d Shouto mutters. He does feel stupid, though, always a few steps behind when it comes to other people. He doesn\u2019t want their thanks in the same way he never wanted his sister to get hurt because of him.\n\n(\u201cYou\u2019re my brother. I know we haven\u2019t had the best relationship but I wanna try - I don\u2019t know. I just want to try being a family, I guess.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFamily.\u201d Shouto repeats thickly.\n\n\n\u201cYeah. I want to help you, Sho. Me, you and Natsu - I want us to get out of here for good.\u201d)\n\nFuyumi will never stop protecting him. Shouto doesn\u2019t understand why and can\u2019t bring himself to ask her to explain it to him - but he knows that she\u2019ll never stop.\nIn the same sense he imagines that\u2019s why his classmates always keep trying with him, their patience and kindness seeming limitless. Shouto is different but they all seem to be okay with the fact - seem to like him regardless - and maybe that\u2019s just another thing he\u2019s going to have to accept.\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Jirou repeats firmly. \u201cFor making her happy.\u201d\nShouto presses his lips together but doesn\u2019t shrug off her thanks this time, eyes trailing over to where Yaoyorozu is being fawned over by the rest of the 1-A girls plus Midoriya, Kaminari, and Iida. They all look happy - Yaoyorozu especially - and it makes something in him feel soft. It makes him feel warm and happy and tired.\nAn arm\u2019s thrown around his shoulders, making him stiffen again, but Shouto let\u2019s himself be tugged sideways as Kirishima grins at him. \u201cClever boy,\u201d the older boy praises, fingers finding Shouto\u2019s ear and tugging it gently. \u201cNever thought you had it in you, Icy-hot.\u201d\n\u201cHad what in me?\u201d Jirou snorts at his question, growing more comfortable with Kirishima\u2019s added presence.\n\u201cA heart.\u201d Kirishima teases. \u201cMr-I\u2019m-not-pretending-to-be-anyone\u2019s-friend.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t call me that.\u201d Shouto mutters, the reminder of his statement before the sports festival making him blush. He looks at where Midoriya is combing his fingers through Yaoyorozu\u2019s hair with big eyes, Uraraka and Ashido standing behind him with wide smiles, and lets himself relax slightly. He thinks of his sister - of all his siblings, of his mother - stepping in to protect him and wishing he could protect them in return. He thinks of what he\u2019d do if their positions were reversed, if it was Fuyumi with the hybrid powers instead of him. \u201cI didn\u2019t do it for her.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be dramatic.\u201d Kirishima tuts. \u201cYou\u2019re allowed to show that you care sometimes, Todoroki-kun\u201d\nMidoriya catches his eye across the room and gives him a smile, something so warm and bright that the frozen parts inside of him melt even further. He looks proud, Shouto thinks, as if Shouto\u2019s done something that Midoriya is particularly happy about. He adds it to the growing list of things that have had confused him today.\n\u201cCan I go to bed now?\u201d He asks, feeling more tired than he had earlier.\nJirou and Kirishima share a look and he can see her shrug, can feel the way Kirishima\u2019s arm tightens around him in response before he lets go.\n\u201cSure.\u201d Jirou says. She does reach out this time, hand barely touching his shoulder before she pulls it away. \u201cThanks again, Todoroki.\u201d\nOne day, Shouto thinks when he\u2019s lying in bed, he\u2019ll learn to accept the way people treat him here.\nHe\u2019ll learn to accept the touches for what they are, will accept the fact that people can be kind and gentle without expecting things in return.\nOne day.\nii.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAfter the hair incident, all of his classmates start to act differently towards him.\nAt first, he thinks nothing of it, thinks that maybe he should've expected the 1-A girls to treat him more nicely, to smile and bound up to him as if Shouto was one of them.\nIt was okay at first too, manageable, but then everybody else started to join in as well. All of 1-A suddenly take a new interest in him, offering him help with homework and wanting him to join them for lunch and- well, it's a nice change, maybe. It's fine. Shouto isn't quite sure what to do with everything they're offering\u00a0and it's fine, sure, but it could be more fine if-\nIf. It would be okay, maybe, should be okay, but.\nThe thing is, people keep touching him.\nIt\u2019s nothing weird, he doesn\u2019t think. To him it\u2019s strange, foreign, but he\u2019s been around the class long enough to see that all of them are used to skinship and closer contact.\nShouto can count on his fingers the number of times he\u2019d been touched with kind intent after his mother had been taken away. It\u2019s a depressingly small amount and a majority of those incidents had been Fuyumi smoothing his hair back to place a plaster on his forehead or pulling him in for a quick, tight, hug before their father separated them once again.\nBut now, as if Shouto taking Yaoyorozu out was some sort of sign, his class start treating him - he doesn\u2019t want to say more kindly, because it\u2019s not like they didn\u2019t treat him kindly before. Maybe it\u2019s more like they\u2019ve stopped holding themselves back from what they\u2019re used to doing, have decided to reach out towards him and ignore how frosty he can get.\nSero will nudge their shoulders together when they\u2019re standing near each other in class. Soji has started offering one of his hands out for a high five whenever Jirou sasses Bakugou.\nIf Shouto scores well on a test or does something his classmates find particularly clever during training they\u2019ll pat him on the back or squeeze his shoulder, crowding close and smiling wide.\nIt's different and he isn't sure where to look when he's surrounded by so much kindness, isn't sure what to do with the warm feeling inside of him. The feeling is so different to his fire, something more wholesome and good then the harsh heat of what he\u2019s used to, and it confuses him to the point where Shouto finds it easier to ignore than acknowledge.\nIt becomes harder to ignore though, one week of the new affection falling into two and then by the third-\nKirishima and Kaminari like to cling, Shouto has found out. They're all arms and hanging off Shouto as if he\u2019s some kind of gloried climbing frame, whereas the girls like to squeeze his elbows and tug him along by his wrists.\nThere are hands on his back and fingers squeezing his and it\u2019s all so friendly, so gentle and kind, and it\u2019s all just too much.\nIt\u2019s too much.\nWhat Shouto thought was overwhelming before seems like nothing in comparison to what\u2019s happening now. His brain can\u2019t keep up with it all and Shouto finds himself flinching back from the offered hands before he can stop himself, body tensing and skin itching, tingling.\nThe worst thing is that a part of him doesn\u2019t want them to stop. He likes the hugs, likes the affection, and something desperate wells up in him when it happens, when it continues to happen regardless to how twitchy he gets.\nThe issue, he's found, seems to stem from him not knowing how to deal with wanting something so badly and having it given to him, no questions asked.\nShouto\u2019s trained his whole life, has been taken away from what other people consider normal to be put through his father's version of hero training, his father's version of his childhood, and it\u2019s left him lonely and weird and different. \nHis father had handed him things on a golden platter: recommendations for Yuuei, the chance to train his Quirk beyond his entire classes capabilities, money and material things Shouto\u2019s never had any desire for.\nHe has always wanted to earn his place in the hero world, wanted to work to rebuild the relationship with his mother, wanted to be his own version of best. He wants to be Shouto.\n\n(\u201cIt\u2019s yours! Your Quirk - not his!\u201d)\n\nSo maybe the issue comes down to the fact that, not only is Shouto unused to the affectionate touches, but that he also feels like he\u2019s undeserving of them.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cAlright?\u201d Ashido asks, falling down on the sofa beside him. It\u2019s not close enough for them to touch, but it\u2019s close enough for Shouto to be acutely aware of the heat radiating off of her, his icy side more vulnerable to temperatures than his left. \u201cWhat are we brooding over?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not brooding.\u201d Shouto says. He doesn\u2019t brood, he just - thinks. Contemplates.\n\u201cSure.\u201d She agrees easily, bumping their shoulders together in apparent friendliness. Shouto can\u2019t wrap his head around the action. \u201cWanna come down town with the rest of us?\u201d\n\u201cGo into town?\u201d Shouto frowns at her, mind recalling Aizawa's new stricter curfew. \u201cIs that allowed?\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t seem to care much about whether it was allowed or not the other day,\u201d Ashido wiggles her eyebrows at him, dark eyes bright and glittery. She\u2019s referring to the hair incident again, something that everybody likes to bring up to him.\nThey bring it up as if it\u2019ll reveal some hidden part of him, something kind and smiling and thoughtful. They don\u2019t seem to understand his reasoning behind why he did what he did and he isn\u2019t willing to try and explain it to them, not when the words escape him, when the truth isn't what they want to hear.\nOn the flip side of the coin, Shouto imagines it's like the way he can\u2019t understand them, how he can\u2019t wrap his head around their gentle affections and clingyness, and how he refuses to ask about it. How they couldn\u2019t explain it to him, even if he did ask.\nHe gives Ashido a carefully blank look, feigning ignorance to the point she's trying to make, which she pouts at. \u201cFine- fine!\u201d she flaps a hand at him, long blue nails brushing his arm. \u201cYes, we\u2019re allowed to go.\u201d\nShouto considers staying at the dorms, considers being left alone without any of his classmates pestering him or knocking on his door just to say hi, dude, duh. He thinks about having his own space and his own time and it makes him feel considerably more lonely.\n\u201cI\u2019ll come with you.\u201d he decides, tensing up when Ashido claps her hands and presses their arms together in celebration, body leaning close to his and her\u00a0tangy and sweet perfume invading his senses.\n\u201cCome on then.\u201d She jumps up from the sofa and doesn\u2019t hesitate to pull Shouto up with her. \u201cLet\u2019s go now before you change your mind.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEveryone, as it turns out, consists of Ashido, Uraraka, Kirishima, Kaminari, Iida, and Midoriya.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think Ashido would be able to convince you to come\u00a0with us.\u201d Uraraka comments as they make their way to the train station. \u201cI thought we\u2019d have to send Deku in to drag you out.\u201d\nShouto blinks at her, feeling like there\u2019s more to what she\u2019s just said, especially when Midoriya flushes and hits her arm with a hissed \"shut it\".\n\u201cTodoroki-kun loves me.\u201d Ashido says, still clinging from Shouto\u2019s arm. \u201cHe thinks I\u2019m very charming, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cI think you\u2019re annoying.\u201d He tells her honestly. He also thinks that she\u2019s kind and brave, but he doesn\u2019t feel the need to admit that to her.\n\u201cTodoroki-kun,\u201d Iida scolds as Kirishima lets out a startled laugh. \u201cDon\u2019t be rude.\u201d\nShouto sniffs, biting back an amused smile.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like being with Bakugou.\u201d Ashido complains, finally detaching herself from Shouto to throw her arm around Kaminari\u2019s shoulders instead. \u201cYou\u2019re both so mean to me and all I do is shower you in love and friendship.\u201d\n\u201cI only want to be showered in water.\u201d Shouto says flippantly, feeling pleased when Kirishima laughs even harder.\n\u201cYou tell her, Todoroki.\u201d the red haired boy crows. He then half falls over himself as he reaches a hand out to give Shouto a high five which, by now, is to be expected, but the sight of a hand coming towards him quick and fast is also expected, and he tenses out of instinct.\nHe controls his flinch but they\u2019d all have to be blind not to see how wired his muscles suddenly are, how stotic his face is, and how Midoriya is now hovering next to him, giving Kirishima a hard look. Things don\u2019t go silent - everybody still chattering, still walking onward - but Shouto can feel how things have suddenly shifted, and he feels stupid. Embarrassed.\nThis thing they all do, the easy contact and simple actions, is just so bewildering. So exhausting. It leaves him confused and lost, the ripples of Endeavor\u2019s upbringing apparent and harsh in their reminder that he\u2019s not used to anything like this.\nHe\u2019s used to blocking the hits his father threw his way during their training, used to ducking and rolling and keeping quiet as to not draw any unwanted attention towards himself.\nBeing around other people reminds him that the way he was raised wasn\u2019t normal - isn\u2019t normal still, maybe.\nKirishima, though, kind and patient Kirishima, who doesn\u2019t seem to mind Shouto\u2019s barely there flinches, keeps his hand in the air and stares at Shouto with a genuine smile, eyes kind and waiting.\nHe high fives the other boy back, motion slightly awkward because he still can't quite grasp the purpose of hitting someone else's hand out of happiness, but Kirishima flashes his teeth in a bigger grin before he goes back over to tease Ashido.\n\u201cOkay?\u201d Midoriya asks from his side, peering up at Shouto curiously.\nThe older boy has turned out to be very observant to Shouto\u2019s moods and his reactions, Midoriya somehow being even more understanding than the rest of the class when it comes to dealing with him.\nMaybe that's because Shouto had told him about his past, had confessed his ugly secrets in the hopes that the other boy would be able to understand why Shouto is the way he is, would be able to understand something that even Shouto can\u2019t quite wrap his head around. Or maybe, Shouto thinks, Midoriya staring at him in honest concern, it\u2019s because the other boy just genuinely cares.\nMaybe he just likes Shouto for Shouto.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d He confirms, heart fluttering in his chest. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\nMidoriya\u2019s returning grin is small and pure, honest in the other boys happiness, and Shouto doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll ever understand how he managed to become friends with these sorts of people. With good people.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs Shouto has just come along for the company, no real intention or need to buy anything, he finds himself dubbed Bag Man by almost everyone after they visit the first shop.\n\u201cYou can tell them no,\u201d Iida reminds him as Shouto fits a sixth shopping bag on his arm. \u201cThey\u2019re strong enough to shop and carry around everything they buy.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Shouto says, trailing alongside Iida as Kaminari, Ashido and Uraraka race into a store that claims to sell Homemade and Organic Bath bombs! \u201cI don\u2019t mind carrying their stuff.\u201d\nIida hums doubtfully. \u201cI could take some bags as well.\u201d\n\u201cYou have your own stuff.\u201d Shouto points out, nodding his head towards the few bags Iida\u2019s long fingers are curled around. \u201cAnd again, I really don\u2019t mind carrying their things.\u201d\nHe won't admit it aloud in fear or being laughed at, but carrying everybody's shopping is the perfect level of being involved\u00a0for him. He hadn\u2019t needed anything from the mall and, unlike Kirishima and Midoriya, he wasn\u2019t willing to try on the outfits that the girls picked out for him. Holding everyone\u2019s bags kept him both in the loop of what was happening and made him useful. It makes him accompanying everyone here not so pointless.\n(It makes him not so pointless, makes his company worth something.)\n\u201cAt least let me buy you a drink in thanks,\u201d Iida says. \u201cOn their behalf.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your stuff I'm carrying.\u201d Shouto frowns at him. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t need to be thanked for this.\u201d\n\u201cTea, then?\u201d Iida says, ignoring Shouto\u2019s argument completely. \u201cOr maybe just a soda - no, you\u2019re right, we can get soda any day.\u201d\n\u201cI didn't say anything.\u201d Shouto says blankly, feeling a bit lost. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to buy me anything.\u201d\n\u201cI hear there\u2019s a new bubble tea place on the level up if you fancy it?\u201d\n\u201cBubble tea?\u201d Shouto blinks, glancing around desperately in the hopes of finding Midoriya. The older boy has become Shouto's own personal hero when it comes to understanding what his classmates are trying to achieve with their conversations, with their actions.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve never had bubble tea?\u201d Iida looks surprised, tilting his head and staring at Shouto with a sudden determined expression. \u201cThat\u2019s it settled then. We\u2019ll go get some right now.\u201d\nBefore Shouto can protest the taller boy is already flagging down Kirishima.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\u00a0The other boy\u00a0asks as he walks over. \u201cYou lose everybody else?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re in there.\u201d Iida points to the brightly coloured shop behind them. \u201cAnd we,\u201d he gestures to where Shouto is standing next to him, arms overflowing with bags, \u201care going to grab a drink.\u201d\n\u201cOh sweet, dude.\u201d Kirishima holds up a bag in his hand and Shouto walks over to take it question. \u201cI want to see what they do in there too - I saw this picture online where they have this one thing that'll turn the entire water black which totally has Tokoyami written all over it, right?\" Shouto has no idea what the other boy is talking about, feeling more confused by the second. He offers a nod which appeases Kirishima though, the other boy nodding in return with a grin, \"So I'll go find that,\u00a0and we\u2019ll meet you up there after?\u201d\n\u201cSure. If you have to, then come come find us.\u201d Iida sighs, crossing his arms over his chest. Shouto blinks, unsure if the other boy is mad, but he sees Iida\u2019s lips twitch slightly and Kirishima seems at ease with it, snorting and flipping the other boy off.\n\u201cLike you wouldn\u2019t want us up there.\u201d Midoriya says from behind Shouto, making all of them jump slightly. Shouto twitches especially hard, eyes wide as they stare down at the older boy.\n\u201cGeez,\u201d Midoriya reaches out to squeeze Shouto's arm, \u202fthe action seeming automatic on the other boys part. His hand is delightfully warm and stable, his fingers curling around Shouto\u2019s bicep. \u201cCalm down, you scaredy cats.\u201d\n\u201cScared?\u201d Kirishima scoffs, puffing up his chest as the same time Iida scolds, \u201cdon\u2019t sneak up on people, Midoriya-san.\u201d\nMidoriya snickers, hand still warm on his arm which is - well, which is making his mind go a bit fuzzy, if he\u2019s honest, the world blurring around how softly Midoriya is touching him, how strong the other boy is, how-\n\u201c-go and find a glittery one for Aoyama.\u201d Shouto\u2019s arm still burns when Midoriya lets go, the other boy giving Shouto a smile before he heads off into the shop with Kirishima by his side.\n\u201cWe can get a pink one for Bakugou as well!\u201d Kirishima says in bright voice, Midoriya's laughter ringing in his ears.\n\u201cLet\u2019s leave those idiots to it, hey?\u201d Iida asks, rolling his eyes when Uraraka\u2019s high pitched, bubbly laugh comes from the open doors.\nShouto follows Iida on instinct, still a bit confused by how this day has turned out.\n\u201cIida-san,\u201d he tries again when they\u2019re on the escalators heading up. \u201cYou really don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d\n\u201cNonsense,\u201d Iida flaps a hand at him as if he can physically brush Shouto\u2019s words away. \u201cI\u2019ll buy you as many drinks as I want, Todoroki-kun.\u201d\nThat statement throws Shouto off more than ever, mind reeling as he absently trails behind the taller boy through the crowds. Why would Iida offer to buy him a drink in thanks when Shouto hasn\u2019t even done anything worth thanking?\nThey walk into the busy tea shop then and Shouto still doesn't feel certain about letting Iida but him a drink, but he doesn't want to come across as rude, doesn't want to keep arguing and fighting against such a kind gesture.\nSo, when Iida asks him what flavour bubbles he wants, he bites back the why are you doing this, and instead replies with, \u201cThe same as you, please.\u201d\n\u201cThe same as me.\u201d Iida repeats a bit blankly. He blinks at Shouto, eyes watching him closely, and one eyebrow raises as he says in an amused tone, \u201cYou aren't just saying that to be polite, are you?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Shouto insists. He doesn't even know what bubble tea is, let alone the different flavours of it, so sticking with whatever Iida goes for is his safest option. \u201cI want the same as you.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you didn't like bananas.\" Iida pushes his glasses up with his index finger, a knowing smile curling at his lips.\nShouto wants to protest, wants to say that he's happy with whatever the older boy has, regardless of flavours, but the thing is that Iida's right. Shouto hates bananas.\nHe can't stand the taste or the smell, isn't too keen on their yellow colour and the way it fades into a rotten brown as time goes on. The shape of them is odd and they taste both too bland and too sweet at the same time, let alone what that'd taste like in artificial flavouring. The texture of the fruit is also disgusting, mushy and a bit slimy and-\nHe can feel his face screwing up at the thought of them, nose scrunching and lips pinching, making Iida snort. \"That's what I thought.\" Iida says in a fond voice. The taller boy looks pleased too, as if knowing Shouto's likes and dislikes is something worthy of knowing, and he can feel his face get hot under the attention.\u00a0\nShouto hadn't thought people had noticed, if he's being honest.\n\u201cWe do other flavours.\u201d the bored sounding girl behind the till drawls. \u201cAll up on the board.\u201d\nShe gestures behind her to where a list of different flavours sit and he feels a bit overwhelmed with it all, a bit stupid and a lot uncomfortable, especially with being put on the spot so suddenly. He falters, shoulders hunching as he tries to quickly scan through the menu.\nThe issue is he doesn't know what he wants, has no idea what will taste nice or what's the best option, and after a few minutes of him looking, the girl starts to look annoyed. Her dark eyes flick to the growing queue behind them and Shouto regrets trying to be polite, wishing that he'd never agreed to let Iida buy him anything.\nHis fingers twitch, body feeling suddenly too hot, and all he wants to turn around and walk out. He wants to leave and keep leaving until he's far away from the mall and the crowds and the noise and bright lights and the-\n\u201cStrawberry and cream.\u201d A long arm wraps itself around his shoulders and tugs him in, cutting through his haze of panic.\nShouto blinks up at Iida but the other boy is looking at the cashier, nodding to whatever she's saying. His thumb rubs soothingly behind Shouto's ear though, the pressure just enough to make his hands stop shaking, and he finds himself sagging into Iida\u2019s side.\nThere's still movement around them, fast and heavy and very much the opposite of what Shouto is used to, but Iida is tall, is muscled and strong and familiar.\nShouto feels like if he wanted to, he could hide behind the older boy. Shouto could press himself to Iida's back and drop his head onto the other boys shoulder and he knows that nobody would be able to see him.\nThe thought alone is comforting enough and he slots himself more firmly into Iida's side, ducking his head and staring at the bags in his hands instead of his surroundings.\nA cup is passed to him with his drink inside - something pink and pretty looking with whipped cream melting into it from the top.\n\u201cWant to take these outside?\u201d Iida asks him.\nHe doesn't say are you okay sitting in here, doesn't say do you need us to find somewhere quieter. He doesn't point out that Shouto has an obvious disdain to large pulsing crowds, doesn't point out that Shouto's half melded into his side right now.\nIida is offering him an out without outwardly questioning Shouto, without making him feel stupid, and it's that what makes his lips twitch up in a small smile as he meets Iida\u2019s eyes.\n\u201cInside is cool.\u201d he says honestly. Shouto doesn't want to let his issue with crowds grow into something bigger, not when he's training to be a hero of all things. With Iida by his side, thumb still brushing at the spot behind his ear and a kind, earnest expression on his face, Shouto thinks that he can ignore the crowds around them.\u00a0\n\u201cCome on then.\u201d Iida uses his arm to steer them towards a small empty booth, keeping Shouto tucked in close and letting him climb in first.\nHe expects Iida to climb into the booth opposite him but the taller boy doesn't. Instead, he grabs the bags from Shouto and places them on the opposite seat before-\nSomething warm grows in him when Iida slots in besides him without question, his large shoulders blocking Shouto from the crowds as he twists to face him.\nHe doesn't know what to do with the emotion, with the pressure that builds behind his ribs, but he wishes he could feel like this more often.\n\u201cGood?\u201d Iida asks, nodding his head towards Shouto's drink. They both know Shouto hasn't taken a sip, that what he's really asking is is this okay now? Are you okay?\nThe spot behind his ear burns where Iida\u2019s thumb had dug in, his shoulders and side warm and tingling from where the other boy was pressed against him. He still isn't used to such kind touches, to such gentle affections and soft actions, but he thinks that he could grow used to it, maybe.\u00a0\nHe could grow used to being touched, could grow used to being hugged.\n\u201cIt's good.\u201d Shouto agrees quietly, bringing his drink to his lips and taking a sip through the straw. A bubble lands in his mouth and when he pops it flavour bursts over his tongue - sweet and sharp and thick with the added cream.\nIida\u2019s expression softens a bit and Shouto offers him another smile, small and honest.\u202f\u201cReally good. Thank you Iida-san.\u201d\niii.\n\u00a0\nShouto stays at Yuuei during the summer.\nHis father had tried to fight it, but all his fight had receded in the fear of publically causing a scene. In publically showing off his true colours.\nAbove all else, Endeavor respects the family name. It hurts more than he wants to admit that his father still chooses the name\u00a0Todoroki over Shouto, but he's not surprised. Not any more.\nOn the flip side, he\u2019s so grateful that Aizawa willingly used his father's image against him, that Endeavor caved in at the thought of the Todoroki name being slandered in the press, of his image being tainted in the public eye.\nIn the long run Shouto imagines Aizawa stepping in so ruthlessly may cause him more pain then it\u2019s worth, but for now nothing happens. Or will happen, if he's to belive his sisters words. Endeavor is trying to prove a point, apparently.\n(\u201cI\u2019ll let you have this, Shouto.\u201d Endeavor says into the quietness of Aizawa\u2019s classroom. Shouto won't look up from the floor, petulantly refusing to meet his father's gaze. From besides him he can feel Aizawa shift, his teachers hand pressing firmly into the middle of his back in silent support. \u201cI\u2019ll let you stay here.\u201d\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Shouto says stiffly, trying to ignore the panic that claws at his stomach and the hope that swirls so closely behind it.\n\u201cBut in return-\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Aizawa steps in, voice hard. \u201cThank you for agreeing to this, but I won't allow you to blackmail my students.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s my son,\u201d Endeavor points out. He sounds like he\u2019s trying convince everyone in the room and himself.\nShouto can feel his father's gaze on his face, hard and burning. Pleading. \u201cYou\u2019re my son, Shouto.\u201d Endeavor sounds more desperate then firm. \u201cAnd I\u2019m letting you stay because I care, okay?\u201d\nShouto doesn\u2019t ever think he'll ever be okay with his father or with the redemption act he\u2019s trying to pull. He presses his lips together, silently begging his father to leave, for Aizawa to make this meeting end.\n\u201cIf that\u2019s all,\u201d Aizawa prompts. \u201cToshinori will happily escort you off campus.\u201d\n\u201cHappily.\u201d All Might repeats charmingly.\n\u201cRemember this.\u201d Endeavor continues, directing his words at Shouto and Shouto alone. They burn, slightly. They make something in him churn, flashes of his past making him suck in a sharp breath. \u201cShouto,\u201d his father sounds like he's going to say something painful, something that Shouto doesn't want to hear and something that Endeavour needs to say, but in the end all that comes out of his father's mouth is, \u201cwrite to me this summer if you\u2019re not too busy.\u201d\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Shouto repeats. Aizawa\u2019s hand squeezes his shoulder and he can hear Toshinori open the door but his father's gaze still hangs over him, looms over him.\nHe doesn\u2019t know what his father wants from him, not really. But in this rare act of kindness he knows better than to be anything but polite. \u201cI\u2019ll try and write if I can.\u201d)\nAnd so here he is, in the familiarity of the dorms, the safety of school. Is odd not having his classmates around, everything seeming bigger and the emptiness following him around at night.\nAfter the first day, though, Aizawa sets up camp in one of the spare rooms the dorm has to offer and Toshinori never really seems to leave. Present Mic also starts dropping by every other day to join them dinner and it's--\nNice.\nIt's a nice routine to find himself in. It's something Shouto never thought he'd have and he feels more relaxed the first week into this summer then he ever has during a break before.\nMidoriya sends him a picture of a magazine article a few nights later.\n\n Endeavor - Sun, Sea, and his Son\u2019s Secret Summer Training? \n\n\nIn a recent interview with number one hero Endeavor, we find out how his new number one career is going, a few secrets to how he stays so strong (and handsome!), and just why his son, Todoroki Shouto, is staying at Yuuei this summer! \n\nHe\u2019s tempted to close the image, shut down his computer, and crawl into bed, but Midoriya sent it to him and, well. Midoriya sent it to him. So he reads it and snorts when he sees the annotations scrawled all over it.\n\nInterviewer: So, Endeavor. Rumours have it that your son Shouto has chosen to stay at his school instead of coming home. Is this true? \n\nEndeavour: Yes, the rumours are true. Shouto has chosen to stay at Yuuei over summer with my blessing, it reads. Then, in short, neat, and familiar handwriting, the words \u2018#blessedByEndeavor\u2019 sit in black sharpie.\nI was hesitant at first, but after many family summers together (\u2018I\u2019d rather spend summer with my aunt then your father and we both know that\u2019s really saying something\u2019) I\u2019m more than happy to let my son stay at the Yuuei campus. (\u2018Not as happy as me (\uff3e\u25bd\uff3e)\u2019)\nThere\u2019s an old picture of Shouto from when he was twelve, eyes a bit wider and cheeks still round with puppy fat. Shouto has no idea where the magazine company found it, but he notices that Midoriya has drawn a flower in his hair and a cat nose on his face, whiskers adorning each cheek, with the captain \u2018kitten shouto!!!!\u2019 next to it. It makes no sense at all, really, but Shouto finds himself smiling stupidly at it nonetheless.\nIt's nice to see him so eager to learn, the article continues. He's just like me in that sense. He's going to receive extra training from his teachers whilst he's there, making him ahead of the game for next term. (\u2018extra! training! Do they only offer this to the cutest boys in class? (*\u30fb\u2200-)\u2606\u2019\nShouto stares at the comment for a while, rereading the words carefully and hoping he can remember them forever.\nHe feels warmth spreading inside of his chest, a bit put out but yet stupidly happy, even as blood rushes to his cheeks.\nMidoriya thinks he's cute.)\n\nI'm sure he'll also be sticking to the training regime I taught him. He's promised to keep in close contact with me too. \n\nIn the end, the article mostly consists of weird Endeavor facts and another section on how he approves of Shouto\u2019s eagerness to train over summer. It\u2019s boastful and total bullshit, but Midoriya\u2019s commentary makes it bearable and, he reluctantly admits, enjoyable.\n\nShouto 19:08\n\nNice.

Shouto isn\u2019t sure why that\u2019s so surprising to him, but for some reason it is.\nIt might be because he's never actually been on a beach day before, especially not in the midst of a heatwave. Or, thinking about it, just during normal summer day.\nIf he's being honest, Shouto's barely visited any beaches, and the few times he has it's always been late at night, the sun long gone and darkness spread out all around him. He\u2019s used to the cool sea breeze, the dark hues of the sea and the sand, and the coldness that radiates from them both. He\u2019s used to empty stretches of sand and water where there\u2019s nobody but him, nobody but his thoughts and the deepness that always seems to come with the night.\nHe\u2019s seen pictures of beaches in summer though, all bright colours and laughing faces, but he never quite expected it to be like this.\nIt\u2019s loud, both physically and metaphorically, and standing on the edge of it makes him want to turn around and go home. Midoriya smiles at him though, encouraging and excited, and Shouto takes a deep breath and takes a step onto the sand, into the mass of people and colour.\nThere are people running into the sea, the waves crashing gently against the bright yellow of the shore, and kids scream joyfully as the water his their legs. Towels and parasols are laid out on the sand, colourful and bright, and teenagers and families mill about in different groups. There\u2019s laughter and chattering, the distant sounds of songs pouring from a radio, and Shouto finds himself sticking close to Midoriya\u2019s back as the older boy navigates them through the crowds.\nFine grains of sand are seeping into his shoes as he walks and he feels a bit stupid for not following Midoriya\u2019s example and slipping his shoes off back on the promenade.\nUsually Shouto would've researched trivialities such as footwear and clothing, but he had made the mistake of falling asleep early and waking up late, leaving the dorms in a rush with only the essentials (keys, money, phone, and, his only beach essential, swimming trunks on underneath his shorts). His lack of research proved to be a vital mistake when Midoriya had asked where his beach bag was.\nApparently beach bags are so totally a thing, Shouto-kun, and are a must for day trips to the beach. So are sandals and towels and sunglasses.\u00a0\nSo, here he is at the beach, unprepared and feeling just a tad overwhelmed. The sun beats heavily above them and sweat is already making his top cling to him. The air around him smells of salt and sun cream, of sun and cider and Shouto's never experienced anything quite like this.\n\u201cDeku!\u201d Uraraka\u2019s voice calls. \u201cOver here!\u201d\nMidoriya shouts a greeting back, grabbing Shouto\u2019s hand in a seemingly automatic gesture as he breaks into a run. Shouto blinks, only having a few seconds to think what, to register the warmth of the other boys palm, the security of his grip, before his brain catches onto the fact that he needs to follow Midoriya before the other boy ends up dragging him across the sand.\nThe area his classmates have claimed is more secluded then the rest of the beach. It's further away from the main promenade and stalls which means less people have ventured this far out, which Shouto is silently thankful for.\nThe crowds are just- heavy. A bit too much in this heat.\nMidoriya let's go of Shouto's hand to pull Uraraka into a hug when they reach her, one which she readily returns and then, when he pulls away, she doesn't hesitate to pull Shouto into one of his own. \u201cShouto-kun!\u201d Uraraka says brightly, arms tight around his shoulders. She smells like the ocean and oranges and doesn't seem to mind that Shouto has no idea what to do with his hands, that he still has no idea how to handle human interaction properly.\u00a0\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know if you\u2019d come,\u201d Uraraka says in a quieter voice. She squeezes him once and he hesitantly pats her back in return. \u201cI\u2019m glad you did, though.\u201d She pulls back then, leaving Shouto feeling a weird mix of yearning and more settled then before.\n\u201cMidoriya asked.\u201d he explains when she smiles at him.\n\u201cFigures,\u201d Uraraka winks then, blue nail polish shimmering in the sun as she tucks a strand of hair behind her ear. She looks at him as if\u00a0 they're sharing some sort of secret and Shouto tilts his head, confused at what point she's trying to make.\nUraraka snorts at his obvious confusion and leans in close to whisper, \u201cMidoriya asked.\u201d And then, when his face remains blank, \u201che must be the only one who knows the secret language of Todoroki Shouto. I bet it barely took him five minutes to convince you.\u201d\nOh, Shouto\u00a0thinks, finally catching on to why she's implying. He then quickly ignores it, trying to physically will away the blush that threatens to bloom on his face, and pulls on his best innocent mask instead. He's not having this conversation here. Or ever, actually. Especially not with his classmates, with Midoriya\u2019s best friend at that, and especially not with Midoriya in earshot. \n\u201cJapanese,\u201d Shouto agrees, lowering his voice in turn. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough language to learn.\u201d\nShe scoffs a laugh, swatting at his arm with a knowing smile. \u201cMina's right, you are mean, Shouto-kun.\u201d\n\u201cOf course I\u2019m right,\u201d Ashido butts in, throwing an arm over Uraraka\u2019s shoulder. The action is easy, soft, and Shouto wonders just how long it\u2019ll take him to not be hyper aware of every bit of affection that happens around him. \u201cShouto\u2019s a meanie. You\u2019ve just gotta look past his pretty eyes to see it.\u201d\n\u201cHello Ashido.\u201d Shouto returns, feeling amusement bubble up in him at her words.\n\u201cHi hero,\u201d Ashido grins. \u201cSurprised you could come, considering all that secret summer training and all.\u201d She wiggles her eyebrows at him, damp hair curling at the ends.\n\u201cIzuku asked him,\u201d Uraraka stage whispers, giving Shouto a teasing smile.\n\u201cOh I see,\u201d Ashido says coyly. \u201cIs that all it takes?\u201d\n\u201cYou could\u2019ve asked me and I would\u2019ve said yes too, you realise.\u201d Shouto points out.\n\u201cYes, but that\u2019s not the same, is it?\u201d Ashido coo\u2019s, reaching out to pinch his cheek. Shouto lets her, fighting the urge not to lean into her touch.\n\u201cYou realise he\u2019s not actually a fucking cat, right?\u201d Bakugou says from the ground. He\u2019s sprawled out on a towel squinting up at them with Kirishima at his side. The red headed boys eyes light up at Bakugou's words, Ashido letting out a snicker as Uraraka says, \u201che's a kitten, Bakugou, not a cat.\u201d which means that--\n\u201cYou didn't.\u201d Shouto narrows his eyes at Midoriya who gives him an innocent look.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t what?\u201d Yaoyorozu asks from behind them, Jirou at her side and a bag of cold sodas in her hand.\nShouto looks back at where Midoriya\u2019s expression is breaking into a more guilty one, green eyes amused. \u201cWhat?\u201d He says lightly, a grin stretching across his face. \u201cYou said not to make it my profile picture, not that I couldn\u2019t send it around.\u201d\n\u201cMidoriya,\u201d Shouto starts, feeling a bit betrayed. He also feels embarrassed and - pleased, maybe, that Midoriya would like a photo of him enough to send it to other people.\n\u201cOh, is this that cat picture Midoriya made?\u201d Jirou asks. \u201cIt was cute.\u201d she shrugs. And then, a bit more defensively at Sato's snort, \u201cWhat? It was.\u201d\nBakugou makes an amused sound when all of the girls nod their heads in agreement, which - well. Shouto isn\u2019t sure how to feel about it. Embarrassed, definitely. Happy, maybe.\u00a0\nFor some reason even Midoriya is blushing slightly, ears more red than normal. Shouto wonders why, takes a brief moment to note the knowing look Iida is giving the smaller boy, but then shrugs it all off. It's a heatwave after all, and there\u2019s no reason for Midoriya to be blushing over a picture he made as a joke.\nSo, the beach is hot and loud but also fun.\nSettled further away from the main crowds means that they\u2019ve got a direct route from where all their towels and bags are sprawled to the sea. The water isn\u2019t as cold during the day as it is a night but it still has a bite to it, familiar and making him shiver, but it\u2019s a cool relief to the oppressive heat of the sun. The air seems thinner down by the water too, less humid and more breathable.\nShouto lets himself get pulled into the sea and into a game of keep the ball out of the water which he eventually gets disqualified from.\n\u201cShouto-kun,\u201d Iida scolds for the umpteenth time. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep doing that.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s allowed to do it!\u201d Asui defends from beside him, Sero shouting in agreement.\n\u201cYou\u2019re only saying that because he\u2019s on your team.\u201d Shoji mutters, arms crossed and eyes amused.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no rule book for this game.\u201d Kaminari defends from his right. They\u2019re all waist deep in the water, the ball floating between them on a quickly melting patch of ice.\n\u201cYou\u2019re only saying that because you\u2019re cheating as well.\u201d Sato returns quickly.\n\u201cMe?\u201d Kaminari squawks, water flying as he flails his hands in apparent shock. \u201cI\u2019m not cheating!\u201d\n\u201cYour team is.\u201d Sato insists. \u201cHagakure can\u2019t keep making the ball float above the water until one of you grabs it, it's unfair on the rest of us.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a splash then, Hagakure\u2019s voice ringing out as she cries, \u201cI told you they\u2019d notice!\u201d\n\u201cWell, Shouto\u2019s using his ice to keep the ball above water!\u201d Kaminari argues, pointing an accusing finger in his direction. Shouto watches in amusement as Iida groans, eyes looking skyward for patience as Bakugou steps in.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the fucking point we\u2019re trying to make! Both of your teams are cheating and it\u2019s fucking unfair. I say we rule you out.\u201d\n\u201cWhat!\u201d Kaminari splutters. \u201cWait- no! Come on, don\u2019t kick us from the game!\u201d\n\u201cThen fucking play properly, you fucking idiots.\u201d\n\u201cAre we really gonna fall out over a game?\u201d Midoriya asks aloud to which Bakugou angrily shouts \u201cyes.\u201d at the same time Asui says \u201cno!\u201d\n\u201cThis is ridiculous.\u201d Iida sighs, making his way over to the ball and grabbing it from the remains of his iceberg. \u201cHow about, from now on, no cheating?\u201d\n\u201cI think they should be disqualified.\u201d Bakugou snaps, ever the one to get competitive.\nShouto also likes to get competitive, but he feels more relaxed today, pleased to be spending his summer away from his father and buzzing from how much of a good holiday he\u2019s been having.\nThe heat of the sun is making him feel a bit giddy too, more daring, and when he does eventually get disqualified it\u2019s for freezing the ball to Bakugou\u2019s hand and asking \u201cOh wow. Now who\u2019s cheating, huh?\u201d over the top of Bakugou's cursing. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep a hold of the ball, Bakugou.\u201d\nMidoriya\u2019s answering laugh is also a bonus, as is the vein that pops in Iida's forehead. \u201cRight, well.\u201d Iida calls over the top of everyone, trying to take control back over the game. \u201cShouto-kun, you were warned. I'm afraid you're disqualified.\u201d\nShouto doesn't particularly care, not when Midoriya offers him a grin that could rival the sun. He chooses to swim for a bit after that, Yaoyorozu deciding to join him.\nThey try out all different strokes, seeing who can swim the fastest and who can hold their breath for longest. Yaoyorozu also spends ten minutes trying to convince him to do an underwater handstand in show of true talent but she\u2019s dragged into a chicken fight before she can make him do it.\nAshido hoists her onto her shoulders and Kirishima gives Shouto a pleading look which,\u00a0\"no, Kirishima. I\u2019m not getting on your shoulders. Now or ever.\"\u00a0\nKirishima looks like he's more than willing to jump up onto Shouto's shoulders, so Shouto makes a hasty retreat back to the shore, choosing to sunbathe instead.\nSunbathing is a novelty he hasn't been allowed to indulge in before, but after ten minutes he can understand the appeal of it. The towel he lying on is Midoriya\u2019s (because Shouto didn\u2019t think to bring one of his own) and it\u2019s soft and smells of Midoriya\u2019s laundry detergent, something that makes him feel - happy. Warm.\nHe can feel the sun soaking into his skin and it's such a soothing experience that, before he knows it, he finds himself falling into a half doze.\n\u201cDid you fucking not put any sun cream on?\u201d Bakugou\u2019s voice asks him after a while. Shouto\u2019s not too sure how long it\u2019s been, but the other boy had been the only one to join Shouto back with their bags, Bakugou choosing to sprawl in the small amount of shade their parasol gives out.\nShouto blinks his eyes open, lids feeling heavy and body warm. \u201cDid you?\u201d He asks, not wanting to admit that he doesn\u2019t own any sun cream and hadn\u2019t thought to buy any.\n\u201cOf course I did, you fucking idiot.\u201d Bakugou\u2019s frowning at him, eyes more concerned then they usually are when they're directed his way. \u201cDoes the sun melt half of your fucking brain when it comes out, Icy Hot?\u201d\n\u201cApparently.\u201d Shouto mutters, pushing himself up. His skin prickles slightly, everything seeming to bright around him. He goes to use his cold side to cool himself off, to clear his head, but it falls through his grasp, stuttering and then lying dormant.\n\u201cIf you've given yourself heat stroke I\u2019m leaving you here to die alone.\u201d Bakugou warns him as he starts to dig through his own bag. \u201cI mean it, Halfie. I\u2019m not fucking saving you from your own stupidity.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re stupid.\u201d Shouto returns, thoughts feeling syrupy and slow.\n\u201cNice comeback.\u201d Bakugou snorts before making a triumphant noise, saying \u201chere.\u201d as he throws something at Shouto. A bottle of sun cream lands besides him with a thud and he blinks at it in surprise, turning his gaze back to where Bakugou is still glaring at him.\n\u201cYou\u2019re letting me use your sun cream?\u201d Shouto says a bit dumbly. His heads starting to hurt, a dull thud building behind his temples, and he wishes he could clear his head.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Bakugou says sarcastically. \u201cI\u2019m letting you use my tanning oil.\u201d\n\u201cWhat.\u201d Shouto blinks down at the sun cream, wondering if he\u2019s missed something. He pokes at the bottle, wondering if the illusion of it will shatter, but it stubbornly remains a bottle of cream.\n\u201cJesus,\u201d Bakugou snaps. \u201cDid you really melt your fucking brain? It\u2019s sun cream, idiot. Use it.\u201d\nShouto feels his cheek flush and- well, actually, his cheeks were already flushed, whole body flushed, really. His skin is uncomfortably hot and it feels too tight when he moves, too thin and prickly. His hands, he realises, shake when they go to pick up the bottle of sun cream.\nHe doesn\u2019t draw attention to it though and Bakugou doesn\u2019t say anything, which it probably for the best. The sound of the sea washes over him as Shouto tries to smear what appears to be too much cream onto one arm with trembling fingers, ears starting to ring.\nHis brain feels foggy and slow and he doesn\u2019t even notice that Bakugou\u2019s moved until cool fingers grab onto his wrist and halt his sloppy movement. \u201cIdiot.\u201d Bakugou repeats. \u201cYou\u2019re fucking boiling.\u201d\n\u201cHalf hot,\u201d Shouto points out, feeling frustrated at his own stupidity. \u201cOf course I\u2019m boiling.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, half hot my arse,\u201d Bakugou snorts. \u201cCome on,\u201d He tugs at Shouto\u2019s wrist then, keeps tugging until Shouto is standing on shaky legs. \u201cTo the shade we go, Halfie.\u201d Shouto's legs aren't working properly and Bakugou ends up having to half drag him to the shade of the parasol, forcing him down on the cool sand and -\n\u201cHonestly,\u201d Bakugou grumbles, forcing a bottle of water into Shouto\u2019s empty hand and scooping the sun cream out of the other one. \u201cFor one of the smartest people in our class, you sure are a fucking idiot, Icy Hot.\u201d He crouches in front of Shouto then, face still set in a scowl but a knowing look to his eyes. A familiar look.\nThey\u2019ve dealt with each other before is the thing, the remedial lessons they had to take together forcing them both to adapt and settle within each others company, to learn from each other. They\u2019ve both seen each other fail and push themselves too hard, have both sat next to each other on the way back from the classes with bruises on their skin and a mutual feeling of accomplishment in their chests.\n\u201cDrink that,\u201d Bakugou points to the water. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll fucking make sure the rest of your precious skin stays protected. God forbid Deku blames me for your lack of self-reservation.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean, Shouto wants to ask, but his thoughts are jumbled, tongue too heavy. He takes a sip of the water - the cool water - and it's a relief when it hits his dry throat. He's thirsty, he realises, and the way the water flows down to his stomach is wonderful.\nShouto suddenly can\u2019t stop drinking, greedily downing the bottle of water, plastic crunching under his fingers as his cold side vibrates back to life.\u00a0\nCoolness is slowly starting to spread over his entire body as his right side reboots itself. His skin starts to feel more settled and less like any movement will make it tear apart.\nBakugou\u2019s also rubbing the sun cream over him, currently working on his shoulders, which also might be helping. The lotion is cool as the other boy smears it down his arms, on his neck. It leaves his skin feeling pleasant, leaves him feeling grateful and relaxed, up until he notes why Bakugou is frowning with concentration at his face.\nThe other boys fingers tap his nose, draw three lines on one cheek, and then the other, and --\n\u201cJust like Deku imagined.\u201d Uraraka coos as she drops down besides them. \u201cYou make such a cute cat, Shouto.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Shouto protests quickly, hands reaching up to smear the cream in. \u201cBakugou,\u201d he scolds, trying to think of something else to say to the other boy but coming up with nothing. \u201cBakugou.\u201d he repeats, voice more annoyed than last time. There's also definitely way too much affection behind his words and Shouto can feel his face get uncomfortably hot again.\n\u201cThat sun's gone straight to your head.\u201d Bakugou snorts, obviously noting the friendliness to Shouto\u2019s voice.\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one who just put sun cream on me,\u201d Shouto points out half heartedly. \u201cMaybe you're the one with heat stroke.\u201d Bakugou doesn\u2019t look embarrassed though, just offers Shouto what could be a real smile before it quickly turns back into a scowl.\n\u201cI only had to do that because you\u2019re a fucking idiot, Halfie.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not an idiot.\u201d Uraraka defends, curling an arm around his shoulders and tugging him into her side. His brain still feels a bit slow, a bit clouded, and he finds himself sagging against her before he can think twice about it, seeking out comfort he didn't know he needed.\nBakugou scoffs, sharing a look with Shouto, one in which the both of them acknowledge that yeah, Shouto is a bit of an idiot. \u201cThanks,\u201d he tells the older boy. \u201cFor the water.\u201d\nFor helping me just then, he doesn\u2019t say.\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Bakugou returns, and then. \u201cNow stop hogging all of the shade.\u201d\nShouto blinks, noting that he and Uraraka are sitting in the middle of the shade spot the parasol gives them. He goes to move but Uraraka tightens her hold, stopping him from getting up. \u201cYou\u2019ve hogged it for ages, Bakugou.\u201d she tuts. \u201cLearn to share.\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d Bakugou snaps, glowering at them both. He doesn\u2019t argue though, doesn\u2019t force them to move, which is an improvement to how he was a year ago. \u201cWe can all fucking share the shade. Happy?\u201d\n\u201cYes, actually.\u201d Uraraka sniffs. Her eyes are glittering happily when Shouto turns to glance at her, face more tanned then he's used to and cheeks rosy from the sun. \u201cWanna watch some videos with me on YouTube?\u201d she asks him, wagging her phone in the air.\nShouto considers it. He could leave and go back to his towel in the sun. He could even take his stuff and head back to Yuuei, or venture back into the sea, leaving Uraraka to her videos and Bakugou to his shade.\nOr, he could stay here, Uraraka\u2019s arm warm around his shoulders, and watch videos with her whilst his body slowly cools back down.\n\u201cThat\u2019d be nice.\u201d he says quietly. She smiles, sweet and soft, before, in an action similar to Midoriya, starting to ramble about what video she\u2019s going to show him.\nBakugou grumbles beside them, makes a show of snatching his towel and laying it out again. When he lays down though, the top half of his body in the shade, his head presses against Shouto\u2019s knee, a firm pressure that the older boy doesn't move away from.\nIt\u2019s a simple gesture, an easy one. A simple, easy affection that means probably way more to Shouto then it should. It leaves him feeling wanted and soft and happy.\niv.\n\u201cShouto,\u201d Midoriya breathes. Shouto can just make out the other boy from his position, big green eyes clouded with pain, with panic. Midoriya\u2019s hands shake as they reach out towards Shouto.\nShouto wants to grab on, wants to hold them and pull Midoriya closer, wants to help, but he can\u2019t. He can\u2019t. \u201cShouto, please.\u201d\nShouto feels frozen in place and, almost absently, he thinks that maybe he is, that maybe something's stuck him to the spot, but the image of Midoriya bloodied and hurt and choking on his own blood, on his own frothing mouth, is too much. It wipes away all other thoughts, takes over all of his emotions. He wants to move, he does, but the image in front of him is consuming him, is latching onto his very being and keeping him there.\n\u201cHelp me.\u201d Midoriya spits, pleads, voice growing weaker, and Shouto thinks okay. Thinks, okay I can help - I can do something, but it\u2019s too late.\nIt's too late.\nMidoriya spasms, body twisting and back arching him off the floor as he convulses, eyes rolling back into his head. It seems to go on for minutes, time dragging on twitch by twitch, and in the back of Shouto\u2019s mind he knows that seizures that last longer than five minutes are dangerous. He knows that the older boy needs help, needed help before this happened, but it\u2019s too late. Shouto watches with wide eyes and detached horror as the older boy twitches once, twice, before falling flat on the floor and stilling.\nAnd then, with something raw building inside him, with something thick and clogging and dark, nasty, he tries with everything he has to move. He wants to be next to Midoriya, needs to be, even, and everything in him is fighting and trying because he needs to see if-\nHis breath shudders out of him, skin and bones suddenly feeling too tight and too thin. Everything feels so wrong and he knows that he\u2019s panicking, knows that him panicking won\u2019t help anyone, that it has never helped anyone, but-\nShouto needs to feel that the other boy has a pulse. He needs to feel that Midoriya is still breathing.\nSo Shouto tries, and he tries and he tries and he tries.\nHe can feel his forehead break in a sweat, can feel his laboured breaths, the tightness in his chest, almost as if his ribs are digging into his lungs as he tries to move, but he can't. He tries twitching a finger, tries to blink, tries to move his mouth and talk, shout for help, but he can\u2019t do anything.\nSlow down, he tells himself. Calm down. You don't know if he's- \nShouto can't finish that thought. Won't finish it.\nHe can't move (hecan\u2019tmovehecan\u2019t)-\nSo, he takes a breath, tries to clear his mind, tries\u00a0to remember what he\u2019s been taught his entire life. He tells himself that everything is fine and then tries even harder to believe the words.\nHe can't move and that\u2019s fine because he\u2019s felt like this before, has been beaten down and trained enough to know that he doesn\u2019t need to move to activate his quirk.\nHe can\u2019t shut his eyes, can't even blink, and with a detached sort of acknowledgement he knows that it\u2019s a warning sign, that it means something, but Midoriya isn\u2019t breathing, isn\u2019t moving, limbs twisted, and body crumpled, and Shouto needs to do something. Now.\nSomeone's hurt his friend and-\nThen he sees Midoriya\u2019s eyes turn glassy, turn empty, chest lying still, and Shouto lets the feeling inside of him build, lets the horror and the anger circle and pierce. It\u2019s thick and clogging and he can\u2019t breathe with it and if he wasn\u2019t immobile before then he thinks he definitely would be now. It crushes his insides and fills his pores, his very being, and then, with an internal shout, he lets it loose.\nIce explodes around him, sharp and biting and cold, colder than anything he\u2019s made before. He doesn't care what damage it does, who it hurts, because Midoriya is dead.\nHe hears things around him break, hears the splintering of wood and the cracking of brick, of plaster, but the image of Midoriya doesn\u2019t fade, doesn\u2019t move, even as ice surrounds it. Midoriya lies dead (please no, no) and Shouto couldn't protect him, couldn't help him, couldn't even offer him comfort. He could only watch it happen.\nThe overwhelming grief, the hurt, is something so unfamiliar and ugly that he wishes for a second that he'd never met the other boy. Shouto doesn't let himself get close to people for a good reason. He's been taught that caring about people will only hurt him in the end, has been shown by his mother, been told by his father, been aware of it from the distance between him and his siblings, and yet, he still somehow made the stupid mistake of caring for his classmates. Of caring for Midoriya.\nHe knew that it could hurt, that choosing to care will always hurt him in the end, but he never pictured it feeling like this. Midoriya doesn't even twitch as his ice surrounds the room, lays still and -\nHe lays still.\nIt\u2019s that tiny detail which makes him pause, the small fact bursting the bubble he's in and slowing the cloying buzzing of his powers underneath his skin. There are shouts in the distance and his cold side is numb, fingertips turning blue and nails dark.\nShouto knows how to protect himself, how to disable others if it comes down to it. Shouto knows his ice better than he knows himself. He knows how it looks, how it should work.\nMidoriya\u2019s body should be pale, should have the hints of frostbite clawing at where his face touches the floor, but it stays the same healthy colour he\u2019s used to. He\u2019s all freckles and tan skin, dark hair shifting slightly from the onslaught of movement around them instead of being frozen together. It\u2019s that what makes him blink, what allows him to think through the haze, and whatever had a hold on him let's go.\nShouto staggers, eyes watering and throat dry, and then he falls to his knees, tingling hands pressing against the frosted floor. When he looks around the room the image of Midoriya is gone.\nInstead of the lifeless body, he\u00a0sees the destruction around him, ice and ruined walls, ruined ceilings, and he sucks in a ragged breath. His teeth are chattering together so hard it hurts and he knows he should use his fire to warm himself up, but something is still screaming wrong.\nHis mind feels thick and heavy and he squints, trying to take in his surroundings. There aren\u2019t any windows, though, and his ice has destroyed the only light that was in the room, leaving everything cloaked in an eerie darkness. His breath puffs out in front of him, barely visible, and he notes that he\u2019s breathing too quickly, too fast and too panicked.\nHe knows he needs to calm down, that panicking will do him no good, so he tries to reign himself in the only way he knows how: by pushing all the panic and the emotions deep down inside of himself.\nHe forces everything back, tucks it all away, and forces himself to breathe.\nHe\u2019s been trained for this, to some extent. He should know what to do.\nHe takes another breath and ignores the anxiety that bites at his skin as he tries to recall his training.\u00a0\n(He tries to ignore the overflowing mess of emotions that's struggling to escape from the back of his mind.)\nFirst, take account of any injuries.\nThere\u2019s a numbness to his arm, but that can be ignored for now, the use of his ice always leaving his skin raw and sensitive. His legs are fine, ribs are fine, head-\nHis head hurts. Shouto reaches up to press against the pain in his temple and the entire right side of his head throbs in return. When he pulls away his fingers are bloody and trembling. Shouto blinks, glancing around the room and noting that it\u2019s hard to focus on anything easily. A concussion, then. Great.\nNext, where the hell is he?\nThe room is unfamiliar, empty and holding no defining features. It smells of fresh paint and water which. Well, none of those things really help him identify where he is. Shouto also has no recollection of how he got here. He tries to think back but his mind feels sluggish and clogged, as if all the fine grains of his memory have been washed over by an angry tide.\nThere\u2019s something though, something bright and lurking in the dark expanse of his head. He focuses on it, breathing in deeply, and recalls the fact that his class were at the new training facility in town. Aizawa had gotten them access and they were getting tutored by a professional. They\u2019d been in the lesson for about\u00a0fifteen\u00a0minutes before the ceiling had opened up and Nomu\u2019s had poured in, loud and destructive and looming tall above them all.\nShouto can\u2019t really remember much after that, the memory becoming blurred and rippled, but it doesn\u2019t take much to put two and two together and realise that he\u2019s either been kidnapped or separated from everyone else.\nHe blinks his eyes open and remembers Midoriya\u2019s body, remembers the sounds of him choking and gurgling. He remembers how quiet it was after Midoriya had stilled.\nTaken, probably. Cornered. Alone.\nShouto can feel his nails biting into his palms as he focuses on the empty spot where Midoriya was, where blood and a broken body should be, and knows that he wouldn\u2019t have stood by like that if the other boy was hurt.\nHe remembers the pain in his chest, the hollow feeling in his heart, and knows with utter certainty that he would\u2019ve never let Midoriya get into that state in the first place. Not while Shouto himself was still alive. Shouto would\u2019ve protected him or, worse coming to it, jumped in front of any harm coming to Midoriya. Shouto wouldn\u2019t have let the other boy get that hurt, and if it did, if someone or something had hurt Midoriya to that extent, Shouto definitely wouldn\u2019t have just stood there, which means-\nLaughter to his right interrupts his thoughts and he snaps his attention to it, eyes narrowing and hackles rising. On the floor, surrounded by ice, bitter and biting at pale skin, is a man. He doesn\u2019t have a face, Shouto realises, which is - no, the man does have a face, but it looks like a blank canvas, eyes, nose, and mouth covered by thick skin. It makes Shouto want to real back, stomach twisting at the sight, but he knows better than to show fear in face of anyone else.\n\u201cStupid boy,\u201d a deep voice says. It\u2019s the man, he realises, who has the deep gravelly voice. \u201cOr maybe,\u201d the man continues, making Shouto give a quick glance around the room to confirm it's only them in here. \"You\u2019re a clever boy, hm?\u201d\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d Shouto demands flatly, trying to force his calm facade to the front as he pushes himself into a standing position.\n\u201cAh, no no. This isn\u2019t about me, sweet. This is about you,\u201d The man coos softly. His fingers twitch in the ice, almost as if they want to reach out towards him, and Shouto automatically strengthens it, securing the other man to the floor even further. \u201cI know all about you of course, Todoroki Shouto.\u201d The man goes on, seemingly not alarmed at the coating of ice pinning him down.\n\u201cYou're part of the League of Villains?\u201d Shouto guesses aloud, and then, firmer, \"You work with them.\"\nHe wishes his mind was as clear as it normally was. He\u2019s not normally this slow, this stupid, but his head hurts and the image of Midoriya dead on the floor lurks behind every blink.\n\u201cMore like work with.\u201d The voice tells him. \u201cWe can think of me like an intern, if you\u2019d like.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to think anything about you.\u201d Shouto says flatly. He observes the man one more time, double checking that there\u2019s no escape, before he starts to look around the room for an easy exit. He can\u2019t fight this man by himself in this state and he needs to get help, get someone with more authority, and, maybe a bit selfishly, wants to put as much distance between himself and the man that showed him what Midoriya\u2019s eyes would look like lifeless.\n\u201cI like to think about you,\u201d The voice tells him. \u201cI\u2019ve been so excited to meet you, sweet thing.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a door to his left. Possibly locked. He can either make a run for it and find help, or wait until someone finds him. Running in the long run would be safer for him, is what he wants to do, but then he remembers that he\u2019s training to be a hero.\nHeroes don\u2019t leave villains unattended, especially ones that works for the League at that. He\u2019s in no state to fight, to help others, but leaving is probably one of the worst things he can do right now. He can\u2019t let this man escape and if he leaves the room there's a high chance of that happening.\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard so much about you, you know?\u201d The man continues.\n\u201cHave you really,\u201d Shouto says flatly, nausea still curling at his stomach. \u201cThat must\u2019ve been nice for you.\u201d\n\u201cVery nice.\u201d The man breathes. \u201cThe things you\u2019ve seen. The things you\u2019ve gone through.\u201d\nThat draws Shouto\u2019s attention a bit more, eyebrows furrowing as he turns his gaze back onto the man. \u201cYou know nothing of what I\u2019ve been through.\u201d\n\u201cOh darling,\u201d The man laughs, the English words twisting and sounding wrong. Even though the man doesn\u2019t have eyes, Shouto can tell that he's looking at him, can feel the man stare inside of his soul. \"Sweet little Shouto.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t call me that.\u201d Shouto snaps, fingers twitching by his side. Nobody\u2019s called him that name for years. He hasn\u2019t let anyone call him that since-\n\u201cBut your mother loved to call you that,\u201d The man says lightly. \u201cShe loved her sweet, little, child.\u201d\n\u201cStop.\u201d Shouto warns, eyes wide and fixed on where the man is frozen to the floor. His mind is reeling, thoughts flashing by quickly as he tries to piece together just how this man knows what his mother used to call him as a child.\n\u201cYou were mommy\u2019s and daddy\u2019s favourite, weren\u2019t you?\u201d Shouto feels his knees start to shake at the words. \u201cStealing all that attention away from your poor, poor siblings.\u201d\n\u201cStop it.\u201d Shouto says, voice weaker than before. He tries to blink but discovers he can\u2019t, eyes stuck on the villain on the floor.\n\u201cBeing their favourite got you nowhere in the end though, did it.\u201d The man laughs then, something cruel and dirty that makes Shouto feel cold. That makes him feel disgusting. \u201cIt only got you hurt. Maybe their love is nothing but a curse, hm?\u201d\n\u201cMy little Shouto,\u201d His mother's voice echoes in his head. It sounds different to the voice he\u2019s grown used to at the hospital, more put together and sweet, like how he remembers her sounding when he was younger. \u201cWhat did he do to you?\u201d\nHe looks at the villain and thinks, I don\u2019t know, but then Endeavour steps out of the shadows and he realises that his mother wasn\u2019t really directing the words at him at all.\n\u201cMe?\u201d Endeavor asks darkly, lighting up the room with his fire. Shouto absently thinks that he should be searching for a sign of - of something, of anything, but he can\u2019t.  He can\u2019t look away from his fathers looming form. \u201cMore like what did you do, Rei.\u201d\n\u201cNothing in comparison to you,\u201d His mother answers from - oh god. His chest constricts, skin itching and feeling wrong as he registers the fact that her voice isn\u2019t coming from inside of his mind, but from behind him.  \u201cYou\u2019ve ruined him.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve improved him.\u201d Endeavor snaps, stepping closer. Shouto can see the ice he\u2019s formed start to sizzle and melt. \u201cWhich wasn\u2019t easy, considering all you did.\u201d\n\u201cI loved him when you didn\u2019t.\u201d His mother bites back, voice harder than Shouto\u2019s ever heard it before. \u201cI showed him kindness when you pushed him too far.\u201d\n\u201cYou poured boiling water all over his face,\u201d Endeavour snarls. Shouto can feel the heat of his father\u2019s flames as he steps closer, can feel his skin starting to blister when he takes another step. Shouto wants to cry out, wants to say something, but he can\u2019t move, can\u2019t speak.\nIt\u2019s like he isn\u2019t even here, in a way.\nEverything around him dulls and blurs until all he can focus on is his father in front of him, his mother behind him. The words spilling from their mouths.\n\u201cI was trying to fix him.\u201d His mother says, voice holding no trace of doubt, and something inside of Shouto snaps.\n\nNo, no, no, no, no.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t broken, you stupid woman. Not until that.\u201d\n\u201cHe was,\u201d no, no. \u201cHe was becoming too much like you. He had your Quirk, your personality, your face. The entire left side of him made me sick. And then his power,\u201d he hears the shudder in his mother's voice, the disgust almost palpable in the air. \u201cIt was a curse.\u201d\n\u201cThat power was what made him brilliant.\" His father argues, eyes flicking over Shouto as if he's something precious before focusing on something over his shoulder. \"He needed to defeat All Might for us, after all. He needed to be me and then more.\u201d\n\u201cHe needed help,\u201d He can feel his mother's breath on his right ear, her body radiating a chilly warmth that Shouto had almost forgotten about. She smells the same too, fresh and floral, but there\u2019s something else lurking there too, something wrong. Something murky and rotting. \u201cFire and fire, heat and heat. I thought I could burn all the badness out of him.\u201d\nMom, Shouto\u2019s absently aware of the tears that well in his eyes and fall down his face, but he still can\u2019t move, can\u2019t blink. He wants to shut his eyes from the image in front of him, wants to press his hands over his ears like he did as a child, wants to ignore his parents and their horrible, horrible truths.\nHis father\u2019s face is angry and familiar, the shadows from his flames making it seem more menacing then it usually does. It makes him look like the monster of a man that haunts Shouto\u2019s dreams. It makes him feel sick.\nThe panic that had welled up inside of him gnaws at his ribs and claws it way up further, settling in his throat and choking him, but he still can\u2019t move.\n\u201cHe was made perfectly,\u201d His father shouts, heat burning and painful, spit landing on Shouto's skin and sizzling like lava. \u201cHe had all the potential to be the best hero this world had ever seen, but you coddled him. You ruined him, both physically and mentally.\u201d\n\u201cI tried my best,\u201d His mother whispers. Shouto feels cold fingers on his cheek, trailing through the tears. Wiping them away. \u201cI did my best, didn\u2019t I?\u201d Long hair brushes his neck, lips brushing the shell of his ear as his mother whispers, \u201cmy sweet Shouto.\u201d\nHe wants to scream, wants to move, wants to let everything in him out. Wants to stop choking on nothing and wants to stop burning on fire and ice and-\nHis mind is sluggish, body already weak from overusing his Quirk earlier when Midoriya had stilled.\n\u201cShouto?\u201d A distant voice calls. His father\u2019s face looms in front of him, angry and searing, and the\u00a0thin fingers on his face trail up to his eye, ghosting over his scar, the ugly marring of his face, and it makes his stomach clench. He's never let anyone touch him there, doesn\u2019t like that anybody even has to look at the scar, let alone touch it.\n\u201cThis helped fix you, right baby?\u201d His mother asks, pushing in, pushing down. It hurts, throbs and burns, and he wants to scream, wants to struggle and beg her to stop, beg his father to stop, but he can\u2019t. He can't do anything as his mother claws at the scar, at his eye, at his face.\nAnd then, he can.\nEverything sizzles out and he falls to the floor again, knees giving out and body curling in on itself as the world rushes back in.\nThe shouting inside of him turns into an outward keen, something pained and feral and raw. To hear his mother say that, to hear the words that haunt his dreams come from her lips, the words that lurk in the darkness of his mind, hurts. It hurts and there\u2019s a new emptiness to his chest that makes it ache, that causes his limbs to tremble and his breaths to escape him in a too fast tandem, uncontrollable and erratic.\nThere\u2019s the sound of movement around him but he doesn\u2019t want to see it, doesn\u2019t want to be reminded of his fathers or anger or to finally see his mothers face after what she said, after what she did.\n\u201cShouto?\u201d someone asks, familiar and not so familiar at all. A hand touches his shoulder and he tenses up, flinches away, curls into himself further. He doesn\u2019t want to be touched, doesn\u2019t want to see who\u2019s in front of him. \u201cHey,\u201d the same person says. \u201cCome on, none of that, Shouto. I need you to look at me.\u201d\nShouto can\u2019t look, though. He doesn\u2019t want to look.\nThe overwhelming knowledge that he\u2019s wrong, that he\u2019s broken and disgusting, takes him back to before Yuuei. Back to when his mother had gotten hurt because of him and then had turned to hurt him instead. Back to the space of after, where there had only been his father and his twisted love.\nHe always knew that something in him was wrong, was broken, but to hear it, to have it whispered in his ear-\nHe wants to be left alone. He wants everybody to go, wants to be let go. He wants to rot and dissolve into nothing.\n\u201cKid,\u201d A hand hovers over his head, radiating warmth, and slowly lowers, making Shouto tense. The fingers are gentle, though, as they smooth his hair, brushing it down before curling towards his jaw.\nWhen the hand tilts his head up Shouto lets it, follows the movement and rises slightly, is steadied by another hand on his arm. When he looks, he expects to see his father (who has never been this gentle with him) or worse, his mother (who hasn\u2019t had a chance to be this gentle with him in years), and something in him trembles and hurts and yearns.\nHe doesn\u2019t know who he wants it to be (nobody, maybe), but he expects to see someone he doesn't want to, to see the people who were meant to look after him but didn't.\nInstead of his parents, though, he sees Aizawa kneeling in front of him, eyes bloodshot and kind and concerned, everything his parents hadn\u2019t been. \u201cShouto.\u201d his teacher says, fingers warm and gentle on his jaw.\n\u201cSensei,\u201d Shouto breathes. Tears are still leaking down his cheeks and they come faster when he registers the face in front of him. Shouto can\u2019t even be embarrassed, not when the feeling of relief is suddenly so apparent. Aizawa is safe, is always so safe when the rest of his life isn\u2019t.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Aizawa tells him. There\u2019s movement around them but Shouto doesn\u2019t look, eyes stuck on Aizawa, on his concern, his dark clothes, on the way his hair shifts as he ducks his head lower to meet Shouto\u2019s eyes.\nHe isn\u2019t sure if what he\u2019s seeing is real, but he can blink when he tries, can twitch his fingers and curl them into Aizawa\u2019s sleeves. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d\nShouto\u2019s head hurts and he feels sick, feels like there\u2019s a gaping hole inside of his chest, but Aizawa is here and his father is gone, his mother is gone, and -\n\u201cMidoriya?\u201d He begs, voice cracking. The image of the other boy laying on the floor, blood and froth around his mouth, hands still outstretched towards Shouto as he stopped convulsing, plays in his mind. It plays in his thoughts, makes him feel wrong and ruined.\n\u201cHe\u2019s fine.\u201d Aizawa\u2019s fingers go from his jaw to his temple, frowning at where Shouto knows blood is. \u201cHe\u2019s outside with everyone else. Do you remember where we are?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s fine?\u201d Shouto presses, remembering lifeless eyes and the pain inside of him. Aizawa nods and Shouto sags forward with a small noise, forehead bumping into Aizawa\u2019s shoulder.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Aizawa says in warning. Shouto knows he wants his questions answered, that he wants to know what happened, that his teacher needs to know whether Shouto\u2019s okay, but-\nWell. Shouto doesn\u2019t feel okay, is the thing. He hurts, inside and out, feels thawed and raw and empty. He wants to stop, wants everything to slow down and pause for a second so that he can catch back up.\nHe hasn\u2019t stopped crying, hasn\u2019t stopped feeling the weird mix of numb and burning ever since his father stepped too close, since he thought that Midoriya had died. A sob escapes him, the sound muffled in Aizawa\u2019s top, and he feels his teacher pause.\n\u201cYou\u2019re okay.\u201d Aizawa\u2019s hand threads back through Shouto\u2019s hair then, the other hand on his arm curling around his shoulders when Shouto falls further forward. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, kid. Come on, you\u2019re okay.\u201d\nAizawa lets him sag further into him, body firm and stable under him. Real. Alive.\nShouto can\u2019t stop shaking, can\u2019t stop the small keening sobs that pour from him. Everything hurts, and he feels stupid and useless and he wishes that he could forget it all. He doesn\u2019t want the memory of Midoriya slumped on the floor, doesn\u2019t want to know the sound of his mother's voice as she justifies her actions.\nAizawa shushes him when his crying turns harsher, breath stuttering and body shaking. He shifts them so that he\u2019s sitting with Shouto clinging to him, which should be embarrassing, but instead is just oddly soothing.\nHe lets Shouto cry, lets him shake apart and hurt, and holds on with gentle arms and a firm voice. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Aizawa repeats, fingers combing through his matted hair. \u201cI\u2019ve got you, kid.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey\u2019re still at the training centre in town, as it turns out. Shouto had been in the storage room adjacent to the boiler room at the back of the building. His ice, they tell him, is the only reason they knew how to find him.\nWhen he walks outside, blindly following Aizawa, he sees that the building is cracked and splintered. The crack starts from the floor where Shouto assumes the storage room was, and runs up to the top of the building, ugly and destructive. Bricks scatter the ground, dust hanging in the air as people rush about. He see\u2019s water running down the side of the building and a tendrilling mass of ice escaping from inside of the gaping wound.\nShouto knows he should probably feel something when looking at it. Guilt, maybe. Shame. He doesn\u2019t feel anything though, mind numb and empty.\nThe building is surrounded by heroes and police, sirens ringing in the distance, the attack apparently being way worse than Shouto can remember, which isn\u2019t saying much, all things considered.\nHe\u2019s led to an ambulance where a medic checks him over and tells him that that his worst injury is a mild concussion.\nShouto blinks at the woman and wonders if he should tell her that his insides feel torn and shredded, that his mind feels jumbled and his skin too tight, but the woman is talking to Aizawa now instead. She tells his teacher that memory loss of the incident is normal, tells him that Shouto will need to be monitored for the next twenty-four hours and brought in if he\u2019s sick.\nThe police want a statement next and Aizawa makes them keep it brief, keep it simple, stands close to Shouto's side and glowers.\nThe villain he met was called Akumu, they tell him, and his Quirk was an Emitter that allowed him to create illusions. Nobody but the victim could be caught up in the illusions, they say, and that the man had no way of knowing what Shouto saw. Akumu is known for using the illusions as a distraction, giving him time to film his victims distress and then, once he\u2019s had his fill, kill them slowly.\nShouto doesn\u2019t mention that Akumu already knew Shouto\u2019s name and what his mother used to call him a long, long time ago.\nThey don\u2019t ask him what he saw.\nAizawa keeps a hand on his shoulder, on the back of his neck, on the small of his back, ushering him onward and grounding him to the world throughout it all.\nBy the time Shouto joins the rest of his class by the coach he\u2019s exhausted, eyes heavy and limbs heavier.\n\u201cShouto-kun!\u201d Midoriya\u2019s voice makes him glance up from his feet, heart picking up pace.\nHe sees the other boy over Aizawa\u2019s shoulder and, bar the bruise forming on his cheek, he seems to be unharmed. There\u2019s no blood, no snapped bones, no frothing mouth. There\u2019s only Midoriya, whole and well, brow furrowed in concern and eyes watering as he rushes over.\nShouto doesn\u2019t know what to say to the other boy, isn\u2019t sure he has any words left in him for today, bar, \u201cIzuku.\u201d\nHe can feel the midst of something wanting to well up in him, something thick and heavy, and his chest feels a bit like a glass with too many stones in it. He feels things start to spill over and he quickly pushes it all away. He\u2019d rather feel empty, feel hollow and raw, then deal with everything again.\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Midoriya demands as he takes Shouto in, hands hovering above Shouto\u2019s own like he wants to touch, but knows better. \u201cAre you okay? Where did you go? Did you get hurt- of course you did, what am I saying? Christ, your face Shouto. What happened? Do you need to sit down?\u201d\n\u201cMidoriya,\u201d Aizawa interrupts. Shouto notes that the rest of the class have crowded near them. They look concerned, look worried, as they throw glances between him and Aizawa. At the way Shouto\u2019s choosing to lean in towards their teacher instead of standing tall and independent. \u201cEveryone,\u201d Aizawa corrects. \u201cOnto the coach.\u201d\n\u201cBut...\u201d Kaminari starts. Shouto watches as he looks over their heads towards where he knows the icy ruin of the building stands.\n\u201cNo.\u201d Aizawa says flatly. \u201cOnto the coach. Now.\u201d\nNobody makes any move towards the coach though, unanswered questions and left over adrenaline hanging in the air like static flickering over a television. Shouto is tired though, is empty and vacant, and following easy instructions from Aizawa is what he needs right now.\nHe makes his way to the open doors of the coach without question and Midoriya trails after him, following Shouto almost automatically, which is nice, maybe.\nHe can feel eyes on his back, on his face, as he walks past his classmates, but he ignores them.\n\u201cYou heard Aizawa-sensei,\u201d Iida\u2019s voice rings out after a pause. \u201cOnto the coach.\u201d\nShouto takes a seat near the back, falling into it and blinking slowly out of the window. Midoriya sits next to him without question, body warm and breathing audible, fingers twitching and worry radiating from him.\nThe rest of the bus fills slowly, chattering and hushed voices filling the air, and when the coach rumbles to life the sounds fall into a familiar sort of white noise. Shouto probably owes them all something, especially Midoriya who had seemed so worried, so relieved and grateful, but he can\u2019t bring himself to say anything.\nHe leans his head on the window and stares outside listlessly, trying to ignore the image of his father, of Midoriya. Of his mother as she pressed her fingers into-\n\u201cHey,\u201d Midoriya says quietly. \u201cShouto-kun.\u201d\nFor some reason he hadn\u2019t expected the other boy to speak and the voice makes him flinch. He blinks owlishly at the older boy, lids heavy, and sees that Midoriya is twisted sideways on the seat so that he can face Shouto, one leg twisted up underneath him and his arm leaning on the headrest behind them, fingers stretched out towards Shouto.\nHe knows that logically, Midoriya is smaller than him, but his presence seems different sometimes.\nSometimes, Midoriya seems to fill up a room without even trying, his personality bright and shining and his smiles bigger and better than anything Shouto has ever seen before.\nTo see Midoriya (not Midoriya, he tries to remind himself. It wasn\u2019t him.) lying on the floor and struggling, his voice choked and desperate, whilst Shouto didn\u2019t do anything, couldn\u2019t do anything, was hard. To see him still and lifeless, emptied from everything that normally makes him so real, was harder. It hurt like a physical wound, like an ugly crack inside of him, icy coldness leaking and numbing everything.\nHe blinks at Midoriya again, eyes suddenly desperate. He drinks in the sight of the other boy, of his curled hair and freckled face. The Midoriya that had been on the floor wasn\u2019t quite right, Shouto notes. Even his own mind couldn\u2019t draw up the image of Midoriya perfectly. He doubts that anybody could ever capture the brightness of the other boy, the goodness that lurks behind his every fibre, the pureness of his being.\n\u201cI\u2019m here if you need me.\u201d Midoriya doesn\u2019t press for answers, doesn\u2019t demand them. He\u2019s giving Shouto a choice, an option. If he wants to talk then Midoriya will listen to him and if he wants to sit in silence, wants to be distracted from himself but not have to say a word, then he knows Midoriya will talk for the both of them. \u201cAlways.\u201d\nShouto still doesn\u2019t think he can talk without his voice cracking, something in him a bit more shattered then it was at the start of the day, but he reminds himself that he can fix that, that he can move on from what he saw if he lets himself.\nIt wasn\u2019t real, he tells himself. None of it was real.\nHe grabs Midoriya\u2019s hand before he can think much of it, palm clammy and fingers still shaking, squeezing once in a silent thank you. Midoriya blinks at him, eyes wide and then pleased, soft and gentle in the privacy of their seats.\nWhen he goes to let go Midoriya doesn\u2019t let him, instead tangling their fingers together and letting their hands rest on his thigh.\n\u201cWant me to talk?\u201d Midoriya asks, eyes observing Shouto, lingering on where his head hurts the most.\nShouto considers it for a second before nodding, something in him more desperate to hear the other boy then sit in silence, to be reminded that Midoriya is alive and well.\nShouto twists himself onto the seat so that he can face Izuku as the other boy starts to ramble on about an All Might documentary he watched the other day. He rests his head against the backrest and pulls his knees close to his chest, feeling everything in him fade away.\nHe watches Midoriya talk, feels the warmth of the other boy\u2019s hand encompassing his own, and does everything he can to not think about what happened.\nv.\nAfter the training centre incident Shouto finds himself struggling to fit back into his normal routines, back into what has become his normal life.\nEating is hard, focusing during class is harder, and\u00a0sleeping\u00a0is just \u2013 well, it\u2019s terrible.\nHis sleeping pattern has always been hit and miss at the best of times, but now, after the blood and the lies and the emotions he was forced to feel, he finds he can\u2019t close his eyes without picturing his father\u2019s sneering face or hearing his mother\u2019s biting words. Worse than that though is the image of Midoriya\u2019s face, all glassy eyed and slack jawed. Lifeless. Dead.\nIt\u2019s hard \u2013 harder than he thought it would be.\nLogically, he knows that what he saw wasn\u2019t real, that the words the night whispers to him are just recreations of a dream, echoes of a nightmare,\u00a0but.\n(butbutbut)\nIt had felt so real. So, so real.\nHe remembers the heat of his father\u2019s flames as they bit into his skin and he remembers the smell of his mother\u2019s perfume, the same one she wore during his childhood, floral and fresh and sweet. He remembers the feeling of her breath on his ear and the sound of his father snarling in anger.\nWorst of all is that he remembers-\n(dead, dead, dead, he\u2019sdead, hes-)\nEven though Midoriya is alive, Shouto saw him die. He remembers him dying.\nHe now what the other boy choking on his own blood sounds like and he knows what Midoriya\u2019s eyes look like as they flicker into nothingness.\nWhen it happened, when he saw it, his brain went into overload. His thoughts stuttered, mind halting, and error messages had flashed in front of his eyes as ice had poured from his soul. From his\u00a0heart. And then, to find out it was all fake, that everything he saw and felt was nothing but a lie, was like getting his brain rebooted. But things weren\u2019t right, weren\u2019t normal, and it feels like he\u2019s only able to run on bios.\nAll the motions he\u2019s used to are still there \u2013 everything he knows how to do is still accessible to him \u2013 but it\u2019s all so much more difficult to access and navigate through. It\u2019s not easy anymore and Shouto realises just how much he\u2019d come to rely on his life here at Yuuei, how much he\u2019d been relying on his routines.\nHe knows his struggle is becoming obvious too even though he\u2019s trying his best to pretend that things are normal.\nHis classmates hover and ask after him and then, when Shouto obviously doesn\u2019t give them the right answers, they ask after him through other people, question his closest friends and whisper about him when they think he\u2019s not paying attention.\nIt\u2019s like a hive of worry, a tessellation of whispers and concerned glances, all of which Shouto doesn\u2019t know what to do with.\nShouto\u2019s lost count of how many times he\u2019s walked into a room for a hush to settle over it. He\u2019s lost count of just how many times people have stared at him carefully and have tried to gently pry as if Shouto can give them the answers they want \u2013 as if he\u00a0knows\u00a0the answers they want. Even Aizawa lingers, asking Shouto to stay behind after class just to ask how he\u2019s doing.\u00a0I\u2019m fine,\u00a0Shouto says. It\u2019s the truth too, even if nobody seems to believe him.\nThings are different, sure. He feels out of place sometimes, clings too close to Midoriya and startles more easily. He might also be more hostile than usual too, something in him so unsettled that it makes him snap and want distance where others think he needs company.\nAnd yeah, okay, maybe sometimes he feels more like the old him, like the Shouto that first joined Yuuei with no friends and no connections and no idea how to deal with social normalities. The Shouto who didn\u2019t\u00a0want\u00a0to deal with social normalities, who didn\u2019t want friends or company or to be anything bar what his father was forcing him to be.\nIt\u2019s fine, though. He\u2019s fine. He\u2019s just slow on the reboot, maybe. He\u2019s just stuck in a loading screen whilst everything reconfigures to how it was before. He doesn\u2019t need people hovering or trying to push his buttons because it\u2019s a distraction he doesn\u2019t want \u2013 a distraction he doesn\u2019t\u00a0need.\nHe wants to settle back into his life on his own terms and to do that he needs to focus on relearning how to cope. He needs to work things through by himself. People can\u2019t force it, can\u2019t rip it from him, whatever it is they all seem to want. For him to be normal, probably. For him to be the him they knew.\nShouto wants that too, but it\u2019s not easy. He\u2019s trying though, one step at a time. The first thing he needs to do is to be able to close his eyes and not hear Midoriya choking on his own blood. Shouto needs to move on from the heat of his father\u2019s flames, from the feeling of his mother\u2019s fingers as she digs her nails into the raw skin around his left eye.\nHe needs to just \u2013 he needs to \u2013 he just needs to\u00a0breathe.\nBreathe.\nHe needs to breathe and stop thinking, stop listening to the choking sounds in his mind because thinking is making his ribs constrict around his lungs and his breathing sounds more like wheezing, like choking. It\u2019s too fast and too rough, and jesus christ he can\u2019t\u00a0breathe, can\u2019t think past the nightmare that had felt so, so real-\n\u201cShouto, hey.\u201d He blinks, the voice sounding like it\u2019s coming from underwater, and when he looks up it\u2019s into the concerned eyes of All Might. \u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d The older man says, voice a mix of soothing and firm, the latter growing more prominent as his teacher crouches down in front of him and instructs him to \u201cbreathe, yeah? It\u2019s all okay, you\u2019re okay. Just breathe with me, alright?\u201d\nBreathe as if it\u2019s just that easy. Breathe as if there isn\u2019t the heavy weight of what happened pressing down on his lungs. Breathe as if he didn\u2019t see Midoriya (his best friend, his first friend) die.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d All Might\u2019s voice sounds more distant, face blurring, and Shouto shuts his eyes to try and block it out. \u201cHey,\u201d All Might repeats. \u201cShouto- hey, don\u2019t-\u201d There\u2019s fingers on his shoulder then, firm yet gentle, and more around his wrist, lightly tugging his hands apart, his hands that were clenched and digging into each other, nails biting into flesh hard enough to sting.\nShouto feels like he\u2019s going to be sick, but All Might\u2019s grip is oddly grounding, long fingers gripping onto his shoulder firmly. He gasps in a breath and remembers to hold it for three beats this time before letting it out slowly, shakily.\n\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d All Might\u2019s voice says. \u201cGood boy.\u201d\nHis fingers squeeze in tandem with the breaths Shouto\u2019s trying to take and he focus\u2019 on the pressure, holding his breath for the squeeze and letting it out when All Might\u2019s fingers grow laxer.\nIt takes longer than Shouto wants to admit to get his breathing back under control. He blinks his eyes open to see All Might frowning down at him, dark eyes swimming with concern and compassion.\nEmbarrassment bubbles when he takes in their surroundings. He\u2019s slumped in an empty corridor, the light of the moon shining in through the windows further up the hall and bathing them in a subdued glow. All Might is kneeling in front of him, head ducked to meet Shouto\u2019s gaze.\nHis teachers face is still blurry, and it takes a second for Shouto to realise that there\u2019s tears in his eyes and a familiar burning feeling in his chest.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Shouto breathes out, clearing his throat when his voice comes out choked. \u201cSorry.\u201d he repeats, letting his eyes flutter shut and slumping further down onto the floor, his back digging into the skirting uncomfortably. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t apologise.\u201d All Might tuts. \u201cYou\u2019ve done nothing wrong, kid.\u201d\nI\u2019ve done nothing right either,\u00a0Shouto thinks.\u00a0I can never do anything right.\nHe thinks of being normal, of being able to sleep through the night and of not getting caught up in his own mind, and it makes something in him hurt. It makes something in him shrivel and burn, like petals in a wildfire.\nHe\u2019s never been normal. He\u2019s never been good enough.\nShouto considers saying it, considers letting anyone know that things are wrong. Something in him is curious just to see the reaction it\u2019d cause, to see whether anyone would agree with him or tell him he\u2019s wrong, but the bigger part of him knows better than to say it. He knows it\u2019s not normal to feel like this \u2013 has been trying his best to\u00a0not\u00a0feel like this.\nShouto keeps quiet, blinking his tired eyes open and taking another slow breath. \u201cThank you,\u201d Shouto says softly, forcing himself to sit up straight and push everything to the back of his mind.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d All Might offers a smile, small and gentle and still so concerned. \u201cAre you alright, Shouto?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d he says, maybe a bit too quickly. It\u2019s fine, though. Shouto is fine. He\u00a0is.\nAll Might is frowning at him and the older man looks like he wants to say something, wants to\u00a0do\u00a0something, so Shouto is quick to push himself into a standing position, something akin to panic clawing up his chest. All Might stands too, forehead creased and mouth opening to say something Shouto doesn\u2019t want to hear, so he quickly lets out a, \u201cI\u2019m honestly okay.\u201d and then, more honestly. \u201cJust tired.\u201d\n\u201cTired,\u201d All Might latches onto it just like Shouto hoped he would. \u201cI bet you are. It\u2019s late \u2013 I was surprised to see you here, kid. Do you need me to walk you back to your dorm room?\u201d\n\u201cNo thank you,\u201d Shouto offers a small bow, keeping his head ducked low as All Might let\u2019s out a small hum.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re sure, then.\u201d The older man says after a moments silence. \u201cRemember you can always talk to me, okay kid?\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d Shouto lies. \u201cThank you again, All Might.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo maybe Shouto isn\u2019t as fine as he thought he was. Maybe things are hard, maybe they\u2019re always too quick or too slow, and maybe his skin crawls and maybe he gets irritated over nothing, gets uneasy and hides it behind biting words and cold gazes, but it\u2019s not\u00a0that\u00a0bad.\n(Shouto repeats it again and again. It\u2019s not that bad, it\u2019s not that bad.)\nAizawa is staring at him intently today, gaze almost piercing, and Shouto knows without a doubt that All Might has spoken to the other man about what happened last night.\nShouto\u2019s good at avoidance though, years of ducking out of his father\u2019s sight leaving him an expert, and he doesn\u2019t find it difficult to quickly escape their homeroom when the bell rings. He keeps his head facing forward and let's his legs carry him far away from prying eyes and smothering concern.\n\u201cAre you that excited to go to English?\u201d Midoriya questions as he catches up, hurrying alongside him to keep up with Shouto\u2019s longer strides.\n\u201cYep,\u201d Shouto agrees, turning the corner and almost bumping into another student.\n\u201cWatch it,\u201d She snaps, dark eyes narrowing at him.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he mumbles, heart racing and trying to push down the annoyance he feels, but the girl he\u2019d almost walked over has already started to walk away.\n\u201cMaybe slow it down?\u201d Midoriya questions. Shouto hums, waiting until they\u2019re another hall away before he does, figuring that there\u2019s enough distance between him and Aizawa that he can afford to walk at his normal pace. He ignores the sigh of relief Midoriya lets out from next to him.\nThe other boy is frowning when Shouto glances at him, eyebrows furrowed and eyes \u2013 frustrated? Concerned?\u00a0Fond?\nShouto can\u2019t figure it out \u2013 doesn\u2019t want to figure it out, maybe \u2013 but then Midoriya catches his gaze and offers him a smile, bright and real and all for Shouto.\n\u201cMy legs can\u2019t keep up with yours,\u201d the older boy teases. \u201cSome of us are normal sized humans with normal sized legs, after all.\u201d\n\u201cWell, if I\u2019m normal sized then I guess you must be really small,\u201d Shouto returns easily. \u201cIt must be hard for you having to look up at the rest of the world.\u201d\n\u201cShouto-kun,\u201d Midoriya shoves him lightly, laughter behind his voice. \u201cYou\u2019re not\u00a0that\u00a0tall, you realise?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve still got time to grow more,\u201d Shouto sniffs, slowing to a stop outside their English classroom and twisting to lean against the wall so that he can look at Midoriya. The other boy isn\u2019t that much shorter really, but it\u2019s fun to wind Midoriya up sometimes. The other boys lips will press together with frustration and his cheeks will twitch as he tries to withhold a smile, eyes shining happily, and it makes something inside of Shouto soft. It makes something inside of him warm and syrupy slow. \u201cYou on the other hand?\u201d Shouto continues, ignoring the butterflies that flutter behind his navel. \u201cI think you\u2019ve reached your maximum height.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know that,\u201d Midoriya scoffs, bottom lip growing pale when he presses them together, chin dimpling and cheeks flushing. \u201cAnd even if I am smaller it doesn't matter because I\u2019m still stronger than you.\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d Shouto says, giving Midoriya a flat, haughty look. \u201cKeep telling yourself that.\u201d\n\u201cBut I am!\u201d Midoriya protests. \u201cThat\u2019s literally my Quirk, Shouto.\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d Shouto repeats, fighting back a smile. \u201cWhatever helps you sleep at night, Midoriya-san.\u201d\n\u201cIzuku,\u201d Midoriya corrects. \u201cHow many times do I need to tell you to call me Izuku?\u201d\n\u201cOne more time,\u201d Shouto says. And then, letting a small smile cross his lips, \u201cMidoriya-san.\u201d\nIt works a charm; Midoriya\u2019s bottom lip juts out and his nose scrunches slightly, eyes creasing as he glares at Shouto. It\u2019s cute, Shouto thinks, how annoyed he can make the other boy without really trying.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a pain in the ass,\u201d Midoriya nudges their feet together, lips twitching and eyes warm as he looks at Shouto. \u201cHonestly, you're the most frustrating person I know.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about Bakugou?\u201d Shouto asks.\nThe other boy pauses, looking up at ceiling in thought. \u201cMaybe-\u201d Midoriya cuts himself off, shaking his head and looking back at Shouto. \u201cNo, fine. You\u2019re right.\u201d Midoriya kicks at Shouto\u2019s foot again. \u201cBut,\u00a0you're the\u00a0second\u00a0most annoying person I know.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about my father?\u201d\n\u201cRight. Well, the third-\u201d\n\u201cMineta?\u201d\n\u201cI take it all back.\u201d Midoriya huffs. \u201cYou\u2019re the worst.\u201d\nWhen Midoriya looks at Shouto it\u2019s not with annoyance but with affection. It\u2019s with something kind and careful that makes Shouto feel like he\u2019s worth it. He likes being the one to make Midoriya huff, to make him pout and smile and laugh. He\u00a0likes\u00a0Midoriya.\nShouto likes Midoriya more than he should, likes the way the other boy can makes things easier and how he doesn\u2019t mind Shouto\u2019s oddness. Midoriya is so different to everything he\u2019s ever known, so bright and loud and vibrant in a world Shouto was convinced was nothing but dull.\nHe remembers Midoriya dying, is the issue.\nShouto remembers him with blood speckled lips and lifeless eyes.\nHe remembers -\n\u201cWe should go in.\u201d Midoriya interrupts his thoughts, voice steady when everything else isn\u2019t.\nShouto nods, following the other boy in as something inside of him turns cold at the memory of pale skin and lax limbs, as it turns bitter and angry and leaves him feeling alone and angry and\u00a0lost.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not like he can\u2019t move on from what happened. After a few weeks, it\u2019s easier to think through it, to ignore it and carry on.\nIt\u2019s more like he can\u2019t help but think back to it because it wasn\u2019t just what he saw that has him shaken, really. It\u2019s what the other man\u00a0knew.\nHe knew what Shouto\u2019s mother used to call him, despite not being able to see what Shouto saw. He knew something that nobody from the public could know which means that somebody close to his family must\u2019ve told him.\nShouto can\u2019t let it go, can\u2019t stop the words from echoing in his head. It makes him feel on edge, makes the air around him ripple as the words\u00a0my sweet little Shouto\u00a0sound in his mind like a siren before a hurricane hits, low and daunting and wrong.\nIt lurks behind each thought and eats away at him, gnawing and devouring until Shouto\u2019s half convinced he\u2019s going to end up driving himself crazy.\n\u201cShouto,\u201d Kirishima\u2019s voice repeats from behind his door. Shouto ignores it, staring at the wall of his room and trying to force his racing mind back into nothingness. \u201cYou sure you don\u2019t wanna come to the cinema with us?\u201d\n\u201cI told you,\u201d Another voice hisses when Shouto doesn\u2019t respond, annoyed and feminine. Ashido. \u201cWe should\u2019ve got Izuku up here.\u201d\n\u201cHe already tried,\u201d Kirishima responds, voice muffled by the door. \u201cI just thought he might\u2019ve changed his mind, maybe.\u201d\n\u201cHe might be asleep.\u201d Ashido tries to reason.\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d There\u2019s another knock, this one a bit louder than before.\nShouto ignores it, letting his eyes flutter shut and trying to piece together a puzzle with only a few of the pieces.\nFor Akumu to know, he must\u2019ve been told, and, as much as he tries to reason with himself otherwise, the only people to know what his mother called him as a child are his siblings or his father. His family.\nAnd if it was only them who knew, then it was only them who could tell Akumu.\nHe knows his father wouldn\u2019t say anything. His old man might be a bastard, but he values being a hero too much to conspire with villains.\nEndeavor is predictable and so set in his ways that Shouto can say without a doubt that if his father was ever close enough to Akumu to let out small, useless titbits of information like that, then Akumu would\u2019ve been dead long ago.\nThat leaves Fuyumi and Natsu. His siblings. The two people who Shouto shares a twisted, deep, understanding with. He doesn\u2019t trust many people, but he thought the basis of learning to trust again could come from them, maybe. That the meaning of family and love could come from getting to know them. He thought that they\u2019d be the only people to not judge him for the person he was shaped into, for the things he\u2019s done and the things he\u2019s wanted to do.\nIf even one of them has whispered truths and private knowledge to a\u00a0villain, then Shouto will-\nWell. He isn\u2019t sure what he\u2019ll do really.\nThe bitterness of doubt, of distrust, is thick in mind. He can taste it on his tongue, cloying and horrid, and he tries to take a deep breath to clear it.\n\u201cThe fuck are you two idiots doing?\u201d Bakugou\u2019s voice snaps from outside, jarring Shouto from his thoughts again.\n\u201cJust seeing if Todoroki wants to join us,\u201d Ashido says. \u201cMidoriya says Shouto hasn't left his room all weekend, let alone the campus.\u201d her voice sounds disappointed and Shouto wonders how him ignoring them can be\u00a0disappointing\u00a0of all things. He\u2019s not good company on a good day, let alone when his thoughts are dark and mood darker.\n\u201cAnd does he want to come?\u201d Bakugou asks.\n\u201cWell, he hasn\u2019t responded.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s your fucking answer then,\u201d Bakugou snorts. \u201cLeave him alone.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want him to feel alone,\u201d Ashido\u2019s words make something in Shouto fizzle and crack like the last embers of a flame flickering out of life.\nWhy do these people care about him when his own family can\u2019t? Is it that his family are flawed, or that Shouto himself is?\n\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t want to come, he doesn\u2019t have to.\u201d There\u2019s a pause before Bakugou lets out a frustrated groan. \u201cFor fucks sake, don't give me that look.\u201d There\u2019s a loud banging then as the door rattles in its frame from the force of the blows, forcing Shouto\u2019s eyes open from where they'd fluttered shut. \u201cOi, Halfie,\u201d Bakugou\u2019s voice calls. \u201cIf you\u2019re not fucking coming then fucking say\u00a0so.\u201d\n\u201cKatsuki,\u201d Kirishima scolds. \u201cDon\u2019t speak to him like that.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a fucking wilting flower,\u201d Bakugou snaps back. \u201cIf he\u2019s rude enough to fucking ignore you both then he\u2019s fine enough to be sworn at.\u201d\nShouto tilts his head at that, something in him reluctantly relieved that at least one person is treating him like normal.\nThe special treatment, the quiet voices and the gentle gazes make Shouto feel like a spectacle. He knows what happened \u2013 he knows that his father is having to pay out for the damage on the building \u2013 knows that he\u2019s been\u00a0off\u00a0(quiet, withdrawn, reserved) since it all \u2013 but he just needs normality, maybe.\nFor now, though, Shouto just wants to mope in all his self-created darkness, even if a small part of him craves the distraction of not being reminded of what he saw (of Midoriya dying and hearing his parents argue over who fucked him up the most. Of Akumu knowing things he shouldn\u2019t.)\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure that logic works.\u201d Ashido murmurs in a disapproving tone.\nBut, in a way, it does. \u00a0Shouto\u00a0is\u00a0being rude. He\u2019s been rude for a few weeks now. Although he doesn\u2019t like hearing it, Bakugou is right.\n\u201cFuck you. It does, and he knows it.\u201d Bakugou snaps, banging loudly on the door one more time. \u201cOi, shit head. Just tell them you\u2019re not going.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not going.\u201d Shouto repeats dully. There\u2019s a pause outside his door, a shuffling of feet, before Bakugou scoffs and walks off.\n\u201cMaybe next time, then?\u201d Kirishima asks, voice forcibly cheerful.\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d Shouto murmurs. He wishes he could escape from his own thoughts long enough to breathe evenly, to escape from his head and spend time with the people he\u2019s grown to enjoy. Everything feels wrong, though, his room too claustrophobic but the outside too open.\nHe assumes the other two don\u2019t hear his reply as the silence draws on but Shouto can\u2019t bring himself to repeat it. The two shadows under his door disappear after another moment and then Shouto\u2019s left alone, just like he wanted.\nHe\u2019s left alone with nothing but his thoughts and his unanswered questions and his doubt that's making him feel sick. But this is what he wants \u2013 what he\u00a0needs, he tries to convince himself.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nInsomnia is nothing new to Shouto, nor are nightmares. Still, it\u2019s been a while since his sleep has been this disturbed. Lately, if he sleeps at all, it ends in him jerking awake after a few hours, dreams fading into nothing and ice coating his floor.\nHe\u2019s growing sick of the tendrils of frost that creep up his walls every morning and the feeling of heavy eyelids, of sluggish limbs and slow reactions. \u00a0\nShouto just wants to snap back to normal now, is somewhat desperate too, but as the days drag on he\u2019s worried that he\u2019s forgotten what normal is. Maybe\u00a0this\u00a0is normal, now.\nMaybe icy floors and bitter, biting dreams are what was always going to become of him. Shouto\u2019s always doubted himself as a hero as he\u2019s never wanted to turn into his father, but he\u2019s also never wanted to be anything else.\nHis mother always thought he could be a hero and still be himself, still be Shouto. He likes saving people and doing good things, kind things. He enjoys helping people who need a hero and he loves feeling the rush of power that flows through his veins when he uses his Quirk. But.\nShouto has been trained hard and pushed down more times than he\u2019s gotten back up. He\u2019s been forced over the edge again and again and\u00a0again\u00a0just to be rebuilt into something stronger, something his father wanted to approve of. Maybe it did make Shouto stronger in a way, but it\u2019s also left him with thin cracks and fraying seams \u2013 left him desperate and raw and with walls so high that it\u2019s taken his classmates months to begin to see over them.\nThe cracks, the wire thin spiral breaks within him, don\u2019t need much pressure put on them to break, and all of the small things have built up without him noticing and Shouto\u2019s suddenly found himself with a heavy weight atop of his fragile bones and a pressure pressing over his heart.\nBreaking isn\u2019t new to him but breaking and not having his father there to put him back together is. He hates Endeavor, but the man knows strength, knows anger, and knows how Shouto works. He knows how to build him into a stronger version of himself. Shouto\u2019s stuck at Yuuei now though, with all this concern and gentleness that feels more weighted then his father\u2019s harshness ever did.\nSo maybe he was always going to break in the end. Maybe this was how it was always going to be.\nIce and fire and ash \u2013 a dust so fine that it scatters before anyone can catch it, caught in the breeze and swirling away.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cIs there anything I can do, Shouto-kun?\u201d Yaoyorozu asks him softly during class.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Shouto says quietly, eye\u2019s hesitantly flicking towards her face.\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d she bites her lip, dark eyes flicking to the front of the room where Aizawa is talking. \u201cI\u2019m worried about you.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be.\u201d Shouto doesn\u2019t want peoples worry or pity. He doesn\u2019t deserve it, not when everything feels like it\u2019s his fault.\nHe was the one who got separated, who couldn\u2019t fight his way out, who got himself stuck in his own head.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019ve just started Yuuei,\u201d she says out of blue.\nHe stares at her blankly, not too sure at what she\u2019s trying to get at. \u201cBecause it\u2019s a Monday?\u201d He guesses.\n\u201cAh, no, Shouto-kun.\u201d She tilts her head at him, long hair falling over her shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re just very\u2026 Reserved.\u201d\nOh.\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s fine,\u201d Yaoyorozu hurries to say. \u201cIt\u2019s fine if that\u2019s how you want to be. It\u2019s just, well. We\u2019re all here for you, you know?\u201d\nHe\u2019s confused again. Confused and \u2013 ashamed, maybe, for forgetting that he\u2019s somehow managed to get people to care for him.\n\u201cI know.\u201d Shouto says quietly, eyes falling to his notebook.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you do,\u201d Yaoyorozu says softly. \u201cBut I hope you realise it soon.\u201d\nShouto doesn\u2019t know what to say to that. He never knows what to say to anyone anymore.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cDinner.\u201d Iida proclaims loudly as he bursts through Shouto\u2019s door the next day.\nShouto rolls his head to look over at him from where he\u2019s lying on his bed, frowning at the sudden intrusion. He thought his door was\u00a0locked.\nThere\u2019s a key in Ida\u2019s hand though, one Shouto recognises as the master key Aizawa has. Something small like panic bursts behind Shouto\u2019s lungs but he ignores it. Ignores everything. Ignores Iida and his soft smile and stupidly determined eyes.\n\u201cDinner.\u201d Iida repeats as he walks over, dropping into a crouch next to Shouto\u2019s bed. \u201cCome on, Shouto-kun.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d Shouto says flatly. It\u2019s not a lie, either. He\u2019s\u00a0not\u00a0hungry. His stomach keeps twisting and turning as doubt and guilt claws at his insides, devouring him.\n\u201cYeah, I let you say that yesterday, but today I\u2019m afraid you don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d\nI never have a choice,\u00a0Shouto considers saying. It sounds melodramatic to his own ears though, too full of self-depreciation and with a deeper meaning that he\u2019ll never be willing to explain.\nIida, seeming unperturbed, pokes Shouto\u2019s shoulder with a small hum. The older boy still looks determined, mostly. A little worried, maybe. A little frustrated. Mostly determined though, with a hardness to his eyes and an edge to his smile.\n\u201cI\u2019ll drag you out,\u201d Iida warns when Shouto blinks at him in disdain. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do it, Shouto-kun, but I will. This has gone on long enough.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, this conversation?\u201d Shouto says shortly, annoyed at being disturbed in the midst of his longest self-pitying session to date.\n\u201cDon\u2019t test me,\u201d Iida\u2019s brows furrow together as his lips purse slightly. \u201cYou can join us for dinner or you can answer to Aizawa-sensei who, by the way, is very doubtful of why Uraraka needed this key.\u201d\n\u201cYou lied to Aizawa?\u201d Shouto asks, reluctantly curious.\n\u201cNot me,\u201d Iida shakes his head, looking pained. \u201cUraraka and Tsu. They said Izuku had gotten stuck in his room.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not just tell him the truth?\u201d Shouto asks in confusion.\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t want Aizawa finding out about...\u201d Iida trails off, eyes growing soft as they look at Shouto. They\u2019re not pitying, which is a nice change, but Shouto doesn\u2019t know if he deserves the kindness being shown to him.\nHe half wants to hear the other boy call him out on his isolation and unhealthy behaviour. He wants to hear the biting words and feel something other than the gnawing doubt that\u2019s lingering inside his mind, but Iida just offers a small smile and says, \u201cCome to dinner.\u201d instead.\nShouto lets out a slow breath, feeling his ribs tighten around his lungs and the lump that won\u2019t leave his throat constrict, before he pushes himself up into a sitting position.\nHis head spins and his stomach twists and when the flashing lights fade from his eyes Iida looks like he wants to say something, looks like he wants to do something.\u00a0Snap me out of it, Shouto thinks, the thought new and sudden.\u00a0Please make me stop,\u00a0he thinks. Shouto feels the thoughts burn, feel them bubble and scorch, but he realises how true they are, how much he needs someone to force him out of his own head.\nShouto has never been good at helping himself, has always relied on his mother's gentle support and then, when that wasn\u2019t available, his father's harsh grip and hardened words. He needs something new here though. He needs to find a way to stop getting lost in himself and falling back into old habits. Bad habits.\nIida grips his arm, touch gentle but firm, and tugs. \u201cCome on,\u201d he says, still so determined and kind when Shouto doesn\u2019t deserve it. \u201cDinner, Shouto-kun.\u201d\nAs it turns out, dinner consists of Iida, Tsu, Uraraka, and Midoriya ordering takeout and forcing Shouto to join them at the kitchen table as they all eat.\nThey don\u2019t force him to talk which is \u2013 nice, maybe.\nThey don\u2019t seem to mind his silence nor his lack of appetite. They don\u2019t pick him apart or comment on what\u2019s happened, on what is happening right now. Instead they talk amongst themselves and listen to Shouto when he makes a comment, let him stay silent when he has nothing to say.\n\u201cStay for a movie?\u201d Uraraka asks him quietly when everyone\u2019s clearing the table and Shouto\u2019s still picking at his steamed broccoli.\nShouto offers her a shrug, stomach fuller then it\u2019s been all week and mind clearer because of it.\n\u201cPlease?\u201d She pushes, eyes big and brown and genuine, a sweet, hopeful smile on her face. \u201cYou can sit next to Deku.\u201d\nShouto ignores the heat that rushes to his face, firmly keeping his gaze on his plate as his ears turn red. He pinpoints Midoriya\u2019s voice to his left, bright and familiar.\nMidoriya is chatty during movies, Shouto has learnt. He keeps up a quiet commentary, sometimes just mumbling to himself and other times asking the person next to him for their opinion on whatever he\u2019s talking about. He goes off on tangents, talks about the actors or the director, points out costumes that he loves and ones that he hates and tries to pinpoint the location of the film. Shouto finds himself oddly endeared by it all. Bakugou ends up threatening everyone when he sits within five feet of Midoriya\u2019s voice.\n\u201cFine.\u201d Shouto agrees, trying to ignore how eager a part of him is to hear Midoriya talk for the next hour or so.\nUraraka\u2019s smile brightens, a triumphant glint to her eyes.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen Shouto wakes up the next morning it\u2019s not to ice and a boneset chill but instead to a gentle warmth and the pressure of something on his head. He blinks his eyes open, confused but content, and stares curiously at the black object in front of his face.\nIn the haze of being half awake he lets himself lull in the gentle warmth that surrounds him, slowly gaining his bearings and letting the world come into focus piece by piece.\nIt\u2019s not often, if at all, he wakes up feeling like this \u2013 warm and happy and content. It's different, a good different. Shouto\u2019s never been one to be able to laze around though, so, as tempting as it is to just fall back asleep, he forces his eyes open and stretches out his neck, letting it click with satisfaction.\nThe pressure on his head shifts too and Shouto tenses when he realises the weight is from a\u00a0hand,\u00a0from fingers resting gently atop his head. There's a blanket covering him and the black object in front of him suddenly comes into a clarifying focus.\nIt's a black hoody. Midoriya\u2019s black hoody, to be exact, and when Shouto tilts his head up he sees Midoriya\u2019s sleeping face, head tilted awkwardly to one side and breaths deep and steady.\nShouto doesn't know what to do \u2013 doesn't know how to cope with\u00a0this.\nThis: the knowledge that Midoriya has stayed downstairs on the sofa just to let Shouto sleep. That he\u2019s stayed here with his head tilted at an angle which will leave him sore when he wakes up. Midoriya\u2019s hand, gentle and warm, cradling Shouto\u2019s head in sleep as if he's something precious, something worthy of such an action.\nThis: the faint memory of Midoriya\u2019s rambling voice stuttering off when Shouto\u2019s head had slumped onto his shoulder. The gentle arm that had curled around his shoulders and pulled him in closer and then, sometime later, shifting him downward into a more comfortable position so that Shouto\u2019s head was in his lap. Fingers carding through his hair and lulling him back to sleep.\nThis: waking up feeling more rested and more calm then he has in weeks \u2013 in\u00a0months.\u00a0Waking up with his nose pressed into Midoriya\u2019s stomach, the smell of his laundry detergent \u2013 something flowery and fresh \u2013 surrounding his senses and making his heart flutter. Feeling warm instead of cold and feeling content instead of restless.\nThis: something warm and soft and bright filling up his chest, his lungs, his\u00a0heart. Something that makes Shouto feel happy and cared for. It's such a strange feeling, a nice feeling, and Shouto wants to stay here curled into Midoriya for the rest of the day. He wants Midoriya to wake up, wants to feel the other boys\u2019 fingers curl into his hair and hear his sleepy \u201cmorning Shouto-kun\u201d.\nHe wants this forever, he realises. He wants Midoriya forever.\nThe thought scares him almost as much as everything else that's been haunting his mind and Shouto pushes himself upright, ignoring the voice inside of him that protests, carefully extracting himself from Midoriya.\nShouto doesn't do soft feelings. He doesn't do happiness and warmth and \u2013 and\u00a0love.\nHis limbs stand him up on auto-pilot as his mind whirls and shakes with the knowledge that somehow, someway, Shouto has fallen in love. Love, of all things.\nBeing affectionate and positive is everything he isn't. Is everything he wants to be, he realises. It\u2019s everything he thinks he might be when Midoriya forces his walls down and shows him the world as he sees it: bright and vibrant and so full of life and goodness.\nThe age-old routine of getting up and making himself breakfast kicks in and his body heads towards the kitchen, mind spinning as his hands reach for a glass and turn on the tap.\nI love Midoriya,\u00a0Shouto thinks as he watches the water swirl down the drain. His hand is trembling, he notes, and ice is licking at his fingertips. Everything in his mind narrows down to Midoriya, flashes of dark hair and green eyes appearing. Shouto thinks of Midoriya\u2019s bright smile, of his pleased eyes, and of his flushed skin as he laughs.\nHis eyes flutter shut as something warm unfurls in his chest, a flower blooming into life.\nThe cloud that's been looming over him lifts and he takes in a slow breath, the smell of the dorm invading his nose as the morning sun shines through the kitchen blinds and warms his skin.\nIt feels easier to breathe for a moment, the panic and the doubt and the guilt lifting for long enough for him to see that through all the darkness he's managed to find happiness. That maybe he had always had happiness, that he was the only thing standing in his way of being normal. Of being him.\nI love Izuku, he thinks.\nThe image that's been haunting him for weeks flashes in his mind, Midoriya\u2019s pale skin and bloodied lips, but Shouto shakes the image away. Instead he pictures Midoriya\u2019s expression when he\u2019d caught sight out Shouto leaving the training centre, all pleased and concerned and gentle. He pictures Midoriya when Shouto winds him up, flushed and pouting but with eyes that dance with light. He pictures Midoriya when he fights, green lightning twirling over his skin as power pours from his soul, eyes alight with a burning desire that leaves Shouto breathless.\nThe guilt within him starts to wane as he remembers that Midoriya is strong and alive and, if anything, he's always the one protecting Shouto. Even now when Shouto is moody and absent the other boy had been trying to protect Shouto from himself.\nHe's jolted from his thoughts when arms slide around his waist, a warm body pressing flush against his back.\nWater is still pouring from the tap, Shouto\u2019s hand quivering with emotion as he clutches onto the glass with a white knuckled grip. He knows it's Midoriya behind him without turning around, can smell his soapy shampoo and the arms that are wrapped around him are strong and familiar.\n\"What are you doing?\" Shouto asks quietly, heart beating fast and mind finally slowing to a halt.\n\"Hugging you.\" Midoriya returns in a patient voice. His arms tighten around Shouto's waist and he presses his forehead more firmly against his back. \"You know it's a hug, Shouto-kun. Don't play dumb.\u201d\nShouto takes a breath, not knowing how to react. \u201cWhy are you hugging me?\u201d he asks, voice smaller than he wants, more confused and lost than he wants to sound.\n\u201cYou need a hug.\u201d Midoriya says simply.\n\u201cNeed?\u201d\n\u201cYep.\u201d Midoriya gently nudges his head against Shouto\u2019s back. \u201cI should've hugged you from the moment you came out of that stupid building, but I didn't want to overwhelm you.\u201d Midoriya says into Shouto\u2019s top, breath warm and voice slightly muffled. \u201cAnd then I should've hugged you every day after until you stopped looking so sad. I thought space was what you needed, though, but I've now decided that you need this more.\u201d His arms squeeze Shouto's waist, forehead digging into his back, and Shouto feels a calmness settling over him.\nHe takes another breath, this one easier than before.\u00a0I love you, Shouto thinks.\n\u201cI'm scared,\u201d is what he says.\n\u201cOf what?\u201d Midoriya asks quietly.\n\nOf everything. Of nothing.\n\nIt's easy here in the early hour of the morning to take another deep breath and let it out. This time he lets the tension flow from his body and to allows his ribs to finally loosen their hold from around his lungs. The downstairs is empty, and everything stills for a moment, the running water seeming to pause and the shakiness that\u2019s been following him around departing. He takes another breath then, deeper than the last, easier, and lets the words flow, let\u2019s himself finally admit it, as the world starts back up again.\nHe talks and talks and\u00a0talks, voice steady and then not so steady. He talks until his words run dry, finding it simple to say when he doesn\u2019t need to look at Midoriya, and his heart burns from the relief of it, from the pain of it. Once he\u2019s finished, throat dry and mind light, he lets himself slump backwards into Midoriya\u2019s hold, his back pressing against a firm chest and strong arms tightening around his waist in a soft squeeze.\nThe older boy doesn\u2019t talk for a while, but Shouto doesn\u2019t take offensive. If anything, it\u2019s nice to be standing here in the aftermath, his body finally hollowed from the extra weight he\u2019d been carrying and his heart lighter than before.\nHis hands had turned the tap off whilst he was talking, had fiddled with the empty glass and pulled at the loose thread in his sleeve, but they grow still now. Shouto looks out of the window and lets the warmth of the sun soak into him, gently melting away the ice that had built up under his skin and around his bones. Midoriya\u2019s chest rises and falls behind him, very much alive, and Shouto finally lets himself thaw. He takes another breath and lets himself melt into something more malleable, something more accepting.\n\u201cShouto-kun,\u201d Midoriya says from behind him, voice choked and angry and yet still so kind. His arms tighten, face pressing between Shouto\u2019s shoulder blades as he lets out a shaky breath. Shouto doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019d been expecting from Midoriya, but it hadn\u2019t been the quiet \u201cthank you.\u201d that\u2019s pressed into his skin. \u201cFor telling me. Thank you.\u201d\nI don\u2019t want your thanks,\u00a0is Shouto\u2019s initial response, biting and afraid of pity, but he knows that this isn\u2019t pity. Midoriya doesn\u2019t do that, doesn\u2019t treat Shouto like broken goods or a shadow of something he was. The other boy never offers small\u00a0sorry\u2019s\u00a0to the tales of Shouto\u2019s life, but instead points out how good Shouto is, how strong he is. There is never any pity \u2013 only genuine emotion, genuine thanks.\nMidoriya has probably been waiting weeks for Shouto to break, has probably been curious and hurt and lost, but he\u2019s also been so patient with Shouto, so\u00a0so\u00a0patient and\u00a0so\u00a0accepting and just \u2013 just understanding. He understands how Shouto\u2019s works and would\u2019ve probably been willing to wait months, maybe years, until Shouto was ready to tell him the truth.\nIt's not like how his father would help him but it\u2019s better, maybe, this way.\nIt\u2019s weird having Midoriya as his friend, Shouto thinks. It\u2019s weird having a friend at all, really, but things are always so different with Midoriya. Always such a good kind of different.\n(I love you, he thinks.)\nShouto shifts and Midoriya shifts with him, arms dropping to his hips as Shouto twists to stand face to face with the older boy. Midoriya looks up at him with such affection, green eyes big and earnest and kind, and Shouto wants so badly to tell Midoriya everything and nothing at the same time.\n\u201cHe knew what my mother used to call me,\u201d Shouto repeats again. It\u2019s been driving him crazy for days, but it feels different to say it in the morning light, everything soft and still around them. \u201cHe knew. Somebody told him.\u201d He remembers his mother's voice overlapping Akumu\u2019s and feels his eyes sting.\nMy sweet Shouto.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll find out who told him,\u201d Midoriya murmurs, voice gentle and firm. \u201cWe can work it out, Shouto-kun. Together.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n+i.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you happy, Shouto-kun?\u201d Midoriya asks, as per their routine.\nHe\u2019s not looking at Shouto when he says it, so he misses the pinched expression that overcomes Shouto\u2019s face. Instead, Midoriya is looking through the possessions on Shouto\u2019s desk, absently picking up Japanese ornaments whilst Shouto sits on his bed, back against the wall, and watches him.\nShouto thinks about the question, like he always does, and isn\u2019t sure how to respond to it.\nIs he happy? Or is he sad? Is there something between \u2013 something fleeting and lost yet still bright - that could define what he feels.\u00a0\nShouto doesn\u2019t know the answer \u2013 can't find a way of pinpointing all the different emotions inside of him and putting them into words that make sense to the outside world.\u00a0\nMidoriya chances a glance at him, raising his eyebrows in silent question, face open and imploring and everything Shouto has never known how to deal with.\nMidoriya does this, is the thing. He encourages Shouto to think and to feel and is genuinely interested in his answers. It drives Shouto crazy sometimes, makes him feel useless and confused, but still. Midoriya will ask with nothing but honest curiosity and Shouto won\u2019t lie to him in return.\nSo, Shouto thinks and he tries to find an answer, but the question can often feel more overwhelming than it does normal.\nHappiness seems like a somewhat abstract expression to him, something commonly felt by all but not something that everyone feels the same.\nSo, when Midoriya asks the question, does he want to know if Shouto is happy? Is that really what the question is? Or does the other boy want to know if Shouto fits into his interpretation of happy?\nWhat is the right answer here \u2013 the honest one \u2013 and what is the trap for him to fall into?\u00a0\nShouto doesn\u2019t know what to say, finding himself stuck on not wanting to say something wrong but not wanting to ignore the question either.\nBefore Shouto\u2019s panic can rise over the question, though, Midoriya takes his silence as answer enough.\nShouto watches as the other boy\u2019s face falls slightly, eyebrows flattening and lips twitching downward, before the same determined expression overcomes him. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to answer,\u201d Midoriya falls onto the bed beside him, flapping his hand in the air as if to wipe away the question.\nAs if it\u2019s that easy. As if it\u2019s okay that Shouto has no answer for him today.\u00a0\nMidoriya smiles at him before stretching across the bed like he owns it, placing his head in Shouto\u2019s lap, the weight solid and warm. Shouto looks down at him, bemused and trying his best not to blush, and Midoriya offers him a brighter smile in return. \u201cI remember All Might telling me this thing the other day,\" Midoriya starts, the conversation easily flipped from his previous question, and Shouto hesitantly lets a hand fall onto the other boy\u2019s hair as he begins to ramble about something he spoke to his mentor about.\u00a0\nFor Midoriya, it is that easy to move on. To wipe the question away and go on, to move forward.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShouto keeps thinking about it. Happiness.\nMidoriya keeps asking him about it.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you happy, Shouto-kun?\u201d\nIs he?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShouto had never thought about how secluded his life used to be until he was suddenly thrown into a world of voices and vibrance and colour.\nHe\u2019d never questioned his father\u2019s harshness, not really. He had resented it, sure, but he had also long accepted it for what it was, had accepted his father for who he was. He hadn\u2019t questioned his sibling\u2019s absence either because, although not seeing them had been lonely, it had been normal. Normal for all of them \u2013 not just for Shouto.\nThere were a few odd moments that stood out to him, moments where things seemed different from what he knew. Laughter, smiles, hugs.\nHe hadn\u2019t known that those three things were normal for others until he\u2019d been allowed to go to school and by then he\u2019d been so messed up from his childhood that he hadn\u2019t known how to act around it \u2013 had instead learnt to build up a harder exterior and develop a glare to rival his father's. Any way to ensure that people stayed away from him.\nGrowing up, the moments of happiness had been so few and far between that they stand out to him, even now. The coolness of his mother\u2019s hand as it rubbed over his back, her voice quiet and soft as she read a book to him. The way his siblings had laughed and played with him before his Quirk had really shown itself for what it was, back when his father\u2019s focus had been Touya and Touya alone. His father smile, prideful and possessive. The way his lips stretched and his eyes gleamed when the flames had licked along Shouto\u2019s skin as ice crawled its way across his face. His mother sneaking Fuyumi and him out of the house for a rare visit to a city, all of them giddy with the adrenaline of breaking the rules and then, once his mother had been long gone, the way his sister had offered him small, secret smiles as they snuck out to ice cream parlours late, late at night.\nRarer still were the hugs. Coddling wasn\u2019t something tolerated in the Todoroki household and so none of them had grown to be tactile. They weren\u2019t desperate for affection because it wasn\u2019t something that had ever been offered to them, wasn\u2019t something they were able to get used to.\nStill, that doesn\u2019t mean there wasn\u2019t the odd moment. Shouto can recall the rare hugs growing up, the rare touches that weren\u2019t just firm and bruising, but instead spoke of a kindness that he struggles to fit in with the image of his family.\nHis mother hugging him as he cried, holding him with a forced calmness and humming under her breath to try and soothe him.\nTouya curling a sympathetic arm around his shoulders after Shouto had finished a gruelling session with their father, face a mixture of pity, jealousy and protectiveness.\nNatsu clutching him with something raw and desperate as their mother was restrained, Shouto\u2019s face burning and melting and --\nThe people at Yuuei hug and touch and cling without question and without reason.\nShouto doesn\u2019t need to be in pain for somebody to latch onto him, but if he was in pain \u2013 like when his classmates had seen him shaken, ghostly, and wrong in the aftermath of Akumu \u2013 he knows that they'll crowd in closer and offer comfort and kindness over the hesitant glances and distance he had long grown used to. It was confusing \u2013 disorientating, even\u2013 and Shouto doesn\u2019t really know how to deal with it.\nNo, Shouto corrects himself. He didn\u2019t know how to deal with it at first.\nNow, it\u2019s more like a kindness that he is slowly learning to accept \u2013 to appreciate. To give in return.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cShouto,\u201d Kirishima complains, leaning more of his weight against Shouto\u2019s back. \u201cShouto.\u201d\nKarishma\u2019s group have just finished their training session and, for some reason, the other boy had made a beeline for Shouto once they'd left the course, his face as red as his hair and skin glistening with sweat.\nKirishima had wasted no time in draping himself dramatically across Shouto\u2019s back with a groan, arms flopping lifelessly over Shouto\u2019s chest, before proceeding to bemoan his imminent death.\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna die, Shouto.\u201d\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d Shouto replies calmly for the third time, eyes tracking where Ashido, Kota, Jirou, and Kaminari are racing through the course Cementoss has set up for them.\n\u201cI am.\u201d Kirishima insists, chin digging into Shouto\u2019s shoulder and breath hot on his face. \u201cI\u2019m gonna die, like, right now, and I don\u2019t think anybody can do anything about it.\u201d\nShouto had caught onto the other boys plan a few minutes into his complaints.\u00a0\n\u201cI could speed it up,\u201d Shouto offers, continuing to play ignorant instead of giving into the other boys subtle hints. He lets his left side grow hot, holding back a smirk when Kirishima shouts and shoves himself away.\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t be mean to me,\u201d the other boy pouts, choosing to crowd in close to Shouto\u2019s right side instead. \u201cYou have the ability to help preserve my life, you\u2019re not supposed to try and end it.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not a fridge,\u201d Shouto lets fire lick across his fingers, the flames bright enough to draw in Kirishima\u2019s gaze. \u201cGo annoy someone else.\u201d\n\u201cOf course you\u2019re not a fridge!\u201d Kirishima gushes, reaching up to tug on a strand of Shouto\u2019s hair. \u201cYou\u2019re my friend, Shouto. My nice, cold friend. My cold, cold friend who wants to keep me cool and save me from death's door.\u201d\nShouto hums noncommittedly, noticing not for the first time that occurrences like this have been happening more and more.\nPeople have been crowding in close and reiterating the fact that they\u2019re his friend, that they like him, and Shouto isn\u2019t too sure when everybody decided that he needed to hear the words, but he\u2019s humbled by it nonetheless. More so than the action, more so than being humbled, Shouto has noticed that he\u2019s stopped flinching away from others.\nHe no longer tenses when somebody presses in close to his side or grabs onto his arm in excitement, doesn\u2019t duck away when somebody kicks his foot at the table. People touching him \u2013 once unusual and unappreciated, once longed after but unsure about \u2013 is now accepted.\nMore than, accepted, maybe. If anything, Shouto can say that he likes it, the closeness. The easy affection.\u00a0\nHe likes hugs because Shouto, under all his hard exterior and initial unease, is soft.\nShouto likes people and enjoys being liked in return. He likes his classmates with their easy affection and natural reactions. Shouto likes and is liked.\nAs his brain registers the thought of liking people - of people liking him - his eyes automatically flick over to Midoriya.\nThe other boy is chatting animatedly to Uraraka and Iida, eyes bright and hands waving around wildly as he talks about something Shouto can\u2019t make out over the sound of the class. Midoriya\u2019s eyes slip though and he catches Shouto looking - always, always catches Shouto looking, as if Shouto\u2019s gaze is magnetic to his own - and for a second Midoriya\u2019s face grows impossibly brighter. A sunshine smile that makes Shouto feel special and warm and soft. Soft soft soft.\nWithout his permission, Shouto can feel his own lips twitching upwards in return as his cheeks grow warm.\nMidoriya waves, dropping whatever gesture he was trying to portray to Uraraka and Iida, and Shouto lets his smile grow a bit bigger, feels his own fingers twitch at his side as if they want to wave in return.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Kirishima says. snapping Shouto\u2019s attention back toward him. He\u2019s watching Shouto with curiosity, red eyes big and pleased. \u201cNice smile,\u201d the other boy comments, digging a finger into Shouto\u2019s warm cheek.\u00a0\n\u201cShut up.\u201d Shouto says without any real heat. Well, no heat in his voice, at least. His face on the other hand seems to be on fire at being caught smiling at Midoriya. Of not minding the thought of someone seeing him smiling at Midoriya.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re so prickly,\u201d Kirishima comments, making Shouto snort internally. Prickly is the exact opposite of how he feels lately. Things are - they haven\u2019t been easy, but they\u2019ve not been bad. They\u2019ve been good, really. Great. Maybe even nice.\nIs he happy? Shouto wonders. Is this what being happy is?\nShouto has felt happy, he thinks, despite Akumu and the secrets that lie within the other man\u2019s knowledge. Shouto has been able to move on, to press forward and to push the dark swirling mess inside of him away. But it still lingers on some days, all biting winds and harsh seas that are untameable at times, but Shouto is trying his best to not let it define him.\nHe\u2019s trying to let himself be happy. To learn how to be so.\u00a0\nBeing with Midoriya, seeing the other boy smile and drop everything just to pay Shouto the slightest bit of attention, makes him think that, despite everything, he could be happy.\nHeart warm and Midoriya\u2019s smile on his mind, the world suddenly seems brighter. Warmer. Enough so that Shouto decides to indulge Kirishima by letting his Quirk flare up, the air around them instantly cooling.\n\u201cOh, thank god,\u201d Kirishima groans, crowding in closer to Shouto\u2019s side when he lets it a light layer of frost grow across his skin. \u201cYou\u2019re the best, did you know that?\u201d Kirishima comments without thought, temple pressing against Shouto\u2019s forearm and eyes fixed on where their classmates are displayed on the screen.\nAnother thing, Shouto has noticed, is the way his classmates will drop compliments and dramatic declarations over the smallest of things.\u00a0\nKirishima feels overheated? Death is the only outcome of his problem. Shouto being able to cool him down? Shouto is suddenly the best.\nHas Shouto ever been someone\u2019s best before?\nHe wasn\u2019t even the best in class, the weight of his father's disappointment heavier than the second-place medal that was placed around his neck all those years ago.\nThank you, Shouto wants to say, but he feels like that would make the situation weird.\nNot that anybody really minds Shouto\u2019s oddness when it comes to social interaction, but Shouto minds it. So, instead of voicing his appreciation, he decides to grab Kirishima\u2019s empty discarded water bottle and fill it with icy water, trying his best not to look too embarrassed or delighted when it causes the other boy to loudly sing Shouto\u2019s praises once again.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo, Shouto has friends. Friends. Plural. He has friends, has people who like him and who seek out his company, and people who offer him affection without thought.\nHe has friends and Shouto thinks that maybe he is happy.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nUraraka has breakfast with him every day now. Sometimes it\u2019s just the two of them, but most of the time it\u2019s with Iida and Midoriya too.\nUraraka had asked him to join her in trying all the different breakfast foods available a few weeks ago and he\u2019d accepted the offer, surprised but pleased by her asking. He wasn\u2019t too sure why she\u2019d come to Shouto of all people, considering Shouto is known for being a picky eater, but he\u2019d felt too oddly endeared by her offer to turn it down.\nSo, they try out different foods. Some are new to Shouto but familiar to Uraraka, and some are vice versa, and then there's a few dishes that are new to them both. They try international dishes and traditional dishes and some breakfasts Uraraka decides to create a hybrid plate for them.\nIt's a challenge, for sure, and Shouto never really thought that there were that many breakfast foods, but every day proves him wrong.\u00a0\nA few weeks go by and it\u2019s \u2013 well, it\u2019s an experience. Shouto realises that he\u2019s fussier than he thought and Uraraka has taken it as a challenge to find something unique that he loves.\nShouto still finds himself wondering why Uraraka had asked him of all people, never quite being able to figure it out, especially when Shouto picks at more meals then he finishes.\u00a0\nIn the end, Shouto decides to stop thinking on it and just outrightly ask Midoriya instead, knowing that the other boy will have the answer as to why Uraraka waits by the dorm entrance for him every morning with bright eyes and excited smile.\nMidoriya blinks at him when he asks, letting out a startled laugh before he seems to realise that Shouto is serious. \u201cShouto,\u201d Midoriya says, voice fond and endeared, \u201cshe asked you because you\u2019re one:\" he begins to list on his fingers, \"her friend, and two, the only one kind enough to actually go along with her crazy plan.\u201d\nShouto focuses on keeping his face carefully impassive at the other boys\u2019 words, not knowing how to feel about the implication that he's kinder than anyone at something.\u00a0\n\u201cShe asked Iida after you\u2019d agreed, but he said no, and I told her not to bother asking when she turned toward me. It\u2019s \u2013 I love her, don\u2019t get me wrong - but watching you both eat some of that stuff makes me glad for saying no.\u201d\nShouto hums, tilts his head, and still doesn\u2019t really get it. Uraraka asked him because she thinks he\u2019s kind?\nShouto has been called many things, but that has never been one.\nStill, when Uraraka pulls him over towards the international buffet the next morning, he lets her without question.\nThey\u2019re serving American fruit pancakes today with a side of fried chicken which \u2013 well. What are they thinking? It\u2019s a bizarre choice of breakfast food in Shouto\u2019s opinion and he refuses to try the chicken with the pancakes, so he and Uraraka settle on a plate of just the pancakes instead.\nAll of it looks a bit too greasy for his liking and it reeks of sugar, but he keeps quiet as he plates up two stacks for Uraraka and him, listening to the shorter girl try to explain all the different American traditions she's seen on TV.\nIn the end, Shouto decides that the pancakes are disgusting. They're not fluffy and are way too sugary and some of them had banana\u2019s \u2013 of all things, banana\u2019s \u2013 inside of them. Uraraka suggests adding more maple syrup to drown out the taste of them and he\u2019s left staring at a plate of sugary sweetness that he refuses to eat.\n\u201cThis,\u201d Shouto mutters when Uraraka runs to get herself a drink, \u201cis the worst breakfast we\u2019ve had.\u201d\n\u201cYou could tell her that,\u201d Iida points out. \u201cYou could end your pain and save the both of you from needing fillings.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Shouto says flatly, shaking his head. \u201cIf she wants to do this then I\u2019ll do it with her. Nobody deserves to go through this much syrup alone.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re so sweet.\u201d Midoriya says unthinkingly.\nShouto blinks at the other boy and Midoriya\u2019s eyes widen in return, as if he just realised what he said. \u201cUh,\u201d Midoriya breathes, cheeks growing red. \u201cUm.\u201d\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Shouto says politely, voice steady despite his own racing heart.\nMidoriya thinks he\u2019s sweet. God, Shouto is never gonna forget that.\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Midoriya answers, eyes dropping shyly.\n\u201cJesus,\u201d Iida mutters. \u201cYou guys are gonna make me sick.\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s being sick?\u201d Uraraka asks as she drops into the seat beside Shouto. \u201cIs it the pancakes, Shouto? Are they really that sickly?\u201d\nShouto considers saying yes, we\u2019re going to need to set a dentist if we eat any more, but then he looks at her big concerned eyes and glances at the water bottle she's grabbed for him whilst getting her own, and decides that it won\u2019t hurt to skim the truth.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Shouto tells her. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be sick \u2013 Iida was just exaggerating.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d Uraraka\u2019s smile lights up her entire face. \u201cBecause I was thinking\u2026\u201d\nAs he listens, he tries his best to keep the disgust off his face as Uraraka suggests adding chicken to the mix. Iida and Midoriya snicker at him, but not with malice. Instead, the both of them look oddly proud. Fond. As if Shouto is good for sticking by Uraraka despite his own opinions.\nAnd if Midoriya thinks he\u2019s sweet because of it \u2013 well. That\u2019s just a bonus, isn\u2019t it?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHappiness is abstract in way, Shouto still thinks. It\u2019s unique to every person.\nBut, he begins to realise, when it comes to actually being happy - to feeling it without having to think about it - then it makes answering Midoriya\u2019s question so much easier.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIida walks with him back to the dorms every day without fail.\nSometimes they\u2019ll walk in an easy silence, arms brushing every so often and Iida smiling whenever Shouto catches his gaze. Most of the time, though, the taller boy likes to talk. He doesn\u2019t ramble like Midoriya and Uraraka, his conversations more structured and thought out, and Shouto has come to look forward to their discussions.\u00a0\nIida\u2019s favourite subject - and one Shouto enjoys talking about too - is school work. Jirou has long dubbed them nerds, but Shouto finds that he doesn\u2019t really care because learning is important and sort of the whole reason why they\u2019re here.\u00a0\nHe enjoys talking about lesson structures and the set content for the term with Iida, enjoys coming up with ways to fit revision into what seems to be their busiest term yet.\nIida and he will talk about what they learnt that day, about how they interpreted certain topics, and what they think the year holds for them.\nIida has also taken to actively encouraging Shouto to disagree with him with - encouraging Shouto to use his own thoughts and feelings and not just side with what they\u2019ve been told. And then, when Shouto does disagree with what Iida puts forward, Iida will engage him in a debate - something the other boy seemingly loves to do.\u00a0\nAt first it put Shouto on edge. Makes him nervous and defensive.\u00a0\nWhen at home, any and all debates would end in harsh training sessions or Shouto being ignored.\nShouto preferred to sit in bitter silences and indulge in acts of rebellion over actively arguing with someone, but Iida isn\u2019t arguing with him at all, not really. He\u2019s encouraging Shouto to voice his opinion, to listen to others and respond in turn, and he smiles at Shouto regardless of his differing opinion.\nIt\u2019s nice. Iida is nice. He\u2019s caring in a less full on way, acts more like a safety net Shouto can entrust to be there for him without either of them ever having to say it aloud.\nThey don't need to talk about the things that still haunt Shouto\u2019s nights and spill over into his days, and it's nice. Iida is haunted too, Shouto knows, and he thinks that his own steady presence might be just as helpful to the taller boy as his is to Shouto.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYaoyorozu and him fall into a similar gym routine this term. Shouto has always preferred to go the gym after classes have finished for the day as opposed to relaxing like the rest of his class mates, and Yaoyorozu has started doing the same thing.\n\u201cI just figured that you must be onto something,\u201d she tells him one day, long hair twisted into a messy bun and the loose strands curling from sweat. \u201cI was reading up on how what time you exercise can affect how well it works, and you\u2019re the most well-trained person I know. The best, really. Especially in our class.\" she shrugs at him as if that isn't a massive compliment. \"So, I thought that there's a good chance\u00a0 I can become better if I try to imitate your routine.\u201d\nShouto blinks at her, not knowing how to respond to her statement and not really knowing if she expects an answer at all. Yaoyorozu seems earnest though, the comment obviously offhanded as she heads over to the weights whilst Shouto is left feeling confused and humbled by her words.\nDespite her claim to imitate his routine, they don\u2019t have the same exercise regime. Shouto likes cardio more than anything, something he thinks is probably related to being shut away in a house for most of his life, whereas Yaoyorozu likes to work of building her core muscles.\u00a0\nSo, although they work out together, they don\u2019t necessarily work out together. The only thing they really have in common is using the treadmill at the same time.\u00a0\nAt first if was weird, but Shouto has grown to appreciate Yaoyorozu's companionable silence whilst running, has found it nice to be able to glance over and see her there with sweat beading on her forehead and face as flushed as his own.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s so different to his father\u2019s snarls and flames, to his mother's whispered apologies from the side lines.\nIt\u2019s better. It makes him feel better.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKirishima will linger in the empty spots of Shouto\u2019s days, somehow plastering himself into all the spaces that Shouto didn\u2019t even realise were there, but never pushing, never seeking more, just chatting about - well. Mostly crap, if Shouto\u2019s honest. Utter and complete crap that is just as frustrating as it is captivating.\nWherever Kirishima goes Ashido seems to be too, both of them creating a whirlwind of noise and smiles and distractions. Hues of pink and red staining his eyes and his cheeks as they gossip about the most obscure things Shouto has ever heard of.\nAnd then the third of their little party, Bakugou.\u00a0\nHe\u2019s not as obscure as the other two are, but he\u2019s still just as loud, just as captivating.\u00a0\nBakugou likes to come across as brash and rude, likes to think himself uncaring and above friendship, and yet the other boy somehow cares in a capacity Shouto had never thought possible. He cares in a way that Shouto has grown to appreciate.\nLoud is good when the silence is too much and Bakugou\u2019s brashness is relieving when Shouto is too polite to tell people to leave him alone. Even his rudeness, his blunt no-nonsense way of caring, is something that Shouto needs when he himself is teetering on the edge of being too mean. It\u2019s something Shouto needs when everything feels too much - when he falls back into the easy bitterness and resentment he grew up within.\nBakugou is invasive in a way Shouto didn\u2019t know could be positive, is one of the only people that isn\u2019t afraid to call Shouto an idiot and push back when he pushes away. The other boy is his own brand of storm, a raging wind beside Shouto\u2019s own high seas.\nTogether - because the three of them do come as a package, most days - Shouto finds that their personalities are oddly complimentary and that he's more than happy to fit himself alongside them, to be surrounded by the storm they create: noise and distraction and no opportunity to think about the dark mass that still linger in the back of his mind.\nIt\u2019s nice.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Then there\u2019s Midoriya.\n(Midoriya, Midoriya, Midoriya.)\nHe's everything at once, loud and chatty and yet silent and calm and just ---\u00a0\nHe\u2019s perfect, really.\nFor Shouto, Midoriya is the perfect mix of everything. The perfect balance between too much and not enough, a gentleness about the other boy that can easily vibrate into something more electric, something that makes Shouto\u2019s heart race and mind whirl but in a good way.\nShouto\u2019s whole life has left him feeling like he\u2019s nothing more than a mass of swirling anger - nothing more than a burning resentment towards his father and the\u00a0 childhood he was forced to have. Before he moved into the dorms, he had manged to convince himself that he could never be anything more than bitterness, could never feel anything more than the anger that ran so deep and felt so raw.\u00a0\nBut he feels so different now. He feels better. He feels happy, maybe.\u00a0\nShouto experiences emotions more deeply and freely than ever before and it\u2019s nice. It\u2019s nice.\u00a0\nShouto\u2019s life is nice, and the role he thought he had to fall into, one at the end of a path that was laid out for him by his father - one which was built out of the world's expectation of Endeavors son - has warped into something he wants to create for himself.\nIt\u2019s a role Midoriya had introduced him to by encouraging the flames and the heat and the brightness of life, because, despite what Shouto had once thought, it was his Quirk. His.\u00a0\nShouto had still been all anger and bitterness at the time, but standing in that arena with Midoriya across from him, the other boy panting and desperate, he had finally seen that his fire was his own and that nobody could truly own his powers besides him.\u00a0\nMidoriya had shown him that, had flayed Shouto apart with nothing but kindness in the middle of that arena, and had then stuck by his side as Shouto slowly learnt to build himself back together.\nMidoriya with his pretty eyes and tanned skin and Shouto-specific-smiles - Shouto-specific everything really, Shouto has grown to notice - had chosen to befriend him, to grow close and continue to encourage Shouto to be himself.\nLately, when Midoriya interacts with him, it\u2019s with something softer than ever before. Something more wholesome and true that leaves Shouto flustered and wanting.\nMidoriya speaks to Shouto with something that is eager, genuine, and unforgivably real.\u00a0\nSome days Shouto can still feel the echoes of his past, can see the crumbling path of his future, the lurking darkness wanting to consume everything, but Shouto feels like he can cope with it now.\u00a0\nSomething that makes it impossibly easier to cope, to move on and look forward, is knowing that he\u2019s got his own support network. He has his own carousel of people that are willing to help, listen, and distract him when he needs it.\nThere are people who like Shouto for Shouto. He has friends who don\u2019t expect anything from him and don\u2019t just like him for who is father is.\nThere is only kindness, genuine and real, and it\u2019s all so --\u00a0\nIt\u2019s like ---\nFamily is the only word Shouto can find to fit it. This is what family must feel like.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you happy, Shouto-kun?\u201d Midoriya asks him. Around them the campus trees have started to turn orange, the green of summer fading into the colour of autumn, and leaves have started to fall from their branches, painting everything in yellow-red hues.\u00a0\nAhead of Midoriya and him are the rest of their class, all of them heading towards the main campus building in time for homeroom.\nThey\u2019d had a big dorm breakfast today, Uraraka and - surprisingly - Bakugou managing to cook them up a hearty meal to prepare them for a day of suspected exams.\u00a0\nAizawa-sensei had told them to expect the unexpected this term and, much to their sensei\u2019s chagrin, All-Might has taken to dropping not-so-subtle hints about when the unexpected might be expected.\nSo, they all suspect that something big is going to happen today due to All Mights winks and emphasised conversations. Well, that and the fact Aizawa glares whenever All Might skirts around giving it all away.\u00a0\nThey know that the arena being off limits for the past week relates to them, and it hasn't been hard to guess that it's something to do with today, especially with the way Aizawas left eye had been twitching as he'd dragged All Might out of class yesterday.\u00a0\nA few years ago, Shouto knows, the thought of something like a surprise exam would\u2019ve filled him with anger and dread. He probably would\u2019ve done anything and everything to show the class that he was the best, the most powerful, and try to prove to them all that he shouldn\u2019t be messed with. That he was strong and capable and could succeed on his own.\nToday Shouto is wearing a scarf Yaoyorozu had bought for him, something soft and tartan patterned that is apparently very complimentary to his hair, and his arm is linked with Midoriya\u2019s as they walk to class.\u00a0\nThey\u2019re lingering behind everyone else and are most likely to be the last two to get to their desks, and Shouto doesn\u2019t feel even a hint of anxiety at that thought. There is no need to prove himself to anyone nor is there any need to seperate himself from his friends.\nThe air smells like a mix of pine and wet grass, the winter sun shining brightly in the sky, and Midoriya\u2019s arm is warm in his, Shouto's elbow pressed firmly against the older boys side. Surprise exam or not, Shouto can say that he feels good about today.\u00a0\n\nAre you happy, Shouto-kun?\n\nShouto looks over at Midoriya who is looking back at him - who is always looking back at him - and he sees the other boy\u2019s curiosity, his face an open book with a Shouto specific smile on his pink lips, soft and warm and lovely. The morning light is bathing his dark curls a deep green and the cold air has left Midoriya\u2019s cheeks and nose dusted red, and whatever answer Shouto chooses, he knows that Midoriya will stay by his side.\u00a0\nCute, Shouto\u2019s heart thuds, watching as dark curls are tugged by the wind. Cute, cute, cute.\nShouto feels so full of warmth, stomach fluttering and his own expression growing soft at the sight of Midoriya (lovely, wonderful Midoriya), at the sound of the laughter ahead of them and the feeling of the sun on his own face.\u00a0\nThey\u2019ve been circling each other for weeks now, Midoriya and him. There\u2019s something to their interactions, something that buzzes and is underlined with an edge of something new. Something exciting. It makes a part of Shouto want,\u00a0and he\u00a0thinks that maybe he has always wanted more, in one form or another.\n\nIs he happy?\n\nShouto has never answered yes\u00a0in fear of it being wrong. He has never responded without doubt because one of Shouto's traits is doubting everything, but right here, right now, Shouto thinks he could answer yes\u00a0and it be the most truthful thing he\u2019s ever said.\nHe has never been so far away from unhappy in his entire life, if he\u2019s being honest with himself. Everything within him feels so alive, so bright and real, and it bubbles within him and bleeds from his pores and leaves him breathless.\nMidoriya is by his side, his arm willingly tangled with Shouto\u2019s own, and Shouto knows that what he's feeling is happiness.\u00a0\nI am, Shouto goes to say. I am, I am - are you?\u00a0\n\"I love you.\u201d is what comes out instead, the sparkling brightness within him spiking and spilling out with the most honest thing he can think to say to this lovely, handsome boy who had been the first person to befriend Shouto. Who had chosen to stick by his side and show him that he could be himself despite the bitterness that had loomed underneath his every action.\nMidoriya blinks at him now, dark eyelashes against tan skin, seemingly startled. Shouto blinks back once, twice, before his brain catches up to his heart.\u00a0\nShouto can feel his face go as red as the leaves around them, all the spiking heat rushing to his face instead crushing his heart. He doesn\u2019t want to take the words back, though. He won\u2019t take them back - refuses to - because it\u2019s true. He does love Midoriya.\nHe loves Midoriya and it doesn\u2019t have to mean anything and yet he loves Midoriya and it probably means everything.\nMidoriya - the boy who helps and supports and gives and gives and gives. Who asks Shouto if he\u2019s okay every single day without fail because he wants to know the answer - because he cares about Shouto\u2019s wellbeing.\nMidoriya, with his strong jawline and his freckled nose, who will smile no matter what answer Shouto gives. Sometimes it\u2019s a sad smile, one that makes Midoriya\u2019s eyes shine with a promise of you will be happy soon, and sometimes it\u2019s a brighter smile, one that could rival the sun, one that silently says I\u2019m happy you\u2019re happy, even though Shouto has never once outrightly admitted it.\nMidoriya\u2019s face splits into that smile now, the sunshine smile that makes Shouto wish he could draw so that he could capture it forever. It\u2019s more than just a smile though, it\u2019s an emotion that Midoriya feels so brightly and deeply that it somehow lights up his entire being and radiates in his eyes and his cheeks and his fingertips.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s -- It\u2019s what Shouto feels when he looks at the other boy. It\u2019s that same emotion, that same -\n\u201cI love you too,\u201d Midoriya says, voice choked and eyes watering and smile still so bright, tears spilling down his wind bitten cheek.\u00a0\nShouto\u2019s eyes widen in alarm at the sight of the other boy crying and he quietly pleads, \u201cdon\u2019t cry,\" as he reaches out to try and hastily wipe at the other boy\u2019s cheeks, hating the sight of tears that are caused by him. \u201cMidoriya- Izuku-san. Don\u2019t cry. Don't. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cChrist,\u201d Izuku bats his hands away with a sniffly laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re something else Shouto.\u201d He grabs onto Shouto\u2019s hands though, smaller fingers slotting through Shouto\u2019s own and squeezing. \u201cDon\u2019t say sorry to me, you idiot.\u201d\u00a0\nShouto frowns at that, half of him feeling alarmed at Midoriya\u2019s reaction - at his tears - and the other half of him marvelling at the feeling of Midoriya holding his hands. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Shouto offers again.\n\u201cIdiot.\u201d Midoriya repeats fondly, \u201cStupid, loveable, idiot,\u201d his expression, despite the tears, is still so wholesome, his smile bright and his face soft and full of love--\u00a0\nOh. Midoriya said he loves him.\u00a0\nOh.\n\nOh.\n\nShouto didn\u2019t think that Midoriya would offer anything in return, really, but this is...\nShouto doesn\u2019t know how to explain whatever this is.\u00a0\nHe didn\u2019t think that the feeling inside of him could grow stronger, but here Shouto is, his arm hairs standing on end and his Quirk stuttering, frost creeping over his fingers and making Midoriya drop his hands in alarm whilst heat pulses within him.\nMidoriya loves him.\nShouto doesn\u2019t realise he\u2019s stopped walking until Midoriya is standing in front of him with a bemused expression. \u201cWhat?\u201d The other boy asks, cocking his head to one side. \u201cYou thought you could spring that on me but didn\u2019t expect anything in return?\u201d\nYes, Shouto doesn\u2019t say.\u00a0\nBecause, despite the words coming from his mouth, despite the fact they were true and that he knew deep down that Midoriya felt the same, a big part of Shouto never actually thought he would hear those words directed at him in return.\nHe feels his face grow warm, eyes dropping shyly as Midoriya lets out a weird cooing laugh. \u201cShouto-kun,\u201d Midoriya says with so much affection that Shouto doesn\u2019t know what to do.\nActually --\u00a0\nMidoriya is almost a head shorter than him, but Shouto has learnt how to curl his shoulders and bend his knees so that he\u2019s able to tuck his head firmly into the other boy\u2019s shoulder. Midoriya makes a quiet mmph at the sudden action, but there\u2019s no delay in the other boy returning the hug. His arms curl around Shouto\u2019s neck and the older boy rises onto his tiptoes so that Shouto doesn\u2019t have to bend so awkwardly, and it feels so natural to hug the other boy like this. To press his face against Midoriya\u2019s skin and breathe him in.\u00a0\nMidoriya smells like laundry detergent and spices mixed with vanilla which - which is probably from his and Uraraka\u2019s new baking experiment. Underneath that, though, is something muskier, something that is uniquely Midoriya. The other boy warm and solid in Shout\u2019s arms and he's holding Shouto back firmly, laughing wetly in his ear when Shouto squeezes his arms even tighter around the other boy\u2019s waist.\nThank you, Shouto almost says before deciding that\u2019s a weird response. \u201cI love you,\u201d Shouto breathes into the other boy\u2019s skin, heart racing but mind content.\n\u201cYou too,\u201d Midoriya says, pulling back with a smile on his face. \u201cI love you too.\u201d\nShouto smiles in return, has maybe been smiling for a while now, and watches as Midoriya\u2019s eyes drop to Shouto\u2019s mouth. There\u2019s a pause then, a moment in which Shouto can feel his face grow impossibly hotter, before his own eyes drop to Midoriya\u2019s lips.\nMidoriya shifts, hands twitching where they\u2019re still around Shouto\u2019s neck, fingers somehow now twisted in the hair at Shouto's nape, and Shouto lets his eyes flutter shut, heart pounding within his chest. He doesn\u2019t know what to do, really, but he trusts Midoriya and he wants this, he\u2019s so happy and ---\nBefore anything can happen, they\u2019re hit from the side by a red blur.\n\u201cThanks for waiting guys,\u201d Kirishima says breathlessly, successfully breaking the tension that had built between them. The other boy clings to them both, dog piling onto the hug with a relieved huff. \u201cI honestly thought you\u2019d all forgotten about me. I can\u2019t believe nobody woke me up!\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d Midoriya blinks at Shouto over Kirishima\u2019s shoulder, eyes scrunching into a familiar smile. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Kiri.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cCome on then,\u201d Kirishima, apparently truly unaware of the moment he's just ruined, loops his own arms through Midoriya\u2019s and Shouto\u2019s and starts dragging them forward. \"We've gotta catch up with everyone else!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cAny idea what today\u2019s about?\u201d Midoriya asks, falling easily into a conversation with the other boy.\nShouto still can\u2019t forget the moment that's just passed though, the echoing I love you making his heart flutter even now, that makes his face hot and mind stutter and-\n\u201cNice smile, loser.\u201d Bakugou comments as they catch up with the rest of them. Shouto blinks, not too sure why Bakugou is looking at him, before he realises that he\u2019s smiling like an idiot.\nBecause Midoriya loves him.\nBecause he has friends.\nBecause he\u2019s happy.\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Shouto says, aiming for deadpan but coming across as something more genuine, and he feels his smile grow when Bakugou\u2019s face falls into his why-do-I-like-these-idiots scowl.\u00a0\u00a0\nMidoriya snorts at the interaction, Uraraka twisting up ahead to give Shouto a smile of her own, and Ashido comes over and jumps onto Shouto\u2019s back, complaining about wasting her precious energy on walking when it\u2019s going to be needed for class.\n\nAre you happy, Shouto-kun?\n\nYeah, he is.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0"
