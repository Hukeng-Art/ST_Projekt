    "summary": "<p>When the King is attacked in his tent on patrol and falls into an unending sleep everyone is worried. What they don't know is that Arthur is fine. In fact he is standing right here next to them, watching them all fret over his prone body. To stave off the boredom whilst a cure is found Arthur takes to wandering the castle and soon discovered a hidden side of Camelot he never knew about. </p>\n<p>Or: Arthur's soul gets trapped outside his body and takes to following his servant around. He gets an interesting insight into Merlin, his servant's life and just how much Camelot needs the man.</p>",
    "notes": "<p>So I never post fics in parts. Mainly because I am worried that if it doesn't get a lot of response I'll get disheartened and never post the rest. And I hate not finishing things. </p>\n<p>Rest assured this is complete but there is quite a lot to this fic so I thought this one was best to *nervously* post it in parts. </p>\n<p>There will be six chapters in all and just under 30K word count. I'm posting chapter one and two together as chapter one is too small on its own. I will re-look over the other chapters and will be looking to post every 3-4 days wifi permitting. If you want the next chapter posting sooner... comment! Let me know. </p>\n<p>Here it goes...</p>\n<p>Thank you so much to everyone who commented :) I was going to post this next part tomorrow but I got it all checked and edited so I thought I would get it out early to you all!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_3_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Still a few more parts to edit and post so let me know that you are all still enjoying it. I will hopefully be able to get the next part up before the weekend (but comments make me edit faster) ;)</p>\n<p>Thank you to everyone that has commented so far :) <br>Here Merlin has another run in with Lord Bodin, Arthur and Merlin go to see the Druids and figure out what has happened to Arthur.</p>\n<p>Thanks for those that continue to comment :)<br>So Arthur has now seen that Merlin is smart, that his Knights listen to him, that he can strategise and plan, that he puts all before Camelot... How about Arthur witnessing some BAMF!Merlin?</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_5_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Only one planned part left :D <br>As always it is pretty much finished but I am not completely happy with the ending just yet so if you have any suggestions for what you want to see happen or anything like that feel free to send them over! Something might bash the last few paragraphs into shape.</p>\n<p>First of all - thank you to everyone who has commented. I am not able to respond to them all individually but know that I really appreciate them and they have helped me push through this final chapter.<br>Secondly - I am so sorry for the wait.

    "text": "The last thing that Arthur clearly remembers is Merlin\u2019s sulking face in his tent. \nOK, perhaps \u2018sulking\u2019 is too strong a word, considering the boy had likely been awake since before dawn. But there was really only so much moping that Arthur could handle. \n\u201cWhat is wrong with you Merlin?\u201d Arthur had barked when Merlin fumbled with his armour once again, letting a vambrace drop to the floor. \n\u201cNothing,\u201d his servant had said with a shrug. \u201cJust tired.\u201d\n\u201cWell go to bed and get untired. We\u2019ve got another five days on this patrol and I don\u2019t want to have to spend it with you moping.\u201d\nMerlin had shot him a slightly wounded look and gone to his own bedroll outside beside the fire. Arthur had sighed loudly, lamenting his lot in life that he had to deal with such a sullen manservant, and gone to bed himself. \nThe next thing he knew was pain. Pain like nothing he had ever felt before. Like his heart was being ripped from his chest. Then a blinding light. Then nothing. \n-\nWhen Arthur\u2019s senses finally return he feels as if he is in a dream. His being feels light, like it could float away any moment. Testing each of his limbs in turn Arthur determines he isn\u2019t gravely injured, he doesn\u2019t feel any immediate pain but the ghost memory of that lancing agony in his chest has him move very gingerly. \nWhen he finally opens his eyes the most peculiar sight assaults him, and he is sure he is dreaming. \nHe is laid on the floor of what looks to be his chambers, though he cannot say he has ever seen it quite from this angle. His vision is taken up with the legs and boots of various people and when he cranes his head upwards he sees the familiar figures of Gaius, Leon and Elyan with his arm in a sling, all gathered at the side of his bed. \nArthur groans, pushing himself slowly to sitting. No one even glances down at him. \n\u201cOh, don\u2019t mind me,\u201d he grumbles, getting his feet beneath him. \u201cI\u2019m only the King of this god forsaken kingdom.\u201d\nThe change in height makes a strange ringing chime through his head and Arthur leans heavily against the bedpost, shaking his head to clear it. He still feels very strange. He must have been taken gravely ill on patrol for him to have been brought back to his chambers with no recollection of the journey. \n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asks groggily, mainly aimed at Gaius as the old man always seems to be the voice of reason in any room. \nAgain, silence is all the response he gets. \nThen, when Arthur\u2019s ears have finally stopped ringing, he glances down at the bed to see what the hell has caught everyone\u2019s attention so raptly they ignore their sovereign\u2026 Only to be faced with the sight of himself, King Arthur, laid resplendent on the bed before him. \n-\nArthur\u2019s first reaction to seeing himself laid unconscious on the bed in front of him is not his proudest moment (he lets out a startled yelp, a little too high in octave for his own personal preference and stumbles backwards falling back down onto the floor again).\nHis second reaction (once he had got back up) is to shout. Loudly. It does not take him very long to realise that no one can hear him. He then starts frantically waving his arms around in a manner more akin to a chicken than a King of the Realm. He isn\u2019t sure whether he is happy or not that no one seems to be able to see him either. \n\u201cHow did this happen?\u201d Guinevere asks once Gaius has finished his inspection. She is asking Gaius, but her eyes are flicking between Gaius and Merlin who is hovering at the edges of the room. \n\u201cI don\u2019t know Gwen,\u201d Arthur\u2019s servant responds, guilt dripping from each word. \u201cI was asleep. The first thing I knew about it was the Knights yelling. When I woke up Elyan had already been hit, the attackers had gone and then\u2026\u201d he gestures down at Arthur\u2019s prone body. \n\u201cI heard chanting from the tent and went to investigate,\u201d Elyan explains. \u201cThey were dressed plainly in black, no armour. One of the men had a crystal over the King. As soon as they saw me they ran.\u201d\n\u201cWe were unable to catch them in the dark Your Highness,\u201d Leon continues, addressing Guinevere. \u201cOnce we realised the King would not wake and Elyan was injured we made haste for Camelot.\u201d\n\u201cI am unsure what the issue is Gwen,\u201d Gaius says solemnly, still looking down at Arthur\u2019s body with a frown. \u201cIt appears as if the King is sleeping yet he will not wake.\u201d\n\u201cGaius you have to fix this!\u201d Arthur curses at the physician. Gaius doesn\u2019t even blink. With a growl of frustration Arthur swings his arm at the nearby vase. His hand simply sails through it. With his lack of an outlet for his deafening anger Arthur actually roars. Conversation carries on around him. \n\u201cI don\u2019t think it wise that we make the king\u2019s condition public knowledge your majesty,\u201d Gaius is saying in the background. \n\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d Merlin mumbles, taking a step forward. \u201cIt is still too soon after Morgana\u2019s reign and your wedding.\u201d\nLeon nods. \u201cThe Lords are still wary after Morgana. Arthur had only just started to gain their confidence back. Finding out that he is asleep and we don\u2019t know how to wake him could be just the thing a Lord needs to make an attempt on the throne.\u201d\n\u201cOr Morgana,\u201d Merlin mutters ominously. The room quietens then, considering the implications of this whole situation and Arthur cannot find fault in what any of them are saying. \n\u201cWell if you think that is best then that is what we shall do,\u201d Guinevere says, a slight quiver of unease in her voice. \nArthur steps forward towards his wife, to offer his comfort, but Merlin just walks right through his body and reaches Guinevere\u2019s side before Arthur can even recover. Guinevere sinks into the servant\u2019s embrace easily. \n\u201cWhat will we tell court about Arthur?\u201d Elyan asks the room. \u201cThey will have seen him brought back injured.\u201d\n\u201cMerely assigned bedrest by the court physician,\u201d Gaius says. \u201cIt is a leg wound. Too much movement in healing can elongate the process.\u201d\n\u201cI will talk to the Lords,\u201d Merlin offers. \u201cLet them know that you are not to be disturbed.\u201d\nThe group disperses from the bedside, talking quietly amongst themselves and Arthur is drawn to his own body like a moth to the flame. It is a strange experience, he thinks, looking down at his own sleeping face. In fact, this is the first time he has ever looked at himself with his eyes shut. \nAs Arthur always does in moments of great stress or upheaval he takes a minute to take stock of the situation.\nHis body is here in the bed, sleeping. \nBut Arthur is here, standing next to his bed, looking down at his closed eyelids. \nNo one can hear him. No one can see him. He cannot touch anything. He cannot feel anything. It is almost like he does not exist. Yet clearly, he does. \nArthur looks down at his body once more and heaves a great sigh. \nArthur thinks that it says something about his life that this is not the strangest thing that has ever happened to him.\nThe early morning sun is peaking between the heavy curtains of the royal chambers the next time Arthur hears the creak of the opening door. It is so quiet that it would not have woken him if he had been able to sleep at all, but apparently another torment of this ghost presence he seems to be stuck in is an inability to sleep at all. It doesn\u2019t wake Guinevere who had fallen asleep late into the night propped in the chair beside his bed. \nArthur looks away from his sleeping wife to the opening door and is not surprised to see Merlin edging silently into the space. His servant\u2019s eyes go straight through Arthur to the body laid on the bed, something heavy and burdened in his eyes for just a second. \nIt is gone quickly as Merlin\u2019s gaze settles onto the sleeping Gwen and softens. The servant sighs and shakes his head in fond exasperation as he settles the tray of food on the dining table. He steps through the room silently, his feet sure and steady against the old timber floor treads. \n\u201cYou are never this quiet when coming to wake me in the morning,\u201d Arthur grouses, crossing his arms over his chest. \n\u201cGwen,\u201d Merlin whispers softly when he reaches her sleeping form. \u201cGwen,\u201d he repeats, crouching down at her side. She snuffles daintily in her sleep fighting against the wakefulness Arthur can see permeating through her body. \n\u201cYou\u2019d better wake up. The Cook is calling for you,\u201d Merlin says with a teasing lilt to his voice. \u201cShe\u2019s very angry. You\u2019re late to serve breakfast. Quick Gwen!\u201d\n\u201cThat is a terrible trick,\u201d Gwen grumbles tiredly as her eyes peek open. Arthur watches her look down on the grinning Merlin and her face opens with a smile. \n\u201cSorry,\u201d Merlin chuckles, sounding not sorry in the slightest. \nGwen seems to agree with Arthur as she swats at Merlin\u2019s arm with a lazy hand. He playfully dodges away and finally comes to Arthur\u2019s bedside. \n\u201cNice to have your attention at last Merlin,\u201d Arthur huffs watching Merlin watch his body as he stands to the side. It is a disconcerting notion. \n\u201cAnd good morning to you too My Lord,\u201d Merlin says warmly as he starts inspecting beneath Arthur\u2019s eyelids. \nArthur\u2019s heart leaps into his mouth. \u201cMerlin,\u201d he starts breathlessly. \u201cDid you hear me?\u201d\nBut Merlin ignores him in favour of prodding at his body\u2019s neck with two fingers. \n\u201cIs there no change?\u201d Gwen asks. \n\u201cNo, not since last night.\u201d\nGwen seems to deflate into her chair at that. \u201cI just wish he would wake.\u201d\n\u201cHe will soon enough,\u201d Merlin says with a smile. \u201cJust as soon as we figure out what caused his slumber.\u201d\n\u201cHe just looks so\u2026. He is so still,\u201d Gwen says leaning forward in her chair. \u201cIn the night I dreamed that he was just sleeping and that he would wake with a snore in the morning and demand his breakfast.\u201d\n\u201cKeep your voice down or he might hear and do just that!\u201d Merlin says with laughter in his voice. \u201cBut I only brought one breakfast and it is for you. Come and eat.\u201d\nMerlin chuckles along with Gwen and Arthur smiles sadly, watching the two old friends in the morning light. Merlin steps away from the bed then gesturing for Gwen to follow. When her only movement is to grab Arthur\u2019s hand Merlin stills and comes back over to his friend. \n\u201cHow can you be so sure he is alright?\u201d Gwen whispers quietly.\n\u201cBecause his body is truly sleeping,\u201d Merlin explains. \u201cLook.\u201d With an expert hand Merlin gently peels back the eyelid of Arthur\u2019s body. \u201cHis eyes react to light.\u201d He presses his ear to Arthur\u2019s chest. \u201cHis heart beats strong. How does his hand feel?\u201d\nGwen runs her fingers over Arthur\u2019s lax ones. \u201cWarm.\u201d\n\u201cSo his blood runs well. His body is strong and alive and safe. He will wake and when he does he will have my head if you are not in the same way so please, come eat your breakfast?\u201d\nWith a huff and smile Guinevere stands then, letting Arthur\u2019s hand slip through her grasp. Although Arthur had not been able to feel her touch he feels almost bereft now that it is gone and he is stood alone by his prone body. \nGuinevere and Merlin are chatting amicably over at the breakfast table but Arthur can\u2019t seem to tear his eyes away from the image of himself laid out, seemingly asleep. So many times in the night he had tried to tie himself back to his body. He had shouted, he had screamed, he had tried jumping into the corpse before him. Nothing had worked. \nFrustration is bubbling up inside him again and he longs for the reassuring depth of his own compact body to be able to pick something up and throw it. Preferably at Merlin\u2019s head. \nA knock at the chamber door derails his fancy and all three beings in the room turn to look at the closed door. \nGwen looks back at Merlin with wide eyes. \n\u201cI thought you gave the court instructions not to disturb us?\u201d Arthur asks brusquely. Really Merlin had one job to do. \n\u201cDon\u2019t worry I\u2019ll get rid of them,\u201d Merlin mumbles unhappily.\n Arthur walks over to Merlin\u2019s side so he is easily able to get a good view of the early morning visitor when Merlin opens it a fraction. \n\u201cLord Bodin,\u201d Merlin greets the greying man in Arthur\u2019s doorway. \nArthur thanks his invisible appearance for the first time as he is able to let out the very heartfelt groan he normally has to curtail when this particular Lord comes knocking. It always seems to be at whatever hour of the day Lord Bodin chooses. As if his life\u2019s mission is to keep Arthur in a perpetual state of uneasiness. \n\u201cHow can I help you at this hour of the morning?\u201d The smile Merlin offers the early morning visitor is so bland and wooden that Arthur snorts. \nThe Lord sniffs, holding his nose in the air. \u201cI wish to speak with the King.\u201d\n\u201cThe King is on bed rest, as you know,\u201d Merlin explains slowly. \u201cAnd the queen is still preparing for the day. Shall I pass on a message?\u201d\n\u201cWhen will the Queen be fit for a visitor?\u201d\n\u201cThe Queen has a very busy morning planned I am afraid. She will be taking court this afternoon should you have a matter you want to discuss.\u201d\n\u201cDo you think I would be here if it could wait until court boy?\u201d the Lord snaps. \nArthur bristles at the Lord\u2019s tone but Merlin simply stares back at the old man with a bland mask. \n\u201cDon\u2019t let him in Merlin,\u201d Arthur hisses giving the Lord his most contemptuous glare. \n\u201cReally Lord Bodin,\u201d Merlin says. \u201cI am happy to pass on any missives or messages you may have.\u201d\n\u201cIt is an urgent matter,\u201d Lord Bodin huffs, looking down his misshapen nose at Merlin. \u201cOne that I do not wish to discuss with a servant.\u201d\n\u201cVery well then. The Queen will see you at council.\u201d\nAnd with that Merlin shuts the door in the Lord\u2019s face. Arthur lets out a crow of laughter, clapping his hands in glee. \u201cYes Merlin. You don\u2019t know how many times I have wished I could do that.\u201d\nMerlin turns back to the table and see\u2019s Gwen watching him with a pointed look. \n\u201cWhat?\u201d he asks innocently. \n\u201cYou know very well what,\u201d Gwen says sternly but Arthur can see the twinkle of amusement in her eyes. \u201cHe is going to punish me for that in chambers later.\u201d\n\u201cHe was going to be difficult anyway. Now I have given him a reason to be difficult and mutual ground for you to complain about me at length. Arthur does it all the time.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s right I do,\u201d Arthur points out. \u201cIt is a very successful distraction technique.\u201d\n\u201cSo Arthur lets you be rude to the Lords he doesn\u2019t like because he cannot be?\u201d Gwen asks. \u201cAnd then uses their dislike of you as a talking point. To distract them from what they really wanted to complain about?\u201d\n\u201cExactly!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll never understand you two,\u201d she chuckles with a shake of her head. \nThe mood in the room darkens as Gwen and Merlin\u2019s chuckles peter out. Arthur can see Gwen\u2019s worried gaze darting back to the bed and his prone form. \n\u201cPaperwork!\u201d Merlin crows drawing both Gwen and Arthur\u2019s gaze back to him. He shuffles off to the desk coming back with a thick stack of missives and correspondence. \u201cArthur normally goes through these at breakfast so he has time to think about what he wants to say at council.\u201d\n\u201cAll of them?\u201d Gwen asks weakly eyeing the thick stack of paper. \n\u201cWell\u2026 no,\u201d Merlin responds. \u201cI read them all and prioritise them for him. What is going to definitely be brought up at council and what needs immediate attention first and then all the other stuff last. All the things that are not that important you can delegate to your Lords in chambers. Here, start with this one.\u201d \nMerlin holds out a piece of paper. \u201cAn invite from Queen Annis?\u201d Gwen asks sceptically. \nMerlin nods already reading through the rest of the papers. \u201cYes, the council will want you to go. To foster good relations or some other such rubbish. So you should decide if you want to go now. If you don\u2019t then you have to come up with some pompous sounding reason why you can\u2019t.\u201d\nArthur scoffs. \u201cThe reasons that I cannot attend every invitation, Merlin, are not pompous. I am a very busy man with a kingdom to run.\u201d\nThey both ignore him and go back to their reading, Merlin scanning the pages quickly and tucking papers to the back of the pile for perusal later. \n\u201cThis is one that will need your attention,\u201d Merlin says with a frown as he eyes scan the in his hands paper back and forth quickly. \u201cIt seems as if Lord Ulcan is up to his old tricks again.\u201d\nHe hands the paper to Gwen to reads over the message carefully. Glancing over her shoulder Arthur manages to get a gist of the message and growls. \n\u201cThat man is a miser!\u201d he calls into the ether. Naturally no one responds. Arthur shakes his head. \u201cJust send Leon. Let him deal with the idiot.\u201d\n\u201cWhat should I do?\u201d Gwen asks, looking at Merlin. \n\u201cWell you are the queen,\u201d Merlin explains. \u201cYou can do as you wish but if Arthur were here he would likely send Leon.\u201d\nArthur blinks in shock but recovers quickly. \u201cSo you\u2019re not as much of an idiot as you pretend to be Merlin!\u201d\n\u201cLeon?\u201d Gwen asks. \n\u201cLeon\u2019s father and Lord Ulcan served together for some time. Leon spent some years at his keep. If anyone is to be able to get him to see reason it would be Leon. Plus Arthur can\u2019t stand the man. Calls him a miser.\u201d\nGwen nods. \u201cThen I will do that then. Should I send a servant with a message or\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo need for that,\u201d Merlin responds breezily leaving the organised papers in two piles in front of Gwen. \u201cI need to pop down to the training grounds anyway to check over Elyan\u2019s shoulder. I can pass on your message.\u201d\n\u201cThank you Merlin. Really I don\u2019t know what we would do without you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you would survive,\u201d he says pressing a farewell kiss into the top of her head. \u201cGaius will be up later today to check on our patient. Did you want me to send anyone up to keep you company?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Gwen sighs looking down at the papers before her. \u201cNo I had better get myself ready and read this.\u201d\nIt takes a moment for Arthur to realise that Merlin is leaving. Arthur looks from Gwen back to the retreating form of Merlin and back again. As much as he loves his wife he thinks he might just go crazy if he were shut up in his room for another day. \n\u201cSorry my love,\u201d he calls over to Gwen who has her head bent over her papers oblivious. \u201cI\u2019ll be back later!\u201d \nArthur manages to squeeze out of the door after Merlin before it falls close with a definitive thud. \nAs soon as the door has closed behind them some of the bravado that Merlin had put up for Gwen\u2019s sake diminishes and he sags briefly back against the closed chamber door. \n\u201cI knew you were worried about me really,\u201d Arthur says smugly though it dissolves quickly when Merlin sighs and pinches the bridge of his nose. Out of the bright sunlight royal chambers his servant looks paler than Arthur\u2019s lifeless body back in the room. The bags under his eyes tell of a night spent not sleeping. And a night most likely spent pouring over books in Gaius\u2019 chambers looking for a cure for their King. \n\u201cGaius will find a cure,\u201d Arthur says in reassurance. \u201cHe always does. And I will be back annoying you soon enough. In the meantime don\u2019t you have chores to do?\u201d\nWith a deep sigh Merlin opens his eyes and pushes purposefully away from the door and down the long corridor away from the royal chambers. With little else to occupy his day Arthur takes one look back at the closed door and follows. \n-\nThe sound of metal on metal is reverberating from the armoury as Merlin and Arthur approach. Merlin pushes open the door without ceremony and the two young boys inside pause in fright. \n\u201cThomas. Grethin,\u201d Merlin greets them kindly. They relax as soon as the recognise Merlin and lower the practice swords they had been swinging to their sides. \u201cWhat are you two playing at?\u201d\n\u201cNot playing,\u201d Thomas says with a sniff. \u201cPracticing.\u201d\n\u201cFor what?\u201d Merlin asks. \u201cIs there a high call for a swordsman in the stables?\u201d\nThomas colours and dips his head to hide his blush. \n\u201cYou don\u2019t got to be high born to be a knight no more,\u201d Grethin says sullenly. \u201cI could do it if I wanted to.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a point Merlin,\u201d Arthur says just to be contrary and folds his arms against his chest. \nMerlin chuckles as he inspects Arthur\u2019s collection of weaponry. \u201cPerhaps not. But you do need a sense of duty. Tell me Grethin; where does your duty call for you to be this morning?\u201d\nThe boy hangs his head and mumbles something that Arthur doesn\u2019t quite catch. \n\u201cI thought as much,\u201d Merlin says shrewdly. \u201cSo you had better get back to the bakery before your father has to serve the entire citadel on his own.\u201d\n Grethin throws an angry look at Merlin and all but throws the practice sword at Thomas before he storms out. Thomas catches it cleanly with his spare hand and Arthur raises an impressed eyebrow. \n\u201cNice catch,\u201d Arthur and Merlin say at the same time. Thomas grins shyly at the praise and quickly places the swords back where he found them. \n\u201cShirking their duty is something I expect from Grethin, but you Thomas? I know for a fact that Master Lewin needs your hand in the stables this morning.\u201d\nThomas shrugs but toes at the ground in guilt. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a stable boy.\u201d\n\u201cEven a knight of Camelot will often have to do things that they may not look forward to or enjoy,\u201c Merlin says patiently. \u201cWatch as an example\u2026\u201d\nRight on cue Leon wanders into the armoury. \nThomas literally jumps where he stands coming to a stand tall and to attention. \u201cMorning Sir Leon,\u201d he calls politely.\nLeon gifts him a warm smile. \u201cAh morning Thomas. Merlin.\u201d\n\u201cMorning Leon,\u201d Merlin greets with a smile. \n\u201cAre you coming to watch training?\u201d\n\u201cI came to see you,\u201d Merlin says as Leon passes. \u201cThe queen wanted me to ask you if you would consider making a trip to speak to Lord Ulcan.\u201d\nIt is only because Arthur knows Leon so well that he notices the grimace in his knight\u2019s face and battens down a snigger. \n\u201cIs he being\u2026 difficult again?\u201d Leon asks. \n\u201cHe is forcing passing tradesman to pay a levy to cross the bridge even though Camelot already pay him for the allowance. Arthur and the council have spoken to him on multiple occasion\u2019s but-\u201c\n\u201cYou think I will have better luck with him as my father served under him.\u201d \nArthur smiles proudly at his first knight knowing that the man has already decided to go.\n\u201cThank you Leon,\u201d he murmurs, knowing his knight\u2019s dislike of the old Lord. Merlin seems to catch the agreement too as his shoulders sag on his exhale. \n\u201cThank you Leon,\u201d he echoes. \nLeon opens his mouth to say more but his eyes catch on young Thomas still lingering in the corner. Merlin notices the knight\u2019s reticence too and he claps a friendly hand to Leon\u2019s arm. \n\u201cCome, I will walk with you to the training ground.\u201d\nMerlin steers Leon from the armoury with a pointed stare back at the young boy who quickly scrambles out the other door, back to the stables Arthur assumes. \nArthur turns his head up to the sun, now shining down warmly onto the grounds surrounding the castle. He lets the memory of its warmth seep into him alongside the companionship of his two oldest friends. \nAs his people bustle around him, busy with their days already, Arthur feels a sudden sense of peace with his invisibility for a moment. It has been a long time since he could walk anonymously among his people and simply be. \n\u201cHow is the King?\u201d Leon\u2019s voice pulls Arthur from his musing. \n\u201cSame as yesterday. In perfect health but we just can\u2019t wake him.\u201d\nLeon takes that information for a moment before clapping Merlin on the shoulder. \u201cGaius will find a cure. He always does.\u201d\nMerlin offers Leon a tight smile as they emerge onto the training ground. Arthur takes a moment to look around and watch his knights training and laughing without the knowledge that he is watching. It pleases him that most of the knights don\u2019t seem like they are acting any differently than if Arthur were there in their midst. But when they notice Leon marching to the field they straighten to attention. \nLeon waits for a moment until he is sure he has every man\u2019s attention before he shouts to the crowd. \u201cKing Arthur is still resting.\u201d Arthur tries not to be put out by the chorus of whoops that follow that statement, led by Sir Gwaine of course. Leon quells the noise with a look. \u201cThis does not mean a morning off duty,\u201d he informs the knights sternly. \u201cWe will train hard and show our King just why he picked us to protect Camelot.\u201d \nThat is met with a uniform shout of agreement from the knights who all draw off to their various disciplines to begin training. The last to peel off are his closest knights who all share a murmured word of instruction with Leon. \n\u201cElyan,\u201d Merlin calls as the man starts to make his way over to the archery practice station. The knight looks over his shoulder and literally slumps when Merlin beckons him forward with a crooked finger and raised eyebrow. \n\u201cYou know I need to look at that shoulder.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine Merlin. I promise,\u201d Elyan says, flexing the unbandaged shoulder in evidence. \n\u201cWho is the trained physician here, me or you?\u201d\nAt another raised eyebrow, scarily close to the one Gaius had tormented a young Arthur with, Elyan relents, coming to sit on the bench as Merlin gestures. With sure hands Merlin prods at the shoulder joint and carefully manipulates the arm back and forth within the joint, all with a frown of concentration on his face. \n\u201cYou almost look like you know what you are doing there Merlin,\u201d Arthur teases from the side lines. \n\u201cSo what\u2019s the verdict?\u201d Elyan asks when Merlin lets go of his arm. \u201cWill I live?\u201d\nMerlin gives the Knight an unimpressed look. \u201cTake it easy,\u201d he instructs. \u201cAnd I mean easy. Nothing heavy. But it will be best if you keep it mobile. You come see Gaius the moment anything feels wrong.\u201d\n\u201cYes Sire,\u201d Elyan says in jest, throwing in a mock bow as he leaves making Arthur laugh. Merlin simply rolls his eyes but smiles all the same. He stands from the bench and looks over the training ground for a moment, in much the same way Arthur had done just a moment ago. No one pays the servant of the King much mind as they continue their morning training. \nAfter a few moments Merlin\u2019s eyes catch on something in the far corner of the training field. Following his eyesight Arthur looks over too and see\u2019s the towering presence of one of his newest knights; Sir Kay. \nThe tall man is whooping in delight and hefting one of the large wooden training staffs over his head in celebration. Down at his feet is Sir Percival struggling to his feet. Sir Kay doesn\u2019t even seem to notice. Merlin\u2019s eyes narrow. \n\u201cYou\u2019ve noticed him too?\u201d Arthur murmurs coming to stand shoulder to shoulder with Merlin as they watch the new knight parade. \u201cI have my doubts about him but he comes from a prominent household and his brother was one of my best knights. I am sure with time and training he will be a fine knight.\u201d\nArthur and Merlin watch side by side as Percival finally manages to get to his feet and Sir Kay begins a dramatic re-enactment of how Percival fell to the ground. \n\u201cSo you\u2019ve seen our new prat in training?\u201d Gwaine\u2019s voice materialises on Merlin\u2019s other side. Merlin spares him a sideways glance, keeping his assessing gaze on Sir Kay. \n\u201cHe seems\u2026 boisterous.\u201d\nGwaine snorts. \u201cHe swans around like he\u2019s the Gods gift to the knighthood.\u201d \n\u201cHe comes from a high family,\u201d Merlin says with a shrug. \u201cAnd Arthur was close with his brother Rhegard. The least he can do is give him a trial.\u201d\nLeon looks over at them then, eyes on Gwaine, and makes a series of complicated and frustrated hand gestures. Gwaine signs dramatically. \n\u201cI had better get over there before Leon has a fit.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d better get to work myself.\u201d\n\u201cAre you not watching us train?\u201d\nMerlin harrumphs in laughter even as he walks away, back to the castle. \u201cNot all of us get a day off just because Arthur is lazing in bed!\u201d\n-\nArthur had almost scoffed at that comment but as it nears the midday meal Arthur is worn out just from following Merlin around. \nThey drop clothes off at the laundry, go to the market, the blacksmith, the cobblers, visit three of Gaius\u2019s patients, drop in at the royal kennels (where Merlin panders over the young pups, feeds them cubes of bread and Arthur shouts at Merlin that he is ruining Arthur\u2019s prize hunting hounds), check on the horses and manage to catch the end of the Knight\u2019s training where Merlin checks on Elyan\u2019s shoulder again. Eventually Merlin makes his way up the steep staircase to Gaius\u2019 chambers, Arthur trudging along a few steps behind. \nGaius is sat at his table eating a bowl of soup and reading from a large tome. He looks up as Merlin enters and offers the boy a small smile. \n\u201cYou look tired,\u201d Gaius says in greeting. \n\u201cBusy morning,\u201d Merlin sighs, sinking onto the bench across from Gaius. \u201cAnything?\u201d\n\u201cNot yet. I fear a trip to the library may be needed.\u201d\nMerlin groans but nods. \u201cI\u2019ll go later today. Gwen needs lunch and then she has council. I can go after.\u201d\nFor a moment Gaius just watches Merlin whilst Merlin stares at something in the distance. His eyes flicker back and forth and Arthur can see he is thinking about something furiously. \n\u201cCareful Merlin. You\u2019ll strain something with all that thinking,\u201d Arthur teases. \nMerlin takes a deep breath and shakes his head. \u201cI should have been there.\u201d\nArthur rolls his eyes. \u201cAnd done what exactly?\u201d he says in exasperation. \n\u201cYou cannot blame yourself for this,\u201d Gaius says calmly. \u201cYou cannot keep an eye on Arthur every moment of the day.\u201d\n\u201cBut if I hadn\u2019t been distracted I would have at least seen what happened instead of having to rely on sketchy reports from Knights who have no idea what they were witnessing. So we have to trawl through every book in Camelot looking for any reference to crystals or sleeping and just hope that we figure it out!\u201d\nBy the end of the tirade Merlin is standing and pacing back and forth. \n\u201cYou always do this,\u201d Arthur growls in annoyance. \u201cThis isn\u2019t your job. You clean my chambers and sort my clothes. Leave healing me to the court physician and leave protecting me to the knights!\u201d\n\u201cDistracted by sleeping?\u201d Gaius asked archly. \u201cEven you need to sleep Merlin. You will run yourself into the ground the rate you have been going since the Royal Wedding.\u201d \n\u201cI think you might be exaggerating a bit there Gaius,\u201d Arthur buts in. Because yes, while Merlin has been very busy so is everyone else. And, yes OK that morning that Arthur had just witnessed was quite packed but it was just one morning. \nMerlin doesn\u2019t respond and doesn\u2019t retake his seat. If Arthur had been corporeal he would have grabbed the man\u2019s arm and yanked him into sitting. Gaius seems to know well enough not to push as he goes back to his lunch. \n\u201cI\u2019ve got to go,\u201d Merlin suddenly announces to the room, already turning toward the door. \nBoth Arthur and Gaius start, the latter staring back and forth between a retreating Merlin and his untouched food. \u201cYou haven\u2019t even eaten Merlin!\u201d\n\u201cGwen will be waiting. I\u2019ll see you later. Let me know if you find anything!\u201d\nBefore Gaius can respond Merlin whips from the room and Arthur has to break into a jog to catch up with him before the door closes. \n-\nMerlin spills through the door to Arthur\u2019s chambers at a rush with a carefully balanced plate of food in one hand. \n\u201cSorry, sorry,\u201d he mumbles hurrying forward to where Guinevere is already sat at the table. \u201cGot stuck with Gaius for a bit.\u201d\nArthur see\u2019s Guinevere\u2019s face light up and she looks at Merlin hopefully. \u201cHas he made progress?\u201d\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d Merlin says with a shake of his head as he places the meal before the Queen. \u201cBut he still has some things to look into so don\u2019t worry about that.\u201d\nGwen sighs and slumps in her chair. \u201cI just feel so useless. I wish there were something I could do.\u201d\n\u201cThere are many things you can do for him. One of those is making sure his kingdom doesn\u2019t fall into disrepair while he takes his nap. So eat your meal then you can let your maid get you ready for council.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll come with me?\u201d Gwen asks, looking up at the servant with wide eyes. \nMerlin smiles down on Guinevere, his eyes kind and warm. \u201cOf course.\u201d\nArthur watches as Guinevere daintily eats her meal with one eye on Merlin who has retreated to Arthur\u2019s desk. The curtains around Arthur\u2019s bed have been drawn, likely to shield his sleeping body from any surprise guests. \nMerlin busies himself reading and organising papers on Arthur\u2019s desk. Arthur doesn\u2019t really pay him much mind, leaving Merlin in charge of organising his papers was a task Arthur gave up quite willingly and unconsciously. But a servant who can read is an oddity, Arthur feels no compunction against taking advantage of the one decent skill Merlin possesses. \nMerlin has collected a pile of papers together, most likely the records required for the council session, but on his way back to the table he stumbles and trips on something, probably his own feet, sending the papers scattering to the floor. He curses lightly and sets about picking up his own mess, all the while Arthur watches Guinevere eyeing him shrewdly. \nAfter a while Guinevere takes a long and forced sigh, pushing back from the dining table. \n\u201cI really can\u2019t eat another bite,\u201d she says with a large huff. Arthur narrows his eyes at his wife. \n\u201cCome on Gwen,\u201d Merlin chides as he comes over to inspect her plate, juggling scrolls and papers in his arms. \u201cYou\u2019ve hardly touched it. I can\u2019t take it back to Cook like this.\u201d\n\u201cYou have some,\u201d Guinevere responds quickly, pushing her plate over to Merlin. \u201cPlease. You haven\u2019t eaten yet today have you.\u201d\n\u201cNo. he hasn\u2019t,\u201d Arthur says in realisation. To be honest he had been a little bit preoccupied with his whole \u2018out of body situation\u2019 to notice his servant\u2019s eating habits. \nMerlin huffs affronted and gives Gwen a soft glare. \u201cI\u2019ve been rather busy.\u201d\n\u201cPlease?\u201d Gwen says, undeterred. \u201cArthur would kill me if he woke up from his nap and I have let his servant fall into a state of disrepair.\u201d\nMerlin smiles warmly at her even while he rolls his eyes. He snatches up a sausage and bites it in half. \u201cThere. Happy?\u201d \nBut Guinevere isn\u2019t. Arthur watches on in amusement as the Queen wheedles and cajoles Merlin into eating bits of her food between his chores. By the time Merlin is finished the plate is almost empty and Guinevere looks far too pleased with herself. \n-\nThe council session goes as well as can be expected. Arthur is pleased to note that Guinevere is a lot more prepared than the Lord\u2019s had expected and fends off their enquiries about Arthur\u2019s wellbeing admirably. \nAs they come to the closing of the meeting the Queen asks if any Lords have anything further they wish to discuss. This is simply a formality as the Lords will have submitted a proposal to the King and Queen before the council session for discussion. So it is highly understandable that Guinevere blinks in shock when Lord Bodin rises from the table. \nArthur, who has become accustomed to the Lord\u2019s surprises, gives into the concurrent urge he has around the man to roll his eyes. \n\u201cI apologise for ambushing you with this in front of the council your majesty but I did try to speak with you earlier today.\u201d\n\u201cBlame it on Merlin. Blame it on Merlin,\u201d Arthur hisses into his wife\u2019s ear. But his wife, sweet as she is, simply straightens in her chair and offers the Lord a tight smile. \n\u201cWell we are speaking now Lord Bodin,\u201d Guinevere says with a smile. \u201cWhat do you have to bring before the council?\u201d\nLord Bodin straightens his shoulders and turns to address the table. \u201cThe scourge of sorcery has attacked the kingdom again. This time at its very heart by attacking the King on his patrol. We have become too weak in dealing with these\u2026 creatures. It is time for our methods to be as harsh as theirs.\u201d\nThe table is silent for a moment as each Lord looks to another for guidance on how to respond. Even Arthur is momentarily flummoxed. Yes sorcery is illegal but they already execute magic users. What more did the man want? \n\u201cWe already execute all magic users,\u201d Gaius speaks from his place at the table. \u201cWhat else are you suggesting Lord Bodin?\u201d\n\u201cA curfew,\u201d the man says with a decisive nod. \u201cAnd mandatory checks of all castle chambers. Cease taking in refugees from the outer regions.\u201d\nGuinevere frowns and leans forward in her chair. \u201cAnd where are our people supposed to go if the crown will not offer them shelter?\u201d\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t out of heartlessness that I suggest these measures my lady. But these are towns blighted by Morgana. You cannot know if any are spies for her turned against us by the lure of power and magic!\u201d\n\u201cBullshit,\u201d Arthur mutters and smirks when he hears Merlin scoff quietly under his breath. \n\u201cI appreciate your\u2026 passion Lord Bodin,\u201d Guinevere says delicately. \u201cI agree with your request for a curfew. An attempt was made on the life of the king. We should be vigilant. And we will post extra guards in the castle at night. I would like to take some time to consider your other proposals.\u201d\nLord Bodin looks disappointed but it only graces his face for a moment before it is replaced with a bland smile as he nods to the Queen. \u201cOf course my lady.\u201d\n\u201cSir Leon,\u201d Gwen calls. Leon stands from his seat at the table. \u201cPlease organise for extra guards to be stationed in the castle at night. And Lord Geoffrey, please send the message to the people about the curfew. It will be in place from this evening.\u201d\nThe old man nods and Arthur looks around the table, pleased that his Lords seem to be ready to take his Queen\u2019s orders. Perhaps after the tumultuous few years Camelot has endured they may finally start to see a time of peace. \nMerlin gives a slight cough and Guinevere glances at him quickly before addressing the table. \u201cIf that is all?\u201d There is a murmuring of agreement and nodding. \u201cVery well, council dismissed.\u201d\nMerlin sweeps Guinevere out of the council chambers so quickly that Arthur has to fight through the throng of dissipating Lords to catch up with them. As soon as the Queen\u2019s bedchamber door shuts behind the trio Guinevere sags in relief. \nMerlin grins at her manically. \u201cYou did so well!\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d Guinevere asks, relieved. \u201cI was so nervous. I felt like I was shaking like a leaf.\u201d\n\u201cWell you didn\u2019t show it. Arthur will be proud.\u201d\n\u201cHere, here Merlin,\u201d Arthur agrees, giving his wife a smile. \u201cYou did wonderfully.\u201d\nGwen smiles, pleased at the praise, and retreats behind her screen to change out of her formal attire. By the time she emerges Merlin has done a decent job of tidying her own chambers and is stoking the fire. Guinevere takes a seat by the fire, a relieved sigh escaping her mouth as she sinks into the plush cushions. \n\u201cRight,\u201d Merlin mutters, pushing himself up onto his feet. \u201cI will leave you to your afternoon. One of the maids will bring you dinner if that\u2019s alright.\u201d\n\u201cStay,\u201d Guinevere murmurs, reaching out to grab Merlin\u2019s wrist as he passes. \u201cWe could read and talk. I feel like we haven\u2019t spent any time together since I became Queen.\u201d\nMerlin smiles down at the Queen kindly. \u201cI wish I could Gwen but I promised Gaius I would go to the library.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll go with you. I could watch you research like I used to. You always looked so cute concentrating.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not cute,\u201d Merlin says with mock outrage. \u201cAnd you are the queen now. You can\u2019t just follow me around the castle because you\u2019re bored.\u201d\nMerlin extracts himself from Guinevere\u2019s grasp and stokes the fire one last time before retreating. \n\u201cWhen Arthur is well again I expect a picnic in the woods,\u201d Guinevere calls after the servant. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen nearly enough of you since the wedding. No matter who I am married to you are still my closest friend.\u201d\nMerlin smiles over his shoulder at the Queen. \u201cAnd you are mine. No matter what idiot you married.\u201d\nGuinevere snorts in laughter at the twinkle in Merlin\u2019s eye and throws a small cushion in his direction. Merlin squawks dramatically as he dodges the projectile and Guinevere laughs. \nArthur can do nothing but stand back and smile. \n-\nMerlin spends a few more minutes pottering about the chambers, exchanging a bit of court gossip with the Queen before he ducks out of the room. Arthur follows without really thinking about it. \nBut when the sun starts dipping towards the outer wall Arthur wishes that he had stayed in the chambers and watched Gwen knit. \n\u201cHave you found anything yet?\u201d he asks petulantly. Merlin ignores him from his table in the library and scribbles something in his little notebook. Arthur huffs and looks back at the closed library door. In theory he could just walk through it. His hands and arms seem to move through solid objects well enough. Surely he could just walk through the solid surface if he wanted to but\u2026 Arthur cringes away from the thought. Even the idea of walking through a solid object makes him feel wary. It is a little too close to spell work for his tastes. \nThough when Merlin sighs and pulls another thick ancient tome over to him Arthur seriously considers it. \nThe sound of the library door opening fills Arthur\u2019s heart with hope of escape for a moment before he notices the meandering form of Lord Bodin sauntering over to where Merlin is sat. There is something in the Lord\u2019s face that Arthur doesn\u2019t like, especially when he looks at his servant. Arthur lets the library door swing shut and moves to stand at Merlin\u2019s shoulder. \nAs the Lord nears Merlin peers up at him from beneath his lashes but doesn\u2019t speak. Even when the Lord comes to stand beside the book covered table Merlin, in flagrant disregard for all court etiquette, doesn\u2019t stand or even acknowledge the Lord\u2019s presence. \nBodin\u2019s nostrils flare. \n\u201cBoy,\u201d he barks. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\nMerlin looks up at him properly then, and then at the piles of texts littering the table. \u201cUm\u2026. Reading?\u201d \nUnder normal circumstances Arthur might have laughed but these aren\u2019t normal circumstances. Arthur glances around but it appears as if the library is as deserted as it has been all afternoon. Arthur is all but useless and Lord Bodin\u2019s face has turned a very interesting shade of red. \n\u201cDon\u2019t goad him Merlin,\u201d Arthur hisses warily, not taking his eyes of the Lord. \u201cJust get up and leave.\u201d\n\u201cDoes the King enjoy your insolence boy?\u201d Bodin asks, coming forward to lean imposingly over Merlin. \nWith his typical lack in sense of self-preservation Merlin sighs and leans back in his chair. \n\u201cMerlin,\u201d Merlin states. \nLord Bodin blinks and frowns. \u201cPardon?\u201d\n\u201cMy name,\u201d Merlin explains. \u201cIt\u2019s Merlin. So you don\u2019t keep having to call me \u2018boy\u2019. Something which I haven\u2019t been in quite some years.\u201d\nLord Bodin lets out a low exhale, closer to a growl and Arthur automatically goes for the absent sword at his waist and takes a step forward. \n\u201cCareful \u2018boy\u2019,\u201d Bodin spits, leaning far into Merlin\u2019s personal space. \u201cYou may be in the favour of the King and Queen but that won\u2019t always protect you.\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds awfully like you are threating my servant Lord Bodin,\u201d Arthur growls. Merlin it seems shares none of the worry and concern that is clutching at Arthur\u2019s chest. Instead he sends the Lord an amused smile. \n\u201cIs that a threat Lord Bodin?\u201d\nIn swift movement Lord Bodin has reached forward and grabbed Merlin roughly by the arm. Arthur\u2019s shout of alarm goes unacknowledged by either party as they stare coldly at each other. \nLord Bodin\u2019s malicious glare hardens as he spits down at Merlin. \u201cThat\u2019s the difference between you lower classes and us. I have no need to threaten. If I want to hurt someone I simply do it.\u201d\nA creak and a grumble sound from the far side of the library. Lord Bodin throws Merlin\u2019s arm away from him harshly, making Merlin\u2019s chair rock in place. In the blink of an eye the vicious Lord is gone and a bland mask is painted on his face. Then Lord Geoffrey comes out from the maze of towering books. \n\u201cAh Lord Bodin,\u201d the old man greets politely. \u201cWas there something I could help with?\u201d\n\u201cNo no,\u201d the Lord mumbles. \u201cI was simply enquiring after the King with young\u2026 Merlin.\u201d\nLord Geoffrey nods. \u201cGaius informs me the King is quite well, just requires resting. Then he will be back with us all!\u201d And he continues on his way, nose already returning to the book in his hands. \nThe appearance of Geoffrey seems to have tempered Bodin\u2019s anger a tad and when he looks back at Merlin the red hot fury in his eyes has gone. \n\u201cDon\u2019t stay here too long \u2018Merlin\u2019,\u201d the Lord says coldly. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want to be caught on the wrong side of the curfew.\u201d\nMerlin offers the Lord a smile. \u201cThank you for your concern Lord Bodin. But that\u2019s the difference between the upper classes and us\u2026 I can look after myself.\u201d\nArthur sees the muscle in Bodin\u2019s jaw tick as he stares down at Merlin and for a moment Arthur thinks he is going to lean over the table and throttle his servant. But the Lord casts a look over to the maze of books that Geoffrey had just disappeared into and backs away, letting the Library door slam shut on his exit. \nAs soon as the danger is passed Arthur sags in relief. And his relief quickly turns to anger. \n\u201cAre you trying to get yourself killed?\u201d he roars at his servant who has gone back to reading as if nothing has happened. \u201cHonestly Merlin, there is cheeky and then there is downright suicidal. I\u2019d better get back into my body soon or that man is going to have your head on a platter.\u201d\nMerlin pays him no attention and flicks to a new page of his book. Arthur sags. This feeling of powerlessness and helplessness is not something that he is accustomed too. Now his whole future lays in the hands of his servant and he is helpless to do anything but watch. \u201cPlease Merlin,\u201d he whispers. \u201cJust get me back in my body.\u201d\nEventually the sun dips too low in the sky for Merlin to see what he is reading and the man huffs and slams the old book closed. Arthur watches with sinking disappointment as Merlin cradles his head in his hands at the table. \n\u201cYou didn\u2019t find anything did you?\u201d he asks his servant. But he already knows the answer. \n-\nGaius is lent over Arthur\u2019s body on his bed when he and Merlin return that evening. Guinevere is standing nervously close by and Merlin makes an immediate beeline for the Queen, resting a reassuring hand on her shoulder. \nAfter lots of prodding and manipulation of Arthur\u2019s limbs Gaius steps back. \n\u201cAnything?\u201d Guinevere asks hopefully. \n\u201cNo My Lady,\u201d Gaius says. \u201cBut we have not yet finished researching the manner of the Kings sleep. As soon as we know what has caused this I am confident that he will return to full health. For the moment he merely seems to be sleeping comfortably.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine Guinevere,\u201d Arthur whispers. He goes to put a hand on her shoulder on the other side of Merlin but it falls through her body. With a sigh Arthur continues. \u201cGaius will find something. Or maybe Merlin. You should have seen the number of books he trawled through in the library today. Something will come up soon.\u201d\n\u201cIn fact,\u201d Gaius was continuing, \u201cI have a number of references that I need to look through tonight. I wondered if you would let Merlin have leave to assist me?\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Guinevere says quickly. \u201cI can get someone else to serve me dinner. Merlin should be where he can be most useful.\u201d\n\u201cWould you like me to send someone to keep you company?\u201d Merlin asks, gazing at Guinevere\u2019s worried face. \n\u201cNo I think I would like to be alone for a while.\u201d\nArthur\u2019s heart aches with the need to comfort her. She looks so tired and worried and she shouldn\u2019t. Arthur had promised to care for her and look after her and he has left her on her own to deal with it all. With a shared look Merlin and Gaius retreat from the room quietly. Arthur watches them leave but cannot seem to make himself leave his wife\u2019s side. \n-\nWhen Merlin turns up later that night Guinevere has settled into a chair beside Arthur\u2019s bed with a small book in hand, Arthur hovering nearby. \nMerlin just offers Guinevere a small smile and sets about quietly tidying the room. A peace settles into the bedchamber filled with the quiet scuffles of Merlin and the whispering rustle of paper as Guinevere turns a page. \nIt is broken after a few minutes by a knock at the door. Guinevere and Arthur look up but Merlin just sends the Queen a smile and rushes to open it. \n\u201cWho is it?\u201d Guinevere asks cautiously. \n\u201cThis, is Sir Gwaine,\u201d Merlin says with a flourish and opens the door wide enough to show Gwaine stood in the threshold. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you have met but he is one of Camelot\u2019s fiercest knights.\u201d\n\u201cThe most handsome too,\u201d Gwaine says as he steps through the open door, sending a wink in the Queen\u2019s direction. \n\u201cThere\u2019s still debate about that,\u201d Merlin says as he closes the door in Gwaine\u2019s wake. \nGwaine huffs and turns to Merlin with a frown. \u201cWho else is even in contention?\u201d\n\u201cWell the Queen\u2019s brother is nothing to sneer at. And there is Sir Humphries of course.\u201d\n\u201cSir Humphries is balding and red faced!\u201d Gwaine says, clearly affronted. \nArthur just watches the back and forth between his servant and knight with an amused smile for a moment. You can always count on Merlin and Gwaine to provide you with the evening\u2019s entertainment. \n\u201cAlright, alright you two,\u201d Guinevere chuckles after a while. The two of them stop their banter and look at their Queen. \u201cGwaine what do you need?\u201d\nMerlin steps forward with a smile. \u201cSir Gwaine has gallantly volunteered to sit with our King for the evening so that you can get some sleep in an actual bed.\u201d\n\u201cOh no,\u201d Gwen says, shaking her head. \u201cI couldn\u2019t.\u201d\nMerlin sighs and comes forward to clasp a warm hand to the Queen\u2019s shoulder. \u201cGwen. It wasn\u2019t a suggestion. You spent all last night in that chair. Go to your chambers and sleep properly. Whilst Arthur is napping you carry Camelot. You can\u2019t do that on tired slumping shoulders.\u201d\nMerlin and Guinevere just look at each other for a moment and Arthur can see the silent messages flowing between them in a way only possible with the oldest of friends. Whatever silent debate they are having Merlin obviously wins as Guinevere sighs and drops her shoulders, betraying her tiredness. \n\u201cOk. Ok I will retire to my chambers. Thank you Gwaine,\u201d she says kindly. \n\u201cNot at all My Queen,\u201d Gwaine says with a smile. \u201cMake sure you get some rest.\u201d\nMerlin offers his hand to Guinevere who levers herself up and leans into his body as he escorts her across the room to her adjoining door. She looks back at Arthur\u2019s body for a moment and Merlin gives her a little squeeze. \u201cGo on Gwen,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cGo get some sleep.\u201d\nShe sighs and turns back towards her rooms. \u201cI will. But you do too Merlin,\u201d she says sternly, eyeing Merlin\u2019s face. \nArthur looks properly at his servant, copying his wife\u2019s concerned stare. Guinevere has always coddled Merlin but even Arthur can see the man looks tired. \nMerlin sends Guinevere a bland smile, even as he ushers her closer to the door. \n\u201cOf course. Goodnight Gwen.\u201d\nGuinevere gives Arthur\u2019s body one last look before she turns away into her own rooms. \n\u201cGoodnight Guinevere,\u201d Arthur calls out as the door to her chambers closes. \n\u201cAre you actually going to go get some sleep?\u201d Gwaine asks from behind. When Arthur turns he sees that the man has already taken up the Queen\u2019s vacated seat and propped his booted feet up on the edge of Arthur\u2019s royal bed. \nMerlin snorts. \u201cWhat do you think? And get your feet off the bed. I\u2019m the one that has to clean that you know.\u201d\nGwaine rolls his eyes but obliges, albeit reluctantly. In the background the tower bells tolls once. \n\u201cThat\u2019s your cue to get back to your chambers,\u201d Gwaine says. Merlin glances between the window and the mess of papers around the chamber and the untended fire in the grate. \n\u201cLeave it,\u201d Gwaine instructs. \u201cI can tend my own fire. If the guards catch you out after curfew Arthur isn\u2019t around to get you out of trouble.\u201d\nMerlin sends him a grateful smile, already hurrying to the door. \nThe hallways of the castle are dark now, but Merlin seems to traverse them with familiarity. Not often one to sneak around his castle at night it takes a moment for Arthur to realise that they are not heading towards Gaius\u2019 chambers. Instead Merlin glances over his shoulder before pushing open the door of the Library. \n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Arthur hisses as his servant moves deeper into the towers of books. \u201cIf the guards catch you in here past curfew you\u2019ll be thrown in the cells!\u201d\nMerlin moves silently through the racks layering a tower of books in his arms as he goes. He eventually settles down on the floor below the window, where the moonlight casts a blue light over the floor and opens the first book. \nArthur loses track of how long they spend in the library, but he is sure that it is deep into the night by the time Merlin finally rises from the floor. He doesn\u2019t make a sound but Arthur can see from the unhappy line of his shoulders that he has again found nothing of use. \nThey only encounter three sets of guards on their journey back to Gaius\u2019 chambers which Merlin dodges so deftly that Arthur is sure this is not the first time he has done this. It feels like the entire castle is asleep aside from Merlin and when they quietly enter Gaius\u2019 chambers the old man is fast asleep on his little cot. \nMerlin takes a moment to clear up some of the debris of the day from Gaius\u2019 table and puts away some vials and bowls before he finally retires himself. \nWith a tired sigh Merlin drops his body ungracefully to sitting on the edge of his bed. The poor timber structure gives an ominous creek but holds together. \nAs disappointed as Arthur is to still be a ghostly presence in his own castle he cannot deny that Merlin has done everything he can to rectify the situation today. In fact, if pressed, he might even admit that he is slightly proud of his little servant. Juggling chores, researching an ailment of a King, assisting the Queen and playing physician all in one day is no mean feat. \n\u201cWould you go to sleep already Merlin,\u201d Arthur grouses, taking up a perch on the edge of the desk. \u201cYou are making me tired just looking at you.\u201d In fact his servant looks positively worn ragged slumped over on the bed with his head resting in his hands. The man has easily been awake for a full day and night and the dark shadows beneath his eyes that Guinevere had been eyeing worriedly hang heavy. \nSeeming to hear Arthur\u2019s rebuke Merlin toes off his boots clumsily and shifts back onto the bed. \nArthur just watches for a moment as Merlin lays back on the bed, fully clothed, above the covers and with eyes wide open in the candlelight. When a few breaths pass and Merlin seems no closer to moving Arthur huffs. \n\u201cAnd you wonder why I call you useless Merlin. You can\u2019t possibly go to sleep like that. At least dowse the candle-\u201c\nBut Arthur\u2019s rant is cut off in a choke when Merlin\u2019s eyes flare bright gold and the candle goes out instantly, plunging the room into darkness and hefting like a punch to Arthur\u2019s stomach.\nArthur might have thought that he had been mistaken. It could have simply been a trick of the light. A light breeze could have entered the chambers and blown out the candles. A strange flaring of the moon could have caught Merlin\u2019s eyes, making them appear to glow\u2026 \nHe may have thought that if not for the very next morning, when Merlin wakes just before the sun and warms his cleaning water with a gesture and a swirl of gold through his eyes. \nArthur just stares as the water in the bowl goes from stale and cold to scented and steaming in just a few seconds. Merlin \u2013 his servant \u2013 his magical servant \u2013 just disrobes without a care and cleans himself quickly and efficiently in the magically hot water.\nThe dispensing of the power - the very illegal magical power \u2013 is just so casual that Arthur is under no illusion that Merlin does this every day. It is that thought that unclogs Arthur\u2019s throat. \n\u201cMagic?!\u201d he yells at his unresponsive servant. \u201cMagic Merlin?! What type of complete idiot are you? Do you know what the guards would do to you if they got their hands on you? Do you have any idea what I am going to do the moment I can get my hands on you? Of all the ridiculous, hair brained things you have done over the years Merlin this has absolutely got to be at the top of the list -\u201d\nArthur\u2019s yells follow Merlin all through the man getting dressed and continue as he descends into the main physician\u2019s chamber. \nGaius is already awake and dishing some thick creamy substance into two bowls as they enter. \n\u201c- and you!\u201d Arthur cries turning his glare onto the physician. \u201cDid you have any idea about this? Do you know that your ward is practicing magic under the roof of my castle?!\u201d\nGaius ignores him and pushes a steaming bowl of gruel over the table towards Merlin as he drops onto the bench. \n\u201cYou came in late last night,\u201d Gaius says, taking his own seat. \u201cIs the Queen alright?\u201d\n\u201cGwen\u2019s\u2026 as ok as she can be,\u201d Merlin sighs, running a hand through already dishevelled hair. \u201cI left her with instructions to get some sleep.\u201d\n\u201cInstructions I see you did not follow yourself,\u201d Gaius says with a lifted eyebrow. \nMerlin just snorts and shovels another spoonful of breakfast into his mouth. \u201cI\u2019ll sleep when Arthur\u2019s back with us.\u201d\n\u201cOh yes you will,\u201d Arthur scoffs from where he stands over their breakfast table. \u201cYou can sleep all you want back in Ealdor because that is where you are going the minute I wake up. I allow you a lot of liberties Merlin but this\u2026\u201d Arthur sighs and turns away from the table. \nHe can\u2019t believe this. Of all of the people he knows. Of all the people he trusts he never thought that it would be Merlin who betrayed him. Who broke his laws and defiled his judgement. Just the thought rips at something deep in his stomach and he finds he has to swallow away a lump in his throat. \n\u201cI\u2019d better get to Gwen,\u201d Merlin says behind him. That draws Arthur back to the moment with a panic. A sorcerer is about to go and serve his wife breakfast and she has no idea. \n\u201cNo you don\u2019t!\u201d Arthur cries charging after Merlin and out the door. \nArthur shouts all the way from the physician chambers to the kitchen to the royal chambers. He tries grabbing Merlin, he tries standing in his way, he tries holding doors closed but every time Merlin just breezes through his body like he doesn\u2019t exist. \nWhen they enter the Queen\u2019s bedroom Guinevere is already up and dressed standing at her writing desk. She glances up as they enter and sends Merlin a large and kind smile. \n\u201cMerlin, morning.\u201d\n\u201cMorning to you too My Queen,\u201d Merlin says with a mock bow, placing her full plate of food on the table. She responds kindly and lets Merlin pull out her chair for her as she sits down. \n\u201cDon\u2019t fall for it Guinevere!\u201d Arthur shouts, almost tearing his hair out in frustration. \u201cHe\u2019s a sorcerer!\u201d \nShe ignores him and tucks into her food, chatting amicably with Merlin about the council session from the day before. When it comes to the topic of Lord Bodin Arthur notices the tightening of Merlin\u2019s shoulders. \n\u201cWhat do you think of Lord Bodin\u2019s proposals?\u201d Gwen asks after a few more mouthfuls of her porridge. \n\u201cOh I don\u2019t know Gwen,\u201d Merlin mumbles fussing over the fireplace. \n\u201cPlease?\u201d Gwen says with wide eyes. \u201cYou give Arthur your council. I would be grateful for it too.\u201d\n\u201cHe does not give me council,\u201d Arthur says in a rage. \u201cHe bumbles out incoherencies and occasionally stumbles across something wise!\u201d\nAfter a few moments pause Merlin looks up from his crouch by the mantle, fire poker in hand. \u201cPerhaps the curfew is wise at this time. But the barring of refugees\u2026\u201d he sighs and shakes his head, \u201cI don\u2019t think that helps anyone. And I don\u2019t believe that his sole motivation is the protection of the crown.\u201d\n\u201cAnd yours is sorcerer?\u201d Arthur spits, unable to contain the rage bubbling in his chest. \nHow could Merlin sit there, squatting in the filth of the fireplace and offer the Queen of Camelot advice on running the Kingdom? Who did the man think he was? That he could advise the Crown and duck behind their backs and deliberately go against their will and laws. \nHow could he do that to Camelot? How could he do that to Guinevere\u2026 How could he do that to Arthur? \nGuinevere just nods in agreement with the traitor and mumbles; \u201cMe neither.\u201d\nThe room descends into silence. Guinevere back to her breakfast, Merlin back to his cleaning, Arthur back to his raging. Eventually Merlin stands, brushing the fire dust from his breeches and bids Guinevere goodbye with a promise to see her in Arthur\u2019s chambers for lunch. \nThere is no way that Arthur is letting this magical servant out of his sight. Swift as his training has taught him to be Arthur slips out of the door and follows his servant into the hall. \n-\nArthur watches Merlin all morning, giving his servant a level of attention that he has never offered the man before. He watches the man go through his daily routine once more but this time with a heavy knowledge of betrayal stinging the back of his mind. \nAnd Merlin is good, Arthur will give him that. Not once during the day does Arthur see his fa\u00e7ade of bumbling servant slip. He is guilelessly smiling as the Cook berates him for pinching a fresh roll. He is warm and friendly with the castle laundress as he picks up Arthur\u2019s clothing. He laughs and jokes along with the Knights on the training ground. \nBut if you look close enough you can see it. Like how the pile of clothes Merlin nearly drops neatly slip back into his grasp. Like how the roll he is eating is re-warmed with a flash of his eyes. Like how Elyan\u2019s shoulder is miraculously looser and less swollen after Merlin lays his hands on it. \nEventually they make their way up to Arthur\u2019s chambers after the midday meal and Arthur could not help but ask himself \u2018why?\u2019. \nWhy would Merlin of all people be coerced into the dark evils of magic? Why would his idiot fool of a servant learn magics to simply heat his cleaning water and dowse a candle? And then the darkest of all questions: is Merlin in league with Morgana? Just the mere thought sends a shiver of fear and heartbreak up Arthur\u2019s spine. It is true that the two of them had been close before Morgana turned, arguably closer than a Lady and a servant should be. Is it possible they were working together? That Merlin was taking Camelot down from within?\nEven after the magics Arthur has seen he refuses to believe this. Merlin has been there for every one of Morgana\u2019s torments, has suffered along with Arthur and his people and has been instrumental in regaining Camelot and recapturing the throne. Arthur just cannot believe it\u2026 yet he has been fooled before\u2026\nMerlin enters the chambers to find Guinevere and Gaius already there. \nGuinevere turns at the servant\u2019s entrance, her eyes sorrowful and pleading. \u201cGaius hasn\u2019t found a cure yet,\u201d she says, her voice choking against tears. \nArthur\u2019s heart breaks at the pain in his wife\u2019s voice and then doubles as watches a traitorous sorcerer wind his arm around the Queen\u2019s shoulders and give it a reassuring squeeze. \n\u201cDon\u2019t give up hope yet Gwen, there is still a fair number of avenues Gaius has yet to try.\u201d\n\u201cMerlin is right My Lady,\u201d Gaius says with an encouraging smile. \u201cIn fact, there is one source I would like to show you, for you to approve a try at treatment.\u201d\n\u201cOf course, Gaius, we trust you.\u201d\n\u201cI am afraid the tome is quite large My Lady. Quite unwieldy to carry. I wondered if you could accompany me to my chambers?\u201d\nGuinevere looks down at Arthur\u2019s sleeping body and then at Gaius\u2019 waiting face, indecision clear in her face.\n\u201cI\u2019ll stay with Arthur,\u201d Merlin says comfortingly, giving her shoulders another squeeze. \u201cMake sure he doesn\u2019t go running off into more trouble.\u201d\nWith a start Arthur realises exactly what they are doing, and a fissure of fear runs through him.\nArthur rushes to Guinevere\u2019s side, even as Gaius ushers her from the room. \u201cGuinevere,\u201d he pleads quietly, willing with everything that he has that she could just hear him. \u201cDon\u2019t trust them. They are magic users. They are tricking you. Please. Don\u2019t leave my body alone with Merlin. Guinevere!\u201d\nBut it is no use. His wife doesn\u2019t blink or react to his pleading and the chamber door shuts definitively behind her and Gaius. Leaving just Arthur, his body, and a known sorcerer alone in his room. \nMerlin makes his way over to Arthur\u2019s sleeping form slowly, peering over his shoulder with every step. He stands for a moment, looking over the lifeless body on the bed, his hands on his hips, assessing. \n\u201cIt is always you isn\u2019t it Arthur,\u201d Merlin murmurs after a while. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t Questing Beasts it\u2019s dragons or bandits or enchanted bracelets. Are you just trying to make my job difficult?\u201d\nMerlin places one hand gently against Arthur\u2019s forehead and Arthur starts at the sensation that he can actually feel this touch; the only thing he has felt since he woke like this. His eyes widen, and he stumbles forward a few steps to better see his prone body. \n\u201cMerlin, what are you doing?\u201d he asks in wonder but then he looks up and sees Merlin\u2019s eyes wide open and bright with molten gold. \nHe gasps and startles backwards without much thought, tripping over Guinevere\u2019s discarded chair and ending up on the floor. \nArthur jumps back up as quickly as he can, raging forward to where his servant \u2013 his once true and faithful servant \u2013 is performing magic on his body. The violation sends shivers down his spine. \n\u201cStop this!\u201d he roars at Merlin. \u201cStop this now!\u201d \nBut Merlin doesn\u2019t hear him. With a dejected sigh Merlin removes his hand from Arthur\u2019s brow and Arthur feels the heat retreat with it. \n\u201cAlright, so that didn\u2019t work,\u201d Merlin mumbles, frowning in thought. \u201cHow about\u2026\u201d Merlin leans forward over Arthur\u2019s body, placing both hands on Arthur\u2019s chest. \nArthur gasps as he feels the heat again, piercing through his ribs and reaching straight for his heart. Merlin\u2019s eyes glow again and this time he whispers a few unintelligible words. Arthur has been attacked by enough sorcerers to understand them as words of the Old Religion. He has to grit his teeth against the renewed pain of betrayal. \nBut again, the magic doesn\u2019t seem to have done anything. Arthur still feels as normal as possible and his sleeping body looks just as peaceful as it has done since this sleep began. Merlin sighs in defeat sinking away from Arthur\u2019s body to sit on the edge of the bed. \n\u201cWhat was that supposed to achieve?\u201d Arthur hisses ominously at his servant. \u201cIs this sleep your doing? Were you looking to finish the job?!\u201d\nBut Merlin doesn\u2019t respond. He just looks down at Arthur\u2019s body, something of the heartbreak Arthur is feeling mirrored in his eyes. \n\u201cOk,\u201d Merlin sighs. \u201cOne more try. Do try not to be difficult this time Arthur.\u201d\nThe servant stands, rolling his shoulders back and levelling his hands to hover above Arthur\u2019s prone body. Then something builds. Arthur can feel it, like a thunder storm on the brink of breaking. Power courses through the room and when he looks up Merlin\u2019s eyes are golden once more, brighter and more terrifying than ever before. \nThe sound that escapes Merlin\u2019s mouth is not much better; deep and growling and chilling. A gust of air appears from nowhere, gushing out into the room fluttering the curtains and bed coverings. Arthur is about to scream and yell but then he stops. He feels something. \nThere is a tugging in his chest, right behind his rib cage. As if something is pulling him, drawing him back in. Arthur watches with awe as the eyes beneath his body\u2019s eyelids begin to twitch. \nMerlin sees it too and his face explodes into a triumphant grin. \u201cYes Arthur,\u201d he calls. \u201cCome on, come back to us.\u201d\nThe tugging intensifies, and Arthur finds himself stumbling towards the bed, his gaze flicking back and forth between his awakening body and Merlin\u2019s grimacing face. It is clear that whatever spell Merlin is performing is hard work. Sweat beads on his forehead, trickling down his face which is becoming an ever-deeper shade of red under the strain. \n\u201cIt\u2019s working,\u201d Arthur says in wonder, staring up at Merlin in astonishment. \u201cMerlin, it\u2019s working. Come on!\u201d \nThe pulling intensifies, reaching to a crescendo. Merlin growls, the tendons in his neck bulging from the strain. The power in the room crackles and builds and then there is an almighty snap. \nArthur feels himself being thrown backwards with the strength of it and lands hard on the chamber ground. He struggles up, quickly, looking to see if it had worked. But when he sees Merlin leant, heaving in deep breaths over Arthur\u2019s still body he knows it hasn\u2019t. \n\u201cDammit!\u201d Merlin curses, slapping a hand harshly against the bedpost in anger. Arthur startles at the display but Merlin quickly sags into the very picture of dejection. Running a hand through his sweat slick hair he looks down on Arthur\u2019s body, an air of hopelessness about him that Arthur has never seen. \n\u201cWhat-\u201d Arthur tries to say but his voice sticks. \u201cDid you just try to heal me?\u201d \nMerlin doesn\u2019t respond but the disappointment in his servant\u2019s face is answer enough. \n\u201cYou did,\u201d Arthur says in wonder. \u201cYou tried to use your magic to heal me.\u201d \nAnd again, the question of \u2018why?\u2019 flitters to the front of Arthur\u2019s mind. \nMagic is evil. Sorcery is a power that corrupts and twists a person\u2019s soul. So why is Merlin \u2013 a proven magic user \u2013 trying to heal the King of Camelot? \nGaius and Gwen return swiftly and after a few pleasantries the pair leave Guinevere to her evening. For once Arthur does not feel compelled to follow Merlin as he exits the chambers. Arthur lets the door shut behind Merlin\u2019s back, his mind a conflicting mess of confusion, pain and betrayal. \n-\nGuinevere only spends a few candle marks in Arthur\u2019s chambers, flicking between reading court documents and glancing at Arthur\u2019s body every few moments. Arthur spends his time pondering his servant. \nThe man has magic. He has broken Arthur\u2019s laws and visibly flouts them. Yet\u2026 Merlin has always been loyal, almost to a fault; constantly throwing himself into harms way to protect Arthur and his Knights. And he just tried to heal Arthur. And judging by his devastation when he couldn\u2019t, really wanted Arthur to recover. \nThis merging of loyal friend with magic isn\u2019t something that Arthur has any experience with. Everything his father had taught him tells him it isn\u2019t possible. And yet\u2026 \nGuinevere leaves the chambers later that afternoon and takes a visit to the Castle Steward to discuss the castle supplies. Arthur follows behind dutifully, his mind elsewhere. \nAs he thinks about it Merlin having magic does make a lot strange situations make more sense. Bandits that suddenly fall over, branches that conveniently drop onto axe wielding opponents, strange winds and earthquakes that take out Camelot\u2019s enemies. Looking even further back Arthur is sure it must have been Merlin that conjured that wind in Ealdor. Or did he learn magics from his friend when they were both too young and too na\u00efve to understand its evils? \nSo caught up in his own thoughts is Arthur that it takes him a few corridors of walking before he realises he has lost Guinevere somewhere in their travels. He assumes she will have moved onto speaking with Geoffrey and Arthur could track her down, but he is overcome with a wave of tiredness. \nHe turns, taking the familiar route back up to his own chambers. \nThe door is thankfully open when he arrives, and his spirits naturally lift when he sees his Round Table Knights gathered around his dining table. They seem to be talking animatedly and a closer look at the table sees it littered with the guard rotas and patrol schedule. \n\u201cWe need to switch the position of these guards,\u201d Leon is saying, pointing at an aerial map of the castle. \u201cGwaine you will need to take up the command of the night patrol next week to check the new arrangements.\u201d\n\u201cI was on night duty last week,\u201d the Knight complains. \u201cPlus, I played nurse maid to our resting king last night.\u201d He nods his head over to the closed curtains around Arthur\u2019s bed. \u201cI need to sleep sometime.\u201d\n\u201cWell what do you suggest?\u201d\n\u201cYou do it. When was the last time you took a night shift?\u201d\n\u201cI have to assist the Queen and organise the Knight\u2019s training whilst Arthur is\u2026 unavailable.\u201d\n\u201cGuys, come on.\u201d The voice comes from the corner of the room and Arthur notices Merlin for the first time, sat behind his desk with a quill in hand. \u201cI\u2019m trying to work here.\u201d\nThe knights spare him a small glance before they turn back to the table. \n\u201cWhat about the patrol in the Northern Plains?\u201d Percival asks. \u201cIt was due to leave in three days, but Arthur still hasn\u2019t finalised the route he wants.\u201d\n\u201cI think we should take the route through the Darkling Woods, then up to the northern pass,\u201d Elyan says, consulting a map of Camelot. \n\u201cBut that completely misses the main trade route between here and Mercia,\u201d Gwaine argues. \u201cWe need to ensure its safety for travelling merchants.\u201d\nElyan huffs in annoyance. \u201cBut then the patrol would take over two weeks. We cannot spare that many men for that long.\u201d\n\u201cThen send fewer,\u201d Gwaine says with a sharp tone. \n\u201cThat\u2019s too dangerous. If Arthur were here-\u201d\n\u201cWell he\u2019s not so can we just make a decision so I can go get some blasted sleep!\u201d\n\u201cEnough!\u201d Merlin\u2019s voice roars through the room. All the knights, and Arthur, start at the shout and turn to see the servant now stood behind the desk, staring at the crowd of Knights with blazing eyes. \u201cArthur has barely been gone two days and you are already cracking at the seams. You need to stop bickering and work together!\u201d\n\u201cLeon,\u201d Merlin barks. \u201cYour Queen has already given you a task that needs to be completed. It may not be your preferred duty, but it is important. You will leave to see Lord Ulcan at first light.\u201d Leon opens his mouth as if to protest but before he can Merlin continues. \u201cElyan\u2019s arm still needs to recover so for the time being he will take over the Knight\u2019s training and act as the Queen\u2019s council on matters of the army. Percival, pick heads or tails.\u201d\nThe knight blinks in confusion and shares a look with his fellow knights. \u201cUm... what?\u201d he asks timidly. \nMerlin has moved from behind the desk, holding a coin in hand. \u201cI said pick; heads or tails.\u201d\n\u201cTails.\u201d\nMerlin flips the coin, expertly flicking it spiralling up onto the air and catching it again in hand. \u201cHeads,\u201d he calls. \u201cSo, Percival will take the night shift for this week and Gwaine will cover the day guards. Next week you switch. The new patrol routes can wait until either Elyan recovers, Leon returns or Arthur wakes, whichever comes first. Any questions?\u201d\nSilence is all that responds the servant\u2019s tirade. \n\u201cExcellent,\u201d he says with a sigh. \u201cNow will you all, for the love of the Gods, go away so I can finish this speech?\u201d\nMumbles of \u201cYes Merlin\u201d and \u201cSorry Merlin\u201d echo through the space and with a scraping of papers and chairs the Knights disperse. \nAs his Knights all wander off to follow their orders Arthur wants to rage and curse; who does Merlin \u2013 a traitor and magic user \u2013 think he is to direct Arthur\u2019s knights? But a niggling thought at the back of Arthur\u2019s mind presses forward; he cannot fault the orders. In fact, if he thinks about it, Arthur himself cannot think of a better way to solve their current staff shortages. \nHe watches with a frown as Merlin goes back to the desk and sits down with a deep sigh. \nSurely a traitorous magic user would take the opportunity of his master being incapacitated and not being watched to\u2026 steal something? Plot something? Plant some magical artefact in the rooms? But no, Merlin simply pulls the scroll he had been working on back to him and picks back up his quill. \nGuinevere returns later in the afternoon and Merlin makes his excuses to leave. Arthur lets him go. He has enough to ponder as it is. \n-\nDeep in the silence of the night there is a creak. To others it may have been nothing and disregarded, but Arthur is a warrior. The sound is unnatural in the bedchamber and the hairs on the back of Arthur\u2019s neck rise. \nOn alert Arthur stands, slowly rotating to peer into every darkened corner of his room. His eyes stray back over Guinevere who is still fast asleep in her chair and is oblivious to change in the air. Then the creak sounds again from behind Arthur and he twirls quickly to see a boot and a leg, and then an arm, come through his bedchamber window. \n\u201cGuinevere wake up!\u201d he hisses to his sleeping wife as the full body of a man pulls himself through the window. \u201cPlease Guinevere wake up!\u201d\nBut he is useless. The man stands and orientates himself in the room for a moment before his face turns towards the bed. In the dark of the night Arthur cannot make out his features but he imagines that his eyes glint with triumph at the sight of a sleeping King and Queen, no guards in sight. \nA long dagger is pulled from the figures hip, glinting dangerously in the moonshine. \n\u201cStop!\u201d Arthur shouts, standing uselessly between the intruder and his wife. \u201cGuards!\u201d he calls once more but knows in his heart that it is useless. He is going to be stuck here, invisible and impotent as his wife is murdered in her sleep. Where the hell are his guards?\nThe figure takes a single step forward and then the door to the bedchamber swings open. Arthur almost sighs with relief until he notices the highly unimposing figure of his servant in the doorway. Merlin and the intruder stop and stare at each other for a fraction of a moment before the intruder rushes forward. \nArthur watches in horror as Merlin\u2019s eyes swirl a brilliant gold and he throws his hand out before him. The assailant makes a sound, as if he has been hit with an axe, and flies through the air hitting the stone wall with a crunch. The sound finally wakes Guinevere who shrieks and two guards storm into the room, closely followed by Percival. \nArthur just stands in the centre of the mayhem, looking back and forth from the assassin and his magical traitor of a manservant\u2026 who has just saved his life. \nMerlin stands by Arthur\u2019s bed, holding a trembling Guinevere in his arms. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d he asks in a whisper. \n\u201cYes,\u201d she says nodding into Merlin\u2019s chest. \u201cYes I am Ok... Arthur!\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s fine,\u201d Merlin soothes quickly, pulling back so that Gwen can see Arthur\u2019s intact sleeping body. \n\u201cWho was that?\u201d\nPercival is standing over the crumpled body and looks over at the pair. \u201cI don\u2019t know but his crest is the same as the man who attacked Arthur in the forest.\u201d\nThere is heavy silence in the room as everyone takes that in. Eventually someone calls for Gaius to check on Arthur\u2019s body, just in case, and the guards carry the dead body of the assailant away. All the while Arthur just stands and stares and watches Merlin. \n\u201cYou saved me,\u201d Arthur whispers. \u201cWhy\u2026You\u2019re a sorcerer. Sorcerers have the tendency to want me dead. But you just saved my life. Why?\u201d\nMerlin ignores him, instead keeps his wide eyes firmly fixed on the still body on the bed as Gaius checks it over. Eventually the physician gives Arthur a good bill of health, other than the fact that he is still in an unending sleep. Guinevere rushes forward then, clasping Arthur\u2019s hand in hers but Arthur lingers back as Gaius makes his way over to Merlin\u2019s stoic form. \nArthur does not miss the way that Merlin watches the crowd, waiting for everyone to be out of earshot before he speaks. \n\u201cThis is getting out of hand Gaius,\u201d he hisses. \nGaius sighs and looks back at the body of Arthur. \u201cI agree. What are you planning to do?\u201d\nMerlin sighs a deep and heartfelt breath and looks back at Arthur\u2019s body. \u201cLeave it with me.\u201d\n\u201cThis is one of those times when you are going to do something I don\u2019t want to know about,\u201d Gaius says with a shrewd voice, eyeing his ward carefully. \nMerlin sends Gaius a ghost of his normal cheeky smile. \u201cLet\u2019s just play it safe and say yes.\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d Gaius sighs long suffering. \u201cJust be careful\u201d. \n-\nOnce Arthur has been announced as unharmed the room is cleared for the Queen to try and get some more rest. The chamber door is left open and Percival instructs three guards to be present in the chamber at all times. \nMerlin, Arthur notices, is hanging at the back of the room, uncharacteristically silent as if he were trying to blend into the background. And sure enough, as soon as Percival heads back to the Keep to rouse a watch party Merlin slips out of the room in the Knight\u2019s shadow. \nNo one in the room seems to notice the silent disappearing act his servant is trying to pull but Arthur does. And he\u2019ll be damned if he is going to let this confusing man out of his sight until he has the traitor figured out. \nWhen they get to the open corridor Percival heaves a breath and then sends Merlin a small smile. \u201cIt\u2019s a good job you were there Merlin. I don\u2019t want to think about what would have happened if you hadn\u2019t been checking on the fire at that exact moment.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Merlin chuckles, running a shaking hand through his hair. \u201cLucky right?\u201d\nArthur rolls his eyes as the absurdly terrible lie. Percival doesn\u2019t seem to catch it however as he just clasps Merlin on the shoulder and bids him goodnight. \nMerlin watches the knight retreat and as soon as Percival is out of sight he moves. But instead of turning right and up to the staircase that leads to the physician\u2019s chambers Merlin turns left and trots down the stone staircase that leads to the courtyard. \n\u201cWhat are you doing now you idiot?\u201d Arthur hisses behind him. The curfew is still in place and even though Merlin could give a credible reason for being out of his chambers at this hour he would still face spending the night in a cell for the trouble. \nWhen Merlin gets to the courtyard he sticks to the shadows, dipping in and out of the alley ways and crevices of the castle until they arrive at the East Gate. \nA pair of guards sit on a couple of crates by the gateway rolling a set of die against the stone floor between them. Arthur rolls his eyes. No wonder assassins are able to penetrate his castle when the guards are too busy gambling to guard the gates. \nMerlin pauses in an alleyway and peers at the guards. Arthur watches intently, interested to see what trick Merlin is planning to pull now. \nMerlin\u2019s eyes dart about until they land on a trio of barrels stood outside one of the street\u2019s stores. With a flash of gold in his eyes the barrels tip and start rolling down the cobbled walkway and Arthur cannot help but snort. Really, all that magical power and this is how Merlin chooses to distract his guards? It will never work. \nThe sound draws the guard\u2019s attention away from their game and the pair frown into the darkness. With a shared look they grab their spears and then Arthur looks on in amazement as his guards \u2013 the well respected and highly trained guards of Camelot \u2013 are outwitted by a pair of rolling barrels. \nMerlin takes his moment swiftly, darting out from his hiding place and out through the unguarded gateway without hesitation. \n\u201cYou did that with great confidence Merlin,\u201d Arthur hisses as he follows his servant out into the night. \u201cIt is almost as if you have done this before.\u201d\nMerlin looks back over his shoulder at the towering sight of Camelot Castle and turns, striding purposefully through the tall grass towards the forest. \nThen, as soon as they are hidden from sight Merlin breaks into a run. \nHis long legs pick easily through the dense forest floor, yet he makes no sound, displaces no branches and passes through the forest like the ghost that Arthur is. Even in his ghostly state Arthur has to push with everything that he has to keep up. But Merlin just keeps going. \nThey run directly through the thickness of the trees that surround Camelot, not adhering to any pathway that Arthur is aware of. As the moon is blotted out by the dense tree branches above Arthur loses all sense of direction and where they are. Forcing his burning legs even faster he pushes to keep up with Merlin lest he fall behind and get lost in his own forest. \nWhen Merlin finally comes to a stop it is at the edge of a huge grassy clearing. Arthur hurtles out of the tree line next to him, his breath coming out of him in sharp pants. \n\u201cI have to admit that was impressive,\u201d Arthur pants, eyeing Merlin\u2019s calm and unruffled demeanour. \u201cI knew you were purposefully noisy on hunts! You-\u201c\nBut whatever was on the tip of Arthur\u2019s tongue promptly dissolves at the sight before him. A dragon. An honest to the gods, tall as the trees dragon sits in front of him in the clearing staring down at Merlin with large amber eyes. And Merlin, the idiot, is just staring back. \nThen the beast smiles, exposing a row of shiny white and very pointy teeth. \nArthur reacts automatically and dives forward, trying to grab a hand around Merlin\u2019s arm and drag him away. But his hand just falls through his servant\u2019s body. \nTerror engulfs him as the snarling beast lowers his head towards Merlin. And then he blinks because the beast isn\u2019t lowering his head to chomp Merlin\u2019s body in half. He is lowering into a bow. \nMerlin returns it with a slight bow of his own and then smiles up at the creature. \n\u201cThank you for coming,\u201d he says quietly into the night. \n\u201cI will always answer your call Young Warlock. What need do you have of me tonight?\u201d\nArthur almost stumbles over backwards in shock as the beast speaks. He had always been taught that Dragons were beasts. But this one sitting before him speaking as eloquently as any Lord in Arthur\u2019s council. \n\u201cIt\u2019s Arthur,\u201d Merlin says with a sigh. \nThe Dragon rolls his eyes. \u201cIsn\u2019t it always?\u201d\n\u201cThis time\u2026 he\u2019s been enchanted but I don\u2019t know how or by what.\u201d Arthur hears an uncharacteristic thread of panic in Merlin\u2019s voice. \u201cA group of men infiltrated Arthur\u2019s tent on patrol and chanted over him with a crystal. By the time they were fought off Arthur was asleep and nothing has been able to wake him.\u201d\n\u201cI see,\u201d the Dragon murmured. \u201cHave you tried to wake him?\u201d\n\u201cOf course I tried! But it is like there\u2019s something baring me from his life-force. Have you heard of anything like this before?\u201d\nArthur watches as the Dragon\u2019s face pulls into something frightfully similar to the human expression of contemplation. \n\u201cThe Druids often used crystals to promote healing and spiritual growth but these magical practices of men are foreign to me young Warlock. You would do better speaking with the Druids directly.\u201d \nMerlin sags comically at that, letting out a heartfelt groan. \u201cI was afraid you would say that.\u201d\n\u201cYou are a strange creature Emrys,\u201d the Dragon chuckles fondly. Arthur frowns at the name. It tickles something of a memory at the back of his mind but he cannot place it. \u201cYou have faced down many a deadly magical foe yet worry about facing a group of old men in tattered robes?\u201d \nMerlin shifts and looks up at the dragon. \u201cThey look at me funny\u2026\u201d\nAt that the Dragon lets out a hearty laugh making Arthur start with fear. The beast just shakes its huge head and looks down at Merlin once more. \u201cThey look at you with respect.\u201d\n\u201cNo wonder it seems so foreign to me,\u201d Merlin scoffs. The servant sighs and runs a hand through his hair, shoulders sagging as if the weight of the world rested on them. \n\u201cYou look tired young warlock,\u201d the Dragon murmurs.\n\u201cWhy does everyone keep telling me that?\u201d Merlin huffs with a scowl. \n\u201cMaybe because you do,\u201d Arthur and the Dragon speak at the same time. \n\u201cWell, life was stressful enough trying to keep Arthur alive when he was a Prince,\u201d Merlin says with a huff. \u201cNow he\u2019s King and he has a wife. That\u2019s a whole extra person to worry about. Then Morgana tries to take over the kingdom... again. And now this. Is it any wonder I don\u2019t look well rested?\u201d \nBoth Arthur and the Dragon watch Merlin as he paces slightly in the grass. \nArthur just cannot process what is going on. One moment his servant is a bumbling idiotic fool, but a loyal subject and friend all the same. And within one blink of an eye he is not\u2026 or he is but he is more. He is fierce and slightly terrifying and talks to dragons and casts spells and saves Arthur\u2019s life and protects Guinevere and breaks the law and lies and sneaks around and\u2026 And Arthur just wants to close his eyes and pretend this isn\u2019t happening. \n\u201cStay here for the evening,\u201d the Dragon says quietly. \nMerlin stills in his pacing and looks up at the beast. \u201cBut Arthur\u2026\u201d\n\u201cArthur is well protected by his knights and will survive without you for one night.\u201d\nMerlin scoffs. \u201cYeah that\u2019s the kind of thinking that got us into this mess to begin with.\u201d But the man sighs and runs a hand through his hair, the tiredness in his bones showing for a brief moment. \n\u201cJust until daybreak,\u201d the Dragon says lowering himself down onto the ground. \nWith one last look in the direction Arthur assumes Camelot is Merlin steps forward and lowers himself into the crease of the Dragon\u2019s bent legs, just by his head. The Dragon curls himself around, his wing and body rounding in to make a little cocoon around Merlin\u2019s body. The beast\u2019s head rests down on the grass and Merlin reaches out a hand, resting it lightly on the great scaled skull. \nSomething in Merlin\u2019s body loosens for the first time in days. Arthur almost wants to laugh that it takes laying in the arms of a terrifying, mythical beast to make Merlin relax. \nMerlin wiggles in place, edging his body into a comfortable position, but he doesn\u2019t close his eyes. Instead he stares straight up at the inkjet sky, twinkling with sporadic stars. \n\u201cI keep thinking,\u201d Merlin says quietly into the night, \u201cthat if he had known about my magic he never would have been in danger.\u201d\nArthur startles for a moment after realising that they are talking about him. He takes a step closer. \n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d the Dragon rumbles. \u201cBut there is little point living with \u2018what-ifs\u2019. If you wish to tell the young king then do so.\u201d\n\u201cBut what if he hates me.\u201d\n\u201cOne half cannot truly hate-\u201c\n\u201c-That which makes it whole,\u201d Merlin scoffs with a roll of his eyes as if it is something he has heard time and again before. \u201cI know. But you have obviously never had to deal with Arthur when he is in one of his moods.\u201d\n\u201cYou think that he would kill you?\u201d\nMerlin winces at that. Arthur does too. The bluntness of the statement strikes something deep within him that recoils. \n\u201cNo maybe not,\u201d Merlin sighs. \u201cBut\u2026 he\u2019ll be angry. He will be hurt that I have lied to him. When he feels like that he has the tendency to lash out. He may regret it later but\u2026\u201d\nMerlin leaves the sentence hanging there in the air and Arthur feels it settle around them. \n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Arthur says, surprising himself by the vehemence with which he feels it. \u201cI could never kill you Merlin. It would just be\u2026 wrong.\u201d\nThat sentiment hangs in front of Arthur for a moment, unheard by the Dragon and his servant in front of him. It feels like treason just to think it, but it is true. Merlin has lied to him yes. And that has hurt something within Arthur that he thought was untouchable. But\u2026 he cannot think of a single thing that he has seen in the past day that would deserve death. \n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it tonight Merlin,\u201d the Dragon rumbles deeply. \u201cSleep. I will wake you before sunrise.\u201d\nIt is just before dawn when Merlin startles awake from the crux of a nightmare. It isn\u2019t his first of the night. Arthur has watched all these many hours as his servant tossed and squirmed in the cradle of his dragon, fighting demons and plagues in his sleep that Arthur knew nothing of. \nEach time his struggles became too fierce the dragon would lean in and breath over Merlin, a dusting of gold settling over Merlin\u2019s body before it settled into a peaceful sleep once again\u2026 for a little while at least. \nMerlin leans forward, arms braced against his legs as he takes a deep breath to fight off the lingering panic. \n\u201cIs that you awake young warlock?\u201d the dragon grumbles, stretching his legs like a cat. \n\u201cIn a manner of speaking,\u201d Merlin says, his voice threaded and weak. \nThe dragon\u2019s wings spread as the creature comes to waking too. \u201cHow long have you been having night terrors like that?\u201d \n\u201cHow long have I lived somewhere that would execute me merely for existing?\u201d \nThe bitterness in Merlin\u2019s tone is shocking to Arthur, who has never heard his servant anything other than cheeky and guileless or wise and helpful, but the dragon doesn\u2019t comment. \nThe creature and Merlin bid each other farewell and Merlin stands in the clearing, watching the disappearing wing span of the dragon before turning and running back into the woods. \nArthur huffs, readies himself and tears after his servant into the thickness of trees. \n-\nThey make it back into the castle before the sun finishes its ascent over the East wall. Merlin heads straight for Gaius\u2019 chambers. He barrels through the main room, ignoring the physician working at his table and disappears into his own room, only to appear a moment later with a small satchel. \nArthur feels slightly dizzy but Gaius is obviously used to Merlin\u2019s erratic behaviour and just continues to grind his herbs. \n\u201cWill you be able to make excuses to Gwen for me for the day?\u201d Merlin asks at a rush, already heading towards the door. \n\u201cOf course,\u201d Gaius answers easily. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\nMerlin takes a deep breath, his face falling in gravity. \u201cThe druids.\u201d\n\u201cYou sound as if you are heading off to face a hoard,\u201d Gaius says with a chuckle, returning to his pestle. \nArthur cannot help but share the physician\u2019s amusement. In the last day Arthur has seen Merlin face down an assassin, a Lord out for his head and a dragon. Yet it is the thought of a bunch of forest dwelling pacifists that seems to make Merlin feel some disquiet. \nThey do not head straight for the forest as Arthur had expected. Merlin makes a few stops on his way, first to the kitchens with instructions for the Queen\u2019s breakfast, then to the laundress to check on Guinevere\u2019s clothes, to Leon to pass on a missive for Lord Ulcan and then to Elyan\u2019s chambers to pass on a tincture and berate him for practicing with a Mace at yesterday\u2019s training (Arthur doesn\u2019t even try to hold back his laugh at the sullen face of his Knight as Merlin forces his arm back into the sling). \nThe sun has fully risen as Merlin quickly trots down a rear servant\u2019s passage towards the lower town. \n\u201cDo you think that the Druids will be able to help?\u201d Arthur cannot help but ask. He knows it is fruitless. He knows that Merlin cannot hear him. He knows that asking magic users for help shouldn\u2019t be something he condones, but there is only so long that Arthur can just stand back and listen. \nMerlin is walking quickly through the narrow and little used walkways, he doesn\u2019t notice a figure walking up behind them. Arthur does though. His many years training for war have his hackles raising at the sound of heavy footsteps behind them. He turns but barely has time to shout out a useless call of warning before the figure is upon Merlin. \nMerlin crashes harshly into the stone wall, dropping his satchel over the cobbled floors. Only the firm grip Lord Bodin has on Merlin\u2019s tunic stops the boy from tumbling to the floor too. \n\u201cYou,\u201d Lord Bodin sneers, pushing an arm roughly against Merlin\u2019s throat. \u201cYou little worm. You are the reason the Queen rejected my proposal.\u201d\nMerlin is scrabbling against the Lord\u2019s grip, his face going red as Bodin pushes harder into his neck. Arthur shouts and hollers, attempting to grab at the Lord\u2019s shoulders and yank him away but nothing works. \n\u201cNo,\u201d Merlin wheezes. \u201cShe rejected it because it wasn\u2019t what was best for her people.\u201d\nThat doesn\u2019t seem to be what the Lord had wanted to hear and his face twists unpleasantly. \u201cYou\u2019ve always been meddling. The King is too lenient with you. Servants like you need a firm hand to keep them in place.\u201d\nBodin punctuates this with pushing even harder against Merlin\u2019s throat. \n\u201cDo something you idiot!\u201d Arthur shouts as he watches Merlin\u2019s face reach an alarming shade of red but still Merlin doesn\u2019t raise a hand and his eyes stay their normal deep blue. He lets out a pained choke, his hands grappling ineffectively at Bodin\u2019s arm. \nWith no warning the Lord lets go abruptly and Merlin collapses into a heap by his feet. \n\u201cTake that as a warning \u2018boy\u2019,\u201d the Lord spits, leaning down menacingly over Merlin\u2019s panting form. \u201cStay out of my business.\u201d\nWith a final growl the Lord turns, striding back up the alleyway to the castle. \nArthur is torn between chasing after the Lord who dare inflict punishment on one of his staff and staying by Merlin\u2019s side. He looks down to see Merlin still sat on the floor, his hand massaging at his throat as he aims a dangerous glare at Bodin\u2019s back. Arthur doesn\u2019t like that look. It is a look that means Merlin is about to something foolish and brave and ridiculous. \n\u201cThat almost sounds like a threat Lord Bodin,\u201d Merlin gasps at the Lord\u2019s back just before he is out of earshot and Arthur groans. \nJust as expected Lord Bodin twirls back in anger, his glare once more on the servant he has left crumbled on the stone floor. \n\u201cI see that warning requires a little more force,\u201d the Lord growls, clenching his gloved fists by his side. \nArthur moves instinctually between the advancing Lord and his servant knowing it will do no good. The Lord advances menacingly and Merlin doesn\u2019t even try to get up off the floor. The Lord\u2019s eyes hold nothing but contempt and Arthur has a moment of pure treasonous thought as he wills Merlin to do something, anything, to stop the Lord in his tracks. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d\nArthur never thought he would be glad to hear Sir Gwaine\u2019s voice. He sags in relief as the tension in the air is broken and Gwaine marches purposefully down the alleyway. \nHis clever eyes quickly take in Merlin on the floor and the Lord\u2019s angry face and they harden. When neither Bodin nor Merlin make any move to talk the knight growls again. \n\u201cI asked what is going on here!\u201d\n\u201cNothing Sir Knight,\u201d Lord Bodin simpers. \u201cYoung Merlin here just fell. I was simply offering him a helping hand.\u201d\nArthur snorts at the ridiculous lie and it seems that Gwaine doesn\u2019t buy it either as his eyes narrow at the Lord. \n\u201cMerlin?\u201d he asks, his hand straying to his sword helm. \nMerlin looks between the Lord and Gwaine and swallows. \u201cI\u2019m fine Gwaine.\u201d \nGwaine stares at Merlin hard who looks back and shakes his head minutely. If Arthur were not watching Merlin carefully he never would have noticed it, but Gwaine does. The knight\u2019s face closes off and he turns back to the Lord. \n\u201cYou heard the man, he\u2019s fine. Best be getting back to the castle my Lord,\u201d Gwaine says with the falsest possible smile. He has surreptitiously placed himself between Bodin and Merlin and Arthur (even knowing its futility) stands shoulder to shoulder with his Knight.\nBodin sends one last look over Gwaine\u2019s shoulder before he huffs and turns with a pompous flick of his cloak. \nGwaine and Arthur stand guard until the Lord has disappeared from sight, when they turn Merlin has pulled himself up to standing and reattached his satchel to his back. \n\u201cAre you truly alright?\u201d Gwaine asks with a worried frown on his face. \n\u201cI\u2019ll live,\u201d Merlin sighs, his hand going to his throat instinctively, adjusting his neckerchief to cover the worse of the red marks. Gwaine sees the marks and almost growls, staring in the direction the Lord vanished. \n\u201cIt isn\u2019t worth the trouble it would cause Gwen,\u201d Merlin says, placing a calming hand on Gwaine\u2019s forearm. He stares coldly in the direction that Bodin has disappeared. \u201cJust watch him will you?\u201d he says with a nod. \n\u201cGladly,\u201d Gwaine growls before taking in Merlin\u2019s bag and direction of travel. \u201cWhere are you off?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026 uh, I\u2019ve got something to do\u2026 for Gaius,\u201d Merlin stammers and Arthur has to roll his eyes that he ever bought his servant\u2019s ridiculous lies. \nGwaine looks at Merlin shrewdly and Arthur can see his knight knows there is more to the story, but he doesn\u2019t push. Instead he sheathes his sword and gives the servant a knowing nod. \n\u201cWell you had better hurry then.\u201d\nMerlin has already rushed off, but Arthur is still close enough to Gwaine to hear him whisper to the retreating servant\u2019s back. \n\u201cGood luck Merlin. Bring our King home.\u201d \n-\nArthur is thankful that they only run a few leagues this time. Even so, when they slow to a walk Arthur is heaving in lungsful of breath whilst Merlin doesn\u2019t seem effected at all. \n\u201cYour stamina is impressive Merlin,\u201d Arthur says between panting breaths. \u201cReally. I should have you run the Knight\u2019s endurance training. That would teach them to complain about my sprint trials.\u201d\nNaturally Merlin ignores him and instead pays careful attention at the woods around them. He picks his way cautiously forward, seemingly choosing his footfall carefully. Arthur follows Merlin\u2019s vigilant gait as they wind back and forth between the tall sinewy trees. \n\u201cWho goes there?\u201d a voice calls out from the trees. \nArthur is sure he looked at that tree just a moment before and saw nothing. Yet now there stands a young man. His rough-hewn cloak is pulled tightly around his neck, but the hood is lowered, leaving his young ruddy face exposed. It is pulled into a face of feared determination and Arthur cannot help but admire the young man for that. \n\u201cHello,\u201d Merlin says easily, sending the boy an awkward wave. \u201cI mean no harm.\u201d\nAs Merlin walks gently forward the young man stares intently at his face. All of a sudden all fear and fright is wiped from his expression which quickly falls into amazement. \n\u201cEmrys!\u201d he cries in wonder. \nArthur is left in astonishment as the Druid drops himself to his knees and actually bows down on the leaf strewn floor before Merlin. \nMerlin\u2019s face doesn\u2019t look much better than what Arthur imagines his looks like. In fact, his servant looks positively ashen as he stumbles forward to the kneeling boy. \n\u201cPlease don\u2019t do that,\u201d he says, reaching out a hand to bid the boy to rise. \nHe does, albeit slowly, still staring at Merlin with wide eyes and a slightly lowered head. \n\u201cLord Emrys,\u201d he says again in wonder. \u201cWhat\u2026 how can I serve you?\u201d\nThis is the second time that Arthur has heard the name \u2018Emrys\u2019 directed at Merlin and still it catches on something in the dark recesses of his memory, but that isn\u2019t what catches Arthur\u2019s attention this time. \n\u201cLord?\u201d Arthur says archly, raising an eyebrow at his blushing manservant. \u201cMore secrets Merlin? Really I\u2019m shocked.\u201d\nObviously, Merlin ignores his scathe and watches the young boy with a pained expression. \n\u201cI really just came to speak with Iseldir. Is he here?\u201d\n\u201cYes, my lord,\u201d the boy says with another bow. \u201cI would be honoured to escort you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not your Lord. Just\u2026 just call me Merlin.\u201d The boy looks terrified at the mere thought and Arthur has to supress a chuckle. \u201cAnd I wondered if it was possible to get into camp with as little fuss as possible?\u201d Merlin asks hopefully. \u201cIt\u2019s a\u2026 sensitive mission.\u201d\n\u201cOf course my-... I mean Merlin. Emrys. Sir.\u201d\nThe boy looks pained at himself for a moment before hurrying into the trees and gesturing for Merlin to follow. With a great sigh and a glance to the sky Merlin does. \n\u201cAre all men of magic bumbling?\u201d Arthur asks in amusement as they walk. He has watched the young man leading them almost walk into a tree twice in his efforts to look back over his shoulder at Merlin. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonder my father didn\u2019t have you all drowned.\u201d\nThey walk through the trees for just a short while before the foliage thins and opens into a small enclosed encampment. As with all Druid camps the area is modest, just a few tents occupy the clearing. Between them small fires, lines of washing and groups of people are scattered. \nMerlin stops just shy of the treeline, peering into the small camp with trepidation. \n\u201cRight,\u201d he sighs. \u201cJust point me in the right direction and I can take it from here.\u201d\n\u201cIseldir\u2019s tent is the red one in the corner of the camp,\u201d the young Druid says pointing out into the clearing. \nMerlin stares across the encampment with a look of unease that most knights reserve for a battlefield. Arthur cannot help but bark a laugh at his ridiculous servant. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a Druid camp Merlin, not Serket\u2019s nest. Get moving will you!\u201d\nAlmost as if he heard Arthur\u2019s reprimand Merlin takes a deep breath, squares his shoulders, and steps out of the treeline. \n-\nEven as Merlin tries to keep his head down Arthur watches as the eyes of everyone they pass stick to his manservant. People all over the camp pause what they are doing and stare as Merlin makes his way swiftly over to the red tent in the corner. \nApparently feeling the weight of all the eyes upon him Merlin hurries his steps, hunching his shoulders in even further. \nBy the time they reach the tent an old, wizened man has already emerged from within, standing at the tent entrance with a kind smile on his face. \n\u201cEmrys,\u201d he greets with a small bow. \u201cTo what do we owe the pleasure?\u201d\n\u201cI came to request your assistance,\u201d Merlin says quietly. \u201cIf I may?\u201d\n\u201cOf course, you may Emrys. We are here but to serve you.\u201d\nWith that the old man, which Arthur determines must be Iseldir, pulls open the flap of his tent and gestures for Merlin to enter. \nInside the tent flap closes and the inner space is plunged into silence, almost as if by magic Arthur muses. He has never really had the opportunity to be openly nosey about a magic users home so he takes the opportunity to look around in interest for any evidence of sorcery. Only a few possessions littered around the space identify Iseldir as someone of import. Other than that the interior of the tent is very bare, even with its lived in feel. \nThe druid elder sits down on a small log within the space, gesturing for Merlin to take the other. \n\u201cIt\u2019s Arthur. The King,\u201d Merlin starts with no preamble. \u201cThere was\u2026 an incident. I have reason to believe druidic magic was involved.\u201d\nWhen Iseldir gestures for Merlin to expand he does, explaining to the Druid about the patrol and the chanting and the crystals. When he is done the elder is watching Merlin with a thoughtful frown. \n\u201cThere was an ancient druidic ritual,\u201d Iseldir explains. Both Merlin and Arthur lean further forward in anticipation. \u201cThe druids would tie a soul to a crystal. The practice was said to enhance clarity and mindfulness. It was designed to strip away earthly ties and allow one to \u2018see\u2019. But as always with such things some sought to turn the practice into a weapon. They would use the power from another\u2019s soul to increase their own power.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you think that is what has been done to Arthur?\u201d\n\u201cFrom what you explained yes. And the soul of the Once and Future King would offer the wielder quite a bit of power.\u201d\n\u201cSo, Arthur\u2019s soul\u2026\u201d Merlin says, worry evident in his tone. Arthur cannot help but share his servant\u2019s concern; one\u2019s soul being torn from their body does not sound like something you can come back from. \n\u201cDo not fear Emrys,\u201d Iseldir says kindly. \u201cIt is tied to this plane as long as his body is. They would have to destroy his body before his soul could be harvested.\u201d\n\u201cWhich explains the assassin,\u201d Arthur says to Merlin, seeing his face contort in thought. \n\u201cBut Emrys,\u201d Iseldir continues, \u201cthe druids banned the practice of such rituals many decades ago. If this is truly what has befallen the King, it was not the act of a true druid.\u201d\n\u201cBut someone aware of the ancient practices.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nMerlin nods, seemingly processing the information he has been given so far. Iseldir sits back and leaves him to his silence for a minute. \n\u201cAnd to reverse it?\u201d he asks eventually. \n\u201cThe easy way?\u201d At Merlin\u2019s nod Iseldir sighs. \u201cSimply crack the crystal. The soul will be freed and return to the body should it still be unharmed.\u201d\nMerlin visibly sags in relief at the news, sending a grin in Iseldir\u2019s direction. \n\u201cOk,\u201d he murmurs almost to himself. \u201cNow I just have to find the thing.\u201d\n\u201cCrystals with a soul tied to them hold immense magical power. Someone with such gifts as yourself should be able to scry for it easily.\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d Merlin says, scratching the back of his neck nervously. \u201cI\u2019ll try that then. Thank you for your time.\u201d\nHe stands and Iseldir does with him. \u201cIt is my pleasure Emrys,\u201d he says with a bow. \u201cWon\u2019t you stay for lunch? The camp would be thrilled to know you had come to visit.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I really must go. Back to Arthur and my destiny and all,\u201d Merlin says with an awkward wave of his hand. \nIseldir pulls back the tent opening and gestures for Merlin to go ahead of him. Merlin ducks under the fabric only to come to a stuttering stop outside. Arthur huffs at his useless servant and manoeuvres around his still body to see a crowd of people outside the elder\u2019s tent. \nIt looks as if the entirety of the Druidic camp has congregated and all stare expectedly and with wonder at Merlin\u2026 Arthur\u2019s useless servant. \n\u201cThey\u2019ve just come to say hello Emrys,\u201d Iseldir says kindly. \u201cNo need to look so nervous.\u201d\nAs Arthur looks back at Merlin he can see that the man\u2019s face has paled by a few degrees. He can\u2019t really blame him though. The stares of his people sometimes feel as they are weights. With every one of them he feels the burden of the kingdom and its future on his shoulders even more. Arthur still finds these shows of outward admiration from his people difficult to deal with and he has been training to deal with them since birth.\nMerlin has had no such training. But even as Arthur watches Merlin squares his shoulders and visibly swallows down his discomfort. He offers the gathered crowd a small smile and a nod of his head. \nFrom the depths of the crowd a small girl rushes forward. Her cherub face is streaked with dust beneath her thick mop of black curls, but she looks up at Merlin in happiness as she trips forward until she is stood at Merlin\u2019s feet.\nShe holds up a small pink flower to Merlin. \n\u201cIs this for me?\u201d Merlin asks kindly, kneeling before her to accept her gift. At the girl\u2019s nod Merlin smiles and twirls the flower between his fingers. \u201cThank you. But I don\u2019t really think it is my colour. I think it would look better on a beautiful girl like you.\u201d\nWithout a word Merlin leans forward and with a twist of his hand and a glow of his eyes transforms the single flower into a small garland. He places it on the girl\u2019s head reverently as if it were a crown and leans back. \n\u201cThere,\u201d he mutters, straightening it amongst her black curls. \u201cMuch better.\u201d\nThe girl beams and it is as if a damn has broken. Chatter breaks out amongst the druids and they all come forward, eager to place a hand on Merlin, shake his hand, touch his arm, offer him a word of greeting. \nAnyone who knew the man would be able to tell just how uncomfortable Merlin feels. Arthur takes great pleasure in watching his servant squirm under the attention that Arthur got used to at a young age. But there is no disguising the esteem in which Merlin is held amongst this crowd. \nThe men are all eager to lean forward and engage the man in conversation, the children scamper excitedly around the camp, the elders watch the scene with pleased eyes. \nAnd the women\u2026 well the maidens in the group huddle in packs, watching Merlin from underneath their eyelashes and whispering fiercely to each other\u2026 just like the women of court. Arthur shudders in sympathy. But either Merlin is just as oblivious to the world as Arthur had always assumed or he purposefully ignores them. \nEven as he watches Arthur wonders who exactly Merlin is to these people. He doesn\u2019t seem familiar with them to know the people personally, and not a single person within the group mentions Merlin\u2019s real name. Instead the murmurs of \u2018Emrys\u2019 echo through the camp, leaving Arthur to ponder the name once more. \nEven for someone untrained in diplomacy Merlin handles the gaggle relatively well, accepts a few favours that are pushed his way and bids the camp a fond farewell before heading back to Camelot. \n-\n\u201cSo how exactly do you \u2018scry\u2019?\u201d Arthur asks Merlin as they jog up the stone steps into the castle that afternoon. \u201cDo you need a spell? How long will it take to find the crystal? Will I come back to my body straight away? How accurate is it?\u201d \nArthur does not pause in his questions all the way up to Gaius\u2019 chambers. He cannot help it. Even when he believed magic to be the ultimate evil it had always been fascinating. He always wondered how it worked; how could you create something from nothing? Where did it come from? What made one sorcerer more powerful than another? \nGaius greets Merlin with a wry smile and a query about how his trip to the druids was. Merlin blushes fiercely and mutters something under his breath before retreating to Gaius\u2019 stores. Gaius chuckles under his breath and goes back to his reading, ignoring the racket Merlin is making in his store cupboard. \nArthur rolls his eyes and leaves his servant to it. He has been witness to Merlin\u2019s special form of chaotic organisation for enough years to know he doesn\u2019t want to see what his servant is up to in that cupboard. Instead he looks over Gaius\u2019 shoulder in interest wondering if the book he is reading is about magic or simply healing. \nMerlin\u2019s huff breaks his concentration and the man drops a large bowl into the centre of the table. The heavy pot makes a loud thud that makes even Arthur start. \n\u201cMerlin!\u201d Arthur complains loudly but Gaius has a lot more experience dealing with Merlin than Arthur and simply raises an eyebrow in question. \n\u201cIseldir said to scry for the crystal,\u201d Merlin explains. \n\u201cAlright\u2026\u201d Gaius says obviously waiting for the rest of the explanation. \nMerlin shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t know how.\u201d\nArthur groans dramatically and sends his servant a scathing look. \u201cMerlin! Isn\u2019t scrying in the sorcerer basic training? I should have known you would be as useless at this as you are everything else!\u201d\nGaius seems to communicate everything that Arthur has just said with another complicated move in his eyebrows. Merlin huffs. \n\u201cWhat?\u201d Merlin says, throwing his hands to the side. \u201cWhen was I supposed to learn? I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve noticed but there isn\u2019t a great abdundance of magical training available in Camelot. Everything I do is instinctual.\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d Gaius sighs, longsuffering. \u201cFill the bowl with water. I\u2019ll talk you through it.\u201d\nFrom where Arthur is standing, watching the whole process in interest, there seems to be a lot less ceremony and smoke in scrying than he had witnessed in all other magics throughout his life. But he can hardly claim to be an expert. In fact, the process is so dull that Arthur zones out while Merlin waves a dangling stone back and forth over a map of Albion. \nEventually Merlin\u2019s triumphant cry interrupts his blank stupor. \n\u201cYou found it?\u201d Arthur asks eagerly, quickly gathering over the map. \nGaius and Merlin are already crowded over the map, staring at the point where the crystal has dropped onto the paper. \n\u201cThat is in Cendred\u2019s kingdom,\u201d Gaius says warily. \nArthur shares the physician\u2019s caution as he looks at where the crystal has fallen. It is by no means at the heart of the kingdom, but the apparent location of his trapped soul is a little too close to his enemy\u2019s castle for Arthur\u2019s liking. \n\u201cLooks like it,\u201d Merlin sighs. \n\u201cHow can we be sure that Cendred isn\u2019t behind this?\u201d Gaius asks, looking up at Merlin with trepidation. \nMerlin is just staring at the map with a grim determination in his face. \u201cWe can\u2019t, but that is where Arthur\u2019s soul is.\u201d He straightens his shoulders and sends a forced manic grin at Gaius. \u201cLooks like I am taking a trip to Merenora.\u201d\nAs he starts backing away from the table towards his rooms Arthur catches up with what Merlin had said. \n\u201cYou are not going on your own!\u201d he exclaims, watching Merlin bound up the stairs to his room. \n\u201cYou cannot go alone Merlin,\u201d Gaius calls out. \n\u201cSee even Gaius agrees with me!\u201d Arthur huffs. \n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine Gaius,\u201d Merlin\u2019s muffled voice from his room calls out. \u201cI need to leave now before it is too late.\u201d\n\u201cBut you will have to travel through the Forest of Brecha and Ascetir,\u201d Gaius argues, studying the map. \u201cNot to mention that the crystal is likely to be guarded heavily.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I can fight better when there is no one there I have to hide from!\u201d Merlin calls back. \nThe entire situation is preposterous. A lone man, a servant, an untrained warrior none the less, cannot go into hostile territory on a mission to save the King. That is the entire point of the Knights! \n\u201cGaius you cannot just let him wander off into enemy territory alone!\u201d Arthur shouts at the physician. \nBut Gaius just sighs and goes back to his chair and book without further word. Merlin stumbles out of his room with his jacket on and a small pack hung over his shoulder. \n\u201cI\u2019ll be back as soon as I can!\u201d he shouts as he rushes through the chambers. Gaius sends him an exasperated look but doesn\u2019t move to stop him. \n\u201cGaius!\u201d Arthur shouts. \u201cHe\u2019s going to get himself killed!\u201d \nBut the physician doesn\u2019t move from the table, he simply turns a page in his book and carries on reading.\n\u201cAt least take Gwaine,\u201d Arthur is still arguing at a rush as he follows Merlin through the darkened castle. \u201cHe loves an excuse for an adventure. Or Percival! I\u2019d even settle for you taking Guinevere at this point.\u201d\nOf course, Merlin ignores him and distracts any passing guards with a highly unsubtle flaring of gold in his eyes. \n\u201cYou\u2019re going to get caught!\u201d Arthur hisses as Merlin causes a suit of armour to fall and darts past the preoccupied guard. \nThey turn into the main corridor. Merlin is almost running now and Arthur is jogging to keep up with Merlin\u2019s long strides. \n\u201cBoy!\u201d a harsh voice barks from behind them. Arthur lets out a heartfelt grown. \n\u201cGo away Bodin!\u201d Arthur growls walking shoulder to shoulder with his servant. \nThe footsteps behind them quicken as Lord Bodin hurries determinedly toward them. Merlin doesn\u2019t even pause. \n\u201cBoy!\u201d Lord Bodin calls again, rage filling his tone at being ignored. But still Merlin doesn\u2019t stop. \n\u201cCan\u2019t you turn him into a toad or something?\u201d Arthur asks as he jogs to keep up with Merlin. They turn into a smaller hallway with Bodin\u2019s steps close on their heels. \n\u201cStop!\u201d Lord Bodin calls again. \n\u201cJust bugger off Bodin!\u201d Arthur calls over his shoulder, keeping stride with his servant. \u201cI will deal with you when I\u2019m back.\u201d\nMerlin turns into a small doorway into a space that is almost black with darkness. As soon as they are through the doorway Merlin ducks, hiding himself in the shadows in a move so quick Arthur has to double check his servant hasn\u2019t simply disappeared. \nAs Arthur stands there Bodin storms forward, his eyes darting about in the darkness for his prey. It isn\u2019t until Bodin has stalked past Merlin\u2019s hiding place that the servant slowly emerges from the shadows. \n\u201cWhat can I help you with this time Bodin?\u201d Merlin\u2019s voice asks from the darkness. \nArthur cannot blame the Lord when he visibly starts but he rallies himself quickly, pulling his shoulders back and plastering a smug look of arrogance on his aged face. \n\u201cYou are out after curfew. You will follow me down to the dungeons until the Queen wakes and passes judgement.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a kind offer My Lord but I am afraid I will have to decline. Perhaps another time.\u201d\nMerlin turns his back to Bodin to leave and the Lord darts forward. Arthur has a flash back of the Lord\u2019s attack on his servant earlier that day but before he can shout in warning the Lord trips over nothing and ends up on his back on the floor. Arthur cannot help but laugh. \n\u201cCareful Bodin,\u201d Merlin is saying over his shoulder. \u201cIt is dangerous wandering about the castle in the dark.\u201d\nBodin scrabbles inelegantly to his feet. \u201cYou will come back here or I will call for the guards!\u201d \nMerlin swirls and Arthur takes a step back at the cold anger in his servant\u2019s face. Even Lord Bodin staggers back a few steps. Looking at Merlin now there is no way you could ever mistake him for a mere servant. There is something harsh and otherworldly about him as he takes a step forward towards Bodin who sensibly takes a step backwards. \n\u201cI do not have time for your particular brand of disapproval right now Lord Bodin. I have things to do. Stay here and do not follow me.\u201d \nMerlin\u2019s eyes swirl gold and the wooden door swings shut in the doorway. Arthur distantly hears the muffled thud of Bodin\u2019s body hitting the door and his shouts for help as they disappear into the castle. \n-\n\u201cThomas,\u201d Merlin greets as he rushes into the royal stables. The young boy Arthur remembers from his first morning in this state (was that really only 3 days ago? It feels like a lifetime ago for Arthur now) startles up from his sleeping at Merlin\u2019s abrupt arrival. \n\u201cI\u2019m taking my horse,\u201d Merlin calls as he throws a saddle over his mare. \u201cI\u2019ll be gone for a day or so. Send word to Gwaine for me would you?\u201d \nThomas barely has time to formulate a response before Merlin\u2019s horse is saddled and he is swinging himself up onto her back. Before Arthur can even think of course of action Merlin is starting to ride away and Arthur just reacts. He runs forward, placing two hands on the back of the horse and jumps. He just about manages to secure himself on the back of the horse before Merlin breaks out into a gallop. \n-\nWhen the sun sets in earnest and the forest is plunged into darkness Arthur expects Merlin to stop. But they don\u2019t. They ride all through the night, not pausing or letting up pace once. The horse should have tired but Arthur is quite sure that something of Merlin\u2019s magic is keeping them going. \nAs the sun rises it brings with it rain. Arthur cannot feel it but from his seat Arthur can see the rain dripping from the ends of Merlin\u2019s sodden hair and can see it in the soaked fabric of the man\u2019s jacket. But still they do not pause. \nOnwards they gallop through the rest of the day. They pass over the boarder at some point after midday, the only sign that they are now in Escetir is a small stone plinth marking the division between the two Kingdoms. \nThey are in the Forest of Merenora before Merlin eases up his pace. They slow to a trot as they wind through the thickening trees. Again, they do not stick to any paths. Arthur assumes Merlin uses his magic to guide him as they continue forward. \nThe stronghold is near invisible and very well placed amongst the thick trees and bordered by the tall stone face of a gorge on one side. It is clearly the ruins of an old castle or keep. Little remains of the stone structure other than a few internal walls and an impressive archway that spans from the stone face of the gorge overhead to a pillar. \nThere at the entrance two mercenaries stand on guard dressed in the same simple black tunic that his assassin had been in. Arthur almost scoffs. If you want to keep your secret hiding place in a castle\u2019s ruins secret don\u2019t post two uniformed guards at the entrance. \nArthur is sure Merlin is using some kind of magic to dampen their sound as the men don\u2019t even turn at the crunching of the horse\u2019s hooves in the leaves. As silent as the night Merlin slides from the saddle and creeps forward, crouching low amongst the bushes for cover. \nBoth Merlin and Arthur survey the ground below them. The castle is slightly lower than their vantage point. That gives them the advantage, Arthur muses. \n\u201cIf you approach from that direction,\u201d Arthur says pointing to the left where the bank they are on meets the gorge, \u201cthen you will have the advantage of the higher ground, and they won\u2019t be able to outflank you. If you focus on disarming them first-\u201d\nBut Arthur doesn\u2019t get to finish before Merlin has stood and marches purposefully and swiftly right at the two guards. \nThe men see Merlin\u2019s approach (how could they not) and draw their swords simultaneously but before either man can form a shout of warning for anyone inside the ruins their eyes roll back in their heads and they crumple to the ground like cut puppets. \n\u201cOr that would do it,\u201d Arthur murmurs in shock.\nMerlin pauses to look at the bodies as he passes. Arthur can clearly see the men\u2019s moving chests, proving they are not in fact dead, merely sleeping. Before Arthur can berate Merlin for his naivety for leaving two armed men unharmed at their only exit Merlin reaches down and plucks the men\u2019s swords from their pliant hands. With a whispered word the metal weapons disintegrate and blow away on the wind. \nMerlin brushes the ash from his hands and strides purposefully forward. Arthur can do little but follow. \n-\nAlthough the old castle is long gone the crumbling interior walls still rise tall to the sky around them. Between the gorge side and the surrounding trees, it casts a cool shadow over the interior of the ruins as Merlin and Arthur march forward. \nArthur is starting to wonder if those two mercenaries at the entrance were the only protection to his precious soul. He has a few moments to feel ridiculously put out by that before Merlin stills. Reflexively Arthur does too, listening for what might have made Merlin pause. \nIt is a few moments before Arthur can hear it too; the quiet murmuring of men talking. Merlin starts walking forward once more, even more cautious of his surroundings than he was before. \nHe pauses, his eyes flicking between the men before him and their surroundings, almost like a warrior would before a fight Arthur muses, before he just steps blithely forward. \n\u201cMerlin!\u201d Arthur hisses, trying to grab at his servant\u2019s arm but it is no use. \nThe men notice Merlin as soon as he comes into the ruined courtyard. \n\u201cHello,\u201d Merlin calls to the group, advancing with a sunny smile. The men in the courtyard jump to their weapons but don\u2019t draw them. They look at Merlin with a bemused confusion that Arthur feels he can absolutely sympathise with. \nArthur imagines how this might look to these trained warriors; a man, no armour or visible weapon, tattered clothing, no visible strength, calmly walking into a guarded castle and straight into their midst. They must think the man is a simpleton, or a distraction. \nSure enough the men\u2019s eyes flick from Merlin to the various entrances into the courtyard, searching within the darkness for an attack to come. Well let them think that, Arthur thinks. If they have one eye on their surroundings looking for an ambush it will be easier for Merlin to beat them. \n\u201cOh there is no one there,\u201d Merlin says with a wave of his hand. \u201cI\u2019m here alone.\u201d\nArthur wants to hit his head against something hard. \n\u201cWhat do you want boy?\u201d the man in the centre barks, his hand tightening on his sword. \n\u201cWhy do people keep calling me that,\u201d Merlin says with a huff, crossing his arms. \u201cI am very clearly a grown man.\u201d \n\u201cHe asked you a question,\u201d says a man to the left, menacingly. \n\u201cOh. I thought that were obvious. I want the soul of Arthur Pendragon. I heard it was here.\u201d\nA shocked pause stills the men in the courtyard as they look between each other. Surreptitiously, almost subconsciously, the man at the centre glances up and to the right; right up at a winding tower set at the corner of the ruins. Arthur almost crows with triumph. \n\u201cUp in the tower then,\u201d Merlin says with a nod, obviously also noticing the man\u2019s slip. \u201cI\u2019ll go look there then.\u201d \nHe takes a step forward in the direction of the tower only to pause when a sword swings in his path. \n\u201cYou foolish boy,\u201d the man sneers, advancing on Merlin menacingly. \u201cI could take you apart with a single blow.\u201d\n\u201cI could take you apart with less than that.\u201d\nThe joke is one for Arthur\u2019s ears alone who barks out a laugh remembering his first encounter with the plucky peasant in the lower town. Arthur remembers thinking that the young boy were brave, standing up to a prince like that, but absolutely foolhardy. Now with his new knowledge he looks upon that scrabbling fight in a new light, fond amusement colouring the memory and remembers all the inanimate objects that found their way into his way during that fight. He laughs again shaking his head; only Merlin. \nThe mercenary lunges forward and Merlin\u2019s eyes swirl gold. True to his word, without lifting a single finger he sends the brute of a man flying across the stone floor and into the solid wall. He hits it with a crunch falling uselessly to the floor. \nThe rest of the men look from their fallen comrade back to the pale man in servant\u2019s clothes now staring them with unshielded fury in his eyes. \nAlmost as one the men drop their swords and scurry from sight, disappearing through the gaps in the stone walls and away into the night. \n\u201cWell,\u201d Arthur sighs looking at the backs of the retreating men, \u201cthat was slightly anti-climactic.\u201d\n-\nThe tower is one of the only remaining structures of the old fortress. It spirals up into the sky and towers above the tree tops. Arthur follows as Merlin rushes upwards, taking the spiralled staircase two or three steps at a time. \nThe wooden door at the top of the tower is half open, emitting a glowing orange light of candles from within. Arthur opens his mouth to urge caution but Merlin charges through the door, heedless to any danger that may be within. \nThe sudden entry makes the room's sole occupant startle and turn. He is small of stature and certainly not a knight or warrior. His dark blue robes are tattered and worn but bear the same crest as the men downstairs. At first look the man narrows his eyes and takes a confrontational step forward. But something of recognition appears in his eyes and he pales, backing up a few steps. \n\u201cEmrys,\u201d he whispers with a mixture of fear and awe. \n\u201cSo you know who I am?\u201d Merlin asks taking a more cautious step into the circular room. \u201cThat will make this easier then. Who are you?\u201d \n\u201cTrayger my Lord.\u201d\n\u201cYou must know, what a mistake you have made attempting to harm the Once and Future King.\u201d\nMerlin walks forward like a hunter circling its prey; cautious but precise and determined. \n\u201cMy Lord, I didn\u2019t mean to offend. I only wish to see the same thing you do. To see magic welcome and our people free once more.\u201d\nMerlin huffs and Arthur cannot help but mirror his scepticism. A man who wants peace above all else does not send mercenaries to kill a King. He strives for peace with his every action. Just like Merlin does, Arthur muses as he watches his servant stalk forward towards the druid. \n\u201cIt is not your place to put such things in motion,\u201d Merlin says. \u201cIt is Arthur who is destined to bring magic back to the land. Not you. Not your mercenaries.\u201d \nTrayger\u2019s bland face twists in anger. \u201cMy mercenaries are loyal men who fight for a cause worth dying for. Tell me, what do you fight for Emrys?\u201d\n\u201cI fight for Arthur. And for the kingdom he is building. And the future he will bring.\u201d\n\u201cI have seen nothing that convinces me this man is the prophesised king! Even now he still persecutes magic users. Magic is still punishable by death!\u201d\n\u201cAnd how many magic users has Arthur executed since his coronation?\u201d Merlin spits. \nIt takes Arthur a moment to realise that he has not executed any. There have only been two arrests for sorcery since he became King; one was a simple farmer who escaped the cells before Arthur could consider his judgement and one was a small child. Arthur could never condone the execution of a child, so the family were simply banished. \nTrayger simply glares back at Merlin but doesn\u2019t answer. \n\u201cExactly,\u201d Merlin says triumphantly. \u201cHe is a good man and a good king.\u201d\n\u201cSays you,\u201d the man scoffs. \n\u201cYes. Says me. Now where is the King\u2019s crystal?\u201d\nTrayger stiffens. \u201cI will not let you do this Emrys. We could be free. Don\u2019t you want that?\u201d\n\u201cOf course I do. More than anything. But it will happen when the time is right. Now do not test me Trayger,\u201d Merlin says, his voice dark and dangerous. \u201cGive me back the King.\u201d \nMerlin steps forward and Trayger lifts his hands hastily. A string of unintelligible words spring from the man\u2019s lips and fire pours from his fingers, straight for Merlin. \nFear tightens at Arthur\u2019s heart but it is short lived. With barely a movement Merlin waves his hand and the fire dissipates into nothing. The look he sends Trayger is almost disappointed. \n\u201cYou will have to try harder than that if you want to best me with magic Trayger. Now where is Arthur?\u201d\n\u201cYou fool!\u201d Trayger spits sending another wave of magic in Merlin\u2019s direction. Again the servant brushes it aside with careless ease. \n\u201cThis is a fight you cannot win. I don\u2019t wish to hurt you. Tell me where Arthur is and I will let you walk from here unharmed.\u201d \nTrayger shifts. It is just a small movement to the right but Arthur notices it, so does Merlin who narrows his eyes at the chest against the far wall, the one the man has just moved in front of. \n\u201cMove,\u201d Merlin growls. \nThe man twists and Arthur sees it before Merlin does; the ruby hilt of a dagger being pulled from beneath his cloak. \n\u201cDagger!\u201d Arthur calls in warning, but it is too late. When Merlin advances the man throws another spell, but it is clearly a distraction. His other hand darts forward, expertly reaching beneath Merlin\u2019s outstretched arms and into his unprotected flank. \nThe sound Merlin makes when the dagger hits is not something Arthur ever wishes to hear again. The servant\u2019s eyes go wide and he chokes on air as the man withdraws the blade, eyes full of smug malice. \nMerlin\u2019s hands automatically go to his side, clutching at the wound and swaying slightly on the spot. Arthur is at his side in an instant, his own hands flittering uselessly over Merlin\u2019s clenched hands and the thick blood he can see leaking from between the thin fingers. \n\u201cI am unimpressed Emrys,\u201d Trayger says with smug satisfaction. \u201cYour magic may be no match for mine but you are still a man. You can be bested by men\u2019s weapons.\u201d \nTrayger darts forward again, braver and more determined than he has been before, but just as he reaches Merlin and Arthur braces himself to witness the final blow Merlin twists. He grabs the man\u2019s forearm and shoves forward. \nArthur is frozen as he hears the tell-tale sound of flesh squelching but when Merlin staggers back the dagger is not embedded into his stomach as Arthur had feared but protruding from Trayger\u2019s neck. \nThe man drops to the floor with a clatter of limbs. Merlin takes a deep breath, then another one, then Arthur can do nothing but watch on in horror as the strength leaves Merlin\u2019s legs and he too crumples to his knees. \n\u201cMerlin!\u201d Arthur cries, rushing forward hands outstretched. But there is nothing he can do. He\u2019s a ghost. Pointless. Useless. \nHis servant kneels in the centre of the room, his adversary beaten, his shoulder's bowed and breath heaving. Merlin presses a hand to his side, gasping at the pain the pressure brings. When he brings it away Arthur can see the thick dark red pattern of blood spreading across the man\u2019s tunic. \n\u201cCan you heal it?\u201d Arthur asks frantically, thrown by the amount of blood. \nMerlin just grits his jaw and presses his hand more firmly against the wound. With a grunt he pushes himself to standing. His face is pale with pain, and no doubt blood loss too, as he starts limping slowly over to the corner of the room\u2026 in the opposite direction of the exit. \n\u201cWhat are you doing!\u201d Arthur shouts as he sees Merlin all but collapse at the side of the wooden chest in the corner. \u201cStop foraging and heal yourself!\u201d \nWith a flash of Merlin\u2019s eyes the chest springs open and a brilliant white light escapes its confines. The crystal, Arthur realises with a jolt, Merlin\u2019s found it. \n\u201cArthur,\u201d his servant sighs in relief. He reaches a shaking hand into the depths of the chest and reverently cradles the glowing stone in his hand. \u201cThank the gods. Don\u2019t worry you will be home soon. Gwen is waiting for you.\u201d\nThe reality of the situation dawns on Arthur all at once as he sees Merlin raise the crystal to his face. \n\u201cMerlin. Don\u2019t!\u201d he barks at the man, kneeling down by the servant\u2019s side. Blood is leaking with gusto from beneath Merlin\u2019s clenched fingers and is already starting to pool on the floor by their knees. \u201cThat\u2019s an order! You need to be seen to. That wound\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt might take me a little while to get back myself,\u201d Merlin is saying with a gasp. \u201cI\u2019m sure you will be up and complaining by the time I do.\u201d \n\u201cMerlin do not break that crystal!\u201d Arthur is shouting now. He knows as soon as Merlin does Arthur will be torn from this place, sucked back into his body, and Merlin will be here, on his own, bleeding half to death. What if he gets back into his body and doesn\u2019t remember? What if no one knows where Merlin is? What if Merlin cannot heal himself? \n\u201cPut that thing down right now!\u201d he tries once more but Merlin has never been one to follow orders he could clearly hear, let alone ones he cannot. \nWith a grunt verging on a growl Merlin raises the crystal above his head. The last thing that Arthur remembers before a bright white light encompasses him is his last desperate shout to Merlin and the ringing sound of the crystal breaking.\nArthur is dreaming, he is sure. There is a bright light, someone calls his name, and there is fear; not for himself but for someone else. There is something he needs to do, someone he needs to save. But he cannot see through the thick white light that encompasses him. \nHe wakes sluggishly, groaning as he comes back to his aching body. His limbs feel heavy, as if he has laid in one position for too long. He groans again, shifting his legs and trying to lift his arms. \n\u201cArthur?\u201d a voice gasps near his head. \u201cArthur!\u201d it shouts again in excitement. Then there is a commotion next to his bed. Someone shouts for Gaius and there are more people calling his name. Really, can they not leave him alone to wake in his own time? He is the king for god\u2019s sake. \nHe slowly peels one eye open, blinking when he sees his wife\u2019s worried face hovering above his own. \n\u201cArthur?\u201d she asks again, a smile on her lips and tears in her eyes. \n\u201cI think so,\u201d Arthur grunts, trying to get his mind to catch up. \nThen she is squealing and throws herself forward, wrapping her arms around Arthur\u2019s body. Arthur tries to react and manages to lift one arm weakly to give her a pat on the back. \nAnd then his mind clears, and he sits bolt upright in bed. \n\u201cMerlin!\u201d he gasps. \u201cWhere\u2019s Merlin?\u201d he asks his wife frantically, already trying to untangle himself from his bed clothes. \n\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know,\u201d Guinevere answers with a confused frown. \u201cIt\u2019s late he is probably in bed. Arthur, please sit. You have been asleep for days.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t Guinevere. I need to find him. Get Gaius. And Leon.\u201d\n\u201cArthur, Leon is not here. You have been unconscious for days! Please just rest!\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t Guinevere. I will explain all later. Please. Just fetch Percival then. I need to get dressed.\u201d\nShe looks at him searchingly for a few moments before sighing in defeat. Gracing his hand with one last squeeze she rises and exits his bed chambers at a rush. \nArthur is quite glad he is alone in his chambers for when he first tries to stand his legs give way beneath him, sending him tumbling to the ground. Apparently many days spent in a magical sleep do not do much for lower body strength. \nWith a growl he pushes himself to standing, bracing himself on his bed post. He stays there for a moment, willing his legs to stop shaking and then pushes off for his wardrobe. \nBy the time Guinevere has returned, Gaius and Percival in tow, Arthur is dressed and has his chainmail pulled over his head. \n\u201cSire!\u201d Percival shouts in relief at seeing his sovereign up and standing. But there is no time for joyous reunions right now. \n\u201cPercival,\u201d Arthur says with a nod, tightening his sword belt with a harsh tug. \u201cReady a group of men. We ride for the Forest of Merenora immediately.\u201d \n-\nWhen Arthur has managed to dress himself, choked down the food Guinevere had forced upon him and withstood inspection from Gaius he arrives in the courtyard to see Percival, Gwaine and Elyan already sat upon their horses waiting. \nArthur\u2019s knights ask no questions as they set out into the night at speed, Arthur at the head. Without Merlin\u2019s magic to guide them Arthur is forced to stick to the paths and walkways, illuminated only by the moon yet still he and the knights ride on. \nWith each beat of horse hoof against the earth Arthur relives those final moments in his mind. The druid pulling the dagger. The dagger sinking into Merlin\u2019s side. Merlin\u2019s grunt of pain. Merlin falling to the ground. Merlin\u2019s blood-soaked fingers clenching at his side. His pale face, full of pain. The blood pooling on the floor. \nHe tries to consider how much time a man would have loosing blood at that rate but has to stop himself when the answer he gets makes him tense so much his horse almost bucks him. Merlin will be fine, he convinces himself. The man is the luckiest idiot to ever grace the earth. He has survived this long in a kingdom that persecutes magic. He seems powerful. He will heal himself and will be sat at the entrance to the ruins waiting for Arthur when he arrives. \nAs much as Arthur would wish to ride onwards they do not have Merlin\u2019s magic on their side and eventually that party has to stop just shy of the Escetir boarder. \nThey make camp in almost silence and Arthur wonders if his knights too feel the gapping hole of Merlin amongst their party. \n\u201cArthur,\u201d Percival says into the night. Arthur starts from his stare into the fire to see his knight staring at him eagerly across the flames. \u201cI have to ask you; do you know what happened to you? How are you healed? You\u2019ve been asleep for days.\u201d\nArthur opens his mouth to respond. And then promptly closes it again. How does he even begin to start explaining the rollercoaster he has been on these past few days. How does he explain that the simple fool of his manservant has been the key and the cure to his illness? And that that same manservant is right at this moment bleeding to death in some castle ruins. And that he knows this because he has been a ghost, wandering the halls of Camelot ever since his fall. \nHis thoughts are interrupted by a gentle thump and he looks up to see Elyan struggling with an armful of logs for the fire. \n\u201cElyan,\u201d Arthur barks at the knight causing him to fumble the pile of logs even further. \u201cI know for a fact Merlin told you to rest that shoulder. Put the logs down!\u201d\nThe knight does his bidding quickly but then he pauses, straightening up slowly. \n\u201cHow would you know that sire?\u201d he asks slowly, staring at Arthur with a frown. \n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cI mean I injured my shoulder after you had been attacked. When Merlin told me to take it easy you had already been unconscious a day.\u201d\nThe weight of the knights stares gets heavier as Elyan speaks and by the end Arthur can feel the impact of three sets of eyes on him. \n\u201cI haven\u2019t been\u2026 gone,\u201d Arthur says, shifting in his seat as he considers the best way to explain. \u201cI have been\u2026 around. But just not in a capacity that you all could see.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Percival asks, leaning forward. \n\u201cMy attackers separated my soul from my body and tied it to a crystal. My soul was free to roam the earth until its tie to my body was severed. Which thankfully it was not.\u201d\n\u201cSo, you\u2019ve been around, watching us this whole time?\u201d\n\u201cYou know, that thing on your throne,\u201d Gwaine says with a forced chuckle. \u201cI was just kidding around.\u201d\nArthur rolls his eyes at his knight. \u201cBelieve it or not Sir Gwaine I have better things to do than watch your antics.\u201d\n\u201cBut you had time to watch Merlin bandage my arm?\u201d Elyan asks with a small frown. It isn\u2019t accusatory, or critical but Arthur feels a slight embarrassment at the amount of time he spent following his servant around these past few days. \n\u201cYou\u2019ve been watching him,\u201d Gwaine says. It isn\u2019t a question, so Arthur doesn\u2019t answer. He stares his knight right back in the eyes and lets them give whatever answer the man is looking for. Gwaine\u2019s eyes widen slightly in alarm and his grip tightens on the hilt of his sword. \u201cWhat did you see?\u201d\nArthur considers his answer. It seems that Gwaine knows or at least suspects what it is that Arthur might have seen as he followed his servant around the castle. But Arthur has a strong feeling that the secret is not his to voice. Instead he matches his knight\u2019s stare. \n\u201cEnough,\u201d he murmurs with a small shrug. \n\u201cAnd now we are chasing him down into the night?\u201d Gwaine asks darkly, his hand not leaving his sword. Arthur feels an irrational stab of betrayal. \n\u201cThe idiot saved my life\u2026 multiple times,\u201d he huffs angrily. \u201cI do not reward loyalty and sacrifice with death.\u201d\n\u201cJust making sure we are on the same page Princess,\u201d Gwaine says, easing back. He still watches Arthur but his face breaks into grin. \n\u201cWhat now?\u201d Arthur grumps in annoyance. \n\u201cGods, I wish I knew what you had seen.\u201d Gwaine shakes his head, still smiling at Arthur. \u201cWhat was it like?\u201d\n\u201cIt was\u2026\u201d Arthur tries to think of a way to describe the feats he has seen Merlin accomplish; the healing, dissolving metal into ash, taming a dragon, besting a group of trained mercenaries, the tenacious energy he dedicated to saving Arthur, to bringing him back. He finds he cannot. \u201cIt was impressive.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Percival interrupts tentatively. \u201cBut what are you talking about?\u201d\nArthur starts, realising that the rest of his Knights are still there around the fireplace and looking between Arthur and Gwaine with confusion. \n\u201cIt is not my place to say. Just know that Merlin brought me back, and in doing so placed himself in grave danger. We will find him. We will save him. We will bring him home.\u201d\n-\nThe party comes to a skidding halt at the entrance to the ruins. Merlin\u2019s horse is still tethered in the trees and any hope Arthur had that Merlin had already made his way back to Camelot vanishes. \nArthur jumps from his horse, drawing his sword in one smooth movement. The ruins seem silent. Arthur pauses for a moment to listen but all seems quiet\u2026 a little too quiet. \nThe two mercenaries Merlin incapacitated are gone which tickles uneasily at the back of Arthur\u2019s mind, but he has no time for that now. He leads the men wordlessly into the ruins, retracing his and Merlin\u2019s steps. \nWhen they entire the ruined courtyard Arthur feels Percival and Elyan pause at his back, staring down at the dead mercenary on the stone floor. \n\u201cWhat happened here?\u201d Elyan asks at a whisper but Arthur pays them no mind.\n\u201cSire?\u201d Percival asks from the back but Arthur cannot pause. \n\u201cThis way,\u201d he calls, his eyes on the crumbling tower. \n-\nArthur dare not call out as he runs up the stone staircase to the tower. He tells himself it is to keep his approach stealth, but part of him realises it is fear of not hearing an answer that stills his tongue. \nThe wooden door at the top is still wide open from where Merlin had charged in, full of fury, bravery and determination. Arthur finds he cannot mirror his servant\u2019s stoicism. He slows to a walk as he approaches the door, fearing what he will find beyond it. \nHe can see the stationary boot of Trayger\u2019s dead body in the corner of the room but he pays the man no mind. It isn\u2019t until he gets to the open doorway that he sees him. \nThere, lying half propped up against the rough wooden wall is Merlin. \nArthur\u2019s breath catches in his throat on an inhale choking his lungs. His servant is just so still. Blood coats the side of his body thickly and his skin is as pale as moonlight. He lays slumped against the wall, his hands splayed on the ground as thickly covered in blood as his tunic. \nA sound behind Arthur is the only warning he gets before the body of Gwaine barrels past him, pushing him bodily from the doorway. The knight runs forward, sword discarded and skidding to his knees beside Merlin\u2019s body. \nThey are all talking now, his knights. They are asking questions. Elyan is inspecting Trayger\u2019s dead body. Percival is standing guard at the door shouting over his shoulder. Gwaine is hovering over Merlin\u2019s body. But Arthur cannot hear anything past the buzzing in his ears. \nThen Gwaine moves aside to look for the source of the blood and Arthur sees the steady rise and fall of Merlin\u2019s chest. \nHe barks out a relieved laugh. Only Merlin could be stabbed, left for dead and decide that it was a brilliant time and place to take a nap. In a spiteful act born of his fading terror Arthur kicks out a foot and jostles Merlin\u2019s leg. \n\u201cMerlin wake up!\u201d\n\u201cArgh!\u201d a startled yell escapes Merlin\u2019s lips as his eyes fly open. His wide blue eyes dart frantically around the room for a moment before they settle on the knight crouched before him. \u201cGwaine?\u201d he asks groggily. \n\u201cMerlin,\u201d Gwaine exclaims on a sigh, his head dropping in relief for a moment. \u201cYou do know how to scare a man don\u2019t you.\u201d\n\u201cArthur!\u201d Merlin cries with a smile when he spots Arthur. \u201cYou\u2019re awake!\u201d \n\u201cIt seems out princess was never really as absent as we imagined these past days. Apparently he\u2019s been following us around the castle like a perverted ghost the entire time. He knew you were here and injured and insisted on staging a daring rescue. I was the obvious choice to accompany him and these guys didn\u2019t want to miss out.\u201d\nThroughout Gwaine\u2019s babbling he had pulled Merlin to standing, dusting down his tunic in a surreptitious check for additional injuries. Arthur has no such desire to be that subtle.\n\u201cLet me see the wound,\u201d he orders coming forward. \nMerlin\u2019s eyes go wide as Arthur approaches and he back up a few steps. \n\u201cArthur, its fine really. It was just a scratch.\u201d\nArthur snorts. It was not a mere scratch. He saw the wound. He can see the blood. The fact that his servant is still alive is a miracle. \nNot willing to take Merlin\u2019s word for it Arthur reaches him and lifts the blood crusted tunic and pauses. Where a gaping wound should be there is a shallow cut. The pale skin around it is still covered in the remnants of the blood that had poured from it but it is old blood. The wound is small, half closed and shallow, almost as if it were inflicted many days ago. \nArthur gapes at the scratch for a moment before staring back up at Merlin with wide eyes. His servant just offers an embarrassed smile and shrugs. \n\u201cTold you it was just a scratch.\u201d \nThe fear and worry that had conquered Arthur\u2019s every thought and breath for the last day suddenly manifests itself in anger. He drops the tunic and storms away. \n\u201cArthur!\u201d he hears Merlin shout from behind him, but Arthur doesn\u2019t stop. He leaves the tower, jogging down the spiral staircase. The sound of armour-clad bodies moving tell him that everyone has followed. \nArthur knows his anger is uncalled for. And he knows it will be short lived. But so much as has happened to him in recent days. He just needs a moment alone in the trees to gather his thoughts and then he and Merlin will talk. At length. \nHe has only just walked through the crumbling archway to the forest when he hears a frantic shout from behind him - \u201cArthur get down!\u201d \u2013 and then a body is barrelling into him, sending him crashing heavily to the floor. \nThe tell-tale whistle of arrows sound in the air and Arthur realises belatedly that Merlin is laying on top of him, shielding his body with his own in the clear open grassland. With a growl Arthur twists, getting his servant\u2019s unarmoured body beneath his own and pulling them both quickly back behind the relative safety of the stone archway. \n\u201cYou idiot,\u201d he growls to his servant, almost throwing him backwards away from the oncoming arrows. Merlin looks back with his typical unhappy frown that manages to tell Arthur that he is both \u2018being a prat\u2019 and that Merlin is not sorry for tackling his sovereign to the ground. \nArthur huffs, turning away and peering around the stone into the forest beyond. The volley of arrows has stopped and an unnerving silence has descended on the clearing. There are perhaps only a few moments of silence before a cry sounds from within the trees and a hoard of men come hurtling forward, weapons of axes and swords held aloft. \n\u201cI knew that was too easy,\u201d Percival grouses even as he pulls his sword. The ringing of metal on metal tells Arthur that the rest of his knights have done the same. \nArthur has one moment to ask the heavens why it is always him that ends up in these situations before he draws his sword from his belt. \nAnd then they charge. \n-\nThere are too many. The small band of Camelot knights are outnumbered at least six to one. No amount of training and skill can overcome those odds. Even as they dispatch man after man still more pour from the tree line. \nArthur ducks a messy blow from a mercenary and slices across his chest, easily ending his life. He turns scoping out the tide of the battle only to see his idiot servant stood in the middle of the fight not doing anything. \n\u201cMerlin do something!\u201d\nAt the call of his name Merlin startles towards Arthur, his face merging into its usual frown of confusion. \nArthur huffs and wiggles his hands at the mercenaries in a manner that clearly conveys \u2019use your magic\u2019 but Merlin\u2019s frown just deepens. \n\u201cMerlin, did you or did you not miss the part when Gwaine explained I have been watching you for the past few days? I know your little secret. Now be useful for once in your life and do something!\u201d\nMerlin pales, and staggers back. \u201cWhat\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOh for gods sake,\u201d Arthur growls, dispatching an advancing man with a swing of his sword. He turns back to his servant. \u201cMagic Merlin. Your magic.\u201d\nArthur is slightly concerned by the pallor of Merlin\u2019s skin now which has gone nearly snow white. The man looks back at Arthur, eyes wide, breathing quickening and minutely tremoring. On Merlin it takes Arthur a stupid amount of time to realise the emotion he is seeing. To be fair, Arthur muses to himself, he doesn\u2019t think this is an emotion he has ever seen properly on his servant before. \nIt is fear. \nThat would be bad enough. But it is Arthur that Merlin is staring at in horror. It is Arthur he has just taken a stumbling step away from. It is fear of Arthur. \nAnd that just won\u2019t do. \nElyan pulls to Arthur\u2019s right, taking on the advancing men giving Arthur the time to turn to his servant properly. He claps a hand to Merlin\u2019s shoulder, feeling the tremble of fear in the man\u2019s slight frame. Arthur gives it what he hopes is a comforting squeeze and looks right into Merlin\u2019s eyes. \n\u201cI saw you dispatch the mercenaries on our way here,\u201d he says, his voice as gentle as he can make it amid a fight. \u201cI saw you call a dragon. I saw you kill the assassin sent for me. Now sort this mess so we can get back to Camelot and go home!\u201d\nHe stares at his servant, eyes wide, honest and beseeching. Merlin just stares back with an air of incomprehension. Slowly the instinctive terror fades a little and Arthur feels Merlin\u2019s shoulder straighten a little under his hand. \n\u201cWell,\u201d Merlin says, his voice croaky and his eyes suspiciously bright. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say so?\u201d\nMerlin gives Arthur one of his signature grins and Arthur cannot help but smile back. \nWith a deep breath Merlin turns towards the hoards of mercenaries still in battle with Arthur\u2019s knights. \n\u201cAlright, stop!\u201d \nMerlin\u2019s voice cries out across the clearing, bright and sharp and unnaturally loud. The knights all start, their hands going to their ears against the loud sound and everyone\u2026 stops\u2026 right where they stand.\nElyan is one of the first knights to recover from the ringing Arthur can still hear in his ears. The knight, eyes wide with wonder, takes a step closer to one of the stuck sell-swords, peering at where the mans leg disappears into the ground. It\u2019s as if his limbs have been sucked down into the ground. \nThe mercenary yells and swings his axe towards Elyan\u2019s head. The knight starts, stumbling backward away from the sharp weapon. \n\u201cSorry!\u201d Merlin calls and suddenly all the mercenary\u2019s weapons explode into ash in their hands. \nArthur turns to see the bright gold fading from Merlin\u2019s eyes once more. When he notices Arthur\u2019s gaze he hastily drops his arm and tucks it behind his back. Arthur shakes his head in exasperation. \n\u201cYou were so much better at this when you didn\u2019t have an audience.\u201d\nMerlin rolls his eyes. \u201cWell I\u2019m sorry sire if performing magics in front of the king of Camelot is a little disconcerting.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve watched you perform magics \u2013 very illegally I might add \u2013 for the past few days!\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were there, did I?!\u201d\n\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t. And when we get back to Camelot we are having a long talk about law breaking, talking dragons and about the fact you seem to be some kind of druidic king!\u201d\nMerlin winces and looks at Arthur sheepishly. \u201cYou saw that?\u201d\n\u201cYes I did,\u201d Arthur says with a huff. \u201cNow I know who to send to the druids as my emissary when I lift the ban on magic.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Merlin moans dramatically which just makes Arthur grin in victory. \n\u201cOh yes Merlin,\u201d he crows. \u201cWho else is better to be the messenger between me and druids but the mighty Emrys?\u201d\n\u201cBut they look at me funny!\u201d\nArthur can\u2019t help it. \nHis knights are looking at them both in a mixture of confusion and perplexation. The mercenaries around them are shouting and pulling at their legs trying to unstick them from the ground. And Merlin is standing there in the middle of it all, thick blood still drying on his tunic and his signature little scowl on his face. \nLaughter bubbles up in his throat and erupts from his mouth. He throws his head back letting the sound spill from his lips into the air. When he returns to himself the knights are all looking at him like he has lost his mind but he doesn\u2019t care. He looks at Merlin, whose face hasn\u2019t quite gained back its colour, and smiles. \n\u201cYou, my friend, have a lot of explaining to do.\u201d\nMerlin\u2019s face turns solemn and he gives Arthur a little nod. \u201cI do.\u201d\nArthur nods at that admission. They both know they have a conversation to be had. They both know what could be at stake. But right now they have other things to think about. Arthur looks around at the mercenaries still stuck fast in the ground, all straining against their encased legs\u2026 \n\u201cAre you going to leave them like that?\u201d \n\u201cProbably best for now,\u201d Merlin says thoughtfully. \u201cI can unstick them when we are well on our way back to Camelot.\u201d Then Merlin blinks and turns his gaze to Arthur hesitantly. \u201cI mean\u2026 am I going back to Camelot?\u201d\nGwaine has moved into Arthur\u2019s eyesight, his hand resting purposefully on the hilt of his sword; his eyes dark in warning. It takes Arthur a moment to realise what Merlin is asking but when he does he huffs and rolls his eyes. \n\u201cMerlin, I have spent the past few days watching you put yourself in harms way time and again to save me\u2026 to save Camelot. I came all the way out here to save you. I gave you permission to use your magic in battle. I just said I was planning to lift the ban. What do you think?\u201d\nThe smile that blooms on Merlin\u2019s face then is worth a thousand rescue missions. It is worth the worry and pain Arthur has endured over this whole ordeal. And it is worth the mountain of paperwork that awaits him if he wishes to overturn decades of puritanical legislation. \nArthur doesn\u2019t say any of that of course. Instead he sends Merlin a fond smile, rolls his eyes and slings an arm over his servant\u2019s shoulders. It's time to go home."
