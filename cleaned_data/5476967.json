    "text": "Harry sighed, his breath misting up the window which he was sat beside. \nIt was almost midnight, and the New Year\u2019s Eve party in the eighth year dorm was in full swing, with pounding music and loud laughter. Harry hadn\u2019t wanted to join his friends; they were all going as couples, and he hated feeling like a spare wheel. Not to mention that he also felt a bit jealous.\nAfter Voldemort, Harry and Ginny found that they just weren\u2019t suited to each other romantically any more, and Ginny was happy with Neville now. Following Ginny, Harry had started an angry, hate-snogging fuelled semi-relationship with Draco Malfoy after Harry came to terms with the fact that he was bisexual. Harry\u2019s fling with Draco failed, too, because Draco wanted sex but nothing more substantial, while Harry craved a bond or proper connection between them.\nSince then, Harry had been moping around. He had been acting so miserably that Luna had even bought him a book for Christmas entitled, \u2018Finding True Love\u2019, which had been written by a great-aunt of hers, who - ironically - never married. \nHarry had thanked Luna when he opened it in front of her, then rolled his eyes behind her back, but somehow he found himself flicking through it as his friends celebrated New Year\u2019s without him. Most of the book was pretty strange, citing which herbs would make someone smell attractive to potential lovers, or spells to stop a person\u2019s soulmate finding love until they met their \u2018destined\u2019.\nThere was one thing that Harry couldn\u2019t help but find intriguing, however - it was an incantation that claimed to show the reader who their soulmate was. \nThe clock was ticking ever closer to midnight, and as Harry heard the music dim and the laughter die down, he knew that the couples were getting ready to share a kiss as the clock chimed twelve. His stomach clenched uncomfortably, even though he knew he should be glad that his friends were happy. \nThere wasn\u2019t much to the incantation, and what harm would it do giving it a try? If it was nonsense, Harry would just have to make more of an effort in finding somebody, but if the spell ended up being true, at least he\u2019d know there was someone out there who could make him as happy as his friends were. \nThere was a minute to go until midnight, and Harry had made his mind up. Pulling out his wand, Harry pushed the window open and breathed in the fresh, cold air.\n\u201cSiroma murev ihim ad,\u201d Harry cast, not sure what to expect next. Perhaps an image of his soulmate would appear, or their name would become clear in Harry\u2019s mind. Or maybe the incantation was just bull and nothing at all would come of it.\nHarry could hear his friends counting down now, and he couldn\u2019t help but feel a stab of disappointment that nothing had happened.\nThere was eight seconds til midnight, and Harry wondered whether he should go down and show his face so that he didn\u2019t seem a complete misery.\nHarry took a step forwards with five seconds to go, and almost stumbled as a strange jolt shot through his stomach. He gasped, clutching his middle as his head felt fuzzy all of a sudden, leaving him only aware of his friends shouting the last few numbers in the countdown.\nAt the word \u2018one\u2019, the room started spinning, dragging Harry with it. He was lost in a blur of colours, and then he was falling - falling for hours, it seemed, though it was probably only seconds - until he landed roughly on something soft and warm.\nEverything had stopped spinning now, but Harry still had to bury his head in his hands as he tried to wait out the nausea and the headache that had come on.\nThen someone cleared their throat - someone very close by - and all sense of disorientation vanished as Harry realised just what he had landed on. He moved his hands away from his face and turned his head to apologise to the person whose lap he had landed on - and when he saw who it was, he quickly jumped away from him and drew his wand.\n\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Harry hissed, staring with wide eyes at Tom Riddle, of all people. \u201cYou\u2019re dead! You\u2019re supposed to be dead!\u201d\n\u201cStrange that,\u201d Tom murmured, his dark green eyes trailing up and down Harry\u2019s form. \u201cI was under the impression that I was very much alive.\u201d\n\u201cHow did you do it?\u201d Harry demanded, his wand shaking in his unsteady grip. He wasn\u2019t sure why he hadn\u2019t tried hexing Tom yet, but there was something strong urging him not to. \u201cWas there one we missed? How are you alive?\u201d\nThey had all been so sure that all the Horcruxes were destroyed, but there had to have been one that none of them knew about. Yet rather than the monstrous snake-like form of Voldemort, why had he been returned into the youthful form of Tom Riddle? He couldn\u2019t be older than twenty, still as devilishly handsome as he had been in the Pensieve memories.\n\u201cLiving is greatly possible if you haven\u2019t yet died,\u201d Tom drawled, finally drawing his own wand but not yet making a move to cast against Harry. \u201cIt\u2019s a pity; a boy somehow manages to break past all of my Wards to land in my very lap, yet he ends up insane. I had rather hoped you were intelligent.\u201d\nHarry\u2019s cheeks burned, despite his confusion. Tom was acting like he had never seen Harry before, but perhaps that was just a trick to try and lower Harry\u2019s guard.\n\u201cI\u2019m not insane,\u201d Harry insisted, his gaze not leaving Tom\u2019s face. \n\u201cYou\u2019ve given me no reason to believe otherwise,\u201d Tom stated plainly, and before Harry could even realise what was happening he had been disarmed, his wand flying straight into Tom\u2019s grip. \nNone of what was happening made any sense. Voldemort had always been creepily obsessed with Harry, and would never have missed a chance to humiliate or torture him. Even if Voldemort had regained his youthful looks, surely he wouldn\u2019t have regained his old personality and a tad more sanity. But then, how was Harry here with him?\nThen he remembered - the soulmate reveal incantation. But surely - surely - something had gone horrifically wrong with the spell; that it had become confused, perhaps by lingering traces of Tom\u2019s soul that had clung to Harry\u2019s.\nKnowing he was wandless and helpless, and with no way for things to get any worse, Harry finally drew his gaze away from Tom\u2019s face to study his surroundings. He was in a small study, with a wall lined with bookshelves, a red, velvet armchair, and a desk - and on that desk was a newspaper.\nTom still hadn\u2019t hexed Harry, so Harry had no qualms in running to the desk and grabbing the newspaper.\nThere was a photo of a much younger looking Dumbledore on the front cover - another dead man - and there in the corner was what Harry had been looking for. The newspaper slipped from his fingers and dropped back onto the desk as the date 31st December, 1945 swam in Harry\u2019s mind.\n\u201cIs that today\u2019s date?\u201d Harry asked softly, not looking back as he heard Tom approaching him.\nTom pressed up close behind Harry, one arm leaning past Harry\u2019s side to splay his hand across the newspaper. Harry had to shut his eyes for a moment, suddenly finding it hard to breathe.\n\u201cAs of five minutes ago, it was yesterday\u2019s,\u201d Tom answered, his nails drawing a sharp line down the newspaper-Dumbledore\u2019s face. \u201cWhat reason does a boy have for not knowing the date?\u201d\n\u201cMy name is Harry,\u201d Harry said through gritted teeth, \u201cand my business is my own.\u201d\n\u201cYour business became mine as soon as you broke through my Wards and landed in my lap,\u201d Tom retorted sharply, but his form softened behind Harry. \u201cI\u2019ve a spare room you can use; I doubt someone as confused as you has somewhere to go.\u201d\nHarry spun around, and immediately wished he hadn\u2019t; he was now trapped between the desk and Tom, with Tom\u2019s imposing height making Harry feel very small indeed. \n\u201cI,\u201d Harry started, swallowing to make sure he sounded confident. \u201cI don\u2019t need to stay here. I\u2019m going to find Dumbledore and he\u2019ll see me home.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no going home for someone in your situation, dear Harry,\u201d Tom said, one corner of his mouth lifting slightly.\n\u201cAnd what situation is that?\u201d Harry retorted, holding himself as tall as he could.\n\u201cYou tell me,\u201d Tom said, raising a brow and fixing Harry with a knowing look which had Harry tugging at his collar.\n\u201cBesides,\u201d Tom continued when Harry refused to answer him. \u201cThe man just defeated Grindelwald and thus has a lot of enemies. How do you propose to get close to him - wandless, might I add - without being admitted to an asylum for madness? You\u2019d be wise to stay here.\u201d\n\u201cWhy? So you can kill me?\u201d Harry mustered up the sharpest glare he could, but Tom didn\u2019t seem deterred.\n\u201cWherever would you get the idea that I\u2019m a killer?\u201d Tom enquired, sounding entirely innocent even though they both knew he was anything but. If it was 1946, then Tom had just turned nineteen, and had already murdered at least four people. \u201cHow about you stay with me, and if I deem you trustworthy enough I\u2019ll return your wand? In the meantime, you can get over your - what I\u2019m sure is only temporary - insanity, and then you can see Dumbledore if you still believe he can fix everything.\u201d\nHarry hated to admit that Tom had him trapped. Without a wand Harry would get nowhere, and he didn\u2019t even have money on him to buy a new one. And Harry could hardly just go waltzing into Hogwarts; if he broke in somehow he\u2019d just make himself seem untrustworthy.\nHarry knew full well that Tom had ulterior motives, but he was offering Harry board, and if was planning to kill Harry he\u2019d have probably done it already. Tom obviously had suspicions about Harry\u2019s time-travel issue, but he didn\u2019t know what Harry knew; that gave Harry a budding advantage.\nPerhaps staying in the past with Tom would give Harry a chance to stop him before he ever became Voldemort. \nSo Harry accepted Tom\u2019s offer of residence, and spent the rest of the night wide awake and trying not to think about what it meant that he had searched for his soulmate and ended up in the past with Tom Riddle. \n***\nLife in the 1940s wasn\u2019t all that different to the 1990s. \nPeople still bustled about in the streets, women chatted, and children played; couples sat in cafes, and Gringotts stood tall and gleaming - well maybe that part was different seeing as Harry hadn\u2019t broken in and escaped by dragon yet. Obviously fashions had changed, and the brooms and cauldrons were simpler, but Diagon Alley appeared to be otherwise timeless.\nTom had woken Harry in the morning and told him that he\u2019d have to accompany him to work at Borgin and Burkes. Though Harry wasn\u2019t thrilled about the prospect of spending the day in the dreary shop, it at least meant that Tom hadn\u2019t murdered Hepzibah Smith yet - he had quit his job only after killing her, which meant Tom only had two Horcruxes currently. \nNobody spared them a second glance as they turned into Knockturn Alley, the stigma of the place apparently not an issue in their current time period. It was strange considering how Grindelwald had been so very prominent, but perhaps Voldemort being so British-focused had led to the greater stigma growing later in time.\nTom stopped abruptly, prompting Harry to walk into him. \u201cStay close to me,\u201d Tom hissed. \u201cA pretty boy like you is gold dust to the hags down here.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you avoid them every day, then?\u201d Harry muttered bitterly, unamused at being called a \u2018pretty boy\u2019, until Tom smirked and he realised what he had just said. \u201cEr, I mean-\u201d\n\u201cJust don\u2019t stray, dear,\u201d Tom said firmly, putting a scowl on Harry\u2019s face.\nSomehow Tom made the word \u2018dear\u2019 endearing and patronising all at once. \nThe hags and the beggars did indeed leer at him as he followed Tom down Knockturn Alley, but they seemed to give Tom - and thus Harry - a wide berth. Indeed, the lowlifes of Knockturn Alley seemed more afraid of Tom than the innocent public who frequented Diagon Alley.\nA bell above the door of Borgin and Burkes chimed as Tom pushed the door open, and an old, short man with lank grey hair appeared. \n\u201cGood morning, Caractacus,\u201d Tom greeted, willfully ignoring the sharp glare that his employer was giving Harry.\n\u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d Caractacus wheezed, wiping dusty hands on his shirt. \u201cA friend of yours, Tom?\u201d\n\u201cA cousin of Alphard Black,\u201d Tom nodded. \u201cA bastard son of a mistress, you must understand, but his blood still stands.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d Caractacus murmured, his glare softening but his body still tense with suspicion. \u201cMy brother Herbert married one of yours. Would that make you Odin\u2019s half-brother, then?\u201d\n\u201cOrion\u2019s brother, yes,\u201d Harry corrected easily. \u201cI hear he\u2019s to be engaged to Walburga soon.\u201d\n\u201cForgive me,\u201d Caractacus simpered. \u201cI\u2019m an old man; names slip from my mind.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s to remain with me today,\u201d Tom said, his tone more demanding than any employees should ever be, but he seemed to hold the ability to get away with it. \u201cHe\u2019ll be no bother, Caractacus, I assure you.\u201d\nCaractacus seemed to consider that for a moment. \u201cJust don\u2019t touch anything, boy,\u201d he said with a nod. \u201cAll breakages will be paid for, regardless of the state of your health. I\u2019ll be in the office, Tom; watch the floor for me.\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Tom answered with a cool smile, his role as a dutiful employee played once more. When Caractacus retreated to his office, Tom gestured for Harry to join him behind the front desk. \u201cYou\u2019re aware of the Black Family Tree, I see. Was my portrayal of you as an illegitimate bastard far from the truth?\u201d\nHarry should know the Black Family Tree - he had spent a long time in Grimmauld Place staring at it, running his finger over the burnt out hole where Sirius\u2019s name had been.\n\u201cMy parents were married - to each other, that is,\u201d Harry answered curtly. \n\u201cDead or divorced?\u201d Tom pressed, picking up on Harry\u2019s use of the word \u2018were\u2019. Tom never missed anything, it seemed.\n\u201cDead,\u201d Harry said, the words \u2018because of you\u2019 on the tip of his tongue. His parents wouldn\u2019t have to die if Harry kept on Tom\u2019s good side, though, to give him a chance to defeat him early. \n\u201cAs are mine,\u201d Tom replied, and he and Tom had it in common that their fathers were dead because Tom had killed them. \nThe bell chimed as a customer entered, and Harry kept himself to himself as Tom talked animatedly with the customer. Tom was quite fascinating to watch, really, how at ease he made people - people other than Harry - feel comfortable around him, how he seemed to charm people, and make them do what he wanted - in this case buying a piece of jewellery which neither Tom nor the customer would handle without magic. \nThe shop was surprisingly busy, and while Tom flitted from customer to customer, Harry kept himself occupied with a quill and parchment he had found. \nLuna\u2019s great-aunt would be a young woman in this time, and she would hopefully be able to tell Harry more about the soulmate thing. The blurb had said that all spells and ideas were her own, which meant that there was a chance she might be able to undo it.\n\u2018Dear Ms Lovegood,\u2019 he wrote.\n\nI recently came across an incantation of yours which promised to reveal to me my soulmate. However, I ended up many years away from my own time, and with a supposed soulmate who I have no interest in romantically. What does a soulmate really mean, and can this be undone?\n\nHe knew he was revealing a lot, but judging from her book, Luna\u2019s great-aunt was as equally open-minded as Luna. He didn\u2019t sign his name, but knew the reply would be able to find him so long as she used the same owl.\nHarry glanced up as the bell above the door chimed again, and almost started at the sight of a large, red-headed woman walking through the door; a woman he had only seen in memories before - Hepzibah Smith.\n\u201cTom!\u201d she declared loudly, striding over to Tom and pulling him into a one-armed hug. Tom seemed to go with it, smiling down at the woman brightly.\n\u201cHepzibah, what a pleasant surprise,\u201d Tom said, sounding very much like a sweet boy visiting his beloved grandmother. \u201cThis day was beginning to drag until you appeared.\u201d\n\u201cOh, stop it, Tom,\u201d Hepzibah said fondly. \u201cYou\u2019ll make an old woman blush.\u201d\n\u201cOld? Hardly,\u201d Tom scoffed, and Hepzibah giggled.\nEven though he knew that Tom was only charming the woman so he could later kill her and steal her belongings, Harry still felt a strange surge of jealousy surge through him. His fingers clenched in response, so hard that the quill he was holding snapped in his grasp.\nTom and Hepzibah both looked towards him, and Harry smiled at them politely despite the pain in his hand.\n\u201cA work experience boy?\u201d Hepzibah queried.\n\u201cA friend of a friend,\u201d Tom answered. \u201cHe had a nasty head injury yesterday and I offered to keep an eye on him.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re very kind, Tom,\u201d Hepzibah said, clapping Tom on the shoulder.\nHarry rolled his eyes, brushing splintered bits of quill away from his palms.\n\u201cWell, I only popped in to say hello, Tom,\u201d Hepzibah continued. \u201cI\u2019ll be back tomorrow for a browse, but I must meet with my sister soon. Take this, and buy yourself something nice for your hard work.\u201d\nShe handed Tom over a sack of coins before heading off on her way to meet her sister.\nHepzibah was clearly a fool, drawn in by a smile and kind words, but she didn\u2019t deserve to die. Harry had looked her in the eyes now, and he wouldn\u2019t allow it to happen.\n***\n\u201cYou\u2019re to stay in your room tonight,\u201d Tom told him one night. \u201cI have friends coming over soon and I don\u2019t believe they\u2019ll appreciate your company.\u201d\nIt was like being with the Dursleys all over again. \nHarry had been living with Tom for three days now, but this was the first time he had done something that suggested he was something other than a young man who had a knack for retail work and customer service. Harry suspected these \u2018friends\u2019 of Tom\u2019s were actually part of the Knights of Walpurgis - the earliest form of Death Eaters.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t aware my presence was offensive, Tom,\u201d Harry commented. He\u2019d often found himself trying to mimic the way that Tom spoke to him, but Harry just didn\u2019t have the natural charisma to pull it off. \nTom\u2019s lips curled, and he hunched over to lean close to Harry\u2019s face. Harry hated how tall Tom was - Harry had finally grown to a respectable height that could be considered tall, but Tom still had about five or six inches on him. \n\u201cYou refuse to tell me your surname or your blood status, my dear,\u201d Tom purred, always one to out-charm Harry - not that it was hard. \u201cMy friends aren\u2019t particularly inclined towards Muggle-borns, and if they have any reason to suspect you are one\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not Muggle-born,\u201d Harry said. He could recognise a threat - or perhaps a warning - when he heard one, though. He doubted Tom would let them kill him - Tom would have done that himself by now if he wanted Harry dead - but he was sure that Tom\u2019s friends could torture him while Tom made it look like he was helpless to stop them. \n\u201cSurname?\u201d Tom pressed, but Harry just pressed his lips together and shook his head.\nThe name Harry was common enough for Tom to not think anything of it, but the name \u2018Potter\u2019 might be too risky to give away. Choosing a random family name would be no good either, in case Tom quizzed him on it; he obviously knew Harry wasn\u2019t part of the Black family considering he had many friends who actually were.\nThe fireplace flared green, and Tom gave Harry a pointed look as the Floo roared to life. Two men stepped out; one with long blond hair and pointed features, who must have been Lucius Malfoy\u2019s father; and a tall man with jet black hair and cool grey eyes which reminded Harry strongly of Sirius.\n\u201cAbraxas, Alphard,\u201d Tom greeted, opening his arms. \u201cThis is Harry, my current house guest. He\u2019ll be staying in his room tonight.\u201d\nAbraxas and Alphard shared a knowing look, and Abraxas smirked in a very Draco--like way. \nTom turned back to Harry, placing his hand on Harry\u2019s shoulder and giving him a light shove. \u201cTo your room, Harry, dear.\u201d\nHarry rolled his eyes but complied, feeling the gaze of all three men on his back as he retreated to his room. He was still wandless, and he\u2019d probably be better off away from Tom and his friends. He hated not having a wand; he felt so vulnerable and open to attack, and if Tom wasn\u2019t in a hurry to return his wand, Harry would have to go about getting a new one.\nThere were shops around Borgin and Burkes which Harry wondered about trying to get a job in. That way he could get some money to buy himself a new wand, and would also maybe give him an opportunity to spy on Tom without Tom realising. Though Tom was probably aware that Harry knew he was into the Dark Arts, he hadn\u2019t yet acted like a budding Dark Lord in front of him, and Harry couldn\u2019t stop what he couldn\u2019t see.\nHarry could hear more people coming through the Floo into Tom\u2019s home, and the sound of voices talking grew until it stopped suddenly - no doubt Tom had thrown up a Silencing charm. Suspecting Tom had also locked him in, Harry twisted the door handle and turned it, and indeed found himself unable to open the door.\nWith a sigh, Harry sunk down onto his bed, burying his face in his hands. \nThis was the right thing to do, he kept telling himself. Running to Dumbledore would make Harry\u2019s living situation a bit less precarious, and he might be able to get himself back to his own time, but then Harry would be throwing away an opportunity to save things before it was too late.\nHarry couldn\u2019t even begin to fathom Tom\u2019s reasoning for letting Harry live with him, but it presented Harry with a chance to stop Tom before he became Voldemort. Harry could watch Tom, stop him committing bad deeds, and even try to get close to him and gain his trust. Running away just because he wasn\u2019t comfortable with the situation would just allow history\u2019s deadly course to run again. \nAnd then there was the pesky soulmate business. As if on cue an owl appeared at the window, a letter clutched firmly between its beak. Harry hurried to the window before it could peck on it and potentially gain Tom\u2019s attention, and grabbed the letter from the bird.\nThe response was written in swirling, cursive writing, and Harry had to squint to try and decipher what it said. It read:\n\u2018How exciting! A time traveller! Soulmates are incredibly rare, and my spell was only meant to give you a glimpse of your soulmate, but the fact it brought you through time to yours must prove it truly is destiny! Give love a chance - you are here for a reason!\nHarry sighed, crumpling the letter between his fingers. \nSomehow, having someone actually confirm he was stuck in the past wasn\u2019t so bad as being told that he had defied the laws of time to be with his soulmate - his soulmate being the man who had murdered Harry\u2019s parents and became the most feared Dark Lord of all time. \nAdmittedly, Tom was a very attractive man, but that didn\u2019t change the fact that he was a sociopath who craved immortality no matter the cost, and would eventually end up psychotic and deranged. The problem was, though, that Harry wasn\u2019t living with the bloodthirsty Voldemort, but rather the charming, charismatic Tom who could be far too easy to fall in love with. \n***\nWhen Harry woke the following morning, he was instantly aware of another person in the room. He instinctively reached for his wand under his pillow, but of course it wasn\u2019t there.\n\u201cWhy are you so frightened?\u201d came Tom\u2019s voice, and Harry turned his head to see Tom sat in a chair in the corner of the room. \u201cWhat could you think was possibly in here with you that you had to fight without even thinking?\u201d\n\u201cYou,\u201d Harry answered honestly. Tom\u2019s eyes flashed over, and he gave Harry a sly smile.\n\u201cYou still don\u2019t trust me,\u201d Tom said - it wasn\u2019t a question.\n\u201cDo you trust me?\u201d Harry retorted. \u201cYou promised I\u2019d get my wand back when that happens.\u201d\n\u201cAnd how much faith, exactly, do you put in promises?\u201d Tom rose from the chair, crossing the room in two long strides and settling on the edge of the bed. He leaned forwards, supporting himself with his arm, with his hand only inches away from Harry\u2019s. \u201cIf you\u2019re wise it won\u2019t be much.\u201d\n\u201cI try to see the good in people,\u201d Harry said, suddenly aware of the way Tom\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple moved whenever he swallowed, and how there were specks of blue in the murky green of his eyes.\n\u201cIn everyone but me.\u201d Again, it wasn\u2019t a question.\nHow was Harry supposed to see the good in Tom when he knew what he would become? \n\u201cGive me a reason to see it,\u201d Harry said, not even sure if that side could exist in Tom. \nTom didn\u2019t reply straight away, but allowed his eyes to rake over Harry\u2019s body. \u201cIf you want to see it you\u2019ll have to look closer.\u201d\nHarry hastily drew his hand back to himself,their conversation turning far too flirtatious for him to handle.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to get a job,\u201d he announced, hurriedly changing the subject. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask around Knockturn, see what I can find.\u201d\nHarry\u2019s first stop was at The Coffin House. It was directly opposite Borgin and Burkes, and Harry was pleased to find that from inside he could make out the inside of the other store, even if his view was somewhat obscured by the shop displays.\nThe Coffin House itself sold items which mainly involved necromancy and tools for contacting the dead. Harry knew full well that necromancy couldn\u2019t raise the dead to be who they once were - though Inferi were proof that it was possibly to some degree - but in general, magic involving the deceased was some of the Darkest of all.\nSomeone cleared their throat behind Harry. \u201cMay I help you?\u201d\nHarry turned around and found himself face-to-face with a man who may as well have been a skeleton himself. He was all bones, with sunken cheekbones and thinning hair, and he was taller than even Tom. He didn\u2019t seem too old, maybe in his late thirties, but his clothes seemed even older than even the 1940\u2019s fashion, appearing somewhat Victorian. \n\u201cForgive my appearance,\u201d the man said, parting his lips and revealing two fangs in the process. \u201cI haven\u2019t drank for quite some time.\u201d\nA vampire working in a shop about death magic did make a lot of sense, admittedly, but Harry still wasn\u2019t sure how he felt about being confronted with a hungry vampire.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d the man continued, obviously sensing Harry\u2019s unease. \u201cIt would be a shame to kill a pretty boy like you, and if I started on you I wouldn\u2019t be able to stop. My name is Serafino.\u201d\nHe held out a bony hand, and Harry hesitated only for a split second before shaking it.\n\u201cBrave boy,\u201d Serafino purred, letting go of Harry\u2019s hand and moving his fingers up to Harry\u2019s forehead. \u201cWhat an intriguing scar; you\u2019ve been marked by death.\u201d\n\u201cI survived death,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI\u2019d like a job here.\u201d\nSerafino drew his hand back from Harry, and fixed Harry with a pointed look.\n\u201cYoung men don\u2019t walk into a store like this and ask vampires for a job,\u201d Serafino stated, running a nail over his lips and lapping up the blood that spilled from the cut. \u201cWhat are your motives?\u201d\n\u201cNothing that affects you,\u201d Harry answered, knowing pretending that he was simply a plucky graduate desperate for a job would fool nobody. \u201cI have experience with this kind of magic; I\u2019ve faced Inferi and Horcruxes, and I know the Hallows are real. I\u2019ve seen the Veil of Death and heard the voices from inside it.\u201d\n\u201cTalk like that will send you to an asylum, child,\u201d Serafino drawled, but he had a smile on his face. \u201cHow fortunate for you that I\u2019m just as insane enough to believe it, too. If I\u2019m to give you a job, I wish to know your name.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s Harry,\u201d he replied. \nSerafino went to the back office to retrieve some paperwork, and Harry chanced a look at Borgin and Burkes. Tom was with a customer, but he looked up and locked eyes with Harry; Harry could feel the intensity even from across the street.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a strange boy,\u201d Serafino said - Harry had never even heard him return. \u201cYou may know death, but that doesn\u2019t mean you know evil.\u201d\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI know evil.\u201d\n***\n\u201cI didn\u2019t take you for a necromancer,\u201d Tom commented upon their return to Tom\u2019s home.\nTom insisted on journeying to and from work with Harry, though he hadn\u2019t said a word until now.\n\u201cNobody\u2019s really a necromancer, though, are they?\u201d Harry corrected. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to raise the dead - all you can really do is bring their body back. Even the Resurrection Stone couldn\u2019t bring a completed soul back from the dead.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a believer in the Hallows?\u201d Tom asked, pushing Harry onto the sofa before taking a seat beside him. \nTom had seemed to have gotten more physical around Harry lately, using any excuse to touch him. \n\u201cWe live in a world of magic that would seem insane to some, so why should we let boundaries restrict what we believe in,\u201d Harry answered, wincing inwardly as he realised that he had just voiced Luna\u2019s mindset. \n\u201cBoundaries only restrict you if you let them, my dear,\u201d Tom purred, leaning closer to Harry until there was no room between them.\nHarry swallowed, the warmth radiating from Tom unexpected. But why should it be unexpected? Tom was still rather human at this point, his soul split but perhaps not irreparably. \n\u201cYou should be careful around the store owner,\u201d Tom pressed on. \u201cVampires should not be trusted.\u201d\n\u201cWould you miss me if he killed me, dear?\u201d Harry raised a brow, idly trailing his fingers down his neck. Tom\u2019s gaze followed the movement, and he licked his lips hungrily.\n\u201cIt would be a waste for you to meet your demise at the hands of such a creature,\u201d Tom said, and Harry froze when Tom\u2019s fingers ghosted over the edge of his face. \u201cI saw he was intrigued by that scar you bear. What curse is it from?\u201d\nHarry let out a gasp of shock as Tom\u2019s fingers traced the mark on his forehead and a wave of warm pleasure rushed through him in response. He had expected it to burn and sting like it did when Voldemort touched it, but instead it felt like every nerve ending in him was reacting with desire.\nEven Tom drew his hand back hastily, staring down at his fingers with a frown on his face. \u201cCurious,\u201d he muttered softly, mainly to himself. When he took his hand back to Harry\u2019s scar, he only allowed his fingers to hover above it. \u201cThe shape of it looks like the wand movement required for the Killing Curse.\u201d\nHarry hoped Tom didn\u2019t notice his sharp intake of breath. \u201cNobody can survive that, yet here I am.\u201d\n\u201cNobody was supposed to be able to break through my Wards, yet here you are,\u201d Tom pointed out, his eyes wide and unblinking as he stared at Harry. \u201cBoundaries of magic are meant to be broken by those deserving of it.\u201d\n\u201cAnd boundaries of death?\u201d Harry asked, knowing he was maybe pushing this a bit too far. \nTom paused for a moment, and Harry had to avert his gaze from the intense look Tom was giving him. \u201cThere are ways to defeat death,\u201d Tom stated, \u201cbut only by those willing to break life in the process.\u201d\n\u201cHow?\u201d Harry pressed, knowing he had finally gone too far when Tom stood abruptly.\n\u201cYour mind wouldn\u2019t be able to handle the brutality of it,\u201d Tom hissed, his eyes flashing over red for a moment. \u201cBut as you said, you try to see the good in everyone so perhaps nobody is truly capable of it - that is, if you believe truly everybody has good to them.\u201d\n\u201cI believe everyone has the potential to have good in them,\u201d Harry corrected firmly, standing as well. He had, after all, even offered Voldemort a chance to try for remorse in the end, and if he could allow Voldemort that opportunity then he could offer it to Tom as well.\n\u201cGood is hard to define,\u201d Tom said, tilting his head. \u201cSome do things they believe to be good but others view as bad. Life isn\u2019t something that can be split into good and bad.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s only the powerful and the weak,\u201d Harry finished, paraphrasing some of the first words Voldemort had ever said to him.\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d Tom nodded. \u201cAnd I, dearest Harry, intend to be powerful.\u201d\n***\nSomehow, Harry found himself settling into an easy routine.\nHe would wake up in a morning, usually with Tom watching him, and though he still found it a bit creepy he had got used to it now. They would walk to work together, talking idly on their way. Tom hadn\u2019t let anything slip about his Darker side since that night where Tom had almost lost his collected demeanor, and he easily changed the subject any time Harry tried to dig.\nSometimes Tom would have friends over, and Harry would be locked in his room, unable to hear anything that was going on. They always left him alone, though, and he pretended like they weren\u2019t there.\nSerafino, meanwhile had practically become a different person, having found a way to indulge his thirst. Harry didn\u2019t want to know how, but Serafino was no longer skeletal, and now his pale skin and silver eyes seemed to glow. \nHarry didn\u2019t even know why Serafino had hired him, because most work days consisted of sitting around and studying the displays, and warning occasional customers that The Coffin House wouldn\u2019t be help liable in case of demonic possession or death. Harry reckoned that Serafino just liked his company.\nAnd while Harry had little to do, he would look across the street into Borgin and Burkes, watching Tom as he played the role of shop assistant incredibly well. Hepzibah Smith seemed to come into the shop almost every day, usually with a gift for Tom. She seemed to be very taken by him, which would ultimately lead to her demise unless Harry could save her. \nUnknown to Tom, Harry had bought himself a wand with his first paycheck. It wasn\u2019t as good as his own, but it did the job and made him feel a lot safer and prepared. So when he saw Hepzibah leaving late one afternoon from Borgin and Burkes, laden with bags, Harry shouted to Serafino that he was taking a lunch break and hurried after her.\nA well aimed jinx tore through one of her bags, spilling all her goods to the ground. \n\u201cOh!\u201d Harry exclaimed, hurrying over to her under the guise of trying to help. \u201cLet me get that for you.\u201d\nHe waved his wand, bringing the spilled goods slowly into the air and guiding them into one of the other bags.\n\u201cYou,\u201d Hepzibah said. \u201cYou\u2019re Tom\u2019s friend, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Harry replied with a nod. \u201cActually, I was hoping I\u2019d run into you. I, er, need to talk to you about Tom.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Hepzibah questioned sharply. \u201cIs he alright? Is he in any kind of trouble?\u201d\n\u201cSort of, yes,\u201d Harry said. \u201cLook, can we talk somewhere private?\u201d\nHepzibah shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere with you; you can tell me what\u2019s wrong with Tom right now or I\u2019m leaving.\u201d\nHarry paused, unsure quite how to tell Hepzibah to watch herself without making himself sound paranoid or deranged. He didn\u2019t want to freak Hepzibah out, but rather just have her aware that Tom wasn\u2019t what he seemed.\n\u201cTom is,\u201d Harry started, frowning as he thought how to finish his sentence. \u201cTom is, er, after your artefacts. Burke likes to make a good deal and he knows how much your stuff is worth, so he\u2019s ordered Tom to try and charm you so you sell far cheaper than you should.\u201d\nHepzibah stared at him for a moment, and Harry remembered how in the memory there was a split-second where she saw the greed on Tom\u2019s face and the red in his eyes and doubted him because of it. But then a scowl crossed her face, and she slapped Harry\u2019s arm hard.\n\u201cLiar!\u201d she hissed, lowering her voice when several people looked their way. \u201cTom is a kind, thoughtful young man. That poor boy\u2019s an orphan, you know, and he\u2019s told me I\u2019m like the grandmother he always wanted. How dare you make up such filth about him!\u201d\n\u201cHepzibah,\u201d Harry tried, but the woman cut him off with a snarl.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Ms Smith to you!\u201d\n\u201cHepzibah?\u201d came Tom\u2019s voice, and Harry wanted to vanish there and then. \u201cIs everything alright?\u201d\n\u201cNo, no it\u2019s not,\u201d she answered hotly. \u201cThis boy\u2019s trying to spread lies about you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m really not,\u201d Harry protested, wincing when Hepzibah slapped his arm again.\n\u201cLiar!\u201d she hissed again. \u201cHe said you were a conman, manipulating me, he said.\u201d\n\u201cHepzibah,\u201d Tom said gently. \u201cI\u2019m not manipulating you, you know that. But like I told you before, Harry suffered a head injury and he tends to be somewhat delusional at times. He doesn\u2019t mean any harm by it.\u201d\nTom sent Harry a sharp glare over Hepzibah\u2019s head as she turned to clap Tom\u2019s shoulder gently.\n\u201cHow good of you to take care of such a boy,\u201d she said. \u201cIf he\u2019d been in my life he\u2019d have been locked in an asylum.\u201d\n\u201cHe just needs a bit of patience,\u201d Tom replied, stepping away from Hepzibah to stand by Harry. He threw an arm around Harry\u2019s shoulders, the grip of his hand too hard for it to just be a friendly gesture. \u201cI shall see you tomorrow, Hepzibah.\u201d\nWith that said, Tom steered Harry down one of the side-streets, taking them away from the main Alley until Harry finally managed to shrug Tom off.\n\u201cLet\u2019s not play games, Tom,\u201d Harry said furiously. \u201cWe both know you\u2019re not a nice man, and Hepzibah deserves to know that you don\u2019t have her best interest at heart.\u201d\n\u201cSo what if I don\u2019t?\u201d Tom retorted, stepping closer to Harry until Harry was trapped between Tom and the wall of the building. \u201cI keep a lonely old woman happy and in return I get what I want. Why does Hepzibah matter to you so much?\u201d\nIt was true that if Tom didn\u2019t kill Hepzibah he could easily find another customer with precious heirlooms to target, but history had a spotlight on Hepzibah. Harry was also coming to terms with the fact it wasn\u2019t just Hepzibah he was trying to save, but Tom as well.\nTom had created two Horcruxes already, but he was still relatively normal and human. But after the murder of Hepzibah, Tom vanished and travelled the world, sinking deeper into the Dark Arts until he returned on the brink of becoming a monster. Hepzibah was the catalyst which would turn Tom into Voldemort.\nHe could handle Tom as his soulmate, Harry realised, but not Voldemort. He didn\u2019t have to defeat Tom himself, but just the path that would lead him to becoming Voldemort.\n\u201cHepzibah doesn\u2019t matter to me,\u201d Harry said, because that was all he could really say; it wasn\u2019t like he could tell Tom the truth.\nTom\u2019s hand reached for Harry\u2019s chest, spreading his fingers across him. Tom\u2019s hand was warm and heavy, reassuring somehow, but with an ache for more. Harry wanted more; he wanted Tom\u2019s warmth and his touches, and he wanted Tom to stay Tom.\n\u201cYou\u2019re very odd, Harry,\u201d Tom said gently, though there was a fire in his eyes. \u201cYou infuriate yet intrigue me. You\u2019re naive and foolish yet somehow you seem to be more aware than anyone. You know me, while I know so little about you. You\u2019re an enigma, my dear, but I\u2019ve always been gifted when it comes to solving puzzles.\u201d\n\u201cLet me know once you solve me,\u201d Harry breathed. \u201cI still haven\u2019t figured it out.\u201d\n***\nHarry sat in the middle of the sitting room floor in Tom\u2019s home, his fingers hovering over a thick board which was covered with various rune markings. It looked like - and basically was - the wizarding version of a Ouija Board, but there were no letters on it.\nRather than contacting the Realm of the Dead which could potentially allow dangerous spirits through, the board simply allowed nearby spirits enough power to reveal themselves for a short period of time. It was incredibly Dark magic, Serafino had said, but could allow people contact with any spirits that were lurking around them.\nThe boards were sold as display only because it was illegal to actually use one, but Serafino swore the Ministry wouldn\u2019t be able to trace usage. He had emphasised that after asking Harry if he would have a go at using it. Serafino had been a bit shady about it, though he claimed he just wanted Harry to experience what it was like, but Harry couldn\u2019t see any reason for an ulterior motive.\nDoing as Serafino had instructed him, Harry ran his fingers over the runes in a precise order, before tapping the middle of the board with his wand.\nAt first, it seemed like nothing was happening, but then Harry felt the temperature in the room get considerably colder. Harry glanced around but saw nothing, and slowly got to his feet.\nAs he stood, Harry caught sight of himself in the large mirror that Tom kept on the wall. Harry wasn\u2019t alone.\nHe turned around quickly, wand drawn, but the girl standing there didn\u2019t flinch. Instead she smiled sadly at him, her face flickering every so often.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do me any more harm than they already did,\u201d she said, her voice distant yet somehow able to reach Harry\u2019s very core.\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much pain,\u201d a new voice said, and Harry spun around to see an old man clutching his head. \u201cWhat did I do to them to deserve this?\u201d\n\u201cFilth. Filth. That\u2019s what they called me,\u201d came the voice of yet another new spirit.\n\u201cWanted to see my dirty blood,\u201d hissed another, this one covered in blood. \u201cMud, they said. Undeserving.\u201d\nHarry didn\u2019t know where to look next, as more and more spirits appeared in the room. There were men and women, old and young, but all of them looked sad, and none of them lingered long enough to say much. They were all saying the same things, though, referencing pain and fear. None of the spirits said \u2018he\u2019, though, always \u2018they\u2019.\nIt wasn\u2019t like Harry was an idiot; he knew that when Tom had friends over they wouldn\u2019t idly sit around chatting, playing board games and drinking beer. Harry knew that they weren\u2019t really Tom\u2019s friends, but the Knights of Walpurgis, and he knew that they killed people.\nIt was just that seeing their victims, so many of them, drove a stake of fear into Harry\u2019s heart. What if Tom was too late to be saved? Because knowing was one thing, but seeing was another. All these people were dead because of Tom and his cause, but somehow Harry still wanted to save him.\nIn some ways, that made Harry worse than Tom. \nThe board was beginning to shake, the runes lighting up and flashing in sporadic patterns. The air felt thick and heavy with magic, the Darkness of it sinking through Harry\u2019s skin and making him feel alive. Though Harry had used Dark magic before, it had been nothing like this. The closest he had come was when he had cast the Cruciatus Curse on Amycus Carrow.\nThe magic seemed to spark suddenly, and Harry knew that Tom was home.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Tom asked sharply, and when Harry turned to look at him he saw that Tom was surrounded by the spirits of the people he watched die.\nTom didn\u2019t seem to be able to see them, but he could obviously feel the Dark magic in the air. His eyes were wide, a red glint to them, and he was watching Harry with a hungry look.\nHarry knew he should scream and shout at Tom, call him out for all the killing and the monstrous deeds. He should hex Tom and leave, and go the overt route by finding Dumbledore and asking for his help. Forget going undercover - there was no helping a monster like Tom.\nBut seeing Tom there, lost in Darkness and haunted by the dead, Harry realised that he didn\u2019t want to leave Tom. To leave Tom now wouldn\u2019t stop the killings, and it would only drive Tom to lose his humanity further. Tom was his soulmate, regardless if he was a killer or not - Harry had wanted to find his soulmate, so surely he had a duty to help him.\nTom was in front of him suddenly, while the spirits encircled them both. Tom\u2019s fingers reached for Harry\u2019s chin, tilting his head up and forcing Harry to look into Tom\u2019s eyes. Even with the red gleam, they were still human.\n\u201cStop this,\u201d Harry breathed, reaching his hands up to cup Tom\u2019s face. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t want you but I do. You\u2019re not a good man; you\u2019re bad, and full of sin.\u201d\nTom\u2019s lips curled, and he lowered his head until it was only inches away from Harry\u2019s.\nThe magic in the room seemed even heavier now, pulsing and leaving Harry\u2019s skin tingling. \n\u201cDon\u2019t fight it,\u201d Tom murmured, moving his hands to Harry\u2019s waist as Harry lifted up on his toes. \u201cSin with me. Be my sin.\u201d\nAnd then Tom\u2019s lips were on Harry\u2019s, and the world seemed to explode around them, leaving Harry only aware of Tom and nothing else. The spirits seemed to fade away as Tom pulled Harry closer, pressing their bodies firmly together.\nEvery inch of Harry felt like there was electricity coursing through him, making him more aware of his body then he had ever been before. He felt so alive, so warm, so complete, and behind that an ache, a desperation, for more.\nTom bit down on Harry\u2019s lower lip, tugging with his teeth before pulling away. Harry closed his eyes, resting his forehead against Tom\u2019s chest as Tom held him tightly.\nThere was too much to think about, too much confusion in Harry\u2019s head. The lines between right and wrong were blurred, but none of that mattered with Tom holding him, and for once, Harry needed to rest and forget the world.\nJust for a moment.\n***\nHarry sighed, resting his cheek on the clerk\u2019s desk as he watched Tom through the window. \nHis mind had been abuzz all night. Tom had left him not long after their kiss, saying he needed to \u2018think\u2019, and Harry had been stuck in a cycle of emotions ever since. He just couldn\u2019t decide if he was doing the right thing or not, or if there even was a right choice.\n\u201cDo you believe in soulmates?\u201d Harry asked Serafino as he came back into the store from running an errand. \n\u201cI believe they are rare,\u201d Serafino answered, tilting his head as he looked at Harry. \u201cI do believe they exist - but they are created, not born. Something that binds two people together in a particular way can confuse the soul, and make it part of one half rather than a whole.\u201d\nAttempted murder and accidental Horcrux making probably counted as a soul-confusing bond.\n\u201cWhat would you do if you had a soulmate?\u201d Harry queried, chancing another look at Tom who was talking to Hepzibah again. \u201cOnly you used to hate them, but then they died and you got taken to a time when they were still alive? Would you stop hating them just because they were your soulmate?\u201d\n\u201cThe Riddle boy is not easy to hate, despite his wickedness,\u201d Serafino purred, and Harry snapped his head up in shock.\n\u201cWhat? I\u2019m not-\u201d\n\u201cThat was a very specific question you asked me, Harry,\u201d Serafino interrupted, fixing Harry with an amused smile. \u201cI myself am not from this time; I died in 1792, and I\u2019ve learnt very well to mimic speech and behaviour from whatever the current time period is. As such, I can recognise when someone else doesn\u2019t follow those patterns. Also, you stare at Riddle far too much for it to be anything innocent.\u201d\nHarry felt his cheeks flush; he had been unaware how obvious he had been. Serafino had probably known these things about Harry right from the very beginning, and there was no point denying them.\n\u201cI can understand your concerns,\u201d Serafino pressed on. \u201cYou and I both know he\u2019s abusing the ability to create a Horcrux.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d Harry asked, surprised at how much Serafino actually seemed to know.\n\u201cThe same way I can tell if a person is a werewolf or Veela - his scent isn\u2019t entirely human. It\u2019s weak and fading, but without the bitter taste that another magical creature would have.\u201d Serafino paused, turning to look at Tom. \u201cHow did he die if he has Horcruxes?\u201d\n\u201cI destroyed them,\u201d Harry answered quietly. \u201cAnd then I became the Master of Death; when he tried to kill me his curse backfired and got him instead. He wasn\u2019t Tom at that point, though, he was called Voldemort. He had seven Horcruxes, and he was no longer human. He looked and acted like a monster, he was delusional and psychotic, and he was responsible for so much death and destruction.\u201d\n\u201cDid he give you the curse scar?\u201d Serafino asked.\nHarry nodded. \u201cThe first time he tried to kill me I was a baby. My mother sacrificed herself which gave me protection so his curse backfired but his Horcruxes allowed him to cling onto life. But as his soul was so weak, part of it latched onto me in desperation. He tried to kill me later on, though, which destroyed the Horcrux in me.\u201d\nSerafino\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cA human Horcrux? I\u2019ve never heard of such a thing happening; no wonder he\u2019s your soulmate - you were literally bound together.\u201d\n\u201cBut you see why it\u2019s not a good thing?\u201d Harry said. \u201cTom is going to kill a woman soon and make two more Horcruxes, before disappearing for years until he returns fully immersed in the Dark Arts, and obsessed with becoming immortal. I know he\u2019s a killer now, but he\u2019s still more-or-less human. I just don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\nHe looked at Tom and Hepzibah again, who were still chatting animatedly. \n\u201cI wanted to save her, or so I thought,\u201d Harry continued. \u201cBut I realised it\u2019s Tom I want to save. I\u2019ve told him I try to see the good in everyone, but I still can\u2019t see it with him. He\u2019s a killer, and I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything in him to save - I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worth trying. But at the same time, I can\u2019t make myself turn away from him either. Beside, he\u2019s never hurt me or raised his wand against me; I know there\u2019s been times I\u2019ve made him angry, but he\u2019s never been cruel to me.\u201d\nIt felt good to get all this off his chest, and regardless of whether or not Serafino could advise him on what to do, he at least had a bit more clarity now.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Serafino said slowly. \u201cYou don\u2019t necessarily have to love your soulmate to recognise your connection. And you say you came through time to be with him? So think - why would you be brought to the time before he becomes completely unsaveable? Maybe you\u2019re destined to save him.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know if I can!\u201d Harry cried, pressing his hands to his forehead. \u201cWhat if he kills Hepzibah no matter what I do?\u201d\n\u201cThen be with him afterwards,\u201d Serafino suggested, his tone strong and forceful. \u201cYou don\u2019t think Riddle has good in him? You\u2019re probably right. But you are good, and you are his soulmate. Perhaps the good in him isn\u2019t actually in him, but in you. Together you make a whole, and maybe you just being with him is enough to save him.\u201d\nJust to be with Tom, rather than actively trying to stop him killing, sounded difficult; but then again, maybe that was just part of Harry\u2019s \u2018saving people\u2019 thing. If it saved more people in the long run, maybe the sacrifice of standing by on some occasions was worth it.\n\u201cDo you have a soulmate?\u201d Harry couldn\u2019t stop himself from asking. \u201cIt\u2019s just, you seem to know a lot.\u201d\n\u201cI did,\u201d Serafino said sadly, and Harry instantly regretted asking. \u201cShe stood by me even after I became a vampire...I killed her by mistake when she tried to stop me draining a child. I\u2019ve never killed anyone since.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Harry breathed, moving round the counter to place his hand on Serafino\u2019s arm. \n\u201cShe saved me from being a monster, despite the fact I was designed to be a killer,\u201d Serafino said, giving Harry a sad smile. \u201cI believe there is hope for your Riddle boy.\u201d\n***\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Harry asked, watching with wide eyes as Tom pulled a long overcoat on above the sharp suit he was dressed in. The clothes looked eerily familiar, and Harry had a bad feeling that he knew exactly where they were from.\n\u201cTo visit a friend,\u201d Tom answered simply. \u201cDon\u2019t fret, dear; I shan\u2019t be long.\u201d\nHarry would fret all he wanted. This was - quite possibly - the day Harry had been dreading, and he was struck with a sudden awareness of how unprepared he was for this.\n\u201cDo you have to go?\u201d Harry tried, reaching out to touch Tom\u2019s wrists. \u201cI was hoping we could spend the night together.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s for work, Harry,\u201d Tom drawled. \u201cFeel free to wait up for my return.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Harry muttered bitterly. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m sure some of your customers must lie about their supposed valuables. In fact, the more valuable they say something is, the less it probably actually is. So just watch what you believe.\u201d\n\u201cI know my job well,\u201d Tom countered, raising a brow. \u201cAnd I know the authentic from the non-authentic. Don\u2019t worry your pretty little head about it, dear.\u201d\nPatronising sod. \n\u201cBesides,\u201d Tom continued. \u201cThe lady I\u2019m visiting is very trustworthy, and the items she\u2019s shown me are unmistakably real.\u201d\nHarry froze, staring at Tom with wide eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s already shown you them?\u201d he asked faintly, horror striking him as he realised he was too late.\nTom gave Harry a quizzical look. \u201cYes. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me\u2026\u201d\nHarry shouted, \u201cwait!\u201d but Tom Disapparated without another look at Harry.\nThe next two hours passed horrifically slowly for Harry. He tried calling Hepzibah on the Floo several times, but each time there had been no answer.\nHarry had briefly wondered about calling the authorities, but even if they believed Harry\u2019s claim despite lack of evidence, Tom would easily be able to flee. And if Tom fled, Harry would have no clue where he was, and Tom would just murder someone else to make his next Horcrux. No matter what, somebody was going to die, and at least Hepzibah\u2019s death gave Harry a chance to save more people in the future.\nHarry was so wrapped up in his thoughts that he didn\u2019t even notice Tom\u2019s return until he stood right in front of Harry. Tom\u2019s face was covered in blood, most of it concentrated around his mouth, yet he didn\u2019t seem to be injured himself.\n\u201cOh, Tom,\u201d Harry breathed. \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d\nTom said nothing, taking a seat beside Harry and staring at a random patch on the wall. The red gleam in his eyes was stronger than it had ever been, and even his face looked more pinched than usual.\nHarry stood, walking to the bathroom to run a piece of cloth under the tap. When he returned, he knelt on the floor in front of Tom, and wiped Tom\u2019s face with the wet cloth. The blood struggled to come off, the layer of if thicker than Harry had thought. Tom didn\u2019t flinch when Harry scrubbed too hard at his face, and even after Harry\u2019s best attempts, traces of blood still lingered on his lips and cheeks.\nHarry cupped Tom\u2019s face with fingers that were stained red. Tom seemed to stare right through him, not even moving when Harry pressed his lips gently against Tom\u2019s.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t make any more,\u201d Harry whispered, the silence suddenly oppressive, and too fragile for sound. \u201cLook what it\u2019s done to you; how much more do you think your soul can take?\u201d\nTom\u2019s eyes darkened, and his hand shot out to grab Harry\u2019s shirt, hauling him towards him.\n\u201cThe more I make, the more powerful I become,\u201d Tom hissed, resting his forehead against Harry\u2019s in a gesture too tender for the situation.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t trick death,\u201d Harry breathed, closing his eyes. \u201cHave you not heard the Tale of the Three Brothers? You might think you\u2019re thwarting death, but death will find a way.\u201d\nTom didn\u2019t reply, getting to his feet and pulling Harry with him.\n\u201cI\u2019m leaving for Crete,\u201d Tom said after a moment. \u201cWill you come with me?\u201d\nHarry nodded without even thinking about the question, and Tom grasped his hand. The Apparition Tom took them through seemed to last far longer than Harry was used to, and when they arrived somewhere in rural Crete, it took a while for the world to stop spinning.\nHarry looked around when he was able to, seeing sparkling blue waters on one side, and large, rugged mountains on the other. \n\u201cWhere are we?\u201d he asked, turning back to Tom to see a wand pointed at him. \u201cTom?\u201d\nTom\u2019s eyes looked mad, and the tip of his wand was glowing red.\n\u201cHow do you know all this about me?\u201d Tom demanded. \u201cYou appear in my life, knowing all my past deeds, what I\u2019ve done, and what I plan to do. You\u2019ve made no move to turn me in, yet my cruelty to others hurts you. Are you some kind of guardian spirit, or simply insane?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m tempted to say the latter,\u201d Harry admitted with a sigh, shrugging. Tom had asked him for the truth, though, and Harry would give him it - within reason; he wasn\u2019t sure how Tom would react to the soulmate situation.\n\u201cI\u2019m from another time,\u201d Harry said, watching Tom carefully but seeing no reaction. \u201cI\u2019m from a time where you created seven Horcruxes and lost your humanity and your sanity. You became delusional and psychotic, obsessive and deranged. Your quest for immortality became your downfall, because your Horcruxes were destroyed and your attempt to kill your biggest threat backfired and killed you instead. You died young, Tom; just over the age of seventy - trying to become immune from death ending up killing you at an age that than even most Muggles live past.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you returned to stop me before I get started,\u201d Tom guessed, but Harry shook his head.\n\u201cI considered going to Dumbledore,\u201d Harry confessed, \u201cbut we couldn\u2019t have stopped you before you became a monster - I don\u2019t want you to ever turn out like that this time, Tom.\u201d\nTom tutted, lowering his wand. \u201cYou\u2019re a fool, Harry. Emotions like that will destroy you; they\u2019ve tricked you into thinking that I could be something good, but we both know there\u2019s no good in me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m the good in you,\u201d Harry said, mirroring Serafino\u2019s words. \u201cI can balance you out.\u201d\nTom chuckled darkly, holding Harry\u2019s chin between his fingers. \u201cYour devotion is idiotic but admirable, my dear. Will you allow me to show my devotion to you?\u201d\nHarry nodded weakly as Tom lowered his head to kiss Harry. He allowed Tom to take control as he stripped them of their clothes and lowered Harry to the rocks.\nThere was kissing, and touching, and when Tom was finally inside Harry, Harry felt like he\u2019d regained a part of him that he hadn\u2019t even known was missing. The pleasure was almost unbearable, leaving Harry dazed, lost in the electricity and the heat. \nHarry was Tom\u2019s, and Tom was his.\n***\nHarry woke up the following morning, sore and stiff. \nHis head was resting on Tom\u2019s chest, and he could feel the steady heartbeat beneath Tom\u2019s skin. Harry closed his eyes again, listening to the drumming of Tom\u2019s heart.\nYesterday was not how Harry imagined things turning out. He had failed to save Hepzibah, but Tom had invited Harry to come with him when he travelled. In the past, without Harry, Tom had travelled alone and had nobody to draw him away from the Darkness. Maybe Harry\u2019s destiny had never been to save Hepzibah, but to save Tom by showing him the mistake he had made from killing her. Hepzibah had always been destined to be nothing but a pawn, but who was she to Harry anyway? Tom was the one who mattered.\nAnd sex with Tom - well that had been the most exhilarating experience of Harry\u2019s life. It had been intense and electrifying, full of passion and need and desire. Harry had never felt more complete than in that moment, and he knew Tom had felt it, too.\nThere was, of course, the minor detail that the sex had taken place after a murder and Horcrux creation, but Harry had always known that Tom was a killer. If Harry could bring Tom away from the Darkness he was rapidly falling into, perhaps Tom\u2019s past sins could be forgiven.\nOr maybe Harry was just being selfish, denying Tom\u2019s wickedness because he couldn\u2019t bear to leave him. No matter the reason, however, Harry had fallen in love with Tom without meaning to. He deserved to be happy and loved for once in his life, and if Tom was the person to make Harry feel complete, then so be it. \nA bird hooted nearby, and Harry sat up as he felt Tom stirring. The owl had dropped a package by their side, and Harry could see his own name scrawled across the packaging.\nHarry reached for it, tearing the packaging away to find an ornate knife, blade gleaming in the bright sun. The handle was adorned with black jewels, and embedded lines were stained with red, creating a pattern. There was a note with the knife, reading:\n\u2018Stay safe, my friend. Be the good for him. Serafino.\u2019\n\u201cA vampire blade?\u201d Tom murmured, pressing his bare chest to Harry\u2019s back, and resting his chin on Harry\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIs that to kill me with, my dear?\u201d\nHarry shook his head as Tom pressed a soft kiss to his neck.\n\u201cOf course you wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Tom agreed, breathing against Harry\u2019s neck. He reached for the knife, turning Harry\u2019s hand over and pressing the tip of the blade against his palm. \u201cTo kill your soulmate could destroy a person.\u201d\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Harry stated, wincing only slightly as Tom pressed down on the blade and drew a marking into Harry\u2019s palm, with sharp lines that crossed over each other.\n\u201cOf course I know,\u201d Tom purred, stretching his other arm over Harry so he could bring the knife to his own palm, copying the marking on his own skin. \u201cThere is a connection between us that even our magic feels; your wand has the same core as mine - from the exact same phoenix - and you make me feel in such a way that no other person has. I do not know how to love, or even if I can, but you\u2019re the one person I wish to have by my side for all time. Your vampire friend only confirmed my theory when he came to me and told me not to make the same mistake that he made. You should know, my dear, that I never intend to hurt you.\u201d\nTom dropped the bloodied knife onto the rock beside them, and reached for Harry\u2019s hand. Tom pressed their palms tightly together, the cuts on Harry\u2019s palm stinging, albeit not entirely uncomfortably.\n\u201cThe soul runes,\u201d Tom explained. \u201cWe\u2019re both two parts of one.\u201d\nHarry nodded, turning his head to kiss Tom. \nThe kiss grew more needy, more passionate, and Harry only pulled away when he needed air.\n\u201cIf you truly believe we\u2019re soulmates then you\u2019ll stop creating Horcruxes,\u201d Harry said, knowing he needed to get this out. \u201cYou have plenty, and I meant what I said yesterday - I don\u2019t want you to become a monster.\u201d\n\u201cWould you create a Horcrux for me?\u201d Tom countered, trailing his fingers gently across Harry\u2019s scar. \nHarry shivered at the pleasant tingling that shot through his body, but still managed to shake his head.\n\u201cI\u2019m not a killer,\u201d he said, keeping his gaze locked on Tom\u2019s face.\n\u201cBut if you die, dear,\u201d Tom murmured, dropping his fingers to trace Harry\u2019s lips, before moving down to his neck. \u201cI think I\u2019d go entirely insane without you.\u201d\nIf that was a promise that Tom would try to keep his just-there-sanity provided Harry stayed with him, then Harry didn\u2019t mind that the bond between them was based upon an unhealthy premise. Harry remaining alive would hopefully keep Tom from killing, but Harry wasn\u2019t prepared to do his own killing to ensure that. There was one thing he knew could work, however.\n\u201cI\u2019ll collect the Hallows,\u201d Harry said. \u201cYou can have your Horcruxes, and I\u2019ll be the Master of Death. We can be immortal together; travel the world together.\u201d Anything to keep Tom away from the Dark Arts. \u201c\u2018I\u2019ve found them once before; I can find them again.\u201d\nTom\u2019s lips curled in a cold smile, and he brought his bloodied hand to Harry\u2019s mouth, smearing the blood across his lips before leaning in to kiss him, sealing the bond between them for good."
