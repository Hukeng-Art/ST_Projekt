    "text": "\nAuthor note: Hello, there! I would strongly, STRONGLY advise turning on the Creator\u2019s Style for this fic. As much of it contains two individuals writing back and forth, having the text style active will make it significantly easier to distinguish between the writers, and the read will be a much more enjoyable experience. :)\n\n\u201cHarry? What are you on the floor for?\u201d\nHarry looked up. Ron stared down at him with a baffled expression from the other end of the aisle, a stack of books in his hands.\nTrying desperately not to appear as shocked as he felt, Harry gave his friend a casual shrug and lifted the first book he touched. \u201cSorry, just\u2026 got distracted.\u201d\nRon peered at the cover and scratched his head. \u201cReally? You could've just asked mum, you know. We've always got loads in the garden.\" He hefted the weight of his books and jerked his head toward the front of the shop. \"I'm going to go find Hermione. Meet you outside in a few?\u201d\n\u201cYes, definitely,\u201d Harry agreed, waving absently.\nOnce Ron was gone, he looked at the book in his hand to figure out what Ron had been talking about. He grimaced upon reading Garden Snails: Miracle or Mother Nature's Menace? Shoving it back onto the shelf, he crawled forward to pick up the book he'd actually been investigating (and subsequently dropped and stumbled away from) just prior to Ron's interruption.\nThe book in question was a small, leather journal wrapped in twine. One piece of yellowed parchment was inside, folded in half at the spine to give the journal a mere two pages to its name. There was nothing on the cover: no markings, no symbols, no writing. The leather wasn't even straight; rather than cut or folded into a neat rectangle, it was an inconsistent shape, but at its widest points was still no bigger than about five by seven inches. It looked, for all intents and purposes, like something a five year old had put together on an idle evening.\nHarry normally wouldn't have given it a second thought, had it not been just under the perfectly ordinary journal he'd picked up. The drastic difference was curious enough for him to flip it open and eye the lack of pages in confusion when something alarmingly familiar happened.\nInk began filling the page.\n\u2014going back. I almost wish I'd died in the war instead. Everyone would have been better off.\nNow that he was seeing the words long enough to actually read them, Harry sucked in his breath sharply.\nHad he taken a moment to consider the situation, his instincts would have reminded him firmly of Riddle\u2019s diary. This wasn\u2019t normal; this wasn\u2019t safe. Of course, it was possible that the notebook was some sort of harmless magical toy, but harmless coincidences didn\u2019t seem to happen much in his life. Besides, Arthur Weasley\u2019s warning not to trust anything that thought for itself if you couldn\u2019t see where it kept its brain still tended to rattle about in his skull. He typically erred on the side of Dangerous Artefact these days; it was better safe than sorry.\nBut he didn\u2019t take that moment. The desperately miserable words struck an instant blow. Without thinking about Riddle, he removed a pen from his pocket (much as he loved quills, he missed the easy convenience of pens and pencils) and wrote back.\nDon't ever wish that. The only way for a problem to be fixed is to survive it.\nNothing happened for a few seconds, and then writing began flooding the page beneath his in a spill of angry, blue lines.\nWho is this? Where are you? Why are you writing to me? How did you find this parchment? If this is a trick, I'm not going to fall for it. Who sent you? I've got nothing to tell!\nTaken aback, Harry hurriedly started to write again. For a few words they overlapped, but the other stopped after a moment to let Harry finish.\nNobody sent me! I found this in a bookstore. I'm just buying textbooks. Why do you think somebody's after you?\nThe space underneath remained blank long enough for Hermione and Ron to come looking for him, already done checking out. He hurriedly grabbed the last of his textbooks and went to pay before the three of them headed off to lunch.\nThe journal left with them, tucked in Harry\u2019s back pocket.\n\n\n\nIn the bustle of getting ready to return to school\u2014and how strange was that? The idea of returning to Hogwarts after a year hungry, tired, terrified, and on the run was surreal\u2014Harry forgot about the journal for a time.\nHe remained at the Burrow for a few days before he and Ron went to to visit the Grangers, now that they were back from Australia. However, as the restoration of their memories and news of all Hermione had endured during their absence had left the family rather uncomfortably prone toward breaking out in tears and spontaneous hugs, the boys didn\u2019t stay long. Brushing off Ron\u2019s insistence that Harry return with him, Harry reminded him that he needed to see to Kreacher and start work on fixing up Sirius\u2019s house before school resumed.\nBidding each other farewell, the trio parted ways for the summer.\nIt wasn\u2019t until Harry arrived at Grimmauld Place alone that he finally had a chance to remember the journal. After fixing himself some dinner under Kreacher\u2019s wary eye and settling in the drawing room, Harry was rather disappointed when he opened up the journal to find nothing new.\nChewing on his lip consideringly, he got out his quill and ink and began to write.\nAre you still there? I\u2019m sorry for startling you. I hope, based on your shocked reaction, that you are a person and not just a very sentient spell.\nHe waited a few minutes, both to see if the other person responded and to try and decide what more to say. He felt a little self-conscious writing to himself if the other person had binned their journal, but feeling self-conscious wasn\u2019t enough to stop him.\nMy name is Harry.\nI got all of my books, if you were wondering.\nI bought a Grey Owl yesterday. I don\u2019t know what to name him yet. Any ideas?\nAt this point, he reached the end of the second page and moved to close the book, but the fall of the parchment revealed that the first page had gone blank. Realising that it must have been charmed to clear out one page once the other was filled\u2014no wonder the journal was so thin\u2014he continued writing at the top of the blank page.\nMy house is very cold. I\u2019ve cast a few warming charms, but they keep wearing off.\nDo you know anything about furniture? I think I need to do some redecorating this summer.\nI suppose it doesn\u2019t have to be this summer. There\u2019s lots of time now, right?\nI\u2019m glad I survived the war.\nI\u2019m glad you survived the war, too.\n\n\n\nWhen Harry woke up the next morning and reached for his glasses, his fingers brushed across the unexpected feeling of leather. Having forgotten he\u2019d placed the journal on the nightstand, he pulled it over as he fumbled his glasses on. He flipped open the journal, keeping himself braced for disappointment again, but to his pleasure, found everything he\u2019d written replaced by the stranger\u2019s handwriting scrawling over both pages.\nMerlin, you have no survival instincts, do you? You\u2019ve revealed to a mysteriously enchanted parchment that you\u2019re a school-aged Harry who is responsible for your own house, implying you don\u2019t have close family; who thought you might not survive the war, therefore placing you in Europe; who seems to favour babbling in English, so you\u2019re probably in the UK. Which means you\u2019re a 15-18 year old Harry Something attending Hogwarts with money and no parents. Do you even realise what someone could do with that sort of information?\nHarry\u2019s stomach dropped. He hadn\u2019t realised how much he\u2019d given away in what he\u2019d considered very neutral statements, but all strung together like that\u2026\nThe part of him that was still reeling from the recent war felt uneasy and on guard. It was now that he thought of Riddle\u2019s diary and the ongoing nightmare of second year. Then again, Riddle hadn\u2019t tried to pretend he was a living human then, just like wizarding portraits fully acknowledged that they were just portraits; he had a good feeling that this was a real person.\nAt any rate, if his mystery penpal did have hostile intentions, he probably wouldn\u2019t have announced it. Right? Right.\nWow. Aren\u2019t you perceptive? Should I be worried? I\u2019m glad to see you\u2019re still alive, though. You had me worried there.\nGetting out of bed, he took the notebook and a pen with him to the kitchen. With a flick of his wand, he heated up some of the leftover roast, potatoes, and steak and kidney pudding that Mrs. Granger had sent home with him. Her cooking wasn\u2019t quite on the level of Molly\u2019s or even his Aunt Petunia\u2019s, but it was still quite good nonetheless\u2014and still beat trying to cook without any groceries.\nWhile waiting for his coffee to boil, he flipped open the journal idly, then sat up straight when he realised there was a response.\nYour penmanship there was hideously lazy. Did you just wake up? It\u2019s gone eleven where you are.\nGrinning at the glimpse into the other person\u2019s life, Harry quickly wrote back. This time, he left the journal open in case they replied.\nThat it is, and yes, I did. It\u2019s my last summer holiday! So where are you? What\u2019s your name?\nIf you really think I\u2019m going to answer that, you\u2019re even thicker than I suspected. And there you go again with the revealing information.\nI\u2019m about to start school in a few weeks. Do you really think I\u2019d stalk you to New Zealand or wherever you are?\nNew Zealand? That\u2019s your guess? Try a little closer to home.\nEurope?\nSomewhere in there.\nItaly?\nYou\u2019re getting warmer.\nFinland?\nColder.\nSpain?\nReally? You skipped right over it.\nMy geography\u2019s a little weak. And I just woke up. Germany?\nTry France.\nOkay. If you don\u2019t want to tell me your name, what should I call you?\nYou shouldn\u2019t call me anything. You shouldn\u2019t be writing back at all. Don\u2019t you have better things to do?\nLike you observed, I don\u2019t have family to bother, and my friends have their own things to do. So, not really.\nName your owl and decorate your house.\nSuggestions?\nAfter a few minutes without a response, Harry suddenly remembered his water. He finished preparing his coffee and returned to his now-cold breakfast, but there was still nothing.\nTrying not to feel disappointed, he reheated his breakfast again and ate it.\nAlthough he checked the journal periodically throughout the day, it wasn\u2019t until he was getting into bed near midnight that a reply finally appeared.\nEltanin.\nHarry stared at the single word, waiting for an explanation. Was that a suggestion for the owl\u2019s name, or a furniture store? A city in France, maybe?\nNot for the first time, he wished the wizarding world had an equivalent of Google.\nWhat\u2019s that?\nMy name. You can call me Eltanin.\nBit of a mouthful, isn\u2019t it? El?\n\nNo.\n\nTani?\nGOD, no.\nNinny?\nYou are making me reconsider that \u201cstill alive\u201d bit.\nMerlin, don\u2019t even joke like that! I\u2019m sorry. Eltanin it is.\nHarry fell asleep waiting for a reply, hand curled around the journal.\n\n\n\nEltanin\u2019s message didn\u2019t come through until tea the next day.\nAfter a harrowing grocery experience with Molly and Ron earlier in the summer that had involved a neverending onslaught of well-wishers coming up to thank them, Harry\u2019d decided to stick with Muggle stores. Luckily, there was a Sainsbury\u2019s just up the road, so his day was spent grocery shopping in blissful anonymity. \nThis was then followed by less blissfully clearing out closets and cabinets and arguing with Kreacher about his right to bin old, worn, moth-eaten women\u2019s clothing. In exchange for letting him finish cleaning in peace, Harry agreed to Kreacher cooking for them. They were still working out which tasks Harry was comfortable delegating versus what he preferred to do himself\u2014not to mention their sometimes very different ideas of what constituted a good meal\u2014but luckily, the pork shank and pasta Kreacher fixed up was neutral enough to be perfectly palatable.\nWaiting for dinner to be finished, Harry picked up the journal again and noticed the reply.\nIf you were shopping for textbooks, why did you take this journal?\nI actually was looking at journals, too. Thought of keeping a diary or something. I don\u2019t know. Trying to\u2026 I\u2019m not even sure. Put my thoughts into words?\nI\u2019m reconsidering the 17-18 year old boy thing. Are you, in fact, a twelve year old girl?\nAs exhausted as he was from cleaning and negotiating chores with Kreacher, Harry took the mockery harder than usual. Frowning down at the words, he wrote back a curt Hilarious. and set the journal aside for the rest of the night.\n\n\n\nThis is a war-related thing, isn\u2019t it? If so, I apologize for poking fun at you. I\u2019m told that my sense of humour is barbed.\nIf it\u2019s a sexism thing, I meant no real ill against twelve year old girls, either.\nBy the next day, Harry calmed down enough to regain perspective. In retrospect, it was pretty obvious that the comment had been intended as a joke, and he felt guilty for pushing Eltanin away for it. The apologies that came through now made him feel worse.\nWhat? No! It\u2019s okay. I know you were just teasing. I\u2019m sorry I was short with you. I had a tiring day.\nProductive, though?\nNot as much as I\u2019d hoped, but yeah.\nStill no name for the owl, though. :(\nWhat is :(?\nUpon reading the question, Harry laughed. Then he frowned, realising that it wasn\u2019t necessarily a wizard versus Muggle thing; he didn\u2019t have the slightest idea what Eltanin\u2019s age was. What if he\u2014or she, actually\u2014was elderly? Something about the idea felt more than a little creepy.\nCan I ask how old you are? And if you\u2019re male or female? I just realised I was automatically assuming you were like me, even though the only things I know about you are that you live in France and speak English.\nI\u2019m close to your age. Won\u2019t say more than that. Male. I also speak Italian and a bit of Norwegian.\nWow! I only ever learned English. Why all the languages?\nNorwegian, because I wanted to attend Durmstrang. Italian, because my mother considers it romantic.\nIs it strange that I don\u2019t know what you look like, but I\u2019m picturing you rolling your eyes as you write that?\nNo stranger than the fact that I WAS rolling my eyes as I wrote that.\nWhat is :(?\nMuggles call it a smiley face. The dots are eyes, and the ( is a frown.\nWhy is it called a smiley face if it\u2019s frowning?\nUh\u2026 that\u2019s a good question, actually. I think the original ones were smiling, like :) But the name became an umbrella term?\nThat\u2019s strange. Muggles are strange.\nI take it you\u2019re a pureblood, then?\nIs that a problem?\nOf course not. Some of my best friends are purebloods. And some of my best friends are Muggleborns. As long as you\u2019re okay with that, I\u2019m okay with you.\nAre you OK with that?\nI\u2019m still working out my thoughts on the topic.\nWe should maybe avoid talking about the war.\nHarry stared at the paper long enough for Eltanin to start writing again before he could come up with a way to word his disappointment.\nOr you can try to sway me so long as you don\u2019t get angry over it.\nI grew up taught that everything Muggle was backwards, weak and uncivilised. I haven\u2019t conversed enough with Muggleborns to be convinced otherwise.\nBut I am not in favour of genocide.\nHow are Muggles \u201cbackwards, weak and uncivilised\u201d?\nThey don\u2019t have magic, they pollute the environment, they don\u2019t live as long as we do, their bodies are more susceptible to illness and damage, and their medicine is medieval. Our societies are also ultimately incompatible. Magic disrupts electronicity, and they rely on that stuff, don\u2019t they? Similarly, our society revolves around the ability to use magic. You need a wand just to use the bank. And they\u2019ve persecuted us every time they get wind of our existence.\nOkay. First, electronicity is not a word. You\u2019re combining electricity and electronics. Electronics are the devices, like a wand or artefact. Electricity makes them work, like magic. Second, Muggle medicine is very advanced. It just takes longer than a Skele-Gro or something. Third, not all Muggles pollute. A lot of them are working to save the planet.\nAnd you can\u2019t possibly blame them for having a shorter lifespan or weaker bodies? The sort of accidents that we can survive are mad, really. We\u2019re the extreme ones.\nI don\u2019t blame them. That\u2019s why I said I\u2019m not in favour of genocide. I\u2019m just also not in favour of intermingling wizards and Muggles. And the incompatibilities between our societies? And the history of persecution?\nI don\u2019t have an answer for those. I haven\u2019t dealt much with either society, really. I\u2019ve never used a Muggle bank, or tried to use much magic around electronics. But I believe humanity is creative enough to come up with workarounds if we try. Areas for high magic versus high technology, maybe.\nWe\u2019re still the same species. We\u2019re still human. That\u2019s as silly as hating someone for their skin colour.\nAnd yet Muggles do that, too, don\u2019t they? Go to war over skin colour or religions or national borders.\nAnd wizards don\u2019t?\nNot generally. There are few enough of us that since the Statute of Secrecy was established we don\u2019t often go to war unless it\u2019s with another species or as a revolution.\nMuggles AREN\u2019T a separate species. Just because there are differences between wizards and Muggles doesn\u2019t make us different species, or there wouldn\u2019t be Muggleborn wizards or Squibs. It\u2019s more comparable to genetic mutation.\nWhat\u2019s that?\nI don\u2019t know about Beauxbatons, but I really wish Hogwarts taught about biology in school\u2026 I don\u2019t know much myself, since I stopped going to Muggle schools when I was ten, but it\u2019s basically evolution. The way we change as a species as generations go on, and sometimes the changes are good, and sometimes they\u2019re not so good.\nSo you\u2019re saying that we ARE the biologically superior race.\nYou sound like Hitler.\nWho?\nMuggle version of Grindelwald. I think Hermione said they were even defeated at the same time, and were probably connected.\nThe Global Wizarding War that ended in 1945?\nYeah. There was a Muggle war going on at the same time called World War II. Again, no Muggle schooling after age ten, so I never learned much about it. We really should learn more about Muggle history in our schools, given that there are many more of them than there are wizards.\nNo, thank you. History classes are boring enough with magic involved. I don\u2019t think I could stay awake through Muggle history.\nTell me about it. My history professor is literally dead dull.\nNo immediate response came back, but Harry was distracted enough thinking about the conversation that he didn\u2019t feel like pestering Eltanin. At least he\u2019d been open to discussing the topic, even if Harry felt like he probably hadn\u2019t been able to say enough to make a difference. But he hoped he\u2019d at least given Eltanin some food for thought.\nAs he was getting ready for bed, he noticed that a response had finally come through.\nWell, Harry, it was semi-educational chatting with you. I admit I\u2019m surprisingly disappointed that I need to cut our exchange short. I\u2019ll be on holiday with my family for a time, and won\u2019t likely have enough privacy to correspond.\nBut after?\nAfter what?\nAfter you return, do you want to continue to correspond?\nWon\u2019t you be in school?\nI suppose there isn\u2019t much harm in telling you that I\u2019ll be returning to school this September as well.\nI\u2019m happy to take the journal with me if you\u2019re up to it.\nAre you sure?\nThis can\u2019t possibly go worse than the last time I kept a diary. Trust me.\nThat sounds dramatic.\nStory of my life.\nAll right, then. If you\u2019d like, and if we both remember, I\u2019ll continue to write with you once we\u2019re back in school.\nYou\u2019ll have to tell me about your last diary.\nI look forward to it! Have a good holiday.\nYou, too.\nAnd you should look up Jolie Hamlet. About the furniture, I mean.\nThanks! I\u2019ll keep that in mind!\n\n\n\nHarry did his best to leave Eltanin alone after that. He checked the journal a few times over summer in case there was a reply, but after a couple of weeks he decided that:\nA) Eltanin probably hadn\u2019t even taken the journal with him on his holiday,\nB) even if he had, he was spending the time with his family, and\nC) Harry\u2019s compulsive checking of the journal was bordering on pathetically needy.\nIt wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t have anything better to. He owled regularly with Hermione, Ron and Ginny, and exchanged a few letters with Luna and Neville. He went to visit Andromeda at least once a week to share their grief and get to know Teddy, and he even ventured into several Muggle shops to replenish the wardrobe he\u2019d completely outgrown while on the run.\nHe got in touch with Jolie Hamlet after asking Ginny the best way to do so, never having owled a stranger before. He was pleased to learn that she was an interior decorator who worked with a wide variety of clientele rather than just witches and wizards with old money or celebrity-level income. Once she realised who he was, she was more than happy to give him some advice if he wanted to embark on the project on his own or schedule a consultation if he wanted to hire her.\n(He felt guilty, of course, in case it was his name influencing her kindness. Still, he reasoned that Eltanin wouldn\u2019t have suggested her if she would have been likely to refuse him.)\nEven so, he couldn\u2019t shake his penpal from his mind. Part of it, he knew, was concern; given their rather unpleasant introduction and the other boy\u2019s hesitance toward the war, Harry couldn\u2019t help but worry about what he might have gone through and how he might decide to feel about the blood purity issue. He was relieved that Eltanin was willing to reconsider his thoughts on the matter at all, but wary that they\u2019d needed reconsidering. And of course, it disturbed him that he hadn\u2019t had a ready answer for how to intermingle their lives given the very valid points of electronics versus magic, the reliance on wands and wandwork in wizarding culture, and the history of hostility between them...\nMore selfishly, there had been something about the ready conversation with Eltanin that Harry appreciated, and he missed that most of all. It possibly had something to do with the fact that they were strangers from across the channel, so it was a very low-risk correspondence; however, that didn\u2019t explain the sense of camaraderie. More likely, it was the desire for a human connection when they were both clearly struggling with re-adjusting to a postwar world.\nHarry\u2019s desire, at least. He could only hope that it wasn\u2019t all in his head.\nThe last few days leading up to Hogwarts and the first week back at school kept him busy enough that it was easy to ignore the journal, but it wasn\u2019t long before his hands began itching for a pen. Being back in Hogwarts\u2019 corridors inevitably meant recalling the nightmarish experience of May, and between the students who\u2019d died in the war and the students who\u2019d simply not returned, the empty seats in every class were painfully apparent.\nAnd that was combining the new seventh years and those in Harry\u2019s cohort who\u2019d returned to finish out school shoved into one class. He couldn\u2019t even imagine what the lower years\u2019 classrooms would be like.\nThere weren\u2019t very many returning should-have-been-graduates, but those there were had been unofficially dubbed \u201ceighth years.\u201d It was almost funny... if it weren\u2019t for the sympathetic looks they constantly received. Were they to be pitied for something as mundane as not being able to graduate on time?\nBut those looks were still nothing compared to the ones Harry, Hermione and Ron specifically received now.\n\u201cAnyone else feel like their skin is crawling lately?\u201d Ron grumbled as the trio sat together outside at lunch, sharing a basket of food from the kitchens to avoid eating in the Great Hall.\n\u201cIf one more person asks me to sign something, I\u2019m going to scream,\u201d Hermione agreed before biting into a sandwich with a vengeance.\n\u201cThe idol worship had actually tapered off the last few years,\u201d Harry mused wistfully. \u201cThis feels like first year all over again.\u201d\nEven their fellow Gryffindors\u2014including those in their own year\u2014treated them differently now. Harry\u2019d given up trying to point out that they\u2019d had a hell of a year at Hogwarts with the Carrows and had probably suffered more torture within the walls of their beloved school than he, Hermione, and Ron had while on the run; it never did any lasting good. There was something about the mystery of their absence that seemed to place them on an uncomfortable pedestal in the eyes of their peers.\nThe Slytherins were particularly subdued this year, remaining quiet in classes and the Great Hall and sticking to the edges of corridors to stay out of everyone else\u2019s way. Unsurprisingly, their house was hit the hardest in the aftermath of the war: the house was down to only 30% of its population from previous years, and despite that most of them had been too young or neutral in the war to be allied with Voldemort, the way most of the school treated them made it very clear which side of the line they were being placed anyway.\nHarry couldn\u2019t help but worry for the the small group. Within the first week, he broke up half a dozen public confrontations where a young snake had gotten isolated from his or her (or variations thereupon) classmates and were being yelled at, insulted, or anonymously hexed.\nAnd that wasn\u2019t even counting Draco Malfoy, one of only three Slytherins from his year (along with Blaise Zabini and Daphne Greengrass) to return. He was being treated like a pariah, and while Ron insisted that he wasn\u2019t worth feeling sorry for, that didn\u2019t stop Harry from watching him.\n(\u201cI don\u2019t like bullies, Ron. It doesn\u2019t matter if he used to be. He isn\u2019t now.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s still Malfoy, mate.\u201d\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t exactly civil to him, either.\u201d)\nThen again, nothing had ever really stopped him from watching Malfoy, but at least it was without wariness or suspicion this time. There were no more glares from across a busy room, no more snide remarks, no more being shoved into walls; in fact, other than a quick and brief nod of acknowledgement on the train, Malfoy seemed to avoid him completely.\n(\u201cWell, good. He should feel gutted,\u201d Ron huffed when Harry commented on the defeated behaviour.\n\u201cCan you please pretend to possess a sense of empathy sometimes?\u201d Hermione shot at him, spurring their old argument.)\nClasses were about the only time that things almost felt normal. After the first somber day back, the professors made a point of keeping everyone busy to leave little time to dwell. After lessons, Hermione threw herself into her coursework, which everyone expected. Less expected was for Harry and Ron to do the same.\n(Nobody needed to know that it was largely an excuse to be visibly preoccupied and left alone.)\n\n\n\nThree weeks into school, while Ron was off showering, Harry picked up the journal again.\nWould Reuben be an odd name for an owl?\nRon returned to the room before Eltanin gave a response, so Harry put the journal away. The next day there was no answer, nor the one after that, nor the one after that; on the fourth day of waiting, however, Harry opened up the journal in the morning to find Eltanin\u2019s scrawling handwriting underneath his question.\nReally? You still haven\u2019t named it? And Reuben is a terrible name. He sounds like a sandwich.\nHarry laughed unexpectedly, then took a moment to be grateful that Ron could sleep through a Weird Sisters concert.\nI don\u2019t know, that seems like a pretty happy reason to go with Reuben.\nBecause it\u2019s food? Were you by chance starved as a child?\nDefinitely not having expected Eltanin to respond immediately, Harry dropped his pen in surprise as the ink began appearing as soon as he finished writing. He rooted about under his sheets for it to reply.\nActually, I kind of was. Just sometimes.\nMerlin. I was not expecting that.\nIt\u2019s okay. It didn\u2019t stunt my growth or anything.\nI can\u2019t imagine any world in which starving a child is okay. Is this an appropriate time for a :( ?\nThis time, Harry\u2019s bark of laughter did wake Ron. Covering it up with a coughing fit, Harry smiled at the blearily squinting redhead. \u201cSorry. Choked. Go back to bed.\u201d\n\u201cThe butterflies\u2019ll eat \u2018em,\u201d Ron mumbled, already drifting off again.\nSmiling affectionately, Harry turned back to the journal.\nI just woke my roommate laughing! Yes, that\u2019s the perfect time for a :(.\nSo it made you :)?\nYou catch on fast!\nI try. How is your school year going?\nIt\u2019s. I don\u2019t know. It could be better. It could be worse. It\u2019s just\nNot sure how to finish the sentence, Harry stared at the parchment.\nIt just is?\nYeah.\nNothing feels right anymore? You\u2019re happy to be back and see the people who made it, but you can\u2019t not see the people who didn\u2019t.\nAre you a Legilimens? You took the words right out of my brain.\nOcclumens, actually. Never had cause to learn Legilimency.\nI\u2019m pants at Occlumency, so you\u2019ve still got me beat.\nReally? You\u2019ve tried Occluding but couldn\u2019t?\nI can do it now, if I really need to. It takes extreme circumstances. You?\nI picked it up pretty quickly, actually.\nReally? HOW? I picked up the Patronus charm easier than Occlumency.\nYou can cast a Patronus?\nFor a moment, Harry froze, wondering if he gave too much away. After a moment, he relaxed. Eltanin had already guessed that he attended Hogwarts anyway, and everyone in Dumbledore\u2019s Army had learned to cast a Patronus.\nYeah. I take it you can\u2019t?\nHaven\u2019t really tried much.\nWhy not?\nThere was a pause, long enough that Harry almost closed the journal for the morning. Just as he was considering it, Eltanin began to write again, albeit more slowly this time.\nI\u2019m afraid to.\nAfraid why?\nI\u2019ve done some not good things. I don\u2019t really want to be consumed by maggots.\nBut you regret them? What you did?\nNo.\nDo I need to worry about you?\nYou don\u2019t even know me.\nThat doesn\u2019t matter. We\u2019ve been talking\u2026 sort of\u2026 for months\u2026 sort of.\ni think most of that time doesn\u2019t really count. But no, you don\u2019t need to worry. I regret that my unsavoury actions were necessary, but they were necessary. I can\u2019t regret that.\nSounds complicated.\nSomething like that.\nDo you want to talk about it?\nMost certainly not. So, Puddlemere or Ballycastle?\nPuddlemere, of course!\nWhat is this \u201cof course\u201d? The Bats have more wins than any other team!\nNot for long, I bet!\n\n\n\nHarry had a niche.\nHe had various niches all around the castle, but this one was a particularly nice niche. It was just large enough for him to curl up in, located in the rear of the library behind Philosophy and Religion, and had been coated in far more dust than one summer warranted. As religion wasn\u2019t much of a thing for wizards (and dense texts on philosophy not much of a thing for adolescents), it seemed to be wonderfully neglected. A limp curtain obscured half of it, as if even that had given up on trying to keep up appearances. Whatever the library used to keep in the niche was long gone.\nOn the days when Ron and Hermione were testing the waters of their newfound relationship and Harry didn\u2019t want to be alone in his room or left to fend off peers uncomfortably, he came to this niche. Sometimes he did homework; sometimes he flipped through a book; sometimes he simply sat and thought. After the first two visits, he began keeping a cushion from the Gryffindor common room there to sit on.\nHe often brought the journal with him, and many of his conversations with Eltanin took place whilst curled up in his niche.\nHarry liked his niche.\n\n\n\nThree weeks of intermittent chatting later, Eltanin asked a question that made Harry realise why he was feeling so unsettled.\nWeren\u2019t you looking at journals to keep a diary? Did you ever start doing that?\nActually\u2026 you know, I completely forgot. I got distracted by this one writing back.\nDo you still need to?\nI can\u2019t imagine when I\u2019ll get out to a shop again...\nThat\u2019s not what I was suggesting.\nHarry stared at the parchment. Surely Eltanin didn\u2019t mean...\nYeah?\nYou don\u2019t need to trust me. You can use fake names, dates, places. Outright lie if you\u2019d like. I can be quiet, or respond. But this parchment clears when it\u2019s full, right? So no evidence left behind. That\u2019s why I was using it, after all. So if you need to write, I\u2019ll not judge you. I won\u2019t even read it, if you let me know when you need it and when it\u2019s safe to check again.\nWow. I don\u2019t even know what to say\u2026 thank you.\n\n\n\nOne day, Harry looked up from his niche, waiting to see if Eltanin was around, when Malfoy turned the corner.\nIt took the blond several long seconds to spot him. He appeared to be legitimately searching for something on the shelves rather than looking for somewhere to hide, as Harry had. Harry remained quiet, not wanting to startle the Slytherin when he ordinarily worked so hard to avoid him.\nWhen Malfoy did notice him, to his credit, he didn\u2019t jump, shout, or immediately run. Unfortunately, what did happen wasn\u2019t much better. Eyes wide, hand raised to the spine of a tome, shoulders stiffening, he went completely still. It was debatable if he was even breathing.\nHarry recognised that freeze. He\u2019d seen it when Greyback got too close to Hermione while they were behind the wards in the Forest of Dean. He\u2019d seen it when Ginny was little and couldn\u2019t speak to him. He\u2019d done it every time he wore his Invisibility Cloak and somebody got dangerously close.\nFear.\nMalfoy was afraid of him.\nHarry was still struggling to get his thoughts together and find something to say when Malfoy finally moved. Very curtly turning away, he abandoned his search and left.\nFeeling ill at the idea that Malfoy, of all people, was afraid of him, Harry looked down at the journal in his hands. He shut it, held it for a moment as he debated running after his ex-rival, then opened it again and picked up his pen.\nI think one of my classmates is afraid of me and I\u2019m not sure why.\nHe closed the journal again (there was no response to the last message anyway), but almost immediately opened it back up. Eltanin had offered...\nNo, that\u2019s bollocks. I have a few theories, but they\u2019re all such rubbish.\nSomething happened that was out of either of our hands. I think he\u2019s afraid of what I might say because everybody else is treating him terribly for it. Or maybe he\u2019s ashamed of what he did. Or maybe he\u2019s depressed from everything that happened. I don\u2019t know if I should talk to him. We\u2019ve never been friends. Hated each other, actually. I don\u2019t think he\u2019d feel comfortable with a heart to heart. But Merlin, I don\u2019t want him afraid of me.\nHarry waited, but Eltanin didn\u2019t respond.\n\n\n\nCould be. Or it could be none of the above, or a combination. Or, if you hated each other before, maybe he just thinks staying out of your way is what you want. You\u2019re operating entirely on your own assumptions here.\nI apologise for the slow response. I was unwell the last few days.\nIt was four days later that the reply came through, long enough for Harry to worry that something had happened to Eltanin or the journal.\nMerlin, don\u2019t apologise for getting sick! Are you okay now?\nMore or less. Don\u2019t worry about it.\nWhat do you want to do?\nAre you sure you\u2019re okay?\nYes, I\u2019m sure. Are you avoiding the topic?\nNo! I just don\u2019t want to bother you over my problems when you\u2019re not well.\nI\u2019m well enough, or I wouldn\u2019t have written back. Ignoring your preconceived notions about this person, what do you, Harry Middlename Lastname, want to do?\nHaha.\nI don\u2019t know. Talk to him, I guess. Try to clear the air. But I don\u2019t know how to do that without scaring him away.\nYou\u2019re not scary.\nHow do you know?\nLike you said, we\u2019ve been writing off and on for months. I have a pretty good instinct for threatening people, and you\u2019re not threatening, which is why I think this person is probably just trying to appease you.\nSo I just walk up to him and say we need to talk? Given that most of our interactions in the past have been to fight, I don\u2019t know that he\u2019d take that well.\nMerlin, no. If he\u2019s avoiding you, don\u2019t corner him. But you seem to express yourself well enough in writing. Say what you want to say in a note or something.\nThat\u2019s a good idea\u2026 I\u2019ll think about it.\n\n\n\nHarry knew that Eltanin had a good point, but it felt cowardly to write his concerns to Malfoy in a note rather than face them head on. So he compromised.\nYears before, Malfoy\u2019d sent Harry a note in a folded paper crane. It had been a nasty one, of course, but Harry could appreciate the artistry of the delivery.\nHarry didn\u2019t know how to fold a crane. He sent a paper aeroplane instead.\nStanding beside a pillar, he floated the aeroplane over to where Malfoy sat in the Clock Tower Courtyard beneath one of the eagle statues. The blond jumped when the plane hit his sleeve, peered down at it, then immediately stood and swiveled around suspiciously. He tensed when he caught sight of Harry.\nFor a moment, neither of them moved. When it became clear that Malfoy was so jarred by his presence that he\u2019d forgotten the aeroplane, Harry rolled his eyes, gestured toward it, and made exaggerated unfolding and reading motions.\nMalfoy furrowed his brow through the gesticulations before cottoning on. As Harry watched, he read the note, paused, lowered it, made a complicated expression that Harry wasn\u2019t sure how to interpret, glanced at Harry, glanced back at the note, made the previous complicated expression again, and finally let out a heavy sigh.\nHe sat back down.\nHarry took that as his cue and walked over, perching at the edge of the fountain a polite distance away. \u201cHow are you?\u201d\nMalfoy gave him an unimpressed look before averting his gaze back to the ground.\nHarry resisted the urge to bristle. \u201cNo, really\u2014how are you? I know we don\u2019t like each other, but\u2026 I don\u2019t know. You went through a lot the last couple of years.\u201d And I don\u2019t think you really had anyone to talk to about it, he did not add.\n(He spared a morsel of attention to be suddenly and overwhelmingly grateful to Hermione and Ron.)\n\u201cI\u2019m not up to anything,\u201d came Malfoy\u2019s unexpected response.\nFrowning, Harry drew his legs up onto his perch and swiveled around. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you were. I know what you look like when you\u2019re planning something, Malfoy. That\u2019s not what this is about.\u201d\n\u201cThen what is it about?\u201d Malfoy muttered, crossing his arms (defensively, Harry thought). \u201cIt\u2019s not like you to concern yourself with me if I\u2019m not causing trouble.\u201d\n\u201cWe just went through a war. My perspective\u2019s shifted.\u201d\nIn the wary silence that followed, Harry let out a slow breath. \u201cThe other day, in the library. You ran away from me.\u201d Ignoring the way the blond tensed up even more, he continued. \u201cYou\u2019ve never done that before. Running from a situation, yes\u2014but out of everyone except my closest friends, you\u2019ve always been the least likely to just run away from me. Of course it bothers me.\u201d\nMalfoy toed at a patch of grass peeking up from between the stones. \u201cI\u2019d have thought it would relieve you, not bother you.\u201d\nHarry rolled his eyes. \u201cNot fighting with you anymore relieves me. Both of us being alive relieves me. Seeing you acting so defeated? Does not relieve me.\u201d\nWith a huff of something suspiciously close to laughter, Malfoy finally looked up. \u201cWhy? You hate me.\u201d\n\u201cYou hated me first,\u201d Harry pointed out.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a contest,\u201d Malfoy drawled. \u201cAnd I did not.\u201d\nHarry stared at him.\nMalfoy sighed. \u201cI didn\u2019t. I was perfectly willing to acquaint myself with you until your Weasley began laughing at me. It probably wouldn\u2019t have lasted, since we were enemies for a reason, but I most certainly did not hate you first.\u201d\nHarry wracked his brain, trying to remember what their first meeting was like. It took him a moment to realise that it hadn\u2019t even been on the train\u2014it had been Madam Malkins\u2019 robe shop. He remembered disliking the other boy immediately, but it had been long enough that he couldn\u2019t remember why. He couldn\u2019t imagine them arguing about blood purity or prejudice then, so had it been purely on the basis that Malfoy was clearly spoiled\u2026? \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t really remember,\u201d he confessed. \u201cEverything and everyone was so different from what I grew up with, I was a little overwhelmed. I remember you making fun of Ron.\u201d\n\u201cAfter he made fun of me first,\u201d Malfoy shot back.\n\u201cTwo wrongs don\u2019t make a right!\u201d\n\u201cI was a proud, spoiled, barely eleven year old child who\u2019d just been laughed at and had my friendship refused.\u201d Malfoy scowled. \u201cHow did you expect me to act?\u201d\nHarry ignored the question. \u201cYou hated me for seven years for that?!\u201d\n\u201cNo, I hated you for like thirty minutes for that. I hated you for siding with the Weasley for a couple of weeks, and then I hated you for being a nosy do-gooder for whom everything went your way for seven years.\u201d Malfoy paused to reevaluate his timeline. \u201cOr more like five, really. I didn\u2019t have the energy to care about you after that. Anyhow, the way the rules always got bent for you was ridiculous. Even Dumbledore was so bloody bias\u2014\u201d\nBelatedly catching onto whose name he\u2019d just blurted out, Malfoy froze. Harry watched him, not having any reaction beyond a pang of missing Dumbledore. Certainly, he\u2019d been Harry\u2019s headmaster and mentor, but he was under no illusion; their relationship hadn\u2019t been ideal. Dumbledore had kept far too many secrets, regularly let him go into dangerous situations as a child without backup, and had generally been a frustrating enigma. He mourned the wise man\u2019s death, but he wasn\u2019t going to break down when he came up in conversation over a year after his self-orchestrated death, especially after losing Remus and Fred and Tonks so much more recently.\nOnce Harry realised that Malfoy was waiting for some sort of cue on how to proceed, he snorted. \u201cYes? Even Dumbledore was biased, and?\u201d\nMalfoy furrowed his brow, apparently disgruntled by the anticlimactic lack of reaction. \u201cEven he was horribly biased in an entirely unprofessional manner once you came onto the scene. Distributing just enough house points for Gryffindors to pull forward, making exceptions to the rules for you all the time, excuses to protect you from the consequences of your mistakes\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHe made excuses for everyone!\u201d Harry protested. \u201cHe was a peacekeeper. He didn\u2019t want anyone to suffer if it could be avoided.\u201d\nMalfoy narrowed his eyes. \u201cThis is not an argument you want to get into with me.\u201d\n\u201cI think it is,\u201d Harry shot back. \u201cYes, that even included you. You think he didn\u2019t know what you were up to? He was hoping you\u2019d turn to him for help.\u201d\n\u201cWhy would I have done that? When has he ever given anyone in my house a reason to turn to him?\u201d Malfoy snapped.\n\u201cWhen\u2019s he ever given you a reason to not?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe when you nearly killed me and got off with nothing more than detention!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2014\u201d Harry stopped. Deflating as his expression crumpled into one of regret, he sank back and pushed up his glasses to rub his eyes. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t Dumbledore\u2019s decision; it was Snape\u2019s. The curse was his invention; he didn\u2019t want it to get out just how bad it had been.\u201d\nMalfoy stared at him with a look of disbelief. \u201cAnd that\u2019s an excuse how?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d Fixing his glasses, Harry dropped his hand miserably. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I never said it to you, but I\u2019m so sorry. We\u2019ve always been awful to each other, but I\u2019ve never wanted you to suffer like that. I never wanted you dead. I had no idea what the spell did.\u201d\n\u201cYou cast it!\u201d\n\u201cI found it in a book. It didn\u2019t say what the effects were,\u201d Harry explained. \u201cI knew it was for enemies but not what it would do, or I never would have used it on you. Nobody deserved that.\u201d\n\u201cYou used a spell when you didn\u2019t know what it would do?\u201d Draco demanded indignantly.\nYou launched a snake at me and broke my nose knowingly! Harry was tempted to return, but he bit it back. He meant what he\u2019d said: he was tired of fighting. \u201cYes,\u201d he agreed simply instead, letting his guilt fill his voice. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I did, and I know it was stupid, and I know you had to suffer for it. Particularly then, when you were struggling enough as it was.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cI also know there isn\u2019t a way to apologise enough for what I did to you, but I am sorry, and I will keep saying it. Hermione and McGonagall read me the Riot Act, but I know that doesn\u2019t begin to make up for it. If there\u2019s anything\u2014\u201d\nMalfoy was grimacing uncomfortably from halfway through, but at that point he began waving Harry off frantically. \u201cStop, stop, stop. You\u2019re sorry, I get it. I\u2019m sorry for being a prick to you for the past x number of years, too. Can we please stop emoting now?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not emoting!\u201d Harry protested. \u201cWe\u2019re having a civilised discussion on past mistakes and making amends!\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not \u2018making amends\u2019; we\u2019re absolving our senses of guilt with half-meant apologies,\u201d Malfoy argued.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not half-meant! At least, mine aren\u2019t half-meant!\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re absolutely half-meant,\u201d Malfoy scoffed with a sharp laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re honestly sorry for nearly killing me, but you\u2019re not sorry for the way you treated me growing up because you still resent the way I treated you, and vice versa. No apologising now changes the fact that we meant everything we\u2019ve said and done to each other. I still think you\u2019re annoying and get off easy for everything, even if I can acknowledge that you suffered a lot to do the right thing and were mostly right in the end.\u201d\n\u201cMostly right?\u201d Harry echoed, feeling so indignant and bewildered that his emotions circled right back around to amused. Nobody\u2014not even Ron when they were fighting\u2014managed the level of blunt rudeness that Malfoy did even on a polite day.\nIgnoring him, the blond continued on. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure you still think I\u2019m arrogant and selfish, even if you can acknowledge that I\u2019m not as evil as you thought and don\u2019t deserve to die. So. If we could leave the sentiment there and resume ignoring each other, it would be lovely.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to ignore each other!\u201d Groaning, Harry rubbed his eyes. \u201cIgnoring each other isn\u2019t like us. It\u2019s unnatural. The whole reason I came to talk to you was because it was weird.\u201d\n\u201cWell, you don\u2019t want to fight, and you don\u2019t want to ignore each other, and you don\u2019t want to be friends, so what exactly do you want?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Harry admitted. \u201cI mean\u2026 no, I don\u2019t know. I guess we could try to be\u2014\u201d\nHarry was cut off with a sharp wave of Malfoy\u2019s hand. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare finish that sentence. Neither of us want to be friends, so trying to force it would be pointless and superficial at best. Can we just ignore each other in a less tense and more \u2018You\u2019re-my-classmate-but-I-don\u2019t-care-about-you\u2019 way?\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Harry agreed quickly. He was disappointed in the way one always was when told they were not wanted, but he couldn\u2019t deny also being relieved; this was better than suffering through failed attempts at forced politeness.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Malfoy echoed. \u201cIf you\u2019re done making me tremendously uncomfortable now, please go away.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Harry agreed again, standing. He paused awkwardly, feeling like he should say something else but not knowing what it was. \u201cWell\u2026\u201d\nMalfoy made a shooing motion.\n\u201cBye,\u201d Harry blurted out before turning and walking back to the castle.\n\n\n\nYou cornered him, didn\u2019t you?\nLying in bed that night with the journal open in the middle of a textbook, Harry muffled his laugh with a cough.\nIn the bed to his right, Ron sighed. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re getting yourself sick over homework.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not getting sick,\u201d Harry replied with a smile as he wrote back. \u201cJust something stuck in my throat.\u201d\nI took your advice and wrote to him first! And then kind of cornered him, yeah. Maybe a little. But I gave him the chance to say no!\nI bet you absolutely cornered him.\nI\u2019m not very patient, I guess. Besides, he\u2019s been avoiding me, so I was afraid he would ignore a note if I wasn\u2019t there to get an answer right away.\n\u201cThat \u2018something\u2019 is a study bug. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re doing homework in bed,\u201d Ron grumbled. \u201cYou\u2019re turning into Hermione.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just some light reading,\u201d Harry replied distractedly.\n\u201cYou\u2019re definitely turning into Hermione.\u201d\nSo what was the answer?\nHe said\nHarry\u2019s quill paused as he ran the conversation over in his head, trying to figure out if he\u2019d gotten an actual answer.\nDid you run out of ink?\nNo, just thinking, sorry. I don\u2019t know. It was kind of an intense talk at times. We both had things to clear up and apologise for. Misunderstandings, differences in perspective or memory. I think he just didn\u2019t know how to treat me? We weren\u2019t fighting anymore, but we didn\u2019t know what to do or say in place of that.\nAnd the final decision?\nIgnore each other less obviously?\n\u201cI\u2019ve been replaced by Hogwarts: A History,\u201d Ron huffed.\nAnd are you satisfied with that decision?\nNot really. But he made it clear he didn\u2019t want to be friends.\nDo you want to be friends? You said you hated each other?\nWe did. We do. Did? I\u2019m not sure. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think we\u2019d know how to be friends. I don\u2019t hate him now, but I don\u2019t think I like him, either? I think I had some things wrong about him, or at least not entirely right. I guess I don\u2019t really know who he is outside of the things we\u2019d fight over.\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t even listening to me right now!\u201d Ron complained.\n\u201cI am, I absolutely am,\u201d Harry replied distractedly, responding more to the tone than the words; Hermione had years of practice with expressing that exact sentiment.\nThat\u2019s all right.\nIs it?\nSure. You don\u2019t need to be friends with everybody. Ignoring someone you used fight with is still several steps up.\nI don\u2019t know.\nYou\u2019re saying that a lot. What do you know?\n\u201cI\u2019m going to throw \u2018Mione over for Luna, I think,\u201d Ron announced.\nHarry frowned down at the journal, trying to figure out the right words. \u201cThat\u2019s nice,\u201d he replied absently as he began slowly, carefully penning his thoughts.\n\u201cAnd maybe Seamus.\u201d\n\u201cLet me know how that goes.\u201d\nWe spent so many years aware of each other. Glaring and exchanging petty insults on a good day, or hospitalising each other on bad ones. Being ignored by him was weird. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll manage polite indifference. I\u2019m not sure I know how to\u2014\u2014\nHarry\u2019s writing cut off abruptly when a pillow hit the side of his head. \u201cOw! What\u2019s that for?\u201d he scowled, tossing it back to Ron\u2019s bed.\nThe redhead was rolled onto his side, his back to Harry. \u201cI\u2019m not talking to you.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking to me right now,\u201d Harry pointed out, bewildered. \u201cWhat did I do?\u201d\n\u201cLa la la LA LA LA.\u201d\nRolling his eyes, Harry turned back to the journal. \u201cGood night, Ron.\u201d\nHow to what?\nSorry, my roommate just threw a pillow at me. I was trying to say I don\u2019t know how to stop being aware of him.\nEltanin didn\u2019t respond, which Harry was used to by now. He knew the other boy went to Beauxbatons and studied hard, so he generally assumed extended silences were him talking to somebody, getting caught up in coursework, or when it was late, falling asleep.\nHarry waited for a bit just in case, and then he gave up for the night. He closed the book, just missing the words that appeared across the page.\nMaybe he doesn\u2019t know how to stop being aware of you, either.\n\n\n\nThe winter holidays came, and Ron and Hermione went.\nRon had long ago given up being irritated with Harry\u2019s distraction. Based on bits of overheard (and quickly hushed) conversations between his best friends, Harry strongly suspected that Hermione\u2019d lectured him on patience and acceptance of people\u2019s different coping methods after the war.\nHarry wanted to argue that he was coping just fine. Given that this thought was usually accompanied by holing himself up in his niche or losing track of time thinking or avoiding the Great Hall more and more, however, he decided he really had no leg to stand on and was better off keeping his mouth shut.\nIt was almost a relief when Ron returned to the Burrow and Hermione returned to her parents in December. Of course Harry missed them, and of course he\u2019d been invited to both of their homes for the hols, but he really just wanted some peace and quiet and no strained attempts at normalcy.\nThe celebrity worship had died down a bit, fortunately. As their peers remembered that Harry, Hermione and Ron were their ordinary, familiar classmates and not just Dark Lord Slayers, things gradually returned to normal. There was still a bit of gawking from the younger years, but Harry, at least, was used to that much.\nLess fortunately, the attitude toward Slytherins had not died down. There were fewer hexes being thrown at them now, as the professors had put a stop to that nonsense as early as they could, but the sense of clear exclusion was still there. Harry tried to offer them smiles when he saw them or intervene if someone was being picked on, but he couldn\u2019t be in twelve places at once. And it was frankly exhausting.\nJust another reason to be grateful for the empty castle now.\nHarry was in his niche again when Malfoy showed up, rounding the corner once more and triggering a distinct sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\nThis time, Malfoy saw him more quickly. He still froze, but unstuck himself after a moment. With a curt nod of acknowledgment, he turned his attention back to the shelves and began pulling out books to inspect them.\nSince their talk, things were better between the two of them, but still strange. Their eyes often met out of pure habit when one would enter the other\u2019s space, whether it was a classroom or a courtyard, and there was always that moment of \u201cWhat do I do?\u201d before one would break the eye contact. Malfoy no longer went out of his way to stay far away from him, however, so Harry couldn\u2019t really complain.\nWell\u2026 he couldn\u2019t complain, but really, he wanted to.\nComing to a decision, Harry stood up. \u201cHey, Malfoy. Are you busy?\u201d\nMalfoy frowned suspiciously at him. \u201cI\u2019m preparing for the Transfigurations project\u2026 Why?\u201d\nHarry cocked his head in the general direction of the door. \u201cBecause the castle\u2019s nearly empty, and I\u2019m bored. We could play a little Seeker versus Seeker?\u201d\nMalfoy\u2019s eyebrows rose impressively. \u201cIn this weather? Are you mad?\u201d\nShrugging, Harry smiled wryly. \u201cIt\u2019s just snow and wind. We\u2019ve flown in much worse conditions.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s true\u2026 but why?\u201d Malfoy\u2019s desire to turn tail and flee was nearly palpable. \u201cWe\u2019re not friendly enough to play a game together.\u201d\nHarry gave an exaggeratedly dramatic eye roll. \u201cBecause we\u2019re not enemies anymore, either, and I\u2019d offer to play with any classmate who liked flying. Besides, we\u2019ve played against each other for years.\u201d And really, they flew well together, pulling off absolutely suicidal stunts trying to compete with one another or throw the other off their game.\nHe missed flying. He missed Quidditch. He didn\u2019t miss avoiding Slytherin Beaters (the dirty cheaters), but he did rather miss the intensity of playing against Malfoy. Their games had certainly never been boring.\nHe could see Malfoy waffling, so Harry decided to help him make the right choice.\nHe smirked. \u201cScared, Malfoy?\u201d\nFor the first time in ages, the competitive glint returned to the blond\u2019s eye. Making a scoffing sound, he shoved his books back onto the shelves. \u201cYou wish. See you on the pitch, Potter.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t take too long, or I\u2019ll assume you forfeit,\u201d Harry shot back.\n\u201cIn your dreams!\u201d\n\n\n\nIncidentally, Harry did sometimes dream about Malfoy.\nUsually, they were boring dreams. Flashes of the Slytherin in nightmares about failing exams or wandering the corridors or playing Quidditch, memories of one-sided snowball fights, or irrational feelings of anger or resentment as he searched for his rival but couldn\u2019t find him anywhere. The inevitable sort of dreams one had when they spent too much time around someone for years.\nThis particular summer, the dreams had involved more\u2014more darkness, more fire, more fear. But then again, all of Harry\u2019s dreams then had involved fear.\nAfter the spontaneous Seeker\u2019s game that snowy afternoon, the dreams of flying came back: Malfoy on a broom, racing toward the sky, but this time pursuing light instead of pursued by it. They were cool instead of hot, green and blue instead of angry orange and red, open and free instead of trapped.\nAnd for the first time in over a year, Harry dreamt of laughter.\n\n\n\nHow would you, hypothetically speaking, make someone who doesn\u2019t want to be friends your friend?\nHypothetically, it would depend on how strong their feelings on the matter are and what sort of history we had. What are you planning?\nNothing yet.\n\u201dYet\u201d?\nThere\u2019s this person. I think being friends would be good for us. But he\u2019s said he doesn\u2019t want to.\nIf he has directly declined, then I\u2019d suggest leaving it alone.\nLeaving things alone is not my forte.\nThen why are you asking me instead of one of your friends who\u2019d actually know the both of you?\nMy friends would not agree with me.\nMaybe you should listen to them.\nNo\u2026 I left it alone for a while, but it\u2019s not\u2003I don\u2019t It doesn\u2019t feel right. I\u2019m going to do this. I just thought I\u2019d get some advice on how to do it.\nNever had to convince someone to be your friend before?\nNot really. People and I seem to either just get along from the start or never click.\nIs this that bloke who was avoiding you? The one you ignored my advice and cornered?\nYes, actually.\nWell, then, ignore my advice and corner him.\nEltanin\u2026\nI\u2019m kidding. Merlin, don\u2019t be so serious about this. You\u2019re looking for a friend, not a business partner. Just say hello here and there, probably out of the public eye if you\u2019ve got history. Give him space to get used to the idea, and start bumping it up to invitations. Don\u2019t overdo it, or you\u2019ll probably make him think you\u2019re up to something.\nAre you up to something?\nHa. No.\nDo you think he\u2019s up to something?\nWhat would he be up to? The war is over and he keeps to himself.\nThat\u2019s not a no.\nNo. I mean, no, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s up to anything. I just don\u2019t want to go back to what we were before, but I don\u2019t like where we\u2019re at now. I think it\u2019s worth trying to move forward.\nAnd if you trip and fall along the way?\nBetter to have loved and lost than never loved at all?\n...Harry.\nWhat?\nAre you hinting something there?\nWhat? Oh. God, no! That\u2019s not what I mean at all. I don\u2019t fancy him! I mean, friend-love, family-love, just\u2026 good things, you know? The good things make the bad worth it.\nMmhmm.\nI mean it! I\u2019m straight. I think?\nYou think, or you assume?\nBoth?\nWrong answer. Either you\u2019ve thought about it and came to the conclusion, or you haven\u2019t thought about it and made a baseless assumption.\nIt\u2019s not baseless! I\u2019ve fancied girls.\nHave you also fancied boys?\nNO!\nNo need to get so adamant about it. I have.\nYou\u2019re queer?\nThat depends on how you define it. If you mean anything not heterosexual, yes. If you mean homosexual, you\u2019re making assumptions again. I never said I didn\u2019t fancy birds as well.\nOh. Sorry if I offended you there. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with it at all. I just hadn\u2019t thought about it before in relation to me. The idea took me by surprise.\nIt tends to do that.\nAre you cross with me?\nNot at all. I\u2019m just letting you digest this conversation.\nOh. Thanks. I don\u2019t know why I still bother to make assumptions\u2026 my life\u2019s had a lot of being wrong about people, or at least not entirely right.\nAssumptions are natural. They\u2019re mental shortcuts. We\u2019d have no time to do anything else if we didn\u2019t rely on judgment calls. I bet that for all the wrong assumptions you made, many more of them were right. We\u2019re just used to that, so we don\u2019t think about it.\nThat\u2019s not really a good excuse, though. We SHOULD think about it. People get hurt when we make baseless assumptions.\nSo don\u2019t make baseless assumptions. Make educated ones.\nI mostly just trust my gut.\nAnd that\u2019s why people get hurt. When you interact with someone who isn\u2019t friend or family, you\u2019re not already privy to how they think and what their motives may be, and vice versa. Your actions may make sense to you but just completely confuse or alarm someone else if you\u2019re not on the same page. Not even a Legilimens walks around reading people\u2019s thoughts all day.\nHuh. I\u2019ll keep that in mind.\n\n\n\nHarry did keep it in mind.\nHe kept it in mind when he encountered Malfoy in the corridors the next day. \u201cHey, Malfoy,\u201d he greeted casually as he swept past. When the blond paused and turned to stare at him, Harry tried to imagine how he\u2019d feel if their roles had been reversed and Malfoy had started greeting him instead. Confused, suspicious, waiting for the other shoe to drop\u2026 well, he assumed most of those doubts would be eased with time.\nHe kept it in mind when he saw him in the library while working on a DADA project. \u201cOh, excellent, you\u2019re tall\u2014would you mind grabbing that book for me up there? The blue one by Caskey?\u201d Malfoy stared at him, but obligingly fetched the book off a high shelf and passed it off to the other man. Harry opened his mouth again to push for another game or chat or something, but Malfoy turned his back to him immediately, clearly shutting him out. Noting his hunched shoulders and the tense lines of his body and the way he huddled closer to the shelves, Harry wondered what was going through his head. Was he feeling bothered? Cornered? Irritated? Was he already making up polite rejections just in case? Not wanting to push him when he was already so guarded, Harry opted to thank him quietly and head off instead.\nHe kept it in mind when he looked around the Great Hall at lunch and noticed that Malfoy wasn\u2019t there. His first instinct was, of course, to hunt him down and feed him, as he\u2019d spent so many years alone wishing somebody would hunt him down and feed him, but\u2014well, that was obviously him projecting his own thoughts and desires onto his peer. Maybe he\u2019d already eaten. Maybe he wasn\u2019t feeling well. Maybe he really wanted to be alone. Harry stayed seated.\nHe kept it in mind when he arrived to Herbology late, looked around, and saw only two seats open. One was by Michael Corner (who was not a bad fellow, but come on, he\u2019d dated Cho just after Harry and Ginny just before; Harry was allowed to feel weird about him) and the other was by Malfoy. Without needing to think about it, he made a beeline for the Slytherin after a moment\u2019s pause and tapped his shoulder to ask permission to sit. He earned a very disturbed look from Malfoy and reminded himself of Eltanin\u2019s \u201cout of the public eye\u201d comment, but the blond nodded nonetheless so he took a seat.\nHe kept it in mind when he found Malfoy one evening at the library. Malfoy glanced up at him before glancing away again but didn\u2019t seem particularly agitated this time, so Harry suggested another Seeker versus Seeker game. He kept it in mind as Malfoy then became uncomfortable, looking around anxiously as if to make sure nobody else heard; rather than jumping to his own conclusions, he asked what Malfoy was looking for.\n\u201cNothing. No one,\u201d Malfoy replied quickly. \u201cJust making sure\u2026 you know, I don\u2019t even know.\u201d Harry patiently waited for an answer. \u201c... All right, I suppose. Why not?\u201d\n(Harry dreamt of flying again that night.)\nHe kept the other part of the conversation in mind, too.\nWhen he caught his gaze lingering on someone, he took a moment to note if they were male or female, or at least particularly masculine or feminine. He tried to compare the type of attention against the way he\u2019d felt about Ginny a year before as opposed to when they were younger or even now. He decided it wasn\u2019t a very good gauge, given that she\u2019d been too shy to talk with him before and things were still a bit awkward between them at the moment.\nWhen Seamus jokingly flirted with boys in his exuberant, charismatic way, Harry observed how their peers reacted compared to how he himself reacted. There wasn\u2019t much notable difference there, but then again, Harry could definitively state that he was in no way attracted to his friend so it probably made for a poor experiment.\nWhen he felt flustered whilst interacting with somebody, Harry tried to determine the reason for it. Was there a trend to what sort of gender-related characteristic made him feel awkward or shy or goofy? How often had he felt intimidated in the past by someone based on their superficial appearance or mannerisms? Cho, obviously, with her long, dark hair and warm smile and kind demeanor everywhere from a classroom to up in the air on a broom. Ginny with her fiery hair and equally fiery wit, her excellent humour and willingness to play rough. Oliver Wood had certainly been intimidating, but Harry decided that the intimidation factor there had come more from his obsessive, almost over the top fixation on Quidditch more so than his good looks. Cedric\u2026 who still hurt to think about, who still appeared in Harry\u2019s nightmares sometimes, but who also appeared sometimes in his dreams, all bright smiles and sun-kissed skin and wavy hair and sturdy build and\u2026\nHuh.\nIn the end, Harry decided that his bout of heavy introspection was Eltanin\u2019s fault, so it would be best to return to the source.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m second-guessing everything now thanks to you.\nOh, gods. What did I say?\nA lot of things. The thing about assumptions is okay, but the other one about whether I think or know that I\u2019m straight...\nOh, Merlin. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m prepared to walk you out of your closet.\nI don\u2019t even know if I have a closet to be walked out of! I can\u2019t even figure out anymore if I liked people because I fancied them or because I found them respectable or just objectively attractive, and therefore automatically unnerving.\nWell, describe the people you know you\u2019ve fancied, and then describe the people you\u2019re not sure about.\nMy ex-girlfriends looked nothing alike, really. Both had long, straight hair? Both were lean, but that could be because they both played Seeker. They were both smart. One has black hair and brown eyes and the other has red hair and green eyes. One was sweet, but too\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Emotional? Our timing was awful. We had kind of a bad break up. The other is very reasonable, hilarious, loyal, absolutely wonderful. Definitely has a temper to her, though. I just think I see her as more of a sister.\nAnyone else?\nI guess my friend\u2019s now sister-in-law caught my eye at first, but she\u2019s a Veela, so I\u2019m pretty sure that was the only reason why\u2026 she\u2019s certainly beautiful and tough, and I respect her dedication to her family, but I\u2019m not interested in her.\nAll right. And the ones, presumably non-female, you\u2019re not sure about?\nMy Quidditch captain was very fit, but I think I liked his enthusiasm for the sport more than anything else. An older boy in a different house\u2026 actually, he was also a Quidditch captain, and played seeker. Definitely not small like my exes, though. Maybe my friend\u2019s brother. Very tall, very handsome, really great style. Long hair, fanged jewelry, that sort of thing. He has a pretty dangerous job.\nDid he also play Quidditch?\nNot that I know of, although most of his family did. Actually, one of his brothers is really neat. He was an amazing Quidditch player in my house, before I came here. People say he could\u2019ve gone professional, but he went to study dragons instead, how great is that? I haven\u2019t spent much time with him, but the rest of the family clearly adores him, and he seems really confident.\nI\u2019m laughing at you.\nWhat? Why?!\nI suspect you like Quidditch more than people. If you put out an advert to pull someone, your requirements would say: \u201cConfident, roughhousing athlete with a strong will.\u201d\nOh, Merlin. If you put it that way...\n\u201dLong hair recommended. Family sentiment is a must.\u201d\nWhat do you mean by that?\nYou fancied, or came close to fancying, three siblings from your friend\u2019s family plus their sister-in-law. Either this entire family looks like rock stars or you\u2019re particularly drawn to strong family ties.\nHuh.\nAnyone else to take into consideration?\nI don\u2019t know. Maybe.\nMaybe?\nWell, when you put it that way, the person I\u2019m trying to befriend also is confident, plays rough, plays Quidditch, and is extremely loyal to his family.\nYou hadn\u2019t mentioned being attracted to him, other than by your inability to leave him alone.\nWell, of course he\u2019s attractive. That\u2019s a given.\nHow is that a given?\nIf you saw him, you\u2019d understand. Lean, pale, princely. Sharp features like a model, a smug smirk. He used to walk around like he expected the world to bow down at his feet. It should\u2019ve looked ridiculous, but he actually sort of pulled it off. His narrow-minded pride used to make me so angry, but I think the war shifted a lot of that. I don\u2019t like seeing him so defeated, though. It doesn\u2019t suit him. For all that I wanted to hex him anytime he opened his mouth, it feels wrong to see him not happy or sure of himself. At least I\u2019ve got him flying again sometimes. There was never anything like the thrill of going against him. He played dirty but flew brilliantly. It\u2019s even better without the rest of the team now. No Quaffles to worry about, no Beaters to dodge, just us and a Snitch.\nQuidditch again.\nHaha. That\u2019s the part that stands out?\nSorry, it\u2019s getting late. I\u2019m a bit tired.\nAh, sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to keep you up! You should go to bed.\nYes, I think I will. Good night, Harry.\nGood night, Eltanin.\nTrying not to be disappointed by the abrupt departure, Harry put the journal away, set his glasses on the nightstand, and crawled under his covers.\nJust before he drifted off, he dimly recalled Eltanin counting three siblings. He stayed conscious long enough to wonder when he\u2019d mentioned that Ginny was related to Bill and Charlie, but the thought was soon lost to sleep.\n\n\n\nAs the year wore on, it became progressively more difficult for Harry to escape into his niche. Between lessons, preparing for N.E.W.T.s, attempting to keep up with Ginny and Neville and Luna and other friends, ducking more persistent fans, avoiding the constant onslaught of owls from various publications, and the usual chaos of a wizarding school, he found himself feeling stretched thin. Even the lack of Quidditch, girlfriends, or murderous Dark Wizards didn\u2019t make him feel any freer than in previous years.\nThere were a few things that he always made time for, though.\nFirstly, naturally, was spending enough time with Hermione and Ron, specifically the latter. Hermione seemed happy enough to snuggle with Ron, check on Harry, and otherwise give him his space, but they\u2019d spent such an intense time together the previous year that Harry was fairly certain their souls were as entwined as two could be short of one being a Horcrux. They didn\u2019t need hours together to understand each other\u2019s needs; a weary look or a tight smile or a reassuring nod could do the job just as nicely.\nBut Ron was Harry\u2019s roommate; Ron came from a large, sociable family; Ron still battled insecurities about his position in their trio regularly; Ron had more of an explosive temper when feeling slighted. So Harry made sure they hung out to do nothing together at least on a weekly basis to avoid being pummeled with a pillow again.\nSecondly, he made sure to write to Eltanin daily. More and more often it was just a quick hello/good-night before bed with real conversation happening on the weekends as they caught up on each other\u2019s lives\u2014or rather, as Eltanin caught up on Harry\u2019s. The French student remained stubbornly reticent about his personal life, but he did relax enough over the months to reveal that he was an only child, didn\u2019t have many friends, did enough schoolwork to rival Hermione, and enjoyed Conjuration, heights, and flying and hated Herbology and Divinations. He also revealed a knack for terribly drawn but hilariously crass doodles.\nThirdly, Harry made time for Malfoy. His schedule always seemed to serendipitously open up when Malfoy was around and amenable to a visit.\nWhat a coincidence.\nIf the weather was agreeable and the pitch was empty, they flew more often than not; if there were too many students out of doors or they were both feeling antisocial, they\u2019d sit in a corner of the library to read or study and pretend the company was mere coincidence. Once in a while, Harry would notice Malfoy sitting alone in a courtyard or alcove, go fetch a game from his room, and return, and they\u2019d lose a few hours over Wizard\u2019s Chess, Gobstones, or Exploding Snap.\nMalfoy stubbornly resisted at first, of course. That never stopped Harry from trying again, and his efforts gradually paid off; over the course of February and March, Malfoy slowly but steadily refused his overtures less and less.\nRon thought he was barmy for wanting to be friends with Malfoy. Hermione loudly fussed and quietly worried, but she also seemed to better understand, if the furtive glances she sometimes cast their ex-rival\u2019s way were any indication.\n\n\n\nIn April, the status quo between Harry and Malfoy shifted again. This time, it wasn\u2019t even Harry\u2019s doing.\nThey were flying over the Forbidden Forest near the mountains when the winds hit. They\u2019d noticed the grey clouds upon heading out, but any actual rain seemed far off and unimportant. After years of Quidditch, a bit of weather wasn\u2019t about to scare them off.\nUntil the bit of weather decided to turn into a full-blown thunderstorm racing in and taking up residence right over the school.\nWhen a particularly sharp gale nearly knocked Harry from his broom, they gestured at each to land, unable to hear themselves over the pounding precipitation. Most of the descent went fine as they headed for the edge of the forest to take cover under the trees, but just as Harry dismounted, another sharp wind snuck up on them. Draco was blown off his broom, although he just barely managed to keep his grip on the handle and keep it from flying off into the forest. Unable to maintain his balance against the wind\u2019s momentum, he tripped and toppled over the moment his feet hit the ground.\nLuckily, Harry was there to cushion his fall.\nUnluckily, it wasn\u2019t on purpose.\nHarry managed to turn just in time for Draco to hit and knock them both over. His arse absorbed most of the impact, and the soil was muddy enough to soften the landing when his head splashed down into the wet earth next. He didn\u2019t have much thought to spare to be grateful, though, when he found himself with an armful of Slytherin.\nMalfoy let out an impressive stream of colourful language upon impact, but he didn\u2019t immediately get up. Harry could understand that; all the air had been knocked from his lungs, and he imagined Malfoy was experiencing the same. They were cold and drenched and sore, and he was pretty sure he had mud in places that mud absolutely did not belong, so he certainly wasn\u2019t about to complain about the lack of immediate movement.\nThe Shift happened about forty-two seconds in. Harry\u2019s breathing was almost back to normal\u2014and, incidentally and fascinatingly, nearly in sync with the rise and fall of the other man\u2019s chest\u2014when Malfoy tried to roll off of him to sit up.\nThe Shift started when Malfoy propped himself up with his hands on either side of Harry, thereby reallocating the majority of his weight downwards, and oh\u2014\nThe Shift went into full effect when Malfoy collapsed back down onto him with a pained cry.\n\u201cWhat? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d Harry distantly heard himself ask. He was concerned, naturally, but it was admittedly more than a little bit an automated response; most of his attention had abruptly rerouted itself to the peculiar sensation of being pinned down by a familiar, non-threatening weight and the way he could smell Malfoy\u2019s cologne or shampoo or natural scent over the rush of rainwater.\n\u201cI twisted my ankle,\u201d Malfoy muttered through gritted teeth. \u201cGive me a second.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Harry replied distractedly, breathless all over again.\nA second turned into two turned into twenty turned into an eternity. Harry lost track. He couldn\u2019t say how long they lay there in the rain.\nHe could say\u2014at length\u2014how Malfoy\u2019s hair glowed when backlit by rain and cracks of lightning, and how he smelled like parchment and leather oil and a little like mint, and how his flat chest lined up so neatly against Harry\u2019s own, and how his weight was just enough for Harry to feel trapped but not enough to be uncomfortable, and how striking his warm breath felt against the rain-chilled skin of Harry\u2019s neck.\nOnce Malfoy\u2019s ankle presumably stopped throbbing enough for him to move, he did. Harry continued to lie in the mud long enough for Malfoy to give him a confused look. \u201cAre you okay? Did I hurt you?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? No. No, I\u2019m fine,\u201d Harry reassured after another moment\u2019s delay as he tried to screw his head back on and stop hyperfocusing on the way his heart was beating too quickly. All he could think about was that he needed to talk to Eltanin, and fast.\nTrying to deflect from his odd behaviour, Harry pulled off his glasses to wipe some of the rain from his eyes and gave an exaggeratedly bright smile. \u201cAre you worried about me? I feel like we\u2019ve officially reached the next stage of friendship.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not friends,\u201d Malfoy bit back so immediately it was clearly reflex. Catching the idiocy of his own statement as they sat there in the mud, drenched in rain, after spending the last hour flying together and exchanging insults and avoiding their peers, his expression shifted to one of disgruntlement.\nHarry burst out laughing. After a moment, Malfoy\u2014no, Draco\u2014joined in.\n\n\n\nI think I\u2019m in trouble.\n\n\n\nBy the time Eltanin responded, Harry\u2019d chewed off most of his fingernails and cuticles over the night. The journal lay open on his chest, propped up for him to see despite the fact that Eltanin was undoubtedly sleeping like a sane person.\nOh, Merlin. What now?\nHarry nearly fell off the bed in his haste to grab his pen and write back. Ron obliviously snored on.\nI think you were right.\nI generally am. But pray tell, what about?\nI think I fancy him.\nI love how you think I\u2019m able to guess who, out of all the complete strangers that are your friends, you are referring to with that masculine pronoun.\nBut you can, can\u2019t you?\nUnfortunately. That poor bloke you\u2019ve been bullying into being your friend?\nYeah. I don\u2019t know what to do.\nWhat do you want?\nI don\u2019t know.\nYou must have some idea. Do you want it to fade? Do you want to date him? Do you want to experiment and move on? Is this bi-curiosity? Or did you catch him playing Quidditch and get confused, because I still think you\u2019re Snitchsexual more than anything?\nHA. No. No, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m confused. We had an accident the other day where he fell on me, and Merlin, I couldn\u2019t think about anything but how he felt and smelled and looked. It could have been hailing for all I cared. Actually, the weather was awful enough that it really might have. And now I can\u2019t stop thinking about him.\nYou were doing a piss-poor job of not thinking about him before, honestly.\nYou do call me a stalker. I\u2019ve got to live up to expectations, don\u2019t I?\nWell, you certainly do a bang-up job of it. So, what do you want?\nI don\u2019t know. I mean, I only just got him to finally sort of admit that we\u2019re friends, and then I go and fancy him? I can\u2019t imagine dating him, or dating any bloke, but I like being around him. We spent so long at each other\u2019s throats that there\u2019s no need for pretenses, and I can relax around him in a way I usually only manage with my two best mates.\nYou can be attracted to your friends without wanting to date them, you know. Thinking they\u2019re fit doesn\u2019t have to change anything.\nBut I\u2019m worried that it will. It\u2019s like I opened Pandora\u2019s box, and now I can\u2019t stop thinking about it.\n:(\nHahaha!\nWell, I can\u2019t really give you advice (that you\u2019ll ignore) if I don\u2019t know what your goal is, so I\u2019d say to figure out what you want first, and then we\u2019ll talk. It\u2019s entirely possible it\u2019s just a physical reaction, and the novelty is what\u2019s distracting you.\nYeah, you may be right.\nThink on it, okay?\nSounds good.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s not just a physical reaction. I think maybe it\u2019s not as new as I\u2019d thought, either?\nGood morning to you, too. What makes you think that?\nMy friend hitting me with a scroll at breakfast and telling me to stop staring at him and eat. Apparently I missed my mouth while trying to drink my juice.\nAre you serious?\nSadly, yes. Even more sadly, this isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve done that.\nYou\u2019re adorable. Okay. What do you want to do?\nI don\u2019t know. Dating him would be so weird, especially given where we come from. There would definitely be a lot of opposition from our friends if we did. And most importantly, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s even interested in men anyway. He had the same girlfriend almost all through school.\nAre you sure you\u2019re not making assumptions again? Especially if, based on things you\u2019ve said about him in the past, his business is usually public, he may just keep non-heterosexual dalliances discreet. And maybe there was another reason for why he had the same girlfriend for so long. It\u2019s atypical for such a young relationship to last years, after all.\nThat\u2019s possible. But then it\u2019s even scarier. Although I guess it doesn\u2019t matter. He\u2019s barely willing to be friends, so why would he want to be more? And besides, even if he weren\u2019t straight, I\u2019m really not his type.\nAssumptions. If he\u2019s been discreet, you wouldn\u2019t really know what his type is, would you?\nBased on his friends? Sarcastic, proud, wealthy, and very selective of who they choose to grace with their company. Aside from the ones who were more like pets or bodyguards, also generally good looking.\nHarry, if corresponding with you these last eight months has taught me anything about you, it\u2019s that you\u2019re very sarcastic, proud, and selective of who to grace with your company. You are also your own guardian and have a house so I\u2019m guessing you have more money than you talk about, and two-thirds of looking good is just knowing how to groom. Unless you mean you\u2019re horribly disfigured or something, natural features matter less than people think it does.\nThat\u2019s what you think. After dealing with the war last year, I\u2019m still sort of scrawny, my hair is actually untameable, my glasses are dorky, and at best I look boringly ordinary. I\u2019m not in the best condition to attract someone right now.\nUnless they want me for my name, Harry resentfully did not write. He was so lucky to have grown up with his friends for long enough that they didn\u2019t give him special treatment. The younger students had gotten over most of the idol worship they\u2019d picked up again at the start of the school year, but it was nothing compared to going anywhere else in the wizarding world\u2014even Hogsmeade. He couldn\u2019t wait to drop off the public radar and be allowed to mind his own business again.\nThis was one of the reasons he was so grateful for Eltanin\u2019s company. Harry knew he\u2019d let slip enough over the months that Eltanin possibly had some guess as to who he was, or eventually would, but the other man never acted on it or conversed with him differently for it.\nOrdinary is fine. Ordinary can be improved upon when circumstances call for it. And you\u2019ll put on weight again if you keep eating and flying. The outside is not that important. You already voluntarily spend time with each other over most of the rest of your peers, so I\u2019d say that\u2019s not a bad start.\nA bad start to what?\nTo whatever or wherever you want to pursue this, friendship or otherwise.\nDo you really think I\u2019ve got a chance?\nYou\u2019re a good person, Harry. If he likes you enough to go from being your enemy to your friend and he\u2019s interested in men but doesn\u2019t give you a chance, he\u2019s a blind fool.\nYou don\u2019t know that.\nYes, I do. I definitely do.\n\n\n\nHarry was losing his mind.\nSpilling his juice at breakfast was only the start of the story. Through the rest of the month, it seemed like Draco was everywhere, and about twelve times more distracting than he\u2019d already been.\nBreakfast was a lost cause when he had a direct line of sight to the way Draco would absently twirl a butter knife in his dexterous fingers while snickering at something Blaise or one of the other remaining Slytherins had said. Harry wound up with more food down his front than he would have in a Weasley family food fight.\nIn Transfigurations, Draco had taken (or maybe he\u2019d always been prone) to chewing on his lower lip as he thought, neat, white line of teeth worrying at and reddening the skin. Harry missed the rock he was supposed to transfigure into a rabbit and accidentally gave Neville a puffy tail instead.\nIn Potions, Draco leaned back idly in his seat during lectures, brushing the feather of his quill back and forth over his lips and cheek as he awaited lab time. Harry missed about two-thirds of the instructions and started a fire in his cauldron that singed Hermione\u2019s hair.\nHarry even spotted him in the library several times, backlit by a window as he read. Draco\u2019s version of reading seemed to involve tipping back in his chair so that his long, lean legs were kicked up on the table, nibbling obliviously on a knuckle and occasionally smirking to himself, entertained by the words on the page. Harry tripped over his own foot and went crashing into a bookshelf, dropping his homework and tearing his Herbology essay in half in the process.\nDraco became more reckless on a broom, daring Harry to fly higher, farther, pulling more and more ridiculous stunts in their eternal one-up game. (Harry successfully managed to avoid hurting himself these times. Then again, that was most likely due to being midair without anything to run into, drop, set on fire, transfigure, spill, choke on, or otherwise destroy.)\nAnd then there was the closet incident...\n\n\n\nMay first would forever mark the closet incident.\nIt started out as a normal Monday. The students had breakfast (Harry accidentally stabbed himself in the hand with his fork while watching Draco drink milk), went to classes (Harry avoided causing any\u2026 permanent\u2026 damage), had dinner (Harry didn\u2019t notice Ginny steal his beloved treacle tart, and hadn\u2019t that caused a round of exaggerated shocked gasps), and did homework in the library (Harry obsessively checked his journal in hopes of a response while pretending he wasn\u2019t looking around for Draco).\nIn late evening, they very nearly tripped over each other in the corridors. Harry began to ask what Draco was up to when the blond clapped a hand over his mouth, fervently hissing \u201cShhh! Filch is around here somewhere.\u201d\nDistracted by the feeling of Draco\u2019s broom-calloused skin, it took Harry a moment to process the warning. He nodded in acknowledgement, and Draco removed his hand in order to grab his sleeve and drag him down the way Harry\u2019d just come. \u201cHe was just here\u2014probably just let Mrs. Norris loose. We\u2019ve got to find a place to hide.\u201d\nHarry thought fast. \u201cOne of the unused potions labs is back this way,\u201d he whispered. \u201cThe lock was broken the last I looked.\u201d\nDraco nodded and let Harry take the lead. The lock to the small lab was indeed still broken, and they vanished inside just as Mrs. Norris padded around the corner, sniffing the air suspiciously.\nFollowing their scents to the door, she meowed loudly and pawed at it before dropping onto her side. She clawed at the wood a few times before swiping her paw underneath, mrrring victoriously at the sharp \u201cOw!\u201d that came from inside.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you get for crawling around on the floor like an animal,\u201d Draco hissed.\n\u201cI was looking for Filch!\u201d Harry hissed back as he wiped the little dots of blood off of his nose.\n\u201cYou were looking like an idiot!\u201d\n\u201cShhh, he\u2019s coming!\u201d\n\u201cWhat have we here, my sweet?\u201d Filch\u2019s voice wafted through the door, as grating and vindictive as ever. Mrs. Norris yowled in response.\nHarry and Draco took the opportunity of Filch\u2019s slow, dragging step to scramble for the only other door in the room: the door to the narrow supply closet. As this lab was seldom accessed, the supply closet was fortunately unlocked; unfortunately, it was also still stocked. There was little quite as creepy as hiding among jars of unidentified body parts and mysterious fluids, holding one\u2019s breath against the distinctly noxious scent of formaldehyde.\nThe boys took one look at each other before taking deep breaths and diving in. Harry got the door shut and locked with a Colloportus just as Draco cast a Disillusionment Charm and something he\u2019d never heard of\u2014Avexi Something? Odus?\u2014over the both of them. Harry followed it up with a Silencing Charm.\nAnd they waited.\nAnd waited.\nThey could hear the door to the lab open. They exhaled, inhaled, resumed holding their breaths, and waited some more.\nFilch murmured to his cat. They exhaled, inhaled, resumed holding their breaths, and waited some more.\nMrs. Norris pawed at various spots around the room, mrrring again in dissatisfaction. Harry winced as the shelf digging into his back reached the point of Impossible to Ignore and leaned away from it. Draco inhaled sharply and smacked the side of his head, and they waited some more.\nMrs. Norris clawed at their door, then moved on. Draco slowly let out a breath and relaxed his entire body. This time, it was Harry\u2019s turn to inhale sharply, but Draco didn\u2019t react. They waited some more.\nThe closet door swung open.\nHarry and Draco grabbed at each other before Filch came into sight, peering into the darkness. Harry silently prayed that the Disillusionment was enough to keep the groundskeeper from reaching in and poking around.\nFilch crinkled his nose. He leaned in just enough to make Harry and Draco lean away, huffed in frustration, and drew back. Slamming the closet door shut, he shuffled off. \u201cCome along, Mrs. Norris. They must be around here somewhere. We\u2019ll find them yet!\u201d\nNeither student moved for a full minute after the main door to the lab shut. Draco was the first to crack, letting out a sigh of relief and dropping his forehead against Harry\u2019s shoulder as he slumped. \u201cHow is it we just went through a bloody war, but the idea of getting caught out past curfew by Filch still scares the sorcery out of me?\u201d he grumbled.\n\u201cHabit?\u201d Harry offered weakly. Now that the threat had passed, he was having trouble thinking of anything but how bloody close they were standing, and the fact that they were still clutching each other anxiously. \u201cI trust Hermione with my life, but her disappointed glare can still make me feel four years old.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t know her when you were four years old,\u201d Draco reminded.\n\u201cTell my crushing sense of shame that,\u201d Harry drawled.\nDraco laughed, and Harry shivered as the sound and breath traveled down his neck. His grip on the black material of Draco\u2019s robe tightened as he struggled not to make a sound or lean in closer. He couldn\u2019t, however, resist allowing his temple to rest against Draco\u2019s shoulder. That was okay, right? He was only mirroring the other man\u2019s position. That was safely platonic.\nLingering together in the dark while waiting for the last vestiges of panic to ebb was safely platonic.\nBreathing in time while clinging to each other was safely platonic.\nNot.\n\n\n\nAs soon as Harry got back to his room, he got undressed, grabbed the journal, and burrowed into his bed.\nI am in so much trouble.\nI highly doubt that.\nI\u2019m working on a paper so I\u2019ll be slow to reply, but feel free to rant.\nOkay. Good luck.\nAnd I am absolutely in trouble. There was an incident with the person I may or may not fancy. We were sort of stuck together for a few minutes. In a narrow, dark place. And I don\u2019t even know how to describe it. We didn\u2019t leave as soon as we could have. Should have? We just kind of stayed there a while. I don\u2019t know why. Nerves? I sort of felt like I was losing my mind.\nDid something happen?\nYeah, we were out past curfew and the groundskeeper nearly caught us.\nNo, I meant did something happen between the two of you.\nOh. No. I mean\u2026 no.\nThat sounds less like \u201cno\u201d and more like \u201csort of, but I don\u2019t want to say.\u201d\nI may have\u2026 had an inappropriate reaction. I don\u2019t think he noticed. If he did, he was polite enough not to react.\nTrue to his word, it was a good quarter hour before Eltanin replied. Harry tried not to fret; homework came first, after all. Although what Eltanin was doing homework at this hour of the night for was a mystery...\nYou were in a narrow space? I\u2019d say it\u2019s a little difficult for a bloke not to notice when another bloke is feeling frisky for him.\nI\u2019m hoping the adrenaline of the situation either distracted him or excused me.\nWhat would you have done if he\u2019d commented on it?\nDied of embarrassment, probably?\nHaha. Other than that.\nMerlin, I don\u2019t know. It probably would have depended on what he said and how he said it.\nIf he was not disagreeable?\nNot disagreeable doesn\u2019t mean actively interested. It could just mean he\u2019s polite and not homophobic.\nIf he hinted that he was actively interested?\nGod, I don\u2019t know how to do this. My first girlfriend and I were horribly awkward, and my second girlfriend and I got together on an adrenaline rush. I don\u2019t know how other people negotiate their relationships.\nSo you want a relationship now?\nAs opposed to?\nNot a casual shag sort of guy, then?\nEr. No. Not really. I mean, maybe if the last couple of years hadn\u2019t been so chaotic and miserable and I\u2019d had a normal school life, but. No. I don\u2019t think so.\nAll right. So you want a relationship with this bloke, then? Or you want to wait it out in hopes that the inappropriate reactions stop happening?\nThe first one. I think. I still can\u2019t wrap my mind around what it would be like to date him, and external variables will definitely make things difficult, but I think it would be worth it to try. Although I can\u2019t imagine how the topic would ever come up\u2026 And I still think he would be horrified if he knew this was how I thought of him.\nHe won\u2019t be horrified. I promise you that.\nWhat makes you say that?\nNo response came.\nEltanin? Are you just trying to be encouraging?\nA few minutes later, Harry got impatient with waiting and tried again.\nAre you asleep, or are you really still working on homework? It has to be what, nearly 2AM there?\nI have to tell you something.\nYeah?\nYou\u2019re going to be angry with me.\nWhat about?\nI\u2019m desperately hoping that you\u2019ll be as forgiving of me as you are of your ex-rival-turned-closet-crush, although I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s not likely. Please bear in mind that I really never in a thousand years expected us to keep corresponding for this long.\nYou\u2019re starting to scare me. What is it?\nI\u2026 didn\u2019t explicitly lie to you, but I let a deliberate misunderstanding go on for too long.\nHarry\u2019s stomach sank. Eltanin knew him well enough by now to know that he didn\u2019t exactly have an unreasonable temper. If Eltanin thought he\u2019d be angry, there was probably a good reason for it. But what could he possibly have lied about?\nWhat, are you secretly a girl?\nWhat? No, why would I lie about my gender?\nAre you actually a creepy old man?\nOf course not!\nAre you not really French? Got a German chin, do you?\nAbout that...\nYou\u2019re not French?\nI am. Sort of. One half of my family is originally French, anyway. And I really was in France when you were first trying to figure out where I was.\nWas in France. But you\u2019re not now?\nNo.\nOh, Merlin.\nYes.\nYou go to Hogwarts.\nYes.\nHarry felt like he was going to be sick. Had Eltanin been manipulating him all this time? But he hadn\u2019t done or said anything that caused Harry trouble, and in fact, routinely argued and got exasperated with him.\nYou know who I am?\nYou don\u2019t exactly make it difficult to guess.\nYou know Draco?\nOne could say so.\nWhat do you mean?\nI\u2019d rather tell you in person, if that\u2019s okay.\nActually, even if it\u2019s not okay, we really need to talk in person.\nFor a moment, Harry\u2019s stomach twisted in excited anticipation rather than anger. It was pure reflex; for months now Eltanin had been a constant for him, so of course he wanted to meet him. But then the reality of their current conversation came crashing back down on him.\nEltanin knew him. Knew him. Probably saw him in the corridors or the Great Hall. Maybe he\u2019d told his friends about what a pathetic idiot Harry was, confiding in a diary despite how much trouble Riddle\u2019s diary had gotten everyone into. If he was a seventh year, he probably had classes with Ginny and Luna\u2014hell, maybe he was even housemates with one of them.\nMaybe he was housemates with Harry. He didn\u2019t read like a Gryffindor, but Harry knew better than to rely on house stereotypes anymore.\nHe began to write again, hand scrawling quickly, letters sharp and furious. He wasn\u2019t even sure if his writing was legible, but at the moment, he didn\u2019t really care.\nYou\u2019ve been lying to me for nine months? You let me natter at you like we were strangers and it was safe! I wouldn\u2019t have said anything I said if I knew you were here! I listened to you\u2014I liked you! I\u2019d been planning to go out to France this summer to meet you! I nearly sent you a letter by owl post\u2014in fact, I should have, so Reuben would have flown straight to you! Now you tell me you\u2019ve been lying to me for almost a year? What else have you lied about?\nI tried not to lie. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t say much about myself. And I guessed it was you, but I wasn\u2019t sure at first. I thought I was being paranoid and reading into things too much. I almost stopped talking to you a dozen times because this was too strange and I felt guilty. I didn\u2019t even like you at the beginning of the year, but you kept writing to me whether I responded or not.\nWhy did you do this? Why didn\u2019t you tell me at the beginning?\nHe underlined \u201cat the beginning\u201d thrice before slamming his pen down.\nThere was no immediate reply. Harry assumed Eltanin was putting his thoughts together. He wouldn\u2019t just disappear now like a complete coward, would he? The mere thought of being left hanging after all of this made Harry curl up more tightly, trying to hold onto the hot flash of anger in his chest, trying not to give in to the stupid, ridiculous urge to cry.\nWhen the response came, it wasn\u2019t as neat as Eltanin\u2019s usual writing. It varied between quick, messy scrawling, abrupt stops, and slow, careful lettering. Harry felt a stab of vindictive pleasure that Eltanin was clearly upset, but it was immediately followed by a sharp pang of guilt that the thought had ever crossed his mind.\nAt first it was because I didn\u2019t expect to keep writing with you anyway. I wanted to see what you were really like without other people around to influence us. And after that\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I changed my mind. I was afraid that if you knew, you would stop responding. I liked you more and more. I liked arguing with you. I liked giving you suggestions and waiting to see how you\u2019d blow them off and what you would do instead. I liked hearing events we both experienced from your perspective. I told you I didn\u2019t have many friends\u2026 truth is, I\u2019m not sure I even really have one. Our correspondences became something I wanted to keep, and keep private. And then I started to really like you, more than I should have. The way you like Draco. I kept hoping it would go away, but it didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t think it ever will.\nHarry\u2019s head spun while he tried to process that. Eltanin liked him? Eltanin fancied him? He\u2019d never guessed. And to think he\u2019d just been happy that the other boy tolerated their penpal arrangement at all\u2026 But now that very happiness felt like a lie. Their entire friendship felt like a lie. How much of it had been real? Did Eltanin really think of him that way\u2014and so seriously\u2014or was this just more hero worship for Harry to have to worry about?\nWhich possibility would be worse?\nAre you really a seventh year, or was that another thing I guessed and you let me believe?\nI\u2019m in your year.\nGroaning, Harry pushed the journal away for a moment and wrapped the blankets tighter around himself. He was half-tempted to wake Ron to complain, but he was pretty sure Ron\u2019s preoccupation would be with the fact that Harry\u2019d gone and gotten himself into more diary-related drama despite how badly the situation in second year had blown up. Also the fact that Harry\u2019d been writing with this secret friend all year. Also the fact that Harry was in a bloody love triangle, and that it involved Draco Malfoy and said secret friend.\nHarry pulled the journal back.\nFuck. Who are you?\nCan we talk about this in person?\nYou know I can\u2019t reciprocate. I can\u2019t even trust you right now.\nI know. That\u2019s exactly why we should talk about this in person, so all the cards are on the table.\nWhere and when?\nTomorrow after dinner. I\u2019ll meet you in the library.\nWhere in the library?\nWherever you want. I\u2019ll find you.\nWhy won\u2019t you tell me who you are now?\nBecause I\u2019m scared to death that you won\u2019t show up if I do.\nI\u2019ll show up. I keep my promises.\nI know you do. Please?\nFine. But after this, I really don\u2019t know that we can be friends.\nI know. I know this will probably all go to hell. But I need to talk to you anyway. You deserve the entire truth.\nDid you get me this diary on purpose?\nNo. I actually still have absolutely no idea how you ended up with it. I thought the only surviving copies were with my family. Apparently there was another one floating around in the world.\nFine.\nWe should try and get some sleep. And I know you have no reason to believe me, and you\u2019ll likely hate me come our meeting tomorrow, but if you can believe anything I\u2019ve said, believe that I really do care about you.\nI cared about you, too.\nGood night, Harry.\n\n\n\nThe next day, Harry was an absolute mess. While it was mostly Eltanin\u2019s fault, however, some of it could not be blamed on him.\nHe\u2019d been so distracted with both N.E.W.T.s and Draco recently that he\u2019d somehow managed to completely miss that the second of May marked exactly one year since the Battle of Hogwarts. All around the school, students and professors were quiet and somber. Morning classes were let out early, and afternoon classes were canceled altogether in honour of a memorial held in the Great Hall. Many students attended; many others couldn\u2019t bear to.\nFor obvious reasons, Draco wasn\u2019t there.\nHarry stuck close to Ron and Hermione and Ginny. About halfway through the memorial, however, he began to feel the itch of too many stares. When the urge to escape became overwhelming, he gave Ron\u2019s shoulder a squeeze, Hermione a hug, and Ginny\u2019s hair a kiss before heading out.\nHe passed Luna on the way. \u201cHello, Harry,\u201d she greeted in her light, airy way. \u201cWhat a lovely day for remembrance.\u201d\n\u201cI guess,\u201d Harry agreed noncommittally, wearing a tight smile. \u201cGinny\u2019s up near the front left, if you were going to look for her.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Luna replied. \u201cAnd Malfoy\u2019s in the rear of the library, if you were going to look for him.\u201d\nHarry came to a dead stop. He turned, blinking at the fey girl. \u201cWait\u2014why did you tell me that?\u201d\nAlready mid-step, Luna paused and peered back over her shoulder. \u201cAren\u2019t you usually looking for him?\u201d\nHarry\u2019s stomach sank. Was it that obvious?\nLuna turned to face him again. \u201cOh. You\u2019re upset,\u201d she observed.\n\u201cI-I. Is. Um,\u201d Harry croaked. He ran a hand through his hair anxiously. \u201cHow many people think that?\u201d\nTilting her head, Luna hummed as she considered. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not sure. I think we\u2019re all just used to it.\u201d\n\u201cUsed to it?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yes,\u201d Luna nodded slowly. \u201cYou\u2019ve been watching each other for years, after all. It\u2019s nothing new, even if the way you look at each other has changed.\u201d\nHarry stared at her.\nLuna smiled. \u201cHave a good evening, Harry.\u201d She slipped into the Great Hall, letting the door softly shut behind her.\nHarry ran for the library.\n\n\n\nWhen he got there, Harry found Draco curled up in his niche. His eyes were closed, but there was a quill in his hand and a book on his lap.\n\u201cAre you really doing homework right now?\u201d he asked as he approached, wincing when the blond jumped in surprise at his voice. \u201cSorry about that.\u201d\nDraco eyed him uneasily.\nHarry was startled to find bags under his eyes, his pale skin even paler, worry lines creasing his brow. The questions he\u2019d wanted to ask\u2014mostly along the lines of a hopefully better worded \u201cHow do you look at me?\u201d\u2014vanished at the sight. \u201cAre you okay\u2026?\u201d he asked, settling down in the niche. There really wasn\u2019t enough space for two, but he nudged Malfoy\u2019s curled legs back into the space until he could just barely perch there.\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be at the memorial?\u201d Draco asked, throat rasping slightly from disuse. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\n\u201cLuna mentioned you were here,\u201d Harry explained. \u201cI wanted to see how you were doing. It\u2019s\u2026 not really a day to be alone, I think.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d\nAs the silence began to feel uncomfortable, Harry\u2019s concern grew. It had been a while now since they were so awkward with each other. \u201cDo you\u2026 want me to leave?\u201d he offered hesitantly. \u201cI mean, I know it\u2019s a rough day and all\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Draco interrupted sharply, much to Harry\u2019s immediate relief. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not\u2014it\u2019s not about what happened last year. Really. I\u2019d\u2026 it\u2019s unforgivable of me, but I\u2019d actually forgotten what the date was. I\u2019ve just got some things on my mind.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, me, too,\u201d Harry agreed. \u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d\nDraco took a deep breath and looked down, fidgeting with his quill. \u201cNo, I really don\u2019t. But we need to.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018We\u2019?\u201d Harry echoed. His stomach gave a nervous twist. Draco needed to talk to him? About something that was clearly making him anxious and lose sleep?\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nWas it possible that what Luna\u2019d hinted at was right?\n\u201cAbout\u2026?\u201d\nWas it possible that Eltanin was ri\u2014\n\nEltanin!\n\nAs Draco continued to avoid meeting his eyes and playing with his book, another terrible thought occurred to Harry.\nNo. It couldn\u2019t be. There was no way. The coincidence was too improbable. And it hadn\u2019t sounded like him at all, and surely he would have said something\u2026?\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d have more time,\u201d Draco began slowly in the hushed tones of a guilty confession. \u201cI thought you\u2019d stay at the memorial, and then go to dinner, and maybe I\u2019d figure out what to say by the time you got here.\u201d\nDinner.\nThe library.\nHarry looked down at the book that Draco nervously toyed with.\nA thin leather book, about five by seven inches at its widest points, an inconsistent shape, and looking like something a five year old had put together on an idle evening.\nHarry stared down at it in shock. \u201cNo.\u201d\nDraco flinched.\nJerking away, Harry bolted to the bookshelves that shielded them from the rest of the library. He ran a hand through his hair as he turned his back to the other man, feeling his face heat up in embarrassment. He was horrified\u2014he was angry, of course\u2014but more than anything else, he was mortified.\nHe\u2019d known. Draco\u2019d known every damn thing Harry\u2019d thought and said about him. He\u2019d known about Harry\u2019s uncertainty before they\u2019d started spending time together, he\u2019d known about Harry\u2019s desire to be friends, and he\u2019d known about Harry\u2019s stupid crush.\nIf he hadn\u2019t known about Harry\u2019s reaction to the closet incident before, he certainly knew now.\nOh, Merlin, he\u2019d probably been laughing at Harry this entire time! Hell, he was the one who\u2019d called Harry a stalker. How many times had he taken the piss out of Harry for obsessing over Draco? How many people had he told? Nobody had come to harass Harry yet, but it was probably just a matter of time\u2014\nExcept\u2026 that wasn\u2019t quite right.\nIt had never felt like taking the piss. And his friendship with Draco had been left alone to develop slowly and organically. Not even Hermione and Ron had given him much trouble about it after the initial \u201cHave you gone mad?\u201d arguments, and not a single Slytherin had so much as smirked his way all year. \u201cEltanin\u201d hadn\u2019t once come across as malicious. In fact, if anything, he\u2019d consistently erred on the side of caution and restraint.\nCome to think of it, \u201cEltanin\u201d had been giving him advice all along.\n\u201cEltanin\u201d had alternately discouraged and encouraged him, depending on the course of action he\u2019d intended to take. \u201cEltanin\u201d had tried to get him to leave Draco alone back when Draco\u2019d been entirely resistant to friendship. \u201cEltanin\u201d had suggested he take things slow and quiet, keep their changing dynamic out of the public eye. \u201cEltanin\u201d had advised him to observe what traits he was attracted to without ever rushing or belittling him. \u201cEltanin\u201d had told him again and again not to rely entirely on his own assumptions.\n\u201cEltanin\u201d was interested in men.\n\u201cEltanin\u201d had promised that Draco wouldn\u2019t be horrified to know how he felt.\n\u201cEltanin\u201d cared about him, fancied him, in a way he didn\u2019t think would go away.\n\u201cEltanin\u201d was terrified that Harry would hate him after their meeting.\n\nDraco liked him.\n\nYes, Draco had been lying to him all year, and Harry was angry about that; he would continue to be angry about that. They were going to be having some significant trust issues for a while. But given the circumstances and knowing what Draco was like, Harry could sort of see why he\u2019d done it as well. And Draco hadn\u2019t said or done anything to hurt him, pressure him, or upset him\u2014he\u2019d used the anonymity to be surprisingly responsive and supportive, and in some ways, maybe even more honest than he would have been otherwise.\nThat didn\u2019t make everything okay, but it helped. The rest could come in time.\nHarry turned around and marched back before dropping down into the alcove again. His heart broke a little at the cornered look on Draco\u2019s face. \u201cDid you mean it?\u201d\nDraco flinched (again; they were really going to need to work on that). \u201cWhich part?\u201d he asked before shaking his head and hastily continuing, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. Yes. Except for the parts that were covering up who and where I was, yes, I meant everything I wrote.\u201d\nHarry smiled.\nDraco still looked like he expected Harry to take out his wand and hex him six ways to Sunday, but his shoulders marginally relaxed. \u201cYou\u2019re not\u2026 you don\u2019t hate me, then?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely mad at you,\u201d Harry corrected. \u201cWe\u2019ll probably have a proper row about this later, and I\u2019ll be upset off and on for a while. And you can\u2019t do this sort of thing again. But...\u201d He shrugged one shoulder. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be the one disgusted by me. I really didn\u2019t think\u2014as you know,\u201d he added mildly, this time deliberately trying to make Draco wince, \u201cthat I\u2019d ever have a chance with you. So I\u2019m angry at what you did, but finding out how you feel about me\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI love you,\u201d Draco blurted out.\nHarry\u2019s heart began pounding in earnest as he gaped. He knew Draco/Eltanin cared about him and was interested in him, but that was a bit\u2026 well, a bit more than he\u2019d been thinking.\nDraco took advantage of his stunned silence to continue, leaning forward. \u201cIn case it wasn\u2019t clear last night. I\u2019m so sorry. By the time I cared enough to not want to lie, it had been long enough that I didn\u2019t know how to back out. I was scared of messing everything up. But I really do care about you.\u201d\nHarry\u2019s smile widened. \u201cYou can\u2019t backtrack like that. Which is it\u2014you love me or you only care about me?\u201d he teased.\n\u201cI love you,\u201d Draco responded again without hesitation. \u201cI know you\u2019re still working some things out, and I know your feelings aren\u2019t that strong, and I\u2019m not going to push you to commit to anything, but\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot,\u201d Harry announced. \u201cI already thought of Eltanin as one of my best friends, and I\u2019ve been spending more time with you lately than anyone else. Knowing you\u2019re the same person is like having the best of both worlds rolled into one. Yeah, I don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m doing or what a relationship with you would look like, but we\u2019ve already seen each other at our worsts, and it\u2019s amazing how far we\u2019ve already come in less than a year. We can make it work.\u201d He stopped as a thought occurred to him. \u201cI mean, if you want to. Feelings are one thing, but I know there\u2019s a lot of bad blood between your family and me, and I don\u2019t want to make things difficult for you.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a tradition on mum\u2019s side to fall for someone the family hates anyway,\u201d Draco shrugged. \u201cWhat\u2019s the worst that can happen? Father has to be on good behaviour now, and mum won\u2019t care so long as I\u2019m safe and happy. You\u2019re the one with a lot to lose, getting tangled up with the likes of me.\u201d\nFor a moment, Harry was too distracted to respond.\n\u201cOther kind of tangling,\u201d Draco drawled.\nHarry blushed. \u201cAm I really that obvious?\u201d\n\u201cLittle bit,\u201d Draco admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s cute.\u201d When Harry\u2019s blush darkened, Draco laughed and held out an arm invitingly. \u201cCome here.\u201d\nThe niche wasn\u2019t really large enough to hold the both of them, but Harry went anyway. If he had to drape half over Draco to avoid falling off, well, neither of them were about to complain\u2026 and the kiss Draco welcomed him with was well worth the effort.\n\n\n\nHey.\nHi!\nWhy aren\u2019t you sleeping? We\u2019ve got a busy day tomorrow.\nWhy aren\u2019t you?\nNervous.\nAbout graduating?\nAbout what comes next.\nWe talked about this? We\u2019ll get jobs, eventually move in together, and live happily ever after. :)\nHaha.\nShould I be offended that you\u2019re laughing at the idea of happily ever after with me?\nNope. I\u2019m laughing at the idea that it\u2019d be so neat and tidy.\nNothing worth having is ever easy.\nMy parents would beg to differ.\nYour parents are an exception. They fell in love when they were like twelve...\nAnd they\u2019re still utterly soppy, which is why they\u2019d beg to differ. Also, they\u2019re going to be there tomorrow.\nThey ARE?\nYes. Mum arranged a Firecall today with the school to tell me.\nWhy\u2019d she Firecall instead of just sending an Owl?\nShe had a confession to make.\nWhat sort of confession?\nThe diary you\u2019re using is hers.\nWHAT?\nYeah. Apparently there were three diaries that were custom-made for her and my aunts. Aunt Bellatrix burned Andromeda\u2019s after she married Tonks and left hers behind when she married LeStrange. When mum saw that I\u2019d found Bella\u2019s diary and started using it, she dug out hers and had one of our elves place it at the bookstore. She was tired of seeing me mope about the Manor and wanted me to find someone to talk to. I guess she thought I\u2019d find it easier with a stranger.\nWow. That\u2019s\u2026 really meddling and a little creepy, but also weirdly sweet? And she had good intentions?\nYes. At least it ended well, but I was not exactly pleased. She\u2019s also demanding credit for our getting together.\nI thought she didn\u2019t like me?\nShe thinks you\u2019re rude and uncouth, but she doesn\u2019t otherwise have a strong opinion on you one way or another.\nI assume your father still hates me, though.\nJust as much as you hate him.\nBut he\u2019s still coming to the ceremony tomorrow?\nYes.\nThat\u2019s good? You want him there, right?\nSo long as the two of you don\u2019t try to kill each other.\nI can\u2019t speak for your dad, but I\u2019ll be on good behaviour so long as he is.\nWe\u2019ll see. He\u2019s not fond of public family fights, so he\u2019ll probably save the drama for when we\u2019re back at the Manor.\nBut you\u2019re still coming to the Black house after, right?\nYep.\nYour dad won\u2019t change your mind?\nNope.\nYou\u2019re sure?\nFor God\u2019s sake, Harry, I won\u2019t change my mind. I love you. I chose you. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\nUntil after the ceremony. After we get jobs, when we eventually move in together...\nAnd then yes, I suppose we\u2019ll live happily ever after.\n:)"
