There, he rights his wrongs and hires Tom Riddle as a Defense Professor to keep him from becoming Voldemort. It works. (Mostly.)

    "text": "There\u2019s something distinctly cult-like to all the muggle studies students. They cluck their tongues at students who don\u2019t take the elective and call them \u201cpoor things.\u201d Every single student taking muggle studies has a tell-tell harried look about them, a fanatical gleam in their eyes, and superiority clinging to the fabric of their clothes. \nMuggle-borns not taking the class often protest assertions from students that, \u201cMuggle Studies is easily the hardest class at Hogwarts!\u201d\nA sixth-year muggle-born, Tawny Dingle says, \u201cIt can\u2019t be if you already know about muggles! I mean what do you learn, what electricity is?\u201d\nHer sixth-year friend, a Hufflepuff who Tom Riddle never learned the name of, asserts, \u201cNot just what it is, but how it works! We\u2019re terribly behind you see, we were supposed to have learned about circuits ages ago and we can only take two days for science so we\u2019ll never catch up. Harry\u2019s just teaching us the very basics about Eddison, Tesla, and Alternating Current because what we really ought to be learning is Biology. Do you know why we need to breathe?\u201d\nTom\u2019s nose crinkles in distaste. Muggle-Studies is NOT supposed to garner this kind of fervor. He needs to know what is happening inside that classroom. Harry Potter, the new professor with wild black hair and emerald eyes somehow managed to get muggle studies into a two-hour daily class with optional evening sections and students keep showing up and Tom\u2019s had eight of his Slytherin students beg him to get them into the class. And Potter lets students call him Harry and he wears distressed jeans, v-neck cable-knit sweaters, and combat boots and is easily cool. Which is NOT what Muggle-Studies professors are supposed to be. It is an affront to Tom who unto the arrival of Harry Potter was the favourite professor. \nTom needs to be able to get into one of Harry\u2019s classes. For Observation. Of Course.\nDingle blinks, wide-eyed, \u201cWhy do we need to breathe? I know that. I mean yeah, to live.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut why does breathing help us live?\u201d The Hufflepuff pushes.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOxygen?\u201d'\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd what does Oxygen do?\u201d\n\u00a0\nDingle bows her head, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Hufflepuff adjusts her robes with the air of someone self-satisfied. \u201cOf course you don\u2019t. You\u2019re not taking Muggle-Studies. But to put you out of your miserable ignorance, it\u2019s because during aerobic cellular respiration, the glucose you store from food reacts in a chain ending with oxygen which produces Adenosine Triphosphate which is used as energy for all your living processes.\u201d \nTom Riddle frowns. He thinks of himself as being rather brilliant and he understands almost nothing from what the young Hufflepuff just said. \nA Slytherin hears the exchange and says, \u201cWell, I heard Potter\u2019s a squib.\u201d\nA third-year who clearly has also taken Muggle-Studies stands up and shouts, \u201cAnd what if he is?\u201d\nThis interests Tom greatly and for the next week, he spends all his time observing Harry Potter. The professor seems to own six different sweaters and three pairs of pants. Whenever it\u2019s foggy, the man will head to the kitchen and grab a slab of bleeding, juicy meat, thank crying houselves, and disappear to somewhere around the Quidditch pitch.\nHarry never uses magic. Not for grading papers (which he does with a pen on a notebook!), not for heating his tea, not for cleaning himself off. He may indeed be a squib. Disappointing and surprising. Tom cannot recruit him for later purposes. Yet\u2026 Tom cannot help but be impressed by how the man has managed to become so important to Hogwarts despite lacking magic. \nHarry Potter catches Tom following him one evening on his way to a class and flashes a bright smile. \n\u201cAh! Tom, would you like to sit it in my class today?\u201d\nTom initially begins a polite refusal, \u201cI\u2019d have to refu\u2013,\u201d but looking into Harry\u2019s (when did he become Harry?) sparkling eyes and remembering his desire to learn what exactly goes on in the muggle studies classes, he says, \u201cActually, yes. That would be excellent.\u201d \nHarry falls into step with Tom and they walk side-by-side to the muggle-studies classroom. The interior is filled with potted plants and wooden tables with sofas around them and a large blackboard. \nHarry settles himself comfortably sitting atop a desk at the front of the room. He pats the space beside and Tom sits down on the indicated spot stiffly. Harry\u2019s thighs are firm yet soft and he smells nice \u2013 like lemon with a hint of sandalwood. \nTom\u2019s face feels warm for reasons he cannot quite discern. \n\u201cYou\u2019re here for my favorite class,\u201d Harry says, voice warm and soft and sweet. Heat pools in the bottom of Tom\u2019s belly as Harry\u2019s breath ghosts over his ears. \u201cIB Economics with the seventh years.\u201d\nThe students filter in, all bright-eyed and bushy-tailed which they SHOULD NOT BE for an after-dinner optional course. They should be dead behind their eyes and drooping onto their desks. (Merlin knows sometimes kids fall asleep even in Tom's exciting Dark Arts lessons, and yet not a single child in Harry's class looks even remotely tired. Something is off here, something is very very wrong.) Harry peels off his sweater, revealing a tight grey shirt beneath. \nFor no reason at all, Tom wants to shrink Harry\u2019s discarded sweater down and put it in his pocket.\nHarry stands and Tom gets an excellent view of a well-muscled slim back and round bottom. Not that he is noticing such things. \n\u201cThe defense professor is joining us today in order to learn what we do, and I expect you all on your best behaviour. Where we last left our heroes we were discussing money theory, now can anyone tell me the money multiplier?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOne over the reserve ratio!\u201d The class choruses. \n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd what is the problem with banks in the Wizarding World?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThey do not have a reserve ratio,\u201d one student says. \n\u00a0\nHarry nods encouragingly. \u201cSomeone else, expand on that.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnother student says, \u201cThey don\u2019t have one because they don\u2019t actually lend money out. They just keep gold in vaults.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGood, Avery,\u201d Harry praises. Tom wants to lock up the word \u201cGood,\u201d from Harry\u2019s lips and keep it forever. \u201cOne could say that Gringotts isn\u2019t a bank so much as a storage facility. Keep going, class. Look at your notes if you must.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAh!\u201d A Gryffindor student yells out, one of the Blacks. \u201cIt keeps the wizarding world stagnant. There\u2019s no way for the money supply to increase so growth is almost impossible and it makes resources perpetually scarce.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTom feels his head start to spin.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank you for that wonderful reading of your notes, Sirius. Precisely. Which is why you all will change that. We\u2019re going to bring a true financial system to this country and we\u2019re going to do it together. We\u2019re going to create growth. But we only have eight months until you sit for your IB exams and we are already much too behind. Today we will be reviewing the impact of taxes on GDP and if you are very good, we may be able to begin on inflation next week. Tomorrow, we change the world.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThere is a collective cheer from the class. Harry begins to speak and write things on the board and Tom sits on the desk entirely convinced that Harry has managed to start a cult. As a squib no less! It is all rather concerning, but Harry makes so many compelling points Tom begins to think that Harry may be on to something.\n\u00a0\nFor no reason at all, Tom sits next to Harry at the high table for meals for the next few weeks. The division between those taking Muggle-Studies and those not continues to grow. And then, three months into the term, a Patronus in the shape of a Phoenix delivers a message to Harry, \u201cFawkes would like to see you,\u201d intones Dumbledore\u2019s voice.\n\u00a0\nHarry releases a deep sigh and says, \u201cExpecto Patronum,\u201d and a brilliant stag bursts forth from his wand. \n\u00a0\nNOT A SQUIB! Tom\u2019s mind immediately supplies. POWERFUL WIZARD WHO IS HOT AND SMART, it also supplies. \n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, yeah, I\u2019ll be there,\u201d Harry says in a put-upon tone.\n\u00a0\nTom Riddle has never once desired legitimate companionship, but as he watches the stag gallop away, he thinks, \u201cThis could really be the beginning of something.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis stunning depiction of Harry in his combat-booted glory was drawn by AO3's very own Mind_Chronicles. If you have any art you would like to submit, send it to [email\u00a0protected]. Back to the story.\n\nAt Malfoy manor, three fireplaces crackle merrily in the formal living room. Tom drops a book onto the great oak table at the center of the space with a satisfying thwack.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAbraxas hesitantly picks up the book, silk sleeves of his robes brushing the cover before grasping it between elegant fingers.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cEconomics for the IB Diploma,\u201d he reads out to the silent group of assembled gentlemen. \u201cMy Lord, what is this book? I do not recognize the author or the subject matter.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nOn Tom\u2019s face, Abraxas sees a truly terrifying expression of superiority. \u201cThis book is the key to improving the wizarding world. Forget blood politics, economics is how we can invest in our futures.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAbraxas has concerns that his lord has succumbed to mania and the Malfoy lord has no interest in abandoning his philosophy of blood traitors and mudbloods. He has, however, earned a healthy fear of his lord\u2019s cruciatus and in order to avoid pain, he decided to humor his leader.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe flips to a random point in the book, manicured nails shining as the pages flash by. \u201cMarket failure occurs when the condition for the market is allocatively inefficient, resulting in either an under-allocation of resources or an over-allocation of resources.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nGoyle calls out, \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nSelf importantly, Tom responds, \u201cIt all goes back to the concept of scarcity.\u201d He has been attending Harry's evening economics classes religiously. This is all easy to him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAbraxas turns to another page, heart beating fast. \u201cStagnation occurs within economies where total output is either declining, flat, or growing at a very limited pace. Persistent unemployment is characteristic of this condition. Stagnation results in flat job growth, no wage increases, and an absence of stock market booms or highs.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nRowle asks, \u201cWhat are stocks?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nTom smiles mysteriously and says, \u201cYou\u2019ll need to read that book to find out.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAbraxas, being rather smart, guesses, \u201cWe\u2019re stagnating, aren\u2019t we?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nTom sits on an ottoman with a silver mink fur throw blanket draped over the top. \u201cOh yes, indeed we are. The wizarding world is trapped in time and our new cause is to bring a legitimate financial system to this country.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAbraxas eyes a topic about profit margins and sighs internally. He did like the goal of eradicating those lesser than him, but the promise of increased wealth and a growing world does appeal to him. As always, he thanks his instincts for promising fealty to his lord.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIB Economics it is,\u201d he agrees.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nTom\u2019s satisfaction is almost a tangible thing.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n***\n\n\u00a0\n\nTom is sitting next to Harry at the high table absent-mindedly eating as he meticulously absorbs information in his new biology textbook. He wonders if Harry will say anything about his new subject of study. He looks forward to discussing photosynthesis with Harry and considering how it affects a variety of magical plants.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen Tom turns to observe Harry out of the corners of his eyes, he notices that Harry looks rather pale and uncomfortable. He keeps tugging at the collar of his cable-knit sweater and swearing under his breath. He pushes eggs around his plate and has not eaten even one bite.\n\n\u00a0\n\nConcerned, Tom closes his book and gives Harry his full attention.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry startles and his emerald gaze snaps to Tom. His eyes are \n\nso green. \n\nLike a lush forest where Tom could lose himself.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry self-consciously scratches the back of his neck. \u201cThat obvious, huh?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nTom retrieves a treacle tart and slides it onto Harry\u2019s plate. He cuts the tart into a bite-sized piece and raises it to Harry\u2019s lips.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat is not an answer,\u201d he notes.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry goes cross-eyed looking at the tart. \u201cWhat are \u2013 what are you doing?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nTom presses the tart piece insistently against Harry\u2019s full lips. \u201cIf you insist on deflecting my questions, I insist on you eating.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh for the love of \u2013\u201d Harry begins, and grabs the fork right out of Tom\u2019s hands to bite the tart himself. When he grabs the fork, his pinky and ring fingers brush over Tom\u2019s and Tom feels warmth spread over him. Obligingly he lets his hand drop from the utensil and watches as Harry swallows the first bite and then takes another. He closes his eyes and releases a small moan. \u201cOh, that is good.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nTom watches in rapt attention and feels intensely jealous of the fork as Harry closes his lips around it.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry continues eating, clearly thinking that Tom will drop his questioning.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTom will not.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOnce Harry has finished the tart, Tom asks again, \u201cWhy are you\u2026 nervous?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry sighs. \u201cYou\u2019re like, impossible to get off track. You know that, right? Obsessive.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d Tom says with a winning smile. \u201cI will never give this up so you may as well tell me now.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry sighs again and studies his plate. \u201cSo you know how my last name is \u2018Potter\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nTom says, \u201cIndeed, I do.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAnd, well, James Potter thinks I look an awful lot like him so he told his family about me, and now they want to meet me in case we\u2019re, well, related.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nTom absorbs that. He barely paid any attention to the Potter boy in Gryffindor. He's well enough at defense, rowdy, just another pureblood ponce. Dressed in distressed jeans and combat boots, Harry has hardly ever looked like a pureblood wizard. Furthermore, Tom is fairly sure that Harry was raised by muggles. The Potters are renowned for taking children seriously and Tom cannot believe Harry would have ever been abandoned by such a prominent wizarding family.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHogwash,\u201d Tom says, \u201cWeren\u2019t you raised by muggles?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI was,\u201d Harry confirms. Tom\u2019s natural skill as a legimillens allows him to know this is the truth. \u201cBut, well, I have wondered if\u2026\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIf?\u201d Tom prompts.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe resemblance and our shared last names would cause\u2026questions.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nTom asks, \u201cWould you want to be a Potter?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry tugs at a stand of his hair. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he whispers, \u201cI\u2019m not sure wanting has anything to do with it. It\u2019s just something I am.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nTom catches on to that phrase. \u201cYou think you\u2019re a Potter? From the wizarding world?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry\u2019s breath catches. \u201cI \u2013 I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nTom's eyes narrow.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThat was a \n\nlie.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n***\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe Potter family requests Harry meets them in their home, so Harry takes the floo from his office. He yells out, \u201cPotter Manor,\u201d and then is whisked away.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe stumbles out of the fireplace, soot-covered, into a stately home with high ceilings and cream-colored rugs. He needs to take a moment to catch himself and dust his knees before straightening.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Potters, Harry\u2019s grandparents, and great-uncles, and even James, his father that he\u2019s been getting to know, are all assembled in proper Wizarding robes in front of him.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry regrets his choice of outfit very dearly and wishes he\u2019d sucked it up and put on some robes.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d a woman says in a no-nonsense sort of voice, \u201cHe certainly has the looks and floo clumsiness of a Potter.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nA man who looks like an older version of both Harry and James coughs slightly to hide a laugh. \u201cQuite right, Euphemia, quite right.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cProfessor,\u201d James says with a blinding grin, \u201cCome on, I\u2019ll show you to the table. Mum and Aunt Dorea prepared a bunch of tea accompaniments.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry is led to a large dining room that has one glass wall facing a garden. The garden is filled with flowers in full bloom, autumn trees with orange, pink, and golden leaves, and a red bridge over a large pond reflecting all the colors like a mirror. A single swan swims leisurely and creates ripples in the crystal water.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry takes a seat next to James and startles as a few scones march to his plate and begin buttering themselves.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe never has used magic like this. He watches in rapt attention as the cups fill on their own with tea and use morse code to ask him how much sugar and cream he would like. He feels a lump in his throat as he wonders if he\u2019d have been taught these household charms growing up if his parents or grandparents had lived to be there in his childhood.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nOnce Harry has taken his first sip of tea, everyone goes about introducing themselves. Charlus and Dorea Potter look very wealthy indeed and their son, Henry, looks a bit smug but not terribly unpleasant. Harry notes that they are his great-aunt, great-uncle, and a sort of cousin but one generation removed. It\u2019s odd to think of it like that when Harry in this universe is much older than James and only a bit younger than Henry. Fleamont and Euphemia introduce themselves next and Harry cannot stop looking in absolute wonder at the both of them, memorizing the faces of his grandparents.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nJames introduces himself with a flourish and says, \u201cBut you knew me already.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry chuckles obligingly and says, \u201cI do. A great student even if you seem allergic to homework.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey! I just skive off geography and maths. I\u2019m \n\ngreat \n\nat econ and literature.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry almost retorts but Dorea raises her hand and Harry pauses.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAs pleasant as this is, and it \n\nis \n\npleasant, we did invite you here for a reason, Mr. Harry \n\nPotter.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nEveryone suddenly seems focused.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI heard you were raised by muggles,\u201d Euphemia mentions.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI was,\u201d Harry says. \u201cUntil I was 17.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAnd then you lived on your own?\u201d She asks.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry thinks of the days of living with Ginny and the two of them breaking up, and getting back together, and then spending one idyllic summer with each other and realizing after unsatisfying sex they felt like siblings and loved each other just not like\u2026 that.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey kept living together, and Harry dated some guys and Ginny dated some girls, and Ron and Hermione applauded them both.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI lived with my best friends until I got this job.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI see,\u201d Dorea comments. \u201cWere they wizards?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThey were. Best ones I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHm,\u201d Charlus says.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe certainly seems like a Potter,\u201d Fleamont says.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019d certainly never abandon one of ours,\u201d Henry says. \u201cSo if he is a Potter, how did he end up in the muggle world?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cEnough chitter-chatter, we can ask those questions after we confirm whether or not he is one of us.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nJames leans over and whispers, \u201cSorry about them talking to you like you\u2019re not there.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll do a simple direct descendant spell first,\u201d Dorea decides. \u201cThe light will be blue and it will turn gold if you are the direct descendant of the caster. If you are not the direct descendant of any of the Potters here, we can get more creative and test out familial relations. Is this something you consent to?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHarry feels out of his body. He supposes such a spell would glow for Fleamont and Euphemia unless his being in this alternate universe marks him as not being their grandchild. He has no idea what will happen and he doesn\u2019t know if getting to be with all the family he saw in the mirror back when he was eleven and lonely is a good or bad idea.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe certainly wants them. He has always wanted this family.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMaybe that\u2019s why he nods even though he thinks it is a bad idea.\n\n\u00a0\n\nCharlus casts the spell first and the light remains blue.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDorea purses her lips. \u201cFleamont?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nFleamont casts the spell and as soon as the words pass his lips, Harry is enveloped in a golden light.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nEuphemia gasps and as soon as the spell ends immediately casts it herself. Harry is again lit up in a golden halo.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFleamont says, dryly, \u201cDid you think I was unfaithful?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nEuphemia seems incredibly overcome with emotion and she manages a watery, \u201cLove potions and memory charms do exist, dearest.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe and Fleamont stare at Harry with wide eyes and Dorea shakes herself. Charlus says, \u201cHow is this possible?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nEuphemia apparates directly to Harry\u2019s side without bothering to stand up from her chair and immediately throws her arms around him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOh my son, I do not how I forgot you, but I am so sorry.\u201d She begins weeping softly into his shoulder.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nJames\u2019 eyes bug out of his head.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nFleamont comes over more slowly, and rests his hand on Harry\u2019s head. \u201cI am sorry to have failed you, but we will make it up to you. Oh, my son.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry feels he ought to correct them but he has no idea how to explain that he is actually their grandchild when he is older than James.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry is brought into a cozy family room where his grandparents and father crowd around, Euphemia clutching at his arm and mentioning that her grandfather had green eyes.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nDorea looks serious. \u201cWe have to assume then that there was foul play. Someone took the child from the Potters and placed him with muggles. For what reason, I cannot surmise.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nFleamont says, gruffly, \u201cDo you know who took you?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry says, \u201cI don\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nEuphemia makes a wounded noise. \u201cYou have nothing to be sorry for, do you hear me? Nothing. Oh, to think if James hadn\u2019t said anything I might never have found you\u2026\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDorea and Euphemia both look murderous and Fleamont and James seem overjoyed to have Harry join their family.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u201cA long-lost big brother!\u201d James crows. \u201cOh, Sirius will LOVE this. You\u2019ll have to stay with us in the summer, of course. Sirius was so butthurt he couldn\u2019t leave campus today because he\u2019s practically one of us now but good old Dumbles didn't let him get the day, but you\u2019ll see plenty of him for holidays.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry coughs. \u201cWell, I do have my own place and I\u2019m already forty\u2026\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI am 69\u00a0 and I think you must stay with us,\u201d Fleamont says. \u201cKeep your place but stay with us anyway.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nEuphemia says, \u201cI\u2019m a bit older than that, and I know we are strangers, but I am your mother and it would so much to me if I got the chance to know you better.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI suppose I can spend some of the summer\u2026\u201d Harry is cut off when Euphemia throws her arms around him and Fleamont starts crying.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry is carted off to Gringott\u2019s where the goblins confirm Harry is indeed the direct descendant of both Euphemia and Fleamont. They eye him a bit warily.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nEuphemia and Fleamont name Harry heir in addition to James, tell him they\u2019re so proud of him, that they\u2019ll write him every week, that they \n\nlove him so much, \n\nand then James and Harry return to Hogwarts in the late evening.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry is about to make it up to his rooms when Tom comes out of nowhere and grabs his wrist.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry looks into Tom\u2019s eyes and sees they are burning with intensity.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAnd? Are you a Potter?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry\u2019s mind is a bit in disarray. He will spend the summer with his godfather, father, and grandparents. They all love him. Just one day after meeting him and they love him. All this family he never had a chance to meet took one look at him stumbling out of a fireplace and called him their own. He\u2019s never had family like this before. The Weasleys loved him but he was never one of them all the way down, he never had the red hair or the freckles.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut these Potters, they have his black hair and face shape and they\u2019re like him and they love him.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he says faintly. \u201cJames is calling me his brother.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHis \n\nbrother? \n\nHow on earth did you end up in the muggle world?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThey think I was kidnapped or something. And then their memories were wiped.\u201d Even though Harry knows this is all a lie, it does seem to be a better story than, \u2018oh yeah, Tom.\u00a0 I\u2019m actually from the future in another universe and I came over here to keep you from murdering everyone I love.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\n\nTom does something entirely unexpected and pulls Harry into a hug. He\u2019s strong and smells like pine, nettle, and something expensive. All of Harry\u2019s senses go haywire and he tries to push against Tom but somehow only burrows closer.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat must have been hard. To have realized you had family all this time but didn\u2019t even know you were alive.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry\u2019s mind thinks, a bit hysterically, \n\nis tom showing actual empathy right now?\u00a0\n\nHe also thinks,\u00a0it is hard. It's hard to see the different life I could have had if they survived.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c...Yeah.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nTom pulls back and gives Harry a once-over. \u201cPsychology textbooks are so helpful.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry realizes that Tom must have been testing out something he got from the psychology book but he cannot help but feel like Tom reading anything from muggles is a huge win.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s biology going?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nTriumphantly, Tom says, \u201cI learned about meiosis.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry nods. \u201cCell division is one of my favorites.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nTom walks Harry to his rooms, and they talk about anaphase the whole way there.\n\n\u00a0\n\n***\n\n\u00a0\n\nTom comes to Harry\u2019s next seventh-year economics class and notices how James saunters in and calls out, \u201cHeya, Professor Brother.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry smiles and responds, \u201cLittle Potter, please take a seat.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nSirius Black falls onto his desk laughing hysterically. \u201cOh dear lord, Prongs, I will from now on only ever refer to you as \u2018Little Potter.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nJames looks playfully betrayed and Harry grins wickedly. \u201cEveryone, welcome welcome. Today we are going to talk about exchange rates.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nOver the next two hours, Harry deftly outlines the basics of how governments invest in foreign currencies and how expectations of values impact exchange rates.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd then, in the last twenty minutes of class, Harry destroys Tom\u2019s world again.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Harry says offhandedly, \u201cJust like the CFA franc is fixed at 655.957 per French Franc, and trust me, in our next class we WILL be going over modern-day colonialism hidden by economics but I digress \u2013 just like the fixed rate of conversion of the CFA franc, there is a fixed rate of conversion for galleons and pounds. There\u2019s no true exchange rate nor money market in the wizarding world. This means that one galleon will always be worth how many pounds?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAbout five!\u201d The class choruses.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cExactly. And since there is inflation in the muggle world but not in the wizarding world, you essentially make 2 - 4% more money annually by keeping your money in the muggle world and then converting it into wizarding money whenever you want to make a purchase. That relates back to the concept of real GDP we\u2019ve already covered.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDoes that mean we should get muggle jobs?\u201d Dinkle asks.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry spreads his hands. \u201cWhy do you think I\u2019m preparing you for the IB exams?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nLily Evans gasps. \u201cWe can use our scores to get into muggle universities!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry gives a fond smile. \u201cDing ding ding! We have a winner. Many muggle jobs, especially the ones in finance, are far more lucrative than anything in the wizarding world anyway. The muggles do, after all, have growing economies and far more opportunities than the wizards.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe class nods and Tom realizes that Harry is not merely smart, he is brilliant and he is \n\nplanning. \n\nHe is shaping the world in a tangible way and Tom wants to be by his side as he changes everything.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd Tom will get what he wants, one way or another.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201c....\n\nNext class we will cover modern-day colonialism from France especially and briefly cover the stock market. Next week we will cover both topics in more depth. Now go off, shoo, get some rest before you make history.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe always does.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTom can tell that he and Harry are becoming\u2026something. There\u2019s a tension to all of their interactions, a sort of gravity that gives every look, every smile, every touch substantial weight.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTom begins feeding Harry bits of treacle tart and other sweets after the night-economic classes and while Harry initially looks at him weirdly for it, he slowly begins to unhesitatingly close his plush lips around Tom\u2019s fork, Tom\u2019s spoon, and Tom\u2019s fingers.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd Tom keeps coming to every muggle studies class he can attend, sitting behind Harry\u2019s desk in the comfortable armchair as Harry traipses around the room and lectures the class.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTom and Harry debate Hobbes and Locke together by the fireplace in Tom\u2019s personal rooms and spend the whole night laughing over a bottle of wine.\n\u00a0\nBy the end of the night, Harry is giggling and breathless and Tom has to carry him to Tom's own bed, too wasted himself to deposit Harry back in his room like a proper gentleman.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen Harry is plopped on the bed, shoes half off his feet, sweater knocked off one shoulder baring creamy skin and sharp collarbones, he looks up at Tom with sparkling mirth-filled eyes.\n\u00a0\nUnable to help himself, Tom leans down and presses a chaste kiss to the corner of Harry\u2019s mouth.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d Harry slurs, beginning to press his face into the pillow and fiddling to get his glasses off.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cHmm?\u201d Tom says.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou kissed me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid I?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMmmm.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHmmm.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHarry whispers, \u201cI never thought it could be fun like this.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat could be?\u201d Tom asks, sliding into bed.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cGetting to know you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHarry begins snoring and Tom is left with the uncomfortable feeling that those words Harry just spoke were big and meant something big. Harry\u2019s snores are strangely melodic and very quiet, more like the purring of a cat than anything else.\n\u00a0\nTom feels an odd sort of hammering in his chest and breathes deeply, enjoying the smell of expensive elven wine and the pine notes and lightning he\u2019s come to associate with Harry Potter.\n\u00a0\nIn the morning, he wakes up alone.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n***\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHarry writes the word \u201cScarcity\u201d in big, friendly, bubble letters on the blackboard at the front of the room.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cCongratulations on sitting your IB exams. I realize you are all anxiously waiting to begin your NEWT testing, and we will have a party next class right before summer hols,\u201d there is a collective cheer, \u201cbut today I wanted to cover what exactly scarcity means to the wizarding world.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTom watches with amusement as James leaps out of his seat and yells, \u201cI WAS WONDERING! Because, like, we can just magic ourselves most things.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMost is one operative word, but things is actually more indicative of scarcity in magical society. There are of course things we cannot magic for ourselves: we do not actually make something from nothing, and a transfigured food item is not actually nourishing. Still, with magic, we do not have to concern ourselves with famine as we can merely use magic to grow plenty and preserve the harvest better than muggles can. We are excellent at making things. Goods, if you will. But tell me, Miss Evans, what are most post-industrial OECD country economies based upon?\u201d\n\u00a0\nLily Evans, eyes the same color as Harry\u2019s, releases a little gasp. \u201cGoods AND services.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHarry looks incredibly proud and Tom shifts in his seat as he imagines that same gaze trained toward him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cRight. Goods and services. The services in our economy are severely lacking. We don\u2019t have plethoras of financial advising, pet care services, child care services, and companies as simple as spas. Our world is made up of shops selling either items or restaurants supplying food \u2014 not services. And this, I propose, is because no one can ever get the funds to create an innovative new company. Everything is passed down and no one ever borrows money to create these new businesses. Think about it: Ollivander\u2019s is more than a thousand years old, Borgin and Burkes is over a century old. There are so few new businesses and even within our new shops, there has been nothing disruptive to our economy and little to no service-based industry. Services are scarce. The few services offered \u2014 like medical care \u2014 are in high demand. There is a huge gap between demand and supply in this market which is why you, my beautiful children, should go out and learn from muggles and then come back and fix this world!\u201d\n\u00a0\nThere\u2019s a deafening cheer and Harry sits on his desk, the picture of a relaxed gentleman.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cCongratulations on the semester,\" Harry says when the din dies out, \"Party next class!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll bring the firewhisky,\u201d Sirius Black crows.\n\u00a0\nHarry says, \u201cI\u2019ll confiscate it.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBlack winks. \u201cOnly if you can find it.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAs the kids filter out of the room laughing and talking to each other, they all take a moment to say thank you to Harry in some way.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA few moments later and Harry and Tom are alone in the classroom.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI started a muggle studies book club,\u201d Tom announces. Tom has sat down in the desk chair and Harry turns around on the desk so that his legs are dangling to the side of Tom\u2019s lap.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d Harry asks evenly. He licks the corner of his mouth as if there was something on his lip. It\u2019s the exact place Tom kissed last night.\n\u00a0\nTom follows the movement with narrowed eyes. He knows what seduction looks like and this is a poor attempt at subtlety. It\u2019s not as if he\u2019s averse to getting to know Harry on an\u2026 intimate level.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe carefully grasps Harry\u2019s ankles with gentle hands and positions either appendage on the armrests of the chair. Harry is now sitting with spread legs and his crotch almost precisely at Tom\u2019s eye level. Tom gently rubs circles into Harry\u2019s ankles. He looks up and catches Harry\u2019s face which looks unchanged save for the hint of blush on his nose.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nGot you.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d Tom says, letting his voice deepen to a dark rumble. \u201cWe\u2019re self-studying economics and planning to make the wizarding\u2019s world first bank.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIs that all?\u201d Harry asks, slowly kicking off his boots and then drawing a sock-covered foot over Tom\u2019s half-hard, cloth-covered cock. Tom can feel himself twitching. He hooks his hand around Harry\u2019s waist and draws the man onto his lap, forcing Harry to straddle him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTom nips at the shell of Harry\u2019s ear. \u201cJust planning on the bank. The first real one in this world.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHarry shudders and throws his head back, exposing a column of his unmarked throat for Tom to trace teeth over and leave bruising kiss marks. \u201cAny wars in your future?\u201d\n\u00a0\nTom smiles against Harry\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple. \u201cJust wealth, darling. And power. Would you care to join me? We could use your expertise.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTom is fully hard now and he can feel that Harry is also. He shifts the man in his lap so that their erections touch and Harry begins to rock languidly against Tom. A bead of sweat rolls down his forehead and Tom surges up to lick it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI would love to make a bank with you,\u201d Harry says, and then he forcefully grinds down on Tom\u2019s erection and crashes their lips together.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe kiss starts off feverish, and Tom feels like Harry being here in his arms is what he\u2019s been missing for ages \u2014 like a piece of his heart was cleaved straight from his chest and Harry is the missing organ.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe grips the soft fabric of Harry\u2019s sweater in one hand and his thick hair in the other to bring Harry's body to his chest and jerk the man's head to one side so he can mouth down the line of Harry\u2019s throat.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHarry allows it for a moment, gasping and writhing, before cupping Tom\u2019s face with two cool hands to tilt his head up, cradling him with care and affection that makes Tom feel weak, and kissing him with perfect control. Tom licks into Harry\u2019s mouth and Harry gasps, so Tom presses deeper, caressing one of Harry\u2019s hands with his own pressed against his face before taking the hand and folding it behind Harry\u2019s back.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTom takes control of the kiss once more, making it slow and sensual. It is an introduction and there is such victory with every breathy moan Harry releases.\n\u00a0\nTom reaches his free hand down to cup both his and Harry\u2019s erection and the pleasure is white hot \u2014 he is coming before he knows what\u2019s happened, tingles spreading down his spine and warmth spreading in his trousers.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHarry breaks off the kiss and presses his sweat-dampened forehead to Tom\u2019s, breathing heavily.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTom feels like he is fifteen and clumsy when he asks, but he has never been a selfish lover (even if he is selfish in nearly every other respect,) and so he says, haltingly, \u201cDid you come?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHarry laughs and Tom feels the ghost of his joy fanning across his cheeks. \u201cYeah. Twice.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTwice?\u201d Tom pulls back. \u201cHow\u2019d you manage that?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHarry giggles. \u201cMagic.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTom sucks another bruise into Harry\u2019s neck for the comment and basks in the knowledge that his skills were great enough to bring Harry to orgasm. Twice.\n\u00a0\n\u201cEch let\u2019s get cleaned up though,\u201d Harry says, casually wandlessly and wordlessly casting cleaning spells on them both and then standing up and stretching his arms to the sky. \u201cAh bad teacher moment. Now I\u2019m going to associate this classroom with clothed sex. Gotta like, think of my elementary spelling teacher or something to get rid of the association.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTom sidles up behind Harry and presses a nose to his hair. \u201cOr don\u2019t,\u201d he suggests, breathing in Harry\u2019s scent. He marvels in this man's power and intelligence. \u201cJust let yourself be consumed with thoughts of me.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTom can hear the smile in Harry\u2019s voice when the man replies, \u201cThere\u2019s the Tom I know. Can\u2019t though. You\u2019re gonna need me to be good at thinking of a lot of things if you want to open a bank.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd I do, darling. I very much do.\u201d\n\u00a0\n***\n\u00a0\nOver the weekend, Tom introduces Harry to his knights. Harry, in turn, is a delightful chaotic demon who makes fun of all of them endlessly by comparing them to muggle characters from literature and giving them no context.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAfter Goyle makes a comment about the expressionism of banks (perhaps he meant to say exceptionalism?) Harry delights in saying, around a mouthful of expensive mermaid-trout caviar, \u201cYou remind of Mrs. Malaprop!\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWho?\u201d Goyle asks.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cOne of the best people ever known to Brinsley Sheridan. It\u2019s a compliment, don\u2019t worry.\u201d\n\u00a0\nGoyle clearly does worry, but mostly because he thinks he ought to know who Sheridan is. Tom is unfamiliar with the name, but he can tell that what Harry said was a barbed insult.\u00a0\nThroughout the night, Malfoy is compared to Robert Shallow and Nott to the Wizard of Oz. \u201cHe was a great wizard,\u201d Harry assures, \u201cReally knew how to work a crowd.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTom is familiar with the works of L. Frank Baum and asks Harry after the day is done why he compared Nott to a muggle.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNott's all about showmanship, isn\u2019t he? But there\u2019s not a lot of substance. I was a bit let down.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWhile at the event, however, no one can deny Harry\u2019s brilliance. Over the course of an afternoon and evening, the group begins drafting the plan and funds to open the first ever wizarding bank.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cOnce we\u2019ve got everything all tied up and ready to go, I\u2019ll be sure to include the Potters.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe Potters?\u201d Abraxas says, aghast. \u201cBut they\u2019re blood traitors!\u201d\n\u00a0\nTom expects Harry to get red in the face and angry and storm out but Harry reminds placid. \u201cIf you hope to make a bank for purebloods in your camp only, I\u2019m sorry to say you won\u2019t get anywhere.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHarry then painstakingly explains how banks work again, and who would need to borrow money again, and mentions that the Potters are his family, and then discusses bringing some wealthy muggleborns onto the board and by that point, Abraxas is so thoroughly confused that he simply agrees and begs his house elves to bring him the strongest liquor money can buy.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAt that point, Tom and Harry take their leave and Tom kisses Harry breathless when they stumble back into his rooms at Hogwarts. \u201cYou were stunning tonight,\u201d he says.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHarry kisses Tom on his left cheek then his right and says, \u201cI cannot believe the kind of man you are in this world, but I adore it all the same.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe odd wording feels important but that's a puzzle for future Tom. Current Tom is feeling upset at how much clothing Harry is wearing.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLet me take you,\u201d Tom says between kisses. His hands find their ways to Harry\u2019s arse and he kneads the flesh there, desperate to get as close as possible and feel again like his heart is whole. \u201cLet me.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHarry pushes back and pecks Tom on his nose. \u201cI will, darling. But you\u2019ll have to earn it first.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd with that, Harry begins to exit Tom\u2019s room. Tom calls out, frustrated but understanding that Harry seems to need space, \u201cHow? How?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHarry calls back, amused, \u201cTake me on a date!\u201d\n\u00a0\nA date. Tom can do that. A date.\u00a0 He'll bring Harry on the best date known to man. Tomorrow. And then he will have sex with Harry. And then they will open a bank. In that order.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTom is very smart.\u00a0\nHarry knows that Tom has opted to go beyond simplicity and into ridiculous extravagance when an invitation for a romantic evening is delivered by three white swans into Potter manor. The invitation itself is a gold embroidered envelope floating above a crystal sculpture of a hundred roses with a hundred miniature hummingbirds fluttering their shimmering wings and dipping their fine beaks into the red petals to hunt for nectar. This sculpture is delicately placed down by the three swans in front of Harry\u2019s breakfast oatmeal before they make their stunning exits, golden ribbons shimmering on their necks. The sounds of the hundred hummingbirds as they search for crystalline nectar is a rhythmic and pleasant tinkling sound.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBemused, Harry plucks the floating invitation out of the air as James stares in shock and Euphemia drops her spoon.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell,\u201d she says after a moment, \u201cThat is quite something.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJames sputters, \u201cBlimey, who\u2019s that from then?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHarry unfolds the note, taking an appreciative whiff of the soft rose scent it emits. It smells to Harry like spring melting into the unmistakable hues of luxury. \u201cIf my hunch is correct, I would wager your second favorite professor.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJames startles, \u201cFROM PROFESSOR RIDDLE? FROM THAT MAN??\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd  what could Professor Riddle want with you?\u201d Fleamont Potter asks with narrowed eyes.\n\u00a0\nHarry skims the note. \u201cDinner it would seem,\u201d he answers gravely.\n\u00a0\nFleamont swallows a sip of tea. \u201cAh,\u201d he remarks.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cARE YOU GONNA GO?\u201d James bellows.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCalm yourself,\u201d Euphemia responds.\n\u00a0\nHarry nods at James and quickly pulls out scrap paper and pens a fast response. In chicken scratch he writes, \u201cSure,\u201d and efficiently calls one of the family owls over. The owl flies away.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHarry goes back to eating his oatmeal and ignores the sculpture in front of him Very Hard. James does not ignore it and neither do Harry\u2019s grandparents.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe more Harry tries to ignore the sculpture, the more it seems to try to catch his attention, sparkling aggressively and each hummingbird flapping its wings just a tad harder. The message is clear: Harry can ignore the sculpture but it will not ignore him back.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNeedy little fucker, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Harry mutters, finally giving the damn thing a good look.\n\u00a0\nEuphemia calls out a scandalized, \u201cLanguage, dear!\u201d even as her son and husband laugh into their hands.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe sculpture preens.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n***\n\n\n\nWhen Tom picks up Harry in a golden chariot drawn by six diamond-adorned Abraxans, he merely rolls his eyes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSliding into the seat next to Tom in the ostentatious thing, he says, \u201cBit much, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\u00a0\nTom is dressed in a navy blue velvet suit with a royal purple cloak fastened with interwoven sapphires. Harry takes a moment to feel slightly underdressed in his cable-knit forest green sweater and grey jeans before deciding he can\u2019t be bothered to care.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTom gives Harry an amused half-smile. \u201cI do not. \u2018A bit much\u2019 could never be used to apply the amount of effort a first date warrants.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHarry shakes his head as the carriage ascends over Godrick\u2019s Hollow and the trees turn to silhouettes against the backdrop of a red-fire sunset sky. \u201cBeen on many first dates?\u201d\n\u00a0\nTom hooks an arm around Harry, \u201cJealous?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHarry sniffs.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTom leans his head back and laughs. Harry looks on in genuine surprise as mirth feels Tom\u2019s eyes. It\u2019s a content and sparkling thing, but a bit mean around the edges. When Tom\u2019s chuckles subside he leans his head forward until his lips brush the shell of Harry\u2019s ears. \u201cDarling, you of all people should know I rarely need to  date.\u201d \n\u00a0\nHarry shivers and fails to be as unaffected as he would like.\n\u00a0\nDinner is in an opulent magical restaurant built in the midst of several charmed tree-houses. Flowers and a rolling brook can be seen from the beautiful wooden rooms clients are seated in. Each tree house is reserved for just one party, and Harry and Tom are seated alone with two goblets in front of them.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThere isn't a menu?\u201d Harry asks if only to hide how impressed he is with everything.\n\nTom shakes his head. \u201cThat would defeat the magic. Incredible charms have been placed here so that you can always be brought exactly the meal you don\u2019t know you want, but will love nevertheless.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHarry nods as if that makes sense. \u201cHow many times have you been here?\u201d\n\u00a0\nTom responds, \u201cI? Just once. It takes years to get a reservation, after all.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHarry startles. \u201cThen how\u2019d you manage tonight on such short notice?\u201d\n\u00a0\nTom smiles mysteriously. \u201cSomeone owed me quite a large favor and was more than happy to let this settle their debt.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHarry thinks back to Voldemort and finds this statement quite easy to believe.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe first course is served soon after, Harry receives some sort of sesame brittle with goat cheese, fresh raspberries, and meat that tastes like lamb but better. He would never have ordered something like it, but he has to admit it's one of the best things he\u2019s ever eaten.\n\u00a0\nTom receives four brown macaroons. He takes a bite and closes his eyes in pleasure. \u201cI never would have expected a truffle macaroon, but this is divine.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI did not expect my dish either, but I have to hand it to you, this is amazing,\u201d Harry says.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTom seems smugly pleased. He holds up half of the macaroon he was eating and says, \u201cWould you like a taste?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHarry nods, \u201cI would love one.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTom pops the cookie in his mouth and before Harry can express his confusion, the taller man is pulling Harry forward until his knees slap against the polished mahogany table. Harry\u2019s lips collide with Tom\u2019s and in his shock, his mouth pops open. Tom wastes no time invading Harry\u2019s mouth, pushing the macaroon onto Harry\u2019s tongue. The delicate flavor of the cookie contrasts the richness of the truffle butter and Tom\u2019s lips are so soft. Harry can\u2019t help a soft moan that has Tom releasing a pleasing answering rumble. Harry swallows the bite of cookie and then rests his forehead against Tom\u2019s collarbone, still awkwardly positioned over the table.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Tom says pressing a kiss to Harry\u2019s forehead, \u201cJust breathe easy for me.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHarry stays in that position a few moments longer, pressing open mouth kisses to Tom\u2019s neck before his lips get captured in another bruising kiss. Tom gently nips Harry\u2019s lower lip.\n\u00a0\nWhen they part, Harry shakily sits back down on his side of the table and slightly dazed says, \u201cIt was good.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe does not know if he\u2019s talking about the macaroon or the kiss. By Tom\u2019s answering Cheshire cat grin, it couldn\u2019t matter less.\n\u00a0\nThe main course and dessert are no less phenomenal than the starter, and Harry has to admit this is the best first date he has ever been on.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen they return to the carriage, Harry realizes he doesn\u2019t want the night to end. \u201cWanna duel?\u201d He asks.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cDuel?\u201d Tom parrots, a glimmer of excitement entering his eyes. \u201cI think I\u2019d win, darling.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHarry responds, \u201cOnly one way to find out, isn\u2019t there?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cCheeky thing aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ve been told I do have a nice bum.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTom rolls his eyes with a fond look and directs the chariot to land in a semi-abandoned thicket near Potter manor.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t hate me if you lose?\u201d Tom asks.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d Harry says. \u201cI\u2019d be impressed.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTom readies his wand as Harry does the same. They bow to each other. Harry feels himself breaking into a grin as they each fire their first spells. Harry's Expelliarmus is deflected with a shield and Tom\u2019s jellylegs jinx is easily countered.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cAn Expelliarmus?\u201d Tom asks. \u201cReally? You never struck me as a pacifist.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHarry responds with a frost hex that Tom neatly side-steps. \u201cOld habits die hard,\u201d he says in explanation.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe first few moments of the duel are fun and simple, with both of them getting a sense of their opponent and not wanting to hurt one another at all.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe tempo begins to pick up and Harry feels power settling deep inside him. He hasn\u2019t pushed himself like this in so long. It feels good .  Almost  orgasmic.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nHarry somersaults under a shot of blue, uncaring if his sweater tears a bit. As he is coming out of his roll, he fires a knee-shattering curse at Tom\u2019s legs. Tom jumps out of the way with a surprised shout.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo you wanna play like that, is it?\u201d Tom murmurs.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe hexes and curses gain a level of true danger as Tom and Harry dance around one another. Harry fires a ground-loosening curse at Tom\u2019s feet, but Tom easily casts the counter, sending a hail hex hurtling toward Harry.\n\u00a0\nRecognizing the pattern, Harry conjures an umbrella and winks at Tom as the hail begins to fall around him. He wandlessly sends Tom a fire ball, vaporizing the hail and then banishing the umbrella.\n\u00a0\nTom curls the fire around his wand and sends it back to Harry.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHarry motions down with his hands, and the fire dissipates. On and on they duel, until the moon is bright and Harry is sweating with exertion.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt ends with Harry casting a strength charm on his leg and vaulting over the thicket, landing on Tom\u2019s chest and forcing the man to the ground with a wand in his neck.\n\u00a0\nAt the same time, Tom manages to snake an arm around Harry\u2019s lower back and shove his own yew wand into Harry\u2019s chest.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBreathing heavily, Harry looks down at Tom and says, \u201cA draw, then.\u201d\n\n\nTom sits up while keeping Harry in his lap. \u201cYou are a marvel,\u201d he whispers as if it's been pulled out of him without his consent. He sounds like he can\u2019t help himself, and his hands roam under Harry\u2019s shirt pulling Harry closer, closer, closer.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHarry leans forward and kisses him. He can feel Tom\u2019s erection pressing against his. Its so warm even though the outside is cold and dark. That one point of connection where they roll against one another is everything. Harry feels like the constellations he sees when he gazes at the sky pale in comparison to the way this feels.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe knows that no matter what happens, this moment of them kissing at midnight on the forest floor will be something he remembers for the rest of his life.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMaybe Tom intended a soft bed with fancy sheets and rose petals for their first time together. Instead, they impatiently strip each other right there and use the moss on the ground as their mattress. Tom dips conjured oil-slick fingers into Harry and Harry wraps oil-slick fingers around Tom\u2019s shaft with a devilish smirk.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey both try to undo each other before Tom can enter Harry, and when he finally does, when there\u2019s the first slide of Tom\u2019s cock in Harry\u2019s tight hole, they both moan at the feeling of completeness.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTom whispers into Harry\u2019s ears, \u201cWho do you belong to?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHarry pushes Tom down and rides him while chasing his own pleasure. Green eyes reflecting the moon he answers. \u201cThe man who belongs to me. Is that you, Tom?\u201d\n\u00a0\nTom, never one to be outdone, effortlessly flips their positions and drives into Harry with the shorter man\u2019s back on the floor.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt will only ever be me. You are mine, Harry.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHarry wraps his ankles around Tom\u2019s back. \u201cYours,\u201d he repeats.\u00a0\n\n\n\n***\n\u00a0\nWhen they are lying next to each other under a hastily conjured blanket, Tom runs his hands over Harry\u2019s arms.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this one?\u201d He asks.\n\u00a0\nHarry says, \u201cThat one? Basilisk bite.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBASILISK BITE?\u201d Tom whisper-yells.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cTwelve-year-olds do the darndest things.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou were twelve and attacked by a  basilisk ? Where were the adults?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cCheering me on, probably.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTom breathes out angrily. \u201cThat is appalling.\u201d He holds Harry's hand out. \u201cAnd this one?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cA bad teacher.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou seem to be excellent at understating things.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou know, everything seems much less bad when you\u2019re no longer in it.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTom folds his hand over Harry\u2019s \u201cI must not tell lies scar.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cEven so,\u201d Tom responds, \u201cmemories of suffering can be suffering in their own way.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHarry leans his head against Tom\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI suppose that\u2019s true too.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMy scars exist almost entirely in my head. I don\u2019t like talking about it much but I was raised in an awful orphanage during the second world war. I still remember the feeling of gnawing hunger and the terrible knowledge that London burned outside and I was next.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHarry takes the offering as the gift it is and asks no more questions. Instead, he says, simply, \u201cI am glad you lived.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTom strokes his hand through Harry\u2019s locks. \u201cI cannot express how grateful I am that you are here today. The thought that you might have died before meeting me\u2026 it is devastating. If you ever leave me, I will burn the whole world down until I find you again.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHarry blinks. \u201cThat\u2019s rather intense for this early in our relationship.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTom props himself on one elbow and stares down at Harry. \u201cDoes it bother you?\u201d There\u2019s no hint of remorse or apology, only genuine curiosity.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Harry can see the monster still lurking beyond the facade of the man even in this Tom. He can see the growing seed of obsession and the danger that lies in every iteration of Tom Riddle. But more than anything, across two lifetimes he  knows this man.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHis answer is startlingly honest and comes out in parseltongue.  \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have you any other way.\u201d \n\u00a0\n***\n\u00a0\nNeedless to say, Harry\u2019s revelation of his understanding of the language of snakes only further feeds Tom\u2019s obsession and the man becomes a regular fixture in Harry\u2019s life and the life of all the Potters (and Sirius, who is part of the family by now after running away from home).\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe rest of the summer is a whirlwind of meetings, discussions, and Tom's increasingly smug face as he gets far too many people to sign on to something far too quickly. Wizards have never given much credence to logic, after all. Charisma seems to do the trick. Two weeks before the start of Hogwarts term, Harry, Tom, the Potter family, and a few other early investors (most of them death eaters) open the first-ever wizarding bank that allows lending and advertises interest rates.\nThey name it: \u201cFour House Bank.\u201d\nThe bank should not take off as quickly as it does.\n\u00a0\nTom quits his job with one week to go before the start of the 1979 Hogwarts term to become the bank manager. Harry is offered the Defense Against the Dark Arts post because Dumbledore does not realize the importance of muggle studies.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know you asked about it when you first came here, and I think you would be a great fit, my boy. The Defense post is the place where professors can truly help students protect themselves and prepare them for their futures!\u201d\n\u00a0\nHarry simply replies, \u201cI\u2019m happy where I am.\u201d\n\u00a0\nDumbledore sighs morosely. \u201cThough I wished you would say something else entirely, a yes, perhaps, I cannot begrudge your answer. For isn\u2019t happiness the greatest aspiration of all men?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHarry gives Dumbledore a wry smile. \u201cThere is someone I think would be a great fit for the role, even if he is a bit young and mean.\u201d\n\u00a0\nDumbledore tilts his head, blue eyes sparkling. \u201cWhy, I think you\u2019re right.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIt is with great joy that Harry shakes Severus Snape\u2019s hand at the Hogwarts Welcome Feast.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m so pleased to no longer be the youngest staff member,\u201d Harry gushes, piling absurd amounts of roast beef onto Snape\u2019s plate and delighting at the way the thin, young man\u2019s eyes bug out of his head.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cProfessor Potter, that\u2019s too much.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNonsense! You need to grow fat in order to be a teacher here. Also, it\u2019s Harry now. I am not your professor any longer even if I was last year.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSnape stares at Harry in an unamused manner. \u201cYou are the furthest thing from fat,  Harry. \u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not trying to get there, Sevvie. Life is all about the  trying.\u201d \n\u00a0\nSnape coughs. \u201cSevvie?\u201d He repeats, dumbfounded and obviously quite upset.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHarry throws his arm around the sallow man\u2019s shoulders and raises his goblet. \u201cOh, I can just tell we\u2019ll be great mates.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSeverus mumbles, \u201cDoubtful.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIt is a great night. And they do become friends.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn their own way, that is.\n\u00a0\n***\n\u00a0\nBut as was mentioned previously, the bank should not take off as quickly as it does. Word spreads that there is somewhere you can go to get money even if you have little money and that seems to be all the advertisement Four House Bank needs.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nLucius Malfoy and Tom adapt with shocking grace to being the managers of what rapidly becomes the most lucrative business in the wizarding world.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nIn the early days, Tom sits with prospective clients to explain what the bank does. He sits across from one such woman, Griselda Marchbanks, the two of them separated by a handsome desk.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHer wrinkles do not detract from the beauty she held in youth and instead bestow her with a kind of undefinable dignity. She wraps her red-manicured fingernails against the wooden desk.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling me that if I put money in this bank, it will grow?\u201d\n\u00a0\nTom nods, \u201cYes, you will accrue an annual interest rate of about two percent if you open an account with us and meet the minimum threshold.\u201d\n\u00a0\nShe squints at him. \u201cI have been grading too many exams to fall for this. Money cannot be created out of thin air.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTom grins at her and slides her the IB economics book across the table. \u201cYou\u2019ll find that it can. Please, review the chapters on money theory and supply.\u201d\n\u00a0\nShe squints at him some more. She nods, once. \u201cI appreciate someone who understands the value of learning. I will go and review this book and make my choice after.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTom leans back in his chair. \u201cCome back at your convenience. We look forward to your patronage.\u201d\n\u00a0\nGriselda Marchbanks levels him with an unimpressed stare. \u201cYou are awfully cocky, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u00a0\nTom winks. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to be arrogant when you\u2019re right.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMore to herself than to Tom, Marchbanks mutters, \u201cYou were cocky when you took your NEWTS too, and you aced every single one of them.\u201d More audibly she says, \u201cThank you for your time,\u201d before exiting the office.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n***\n\u00a0\nHarry gets permission to begin teaching muggle studies to first-year students. He writes a petition to the ministry to make muggle studies a mandatory course because it is important. He gets rejected, but that\u2019s alright. Life is all about the  trying.\u00a0 \n***\n\u00a0\nMost prospective clients are not nearly as discerning as Griselda Marchbanks. Tom enjoys a quick meeting with newly married Pandora Lovegood. She is a wisp of a thing, but her power is obvious as her desire for money.\n\u00a0\nShe begins the meeting by saying, \u201cPlease explain me to this concept of a \u2018loan.\u2019\n\u00a0\nTom replies, \u201cIn essence, Four House Banks will provide you with a sum of money with the expectation that over time, you will pay us back for that money plus some additional fees.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPandora says, \u201cIn Gringotts, the amount of money I can withdraw must be less than or equal to the amount I already have in my vault. But you\u2019re saying I don\u2019t need to have money to use money?\u201d\n\u00a0\nTom gives her his most comforting smile. \u201cTo be sure miss Lovegood, this money is not given out willy-nilly. The underwriting team will do a basic review of your assets and liabilities in order to determine the risk of your defaulting, but to answer your question, yes. We will give you money and you certainly do need to already possess the amount we will lend you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLovegood adopts a dreamy expression. \u201cAnd then I pay you back once I use that money you give me to make more money?\u201d\nTom adds, \u201cOr get more money from your profession, but essentially yes. That is truly the whole point of this system.\u00a0 And we do charge a slight fee for the privilege of getting a loan, but it is worth it for most people.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLovegood seems to bring herself down to earth. \u201cWhat happens if I can\u2019t pay?\u201d\n\u00a0\nMatter of factly, Tom responds, \u201cWe will seize all your monetary assets until the debt is settled. In your case, it would be quite everything, I'm afraid.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLovegood extends her hand to shake Tom\u2019s hand. With a manic gleam in her eye, she says, \u201cSounds like a good deal. I was worried you would take my magic or something. Count me in.\u201d\n\u00a0\n***\n\u00a0\nSix months after the bank is founded, Griselda Marchbanks opens an account. She brings with her several old and wealthy clients. Four House Banks is delivered a note from Gringotts asking them to close. They do not.\n\u00a0\n***\n\u00a0\nHarry writes another note asking to make muggle studies required curriculum. He is shot down again, but more politely.\n\u00a0\n***\n\u00a0\nThree years after the bank is opened, an impoverished man who has never had much to himself walks into the bank. His red hair is lanky and he just wants a better life for his five sons. He hates his low-paying job at the ministry where everyone stares down their noses at him and laughs at his tattered robes and his dreams of doing something with muggle technology.\n\u00a0\nWhen he comes in for his meeting, he shrinks from the fanciness and efficiency of Four House Banks\u2019 flagship office\u2019s interior. He is given a water bottle from an employee wearing a blazer that must cost more than four times Arthur\u2019s salary.\n\u00a0\n\u201cArthur Weasley?\u201d The employee asks with a tilted head scanning a crisp file. \u201cIt says here that you are of special interest.\u201d\n\u00a0\nArthur gulps. \u201cSpecial interest?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good thing, dear. Here, follow me.\u201d\n\u00a0\nArthur is led to a large lift that is far more friendly than the ones in the ministry and hums happily to him as it gently zooms around the building.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nArthur is let out onto what seems to be the executive office on the top floor. The whole floor makes up this one office and Arthur stares in shock at the large windows, an interior garden, and the sound of a gently bubbling stream.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cOver here,\u201d a rich voice calls, and Arthur follows the sound to a sofa where Harry Potter himself is sitting.\n\u00a0\nHarry Potter is the muggle studies professor at Hogwarts but he is somewhat of a legend too, being one of the two founders of this very bank.\n\u00a0\nArthur cannot understand why he would get to have a personal meeting with such a busy and important figure.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cCome, sit, sit,\u201d Harry says, eyes much too fond for looking at a stranger.\n\u00a0\nArthur sits, gingerly, embarrassed of his shabby clothes. \u201cWell then, hello. I am Arthur. Weasley! Arthur Weasley, that is.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHarry laughs in a way that somehow sounds expensive and comforting all at once. \u201cI am very much aware.\u201d\n\u00a0\nArthur flushes. \u201cRight. Right then.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHarry's bright green eyes are soft. \u201cSo the reason you are here today?\u201d\n\u00a0\nArthur fiddles with a loose thread. \u201cI want to borrow money. I mean I\u2019m sure everyone does. And I looked at your requirements for the loan of the size I want and I don\u2019t meet them, but I thought maybe I could make a case for why maybe we could work something out?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHarry nods once, encouragingly. \u201cYes, after reviewing your financial information, I admit you wouldn\u2019t normally qualify for much of anything here. That being said, I like you, Arthur. I want you to tell me what you would do with the money.\u201d\n\u00a0\nArthur takes a deep breath. \u201cMuggles make the most amazing products. They innovate all the time, from their pellyphones to their toast boxes. And I think I\u2019m close to learning how to make all the things muggles make that magic destroys magic proof or really, well, I\u2019ve been working on how to remake some muggle inventions but make them run on magic instead of elictrickacy and the people at the ministry, well, they think I\u2019m crazy and I\u2019m going to make cursed items but I think it will change the world, really I do, and the only one I\u2019ve figured out so far is this thing called a television but this could be somehting, it really could, and that\u2019s why I thought I would come to you. To make it happen.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHarry nods when Arthur finishes his speech. Arthur fiddles some more. He\u2019s been impolite. Belatedly he adds, \u201cSir. That\u2019s why I came to you  Sir.\u201d \u00a0\n\u00a0\nHarry lays a hand on Arthur\u2019s shoulder. It\u2019s thin and awfully delicate for this giant of a man who is changing the world. \u201cMr. Weasley,\u201d he says and there\u2019s something in his eyes that is emotional and looks almost like grieving love, \u201cI believe in you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Arthur asks, mouth falling open.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI believe in you,\u201d Harry repeats with a warm voice. Arthur\u2019s not sure he\u2019s ever heard that before. Certainly not from anyone that mattered, except maybe his wife.\n\u00a0\nHarry ends up giving him the money for free. All he asks is that Arthur open an account when the business takes off.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI will sir, I cannot thank you enough,\u201d he says, vigorously shaking Harry\u2019s hand in complete shock.\n\u00a0\nWhen Arthur calls the lift, he almost thinks he hears, \u201cNo. It\u2019s me who can never thank you enough.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHarry is kind enough to put Arthur in touch with a muggle-born consultant, a man named Ted Tonks, and the two of them work together to make the first magic-powered television. They release their first magical television (called MTV for short) in early 1980, a day after Ron is born. The MTVs are purchased only by niche consumers, and the Weasleys live as a very solidly middle-class family.\nA few months after, Harry Potter and Tom Riddle gush about how much they love watching movies when they\u2019re cuddled up together in the winter during an interview with the Daily Prophet.\n\u00a0\nAfter that, the business explodes and Ted and Arthur struggle to learn how to scale their business amidst insanely increased demand.\n\u00a0\nOne of Arthur\u2019s friends slides him a book titled,  Economics for the IB Diploma.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u201cMy daughter made me read that,\u201d Davey Gudgeon says. \u201cThere\u2019s a chapter on economies of scale. That\u2019s a good place to start.\u201d\n\u00a0\nArthur reads the whole book cover to cover. Then he buys several more muggle books teaching him how to scale and run a business.\n\u00a0\n(As magical televisions catch on, seeds are planted that will one day grow into a wizarding Hollywood. But that\u2019s decades away.)\n\u00a0\nBy the time Ginny Weasley is born in 1982, the Weasley family is on its way to becoming blessedly happy and very comfortable. It's still quite intense then, as they are doing their absolute best to meet demand and not quite getting there. They will, but that's a few years away. Harry comes to visit Molly and Arthur after the birth as he has somehow become a family friend and often attends Sunday brunches.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nArthur will never forget having someone believe in him. Harry, for his part, seems to somehow share the sentiment even though he has no reason to.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nArthur wrings his hands on this beautiful Sunday while Molly is holding their newborn. \u201cHarry,\u201d he begins, \u201cWould you like to, well, would you like to be Ron\u2019s godfather?\u201d The toddler glances at Harry shyly from behind his father's legs.\n\u00a0\nHarry blinks once, absolutely stunned. His eyes then fill up with what looks shockingly like tears. \u201cI would be \u2013 honored.\u201d He swallows once before his face breaks out into the most brilliant smile Arthur has ever seen. He leans down so he and Ron are close to eye level. Ron gives him a tentative wave.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey there, Ron. I can just tell you and I will be the best of friends.\u201d\n\u00a0\n***\n\u00a0\nThe ministry writes Harry in 1981 informing him that his version of muggle studies is now part of the required Hogwarts curriculum for all seven years.\n\u00a0\n***\n\u00a0\nTom spoons Harry in bed one night when they are both getting on in years and starting to learn what it means to have aching backs and creaking knees. \u201cTo think if I\u2019d never met you, I\u2019d be attempting to fight a war.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHarry looks up at the needlessly lavish precious stone mosaic of the ocean on their ceiling, glittering sapphires glinting orange from the dying embers in their marble fireplace.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou like this more?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI used to dream of being rich when I was young. Money is power darling, and power is all I have ever craved. We are wealthier than the Malfoys ever were.\u201d\n\u00a0\nOwning seven villas, six castles, and an ungodly collection of jewels was not what Harry had in mind when he introduced the wizarding world to economics, but he admits that even if he\u2019s not nearly as materialistic as Tom, nothing beats sex on a secluded island with a private view of a distant erupting volcano.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs a child raised in a cupboard, his life feels rather dreamlike, but Harry is coming to terms with it. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s hurting anyone by being rich and he and Tom donate plenty. More than anyone else in the wizarding world ever has.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cCome here,\u201d he whispers, and pulls Tom in for a kiss.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nFin\n"
