    "text": "Wei Wuxian is talking about nothing in particular. His whole body hurts\u2014especially where he\u00a0was\u00a0shot by that panicked GusuLan cultivator and the still-blistering burn on his chest where Wang LingJiao had pressed the iron seal. Lan Wangji is even worse off with his now broken and chewed up leg. At least he\u2019s not alone.\n\u201cDid you know I tried to raise a baby bird with my shijie before?\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cBut it really hated me. Like  hated  me-\u2014even more than you do\u2014well, you don\u2019t hate me that much anymore, right, Lan Zhan?\u201d\nLan Wangji never speaks much even on a good day, and under such circumstances, he\u2019s being even quieter than usual. So Wei Wuxian is talking about anything and everything that comes to mind, trying to keep both their minds off the pain and how they\u2019re probably going to die down here, which is, he\u2019s pretty sure, one of the top ways Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t want to go\u2014stuck with Wei Wuxian in a dirty cave.\n\u201cWhere are you going? Don\u2019t leave,\u201d Wei Wuxian blurts out\u00a0and grabs his arm when Lan Wangji moves. \u201cI\u2019ll stop being so annoying.\u201d\nLan Wangji gives him a look. \u201cIs that possible?\u201d he says.\nWei Wuxian laughs. \u201cIs that a joke, Lan Er-Gege?\u201d he asks. It hurts, but he moves closer to Lan Wangji, still holding onto his arm so he can\u2019t get away.\nLan Wangji tries to move further, but he hisses as soon as he shifts his leg. In the end, Wei Wuxian wins, leaning against Lan Wangji\u2019s side and smiling up at him. \u201cLend me some warmth, Lan Er-Gege. I sacrificed my robe for you, didn\u2019t I? I know you hate to be touched, but Xian-Xian is cold too, you know.\u201d\n\u201cShameless.\u201d Lan Wangji sends him a glare but stops trying to dislodge his grip.\nWei Wuxian grins and snuggles closer, holding onto Lan Wangji\u2019s arm and ready to put his head on his shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s more like it, Lan Zhan, be good to m\u2014OW!\u201d Wei Wuxian yells when Lan Wangji suddenly and without warning sinks his teeth into his arm, cutting off any other thoughts he has. \u201cAh stop! Stop stop stop!\u201d\nInstead of letting go, Lan Wangji sinks his teeth in even deeper and Wei Wuxian starts getting flashbacks to all the times he\u2019d been bitten just like this by the stray dogs on the streets he used to fight for food. \u201cOw! Ow! Ow! What are you a wild dog? Stop biting me!\u201d Wei Wuxian shrieks. \u201cI\u2019m going to kick you\u2014I\u2019ll really kick you even if you\u2019re injured! Stop! I\u2019ll go away! I\u2019ll go away!  Stop biting me!\u201d\nHis heart is pounding out of his chest when Lan Wangji has apparently satisfied himself and finally lets go.\nWei Wuxian immediately scoots several steps back to put himself safely out of reach of Lan Wangji\u2019s teeth. \u201cWhat was that for?\u201d he demands, nursing his now-sore arm.\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Lan Wangji says as suddenly as the bite came. His voice is quiet and low, his handsome face half hidden in the shadows of the flickering fire. After a moment, he adds, \u201cHow is your arm?\u201d\n\u201cHow do you think it is? Do you think I\u2019m not injured enough?\u201d Wei Wuxian massages his sore arm. \u201cThis will leave marks for sure.\u201d\n\u201cLet me see,\u201d Lan Wangji says.\nGiving him a wary look, Wei Wuxian slowly inches back over and holds out his hand.\nLan Wangji takes it, surprisingly gentle, and traces the clear imprints of teeth marks in the soft flesh of his arm.\u00a0Wei Wuxian\u2019s face begins to burn, feeling overly sensitive everywhere he touches. It takes every ounce of restraint to keep still.\nLan Wangji frowns. \u201cNot deep enough,\u201d he says.\nWei Wuxian snatches his hand back. \u201cJust how deep do you want to bite me?\u201d he demands.\n\u201cUntil it\u2019s permanent,\u201d Lan Wangji says.\nIn hindsight, that\u2019s probably the moment Wei Wuxian falls in love.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOver a week later, Wei Wuxian wakes up back in Lotus Pier with one hand gripped so tight to Lan Wangji\u2019s sleeve that his fingers are cramping, and the other wrapped around a large, bumpy rock.\nIt takes a few minutes of chaos and confusion before Wei Wuxian stops yelling and kicking, and only because one of his kicks\u00a0lands on Lan Wangji's\u00a0leg, and his sudden hiss of pain shocks Wei Wuxian out of attacking everything within reach.\n\u201cLan Zhan! Lan Zhan, are you okay? What happened?\u201d Wei Wuxian says, eyes wide as he stares at Lan Wangji.\n\u201cA-Xian, you\u2019re safe.\u201d\nWei Wuxian turns so fast the room spins, and it\u2019s only because Lan Wangji catches him and props him up that he doesn\u2019t fall again.\nJiang Yanli\u2019s face is in front of him when his vision stops spotting, and he blinks at her concerned expression. \u201cA-Xian, calm down,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re home. You\u2019re safe.\u201d\n\u201cIf they hadn\u2019t kicked you out of GusuLan for giving Jin ZiXuan a black eye, it was only a matter of time before they kicked you out for sheer stupidity.\u201d Wei Wuxian struggles to look around again and nearly elbows Lan Wangji in the\u00a0stomach.\n\u201cWhat are you a wild animal?\u201d Jiang Cheng snaps, peering around Jiang Yanli\u2019s shoulder. \u201cStay still or I\u2019ll break your legs.\u201d\n\u201cCalm down,\u201d Lan Wangji says. \u201cWe\u2019re safe.\u201d His voice, deep and pacifying, unlocks something in Wei Wuxian. With one of Lan Wangji\u2019s hands running soothingly down his arm, Wei Wuxian finally slows his breathing and slumps back against him.\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks once his heartbeat has returned to a normal rate. They\u2019re in his room back at Lotus Pier, he realizes, the sunlight streaming through the window in all the ways familiar to him.\n\u201cWe rescued you both obviously.\u201d Jiang Cheng looks down at the bed. \u201cYou held on to Lan Wangji so tight we had to bring you both back here. Just how long do you plan on holding his hand?\u201d he asks, raising an eyebrow. \u201cYou might want to cut his sleeves, but I\u2019m sure Second Master Lan would prefer we not.\u201d\nWei Wuxian looks down at the filthy sleeve he\u2019s holding and back up at Lan Wangji\u2019s face. He lets go of the sleeve. \u201cShut up, Jiang Cheng,\u201d he says, feeling the blood rush up to his face. \u201cWhat happened to the xuanwu?\u201d\n\u201cWen Chao claimed credit for it,\u201d Jiang Cheng says. \u201cWe got you two out right before they began trying to break into the cave to drag out the remains. You got your own piece of shit, though.\u201d He gestures to the rock Wei Wuxian realizes he\u2019s been clutching alongside Lan Wangji\u2019s hand.\nThe rock is about the size of a melon and three times as heavy. It\u2019s bumpy to the touch and warm from having been held in the cradle of Wei Wuxian\u2019s arm this whole time.\nHe remembers finding this egg when he was inside the xuanwu\u2019s shell, and thinking he might be able to hold it hostage or something to keep the xuanwu from attacking them. He\u2019d forgotten all about it when he\u2019d come across the old sword full of so much resentful energy he\u2019d nearly passed out. Apparently, he\u2019d lost the sword but kept the egg.\n\u201cWhy\u2019d you grab a piece of xuanwu shit anyway?\u201d Jiang Cheng asks.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an egg,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cA xuanwu egg.\u201d\nJiang Cheng raises an eyebrow. \u201cWhat kind of egg looks like that?\u201d he says.\n\u201cA-Cheng,\u201d Jiang Yanli chides. \u201cIt\u2019s a very nice egg,\u201d she tells Wei Wuxian.\n\u201cI still say it\u2019s shit,\u201d Jiang Cheng says.\n\u201cYou\u2019re  shit!\u201d Wei Wuxian answers with such vehemence he feels dizzy, and Lan Wangji\u2019s arm tightens around his shoulders where he\u2019s still supporting him.\n\u201cA-Cheng, let\u2019s let A-Xian and Second Master Lan rest,\u201d Jiang Yanli says. \u201cWe\u2019ll let the doctor know you\u2019re awake.\u201d She pauses at the door. \u201cPlease apologize when he comes in, A-Xian. You gave him a black eye when he tried to separate you two.\u201d She gives Wei Wuxian a smile and then pushes Jiang Cheng out the door, shutting it behind them.\nWei Wuxian\u2019s cheeks burns, and he lays down, curling up around the egg so he has an excuse to face away from Lan Wangji. \u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d he says which isn\u2019t a lie. \u201cWake me when the doctor comes,\u201d he mumbles and shuts his eyes.\nAs he\u2019s drifting back to sleep, he thinks he feels Lan Wangji trace the still-sensitive imprint of the bite mark on his arm. It feels nice.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSince Wei Wuxian suffers no broken bones, the doctor says he should recover quickly so long as he stays indoors and drinks the medicinal broth he\u2019s prescribing. Lan Wangji, on the other hand, gets sentenced to two months of bed rest.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll stay with us,\u201d Uncle Jiang decides. \u201cThe roads will be snowed in soon and travel will get worse. I\u2019ll inform your uncle,\u201d he tells Lan Wangji who looks like he wants to protest but can\u2019t when faced with a sect leader.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Lan Zhan, I\u2019ll take care of you like you took care of me,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. He\u2019d been worried that Lan Wangji would return to the Cloud Recesses.\u00a0With winter coming and the state of things still unstable there, Lan Wangji might not get all the care he needs. He justifies being weirdly protective of Lan Wangji as the natural result of having risked his life once to save him\u2014he doesn\u2019t want that to go to waste. \u201cAfter all, we\u2019re so close now,\u201d Wei Wuxian\u00a0says, beaming at him.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not close,\u201d Lan Wangji says.\n\u201cLan Zhan, I think almost being xuanwu dinner together is as close as two people can get,\u201d Wei Wuxian says amiably. \u201cWe even have an egg baby together.\u201d\n\u201cCan you call it something else?\u201d Lan Wangji says.\nWei Wuxian grins and winks at Lan Wangji. \u201cEgg baby. I\u2019ll let you choose if you want to be mom or dad,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t think we\u2019re close now, just you wait\u2014winter is coming, you have bed rest for two months, we are going to be  so  close,\u201d he says. \u201cBy the end of winter, I guarantee you will be saying we're close! The closest!\u201d he declares.\nLan Wangji winces.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to build a fire for our egg baby!\u201d Wei Wuxian announces.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re feeling better, A-Xian,\u201d Uncle Jiang says, clapping a hand on Wei Wuxian\u2019s shoulder. \u201cPlaying with your egg is fine, but don\u2019t forget to take care of your guest.\u201d\n\u201cI will!\u201d Wei Wuxian says enthusiastically.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWei Wuxian expects them to move Lan Wangji into his own guest room after it\u2019s been decided he\u2019ll stay. First, though, the main guest quarters get flooded thanks to a bad leak. Then, in the middle of repairs, one of the servants slips off the roof thanks to a patch of ice and breaks his arm. After that, the snows start in earnest and it\u2019s too dangerous for anyone to go up to repair things so Lan Wangji\u2019s stay in Wei Wuxian\u2019s bedroom grows from a few days to indefinite.\nSince it\u2019s not supposed to be a permanent arrangement and his\u00a0room is too small for it anyway, a second bed never gets moved in and Lan Wangji continues to share Wei Wuxian's bed. Wei Wuxian figures they\u2019ve already seen each other at their worst by now, so it shouldn\u2019t matter\u2014an opinion enforced when Lan Wangji stops shoving him away every time Wei Wuxian drapes himself over him.\nLan Wangji is a near perfect patient too. Now that they\u2019re out of danger and it looks like the QishanWen Sect is also snowed into Nightless City for the winter, Lan Wangji seems determined to recover as quickly as possible. He takes all the nasty medicinal broth without complaint, doesn\u2019t move around unnecessarily, and keeps the splint on his leg while\u00a0also exercising\u00a0it every day to keep the muscles from atrophying. He spends almost all his spare time cultivating in meditation.\nAfter a few days, their schedule settles into a routine. Lan Wangji is always meditating by the time breakfast is brought in and Wei Wuxian wakes in the morning\u2014even later than usual thanks to his own recovery and the winter gloom. At first, he drags himself up to serve Lan Wangji since he shouldn\u2019t move too much on his leg. But after a week or so, Wei Wuxian sleeps through the breakfast once and slowly comes to consciousness with Lan Wangji\u2019s deep, soothing voice in his ear telling him to wake up.\nWhen Wei Wuxian whines and buries his face in his pillow, he\u2019s both surprised and a little touched when Lan Wangji helps him sit up in bed, wipes his face clean with the towel and basin of water, and dresses him, all without him\u00a0having to lift a finger. It's maybe the most spoiled Wei Wuxian has ever been treated, and he likes it. Since Lan Wangji isn\u2019t moving unnecessarily, Wei Wuxian relaxes and sleeps in more every morning, letting Lan Wangji take care of him until he\u2019s ready to wake up.\nWei Wuxian\u2019s not sure if it\u2019s because they\u2019re no longer at the Cloud Recesses or because Lan Wangji is nicer now that they\u2019ve nearly died together. Either way, there are no rules to copy and Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t try to silence Wei Wuxian anymore. Since Wei Wuxian has been excused from winter lessons on account of his injuries and his unofficial duties entertaining Lan Wangji, he has nothing to do but fill the hours talking about whatever he wants to lying next to Lan Wangji in bed, occasionally changing bandages or waiting for servants to bring them meals and medicinal broth.\nOnce his fever completely recedes, Wei Wuxian convinces a few servants to lend him a small coal stove\u2014not because he's\u00a0cold since they have heated floors in the winter, but so he can try hatching the egg.\n\u201cIt won\u2019t hatch,\u201d Lan Wangji says when Wei Wuxian drags the stove\u00a0in.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know that,\u201d Wei Wuxian says.\n\u201cTortoises lay eggs in burrows to hatch,\u201d Lan Wangji answers, watching from the bed as Wei Wuxian loads the stove\u00a0with coal and carefully sets the blanket-swaddled egg nearby.\n\u201cBut this is a xuanwu egg,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cIt\u2019s not really a tortoise. Anyway, Shijie and I hatched a baby bird\u2019s egg when we were littler. I know how to do it.\u201d\nLan Wangji just gives him a long look, but lets Wei Wuxian arrange the egg by the stove.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t know what kind of egg it was,\u201d Wei Wuxian continues once he\u2019s done arranging and comes back to plop belly-down in bed. He props his head up on his hands and grins at Lan Wangji. \u201cActually, I accidentally disturbed a bird\u2019s nest when I was climbing a tree and it fell off,\u201d he admits. \u201cIt turned out to be a crow, and it didn\u2019t like me,\u201d he says, pouting.\n\u201cWhat did you do to it?\u201d Lan Wangji asks.\nWei Wuxian flops onto his back, tilting his head back so he can keep looking at Lan Wangji. \u201cWhy do you assume I did something to it? I treated it perfectly nicely! I just wanted to feed it some food\u2026\u201d\nWhen he trails off, Lan Wangji raises an eyebrow. \u201cSpicy?\u201d he says after a moment when Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t volunteer the information.\nWei Wuxian rolls over again and mumbles into the pillow. \u201cHow was I supposed to know it wouldn\u2019t like it?\u201d\nLan Wangji actually has the audacity to snort\u2014just a small one, but a snort nonetheless.\n\u201cI was only eight or nine! I only just came to Lotus Pier!\u201d Wei Wuxian says, rolling again so he can look at Lan Wangji. \u201cStop making fun of me!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d Lan Wangji is looking down at him with a slightly raised eyebrow as though to say it serves you right.\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking at me like you are,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. He's\u00a0delighted at the discovery that although Lan Wangji\u2019s expression barely looks any different from usual, he\u2019s finally familiar enough with Lan Wangji to tell what he\u2019s thinking.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs a high calibre cultivator, after two weeks pass, Lan Wangji\u2019s injuries have healed enough that the doctor says he can walk short distances if he\u2019s very careful, which means he begins joining the Jiang family at dinner as an honored guest.\nSince Lan Wangji\u2019s GusuLan uniform was completely destroyed in the cave, he\u2019s given a set of purple YunmengJiang robes to borrow while he\u2019s staying at Lotus Pier. Wei Wuxian swears he\u2019s never seen anyone look so proper and handsome in a YunmengJiang uniform before. Since his forehead ribbon was equally destroyed during that incident and Lan Wangji can\u2019t wear it, apart from the lack of a bell, he looks the perfect picture of an ideal YunmengJiang disciple.\nWei Wuxian thinks it might be the first time he\u2019s ever seen Madam Yu approve of anyone.\n\u201cLook at how he wears the uniform. Not one wrinkle,\u201d she says to Wei Wuxian almost immediately when they come into the dining hall. \u201cThat\u2019s the proper way to dress!\u201d\nShe also comments on Lan Wangji's\u00a0perfect posture when he sits, how he doesn\u2019t speak at all when he eats, how poised he is even holding chopsticks. She seems ready to adopt him\u00a0and have him become her model disciple like he already is for Lan Qiren\u2014apparently it\u2019s a common sentiment among the older generation when they see Lan Wangji.\nAfter that, Madam Yu stops comparing Jiang Cheng to Wei Wuxian all the time, and begins comparing Wei Wuxian to Lan Wangji instead. But since Lan Wangji\u2019s level of perfection is unachievable by mere mortals, Wei Wuxian really just mentally agrees with her every time she compliments him.\nFamily dinners become much more peaceful.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOne night, about a month in, Wei Wuxian whines to Lan Wangji that it\u2019s too hot in the room.\n\u201cPut out the stove,\u201d Lan Wangji answers.\n\u201cBut our xuanwu won\u2019t hatch then,\u201d Wei Wuxian says and pouts. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep. It\u2019s too warm.\u201d He kicks the blankets\u00a0to the end of the bed.\nEarlier Jiang Cheng had pulled Wei Wuxian aside after he\u2019d shamelessly draped himself on Lan Wangji on their way back from dinner and asked his Lan Er-Gege to carry him.\n\u201cWho\u2019s the injured one with the  broken leg?\u201d Jiang Cheng lectured him when Lan Wangji had walked out of earshot.\n\u201cLan Zhan knows I\u2019m just kidding,\u201d Wei Wuxian said.\n\u201cAre you?\u201d Jiang Cheng said. \u201cAnyway, stop flirting so much. Are you a girl? It gives me goosebumps every time you open your mouth around him.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re friends, Jiang Cheng,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, rolling his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re just jealous you don\u2019t have your own GusuLan friend\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAre you trying to tell me you\u2019d do this with any random GusuLan cultivator?\u201d Jiang Cheng demanded.\nWei Wuxian didn\u2019t quite have a comeback to that because Lan Wangji has never been a random GusuLan cultivator to him\u2014no other cultivator in the world could possibly compare to Lan Wangji\u2019s deity-like appearance or his talent or his hard work or his inherent righteousness. He is literally the most perfect human being Wei Wuxian has ever met, and the only time he acts a little more reachable is when Wei Wuxian annoys him, which is most effective via flirting. Lan Wangji has the best reactions and teasing him is  fun.\nHe told\u00a0Jiang Cheng so, but the pointed snort he got\u00a0was anything but satisfying.\nSo ever since\u00a0he returned\u00a0to their room, Wei Wuxian has felt the need to prove something.\n\u201cLet me lie in your lap,\u201d Wei Wuxian whines, inching over.\n\u201cWon\u2019t that make you feel hotter?\u201d Lan Wangji asks.\n\u201cIt will make me feel better,\u201d Wei Wuxian says and without waiting for a response, puts his head down on Lan Wangji\u2019s thigh.\nLan Wangji is, of course, right, and within moments, Wei Wuxian feels his face heating up. But Lan Wangji also doesn\u2019t move away. Instead, his hand comes to stroke Wei Wuxian\u2019s hair and then down his arm where the imprints of his teeth marks have finally faded.\nWei Wuxian drifts off to sleep too warm and still annoyed at Jiang Cheng.\nMaybe because of the position, or maybe because of Lan Wangji\u2019s touch, that night, he dreams about the Xuanwu Cave. In the dream, Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t bite him like he did in reality, but he still cries because his father is dying, brother is missing, the Cloud Recesses are burned, the rest of the sect is in hiding. Although in real life at the time, Wei Wuxian had sat some distance away, arm throbbing from being bitten and unsure of how to comfort Lan Wangji, in the dream, his chest aches at seeing Lan Wangji this way and he pulls him into his arms. He kisses Lan Wangji first on his eyelashes, then down the wet tracks of tears on his face, then the corner of his mouth. Lan Wangji\u2019s golden eyes stare at him, Wei Wuxian\u2019s heart pounds in his chest as he leans in\u2014and Lan Wangji bites him hard on the ass.\nWei Wuxian yells and jumps up.\nFor a moment, there\u2019s total panic and confusion. Wei Wuxian elbows Lan Wangji in the gut, and Lan Wangji leaps out of bed, unsheathing Bichen as he goes.\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d Lan Wangji says.\nWei Wuxian, still in bed, has reached for Suibian though he hasn\u2019t drawn it yet.\nFor a moment, in the dark of the night, Wei Wuxian can\u2019t sense any enemies, and yet his ass still stings from where he was bitten.\nThen, from beside the bed, Wei Wuxian hears a gravelly growl. Lan Wangji is already lighting a lamp before Wei Wuxian can reach for it.\nWhen he looks down, by the edge of the bed, a small xuanwu about the size of a cat has its front legs propped up on the bed so its long, snake-like neck can reach the top of the blankets. Its big, shiny eyes blink up at Wei Wuxian, and it lets out a low, gravelly honk.\nWei Wuxian\u2019s whole heart melts. \u201cLan Zhan, our egg hatched,\u201d he breathes. \u201cLook at it! It\u2019s so cute!\u201d He reaches out to pet it.\nThe xuanwu takes one look at Wei Wuxian, snaps out its neck, jaws opened wide, and chomps down on Wei Wuxian\u2019s hand.\nWei Wuxian yells and scrambles to hide behind Lan Wangji, trembling from head to foot. \u201cIt\u2019s just like a dog! Why is our baby just like a dog?\u201d he demands.\nThe xuanwu seems to look consideringly at the two of them. First is Lan Wangji, dressed all in white with Bichen still drawn, as frosty as the snow outside. And then there's Wei Wuxian, cowering behind him.\nIt tries to reach around Lan Wangji to bite Wei Wuxian again.\nWei Wuxian shrieks and hides behind Lan Wangji. \u201cSave me! Save me, Lan Zhan!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou hatched a what?\u201d Madam Yu demands\u00a0when news spreads of the xuanwu that has hatched in Wei Wuxian\u2019s room during the night. She makes a rare visit to see them, and stares down at the xuanwu that tilts its head to look up at her, utterly unintimidated.\n\u201cWei Wuxian, is it not enough that you have shamed yourself out of the Cloud Recesses,\u201d she says, \u201cThat you have brought disaster to YunmengJing because you had to show off at the archery competition. That the QishanWen Sect is probably planning who knows what because of your rebellion at Dusk-Creek Mountain. And now you have  hatched  a  xuanwu  in  Lotus Pier?\u201d\nJiang Cheng coughs. \u201cIt\u2019s not completely his fault, A-Niang,\u201d he says. \u201cWe brought the egg back when we rescued them.\u201d\n\u201cBecause he wouldn\u2019t let go of it!\u201d Madam Yu shrieks. \u201cWho asked you to hatch it?\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it kind of cute?\u201d Jiang Yanli tries.\nThe xuanwu looks like a hideous mix between a tortoise and a snake, Wei Wuxian has decided after being bitten multiple times. Not one part of it could be considered cute by anyone apart from Jiang Yanli.\nMadam Yu puts a hand to her temple and massages it.\n\u201cYou hatched it. You take care of it,\u201d she orders. \u201cI better not see it around or causing any sort of trouble, or I\u2019ll kick you both out like I should have done long ago!\u201d\nWei Wuxian stares tearfully at\u00a0the xuanwu that eyes him like it wants to take another bite, and shivers behind Lan Wangji. \u201cI don\u2019t want it,\u201d he says.\nMadam Yu narrows a glare at him. \u201cThen kill it and eat it for all I care,\u201d she says heartlessly and marches out of the room.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOf course they don\u2019t kill or eat it.\nHaving spent over a month hatching it, even though Wei Wuxian breaks out into a cold sweat every time the little monster\u2019s mouth opens too close to him, he can\u2019t bring himself to actually get rid of it.\nSo instead, they have to figure out what it eats.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t feed it human corpses,\u201d he decides right away.\n\u201cWhy would you even consider that?\u201d Jiang Cheng says.\nWei Wuxian shrugs. \u201cThat\u2019s what its mom ate,\u201d he says. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s why it\u2019s already so evil.\"\nThe xuanwu narrows its eyes at Wei Wuxian as though considering where to bite him next.\nWei Wuxian edges a little closer to Lan Wangji. \u201cWhat should we feed it?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we each try something until it eats,\u201d Jiang Yanli suggests.\nWei Wuxian feels horribly betrayed when she bends down and the xuanwu lets her pat it on the head and then scratch under its chin. It makes a pleased little clicking sound and its eyes close in satisfaction.\n\u201cAww, you\u2019re so cute, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Jiang Yanli coos.\n\u201cYou may as well give up being mom now.\u201d Jiang Cheng elbows Wei Wuxian in the side. \u201cLooks like your child only likes A-Jie.\u201d\nWei Wuxian stomps off to find something for it to eat.\nWhen the four of them meet back in Wei Wuxian\u2019s room an hour later, the xuanwu stares curiously at the array of more or less edible items. Jiang Yanli goes first, giving the xuanwu a few dried lotus seeds which it tastes but spits back out again.\n\u201cI could only find dry ones in the storehouse,\u201d Jiang Yanli says sadly. \u201cMaybe it likes fresh ones like A-Xian.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a xuanwu! It likes meat, A-Jie,\u201d Jiang Cheng says and waves a bloody piece of chicken at it. The xuanwu hisses at him and turns its head when Jiang Cheng tries shoving the chicken at it.\n\u201cMaybe you should have cooked it, A-Cheng?\u201d Jiang Yanli suggests.\n\u201cI cooked something!\u201d Wei Wuxian says proudly and holds out his offering, which is so red it\u2019s hard to tell what it actually is.\n\u201cWhy do you try to feed  every  animal your horror food?\u201d Jiang Cheng demands. \u201cDidn\u2019t you kill that bird you hatched last time?\u201d\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t die!\u201d Wei Wuxian says.\nThe xuanwu takes one look at the plate and turns beseeching eyes toward Lan Wangji.\n\u201cUngrateful,\u201d Wei Wuxian says and takes a spoonful of his own food to taste. \u201cThis is good! There\u2019s nothing wrong with it!\u201d he says after swallowing.\n\u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with  you,\u201d Jiang Cheng says.\nLan Wangji has many unfair qualities like being devastatingly handsome, having one of the highest cultivation levels of their generation, and being good at literally everything he tries to do. This,\u00a0apparently, includes animal taming as they find out when the xuanwu eats out of the palm of Lan Wangji\u2019s hand. Literally. Lan Wangji slowly feeds it big pieces of the lettuce he brought back, and the xuanwu chomps enthusiastically at the vegetables, making pleased little honking noises between bites.\n\u201cLettuce?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks. \u201cHow did you know it would like lettuce?\u201d\nLan Wangji glances at him and pulls a thin book out of his robe. \u201cLibrary,\u201d he answers.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOver the next day, Lan Wangji teaches them all how to tame animals.\n\u201cBe patient,\u201d Lan Wangji instructs Wei Wuxian from where he\u2019s kneeling on the ground, a little distance from the xuanwu who is eyeing the four of them warily. \u201cWait for it to come to you.\u201d\nWei Wuxian tries\u2014he really tries to hold still, but asking him to hold still for more than five minutes is really asking the impossible. \u201cMy legs are going numb like this,\u201d he complains.\nLike it was waiting for the opportunity, the xuanwu darts out. Only thanks to quick action, Wei Wuxian saves himself from another bite by ducking behind Lan Wangji. \u201cKeep still,\u201d Lan Wangji says. \u201cIt takes time for it to get used to you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m its  mother, it should already be used to me,\u201d Wei Wuxian says.\n\u201cSecond Master Lan, how do you know so much about animal taming?\u201d Jiang Yanli asks softly from her position where she\u2019s kept so still that the xuanwu has started getting curious and is heading in her direction. Of course that\u2019s hardly a feat since it took a liking to Jiang Yanli immediately, and she\u2019s already pet it multiple times.\nLan Wangji coughs and Wei Wuxian would swear he looks embarrassed. \u201cWei Ying gave me rabbits,\u201d he confesses.\nWei Wuxian stares at him and then breaks into a wide grin. \u201cYou kept them? Lan Zhan, I can\u2019t believe you really kept them!\u201d He throws his arms around Lan Wangji\u2019s neck only for the xuanwu to startle at the noise and turn its beady eyes on Wei Wuxian again. \u201cHow did you convince your uncle to let you keep them? Ah, I want to visit the Cloud Recesses again!\u201d he says and quickly ducks behind Lan Wangji when the xuanwu begins heading in his direction again.\n\u201cWe should have raised bunnies instead of a xuanwu,\u201d Wei Wuxian mutters into Lan Wangji\u2019s back.\n\u201cYou\u2019d probably have found a way to annoy them too.\u201d Jiang Cheng snorts. \u201cYou\u2019re cursed with animals.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs the days pass, they discover the xuanwu likes most vegetables, fresh lotus seeds but not dried ones, and really likes longan fruit although it\u2019s too lazy to peel them by itself.\nOne week in and Jiang Yanli has named the xuanwu \u201cXuan-Xuan\u201d and likes to call both \u201cXian-Xian\u201d and \u201cXuan-Xuan\u201d when she\u2019s made snacks, which is often sweet longan soup since everyone, including the xuanwu, likes it.\nThey also discover the xuanwu hates being alone and will scramble after Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian whenever they leave the room. The first time they forget to lock it in the bedroom, it follows them all the way to the dinner. Although Wei Wuxian scolds it and tells it not to enter the dining hall or Madam Yu will have it for dinner, the xuanwu makes loud, sad honks until Jiang Yanli can bear it no longer and goes to open the door.\n\u201cSo this is Xuan-Xuan?\u201d Uncle Jiang looks amused at the xuanwu that comes scrambling inside, curiously looking around.\nMadam Yu\u2019s eyes narrow and she\u2019s about to order the cooks to carry it off to the kitchens when the xuanwu chooses that moment to take a large bite out of Wei Wuxian\u2019s thigh.\nWei Wuxian yelps and scrambles behind Lan Wangji.\nJiang Yanli and Jiang Cheng look nervously between Wei Wuxian and their mother.\nMadam Yu opens her mouth, and everyone stares when she starts to laugh. \u201cFinally someone here that wild animal will fear,\u201d she says, and she\u2019s not looking at the xuanwu when she says so.\nAfter that, she seems to take a liking to the xuanwu even though she won\u2019t admit it. But Wei Wuxian sees her secretly sneaking longans to the xuanwu every time it wanders near her, and she never tries to lock it outside during dinnertime anymore.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLike Lan Wangji said, though, slowly the xuanwu begins to accept Wei Wuxian.\nAs the days pass, Wei Wuxian patiently feeds it lettuce leaves in their room, rewarding it with scratches under its chin when it\u2019s being good, and the xuanwu stops trying to bite Wei Wuxian all the time, settling for little nibbles on his fingers when it wants attention.\n\u201cGood girl, Xuan-Xuan. That\u2019s more like it,\u201d Wei Wuxian says when it tugs on his robe for Wei Wuxian to feed it a longan he\u2019s just peeled. \u201cLan Zhan is the only one who can bite me after all,\u201d he says and shoots a sly grin at Lan Wangji whose earlobes turn red. \u201cWhy are you looking so embarrassed, Hanguang-Jun?\u201d he teases, delighted. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t think it was proper, you shouldn\u2019t have done it in the first place.\u201d\n\u201cBe quiet,\u201d Lan Wangji says.\nWei Wuxian laughs and falls back, landing in Lan Wangji\u2019s lap. \u201cAre you being shy, Lan Er-Gege? No, don\u2019t look away,\u201d he says. \u201cLook at me, Lan Zhan. Look at your Wei Ying.\u201d\nHe feels warm all the way to his toes when Lan Wangji does.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThanks to overfeeding, the xuanwu grows by leaps and bounds. Before a month is out, it\u2019s at double its originally size and no amount of closed doors can keep it out when it\u2019s determined to get in. Wei Wuxian tries riding on its back one day, and although the xuanwu ignores every direction Wei Wuxian tries to give it, it does carry him all around Lotus Pier like a short donkey.\nBy then, Wei Wuxian is used to splitting his day between taking care of Lan Wangji and taking care of the xuanwu.\nHe likes spending time with Lan Wangji, and if sometimes he finds himself lying on Lan Wangji at night instead of his own side of the bed, it\u2019s just because Lan Wangji is so much warmer and more comfortable to lie on. And if he\u2019s caught himself staring starry-eyed at Lan Wangji when the light hits him just right, it\u2019s because Lan Wangji is objectively gorgeous and Wei Wuxian really only has so long to enjoy such a view of perfect beauty. And if he\u2019s increasingly relieved every morning when he wakes up and there\u2019s still snow on the ground meaning Lan Wangji\u2019s inevitable departure is put off for yet another day, it\u2019s only because they\u2019re friends now\u2014maybe even close friends and being with Lan Wangji just makes him really happy.\nIt\u2019s all perfectly normal.\n\u201cIt is not normal,\u201d Jiang Cheng tells him point blank when Lan Wangji is out one day. The weather has been mild for a few days now, and that afternoon, a letter came from GusuLan. While Lan Wangji goes to discuss potential departure plans with Uncle Jiang, Wei Wuxian drags Jiang Yanli and Jiang Cheng out to a private patio and has a minor meltdown.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not  not  normal, right?\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cIt\u2019s winter. It\u2019s cold. Lan Wangji might look like he can freeze ice, but he\u2019s actually very warm and comfortable. You should try it.\u201d\n\u201cYou want me to try cuddling with him?\u201d Jiang Cheng says.\nThe mental image makes Wei Wuxian grimace for more than just one reason. \u201cOkay, maybe not,\u201d he says.\n\u201cSince when did you become a cutsleeve?\u201d Jiang Cheng accuses him.\n\u201cLan Wangji isn\u2019t a cutsleeve,\u201d Wei Wuxian says.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say  he\u2019s a cutsleeve, I said  you\u2019re  a cutsleeve,\u201d Jiang Cheng says, narrowing his eyes.\nWei Wuxian really wants to deny that statement, but he also can\u2019t stop thinking about how it had taken him a full hour to extricate himself from Lan Wangji\u2019s arms that morning because it felt so nice, and how he\u2019s not sure he can even sleep without Lan Wangji to hug anymore. \u201cShijie, I\u2019m not a cutsleeve, right?\u201d he asks the more sympathetic of his two siblings instead.\nJiang Yanli pauses. \u201cA-Xian, do you like Second Master Lan?\u201d she asks.\n\u201cOf course I like him,\u201d Wei Wuxian answers. \u201cWe\u2019re friends.\u201d\n\u201cWould you like to be more than that?\u201d Jiang Yanli asks delicately.\nWei Wuxian turns the idea over in his mind. \u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d he decides finally. \u201cI\u2019ve never thought about you know...doing anything\u2026\u201d he says, conveniently forgetting that one time he\u2019d dreamed about kissing Lan Wangji. Maybe even more than once by now.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take him on a date?\u201d Jiang Yanli suggests. \u201cIf you both enjoy it, maybe you can discuss the possibilities.\u201d\nWei Wuxian hesitates. \u201cBut what if Lan Zhan doesn\u2019t like...it?\u201d he says finally. It\u2019s hard to force the words out.\nJiang Yanli smiles. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how much longer Second Master Lan will be able to stay here,\u201d she says. \u201cBesides, you\u2019ve always wanted to show him around Yunmeng, right?\u201d She reaches out and pats him on the hand. \u201cIt will be all right.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if he breaks your heart, I\u2019ll break his leg,\u201d Jiang Cheng says. \u201cAgain.\u201d\nWei Wuxian laughs.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWei Wuxian doesn\u2019t technically call it a date. He doesn\u2019t technically invite Lan Wangji out either. After Lan Wangji comes back from talking to Uncle Jiang, Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t let him get a word in edgewise before declaring they\u2019re going to visit Yunmeng, and drags him out.\nThe xuanwu, who had followed Lan Wangji to his meeting and back, continues following them all the way to the gate. It complains loudly when Wei Wuxian tells it that it can\u2019t come.\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s too cold for you still, Xuan-Xuan. You\u2019re a cold-blooded animal, after all. You\u2019ll just freeze to death.\u201d Wei Wuxian finds himself lecturing the xuanwu. \u201cWe\u2019ll be back soon and we\u2019ll see if we can bring you back a snack. Maybe candied ginger,\u201d he says. \u201cYou liked ginger last time.\u201d\nThe xuanwu makes makes another honk of discontent, but stops trying to follow them out.\n\u201cWei Ying, about my discussion\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s go, Lan Zhan!\u201d Wei Wuxian interrupts him, grabbing Lan Wangji by the hand. \u201cDo you remember when I invited you here back when I was studying at the Cloud Recesses? You probably don\u2019t remember, but I really wanted to take you around Yunmeng.\u201d He takes a deep breath and smiles up at him. \u201cSo let\u2019s just enjoy today, okay?\u201d\nLan Wangji looks at him. Wei Wuxian is very aware of the warmth of Lan Wangji\u2019s hand clasped in his own. Finally, Lan Wangji nods. \u201cMm,\u201d he agrees.\nHaving been granted permission, Wei Wuxian takes Lan Wangji to a small, rare frozen pond on the outskirts of Yunmeng.\n\u201cYou said ponds do not freeze here,\u201d Lan Wangji says.\n\u201cDid I say that?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks, trying to remember when he might have told Lan Wangji that piece of information. \u201cWell, I meant most of them don\u2019t freeze\u2014they\u2019re too big or there\u2019s a water source at the bottom, but sometimes we get lucky,\u201d he says. \u201cI made one of my shidi keep an eye out\u2014you won\u2019t believe how crowded a frozen pond can get when everyone finds out about it!\u201d he says and steps out onto the thick ice, testing his weight on it.\nLan Wangji hovers by the side of the pond as though ready to pull Wei Wuxian to safety if the ice suddenly cracks.\n\u201cCome out, it\u2019s safe,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, jumping a few times to make his point.\nSlowly, Lan Wangji steps out onto the pond.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t let you fall,\u201d Wei Wuxian says and reaches to hold his\u00a0hand. As pale as his skin is, Lan Wangji\u2019s fingers are warm when they wrap around his.\nWei Wuxian smiles at him and pulls him forward on the pond.\nIt\u2019s not until a half hour in, when Lan Wangji steadies Wei Wuxian as he slips on a patch of ice, that he realizes Gusu is north of Yunmeng and far colder in the winter.\n\u201cWait, you were never in danger of falling were you, Lan Zhan?\u201d Wei Wuxian accuses him. \u201cYou let me hold your hand this whole time but you probably have so many frozen ponds and lakes up in Gusu. You\u2019re a better skater than I am!\u201d He wags his free hand at Lan Wangji. \u201cYou just wanted to hold my hand, didn\u2019t you?\u201d he says slyly.\n\u201cI have never gone skating,\u201d Lan Wangji says but\u00a0doesn\u2019t let go of Wei Wuxian\u2019s hand.\n\u201cNever?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks. \u201cEven Jiang Cheng said he went skating with other disciples when he was studying there! We have to go next time!\u201d he says. \u201cSkating in Gusu must be so much fun!\u201d\n\u201cIf you want,\u201d Lan Wangji says.\n\u201cLan Zhan, Lan Zhan, look at me,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, letting go of Lan Wangji\u2019s hand so he can skate forward, dragging Suibian along the ice in the thinnest scrapes until he\u2019s carved \u2018Lan Er-Gege~\u2661\u2019 into the\u00a0surface.\nHe laughs as he skates back to Lan Wangji and is about to throw himself into his arms when he hears such a loud shout that he jumps and loses his balance for real.\nInstead of landing hard on the ice, he feels a pair of arms come to wrap around his waist, and he faceplants into soft winter robes. When he straightens up again, he catches his breath. There, surrounded by the glittering white landscape, Lan Wangji is holding onto him, backlit by the sun and looking like a young prince in his purple robes. Wei Wuxian smiles automatically before he jumps again when his name is shouted.\n\u201cWei Wuxian! What the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d Jiang Cheng shouts. \u201cLan Wangji\u2019s injuries just healed! Do you want to break his leg again, you absolute moron?\u201d\n\u201cYou told me to take Lan Zhan out,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. He can feel Lan Wangji\u2019s eyes burning into the back of his head, but he refuses to turn around and explain himself.\n\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to help make him better not worse!\u201d Jiang Cheng says. \u201cGood thing A-Jie sent me to check on you after Liu-shidi said he told you about the frozen pond. Get your ass back here or I\u2019ll break both  your  legs and see how you like it!\u201d\nWei Wuxian is both pleased and amused to find Lan Wangji\u2019s arms tighten around his waist as though intending to protect him from Jiang Cheng\u2019s wrath.\n\u201cFine, fine, we\u2019ll stop skating. Happy? I\u2019m going to take Lan Zhan to town.\u201d He grabs Lan Wangji by the hand again, ignoring the look Jiang Cheng gives him, and pulls him\u00a0off the frozen pond. \u201cYou can go home first,\u201d he tells Jiang Cheng. \u201cTell your mom we\u2019ll get dinner out so you don\u2019t have to wait for us.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not your errand boy!\u201d Jiang Cheng shouts.\nSince it\u2019s been some time since he\u2019s gone around the city, having been cooped up in Lotus Pier all winter, Wei Wuxian\u00a0takes his time showing Lan Wangji all the places he likes to go. He shows him his favorite food stands, he points out the farm where he once convinced Jiang Cheng to steal chickens with him, and he shows him a tiny graffitied picture left on a wall from the last time Wei Wuxian had been dared by a younger shidi to carve a picture in.\nWei Wuxian stops beneath the tree where he\u2019d accidentally jostled loose the bird nest so many years ago. It had been the same tree Jiang Yanli once found him in and promised there would be no dogs before he would come back down.\nSince Lan Wangji has already heard the first story, he tells him the second one now as he crouches down, absently playing with the snow and making a small snow-xuanwu.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe the xuanwu takes after you and likes to bite me too,\u201d Wei Wuxian says as he straightens up again.\nLan Wangji, who has been quietly listening to him, reaches for his hand to help him up. \u201cDoes it still hurt?\u201d he asks after a moment.\nWei Wuxian blinks at him. \u201cWhat? The bite? Of course not\u2014that was so long ago,\u201d he says, smiling.\nLan Wangji holds his hand, looking at it. \u201c...I should bite again,\u201d he says.\n\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d Wei Wuxian tries to withdraw his hand.\nLan Wangji holds tight to him, refusing to let him go. \u201cIt\u2019s my oath to you,\u201d he says quietly.\nIt takes Wei Wuxian a few moments to remember the saying and understand. \u201cOath...an oath through a bite of the arm?\u201d It\u2019s an idiom that means an \u201carmed alliance\u201d\u2014in other words, complete loyalty to the oath of alliance for life. He laughs. \u201cCan\u2019t you use your words instead of actions sometimes? Are you a wild animal? You could just say it.\u201d\n\u201cWords are the source of misunderstanding,\u201d Lan Wangji says. Instead, he raises Wei Wuxian\u2019s hand to his lips. Wei Wuxian\u2019s hands are so cold from playing in the snow that he can only feel the slightest pressure as Lan Wangji bites down gently on the tip of his finger. \u201cNo matter what,\u201d he says, a strange intensity burning in his eyes. \u201cI...to you\u2026\u201d He can\u2019t seem to find the right words to say, but Wei Wuxian thinks Lan Wangji might be right about actions, because he can feel the warmth spread from his thawing fingers right up to his ears.\n\u201cAh, my hands are so cold. Let\u2019s go somewhere indoors!\u201d Wei Wuxian says, heart thumping hard and holding tight to Lan Wangji\u2019s hand as he pulls him into a nearby restaurant. He orders two portions of the spicy wonton soup he wants Lan Wangji to try there.\nIt\u2019s definitely not only the cold that stains Wei Wuxian\u2019s cheeks red\u2014he can admit at least that much to himself as his hand stays in Lan Wangji\u2019s steady grip.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBy the time they return to Lotus Pier late that night, Wei Wuxian has confirmed that he is definitely, undoubtedly, more than a little in love with Lan Wangji, and he is completely sure that he wants to do all sorts of things with him particularly in bed. It is extremely convenient that they already share one, he thinks, as he pushes Lan Wangji and follows him down, sitting in his lap. Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t push him away. Instead, his hands settle on his hips, and Wei Wuxian feels like his whole body is aware of everything as he tilts Lan Wangji\u2019s face up so he can look into those beautiful golden eyes.\n\u201cLan Zhan, you don\u2019t hate me, right?\u201d Wei Wuxian blurts out.\nLan Wangji\u2019s eyebrows furrow. \u201cNo,\u201d he says.\n\u201cNo you don\u2019t hate me or no you hate me? I know you don\u2019t like to talk, but sometimes I need words too, you know,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, heart pounding as his hands slide down to fist in Lan Wangji\u2019s outer robe. \u201cDon\u2019t just answer my question like that\u2014can\u2019t you be more clear? I\u2019m so nervous, I\u2019m\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI like you,\u201d Lan Wangji says firmly.\n\u201cOh thank god,\u201d Wei Wuxian says and kisses him.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWei Wuxian learns many new things about Lan Wangji that night. He finds out that this is Lan Wangji\u2019s first time kissing anyone, and his first time going to bed with anyone. He finds out that for all that Lan Wangji looks perfectly composed on the outside, he is absolutely not composed at all when Wei Wuxian whispers to him\u00a0that it\u2019s also his first kiss and his first time. He can\u2019t help laughing and gasping at the same time when Lan Wangji gets even bigger inside of him. He finds out that Lan Wangji\u2019s level of cultivation is apparently in direct proportion to his stamina, because three rounds later, Wei Wuxian is begging for mercy, but Lan Wangji is still insatiable as he twists two fingers inside Wei Wuxian. It\u2019s making his dick jump at the same time as he\u2019s so exhausted he really can\u2019t go anymore no matter how much he wants to continue with Lan Zhan.\nHis ass is only saved when the xuanwu barges in and honks for treats, completely ignoring Lan Wangji\u2019s glare as Wei Wuxian scrambles to the side of bed to reach for the candied ginger they bought on their way back.\n\u201cGood girl, Xuan-Xuan,\u201d Wei Wuxian tells it, nudging away\u00a0Lan Wangji\u2019s hand that\u2019s creeping lower on his back as he feeds the xuanwu another piece of ginger.\nThe xuanwu makes a happy noise and plops its head, now as big as a grapefruit, on Wei Wuxian\u2019s knee.\nLan Wangji sighs and drapes himself behind Wei Wuxian, arms circling around his waist. Wei Wuxian leans back into him, smiling as he kisses him on the cheek, and thinks he really can\u2019t imagine life being any better.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAfter that, the weather quickly warms. The snow melts and the lotus ponds all come back to life. The xuanwu is now so big that it\u2019s a relief for everyone when it takes enthusiastically to the lake and can often be spotted swimming around Lotus Pier, casually eating lotuses by the mouthful as it goes.\nWei Wuxian finds out that Madam Yu has been spending more time than she\u2019d like to admit with the xuanwu when he discovers she\u2019s secretly trained it to hiss at any disciple caught loafing\u00a0around Lotus Pier. In her free time, she can be seen standing on its back, holding a parasol over her head to shield from the sun, and ordering it to patrol the piers for slackers.\nIt gets so none of the disciples dare to play anywhere visible from the lake, much to Madam Yu\u2019s delight.\nWei Wuxian doesn\u2019t really care. Every one of Madam Yu\u2019s criticisms of him roll of his shoulders even moreso than usual because he can\u2019t be anything but effervescently happy with Lan Wangji. They\u2019re together all of the time, reluctant to let go of each other even to bathe or get dressed.\nMadam Yu seems torn between getting mad that Wei Wuxian is in a loving, happy relationship, or if she wants to approve of it because securing ties with GusuLan\u2014particularly after Wei Wuxian\u2019s fiasco studying there\u2014could be nothing but good news with the unrest amongst the cultivation territories.\n\u201cIf it strengthens ties with GusuLan, it might be a good thing, but if Lan Qiren thinks Wei Wuxian is harassing his star pupil, it might make things worse when he has to return to the Cloud Recesses,\u201d Wei Wuxian overhears Madam Yu saying to Uncle Jiang one afternoon. He and Lan Wangji happen to be walking a few pavilions away, but sound travels clearly over the calm lake. \u201cLan Wangji has already stayed with us all winter\u2014they don\u2019t need to be in a relationship for us to secure ties with GusuLan after this favor.\u201d\nWei Wuxian tightens his grip around Lan Wangji\u2019s hand and his footsteps stall.\n\u201cA-Xian and Second Master Lan are the ones who will have to spend their lives together,\u201d Uncle Jiang says gently. \u201cLet them decide who they like.\u201d\n\u201cUnlike us, you mean?\u201d Madam Yu says.\n\u201cSan-Niang, you know that\u2019s not what I meant,\u201d Uncle Jiang says.\nMadam Yu stands at the pavilion. \u201cAll you\u2019ve done ever since he came here is to protect him, spoil him rotten\u2014well, it\u2019s about time he made some sacrifices for YunmengJiang, or isn\u2019t he the head disciple?\u201d she says.\n\u201cI won\u2019t allow you to come between them if they love each other,\u201d Uncle Jiang says, also getting to his feet.\nSomething falls from the table and Wei Wuxian hears a sharp crack.\n\u201cMy hairpin!\u201d Madam Yu says. She lets out a bitter laugh. \u201cSo now because of him, you\u2019re even breaking my things.\u201d\n\u201cSan-Niang!\u201d Uncle Jiang calls, but Madam Yu is already walking away.\nWei Wuxian pulls Lan Wangji into the shadows with him before Madam Yu turns their way. He has one brief moment where he wonders if what she\u00a0said was right\u2014if he\u2019s the one whose been harassing Lan Wangji all this time, if Lan Qiren might be so angry that he refuses to ally with YunmengJiang because Wei Wuxian corrupted his favorite disciple. But with Lan Wangji right here in front of him, Wei Wuxian realizes it doesn't matter. He has everything he wants already within his grasp, and he has no intention of ever letting go. \u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d he tells Lan Wangji. \u201cI don\u2019t care if everyone thinks I\u2019m a bad influence on you, if I\u2019m not good enough for you, if you\u2019re better off without me\u2014I\u2019m crazy about you,\u201d he says. \u201cYou made me crazy about you, you spoiled me so much I don\u2019t think I can live without you anymore. You tamed me so you have to take responsibility.\u201d\nLan Wangji takes Wei Wuxian\u2019s hand and bites gently on his finger. \u201cI\u2019ll take responsibility,\u201d he promises.\n\u201cYou better,\u201d Wei Wuxian says fiercely and pulls him in for a kiss.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nUncle Jiang leaves the next morning for official sect business. Madam Yu is in a worse mood than usual and gathers all the disciples for extra training \u201cwhile Jiang FengMian can\u2019t baby them,\u201d she claims. Wei Wuxian is the only one left alone since his job is to keep Lan Wangji company, which works out fine. He can escape Madam Yu\u2019s bad temper, and since she isn\u2019t riding Xuan-Xuan that day, Wei Wuxian spends the morning packing a lunch with Jiang Yanli\u2019s help, and takes Lan Wangji out on the back of the xuanwu for a cruise and picnic.\nThe xuanwu is now so large that both of them can sit comfortably on its back with their three-tiered lunch box. And as long as they remember to toss a longan in its mouth every once in awhile, it's happy to remain steady as it swims around the lake.\nWei Wuxian spends the afternoon basking in the warm spring sun with his head in Lan Wangji\u2019s lap, opening his mouth every once in awhile for Lan Wangji to drop a peeled longan in at the same time as he tosses one to the xuanwu.\n\u201cI like you, Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian tells him. \u201cI like you so much. I love you. You\u2019re the only one I ever want.\u201d\nWei Wuxian laughs when Lan Wangji leans down to kiss him until he can\u2019t breathe anymore. When Lan Wangji straightens up again, Wei Wuxian smiles, staring up at his\u00a0handsome face haloed by the afternoon sun, and wonders how he ever got so lucky. He reaches up to touch his face and Lan Wangji catches his hand, entwining their fingers.\nWei Wuxian kisses him again. \u201cI want to be with you forever,\u201d he says.\nThe xuanwu honks and Wei Wuxian laughs, reaching over to pat it on the head. \u201cYes, yes, we like you too, Xuan-Xuan,\u201d he says.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo much happens that winter that Wei Wuxian completely forgets the reason they ended up this way in the first place until a few days later, when\u00a0Wang LingJiao shows up with a group of QishanWen Sect cultivators, and demands Madam Yu discipline\u00a0him.\nLan Wangji makes a move to step in front of Wei Wuxian who shakes his head. It will only make the whole situation worse if Lan Wangji tries to defend him\u2014he can take a stroke or two from Zidian if it will appease Wang LingJiao and keep Lotus Pier safe.\nMadam Yu whips him until his vision goes spotty, but when she stops, Lan Wangji is there to catch him. Wei Wuxian hisses with pain, wanting nothing more than for Lan Wangji to take him away.\nWang LingJiao laughs. \u201cThis is wonderful! I didn\u2019t think the Violet Spider would be so cooperative, but since you are, I\u2019ve decided that Lotus Pier will have the great honor of becoming QishanWen Sect\u2019s Supervision Office after all,\u201d she says.\nMadam Yu\u2019s fury, previously centered on Wei Wuxian, comes down on Wang LingJiao. \u201cQishanWen\u2019s Supervision Office? Who do you think you are?\u201d she says.\nAlthough everything hurts so much Wei Wuxian is only staying conscious by sheer willpower, he feels almost as shocked as Wang LingJiao looks when Madam Yu slaps her so hard across one cheek that her neck snaps to the side. Then she grabs her by the hair and backhands her other cheek so hard she falls back.\nWang LingJiao begins screaming\u00a0for help, which is when Wei Wuxian realizes what\u2019s happening.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an ambush,\u201d Lan Wangji says, his voice low, but Wei Wuxian can tell from the intensity of it that he's\u00a0worried.\n\u201cStop her,\u201d Madam Yu orders as Wang LingJiao makes a break for the outside, still screaming as she runs. \u201cShe cannot leave Lotus Pier!\u201d\nBut as soon as the door opens, they can already tell it\u2019s too late. In the dim horizon, there are countless Wen Sect boats floating around Lotus Pier, readying for ambush.\nWen ZhuLiu flies down, heading straight for them.\n\u201cSave me!\u201d Wang LingJiao screams at him. \u201cHurry and save me!\u201d\n\u201cRaise the barriers!\u201d Madam Yu orders as cultivators scramble to obey orders. But magical barriers take time, and even as they\u2019re being erected, Wei Wuxian can tell they won\u2019t get them up in time.\nWen ZhuLiu has already passed the boundary and has his hand outstretched with his core-melting power sparking in his palm. If it hits anyone, their golden core will melt. At all costs, that hand has to stay away from Madam Yu.\nLan Wangji shoves Wei Wuxian behind him, Bichen already unsheathed.\nMadam Yu stands, Zidian sparking as she readies herself to meet Wen ZhuLiu.\nBut before Wen ZhuLiu can get to Madam Yu, a thick, long neck suddenly darts from the still lake water.\nThe xuanwu clamps its enormous jaws around Wen ZhuLiu\u2019s waist. The cultivator\u2019s surprised shout is cut off when it drags him under water.\nWang LingJiao is so shocked she stops screaming.\nBubbles rise up from the lotus pond, but a few minutes later, the xuanwu is the one that raises its head. Beneath it, Wen ZhuLiu\u2019s drowned body floats to the surface and bobs there silently.\nXuan-Xuan swims over to Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji and makes a pleased, clicking noise. It bends its neck so Wei Wuxian can give it a few pats on the nose. \u201cGood girl,\u201d he says faintly, still too shocked by the sudden turn of events.\nThe xuanwu makes another pleased click. It noses at Wei Wuxian\u2019s hand and then gives him a gentle bite on the arm.\nWei Wuxian sighs and looks over at Lan Wangji. \u201cIs this another armed alliance?\u201d he asks.\nLan Wangji raises an eyebrow.\nWang LingJiao is the first to recover. \u201cWei Wuxian has tamed a xuanwu!\u201d she screams.\n\u201cOf course he has,\u201d Madam Yu says. \u201cDon\u2019t you know our sect\u2019s motto? Attempt the impossible,\u201d she says and then points to her. \u201cXuan-Xuan, attack!\u201d she orders.\nWang LingJiao\u2019s eyes are so wide they\u2019re nearly entirely white as she stares up at the xuanwu. Then her eyes roll back in her head and she faints dead away.\nAfter that, it\u2019s total pandemonium.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe xuanwu takes enthusiastically to tossing QishanWen Sect cultivators up in the air before dragging them into the water several at a time. Madam Yu\u2019s Zidian sends cultivators flying. Jiang Cheng, Wei Wuxian, Lan Wangji, and all the other YunmengJiang disciples take to the battlefield.\nEven with the xuanwu, it\u2019s a tough fight because the QishanWen Sect has come prepared at least in terms of sheer numbers. But when Jiang FengMian and the rest of the YunmengJiang cultivators return a few hours later, it decisively turns the tides of battle. By the time the sun has risen, what few QishanWen Sect cultivators are left have fled, and Lotus Pier is littered with corpses.\n\u201cWhat a good girl you are, Xuan-Xuan, the best girl,\u201d Madam Yu praises the xuanwu nonstop. \u201cGive her as many longans as she can eat,\u201d she orders Wei Wuxian.\nUncle Jiang\u00a0has been standing a bit awkwardly to one side as he watches Madam Yu praise the xuanwu. \u201c\u2018San-Niang, how about encouraging the other disciples,\u201d he says after a moment.\nMadam Yu sweeps a glance over at the other YunmengJiang disciples. \u201cYou\u2019re not as soft as Jiang FengMian would have you be,\u201d she says, which is high praise coming from her. \u201cBut you,\u201d she says to Uncle Jiang. \u201cYou\u2019re late. If Xuan-Xuan hadn\u2019t been here, you might have come back to us all\u2014\u201d\nUncle Jiang\u00a0suddenly pulls her into a hug.\nJiang Cheng\u2019s mouth actually drops open in the most comical way.\nJiang Yanli, seeing her parents embrace, begins to tear up.\nWei Wuxian grabs Lan Wangji\u2019s sleeve, staring wide-eyed at the scene. None of them have ever seen such a blatant show of affection from either Jiang FengMian or Yu ZiYuan.\n\u201cW-W-What are you doing?\u201d Madam Yu stutters, her face going a splotchy red.\n\u201cThank god you\u2019re okay,\u201d Uncle Jiang\u00a0says.\n\u201cLet go,\u201d Madam Yu hisses. \u201cWe\u2019re in front of everyone!\u201d\nUncle Jiang\u00a0loosens up only enough to kiss her on the forehead which spreads her blush right down her neck. Then he pulls a hairpin out of his pocket and hands it to her.\n\u201cM-My hairpin?\u201d Madam Yu says, staring at it.\n\u201cI had it fixed,\u201d Uncle Jiang\u00a0says. \u201cDo you like it?\u201d\nMadam Yu holds it up to the light, and Wei Wuxian sees her\u00a0jade hairpin, now veined with shining gold. She bites her lip, but Uncle Jiang\u00a0waits expectantly for an answer. \u201cIt looks more beautiful than before,\u201d she says finally.\nUncle Jiang\u00a0smiles and hugs her again.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt takes awhile to clean up Lotus Pier. Wei Wuxian has to keep a strict eye on Xuan-Xuan to make sure it doesn\u2019t try to eat any of the bodies and turn into another Xuanwu of Slaughter, but Xuan-Xuan just seems content being fed as many longans as it can eat.\nAlthough the QishanWen Sect cultivators dispatched to YunmengJiang only makes up a small portion of their forces, YunmengJiang\u2019s reputation spreads far and wide as having a terrifying new watchdog.\nAfter this battle, they\u00a0also know that QishanWen will be preparing for war, and an attack won\u2019t come by surprise again.\nAnd that\u2019s when Lan Wangji decides to leave.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t leave,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, frowning, when Lan Wangji announces his decision after dinner that night.\n\u201cBe quiet, Wei Wuxian,\u201d Madam Yu says. \u201cLet him finish.\u201d\n\u201cNow that YunmengJiang has openly rebelled, QishanWen Sect will return,\u201d Lan Wangji says. \u201cI will return to Gusu and speak to the elders about a formal alliance against QishanWen.\u201d\nUncle Jiang\u00a0nods. \u201cQishanWen sect has already burned the Cloud Recesses and now ambushed\u00a0Lotus Pier. We looked to the side when they only attacked the smaller sects, but it\u2019s only a matter of time before they suppress all of the sects one by one,\u201d he says. \u201cUnless we make a stand.\u201d He turns to Lan Wangji. \u201cI give you my blessing,\u201d he says. \u201cSan-Niang,\u201d he says to Madam Yu. \u201cWe too must discuss battle plans. I will visit the QingheNie Sect tomorrow as well. I know Nie MingJue has long hated Wen RuoHan.\u201d\n\u201cVisit Koi Tower as well then,\u201d Madam Yu says. \u201cTell Jin GuangShan of our plans. If that idiot doesn\u2019t agree, I\u2019ll talk to Madam Jin.\u201d\nUncle Jiang\u00a0nods. \u201cWill you be all right here?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cOf course we will,\u201d Madam Yu says, but in a distinctly softer tone than usual. \u201cI have Xuan-Xuan here after all.\u201d\nUncle Jiang\u00a0smiles at her and they all know something has changed between them, because for the first time, Madam Yu\u00a0smiles back.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEven though he knows it\u2019s for a good reason, Wei Wuxian is not at all happy about Lan Wangji leaving. He\u2019ll be going by himself for maximum speed. Now that he\u2019s fully recovered, unless Wen RuoHan himself is coming after him, Lan Wangji should be able to protect himself against any cultivators who might try to attack him before he reaches the Cloud Recesses. But Wei Wuxian still worries, although he tries to keep it contained when he\u2019s lying with Lan Wangji in their bed that night.\n\u201cDo not worry.\u201d Lan Wangji is the one to bring it up in the end, taking Wei Wuxian\u2019s hand and pressing a kiss to his fingertips.\n\u201cOf course I\u2019m going to worry,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, snuggling closer with his head pillowed on Lan Wangji\u2019s shoulder, probably the last time he\u2019ll get to do this for awhile. \u201cEven if you get there safely, there will be plans for war. I might not see you again for a long time.\" He turns to bury his face in Lan Wangji\u2019s chest.\nLan Wangji lets go of his hand so Wei Wuxian immediately fists it into his shirt, and finds himself being tugged closer into the warm safety of his\u00a0arms. He feels Lan Wangji press a kiss to his hair and hold him tighter, and Wei Wuxian can\u2019t help the stray tear that leaks out of his eyes.\nLan Wangji\u2019s hands run down Wei Wuxian\u2019s back, soothing, which makes the tears worse. He knows Lan Wangji has to go back to his own sect. Wei Wuxian himself has his own responsibilities to YunmengJiang as the head disciple. It had only been the circumstances that kept them together for so long, and Wei Wuxian should be grateful they had this much time.\u00a0\n\u201cI love you,\u201d Lan Wangji says.\nWei Wuxian cries harder.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn the morning, Wei Wuxian is bleary-eyed and miserable when he walks Lan Wangji out to the edge of the docks.\n\u201cDid you bring everything?\u201d he asks. \u201cDo you have enough to eat?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll reach the Cloud Recesses by midnight,\u201d Lan Wangji says. \u201cI have the meals you packed me.\u201d\nThe xuanwu has followed them over, but it seems to understand and blinks soulfully at Lan Wangji.\n\u201cTake care of yourself,\u201d Lan Wangji says to Wei Wuxian, and then looks up at the xuanwu. \u201cTake care of him,\u201d he adds.\nThe xuanwu gives a mournful honk.\nWei Wuxian is reluctant to let go of his hand, but finally can\u2019t find any more excuses to hang on.\nHe watches as Lan Wangji steps up onto Bichen and in a flash, has disappeared into the sky. He watches until he can\u2019t see even the smallest silhouette anymore before he finally turns to go back inside.\nThe xuanwu continues to look at Wei Wuxian and nudges at him\u00a0with its head. Wei Wuxian pats it absently a few times, but even though the xuanwu swims slowly beside him, it doesn\u2019t really help the acute absence he feels with Lan Wangji gone.\nJiang Yanli makes him his favorite lotus rib soup for dinner. Jiang Cheng even puts one of the bigger pieces of meat on Wei Wuxian\u2019s plate, but it\u2019s a somber affair with both Jiang FengMian and Lan Wangji conspicuously missing.\nIn the end, it\u2019s Madam Yu who puts her chopsticks down with a clack and pins Wei Wuxian with a look.\n\u201cSome look you have as YunmengJiang\u2019s head disciple,\u201d she says.\nWei Wuxian glances up at her and then back down at his soup, stirring around the pieces of meat and lotus root.\n\u201cAbsolutely useless,\u201d Madam Yu says.\n\u201cA-Niang, don\u2019t be angry. it\u2019s only A-Xian\u2019s first day without Second Master Lan,\u201d Jiang Yanli says.\n\u201cWell, if he\u2019s going to be completely useless while Lan Wangji is gone, he may as well go with him,\u201d Madam Yu says.\nThe words don\u2019t sink in right away until Jiang Cheng elbows him in the gut.\n\u201cOw, what\u2019s that for?\u201d Wei Wuxian says.\n\u201cHurry and thank A-Niang,\u201d Jiang Yanli says. \u201cShe just gave you permission to go with Second Master Lan!\u201d\nWei Wuxian's\u00a0head whips up. \u201cShe did?\" he asks. \"You did?\u201d\n\u201cHow did we end up with such a stupid head disciple,\u201d Madam Yu says. \u201cI pity GusuLan when you cross the threshold.\u201d\nWei Wuxian leaps up. \u201cThank you, Madam Yu!\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll be back as soon as I can!\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare shame YunmengJiang,\u201d Madam Yu says. \u201cOr I won\u2019t be the one trying to talk Lan Qiren into accepting you.\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t! I promise I won\u2019t!\u201d Wei Wuxian says, beaming at her. \u201cTake care of Xuan-Xuan for me!\u201d he shouts and sprints out of the room.\n\u201cXuan-Xuan is more useful than you anyway,\u201d he hears Madam Yu say.\nWei Wuxian doesn\u2019t stop to pack anything. He just grabs Suibian, waves goodbye to the xuanwu, and flies out. He\u2019s never been so happy that Suibian had been forged for speed and agility, because flying as fast as he can, it takes him a few hours journey before he catches up to Lan Wangji just outside of Gusu.\n\u201cLan Zhan!\u201d he shouts as soon as he sees the familiar white-robed figure. Lan Wangji is flying more slowly on his sword a little distance ahead of him. \u201cLan Zhan, look at me! Lan Zhan, wait for me!\u201d he shouts.\nThe figure up ahead pauses, and Wei Wuxian speeds up. When Lan Wangji turns to look at him, Wei Wuxian takes a deep breath and throws himself into his arms.\nLan Wangji\u2019s eyes are wide and startled, but he catches Wei Wuxian anyway, Bichen wobbling up and down before he can steady them. Wei Wuxian beams at Lan Wangji, arms locked tight around his neck.\n\u201cWei Ying?\u201d Lan Wangji asks.\n\u201cI\u2019m here!\u201d Wei Wuxian beams at him and kisses him right there in midair.\nLan Wangji quickly flies them down to the ground before he\u2019s so distracted he loses control. It takes some time before Wei Wuxian is ready to pull back again, but continues to hug Lan Wangji, beaming up at him. \u201cI missed you so much, Lan Zhan,\u201d he says. \u201cEven though it was only one day.\u201d\n\u201cMm,\u201d Lan Wangji agrees, his hands tightening around Wei Wuxian\u2019s waist.\n\u201cMadam Yu gave me permission to come,\u201d Wei Wuxian\u00a0tells him. \u201cShe has Xuan-Xuan now anyway. Can you believe she likes the xuanwu more than me?\u201d he says. \u201cYou would never like Xuan-Xuan more than me, right? You prefer your Xian-Xian?\u201d\n\u201cAlways,\u201d Lan Wangji says.\nHe leans in to kiss Wei Wuxian, but Wei Wuxian leans back, dodging it and smiling. Instead, he holds Lan Wangji\u2019s hand up, lowers his head, and sinks his teeth into Lan Wangji\u2019s forearm.\nLan Wangji tenses up all over and hisses.\n\u201cDon\u2019t blame me. You said it yourself\u2014you prefer actions to words, right?\u201d Wei Wuxian says when he pulls back. He smiles at Lan Wangji\u2014the one he's tamed, and the one who's tamed him. \u201cThe oath of a lifetime.\u201d"
