    "text": "\u201cSo. Merlin.\u201d\nMerlin looks down at the delicious panini on his plate, back up at Arthur, back down at the panini, and realizes that he has been pulled into a clever trap. Arthur has his favor face on. Arthur\u2019s favor face never ends well for Merlin, possibly because he is completely unable to say no to it. \u201cI refuse to get arrested for you, it\u2019s almost Christmas.\u201d\n\u201cYes. Christmas. I have a bit of a favor to ask you about that, actually?\u201d\n\u201cArthur, no. I am not going to pretend to be Santa Claus and traumatize small children, I am not cutting you a Christmas tree, I am not decorating a Christmas tree, I am not buying presents for your terrifying sister or father or stepmother, I am not spilling eggnog on your date, I am\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI was wondering if you might come home with me.\u201d Merlin stops mid-rant and stares at him, and then down at his panini again, and back at Arthur. This is a panini of lies and pain. He can tell already.\n\u201cFor Christmas? I\u2019ve got an uncle and a mother and a sister waiting for me at home, in case you hadn\u2019t remembered, I\u2019m not going home with you just because you\u2019re a workaholic.\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s. My mum might be under the impression that we\u2019re a little bit married.\u201d\nMerlin stares at him and takes a bite of his panini. \u201cYour\u2014how can one be a little bit married?\u201d\n\u201cI said it was a small thing, just the paperwork, or she would have cried about not being invited. And obviously, not just my mum. The whole family. Thinks we\u2019re married.\u201d Arthur winces. \u201cSorry.\u201d\nThere is a huge, obvious flaw in whatever plan Arthur thinks he is enacting. \u201cArthur. In case it has escaped your notice, we are not actually married. A little bit or a lot. Neither of those things. No marriage at all.\u201d\nArthur gives him the charming smile and the favor face at the same time, Merlin is fucked. \u201cBut you could pretend, couldn\u2019t you? Just for a few days?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d says Merlin. It\u2019s at least a good negotiating point to start from. \u201cI have a family, I told you this already, and I am fairly sure that being a consultant for your company instead of an employee means you can\u2019t order me around, and also, we aren\u2019t even dating, why would you tell your family we\u2019re married? Wouldn\u2019t dating be the first logical step in your elaborate path of lies and weeping?\u201d\n\u201cThey might have thought we were dating for a year or two before that. So my mum started asking why she\u2019d never met you, and\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThis explains so much about your sister and how she acts with me,\u201d Merlin says in dawning horror. \u201cDo you mean to say that Morgana actually thinks we\u2019re properly married? Like, living together and things?\u201d\n\u201cOur anniversary is coming up in April.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not hearing this.\u201d\n\u201cLook, Dad\u2019s country seat is obscenely large, invite your family too. Our mums will get along, Gaius already knows my dad, and Freya and Morgana \u2026\u201d Arthur trails off. Merlin ponders exactly what sort of influence Morgana Lafayette is going to have on his sweet little sister and concludes that the world won\u2019t survive. \u201cPlease, Merlin, just a few days.\u201d\nThe panini is not going to fix this. No wonder Arthur offered to buy him dessert too. Merlin is going to get cheesecake. He may in fact get a whole cheesecake. \u201cSo, you know, just pointing out little hiccups in your plan: my family doesn\u2019t think we\u2019re married, or dating, which is sort of a problem.\u201d\n\u201cFreya will think it\u2019s funny, and your mum and your uncle are used to things being odd around you.\u201d\nMerlin windmills his arms and gets a dirty look from a nearby waitress, but nothing else will convey how completely stupid he thinks Arthur is being. \u201cWhat possessed you to tell any of them that we were dating in the first place?\u201d\nArthur turns red, and Merlin thinks about mouthing the next words along with him. \u201cMy mum. She wants us to be happy, and she means well, and she would get worried every time I showed up to a family event without a date, so I finally just blurted that actually I had someone, and I wasn\u2019t going to make a person up before my dad does background checks\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYour family is legitimately terrifying.\u201d\n\u201c\u2014so I sort of settled on you.\u201d\nMerlin gives him a helpless, pained look. Arthur usually thinks those are funny. Today he just sort of does the same in return. \u201cYou know all sorts of nice, eligible people, Arthur. There\u2019s Mithian\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMy cousin.\u201d\n\u201c\u2014and Elena\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAlso my cousin, albeit on the other side.\u201d\n\u201c\u2014and Vivian\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAre you joking?\u201d\n\u201c\u2014or hey, there are the other men! The ones who know what forks to use! Leon would be your fake husband, he\u2019s the marrying kind.\u201d\n\u201cLeon was dating Sophia at that point, though, Morgana would never have believed me. And anyway, now he\u2019s with Gwen, which is why Gwen isn\u2019t an option. And it\u2019s a done deal, I really can\u2019t change it at this point.\u201d\nMerlin makes another gesture that he hopes encompasses just how much he is not a suitable partner for Arthur Pendragon, a posh business mogul who doesn\u2019t bother using his hereditary title unless he\u2019s trying to flirt with Americans. He sometimes feels like he\u2019s going to get kicked out of the places Arthur drags him to after work, and he\u2019s not doing so badly for himself professionally either. \u201cYou are aware that this is mad, right?\u201d\nArthur shrugs, looking suitably abashed, or maybe just pretending to. \u201cMerlin, it\u2019s my mum, I can\u2019t just disappoint her. It\u2019s almost Christmas.\u201d\n\u201cIf she\u2019s anything like the rest of your family, she\u2019ll think it\u2019s funny.\u201d\nArthur looks like he may be seeing the justice in that, but then he shakes his head. \u201cLook, it\u2019s one holiday, I will owe you a hundred favors if that\u2019s what it takes, but we can put on a good Christmas, the family always does even if Nimueh and my dad fight like cats and dogs and Morgana serves dodgy cocktails. The cocktails make it more bearable, actually, especially since Morgause and Agravaine are coming for Christmas Eve dinner. Your family would be welcome, and mum wants to meet you so badly, and I can break it to her in the new year, but don\u2019t we deserve a good Christmas?\u201d\nMerlin is a terrible, terrible pushover where Arthur is concerned. Gwen always tells him this with great sympathy, and Gwaine with a complete lack of it. \u201cI\u2019m going to assume you already have a wedding ring,\u201d he says, and sighs when Arthur beams at him, all smug triumph now that he\u2019s assured of his victory.\n*\n\u201cSo I have an interesting idea for Christmas,\u201d Merlin says on the phone to Freya that night.\nFreya hums. \u201cThe kind of idea that you tell me first so I can be the one to convince Mum?\u201d Merlin lets his guilty silence speak for itself. \u201cWhat\u2019s this brilliant plan, then? A beach in the south of France? Donating our time to a charity in the city?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say brilliant, I said interesting.\u201d Merlin swallows. \u201cHow do you feel about spending Christmas at Pendragon Manor helping me pretend I\u2019m Arthur\u2019s husband?\u201d\nThere\u2019s a long, long pause that is presumably Freya waiting for the punchline. If only there were one. This may well go down in the history books as one of Merlin\u2019s worse life choices, perhaps second only to becoming friends with Arthur in the first place. \u201cI think I\u2019ll skip asking all the obvious questions,\u201d she finally says.\n\u201cI asked them all at a fairly high volume, but somehow I got myself talked into it anyway. But I said only if you all agree. I\u2019m spending my holiday with my family.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m coming if Mum and Uncle Gaius do, because this is going to be the funniest thing I\u2019ve ever seen, I\u2019m pretty sure.\u201d Freya snorts. \u201cI want to tell Uncle Gaius, I want to see his face.\u201d Merlin has been imagining that too, with more trepidation than amusement. \u201cReally, Merlin, his husband?\u201d\n\u201cWill you help me convince Mum?\u201d\n\u201cMum will be so happy she doesn\u2019t have to cook that she\u2019ll put up with your and Arthur\u2019s latest hare-brained scheme from sheer relief.\u201d Merlin thinks about objecting to that, but it\u2019s probably pretty fair. He\u2019s really glad he bought her an amazing Christmas present, she deserves it for this. \u201cBut his husband?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t ask me, ask Arthur, he\u2019s the one who sprung this on me.\u201d\n\u201cIs he buying you diamonds? He ought to buy you diamonds. And I think I shall ask him,\u201d says Freya, and then, horrifyingly, hangs up.\nEven more horrifyingly, Merlin gets a text fifteen minutes later from Arthur that says Freya and I agree that a princess cut diamond is clearly the only choice. She says she is calling your mum to get her opinion.\n*\nThe ride out to Pendragon Manor, somewhere in the posh countryside, is quiet for about the first fifteen minutes, before Arthur says \u201cSo, perhaps you should know exactly what I\u2019ve told them about all of this.\u201d\nMerlin groans and tips his head back and wonders why he didn\u2019t go home first so he could take an uncomfortable train ride with his mother and his uncle instead. Freya\u2019s coming right from uni, since she stayed a few extra days to spend time with some friends. \u201cYes, perhaps I should.\u201d\n\u201cWe started dating in June two and a half years ago now, you\u2019ve had bad luck with holiday scheduling. You moved in with me last August, since I live so close to where we both work. We got married in April through mutual agreement rather than either of us proposing.\u201d\nMerlin waits for more, but Arthur isn\u2019t forthcoming. \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d\nArthur blinks at him. \u201cIt didn\u2019t take much more inventing than that.\u201d\n\u201cMorgana has been to your flat\u2014your family has visited in the city\u2014since last August, where do they think I was?\u201d\n\u201cBusiness trips, out with friends.\u201d Arthur doesn\u2019t do shame except where his mother is concerned, so Merlin is very nervous when he starts looking uncomfortable. \u201cI might leave a few things around when they\u2019re in town that make them think two people live there.\u201d\n\u201cIt really never once occurred to you to tell me I was your fake boyfriend? Husband? Like, not once? This seriously explains so much about my relationship with your sister and the amount of innuendo.\u201d Arthur looks vaguely ill. Serves him right. \u201cThank God I haven\u2019t seen your father in years. Do we go on dates? Are we planning on kids or obnoxious purebred dogs or particularly hardy cacti?\u201d\nThat puts Arthur back on surer ground. More\u2019s the pity. \u201cWe do go on dates, otherwise the amount of stories I tell about you when we\u2019re out to dinner would be ridiculous.\u201d Merlin stops before he can ask any questions, startled. \u201cWe aren\u2019t ready to take care of anything yet, other than you periodically buying a houseplant and fretting over it until I kill it through neglect when you\u2019re on a trip. Maybe a cat someday, and you\u2019re fond of birds but I have a horror of waking up in the middle of the night to something croaking that it wants a cracker. We\u2019re not sure about kids, and don\u2019t let anyone bully you about that.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, they\u2019re likely to?\u201d Merlin asks, in sudden terror, and then his ears catch up with them (it\u2019s the wind resistance that makes them take so long, and God, he\u2019s around Arthur and Gwaine too much if he\u2019s making stupid jokes about his own ears at this point). \u201cThose are pretty much exactly the answers I would have given, wow. Though I didn\u2019t know that about you and birds, that\u2019s hilarious.\u201d\n\u201cShut up,\u201d says Arthur, and then rolls his eyes at whatever expression Merlin has on his face. \u201cOf course they\u2019re the answers you would have given. You steal covers in the summer but not in the winter because you\u2019re too busy being a limpet, you refuse to cook anything that once had a face even if you\u2019re fine eating those things, your sister wants to be a doctor like your Uncle Gaius, and I picked you as my spouse because I know you, Merlin. This wouldn\u2019t have worked with anyone else.\u201d\nMerlin, entirely wrong-footed, has no coherent answer for that. \u201cAnd what am I to say when they ask me about you?\u201d he finally manages.\n\u201cOh come on, Merlin, you know the answer to that.\u201d\nAnd he does. He knows Arthur talks in his sleep when he\u2019s particularly tired and that he can\u2019t get ready for work without terrible morning television going on in the background and all the frankly ridiculous complicated family history that\u2019s leading to them spending Christmas with his father, his mother, his mother\u2019s wife of ten years, his half-sister, and apparently at least one meal with his half-sister\u2019s half-sister and a creepy uncle of some sort. And it\u2019s not like he didn\u2019t know that he and Arthur pretty much live in each other\u2019s pockets sometimes, but it\u2019s another thing to have him laid out in front of him like this and put in the context of marriage. It\u2019s the kind of thing Merlin doesn\u2019t let himself think about because it sounds tempting in the worst sort of way, the sort of way that is going to end with him heartbroken in five years if he thinks about it too much, and hearing that Arthur\u2019s thought about it so much, told his family about it, makes him unsure if he wants to hit Arthur or do something really dangerous, like kiss him.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a box in my jacket pocket, I ought to have given it to you before we left,\u201d says Arthur when he\u2019s deemed that Merlin has had sufficient time to mull over a few things. \u201cGrab it out, will you?\u201d\nMerlin does, because it\u2019s not as though it\u2019s the most intimate he and Arthur have ever been. Grabbing what is quite clearly a ring box out of Arthur\u2019s jacket pocket doesn\u2019t compare to checking him for rashes or getting called to pick him up half-naked from a fling\u2019s house or any number of other things. It\u2019s a plain black box, and at Arthur\u2019s nod, Merlin opens it up: two rings, plain gold (Merlin is willing to bet real gold, even), one a little thicker than the other, both etched on the inside with\u2014\u201cReally, Arthur? TH White?\u201d\n\u201cYou like TH White. We bonded over TH White. \u2018Once and future\u2019 seemed romantic without being soppy. Put it on, Merlin, we\u2019re going to have to get used to it.\u201d Merlin takes his ring out, fumbling and refusing to have any ceremony whatsoever about sliding it on his ring finger, where it fits perfectly because Arthur is a deeply horrible human being. \u201cWith this ring, I thee wed,\u201d says Arthur once it\u2019s on. \u201cHand mine over, please.\u201d\nMerlin does, and it\u2019s weird, watching Arthur put the ring on, businesslike as he does the one he wears on his thumb, an heirloom from his mother. He feels like he should say something, like Arthur did, but he\u2019s sort of terrified it would come out overly earnest, so he stows the box in the glove box and looks out the window and tries not to fidget too much with the feeling of unfamiliar metal on his hand.\n*\nPendragon Manor is just as massive and posh as it is in pictures. Arthur told him proudly that they filmed a costume drama in it last year while his father was on a trip to Spain. Merlin can believe it. The driveway is long, and the shed that\u2019s been made into a garage is quite a walk from the house, leaving Merlin pink-cheeked with the cold by the time they make it to the massive doors and Arthur keys through them.\nMorgana greets them at the door, cheerfully tipsy and with a bottle of cider in hand for each of them. \u201cYou\u2019ll need these,\u201d she says, all serenity and smugness, and then inspects them. \u201cYou really ought to have brought your family with you all at once, to shield you,\u201d she tells Merlin, and disappears inside the house.\n\u201cWhy are you two the way you are?\u201d Merlin asks under his breath.\nArthur puts his arm around Merlin\u2019s shoulder to usher him inside. \u201cYears of upper-class repression, my mother leaving my father for my nanny, the revelation that Morgana is actually my father\u2019s daughter, take your pick.\u201d\nMerlin doesn\u2019t even have time to admit that that\u2019s probably fair before Arthur\u2019s parents descend on them. Uther is as terrifying as ever, possibly all the more terrifying for the fact that he\u2019s wearing a pin shaped like a wreath on the lapel of his business jacket. The other two Merlin hasn\u2019t met, just seen in pictures: Arthur always talks about Ygraine like she\u2019s an angel, and she sort of looks like one, blonde and stupidly gorgeous just like her son, throwing her arms around his neck right away. Nimueh, the stepmother, follows at a more sedate pace, winking at Merlin when she catches sight of him.\nThe reason for the wink becomes clear when Ygraine releases Arthur, turns to Merlin, and promptly looks as though she\u2019s going to burst into tears all over him. \u201cMerlin, it is so good to meet you at last, Arthur\u2019s been so selfish, keeping you all to himself. He\u2019s been telling me about you for years, I was so glad when he finally admitted you\u2019d been dating. Your family is coming?\u201d\n\u201cThey should get to the train station this afternoon.\u201d\n\u201cYou and I will go get them, how does that sound? We\u2019ll leave Arthur here, he had to drive the two of you up from London, how was the traffic, darling?\u201d\n\u201cIt was fine, Mum,\u201d says Arthur from where he\u2019s hugging his stepmother.\nMerlin finds himself wrapped up in a firm hug from Ygraine, followed by a kiss on the cheek. \u201cI\u2019m so glad to finally meet you. I\u2019ve wanted to for ages, but I could never find a time to visit London and you were always so busy with your family, I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t suggest they come stay with us before.\u201d She puts her arm through Merlin\u2019s. \u201cCome with me, I want to know you, there\u2019s a fire in the sitting room and some eggnog, and we\u2019ll have a bit of the non-alcoholic sort before we go pick your mother up. Do you think she\u2019ll mind awfully that I only bought her a scarf? It\u2019s so hard to buy things for people you don\u2019t know.\u201d\nMerlin blinks, a bit bewildered. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be fine, she isn\u2019t expecting anything.\u201d\n\u201cNonsense, and if she\u2019s at all like Arthur described, she\u2019ll have something for everyone here, so it\u2019s the least I could do to return the favor.\u201d\nMerlin gives Arthur a baffled look and Arthur gives him a smile that\u2019s equal parts apologetic and amused. Merlin definitely understands far better why Arthur would make up a husband to make his mother happy, all of a sudden. \u201cMum,\u201d Arthur says when Ygraine continues asking him questions he hasn\u2019t got time to answer and giving him periodic overcome looks, \u201cmaybe let Merlin breathe? And introduce himself to Nimueh? He hasn\u2019t seen Morgana or Father in a while either.\u201d\n\u201cOf course, Arthur.\u201d She backs off and looks between them, looking a little tearful.\nMerlin hastily searches for something, anything to say. \u201cThe manor is lovely.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it? I couldn\u2019t bear to leave, and it\u2019s so large that it hardly matters that Nimueh and I still live on the estate with Uther.\u201d Merlin is never, ever going to understand the Pendragons.\nMorgana is in the sitting room when they get there, and she widens her eyes at Merlin like she\u2019s saying I know, aren\u2019t they ridiculous, which she isn\u2019t allowed to do, because she\u2019s the one who answered the door and informed them they would need alcohol. \u201cMerlin, darling, it\u2019s been ages. Not since you married my brother, in fact!\u201d It occurs to Merlin that all of this explains the accusatory and confusing texts about being sneaky throughout the last few months.\n\u201cWell, you know, newlyweds. We were a bit busy.\u201d Arthur makes a choked noise, which serves him right.\nMorgana laughs, and so does Nimueh, which is mildly alarming. At least Ygraine and Uther both mostly just look disapproving. \u201cCome on, Merlin, you\u2019re going to need a cocktail or two before you can handle this lot,\u201d she says, and Merlin holds up the bottle of cider he hasn\u2019t even cracked yet. She rolls her eyes. \u201cReally, that\u2019s just getting started.\u201d\n*\nMum and Gaius\u2019s train is due to arrive twenty minutes before Freya\u2019s, and Merlin steals Arthur\u2019s car keys to go and pick them up, since Arthur is well on his way to drunk. He almost gets away, even, before Ygraine taps him on the shoulder, already wearing her coat. \u201cYou didn\u2019t think you could sneak away without me, did you?\u201d\nMerlin tries not to turn red and probably fails. \u201cUm, maybe a bit? Nothing against you, honestly, I just thought you might want some time with your son.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s thoughtful, Merlin, but you\u2019re my son-in-law and I hardly know you, so for now I\u2019m going to go with you. Arthur\u2019s car is big enough to hold the five of us without squeezing too much, including luggage.\u201d\nThere isn\u2019t much to say to that, so Merlin offers her his arm to the car after giving Arthur a helpless look (and getting a blown kiss in return because Arthur is an awful human being). Ygraine takes it, and to his surprise she doesn\u2019t chat at him much while they walk. His first impression was almost being bowled over with affection, but perhaps she\u2019s a bit quieter when she\u2019s not part of a crowd of mad Pendragons. He\u2019ll hope so.\n\u201cI imagine you must have been avoiding us, until now,\u201d Ygraine says when they\u2019re in the car, and Merlin almost chokes on his own tongue, because of course that\u2019s the conclusion she jumped to and he really has no way of countering it. \u201cBut I promise, I really do, that we\u2019re only awful in groups. Singly we aren\u2019t so bad.\u201d\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t bad at all,\u201d Merlin protests, and casts around for anything that doesn\u2019t sound horribly false. \u201cOverwhelming, maybe, but\u2014it was more that I was sort of worried you\u2019d hate me. I mean, not Morgana and Uther, I\u2019ve met them, and they\u2019re intimidating but Morgana seems to like me and Uther hasn\u2019t actively tried to ruin my life, but you, well. Arthur loves you, and what if you\u2019d hated me?\u201d\n\u201cOh, sweetheart, I couldn\u2019t possibly.\u201d She looks a little teary all of a sudden, and Merlin can deal with tears, he was raised by a single mother and has a little sister, but he doesn\u2019t want to make Arthur\u2019s mum cry, because Arthur will kill him. \u201cI heard about you long before Arthur finally got up the courage to ask you out, I\u2019ve wanted to meet you for ages and ages. You\u2019re good for him. Just the way he talks about you, Merlin, anyone who makes my son that happy has to be someone I\u2019ll like.\u201d\nMerlin swallows and doesn\u2019t fiddle with his wedding ring, because people who have been married for eight months probably don\u2019t fiddle with their wedding rings. Or maybe they do. He doesn\u2019t want to make it obvious how new it is, though. \u201cWell, I like you too. Arthur\u2019s always spoken highly of you.\u201d\nYgraine smiles at him and the rest of the ride to the train station is much more comfortable, which is a blessing since his mother\u2019s train is ten minutes late, and spending the extra ten minutes with someone who thinks he hates her wouldn\u2019t be terribly fun.\n*\nHis mum and Ygraine take to each other instantly, enough that his mum gives him a few disapproving looks in the midst of kissing him on the cheek and telling him he needs to feed himself once in a while in the city, probably for helping Arthur lie to his mother. Gaius greets Ygraine pleasantly, since they know each other, and then talks to Merlin about his latest research while the mothers chat and they all wait for Freya\u2019s train.\nFreya steps off her train and is immediately swept up into their mum\u2019s fussing, and then Ygraine\u2019s, and then Gaius\u2019s, and it takes Merlin an age before he can actually hug his own sister. \u201cHow are things so far?\u201d she asks, and he hopes his helpless shrug can be interpreted as him holding her tighter by Ygraine.\nThe whole situation is that much weirder with his family around, because they all know, of course, so his mum keeps looking disapproving and Uncle Gaius keeps doing the damn eyebrow thing, and Freya gives his not-wedding ring at least three alarmed looks while he loads luggage into the boot of Arthur\u2019s car. Merlin really needs to talk to the three of them without any of Arthur\u2019s family around at some point so he can thank them and apologize to them all at once. None of them really hold things against him, because they\u2019re amazing, but they\u2019re still all going to look at him, and Freya is going to laugh at him every time Arthur does anything husbandly.\nFreya and the mums end up sitting in the backseat, so Merlin keeps one ear on their conversation (something about tree decorating, which the Pendragons don\u2019t do until Christmas Eve morning, the day after tomorrow) and mostly talks to Gaius about work and other very innocuous things, though Gaius does say \u201cArthur\u2014you know, your husband\u201d in an unnecessarily judgey tone a few times.\nThe door is thrown open for them before they\u2019re even quite at it, and the entrance hall is full of Pendragons. Merlin feels a little sorry for his family, he couldn\u2019t very well warn them about Pendragons en masse while Ygraine was there. Morgana is instantly making grabby hands at Freya\u2019s coat and her earrings, barely giving Arthur the time to tell her hello, Nimueh and Uther vie for Gaius\u2019s attention, and Ygraine pretty much drags Merlin\u2019s mum towards the sitting room, promising her a good sit-down, and oh, does she want some tea, Ygraine can ring for some tea (because of course they have a cook-slash-housekeep to ring for, or possibly more, Merlin sometimes tunes Arthur out when he\u2019s talking like a posh person).\nMerlin finds himself standing next to Arthur, feeling a little shell-shocked all over again about Pendragons as a species. He can\u2019t exactly tell Arthur that Arthur owes him so many favors, but he does the next best thing and turns to him and says, as solemnly as he can, \u201cNext year we are spending Christmas in Siberia.\u201d\nArthur, much more sober than when Merlin saw him last, nods fervently. \u201cThat may in fact be the wisest plan.\u201d\n*\nMerlin has prepared himself for having to share a bed with Arthur as long as they\u2019re at the Manor. Husbands don\u2019t sleep in different beds, or on the couch, unless they\u2019re fighting, which they\u2019re not meant to be, and the floor is definitely not an option because the Manor, Morgana warned him over dinner, gets cold as fuck at night. So, Merlin has been preparing himself ever since Arthur talked him into this.\nArthur, to Merlin\u2019s surprise, is the one who freezes at the door to his childhood bedroom. It\u2019s closer to Ygraine and Nimueh\u2019s wing than to Uther\u2019s, with a big red-draped bed in the middle of it, and the bed looks comfortable after three of Morgana\u2019s dangerous cocktails, some not-so-subtle needling from his family, a thorough examination of his professional and financial future from other, and Arthur holding his hand for most of the evening after dessert. Merlin could use some sleep, which is why he isn\u2019t terribly impressed to be held up running into Arthur\u2019s back. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cNothing,\u201d says Arthur in a tone that patently means something. Their bags are already sitting at the foot of the bed, and Merlin is pretty sure Morgana said all the rooms have ensuites, he really does not want to deal with Arthur\u2019s attack of conscience right not. \u201cSorry, come in.\u201d\nMerlin does, and waits till the door shuts behind him to cross his arms. \u201cYou do not get to freak out about this.\u201d\n\u201cI am not \u2018freaking out,\u2019 Merlin, honestly.\u201d Arthur even does the air quotes, like that helps his case at all. \u201cWhat even makes you think I am?\u201d\n\u201cYou look like the bed is going to bite you. If you have bed-warming corgis or something, you really need to tell me. That\u2019s not the kind of thing you spring on a person. Like, oh, marriage.\u201d\n\u201cThere are no bed-warming corgis. Or greyhounds, or any other sort of dog. And I don\u2019t think the bed is going to bite me, Merlin, don\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d\nMerlin goes over to his bag and rummages around for his pajamas. Normally he doesn\u2019t wear more than boxers to bed unless it\u2019s really cold, but in deference to bed-sharing he\u2019s packed quite a lot more. He\u2019ll probably kick off the covers and confuse Arthur, but it\u2019s better than cuddling by accident. \u201cYou\u2019re allowed to be nervous, I guess.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m never nervous.\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d He finds them and makes a triumphant noise. \u201cI\u2019m going to change, back out in a minute. If you try to mention work to me tonight, I am going to stab you.\u201d\nArthur makes indignant noises that might be words when Merlin shuts the bathroom door behind him, but Merlin decides not to care. Instead, he changes as quick as he can, and Arthur was right, the air is a lot chillier than it is even in Merlin\u2019s flat, which he keeps cold. He cleans his teeth while he\u2019s at it, and by the time he comes out, feeling much more sober but miraculously no more nervous, Arthur is waiting by the door, already wearing his own pajamas. And his wedding ring. Merlin left his on the counter by the sink, and now he feels inexplicably guilty over it.\nMerlin gets into bed while Arthur is still in the bathroom, since he figures it will be easier on them if they don\u2019t have to get in at the same time. Arthur likes to be on whatever side is closer to the window (why does he know that? Merlin needs to stop knowing things like that), so Merlin takes the other, curling up under the duvet. It smells like laundry soap and some kind of winter-themed freshener, and it has him half-asleep already by the time Arthur comes out of the bathroom and then hesitates really obviously at the side of the bed. \u201cJust get in already,\u201d says Merlin when he can\u2019t stand it anymore, thumping the mattress on Arthur\u2019s side of the bed. \u201cThere will be uncomfortable cuddling and probably even more uncomfortable morning erections for a few days, but I\u2019m fairly sure our friendship has suffered worse. Like fake marriage, for instance.\u201d\n\u201cShut up,\u201d says Arthur, but he gets in bed. His feet are freezing, because Arthur has terrible circulation, and when his hand brushes Merlin\u2019s trying to get pillows arranged to his satisfaction, there\u2019s a cold shock of metal on it, and since Arthur always takes his thumb ring off at night, Merlin knows what it is.\nThere are a few minutes of silence when they\u2019re both settled, Merlin curled towards the wall and Arthur flat on his back, both of them knowing the other one isn\u2019t asleep. \u201cAt least the families get along,\u201d he offers when Arthur makes it quite clear he\u2019s never going to say anything.\n\u201cThat will be a great comfort at the fake divorce proceedings.\u201d\n\u201cOi, you don\u2019t get to be a dick about this, this was your idea.\u201d\n\u201cYou should have said no like a reasonable human being and sent me here in disgrace and shame or to continue the fa\u00e7ade!\u201d Arthur pauses, because even he has to realize how insane that sounds. \u201cLook, thank you. It\u2019s just weird, suddenly having my best mate be my husband.\u201d\nMerlin tries really hard not to turn pink and mostly finds himself grateful that the room is dark. \u201cYour best mate?\u201d\n\u201cShut up, I\u2019m not saying it again.\u201d Arthur makes a gloomy noise. \u201cMy mum loves you.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m charming.\u201d\n\u201cGod knows what the appeal is.\u201d\n\u201cYou could have picked a different fake husband.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019re stuck with me. No, but \u2026 thank you, Merlin, really. Somehow you\u2019ve managed to be quite a passable husband, my mother is charmed, my stepmother is amused, my sister liked you already, and my father is at least willing to deal with you. So thanks.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d says Merlin, and decides it\u2019s in his best interest to start pretending he\u2019s asleep before Arthur starts saying anything else stupid and lovely.\n*\nThe Pendragons are a late-sleeping breed, so Merlin manages to have breakfast with his family in the morning. All three of them are waiting in the kitchen when he gets there, like they\u2019re waiting to have an intervention, but none of them does anything more than gesture at the counter and the bounty of food laid out on it before going back to sipping at their morning tea.\n\u201cEnjoying it here?\u201d Merlin asks, because it\u2019s his fault they\u2019re here at all.\n\u201cMorgana says they\u2019re getting a twelve-foot tree,\u201d says Freya with all the wide-eyed wonder of a six-year-old. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to use ladders to decorate.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s lovely,\u201d his mother translates, smiling at Merlin as he sits down across from her at the table. \u201cYou\u2019re doing well?\u201d\n\u201cOh, you know, it\u2019s all a bit surreal.\u201d He taps his ring against his glass of orange juice, and all of them look at it. \u201cBut believe it or not, Arthur and I have been in worse scrapes.\u201d\nHis mother frowns. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine how Ygraine will react when Arthur tells her.\u201d\nMerlin looks around, automatically expecting a Pendragon to pounce. When none does, he lets himself relax a bit. \u201cI feel shit\u2014sorry, I feel bad about it too, Mum, but \u2026 I don\u2019t know, I just\u2014\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t say no to him,\u201d Freya says, which is blunter than Merlin would have put it but still true. \u201cI have to say I\u2019m a little miffed none of us got to come to the wedding, it would have been an excuse for a new dress.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re awful, everyone is awful.\u201d Merlin gives Gaius a silent appeal for support and gets only the eyebrow thing in return. Fine, then, he\u2019s awful too. \u201cThis is why I married into the Pendragons. They\u2019re mad, but they\u2019re nice to me.\u201d\nUther chooses this moment to turn up, give Merlin a loathing look that would be hilarious if it weren\u2019t so terrifying, make a little facial twitch that might be a smile for the other three, get his coffee, and stalk away. Merlin decides to stop talking about the Pendragons.\n*\nThe morning is quiet at Pendragon Manor, everyone wandering in and out of rooms reading and chatting, but after lunch Merlin finds himself dragged to the library to do work with Arthur, who does not believe in holidays even when he is making Merlin pretend to be his husband.\nGaius is with Uther, the mums (and stepmum) have congregated in Ygraine and Nimueh\u2019s sitting room to make sure everyone has the proper amount of gifts, and Freya and Morgana are both on the phone with friends, so Merlin lets himself relax. He and Arthur sit on the loveseat in the library swapping laptops back and forth while Arthur says what he wants and Merlin works on implementing ways to make it happen.\n\u201cFeeling any better about things today?\u201d Merlin asks after a while, when there\u2019s a lag in their work and Arthur for once doesn\u2019t seem inclined to start right up again.\n\u201cI was never feeling anything less than fully confident in my plans,\u201d Arthur blatantly lies. He doesn\u2019t even have the grace to look ashamed of himself. \u201cYou should really have more faith in me, Merlin.\u201d\n\u201cYou are impossible.\u201d\n\u201cExplains why you married me.\u201d Arthur nudges him with a shoulder, grinning, and Merlin rolls his eyes. \u201cCome on, you know it, I\u2019m a catch.\u201d Merlin elbows him away when he leans closer. \u201cJust say it, I\u2019m the best husband, couldn\u2019t have asked for better.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a prat and we\u2019re getting a divorce.\u201d\n\u201cCome on, Merlin, you can do better than that.\u201d Arthur leans in again until he practically has Merlin pinned against the back of the loveseat, and suddenly Merlin\u2019s tight jeans are doing him no favors. \u201cTell me what a good husband I am.\u201d\n\u201cTerribly behaved, no sense of romance at all.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll show you romance,\u201d says Arthur, who is still practically on top of Merlin, why is this happening to him, he will shortly have no blood in his brain at all.\nThere\u2019s the sound of pointed throat clearing from the library door. Both of them freeze, and after a second Arthur vacates Merlin\u2019s lap, leaving Merlin a view of Freya standing there, looking like she\u2019s not sure if she\u2019s more traumatized or amused. \u201cYou two are such idiots,\u201d she says, and comes in. Merlin makes a note to thank her for the rescue later.\n\u201cI take offense at that,\u201d Arthur says, settling back in with his laptop like none of it ever happened. \u201cAlso, why?\u201d\nFreya stares at them for a second before settling in an armchair nearby. \u201cThere are a lot of reasons. I\u2019m not going through them all. Morgana is on her way in here, she decided we should, and I quote, get started.\u201d\nMerlin ponders what might be holding Morgana up, and all the myriad and terrifying possibilities suggested by that statement. \u201cAny idea what we\u2019re supposed to get started on?\u201d\nFreya shakes her head, biting her lip. \u201cShe, ah, said that the day before Christmas Eve is game day, told me to come in here, and disappeared.\u201d She looks at Arthur. \u201cShould I be as worried as I think I should be?\u201d\nArthur sighs. \u201cProbably, yes.\u201d\n*\nMerlin should really not be surprised that the Pendragons\u2019 version of a game day is nothing less than all-out warfare. They\u2019re all viciously competitive, and Merlin\u2019s family gets dragged in too, for at least three board games, a round of charades that Freya and Morgana beat everyone else at, more party games, and then a round of sword fights with old wrapping paper tubes that Merlin\u2019s mum and Uncle Gaius beg out of.\nBy late evening, Merlin is exhausted, and Arthur and Morgana have taken to arguing over the chess board. Merlin sits by the fire with a glass of wine he\u2019s nursing more than drinking, and is surprised when he turns at a tap on his shoulder and finds Nimueh there instead of Freya or his mother. \u201cIt\u2019s always like this,\u201d Nimueh says with great sympathy. \u201cYou adapt.\u201d\n\u201cThey always beat each other with cardboard tubes?\u201d\nShe grimaces. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that was my fault. Arthur and Morgana went through a phase of fencing with sticks. I thought this would be safer.\u201d\nMerlin has a welt or two that says it isn\u2019t. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve heard anything less surprising about those two.\u201d\n\u201cYes, they\u2019ve always been like this. Pendragons.\u201d Nimueh shakes her head, like she hasn\u2019t been taking part in the madness with great enthusiasm. \u201cThe thing is, they\u2019re worth it.\u201d\nMerlin looks up at her, startled. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cBelieve me, I\u2019ve been where you are. You are looking at your choices and wondering exactly how this is going to work, and it\u2019s worse for you because your family is here.\u201d Nimueh takes a sip of her own drink and looks across the room at Ygraine, who smiles back over at her. Merlin can\u2019t even bring himself to say that Ygraine isn\u2019t technically a Pendragon, because she sort of is, apparently. \u201cThey\u2019re competitive and they squabble constantly and they will never admit how protective of each other they are, but they are worth the trouble.\u201d\nMerlin looks over at Arthur and catches him looking, somewhere between trepidation and fondness. \u201cI guess they are,\u201d he finds himself saying.\nNimueh laughs and clinks her glass against his. \u201cWelcome to the family, Merlin. I\u2019m glad to have some company.\u201d\n*\n\u201cWake up, it\u2019s Christmas Eve.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fairly certain we\u2019re only supposed to be woken at awful hours on Christmas,\u201d Merlin argues into his pillow, but judging by Arthur\u2019s warm laugh, it doesn\u2019t come out half as coherent as he would like. \u201cWhy are you awake before me?\u201d\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s Christmas Eve and we always decorate the tree Christmas Eve morning. Father and Nimueh will be dragging it home right now because Christmas trees and my mother being amazing are the only two things they\u2019ve ever agreed on, and that means we all have to be ready to go downstairs and applaud their choice and decorate it.\u201d\n\u201cOf course you have proper woods on your property for your family to go out the day before Christmas and bring back a massive tree, I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m surprised.\u201d Merlin forces himself into a sitting position and squints at a clock. Not quite six. He may kill Arthur. He\u2019s used to being the one with the upper hand in the mornings, this is going to throw their whole routine off. \u201cDoes the rest of my family know we\u2019re supposed to be up?\u201d\n\u201cProbably my mum told yours and your uncle, and someone will have told Freya, they all just assumed I would let you know because we\u2019re married.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t because \u2026?\u201d\n\u201cBecause this is more fun. Come on, get up, we do this in our pajamas because Father always made us get properly dressed on Christmas morning before we could open gifts. Christmas Eve is our Christmas, really.\u201d\nThat\u2019s what makes Merlin get up, albeit with a lot of grumbling and groaning and telling Arthur that forget everything else, Merlin is spending his favors on a million pairs of wool socks because his feet will never be warm again. There\u2019s a knock on the door while he\u2019s still struggling his way into a sweater, and Arthur opens the door to the improbable sight of Morgana wearing flannel pants with penguins on them, a yawning Freya in her wake. \u201cGood morning, you two. Hope I didn\u2019t interrupt your morning fuck,\u201d says Morgana, because Morgana is terrible.\n\u201cWe\u2019re dressed,\u201d says Merlin, and Freya makes a horrified face.\n\u201cIt\u2019s cold. I would never judge a little clothed frottage,\u201d says Morgana, to which everyone makes a horrified face, before lacing her arm through Merlin\u2019s and dragging him out, Arthur tripping along in their wake, muttering that his mother is going to be downstairs and really does not need the details of her son\u2019s sex life.\nThe four of them get down to the sitting room where the tree goes at the same time as Ygraine and Hunith, who are both carrying boxes of ornaments. Merlin takes the box from his mum, and Morgana takes the one from Ygraine, and the whole lot of them start sorting through what there is, fancy bulbs and antiques in there along with terrible primary school crafting efforts from Arthur and Morgana, neither of whom has an artistic bone in their body. Merlin\u2019s mum has a little box of some of their ornaments: the wooden dragon his dad whittled when they were kids, a craft project from Freya that looks more like an Elder God than a reindeer, a little embroidered sampler from their grandmother with a horrid cheesy rhyme on it. When Gaius arrives, coming from the direction of the kitchen with a tray of steaming hot cocoa, he has an ornament tucked in his pocket as well, and that\u2019s enough to make it feel a little more like Christmas at home.\nThey\u2019ve barely sorted through when Nimueh and Uther burst through the door, carrying a trussed-up and truly impressive tree between them, pink-cheeked with cold and exertion, dripping snow everywhere. Merlin helps Arthur hold the tree steady while Morgana and Nimueh argue about how it goes in the stand and Ygraine unhelpfully tells them it\u2019s crooked every three seconds and Uther even more unhelpfully tells them it\u2019s crooked in the opposite direction.\nIt should be unpleasant, but Arthur is laughing and looking like a little kid and Merlin\u2019s mum is taking pictures and there\u2019s cocoa with candy canes stuck in, and Merlin forgets about the wedding rings and the deadline on all this for a few minutes, lets himself pretend this is what Arthur\u2019s family thinks it is, and tells Arthur that clearly it\u2019s his fault the tree is listing to the left just to see him wrinkle his nose in mock offense.\n*\nBy ten in the morning, the tree is decorated, strung with lights and ornaments and a horror-movie angel (\u201cDon\u2019t blink,\u201d Freya whispers when it comes out of its wrappings, much to everyone else\u2019s amusement. Not that Merlin would dare look away from it for long) that Uther insists is a family heirloom and has Freya put up in a misguided gesture of kindness.\nAfter, they all lounge happily around the room, surveying their handiwork. Uther has a tablet out, doing work even on Christmas Eve, and Merlin\u2019s mum is doing knitting while Gaius and Ygraine talk about politics and Nimueh teaches Freya and Morgana some heinously complicated card game. Merlin finds himself sprawled across Arthur on the couch, halfway to drowsing, holding left hands, the metal clinking together. \u201cYou\u2019re very comfortable,\u201d Merlin informs him.\n\u201cOne of my finest traits.\u201d Arthur musses his hair. \u201cYou can take a nap, if you like.\u201d\n\u201cWhat and get awful things done to me by this lot? I know that trick.\u201d Merlin grins up at Arthur, who just rolls his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m fine, honestly, I don\u2019t particularly like napping, you know that.\u201d\n\u201cMm, but it\u2019s Christmas.\u201d\n\u201cEve.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever, as close as makes no difference. But if you don\u2019t want to nap, I won\u2019t make you. I just thought you could use your energy for Morgause and Agravaine later.\u201d Arthur grimaces, and Merlin tries not to laugh, because he\u2019s heard complaints about the two of them around holidays pretty much as long as he\u2019s known Arthur. \u201cI certainly could.\u201d\n\u201cThen you nap.\u201d\n\u201cAnd get awful things done to me by this lot?\u201d Arthur smiles down at him, and Merlin\u2019s heart hitches in his chest because oh, there\u2019s his good sense telling him this is a bad idea again.\n\u201cWe missed out on a good chance to put up mistletoe,\u201d says Freya across the room, and both of them start, and that means they got caught staring at each other, and Merlin really did not need that.\nHowever, before he needs to examine his very-well-repressed-till-recently-thanks feelings any further, he\u2019s neatly distracted by every last one of the Pendragon contingent freezing and looking mildly traumatized. \u201cWe don\u2019t do mistletoe,\u201d Ygraine finally says, in a tone clearly meant to be diplomatic.\n\u201cNot since the Incident of \u201902.\u201d Morgana sounds solemn, and Merlin can hear her implying the capital letter quite clearly.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure they kiss plenty on their own,\u201d says Nimueh, and the room moves on, with a bit more awkwardness from the Pendragons, and Merlin will really have to needle Arthur about that conversation later, because it sounds potentially amazing.\nAs it is, though, Arthur doesn\u2019t move away, so Merlin doesn\u2019t either. It\u2019s Christmas, and things were always going to go this way eventually. If he finally admits he\u2019s in love with his best friend to himself in the middle of pretending to be married to him, well, it\u2019s probably no stupider than letting himself fall for Arthur in the first place.\n*\nMorgause and Agravaine look about exactly as intimidating as Merlin had assumed they would. Morgause wears a lot of eyeliner and has a big bag of presents, and Agravaine wears a badly-fitting black suit and looks sort of like a poor man\u2019s Professor Snape and has an envelope filled with miscellaneous gift certificates. Morgause, Morgana, and Nimueh all adore one another, clearly, and Agravaine sort of hangs about them hopefully in a way that\u2019s creepy when Merlin stops to think about it for a few seconds.\nAs non-festive as the two of them are, they seem to bring Christmas with them. Everyone scatters to get their nice clothes on for Christmas Eve dinner, Merlin fumbling with a tie and ignoring Arthur\u2019s mockery of his sweater vest and also ignoring how truly devastating Arthur looks in a dark red blazer while they get ready in their room, not caring for once that they\u2019re stripping in front of each other because they want to get to the meal.\nThe fancy dining room is next to the sitting room with the tree in it, and they leave the door open so they can see while the housekeeper sets the dishes down on the table before being dragged to sit in an extra chair next to Uncle Gaius, who she flirts with the whole meal, much to everyone\u2019s amusement. The extra Pendragons only seem to add on to the madness, but by now Merlin\u2019s family has been fully indoctrinated, heaven help him, and the meal is boisterous and loud and full of arguments all round.\n\u201cSo, Merlin,\u201d Morgause says just when Merlin has started to think he\u2019d escaped her scrutiny, and Freya starts giggling into her drink because she\u2019s a traitor. \u201cArthur\u2019s spoken so highly of you, it\u2019s lovely to meet you at last.\u201d\n\u201cLovely to meet you as well,\u201d says Merlin, because he can\u2019t say Arthur spoke highly of her without lying through his teeth.\n\u201cI can\u2019t help but wonder why you haven\u2019t come to holidays before this, though. I mean, you\u2019ve been quite serious for quite some time, from what I understand.\u201d\nMerlin shrugs. \u201cIt just never worked out. Life gets in the way, you know?\u201d Arthur squeezes his hand under the table and Merlin tries not to look as startled about it as he feels. \u201cBut now we\u2019re married, it seemed silly not to just combine our gatherings.\u201d\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s been lovely so far,\u201d his mum says, because she\u2019s the best, smiling at Morgause. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking forward to meeting you, you must tell me all about being a private investigator, I read far too many crime novels and it probably isn\u2019t half so interesting.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised.\u201d She smirks at Merlin, though, and Merlin puts her profession together with the fact that she probably knows oh God. She doesn\u2019t say anything about it, though, so either she didn\u2019t care to check or she\u2019s waiting for a more dramatic time than Christmas Eve dinner to share the revelation. \u201cThough really,\u201d she adds, \u201cthere are quite a lot of cheating spouses and parents spying on their children.\u201d\nThe conversation moves on, but Merlin doesn\u2019t lose the sense of waiting for another shoe to drop the whole meal. Arthur keeps giving him worried looks and nudging him, and that only makes Merlin feel worse. He\u2019s lying to Arthur\u2019s family and it will be stupidly easy to disprove their story, and he likes these people. It\u2019s not as though he asked Arthur to start the whole thing (except maybe, maybe there\u2019s a little glimmer of something these last few days, the kind of thing that will make the eventual embarrassment and apologies worth it, but Merlin is really not getting his hopes up about that yet).\n\u201cMerlin and I will clear the plates,\u201d Arthur says when everyone\u2019s done eating and they\u2019re all groaning and looking at each other to see who the first challenger for dessert will be.\n\u201cDarling, you don\u2019t have to, or I\u2019ll help,\u201d says Ygraine.\nNimueh puts a hand on her arm and smirks at Arthur and Merlin. \u201cLet the newlyweds do it, Ygraine, you know how it is.\u201d\nMerlin is fairly sure he turns the approximate color of red cabbage at that, but he gathers up plates and lets Arthur take silverware and the two of them take them out to the kitchen, which has been abandoned by the housekeeper, who apparently has the next forty-eight hours off. Merlin is fairly sure they\u2019re going to starve to death by the time they leave on the twenty-seventh, unless his family takes over the cooking. Pendragons don\u2019t cook.\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Arthur asks once they\u2019re safely in the kitchen and out of earshot because, again, the Manor is stupidly large. \u201cYou went sort of green during dinner, I know Morgause and Agravaine can have that kind of effect on people, but I thought I would check in.\u201d\n\u201cJust my daily freakout,\u201d Merlin says, waving it off.\nArthur shakes his head. \u201cCome on, Merlin, don\u2019t you think I know you better than that by now?\u201d\n\u201cI forgot Morgause was a private investigator. Do you think she knows?\u201d\nArthur frowns. \u201cMaybe. She\u2019ll probably try to blackmail me. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time.\u201d Merlin is never going to understand this family, no matter how much time he has to do it in. Maybe he\u2019ll be like Ygraine and a little bit Nimueh and go native eventually, but it seems quite far-off at this point. \u201cIf it helps, I\u2019m planning on telling them in the new year. You can listen to me do it, if you like. This isn\u2019t fair to you.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re all great, and I like them, please don\u2019t make them hate me.\u201d\n\u201cBelieve me, it\u2019s me they\u2019ll be mad at, but we forgive each other. Mum will try to fix me up with someone in revenge and Morgana will laugh and Nimueh will pat me on the shoulder and give me chocolate, and it will have all blown over by Father\u2019s birthday party in March. Which is good, when they\u2019re mad at me while we play polo it never ends well.\u201d\nMerlin stares at him. He doesn\u2019t know why he\u2019s surprised polo is involved in Pendragon family gatherings. It seems exactly up their alley. \u201cShould I even\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to try something,\u201d Arthur says suddenly, like he\u2019s just deciding it. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t have mistletoe to make the decision for me, like in the movies, but I have to try, I can\u2019t not, you\u2019re wearing my damn wedding ring,\u201d and then Arthur is kissing him.\nArthur kisses exactly like Merlin expects, which is maybe weirder than if it were a complete surprise. Arthur is take-no-prisoners, expecting Merlin to either give in or shove him off, and he lets out a surprised and satisfied little hum when Merlin does neither and takes a second of surprise instead before he starts giving back as good as he gets. Arthur backs him up against a counter and Merlin lets him, but makes sure to keep his arms around Arthur\u2019s neck so he can\u2019t go anywhere. If Arthur is going to do this, Merlin is going to be right there with him. Arthur puts a hand on his face and it\u2019s his left, which means it\u2019s the hand with the wedding ring, and that\u2019s enough to make Merlin want to drag him back up to Arthur\u2019s room and the stupid tempting red bed and do everything they ought to have been since they arrived at the Manor.\nSomeone in the doorway clears their throat, and Merlin lets Arthur go, since he doesn\u2019t really have anywhere to back away two. They hold each other\u2019s eyes for a second before Merlin dares to turn to the door. It\u2019s Freya, which is probably more embarrassing than it would have been if it were one of the Pendragons. She\u2019s got her hands full with a mostly-empty platter of goose (because of course they have Christmas goose) and her eyebrows up so high Merlin vaguely worries they might take flight before he reminds himself that his blood is not in his brain and he should not verbalize that thought. \u201cI thought it would be safe. Apparently I was wrong,\u201d she says when it\u2019s quite clear Merlin and Arthur aren\u2019t going to be able to explain themselves.\n\u201cJust a bit,\u201d says Arthur. \u201cUm, could we \u2026?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind me,\u201d she says, hastily putting the platter down on the nearest counter and fleeing.\nThat leaves the two of them staring at each other. \u201cThat was fine,\u201d Arthur says, more a statement than a question.\n\u201cI agreed to pretend marry you. That\u2019s not really the kind of thing normal friends do,\u201d Merlin points out, just to see Arthur\u2019s grin. \u201cBut maybe we shouldn\u2019t talk about this right now?\u201d\nThat makes Arthur go all predatory, and oh, apparently that\u2019s going to make Merlin\u2019s knees weak now instead of making him laugh, good to know, he\u2019ll have to start clutching at desks like a Victorian maiden every time Arthur goes in for the kill at work. \u201cThere are definitely better things to discuss,\u201d says Arthur, and then his arms are around Merlin again.\nMerlin lets this kiss last for a few seconds (or a lot of seconds. It might stretch into two-minute territory, but that\u2019s because Merlin decides it\u2019s urgent to show Arthur everything he can do with his tongue so he\u2019ll be excited for later, which judging by the way Arthur grinds against him works) before he pushes Arthur away. \u201cI mean that we should actually talk about it in our room tonight, and that maybe we should go back to your family before your sister shows up and tells us not to desecrate the counters because you know she would.\u201d\nArthur makes a horrified face, but he reluctantly backs off. \u201cIn our room tonight, then. Time to go back to Morgause and Agravaine, heaven help us.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I mind as much now,\u201d says Merlin, almost embarrassed at his soppiness, but it makes Arthur smile, so it can\u2019t be too bad.\n*\nThey go to the room with the tree after they finally conquer dessert, where they exchange presents with Morgause and Agravaine\u2014they don\u2019t all do it, but those two have other places to be tomorrow, probably doing very shady things, so it\u2019s apparently tradition to do this part of things a day early. For these two, he just signed his name on Arthur\u2019s cards, and pretends not to be surprised about the high-quality whetstone (for Morgause, who apparently has a collection of fine knives) and the boring gloves (Agravaine, obviously, everything about him somehow manages to be both bland and creepy).\nAgravaine gives him a gift certificate to some new coffee chain that Merlin has heard everyone he knows complain about at some point. That\u2019s fair, considering he\u2019s never met Merlin and Merlin wasn\u2019t expecting a present from him.\nMorgause\u2019s package is addressed to both he and Arthur, and it contains cock rings. \u201cI\u2019ve had to share quarters with him a few times,\u201d she says in a confiding voice to Merlin while Morgana and Freya laugh hysterically, Merlin\u2019s mum turns pink, and Uther looks like he wants to sink into the floor. \u201cIf he\u2019s anything like that in bed, I thought you could use these.\u201d\n\u201cOh my God.\u201d Merlin looks over at Arthur, who\u2019s wearing the expression that says he\u2019s unsure whether he\u2019d rather hide his face in shame or throttle someone (a fairly common expression, for Arthur), and then he\u2019s laughing. It\u2019s half Pendragon-induced hysteria and half sheer relief that everything is turning out fine, and it lasts until Arthur puts his arm around Merlin\u2019s neck and kisses the laughter right out of Merlin\u2019s mouth until someone (Nimueh) lets out an inappropriate wolf-whistle.\n*\nIn their room that night, things are awkward for a few seconds. They\u2019ve seen Morgause and Agravaine off, they\u2019ve promised to be dressed and downstairs no later than eight thirty in the morning so they can eat breakfast and open gifts, and now they\u2019re alone for the first time since the kitchen, and Merlin doesn\u2019t know what to do with his hands. Or his mouth. Probably he should use it to talk, first, that\u2019s the responsible adult thing to do. \u201cYou\u2019re still going to have to tell your family we aren\u2019t actually married,\u201d Merlin finally blurts, which is definitely not a good way to start a responsible adult conversation.\nArthur just smiles and rolls his eyes. \u201cReally? I hadn\u2019t guessed. I thought I\u2019d just assume they never had to know and that in a year or two it wouldn\u2019t be a lie anyway.\u201d\n\u201cThat would work out great except then they would be confused if wedding pictures showed up a few years late and with my family in attendance.\u201d Merlin turns away and strips off his shirt so he can keep his smile to himself, and a second later he finds himself half-tackled by Arthur, staggering into the bedpost. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re stupidly amazing, I\u2019m so glad I picked you as my fake husband,\u201d Arthur says, and kisses him, pretty thoroughly. \u201cI almost didn\u2019t, you know,\u201d he adds when he pulls away.\nMerlin frowns, a bit offended. \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t want to get my hopes up.\u201d\nThis time, he blinks. \u201cArthur, you said you\u2019ve been using me as your anti-matchmaking beard for years, did you really\u2014\u201d\n\u201cShut up, we don\u2019t need to talk about anyone pining for anyone, there are much better conversations to have,\u201d Arthur says, and proves it by kissing him again and then pulling away. \u201cLike this one: are we having sex tonight?\u201d\n\u201cFor preference, yes.\u201d\n\u201cGood, that\u2019s great.\u201d Arthur barks out a laugh that sounds nearly as hysterical as Merlin\u2019s fit of giggles earlier. \u201cI didn\u2019t pack lube. Didn\u2019t want to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cGet your hopes up,\u201d Merlin finishes, and snorts. \u201cWe could always go down the hall, ask your sister for some, you know she travels with that kind of thing for emergencies.\u201d\nArthur looks horrified, and then like he\u2019s considering it, and then horrified again. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think my dignity can stand it, and so help me, Merlin, if you ask me what dignity I am going to put Morgause\u2019s present to good use.\u201d\nMerlin tilts his head and considers that proposition from all angles, and then decides to go back to kissing Arthur, tugging at his shirt until he gets it off and then going to work at the trousers. It\u2019s going to be cold, going to sleep naked, but he\u2019s fairly sure they\u2019re up to the task of keeping one another warm.\nFor right now, though, it\u2019s cold out from under the covers, and Merlin is glad to let Arthur steer him onto the bed, both of them struggling out of their clothes all pressed together and horizontal, before they make it under the covers and huddle together for a minute, breathless and inclined to laugh even if nothing\u2019s really been funny. \u201cTell me if I do anything you don\u2019t like,\u201d Merlin says eventually.\nArthur, to his surprise, doesn\u2019t scoff, just kisses him. \u201cI don\u2019t think you possibly could.\u201d\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to say the same to me?\u201d\n\u201cI know you will, you\u2019re never afraid to tell me when I\u2019m being a bastard.\u201d Arthur wraps a leg over him. \u201cSo what do you think we should try first?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe we should save the cock rings for after our first date,\u201d says Merlin, and kisses him, since that\u2019s always a good place to start. He doesn\u2019t particularly want to do anything that will require suffocating under the covers, and handjobs don\u2019t seem to quite cover the culmination of years of pining, and it takes him a while of kissing (it doesn\u2019t help that Arthur is distracting and seems to be very interested in the idea of pinching Merlin\u2019s nipples and kissing his neck) before he strikes on what feels like the right idea. That requires turning over, though, and Arthur does not seem to be in favor of that plan. \u201cCome on, I\u2019ve got an idea.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got no lube, in case you haven\u2019t recalled in your sex stupor.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019ll chafe a little, but we\u2019ll manage, I\u2019m sure.\u201d Merlin pauses. \u201cNot you fucking me, just \u2026 trust me, okay? I\u2019m good at this.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll make me jealous,\u201d Arthur says, but he says it in a low rumble right in Merlin\u2019s ear as Merlin finally manages to roll over, and Merlin decides he\u2019s well within his rights to ignore anything Arthur says in that tone of voice.\nArthur doesn\u2019t take long to get it, once Merlin\u2019s in position, both of them on their sides. He slides his cock between Merlin\u2019s thighs\u2014it\u2019s a little dry, but Arthur is already dripping precum so it won\u2019t be terrible\u2014and starts shifting his hips, oh-so-gently. Merlin doesn\u2019t particularly want him to be gentle. He reaches back, grabs Arthur\u2019s hip and pulls. Arthur goes gladly, breath coming in puffs against Merlin\u2019s ear, silent while Merlin babbles out stupid words he\u2019s choosing to forget.\nHe doesn\u2019t come, despite Arthur\u2019s cock jostling against his on almost every thrust, until Arthur reaches out and puts their left hands together, the rings clinking in a way they feel rather than hear, muffled by the covers. Merlin will never admit it, but that\u2019s what pushes him over the edge, making a mess on his stomach and the sheets that they\u2019re going to have to put in the laundry tomorrow. Arthur laughs, because Merlin doesn\u2019t need to admit things for Arthur to know they\u2019re true, but he squeezes Merlin\u2019s hand, and it only takes him a few more thrusts to follow.\nThey pant together, afterwards, until Merlin manages a look at the clock. It isn\u2019t quite midnight yet, but he says \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d anyway, just to listen to Arthur laugh.\n*\nYgraine greets them both with a kiss on the cheek in the morning. \u201cI was hoping you\u2019d get over feeling awkward about having sex at home,\u201d she says cheerfully, because Pendragons don\u2019t have boundaries, and Arthur just grins at her while Merlin\u2019s whole family looks happily scandalized.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to send Morgause a very nice thank you note,\u201d says Morgana, and Merlin buries his face in Arthur\u2019s shoulder and decides nothing\u2019s going to tempt him out, not even presents.\nAt least until Arthur pulls his face up and kisses him, but that\u2019s extenuating circumstances.\n\u201cPerhaps we ought to eat breakfast,\u201d Uncle Gaius says, taking pity on them. \u201cThere\u2019s quite a large stack of presents under the tree, and I\u2019m not getting any younger.\u201d\nThe Pendragons make a large and messy batch of French toast for all of them, getting their nice Christmas clothes covered in flour and egg and none of them caring. Merlin sits back and grins until Morgana tells him he doesn\u2019t get to sit out anymore, he\u2019s a Pendragon now, and he thinks about objecting, but, well. Arthur is beaming at him and his family is sitting at the kitchen table with their morning coffee in their hands and fond smiles on their faces, and Merlin gives up and joins the madness.\nIt\u2019s Christmas, after all.\n*\n\u201cI\u2019ll go down again the weekend after New Year\u2019s Eve,\u201d Arthur says when they\u2019re in his car again a few days later, moving directly on from the train station. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be there for that particular conversation.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need moral support?\u201d Merlin fidgets with his ring. He isn\u2019t quite sure when to take it off, since Arthur is still sporting his.\n\u201cNo, I got myself into this mess, I can get out of it as well. You\u2019ve been a good sport, but you do not need to deal with my family when they\u2019re angry.\u201d\nMerlin winces. \u201cHow bad will it be?\u201d\n\u201cFather and Morgana will be angry with both of us. Mum and Nimueh will mostly be angry at me.\u201d\n\u201cIf it\u2019s any help, my mum isn\u2019t too thrilled with me right now. Even when I told her it isn\u2019t faking anymore, except for the marriage bit. She will forgive us, though.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019ll all forgive us eventually.\u201d Arthur works his ring off while he drives and hands it over to Merlin. \u201cBox is still where it was on the way up, keep them safe, will you? They\u2019re part of the eventual plan to get our families to forgive us.\u201d\nMerlin looks at the inscription again, the once and future that suddenly seems less like a ridiculous reference and more like a promise, if one with an in-joke. \u201cI refuse to believe this has been some epic Machiavellian plot to get us together,\u201d he says preemptively.\n\u201cBelieve whatever you like,\u201d Arthur says. \u201cYou\u2019re never getting free now, though. Angry or not, my family will be beating down your door every major holiday and birthday from here on in.\u201d\nMerlin grins and finally works his ring off, placing it next to Arthur\u2019s in the box and then stowing it back in the glove box. It seems to be a good storage place for now, anyway. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it,\u201d he says, and holds hands with Arthur over the gearshift like teenagers the whole way back to London."
