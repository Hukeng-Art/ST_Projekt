    "text": "Idols are weird.\nYou look at someone, watch them, through screens of all sizes. You see them grow, watch them change in skill and size, talent and maturity. You study their movements, their eating habits. Scroll through their twitter, watch their interviews. You know them, you think, but do you really?\nIt\u2019s strange \u2013 to admire someone so much. To be blown away by their skill, their kindness. To lust after them, in every sense of the word.\nAnd then\u2026 to have them here- \nViktor\u2019s eyes are animalistic from across the rink. Scanning, watching. They\u2019re a consistent burn, and it makes Yuuri\u2019s skin run warm.\n\u201cYuuri, focus.\u201d Viktor says, in a tone that\u2019s all too distracting. \u201cAgain.\u201d\n\u201cO-Of course,\u201d Yuuri nods, and draws his hands back out behind him. The rink is silent today, but springs to life with the sound of his skates scraping against the ice.\nHe skates, sliding smooth \u2013 as smooth as he can \u2013 arms curling, rolling, fingers moving in patterns that Viktor has done countless times before.\nHe\u2019s there. He\u2019s there. Watching with those eyes. They watch his feet, his legs. Curl up Yuuri\u2019s body and wrap around his arms, his neck. Even as Yuuri skates, jumping, dipping down and back up \u2013 he can still feel the eyes. Like something tangible.\n\u201cGood, good.\u201d Viktor calls, from the side. He\u2019s leaning up against the wall, more relaxed then Yuuri will ever be.\nHe floats, like a raft on water. One day, Yuuri hopes to be like Viktor. Like a single petal in a pool.\n\u201cLighter,\u201d Viktor calls. Yuuri pauses, and turns. Viktor is smiling, eyes sparkly, as he lifts his hands high above his head, and shows Yuuri exactly what he means.\nAnd god, Viktor is beautiful. That\u2019s no recent development, but it\u2019s still true, now and forever.\nHe spins, and spins, so soft, so weightless. It makes Yuuri\u2019s tongue dry, makes his stomach twist with so many affections, old and new.\nYuuri stares, until he realizes that Viktor is waiting for something.\n\u201cAh!\u201d Yuuri sputters, \u201cS-Sorry, what?\u201d\nViktor laughs, smile so blinding, \u201cDo you think you can do that?\u201d\n\u201cYes!\u201d Yuuri nods, in a bow. \u201cOf course.\u201d\n\u201cI thought so.\u201d Viktor skates back to the wall, \u201cYou\u2019ve lost weight. Your quads are already so fluid~ It must be the work of my special diet.\u201d\nYuuri flushes at the compliment, eyes turning down to his skates. Yeah, the diet is pretty killer \u2013 especially with his mom constantly tempting him with such good food.\n\u201cAgain!\u201d Viktor calls, and Yuuri gets back to work, heart in his throat.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nViktor is a good coach. Strict, talented. He shows him in detail, shows him step by step. He\u2019s relentless and stubborn, and sharp like the crack of a whip \u2013 which admittedly, is what Yuuri needs.\nBut Viktor is kind. He gives praise like a waterfall, overflowing and loud and it makes Yuuri drown. \nEach Good, Again! Every Beautiful! Stunning- \nIt makes him shiver. Makes Yuuri\u2019s hands shake and his gut curl. The words rush down his spine, hot and fluid, and his lungs pathetically squeeze.\nHe\u2019s exhausted. Viktor is tougher than any coach he\u2019s known \u2013 but he\u2019s kind. Viktor buys him dinner, gives pats on the back. Is so positive and bright, that Yuuri feels sunburned, just from being so close.\nIt\u2019s bad.\nIt\u2019s really, really bad.\nViktor is helping him. Viktor Nikiforov, one of the most decorated ice skaters in the world, is using his free time to teach Yuuri how to get his head out of his ass.\nYuuri sits in the hotspring, hands running up and down his sore muscles. His legs ache, his feet hurt, but his chest hurts the most. He needs to put this behind him \u2013 look at Viktor as a coach, and less an idol. As a man, and not a \u2013 a crush. \nAgh, it sounds horrible, out loud like that.\nHe needs to get his shit together, dammit.\nTomorrow they\u2019ll practice all day, and Yuuri will probably die all over again.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYuuri is absolutely adorable.\nViktor leans his head in his hand, idly watching the way Yuuri nervously eats across from him. His home town is cute \u2013 his family even cuter. \u00a0\nBut Yuuri? Yuuri is just, indescribably charming.\nDoes Viktor legitimately care about Yuuri\u2019s well doing in the Grand Prix?\u00a0 Yes. But Viktor isn\u2019t a fool \u2013 Yuuri is probably made of milk and honey. His skin is soft, eyes softer, hair the softest. And he floats on the ice like something made to be there. He\u2019s bumbly, yes. A little overexcited, but the untapped talent buzzing beneath Yuuri\u2019s skin is unreal. \nWhen Viktor saw him skating his routine, step for step, line for line, with a body not even in pristine condition- Viktor flew out the next day. He had to see for himself.\nHe\u2019s cute at any weight, Viktor has decided. Gut or not, chubby cheeks or slim thighs, he\u2019s still so captivating. Yuuri takes criticism well. Listens to him, with a flush down his neck and a respectful bow.\nAnd Viktor would just like to reiterate, that he\u2019s no fool.\nHe\u2019s never really been one to spit out praise like an endless buffet. Viktor isn\u2019t mean by nature, no, but praise is something he thinks is earned.\nExcept, Viktor sees the way Yuuri flushes. Watches his eyes flutter shut and his body tremble.\nSo he politely takes a sip of his drink and nods, \u201cYou did a great job today, Yuuri,\u201d and takes utter delight in the way Yuuri flushes, trembles. Shakes out a thank you, and refuses to meet his eyes.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s been a long time coming.\nThey\u2019ve practiced relentlessly in Hasetsu\u00a0. Weeks, and months, but Viktor has been nothing but adamant about taking Yuuri to his hometown rink in Russia.\nToo many distractions here, Yuuri, Viktor had said, with a soft pat on the back. I\u2019ll show you a real rink~\nAnd Yuuri can\u2019t quite wrap his head around that, because if anything, this rink is much, much more distracting than the one back home. \u00a0It\u2019s full of people \u2013 professionals, really, slinking around the ice without a hitch in their breath.\n\u201cAren\u2019t you excited?\u201d Viktor smiles, in a way that still makes Yuuri\u2019s blood run warm.\n\u201cYes,\u201d he trembles.\n\u201cViktor!\u201d A female skater waves, \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you!\u201d\n\u201cAnd you,\u201d Viktor nods.\nThey talk about something, or whatever \u2013 Yuuri isn\u2019t sure. Instead he\u2019s more focused on his skates, trying to ignore the glare Yuri Plisetsky is throwing him. Of course he\u2019s here. Of course.\n\u201cI see you\u2019ve brought your new pupil,\u201d Yuuri overhears. \u201cIs that him?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Viktor beams. \u201cThis is Yuuri Katsuki.\u201d\nYuuri looks to them \u2013 feels his face flush, because the way Viktor says his name is just agh. It\u2019s filthy, and smooth. Clean and flirty altogether.\n\u201cHello,\u201d Yuuri nods.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t he fail the-\u201c\n\u201cShush~\u201d Viktor cuts off, turning to wrap an arm around Yuuri\u2019s shoulders, \u201cThat\u2019s none of your business.\u201d\nThe crowd of ice skaters murmur amongst themselves, but Yuuri focuses on keeping up with Viktor\u2019s fast pace, and trying to breathe like, you know, a normal human being.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWith the rink full of skaters, Yuuri really has to keep his head in the game. He strains to hear Viktor\u2019s voice, over the talking and the sounds of blades chipping ice.\nThis is good, Viktor tells him. Drown out the noise. Focus only on the ice. \nSo he does. Yuuri spins, jumps. Uses his regained strength to run the routine as best he can. He skates on one leg, extends the other, uses all his flexibility to dip low, and back up again.\n\u201cWow,\u201d an old man leans up against the wall, bumping elbows with Viktor. \u201cHe\u2019s not bad.\u201d\n\u201cNot bad?\u201d Viktor smiles, \u201cHe\u2019s brilliant.\u201d\nYuuri\u2019s heart stutters. The world drops beneath his feet, and his vision fogs-\n\u201cAh, fond of your student, are you?\u201d\n\u201cYuuri is undeniably stunning.\u201d\nThe words echo around his head, like screaming in a cave. His body runs so hot, pooling in his stomach and rushing between his legs.\nThe tip of his skate catches in the ice. Yuuri gasps, as his body twists, and his palms slap hard against the ice. It\u2019s loud, and the entire rink goes silent. Skaters pause, coaches stop shouting.\nYuuri lets out a sharp gasp, because the blood against the ice is his own. He scrambles to stand back up, but bites out a yelp as his ankle pulses in pain.\nHis face is burning. Viktor saw \u2013 they\u2019re all watching him- \nYuuri\u2019s eyes blur, and his chest twists and his heart stops and it\u2019s quiet, it\u2019s so quiet, Yuuri could cry. An embarrassment. What an embarrassment.\nBut there\u2019s the sound of skates \u00a0and quiet murmurs, before Viktor is kneeling in front of him.\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d He asks, blue eyes shot wide, silver hair a mess around his face. He looks concerned.\u00a0\n\u201cYes,\u201d Yuuri sniffs. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry-\u201c\n\u201cOh god, your elbow is a mess.\u201d Viktor reaches for his arm, warm hands smoothing up to the gash on his elbow. \u201cDid you twist your ankle?\u201d\n\u201cI- I think so-\u201c\nViktors face twists into something determined. Something solid. He says, \u201cHold on,\u201d and smooths his hands gently down Yuuri\u2019s shoulders, and around his sides.\n\u201cAh, wait!\u201d\nBut he\u2019s lifted up, weight off his bad foot, and into the arms of Viktor Nikiforov.\nEveryone is watching. Viktor has no shame.\nYuuri\u2019s face flushes from red, to maroon, and he kicks a little in his arms, \u201cWait! Wait, I can-\u201c\n\u201cStop struggling,\u201d Viktor laughs, as he skates to the edge of the rink without effort. Yuuri isn\u2019t light. How, how is he-\n\u201cDo you need a doctor?\u201d A man asks in Russian. Yuuri\u2019s grasp of Russian is very small.\n\u201cThat would be ideal, yes.\u201d\n\u201cCome, bring him here.\u201d\nYuuri\u2019s head swims and drowns, as Viktor keeps him in his arms like a sweet little damsel, and only sets him down once a doctor kneels at his feet.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYuuri doesn\u2019t say a thing, as his ankle is wrapped, and his elbow is cleaned. Viktor watches carefully, like a hawk, analyzing every drag of the doctor\u2019s fingers against his skin.\nThe doctor gives Yuuri\u2019s knee a pat, \u201cIt\u2019s not too bad, don\u2019t worry. Ice it for a few days, and you\u2019ll be as good as new.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, sir.\u201d\nViktor is staring at him. The doctor leaves, and Yuuri swallows around the cotton balls in his throat.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d Yuuri trails off. \u201cI\u2019m putting us behind schedule.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you apologizing for?\u201d Viktor smiles, and offers a hand, \u201cIt happens to the best of us.\u201d He murmurs something in Russian \u2013 Yuuri hears fault, and mine, but Yuuri isn\u2019t sure.\nShakily, he accepts Viktor\u2019s hand. His fingers are large and soft \u2013 they wrap around his own with such shamelessness, that Yuuri wonders if he can hear the way his heart beats.\n\u201cCome,\u201d Viktor prods him up, and slips an arm around his back, to support his weight. \u201cLet\u2019s go back to my place, yeah?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nViktor\u2019s house is beautiful, and Yuuri will never be quite used to it.\nThe guest bedroom is gorgeous \u2013 it\u2019s all so spacious. So pristine, and clean.\nThey eat dinner; Yuuri stays quiet through most of it. The dull pulse in his ankle is a constant reminder, a loud shouting that says look what you did, you fool. In front of Viktor, in front of his friends- \nViktor\u2019s idol chit chat is welcomed. He\u2019s so handsome, so friendly. So good at small talk, that Yuuri\u2019s chest squeezes impossibly hard.\nIt\u2019s this crush. This blind adoration. It\u2019s holding him back, making Yuuri weak.\nBut how does he let go?\nYuuri thanks him for dinner, limps off to the bedroom, and tries to steer clear of Viktor, for his own heart\u2019s sake.\nHe\u2019s icing his ankle when Viktor pops in. It\u2019s cute, the little knock, before the tuft of hair poofs in the doorway. His eyes are bright and sparkly, but his lower lip is pulled between his teeth with worry.\n\u201cMay I come in?\u201d\n\u201cOf course!\u201d Yuuri nods. He shifts a little on the bed, and Viktor politely comes in, and sits next to him.\n\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you really feel?\u201d\nYuuri laughs, \u201cIt hurts.\u201d\nViktor solemnly nods. He\u2019s dressed down, in nothing but a tank top and jeans, but he\u2019s still so stunning. The tank pulls around his muscles. The jeans are snug and low around his hipbones. It\u2019s horribly distracting, and the last thing Yuuri needs.\n\u201cMay I touch you?\u201d\nYuuri sputters, \u201cW-What?\u201d\n\u201cYour ankle?\u201d Viktor clarifies. \u201cI\u2019ve twisted mine before. I want to see if the swelling has gone down.\u201d\nOh. Ohh boy. Yuuri breathes in, and wades away the heart attack.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Yuuri clears his throat, \u201cYes. It\u2019s okay.\u201d\nViktor offers that half smile, before he leans down, and oh so gently, wraps his palm around the slender curve of Yuuri\u2019s ankle. Yuuri winces, and Viktor whispers an apology beneath his breath. His fingers are incredibly soft, pressing into the bone, feeling for any bad signs.\n\u201cAh, it\u2019s gone down a little.\u201d Viktor smiles, \u201cThat\u2019s good. Hopefully it\u2019s a quick recovery.\u201d\n\u201cI hope so,\u201d Yuuri sighs. His eyes feel heavy \u2013 actually, everything does. Still, he can\u2019t help the involuntary shiver that runs up his spine, just from the way Viktor\u2019s thumb brushes across his inner calf.\nYuuri bites his tongue. Internally curses, and trembles when Viktor\u2019s eyes turn his way. His hand leaves, and suddenly, Yuuri feels incredibly disgusting.\n\u201cS-Sorry-\u201c\n\u201cYuuri?\u201d Viktor questions, shifting a bit closer once again. \u201cMay I ask something?\u201d\nYuuri swallows, \u201cOf course.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you see me as?\u201d\nThe question is weighted. Like cement in your palm. Yuuri\u2019s breath falls short, his eyelashes tap his cheeks with each blink.\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n\u201cAn idol? A coach? A friend?\u201d Viktor tips his head, \u201cI just want to know.\u201d\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Yuuri looks to his hands. They\u2019re a little sore, from smacking the ice so hard, but it\u2019s not an unfamiliar feeling. Viktor is staring. Yuuri forces himself to meet his eye, \u201cViktor, I have\u2026the utmost amount of respect for you.\u201d\nViktor nods, but he doesn\u2019t look surprised.\nYuuri breathes a half laugh, \u201cI\u2026\u201d he swallows, \u201cI was incredibly obsessed with you, when I was younger. But, aha, I\u2019m pretty sure you already know that. As does everyone else.\u201d\nViktor\u2019s eyes pierce through him, \u201cAre you still?\u201d\n\nWhat? \n\nYuuri stares, and his tongue betrays him. He opens his mouth, closes it again.\n\nI am completely infatuated with you. \n\n\nYou are the most talented person I\u2019ve ever met. \n\n\nYou are absolutely gorgeous. \n\nNone of that he can say. Yuuri is forced to sit there, and say nothing.\u00a0 Viktor\u2019s upper lip twitches into a smile. He\u2019s suddenly close- he smells so good- \n\u201cTell me if you don\u2019t like this,\u201d Viktor says, and kisses him, right there and then.\nAnd um, Yuuri just kind of, blanks out. Loses it completely, is the better way of saying it, but honestly, Yuuri enters an entirely different plane of existence.\nViktor\u2019s lips are soft, and slowly moving. Gently opening, and pressing closed again, warm in the way that the most experienced kissers are.\nViktor is here. He\u2019s kissing Yuuri. He\u2019s kissing him. His coach, his idol, his friend? Maybe? The object of all his affections \u2013 the only one who\u2019s ever truly had a hold on his heart.\nViktor pulls back, and blue eyes stare into Yuuri\u2019s with the first hint of hesitation that Yuuri has ever seen in them. Viktor\u2019s lips are spit slick, just a little, and oh my god his cheeks are slightly red.\n\u201cYuuri?\u201d\nHe must look like a moron. Mouth open, eyes wide behind his chunky frames.\n\u201cW-W-\u201c\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Viktor tells him, \u201cThat was really unprofessional-\u201c\n\u201cI like you.\u201d Yuuri spits, because his brain is apparently off vacationing somewhere else. \u201cI like you.\u201d\nViktor\u2019s face lights up like the city downtown, mouth widening into a smile so beautiful, Yuuri almost panics.\n\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Viktor nods. \u201cBecause I absolutely adore you.\u201d\nAnd suddenly they\u2019re kissing again, but this time Yuuri has half the mind to participate. His kissing history isn\u2019t exactly a mile long, but his instincts are enough to help him keep up against Viktor\u2019s relentless kisses. They\u2019re firm \u2013 nothing like the soft, hesitant press of a woman \u2013 but that might be the best part.\nBecause Viktor is a man. Strong, not one ounce of bodyfat, musky and wide in stature. Completely, and utterly captivating.\nYuuri\u2019s brain is reeling, tripping over itself, setting ablaze with a hundred and one doubts \u2013 but it\u2019s washed away, down the drain, by the hand that comes up and rests against his neck.\nThe breath against his lips is grounding, as Viktor leans back far enough to exhale, \u201cYou are beautiful, Yuuri.\u201d\nThe world falls around him. Disappears beneath his feet. Yuuri doesn\u2019t mean to moan, because Christ, that\u2019s embarrassing, but he does. The words rush through him, make Yuuri shiver- he brings a hand to twist in Viktor\u2019s tank top, and gently yanks on the fabric, slotting their lips together once more.\nHim? Beautiful? Viktor has no idea.\nBut Viktor is smiling against his lips. Speaking into the kiss, mumbling things like gorgeous, talented, cute cute cute- \n\u201cAhh,\u201d Yuuri exhales, head tipping back far enough to breathe. It\u2019s too much, just the words, it\u2019s too much. \u201cYou, you-\u201c\n\u201cI figured it out.\u201d Viktor smiles, slowly bringing his mouth to kiss against Yuuri\u2019s cheek as he breathes. His lips drag down, across his jaw. Further, to the soft patch of skin beneath his ear. \u201cYou respond to praise incredibly well.\u201d\n\u201cAh!\u201d Yuuri jumps, as Viktor sucks on the curve of his neck. \u201cI-\u201c\n\u201cBut not just anyone.\u201d Viktor licks, \u201cYour mother, no. Your friends, no. Even praise from your childhood crush- you smile, but you don\u2019t-\u201c He nips on the skin, tugging back, and Yuuri jolts, \u201c-shiver, like this.\u201d\nYuuri\u2019s skin is flushed red, down his neck, and beneath the collar of his shirt.\nViktor leans up to meet his eye, grinning, \u201cCute!\u201d\nYuuri whines, and brings his palms up to cover his face. He can hear Viktor laughing, and it\u2019s musical, like church bells. Lax, and gentle, fingers come to wrap around his wrists, tugging Yuuri\u2019s palms away.\n\u201cPlease date me,\u201d Viktor smiles.\nYuuri\u2019s head smacks back against the headboard with a residing thump, and Viktor giggles more.\n\u201cI-Is that okay?\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to tell anyone, if you don\u2019t want.\u201d Viktor draws his wrists out, uncurling Yuuri\u2019s fingers, until they\u2019re holding hands. Goddammit, he\u2019s so warm. So gentle. Yuuri is having heart palpitations, for sure.\n\u201cIs this real?\u201d Yuuri chokes.\nViktor gives that smile, that smile \u2013 and they\u2019re kissing again, both hands warm between the other, the pain in his ankle long forgotten.\nHe\u2019s ravished, completely, utterly, taken again and again by Viktor\u2019s sly tongue. It\u2019s fast, rushed- but not too fast. Yuuri breathes him in \u2013 gains courage, and wraps a hand in his hair, taking utter delight in the way Viktor groans against his lips. His hair is so soft? It shouldn\u2019t be legal, the way the strands curl beneath his fingers, Viktor curling with them.\nA leg prods between his own. Yuuri yanks back with a panic, realizing that he\u2019s already half hard.\nBut Viktor is on his own agenda, head following Yuuri\u2019s movement, just to slip their lips together once more, hands softly yanking him down onto the bed, until he\u2019s more relaxed, and breathing normally again.\nBut that knee- it drives up into his crotch, right against his sweatpants, and Yuuri all but yelps.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d Yuuri squeals, wiggling up on the bed, face horribly red. \u201cAh, I-\u201c\nBut Viktor is understanding. He leans back far enough to ask, \u201cIs this okay?\u201d\nOf course, it\u2019s okay. Yuuri has envisioned this hundreds of times, in the shower, beneath his sheets- that\u2019s the worst part, really. These sweatpants are incredibly unforgiving, and the tent he\u2019s ptitching doesn\u2019t leave much to the imagination.\n\u201cPlease\u2026let me have you,\u201d Viktor kisses against his ear, breath making Yuuri involuntarily moan. \u201cI won\u2019t do anything you don\u2019t like, I promise.\u201d\nYuuri\u2019s eyes fall down to Viktor\u2019s jeans where- oh dear lord, he\u2019s hard too. Okay, okay. Don\u2019t panic- is his mouth watering? Bloody hell, Yuuri is so disgusting \u2013\n\u201cPlease,\u201d Yuuri all but chokes, and Viktor springs to life.\nHands, hands, they\u2019re everywhere and nowhere at once. Running up his sides, down his arms. Viktor worms his way between Yuuri\u2019s legs, knees beneath Yuuri\u2019s thighs. He\u2019s especially careful of Yuuri\u2019s ankle, long fingers trailing up and down his legs, leaving sparks in their wake.\n\u201cYou,\u201d Viktor breathes, \u201cdrive me insane.\u201d He hikes up Yuuri\u2019s shirt, all growing muscle free for Viktor to ogle. He leans down, back bowing, just so Viktor can nuzzle into his bellybutton and nip up his sides.\n\u201cAhh,\u201d Yuuri squirms. Hot, it\u2019s hot. His underwear is too tight, he\u2019s too hard- \n\u201cI love watching you move,\u201d Viktor mouths up his sternum. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely captivating.\u201d\nYuuri\u2019s screws his eyes shut, and his cock visibly jumps against the elastic of his sweatpants. Viktor pauses, and Yuuri holds his breath \u2013 until there\u2019s a shaky exhale, and a laugh.\n\u201cIncredible,\u201d Viktor praises, and leans down to nose against his erection\nYuuri gasps, the pressure teasing, hips lifting up against his will.\u00a0\n\u201cCould you come like this?\u201d Viktor asks, eyes turning up to him, pupils blown with arousal.\n\u201cAhh,\u201d Yuuri squirms, body heating. \u201cU-Um, I-\u201c\nYes. The answer is, embarrassingly enough, yes. Goddammit, he\u2019s already close.\nViktor looks like he\u2019s having the time of his life. His mouth is pulled into that smirk, blue eyes chillier than any ice Yuuri has skated on. He noses back into Yuuri\u2019s crotch, mouthing against the fabric, and dampening it with his tongue. His hands slide up his thighs, parting his legs a little more, spreading Yuuri into something lewd.\nIt\u2019s all new, to be lavished like this. He\u2019s been with girls before \u2013 one or two, that thought Yuuri was talented enough to be worth their time. It was frenzied, and sloppy, uncoordinated and a hot mess.\nBut this is Viktor, who looks at everything as some sort of challenge \u2013 Viktor, who\u2019s taking his time, rolling his tongue against Yuuri\u2019s cock through his sweats, squeezing his thighs, watching his eyes. Viktor presses hard; Yuuri arches his back, and groans. His ankle pulses dully.\nViktor hums, sitting back up, rolling his hands to feel up the curves of Yuuri\u2019s sides, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Yuuri.\u201d\n\u201cH-Hah?\u201d Yuuri trembles.\n\u201cIt was my fault,\u201d Viktor says. \u201cThat you fell. I knew you could hear me.\u201d\nYuuri feels grounded, suddenly. Pulled down from the clouds.\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Yuuri blinks. \u201cSo um\u2026the p-praise was just\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo no no,\u201d Viktor tugs him close, sitting up his knees, giving one final yank until Yuuri\u2019s ass is pressing against his crotch. Shit, he\u2019s just as hard as Yuuri is. Viktor\u2019s voice sounds deep, deeper than usual, \u201cIt was all genuine, I promise. I just, shouldn't have teased you while practicing such a dangerous routine.\u201d\nYuuri swallows. He shakily rolls his hips against Viktor\u2019s crotch, and manages to say, \u201cThat\u2019s okay. It\u2019s my fault for being weird anyways.\u201d\n\u201cYou are strange, in the best of ways,\u201d Viktor tells him, hands still moving in still steady circles \u2013 and suddenly, Yuuri is hit with this overwhelming urge to touch him. To curl his hands up all the muscle Viktor has, and bury himself in it. It\u2019s probably the blind arousal, but Yuuri will take all the courage he can get.\n\u201cMake it up to me.\u201d Yuuri finally says, making no sense.\n\u201cHm?\u201d\n\u201cMy ankle,\u201d Yuuri stares. Slowly, he brings his hand down to play with the hem of Viktor\u2019s tank top, fingers barely reaching his hip. Yuuri draws his hand up, the tank pooling around his wrist, and dragging upward.\nViktor\u2019s eyes flicker over with mischief, hair falling in his face. He lifts his arms up, tugging off his shirt, before falling atop him once more, and kissing Yuuri like he was born to.\nYuuri gasps around his tongue, digs his good foot into the bed, and uses it as leverage, rolling his hips up against Viktor\u2019s. The friction is euphoric, really. Water in a desert.\nTheir lips move faster, a back and forth, a wide open press that feels filthy and good all the same. The tongue against his own makes Yuuri's gut curl. Makes heat settle in his navel, and his cock twitch against Viktor\u2019s hip.\nWhich is really becoming a problem. Yuuri wants to see- wants to feel how hard Viktor is. Slowly, he brings a hand to rub against Viktor\u2019s crotch, sizing him up and marveling when the bulge just keeps going.\n\u201cAh,\u201d Viktor breathes, hips rolling into his hand. Yuuri presses harder, and Viktor hums against his lips.\n\u201cOff please,\u201d Yuuri chokes. His voice is raw from the tongue previously down his throat.\nViktor chuckles, \u201cYou first,\u201d and in an impressive coordinative movement, he grips Yuuri by the thighs forcing his knees to his chest, and yanking off his sweats in one go. Yuuri yelps, watching as his underwear gets thrown to the floor as well. The movement jostles his ankle, Yuuri biting his tongue in pain \u2013 in which Viktor whispers sorry, sorry sorry- \nAnd reality crashes down hard, with the sudden cool breeze that brushes across his exposed skin from the fan above. His shirt is still hiked up to his collarbone, but his cock is shamefully full, flushed and twitching against his hip.\nViktor is looking at him, hands lazily rolling circles on his outer thighs.\n\u201cAh,\u201d Yuuri flushes, and brings a hand down to cover his crotch. \u201cDon\u2019t stare.\u201d\nViktor laughs, and tugs his hand away, \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s weird?\u201d\n\u201cNot in the slightest,\u201d Viktor says, and reaches down to squeeze his ass, making Yuuri pathetically keen.\n\u201cPlease,\u201d Yuuri exhales. \u201cPlease.\u201d \nAnd something in Viktor flips, pupils blowing wide, eyes going horribly dark. They scan him, watching Yuuri squirm and beg as his cock throbs dully.\nViktor undoes his own zipper in one easy movement, shoving his pants just beneath his ass, crawling up on his knees and slotting their hips together like they were made to fit. \u00a0\nAnd ahhh, the friction is killer. Yuuri makes a noise low in his throat, eyes closing, head tipping back as Viktor rocks their bodies together once, twice, so so good-\nYuuri forces his eyes open \u2013 looks down to Viktor, and scans across the V that extends down his hips. He\u2019s seen him naked before; god, Yuuri hasn\u2019t forgotten. That image was burned in Yuuri\u2019s brain, branded there forever.\n\u201cI never got an answer,\u201d Viktor exhales. His face looks strained, like he\u2019s trying to hold back.\n\u201cF-For ahhn, for what?\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019d date me.\u201d\nHis voice is raspy and dark. He noses up into Yuuri\u2019s shoulders, and rolls his hips, cocks slipping together, utterly perfect. Each thrust steals his breath. Every roll makes Yuuri\u2019s back arch, and his thighs burn, driving him closer.\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d Yuuri exhales. \u201cYes, please. Ah, harder-\u201c\nViktor thrusts harder, the tips aligning perfectly, both of them exhaling in shaky moans.\nViktor speaks against his throat, \u201cI\u2019d love to fuck you, Yuuri.\u201d The arm braced by Yuuri\u2019s head shakes, \u201cI\u2019ve thought about it so many times-\u201c\n\u201cFuck,\u201d Yuuri curses. \u201cPlease, please-\u201c\n\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d Viktor nips. \u201cI won\u2019t even last a minute. You\u2019re too sexy, Yuuri~\u201d\n\u201cAhhh!\u201d Yuuri arches, body flushing stupidly hot. His cock jumps against Viktor\u2019s, his balls raise \u2013 he\u2019s close, he\u2019s close, he\u2019s close-\nViktor is evil, mouthing against his ear. Breathing wet and heavily, just to give Yuuri goosebumps. \u201cLook what you\u2019ve done to me.\u201d\nYuuri does \u2013 Viktor\u2019s cock is heavy, leaking too \u2013 falling against Yuuri\u2019s and god does it look lewd.\n\u201cI\u2019m close!\u201d Yuuri blurts, arching, heaving-\nViktor leans up to kiss him, stealing his tongue, his spit, his soul, his heart, begging, \u201cPlease, Yuuri. Give yourself to me.\u201d\nAnd he does, in a hard wash of light and heat. His gut makes that final twist, toes tingling, eyelids fluttering shut as his mouth drops open in a wordless moan. His cock lifts off his stomach, coming hard and fast, making a real mess.\nYuuri repeats his name, hardly kissing back. He grips Viktor\u2019s hair and pulls, wrenching a hard moan out of Viktor. As the aftershocks wash through, Yuuri tugs again, watching as Viktor\u2019s eyes roll shut, body beautifully slick with sweat.\n\u201cViktor, Viktor,\u201d Yuuri pants. He smooths a hand around his shoulder, down his chest, \u201cViktor-\u201c \nAnd he comes, with a final thrust against his hip, body going rigid and hard, mumbling words Yuuri doesn\u2019t understand.\nIt\u2019s beautiful. A sight Yuuri thought he\u2019d never see.\nSlowly, they cool.\nYuuri\u2019s chest is a sticky mess. He\u2019s flushed, all the way down his collar and around his thighs \u2013 Viktor, in his boneless state, still has the polite mind to roll off, reaching for the bedside table and wiping Yuuri clean with a handful of tissues.\n\u00a0They\u2019re tossed to the side, before Viktor rolls next to him, and exhales hard into the pillows.\nYuuri is still shocked silent. He\u2019s staring at the ceiling tiles, eyes wide, breathing labored. He\u2019s never come that hard in his life. The endorphins are so good, his ankle doesn\u2019t even hurt.\nViktor turns his head to the side, eyes bearing into Yuuri\u2019s cheek.\u00a0Cutely enough, he asks, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\nAnd Yuuri just kind of\u2026cracks.\nBecause really, was all that real? Did that actually just happen?\nIt starts as one giggle. Then two, then ten, until Yuuri is smothering his laughs into his hand, sides aching, half naked body curling up into the sheets.\nViktor\u2019s face makes Yuuri laugh harder. He looks shocked, hair tousled from Yuuri\u2019s hands, eyes blown out from his orgasm. But as Yuuri laughs, Viktor squeezes closer, arms wrapping around Yuuri\u2019s side, nuzzling into his neck, \u201cWhat? What is it?\u201d\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Yuuri manages. \u201cThis is a dream, right?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know~\u201d Viktor coos, rolling half on top of him, tickling Yuuri\u2019s face with his nose, \u201cIs it?\u201d\nYuuri laughs so hard, he snorts. He covers his mouth with his hand, and Viktor leans back to meet his eye. The elder grins, so genuinely happy, \u201cYour laugh is adorable.\u201d\nYuuri feels his face flush. He looks to the floor, where his pants are wadded up in a ball \u2013 but Viktor demands his eye contact, by pressing close, softly kissing him once, twice, until all the tension in Yuuri\u2019s shoulders have bled off the mattress, and onto the floor.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWonderful!\u201d Viktor praises, hands clasped behind his back. \u201cHigher, Yuuri.\u201d\nHe goes higher.\n\u201cSofter.\u201d\nHe turns softer.\n\u201cPut your heart into it, Yuuri!\u201d\nSo Yuuri does, skates grinding against the ice, body moving fluid and effortless, fueled by each demand Viktor gives. Yuuri has the attention of the entire rink, everyone watching as he flips, moves, curls his fingers and bends back, testing every ounce of flexibility he has.\nHe\u2019s getting stronger. Yuuri feels it, every day.\n\u201cAbsolutely stunning,\u201d Viktor tells him, as Yuuri completes his routine with ragged breath. The compliment warms his muscles, and makes him smile.\n\u201cThank you, coach.\u201d Yuuri teases.\nThe look in Viktor\u2019s eye is predatorily sharp. He gives a nod, gesturing for Yuuri to skate his way. The room is still watching him \u2013 so Viktor settles for a friendly tap on the shoulder, before sliding his hand down Yuuri\u2019s arm in a movement fluid enough to give Yuuri goosebumps.\n\u201cWill you let me buy you dinner tonight?\u201d Viktor asks, with such a dark underlying tone.\nBut Yuuri flirts back, turning on his heel, ice chipping, \u201cIt depends on where we go~\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0"
