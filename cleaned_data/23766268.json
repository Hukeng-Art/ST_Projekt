    "text": "It starts with a comment.\nActually, more like with a BANG. And yelling. And Bakugou going DIE DIE DIE because some poor soul probably dared to say hi to him or something.\nThe comment is this:\n\u201cBakugou doesn\u2019t like anybody, does he?\u201d Tsuyu asks.\n\u201cThat\u2026would be putting it lightly,\u201d Izuku replies.\nShe comes to a stop beside him, regarding the scene before them with a frank curiosity. Coming down the school steps are Uraraka and Tokoyami. They pause at the commotion, joining him and Tsuyu in spectating.\n\u201cWe should probably stop him,\u201d Uraraka says, but she sounds exhausted. Training was brutal today. \u201cI can float him if you can distract him enough for me to get close, Tokoyami.\u201d\nDark Shadow peeks out from behind Tokoyami\u2019s shoulder and whines at the BOOM and flash that greets it. Tokoyami shifts on his feet, sheepish. \u201cI\u2019m afraid Dark Shadow\u2019s still a little\u2026unsettled. From the sports festival fight.\u201d\nThe four of them stand there for a moment longer, each thinking of their aches and bruises and how much they do not want to try their hand at wrangling Bakugou Katsuki. But\u2014well, they\u2019re heroes in training and even if the student Bakugou is fighting seems to be holding their own, they really should do something.\nBut even Izuku, whose habit is to butt his head in Bakugou\u2019s business, is too worn out from Aizawa\u2019s grueling practice to muster up any sort of heroic intentions.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve known him for a while,\u201d Tsuyu says to him. \u201cIsn\u2019t there somebody in his life he\u2019d listen to? His mom, maybe?\u201d\nIzuku bites back a laugh. Kacchan? Listen to his mom? Those two are more like siblings than mother and son. Screeching one moment, asking what the other wants for dinner the next, no apology or acknowledgment of what passed moments ago.\nSometimes, he really feels for Bakugou Masaru. He can\u2019t imagine what life must be like, stuck between a volcano of a wife and a hurricane of a son.\n\u201cNot really?\u201d He scratches idly at his bandages. \u201cAll Might is the closest authority figure I can think of that Kacchan would listen to\u2014but you\u2019ve seen him with All Might.\u201d\nUraraka muffles a laugh. \u201cI don\u2019t think I know anybody else who would grumble at their idol like that.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe he\u2019s a tsundere,\u201d Tsuyu offers.\nIzuku chokes.\nUraraka giggles and pats his back. Tokoyami looks at Tsuyu like he can\u2019t believe what just came out of her mouth.\n\u201cYour mind is more disturbing than any darkness I\u2019ve known,\u201d he says.\nShe blinks. \u201cThanks.\u201d\n\u201cK-Kacchan?\u201d Izuku wheezes. \u201cA tsundere?\u201d\nHe tries to imagine it. His brain stalls. The idea that his childhood friend slash bully would\u2026would blush and stammer angrily after thrusting homemade food at their crush\u2026\nHe shudders. Nope, no, no way. That\u2019s just wrong. Bakugou hates people.\n\u201cOh man,\u201d someone says. \u201cNot again.\u201d\nHe turns to find Kirishima ambling up to them, hands in his pockets. His uniform jacket is tucked in the crook of his elbow and his shirt sleeves are rolled up. There\u2019s a bandage taped to his cheek and his hair is starting to flop into his eyes.\n\u201cOh, hi, Kirishima. What\u2019d Recovery Girl say about your shoulder?\u201d\nKirishima gives them a thumbs up. \u201cJust a sprain. She kissed it better, don\u2019t worry.\u201d\nAt that moment, there\u2019s another BOOM and a screech. With all this noise, it\u2019s kind of a wonder that nobody\u2019s come to investigate it.\n\u201cSo what\u2019s he mad about this time?\u201d Kirishima asks.\nThe four of them shrug. What isn\u2019t Bakugou mad about at any given moment? You could bet on literally anything and you\u2019d win.\nKirishima huffs a laugh. \u201cRight, well. I need to get home, so let\u2019s break this up.\u201d\nHe strides forward. Izuku, marveling in his easy confidence, only realizes what he\u2019s about to do when he starts to call out to Bakugou.\nThe blood drains from Izuku\u2019s face. \u201cWait\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBakugou!\u201d Kirishima yells, hand cupped around his mouth. \u201cHey! Cut it out, man, you\u2019re taking up the whole path!\u201d\nBakugou whips around, face contorted in a typical scowl. \u201cFuck you!\u201d\nBut all Kirishima does is grin and jog those last few steps to sling his arm around Bakugou. \u201cDon\u2019t be like that, dude. Aren\u2019t you tired from training?\u201d\nExplosions crackle over Bakugou\u2019s hands, but\u2014and here\u2019s the miraculous thing\u2014he doesn\u2019t move away. \u201cHah? Who the fuck do you think I am? That shit was nothing.\u201d\n\u201cTrue. Well, I\u2019m wiped, and Recovery Girl\u2019s healing sure didn\u2019t help with that.\u201d\nBakugou\u2019s eyes narrow. He still hasn\u2019t pushed Kirishima\u2019s arm off him. \u201cThat\u2019s your own damn fault. Know your fucking limits, idiot.\u201d\n\u201cBut you\u2019re the one always going all out, though?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s because I fucking can! I\u2019m better than all you assholes!\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d Kirishima sings, patting Bakugou\u2019s chest. Is he trying to\u2014to soothe Bakugou\u2019s ruffled feathers? Izuku feels his fingers twitch. He feels like he should be writing this down. But if Bakugou catches him, he\u2019ll die. \u201cStill, no need for you to blow up the walkway. C\u2019mon, let\u2019s get ice cream.\u201d\n\u201cTell me why the hell I should spend money just to be around your shitty ass a second longer.\u201d\n\u201cMy treat? It\u2019s a hot day, man. Indulge a little.\u201d\nAnd with an apologetic wave to the slightly charred student, Kirishima tugs Bakugou away from the fight. Just like that. They walk through the gates and disappear around the corner. The birds start chirping again. Peace is restored.\n\u201cI kind of feel like I witnessed something momentous,\u201d Tsuyu remarks after a moment.\nTokoyami nods. \u201cMidoriya, your mouth is hanging open.\u201d\nUraraka puts a finger under Izuku\u2019s chin and closes it for him.\n\u201cWhat the heck,\u201d he whispers.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd that\u2019s how the Kirishima and Bakugou Phenomenon Analysis starts.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen Izuku gets into something, he gets into it.\nHe\u2019s talking days and nights thinking about nothing but the thing. Obsessing until he can\u2019t sleep, collecting information like a dragon with its hoard, observing his chosen subject until his eyes are bloodshot.\nWith heroes, with All Might, he dives into forum boards and news articles, conspiracy videos and fandom, anything he could get his hands on. Skill stats, capture rates, quirk analyses, calculations and speculation, his own or made by others\u2014he writes it all down. Not to mention the figurines and hoodies and limited-edition duvet covers and toothpaste\u2014if they sold All Might bottled air, chances are, he would buy it. His mom is probably grateful they don\u2019t.\nBut the problem with his new interest is that\u2026\nWell, for one thing, Kirishima and Bakugou are his classmates. Obsessing over a public figure isn\u2019t too bad, but it\u2019s a different story when it\u2019s your peers and you could get labelled a Mineta for it.\nSecondly, where is Izuku going to get the same info on his classmates that he does All Might? They\u2019re not pro-heroes. People don\u2019t watch them, don\u2019t talk about them. Izuku\u2019s all on his own if he wants to figure this out.\nBecause that\u2019s what he\u2019s planning to do.\nHe\u2019s going to figure out what exactly is going on between Kirishima and Bakugou.\nBecause there is something there! He\u2019s sure of it, and it\u2019s\u2014to be honest, it\u2019s fascinating. He feels like he\u2019s on the verge of an earth-shattering discovery.\nFrom a young age, Izuku\u2019s made it a habit to study the people around him. To sharpen his mind. So of course he\u2019s studied Bakugou\u2014his moves, his behaviors. (It\u2019s a little creepy, he admits, but Bakugou used to bully him so turnabout is fair play or whatever.) Beside his parents, Izuku\u2019s probably the closest one to a Bakugou expert.\nSo this? This whole thing with Kirishima? With the harmless snarling and the acceptance disguised as unwillingness? The touching??\nIt\u2019s gold.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe next day, Izuku is ready.\nHe\u2019s got a new notebook lying open under the one he uses for class. He\u2019s at his desk, hunched over but eyes alert. He\u2019s going to observe the hell out of this.\nExactly ten minutes before class starts, Bakugou hooks his foot in the gap between door and wall and slides it open with a bang. Excessive as always. If it were Izuku, he\u2019d just push it open with the back of his hand to avoid leaving nitroglycerin on the door.\nPredictably, Bakugou clicks his tongue at the sight of him. Probably annoyed that he showed up first, never mind the fact that a couple of their classmates are here too.\nIzuku just averts his eyes and scribbles something meaningless on his schoolbooks. Appeased, Bakugou drops into his seat, chin propped on his palm.\nMindless chatter fills the class as the minutes tick by. Three minutes before Aizawa is set to arrive, Kirishima skids through the door. His tie is a little crooked, but his hair is perfectly spiked. Izuku nods. Priorities, he gets them.\nWith bated breath, he watches as Kirishima straightens, waves hi to Ashido, Sero and Kaminari, then turns to Bakugou and beams.\nOh my god, Izuku revels. It\u2019s real. There\u2019s really someone out there that likes Bakugou, that would smile upon seeing him. Oh wow.\n\u201cBakugou!\u201d Kirishima bounds forward. \u201cI tried that pain relief patch you told me about yesterday! You\u2019re right, my shoulder totally feels better.\u201d\n\u201cOf course I\u2019m right,\u201d Bakugou grumbles. \u201cOnly a dumbass wouldn\u2019t know the basics.\u201d\nBut Kirishima doesn\u2019t find offense, only clapping Bakugou on the back before moving to his desk.\nIzuku waits until Bakugou\u2019s attention is sufficiently occupied by his thoughts before picking up his pencil and scribbling down his notes at a carefully calm pace. He bites on his lip to make sure he doesn\u2019t mutter. It wouldn\u2019t do to catch attention, after all.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAt lunch, Bakugou sits at a corner table by himself, radiating an aura of \u2018don\u2019t even look at me\u2019 so strongly that the plants around him are practically wilting.\nBut this doesn\u2019t deter Kirishima in the slightest. After grabbing his food, he takes the seat opposite Bakugou and immediately engages him in conversation. Or tries to. From where Izuku is sitting, it looks like Kirishima is just throwing words at him until he says something so infuriating that Bakugou has to reply, just to tell him off.\nAdmittedly, it\u2019s a pretty good tactic. The key point here though, is that it\u2019s a tactic only Kirishima could pull off. His hardening quirk keeps him safe when Bakugou eventually blows up.\nIt\u2026actually looks like Kirishima is having fun.\nMiracle number two: there\u2019s someone who finds Bakugou enjoyable company. Izuku has never seen anyone laugh and smile so much around Bakugou. Usually they just cower and cry.\nIzuku takes a sip from his miso, eyes peering over the lip of his bowl. He really wishes he could hear what they were saying. The things that Kirishima say to Bakugou hit that perfect grey area of being critical without demeaning, appeasing without flattering. Izuku has no idea how it comes so naturally to him. \u2018Cause Izuku might know what makes his childhood friend tick, but that doesn\u2019t mean he can put that knowledge into practice. Everything that Izuku is, seems designed to make Bakugou hate him.\nThere\u2019s a metaphor here somewhere; Izuku knows Bakugou\u2026intellectually? Theoretically? But Kirishima knows Bakugou\u2026in practice? Physically?\u2014no, that\u2019s definitely not it.\nAs he\u2019s ruminating, Kirishima, without blinking, snags a piece of Bakugou\u2019s food and pops it in his mouth. Izuku sputters into his miso.\nThen he watches, gob-smacked, at the interaction that plays out in front of him. Because Kirishima doesn\u2019t die.\nInstead, Bakugou pops some harmless explosions, yells (probably something like, \u201cWh\u2014you fucking\u2014that\u2019s my food! Open your mouth, spit it out!\u201d) whacks Kirishima\u2019s hardened head, yells some more and then\u2014then he sits back down.\nHe sits down. And starts eating again. Angrily, but still. What?\nKirishima, on his part, leans back to brush soot from his face and just\u2026continues to smile that shark-toothed grin of his.\nAnd that\u2019s it. That\u2019s it. How is that all that happens? How?\nWhere\u2019s the face-stomping? The table-flipping? The fires and the screams of the damned and the property damage?\nIida hands Izuku a napkin. \u201cThere is miso on your chin.\u201d\nIzuku wipes his face with a shaking hand. He\u2019s vibrating in his seat; he needs to write this down immediately.\nSeriously; gold.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNow that Izuku is looking, he can\u2019t stop seeing.\nHe was wrong; this is easier than hero analysis. It\u2019s practically spelled out for him in 24-pt font. Bolded, italicized and underlined and thrown right in his face. He\u2019d have a harder time avoiding it.\nSure, to anyone else, it would look like Bakugou hates Kirishima just as much as any other \u2018extra,\u2019 but they don\u2019t pay attention to how close Bakugou lets Kirishima get.\nIn middle school, Bakugou had followers, but he maintained a strict three-foot distance from them at all times. Like a bubble of \u2018I\u2019m better than you and you should be grateful I even let your stank ass this close.\u2019 There was no arm-slinging, no fist-bumps or hip-checking. If Izuku\u2019s honest, it kind of looked lonely.\nThat mindset is probably why his attempts to reach out were always rebuffed.\nKirishima, on the other hand, reaches out not because of pity, but because he\u2026doesn\u2019t see why he shouldn\u2019t? Or maybe it\u2019s because he wants to? Kirishima is a straight-forward guy, and it\u2019s unfamiliar and baffling enough to disarm Bakugou. Even when he pokes fun, it doesn\u2019t throw Bakugou into an actual murderous rampage.\n\u201cBakugou. Hey, Bakugou, look.\u201d\nIzuku\u2019s gaze zeroes in on the scene across the training field. It plays out in slow motion: Bakugou grunts and turns his head\u2014and his cheek squishes under Kirishima\u2019s waiting finger.\nBakugou blinks.\n\u201cHaha, got you!\u201d Kirishima crows. \u201cDude, your skin is really soft. Do you do skincare or something?\u201d\nHis finger curls; the knuckle rubs against Bakugou\u2019s cheek. Izuku\u2019s almost kills himself holding back the squeak that threatens to erupt from him. He wheezes, hands clapped over his mouth.\nBakugou slaps an explosion to Kirishima\u2019s face.\nKirishima goes flying. When he lands, he\u2019s laughing. Laughing. \u201cOh my god, haha\u2014oh god, Bakugou, holy shit.\u201d\nBakugou stands over him, fuming, face fire-engine red. \u201cStand up. I\u2019m going to beat your ass.\u201d\nKirishima just grins and sweeps his legs out from under him. Bakugou goes down swearing, voice rising when Kirishima tries to pin him. They go rolling across the dirt, bumping into their classmates\u2019 legs. Explosions and laughter ring through the air and they don\u2019t stop until Aizawa wakes up, gives them the evil eye and erases their quirks.\nKirishima, no longer hardened, falls right on top of Bakugou. Bakugou\u2019s face bursts into flames.\nIzuku pulls out his notebook and writes in it so fast that the paper rips.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTheir quirks are compatible.\n\nTheir. Quirks. Are. Compatible.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKirishima gives Bakugou a noogie. Izuku didn\u2019t know that was even possible; that someone could get Bakugou under their arm like that and\u2014and ruffle his hair.\nEvery day, Kirishima is discovering uncharted land. Can\u2019t you get a medal for that or something?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTheir quirks. Are compatible.\nIzuku\u2019s never really thought much about romance, but God, isn\u2019t that a little too perfect?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe tries to figure out when it happened.\nWhen did Bakugou decide Kirishima was worth his time?\nWhen did Kirishima look at Bakugou and go, \u2018hm, I think I\u2019ll pick that one to annoy into friendship\u2019? When did he start to succeed?\nAfter much deliberation, Izuku guesses that the Calvary Battle was when Kirishima forcefully threw himself onto Bakugou\u2019s radar, yelling \u2018look at me!\u2019 He just knows Bakugou was impressed by Kirishima\u2019s declaration, his conviction to be unwavering, to be steadfast, and how he made it known that he\u2019d be expecting to take Izuku\u2019s one million\u2014that he\u2019d be expecting Bakugou to take it.\nA challenge and a show of faith, all in one.\nHe\u2019s not quite sure when Kirishima decided Bakugou wasn\u2019t completely an ass, though. It\u2019s unfortunate, but he\u2019ll have to leave that bit a mystery.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a mystery?\u201d\nIzuku jumps. \u201cOh! Todoroki, hi. Um, how much of that did you hear?\u201d\nTodoroki tilts his head. \u201cMm, not much. I\u2019ll get the hang of it soon, don\u2019t worry.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026not what I\u2019m worried about.\u201d Izuku frowns. \u201cYou look out of breath; were you sparring?\u201d\nTodoroki jerks a thumb over his shoulder. Through the classroom door come Jirou and Uraraka. The three of them are disheveled and covered in dust and dirt. \u201cThey asked me to help them with offense.\"\n\u201cHey, Deku. Are you doing homework?\u201d Uraraka asks, plopping into the desk beside him. \u201cUgh, I\u2019m so not ready for finals.\u201d\nJirou groans. \u201cGod, don\u2019t remind me.\"\nTodoroki frowns, confused. \u201cBut then how will you know when the test is?\u201d\n\u201cUm, actually,\u201d Izuku says, \u201cI was doing some\u2026side research. You guys remember when Kirishima stopped Bakugou from exploding a student?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to narrow it down,\u201d Jirou says wryly.\nUraraka snaps her fingers. \u201cAh, you mean that day Kirishima sprained his shoulder! What about it?\u201d\nIt\u2019s a calculated risk, bringing people into this, but Izuku thinks he needs to talk to someone to make sure he\u2019s not hallucinating.\nHesitantly, he offers his notebook to them. They crowd around, curious. Jirou flips the pages for them.\nWith every line, their eyes widen. By the end of it, Todoroki\u2019s eyebrows have disappeared under his hair. Jirou looks like someone hit her over the head with a pole, and Uraraka is grinning so madly that Izuku fears he\u2019s broken her.\n\u201cI knew it,\u201d she whisper-screams. She shakes Izuku by the arm. \u201cI knew there was something there!\u201d\n\u201cYou really are observant, Midoriya,\u201d Todoroki remarks. \u201cYou\u2019ve even marked down how many times Bakugou called Kirishima by his name.\u201d\n\u201cTrust me,\u201d Izuku says seriously. \u201cIt\u2019s significant. That\u2019s how you know you\u2019ve got his respect.\u201d\nUraraka pauses. \u201cHe called me by name during our fight.\u201d\nIzuku nods.\nShe considers that. \u201cIs it bad that I kind of feel happy about that?\u201d\nJirou sits down right there on the floor. Elbows to her knees, fingers laced over her mouth. \u201cHold on. Midoriya, you realize you\u2019ve uncovered a potential Bakugou-handler? In the wrong hands, this information could be abused.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re making Bakugou sound like a secret weapon of destruction\u2026\u201d Uraraka purses her lips. \u201cYeah, okay. I get your point.\u201d\nIzuku shifts his weight. \u201cSo, you guys see it? I\u2019m not crazy for thinking that Kacchan and Kirishima are friends?\u201d\nTodoroki hands him back the notebook. \u201cMidoriya, you might be crazy in a fight, but you make plenty of sense outside of it. Your observations are very astute.\u201d\n\u201cThanks\u2026?\u201d\nThe door slams open.\nAs if he was summoned, Bakugou stomps through wearing a vicious smirk. His training uniform is drenched in sweat. He looks so satisfied that Izuku feels an instinctive urge to hide under his desk. Bakugou grinning doesn\u2019t usually bode well.\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you extras looking at?\u201d\nTodoroki, as fearless as always, replies with, \u201cYou seem to be in a good mood.\u201d\nBakugou grins wider. Izuku sinks down in his seat. \u201cSo fucking what?\u201d\nUraraka, who Izuku is beginning to understand also has no fear of death, cheekily pipes up. \u201cJust wondering what could\u2019ve possibly accomplished that. Did you explodokill someone?\u201d\n\u201cHe sure tried to,\u201d a cheerful voice answers.\nKirishima stumbles through the doors. His uniform is ripped in multiple places; actually, his entire shirt is gone, and both pant legs are burnt off at the knee. Lines of hardening are still present along his arms and face, and he\u2019s smoking. Literally. Under their wide eyes, he pats out a faltering flame on his shoulder.\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d Uraraka says. \u201cWhat did he do to you?\u201d\n\u201cNothing he didn\u2019t ask me to,\u201d Bakugou grunts. \u201cBesides, he can take it.\u201d\nKirishima laughs. \u201cI sure can! I asked him what his Howitzer was like. That wasn\u2019t exactly what I expected when I asked for a demonstration, though.\u201d\n\u201cHow are you still standing?\u201d Izuku asks, half horrified, half amazed. That\u2014this needs to go in the book. Where\u2019s his pencil?\n\u201cThat\u2019s impressive, Kirishima,\u201d Todoroki says. \u201cI was knocked out cold.\u201d\nBakugou glares. \u201cThat\u2019s what you get for being a pussy. At least Kirishima has the guts to come at me with full force.\u201d\nIzuku flips to a previous page and makes another tally next to \u2018# of Times Kacchan Called Kirishima By Name.\u2019 He also jots down, said Kirishima has courage (in a roundabout way)!!\n\u201cDeku, what the fuck are you scribbling about?\u201d\nIzuku squeaks. \u201cUh, nothing, Kacchan! It\u2019s\u2014um. Haha!\u201d Yeah, okay, so he\u2019s not the best liar around.\nBakugou narrows his eyes. \u201cI swear to god, if you\u2019re taking notes on me again\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAlrighty then!\u201d Kirishima throws himself into Bakugou\u2019s eyeline, hanging off his shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t know about you, man, but I am parched. What do you say we head to the vending machines? Get something to drink, huh?\u201d\nAnd it shouldn\u2019t work, it shouldn\u2019t succeed in pulling Bakugou down from one of his infamous Deku-induced rages, except\u2014except it does.\nBakugou takes one long look at Kirishima\u2019s blinding smile, clicks his tongue and just...walks away. \u201cFucking\u2014whatever.\u201d\nThey watch him go. Silence descends.\nIn a turn of events, Izuku reaches over and closes Uraraka\u2019s mouth.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn the wake of his and Bakugou\u2019s final exam, Izuku finds himself saying, \u201cIf it had been you, Kirishima, it would\u2019ve been a different story.\u201d\nIt\u2019s late in the evening. Bakugou is definitely asleep, so Izuku deems it safe to take the seat across from Kirishima at the kitchen table. He slumps onto it, head pillowed on his arms.\n\u201cHow do you do it? How do you just\u2026work with him?\u201d\nKirishima puts a fork of apple pie in his mouth. Chews. Swallows. He\u2019s giving Izuku this concerned, understanding look and Izuku kind of wants to cry. \u201cI think this is probably a rhetorical question but\u2026it\u2019s not a matter of method or anything like that, Midoriya. I just\u2026don\u2019t have a history with him. Clean slate and all that.\u201d\nIzuku sighs. \u201cSometimes I wish we never grew up together. So I could just be another extra he hates, and not one he extra hates.\u201d\nThe plate of pie slides across the table. Izuku takes the offered fork and spears a bite for himself. Sato really does make the best pies.\n\u201cDo you think you two will ever\u2026\u201d Kirishima makes a nebulous gesture. \u201cGo back to\u2014being friends, or something?\u201d\nIzuku shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I want to. You know, when we were kids, we had all these plans about doing hero work together. Then\u2026well. Here we are.\u201d\nKirishima\u2019s mouth pulls down. He looks so sad on Izuku\u2019s behalf. Man, Kirishima really is a good friend. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened between you guys but\u2026it\u2019s probably going to take a while for him to apologize\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIf he does at all.\u201d\nKirishima\u2019s gaze hardens. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t, then he\u2019s not the guy I think he could be. A hero apologizes for their mistakes.\u201d Then, hesitantly, he asks, \u201cDoes it bother you? That I\u2019m trying to be friends with him? I don\u2019t want you to think I approve of his actions.\u201d\nIzuku bolts upright, waving his hands. \u201cNo! It doesn\u2019t bother me\u2014and I know you\u2019re not like that. You\u2019re really nice, Kirishima, and I\u2019m glad Kacchan has someone like you.\u201d\nNot to mention, it\u2019s a relief to have someone so impenetrable standing between him and Bakugou sometimes. And\u2026Bakugou would kill him for thinking this, but Izuku is used to worrying about his childhood friend. It\u2019s\u2014not even anything to do with Bakugou himself, that\u2019s just how Izuku is. So even when Bakugou was pushing him around, Izuku couldn\u2019t help biting his nails over Bakugou\u2019s one glaring weakness:\nThat he would refuse help.\nTo the point of his own defeat even. He\u2019d rather lose than take someone\u2019s hand.\nA hero like that would either rise to heights untouched. Or burn out before they could accomplish anything.\nFor the longest time, it looked like it would be the latter, but from what Izuku\u2019s observed recently\u2026\nWell, he just really hopes Kirishima doesn\u2019t give up.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBakugou is gone.\nThe villains are too strong and Bakugou is\u00a0gone. They lost.\n\nIf it had been you, Kirishima, it would\u2019ve been a different story.\n\nWould Bakugou have reached back, if it was him? Maybe. Probably not. They won\u2019t ever know. Izuku is grasping at hypotheticals, desperate. The outcome probably wouldn\u2019t have changed. It doesn\u2019t matter how many bones Izuku breaks, or how desperately Kirishima begs to join the fight.\nThe fact still remains that Bakugou was taken. And they were all too weak to stop it.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s disorienting to wake up and then immediately be presented with a very much illegal but tempting rescue scheme, to say the least. The last thing Izuku remembers is\u2014failing. Is Bakugou\u2019s furious expression, fear tinting the edges of it. Of his words, said through gritted teeth.\n\nStay back, Deku.\n\nFor the first couple minutes of his classmates\u2019 arrival, Izuku can\u2019t do much but stare owlishly at them. His mouth is full of cotton. If he blinks, he\u2019s going to cry.\nBut Kirishima\u2019s tortured statements and Todoroki\u2019s quiet but firm support slices through the haze of painkillers, the shock.\n\nIf I don\u2019t do something, how can I call myself a hero?\n\nThe words ring through him. An echo of a past event; a sentiment reflected in sunken eyes and a blinding smile; slime and a broken bottle; a thrown backpack, scattered school supplies and desperate red eyes.\nKirishima speaks and it leaves Izuku\u2019s heart racing. Douses him in equal parts frustration and hope. In that moment, Izuku feels like he\u2019s the only one in the room who might understand Kirishima completely.\nBut should they do it? Should they try one more time? Risk failure, one more time?\nHe wants to. The person that he is won\u2019t let him sit by.\nKirishima looks at him like he knows it.\nLike he\u2019s counting on it.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBehind a half-demolished wall, suspended in a suffocating snapshot, Izuku visualizes multiple paths diverging. A battle rages at his back. Saliva slicks the back of his throat, threatens to snap his airway closed. His finger twitches. An opportunity, just one, they just need one opening\u2014\nRed hair flashes at his peripheral.\nYour hands can still reach him, Kirishima said.\nBut Izuku hadn\u2019t been watching all these weeks for nothing. It\u2019s not his hands anymore. It\u2019s never been.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a way,\u201d he begins, and maybe one day his voice won\u2019t shake. One day, he\u2019s going to feel just as terrified and he\u2019ll be able to hide it behind a grin. But today, he\u2019s still fifteen and his body feels drained of blood and his words fade halfway through.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t,\u201d Iida rasps. \u201cMidoriya, we can\u2019t fight.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe not. But Kacchan can,\u201d Izuku replies. His gaze slides past Iida. \u201cAll he needs is you.\u201d\nShrouded in darkness, with a heartbeat so wild that it shakes the cheap gold necklace on his chest, Kirishima\u2019s mouth parts, a silent question.\n\u201cIt\u2019ll work,\u201d Izuku says, \u201cbut it has to be you.\u201d\nKirishima swallows. Nods.\nThey\u2019re not fighting, Izuku explains. They\u2019re going to fly.\nIt all hinges on Bakugou. They\u2019re going to put themselves out there, going to throw themselves into the fray like an impartial block of debris. They\u2019re going to wordlessly slice through the fog, high above the battle, inviting absolutely no reason to call them interlopers or rule-breakers. Their only fault will be when Kirishima extends a hand.\nWhen he locks eyes with Bakugou, throws out a lifeline, and challenges him to take it.\n\n\u201cCome!\u201d\n\nWhen Izuku hears the explosions, his mouth nearly rips from the force of his grin.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(Kirishima doesn\u2019t immediately let Bakugou go when they land. Bakugou doesn\u2019t force him to.)\n(Izuku doesn\u2019t write it down\u2014it feels too callous to\u2014but he knows exactly how many times Kirishima tries to hold Bakugou\u2019s hand before they finally drop him off at the station.)\n(He also knows how many times Bakugou almost forgets to pull away.)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow were you so sure that Bakugou would listen to Kirishima?\u201d\u00a0 Todoroki asks over the phone.\nIzuku lies in the dark, covers bunched at his feet. Down the hall, his mom is asleep. She\u2019ll get up in an hour and stand outside Izuku\u2019s room until she hears him breathing. He can\u2019t sleep, so he\u2019ll have to make sure his inhales and exhales sound slow and deep enough to reassure her.\nTodoroki can\u2019t sleep either. Izuku doesn\u2019t know why he decided to call, but he\u2019s glad for it. He wonders how Iida is doing. Yaoyorozu and Kirishima, too.\nAnd Bakugou.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that he listened,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cKacchan does what he wants and what he thinks is best. All we did\u2014what Kirishima did\u2014was provide him with that best option.\u201d\nTodoroki hums. \u201cAs if we were just a rope that he used to escape. We didn\u2019t rescue him; he did it himself, using us.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s how he thinks of it, yeah.\u201d Izuku rolls onto his side, phone balanced on his ear. \u201cBut that rope had to be sturdy. Reliable. Kacchan wouldn\u2019t just trust any old string to hold him up. His pride wouldn\u2019t let him.\u201d\nA moment of silence. Through the window, the light of the streetlamp flickers. The shadows in Izuku\u2019s room jump.\n\u201cBakugou\u2019s rather convoluted, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Todoroki says finally.\nA puff of laughter leaves Izuku. Todoroki\u2019s brand of blunt honesty always gets him. With his voice in Izuku\u2019s ear, he can almost forget the earth-crushing weight of All For One\u2019s presence.\nWhen Todoroki speaks next, he\u2019s subdued. \u201cMidoriya,\u201d he says. \u201cI want to apologize.\u201d\nIzuku frowns at his wall. \u201cWhat for?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen the marbles fell from the villain\u2019s grasp, Shouji managed to grab Tokoyami. I was a second too late. I could\u2019ve used my quirk, fire or ice or both\u2014I could\u2019ve frozen the hand that stole Bakugou, or trapped the marble in a block of ice thick enough to buy us time. Looking back, there were so many ways I could\u2019ve caught him.\u201d\n\n\u201cTodoroki\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSo I just want to apologize, for not being quicker. Smarter. The way you cried after\u2026\u201d A slow inhale. A sigh. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t prevent that hurt for you.\u201d\nInexplicably, his words fill Izuku with a strange warmth. It curls just under his throat and makes it hard to speak. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to apologize for that. It wasn\u2019t your fault. I\u2019m grateful for the fact that you tried until the end.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026If you say so.\u201d Then, \u201cI might fall asleep soon, but will you\u2026do you mind staying on the line?\u201d\n\u201cNot at all. If you need anything, just say so. I\u2019ll be here all night.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat goes for me, too, Midoriya. Don\u2019t hesitate to bother me.\u201d\n\nIzuku smiles and tugs the covers over himself. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMoving into the dorms provides Izuku with way too many chances to observe. It also forces him to get two new notebooks. He labels them #2 and #3\u2014no title, obviously. He\u2019s not suicidal.\nThey\u2019re filled with notes like:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cSomething wrong with your hands, dude?\u201d\nIzuku\u2019s gaze flicks up. Kirishima\u2019s stopped at Bakugou\u2019s desk. It\u2019s study period, which means that most of the class are on their phones or chatting. It also means that Kirishima will drift over to Bakugou at least seven times before they\u2019re dismissed. Sometimes, Izuku wishes he were less observant.\nBakugou grunts, kneading his knuckles into his palm. \u201cAches. Think I might\u2019ve gone overboard.\u201d\nKirishima hums sympathetically. He places a stack of papers on the edge of Bakugou\u2019s desk and holds out his hands. \u201cGive \u2018em here.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYour hands. Hand \u2018em over.\u201d\n\u201cYou and your fucking puns,\u201d Bakugou mutters, but does as asked.\n\u201cTell me if it hurts.\u201d\n\u201cIf what\u2014oh, fffuck.\u201d\nIzuku blinks down at his textbook. What. Was that\u2014um. He chances a look and yup\u2014Kirishima is massaging Bakugou\u2019s palms. In\u2014in class. Right in front of Izuku and seventeen other people and God himself.\nWhatever magic Kirishima is performing on those explosive hands has Bakugou hiding his face in the crook of his elbow and\u2014and grunting. Involuntary, nearly-silent noises that Izuku has never wanted to hear in his whole entire life.\nKirishima is oblivious. He continues rubbing and kneading, thumbs digging into the meat of Bakugou\u2019s palms. He manipulates calloused fingers, bends and stretches the knuckles. Pulls at stiff wrists and strokes the tension right out of Bakugou until\u2014well, until he\u2019s putty.\nHe lies there, completely limp, with his hands\u2014the source of his strength, his crowning pride\u2014in someone else\u2019s possession. Kirishima just fiddles with them like he has no idea the power Bakugou\u2019s surrendered to him.\n\u201cToo much?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cNnghh,\u201d Bakugou mumbles.\nIzuku looks around. Did no one see the softcore hand kink porn that just took place? Is\u2014did he hallucinate? Is this a nightmare?\nKirishima picks up the stack of papers, leaves one at Bakugou\u2019s desk (along with a\u2014a head pat. A fucking head pat\u2014yeah, Izuku\u2019s swearing now. He\u2019s allowed a swear right now), and hands one to Izuku. \u201cHere, from Mic. He forgot to hand these out last period.\u201d\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Izuku croaks.\nKirishima claps him on the shoulder. Izuku thinks about what that hand was just doing and shudders.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe worst thing is that he\u2019s pretty sure they\u2019re not even together yet.\nThey just go around like this, wrapped up in each other so completely that it\u2019s a wonder they don\u2019t walk straight into a tree. It might be cute, if it weren't Bakugou. And if it weren\u2019t so pitiful.\n\u201cHey, let me borrow your lap for a bit.\u201d Kirishima doesn\u2019t even wait for a confirmation, just flops onto the couch and buries his face in Bakugou\u2019s stomach.\nWithout looking up from his phone, Bakugou shoves at Kirishima\u2019s forehead. \u201cNot your goddamn pillow.\u201d\n\u201cPlease, Blasty? I\u2019m exhausted.\u201d\n\u201cYou fucking stayed up playing Animal Crossing, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cNo\u2026\u201d\n\u201cGet off me. Liars don\u2019t get lap privileges.\u201d\nLap privileges. \u2018Liars don\u2019t get lap privileges\u2019? Implying that Kirishima has gotten them before? Unbelievable. This can\u2019t be real. Izuku begins to consider if maybe Bakugou has been suffering under some sort of personality-warping quirk this whole time.\nLike, Izuku is still in the room\u2014granted he\u2019s hiding around the corner, but\u2014does Bakugou not see him? How is he okay with Izuku witnessing this? This is the common floor; anyone could walk in and see this!\nBakugou starts carding his fingers through Kirishima\u2019s hair.\nNope. Nope, that\u2019s it.\nIzuku lies down on the carpet and puts his notebook over his face. He gives up. He\u2019s officially done. He can\u2019t do this anymore. They\u2019re so in love and they can\u2019t even see it. They\u2019re practically married. Next month, they\u2019re probably going to adopt a cat or something. God, he hates it here.\nSomeone lifts the notebook away. It\u2019s Todoroki, kneeling by his head.\nHe blinks down at him. \u201cAre you alright, Midoriya?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Izuku folds his hands over his stomach. \u201cHave you ever met someone so dense they wouldn\u2019t know someone was flirting with them if their life depended on it?\u201d\nAmusement flashes over Todoroki\u2019s face. \u201cYes.\u201d\nIzuku nods in commiseration. Of course Todoroki would understand him. \u201cIt\u2019s the worse. I just want them to get together already!\u201d\n\u201cAh, you\u2019re talking about Bakugou and Kirishima.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re so obvious, yet so blind.\u201d Izuku drags his hands over his face. \u201cIt\u2019s driving me insane.\u201d\nTodoroki presses his lips together in that way he does when he\u2019s trying not to laugh. \u201cI know what you mean. I\u2019m going through something like that myself, actually.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d\n\u201cYes, there\u2019s someone I\u2019m interested in. I\u2019ve been trying to make it known to them but I think I\u2019m being too subtle.\u201d\nHearing that kind of makes Izuku uncomfortable for unknown reasons. He frowns. Maybe he has indigestion. He reaches up and pats Todoroki\u2019s knee. \u201cSorry to hear that, Todoroki. Whoever it is, I hope they realize it quickly.\u201d\nTodoroki does that endearing laugh-exhale. He picks a speck of lint out of Izuku\u2019s hair. \u201cMe too, Midoriya. Me too.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIzuku is pretty sure there\u2019s a saying about how something that\u2019s healed wrong has to be rebroken to heal right.\nHe doesn\u2019t know how medically accurate that is, but it\u2019s a metaphor that suits the fight he has with Bakugou pretty well.\nThey beat each other to a pulp. Until they\u2019re swollen and limping and their teeth ache so bad that Izuku wonders if his might fall out, and whether he\u2019s going to need dentures at the ripe age of fifteen.\nIt\u2019s simultaneously the stupidest and most cathartic thing Izuku has ever done.\nThey tell Aizawa they won\u2019t do it again, but if Izuku went back in time, he\u2019d still do it. He thinks they needed it.\nBakugou looks at him like he sees him now. Like he sees Izuku simply as the potential rival he could be, and not as the amalgamation of Bakugou\u2019s numerous complexes, his fears and his failures.\nHe supposes that\u2019s as good as it\u2019s going to get between them.\nWhen Bakugou gives him advice on his shoot style, he barely manages not to run for his notebook to document the moment. His mouth still goes all wobbly though. Bakugou clicks his tongue, because he knows Izuku just as well, too; knows just how much of an emotional nerd he is.\nKirishima catches him after class, pulls him into the stairwell while Bakugou gets into a yelling match with Iida about homework secrecy or something. \u201cPlease tell me this was a mutual beat-down and that I didn\u2019t end up comforting Bakugou for some unheroic actions last night.\u201d\nRight. That last bit is going in notebook number three.\n\u201cUm, he started it, but I\u2014I went full-force, too.\u201d\nKirishima sags against the wall in relief. \u201cThat\u2019s good. Not that you fought, I mean. But I could tell from his injuries that you gave as good as you got. And he seemed really torn up about something. It didn\u2019t seem like a regular bout of anger.\u201d\nIzuku rubs his neck. \u201cYeah, we\u2026some issues got resolved last night. Kacchan was keeping a lot bottled up and it\u2026\u201d\nHe mimes an explosion, sound effects included.\nKirishima laughs. \u201cOf course. What was I expecting? Are you guys going to be okay, though?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Yeah, I think so,\u201d Izuku nods. He matches Kirishima\u2019s smile. Then, shifting his weight, he asks, \u201cSo\u2026you comforted him?\u201d\nThe blood drains from Kirishima\u2019s face so quickly that Izuku thinks he might faint. \u201cI\u2014he\u2014look, it\u2019s not what you think, he just\u2014he wanted to rant and\u2014I say \u2018comforted\u2019 but really I just lied there and let him do whatever and he just slept in my bed and\u2014wait, that doesn\u2019t sound any better\u2014listen, Midoriya, I\u2014are you\u2026are you laughing?\u201d\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Izuku gasps. He wipes his eyes, stray giggles slipping out. \u201cSorry, you just\u2014you sounded so panicked.\u201d\nThe look Kirishima fixes him with is part exasperation, part amusement. \u201cYeah, well. Bakugou threatened to kill me if anyone knew he needed hugs sometimes, and you\u2019re probably the worst person to find out. No offense.\u201d\nIzuku waves a hand. \u201cAh, I knew about him seeking you out after the first week we moved in. \u201c\nKirishima opens and closes his mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re really scary sometimes, you know that?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to tell him I know. I value my life.\u201d\n\u201cHah, true.\u201d\nA natural lull falls over them and Kirishima looks out the stairwell door to the common floor. Izuku follows his gaze right to Bakugou. He\u2019s angrily wiping the windows while Kaminari eggs him on.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you were there for him,\u201d Izuku says.\nIf he hated Bakugou, he\u2019d find it unfair that Bakugou gets something this good and this right with Kirishima. But he\u2019s honestly just relieved.\nMaybe it\u2019s a leftover thing from their childhood. Maybe Izuku will never be able to let go of those days chasing after beetles and butterflies in the summer with the closest thing he has to a brother. Maybe he\u2019ll always worry, always feel a weird mix of fond exasperation for Bakugou, and maybe it means he\u2019s genuinely happy that Bakugou found someone to let in.\nIt must show on his face because Kirishima smiles and pulls him into a hug. \u201cAnd I\u2019m glad you guys worked it out.\u201d\nAnd it\u2019s a nice hug. It\u2019s a nice conversation, it\u2019s a nice day, the whole thing is such a surprisingly positive outcome to a situation Izuku feared would rip apart completely and it\u2019s all\u2014so unbelievably nice.\nNot for the first time, he\u2019s grateful that he made it into UA. That he\u2019s surrounded by amazing heroes-to-be. Aw man, he\u2019s going to cry again. He\u2019s been trying so hard to break out of that.\nAnd of course that\u2019s the moment Bakugou pushes open the door.\n\u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d he says.\n\u201cHey, Bakubro! Wanna join?\u201d Kirishima beckons him forward with a flick of his fingers. \u201cC\u2019mon, bring it in, man.\u201d\nBakugou takes a step. He raises an open palm.\nIzuku runs.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPart of Izuku\u2014the part that\u2019s tired of being bombarded by Kirishima and Bakugou\u2019s sickeningly sweet pining\u2014wants to just shove them together and tell them to kiss already.\nBut he\u2019s trying to be an impartial observer and well\u2026 it\u2019s also kind of funny watching Bakugou fumble his way around feelings. Finally, something he isn\u2019t good at.\n\u201cWhat are you smiling about, Midoriya?\u201d\n\u201cHm?\u201d Izuku pulls himself out of his thoughts. \u201cOh, uh. Nothing, really.\u201d\nA hint of a smile tugs at Todoroki\u2019s mouth and he leans back against his bed, arms crossed. He taps his pencil against his bicep, knee bumping against Izuku\u2019s under the table. Izuku wonders if he\u2019s using his quirk because the touch sends shivers up his spine. Todoroki, he\u2014he looks so\u2026cool. Even when he\u2019s just sitting, it\u2019s graceful.\n\u201cYou know you were mumbling, right?\u201d he says.\nIzuku freezes. \u201cW-what?\u201d\n\u201cSomething about Bakugou being funny. That\u2019s all I got. Did he do something?\u201d\nOh, okay, that\u2019s what he was talking about. For a second there, Izuku thought he was going to have to hurl himself out the window.\n\u201cJust\u2014him and Kirishima, and his\u2026stunted emotional growth.\u201d\n\u201cAh, I see.\u201d Todoroki huffs a laugh. \u201cYou know\u2026yesterday in our supplementary lessons, I caught him texting Kirishima.\u201d\nIt doesn\u2019t seem particularly noteworthy; friends text each other. Except Todoroki has a sly look in his eyes that suggests that isn\u2019t all.\n\u201cHe was blushing,\u201d Todoroki reveals, visibly struggling not to smirk, \u201cbecause Kirishima had sent him a post-workout selfie.\u201d\nIzuku claps his hands over his mouth. \u201cNo! Oh my\u2014seriously?\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d Todoroki snickers. \u201cI leaned over and he didn\u2019t even notice; he was so preoccupied. Stared at it for a whole minute. Full body blush and everything.\u201d\nIzuku collapses onto the desk, laughing.\nThat\u2014oh god, that\u2019s the funniest thing he\u2019s heard all week. Bakugou getting thirst-trapped so hard he basically stalls like a computer? And loses sense of his surroundings? All because Kirishima sent him a sweaty, most-likely topless selfie?\n\u201cBut the funniest thing,\u201d Todoroki continues, \u201cwas when I went, \u2018Kirishima really likes working out, huh?\u2019 and Bakugou jumped\u2014like six feet in the air\u2014and then turned around and nearly Howitzer\u2019d me for\u2014and I quote\u2014 \u2018even daring to look at Shitty Hair with your shitty eyes what the hell are you trying to do you trying to get with my best friend huh well guess what you can fuck right off Half-n-Half or I\u2019ll shove a stick of dynamite up your ass!\u2019\u201d\n\u201cStop,\u201d Izuku gasps, \u201cTodoroki, please, I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t even pause to breathe during the whole thing. I thought he was trying to do an impression of you, to be honest.\u201d\n\u201cOh god, don\u2019t let him hear you say that. He\u2019ll kill you.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to kill me for flirting with his boyfriend anyway, might as well.\u201d\nIzuku wheezes.\nJust when he\u2019s caught his breath, Todoroki says abruptly, \u201cYou\u2019re even cuter when you laugh, Midoriya,\u201d and it sends him into another coughing fit.\nTodoroki hands him a water bottle, from his mini-fridge, because he\u2019s rich and hilariously petty so he used as much of Endeavor\u2019s money as he could in outfitting his room and this is irrelevant but\u2014just\u2014what did Todoroki say???\n\u201cI said you\u2019re cute,\u201d Todoroki states, throwing Izuku\u2019s heart into cardiac arrest a second time.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d Izuku blurts, for some unfathomable reason.\nSilence.\nTodoroki\u2019s mouth twitches.\nIzuku lies down on the floor. Pulls his tshirt over his face and curls into a ball. Kill him. Just kill him. Where\u2019s Bakugou when you need him to explodokill you?\nRustling. Something settles down next to him. Izuku can\u2019t look because the sight of Todoroki lying beside him might actually make him activate Full Cowl and punch his way through all five floors to get away.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think an apology is the usual response to a compliment,\u201d Todoroki muses.\nIzuku groans. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t speak.\u201d\nA chuckle. Then, two points of contact on his wrists, one warm, one cool. Todoroki tugs his hands away. He hooks a finger in Izuku\u2019s shirt collar and pulls it down, brushing his nose. It\u2019s a touch so gentle that Izuku shivers.\nHe blinks his eyes open, hesitant. His breath catches.\nTodoroki lies on his side, a foot away. His hair splays across the tatami mat, red-white and silky, begging Izuku to run his fingers through it. To brush it away from those eyes.\nThose eyes.\nTodoroki is looking at him with those eyes, with grey, with cobalt blue, with so much affection that Izuku might suffocate under it. Izuku wants to suffocate.\n\u201cYou can when it matters,\u201d Todoroki whispers. \u201cYou always do, Izuku.\u201d\nHis thumbs are pressed to Izuku\u2019s wrists, to his pulse, beating halfway to heaven, lightning quick. His gaze roves over Izuku\u2019s face, his parted mouth, his collarbone, where his shirt has slackened enough to invite the heat in Todoroki\u2019s eyes.\nHe cups Izuku\u2019s face.\n\u201cTell me to stop,\u201d he says, a breath away.\nIzuku doesn\u2019t.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIzuku is in the kitchen, crouching by the cabinets, when he hears Bakugou encourage someone for the first time.\n\u201cWhat the fuck are you talking about?\u201d It\u2019s a question, but Bakugou\u2019s gruff tone clearly intends it as anything but. \u201cWho said you couldn\u2019t compete with the rest of us?\u201d\nIzuku pauses, hand on a bag of rice crackers. That\u2026sounded suspiciously like Bakugou was getting annoyed on someone else\u2019s behalf.\n\u201cNo, I mean\u2014I don\u2019t have ranged attacks like you guys, you know?\u201d That\u2019s Kirishima\u2019s voice. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard to stand out as I am now. Blunt force only gets you so far.\u201d\nIzuku frowns. Now that\u2019s just blatantly untrue. There are so many applications for Kirishima\u2019s quirk. Fit for defense and offense, for rescue and capture; it\u2019s one of the most solid abilities Izuku\u2019s seen. To be honest, he\u2019s a little jealous of how many hits Kirishima can take. Considering all the beat-downs Izuku\u2019s gone through, having some sort of defensive ability to stop all his bones from breaking would be a literal lifesaver.\nEvidently, Bakugou agrees.\n\u201cStand out\u2014? Why are you worrying about stupid shit like that?\u201d Bakugou grunts. \u201cLook, you were there at Kamino. You fucking saw how All Might refused to fall. And you\u2019re the one that told me you\u2019d never waver. That, right there\u2014that ability to keep standing, to not break\u2014isn\u2019t that already pretty fucking cool?\u201d\nWow. Izuku blinks at the rice crackers in surprise. That\u2014was definitely encouragement. Bakugou didn\u2019t even mess it up by calling Kirishima a dumbass or anything. Didn\u2019t know he could do that. Izuku\u2019s weirdly proud.\n\u201cDamn, Blasty! That\u2019s a hell of a compliment!\u201d Kaminari exclaims. \u201cDo me next! What am I good at?\u201d\nThe response comes immediately. \u201cFucking nothing.\u201d\n\u201cAw, come on!\u201d\nIzuku stays hidden a bit longer, curious, but he doesn\u2019t hear Kirishima say anything more.\nYeah, he\u2019d be stunned silent himself if Bakugou ever said a nice word to him, let alone give him an entire motivational speech.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKirishima is in the hospital.\nThe look on Bakugou\u2019s face when Izuku comes back with just Tsuyu and Uraraka is the closest thing to devastation that Izuku\u2019s ever seen on him. Even when it\u2019s clarified that Kirishima is very much alive, just injured, that expression fails to hide itself.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not good,\u201d Shouto says quietly, as the two of them watch Bakugou slink off to the elevator. His shoulders are drawn tight enough to snap.\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not,\u201d Izuku murmurs.\nAround him, his classmates are loud in their concern and their congratulations. Uraraka and Tsuyu are glowing from the praise, though exhaustion shadows their smiles.\nAnd Shouto\u2014he tries to conceal it, he\u2019s careful not to touch Izuku\u2014but the way he leans into Izuku\u2019s space is telling. Like he wants to envelope Izuku all around, tuck him under his chin and never let go.\nHe\u2019s worried. Izuku stands before him, safe and whole, and Shouto is still worried.\nKirishima is in the hospital. Kirishima can\u2019t stand. Bakugou can\u2019t see him. How much worse does it feel?\n\u201cIs there anything you can tell him?\u201d Shouto asks, because he\u2019s kind and sincere and he knows Izuku can\u2019t let anything be. In fact, he\u2019s said that he loves Izuku for it.\n\u201cI doubt he wants to see me.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a phone.\u201d\nThe text conversation he has with Bakugou hasn\u2019t been used since the Hosu incident, with his mass location text. It\u2019s a little disconcerting to open it up, to text in Kirishima\u2019s hospital room number. He considers saying something more, like he\u2019ll be okay, or he would want to see you, or don\u2019t yell at him too much, but they\u2019re not there yet. And Bakugou\u2019s never liked Izuku\u2019s platitudes, anyway.\nHe waits. The read notification pops up, but there\u2019s no reply. He doesn\u2019t know what to think about the fact that he doesn\u2019t even get a who the fuck is this text. It's telling. He hadn\u2019t thought Bakugou would keep his number.\nShouto links their pinkies together, the action shrouded between their bodies. \u201cWill you come up to mine for a bit?\u201d he asks.\nIzuku can see how the night will end. They\u2019ll start on the floor, but Shouto\u2019s futon will already be laid out and they\u2019ll migrate to it sooner or later. Shouto will want to see his injuries; the bandages on his body, the fatigue in his mind. He\u2019ll want to hear about it all, whatever Izuku will give to him. And then he\u2019ll pull Izuku under the covers, tuck his head under Izuku\u2019s chin and hold him. They\u2019ll fall asleep, and when they wake up the next morning, Izuku\u2019s heart will be full to bursting.\nHe pockets his phone. \u201cLet me change first.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKirishima recovers.\nIn the week that it takes, Bakugou is scarcely seen around the dorms. He leaves immediately after class, strides long and purposeful, and the first time Kaminari asks him where he\u2019s going, Bakugou just gives him a derisive look. As if they should know. As if he\u2019s daring them to think he\u2019d be embarrassed about this. About visiting Kirishima every day with a homemade meal stuffed in his school bag.\nKirishima is released. Bakugou escorts him back to the dorms. The moment they walk through the doors, Kirishima gets mobbed by their classmates.\n\u201cYou worried me half to death!\u201d Kaminari wails, clinging to Kirishima\u2019s waist.\nBakugou clicks his tongue. \u201cOff, Pikachu. His skin\u2019s still sensitive.\u201d\nKaminari backs off and sends Bakugou a smirk. \u201cThere you go, mother-henning again. Hey, Kirishima, how was your boyfriend\u2019s cooking?\u201d\nThe class bursts into laughter as red blooms over Kirishima\u2019s face. Oddly, Bakugou doesn\u2019t react at all, only wearing a vague expression of boredom on his face.\n\u201cHe\u2019s not my\u2014Denki!\u201d Kirishima pushes Kaminari onto the couch.\n\u201cObviously, he\u2019s not your Denki\u2014he\u2019s your Katsuki!\u201d Mina pipes in.\n\u201cOh, not you too!\u201d\n\u201cMan, you\u2019d be the luckiest husband ever,\u201d Sero adds. When Kirishima dives for him, he cackles and swings himself away with his tape.\nIt all devolves into a game of tag after that, light-hearted and jovial. Iida tries to lecture them on proper indoor activities, but even he joins in when Jirou tags him.\nThe only one not playing is Bakugou. He\u2019s still standing by the front door, leaned against it with Kirishima\u2019s hero costume case at his feet. And he\u2019s\u2026\nHe\u2019s smiling.\nIt\u2019s subdued. It\u2019s not a smile that anyone else would make\u2014it\u2019s just a minuscule uptick of his mouth, a loosening of his brows, an openness in his eyes. But for a boy who frowns constantly, it\u2019s not something you could miss.\nThis smile is fond. This smile is\u2014good, like the way a hero is good\u2014and this smile is all for Kirishima. It\u2019s directed at his back, at his laughter and his enthusiasm for his friends, at the fact that he\u2019s healthy enough to jump around. Bakugou is smiling, because Kirishima is here and he\u2019s happy about it.\nIzuku politely looks away; it feels too private for him.\nHe hopes that one day, Bakugou will direct that smile at Kirishima\u2019s face.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis is how Kirishima and Bakugou get together:\nSupplementary lessons seem to be a special kind of hell. Shouto regularly comes back bruised like an apple. He and Bakugou don\u2019t complain about it, obviously, but anyone can tell how drained they are every day.\nAnd today\u2019s lesson is vicious, apparently. So much so that when the two arrive back at the dorms, Bakugou makes a beeline for Kirishima, who\u2019s sprawled out on one of the couches, carelessly drops his costume case to the floor and\u2026lies down on top of him.\nJust\u2014straight up cuddles into him.\n\u201cB-Bakugou?\u201d Kirishima squeaks.\nIzuku notes that his alarm has more to do with how the most of the class is gaping at them, and less to do with Bakugou\u2019s actions itself. His body looks pretty attuned to Bakugou, shifting to accommodate him, arms instinctively curling around his shoulders.\nKirishima looks up and meets Izuku\u2019s eyes. Feeling sly, Izuku winks. Kirishima blushes.\nSero points at the spectacle. \u201cWhat the fuck is this. What\u2014who the hell took over Bakugou\u2019s body?\u201d\n\u201cNobody,\u201d Shouto answers. He stumbles over to Izuku, yawning behind his hand. \u201cWe\u2019re just wiped out from the supplementary course.\u201d\nIzuku holds out his arms. Shouto crawls into his lap, eyes already closed and brows pulled together adorably. \u201cI\u2019m sure you guys did amazing anyway,\u201d he says, rubbing soothing circles onto Shouto\u2019s back.\nIt\u2019s a testament to his growth that Bakugou actually responds to Izuku with a vaguely friendly, mostly sleepy, \u201cHell fucking yeah we did.\u201d\nThough, maybe his lack of aggression should be attributed to a concussion from all the beatings in his lessons, because what he says next makes it obvious that he\u2019s a little out of his mind.\nHe clumsily takes Kirishima\u2019s hand and puts on his head. \u201cPet me,\u201d he demands.\nKirishima wheezes. Multiple people choke on their own spit. Sero looks like he\u2019s suffering from a stroke.\nBakugou presses down insistently. With a blazing red face, Kirishima obeys. The little sigh Bakugou releases just worsens the situation. It\u2019s such a uncharacteristically soft noise, and Izuku witnesses a couple classmates\u2019 eyes bug out.\nUraraka is slapping Iida\u2019s arm repeatedly, grinning manically. She catches Izuku\u2019s eyes and points violently at the scene. Izuku gives her a thumbs up. Iida squints at them like he thinks this is all their fault somehow. Rich, coming from a vigilante-seeking delinquent like him.\nUraraka clears her throat. \u201cSo this, um, does this happen? Often?\u201d\nKirishima looks at all of them helplessly. \u201cIf I answer that, he\u2019ll kill me.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s practically an answer in and of itself,\u201d Tokoyami points out dryly. Kirishima groans.\nSomewhere over Izuku\u2019s shoulder, Jirou mumbles, \u201cHe really is the Bakugou-handler, huh.\u201d\n\u201cCan you guys shut up,\u201d Bakugou grunts. \u201cGossip about us somewhere else, fuckers, m' tryna sleep.\"\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one that interrupted our class bonding time.\u201d\nBakugou just grumbles at them, looking about ready to fall asleep right there. Shouto is already a step ahead of him, snoring quietly into the crook of Izuku\u2019s neck. Just what did the instructors put them through today?\n\u201cSo like, when are you guys getting together?\u201d Kaminari asks. \u201cBecause like, as a bi, you guys are so gay it makes me feel a little homocidal.\u201d\n\u201cDo you mean homicidal?\u201d Tsuyu asks.\n\u201cNo, I mean homocidal. They\u2019re so gay and mushy and cute and I want to kill them. Kinda like cute aggression? But gay.\u201d\nSero squints. \u201cIsn\u2019t that just homophobia?\u201d\nKaminari snaps his fingers. \u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d\n\u201cBut you\u2019re bi.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\nThey wait for him to elaborate, but he doesn\u2019t.\n\u201cDo you ever make sense? Like, at all?\u201d Jirou asks, genuinely curious.\nMina shakes her head, giving it up as a lost cause. \u201cHe does make a good point, though\u2014why aren\u2019t you guys together?\u201d\nKirishima looks like he\u2019s just been told he has to fight All Might to the death. \u201cUh. \u2018Cause it\u2019s\u2026not like that?\u201d\nThey all look pointedly at where Bakugou is nuzzling into Kirishima\u2019s neck.\n\u201cHe\u2019s just. Loopy. He gets cuddly when he\u2019s exhausted.\u201d\nHah, as if. Izuku knows that is absolutely false. One hundred percent bullshit. In fact, Bakugou is ten times more likely to blow you up when he\u2019s tired. Two years worth of sleepovers and playdates can attest to that. Baby Bakugou was a terror.\nHe says as much, prompting Kirishima to send him a betrayed look. He shrugs. So what? He\u2019s sick and tired of this oblivious pining, too.\nMina levels a teal-painted finger at Kirishima. \u201cDon\u2019t ever lie to my face again. Just go out already, you idiots. Denki\u2019s right, this is sickening.\u201d\n\u201cOh my fucking GOD,\u201d Bakugou growls. His head pops up, hair askew from Kirishima\u2019s petting. He glares at all of them with bloodshot eyes. \u201cWill you fuckers shut the fuck up if we do?\u201d\nKirishima\u2019s eyes bulge. \u201cUh, Baku\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Shouto interjects crossly, eyes still shut. \u201cThey\u2019ll shut up, or else I\u2019ll shut them up myself.\u201d\nA chill travels through the room. Alright, so Shouto\u2019s the type to get cranky too. Izuku\u2019s putting that in his notebook\u2014the one for his boyfriend. Yes, obviously, he has one on Shouto, this is Izuku we\u2019re talking about here.\n\u201cFine,\u201d Bakugou declares. He rises onto his elbows, squinting down at Kirishima. \u201cYou like me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014is that a question?\u201d Kirishima asks hoarsely. He looks like he wants to dissolve into the spaces between the cushions. Izuku sees the moment he decides that denial is futile; he pinches his nose and sighs. \u201cYes, okay? Yes, I like you.\u201d\nBakugou nods. \u201cOkay. You like me, I like you\u2014why are you choking, it\u2019s not a surprise\u2014so we\u2019re going out this Saturday. You figure out where. Don\u2019t wear crocs or I\u2019ll blow them up.\u201d\n\u201cNot that your confidence isn\u2019t totally manly, as usual, but don\u2019t I get a say in this?\u201d\n\u201cWhy, are you going to say no?\u201d\nKirishima opens his mouth. Closes it.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. Right, so we\u2019re dating now, Eijirou. You\u2019re my boyfriend,\u201d Bakugou declares.\nAnd he does this thing with his hand like he\u2019s knighting Kirishima\u2014tap-tap on both shoulders\u2014and then he flops back onto him with a grunt.\nAaand that\u2019s it. Kirishima and Bakugou are now together, apparently. Just like that.\nEijirou, Kirishima mouths. He hides behind his hand, groaning quietly like he can\u2019t believe what happened. His blush is so bright that it puts Aoyama\u2019s navel laser to shame.\n\u201cWhat. The fuck,\u201d Sero wheezes. Kouda pats his back. \u201cBro, what the hell was that?\u201d\n\u201cOf course that\u2019s how he\u2019d do it,\u201d Ojiro mutters. Silently, he hands over a wad of cash to\u2014Aoyama? Multiple people do, too. Huh.\nWell, Izuku\u2019s glad it\u2019s all resolved now. He just has to write that bit down, and then he can finally stop taking notes. God; took them long enough.\nBakugou goes still. He slowly turns his head, the simple action somehow much more menacing than it should be.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says, which is a terrifying to hear, wow, Izuku never wants to hear him apologize ever again, \u201cdid you just say, \u2018taking notes,\u2019 Deku?\u201d\n\u201cUh,\u201d Izuku says, \u201cno?\u201d\nBakugou climbs off his newly-declared boyfriend. \u201cDid you fucking take notes? On me? Again?\u201d\nIzuku carefully shifts Shouto off his lap and onto Shouji\u2019s, who takes the weight without a blink. Good guy. \u201cLook, to be fair, I\u2019ve never seen you make a friend before. It was kind of fascinating.\u201d\n\n\u201cFascinating?\u201d\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d Momo interjects, \u201caren\u2019t you two childhood friends?\u201d\n\u201cNo, pretty sure Kacchan\u2019s just a brother I was cursed with,\u201d Izuku replies.\nBakugou is fully awake now. \u201cIf anyone here is cursed, it\u2019s me! For having your lame ass tail me everywhere, you damn nerd!\u201d\n\u201cYou say that, but whose mom was it that begged mine for playdates to occupy you from tearing up the wallpaper and throwing your toys out the window just to see glass shatter?\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds like him,\u201d Kirishima says. Then, as if something\u2019s just occurred to him, \u201cHold up\u2014Midoriya, that means you\u2019ve got to have baby pictures of him, right?\u201d\nBakugou freezes. His expression screams, don\u2019t do it Deku, I swear to god\u2014\nIn for a penny, in for a pound, as they say.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Izuku says, sliding into a ready stance. \u201cYeah, I do. You wanna see the one where he\u2019s crying because he ran too fast in the rain and slipped in the mud and his pants slid right off his diapered butt?\u201d\nSilence. Awed, amazed silence.\n\u201cThat would honestly make my year,\u201d Kirishima replies seriously.\nBakugou explodes them both.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd that's how they get together.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(Years down the road, there is a wedding.\nIzuku is asked to be best man. His speech goes like this:\n\u201cThose of you who know me, know that I\u2019ve never been good with speaking,\u201d he begins. \u201cI stutter and I mumble, and at the beginning of our friendship, my fiance had to train himself for a whole year to be able to follow along when I go on one of my tangents.\u201d\nLaughter. Shouto raises his glass, smiles.\n\u201cBut when Kacchan asked me\u2014threatened, really\u2014to do this, I knew exactly what to say.\u201d He pauses, relishing a little in the puzzled frown his childhood friend wears. \u201cIn fact, I think I\u2019ve been unknowingly preparing for this moment since our first year at UA.\u201d\nBakugou is properly suspicious now, because again, Izuku knows him and he knows Izuku, and contrary to popular belief, Izuku can be mischievous.\nHe pulls out three notebooks, pages worn-out and thick with ink. Bakugou shoots to his feet at the sight of them, a comical expression of terror on his face. Kirishima realizes a second later and buries his face in his hands, shoulders shaking.\nIzuku grins.\n\u201cIt is my pleasure,\u201d he says gleefully, \u201cto commemorate Kacchan and Kirishima\u2019s union by sharing some fond memories with you all.\u201d\n\u201cDeku, you fuck, don\u2019t you dare\u2014\u201d\n\u201cTo start, one time I caught Kacchan writing Kirishima Katsuki in his school notes. Another time, I caught him\u2014\u201d\nWith Kirishima restraining his husband, Izuku makes it halfway through the second notebook before Bakugou blows up the reception.\nHe considers it a success.)\n\u00a0"
