    "text": "\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo like, maybe Bakugou wasn\u2019t really the best choice for this whole pizza delivery shindig.\nFucking whatever. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s anywhere in town that actually sells good food, so nobody\u2019s expecting the local pizza joint to produce anything more than slightly edible. This whole stupid city is all skyscrapers and busy roads, but the only people who actually live here are either students or poor people. Usually both. Like Bakugou, really. Which is basically the only reason he\u2019s standing here staring at a patch of mould on the ceiling instead of lounging around at home, a warm pizza box balanced in his hand as the other one pounds on the door.\n\u201cPizza,\u201d he says very loudly. Doesn\u2019t yell, because he\u2019d yelled during a delivery yesterday and some old lady had come out of her house to hit him with a broom. Not that there are any old ladies here, probably. This looks like one of those shitty apartment buildings near UA campus that\u2019s occupied mainly by undergrads. Bakugou knows this because it looks like his own shitty apartment building, which is also near UA campus and is occupied by Bakugou, an undergrad.\nHe bangs on the door again. He\u2019s knocked like, three times in the past two minutes, and it\u2019s only now that he hears a voice from inside. Briefly, he wonders if he can get away with knocking even after the door\u2019s opened. Probably not. His manager puts up with his abysmal customer service because he\u2019s being paid almost nothing, but even Aizawa might draw the line at rapping your knuckles against a customer\u2019s face.\nThe door finally, finally swings open to reveal a boy on the other side of it looking harried. He\u2019s got a mess of wild hair and bright green eyes. Seems a bit young to be a UA student, but whatever. \u201cSorry, sorry! I didn\u2019t hear you coming.\u201d\nBakugou wrinkles his nose at the earbuds wrapped around the boy\u2019s neck. What kind of dumbass listens to music when he should be listening for the delivery guy, he wants to say, but decides it\u2019s not worth the effort. \u201cOne large cheese pizza,\u201d he drawls instead, looking at the receipt taped to the top of the box. \u201cFor Midoriya,\u201d he squints at Kirishima\u2019s shitty handwriting, \u201cDeku.\u201d\nThe guy at the door blinks. \u201cIt\u2019s, uhm, Izuku, not Deku.\u201d\nBakugou hands him the pizza. \u201cDon\u2019t care.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026right. Right, yes, okay.\u201d Somewhat hesitantly, Midoriya Whatever takes the pizza that\u2019s shoved into his hands. \u201cHow much did I owe you?\u201d\n\u201cHell if I know, check the receipt.\u201d\nHis eyes really are very green. Bakugou notices this because he\u2019s fixing him with a pretty stupid look, one that\u2019s really perplexed but also sort of reminds Bakugou of a deer just about to be run over by a pick-up truck. \u201cAre you not worried about me short-changing you?\u201d\n\u201cNo, because I know where you live and I have no problem beating those cutesy freckles right off you.\u201d\nWeirdly enough, the corner of Midoriya\u2019s mouth quirks upwards. \u201cWow. Did you, uh. Do you know what customer service is?\u201d\nBakugou snorts. \u201cNot a fucking clue. You gonna pay me or what?\u201d\n\u201cSure. Wait right there.\u201d Still not-quite-smiling, Midoriya shuffles away from the door and goes off to set the pizza somewhere safe. Bakugou nudges the door open a little further with a foot; from what he can see, one side of the studio apartment is immaculately neat, and the other looks like a wardrobe threw up on the floor. \u201cRight, here\u2019s your cash. I have to tip you in coins, though, sorry about that.\u201d\n\u201cMoney\u2019s money.\u201d Honestly, Bakugou\u2019s surprised he\u2019s getting a tip at all, seeing as he\u2019s consistently horrible to everyone he meets, but he\u2019s not about to look a gift horse in the ass. \u201cThanks. Enjoy your food poisoning.\u201d\nMidoriya jolts a little. \u201cFood poisoni\u2014what\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d\nBakugou laughs at him and leaves.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn all honesty, he never expected to end up here again.\n\u201cI\u2019m actually kind of impressed,\u201d he says to the squishy face poking out from behind the door. Midoriya\u2019s in a bright blue hoodie today. Bakugou\u2019s a little jealous. His uniform is a frankly itchy grey shirt with the company\u2019s ugly logo on the front. And a cap, which he refuses to wear because it gives him hat hair that Kirishima never shuts up about. \u201cNobody\u2019s ever ordered this shit twice. Did you actually eat the pizza or did you just give it to someone you don\u2019t like?\u201d\nMidoriya accepts the box with a grin. \u201cIt\u2019s cheap and I don\u2019t have a stove. I can suffer through a little food poisoning.\u201d\n\u201cYou some kind of masochist?\u201d\nMidoriya looks him up and down thoughtfully. \u201cYou know what, maybe I am.\u201d\n\u201cThe fuck are you looking at me for when you say that?\u201d\n\u201cNo reason.\u201d\nHis smile is a little unreadable, and Bakugou wants to punch him. Which isn\u2019t saying much, really, because Bakugou wants to punch most things, but right now Bakugou specifically wants to punch Midoriya. Only a little, though, because he still wants a tip. \u201cIf you\u2019re gonna torture yourself, you might as well be a man about it. Get a real pizza, not one of those pussy cheese ones.\u201d\n\u201cI like cheese,\u201d Midoriya says mildly. He wanders away from the door to get his wallet, just like last time, and Bakugou pokes his head in uninvited. Midoriya doesn\u2019t seem to mind. He sets the pizza on the kitchen counter and picks up the wallet. \u201cPlus, the cheese pizza is the cheapest one, you know?\u201d\nBakugou calls bullshit. There are a pair of bright red Air Jordans sitting by the door, and those things cost half a month\u2019s pay. Bakugou knows, because he\u2019d been planning to get some himself. \u201cJobs are a thing that exist.\u201d\n\u201cAh, yeah, I know. But I kind of prefer to live cheap and spend my free time studying, since working can be pretty tough.\u201d\n\u201cYou can do both, you lazy ass. I do, and I\u2019m doing just fine.\u201d\nMidoriya grins at him again. It\u2019s still annoying, making his eyes crinkle at the corner, and the stupid bastard looks like he\u2019s about to fucking giggle as he wanders back to the door. What a loser. \u201cWow. That\u2019s really impressive, actually. Are you in UA? What do you study?\u201d\n\u201cChem eng,\u201d Bakugou says without really thinking. \u201cI like making shit go boom.\u201d\nMidoriya\u2019s weirdly happy about that. \u201cOh, cool! I guess that would explain why I\u2019ve never seen you on campus, since I\u2019m always on the other end. I do government planning and econs. Are you a second-year?\u201d\n\u201cThird.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re holding down a job? You\u2019re good at this whole adult thing. I\u2019m a third-year too and I can barely drag myself out of bed most days.\u201d\nBakugou raises an eyebrow. \u201cHuh. Looks like the whole Deku thing really suits you, huh?\u201d\n\u201cI told you, that\u2019s not my name,\u201d Midoriya says, although he doesn\u2019t seem particularly upset. He\u2019s taking his own sweet time fishing through his wallet, too, and Bakugou taps his foot impatiently. \u201cBut I feel like you don\u2019t really care, somehow.\u201d\n\u201cAstute.\u201d Bakugou takes the money, plus tip, and stuffs it into his back pocket, glancing at the red shoes appreciatively one last time before he has to leave. \u201cOkay, now go away. I have a job to get back to, unlike some people.\u201d\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t let me stop you,\u201d Midoriya says pleasantly. Bakugou steps away from the door and turns to go, and Midoriya waves him goodbye. The lights of the dilapidated corridor flicker on slowly as he makes his way to the equally dilapidated staircase. \u201cBye, Kacchan.\u201d\nBakugou nearly falls down the stairs. \u201cThe fuck you just call me?\u201d\nMidoriya\u2019s still half-hiding behind the door, stupid face clearly pleased with itself even as Bakugou whips around so hard he feels his neck crack. The boy reaches up and taps his chest with a finger. \u201cYou have a nametag, you know.\u201d\nBakugou glances down. The little black nametag he barely wears is inexplicably on his shirt today. He stares at it, mystified, and it seems to stare back. Bakugou Katsuki, it tells him. \u201cThe fuck is a Kacchan?\u201d\nThat Cheshire kitten smile widens. \u201cIf you\u2019re gonna call me Deku. I think it\u2019s only fair.\u201d\nSeriously, what the fuck. \u201cI\u2019m not a pet dog, Jesus.\u201d\n\u201cI prefer Deku to Jesus.\u201d\nWow. \u201cYou know what, give me that pizza back so I can hit you over the head with it.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be like that! It\u2019s cute, I think it suits you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna hit you twice as hard now.\u201d\nMidoriya laughs. It\u2019s a fucking stupid laugh, all high-pitched and snorty and whatever, and it echoes down the corridor even as Bakugou stands at the top of the stairs like an idiot. \u201cSorry, you\u2019ll have to come back with another pizza if you want to hit me with it. I look forward to it, though.\u201d\nBakugou makes a face. \u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019m coming back?\u201d\n\u201cJust a feeling,\u201d he says, and manages to get the door shut just before Bakugou can wrench it back open and strangle him.\nHuh.\nBastard.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow is it,\u201d asks Aizawa, \u201cthat there have been three orders from the same address in as many weeks?\u201d\nBakugou looks up from his magazine. It\u2019s something about cars, he thinks, although he can\u2019t really be sure since he\u2019d just snagged it from Kirishima\u2019s backpack. \u201cIs that not, like, a normal thing that happens in restaurants sometimes?\u201d\nAizawa turns to look at him. His scarf is pulled tight around his neck even though the heat from the kitchen has spread to the front of the shop, so his voice is a little muffled. \u201cNot this restaurant. This restaurant is a shithole.\u201d\nKirishima pops his head out from the window to the kitchens. \u201cIt's your shithole.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m just the manager. I refuse to take responsibility for the actual food,\u201d says Aizawa. He\u2019s still got the receiver of their landline in his hand, and he sets it down next to the cash register where it belongs. \u201cI refuse to believe they genuinely want to eat what we give them. What\u2019s going on?\u201d\nKirishima makes a wheezy noise as he laughs. \u201cUhm, they obviously like my pizza.\u201d\n\u201cNobody likes your pizza. Your pizza is disgusting and so is Kaminari\u2019s. The only person here who can cook is Bakugou, and I don\u2019t like him being in the kitchen because then I have to deal with him.\u201d\nIt takes a lot of willpower for Bakugou not to hurl a chair in the old man\u2019s direction. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re the reason this business is suffering.\u201d\n\u201cI receive at least one new complaint about you every day, Bakugou, I think you deserve at least some of the blame.\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d Bakugou replies, exasperated. \u201cWe\u2019re the worst possible combination of pizza dudes, fucking whatever. But we have a regular, so we can\u2019t be completely hopeless. Let me guess, one large cheese pizza?\u201d\nAizawa blinks. \u201cHow did you know\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m your best employee.\u201d Sliding off his stool, Bakugou shoulders his way through the heavy kitchen door and shoos his co-worker out of the way. \u201cGet lost, I\u2019m cooking this time.\u201d\nKirishima stumbles a little on his way to the door, dusting his hands off on his apron. \u201cWhat, you want me to deliver?\u201d\n\u201cNah, I\u2019ll do it. I got us our regular, and I\u2019m gonna take care of him.\u201d\n\u201cShit, I\u2019m not complaining,\u201d Kirishima shrugs. He leaves Bakugou to his work and Aizawa slithers back into the shoebox of an office he came from.\nBakugou, slapping a ball of pizza dough onto the table with far more force than probably necessary, looks at the ingredients station and grins.\nHell, he\u2019s their star employee. It\u2019s time someone got creative with the menu.\nMayo and pineapple go together, right?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMidoriya\u2019s apartment building is exactly as ugly as Bakugou remembers it, although he raps on the door with a lot more enthusiasm than he did the last time. A bit of paint crumbles under his fist, and he surreptitiously wipes his hand on his jeans when Midoriya opens the door. \u201cHi.\u201d\nMidoriya blinks at him. \u201cHey, Kacchan,\u201d he says. Emphasises the Kacchan, like he\u2019s ready to bolt back into the apartment the moment Bakugou yells at him.\nBakugou does no such thing. Instead he picks up the receipt taped to the top of the pizza box in his hand and clears his throat. \u201cOne large cheese pizza for Deku.\u201d It\u2019s not a cheese pizza. It\u2019s covered in questionable ingredients and suspicious bits of seafood, and at this point it barely qualifies as a pizza. \u201cThe usual.\u201d\nDeku tilts his head like a puppy. \u201cYou\u2019re awfully chipper. Did something happen?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful day,\u201d Bakugou smiles at him. Grimaces, probably, judging by Deku\u2019s resulting expression. Also, it\u2019s not a beautiful day. It\u2019s raining. \u201cDon\u2019t you love being alive?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026yes? Did you hit your head?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just in a good mood,\u201d Bakugou says, handing over Deku\u2019s pizza and waiting patiently for payment in return. Deku glances at the box and then back at Bakugou, clearly a little suspicious. Bakugou keeps his smile (grimace) where it is. \u201cEnjoy your food.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, you\u2019re leaving already?\u201d\n\u201cPlaces to see, work to do,\u201d Bakugou says, practically bouncing away from the door. \u201cHave a nice life, Deku, see you next time.\u201d\n\u201cHey, wait,\u201d Deku\u2019s voice floats down the stairs, ignored. Bakugou\u2019s footsteps echo as he basically skips down the stairs to his scooter, and he straps on his helmet and swings himself into the seat. The engine starts up with a hum, and Bakugou accompanies it with a little hum of his own.\nA window slides open somewhere above him. \u201cKacchan, get back here with my pizza!\u201d\nBakugou cackles and drives off.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe next day, Aizawa pokes his head out of the manager\u2019s office to tell him that he\u2019s just got a call from the regular. \u201cHe wanted me to tell you that whatever you gave him was actually pretty good.\u201d\nBakugou frowns. Deeper than usual, since he\u2019s literally always frowning, but he steals into the kitchen when Kirishima isn\u2019t looking to poke around in the fridge. There\u2019s a leftover container of whatever he\u2019d used yesterday. It\u2019s off-white and slightly solid, and it looks like it would eat whatever spoon Bakugou tried to put in it.\nThen again, if Deku ate it, it can\u2019t be that bad.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTen minutes later, as he\u2019s still trying to scrape the taste off his tongue with a toothpick, he decides that it is, in fact, that bad.\nEh. Okay. He probably deserved that.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re not Deku,\u201d says Bakugou.\n\u201cNo,\u201d says the man at the door. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d\nHe\u2019s got a ridiculous dye-job; half his hair is white and the other red. His eyes are different colours, too, and they\u2019re currently narrowed at the pizza box held protectively in front of Bakugou\u2019s chest. \u201cWhat\u2019d you do with Deku?\u201d\n\u201cIzuku is visiting his mother,\u201d says the man testily. \u201cGive me my pizza.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you doing in his house?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s my house too. I live here, I\u2019m his roommate. Give me the pizza.\u201d\nBakugou gives him the pizza. Reluctantly, mind you, but he can\u2019t really think of a good reason not to hand the stupid thing over. He\u2019d been half-expecting Deku to yell at him about the experimental pizza thing, but he\u2019s not even here. Unless he\u2019s hiding in a cupboard somewhere, maybe, but there are no Jordans by the door. \u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s kinda weird to get food under someone else\u2019s name?\u201d\n\u201cWhat does it matter as long as I paid for it?\u201d says the stupidly bi-coloured customer, leaning against the doorframe. He\u2019s got the door fully open, unlike Deku. Deku likes to keep the door just slightly ajar so he can peek through it like a little kid. \u201cAnyway, you\u2019re the one who assumed it was Izuku calling when you took my order.\u201d\nAs if. This guy sounds nothing like Deku, but Bakugou hadn\u2019t been the one answering calls since it\u2019s Aizawa\u2019s turn today. Easy mistake to make. The restaurant has his details saved with his phone number, but still. \u201cHe never mentioned having a roommate.\u201d\n\u201cNo, because he insists on answering the door every time you people come here. I don\u2019t know why he won\u2019t just let me get Dominos. Your pizza tastes slightly worse than cardboard, I\u2019d be better off just eating the box.\u201d\nOh. Huh. That\u2019s...kind of flattering, actually. The Deku part, not the pizza part, although the pizza part isn\u2019t really much of a surprise. \u201cWell why the fu\u2014heck did you order it then?\u201d Customer service, Bakugou. You want a tip, remember? \n\u201cI was curious.\u201d Half-and-Half stares at him with suspicion in his eyes. His left eye, specifically, seems to be telling Bakugou to fuck off, and the right one looks like it\u2019s considering calling Dominos after all. \u201cThere has to be a reason he keeps subjecting us both to your cardboard pizzas.\u201d\n\u201cCould it be my stunning good looks? My sparkling wit? My riveting personality?\u201d\n\u201cI suppose. Izuku does have a fondness for collecting mangy strays.\u201d\nBakugou rolls his eyes. His hands stay resolutely in the pockets of his jeans instead of wrapping themselves around Not-Deku\u2019s neck where they should be, because Bakugou is a fucking saint with a willpower of iron. \u201cYou know that includes you, right, asshat? And I\u2019m not the one with a head that looks like a red and white candy cane.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s blood orange.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fucking red, you pretentious ass.\u201d\nHalf-and-Half\u2019s eyes narrow further, like a testy house cat. Bakugou wants to splash water at him. \u201cI don\u2019t want hair styling tips from an angry dandelion.\u201d\n\u201cAngry dande\u2014okay, fucking Christ, I\u2019m outta here. Are you gonna pay me or am I gonna have to stand here and listen to you all day?\u201d\nNot-Deku makes a noise that could be loosely transcribed as harrumph. \u201cI have absolutely no clue what he wants with you,\u201d he mutters under his breath, shifting the box around so he can get a couple of bills out of his back pocket. It\u2019s a precarious balancing act, and Bakugou makes no move to help. \u201cWhy is it always you who comes here? Do you really not have any other employees?\u201d\n\u201cProbably because I\u2019m the only one willing to come all the way here to deal your half-and-half dairy substitute ass?\u201d\nNot-Deku holds out the money, but Bakugou has to practically wrestle it out of his grip. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I like you.\u201d\n\u201cI definitely don\u2019t like you,\u201d Bakugou retorts, turning on his heel to leave. \u201cCall me when Deku gets back so I don\u2019t have to deal with you again.\u201d\nThe door snaps shut with an air of wooden finality. Striding towards the stairs, Bakugou takes a look at the money in his hand and grumbles all the way back to the parking lot.\nIt\u2019s exact change. Bastard didn\u2019t even tip him.\nFuck customer service, honestly.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cJesus Christ, come on, Deku,\u201d Bakugou says, banging on the door for the third time. Somebody shushes him from the floor below, and he leans over the balcony to yell back. \u201cYou shut up! Hey, Deku! I\u2019ve been waiting out here for ages, how dare you order a pizza and then not collect it?\u201d\nThe person shushes him again, and Bakugou just barely manages not to leap onto the lower floors so he can clobber them to death with his pizza. It would be a waste, anyway. Bakugou made this one himself, to make up for the other one. It is, naturally, fucking delicious. He shouldn\u2019t damage it.\nDamaging Deku, on the other hand, would be great. Huffing, Bakugou parks his ass facing the door and stretches his legs out, box balanced in his lap. It\u2019s warm and heavy, and it smells good. \u201cDeku, you better come out of there.\u201d\nDeku does not come out. For a brief minute, Bakugou\u2019s tempted to just leave. Go back to the shop and give the pizza to Kirishima, even though Kirishima did nothing to deserve it. But he made this for Deku, damn it. If Deku doesn\u2019t eat it, nobody\u2019s eating it.\nExcept Bakugou, maybe, cause he made it.\n\u00a0\nOh.\nActually.\nEh, fuck it.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s weirdly satisfying, eating a customer\u2019s pizza right in front of their house. He\u2019s right, of course; his pizza is fucking delicious, and he\u2019s glad he took the trouble to make it properly. It\u2019s cheesy and rich and thick, and he polishes off a slice in about three minutes. Cicadas chirp at him from somewhere in the distance. It\u2019s a nice night. Warm and dry even if he is sitting on a concrete floor staring at a doorframe that has mildew growing around the edges.\nMight as well eat another. \u201cI swear to god, Deku,\u201d he mutters around a mouthful of crust. \u201cIf this is some stupid prank from your half-and-half boyfriend, I\u2019m gonna kick his ass. I\u2019ll kick your ass too for messing with me. Hell, I\u2019ll kick my own damn ass, I\u2019m an ass-kicking machine and nobody makes me come all the way out here for no good reason just so I can sit here like a homeless person, who do you think you are\u2014 \u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a boyfriend,\u201d says a voice behind him, and Bakugou almost loses his shit, and the pizza.\nDeku\u2019s standing above him, plastic bag in one hand and the other held up in what he obviously thinks is a calming manner. He\u2019s in cargo shorts and an awful t-shirt, and from this vantage point, Bakugou notes that the Jordans are even nicer up close.\nBut no time to comment on that, because there\u2019s a chunk of pizza crust lodged in his windpipe. \u201cWhat the fuck are you sneaking up on me for?\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t sneaking!\u201d Deku protests. \u201cI just went out to get some soda, I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be here this early since it\u2019s been like, what, ten minutes\u2014are you eating my pizza?\u201d\nBakugou dares him to argue, eyes watering. \u201cYou were taking forever and I got hungry.\u201d\n\u201cSo you just helped yourself?\u201d\n\u201cWell I\u2019m fuckin' suffering for it now.\u201d\nDeku stares at him. For a really long time, blinking slowly, and then he just sighs and slides onto the ground next to him. \u201cYou\u2019re unbelievable, you know that? First a radioactive pizza, and now this.\u201d\nBakugou hands him the pizza box.\u00a0 \u201cAh, shut up. I made this special for you, you know.\u201d\n\u201cYou did?\u201d Deku perks up considerably. He inspects a slice at close range for a second, and Bakugou rolls his eyes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not toxic. I was just eating it, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen what you\u2019re capable of. I had to throw that last pizza out, you know. I missed dinner because of you.\u201d\nBakugou doesn\u2019t mention that he hadn\u2019t wanted dinner after trying that shit either. \u201cIf it makes you feel any better, there\u2019s some of that stuff left over in the fridge. I\u2019m thinking it might gain sentience if I leave it in there long enough.\u201d He\u2019s not kidding. He\u2019d opened the fridge to steal some salami slices yesterday, and he could have sworn the Tupperware was watching him.\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make me feel better and I still don\u2019t trust you,\u201d Deku says, but nibbles at it all the same. Almost immediately, his face lights up like a Christmas tree and half the slice disappears in one bite. Something flutters in Bakugou\u2019s chest. Might be satisfaction, might be fading adrenaline from having almost choked to death. \u201cThis is good!\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk with your mouth full, you\u2019re so gross,\u201d Bakugou wrinkles his nose. Deku\u2019s big, stupid smile is infectious, so Bakugou turns his attention to the 7-Eleven bag on the ground instead. \u201cWere you raised in a barn? Hand me some of that soda.\u201d\nDeku hands him the soda. It\u2019s Coke, which Bakugou will accept even though he prefers Pepsi. \u201cDid you really make this, Kacchan? For me?\u201d\n\u201cYes, buttface. Your\u2014who was he? The Harvey Dent knockoff\u2014 insulted our pizza, so I obviously decided to show him what for.\u201d He takes a swig directly from the bottle. Deku observes him, eyebrows furrowed a little as Bakugou wipes his mouth with the back of his hand.\n\u201cWho, you mean Shouto? My roommate?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, him.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Huh. When did you meet him?\u201d Deku asks. His cheeks puff up like a hamster when he eats, and Bakugou pokes his face on impulse. \u201cAh, no, your fingers are greasy!\u201d\n\u201cToo fucking bad,\u201d Bakugou wipes his hand on Deku\u2019s sleeve anyway, earning a very loud whine in response. \u201cHe got pizza once when you weren\u2019t here. Didn\u2019t even tip me, the asshole.\u201d\n\u201cTo be fair, you don\u2019t usually deserve a tip,\u201d Deku says. Bakugou pinches him, but only slightly. \u201cThough like I said, he\u2019s not my boyfriend, he\u2019s just a friend of mine from high school. I don\u2019t have one. Uhm. A boyfriend, I mean. I\u2019m, like. Available. You know. If you were wondering.\u201d\nBakugou was wondering, actually. Deku\u2019s studying his dinner pretty intently. Without that bright green gaze boring into him, Bakugou feels free to grin. \u201cYou\u2019re fucking weird, dude.\u201d\n\u201cWhat! Why am I weird? You\u2019re the one eating a customer\u2019s pizza right in front of his apartment!\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re just rolling with it,\u201d Bakugou says. He leans back against the short wall behind them. It\u2019s solid and immovable, and he bumps Deku\u2019s shoulder as he settles into a comfortable position. \u201cI get a customer complaint literally every day, and yet here we are. Eating pizza at each other in the corridor like a couple of idiots.\u201d\nDeku appears to consider this. He\u2019s chewing a lot slower now, head canted a little like he\u2019s thinking very hard. \u201cI guess it is pretty weird.\u201d\n\u201cSo why, then? I know you\u2019re not in this for the pizza.\u201d He turns his head slightly to watch Deku out of the corner of his eye. The boy\u2019s pretty fidgety, wiggling his feet, seemingly unable to sit still for too long.\n\u201cI dunno, really. I guess it just made sense, \u2018cause you\u2019re pretty weird too. I\u2019ve been told I keep weird company.\u201d\nHe\u2019s not lying, if Half-and-Half is any indication. \u201cI\u2019m not weird. I\u2019m a fucking model citizen.\u201d\n\u201cMm, yeah, and I\u2019m a superhero. I have super-strength and everything, wanna see?\u201d\nBakugou pinches him again, this time on the wrist. Deku wriggles and complains, but doesn\u2019t actually try to escape. \u201cGuess I don\u2019t blame you. I\u2019m god damned delightful, so it\u2019s pretty understandable that you\u2019d try to spend as much time with me as possible.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not wrong about that,\u201d Deku turn to him and smiles. It\u2019s frankly disarming, and Bakugou, for reasons he can\u2019t discern, can\u2019t look away. \u201cGuess you\u2019ve figured out my ulterior motives, huh?\u201d\nSomething squeezes his palm, and Bakugou looks down. Sneaky bastard\u2019s managed to lace their fingers together when Bakugou wasn\u2019t looking, and he jerks back in surprise. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n\u201cKeeping you captive so my pizza\u2019s safe?\u201d\nBakugou makes an odd noise. It\u2019s caught in his throat, halfway between a choke and a laugh, and he bats Deku\u2019s smaller hand away so he can smack him on the shoulder instead. His palm tingles from the discovery that Deku\u2019s got a weird number of callouses. \u201cYou\u2019re ridiculous. I should have known not to trust you, pervert. I\u2019m leaving.\u201d\nDeku pouts at him theatrically, and Bakugou resists the urge to pinch his lips together with the tips of his fingers. \u201cWhat, already? I was having fun.\u201d\n\u201cBelieve it or not, I do actually need to get back to work at some point,\u201d Bakugou says and stands. \u201cI\u2019ve already been out here for half an hour, my boss is gonna kick my ass if I\u2019m not there to make the next order.\u201d\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Deku sighs. He sounds genuinely rueful, and Bakugou tries not to look too pleased at that. Groaning like an eighty-year-old, he wobbles to his feet and scoops what\u2019s left of their dinner up in both hands. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll see you next week or something?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe. You better not give any of that to your gross roommate, I made that shit for you.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not gross, but I won\u2019t give it to him,\u201d Deku says with an impish grin. \u201cI\u2019m selfish, y'know.\u201d\nAnd, well. Bakugou can\u2019t really not smile at that.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou should bang him,\u201d says Kirishima, and you know what, Bakugou was so close to not having a meltdown at work today. So close.\nHe stops cleaning the counter and turns around. Very slowly, maybe to give Kirishima some time to really think about what he\u2019s saying, maybe to give him time to scuttle back into the depths of the kitchen from whence he came and maybe leave Bakugou the fuck alone. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d\nKirishima doesn\u2019t get the hint. \u201cI\u2019m talking about the guy who always gets delivery. You won\u2019t let anyone else take his orders, so you should bang him.\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t sputter. He would, normally, except it\u2019s actually taking quite a lot of concentration to figure out how the fuck Kirishima went from point A to point B. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n\u201cYeah! I mean, like, you know where he lives, and stuff, and it\u2019s pretty obvious he wants to see you.\u201d He leans forward a little over the sink so his head is just poking out from the little window between the kitchen and the front. Nobody\u2019s here except Aizawa, who\u2019s probably napping in the manager\u2019s office. Business is slow, for a Friday night. Slower than usual, anyway. \u201cNot that I can tell why. You\u2019re literally the worst delivery guy on the planet.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m a fucking amazing delivery guy. How about I deliver my fist into your face? 30 seconds or less, or the next one\u2019s free.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely not the pizza,\u201d Kirishima continues, ignoring him completely. Rude fucker. \u201cI mean, Aizawa was right. I\u2019ve tried our pizza. Nobody with tastebuds is gonna wanna eat our pizza a second time, not unless they\u2019re desperate.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one making it, dipshit,\u201d Bakugou says. \u201cGod. I keep saying I should handle the cooking around here, but does Aizawa listen? No.\u201d\n\u201cNobody wants you in the restaurant, that\u2019s why,\u201d Kirishima says. \u201cBut the regular likes you. Sounds like a catch, man, you should date him while you have the chance.\u201d\n\u201cHow would you know he\u2019s a catch? You\u2019ve never even seen him. For all you know, he\u2019s a creepy middle-aged dude with a hundred cats.\u201d\n\u201cIf he\u2019s willing to put up with you, he\u2019s probably an angel.\u201d\nBakugou tosses an elderly bit of pizza crust at him. It goes sailing over his head and onto the floor somewhere, but Kirishima makes no move to pick it up. \u201cYou saying he\u2019s too good for me, punk?\u201d\n\u201cSatan would be too good for you, which is why you should date the regular. Or at least bang him, or something.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not doing it just \u2018cause you tell me to. Also, fuck you, I\u2019m the most eligible bachelor in this joint.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not saying much.\u201d Kirishima ducks out of the window and reappears in the front of the restaurant so he can lounge on one of the barstools. He\u2019s not wearing his apron, seeing as neither of them have actually done anything today. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\u201cNothing\u2019s the matter. Deku\u2019s a loser, and he\u2019s not too good for me.\u201d\n\u201cHis name\u2019s Deku? That\u2019s weird.\u201d\n\u201cHis name\u2019s Midoriya Izuku, but Deku suits him better,\u201d Bakugou replies. Hands on his hips, he surveys their surroundings. Spotless. \u201cBecause, like I said, he\u2019s a loser. Whatever sexual tension you\u2019re seeing here isn\u2019t real.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I never brought up sexual tension,\u201d Kirishima points out. Seems smug about it too, the bastard.\nBakugou huffs. \u201cWell, so what? He\u2019s kinda cute, in a dorky way. What\u2019s the big deal? Lots of people are cute.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but not lots of people are simultaneously cute, available, and interested in the likes of you.\u201d\n\u201cFucking rude.\u201d\nKirishima hums noncommittally and leans his chin against his palm. His expression is thoughtful, for once, a little like Deku\u2019s is sometimes when he thinks Bakugou\u2019s not paying attention. \u201cWell, I guess it\u2019s too much to expect.\u201d\n\u201cThe fuck is that supposed to mean?\u201d\n\u201cDunno,\u201d Kirishima shrugs. \u201cNot even you\u2019d shoot that far out of your league, huh?\u201d\nBakugou stares at him. \u201cDo you think I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n\u201cMhm, really. So you\u2019re not trying to goad me into wooing the fucking regular? You\u2019re not trying to bruise my pride so I\u2019ll get angry and ask him out? Is that what you\u2019re saying, Kirishima?\u201d\n\u201cNope, not at all. Yes? I dunno. Whichever one means I\u2019m agreeing with you.\u201d\n\u201cI see. And you\u2019re not giving me that fucking look, which I can see, by the way, you\u2019re not sneaky, because you think you\u2019re gonna succeed in manipulating me into your bullshit? You don\u2019t think you\u2019re winning?\u201d\nKirishima smiles at him beatifically. \u201cNow, we all know I\u2019m not smart enough for that.\u201d\n\u201cDamn straight,\u201d Bakugou snaps, throwing his cleaning rag at Kirishima\u2019s face. \u201cNow get that dumb fucking smirk off your ugly mug, I\u2019m gonna go make Deku a pizza and then I\u2019m gonna go give it to him.\u201d Turning on his heel, he ignores Kirishima\u2019s sniggering and stalks off to the kitchen, slamming the door extra hard before he gets to work.\nHe karate-chops Kirishima on the back of the head once he\u2019s done for good measure. And then he changes his shirt, gets on his scooter and heads to Deku\u2019s ramshackle apartment building.\nAfraid? Fuck that shit. Bakugou is Baku-gone. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThat door. That same mouldy door with the crumbling paint and cheap wood, and it makes the same awful noise when Bakugou pounds his fist on it. He probably should have called. There\u2019s no way of knowing if Deku\u2019s even home, or if he\u2019s got someone over, or if he\u2019ll be happy to see Bakugou on his doorstep with a pizza in one hand and a nothing but a sweaty palm on the other. Is he appropriately dressed? Does he smell like pizza? Should he have gone home to make himself pretty first?\nCicadas sing at him somewhere in the night. A part of him, the small part that he\u2019s been silencing ever since he was four years old, wonders what he\u2019s going to do if Deku turns him away.\nAnd then he promptly squashes that thought with the heel of his left foot, because haha, nope. Bakugou Katsuki does not get nervous. I don\u2019t care how much you like him, digest those butterflies. \nThe door opens.Bakugou opens his mouth to say something, and then deflates.\nIt\u2019s just stupid Not-Deku. Lame.\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember ordering a delivery,\u201d Half-and-Half says. Mismatched eyes take in the pizza box and Bakugou\u2019s slightly disheveled appearance, and then he glances back up to raise a perfectly-shaped eyebrow. \u201cI don\u2019t remember inviting you, either. Why are you here?\u201d\nBakugou ignores him. \u201cIs Deku home?\u201d\nHalf-and-Half continues staring. His gaze is cool and impassive, and sweat prickles on the back of Bakugou\u2019s neck. For a second he actually thinks it might be a good idea to leave. \u201cWhat are you planning?\u201d\nBut he stands his ground. \u201cIt\u2019s a pizza, not a bomb. I\u2019m not gonna steal him away from you, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re worried about.\u201d\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t if you tried,\u201d Not-Deku snorts at him. It\u2019s a soft, elegant sound, and it\u2019s also incredibly irritating. Thankfully, though, he seems to find whatever answer he\u2019s looking for, and he breaks off the staring contest to finally holler out over his shoulder. \u201cIzuku?\u201d\nA voice responds from somewhere inside. \u201cHmm?\u201d\n\u201cThe angry dandelion is here to see you.\u201d\nFeeling very generous, Bakugou decides not to give him a black eye. \u201cThanks, candy cane.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Half-and-Half swings the door wide open and shoulders past him, sighing like he\u2019s being put-upon. \u201cI\u2019m going to Iida\u2019s. Don\u2019t make a mess.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t come back,\u201d Bakugou retorts, but is distracted halfway by Deku\u2019s face at the door. He\u2019s all flustered and his mop of curly hair is a little windswept, which makes no sense because it\u2019s not like there\u2019s much of a breeze inside the apartment. \u201cI\u2019m not here just to spite Kirishima,\u201d he says, and then winces. \u201cUh. I mean. Hey.\u201d\n\u201cHey!\u201d Deku says brightly. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you. Did I buttdial you or something? I\u2019m sorry, I swear I\u2019ll pay you, let me just get my wallet\u2014\u201d\nBakugou cuts him off. \u201cYou didn\u2019t order a pizza.\u201d\n\u201cOkay?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s on the house. I made it.\u201d\n\u201cOh. I\u2026okay?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna eat it.\u201d\n\u201cWe are?\u201d\nBakugou feels like he\u2019s talking to a slow and remarkably sticky toddler. \u201cYes. It is a romantic dinner that I made for you and me. And then we\u2019re gonna try dating, which will also involve you and me. Do you need instructions? Should I write this down?\u201d\n\u201cOh. Oh. I, no, I mean,\u201d Deku flaps his hands around uselessly for a second. \u201cNo to the instructions. Yes to the dinner. Definitely yes to the dating. Yes. Yes, okay, cool.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Bakugou repeats. \u201cCool. Okay.\u201d\nA tiny smile starts to bloom on Midoriya\u2019s face. It\u2019s a fucking stupid smile, all freckly and soft and shit. Bakugou kinda wants to punch it. Gently. With, like, his mouth. \u201cWould you like to come inside? I still have soda left over from last time, if you want.\u201d\nBakugou wants. It\u2019s a little scary how much he wants, actually, but then again he\u2019s always been the kind of person to take whatever catches his fancy. And right now, illuminated by the light of his apartment and drowning in a shirt at least three sizes too big, Deku is quite definitely catching his fancy.\nHe steps inside.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe cicadas shut up, Half-and-Half leaves them alone, and Bakugou\u2019s worn out sneakers, as it turns out, look pretty good sitting by the door next to a pair of bright red Air Jordans.\nThe pizza is, predictably, fucking delicious.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(A little less delicious is kissing a guy who\u2019s just eaten half a pizza, but Bakugou\u2019s pretty tough. He figures he can deal with it just fine.)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0"
