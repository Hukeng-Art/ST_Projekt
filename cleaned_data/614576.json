But of course, Stiles's twin gets bit and now he's part of Derek's pack, and Derek doesn't snap at him like he snaps at Stiles, never slams him into things, fucking FIGURES, STILES'S TWIN GETS EVERYTHIIIIIIIING.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kalpurna/good ideas OTP.</p>",

    "text": "After Brad was bitten, Stiles couldn\u2019t stop himself from having a bit of a tantrum. \nHe wasn\u2019t a monster. He waited until his twin had gotten out of the ER and everyone had gone home safely. Then he went out to the woods with Scott and Allison, and Stiles had a hissy fit. \n\u201cIt\u2019s okay to be scared for your brother,\u201d Allison said comfortingly. \u201cYou know as well as anyone how awful it can all seem. \u201d\n\u201cScared,\u201d Stiles said, kicking rocks. \u201cI\u2019m not scared for him. He\u2019ll probably be awesome at this too. He\u2019s not even going to need training, he\u2019ll just naturally make wolfing out seem cool.\u201d\n\u201cProbably,\u201d Scott agreed, and then winced when Allison hit him \u201cWhat? He\u2019s right, Brad is good at everything.\u201d\nStiles sent a rock flying at a tree and then fell backwards in a startled pile of limbs when Derek kicked it back. \n\u201cWhat are you all talking about?\u201d Derek demanded, staring at Stiles. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\u201cFirst of all, ow,\u201d Stiles said, shaking himself off. \u201cSecond, something might have happened but we already dealt with it, so chill out.\u201d\n\u201cYour family was threatened, and you want me to \u2018chill out\u2019?\u201d Derek said, his eyes flashing red.\n\u201cThe other alpha said he was sorry,\u201d Scott said, \u201cHe just got caught up in the moment. He\u2019s already fled the state.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles said. \u201cHe thought Brad was an Abercrombie &amp; Fitch model. Since we\u2019re identical twins, do you think I get confused for a model too?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Derek said. Stiles made an indignant noise. \u201cI want to talk to him before the next full moon.\u201d He turned on his heel and melted back into the woods.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still not in your pack,\u201d Stiles yelled after him, but there was no answer. \n*\nStiles wasn\u2019t entirely positive that Brad\u2019s new werewolf muscles even really made a difference to his lacrosse game. Brad was sort of insanely good anyway, so it was hard to tell. \n\u201cGood game, right?\u201d he said, dropping down next to Stiles on the bench. \n\u201cYeah, it looked like it,\u201d Stiles said, not without a touch of bitterness. \u201cHow close are you to breaking the record now?\u201d\n\u201cTwo goals away,\u201d Brad said, ducking his head, like he was embarrassed by this, one of his seriously ten million accomplishments. \n\u201cAwesome, dude,\u201d Scott said, sincerely grinning at Brad. \nBrad dug his knuckles into Stiles\u2019s head in a noogie. \u201cWe should go out sometime and practice. You could be up there with us if you tried.\u201d\n\u201cDoubtful,\u201d Stiles said, scowling. They picked up their bags and headed towards the locker room. \u201cBy the way, Derek wants to talk to you.\u201d \n\u201cWho is Derek?\u201d Brad said with a sharp glance.\nStiles and Scott exchanged helpless glances. \u201cIt\u2019s super hard to explain,\u201d Scott said, hesitating. \u201cHe\u2019s a werewolf too.\u201d\n\u201cBut not a nice one,\u201d Stiles added, and then thought about it for a minute. \u201cBut he\u2019s gotten nicer.\" \n\u201cSometimes,\u201d Scott said. \u201cSometimes he\u2019s all, \u2018we\u2019re brothers, and we have to look out for each other, Scott.\u2019 Then, ten minutes later, he\u2019s all \u201cI\u2019m going to chase you through a parking garage and make you drop your milk, and then be a total dick about it.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cAnd he lives in a subway car,\u201d Stiles said.\n\u201cThis guy sounds like an asshole,\u201d Brad said, flexing in the mirror. \n\u201cStop doing that, it freaks me out,\u201d Stiles said, annoyed. \u201cHe is an asshole, that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. He\u2019s probably going to yell mean things at you, and push you around and---why, what, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m your older brother. You\u2019re supposed to come to me if you\u2019re being bullied,\u201d Brad said, hands on his hips. He looked at Stiles, betrayed. \n\u201cYou\u2019re older by six minutes!\u201d Stiles scoffed. \n\u201cScott,\u201d Brad said, turning to glare, \u201cis he bullying Stiles?\u201d\nScott thought about it. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard to tell with Derek? Even his affection is pretty intimidating.\u201d\nBrad shook his head and pulled on his clothes. \u201cLet\u2019s get this over with.\u201d\n*\nOf course, Brad got on with the pack. Of course. Derek, perhaps learning from his mistakes with Scott, didn\u2019t get really fucking intense when they walked into the train station\u2013 he didn\u2019t yell, or shove Brad into a wall. He just shook Brad\u2019s hand, answered a few questions, asked a few of his own, showed him where they kept the full moon manacles and backed off.\nBoyd, Erica and Isaac knew Brad from school and kept their distance at first, but Stiles honestly didn\u2019t believe there were people who could dislike Brad. Sure enough, in no time, they were all talking and laughing, probably fucking bonding or whatever it is wolves do. \nAll of a sudden, Stiles was pissed. It wasn\u2019t Brad\u2019s fault that he was bitten, no one gave Brad the choice, but Peter Hale had made Stiles decide, and it was the right choice, he knew it was. It still got him hot and angry in his gut, that he\u2019d had to make that call, that he\u2019d had to make so many shitty, hard, decisions, that he had to fight for every inch of respect he\u2019d ever won. \nHe was quietly seething and that\u2019s when Derek slipped into the train seat next to him, and by virtue of proximity, became the target for Stiles\u2019s rage. \n\u201cAll this, this doesn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d Stiles said. \u201cYou get that, right?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Derek said shortly. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re making nice, and that\u2019s great and all, but this doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s joining your pack.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe you should let him make that decision,\u201d Derek said, balling his fists on his thigh.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles said, turning to face him. \u201cLook, I know we split the favorable genes in the pool 70/30, I know he\u2019s...him,\u201d and he gestured at the way Isaac was laughing (laughing!) at something Brad was saying, \u201cbut he\u2019s still my twin brother. We\u2019re a package freaking deal.\u201d\n\u201cI get it,\u201d Derek said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you do, or--\u201d Stiles said, but Derek stopped him with a hand pressed against his chest.\n\u201cI get it, Stiles.\u201d\nStiles exhales. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said. Derek left his hand there a beat too long before removing it to stand up and walk away. \nStiles was still sulking when they finally made it home, but Brad was upbeat and chattering about the meeting. \u201cDerek wasn\u2019t nearly as terrible as you described,\u201d Brad said, as they pulled into the driveway. \n\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles said. \u201cI guess it\u2019s just me who gets him all mad.\u201d \nBrad hummed thoughtfully. \u201cMaybe,\u201d he said, dubiously. \u201cHe didn\u2019t smell that mad when he was talking to you.\u201d\n\u201cI still find that incredibly off-putting,\u201d Stiles told him, and meant it. Whatever privacy he had left after sharing a room for seventeen years was now going to decimated further by sharing it with a werewolf. He buried the thought as too horrible to consider and quietly unlocked the door. They crept into the house, tiptoeing past the kitchen. \n\u201cBoys,\u201d their dad called. \n\u201cFuck. Busted.\u201d Stiles whispered, turning to Brad with wide eyes.\n\u201cWhere were you guys?\u201d his dad said, coming around the corner to lean against the doorframe.\n\u201cNowhere,\u201d Stiles said, trying to keep the defensive tone out of his voice. \u201cWith Scott.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re covered in mud,\u201d he said. \u201cYou must have been doing something.\u201d\n\u201cWe were outside,\u201d Stiles said. \u201cMrs. McCall needed us to garden.\u201d\n\u201cYou gardened,\u201d their dad said, flatly. He turned to Brad, fixing him with a stare. \u201cAt night.\u201d \nBrad was usually the first to cave, confessing all of their misdeeds when Stiles could have held out for ages. \u201cIt was too hot earlier,\u201d he said uncomfortably. \u201cI couldn\u2019t find my sunglasses, so we waited.\u201d\nThey watched as their dad seemed to deflate, looking tired and a little sad. \u201cFine,\u201d he said. \u201cJust go upstairs.\u201d He turned and headed down the hall toward his bedroom.\n\u201cThat was awful,\u201d Brad said when they were alone. \u201cDoes it get easier? The lying?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles said, unhappily. \u201cNot really.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s weird being on this side,\u201d Brad said. \u201cHearing you do it, but not to me this time.\u201d \nStiles felt a little sick. Brad had been incredibly cool about finding out just how much Stiles had been lying to him for two years. They had never really kept secrets from each other before, but Stiles couldn\u2019t - wouldn\u2019t - involve him until the choice had been taken from him. \n\u201cSorry,\u201d he said, inadequately. Brad waved him off, and Stiles thanked every possible deity that he was constitutionally incapable of holding a grudge. \n*\nOf course, Brad did end up joining Derek's pack. \nStiles came home from school a few days before the next full moon and found Scott already there, deep in conversation with Brad. \"Hey,\" he said, shifting his backpack strap over his shoulder uncertainly. \"I would have just driven you if I knew you were coming over.\"\n\"I just needed to talk to Brad for a minute,\" Scott said, fidgeting in the way that Stiles knew meant nothing good. \n\"Wolf crap,\" Brad said, ruefully, like he just wanted to bond over how weird everything was. Stiles kind of wanted to kick him, but instead he went upstairs, slammed open the door to their room, and slung himself sideways into his computer chair. \n\"Ssh,\" Derek said, irritated. \nStiles's heart stopped beating for a second, and then went into overdrive. \"What the hell are you doing,\" he hissed. \nDerek made a gesture that Stiles interpreted from past occasions as threatening his vocal cords. He opened his mouth anyway, prepared to shout the house down, when Derek moved faster than Stiles could react and snatched Stiles up out of the chair and back against his chest. His hand clamped down over Stiles's mouth and Stiles fought the childish urge to lick him. \n\"Quiet,\" Derek breathed into the shell of Stiles's ear. \"Brad's talking to Scott about joining the pack.\" They were both silent for a minute, and Stiles felt the heat of Derek up against his body, the edge of his belt digging into the small of Stiles's back. He was trying to stay stiff, trying not to lean into it, but there was nothing he could do about the way his heart was racing out of his chest. He could only hope that Derek would chalk it up to adrenaline. \"He wants to give it a chance,\" Derek said, and Stiles could hear the relief in his tone. \"He\u2019s gonna try if Scott will.\"\n\"Scott won't,\" Stiles managed, muffled by Derek's fingers. \nDerek tightened his grip and hissed, \"He agreed. They're coming to talk to me tomorrow.\"\nA moment later, Scott called up the stairs, \"I gotta go. See you, Stiles!\" The door slammed shut behind him, and he heard Brad flip on the TV.\nStiles hit Derek's arm sharply, and Derek let go, backing up a few steps. \"It's happening,\" Derek said, low and intense. \"You said you and Brad, you were a package deal, so--\"\n\"Don't fucking rub it in my face,\" Stiles hissed, and he could taste the acid in the back of his throat. \"Don't, just--get out.\"\nDerek looked almost hurt for a second before his face went blank. \"I didn't--\"\n\"Just get out,\" Stiles said, no longer trying to be quiet, and he balled up his fists at his sides. \"Just stay away from me.\"\nThe sound of the TV stopped abruptly, and Derek looked sharply toward the stairs, then turned and slipped out of the window. Stiles threw himself sideways onto his bed, listening as Brad took the stairs two at a time, paused in the doorway and sniffed. \"Was Derek here?\"\n\"No,\" Stiles said, voice muffled by the pillow he was trying to drown himself in. \nBrad didn\u2019t say anything else, and Stiles heard him leave, only to return a little later to leave something on the nightstand. It was hot chocolate, in the mug Stiles had made for their mom when he was little. Brad had made one too, a blue one with different colored polka dots and a perfectly shaped handle. Stiles's was lopsided and dented, with swirls and colors that didn't match or make sense. His mom had sworn that they were both the best things she'd ever seen. \nThe hot chocolate Brad had made was the good stuff too, not even the Swiss Miss packets Stiles was usually lazy enough to reach for.\n\"Thanks Brad,\" Stiles said quietly, and Brad ruffled his hair as he passed. \n*\nStiles avoided everyone the next day at school.\nIt wasn't easy, considering Scott was in almost every one of his classes - a fact that had seemed ideal every day before today - but he managed it. Mostly, he kept his head down, doodling in his notebook, and resolutely ignored the way Scott was trying to catch his eye.\nHe never saw much of Brad at school, so that was easy enough. Brad texted him though, halfway through last period. \"You coming with us to Derek\u2019s?\" \n\"Detention,\" he texted back, grateful to be doing this over text, where his heartbeat couldn't be detected. \n\"OK,\" was the reply. \"Meet us later.\" \nStiles hung back when the bell rang, letting everyone leave before he ventured out. He still almost got caught, rounding the corner to see Brad and Scott slipping into Derek's car. Derek had his dumb sunglasses on, and there was a polite, restrained, almost practiced smile on his face as he greeted Brad \u2013 a smile Stiles had never once seen before. Derek didn't waste his time faking polite with him, apparently. Stiles just rolled his eyes as he watched them leave. \nThat night, when Brad snuck in through the window, tumbling into bed, he whispered, \"You still awake?\u201d\n\"No,\" Stiles said, pulling the covers over his head.\n\"Did you cover me with Dad?\" \n\"What do you think?\" Stiles said peeking his head out to give him a level look. \n\"Thanks, Stiles,\" Brad said sincerely, and reached out with his pinky extended towards Stiles. Stiles thought about ignoring him, thought about blowing it off, but caved without much resistance, looping his finger around Brad's in the handshake they\u2019d invented when they were six. \n\"You should have come over,\" Brad said, rolling away, satisfied. \"Derek asked where you were.\"\n\"Wasn't in the mood to sit and twiddle my thumbs,\" Stiles said, trying to hold onto his irritation in the face of Brad's openness. He imagined that's exactly how it would have gone: him watching Scott, Brad and the rest reaffirm how super awesome and badass they were, on their own little team. \n\"You know I wouldn't steal him, even if I could,\" Brad said carefully. \"You know that, right?\"\nStiles huffed. \"Scott's given me too much blackmail material over the years to abandon me now,\" he said.\n\"Yeah,\" Brad said in a weird tone. \"Scott. That's what I meant.\"\n\u201cDude, I know,\u201d Stiles said, looking over at Brad, \u201cthat\u2019s what I just said. Did you take too many head shots in werewolf boot camp tonight?\u201d\nBrad just rolled his eyes, toeing off his shoes and pulling up the covers. \u201c\u2019night, Stiles.\u201d\nStiles shook his head and sighed. \u201c\u2019night, Brad.\u201d\n*\nThe next morning was Saturday, and neither of them got out of bed until almost noon. Stiles had no idea why his father let it happen - normally he was purposefully clomping down the hall outside their room by ten at the latest. \nStiles stretched in his sheets, curling his toes deep into the fabric, enjoying the stretch of his muscles. \n\"Who are you going to prom with?\" Brad asked from the other bed. \nStiles stopped stretching to look at him. He was flat on his back, arms crossed under his head, gazing contentedly at the ceiling. \"How on earth is that your first question after waking up?\"\n\"I've been up for three hours,\" Brad said, unperturbed. \"I was meditating.\"\n'Ugh,\" Stiles said and pushed the heels of his hands into his eyeballs. \n\"Answer the question,\" Brad demanded. He swung his legs out of bed, and shoved him over until Stiles let him in next to him. \"Stiles. Stiles. Stiiiiiiles. I'll call you by your real name if you don't tell--\"\n\"No one,\" Stiles said, giving in. \"God, we can't all be you.\"\n\"What does that mean?\" Brad said, offended. His shoulder knocked against Stiles's. \n\"You know what I mean, you damn hussy,\" Stiles said, but his voice lacked any bite. \"How many people in our class have you slept with now?\"\n\"I think it's tacky to count,\" Brad said primly. \"They're all special in their way.\"\n\"Hate you,\" Stiles groaned, covering his face again. \n\"You could find someone too,\" Brad said earnestly. \"It would be so easy, you just gotta let go a little. If you would just stop all the pining--\"\n\"Dude, I said I was over Lydia!\" Stiles said, sitting up. Brad sat up too, and scrubbed his hand across his face. He moved the hand to Stiles\u2019s shoulder, leaned forward and had opened his mouth to speak when he stopped, cocking his head to the right. Stiles was just about to comment on how much he looked like the neighbor's dog when Derek slid the window open. \n\"You heard me coming,\" Derek said, a twinge of approval in his voice. \u201dGood.\u201d He took in the scene, and said, \"what\u2019s going on?\"\nStiles opened his mouth to answer, but Brad cut across him. \"We're talking about getting Stiles laid.\"\nDerek froze, eyes darting between them like Brad was kidding. Stiles punched Brad in the arm but only hurt his own knuckles. Brad just laughed at him. \"C'mon Derek, help me out here. He could grow his hair out a little--\"\n\"What, like your gross bird's nest?\" Stiles squawked, hitting him again.\n\"It's called tousled bedhead,\" Brad said loftily. \"Anyway, we're not talking about me. We're talking about putting you in clothes that fit and setting you loose on the world.\" He was looking at Derek with a challenge in his eyes, daring him to--something. Probably daring him not to laugh, Stiles thought. \n\"This is stupid,\" Derek said. \"Let's go.\"\n\"Not today,\" Brad said. \"I'm hanging out with my brother.\"\n\"Brad,\" Derek said stiffly. \"I'm not asking.\"\n\"Neither am I,\" Brad said. \"I'm spending today with Stiles.\" Stiles's hand still hurt where he had punched Brad's stupid werewolf muscles, but he was still pleased enough to dig his toes affectionately into Brad\u2019s calf where it was sprawled across the bed. \nDerek stood there another moment, looking awkward. Brad rolled his eyes and elaborated. \"So I can only go if Stiles comes.\"\n\"Stiles has yet to want to come anywhere with the pack,\" Derek said. \n\"Stiles,\" Stiles said, emphasizing his name, \"thinks it's rude when you talk about him like he's not here. Also, when have you ever asked me to do anything?\"\nDerek stared at him. \"Every time,\" he said flatly. \"You were supposed to come with Scott, and then with Brad, but I had to hear--\"\n\"Got it,\" Stiles said grumpily. \"I'm allowed as the plus one.\" He shoved off the bed and made towards his dresser. \"Where are we going?\"\n\"He never tells us,\" Brad said, too cheerfully. \"Better wear something you can run in, maybe spandex.\"\nStiles flipped him off and headed off to shower. He heard Derek growl at Brad before he turned the water on. Dude needed to lighten up.\n*\nDerek's secret destination was a clearing two towns over that was bordered on one side by a jagged cliff. \n\"First one to reach the top gets to keep what's up there,\" Derek said lazily, as they all climbed out of the cars. \n\"What are we, twelve?\" Jackson said, grumpily. \"I thought this was going to be a serious training.\"\n\"It is,\" Derek said. \"Climbing is a serious skill. So is learning better hiding places for the embarrassing shit you idiots keep under your mattresses.\"\nThere was a beat of silence, and then a cloud of dust nearly rose up in their mad dash to get to the top and protect their secrets. \nStiles sprawled out in the grass to wait for them to get back. \u201cWhat\u2019s really up there?\u201d \n\u201cA ten dollar Starbucks gift card,\u201d Derek said, dropping down next to him. Stiles snorted out a laugh and laced his hands under his head, staring at the clouds. It was a nice afternoon, and Stiles was still kind of sleepy, so he was content for a bit to just lie there, basking. \nApparently their personalities were switched today, because Derek was a goddamn Chatty Cathy. \u201cWhat Brad was saying this morning--\u201dhe bit off the rest of the sentence with a clack of his teeth. \n\u201cNo worries dude,\u201d Stiles said, turning his head to look at him. \u201cI\u2019ve had seventeen years to learn the lesson that I can\u2019t do everything Brad does, no matter what he says. Plus, finding someone he hasn\u2019t already slept with is like finding a needle in a haystack.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that you can\u2019t,\u201d Derek said, and he was glaring straight ahead at an old stump of a tree. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t. Your first time, you should be with someone you know, someone who would make it good.\u201d\nThe lazy sleepiness of the afternoon dissipated in a second, replaced by electricity in the air and licking up and down Stiles\u2019s spine. \u201cWhat,\u201d he said, and his voice was unsteady. \u201cWait, are you offering.?\u201d He tried to make it come out like a joke, like something they could both come back from, but he couldn\u2019t.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Derek said, and finally turned his gaze on Stiles as the air was sucked completely out of his lungs. \nThere was a cry of outrage from the cliffs above him as the pack discovered the total lack of blackmail material at the top. He heard them screaming insults at Derek even as they climbed down, ten times faster than they had gone up. Derek\u2019s intense stare wavered as they got closer and closer, and he eventually broke eye contact, standing to meet them. \nStiles closed his eyes and played dead until his heartbeat was under control. \nDerek didn\u2019t so much as look at him for the rest of the day. It might have been because the pack was dogged about getting their revenge on him, but the implication seemed to be that it was Stiles\u2019s move. \nThe only problem was that Stiles had no idea what Stiles\u2019s move was going to be. He trudged after the pack down the path to the car, lost deep in thought.\nUp until the age of about seven, Stiles and Brad had been inseparable. They were full-on creepy similar about everything, to the point where even their own mom had trouble telling them apart if they concentrated on fooling her. \nThen she had gotten sick, and their dad\u2019s eyes had gotten less bright, and things had gotten hard. And in the middle of all of this, Lydia Martin had invited Brad to her birthday party and not Stiles. \n\"I won't go without you,\" Brad had said fiercely, lying next to Stiles in the big double bed in Deputy Clarke\u2019s guest room while their dad spent yet another night at the hospital. \"I'll tell Lydia tomorrow.\" Stiles hadn\u2019t said anything, just rolled away and tried to fall asleep. \nThe next day at recess, Lydia had come over, all perfect curls and smiles, with an invitation for Stiles too. He'd taken it, stammering his thanks, and Brad had practically bounced home, positive everything had been solved. Stiles had stuffed the invitation in the bottom of his bag, and left it there. \nHe didn't remember much about the actual party, just all the lead up and then that it was there that he\u2019d met Scott, his first friend that was completely separate from Brad, who didn't even really care about Brad, who never liked Brad better. He wasn't sure he'd ever met anyone else that's been true for.\nStiles climbed into the Jeep, and slammed the door. On the other hand, it was an offer for no strings sex with a hot guy who, under all his douchebaggery, Stiles knew was a good person. He was pretty sure this was the outcome Brad was looking for with all his plans for taking Stiles out clubbing. He was pretty sure that if he asked his opinion, Brad would call him an idiot if he turned Derek down.\n*\nThey made it back to Beacon Hills just before five. Stiles sat patiently through dinner, waited until his father was happily ensconced in front of the television and then yelled, hoodie in one hand and a backpack of hastily packed supplies in the other, \"I'm sleeping over Scott's!\"\nHe barely waited for a reply before he was vaulting over the front steps and into the Jeep.\nStiles didn\u2019t bother texting Derek before he started driving. He was under no delusions that Derek wouldn't hear him coming in more than enough time to do something about it if he had been kidding. Still, his heart lurched in his chest as he approached the train depot and Derek was leaning against the wall outside. His eyes gleamed in the dim light of the setting sun, and Stiles's hands were shaking as he shut off the engine. Derek shoved off the wall and moved towards him, opening the Jeep's door for him. Stiles swallowed and unbuckled his seatbelt, and slid out, hefting his backpack over his shoulder. \n\"You're nervous,\" Derek said, closing the door behind him.\n\"You can smell that?\" Stiles asked. \n\"No,\" Derek said, wryly. \"But it's fifty degrees out tonight and you're sweaty.\"\n\"Sorry,\" Stiles said, embarrassment rising up in the back of his throat. \"I didn't know it was against the--\"\n\"It isn't,\" Derek said. \"Only, we don't have to, if you don't want.\" He looked determined, like he needed Stiles to understand that, first. \nStiles rolled his eyes. \"If you've already changed your mind then--\" but Derek cut him off again, which \u2013 rude. He would complain about it, but Derek was suddenly in his space, backing him up against the driver's side door of the Jeep until his back hit it with a dull thud. Derek's hands were around his jaw, cupping his face, tilting him enough to get better access to his mouth. \nIt wasn't Stiles's first kiss, wasn't even his first kiss with a guy, but it was definitely the first kiss that made him short circuit. Derek kissed him like he was starved for it, like he'd been waiting for it. When Derek finally drew back, Stiles had sagged all of his weight back on the Jeep, was about as capable of holding himself up as a jello jiggler. \n\"I didn't,\" Derek said, and his voice was weak, like he was startled too. \"I didn't change my mind.\"\n\"Then we're on the same page,\" Stiles said, and he was proud of getting the words out so clearly. Derek looked at him for a minute, and then leaned right back in, resting his forearms against the glass of the window, caging Stiles in to kiss him again. \nIt was a long time before they surfaced again. The door handle was sharp and digging into Stiles\u2019s spine and his ass was cold where it was pushed against the metal, even through his jeans. The wind cut straight through his hoodie, and the parts of him that weren\u2019t currently touching Derek pebbled with gooseflesh. The parts that were \u2013 the skin of his neck under Derek\u2019s hands, his thighs where Derek was wedged between them, were overheated and sweaty. He desperately needed to crack his neck, to lick his lips, to unclench his fingers where they were bunched in the fabric of Derek\u2019s shirt. \n\u201cWe could go inside,\u201d Stiles mumbled into Derek\u2019s mouth, but it was still another minute before Derek backed up enough to lead him in. Stiles stumbled after him, down the steps and through the unlit hallway to the train car. \n\u201cIs Isaac here?\u201d Stiles asked, brain finally rebooting enough to function. \n\u201cNo,\u201d Derek said. \u201cI told him to go out with Scott tonight.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t know for sure I was coming,\u201d Stiles said, licking away the dryness on his lips. \nDerek tracked his motion. \u201cI\u2019m an optimist.\u201d\n\u201cNo you\u2019re not,\u201d Stiles scoffed, and was prepared to back up his argument with properly cited sources when Derek grabbed his wrist and tugged, making him stumble forward into the train car. A mattress with a ton of pillows was crammed in a corner of the car; the sheets looked crisp, like they were recently washed, which Stiles appreciated. Made the whole thing less grim. \nDerek was looking at him when Stiles finally dragged his eyes away from the mattress. His face was set, like he was preparing for Stiles to run away screaming. Optimist, his ass. \nStiles flung himself sideways onto the bed, hitting the mound of pillows with a bounce. He wiggled a little, getting comfortable. \u201cNice,\u201d he commented, and he raised his hand over his head to grab the back of his shirt and pulled it off. \nDerek\u2019s eyes darkened, zeroing in on his chest. Stiles seriously hoped he wasn\u2019t going to stand there all day. He\u2019d been hard since he\u2019d left his house, and it was starting to ache. It didn\u2019t look like Derek was much better off, the bulge clearly visible in his jeans. Still, Derek wasn\u2019t moving, just looming, staring. \u201cDerek,\u201d Stiles said, raw and uncertain; and finally, finally, Derek moved.\nHis hands were like brands on Stiles\u2019s skin. He\u2019d look to see if there were visible handprints where Derek was touching him, but they were kissing again, and Stiles had his priorities. Derek was touching him everywhere, hands roaming up his shoulders, to his neck, down his back, hot and tight just under his ribs. Stiles squirmed until he got one of his legs free, so he could plant his foot on the mattress, knees spread wide enough for Derek to settle between. \n\u201cOff,\u201d he said hoarsely, and shoved at Derek\u2019s shirt until Derek stopped kissing him long enough to strip it off. The moment he was free of the sleeves, he was diving back down, mouth drawn like a magnet to Stiles\u2019s own. Stiles couldn\u2019t do anything but let him, too distracted by the breadth of Derek\u2019s back, the warmth of his skin, the way Derek shuddered when Stiles scratched his nails down Derek\u2019s spine. \nThey took a long time getting further. Stiles was shoving his hips up into Derek\u2019s, mindlessly searching for friction before it occurred to him that he could do something about the situation. He\u2019d mock his own stupidity, but honestly, he couldn\u2019t help but forgive himself, considering the situation. He magnanimously went for Derek\u2019s belt first, stripping it open and scrabbling at the button of his jeans. Derek made a low, hoarse noise in his ear, and Stiles wanted nothing more than to hear that again. He got his hand in there, wrapping around Derek and pulling him out while Derek panted, hot and heavy in his ear. He got a few good, enthusiastic strokes in before Derek was twisting out of his grip, backing up and away, to Stiles\u2019s horror. But Derek only moved to kick off his jeans completely, shucking his underwear off at the same time. Then he was reaching for Stiles again, and Stiles helped him unbutton his pants and they went flying somewhere over Derek\u2019s shoulder. \n\u201cHow far do you want to go tonight?\u201d It was the first thing either of them had said in a while, and Stiles startled at first, not expecting the question. Derek was sitting back on his haunches, between Stiles\u2019s knees, and Stiles knew if he said it, Derek would be content just to kiss him through mutual handjobs.\n\u201cWhen have I ever thought small?\u201d Stiles said, and spread his knees farther apart. \nDerek let out a harsh breath, and his hands came up to clutch hard around Stiles\u2019s too-warm thighs. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d he asked urgently.\n\u201cCan we just stamp yes on the proceedings until you\u2019re told otherwise?\u201d Stiles said, trying for a reassuring smile. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m shy. Also, there\u2019s, ah, lube and condoms in my backpack.\u201d\n\u201cYou brought your own?\u201d Derek smirked at him. \u201cHow polite.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to presume anything,\u201d Stiles shot back. \u201cI\u2019ve seen how well-thought-out your plans are.\u201d\nIn retaliation, Derek bit the inside of Stiles\u2019s thigh, just a little nip, raising a mark on his skin. It didn\u2019t really work well as punishment, and Stiles whimpered, reaching down to grab his dick and squeeze. \n\u201cFuck,\u201d Derek said, voice throaty and face flushed. He reached for Stiles\u2019s bag and dug around in it, quirking an eye at Stiles when he dumped out two full bottles of Wet and a strip of about ten condoms. \nStiles shrugged. There was no excuse for not being prepared, he felt. Derek was back between his legs, but crouched lower this time, sliding a pillow under Stiles\u2019s hips. His breath was hot, and Stiles shivered as he felt it coast over his cock. Derek noticed, and did it again on purpose, eyes on Stiles, and Stiles huffed out a laugh at him. \u201cTease,\u201d he accused.\nDerek smiled, sharp like a shark, and faster than Stiles could brace himself for it, bent his head to suck Stiles completely into his mouth. \nStiles bucked up with a shout, and Derek\u2019s fingers bit into his hips to hold him still. \u201cChrist,\u201d Stiles said, shakily, relaxing into Derek\u2019s grip. Derek bobbed his head down once, twice, and pulled off with a slick pop. \u201cHas anyone ever done this for you?\u201d\n\u201cTons of times,\u201d Stiles said, and Derek\u2019s eyes darkened. Stiles hoped his heart was already skipping around like a schoolgirl at recess so much that Derek wouldn\u2019t detect the lie, but he wasn\u2019t going to put money on it. \nSuddenly, he heard the clicking sound of Derek opening the lube, (lube tube, tube of lube Stiles sang crazily to himself to keep from tensing up or coming \u2013 both were honestly real possibilities) and then a finger, slick and cold, was pressing against his hole. \nEven as he told himself not to, Stiles stiffened, feeling every nerve in his body orient down towards that finger. Derek felt it, he had to, and leaned up to take Stiles in his mouth again. \nStiles groaned, and tried desperately to keep still, to keep from shoving up into Derek\u2019s throat. When Derek\u2019s finger started moving again, Stiles was better able to relax against it, distracted and too turned on to do anything else. \nDerek took his time opening Stiles up, keeping Stiles on the edge of orgasm with his mouth and fingers for what felt like forever. In the end, Stiles was begging for it, shamelessly and without restraint, tossing his head back and forth on the bed and calling Derek\u2019s name, pleading. \nDerek didn\u2019t move until Stiles felt well and truly mad, just making drawn-out noises that weren\u2019t anywhere near words. Only then did he rear up, sliding a condom down over his dick, and pushed in. \nIt was honestly the weirdest feeling of Stiles\u2019s entire life. He couldn\u2019t categorize it as either good or bad, just strange. He was forcing himself to breathe, to hold still, to let Derek push until his hips were flush against Stiles\u2019s ass. \n\u201cStiles,\u201d Derek said \u2013 gasped, really. He was covered in sweat, braced over Stiles, eyes wider than Stiles had ever seen them. He couldn\u2019t help but crane his neck up until Derek got the point and met him in a kiss that was hardly coherent, a kiss that was interrupted again and again by their panting breaths. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d Derek asked, reaching a shaking hand up to touch his jaw. \n\u201cYes,\u201d Stiles strained, and he shifted around until Derek dropped his hands to grab at Stiles\u2019s thighs, spreading him open and up for little pushes that turned into longer thrusts, when Stiles started moving with him. It was good now, better, the ache from the beginning more distant and in the background. Derek was groaning, little punched out noises that seemed to come deep in his chest with each thrust, and Stiles just couldn\u2019t stop thinking how Derek was in him, and people did this every day. \nDerek shuddered and bucked before too long, clutching Stiles a little too tight as he shoved himself as close as he could get to Stiles and came. \n\u201cDerek,\u201d Stiles pleaded, so close, so fucking close and Derek swore, pulling out and sliding down again to suck him back into his mouth. This time, Derek kept his hands off Stiles\u2019s hips, let him shove up as much as he wanted, unresisting as he worked him towards orgasm. When Stiles finally came, it was like his entire body locked up, like all his strings were pulled too tight, like everything in him exploded and when he came back down he was wrung out and destroyed. \nWhen he opened his eyes again, Derek looked smug, licking his lips in a way that made Stiles groan. \u201cGo away,\u201d he said weakly, flapping his hand. Derek laughed and rolled away to dispose of the condom. \n\u201cI\u2019m going to take a shower,\u201d Derek said, grabbing a towel off the floor. \n\u201cWhere the hell is there a shower?\u201d Stiles grumbled. \u201cYou live in a train depot.\u201d Derek didn\u2019t answer him, and Stiles was starting to feel gross, the drying sweat, lube and body fluids on him not exactly a pleasant feeling. He didn\u2019t know if he was expected to follow Derek, to get in the shower with him, or whether fuckbuddy etiquette dictated that you just got the next turn. Without Derek\u2019s body heat, the train car was kind of cold, and there wasn\u2019t a blanket on the bed. Derek ran too hot to need one, normally, he surmised. \nDerek\u2019s phone vibrated next to him, and Stiles didn\u2019t even feel guilty about reaching for it and flicking it open. It was a text from Isaac that just said can i please come back now. \nyes, Stiles typed back, suddenly embarrassed. He didn\u2019t want to shower with Derek, didn\u2019t want to lie there, cold and naked on this weird nest-bed, and he certainly didn\u2019t want to sexile Isaac any longer than he had to. \nSo he shoved his clothes back on, grabbed his bag and left. It was a long, miserable ride home. He felt young and dumb, and a little ashamed. Brad would have known what to do with Derek, afterwards. Brad would have said something, done something that would have made it all less weird. Brad wouldn\u2019t have run for the hills like an awkward virgin. But Derek had known he was an awkward virgin, and hadn\u2019t really given him a clue on what came next, once you weren\u2019t a virgin anymore and awkward was all that was left.\nThe tree outside his window was much harder to scale than the werewolves in his life made it seem, but he didn\u2019t tumble to his death at any point, so he counted it as a success. The window was unlocked as usual and he slid it open, revealing an empty bedroom. He breathed a sigh of relief, hightailing it to the bathroom to scrub his body until his skin fell off. \nWhen he finally came out of the shower, having doused himself in bodywash a zillion times, Brad was home, sitting cross-legged on his bed, laptop open in front of him. \n\u201cHey man,\u201d Stiles said casually, crossing the room to his own bed. \n\u201cHey,\u201d Brad said, sniffing suspiciously as Stiles passed him. \u201cI thought you were sleeping at Scott\u2019s?\u201d\n\u201cChanged my mind,\u201d Stiles said, pulling down his covers to slide in, avoiding Brad\u2019s gaze. \n\u201cDid you get in a fight with Scott?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Brad said. \u201cBecause I saw him and Allison at Katie Zavig\u2019s party tonight, so you must have changed your mind about seeing him completely.\u201d\nStiles felt sore and his skin didn\u2019t feel quite right on his body. He could still feel phantom touches, and there were things that had to be thought about, scoured over before he could finally abandon himself to sleep. Talking about it with Brad was pretty much one of the last things he wanted to do, and he wanted even less to have to summon the energy to lie his brother, the walking lie detector. \n\u201cGo tell Dad if you want,\u201d he said rudely and turned his back on the room. There was a sharp inhale from Brad\u2019s side and then quiet. A few moments passed, and then the lights flicked out and there was silence. \nStiles dug his nails into his palm and wished he was a better person. \n*\nThe next morning was stilted and awkward. Brad ducked around him as they got ready, avoiding his eyes, and the more guilty Stiles felt, the more surly he got. By the time they left for school, Stiles was in an impressively foul mood \u2013 one that even Scott sensed when Stiles screeched to a stop outside his house. It was a dead silent ride. \nSchool was better, in that Stiles had more distraction, less time to contemplate his life, but then worse again when he saw Isaac, who gave him a look. Stiles didn\u2019t want to read too much into it, but was pretty sure the look said, \u201cI know you skanked it up with Derek last night and I\u2019m judging you.\u201d\nIsaac once told Scott (and then Scott immediately told Stiles under many promises never to repeat it) that his first concert had been a Hannah Montana show. Stiles held that knowledge in the front of his memory, and smirked meanly back. \nHe skipped lacrosse practice, because he was never going to play anyway, and he wasn\u2019t in the mood to face Isaac, Scott, and Brad. Isaac probably would have told Boyd about him and Derek, so count him among the people Stiles was avoiding too. He kicked a rock and headed for the parking lot. God, he was unfit for human consumption right now. \nIt was with that thought that he reached the Jeep and found Derek lurking next to it. \u201cHey,\u201d Stiles said, surprised into a friendly tone. \nDerek scowled. \u201cYou left.\u201d\nStiles rolled his eyes. \u201cWe were done, weren\u2019t we?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Derek said, eyes flashing. \n\u201cThe original offer was for a devirginizing,\u201d Stiles said, opening the door to chuck his stuff in the back. \u201cJob well done. Feel free to use me as a reference.\u201d\nSuddenly there was a hand on the back of his neck, and he was yanked backwards enough for the door to slam shut, and then he was being shoved around until he was in a familiar position: his back against the car, Derek pressed close against his front. \n\u201cI wasn\u2019t done with you,\u201d Derek repeated fiercely. \n\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d Stiles retorted. His mad-for-no-reason mood that had been dogging him all day was in full force now.\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Derek said, and his voice was strained. \u201cYou know everything about sex now? You\u2019ve done it all?\u201d\n\u201cDone enough with you,\u201d Stiles said, and considered stomping on Derek\u2019s foot until he backed up. \nDerek caught it, or enough of it, in his eyes, because he backed off a little, loosening his grip on Stiles\u2019s wrists. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, again. \u201cNot nearly enough.\u201d There was promise in his eyes, a dark look that lit up something in Stiles\u2019s gut. Late last night, Stiles had come to the conclusion that he probably wasn\u2019t cut out for fuckbuddies, that it probably was best left to others. \nBut here, pinned under Derek\u2019s gaze again, he thought, okay then. You\u2019re on. \nIt was far, far more intense, the second time. Derek touched him with intent \u2013 like he was proving something, like he was storming a castle. Point proved, Stiles thought. Achievement unlocked. \nAfterward, he rolled onto his back and exhaled loudly. There was graffiti on the roof of the train car, someone's name in angles and sharp twists he couldn't make out. He stared at it anyway, waiting for his heart rate to go back to normal. \nHe was almost there when two arms slipped under him, one under his knees and one supporting his back, and lifted. \n\"What the hell?\" Stiles said, flailing wildly. \nDerek's grip never loosened and he strode out of the car and through an old door with a faded sign that said Employees Only. It was a break room of sorts, with lockers, a small kitchenette, and in the back, a shower. \n\"Oh brother,\" Stiles said, rolling his eyes. \n\"People who run off don't get to shower alone,\" Derek said, and proceeded to start a very stupid waterfight. \nStiles went home still laughing. \n*\nThe third time was pretty damn good too. \nThe fourth, fifth and sixth times happened in one twenty-four hour period, when Derek convinced him to stay over and kept pinning him every time Stiles tried to get out of bed. \nTo be fair, he hadn\u2019t struggled that hard. Or really, at all. \nBrad didn\u2019t say anything anymore when Stiles rolled in at strange hours or disappeared from the school parking lot, but Stiles knew he was paying attention. \u201cDon\u2019t pick me up from school tomorrow,\u201d he told Derek one night, pulling his jeans back on. \nDerek frowned, eyebrows drawing together in irritation. \u201cI thought you said your dad was working all week.\u201d\n\u201cHe is,\u201d Stiles assured him, hunting for his shirt among the clutter. \u201cYou can pick me up somewhere in town if I can\u2019t get the Jeep.\u201d Derek scowled again, like the explanation wasn\u2019t good enough. \u201cHey, I\u2019m not the genius who bought himself a super distinctive car.\u201d\n\u201cWho cares?\u201d Derek said mulishly, watching him dress. \u201cAlso, I didn\u2019t buy it.\u201d\nStiles stopped, his hoodie dangling from his hand. \u201cYou didn\u2019t?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Derek said, and he rolled his shoulders, cracking his neck. \u201cMy dad had just retired from his job, and bought it for himself as a present. My mom was pissed.\u201d\n\u201cToo expensive?\u201d\n\u201cHe let Laura drive it more than he ever did,\u201d Derek said. \u201cHe taught her to drive on it, and when she got her license, all she had to do was look at him, and he threw her the keys. My mom thought it was a ridiculous car for a sixteen year old.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a ridiculous car for anyone,\u201d Stiles said. \n\u201cShut up,\u201d Derek said, and drew him down into bed again. \nLater, after Stiles had been thoroughly distracted again from leaving, Derek said hesitantly, \u201cYou\u2019d really rather that I pick you up from the side of the road?\u201d\nStiles laughed. \u201cNot really worried about being classy when I\u2019m picked up for my trashy sex marathon in an abandoned train car.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Derek said, and walked him to the car. \n*\n Then there was the night Derek took Stiles on a stakeout.\n\u201cI always wanted to do this,\u201d Stiles said, sinking low in the seat. He was wearing a black long sleeve shirt, black hoodie, black jeans, even a pair of black sneakers, reflector strips blacked out with electrical tape. There was a black ski mask and gloves on the dashboard, just in case. \nDerek looked just like he always did. Granted, that still involved a lot of dark colors, but Derek clearly hadn\u2019t dressed up for the occasion, which Stiles thought lacked some fun. \nLuckily, tonight was a night he seemed willing to be amused. \u201cYou always wanted to stake out someone\u2019s house?\u201d\n\u201cSheriff\u2019s kid,\u201d Stiles reminded him. \u201cMy dad did it occasionally, and it always seemed so awesome.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s mostly boring,\u201d Derek said, looking out the window toward the house where the suspect guy was watching Dancing With The Stars on his living room couch.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what Dad always said,\u201d Stiles said, \u201cbut I never believed him.\u201d His stomach grumbled, and he shifted, embarrassed. He probably should have eaten at some point instead of tearing his room apart finding every piece of black clothing he owned. \nDerek reached for a bag in the backseat and unzipped it, lifting out two sandwiches and a thermos. \n\u201cWhaaaaaat,\u201d Stiles said, mouth hanging open. \n\u201cAre you hungry or not,\u201d Derek said grumpily, passing him one. Stiles hastily took it before Derek changed his mind. He braced his feet on the dashboard, glancing over at Derek as he did, waiting to be reprimanded. Derek didn\u2019t seem to notice though. He seemed almost relaxed, unwrapping his own food and watching the house, so Stiles balanced the sandwich on his knees, cutting into the plastic wrap with his nails. \nIt was good. He chomped through it happily and nudged Derek\u2019s arm until Derek turned to look at him. \u201cWhat\u2019s in the thermos?\u201d he asked, mouth obnoxiously full. \nDerek\u2019s mouth twisted with something like fondness. \u201cHot cocoa,\u201d he said gruffly. \n\u201cFuck, seriously?\u201d Stiles said, excited. \u201cI love hot cocoa.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Derek said, staring out over the lawn again. \u201cBrad told me once.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Stiles said, and tried not to be too pleased by that. \nThey passed the thermos back and forth, watching this random house, in the middle of a completely boring subdivision. Derek refused to actually answer when Stiles asked what they were watching the house for, so Stiles started making up a story about the guy who lived there, and what he\u2019d sold his soul for. \n\u201cI\u2019m gonna go take a leak,\u201d Derek said, about twenty minutes in. \nStiles, thrown, stopped with his intricately detailed story. \u201cWhat, in the woods?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m going to break into that old lady\u2019s house and use her bathroom.\u201d Derek rolled his eyes. \n\u201cDon\u2019t act like you wouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d Stiles said darkly. \u201cYou\u2019d totally do that.\u201d\n\u201cOnly to you,\u201d Derek said, and slipped noiselessly out of the car. \nDerek\u2019s phone chimed while he was gone, and Stiles checked it. The message was from Erica, who said how\u2019s the date going?\nStiles passed Derek his phone when he climbed back in. \u201cCover story for your absence tonight?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cMmm,\u201d Derek said. \u201cCheck the bags in the backseat, I think there\u2019s chips in one of them.\u201d\nStiles wasn\u2019t hungry yet, but that kind of behavior deserved rewards. \u201cHey, wanna fool around?\u201d\nDerek shot him a look. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be watching the house.\u201d\n\u201cBetter keep watching, then,\u201d Stiles said, sounding more confident than he felt. He moved slowly, so Derek could push him off if he really wanted, but he didn\u2019t \u2013 he barely seemed to be breathing as Stiles thumbed open his jeans and tugged the zipper down. \n\u201cStiles,\u201d Derek groaned, half protest, half pleading. \n\u201cEyes on the suspect,\u201d Stiles said and bent his head to take him in. \nIt was his first time giving head, much less giving head in a car. Derek\u2019s thighs were tense under him, and his breath was coming faster now, harsh and panting. Stiles hadn\u2019t even really started yet and he could feel Derek working himself up. It was pretty good for his previously basement-level self-confidence. \n\u201cYou still watching?\u201d he said, pulling off for a moment. \n\u201cYes,\u201d Derek hissed, and Stiles smirked, working him a few times with his hand before taking him back into his mouth, hollowing his cheeks around him. \nEnthusiasm was probably his best strategy here, and he played to it shamelessly, bobbing his head in the best rhythm he could muster. Every time Derek had done this to him, Stiles had been putty after \u2013 just wrecked \u2013 and he wanted desperately to do the same to Derek. Derek\u2019s hand was warm on the back of his neck, and Stiles was lost in it, his world narrowed to the feel of Derek \u2013 in his mouth, on his skin, under his hands. He used just a tiny bit of teeth, just barely scraped up Derek\u2019s cock and Derek shouted, rocking up enough to choke Stiles, shooting down his throat.\nStiles pulled off, coughing a little, and Derek reached for him immediately, pulling him bodily across Derek\u2019s lap until Stiles was straddling his hips. \u201cSorry,\u201d he was muttering. \u201cSorry, sorry, sorry,\u201d but his hands were busy at Stiles\u2019s waist, yanking his jeans open. \nHe paused when he got them open. \u201cYou even wore black boxers,\u201d he said incredulously. \n\u201cI am committed to stealth,\u201d Stiles gasped, rocking his hips insistently. \u201cAlso, priorities!\u201d\nDerek shook his head, but he got his hands on Stiles, so that was okay. It was an embarrassingly quick hand job, but how could it not be? He was only human, and it turned out that giving head made him rock hard. He didn\u2019t know if he should feel weird about that or not, but Derek was licking his fingers clean of Stiles\u2019s come, so it was pretty hard to concentrate on anything.\n\u201cYou stopped watching,\u201d Stiles said sleepily, slumped into his own seat again. \n\u201cSorry,\u201d Derek said. \u201cI got distracted.\u201d He started the car, even though the supposed suspect was still meandering around the house, in a robe and bunny slippers. \n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Stiles said. \u201cDon\u2019t let it happen again.\u201d\n\u00a0\n*\n\u201cYou were out late again last night,\u201d Brad said, casually perching on the end of his bed. \nStiles was sitting at his desk, chewing on a pen cap while he tried his best to murder Scott\u2019s avatar on screen. \u201cHm?\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to get my head bitten off again,\u201d Brad said cautiously. \u201cOnly, the last time you were sneaking around late at night, I got turned into a werewolf.\u201d\nStiles winced, typed a brief message to Scott and swivelled the chair around. \u201cI\u2019m still sorry about that,\u201d he said.\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Brad said. \u201cYou had nothing to do with it. Tell me what\u2019s going on with you.\u201d\nBrad was leaning forward, elbows on his knees, broadcasting \u201cyou have my undivided attention.\u201d Stiles caved like a house of cards. \n\u201cRemember that thing you said the other day, about getting over myself, and letting things happen?\u201d Stiles raised his eyebrows and gave him a significant look. \n\u201cNo fucking way,\u201d Brad said, and held up his hand for a high five. Stiles slapped his palm, feeling equally stupid but satisfied that he could do this now, that he wasn\u2019t eternally stuck at the kids\u2019 table. \u201cDetails,\u201d Brad demanded. \u201cWho? When? Where? Not how, though. Let\u2019s be real, no one needs that amount of detail.\u201d\nStiles rolled his eyes at him. \u201cI dunno. It\u2019s not that big of a thing, I guess. It\u2019s just this guy. It\u2019s not going to turn into anything. I\u2019m not even a hundred percent on whether he even likes me that much.\u201d\n\u201cDude,\u201d Brad said, managing to cram a whole lot of judgment into such a short word. \n\u201cIt\u2019s so good though,\u201d Stiles argued. Brad looked tempted by this as an argument so Stiles pressed on. \u201cIt\u2019s honestly just sex. No one\u2019s gonna get invested.\u201d\n\u201cYou get invested in the Puppy Bowl,\u201d Brad said, but he got up like the conversation was done. Stiles breathed a silent sigh of relief and turned back to his computer game, and Brad went back to organizing his loafers, or whatever he was doing. \nFive minutes later, Derek tapped on the window. \u201cYou get it,\u201d Brad said, voice muffled from where his head was buried in the closet. \n\u201cYou get it,\u201d Stiles said defensively. \u201cHe\u2019s your alpha. He\u2019s probably here for you.\u201d\nBrad laughed. \u201cLike he\u2019s ever here for me.\u201d\nDerek, impatient, opened the window from the outside. \u201cIf you two idiots are done,\u201d he said pointedly. \u201cWe have a problem.\u201d \n*\nThe problem turned out to be weird shit in the woods. Big surprise. The pack was gathered around markings that made absolutely no sense. Stiles didn\u2019t have their heightened sense of smell, and even he knew that the footprints \u2013 wide, with too many toes, improbably shaped \u2013 weren\u2019t normal. \n\u201cThis isn\u2019t right,\u201d Stiles said, and his skin crawled suddenly. \u201cThere\u2019s something fishy about this.\u201d\nThe words were barely out of his mouth when a woman stepped out from behind the trees and said, \u201cSo your pack does have a member with a brain, Derek Hale.\u201d \nDerek had just time enough to growl before she reached out, curled a hand around his wrist and they both disappeared.\nThere was chaos for a second, as six werewolves all charged the same empty spot at the same time. There was screaming, cursing, and ringing for some reason and it took a minute for Stiles to realize that last one was only in his ears. He stared mindlessly for a moment at the space where Derek was last standing, with only the thought, what. \n\u201cStiles,\u201d Allison was shaking him. \u201cStiles, listen to me.\u201d He looked up at her, numb with shock. \u201cI know who that was. Listen to me, I know who that was. \nThe commotion stopped as abruptly as it started, and five half-shifted werewolves turned glowing yellow eyes on Allison. She swallowed. \u201cThat was Lisa Regan. She\u2014she was friends with my aunt.\u201d Stiles inhaled, as he grasped what that meant, what she might want with Derek. But Allison wasn\u2019t done. \u201cStiles, she\u2019s a witch, but she\u2019s also a hunter, a really scary one. Even Gerard was scared of her.\u201d\n\u201cHow do we get him back?\u201d Boyd asked, voice low and furious. \n\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d she said, back straightening with resolve. \u201cOnly Stiles and I can.\u201d\nFor a moment there was total fucking pandemonium again. Everyone was shouting Allison down, and she was shaking her head stubbornly, firing right back. \nStiles put two fingers in his mouth and whistled as piercingly as he could. The werewolves clapped their hands over their ears immediately, and gave him resentful looks. \u201cWhy us?\u201d he said, attention solely on Allison. \n\u201cBecause she won\u2019t deal with werewolves. She hates them. We have a chance, a slim chance, if we go as humans, and explain that Derek isn\u2019t evil.\u201d \nStiles nodded. \u201cThen we need a plan.\u201d\n*\nHe had shaved his head for the first time when his mom was sick. Before that, he and Brad had found it absolutely hilarious to pretend to be each other. They fooled their dad with ease, their mom when they concentrated, had even done it to all of their friends at one time or another. \nThe game had stopped being funny when their mom\u2019s eyesight started to go. She genuinely couldn\u2019t tell them apart any longer and would cry, begging their forgiveness. It had been so hard for everyone, their dad had started to talk about limiting visits, or stopping them all together.\n\u201cShave it,\u201d Stiles had said, handing the electric razor to his brother, sitting on the side of the bathtub. Brad\u2019s eyes had been wide and frightened, but he had done it, and they hadn\u2019t acknowledged the tears in both their eyes. \nNow, five years later, their positions were reversed. \n\u201cJust do it,\u201d Brad said, gritting his teeth. \n\u201cGod, shut up,\u201d Stiles said. He wracked his brain one last time for another way, another plan, but they had gone in circles for as long as they could before hitting on this. It was the only way. \nWith a steady hand, he shaved the first stripe, and Brad\u2019s hair began to flutter down to the floor. \nWhen it was done, they stood side by side in front of the mirror. Brad reached up, scrubbing his hand over what was left of his hair and let out a shaky laugh. \nStiles clapped him on the shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna love the upkeep.\u201d He twisted to avoid the punch aimed at his shoulder, and threw Brad some clothes, an exact copy of the outfit he himself was wearing. \n\u201cUgh,\u201d Brad groaned. \u201cInsult upon injury.\u201d But he shrugged them all on, the t-shirt under the flannel under the hoodie, with crappy jeans to match. \n\u201cHey, I was wondering if you guys wanted--\u201d Their dad stood in the hallway in his uniform, mouth hanging wide open.\n\u201cHeeeey dad,\u201d Stiles said. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely going to clean up all the hair, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re worried about.\u201d\n\u201cNo, not exactly.\u201d He leaned against the doorframe, arms folded. \u201cWhat is going on here?\u201d\n\u201cWould you believe Brad here was jealous of my sweet style?\u201d Stiles said. \n\u201cNot in a million years.\u201d \nStiles opened his mouth to try another story when Brad cut him off. \u201cI wanted to, Dad,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cStiles and I have been hanging out a lot lately, and it made me remember how it used to be.\u201d\nStiles looked over at him, nonplussed. He hadn\u2019t known Brad felt that way.\nTheir dad coughed. \u201cYou kids used to confuse me all the time,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cGetting me to call you the wrong name was--\u201d\n\u201cTen points,\u201d Stiles said, laughing a little. \u201cIf you were yelling at us, it was twenty-five.\u201d\n\u201cWe kept track in a little notebook,\u201d Brad said. \u201cA running tally.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, your mom found it,\u201d he said. \u201cShe used to lord it over me how many more points I had than she did.\u201d He reached out and rubbed his knuckles over both of their shaved heads. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you guys this close in years. I like it.\u201d\n\u201cMe too,\u201d Brad said, and Stiles didn\u2019t have to be a werewolf to know he wasn\u2019t lying. \n\u201cYou guys gonna be around tomorrow?\u201d their dad said hopefully. \u201cI have to go to the station tonight but maybe tomorrow we could order pizza, have a Stilinski men night?\u201d He smiled at them, looking happier than Stiles had seen him in weeks. \n\u201cDad, we--\u201d Brad started, but Stiles cut him off. \n\u201cYeah, Dad,\u201d he said. \u201cThat sounds really, really nice.\u201d Brad gave him a look but Stiles just shrugged at him. If they didn\u2019t make it through tonight, missing dinner would not be the biggest problem on their list.\nTheir dad slapped them both on the back, and crushed them into a double hug. \n\u201cAll right, all right,\u201d Stiles said, squirming. \u201cLet\u2019s not get carried away. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m letting you get meat on the pizza.\u201d\nHis dad scowled, stepping back. \"We'll talk about that tomorrow.\" He turned to go. \"Whatever you're up to tonight, be home and asleep by midnight. School tomorrow.\"\n\"\u2019kay. 'Night, dad,\" Stiles said quietly, watching him walk away. He and Brad looked at each other. \n\u201cIf there is a tomorrow,\u201d Brad said, and Stiles nodded, squaring his shoulders for the night ahead.\n* \nThe plan went down like this: They had called Lisa Regan and negotiated a meeting, and she had let Derek on the phone for just a moment, to prove he was alive. \n\u201cDon\u2019t come after me,\u201d Derek had growled. It was fortunate that no one ever listened to his orders. \nThe meeting place was an abandoned factory on the north side of town. She had warned them she was surrounding the place with mountain ash, and had. They were there now, standing just outside the line. Lisa stood in the doorway, watching. Clearly and carefully, Allison and Stiles stepped over the line. \nShe nodded approvingly and came forward. She waved something in the air over them, an artifact Stiles didn\u2019t recognize, and everyone tensed. \nShe gave Allison a hard look. \u201cStupid girl,\u201d she said, and expertly extracted two guns from Allison\u2019s belt, a knife from her boot, and two daggers from her sleeves. \n\u201cDon\u2019t know how those got there,\u201d Allison said, her eyes politely downcast, but she flicked them up briefly at Stiles and Stiles winked at her. \n\u201cWell come on,\u201d the hunter witch said, turning her back to go back inside. With a quick gesture, Stiles broke the mountain ash line and ducked sideways behind a car. Lightening quick, Brad took his place beside Allison and handed her another knife that she stowed carefully in her jacket. \nWhen they had disappeared inside the building, Stiles widened the break in the ash line, allowing the rest of the wolves to pace carefully inside and hide with him, waiting for the signal to come in. \nThere were raised voices, mostly between the hunter and Allison. \u201cShe\u2019s not going to give in. Not until Derek\u2019s paid for Kate\u2019s death,\u201d Erica said. Her voice was bitter and harsh, and she was leaning forward to speak into Stiles\u2019s ear, careful not to attract attention. \nHe flushed a little, thinking of Derek and how he had yanked Stiles up against his body that day Brad and Scott had joined the pack, had whispered in Stiles\u2019s ear exactly what was going on. Stiles shivered. \n\u201cSeriously, Stiles, get it together,\u201d Erica hissed, and he felt his face heat up and flipped her off. \nJust then a light flashed through the window, and that was Allison\u2019s signal that they weren\u2019t going to be able to negotiate. They all charged through the doors, but the werewolves weren\u2019t shifting. Scott skidded to a stop, staring at his hands, obviously trying to concentrate. \nStiles stopped just outside the entrance to the factory. Derek was chained in the center of the room, slumped over, his broad back facing Stiles. He sucked in a breath, because there were cuts all over Derek that weren\u2019t healing, like he had been whipped with something. He looked half-dead and barely conscious. \nBubbling with anger, Stiles looked for the witch. Allison was crouched low, ducking spells as they flew at her, keeping Lisa\u2019s attention on her. Scott and Isaac were circling the other way, trying to get behind her, but the woman was too fast. She whirled and aimed a finger at Scott, and something, a spell, black and deadly, shot out of her fingertips, and Scott only just dived out of the way to miss it. When he hit the ground, Stiles heard a sickening crack and Scott cried out, holding his leg. \n\u201cMongrels,\u201d she hissed, advancing. \u201cStupid mangy, dirty, animals,\u201d she spit out, her face an angry mask, and she was raising her hand again. Scott couldn\u2019t heal \u2013 he wasn\u2019t going to have time to move, and a jolt of fear shook through Stiles. She was going to kill him.\n\u201cScott,\u201d he screamed, and darted forward, but in the woman\u2019s fury, she had forgotten Allison. In a flash, Allison had the hidden knife in her hands, and she buried it between the witch\u2019s shoulder blades. \n\u201cAllison,\u201d Scott cried, urgent and scared. \nAllison raised her head and looked at him, her eyes huge and haunted. \u201cShe was going to hurt you,\u201d she said simply, her voice ragged. Moments later, she was in Scott\u2019s arms, and Stiles turned away to give them a moment. \nDerek was still in chains, but he was rousing, head beginning to lift from where it had sagged on his chest. Brad was leaning over him, struggling with the chains, trying to break the locks. \nStiles made his way over to help, but he\u2019d only gone a few steps when there was a click, and Derek was free. He flexed his wrists, stretched and then reached out, and Stiles watched as he swept Brad close to his chest and kissed him, hard. \nStiles spun around, reeling, and walked out the door. \nHe was overreacting. He knew he was, he wasn\u2019t completely stupid. Derek hadn\u2019t known, he\u2019d assumed it was Stiles. It was the whole point of the plan, actually. There was no reason to be hurt. \nHe was, though. Acid burned in his gut and he wanted to kick something, anything. Derek should have been able to tell, should have known. He kept seeing it over and over again, Derek holding Brad close, kissing him. Derek always treated Brad better, never acted like a dick or like Brad was exasperating him just for being there. \nHe pulled his hood up over his head and walked home. His feet pounded out his frustration, and he exhaled against the cool night air. It didn\u2019t matter. He didn\u2019t have exclusive rights to Derek. They weren\u2019t dating, they weren\u2019t even friends. The words felt wrong in his head though, and he burned with regret. He had known he wouldn\u2019t be good at screwing around. He had known it, and let himself believe it wasn\u2019t true, that maybe this time he and Brad could both be good at something. \n\u201cStiles,\u201d someone called furiously behind him. \n\u201cLeave me alone, Brad,\u201d Stiles said flatly. \nThere was a hand on his shoulder spinning him around. \u201cYour secret fuckbuddy is Derek?\u201d Brad\u2019s eyes were flashing and furious.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles said, and he was angry, he was so angry. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry about it. Once again, you won. Number one champ, seventeen years running.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Brad said. \n\u201cI\u2019m talking about you. I\u2019m talking about when I tried out for lacrosse, you became first string. I\u2019m talking about how when I go to see my favorite band, you end up invited backstage. I\u2019m talking about fucking werewolves, and how many times I almost died, and you breezed through it.\u201d It was exploding out of him, and he was shaking like a leaf. \u201cAnd I\u2019m talking about how the first time I got something of my own, no matter how stupid or fake it was, I had something with Derek, and you\u2019re the one who got to rescue him, who got the big reunion scene. So I\u2019m telling you, leave me alone, Brad.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t really think that,\u201d Brad said, and he was pale, eyes wide. \u201cThat\u2019s not how it is.\u201d\n\u201cIt really is,\u201d Stiles said, and moved to storm off. \nBrad grabbed his arm, stopping him. \u201cDid you ever stop to think that I was trying to follow you? That you just stopped talking to me, stopped wanting to be around me, you just abandoned me.\u201d Stiles opened his mouth to refute it, to argue but Brad held up his hand. \u201cDid you know that I wasn\u2019t scared when that alpha bit me? Did you realize that the reason I was okay with the pack, with everything was that I thought we\u2019d finally stop having secrets? That you\u2019d be my brother again?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t keep Derek a secret,\u201d Stiles said. \u201cI told you I was seeing someone.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you looked me in the eye and said no one was invested,\u201d Brad said. \u201cYou cannot seriously be that dumb.\u201d \nStiles blinked. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n\u201cDerek\u2019s in love with you, you moron!\u201d Brad yelled. \u201cHe\u2019s been in love with you forever! You cannot mess with him like this!\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles said, shaking his head. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Brad said, with a disturbing amount of conviction. \u201cI\u2019m not wrong, and you have to stop sleeping with him, for his sake.\u201d\n\u201cFor his sake?\u201d Stiles repeated dumbly. \nBrad just looked at him. \u201cYou asked me once how I stay friends with everyone I sleep with. First rule, never fuck someone who feels something for you that you don\u2019t feel for them.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re nuts,\u201d Stiles said weakly, but the bitter jealousy had gone out of him, replaced by pure shock. \nBrad scoffed. \u201cWhen have I ever been wrong?\u201d he said. \nFucking Brad, Stiles thought to himself. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I stopped being around,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I never told you what was wrong.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Brad said, already losing the tension out of his shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you felt sidelined. I had no idea you did.\u201d\nThey trudged back to the house in silence. He could feel Brad looking over at him a few times, but he wasn\u2019t ready to talk, couldn\u2019t think. He needed time. \nBut of course, when they got back to the house, Derek was right there, sitting on the steps. Brad gave Stiles a significant look, and then went inside, closing the door behind him. \nStiles dropped to sit on the stairs next to Derek. \n\u201cI didn\u2019t know it was Brad,\u201d Derek said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have kissed him, I didn\u2019t--I was powerless, I couldn\u2019t smell him\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Stiles said, and he felt tired, like he\u2019d been put through more tonight than he ever has. \u201cWe\u2019re not together, you\u2019re allowed to kiss whoever you want.\u201d\nDerek hunched his shoulders, forward. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said, but he sounded miserable. \nStiles couldn\u2019t hold it in. \u201cBrad says you\u2019re in love with me.\u201d\nStiles turned to watch Derek\u2019s face and it was frozen, like that hadn\u2019t been in his script for the conversation. There was silence for a solid minute. Then Derek\u2019s jaw twitched, and he gritted his teeth before saying simply, \u201cyes.\u201d\nStiles exhaled loudly. He still hadn\u2019t believed it when Brad had said it, but here it was, from the source. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that.\u201d\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to,\u201d Derek said, staring at their feet on the bottom step. \u201cI didn\u2019t--I knew you didn\u2019t feel like that.\u201d\nStiles nodded. \u201cBrad told me I needed to stop this,\u201d and he waved a hand between them. \u201cHe said it wasn\u2019t fair.\u201d\n\u201cDo you want to stop?\u201d Derek said hoarsely. \n\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles said, stripped down to bare honesty. \u201cI don\u2019t. But we can\u2019t be fuckbuddies anymore, not now that I know, not anymore.\u201d\n\u201cSo date me,\u201d Derek said. The words sounded ripped out of him, like he was saying them before he could stop himself. It didn\u2019t make it all any less ridiculous. \n\u201cWhat?\u201d Stiles said, incredulously, already shaking his head in disbelief. \nDerek moved, grabbing his arm and pulling him up to face him. His hands came up to clamp on Stiles\u2019s shoulders, holding him tight. \u201cDate,\u201d he repeated. \u201cNot just fucking. We\u2019ll go out, I\u2019ll fucking buy you food, you can talk for two hours about the ending of a movie I\u2019ve never seen, I\u2019ll talk to your dad.\u201d\n\u201cYou want to talk to my dad?\u201d Stiles said, and his voice was high and incredulous. \n\u201cNot even a little bit,\u201d Derek said. \u201cBut I will anyway.\u201d\nStiles\u2019s mouth was hanging open, and Derek took advantage of it and kissed him. It was unfair negotiating techniques, because any arguments Stiles had went right out the window, even before they were formed. Derek\u2019s mouth was insistent, laying claim to Stiles, and his hand was hot as it skimmed along Stiles\u2019s shoulder and curled around the back of his neck. \n\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d Derek said, when they broke apart. \u201cLet me try.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Stiles said, leaning his forehead against Derek\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d \nHe heard Brad cheer from upstairs. \u201cShut up, Brad,\u201d they yelled in unison, and Stiles laughed, and kissed him again. \nEpilogue\n\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d Stiles said, munching on the leftover kernels of his popcorn. \u201cHow were you surprised by that? I saw that coming like ten minutes into the movie.\u201d \n\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re a giant fucking nerd and read all the comics at age four,\u201d Derek said and slapped the bag of popcorn into a nearby trash. \n\u201cHey,\u201d Stiles yelped. \u201cI wasn\u2019t done with that.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t bring outside food into a restaurant,\u201d Derek said. \u201cWhat, were you raised by wolves?\u201d\n\u201cOh, Arby\u2019s is a restaurant now,\u201d Stiles said. \u201cLet me go get my coattails.\u201d\nThey got their food and slapped it down at a table, still bickering when Brad and Erica slid into the seats across from them. \n\u201cGo away,\u201d Derek said immediately. \n\u201cWait,\u201d Stiles said practically. \u201cIs anyone dead or dying?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Erica said.\n\u201cThen go away,\u201d Stiles said, grinning. \nErica rolled her eyes. \u201cNo one wants to crash your weird date, losers.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not weird,\u201d Derek said. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly normal and by the book.\u201d\n\u201cHe held my hand and everything,\u201d Stiles said cheerfully. \nBrad pretended to gag himself. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving so quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cTrust me. We just wanted to tell you that we\u2019re together now.\u201d\nStiles choked. \u201cYou\u2019re what now?\u201d\n\u201cI thought you were dating Boyd,\u201d Derek said, confused. \n\u201cI am,\u201d Erica said, pleased. \n\u201cAs am I,\u201d Brad said. \nStiles let his head drop to Derek\u2019s shoulder. \u201cPlease tell me my brother isn\u2019t in a threesome relationship with all my friends.\u201d\n\u201cNot all your friends,\u201d Brad said. \u201cWe\u2019re totally not dating Isaac.\u201d\n\u201cOr Scott,\u201d Erica said.\n\u201cOr Allison,\u201d Brad agreed.\n\u201cThank God for small favors,\u201d Derek said, sliding an arm around Stiles\u2019s shoulders. \n\u201cListen,\u201d Erica said. \u201cNot everyone wants your weirdo backwards relationship.\u201d\n\u201cHand-holding,\u201d Derek repeated dangerously. Stiles patted his thigh comfortingly. Derek leaned down and kissed him, slipping his hand up to cup Stiles\u2019s neck. \n\u201cYou\u2019re totally disgusting and I need to go take my lady to pick up my man friend,\u201d Brad said, making a face at them. \n\u201cYeah,\u201d Erica said. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna go do weird stuff in your house. Don\u2019t come home without calling first.\u201d With that, they got the hell out of dodge, snickering and laughing. \n\u201cFigures,\u201d Stiles said, resting his chin in his propped up hands. \n\u201cWhat?\u201d Derek said.\n\u201cI get into a homosexual relationship with a werewolf, and Brad gets in a bisexual polyamorous relationship with two werewolves,\u201d he said mournfully.\n\u201cI\u2019m better, I\u2019m the alpha,\u201d Derek said, deadpan.\n Stiles pulled the wrapper off his straw and balled it up. \n\u201cFlick that at me and you\u2019re gonna pay,\u201d Derek said, warningly. \nStiles flicked it at him without hesitation. Derek retaliated by stealing a handful of curly fries. \u201cDo you really care?\u201d he said, mouth full. \u201cAbout Brad?\u201d\n\u201cNot really,\u201d Stiles said, and he realized it was true \u2013 he wouldn\u2019t trade his life with Brad\u2019s for anything. \u201cI love you.\u201d \nDerek paused mid chew. \u201cAre you joking?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles said, and grinned at him, wide and gleeful. \u201cHow many dates did it take?\u201d\n\u201cThirty-seven,\u201d Derek said, without hesitation. He swallowed his mouthful of food, still staring at Stiles. \u201cDon\u2019t fuck with me, Stiles.\u201d\n\u201cI love you,\u201d Stiles said again, and flicked another wrapper at him. \nDerek dove for him, crowding into the corner of the booth, kissing him frantically. \u201cSay it again,\u201d he demanded. \n\u201cI love you,\u201d Stiles said, and let himself be pulled into Derek\u2019s lap. Derek curled his hands around his back and crushed Stiles to him. \nSomeone coughed loudly, and they both looked up.\nThere was an Arby\u2019s employee standing frozen next to their table, mop forgotten in his hand.\n\u201cI\u2019ll pay you $50 to walk away and leave us alone,\u201d Derek said without loosening his grip. \n\u201cDone,\u201d the guy said. Derek reached into his pocket, pulled out a wad of cash, and threw it on the table. The guy took it and ran. \nBy the time they surfaced, Derek\u2019s hair was a mess from Stiles\u2019s hands and Stiles looked like he\u2019d been hit by a really affectionate truck. \n\u201cBed,\u201d Stiles said. \u201cLike, yesterday.\u201d\n\u201cYours,\u201d Derek said hoarsely. \u201cI don\u2019t want to think about what\u2019s going on in mine.\u201d He grabbed their coats and pulled Stiles out the door. He held Stiles\u2019s hand the whole way home."
