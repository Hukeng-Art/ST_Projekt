    "text": "\u201cCan you repeat that?\u201d Stiles asked weakly, his brain buzzing as he tried to process what he was hearing.\nThe man smiled indulgently at the boy and said again, \u201cI require a favor, and I believe you are the best people to help me. The Nemeton is dying, and with it, Beacon Hills. We need to restore the balance that was present when the once-great Hale pack was guarding the land.\u201d\n\u201cSo you want us to go back in time?\u201d Stiles confirmed at a whisper, hardly daring to speak any louder. He looked to his left at Lydia, who was uncharacteristically quiet. She shook her head at him almost imperceptibly and nodded at the man to continue.\n\u201cYes,\u201d he confirmed. \u201cThe Council and I need you to prevent the downfall of the Hale pack, so that they may survive and help the Nemeton to flourish.\u201d\nStiles rolled his eyes. \u201cOh, is that all?\u201d he asked dryly. \u201cWe just need to go back in time and prevent a massive fire from breaking out in the middle of the preserve that took the lives of more than ten people?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d the man replied unflinchingly. \n\u201cAnd to think I almost didn\u2019t get out of bed when I felt that damn ward go off.\u201d Stiles grumbled. He had been cozy and warm in his blanket burrito just an hour ago when he felt one of his and Lydia\u2019s wards activate in the woods by the high school lacrosse field. He was all set to brush it off as someone else\u2019s problem when his phone rang. And who was he to ignore a call from Lydia?\nOf course the ward hadn\u2019t malfunctioned \u2013 he and Lydia hadn\u2019t spent all summer researching only to put up faulty wards, but he hadn\u2019t expected\u2026 this.\nThey had barely made it out of Stiles\u2019 jeep in the parking lot before they came upon the \u2018threat.\u2019 The man was sitting serenely on the bleachers, looking out over the empty lacrosse field as if he was merely waiting to meet an old friend.\nHe had introduced himself as Kane, spent about ten minutes describing his role on the Wizard\u2019s Council, and then dropped the bomb about time travel on them without giving Stiles or Lydia the chance to so much as sit down.\n\u201cTo my knowledge, time travel has not yet been successful,\u201d Lydia interjected primly. \u201cAre you telling me this has been tested before?\u201d\nKane smiled kindly at her before answering. \u201cYes, my dear. Over the last several hundred years, we have perfected the art of time travel.\u201d\nStiles\u2019 eyes widened. \u201cHow many times have you done it?\u201d\n\u201cTraveled through time?\u201d Kane clarified. After a nod from both Stiles and Lydia, Kane answered. \u201cOnly twice myself, for routine purposes. Never with the intent of changing the past, as you two would.\u201d\nStiles and Lydia exchanged twin frowns. \u201cBut wouldn\u2019t changing the past, especially this drastically, detrimentally effect this world as we know it?\u201d Lydia asked, voicing their shared concern.\n\u201cNot entirely. The universe has a way of balancing things out, as we have learned in our experiments over the years. And while this may seem like a drastic change to you, changing the fate of one family is the universal equivalent of a milk run compared to the situations in which we have had to intercede in the past.\u201d\nLydia opened her mouth to ask what Stiles was sure to be a barrage of questions about these past situations, but he held up a hand to stop her. \u201cWhy us? Why not do it yourselves?\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d said Kane eloquently. If Stiles didn\u2019t know any better, he would have through the man was embarrassed. \u201cWe have attempted to intercede several times. There are simply too many variables at play, and we do not have the intimate knowledge of the situation that you do.\u201d\nLydia cocked her head to the side, letting her not-at-all-sleep-mussed hair fall in a curtain over her shoulder. \u201cVariables?\u201d\nKane nodded. \u201cThe Argents had many back up plans that would have led to the annihilation of the Hale pack, had their first plan not worked out. We have attempted to stop several of them, but it would seem the only way, other than wiping out the Argent family altogether, is to get the Hales to trust us enough to inform them of the threat so they may prepare themselves to fight against it. As of yet, we have been unsuccessful in that arena.\u201d\nStiles licked his lips and chuckled ruefully. \u201cYou may be overestimating how much luck we\u2019d have getting the Hales to trust us. I mean, the Hales we know now barely trust us as it is, and we\u2019ve been through a lot together. How are we supposed to get their whole pack to believe what we\u2019re saying, let alone trust that we\u2019re telling the truth?\u201d\nThere was a sparkle in Kane\u2019s eye as he responded. \u201cI think you\u2019d be surprised how much the Hales trust you already, Stiles. And as far as how you\u2019ll get the others on board \u2013 I\u2019ve known you for twenty minutes and already I trust that your intentions are pure. They will, too.\u201d\nStiles exchanged another look with Lydia, who pursed her lips for several seconds before nodding. \u201cOk,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in. When do we start?\u201d\nRight away, as it turned out. Stiles and Lydia were instructed not to let their pack in on the mission. Kane was concerned that there would be significant opposition to the task. Stiles, however, was more concerned that he wouldn\u2019t be able to prevent Derek, Cora, and Peter from demanding that they come along. And that would be a disaster.\nIn the end, Stiles convinced Kane to let him tell Deaton, so there would be at least one person in the present timeline who knew that he and Lydia were messing with time travel. Lydia insisted that she tell Jackson as well, to whom she had grown closer when he reappeared suddenly from London after he had learned of the Nogitsune\u2019s reign of terror, and Allison\u2019s death.\nThe next night, after Stiles\u2019 dad had left for his shift, Stiles picked up Lydia and Jackson and drove to the Animal Clinic to meet Kane. Kane was already there, just finishing the set up for the big spell. Deaton was perched in the corner with his arms folded. He had already expressed his displeasure at the prospect of Stiles and Lydia time traveling.\n\u201cHow will they get back?\u201d Jackson asked for the third time.\nKane turned his attention to the wolf and answered again patiently. \u201cThey will repeat the incantation I have told them to say. It must be done after nightfall, under a moon that is more than half full.\u201d\nJackson grumbled a bit and began pacing.\n\u201cOk,\u201d declared Kane, stepping back from the circle he had created in the middle of the room. \u201cLydia, you stand here.\u201d He motioned to the middle of the circle, next to a pile of rune stones. \u201cStiles, across from her, here.\u201d He led Stiles to Lydia and stopped him when they were only about a foot apart. \nJackson continued to pace nervously against the wall. He had also objected to Lydia attempting to time travel, but he was beaten down each time he brought it up. Stiles could almost feel the nerves coming off the boy in waves. \n\u201cCheer up, Jacks,\u201d Stiles jeered obnoxiously. \u201cI\u2019ll have her back in no time.\u201d He winked at the wolf as Jackson stopped walking and growled. \n\u201cHe\u2019s right, you know,\u201d agreed Kane. \u201cIt will feel to us as if no time at all has passed. We will only know that the spell was successful if they tell us in just a few seconds.\u201d\nJackson pouted and resumed pacing. It was a testament to how anxious he was that he didn\u2019t retort.\nKane turned his attention back to the two in the circle. \u201cNow I need you to hold hands and not let go.\u201d He waited until Stiles and Lydia had a firm grip on one another before continuing. \u201cYou ready?\u201d After a nod from both of them, Kane began the incantation. His blue eyes turned a violent shade of orange as the spell began to take effect. The last thing Stiles registered before he passed out was someone screaming his name and strong hands catching him before he hit the ground.\nStiles came to on the grass. He felt blindly around himself and all he was met with was cold, hard ground. Opening his eyes slowly, he found himself shielding them from the sun. He heard a groan to his right and sat up immediately.\n\u201cLydia?\u201d Stiles called out quietly. \u201cAre you ok?\u201d\n\u201cNot Lydia. And not ok,\u201d came a decidedly masculine voice. \nThe sound of retching reached Stiles ears as his brain caught up with himself. \u201cJackson? Dammit, what are you doing here?\u201d He looked around wildly. \u201cWhere\u2019s Lydia?\u201d\nJackson wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. \u201cThe spell was only meant for two people, remember?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, so why the hell are you here?\u201d Stiles stood up, fighting against a sudden wave of nausea. He stumbled, and was surprised when he felt a hand steady him. \u201cYou!\u201d he accused, pointing a stern finger at Jackson.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Jackson protested, taking a step back and looking at the hand that was on Stiles\u2019 shoulder as if it had betrayed him. \n\u201cYou caught me, didn\u2019t you? When I fell at the clinic during the spell.\u201d\n\u201cWhen you fainted, you mean,\u201d Jackson mumbled, embarrassed.\nStiles took that as a confirmation. \u201cDid I let go of Lydia?\u201d\nJackson thought back to the moment for a second before nodding. \u201cYeah, right before I caught you.\u201d\n\u201cShit,\u201d Stiles spat. \u201cThe spell must have transferred to you when you touched me. I guess I\u2019m stuck with you,\u201d he muttered to himself.\n\u201cHey!\u201d Jackson protested. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I volunteered for this.\u201d Jackson\u2019s head shot up and turned to his left. He held out a hand for Stiles to be quiet. To his surprise, Stiles fell silent.\nThe two of them stepped to the side, behind a large oak tree. Jackson closed his eyes to focus his hearing while Stiles went against every instinct he had and didn\u2019t speak.\nSeveral minutes passed. Just when Stiles was about to burst, Jackson\u2019s shoulders dropped in relief.\n\u201cWhat was it?\u201d Stiles hissed, keeping his voice low.\nJackson frowned, still looking in the direction of the now-gone voices. \u201cI think it was Derek. It sounded like him, only younger?\u201d\nStiles\u2019 eyes widened. \u201cDoes that mean it worked? Did we really just travel through time?\u201d\n\u201cI think so,\u201d said Jackson, awed. \nStiles moved out from behind the tree to get a better look at their surroundings. \u201cI think we\u2019re in the Preserve.\u201d\nJackson nodded, following Stiles deeper into the woods. He paused to scent the area and pointed off to Stiles\u2019 left. \u201cThe road is that way. Maybe we can find someone who\u2019ll give us a ride into town.\u201d\nStiles snorted. \u201cAnd tell them to take us where? My house, where my dad\u2026\u201d he trailed off suddenly. \n\u201cWhat is it, Stilinski?\u201d Jackson sounded concerned in spite of himself as he turned to face Stiles.\n\u201cIt\u2019s January 2005,\u201d Stiles whispered, wiping a sudden tear from his face in the hopes that Jackson wouldn\u2019t see it.\n\u201cYeah, so?\u201d\n\u201cSo my mom just died.\u201d\nFor once, Jackson bit back a smart ass comment and stood there awkwardly in silence.\n\u201cShe died just after Thanksgiving in 2004,\u201d Stiles continued. \u201cAt this point, I \u2013 little me \u2013 would be living at Scott\u2019s house.\u201d\nJackson looked like he wanted to ask, but refrained.\nStiles cleared his throat and shook his head, silently begging Jackson not to mention what just happened. \u201cAnyway, my place is out. Dad\u2019ll be there. He took some time off, after, to \u2013\u201d\n\u201cJanuary 2005, did you say?\u201d Jackson mercifully changed the subject. \u201cWe can go to my house. My parents take a two month long vacation every Christmas to Ibiza. I\u2019d be crashing with Danny right now, so my house is empty.\u201d\nThey shared a soft look, both unsure how they went from bickering at the Animal Clinic to sharing sad childhood memories in the span of half an hour.\nStiles spared Jackson a smile before nodding towards the road. He heard a muffled, \u201cshut up, Stilinski,\u201d before Jackson fell into step behind him.\nThey were walking for about twenty minutes before Stiles started to hear cars. As they broke through the tree line, Stiles stuck his thumb out.\nTo their utter shock, a very familiar Camaro came speeding around the corner only seconds later. It slowed to a halt in front of them.\nJackson tensed up and stepped in front of Stiles almost instinctively. Stiles ducked out from around the wolf to get a glimpse of the driver.\nThe resemblance was unmistakable. Behind the wheel was a young Peter Hale.\nPeter, in a gesture so familiar to Stiles he couldn\u2019t help but smile, leered at the two boys on the side of the road. \u201cCan I help you, gentlemen?\u201d\nStiles swallowed and cleared his throat. \u201cUh, yeah, we\u2019re trying to get to our friend\u2019s house.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you thought you\u2019d just walk there?\u201d Peter raised one eyebrow expertly. His eyes roamed over Jackson appreciatively.\nStiles placed his hand on Jackson\u2019s back in an attempt to prevent him from growling and giving away his wolfy predisposition. \n\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles chuckled self deprecatingly. \u201cGuess we misjudged some things.\u201d\nHis brain worked overtime to make sure the next few sentences were close enough to the truth not to trigger Peter\u2019s built-in lie detector. \u201cDo you know the Lahey house?\u201d\nPeter nodded once, but made no move to invite them into the car. \u201cI do.\u201d\n\u201cWe know Camden, the oldest brother,\u201d Jackson cut in. Stiles sighed in relief internally as he remembered that Jackson actually did know the Lahey\u2019s \u2013 having grown up across the street from them. \u201cAny chance we could catch a ride?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Peter, clearly enjoying himself. \u201cMy mother always told me to be wary of strangers.\u201d\n\u201cThen maybe we should introduce ourselves,\u201d offered Stiles. Remembering that he hadn\u2019t started going by Stiles until about six months after his mother\u2019s death, he figured the nickname couldn\u2019t hurt to share. \u201cMy real name is unpronounceable, so you can call me Stiles.\u201d He hooks a thumb over his shoulder at Jackson. \u201cWe call him Jackass, but you can call him Jay.\u201d\nPeter said something under his breath that caused Jackson to step almost imperceptibly back. He played it off as him shifting his weight on his feet, but Stiles didn\u2019t miss the way Peter\u2019s eyes lingered on Jackson after the movement.\n\u201cAlright,\u201d he decided with a fake put-upon sigh. \u201cCome on in, I\u2019ll give you a ride.\u201d\nStiles and Jackson exchanged nervous glances and both opted to sit in the back seat. \nThe ride was filled with half-truths and awkward silences, which Peter seemed to revel in. He really was just as creepy before the fire as after it.\n\u201cSo, how do you boys know the Lahey\u2019s?\u201d Peter crooned as they pulled up to the house. \n\u201cHow does anybody know anybody?\u201d Stiles laughed nervously, grabbing Jackson\u2019s shoulder and bodily removing him from the car as fast as he could. \u201cBye, thanks for the ride!\u201d he said pointedly, clearly inviting Peter to drive away.\n\u201cGoodbye, Stiles,\u201d he purred, eliciting a shiver from both Stiles and Jackson. \u201cI do hope we meet again soon.\u201d\nStiles didn\u2019t like the knowing grin Peter threw their way. He shook the man from his mind as the Camaro turned the corner, determined to focus instead on the next task at hand \u2013 finding Talia Hale.\nJackson had no problem getting them into his house; they hid the spare key under the same rock in 2005 as they did currently. Jackson led them upstairs so they could shower and change before coming up with a plan to approach the Alpha.\n\u201cOh my god, lizard boy, does your family own anything without a collar on it?\u201d Stiles groaned after his shower, rifling through Mr. Whittemore\u2019s dresser drawers. \nJackson entered the room wearing nothing but a towel. \u201cSorry we have class, Stilinski. Does your dad own anything that doesn\u2019t say Beacon County Sheriff\u2019s Station on it?\u201d\n\u201cFuck off,\u201d Stiles pouted, not conceding the point, but not having any evidence to prove him wrong. He grabbed the least offensive article of clothing, which ended up being just a plain black t shirt, and threw it on with his jeans while Jackson put on some clothes in the next room. \nStiles peeked outside and thought he saw a boy no older than ten in the window of the house across the street. The blinds closed abruptly and with a jolt, Stiles realized the kid must have been Isaac. \n\u201cWe can\u2019t do anything for him right now, Stiles.\u201d Jackson\u2019s voice startled Stiles out of his reverie. Jackson, who had joined Stiles at the window and was wearing a surprisingly soft expression, looked sad for a moment before his practiced mask of indifference took hold. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he nodded towards the stairs.\nStiles followed and they sat down in the living room to devise a plan.\nAn hour later, they were no closer to having a fully fledged plan then they had been when they first landed in 2005. \n\u201cWe are not seducing our way into their house,\u201d Stiles said for the fifth time.\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Jackson argued again. \u201cI\u2019ve told you before, I\u2019m everyone\u2019s type. And Cora\u2019s hot.\u201d\nStiles rolled his eyes so hard it physically hurt him. \u201cCora\u2019s like ten in this timeline, you idiot. You\u2019d have better luck with Laura.\u201d\n\u201cWell then why don\u2019t you seduce Derek into letting you in?\u201d Jackson responded slyly.\n\u201cNo. Not an option. Derek\u2019s had enough of that to last a lifetime,\u201d Stiles said fiercely. \u201cBesides, that wouldn\u2019t work on him anyway. He\u2019s not even remotely interested in me.\u201d The last part he said a little more quietly, hanging his head so Jackson couldn\u2019t see the blush spread through his cheeks.\nJackson huffed. \u201cYou can duck all you want, I can smell the misery on you. We are so not having this conversation right now. Fine, seduction is out. What are we supposed to do, make friends with them?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Stiles responded through gritted teeth. \n\u201cWell, just look at them like that and we\u2019re in.\u201d Jackson tossed a throw pillow at Stiles\u2019 head, prompting a startled laugh from them both.\nStiles sat back into the couch with a sigh. \u201cI so cannot figure you out,\u201d he muttered. \u201cOne second you\u2019re a douchebag, the next you\u2019re catching me when I faint in the animal clinic and throwing pillows at me.\u201d\nIt was Jackson\u2019s turn to blush. \u201cShut up.\u201d He leaned back into the couch next to Stiles, where they sat for a while contemplating their options.\n\u201cWell this is all moot if we don\u2019t even know where to find them,\u201d Jackson pointed out quietly a few minutes later. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we can just show up at their house. Peter may have not realized I was a werewolf, but Talia Hale would.\u201d\n\u201cAnd she wouldn\u2019t take too well to having an unknown wolf show up uninvited claiming to be from the future,\u201d Stiles finished dejectedly. \nJackson nodded slightly. \u201cSo we\u2019re back to befriending them. Do you know where they\u2019d hang out? I mean Derek said once that he played basketball, but school\u2019s out for Winter Break right now. Did any of them, you know, have jobs or something?\u201d\nStiles shot up from his seat. \u201cJackson, you\u2019re a genius!\u201d\nJackson looked absurdly pleased.\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t get ahead of yourself,\u201d Stiles brushed it off with a wave of his hand. \u201cI just meant that in this particular situation you said something helpful.\u201d\nThe wolf pouted slightly and gestured impatiently for Stiles to go on.\n\u201cMy dad told my mom once that he\u2019d gotten a call to the local coffee shop, you know, The Morning Grind? There was a guy there acting all belligerent, and when she asked him who\u2019d called it in, he said Laura Hale. Maybe she works there?\u201d\nJackson sighed and got to his feet. \u201cIt\u2019s as good a lead as we\u2019re bound to get just sitting here. Come on, we can take my dad\u2019s car.\u201d\nThey pulled into the parking lot which was mercifully almost empty, and strode into the coffee shop. There was a ding that announced their presence but other than that, the shop was silent.\nStiles walked up to the counter and peered behind it. He jumped back with a yelp when a mountain of brown hair nearly whipped him in the face. \n\u201cHello,\u201d the girl said cheerily, righting herself from her crouched position under the counter. \u201cWelcome to \u2013 aww.\u201d She cut herself off when she took in the sight of Stiles\u2019 wide eyes. \u201cHi, Bambi.\u201d\n\u201cBambi?\u201d he repeated weakly, still not quite believing what he was seeing. \nJackson took a step forward so he was shoulder-to-shoulder with Stiles.\n\u201cHmm,\u201d she said appreciatively, eying Jackson with a different kind of interest. \u201cMy name\u2019s Laura. What can I get for you, handsome?\u201d\nJackson, suddenly oozing charm, leaned forward with his elbow on the counter. Holding his chin in his hand, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll take a double red eye.\u201d\nLaura snorted behind her hand and turned around to make the absurd drink. \u201cWhat about you, Bambi?\u201d she asked, sparing Stiles a glance over her shoulder.\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Stiles, still taken aback at the fact that he was in the presence of someone who was not alive in his timeline. \u201cI\u2019ll just have whatever\u2019s easy.\u201d\n\u201cSo, Laura?\u201d An achingly familiar voice announced the arrival of another member of the Hale family.\nLaura swatted at Derek as he passed by her behind the counter. \u201cDer, don\u2019t malign me in front of new friends.\u201d\nStiles\u2019 jaw dropped at the sight of teenaged Derek. Jackson cleared his throat under his breath, prompting Stiles to attempt to look normal. He shook his head and focused back on Derek and Laura\u2019s interaction.\nDerek spared Laura a quick grin, but it turned sad after a few seconds. Stiles frowned, trying to pinpoint the change, before he realized this would only be about a month and a half after Paige\u2019s death.\nHe may have stared a bit too long. When Stiles finally looked away from Derek\u2019s face, he was met with Laura\u2019s knowing glance from next to the coffee machine. \n\u201cSo what did you say your name was, Bambi?\u201d she asked shrewdly, eying Stiles and Derek. Derek had gone back to the far corner of the coffee shop, where a book and an iced coffee had previously been abandoned. His head was down, but Stiles could tell he was listening.\n\u201cUh, you can call me \u2013\u201d\n\u201cStiles?\u201d \nStiles couldn\u2019t believe his (lack of) luck. He heard a ding and turned around to find Peter waltzing through the door. \nLaura gestured between Peter and Stiles. \u201cYou two know each other?\u201d\n\u201cWe do, indeed,\u201d Peter replied, his eyes never leaving Stiles. \u201cTwice in one day? People will talk.\u201d\nJackson snorted and tried to cover it with a cough. Derek went back to actually reading while Laura finished getting their drinks ready. \n\u201cSo, do you all know each other?\u201d Stiles asked, feigning ignorance. \n\u201cYup,\u201d said Laura, hopping up onto the counter after depositing their drinks in Jackson\u2019s hands. Jackson handed Stiles his black coffee and adjusted his position so he was between Stiles and Peter. \u201cTall, dark, and broody back there is my little brother, and this old creep is our uncle.\u201d\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s nice to meet you,\u201d said Stiles genuinely. His heart broke a little at the thought of the Derek in the corner losing Laura. The very much alive Laura who was standing right in front of him.\nLaura frowned, and Stiles could tell immediately it was because of his scent. Jackson picked up on the change and attempted to distract Laura with a little flirting. It was the kind of flirting both parties knew would never lead anywhere, but was still fun to do. \nStiles left them to it and took a seat at another table near Derek\u2019s, trying with all his might to ignore the all-knowing looks Peter was sending his way.\nHe wanted to desperately to whip out his phone and mess around with his apps to diffuse the awkwardness he was feeling, but Kane had made Stiles and Lydia leave all electronics back in the clinic. \nTo his dismay, Peter pulled out the chair across from him.\n\u201cSo, are you two just passing through Beacon Hills?\u201d he asked as if he already knew the answer.\nThankfully, Stiles was spared from having to answer by the squeal of tires in the parking lot. A black SUV rolled to a stop in front of the doors. Two people got out and made a beeline for the coffee shop.\nStiles\u2019 breath caught in his throat when he recognized them as Gerard and Chris Argent.\n\u201cHey, Jay, come switch drinks with me,\u201d Stiles called across the shop. Jackson was so preoccupied flirting with Laura that he still hadn\u2019t noticed Gerard and Chris. Stiles\u2019 only hope of controlling Jackson\u2019s reaction to Gerard\u2019s appearance was if he could get the wolf to sit next to him calmly.\nIt worked.\n\u201cWhat do you mean, switch with you?\u201d Jackson shot Stiles an annoyed look, but surprisingly started walking towards Stiles with his hand outstretched, offering his cup.\nStiles nodded to the seat next to him and looked at the Argent\u2019s approaching through the window surreptitiously. Jackson followed his gaze and, to Stiles\u2019 shock, was able to school his expression and suppress a growl. Jackson nearly melted into the seat by Stiles.\nPeter, who had stood up immediately at the first whiff of Argent, walked over towards the counter and leaned against it next to where Laura was perched. His face was the picture of calm, but Stiles could see a muscle twitching in his jaw. \nDerek was still sitting at his table, but Stiles saw him crane his neck towards the SUV outside, as if hoping someone else would emerge from the back seat. Stiles felt sick when he realized that meant Kate had already gotten her hooks into him. \nJackson placed a calming hand on Stiles\u2019 back. To outsiders, it would just look like a normal gesture among friends. But Stiles appreciated it for what it was \u2013 pack comfort.\n\u201cCan we help you gentlemen?\u201d Peter asked, picking at some dirt under his fingernails idly once Gerard and Chris were both inside the shop.\nChris shot a wary glance towards Stiles and Jackson, clearly not recognizing either of them, but also not wanting to start a confrontation in front of civilians.\n\u201cJust here for some coffee,\u201d Gerard replied. \nThe sound of his voice made Jackson tense up. It was a testament to how nervous Peter and Laura were that neither of them noticed the sudden shift in Jackson\u2019s demeanor and scent.\n\u201cWe\u2019re closed,\u201d Laura replied lightly, attempting to look the picture of calm up on the counter. \u201cMaybe try the Starbucks a town over?\u201d\nGerard looked around the room and spotted Stiles and Jackson. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like you\u2019re closed,\u201d he said with a vicious grin. \u201cHow about two black coffees, my dear?\u201d Laura sneered at the endearment and was only held back by Peter\u2019s hand on her knee. \n\u201cTo go? I think we can do that.\u201d Peter jumped over the counter and filled the travel cups as quickly as he could. His eyes flicked to Derek as he passed the drinks to Chris, but Derek\u2019s face was once again pressed into his book.\nStiles saw a look he couldn\u2019t place pass between Chris and Peter during the exchange of money. It almost looked as though Chris mouthed the word \u2018sorry,\u2019 at the young wolf.\nThere was definite longing in Peter\u2019s eyes as he watched the Argent\u2019s walk away, and it wasn\u2019t for Gerard.\nGerard\u2019s eyes swept the room one last time before he left. He locked eyes with Stiles and it took everything Stiles had not to be the one to look away first.\nGerard spared him an almost impressed smile before leading Chris back out the door. \n\u201cFriends of yours?\u201d Stiles asked after the SUV had pulled back out of the parking lot.\n\u201cYou could say that,\u201d Peter replied bitterly. \u201cDerek,\u201d he said abruptly. \u201cTime to go home.\u201d\nDerek started to object, but a look from Peter silenced him. Peter had turned his back on Stiles, which led Stiles to believe he had flashed his eyes at Derek to get him to comply.\nPeter and Derek left without so much as a goodbye, leaving an edgy Jackson alone with Stiles and Laura.\nStiles distracted Laura while Jackson took a few deep breaths. \u201cIs it always this tense in here, or was it something we said?\u201d\nTo his surprise, Laura laughed. The tension bled from her shoulders as she hopped down off the counter. She shook her head and pulled out a cloth to start frantically wiping down any surfaces she could reach. \u201cNah, that\u2019s nothing,\u201d she said, trying to appear nonchalant. \u201cOur families just don\u2019t get along very well.\u201d\nThere was a finality in her tone that suggested Stiles wasn\u2019t going to get anything more out of her on that particular topic, so he switched gears. \n\u201cDerek\u2019s not much of a talker, huh?\u201d\nLaura stopped cleaning and raised an eyebrow at him. \u201cSaw that, did you? I couldn\u2019t help but notice that wasn\u2019t all you saw.\u201d\nStiles gulped and elbowed a laughing Jackson in the ribs. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d he denied unconvincingly. \n\u201cMmhmm,\u201d Laura hummed and pointed her washcloth at him. \u201cJust watch yourself, Bambi. I don\u2019t want some kid with doe eyes and a dry wit coming in and fucking his life up.\u201d\nHe nodded rapidly, ignoring Jackson as he continued to laugh at Stiles\u2019 expense. \nStiles and Jackson sipped their drinks for another minute in silence, wondering exactly what to do next, when Laura suddenly stopped cleaning and plopped down onto the seat across from them. \nShe let out such a world weary sigh, it made Stiles want to wrap a blanket around her and make her hot chocolate.\n\u201cPenny for your thoughts?\u201d Stiles said. \nLaura chuckled half-heartedly, but then it was like a dam broke. She let all her troubles out what seemed like a single breath.\nNothing about the supernatural, of course. She was overwhelmed, not crazy. But she ranted about her siblings and the pressure her mom was putting on her to \u2018take over the family business,\u2019 which she didn\u2019t know Stiles knew meant \u2018become the next Alpha.\u2019 \nShe talked for nearly ten minutes non-stop. By then, Stiles and Jackson had both finished their drinks and were just watching her. They would each pipe in every once in a while with a follow up question or noise of concern, but mostly they just let her go.\n\u201cOh my god.\u201d Laura sat up and covered her face with her hands. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I just unloaded on you guys like that. It\u2019s just with Peter being a dick and Derek barely talking to anyone, and then with the Argent\u2019s showing up like that \u2013\u201d\nStiles reached across the table and squeezed her shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s ok, we\u2019ve all been there.\u201d\nShe sent him a grateful smile and stood up, displacing Stiles\u2019 hand gently. \u201cI should close up. Thanks, though, both of you.\u201d\nJackson, who looked supremely uncomfortable, just kind of grunted in response.\n\u201cYou guys here long?\u201d\nStiles shook his head. \u201cJust visiting. Should only be here about a week.\u201d\nLaura nodded absently and took out a pen and an old receipt from her pocket. \u201cWell if you guys get bored or want to hang out with an oversharing nutcase at all while you\u2019re here, give me a call.\u201d\nStiles took the paper and nodded affirmatively. They threw away their cups and said their goodbyes. Neither Jackson nor Laura felt up to continuing their flirting charade, so they parted with a simple wave. \nJackson pulled over into an abandoned bank parking lot a few minutes later, once they were out of earshot of Laura. They both sat back into their seats and exhaled sharply.\n\u201cWe were not prepared for this,\u201d Stiles whispered.\n\u201cNope,\u201d Jackson agreed. \u201cWe have to save her, Stiles.\u201d\n\u201cYou bet your ass we do.\u201d\nStiles still had a pit in his stomach from seeing Derek look for Kate when the Argents came to the shop. He couldn\u2019t help it \u2013 Derek was only fifteen, and even though Stiles had put the pieces together from all of the reports on the fire he\u2019d stolen from his dad, it was still a shock to see this version of Derek being manipulated up close. Still so trusting, yet broken from Paige\u2019s death. If there was anything Stiles could do to get Derek out from Kate\u2019s hooks, he had to do it.\n\u201cPull over up here, will you?\u201d Stiles asked Jackson, pointing at the gate marking the South entrance of the Preserve. \nJackson raised his eyebrows at the request, but pulled over anyway. \n\u201cDerek told me once of this place around here where he\u2019d go to get away when he was younger,\u201d Stiles admitted quietly. \u201cI thought maybe \u2013\u201d\n\u201cGo ahead,\u201d Jackson interrupted. \u201cThere\u2019s something I want to do in town anyway. I\u2019ll pick you up here in an hour.\u201d\nStiles wanted to ask, but let it go. He shot Jackson a grateful nod and got out of the car.\nThe clearing Derek told him about was only a ten minute walk from the Preserve entrance, so it wasn\u2019t hard to find. \nStiles smirked to himself as he grew closer to being within earshot of Derek; it was only a few months earlier that he\u2019d been able to perfect his creeping technique in a way that even Derek couldn\u2019t hear him coming.\nKeeping his weight on the balls of his feet, and being extra careful not to step on any particularly crunchy-looking leaves, Stiles was able to get close enough to actually see teenage Derek sitting on a boulder before the wolf\u2019s head shot up.\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d Derek\u2019s voice rang out in the forest.\nStiles gave up on being sneaky then and announced his presence. \u201cHello?\u201d he called, feigning innocence. \u201cOh, hey! Derek, right?\u201d\nDerek squinted at him suspiciously. \u201cYou\u2019re the guy from the coffee shop, aren\u2019t you? Are you following me?\u201d\n\u201cStiles, yeah.\u201d He waved and continued walking until they were only about five feet apart. \u201cAnd no, not following you.\u201d He didn\u2019t elaborate. The less he said, the less likely it was that Derek would catch him in a lie. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\nDerek was silent for a minute while he took Stiles in. He looked like he had half a mind to just get up and walk away. Instead, he just slouched and replied. \u201cI come here to think sometimes. My family lives a couple miles away.\u201d\n\u201cThink about what?\u201d Stiles aimed for nonchalant and missed by about a mile. He winced and laughed self-deprecatingly. \u201cSorry, I guess I\u2019m not very good a subtlety.\u201d He hooked his thumb over his shoulder. \u201cLaura gave us the abridged version of some family stuff that\u2019s been going down. I can imagine that\u2019s not easy on any of you.\u201d\nThe wolf shook his head, still eying Stiles curiously. He looked like he was desperate to talk to someone about what was bothering him, but Stiles was still a stranger. \u201cLaura told you that?\u201d \nStiles just nodded and waited. Hopefully knowing that Laura at least trusted him enough to give him a condensed family history would prompt Derek to open up as well.\nFor a second, Stiles thought Derek was going to, but instead he sat upright as if something had just occurred to him. \u201cDid she send you here to get me to talk to you?\u201d He stood up and started pacing. \u201cThat\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s\u2026 I can\u2019t believe she did that.\u201d\nStiles waved his hand to encompass Derek\u2019s whole posture. \u201cNot that I don\u2019t want to dive into that particular sibling relationship, but no, Laura didn\u2019t send me here. I didn\u2019t even know you\u2019d be here.\u201d \nDerek stopped pacing and cocked his head to the side while Stiles spoke. Stiles barely repressed rolling his eyes at the young wolf\u2019s obvious attempt to read his heartbeat. Clearly he had not been taught stealth yet.\nWhen it was clear to Derek that Stiles was telling the truth, he relaxed minutely. After a few moments, he sat back down and hung his head. \u201cSorry,\u201d he muttered.\nStiles disguised his surprise at hearing the word come out of Derek\u2019s mouth and waved away his apology. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cDo you want me to leave you alone?\u201d\nDerek didn\u2019t answer at first. He raised his head and looked at Stiles with something akin to wonder. \u201cNo. And I have no idea why.\u201d\nStiles laughed, which seemed to break some of the tension. \u201cI have that effect on people. No one can resist my wily charm and sparkling personality.\u201d\n\u201cSparkling personality?\u201d Derek repeated wryly. \n\u201cHey,\u201d Stiles protested through a laugh. \u201cI can be sparkly.\u201d He moved towards Derek and sat on a downed tree a few feet away from him.\nThey were quiet for a few seconds, trying to move through the awkwardness of talking to someone you don\u2019t really know. Surprisingly it was Derek who broke the silence. \n\u201cHave you ever had a girlfriend, Stiles?\u201d\nStiles pursed his lips as his thoughts turned to his one-sided love affair with Lydia, the \u2018almost sex\u2019 with Heather in her basement, the maybe-it-was-the-Nogitsune-maybe-it-was-him virginity loss session at Eichen House, and the unrequited crush he had on his version of Derek. \u201cUh-uh,\u201d he settled on eventually. \u201cNot really.\u201d\nDerek frowned at his feet. \u201cI think I do.\u201d\nStiles\u2019 blood ran cold. He was talking about Kate. \u201cThink?\u201d he managed through gritted teeth.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Derek ran his hands through his hair and looked up again. \u201cI had a girlfriend, before \u2013\u201d he cut himself off.\nIf Stiles was a wolf with super senses, he knew Derek would smell of misery.\n\u201cBut now?\u201d Stiles prompted him, trying to get Derek away from memories of Paige.\nDerek shook his head and allowed the conversation to shift. \u201cBut this is different. She doesn\u2019t want to introduce me to her family, or even really be seen with me in public.\u201d\nStiles tried to keep his voice even. \u201cSounds like an unhealthy relationship to me.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d Derek denied vehemently. \u201cShe loves me, she told me. And I think I love her. It\u2019s just complicated.\u201d He looked up with wide eyes, imploring Stiles to believe him.\nStiles was struck suddenly with the thought that Derek didn\u2019t have anyone to talk to. He\u2019d clearly ostracized himself from his friends at school after Paige\u2019s death, and it wasn\u2019t like his family would have been open to a discussion about Kate. \n\u201cWhat makes it complicated?\u201d Stiles asked evenly. If he gave Derek an outlet for his confusion, maybe he could be one step closer to convincing him that the relationship was toxic.\nDerek looked around shiftily. \u201cWell, she\u2019s a little older than me,\u201d he admitted quietly.\nStiles nodded. \u201cYou look like you want to say more. Are there other things that make it complicated?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Derek made no move to continue.\n\u201cYou can talk to me, you know,\u201d Stiles prodded gently. \nDerek must have seen something in Stiles\u2019 eyes, because the floodgates opened and he just let everything out in a rush. His relationship with Kate, how it started, how his family wouldn\u2019t understand, how he loved her and trusted her and knew she would never hurt them. He made a vague reference to Paige\u2019s death, but only in the sense that he told Stiles he didn\u2019t fully trust Peter after \u2018what he did.\u2019\nHe slipped up then and mentioned how he\u2019d met Kate, \u201cin class.\u201d His eyes widened and he closed off his posture immediately. \nStiles frowned as he tried to parse through the sentence. \u201cSo,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cShe\u2019s a teacher?\u201d\nDerek\u2019s shoulders slumped. \u201cSubstitute teacher.\u201d\nRage shot through Stiles\u2019 veins like hot lead. \u201cLet me get this straight. This woman got a job at your school, manipulated you into starting a relationship with her, convinced you that she loved you and you loved her, won\u2019t introduce you to her family, forbade you from telling your family about her, and you don\u2019t think this is an unhealthy relationship?\u201d\nDerek stood up, suddenly defensive. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t understand. You don\u2019t know me at all, and you certainly don\u2019t know her.\u201d\n\u201cDerek \u2013\u201d\n\u201cNo, don\u2019t,\u201d Derek cut him off, already striding purposefully out of the clearing. \u201cForget I ever said anything.\u201d\nStiles ran his hand through his hair, pulling it in frustration. \u201cDamn it,\u201d he muttered under his breath.\nHe walked back towards the entrance, where he found Jackson waiting for him. He slid back into the passenger seat with his head hung and his mind racing.\n\u201cHmm,\u201d said Jackson pensively. \u201cThat\u2019s your, \u2018I fucked up,\u2019 face. What did you do?\u201d\n\u201cFuck off, Jackson,\u201d Stiles sniped half-heartedly.\nJackson just rolled his eyes and reached over Stiles to get a small box out of the glove compartment. He tossed it onto Stiles\u2019 lap and started the car.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Stiles asked, curiosity pulling him slowly out of his own negative headspace.\n\u201cNew phone,\u201d Jackson grunted.\nReinvigorated at the thought of being able to tease Jackson for the thoughtful gesture, Stiles spent the rest of the drive poking fun at him. By the time they reached the Whittemore house, both boys were laughing.\nStiles caught Jackson up on his interaction with Derek. Ignoring the eye rolls and derisive snorts, Stiles tried not to leave anything out that might help them moving forward. They toyed with the idea of just going straight to Talia, but they weren\u2019t sure quite how that would play out.\nHe had just finished catching Jackson up when his stomach growled loudly enough for Jackson to hear even without wolfy super hearing.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Jackson said, standing up from the kitchen table and leading Stiles back out to the car.\nStiles yawned and followed, rubbing his stomach absentmindedly. They pulled into the grocery store parking lot just as the sun was starting to set.\nStiles grabbed a cart and allowed himself to be led around the store by Jackson, who was putting all the most expensive products into the cart without even checking their prices.\n\u201cWow.\u201d Stiles whistled lowly. \u201cDude, you know the store brand is just as good and it\u2019s like much cheaper, right?\u201d \nJackson frowned and looked at the contents of their cart. \u201cI\u2019m not buying store brand groceries, Stiles,\u201d he retorted, as if the mere thought was insulting.\n\u201cHow are we even going to pay for these? It\u2019s not like we brought our wallets with us.\u201d \nJackson muttered some response about knowing where his family kept petty cash, but Stiles was too distracted by the sight of a familiar face at the end of the aisle to listen. Jackson caught a whiff of Derek\u2019s scent as the other wolf turned the corner and the two followed the Hale without a thought.\n\u201cOh, shit,\u201d Jackson swore in hushed tones. He pulled Stiles back into their aisle and ducked down, as if the sight of two teenagers ducking wasn\u2019t at all suspicious.\n\u2018What?\u2019 Stiles mouthed to him.\n\u2018Talia Hale.\u2019\nStiles\u2019 eyes grew big as saucers. Talia Hale couldn\u2019t find them. How were they supposed to explain that Jackson, an unknown werewolf, was in their territory and had no pack they could verify? They weren\u2019t prepared to answer her questions yet.\nHe nodded towards the door. They abandoned their cart, but only got a few steps before \u2013 \n\u201cStiles?\u201d\nStiles closed his eyes and turned around slowly. He pushed at Jackson\u2019s back subtly to indicate that he should keep moving, but Jackson remained stubbornly at his side.\n\u201cOh, hey, Derek. Fancy meeting you here.\u201d Stiles cringed internally at his attempt at nonchalance. \n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Derek asked him, taking a few steps forward so they were only separated by the cart. \nStiles gestured to the cart between them with a smirk, causing Derek to duck his head with a chuckle.\n\u201cYeah, ok, stupid question,\u201d he allowed. He raised his head and Stiles could swear there was a twinkle in his eye.\n\u201cDerek?\u201d An unfamiliar voice rang out from the neighboring aisle. Stiles and Jackson froze as a woman they had only seen in pictures rounded the corner and walked towards them regally.\nShe was exactly as commanding a presence as Stiles had expected. Her long brown hair fell in sheets around her shoulders, and Stiles was certain he\u2019d never seen anyone with posture as impeccable as Talia Hale\u2019s.\n\u201cOh, sorry, mom. This is Stiles and this is his friend, uh.\u201d Derek frowned, embarrassed. \u201cSorry, I don\u2019t remember your name.\u201d\nJackson smiled, all charm, and waved his hand at Derek. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d He turned his attention to Talia and nodded his head respectfully. \u201cYou can call me Jay. We\u2019d love to stay and chat, but Stiles and I are actually in a bit of a rush.\u201d\nOnce Talia\u2019s sights were fully on Jackson, her posture changed. Stiles knew in an instant she had figured out he was a werewolf. Derek shot his mother a confused look, but before anyone could speak, the clacking of heels on the far end of the aisle distracted them all.\n\u201cKate,\u201d Derek whispered almost reverently.\nNow it was Talia\u2019s turn to be confused. She looked back and forth between Derek and Kate, who hadn\u2019t yet realized she was sharing an aisle with the four of them.\nChris rounded the corner then, holding two different cereal options in his hands. The two of them bickered about which to buy, before Chris just shrugged and tossed them both into their cart. He looked up and did a double-take to the end of the aisle. He said something to Kate that Stiles couldn\u2019t quite hear, but that made the three wolves surrounding him stand up straighter.\nBefore any of them could move, a mother and her two children squeezed past Kate and Chris, planting themselves in the middle of the aisle with no idea what they had just interrupted.\nThe younger child, who was no older than four, looked around curiously while her mother and big brother picked out some cake mix.\nStiles saw Kate smirk at Derek from across the aisle, and moved to stand in front of him instinctively. Talia raised an eyebrow at the interaction and took a step forward as well, effectively shielding both Derek and Jackson from the Argents.\nStiles saw the little girl\u2019s eyes grow wide, and followed her eye line to Derek\u2019s face. The young wolf\u2019s eyes were glowing electric blue.\nWithout thinking, Stiles turned his back on Kate and Chris and latched onto Derek. He placed one hand on his shoulder and the other on his face, and turned him so he was facing away from the girl.\n\u201cDerek, your eyes,\u201d he whispered urgently. \nThe shock of learning that Stiles knew about werewolves was enough for Derek\u2019s eyes to return to their soft green color. He ducked his head slightly, taking care not to dislodge either of Stiles\u2019 hands, and took several deep breaths.\nTalia looked like she wanted to intervene, but evidently decided that between Stiles and the Argents, the Argents were the greater threat.\nDerek\u2019s hand shot up to grip Stiles\u2019 forearm. They made eye contact when Derek raised his head, the intensity of which caused Stiles to stop breathing momentarily. He saw several conflicting emotions in Derek\u2019s eyes; confusion, betrayal, hope, fear.\nStiles broke eye contact to see if the Argents were still there. He sighed in relief when he found that the four of them were alone in the aisle.\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok, Derek,\u201d he said softly. \u201cThey\u2019re gone.\u201d \n\u201cI think perhaps the four of us should speak privately,\u201d insisted Talia. She spoke at a normal volume, but her voice sounded like thunder.\nJackson ducked his head automatically and nodded. Stiles let go of Derek and moved to Jackson\u2019s side, staunchly ignoring the tingling sensation in his fingertips where they had contacted Derek\u2019s skin. Together they walked behind Talia like two school children being led to the principal\u2019s office. Derek walked next to his mom, but kept shooting Stiles obvious glances as they stepped out into the parking lot.\nTheir carts lay abandoned in the store.\n\u201cFollow us,\u201d Talia commanded, not unkindly, but in a way that brokered no negotiation.\nThey were silent on the drive to the Hale house behind Talia\u2019s SUV. They should have been using the time to get their stories straight, but a shared look between them before they got in the car told them that they both knew they\u2019d have to come clean.\nStiles only hoped their word would be enough.\nTalia had clearly called ahead to the Hale house, because Peter, Laura, and Derek\u2019s dad, Robert were all waiting out on the front porch.\nLaura looked betrayed and Peter looked smug, while Robert\u2019s face was a blank mask.\n\u201cDoes Sharon have Cora, Brian, and Andrew?\u201d Talia asked Robert.\nHe nodded and turned to walk inside after Derek and Laura. Peter followed them with a smirk.\nJackson frowned in confusion at Stiles, silently asking him who Sharon, Brian, and Andrew were. \n\u201cDerek\u2019s aunt and two little brothers,\u201d Stiles told him resignedly. He looked sheepishly at Talia, who wore a look of surprise. \nHe shook his head grimly and went inside to accept his fate.\nRobert, Peter, and Derek sat on the couch in the vast living room to the left of the entryway. Laura was perched on the arm of the couch by Derek.\nTalia stood next to where Robert was seated and gestured for the boys to sit across from them on the loveseat. They obliged and waited for someone to begin speaking.\n\u201cWould you care to tell us who you are and why you are in our territory?\u201d Talia asked formally.\nStiles cleared his throat and stole a glance at Jackson. \u201cWell, my name really is Stiles, and this is Ja \u2013 Jackson. Believe it or not, we\u2019re here to help you.\u201d\n\u201cHelp us how?\u201d Robert\u2019s voice was strong and confident, though Stiles could detect a hint of incredulity.\n\u201cSomething terrible is going to happen in \u2013 what day is it?\u201d \nStartled by the change in subject, it took Talia a few second to respond. \u201cIt\u2019s the 11th.\u201d\nStiles blew out a big breath. \u201cIn four days, then.\u201d\nRobert sat up straighter. \u201cWhat are you planning?\u201d\n\u201cNot us,\u201d Stiles assured him, shaking his head emphatically. \u201cI promise we mean you no harm, you can listen to my heartbeat.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know about werewolves?\u201d Derek demanded, speaking for the first time since they left the grocery store.\nStiles scratched the back of his neck nervously. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of a complicated question.\u201d He exchanged another glance with Jackson. \u201cWell, my best friend was bitten by a rogue Alpha a couple years ago. The Alpha didn\u2019t really stick around so we had to deal with his transition all alone. After that, there were\u2026 circumstances that led to a few others being turned, including Jackson.\u201d\nTalia frowned when Stiles paused. \u201cYour heartbeat was steady, but you are choosing your words too carefully. What are you not telling us?\u201d\n\u201cA lot of things,\u201d Stiles replied with a breathy chuckle. \n\u201cStiles,\u201d Jackson said gently. \u201cWe should just tell them.\u201d\nThey locked eyes and had a silent conversation. The fact that he understood everything Jackson was trying to convey to him was deeply disturbing, but also felt kind of nice. Jackson\u2019s eyebrows won in the end, so Stiles steeled himself to drop the bomb on the Hales.\n\u201cWe\u2019re from the future.\u201d\nLaura barked out a laugh, which was promptly silenced by a look from Talia. Stiles spared Laura a smile and pushed through with his explanation.\n\u201cWe\u2019re from about seven years from now. We were approached by a man who told us that in order to save Beacon Hills, we needed to come back to this time period and prevent something from happening.\u201d\n\u201cPrevent what?\u201d\n\u201cWhy you guys?\n\u201cSeven years?\u201d\nPeter, Laura, and Derek all talked over each other, prompting Talia to hold up her hand to quiet them.\nShe locked eyes with Stiles, as if the answer to whether or not he was lying could be found in his gaze. \u201cWhat is it that you were sent back here to prevent?\u201d\nStiles looked down at his feet and licked his lips. He tried to avoid Derek\u2019s eyes when he looked back up, but failed. \u201cThere was a fire.\u201d He tore his eyes from Derek\u2019s face and looked at Talia instead. \u201cAt the house \u2013 this house.\u201d\n\u201cA fire,\u201d Talia repeated weakly. \u201cAnd?\u201d\n\u201cAnd it took the lives of eleven members of your pack,\u201d Stiles whispered. \u201cWell, ten, I guess. Cora somehow made it out.\u201d\nRobert\u2019s gaze sharpened. \u201cHow do you know Cora?\u201d\nStiles cleared his throat again. \u201cI \u2013 we know Derek in the future. He\u2019s our friend, and \u2013\u201d he cut himself off, unable to finish his sentence.\n\u201cHe was my Alpha,\u201d Jackson admitted, sparing Derek a small smile.\n\u201cWas?\u201d clarified Laura with a frown.\n \u201cAlpha?\u201d Derek repeated. He grabbed Laura\u2019s hand in a tight squeeze. \u201cNo, Laura is the Alpha next. Does\u2026 does that mean she \u2013\u201d \n\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles interrupted immediately. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t die in the fire, Derek.\u201d\n\u201cBut I do?\u201d Talia asked.\nIt took all of Stiles\u2019 willpower not to duck his head when he nodded. \u201cYes, you do.\u201d\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re just supposed to believe all of this?\u201d Robert demanded sharply, rising from his seat. \u201cThat you\u2019re from the future, and you know all of our fates?\u201d His eyes glowed gold as they bore into Stiles\u2019.\nStiles nodded, not breaking eye contact. \u201cI know it\u2019s a lot to ask, but it\u2019s the truth. I can try and prove it.\u201d\nThe Hales were silent as they considered Stiles. After a minute passed with no sound, Peter finally asked how.\n\u201cDerek, ask me anything about you.\u201d Stiles turned his body so he was facing Derek fully. \nHe and real-time Derek had grown closer after the Nogitsune\u2019s reign of terror. They\u2019d bonded over their traumas, and they\u2019d both shared more about themselves to each other than they ever had anyone else. Stiles only hoped it was enough.\nDerek frowned at him. \u201cWhat do you mean? Like my favorite color?\u201d\n\u201cRed. Next.\u201d\nDerek\u2019s eyes lit up at the prospect of the challenge Stiles was issuing. His competitive streak led him to lean forward, forgetting for a second why they were all there. \u201cFavorite snack?\u201d\n\u201cCupcakes, but you tell everyone it\u2019s goldfish.\u201d\n\u201cFirst kiss?\u201d\n\u201cSarah Randall. You kissed her at the top to the slide in kindergarten.\u201d\n\u201cFavorite TV show?\u201d\n\u201cRight now, it\u2019s Fraiser. But in 2011 something comes out called Game of Thrones that we have marathoned several times.\u201d\n\u201cDream car?\u201d\nStiles snickered at this one. \u201cYou told the pack it was the Camaro, but you told me a few weeks ago you always wanted a hatchback with a large backseat.\u201d He threw in a shrewd wink for good measure.\nWhen Derek didn\u2019t follow up with another question, Stiles frowned. \u201cWhat?\u201d he looked around for something that might have caused Derek\u2019s playful mood to change. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cYou said \u2018pack,\u2019 does that mean we\u2019re pack?\u201d Derek asked, gripping Laura\u2019s hand again. \u201cAre we all pack?\u201d\nStiles\u2019 shoulder slumped as the seriousness of their situation settled back in. \u201cYou, Jackson, and I are, along with some others.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m still not buying this,\u201d declared Robert. \u201cTime travel does not exist.\u201d\nJackson snorted. \u201cWith all due respect, Mr. Hale, we\u2019re werewolves. You really think time travel can\u2019t exist?\u201d\nTalia pinched the bridge of her nose and exhaled sharply. \u201cOk, say we believe you. How does our house catch fire exactly?\u201d\nStiles bit his bottom lip nervously before responding. \u201cKate Argent burns it down after surrounding it with a line of mountain ash so no one can escape.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d\nDerek stood up abruptly and sprinted upstairs. A few seconds later, they heard the sound of his bedroom door slamming.\nStiles, desperate to follow Derek, stayed seated. He needed to convince the Hales that he was telling the truth.\n\u201cLook, I know this is all really hard to believe \u2013\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not, actually,\u201d Peter interrupted seamlessly. \u201cWitches have been messing with time travel for centuries.\u201d\nStiles threw up his hands and collapsed back onto the loveseat. \u201cNow you tell us!\u201d\nPeter\u2019s eyes sparkled with mischief. \u201cOh, dear, do we know each other in your present?\u201d\nJackson huffed disdainfully. \u201cYou could say that.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be happy to know that you\u2019re still super creepy seven years from now,\u201d Stiles added with an eye roll for good measure. Laura hid a chuckle behind her hand that made Stiles\u2019 heart break.\n\u201cCall Deaton if you don\u2019t believe us,\u201d suggested Jackson. \u201cHe helped us with the spell that sent us back here.\u201d\nTalia pursed her lips. \u201cAlan is helping out a friend at the moment. He is unreachable.\u201d\n\u201cA friend?\u201d Stiles repeated, confused. Realization struck him and he sat forward suddenly. \u201cYou mean Deucalion? I don\u2019t know how this whole time travel thing works, but you have to watch out for him, Alpha Hale. Please trust me on that. If we\u2019re able to get you past the fire, and you stick around in your timeline, you need to keep an eye on his movements.\u201d\nTalia frowned at the change in his demeanor. Stirred by his vehemence, she nodded carefully. \u201cOk,\u201d she agreed. \nRobert was still not convinced. \u201cI don\u2019t know why we are entertaining this \u2013 this child. He has given us no concrete proof that what he is saying is true. He clearly knows too much about this pack. He\u2019s a threat to us, Talia.\u201d He leaned towards Talia, imploring her to agree with him.\nTalia looked back and forth between Stiles and her husband. \u201cRobert, you heard his heart. You know he\u2019s not lying.\u201d\nRobert fisted his hands into his hair and began to pace.\n\u201cMr. Hale,\u201d Stiles said quietly after a minute had gone by in silence. \u201cYou weren\u2019t born a wolf.\u201d\nThe man stopped pacing and fixed Stiles with a surprised look. \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d\n\u201cYour son told me,\u201d replied Stiles, still speaking softly. Laura and Peter didn\u2019t know whether to look at Stiles or Robert. Their heads whipped back and forth rapidly.\n\u201cDerek told me you were born human. That you didn\u2019t even know about werewolves until after you started dating his mom.\u201d\nRobert squinted suspiciously. \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\nThe corners of Talia\u2019s mouth ticked upwards. Contrary to Laura and Peter, her eyes never left Stiles\u2019 face.\nStiles took a deep breath. \u201cYou chose to take the bite after the two of you got engaged. You chose to become part of her pack, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\nRobert just nodded, not sure where Stiles was going with the question.\n\u201cEven after your family disowned you because they couldn\u2019t handle the supernatural.\u201d\nAt that, Robert growled under his breath and took a step forward. It wasn\u2019t an aggressive step, but it was enough for Jackson to stand up and put himself in front of Stiles.\n\u201cEnough.\u201d Talia\u2019s voice rang out with authority. Both Robert and Jackson bowed their heads and abandoned their posturing. \u201cStiles, what are you getting at?\u201d\nStiles pulled at Jackson\u2019s arm until the wolf sat back down. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to say\u2026 you chose this pack. You chose to be a part of this family, even forsaking your old one. Are you really going to risk their lives because I might not be telling the truth?\u201d\nRobert was silent at that. He sat back down on the arm of the couch by Talia.\n\u201cYou die,\u201d Stiles whispered. \nRobert\u2019s eyes closed. He bowed his head and grabbed Talia\u2019s hand. \n\u201cTalia dies,\u201d Stiles continued. \u201cYour sons Brian and Andrew. Talia\u2019s sister Sharon, your mother- and father-in-law. Talia\u2019s other sister Maria and her two children. They all die. And they don\u2019t have to.\u201d\nThe man shook his head softly, his eyes still closed. \nStiles chanced a look at Laura and saw her wipe her eyes. She placed her hand gently on Peter\u2019s shoulder and waited with baited breath to see what her father would do.\nTalia looked at Robert expectantly, seemingly already knowing what he would say next.\nRobert exhaled sharply and met Stiles\u2019 eyes. \u201cOk, say I believe you. What do we do now?\u201d\nRelieved beyond belief, Stiles and Jackson spent the next twenty minutes answering questions and coming up with plans. They were careful not to go into too much detail about the future \u2013 Laura\u2019s death by Peter\u2019s hands in particular. \nAfter a while, Stiles found an opening to excuse himself and made his way up the stairs to Derek\u2019s room. He knocked three times and waited for an answer that he knew wouldn\u2019t come.\nHe opened the door to find Derek lying on his bed staring up at the ceiling. \n\u201cI\u2019m guessing an, \u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 wouldn\u2019t really suffice here?\u201d he joked half-heartedly.\n\u201cYou\u2019d guess right,\u201d Derek responded, not looking at Stiles standing in the doorway.\nStiles ignored the snark, as he usually did with Derek, and walked further into the room. He closed the door behind him and sat on a plush chair in the corner, just in Derek\u2019s eye line if the wolf were to turn his head away from the ceiling.\n\u201cGo away, Stiles.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re wrong about Kate.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d\n\u201cShe would never hurt me.\u201d\n\u201cDammit, Derek,\u201d Stiles exclaimed, standing up and approaching the boy on the bed. \u201cThink about it. She\u2019s an Argent, which doesn\u2019t automatically mean she\u2019s evil, but just \u2013 think about it. She doesn\u2019t want to be seen with you in public, she doesn\u2019t want you to tell your family about her, she got a job at your school and seduced you even though you\u2019re only fifteen. Do I need to go on? I mean, what part of you thought this was a real relationship?\u201d\nDerek sat up and swung his legs off the bed. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. She loves me,\u201d he insisted, with less conviction than he had when they spoke in the Preserve.\nStiles shook his head gently. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t. She\u2019s using you to get to your family.\u201d\nDerek looked down at his feet and didn\u2019t respond. Stiles took a few cautious steps forward and sat down on the bed next to him. \n\u201cAre you really from the future?\u201d Derek\u2019s voice was at a whisper, but Stiles could hear him perfectly. He just nodded in response, knowing Derek was looking at him out of the corner of his eye.\n\u201cDoes she really kill my parents?\u201d\nStiles couldn\u2019t help but wrap his arm around Derek\u2019s shoulder. The gesture alone was enough for Derek to curl into Stiles. He let out a shudder and Stiles knew right away that he was crying.\nHe wasn\u2019t sure how long he held Derek, but they were both startled when the door opened again. \nLaura walked forward swiftly and jumped onto the bed behind them. Derek and Stiles turned towards each other so they could see Laura better. Derek wiped his eyes with the back of his hand and let out a chuckle when Laura enveloped him in a tight hug.\nShe leaned back on her heels after letting go of Derek, and fixed Stiles with a serious look.\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling us the truth, right,\u201d she demanded.\n\u201cYes.\u201d Stiles kept his voice even, knowing they were both listening to his heart for a lie.\nLaura and Derek sat silently for several minutes, holding hands and hardly breathing. \n\u201cStiles, how do I die?\u201d Laura asked him softly, squeezing Derek\u2019s hand before letting it go.\nStiles frowned, his mind racing to find a way out of answering the question. \u201cHow do you know you die?\u201d\nLaura laughed sardonically. \u201cEverything you said downstairs just now, it was all about Derek and Peter. There was a little about Cora, but you tried really hard not to mention me.\u201d\n\u201cI \u2013\u201d Stiles stopped himself. \u201cI really don\u2019t want to tell you that, Laura. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019ll help.\u201d\nLaura looked like she wanted to argue, but fell silent.\nThe siblings locked eyes and seemed to agree in the same instant to brush off their sadness for now and move forward. \u201cOk,\u201d declared Laura, sitting up straighter on the bed. \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to figure out a way to prevent this fire from happening, and maybe that\u2019ll change my fate?\u201d She addressed Stiles with the last bit.\nHe nodded hopefully. \u201cIt might.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you,\u201d she pointed at Derek with a ferocity that made the boy recoil. \u201cMom has some questions for you, mister.\u201d\nDerek\u2019s eyes went wide, but he nodded solemnly. \u201cI know,\u201d he said quietly.\n\u201cOk, great. Let\u2019s join the others downstairs. But first, Stiles,\u201d Laura said with a twinkle in her eye. \u201cI need you to tell me how long you and my brother have been dating in your timeline.\u201d\n\u201cI \u2013 I \u2013 what?\u201d Stiles spluttered. \u201cWe\u2019re not,\u201d he shook his head, steadfastly not meeting Derek\u2019s eyes. \u201cWe\u2019re not dating.\u201d\nLaura\u2019s face quirked up into a mischievous smile. \u201cBut you want to be?\u201d\n\u201cLaura,\u201d Derek whined. \u201cLeave him alone.\u201d\nLaura pounced on Derek, ruffling his hair and muttering about defending his boyfriend, when they were interrupted by another Hale entering the room.\n\u201cI hate to break up whatever is going on in here, but your mother needs you downstairs,\u201d Peter said with a sneer. His eyes lingered on Stiles for a second too long before he turned around and left the way he came.\n\u201cStill so creepy,\u201d Stiles muttered, following him out. He was grateful for the distraction, but his mind was still racing with thoughts of him and Derek.\nThe three of them re-entered the living room. Derek and Laura sat back down on the couch while Stiles joined Jackson with an apologetic frown. He hadn\u2019t meant to leave Jackson alone with Talia, Robert, and Peter for so long.\nJackson just scoffed and nudged Stiles\u2019 shoulder with his own.\n\u201cSo,\u201d said Talia, effectively restarting the meeting. \u201cDerek, sweetheart, I need to know more about Kate. I know you may not want to talk about it, but it will help us. If you\u2019d rather speak to me privately, we can do that.\u201d Her voice was soft, but her stare was sharp.\nDerek hunched his shoulders and looked down. \u201cAlone, please.\u201d \nTalia nodded and took Derek\u2019s hand gently before leading him into the hallway towards an office. \n\u201cOk,\u201d Stiles said, clapping his hands once and rubbing them together. \u201cMr. Hale, you might want to call the rest of the family and tell them not to come for this full moon. It probably wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea to have Aunt Sharon take the kids somewhere safe, too.\u201d\nRobert still looked wary, but nodded and left to make his calls.\n\u201cLaura, Jackson, you guys should go get the blueprints from the vault and figure out the best way to fortify the house.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know about the vault?\u201d Laura asked with a frown.\nStiles shot her a grin and a wink, but didn\u2019t answer. Laura shook her head at him and made sure to muss his hair as she and Jackson left the house.\n\u201cAnd what about the two of us?\u201d Peter drawled, his eyes alight with amusement. \n\u201cWe need to go talk to an old friend.\u201d He whipped out the phone Jackson had bought him. \u201cI just hope he has the same number.\u201d\nPeter looked on curiously while Stiles dialed. It took a few rings before a gruff voice answered. \n\u201cHello? Who is this?\u201d Peter\u2019s back went rigid when he recognized the voice.\n\u201cWho I am is not important. It\u2019s what I know that will interest you.\u201d\nThere was silence on the line while the man considered Stiles\u2019 response. \u201cWhat you know about what?\u201d\nStiles knew that tone and smirked victoriously. \u201cAbout the Hales and what your family is planning to do with them.\u201d Before the man on the other line could respond, Stiles finished quickly. \u201cMeet me at the high school, out back by the lacrosse field. One hour.\u201d He hung up abruptly.\nPeter snarled when Stiles hung up. \u201cAnd why are we meeting with Chris Argent?\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d hedged Stiles, steadfastly not meeting Peter\u2019s gaze while he put his phone away. \u201cHe\u2019s somewhat of an ally in my timeline.\u201d\nPeter hummed while he digested that information. \u201cAn ally?\u201d he mumbled to himself. Stiles detected a shred of hope in his voice. \u201cBut why am I coming with you?\u201d\nStiles swallowed reflexively. \u201cI, um. I thought you might be useful in persuading him to help us?\u201d\nThe corner of Peter\u2019s mouth ticked upwards, but he didn\u2019t respond. He gestured for Stiles to start walking towards the garage, and followed the boy at a somewhat uncomfortably close proximity. \nThey were silent in the Camaro on the way to the meet. They were going to be early, but Stiles knew Chris would already be waiting. \n\u201cStay in the car,\u201d Stiles ordered Peter when they pulled into the parking lot.\nPeter scoffed, affronted. \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d\n\u201cDammit, Peter, will you just listen to me for once in your life?\u201d\nHis outburst caused Peter to bark out a laugh in shock. \u201cThat might be the first time anyone has ever yelled at me,\u201d he said once he had recovered.\nStiles rolled his eyes, but his expression softened when he saw Peter look longingly towards the lacrosse field. \u201cYou can hear us from here, but please just don\u2019t come out until I call for you. Please?\u201d\nPeter pouted, but nodded. He leaned back into the seat and closed his eyes to focus his hearing. \nStiles shook some of the tension out of his shoulders and walked towards the lacrosse field. He could see Chris pacing back and forth by the bleachers. As Stiles grew closer, he saw Chris place his hand on his sidearm.\n\u201cThank you for coming,\u201d Stiles said once they were only a few feet apart. \nChris squinted, trying to place Stiles in his memory. \u201cYou were at the coffee shop. Who are you?\u201d\nStiles scratched the back of his neck nervously. \u201cUh, you can call me Stiles. I have a proposition for you.\u201d\nChris stood up straighter and nodded at the boy to go on.\n\u201cI want you to help me save the Hale pack from your sister.\u201d\nIt took about fifteen minutes for Stiles to catch Chris up on everything. He told him all about the time travel and the fire, leaving out any mention of his and Peter\u2019s suspected relationship. He told Chris about Allison (not that she had died, but that they had been friends), and about their tentative alliance over the years. By the time Stiles was done, Chris was sitting on the bleachers looking worn.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not joking, are you?\u201d Chris asked weakly. He rubbed his hand over his beard, scratching it slightly.\nStiles shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not really sure how to prove it to you. I mean I can name and locate every weapon on your person right now if you want?\u201d \nDespite himself, Chris chuckled. \n\u201cYou can look up the Wizard\u2019s Council and see the research they\u2019ve done on time travel, but I don\u2019t think we have that kind of time. And they\u2019re not in your bestiary.\u201d\nChris\u2019 gaze sharpened as he rounded on Stiles. \u201cWhat do you know about my family\u2019s bestiary?\u201d\nNot deterred in the slightest anymore by Chris\u2019 glares, Stiles just smiled and waved his hand. \u201cOh, please, I spent the better part of the last year updating it for you. It\u2019s shocking how much Gerard got wrong. Though, I guess only looking at all the supernatural creatures like they were horrible demon spawns didn\u2019t help with the impartiality you need for effective intelligence gathering.\u201d\nAfter picking his jaw up off the floor, Chris schooled his face back to neutral. \u201cOk, say I believe you. Kate would never murder innocent people. She just wouldn\u2019t,\u201d he said, shaking his head fiercely.\nStiles took a deep breath and turned his body on the bleachers so he was facing Chris more fully. \u201cI think we both know that she would. And besides, she doesn\u2019t see the Hales as innocent. Neither she nor your dad follow the Code. You have to know that.\u201d\nStiles saw a crack in Chris\u2019 fa\u00e7ade and jumped on it. \u201cJust like you have to know that Peter Hale is still in love with you.\u201d\nChris\u2019 eyes shot up to meet Stiles\u2019. \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d\nBefore Stiles could respond, there was a mighty roar from the parking lot. Chris stood up, his hand flying to his gun.\nBut Stiles was quicker. He grabbed Chris\u2019 sidearm and the knife hidden in the man\u2019s sleeve. Chris barely got over the shock by the time Peter rounded the bend towards the bleachers, looking furious.\nStiles discarded the weapons and held his hands out in front of himself pleadingly. \u201cPeter just hear me out.\u201d\n\u201cBut you left me.\u201d\nThe voice was so small, it took Stiles a few seconds to realize it had come from Chris. \nIt was enough to stop Peter in his tracks. \u201cWhat?\u201d He sounded like he had been gutted. His face, which had taken on its beta form, lost its transformation. \n\u201cYou left me,\u201d Chris repeated, anger coloring his words now. He rounded on Stiles with fire in his eyes. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t know who you are or if you\u2019re telling the truth about any of this, but you don\u2019t know me. And you know nothing about my relationship with Peter, so stay out of it.\u201d \nHe picked up his weapons and placed them angrily back in their holsters. As he turned to walk away, Peter spoke.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t leave you, Chris.\u201d Peter looked as broken as Stiles had even seen him. His usually cocky posture was hunched, and there was no sign of smugness on his face. Instead, he looked like a heartbroken young man.\n\u201cOf course you did,\u201d Chris dismissed easily, not breaking his stride.\nPeter ran to catch up with him and turned him around abruptly. \u201cYou left me,\u201d he corrected. \u201cI got your letter \u2013 you wanted nothing to do with me. You wanted to marry Victoria and have kids and a white picket fence.\u201d\nNow it was Chris\u2019 turn to be confused. \u201cPeter, I never wrote you a letter. I left you a message to meet me and you never came. I called you dozens of times and you never answered or called me back.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nStiles held his hands up and backed away slowly. \u201cWell, I can see you\u2019ve got some stuff to work through so I\u2019m just gonna be,\u201d he hooked his thumb over his shoulder towards the parking lot, \u201cover there.\u201d\nNeither of them seemed to hear him, so he continued to make his way back to the Camaro. \nHe heard raised voices several times over the next twenty minutes, but no gunshots so he figured everyone was at least physically ok.\nThere was a brief stint of silence, which got Stiles a little worried. He sighed as he hoisted himself off of the hood and started walking back towards the bleachers.\nOnly to find Chris and Peter making out very aggressively on the lacrosse field. \n\u201cJesus,\u201d Stiles muttered under his breath. \u201cIs now really the time for this?\u201d he called at a louder volume.\nThe two separated as if they\u2019d been shocked. Chris smoothed down his shirt and cleared his throat, while Peter took only a second to regain his practiced composure.\nStiles rolled his eyes at the two and stopped a few feet away from them. \u201cOk, Chris. Will you help us?\u201d\nChris eyed Stiles warily, but his expression softened when he snuck a glance at Peter. \u201cWhat exactly do you need me to do?\u201d\n\u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa,\u201d Stiles insisted, backing away from Talia in the kitchen. \u201cI\u2019m not a wizard.\u201d\nIt was a true testament to Talia\u2019s patience that she didn\u2019t roll her eyes at Stiles\u2019 theatrics. \n\u201cNo, but you told us that you and your friend Lydia were successful in putting up wards in the Preserve,\u201d she encouraged him gently. \u201cSo it stands to reason that you have some magical proclivities.\u201d\nStiles frowned as he considered her point. \u201cDeaton did say I had something of a spark. I was able to manipulate mountain ash, and the wards did work.\u201d He nodded firmly, gaining confidence as he muttered to himself. \u201cI\u2019ll try warding the house, but I don\u2019t want that to be our main line of defense. There\u2019s a chance it won\u2019t work, and we need to be prepared for that.\u201d\n\u201cOf course. Thank you, Stiles,\u201d Talia replied, pleased. \nShe turned her back on Stiles and proceeded to make them both some tea. Stiles mumbled to himself under his breath, considering the types of wards he could place on the house and grounds.\nHe was startled a few minutes later when a pair of hands gently placed a pad and pen in front of him. He looked up to find Derek grinning at him.\nStiles blushed. \u201cWas I thinking out loud?\u201d\nDerek nodded and stole a sip of Stiles\u2019 long-forgotten tea. \u201cYeah, but it was kind of cute so you\u2019re forgiven.\u201d\nThe blush disappeared down Stiles\u2019 collar at that, causing him to have to fan at his face in an attempt to cool himself down. \nDerek clearly delighted in seeing Stiles react that way, and had just opened his mouth to say something Stiles was sure was totally inappropriate, when they were unceremoniously interrupted by Laura entering the kitchen.\n\u201cJackson\u2019s insufferable,\u201d she pouted, leaping up onto the counter and letting her legs dangle.\nStiles, who hadn\u2019t realized he\u2019d slowly been leaning towards Derek, leaned back into his chair at the island and laughed. \u201cTell me about it. At least you didn\u2019t have to deal with him when he was a lizard.\u201d\nDerek and Laura shot him identical looks of horror while Jackson\u2019s faraway noise of protest broke the silence that had followed Stiles\u2019 declaration.\n\u201cI got better,\u201d Jackson countered, waltzing into the kitchen a few seconds later. He shot Laura a wink and sat down next to Stiles.\n\u201cAren\u2019t you guys supposed to be coming up with a plan to fortify the house from an attack?\u201d Derek asked dryly, cutting into the sneering contest Jackson and Laura had started with one another.\nLaura just rolled her eyes at him and jumped down. \u201cFine, we\u2019ll leave the two of you alone.\u201d She turned her attention to Jackson with a wicked grin. \u201cHere, boy,\u201d she crooned at him, snapping her fingers like she was summoning a puppy.\nJackson opened his mouth indignantly and chased the now-laughing Laura out of the kitchen.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether to be happy or terrified that the two of them are bonding,\u201d Stiles mused aloud when he and Derek were alone.\nThey looked at each other pensively. \u201cTerrified,\u201d they agreed at the same time.\nThey spent the next half hour or so talking through different wards Stiles could put up around the house. Derek was surprisingly well-versed in the lore, and it took only a few minutes for them to get completely lost in their planning.\nDerek\u2019s mind wandered at one point while Stiles was busy writing down their latest ward idea. He looked up from the note pad to find that Derek\u2019s eyes had gone glassy.\nStiles cocked his head and reached out on instinct, placing his hand on Derek\u2019s shoulder to bring him back to the present. \u201cHey,\u201d he said soothingly. \u201cWhere\u2019d you go?\u201d\nDerek shook his head minutely and looked away. \n\u201cYou were thinking about Kate, weren\u2019t you?\u201d Stiles guessed.\nDerek let out a sharp breath and walked to the other side of the kitchen island. He ran his hands through his hair agitatedly before leaning forward with his forearms on the countertop. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe how stupid I was\u2026 thinking she could really be into me.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Stiles fiercely, hopping down from his chair and rounding the island. \u201cYou can\u2019t go down that rabbit hole. This was Kate\u2019s fault, not yours. She manipulated you, end of story.\u201d\nThere was a slight quirk in Derek\u2019s mouth, but Stiles knew it would take a lot more convincing.\n\u201cAre \u2013\u201d Derek stopped himself and turned away, embarrassed. \n\u201cAre what?\u201d Stiles encouraged him gently, ducking his head to try and meet Derek\u2019s eyes.\nDerek looked up and rolled his eyes at his own theatrics. \u201cIn your timeline\u2026 are we friends?\u201d\nStiles nodded easily with a smile. \u201cYeah, we are. We weren\u2019t at first, but I wormed my way in, and I think you \u2013 my you \u2013 are secretly grateful I did.\u201d\n\u201cAre we anything more than that?\u201d\nStiles bit his bottom lip, buying time before he had to respond. \u201cNo,\u201d he said finally. \u201cI\u2019m attracted to you, but you don\u2019t feel that way about me.\u201d\nDerek frowned indignantly. \u201cI\u2019m an idiot.\u201d\nA surprised laugh came out of Stiles\u2019 mouth before he could stop it. \u201cWell, yes, you are. But not about that. I\u2019m really just glad we\u2019re friends, especially after everything we\u2019ve been though.\u201d\nDerek looked like he wanted to ask more, but he cut himself off and closed his mouth. \n\u201cYou look confused,\u201d Stiles prompted gently. \u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind?\u201d\nThe boy blew out a big breath and stepped towards Stiles, putting them only a foot away from one another. \u201cI am confused. I\u2019m confused about Kate, and this whole time travel thing. And I\u2019m confused about you. I just \u2013\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got Kate\u2019s voice in your head telling you she loves you, and you\u2019re still reeling from Paige\u2019s death?\u201d Stiles guessed with a sad grin.\nDerek\u2019s head shot up and his eyes flashed blue briefly. \u201cHow do you know about Paige?\u201d\nStiles just gave him a knowing look.\n\u201cI told you,\u201d Derek said, defeated. \nStiles nodded and rubbed his hand up and down Derek\u2019s arm reassuringly. \u201cYeah, you did. And I know you\u2019re confused. So why don\u2019t we take this one step at a time? Step one: warding your house.\u201d\nDerek smiled and nodded his head. He stepped around Stiles and resumed his seat, but made sure to brush past Stiles when he did.\nStiles looked towards the ceiling for strength and joined the wolf at the table.\nTalia insisted that Stiles and Jackson stay at the Hale house for the remainder of their time there. After a somewhat somber dinner, Stiles sat down with Talia, Robert, and Peter to come up with a more succinct plan.\n\u201cJackson and Laura are going to start with the bulletproofing in the morning. The windows and doors will probably take them all day. I\u2019ll put up the wards tomorrow as well. Derek\u2019s been helping me, but some of them will take three people,\u201d Stiles began, speaking before they\u2019ve even sat down.\nTalia nodded once. \u201cRobert can help. He has some experience with rune magic.\u201d\nStiles frowned at the new information, but sent a smile towards the man in question. \u201cGreat. I\u2019ve got a few things to pick up from Deaton\u2019s in the morning, but I figured we\u2019d start around noon.\u201d\nRobert just nodded his assent and turned his attention back to Talia.\n\u201cAbout the Argents,\u201d she said stiffly, locking eyes with Peter. \u201cI won\u2019t deny that having someone inside their operation to assist us would be helpful. But before I can put any stock in Chris\u2019 intel, I need to know.\u201d Her eyes bore into Peter\u2019s, who stared back unflinchingly. \u201cDo you trust him?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Peter replied immediately. \nTalia arched her eyebrow while Robert shook his head. \nPeter reached over the table and grabbed his sister\u2019s hand. \u201cI loved him once, Talia. I know him.\u201d\nTalia cleared her throat and squeezed Peter\u2019s hand. Unable to give voice to her thoughts, she simply nodded.\nThe next morning, Robert drove Stiles and Derek to Deaton\u2019s to pick up the items Stiles decided he would need for the wards. Derek ran his fingers over the spines of some of Deaton\u2019s books in the back office, smiling to himself when he found one of the titles amusing.\nStiles noticed Robert hanging back, leaning against the doorframe. He was watching Derek with a soft, surprised look on his face, as if he was unaccustomed to seeing Derek smile. Which, Stiles realized with a pang, he probably was since Paige\u2019s death. He shook his head and busied himself with finding the right herbs.\nStiles cleared this throat a little while later, drawing the attention of both wolves. \u201cI\u2019ve got everything I need.\u201d \nDerek sent Stiles a smirk and brushed past him on the way out the door, while Robert simply nodded and followed the two to the car.\n\u201cTalia says you\u2019re familiar with rune magic?\u201d Stiles asked Robert as they drove back towards the house. \n\u201cI was,\u201d Robert responded tersely, closing the subject to further discussion.\nStiles slumped a little in his seat at the obvious dismissal, but smiled to himself when he saw Derek\u2019s hand reach back from the front seat, searching for Stiles\u2019.\nHe knew he shouldn\u2019t, that he was tempting fate or messing with the natural order or taking advantage of the situation, but he found himself drawn towards the comfort being offered, and the one doing the offering. He grasped Derek\u2019s hand tightly and held on for the duration of the drive.\nIf Robert saw, he didn\u2019t let on.\n\u201cSo, what kind of wards are we putting up?\u201d Derek asked as they got out of the car on the far edge of the Hale property. \nStiles stumbled getting out of the car, but righted himself as gracefully as he could before answering. \u201cOut here, I\u2019m hoping to put up some general wards. It\u2019s the ones closer to the house that will be the trickiest. These are just your basic perimeter wards \u2013 warnings and such so we have a head start if one of the hunters passes the property line.\u201d\nRobert, who had grabbed Stiles\u2019 backpack from the car when he saw Stiles stumble, looked begrudgingly interested in what Stiles was saying. He started unpacking some of the herbs he knew were useful in perimeter wards, setting them down on the hood of the car.\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Stiles mumbled, grabbing the ones he needed for the first ward. \nAs Stiles had expected, these wards weren\u2019t hard to put up. He didn\u2019t end up needing any assistance, and was finished in just under an hour. \nWhen they reached the Hale house driveway, however, Stiles paused before beginning the wards. \n\u201cUh,\u201d he said indecisively. The first ward he was attempting was arguably the largest \u2013 a fire resistance ward that would span the length of the driveway, through the house, and into the backyard. He needed to draw power from one of the wolves, but wasn\u2019t sure exactly who to ask for the help.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Derek asked. He approached Stiles cautiously, concern etched on his young face.\nStiles scratched the back of his neck nervously. \u201cWell, I need some help with this one, and in my timeline Derek usually helps me.\u201d\nDerek nodded enthusiastically. \u201cI\u2019ll help.\u201d\nStiles smiled at him. \u201cNo, I know you will. It\u2019s just,\u201d he turned his attention to Robert. \u201cYou have some magic in you, right? It would actually strengthen the ward if I was able to pull from another magic user.\u201d\nRobert straightened up, his posture screaming anger. \u201cI told you, Stiles, I do not have magic in me anymore. Once I became a wolf, I forfeited that part of myself. I don\u2019t appreciate you bringing it up a second time.\u201d\nStiles frowned, barely registering Derek\u2019s distress at his father\u2019s sudden mood change. \u201cWho told you that?\u201d\n\u201cTold me what?\u201d Robert snapped.\n\u201cThat you forfeited your magic when you became a wolf?\u201d Stiles took a determined step towards the man.\nWhen his father didn\u2019t respond, Derek asked lowly, \u201cWhat are you getting at, Stiles?\u201d\n\u201cWho told you that?\u201d Stiles repeated, his eyes never leaving Robert\u2019s.\nRobert took a deep breath, his frown still prominent on his face. \u201cDeaton did. But what does it matter who told me? You can\u2019t be a wolf and use magic.\u201d\nStiles let his breath out in a huff of rage. \u201cDeaton. I\u2019m gonna kill him. Listen to me,\u201d he said, taking another step forward. \u201cYou still have magic in you. There are some spells you can\u2019t perform now that you\u2019re a wolf, that much is true. But wards, runes, protection spells\u2026 all of those things are still within your power to do. Trust me, I looked it all up when I started using my spark. There\u2019s always a chance I\u2019ll need the bite to save my life after some battle and I wanted to make sure I could still help the pack if I was a wolf.\u201d\nMany emotions flickered over Robert\u2019s face. Ultimately, distrust won out and he shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you. I have no \u2013.\u201d\n\u201cHold this,\u201d Stiles interrupted, placing a small stone into the man\u2019s hand. \nRobert looked startled at the interruption, but his actions betrayed his confusion when his hand clamped desperately around the stone.\nStiles rummaged around in his bag until he found a small knife he\u2019d taken from Deaton\u2019s stash. He handed Robert the blade, along with a picture of a rune he and Derek had drawn the night before. \u201cCarve this into the stone,\u201d he instructed Robert gently.\nDerek looked back and forth between his dad and Stiles. He was bouncing slightly on his feet, his face full of cautious excitement.\nRobert stood unmoving for a minute before taking a deep breath and adjusting the knife in his grip. Stiles took a step back and watched the man carve the rune with ease. He smiled to himself, knowing without a doubt that it would work.\n\u201cOk,\u201d Robert said hoarsely. \u201cWhat now?\u201d He held out the finished rune stone towards Stiles, who just shook his head. \n\u201cNow you activate it.\u201d\nRobert closed his eyes and tilted his head back in exasperation. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cYou can,\u201d Stiles countered. He knelt down and dug a small hole in the ground by the mailbox before stepping towards Derek to give Robert some room.\nAfter a small sigh, Robert clasped both hands around the stone. He brought his hands to his mouth and started whispering an incantation. Stiles didn\u2019t have to hear the words to know they were correct.\nOnce the rune was buried, there was silence among the three. Stiles could tell that Robert didn\u2019t fully believe him, so he decided a practical demonstration was in order. Without warning, he picked up the knife Robert had discarded and threw it at Derek, who was standing a few yards away.\nBefore the knife had traveled halfway to Derek, Stiles was on his back. Robert let out a mighty roar and pinned him to the ground, his eyes flashing a blinding gold.\n\u201cDad!\u201d Derek cried out. Robert and Stiles looked up just in time to see the knife hit what appeared to be an invisible barrier around the boy, before falling uselessly to the ground. \u201cDad, I\u2019m fine. Look!\u201d\nStiles couldn\u2019t help but smile, despite his current position. He turned his attention towards Robert and saw a flicker of trust in the man\u2019s eyes.\nRobert followed a laughing Derek into the house, casting one last look at Stiles as the boy finished cleaning up after the runes had all been cast. \nStiles smiled to himself, happily recounting the wards he\u2019d helped Robert put up himself after the first one. If they all worked, the house should remain unharmed and the Hale pack should survive. \nOnce Jackson and Laura had completed the bulletproofing, they collapsed in a pile of limbs on the couch. Jackson halfheartedly grumbled at one of Laura\u2019s feet digging into his ribs, but he let it go in favor of laying his head back on the arm of the couch with his eyes closed.\nStiles huffed a laugh at the two and followed Derek upstairs. Determined not to think about Kate, the fire, or the inevitable impending battle, the two played video games in Derek\u2019s room until they were called down for dinner. Derek\u2019s phone buzzed several times while they were playing, but after ignoring the fifth phone call from who Stiles had to believe was Kate, Derek simply turned it off.\nChris Argent was sitting at the table by the time the two made it back down the stairs. Derek stiffened behind Stiles, and followed him much closer than necessary as they made their way to their seats.\n\u201cChris,\u201d Stiles greeted, nodding at the man.\n\u201cStiles,\u201d he returned, nodding as well. \nIt was clear that Robert was not happy with a hunter in their house, but one look from Talia stopped whatever he was about to say on the subject.\n\u201cChris, we\u2019re so glad you could join us,\u201d Talia said warmly with a smile that almost reached her eyes. Obviously she was trying to be genuine, but the snort Jackson had to cover made it clear Stiles wasn\u2019t the only one who noticed her tone.\n\u201cTalia,\u201d Chris responded. \u201cThank you for having me. Apart from wanting to be here, I do have some news.\u201d\nAt this, the rest of the table straightened up. Laura, who had chosen voluntarily to sit next to Jackson, waved at him impatiently to continue.\nChris nodded rapidly at Laura, clearly not yet every bit the confident veteran hunter he would grow to be. \u201cRight. My father told me they are planning an \u2018event\u2019 on the 16th. He hasn\u2019t given me any details yet, but he asked me to keep an eye out for any strange werewolf activity in the Preserve. Said something about how one of their assets is no longer cooperating.\u201d\nDerek coughed, turning the attention to him. \u201cI think that might be me,\u201d he admitted sheepishly. \"K \u2013 she\u2019s tried to get in touch with me a lot since yesterday and I haven\u2019t been answering.\u201d\n\u201cAs we had discussed,\u201d Talia said soothingly, sparing a soft look for her son.\nDerek let out a small breath and looked down at his plate. Stiles grabbed his hand under the table and squeezed. He\u2019d been aiming for a quick, reassuring grip, but Derek\u2019s hand tightened around his, so he left it there for the rest of the meal.\nAs they were wrapping up dinner, Stiles suddenly latched on to something Chris had said. \u201cWait, did you say the 16th?\u201d\nChris nodded. \u201cYeah, the 16th. Why?\u201d\nStiles frowned. \u201cBecause the fire happened on the 15th. Are you sure you got the date right?\u201d\nChris nodded again.\n\u201cWhat could have happened to make them attack a day early?\u201d Robert mused aloud.\nThe tentatively peaceful atmosphere that dinner had created suddenly vanished into tension and worry. \n\u201cChris, you\u2019ll try to get some more information?\u201d Talia asked. \nChris agreed readily as Peter stood to walk him out to his car.\nWith no other news or preemptive protective measures to work on, the Hales, Jackson, and Stiles went to bed uneasily after clearing the table.\nA little after midnight, Stiles\u2019 door cracked open. He hadn\u2019t been asleep, so he just called out quietly. \u201cWhoever that is, just get in here.\u201d\nTo his surprise, Jackson crept inside the room quietly, closing the door behind him. He walked over to the other side of the bed and pulled back the covers before climbing in.\n\u201cShut up, Stilinski.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say a word.\u201d\nBy the time the 14th came around, everyone was on edge. Jackson and Laura\u2019s bickering became more pointed, Derek began retreating in on himself, even ignoring Stiles\u2019 attempt to pull him out of it, and Peter was spending more and more time away from the house for secret rendezvous with Chris.\nChris, who had not been able to glean anymore information from his father than they\u2019d already had, made his appearances at the Hale house post-dinner scarce. The last thing they needed was for Gerard to catch wind that his son was spending time there.\n\u201cWhat time does it happen?\u201d Robert\u2019s voice shook Stiles out of his reverie in the library.\nClosing the book he\u2019d been reading, Stiles let out a big breath and rubbed at his eyes. \u201cThe fire department was called at 3:26am on the 15th. So we\u2019ve got,\u201d he checked his watch, \u201csix hours and forty two minutes.\u201d\n\u201cBut they said the 16th,\u201d Robert argued halfheartedly, collapsing wearily into the chair next to Stiles. \nStiles took a good look at the man. His eyes were unfocused and glassy, his hair a mess as if he\u2019d spent the last few hours running his hands through it. \n\u201cYou\u2019re a good father, you know,\u201d he said, apropos of nothing.\nRobert huffed in disbelief, but looked pleased nonetheless. \u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d\nStiles spared him a small smile before shaking his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I guess just the way Derek talks about you. My Derek,\u201d he clarified. \u201cIt took him a while to be able to talk about you and Talia, but when he does, it\u2019s clear how much he adored you, and how much he learned from you.\u201d\nThe side of Robert\u2019s mouth curled up for a moment. He looked longingly at the ceiling towards Derek\u2019s bedroom, where the young wolf had been holed up all day. \n\u201cYou should go talk to him,\u201d Stiles encouraged him gently.\nRobert nodded. \u201cI think I will.\u201d\nStiles thought that would be the end of their conversation, but before rounding the table, Robert paused and placed his hand on top of Stiles\u2019 head.\n\u201cThank you, Stiles.\u201d\nJackson was sitting against the arm of the couch with Laura\u2019s feet in his lap when Stiles went huffing into the living room several hours later. \u201cWhat are you groaning about?\u201d\n\u201cWell aside from the fact that you snore and I haven\u2019t slept in like three days,\u201d Stiles huffed again. \u201cI feel like something\u2019s wrong.\u201d\nLaura, whose eyes finally opened from where she had been napping on the couch, frowned deeply. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\nStiles looked around, peering out the windows to the darkened backyard as if he could see trouble through the trees. \u201cI just feel like something is happening.\u201d\nLaura swung her legs off of Jackson and sat up fully. \u201cIs it the wards? Is someone coming?\u201d\nTalia, Robert, and Derek, as if summoned by Stiles\u2019 distress, appeared in the living room to hear Stiles\u2019 response.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he shook his head. \u201cThe wards are fine. It\u2019s - ,\u201d Stiles\u2019 eyes went wide and he whipped out his phone. \nHe hit Peter\u2019s name and placed the phone on the coffee table, placing it on speaker so everyone could hear.\n\u201cStiles?\u201d \nStiles had never been so happy to hear Peter\u2019s voice. \u201cPeter, where are you? What are you doing?\u201d\n\u201cWell aren\u2019t we nosey?\u201d Peter purred into the phone.\n\u201cUgh, just answer me.\u201d Despite the seriousness of the situation, Stiles was able to roll his eyes.\n\u201cI\u2019m with Chris,\u201d Peter replied, confused at Stiles\u2019 tone. \u201cI\u2019m driving him back to where he hid his car.\u201d\n\u201cIt is almost three in the morning, Peter, we need you home,\u201d Talia insisted.\n\u201cI know,\u201d Peter replied with a softness in his voice Stiles would never get used to. \u201cI\u2019ll be there \u2013 \u201d\nPeter was cut off by a deafening screech of tires, followed by the sound of metal colliding with metal. \nJackson and Laura stood up from the couch, both wanting to do something but not sure what. Derek\u2019s eyes widened and he seemed frozen in place.\nTalia grabbed the phone and began screaming Peter\u2019s name desperately, even after the call disconnected. \nRobert and Stiles locked eyes and in that moment, Stiles felt the perimeter ward go off. \n\u201cThey\u2019re coming.\u201d\nAlmost as one, the six of them turned towards the front door. \n\u201cThe wards will work,\u201d Robert said confidently, striding over towards Laura and enveloping her in a tight hug. \nLaura whined into the embrace and squeezed even harder.\nJackson stepped forwards so he was shoulder to shoulder with Stiles. Their eyes never left the front of the house.\nTalia perked up, as if she heard something distressing far away. \u201cThey have Peter.\u201d\nDerek ducked around his mother and flung the front door open, ignoring the cries behind him to stay back.\nStiles and Jackson followed Derek blindly. The sight they were met with caused Stiles to audibly gasp.\nAt the end of the driveway, Kate and Gerard had Peter on his knees in front of them, facing the house. He was covered in blood and looked to be barely conscious.\nDerek growled loudly enough to be heard by Kate, who let out a derisive laugh. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, puppy? Don\u2019t like to see one of your fellow mongrels hurt?\u201d She kicked out at Peter\u2019s back, causing him to collapse forward onto the ground.\nTalia appeared from behind Derek and pushed the three of them behind her. \u201cWhat do you want, Gerard?\u201d she asked harshly. \u201cWe haven\u2019t hurt anyone; we have abided by your code.\u201d\n\u201cHave you?\u201d he crooned back casually, as if talking about the weather and not the potential annihilation of a friendly pack. \u201cWe\u2019ve had reports of several animal attacks in the area.\u201d\nTalia shook her head. \u201cThose are false reports, Gerard, you know that. Don\u2019t do this. Leave Peter and go.\u201d Her eyes flashed red, and Stiles was momentarily stunned at how she had successfully kept the desperation out of her voice.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Kate jeered. She reached behind a nearby tree and pulled a young woman back with her by her arm. \n\u201cMs. Morrell?\u201d Stiles wheezed.\nMarin looked up, but did not recognize this Stiles. After a few seconds, Stiles realized how terrified she looked. Kate was holding her at an awkward angle, as if holding a gun to the base of her spine. \n\u201cBreak them,\u201d she commanded, pushing the gun further into Marin\u2019s back.\nMarin took a deep breath and began chanting. \n\u201cNo, Ms. Morrell, please don\u2019t!\u201d Stiles shouted. He tried to step past Talia, but was held back by Robert\u2019s hand on his shoulder.\nJackson and Laura exchanged a fearful look, while Derek couldn\u2019t take his eyes off of Kate. \nStiles felt it when the wards were deactivated. On instinct he grabbed Robert and pulled him further inside the house. \u201cRepeat after me,\u201d he commanded.\nRobert nodded without thinking and placed his hands on Stiles\u2019 shoulder, mirroring the way Stiles had grabbed his. Together they began chanting, begging the house to retain its fire resistance.\nWith a victorious smirk, Kate threw Marin to the side and advanced on the house, taking care to step on Peter\u2019s inert form as she did so. She paid no mind to Marin sprinting away as fast as she could.\nKate\u2019s advance was halted momentarily by her brother\u2019s hand on her ankle. She looked down with a sneer at the man and shook him off easily.\nChris looked no better than Peter, but he was minimally conscious. He dragged himself over to Peter and laid beside him on the ground.\n\u201cPathetic,\u201d Gerard spat, sparing the two of them only the smallest of glances before following his daughter.\nTalia caught sight of the two Argent\u2019s approaching and took a mental tally of how many other hunters\u2019 heartbeats she could hear from the trees. There were at least seven that she could count. With Robert and Stiles out, they were certainly outnumbered.\n\u201cDo you smell that?\u201d Laura asked quietly next to Jackson.\n\u201cMountain ash,\u201d Jackson confirmed. \nThey were trapped.\nAfter taking stock of the situation, Talia roared. \u201cJackson, stay with Robert and Stiles. Derek, Laura,\u201d she unleashed her fang and claws. \u201cYou\u2019re with me.\u201d\nThe two Hales followed suit; Laura\u2019s eyes shining a blinding gold while Derek\u2019s shone icy blue. They took off towards the Argents, dodging a storm of bullets as they approached.\nTalia reached Kate before she could raise her weapon. They tumbled to the ground in a whir of screams and grunts.\nLaura turned her attention to Gerard while Derek ran to the tree line to try and take down as many henchmen as he could.\nDerek took down two men \u2013 incapacitating but not fatally wounding them \u2013 before a third got a lucky shot into his right shoulder. He could feel the wolfsbane enter his bloodstream, but the adrenaline held it at bay. He took down the man who shot him and rounded the driveway to get to the other four he could sense.\nTalia took a shot to the left calf from a stray arrow that slowed her down enough for Kate to unsheathe one of her knives. She got in a slash at Talia\u2019s abdomen that sent the Alpha staggering backwards.\nLaura was holding her own with Gerard. He was slower than her, but more cunning. She got in a few good shots early that had her wolf howling with pride, but he found a weakness in her right side and exploited it to stab her in the thigh. She roared and rolled until she could stand upright to catch her breath and remove the knife.\nTwo of Argent\u2019s men were hurling gasoline at the house, surrounding it completely with the pungent liquid. Derek surprised the one on the east side of the house and was able to debilitate him after a short scuffle.\nMeanwhile, Jackson was torn between helping the Hales and making sure Stiles and Robert weren\u2019t interrupted. His instinct was to obey Talia\u2019s order, but it didn\u2019t feel right to him not to help the fight when he could.\nA shadow in the backyard pulled his attention away from Stiles and Robert, who were still chanting desperately. One of the Argent\u2019s men was approaching the house at a sprint.\nHis attention was again torn when he heard a shrill scream from the front yard.\n\u201cYou bitch!\u201d Kate screamed at Laura. She abandoned her fight with Talia in favor of approaching the victorious beta, who had just succeeded in breaking Gerard\u2019s neck.\nLaura looked shell-shocked at what she had done, but could not find it in her to feel sorry when she took in the lifeless body of Gerard Argent at her feet. \nKate took a gun from one of her many holsters and pointed it at Laura with rage in her eyes.\n\u201cNo!\u201d Talia screamed, lunging at her. She caught Kate\u2019s calf in her claws and ripped them down her leg brutally. It was enough of a distraction for Laura to join the fray, though Kate seemed to be fighting with renewed vigor.\nDerek could hear three more men \u2013 one in the backyard and two in the front with torches, trying frantically to light them before they were seen. Judging those two to be more of a threat than the lone man in the backyard, Derek took off towards them.\nOne of the men abandoned his torch and drew a crossbow, sheathing and releasing an arrow into Derek\u2019s stomach before he could reach them.\nTalia and Laura heard Derek cry out. \u201cGo,\u201d Talia shouted to Laura. Laura ran towards Derek without hesitation, trusting Talia to finish off Kate herself.\nDerek pulled the arrow out of his stomach with a sickening squelch. Laura grabbed him by the shoulder and used her momentum to get him running again. \nThey heard the sound of a door being broken open from the back of the house, causing Derek to stumble. \u201cStiles,\u201d he whispered.\n\u201cI\u2019m good, go help Jackson,\u201d Laura shouted without breaking stride. Derek vaguely heard the sounds of one of the men screaming even before he reached the front door.\nJackson was on the floor in the living room, trying to pin down the intruder. Stiles and Robert were still chanting, but Derek could see Stiles glancing towards Jackson with concern.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got him,\u201d Derek reassured Stiles, joining the other wolf in his fight. Derek was able to get a good grip on one of the man\u2019s arms and yanked until he heard a pop.\nKate and Talia took that moment to burst through the front window in a hail of flying glass and blood. Talia was slow to stand up, giving Kate time to look around at the scene before her. Suddenly understanding what was happening, she hastily grabbed another gun from her ankle holster and pointed it resolutely at Stiles.\n\u201cNo!\u201d Stiles heard someone yell, before a body threw itself in front of him. He heard the faint sound of a gunshot before realizing it was Jackson who was now bleeding from his chest on the floor. \n\u201cJackson?\u201d Stiles felt the shock take over, but continued chanting. He tasted something salty in his mouth and realized he was crying.\nDerek, who had taken care of the other hunter, dropped to Stiles and Robert\u2019s feet to check on Jackson while Talia tackled Kate to the ground.\n\u201cIs he dead?\u201d Stiles asked Derek urgently through his chanting. \u201cDerek, is he dead?\u201d\n\u201cUh,\u201d Derek stammered, trying to stop the bleeding. \u201cThere\u2019s too much blood. I think the bullet\u2019s in his heart.\u201d\nSuddenly, Robert stopped chanting and dropped his hands. \n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Stiles asked weakly.\nRobert frowned. \u201cYou have to take him back, Stiles.\u201d\nStiles shook his head, but without resolve. He looked around at Kate and Talia fighting to the death, and could just barely see Laura trying to fight off two men at once as they hurled fire at her outside.\n\u201cI can\u2019t. The mountain ash. If they set the house on fire, you\u2019ll die.\u201d \nDerek ran outside again to help Laura, sending an unreadable look towards Kate, and another towards Stiles as he went.\n\u201cStiles, if you don\u2019t take him back now, he\u2019ll die,\u201d Robert said, pushing the boy to his knees in front of Jackson.\nTalia and Kate were locked in a stalemate. Derek and Laura were in a similar predicament outside. Peter and Chris might both be dead already.\n\u201cDamn it,\u201d Stiles swore, pushing up his sleeves and holding pressure to Jackson\u2019s chest. He looked up at Robert one last time. The man nodded solemnly as Stiles began to chant.\nStiles felt the world around him shift. He focused his energy on holding pressure to Jackson\u2019s wound and squeezed his eyes shut.\nWhen he opened them, he was in the clinic with a shocked Lydia, Deaton, and Kane.\n\u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d Lydia screamed. She bent down and replaced Stiles\u2019 shaking hands with her own surprisingly steady ones, attempting to stop the blood rushing from Jackson\u2019s chest.\nDeaton and Kane rushed to help immediately. Together they hoisted Jackson up onto the exam table and got to work extracting the bullet and burning the wolfsbane out of Jackson\u2019s system. Lydia stumbled back into Stiles\u2019 chest.\nHe wrapped his arms around her shoulders from behind, anchoring them both. \n\u201cWh \u2013 what happened?\u201d she asked again, more calmly. Her eyes stayed glued to Jackson\u2019s unmoving form.\nStiles cleared his throat. \u201cHe caught me when I fell, so he came with me. Kate shot him.\u201d\n\u201cKate?\u201d Lydia replied with wide eyes, turning in Stiles\u2019 arms at the news. \u201cDoes that mean it worked? Is she dead? Are the Hales ok?\u201d\n\u201cI had to take us back early. I don\u2019t know if \u2013,\u201d he ducked his head in shame. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened.\u201d\nLydia pulled him close, not caring that he was covered in Jackson\u2019s blood. They stood like that for several minutes until they heard Deaton speak.\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to be ok.\u201d\nStiles felt all the air whoosh out of his lungs. He and Lydia separated and rushed to the exam table to see with their own eyes that Jackson was still alive.\n\u201cStiles, I need to know what happened,\u201d Kane instructed gently while Deaton began cleaning up the room.\nBefore Stiles could respond, his vision blacked out suddenly and he stumbled. Someone caught him as he hit the ground, but before he could figure out who it was, he lost consciousness.\nWhen he came to, he realized Lydia and Deaton had also fainted. He sat upright in the chair he had been deposited on and took stock of his physical state. He felt fine, but was mentally woozy.\n\u201cStiles, what do you remember?\u201d Kane asked him. It looked like only seconds had gone by. Kane was still in the process of depositing Deaton into a chair next to Lydia\u2019s.\nStiles rubbed his hands over his face and leaned back, closing his eyes. He was suddenly met with visions of a life he knew he hadn\u2019t lived, but he felt in his soul he had.\nMaking friends with Cora in middle school. He, Cora, and Scott becoming thick as thieves in the cafeteria.\nWatching Derek from the stands during Varsity basketball games. Holding up a sign made of pink glitter with his name on it, Laura home from college wolf-whistling through half time.\nDinners at the Hale house. The people around him are blurry; he can only make out Derek and Laura\u2019s faces at the table.\nHis eyes shot open and he bounded to his feet. \u201cIt worked!\u201d he exclaimed, rousing Lydia and Deaton from their slumber.\nLydia rubbed her eyes sleepily. Stiles waited for her to remember her \u2018life,\u2019 but he didn\u2019t have to wait long. \u201cOh my god,\u201d she whispered under her breath, her eyes round as saucers. \u201cStiles, oh my god.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you remember?\u201d Kane asked again.\nStiles and Lydia walked towards each other as if pulled by magnets. \u201cThe Hales \u2013 we know them,\u201d Stiles started.\n\u201cBut we don\u2019t,\u201d Lydia finished, breathless. \u201cWe don\u2019t, but Laura helped me pick out what colleges I want to apply to.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I remember Derek being crowned Prom King. Cora and I gave him so much shit.\u201d Stiles broke off with a grin. \nKane sighed in relief. \u201cDo you remember them all? Are they all alive? We need the Hale pack as whole as possible. The more of them there are, the more stability we will be able to bring to the Nemeton.\u201d\nLydia and Stiles frowned and exchanged a worried glance. \u201cIt\u2019s coming back in pieces, some of it is foggy. I only remember Derek, Cora, and Laura,\u201d Stiles said as Lydia nodded along.\n\u201cNothing about Alpha Hale? Or her brother?\u201d\nThe two shook their heads.\n\u201cWe have to go to the Hale house,\u201d Stiles said urgently, knowing in his bones it would still be standing. \nLydia nodded frantically and rounded on Deaton. \u201cCan he travel?\u201d she asked, walking towards Jackson.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Jackson groused. Lydia perked up, but her reunion was interrupted by Stiles throwing himself into Jackson\u2019s arms.\n\u201cDamn it, Jay,\u201d Stiles swore, squeezing the wolf with all his might. \u201cYou scared the shit out of me. What were you thinking?\u201d He pulled back with a smack to the side of Jackson\u2019s head.\n\u201cOw,\u201d Jackson deadpanned. He looked around sheepishly, avoiding eye contact. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I just reacted. She was going to shoot you,\u201d he mumbled.\nLydia looked between the two, fascinated. \u201cI don\u2019t even want to know. Come on,\u201d she instructed, crooking her finger at the both of them. \u201cWe gotta go.\u201d\nStiles went to help Jackson off the table but was held back by a snarl. He held up his hands innocently and was barely able to stifle a laugh.\n\u201cMeet us at the house a little later?\u201d Lydia told Deaton and Kane. They both nodded and went about cleaning up the rest of the spell and blood.\nJackson had his epiphany in the car. He passed out for about half a minute in the back seat and awoke with a cry of, \u201cLaura!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah, buddy. We\u2019re almost there,\u201d Stiles said lazily.\nJackson shook his head in wonder. \u201cBut I remember her. Her and Cora and Derek. We \u2013 we grew up with them? But we didn\u2019t.\u201d \nBefore Stiles could answer, his phone rang. He looked at who was calling and picked it up right away, placing it on speaker on the dashboard. \u201cDerek?\u201d\n\u201cStiles?\u201d Derek croaked. \u201cStiles, what\u2019s going on? Something feels wrong.\u201d\nStiles looked around at Lydia and Jackson before answering. \u201cNothing\u2019s wrong. Something happened, though. Can you meet me at your house?\u201d\n\u201cAt the loft?\u201d he responded in confusion. \n\u201cNo, your house. In the Preserve.\u201d\n\u201cStiles, why \u2013\u201d\n\u201cDerek, do you trust me?\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d he replied instantly.\nStiles felt a rush of emotions at the response, but tamped it down momentarily. \u201cThen meet me at the house. I can\u2019t explain over the phone, there\u2019s just something you need to see.\u201d He hung up and sighed deeply.\nThe three wore matching frowns for the duration of the drive. \nThey pulled up to the magnificently still-standing Hale house. Before Stiles could put the jeep in park, the passenger doors were open. Jackson sprinted inside, followed closely by Lydia, then Stiles.\n\u201cLaura!\u201d Jackson called once he was in the living room. \nThey looked around wildly for any signs of the Hale pack. \nStiles stopped short in the doorway of the library. On the ground unconscious were Talia and Robert Hale.\nThe air left Stiles\u2019 lungs as he collapsed onto the floor by Talia\u2019s head. He could still hear Jackson calling for Laura throughout the rest of the house. \u201cTalia?\u201d Stiles shook her shoulder gently.\nTalia blinked awake. She sat up and looked around before her eyes came to rest on Stiles. \u201cStiles?\u201d she asked lazily, rubbing her face. Her eyes grew wide as her memories came flying back. \u201cStiles!\u201d\nShe pulled him into a fierce embrace, tears flying freely down both of their faces. \u201cOh, Stiles, you did it. You saved us.\u201d She pulled back and cradled Stiles\u2019 face in her hands. \u201cYou\u2019re ok.\u201d\nStiles sat back on his heels with a small laugh. \u201cI\u2019m ok? I left you fighting to the death with Kate Argent and you were worried about me?\u201d\nTalia just shook her head with a smile. \u201cAnd Jackson \u2013 is he here? Is he ok?\u201d\nJust then, the boy in question came running into the library with a Laura-shaped barnacle on his back. The grin on his face was wide enough to elicit a similar one from both Stiles and Talia. \nLydia entered behind them at a slower pace, but she was smiling as well.\nRobert woke up a few seconds later, allowing them all to have a small reunion before the sound of Derek\u2019s car in the driveway distracted Talia. She started towards the door, but was held back by Stiles.\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s happening,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cHe may have gotten some of his \u2018memories\u2019 back, but as far as he knows, you\u2019re still dead. Maybe I should talk to him first?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s probably a good idea,\u201d Robert said, nodding at Talia.\nStiles ran towards the front door and opened it before Derek was out of his car. \n\u201cStiles, what\u2019s going on?\u201d he asked in an awed voice, his eyes raking up and down the perfectly-intact Hale house reverently. \u201cWhy is my house here? It\u2019s exactly the way I remember it. Why do I have these memories of my family that I know never happened? Did you do something?\u201d\nDerek was halfway up the porch, so Stiles stepped forward to block his entry into the house. \u201cYeah, sort of. Maybe you should sit down?\u201d He gestured to the porch steps and took a seat next to Derek.\nIt took about ten minutes to catch Derek up on everything that had happened. Derek hadn\u2019t said a word the entire time Stiles had been talking, but looked sharply towards the house several times as if he had heard something. \nHe took several deep breaths and closed his eyes. Without thought, Stiles reached out and grabbed Derek\u2019s hand. Derek latched on and opened his eyes, looking straight into Stiles\u2019. \u201cWhere are they?\u201d\n\u201cRight here, darling,\u201d Talia responded from the doorway. \nDerek shot up and ran into his mother\u2019s arms.\nRobert appeared next to the two and was pulled into the embrace. Derek\u2019s hand fisted in the back of his shirt as if he was never going to let go.\nStiles got up and brushed off his jeans. Behind Derek, Talia, and Robert, Stiles could see Laura crying softly with her arm around Jackson\u2019s shoulders.\nDerek sniffed when his parents let him go, but he barely had a chance to wipe at his eyes before Laura launched herself into his arms. \nKane and Deaton arrived about a minute later. Derek and Talia both began questioning them before they made it out of the car.\nKane answered most of the questions, telling the group patiently that everything had worked perfectly, and that their memories would be coming back slowly over the next 24 hours. \n\u201cAre they real?\u201d Stiles asked. \n\u201cYes and no,\u201d Kane replied. \u201cThey aren\u2019t real in the sense that you actually lived them, but they are real in the sense that they affect you the same way your real memories would.\u201d\nHe paused before continuing almost sheepishly. \u201cThere is one more thing. The Council and I may have taken a few liberties when helping to create your new memories and tidy up loose ends.\u201d\nKane began to elaborate a bit, but was cut off when Stiles collapsed.\nStiles opened his eyes less than a minute later and found that he was sitting on the porch steps with Derek, Talia, Robert, Laura, and Lydia all crowded around him.\n\u201cAre you ok?\u201d Derek asked him with a frown.\nStiles couldn\u2019t help but smile at the concern and patted the wolf\u2019s chest reassuringly. \u201cI\u2019m fine, but I remembered a few more things.\u201d\nHe stood up and ran up the stairs into the house with Derek hot on his heels. Stiles closed his eyes and accessed his new memories to visualize the room he was looking for.\nHe sprinted up to the second floor and flung one of the doors open. On the floor were two figures who were just waking up from what Stiles was now calling a \u2018memory nap.\u2019\n\u201cErica!\u201d he cried, throwing himself onto the floor and wrapping his arms around her.\n\u201cBoyd?\u201d Derek croaked, reaching a hand out on auto-pilot to help the beta to his feet. Boyd smiled and hugged Derek, manfully ignoring the tears in both their eyes.\nErica let go of Stiles and jumped up into Derek\u2019s arms. Boyd helped Stiles up and clapped his back. \u201cGood to see you, man.\u201d\nThe four head back downstairs with smiles on their faces. They all piled into the living room with the others to hear the story of what happened that night after Stiles and Jackson had to leave.\nTalia was recounting how she killed Kate when Lydia and Jackson had a memory nap. They both came to and laughed to themselves about all the memories they had gotten back. Lydia curled herself under Jackson\u2019s arm and turned her attention back to Talia.\nAfter making sure Stiles and Jackson had safely gone back, Robert had joined Laura and Derek in fighting the two men trying to set the house on fire. They had been moderately successful, but part of the house had been singed in the process.\nJust then, the wolves heard a car approaching. \n\u201cOh!\u201d said Derek with an unreadable look on his face.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Stiles asked impatiently, nudging Derek\u2019s knee with his own. \u201cWho is it?\u201d\nThe door opened to reveal a very much alive Peter. \nStiles sighed in relief and met the man and the door. \u201cDammit, I never thought I\u2019d be glad to see you.\u201d He gave the man a cursory hug. \u201cWhat do you remember?\u201d\nPeter eyed him with veiled fondness. \u201cAlmost everything. I was a little confused at first, but this one helped fill me in when he showed up at my place.\u201d He pointed his thumb over his shoulder at Chris, who was walking up the porch steps.\n\u201cChris,\u201d Stiles exclaimed happily. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re ok.\u201d\n\u201cMore than ok,\u201d the man said, beaming. He looked back towards the car. Stiles saw the back door open, but couldn\u2019t see who was getting out through the glare from the sun. \nWhen he was able to make out the figure walking towards him, Stiles gasped.\n\u201cAllison.\u201d\nOver the next few hours, the rest of the Hales made their way to the house. Derek and Cora, who had to everyone\u2019s surprise arrived with Isaac, reunited happily with their little brothers, Brian and Andrew, along with their grandparents, two aunts, and two younger cousins. \nThe house felt more alive than it ever had. Derek\u2019s cousins were playing tag out back with Brian and Andrew, Aunt Sharon was in the kitchen with Robert cooking a feast fit for kings, and the rest of the pack was squished into the living room basking in the feeling of everything falling into place.\nPeter and Chris were sharing an armchair next to the fireplace, completely lost in their own world. Cora and Isaac were seated on a couch with Allison and Scott, who had come rushing to the Hale house after hearing of Allison\u2019s return. The two couples were happy beyond words, content to just be near one another.\nJohn and Melissa, who had both been summoned for dinner, were standing against the wall, smiling at all their children looking so happy.\nLydia, Laura, Erica, and Boyd occupied the couch across the room by the wall of glass windows looking out over the backyard. Jackson was seated on the floor between Lydia and Laura\u2019s legs.\nIt didn\u2019t escape Stiles\u2019 notice that the rest of the pack had left the loveseat for him and Derek. Nor did he miss the blush that trailed down Derek\u2019s neck when they sat down.\nStiles, throwing caution to the wind, simply huffed once and scooted over so they were flush against each other. Derek stiffened up initially, but ever so slowly relaxed and raised his arm to wrap it protectively around Stiles\u2019 shoulder.\nIsaac said something under his breath at that, causing Derek to growl half heartedly. Isaac raised his hands innocently, but the two shared a soft smile. \nTalia returned from the library where she had been speaking with Kane and Deaton. She took one look at the pack happily engaged in conversation and grinned.\n\u201cOk everyone,\u201d she said at a normal volume. All talking ceased immediately. \u201cThe good news is, it seems as though this arrangement is permanent. Kane has walked me through everything. If you would like to know more about our situation, either he or I will be happy to share that information with you. For now, however, we celebrate.\u201d\nAs if on cue, Derek, Cora, and Laura stood up to begin setting the table. \nDinner was a marvelous affair, full of laughter and way too much food. At one point towards the end, Stiles became overwhelmed by how happy he was, and had to close his eyes and take a few deep breaths.\nA hand grasped his tightly under the table. Without opening his eyes, he turned his hand in Derek\u2019s and interlocked their fingers. Derek pulled their hands onto his lap where they remained for the rest of the meal.\nAfter enveloping Allison in a tight hug, Chris left with Peter for Peter\u2019s apartment. John and Melissa left soon after, followed by the rest of the extended Hale family. Scott and Allison left with Melissa after convincing her to let Allison stay the night at the McCall house. \nRobert went upstairs to tuck Brian and Andrew into bed while Boyd, Erica, Cora, and Isaac attended to the dishes. Deaton, Kane, and Talia disappeared back into the library to discuss a ritual they would need to perform on the flourishing Nemeton later that night.\nLydia, Jackson, and Laura went into the basement to pull out some games for the pack to play once the dishes were done, leaving Stiles and Derek alone at the table.\n\u201cWill you take a walk with me?\u201d Derek asked Stiles softly.\n\u201c\u2019Course.\u201d Without letting go of Derek\u2019s hand, Stiles led him out back to a well-worn path. There was enough light from the moon that he could see perfectly.\nThey walked hand-in-hand for about five minutes, until they were sure they were out of earshot from the house. Stiles had wanted to fill the silence so badly while they walked he was almost vibrating with energy, but he could tell Derek was working his way up to saying something.\nDerek took a deep breath and grabbed Stiles\u2019 other hand. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to think of a way to say thank you that doesn\u2019t seem insufficient.\u201d He huffed a laugh and looked up to meet Stiles\u2019 eyes. \u201cYou brought my family back to me. How do I thank someone for giving me my whole life back?\u201d\nStiles just shook his head. \u201cDerek, you don\u2019t have to thank me for that. There is no one in the world who deserves to be happy more than you.\u201d\nDerek cocked his head to the side to listen to Stiles\u2019 heartbeat. \u201cYou really believe that, don\u2019t you,\u201d he whispered.\n\u201cI do.\u201d\nDerek let go of Stiles\u2019 hands and pulled him into a comforting embrace. Stiles reciprocated immediately, wrapping his arms around Derek\u2019s waist. They closed their eyes and held each other contently for what could have been hours but was probably only a few minutes.\nWhen Derek started to pull away, Stiles tightened his grip so he didn\u2019t go far. Their noses touched and Stiles could see the hunger in Derek\u2019s eyes.\nStiles\u2019 heartbeat skyrocketed as he leaned forward and pressed his lips to Derek\u2019s. Just a gentle pressure, but it sent sparks through Stiles\u2019 whole body. His breath caught in his chest and he opened his mouth to take in air. Derek used the opportunity to deepen the kiss, grounding himself with one hand in Stiles\u2019 hair and the other on the small of his back.\nStiles had expected his mind to race with thoughts, concerns, and insecurities, but it was quiet. Kissing Derek felt like the most right thing Stiles had ever done in his life.\nThey pulled back panting. Stiles\u2019 eyes opened slowly and found Derek\u2019s glowing. He reached up and ran his fingertips over Derek\u2019s eyebrow and around to his cheekbone before letting his hand drop.\nDerek was helpless to do anything but grin goofily. He let out an ecstatic bark of a laugh and pulled Stiles in for another joy-filled kiss. \nUnaccustomed to seeing Derek so happy, Stiles vowed to himself to do everything he could for the rest of his life to keep that smile on Derek\u2019s face.\nStiles chuckled and grabbed Derek\u2019s hand, steering him back towards the house. \u201cThat is so not how I saw that going.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cI was picturing our first kiss more as a \u2018me kissing you then running away in shame when you didn\u2019t kiss me back\u2019 kind of thing.\u201d\nDerek pulled Stiles to a stop and frowned. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I kiss you back?\u201d he asked, as if that was the most ridiculous idea in the world.\nStiles shrugged. \u201cI just never knew you felt that way about me.\u201d\nDerek rolled his eyes and started walking again, pulling Stiles by the hand until he joined him. \u201cStiles, I spent most of my time with you after the Nogitsune.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but I thought that was just a pack thing \u2013 like providing for a weak pack member or something.\u201d\n\u201cI let you pick the movie every night.\u201d\n\u201cBecause your taste in movies is awful, so I had no choice but to take over.\u201d\n\u201cI let you stay at my loft whenever your dad was on the night shift.\u201d\n\u201cI just thought you were taking pity on me!\u201d\n\u201cStiles, you slept in my bed.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have a spare room!\u201d\nDerek looked towards the sky for patience. After a moment of silence he decided to try a different route. \u201cI\u2019d like to get you back to that bed.\u201d\nStiles, oblivious as always, pouted. \u201cBut I\u2019m not tired.\u201d\nDerek leaned in so his mouth was barely touching the shell of Stiles\u2019 ear. \u201cI didn\u2019t say we were going to sleep.\u201d\nStiles stumbled on a branch perfectly illuminated by moonlight. He made a small sound of surprise and sped up.\nDerek laughed and kept pace. \u201cWe still have to stay for game night, though.\u201d\n\u201cOne game,\u201d Stiles declared. \nThey entered the house through the back door and found Lydia, Jackson, Erica, Boyd, Laura, Cora, and Isaac setting up a game on the cleared kitchen table.\n\u201cMonopoly,\u201d Stiles groaned. \u201cThat\u2019s gonna take forever.\u201d\nDerek smiled and kissed his temple, leading them to two empty seats next to each other.\n\u201cOh, no,\u201d Erica said. \u201cYou two sit together and we\u2019ll never finish this game. You\u2019ll be making eyes at each other all night.\u201d\n\u201cCome here, Bambi,\u201d Laura commanded, pulling out a chair between her and Jackson.\nBoyd just laughed under his breath and nodded at the seat next to him for Derek.\nThe two tried half-heartedly to argue, but Lydia stopped them both with a look.\nThey settled for a short kiss before parting for opposite ends of the table. There were some wolf whistles (Laura, Erica, and Cora), and some fake gags (Isaac and Jackson), but Stiles and Derek were too happy to care.\nIn the end, the separation was moot \u2013 they made eyes at each other the whole game anyway."
