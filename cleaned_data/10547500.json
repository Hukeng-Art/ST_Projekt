    "text": "\u201c\u2026as much as I appreciate your efforts,\u201d Regulus said, very little inflection in his voice as he stabbed at a bit of chicken on his plate, \u201cI\u2019m afraid you can\u2019t arrange a marriage for me. I\u2019m dating someone.\u201d\nSirius glanced across the table at him, one eyebrow quirked\u2014almost daring in a way, as if to say, \u2018Oh yes, little brother? Your moment to rebel?\u2019\nIt made sense, as Sirius had been taking the piss about Regulus not doing a single thing that would upset his parents. Regulus had argued there had been no need, but Sirius\u2014as Sirius was wont to do\u2014was relentless about it until Regulus had grabbed him by the front of his robes and said, \u201cJust you watch!\u201d\nSirius, of course, didn\u2019t think Regulus claiming he was dating some fussy Slytherin pureblood wasn\u2019t exactly rebelling. Whichever bird he was laying claim to was probably already on his parents\u2019 list.\n\u201cThis is\u2026the first we\u2019ve heard of it,\u201d Walburga said. She cast a quick side-eye at Sirius as though her eldest had put Regulus up to this which\u2026well in a way, he had. \u201cWho is she?\u201d\nRegulus blinked, a bit owlish and faux innocent which made Sirius want to gag.\n\u201cYes, Regs,\u201d Sirius added sweetly, folding his hands under his chin. \u201cWho is she?\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Regulus said, slow and a bit sly with a hint of a smirk playing at his lips. \u201cYou know him.\u201d\nThere was a pointed silence, and the tiniest cough from Orion, who followed it up by dabbing the corners of his mouth.\n\u201cDo we?\u201d Walburga eventually managed. Her jaw was tense, but Sirius knew she was trying to console herself with the fact that children were not off the table entirely, and at least her baby boy was a Slytherin so chances were it was someone they could tolerate.\n\u201cThe Potters. James Potter,\u201d Regulus deadpanned.\nIf only Sirius hadn\u2019t chosen a moment to take a sip from his goblet. But he had. And pumpkin juice went spraying across his mother\u2019s finest linen, staining a faint orange.\nRegulus still hadn\u2019t blinked.\nWalburga\u2019s already pale face managed to go paler, a bit green as she swallowed and her eyes darted to Orion who was covering a half-smile with the edge of his goblet. He took a moment to compose himself as Sirius gaped like a fish and Walburga was waiting for Sirius\u2019 mates to jump out of the walls and shout, \u201cApril Fools!\u201d\nRegulus heaved a sigh. \u201cThe heart wants what the heart wants.\u201d\nSirius blinked.\nWalburga made a strange noise, like a dying kneazle.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Orion said after the pointed silence, \u201cat least he\u2019s a pureblood?\u201d\n*** \nIn the corridor, Sirius paused to listen to his mother\u2019s wailing before grabbing Regulus by the collar, hauling him into his room. He fought back the urge to hex the little grin off Regulus\u2019 face before crowding him up against the wall, finger pointed into Regulus\u2019 nose.\n\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re playing at?\u201d\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Regulus said, shrugging. \u201cI\u2019m not playing at anything. They asked, I told them.\u201d\n\u201cYou and James are not dating.\u201d\nRegulus blinked innocently. \u201cSays who?\u201d\n\u201cJames, for one!\u201d Sirius howled, stepping back from his sibling. \u201cHe\u2019s going to lose his mind the moment he hears about this rubbish. I swear to Merlin he\u2019s going to hex you from now until the end of the world if he\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIs he?\u201d Regulus asked. His voice was so quiet, so small, so bloody sure that Sirius actually paused in his ranting. Staring at the look on Regulus\u2019 face, Sirius scrambled over to his bed, diving into his trunk for his mirror.\nSeveral books and Moony\u2019s jumpers went flying until he came out with a triumphant, \u201cAHA!\u201d and held the mirror in his hand. He tapped it, and said, \u201cProngs,\u201d and waited, pacing the floor until James\u2019 face appeared.\n\u201cPads?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll never believe this, Prongs,\u201d Sirius said, his hand flailing in the air. \u201cYou will never believe what my brother told my parents tonight at dinner.\u201d\nJames blinked, then said, \u201cAh. Came clean about us dating, did he?\u201d\nSirius froze, like he\u2019d been hit with a petrificus totalus\u2014apart from the shaking in his hands. \u201cYou. He. I.\u201d He swallowed. \u201cWhat?\u201d\nJames\u2019 smile was soft, and so genuine Sirius started to panic as he said, \u201cDating? He didn\u2019t want to tell anyone, of course. Being that it would probably upset you, but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cProngs,\u201d Sirius said, his voice barely above a whisper. He cleared his throat and tried again. \u201cProngs. Are you\u2026are you tell\u2026\u201d His voice cracked and he glanced up to see Regulus watching with careful, narrowed eyes. \u201cAre you telling me that Lily fucks off to go shag Marlene and you decide\u2026you decide to date Regulus?\u201d\n\u201cThe heart wants what the heart wants, Pads,\u201d James said.\nSirius\u2019 gaze snapped up to his brother who gave an agreeing shrug. \u201cYou\u2019re lying. You\u2019re\u2026you\u2019re both lying. Your taking the fucking piss and I will not\u2026I will not stand for this. I will not stand here and listen to this rubbish, this\u2026this utter and absolute\u2026this\u2026\u201d\n\u201cPadfoot,\u201d James said quietly.\nSirius blinked at his friend, then at his brother, then ended the spell. The mirror went blank, and he dropped it to the bed. \u201cI will find out the truth,\u201d he hissed.\nRegulus shrugged. \u201cYou already have. I\u2019ll be here when you\u2019re ready to accept it.\u201d\n*** \nSirius didn\u2019t speak to James again until the end of the hols. He didn\u2019t answer his mirror, or so much as look across the table at Regulus who sat every meal with a smirk on his face. Sirius lurked outside of Regulus\u2019 rooms during the final days, trying to intercept owls with letters to James, but he was so traumatised by the lovey-dovey rubbish in the one he\u2019d managed to catch he decided it wasn\u2019t worth it.\nJames was a determined prankster, and it was clear Regulus had inherited some of the decent genes from Sirius. He\u2019d have to be more clever in breaking them.\nSirius managed to duck away from his parents and brother on the platform, and pushed his way through the crowd until he found Remus talking with Peter and his parents near the luggage compartment. Sirius ducked his head low, came up behind Moony, and grabbed him by the arm.\n\u201cNice to see you, Wormtail! Moony and I have some business to attend to!\u201d\n\u201cSirius what the bloody hell\u2026\u201d Remus spluttered as Sirius dragged him onto the train, into an empty compartment, and spelled the door shut. \u201cWhat are you doing? I told you we are not having sex\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t for shagging, Moons,\u201d Sirius said, then stopped and narrowed his eyes. \u201cAlthough honestly I feel like we\u2019re missing a prime opportunity here to\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSirius,\u201d Remus said, crossing his arms over his chest. His brown eyes were narrowed, his mouth set in a firm line. \u201cWhat the bloody hell is going on?\u201d\n\u201cRegulus said he\u2019s dating James.\u201d Sirius locked eyes with Remus, who stared back, and when the corners of his lips began to twitch, Sirius threw his hands up. \u201cI\u2019m not joking, Remus! Regulus told my parents at dinner,\u201d he spat, \u201cand then when I tried to catch him at the lie\u2026James\u2026James agreed with him!\u201d\nRemus\u2019 smile faded. \u201cDid he? You know he\u2019s probably taking the piss, right?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I know that,\u201d Sirius wailed. \u201cThat\u2019s beside the point, Remus. He\u2019s\u2026lying to me. About dating my brother. Regulus,\u201d he said, grabbing the sides of his head. \u201cThis is literally the worst thing that has ever happened in possibly the entire world.\u201d\nRemus snorted, putting his hand on Sirius\u2019 back, easing him to the seat. \u201cPads. I think there have been worse things than a younger sibling dating a friend.\u201d When Sirius\u2019 head snapped up to glare, Remus poked the end of Sirius\u2019 nose. \u201cBut I still think he\u2019s lying.\u201d\n\u201cI know he\u2019s lying. He\u2019s just trying to get back at me for\u2026something.\u201d\nRemus\u2019 brows furrowed. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d\n\u201cNothing!\u201d Sirius immediately protested. \u201cI mean\u2026nothing I can think of. I love James most in the world apart from you, Moons. And if\u2026bloody hell if he wanted to date Regs\u2026\u201d He shuddered. \u201cBut this is\u2026it has to be crossing a line, right? He\u2019s not using Regs to get over Lils.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think James was\u2026was under Lils,\u201d Remus pointed out. \u201cNot really, anyway. I think he was fixated on the idea of her, you know? He wasn\u2019t even that upset when she started dating Marls.\u201d\nSirius worried his bottom lip between his teeth. \u201cYou\u2019ll help me break them?\u201d\nRemus sighed. \u201cYeah, Pads.\u201d\nJust then, the train gave a lurch, and it started forward. Sirius knew they ought to go find their mates, get on with the ride\u2014possibly buy some sweets, maybe attempt to climb on the roof and dodge the trolley witch\u2026business as usual. But Remus\u2019 arms had come round him tight, soft and soothing. And he was feeling fragile.\nHe turned his face, nuzzling into Remus\u2019 neck, and heard his boyfriend chuckle softly. \u201cI\u2019m not joking about no shagging on the train, Pads.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Sirius said with a pout. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t say anything about no snogging and I need a kiss, Moony.\u201d\nRemus laughed, but cupped Sirius\u2019 chin in his hands, and drew their lips together.\nFor just a little while, Sirius managed to forget about the issue that was his best friend, and his little brother.\n*** \nJames found himself sat near the Slytherin part of the train, uncomfortable to say the least. But their compartment was empty apart from him and Regulus, and Regulus had cast a clever charm on the windows to obscure the view.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re worried about taking too long,\u201d Regulus said with a wave of his hand, \u201cjust tell them all we were snogging.\u201d\nJames rolled his eyes, but held out his hand. Regulus stared for a minute, horror on his face until he realised what James was asking for. Digging into his pockets, he produced a small handful of sickles and galleons.\n\u201cDunno what you need the money for. I\u2019ve seen your family\u2019s vault. It\u2019s near ours,\u201d he sneered.\n\u201cYes well, this is for a good cause,\u201d James said, pocketing the coin.\nRegulus raised a brow. \u201cIs it?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s also a secret,\u201d James told him. And it was. He hadn\u2019t even told the others about it, and didn\u2019t plan to until he had everything solid. He\u2019d been trying to come up with a way to work it all out when Regulus had owled, and it was just too good an opportunity to pass up.\nWhat was a little hand-holding in front of Sirius to make him squirm?\nNot like James hadn\u2019t gone on dates with boys before, and Regulus wasn\u2019t terrible looking. Especially when he was hurtling round the pitch on his broom after the snitch and\u2026\nJames shook himself out of that before things got\u2026awkward. He cleared his throat. \u201cAlright so. D\u2019you want to come and sit with us?\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Regulus said slowly, \u201cyou could always sit with me and my housemates?\u201d\nJames pulled a face. \u201cI\u2019m not sitting with Slytherins. Snape\u2019s in that compartment.\u201d\nRegulus sighed, clearly not going to argue. \u201cYou don\u2019t think I\u2019m really going to open myself up to all the hexing just because you don\u2019t want to smell that greasy git?\u201d\nJames snorted, and took a step in close to Regulus. He saw the high blush on his cheeks, and wondered if Regulus had actually ever had a proper boyfriend or girlfriend before. It wasn\u2019t the time to ask, but he could use this to his advantage.\n\u201cMy friends won\u2019t hurt you,\u201d he said, pitching his voice low. \u201cAnd if you really want to sell this\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want the whole bloody school to know,\u201d Regulus snapped, his voice a bit hoarse.\nJames sighed. \u201cSo tell them you\u2019ve got business with your brother. We\u2019ll have a few sweets, play a game of snap, then you can fuck off back to your friends and we\u2019ll call it a day.\u201d\nRegulus bit his lip. \u201cHow long are we carrying this on for, anyway?\u201d\nJames took a step back, shrugging. \u201cYour call, mate. Pay me, and I\u2019ll be the best boyfriend in the world.\u201d\nRegulus pinked even further. \u201cI erm\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOr we can just tell him the truth now.\u201d\nWith a scowl, Regulus shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not letting him have that triumph. We won\u2019t be telling him anything, not until he believes we\u2019re together. Honestly believes it.\u201d\n\u201cYou realise how stubborn he is, right?\u201d James countered.\nRegulus huffed. \u201cWhich is why I chose you. You\u2019re even more pig-headed than he is.\u201d\nAt that, James threw his head back and laughed, and Regulus seemed startled by it as though maybe he expected James to hit him or curse him. \u201cI suppose that\u2019s true, innit? Well\u2026I guess we\u2019ll give it a try, won\u2019t we?\u201d\n\u201cI guess we will.\u201d Regulus hesitated, then stepped forward, and tangled their hands together.\nJames only barely managed to contain a hitch in his breath as warm palm pressed to warm palm. Regulus\u2019 hands were just a little smaller, and fit almost perfect inside his own. Better than Lily\u2019s ever had, a traitorous voice in the back of his mind said.\nHe told it promptly to fuck off.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going out there like this, then?\u201d he asked, waggling Regulus\u2019 arm.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Regulus snapped. \u201cIt\u2019s only\u2026I wanted to see how it would feel. If I could\u2026stand touching you, is all.\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d James said.\nRegulus rolled his eyes and snatched his hand back. \u201cAt any rate, I only want your mates fooled. I\u2019d rather not have all of Slytherin house thinking I\u2019m shagging King Gryffindor behind tapestries.\u201d\nJames grinned happily. \u201cIs that what your house calls me? King Gryffindor?\u201d\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d Regulus groaned. \u201cYou are\u2026absurd. Anyway can we please get this over with? I\u2019m already regretting every choice I ever made which led me here today.\u201d\nJames snickered, then held the compartment door open and stepped to the side. \u201cAfter you, love.\u201d\nRegulus glared. \u201cI hate you.\u201d\nJames winked as he followed him down the corridor. \u201cYes, but for now, you also love me.\u201d\nIt was the second most awkward train ride to Hogwarts James had ever experienced, if he wanted to count sixth year and the pants incident in Potions. But really he didn\u2019t want to think of that ever, so he\u2019d rather just go with most awkward.\nHe and Regulus were near the window, his arm loosely round the younger Black. Sirius and Remus sat across from them, Remus looking befuddled, Sirius looking mutinous. There were a pile of sweets between their feet, and a game of snap which never got started. Both Peter and Lily sat near the door, Peter looking the most confused of all of them, and Lily on the edge of her seat like she was unsure whether or not she should be present for any of this.\nJames hadn\u2019t dared look at Regulus just yet.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Lily said, breaking the strained silence, \u201ccongratulations you two.\u201d\nJames\u2019 face instantly went soft as he beamed at her. She truly was a good person, and he did love her. \u201cThanks, Lils. I\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t congratulate him,\u201d Sirius interrupted, leaning forward in his seat. James could see Remus hook fingers into Sirius\u2019 robes, holding him back. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious they\u2019re lying.\u201d\nLily\u2019s brows rose. \u201cIs it?\u201d\nIf James had thought the silence had been thick before, it was nothing compared to how it was now. He glanced at Peter who\u2019d made a sort of aborted noise, then said, \u201cYou\u2026think Prongs and Regulus were\u2026going to happen?\u201d\nLily shrugged. \u201cWell, I mean\u2026it makes sense.\u201d\n\u201cHow the bloody hell,\u201d Sirius demanded through clenched teeth, \u201cdoes it make sense?\u201d\nLily sat back, a tiny smile playing at her lips and James wasn\u2019t sure if she was taking the piss now, or if she meant it. If it was the former, he was realising they\u2019d missed out on having another clever mind added to years\u2019 of potentially wasted pranks.\n\u201cI mean, he\u2019s not going to fall in love with you,\u201d she said to Sirius.\n\u201cRude,\u201d he shot back.\nLily shrugged. \u201cAnd Regulus plays Quidditch which should have been your first clue.\u201d\nAt that, James felt his cheeks heat up, and he didn\u2019t miss the faint rise of colour in Regulus\u2019 cheeks. \u201cOh come on, I\u2019m not\u2026\u201d\n\u201cApart from me,\u201d Lily challenged, \u201cwho have you dated or at the very least had a couple of dark corridor snogs with who wasn\u2019t on a house team?\u201d\nWell\u2026she had him there. \u201cYeah, but I mean\u2026it\u2019s not a requirement,\u201d James finished lamely.\nShe snorted. \u201cSure, Potter. But Regulus is also clever, and nice when he wants to be, but not too nice. Gives better than he gets if he can be bothered. Not bad looking, either.\u201d\nJames watched Regulus\u2019 face turn pinker and pinker, and he thought maybe if it weren\u2019t for the iron grip he had on the Slytherin, he might have run away. Instead he was forced to endure the scrutiny and attention he hated so much. But\u2026well. It was Regulus\u2019 choice. He was the one who insisted.\n\u201cSee,\u201d James said after a moment. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious, and if you\u2019d take your face away from Moony\u2019s face long enough to notice other people\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIs that what this is?\u201d Sirius drawled, crossing his arms as he flung himself back, nearly knocking Remus in the chest with his elbow. \u201cYou\u2019re cross because I haven\u2019t been paying you enough attention? So you want to fake snog my brother\u2026\u201d\n\"Not everything is about you,\" James said with a huff. \"He and I are interested in each other.\" When Sirius' expression remained unmoving, full of challenge, James said, \"We can make a bet on it. Anything you like.\"\nSirius' eyes glinted. \"Fine. If I can prove the two of you aren't dating, I get whatever you've been hoarding away in that little sack of yours in your trunk.\"\nJames tried not to grin triumphantly, forcing a look of irritation and mild horror on his face. \"F-fine,\" he said. \"Fine. Because this isn't a prank.\" He gripped Regulus a litlte tighter.\n\u201cAnd anyway, James isn\u2019t going to date a Slytherin to get back at you,\u201d Peter added helpfully. \u201cIf anything he\u2019d go for Dori. Or me.\u201d\nJames blinked at him, barely managing to hide a chuckle. He didn\u2019t dare look over at Evans who he was certain now was on to the whole thing. \u201cEvans, isn\u2019t McKinnon expecting you?\u201d\n\u201cShe is,\u201d Lily said. \u201cI just had to see what the fuss was about.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll walk you,\u201d he said helpfully. \u201cI mean, we have Head business to discuss anyway.\u201d\nThere was a vague protest by both Black brothers, but with a firm glower, they stayed put and James followed Lily into the corridor.\nJust as he was about to open his mouth and ask how she figured it out, she turned to him. \u201cYou\u2019re cute together, you two. I think you\u2019d be good for him.\u201d\nJames deflated. There was a small part of him disappointed he\u2019d managed to fool even her. He knew he could convince her to keep her mouth shut, if only to upset Sirius, and he\u2019d wanted someone to confide in.\n\u201cErm. Well. Thanks,\u201d he muttered.\nShe snorted. \u201cHe\u2019s going to figure it out eventually, though. I just hope you two get sorted first.\u201d\nJames blinked at her, trying to process what she\u2019d said. \u201cSo you know\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThat you two aren\u2019t dating?\u201d she offered, and shook her head. \u201cPotter, you know I\u2019m not an idiot.\u201d\n\u201cYes well, Sirius is as clever as they come\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAnd he knows you\u2019re full of shit,\u201d she replied. \u201cI\u2019m just waiting to see who will hold out longer. Anyway, I ought to get back to\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHang on,\u201d he said, and tugged on her robe. \u201cWhat did you mean get sorted first?\u201d\nShe sighed, reaching out to give him a pat on the cheek. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll figure it out, James. You did with me, in the end. I suppose\u2026it\u2019s Regulus I worry most about, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\nThen she was gone, and James was left in the corridor, more confused than ever before.\n*** \n\u201cYou know, they might not actually be lying,\u201d Peter said as they headed back to the Gryffindor Tower. James and Lily, along with the other Prefects, had been called to a meeting. Which meant Regulus was with them as well.\nSirius scowled at his friend. \u201cYou can\u2019t seriously believe that. Wormtail\u2026you\u2026you have known James seven bloody years. You know this isn\u2019t real!\u201d\n\u201cI dunno,\u201d Remus said quietly, making Sirius freeze in his footsteps. \u201cI\u2019m not saying you\u2019re wrong, Pads. I\u2019m just saying\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDo not. Do not betray me, Moony. My heart is small and fragile and I cannot take my every mate, the love of my life betraying me right now.\u201d\nRemus rolled his eyes, but pulled Sirius in for a kiss as Peter huffed and elbowed past them. The portrait open, then swung shut, and Sirius let Remus crowd him into a secluded corner. The kisses lasted just a little while, and then Remus pulled back and cupped his face.\n\u201cYou want me to ask Dumbledore if he can reinstate me? Then I can get proper intel?\u201d\nSirius sighed, but grinned at his boyfriend and tugged at one of Remus\u2019 curls. \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful, but no. I know it was too much stress for you with the moons and everything. Honestly it\u2019s just\u2026it feels like the joke has carried on a bit far.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if\u2026\u201d\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t say it\u2019s not a joke,\u201d Sirius said. \u201cBecause it meant Jamie didn\u2019t bother to tell me he fancied my brother. It means he was sneaking round with Regs for\u2026Merlin only knows how long and didn\u2019t say a word.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s worse?\u201d Remus prodded. \u201cJames lying to you for a prank, or lying about who he fancies?\u201d Remus bit his bottom lip, then brought up the words Sirius really didn\u2019t want to hear, \u201cBecause you know we hid us from him for nearly a full year.\u201d\nSirius groaned, dropping his forehead against Remus\u2019 collarbone and sighed at him several times in a row. \u201cIt\u2019s different with us, okay? Because we were mates, you know. Like anything that could upset the dynamic of the group\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you told him when he started dating Lily,\u201d Remus pointed out.\n\u201cI was young and na\u00efve then,\u201d Sirius muttered.\n\u201cSix months ago?\u201d Remus asked with a laugh. \u201cReally\u2026I know you and Regulus don\u2019t see eye to eye all the time but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cRemus,\u201d Sirius said, and pulled back, \u201che\u2019s\u2026like them. Like my parents. He\u2026he probably wants to rebel, but he\u2019d only do it with a pureblood because he knows he can get away with it.\u201d Things started to churn in Sirius\u2019 head. \u201cAnd that, my darling Moony, is going to be their undoing!\u201d\nRemus looked a bit dubious as Sirius tore away from him and bolted down the corridor. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\n\u201cTo put an end to this. Their way!\u201d\n*** \nWhat was a bit of hand holding, eh? Regulus\u2019 hands were nice, and softer than James would expect from a Seeker. He was shorter than James, which he quite fancied, and he truly wasn\u2019t bad to look at. And since they only had to keep the ruse up for Sirius\u2019 sake, they didn\u2019t have to be overtly public about it.\nReally, things were working out quite nicely.\nThey hadn\u2019t had to fake a snog yet, and Sirius had stopped pestering James.\nJames was, in fact, having a lovely breakfast at the Gryffindor table, exchanging looks with Regulus across the Hall when the mail came in. It was a bit early, and James was startled to see his parents\u2019 tawny brown swooping round them, but it wasn\u2019t unlikely he\u2019d forgotten something over the hols.\nOnly\u2026it dropped a letter. It wasn\u2019t Howler red, thank god, but neither of his parents were really in the habit of writing notes these days. He was a seventh year, after all, he didn\u2019t need checking in on. But he recognised his father\u2019s untidy scrawl on the front, and he offered Mani a bit of juice before he flew off.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Sirius asked, his mouth stuffed full of beans and toast.\nJames rolled his eyes. \u201cNo idea.\u201d He pulled at the seal and stared down at the words. It took him a moment to process what it said, but when he did, his gaze snapped up to Sirius who was smirking in triumph.\n\u201cYou\u2026didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t what?\u201d Sirius asked, clasping his hands under his chin. \u201cOh, you mean I didn\u2019t write to mummy and daddy and tell them that you and Regulus seemed like you were maybe getting\u2026serious,\u201d he smirked at his own tired, old pun. \u201cThat maybe the families ought to meet and talk this over before the pair of you made any rash decisions.\u201d\n\u201cWe were keeping this private, Sirius,\u201d James growled.\n\u201cWell you\u2019re so in love,\u201d Sirius shot back, \u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d mind who knew. I mean, you shouted bloody sonnets at Evans over dinner all last year so\u2026if you think I\u2019m going to let you treat my darling brother worse than her\u2026\u201d\nJames took a breath, his head spinning, but he pocketed the letter and stood up. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he said, and Sirius clamped his mouth shut. James darted a look at Peter and Remus who were determinedly staring down at their breakfast plates. \u201cI should be declaring my love publicly. And I wasn\u2019t going to tell you yet but I might as well now since I have to address it with my parents,\u201d he all-but sneered. \u201cBut since I\u2019m going to ask Regulus to move in with me over the summer, maybe it\u2019s a good time for our families to\u2026meet.\u201d\nSirius\u2019 grey eyes blinked at James. \u201cI\u2026but you and I meant to\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWell I reckoned you and Moony had changed those plans,\u201d James said plainly, not meaning that at all because he knew it wasn\u2019t true. But he was not letting Sirius get the best of him. He wasn\u2019t the only one in this little arrangement determined to be more stubborn than Sirius was. \u201cAnyway, I should chat with Regulus first. Since you didn\u2019t give me a chance before arranging all\u2026this.\u201d\nWith that, James spun on his heel, marched to the Slytherin table where Regulus was watching, pink-cheeked, and held out his hand. \u201cA word?\u201d\nRegulus spluttered. \u201cErm\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s important,\u201d James said. When Regulus rose, James tugged him close and whispered in his ear, \u201cSorry about this, but I haven\u2019t a choice. Unless you want to give this bet up now.\u201d\nRegulus gave the most minute shake of his head, and then turned his head and brushed his lips over James\u2019. There was a collective hush, but James ignored the all, and ignored the furious blush in his cheeks, as he dragged Regulus from the hall.\n*** \nIt was sorted. James was exhausted trying to manage classes\u2014not sitting with his mates was enough to drive him a bit spare\u2014and how he was going to handle his parents. They seemed...less than thrilled, but more confused than anything, and yet maybe not even that since he was James Potter and he didn\u2019t do things ordinary or by halves.\nRegulus was furious when he\u2019d learnt what Sirius had done, but in the end decided he\u2019d rather endure taunts from his yearmates and well\u2026all of Slytherin really, in order to get one over on Sirius. He even offered James more money, which James refused.\n\u201cIt\u2019s my thick-headed mate that\u2019s got us further in,\u201d James said. \u201cAnd at this point I\u2019d take winning this over getting paid at all.\u201d\nRegulus bit down on his thumbnail, watching a few first years pass by. \u201cWill you tell me what the money\u2019s for after?\u201d\nJames licked his lips, then ruffled his hair. \u201cI\u2026suppose it can\u2019t hurt. Not yet, mind, but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cCuriosity is getting to me,\u201d Regulus admitted, and James was struck, suddenly, with how sweet that sounded. So unlike the Regulus he\u2019d known when he and Sirius had been at each other\u2019s throats.\nJames shuffled his feet a bit. \u201cWhy\u2019re you so determined to convince Sirius we\u2019re a couple? I mean\u2026surely there could have been someone more annoying than I am.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe Evans, but she\u2019s far too into McKinnon now,\u201d Regulus said with a wry grin. \u201cAnd erm. It\u2019s\u2026\u201d He stopped and looked away. James reacted without really thinking, closing his fingers round Regulus\u2019 wrist and tugged at him. Regulus looked back, a bit pained. \u201cIt\u2019s only just\u2026he doesn\u2019t think anyone like you would fancy someone like me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2026someone like me? What do you mean?\u201d James asked.\nRegulus\u2019 blush darkened. \u201cYou. Popular, attractive, good at nearly everything you do without even trying. So good it makes me want to hex things,\u201d Regulus said through gritted teeth. He sighed after a second and relaxed. \u201cAnd I\u2019m just\u2026you know. Me.\u201d\nJames blinked. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026\u201d\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t play daft, Potter,\u201d Regulus insisted. \u201cYou and I both know if you didn\u2019t love winding Sirius up this much, you wouldn\u2019t bother. I mean, you have loads of money, it\u2019s not like you need it.\u201d\nThat was true, yes. But the fact that Regulus thought so low of himself\u2026\n\u201cLily wasn\u2019t lying,\u201d he said quickly. \u201cWhen she said all those things about you. You\u2019re someone who deserves to be fancied. Sirius knows it, too. He\u2026cares. He wants you to be happy. Winding him up is just a\u2026bonus.\u201d\nRegulus stared for a second, then his face relaxed into a rare, genuine smile. \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201d\nJames laughed. \u201cYeah well\u2026everyone knows that.\u201d He dropped his hand from Regulus\u2019 wrist, and ruffled his hair again. \u201cSo. Shall we do this?\u201d\nRegulus shrugged. \u201cFake a big public relationship, then fake a big public split. Can\u2019t be too hard, can it?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d James said, grinning toothy at him. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be that hard at all.\u201d\nJames hadn\u2019t intended on letting his mood get to him, and in all honesty he hadn\u2019t been on the outs with Sirius like this since second year when they fought over who was going to cast the detonation spell on the fireworks they\u2019d put in the Great Hall. But not having night time chats, not having Sirius crawling into his bed when Moony was too warm, or sharing glances in class\u2026\nIt was a lot.\nJames and Sirius were nearly adults and he should be able to handle something like this.\nBut he wasn\u2019t.\nHe stabbed at his eggs, feeling moody and irritated, pointedly not looking over where Sirius was also poking forcefully at his breakfast. It was not the state of mind James wanted to be in before their Quidditch match. He had exactly thirty minutes before he had to be on the pitch, his head in Captain space, and prepared to beat Slytherin.\nWhich, in hindsight, held its own set of problems considering Regulus was on the team and now that they were dating\u2014at least according to the Student and Staff body, people were watching.\nIntently.\nHe sighed and reached for his tea when he heard Peter make a sort of strangled, squeaking noise. James glanced up, and his vision was suddenly full of green and silver Quidditch robes. He blinked, his mouth opened to say something, but the words died on his tongue when a calloused, warm hand fell on his cheek.\n\u201cErm.\u201d\nRegulus gave a pointed look to Sirius who was trying not to look like he was watching. Then he leant down and dragged his lips, slow and easy, across James\u2019. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t tell you good luck today but\u2026good luck, James.\u201d\n\u201cErm.\u201d James blinked rapidly, and was stunned by Regulus\u2019 smirk, and the way he moved in the robes, and the way he squared his shoulders as he walked out.\nThe hall doors slammed, and James was forced back into himself. He glanced over and saw the way Remus and Peter were smirking at him, and his blush rose so fast it made him dizzy. \u201cShut it.\u201d\nRemus snickered. \u201cWe didn\u2019t say anything, Prongs.\u201d\nPeter smiled. \u201cYeah. But you know\u2026good luck.\u201d\n*** \nJames spun in a circle, his hands in his hair tugging almost frantically. He\u2019d been dragged under the bleachers by one flustered Regulus Black, who looked equally as panicked. \u201cThey\u2019re here. How\u2026what\u2026why. Why are they here?\u201d Reaching out, he grabbed Regs by the front of his robes and shook him. \u201cWhy the bloody hell are they here?\u201d\n\u201cYour stupid best mate has done this,\u201d Regulus spat, shoving James\u2019 hand away. \u201cThis is his fault. And by proxy your fault. He would have been a decent, quiet Slytherin if it hadn\u2019t been for you on the train.\u201d\nJames rolled his eyes. \u201cThat is a lie and we both know it. And frankly you know I\u2019ve been good for him. Your parents are terrible and\u2026\u201d\n\u201cCan we not do this right now?\u201d Regulus begged. \u201cWe have to go play a sodding quidditch match, and then pretend to be dating in front of our parents. Who, by the way, are probably trying to arrange our wedding.\u201d He sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. \u201cWhy was I cursed with this family? And you?\u201d\n\u201cWho owled whom, eh?\u201d James asked moodily, kicking at Regulus\u2019 shin. \u201cAnd you could do a lot worse, Black.\u201d\nRegulus looked up with a quirked brow. \u201cYeah. And you\u2019d be fine chained to me the rest of your life, would you? Sharing a marital bed?\u201d\nRegulus clearly meant it to be a dig, but James found the idea\u2026well, rather tingly in his fingers and toes, and he couldn\u2019t do more than flap his mouth open and shut in lieu of answer.\nRegulus rolled his eyes, clearly taking James\u2019 lack of speech for disgust. \u201cExactly. So you\u2019d better get better at convincing my brother that this is all very real so we\u2019re not stuck actually getting married.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d take it that far?\u201d James croaked.\nRegulus raised his brows and crossed his arms over his head. \u201cTry me.\u201d\nThey didn\u2019t have much time to row longer. They were being summoned to the pitch, and James had to get his head out of this mess, and in the match. It would not do to lose in front of the whole school\u2014and his parents\u2014and Black\u2019s parents\u2014all the while pretending to fancy him and date him.\nPretending.\nHe was\u2026pretending.\nHe sighed, and glowered at his team who looked on the verge of taking the piss, and he shouted at them to get ready. He adjusted his googles, gripped his broom, and when the whistle blew, he took off.\n*** \nGryffindor had been favoured to win, and by a stroke of luck and James\u2019 sheer determination, they had. Not to mention Slytherin was working with their reserve Keeper who was only alright. Regulus had missed the snitch by a centimetre, and the whole stadium erupted in cheers as Gryffindor bowled each other over and hugged as the rest of their house stormed the pitch.\nJames caught a glance of Regulus heading off in a sulk with the rest of his team, and he caught a glimpse of the unimpressed faces of Walburga and Orion who were giving a polite golf-clap as the Potters roared and cheered. James had to laugh at that, and even nudged Sirius and nodded at his parents.\nSirius, who was still not thrilled with James, managed a smug grin anyway, and even clapped James on the back.\nIt was the most he\u2019d get for the rest of the evening.\nLunch was tense. James, Regulus, Sirius, the Potters and the Blacks were offered private dining from Dumbledore, and they sat in a pointed silence as they all poked at their food. The House Elves had outdone themselves, with various curries, and several tagine filled with couscous, lamb, chicken, and veg.\nJames was scooping rice, aloo, and saag paneer onto his plate, ignoring the tension, but he glanced up at his father who was grinning over his goblet of pumpkin juice.\n\u201cGood game there, Jamie,\u201d Fleamont said, breaking the silence.\nSirius choked on a swallow of his drink as Walburga\u2019s face managed to go even more sour.\n\u201cThanks,\u201d James said, and cleared his throat. \u201cIt erm\u2026was pretty close.\u201d\n\u201cIt was embarrassing,\u201d Walburga snapped, her eyes narrow on Regulus. \u201cHonestly the money we\u2019ve put into your training and team\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t win them all,\u201d Regulus said in a small voice.\n\u201cWell I expect better than that. It\u2019s really no wonder we don\u2019t bother to show up for more of these. Then again I suppose you\u2019ve had your head\u2026\u201d She glanced over at James with a sneer. \u201cElsewhere.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Effie said with a polite smile, \u201cwe\u2019re happy if they\u2019re happy.\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d Walburga said with a sigh. \u201cI suppose it could be worse. We had Potter here pegged as a muggle-lover, and didn\u2019t expect he\u2019d have eyes for any proper wizard. We\u2019d hoped for a better match for Regulus, but seeing how he is, it\u2019s really the best we can hope for.\u201d\nJames watched Regulus\u2019 cheeks darken, his brow furrow, his shoulders hunch, and he felt his fingers tingle, itching to reach for his wand and test out a few of the new curses he and the boys had been working on. But of course he knew that would go over as well as a Niffler inside Gringotts, so he let out a breath, and stretched his leg under the table until it curled round Regulus\u2019 ankle.\nRegulus startled, but glanced up and gave James an appreciative nod.\n\u201cHonestly, can you save the heavy petting for later?\u201d Walburga snapped. \u201cIt\u2019s bad enough I\u2019m eating\u2026this, surrounded by the smell of half-bloods. But I must watch the two of you paw at each other as well?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve lost my appetite. May I be excused?\u201d Sirius blurted.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Walburga snapped. \u201cI\u2019ve a thing or two to talk to you about. Heard you\u2019ve been consorting with muggle-borns, and I swear you couldn\u2019t sink any lower, but here we are.\u201d\nJames could see the way his parents bristled, the way his father sucked in a breath to say something. He begged silently with his eyes for them to let it go. It would only be worse for Sirius and Regulus if they caused a scene. It ate him up inside, but there it was.\n\u201cDid you see Sirius had top marks last term?\u201d James said. \u201cIn both Charms and Transfigurations.\u201d\n\u201cMm,\u201d Walburga said.\n\u201cWe were very proud,\u201d Fleamont cut in. \u201cVery proud indeed. He\u2019s got a bright future ahead of him. Both these boys do.\u201d\nJames watched a pleased flush mirror each other on the brothers\u2019 faces, and it lasted until Walburga let out a small laugh. \u201cYes. We shall see. Won\u2019t we. I\u2019m suppose I\u2019m glad someone in the world has faith in these two, because they certainly haven\u2019t earnt it in this home.\u201d\nThe mood deflated, and all James could do was keep his foot pressed where it was, and move a little closer to Sirius, to remind them both whatever their mother said, it wasn\u2019t what the rest of the world believed.\n*** \nJames slipped out from under the cloak, glancing down at the map in his hands before stuffing it into his pocket, and slipping through the stable doors. The Thestrals and other creatures Hagrid minded were either sleeping, or out to graze, and the only thing breathing besides James was the small, robe-covered lump curled up at the tall window.\nJames hefted himself up into the massive sill, and edged over until his knee pressed into Regulus\u2019. \u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d\n\u201cConsidering I came out here to be away from people,\u201d Regulus snapped, then sighed and shrugged, moving the hood back from his face. He looked tired, face drawn, mouth in a straight line. \u201cToday was ridiculous. I don\u2019t\u2026I don\u2019t know why I thought this was a good idea at all.\u201d\n\u201cWell I can\u2019t pretend like I know why you blurted out that you and I were dating. Or why you wanted to upset your parents when you never have before\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBecause I never have,\u201d Regulus blurted out. \u201cSirius ran away!\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026he went back,\u201d James said, and closed his eyes against the stinging memory of Sirius packing up his things and going back to a house he knew would crush him. But he also understood why he\u2019d done it. The reason was sat there, next to him, and he didn\u2019t think Regulus had any idea.\n\u201cHe came back because he\u2019s braver than I am,\u201d Regulus admitted after a moment of silence. James blinked at him, startled. \u201cHe\u2026he got a bit pissed the night my parents finally let him out of his room and\u2026he told me. It was stupid. I dunno why he was so worried about me. I could have handled it.\u201d\n\u201cIs that why all this happened?\u201d James asked. He hesitated, but then reached over and offered out his hand. He\u2019d always been a tactile sort of person, and it bothered him not being allowed to give comfort in that way, even if he and Regulus weren\u2019t exactly friends. And even if thinking about it did funny things to his insides.\nRegulus stared down at him for a minute, then sighed and let his palm slide against James\u2019. He didn\u2019t put up any resistance when James tugged him over, and into a firm embrace. Regulus grumbled, but let the side of his face rest against James\u2019 chest.\n\u201cIs this what you force Sirius to put up with?\u201d he groused.\nJames laughed, brushing his hand along Regulus\u2019 hair. \u201cYes. Awful torture, you know. Being comforted and loved.\u201d The words died on his tongue, and he felt Regulus stiffen, but still he didn\u2019t pull away. \u201cAnyway I\u2026I\u2019m sorry your parents are rubbish.\u201d\nRegulus let out a shaking sigh, his eyes drifting closed. \u201cMy dad isn\u2019t so bad. Or well\u2026he is, I guess. I reckon no one knows if he\u2019d be better or worse without my hag of a mother always speaking for the pair of them. I asked Andromeda once, what mother and father were like.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d James asked softly, still stroking along Regulus\u2019 hair, down his back.\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t know. Their marriage had been arranged since they were little, and they were married before she was born.\u201d He let out a breath, shaking slightly, and he shrugged. \u201cThere was a part of me that thought if I made them proud\u2014maybe proud enough for the both of us, me and Sirius\u2014they\u2019d\u2026be better? Like maybe they were just waiting for one of us to live up to their expectations. But\u2026every time I think I\u2019ve got it, they just\u2026pile on more.\u201d\n\u201cMoving target,\u201d James murmured. He tucked Regulus in close.\n\u201cYeah. Moving target. I think that\u2019s\u2026that\u2019s why I owled you. I realised I\u2019d spent my entire life living up to a moving target, and I\u2019d never get there. It was too late for me to be like Sirius. I\u2019m already in Slytherin, already a prefect, my marks are good, I\u2019m a top Seeker. So I did the only thing I could think of\u2026\u201d\n\u201cStarted fake-shagging a blood-traitor,\u201d James said.\nRegulus tensed, then lifted his head and he looked at James with the most sincerity James had ever seen on his face. \u201cYou know I\u2026I don\u2019t actually think that, right? That you\u2019re\u2026that anyone\u2019s a blood traitor.\u201d He licked his lips, then leant in and said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got squibs in our family, you know. Not that you\u2019d ever find out. Their records have been erased. But I heard mother and father talking about a cousin who lives in America doing some sort of\u2026 muggle celebrity thing. Singing, maybe? Dunno, but they sounded like maybe they were happy and I was pretty little when I heard it but it sort of\u2026made me think.\u201d He paused and then said, \u201cAnd I really like Evans. She\u2019s pretty and clever.\u201d\nJames chuckled. \u201cShe\u2019s taken you know.\u201d\nRegulus pinked, and he shoved at James\u2019 shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026I don\u2019t fancy her.\u201d He hesitated, then breathed out and said, \u201cI don\u2019t fancy any girls.\u201d\nJames nudged him back, smiling as he swung his legs over the ledge. \u201cI sort of figured that out. Being that you chose me for your little prank.\u201d He glanced down and realised that their hands were still tangled together, and he gave Regulus\u2019 a squeeze. \u201cFor the record, I\u2019m glad you picked me. And for the record, if you want to leave, you\u2019re just as welcome at mine as Sirius ever was. You\u2019re not going to be alone.\u201d\n\u201cEven if she disinherits me?\u201d Regulus asked, his voice small.\nJames touched his chin, drawing his gaze back up. \u201cI\u2019m rich. Like\u2026absurdly rich. Enough for several people to inherit a small fortune. I think I can handle it. And besides, you\u2019re clever enough, whatever you want to do after school\u2014you\u2019re going to be great at it.\u201d James paused, then let go of Regulus and pushed himself up. \u201cAnd I meant it. You\u2019ll never be alone. Not if you don\u2019t want to be.\u201d\n\u201cAnd even when I do,\u201d Regulus pointed out.\nJames laughed and hopped off the sill, reaching for his cloak and the map to check if the coast was clear. \u201cI reckon so. But I\u2019ll go now. Leave you to your thoughts. You just erm\u2026you just let me know what you want to do.\u201d\nThere was silence, and just before James reached the door he heard Regulus call out, \u201cI don\u2019t think Sirius quite believes us yet. I think we\u2019d better dial it up a bit.\u201d\nJames grinned, and waved, and turned before Regulus could notice the open desire on his face.\nJames woke to the faint smell of cigarette smoke, and he rolled over onto his side, eyes fixed at the window where he could see the silhouette of Sirius leant against the stone wall. The faint glow of the cherry, and the white of the smoke against the dark sky was a familiar sight, but it had been a while since Sirius stayed up at night.\nRemus was in hospital, his aches this close to the moon too much for him to bear, and he\u2019d needed a pain potion to sleep. Sirius had walked him there and back, and hadn\u2019t said much to James since the visit with his parents. James worried\u2014he always worried when it came to the weight Sirius had to bear living in that house, but their relationship was strained.\nIt was his own fault\u2014he knew that. He could solve the problem by just confessing, but he just had to hang on a little longer. He wasn\u2019t going to last, he knew that. His feelings for Regulus were becoming a bit more complicated than he\u2019d anticipated, and he wasn\u2019t sure where to put them, really. For now, stuffing them into a tiny box, in the corner of his mind, was good enough.\nFor now, swinging his feet onto the cold stone floor and shuffling to the window was all he focused on.\nSirius made a disgruntled noise when James hopped up next to him. It was reminiscent of the other night, when James had comforted Regulus in the stables. Only this was more familiar\u2014more comfortable. This was what James had been doing the last seven years, and likely would dedicate the rest of his life to, so long as Sirius needed him.\nHe nudged his friend, and Sirius rolled his eyes, glancing away.\n\u201cMoony fall asleep alright?\u201d\n\u201cRight as he can be. Not that you care much these days,\u201d Sirius bit.\nJames raised a brow at him. \u201cMoony and I are getting on fine, thanks. It\u2019s you who doesn\u2019t seem to want to accept the situation.\u201d\n\u201cSituation,\u201d Sirius said, his voice in a bit of a sneer. \u201cIs that what it is?\u201d\nJames sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you want from me.\u201d\n\u201cThe truth.\u201d Sirius sucked one last drag from the cigarette, and let it tumble down the tower, smearing bits of burning ash on the way down. \u201cYou\u2019ve never lied to me before.\u201d\nJames\u2019 insides twisted and he reminded himself this was a good thing. Sirius would forgive him. \u201cI like your brother.\u201d That wasn\u2019t a lie. It was a bit of something he didn\u2019t want to unpack right then, but it was the truth. \u201cI think he deserves better. Just like you.\u201d\nSirius rolled his eyes up as he let his head fall against the stone. \u201cI\u2019m getting nothing, you know? I mean\u2026I won\u2019t have nothing. I\u2019ll get a job and have a flat and\u2026and it\u2019ll be whatever. But I went back for Regs. I knew they\u2019d cut me out of the will and I don\u2019t\u2026bloody hell I don\u2019t actually care. But he doesn\u2019t care, either. He\u2019s happy to let them shit on me, and whittle him down to nothing, all for what? A vault full of galleons and cursed, dark objects?\u201d\nJames sighed, then pulled Sirius into his arms. Sirius resisted in the way he did when he wanted comfort, but didn\u2019t want to sacrifice his pride. James kept his hold on him, but went lax until Sirius gave up and climbed into the embrace. \u201cI think you should talk to Regulus. I think\u2026he doesn\u2019t want any of that, either.\u201d\n\u201cS\u2019that what he told you? He hoping to marry into the Potter fortune so he doesn\u2019t feel so shite when our parents decide to cut us both off and give everything away to some House Elf oppression league.\u201d\nJames sighed, brushing his fingers through Sirius\u2019 hair. \u201cI don\u2019t think he much cares about the money. I think\u2026I think he wants to feel safe. Like he\u2019s got somewhere to go. It just took him a little longer than you.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s soft,\u201d Sirius complained.\n\u201cHe\u2019s stronger than you give him credit for,\u201d James said. When Sirius stiffened, James cupped his chin and drew his gaze up. \u201cI love you. You are the most important person in my life, and that will never change. Understand? I don\u2019t care what happens between us, or how furious you are at me for whatever ridiculous thing I\u2019ve done. Whatever I feel for Regulus, that\u2019s not going to change this. Just like when you fell in love with Moony. Nothing\u2019s different.\u201d\nSirius licked his lips. \u201cDid you tell him?\u201d\nWith a frown, James leant back a little. \u201cAbout what?\u201d\n\u201cMoony. You love him so much, I assumed you\u2019d\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIf you think I\u2019d betray our most precious secret to anyone\u2026that I\u2019d tell anyone without Remus telling me it was alright\u2026\u201d James couldn\u2019t hide the sting in his voice, and he watched as Sirius\u2019 eyes filled with regret.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYes, you did,\u201d James said. He sighed, and drew Sirius close again. He expected it. He understood why Sirius didn\u2019t trust anyone, why he was looking to always be betrayed. When you had parents like his\u2014parents who were supposed to love you and care for you unconditionally, and never did\u2014it was bound to happen. \u201cIt\u2019s alright. I didn\u2019t tell him. I won\u2019t.\u201d\nSirius said nothing, apart from a small humming noise, and he sagged into James\u2019 arms.\nIt wasn\u2019t better, but James had bought some time, at least.\n*** \n\u201cWhy do you look like your pet goldfish has just died?\u201d\nJames glanced up at Evans who was wearing a tiny smirk, and he sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a goldfish.\u201d\nShe laughed. \u201cRight. Your parents probably bought you a Unicorn or something, didn\u2019t they?\u201d\nJames kicked at her, which she laughed as she dodged. \u201cShut up, Evans. You\u2019ve met my parents. I\u2026might have been spoilt, but they\u2019re not ridiculous.\u201d\nShe laughed again, but sighed fondly. \u201cIt was almost worth dating you just to keep them around. But your mum still writes me every week so I guess I won custody of them after all.\u201d\nJames couldn\u2019t help his own laugh. \u201cShe wanted a dozen children, and when she could only have me, she counted on me being so charming I could pick up strays.\u201d He bit his lip. \u201cNot that erm\u2026that you\u2019re\u2026a stray or anything. I mean\u2026they just like my friends and\u2026\u201d\n\u201cCalm down, boyo,\u201d Lily said, nudging him. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been this ridiculous with your mouth since I agreed to go on a date with you. What\u2019s going on?\u201d\nJames didn\u2019t say anything straight away. They continued their patrol, then started for the doors to begin their rounds of the courtyard. Stepping into the night air, James glanced up at the moon, a day away from being full. A day away from when they\u2019d sneak out and meet Moony, and run the forest.\n\u201cI like Regulus,\u201d he finally said.\nLily snorted. \u201cS\u2019good, isn\u2019t it? That you fancy the person you\u2019re dating. We sort of learnt the hard way about dating when you don\u2019t.\u201d\nJames\u2019 cheeks heated up, and he dragged a hand through his hair. \u201cWell. Alright, so you obviously know that this is all\u2026\u201d\n\u201cA prank?\u201d she offered. \u201cWhich makes no sense, of course. Why you\u2019d want to torment Sirius like that is beyond me.\u201d\nJames felt tired, suddenly, weighed down, and he sagged against the wall. After a moment of hesitation, Lily did the same, and nudged him with her knee. Ruffling his hair, James leant his head back and said, \u201cHis parents cut him off. Even after he went back, they cut him off. And with Remus being\u2026sick,\u201d he said.\nLily rolled her eyes. \u201cI won\u2019t make you say it, but you do know I\u2019ve known for about three years, right?\u201d\nJames wanted to be surprised, but it was Lily so\u2026 \u201cWell anyway, getting a job for him is going to be dreadful. And Sirius won\u2019t take anything from my parents so I figured, if I could get some money, then lose it to him in a bet\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSo you are going to lose the bet?\u201d she asked.\nJames sighed. \u201cYeah. I haven\u2019t told Regs yet, but yeah. And then Sirius will have a sack of galleons for him and Remus to\u2026you know. Get started.\u201d\n\u201cYou were counting on him to want whatever it was you had in your trunk,\u201d Lily said. Then she laughed. \u201cClever you, Potter. How long had you been working on that one?\u201d\nJames shrugged. \u201cSince fifth year. When I was doing tutoring sessions for a sickle each? I\u2019d let Sirius see me fuss with the sack, but I asked him to leave it when he\u2019d try and snoop. He tried to break in a few times, but he couldn\u2019t get past my spells.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the dating thing?\u201d she asked.\nJames shrugged. \u201cWell that just ended up being convenient. I never expected Regulus would ask me that. But I had to take the chance.\u201d\n\u201cEven if it meant torturing yourself with this crush.\u201d\nRolling his eyes at her, he sighed. \u201cWell it\u2019s not as if I realised it at first. I thought it would be something fun to play at. But turns out\u2026you were right. He\u2019s rather\u2026my type.\u201d\nShe sighed, giving him a pat on the arm. \u201cI know you better than you know yourself, you stupid sod. But for what it\u2019s worth, I think he fancies you back. The two of you just need to talk it out.\u201d\nJames laughed, the sound a little hollow and a little bitter. \u201cHe\u2019s\u2026well I\u2019m not sure he does. Or that he\u2019d go for it, in the end. I know I can be a bit overwhelming, and I\u2019m not sure he wants to put up with that.\u201d\n\u201cJames,\u201d Lily said quietly, then pushed to her feet and offered him her hand. When he took it, she straightened the front of his robes and met his gaze firmly. \u201cYour love is a lot. Bloody hell, just your crushes are a lot. But when it\u2019s the right person, it won\u2019t be. It\u2019ll be just enough. Maybe you should actually talk to him, hmm? Tell him how you feel?\u201d\n\u201cSeems like that would be a bit too logical, Lils,\u201d James said, but he was smiling, and at the very least, feeling a little better.\n*** \nHe didn\u2019t speak with Regulus. Not straight away. \nThe moon ended up being rough on Moony, and consequently rough on James, Sirius, and Peter who walked away a little worse for the wear having spent the night trying to keep Moony from tearing himself up, and tearing into Hogsmeade.\nJames found himself with a slight limp, and heavy bags under his eyes the next afternoon. It was Saturday, which meant his morning patrol was taken by Lily, and he did a cursory afternoon round of the grounds.\nAs he passed by the willows, his legs decided it was as good a time as any to give way, and he collapsed against the trunk of a shady tree. Wrapping his robes close round him, he let the soft ground soothe the ache in his bones, and his eyes shut.\nHe wasn\u2019t sure how much time had passed, but he startled when a warm hand touched his cheek, and his eyes flew open. \u201cWazzit? Wasn\u2019t sleeping\u2026just\u2026resting\u2026\u201d His words died off when he found himself staring into grey eyes. \u201cErm. Regulus?\u201d\nRegulus\u2019 lips were twisted into a smirk. \u201cYou look like shit, you know.\u201d\n\u201cCheers,\u201d James deadpanned.\nRegulus huffed a laugh, then to James\u2019 great surprise, settled back in the grass and pushed his head against James\u2019 shoulder. \u201cPeople were telling me I ought to take better care of my boyfriend. Said you were walking with a limp and looked like you hadn\u2019t slept in days.\u201d\nJames sighed, scrubbing his eyes with the heels of his palms. \u201cRough night.\u201d\n\u201cPranks?\u201d Regulus asked. \u201cWhat fresh hell can we expect to be unleashed today?\u201d\n\u201cNot a prank. Just\u2026Remus had a rough night. He\u2019s in hospital now, but we were\u2026dealing with it for hours. And I\u2019m just a bit knackered.\u201d\nRegulus hummed, then rolled onto his side and tucked closer to James. \u201cSo have a kip here then? Is that what we\u2019re doing?\u201d\nJames opened his mouth to argue, but frankly the body next to him felt too nice, too warm and soothing. So he did the next best thing to arguing\u2014he pulled Regs as close as he could, nuzzled his nose into his hair, and closed his eyes.\nHe\u2019d have to tell him sometime. How he\u2019d always planned to lose the bet\u2014and why. And how it was tearing him up inside because he wanted nothing more than to actually call Regulus his boyfriend. To take Regulus\u2019 face between his hands and kiss him soft and slow, and pour every ounce of love into the gesture. To maybe give Regulus a little peace, moments of safety where the darkness of his family couldn\u2019t touch him.\nHe wondered if Lily was right\u2014if maybe he wasn\u2019t always overwhelming. Not if it was the right person.\nSo yeah. He\u2019d have to bring it up eventually.\nBut right now, with Regulus warm and comfortable in his arms, James chose that moment to be selfish. To lose himself in the pretend. To forget that this was nothing more than a prank.\nJames was certain he\u2019d be able to drag it out until the end of the quarter, maybe even the end of the year if Regulus would be game, if things would stay uncomplicated. Only things were never uncomplicated.\nWalking into the dorm room after Quidditch, James didn\u2019t expect to find Sirius sat at the foot of Moony\u2019s bed, the curtains drawn shut, a spell humming quietly round them. There was a tension in the room that wasn\u2019t there when he\u2019d left, and Peter was mysteriously missing.\nWith a small sigh, James lowered himself, crossing his legs and pushing close so his knees brushed against Sirius\u2019. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\nSirius didn\u2019t answer, but thrust a crumpled bit of parchment at James which smelt of owl post. He unfolded it, and though his eyes read over the writing, he was having trouble comprehending it. \u201cWhat\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThe Anti-Werewolf legislation passed, by a landslide,\u201d Sirius said, his voice hoarse, devoid of emotion. \u201cRegistration has become mandatory, and registered wolves are prohibited from holding any jobs in public service, public office, transport, or anything relating to the Ministry. They\u2019re to transform at pre-determined locations, and will not be covered under the Ministry health care.\u201d\nJames\u2019 hand were shaking before he realised it, curling into parchment, making it bow under his rage and sweat. \u201cWhat\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI thought,\u201d Sirius said, and his voice broke, making him stop to clear his throat. \u201cMoony said he\u2019d be fine. Said he\u2019d be fine, then he spelled himself behind his curtains and hasn\u2019t come out since. His status is still unknown, but it probably won\u2019t be long before someone figures it out. I mean, we\u2019re not that clever.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re clever enough,\u201d James said fiercely.\nSirius looked up, his dark eyes furious and terrified. \u201cIt\u2019ll be on me, you know. Because he won\u2019t be able to work. It\u2019ll take a month, maybe two, before anyone connects Moony\u2019s absences with the moon. So it\u2019ll be on me to do well, and I could have\u2026I could have made it work, but I was such a stupid fucking prat, and had to go and piss off my parents and now I have nothing and what\u2026what am I going to\u2026what do I do?\u201d Sirius\u2019 eyes were wide, full of tears, wild as his voice broke and a few tears slipped down his cheeks. \u201cProngs,\u201d he whispered.\nJames gathered him close, holding Sirius to his chest, kissing the top of his head. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine. You\u2019ve got us, you know. Me, Peter, Lils and Marls. Regulus, even\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Sirius bit. \u201cBecause you don\u2019t know him. He\u2019ll run off and tell my parents just to get back into their good graces and\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI know you don\u2019t believe me, but he won\u2019t. He\u2019s not\u2026he\u2019s not like that, Pads. He hasn\u2019t been for so long.\u201d James squeezed his eyes shut and let his fingers brush through Sirius\u2019 hair. \u201cI won\u2019t tell him, but he won\u2019t rat you out. And\u2026Si\u2026you\u2019ve got me. You\u2019ve got mum and dad and they\u2019ll do anything they can. Everything,\u201d James said.\nSirius pulled his head away. \u201cI can\u2019t ask them to take us on like that. I won\u2019t. I\u2019m not afraid to hold up the money side of things. I just need to get started, you know, and I\u2019ll\u2026figure it out. I can sell my broom, sell whatever I have left from my bedroom and it\u2019ll be enough.\u201d\nJames said nothing, in spite of knowing his solution was sat under a bed, waiting for Sirius to take it. And he\u2019d have to, in the end. Because he\u2019d win it, and it was enough to set them up for a little while, and he\u2019d feel less bad when he realised none of it had been charity. James had earnt it all, and half of it was from Regulus.\nIt wasn\u2019t going to make them millionaires, but it was enough that they\u2019d be alright for meals and rent, and whatever else. Until Sirius could get started. And James wouldn\u2019t rob Sirius of his pride. And he wouldn\u2019t do it to Remus, either.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d James vowed.\n\u201cJust don\u2019t leave us, alright?\u201d Sirius said, his voice quiet. \u201cWhatever the bloody hell you\u2019ve got with Regs, just\u2026don\u2019t leave us.\u201d\n\u201cNever,\u201d James swore. And he realised then it was time to call it an end.\n*** \n Map in hand, James managed to sneak out after doing rounds, and it wasn\u2019t long until he was waiting near the lake, under the cover of his cloak as Regulus was on his way. James had sent a note through the fire, and had watched Regulus on the map as he got it, likely made excuses, then slipped away.\nHis heart was beating in his chest, anxiety thrumming through his veins because he didn\u2019t want to do this. He didn\u2019t want it to end now, to lose the excuse he had to touch Regulus, to pretend like all of this was more than it was. But Remus and Sirius were too important to him, and ending this meant that they would be less afraid, and less lost as the year raced toward its end.\nJames pulled the cloak off when he saw Regulus was outside, and he leant against the tree as he watched the dark form hurrying along the bank of the lake until he spotted James. Regulus\u2019 cheeks were slightly pink, the darker colour visible under the light of the moon just past full, and James ached to reach out and press the tips of his fingers to the heat there.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so important it couldn\u2019t wait until breakfast?\u201d Regulus demanded, his voice slightly hoarse, and just out of breath.\nJames bit his lip, then shrugged helpessly. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026time. To end this.\u201d\nRegulus blinked at him. \u201cWhat? Why? Potter\u2026if you\u2019ve gone and done something stupid\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI,\u201d James said, and faltered. He couldn\u2019t tell Regulus why, or what he was up to, but he needed him to be willing.\n\u201cSirius doesn\u2019t believe us yet, and if you think I\u2019m letting him get away with being such a prat\u2026\u201d\n\u201cLily wants to rekindle things,\u201d James blurted, hating himself for that being the first thing he thought of, but he didn\u2019t think it would really matter in the end. Regulus didn\u2019t actually fancy him, but he was fond of Lily so if he thought it was for Lily, he might be willing. \u201cShe told me\u2026she\u2019s unsure about Marlene and well\u2026I still love her so\u2026\u201d The lie fell from his lips like he was speaking through treacle, but he got the words out in spite of himself.\nHe watched as Regulus took a step back, something crossing his face that James couldn\u2019t read. Hurt, his mind supplied, but then he laughed at himself, because that would make no sense. \u201cI see,\u201d Regulus finally replied.\nJames swallowed thickly. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026want to lie to her, or lead her on. So\u2026I mean I know it\u2019s not great to lose the bet but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhy not just stage a split, then?\u201d Regulus asked, crossing his arms. \u201cWhy let my brother have the victory?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I\u2026\u201d James floundered for a good reason without giving it away. He came up blank, and felt his heart sink. \u201cRegulus\u2026if I told you it was important, and that I needed you to trust me\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve never given me reason to,\u201d Regulus spat, now sounding angry. \u201cWhy should I do this now?\u201d\nJames stepped back, feeling like he\u2019d been slapped. \u201cHaven\u2019t I? I\u2019ve kept your secret, not told anyone about it, have gone this far. I can\u2019t tell you why, but I can tell you it\u2019s a very good reason and I need\u2026\u201d James\u2019 voice fell into begging, unable to hide his emotions, \u201cI just need Sirius to know it was a prank.\u201d\nRegulus stared at him a long time, his stormy eyes narrow and angry, but James could see he was relenting. He could see it in the way the tension in his jaw eased, and something else, a raw, unreadable emotion, flickering across his face. \u201cYou owe me. If we do this, you owe me.\u201d\nJames nodded, breathing out in a rush. \u201cAnything, I swear. Whatever you want.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t\u2026there\u2019s nothing I want from you,\u201d he said, sounding even angrier somehow. \u201cNot now, but if I do\u2026in the future\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI will always be there for you,\u201d James vowed, meaning every word. \u201cI don\u2019t care what it is, I swear. I\u2019ll\u2026anything you need. Any time.\u201d\nRegulus gave a stiff nod. \u201cAlright. Then how do we do it?\u201d\nJames worried his bottom lip, then said, \u201cI think I have a way. There\u2019s just a few things we need to do, and we need to get to the owlry.\u201d\nRegulus sighed, rubbing a hand down his face. When he looked back up at James, there was defeat in his eyes, and sadness, but also resolution. \u201cFine. Let\u2019s get going. I\u2019d like to put this whole mess behind me, and forget we ever met.\u201d\n*** \nJames didn\u2019t know why he felt the ache of heartbreak as he curled into himself on a sofa in the common room. His eyes were roving over his texts, but he wasn\u2019t paying much attention to the words. He was waiting on edge, for Sirius to find the evidence, to come down here and confront him, level the accusation, and wait for James to confess.\nIt had all been a prank.\nAnd it was true, it was. However James had set it up, the whole thing had been a farce. So why did it feel like he was losing something?\n\u201cPotter.\u201d\nJames\u2019 head turned to the side, and he saw Lily walking into the room, her hair twisted into a plait, hanging over her shoulder. She sat primly, her bare feet crossed at the ankles, one arm slung along the back of the sofa.\n\u201cEvans. Bored, are we?\u201d\nShe rolled her eyes. \u201cCare to tell me why your boyfriend was glaring daggers at me this morning? I had to check all my food for hexes.\u201d\nJames\u2019 eyebrows shot up. \u201cI think it\u2019s\u2026for show. We erm. We split up.\u201d\n\u201cSplit up like\u2026\u201d\n\u201cLike this whole mess is over, and Sirius is going to work it out in about twenty minutes, I rec, and\u2026and it\u2019s done.\u201d\n\u201cAnd he was glaring at me because\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBecause\u2026because I told him we had to end it.\u201d Her look was unimpressed, so he sighed and said, \u201cI might have told him it was because you were considering working things out with me, and I was still in love with you.\u201d\nShe burst out with a giggle, covering it with the back of her hand. \u201cWhy the bloody hell would you say a thing like that? I don\u2019t want you\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThanks,\u201d James said dryly.\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ll eat Merlin\u2019s thousand year old pants if you still love me,\u201d she added.\n\u201cAnd disgusting,\u201d James finished. When it was clear Lily had no intention of giving up until he gave her an answer, he decided honest was his best option, and would probably feel the nicest since he\u2019d been sort of living about a hundred lies over the past few weeks. \u201cI needed Sirius to win the bet, and Regulus wouldn\u2019t give the game up if I didn\u2019t have a good reason.\u201d\n\u201cAnd telling him why Sirius needed to win the bet wasn\u2019t good reason?\u201d she pushed.\nJames scrubbed a hand down his face. \u201cMight have been, but it also might have meant Regulus would have tried to get involved and Sirius would have never forgiven me. And right now, with everything else\u2026\u201d\n\u201cMerlin, James, what have you got yourself into?\u201d Lily demanded.\nJames threw his hands up. \u201cIt isn\u2019t me, Lils. If Remus and Sirius weren\u2019t such bloody, fucking full of pride, this wouldn\u2019t even be an issue!\u201d\nHer face fell. \u201cIt\u2019s that registry thing the Ministry just passed, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nJames swallowed against a lump in his throat. \u201cSomething like that, yeah. I\u2019m just trying to help. I want\u2026I want to help get them started but you know how they are. So this was the only way.\u201d\nShe reached across the distance between them and squeezed his thigh. \u201cYou\u2019re a good friend, James. A really good friend. They\u2019ll get their heads out of their arses and let you help eventually.\u201d\nHe rolled his eyes. \u201cNot bloody likely, but I can hope. Either way, it\u2019s done. Regulus agreed to\u2026everything and it\u2019s\u2026done.\u201d\n\u201cSo why do you look like someone killed your pet Kneazle?\u201d\nJames shrugged. \u201cDunno. Just feels a bit shit, is all.\u201d\n\u201cBecause you fancy him.\u201d He spluttered as she stood, straightening her robes, and she gave him a firm pat on the cheek. \u201cTelling him will solve all that nonsense, you know. Swap rounds with me tonight. Because it seems like those two idiots aren\u2019t the only ones who need to get their heads out of their arses.\u201d\nJames might have argued, but just then Sirius came tromping down the stairs, crowing victory.\n*** \n\u201cI knew it. I bloody knew it.\u201d\nPeter sighed into his stew, spinning chunks of potato round with his spoon. \u201cYes. You\u2019ve only said about five hundred times since you found the letters.\u201d\n\u201cAnd how stupid were they to just leave them lying about where I could find them,\u201d Sirius declared.\nRemus\u2019 eyes narrowed on James, and James ducked his head because they all knew the truth. James wasn\u2019t stupid enough to just leave evidence lying about where Sirius could find it. But at the moment, Sirius needed a victory so badly, he needed the win, and he was going to soak in it for ages.\n\u201cYes well, that\u2019s me. Giant idiot,\u201d James said. He tried not to look behind him, across the hall at the Slytherin table where he knew Regulus was sat, probably not looking at him at all. \u201cI\u2019m full, and I\u2019ve got rounds in a bit. See you gents later.\u201d\n\u201cWith my prize!\u201d Sirius shouted after him.\nJames gave a mock salute. \u201cWith your prize.\u201d\n\u201cSounds ominous,\u201d Remus muttered, which was the last thing James heard before hurrying out of earshot.\nJames hadn\u2019t entirely decided\u2014at least not out loud\u2014that he was going to swap with Lily, but as he rounded the corner to Gryffindor Tower, he realised it wasn\u2019t even a decision he had to make. Yes, he had to end the bet so he could get this over with and give Sirius and Remus the damn money, but he was also feeling emptiness in his gut, worse than when he thought Lily hated him. And he\u2019d never been the sort to not do something about it.\nSo why hesitate because it was Regulus?\nHe checked his watch and saw he\u2019d have to meet Regulus just after dinner, which would give him the exact amount of time he\u2019d need to get everything set up for Sirius, and deal with any potential fall-out, as he was sure Sirius wasn\u2019t going to love what was in the bag.\nBut\u2026\nHe\u2019d take it. Because he\u2019d won it fair and square.\nJames was sat on his bed, the bag in his lap when Sirius came bursting through the door. He was alone, which was a relief for James, and he stood there with his hands on his hips.\n\u201cLet\u2019s see it, then. Whatever thing you thought you could be crafty in hiding from me.\u201d\nJames hesitated, then handed it out. Sirius seemed perplexed by the weight, and slightly hesitant to put his hand in the bag seeing as it was James, and there was no telling what might be in it, or spelled on it. But he turned to his bed, and dumped out the contents.\nThe coins made a rushing sound, the bag having been charmed, so there was more than expected. James watched as Sirius\u2019 eyes widened, his jaw tensed, his hands curling into fists. \u201cYou\u2026did this on purpose,\u201d Sirius said. \u201cWhere did this come from?\u201d\nJames swallowed thickly. \u201cWhen you ah\u2026when you left,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew your parents wouldn\u2019t be giving you anything, that it was done. For you. So I started tutoring and doing\u2026odd jobs here and there. Winning bets. None of it\u2019s from my parents,\u201d he said.\nSirius turned, his face unreadable. \u201cAnd you think I\u2019ll just take it?\u201d\n\u201cYou won it,\u201d James pointed out.\n\u201cYou tricked me!\u201d Sirius howled, throwing the now-empty bag at James\u2019 face. \u201cI\u2019m not some\u2026you can\u2019t just\u2026\u201d\nJames was on his feet, gathering Sirius to his chest. \u201cShut up, Padfoot,\u201d he growled, and for the first time, Sirius listened to him. His jaw snapped shut, and he sagged in James\u2019 embrace. \u201cI love you, and we both know you\u2019re a bit of an idiot. But you won the fucking bet, you were right, it was all rubbish and\u2026you\u2019re going to take the money and get you and Moons a decent fucking flat, and start work and be\u2026and be fine. Do you hear me?\u201d\nSirius sniffed once, twice, then nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re a bigger idiot than I am, Prongs.\u201d\nJames pulled back, lifting a brow. \u201cOh yeah?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Sirius said. \u201cHe was staring at you all through dinner, like I\u2019ve never seen him. Whatever you\u2019ve had with him\u2026it wasn\u2019t fake. Not on his end.\u201d\nJames let out a small laugh. \u201cYeah well\u2026wasn\u2019t on mine, either. But\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBut nothing. Go fix it, you stupid prat. If you really want me to take this money\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll take it regardless, Pads,\u201d James insisted, shoving Sirius away from him. \u201cMarauder bylaws. Can\u2019t be broken, not even by you.\u201d\n\u201cI hate you a lot,\u201d Sirius said.\nJames laughed, then leant forward and pressed a kiss to the centre of Sirius\u2019 forehead. \u201cYeah, but you love me a lot too. I\u2019ll\u2026see you later.\u201d\n\u201cGood luck,\u201d Sirius called, and maybe said a few other things, but James had stopped listening. He was running, gasping for breath, hurrying to right the one, massive wrong he\u2019d done during this whole thing. Because whether or not Regulus accepted him, he wouldn\u2019t be leaving these halls without Regulus knowing exactly how he felt.\n*** \nRegulus was always quite good at hiding his feelings, but tonight felt like torture. Rounds with Evans, which meant he\u2019d be staring at her, trying to play nice, knowing that she got the boy. She had won, in a game he hadn\u2019t even meant to play, and no one would expect him to be hurt. He wasn\u2019t supposed to have caught feelings.\nAll of this was\u2026so wrong.\nAs he approached the corridor where she\u2019d be waiting, Regulus panicked, turned, and fled. His feet tapped along the stone, taking him out the doors and to the paddock where he couldn\u2019t be found. He\u2019d be in trouble, possibly lose his badge for it, but what did he care. It wasn\u2019t something he\u2019d wanted, and regardless of his accomplishments, his parents would never see him as being good enough.\nHe collapsed round the back of the stables, his back pressed to the wood, his forehead against his knees as he curled into himself. Taking a breath, he felt it come out in a shaking gasp, and he hated himself for it. Why? Why did he have to be like this, why couldn\u2019t he just\u2026be like his brother, carefree and brave and\u2026\n\u201cRegulus.\u201d\nHis head snapped up, and for a moment he thought maybe he wanted so much, he dreamt it. Maybe his mind\u2014which was clearly working against him\u2014had conjured the image of James Potter with his stupid smirk and his stupid cloak, and his terrible hair, and his bright eyes behind those dumb glasses.\nExcept James was there. He was kneeling next to Regulus, and Regulus could feel the heat coming off him as he sat close, not quite touching, but nearly.\n\u201cWhy are you out here. We had rounds.\u201d\nRegulus blinked at him, his tongue feeling too thick for his mouth as he tried to force words out. \u201cI had\u2026\u201d he cleared his throat. \u201cI had rounds with Evans.\u201d\n\u201cShe swapped me,\u201d James said simply.\nRegulus blinked again, doe-eyed and owlish. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cBecause she told me I needed a chance to tell you what a fucking idiot I was.\u201d\nRegulus couldn\u2019t help the laugh that burst out of him, punched like a blow to the gut, and too loud in the quiet evening. \u201cYou didn\u2019t need rounds with me for me to know that, Potter. I\u2019ve known that since first year.\u201d\nJames\u2019 smile was soft, fond even, and was making Regulus reconsider everything he\u2019d ever known. Making him reconsider feeling the longing, and pining, and pain so he could take James up on the offer to stay with him, even if it would feel like walking on broken glass every morning to be with a man he couldn\u2019t have.\n\u201cWell, of course you knew,\u201d James said. \u201cI mean, you are the cleverest one of us all.\u201d He reached out then, his fingers long, a little crooked at the top knuckles, but they were soft and sweet as they brushed back a lock of Regulus\u2019 fringe. He didn\u2019t pull back. Instead he let his hand linger, curling into a fist, brushing the backs of his knuckles down Regulus\u2019 cheek, over the cut of his jaw, stealing any chance of breath he had.\n\u201cPotter,\u201d he managed.\nJames shook his head. \u201cI should have said before, but I needed\u2026it was important I do things the way I did them. It was for Sirius and Remus, and I love them more than anything.\u201d\nRegulus\u2019 laugh was bitter and wet, and he shook his head, pulling back away from James\u2019 touch. \u201cYeah, I knew that already.\u201d\nJames shifted closer, and Regulus bit back the urge to hex him. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. I\u2026I should have said, because you would have probably understood and I was a bloody fool for not just trusting you. Because I know you care about your brother\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOf course I do,\u201d Regulus snapped.\n\u201cBut I wasn\u2019t really\u2026thinking. Which of course everyone agrees is my biggest flaw, but I can only hope I\u2019ll make up for it with this. Assuming\u2026I\u2019m not wrong.\u201d\n\u201cAbout what?\u201d Regulus said, but his voice faded to a whisper as James\u2019 fist uncurled, and pressed warm and here against Regulus\u2019 cheek. It moved down, two fingers and a thumb pinching his chin, turning his face up. \u201cPotter,\u201d he breathed.\nJames\u2019 lips curled into a soft grin. \u201cIn case I\u2019m not being obvious\u2014which I\u2019m not sure is possible for me\u2014I\u2019m going to\u2026well I\u2019d like to, that is. Kiss you. If you\u2026\u201d\nRegulus had heard enough, had enough of James\u2019 blabbering and goings on. He was tired of Potter second guessing himself and taking his time because bloody hell if Regulus wasn\u2019t kissed right now he was going to die.\nSo he grabbed the front of James\u2019 robes with both hands, cutting off his words, and yanked him in. The kiss was too hard and messy, and James started laughing halfway through which made their teeth click together. And he tasted of anise which was bloody awful, but it was also the best kiss Regulus had ever had.\nWhen they finally broke away, he was kiss-dumb, staring with wide eyes as James cupped his face in both hands and pulled him in to leave a series of small, sweet pecks across his lips, down his cheeks, one lingering just under his ear.\n\u201cI\u2019ll take that as you fancy me back,\u201d James murmured against Regulus\u2019 burning-hot skin.\nThat was enough to bring him back, at least with enough wits to get the fingers of both hands buried in his hair, gripping hard. \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot, Potter.\u201d\nJames fought his grip as he pulled back a little, so he could look him in the eye with his stupid, beautiful smile. \u201cWell, we both knew that.\u201d\nRegulus huffed and tugged. \u201cWill you just shut up and kiss me again?\u201d\n\u201cWhat about rounds?\u201d James said.\nRegulus rolled his eyes. \u201cSod the rounds. You know Evans has us covered. Now kiss me or I\u2019m breaking up with you.\u201d\nJames threw his head back and laughed, then dragged Regulus into his lap and did just that. \u201cYour brother\u2019s not going to like this,\u201d he said once they\u2019d parted to catch their breaths. \u201cAnd I bet he won\u2019t believe us.\u201d\nRegulus smiled wickedly as he pushed his forehead against James\u2019. \u201cIsn\u2019t that more incentive to do it?\u201d\n\u201cEvil,\u201d James muttered.\n\u201cWhich is why you like me,\u201d Regulus countered.\nJames touched Regulus on the jaw again, then down to the front of his robes to hold him tight, possessive, which made Regulus feel like he was flying. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said, and kissed him once, twice, quick on the mouth. \u201cI suppose I do.\u201d"
