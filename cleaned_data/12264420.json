    "text": "\nThe Justice League knew one thing for certain about Batman: he didn\u2019t trust \n\nanyone\n\n. They said it as easily as they would say any other fact. The sky is blue, Flash needs to eat, and Batman doesn\u2019t trust.\n\n\nThey were comfortable with the fact that out of everyone on Earth, they were probably the closest there was to people that Batman \n\ntrusted\n\n.\n\n\n~~\n\n\nThey were in chains, watching as a bomb counted down.\n\n\n\n15\u2026\n\n\n\nSuperman tugged at his restraints, somehow unable to get out of them. A glance at the rest of the League showed them to be in the same position, despite their various enhancements and strengths.\n\n\n\n12\u2026\n\n\n\nThey wouldn\u2019t be able reach it in time. Even if they somehow \n\ndid \n\nmanage to get out of the chains, it would be too hard to disarm the bomb in the time that would be left.\n\n\n\n11\u2026\n\n\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t be able to make it,\u201d Flash realised with dread.\n\n\nThey watched in horror as it continued to count down, and finally Hawkgirl was the first to stop struggling. \u201cIf we must die, at least we will die with honour, amongst fellow warriors.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI would kinda prefer not dying at all,\u201d was the response as it continued to count down.\n\n\nAs soon as that was said, a large blue and black blur flipped into the room, running towards the bomb. The figure stopped for just long enough to send the League a thumbs up. At this point, however, it was more likely that they were enemies than allies. As soon as that was thought though, the bomb stopped ticking and instead there was a loud beep.\n\n\n\u201cHa! Got it,\u201d the man said. Then he turned back to look at the Justice League, a large smile on his face. His gaze fell on Batman and he crossed his arms, going as far as to raise an eyebrow.\n\n\nThe man had black hair, with a tight black body suit. The only colour on it was blue in the shape of a large bird, stretching over his chest, and blue streaks on his knuckles. His eyes were covered by a blue domino mask.\n\n\n\u201cHey, B, you do realize that \n\ncellphones exist\n\n, right? I\u2019ve literally just moved across the river. Call once in a while. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be this dramatic,\n\n\u201d he said as he waved at the bomb behind him, walking to help them out of their chains.\n\n\nBatman frowned, and the figure stopped untying them to put a hand on his hips. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while, huh?\u201d he said, and they looked around at each other trying to figure out who he\u2019d been talking to.\n\n\nBatman stared at him, and the figure crossed his arms. \u201cYou know, a thank you would be nice. It\u2019s not like I just saved your life or anything.\u201d\n\n\nBatman nodded his head at him, but didn\u2019t do anything else.\n\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon, you can do it. Words. Thank you, Nightwing.\u201d\n\n\nBatman sighed, and then in a longsuffering voice, \u201cThank you, Nightwing.\u201d\n\n\nThe rest of the League looked at each other in confusion. By this point they were speechless.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a few months, hasn\u2019t it? I wonder, when \n\nwas\n\n the last time we talked?\u201d\n\n\nHe looked at Batman, a challenging look on his face. When Batman didn\u2019t answer, he pulled out his phone.\n\n\n\u201cThree months. And that was for \n\nwork\n\n.\u201d He rolled his arm. \u201cWe should really catch up sometime, shouldn\u2019t we?\u201d\n\n\nWhen they were all standing on the ground, he stepped back and looked at Batman again.\n\n\n\u201cHow about we do brunch, Friday at 11. \n\nThat \n\nsafe house in Bludhaven. Bring your new friends!\u201d\n\n\nAnd then, without waiting for an answer from Batman, he backflipped out the window, and they could all just \n\nfeel \n\nBatman rolling his eyes.\n\n\nThey stood in silence for a second, staring at where he had been just before.\n\n\nThen, a barrage of questions. \u201cWho \n\nwas \n\nthat? Do you know him? \n\nHow \n\ndo you know him? Was he another Gotham vigilante?\u201d\n\n\nBatman ignored them all, instead choosing to turn away and try to get out his grappling hook.\n\n\n\u201cNo, no, you can\u2019t just drop something like that on us and then \n\nleave\n\n. Who was that?\u201d Barry crossed his arms. \u201cI, for one, am not finishing this mission until we know.\u201d\n\n\nHe was rewarded with a batglare, but Batman shook his head and answered anyway.\n\n\n\u201cThat was Nightwing,\u201d he said, in a tone that showed that he thought that it should have been pretty obvious.\n\n\nHe then turned back and, ignoring everyone else, got out his grappling hook again as he got ready to leave to continue the mission.\n\n\nBefore he could leave though, he heard Diana yell after him, \u201cWe\u2019re going to the brunch whether you like it or not!\u201d\n\n\n~~\n\n\n\u2018\n\nThat \n\nsafe house in Bludhaven\u2019 turned out to be a run-down apartment in what had to be the worst part of town, even just judging by what they could see.\n\n\nWhen Barry pointed this out, Nightwing just laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s Bludhaven. \n\nEvery\n\n part of town is the worst part of town,\u201d he\u2019d replied as if it was somehow normal.\n\n\nThey were all sat down around a table in costume, Batman and Nightwing sitting next to each other as the rest of the League eyed them suspiciously.\n\n\nThere was a lot of food on the table, which, seeing how Barry was eating, was probably a good thing. Before picking up any of the food, Batman had eyed Nightwing warily, who just laughed.\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I didn\u2019t actually cook anything. I stole it from Jay.\u201d That seemed to satisfy Batman, who had started to eat after that. The superheroes had then started to make small talk amongst themselves.\n\n\n\u201cSo, like. Who actually are you?\u201d Green Arrow finally asked, looking at Nightwing.\n\n\n\u201cI was waiting for that to come up,\u201d he said to himself. \u201cLike I said, Nightwing. I\u2019m Batman\u2019s first lovechild with justice!\u201d he said and started laughing. Batman just turned away, not saying anything in response.\n\n\nMartian Manhunter then spoke up. \u201cI was not aware that Batman had a child.\u201d He said it so calmly that no one was sure whether he was just joking, or if he had picked up a loud thought in the air. However, they all nodded and muttered their agreement.\n\n\nNightwing stared at them for a second, as if they\u2019d said something completely ridiculous, before he started laughing uncontrollably.\n\n\nAnd kept laughing, and he\u2019d fallen over in his chair. He made no effort to get up, and just kept laughing.\n\n\nBatman started moving closer to him and took out a small spray bottle, but Nightwing just shook his head and kicked him away. \u201cStop it, B,\u201d he said as he tried to wipe his eyes, \u201cI\u2019m not hit by Joker gas or whatever, this is just\u2026 \n\noh my god\n\n,\u201d he laughed again, \u201cThis is the funniest thing I\u2019ve heard in \n\nages\n\n. \u2018I wasn\u2019t aware that Batman had a child,\u2019 \n\noh my god\n\n, B without kids, \n\nhe wishes\n\n.\u201d\n\n\nBatman moved back and sat in his chair. \u201cWe get it; you can stop laughing now.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI \n\nreally \n\ncan\u2019t.\u201d He tried to wipe his eyes again, but was stuck on his mask. He shook his head and turned back to the Justice League, trying to usher them out the door.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s just,\u201d he chuckled to himself again, struggling to catch his breath as he turned to Batman. \u201cWe\u2019re so \n\nglad\n\n you\u2019re \n\nsocialising \n\nnow, Batman.\u201d\n\n\nWith that all eyes were on Batman again. Superman was the first to say what they were all thinking, as he raised his eyebrow.\n\n\n\u201c\u2026\n\nWe\n\n?\u201d\n\n\nBatman was gone before he\u2019d even finished the word.\n\n\n~~\n\n\nNo one sees Batman again until the next League meeting, not for lack of trying. The other human members had gone in their civilian identities to Gotham, trying to have a chance to question him, but each time they came back empty-handed.\n\n\nA few had gone back to Bludhaven to visit Nightwing and try to ask him about it, but he\u2019d just shook his head and laughed.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not ruining this, absolutely not. This is the best entertainment I\u2019ve had for ages,\u201d he said each time, before flipping back to whatever he was fighting.\n\n\nThey knew Batman was still at work, though. He\u2019d been in the news for defeating some villain or another in Gotham a couple times, and they all knew what that meant.\n\n\nHe was avoiding them.\n\n\nUsually, they\u2019d have thought nothing of it. It was Batman; he had all sorts of strange habits. Even Martian Manhunter, who could \n\nread minds,\n\n had given up on trying to figure him out. However, this time they were seeking him out for a reason. They \n\nhad \n\nto know.\n\n\nEven at the meeting, he doesn\u2019t say a word about Nightwing, or any other \u201cchild\u201d he might have. He\u2019s focused completely on the mission, and tries to ignore any questions they have.\n\n\nBut then the mission leads them to a place that makes them \n\nthink\n\n they\u2019ve figured it out, for a few seconds at least.\n\n\nIt was an unusual mission; someone was running around a heavily populated city, and was going around picking off a \n\nvery large \n\nnumber of politicians who were rumoured to be corrupt, as well as the occasional criminal. It wasn\u2019t something that the League usually went for, but it had been a slow week. That might have usually been good, but just because there were no villains running around didn\u2019t mean that they could slack off.\n\n\nIt took them a while to find the guy behind it, but when they finally got a look at him it seemed like it should have been a lot easier; he looked like he could be no older than twenty, with a red helmet, motorcycle jacket and a few guns \u2013 and for some reason he also had a red bat, similar to Batman\u2019s, on his chest.\n\n\nAnd somehow he\u2019d been doing it all \n\non his own\n\n.\n\n\nThe League showed up when he was about to take out the next guy, and he took one look at them and groaned.\n\n\nHe looked around at them until he found Batman, who was \u2013 \n\nsuspiciously\n\n \u2013 at the very back of the group. The teen glared at him (or so they assumed; it was hard to tell with the helmet) for a few seconds before groaning again.\n\n\n\u201cOh my \n\ngod\n\n. You\u2019ve got to be fucking \n\nkidding \n\nme, what the fuck. I thought I told you to keep out of my business, what is this,\u201d he gestured to the Justice League. \u201cSeriously, were you listening to a word I told you? Fuck, this is why I don\u2019t come home if I can help it.\u201d\n\n\nBatman put his head in his hands, which on its own was out of the ordinary. As the teen continued to rant, he shook his head, before growling out a simple, \u201c\n\nNo\n\n.\u201d\n\n\nThe teen stopped his rambling and instead put a hand on his hip.\n\n\nThe thought passed through the entire League\u2019s head at once. \n\nThey\u2019re related\n\n.\n\n\nIt made sense, in a way. That must be why he didn\u2019t talk about his kids; one was a murdering vigilante.\n\n\nFlash put an arm around Batman and tried to be consoling. \u201cHey, man, I think we get why you don\u2019t talk about your kids now. I mean, it must be weird knowing that you\u2019re \n\nyou\n\n and one of your kids went and became a weird, violent vigilante, right? I don\u2019t think any of us are gonna judge you for it or anything though, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\n\n\nBatman just shake his head, and Flash gets a slight idea that he \n\nmight \n\nhave said something wrong. That\u2019s just before the teen starts talking again.\n\n\n\u201cSeriously? \n\nOh my god\n\n, B, you can\u2019t be serious. You haven\u2019t even told them about us? Wow, oh my god. I\u2019m offended. We go through all the trouble of not killing each other on Father\u2019s Day or at family dinners, and this is the thanks we get? Oh my god. Wow. The other are going to be so offended, oh my god.\u201d\n\n\nBatman\u2019s head is still in his hands, and the League gets the slight idea that he\u2019s crying internally. What comes out of his mouth, however, is, \u201c\n\nThey are happy that I\u2019m socialising\n\n.\u201d\n\n\nRed Hood stops shouting and starts to laugh now, his large shoulders shaking. The League are ready to ask what he meant by \u201cthe others\u201d but he just shakes his head and starts to root around in his jacket pockets for his grappling hook.\n\n\nBefore he can fire it however, Batman seems to decide that nothing he can do can make it any worse, and calls after him.\n\n\n\u201cDoes this mean you\u2019re still coming to dinner tomorrow?\u201d\n\n\nRed Hood starts cackling again, and calls back, \u201cAbso-\n\nfucking\n\n-lutely, if only to tell them about this,\u201d before he fired his grappling hook and took off.\n\n\nThey watched after him, and Diana raised an eyebrow. \u201cCan \n\nwe \n\ncome to dinner tomorrow?\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\n\nAbsolutely not\n\n.\u201d\n\n\n They tried their luck with, \u201cWhat did he mean by \n\nothers\n\n?\u201d but when they turned to hear Batman\u2019s answer, he was already gone.\n\n\n\u201cFucking \n\nninja\n\n.\u201d\n\n\n~~\n\n\nThe next time it happened, they were on a mission in Gotham. This in itself was pretty amazing; Batman usually didn\u2019t let any metas or anyone enhanced inside \n\nhis \n\ncity, so they figured they wouldn\u2019t push their luck and try and ask any questions.\n\n\nIt was totally unexpected, but it happened when they were on the rooftops. They\u2019d started off in ne end of the city, and had to get to the other end to actually be where they needed to be, and Batman had \u2013 \n\nof course\n\n \u2013 said that he knew a quicker way to get there than through the streets.\n\n\nAnd, so, there they were, on the rooftops. They\u2019d stopped on one for a few seconds, when a girl wearing purple showed up out of nowhere and landed a solid punch on Hawkgirl, knocking her to her feet.\n\n\nThe Justice League were more than ready to start fighting back, ready for the worst \u2013 it was \n\nGotham\n\n, after all \u2013 before another teen wearing a red costume showed up in the shadows behind her and started yelling.\n\n\n\u201cNo, wait, Spoiler! \n\nThat\u2019s the Justice League\n\n, oh my god! You just punched \n\nHawkgirl\n\n!\u201d\n\n\nThe girl took a few steps back, yelling back, \u201cYeah, Red Robin, \n\nI kinda noticed that already\n\n!\u201d\n\n\nThen the two teens were both fully visible, and the League took a few seconds to look them over. They didn\u2019t seem to be hostile \u2013 at least, not anymore. They were both clearly quite young, as well as scrawny \u2013 they were really well outfitted though, and their costumes were obviously expensive.\n\n\nThe girl was wearing mainly purple, with blue boots, gloves and a blue mask. She had a purple hood over her hair, but some of it had fallen through \u2013 from what they could see, it was long and blonde. She was wearing a black belt and though at this point she seemed very nervous, she was obviously well trained.\n\n\nThe boy\u2019s costume was mainly a bright red colour, with black gloves and black patches on his pants. His hair was black, and he had a matching black domino mask covering his eyes. On the left side of his chest were two R\u2019s in a circle. He had a red cape that was the same colour as the red on his suit. He was wearing a black belt, that was clearly full. He too seemed nervous, but ready to fight if need be.\n\n\nBoth the teens looked nervous, flailing around. The boy extended his hand towards Hawkgirl, looking to pull her up but Shayera just shook her head, using one hand to push herself up while the other was clutching at her jaw.\n\n\nWonder Woman regarded the two vigilantes, a smile on her face.\n\n\n\u201cThat was a great hit,\u201d she said, looking over them both. \u201cAre you two new heroes? You seem quite young, but your skills are already very impressive.\u201d They both seemed very uncomfortable being under her gaze, so instead she smiled at them and turned to Barman, who she knew would be able to answer her question \u2013 after all, he knew everything that was going on in Gotham, right?\n\n\nHowever, when she looked at him, he had turned the other way, and Martian Manhunter was looking at him in that way he sometimes did, that meant that he was so mentally uncomfortable that he just couldn\u2019t ignore it.\n\n\nThe rest of the League turned to look with her, and gaped.\n\n\n\u201c\n\nNo way\n\n,\u201d Green Lantern was the first to speak up about it, \u201cPlease tell me that they\u2019re not\u2026\u201d\n\n\nRed Robin cleared his throat. \u201cUm, yeah. Hi dad, nice to see you\u2019ve made some friends?\u201d\n\n\nAnd that was when Spoiler lost it, laughing so hard that she doubled over. \u201cRed, can\u2019t you see how uncomfortable he is already? You can\u2019t make fun of your dad like that!\u201d She continued laughing, before she straightened again. \u201cHowever!\u201d she said, putting up a finger, \u201cHe is not \n\nmy \n\ndad, so guess who \n\ncan\n\n?\u201d\n\n\nBatman groaned, and even Red Robin was chuckling now.\n\n\n\u201cYou spend all your time at our place anyway, we all consider you family, so how come you can and I can\u2019t?\u201d he said as he laughed, and Spoiler just shoved him away, grabbing her grappling hook and firing it off.\n\n\n\u201cSorry, Hawkgirl! B, I\u2019m coming over for dinner tonight and telling everyone about this, because apparently I\u2019m family now!\u201d\n\n\nThe Justice League were, once again, left speechless. Batman just looked at them for a second, before continuing to run across the roof.\n\n\nSomehow that still wasn\u2019t the end of it though, as later that night, the League saw in front of them a figure wearing a costume that was almost completely black, except for an outline of a yellow bat and a yellow utility belt. She was wearing a cowl similar to Batman\u2019s, and a cape that was ripped at the ends.\n\n\nWhen she saw Batman she didn\u2019t say anything, but waved gleefully at him, and when he waved back she rushed forward and hugged him.\n\n\nShe then disappeared down the side of the building, only to be seen again when a drug dealer and his thugs were tied up at the corner of an alley.\n\n\nThey all stared for a few seconds \u2013 \n\nBatman hugging? \n\n\u2013 before Green Arrow turned to Batman.\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve \n\ngot \n\nto be the last ones, right?\u201d\n\n\nBatman fled before anything else could be said.\n\n\n~~\n\n\n\u201cThey were \n\nyoung\n\n. Mid-teens, at the most. There\u2019s no way there can be any others, right?\u201d\n\n\nEveryone else nodded in agreement. \u201cI just wanna know where they\u2019re all \n\ncoming\n\n from,\u201d Green Arrow muttered. \u201cTermites?\u201d\n\n\nGreen Lantern started nodding. \u201cRight out of the woodwork,\u201d he agreed.\n\n\nThey all agreed that it was strange though, that Batman was able to hide this many children and vigilantes from them.\n\n\n\u201cThe people of Gotham have to know about them, right? How come there\u2019s nothing about them in the news, like, ever, then?\u201d\n\n\nEveryone shrugs. \u201c\n\nGotham\n\n,\u201d is all Superman muttered in reply, as if it explained everything. From everyone\u2019s nods, it seemed like it did.\n\n\nFlash shook his head and smiled. \u201cI think it\u2019s \n\nadorable\n\n,\u201d he said and laughed. \u201cThere are so many of them. Imagine Father\u2019s Day in the Batcave! Do you think they all get him presents?\u201d\n\n\nThe others laughed, and Flash paled. \u201cJust\u2026 please don\u2019t tell him I said that.\u201d\n\n\n~~\n\n\nNone of them expected any other kids to appear, but by that point it had become something of a running joke, so they kept their eyes open just in case. They were waiting for it, even though they knew nothing would happen.\n\n\nThey were proven wrong when another mission brought them to Gotham. Batman was wary, as usual, of letting them in the city but he eventually agreed, if only because the mission was to retrieve a crate full of Kryptonite that was being transported through his city.\n\n\nBefore the mission they joked about running into more batkids, but nothing prepared them for when they actually did.\n\n\nThey met on the rooftops again, though this time, luckily, no one was punched. The first kid was wearing a costume with a yellow chest and black tights. He, like so many of the batkids, had a bat on his chest, the black contrasting with the yellow around it. He had a cowl similar to Batman\u2019s and Black Bat\u2019s, except his was yellow with black over the eyes.\n\n\nThe second was wearing an all-black bodysuit, and a grey utility belt. She had short black hair with the top dyed blue, and was wearing a blue domino mask.\n\n\nThey seemed to be patrolling, with the boy in yellow speaking into a comm in his cowl and the girl laughing at something. They seemed to be about to grapple off the building, when they caught sight of Batman and the League and stopped.\n\n\nUnlike the others, neither of them stopped to talk or hug Batman, and instead the boy waved awkwardly. Batman waved hesitantly back, and that seemed to be enough for him as he then shot his grappling hook and dived off the building.\n\n\nThe girl shrugged and then smiled and waved as well, and put both thumbs up when he waved back. She then got her grappling hook out and followed the boy.\n\n\nThey all looked at Batman. \u201cFirst: \n\nholy shit \n\nhow many do you have? Second: they both barely acknowledged you,\u201d Flash said with a laugh. Batman sighed.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Lark and Bluebird. He\u2019s new. She\u2019s \n\ntrying\n\n to be mad at me.\u201d\n\n\n~~\n\n\nAt the end of the mission, Superman grabbed a hold of Batman before he could leave. \u201cThey\n\n had \n\nto be the last ones.\u201d\n\n\nBatman just looked away and cleared his throat, and everyone gaped.\n\n\n\u201cHow many are there? Where are you \n\nfinding \n\nthese kids?\u201d\n\n\nBatman remained silent.\n\n\n~~\n\n\nFor the next one, they were at the Watchtower. Superman had been trying to use the computer, when all of a sudden it shut down, instead leading to a blank green screen.\n\n\nBatman sighed, and the rest of them looked at each other in confusion.\n\n\n\nWas someone trying to hack into the Watchtower?\n\n\n\nGreen Lantern voiced the thought, and they jumped when they received a response.\n\n\n\u201cSort of. Your security is \n\nterrible\n\n, I\u2019m fixing it. Why hasn\u2019t B done anything about it yet?\u201d a computerized female voice spoke.\n\n\nThey traded a look. \n\nAnother \n\nof Batman\u2019s kids.\n\n\n\u201cHe tried,\u201d Superman sighed, \u201cWe made him go to sleep.\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\u2026Alright, I can respect that.\u201d\n\n\nThen there was silence for a few minutes, until Flash spoke up.\n\n\n\u201cAre you another one of Batman\u2019s kids?\u201d\n\n\nThere was silence, before, \u201cNot really. I have a dad, B\u2019s more like\u2026 a weird uncle or cousin, who I see way too much of but mostly love anyway.\u201d\n\n\nThey all looked to Batman, who seemed torn between looking exasperated and flattered.\n\n\nThen they turned back to the screen.\n\n\n\u201cSeriously though, how many of you are there? Because we didn\u2019t think there were \n\nany\n\n, but there are so \n\nmany\n\n. Where is he finding you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMostly? We either show up and he accepts it, or he catches sight of a poor orphan who needs help and it tugs at something in him and he \n\nadopts\n\n.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHas that happened with many of you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAdopting? \u2026\n\nAt least\n\n five of us. And this is totally unrelated but, Batman, right now, Spoiler and Red Hood are at the manor and painting each other\u2019s nails. I\u2019ve saved all the pictures to your computer.\u201d\n\n\nThey looked at each other and Batman sighed, before saying quietly, \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\n\n~~\n\n\nThe next time they meet one of them, it\u2019s because she wanted them to.\n\n\nThey were on a mission, \n\nonce again\n\n, in Gotham. Batman was all but ready to just ban them all from his city so that things like these wouldn\u2019t happen in the first place.\n\n\nThey were in the middle of a fight when she appeared on a rooftop. She had long red hair and a black mask covering the top of her face, two large bat ears coming up out of the top. Her costume was mainly black, with red boots, red gloves, a red utility belt and a red cape. On her chest was a red bat. The lights shining behind her managed to accentuate all the colours that were in her costume, reflecting reds onto the wall.\n\n\nWithout a word she dove into the fight alongside Batman, keeping to his side and deflecting any attacks that came his way. The rest of them spared a glance to the two vigilantes, watching in amazement as this person they\u2019d never seen before kept up with and \n\nbeat\n\n Batman to the enemies.\n\n\n\u201cBatwoman, \n\nleave\n\n,\u201d Batman growled out, and it clicked in all their heads.\n\n\nAnother bat.\n\n\nShe continued fighting, managing to level a glare his way in the middle of it. \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d she said. Her voice was coated in annoyance. \u201cI\u2019ve seen your injuries, I\u2019m not letting you go home with \n\nmore\n\n.\u201d\n\n\nBatman just glared at her, and they got the sense she was rolling her eyes. Without looking his way she knocked out another thug.\n\n\nShe looked at Batman. \u201cDon\u2019t think I won\u2019t knock you out, because I will.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t doubt it,\u201d Batman growled, and he didn\u2019t retreat from the fight completely but he moved back to the edges of it, which still didn\u2019t seem to please Batwoman. She said nothing more about it though, instead taking his place in the fight.\n\n\nWhen it was down she walked back to him and put one hand on his elbow.\n\n\n\u201cNow, come back with me or I drag you. Either way, you\u2019re getting to the Cave.\u201d\n\n\nBatman levelled a stony glare at her. \u201cWe have mission reports.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAre they digital? Get one of them to do it.\u201d\n\n\nBatman sighed, before turning to the League. \u201cFlash, you\u2019re on mission report.\u201d\n\n\nThen he turned his back and started walking somewhere with Batwoman.\n\n\nEveryone stared at them walking away, speechless once again.\n\n\n\u201cSo, there\u2019s no way she\u2019s actually like, his kid, right?\u201d\n\n\n~~\n\n\nAfter all that, they were confident that there would be no more children or other ambiguous relatives showing up from Batman\u2019s life. After all, how many could there possibly be?\n\n\n\n(\u2026Catwoman didn\u2019t count.)\n\n\n\nThis meant that they were totally unprepared for what they would see when they finally entered the Batcave.\n\n\nBatman was getting ready to tell them his secret identity, and they all started looking around to give him time. If Batman had to gather the courage, it would have to be good, right?\n\n\nAround the cave there was what seemed like decades worth of costumes and tokens collected from various villains. A lot of them they identified as costumes belonging to the newer heroes and members of Batman\u2019s family that they had only just recently met.\n\n\nMost of their attention was caught, however, by the giant computer in the middle of the cave. It was gigantic, and someone was \n\nusing it\n\n.\n\n\nThey looked at each other and all seemed to silently laugh; the same thought had been in all their heads.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s another batkid\n\n.\n\n\nThey were all still surprised, however, when the chair squeaked and Batman\u2019s head popped up, as he let out a small growl.\n\n\nGreen Arrow gaped. \u201c\n\nNo\n\n.\u201d\n\n\nTheir chair spun around slowly to reveal another child, probably not even having reached his teens yet, sitting in the chair stroking a cat that was in his lap.\n\n\nHe was wearing a costume similar to many of the others on display, with a red top and black pants, with large green boots. He had an R on his chest, and was wearing a black and yellow cape, along with a green domino mask.\n\n\nIn short, he looked like a walking traffic light.\n\n\nThe cat was black with white spots, and he was petting it like he was a second-rate Disney villain.\n\n\nHe glared at the League, before looking at Batman. \u201cFather,\u201d he started and Batman groaned, \u201cwho are \n\nthese\n\n?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow many kids do you \n\nhave\n\n?\u201d Green Arrow yelled in disbelief, and everyone else just gaped.\n\n\nSuperman turned to Batman and put his hand on his shoulder. \u201cBatman, you\u2019re my friend and I admire you a lot, but\u2026 I think you have a problem.\u201d\n\n\nBatman sighs and turns to the kid, who is so tiny he would barely reach most of their chests.\n\n\n\u201cRobin, you were supposed to be in bed hours ago,\u201d he growled, \u201cGo to sleep.\u201d\n\n\nThe kid, \n\nRobin\n\n, shook his head, causing them to gape at him again. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\nBatman glared at him, and the kid just glared back. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving this spot. Alfred is \n\nasleep\n\n on me.\u201d\n\n\nBatman put his head in his hands. The kid smiled, satisfied that he\u2019d won, and turned back to the Justice League. His eyes raked over all of them, before stopping at Wonder Woman.\n\n\n\u201cWonder Woman. Father tells me you are a worthy fighter,\u201d he started.\n\n\n\u201c\n\nPlease\n\n don\u2019t,\u201d Batman said more to himself than Robin.\n\n\nRobin just smiled. \u201cI challenge you to a duel,\u201d he finished, before adding, \u201cAs soon as Alfred wakes up.\u201d\n\n\nBatman shook his head and sighed. \u201cHe did it.\u201d Chances were that he was crying under his cowl.\n\n\nThen the door to the cave opened, providing an opportunity for Batman to turn away from everything that was happening in front of him.\n\n\nAt the top of the stairs was what seemed like a butler. \u201cMaster Bruce,\u201d Batman ignored all their \n\nlooks\n\n, \u201cI believe now may be a bad time to mention it, but all the children are upstairs waiting for you to \n\nformally \n\nintroduce them.\u201d\n\n\nBatman sighed and glared at Robin, and none of them knew if it was because he hadn\u2019t done as he was told or if it was just because he was the only kid there that he \n\ncould \n\nglare at.\n\n\nDiana seemed to finally be able to talk again. \u201cIs he at least the last of your kids?\u201d\n\n\nBatman. \u201cMostly. Some come in and out.\u201d\n\n\nSilence for a second.\n\n\nThen, \u201c\n\nWhat the actual fuck\n\n?\u201d\n\n"
