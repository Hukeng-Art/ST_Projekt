    "text": "I. \nThere\u2019s a tickle in Izuku\u2019s throat as he eats breakfast that morning. \nHe doesn\u2019t think much of it, at least not at first. In the hustle and bustle of the past ten months jam-packed with training, he\u2019s developed a pretty severe case of tunnel vision, as can be seen by the multiple times that his mom has caught him staring blankly at, respectively, a dead fish, a completely blank wall, and his own shoe. Izuku dimly notes that the itching kind of reminds him of having to eat All Might\u2019s hair the previous night (ugh) and that it\u2019s. His thoughts quickly move onto the entrance exam that he\u2019s going to be attempting in just a few hours, and within a minute or two, he\u2019s completely forgotten about the entire thing.\nBut, as Izuku keeps on eating breakfast, the sensation gets worse. His throat feels tight and swollen, and he starts coughing and struggling to take full breaths. His stomach spasms abruptly, and he shoves himself back from the table, running to the bathroom. Is he having some sort of reaction because of the hair he ate yesterday? Is All Might wrong, and his body isn\u2019t ready yet? Is his body rejecting One for All, or worse (and Izuku suspects far more likely, because even his immune system doesn\u2019t have that kind of confidence), One for All somehow rejecting him?\nIzuku bends over the toilet and heaves. Chunks of partially-digested egg, mixed with bile and the orange juice he\u2019d been drinking with his breakfast, pour out of his mouth. Egg. There\u2019s something about that detail that\u2019s niggling at him, but he can\u2019t quite put his finger on what. \nThere\u2019s a gentle knock on the bathroom door. \u201cIzuku, are you alright?\u201d His mother asks. Izuku can hear the worry in her voice, and it\u2019s instinct to call back, \u201cyeah!\u201d in as reassuring a tone as he can manage, even as his stomach spasms and he falls into another round of vomiting. \n\u201cBaby, if you\u2019re sick, you shouldn\u2019t go to the entrance exam,\u201d comes his mother\u2019s concerned voice. \u201cI know that you\u2019re excited to try out for UA, but your health is more important.\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m not sick,\u201d Izuku tells her, clearing his throat in an attempt to get the acidic taste of stomach bile out of his mouth. He felt fine yesterday, and he woke up this morning feeling a bit stressed and anxious, but mostly just excited. It was only once he started eating that things had started to go wrong. \nIzuku\u2019s eyes widen as a realization hits him. Eggs. He had eggs for breakfast. He remembers that when All Might outlined the American Dream: Aim to Pass meal plan, he mentioned that he had suddenly become allergic to eggs at one point in his early adulthood. It makes sense that the same thing could happen to Izuku. Izuku wants to cheer. Not only is this an explanation that means he can still go to the entrance exam, but it\u2019s another way that he\u2019s like All Might!\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mom,\u201d Izuku calls, \u201cI\u2019m just having an allergic reaction to eggs!\u201d \n\u201cAn allergic reaction to eggs?\u201d comes his mother\u2019s skeptical reply. \u201cBaby, you\u2019ve been having eggs for breakfast your entire life.\u201d \n\u201cI know! But I wasn\u2019t allergic before now! Sometimes people gain allergies later in life. I know that it happened to All Might, so it makes sense that it could happen to me, too!\u201d \n\u201c...alright,\u201d His mother replies in a voice that clearly conveys the sentiment, that sounds wrong but I don\u2019t know enough about allergies to dispute it. \u201cIf you\u2019re sure that you\u2019re not sick, you\u2019d better go get ready. You\u2019re going to be late.\u201d \nIzuku grins and, quickly rinsing his mouth out with some water from the sink, bounds off to get dressed for school. He\u2019s so excited for the entrance exam!\n\u00a0\nII. \nIzuku wakes up the morning of his first day at UA with a cheerful tune bouncing around in his head. It\u2019s not a song that he can remember hearing before, but it\u2019s got such a catchy quality to it that he can understand why it\u2019s stuck in his head now. \nIt\u2019s not so bad, at first. Izuku times his footsteps to the jingle\u2019s beat as he walks to the train station, and he hums it to himself as he scrolls through his phone on the ride to UA. It\u2019s a good distraction from thoughts of what UA will be like\u2014 it\u2019s hard to get stuck in an anxious spiral when every three seconds or so, his thoughts are derailed by the song starting back up again.\nIzuku is so busy with half-formed, interrupted thoughts of the day ahead that he doesn\u2019t notice the reaction of a wizened old woman nearby. She lifts one hand that had been clinging to her stroller to carefully turn her hearing aids up, a look of deep concentration and vague bemusement on her face. \n\u201cIt is,\u201d she gasps softly, covering her mouth with one trembling hand. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard that song in years.\u201d When she was a child, her mother would hum that odd little ditty sometimes. How this young boy\u2014 barely a high school student judging by his uniform\u2014 knows it, she has no idea. \nCompletely unaware of the reaction he\u2019s garnered, Izuku steps off the train and heads into UA, still humming to himself. It\u2019s been long enough that the tune\u2019s starting to get a bit annoying, but it just won\u2019t leave his head. Hopefully once class starts, it\u2019ll stop bothering him. He\u2019s not sure if he\u2019s going to be able to pay proper attention in class if this keeps up. \nUnfortunately, the earworm lingers. As the girl from the entrance exam introduces herself, as the boy with the engine legs and a habit of making chopping motions with his hand orders them all to their seats, as their teacher (who is dressed in a bright yellow sleeping bag) crawls into the classroom, the tune continues playing on repeat in his head. \nThis isn\u2019t funny anymore, Izuku thinks despairingly. It\u2019s already entirely too clear that Aizawa-Sensei is going to be a hard teacher, and unlike everyone else here, Izuku only has a couple of weeks of experience with his quirk under his belt. How is he supposed to keep up with everyone else around him if he\u2019s being continually distracted by this irritating, obnoxiously infectious tune? \nIzuku can barely parse out Aizawa-Sensei\u2019s instructions since somehow, despite being inside his head and thus having no actual volume, the tune seems to have gotten louder. He quickly gets dressed in his P.E. uniform, desperately wishing that he could somehow stick earplugs far enough up his brain to make that annoying string of notes shut the fuck up. \nAs if to taunt him further, the song somehow gets even more obnoxious. Izuku grinds his teeth together. Is this the product of someone\u2019s quirk? Did someone on the train to school use their quirk on him out of some sort of petty sadism? Or is this some sort of karmic retribution for some sort of sin in his past life? What could Izuku have done to deserve this? He\u2019s always picked up his trash, eaten his vegetables, and taken proper care of his All Might toys. This isn\u2019t fair. \nWhen Aizawa-Sensei announces that the loser of the Quirk Apprehension Test will be expelled, Izuku feels his heart quite literally skip a beat. There\u2019s no way that he\u2019s going to be able to do as well as the others, not when he has so little experience and he is being driven absolutely batshit by this goddamn jingle.\nStill, Izuku tries his best through all of the tests. When he\u2019s doing the 400-yard sprint, he imagines he\u2019s sprinting away from the song stuck in his head. During the grip strength test, he imagines that the bar he\u2019s gripping is the song, and he squeezes almost twice as hard as he usually would due to the sheer motivational powerhouse that is imagining choking the life out of that hated jingle. And, when it\u2019s time for the sit-ups test, he imagines that each time he successfully completes a sit up, the song experiences the burning pain his abdomen along with him. \nUnfortunately, his attempts at keeping his sanity are ultimately fruitless, and he can tell that he\u2019s lagging behind the others despite his best efforts. After everything that All Might has done, all of the time and effort he\u2019s investing into training Izuku, there\u2019s no way that Izuku will let himself fail now. So, when it\u2019s time for the baseball throw, he winds up and prepares to use the full force of One for All, even if it breaks his arm again. \nThe ball flies a pathetic few feet forward and flops anticlimactically onto the dirt. Evidently, Aizawa-Sensei just erased One for All. But, more importantly, the song is gone! His mind is blissfully, wonderfully quiet! Izuku can\u2019t help but grin widely, tears of joy making his vision blurry. \u201cIt\u2019s gone!\u201d he chirrups. He wants to laugh from sheer delight.\nAizawa-Sensei stares at him, both of his caterpillar-like eyebrows having risen so far up that they appear to be hiding in the mess of dark hair that is currently floating in a halo above his head. Izuku could swear he can hear the man saying something about \u201calready knowing who this year\u2019s problem child is going to be.\u201d \nIzuku doesn\u2019t care. He\u2019s too busy glorying in the wonderful, blissful quiet. He doesn\u2019t even bother to wonder why, exactly, the song had disappeared at that exact minute\u2014 if asked, he would have probably said that it was because Aizawa-Sensei\u2019s glare was so formidable that even errant earworms could be struck dumb under its force. \n\u00a0\nIII.\nIzuku stares at the sheet of paper in front of him, feeling like he\u2019s facing down some sort of terrifying villain intent on smashing him into nothing more than a green, All Might-loving stain on the floor. \nUsually, he doesn\u2019t have any trouble in Snipe\u2019s class\u2014 he loves quirk history, and honestly, he already knew most of what Snipe\u2019s been teaching them since before he even went to middle school\u2014 but right now, there\u2019s a battle raging in his head. \nOn the one hand, he remembers reviewing the content for this chapter\u2019s history test with Uraraka and Iida, and he\u2019s almost certain that Iida\u2019s notes said that the Hero Commission were the ones to spearhead the Underground Hero Protection Bill.\nOn the other hand, even though he can\u2019t remember ever hearing anything to suggest this in class or in any of his study sessions with the other students, for some reason he feels sure at a bone-deep level that actually, the Hero Commission fought the bill tooth and nail until a public scandal involving the death of an underground hero forced them to allow the bill to pass. \nIzuku chews on the inside of his mouth, trying to figure out which answer to go with. He should probably go with the explanation Iida gave; Iida is a much more reliable source than \u201cI just thought otherwise for some reason\u201d. For all he knows, he could be getting this idea about the Hero Commission fighting the bill from some sort of conspiracy theory on a hero forum, or somewhere equally unreliable. \nIt\u2019s no conspiracy theory, an utterly certain voice within him informs him darkly. The Hero Commission just wants to take credit for the very same bill that they opposed. Hypocritical, slimy bastards. \n\u201cFive minutes!\u201d Snipe warns as he continues patrolling the aisles of the classroom.\nTaking a deep, steadying breath, Izuku cracks his knuckles and makes a decision. He starts writing as quickly as he can, his pencil smearing a bit beneath his hand as he scribbles out an abridged version of the events surrounding the bill\u2019s emergency. In a few sparse sentences, he covers the initial advocacy for it by underground heroes, Prism\u2019s subsequent very public death, and the abrupt about-face that the Hero Commission had made. \n\u201cAnd\u2026 put down your pencils! If you haven\u2019t already done so, please hand in your test!\u201d Most of the class finished a while ago, so it\u2019s just Izuku, Kaminari, and Ashido. Kaminari eyes him with slightly raised eyebrows; Izuku is meticulous enough in double and triple-checking his answers that he\u2019s by no means at the front of the pack in terms of test-taking speed, but he\u2019s never been one of the last to turn his paper in before.\nOne of the great things about Snipe-Sensei\u2019s class is that he\u2019s one hell of a speed grader. He takes Ashido\u2019s test and flips through it, his red pen flashing as the pages turn. Ashido winces at every strike of the red pen, but when Snipe hands the test back, she grins to see that she actually managed to pass. \n\u201cGood job, Ashido-san,\u201d Snipe says, holding out a hand for Kaminari\u2019s test. Kaminari\u2019s test is similarly quickly graded, and, as Ashido and Kaminari exit the classroom a few steps behind the rest of their lunch-bound classmates, Izuku hands in his own assignment. \nAt first, Snipe moves through it just as quickly as he had for everyone else\u2019s tests, but about halfway through, he slows and then stops completely. For a moment, Snipe is frozen; not frozen like Todoroki used his cold side on him, but frozen like time has somehow stopped. Izuku is just considering whether or not he should fetch Aizawa-Sensei to negate the effects of whatever errant quirk is clearly being used on Snipe-Sensei when Snipe slowly puts down the test and looks at Izuku gravely. \n\u201cMidoriya,\u201d he says, \u201cI don\u2019t know how you found this out, but this information,\u201d he taps on Izuku\u2019s answer about the Underground Hero Protection Bill, \u201cis something that the Hero Commission is extremely invested in keeping under wraps.\u201d \n\u201cWhat?\u201d Izuku squeaks. But\u2014 he\u2019d never done any extensive research into that bill! How could he have learned some huge secret the Hero Commission is keeping, by accident?\nSnipe sighs. \u201cI\u2019ll give you full marks for that question since that is the honest, historical fact, but please don\u2019t go around acknowledging what really happened. You\u2019re a good kid, and I don\u2019t want the Hero Commission to make life difficult for you. Alright?\u201d \nIzuku nods, still in shock. \nSnipe writes out a big 100 at the top of his test and then rips the sheet of paper with the question on the Underground Hero Protection Bill off. He pulls a paper shredder from under his desk and starts feeding Izuku\u2019s answer on the Underground Hero Protection Bill into it. \u201cIf anyone asks, say that I spilled coffee on that page, and that\u2019s why you don\u2019t have it,\u201d he tells Izuku calmly. \n\u201cY-yes, sir.\u201d Izuku\u2019s hand clenches around the test, making creases appear in his carefully-written answers. How, by All Might\u2019s left hair tuft, did he end up in this situation? He wasn\u2019t trying to find out super-secret information! He just wanted to get a good grade on his history test! \nWith a nod of satisfaction, Snipe waves him out the door. As soon as he\u2019s exited the classroom, Izuku lets out a slow breath of relief. At least Snipe-Sensei didn\u2019t seem to be angry at him. He\u2019ll just\u2026 have to be more careful about how he studies for history tests, he supposes. \n\u00a0\nIV. \nIzuku takes a deep breath, trying to prepare himself for the roaring of the crowds that he knows will be coming. After years of having eyes on him mean pain, it\u2019s difficult to endure having literally thousands of people watching his every move. \nIt\u2019s okay, though. Izuku managed during the obstacle course and the cavalry battle, and he\u2019ll manage now, too. Even if it\u2019ll be a thousand times worse, what with Izuku and his opponent being the sole center of attention. \nIt\u2019s time to head out now. Izuku forces himself to keep walking with his eyes straight ahead, even as he can hear Present Mic yelling out an introduction and the crowd letting out a wave of noise. The only people out here who matter are him and his opponent, Shinsou Hitoshi. \nIzuku is honestly pretty sympathetic towards Shinsou. Sure, what he had said about their class was kind of cruel when you consider that there\u2019s only so much attention on them because they got attacked by villains, but he doubts anyone who hasn\u2019t been in a villain attack really understands how traumatizing that kind of thing is. Plus, Izuku can relate to him\u2014 he would probably be him, or someone even worse off, if not for All Might giving him One for All. \nBut right now, Izuku can\u2019t let his sympathy stop him from giving the match his all. All Might wants him to say \u201cI am here!\u201d to the audience, and that means he can\u2019t give up. Izuku faces Shinsou, making sure to keep his lips firmly pressed together as he remembers the warning that Ojiro had given him. \n\u201cSTART!\u201d\nPractically before Present Mic is done speaking, Shinsou begins trying to rile him into replying, insulting everything from his fighting style to his hair. Years of bullying allows Izuku to resolutely ignore him without so much as a blink. It\u2019s only when Shinsou says something about how foolish Ojiro was to drop out that Izuku isn\u2019t able to contain himself. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong!\u201d he bursts out. \nHis body abruptly goes limp, and he can see Shinsou grinning. \u201cGot you,\u201d he says. Izuku tries to struggle, tries to make his body bow to his will once more, but it\u2019s like his mind is cut off from his body. \n\u201cWalk out of the ring,\u201d Shinsou commands grimly. Izuku can feel himself moving, turning to obey Shinsou\u2019s order. Through his blurry eyes, he can see the grass of the ring, the dark of the entrance, the brightness of the glowing lights within it\u2014 wait, what?\nThere\u2019s a collection of strange, glowing figures standing in the dark of the exit. As Izuku watches, the brightness of the lights seems to grow brighter and brighter, until Izuku is half-blinded by a rush of rainbow colors flowing past him in a show worthy of any psychedelic orgie back in the 20th century. \nThis is a terrible idea, Izuku thinks he hears a female voice say. This is just encouraging his bad habits.\nIf Izuku could, he would bristle. After the Quirk Apprehension Test, Aizawa-Sensei pulled him aside to talk about his quirk. Apparently, he was worried, based on Izuku\u2019s reaction to having his quirk erased, that Izuku had some sort of trauma surrounding the use of his quirk. \nAt first, Izuku was mortified by the fact that he was going to have to explain about the song stuck in his head. Instead, he ended up accidentally revealing that he\u2019d only had his quirk since the Entrance Exam. \nAizawa-Sensei went as pale as a sheet, and, to Izuku\u2019s deep shock, immediately apologized (him! a teacher!) for not giving Izuku the adequate support for his situation. Shortly after the conversation, Aizawa-Sensei arranged for Izuku to meet with a quirk counselor who was an expert in late, traumatic quirk manifestations. His counselor is honestly an angel, and Izuku\u2019s managed to avoid breaking any bones since. \nBarely, the female voice notes critically. Letting Nine break more bones now is like giving a recovering alcoholic a shot of vodka for the road. \nDo you have any other better ideas? a dry male voice asks in reply. As much as I hate to say it, I think breaking a few fingers is the better option here.\nThere\u2019s a noise that could be either a sigh or passing wind. The lights rushing past him seem to glow even brighter, and suddenly Izuku can feel the heat and power of One for All pooling in his fingers. His first two fingers explode, a shockwave of power rolling out around him. Across the ring, Shinsou is staring at him, his purple eyes wide. \u201cH...how?\u201d \nIzuku, having finally learned his lesson about not answer Shinsou, doesn\u2019t respond. He approaches steadily and then starts physically pushing Shinsou out of the ring. Shinsou tries his best to push him back, but instinct has Izuku easily judo flipping Shinsou over one shoulder. Shinsou slams to the ground, well outside the ring. \nIzuku reaches one hand down. \u201cYour quirk is so cool!\u201d he cheers through the blood that\u2019s started gushing from his nose. \u201cCan you command people to do more complicated tasks, like adding numbers, or is it just physical tasks and you still have to do the thinking? Do different people hallucinate different things, or is it always the same glow-y figures that I saw?\u201d \n\u201c...glow-y figures?\u201d Shinsou mutters, his face twisted in confusion. \n\u201cI couldn\u2019t tell you during the match because obviously then you\u2019d use your quirk on me, but I think you\u2019re really cool! It\u2019s not really Class 1-A\u2019s fault that we got attacked by villains, but I can see how frustrating it must be to have everyone ignoring the other courses. I bet your class is really proud of you for doing so well! I promise I\u2019ll keep on working hard in the tournament so it won\u2019t look like you lost to someone easy to defeat!\u201d \n\u201c...thanks,\u201d Shinsou says slowly, his face blank as he processes the fact that apparently, Midoriya \u201cGolden Child\u201d Izuku thinks that he\u2019s cool. He and Izuku are so lost in, respectively, the delight of quirk analysis and the delight of being aggressively befriended, that neither of them thinks about the actual origin of the mysterious glowing figures. \n\u00a0\nV. \nIzuku stretches, feeling his sore muscles protest at the movement. Fighting Gran Torino was fun, but he\u2019s glad that they\u2019re taking a break to pick up taiyaki. His stamina is a lot better than it was before training with All Might, but even with all of that training, Izuku still can\u2019t keep up with Gran Torino. \nNot that anyone can. Izuku chuckles fondly as he recalls a younger Gran Torino zipping across the city like a ping pong ball on caffeine. \n\u201cBy the way,\u201d Gran Torino asks, \u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to ask you. How come you didn\u2019t fall for my \u2018senile old man\u2019 act?\u201d \nIzuku smiles as he recalls entering Gran\u2019s apartment. Gran had pretended to mistake Izuku for All Might and had devolved into a serious of confused-sounding questions about who he was and what he was doing there, but Izuku had just laughed and said, \u201cit\u2019s good to see you, Gran Torino.\u201d \nIzuku shrugs and gets up onto his tiptoes so he can reach up to grab Gran Torino\u2019s favorite brand of taiyaki. \u201cHonestly? No idea.\u201d \n\u00a0\nVI.\nIzuku knows that the whole point of this mission is to get Kacchan and leaves soon as humanly possible. Logically, whoever this is (All for One, a voice within him whispers) is a hell of a lot more than Izuku can take on, and he should leave him to All Might and Gran Torino. \nKey word being logically. Because unfortunately, Izuku is feeling rather devoid of logic at the moment. \nIzuku bites into his fist, hard. He doesn\u2019t think that screaming that a powerful villain has an \u201cuglier face than a melted barbie with failed botox injections\u201d would be a very good idea, as tempting as it is. He\u2019s not even sure why he\u2019s so mad. \nWell, yes, the dollar store Darth Vader knock off did kidnap Kacchan and is currently fighting his dad mentor, but usually that wouldn\u2019t be enough to leave Izuku so utterly, senselessly, absurdly spitting mad. \nHe leveled Osaka just because he knew that my wife lived there, Izuku thinks, both a) nonsensically and b) very angrily. First of all, Izuku doesn\u2019t have a wife. Second of all, Osaka was destroyed in an earthquake about a hundred and forty years ago. Third of all, and most importantly, what the fuck?.\nHe killed my three-year daughter, Izuku thinks, rage and confusion rushing through him at the thought. Three-year-old daughter? He\u2019s fifteen! And that\u2019s not even getting into the fact that he thinks he would know if he had a daughter, much less a dead one! \nHe got my sidekick to betray me, Izuku mentally snarls. Which. He doesn\u2019t have a sidekick, unless you count Kacchan, which you shouldn\u2019t because if Kacchan ever heard you doing that he would fuck you up. Also if there\u2019s one thing to learn from this whole mess, it\u2019s that Kacchan would never become a villain, not even just until he gets rescued, even when he really should, the self-sacrificing idiot!\nDon\u2019t get mad at Kacchan, get mad at All for One, a voice advises wisely. Izuku\u2019s face curls at the thought of that sick bastard. (Next to him, Kirishima is eyeing him fearfully. Izuku is too busy calming himself down by picturing wringing All for One\u2019s greasy neck to notice.) If they keep on lingering here, he\u2019s going to run out of willpower and start cursing the cocknosed, cowardly son of a bitch out, common sense be damned. \n\u201cRight,\u201d Izuku says, grimly ignoring the odd cacophony of suggestions of favored swear words to aim at All for One clanging through his head, \u201cI have a plan to rescue Kacchan.\u201d \n\u00a0\nVII.\nIzuku should have realized that moving into dorms when his quirk is apparently fucking haunted wasn\u2019t a good idea. Not that All Might can definitively say that it really is haunted, since apparently he was lucky enough to never channel the rage (and trauma) of the previous One for All users, but considering what had happened at Kamino, it\u2019s the most favorable option of the bunch. \nThe other options being that Izuku has gone fucking insane, and\u2026 that he\u2019s gone fucking insane. Izuku can\u2019t really think of any other reasonable explanations, to be honest. Yay him. \nIzuku was sleeping soundly, enjoying a dream where was soaring through the sky with a quirk that allowed him to levitate, when he abruptly woke up to find Kaminari, Todoroki, and Tokoyami all standing around his bed, staring at him. \n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Izuku groans, rubbing at his oddly aching back. Did he sleep in some sort of weird position that left him sore?\n\u201c...you were floating,\u201d Kaminari says slowly. \u201cI came in, and you were floating.\u201d \n\u201cI was what?\u201d Izuku retorts skeptically. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019ve been getting enough sleep?\u201d \n\u201cYou were definitely floating,\u201d Todoroki speaks up. \u201cThat\u2019s why your back is hurting now.\u201d Izuku abruptly stops rubbing his back. Todoroki leans in, his mismatched eyes gleaming in a way that Izuku, with a sinking heart, recognizes as the certified Conspiracy Eyes\u2122. In a voice of grave seriousness, he says, \u201cI think that this dorm is haunted.\u201d \n\u201c...even if I was floating,\u201d Izuku says, \u201cit was almost certainly because of Uraraka. She probably made me float in her sleep.\u201d \n\u201cUraraka\u2019s awake,\u201d Todoroki tells him. \u201cAnd we already brought her in here to try to release you. It didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d \n\u201cUraraka\u2019s awake?\u201d Izuku scrambles up to a sitting position. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d \nTodoroki checks his watch. \u201cEight o\u2019clock?\u201d \n\u201cAll Might\u2019s Premium Silver Age Hoodies, why didn\u2019t anyone wake me up? I\u2019m supposed to go on morning runs on Saturdays!\u201d \n\u201cI was coming in to wake you up, but I got distracted,\u201d Kaminari explains. \u201cYou know, because you were floating in your sleep.\u201d \n\u201cAnyway, you\u2019re one of the fittest people in our class,\u201d Todoroki says matter-of-factly. \u201cYou can afford to miss a day.\u201d Izuku feels heat spread over his face, and he stutters out some sort of awkward, flustered thank you. \n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m just gonna uh. Get up,\u201d Izuku says, reaching over to flick on the light. At first, it won\u2019t turn on, then abruptly and without anyone touching it, the light bulb starts burning at twice or three times the usual brightness. \n\u201cDefinitely haunted,\u201d Tokoyami tells Todoroki, who nods solemnly. Izuku, reaching under his bed for a sock, pretends that he couldn\u2019t hear them. \n\u00a0\nVIII. \nIzuku had just returned from his unfortunately late run (yes Izuku is still bitter about Kaminari deciding to bring Tokoyami and Todoroki in to stare at him instead of waking him up) when Iida gathers the class in the dining room. \n\u201cAs you all know,\u201d Iida announces, \u201cToday is a Saturday, meaning we have plenty of free time for studying. This upcoming week, we have a history test in Snipe-Sensei\u2019s class on Wednesday, an English essay due on Thursday, and our reports in Modern Art History due on Friday. If any of you need help with any of these upcoming assignments, please speak up now so we can arrange study groups!\u201d He chops his hand down for emphasis. \n\u201cHonestly,\u201d Ashido speaks up, \u201cthis week doesn\u2019t have anything too difficult. I don\u2019t need help with anything.\u201d \nThere\u2019s a chorus of agreement. \n\u201cIn that case, we can work on our hero training together,\u201d Iida suggests gamely. Izuku can see Ashido and Kaminari exchanging a glance and suppressing groans, and he can\u2019t blame them. He doesn\u2019t think anywhere aside for Iida is so eager to do schoolwork on the weekend. \n\u201cOr,\u201d Todoroki speaks up, \u201cwe can investigate the mystery that Kaminari uncovered.\u201d \nIzuku muffles a groan in his hands. He isn\u2019t exactly eager to work on schoolwork at the moment, but this is about a thousand times worse. \nWith the air of Sherlock Holmes revealing the identity of a previously uncaught murderer, Todoroki announces, \u201cI have a theory that the dorm is haunted.\u201d\nThe room immediately bursts into excited chatter. \n\u201cThat would explain why my Endeavor merchandise keeps on disappearing!\u201d Kirishima gasps. Todoroki shifts uncomfortably. \n\u201cIt would explain why it\u2019s always so cold in here,\u201d Asui muses. \u201cEven when Todoroki isn\u2019t using his right side, and the heater\u2019s on, it gets really cold in here sometimes.\u201d She shivers, rubbing her arms. \u201cI have to be really careful about wearing enough layers, kero.\u201d \n\u201cI have heard some weird\u2026 whispers at night,\u201d Jirou agrees. \u201cThey\u2019re really quiet, and kind of\u2026 static-y, but I can tell that whoever it is, they aren\u2019t anyone from Class 1-A.\u201d \n\u201cThere are probably reasonable explanations for all of these things,\u201d Izuku tries. Todoroki sends him a glance that, although it may look deadpan to others, clearly conveys Todoroki\u2019s plea of don\u2019t tell Kirishima I\u2019ve been methodically replacing his Endeavor merchandise while he sleeps. Izuku raises his eyebrow back. You should have thought about that when you told the whole class that the dorm\u2019s haunted, that raised eyebrow equally clearly tells Todoroki. \n\u201cThere definitely is a reasonable explanation!\u201d Ashido cheers. Izuku lets out an inaudible sigh of relief. \u201cClearly, Todoroki\u2019s right and there is a ghost!\u201d Izuku very narrowly avoids facepalming. \n\u201cWe should contact them!\u201d Hagakure cheers. \u201cYaomomo can use her quirk to make a Oujia board for us!\u201d \n\u201cOr,\u201d Izuku suggests in a weak voice, \u201cwe could not do that.\u201d \n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Kirishima says as he gives Izuku\u2019s hair a friendly ruffle, \u201cWe\u2019ll protect you from any ghosts! It wouldn\u2019t be manly not to!\u201d \nMaybe, Izuku thinks as he watches helplessly while Yaoyorozu looks up the blueprints for a Ouija board, One for All won\u2019t reveal itself. After all, it\u2019s in One for All\u2019s best interest to stay a secret, right? Would One for All really jeopardize that just to scare his classmates? \n...Izuku remembers hiding behind a pile of rubble with the others, frantically biting down the urge to jump out of behind his shelter and start cursing All for One out. Yeah, he\u2019s pretty sure that One for All really would jeopardize its secret nature just to scare his classmates. \nAsshole quirk, Izuku thinks. A deathly cold phantom wind ruffles his hair affectionately in response.\nWith growing trepidation, Izuku watches as the class gathers around the Ouija board, everyone packing in so that they can put their hands on the planchette. \n\u201cAre you gonna join us, Midoriya-kun?\u201d Ojiro asks. \n\u201cYou should!\u201d Hagakure cheers. \u201cIt\u2019ll be so much fun!\u201d \nReluctantly, Izuku reaches over and places one of his fingers on the planchette. As soon as Izuku touches the planchette, it starts moving, zipping across the board faster than Gran Torino bouncing off the walls. \nWhat if, Izuku thinks aggressively in One for All\u2019s direction, you didn\u2019t fucking do that. \n\u201cAs I said,\u201d Todoroki says with an air of satisfaction. \u201cDorm\u2019s haunted.\u201d \nW-E-H-A-T-E, the planchette begins. \n\u201cOh shit,\u201d Sero mutters, face pale. \u201cThis was such a bad idea. Why did I let Todoroki persuade me to do this? He hasn\u2019t even watched any horror movies, he\u2019s clearly not qualified to make these types of decisions!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m too young to die!\u201d Kaminari wails. \n\u2014T-H-E-S-C-R-O-U-G-E-O-F-K-A-M-I-N-O, the planchette finishes.\nKacchan barks a laugh. \u201cThe ghost\u2019s got taste!\u201d \n\u201cWe don\u2019t know for sure if it\u2019s a ghost or not,\u201d Izuku quickly jumps in. \u201cPlanchettes move because of subconscious micro-gestures by the people holding onto them, not because of ghosts.\u201d As he speaks, he subtly lifts his finger from the planchette. Hopefully, without the physical connection, One for All will run out of steam. Hopefully.\nKacchan points at the planchette, which is currently rapidly bouncing across the board as it quite colorfully cusses All for One out. Iida is shouting about school appropriate language, but the planchette doesn\u2019t seem to be listening. \u201cYou think that that\u2019s \u2018subconscious micro gestures\u2019?\u201d \n\u201c...I think we all have a lot of subconscious hatred for the Scourge of Kamino,\u201d Izuku replies weakly.\n\u00a0\nIX. \nNo matter how he\u2019s pressed, Izuku will always insist that the dorms are not, in fact, haunted. This is simply because he\u2019s a logical, rational person who doesn\u2019t believe in something as foolish as ghosts, and is definitely not because of some sort of ulterior motive. Either way, the end result is the same; Izuku Midoriya will never admit that the dorms are haunted.\nHowever, whether or not Class 1-A is cursed is a different matter entirely, and right now, as they watch the door to the convenience store slam open and a villain that had been on the news that morning sweep in, Izuku is pretty sure that Aizawa-Sensei is right. They are cursed; only they could get into a villain fight on what was supposed to be a quick snack run. \nIzuku falls into a fighting stance, and he can see the others around him similarly readying themselves for battle\u2014 Jirou lifts her headphone jacks threateningly, Sero shoves his hoodie sleeves up so that his elbows are easily accessible, and Izuku can see Sato subtly gulping down a boxful of candy from his bag of snacks. \nThe villain, who had proclaimed himself Astral on the news that morning, laughs lightly. \u201cNow, we can\u2019t have that, can we,\u201d he asks rhetorically. With a wave of his hand, smoke fills the room, and the world is slipping away from Izuku as darkness consumes his vision. \nAstral chuckles and waves a hand to his sidekick. These hero students will fetch a pretty penny on the black market, he knows. His quirk made the whole operation as easy as stealing candy from a baby. \nHe frowns. Galore isn\u2019t walking in; there\u2019s a slightly wary look on his face as he hesitates by the entrance to the store. \u201cDon\u2019t worry!\u201d he calls. \u201cI\u2019ve astral projected them all right out of here. They\u2019re no threat!\u201d \n\u201cAre you sure about that?\u201d Galore asks. \nAstral turns. One of the hero students, a plain boy with green hair, seems to be waking up. If Astral remembers correctly, he\u2019s Midoriya Izuku, a first year with a powerful, though self-destructive strength quirk. Best to take him down before he can damage the merchandise. \nAstral reaches out for his quirk, ready to sever the connection between Midoriya and his body. But it\u2019s already severed. Whatever it is that\u2019s inside the boy, it isn\u2019t Midoriya. \nThe boy\u2019s eyes open. Where there used to be green irises and black pupils, there\u2019s now just a blind expanse of white-hot light. Green lightning crackles at the corners of his eyes, and there\u2019s a feral, too-white smile stretching across his face. Behind him, Astral can hear Galore taking a stumbling step back. \nThe boy rises to his feet, every movement suddenly imbued with far more grace than had been evident from Midoriya during the Sports Festival. \n \u201cWHERE\u2019S MY USER?\u201d the thing residing within the body of the boy asks in an echoing voice. \u201cWHAT DID YOU DO TO NINE?\u201d\nThe body of the boy takes a step forward, lightning crackling around it threateningly. The smile that, on Midoriya, had looked friendly if a bit anxious, is now an animal baring of teeth. \n\u201cI f-forced his spirit to t-the astral plane,\u201d Astral replies. \u201cI-I can bring him back.\u201d \nThe thing within the body of the boy eyes him consideringly for a moment. \u201cBRING BACK NINE\u2019S CLASSMATES, AS WELL.\u201d \n\u201cY-yes, of course.\u201d Hands shaking, Astral reaches out for the hero students\u2019 spirits and drags them back to their bodies. He can see Midoriya\u2019s spirit crashing into his body, can see it by the way his irises and pupils return and the lightning sizzling around him dims. Still, now that he\u2019s seen Midoriya\u2019s spirit stripped away, it\u2019s hard not to notice how his scleras remain just a little bit too bright, how the air is colder around him, how there\u2019s still the feeling of a consciousness outside of Midoriya watching him. \n\u201cM-my apologies,\u201d Astral manages as he quickly bows. Grabbing onto Galore, the two of them flee before the thing possessing Midoriya can change its mind. \nMidoriya, meanwhile, shrugs and picks up his groceries. He can already hear Todoroki telling Kaminari how this is evidence that they\u2019re being haunted in the background, but One for All took care of the situation quickly enough so that they won\u2019t miss curfew, so he\u2019s not even mad this time. \nThis time, he reminds sternly. He doesn\u2019t want One for All to get any ideas.\n\u00a0\nX. \nAll Might Above, Izuku knew he shouldn\u2019t have said that thing about not being mad at One for All for possessing him. Ever since the snack run, One for All has been acting like a two-bit poltergeist working overtime in hopes of getting a raise. \nEvery time Izuku sets foot into a room, the temperature immediately drops to the approximate warmth of a refrigerator in Antarctica. Electronics he touch at best explode and at worst start emitting staticky rants about All for One. That\u2019s not even touching onto the visual effects, either. Izuku has to be very careful about mirrors since his reflection now seems to always feature a) glowing white eyes and green lightning and/or b) a bunch of glowing figures standing behind him. Also, his shadow refuses to stop writhing menacingly no matter how often Izuku scolds One for All about the importance of keeping secrets and not scaring his classmates, and Koda\u2019s rabbit seems to be absolutely terrified of him. \nNo matter how hard Izuku tries, no one seems to believe his alternative explanations for all of these oddities. He mentions broken heating units, suggests some sort of issue with their electricity, and points out that his writhing shadows might just be a trick of the light, but all of his explanations just seem to make Todoroki and the others double down. It\u2019s only when they start talking about holding a seance that Izuku thinks of an explanation that just might work. \n\u201cI think,\u201d Izuku says slowly, \u201cThat this is Class 1-B playing a prank on us.\u201d \nThe room goes silent as everyone spins to look at him. Izuku elaborates, counting off his points on his fingertips. \n\u201cThere\u2019s a business student who has technopathy as a quirk; Monoma could easily copy that and use that to make it seem like someone is haunting our electronics. Additionally, Shihai has a quirk called Black which allows him to merge and manipulate black things, so he could easily be the one making my shadows\u2026 well\u2026\u201d \nHe nods to his shadow, which is currently imitating Cthulhu on a rampage. \n\u201cReiko could easily have used her quirk, Poltergeist, to move the planchette without it being visible to any of us. Plus, Kosei could use his quirk, Solid Air, to move cold air into our dorms without anyone knowing. Reiko\u2019s quirk has a weight limit that\u2019s a bit under my weight, but the two of them could probably work together to make it look like I was floating.\u201d\nFor a moment Todoroki\u2019s brow furrows, then his eyes gleam with the holy light of a Todoroki Conspiracy\u2122. \u201cHe has a point,\u201d Todoroki admits. \n\u201cHe does,\u201d Ashido agrees. Her eyes are also shining, but unlike Todoroki\u2019s, it\u2019s with mischief. \u201cI think that we should prank them back!\u201d \nThe room almost immediately breaks out into discussion. Iida jumps up, chopping his hand up and down to draw their attention. \u201cWe\u2019ll put it to a vote!\u201d He proclaims. \u201cAll in favor of retaliating against Class 1-B, say aye!\u201d \nThe entire class almost immediately shouts \u201cAYE!\u201d \nIida nods, his face as serious as if this is any other school event that he needs to plan. \u201cWe should also vote on which prank, specifically, we should play. Does anyone have suggestions?\u201d \nIzuku hesitantly raises a hand. \u201cWe could stick all of their furniture to the ceiling,\u201d he suggests. \u201cIt\u2019d be difficult for them to get down, but it wouldn\u2019t be too hard for us to do, since we have so many people with quirks that help with mobility and/or strength.\u201d \n\u201cI can persuade Vlad-Sensei to take Class 1-B on an outing so that we\u2019ll have plenty of time to do it,\u201d Aoyama volunteers. \u201cIt should be tr\u00e8s facile for someone as charismatic as me.\u201d\n\u201cI can check to make sure that there are no stragglers in there before we sneak in!\u201d Hagakure cheers. \n\u201cI can electrocute the security cameras so that the teachers won\u2019t be able to see what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Kaminari offers.\n\u201cEveryone in favor of sticking Class 1-B\u2019s furniture to the ceiling, vote aye!\u201d Iida calls. \nOnce again, the vote is unanimous. \nMonths of working together make the class an efficient team. After Hagaruke has swept the area to confirm that no 1-B students are there to witness their mischief-making, Iida and Yaoyorozu move through the rooms of the 1-B dorm, methodically noting down the precise location of each item so they can recreate the floorplan on the ceiling. Once that\u2019s done, Hagakure and Jirou station themselves outside of the dorm to keep watch for teachers while everyone else sets to work. \nAshido busies herself in the bathrooms and kitchen, using her acid to cut the toilets, sinks, and bathtubs from the floors. Meanwhile, Yaoyorozu creates special extra-strong glue to attach the furniture to the ceilings. In the living room, Uraraka lightens heavy objects so they\u2019re easier to maneuver, and Satou helps Uraraka not overburden herself by helping lift some of the heavy objects. \nAt the same time, Sero uses his tape to easily bring himself and 1-B\u2019s furniture up to the ceiling, and Kacchan does something similar with his explosions. Additionally, Dark Shadow\u2019s excellent mobility makes him a dab hand at placing objects in difficult spots, and whenever they encounter something with liquid that would spill if it was upside down, Todoroki solves the problem by freezing it solid. \nBy the end of the day, everyone is satisfied with the results of their hard work. As the cherry on top, Izuku is relieved to note that this whole \u201chaunted dorms\u201d thing has finally been put to rest. \nAt least. He hopes so. \n\u00a0\nXI. \nAccording to the teachers, their honestly harmless prank means that class rivalry at UA is \u201cout of hand\u201d, they\u2019re all \u201cproblem children who are only moderately better than Midoriya,\u201d and they need to \u201cbond\u201d. Hence why the two classes are having a joint class taught by both Aizawa-Sensei and Vlad-Sensei. \nIzuku can see where they\u2019re coming from\u2014 he has to admit that maybe the bit with cutting the permanent fixtures like the sinks and toilets off of the floor had been a bit over the top\u2014 but at the same time, he really doesn\u2019t think that inter-class sparring is the way to fix the issue. \nMonoma doesn\u2019t appear to think that this is prime time bonding either, but he also doesn\u2019t seem to mind the real outcome too much. Judging by the way that he\u2019s been staring at Izuku like a hyperactive lapdog looking at a squirrel it wants to chase for the entirety of their teachers\u2019 lecture, he really, really wants to spar with Izuku. \nIzuku sighs internally. The things he does for his teachers. \nAs predicted, the moment that Aizawa-Sensei is finished speaking, Monoma appears in front of Izuku, a smarmy grin stretched across his face. \u201cWant to spar, Golden Boy?\u201d \nIzuku eyes him warily. He doesn\u2019t particularly enjoy spending time within a five-foot radius of Monoma, but One for All is yanking him towards Monoma like a dog dragging its owner in the direction of the dog park. This is going to end badly, isn\u2019t it. \u201c...sure,\u201d Izuku replies. \nThey square up, each one falling into their fighting stances. Kendou, who\u2019s standing off to the side, counts down from three. On two, Monoma sprints forward, slapping Izuku\u2019s cheek. Izuku tries to hold onto One for All, but it slips out of his hold with the delight of a flea jumping onto a particularly sweet-blooded new host. \n\u201cGot your quirk!\u201d Monoma crows. It\u2019s the last thing he says before suddenly his eyes roll back in his head and are replaced by a glowing expanse of white nothingness. \n\u201cMORE LIKE THIS QUIRK HAS YOU,\u201d seven overlapping voices note in amusement. Monoma\u2019s hand, which is sizzling with green lightning, lifts into the air, and Monoma\u2019s body starts slapping itself in the face.  \u201cWHY ARE YOU HITTING YOURSELF? WHY ARE YOU HITTING YOURSELF? WHY ARE YOU HITTING YOURSELF?\u201d One for All asks in a deadpan voice.\nIzuku sighs. He knew this was a bad idea. With the long-suffering air of a mother coming to pick up their child from school after they got suspended, Izuku approaches and holds out his hand. Aizawa-Sensei, watching incredulously from across the yard, is reminded of a teacher asking a delinquent student to hand over the contraband they\u2019re clearly hiding. \nThe thing wearing Monoma\u2019s body pouts, but it reaches out and slaps Izuku\u2019s hand with little fuss. For a moment, both of the boys\u2019 eyes glow with the bright white light of eight exploding stars, and then the two of them are back to normal. \n\u201cYour quirk is fucking haunted,\u201d Monoma gasps as he scrambles back from Izuku. \n\u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Izuku deadpans dryly. \u201cIt\u2019s the dorms that are haunted, not my quirk.\u201d \nAs he walks away, his writhing shadow gives Monoma the middle finger."
