Only took me nearly four months...sorry about the wait</p>\n<p>Also, last chapter, it...kind of slipped my mind to have a little moment in there about WCZ reacting to JFM's death? So it might have seemed like he was indifferent, but trust me, he was devastated. Just...imagine that he found out off screen, and so said devastation happened off screen. I decided to add a little scene in here with Cangse to make up for it haha</p>\n<p>Also, I've started posting updates about my fics on my tumblr, so you can check that out if you like: pupeez4eva.tumblr.com</p>\n<p>Also I've started to use my twitter account more, mostly to retweet a bunch of MDZS stuff, but I'm also probably going to start posting about updates, ect. on there soon...possibly even posting snippets of future chapters, and fics?

    "text": "It took Wei Changze a while to fully realise what was happening. The first year or so was a muddled mess, his consciousness flickering back and forth as the mind of a newborn baby struggled to cope with the full range of memories from his past self.\nWhen things started to become clearer, he realised that he was in a labour camp. There were people in gold robes, Jins, milling around with whips and sneers on their faces. Wei Changze was cradled in the arms of a woman who looked far too old for this environment, surrounded by people who looked weak and broken.\nHe remembered that last night hunt. He remembered kissing Wei Ying on the forehead before he left, and he remembered the sound of his little boy\u2019s peeling laughter mixing in with the sound of his wife\u2019s as she tossed him in the air, a vibrant smile on her face.\nHe remembered kissing Cangse before the hunt had begun, remembered the lingering feel of her lips against his. He remembered thinking that they would need to start making plans to move to the next town soon, because Yiling always got cold in the winter, and neither Cangse nor A-Ying liked the cold very much. It was one of the perks of being rogue cultivators, and always being able to move around as much as they liked.\u00a0\nCangse hated being in the one place, and after years of being by her side, Wei Changze had learnt to appreciate that too.\nThe details of the hunt were less clear, but he remembered a sudden, sharp pain as the creature overpowered him, and the sound of Cangse\u2019s horrified scream. He remembered something cold and wet sliding down his side, and the sound of something falling beside him; and when he turned his head, he remembered seeing Cangse lying next to him, her eyes wide and seeing.\nHe didn\u2019t like to remember any of that.\nThe body he found himself in now was no longer his own. He was tall before, with broad shoulders, a strong build, and callused hands from holding a sword for years. He\u2019d worn purple once, when he had stood by Jiang Fengmian\u2019s side as his right hand man, and then he had worn black after he had married Cangse.\nNow, he found himself in the body of a child. He was small, weak and malnourished from the harsh conditions of the camp. He vaguely remembered a gentle woman, and a smiling man, who might have been his parents in this life, but those memories were blurry at best. The gentle woman and smiling man were no longer here, and instead there was the old woman, who held him in an embrace that was strong and protective despite her weak body.\n\u201cA-Yuan,\u201d the woman - Granny - called him, her expression gentle and loving, despite the wariness on her face.\u00a0\n\u201cWen Dog,\u201d \u00a0a Jin cultivator called out to him, and tried to kick him. Granny stepped in front of him, shielding him with her body, and was rewarded with a face full of dirt for her efforts.\nApparently the world was even more cruel than he remembered it. In his previous life he was Wei Changze, a servant, the husband of Cangse Sanren, the father of Wei Ying. In this life he was Wen Yuan, and he had no idea what the rest of it would entail.\n\u2026\nThey were rescued and brought to the Burial Mounds. Their saviour was a man with Cangse\u2019s eyes and Cangse\u2019s smile, and they call him Wei Wuxian. Wei Changze remembered sitting with Cangse, their newborn son cradled in her arms, and discussing possible courtesy names.\nCangse had loved the idea of Wuxian. Apparently her idea had been realised.\nHis son was tall, and handsome, and wonderful. He was also apparently a demonic cultivator, who had permanently relocated to the Burial Mounds of all places.\nWei Changze really should be concerned. For a moment, all he could think was, \u2018This is definitely something Cangse would do.\u2019\u00a0\nWei Ying cooed at him, just like Cangse used to do to their son basically every time she saw him.\u00a0\n\u201cThe cutest little thing ever,\u201d she\u2019d always declare, her eyes shining.\nApparently he was supposed to be the child here, and it was the strangest, most surreal experience ever, to have his own child holding him in his arms, looking at him like he was the cutest thing ever.\nWei Changze could see dark circles under Wei Ying\u2019s eyes, and the slight strain to his smile.\u00a0\n\u201cA-Ying, go take a nap,\u201d he wanted to say, and then remembered that his son was no longer a child. He could also see the other members of his current family milling around, and he supposed that they were stressed out enough, what with the recent labour-camp-liberation, and the constant fear of death, without being concerned that the only toddler in the group was potentially possessed.\nWei Changze gave Wei Ying the best toothy smile he could muster. Wei Ying let out a peal of delighted laughter, and it reminded him so much of Cangse that his heart hurt.\n\u2026\nSo apparently his son wasn\u2019t just a demonic cultivator, but might also potentially be insane.\nWei Changze felt kind of guilty for thinking that, but the fact remained that Wei Ying was trying to return consciousness to a fierce corpse.\n(When Wei Ying eventually managed to do this, Wei Changze would happily admit that he had been too quick to judge. Right now, he was a concerned father in the body of a toddler).\u00a0\n\u201cA-Ying,\u201d Wei Changze said, tugging on the back of Wei Ying\u2019s robes. He wasn\u2019t sure what he wanted to say - \u201cA-Ying, leave the corpse and go and eat your vegetables?\u201d\u00a0\nWei Ying looked amused. \u201cWho told you to call me A-Ying, huh? I\u2019m your senior, you should treat me with more respect!\u201d\nWei Changze blinked.\n\u201cI told you to call me Xian-gege, didn\u2019t I?\u201d\nOh, this was far too strange. \u201cXian-gege,\u201d he said, with some reluctance. He didn\u2019t want to call his son Xian-gege, he wants to call his son \u2018A-Ying\u2019, or \u2018My little baby boy,\u2019 like he often did to make Wei Ying laugh. He was fairly certain that this Wei Ying would be very concerned if he did so.\u00a0\n\u201cXian-gege, come have dinner.\u201d\n\u201cIn a second, A-Yuan,\u201d Wei Ying said, smiling at him. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to fix your Ning-gege up first, okay?\u201d\n\u2018Ning-gege is a corpse,\u2019 Wei Changze thought. He vaguely remembered Wen Ning from the camp; he\u2019d been a quiet, nervous boy, and then he\u2019d been dead.\u00a0\nHe was definitely dead.\u00a0\nWei Ying seemed to have a hard time accepting that.\nWei Changze walked back to the where the rest of the Wens were having their meals. The food was meagre at best, but it was all they had. He glanced at the current offerings, and grabbed a radish that didn\u2019t look spoiled.\u00a0\n\u201cHere,\u201d he said, nudging Wei Ying, and then passing the vegetable over when Wei Ying turned to look down at him.\u00a0\nWei Changze really didn\u2019t think that Wei Ying should be having his meals next to a corpse, but then, he didn\u2019t seem eager to move anytime soon either.\nWei Ying\u2019s expression softened. \u201cAww,\u201d he said, \u201clook at my little A-Yuan, so concerned about his Xian-gege!\u201d\nSomeone needed to be.\n\u2026\nAbout a month onwards, and Wei Changze still didn\u2019t know much about how Wei Ying had been raised, or where he had grown up. The fact that he had Wuxian as a courtesy name give him hope that Fengmian had raised him, since his best friend had been the only person he and his wife had shared that name with.\nSo maybe things weren\u2019t so bad. Wei Ying looked drawn out and tired these days, but maybe his son was just predisposed to looking like that. And maybe this whole \u2018living in a mass graveyard\u2019 thing was just a phase.\nThen someone wearing Jiang Sect purple showed up and stabbed his son.\nWei Changze diligently helped to clean the wound, while finding himself silently cursing the Jiang Sect for the first time in existence.\u00a0\n\n\u2018Fengmian, I\u2019m sorry, but I might actually have to kill someone from your sect very soon.\u2019\n\nWen Qing huffed and snapped at him to go away and play, and to leave them so that she could finish her work. Wei Changze shot her a flat look, and told her very plainly that he wouldn\u2019t be going anywhere.\nWen Qing sighed, and then reached down, picked him up, and deposited him outside of the cave.\nWei Changze scowled, missing the days when he\u2019d been an actual adult. The sound of his son\u2019s laughter from inside settled his frustration somewhat.\n\u2026\nWei Ying buried Wei Changze in the dirt, cooing about how his A-Yuan needed to grow big and strong.\n\u201cA-Yuan, do you want to be big like your Xian-gege?\u201d Wei Ying asked, laughter in his voice. \u201cIf I bury you in the dirt, you\u2019ll grow big like those radishes over there!\u201d\n\n(\u201cA-Ying, if I bury you here, you\u2019ll grow big and strong like Daddy, alright?\u201d).\n\nGod, he was so much like his mother.\nThe thought made it hard for him to even protest, although he sorely regretted doing that when the feeling of cold dirt slithered up his robes. Wen Qing hollered from nearby, yelling at Wei Ying to stop messing around. The other Wens milled around, looking at him with amusement on their faces. Just a short while ago, they had been in a labour camp, uncertain of their future, with no hope in sight. Now, they laughed, they smiled, they lived. Wei Ying had given them that.\nWei Changze had missed most of his son\u2019s life, but it was clear a strong, honourable, wonderful man had emerged while he was gone.\nMaybe he treated resentful energy like it was a wilful pet, but then, even the most honourable of men could have their rebellious moments.\u00a0\nHe could feel dirt between his toes, in his toe nails, and oh god, maybe protesting this would be a good idea after all.\n\u2026\nThey bumped into the man from the Lan Sect by accident.\nWei Ying took him with him to town, needing to buy more food, and Wei Changze hurried away when he wasn\u2019t looking. He had a plan in mind, as vague as it was; Wei Ying hardly seemed to eat in the Burial Mounds, with Wei Changze having to basically force food down his throat these days (\u201cHonestly, who\u2019s the parent here, A-Yuan?\u201d \u201cXian-gege, just finish your dinner, please.\u201d), and Wei Changze decided that if he bought him some delicious, spicy food, then he wouldn\u2019t be able to resist.\nMaybe. His little A-Ying had never been able to say no to spicy food.\nOf course, it wasn\u2019t like he had any money on him, but maybe one of these vendors would take pity on a cute little toddler, who obviously hadn\u2019t had a good meal in days. Maybe they would just glare at him, and tell him to go away. At least he\u2019d feel better about snatching it from them when they weren\u2019t looking, if that were the case.\nHe wasn\u2019t really looking where he was going, so slamming straight into a solid wall of white robes wasn't entirely unexpected. He yelped, and fell to the ground. A man peered down at him, gold eyes wide and slightly familiar, and it took him a moment to recognise them as a distinctive feature of the main branch of the Lan Sect.\u00a0\n\u201cLan Zhan?\u201d\u00a0\nWei Ying wondered over, and Wei Changze silently cursed his luck. His son\u2019s gaze was focused on the other man, who was staring back at him with an impassive look on his face.\nApparently this \u2018Lan Zhan\u2019 was an acquaintance of Wei Ying\u2019s, but Wei Changze couldn\u2019t figure out what their exact relationship was. Wei Ying seemed to laugh and joke teasingly with him, but then, he did that with everyone. Lan Zhan wasn\u2019t giving him much to work with, remaining stoic and unmoving, and saying only the bare minimum.\nSomehow the three of them ended up having lunch together. It was one of the strangest meals he\u2019d ever had, and he had spent a year in Gusu with Fengmian in his youth.\n\u201cXian-gege will have the spiciest meal they have here,\u201d Wei Changze told Lan Zhan firmly.\nLan Zhan blinked. \u201cHe is very articulate,\u201d he told Wei Ying, who beamed proudly.\n\u201cYes, I know! You can thank me for that!\u201d\n\u2018I taught you to read and write,\u2019 Wei Changze thought, and cuddled closer to Wei Ying.\nWei Ying chatted away throughout the meal, his mind moving a mile at a minute, like it always had when he was a child. Lan Zhan\u2019s eyes remained glued to him the whole time, and Wei Changze quickly realised that, despite how stiff and distant this man seemed to be, perhaps he wasn\u2019t as dismissive of Wei Ying as he had initially feared.\nNo, he seemed almost too intent in his staring, almost like Wei Changze had been in those early days with Cangse, too in awe of basically everything about her to even bring himself to talk to her. She had been the one who had needled him, teased him, forced him out of his shell, while he had blushed, and choked, and struggled to get the words out.\n\u201cYou\u2019re Wei Changze, not Lan Qiren,\u201d she\u2019d laughed, eyes bright with amusement, and Wei Changze\u2019s heart had skipped a beat. \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to so awkward and stuffy!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI can\u2019t help it when I\u2019m around you,\u201d Wei Changze admitted, cheeks burning.\u00a0\nCangse had stopped laughing abruptly, her mouth posed in a perfect o, and then she\u2019d cried, \u201cChangze, what are you doing?! You\u2019re not allowed to make my heart beat this fast!\u201d\nHe missed her so damn much.\nWei Ying laughed, a wide, beaming smile on his face, his eyes focused solely on Lan Zhan. The Lan met his gaze with an intensity that neither of them seemed to notice.\nWei Changze shifted uncomfortably, suddenly feeling like he should not be here.\n\u2026\nSo maybe Wei Ying wasn\u2019t insane after all. Wei Changze allowed himself to feel a moment of relief, as he watched the now sentient fierce corpse ambling around as if he hadn\u2019t been dead just a short while ago.\nWen Qing was walking close by, and while she tried to maintain control of her emotions, her red-rimmed eyes, and the tear tracks on her face were obvious to everyone. When Wen Ning first had his consciousness fully returned, Wei Changze had heard Wen Qing\u2019s desperate and relieved sobs, as she thanked Wei Ying, and held her brother close.\u00a0\nHe had been told, \"A-Yuan, stay away while Xian-gege is working with Ning-gege, okay?\"\u00a0 Wei Changze hadn\u2019t even attempted to listen to that, because if his son was going to be conducting dangerous, potentially life-threatening experiments, then he was going to supervise.\u00a0\nWei Changze really didn\u2019t remember much about Wen Ning. His earliest years in his second life had been blurry at best, but he remembered Wen Ning as a shy, quiet boy who had almost been pre-conditioned to do terribly in a labor camp. The guards had been instantly drawn to him, as if sensing the perfect victim for them, and it now sent a wave of anger through Wei Changze.\nHe was wary at first, because he had come across a lot of bizarre and wonderful things during his life \u2014 his wife being one of them \u2014 but a sentient fierce corpse was definitely something new. But Wen Ning still seemed like the same shy, nervous boy from his memory, and the rest of the family laughed, smiled and welcomed him back.\nThat night at dinner, Wei Ying didn\u2019t even need any further prompting to finish his meal. He smiled from ear to ear, laughed as Uncle Four told a joke, and Granny tried to convince him to eat more, and talked excitedly with Wen Ning like the old friends that they were. Wei Changze sat perched on his lap, feeling the soft rumble of his chest as he laughed.\nHis second life was strange and confusing. Barely four years of it had passed, and he had already lived in both a labour camp and the Burial Mounds. He was family with a conscious fierce corpse, a woman who was more terrifying than the conscious fierce corpse, a small gaggle of people who had been treated worse than they ever deserved, but smiled more than most people he had met, and his son who seemed determine to insert himself as a parental figure in his life.\nThings were strange, confusing, and he felt very content with them.\n\u2026\nBy the time the invitation for the Jin Heir\u2019s one month celebration arrived, Wei Changze had more or less figured out the current state of the cultivation world; namely, just why they were all living in the Burial Mounds.\nHe was therefore very uncomfortable with the idea of his son entering what was essentially a den of vipers. These people wanted him dead, and Wei Ying was striding right into a room full of them.\nWei Changze\u2019s attempts to stop Wei Ying the morning of the party didn\u2019t go very far. Hiding his clothes didn\u2019t exactly work when there was a distinct lack of places to hide them in, hiding Jin Ling\u2019s gift seemed to bear the same results (Wei Ying pat him indulgently on the head, and cooed about how he\u2019d make him his own pretty bell the moment he got back), and simply asking him to stay just led to Wei Ying cuddling him a lot, and promising that \u201cXian-gege would be back to bury you in the soil before you even know it.\u201d\n\n\u2018Dammit Wei Ying, that\u2019s not the point!\u2019\u00a0\n\nWei Ying left with Wen Ning that morning, while Wei Changze sat perched in Granny\u2019s arms, waving solemnly.\u00a0\nHe waited a a few minutes after Wei Ying had left, and quickly ducked away when Granny was busy talking to Wen Qing, and followed behind him from a short distance away. Wen Qing would undoubtedly punish him when he got back, but it would be worth it.\u00a0\nIt ended up definitely being worth it, because it turned out he was right about the den of vipers. Apparently Wei Ying wouldn\u2019t even need to go all the way to Carp Tower for the first wave to attack, because they were already lined up along the way there, waiting to greet him with armfuls of bows and arrows.\u00a0\nWei Changze wasted no time in throwing himself forward, calling them a bunch of lying bastards who he would make sure suffered very much for what they had done. He didn\u2019t think the name calling was unfair, because what sort of people invited someone to a celebration, and then attempted to kill them off on the way there?\nWei Ying turned and stared at him in horror. Then another Jin entered the scene, as if Wei Changze wasn\u2019t sick enough with the colour gold by now.\u00a0\nThough Wei Changze would never know just how much his presence had changed things, the shock and confusion of his arrival had stopped any further attacks from Wei Ying and Wen Ning. Jin Zixuan managed to intervene with his own men, angrily telling his cousin to stand down, and return to Carp Tower immediately. Jin Zixun eventually complied, bitterly grumbling the whole time.\nWei Changze rested in Wei Ying\u2019s protective embrace, and shot Jin Zixuan a deadly glare.\n\u201cWhy is there a child here?\u201d Jin Zixuan asked, sounding horrified.\n\u2026\nThe presence of a toddler in the midst of a battle field had made Jin Zixuan realise that there were perhaps a few things he didn\u2019t know about the Wens in the Burial Mounds. Despite Wei Ying\u2019s protests, and the furious glares that said toddler continued to shoot him \u2014 or the very intimidating fierce corpse, standing unflinchingly by their side \u2014 he accompanied them back to the Burial Mounds, determined to see for himself what was really going on there.\nThis entire time, Jin Zixuan had been picturing a small gathering of young Wen cultivators. Even with his wife\u2019s assurances that her brother would never protect them unless they truly innocent, he hadn\u2019t been able to fully believe it until he was faced with a group of elderly men and women, who looked like they had never wielded a sword in their lives.\n\u201cWho are these people?\u201d Jin Zixuan asked, his voice shaky.\n\u201cWhy, the fearsome army of Wen cultivators, of course,\u201d Wei Ying replied, with mock-innocence in his voice.\nJin Zixuan blanched, his face very pale.\n\u2026\nAfter that, things changed considerably. It was all very fast, almost to the point where Wei Changze wasn\u2019t sure if he wanted them to change this much.\u00a0\nThough, it was probably better if his son stopped living in a cursed mass graveyard.\u00a0\nJin Zixuan, father of the baby whose one month celebration Wei Ying had never been able to attend \u2014 who was apparently also the baby of Wei Ying\u2019s beloved Shijie, Fengmian\u2019s daughter, who Wei Changze vaguely remembered from a trip to Lotus Pier years ago \u2014 went back to confront his father about why there had been non-cultivators, elderly people, and babies in his labour camps.\nThe news spread, and other sects started to learn that maybe the Yiling Patriarch wasn\u2019t so crazy and ruthless after all. A number of visits later, from so many different people that it almost made Wei Changze territorial over their home, it was decided that Wei Ying apparently wasn\u2019t an awful, murdering psychopath (and Wei Changze would destroy whoever had decided to call his son that), and that the Wens were deserving of protection, and plans were made to allow them to leave the Burial Mounds.\nWei Changze was really hoping for Yunmeng. It would be nice to move back to his old home, though he would have to punch the angry purple man who had stabbed his son at least once, even though the whole thing had apparently been staged, and even though said angry purple man was apparently his best friend\u2019s son.\nWhen Lan Zhan \u2014 who turned out to be Lan Wangji, Hanguang-Jun, Second Master of the Lan Sect, and nephew of \u201cThat stuffy old Goat,\u201d as Cangse would fondly say \u2014 ended up declaring his undying love (in the most awkward, stilted way possible, to the point that the unfortunate witnesses had honestly wondered if he would ever get the words out) and Wei Ying, with stars in his eyes, said that he felt the same, it became apparent that they would not be going to Yunmeng after all.\nNo, Gusu would be their new home.\nWei Changze honestly had nothing against the Lan Sect. He imagined that Cangse would have a few things to say about it, but Wei Ying looked like he was floating on a cloud, cheeks tinted pink, gaze soft, smile wide and beaming as he stood curled in Lan Wangji\u2019s arms, and Wei Changze decided that he could deal with wearing mourning robes for the rest of his life, if only to see his son look like that from now on.\nWhen Wei Ying and Lan Wangji tried to elope shortly after they had officially relocated to the Cloud Recesses, Jiang Cheng threatened to kill the both of them if they even thought about it. Wei Changze was pretty sure he wasn\u2019t serious, which was why he didn\u2019t immediately start plotting a plan of attack.\n\u201cA-Yuan, do you like your new home?\u201d Wei Ying asked, smiling brightly at him. They sat in the middle of a wide meadow, filled to the brim with rabbits, and Wei Changze definitely didn\u2019t remember this being here the last time he had been in the Cloud Recesses.\nHe was perched in Wei Ying\u2019s lap, while Wei Ying lay his head on Lan Wangji\u2019s shoulder, a soft, content look on his face.\nWei Ying was happy, the Wens were safe, and Lan Wangji seemed like the decent sort of man who would love and look after his son for the rest of their lives. Wei Changze didn\u2019t think he had anything to complain about.\nHe thought about a woman with shining silver eyes, wild dark hair, a loud, teasing laugh, and a smile he had only seen matched on their son\u2019s face. His heart clenched.\n\u201cI love it,\u201d he told Wei Ying, smiling.\u00a0\nCangse Sanren didn\u2019t remember much before dying. There was a flash of pain, a quick, \u2018Huh, I didn\u2019t see that one coming,\u2019 and then she was falling to the ground, and the world around her disappeared.\u00a0\nThe next few years of her second life were a blur, and when she finally regained control of her senses she would be more than grateful for that. After all, who would want to have vivid memories of feeding off some unknown woman\u2019s breast \u2014 regardless if said \u2018unknown woman\u2019 was her new mother \u2014 or being stuck in a cot, swaddled in blankets, and unable to move?\nCangse had never thought too much about what reincarnation might be like, but she\u2019d never imagined that she would have vivid memories of everything that had happened in her previous life. It was honestly awful, especially when all she could think about in that first year were her husband and child, and whether they were okay, and whether Wei Changze had made it out of that night hunt alive.\nShe hadn\u2019t seen him get hurt, so she could only hope that he had managed to kill the beast and make it back to Wei Ying unscathed. He would undoubtedly be devastated, but devastated was better than dead. The thought of her husband dying alongside her, and their little, defenceless child, all alone, with no one who would even know to look for him \u2014\nWell. She didn\u2019t like to think about it too much, or it made her feel like she was on the brink of an anxiety attack. Wei Changze and Wei Ying were both fine, and as soon as she was capable of leaving this damn mountain on her own, she would find a way to track them down, and very calmly explain that this was their wife/mother in the body of a little boy. Yes, this wasn\u2019t exactly normal, but then, when had anything she had ever done been normal?\n(She was actually not too bothered about being reborn in a male body. She could adapt. The fact that she was reborn as a Lan was a far more pressing matter).\n\u2026\nHer new name was Lan Jingyi. Jingyi was an alright name as far as new names went. Lan was not. Cangse had never had a proper last name \u2014 she was young when her Master had found her, and she barely remembered her life before that. Cangse Sanren was a title, and she had always been Cangse to her husband. She\u2019d toyed around with taking his name, liking the idea of Wei Cangse, but had never gotten around to it.\nNow she was stuck as a Lan, and she must have done something wrong in her past life to deserve this. Was this because of that time she\u2019d called Yu Ziyuan an old cow behind her back? To be fair, the woman had been insinuating that she\u2019d been flirting with her husband, as if Cangse would ever see Jiang Fengmian as anything more than a good friend and surrogate brother.\nWell, regardless of whether Yu Ziyuan had cursed her or not, Cangse was now stuck in this body. She was stuck in these awful white mourning robes, and would be cursed to a life of looking like a monk. Soon, she would have the blood-flow to her brain restricted with one of those forehead ribbons, and, even more horrifically, she would be reminded of the Gusu Lan rules for the rest of her second life.\nThey could remind her as much as they liked, they could try and drill them into her if they thought they had the time for it \u2014 it didn\u2019t mean she actually had to listen to any of them.\nHuh. Maybe this wouldn\u2019t be so bad after all. She could probably drive those stuffy Lan Elders crazy. If they were anything like that old goat Lan Qiren \u2014\u00a0\nOh. Her eyes widened, almost comically. Her mother let out a cooing noise, gushing about how cute she looked, and Cangse smiled her most adorable smile, and pretended that she wasn\u2019t silently plotting the best way to shave off Lan Qiren\u2019s goatee again.\n\u2026\nLan Qiren was practically apocalyptic when he woke up to find his goatee mysteriously vanished.\nOf course, no one suspected a three year old toddler of committing such a terrible crime. Cangse did her best to look as innocent as possible as her father shook his head, and muttered about how disrespectful children were these days. Apparently Lan Qiren was interrogating the junior disciples; Cangse felt slightly guilty, but then she remembered Lan Qiren\u2019s expression when she\u2019d seen him pass by that morning, and oh, it was worth it.\u00a0\nIf they weren\u2019t all so brainwashed, she was sure those juniors would agree with her. She was one of them now; she would just have to teach them better.\n\u2026\nWhen Cangse found out about Jiang Fengmian\u2019s death, she spent a good portion of the day searching for the Lan secret alcohol stash. She didn\u2019t find it, because it apparently didn\u2019t exist, and wasn\u2019t that just awful?\nShe needed something to get her mind off all of this though. She didn\u2019t want to think about how one of her closest friends was dead, or about how she had barely seen him in the years before her death, because dealing with him meant dealing with his wife, and that was just exhausting.\nShe didn\u2019t know how Fengmian had died, had only heard about it in passing, and the senior disciple who had mentioned it had only looked at her in concern when she\u2019d tried to press for more information.\nJiang Fengmian was dead, had been for a few years now. His son was the new leader of the Jiang Sect, and if that was true, then a considerable amount of time must have passed since her own death.\nShe hated this. She hated being stuck here, away from her husband, away from her son, away from the life she had once known. She hated not knowing if they were okay.\nShe thought about Jiang Fengmian, who had been one of her first friends since leaving her Master\u2019s mountain; Jiang Fengmian, who had accompanied her and Changze on all of their adventures, until the requirements of a Sect Leader, and of marriage, had finally called him back. Jiang Fengmian who, even throughout the following years of distance, had always remained her friend.\nHe was dead now and, to her, he\u2019d only just been alive. So had Wei Changze, so had Wei Ying.\nWere they still alive? And, would she ever have any way of knowing? She had heard about Jiang Fengmian\u2019s death in passing gossip, but who would discuss the fates of a servant and his son?\nShe\u2019d find some way back to them, she decided resolutely. She didn\u2019t know how long it would take her, but as soon as she was able to escape this place and make it all the way to the bottom without being caught and dragged back, then she would leave and find her boys again.\n\u2026\nApparently she didn't have to wait that long to see her boys again, not that she knew it at the time.\nWhen the announcement of the wedding between Hanguang-Jun and the Yiling Patriarch\u00a0 arrived, Cangse couldn't say she cared all that much. She\u2019d attended her mother\u2019s cousin\u2019s wedding earlier that year, and she had fallen asleep half way through. Lan wedding were boring, and she couldn\u2019t even sneak any alcohol away because there wasn\u2019t any.\nShe knew who Hanguang-Jun was, of course, even if she had only ever seen him once in passing; Lan Qiren\u2019s nephew, and Qingheng-Jun\u2019s son, and from the brief glimpse of him she had caught, he\u2019d looked every bit the fuddy-duddy that his father and uncle were.\n(Admittedly, a very, very good looking fuddy-duddy though).\nApparently Hanguang-Jun was now getting married. She had no idea who this Yiling Patriarch was, but her father had sounded annoyed about it, and her mother had said, \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s a lovely boy,\u201d in a voice that implied anything but, and Cangse decided that whoever he was, the Lans probably weren\u2019t a big fan of his.\nShe had a feeling that they\u2019d get along just fine.\nOn the day of the wedding, she was dressed up in her good dress robes, which really didn\u2019t look any different from her usual ones, and carried off in her mother\u2019s arms. That was the best thing about being a kid again; you could get carried literally everywhere, and hugs felt even more amazing.\n\u201cA-Yi looks upset, don\u2019t you think?\u201d her mother said, frowning slightly. Cangse wasn\u2019t upset, she was dreading another long, boring ceremony, but she was adult enough not to complain about it out loud.\n(Changze would roll his eyes, and tell her to give it another ten minutes).\n\u201cA-Yi, don\u2019t worry,\u201d her father said, laughing, \u201cI\u2019m sure the Yiling Patriarch doesn\u2019t really eat children.\u201d\nCangse stared.\n\u201cOh, enough of that,\u201d her mother huffed, hitting her father on the arm. \u201cIf Hanguang-Jun is marrying him, then I\u2019m sure he can\u2019t be as bad as they say.\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t he punch the Jin heir in the face?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re choosing to focus on? Not the fact that he wiped out most of the Wen Sect by himself?\u201d\nCangse choked on her own spit, and found herself hacking up her lungs a moment later. Her parents stared at her with wide-eyed concern.\nGods, just what had been happening in the world since she\u2019d died?\u00a0\n\u2026\nIt turned out that the wedding actually wasn\u2019t that boring, if only because it was very different from the last Lan wedding she\u2019d attended.\nFor one thing, the surrounding people were wearing a variety of different colours, clearly not just members of the Lan Sect. Of course; this Hanguang-Jun was Qingheng-Jun\u2019s son, and the current sect leader\u2019s brother. It wasn\u2019t surprising that there\u2019d be a huge turn out.\nThey weren't quiet either. There was a man dressed in Jiang Sect purple (Cangse felt her eyes linger there for a moment too long, and felt a pang of nostalgia) loudly arguing with the woman sitting next to him; a man dressed in the robes of the Jin Sect, trying to get a wailing baby to calm down, while the woman beside him looked on in amusement; a whole group of unfamiliar elderly men and women who were all talking a bit too loudly for the usual quiet of the Cloud Recesses. The whole group had garnered more than a few glares from the surrounding Lan Sect members.\nCangse would much rather be sitting over there.\n\u201cStop slouching,\u201d her mother whispered to her, just as the two grooms made their entrance.\u00a0\nCangse watched them with wide eyes. Hanguang-Jun looked even more magnificent than the last time she had seen him, and Cangse wondered if she would grow up to look half as good as that. If not, she was definitely going to launch a complaint. If she was going to be reborn as a man, she wanted to be a hot man.\nThe man beside him, the Yiling Patriarch, looked\u2026strangely familiar. Cangse couldn\u2019t put her finger on what it was. She had perhaps been staring at him for a bit too long, because her mother leaned over and murmured, \u201cRemember dear, he doesn\u2019t really eat children.\u201d\u00a0\nThe man beamed at Hanguang-Jun, and Cangse was struck by yet another wave of familiarity. Maybe she had seen him somewhere before.\nAt any rate, he certainly didn\u2019t look like he made a habit of eating children.\nShe bumped into Wen Yuan during the banquet after the ceremony. He wasn\u2019t the only child here, but Cangse had all but gotten herself exiled from every friendship group around here. Not only was she too loud for most of their tastes, but hanging out with a bunch of three year olds, when she was mentally old enough to be their mother, was just weird.\nSo all of the children were gathered together, sitting in a group together at one table, and looking almost creepily silent. That was another thing about these Lan children, they were all so quiet. Her Wei Ying had never been like this. Sure, they were adorable, but the first few times she had cooed over them like an adoring mother, the adults had started to look at her like she was possessed; and while she loved to stir up trouble, she also didn\u2019t want them to drag her to a mind healer.\nHer parents kept trying to urge her to go and join them, and Cangse tried her best to ignore them. At some point, they decided to ignore her and silently eat their meals in that typical Lan fashion that Cangse still hadn\u2019t gotten used to, and she found herself drifting away.\nThe room wasn\u2019t completely silent, which was a nice change from the usual mealtimes in the Cloud Recesses. The other sects were loud and boisterous, and Cangse wondered which one of them the Yiling Patriarch belonged to. She could see large amounts of Yunmeng Jiang purple amongst the sea of people, so maybe he was part of the Jiang Sect. She wondered if he was friend\u2019s with Fengmian\u2019s children.\nShe wondered if her son was here.\nWould she recognise Wei Ying, if he was here? Maybe she would, mother's instincts and all, but then, maybe not. She thought she was a decent mother, but that was more because of the effort she put in, and not because of any sort of magical motherly powers.\n(Yu Ziyuan had looked like she wanted to physically throw her out of the room that one time she\u2019d told her that she buried Wei Ying in the dirt, but then, the other woman always looked like she was a step away from physical assault, so maybe she shouldn\u2019t take it personally).\nShe was still watching the other sects when she bumped into a little boy, who looked around the same age as her current body.\u00a0\n\u201cThe children are sitting over there,\u201d she told him, pointing.\nThe boy didn\u2019t seem to hear her. He was watching a few Jin Sect disciples, who seemed to be eyeing the Yiling Patriarch and smirking, and scowled. \u201cIf they try anything to ruin Xian-gege\u2019s special day, I will kill them myself.\u201d\u00a0\nIt was such a strange thing for a child to say, that Cangse found herself staring at him.\nThe boy blinked. \u201cOh. You probably shouldn\u2019t tell anyone I said that.\u201d After a momentary pause, he added, \u201cUh, the children are sitting over there.\u201d\nThe thing was, if anyone else had heard this boy\u2019s strangely eloquent speech, and the death threats, they probably would have laughed it off as a strange quirk, or an impressive show of intelligence.\u00a0\nCangse, who herself was an adult reborn into the body of a child, had her doubts.\nAny other person might have been more cautious about this. They may have tried to get more information before they made their move. Cangse was just really sick of dealing with this herself, and really didn\u2019t see any consequences for getting this wrong. If the boy turned out to be a normal child that just so happened to be freakishly articulate, then she could easily deflect. And if he actually was like her\u2026\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d she asked him.\u00a0\n\u201cWen Yuan.\"\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd your other name?\u201d\nThe boy \u2014 Wen Yuan \u2014 blinked. \u201cMy courtesy name? I don\u2019t have one yet.\u201d\nShe smiled brightly. \u201cActually, I meant your name in your previous life.\u201d\u00a0\nA Nie disciple who had been passing by shot her a strange look. She waved cheerily in his direction.\n\u201cThe Lan Sect is so weird\u2026\u201d he muttered to himself.\n\u201cMy what?\u201d the boy said, a bit too quickly to be convincing. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d\nShe stared back at him, unimpressed.\u00a0\nHe was silent for a moment later, and then he huffed. \u201cYou too? Seriously?\u201d\nShe nodded.\u00a0\n\u201cHow did you know?\u201d\u00a0\nCangse raised an eyebrow. \u201cAre you kidding me? You\u2019re not even trying to hide it.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll have you know, I hid it from my family for years, and none of them suspected a thing.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWell, so have I,\u201d Cangse shot back. This was oddly entertaining. \u201cIt\u2019s really not so hard to hide from them. I almost wish it was harder. It would definitely be entertaining \u2014 this place is so boring.\u201d\nWen Yuan snorted. \u201cI grew up in the Burial Mounds, and I\u2019m being raised by my own son.\u201d\nCangse watched him for a moment, wondering if he was joking. Apparently not. \u201cThat\u2019s so cool,\u201d she breathed.\u00a0\n\u201cWei Changze.\u201d\nCangse felt herself grow cold. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cWei Changze. It\u2019s my other name.\u201d The boy \u2014 fucking Wei Changze \u2014 looked at her knowingly.\u00a0\nCangse let out a shriek and threw herself at him.\nWei Changze, her wonderful, amazing husband, who was now apparently also in the body of a toddler, gaped uselessly as she burrowed closer.\n\u201cAww, look at my A-Yuan! Making friends already!\u201d she heard the Yiling Patriarch cooing from a distance away.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Wei Changze hissed in her ear.\n\u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d she whispered back. \u201cChangze, it\u2019s me.\u201d\nHe huffed. \u201cYou haven\u2019t even told me your name yet, and you \u2014 wait.\u201d He stiffened, and her arms tightened around him. \u201cYou\u2019re not\u2026Cangse?\u201d His voice shook.\n\u201cMy name is Lan Jingyi here,\u201d she said.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he agreed, his voice frantic, \u201cand what about your other name?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cMy courtesy name? I don\u2019t have one yet.\u201d\nWei Changze pulled back and looked at her with wild eyes.\u00a0\nShe smiled. \u201cMy name, before all of this, was the most cursed name to ever be spoken in the Cloud Recesses. I think Lan Qiren still feels phantom pains in his goatee every time it\u2019s uttered.\u201d\nWei Changze\u2019s eyes misted over. \u201cSay it,\u201d he said, his voice shaking.\nShe leaned in close, whispered, \u201cCangse Sanren.\u201d\nHe whooped, wrapping his arms around her and spinning her around. People turned to stare at them, amused, bewildered, or cooing over the adorableness of it. She caught a brief glimpse of her mother and father looking horrified at their loud display. Cangse grinned and spun Wei Changze around when he\u2019d finally come to a stop, both of them laughing, until they fell to the ground with dizziness.\u00a0\nCangse was smiling more than she ever had since coming here. Wei Changze\u2019s expression matched hers.\n\u201cWe should talk,\u201d he said, ever the practical one in their relationship.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Cangse agreed, because talking about everything seemed like a very good idea. She was suddenly aware that for Wei Changze to be here, he would have needed to die first. She didn\u2019t want to think too hard about that; even the thought made her feel slightly sick.\nAnd Wei Ying. What had happened to Wei Ying?\n\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d she said, tugging at his hand. It was easy enough for the two of them to sneak out of the room, no one particularly bothered by two children running off to play.\n\u2026\nApparently what happened to Wei Ying was that he had married a very attractive, if slightly emotionless, accomplished cultivator, and she\u2019d watched the whole thing and had no fucking idea.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how,\u201d Wei Changze, the traitor, told her, sounding amused. \u201cHe looks just like you.\u201d\n\u201cShut up,\u201d she complained. \u201cHe\u2019s so grown up! How was I supposed to know that was the same little boy I used to bury in the dirt?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHe did the same thing to me, you know?\u201d\u00a0\nCangse blinked. \u201cWhat really?\u201d Ha, take that Yu Ziyuan! Her parenting methods were worthy enough to be mimicked after all, if only by her own son.\nAlso, she found it incredibly unfair that Wei Changze apparently got to be raised by Wei Ying. All that time that she had missed out on! If she\u2019d known, she would have dragged herself to the Burial Mounds long before, and damn anyone who had tried to stop her.\n(She tried not to focus on the whole her son was a demonic cultivator, and had tamed the Burial Mounds, and almost singlehandedly wiped out the Wen Sect, but also saved it\u2019s remaining members thing, because it still hurt her head to think about it too much).\u00a0\n\u201cWhat\u2019s he like?\u201d she asked. She thought about the man she had seen today, and remembered those silver eyes, and that familiar smile. Wei Changze was right (though she would never admit it aloud); she should have made the connection long before.\n\u201cHe\u2019s amazing,\u201d Wei Changze told her, smiling proudly.\u00a0\nCangse felt her heart melt. \u201cI want to meet him,\u201d she demanded. \u201cRight now! Or well \u2014 okay, maybe after the wedding. Tonight. No, not tonight, I\u2019ll let him enjoy his wedding night in peace. But definitely tomorrow.\u201d She nodded resolutely.\u00a0\nWei Changze nodded. \u201cTomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I get to interrogate my new son-in-law.\u201d\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Wei Changze agreed. \u201cAlthough, maybe you shouldn\u2019t call him your son-in-law to his face.\u201d\nCangse rolled her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I have more sense than that.\u201d\nWei Changze snorted, and Cangse glared at him playfully.\u00a0\n\u201cTell me more about yourself,\u201d he urged, shifting closer. \u201cTo think, Cangse Sanren, a true member of the Lan Sect.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t remind me,\u201d she said, shuddering. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you got to grow up in the Burial Mounds. I\u2019m so jealous.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Wei Changze agreed, smiling, \u201cbecause who wants warmth and security, when you can live in a cursed mass graveyard.\u201d\nCangse nodded solemnly. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she said, \u201cenough of your boring home \u2014 let\u2019s speak about the true source of horror and nightmares. The Cloud Recesses.\u201d\u00a0\nThey sat side by side for ages, trading stories, laughing, smiling at each other, and enjoying each other\u2019s company. They didn\u2019t kiss, because they were both in the bodies of toddlers right now, and that would just be weird. Cangse didn\u2019t mind too much, because after all this time not knowing what had happened to her husband, and finally having him back \u2014 albeit, a lot smaller \u2014 she was alright with putting off intimacy until they were both in less awkward bodies.\nThey held hands instead, and at one point, Cangse asked if he minded that she was in a male body this time around. She supposed that it might be strange for him, seeing his wife now looking like this.\nWei Changze smiled and shook his head. \u201cOf course I don\u2019t mind,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s still you.\u201d\u00a0\nShe hugged him again for that, feeling like her heart might burst out of her chest. She had missed him so much.\u00a0\n\u2026\nThe next day she smiled up at Wei Ying, taking in his familiar, handsome features in silent awe \u2014 Wei Changze was wrong, Wei Ying looked far more like him \u2014 and said, \u201cI\u2019m happy to meet you and my son-in-law!\u201d\nWei Ying blinked. Said future-son-in-law \u2014 apparently his name was Lan Wangji, which felt far less stuffy than calling him Hanguang-Jun all the time \u2014 simply stared at her for a long time. She guessed that was how he displayed confusion.\n\u201cHe means his father-in-law,\u201d Wei Changze interjected. Neither Wei Ying nor his husband looked any less confused. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get married one day.\u201d\nCangse bit back a snort of laughter, and nodded firmly.\nWei Ying\u2019s jaw dropped open. \u201cOh my God!\u201d he squealed. \u201cYou\u2019re both so cute! Lan Zhan, Lan Zhan, don\u2019t you think they\u2019re adorable!\u201d He latched onto Lan Wangji\u2019s arm, and started to yank it back and forth.\nLan Wangji, somehow still looking dignified despite the squealing man latched onto his arm, nodded. \u201cMn.\u201d\n\u201cLook at my little A-Yuan,\u201d Wei Ying sniffed, clasping his hands under his chin. \u201cNot even up to double digits yet, and already courting someone. You are definitely my son.\u201d\u00a0\nAnd that would never not be weird.\nIt was lucky that no one ever questioned when kids did weird, questionable things, and just brushed them off as children being children. They could go around telling everyone that they would be marrying, and no one blinked an eye.\n\u201cWe were going to go and see the rabbits,\u201d Wei Ying said, smiling. \u201cA-Yuan, why don\u2019t you ask your future husband to come with us?\u201d\u00a0\nCangse nodded eagerly. She would take any opportunity to spend more time with her son, who looked amazing, and perfect, and everything she had ever imagined him being.\nThat was how she found herself curled up in a small pile of fluffy bunnies, as Wei Ying laughed and piled them on top of her and Wei Changze, and Lan Wangji watched them with what she thought might have been the slightest hint of a smile on his face. Maybe. It was still pretty hard to read the man.\nShe sighed contentedly. A life in the Cloud Recesses really wouldn\u2019t be that bad, not if she had her husband and son by her side. This may not have been the life she once knew, but she had been given a second chance after her death, and she was going to make the most of it. \u00a0"
