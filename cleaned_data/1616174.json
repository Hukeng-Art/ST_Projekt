I've proven I'm completely incapable of writing a drabble or even a short story. This idea's hooked me and I keep getting sucked back to it.</p>\n<p>I really like the way last chapter ended, and if you did too you're totally free to leave off there and pretend that was the end.

    "text": "To save Beacon Hills, a witch demands \u201cthe most potent, powerful emotion in one of your souls. The one thing that makes you want to leap out of bed in the morning, the thing that brings a smile to your face when you think nobody\u2019s looking.\u00a0 Your raison d\u2019etre will be emptied and left void.\u201d\nBecause witches are dicks like that, and they feed off things like intent and emotion and energy.\nEveryone stalls, but they\u2019re in crisis.\u00a0 The town\u2019s in danger, and they\u2019re down to their last option.\u00a0 Stiles steps forward.\n\u201cTake it,\u201d he says, almost blandly. The werewolves amongst them can hear a fine tremor beneath the bravado. \u201cYou\u2019ll be doing me a favor. I\u2019m better off without it anyway.\u201d\n\"Stiles\u2026\" Scott starts, but it\u2019s done.\nHe seems no different afterward.\u00a0 He still loves his father fiercely, he hangs out with Scott in every free moment, he flirts shamelessly with Malia and worships the ground Lydia walks on (albeit with more irony and respect and less blind, childish longing these days, but that had happened long before the most recent crisis).\u00a0 He plays video games and reads comics and writes school papers on obscure topics to bother his teachers. \u00a0Every terrible price the group had feared and expected Stiles to pay seems unchanged.\nThey\u2019re confused and worried and finally straight out ask him \u2013 did he have any secret hobbies or dreams they\u2019d never known about? After all, it had seemed like he\u2019d known what the witch would take from him. \u00a0Stiles laughs easily and says that he used to put on a wig and be a secret rock star in his free time, and has given up the music life since the spell.\u00a0 But he doesn\u2019t give a straight answer.\nAnd finally, after days have passed with no major consequences looming, the group shrugs and moves on. Maybe the witch had lied; Stiles doesn\u2019t seem any different, and he doesn\u2019t seem upset about losing anything, so everything worked out in the end.\nAnd if Stiles spends less time hanging out at the loft and arranging impromptu pack meetings, well, senior year is a busy time for a teenager.\u00a0 And if he doesn\u2019t needle Derek as much in a crisis\u2026 if anything, that\u2019s a good sign, right? It means the pack\u2019s getting along, it means less frustration for everyone, means that things can be handled faster and more easily.\nAnd if Derek feels cold, like he\u2019s lost something intangible and irretrievable and invaluable, he would never be able to explain why.\nHe didn\u2019t pay a price; Stiles did. And Stiles is fine.\nIt comes out nearly three months later.\nThe group is relaxing together at the loft, eating takeout and enjoying a rare, low-key night in.\u00a0 All\u2019s well until Kira stumbles over a stray patch of nothing and spills her sesame chicken straight onto Derek\u2019s chest.\nIt\u2019s not exactly unexpected. How the girl can handle a sword with the grace of a samurai-ballerina but still can\u2019t cross a room without stumbling over her own feet has been a source of many a raised eyebrow and more than one joke about her having literally emerged from an anime. So Derek just rolls his eyes, shrugging off her repeated apologies, and heads for the stairs, stripping his shirt as he goes.\n\u201cIf I was still in love with him I\u2019d be having such a silent freak-out right now.\u201d\nDerek nearly trips over nothing.\nAs one, the group does a slow-turn toward Stiles, who\u2019s dropping his drink down onto the table and wincing.\n\u201cShit. I did not mean to say that.\u201d And he sends an embarrassed half-shrug Derek\u2019s way, and looks back down at his noodles like that ends the conversation.\nEyes flit from Stiles to Derek, who stands, body taut with tension, nerves fluttering between shock and\u00a0does he seriously\u00a0and doubt and\u00a0wait, what?\u00a0 Scott, maybe the most used to his friend\u2019s random proclamations, recovers first, laughing nervously.\n\u201cWait, dude. When did you have a crush on Derek?\u201d\nStiles pokes at his noodles for a few more seconds and then looks back up, shrugging.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a\u00a0crush, it was more like\u2026 Ok, I guess it really doesn\u2019t matter now anyway. It was more like this whole life-altering, all consuming love thing.\u201d And then he smirks.\u00a0Smirks.\u00a0Like his words aren\u2019t tearing rapidly fraying holes in the fabric of Derek\u2019s reality.\nHe shrugs at Derek again, like it\u2019s a small joke they can laugh about together.\n\u201cSorry, man. Awkward. But it\u2019s a total non-issue now. Like, beyond not even being an issue.\u201d\nDerek feels strangely exposed even though Stiles is the one talking, finds himself dragging the stained shirt back over his shoulders.\n\u201cHow\u00a0is it a non-issue?\u201d\nSomething like that, something \u2018all-consuming\u2026\u2019 He\u2019s a teenager; he\u2019s exaggerating.\u00a0 Or maybe the whole thing\u2019s a joke. That would explain how Stiles is so calm, so blas\u00e9 talking about it.\nIt\u2019s a hollow thought. He feels his cheeks going hot.\nLydia\u2019s mind is clearly going in a completely different direction, though. She breathes, sharp and startled: \u201cStiles, you didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d\nThe ironic smile flits from Derek to Lydia.\n\u201cYou guys knew I gave up something.\u201d\nIt\u2019s been nearly three months, and it doesn\u2019t take any of them more than a second to clue in. Kira\u2019s hand claps over her mouth. Scott makes a half-choked, whimpering sound.\nDerek\u2019s not sure what he does, but it makes Lydia\u2019s eyes go soft and pained when she shoots a glance his way.\nStiles glances between them, brows crawling high up his forehead.\n\u201cGuys, stop looking like someone died. It\u2019s cool, seriously. Feelings nixed, no crazy aftereffects. I\u2019m fine.\u201d\n\u201cYou gave up your\u00a0love?\u201d Kira breathes.\n\nLove.\n\nThe word hits Derek so hard he feels it rock inside him like a physical force. The thing that Stiles had given up three months back... he hadn\u2019t gotten to choose what it would be. He hadn\u2019t gotten to sort through his feelings and pick out the one that wasn\u2019t that important, that he wouldn\u2019t miss. The witch had demanded the most powerful emotion inside of him.\nThe most powerful emotion inside of him had been love. For Derek.\nAnd somehow, when Stiles turns his gaze back to Derek without a hint of hesitation or tension, when he grins and rolls his eyes, expression asking\u00a0really, what\u2019s wrong with these people?\u00a0it ends up being the last straw.\nDerek\u2019s in front of him in a second, grabbing his shirt and jerking him forward. Takeout noodles and chopsticks clatter across the floor. Scott makes another sharp sound but doesn\u2019t intervene and Stiles stares at him, face inches away, startled and plainly baffled\u2026 and nothing else.\nSomething\u2019s been missing for months, and he hasn\u2019t been able to pinpoint it.\nI\u2019m better off without it anyway, he\u2019d said.\nDerek resists the urge to shake the slighter man, to rattle that bland look right off of his face. His voice comes out ragged.\n\u201cWas caring for me really that horrible?\u201d\nThis is where the indignance would usually flash in those eyes, where he\u2019d pull away or jab his finger into Derek\u2019s chest, or lean in so close Derek could feel the warm puff of air as his breathing picked up, his heart pounding and his cheeks flushing but nothing about him smelling of prey.\nNow he just sighs.\n\u201cYou know what? Yeah, Derek. It was.\u201d\nThe hand drops off Stiles\u2019 chest. Derek takes a small step back, his heart grinding and clenching against the pressure of that casual indifference.\nStiles brushes a stray noodle from his shirt.\n\u201cI was a wreck, man. I mean,\u00a0I\u00a0was embarrassed for me. Every time you were in trouble or hurt, I\u2019d feel like the ground was being ripped out from under me. You left town for a couple months and I literally went crazy and let a demon fox crawl into my brain.\u201d He laughs. \u201cI\u2019d replay every stupid conversation we had for days afterward. I\u2019d pick out clothes wondering if you\u2019d like them, even if I didn\u2019t think I was seeing you that day. Like\u2026 seriously. Remember when you said my shirt looked decent that one time and my entire wardrobe suddenly turned flannel?\u201d\nHe\u2019s barely worn flannel in the past three months.\nHe continues, cool and toneless.\n\u201cAnd I\u2019d have these extended fantasies about you\u2026 and I\u2019m not just talking about the Not Safe For Work kind. I\u2019d think about just like\u2026 what it would feel like to hold your hand. How I could convince you to\u00a0let\u00a0me hold your hand. And\u2026 like, whether you\u2019d be a total Grumpy Wolf in the mornings, all scowling and squinting against the sunlight. But I always imagined you\u2019d be a morning person. You\u2019d wake up ridiculously early to work out and have these awesome omelets waiting for me when I finally dragged my ass out of bed. \u2018Cause I could so tell you love cooking. I mean your loft is practically empty but you\u2019ve got a spice rack, really?\u00a0 Or\u2026 Jesus, I\u2019d wonder whether you\u2019d want kids someday or whether the whole fire thing made you too scared to ever want a family.\u201d\nDerek flinches, and Stiles rubs his forehead. The rest of the group stands frozen around them, like they could fade away by just staying still long enough. Or maybe they feel like Derek: too numb, too shocked to think about moving.\nStiles looks like he\u2019s embarrassed again now, like that\u2019s the only feeling he\u2019s capable of having when it comes to Derek. Maybe it is.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I just\u2026\u201d He laughs again, and the sound cuts through the air like sharp claws. \u201cCan you even picture that? Do you have any idea what it feels like to be so totally gone on someone you know is\u00a0never\u00a0gonna feel the same way?\u201d\nHe shouldn\u2019t say anything. He\u00a0can\u2019t\u00a0say anything. But it was not saying anything that had brought this about in the first place. Derek\u2019s voice drags out, raw and broken.\n\u201c\u2026I do now.\u201d\n.-\nHe flees the loft. He doesn\u2019t care if it makes him a coward. He doesn\u2019t come back until he can hear that it\u2019s empty, and then he doesn\u2019t let anyone in for five days.\nEvery member of the pack comes by at least once. Lydia starts out sympathetic and quickly turns to threatening before storming off, clipping her $400 heels at a volume Derek\u2019s sure is designed to dig straight into his brain, a petty form of payback for locking her out. Kira leaves honest to god groceries outside his door, along with boxes of homemade cookies and containers of soup like he has the flu and isn\u2019t just dying inside. Malia proves that she grew up alone in the woods by broadly sympathizing and then waxing poetic about how Stiles is really such a great guy, Derek should try not to be mad at him.\nAnd Scott doesn\u2019t bother saying anything, just sits against the door and lets Derek sink down against the opposite side. They find respite in each other\u2019s heartbeats, silently commiserating over how oblivious they\u2019d been, about how much had been sacrificed without either of them noticing.\nThe pack\u2019s there for Derek, but he can\u2019t bring himself to face them. He\u2019d failed Stiles. He\u2019d failed himself. And, apparently, he\u2019d been so impossible to care for that Stiles had chosen to surrender his feelings instead of actually talking to Derek about them.\nHow the hell is he supposed to face anyone again after that?\n.-\n\u201cLet me in.\u00a0 Seriously, Derek, I\u2019ll camp outside this door. You know I will.\u201d\nThe door swings open just as Stiles is settling himself for a good long lean against it; he stumbles straight past Derek into the loft before catching himself. He doesn\u2019t have a second to savor the small victory though, because Derek\u2019s Glaring at him.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\u00a0There\u2019s no give in the tone, just bitterness.\nStiles had done that. He\u2019d put that there.\nHe sighs tiredly.\n\u201cThere are so many ways you could be going with that question, Derek.\u201d\n\u201cWhy would you wait out there? Why are you\u00a0here?\u201d Derek\u2019s words are stiff and indignant, his stance closed. Stiles rakes a hand through his hair.\n\u201cDon\u2019t turn it into that, ok? I still care.\u201d\nHis brows lift.\u00a0Do you?\nOf course he does.\n\u201cYou\u2019re still pack.\u201d\nHe\u2019d chosen those words carefully, thinking they would help, thinking they would make the distance between them easier. Pack is everything to Derek. It isn\u2019t until he says it out loud that he realizes how much like \u201clet\u2019s just be friends\u201d it sounds.\nDerek\u2019s brows come down in a hard scowl, and Stiles almost senses an echo of a feeling, a\u00a0memory\u00a0of a feeling. He remembers loving Derek\u2019s indignant faces, trying to force them with jokes or jibes. Having a mental catalogue of everything from \u201cI\u2019m trying to look grumpy to hide how much you amuse me\u201d to \u201con the verge of a murderous rampage; steer clear.\u201d Remembers marveling at the way those heavy brows would reveal every emotion with just an arch or a twitch. Derek\u2019s face had been a masterpiece to him once.\nAnd now\u2026 well, it\u2019s not like he\u2019s blind now. Derek\u2019s a handsome guy. But it\u2019s all so distant, so abstract.\nIt\u2019s such a bizarre feeling, to look at something that meant everything to you, and just\u00a0not care.\n\u201cI love cooking,\u201d Derek says abruptly, like he\u2019s been waiting five days to say it, and Stiles feels some of the tension go out of the air. He grins.\n\u201cKnew it.\u201d\nBut Derek\u2019s staring at the ground now, and Stiles isn\u2019t sure where to go from there. This should be easier for him \u2013 he\u2019s the one who\u2019s not invested. But somehow that just makes him feel wrong-footed. Robotic. How the hell can he have a proper heart to heart when his heart\u2019s just not in it?\n\u201c\u2026Why didn\u2019t you ever tell me?\u201d\nThat\u2019s better. Questions, he can deal with. Especially such obvious ones.\n\u201cCome on. You were\u00a0Derek. You were this beautiful, older, impossible fantasy for me, man. And you barely tolerated me, and you\u2019d had these girlfriends\u2026 I know, I\u2019m sorry, but you had. What were the chances of you ever being the slightest bit interested in this annoying teenage boy you barely even liked? I mean, I can handle the occasional gut-wrenching humiliation as well as anyone, but that? You rejecting me? That would have destroyed me.\u201d\nDerek\u2019s lips thin out, and he\u2019s looking at Stiles now with something like bitterness and something approaching self-loathing. Stiles rubs at his neck, feeling awkward.\n\u201cBut even knowing all that, I still wanted to be around you all the time. I couldn\u2019t seriously think about being with anyone else because you were always there.\u201d\n\u201cPast tense.\u201d\nStiles pauses, shaken out of his ramble.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cEvery time you talk about me it\u2019s in the past tense.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026 I guess you\u2019re kind of past tense to me, dude.\u201d And he winces at his own words, knows they come out cruel and callous and he doesn\u2019t mean them that way. Derek\u2019s face does that thing where it tries to close off but there\u2019s just too much emotion to hold in. His jaw goes stiff, his eyes bleeding hurt and loss. And betrayal.\nHe\u2019d had a mental catalogue for this too \u2013 the scale of Derek\u2019s stormy expressions from \u201cmake a casual joke and leave me alone for a while\u201d to \u201cI desperately need someone to hug me for six hours but I\u2019ll probably kill anyone who tries to.\u201d\nDerek\u2019s eyes haven\u2019t looked this vulnerable since Boyd.\nAnd Stiles\u00a0does\u00a0care, even if he doesn\u2019t\u00a0care.\u00a0Derek\u2019s still pack.\nSo he doesn\u2019t duck out, no matter how awkward he feels. He steps slowly forward and his hand goes up to brush Derek\u2019s cheek, an echo of a gesture he might\u2019ve one time meant.\n\u201cI remember being so in love with you.\u201d\nDerek\u2019s eyes are open wounds. He takes a shuddering breath and leans in slow, and Stiles lets himself be kissed. Lets soft lips brush against his, lets five-day stubble graze his cheek as Derek clutches his shirt and kisses harder, a desperate, longing whimper breaking in his throat. He squeezes his eyes shut and tries to remember that just three months ago this would\u2019ve been something so much more than mildly pleasant, that three months ago that sound would have\u00a0wrecked\u00a0him.\nHis eyes open slowly as Derek finally draws back, looking pale and choked and shaken, searching Stiles\u2019 face for something he can\u2019t provide.\n\u201cAnd where am I supposed to find a witch to take this from me?\u201d\nStiles draws a steady breath.\n\u201cEveryone was in danger, Derek. The whole town was in danger, even you. Do you want me to say I regret it? I\u00a0can\u2019t\u00a0regret it. I mean, I regret that it\u2019s obviously hurting you now, and part of me\u2019s sort of curious if we ever would\u2019ve made this crazy thing work but\u2026\u201d he trails off, shaking his head. \u201cSomeone needed to do it, and I did, and I\u2019m fine now.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re fine now,\u201d Derek echoes.\u00a0 It could have come out bitter or ironic, sarcastic or doubtful, but Stiles senses that he\u2019s actually taking solace in that knowledge.\n\u2026Damn.\nStiles made the deal and Derek\u2019s paying the price, and he\u2019s still worried about whether Stiles is ok.\nThey could have been so in love.\nIt\u2019s an abstract realization: numb, distant, intangible. And for the first time in nearly three months, Stiles wonders if he really is fine after all.\nHe drags himself out of bed, body aching that good, sweet ache that only comes in a sweaty afterglow. He arches his back just to feel more of that burn, and grins.\nSex is awesome.\nNow comes the less awesome part, because no matter how wrecked his partner gets during, Stiles has learned that he never has the decency to fall asleep afterward and allow a comfortable sneak out. Sure enough, once he drags his jeans on and turns, a pair of shifting green eyes are staring up at him, quietly expectant.\n\u2026Stiles really hates this part.\nThe part where he knows he should feel bad. The part where he drags his shirt over his shoulders, holds the other man\u2019s eyes and says pointedly:\n\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d\nThe familiar pain flashes through those eyes - even after all this time - before it smoothes out into something quieter. Acceptance.\u00a0Derek\u2019s lips tilt, a hint of a sad smile. His eyes slide closed and Stiles ducks out of the loft.\n.-\n\u201cIt\u2019s not right, you know. What you\u2019re doing.\u201d Scott\u2019s sitting in his kitchen when Stiles gets home, jaw set like he\u2019d geared up for this. Planned out his Alpha Wolf speech about right and wrong and morals that don\u2019t fit into a world where a person can lose control of himself if the moon hits him wrong, or find himself killing because the Japanese demon fox in his head tells him to, or wake up with one set of emotions one day and have them stripped away, the next.\nWho the hell\u2019s to say what\u2019s right or moral anymore?\n\u201cHe wants it,\u201d Stiles says, dropping his keys on the counter, feeling a small grin tug at his lips despite Scott\u2019s Disapproving Stare. \u201cHe wants me. It\u2019s not hurting anyone.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s hurting him because he wants it,\u201d Scott snaps back, frustrated and earnest. He\u2019s always earnest, Scott. That\u2019s why he never should\u2019ve known about this.\n.-\n\nIt doesn\u2019t start off slow, or subtle. They don\u2019t find themselves falling into it without noticing or drifting slowly closer or any of that romantic, gooey crap. Maybe in another lifetime they would\u2019ve; maybe in another lifetime Stiles would\u2019ve savored every second of a delicious slow-build. But in this lifetime Stiles doesn\u2019t have that emotion to spare for it.\n\n\nHe\u2019d sold his soul (love) to the devil (witch).\n\n\nAnd when a bloody, dull-eyed and decidedly shirtless Derek grabs his sleeve and asks Stiles to fuck him, it barely even occurs to him to say no.\n\n\nOk, it occurs to him, but it just doesn\u2019t seem like a good idea at the time. Because Derek\u2019s hot and lonely and needs it after this newest tragedy (Peter Hale was a dick but god, he hadn\u2019t deserved to go out like that, and Derek hadn\u2019t deserved to lose any more family, no matter how psychotic). And Stiles is a teenager and not exactly getting tons of other offers, and even without his lovey-dovey emotions intact it\u2019s an objective ego boost that Derek Hale thinks he\u2019s fuckable.\n\n\nIt\u2019s an even trade, really, for both of them.\n\n\nSo he licks his lips and presses a curious hand against Derek\u2019s\u00a0abs, and Derek lets out a breathless whimper that shoots through Stiles and then they\u2019re rolling into each other. The skin on skin feels so damn good and Derek\u2019s gone when he wakes up, and Stiles doesn\u2019t regret a second of it.\n\nAnd then it happens again. Or\u2026 almost. Both of them grinning and literally trembling with relief (well, Stiles is grinning. Derek\u2019s face is doing that thing where it\u2019s smooth and light like he doesn\u2019t have the weight of all the world\u2019s sins resting on his shoulders for just one second). Just generally grateful to be alive after this latest \u2018what the fuck, that actually exists?\u2019 monster that\u2019d decided to infest Beacon Hills. Stiles throws both fists over his head and turns to grin at Derek and suddenly Derek\u2019s against him, swallowing his victory shout and licking hard into his mouth. And there\u2019s adrenaline flooding his veins and he\u2019d been about a hand\u2019s breadth away from dying and Derek\u2019s this hard, solid wall of alive right against him.\n\nHe presses into it, dropping his arms to clutch those broad, sloping shoulders, and just as quickly Derek\u2019s pulling back, wide-eyed and spooked and flushing, breathing out stammered apologies like they hadn\u2019t already fucked less than three weeks ago so what the hell?\n\n\nHe vanishes just as Scott and Kira come jogging around a distant corner, both covered in yellow-grey monster goo and asking if the battle\u2019s won.\n\n\nDerek avoids Stiles for five days after that, and Stiles goes back to his life. Until Derek shows up at his door, tense and looking pensive.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says right away, shifting restlessly. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t keep\u2026 I know you don\u2019t\u2026\u201d\n\n\nStiles is good with talking but he\u2019s really bad with uncomfortable talking, so he grabs Derek and cuts him off by kissing him hard. Derek falls against him, warm and muscled and so pliant, a desperate groan dragging out of him. The sound twists something in Stiles and he pulls back, wincing.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t\u2026 look, I don\u2019t love you or anything, ok? I can\u2019t. But Derek, you\u2019re freaking hot and that one time was insane in a way I really wouldn\u2019t mind repeating. So I guess I\u2019m saying I wouldn\u2019t be opposed to a little stress relief or celebration now and then. If you want.\u201d\n\n\nThere\u2019s no way he\u2019s doing anything wrong or taking advantage or whatever, because he\u2019s just making a suggestion. He\u2019s giving Derek such an easy out.\n\n\nAnd Derek knows it when he hears it because he falls back, turns around and takes a few fast steps away, scrubbing a hand over his face. Stiles licks his lips and shrugs because, hell, it was worth a shot.\n\nBut then Derek\u2019s spinning back, breathing a ragged \u201cfuck\u201d and literally picking Stiles up, carrying him inside and slamming him against the nearest wall, kissing him deep and rutting him halfway to coming before either of them remember to shut the door.\n\nAnd after that it\u2019s a thing. An after battle thing, a break from research thing, a \"Friday night after the date with that hot girl from English bombs\" thing.\n\n\nAnd if Derek sometimes presses too-soft, lingering kisses into his skin or stops to trail his eyes down Stiles\u2019 face like he\u2019s in awe of it\u2026 well, he can\u2019t be blamed for having feelings any more than Stiles can be for not having them.\n\nSo Stiles ignores the way his gut writhes guiltily in those moments and grinds or bites a little harder, and then they\u2019re back to fucking \u2013 hard, hungry, desperate and meaningless\u2026 Except for that one instant after he\u2019s been licked, sucked and fucked to within a fraction of his life, when he\u2019s coming hard, toes curling, when everything in the world is just perfect and Derek, and he thinks he remembers what it might have felt like to be in love.\n\nIt\u2019s just physical, it only lasts about half a second into the afterglow, and after the heady rush is gone it\u2019s just Derek again. Hot and pack and there.\n\n\nAnd who\u2019s to say that isn\u2019t enough?\n\n.-\nScott grabs his arm as he turns to stalk away. He\u2019s not vaguely ready to have this conversation, but he doesn\u2019t exactly have a choice with Scott holding him in place like he\u2019s a pouting six year old. After he tugs once pointedly, ineffectually, he rolls his eyes and casts a cool look back at his friend.\n\u201cLook, can we really just\u2026 not?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Can you?\u201d\nStiles grimaces.\n\u201cDude, this is crossing all kinds of best friend lines. My sex life is so far beyond not being any of your business, ok? He knows what this is. He\u2019s the one that started it. He\u2019s a grownup and actually so am I, so just stop playing helicopter Alpha and let us make our own decisions, ok?\u201d\nScott grits his teeth but drops his hand off Stiles\u2019 arm, trusting him to stay and listen (and, damn it, Stiles does).\n\u201cI\u2019m not playing Alpha,\u201d Scott says, low and steady. \u201cI am your Alpha. And more importantly, I\u2019m Derek\u2019s. And you\u2019re killing him, man.\u201d\n.-\n\nThey\u2019re lying in bed afterward. It\u2019s their fifth time doing this, and their very first \u201cStiles is too buzzed to go home and see his dad but too sober to pass out anywhere, so let\u2019s go fuck Derek\u201d time together, and Stiles is realizing fast that he\u2019s a rambling drunk even after sex, and that Derek really needs to repaint the loft\u2019s ceilings.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the weirdest thing,\u201d he\u2019s saying, soft and thoughtful. \u201cI mean\u2026 nothing about you\u2019s changed. You\u2019re still unfairly hot, and you\u2019ve got this whole dry sarcasm thing that\u2019s like, my number one obsession in a person. And you\u2019re ridiculously loyal, and broody in this tall, dark, \u2018come and solve all my mysteries\u2019 kind of way. And every single one of those things gets me going like whoa. You know? But these days it\u2019s just\u2026\u201d He lifts a hand, splaying his fingers out wide in the air above them. \u201cpoof. Like the same equation suddenly yielding a different answer. You mean nothing to me.\u201d\n\n\nHe glances at Derek, sees him grimacing. And he feels a flash of embarrassment because\u2026 yeah, of course he\u2019s grimacing. That was a shitty thing to say.\n\n\n\u201cSorry, my brain to mouth filter sucks, and these days I can\u2019t really\u2014\u201c\n\n\nHe manages to cut himself off this time. He wants to say how weird it is that it\u2019s kind of impossible to think about Derek\u2019s feelings. They don\u2019t compute in his brain the same way they used to, the same way everyone else\u2019s does. Derek\u2019s thoughts and opinions have so little impact on him these days, it\u2019s hard to remember that the opposite\u2019s true for him.\n\n\nBut Derek\u2019s swallowing, pushing himself up slowly to stare off at a far wall, and Stiles can see the sincerity etched in the other man\u2019s profile.\n\n\n\u201cNo, you should\u2026 Stiles, keep saying things like that.\u00a0 It grounds me.\u201d\n\n\nStiles stares hazily up at him, nods. It stops Derek from falling into a fantasy, from thinking this is anything other than what it is. What it can\u2019t be.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t love you,\u201d Stiles says seriously, and Derek\u2019s lips twitch.\n\n\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\n\n.-\n\nFuck stupid teenage boys and their stupid, cheating \u201cwell, we never said we were exclusive, Stiles\u201d excuses. Tyler wanted \u201cnot exclusive\u201d? Stiles would show him not exclusive.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t love you,\u201d Stiles snaps, storming into the loft, tugging the door shut behind him and shoving Derek back against the refinished kitchen counter. Derek loses his grip on whatever spoon or spatula he\u2019d been holding. It clatters to the floor as he clutches hard into Stiles\u2019 hair, their bodies arching into each other.\n\n\nIt\u2019s been three weeks since their last time together, ever since Stiles had started seeing Tyler and had officially no longer needed a fuck buddy. Just three weeks, but Derek\u2019s curling into him and kissing him like he\u2019s been away at war or something and, god, it feels fucking good to be wanted.\n\n\nThat is, until Malia comes hop-skipping her way down the spiral stairs all \u201cDid I hear Stiles come\u2014\u201c and freezes, gaping.\n\n\nStiles shoves away fast, wiping at his lips.\n\n\nWell, his day had just gone from crap to worse.\n\n\n\u201cFuck, Derek. Mention there\u2019s company?\u201d\n\n\nDerek\u2019s cheeks are flushed, shoulders drawing in and eyes determinedly counting the floorboards. And, ok, maybe it\u2019s not totally fair to be mad at him since Stiles had sort of stormed in and jumped him without much chance for conversation. But still, Derek could\u2019ve just pushed him away or stopped him or something, couldn\u2019t he? Seriously.\n\n\nHis scowl falls away when his gaze lands on Malia. Cousins or not, she\u2019s everything Derek isn\u2019t \u2013 bright and innocent, and gets excited over the simplest things. She\u2019s got a tough edge under it all (no one could survive in the woods alone for ten years and not develop some kind of a tough edge) but she\u2019s still young in a lot of ways, still possesses this firm, naive sense of truth and honesty that could rival Scott\u2019s.\n\n\nWhich is how, despite his even request to keep things quiet, his best friend finds out about this less than an hour later.\n\n\nAnd won\u2019t ever stop giving him crap about it.\n\n.-\n\u201cLook, what the hell do you want, Scott?\u201d\n\u201cI want you to be Stiles.\u201d\nThat makes him freeze. Makes his lips purse, shoulders go taut.\n\u201c\u2026I am Stiles.\u201d Flickers of nerves, of familiar doubt flutter through him. Scott seems to see it, mentally backtracks, and grimaces.\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean it like... You\u2019re still Stiles. I know you\u2019re Stiles. You just\u2026 you\u2019re not yourself when it comes to Derek.\u201d\nScott\u2019s eyes are wide and soulful, begging Stiles to understand. And he does, that\u2019s the problem. His lips twist, sharp and caustic, because he can feel bitterness about the loss even if there isn\u2019t much else.\n\u201cBecause \u2018Stiles\u2019 is supposed to be in love with Derek.\u201d\nScott sighs in a way that makes him think he\u2019s missed the point after all.\n\u201cBecause you care about people. You get people. And now either you don\u2019t see what you\u2019re doing or you just don\u2019t care. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s weird to see you like this, man.\u201d\nIt hits him hard. His fist slams into the counter (and he immediately regrets it, wincing).\n\u201cIt\u2019s weird to be like this, ok? It\u2019s weird to know there\u2019s something missing inside me, that there\u2019s this\u2026 just\u2026 Derek-shaped piece missing from the puzzle of 'Stiles\u2019 heart'. And my god never repeat that \u2018cause it\u2019s about the corniest thing I\u2019ve ever said.\u201d\nScott\u2019s lips twitch. His eyes are still pained.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, dude. You\u2019ve said some pretty corny things about Lydia.\u201d\nStiles smirks back in kind.\n\u201cRight. The other great romantic failure of my life.\u201d\n\u201cStiles, think about it like this. If we were back in tenth grade and Lydia came up to you and said \u2018hey Stiles, I don\u2019t give a crap about you but let\u2019s mess around anyway\u2019 what would you have done?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Checked her basement for pods?\u201d But there\u2019s a sinking feeling in his chest. He knows exactly where Scott\u2019s going with this, and this time he\u2019s sure about it. \u201cAnd I would\u2019ve jumped at it anyway, taken anything she wanted to give me. Because I was totally ruled by her.\u201d\n\u201cAnd it would\u2019ve killed you, man. Just\u2026 if you can\u2019t think about Derek, think about that, ok?\u201d\n.-\nSo he tries to stay away. He seriously does. But if Derek\u2019s not a matter of love to him, he\u2019s definitely become an addiction. The way he\u2019ll drop anything the second Stiles gives him that look. The way he still acts tough and unaffected in front of people, but Stiles catches his eyes going to him too often, soft or hot and generally drinking Stiles in like he\u2019s the most attractive, interesting thing in existence.\nThe way he grips Stiles\u2019 wrists and pins them to the bed, holding him still and running thumbs down his palms in this ridiculously hot mixture of softness and domination. The way he always makes sure Stiles is taken care of without worrying about himself, remembering every kink and sweet spot like he\u2019s got a goddamn guide book for traversing Stiles\u2019 body, and he\u2019s a really eager tourist.\nStiles has been with four people at this point, including Derek, and no one else has come close to worshipping Stiles\u2019 body the way Derek does. He finds himself getting bored during dates, wishing he was back at the loft with Derek riding him.\nHe knows he\u2019s not in love. If he were in love he\u2019d have stopped by now. And isn\u2019t that some crazy, crappy irony\u2026 if he cared enough about Derek that he should be actually be doing this, he\u2019d be willing to stop doing this.\nAs it stands, it just feels too fucking good to let go of.\n.-\nKira\u2019s holding Derek\u2019s hands in a gentle grip, and Derek\u2019s letting her. She\u2019s kneeling in front of him where he sits perched at the edge of the low ottoman. Stiles can\u2019t see her face from this angle, but her head is tilted, stance soft and soothing. Derek\u2019s shoulders are slumped, his eyes down.\n\u201cYou know you should.\u201d\nDerek grimaces, twisting his head to stare out the side window.\n\u201cLook\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDerek, none of us can even imagine how it feels. If this had happened to Scott, if he just suddenly stopped\u2026 I know I\u2019d be a wreck. And it\u2019s ok to let yourself feel that, ok?\u201d\nDerek squeezes his eyes shut, lips thinning. The fact that he\u2019s not bolting says a lot about\u2026 Kira, maybe, or how much Derek\u2019s started trusting the group. Or maybe about how much Derek needs a little bit of comfort even if he\u2019s no good at admitting it.\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re all here for you, and we want to help you. But you have to try moving on.\u201d\nWhen Derek\u2019s eyes blink back open, they go past Kira and land right on Stiles, standing in the distant doorway.\n\u201cI know what I signed up for.\u201d\nStiles grits his teeth and ducks out of the house.\n.-\nIt\u2019s Lydia who finally grounds him. He\u2019d stormed to her house looking for some practical feedback, because Kira and Scott are too mushy and emotional, and Malia\u2019s mostly taken Scott\u2019s side on things ever since she declared him her Alpha.\nShe sits at her desk, running red (garnet, Stiles) polish over her nails and listening to him rant, even though she probably knows the whole story already because girls talk or whatever, right? Lydia had probably heard all this from Malia before Scott did.\nBut she lets him rant, and that feels good.\n\u201cSo I get that it\u2019s not ideal for anyone but it\u2019s better than having nothing, right? I mean, it\u2019s not like Derek\u2019s about to go make an OkCupid account and meet someone new, is he? So he could be alone all the time or he could be with me sometimes, and if he doesn\u2019t want it he could just fucking say so, ok? And he hasn\u2019t.\u201d\nWhich seems like pretty much the most obvious reason in the world why this is ok, no matter what embarrassing analogies Scott wants to make to Stiles\u2019 fifteen year old self.\nLydia spreads out her nails, eyeing them thoughtfully as they dry, and then shoots him an even look.\n\u201cYou\u2019re being a complete tool, you realize that?\u201d\nLast hope for an ally, dashed. He sighs tiredly.\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard it mentioned.\u201d\n\u201cHave you heard it mentioned that you\u2019re screwing with an abuse survivor?\u201d\nThat\u2019s new. He stops pacing.\n\u201cHe\u2026 Derek\u2019s\u2014\u201d\n\u201cA survivor. A repeated sexual abuse survivor.\u201d She flips up one gleaming garnet nail. \u201cKate seduced him when he was younger than us so she could kill his whole family. If that\u2019s not abuse, I don\u2019t know what is.\u201d A second goes up, perfectly painted to match her perfectly arched brow. \u201cMs. Blake slept with him under seriously false pretenses so she could get protection against the Alpha pack. And now here you are, screwing him when you know he\u2019s totally gone on you, when you know you\u2019ll never feel the same way because\u2026 what, it\u2019s an ego boost?\u201d\nA third finger goes up, and he falls back a step, feeling gutted. Because he\u2019s not, he doesn\u2019t\u2026\nLydia\u2019s eyes soften just a little, her hand lowering.\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying you\u2019re the same as them. No one thinks that. And don\u2019t get me wrong, there\u2019s no fault in looking for a good ego boost now and then. But take my advice, from someone who knows? Try to get it from someone you\u2019re not going to destroy doing it.\u201d\nHe nods, swallowing thickly because\u2026 he should\u2019ve thought of that. He would have thought of that, if it\u2019d been anyone but Derek. But Derek\u2019s this numb spot in his brain, and it\u2019s just getting worse as time goes on. As the echoes of his old feelings, his memories of what it felt like to love Derek, slowly fade with time and disuse.\n\u201cI wish I loved him, you know.\u201d\nShe sighs, shaking her head.\n\u201cI know, honey. But you don\u2019t. So are you gonna be the guy that dangles hope in front of him until you find someone better and ditch him for good, or are you gonna be the guy who does the right thing?\u201d\n.-\n\u201cNothing, nothing\u2026 damn it, nothing.\u201d\nIt\u2019s been two hours since the Incident at Lydia\u2019s, and Stiles is on his knees at the back of Deaton\u2019s clinic, tearing through tomes of lore in a way the vet-slash-supernatural hoodoo expert probably won\u2019t appreciate come morning.\nHe chucks away another book, but this one doesn\u2019t hit the ground with a familiar, satisfying smack. Derek\u2019s there suddenly, holding it and frowning at the cover. It's a new looking book with pretentiously old-fashioned font: Wytchcraft &amp; Wylle: Spells to Ward Against Spellcraft.\n\u201cNew enemy we should know about?\u201d\nDerek\u2019s here. Because of course Derek\u2019s here. He can probably smell Stiles\u2019 frustration from miles away or something.\nDerek falls to a crouch, expression going soft, dropping the book and running a thumb across Stiles\u2019 cheek.\nAnd Stiles stares at him, gulping unsteady breaths and wondering when he'd gotten frustrated enough to start crying. He flicks a searching gaze between Derek's eyes like he can find what he\u2019s lost inside of them. Derek seems confused but waits quietly, letting him look. Because Derek would never deny him anything... and it would never occur to Stiles to give anything back.\n\u201cI hate this,\u201d he snaps, and Derek flinches. His hand drops away, and Stiles watches it fall.\n\u201cStiles, I\u2019m sorry. I know I shouldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d\nDamn it, he thinks Stiles is talking about him.\n\u201cDon\u2019t apologize, Derek.\u201d And Derek flinches again, looking small and confused. Stiles did that to him. He still can't wrap his head around the fact that he does that to him with just an expression, a word. \u201cDerek, I\u2019m so not blaming you for anything. I don\u2019t hate you.\u201d\nDerek\u2019s lips twist, his jaw tight.\n\u201cI know. You don\u2019t feel anything for me.\u201d\nAnd there\u2019s definitely bitterness there, now that he's listening for it. The others were right, there\u2019s no way this is ok.\nDerek's looking more pained by the second. Finally, he tears his gaze away, staring down at the books instead. And his expression goes from wounded back to startled as he takes in the titles. Stiles follows his gaze.\nLove spells. Recapturing what was lost spells. Passion spells and reversal spells and\u2026\n\u201cStiles, what\u2026\u201d\nStiles rocks back on his heels.\n\u201cI hate this stupid void in my chest, Derek. The idea that this\u2026 that this could\u2019ve been everything. You could\u2019ve been the best thing in my life. But now it\u2019s just\u2026\u201d Poof.\u00a0He grits his teeth, raking a hand through his hair. \u201cI hate being selfish. I\u2019m not selfish, Derek, ok? I\u2019m just not. That\u2019s something I know about me. And I know that me from eight months ago would fucking pummel me for the way I\u2019m using you.\u201d\nDerek just shakes his head, looking at him like this was the farthest thing from what he\u2019d expected. Like he didn\u2019t even realize he was being used.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not\u2026 Stiles, I started this.\u201d\nStiles huffs a laugh, throwing his hands up.\n\u201cYeah, try telling anyone else that. It doesn\u2019t matter anyway,\u201d he adds fast as Derek\u2019s teeth bare, a fiercely protective look flashing over his face. \u201cThat\u2019s not even the point.\u201d\nDerek glances back at the books, brows furrowing like he\u2019s trying to make sense of what he\u2019s seeing. Trying not to get his hopes up.\n\u201cSo what is the point here? You\u2019re trying to\u2026 to reverse the witch\u2019s magic? Get your feelings back?\u201d His voice has gone small, taking on that thin, vulnerable sort of gruff it gets when he feels like something\u2019s too good to be true.\nIt usually is.\n\u201c...I wanted to feel what you feel, Derek. I mean\u2026 god, if what we do is this good when I don\u2019t feel a thing for you, I can\u2019t even imagine what it\u2019d be like if I did.\u201d Something flutters through Derek\u2019s eyes, like he\u2019s remembering just how good it is. To be with the person you love, however fleetingly. And Stiles finally feels a flash of something for Derek \u2013 jealousy.\n\u201cI mean, I\u2019ve ditched dates to be with you, Derek. I\u2019ve blown off hangouts with Scott to be with you. And every once in a while I think, well, isn\u2019t that what love is? Wanting to be with you all the time? Maybe the witch\u2019s spell wore off or\u2026 or I\u2019ve learned to love you again somehow. But I haven\u2019t, \u2018cause do you even hear me right now? I want to feel things, I want it to be better. I don\u2019t give a damn if you feel bad or if you hate me or if you\u2019re even having a good time, as long as you keep letting me near you, keep looking at me like you want me, keep doing those things to me.\u201d\nDerek\u2019s eyes are going soft and desperate again, and it\u2019s exactly the wrong reaction. Stiles feels his tongue dragging over his lips.\n\u201cAnd\u2026 you really shouldn\u2019t, Derek.\u201d\n\u201cOk.\u201d It comes out rough with emotion (emotion, damn it) and lust. And he\u2019s so not listening. He\u2019d let Stiles shove him down and fuck him on top of Deaton\u2019s library if he wanted. Stiles could hurt him, humiliate him, do anything to him and he\u2019d just take it.\nIt is so unbelievably unhealthy to have that kind of power over someone when they don\u2019t have it over you back.\nHe looks down to the books again, trying to make the rush in his ears fade.\nHe\u2019s not Kate Argent, he\u2019s not Jennifer Blake. He\u2019s still Stiles and Stiles wouldn\u2019t take advantage like that of anybody.\n\u201cAnyway, it\u2019s not happening. The spell, the payment, whatever? It seems pretty loophole-free. Half these pages were already earmarked when I got here; the others obviously researched the crap out of love magic when this whole thing first went down. You could turn me into some kind of mindless love slave or amp up my lust, but we both know lust isn\u2019t the problem. There\u2019s a spell to drag buried emotions to the surface, but the witch literally sucked them away and ate them or whatever; there\u2019s nothing to dredge up. We could try a mirroring emotion spell, but that would make me feel everything you\u2019re feeling ever, basically turn me into a less buff Derek-ganger with no feelings of my own, so I\u2019m thinking that\u2019s a no-go. There\u2019s\u2026 ha, get this, there\u2019s true love\u2019s kiss, but even if I believed in something like that I obviously don\u2019t love you anymore, and we\u2019ve kissed enough that it would\u2019ve worked if it was going to.\u201d\nDerek\u2019s staring at him in stunned silence. He clears his throat.\n\u201cSo we\u2019re where we were an hour ago.\u201d\nStiles licks his lips grimly.\n\u201cWe\u2019re where we were.\u201d\nDerek\u2019s eyes drag down his face, stopping at his mouth, going soft. A second later he\u2019s blinking, looking away, pushing himself back to his feet.\n\u201cThis is upsetting you.\u201d\nNo, it\u2019s upsetting you, idiot.\nBut a flash of memory-insight tells him that\u2019s not the way to convince Derek of anything. He presses his lips together, which Derek takes as a yes.\n\u201cOk. Ok, stopping won\u2019t be easy for me. I mean, I will, I just. I\u2019ll\u2026 I can leave if you want.\u201d\n\u201cLeave?\u201d Stiles glances around the cluttered room. He wouldn\u2019t mind some help cleaning up first, but\u2026\n\u201cLeave Beacon Hills,\u201d Derek clarifies, rubbing a hand down his neck. \u201cIt might be better. I probably should\u2019ve in the first\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDerek.\u201d That thought hadn\u2019t even occurred to Stiles. \u201cPlease don\u2019t pull that whole \u2018love something, let it go\u2019 thing with me, alright? We\u2019re both part of Scott\u2019s pack. Like, super-essential parts. You know the town would fall apart or blow up or something without us.\u201d And Derek needs the pack too so, ha. He\u2019d just kept Derek\u2019s best interests at heart, so take that, witchy feeling sucking magic. \u201cYou\u2019re not running off, ditching your family over this. And\u2026 that\u2019s not what I want, anyway.\u201d\nDerek\u2019s shoulders had done that fast, tense-untense thing at the word \u2018family.\u2019 Now he\u2019s staring at Stiles with familiar, wounded eyes.\n\u201cWhat do you want, Stiles?\u201d\n\nI want to stop the awkward talking and fuck you.\n\nBut he doesn\u2019t say that. That's growth, right?\nMaybe not enough, but it\u2019s something.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t keep living like this. If only \u2018cause I think Kira\u2019s gonna impale me at some point if I keep coming back to you.\u201d\nDerek looks away like he\u2019s embarrassed, like it\u2019s hard for him to accept that anyone cares enough to impale someone on his behalf.\nStiles had helped do that. Sure, a lot of it had already been there when they\u2019d met. There are a lot people to blame for the mess of insecurities that is Derek\u2026 but Stiles is one of them.\n\u201c\u2026I think maybe we should track down a witch.\u201d\nIt\u2019s stupid not to just tell everyone. It really is. Because if the witch suddenly shows up back in town looking for trouble or worse (better?) yet, if everything works out and suddenly he and Derek are bizarrely, ridiculously, sickeningly in love again, then what?\nEither way, the group\u2019s going to find out sooner or later so there\u2019s no reason to keep quiet about their plans. There\u2019s no reason for Stiles to panic and stuff his research books under his homework whenever Scott drops by his room. There\u2019s no reason to suddenly start flinching away from contact with Derek in public or avoid the group\u2019s questioning looks or stammer out excuses that there\u2019s no way Scott or Malia (or, who is he kidding, anyone) will buy for half a second anyway.\nBut for some reason, he does.\nFor some reason, he can\u2019t bring himself to admit to this. To wanting this.\nTo wanting to have his love back.\nEven inside his head, the words twist around and feel like something wrong. He gets shaky at the thought of it, the sight of Derek suddenly sparking feelings inside of him for the first time in over eight months. Now all at once Derek\u2019s face is frustration, is nervousness, is guilt (you\u2019re screwing with an abuse survivor), is anger (because he doesn\u2019t care, and it\u2019s not his fault he doesn\u2019t care. He shouldn\u2019t have to feel guilty for something that\u2019s not his fault).\nDerek's face is jealousy.\nBecause Stiles wants what Derek has. He wants to feel things he barely remembers feeling. He wants to want someone in a way that isn\u2019t casual and isn\u2019t just physical\u2026 And he\u2019s starting to seriously feel like he\u2019ll never be able to have it at all if he doesn\u2019t fix this. No matter who else he\u2019s gone out with, where else he\u2019s tried to focus his attention, everything\u2019s always come back to the same place. It\u2019s Derek or nothing.\nAnd the most ridiculous thing? He doesn\u2019t even fucking like Derek.\nHe doesn\u2019t, ok?\nHow can he? And how can he look forward to loving someone who means nothing to him?\nHe thinks maybe some of the anger starts coming out during sex, and he thinks that maybe Derek likes it that way because as much as they\u2019re flinching and avoiding each other in public, groping each other has suddenly become a nightly thing, sometimes a twice a day thing, definitely a whenever they\u2019re alone together thing, and once a \u201ccorner Derek in Scott\u2019s kitchen and manage to grapple each other as far as the backyard before giving each other furious handjobs and everyone else pretends not to notice when they come back in smelling like sex\u201d thing. They\u2019re rough with each other, on the verge of being brutal, and isn\u2019t it ironic that the minute Stiles announces that he wants to fall back in love with Derek, they decide to start acting like they hate each other.\nHate and can't keep their hands off of. That can be a thing, right?\nDerek can barely meet his eyes anymore; the few times Stiles has turned his head at the wrong instant and caught him staring, it\u2019s like Derek\u2019s eyes are bleeding desperation and maybe doubt or fear or something else that falls on Stiles like a heavy weight\u2026 until it\u2019s swiftly swept away, walled up, and replaced with a stony glare that\u2019s as close as Derek\u2019s able to get to blankness.\nThe love of Stiles\u2019 life, ladies and gentlemen. Sometimes he seriously finds himself questioning his pre-cursed self\u2019s taste level because\u2026 hot, broody, and emotionally stunted? Definite turn on, yeah. But falling in love material?\nThe group knows something\u2019s wrong. Knows it\u2019s something between him and Derek. But Stiles feigns ignorance when they question him, because what is he supposed to say? How can he say that he wants feelings he barely remembers having? How can he say that he wants to love Derek out of a selfish need to remember what loving is, at the same time that he wants to love Derek so he doesn\u2019t have to feel selfish for sleeping with him anymore? How can he say that he resents this friends, every one of them, for making him feel guilty about not feeling guilty, for making it impossible to just take what he wants and enjoy it?\nHe doesn\u2019t even know if he\u2019ll want Derek when this is all over, after all the time that\u2019s passed and everything that\u2019s happened. He doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019s romanticizing what he felt, if it just was a passing crush or if he\u2019s just at too different a place from where he was then for them to make sense anymore.\nAnd if he tells the group, they\u2019ll all expect a fairy tale.\nStiles has never believed in fairy tales, even back when he felt love. He doesn\u2019t see this thing with Derek ending happily ever after, and his doubts grow as the days go on. But he wants\u2026 he deserves the chance to choose for himself.\n\u2026And yeah, Derek deserves to know too. Closure if nothing else, right?\nStiles doesn\u2019t talk to Derek anymore, not really. It\u2019s handjobs and avoiding gazes and hard fucking when they have the privacy for it. And it\u2019s cleared throats and hastily passed research, and fast mumbles of \u201cthere\u2019s a rumor of someone matching her description over in Nevada, I\u2019m looking into it...\u201d and that\u2019s if they can\u2019t manage to avoid talking completely, sending most of their relevant information through texts or unobtrusively dropped notes on each others\u2019 desks while the other party\u2019s away.\nNot exactly the most romantic way to start his quest to get back his love, but that\u2019s why fairy tales are crap, right?\nThis is his life now.\n.-\nUntil he comes back from lacrosse practice one day (finally on first line for senior year, and he remembers when that would\u2019ve meant the world to him. But some feelings just fade naturally, he guesses, no magic witchy spells involved). Until he steps into his room and tosses his gear in a corner, and sees Derek at the edge of his bed, elbows on his knees, hands clasped, an open book at his side.\nHe\u2019s still not looking at Stiles \u2013 he never looks at Stiles when Stiles is looking at him, like he\u2019s scared of what he\u2019ll see or what he\u2019ll show \u2013 but his jaw isn\u2019t doing that tight-angry-defensive thing either. He looks\u2026 uncomfortable, maybe, or uneasy.\nStiles stops in the doorway. His dad\u2019s still at work, won\u2019t be back until well after dinner. He doesn\u2019t need to worry about pitching his voice low or pulling the door shut behind him before announcing, \u201cSomething tells me you\u2019re not here to give the rising athlete a well-earned blow job.\u201d\nSomething in Derek\u2019s eyes flutters \u2013 a little heat, a little tension. His jaw starts to clench.\nStiles just rolls his eyes, strips his shirt off and tosses it into a corner, digging a fresh one out of his drawer. He still stinks of sweat, but it\u2019s a little better now. He\u2019ll shower once Derek leaves. Or shower with Derek if their conversation ends up getting too awkward. Assuming they start having a conversation at some point.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s with the book? Find something useful?\u201d\n\u201cI found a way to stop feeling.\u201d\nStiles stops with the shirt over one arm, turns slowly and ends up dropping it to the ground beside the first instead.\n\u201cYou\u2026 what?\u201d\nDerek\u2019s eyes are shifting over the floor restlessly, hands rubbing against each other like he\u2019s trying to scrub some sort of stain out of them.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just as good a solution. Some might say better.\u201d He draws in a quick breath like he\u2019s gathering courage, and manages to drag his eyes to Stiles\u2019 for one searching second before he\u2019s looking down again. \u201cThis is only a mess right now because I care and you don\u2019t. If I don\u2019t care either everything will be fine. Balanced.\u201d\nHe feels his tongue drag out across his lips, a rush of heat flooding over him because\u2026 fuck, it would be, wouldn\u2019t it? They could screw when they wanted, not worry about it when they didn\u2019t, and neither of them would care. He could have everything he wants from Derek and lose everything he doesn\u2019t, and no one could say he was being selfish anymore because he wouldn\u2019t be hurting Derek by doing it.\nHe clears his throat.\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 not what we agreed to.\u201d\nAnd now Derek\u2019s looking at him, actually looking at him. Steady gaze and carefully closed off expression.\n\u201cIs it what you want?\u201d A beat, three, seven, while Stiles tries to work his way around his squirming not-feelings. The feelings he\u2019s pretty sure he should be feeling, a phantom-limb of giving a damn that sounds weirdly like Ewan McGregor telling him that love is a many splendored thing and he should be fighting for it, not salivating over the idea of Derek stripping his own feelings away too.\n(They\u2019ve been catching Malia up on important films at pack movie night, and Lydia does the lion\u2019s share of picking because apparently she knows \u201cwhat a teenage girl should and shouldn\u2019t have seen\u201d and also, apparently, pack movie night attendance is mandatory, which is the only reason why he\u2019s thinking about this. \u2026Stupid, tear-jerking musical Ewan McGregor\u2026)\n\u201cIt\u2019s not what we agreed to,\u201d he manages again. \u201cHow did you even find a spell for that?\u201d\nDerek presses his lips together, stares back down into his hands.\n\u201cYou\u2019re obviously not thrilled about... You haven\u2019t told anyone, and you\u2019re acting like\u2026 Look, if you don\u2019t want it, that\u2019s\u2026\u201d He chokes over the word fine. It\u2019s obviously not fine, thus the apathy spell. \u201cJust tell me, ok? Don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re obligated to do anything. Just tell me.\u201d\nStiles licks his lips, crosses the room slowly. Derek flinches a little when he starts to reach out, but he just goes for the book, squinting over the outdated English.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t anywhere near as refined as what the witch did. She took my love for you, specifically you. This looks more like it\u2019ll\u2026\u201d Stiles grimaces, \u201c\u2026numb your ability to love at all. Romantically, at least.\u201d\nDerek shrugs, head ducking further.\n\u201cLike I said. Might be better that way.\u201d\nAnd it really might. How much easier would Derek\u2019s life be if he didn\u2019t keep getting screwed over by the wrong people?\nHe finds himself turning away, walking toward his desk, bookmarking the page before sliding it shut. Derek\u2019s eyes are on him the whole time.\n\u201cI still want to fix things.\u201d\nSomething snaps. That something is Derek.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d He's pushing himself to his feet, his hands clenching at his sides, trembling. \u201cIf you don\u2019t care about me, if I don\u2019t mean anything to you, why would you want to\u2026\u201d His teeth grit. He looks like he wants to shove Stiles, or run.\nThe love of my life, he thinks again, sighing. He has such an easy out from this train wreck. Really, why is he trying to fight it?\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s not about you, Derek. Seriously, this is a hundred-and-fifty percent about me. I'm stuck in this whole screwed up \u2018you\u2019re hot and I should love you because I remember loving you and everyone\u2019s telling me I should love you\u2019 cycle and I just\u2026 I need to know what I\u00a0want. I need to be able to feel what I want, make that decision for myself. Do you get that?\u201d\nDerek stares at him way too long after that, long enough that Stiles rolls his eyes and turns to drag his backpack over to his desk, kick his dirty laundry into a slightly more sensible pile in his corner.\nDerek\u2019s voice floats over, a little thin, almost a full minute later.\n\u201cThe apathy spell\u2019s a backup then. In case we can\u2019t\u2026\u201d\nCan\u2019t find the witch, convince her to help. In case it\u2019s impossible to get the feeling back at all anyway. Hell, chances are looking pretty good that next month will see Stiles and Derek fucking each other senseless without a care in the world, shrugging past each other like strangers when they meet on the sidewalk.\n\u2026Would Derek even come to Stiles if he didn\u2019t love him? It\u2019s not exactly like Stiles looks the way Derek does. If there aren\u2019t feelings tying Derek to the awkward, often-flailing, squishy, human teenager that is Stiles, will he get any of Derek at all?\nSelfishly (everything\u2019s selfish when it comes to Derek) he finds himself suddenly hating the idea.\n\u201cSounds like a plan,\u201d he grits out. \u201cSo where do you stand on shower\u2014\u201d\nBut Derek\u2019s gone when he turns.\nA second later he\u2019s pulling the book back open, ripping out the apathy spell and shredding it.\n.-\n\u201cAre you serious, dude?\u201d\nHe tells Scott the next day. Derek\u2019s right; it\u2019s weird that he hasn\u2019t. It\u2019s also just as weird as he thought it would be to explain any of this out loud. Scott\u2019s staring at him like he\u2019s grown a new head.\nWhich is one of the few things none of them have actually seen at this point.\n\u201cI mean\u2026 you are serious, right? Because if you say something like that and you\u2019re not serious, it\u2019s gonna\u2014\u201d\n\u201cKill Derek, I know.\u201d He rolls his eyes. \u201cRemember back when you were my best friend?\u201d\n\u201cI am your best friend,\u201d Scott says, soft-eyed and serious. \u201cAnd part of that\u2019s looking after the things you care about, especially when you can\u2019t.\u201d\n.-\nResearch isn\u2019t going well. Their leads are turning up dry, even now that everyone in the pack is unobtrusively dropping research off on his desk or in his locker.\nDerek hasn\u2019t been around in days. Stiles stops by the Jungle, spends a night grinding up against sweaty, groping strangers, then goes home and jerks off to the memory of Derek\u2019s mouth on him.\nIf the damn witch can\u2019t give him his love back, maybe she can at least take away his lust, too.\n.-\n\u201cReally though,\u201d Stiles snaps, slamming his calc book shut and earning a hard look from the school librarian. \u201cI mean, this whole thing is supposed to be super important to Derek or whatever, right? You think he\u2019d be more\u2026 I don\u2019t know, invested in the research.\u201d\nIt\u2019s been four days since he\u2019s heard from Derek. Even the random notes appearing on his desk have stopped coming.\n\u201cDude,\u201d Scott rolls his eyes and casts a glance over to the girls at the other end of the table, who are all doing that thing where they\u2019re listening in without looking like they\u2019re listening. Except for Lydia, of course, who doesn\u2019t seem to care if the boys know she\u2019s eavesdropping. \u201cHe\u2019s wigging out. Obviously.\u201d\n\u201cObviously,\u201d Stiles echoes. \u201cIt\u2019d be nice if he could wig in a helpful way, though. I can like\u2026 feel his eyes itching on me sometimes but I can\u2019t ever spot him, you know? It\u2019s like we\u2019re back in the Early Days of Derek, when he was just this terrifying creeper lurking around the school and stalking you at lacrosse.\u201d\nScott grimaces at the reminder. He\u2019d been as weirded out by early Derek as Stiles had been. \u2026Maybe not quite as weirded out since Scott\u2019d had the Allison Distraction, and because he hadn\u2019t had to deal with increasingly Derek-centric wet dreams about being shoved into walls and pinned and scented\u2014\nLydia tilts her head, leaning across the table.\n\u201cAnd do you remember what he was going through back then?\u201d\n\u201cOk, so now we\u2019re comparing me getting my love back to his sister dying, and being hunted by a rogue Alpha.\u201d Stiles leans back, fingers drumming across the second book, the definitely-not-Calculus book (Locator Spells, Located Here) sitting in front of him. \u201cSometimes I wonder why the hell I\u2019m bothering.\u201d\nKira abandons all pretense of studying and looks up, pushing her hair back behind one ear, expression quietly serious.\n\u201cYou know it\u2019s not you caring about him he\u2019s scared of. He\u2019s trying to brace himself in case it\u2019s not possible. He's trying to close off now so it doesn't hurt as much later.\u201d\nStiles has the decency to feel a little bit bad about shredding the apathy spell.\n.-\nStiles tracks Derek down at the loft after school. He drops his bag and closes in fast, ignoring the way Derek's jaw goes tight and his shoulders tense up at the sight of him. He grabs Derek\u2019s belt and has his pants half undone by the time the other man gets enough control back to growl out a warning \u201cStiles\u2026\u201d\n\u201cFuck you, Derek. I\u2019m not letting you check out on this now. We alone?\u201d\nDerek nods, looking cornered. Hunted.\n\nGood.\n\nStiles\u2019 hand slips into Derek's jeans, palms him roughly. His eyes flutter.\n\u201cStiles,\u201d he starts again, tense and nervous like they\u2019ve never done this before. Like they haven\u2019t been doing this constantly. But he doesn\u2019t fight the motion as Stiles backs him up against a wall - he\u2019s gonna need a wall when Stiles is done with him \u2013 and kneels down deliberately in front of him.\n\u201cWhat are you\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid, Derek. You\u2019ve done this for me enough times.\u201d\nHe\u2019s never bothered being on the giving end of this with Derek before, though. It\u2019s honestly never occurred to him. BJs are more about pleasuring the other person, about getting off by getting them off. That\u2019s never exactly been a priority for Stiles.\nAnd nothing\u2019s changed, not really. Except now he\u2019s gone a few days without Derek, now he knows what it might feel like for Derek not to want him. Ever since this started it\u2019s just been a given that he does. That he will, no matter what.\nAnd he wants Derek to want him. Wants him to be raw with it, scrambling. Helpless to say no.\nHe wants to be wanted.\nIt\u2019s not love. It\u2019s definitely not healthy.\nAnd when Derek comes gasping, knees buckling, leaning back against the wall like he can barely stay upright, when he blinks hazy eyes and stares at Stiles like he never wants to look away, when he grips the front of his shirt and whines against his lips and breathes \"yes\" to Stiles' throaty \"mine\"...\n\u2026He realizes he\u2019s starting to scare himself.\n.-\nA figure steps out of a stray patch of shadow. Stiles was on the way out from the Sheriff\u2019s station after bringing his dad dinner, making his way up the street to where he\u2019d parked his Jeep. It's an average night; a strangely average night, honestly. He should\u2019ve expected something like this to happen.\nHe doesn't get \"average\" that often in his life.\nSo when the figure shifts out into the light of the street lamp Stiles stops short, stares for way too long, and then bursts out laughing.\n\u201cYou know what? Honestly, I\u2019m not even surprised.\u201d\nPeter Hale smiles.\nHe\u2019s standing casually, hands clasped behind his back, his hair longer than it was the last time Stiles saw him. That time when he\u2019d died, been immolated for the third time, this time by blinding-white fae-fire that burned so hot there\u2019d been nothing left for Malia and Derek to bury.\nThat really should\u2019ve been their first clue, huh? Never trust anything when it comes to Peter.\nStiles shakes his head.\n\u201cSo what was your grand plan this time, huh?\u201d\n\u201cNo grand plan,\u201d he answers, voice light and hushed and far too pleased with himself. His teeth gleam white and a touch too sharp as he grins. \u201cI just needed to get away. Realized the whole fathering thing wasn\u2019t really for me after all.\u201d\nStiles snorts. Like anyone ever couldn\u2019t have told him he wasn't dad material. Still.\n\u201cYou\u2019re an incredible bastard, you know that? After all the effort you put into finding her?\u201d\nHe shrugs, pacing a step toward Stiles, coming up alongside his Jeep.\n\u201cWell, try anything once.\u201d\nIt\u2019s so pointedly nonchalant that Stiles finds his hands clenching, finds himself digging around for something else to try and pull\u00a0a reaction from him.\n\u201cDo you have any idea what you did to Derek?\u201d\nAnd the frustration in his tone doesn't even need to be forced, because that\u2019s when this whole mess really started. Sure, the price had been paid before that, and Derek and the others had learned what Stiles had given up by then, but it wasn\u2019t until Peter\u2019s death that Derek had been vulnerable enough to act on it.\nPeter\u2019s eyes are dancing in the darkness.\n\u201cOh, it seemed like you were handling my nephew well enough in my absence.\u201d\nStiles mimes a gag.\n\u201cThat sounded unbelievably creepy, you know that?\u201d\nEverything the bastard says sounds creepy. Or syrupy-sweet and mocking, which is what he switches over to now.\n\u201cAnd is that caring I hear for dear Derek? Have you been cured of the witch\u2019s evil curse in my absence? Are you both free to resume your nauseating saga of will they, won\u2019t they and stolen glances?\u201d\nIt makes him grimace.\n\u201c\u2026Not yet.\u201d\nPeter\u2019s brow quirks.\n\u201cYet? But you want to.\u201d\nAnd is this seriously even happening right now?\n\u201cDid you really come back from the dead to chat about my love life? Shouldn\u2019t we be talking about, I don\u2019t know, how you\u2019re alive or something?\u201d\n\u201cI was owed a favor,\u201d he says like it\u2019s nothing. And Stiles is pretty sure he\u2019s never planning on giving anything clearer than that. \"But now I come back to town and find that you\u2019re thinking about changing your situation. Even though you have the easiest out imaginable, with a heroic sacrifice backing you and everything. No one can possibly blame you, and you can go on living your life without the heartache and misery sure to come from loving a Hale.\u201d\nStiles stares at him for a long second, then twists his body, looking left and right like he\u2019s trying to see something just out of view. Peter frowns.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n\u201cOh, just trying to find the angel on my other shoulder. Pretty sure you guys are supposed to come in pairs.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve considered this already.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, am I an idiot? Don\u2019t answer that. Of course I\u2019ve considered it. And it seems like an awesome idea like five-sixths of the time.\u201d\n\u201cAnd yet you\u2019re still hunting the witch.\u201d\nHe remembers the sick satisfaction of feeling Derek cling to him, sweaty and dazed and desperate for more. Of knowing he could drop him at any second and feel nothing more than the discomfort of an itch not being scratched.\nHe remembers feeling like Kate fucking Argent.\n(And Stiles isn\u2019t like that. Except, apparently, some part of him is.)\n\u201cThat one-sixth is a pretty persistent bitch to shake.\u201d\nPeter watches him silently, and Stiles had forgotten that narrow-eyed, searching look was a Hale family trait. He shifts under it, starts to scowl until\u2026\n\u201cWell, alright, then.\u201d\nAnd Peter crosses the last step over to Stiles\u2019 Jeep, pulls the door open (it\u2019d been locked, damn werewolves), and drags a woman out by the nape.\nHer hands are bound, her mouth gagged. She\u2019s unconscious.\nThey\u2019re twenty yards from the freaking police station and Peter\u2019s brought a hostage and stuck it in Stiles\u2019 Jeep.\nAbout two seconds later, after that shock wears off, Stiles realizes what he probably should\u2019ve noticed in the first place: the hostage is the witch.\nShe\u2019s younger than his memory made her out to be: no hideous warts, crow\u2019s feet or cackling (though that last bit might have been because of the gag. Or, you know, the fact that she's unconscious).\nStiles stares until Peter, smiling, shoves her back into the car. When he looks up, he\u2019s feeling shaky.\n\u201cThat was a test?\u201d\n\u201cAnd you performed admirably. Consider this an early wedding present for you and my dear nephew.\u201d\nThe mocking tone\u2019s enough to keep Stiles from flinching at the words.\u00a0Peter doesn\u2019t believe in fairy tales either.\nBut he still thinks it's worth it to break the spell.\n\u201cBut how did you\u2026\u201d\n\u201cFind her? Simple. Well\u2026 no. Let\u2019s not downplay my heroics. It was nearly impossible. It turns out witches aren\u2019t exactly fans of being hunted any more than the rest of us are. I narrowly avoided being turned into a spotted toad several times, I\u2019m sure.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nHe shrugs, lips tugging while Stiles gapes.\n\u201cMy nephew\u2019s always been led by his emotions. It\u2019s a tiresome trait and, honestly, you\u2019d think he\u2019d have learned better by now. But he\u2019s got his sights set on you, and I knew he\u2019d become more insufferable than usual until you two cemented your sappy love story, so\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou care.\u201d Stiles stares for a second, then barks out a laugh. \u201cHa, I knew you cared. All you Hales are way mushier than you let on, you know that?\u201d\nPeter\u2019s eyes roll.\n\u201cI owed him a happy ending or two. Let\u2019s say my debt\u2019s paid.\u201d\nHe shoves the car door shut, falls back a step. Like he\u2019s just planning on walking away now that his delivery\u2019s been made.\n\u201cWait,\u201d Stiles follows him forward. \u201cSo are you back now?\u201d\n\u201cI think not. This town is a tether I need to break free of. And once you\u2019re cured I\u2019m sure it will become even more unbearable than before.\u201d\nStiles snorts.\n\u201cAw, you think I\u2019m bearable.\u201d\n\u201cDecidedly more so than when you end up with hearts in your eyes and start changing all your passwords to \u2018Derek\u2019.\u201d\nHis grin falls away, gut twisting nervously. That\u2019s not going to happen, is it? He\u2019s still going to be him. He\u2019d been in love with Derek before and he hadn\u2019t gone all Scott 2.0 about it.\nPeter turns, and Stiles steps forward again.\n\u201cIf you wanted to leave town to look for the witch, why not just go? Why the elaborate death scene?\u201d\nHis head turns, Stiles catches the silhouette of a smirk.\n\u201cTwo birds with one stone, Stiles. Always aim for two birds.\u201d\u00a0He stops walking, waits while Stiles thinks. While he licks dry lips, nods slowly.\n\u201cSo I guess you want this to stay our little secret, then. You don\u2019t want me telling the others you\u2019re alive.\u201d\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t exactly free if your tethers come looking for you.\u201d\nHe nods again. Hears himself say, faint and hesitant: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to break free, you know. You could have a place here.\u201d\nPeter only laughs.\n\u201cTouching, Stiles. Save some of that passion for my nephew, alright? And... be careful. You might find that caring's as much of a curse as what you have now.\u201d\nHis hand lifts, he sinks back into the nearest shadow, and just like that he\u2019s gone.\u00a0Stiles stares at the empty street for nearly a full minute, then turns to look at the bound, unconscious witch.\n\u201cDid that seriously just happen?\u201d\n\nAn echo.\n\n\nA moment.\n\n\nA goodbye.\n\n\nStiles draws a quiet breath \u2013 fear and eagerness and yeah, why the hell not? \u2013 and nods.\n\n\n\u201cDo it.\u201d\n\n.-\nIt\u2019s not that Derek doesn\u2019t want to believe it. And it\u2019s not even that he doesn\u2019t believe it. It\u2019s just that\u2026 how the hell is he supposed to believe that, after all this time, something\u2019s finally going right?\nHis phone starts to go dark and he thumbs the screen again, staring down at the message like it\u2019ll change if he looks away, turn into something different, suddenly mean something else.\nI have her. Bringing her to the loft.\nIt\u2019s short. Vague. It could mean anything\u2026 except that it doesn\u2019t. After weeks of fruitless searching suddenly, impossibly, Stiles just has her.\nIt could be a joke. Stiles knows better than to do something like that, but what Stiles knows better than to do and what Stiles actually does don\u2019t always go together. Especially these days. Especially concerning Derek.\nIt\u2019s a joke. It\u2019s easier to prepare for a joke \u2013 for Stiles being unintentionally cruel \u2013 than to let himself hope for the improbable.\nDerek\u2019s hands clench the battered surface of the table as the rest of the group starts to filter in: Scott catching his eyes and nodding with a shaky sort of smile that would echo Derek\u2019s feelings perfectly if he wasn\u2019t forcing himself to think joke joke it\u2019s just a joke; Lydia and Malia coming in together, expectant and excited respectively. When Kira gets there she barrels across the room and wraps Derek in a firm hug before pulling back shyly, murmuring, \u201cWe\u2019re here for you, you know, whatever\u2026\u201d\nSomehow, that\u2019s what makes it real. Stiles might be cruel to Derek, but he wouldn\u2019t do this to the rest of them.\nThere\u2019s a lump in his throat and he suddenly can\u2019t meet anyone\u2019s eyes. He falls back from the table, from the phone and the text he\u2019s been compulsively refreshing for the past twenty minutes, retreating to sit on the stairs, hands clasped.\nThey settle into an uncomfortable silence, and wait for Stiles and the witch.\n.-\nDespite his assurances to Peter, Stiles finds himself circling the streets aimlessly for about half an hour before he finally pulls to a stop outside Derek\u2019s loft (and even now, it\u2019s more because the witch has started twitching in the backseat than because he\u2019s really come to terms with anything).\nWhich is weird, because he thought his mind was pretty much made up already.\nHe doesn\u2019t get out of the car. Doesn\u2019t move, doesn\u2019t so much as take his hands off the wheel until Scott comes out and asks why he\u2019s not coming up.\nHe feigns a smile he doesn\u2019t feel, nodding toward the backseat, and says he\u2019s been waiting for some big, strong werewolf to come and carry her up for him.\nScott smiles back and, for a second, Stiles thinks he\u2019s going to get away with it. But then Scott\u2019s clasping his shoulder and saying \u201cIt\u2019ll be ok, man. Whatever happens, we\u2019ll deal with it. \u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he grins back, too brightly. \u201cI\u2019m cool. Getting my feelings back, right? Rebooting to Stiles 1.0. What\u2019s there to be nervous about?\u201d\n.-\nApparently, nothing.\nBecause that\u2019s what\u2019s happening.\nIt had been such a battle to get this far, Stiles hadn\u2019t given too much thought to it just not happening.\nThe witch is still bound, no longer gagged, sitting in a flat-backed chair and staring around the pack more like she\u2019s confused by her predicament than anything.\n\u201cThe price was agreed upon,\u201d she says slowly, like they\u2019re school children (which, ok, most of them are. But like, little ones. The kind who need to walk in two straight lines down the halls and don\u2019t grasp that just because something smells good, doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you should eat it). \u201cAnd it has been paid.\u201d\nShe\u2019s definitely not as malicious as Stiles\u2019 memories made her out to be\u2026 which makes sense, really, since she\u2019d been the one who helped them save the town all that time ago and all. Still, she\u2019s spent the better half of the past year just being \u201cthat b\u2026 uh, witch\u00a0who messed with Stiles\u2019 heart\u201d so he guesses it\u2019s understandable that they ended up in this place.\nThe \u201ccrossed arms and glaring and tying her up and generally treating her like a prisoner,\u201d place.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles says, because he has to be the one to say it, \u201cand now we\u2019re asking for a refund. Sorry, size doesn\u2019t fit, color doesn\u2019t match my eyes, and I\u2019m not taking store credit so don\u2019t even try.\u201d It\u2019s screwing with my brain and turning me into someone that freaking scares me goes unsaid, but might filter through in the tension in his tone.\nShe frowns slightly, actually seems sympathetic, as her gaze floats around the room to finally land on Derek. He\u2019s still perched over on the stairs, where he\u2019s been all evening, hands clenching, jaw tight as he frowns down at his knees determinedly. The only time he moved since Stiles walked in was to get up, grab some duct tape and shove it in Scott\u2019s hands before returning to his perch. He hasn\u2019t met anyone\u2019s eyes once, and it\u2019s starting to drive Stiles crazy.\n\u201cIt was for that one, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Finally Derek\u2019s eyes flick up. He looks like he\u2019s physically clamping down on a snarl. She only smiles faintly, distantly, watching him with unfocused eyes like she\u2019s seeing something other than his face. \u201cI see. You didn\u2019t realize it was returned.\u201d Then she\u2019s looking back to Stiles, a brow arching. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see why this affects our bargain. I do clean work; I plucked your emotions out by the roots. His feelings should have no bearing on your own. So break ties and move on. The price has been paid.\u201d\n.-\nDerek can\u2019t stand the weight of all the eyes sliding to him. The pity, the bland nonchalance. He\u2019s not sure which is worse.\nHe leans down further, squeezing his eyes shut, holding himself back from running. He needs to keep it together.\nUltimately, they\u2019re all gathered here for him. Whatever Stiles says he wants, the witch is right: he can\u2019t care either way. If this doesn\u2019t work, he\u2019ll be able to shrug and move on. The rest of the group is only invested in this because Derek\u2019s making it a problem. The witch has been brought back and Stiles is questioning his sacrifice all because of how Derek feels, because he can\u2019t control himself, can't stop from responding when Stiles comes to him.\nHe\u2019s been making a mess of things for months, now.\n\u201cThen unpay it,\u201d Scott\u2019s saying, stepping forward. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t fair to ask that from him in the first place.\u201d\n\u201cBut he agreed regardless,\u201d the witch\u2019s voice is smooth and toneless. Derek wonders if the tape on her wrists is trapping her at all; she certainly doesn\u2019t sound like someone being detained against her will. The thought forces him to look back up, and he finds her watching him evenly. \u201cThis is the way things are now. You should accept it. You\u2019re only hurting yourselves by attempting otherwise.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re pack,\u201d Stiles cuts in coolly. If his voice were a little higher he would sound just like the witch. \u201cThere\u2019s no \u2018moving on\u2019 here. We\u2019ve got to deal with this somehow, and you\u2019re going to help us.\u201d\n\u201cSo you wish to rescind our previous bargain? Sacrifice the town?\u201d\nThat stalls everyone.\nStiles backs up a step, glancing at Scott. Derek finds himself rising, his gaze caught on the witch.\n\u201cSo those are our options? We take back Stiles\u2019 feelings and you\u2019ll destroy the town out of spite?\u201d\nThere\u2019s nothing malicious in her returning look; she hasn\u2019t been malicious once tonight, even after waking up tied to a chair.\n\u201cBy taking the boy\u2019s feelings, you would be destroying the town. Ripping away the anchor keeping the spell of protection in place. Why did you think I requested the sacrifice in the first place?\u201d\n.-\n\nThe town is literally shredding out of existence around them.\n\n\nA coven of witches wishing to harness the power of the Nematon dug too deeply and can\u2019t handle what they unleashed. Beacon Hills is thick with an aura that even the average human can feel, of doom and destruction, getting worse by the hour. People left and right are falling into fits of despair.\n\n\nBeacon Hills has seen more suicides in the past three days than it has in the decade before it and, if their research is right, that\u2019s only the first stage. People subconsciously recognizing the horror that\u2019s to come.\n\n\nLydia hasn\u2019t stopped screaming in hours, Scott hasn\u2019t slept since the first wave of despair hit, and Derek\u2019s eyes are hollow and vacant in a way Stiles hasn\u2019t seen since he cleaned Boyd\u2019s blood from his limp hands.\n\n\nSo when the witch from a rival coven arrives, agreeing to solve the problem as long as one of the group is willing to sacrifice something as petty as an emotion, Stiles barely hesitates before moving forward.\n\n\nWhat the hell does it matter anyway, right? His stupid, hopeless crush... it\u2019s been doing more harm than good. Making him awkward when he doesn\u2019t need to be, stopping him from looking places where he might actually have a chance.\n\n\nHim and Derek, fucking hopeless.\n\n\nHe smiles blandly.\n\n\n\u201cTake it.\u201d\n\n.-\n\u201cSo there\u2019s no way.\u201d Derek finds himself speaking first, while the rest of the group gape in varying states of shock at the witch. He\u2019s been prepared for this, prepared for it not to work since Stiles first suggested it, since he found himself digging through Deaton\u2019s books for an apathy spell instead of looking up summoning rituals. \u201cThe emotion wasn\u2019t just your price; it was a component in the spell.\u201d\nStiles seems more shaken than Derek would have thought. He stumbles another step, eyes on the floor, his next breath coming in sharply. Scott catches his arm.\n\u201cGreat magic requires a great sacrifice. The boy\u2019s love is holding closed the tear caused by the Nematon. To return it to him would\u2014\u201d\n\u201cPut us right back where we were eight months ago.\u201d Derek doesn\u2019t have to look to Scott, Alpha or no, before shaking his head.\nThe witch seems to be going for sympathy as her brows crease. It reminds Derek painfully of Stiles\u2019 expressions in those rare moments when he looks at Derek and tries to remember a feeling.\n\u201cIt was a powerful emotion, young wolf. You should feel proud to have inspired it.\u201d\nHis eyes drag to the right and Stiles is already watching him, expression raw with frustration, with disappointment, with want and for a second Derek can almost convince himself it\u2019s for him. But it\u2019s a secondhand feeling. Stiles wants to want, wants to feel this thing the witch is describing, this emotion clawing bloody streaks in Derek\u2019s chest.\nHe blinks his eyes closed and keeps them that way, squeezing until he can hear the pressure in his ears, until the dampness in his lashes could just be from the strain.\nThis wasn\u2019t a surprise. He\u2019d expected this.\nDistantly, behind the clenched teeth and the blackness of his lids and his own attempts to clear his thoughts, he hears the witch announce:\n\u201cThough it may have been unfair of me to take what I did so quickly. I cannot return what is gone without risk to your town, but I can give you one moment if you\u2019d like. An echo of the emotion. Would you like to say goodbye?\u201d\nAnd Derek\u2019s eyes are open, going wildly from the witch to Stiles.\nAn echo, a moment, a goodbye.\nStiles smiles, nods.\n\u201cDo it.\u201d\n.-\nThe witch rises from the chair as though she\u2019d never been bound at all, touches a finger to Stiles\u2019 forehead, and falls back.\nFor a second he doesn\u2019t feel anything. Still just the same old Stiles living in his same old Stiles brain. Which is\u2026 kind of disappointing, actually. Maybe his love for Derek hadn\u2019t been all that\u2014\nDerek.\nIt hits him all at once, shuddering through him, flooding out across every inch of him. He loses sense of everything outside his emotions, would hit the ground if a pair of arms didn\u2019t catch him. He quakes, gripping at the form desperately, sobbing out a wet, aching breath into the fabric of the shirt.\n\u201cStiles\u2026 you ok?\u201d\nIt\u2019s Scott. Scott he can handle. Scott he can think about without feeling like tiny bits of his soul are dying. His eyes squeeze shut and tears bleed out into the t-shirt and god, he hadn\u2019t realized he\u2019d been so empty before.\n\u201cScott, I don\u2019t\u2026 I didn\u2019t know\u2026\u201d\n\u201cStiles,\u201d Scott says softly. \u201cTalk to Derek.\u201d\nThat\u2019s right. Derek\u2019s in the room. Derek\u2019s not just a feeling in his heart, in his head, racing through him and leaving him weak, desperate, terrified. He\u2019s here.\nAnd his eyes are shooting back open because who knows how long he has, how long the \u2018echo\u2019 bouncing around inside of him will last, and pushes shakily back from his friend\u2019s chest, scanning the room for\u2026\n\u201cDerek.\u201d\nHe\u2019s standing about eight feet away, isolated from everyone else, shoulders drawn in and jaw tight, looking so scared and hurt and hopeful. It\u2019s enough to wrench another sob out of Stiles, a thousand words clawing at his throat. All that comes out, thick and broken, again, is \u201cDerek.\u201d\nHe\u2019s moving forward without thinking about it, stumbling the five endless steps to reach him.\nAnd he\u2019d never said anything, never done anything when it really mattered. When he\u2019d still really felt this. Why the hell had he wasted all that time? Why had they both?\nHe\u2019d never kissed Derek like he was his whole world, never gripped him close and taken comfort in his warmth, never told him how much he matters and how much he deserves to be happy\u2026 and now Derek\u2019s looking at Stiles like he\u2019s terrified of him, like he might run away if he weren\u2019t too paralyzed to move, and when Stiles throws his arms around him he\u2019s so tense. Trembling. He doesn\u2019t move to return the embrace and\u2026\nDamn it, this is all wrong. Derek\u2019s held onto him before, Derek\u2019s kissed him and breathed longing words into his skin and he remembers it, remembers it enough that his legs feel weak with the need for it. But now it matters, now it means everything, and Derek\u2019s gone cold.\nIt\u2019s Stiles\u2019 turn.\n\u201cI love you. I do\u2026 Derek I-I\u2026\u201d That's as far as he gets before he breaks off. A tear falls onto Derek\u2019s neck and he kisses it, wet and messy, sniffing hard and drawing back fast.\nHe\u2019s a wreck. Sobbing, his eyes puffing up and, great, he has who knows how many more seconds of caring what Derek thinks of him and he\u2019s gonna spend them a blubbering mess? He sucks in a hitching breath and feels Derek\u2019s arms tentatively close around him.\nIt\u2019s like they\u2019ve never touched before. When Derek\u2019s face dips to bury in his neck he shivers harder. His whole body\u2019s quaking now, eight months of emotional catch up and guilt, god, the guilt\u2026\n\u201cShh,\u201d Derek\u2019s breathing against him, hand going to cup his neck, still so tentative, like this is a dream that\u2019ll disappear if he holds it too hard.\nAnd it will. Fuck, it will. What the hell had Stiles agreed to?\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t fair. God, I\u2019m such a dick, I shouldn\u2019t have said yes. I\u2019ll be fine in five minutes and you\u2019ll be\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI love you.\u201d\nStiles cuts off, jerking backward to stare. Derek lifts his head, and his eyes are wet too, red-rimmed and watery.\nStiles\u2019 throat catches. It\u2019s beautiful.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve never said that. I mean, I knew, but you never\u2026\u201d\nDerek\u2019s lips press together, part again. His eyes are still so scared, scared and sincere.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to say it when it didn\u2019t matter. Now I had a chance to.\u201d\nStiles\u2019 hands lift to clutch Derek\u2019s face, thumbs trailing across those open features: soft and honest and... love. Now he knows what it feels like to be loved.\nTo love back.\n\u201cI am so sorry.\u201d\nDerek leans in. His lips brush Stiles\u2019 cheek, kissing away a fresh tear, and Stiles\u2019 eyes flutter. He doesn\u2019t let them close, though. He needs to see every second of this.\n\u201cI love you.\u201d\nThey blurt it together, tripping over the words in a rush to get them out. Like it\u2019s the most important thing in the world, like it\u2019s all that matters.\nAnd Stiles does have a thousand other things to say \u2013 how Derek has to move on, how he shouldn\u2019t let anyone treat him the way Stiles has been treating him. How he deserves so much more, and Stiles is so sorry, and he just wants to stay here, hold onto this forever.\n\u201cI love you.\u201d\nHis lips brush Derek\u2019s now, just barely, and they both stop to gasp at the sheer sensation of it, and\n\u201cI love you.\u201d\nKissing deeper, slower than Stiles has ever let them move before. All slowly dragging tongues, aching emotion and silent promises of forever that neither of them can keep. He doesn\u2019t want to let go, doesn\u2019t know how much time passes before they\u2019re forced to break away, gasping for air and\n\u201cI love you. I love you, Derek. My love\u2019s holding a whole fucking town together, you understand that? You do that to me. You have no idea\u2026\u201d His cheeks are sticky, salty with tears that could come from either of them because Derek\u2019s gasping in a harsh breath and dragging their cheeks together like he needs to feel literally everything in this moment.\nIt\u2019s familiar, the stubble on his skin, the rough, raw heat of the contact, but it\u2019s never been this good before. It\u2019s never meant this much before.\nAnd Derek\u2019s voice is a low rasp of raw emotion as he breathes \u201cI know, I know. Stiles, I\u2014\u201d\nThey\u2019re kissing again and it\u2019s faster this time, desperate and urgent because any second now this will be gone, and he needs to make sure Derek feels it. Needs to kiss him so hard it reverberates through him, so it touches each piece of his stupid, self-deprecating soul. So he remembers when all this is wrenched away again that he was loved, that he deserves to be loved.\nIt\u2019s hard and it\u2019s messy, and it\u2019s broken by both of them gasping hitching breaths into it\u2026 and Derek\u2019s actually crying for him. Near-silent, hitching sobs that shudder through both of their bodies and Derek loves him.\nDerek loves him.\nHe\u2019s known it for months and he\u2019s never once appreciated how amazing that is. It shouldn\u2019t be possible, after everything Derek\u2019s gone through. After his nightmare of a life, every time he\u2019s been lied to and hurt and abandoned, after all he\u2019s lost\u2026 it should take a miracle to let Derek love. It should take something so special, someone strong and worthy and beautiful\u2026 but somehow he has it in him to love Stiles.\nStupid, impulsive Stiles who wished his love away without a second thought.\n\u201cYou deserve better,\u201d he breathes as they stop again for air. He presses their foreheads together, looking into those golden-green eyes and watching the colors shift and blend through the tears. Derek\u2019s clutching his waist and caressing a hand down his nape and he\u2019s never felt safer, more grounded, in his life. How can this feeling ever go away? How can there ever be a moment when this isn\u2019t everything?\n\u201cI deserve you,\u201d Derek growls back. Stiles\u2019 lips twitch. Derek just admitted he deserves something and damn, if that\u2019s not progress, he doesn\u2019t know what is.\nKissing therapy. That should so be a thing.\nHe presses in slow and soft against Derek\u2019s lips, and hears a quiet, contented noise that could\u2019ve come from either one of them.\n\u201cYeah, you do.\u201d He draws back, grinning dazedly, trailing his fingers down Derek\u2019s face. \u201cYou deserve happy. I\u2019d make you so goddamn happy, Derek.\u201d\nA tear catches in Derek\u2019s eyelashes and hangs there, impossibly suspended. The lashes are so thin, so fragile; they shouldn\u2019t hold all that weight.\nHe watches the teardrop until Derek leans in and brushes their noses together. It\u2019s sweet and a little bit sexy, and the most adorable thing that\u2019s ever happened in Stiles\u2019 life.\n\u201cDerek Hale. Did you just Eskimo kiss me?\u201d\nDerek\u2019s brows scrunch together, and that right there's definitely the second cutest. Bunnies and baby puppies just gotta make way for the unholy adorableness that is Derek Hale.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not\u2026 it\u2019s a wolf thing, alright? Nuzzling.\u201d But Derek\u2019s lips are twitching.\n\u201cOh yeah, sure. Big Bad Wolf with his tough Eskimo kisses. Sticking the wolf label on something doesn\u2019t cover up the cuteness.\u201d\n\u201cYou think I\u2019m cute?\u201d\nStiles laughs and the choked, guilty feeling in his chest loosens. He can almost pretend they\u2019re just hanging out together in Derek\u2019s loft, not surrounded by staring friends and a witch who\u2019s just counting down the seconds until she can tear all this away again.\nCan pretend that he\u2019s anything more than just an echo right now.\nHis hands clench nervously, but he manages to keep his expression steady and light. He\u2019s going to hold onto this, damn it.\nHe\u2019s going to give Derek this memory.\n\u201cI think you possess the capacity for cuteness, yes. And I\u2019d really enjoy you being cute again.\u201d\nDerek drifts in closer, brushes the tips of their noses together, and then rolls in close and proceeds to kiss Stiles so thoroughly he loses track of his legs. Thank god Derek\u2019s holding him up or he\u2019d be splayed out on the ground like a Stiles-shaped welcome mat, some kind of cheesy greeting for broody werewolves with a wicked tongue and a fondness for Eskimo kisses stamped across his chest.\n\u201cOr not cute,\u201d he gasps when Derek finally pulls back, rubbing their noses together firmly for good measure. \u201cNot cute\u2019s really good too.\u201d\nDerek smiles, but it seems like an effort suddenly. His eyes flit away toward the witch, and he\u2019s going guarded again, like he\u2019s just remembered how close this is to ending.\nStiles knows he\u2019s terrified of the deadline, possibly more than any second after. That moment when he\u2019s still holding onto Stiles, still open and vulnerable, and Stiles just stops caring.\nHe silently swears to himself that he won\u2019t go stiff suddenly, that he\u2019ll stay loose against Derek and let them ease out of it, do you hear that, emotionally stunted future self? Derek deserves that much. A second to recover, to compose himself, to reset the walls Stiles would do anything to tear down permanently.\nAnd Stiles feels a flutter of panic too. He needs to say his Important Things, and gets as far as \u201cDerek, when this is\u2026 don\u2019t let me\u2026\u201d before Derek cuts him off with a firm headshake and a fresh kiss. Stiles groans into it, faint and needy.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to hold onto every second of this,\u201d Derek breathes when their lips break. He goes to kiss Stiles\u2019 ear, biting soft nips across the shell. \u201cI don\u2019t want to remember you worrying.\u201d\nAnd Stiles\u2019 head lolls to the side, mouth hanging open to gulp in enough air, but he can\u2019t let Derek distract him. His fingers scrape down Derek\u2019s rough cheek and he turns again, slowly, catching Derek\u2019s eyes.\n\u201cWell tough, big guy. I\u2019m gonna worry. That\u2019s what love is.\u201d\nHis heart breaks a little when Derek\u2019s lip trembles.\nDerek\u2019s been hurt enough, damn it. Stiles should be here to look out for him, to keep him safe. But since that's not possible, best friend tag team will have to do. He clears his throat.\n\u201cScott, buddy. You listening?\u201d\nScott\u2019s voice floats over, high and embarrassed.\n\u201cUh\u2026 kinda can\u2019t help it, dude.\u201d\n\u201cGood. Ok, listen: don\u2019t you fucking dare let me mess with Derek anymore, got it? I give you full permission to threaten, blackmail, or body-check me into being less of a douche.\u201d\nBecause he won\u2019t want to stop. He knows himself enough to know that. He\u2019ll remember how amazing everything in this moment feels. He\u2019ll hold it up as a template for every future relationship, hold up Derek\u2019s devotion and the way they feel curled around each other right now and the way his heart\u2019s aching with a desperation bordering on panic for it never to end. And he\u2019ll come back to Derek looking to feel it again, to recapture some small fraction of it, every time another relationship falls short.\nAnd how can they not fall short? How can any new relationship be measured against this slowly built bond between him and Derek? The years of circling, fearing and wanting and loathing and learning to trust, learning to care\u2026 And you know what, maybe Stiles does believe in true love just a little bit, and if it\u2019s out there, Derek\u2019s his. No future substitutes will fit the bill.\n\u201cScott.\u201d He needs to hear it. Especially because Derek\u2019s already shaking his head like he\u2019s disagreeing, like he knows he\u2019ll come back and take whatever small shred of Stiles he can get.\n\u201cYeah, yes Stiles. I promise.\u201d\nStiles nods. He knows he can trust that. Scott\u2019s promises are golden.\nBut the look in Derek\u2019s eyes is scaring him.\n\u201cHey,\u201d He runs a hand down his cheek, down the line of his neck. \u201cDerek, you promise me too, ok? You love me, then you listen to me. You said you deserve me, right? Well that guy you\u2019ve been with? He\u2019s not me. At least when it comes to you. And you deserve someone who loves you like I do.\u201d\nHe leans forward until their foreheads touch again, trails a hand down until it\u2019s hovering over Derek\u2019s heart, until he can hear it pounding fast into his palm.\n\u201cDon\u2019t insult what we have here by going back to that guy.\u201d\nDerek lets out a small, broken sound and tries to smother it in a new kiss, and Stiles grips his neck and holds his gaze and\u2014\n\u201cOh, let the town burn, I say.\u201d\nThe new voice falls on the room like a physical weight. Stiles knows the exact instant when Derek registers what he\u2019s heard from the way his eyes flare blue from pure shock, how he clenches Stiles hard before going frighteningly limp against him.\nIf Stiles weren\u2019t holding him, he would\u2019ve stumbled.\nIt\u2019s Malia who speaks up first, tentative.\n\u201cPeter?\u201d\nStiles looks toward the loft doorway, frowning. Everyone else is doing more of a gaping fish impression as the man in question spares a brief smile for his estranged daughter before turning a more self-satisfied smirk toward Derek.\n\u201cWhat did I tell you, nephew? Human love. It sparks spells, it guards cities.\u201d\nDerek swallows, and Stiles trails a soothing hand down his side.\n\u201cHow are you\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAlive? I\u2019m more surprised that you believed I was dead. You should have more faith in me than that by now.\u201d And then he\u2019s strolling into the loft, nodding at Scott, sparing a too-toothy grin for Lydia, before landing his gaze on the witch.\n\u201cWell, if you all aren\u2019t willing to allow Beacon Hills to collapse as a testament to your love, I suppose we\u2019ll have to make another trade instead.\u201d\nStiles spares a glance toward Derek, but Derek\u2019s eyes are locked on Peter. And Stiles feels a sudden flash of resentment because they have all of who knows how many seconds left, and Peter couldn\u2019t have waited until his echo faded out to make his stupid grand entrance?\nHe burrows his forehead against Derek\u2019s neck, and feels Derek\u2019s fingers stroke, fast and soothing, across his nape.\nThe witch narrows her eyes thoughtfully but Derek\u2019s the one who speaks up, voice barely a growl.\n\u201cWhat other trade?\u201d\nPeter smiles, light and wry.\n\u201cI was never much cut out for family, Derek. Honestly, do you have any idea how much looking after you require? But free me of my ties and I\u2019ll be able to go on with my life without the nagging urge to check up on you constantly.\u201d\nStiles\u2019 head shoots up so sharply it almost slams into Derek\u2019s jaw. He can\u2019t seriously mean that\u2026\nDerek\u2019s back to gripping Stiles hard, like he needs the help to stand. His gaze flits to Malia, then back to his uncle.\n\u201cThe spell\u2026 the most important thing\u2026 The thing you love most is yourself.\u201d\nWhite teeth flash.\n\u201cThat might be true, but that doesn\u2019t preclude a bargain. You must learn not to always take things at face value, Derek.\u201d He glances back to the witch. \u201cBoth of them, will that do?\u201d\nShe tilts her head, stares at him, through him.\n\nBoth of them.\n\n\u201cI think it might.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Derek snaps, falling away from Stiles, taking a sharp step forward. He\u2019s looking at Peter like he\u2019s never seen him before. At the other edge of the room, Lydia moves smoothly to Malia\u2019s side, linking their arms. Malia glances down, then back up quickly, seeming startled. Stiles feels unbalanced, standing on his own again, and Peter looks his way, eyes dancing.\n\u201cWould you rather lose your boy again, Derek?\u201d Derek\u2019s grasping Stiles\u2019 arm in an instant, tugging him forward until he can feel Derek\u2019s heat against his side. \u201cI thought not.\u201d\nStiles feels a fresh wave of joy that Derek cares, and then second, rolling wave of irritation at being led around. At the clinginess of it. He blinks, shakes his head, finds himself clutching Derek\u2019s shoulder like an anchor.\n\u201cDerek\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThe echo\u2019s fading.\u201d This from the witch, and Derek\u2019s hand moves from Stiles\u2019 arm to his waist, tugging him closer. \u201cA replacement sacrifice could be arranged, as long as it\u2019s something the bearer finds truly precious.\u201d\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t.\u201d Derek\u2019s lips thin. Then to Peter. \u201cYou don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cHe does,\u201d Stiles finds himself breathing. \u201cHe tracked down the witch for us.\u201d\nDerek\u2019s eyes go to Stiles \u2013 confused, wounded, disbelieving.\n\u201cThen\u2026 he tracked her down for himself. He wanted to make this deal.\u201d\nStiles glances to Peter.\n\u201cWell, yeah. Two birds, right?\u201d\nAnd Peter inclines his head.\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s why my nephew needs you.\u201d\nPride. Suffocation.\nIt isn\u2019t happening the same way this time around, the emotions washing in and out as the echo slowly fades from him. He whimpers, throat tight. He doesn\u2019t want to go back to the way he was, doesn\u2019t want to lose this.\nBut Peter is Derek\u2019s family. His last tie to his childhood. He\u2019d been so broken when Peter died that he\u2019d fallen into Stiles\u2019 arms even when he\u2019d known better.\nStiles can\u2019t be selfish with Derek.\n\u201cHe needs you too.\u201d But Peter just rolls his eyes.\n\u201cI\u2019ve given you all months to adjust to my untimely demise. You seem to have dealt well enough with life without me. Now, stop arguing and allow us all to get what we want.\u201d Derek makes a soft noise of protest, muscles jumping in that way they do when he\u2019s about to dive into trouble headfirst, make some big, stupid heroic sacrifice. And Stiles\u2019 heart clenches because he couldn\u2019t take that. He couldn\u2019t take it if he was on the other side of this, if Derek started looking at him with blank eyes, like he barely existed.\nAssuming he'd be Derek's sacrifice.\nBut Peter beats Derek to it, catching his gaze, eyes flashing blue, teeth baring warningly.\n\u201cI want this freedom, Derek. After six years in a hospital, skin peeling, mind lost in a haze of burning and the screams of my dying family\u2026 I want to leave this town in the dust and never look back. Do you understand?\u201d\nDerek just stares, but when Peter turns back to the witch, he doesn\u2019t move to stop him.\n\u201cNow, I want it to be them, you understand me? I don\u2019t want to find myself giving up my cleansing regime or turning into a clumsy-tongued simpleton.\u201d\n\u201cThat won\u2019t be a problem.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the boy?\u201d\n\u201cYour sacrifice will replace his. He will be as he was before he surrendered it, as he is now.\u201d\nAt the other edge of the room, Malia is pulling free from Lydia\u2019s grip, stepping forward.\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 me. One of \u2018them,\u2019 is that me?\u201d She sounds wary, unsure. Peter\u2019s eyes close briefly before he turns back to face her.\n\u201cYou barely had a chance to know me, child. You don\u2019t understand the bullet you\u2019re dodging.\u201d\nShe presses her lips together, scanning his face. Takes several more steps, and leans in to kiss her father\u2019s cheek.\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that.\u201d\nAnd then she\u2019s turning away, moving back to huddle beside Kira at the edge of Derek\u2019s bed.\nDerek\u2019s breaths are coming out sharp and fast, nostrils flaring with each one. The witch starts to lift her hand and he spits out sharply, \u201cPeter.\u201d\nThe witch pauses, Peter turns. Derek\u2019s still gripping Stiles like a lifeline, but he shifts slightly in his grip, nervous and unsure. His mouth opens, closes, before:\n\u201cI forgive you.\u201d\nPeter\u2019s brows go up.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s even possible for you to mean that, but I appreciate the sentiment. I\u2019ll treasure it fondly for the next several seconds.\u201d\nHe turns expectantly back to the witch, and she lifts a hand.\n.-\nPeter\u2019s gone ten minutes later. He smirks, his eyes lighter than Stiles has ever seen them as they slide past Derek and Malia. His sacrifices. He leaves behind instructions that if they\u2019re ever in dire need of his services, to have Lydia be the one to call.\nThough as adamant as he was to leave Beacon Hills behind him forever, Stiles thinks he\u2019ll probably veto any attempts to contact the man again.\nWhat? He\u2019s definitely got veto rights. Not only is he the Alpha\u2019s best friend, he\u2019s the former Alpha\u2019s boyfriend.\nHe\u2019s Derek Hale\u2019s boyfriend. Derek Hale is his boyfriend. And that thought\u2019s never going to stop bringing a dopey grin to his face, and he\u2019s 100% ok with that.\nHe changes all of his passwords to \u201cDerek\u201d because he knows it would make Peter\u2019s eyes roll, and then he changes them to something Marvel-related a week later when the next movie trailer comes out.\nThey spend lazy afternoons lounging in each others\u2019 arms, and way too many nights making out in Stiles\u2019 Jeep even though they\u2019ve got a perfectly good loft handy because \u201cI\u2019ve had fantasies about this since you were bleeding black goo on my seats, ok?\u201d and Derek\u2019s a wonderful jerk who rolls his eyes like it\u2019s a huge inconvenience and indulges him.\nAnd when they tell his dad, just a few days after everything, he just sighs, says \u201cit\u2019s about time\u201d and drags Derek away for long, private \u201cI own a gun and I\u2019ve got access to wolfsbane\u201d talk that Derek comes out of looking more flattered than anything.\nAnd they\u2019re in love. With each other. At the same time. And they both know about it.\nAnd enemies attack and werewolves try to take their territory and Lydia\u2019s powers keep developing in new and creepy ways and Kira starts getting tails of all things but\u2026\nThey have each other.\nBasically, things are perfect.\n.-\nHe finds Derek outside the burnt-out Hale house one day, staring at the makeshift grave he\u2019d made for Peter almost a year back. Stiles leans against him and Derek loops an arm around his waist without thinking about it, like it's the most natural thing in the world, like they\u2019ve been doing it for years.\nStiles takes a few seconds to savor the ease of it all, before breathing \u201cYou miss him?\u201d\nDerek shakes his head, expression quiet, unreadable.\n\u201cI keep waiting for the spell to fail.\u201d\nOf course he does. Derek can never just sit back and take his happiness... but that's ok, because Stiles loves forcing him to deal with it.\nStiles leans down to press a kiss into Derek\u2019s shoulder.\n\u201cHey, he cared about you as much as he knew how. Cared so much he ran a long con to get rid of the feelings.\u201d A second kiss into his neck, savoring the way Derek\u2019s next breath drags out a little deeper, steadier. \u201cHe waited half a year to make sure you\u2019d be ok without him.\u201d Nipping at his jaw. \u201cHe checked me out first to make sure I\u2019d be worthy of you.\u201d And then he's leaning in, stopping to hover a breath away from Derek's mouth, grinning. \u201cYou know, this town only still exists because of two people\u2019s love for you.\u201d\nWhich is pretty awesome, all things considered. Physical proof, no way Derek can deny it.\nDerek\u2019s eyes are soft and light as he leans in to brush their lips together.\n\u201cMine would hold the state together.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, big guy? How about the country?\u201d\nDerek's lips go to his ear, hands heavy on his hips.\n\u201cThe world, Stiles. For you.\u201d\nAnd Stiles smothers a grin in a long and slow kiss, promises of forever neither of them know if they can keep... but they both intend to try.\n\u201cLet's just hold the world in one piece together.\u201d\nDerek smiles.\n\"Fair enough.\"\nBecause some things have too high a price."
