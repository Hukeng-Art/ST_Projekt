    "text": "Zuko was probably more involved in the gossip around the palace than he had any right to be.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not his fault, it\u2019s really not. It\u2019s just that sometimes he\u2019s sitting in the kitchens (the best place to get the gossip) drinking tea and trying to relax for once, and some of the kitchen staff will start gossiping where he can still hear them. He doesn\u2019t really try to listen in; it\u2019s not his place and he won\u2019t judge the staff based on whatever rumors are running around, but Spirits is it interesting. And no one ever really tries to keep their voice down when the gossiping starts, so Zuko doesn\u2019t even need to try to eavesdrop, really. He tries not to listen too much, or get too invested in it though. Gossip is gossip after all, and rumors hardly ever turn out to be true.\u00a0\nBut Zuko absolutely needs to know if Maya from the laundry room broke up with her piece of shit boyfriend.\u00a0\n(She did. Zuko gives her a raise after he overhears her telling one of the other staff members about it and how happy she is now.)\nSo, Zuko starts to actively listen in on the gossip, though he keeps his commentary to himself. The men and women who come into the kitchens almost every night to drink and talk and gossip welcome Zuko into the meetings with open arms and wicked sharp smiles. Zuko worries for a little while that they only let him hang around and listen because he\u2019s the Firelord, but they dispel that line of thought quickly.\u00a0\n(\u201cYou know,\u201d Zuko says after he\u2019s ushered down into a chair at the small table in the kitchen. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to let me sit and listen to you guys. If you\u2019d be more comfortable without me here, there\u2019s no consequence in asking me to leave.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous, Lord Zuko,\u201d Shin says. \u201cGossiping with the Firelord is the most fun I\u2019ve ever had. Don\u2019t take this away from us.)\nUncle says they ask him to listen and talk with them because they trust him not to judge or get angry about the gossip, and they want to bond with and get closer to him. Sokka and Toph tease him for becoming an \u2018old lady\u2019 who sits and gossips all day (but they still ask him to keep them updated, the hypocrites). Zuko is still skeptical, but listening to his staff gossip like school children is maybe the most fun thing to come from being Firelord, so he ignores his caution and allows himself to continue.\u00a0\nHe doesn\u2019t even think of participating in or meddling in the gossip and rumors. Zuko may not have many boundaries with the palace staff because he actually likes to, you know,  treat them like people, but he draws the line at meddling in their personal lives unless they specifically ask him for help.\u00a0\nThat is, until he hears that Hana and Li who work in the gardens have been pining after each other for months and are doing nothing about it.\u00a0\n(\u201cI swear, Li just straight up dropped the watering pail he was holding when he saw Hana come into the garden. The poor boy\u2019s got it so bad.\u201d\n\u201cYou think that\u2019s bad? Hana could hardly string two words together a few days ago when Li complimented her haircut. Neither of them can function in front of the other.\u201d)\nZuko doesn\u2019t think much of it at first beyond,  oh boy this is gonna be good. He\u2019d venture that he knows both Hana and Li pretty well. As well as the Firelord could for two of the palace staff, anyway. But, Hana and Li are both close to Zuko\u2019s age, and they work in the gardens, where Zuko spends a lot of his spare time in. So, they overlap a bit. Hana is a sweet girl who started working in the palace after her uncle retired from his guard post, and Li is a soft-spoken boy who likes to work in the gardens because it appeals to his artistic side. Zuko is familiar enough with both of them to see where people got the idea that the two may have feelings for each other.\u00a0\nZuko firmly tells himself that he won\u2019t meddle unless he gets actual confirmation from both of them that they like each other.\u00a0\nThe Spirits must decide to call his bluff, because one week after he hears the initial gossip, Zuko gets confirmation that they like each other.\u00a0\nHe\u2019s been spending an afternoon in one of the gardens, taking the opportunity to read through some of his paperwork in the nice weather. Sometime after he\u2019d gotten there, Hana had entered the garden to do whatever her duties had consisted of that day and she and Zuko were idly chatting as they both worked. After Hana finishes watering the plants and Zuko has read as many painful documents as he can for the time being, Zuko walks with Hana back inside. On their way in, they run into Li, who was heading out to the garden. They say hello, and Zuko gets to witness the absolute disaster energy they radiate around each other. Just looking at Li, Hana blushes a bright pink and stumbles over her hello. Li, not to be outdone, takes one look at Hana and can\u2019t even speak for a moment before he rushes out his greeting and explains that he was just coming to check out the new seeds he planted, all the while turning a brilliant shade of red as Hana nods along with his rambling. He trips over his feet as he walks away.\u00a0\n\u201cWow,\u201d Zuko says after Li has walked away. \u201cAnd I thought  I was bad around people I liked. But that was something else.\u201d\n\u201cNot another word, Lord Zuko,\u201d Hana says. \u201cAnd don\u2019t even think of meddling, I can see it in your eyes.\u201d\u00a0\nZuko holds his hands up in surrender and steadfastly does not promise not to meddle.\u00a0\nThe next day, something similar happens, though this time Zuko is with Li. Li had come to find him and take him to one of the gardens, something about wanting to show off the new flowers he planted and how they were taking to the garden.\u00a0\n\u201cThey make for really nice scenery,\u201d Li is saying. \u201cI can\u2019t wait until they finish blooming, it\u2019ll be a really nice spot to paint. The lighting is great there, the sun hits it just right.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it will be,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to show me the finished project once you do end up painting it.\u201d But Zuko barely gets the words out before Li is gasping and harshly tugging Zuko into one of the shadowed doorways. Zuko\u2019s guards immediately go on high alert and Zuko is stuck staring at Li in shock. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d\n\u201cSorry!\u201d Li whispers. \u201cNothings wrong!\u201d\n\u201cWhat the hell just happened then?\u201d Zuko demands.\nLi blushes a bright red and shuffles on his feet. Zuko has a sinking feeling he knows what just happened. \u201cUm,\u201d Li hedges. Zuko raises his eyebrows. \u201cI saw Hana in the garden and panicked,\u201d Li mumbles out.\u00a0\nZuko\u2019s eyebrows raise further. One of his guards lets out a badly muffled laugh.\u00a0\n\u201cWow,\u201d Zuko deadpans. \u201cHonestly, the absolute heterosexualness of this whole thing is too much for me. Just tell her you like her.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t just tell her I like her! What if she doesn\u2019t like me? Then our whole friendship is ruined!\u201d\u00a0\nZuko really can\u2019t handle this. He just keeps staring at Li with his eyebrows raised and his arms crossed. \u201cDon't say or do anything, Lord Zuko! I can see it in your face that you\u2019re thinking about it.\u201d\u00a0\n Does my face really give away that much? Zuko wonders, and sets that thought aside for later. He doesn\u2019t respond, just hums and walks away, leaving Li still hiding in the shadows and his guards trailing behind him holding back laughter.\u00a0\nZuko lets it simmer for about a week to see if anything changes between Li and Hana. When nothing does, Zuko decides it\u2019s time to take matters into his own hands.\u00a0\nZuko goes to the head groundskeeper, Rai, and asks him to schedule Li and Hana to do their duties together. It\u2019s not uncommon, the gardeners and landscapers tend to work in pairs often to make the work go by faster and to be less taxing on their bodies, especially during the hot summer months. Zuko ignores that it\u2019s currently spring.\u00a0\n\u201cYou want me to schedule Hana and Li to do their chores together? Why? They\u2019re both good workers and are more than capable of doing it themselves?\u201d Rai looks nervous to be questioning an order from his Firelord, but his confusion trumps his need to just obey without questioning.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be real with you, Rai,\u201d Zuko says, completely straight-faced. \u201cI\u2019m trying to play matchmaker and it is painful watching them dance around each other like this. Don\u2019t take this away from me.\u201d\nRai blinks, closing his eyes as if to rethink his entire life (he definitely is, Zuko is wholeheartedly embracing his dramatic side for this one). Rai opens his eyes and Zuko is still standing there in front of him patiently waiting.\u00a0\n\u201cYou want to play matchmaker with Hana and Li?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Zuko nods firmly.\u00a0\nRai seems to think things over for a moment before he says, \u201cYeah, okay. I see it. But don\u2019t you think this will be a little obvious?\u201d\n\u201cOh, absolutely,\u201d Zuko says and Rai gapes at him. \u201cThe best part is they both already suspect me of trying to meddle.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThen why\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBecause  Hana knows that  I  know she likes Li.  Li  knows that  I know he likes Hana.\u201d\n\u201cBut they don\u2019t know they like each other,\u201d Rai finishes.\u00a0\n\u201cExactly.\u201d\n\u201cSpirits, this sounds like a bad Ember Island play.\u201d Zuko raises his eyebrows at him. \u201cOf course I\u2019m in, let\u2019s do it.\u201d\u00a0\nThree weeks after Hana and Li\u2019s schedules have matched every day and Zuko avoids the gardens like the plague, Zuko finally hears that they\u2019ve started dating. He spies them in a garden together one afternoon, heads bent together and giggling, and gets a beaming thumbs up from Li. Zuko makes his way to his next meeting with a smug grin on his face.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nZuko swears that\u2019s the one and only time he\u2019ll meddle in palace gossip.\u00a0\nHe goes back to his gossip sessions with the kitchen crew and is met with knowing smiles and chuckles. Zuko ignores them and pretends he doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about when they call him out on interfering.\u00a0\n(\u201cHonestly, Firelord Zuko, we didn\u2019t know you had it in you.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n\u201cMhm, sure.\u201d)\nSo Zuko goes about his days as normal. Which is to say, he goes to meetings, deals with stubborn, harsh generals and advisors who still like to disagree with him about everything,  and works on instilling changes around the nation to help them heal from the war. Things are getting better, but it\u2019s slow going, and it\u2019s painful, and it drives Zuko crazy more often than not. He gets reassured often by his friends and the advisors that are on his side, but it doesn\u2019t stop Zuko from being frustrated about it all.\u00a0\nWhen Zuko has the time, he goes down to the kitchens to sit in on more gossip nights. It\u2019s a calming way to spend the evenings and it works to take his mind off the stress of being Firelord.\u00a0\nThis particular night, he hears a piece of gossip that piques his interest.\u00a0\n\u201cHave you guys heard?\u201d Shin asks. \u201cOne of the servants is pregnant.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful,\u201d Lei says, taking over pouring them cups of tea.\u00a0\n\u201cIt would be,\u201d Shin says. \u201cIf her husband didn\u2019t leave the second he found out she was pregnant.\u201d\nThat is met with various exclaims of outrage, hurt, and indignation on behalf of the servant. \u201cWhich poor girl is it?\u201d Lei asks. \u201cI\u2019ll go set her husband straight.\u201d\n\u201cLet him leave,\u201d Xian mumbles. \u201cIf he was cowardly enough to leave in the first place, he has no business coming back.\u201d\n\u201cHer name is Ikki. I overheard her talking to one of the guards the other day.\u201d\nZuko knows that there is in fact a servant by the name of Ikki, who recently let all of her supervisors know that she was pregnant, and so her work would have to be lighter for the time being. Things like that were usually run by Zuko first so he could decide whether or not to hire someone to help lighten the load and then approve maternity leave. He\u2019d known, vaguely, that she was married, but didn\u2019t know anything about her husband.\u00a0\n\u201cDoes anyone know her husband\u2019s name?\u201d Zuko asks innocently.\u00a0\n\u201cFirelord Zuko, you cannot send the man to prison for being a shitty excuse for a person,\u201d Lei warns him.\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d Zuko waves a hand. \u201cBut it\u2019d be a shame if he was caught committing some kind of tax fraud or something as soon as Ikki\u2019s name has been removed from anything connecting them.\u201d\nShin bursts out laughing, \u201cHis name is Oroka.\u201d\n\u201cHm, of course, I won\u2019t do anything unless I can be certain. Don\u2019t worry, Lei,\u201d Zuko says.\u00a0\nOf course, Zuko knows that he won\u2019t cause any trouble unless he knows for sure that Ikki and her husband have split for good, and Ikki won\u2019t be upset if Zuko does do anything. Zuko has no interest in making the woman any more upset than she probably already is. So, once again, he bides his time and tries not to make it too obvious that he\u2019s fishing for information. Zuko reads Ikki\u2019s file under the pretext of learning when her pregnancy is set to end and when he should send her out on maternity leave. While reading it, he sees that her husband\u2019s name is in fact Oroka, and he owns one of the clothing shops near the docks. Zuko makes note of the fact that when he later looks up the man\u2019s shop, Ikki\u2019s name is already nowhere near the paperwork. The more Zuko reads up on the man, the less he likes him.\u00a0\n Three counts of drunken assault and one complaint from a former employee about bad business practices,  Zuko thinks.  Maybe I won\u2019t have to make up a charge if he already has this many.\u00a0 \nSo Zuko is planned, prepared, and ready to send this man\u2019s life into a tailspin, but he\u2019s still worried about stepping out of bounds and upsetting Ikki. It\u2019s been a few months now, and her belly has rounded out to show off her pregnancy. She\u2019s still coming to work most days of the week, but she\u2019s been making sure to not do anything too strenuous. For the most part, her job has consisted of patching up old clothes and doing some sewing, with the occasional light chore. Zuko thinks this may be a perfect opportunity to speak with her about her upcoming maternity leave and sort of ask for her permission to make things a lot more difficult for her husband.  Ex-husband?  Zuko thinks. I\u00a0don\u2019t actually know if they\u2019re still together. Oh well, I guess I\u2019ll find out soon. \u00a0\nHe finds Ikki in one of the servant rooms and asks her to come to his office so they can have a quick chat. (Zuko will never stop being pleased with how the staff no longer looks so afraid when he\u2019s around. He\u2019s put a lot of work into making sure they know he won\u2019t hurt them, and he\u2019s glad it\u2019s paid off). She follows him to his office happily and they make small talk about how she\u2019s been on the walk there.\u00a0\n(At one point, Ikki stops in the hallway, placing a hand on her stomach and smiling widely.\u00a0\n\u201cIs everything alright?\u201d Zuko asks.\n\u201cOh, yes,\u201d she says. She takes one of Zuko\u2019s hands and presses it gently to her stomach. \u201cThe baby\u2019s just kicking.\u201d Zuko\u2019s eyes widen and he gasps when he feels a little bump against his hand.\u00a0\n\u201c...Does that hurt?\u201d Zuko asks, mystified.\u00a0\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt,\u201d Ikki laughs softly.\u00a0\nZuko is absolutely going to ruin Oroka\u2019s career.)\nThey sit down in Zuko\u2019s office and he makes a point to discuss the actual things they need to discuss before he brings up the damned gossip that\u2019s taken over way too much of his attention span. They decide that Ikki will start her maternity leave in a month\u2019s time, putting her at the seven-month mark of her pregnancy. The maternity leave extends to five months past the date of birth, and even then, Zuko insists that she only came back to work part-time and will be able to leave again if she so wishes. Zuko refuses to lower her pay even a little, (\u201cI won\u2019t be working, Firelord Zuko, I can\u2019t justify taking this much money.\u201d \u201cIkki, you are about to have a newborn baby and I\u2019m trying really hard to not offer you more pay, please accept you\u2019re normal pay rates.\u201d) Eventually, they come to an agreement that boils down to Zuko giving Ikki her regular pay and not adding any bonuses, but not for lack of trying on his part. Ikki makes to leave, but Zuko stops her with a;\n\u201cActually, just another moment, please. If you don\u2019t mind me being less than professional for a moment.\u201d Ikki stops, sitting back down and looking intrigued.\u00a0\n\u201cUm,\u201d Zuko says awkwardly. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re probably aware of the, uh, gossip? That\u2019s been going around lately?\u201d\n\u201cOh, that my husband found out I was pregnant and just up and left?\u201d Ikki says blatantly.\u00a0\nZuko winces, \u201cUh, yeah, that.\u201d Ikki is silent for a moment while she thinks something over.\u00a0\n\u201cHe did leave,\u201d she says eventually. \u201cOur divorce was finalized last month.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that. I can\u2019t imagine this has been easy for you. And I can\u2019t fathom why a husband would do such a thing,\u201d Zuko says softly.\u00a0\n\u201cIs that why you\u2019ve been so kind in this meeting?\u201d Ikki asks.\u00a0\n\u201cNot really,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cI mean, the whole trying to give you at least one bonus thing was since there\u2019s no longer two sources of income in your home. But everything else, the not lowering your payment and all the time off and leeway with that, I\u2019ve done the same with all the other men and women who\u2019ve gone on maternity leave.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cGood,\u201d Ikki nods. \u201cI was a little worried about that.\u201d\n\u201cI do have one more thing to ask you, though,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cWhat would you say if his clothing store suddenly came under investigation for bad business practices and employee mistreatment?\u201d\nIkki laughs so hard that Zuko worries for a moment that she\u2019ll fall over.\u00a0\nTwo weeks later his storefront is shut down while the investigation takes place. Zuko goes to gossip night with his head held high and takes the ribbing and teasing without protest.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nZuko knows that he\u2019s setting a precedent with how he involves himself in gossip, but he really couldn\u2019t care less. Until it comes to bite him in the ass, he\u2019s going to keep going to gossip nights and using his newfound information to help his staff out.\u00a0\n(\u201cKeep saying shit like that and the gossiping is gonna come bite you in the ass sooner rather than later,\u201d Sokka tells him once.\u00a0\n\u201cSo you don\u2019t\u00a0wanna know if Ikki gave birth to a boy or a girl, and how they\u2019re doing?\u201d\n\u201cI take it back, tell me everything.\u201d)\nUnfortunately, Zuko is still the Firelord, which means he has things to do other than attend gossip night. He\u2019s been swamped in work lately, and his yearly meetings that take place in the other nations to discuss peace have snuck upon him. So, he\u2019s now discussing last-minute travel details, confirming that the meetings are still on track to be held at all, preparing for said meetings, and still managing his regular duties. Zuko doesn\u2019t mind the trips, he likes traveling to the other nations, and it gives him an excuse to see everyone again. Plus, the meetings have been getting easier to have; no one is nearly as hostile as they were during the first meeting and everyone finally agrees that peace is the way to go. At this point, the meetings are more for formality than they are for necessity.\u00a0\nZuko\u2019s leaving for his first trip in a week, and he hasn\u2019t made it to gossip nights in about three, and damn it he just wants to relax a little before he has to leave. He\u2019s been spending the night going over travel plans and at this point, nothing else is going to get finalized tonight, so he sets the paperwork aside, and heads to the kitchens.\u00a0\nWhen he enters the kitchen, the group is deep into the middle of some kind of card game. They look up when he enters, calling out their greetings. \u201cDeal you in, Firelord Zuko?\u201d Shin asks.\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d Zuko shakes his head, taking a seat. \u201cWhat\u2019s the topic tonight? I need distractions.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about Ling\u2019s shitty supervisor and how creepy he is,\u201d Xian says while laying a card down.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat do you mean creepy?\u201d Zuko asks.\u00a0\n\u201cHe keeps asking her out,\u201d Lei explains. \u201cEven though she\u2019s easily twenty years younger than him. And she\u2019s told him she\u2019s not interested every time he brings it up.\u201d\n\u201cDid you hear that he asked her out again earlier today? She said no, of course, so he scheduled her to work the same hours as him tomorrow so he could ask again,\u201d Xian says in disgust.\n\u201cCreepy,\u201d Shin says. \u201cHe\u2019s been doing it since she got hired. And isn\u2019t that like, the tenth time this month?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cAt the very least,\u201d Xian replies. \u201cI heard that he grabbed her arm when she tried to walk away from him the other day, too.\u201d\n\u201cWhat.\u201d Zuko deadpans. He can tell that his face has gone frosty and works to not look quite so angry. The people around the table shift uncomfortably.\u00a0\n\u201cOne of the servant girls, Ling, keeps getting asked out by her supervisor, Mao. It started out benign. Easy to ignore. But it seems like it\u2019s very quickly moving into harassment territory,\u201d Lei explains.\u00a0\nZuko takes a deep breath and turns to one of his guards. \u201cGo find me his record. And if he\u2019s still here send him to my office.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYes, Firelord Zuko,\u201d the guard says, leaving immediately. Zuko wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the man started running. Zuko rarely ever shows his temper around the staff, saving it for meetings with cruel generals, but he\u2019s having a hard time keeping it in right now.\u00a0\n\u201cUm, Firelord Zuko?\u201d Lei says carefully.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m going to read his file,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cAnd if there\u2019s even one infraction on there, I\u2019m going to fire him. I can\u2019t believe something like that has been happening right under my nose.\"\n\u201cNo one has reported anything since you\u2019ve been Firelord. You couldn\u2019t have known,\u201d Shin tries to assure. \u201cAnd Ling has said more than once that she can handle things herself.\u201d\nZuko just hums, as his guard reenters the kitchen, holding out a file to him. \u201cGuard Rin is escorting the man to your office, sir. She caught him on his way out.\u201d\n\u201cGood, thank you.\u201d\n\u00a0The group is quiet around him as he opens the file and begins reading. The more Zuko reads the angrier he gets, and he knows the disgust shows on his face despite his best efforts.  Mistreatment of subordinates, inappropriate behavior, and oh would you look at that, multiple complaints of sexual harassment towards younger staff. All of the man\u2019s infractions and complaints have either been dismissed or investigated to be false. Then, Zuko reads one line in his employment contract that makes everything make sense.\u00a0\n Of course he was hired by my father,  Zuko thinks bitterly.  No wonder nothing ever happened to him. How the hell does someone like this slip through the cracks? \nZuko snaps the folder shut, takes a deep breath, and stands. \u201cI have to leave for my diplomatic trips in a few days. I can\u2019t give this situation the attention it deserves, right now. I\u2019m going to fire him right now, and as soon as I get back, I\u2019m doing a full investigation into anyone who has complaints like this on their files or anyone who was hired around the same time. It never should\u2019ve happened in the first place, and I\u2019m sorry it went on for as long as it did.\u201d\nZuko leaves the kitchen without looking back.\nZuko makes his way to his office with his guards in silence. When he gets there, Mao is standing with Rin, one of his guards. Zuko tries not to be too satisfied with the fact that Rin is giving the man one of her best glares and Mao is cowering from it.\u00a0\n\u201cInside. Now,\u201d Zuko commands as he opens the door. Mao shuffles inside quickly, his head down. Zuko rounds his desk, standing beside his chair, not able to handle sitting at the moment. He opens up Mao\u2019s file to the pages detailing his various reports and complaints, and slams it down on his desk.\u00a0\n\u201cYou want to explain that to me?\u201d Zuko makes eye contact with the man and allows the fire from the torches in the room to burn brighter.\u00a0\nMao carefully picks up the papers, looking them over. \u201cThese are nothing, Firelord Zuko. All of these accusations are from years ago. They\u2019ve all been investigated and dismissed.\u201d His voice is wavering, and Zuko lets the flames go higher.\u00a0\n\u201cReally,\u201d Zuko deadpans. \u201cIf I read that correctly, and I\u2019m sure I did, only one of those instances was investigated, and it ended with the employee who reported you being fired. None of the others detailed an investigation, only being dismissed as false accusations. Are you saying there\u2019s no substance to these claims?\u201d\n\u201cOf course, my Lord. These things are just lies.\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019re telling me that three young women who have worked with you in the last six years have reported you for sexual harassment and misconduct for what? For fun? For attention?\u201d\n\u201cObviously those women were just trying to get ahead and ruin me,\u201d Mao says angrily.\u00a0\n\u201cReally? Explain to me what\u2019s been going on with one of your recent hires, Ling.\u201d\n\u201cThat girl? She\u2019s a flirt. She\u2019s wanted me since the day she was hired. Has she been saying differently?\u201d\nZuko makes his way around the desk, standing in front of the man. He picks up the file, flipping through the pages until he finds his employment contract. He holds it in his hands, reading it over again. As before, his eyes are drawn to his father\u2019s signature.\u00a0\nZuko looks Mao in the eyes and says, clearly and strongly, \u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d\u00a0\nMao sputters, backing up and trying to defend himself. Zuko cuts him off. \u201cDo you know what this paper is?\u201d Mao looks at it for a moment.\u00a0\n\u201cMy employment contract,\u201d Mao grinds out between his clenched jaw.\n\u201cSigned by you,\u201d Zuko says moving to stand right in front of Mao. \u201cand someone who is no longer in charge.\u201d\nMao swallows.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re fired,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cFor sexually harassing other employees, trying to hide it, and other misconduct towards your subordinates.\u201d\n\u201cYou, you can\u2019t do that!\u201d Mao tries to say.\n\u201cOh I can\u2019t, can I? Last I checked, I was the Firelord, and could do whatever I want,\u201d Zuko says. Mao fumbles, trying to recover.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cHow about this?\u201d Zuko says pleasantly. He holds Mao\u2019s old contract in one hand, and with the other, makes a small ball of fire.\u00a0\nHe lights the contract on fire.\u00a0\nThe paper burns, turning to ash in Zuko\u2019s hand. He lets his other hands keep the fire for a moment longer, keeping eye contact with Mao.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re fired,\u201d Zuko repeats. \u201cIf you\u2019re smart, you will keep your mouth shut. You will leave the palace, and you will not set another foot near here again. Any belongings that you have here will be sent to your home tomorrow. And if you don\u2019t do exactly that, I have no qualms with setting you on fire. And don\u2019t think I won\u2019t be keeping an eye on you. If you ever do something like this again, you are going straight to prison. I can excuse many things, but one thing I  will not  excuse is sexual harassment and assault.\u201d\nZuko finishes speaking and finally lets the fire in his hand dissipate. As soon as he\u2019s done, Mao practically runs for the door.\u00a0\n\u201cMake sure he actually leaves,\u201d Zuko says to one of his guards. He gets a nod in return and the guard leaves. Zuko sighs heavily, sinking down into his desk chair and burying his head in his hands. Zuko spends the rest of the night in his office, going through as many personnel files as he can, and setting aside the ones that look suspicious.\u00a0\n(Ling comes to find him the next day, and she thanks him for getting rid of Mao.\u00a0\n\u201cI was afraid if I reported him that no one would believe me,\u201d she says quietly. \u201cI talked to so many others who said that nothing happened when they reported him, so I didn\u2019t even bother.\u201d\n\u201cI promise you,\u201d Zuko says earnestly. \u201cI would never ignore a report like that. I wish I had known sooner. And I swear to you, this will never happen again.\u201d)\nZuko thinks he\u2019s going to have a lot to fill the others in on when he starts his trips.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe next piece of gossip Zuko hears that he feels the need to involve himself in, happens about three months after his diplomatic trips. Zuko spent a lot of time after he returned going through every little thing he possibly could, and making it clear that behavior like Mao\u2019s would not be tolerated. Zuko ends up firing five more men and one woman with similar reports and the testifications to back up the claims. Some of them try to deny or come up with excuses, some of them admit to it, and Zuko fires all of them.\u00a0\n(\u201cYou threatened to set him on fire?\u201d Sokka exclaims when Zuko fills him in on the drama that\u2019s been happening around the palace while he\u2019s in the South Pole. \u201cThat\u2019s kinda badass, I wish I\u2019d been there. Maybe you should\u2019ve. Sounds like the guy deserves it.\u201d\n\u201cIf he ever comes anywhere near the palace again, I\u2019m gonna lose it,\u201d Zuko mumbles.\u00a0\n\u201cSo much has been happening since I\u2019ve been gone. I can\u2019t wait to get back. I wanna join gossip night,\u201d Sokka pouts.)\u00a0\nThis particular piece of gossip isn\u2019t nearly as troubling as before, thank the Spirits. Zuko doesn\u2019t know what he would do if he found out that more things like that had been happening right in front of him. Currently, Zuko is walking down one of the halls, on his way to a meeting, when he pauses in to rearrange the paper\u2019s in his arms. There, he accidentally overhears two guards talking in the next hallway over.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cHey, Kai, your wedding anniversary is coming up soon, right? Any plans?\u201d One of the guards says.\n\u201cNo, but not for lack of wanting,\u201d the other one replies. \u201cFeng\u2019s got me working the night shift that day. I asked to switch shifts with someone but it\u2019s a no go.\u201d\n\u201cSeriously? That\u2019s fucked man, maybe you can drop a hint to Ming. I know he\u2019s only the head guard for Firelord Zuko\u2019s personal guards, but maybe he\u2019s got some influence.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll think about it, otherwise we\u2019ll just celebrate a different day.\u201d\nZuko looks over to Ming, who shrugs helplessly. Zuko hums, puts his thoughts of meddling aside for now, and continues walking to his meeting.\u00a0\nLater in the afternoon, Ming comes into Zuko\u2019s office with the guard schedule for the week and casually places it on Zuko\u2019s desk. Zuko raises his eyebrows at him and Ming just gives him an innocent smile.\u00a0\n\u201cJust food for thought,\u201d Ming says casually. Zuko waits until Ming goes back to his position outside the office door before picking up the schedule. Zuko looks over the schedule and notices that Kai, the guard from earlier, is scheduled to work the night shift four days in a row, with the day of his anniversary in the middle.\u00a0\n\u201cHey, Ming,\u201d Zuko calls out. Ming enters quickly and Zuko ignores the smug grin on his face. \u201cI thought guards weren\u2019t meant to work the night shift more than three days in a row?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not supposed to, no, sir,\u201d Ming replies. Zuko nods and picks up an ink brush and crosses out Kai\u2019s name for the night of his anniversary.\u00a0\n\u201cHave someone take this back to the supervisor,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cTell him I was going over the schedules and found some issues, and if he has a problem with it, to come to me.\u201d\nThe supervisor does not have a problem with it. Zuko doesn\u2019t bother to hide his smirk.\u00a0\nZuko goes to gossip night the next week and listens cheerfully as they gush about Kai telling them about his anniversary.\u00a0\n\u201cIt sounded so sweet, the way he described it,\u201d Lei sighs. \u201cCooking her a nice dinner and then taking it to go sit on one of the beaches.\u201d\n\u201cIt did sound really cute,\u201d Shin admits. \u201cFinding a secluded part of the beach to just sit and spend time together.\u201d\n\u201cAnd then repeating their vows to each other. So romantic. Why don\u2019t we do things like that anymore?\u201d Lei says smacking Xian on the shoulder.\u00a0\n\u201cOw! Jeez, no need to be violent. We do plenty of romantic things,\u201d Xian says rubbing his shoulder.\u00a0\nLei looks like she\u2019s gearing up for a fight, so Shin speaks up to distract her. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s lucky that his schedule got cleared so suddenly for the night. The way he was talking, it sounded like he was going to have to work the whole week.\u201d\n\u201cIt  is  lucky, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Lei jumps at the change of topic to Xian\u2019s relief. \u201cI wonder who cleared it for him.\u201d She gives Zuko a  look.\u00a0 \n\u201cHm, it must\u2019ve been some pretty good luck indeed,\u201d Zuko smiles into his teacup.\u00a0\n\u201cOh, come off it,\u201d Xian laughs. \u201cWe all know you\u2019re the king of meddling.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Zuko maintains. \u201cI\u2019ve never meddled a day in my life.\u201d\nThat particular line is met with various reactions of laughter, indignation, and downright shock. Amongst the sudden cacophony, Zuko calmly sips his tea.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThings in the Fire Nation and around the palace have been fairly peaceful recently. There haven\u2019t been any major catastrophic events, Zuko\u2019s managed to weed out some more generals that are still arguing against peace, he\u2019s passed some new laws to make recovery easier, and he\u2019s finally managed to update the school curriculum to be satisfactory instead of chock full of propaganda. No major dramatic scandals have happened around the palace, the only gossip going around isn\u2019t centered around corrupt supervisors, but instead is little things like; \u201cwe caught the head chef feeding the stray cats around the palace again\u201d or, \u201cHana and Li got caught making out in a garden. I know we all wanted them to get together, but come on.\u201d\u00a0\nSo, things have been really good recently. Zuko recently got a letter from Sokka confirming his next stay in the Fire Nation as Ambassador of the Southern Water Tribe instead of just a visitor. This means that this time Sokka will be staying for a few months at the latest, and Zuko is excited to have him back. All goes well, Sokka will be there by the end of the next month. Of course, Zuko still has plenty of work as the Firelord, and he\u2019s sure this feeling of comfort won\u2019t last for long. Soon enough things will go back to being hectic. Something or other will happen, and everything will go back to full swing.\u00a0\nBut for now, it\u2019s nice to just bask in it.\u00a0\nZuko finds himself basking in it one night, sitting in the kitchen, once again sitting in on gossip night. The four of them are sitting at the table, playing a card game, and talking about whatever is coming to mind. Earlier, Xian had broken out the alcohol, and although Zuko had declined, he still watched in humor as the others got pleasantly tipsy. They had at first been talking about how Ikki had recently returned to the palace and all the cute stories she had shared about her newborn son, (\u201cI heard that her garbage of an ex tried to come crawling back because business still hasn\u2019t picked back up for him, and she laughed and shut the door in his face.\u201d). The conversation progresses to kids from there, (\u201cMing was saying the other say that one of his daughters recently got accepted into a really nice school. It will be such a wonderful opportunity for her.\u201d). And eventually tapers off into Shin mopping about being single, with Lei trying to be sympathetic and Xian not trying to hide his laughter.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you,\u201d Shin is saying placing another card down. \u201cIt\u2019s weird how many couples there are in this place. Like, what\u2019s in the water in the palace that makes people like each other? And why am I still single? Am I not drinking the right water?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be so dramatic,\u201d Xian says. \u201cThis is a place of serious business and respectability, not a dating ground.\u201d\n\u201cEasy for you to say, you and Lei have been happily married for twenty years! And you guys met here!\u201d\n\u201cThe man has a point dear,\u201d Lei says. \u201cIt seems that since Firelord Zuko has taken the throne, people are much more willing to show their love for each other.\u201d Zuko feels his face heat a bit and Shin fake gags at the look of adoration on her face as she looks at Xian.\u00a0\n\u201cRight! Lord Zuko even set some of them up himself. We\u2019ve got Hana and Li, and then Rin and her girlfriend,\u201d Shin begins. \u201cAnd then we\u2019ve got already established couples like you two, the couple who runs the laundry room, those two guards Ai and Hachi--\u201d\n\u201cAi and Hachi are dating?\u201d Zuko interrupts. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that.\u201d Shin slaps a hand to his mouth, and Lei smacks his shoulder, hissing his name. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\nLei sighs. \u201cAi and Hachi have been nervous about coming out,\u201d she explains. \u201cFor palace guards, they don't work around you much, so they weren\u2019t sure how you would take it. Everyone knows how Azulon and Ozai were about those things. Especially two men together.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYeah tell me about it,\u201d Zuko mumbles. It doesn\u2019t seem like they really hear him.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll just have to set them straight,\u201d Lei decides.\n\u201cHe can\u2019t really  set them straight, though, can he?\u201d Xian snickers.\u00a0\n\u201cYou know what I mean! Lord Zuko, you\u2019ve been so accepting of who people decide to love, repealing those awful laws and everything. If you just have a chat with them, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll relax.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cUh,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cYou guys do know that the reason I repealed those laws was because I\u2019m gay, right? Like, not straight even the tiniest bit.\u201d\u00a0\nThey stare at him in shock.\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d Shin says. \u201cNo, we did not know that.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHuh,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cI thought it was pretty obvious.\u201d\n\u201cBut, but weren\u2019t you dating Mai?\u201d Lei asks.\u00a0\n\u201cAh, yes, the very safe, heterosexual relationship approved by my father? Yeah, we did date for a little bit, and then again when I became Firelord so no one started breathing down my neck about an arranged marriage. And, of course I love her, but not like that.\u201d\n\u201cSo, the laws\u2026?\u201d Xian asks.\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, that wasn\u2019t just for being accepting and all that. I mean, of course, I am. But I\u2019m trying to be husband material, not just secret boyfriend material.\u201d\n\u201cBoyfriend!?\u201d They all exclaim.\u00a0\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d Zuko says, having fun with this now. \u201cWe\u2019ve been dating for a while now. We were really careful to hide it all in the beginning, but we thought we\u2019ve been more obvious lately.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d Shin starts whispering. Lei and Xian are still staring at him in shock.\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d Zuko says, standing up. \u201cI think I\u2019m gonna head to bed now. I\u2019ll be sure to talk to Ai and Hachi soon.\u201d\u00a0\nZuko leaves them in the kitchen still mumbling to themselves and has to muffle his own laughter. The guards walking with him don\u2019t even try to hide it.\u00a0\nZuko does, in fact, find Ai and Hachi to speak with them. They\u2019re outer perimeter guards, and so he doesn\u2019t see them much. They\u2019re stationed together, which makes this a bit easier. He begins by asking them about the perimeter, and how things have been. Not that long ago, an assassin disguised as a traveling merchant had tried to get catch them off guard and make his way into the palace.\u00a0\nThey\u2019d taken him down in seconds. Zuko didn\u2019t even know it had happened until hours later.\u00a0\nSo Zuko uses this excuse to find them and strike up a conversation. Now that he\u2019s looking for it, he can see the tension coiled beneath their skin, muscles tight and expressions closed off. Zuko makes a point to keep his voice light and conversational, and not at all like he\u2019s about to judge them. They only relax minutely after about ten minutes of talking and it\u2019s clear Zuko\u2019s not here to call their capabilities as guards into question or start spouting homophobic shit.\u00a0\nAfter he\u2019s drawn the conversation out for as long as he can, Zuko looks towards the docks, where the sun is just beginning to set and casting an orange light over everything. He gets an idea.\u00a0\n\u201cHave either of you ever been to the docks around this time?\u201d he asks, aiming for casual innocence. \u201cIt really is beautiful with the sunset and everything.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t say I have ever have, my Lord,\u201d Hachi says carefully.\u00a0\n\u201cYou guys should try it. It makes for a really good date spot. My boyfriend and I have before,\u201d Zuko says, casting a look over at them. They\u2019re both staring at him in shock.\u00a0\n\u201cReally?\u201d Ai is the first to break. He looks hopeful.\n\u201cMhm,\u201d Zuko nods. \u201cPack a picnic, watch the sunset. And it\u2019s always quiet over there, lots of privacy.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cInteresting,\u201d Ai says. \u201cWe just may have to try it out.\u201d\nZuko sends them both a smile, Ai still looks a bit shocked, and Hachi is a bit nervous, but neither of them looks afraid. \u201cI hope you do,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cAnyway, thank you for indulging me in conversation. Have a wonderful night.\u201d\n\u201cYou as well, Firelord Zuko,\u201d Ai says.\n\u201cAnd thank you for the conversation, the pleasure was all ours,\u201d Hachi finishes.\u00a0\nZuko walks back inside after sending them both one more smile. He hopes he\u2019s managed to help the two become just a bit more comfortable.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGossip night, as it\u2019s now been dubbed, initially began during Ozai\u2019s time. It started, not as a need for the staff to pass time with idle gossip, but out of self-preservation. At the end of every night, a group of staff members would converge in the servant\u2019s quarters, hidden by dark and shadows. There, they would quietly and thoroughly go over all the things that had angered Firelord Ozai during the day. They would figure out his little ticks, what set him off, who he gave second chances, and who he sent straight to prison. They would take this information and spread it to every staff member in an effort to keep everyone safe. Back then, it had been about survival.\nNow that Firelord Zuko has taken the throne, that initial need is gone.\u00a0\nOh, they had still met up at the beginning of his reign. At the dead of night and sneaking to the servant\u2019s quarters to examine every move the new Firelord had made that day. Trying to figure out where they stood with him.\u00a0\nAs time went by, they realized that Firelord Zuko was nothing like his father. Nothing a staff member did seemed to anger him, even on the occasions where they tried to push his buttons, just to see what a punishment would be.\u00a0\nIt became evident that Firelord Zuko would not punish them for the same things his father would.\u00a0\nFirelord Zuko still dolled out the occasional punishment, but only as he saw fit rather than on a whim. This tended to happen when staff members were still actively supporting Ozai, were plotting against him, or had done something the Firelord saw as immoral. And even then, the punishment was rarely more than being fired. Everyone remembered how Firelord Zuko had reacted towards the staff members that had been harassing others, and no one wanted a repeat of the burning anger that had been rolling of the Firelord.\u00a0\nAs time went by, and the staff learned that the only reason they would be punished was if they were doing something illegal, they all started to let their guard down.\nAnd so gossip night turned into gossip night. A proper, school ground gossip session, complete with whispered conversations and all.\u00a0\nThey eventually moved gossip night into the kitchens. Shin already worked there, so it wasn\u2019t totally out of nowhere. (Plus there were snacks). After some time, they noticed that Firelord Zuko spent a lot of time in the kitchens, and often late at night. At first, they were a bit wary of how he would react to them gossiping, but that wariness was quickly dispelled.\u00a0\n(One night, Firelord Zuko had entered the kitchen and had been sitting at the counter for some time now. He hadn\u2019t been down there in a few weeks at least, so they let him be and went about their conversation as if nothing was out of the ordinary. Suddenly, they noticed Firelord Zuko coming to the table.\u00a0\n\u201cHi,\u201d he said quietly and with a small smile. \u201cSo, I haven\u2019t been in here in a while. I\u2019ve been pretty busy. But I\u2019ve been listening in for a while and none of you have mentioned it, so did Maya ever break up with her shitty boyfriend? Or not yet? It\u2019s been bothering me for weeks.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOh, Lord Zuko,\u201d Shin had said, motioning for Firelord Zuko to take a seat. \u201cYou just listen to how she broke up with that garbage fire of a man.\u201d\nAfter that, they had welcomed Firelord Zuko to gossip nights with open arms.)\nFor some time after that, a hot topic of gossip nights would be who the Firelord was dating, if he was dating at all, or who he may like. Ever since he and Mai had broken up, no one had seen the Firelord show interest in anyone. Of course, they never discussed this with him, keeping their speculations to nights that Firelord Zuko never showed.\u00a0\nAt first, they thought it might have been Hana, from the gardens. The two spent quite a bit of time together and seemed comfortable around each other. They were worried that Firelord Zuko may end up getting his heart broken, since the girl so clearly had a crush on her coworker Li.\u00a0\nThen, Firelord Zuko decided to meddle and get Hana and Li together. They were kind of out of options after that. There was speculation of some of his advisors maybe having crushes on the Firelord. But, nothing was concrete enough to suggest that Firelord Zuko might return any of their feelings.\u00a0\nThen, he dropped the bombshell on them that he was gay.\u00a0\nNot only that, but that he had a boyfriend. A steady boyfriend. Of a few years.\u00a0\nThe gossip group was in shambles for days as they came to terms with this, and then started trying to figure out just who the mysterious boyfriend might be.\u00a0\n(\u201cYou guys didn\u2019t know?\u201d Li asks them when they go to him for information one day. \u201cHe\u2019s not exactly subtle about the fact that he\u2019s not straight.\u201d\n\u201cWell, how did you know?\u201d they retort.\u00a0\n\u201cWell, considering when he was plotting to get me and Hana together, he said the whole thing was \u2018too much heterosexualness\u2019 for him, I figured he wasn\u2019t totally straight.\u201d\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ever tell us this before?\u201d Shin exclaims. \u201cWe could\u2019ve been trying to figure this out for months!\u201d\n\u201cBecause!\u201d Li looks scandalized. \u201cIt\u2019s not my place to go repeating our conversations to other people. Plus, it didn\u2019t seem like the kind of thing I should go spreading around.\u201d\n\u201cLi, why do you have to be so kind and innocent?\u201d Shin laments.\n\u201cAnd I guess this means you won\u2019t tell us if he\u2019s been going to the gardens to spend time with a boy regularly, will you?\u201d Xian asks.\n\u201cNope,\u201d Li says cheerfully.)\nSo far, they had a few solid competitors. At the very beginning, they contemplated that Firelord Zuko may have had a crush on Li, but noticed that Li was very much straight, and so he set Li up with his crush. They dismissed the thought quickly. As much as they spend a significant amount of time around each other, Firelord Zuko never once acted lovesick around him. That, plus the fact that Firelord Zuko said he\u2019d been with his boyfriend for a while, means Li is out of the running.\u00a0\nNext on their list of possibilities was one of the Earth Kingdom Ambassadors. According to their inside source (one of the advisors who accompanied Firelord Zuko on his recent diplomatic trips), the two men spend an awful lot of time just looking at each other.\u00a0\n\u201cIt could be him,\u201d Shin says. \u201cIt would make sense to try and hide it, too. A relationship with a foreign dignitary? It\u2019d be a political nightmare.\u201d\n\u201cHm, but some of the guards say that they\u2019re always at each other\u2019s throats during meetings. That doesn\u2019t seem very coupley,\u201d Xian argues.\u00a0\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s a ruse,\u201d Lei suggests. \u201cTo keep people off the idea that they may be together.\u201d\u00a0\nNone of them are entirely convinced, so it goes on the backburner for now.\u00a0\nTheir next option is one of Firelord Zuko\u2019s advisors, Fensui, who so obviously has a crush on the Firelord. The young man looks at Firelord Zuko like he hung the moon, the stars, and the sky, and always agrees with him during meetings. They chat occasionally outside of the meeting room, but no one is really sure what they discuss. And, they\u2019re never seen together otherwise.\u00a0\n\u201cMaybe they\u2019re really good at hiding it?\u201d Lei hedges. \u201cFensui does spend a lot of time in the palace, he would know how to sneak around it.\u201d\n\u201cBut why would they need to hide it?\u201d Xian asks. \u201cNo one would oppose to Firelord Zuko having a relationship with a respected and knowledgeable Fire Nation advisor.\u201d\n\u201cPlus,\u201d Shin says. \u201cFirelord Zuko never looks anything other than professional around him. At least we had some solid proof with Li being able to make Firelord Zuko laugh, but with this guy, we\u2019ve got nothing.\u201d\nBack to square one then.\u00a0\nThey try to wheedle information out of Firelord Zuko\u2019s guards, but none of them break. They know that his guards know because each time one of them passes one of Firelord Zuko\u2019s guards in a hallway, they get a teasing smirk. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re hiding the fact that they\u2019re trying to figure it out, which makes it even more frustrating.\u00a0\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Shin whines to Ming. \u201cJust a little hint? Please?\u201d\n\u201cNope, you\u2019re all clever people. Figure it out yourselves.\u201d\n\u201cRin, please, just one bit of information,\u201d Lei almost begs one night. \u201cWe\u2019re at an impasse.\u201d\n\u201cTch, come on, what fun would it be if I just told you?\u201d\n\u201cAi, Hachi, I know you\u2019re not his personal guards but you have to know something,\u201d Xian tries. \u201cSeen someone coming and going from the palace regularly? Spotted Firelord Zuko with someone where it seemed like no one would see? Come on.\u201d\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t you like to know,\u201d Ai smirks at him.\n\u201cTough luck, figure it out yourself,\u201d Hachi says.\u00a0\nThis may be harder than they thought.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n***\n\u00a0\nZuko and Sokka lay next to each other on Zuko\u2019s bed, still basking in each other's presence after so long away from each other. Today was the first day of Sokka being back in the Fire Nation for his three-month stay as Ambassador of the Southern Water Tribe. He and Sokka had had a rare lazy day, stayed locked inside Zuko's room where no one would bother them, ignored their other responsibilities, and spent the day catching up with each other, so wrapped up in one another they hardly moved an inch throughout the day. They were at a lull in conversation, content, for now, to just lay in silence and enjoy the cuddling.\n\u201cSo are the gossip crew still trying to figure out who it is that you\u2019re dating after you so elegantly came out to them?\u201d Sokka asks suddenly.\u00a0\nZuko snorts, rolling over on top of him. \u201cYeah, last week they kept trying to weasel out of me if it was Advisor Fensui or not. Apparently he has a crush on me?\u201d Zuko knows he sounds skeptical, and sees Sokka\u2019s eyes begin to narrow. Zuko knows it\u2019s not because Sokka\u2019s jealous, but because he\u2019s offended on Zuko\u2019s behalf that he could ever think someone didn\u2019t have a crush on him. Zuko\u2019s not really in the mood for another one of Sokka\u2019s \u2018you\u2019re perfect and everyone should love you\u2019 speeches (they still make Zuko slightly uncomfortable, even though he loves Sokka and knows that Sokka loves him). So, Zuko decides that the best course of action is to distract him with a kiss.\u00a0\nZuko leans up and presses a kiss to his lips. Sokka sighs into it, hands gripping at Zuko\u2019s lower back and waist. When they pull back, gasping into each other\u2019s mouths to catch their breath, Zuko is pleased to see that Sokka no longer looks on the verge of a dramatic (well-intentioned) speech.\u00a0Zuko lets out a pleased hum, moving back down to cuddle into Sokka\u2019s chest.\u00a0\n\u201cBut seriously, how many is that now? There was the girl from the gardens before they realized you were gay, then the boy from the gardens, the Earth Kingdom Ambassador, and now the advisor? You sure you\u2019re not just making your way through the staff while I\u2019m gone?\u201d Sokka jokes.\u00a0\n\u201cStop that,\u201d Zuko says, slapping at his chest softly.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m teasing, baby, you know that. I know you would never, and you know I would never.\u201d\nZuko harrumphs, looking up at Sokka and pouting his lips. He\u2019s not upset, but he\u2019ll be damned if he doesn\u2019t use this opportunity to get another kiss. True to form, Sokka coos at him (Zuko nearly pushes him away for that) and cradles Zuko\u2019s face in his hands, peppering him with soft kisses. Zuko supposes he can be forgiven.\u00a0\n\u201cI may have an idea,\u201d Sokka says, still pressing kisses to Zuko\u2019s face.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\nSokka pulls back, looking Zuko in the eyes. He looks so suddenly serious that Zuko sits up on his elbows, focusing all his attention on Sokka.\u00a0\n\u201cI know we agreed to wait until things got more settled,\u201d Sokka says quietly. \u201cBut our families know, and our friends know. About us, I mean. And we know your guards know, too. And I was thinking. Yeah, things are still hectic sometimes, but things are so much better than they were two years ago. Hell, things are better than they were two months ago. We\u2019ve already stopped being so strict about what we do in public. And I just\u2026\u201d Sokka trails off.\n\u201cWant to stop hiding it,\u201d Zuko finishes softly. To be honest, he\u2019s been thinking about it, too. The war is over for good, their nations no longer hate each other, and everyday steps are being taken to make sure nothing like that ever happens again.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about it, too. Things feel solid, now. It doesn\u2019t feel like we\u2019re constantly on the brink of disaster, having to watch our every step. And you\u2019re right, we keep making progress, and it\u2019s  good  progress.\u201d\n\u201cSo what do you think?\u201d Sokka asks softly. \u201cAbout just\u2026 not hiding it anymore? I\u2019m not saying we have to make an announcement or anything. I love you, and I\u2019d love to just be able to hold your hand when we walk down the halls and not worry about anyone seeing us, and pissing someone off.\u201d\nZuko leans in again, giving Sokka a soft kiss. \u201cI\u2019d like that. I love you, too. Though I wouldn\u2019t mind making an official announcement.\u201d\nSokka laughs and hugs him tight. They lay there for a while longer, just breathing in each other\u2019s presence, occasionally pressing soft kisses to any skin they can reach.\u00a0\nThat is, until Sokka sits up, pulling Zuko with him and wearing a shit-eating grin on his face. \u201cYou know,\u201d he says casually. \u201cI\u2019m kind of hungry. Wanna go cause some chaos?\u201d\n\u00a0\n***\n\u00a0\nThe kitchen is empty, save for Lei, Xian, and Shin, who have stayed behind to have their gossip session. Firelord Zuko didn\u2019t join them tonight, so the crew took the opportunity to continue trying to figure out just who their Firelord is dating. They\u2019re about to call it a night, when the door opens suddenly to reveal Firelord Zuko and the Ambassador of the Southern Water Tribe, Sokka.\u00a0\nThe pair walks into the kitchen, so close they\u2019re bumping into each other\u2019s shoulders, and are laughing softly, heads bent together. Almost at once, all of their jaws drop as the realization hits them. The pair heads straight to one of the cabinets, pulling out a box of snacks.\u00a0\n\u201cHey, guys,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cSorry I missed gossip night, I was catching up with my boyfriend.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m the boyfriend,\u201d Sokka says. \u201cHey, can I join gossip night while I\u2019m here? I get the rundown from Zuko anyway and it sounds like fun.\u201d\u00a0\nThey just nod, still in shock, and Zuko and Sokka leave with their boxes of snacks, hand in hand.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d Shin whispers. \u201cSo Firelord Zuko is dating the Ambassador of the Southern Water Tribe?\u201d\n\u201cHow the hell did we not figure that out for ourselves?\u201d Xian asks to no one in particular.\n\u201cWe\u2019re shams, that\u2019s how,\u201d Lei says, burying her head in her hands. \u201cIt was right in front of us and we didn\u2019t notice.\u201d\u00a0\nBy the next night, everyone in the palace who hadn\u2019t already figured it out knows that the two are dating.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0"
