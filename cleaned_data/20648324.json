    "notes": "<p>This started off as a post on tumblr that spiralled out of control. So many people have contributed to the making of this fic--from helping to flesh out this universe, to helping fund it, to supporting me through the long process of writing this beast, to being a beta reader. Can you believe this thing was originally going to be ~15k? Final word count is closer to 45k.</p>\n<p>Thank you to everyone who has been involved along the way. This fic wouldn\u2019t exist without every one of you x</p>\n<p>Edit: Now <a href=\"https://ficbook.net/readfic/9347357\" rel=\"nofollow\">translated into Russian</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#work_endnotes\">more notes</a> and <a href=\"#children\">other works inspired by this one</a>.)</p>\n<p>I want to start by saying a HUGE thank you to everyone for your ongoing support with this fic. I\u2019ve been blown away by the love this fic received both on ao3 and on tumblr. The atla fandom is such a welcoming and fun space and I love you all a lot xx</p>\n<p>Now for the hard part: I have to admit that this fic got ahead of me. I originally intended to make this a full series rewrite, but the plot grew out of control and it\u2019s been almost 5 years of me trying to wrangle it with limited success. It\u2019s time to finally admit defeat. I considered leaving this fic uncompleted, but the consensus on my tumblr seemed to be that people wanted to see the rest of my unfinished draft. So here it is! Half of Book 2 is done and there\u2019s some very brief scenes of what was going to be Book 3 at the end of this chapter. <b>Please note that this chapter is unfinished/technically my wip and so has missing scenes and plot holes.</b> There won\u2019t be a chapter 3 like I\u2019d originally intended, but I\u2019ve included some of my notes/ideas at the end. There\u2019s also some old posts on my tumblr under the \u2018tea boat au\u2019 if you want to live in this universe for a little longer.</p>\n<p>If anyone would like to write for this universe or pick up chapter 3 in my stead, please feel free! I\u2019m more than happy for people to play in the space.</p>\n<p>Thanks again for all your love xx happy reading</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_2_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Thanks again to everyone for being so wonderful and for sticking around for so long</p>\n<p>Come chat with me at captainkirkk.tumblr.com</p>\n<p>Fire Lord Zuko and Chief Yue being world leader!BFFs is everything to me.

    "text": "Zuko was confrontational, once. He trained himself out of it--learned to bite his tongue at war meetings and the dinner-table, in front of snide customers and rude vendors who refused to sell to gold-eyed strangers.\nBut, sometimes, everything builds inside him. An alarming number of Fire Nation warships have been sighted lately, and the weather is still cold, which makes him miss the humidity of Caldera City, which makes him feel twisted-up inside because the thought of returning to the Fire Nation makes him sick--\nIt\u2019s almost a relief when he hears the bitten-off scream. He follows the sound into a back alley, and finds a group of three--and an elderly merchant guarding his purse.\nThe bald man eyes him up and down. Zuko has been a tea server for almost three years, and he dresses like one, too. He\u2019s not worth robbing.\n\u201cFuck off, kid.\u201d\nZuko pulls a knife out of his waistband, the pearl hilt flashing in the moonlight. \u201cLeave him alone.\u201d\nThey laugh, a rough sound that echoes down the alleyway. The merchant looks like he\u2019s going to cry. He looks older than Uncle.\nZuko readjusts his hold on the knife, warming it just enough for the metal to flash gold. They stop laughing, then.\nThey rush him, and he kicks out, a ribbon of yellow fire following the arch of his foot, pushing them back. He dispatches one, and then two, and then whirls on the third. The man spits, \u201cAsh-maker,\u201d and Zuko jumps off the wall and knocks him out with the hilt of his knife.\nThe men are sprawled, unconscious, around him. The merchant had slipped away during the fight.\nZuko stashes his knife away. He\u2019s bruised, he can feel it. Before he goes to breakfast tomorrow, he\u2019ll have to check to make sure everything is covered by his clothes, or else he\u2019ll have to deal with the crew\u2019s fussing.\nAnd then someone says, \u201cYou\u2019re a firebender.\u201d\nZuko turns. In the mouth of the alleyway is a boy. He\u2019s small and brightly coloured, like a bird that\u2019s flown too far South.\nZuko is awkward when customers bring their children onto the Jasmine Dragon, which only makes the crew laugh at him and Iroh grin into his tea. He has no idea how to make this kid go away without scaring him.\nBut he will scare him, if he has to.\nMost people see the Jasmine Dragon with its kitschy second-hand furniture and hand-painted signs and understand that it is both Fire Nation and harmless. That\u2019s not always the case, though. Some people can\u2019t fit the words firebender and innocent together.\nIf this kid goes running through the dark marketplace screaming his head off about a firebender, they\u2019ll get run out of port. Again. And Uncle always looks so sad when they have to escape from angry mobs \u2026\nBut the boy just bounces closer. And smiles. At Zuko. \u201cI told Katara and Sokka that good firebenders existed!\u201d\nThe boy steps into a patch of moonlight, and Zuko sees his big eyes, his orange and yellow robes, the blue arrow tattooed on his forehead.\nZuko knows that symbol, those colours. Before Uncle had fished him out of his fixated depression, he had spent weeks hunched over century-old scrolls, staring at illustrations of long-dead Air Nomads.\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for a firebending teacher,\u201d says the airbender. He\u2019s so young and earnest. Zuko is going to throw up on his shoes. \u201cWill you teach me?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re an airbender,\u201d Zuko says.\nThe boy cocks his head to the side. \u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cAnd you need a--\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d The boy laughs. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m the Avatar!\u201d\nZuko pushes past the kid--the Avatar--and sprints through the port, shoving desperately through the crowd as he goes. The airbender calls after him, \u201cWhere are you going? Hey! Wait!\u201d\nBut Zuko\u2019s lungs are too tight and his vision is beginning to tunnel. He runs up the plank of the Jasmine Dragon and through the familiar corridors, tearing past the baffled crew.\nWhen he\u2019s safe in his locked room, Zuko topples over, landing on his knees. He doesn\u2019t have the Air Nomad scrolls anymore. Uncle convinced him to return them to the Air Temples where they belonged--not just because it was the right thing to do, but also to stop him from being tempted to keep searching for the Avatar. He doesn\u2019t need the scrolls, though. He knows what he saw. He knows.\nHe had abandoned his hunt for the Avatar three years ago.\nBut it seems that the Avatar had found him anyway.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nUncle knocks on the door. \u201cZuko? Are you alright? Jee said he saw you return from the markets in quite a state.\u201d\nZuko buries his face in his knees. It had been some time since he had had such a violent panic attack, and now he just feels weak. Drained of all his energy.\n\u201cNephew? Please open the door.\u201d\n\u201cGo away, Uncle.\u201d\n\u201cAre you hurt? If you\u2019re hurt--\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not hurt!\u201d Zuko\u2019s voice cracks. He closes his eyes, shoves his face in his knees. \u201cGo away.\u201d\nThere\u2019s silence. Then: \u201cIt\u2019s just me, Zuko. I want to see if you\u2019re alright. Please don\u2019t push me away again.\u201d\nZuko will never be able to refuse Uncle, not after everything he has done for him. Not after Zuko decided all those years ago that, if he didn\u2019t want to keep living for his father or his people or even himself, then he would keep living for Uncle.\nHe gets up on shaky legs and unlocks the door.\nUncle looks at him with those keen eyes and pulls him into a hug. Zuko sinks into it.\n\u201cUncle,\u201d he chokes out, \u201cI saw him.\u201d\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\u201cThe Avatar. I used my firebending when I wasn\u2019t supposed to and this boy with airbending tattoos ...\u201d\nHe can feel his throat closing up again.\nUncle closes the door. He guides him to the low table, his hand never leaving Zuko\u2019s back.\n\u201cDo you want to chase after him?\u201d Uncle asks.\n\u201cNo. I gave that up years ago. I don\u2019t want to go back to--\u201d My father. \u201c--the palace. The Jasmine Dragon is my home now.\u201d A thought occurs to him, then. Though Uncle has always seemed so happy running this floating tea shop, entertaining customers below his social status, he has always been very aware that Uncle\u2019s main reason for staying was because Zuko couldn\u2019t return to the Fire Nation. \u201cDo you want to go home, Uncle?\u201d\nUncle brushes hair out of Zuko\u2019s face. \u201cThe Jasmine Dragon isn\u2019t just your home, nephew.\u201d\nZuko nods, because he\u2019s run out of words and his eyes have grown heavy. When Uncle gets up and leaves the room, he knows he\u2019s only going to fetch them tea, but Zuko wants to latch onto his sleeve, anyway.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSokka stares at Aang, the world\u2019s last hope, the Fire Nation\u2019s greatest threat, the nuisance Katara rescued just to make his life infinitely more difficult.\n\u201cAang,\u201d he says, \u201cthe goal is to stay away from firebenders.\u201d\n\u201cBut I need to learn firebending sometime!\u201d Aang protests. \u201cAnd when are we going to find another good firebender? You said it yourself: the entire Fire Nation is against me. How am I going to find a teacher if we avoid all firebenders?\u201d\n\u201cHe does need a firebending teacher,\u201d Katara says. Sokka sends her a betrayed glare, and she raises her hands defensively. \u201cI didn\u2019t say we should trust this one.\u201d\nAang drops onto the log beside her, puppy eyes on full display. \u201cBut Katara!\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know if he really is good, Aang. You said you saw him take down a group of thieves, but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019d be willing to work with the Avatar, against his own people.\u201d\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t try and fight me,\u201d Aang tries.\n\u201cYeah, he ran away when he realised who you were,\u201d Sokka says. \u201cThat definitely screams \u2018make me your firebending teacher.\u2019\u201d\nAang wilts. \u201cBut ...\u201d\nKatara pats him on the shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep an eye out for more good firebenders, okay? We\u2019ll find you a teacher, Aang. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\nSokka scoffs, crossing his arms. A good firebender. As if.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIroh usually holds crew-wide meetings in the mess hall. It\u2019s the largest room on the Jasmine Dragon, and the place where everyone naturally congregates. So when Iroh calls a handful of them into the control room, Jee immediately knows there\u2019s a problem. A teenage-shaped problem.\nIt\u2019s a tight fit with half a dozen adults, but they manage, waiting patiently to hear what happened to the Jasmine Dragon\u2019s youngest crewman.\n\u201cThank you all for coming,\u201d Iroh begins. \u201cI thought it was best to debrief you all as soon as possible. This has shaken Zuko up a great deal.\u201d\n\u201cIs he okay?\u201d Chef says. \u201cI didn\u2019t see him at breakfast. He didn\u2019t get into another brawl, did he?\u201d\n\u201cZuko is resting,\u201d Iroh says, which only makes everyone look more alarmed. The kid is all action; he hates staying still. Iroh waits a beat, then announces, \u201cMy nephew found the Avatar last night.\u201d\n\u201cI thought he abandoned that,\u201d Jee says, wide-eyed. \u201cIt\u2019s a fool\u2019s errand. He couldn\u2019t actually have ...\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps I should rephrase. The Avatar found Zuko.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Jee says. \u201cOh, fuck.\u201d\n\u201cIs he okay?\u201d Chef asks again. Chiyo looks ready to shove her way out of the control room and track Zuko down. As the ship\u2019s designated medic, it\u2019s an expression she wears fairly often.\n\u201cEveryone, please calm down,\u201d Iroh says. \u201cIt sounds as if my nephew and the Avatar only bumped into each other. And it sounds as if the Avatar is even younger than Zuko.\u201d\nJee grimaces. \u201cSir, I know you want to see Zuko make friends his own age, but really. The Avatar?\u201d\nIroh doesn\u2019t look at them. His gaze is focused on the bay outside, the water rippling green-blue beneath the morning sun. \u201cNo, of course not, Jee. Of course not ...\u201d\nThe crew exchange glances. That tone of voice does not bode well for them--or for Zuko.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThat morning, Zuko pours tea like he did when they first opened the Jasmine Dragon, when he was an inexperienced thirteen year old who had spent his entire life being served, not serving others.\nHe knocks over a cup and spills tea across one of the new tablecloths Uncle commissioned from Kyoshi island. Thankfully, the customer at that table is an older woman that seems endeared by Zuko. Or maybe she\u2019s just too busy flirting with Iroh to care. For once, Zuko is too exhausted to be grossed out.\nHe takes the tablecloth down to the laundry room. Chiyo is there, and she laughs when she sees the tea-stained cloth.\n\u201cDid Daichi try and do a trick with the teapot? Don\u2019t follow his lead, kid. You\u2019ll never impress any girls or boys by accidentally spilling tea down yourself.\u201d\nZuko glares down at the ruined tablecloth. Uncle had seemed so excited when they had picked them up last month.\nShe throws a pillowcase at him, and ignores his angry splutters. \u201cWe\u2019re playing cards on deck tonight. You had better be there.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t organise a game night every time you\u2019re low on funds,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cWe know you cheat. No one\u2019s going to bet against you.\u201d\n\u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\nZuko opens his mouth to tell her off, but then Daichi bursts in, apron still on, holding up a still-steaming bowl. \u201cZuko, Chef made fire flakes!\u201d\nZuko squints at him. \u201cChef only makes fire flakes on special occasions.\u201d\nDaichi lowers the bowl. \u201cIt\u2019s, uh. My birthday?\u201d\n\u201cThat was last month. We had a party. You got drunk and tried to tip me overboard.\u201d\nDaichi exchanges panicked looks with Chiyo. Zuko sighs. They must know about last night. About the brightly-coloured boy who barely comes up to Zuko\u2019s shoulder. About the Avatar, seeking him out three years into his banishment. News travels fast on the Jasmine Dragon.\nZuko snatches the bowl of fire flakes out of Daichi\u2019s hands. They\u2019re extra crispy, just how he likes it.\nHe doesn\u2019t like their fussing--but he appreciates it, anyway.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf Kyoshi Island is neutral territory,\u201d Aang begins, \u201cthen you must get lots of neutral ships passing through here. Ships from other nations, even.\u201d\nSokka knows exactly where Aang is going with this. He tries to kick Aang, but he\u2019s too tightly bound, and he only manages to jerk his leg to the side, more a twitch than a proper attack. \u201cAang, quit talking about that firebender!\u201d\nThe very-scary-looking-but-still-a-girl warrior glares down at him. \u201cFirebender?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Aang says, oblivious to the menace in her voice. \u201cHe\u2019s about Sokka\u2019s age, though he\u2019s a little taller--\u201d\n\u201cThe more I hear about this guy, the more I hate him,\u201d Sokka says.\n\u201c--and he has long black hair, and a big scar on his face, and he saves people from dangerous thieves!\u201d Aang smiles at them, far too happy for someone bound and held at fan-point by a bunch of girls. \u201cHe\u2019s a good firebender.\u201d\nGood firebender. No matter how many times Sokka hears that, it doesn\u2019t sound any less ridiculous. Firebenders aren\u2019t good.\nThe girl-warrior brightens. \u201cOh! You must mean Zuko.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve met him?\u201d Aang asks.\n\u201cSure,\u201d she says, looking far less menacing now that she\u2019s talking about Zuko, the firebender, and not their apparent trespassing. \u201cHe serves the best tea I\u2019ve ever tasted. He stopped by only a month ago. His uncle had commissioned a bunch of tablecloths from a local artist. Such a lovely family.\u201d\n\u201cThe nice firebender has a nice firebending uncle,\u201d Aang says gleefully.\n\u201cAre you sure this is the same guy?\u201d Katara asks on the other side of the totem pole.\nThe girl-warrior gestures at one side of her face. \u201cHuge scar? Long braid tied with a yellow ribbon? Gold eyes?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s him!\u201d Aang says.\n\u201cThere is,\u201d Sokka says through his teeth, \u201cno such thing as a good firebender. This guy is conning all of you.\u201d\nThe girl-warriors are back to looking scary again. They brandish their fans at him. Delicate objects should not look so dangerous.\n\u201cHis name is Zuko,\u201d says the girl-warrior, \u201cand he\u2019s our friend.\u201d\nAang beams up at them. \u201cI want him to be my friend too. He\u2019s going to be my firebending master, after all!\u201d\n\u201cFirebending master--?\u201d\nAang flips out of his restraints, landing neatly on top of the totem pole. \u201cI\u2019m the Avatar!\u201d\nThe girls let them go fairly quickly, after that. Sokka rubs at his wrists and glares at Aang, who is too busy soaking up the island\u2019s combined admiration to notice.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis is very good tea,\u201d Katara says. She\u2019s not just making small talk; the tea really is amazing. Maybe the best she\u2019s ever had, even if it does taste as though it has been steeped for too long. \u201cIt tastes almost exotic ...\u201d\n\u201cA good friend of mine delivers it regularly,\u201d Bumi says. \u201cIt\u2019s the best tea in the world.\u201d\nAang perks up. Sokka is already glaring across the table, like he can predict the next words out of his mouth.\n\u201cThe Kyoshi Warriors also mentioned a very good tea they get delivered regularly,\u201d Aang says. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t happen to know a good firebender called Zuko, would you?\u201d\n\u201cWhy, of course. He\u2019s a good lad. Bit surly, but he\u2019s a teenager, what can you do?\u201d\nKatara puts her cup down. \u201cYou\u2019ve met Aang\u2019s firebender, too?\u201d\n\u201cKatara,\u201d Sokka hisses, \u201che\u2019s not Aang\u2019s firebender--\u201d\n\u201cYes, of course!\u201d Bumi says. \u201cI think of him like my very awkward, very grumpy nephew.\u201d\n\u201cEven though he\u2019s a firebender,\u201d Aang says, casting a smug glance at Sokka.\nBumi looks baffled. \u201cAll firebenders aren\u2019t evil, you know.\u201d\n\u201cAll firebenders aren\u2019t evil,\u201d Aang echoes. \u201cSee, Sokka!\u201d\nSokka eyes Bumi, idly dipping lettuce leaves into his tea. \u201cRight. I\u2019ll take his word for it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf Bumi knows and trusts Zuko,\u201d Aang says, \u201cthen I do too. I\u2019ve decided: I want him as my firebending teacher. No one else.\u201d\n\u201cHave you two even had, like, a conversation?\u201d Sokka says, scratching his arm. The feel of creeping crystals lingers on his skin. \u201cYou said he ran away when he saw you. Why do you keep forgetting that part?\u201d\n\u201cI can be very persuasive,\u201d Aang says, smiling the smile of a twelve year old who knows exactly how cute he is. Sokka knew those puppy eyes were on purpose.\n\u201cWe have had two different people confirm that this Zuko character is okay,\u201d Katara says. \u201cI still don\u2019t trust him completely, but if we find him again, we should at least try and talk to him.\u201d\nSokka glares at his traitorous sister, scratching his elbow harder. \u201cFine! Fine. We\u2019ll talk to the firebender.\u201d\nAang cheers, leaping into the air.\n\u201cBut only if we run into him again! It\u2019s a big world. What are the chances that you\u2019ll meet the same person twice?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, look,\u201d Sokka says, pointing. \u201cTea!\u201d\nThe angular ship stands out against the humble fishing boats docked around it. Not just because of its size, but because of the hand-painted banners hanging over the side. One reads, \u201cWELCOME.\u201d Another simply says, \u201cTEA.\u201d\nSokka leads Katara up the gangplank. Mismatched tables are set up across the deck and lanterns are strung up, softening the sharp accents of the ship. It\u2019s a windy day. Sokka wonders how the lanterns stay lit.\nThis floating tea-shop seems safe; most of the tables are full, and the ship is decorated with kitschy furniture and hand-painted signs. And no place that smells this good can be dangerous.\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t we wait for Aang before stopping somewhere?\u201d Katara asks.\nSokka waves her off. \u201cHe\u2019ll find us eventually. He\u2019s probably off having another mini-adventure. In the meantime, we deserve tea.\u201d\nA teenager in a tea-stained apron approaches them. His hair is braided down his back and tied with a canary-yellow ribbon. Sokka tries not to stare at the nasty scar burnt into one half of his face.\nThere\u2019s something familiar about him, but Sokka can\u2019t pinpoint what, exactly. Surely he would remember such a brutal scar stamped across such a pretty face. Surely his nose would remember smelling such amazing tea.\nThe teenager raises a hand in greeting. \u201cHello, Zuko here. I\u2019ll be your server for today. Would you like to be seated or would you like to continue browsing?\u201d\nKatara gasps. Sokka elbows her in the side. It isn\u2019t as if she\u2019s never seen a nasty scar before--people in their tribe have plenty of intense-looking scars from the Fire Nation raids. She should know better than to be rude about it.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll keep browsing, thanks,\u201d Sokka says, and steers Katara towards the display of various teas.\nKatara is still staring at the boy. For once in his life, Sokka hopes it\u2019s because he\u2019s an attractive boy and not because of the burn.\nSokka studies the teas laid out on the embroidered tablecloth. The design is familiar, too. It almost reminds him of the green-blue designs on Kyoshi Island.\nHe picks up a ceramic pot full of orange-red tea and sniffs at it. It smells spicy and almost burnt, like curry simmering over a campfire.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a special Jasmine Dragon blend,\u201d Zuko says, coming up behind them. \u201cIt\u2019s my favourite. Would you like to try some?\u201d\nThe tea server brews them a small sample with quick efficiency. Sokka sips at it. It\u2019s even spicier than it smells, and twice as good. Better than any of the watery tea Sokka has sampled in other towns. Strange, though. Who wants their tea to have a kick to it?\nSokka looks at the tea server again. He\u2019s unnaturally pale for someone who works on the deck of a ship all day, directly under the sun. And at this angle, his eyes seem almost gold.\nSokka blinks. It isn\u2019t the angle. On closer inspection, his eyes are, very clearly, gold.\nWho has gold eyes?\nAnd his accent. It\u2019s subdued and barely there, like a rock worn smooth by time, but he doesn\u2019t sound like an Earth Kingdom native, or speak like he\u2019s from the Water Tribe. Aang has an alien lilt to his words that the tea server is missing, but there\u2019s still something there--a faint, foreign inflection ...\n\u201cWait,\u201d Sokka says, \u201cwait, wait, wait.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m very sorry about this,\u201d Katara says to Zuko.\nZuko blinks at her. \u201cAbout what?\u201d\n\u201cThe big red ship,\u201d Sokka says, gesturing at the seemingly harmless tea shop. \u201cThe foreign features. The weird spicy tea. You\u2019re Fire Nation!\u201d\nZuko stares at him flatly. \u201cAnd what about it?\u201d\n\u201cThe Fire Nation is evil!\u201d\nZuko\u2019s polite expression vanishes. \u201cWe\u2019re just selling tea, we\u2019re not doing anything wrong. We have nothing to do with the war.\u201d\nSokka scowls. \u201cEveryone in the Fire Nation is the same. This whole thing is probably a trap to lure us into a false sense of security!\u201d\nZuko scowls back. His scowl is better than Sokka\u2019s. It\u2019s probably because of the scar. Or maybe people in the Fire Nation just train their kids to master the act of looking angry. \u201cA trap? How could you say that? We\u2019re minding our business and trying to make a living, just like everyone else.\u201d\nSokka points at him. \u201cThat\u2019s what someone setting up a trap would say.\u201d\nKatara puts a hand on his shoulder. \u201cSokka, calm down. Don\u2019t you realise who this is?\u201d\nSokka pulls out his boomerang, brandishing it under the tea server\u2019s nose. \u201cI know exactly who he is, Katara. He\u2019s Fire Nation, and I don\u2019t trust him. Why didn\u2019t he just tell us he was Fire Nation in the first place, if he\u2019s so innocent?\u201d\n\u201cBecause of how you\u2019re acting right now,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cAnd besides, it\u2019s not like we were hiding. The Jasmine dragon is run out of a decommissioned warship.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s right, Sokka,\u201d Katara says. \u201cAnd remember what the Kyoshi Warriors and King Bumi said about Zuko? He\u2019s good. They vouched for him. And so did Aang.\u201d\nThe pieces fit together in Sokka\u2019s head. This isn\u2019t just a rogue Fire Nation citizen, this is the mythical nice firebender.\n\u201cYou\u2019re Aang\u2019s firebending teacher,\u201d Sokka realises.\nZuko takes a step back. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sticking with my trap theory,\u201d Sokka says stubbornly. \u201cThis could all be some big plan to take advantage of Aang\u2019s kind nature. Everyone knows the Air Nomads were super forgiving and nice.\u201d\nZuko looks like he\u2019s going to throw up.\n\u201cLook, I can see Aang from here. Why don\u2019t we just ask him?\u201d Katara leans over the side of the ship, waving her hand in the air. \u201cAang, over here!\u201d\nThere\u2019s a rush of air, and then Aang is perched on the railing, a bag of fruit slung over his shoulder. He opens his mouth. Then closes it. Immediately, he zeroes-in on Zuko.\n\u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201d Aang jumps off the railing and bounces closer. \u201cHello! I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever see you again. Is this your tea shop? Can you teach me firebending?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s you,\u201d Zuko says.\n\u201cAang, stay back,\u201d Sokka says, holding his boomerang like a sword. \u201cThis is probably one big ploy so he could capture the Avatar.\u201d\nZuko laughs. The sound comes up rough and---sad, almost.\n\u201cNo. No, I wouldn\u2019t--\u201d Zuko shakes his head. \u201cGet off our ship.\u201d\nAnother server comes up behind Zuko, eyes narrowed. \u201cAre you okay, Zuko? Are we fighting these guys?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no fighting on the Jasmine Dragon,\u201d Zuko insists.\nThe crewman nods. \u201cOkay, fine. Are we escorting them off the Jasmine Dragon and then fighting them?\u201d\nThin steam wafts out of Zuko\u2019s mouth. It doesn\u2019t look like an intimidation tactic--if anything, he looks like a metal teapot screaming on the stove, spiralling past boiling-point.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Zuko says through his teeth. \u201cThey\u2019re leaving. We\u2019re staying.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m getting Iroh,\u201d says the crewman, before disappearing below deck.\nAang inches a bit closer. Sokka had been worried about Aang\u2019s safety, but in that moment, it looked as though Zuko was the one in danger of being kidnapped. Not Aang.\n\u201cWait,\u201d Aang says, \u201cplease. I\u2019m looking for a firebending teacher and--\u201d\nThe crewman returns with a kindly old man in tow. Iroh touches Zuko\u2019s shoulder and says softly, \u201cNephew, is everything okay?\u201d\nZuko huffs out another breath of steam. \u201cI don\u2019t want them here, Uncle.\u201d\nIroh claps his hands together. \u201cAlright, then. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to have to ask you three to please leave.\u201d\n\u201cBut,\u201d Aang says.\nIroh hands out little wrapped bags that smell delicious and then bustles them off deck, down the gangplank, and into the marketplace proper, all with a smile and an unflappable grace, like he is escorting them home, not manhandling them away from his nephew.\n\u201cThank you for frequenting the Jasmine Dragon,\u201d Iroh says. \u201cI hope to see you again soon!\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you just kick us out?\u201d Katara asks, dazed.\nAang has already unwrapped his bag. \u201cOh, there\u2019s biscuits in here!\u201d\nWith a wave goodbye and wish for them to have a great day, Iroh disappears back up the gangplank. Customers are quickly shooed off and the gangplank is lifted, and the Jasmine Dragon is streaming out of port less than an hour after the Avatar had stepped foot on deck.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not hungry, Uncle.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps some more tea, then.\u201d\nZuko sighs and nods, allowing Iroh to fill his teacup back up. Although Iroh is worried about Zuko, he\u2019s glad that this has happened now, after he has spent three years gently parenting Zuko. If the Avatar had bounced onto their deck when Zuko was still twisted up from Ozai\u2019s violence, then his nephew would have had a very different reaction.\nThe spirits truly are working in their favour. This is a stroke of fate. He knows it.\nIroh allows silence to settle over the room. He considers strong-arming Zuko into a round of Pai Sho, but decides against it. If Zuko wants to finish his tea, disappear into his bedroom, and immerse himself in theatre scrolls, then Iroh will let him.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to chase after the Avatar,\u201d Zuko says abruptly.\nIroh sips his tea. \u201cI know.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want this to destroy the life we\u2019ve worked so hard to build.\u201d\nAnd Iroh is proud of him for that. He\u2019s glad that Zuko could lay down the wild chase Ozai had sent him on and embrace a more humble life. Zuko learned how to live for himself and not the approval of a man who would never be satisfied.\nBut he has known for some time that this run-down ship and the company of a dozen adults isn\u2019t what Zuko needs.\nIroh lays his hand over Zuko\u2019s. \u201cYou deserve more, nephew.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a testament to their years on the Jasmine Dragon that Zuko doesn\u2019t jerk his hand away. \u201cMore? What else is there? The palace? Uncle, you don\u2019t think we should go back there, do you? My father \u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo, no. Of course not. But beyond this ship. Beyond the war. Don\u2019t you deserve more out of life, Zuko?\u201d\nZuko stares blankly at him. He clearly doesn\u2019t understand what Iroh is saying. He never had regarded himself very highly. Even now, after years in Iroh\u2019s care, he still doesn\u2019t think he deserves any extra kindness the world has to offer.\nZuko isn\u2019t ready for what Iroh has to say.\nIroh puts down his tea. \u201cNever mind, nephew. I heard you purchased another theatre scroll from the markets yesterday. Why don\u2019t you tell me about it?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you saw in that guy,\u201d Sokka fumes. \u201cHe seemed like a real jerk to me!\u201d\n\u201cYou were a jerk to him first,\u201d Katara says.\n\u201cAre you taking the firebender\u2019s side? I thought you were my sister.\u201d\n\u201cStop being so dramatic.\u201d\n\u201cSokka,\u201d Aang whines. \u201cCome on. He\u2019s a firebender. A good firebender! And he\u2019s our age!\u201d\nSokka shoves another biscuit into his mouth. They taste amazing--soft like melting butter, with a kick like cinnamon to them--and that just makes him angrier. \u201cWe should focus on getting to the North Pole.\u201d\n\u201cBut Zuko is right there,\u201d Aang says. \u201cWhen are we going to get another chance like this? Katara?\u201d\nKatara bites her lip. \u201cHe seems like he doesn\u2019t want to be around us though, let alone teach you firebending.\u201d\n\u201cWe have to at least try!\u201d\n\u201cHow?\u201d Sokka asks. \u201cYou saw how he reacted to you. If we go onboard the Jasmine Dragon, his uncle will just smile and carry us off again. Seriously, how is that old man so strong \u2026\u201d\n\u201cI have an idea,\u201d Aang says, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll like it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a warm day. Zuko is standing on deck, soaking in Agni\u2019s rays and tending to the steady stream of customers. It\u2019s the kind of day that soothes his anxieties, reminds him why he enjoys this life so much.\nA shadow falls over the ship, as though a cloud has passed in front of the sun. A few people gasp. Daichi holds up a broom like it\u2019s a weapon. And then Zuko is caught around the waist and hoisted into the air.\nHe thrashes and tries to twist out of the hold, but they dive sharply left, and he\u2019s thrown back against the thing carrying him.\nHe can hear shouting from the ship. The figures on board, waving their arms frantically and trying to call up to him, grow smaller and smaller as he rises into the air. His anger is replaced by fear.\nAnd then he\u2019s dropped into a saddle. The Avatar lands beside him.\n\u201cHi, Zuko,\u201d Aang says, as though he hadn\u2019t just snatched him off the Jasmine Dragon, like a lion-hawk scooping up a baby buffalo-sheep. \u201cWelcome aboard!\u201d\nKatara, on the other side of the saddle, waves awkwardly at him. Sokka just glares.\nZuko scrambles for the edge of the saddle. No one makes a move to stop him. When he peers over the side, he sees why: the ground is a very, very long way down, his ship a dot in the shrunken port. He\u2019s stuck.\n\u201cDid,\u201d Zuko says, \u201cdid you just kidnap me?\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it kidnapping,\u201d Aang says. \u201cMore like very strongly insisted you come with us.\u201d\nZuko stares at the sheepish airbender perched on the head of the sky bison--two beings he had, until very recently, thought were extinct. Then he looks to the Water Tribe siblings, one passingly polite and the other not looking at him. Then he peeks over the edge of the saddle again.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been kidnapped,\u201d Zuko says, staring at the barely visible spot of colour that was the Jasmine Dragon. He feels numb. \u201cBy a child.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not kidnapping!\u201d\n\u201cAang,\u201d Katara says gently, \u201cit\u2019s definitely kidnapping.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re okay with this?\u201d Zuko asks, narrowing his eyes at her.\nShe smiles at him. That sugary-sweet smile reminds him, alarmingly, of Azula.\nZuko sits back down, arms crossed. The rest of the flight passes in uncomfortable silence.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen the sky bison lands in a patchy clearing, Zuko leaps over the edge of the saddle, rolling on impact, and runs for the treeline. Aang zips in front of him.\nZuko ducks and sprints in the other direction. Aang jumps in front of him again.\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t make me fight you,\u201d Aang says, hands up.\nZuko throws a fireball at him. Aang flips into the air easily.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Aang says brightly. \u201cDo you think this counts as a firebending lesson?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Zuko says, aiming his next fireball at Aang\u2019s feet.\nTheir fight can\u2019t even be called a fight. It\u2019s like trying to win against the wind, if the wind had a habit of smiling and complimenting his bending while the wind\u2019s friends looked on, snickering.\nEventually, Zuko resigns himself to waiting them out. He sits on the far side of the campsite, far enough away to avoid conversation, close enough that Aang isn\u2019t tempted to scoot closer to him.\nThis, he thinks, would be easier if the Avatar wasn\u2019t a friendly preteen and over a head shorter than him. This would be easier if Zuko was the kind of Fire Prince Ozai had wanted him to be. He might have gotten away, then. But then, Aang might not have survived the encounter.\nSokka disappears into the trees to scope out the area or collect firewood or take a leak. Zuko doesn\u2019t know. Aang unloads the sky bison and then spends some time patting the beast down. Zuko tries not to stare. Or feel jealous. No matter how soft the sky bison\u2019s fur looks, or how cute those little happy sounds he makes as Aang pets him are.\nKatara is unpacking their food and meager cooking supplies. Zuko settles more firmly against the tree trunk. He likes watching people cook. He spends as much time with Chef as he does with Jee, up in the control room, learning the local topography.\nBut then, Chef always seems to have a much easier time than Katara.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKatara is struggling to light her very sad looking pile of pine-needles and damp wood. She\u2019s a waterbender, she should be able to pull the moisture out of a patch of forest debris, but no matter how much she tries, the pile stays stubbornly damp. And her fire stays stubbornly unlit.\nAang is watching off to the right. He had offered to help earlier, but she had snapped at him and insisted she could do this. But she can\u2019t. And now she\u2019s tempted to just give up and let them all go hungry for the night.\nShe has almost forgotten about their firebending captive until he crouches down beside her, making her jump.\n\u201cHere,\u201d he says, knocking her hands away. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d\nHe rearranges the stack of loose wood and pine-needles so that it is more structured. Then he blows a flame into the centre. It\u2019s the most delicate display of firebending she has ever seen. If she hadn\u2019t been paying attention, she might have thought he was an airbender, blowing on an ember to spark a flame.\nAside from the one-sided fight with Aang when he had tried to escape, he hasn\u2019t attacked them. He is clearly a capable firebender, but there he sits, gently stoking the fire, looking calm and wind-ruffled, an apron still tied around his waist.\nKatara starts preparing dinner. She doesn\u2019t have the time or supplies for anything more than a plain stew. Sokka returns sometime later, glaring weakly at Zuko, and plants himself on the other side of the fire.\nOnce the fire isn\u2019t in danger of going out, Zuko stands and hovers awkwardly in the middle of the camp. Sokka ignores him, but Aang stares intently, like the world\u2019s most powerful guard dog, so Zuko just sighs and sinks back down again.\n\u201cCan I help?\u201d he asks her.\nKatara blinks. \u201cPardon?\u201d\nZuko gestures to the vegetables resting in her lap, and repeats, \u201cCan I help?\u201d\nShe eyes him warily. \u201cCan you even cook?\u201d\n\u201cOf course I can cook,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cEveryone can cook, can\u2019t they?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a teenage boy.\u201d\n\u201cAnd?\u201d\nSokka snickers on the other side of the campfire. He\u2019s sharpening a short tree branch, supposedly to intimidate Zuko.\nKatara points the ladle threateningly at Sokka. \u201cIf you say cooking is women's work, I swear ...\u201d\n\u201cWell, who cooked in the tribe?\u201d Sokka says. \u201cNot the men. We hunt, you cook. It\u2019s just nature, Katara.\u201d\nZuko squints at Sokka. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\u201cThere are roles women do,\u201d Sokka says slowly, like he thinks Zuko is particularly dense, \u201clike cooking and cleaning, and there are things men do, like hunting and protecting.\u201d\nZuko turns to Katara, eyebrows raised. \u201cIs he serious?\u201d\n\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d Katara says, resigned.\n\u201cWomen are more than capable of hunting and fighting,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cIf you spoke like that in the Fire Nation, someone would set you on fire.\u201d\nZuko stares down at the beginnings of dinner. From the increasingly sour expression on his face, Katara can tell Sokka\u2019s words are getting to him. Though if that is because he\u2019s offended or baffled she isn\u2019t sure.\nNo one speaks after that. Zuko silently takes over most of the cooking, and Katara lets him, simply because she isn\u2019t sure how to stop him.\nOnce stew is cooked and served, they settle back down. The sun has begun to set, casting their campsite in shades of pink. The blazing fire keeps them all warm.\nSokka shoves a spoonful of stew into his mouth and moans. \u201cKatara, you\u2019re fired. Zuko, you\u2019re our chef from now on.\u201d\nKatara is too busy eating to be offended. \u201cIt is good. Thank you, Zuko.\u201d\n\u201cGood? It\u2019s brilliant!\u201d\n\u201cGlad you think so,\u201d Zuko says, putting his empty bowl aside, \u201cbecause you\u2019re helping me clean up.\u201d\nSokka squawks but he isn\u2019t fast enough to dive out of the way. Zuko snags him by the back of his shirt and hauls him in the direction of the river.\n\u201cAang, grab the rest of the dishes,\u201d Zuko says.\n\u201cBut--\u201d Aang starts.\n\u201cDishes!\u201d\nAang follows along obediently, arms full of dishes. And suddenly, Katara is alone in front of a roaring fire with only Momo and Appa, the sound of Sokka, Aang and Zuko\u2019s bickering growing quieter.\nShe isn\u2019t sure if she is ready to think about good firebenders, but in that moment, she decides she likes Zuko after all.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNight falls and the Water Tribe siblings curl into their sleeping bags to go to sleep. Aang sits down next to Zuko, ready to take first watch.\nThey might seem like they\u2019re just kids, whining about chores and making jokes at each other\u2019s expense, but Zuko shouldn\u2019t forget that this is the Avatar and his companions. They were successful in snatching him off the deck of his home, after all. They\u2019re smart enough to watch him through the night.\nAnd the Avatar is, it seems, smart enough to cheat at cards.\nZuko squints down at the cards stacked on the forest floor. \u201cYou\u2019re definitely cheating.\u201d\nThe Avatar blinks up at him, all innocent big eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not. How could you say that?\u201d\nAang\u2019s next hand is just as impossibly good as every one of his previous turns has been. Zuko throws his cards at him, stomps to the other side of the campsite, and slouches against the trunk of a tree.\nAcross the campfire, Aang pouts at him. Zuko pointedly ignores him.\nIt takes less than an hour before Aang grows bored and dozes off. Zuko lingers for a few moments to make sure he\u2019s deeply asleep, but the sight of the Avatar--curled in on himself, so small and isolated on the grass, a strange orange-yellow huddle that has no place in the world--unnerves him too much. He gently steps around the sleeping teenagers and slips out of the clearing into the trees, heading towards the nearest port.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nZuko returns to the ship just after midnight. Uncle and Chef are on deck, playing Pai Sho under the stars.\nChef stands up abruptly. Uncle just smiles, far calmer than Chef.\n\u201cNephew,\u201d Uncle says, eyeing Zuko for fresh injuries, \u201chow was your evening out?\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t an \u2018evening out\u2019, Uncle. I was kidnapped by the Avatar and his friends. It was \u2026\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t have the words. He\u2019s still shaken up inside, because he had given the Avatar up as a fool\u2019s errand years ago; because even now that he knows the Avatar is real, returning to the Fire Palace is the last thing he wants to do; because every time he gets close to the war, Zuko feels like his insides have twisted into knots.\nBecause the Avatar had seemed so normal, brushing down Appa and cheating at cards and laughing at Sokka, elbow-deep in the river, scrubbing dishes. Just a kid.\n\u201cA journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step,\u201d Uncle says.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Zuko says.\n\u201cYou need a bath, nephew,\u201d Uncle says. \u201cGo and freshen up. Chef and I will bring you tea and something warm to eat.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nZuko doesn\u2019t like serving customers that are his own age. He doesn\u2019t like the way they talk to him--like how the older women talk to Uncle.\nIt\u2019s almost a relief when the girl who had been fiddling with his sleeve and asking inane questions about his work schedule and restaurant-preferences looks over his shoulder and shrieks. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d\nZuko turns. It\u2019s the sky bison, Appa, descending quickly towards them, the Avatar balanced on his head.\nZuko untangles himself from her grip and dashes back to the samples table. He pulls the tablecloth back and grabs his dao blades.\nAang jumps off Appa and dives onto the deck. Zuko rolls to the side. With an arc of his swords, he sweeps Aang\u2019s feet out from under him and twists him around. Aang pushes up with a burst of air before he can faceplant into the floor.\nAang reaches out, tries to grab the front of his shirt. Zuko catches his wrists between the flat sides of his blades and twists, sending them both tumbling. Zuko rolls. Aang pushes off the ground and backflips over his head, landing directly behind Zuko.\n\u201cLove the swords!\u201d Aang says, before grabbing him around the waist and propelling them both ten feet into the air.\nZuko is dumped into the saddle. He peeks over the edge. If he jumped from this height, he\u2019d break both his legs, if not his back.\nHe sighs and sheathes his blades. When he looks up, the Water Tribe siblings are staring at him, almost the same way the young customer had been looking at him earlier.\n\u201cMarry me,\u201d Sokka says.\n\u201cUm,\u201d Zuko says.\n\u201cThat was really cool!\u201d Aang smiles as if he hadn\u2019t just kidnapped Zuko for the second time that week. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you could fight like that. Why didn\u2019t you just firebend?\u201d\n\u201cIt scares away customers,\u201d Zuko grumbles.\n\u201cAnd swords don\u2019t?\u201d Katara asks. Zuko glares at her.\nSokka inches across the saddle and gently touches the sheathed weapons. Zuko jerks them away.\n\u201cTeach me,\u201d Sokka demands.\n\u201cHey!\u201d Aang says. \u201cYou can\u2019t just pinch my sifu like that. I called dibs on him first.\u201d\n\u201cHe can be your firebending master. I need him to teach me how to use those swords. Did you see that? He was all--\u201d Sokka whips around, approximating Zuko\u2019s fighting style. He wobbles and almost topples over the side of the saddle. Zuko grabs his tunic and yanks him back down.\n\u201cI\u2019m not teaching any of you,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cNot firebending. Not sword-fighting. Nothing.\u201d\n\u201cYou taught Sokka how to be responsible,\u201d Katara says.\n\u201cHe already should be responsible! \u2018Women\u2019s work\u2019? Honestly.\u201d\nSokka crosses his arms and looks away, pouting. Zuko suspects the only reason he isn\u2019t arguing is because he is still holding out hope that Zuko will teach him how to fight with swords.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cZuko?\u201d\nZuko looks up from the dishes. \u201cHm?\u201d\n\u201cWhy did you leave the Fire Nation?\u201d\nZuko stiffens. He doesn\u2019t look at Katara, just stares down at his hands, buried beneath the ice-cold water, going red with the cold.\n\u201cKatara,\u201d Sokka scolds, \u201cdon\u2019t interrogate the guy! He just offered to wash our dishes for us.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m grateful for that,\u201d Katara says. \u201cBut come on, Sokka. Why haven\u2019t we seen any other nice firebenders?\u201d\n\u201cUh, because the Fire Nation is full of evil jerkbenders?\u201d\n\u201cAnd aren\u2019t you the least bit curious about why Zuko is different?\u201d\nSokka drops his voice, though Zuko can still hear him clearly. \u201cIt\u2019s. You know. His scar.\u201d\n\u201cHe can still hear you,\u201d Zuko says loudly. His hands are starting to go numb. He warms them, creating a swarm of bubbles and a hiss of steam beneath the water. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell us,\u201d Aang interjects, jumping off Appa to join them by the river. \u201cKatara, I thought you were coming around to Zuko?\u201d\n\u201cI am,\u201d Katara says, \u201cbut we have to be careful. You\u2019re the world\u2019s last hope, Aang. We have to protect you.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t--\u201d Aang begins.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Sokka says. \u201cShe\u2019s right.\u201d\nZuko drops back on his heels, shaking his hands and warming them, creating another burst of steam. He keeps his eyes on the riverbank beneath him, muddying the knees of his pants, rather than at the others.\n\u201cDo you know what happens to a fire when it gets fed too much fuel? It grows and grows until it gets out of control, and then only a skilled firebender can extinguish it.\u201d\n\u201cIs this a firebending lesson?\u201d Aang asks. \u201cShould I be taking notes?\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not--\u201d Zuko cuts himself off. \u201cI just mean that people can be like that, too. In the Fire Nation, people can become obsessed with lighting fires, especially when they\u2019re young and still learning what it means to hold a flame. It can destroy homes. Entire towns, sometimes. And that fire-hunger can consume a person, just as it can consume everything around them.\u201d\n\u201cOf course there are a bunch of baby arsonists running around the Fire Nation,\u201d Sokka says. He yelps when Katara elbows him in the side. \u201cWhat? It makes sense.\u201d\n\u201cFire-hunger doesn\u2019t just affect kids,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cOr individuals. The Fire Nation has been fed too much violence and fear for too long. It\u2019s become infected with a kind of fire-hunger, a kind that won\u2019t stop until it\u2019s burnt up the rest of the world. That\u2019s why I\u2019m not trying to go back to the Fire Nation. Going back there would be like laying down on the fire pit and letting the flames take me.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a long, ringing silence. Then Sokka says, \u201cSpirits, that\u2019s dark.\u201d\nZuko shoves his hands back into the river. This time, he doesn\u2019t fight the stinging cold. \u201cYeah, I know. \u201c\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nZuko returns to the boat angrier than when he had left. His anger has no direction--he should be furious with Aang, Katara and Sokka, but even he can see that they\u2019re just being pulled along by destiny. Aang didn\u2019t ask to be the Avatar. Katara and Sokka didn\u2019t ask for the war to come down so heavily on their village, for the war to ravage their culture and lives. Zuko didn\u2019t ask to be--\nWhen Jee asks if he wants to join them for dinner, Zuko shouts at him to leave and slams the door in his face, something he hasn\u2019t done since he was thirteen.\nUncle comes to his room shortly after with two bowls and an armful of fresh candles. He chatters on about the Pai Sho games Zuko had missed that afternoon. The crew knew better than to bet against Uncle, so the only thing Uncle had won were bragging rights.\nAfter dinner, they meditate side-by-side using the candles. While Uncle is setting up the candles, stacking them in evenly spaced rows like the servants used to do, he says, almost casually, \u201cYou know, Zuko, a change is as good as a rest.\u201d\n\u201cA proverb? Now, Uncle?\u201d\n\u201cJust something to think about,\u201d Uncle says, soothing down the back of Zuko\u2019s hair, the way Mother used do all those years ago, before returning to his seat on the other side of the table.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe next time a shadow falls over the ship while Zuko is standing on the deck, vulnerable to an aerial assault, he twirls on his heel and shoots a funnel of fire into the air. It\u2019s almost instinctual, at this point.\nAang shrieks and dodges, spinning higher into the air.\n\u201cZuko,\u201d Iroh admonishes from where he is refreshing the samples, \u201cno combative bending around the customers.\u201d\n\u201cSorry, Uncle. I forgot my swords.\u201d\nAang dives for him again. Zuko rolls out of the way, because he knows from experience that once Aang gets his hands on him, it\u2019s all over.\n\u201cStay still,\u201d Aang shouts.\nZuko throws an empty teacup at him, and then another, and then brandishes the empty teapot like a weapon. \u201cBack off.\u201d\n\u201cZuko!\u201d Iroh calls again. \u201cStop destroying the china.\u201d\nAang dives again. Zuko swipes at him with the teapot, feeling half-crazed. His family has a history of questionable mental health, after all. Maybe this will be the thing that makes him snap.\nZuko is so busy concentrating on Aang that he doesn\u2019t notice the Water Tribe siblings. A boomerang hits him on the back of the head, knocking him over. The teapot goes skittering across the deck.\nZuko pushes up onto his knees, ears ringing. Aang grabs him around the waist while he\u2019s still disoriented.\nWhen Zuko\u2019s head stops aching, he finds himself on Appa\u2019s saddle, a frustratingly familiar place. He\u2019s going to start waking up in a cold sweat at night, thinking he\u2019s back here.\nZuko leans over the edge of the saddle. They\u2019re too high up for Zuko to jump, but low enough that he can see Uncle waving up at him.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be at the next town over!\u201d Uncle yells up at him. \u201cHave fun, nephew! Be safe!\u201d\nZuko sighs and waves back. He\u2019ll see Uncle again soon enough, he supposes.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s an uncommonly cold night. Sokka and Katara are already half-inside their sleeping bags. Aang seems unbothered, even dressed in thin cotton as he is. Zuko, however, dressed in his equally thin tunic and apron, isn\u2019t so unaffected.\nZuko eyes the fur-lined sleeping bags the siblings are huddled inside. \u201cYou don\u2019t happen to have a spare, do you?\u201d\n\u201cNope,\u201d Sokka says, smug. \u201cSorry.\u201d\n\u201cDo you want my jacket?\u201d Katara asks.\nZuko shakes his head. \u201cIt\u2019s alright. You keep it.\u201d\nZuko closes his eyes and focuses his energy inward, towards his core, just as Uncle had taught him. He carefully brings his inner flame to a simmer. Warmth spreads through his body. He relaxes, exhaling steam.\nWhen he opens his eyes again, all three teenagers are staring at him.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Zuko says.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen firebending like that before,\u201d Aang says. \u201cCan you teach me?\u201d\nZuko almost says, \u201cSure\u201d before he remembers who he is, who Aang is. \u201cYou\u2019re an airbender,\u201d he says instead. \u201cYou already know how to keep yourself warm.\u201d\nSokka leans into Zuko\u2019s personal space, putting a hand on his unscarred cheek. He makes a content noise in the back of his throat. \u201cYou don\u2019t normally radiate this much heat.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t normally need to,\u201d Zuko says, shoving Sokka away. \u201cIt\u2019s just a way firebenders can keep warm.\u201d\nSokka inches closer, until he\u2019s able to leech off the heat Zuko is emitting like a furnace. It doesn\u2019t take long before Katara is pressing in on his other side.\n\u201cWe have a campfire,\u201d Zuko protests, sitting stiffly between them.\nSokka waves him off. They\u2019re so close that he almost smacks Zuko in the face. \u201cYou\u2019re warmer. And more comfortable.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s cold,\u201d Katara says, even though she\u2019s in a sleeping bag and jacket designed to withstand temperatures at the South Pole.\nIt doesn\u2019t take long for Aang to grow jealous. He throws himself over the smoking embers of their fire and into Zuko\u2019s lap. The force tips them over.\nSprawled out into the dirt, beneath the bony weight of three teenagers, he just sighs and wonders what Uncle is doing. The crew doesn\u2019t look for him when he\u2019s kidnapped by the Avatar, not anymore. Just trusts that he will return home on his own. Is it music night? He hopes he\u2019s missing music night.\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Aang says into Zuko\u2019s chest. \u201cHe is warm.\u201d\nZuko stares up at the sky, heavy with stars. He doesn\u2019t have a downy sleeping bag like Katara and Sokka, and he misses his room on the Jasmine Dragon, and he still sometimes misses the silky softness of his childhood bed, even though he had been too young and spoiled to appreciate the opulence of the palace--but this, laying in the dirt with three laughing kids draped on top of him, is nice in a way he can\u2019t articulate.\nZuko meant to slip away in the night, but he ends up falling asleep and waking at daybreak, still squashed between the three kids.\nHe cooks them breakfast. As soon as Aang volunteers to help Katara with the dishes, Sokka grabs Zuko by the elbow and drags him into a neighbouring clearing.\nSokka shoves a blunt sword into his chest. \u201cOkay, sifu. Teach me.\u201d\nZuko examines the sword. The hilt is rough wood, and the blade is chipped and uneven. He supposes this is another way he\u2019s been spoiled; he\u2019s used to the very best weapons, the very best masters. The sword bought from a coastal Earth Kingdom port on a teenager\u2019s budget is almost laughable.\nZuko grimaces. \u201cDon\u2019t call me sifu. And this sword is terrible.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, you can\u2019t make it work?\u201d\nSokka makes it sound like a dare. Zuko readjusts his hold on the sword, testing its uneven weight, the span of its reach.\n\u201cNo, I can. It just sucks.\u201d\nSokka drops into a low, unsteady stance, matching sword in hand. \u201cThem\u2019s fighting words, tea-boy.\u201d\nZuko stares at him flatly. \u201cTea-boy?\u201d\nSokka lunges at him, sword arched high above his head, and Zuko has to roll out of the way to avoid being beheaded.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSokka is sprawled on the ground, panting heavily. Zuko sits primly beside him, fiddling with the cheap blade. Maybe he could melt it slightly, and then mold the weakened metal into place \u2026\n\u201cIf you hate the Fire Nation so much,\u201d Sokka says, squinting, sweat dripping into his eyes, \u201cthen why don\u2019t you join us and help fight them?\u201d\n\u201cSeriously?\u201d Zuko asks.\n\u201cWe just bonded. I\u2019m allowed to ask intense questions without it seeming like an interrogation.\u201d\nZuko grimaces, tracing lines into the dirt with the sword. \u201cI don\u2019t want to fight. I just want to stay as far away from the war and the Fire Nation as I can, and serve tea in peace.\u201d\n\u201cThe Fire Nation is spreading, though,\u201d Sokka says. \u201cThey\u2019re all around us. So is the war. You can\u2019t stick your head in the sand and pretend it\u2019s not there.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve tried fighting,\u201d Zuko says, without saying who he was fighting, or how, or why. \u201cI tried more than once. It didn\u2019t work. I can\u2019t risk losing everything again.\u201d\nThey sit in silence, Sokka still panting, Zuko curled in on himself. Through the trees, they can hear the sound of splashing as Aang and Katara try to clumsily waterbend through trial-and-error.\nAnd then Sokka sits up, shaking himself, readjusting his grip on his sword. \u201cI feel like I almost beat you that last time. Come on, tea-boy. Let\u2019s go for round two.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe were thinking about sending out a search party,\u201d Daichi says when Zuko returns home, sometime after lunch.\nZuko exchanges his dirty apron for a fresh one and refastens the ribbon in his hair. \u201cNo, you weren\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cNah,\u201d Daichi says, ruffling his hair as he passes, undoing the work Zuko just did. \u201cWe knew you\u2019d come home, sooner or later. Did you have fun at least?\u201d\n\u201cDaichi, I got kidnapped.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a no!\u201d\nZuko grabs a notepad, dodges Daichi\u2019s grabby arms, and goes to welcome a group of customers that just stumbled on board, ignoring Daichi cackling behind him.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe customers have all left. Zuko is packing away the tea sets, gently wrapping them in fabric so they don\u2019t crack on their journey to the next town.\nBy the railings, Uncle is watching the marketplace. Zuko almost forgets he\u2019s there. Then, without warning, Iroh very loudly says, \u201cIt\u2019s so nice here.\u201d\nZuko inspects his favourite dragon-print teapot for chips. \u201cI suppose?\u201d\n\u201cBut I\u2019m sure,\u201d Uncle goes on, voice growing louder, \u201cthat RIVERMOUTH, the town we are GOING TO NEXT, will be just as nice. Yes, RIVERMOUTH is a lovely place.\u201d\nZuko puts the teapot down carefully. \u201cUncle, Rivermouth is a dump.\u201d\nUncle ignores him. \u201cRIVERMOUTH is so quaint. Yes, our NEXT LOCATION, RIVERMOUTH, will be a good change of pace.\u201d\nZuko grimaces and turns to Jee and Daichi, who are busy packing away the tables. \u201cI think Uncle has sunstroke again.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey grab him during a rare afternoon off. Zuko is browsing the markets, looking for a gift for Chef\u2019s upcoming birthday, when the people around him start shouting and running in the opposite direction, and then Zuko is airborne.\nZuko sprawls, eagle-spread, in the saddle, staring at the blue sky above him.\n\u201cHow did you even know I was going to be in Rivermouth?\u201d Zuko wonders. \u201cWe made port barely an hour ago.\u201d\nSokka preens. \u201cWe\u2019re just that good.\u201d\nZuko suspects that the entire universe is conspiring against him.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cHere,\u201d Zuko says, after they had landed and he had made sure everyone helped unpack and cook lunch. He opens up his bag and pulls out the black-sheathed katana.\nJee had called him paranoid for carrying weapons everywhere. Chiyo said it was smart, with a tone that suggested she was surprised that Zuko was capable of self-defence. Uncle had just sipped at his tea, smiling. Saying nothing.\nSokka takes the katana with obvious awe, examining the fine script engraved on the hilt. \u201cI noticed it sticking out of your bag, but I thought \u2026 I mean, you didn\u2019t even try and fight Aang with it.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s for you,\u201d Zuko says.\nSokka stares at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d\nZuko shrugs. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to keep fighting, you\u2019re going to need to defend yourself. You\u2019re skilled with the boomerang, but you need something more close-range, and those swords you bought for us to practice with are going to break the first time you go up against a firebender.\u201d\nSokka is still staring at him. \u201cBut--why? I thought you didn\u2019t want to fight.\u201d\nThey\u2019re all staring at him now. Zuko scowls and starts collecting everyone\u2019s dirty dishes. It\u2019s not his turn to wash up, but he needs something to do right now, just so he can get away from Sokka\u2019s soft, wide-eyed stare.\n\u201cI don\u2019t, but that doesn\u2019t mean I want you to get killed. And I have a job. I have a steady income, and plenty saved up. I don\u2019t spend my money on much.\u201d\nThe odd scroll when a new story catches his eye, and gifts for the crew\u2019s birthday, and trinkets he thinks Uncle will like, but that\u2019s it. He doesn\u2019t work for the money. He works because the Jasmine Dragon makes Uncle happy, and provides them with funds that didn\u2019t come out of the royal stipend, and because he needs something to do with his hands or else he\u2019ll go crazy.\nAnd it had been keeping him up at night. Those faulty swords with uneven blades, the only weapon Sokka had aside from a boomerang. Katara didn\u2019t even know how to waterbend, yet. If they were separated from Aang, then \u2026\n\u201cZuko,\u201d Sokka says, voice low. \u201cThank you.\u201d\nZuko stands up, dishes in hand. \u201cYeah. Whatever. Don\u2019t mention it.\u201d And then he disappears through the trees, dishes in hand, to find the closest river. It isn\u2019t until he\u2019s scrubbed everything clean that he realises he should be focused on escaping and making it back to the Jasmine Dragon, not washing up for his kidnappers.\nHe lays the clean dishes down on a patch of grass, hoping the others will find them when they come looking for him, and then sets out towards Rivermouth.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe next time they grab him, Zuko doesn\u2019t even see them. He\u2019s arguing with Daichi, because the other tea server had let the tea steep for too long. Mid-sentence, Daichi swears and jumps back, and then small hands are wrapping around his waist and Zuko is being hoisted into the air.\nZuko is still holding the teapot. When Aang sets him down in the saddle, he realises just how gentle Aang had been; he hadn\u2019t spilled any of the tea.\nSokka snatches the teapot out of his hands without saying hello, and takes a swig directly from it. \u201cIt\u2019s good even cold.\u201d\nKatara grabs it next, taking a sip before passing it on to Aang.\n\u201cIt is good,\u201d Katara agrees. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you make it for us?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not good. Daichi steeped it for too long,\u201d Zuko says, plucking the teapot out of Sokka\u2019s hands when it circles back to him.\nSokka tries to grab it again, but Zuko rolls to the other side of the saddle and raises one leg, ready to kick Sokka away.\n\u201cIt still tastes amazing,\u201d Sokka says, making grabby-hands for the teapot. \u201cCome on, you live on a tea boat! You\u2019re spoiled.\u201d\nZuko stares at them flatly. He peeks over the edge of the saddle to make sure they are flying above open water and not a town, and then throws the teapot over the side with as much force as he can manage.\nSokka wilts. \u201cIs this because--\u201d\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s because you keep kidnapping me!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cDamnit, Aang,\u201d Sokka says, when Zuko is next dropped into the saddle. \u201cI said to grab him when he was holding tea!\u201d\n\u201cPut him back,\u201d Katara suggests. \u201cWe can try again in an hour.\u201d\n\u201cTwo kidnappings in two days,\u201d Zuko says flatly, \u201cbecause you like our tea.\u201d\nHe almost suggests that they just come to the Jasmine Dragon like regular customers, but it probably isn\u2019t a smart idea to invite his kidnappers onto his ship.\n\u201cIt is very good tea.\u201d Aang looks as though he\u2019s seriously considering letting Zuko go back to his shift on the Jasmine Dragon, just so they can snatch him up later when he has an armful of tea.\nZuko scoops Momo up and muffles a scream into his soft back. Momo doesn\u2019t even seem to mind. He just starts combing through the pockets of Zuko\u2019s apron, looking for food.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe next day, sometime after the lunchtime rush, Uncle pushes a packed lunch and three bags of biscuits into his hands.\n\u201cDo you want me to deliver this to someone, Uncle?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s for you to share,\u201d Iroh says, eyes twinkling.\n\u201cBut my break isn\u2019t for another hour--\u201d The rest of Zuko\u2019s sentence is cut off as he is yanked off the deck and into the sky, and then dropped into Appa\u2019s saddle.\n\u201cHi, Zuko,\u201d Katara says brightly.\nSokka sniffs, peering at the bundle in Zuko\u2019s hands. \u201cWhat\u2019ve you got there?\u201d\nZuko sighs and unwraps the biscuits. \u201cI brought snacks?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nZuko doesn\u2019t realise he\u2019s humming until he looks up from his dinner to see everyone staring at him. He flushes, ducking his head.\n\u201cWhat a lovely melody, nephew,\u201d Uncle says, breaking the awkward silence. \u201cWhere did you learn it?\u201d\nThe tune, lilting and soft like a crooning voice on the wind, had been stuck in his head for days. It had come from Aang. When he sang for others, it was loud, bubbling with laughter, but sometimes, when they were flying for long stretches of time, when Aang was caught up in his own thoughts and didn\u2019t realise he had an audience, he would sing these gentle songs. Delicate and thoughtful, a long-forgotten melody almost lost to time.\nZuko clears his throat, avoiding their eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. I must have picked it up at port.\u201d\nThe crew goes back to their dinners. No one suggests Zuko sing at the next music night, thankfully. No one says anything to him at all. It\u2019s feels like they\u2019re carefully not looking at him, though he catches Daichi\u2019s gaze briefly. His fellow tea server winks at him, before being dragged back into his conversation with Kenzu, their engineer.\nZuko plays with his stew. There\u2019s a lump in his throat, and his face is still flushed, but it\u2019s not a bad feeling. Not at all.\nWhen he looks up again, Uncle is smiling at him.\n\u201cYou\u2019re happier these days, nephew. I\u2019m glad to see it.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Zuko says, and shoves a spoonful of stew into his mouth to hide his smile.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nUncle is playing Pai Sho with a handful of crew members, and Zuko is looking over the Jasmine Dragon\u2019s current course with Jee, mapping the places they\u2019ve been over the past few weeks, where they should dock in the future. It\u2019s just a coincidence that their future route brings them closer to the Northern Water Tribe. This is their normal seasonal route. Really.\nThey all go quiet when a shadow falls over the Jasmine Dragon.\nNo one moves as they\u2019re docked by a warship twice their size. Jee nudges him, and says, \u201cZuko, do you want to check if Chef is--\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Zuko says, ignoring everyone\u2019s eyes on him. \u201cI want to hear what they have to say.\u201d\nIn the past, he\u2019s ducked below deck when they run into warships. He didn\u2019t like the way they addressed him, Prince Zuko, with a curled smirk, full of both respect and scorn. Before, he never cared what message they were relaying.\nHe cares now.\nThe lieutenant unfurls a wanted posted. Aang\u2019s face stares back at him. \u201cThe hunt for the Avatar has been given prime importance. All information regarding the Avatar must be reported directly to Admiral Zhao.\u201d\n\u201cZhao has been promoted?\u201d Uncle says, not even bothering to look up from his game of Pai Sho. \u201cWell, good for him.\u201d\nZuko only vaguely remembers Zhao. He does, however, vividly remember Aang, pleading with Zuko to teach him firebending, the way Azula would plead with him to play soldiers when they were very little. He remembers washing dishes side-by-side. Aang, falling asleep on his shoulder on cold nights. Aang, bright and small and twelve.\n\u201cI have nothing,\u201d Zuko says, eyes on the floor, \u201cto report to Admiral Zhao.\u201d\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind,\u201d Jee says, stepping in front of Zuko, \u201cplease get off our ship.\u201d\n\u201cAdmiral Zhao is not allowing ships in or out of this area.\u201d\n\u201cGet,\u201d Jee says very firmly, \u201coff our ship.\u201d\nWith a final scrutinising glance at Zuko, the soldiers leave. Jee tries to catch him by the shoulder, say something that might be encouraging or scolding, but Zuko shakes him off and disappears below deck, making a beeline for his room.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey\u2019re not his friends.\nAang is the eye of the storm, and Katara and Sokka have sworn to stay by his side, and Zuko should stay far, far away from them.\nBut he remembers empty palace corridors, and the nobles and servants with their faces turned away, carefully not seeing him, and the choked silence after Ozai had burnt a lesson onto his face in front of the entire court.\nHe could pretend not to see, too. It would be easy. It would be safe.\nAt dusk, Uncle brings him dinner.\n\u201cIt\u2019s still early,\u201d Zuko says. They don\u2019t normally eat until well after the sun has set.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Uncle says, \u201cit is.\u201d\nUncle stares at him. Zuko feels like he\u2019s missing something. He looks down at his noodles, feels sick at the idea of eating them, feels worse at the thought of just sitting here in silence.\nIroh heads for the door. Zuko says, \u201cYou\u2019re not staying?\u201d\n\u201cNo, not tonight. A watched pot never boils, after all.\u201d Uncle smile, slipping out the door. \u201cGoodnight, nephew. You should sleep in tomorrow. You deserve it.\u201d\nUncle leaves. Zuko stares at the door for a long moment, and then he gets up and fishes his theatre mask out from under his scrolls.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nZuko wakes up to a hazy forest ceiling and tree roots digging into his back. His head aches. He must have been knocked out.\nHe pushes himself up, and almost topples back down again. He squeezes his eyes shut. When he opens them again, stomach in his mouth and the world still spinning, he sees Aang. He\u2019s curled on a branch high above, like a brightly-coloured bird roosting in the treetops.\n\u201cYou remind me of my friend, Kuzon,\u201d Aang says. \u201cIf we met in different circumstances, do you think we would be friends?\u201d\nI thought we already were, Zuko doesn\u2019t say.\n\u201cAll this time,\u201d Aang goes on, \u201cyou\u2019ve been so against joining us. I thought you were scared. I would understand that. I\u2019m afraid a lot of the time, too. Air Nomads don\u2019t believe in violence, but this is war, and I\u2019m the Avatar, and everyone seems to expect me to use violence to fix things.\n\u201cBut you\u2019re good at fighting and you don\u2019t shy away from violence. You know how terrible the war is, but you don\u2019t do anything about it. Why is that?\u201d Aang looks down at him. Even sitting so high above him, huddled in on himself, Aang\u2019s stare pierces right through him. \u201cWhat are you so afraid of, Zuko?\u201d\n\u201cI told you,\u201d Zuko says, voice hoarse. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be involved in the war. I tried that once, a long time ago. It didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d\n\u201cBut you wouldn\u2019t be alone.\u201d The pleading tone is back. Zuko is almost glad; the coldness in Aang\u2019s voice had frightened him. \u201cYou would have me, and Katara, and Sokka. You wouldn\u2019t even have to fight the Fire Nation much! You\u2019d just have to teach me firebending.\u201d\n\u201cAnd paint a giant target on my back.\u201d\n\u201cZuko,\u201d Aang begins.\n\u201cNo!\u201d That sour fear helps Zuko push himself to his feet. He paces around the forest floor. \u201cI just want to live with Uncle, selling tea and living far away from the war. Why does it have to me? Why can\u2019t you find some other firebender to teach you?\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Aang says. \u201cI know it\u2019s supposed to be you. I don\u2019t know why, but--there\u2019s something deep inside me that keeps gravitating towards you.\u201d\nZuko picks his mask up. He wants to hide his face. His scar. He wants to go home.\n\u201cI\u2019m not who you think I am, Aang.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t keep chasing after you,\u201d Aang says. \u201cI can\u2019t keep wasting time.\u201d\n\nWasting time.\n\nZuko puts the mask on. When he turns on his heels and disappears through the trees without looking back, Aang doesn\u2019t stop him.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA shadow falls over the Jasmine Dragon. Zuko calmly puts down the teapot and steps onto the railing. Aang picks him up and carries him to Appa\u2019s back.\nThe siblings don\u2019t smile at him in welcome. Behind the reins, Aang looks like he did that night, perched in the trees, too small and too bright to be real.\n\u201cAang told us that you saved him,\u201d Katara begins.\n\u201cThank you, by the way,\u201d Aang says. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I ever said that, but I was really scared and alone and then you saved me so \u2026 thank you.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t thank me,\u201d Zuko says.\nKatara frowns at him. \u201cYou broke into a heavily guarded Fire Nation fortress, risking both your life and your identity, to save Aang\u2019s life. Why?\u201d\nZuko hunches against the saddle, hands wrapped around his ankles. He can\u2019t explain it to her. He barely understands it himself. Every time he tries to rationalise it in his mind, his thoughts tip sideways, like waves churned up in a storm.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want the Fire Nation to kill Aang.\u201d\n\u201cThey weren\u2019t going to kill me.\u201d Aang sounds small. He sounds twelve. \u201cThey said they were going to keep me chained up for the rest of my life. Not alive enough to escape, but not ill enough to die and be reborn.\u201d\nThat would be hell for any person. But for an airbender, that lonely, sedentary existence would be--unimaginable.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want them to do that, either,\u201d Zuko says, even though he knows it\u2019s not that easy. \u201cThat\u2019s why I rescued you.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been trying to capture him this entire time,\u201d Katara says, eyes blazing. She hasn\u2019t thought of him as the enemy in weeks, but he feels like he\u2019s starting from the beginning all over again. He hadn\u2019t realised her patience was a finite thing. \u201cThey\u2019re going to keep trying to capture him and they won\u2019t stop. And we can\u2019t run from them forever.\u201d\n\u201cFighting in the war and helping an innocent kid are two very different things.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Sokka says, not sounding angry like Katara, just sounding tired. Older. \u201cIt\u2019s not. Not when it\u2019s Aang. You know that. It\u2019s why you refused to teach him firebending, right?\u201d\nZuko throws his hands up. \u201cI saved Aang! Why are you all so upset at me?\u201d\nKatara\u2019s anger cracks. Her next breath is a sob, and she puts a hand over her mouth to stifle it. \u201cHe could have died. He could have disappeared forever and we might never have seen him again. We wouldn\u2019t have even realised what had happened to him. And that could happen again. Zhao is still out there.\u201d\n\u201cWe can\u2019t keep wasting time,\u201d Sokka says, flat, all emotion stamped out of his voice. \u201cAre you going to help Aang? We need to know.\u201d\nZuko thinks about taking off his apron and flying away from the Jasmine dragon; of spending months hiding from the Fire Nation without knowing if he would ever return to Uncle; of Father finding out what he\u2019s done and sending Azula to bring him back to the palace so he can teach him another life lesson.\nIt\u2019s hard to breath, suddenly.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Zuko chokes out, throat closing off. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d\nHe won\u2019t give up the Jasmine Dragon. He won\u2019t abandon Uncle. They\u2019ll have to find another firebender.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Sokka says. \u201cOkay.\u201d\nAnd that\u2019s it.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe festival reminds them of Zuko. They smell the Jasmine Dragon in the foreign spices and smoke in the air. They hear Zuko in the music, something slow and jazzy Zuko had hummed when tending to their campfire.\nBut it isn\u2019t the same. The smoke isn\u2019t undercut with the salty ocean breeze. The music is too perfect, the singer a clear-voiced young woman, rather than one of Zuko\u2019s throaty, wavering tunes. The not-quite familiarity only makes Aang miss Zuko more.\nThey don\u2019t spend long there, though. Soon enough, Aang messes up and they\u2019re rescued by an ex-Fire Nation soldier.\n\u201cJeong Jeong was a Fire Nation general,\u201d Chey says, the campfire casting his face in shadows. \u201cHe\u2019s the only person to leave the army and live. I\u2019m the second, but you don\u2019t get to be a legend for that.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Sokka says, shrugging, \u201cwe\u2019ve met Fire Nation deserters before. They\u2019re okay people. Bit touchy sometimes, but great at cooking.\u201d\nChey falters. \u201cBut you can\u2019t have. People don\u2019t just leave the Fire Nation. Well--they do. I did. But most people don\u2019t. They can\u2019t.\u201d\nSokka shrugs again. \u201cWell, everyone on the Jasmine Dragon did.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe you\u2019ve heard of them?\u201d Katara says.\n\u201cYeah! There\u2019s our friend, Zuko \u2026\u201d Aang trails off, all his energy leaving him at once. \u201cI want him to be my friend, anyway. I wanted him to teach me how to firebend, but he\u2019s been super reluctant to have anything to do with the war. Is everyone who left the Fire Nation that scared of their own people?\u201d\nChey stares at them, mouth open. \u201cDid you say Zuko?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, do you know him? He was travelling with his Uncle Iroh. They run a tea shop.\u201d\n\u201cA tea shop,\u201d Chey echoes, strangled.\nSokka points sternly at Aang. \u201cWe\u2019re heading to the Northern Water Tribe in the morning. We don\u2019t have time to moon over any firebenders. Including this Jeong Jeong guy.\u201d\n\u201cWe gave Zuko a chance,\u201d Katara agrees. \u201cFor weeks and weeks. We can\u2019t do that again. We have to keep moving.\u201d\nAang\u2019s shoulders slump. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right.\u201d\n\u201cBut wait,\u201d Chey says, hands up. \u201cWait. Zuko? As in--Zuko?\u201d\n\u201cYes, the tea server Zuko,\u201d Sokka says. \u201cDoes everyone know him? The Jasmine Dragon really does get around, huh?\u201d\n\u201cBut,\u201d Chey says, looking as though he\u2019s been struck around the face. \u201cTea server? You\u2019re sure?\u201d\n\u201cBest in the world,\u201d Sokka says, and then stands, stretching. \u201cCome on, guys. We need to head out before someone wanders out of town and stumbles upon Appa. The Northern Water Tribe waits for no man!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s music night, but Zuko isn\u2019t playing the tsungi horn, even though Daichi had tried to pester him into it. If Uncle hadn\u2019t kept sighing about missing him at dinner and being so alone on such a big ship (even though he talks with the crew more regularly than Zuko), he would still be secluded in his room.\nIroh\u2019s singing is low and soothing. Zuko\u2019s eyes drift to the stars. There are no clouds tonight, though he keeps expecting to see a dark figure moving through the sky, blotting out the stars as it barrels towards the Jasmine Dragon, a determined Avatar balanced on his head.\nBut there\u2019s no sign of Appa. He hasn\u2019t seen any of them in over a week, since they scooped him up just to yell at him.\nOne song ends and the next begins. The four seasons. One of Iroh\u2019s favourites.\nHe could fall asleep here, surrounded by the soft humming of the crew. He almost always dozed off during music nights when he was younger.\nHis eyes slip close. And then, Jee says, \u201cShip approaching.\u201d\nZuko jerks upright. Across the black water, advancing quickly, is a Fire Nation warship. Taller and sleeker and more powerful than the Jasmine Dragon.\nNo one moves, but the music stops. The silence rings right through him.\n\u201cWe\u2019re docked. There\u2019s no way we can avoid it,\u201d Jee says. Then, he turns to Zuko. \u201cYou should get inside.\u201d\nIt\u2019s what Zuko would have done a month ago, what he\u2019s been doing for years. But now, the idea of slipping below deck, sitting in his room while everyone deals with whatever problem is sailing towards them ...\n\u201cNo,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cI won\u2019t leave you to deal with this alone.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your responsibility,\u201d Jee says. \u201cI\u2019m the Captain. Your Uncle and I can deal with whoever is on that ship just fine.\u201d\nZuko doesn\u2019t want it to be his responsibility. When he had only been on the Jasmine Dragon, it had been easy to bury himself in tea and theatre scrolls and music nights. When he only saw customers, who treated him like an anonymous tea server, or the crew, who treated him like a little brother, or Uncle, who just wanted him to be happy.\nBut then he had been scooped up by a twelve year old Avatar and a pair of Water Tribe siblings, so far from their homes, just like him. Kids burning up with passion. Who knew exactly what had to be done and didn\u2019t shy away from it.\nZuko pulls his loose hair up into a high ponytail. Not a topknot, but Fire Nation enough.\n\u201cWe meet whoever it is head on,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cI have no reason to hide. I\u2019m not doing anything wrong.\u201d\nJee looks like he wants to argue, but then Iroh says, \u201cStay by my side, nephew.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cAdmiral Zhao,\u201d Iroh says, \u201cwelcome aboard! You\u2019re just in time for music night. Come, join us.\u201d\nZhao\u2019s lip curls. The crew all pretend not to notice his disdain or the threat of the armoured soldiers at his back. Chef is still lightly strumming the banjo. But Zuko sits, stiff and very obvious, beside Iroh.\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I have more pressing matters to deal with,\u201d Zhao says. \u201cNot that I would expect you to concern yourself with such things, Prince Iroh. You look very busy.\u201d\nIroh smiles through the insult. \u201cNot as busy as you, it seems. What brings you aboard our ship on such a fine evening?\u201d\nZhao waves a lazy hand, and a soldier unfurls an official order. His brother\u2019s signature is a full stop at the bottom of the scroll.\n\u201cUnder Fire Lord Ozai\u2019s authority, I am seizing your crew. We\u2019re launching an invasion against the Northern Water Tribe, where we will finally defeat them and capture the Avatar in one fell swoop.\u201d He eyes Zuko, then. Iroh\u2019s smile gets a little more brittle, though he doesn\u2019t let the tension show. Don\u2019t tip your hand, don\u2019t let them know how deeply you care. \u201cSince no one else has been chasing after him. Tell me, Prince Zuko, did you forget your father\u2019s orders, or did you already give up?\u201d\nLowly, Zuko says, \u201cI didn\u2019t forget.\u201d\n\u201cHm,\u201d Zhao says. \u201cWell, I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s too late. After this week, I\u2019ll have the Avatar. You\u2019ve already made do in the Earth Kingdom for three years. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be able to make a life there easily.\u201d\nSome of the crew look like they\u2019re going to start throwing punches soon, so Iroh interjects, \u201cI\u2019m afraid you came here for no reason. The crew are here of their own volition. They were discharged from the military three years ago. They\u2019re under my employment as private hires. You can\u2019t recruit civilians now, can you?\u201d\n\u201cDischarged,\u201d Zhao repeats through his teeth. \u201cAnd you have the paperwork for this?\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d Iroh nods to Jee, who heads to the control room to find the appropriate paperwork. Technically, Jee is not the Captain of this vessel. The Jasmine Dragon is legally a shop, not a warship, and so requires no Captain; but they all know their duties onboard, regardless.\nIn the silence of Jee\u2019s departure, Zuko says, \u201cHow are you planning on capturing the Avatar, Admiral? The last I heard the Avatar was rescued from your stronghold by a spirit.\u201d\nZhao looks sharply at Zuko. Don\u2019t tip your hand, Iroh thinks at his nephew.\n\u201cAnd how do you know this?\u201d\nZuko shrugs. \u201cWord travels fast, especially at ports.\u201d\nZhao scowls, glare still fixed on Zuko. Iroh cannot help but wonder what he has heard about him. What Ozai might have told Zhao about him.\n\u201cNevermind that. I am accruing an armada to attack the Northern Water Tribe head-on. They won\u2019t stand a chance.\u201d\nZuko blinks up at Zhao, as innocent and politely curious as he is with the wealthy customers who tip well. \u201cAnd the spirits? What if one rescues the Avatar again? The Avatar is the bridge between worlds. He could summon one to his aid again.\u201d\nZhao\u2019s smile is sudden and twisted-up. \u201cI\u2019m going to deal with the spirits ahead of time. The Water Tribe are stupid enough to have spirits in a physical form right in the middle of their city--or so my sources say. As soon as we break through the walls, it\u2019ll be simple to kill them and leave the waterbenders defenceless.\u201d\nIroh\u2019s placid court-face slips. \u201cYou can\u2019t. Spirits don\u2019t work that way. The Fire Nation needs them to keep the balance of the world, just as the Water Tribe does.\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t concern you,\u201d Zhao says. \u201cJust keep running your tea shop, Prince Iroh.\u201d\nJee comes back with the papers, then. Zhao looks them over with a deepening scowl. It takes everything Iroh has not to strike down the man where he stands, before he can sail out to the Northern Water Tribe and do irreparable damage to the world.\nZuko puts a hand on his elbow, just out of view of Zhao\u2019s scowl. His nephew looks at him, something especially bright in his eyes. The Avatar is there, Iroh remembers. Zuko\u2019s friends.\nDon\u2019t tip your hand, Zuko\u2019s eyes say. Iroh has taught him well.\nZhao shoves the papers at Jee. \u201cSo this isn\u2019t classified as a military vessel, anymore. A tea shop. Really, Prince Iroh? You would let your nephew pull you down to his level?\u201d\n\u201cWill that be all?\u201d Zuko asks in the even, professional voice he uses on customers.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Zhao says, casting a last scathing look at the Jasmine Dragon. \u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d\nZuko smiles, and it doesn\u2019t reach his eyes. \u201cThank you for stopping by. We hope to see you again soon. Have a great day.\u201d\n\u201cYou should reconsider this farce, Prince Iroh,\u201d Zhao says. \u201cDon\u2019t forget what I said in my letters. My offer to join me still stands, if you change your mind.\u201d\nZhao barges past Jee and heads back to his own ship. Zuko\u2019s polite smile stays fixed to his face until the ship has begun to sail away. Iroh thinks, yet again, that the Jasmine Dragon has taught his nephew how to be a good ruler more efficiently than Ozai ever did. If Zuko can deal with Zhao like that, he can deal with any number of nobles with dead-end ideas and backward insults.\nOnce the ship is shrinking in the distance, Iroh puts a hand on Zuko\u2019s shoulder.\n\u201cAre you alright, nephew?\u201d\nZuko\u2019s hands clench into fists. He\u2019s still staring at Zhao\u2019s warship, disappearing into the black night, off to collect more souls before he makes the journey to the Northern Water Tribe.\n\u201cI have an idea,\u201d Zuko says, \u201cbut I\u2019m worried you\u2019re going to stop me.\u201d\nIroh is worried about the opposite; that he will give in to his nephew\u2019s plan, because Zuko is sixteen years old and looks happier as a tea server than he ever did as a prince.\nBut because the war is plummeting into a death spin, and the Avatar is twelve years old and needs the right people by his side, and Zuko needs to embrace his royal birthright--because Zhao just confessed to a plot to kill spirits, Iroh just smiles, and says, \u201cTell me how I can help.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m worried,\u201d Jee says.\n\u201cI\u2019m almost an adult.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Jee says, \u201cyou\u2019re not. I don\u2019t think a man can understand how young he is until he gets old.\u201d\n\u201cYou sound like Uncle,\u201d Zuko accuses.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why Iroh isn\u2019t stopping you from doing this,\u201d Jee says, pacing angrily up and down the kitchen, \u201cbut I know someone has to. You\u2019re getting very close to something you said you wanted no part in when you abandoned your mission.\u201d\nZuko looks down at his soup. \u201cI know.\u201d\n\u201cThen why? You said you wanted a quiet life away from the war.\u201d\n\u201cI do,\u201d Zuko says, and that\u2019s the truth. \u201cBut ...\u201d\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t decided to regain your honour again, have you?\u201d Chef asks, already busy cleaning the rice for their breakfast. \u201cBecause your father had no idea of your worth. You shouldn\u2019t listen to anything he ever said--\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that.\u201d\nZuko stirs his soup, trying to find the right words for the too-big feeling unfurling in his chest. Chef doesn\u2019t scold him for playing with his food. That, more than anything, tells Zuko how serious this is.\n\u201cPeople always say,\u201d he begins, \u201cSomeone should do something. They\u2019ve been saying it for years, now. I\u2019ve been saying it, too. Everytime I see another ruined village or hear about people who have lost loved ones to the war, I think someone should do something about that. But if we\u2019ve all been saying it, then nothing is actually getting done, is it?\n\u201cI think the world expects that \u2018someone\u2019 to be Aang. But he\u2019s twelve. And if the whole world sits back and watches a kid flounder under everyone\u2019s expectations, then they\u2019re only making everything worse. They\u2019re a part of the problem.\u201d\n\u201cZuko,\u201d Jee says.\n\u201cAnd besides, we\u2019ve been in the Earth Kingdom for over three years, now. These people--I feel close to them in a way I never thought I would. Responsible, almost. I know I don\u2019t owe anyone anything, and I don\u2019t want to go back to the Fire Nation, or join any sort of rebellion, or leave Uncle, but ...\u201d Zuko stops. Pulls on his hair, still tied up in a ponytail. \u201cBut I can\u2019t just sit back and watch bad things happen. Not when it\u2019s the Fire Nation in the wrong.\n\u201cAnd if I can do something, even if it\u2019s just something small like this \u2026 then I have to, don\u2019t I?\u201d\nThe kitchen swells with silence. Zuko pushes his soup away. His stomach is too tied up to eat, even if Chef might nag him.\nBut when he looks up, Chef and Jee are just staring at him. Zuko can\u2019t read their expressions.\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to forget sometimes, but ...\u201d Chef begins.\nJee nods. \u201cHe really is royalty.\u201d\nZuko jerks out of his seat, scowling. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not. Not anymore. I\u2019m not doing this to go back to the Fire Nation. I\u2019m just--I\u2019m going to go help my friends, and then I\u2019m coming right back here again.\u201d\n\u201cFriends,\u201d Jee says to Chef.\n\u201cHe\u2019s finally growing up,\u201d Chef says, and they both laugh when Zuko, red-faced, starts shouting at them.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI must apologise about my lack of manners the other night,\u201d Iroh says, pouring two cups of tea. A standard, bland blend. Iroh will not waste good tea on this man. \u201cIt has been so long since I was at court.\u201d\nZhao doesn\u2019t quite manage to hide his smirk behind his teacup. \u201cA man of your caliber is squandered on that ship, Prince Iroh.\u201d\nIroh sighs. \u201cYes, you made me realise that last night.\u201d\n\u201cSo have you reconsidered my offer?\u201d\nIroh sips at his tea, pretending to gather his thoughts. He struggles not to grimace--both at the taste and at his words. \u201cYes, I accept. It will be an honour to serve as your general.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what of your nephew?\u201d Zhao says. \u201cUnfortunately, an untrained boy like Prince Zuko has no place on my ship.\u201d\nThat untrained boy already has made his way onto Zhao\u2019s ship. That boy who looked so pale and grim, dressed in an adult\u2019s armour so he can sneak into a city under siege. Iroh\u2019s heart hurts for him, even if he\u2019s so unbelievably proud.\n\u201cHe\u2019s sixteen, he needs to learn how to live on his own,\u201d Iroh says. \u201cThe Jasmine Dragon has sailed into warmer waters. The crew will keep an eye on him.\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Zhao says, almost gently. \u201cIt is better for him to be out of the way. Safer. I\u2019m sure the crew will take good care of him.\u201d\nHe\u2019ll have to send a messenger hawk off to Jee, to remind them to keep someone on constant-guard for assassins. There is no prince onboard to target, but that doesn\u2019t mean the rest of the crew won\u2019t be hurt if Zhao sends someone after them.\n\u201cFor now, though.\u201d Iroh lifts his teacup into the air. \u201cTo the Fire Nation.\u201d\nZhao holds his tea up. \u201cTo victory!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re going into the lion\u2019s den, nephew,\u201d Uncle says, slipping through the door silently. \u201cYou can\u2019t be caught by anyone other than a friend.\u201d\n\u201cI know that,\u201d Zuko snaps. \u201cDon\u2019t you think I know that?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Zuko turns, then. He had grown used to seeing Uncle in comfortable green and browns. Seeing him in a red cloak fine enough for a retired General is strange. Uncle looks so stiff and washed out. And scared. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Uncle. You just wanted to sell tea and live peacefully, and now, because of me, you\u2019ve been dragged back into the war.\u201d\nUncle cups his face. Zuko can\u2019t help but lean into it, eyes falling shut.\n\u201cAll I wanted was to live happily with you, Zuko. I never wanted your father to stop you from living your own life. But now you\u2019re standing up for what you believe in, you\u2019re making strong friends, you\u2019re carving out a path for yourself--and I couldn\u2019t be prouder.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be involved in the war,\u201d Zuko admits, voice small, \u201cbut I don\u2019t want my friends to be hurt either. And \u2026 and I want the war to end.\u201d\nZuko closes his eyes, enjoying the simple warmth of Uncle\u2019s touch, the safety he felt next to him.\n\u201cI need to help the Avatar, don\u2019t I?\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to do anything, my nephew. This is your life. Only you can choose how to live it.\u201d\n\u201cI thought I had already chosen,\u201d Zuko says.\n\u201cWe get more than one chance to make decisions in life.\u201d\nZuko draws back with a sigh. \u201cRight.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for nagging you. I only worry. Ever since I lost my son ...\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say it.\u201d\n\u201cI think of you as my own.\u201d\nZuko shudders and leans his full weight into Uncle, who envelops him into a tight hug. They stand there, holding on to each other, all of their unsaid words tangible in the air.\nZuko forces himself to pull away. \u201cWe\u2019ll meet again, Uncle.\u201d\nHe climbs into the rowboat and begins to lower himself down to the dark ocean.\n\u201cRemember your breath of fire,\u201d Uncle says quickly, leaning over the edge to watch his descent. \u201cIt could save your life out there.\u201d\n\u201cI will.\u201d\n\u201cAnd put your hood up! Keep your ears warm.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Zuko calls up to him.\nThe rowboat lands with a soft splash. Zuko picks up the oars and steadies himself, pushes his thoughts away from the warm safety of his uncle and onto the dangerous journey ahead of him.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn a stroke of rare luck, Zuko finds a pack of seal-turtles diving through a tunnel in the ice. He follows them into the near-black ocean. The water is cold enough to burn. Even with his inner fire simmering in his chest, his limbs go numb. He swims as far as he can manage, comes up for air, and then forces himself to continue on.\nHe finally reaches the city. It\u2019s bigger and grander than he was expecting--not because he still believes the lies he was told as a child about the Fire Nation\u2019s superiority, but because he has never been around so much snow. Who knew you could do so much with it?\nHow is he supposed to find Aang, Katara and Sokka in such a large city, hyper-vigilant with the Fire Nation at their gates? He\u2019ll be spotted. And killed.\nThe thought slides out of his head a moment later. He doesn\u2019t think much of anything, after that. His feet lead him through empty streets, winding further and further up, until he comes to a round wooden door.\nHe climbs inside and almost chokes on the warm air. An island of grass and vegetation surrounds a koi pond. Seated by the water is a white-haired teenager he doesn\u2019t recognise, Katara, and a faintly-glowing Aang.\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be fine so long as we don\u2019t move his body,\u201d Katara tells the other girl. \u201cThat\u2019s his way over to the spirit world.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe we should get some help?\u201d\nKatara smiles. \u201cNo. He\u2019s my friend. I\u2019m perfectly capable of protecting him.\u201d\n\u201cThe anmarda will be gunning for him specifically,\u201d Zuko says loudly. The girls whirl around. \u201cKatara, I know you\u2019re upset with me, but please, you don\u2019t know what Zhao is capable of. We have to get Aang somewhere safe.\u201d\nThe other girl looks ready to bolt for the door. The Jasmine Dragon has been driven out of port by mobs, before. But here, there\u2019s nowhere to go. No crew at his back. And he doubts he would survive any mob formed in the middle of the Northern Water Tribe.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Katara says, hand out, almost as though she\u2019s ready to grab the girl if she runs. \u201cHe\u2019s my friend, too. Yue, this is Zuko. Zuko, this is Princess Yue.\u201d\nZuko bows, lower than he would if he was still a prince. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for frightening you. I know a firebender is the last thing you want to see right now, but I come with news.\u201d\nYue doesn\u2019t come any closer, but she also doesn\u2019t run off and alert the guards. That\u2019s alright. Zuko wasn\u2019t expecting a warm reception. Not everyone is as stupidly friendly as Aang, Katara, and Sokka.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re here to warn us that the Fire Nation is planning an attack,\u201d Katara says dryly, \u201cthen you\u2019re a little too late.\u201d\nZuko glances around the oasis. It\u2019s so open, so undefended. It would be ravaged by the Fire Nation, another casualty in this siege.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cIt\u2019s worse than that. It\u2019s Zhao--he\u2019s planning on killing the spirits.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to believe us,\u201d Sokka points out.\nThey\u2019re gathered in a circle on the grass, where they can still see Aang\u2019s eerily glowing form. When Yue had left to fetch him, Zuko had half-expected Sokka to storm through the wooden door with his katana drawn.\nBut instead, Sokka had barrelled into the oasis and swept Zuko into a hug.\n\u201cThey\u2019ll believe us,\u201d Katara says. \u201cIt\u2019s Zuko they won\u2019t believe.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, they\u2019ll probably drown him.\u201d\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Zuko says.\nSokka shrugs. \u201cWhat do you want me to tell you, buddy? Not everyone understands the nuances of the world like we do.\u201d\n\u201cThis coming from the guy that wanted to fight me the second he realised the Jasmine Dragon was run by firebenders.\u201d\n\u201cPeople change!\u201d\nZuko smiles. He can\u2019t help it. He\u2019s in the middle of the Northern Water Tribe while it\u2019s under siege, after years of staying as far away from active combat as he could--and yet he\u2019s happier than he has been in weeks. Even though his body is still frozen through, his breath of life and the warm oasis air the only things keeping hypothermia from setting in. Even though a strange princess is sitting across from him, staring at him as though he\u2019s a foreign species.\nHe had missed his friends. Their easy banter. The way they effortlessly made him feel included, like he belonged. He missed them.\nHe just wants them to be safe.\nWhen he starts thinking that they should just grab Aang and make a run for it before Zhao gets the jump on them, Aang jerks awakes with a shout. \u201cZuko!\u201d\nAang stumbles to his feet and spins around to face them. Katara tackles him in a hug. He leans into her embrace, smiling over her shoulder at them. \u201cHi there, Zuko.\u201d\nBut Aang hadn\u2019t been facing him when he said his name. Could he hear them in the spirit world?\nSokka must have had the same thought. \u201cHow did you \u2026?\u201d\nAang shrugs. \u201cJust had a feeling Zuko would be here.\u201d\nSokka and Zuko exchange baffled glances.\n\u201cSpirit magic gives me a headache,\u201d Sokka says.\nZuko shakes his head. They don\u2019t have time for this. \u201cAang, Zhao is coming to kill the spirits. Spirit. I don\u2019t know, but--we have to stop him.\u201d\nAang blanches, looking back at the calm pond. \u201cHe can\u2019t do that. It\u2019ll throw the entire world out of balance.\u201d\n\u201cUncle tried to tell him that, but he didn\u2019t listen. He only cares about furthering the might of the Fire Nation.\u201d Zuko can\u2019t keep the bitterness out of his voice. Maybe the years at sea, surrounded by war-affected Earth Kingdom natives, has skewed his perception of his homeland.\nWhen Zuko looks across the grass, he finds Yue staring back at him.\n\u201cYou\u2019re far from home,\u201d she says softly. \u201cDon\u2019t you miss the Fire Nation?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Zuko pauses. The grass under his knees blurs. He can almost hear the sound of turtleducks splashing in the royal pond, feel the sweet humidity of the air. \u201cYes. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\nMaybe Zuko does still love his country, his patriotism buried deep beneath the old fear, but he does not love the people that lead it. He does not love what fire hunger has done to them.\n\u201cYou\u2019re conflicted.\u201d\n\u201cI loved my home and my people, but I didn\u2019t love the way they made me feel or the pain I was forced to bear because of duty.\u201d\nYue keeps starting at him with her unnaturally blue eyes. \u201cI understand. I love my people, but sometimes, I think ....\u201d\nYue looks away, towards Sokka, and startles when she finds them all staring at her and Zuko. She reflexively straightens and smoothes out her skirt. Zuko would blush if his blood was circulating normally.\n\u201cSorry to interrupt this, uh, weird bonding,\u201d Sokka says awkwardly, \u201cbut we were just wondering how to move the spirit-fish.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to alert the Chief to Zhao\u2019s plans?\u201d Zuko asks.\nAang shakes his head. \u201cIt would slow us down, and I\u2019m the Avatar. It\u2019s my responsibility to protect the spirit world.\u201d\nZuko stands up, his legs aching, and examines the koi caught in an endless loop. \u201cDo you have a bowl? Or, uh. A bucket?\u201d\nNot the most sacred of containers, but as long as the spirits were safe, did they care about how dignified their rescue was?\n\u201cNo,\u201d Katara says, climbing to her feet, \u201cbut you do have a waterbender.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey climb onto Appa with the koi fish suspended above them, still swimming in perfect circles inside Katara\u2019s bubble.\nZuko tries to convince them to fly as far away from the invading fleet as they can, but Yue refuses. She won\u2019t leave her people to die at the Fire Nation\u2019s hands while she escapes to safety.\n\u201cYou won\u2019t have any people left if Zhao gets his hand on the spirits,\u201d Zuko snaps, but Yue sits tall and unflinching under his stare. \u201cYou\u2019re being stupid about this.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m a princess,\u201d Yue says simply. \u201cI won\u2019t run from my people.\u201d\nThe rest of them are benders or experienced warriors. Yue can\u2019t do anything against the Fire Nation--and yet she\u2019ll stand against it. She won\u2019t run away and save herself.\n\u201cThe Fire Nation will kill you,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cThey\u2019d enjoy it, too.\u201d\n\u201cZuko,\u201d Sokka snaps.\nYue holds up a hand. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Sokka. He\u2019s just as stressed as we are.\u201d\nSokka backs down, but keeps his glare aimed at Zuko.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just my sense of duty,\u201d Yue continues. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but I get this feeling that we have to stay close. Inside the city limits, at least. It\u2019s like something deep inside me just \u2026 knows.\u201d\n\u201cMe, too,\u201d Aang says.\n\u201cLike your body is leading you forward even though your mind doesn\u2019t know why or where?\u201d Zuko says.\nYue nods. \u201cExactly like that. Do you feel it, too?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but I felt something similar earlier, when I was looking for Aang. I didn\u2019t know where you all were or how to navigate the city, but somehow, I found the oasis almost immediately.\u201d\nSokka throws his hands into the air. \u201cGreat, more spooky magic! Am I the only one that hasn\u2019t had a weird spiritual experience? Katara?\u201d\n\u201cI have no idea what they\u2019re talking about,\u201d Katara says, \u201cbut I trust them. We\u2019ll stay somewhere nearby.\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d Sokka says, \u201cbut we\u2019re going somewhere defensible. Or at least somewhere where Zhao won\u2019t be able to corner us.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHovering at the top of her city, beneath the rays of the full moon, Yue witnesses the true violence of the Fire Nation. She sees the dark stain of their tanks against the snow and the fury of their fire, great bursts that push her people back and decimate their buildings.\nIt lights a vast anger inside her. An alien emotion. There\u2019s something else waking up inside her, rising like a sea-beast swimming slowly towards the surface, its body so great that it disturbs the ocean around it.\nThis is wrong, Yue thinks, as she watches the Fire Nation break through their inner walls.\nThis is wrong. As she hears her people\u2019s screams, the smell of soot overwhelming the familiar brine of her home.\nThis is wrong. As the sun sets and the firebender\u2019s attacks glow brighter in the falling darkness.\nThis can\u2019t happen. As Zhao begins the trek towards them on rhino-back, a pack of soldiers behind him, ready to help him bring down the sky bison.\n\nThis can\u2019t be allowed to happen.\n\nZuko shifts beside her. When she looks at him, she sees her fear reflected back at her. He\u2019s a firebender, but even he\u2019s frightened of the Fire Nation.\nIt would frighten her too, if her people had become so lost. Would she do something to stop them, like Zuko is?\nBut then, she has always felt voiceless. Her people are peaceful, but sometimes their decisions aren\u2019t always right, and she feels more like an object that belongs to them than a person born to protect them. Even now, she has been relegated to the side, forced to watch her city fall.\n\nThis is wrong.\n\nThey are her people, and she has always been their\u2019s, and no outsiders can come and hurt them.\n\u201cUh, guys?\u201d Sokka asks. \u201cOne of the spirit-fish is glowing.\u201d\nYue doesn\u2019t look away from the city, sprawled beneath them.\n\u201cAang, did you do that?\u201d Katara asks.\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. It is a full moon, though. Does the moon spirit always glow during full moons?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Sokka touches Yue\u2019s shoulder. She doesn\u2019t move. \u201cYue? Yue--hey, what\u2019s wrong with your eyes?\u201d\nYue stands. They are a very long way up, but the distance feels like nothing to her. She is used to hanging suspended above the ground.\n\u201cSokka, don\u2019t touch her,\u201d Aang warns.\n\u201cBut this isn\u2019t normal! She shouldn\u2019t glow, she\u2019s not the Avatar. Yue, sit back down. We can fix this. We can help you.\u201d\nYue\u2019s friends sound as though they are a great distance away. She manages to pull away, breach through the surface of her mind, long enough to say, \u201cI have to protect my people, Sokka. This is what I was born to do. I won\u2019t sit by idly ever again.\u201d\nYue steps onto the edge of Appa\u2019s saddle. Her friends shout at her, but she has already slipped beneath the veil of power again. She has become them and they do not waste time on mortals\u2019 words.\nHands tear at the back of their dress, try to pull them away from the edge, but they do not move. Cannot be moved by anyone else\u2019s will.\nYue steps into the open air. They do not fall. They float, and all at once they are more complete and more full of rage than they have ever been.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey watch from the safety of Appa\u2019s saddle as Yue hovers above her city. Except--it\u2019s not Yue. Not entirely. Not just her.\nHer skirt has taken on a strange sheen, like wet ice glowing under moonlight. She is haloed in light. Her hair seems longer, wilder, caught in the wind, even though the night air is exceptionally still.\nSokka\u2019s face has cracked open. He hangs over the edge of the saddle, hands outstretched. Katara holds onto the back of his shirt in case he does something stupid like jump after her.\nThe fighting below them slows. Waterbenders and firebenders stop and stare, mesmerized at the woman suspended above them. The Water Tribe falls to their knees in worship. Some firebenders crumple too, in fear or sheer disbelief. Yue passes by these people without a second glance.\nBut to the firebenders that do not kneel, she sweeps a hand through the air. The fabric of reality splinters open at her command, and those left standing are brought down, spasming in pain. Alive, but in that moment, wishing for death.\nSome run. Some stay, frozen. Those that stand and try and fight, those that keep lashing fire against the melting hide of her city--those, Yue kills.\nZhao stares up at her, unmoving and defiant, still clasping the knife he would have used to kill the moon spirit. With a flick of her wrist, Yue separates his soul from his body, and his corpse lands with a thump in the snow.\nWhen she reaches the outer wall, she doesn\u2019t need to keep fighting. She stands, a protector, the last barrier between the fleet and the Northern Water Tribe, and waits. The ocean rises up to help her sister and pushes the ships further out. The ships don\u2019t try to fight.\nOr rather--that\u2019s not quite true. Soldiers scramble on deck, but they can\u2019t launch an attack at her. Their capataults will not light. Their fists will not spark. The Moon Spirit is the sister of Agni, a being made in his reflection. Firebenders rely on the refracted sunlight beaming off the moon, just as everyone else does. And he will not let them raise a hand to her.\nShe waits, as the foot-soldiers scramble out of the city and into rowboats. As they sail quickly out to their warships. When the soldiers have either fled or been killed, she calls to her sister. The ocean surges up once more and the ships are pushed far away from the Water Tribe in a great wave.\nWhen they are gone, the Moon Spirit recedes, leaving only Yue, the girl, to collapse back onto the snow.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey land Appa near the outer-wall. Sokka almost breaks his ankle jumping off the saddle and onto unstable snow, but he doesn\u2019t pause, just sprints until he\u2019s by Yue\u2019s side.\nAang and Katara stay on top of Appa, bracketing Zuko. He shivers between them, stupidly grateful for the warmth and the silent protection they offer.\nChief Arnook and a healer are bent over Yue. Sokka speaks quickly with them. Then sags.\nHe cups his hands to his mouth, and calls, \u201cShe\u2019s okay.\u201d\nKatara sighs with relief. Aang looks like he\u2019s going to start crying.\n\u201cThat should\u2019ve been me,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m the Avatar. It\u2019s my job to protect people and deal with spirits.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do everything yourself,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cYou\u2019re a kid, Aang. You\u2019re a person. You need to let people help you, okay?\u201d\nKatara knocks her feet against Zuko\u2019s. \u201cWhat a change of heart you\u2019ve had, Zuko. You were fighting us for so long and then suddenly we leave you alone, and you come running after us?\u201d\nZuko is too cold to blush, but he ducks his head, anyway. \u201cI was worried about you. If you hadn\u2019t known what Zhao was planning, the Fire Nation would\u2019ve killed the spirits, and then what would the world have done?\u201d\n\u201cThank you, Zuko,\u201d Aang says.\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cReally. Please stop mentioning it.\u201d\nSokka is talking very quickly with the chief. They can\u2019t hear what he\u2019s saying, but they keep looking back at them. The Fire Nation threat might have been dealt with, but there\u2019s still a very real possibility that Zuko is going to get shoved down an icy ravine.\n\u201cI\u2019ll vouch for you,\u201d Aang says, standing. \u201cKatara--\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll stay on guard duty,\u201d Katara says, patting Zuko\u2019s arm.\nAfter a lot of quick talking and several promises that Zuko stays with the Avatar and friends at all times, they don\u2019t throw him into the black ocean or lock him in a cell. Zuko makes sure to stick close to his friends, anyway.\nKatara leads them back to the little room they\u2019ve been staying in. Sokka trails along behind them, still in shock.\nInside, they start piling furs into the middle of the room. When Katara shoves him into the middle of the nest, Zuko goes. He\u2019s quiet as they pile in around him, pushing in as close as they can.\n\u201cWhy did you come?\u201d Sokka asks, breaking the silence. He\u2019s got an arm slung over Katara, his hand grasping Zuko\u2019s jacket.\n\u201cI heard what Zhao was planning and I--\u201d Zuko swallows, closing his eyes. Aang presses in a little closer, his nose digging into Zuko\u2019s ribs. \u201cI couldn\u2019t let that happen. I couldn\u2019t just bury my head in the sand, the way I\u2019ve been doing for three years.\u201d\nSokka huffs. \u201cTook you long enough.\u201d\n\u201cWelcome to the family, Sifu Zuko,\u201d Aang says.\nZuko closes his eyes, his throat tight and burning, and says, \u201cThanks for having me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn the morning, they visit Yue. His friends crowd around the door, but Zuko hangs back. Aside from Uncle and King Bumi, Yue was the first royal he had spoken to in three years. She was his age, and so determined to help her people that she had given herself to the moon spirit without knowing if she would ever come back.\nHe doesn\u2019t know her, though. Not the way Katara and Aang and Sokka know her. But she rattles him.\nBut then a healer slips out of Yue\u2019s room and says, \u201cShe wants to speak with the firebender.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Zuko says.\n\u201cPrincess Yue wants to speak to you alone,\u201d says the healer again. \u201cDon\u2019t keep her waiting.\u201d\nYue\u2019s bedroom is three times as large as the room they\u2019d stayed in last night, with a roaring fire keeping it comfortably warm. Under a mound of furs, Yue looks fragile and wane. Though, if Zuko squints, he can still see a faint flicker of unnatural light in her eyes, as though she were lit from within.\nHe bows and settles by her bedside, trying not to fidget. \u201cHow are you?\u201d he asks awkwardly.\n\u201cI\u2019m well,\u201d she says. \u201cThe healers say I just need to rest. Spirit encounters drain a lot of energy.\u201d\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t just an encounter.\u201d\nShe smiles, a quick acknowledgement of her power, and then asks, \u201cAnd how are you? It mustn\u2019t be easy being in the North Pole. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve found both the temperature and the people rather cold.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t come here expecting to be comfortable. I came here to help my friends.\u201d\n\u201cNot many people would do the same.\u201d She pauses, studying him carefully. \u201cI heard that Master Pakku vouched for you, too. I hadn\u2019t realised you were acquainted.\u201d\nZuko blinks. \u201cI\u2019ve met plenty of people from the Southern Water Tribe--but not the Northern one.\u201d\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t explain how he knew you, but Master Pakku is a highly respected waterbender, so my father took his word for it.\u201d Yue keeps staring at him with those too-bright eyes. \u201cSomething tells me you\u2019re not just an ordinary firebender, though.\u201d\nZuko stiffens. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\nYue hums, looking away. \u201cWell, you\u2019ve inspired me. You came here to stand up for what you believed in, not what your people said was right. I decided to do the same.\n\u201cI spoke with my father this morning and I stood up for what I believed in. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s just humouring me right now, while I\u2019m so drained and he\u2019s so shaken from what occurred, but I think he listened. And even if he didn\u2019t, I\u2019m not going to back down.\u201d\nZuko furrows his eyebrows. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cIn the Northern Water Tribe, women don\u2019t have much power. I was in an arranged marriage before everything happened. My husband would have been chief. But I won\u2019t sit quietly as people speak for me. Not anymore.\n\u201cIt helps that people saw that I can turn into the moon spirit, I suppose. They\u2019re not going to underestimate me again.\u201d\n\u201cBe careful,\u201d Zuko says, a lump in his throat. \u201cI stood up to my father, too. More than once. It didn\u2019t end well.\u201d\nYue\u2019s eyes flick to his scar. Zuko nods, and she claps a hand over her mouth.\nThe words come tumbling out. \u201cI spent years trying to change his mind about me. It wasn\u2019t until I realised that I would never be the son he wanted, that I didn\u2019t want to be the kind of person he would be proud of, that I was finally happy.\u201d\nZuko tugs on his braid. After everything that has happened, his ribbon has managed to survive.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like talking about it,\u201d Zuko goes on, \u201cbut if you\u2019re going to stand up against the traditions of your people, you should know. It can be dangerous.\u201d\n\u201cThank you for telling me, but my father is the chief. He\u2019s a good man. I\u2019m sure he wouldn\u2019t--\u201d\nZuko\u2019s mouth feels glued shut. He unsticks his tongue, and says, \u201cMy father is the Fire Lord.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Yue says.\n\u201cI thought he wouldn\u2019t do anything either, until--until he did. The last time I stood up to my father, I was banished.\u201d\nYue sits up, furs falling into her lap, and pulls Zuko into a tight hug. When she draws away, her eyes are wet. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry that happened to you, Prince Zuko. I hope the Avatar defeats the Fire Lord so you can go home safely.\u201d\n\u201cI already have a home,\u201d Zuko says, \u201cand it\u2019s not the Fire Palace.\u201d\nHe feels more tired than he has felt in a long while, even after a full night\u2019s sleep sandwiched between his friends. Suddenly, he desperately misses Iroh and his humble, warm bedroom and the kitchen, manned by Chef, who was always there to listen and scold him for being stupid and coax his secrets out of him with cinnamon biscuits.\nHe\u2019s never been away from the Jasmine Dragon for longer than a few days before. The idea of leaving with the Avatar, never knowing when he\u2019ll see Uncle again, when he can let his guard down and relax--it burns him right through.\nHe needs to see Uncle.\n\u201cZuko?\u201d Yue prompts, gentle. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d\nZuko has run out of words. He nods tightly, and she takes his hand. Her fingers are small and soft between his. It\u2019s strange to think that this is the hand that stopped a battle the night before.\n\u201cYou\u2019re okay, now,\u201d she says, and there\u2019s something especially soothing about her voice. He believes every word she says. The Water Tribe is crazy if they can\u2019t see that she would make an amazing leader. \u201cYou were so brave, coming to help us. You saved a lot of people\u2019s lives. You might have saved the entire world--if the Fire Nation had taken the spirits and the Avatar, the war might have been lost.\u201d Yue squeezes his hand. \u201cI suppose I should call you Prince Zuko, though, shouldn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not a prince,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cNot anymore. And my friends don\u2019t know yet. I\u2019m not ready for them to know.\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t tell them.\u201d\nHe laughs, and it sounds wet and weak. \u201cThanks, Yue. You\u2019ll make an amazing leader someday.\u201d\nYue ducks her head. He thinks, for a moment, that he\u2019s upset her, but when she looks back up again, she\u2019s smiling, shy but proud, and the light in her eyes is even brighter. \u201cI will make a great chief,\u201d she says, voice strong. \u201cAnd you will, too.\u201d\nThe smile drops off Zuko\u2019s face. \u201cWhat? No. No.\u201d\n\u201cWhen the war is over, you must get in contact with us. We need to create some kind of trade agreement between our nations. The Northern Water Tribe has been too isolated for too long.\u201d\n\u201cYue,\u201d Zuko hisses, \u201cI was banished, remember? I\u2019ll never be--I don\u2019t want to be--\u201d\n\u201cI thought the same thing, before yesterday.\u201d She drops his hand, shooting him one last wane smile, before gesturing for the door. \u201cCan you send Sokka in, please? I need to speak with him.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThat afternoon, Appa is packed with fresh supplies. Yue is strong enough to meet them out on the courtyard, standing tall by her father\u2019s side.\nMaster Pakku is there, too. Katara and Aang\u2019s waterbending teacher. The man who vouched for him.\n\u201cI\u2019ve decided to go to the South Pole,\u201d Pakku says to Katara. \u201cSome other benders and healers want to join me. It\u2019s time we helped rebuild our sister tribe.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about Aang?\u201d Katara says. \u201cHe still needs to learn waterbending.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Pakku says, \u201cthen he better get used to calling you Master Katara.\u201d\nKatara smiles, bright and proud, and Zuko remembers the girl who practiced for hours by the river, lifting wobbly water-bubbles into the air, tripping over her own clumsy stances but getting back up again, every time. He\u2019s proud of her, too. He can\u2019t wait to spar with her.\n\u201cAang has two masters, now,\u201d Katara says, nudging Zuko.\nZuko rolls his eyes. \u201cWait until he starts calling you \u2018Sifu Katara\u2019 every other day, then we\u2019ll see if you\u2019re still smiling about it.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve decided to become the Avatar\u2019s firebending master, then?\u201d Pakku asks, eyeing Zuko.\nZuko looks away. \u201cI guess so.\u201d\n\u201cThere is no guess,\u201d Pakku says sharply. \u201cThere is only do or do not.\u201d\nPakku sounds like Uncle--if Uncle didn\u2019t care for tea and fine foods, and was far stricter. Zuko purses his lips together. \u201cPrincess Yue says you vouched for me last night. Why is that? We\u2019ve never met before today.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve had tea with your uncle before,\u201d Pakku says, as if it\u2019s that simple. \u201cHe\u2019s a wonderful Pai Sho player.\u201d\n\u201cYour family really does know everybody,\u201d Katara says, laughing.\nZuko winces. \u201cYou have no idea.\u201d\nAfter a final round of goodbyes, they climb onto Appa. Aside from the night before, in the middle of the siege, Zuko thinks this is the first time he has willingly climbed onto Appa.\n\u201cSokka,\u201d Katara says quietly, \u201cwhat about Yue?\u201d\nSokka takes a deep, pained breath. \u201cMy place is with you and Aang and Zuko,\u201d he says, subdued. \u201cAnd her place is here. That\u2019s all.\u201d\nZuko doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019s ready to throw himself into life as Aang\u2019s firebending teacher immediately. He needs to see Uncle, and sleep in his own futon, and spend an afternoon serving tea and reading theatre scrolls, just to get the image of the ravaged city and red corpses lying in the snow out of his head.\nBut--he feels like he could join them. Like he will. Like every single frustrating time they kidnapped him was just a lead up to the inevitable.\nAppa takes off with a jolt. The Arctic winds burn their eyes, and they huddle together at the back of the saddle, Zuko pressed between Katara and Sokka, breathing wisps of steam, keeping them all warm.\nThey fly until they see green land--and then they keep flying.\nAgni\u2019s touch grows stronger and sweeter the longer they fly, but Zuko still feels strangely unmoored, his stomach in knots. This feeling\u2013it reminds him of sailing out of Fire Nation waters for the first time, knowing he may never return.\n\u201cWe should land soon,\u201d Aang says.\nZuko curls up tighter in his borrowed parka, huddled between Katara and Sokka. \u201cWe need to keep going.\u201d\nAang frowns. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in the air all day. It\u2019ll be good to rest.\u201d\n\u201cWe can rest when we\u2019re safe.\u201d\n\u201cZuko,\u201d Katara says.\nZuko shoves away from the siblings and crawls to the other side of the saddle, suddenly feeling claustrophobic. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. The Fire Nation would have seen me during the siege. They\u2019d know that I\u2026\u201d He swallows hard. \u201cWhat about Uncle? What if they got caught up in the attack and they need help? What if\u2013\u201d\n\u201cZuko,\u201d Kata says again, softer this time.\nZuko exhales. He concentrates on heating the air between his palms. There\u2019s no pot between his hands, but the act of boiling tea, of pretending to boil tea, calms him. He imagines water bubbling away, the aroma of tea leaves, the murmur of customers out on the sun-baked deck.\nSlowly, the black sea retreats from his lungs and it becomes easier to breathe.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll keep going,\u201d Aang decides.\nZuko lowers his still-warm hands. \u201cThank you.\u201d\nNo one speaks after Zuko\u2019s outbursts, but when Katara and Sokka wriggle over to his side of the saddle, he opens his arms and lets them huddle close.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Jasmine Dragon is hard to spot in the near-dusk, docked in a small, unpopulated bay. Zuko\u2019s eyesight has been half-ruined ever since the Agni Kai. He never would have found it. But just before sunset, Appa makes a low and hungry moan and tips to the left.\n\u201cYou and me both, dude,\u201d Sokka mumbles against Zuko\u2019s arm.\n\u201cI think he can smell something,\u201d Aang says. He pauses, and then he and Zuko both blurt: \u201cTea leaves!\u201d\nAang lets Appa steer them towards the Jasmine Dragon on scent alone. They land in the middle of the deck to the excited shouts of the crew.\nZuko throws himself up and over the saddle, landing with a roll. He sprints across the deck. The crew try to grab at him, yank him into a hug, but Zuko dodges and keeps running.\nHe crashes into Iroh and almost sends them both tumbling overboard.\nUncle latches onto the back of Zuko\u2019s parka and holds him tight. Zuko presses his face into Uncle\u2019s shoulder, hiding his own tears and taking in the smell of smoke and jasmine.\nThey hold each other for a long moment before Uncle finds the breath to ask: \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\u201cI think I met the moon spirit.\u201d Uncle pulls back to look at Zuko\u2019s face. Zuko shrugs back at him. \u201cThe moon spirit possessed the princess. It was\u2026 kind of a blur.\u201d\nUncle laughs. \u201cYou never do things by halves, nephew. I\u2019m just glad you came back to me.\u201d\n\u201cAlways, Uncle.\u201d\n\u201cAnd your friends?\u201d Uncle asks, peering over Zuko\u2019s shoulder. \u201cAre the young kidnappers well?\u201d\n\u201cHi, Uncle!\u201d Aang calls. \u201cCan we get some more red bean buns? And maybe some green tea?\u201d Appa bellows and nudges Aang with his nose. \u201cOh, and I think Appa would like some treats too, if you have them.\u201d\nZuko stares balefully at Uncle. \u201cYou\u2019ve fed my kidnappers bison?\u201d\n\u201cI have no idea what you mean, nephew,\u201d Uncle says to Zuko, and then very obviously winks at Aang.\nIroh bustles below deck to make tea. Chef pulls Zuko in a hug, sweeping him clear off his feet, and then insists they all sit while he makes them a warm meal.\nWhile they eat, Sokka talks about their plans to fly deeper into Earth Kingdom territory in search of Aang\u2019s earthbending teacher. As Sokka speaks, the black ocean rises up and over Zuko\u2019s head again. He hunches over his tea, sucking in the smell of jasmine, and tries to ride it out.\nEvery time Zuko thinks the waves are retreating, he remembers that he will have to leave the Jasmine Dragon again and the sucking tide pulls him back under again.\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Zuko manages, interrupting Sokka.\nThe conversation stops. All eyes are on him, even Chef\u2019s. Zuko focuses on the scorches and stains on the benchtop. Many of them were left by Zuko\u2019s first disastrous attempts at cooking as a half-blind Fire Prince.\nZuko scratches at a scorch-mark with his thumb, not looking at his friends. \u201cI\u2019m staying on the Jasmine Dragon.\u201d\nThe kitchen swells with silence. Aang is frozen with honeyed pear halfway to his mouth. Honey drips onto his tunic.\nKatara stands abruptly, chair screeching. She looks like she\u2019s going to water-whip him. Aang fumbles for her sleeve but she shrugs him off.\n\u201cYou snuck into the Northern Water Tribe when it was under siege to warn us about Zhao,\u201d Katara says through her teeth. \u201cYou\u2019re involved now, Zuko. You can\u2019t keep pretending the war isn\u2019t happening after\u2013\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying! I don\u2019t want to stay behind permanently. It\u2019s just\u2013 I\u2019m not ready to leave the Jasmine Dragon. And I doubt having a firebender tagging along when you\u2019re trekking through the Earth Kingdom and interviewing earthbenders will be all that helpful.\u201d\nKatara makes a face and opens her mouth, ready to argue with him. Iroh cuts her off. \u201cMy nephew has a point. It will be good for you to learn the elements in order, young Avatar. You already have air, and now a tentative grip on water. Next, you will learn earthbending, and then you can come back for my nephew. He\u2019ll teach you the final element.\u201d\nHis friends exchange unsure looks. Zuko purses his lips, if only to contain the apology bubbling up his throat. This has been so much, and Zuko\u2019s heart is only so strong, and he wants to stay with his uncle for as long as he possibly can.\n\u201cThe next time you kidnap me,\u201d Zuko says, \u201cI won\u2019t fight it. I just need more time to say goodbye.\u201d\nSokka strokes his chin. \u201cHm, it would be fun to kidnap you again.\u201d\nAang perks up. \u201cBut you will teach me firebending? After I start learning earthbending?\u201d\nZuko steps away from Uncle and bows. Not the bow of a Fire Prince. The bow of a tea server.\n\u201cAvatar Aang,\u201d he says in the formal cadence he hasn\u2019t used since he was at court, \u201cI promise that I will be your fire-master when you return to me.\u201d\nAang throws himself over the benchtop and drags Zuko into a twirling hug. \u201cSifu Hotman!\u201d he cries, and Zuko wonders, not for the first time, what exactly he\u2019s gotten himself into.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey wave down at the Jasmine Dragon until the small figures on deck, waving back at them, are too small to be seen. They keep staring at the small dot that is the Jasmine Dragon until it disappears into the horizon.\n\u201cI know he was only with us properly for a few days,\u201d Katara says, \u201cbut it feels weird not having him here.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to miss him,\u201d Aang says.\nSokka groans, throwing his head back. \u201cWhy did we let our cook and portable heat-pack stay behind? Aang, turn around. We need to go and kidnap him again.\u201d\n\u201cWe agreed we were going to wait until I found an earthbending teacher first.\u201d\n\u201cBut it\u2019s cold up here without Zuko!\u201d\nKatara smacks him over the head. \u201cYou\u2019re going to miss him just as much as we are. Admit it.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll miss his cooking. Now Aang and I have to go back to eating your mush\u2013\u201d Katara dives for him. Sokka shrieks and scrambles away. \u201cI also miss having someone normal around.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m normal,\u201d Aang says.\n\u201cNo, Aang,\u201d Katara says, managing to sound gentle even as she hooks an elbow around Sokka\u2019s neck and starts to choke him out, \u201cyou\u2019re really not.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nZuko stares up at the cloudless sky. Appa has long since melted into the distance, but he can\u2019t bring himself to move.\nUncle gives him some time to sulk, and then comes and presses an apron into his hands. Zuko shoves down his hurt, his uncertainty, his strange sense of longing, and gets back to work.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAang pivots on his heel, attempting to find Katara and Sokka through the twisting trees. A flash of crimson makes him freeze. He fights his way through the soupy marsh and finds himself in an open clearing.\nIn the middle of the clearing, perfectly serene, sits his fire-bending master.\nAang approaches hesitantly. \u201cZuko?\u201d\nZuko doesn\u2019t look up at him. The skirts of his robe are haloed around him in a near-perfect circle. The robes are fine crimson silk with gold embroidery, far nicer than anything Zuko has worn before. More expensive than a tea server could afford.\nZuko has always seemed afraid of the Fire Nation. Whenever they mention it, his breathing quickens and he shrinks in on himself, as though trying to make himself smaller. And yet this Zuko, wearing crimson robes and a gold five-pronged hairpiece, holding a beautiful teapot between his palms, looks utterly peaceful.\nA girl\u2019s laughter rings through the trees. Aang whirls around. Another apparition\u2013a young girl with milk-white eyes\u2013flits through the trees and calls him away from the ethereal sight in the clearing.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cFirst a tea server that wants nothing to do with us,\u201d Sokka says, \u201cand now a blind noble that wants nothing to do with us. You really know how to pick your bending masters, huh, Aang?\u201d\n\u201cDoes it have to be her?\u201d Katara asks. \u201cThere are plenty of benders in the Earth Kingdom. Can\u2019t we just find someone else?\u201d\nAang shakes his head. \u201cIt has to be her. I saw her in the forest.\u201d\n\u201cWell, you might need to think of more options,\u201d Sokka says, \u201cbecause she might not come with us.\u201d\n\u201cWe could kidnap her,\u201d Aang suggests. \u201cIt worked with Zuko.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a moment of silence as they contemplate that.\n\u201cSomething tells me that Toph wouldn\u2019t go along with it like Zuko did,\u201d Katara says eventually.\nAang wilts. \u201cYou\u2019re probably right.\u201d\nSokka pats him on the shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, buddy. We can always kidnap Zuko next time we see him.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s easy to forget that Toph, who clicked with the group as easily as Zuko had, had never actually met Zuko.\nAt dinner, Sokka had remarked, off-hand, that he missed Zuko\u2019s cooking. Katara had snapped back that she missed having someone around who didn\u2019t take her for granted and actually pulled their weight. Sokka took offense, because he had been \u201cbeen doing plenty around here and following Zuko\u2019s lead\u201d, which made Toph slam down her bowl of lukewarm soup.\n\u201cAlright,\u201d she says, \u201csomeone needs to tell me who this Zuko guy is.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s my firebending teacher,\u201d Aang says from where he had been hovering on the fringes of the sibling\u2019s argument.\n\u201cOh, yeah? Then where is he?\u201d\nSokka winces. \u201cHe\u2019s\u2026 still working through his issues. We\u2019re going to kidnap him once Aang has the earthbending basics down.\u201d\nToph perks up. \u201cKidnap him?\u201d\n\u201cWell, he gave us permission this time.\u201d\n\u201cThis time? You guys have been going around kidnapping people?\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d Aang says quickly. \u201cOnly Zuko.\u201d\nToph cackles and throws her arms into the air, spilling some ofher soup onto Sokka. \u201cAnd here I was thinking you guys were boring!\u201d\nAang winces and tries to defend himself. \u201cHe was the first good firebender I had met since before the war, and something told me he needed to be my teacher. Just like with you.\u201d\n\u201cPlus,\u201d Sokka cuts in, \u201che cooks like an absolute champion. And he lives on a floating tea shop, so he\u2019s literally a professional at brewing tea.\u201d\nKatara nods. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t complain about chores. And he appreciates women.\u201d\n\u201cI value women!\u201d Katara\u2019s soup twists in its bowl, like a snake considering striking, and Sokka quickly adds, \u201cNow I do. I\u2019ve gotten better. I have!\u201d\n\u201cSo, wait,\u201d Toph says, before the siblings can start bickering again, \u201cis this guy your firebending teacher? Because he sounds more likely to take out a restraining order on you all, not join you.\u201d\n\u201cHe only wanted to press charges at the beginning,\u201d Katara says, like that makes that any better. Toph wonders if, had she turned down their offer to run away with them, they would have kidnapped her. Probably not. Toph would have kicked their asses if they\u2019d tried.\u201cBut he warmed up to us,\u201d Sokka says, and then laughs. \u201cGet it, warmed up to us? Because he\u2019s a firebender?\u201d He holds up a hand for Aang to high-five, which he does, but probably just out of pity.\nKatara ignores him. \u201cHe joined us in the Northern Water Tribe, even though he knew it was under siege by the Fire Nation. He might still be hesitant to join us full-time, but it\u2019s not an easy thing to fight against your own people.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to go pick him up soon,\u201d Sokka says. \u201cNow that we have you. Hey, Aang, you have all three of your bending teachers!\u201d\nAang and Sokka do a little dance around the fire, with Aang wearing Momo like a chittering hat, and Katara laughs. They all seem happier talking about this strange firebender than they have in days.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nZuko spends the weeks after the siege at the North Pole slowly saying goodbye to the Jasmine Dragon.\nHe thinks he loves the repurposed warship with its rusted edges and cramped rooms more than he ever loved the Fire Palace. When he was thirteen years old and still feverish with pain, he thought this ship was his own personal hell, something he simply had to withstand before he could win back his honour. Now, the Jasmine Dragon is his home.\nHe spends time with each of the crew. He willingly helps out in the laundry room and the engine rooms more than he ever has before, and ignores the ribbing that earns him. He spends his evenings bent over Earth Kingdom maps, reacquainting himself with the inland geography, rather than just the ports. And when his eyes are dry and his heart is pounding, he slips into the kitchens and finds Chef. If he was going to get underfoot, Chef used to say when Zuko was thirteen and lured to the kitchens by the smell of cinnamon, then he might as well learn something useful.\nThe meals that Chef cooks now\u2013that, Zuko realises, he\u2019s been cooking since Zuko was first kidnapped by Aang\u2013have been simple. Easy. Something filling any hungry teenager could make with simple, cost-effective ingredients and a campfire.\nHe spends more time with Uncle, too.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to miss the Jasmine Dragon,\u201d Zuko admits one evening, tea steeping between his heated palms. \u201cI\u2019m going to miss\u2026\u201d\nUncle reaches across the table to grasp Zuko\u2019s wrist, squeezing it gently. \u201cFrom what I have heard of your friends, you will be in good company. I will miss you dearly, but I take comfort in the knowledge that you will have them to keep you steady and remind you to eat.\u201d\nZuko huffs, blowing his fringe out of his eyes. \u201cI do more cooking than the rest of them!\u201d\n\u201cWould you cook as often and as well for yourself, as you do for your friends?\u201d Uncle laughs at Zuko\u2019s expression. \u201cThey are good for you, nephew. And we will always be here to welcome you home. After.\u201d\nZuko tries not to dwell over what stands between his friends and after.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA shadow falls over the Jasmine Dragon. Zuko whirls around, wielding his broom like a sword, his fight or flight instinct kicking in before his conscious mind has even recognised the danger.\n\u201cOh, so soon?\u201d Iroh asks. \u201cBut music night is tonight!\u201d\nAppa is flying low above them. Aang is behind the reins. Sokka and Katara wave at him from over the side of the saddle. An unfamiliar blot of green sits behind them, hovering at Aang to fly lower.\nIroh disappears below deck while the rest of the crew says goodbye to Zuko.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll miss your Tsungi Horn playing,\u201d Daichi tells him solemnly. \u201cIf you see your dad, kick him in the nuts for us.\u201d\nZuko splutters. \u201cWhat?\u201d\nAppa loops around the ship. He only stops when he\u2019s almost on top of them. Aang\u2019s newly acquired earthbender, who looks even smaller than Aang himself, hangs over the side of the saddle. She\u2019s small and fine-boned like a doll and wearing a truly menacing smile.\nThe deck rocks underfoot. Zuko stumbles, dropping the broom. A wave crests the side of the ship, and Zuko has a moment to send up an apology to uncle for dying on him, before the wave skims the surface of the deck and encircles his waist. Zuko\u2019s feet leave the ship. He yelps, scrambling for purchase, unable to keep himself from being thrown up into the air.\nHe lands on Appa\u2019s saddle, sopping wet. He blinks dazedly at his friends and their new member, leaning into Sokka and cackling.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve gotten better,\u201d Zuko says, blinking sea-water out of his eyes.\nKatara smiles sweetly, and it\u2019s the same look Azula used to shoot him before setting his tunic on fire. \u201cThank you.\u201d\nThe earthbender snorts. \u201cI would have done anything to see those early kidnapping attempts.\u201d\n\u201cHey,\u201d Sokka says, \u201cmy story-telling was pretty good, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cIt was,\u201d she agrees, before turning that feral smile on Zuko. \u201cDid you really flail that much?\u201d\nZuko wrings water out of his braid, scowling. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Katara says.\n\u201cYes!\u201d Aang agrees from behind the reins. \u201cHi, Zuko! I wanted to be the one to kidnap you, but Katara said it was her turn since I did it last time.\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re on dry land next, I\u2019m totally doing the kidnapping,\u201d the earthbender tells him.\nZuko sighs. \u201cThere won\u2019t be a next time.\u201d\nThe earthbender shrugs, unbothered. \u201cThat\u2019s what you think.\u201d\nWhat a horribly ominous statement.\nZuko agreed a while back that he would go willingly when the Avatar and his friends needed him. He\u2019s had weeks to come to terms with his decisions. Weeks of Iroh\u2019s proud, secretive smile and proverbs and last-minute firebending lessons, so he remembers everything he needs to pass onto Aang. He\u2019d been worried that his panic would rise up like the ocean and smother him when it was time to leave the Jasmine Dragon, but he feels bright and steady as the midday sun. Looking around at the faces of his friends, he can\u2019t remember why he was ever afraid of loving them.\n\u201cNEPHEW!\u201d\nZuko gasps. \u201cI didn\u2019t say goodbye to Uncle!\u201d\nAang circles back around and flies lower. Katara lowers him back down to his ship using the same arm of water, drenching Zuko further. As soon as he\u2019s in arms reach, Iroh crushes him to his chest.\n\u201cI\u2019m so proud of you, Prince Zuko,\u201d Iroh murmurs, quiet enough that only Zuko will hear. It is the first time Iroh has called him \u2018prince\u2019 in a very long time. Years. Hearing it now is a shock, waking him up. \u201cPlease be safe and come back to me in one piece.\u201d\n\u201cI will,\u201d Zuko says, and means it. He won\u2019t force Iroh to grieve another son.\nThe crew have gathered to see him off. Zuko quietly puts up with them passing him around, giving hugs and thumps on the arm and hair ruffles, though he scowls the whole time and tries valiantly to pretend he\u2019s not blushing.\nIroh hands him his things: his bag, packed weeks ago; his dao swords, polished and tucked into their scabbards; a heavy bag of food from Chef; and a slightly smaller bag full of tea.\nThis time, it\u2019s Zuko that pulls Iroh into a hug. His chest aches. He doesn\u2019t want to leave this ship, the one that has become a home to him, but staying here feels too much like running away. And his friends need him.\nZuko pulls away. If his breathing has gone shaky and Iroh\u2019s eyes are red-rimmed, no one comments on it.\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you soon,\u201d Zuko says, because he can\u2019t bring himself to say goodbye.\nAs Katara heaves him back to Appa, Zuko waves to everyone on the Jasmine Dragon. They stand on the deck, seeing him off, until Appa flies too high and they lose sight of each other.\n\u201cIs that bread I smell?\u201d the earthbender says loudly, inching across the saddle to get to Zuko and the fresh bakery smell. When she\u2019s within reaching distance, she touches his arm, trying to untangle him from the food, and then stops. \u201cYou\u2019re warm. Really warm.\u201d\nZuko gapes at her. \u201cIt took Sokka weeks to figure that out. We only just met!\u201d\n\u201cWarm,\u201d says the earthbender again, and curls up against Zuko\u2019s shoulder.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe earthbender\u2019s name is Toph. She\u2019s blind and twelve and more powerful than most earthbenders Zuko has met before.\nZuko likes her immediately.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cSugar queen,\u201d Toph says into the best damn curry she\u2019s ever tasted in her life, \u201cyou\u2019re fired.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I said!\u201d Sokka says, already on his second serving.\n\u201cIf you didn\u2019t like my food,\u201d Katara huffs, \u201cthen you didn\u2019t have to eat it.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that we didn\u2019t like it,\u201d Sokka backpedals, \u201cit\u2019s just that Zuko is very talented. He works on a tea boat! A professional fancy tea boat! Of course he\u2019s going to have some culinary talents.\u201d\nZuko grimaces. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you could call the Jasmine Dragon professional or fancy. It\u2019s run out of decommissioned warship.\u201d\nToph lowers her spoon. \u201cWait. You sell tea out of an old Fire Nation warship? What the fuck. How did you manage to swing that? Did you steal it?\u201d\n\u201cUh,\u201d Zuko says.\n\u201cThey\u2019re Fire Nation, remember?\u201d Aang pipes up.\nToph waves him off. \u201cYeah, I know, but it\u2019s still a warship. Are you ex-military, firefly?\u201d\n\u201cUh,\u201d Zuko says again. \u201cNo, but everyone else on the Jasmine Dragon used to be in the army. Like my Uncle. They, uh, discharged themselves a couple of years ago. The war...\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go into it,\u201d Katara says softly, laying a hand on Zuko\u2019s knee. Toph can\u2019t blame her for the casual contact; she always thought she disliked being touched before she joined up with this band of misfits and met their firebender. Touching him feels like laying out on a sun-warmed rock on a cool winter day.\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Zuko says, equally soft.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nZuko sidles up to Toph midway through Aang\u2019s training. \u201cAre you okay? I saw you fighting with Katara earlier.\u201d\nToph ignores him. Her arms are crossed, legs shoulder-width apart, focused entirely on Aang\u2019s clumsy bending.\nZuko wishes that Uncle were here. He\u2019d know what to say. \u201cYou know, it took me a really long time to be able to make small talk with customers in the Earth Kingdom. I\u2019ve never, uh, been great with small talk in general. I\u2019m still not\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Toph cuts in, \u201cyou\u2019re blowing me away with your conversation skills.\u201d\nZuko runs a hand through his hair, his fringe dry with dust. \u201cIt took a long time for me to get over the cultural difference, I mean. I\u2019d never even seen people who weren\u2019t Fire Nation before I\u2014um. Left it.\u201d He barges past that fumble quickly. \u201cIt took me a while to learn how to speak a different language as a tea server. And isn\u2019t that what you\u2019re doing with us?\u201d\nToph snorts. \u201cYou trying to say I should start speaking Katara\u2019s language? I understand her just fine, bus boy.\u201d\nAang twirls several fist-sized rocks into the air with a flourish. Toph stomps her foot. The rocks clutter to the ground and Aang\u2019s eyes go wide.\n\u201cAirbending, twinkle toes!\u201d\nAang looks like a kicked badger-dog. \u201cSorry, Sifu Toph. It\u2019s a habit.\u201d\n\u201cToo bad! More boulder laps.\u201d\nAang groans and heaves the boulder back onto his shoulders. He takes off at a fast run around the makeshift training area.\nToph scowls, turning to face Zuko full-on. \u201cLook, sparky, I don\u2019t need another lecture about knowing my place and pulling my weight or whatever. Especially not from someone that spent months being kidnapped by these idiots. One of us didn\u2019t need to be abducted into helping the Avatar and it wasn\u2019t you.\u201d\nZuko winces. She\u2019s not wrong. He\u2019s never willingly made a change like she has. It took being banished for him to see Ozai for who he really was. Not even burning half his face off in front of the entire court did that.\nAnd even then, it took almost-daily kidnappings for him to befriend the Avatar. Toph, at twelve, is braver than he\u2019s ever been.\nZuko wets his lips, following Aang\u2019s unsteady progress with his eyes. \u201cWhen the Jasmine Dragon first opened, I was terrible at regular chores. I burnt the tea and soaked the deck when I tried to mop it and turned everyone\u2019s under-things pink when it was my turn to do laundry. Even though I liked the work.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to make me suddenly like cleaning dishes.\u201d\n\u201cYou belong here,\u201d Zuko tells her just as Uncle had told him years ago, when he was young and easily frustrated and still made foul-tasting tea. \u201cThat means you do what the rest of us do. Teach Aang. Tease Sokka. And yeah, wash dishes. It\u2019s not about doing things because someone says you should, it\u2019s about doing things because they\u2019re the right thing to do. Because it makes someone else\u2019s life a little easier.\u201d\nToph goes quiet, though she\u2019s still scowling. It had taken Zuko years to truly understand what Uncle had been saying to him all along, and even now, half of Uncle\u2019s proverbs still fly over his head.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to guilt me into helping with the cooking,\u201d she says at least.\n\u201cNot trying to guilt you into anything,\u201d Zuko says, stepping away. \u201cJust giving some advice. Uncle says it\u2019s a server\u2019s job to be good at gossip and advice, as well as brewing a good cup of tea.\u201d\nThat actually earns him a laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re good at gossiping?\u201d\nZuko grimaces. \u201cNo. Not really.\u201d He has no idea how Uncle does it so effortlessly with so many different people, a Pai Sho table between them and the world\u2019s current events on their lips. \u201cBut if you listen to someone doing it for long enough, you start to pick up the basics.\u201d\nHe pulls out a small bundle of biscuits cooked over the campfire and throws them at her. Another thing he learnt from Uncle: treats go a long way.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do anything you don\u2019t want to,\u201d Zuko says, \u201cbut think about what I said, okay? Properly being a part of something can feel pretty amazing.\u201d\nAang spots Toph eating biscuits and shouts, \u201cCan I have some too?\u201d\nToph shoves them all into her mouth. With a spray of crumbs, she yells back, \u201cKeep going, arrow-head! You have another twenty laps to go!\u201d\nZuko\u2019s laugh doesn\u2019t manage to cover up Aang\u2019s groan.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAang is normally the first person asleep in the evenings. That was previously Zuko, since Katara and Sokka are Water Tribe. Even if Sokka is a non-bender, he is still a descendent of the moon spirit, and the night affects him, though not as strongly as it affects Katara.\nBut now, all of Aang\u2019s boundless energy is going towards training with all three of his teachers. He only recently grasped earthbending--a mammoth task, according to Toph--and is now learning firebending basics.\nZuko has conferred with Katara and Toph more than once. They need to keep Aang\u2019s lessons separate. They don\u2019t have the luxury of time, so they can\u2019t space them out further, give Aang a longer break between, but they can keep an eye on him and make sure their conflicting bending styles aren\u2019t slipping through. Not in a way that\u2019s detrimental to Aang, anyway.\nMaybe it will be good for him. The four elements are more interconnected than people realise. Aang is the bridge between them, and his bending style would have always become a mash of the four elements. And maybe, because he is being taught by three different masters in such close proximity, the four bending arts will come together to make something even stronger. Maybe that will make something beautiful.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAang, splayed out on the dry ground, hoping the spirit world will do him this one solid and let him melt through the veil between worlds so he could be incorporeal for a while.\n\u201cShe\u2019s a little rough,\u201d Katara says, \u201cbut you were the one who was so insistent on making her your earthbending teacher.\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me! Well. It was me. But it was the spirits guiding me to her.\u201d Aang closes his eyes, his lids appearing deep red where the sun pierces through them. He\u2019s too sore to raise his arm over his face to block it. \u201cThey\u2019ve been guiding me all along. Even with you and Sokka and Zuko. And now with Toph \u2026 I just didn\u2019t expect this to be so hard.\u201d He laughs weakly. \u201cAnd I was so excited to finally have three masters to teach me.\u201d\n\u201cAang,\u201d Sokka interrupts.\nAang peers up at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d\nSokka brandishes his sword and gestures for Aang to get to his feet. \u201cAll four masters. Come on, pupil Aang, up you get. We\u2019re wasting daylight.\u201d\n\u201cSokka, I\u2019m the Avatar. I don\u2019t need to learn how to use a sword.\u201d\n\u201cAw, but I feel so left out. I want to kick you around, too!\u201d\n\n\u201cSokka no.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThere\u2019s no time for mini-vacations,\u201d Sokka says, looking as stern as any teenager standing in a chorus of goffers can.\n\u201cSokka\u2019s not wrong,\u201d Zuko says, a phrase that feels fundamentally wrong coming out of his mouth--not because Sokka is usually wrong when it comes to planning, but because of the smug look that takes over Sokka\u2019s face when he says it. Katara looks like she\u2019s going to water-whip Sokka, but then thinks better of it.\nAang wilts, lowering his flute. \u201cI\u2019m learning the elements as fast as I can. I practise hard every day with Toph, Katara, and Zuko. I have three masters now. I\u2019ve been training my arrow off!\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with having a little fun in our down time?\u201d Katara sounds just like Uncle. Not for the first time that week, homesickness threatens to drag Zuko under.\nToph nudges him in the side, and Zuko musters up a small smile for her. She huffs. He doesn\u2019t know how she reads him so well, especially being blind. Maybe it\u2019s because she\u2019s blind. He doesn\u2019t mind it, though. She might snore and eat the last of the leftovers (something he\u2019s familiar with, after living on the Jasmine Dragon), and fight with him about hogging Aang, but. She\u2019s family now.\nThe others don\u2019t notice their silent exchange.\n\u201cEven if you do master all of the elements,\u201d Sokka says, \u201cthen what? It\u2019s not like we have a map of the Fire Nation. Should we just head West until we reach the Fire Lord\u2019s house? And then knock?\u201d\n\u201cUm,\u201d Zuko says. Everyone turns to him. \u201cI know where the Fire Lord\u2019s house is.\u201d He shakes his head. The word \u2018house\u2019 feels wrong in his mouth, just like the word \u2018home\u2019 used to. \u201cPalace,\u201d he amends. \u201cI know where the Fire Palace is.\u201d\nBecause I lived there for thirteen years, he doesn\u2019t say.\nSokka smacks himself in the forehead. \u201cOf course! We have a walking encyclopedia of Fire Nation knowledge. Sorry, Zuko. I forget you\u2019re Fire Nation on account of the whole \u2018you\u2019re not evil\u2019 thing.\u201d\nZuko never forgets. He\u2019s hyper aware of the sun\u2019s position, its strong rays beating down on the arid desert. The blandness of Earth Kingdom. The wrongness of green and brown in place of red and black.\nThe Jasmine Dragon is the homing beacon his heart wants to return to. He only visits the Fire Palace when he\u2019s asleep.\n\u201cCould you make a map?\u201d Sokka asks. \u201cOr provide us with Fire Nation intelligence?\u201d\n\u201cZuko, providing intelligence? No way,\u201d Toph says, and then laughs when he whirls on her, offended. \u201cCome on, Sokka basically dangled the joke in front of me. I had to.\u201d\n\u201cI could probably draw a rough map,\u201d Zuko says, still glaring at Toph, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know how useful it\u2019ll be. It\u2019s been years since I was in the Fire Nation so my knowledge isn\u2019t current.\u201d\nZuko might have spent years being drilled on geography by strict tutors, but he hasn\u2019t had any reason to look at a Fire Nation map since he was banished.\nSokka looks much more relaxed. \u201cIt\u2019s something, at least. I knew picking you up was a good idea.\u201d\n\u201cYou wanted to clobber him with your boomerang when we first met,\u201d Katara corrects.\nSokka weaves through the goffer tunnels and throws his arms around Zuko. He instinctively hugs back, even if only to keep them both from toppling over into the dirt. \u201cThat was before I knew him! I appreciate him now. Our cooking, fire-lighting, map-creating, intelligence-having firebender.\u201d\n\u201cSokka, get off me or I\u2019m not drawing you anything.\u201d\nSokka jumps away from Zuko. \u201cRight. I\u2019ll just \u2026 I\u2019ll fetch us some paper.\u201d\nAfter Zuko starts outlining the draft of a map and Aang spends some more time playing with the goffers, they go to Katara\u2019s mini-vacation: a very disappointing natural ice spring. And there, they meet a professor, who tells them about a very sketchy sounding library in the middle of the desert. Zuko is quietly excited by the thought of ancient theater scrolls.\n\u201cZuko said he doesn\u2019t have current information,\u201d Sokka says, perched eagerly on the edge of Appa\u2019s saddle as they circle the desert.\n\u201cAnd an ancient library will?\u201d Toph throws back.\nSokka points at her. \u201cOkay, no, but Zuko is a tea server. He isn\u2019t going to know about the important stuff, like palace schematics or naval bases. Right, Zuko?\u201d\nZuko, who learnt about all of those things as the Crown Prince to the Fire Nation, swallows, throat suddenly dry. He musters up a smile that doesn\u2019t feel right on his face. \u201cRight.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe library begins to collapse around them. Sokka and Aang sprint in the other direction, while Katara pulls him behind a shadow aisle to hide. Zuko watches his friends go, and realises that, even though he left the safety of the Jasmine Dragon, he\u2019s still not sure if this war is worth fighting if it means his friends lay down their lives.\nHe doesn\u2019t say that, though.\nWhen they remerge in the desert, barely escaping being trapped underground with a vengeful spirit for the rest of their lives, they find Toph collapsed on her knees. Just Toph.\n\u201cWe did it!\u201d Sokka says, tackling Katara in a hug. \u201cThere\u2019s a solar eclipse coming. The Fire Nation\u2019s in trouble now.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you were after?\u201d Zuko snaps, whirling on them. His heart still feels like it\u2019s going to crawl out of his mouth. \u201cA worthless eclipse?\u201d\nSokka pulls away from Katara. \u201cBut firebenders can\u2019t bend during an eclipse. They\u2019ll be defenseless. If we attack on that day, then--\u201d\n\u201cThe royal family are as paranoid as they are crazy,\u201d Zuko says, feeling hollow. \u201cYou don\u2019t think the Fire Nation doesn\u2019t know that our bending can be switched off? That\u2019s the one day they\u2019ll be expecting an attack. They\u2019ll have Fire Sages tracking the movement of the stars in preparation of the eclipse. That \u2026\u201d He sinks to the ground. It still feels like the sand underneath him is shifting, falling, the library burying even deeper into the earth far below them. \u201cThat\u2019s nothing, Sokka.\u201d\nSokka stares at him, scroll tucked to his chest. \u201cBut \u2026 But that\u2019s all we have. If we don\u2019t--\u201d\nAnd then Aang asks, in a very small voice, \u201cWhere\u2019s Appa?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey almost die in the desert. Toph and Aang become despondent in the wake of Appa\u2019s disappearance. Sokka becomes desperate for something after his last-ditch effort to form a plan was struck down so quickly by Zuko.\nKatara swings between looking lost and fiercely determined. One night, as they lay down to sleep she inches close to him, the way she might if it was a cold night and the others were using him as a heat source.\nHer eyes are wet. \u201cThank you,\u201d she whispers, reaching for his hand.\nZuko blinks. \u201cWhy are you thanking me? I\u2019m just as lost as you are.\u201d\n\u201cBut you\u2019re here. You\u2019re a firebender, I know you\u2019re not going to go mad with heat-stroke like the others. If you hadn\u2019t agreed to join us, I would have had to look after the others by myself, and I ...\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d do an amazing job,\u201d Zuko says.\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d she allows, sniffling. \u201cBut the thought still scares me.\u201d\nZuko grips her hand. He doesn\u2019t admit that the idea of them being all alone out here, without him, scares him too.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAfter they\u2019re denied entry to Ba Sing Se, they pick up three refugees and an old friend.\n\u201cLook at you,\u201d Suki says, pulling Zuko into a hug. \u201cYou\u2019re out and about, making friends and fighting in the war. Who\u2019d have thought?\u201d\nZuko squirms out of her grip, face warm. \u201cYou sound like Uncle.\u201d\n\u201cHow is Iroh?\u201d she asks. \u201cIs he the one that set you up with this lot? He\u2019s been meaning to find you more friends, you know. More than just the Kyoshi Warriors, anyway.\u201d\nZuko looks over her shoulder. Aang is carefully not looking at them. \u201cUncle is fine. He wasn\u2019t the one that introduced me to Aang. He did that himself. Forcefully.\u201d\nSuki blinks. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cThey kidnapped him,\u201d Toph interjects, grinning. \u201cLike, multiple times. Scooped him off his little tea boat and soared away, like a hawk-sparrow snatching up a baby mouse-bat.\u201d\nSuki bursts out laughing. \u201cYou guys kidnapped him?\u201d\n\u201cHey,\u201d Aang defends. \u201cI needed a firebending teacher, and he kept running away!\u201d\nZuko sighs. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer.\u201d\n\u201cOh, no,\u201d Suki says, though she\u2019s still fighting not to laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re not being held against your will, are you, Zuko? Do I need to rescue you from the Avatar?\u201d\n\u201cI joined them on my own this time,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cThey wore me down.\u201d\nToph elbows him. \u201cNo, I kidnapped him.\u201d\n\u201cI let you kidnap me!\u201d\nThe three refugees are standing off to the side, watching them and clearly very confused. \u201cThe Avatar kidnaps people?\u201d\nThey look at Zuko worryingly. \u201cYou\u2019re a firebender?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good firebender,\u201d Sokka says.\n\u201cHe has the Avatar seal of approval,\u201d Aang says. \u201cHe\u2019s my firebending teacher. He\u2019s a good guy. And he makes great tea!\u201d\nAfter the sandbenders tell them Appa was taken to Ba Sing Se, after Aang slips beneath the angry thrall of the Avatar State, after a long trip where they encounter Suki and refugee couple who seem wary of Zuko but eventually warm up to him, they make it to Ba Sing Se.\nThe Fire Nation beats them there.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nZuko stays at the back of the group. He knows that in green and brown, hair braided simply down his back, he passes easily as an Earth Kingdom native. But sometimes, if he ventures too close to people who have seen firebenders\u2013fought firebenders\u2013they\u2019ll see the gold flash of his eyes and know who he is. What he is. And here, in the Earth Kingdom capital, with the Jasmine Dragon so far away, his identity has the potential to ruin them.\nGeneral Sung smiles sunnily at them. \u201cI assure you, the Fire Nation cannot penetrate Ba Sing Se. Many have tried to break through it, but none have succeeded.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about the Dragon of the West?\u201d Toph asks. \u201cHe got in.\u201d\nZuko is suddenly very interested in his sand-covered boots. So dusty. The leather is almost yellow from days of walking. So fascinating.\nGeneral Sung clears his throat. \u201cYes, but he was quickly expunged.\u201d\nThey watch as an elite team of earthbenders are swifty taken down. From this distance, they don\u2019t see who subdues them so quickly and efficiently, but it leaves Zuko feeling cold all over and General Sung desperate enough to accept Aang\u2019s offer of help.\nThey meet the defeated earthbenders in the healers\u2019 room. There are no visible wounds, though all of them are immobile. Their limp, unharmed forms, most of them conscious but groaning and twitching faintly, itches at the back of Zuko\u2019s mind.\nKatara kneels beside an earthbender, her hands glowing blue. \u201cHis chi is blocked\u2026 Who did this to you?\u201d\n\u201cTwo girls ambushed us,\u201d says the earthbender. \u201cOne of us hit me with a bunch of quick jabs, and suddenly I couldn\u2019t earthbend and I could barely move. And then she cartwheeled away.\u201d\nA chi-bender. A cartwheeling chi-bender.\nTy Lee would hate the brutality of the drill, such an ugly and large eyesore. And he can\u2019t remember her ever being interested in or motivated in the war. She cared about greater ideals.\nLike friendship.\nZuko stumbles back, throat tight. There\u2019s nowhere to run. He\u2019s at the very top of Ba Sing Se\u2019s impenetrable wall and below him, closer than she has been in years, is his sister. Has she come to drag him home?\nHe never should have left the Jasmine Dragon, he thinks, one hand knotted in his hair. He never should have dreamed that he could be anything more than a tea server, or that the world could be anything more than what it already is.\n\u201cIt must be Ty Lee.\u201d Katara\u2019s voice sounds very far away. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t look dangerous, but she knows the human body and its weak points. It\u2019s like she takes you down from the inside.\u201d\nShe used to practice on him sometimes. She wasn\u2019t as talented when they were very small. It only worked sometimes and it would hurt rather than feel numb like it was supposed to, but she would always apologise and weave flowers in his hair to make it up to him, and\u2013and\u2013\nZuko can\u2019t breathe.\n\u201cOh, oh, oh!\u201d Sokka says, jumping in place. \u201cWhat you just said: that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to take down the drill. The same way Ty Lee took down all these big earthbenders.\u201d\nToph touches his elbow. \u201cZuko, are you alright?\u201d\nGeneral Sung wrings his hands together, glancing between them. \u201cIs your friend alright?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Zuko manages, eyes squeezed shut. \u201cI just\u2026 need to sit down.\u201d\nGeneral Sung escorts him to a nearby storage room, empty save for dusty boxes. Toph stays long enough for him to wrestle control of his breathing. She takes his hand, squeezing his fingers, and promises to be back as soon as she can.\nHis thoughts come flooding back when she leaves, overwhelming him. He holds on for as long as he can. He runs through Uncle\u2019s breathing exercises and steady mantras\u2013I am safe; I am loved; I am far away from him\u2013but every time he opens his eyes and sees a cramped cupboard instead of the Jasmine Dragon\u2019s familiar walls, his calm slips away.\nTime passes in a strange and unknowable haze. When his friends return, Zuko feels numb and far-away from his body. He flinches when hands reach for him, but the familiar murmur of voices and faces brings him back to himself and, with a gasp, he shuffles closer and lets them hold him.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHis friends are watching him. They had seen how calm he had been at the Northern Water Tribe with an armada beating down their door. And somehow now, suddenly, he falls apart.\nToph is a steady lump by his side. She pokes him in the cheek whenever he starts to drift away again. \u201cSparky, you need to calm down or your heart is going to beat right out of your chest, and then we\u2019ll have to find someone else to cook for us.\u201d\n\u201cI can cook,\u201d Katara says, indignant.\nToph huffs. \u201cBarely.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d Aang says, getting in between them. \u201cI think we\u2019re all just a little concerned about what happened earlier. Panic attacks don\u2019t always have to have a cause, but it looked like something set you off, Zuko. Can you tell us what happened? So we don\u2019t accidentally hurt you in the future?\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t any of you,\u201d Zuko says, fidgeting in place. \u201cI just\u2026 thought I recognised someone.\u201d\n\u201cTy Lee?\u201d Katara guesses. \u201cHave you run into her before? Her chi-blocks are no joke, especially for benders.\u201d\nZuko fiddles with his sleeves. He wants to get up and make tea, but the apartment is still empty. If they were going to stay here, he would have to go to the markets and stock up.\nThree sets of eyes peer curiously at him. Toph\u2019s gaze has settled on his left knee, but he can tell she\u2019s listening intently, even if she\u2019s lounging against him and picking at her nails.\nHe hasn\u2019t willingly told anyone who he was since he gave up on capturing the Avatar. Sometimes, people would squint and cock their heads like they were trying to recall where they had seen him before, but he always had Iroh and the rest of the crew to lie for him.\nBut these are his friends. He trusts them.\nZuko shoves his hands under his thighs to stop them from shaking. \u201cI knew Ty Lee from before\u2026 before. I know Mai and Azula, too.\u201d\nThey hadn\u2019t told him that Mai and Azula were there, but they had to be. Ty Lee wouldn\u2019t be on that drill for anyone other than Azula, and if she had been recruited into the mission then Mai would have joined them.\n\u201cBefore you left the Fire Nation,\u201d Sokka says.\nKatara looks like she wants to shuffle closer but is worried about crowding him. \u201cThey didn\u2019t hurt you, did they?\u201d\nZuko laughs, an unkind sound. How does he answer that? \u201cNo. Not really. We were ...\u201d Not friends. Not properly, the way they might have been without Azula\u2019s influence. \u201cAzula is\u2013she\u2019s\u2013she\u2019s\u2013\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Zuko,\u201d Katara says gently. \u201cTake your time.\u201d\nAzula has been tasked with taking Aang down, since the Avatar has proven to be more than a spirit tale, and Zuko has shown he is not up to the task. She\u2019s fourteen and that feels impossibly young, but then again, she\u2019s older than Zuko was.\nAzula isn\u2019t going away. And if he doesn\u2019t tell his friends who he is, then she will.\nHe inhales and says in a rush, before he can lose his nerve, \u201cAzula is my sister.\u201d\nAang blinks. Katara\u2019s face tightens with something like confusion, something like disgust. Sokka\u2019s mouth falls open.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Toph says, \u201cI didn\u2019t see that one coming.\u201d There\u2019s a pause. \u201cGet it? Because I\u2019m blind?\u201d\nZuko laughs and covers his face with both hands.\n\u201cHang on, when you say sister\u2013\u201d Sokka waves his hands at Katara. \u201c--you mean sister -sister?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Zuko says.\n\u201cAs in you\u2019re related? Biologically. To her.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s how that works, yeah.\u201d\n\u201cThe evil psychopathic princess is your sister?\u201d\n\u201cAs we\u2019ve established. Yes.\u201d\n\u201cSo, then...\u201d Katar presses her fingers to her mouth, as though she\u2019s scared of her own words. \u201cFire Lord Ozai is...\u201d\n\u201cYour father,\u201d Aang finishes.\nZuko blows out a breath. There it is. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t think to mention that before?\u201d Sokka demands.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like thinking about it.\u201d Zuko stands. He suddenly has too much energy. He paces in a loose circle around the room. \u201cAnd what would I have even said, anyway? \u2018Hi, I\u2019m Zuko. I\u2019ll be your tea server this evening, and oh, also I\u2019m the Fire Lord\u2019s firstborn son. Would you like Ginseng or Jasmine tea?\u2019\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Sokka splutters, \u201cthat would have made us leave you alone, at least.\u201d\n\u201cWould it have?\u201d Zuko asks, glancing at Aang.\nAang shrugs. \u201cProbably not. I wouldn\u2019t have cared that much.\u201d\n\u201cI would have cared,\u201d Sokka says, pushing to his feet. He wavers in the middle of the room, vibrating with tension, setting off all of Zuko\u2019s worn instincts. Sokka scrubs a hand through his hair. \u201cSpirits. The Northern Water Tribe would have drowned you if they had found out.\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a prince, then that explains all the fancy-pants dishes you can make,\u201d Toph says. \u201cGood work getting out, by the way. Nobility sucks.\u201d\n\u201cNot nobility,\u201d Sokka says, \u201cRoyalty! What the fuck, Zuko?\u201d\n\u201cSokka,\u201d Katara says, \u201ccalm down.\u201d\n\u201cMe? Why are the rest of you so calm!?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d Katara\u2019s face is placid, but her eyes--her eyes are burning. Zuko shivers and takes a few steps back. \u201cBut I realise that freaking out about this isn\u2019t going to actually help. Zuko is our friend, even if he lied to us\u2013\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t lying,\u201d Zuko interrupts. \u201cI just\u2013I\u2013I\u2019ve been trying for three years to escape my father. I\u2019ve been trying to forget the fact that I was once a prince. I didn\u2019t tell you, because that\u2019s not who I want to be anymore.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s telling the truth,\u201d Toph says.\n\u201cOf course I\u2019m telling the truth! I never lied to you about who I am, just who I was. I don\u2019t like thinking about my past.\u201d He swallows, keeping his eyes on the ground. \u201cIf you guys decide that you don\u2019t want me around anymore, then fine. You can drop me back at the Jasmine Dragon when we find Appa and leave Ba Sing Se.\u201d\nAll the energy leaves Sokka at once. \u201cOf course I don\u2019t want that. None of us do. Right, guys?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re one of us,\u201d Aang says firmly.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t change who you are,\u201d Toph agrees. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what the big deal is. People are just people, regardless of who their parents are. And sometimes we\u2019re born to the wrong people, and we have to leave to become who we\u2019re supposed to be.\u201d\nThey all look at her. Zuko feels warm deep inside his chest, his fire-core has been stoked by her words. Toph flushes pink. \u201cI can feel you all staring! Stop it. This is supposed to be about Zuko.\u201d\n\u201cThat was really lovely, Toph,\u201d Aang says.\n\u201cFuck off, twinkle-toes.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSokka finds him outside, sitting at the edge of their courtyard and staring up at the sky. Nights like these remind him of calm nights on the ocean with the moon glaring down at them, illuminating the miles of nothingness on either side of the Jasmine Dragon. It reminds him of Yue. It reminds him of late-night summer festivals with Lu Ten and Azula when they were small.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk,\u201d Zuko says, not looking away from the half-moon .\nSokka drops down next to him. \u201cI didn\u2019t come to talk.\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d Zuko says doubtfully.\n\u201cWhat you said today\u2013it\u2019s a lot. I get it.\u201d\n\u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, no, I don\u2019t,\u201d Sokka allows. \u201cI have no idea what it\u2019d be like to have the Fire Lord as a father, but I get that I won\u2019t get it. And I get that you probably need space right now.\u201d\nZuko squints at him. \u201cYou\u2019re really bad at this.\u201d\nSokka ignores that. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking,\u201d he goes on. Zuko braces himself. Here it comes, he thinks. The realisation that Zuko isn\u2019t worth the risk. \u201cWhat if we delayed the invasion?\u201d\nIt takes Zuko a moment to process that. \u201cAre you still going on about the eclipse? Sokka, I told you that it won\u2019t work\u2013\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Sokka interrupts, \u201cbut what if we waited? They\u2019re expecting an invasion during the eclipse, so their defenses will be up. And then once their powers come back, they\u2019ll let their guard down again. That\u2019s when we strike.\u201d\n\u201cYou want,\u201d Zuko says slowly, trying to understand the full scope of Sokka\u2019s studidly, \u201cto attack the Fire Nation capital when they\u2019re at their full power?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Sokka says.\n\u201cDo you realise how dumb you sound?\u201d\n\u201cExactly! It\u2019s so dumb they\u2019ll never see it coming.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAfter talking with Sokka, Zuko manages to fall asleep for about an hour. He\u2019s woken at dawn, sweaty and disoriented in a way he never is at daybreak. Years-old memories are burnt into his eyelids. Every time he blinks, he sees his mother turning away from him, his father looming over him, his sister laughing at his warped face\nHe washes and throws his hair up into a ponytail, too tired to even bother braiding it. He shuffles into the kitchen and begins brewing tea. For once, the rest of the friends are awake before him. Even Sokka. Zuko wonders if they even slept.\n\u201cWait.\u201d Sokka is squinting at the map of the Fire Palace Zuko drew for him. He\u2019s still not sure how accurate it is. Memories become distorted with time, after all. \u201cIf Zuko is a prince, why am I trying to work out how to sneak inside the palace? Can\u2019t you just stroll up to the front door? You lived there. It\u2019s your house.\u201d\nZuko hands Toph a mug of tea. \u201cThey\u2019d arrest me if I tried.\u201d\nAang accepts his own tea with a sunny smile. \u201cIt\u2019s not because you\u2019re associated with us, is it? I know it probably doesn\u2019t look great that you\u2019re friends with the Avatar\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s because I\u2019m not legally allowed in the Fire Nation. I was banished.\u201d\n\n\u201cBanished?\u201d \n\n\u201cCool,\u201d Toph says.\n\u201cToph.\u201d Katara scowls at her, even as she accepts her own mug of tea from Zuko. \u201cIt\u2019s not cool, it\u2019s awful. Zuko, what happened?\u201d\n\u201cIf you go to the Fire Palace, I\u2019m not coming with you,\u201d Zuko tells Sokka, ignoring Katara\u2019s question.\nSokka purses his lips. \u201cYou\u2019re the only person that knows their way around. The Fire Nation has the home-advantage and we need you there to level the playing field as much as possible.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be with you the entire time,\u201d Aang reassures him.\nZuko shakes his head. \u201cI was foolish enough to think I was safe in the Fire Palace before. Even after my father burned me, I still thought everything would be okay if I just worked harder and tried to prove to my father that I was a dutiful son. But Uncle taught me better. I\u2019m free and I\u2019m never going back.\u201d\nThe room is quiet. Toph has stopped smiling, and Sokka is frozen, tea halfway to his lips.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Zuko says.\n\u201cBurned you,\u201d Aang says, something almost fearful in his voice. \u201cYou said your father burned you.\u201d\nKatara puts her tea down. Her eyes are wide. \u201cZuko, where did you get your scar?\u201d\nZuko\u2019s first instinct is to lie or deflect. But he\u2019s told them this much already. Is there any point to trying to avoid things now? It\u2019s almost freeing, he supposes, to get everything out into the open.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault,\u201d Iroh has told him, over and over again, enough times that Zuko finally started to believe him. \u201cYou have no reason to be ashamed.\u201d\nZuko cups his tea between his palms, letting the warmth ground him. He\u2019s never had to say this out loud before, and finds the story coming to him in fits and starts. \u201cI fought in an Agni Kai. I\u2013there was this general. I had convinced Uncle to let me sit in on a War Council meeting, and he was talking about sacrificing a battalion of young recruits. I was just a kid and didn\u2019t know about how terrible war can really be. I could barely understand what I was hearing. I spoke up against him.\n\u201cThat was seen as an act of disrespect, so. Agni Kai.\u201d\n\u201cFire duel,\u201d Aang translates for the rest of them.\nZuko nods jerkily. \u201cRight. I assumed it would be against the General. He was the one I had spoken out against. But it had been in the Fire Lord\u2019s council room.\u201d\n\u201cOh no,\u201d Katara murmurs.\n\u201cWhen the time came, and I turned around and saw my father standing opposite me, I did what any loyal son would do: I got on my knees and begged for his forgiveness. I loved him. I couldn\u2019t fight him. And in his eyes, that made me a coward. So he ...\u201d Zuko gestures to his face. To the grotesque scar.\nSokka swears, jerking back and accidentally knocking his cup. Tea spills down his front and across the table. Sokka dives for the map of the palace and there\u2019s a mad scramble as they all try to rescue the parchment before it can be too heavily stained by tea.\nWhen the table is cleared and the tea mopped up, they return to the table in muted silence.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry that happened to you,\u201d Katara begins, \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry for pushing you as hard as we did when we first met. You had a good reason for never wanting to get involved with the Fire Nation again.\u201d\nZuko shakes his head, no. \u201cYou were right. I couldn\u2019t have kept pretending that the war didn\u2019t exist. I live in this world. I have to face it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nZuko pulls himself out of bed well before dawn. He only managed an hour or two of sleep before he was woken by nightmares, and he can\u2019t take it anymore. The unfamiliar bed. The strange room. He\u2019s used to sleeping on a ship or on the ground or on Appa. He was a prince once, but sleeping in a house unnerves him.\nOr maybe it\u2019s the knowledge that he was so close to Azula just a few days ago, or that his friends now know who he is. They took the news better than he had expected, but just the act of telling them, of saying it all loud, had ripped open an old wound he hadn\u2019t realised could still bleed.\nZuko puts on a brown tunic and plaits his hair in an Earth Kingdom style, then he slips out the window.\nThe wealth in the upper ring sets him on edge, so he heads down to the middle ring and then keeps going down to the lower tings.\nHe\u2019s surprised by the lower ring, then surprised by his own surprise. Maybe he\u2019d tricked himself into thinking that the Fire Nation were the only source of evil in the world.\nHe ducks into a tea house mid-morning. The empty store is dim and smells of mildew, nothing like the Jasmine Dragon, but it\u2019s quiet and out of the way.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you around here before,\u201d says the merchant, Pao. He pours Zuko a fresh cup of tea.\n\u201cMy friends and I arrived yesterday,\u201d Zuko says awkwardly. He\u2019s used to being on the other side of this interaction, a reverse kind of cultural shock he hadn\u2019t expected. After his banishment, he was a former prince unaccustomed to serving others. And now, he\u2019s a tea server who\u2019s forgotten what it\u2019s like to be served.\nHe takes a sip of his tea and then spits it out.\nPao jumps back. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cThis tea is nothing but hot leaf juice!\u201d\nPao blinks at him. \u201cWell, yes. That\u2019s what all tea is.\u201d\nZuko gapes at him. \u201cHow could you say that?\u201d\nPao looks like he\u2019s going to throw Zuko out even though he\u2019s the only paying customer in the store, until Zuko starts talking about how tea is supposed to be brewed.\n\u201cYou were a tea server?\u201d Pao asks, a keen look in his eye. \u201cWhere?\u201d\n\u201cAll over,\u201d Zuko says, glaring down at the cooling cup of leaf water. \u201cThe Jasmine Dragon never stopped traveling, I guess.\u201d\n\u201cThe Jasmine Dragon?\u201d\nZuko blinks. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard of it?\u201d\nPao looks like he\u2019s about to faint. \u201cOne of my customers mentions the Jasmine Dragon at least once a week. I always wanted to give the owner a talking to, considering how much of my business he\u2019s driven away, just because my tea isn\u2019t like the tea they serve on the Jasmine Dragon. Although...\u201d\nPao studies him. Zuko feels like he\u2019s being sized up for a meal.\n\u201cYou\u2019re new to the city, yes?\u201d Pao says. \u201cHow about we help each other out?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat do you mean you got a job?\u201d\n\u201cNow, Katara,\u201d Sokka says calmly. \u201cA man needs his independence. Zuko should be free to fill his days however he likes.\u201d Sokka pauses. \u201cHow much does this job pay, anyway?\u201d\n\u201cNot much,\u201d Zuko says, shrugging. \u201cLess than I got on the Jasmine Dragon. It\u2019s in the lower ring, so I\u2019m not expecting much.\u201d\n\u201cWhy the lower ring?\u201d Aang asks. \u201cWe\u2019ve all had your tea. And your cooking. You could open up your own place in the upper ring and be a hit.\u201d\n\u201cAnd we\u2019d be rich!\u201d Sokka says.\nZuko looks down at his hands, fiddling with the apron in his lap. It\u2019s not the same kind as the ones they wore on the Jasmine Dragon, but it feels familiar nonetheless.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to stand out,\u201d Zuko says in a soft voice. \u201cI don\u2019t want the attention. Ba Sing Se is \u2026 it\u2019s ...\u201d\nWhen Zuko looks up, his friends are looking at him with gentle expressions and it just reminds him they all witnessed his breakdown the day before. It makes him feel strange. Both relieved and twisted-up all at once. Because they know the truth now and don\u2019t care, but--they still know and that\u2019s more than he knows how to deal with.\n\u201cAny money is going to be helpful when we get moving again,\u201d Sokka says, purposely casual. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019d be much help here anyway. We only need so many hands to put up posters and the Earth King still hasn\u2019t gotten back to us.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe you can ask around about Appa,\u201d Aang says.\nZuko rests a hand on Aang\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best,\u201d he promises.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n((The gaang have enough of waiting and decide to infiltrate the Earth Palace))\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe palace will be packed,\u201d Katara says. \u201cWe can sneak in with the crowd.\u201d\n\u201cWon\u2019t work,\u201d Toph says, throwing herself on the mound of pillows.\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\u201cWell, no offense to you simple country folk, but a real society crowd would spot you a mile away. You\u2019ve got no manners.\u201d\nKatara puts her hands on her hips. \u201cExcuse me? I\u2019ve got no manners? You\u2019re not exactly Lady Fancy-Fingers.\u201d\n\u201cI learned proper society behaviour and I chose to leave it. You never learned anything. And frankly, it\u2019s a little too late.\u201d\nSokka sits up. \u201cBut you learned it! You could teach us.\u201d\nSokka and Aang wrap themselves in blankets, and put on their snobbiest expressions. It doesn\u2019t fool Toph for a moment, even before they bow at the same time, smash their heads together, and almost knock each other out.\nZuko chooses that moment to return from the kitchen with a tray full of tea and biscuits. He ignores Sokka and Aang\u2019s groaning, and kneels down beside the expanse of pillows.\nHis posture is prim and straight-backed, his movements graceful without being too slow. There\u2019s an effortless air to his movements, Toph realises. It\u2019s always been there. It\u2019s in his bending, in his tea brewing, in the way he moves about the world. She\u2019s always felt it, but she\u2019s never been as aware of it as she is now.\n\u201cNow, there\u2019s the man we need,\u201d Toph says, sitting up. \u201cYou commoners couldn\u2019t even pass as bus-boys\u2013and okay, maybe Katara could get in if she was wearing fancy clothes and didn\u2019t speak too much\u2013but Zuko, on the other hand\u2026\u201d\nZuko squirms under everyone\u2019s sudden attention. \u201cWhat did I miss?\u201d\nKatara gasps. \u201cOf course! You\u2019re royalty. You would know how to talk to nobles, especially the Earth King.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the sound of that,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cWhat are you plotting?\u201d\nToph slaps him on the back. \u201cBuck up, Sir Prissy Pants. We have a party to infiltrate.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKatara does Toph\u2019s make-up and helps twist her hair into an elaborate up-do. Katara must be more observant than Toph thought, as it only takes her a few tries to apply the make-up (correctly, if Zuko\u2019s comments are anything to go by). Zuko helps Katara pin her hair in place and fix the hair piece. They all have different hair textures, different cultural upbringings, but Katara has known how to braid since she was a little girl, and Zuko has been living nomadically around the Earth Kingdom for years and has picked up a few styles himself.\nEven with two larger bodies bent over her, fussing with her face and hair, it doesn\u2019t remind her of the servants at the Bei Fong household, the ones who helped her dress every morning and evening, because her parents didn\u2019t believe a blind girl was competent enough to do anything for herself. Katara and Zuko bicker as they work, and they never once ignore her or treat her like a doll to be moved and adjusted. They ask how everything feels. They are careful, but not especially gentle or practiced.\nWhen they\u2019re done, Zuko ducks out so Toph can get changed. Into a dress. The Earth King had better be worth this.\nWhen she\u2019s done, Zuko comes back, and he and Katara stand back, looking at her. The hair, the make-up, the dress\u2013it all feels like a mask, as it always has. But not one she wears to satisfy her parents. This time, it\u2019s a disguise. A weapon. It almost makes the feel of silk and pinchy-hair pieces worth it.\n\u201cYou look beautiful, Toph,\u201d Katara says.\n\u201cYou look like a very pretty, very normal noble,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cIt\u2019s weird. I mean, you\u2019re always pretty, but you always look like Toph. Now you look like someone else.\u201d\n\u201cZuko,\u201d Katara scolds.\n\u201cWhat? She doesn\u2019t look like herself. Isn\u2019t that the whole point of this?\u201d\nKatara whacks him on the arm. Toph ducks behind her fan, feeling warm and seen and validated all at once. It\u2019s a strange, squirmy feeling. Like eating a big meal after being hungry all day. Like being able to lay out in the morning sun after a very cold night.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Toph says, when she feels less like the demure child she\u2019s pretending to be. \u201cZuko\u2019s turn.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKatara slips into the living room. Sokka and Aang are sitting by the pillows playing a game, but they look up when she clears her throat.\n\u201cMay I introduce the young Lord and Lady Bei Fong,\u201d Katara announces.\n\u201cDon\u2019t make us sound married!\u201d Toph shouts from the other room.\n\u201cI meant like siblings!\u201d\n\u201cOh, carry on then.\u201d\n\u201cMay I introduce,\u201d Katara tries again, \u201cthe young Lord and Lady Bei Fong, the respected and annoying siblings.\u201d\nShe pulls the door open. Toph and Zuko are poised in the doorway, dressed in matching robes of sage green and white. Toph is half-hidden behind her fan, curled demurely around Zuko\u2019s supporting arm. Zuko stands tall and graceful as a young sapling, an arm behind his back, his chin held high. Half of his hair is piled atop of his head, held in place with a jade hair pin, while the rest flows loosely down his back.\nThey really do look like siblings, Katara thinks. Toph doesn\u2019t act like a noblewoman normally. She slouches, and burps, and cackles whenever Aang faceplants after a hard day of bending.\nZuko doesn't act like a prince, either. He attends to their meals and drinks, and completes chores with the casual diligence of a server. He ducks his head and shrinks into himself, avoiding attention wherever he can.\nThey were both born and escaped high-society and still hold scars\u2013physically or emotionally\u2013from their childhood.\nZuko looks from Katara to the shocked faces of Sokka and Aang, that worried look back on his face. \u201cDo you think this will work?\u201d\n\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d Katara says. \u201cIt\u2019ll work.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n((They arrive at the ball only to realise they need an invitation.))\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d Zuko hisses.\n\u201cCalm down, firefly,\u201d Toph whispers back. \u201cI can feel how hard your heart is beating. It\u2019s going to be okay. Just think: what would you do if you were at home?\u201d\n\u201cThe Jasmine Dragon is my home.\u201d\n\u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Zuko says, resisting the urge to run through his hair and ruin Katara\u2019s hard work. \u201cWait until someone realised I was missing and hope my dad didn\u2019t hit me too hard when he found out?\u201d\nToph pauses for a moment. \u201cI can\u2019t wait until twinkle-toes Avatar States your dad into the sun.\u201d Zuko laughs breathlessly at her side. \u201cWell, you know what I\u2019d do? This.\u201d\nToph breaks away from the crowd, wandering almost aimlessly until she bumps into a nobleman. She stumbles back, eyes wide. \u201cOh! I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nThe nobleman blinks down at Toph, registering her milky eyes, staring at a point over his shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s quite alright. What are you doing here all by yourself?\u201d\nZuko takes that as his queue to rush over. \u201cToph! Don\u2019t wander off like that.\u201d\nToph latches onto his sleeve and actually sniffles like she\u2019s going to cry. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I just thought you were mad at me for losing our invitations\u2026 Now we won\u2019t be able to find mother and father.\u201d\nZuko grew up with a manipulative little sister. It\u2019s been a long time since he was on this side of it, but he still remembers how to play his part.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Zuko says, trying to sound soothing. \u201cMother and father will notice we\u2019re not at the party\u2026 eventually ...\u201d\nTears well in Toph\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ll get in trouble. You always get in trouble! It\u2019s my fault\u2014\u201d\n\u201cToph, it\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d\nZuko turns to the stunned nobleman. He gathers Toph to his chest, trying to look as young and bewildered as he can. \u201cPlease, sir. Can you help us get into the party? My sister lost our invitations.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Toph cries into his chest, muffled. Zuko shushes her, rubbing circles into her back.\nThe nobleman offers Zuko a handkerchief, which he takes and uses to fuss over Toph, making sure not to smudge her makeup.\n\u201cI\u2019d be honoured. You don\u2019t see such devoted big brothers these days.\u201d\nZuko pauses. He thinks about Azula at the walls of Ba Sing Se, closer than she\u2019s been in years. He stopped writing to her after his first year of banishment. He told himself he didn\u2019t regret it.\nHe\u2019d told himself a lot of things.\nToph makes up for his sudden silence. \u201cThank you, sir. I\u2019m lucky to have Lee to look after me.\u201d\nThe nobleman, Long Feng, turns out to be the Cultural Minister to the king. He also isn\u2019t content to let them go when they enter the party.\nWhile Zuko pretends to scan the crowd for their parents, Toph manages to buy them time. Long Feng asks about Zuko\u2019s scar, and Toph barely misses a beat before launching into a story about how their carriage was attacked one day when they were outside of Ba Sing Se, and Zuko leapt in front of a bandit to defend her. It makes his ears burn.\nHer fake saccharine voice and the shit-eating grin she flashes him whenever Long Feng turns away makes him homesick for someone he hadn\u2019t thought he\u2019d miss.\nWhen Long Feng is pulled into a conversation with another noble, they take the opportunity to sneak away. They find Aang, Sokka and Katara posing as waitstaff.\nKatara glares sharply at them before she realises who they are.\n\u201cThat bad, huh?\u201d Zuko asks.\n\u201cIf another person calls me sweetheart,\u201d Katara hisses back, \u201cI\u2019m going to bend this champagne down their throats.\u201d\nSokka pretends to offer Zuko a crab puff. \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d\n\u201cThe guy who escorted us in won\u2019t let us out of his sight.\u201d\nThey scan the crowd, but suddenly there\u2019s no sight of Long Feng. There is, however, Joo Dee, who looks panicked beneath her plastic smile.\nAang reveals himself to be the Avatar. He comes so close to talking to the Earth King\u2014until the Dai Lee escort them out of the party. Long Feng, the man that escorted them into the party, turns out to be more than just a Cultural Minister.\nMaybe he didn\u2019t buy Toph\u2019s story after all.\nTonight wasn\u2019t a complete waste, however. They find out that the king is a figurehead for the Dai Li and they might never be allowed to talk to him.\nBut they can\u2019t do anything with this information or else they risk getting thrown out of Ba Sing Se and losing their only head in tracking down Appa.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey double-down on trying to find Appa. Or, at least, Aang does. It\u2019s easy to get distracted in this big city with so many winding streets. There are so many things to do and see. So many side-adventures to get caught up in.\nZuko, for his part, enjoys the city during the day. He tells Aang he\u2019s keeping an ear to the ground for information, but he loses himself in the sweet monotony of tea serving. He\u2019s offered a position in the Upper Ring, but he turns it down. The last thing he wants to do is mingle with nobility again, even as a tea server.\nSometimes, when there is a steady stream of customers and his mind is calm, the way it always is when his hands are busy brewing tea, he thinks he could have been happy here. If he was born a tea server instead of a prince, he could have built a life for himself and been content.\nHe tries to shove that thought deep down when he\u2019s around his friends. If he had been born a tea server, just another anonymous face in Ba Sing Se, then his friends would be by themselves, and the thought of anything happening to them scares him almost as much as the thought of never getting to see the Jasmine Dragon again.\nBut at night when the nightmares are close, he unearths that thought and holds it close. He imagines Uncle getting to run a real tea shop in Ba Sing Se. He deserves something big and beautiful, more than just a converted warship.\nDespite his dreaming, this city is not perfect. They\u2019re no closer to finding Appa, and Zuko can\u2019t forget the things he sees in the Lower Ring, on his way to and from Pao\u2019s Tea House. The poverty. The displaced victims of war. The crime. The people who have no way of fighting back.\nEver since meeting Aang, Zuko has lost his ability to ignore the world around him. He has to do something.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n((Enter Blue Spirit stage left))\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re a good fighter. Weird mask, though.\u201d\nZuko sheathes his dao blades and bends down to check the prone figures. They\u2019re just unconscious. No serious wounds.\nJet scoffs when Zuko checks the men\u2019s pulses. \u201cBleeding-heart vigilante, huh? Don\u2019t bother with them. They got what they deserve.\u201d\n\u201cHow old are you?\u201d Zuko tries not to talk when he\u2019s the Blue Spirit, but he\u2019ll be fine. This city is so vast. He doubts he will run into the other boy again.\n\u201cAlmost seventeen.\u201d\nHis age, then. He thought so. \u201cYou\u2019re too old to believe that the world is made up of black and white.\u201d\nJet bristles. \u201cI\u2019m not a child. I\u2019ve been through more than you can imagine.\u201d\n\u201cAre you sure? You don\u2019t know who I am.\u201d Zuko takes a step back, just in case Jet gives in to his reckless anger and attacks him. Just because he snuck out tonight, itching to do something, doesn\u2019t mean he enjoys violence. \u201cThe world isn\u2019t made up of monsters and their victims. Most people aren\u2019t entirely good or evil. It\u2019s all about choices, the kind you make every day. Sure, lots of people don\u2019t choose to change, but if you kill them, you\u2019re robbing them of their chance to grow and become something else.\u201d\nJet\u2019s face is twisted up in a scowl. \u201cSome people don\u2019t deserve the chance to try again. You can\u2019t forget the things some people have done.\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cThe Fire Lord doesn\u2019t deserve a second chance. But how do you know that these people are beyond redemption? You couldn\u2019t.\u201d\nZuko leaves quickly after that.\nHe slips into his bedroom soundlessly. He tucks his mask and black clothes out of sight, and collapses onto his futon, groaning. Why had he said all of that? To a stranger? He\u2019s turning into Uncle.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy do you do this?\u201d Jet asks one night.\nZuko wets his lips. \u201cBecause no one else will. Because these people deserve it, and I feel like I can\u2019t help in any other way. Because it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Jet says, \u201cif we teamed up, we could get a lot more stuff done. Start making a difference around here. I\u2019m a Freedom Fighter. My friends are too, but they don\u2019t want to do anything.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not any kind of Freedom Fighter,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cI just help people when they need it.\u201d\nJet turns away. \u201cHow very righteous of you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to find him,\u201d Aang says in a voice so quiet and dead that Zuko almost doesn\u2019t realise it\u2019s coming from him.\n\u201cOf course we\u2019re going to find him,\u201d Katara soothes.\nToph thumps Aang on the shoulder. He sways with the impact, but otherwise doesn\u2019t react. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to let them run us out of the city. We\u2019ll find him.\u201d\nZuko knows how a realisation can crack the soul in two. When he finally recognised his father\u2019s abuse for what it was, only the desperate efforts of Uncle and the crew had saved him from sinking into despair.\n\u201cAang,\u201d Zuko cuts in, firm. \u201cWe\u2019re going to find him.\u201d\nAang nods, too tired to argue.\nThey inch closer to Aang, huddling around him in solidarity. Between refills of tea, Zuko disappears into the kitchen. He casts one last look at his friends, heart aching, and quietly slips out the window with his mask tucked under one arm.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not hard to find and corner a Dai Lee agent. Zuko has been peripherally aware of them for some time, but he\u2019d always tried to stay away.\nHe\u2019s done playing it safe.\nHe\u2019d thought the Dai Lee agent wouldn\u2019t crack as easily as this one had. Maybe the mask unnerved him. Maybe it\u2019s the dual blades. Maybe it\u2019s the thin layer of rainbow fire flickering on the blades like a mirage, pressed close to the agent\u2019s neck. Whatever it is, it gives him the first proper lead they\u2019ve had since Appa went missing.\nThe maze-like tunnels are dimly lit and smell damp. Lake water and rot and, he realised as he moves deeper underground, the distinct smell of animal fur.\nZuko hears chanting behind closed doors but pushes on. His mission tonight is rescuing the final member of their group.\nThe sight of Appa in chains hurts more than he was expecting it to. Zuko has never been imprisoned and the thought of being cut off from Agni\u2019s light horrifies him. It must be just as bad for Appa, a sky bison, chained deep beneath the earth.\nWhen he closes the door behind him, Appa keens loudly and bucks in the chains, straining to reach him.\nZuko hushes him, slipping off his mask. \u201cYou have to be quiet. It\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll get you out of here.\u201d\nAs soon as Zuko is close enough, Appa licks him with enough force to lift him off his feet. Zuko can\u2019t help but laugh. He\u2019s drenched in slobber and there\u2019s a deranged cult of earthbenders behind him, but he missed Appa. Missed those rumbling noises he makes, the feel of his fur under his palms, the way he pushed into Zuko\u2019s hands when he pet him. Zuko leans in and presses their foreheads together and fights back the hot, tight feeling in his throat.\nWhen he\u2019s sure he\u2019s not going to start trying, he steps back and clears his throat. \u201cLet\u2019s get those chains off you and then we can go home.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Dai Lee try to stop them, but Appa is like a bulldozer, flying up and over\u2013or just through\u2013any attacks. And then they\u2019re soaring up into the air, passing over weathered roofs and sloping buildings. Ba Sing Se is spread out in all directions beneath them, bathed in the soft light of dawn.\nZuko reached Lake Lagai by scaling rooftops, so he\u2019s not too certain how to reach from the air. But Appa barely seems to need any guidance. He beelines for the Upper Ring, flying straight home to Aang.\nThey land in the street in front of their house. Dust billows up around Appa. There\u2019s a sudden shriek from inside the house, following by the stampede of feet.\nThe front door is thrown open. Toph and Katara are open-mouthed in the doorway, Aang standing white-faced behind them.\nZuko raises a hand. \u201cHey, guys. I found Appa.\u201d\nAang barrels down the stairs and launches himself at Appa. He\u2019s crying freely, taking great big gulps between sobs. Appa groans loudly, almost a wail, and shoves into Aang, nosing against every inch of him as if inspecting him for injuries.\nKatara and Toph tumble down the steps. A sleep-rumpled Sokka follows shortly after, rubbing at his eyes blearily.\n\u201cZuko,\u201d Sokka says, awed. \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Zuko says. \u201cIsn\u2019t the whole point of coming to Ba Sing Se to find Appa?\u201d\nZuko jumps off Appa. Katara immediately swoops him into a hug. Toph thumps him on the shoulder, beaming. \u201cYou\u2019re unbelievable, Sparky.\u201d\nWhen Aang has composed himself, he throws himself at Zuko. He stands rigidly, unsure what to do with an armful of sobbing Avatar.\n\u201cNow that we have Appa,\u201d Toph says some time later, \u201cthe Earth Kingdom can\u2019t hold him over us.\u201d She cracks her knuckles, grinning. \u201cLet\u2019s go bag ourselves an Earth King.\u201d\n\u201cHow?\u201d Katara says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t even manage to talk to him when we were inside the palace.\u201d\nSokka\u2019s grin sends shivers down Zuko\u2019s back. \u201cWe do what we did with Zuko.\u201d\n\u201cKidnap him over and over again until he gives up and stops fighting it?\u201d\nAang peaks out from Appa\u2019s fur. His blotchy face is drenched with tears. \u201cKidnapping you was the best thing we ever did.\u201d\nAt the sight of Aang\u2019s puffy face, all Zuko\u2019s bravado drains out of him. He thinks he was ruined the first time he saw that brightly-coloured boy in the moonlit alleyway all those months ago. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nZuko steals into Kuei\u2019s room a few hours before dawn. The Earth King is in bed, cocooned in silk sheets and snoring like an earthquake. Bosco is awake. He blinks lazily as Zuko tiptoes towards the bed.\nWhen Zuko shakes Kuei awake, he squints muzzily at Zuko and then screams. Zuko clamps a hand over his mouth.\n\u201cQuiet,\u201d Zuko whispers. \u201cI\u2019m not here to hurt you.\u201d\nKuei eyes him up and down with obvious doubt. Zuko broke into the king\u2019s chambers in the middle of the night, dressed in dark colours, dao swords strapped to his back, and now he\u2019s smothering Kuei with his palm.\nAang was a much friendlier kidnapper than Zuko.\nZuko slowly pulls his hand back. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for scaring you. I want to show you something.\u201d Kuei\u2019s gaze flicks to his blades. \u201cIt\u2019s not a weapon.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t this wait until morning?\u201d Kuei asks. \u201cPeople are not allowed in the king\u2019s chambers aside from servants and...\u201d\nZuko would bet Kuei was about to say Long Feng. He knows what it\u2019s like to realise that the people close to you can\u2019t be trusted. Kuei is a grown man, but he wonders if he felt anything like Zuko did, thirteen years old and freshly scarred and fumbling through every interaction, trying to reorientate after his life had been turned upside down.\n\u201cLong Feng has been keeping a lot from you,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cAnd not just about the war. You\u2019re the Earth King, but you\u2019ve never even stepped out of your palace. You\u2019ve never seen your people or walked amongst them.\u201d\nKuei settles himself against the headboard, nose turned up. \u201cAnd I should believe what you tell me instead?\u201d\n\u201cNo. You should believe what your eyes tell you.\u201d\nZuko steps away from Kuei. He opens up the balcony doors. The cool morning breeze blows through his hair and catches on his ribbon.\n\u201cYour Majesty,\u201d Zuko says, holding out his hand, \u201chow about we take a little field trip?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn the end, it\u2019s Bosco that helps convince Kuei to go with him. The bear likes him. Zuko doesn\u2019t know why or how this happened and would honestly rather the just-a-bear stay far away from him. But when the bear nuzzles into Zuko\u2019s palm, his fur is warm and soft like Appa, and it makes Kuei think he\u2019s trustworthy. So maybe cuddling the cute abomination is worth it.\nZuko half-carries Kuei as they scale down the palace. It\u2019s clumsy work. Kuei is much heavier and taller than Zuko and he shrieks at every leap.\nIt takes over an hour for them to get to the lower ring. As soon as they move into the city proper, Kuei\u2013dressed in drab brown robes Zuko had borrowed from his manager at the tea shop\u2013looks at everything and everyone with wonder. In the upper ring, he\u2019d seemed so pleased by the empty streets and beautiful buildings. He\u2019d been full of wonder at the sight of the filling streets in the middle ring.\nHis expression sours the closer they get to the wall.\nHe takes in the thin alleyways, shapeless bodies moving in the dim light. The stench of sweat. The thin, patchy roofs and cramped houses. The children, crouched in the dirt, watching Kuei with dark, distrustful eyes. \u201cThis\u2026 this is...\u201d\n\u201cThis is your city,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cThese are your people.\u201d\nKuei only recently learnt about the war. He hasn\u2019t seen the stretches of ash and scorched earth where towns once stood. He hasn\u2019t seen crowds of skinny war orphans beg at ports, or widowers wailing in the street, or veterans learning how to live with newfound disabilities.\nA part of him hates Kuei for that. He\u2019s spent most of his life sheltered in his palace while his people were being ravaged by war.\nHe watches Kuei stumble around his city\u2019s slums in helpless circles, slack-jawed with horror as he sees the truth of poverty for the very first time. Zuko stays close enough to offer protection, but otherwise lets him take it all in silence.\nWhen Kuei begins to look less overwhelmed (and after Zuko has had to steer him away from three would-be muggers), he turns to Zuko and says, \u201cI thought it was just the war that Long Fen was lying about. How could I not know how my people were suffering?\u201d\nZuko thinks for a moment. \u201cWhen you\u2019re being fed beautiful lies,\u201d Zuko begins, choosing his words carefully, \u201cyou want to believe them. It\u2019s easier that way. Denial is better than admitting that your people are in the wrong. That you\u2019re in the wrong.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know,\u201d Kuei says, and he sounds so young.\n\u201cYou know now.\u201d Kuei just looks lost again. Zuko takes him by the elbow, resisting the urge to shake him, and says, \u201cYou\u2019re their king. They need you. Are you going to stick your head back in the sand?\u201d\nKuei looks at him with wide eyes. \u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone like you before. The Avatar showed me the Dai Lee, but it\u2019s his job to maintain peace. But this field trip has nothing to do with the Avatar.\u201d\n\u201cYou should know that your people are suffering.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Kuei agrees, \u201cbut how did you know that I needed to see it? Who even are you?\u201d\n\u201cI was lied to for a long time too,\u201d Zuko admits, fixing his eyes on a shuttered window further down the alleyway. Light spills out around the cracks. \u201cEven after I started seeing the truth, I made excuses and ignored the truth of the war, because I was frightened of what might happen to me if I got involved. It took a while, but my friends helped me see the truth. While I was ignoring the war, good people were suffering, and they would continue to suffer until someone stood up and did something.\u201d\nKuei considers him for a long moment. \u201cYou\u2019d make a good advisor. You wouldn\u2019t happen to be looking for a job, would you?\u201d\nZuko grimaces. \u201cI really don\u2019t think you\u2019d want to hire me.\u201d\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Zuko stays silent, glaring stonily at the thin slat of light emerging from the window. Muffled laughter drifts through the window panel. Kuei sighs. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame I can\u2019t hire someone to be king for me.\u201d\nFirst, Princess Yue. Now, King Kuei. Is this going to be an ongoing theme? Is Zuko going to be collecting repressed royalty the more he travels with Aang?\nThen again, the most repressed royal is Azula and he has no idea how to start with her.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n((Everyone wants to run off in different directions just like in canon. Zuko convinces Sokka AND Katara to go meet up with the Southern Water Tribe. Aang decides to stay in the Earth Kingdom with him rather than hunt down the Guru, as he\u2019s not as desperate to master the Avatar State since he\u2019s closer to mastering all 4 elements now that he has 3 bending masters.))\n((Instead of Katara spotting Zuko in the Upper Ring like in canon, it\u2019s Jet that someone finds out the Blue Spirit\u2019s identity and tracks him down.))\n\u00a0\nWhen Zuko enters the tea shop to tell Pao he\u2019ll be leaving Ba Sing Se in the near future, he finds Jet lounging at one of the low tables, two empty cups and a teapot in front of him. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in a while, Blue.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been busy,\u201d Zuko says, sliding into the bench opposite him.\n\u201cBusy? With the Avatar?\u201d\nZuko winces. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that you knew them. Honestly, I didn\u2019t think it was any of your business.\u201d\nJet turns away, examining the tea shop. He\u2019s still angry, but his anger isn\u2019t focused on Zuko. It\u2019s just an ever-present thing. Directionless. An old wound that never closed, a constant irritation of the soul.\n\u201cI would\u2019ve thought you\u2019d go somewhere more upscale,\u201d Jet says. \u201cThis place is a fucking dump.\u201d\nIt is, so Zuko doesn\u2019t argue, though he is glad Pao is out of ear-shot. The Jasmine Dragon was run out of a small, rusted war ship, the only home a banished prince could afford, but it still hurt when people turned their nose up at it.\nZuko picks up the teapot and pours tea for both of them. \u201cI don\u2019t like the Upper Ring. Everything is so clean and bright, and it feels like everyone is watching you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d love to see it,\u201d Jet admits, though Zuko can\u2019t imagine him rubbing shoulders with nobles--not without throwing their own tea in their face, losing it at the clear wealth disparity. \u201cThough I\u2019d probably go mad up there. It\u2019s not what either of us are used to, right?\u201d\nJet is extending this branch, this shared experience. It\u2019s the closest he\u2019ll ever come to apologising.\nAnd Zuko can\u2019t even relate. Not properly.\nZuko lowers the teapot, carefully thinking over his answer. He hasn\u2019t ever lied to Jet, but he did withhold information. He\u2019s still withholding information. But maybe if he let just a little bit slip through, a hint of who he was \u2026\n\u201cI grew up somewhere like that, actually,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cBy the time I was--forced to leave, I hated it. It wasn\u2019t exactly a kind environment.\u201d\nJet draws back a little, frowning. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say living in the slums, having to fight for every scrap you could get, was a \u2018kind environment\u2019 either.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s true. I never had to live like that, but ...\u201d Zuko shrugs, helpless. How can he describe the violence of royalty? The careful, controlled life of a prince, the knife-edge he walked, constantly in danger of falling, of failing, of catching the full attention of his father, even if that was what he had craved for so long. \u201cThat life would\u2019ve killed me, in the end.\u201d\nJet laughs. It\u2019s not a kind sound, but then, his laughter never is. \u201cIt figures that you used to be some fancy noble. I should\u2019ve realised.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re so--\u201d Jet waves a hand at him.\n\u201cYou just gestured to all of me.\u201d\n\u201cExactly. Weird accent, fine features. That straight way you sit. The more-noble-than-thou air you carry around when you\u2019re the Blue Spirit. Wouldn\u2019t expect a dainty nobleman to have such a mean right hook, though.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not a nobleman. Not anymore.\u201d Not ever. But saying he was once a prince would only make Jet hate him.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Jet says evenly, and he almost looks thrilled. It\u2019s the same way he used to look at Zuko before he found out he knew the Avatar. \u201cYou\u2019re not. Hey, my friends are getting lunch just across from here. You should join us.\u201d\n\u201cYour freedom fighter friends?\u201d\nJet\u2019s scowls, just for a moment, before it\u2019s gone. \u201cThey\u2019ve given up the Freedom Fighter life. For a \u2018fresh chance.\u2019 Whatever that means.\u201d\nIn that moment, shoulders hunched and glaring at nothing, Jet reminds Zuko starkly of himself a few weeks into his banishment, Iroh\u2019s words ringing in his ears, trying to convince himself that his father wanted him to come back, that his banishment wasn\u2019t a life sentence.\n\u201cStarting over can be overwhelming,\u201d Zuko says, careful to make his voice soft without sounding condescending. \u201cBut you shouldn\u2019t pass up the chance to build a new life. You deserve to be happy. Even if you don\u2019t feel like you can be happy here after your old life was--so much more, even if it was also so much worse--you should still try. You deserve that chance.\u201d\nJet stares at him for a long minute, scowling, looking like he so desperately wants to shake off Zuko\u2019s words, but then he blows out a rough breath. \u201cFuck, you sound just like Smellerbee.\u201d\nI sound like my uncle, Zuko thinks, feeling strangely warm at the thought.\n\u201cMaybe if everyone is telling you the same advice, you should listen.\u201d\nJet rolls his eyes and stands up. \u201cYeah, maybe. Are you coming to lunch, or not?\u201d\n\u201cLet me just tell Pao.\u201d\nHe tells the tea merchant he\u2019s heading off with friends now. He\u2019s disappointed to see his best tea server leave for the day, but waves him off without a fight.\nZuko picks up his abandoned tea as he goes and follows Jet out of the door and into the street. Jet is waiting for him. He can see a pair of teenagers dressed strangely, like echoes of Jet, loitering outside the cheap noodle shop down the street. They must be Jet\u2019s friends.\nZuko takes a sip of his tea. Almost spits it out again. It\u2019s so cold.\nWithout thinking about it, Zuko heats the cup between his palms, the way he has warmed a hundred drinks and pots and meals, because his friends have a tendency to get distracted and forget to finish their food and drinks before they cool. Sometimes, Zuko thinks they\u2019ve become too spoilt with a firebender around. After all, Aang can bend fire now, too, but everyone insists that Zuko does it better. Even Aang.\nHe takes another sip. The tea is hot, almost boiling, steam curling into his face like a caress.\nThe tea is knocked out of his hand, and a hook is held at his throat.\nJet\u2019s face is very close, eyes burning. \u201cYou\u2019re a firebender.\u201d\n\u201cWait. I can explain.\u201d Zuko reaches out instinctively, but Jet bats his hands away roughly with the flat side of his hooks.\n\u201cExplain about how you\u2019ve been lying to me? Tricking me? What are you doing here?\u201d\nHe\u2019s gotten too comfortable. He\u2019s always known that Ba Sing Se is dangerous, but after the adrenaline-rush of finding and saving Appa and digging the King Earth out of a well of lies, he\u2019d started slipping.\n\u201cNo trick,\u201d Zuko says slowly. \u201cI\u2019m in the city with my friends. We\u2019re trying to stop the war.\u201d\nJet scoffs. \u201cYeah. Like I\u2019m going to believe that.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m with the Avatar. I\u2019m teaching him firebending. Really, Jet--\u201d\nJet steps back. \u201cYou know Aang? And Katara and Sokka? They\u2019re here?\u201d\n\u201cYou know them?\u201d Zuko echoes.\n\u00a0\n((They\u2019re attacked by the Dai Lee))\n\u00a0\nJet tries to twist out of the hold, but the Dai Lee wrenches his arm back. He chokes, goes down hard.\n\u201cKing Kuei knows the truth about the Dai Lee,\u201d Zuko says, thrashing against the iron fingers digging into his wrists. \u201cI\u2019m friends with the Avatar. They\u2019ll get us out of here--\u201d\nA new voice answers. \u201cThe Avatar?\u201d\nZuko stops. Forgets how to breeze.\n\u201cLet go of me,\u201d Jet shouts, looking past Zuko\u2019s captors. \u201cHe\u2019s the firebender. I haven\u2019t done anything wrong!\u201d\nThis is what it had felt like when Aang had found him in that dark alleyway all those months ago. It\u2019s the sharp tug of an arm around his stomach as he\u2019s hoisted into the air, the weightlessness of being snatched up. It\u2019s looking down at the sinking Jasmine Dragon and knowing the fall would kill him if he struggled.\nAzula looks down her nose at Jet. Her hair is longer than he remembers and she\u2019s lost some of her baby fat, though not all of it, and she looks strange in Earth Kingdom colours but\u2013it\u2019s her.\n\u201cAzula,\u201d he rasps, throat tight, \u201cwhat are you doing here?\u201d\nHe should have known that she wouldn\u2019t give up after his friends stopped the drill outside Ba Sing Se. If Azula wants something, she doesn\u2019t stop until she gets it, no matter the price.\nAzula\u2019s voice is low and smooth and hits him right between the ribs. \u201cI\u2019m here to fix all of your mistakes, Zuzu. Do you think I don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve been up to? Turning on the Fire Nation, helping the Avatar\u2026 I always knew you were a coward, but I hadn\u2019t realised you were a traitor too.\u201d\nZuko swallows hard. \u201cI\u2019m doing this for the good of Fire Nation.\u201d\nAzula laughs. \u201cYou\u2019ve spent too long with Uncle if you\u2019ve actually started believing his lies.\u201d\n\u201cHis lies?\u201d Zuko pushes back against the Dai Lee and tries to stand as tall as he can under Azula\u2019s heavy gaze. \u201cAzula, we grew up with nothing but lies. Have you seen what the Fire Nation has really been doing? There\u2019s no honour in this war. We\u2019re not spreading our culture. We\u2019re destroying the rest of the world and ourselves in the process.\u201d\nAzula almost looks disappointed in him. She brushes hair out of her face, and tells the Dai Lee, \u201cI\u2019ll deal with them later. Put them somewhere they won\u2019t be a bother.\u201d\nThe ground opens up. Zuko is shoved down into the hole and tumbles down a long tunnel, feeling like the earth is swallowing him whole. He\u2019s vaguely aware of Jet shrieking as he\u2019s thrown in after him.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn the glowing catacombs, Zuko huddles against one wall, legs drawn close to his chest. He focuses on keeping his breathing even and tries to stop shaking.\nHe should have convinced his friends to abandon Ba Sing Se the moment he realised Azula was behind the drill. And now Aang and Toph are somewhere in the city, alone, unaware that Azula has infiltrated Ba Sing Se\u2019s walls.\nIt\u2019s been three years since he saw Azula. She\u2019s been alone in the palace, bearing the full brunt of their father\u2019s expectations. Zuko doesn\u2019t know what kind of person she has become.\nMaybe she\u2019ll take him back to the Fire Nation. His banishment is still in place, but maybe she\u2019ll capture Aang, and bring them both back to the Homeland, drag them in front of Ozai, and then--\nA pebble, no bigger than his finger, bounces off his arm. It stings.\nZuko looks up. Jet glares at him from the other side of the cave, holding up another rock. \u201cYou\u2019re freaking out. You need to calm down.\u201d\nZuko shakes his head, because--because--\n((Zuko has a panic attack. Jet gives in and helps him through it. He says he did it because he didn\u2019t want Zuko to get spooked and firebend in the enclosed space, but Zuko admits some things about his past trauma and he can tell Jet is no longer as hostile towards him.))\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAang topples onto the beach, panting and wild-eyed. Katara almost shoves Sokka into the waves in her haste to get to him.\n\u201cThis can\u2019t be good news,\u201d Sokka mutters, following her.\n\u201cThere are Kyoshi Warriors at the Earth Palace,\u201d Aang says. \u201cExcept\u2013except they\u2019re not.\u201d\n\u201cAang, slow down,\u201d Katara says, rubbing a hand over his back. He\u2019s trembling faintly.\nAang shakes his head. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand. I recognised them. And I swear they\u2019re the same Fire Nation girls that fought with Azula.\u201d\nKatara and Sokka exchange wide-eyed glances. It hadn\u2019t escaped Sokka\u2019s notice that Aang was alone.\n\u201cAang,\u201d Sokka says, heart in his throat, \u201cwhere are Toph and Zuko?\u201d\n\u00a0\n((Aang and the siblings run into Toph on the way into Ba sing Se. They\u2019re all super worried about Zuko considering what he\u2019s told them about his family and how badly he\u2019d freaked out when they first ran into Azula at the drill.\nThey also run into Smellerbee and Longshot, also looking for Jet. Katara is Not Thrilled to learn that Jet is in the city too but they decide to all work together to find their boys. They eventually end up finding them - only to also run into Azula.))\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s not too late for you,\u201d Azula says.\n\u201cI\u2019m not helping you capture the Avatar,\u201d Zuko says, hands balled into fists at this side. His palms feel red-hot, flames lingering beneath his skin. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to go back to the Fire Nation. Why would I?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Azula shakes her head. She\u2019s carefully not looking at him, as though Zuko is beyond her notice. \u201cI mean you should leave now while I\u2019m feeling merciful and will still allow it.\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t abandon my friends--\u201d\n\u201cYour stupid little friends are already lost. The Dai Lee will subdue them soon, if they haven\u2019t killed them outright.\u201d Azula waves a hand in the air lazily, cutting off Zuko\u2019s protests. \u201cYes, yes, I\u2019ll put in a good word for you. Maybe they\u2019ll be spared if they comply. But there is no reason for you to join them. Uncle is still out there somewhere, is he not? He\u2019s already lost one son. Would you really force him to lose another one?\u201d\n\u00a0\n((Zuko thinks about leaving and returning to the Jasmine Dragon. He\u2019s homesick and misses Uncle and the crew SO bad, misses that simple but happy life as a tea server desperately. But ultimately he decides that he could not abandon his friends and realises that his previous life is now lost to him, the way his life as a prince had been lost to him so long ago. Zuko fights Azula and is eventually joined by the rest of the gang (+ Jet, Smellerbee and Longshot) and the Dai Lee. Aang still gets hit with lightning. Jet, Smellerbee and Longshot hold off everyone long enough for the gaang to escape with Aang))\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBelow are some snippets I had written for what was going to be my final chapter covering Book 3:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nZuko hasn\u2019t worn all-red in years.\nOn the Jasmine Dragon, Zuko\u2019s wardrobe consisted mostly of browns and yellows and muted greens. The clothes he\u2019d taken from the Fire Nation Palace were too small for him now and not suited for a tea server. And it was difficult to procure red clothing in the Earth Kingdom. Zuko didn\u2019t mind. The Jasmine Dragon was quite obviously a Fire Nation vessel, but customers reacted more favorably when he was dressed in neutral colours.\nHe runs his hands over his cropped red tunic. He\u2019d stolen it from the clothesline of a coastal villager, so of course the quality would be nothing like his royal robes. But it still feels\u2026\nHe snaps a hooded capelet to throw on over his tunic. It wasn\u2019t the elaborate gold finishings he had grown used to as a prince, but the simple yellow thread, stitched with swirls and spikes that reminded him of the flame on the Fire Nation flag, made him feel strangely homesick.\n\u201cCalm down, sparky,\u201d Toph says. \u201cI think you look great.\u201d\nZuko tugs at his high-waisted pants, looser and darker than his tunic. \u201cThank\u2013oh. Very funny.\u201d\nKatara rolls her eyes. \u201cWell, I have functioning eyes and I think you look great, Zuko.\u201d\n\u201cVery Fire Nation-y,\u201d Sokka says with a thumbs up. Zuko examined his friends. Aside from Toph\u2019s green hair-band and Katara\u2019s necklace, the group also looked perfectly Fire Nation. It was almost eerie.\nThey wander into town to replace their foreign accessories. Zuko\u2019s yellow ribbon had been lost in Ba Sing Se, so he found one in a similar canary-yellow shade and tied his hair back in a high ponytail.\nWhen he turns back around, Aang is standing in front of him holding several identical beaded bracelets. He holds one out to Zuko, looking almost shy. \u201cSokka sometimes likes to joke that we should all get matching jackets, but I saw these and thought\u2026 You don\u2019t have to take it if you don\u2019t like jewelry\u2013\u201d\nZuko ties the bracelet around his wrist. There\u2019s only a dozen glass beads on the thread, and he twists them around idly. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of space on the bracelet for more beads. Maybe one day we can add other colours for the other nations.\u201d\nAang swoops in to hug him tightly. Zuko squirms in his hold. He\u2019s just grateful that Aang didn\u2019t sweep them both off the ground and up into the air, like he normally does when he hugs his friends. Such a clear display of airbending in a Fire Nation market would not end well.\nEvery so often, Zuko catches Aang looking down at the bracelets on everyone\u2019s wrists and smiling to himself. He silently decides to never take the bracelet off.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you going to stop him?\u201d Toph asks.\nThey watch, several steps back, as Aang nods to a bewildered man. \u201cFlameo, hotman.\u201d\n\u201cUm,\u201d the man says \u201chello? I guess?\u201d\n\u201cHotman,\u201d Aang says to a passing woman. \u201cLittle hotman,\u201d he says to the child waddling behind her.\n\u201cEventually,\u201d Zuko tells Toph. \u201cLet him embarrass himself for a little longer. A bit of humility is good for the spirit, as my uncle likes to say.\u201d\nToph smirks. \u201cI knew there was a reason I liked you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m going to kill you,\u201d Sokka tells Aang. \u201cI know you\u2019re the world\u2019s last hope and all that good stuff, but--I\u2019m going to kill you. You\u2019ve left me no choice.\u201d\n\u201cSokka, calm down,\u201d Katara says.\n\u201cA school,\u201d Sokka says. \u201cWe\u2019re in enemy territory and he went and enrolled in a school, Katar!\u201d\nZuko hands him a bowl of broth. Sokka sips at it, still glaring at Aang. \u201cThere are worse things he could have done,\u201d Zuko says.\n\u201cAnd it\u2019d be more suspicious if he suddenly disappeared,\u201d Katara agrees.\n\u201cHow are you two on board with this? Aren\u2019t you supposed to be the rational ones?\u201d\n\u201cKatara, rational?\u201d Zuko says, at the same time that Katara says, \u201cZuko\u2019s not rational.\u201d\nThey frown at each other. Off to the side, dangling a wiggling cave-hopper at Momo, Toph snickers.\n\u201cI can be rational,\u201d Katara says.\n\u201cSo can I,\u201d Zuko says.\n\u201cYou\u2019re both disasters that have very passing moments of common sense,\u201d Toph says.\n\u201cNone of us have common sense, clearly!\u201d Sokka waves a hand at Aang, spilling broth down his pant leg. He\u2019s so annoyed he doesn\u2019t seem to notice.\n\u201cSokka, come on,\u201d Aang tries. \u201cEvery minute I\u2019m in that classroom, I\u2019m learning new things about the Fire Nation. I already have a picture of Fire Lord Ozai!\u201d\nZuko hasn\u2019t seen his father in years, and there were no photos of him onboard the Jasmine Dragon, even though paintings of the Fire Lord were customary in many Fire Nation dwellings. He thinks Iroh had seen how uncomfortable Zuko had been with his father\u2019s painting glaring down from him. Maybe it had made Iroh uncomfortable too.\nAang holds up a second picture. \u201cAnd here\u2019s one I made out of noodles!\u201d\nZuko bursts out laughing, a violent sound almost like a sneeze. Ozai\u2019s noodle-face frowns down at him. He chokes on his next wheeze.\nToph thumps him on the back roughly. \u201cYou good, buddy?\u201d\n\u201cOh sorry, Zuko.\u201d Aang lowers the pictures. \u201cI forgot. It must be super weird to see your dad made out of noodles.\u201d\nZuko waves him off. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, Aang. I kind of like it.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s impressive, I\u2019ll give you that,\u201d Sokka says. \u201cBut I still think this whole thing is too dangerous.\u201d\nAang looks off to the side. \u201cI guess we\u2019ll never find out about the secret river, then. It goes right to the Fire Lord\u2019s palace. We were supposed to learn about it in class tomorrow.\u201d\nSokka turns to Zuko, who frowns at Aang. \u201cThere\u2019s no secret river.\u201d\n\u201cThat you know of! Maybe it\u2019s so secret that they didn\u2019t tell you.\u201d\n\u201cSo secret that they wouldn\u2019t tell the Crown Prince, but they would tell a group of schoolkids in an outlying coastal village?\u201d\nSokka looks disappointed at the lack of convenient secret rivers, but remains stern. \u201cThere\u2019s no point in going to school, Aang. We have our disguises. We have Zuko to tell us everything we need to know about Fire Nation culture. There\u2019s no point wasting time and risking our covers just so you can make noodle art about an evil war criminal. No offense, Zuko.\u201d\n\u201cNone taken,\u201d Zuko says.\nAang\u2019s shoulders hunch around his ears. \u201cI\u2019m finally interacting with kids my own age. I know you guys are close to my age too, but--I\u2019m doing it in a normal way. And they\u2019re normal Fire Nation kids! I\u2019m getting to see the side of our enemy I haven\u2019t been able to in one hundred years. They\u2019re people, too.\u201d\n\u201cHumanising the enemy isn\u2019t always a good thing,\u201d Sokka argues.\n\u201cToo late for that, Sokka,\u201d Toph says, poking Zuko in the ribs.\n\u201cToph is right,\u201d Katara says. \u201cWe\u2019re never going to look at the Fire Nation the same way after seeing the Jasmine Dragon and meeting Zuko. And what about when the war is over? Zuko will go back to being a Fire Nation prince, but he won\u2019t stop being our friend.\u201d\nZuko grimaces. It\u2019s weird to think of \u201cgoing back\u201d to being royalty, of slipping back into his role as prince after years of relaxing into his role as a tea server. \u201cLet\u2019s not get too far ahead of ourselves.\u201d\n\u201cSo you both agree with me!\u201d Aang says.\n\u201cNo, I still think this is crazy,\u201d Toph says. \u201cWhy do we need to learn about the Fire Nation when we have Zuko?\u201d\nZuko shifts under their gazes. As uncomfortable as he feels, he can\u2019t get Katara\u2019s words out of his head. When this is over, when he is no longer banished and Ozai is no longer an immediate threat to his well being, would he go home to the Fire Palace? Was that even home to him anymore? \u201cI don\u2019t know everything about the Fire Nation. It\u2019s been three years since I was here. And even before that, I was the prince. I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like in these villages. I don\u2019t know what the rest of the country thinks and feels about--everything. I don\u2019t know what our children are being taught in schools.\u201d\nMaybe, if he knew a little bit more about how his people functioned outside of the Court, he could understand them better. Understand this war. Understand himself.\n\u201cI can\u2019t just go around asking these questions,\u201d Zuko goes on. \u201cIt would be too suspicious, but Aang is in the perfect position to learn how the Fire Nation operates from the inside.\u201d\nSokka sighs. \u201cFine. Fine! We\u2019ll stay a few days, just to make Zuko and Aang feel better.\u201d\nAang jumps into the air, hands up. \u201cFlameo, hotman!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n((Aang convinces them to throw a dance party))\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re going along with this, too,\u201d Sokka grumbles, trailing behind Zuko as he lights the candles scattered around the cave. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be Mr. Cautious, and I\u2019ve heard you whine about music night on the Jasmine Dragon. But you want to help throw a dance party in a cave when we\u2019re fugitives?\u201d\nToph cackles. She\u2019s leaning against a recently erected stone pillar. Zuko just hopes the kids are as unfamiliar with the other forms of bending as he had been at that age, because the cave has clearly been modified with earthbending.\n\u201cMr. Cautious? You mean the guy who ran around Ba Sing Se in a tacky theatre mask?\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t tacky!\u201d\n\u201cThe mask was kind of cool,\u201d Sokka agrees reluctantly. \u201cBut you were so against coming to the Fire Nation. Why are you suddenly all for this?\u201d\nZuko shrugs. \u201cI grew up in the Fire Nation, remember? I know how stifling the lessons can be, how little you learn about the arts and self-expression and just enjoying yourself. If Aang can help these kids unwind for a night, kind of like the Jasmine Dragon helped me unwind, then I think it\u2019ll be worth the risk.\u201d\nAang floats to their side of the cave. The accompanying gush of air almost blows out the candles Zuko had been lighting. \u201cZuko\u2019s right. They deserve a night to cut loose! We\u2019re trying to restore balance to the world. That means helping the Fire Nation, too.\u201d\nSokka groans. \u201cFine. I agree that the Fire Nation needs an overhaul, and I\u2019m all for less murder and more dancing. I just don\u2019t like that we\u2019re doing this in the middle of an enemy nation when we\u2019re still at war.\u201d\nAang laughs, the way he often does when Sokka is this stressed, because he secretly thrives on chaos. He steals a hug from Zuko, snags a cup of tea, and then scampers off to check in with Katara.\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t all die horrible before the war ends,\u201d Sokka says, looking tired again, the way he often does these days, \u201cthen you can throw all the dance parties you want. You can throw one right in the middle of the capital and I\u2019ll be dancing in the streets beside you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not throwing any dance parties, Sokka.\u201d\n\u201cJust you wait. Aang is definitely going to bully you and your uncle into it.\u201d\nZuko grimaces, knowing he\u2019s right.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe sun slips behind the moon at midday. A shiver runs up Zuko\u2019s spine, and the warmth inside him, the fire on a constant low-simmer behind his sternum, goes dark. He fumbles at his robes. His heart beats against his hand, alive and scared, but he still feels like a part of him has been snuffed out.\nWhen he looks up, he finds everyone watching him.\n\u201cTry and bend,\u201d Sokka says.\nZuko tries to draw a flame in his cupped hands. Nothing. He stands, performs a basic kata, one he has been able to do since he was nine years old. Nothing. Even his breath of life doesn\u2019t warm him.\n\u201cIt really does take your bending!\u201d Sokka says. \u201cAlso, Zuko, buddy, I never realised it before, but those bending forms look kind of dumb. It looks good when you\u2019re flinging fire everywhere, but otherwise--\u201d\nZuko sits back down, scowling. Suddenly feeling cold, he shuffles closer to Toph. She smirks at him, but thankfully, no one comments on the clear real reversal of their situation: the firebender seeking warmth from another person.\n\u201cWhat does it feel like?\u201d Katara asks.\n\u201cLike my internal flame has gone out. Like I\u2019m cold and empty and totally powerless.\u201d Zuko makes a face. \u201cIs this what you guys always feel like?\u201d\n\u201cHey,\u201d Toph says from under his arm, \u201cearthbender here. Earthbender who can totally kick your ass.\u201d\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Zuko mumbles. The chill is making him feel achy and tired, like he\u2019s running a fever. He shivers and curls even closer to Toph. She\u2019s radiating heat. He thinks he understands why everyone always shuffles close to him on cold nights.\nKatara gets up and sits on his other side, sandwiching him between them. She puts a hand on his forehead. \u201cYou always run as hot as a camp oven, but now you feel so cold\u2026\u201d\nSokka scowls. \u201cIf the Fire Nation hadn\u2019t prepared so well, this would\u2019ve been the perfect attack. Look at Zuko! The Fire Nation is totally powerless. If only they could stay like that for a while.\u201d\n\u201cFor forever,\u201d Toph says.\nSokka thinks for a moment. \u201cWe can\u2019t take down the sun, right? Although\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSokka!\u201d Katara says. \u201cThat\u2019s what Zhao tried.\u201d\n\u201cI know that! I wasn\u2019t serious. I just think it\u2019d be really helpful if all the evil firebenders magically lost their bending forever.\u201d\nAang stands up so quickly he wobbles and almost falls back down again, clearly not unaffected by the eclipse. Zuko wonders if he would have been as affected before he stoked his inner flame and learnt how to firebend.\n\u201cZuko,\u201d Aang says, eyes so wide they\u2019re almost manic, \u201cthat\u2019s it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n((Field trip to the spirit realm))\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTwenty-four hours have passed since the eclipse and their journey to the spirit realm.\nThree years have passed since Zuko first spoke out against an act of violence against his own people and, in reward, was scarred so deeply that for centuries to come people would see his portraits and recognise him for the rough, red skin warping one side of his face.\nThree years after Ozai cast him out and told him not to come back unless he had the Avatar in tow, Aang bursts into the throne room where Fire Lord Ozai is holding court. He is flanked by his bending masters.\n\u201cFire Lord Ozai,\u201d Aang begins, but stops when Zuko places a hand on his shoulder.\n\u201cFire Lord Ozai,\u201d Zuko says without bowing, without flinching \u201cyou told me to bring you the Avatar, and like a good son, I have done so.\u201d He smiles. \u201cI hope this pleases you.\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t have time to enjoy this moment; twin jets of lightning come at him at once. Aang takes Azula\u2019s, and Zuko catches Ozai\u2019s.\nHe won\u2019t let Ozai hurt him or his friends ever again.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMy plans for this fic:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0"
