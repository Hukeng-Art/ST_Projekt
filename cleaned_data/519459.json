His grumpiness is the stuff of legends.</p>\n<p>So it's obviously the talk of the office when Erik is being made to go to the company party and he's bringing his husband. There's rumors flying round about how much of a masochist or equally antisocial bastard Erik's husband must be to put up with him. Others think he must be a meek mouse perhaps bullied by Erik.</p>\n<p>What they weren't expecting was the confident, charming, adorable and unbelievably nice Charles that turns up on Erik's arm. What they certainly weren't expecting was how much Erik obviously adores his husband and how happy he is to let others see this.</p>\n<p>- </p>\n<p>Based on a prompt from the kink meme.</p>",

    "text": "Erik Lehnsherr is married. \nPeople outside the Engineering Department at Stark Industries, located on the 54th floor of Stark Tower and composed of forty-six of the best engineers in the world, fail to grasp the significance of this statement. \nWhat the outsiders know is that Erik Lehnsherr is widely regarded as one of the best engineers Stark Industries has. Even though he\u2019s a new arrival\u2014hired on six months ago; rumors say that Tony Stark himself ran into Lehnsherr at a job fair and hired him on the spot\u2014he\u2019s already regarded as Stark\u2019s go-to man for the more complicated designs of whatever the hell Stark Industries is involved in at the moment (the projects can change drastically from one week to the next depending on Tony Stark\u2019s moods, which, according to the secretaries on the 86th floor, usually leads to Pepper Potts screaming something along the lines of, \u201cProfits, Tony, profits!\u201d to which Stark declares, \u201cI work for the good of society!\u201d and then proceeds to spend five hundred thousand dollars on a new car). \nWhat the outsiders don\u2019t know is that Erik Lehnsherr is possibly the most frightening individual they will ever come across. Ever. He shuts himself in his office for most of the workday, and when he emerges, it is only to fetch the bland coffee from the break room (this is Stark Industries, you\u2019d think there\u2019d be decent coffee), run across the street for a sandwich at the nearby diner, or visit the restroom. He barely speaks to anyone, and when he does, he always looks half a second away from snapping at everyone in range. Apparently, nothing anyone does is ever good enough for Erik\u2019s standards; when the project leaders present their progress, he always points out mistakes, criticizes mercilessly, and sends everyone back with more instructions heaped on. He\u2019s the definition of a perfectionist, which is bad enough, but a mean perfectionist? It\u2019s hell. \nHe\u2019s also got this awful smile that belongs either on Shark Week or in a museum, preserved for posterity to scare little children when they don\u2019t eat their vegetables or some other shit. That smile is terrifying, perhaps the most terrifying part about Erik Lehnsherr. Sometimes he says something that\u2019s not humorous in the slightest, and then follows it up with that horrendous grin that is probably an exhibit at Ripley\u2019s Believe It or Not, filed under the heading \u2018Holy shit, is it possible to smile with that many teeth, and is it possible that that smile means anything other than intense homicidal intent, help.\u2019 \nHis coworkers have attempted to draw him out of his isolation. \u201cHe\u2019s shy,\u201d Moira declares. \u201cHe probably needs some encouragement from us, to help him open up.\u201d \nShe goes to invite him to lunch one day and returns pale and wide-eyed, shaking her head. \n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Sean asks, leaning forward at his desk. His cubicle has become the unofficial Erik Lehnsherr Rumor Center, mostly because he makes up the most random, scary shit that might actually be true because this is Erik Lehnsherr and no one has any idea what to expect. \nMoira shakes her head again. \u201cHe is definitely not shy. That\u2019s not it.\u201d She shudders a bit. \u201cI knocked on his door and asked him if he wanted to grab a bite, and he said, totally straight-faced, \u2018A bite of what?\u2019 and then smiled at me\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSmiled?\u201d Alex says, shivering. \u201cWas it horrible?\u201d\n\u201cIt was horrible,\u201d she confirms. \u201cHe seemed to think it was hilarious, and he just\u2014he just kept grinning, and I had to get out of there. So I did.\u201d \nThe others don\u2019t blame her; Erik\u2019s horror-face-that-passes-for-a-smile is something they prefer not to face. They\u2019d rather lick sandpaper, or piss Emma off, or attend one of those insanity kicks Tony Stark likes to call \u2018company retreats.\u2019 \n(They aren\u2019t company retreats, by the way\u2014or at least, they aren\u2019t one in any conventional sense. They involve keg stands, strobe lights, and a horde of women, which would be totally fine except Tony Stark inevitably shows up and forces everyone into what he calls \u2018bonding exercises,\u2019 usually involving heights and usually a good form of torture that the military should consider employing against enemies of the state. The things Stark\u2019s brilliant mind comes up with are, frankly, alarming and probably illegal. Most of the Engineering Department calls in collectively sick on company retreats days. Tony Stark, as of yet, hasn\u2019t called them out on it; he seems to think they\u2019re just missing a great party, when in reality, they\u2019re dodging bullets. Multiple, Tony Stark-shaped bullets.)\nThey try in vain to invite him out to drinks after work, but he usually stays behind much later than they do, and he always turns them down, gruffly citing previous engagements. The general consensus is that that is utter bullshit, because there is no way he has previous engagements every day for two weeks, which was about as long as the Engineering Department gave him until they decided to throw in the towel. Erik Lehnsherr is just an antisocial bastard who hates humanity and probably goes home to skin turtles or something, because that seems like something a guy with a smile that does for fun. \nAnyway. Never let it be said that the Engineering Department didn\u2019t at least try to understand Erik Lehnsherr. Let it only be said that Erik Lehnsherr is impossible to understand, and that any effort to try to prove otherwise will result in that maniacal grin and possible dismemberment. (And dismemberment is, in fact, a possibility. Underestimating Erik would probably be unwise.) \nThe whole point of this is actually two points. \nPoint number one: Erik Lehnsherr is a cantankerous, grumpy, evil, shark-faced bastard of a boss. \nWhich leads directly to point number two: Erik Lehnsherr\u2019s husband has got to be either a) the biggest masochist in the good ol\u2019 U.S. of A (and possibly in the world), or b) an equally cantankerous, grumpy, evil shark-faced bastard (which terrifies the crap out of ninety-five percent of the department, because imagining someone worse than Erik is the stuff of nightmares), or c) a shy as hell, easily dominated, luckless fool who had the misfortune of catching Erik\u2019s eye. \nThe fact that Erik is married is shocking enough. Imagining who the hell would be able to put up with him, who would actually agree to marry someone like Erik, is mind-boggling. Both the identity and the nature of Erik\u2019s husband is a source of endless speculation in the office. Six months in, and they know next to nothing about this mysterious husband; all they know is that Erik has a wedding band on the fourth finger of his left hand and that Erik sometimes gets phone calls around lunch time that bring out that creepy shark-smile. \nPlus, there\u2019s the flowers that show up randomly on Erik\u2019s desk, always with a card, and that narrows the options down\u2014Erik\u2019s husband has got to be Erik\u2019s polar opposite because no one can imagine Erik sending flowers to anyone, except maybe if they were poisonous and maybe if they were monstrous and man-eating with teeth as sharp as Erik\u2019s. \nThe rumor mill grinds on interminably. Even Raven, who is notoriously good at figuring out every little embarrassing detail about anybody, comes up empty. Another month passes, and the entire office figures that it\u2019s about time to give up. They\u2019ve exhausted the topic, and if a seven-month investigation has gone on fruitlessly, the question will probably never be solved. \nThen, bright and early one Monday morning, Emma Frost glides up to Sean\u2019s desk where the usual group has gathered, tasteless coffee in hand, rubbing sleep out of their eyes.\n\u201cDid you see the memo?\u201d she asks no one in particular. \n\u201cWhat memo?\u201d Darwin asks. \n\u201cThe memo. The memo. Stark\u2019s thing about the company party next Saturday.\u201d \n\u201cOh, that,\u201d Raven says. \u201cCelebrating the 50th anniversary of blah-blah-blah. What about it?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s mandatory,\u201d Emma informs them all coolly. \nAlex slurps his coffee. He prefers to drink like a barbarian, thank you very much, no matter how many dirty looks people in neighboring cubicles send him. \u201cSo\u2026?\u201d \n\u201cSo Erik is required to come.\u201d \n\n\u201cSo\u2026?\u201d\n\nShe rolls her eyes, elegantly. Everything Emma does is elegant. \u201cAlso, I\u2019ve been put in charge of handling the Engineering Department\u2019s invitations and RSVP list, since Erik isn\u2019t the party-planning type, as you can imagine. As such, I have full access to all the details.\u201d\nShe pauses dramatically, waiting for them all to stop sipping their coffee and pay attention. When she\u2019s got eye contact with half the group\u2014which, at this point in the morning, is the most focus she\u2019s likely to get\u2014she says airily, \u201cErik marked himself down as plus-one.\u201d \nAll of them freeze for a moment. Then Raven exclaims, \u201cWhat?\u201d at the same time Sean says, \u201cNo fucking way,\u201d and then they all stare at Emma, wide awake and grasping for details. \nShe smiles smugly at all of them. Power\u2019s always been her favorite thing in the world, and she uses it now with pleasure, enjoying the way everyone looks on eagerly as she slowly opens her mouth and licks her lips. \u201cWell\u2026\u201d \n\u201cCome on, don\u2019t hedge,\u201d Raven says impatiently, leaning forward against the cubicle wall. \u201cDoes this mean\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s bringing his husband,\u201d Emma confirms with a sharp grin. \u201cOn the plus-one, he wrote Charles Xavier.\u201d \nAlex pounces on that immediately. \u201cFinally, a name. Seven goddamn months and we finally figure out the guy\u2019s name. Jesus, Erik\u2019s a tight-lipped bastard.\u201d \n\u201cHow do you know it\u2019s his husband?\u201d Hank interjects softly. He\u2019s a timid kind of guy, quiet but brilliant. Everyone knows Alex has a crush on him roughly the size of Pluto that has been going on for ages now, but Hank is oblivious and whatever, it\u2019s not the office\u2019s job to fix relationships anyway. It\u2019s much more fun to watch Alex bumble around trying to do nice things for Hank and then invariably fucking it up, mostly because he\u2019s just absolute shit at the romantic things and can\u2019t express his feelings properly without sounding like he\u2019s utterly furious.\n\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d Angel puts in. \u201cDifferent last names.\u201d \n\u201cFirst of all,\u201d Emma says archly, \u201cwhy would he take someone to a company party who\u2019s not his husband? Second of all, who else would it be? A friend?\u201d\nThey exchange glances and nod in singular agreement. Erik doesn\u2019t have any friends, it\u2019s against his genetic code or something. So this Charles person has to be his husband. \n\u201cOkay,\u201d Raven says, chewing on her bottom lip. \u201cOkay. So we\u2019ll finally get to see who it is, right? This is a good thing.\u201d \n\u201cA good thing? What if his husband\u2019s exactly the same as he is?\u201d Sean\u2019s eyes widen as a thought strikes him. \u201cTwo Erik Lehnsherrs?\u201d\nThey all shudder violently. One is bad enough; two together would probably wipe out the entire Engineering Department, plus some of the Physics Department on the floor below. \n\u201cStill,\u201d Raven defends after a moment, \u201cwe get to see him. See who\u2019s right. He can\u2019t be exactly like Erik. That wouldn\u2019t be possible.\u201d \nThey think on that for a moment, imagining two Erik\u2019s. The thought is too horrifying to stomach, so when Darwin says hastily, \u201cWell, we\u2019ll just see on Saturday, won\u2019t we?\u201d they gladly end the conversation then and there.\n\n *\nOn Friday afternoon, the door to Erik\u2019s office opens, and out he steps, coat on, briefcase in hand. As one, everyone looks at their clocks: five-fifteen. A full hour before everyone else gets off. Erik Lehnsherr never leaves this early. This is radical. This is a break from a seven-month-long routine. This is unbearably intriguing. \nRaven gets up casually from her desk and meanders over to where Erik is standing by his office as he loops a scarf around his neck. Everyone else in listening distance rises slightly in their cubicles, standing tall enough to watch but still low enough to be able to duck back if Erik turns his gaze their way. \nRaven\u2014being Raven, probably the boldest girl (or guy) in the entire office, with the exception of Emma\u2014gets right to it. \u201cLeaving early today?\u201d she asks sweetly, managing to strike the delicate balance between offhanded and rabidly interested. \nErik looks at her. At least he\u2019s not scowling, Sean thinks from two rows over. There\u2019s that. \n\u201cYeah,\u201d he says slowly, as if he\u2019s surprised Raven\u2019s approached him at all. \u201cI\u2019m going to dinner.\u201d \nRaven\u2019s smile widens. \u201cOh! With anyone?\u201d \nErik gives her a strange look, probably because her curious smile is turning a little manic. \u201c\u2026Yes. With my husband.\u201d \n\u201cYour husband,\u201d Raven repeats. \u201cI heard,\u201d she adds casually, \u201cthat you\u2019re going to the company party tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Erik confirms brusquely. \u201cWhat about it?\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Raven continues, undeterred by his tone, \u201ca little bird told me\u2014\u201d\nErik\u2019s eyes narrow. \u201cFrost.\u201d\n\u201c\u2014a little bird told me that you\u2019re bringing a guest.\u201d Raven bats her eyelashes. That usually works on no one but Hank, and that\u2019s only because Hank\u2019s been crushing on her just as hard as Alex has been crushing on him. Yes, this is a respectable office in Stark Industries. No, this is not a mid-afternoon soap opera. \n\u201cWhat about it?\u201d Erik asks, beginning to walk. He\u2019s got the longest fucking legs in existence, and one of his bastard things is to walk approximately at the speed of a charging rhino\u2014which is to say, about forty miles faster than anyone else, which means walking beside him requires some good cardio and determination. \nRaven\u2019s got both. She keeps up, barely, and says, \u201cWell, that\u2019s nice of you. To bring him to a company party, I mean.\u201d \n\u201cHe insisted,\u201d Erik says flatly. \u201cHe wanted to see where I work.\u201d \n\u201cOh!\u201d Raven exclaims brightly, seizing that bit of information and storing it away in the archive of her mind labeled \u2018Charles Xavier, mystery man.\u2019 \u201cThat\u2019s cool of him. So, you\u2019re headed to dinner with him now?\u201d\nHe shoots her an irritated glance and answers, \u201cYes, and I\u2019m already late. Excuse me.\u201d \nRaven ignores him. \u201cWhere do you guys like to eat? What\u2019s Charles into?\u201d \nErik stops so suddenly that Raven overshoots him by three steps and has to backtrack. \u201cYou know his name?\u201d he demands. \nRaven looks at his unreadable expression. This is unfamiliar territory, because Erik is scowling 99% of the time and smiling horribly the other 1%. Never unreadable, like he is now. He might be trying to look interested. He might also be contemplating drowning puppies in his toilet. \n\u201cYes\u2026\u201d she says slowly, unsure of what he means by that. \u201cEmma. Last week\u2026\u201d \nHis lips start to turn up. Teeth are beginning to show. \u201cSeven months sneaking around and you\u2019ve only just discovered his name?\u201d He cracks a grin. It is unsurprisingly terrifying. \u201cYou\u2019re a really poor detective, aren\u2019t you? Almost as poor as your midterm reports are.\u201d \nHe laughs, and Raven stands there for a moment, half-hoping he chokes and dies on his insult. \nHe doesn\u2019t. \nWhen he\u2019s sufficiently recovered from laughing at his own cleverness, he sobers up and says abruptly, \u201cGo back to work. You\u2019ve got a report due Monday, and I expect it to be color-coded. Don\u2019t forget like you did last time.\u201d \nWith that, he takes his leave, striding out with all the asshole indifference he has. Raven returns to her desk and resists the urge to shred every single color-coded sticky note she has.\n\n*\nEven if it\u2019s loud and boozy, everyone is still in suits and dresses, because Tony Stark insists on formality at the oddest times. Raven has donned a purple dress that has Hank following her like the love-struck puppy he is. Alex and Sean have cleaned up nicely, which is a surprise because no one had thought they even owned suits. Emma\u2019s glittering white dress draws everyone\u2019s eye with every movement she makes. She dazzles with her ostentatious entrance, and then proceeds to capture and recapture attention as she weaves her way through the lobby. \nNo one spots Erik. Not yet, at least. \nThen, at seven-thirty, half an hour after the party opens, Darwin pops up where their group is congregating near the side wall underneath the massive portrait of Howard Stark. \u201cSaw Erik,\u201d he announces. They\u2019re still in the lobby, not in the ball room where the music is currently blasting away, so he doesn\u2019t have to shout. \u201cHe walked in a minute ago.\u201d \nRaven whips her head toward the doors. \u201cWhere? Where\u2019s Charles Xavier?\u201d\nDarwin shakes his head. \u201cHe was alone when I saw him.\u201d \nSean groans. \u201cOf course. Should\u2019ve known it was too good to be true. Hey, do we even know if this guy even exists?\u201d\nThey all consider that for a moment. \n\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Raven says slowly. \u201cWe don\u2019t.\u201d Because no one has ever seen even a picture of Erik\u2019s husband; the only evidence that he exists is the silver wedding band on Erik\u2019s finger. \n\u201cHe can\u2019t be faking,\u201d Hank disagrees. \u201cHe goes out to dinner with him\u2026doesn\u2019t he?\u201d \nOnce the idea has been raised, none of them can forget it. \u201cHe could be lying about that,\u201d Alex points out. \nHank furrows his brow. \u201cWhy? That serves no purpose.\u201d \n\u201cIt serves the purpose of making him seem less like a lonely, antisocial prick,\u201d Alex says dryly. Then he reconsiders and corrects himself, \u201cWell, it would make him seem less like an antisocial prick, if he wasn\u2019t constantly reaching epic levels of dickery.\u201d \n\u201cHe can\u2019t have made it all up,\u201d Raven says, shaking her head. \u201cEmma saw\u2014the guest list\u2014\u201d\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Sean interrupts. \u201cMaking up names is the easiest thing in the world. He\u2019s like one of those guys who can\u2019t handle the fact that no one likes him and makes up an imaginary friend, right?\u201d \n\u201cDo those people even exist?\u201d Alex asks, sounding moderately creeped-out. \n\u201cDid you think people like Erik Lehnsherr existed before you saw him?\u201d Sean counters. \nThey chew on that in silence for a moment. \nThen, out of nowhere, a smooth voice, sharply accented, asks apologetically, \u201cExcuse me for crashing your little party here, but could any of you tell me where to find the Engineering Department?\u201d\nAs one, they all swivel to find a handsome young man on the edge of their circle, impeccably dressed in probably the best tuxedo in the house, complete with a perfectly tied bowtie. He looks much too elegant to be a part of anything Tony Stark-related. He looks like he belongs in a high-society fundraiser, the ones that take place in mansions with multi-billionaires who sleep on beds of gold and have cheetahs and giraffes as pets. \n\u201cThe\u2026\u201d Sean repeats slowly. \n\u201cEngineering Department,\u201d the young man repeats pleasantly. \u201cI was told this was a multi-department party. I\u2019m trying to find the general area of the Engineering Department.\u201d \nEmma steps out of their circle and approaches the stranger with a conspicuously seductive spring in her stride. As naturally graceful as she is, she\u2019s the only one who looks like she belongs in the same room with The Tux. \n\u201cHello,\u201d she nearly purrs, and Raven and Angel stare because Emma considers flirting beneath her level\u2014she prefers to be the pursued rather than the pursuer. But in cases like these, with a man who looks like he\u2019s wearing a ten-thousand-dollar suit, she makes exceptions. Apparently. \n\u201cHello,\u201d The Tux returns with a bright-white smile. Seriously, his teeth are so fucking white and pretty that Sean reaches reflexively for sunglasses. \u201cCan you help me?\u201d\n\u201cI can do more than that,\u201d Emma says, her voice sultry, and Alex is pretty sure he has never heard such an obvious come-on in his life. \n\u201cThis is the Engineering Department,\u201d Moira cuts in quickly, before Emma leaps on The Tux and mauls him. \u201cOr part of it, at least.\u201d \n\u201cOh.\u201d The Tux sounds relieved. \u201cGood. I\u2019ve been wandering around for a while now. There are so many people here.\u201d \nThere really are. There are rumors that Stark reconstructed the lobby and ball room not to accommodate the monthly expertise conferences but for the parties. Knowing Stark, those rumors are probably true. \n\u201cCome join us,\u201d Emma offers, taking his arm and drawing him into their circle. \u201cWhere are you from? I\u2019ve never seen you around before.\u201d \n\u201cI don\u2019t work here. I\u2019m waiting for someone,\u201d The Tux explains, joining them. \u201cI got here later than I intended. Work got in the way.\u201d \n\u201cWork always gets in the way of fun here,\u201d Sean groans. \u201cGod, you\u2019d think Erik would have better things to do than kill us every day with paperwork.\u201d \nNone of them notices The Tux\u2019s eyes lighting up. Instead, they\u2019re wholly focused on the subject of bitching about Erik now, since it\u2019s one of the only things a disparate group like them has in common. \n\u201cDid you know what he told me last week?\u201d Alex complains. \u201cHe said that my report lacked details. Details, really? I wrote a fucking thesis for that report. It was, like, twelve pages long. I had bullet points.\u201d \n\u201cAnd when I tried to invite him out for drinks after work,\u201d Moira adds, \u201che told me, \u2018Don\u2019t you have work to do? That survey I gave you is due tomorrow afternoon.\u2019 As if I didn\u2019t already know that.\u201d \n\u201cI was about to go home the other day,\u201d Angel chimes in, \u201cand he walked by my desk and gave me thirty pages of reading that I was supposed to look over and annotate by the next morning. Honestly. It\u2019s as if he thinks we never sleep, or eat, or do anything besides work.\u201d\n\u201cProbably because that\u2019s all he does,\u201d Raven sniffs. \n\u201cThat, and going out with his mysterious husband who may or may not exist,\u201d Sean says. \u201cSeriously, has anyone seen either Erik or his nonexistent husband yet?\u201d\nThey all turn to look around at the crowd, and at that moment, Erik appears out of nowhere, scaring the crap out of Sean, who leaps nearly a foot into the air. \n\u201cJesus,\u201d he breathes, holding a hand against his heart. \u201cErik. Didn\u2019t see you there.\u201d \nErik ignores him. Instead, he circles around the group and oh-so-casually slips an arm around The Tux\u2019s waist. \u201cHi,\u201d he says, pressing a kiss against The Tux\u2019s cheek. \nEveryone stares. The Tux smiles and says, \u201cHello, love. Sorry I\u2019m late, the lab ran longer than expected.\u201d \nHoly shit. Holy shit. If ever there was a situation to warrant an emphatic \u2018holy shit,\u2019 this is it. This is it times a thousand. No one says a word. This is impossible. Erik\u2019s husband is supposed to be some sadistic, creepy, evil-eyed monster, just like Erik is. Or he\u2019s supposed to be this timid, scrawny, frightened little rabbit of a thing. He\u2019s not supposed to be this gorgeous, red-lipped, bright-eyed guy armed with a charming smile, a killer fashion sense, and a polished English accent. He\u2019s not supposed to look remarkably well-adjusted, or like a generally nice guy, or\u2014freakily enough\u2014happy. \nHow the hell does one get married to Erik fucking Lehnsherr and be happy about it? \nNo. Raven\u2019s shaking her head, expressing the unspoken sentiment of the whole group. Darwin is staring, looking utterly confused. Sean has yet to pick his jaw up from the floor. This can\u2019t be Erik\u2019s husband. This can\u2019t be\u2014\n\u201cCharles Xavier,\u201d The Tux says with a wide grin at them all. \u201cI\u2019m Erik\u2019s husband. It\u2019s very nice to meet you all. Although,\u201d he laughs, \u201cmaybe I\u2019m in the wrong place. Erik, you don\u2019t seem to have very many fans here.\u201d \nThey all cringe, expecting Erik to turn his glare on them. That glare could cut glass, and all of them have had the misfortune of experiencing it. None of them wants to relive that experience again. \nBut Erik doesn\u2019t even so much as glower. Instead, he looks almost abashed as he mutters, \u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d \n\u201cComplicated,\u201d Charles repeats with a chuckle. \u201cEveryone seems to think you\u2019re positively draconian.\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m not that bad,\u201d Erik tries, sounding much nicer than he\u2019s ever sounded to any of them. \nThat\u2019s such a blatant lie that Raven can\u2019t help but blurt, \u201cErik, sorry, but you\u2019re a dick.\u201d \nTwo seconds later, she realizes exactly what she\u2019s said, and to whom she\u2019s said it to, and\u2014oh, shit, shit, shit\u2014mentally prepares herself for a verbal pink slip, right then and there. \nEveryone stares, wide-eyed and nervously expectant, at Erik. \nInstead, it is Charles who says, puzzled, \u201cWhat are you talking about? Erik\u2019s one of the nicest guys I know.\u201d \nThat makes them stare at him. Is he absolutely, positively joking? He\u2019s got to be joking. But he\u2019s got the straightest face they have ever seen. Seriously. It\u2019s straighter than Erik\u2019s spine, which is saying something because that bastard\u2019s got the straightest posture in probably the entire building. That\u2019s 86 floors. That\u2019s saying something. \nCharles surveys their expressions and realizes they don\u2019t believe him. He looks honestly surprised to realize this. \u201cI\u2019m not lying,\u201d he says slowly. \u201cErik is truthfully a very nice guy.\u201d He looks over at his husband. \u201cRight? Erik?\u201d \nErik averts his gaze. \u201cWell\u2026\u201d \nCharles\u2019s bright smile falters. \u201cErik? How many times have we talked about being sociable? And polite?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026try,\u201d Erik mutters. \n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t,\u201d Alex announces, growing bolder every moment Erik doesn\u2019t lunge at any of them. It seems like Charles is actually keeping Erik in line, which\u2014let\u2019s face it\u2014probably no one else on earth could do. Alex intends to take complete advantage of it. \u201cHe criticizes everyone, no matter what.\u201d \n\u201cYeah,\u201d Raven says, catching some of his bravery. \u201cAnd he makes us redo reports if there\u2019s even one typo.\u201d \nAngel nods. \u201cAnd when we ask him out after work, he always refuses.\u201d \n\u201cAnd when it was Moira\u2019s birthday last month,\u201d Sean adds, \u201che told us to cut the party short and get back to work.\u201d Moira nods in agreement at that. \n\u201cHe makes me rewrite every single paper,\u201d Darwin says. \u201cEvery single time.\u201d \nEmma Frost sniffs. \u201cSorry, sugar,\u201d she says, directing her words at Erik, \u201cbut you are a cruel taskmaster.\u201d \nThey all look expectantly at Hank, who never likes to complain but there\u2019s no way anyone works under Erik and harbors no complaints. After a moment of hesitation, he says in embarrassment, \u201cHe makes me talk any time we\u2019re in the conference room, even when he knows\u2014\u201d he hesitates again, glancing furtively at Erik, then finishes in a rush, \u201c\u2014even when he knows I hate it.\u201d \nCharles looks surprised. \u201cErik, what are you doing to these poor people?\u201d\n\u201cI have my reasons,\u201d Erik says defensively, which marks the first and only time any of them have seen Erik on the defensive; he\u2019s always so frighteningly aggressive. \n\u201cWell, let\u2019s hear them,\u201d Alex says brashly. He\u2019s going to keep pressing as long as they seem to be on equal footing. Then, if it seems like Erik\u2019s about to snap, he\u2019s going to leap back and cut his losses before Erik can take his head off\u2014literally. \n\u201cI only criticize you to make you better,\u201d Erik says slowly. \u201cYou all need to get better in order to move up the ladder. Stark Industries, any of the top companies\u2014they all have very high standards. Raven, even one typo makes you unprofessional. And the sticky-notes thing\u2014if you can\u2019t follow simple orders, no one will want you. I was trying to\u2014to teach you to take orders.\n\u201cDarwin,\u201d he adds, \u201cyou write good reports. But I want you to write excellent reports. You have the potential, and I knew you could do better. That\u2019s why I made you write them over again. \n\u201cAnd about Moira\u2019s birthday\u2014the project we were working on was due the next morning, and none of you had done enough to finish it. Stark came around asking me about it, and I promised we\u2019d meet the deadline. I didn\u2019t want to break that promise.\n\u201cHank, you know how bad you are at confidence. Building up your self-esteem is something you need to do if you ever want to get promoted. That\u2019s why I make you talk every time, for practice.\n\u201cAnd about the invitations to go for drinks\u2014I always eat dinner with Charles, every day. I wasn\u2019t lying about anything,\u201d he finishes, looking vaguely contrite. \nAll eight of them stare incredulously at Erik. That is, without a doubt, the most they have ever heard him talk in any amount of time, and he sounds\u2014dare they say it\u2014rational. Nothing like the perpetually angry, terrifying prick they\u2019ve seen for seven full months. \nWhat\u2019s even more astonishing is that he actually sounds like he\u2019s trying to help them out. By being strict as hell and arming himself with a smile that makes him look more than a little deranged, he\u2019s been trying to make them better.\nIn the stunned silence, Charles says, looking faintly worried, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to have dinner with me every day, darling. I don\u2019t want to keep you from making friends.\u201d \nErik looks at him. \u201cI want to eat with you. And none of them\u2014\u201d He glances around. \u201cI just thought I wouldn\u2019t be very welcome. I thought\u2026I didn\u2019t think that was what you all thought about what I was doing. I didn\u2019t know that was why you were avoiding me.\u201d \nTo their shock, he actually sounds sincere. And he didn\u2019t know? How on earth could his actions have labeled him as anything other than absolute douche, and what other possible reason could they have for being scared shitless of him? Honestly. Honestly.\n\u201cI tell you to be nice,\u201d Charles sighs. \n\u201cI am. I talk. I\u2026joke.\u201d \nUnable to help herself, Raven barks a laugh. \u201cWhat? When?\u201d\n\u201cAll the time,\u201d he says solemnly, and that is when they realize collectively that, holy crap, Erik actually thinks the things he says are jokes, not insults, and he\u2019s actually trying to be funny with them. Insults from friend to friend? Acceptable. Even funny. If only all of them had known Erik was trying to be their friend, not trying to tear apart their pride and dignity with a single sentence. \n\u201cThat\u2014\u201d Sean chokes. \u201cWhen you\u2026do that freaky smile thing\u2026\u201d\nErik frowns. It\u2019s more confused than condemning. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2014that freaky\u2014\u201d Sean tries to demonstrate, baring all his teeth, curling up his lips. He fails miserably, closer to looking like someone smacked him in the face with a two-by-four than Erik\u2019s horrifying grin. \nErik shocks them again by looking a bit crestfallen. \u201cI\u2014Charles always said\u2026\u201d \n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a beautiful smile, darling,\u201d Charles assures him. \u201cIt just takes some getting used to.\u201d He flashes them all his own charming grin\u2014a dozen, dozen, dozen times more pleasant than Erik\u2019s grimace. \u201cTake it from a guy who has some experience in that department.\u201d \nErik still looks unsettled. \u201cDoes no one really get my jokes?\u201d\nCharles sighs. \u201cErik\u2019s got a wonderful sense of humor,\u201d he tells them all. \u201cIt just takes special people to understand it.\u201d \n\u201cYou told me I was funny,\u201d Erik complains, narrowing his eyes at Charles. \n\u201cYou\u2019re hilarious.\u201d Charles gives him a conciliatory kiss on the corner of his lips, tiptoeing to reach. \u201cReally.\u201d \nErik sighs. He says after a moment, clearly still preoccupied with what they\u2019ve said, \u201cAre you thirsty or hungry, schatz?\u201d\n\u201cA water would be fine, thank you,\u201d Charles answers. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get up early for lab tomorrow, and I\u2019d rather not be buzzed.\u201d \n\u201cAll right.\u201d Erik kisses him lightly on the forehead and heads off through the crowd. \nRaven stares at them both. Not even half an hour ago, she\u2019d thought Erik Lehnsherr was incapable of any emotion other than sullen anger, or fierce anger, or frustrated anger. Seeing him now, so affectionate with his husband, is mind-blowing. This must be an alternate universe or something\u2014or maybe Erik\u2019s been replaced by a clone, a doppelganger\u2014because the Erik Lehnsherr who shuts himself up in his office and glares at people if they come too close is so not a man who kisses his husband so gently and offers to fetch him refreshments. Not. At. All. \n\u201cSo,\u201d Charles says into the silence, \u201cErik\u2019s told me about you all. Let me try to guess your names, all right? Humor me.\u201d \nNothing in the world could stand against his earnest smile. So they nod in acquiescence, and Charles scrutinizes them each in turn. \n\u201cEmma, right?\u201d he says slowly, pointing straight at her. \u201cAnd\u2026Raven, and Hank, and Alex, and Sean, Darwin, and Angel, and Moira.\u201d \n\u201cHow did you do that?\u201d Moira asks after a second, amazed. \nCharles laughs. \u201cErik talks a lot about you all. Plus, I have an excellent memory. Something that\u2019s helped me on through graduate school, that\u2019s for sure. I\u2019d tell you all about it, but people have been put to sleep by my lectures before. Genetics isn\u2019t for everyone.\u201d \nHe winks\u2014not a sleazy wink; a cute, charming one\u2014and at that point, Moira\u2019s pretty sure that anyone who meets this guy falls for him. Raven shares her opinion word-for-word. Emma wonders briefly if she\u2019d be able to wrestle this perfect-looking man away from Erik\u2019s side, the fact that he\u2019s gay be damned. Alex and Sean are wondering how the hell someone as grumpy as Erik snared someone as bright and charming as Charles. Darwin is thinking, Erik is one lucky bastard, and Hank is thinking, If he starts talking science, I would go gay for this guy. \nCharles is in the middle of explaining his intensive research on genetic mutations in the human population spanning three generations\u2014and Hank is in the middle of swooning\u2014when Erik returns, glass of water in hand and a crumpet in the other. \n\u201cHere,\u201d he says, handing both over to Charles. \nCharles\u2019s entire face lights up. \u201cA crumpet? Where on earth did you find this?\u201d\n\u201cThis is Tony Stark,\u201d Erik tells him. \u201cWhat can you not find at one of his parties?\u201d\n\u201cTrue that,\u201d Sean confirms, and the look Erik shoots him actually seems somewhat friendly\u2014or at least, not openly hostile. \n\u201cI was born in London,\u201d Charles explains to them, \u201cbut I moved here with my family when I was ten. Still, I\u2019m more English than I should be sometimes.\u201d He points to the crumpet and grins. \u201cCase in point: I miss the old food. Erik has to make grocery runs occasionally.\u201d \n\u201cThat\u2019s a lie,\u201d Erik mutters. \u201cI make grocery runs for your cravings every week.\u201d \n\u201cI said, \u2018occasionally.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cHe makes grocery runs for you?\u201d Alex asks, sounding awed. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t help any of us if we were on fire.\u201d \n\u201cIf we were on fire and being attacked by a serial killer,\u201d Sean adds. \n\u201cIf we were on fire and being attacked by a serial killer and falling out a tenth story window,\u201d Alex continues. \n\u201cIf we were on fire and being attacked by a serial killer and falling out a tenth story window and being shot at by ninja turtles!\u201d \n\u201cWhat\u2014Sean, that\u2019s lame!\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s a legitimate concern!\u201d \nErik stares at them both. \u201cI would help you,\u201d he says, indignant. \u201cOf course I would help.\u201d \n\u201cHe really would,\u201d Charles says. \u201cI told you, Erik\u2019s one of the nicest guys I know.\u201d \nHe finishes off that statement with an emphatic bite into his crumpet. The next sound that comes out of his mouth is a moan so obscene that Raven would have gotten a hard-on, if that were even remotely possible. All of them stare wide-eyed at him as he says through a mouthful of muffin, \u201cGood Lord, Erik, this is the best crumpet I\u2019ve ever had. Where on earth does Tony Stark get these things?\u201d\nErik looks perfectly at ease, so maybe Charles having food orgasms is a regular occurrence. Either that, or Erik\u2019s got the self-control of an android. \n\u201cStark never settles for anything but the best,\u201d he says. \u201cExplains why the company\u2019s in the state it is.\u201d \n\u201cThat, and Stark\u2019s decision to take his weapons line off production,\u201d Charles muses. \u201cVery admirable of him, in my opinion.\u201d \nErik harrumphs. \u201cClosing the most profitable part of his business? Yes, very admirable.\u201d \n\u201cBut he is adding new departments,\u201d Charles points out. \u201cStark Industries is going to new places, isn\u2019t that what he said? They\u2019ll have new avenues to explore, new things to do. This company is far from going downhill.\u201d \n\u201cBut it could be better,\u201d Erik argues. \u201cThis entire company was built on weapons manufacturing. Changing the identity of the company is impossible to do in such a short time, which is what Stark\u2019s trying to do.\u201d \n\u201cYou have to give him credit for it,\u201d Charles says, sipping his water. \u201cHe\u2019s doing what he thinks is right.\u201d \n\u201cWhat\u2019s right isn\u2019t always what\u2019s best.\u201d \n\u201cAt that, love, I\u2019ll have to politely disagree,\u201d Charles says with a cheeky grin. \u201cAs always.\u201d \n\u201cAs always,\u201d Erik says, and subsides. \nThey marvel at that. Erik never backs down. Ever. For anyone. Who the hell is Charles Xavier and what kind of miracle worker is he? \n\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want any champagne?\u201d Erik asks after a moment. \n\u201cNo, I\u2019m certain,\u201d Charles replies. \u201cI absolutely cannot be hungover tomorrow. It\u2019s a big day for the lab.\u201d \nErik snorts. \u201cHungover? Please, Charles. You\u2019re hardly a lightweight.\u201d \n\u201cNo, you\u2019re right. But still.\u201d \n\u201cNot a lightweight?\u201d Raven interjects, eyeing Charles\u2019s slight frame. He looks as if one beer would put him under for twelve hours at least. \nErik scoffs at her skeptical tone. \u201cYou don\u2019t know drinking until you\u2019ve drunk with Charles. He can drink you under the table.\u201d \n\u201cThat\u2019s hardly true,\u201d Charles protests. \n\u201cRight. He can drink you under the table and then still be drinking by the time you wake up.\u201d \nCharles pouts. \u201cGoing around spreading rumors about me, ruining my reputation? What kind of husband are you anyway?\u201d\n\u201cThe best kind,\u201d Erik says, and kisses him. \nIt\u2019s lovey-dovey. It\u2019s unbearably lovey-dovey. Raven can feel her head having a mini-implosion at the incongruity\u2014they\u2019re just so cute together, and cute is a word that should never, ever, ever in any universe be associated with Erik Lehnsherr, cruel slave-driver extraordinaire. \nAnd yet. \nFor the rest of the night, Charles regales them with stories of his college days, of his current professorship, and of him and Erik. He is unbelievably charming and nice and funny. Most of the group is probably half in love with him before the night is out, and if he and Erik ever split up, there would be at least two proposals before Charles could so much as sign divorce papers. He tells them all of Erik\u2019s little, strange quirks, with Erik standing by with an abashed look on his face that says, \u201cIf this were anyone else but you, Charles, I would be ripping your tongue out right now for embarrassing me.\u201d \n\u201cHow did you meet?\u201d Angel asks eagerly. Deep down under the cynical nature, she\u2019s a romantic. \u201cTell us how you met.\u201d \nErik groans. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d \nCharles grins widely. \u201cErik hates this story because it proves that he's a big softy inside, but I love it. It was\u2026almost seven years ago now. I was walking down 8th Street at night. It was probably around eight\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt was nine-thirty,\u201d Erik corrects. \n\u201cRight, nine-thirty. So it was pretty dark, and I\u2019m trying to walk quickly because you know how the streets can get dangerous at night. My flat was\u2014what, seven blocks away at the time?\u201d\n\u201cEight,\u201d Erik says. \n\u201cEight,\u201d Charles agrees. \u201cEight blocks to go at night. All of a sudden, this cab pulls up next to me, and I tense up. I\u2019m pretty sure someone\u2019s about to hop out and I\u2019m about to get kidnapped or mugged or something, and then this tall, gorgeous man climbs out of the cab and asks me if I\u2019m okay.\u201d He laughs. \u201cReally, his first words to me were, \u2018Do you need help?\u2019 Then\u2014can you believe it\u2014he gave me his jacket. A complete stranger.\u201d \n\u201cIt was cold,\u201d Erik mutters. \u201cYou were walking without a coat or a scarf, and it was probably forty degrees outside. You looked cold.\u201d \n\u201cYou thought I was a homeless person,\u201d Charles accuses, though his smile tells them he\u2019s only teasing. \n\u201cYou were wearing tweed. You looked like you\u2019d walked into a Goodwill, shut your eyes, and grabbed random clothes off the racks.\u201d \nCharles winces. \u201cNot true.\u201d At their incredulous looks\u2014because he is probably the best-dressed man they\u2019ve seen all night\u2014he grins and, as if he\u2019s read their minds, explains, \u201cI grew up with a lot of family money. I know how to dress. I just prefer not to.\u201d \nErik rolls his eyes. \u201cWhich is a shame.\u201d His voice drops a little, and he meets Charles\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou look amazing, by the way.\u201d \nCharles flushes a bit in pleasure. \u201cThank you. So do you.\u201d \nThey share some intense eye contact, which Raven breaks with an uncomfortable cough. \u201cUm\u2026the story?\u201d\nCharles looks away first, clearing his throat. \u201cRight. The story. Where was I?\u201d He thinks for a second, sipping his water as he does. \u201cOh, right. So Erik asks me why I\u2019m walking and not getting into a taxi, since it\u2019s dangerous to walk alone at night. I tell him that I don\u2019t have my wallet on me, which is true; I\u2019d forgotten it back in my office at the university, and I\u2019d already walked too far to go back to get it. So Erik tells me to get into his taxi.\u201d \n\u201cI suggested it.\u201d \n\u201cNo, your exact words were, \u2018Get in the cab. You\u2019re not walking.\u2019 Which was more than a little questionable, in retrospect; if you\u2019d been a serial killer, I\u2019d have been dead.\u201d \n\u201cYeah, because you got into the cab without a word.\u201d \n\u201cBecause I was cold, and it was dangerous.\u201d Charles pauses. \u201cAlso, because you were the hottest thing on two legs I had ever seen, and I was planning to flirt with you.\u201d \n\u201cWhich he did, by the way,\u201d Erik adds. \u201cAnd for the record, he is a terrible flirt.\u201d \n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that,\u201d Charles sniffs. \u201cIt worked on you, after all.\u201d \n\u201cI took pity on you because you were so bad. That\u2019s the only reason I agreed to coffee the next day.\u201d \n\u201cI still maintain that it worked,\u201d Charles says. He holds up his left hand, wedding band gleaming. \u201cThis is proof.\u201d \n\u201cSo he drove you home?\u201d Moira asks, a dreamy smile on her face. \u201cHow sweet.\u201d \n\u201cYep. Drove me straight to my flat and paid for the fare, too.\u201d Charles grins at Erik, something soft and private in the expression. \u201cTold you he was a gentleman underneath all that grumpiness.\u201d \n\u201cOh, shut up,\u201d Erik retorts, but it\u2019s good-natured. He smiles back, and for once, it doesn\u2019t look as if he\u2019s plotting murders; in fact, it actually looks fairly happy, and maybe even a little handsome. In that moment, Raven thinks she can see something of what Charles must see: a different Erik altogether than the one who terrorizes them about color-coding and stapling on the wrong corner of the papers. \nTheir eye contact goes on a little too long again, and when it looks like they\u2019re on the verge of grabbing each other and making out, Emma says smoothly, \u201cWho wants drinks?\u201d\n\u201cMe,\u201d they all chorus at once, realizing at the same time that they haven\u2019t had one drink all night, which, in a Tony Stark party, is something of a miracle. Apparently, Charles Xavier is just that genuinely interesting. \n\u201cI think you\u2019ll have to count us out,\u201d Erik says. \u201cSorry.\u201d He manages to make it sound somewhat apologetic. \n\u201cSorry,\u201d Charles echoes. \u201cNo alcohol for me tonight.\u201d \nErik puts a hand on the small of his back. \u201cI\u2019m ready to go if you are.\u201d \n\u201cYes, sure.\u201d Charles smiles at them all and gives them a little salute. \u201cGood to meet you all. I hope we see each other again.\u201d \nThey offer him a chorus of the same\u2014yes, it was a pleasure to meet him, he should drop by the office some time, or go out with them for drinks after work. He promises to do so at some point, making sure they have his number so they can contact him later. Then he takes Erik\u2019s hand, lacing their fingers together, and gives them one last wave goodbye before disappearing. \n\u201cWell,\u201d Sean says after a moment. \u201cThat was unexpected.\u201d \n\u201cIf you\u2019re referring to the whole night,\u201d Alex tells him, \u201cthen yes. Let\u2019s get drunk.\u201d \nIt seems like the best way to deal with the residual shock of meeting Erik\u2019s perfect, amazing, brilliant, charming, nice husband and having all of their preconceptions absolutely shattered, so they all go and do just that.\n\n*\n*\n*\n\u201cThey hate me,\u201d Erik groans, rolling off Charles and onto his side of the bed. \n\u201cOh please,\u201d Charles says breezily. \u201cNo one can hate you. They just\u2026don\u2019t know you like I do.\u201d \n\u201cRight.\u201d Erik kisses the crook of Charles\u2019s elbow. \u201cAnd they never will.\u201d \nCharles laughs. \u201cWell, when you put it that way, I hope they never will.\u201d After a moment, he sobers up and says, \u201cI hope you make friends there, Erik. I don\u2019t want you to be lonely in your own office. That can\u2019t be healthy.\u201d \nErik is silent for a second. Then he says, a bit awkwardly, \u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d \n\n\u201cTry?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go out the next time they ask me. Happy?\u201d\n\u201cVery.\u201d \nErik sighs. \u201cForcing me to go out with people who hate my guts,\u201d he laments. \u201cWhat kind of husband are you anyway?\u201d\nCharles grins and rolls so that he\u2019s half on top of Erik\u2019s chest, looking down at him. He studies Erik\u2019s expression for a moment: teasing, half-amused, those lips twitching up into a smile. He really is amazing. Hopefully Erik\u2019s office will one day see that. \n\u201cOnly the very best kind,\u201d Charles answers, and then leans down for a kiss."
