    "notes": "<p>Alright i've spent the past 10 days reading jaskier/geralt fics and it's finally time i jumped on the fix-ep6-or-die-trying bandwagon<br>I was so MAD that the big dumb idiot said all those things to Jaskier because Jaskier is Baby so now i'm taking it out on Geralt in this fic<br>I want him to grovel for forgiveness and so he shall. but fret not, a happy ending's on the horizon.<br>I'm mid the witcher 3 gameplay binge so there's a bit of that in there just some certain plot devices that don't matter in the overall scheme of things dont worry<br>Anyway, there'll be three chapters i think - last one being the /happy/ ending ;)<br>I churned this out in a day and a half and it's not edited so take it easy on me and enjoy!</p>\n<p>PSSS<br>Stupid that i even have to say it but if you dont have my explicit permission DO NOT upload my fics onto pages outside of ao3 even if its just listing them as works and me as an author thank you!!!!!!!!</p>\n<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#work_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_1_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>you know, i wanted to give Jaskier an edge in this so that's why he's a little ooc at times. Imagine giving almost your all to some lumbering idiot only for him to ditch you like that? It'll give any cheerful man a pause and roughen his edges so yeah, he's a little bit bitter and angry but he's doing well regardless!!! <br>I also love the idea of a jaskier/yennefer friendship bc she'd be the best wingwoman ever. and i really love triss so i mixed up a bit of her from the netflix show and the games to give it some depth.</p>\n<p>WOW okay WOW you guys like holy shit<br>I just finished this chap and it's all thanks to all of your amazing comments i'm truly honoured to be accepted with open arms into this new and funky fresh fandom and that you all like this story so far!<br>I dont think i would have finished this chapter as fast as i did if you guys hadnt taken a shine to the first one! And while i dont think i'll respond to all of them know that i have read them and that i appreciate them greatly and wow. i'm just so flattered, gosh!</p>\n<p>Anyway! Surprise! It's a Geralt POV chapter!<br>I'll get back to y'all in the notes at the end abt my thoughts on this one!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_2_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Okay SO<br>-Geralt is a dumbass but he's trying. I loved breaking the fourth wall with him a little so excuse me being a literature nerd. I also needed to make sure that he knows what he did wrong and that it was clear from the start that he's been an asshole.<br>- Triss is PURE and must be PROTECTED and i love her a lot okay Triss baby you dont need Geralt i'll marry you<br>- i went in on that monster bit a little bc i do love that whole aspect of the series but i just cant fit an entire monster hunting mystery into this without it seeming like it's unnecessary and the Gryttie is a nordic cryptid or something that i'd looked up when i needed an acquatic based monster for the scene<br>-it took me far longer than id like to admit to settle on a proper timeline for this fic and ill probably make a graphic for it eventually if anyone wants to see it (once the fic is over of course) AND i mostly completely disregard the shows actual timeline bc my mans (jaskier) doesnt look a day over 25.<br>- What is Yen up to? Well, she's being the best wingwoman she can possibly be and maybe she exaggerates a little sometimes but - well, anything for a happy ending right?<br>- What is Yen up to? pt. two - it's not as important but stay tuned anyway!<br><a href=\"https://marionettefthjm.tumblr.com/post/190342683260/its-geralt-but-hes-got-braids-nowrel=\" rel=\"nofollow\">geralt with some braids that i drew</a></p>\n<p>hoooo my lovelies!! Here it is, the final chapter! You've all been so wonderful and I'm so glad you like my edge-lord bitter Jaskier and soft goth himbo Geralt so much!<br>Some warnings for the smut: graphic, barebacking bc duh, btm jaskier but he's bossy, jaskier's potty mouth and geralt getting a little possessive, overall p soft and sweet<br>As a sidenote i always find it hard not to use modern day terms and slang for things so if u catch something out of place dont mind me my brain's wired for contemp language and i don't read books lmao <br>More in the end notes as always and enjoy!<br>Also, people calling Jaskier Julian when they want to be serious is my new headcanon<br>I also drop some canon lore in there abt the two but thats neither here nor there</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_3_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Okay, first of all! I want to address the Yen/Triss situation:<br>- in game, as far as i know, they were both super into Geralt and i simply, did not give a fuck and cut out the middle man (geralt) and now they're engage to be married and on the run bc Yen probably did some dumb shit and got them into trouble<br>Second of all: Jaskier and Geralt lived happily ever after and Geralt found Jaskier in every life that they lived ever because they're SOULMATES okay.<br>Thirdly: i didnt go into the grovelling as much as i wanted to because i wanted it to be going on over a period of several days so if he'd done it all at once it would have been more detailed but not as impactful as imagining geralt hanging out and gardening for two weeks<br>And lastly, i want to thank everyone for loving this story and supporting my dumb ideas and headcanons and i hope yall are satisfied with the ending!</p>\n<p>Title from Joey's band called the Amazing devil the song Pray they're super good so go support them!!! and find me on Hit me up on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarionetteFtHJM\" rel=\"nofollow\">twitter</a> or on Hit me up on <a href=\"https://marionettefthjm.tumblr.com/post/190342683260/its-geralt-but-hes-got-braids-nowrel=\" rel=\"nofollow\">tumblr</a> @marionettefthjm where im always available to answer questions and maybe take prompts who knows!<br>Also, a little update due to recent developments in my own psyche and stuff: im not really comfy when people comment on the smut portion of the story in detail, like ik i wrote this but i send it out into the universe and dont think abt it much after the fact and it just makes me kinda uncomfy now, thank you!</p>",
    "text": "\u201cDamn it, Jaskier! Why is it whenever I find myself in a pile of shit these days, it\u2019s you shovelling it?\u201d \nThe words were still ringing in his head as he left the mountainside where Geralt sat and brooded as the sun set.\nIt hurt. It really did. And Jaskier isn\u2019t going to kid himself and try to cover his unfortunate feelings towards the Witcher with false cheer. He is, despite the popular belief of the common folk, very in touch with his emotions. It takes a well-educated, observant, sensible man to make a good poet and an excellent bard. And he fancies himself one of those, after all, and furthermore, by default, he is all of those things. So yes, Jaskier was well aware of his pining woes no matter how much they inconvenienced him daily. He is also well aware that the hurt he feels in the moment will be much worse than it is during his miserable walk to the nearest town, with his lute dangling from his hand and his footsteps dragging through the gravelly dirt, in the morning.\nBut for now, the keen loss is only a dull pain in his chest \u2013 it feels like there is a heavy weight sitting upon his ribcage; like his lungs are constricting but he can still breathe regardless as if it is a mercy. And that is, admittedly, good, because he can\u2019t afford to be distracted on his arduous trek. This distraction he fears due to his unfortunate inclination towards bad decisions. If there was even the slightest chance that a moment of hesitation was to present itself, it might be enough to send him stumbling over his feet back to Geralt\u2019s side. So no acknowledged pain for the time being.\nEventually, he reaches the nearest town. It is a small settlement on the bank of a river that courses furiously around boulders that have separated from the mountain and rolled off its face to live a life of their own years prior. Much like Jaskier \u2013 except Jaskier had been removed from his mountain\u2019s side rather forcefully.\nNo, none of that. He scoffs at himself, entering the town\u2019s inn. He needs a good night\u2019s sleep and some food before he goes about waxing poetic pathetically to himself. He feels drained as he coughs up the last of his coin to the innkeeper, feels like he weighs more than he actually does.\nMust be the emotional baggage, he decides as he climbs the rickety stairs to the room he\u2019d rented. He hopes that he doesn\u2019t dream of the Witcher. He hopes that his brain gives him a reprieve for tonight if not any other night.\nHe drops the lute at the bedside table carelessly and kicks off his boots. He crawls under the flimsy and rough blankets and closes his eyes; curling in on himself he falls asleep, he wishes for a better tomorrow.\nDespite what his outward code of conduct would have you thinking, Jaskier knows when he is not wanted.\nHe allows himself the exact amount of three days of wallowing in that small town before he packs his meagre possessions and hits the road like nothing happened. In those three days he sings and dances for his food and drink, fucks the pretty barmaid and sleeps off the hangover before heading out in the morning of the fourth day. He travels alone for the first time in a while but it\u2019s alright.\nIt\u2019s not as if he\u2019d been travelling with Geralt for the entirety of his bardic career, no. He knows how to handle himself on his own. Geralt always had everyone believing that Jaskier was inept at keeping his head about him but that wasn\u2019t true. He knows which roads to avoid and which travelling troupes are always looking for an extra set of hands to play an instrument. He can hold a tune and spin a tale and in these dark times, entertainment is a sought-after luxury that many hold dear. It\u2019s just that \u2013 well, travelling with the mighty Witcher had allowed him for some time off. He didn\u2019t always have to be vigilant or on the lookout if Geralt was already doing that for the both of them and thus he had gotten sloppy and earned himself Geralt\u2019s disdain. But that\u2019s all over now; he has to make do on his own again. \u00a0\nSo he does so and makes his way down one of the more well-travelled routes, heading towards Novigrad as his final destination where he thinks he might settle down for a while. He\u2019s always wanted to be an author \u2013 maybe he writes a scripture of his travels with the Witcher, maybe he doesn\u2019t \u2013 depending on how he feels about the whole thing by the time he reaches the city on the coast.\nA few weeks into his travels, on the border of Redania, in Tridam to be exact, he runs into Yennefer.\nHe\u2019s singing at the court of the local Baron, his daughter\u2019s betrothal banquet is in full swing and no matter how much he thinks about it in the recesses of his mind, he won\u2019t admit that it reminds him of his time in Queen Calanthe\u2019s court on that fateful day.\nHe\u2019s hopping from one table to another, going down the list of the familiar hits he used to play for the noble folk before he\u2019d gotten sidetracked by Geralt and the call to adventure. It\u2019s going swell, not a mishap in sight and really, Jaskier definitely isn\u2019t the one that called forth the shitty luck Geralt\u2019s had for most of their travels \u2013 it was the White Wolf himself that was to blame, him and his stubbornness. And he knows that, everyone knows that \u2013 everyone except for the Witcher himself.\nHe\u2019s halfway through the chorus of The Fishmonger\u2019s Daughter when he spots her and her beady little purple eyes staring at him across the hall. He trips over someone\u2019s foot sticking out from the bench they\u2019re sitting on but recovers quickly, playing it off as a change of cords as he improvises a chorus that has the men and women in the court roaring with cheer. He takes a bow as he reaches the middle of the wide room.\n\u201cThank you all, you\u2019ve been lovely and I shall be by in the morning to collect my coin! But the humble bard must retreat for the evening!\u201d He bows again with flourish as some of the people in the hall protest at his sudden and hasty departure. Oh, the fat bastards of the court are never satisfied! He\u2019s been there for the entire night already, it\u2019s about time he packed up and got a good night\u2019s sleep in lest he lose his voice. His retreat has nothing to do with Yennefer leering at him from the corner of the room, surrounded by feeble men attracted to her like flies to a fresh pile of horseshit.\nHe makes haste towards the exit of the castle, careful not to drop the bottle of wine and his lute on the way down the worn, stone steps. He\u2019s so busy trying to balance his belongings and thinking that he\u2019d gotten away from her vengeful gaze that he doesn\u2019t realize he\u2019s walking right into her until it\u2019s too late and \u2013 damn it, he\u2019s dropped the wine!\n\u201cOh, not the wine, mercy please.\u201d He watches the cracked bottle leaking with sad eyes. He should have known better.\n\u201cJulian.\u201d She clears her throat like he hadn\u2019t seen her already.\n\u201cWhat do you want, you wretch? I, for one, wanted that bottle of wine and yet here we are \u2013 a bottle broken and an uncomfortable encounter on my hands instead. So, what is it?\u201d He picks up his lute before the wine can get to it and slings it over his shoulder. He\u2019s not nearly drunk enough for this confrontation \u2013 if he were, well, then he\u2019d preferably be passed out in a ditch somewhere.\nShe looks at him funny then; one of her impressive eyebrows quirked and her jaw set like she\u2019d expected a warm welcome or something. She stays silent, though, furthering Jaskier into irritation.\n\u201cWell?\u201d He waves a hand out impatiently. He\u2019d rather be having this conversation somewhere else \u2013 or not at all, really.\n\u201cYou \u2013 you\u2019re doing well for yourself.\u201d She says like it\u2019s a surprise, like she expected something else entirely. Like she expected him to mourn.\nAnd maybe it is a surprise. It\u2019s not like she knew him from before he\u2019d been travelling with Geralt. She never bothered to know him even then; she was too busy being a powerful sorceress, was too busy sucking co-\n\u201cYes, I was. But then I saw your puckered little face shooting daggers in my direction and my night got progressively worse. And I still don\u2019t have any wine to drown my woes in.\u201d He points a finger at her accusingly. And he knows that he may be coming off as an absolute dick but he\u2019s a little angry. He\u2019s \u2013 he\u2019s not bitter with her or the situation, not when he knew he never stood a chance, but he is angry that she\u2019s given herself the liberty to speak to him like she knew him as anything other than Geralt\u2019s faithful puppy.\n\u201cNo, I mean. All things considered?\u201d She shrinks in on herself then, some of her deeply-rooted insecurity leaking to the surface and Jaskier straightens up his back, crossing his arms over his chest, taking advantage of her lapse in posture.\n\u201cWhich things considered? Considering that I\u2019m travelling on my own again or that Geralt had decided to blame Destiny on me? If it\u2019s both, I\u2019ll have you know, I was doing fine before him and there\u2019s no reason why I should be any worse off without him.\u201d He huffs with a roll of his eyes and tries to move past her but she grabs his wrist, stopping him in place. A shudder goes through him at her cold touch and he looks back, eyes squinted in suspicion at what more she could possibly want.\nShe\u2019s holding a bottle out for him as if it\u2019s a peace offering and his mind halts, anything vile that wanted to spill from his loosed lips dries up immediately at the tentative offering. There\u2019s something oddly open in her gaze as she implores him to take the wine.\nHe grabs the bottle reluctantly, popping it open and sniffing before taking a swig. Well, if she\u2019s poisoned him, it\u2019s too late now anyway. He may not be an idiot but his self-preservation instincts are very minimal.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cFor what? The wine? You fixed that. For assuming I\u2019m an incapable buffoon? I don\u2019t blame you; I didn\u2019t give myself the best reputation during our brief ventures together. For the insults hurled at me every time we met? Well, nothing to it, you\u2019re always half right anyway.\u201d He snorts, only slightly ashamed of his rambling \u2013 especially the bit about his travels with the Witcher. He\u2019d loved travelling with Geralt, loved the security that came adjacent to travelling with a Witcher despite the messes they\u2019d gotten into. But he was a fool to let himself act the way he did, he was an idiot chasing coin and skirt and Geralt\u2019s shining eyes. He knows better now; knew better back then, too, but was blinded by Geralt\u2019s sheer presence and his striking features.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry about Geralt.\u201d She releases his wrist but he stays. He doesn\u2019t know why because he doesn\u2019t have any reason to, but he does anyway.\n\u201cWhy? You didn\u2019t send me on my way; you didn\u2019t make him say what he did. You\u2019ve got nothing to be sorry for, Yennefer.\u201d He shakes his head, contemplating downing half of the bottle in his next sip.\n\u201cNo, but I\u2019d made him angry and he took it out on you when you didn\u2019t deserve it.\u201d She shrugs, bundling up in her coat like she\u2019s trying to stave off something other than the cold.\nHe scoffs, \u201cStop \u2013 stop whatever this pity party is, Yennefer. You might have made him mad but I\u2019d allowed myself-\u201d He shakes his head and stops speaking before all of his problems become real. \u201cHe did what he did and it was for the best. I\u2019d become dependent on him for safety and for my inspiration. It was time for me to move on and he\u2019d just opened my eyes to it. I should be thanking you.\u201d He clears his throat, trying to lighten up his tone. \u201cBesides, Geralt is a grown man who should have respected your wishes to be left alone. He should be apologizing to you for his beastly ways.\u201d\nThis time, it\u2019s her that laughs \u2013 a brittle and bitter little thing as she shakes her head, dark hair falling over her face. \u201cI can\u2019t believe \u2013 I envy you, Jaskier. Look at you \u2013 you\u2019re doing so well and I\u2019d been worried for nothing all along.\u201d\n\u201cBollocks were you worried!\u201d He laughs at the notion; like they\u2019d ever even been more than a weird sort of rivals for Geralt\u2019s attention let alone friends. He was but a speck of dirt on her field of vision, something to make fun of and look down at with pity in her violet eyes as he pined silently when Geralt shared her tent and her bed.\n\u201cI was. I know it\u2019s hard to believe but yes, I was. I know now that it was for naught because you certainly are stronger than you seem.\u201d She praises him and this gives him pause.\nHe feels his cheeks heat a little under the attention and he clears his throat weakly. \u201cWhy should you envy me? I\u2019ve nothing to my name except a lute, a bag of coin and a destination in mind. A couple of songs under my belt and the ability to charm the skirt off any maiden. Actually, never mind, that\u2019s quite an impressive list. Especially that last part, let me tell you.\u201d\n\u201cI envy you because it took me much longer than I\u2019d like to admit to get over what Geralt and I had than it had taken you. I\u2019d heard tales by the fifth day of you already celebrating at some Lord\u2019s hall with a troupe of his local troubadours.\u201d She smiles thinly and Jaskier notices the lines of worry around her eyes that weren\u2019t there the last time they\u2019d met.\nHe looks away, unsure of how to proceed. It\u2019s not like he\u2019d mourned a lover lost. It\u2019s not like Geralt had given him grief about anything actually possible. Sure it still hurts on some days \u2013 like when he turns to say something to the Witcher only to find him not there, but he gets over it quickly. So she\u2019s not entirely correct in her assumption, he\u2019s not over it, not fully. He\u2019s just \u2013 better at suppressing feelings than even perhaps the Witcher himself. No sense in crying over spilt wine, as they say.\n\u201cWhat you and he had was a much deeper connection than that of a Witcher and his travelling bard. What you and he had was real.\u201d He says in the calmest voice possible, still not willing to admit how jealousy had cut a path down his chest that scarred him from the inside every time Geralt had gone to her instead of spent a night under the stars by the fire with him. She might know the depths of his plight but he will not outright admit it.\nYennefer tilts her head and places a hand on his chest gently; she closes her eyes and smiles timidly. \u201cI\u2019d underestimated you, Jaskier.\u201d She admits with a lilting tone. \u201cYou are much stronger than both I and Geralt combined. Maybe not in a physical sense, but in here, where it matters.\u201d She pats his chest and then steps back.\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s good to hear. I think?\u201d He blinks at her, baffled at the sudden genuine turn of phrase coming from her painted lips.\n\u201cI hope that despite our differences, you don\u2019t think of me in a bad light. I wish you the best on your travels and that you don\u2019t hesitate to contact me if you need any help.\u201d She procures a small, round, metal box adorned with intricate detailing seemingly out of nowhere and lifts it towards him.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not going to blow up in my face if I touch it, is it?\u201d He pokes at the box curiously and she chuckles. He startles at the sound and pulls back, much more alarmed now than he was before.\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s a xenovox. It\u2019s a long-range communication device that\u2019ll give you a direct line of contact to me if you should need it.\u201d She holds it out again insistently and he takes it, still surprised and slightly doubtful.\n\u201cI \u2013 thank you, Yennefer, you didn\u2019t have to.\u201d He puts the object into the satchel on his hip with care.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t, but I wanted to. Be careful out there, Jaskier, it\u2019s a full moon tonight.\u201d She pats his cheek in a friendly manner and turns back, walking up the stone steps and disappearing behind the corner before he can think of an appropriate reply.\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t weird at all. I might be losing my mind.\u201d He says out-loud to himself just to check if he still has a voice or if she\u2019d somehow taken it with her.\n\u201cIf that wasn\u2019t the weirdest thing-\u201d Shaking his head, he makes his way down the cobblestoned path and into the servant\u2019s quarters where he\u2019ll be staying the night.\nOut of all the things, he muses as he lies down to sleep, the bottle of wine forgotten next to the low bed.\nA few months down the line, several detours and many a night spent well-fed on someone\u2019s court, he finds himself in a small town a day\u2019s worth of ride outside of Vizima. He finds himself there due to necessity because, as it were, he is bleeding out from a nasty gash on his leg and a stab to his side. It was only right that after a few months of peace and quiet on his travels, Yennefer\u2019s well wishes would wear out and he\u2019d get jumped by a group of bandits looking to fuck over anyone that crosses their path. Today, that happened to be none other than Jaskier.\n\u201cIf I die I want my body buried in Dol Blathanna.\u201d He whines as whoever is taking care of his wounds, digs deep into his side to try and pluck out the broken tip of a sorry excuse for a knife one of the bandits had wielded.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to die,\u201d The gentle voice belonging to the curly-haired woman soothes but it\u2019s no use, he feels like he\u2019s on fire.\n\u201cAnd I never even got to write my memoires! I was going to become famous \u2013 ah, fuck!\u201d He almost bites through his lip trying to contain the scream that wants to escape him. \u201cI was going to become rich! Everyone\u2019s always asking me oh, humble bard, for what adventures have you seen in your time! And I \u2013 fuck, shit, that\u2019s a lot of blood.\u201d He feels faint as he watches her exchange the soaked rag with a clean one, staunching the blood flow again.\n\u201cHold still, you imp!\u201d She hisses impatiently as he tries to wiggle away from the pain at her touch.\n\u201cCan\u2019t you knock me out? Please? It would save the both of us a lot of trouble.\u201d He whines pathetically.\nHe should be thankful, he knows. He\u2019d be dead already if it weren\u2019t for her. He doesn\u2019t even know her name and she\u2019s got her fingers in his wound because there\u2019s still that pesky bit of knife stuck in there and oh how he wishes he was out cold!\n\u201cOh, Dol Blathanna was beautifully deserted! Fuck!\u201d He yelps as she pulls out the metal tip from his side, this is going to take ages to heal properly! \u201cNo bandits! No stupid townsfolk asking me where \u2013 only Filavandrel and his merry band of Elves to hear my songs!\u201d He laments sadly, pretty certain that he is shouting. \u201cOh! Oh, that hurts! Oh, when a humble bard-\u201d He wails to distracts himself from the agony spreading through his entire left side. \u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s a miracle you haven\u2019t passed out from the pain yet \u2013 wait.\u201d She finally meets his eye, eyebrows raised into her hairline almost. \u201cYou\u2019re Jaskier? The Wi-\u201d\n\u201cI am no one\u2019s bard!\u201d He grits out with his eyes shut and his fists clenched because he knows what she was going to say \u2013 he\u2019s been hearing it for the past few months.\nThis is precisely why he\u2019d gotten into this situation as well. He\u2019d gotten tired of the safe paths because everyone he\u2019d come across would immediately ask where his Witcher was. \u2018Oh, the Butcher of Blaviken! I\u2019d like to see the beast with my own two eyes, where is he, bard?\u2019 they\u2019d ask. Or: \u2018The White Wolf of Rivia! My, what an honour it must be to travel with him, where is he?\u2019 they\u2019d implore. And he\u2019d gotten tired of it after the first three times but people just kept assuming and when he\u2019d say that he was on his own they would either look at him with pity in their eyes or try and slander Geralt for leaving him behind. And he was having none of that.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d The woman, places a hand over his wound before digging through the bag next to her, clinking vials of something together until she locates the one she apparently needs. \u201cI\u2019ll need you to come back with me to Vizima. This will hold for now but you need to rest before you can continue with your journey.\u201d\nHe grunts but chooses to keep his mouth shut. He watches her soak a bandage with the sweet-smelling potion and then wrap it around his leg, and around his waist. The pain lessens almost instantly, the whole area becoming numb.\n\u201cCome on, up you go.\u201d She helps him stand and then he watches with fascination as she opens up a swirly portal out of thin air and guides them both through it. A sorceress, of course, just his luck. He hopes she\u2019s less mean than the other one he knows. Though, he supposes him and Yennefer are on neutral grounds now.\n\u201cWhat \u2013 your name, I need to know who to write my odes to once I am saved.\u201d He tries to grin as she deposits him into a soft bed.\nShe shakes her head with a small smile, \u201cTriss Merigold, at your service, bard.\u201d\n\u201cJust Jaskier will do.\u201d He sighs as he lies down, staring up at the vaulted ceilings. It\u2019s warm in the room but maybe that\u2019s his body protesting the potion she\u2019d dipped into his blood. Either way, his life is now in her hands entirely.\n\u201cWell then, Jaskier, it\u2019s time to rest.\u201d She closes a hand over his eyes and just like that, his consciousness is no more.\nHe doesn\u2019t know how long he\u2019s spent out cold but when he wakes, it\u2019s night time and Triss is sitting by the bed in a cushy armchair reading something from a thick book. He looks at her curiously, at the way she\u2019s poised gracefully in the chair and the blue dress that\u2019s contrasting with her tan skin prettily. If he weren\u2019t sure Geralt had already tried something with her, he would have attempted to at least flirt his way into her bed \u2013 but under better circumstances, certainly. If this even is her bed? Where was he again?\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re awake.\u201d She sets the book down and comes to his side, busying herself with checking on his wounds that feel much better at the moment than he last remembers. \u201cDo you know where you are?\u201d\n\u201cHm, somewhere nice, I\u2019m sure.\u201d He tries to grin but coughs as he finds his throat parched.\nShe chuckles and brings him a cup of water that he downs eagerly. \u201cEasy there, you\u2019ve been out for a while now. Three days, I\u2019m afraid. The knife didn\u2019t nick anything important but it was still a deep wound.\u201d\n\u201cThank you.\u201d He says, hoping that he can somehow repay her for the act of kindness. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cNonsense, all in a day\u2019s work.\u201d She waves him off with a grin.\n\u201cNo, no. I must repay you somehow. I have no coin on me or my beating would have been worse but perhaps a song to soothe your soul? Maybe a dance if I\u2019m up to it or perhaps a poem to your name? Oh, what shines brighter than silver and gold but the smile of Triss by the name Merigold? No, that was terrible, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll come up with something better once I\u2019m at my best!\u201d He rambles, pulling himself out of the bed, eager to leave the bed and Vizima altogether but stopping when she waves him back in warning.\n\u201cHe was right, you do talk a lot.\u201d She stares at him in contemplation for a moment before offering him another cup of water. He drinks this one slower, buying himself time before he has to respond.\n\u201cYes, well, he was always rather adamant about voicing that opinion.\u201d He shrugs and then pokes at the cloth where the wound in his side is. He winces as the tender flesh protests under the bandage.\n\u201cHe\u2019s an oaf but he usually means well.\u201d She tutts and bats his hand away.\nHe grunts, a sound very uncharacteristic for him, annoyed at her presumptions. How does she know? Has she spent much time with the Witcher? It\u2019s unlikely. Geralt doesn\u2019t spend much time with anyone \u2013 except for Roach but that\u2019s a given. Aside from that, Jaskier was possibly the only one that stuck around for more than a couple of nights with the Witcher. A mighty feat, sure, but what good has it brought him?\nShe tilts her head at his non-response, studying him much like Yennefer always did. Like he\u2019s something fragile to be looked after and pitied, studied like a rare flower. It furthers his silent anger despite his usually sunny disposition.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not what I imagined when he\u2019d talked about you.\u201d She finally says, peeling off the bandage to show a sliver of a still-red scar where the puncture wound used to be. She moves on to his leg and he realizes that he\u2019s very nearly naked in bed \u2013 it would be an entirely welcome situation were it not for the swirling pit of emotions opening up in his stomach. Geralt talked about him? No, he probably complained about me. He doesn\u2019t have words of kindness to spare for the likes of me. He doesn\u2019t have words to spare, end of statement. \n\u201cWell, people do change all the time.\u201d She finishes for him, saving Jaskier the trouble of responding.\n\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you want to hear what he was here to do? You know, for one of your new songs.\u201d She continues idly, tilting his leg to the side to check the deep gash that was once there as well. He hates to admit it but she\u2019s exceptionally good at this whole healing thing and he owes her his life so maybe he should be nicer to her.\nAnd alright, maybe he\u2019s itching to ask her about Geralt, about what he said but he won\u2019t stoop so low. Blindly searching for Geralt\u2019s words of approval is beneath him, he\u2019s decided a while back. He\u2019s moved on from being Geralt\u2019s faithful bardic companion and despite the feelings that still linger \u2013 and will probably continue to linger \u2013 he refuses to give into the need for praise.\n\u201cCurious indeed.\u201d She chuckles lowly and turns around to fetch something. When she turns back, she\u2019s holding a new outfit for him, something not covered in blood and dirtied from days on the road. His eyes widen as he takes in the deep navy of the fine material.\n\u201cYou know, when I said you talk a lot, I didn\u2019t mean for you to stop.\u201d She hands him the clothes and he sits up slowly. \u201cI feel as though I\u2019m talking to a wall and not the famous Bard that managed to clear up the Butcher of Blaviken\u2019s name!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve found that when one has nothing of import to say, one should not say anything at all.\u201d He hates to admit it but that\u2019s one of the rare lessons that\u2019s stuck with him from his time with Geralt. In just a few short months he\u2019s become the silent and resilient type of traveller he\u2019d always scoffed at. He hates to admit it but it has helped keep him out of trouble.\nMaybe Geralt was right all along. Oh how he despises to admit that he\u2019d become bitter and lonely. The Witcher might no longer be the Butcher of Blaviken but he certainly is the Butcher of Jaskier\u2019s Spirits.\nGods, he hates how testy he gets whenever Geralt is mentioned. He\u2019s not that bitter \u2013 he\u2019s not. \u00a0\n\u201cYennefer had some words to say about you as well.\u201d Triss politely turns away as he dresses.\nHe pauses, hands on his hips and brows arching. \u201cDo you all just gather around a big hearth and gossip like the commoners or do you exchange letters? Perhaps it\u2019s by xenovox?\u201d\nShe turns around with a smile on her face as if she\u2019s accomplished some great feat. \u201cNow how did you come into possession of one of those?\u201d\n\u201cUm, Yennefer gave me one in case I wanted to contact her.\u201d He admits, not sure if he\u2019s supposed to or not but \u2013 it\u2019s not like it is some big secret. Or is it?\n\u201cCurious, yet again! During our last encounter she\u2019d failed to mention this.\u201d Her eyes twinkle in the firelight and Jaskier wishes he could look into her mind to know what she\u2019s thinking. She seems like a complicated person. Much like any other magical being he\u2019d encountered.\n\u201cMaybe she likes people staying out of her business.\u201d He mutters under his breath, shakily doing up the buttons on the silk shirt.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, unlike Geralt\u2019s complaints, Yennefer had only words of praise for you. Though, the common theme was their uncharacteristic worry. Odd for the both of them but somehow more-so for Yen.\u201d Triss reassures him and yet, this only serves to make him feel worse. To know that the both of them care about his well-being still and that despite it, Geralt had chosen to send him away.\n\u201cIt\u2019s insulting that they think I can\u2019t take care of myself.\u201d He scoffs and she raises an eyebrow at him, motioning down to his newly-acquired scars. He clears his throat, \u201cThis incident notwithstanding.\u201d\n\u201cI can see why you\u2019d think that. You seem to have done well for yourself. I do not know you, Jaskier, but why the both of them would ever think you weak is beyond me.\u201d She declares firmly and he gulps down a panicked laugh.\nHis time away from the Witcher has certainly opened up his eyes to a few things. For one, he\u2019s now more aware that he had acted like a damn fool around the magical fucker. He has no one to blame for his situation but himself. And Geralt. He\u2019s still reasonably sure that he can blame Geralt for at least a few things.\nAn alarming amount of responses runs through his head and what ends up leaving mortifies him. \u201cWell, love makes us foolish, does it not?\u201d\nHer gaze darkens a little at that, straying away from where she\u2019d caught Jaskier\u2019s own. Her shoulders slump and she nods like she knows exactly what he\u2019s talking about. Is it possible? Is she another one of Geralt\u2019s pining beaus that were never anything more to him than a quick fuck? Oh, Jaskier knows just how highly possible this is. After all, he is probably the only fool that fell in love with the man without even getting a taste of him.\n\u201cYes, it certainly does.\u201d Triss agrees and shoots him a feeble smile that he knows far too well. \u201cAt least now it makes sense.\u201d She pins on to the end and now, well, now he\u2019s just confused.\n\u201cWhat does?\u201d He asks huffily, cursing the way that everyone skirts around sensitive topics like they\u2019ll get bitten by a basilisk and die if they so much as broach them.\n\u201cWhy he was so adamant to know if you were doing well.\u201d Her smile is still brittle as she moves closer to the large table in the corner of the room that holds stacks of books and bottles of various colors. \u201cYou see, he had me put a tracking spell on you of sorts. Not the kind that shows your location at all times, no. But the kind that lets me know if your blood is being spilt in a violent way. It\u2019s how I found you. The spell leaves much to be desired but it helped in the end. It was what he chose as his payment for his last job here.\u201d\nJaskier\u2019s entire body freezes over, cold dripping down into his stomach from an unknown source. He shivers at the feeling before his body erupts into indignant flames not visible to the human eye because, despite feeling very real, they are but a metaphor. He tightens his fists at his sides.\n\u201cHe-\u201d Taking a deep breath, he closes his eyes. \u201cWhy did he do that?\u201d\n\u201cBecause he\u2019s worried about you, Jaskier.\u201d Triss leans back against the table, observing him with narrowed eyes again.\n\u201cHe\u2019s worried that I will cause him trouble or tarnish his name, is what it is.\u201d He scoffs, looking around the room to try and locate his belongings. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have any right to be worried about me because \u2013 take the spell off, I don't want it. If I am to die by the age of twenty five then so be it. I don't care.\u201d He rounds on her, stance firm and demanding.\n\u201cJaskier, come on-\u201d She stands, trying to reach out to him but he\u2019s made up his mind.\n\nGeralt doesn\u2019t get to do this. \n\n\u201cNo, no. If he were really and truly worried he would have \u2013 I don't know. Probably done nothing because it\u2019s Geralt we\u2019re talking about here and we both know he\u2019s thicker than swamp mud!\u201d He waves a hand around frantically, still trying to locate his bag and finally spotting it, along with his muddy cloak, hanging off one of the antlers mounted on the wall. He makes the strides across the large room in record time and plucks his things from the antler-hooks.\n\u201cHe means well.\u201d She repeats her earlier words and Jaskier bites out a loud laugh, cruel-sounding and unbecoming of him.\n\u201cYou say that but does he really? I don't think he means anything at all anymore. He goes on his merry way saying things and I'm supposed to fork through them and pick out the ones that mean something? No, I'm done doing that. I\u2019ve been fine so far and I\u2019ll be fine again.\u201d He throws the cloak over his back and heads for the door. \u201cThe spell better be lifted by the time I leave the city.\u201d It\u2019s an empty threat and Triss knows this as well but she nods all the same.\nThe town is bustling even during nightfall and he should have probably waited for the sun to rise but he\u2019s too angry for that. He needs to leave and he needs to leave at once, Vizima\u2019s never done anyone any good and the people here are miserable anyway so why should Jaskier be any different? He could possibly hunker down in a tavern or an inn for the night but they\u2019d take one look at his lute and his face and demand songs of the great White Wolf and then he\u2019d have to sing lest he give himself a bad reputation and \u2013 well, not tonight.\nHis body is still stiff from lying prone for three days but he powers through the pain, looking for the nearest door out of the city. He\u2019s never been more determined to reach the Free City of Novigrad than he is now.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\nHe fumes on his way out. Fumes all the way down the stone streets and across the muddy puddles as he approaches one of the large gates and crosses the bridge there. Geralt needs to stay out of his business. Jaskier, to a certain extent, understands why Geralt had sent him away \u2013 and he has accepted that. His heart may still long for the boorish man\u2019s company but his mind has made peace with the dismissal. He just wishes Geralt would decide if he cares or not before he gets Jaskier\u2019s hopes up again for no good reason.\n\u201cAnd I was so close to Novigrad, too!\u201d He whines as the xenovox starts making noises at him.\n\u201cHello? Jaskier?\u201d Yennefer voice comes through the line a little creaky and hushed but he hears it all the same. Sighing, he brings the contraption closer to his face and inspects it.\n\u201cHow does this thing work? Do I just yell at it?!\u201d He raises his voice, startling his borrowed horse into a protesting neigh.\n\u201cDon't yell, you idiot, I can hear you fine!\u201d She hisses at him and he pulls his face away from the box.\n\u201cWell, if you can hear me fine then answer me this: what do you want?\u201d He huffs, tired from the day\u2019s travels and not in the mood to talk to Yennefer.\nShe clears her throat very deliberately like she hates to speak the words but she\u2019s going to say them anyway. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard a word from you since Tridam, I'm \u2013 as you say \u2013 'checking in' on you.\u201d \n\u201cHm,\u201d He\u2019s well aware that he sounds startlingly like Geralt when he\u2019s tired \u2013 another bad habit he\u2019d picked up from the Witcher that he hasn\u2019t been able to shake. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll have you know that I'm still doing well for myself, as you put it. Almost a year on my own and I\u2019ve not died yet.\u201d\n\u201cExcept for that time in Vizima,\u201d She snorts inelegantly, \u201cWhere are you now?\u201d\n\u201cSomewhere between Rinbe and Oxenfurt.\u201d He shrugs to himself, he\u2019s about a day away from the town where he\u2019d gone to university but he\u2019s sure that he\u2019ll bypass it entirely for a couple of weeks in Novigrad. \u201cProbably closer to La Valette than Rinbe.\u201d\n\u201cHold still.\u201d Her voice cuts out and he stares at the box incredulously. Hold still?\nHe sees a swirling of air and dirt appear in the crisp spring air and the sudden wavering of the horizon before another scene entirely appears and then Yennefer is stepping out the circle and next to his little campfire. He\u2019s sure he looks like a gawking idiot but he\u2019s not seen this type of sorcery be performed before \u2013 it serves as a good reminder of how powerful Yennefer really is.\nShe looks around his campsite and even looks decently impressed by what she finds.\n\u201cWhere\u2019d you get the horse?\u201d She asks, taking a seat on a fallen log opposite the one he\u2019s leaning against.\n\u201cIt was a gift.\u201d It was.\n\u201cCharmed it out of a young noblewoman\u2019s grasp, I'm sure.\u201d She nods as if in approval.\n\u201cNobleman\u2019s actually. Why are you here, again? And how?\u201d He stows the xenovox into his bag again and leans forward slightly, \u201cI\u2019d offer you refreshments but I'm afraid all I have is water and some oil decidedly not for nutritional purposes.\u201d\nShe scrunches up her face before giving him a deadpan look. \u201cI told you, I was worried.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cAnd that\u2019s very kind of you but haven\u2019t we established that you didn\u2019t have to be worried about me?\u201d He plucks at the lute in his lap idly, strumming a near-silent tune.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard not to be worried about you when Geralt\u2019s hounding me for information all the time.\u201d She rolls her eyes so hard that Jaskier\u2019s surprised they haven\u2019t vacated her skull yet.\n\u201cI hope you haven\u2019t told him anything. Let him stew.\u201d He plucks a particularly bad note and winces, quieting the strings with his palm.\n\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t. Triss told me about your wishes of remaining unseen by his Witcher-y eyes.\u201d She chuckles and procures for herself a cup of wine out of thin air \u2013 now that\u2019s power.\n\u201cThank you, for respecting my wishes.\u201d He nods at her, once again unsure of where the conversation is going.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just funny how \u2013 well, how insistent he is that we keep tabs on you. I tried telling him that you\u2019re doing well on your own and that you don\u2019t need a nursemaid but-\u201d She shakes her head and chuckles. \u201cIt\u2019s funny.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s bloody well annoying, is what it is.\u201d He grunts and bats away the rabbit trying to nibble at the bedroll he\u2019s sitting on.\n\u201cLook, Jaskier...\u201d\n\u201cOh, no. Not that tone!\u201d He brandishes the look as a judge would a gavel in her direction.\n\u201cI will not have you make excuses for him or in his stead. Triss went on about how he means well but does he really? I'm sure you know what I told her and I stand by it. Meanings and actions are very different in reality, Yen. Actions hurt people and meanings can remain unseen by others. I don't want him to know where I am because I'm tired of him treating me like a child!\u201d He almost smacks the lute into the ground but stops himself short of actually doing it like a petulant sprog would.\nSomething akin to understanding crosses her features and her entire demeanor goes soft. \u201cOh, Jaskier.\u201d She croons with a loving smile like a mother looking at a particularly unruly offspring. \u201cGeralt doesn\u2019t know any better. Imagine being told your whole life that you have no feelings, that you don't need anybody and that you never will. And then suddenly that proves to be wrong. How would you feel if someone suddenly took your voice, how did you feel when someone almost did?\u201d\nHe sits back, looking into her violet eyes and contemplates. The Djinn encounter was terrible. He hated not being able to talk and he hated the fact that he wished he\u2019d die rather than lose his voice. It had been truly one of the lowest, most heart-wrenching moments of his life.\n\u201cTerrible, it felt terrible.\u201d He looks away and into the fire. It\u2019s been almost a full year since they\u2019d parted ways and Jaskier had been composing hollowed poems about beautiful men and women that did nothing more than make him feel alone. He\u2019s sure that Geralt\u2019s doing well,though; going about his business of monster hunting but with the occasional detour to ask about Jaskier and his travels \u2013 like he cares.\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t care. You should tell him to stop pestering unsuspecting sorceresses about me. I don't want him looking out for me anymore.\u201d He tosses a few short branches into the fire \u2013 it\u2019s warm enough to sleep without it but it wards off the wolves he\u2019s found so he keeps it lit.\n\u201cWhat do you want him to do, Jaskier? I know that he is sorry for what he said without him having to even say it because he looks miserable every time we cross paths. I don't like seeing him hurt and knowing that you\u2019re better off without him seems to make it worse.\u201d She pinches the bridge of her nose. \u201cI told him of our encounter in Tridam, about how well you were doing. I was impressed, I still am, Jaskier, but he was \u2013 well. Maybe he\u2019d gotten used to the idea of someone needing him, after all. So \u2013 what do you want him to do?\u201d\n\u201cI want him to grovel.\u201d He sneers. \u201cIt\u2019s beneath him to be broken up about what he did. He\u2019s always going on about consequences and whatnot so he should have known better. I'm doing fine, yes, but that doesn\u2019t mean I'm not hurt still. I want him to grovel and beg because it\u2019s his fault.\u201d\nShe seems taken aback, the wine in the cup sloshing as she flinches. \u201cHuh. I didn\u2019t know you had it in you, little bard.\u201d She tilts her head this way and that, from side to side as she thinks his words over. \u201cIf I can talk him into grovelling, will you take him back?\u201d\n\u201cI never had him in the first place.\u201d He crosses his arms over his chest.\n\u201cOh, you\u2019ve had more of him than you even realize, buttercup.\u201d She grins, sharp and confident again, back to her old self mostly. \u201cIf I can convince him \u2013 no underhanded strategies, don't give me that look \u2013 where can he find you?\u201d\n\u201cI'm not ready to face him yet. I'm going to Novigrad where I\u2019ll \u2013 I don't know, loiter around for a few months until I make enough coin or I manage convince some naive nobleman to buy me a cottage on the coast.\u201d He leans back against the log, closing his eyes. \u201cI was thinking about somewhere near Gors Vellen.\u201d\n\u201cHow long do you think it\u2019ll take? For you to be ready, I mean.\u201d She asks again.\nHe hums, a smile curling at his lips. \u201cLet him stew.\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t watch the bard walk away to talk to the rest of the people gathered at the side of the mountain. He fumes at the cards he\u2019s been dealt by everyone around him and remains adamant that most things are Jaskier\u2019s fault in the end.\n\u201cYou\u2019re wrong, you know.\u201d Borch throws on his way down the path, right next to where Geralt is standing silently and stewing in his thoughts.\n\u201cSpare me.\u201d He grunts, not deigning to look at the man as he moves to walk in front of him because Geralt had apparently chosen to stand where the most-travelled road is.\n\u201cI\u2019ll spare you the suffering, my good Witcher, and tell you that it\u2019s not the bard\u2019s fault.\u201d Borch smiles back at him reassuringly with T\u00e9a and V\u00e9a staring at him like he\u2019d done something incredibly stupid from behind the dragon.\n\u201cThough, he doesn\u2019t help out much but when there\u2019s trouble \u2013 he is certainly someone to hold on to.\u201d The man says cryptically and Geralt elects to turn away from him, making his way back to where he\u2019d left Roach.\nIt\u2019s better like this, he decides. The bard was nothing but trouble and even if he didn\u2019t attract it, he certainly never kept himself out of it either. He was loud, annoying, persistent, talked too much and never shut up. He was the wrong sort to be hanging out around Geralt. It is a miracle he hadn\u2019t snapped at the man sooner \u2013 it is a miracle that Jaskier stuck around for as long as he did.\nHe likes travelling alone. He has his swords, his potions and Roach by his side and that\u2019s all that he needs. He didn\u2019t need another burden, he didn\u2019t need the constant chatter or a pesky bard filling his ears and keeping him distracted more often than he\u2019d like to admit.\nHis travels are silent for the first time in months, maybe even years. He purposefully avoids the direction that the bard had gone in and sets off towards the town opposite. He travels on horseback for three days before he comes to a small settlement. They seem to have a problem with Drowners \u2013 much like all the other villages like this do. There\u2019s a swamp nearby that needs to be rid of them so he takes the job and with silence as his companion sets to slashing and slicing.\nOnce he is done he comes back to the people that hired him and they offer him bread and cheese for the road that he accepts. The settlement doesn\u2019t have an inn so he rides out, resigning himself to sleeping in a forest somewhere down the road when his eyelids begin closing. It\u2019s nothing new. He\u2019s been doing this for almost the entirety of his life and if Roach grumbles about the lack of a roof over her head, well, he\u2019ll blame Jaskier for getting her used to cushy inns and good grain.\nShe\u2019ll get used to it, so will Geralt. Things will fall back into place without the bard near him and Geralt will continue doing his job while Jaskier is off somewhere else, alone, possibly in danger and unprotected. Well fuck.\nA few months in, near the Kestrel Mountains, in a tavern in the city of Ghelibol, he hears a song being sung. It\u2019s a familiar tune, the words to it even more so and Geralt hates how his ears almost seem to perk up before he realizes it\u2019s someone else singing his song. He goes into the tavern regardless, just to double check that it\u2019s not Jaskier with a sore throat.\nHe\u2019s an idiot, he realizes, after he lays eyes upon the imposter.\nAn unreasonable amount of anger rises in him and he fights down the urge to hurl his pint of ale across the establishment into not-Jaskier\u2019s head. The man can\u2019t hold a tune to save his life and the words to the song about the slaying of the mighty dragon are changed from when he\u2019d last heard them. And he has heard this particular song before. This entire situation has happened before as well so he controls his breathing and beats himself up over getting his \u2013 what? His hopes up? Why would he hope to come across Jaskier now? Certainly, he should be elated that he\u2019d gone these few months without hearing about the bard much. And yet there he is, the third time in as many weeks that he\u2019d heard one of Jaskier\u2019s songs being sung by someone other than the author.\n\u201cOh, he\u2019s terrible.\u201d He overhears one of the maidens in the corner of the tavern say to two of her friends sitting at the same table.\n\u201cDreadful, really. The author, the real bard, should send his hound after all of the minstrels that try and copy his tune. This is a crime!\u201d The other friend waves a hand around angrily and Geralt shares the sentiment.\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard?\u201d The third one leans closer to the other two conspiratorially. \u201cHe\u2019s travelling alone again. Word has it that he\u2019d gotten bored of the Butcher and left \u2018im.\u201d\nGeralt squeezes the wrist of the hand holding the ale, preventing it from contracting around the pint forcefully and cracking it. Pointlessly destroying tavern property will do no one any good.\n\u201cJust as well,\u201d The first one throws her head back with a haughty laugh. \u201cOne can only write so many songs about Drowners and swamp water before the material runs dry!\u201d All three of them descend into a fit of giggles that would be charming were Geralt not fuming silently.\nJaskier? Gotten bored? Of him? Only his self-preservation stops him from going over there and demanding to know where they\u2019d heard such nonsense.\nHe was the one that sent the bard on his way! He was the one that didn\u2019t need Jaskier depending on him all the time. He\u2019s always been alone and he will be alone again.\n\u201cThat\u2019s an ugly color on you, Geralt.\u201d A familiar voice says to his right and he knows who it is before she even slides to sit across from him.\nHe doesn\u2019t \u2013 he doesn\u2019t know how he hadn\u2019t heard her enter the tavern, how he hadn\u2019t smelled the familiar scent. He hates to think about why that might be \u2013 so he decidedly doesn\u2019t.\n\u201cYen,\u201d He grunts, releasing the pint and flexing his fingers since they\u2019ve gone a little numb from the force of his grip.\n\u201cThis,\u201d She waves a hand in a circle to indicate his face and the expression he\u2019s presumably making, \u201cThe color indignant, it\u2019s unbecoming of you.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you want, Yen?\u201d He sighs, taking a sip of the piss they\u2019re trying to pass off as ale in this wretched tavern. It had gone warm and slightly stale. How long has he been sitting here, angry that the entertainment tonight isn\u2019t Jaskier? And will probably never again be Jaskier?\n\u201cWhy does everyone assume I want something from them?\u201d She huffs, arms crossed over her ample bosom. She looks \u2013 well, she looks good. She always looks good and her eyes are as captivating as ever but if she\u2019s here for a roll in the hay \u2013 he\u2019s afraid that he\u2019ll have to decline.\n\u201cBecause you do?\u201d He looks away as she frowns at him. \u201cWho\u2019s everyone?\u201d\n\u201cI ran into your little bard a few weeks ago.\u201d She grins sharply as Geralt\u2019s gaze snaps back to her, like she\u2019d won some prize playing a game unknown to him.\n\u201cWhere?\u201d His hand spasms against the table, he\u2019s already counting the coin in his purse mentally and preparing to push Roach to whatever town Jaskier was seen last just to \u2013 he pauses. Just to what? Just to rush back to him and demand an explanation? Why haven\u2019t our paths crossed yet after so many years of them constantly interlacing? To demand an apology? What for? Jaskier hasn\u2019t done anything wrong and loathe as he is to admit it, he\u2019d been wrong on that cursed mountain.\n\u201cHe\u2019s doing well.\u201d She continues like he hasn\u2019t spoken at all. \u201cHe was singing at a betrothal banquet. His coin purse was fat and the wine plentiful and flowing into his cup from every pretty maiden that offered it.\u201d Her words are deliberate knives like she knows where all of his weak spots are. And she probably does. It\u2019s just odd that she knows to target all of the ones with Jaskier\u2019s name on them.\n\u201cHe\u2019s doing ... well?\u201d He slumps back against the wall, shrinking away from her vigilant gaze.\n\u201cOh, yes. He\u2019s a right hit with everyone! I always hear stories about how he livens up any place that he enters. He\u2019s positively radiant. We had a nice chat, too. He says he\u2019s been in high demand lately. He\u2019s finally making it out there as the famous bard that he\u2019s always wanted to be. On his own.\u201d She hums, inspecting her nails and then calling over the barmaid to request a cup of wine. \u201cYou seem shocked?\u201d\nHe grunts, at a loss for words \u2013 not like that\u2019s something new. He expected... well, not this. He didn\u2019t expect for Yennefer to come back into his life with words about Jaskier and just how well he was doing \u2013 on his own, without Geralt, without his company or his protection.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be that surprised. He was fine before you showed up, Geralt, of course he\u2019s going to be fine on his own once again.\u201d She chuckles and thanks the barmaid as her wine is brought to her. \u201cI\u2019ll admit, I was a little worried about him after his hasty departure post the whole Dragon Mountains adventure. But it seems that my fears were entirely unfounded. He doesn\u2019t need me, nor you, worrying about him. Imagine that!\u201d\nAh, so Jaskier doesn\u2019t need him after all.\nRealistically, he knows that what she is saying makes sense. The information is logical and the facts given to him all check out but somehow, something inside him doesn\u2019t want to reconcile with the notion that Jaskier is doing fine without him.\n\u201cWhere?\u201d He demands again, face contorting and making Yennefer\u2019s grin even wider. He hates that smile. It makes him feel like \u2013 like she\u2019d somehow won over him. He doesn\u2019t know how or what, but something in that grin is very off-putting.\n\u201cOh, come now, Geralt. Why would you want to know that? You\u2019ve done so well avoiding him so far, I'm sure you\u2019ll do just as fine without knowing his location or final destination.\u201d She tips the cup and drinks the rest of her wine in one go. Standing up, she dusts off her coat and picks up the bag she\u2019s carrying. \u201cHe\u2019s healthy as a horse. He\u2019s fed and watered, well fucked and taken care of. What more could you want for him? I\u2019ll see you around, Geralt. Take care and safe travels.\u201d She waves lightly, her dark hair bouncing as she exits the dingy establishment.\nWas she \u2013 was she here with a purpose? Was that purpose to stir Geralt up? How did she know to do this with information about Jaskier? Is he really that transparent? What is there to be transparent about? Is he going to continue down this river of denial and for how long? Oh, mercy please, someone knock him out cold! So many questions and none of the answers!\nAngrier than he has been in a while, he drops a coin onto the table and shoves his way out of the tavern. As a self-imposed punishment, he decides to camp out in the nearby forest and hunt for that pack of pesky wild dogs a day early.\nIn the few months that he\u2019d been on his own, Geralt had come to a startling realization. It was one that he didn\u2019t like thinking about but had to every time that the silence of the night air became almost unbearable and the feeling of being alone consumed him. But it was his own fault, wasn\u2019t it?\nHe\u2019d complained, he\u2019d pushed and shoved and he was mean and nasty towards the bard and Jaskier had stuck around regardless. And now that he\u2019s gone and Geralt is left to his own thoughts and memories, he loathes admitting that he misses the bard dearly. And that\u2019s the realization that he wants to avoid admitting to himself \u2013 and anyone else \u2013 at all costs. Because Geralt is rarely wrong. He hates being wrong. And admitting that he misses Jaskier\u2019s company (his chatter, his presence) would mean admitting that he had been wrong to send the bard on his way. But most importantly, it would mean that he was wrong in his assumption that life was better without the loudmouthed nuisance by his side.\nBecause Jaskier wasn\u2019t just loudmouthed and annoying. He was, apparently, much more than that \u2013 and Geralt had denied the man opportunity to express everything that he is and can be. In his yellow eyes, Jaskier was a womanizer, a soft-hearted poet that fell in love with anyone and anything deemed beautiful. He chased inspiration, traded muse for muse, undertook travels just to write his next greatest poem \u2013 just to find the one that will make him rich enough. And Geralt understood this. He understood the need to run towards the next job, to go from one town to the next in search of coin and food. He understood this all too well. But he\u2019d apparently misunderstood Jaskier\u2019s willingness to accompany him anywhere he went. And now that they\u2019re no longer travelling together, he won\u2019t get to know Jaskier as anything other than what he\u2019s perceived him as already.\nBecause Jaskier is doing fine without him now.\nWhich in turn means that Geralt had been holding the bard back all this time. That Jaskier could have been rich and fat, nestled in someone\u2019s court by now already had he not dedicated his time and talent to the Witcher. And yet he\u2019d still elected to follow Geralt across the map and into danger. And this confuses him enough to make his head ache. Was the bard not in it for the coin? Jaskier did always insist that they were friends. It seems that Geralt had greatly overestimated Jaskier\u2019s need for protection and inspiration that he found with the Witcher. He\u2019d greatly overestimated Jaskier\u2019s need for him. And that stung. It hurt more than he\u2019d realized and his slow-beating heart twinges with it.\nRoach whinnies as danger approaches and Geralt grips his sword, dragging the end through the dirt idly as his mind whirrs with this new information.\nHe takes a sick sort of satisfaction in dispatching the pack of feral beasts \u2013 the kind he doesn\u2019t experience often. It\u2019s never anything personal, it\u2019s just a job. But he cuts down each of the dogs with a brutality belonging to the feral beast that lies inside him. And luckily, there\u2019s a dog for each one of tonight\u2019s realizations that he can take his frustrations and rage out on.\nJaskier doesn\u2019t need him.\nJaskier doesn\u2019t want him around.\nHe\u2019s the one that finds himself wanting the bard\u2019s company.\nJaskier had been willing to put up with him for so long because of something that still escapes him.\nHe misses the bard greatly.\nHe wants the bard back at his side.\nHe\u2019s possibly never going to have that again and it serves him right.\nBecause he was wrong \u2013 about Jaskier and about what he thought he\u2019s always known.\nAs it turns out, Witchers do have emotions.\nVizima calls for his help. Well, specifically, Triss Merigold calls for his help. A Gryttie has been terrorizing the waters around the city for the past few weeks and they have had enough of the monster\u2019s madness. He takes the job because he\u2019s apparently the only Witcher around that Triss trusts and because it\u2019s strange to see a Gryttie\u2019s so far inland and away from the open seas so something must be amiss. The last one he\u2019d encountered was in the Gulf of Praxeda years ago and that had earned him a nasty scar on his leg.\nAnd well, he owes Triss a fair bit so that only adds to the list of reasons stating why he should accept the job. The list of cons however states: very big, three times your size, rows of sharp teeth, aquatic.\nWell, it\u2019s not like this is the first time in his life that he\u2019d faced troubles that could swallow him whole. So he sets his course to Vizima and arrives there within a few days worth of travel from Carreras where he\u2019d been purging the local forest of a nasty Kikimore infestation.\nTriss welcomes him at the main gates of the city. Sitting poised on her white steed, she looks every bit as regal as any Queen would. She\u2019s beautiful and kind and if Geralt were the sort of man that that settles down \u2013 well. He shakes his head, feeling stupid at the sentiment. He knows who he\u2019d settle down with even if he has to actively avoid thinking about it - him.\n\u201cTriss,\u201d He nods his head in greeting and she smiles at him bashfully.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Geralt.\u201d Triss nods her head in the direction of the castle and they set off on a slow gallop through the bustling streets of Vizima. The looming structure looks imposing in the dying sunlight \u2013 he\u2019s never liked large buildings like this one.\n\u201cYou look well.\u201d He tells her, remembering the last time they\u2019d met and how sad and drained she had looked.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a peaceful couple of years,\u201d She nods, looking away from him and waving to some of the children that are looking up at her in awe from the side of the road.\n\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d And well, he\u2019s not much of a conversationalist. So he doesn\u2019t speak again until they reach the castle.\n\u201cThis Gryttie, do you know how big? Is it an adult or a juvenile?\u201d He asks as they enter one of the man drawing rooms.\n\u201cRight down to business as usual, Geralt?\u201d She chuckles and walks over to the shelf in the corner, procuring a glass chalice of something. \u201cIt\u2019s almost reached adulthood, one row of teeth lacking.\u201d\n\u201cHm.\u201d Fuck, this was going to be exceptionally difficult and will probably fetch him a pretty coin, too. He\u2019ll be able to take low-risk jobs for at least a month before the Temerian copper runs out.\n\u201cI assume you\u2019ll be going in for the kill it from the inside approach?\u201d She takes a sip of her drink but doesn\u2019t offer him any. It\u2019s for the better, he needs a clear head for this and witches' brew is notoriously potent.\n\u201cUnfortunately.\u201d He sighs, rubbing a hand over his face. This is going to be very unpleasant and he\u2019s not sure if it\u2019ll be worth it but \u2013 it is the job and the contract must be fulfilled.\n\u201cOh, right.\u201d She rummages through the bag thrown over her shoulder briefly before she offers him up a small vial of something. \u201cFor your sword, oil it up before you go in. Once it enters the Gryttie\u2019s bloodstream it will slow it down \u2013 digestion and all.\u201d\nHe takes the offered potion and puts it into his bag; this will definitely help. He nods at her. \u201cI will see you when the job is done.\u201d\n\u201cOh! You\u2019re leaving already? Well, er, yes. Be careful, Geralt.\u201d She nods back at him, her hands fiddling with the edges of her sleeves. She seems uncharacteristically nervous this time around and he wonders why that is briefly before deciding that there\u2019s no sense in dwelling on it.\n\u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d He promises, turning around and leaving the castle.\nHe hopes that he doesn\u2019t die. He still has unfinished business in this world that he\u2019d like to eventually attend to. Most of it relates to Jaskier, thought, so maybe he\u2019d be better off being eaten. Now, it\u2019s not his place to be dramatic but he would rather get eaten than swallow his words and apologize. Acknowledging that he was wrong is one thing but admitting so out loud is another entirely.\n\u201cStay here, Roach.\u201d He pats the horse\u2019s neck and the mare nudges him with her head. \u201cTriss\u2019ll take care of you if I don\u2019t come back.\u201d\nWith a heavy heart and a heavier sword, he heads for the waters surrounding the city.\n\u201cFucking \u2013 fuck.\u201d He grunts, shrugging off the heavy leather soaked in blood and water.\nIt had taken an obnoxious amount of time for the thing to show up. For a monster that has apparently been sinking ships as frequently as twice a week, it had chosen a fine time to take a break. So he\u2019d sat in the little boat that was provided for him, waited, slicked up his sword with the oil Triss had provided and then waited some more. Until the thing struck at last\nThe little boat he\u2019d was utterly destroyed in the mess and in the end, he\u2019d been swallowed up by the large beast. Triss had definitely been wrong; it was a fully grown Gryttie. The teeth that had nicked and scraped against him and his armour were all there and the row that was missing appeared to be knocked out forcefully by something \u2013 a battle perhaps. The sea beast were notoriously famous for swallowing parts of ships whole without chewing so maybe that was why. And much like a small ship, he\u2019d slid down the monster\u2019s gullet but unlike the men before him, he was there with his sword up, slicing wherever he could. It was nasty business, trying to cut his way from inside the beast and he hadn\u2019t enjoyed it at all. The stench was almost unbearable and the sounds \u2013 Gods, the sounds were grating and had him wincing with every screech that the monster let out.\nBut he\u2019d done it. He\u2019d located the Gryttie\u2019s beating heart and dispatched of the beast quickly, cutting his way out of the carcass shortly after. He was, of course, covered in guts but thankfully he\u2019d managed to clean off in the lake. He\u2019d made his way to shore, a little worse for wear but alive none the less and that was that.\nThe people still out and about in the city avoid him in a wide arch. It might be because he still reeks of Gryttie innards or maybe because he looks disgruntled enough to send them all scattering away with the force of his glare alone. Either way, he\u2019s glad to be able to pass through the town undisturbed.\nIt takes a while for him to make it up the stairs to where Triss had notified him that his room would be set up. He must be more tired than he\u2019d originally thought. Well, it should be of no surprise to him \u2013 the last time he\u2019d slept properly was months ago. Another plight that he\u2019s brought onto himself, surely.\nThe guards in the castle give him a wide berth as well and maybe being covered in guts isn\u2019t such a bad thing after all. He hopes that either the stench or the knock to the head he\u2019d received allow for a good night\u2019s rest at last.\nOnce he reaches his allotted sleeping quarters he opens up the door and is faced with a large bath in the middle of the room, dug into a stone slab that serves as the tub itself. His chest rumbles with a pleased hum and he starts dropping things, making haste towards the steaming and fragrant water and getting naked fast.\n\u201cOh, Geralt! You\u2019re back!\u201d Triss\u2019 voice echoes through the chamber and he startles.\nIt\u2019s shameful to be caught so off guard yet again. He blames his distraction on the bath and his constant tiredness. He winces and turns to look at her, one foot already in the bathwater.\n\u201cI - the job is done.\u201d He settles on saying, lowering himself into the bath carefully. The wounds he\u2019d sustained protest at the heat but he ignores the pains and aches and indulges himself by leaning back against the edge of the tub and closing his eyes for a moment.\n\u201cYou \u2013 well, I\u2019m not one to beat around the topic. You look a little worse for wear.\u201d Triss approaches him carefully, holding out a little glass bottle of soap for him to use.\n\u201cNothing a bath can\u2019t fix.\u201d He takes the bottle and pours some out into the water before lathering up his hands with the rest.\n\u201cI know you\u2019re used to having handmaids scrub you down but it\u2019s terribly late and they\u2019re all rather scared of you.\u201d She chuckles, taking a seat at the wide brim of the stone tub. \u201cOf, course I could always help out?\u201d\nGeralt\u2019s eyes zero in on her face. She looks bashful but sure of herself. Her demeanour is timid but Geralt can smell the arousal in the air and if it were \u2013 well, if things were different then he would have taken her up on it without a second thought.\nAs it were, he looks away and continues scrubbing himself clean. \u201cMonster hunting is dirty work. I don\u2019t always have people to wash me clean. I\u2019ve learned to make do on my own.\u201d It\u2019s a clear dismissal and her shoulders slump, an incredulous look crossing her face.\nShe clears her throat and leans back a little but remains seated. \u201cDid it give you any trouble?\u201d\nHe raises an eyebrow at her, trying to make her aware of the fact that that was a stupid question without outright saying it. \u201cNo, no trouble at all. The smell is always the worst.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I can tell.\u201d She seems just as taken aback by the terse comment as he is and quickly collects herself. \u201cYou should let me treat that gash on your shoulder once you\u2019re done.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine now but Gryttie\u2019s are known to carry diseases. You\u2019ll let me treat your wounds.\u201d She declares firmly before going over to the table next to the hearth and starts preparing for Geralt\u2019s healing session.\nHe sighs, closing his eyes and dunking his head under the water. Everything is much quieter underneath the surface. When he\u2019s under he doesn\u2019t have to hear the rabbiting of her heart or smell the hurt coming from her. It\u2019s not \u2013 it is his fault. He knows that he\u2019d given her ample reason to think he was interested during their last encounter and he had been interested then. But there was no time back then and now, well, now he\u2019s not sure what exactly is stopping him.\nHe can\u2019t kid himself and say that he\u2019s still mourning the loss of Yennefer when he\u2019d never had her in the first place. What they had together was brief, fleeting, hot and heavy and oh, so short-lived. It was fuelled by passion and circumstance and those never stick around for long. And neither did Yennefer. He was foolish to think that they could have something together. It was obvious from the beginning that she was meant for something else, someone else. He just hopes that she finds whoever that is.\nHe resurfaces with a gasp.\n\u201cAh, good. I was worried you\u2019d drowned.\u201d Triss waves a hand at him, \u201cCome on now, out you go.\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t protest and catches the towel thrown his way. Getting out of the tub is always the worst part because he has to go back to facing the world and currently, his world\u2019s not doing too well.\nHe spies a fresh set of bedclothes laid out on the chair next to the table where she\u2019d worked earlier so he heads there. Well, at least he won\u2019t have to sleep in his leathers and his rough trousers.\n\u201cI\u2019ll get someone to clean the armour for you, don\u2019t worry.\u201d She waves him away as he eyes the set forlornly. \u201cSit and stay bare-chested so that I can do this.\u201d\nHe obeys instructions because there\u2019s a testy note of finality in her tone and he doesn\u2019t wish to anger her further if she\u2019s going to be treating open wounds on his body. He puts the linen pants on and sits down onto the chair. Watching sorceresses work has always been fascinating. She knows her craft and just like the last time she\u2019d treated his wounds, the pain goes away quickly with the application of a few magical words and sweet-smelling salve. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cSo, Geralt.\u201d\n\u201cOh, Gods\u201d He throws his head back with force. He knows this tone; this is the tone Yennefer always used before she started prodding and asking questions. He wonders if it\u2019s a witch thing or if it\u2019s due to their close friendship.\n\u201cSo, Geralt.\u201d She says again with a little more force behind the words this time \u2013 no room for argument. \u201cI see that you\u2019re travelling alone again.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I see that you\u2019ve talked to Yen.\u201d He shoots back, wincing as she digs a finger into one of his wound to clean out the lake gunk still lodged in there.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been in touch, yes.\u201d She confirms, gentling her hands. \u201cI was surprised at first but it makes sense that he would eventually leave your side. You were always terribly mean to him.\u201d\nHer words cut harsher than the teeth of the Gryttie had. Is that what Yennefer had told her? That\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s not what happened at all. \u201cHe didn\u2019t leave on his own. I told him to go.\u201d\n\u201cOh? She might have glossed over that part then. She\u2019d mentioned seeing him briefly and that he was alone. But I\u2019d been hearing about his exploits from the rumour mill. I suppose you can\u2019t trust anyone these days.\u201d She pats his shoulder, indicating that she needs access to his back so he turns sideways in the chair.\n\u201cI sent him on his way.\u201d He repeats, hating how he\u2019s almost growling as he speaks.\n\u201cI see.\u201d She hums, tracing one of his old scars idly before focusing back on the task of bandaging and healing. \u201cAnd why did you do that? Are you not scared that he\u2019ll get in trouble on his own? That he\u2019ll cause some great travesty?\u201d\nOh, she\u2019d definitely talked to Yennefer more than she admits. He knows it and she knows that he knows it. This is a strange game that she\u2019s playing with him now and he feels that he\u2019s going to lose to a sorceress yet again.\n\u201cBecause he never shuts up and only causes trouble. And, apparently, he can take care of himself since he seems to be doing so well.\u201d And there they are, the words as bitter as gull and as darkly intoned as the midnight sky is inky.\n\u201cSo you\u2019re not worried?\u201d She pokes at one of the wounds and he jolts.\n\u201cOf course I\u2019m worried!\u201d He slumps forward, elbows on his knees as Triss pats his back in a comforting manner.\n\u201cWhy not go to him then?\u201d Her voice is light but it pierces his senses because of the words.\nWhy? Well, that\u2019s rather simple.\n\u201cBecause he doesn\u2019t need me. Haven\u2019t you heard? He\u2019s doing fine. Who am I to sully his fun?\u201d He hates thinking about Jaskier off on his own and he hates talking about it even more.\n\u201cBut you need him.\u201d It\u2019s not a question, not really. She\u2019s already made up her mind about the whole situation.\n\u201cI don\u2019t need anyone.\u201d He\u2019s adamant, pigheaded and stubborn as a mule and he\u2019ll die on this hill of self-denial.\n\u201cAnd yet you want him.\u201d She slaps his back cheerfully and twirls away, putting things back into her bag and setting it down by the table.\n\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cAh, but you\u2019re worried regardless. You say you\u2019re not friends, yet you crave his companionship? Well, Geralt, I\u2019d say you\u2019re as dumb as a horse but I\u2019d be insulting Roach if I said that.\u201d She giggles, her earlier incredulity seemingly forgotten. \u201cYou should go to him.\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d He says even as his whole chest caves in at the thought of never hearing Jaskier\u2019s voice again.\n\u201cBut you\u2019ll worry yourself to death if you don\u2019t.\u201d She tilts her head to the side. He\u2019s getting tired of powerful women looking at him like he\u2019s an unruly child. Is this how Jaskier felt by Geralt\u2019s side? Always inferior and ridiculed? He hopes not \u2013 he never meant to make the bard feel that way. And yet, he probably did. To save his own selfish hide \u2013 much good that did.\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll die worrying.\u201d He grunts and puts on the provided shirt. She\u2019s right, he knows she is. It\u2019s one of the reasons that he hasn\u2019t been able to sleep well no matter how tired he is. His thoughts always stray to Jaskier, alone and dead somewhere in some forest or next to some road. It needs to stop, he realizes this. He needs to know that Jaskier is alright or he\u2019ll lose his mind. He needs to see that the bard is taken care of even if Geralt isn\u2019t the one doing the \u2013 oh. Well.\nTriss is holding out a bag of coin for him to take, it\u2019s a hefty sum and he itches to take it but... He has some other form of payment in mind.\n\u201cNo, keep the coin. I need a favour.\u201d He pushes the bag away, certain in what he is going to demand.\n\u201cOh?\u201d She looks intrigued. And she should be \u2013 Witchers aren\u2019t known to trade coin for favour. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cI need you to perform a spell and then I need you to follow through when it activates.\u201d He takes a deep breath and turns away from her imploring eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s a sort of tracking spell, nothing too difficult but it\u2019s fickle because it works for certain intent. I need you to \u2013 for the bard. If his blood is being spilt violently, I need you to help him.\u201d\nShe\u2019s silent for a moment before her face splits into a wide grin. Almost an exact copy of the one Yennefer worse last time. He knows then, that he\u2019d lost the game again.\n\u201cMy, my, Geralt. Truly fascinating.\u201d Her eyes soften then and she cups his cheek gently. \u201cThat\u2019s very noble of you.\u201d\n\u201cHm.\u201d He avoids meeting her gaze. \u201cCan you do it?\u201d\n\u201cOf course I can. It will take a few days but it will be done.\u201d She pats his cheek and picks up her things. \u201cI\u2019ll see you around, Geralt.\u201d She winks at him before leaving the room.\nHe drops into the bed like the dead and for the first time in months, sleeps through the night.\nThere\u2019s still a purse half-filled with coin next to him on the bed in the morning and he takes it because you don\u2019t look a gift horse in the mouth.\nThree months shy of a year since Dragon Mountains and Geralt hears from Triss again through one of the mirrors in a dead sorcerer\u2019s lair. He\u2019s covered in dust and cobwebs and there\u2019s a tear across the thigh of his pants but he answers he call because it seems like the sensible thing to do regardless.\n\u201cHow did you know where to call?\u201d He grunts in lieu of a greeting.\n\u201cA simple location spell.\u201d She smiles. \u201cIt took a while since you\u2019re always on the move but I\u2019d managed.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d He\u2019s giving her the short shrift he knows but he needs to go back and track an assassin across the region and that will take weeks and he\u2019s not looking forward to it. There\u2019s a whole mess to solve here that he\u2019s not looking forward to untangling.\n\u201cThe spell you had me put on Jaskier activated a week and a half ago. I got to him in time, he\u2019s fine now, don\u2019t worry.\u201d She holds up a hand to stop him from talking and then gives him a scathing look like he\u2019d insulted her homeland or something. \u201cHe had me cancel the spell so I thought I\u2019d let you know. No, I\u2019m not going to put it back up and no, I\u2019m not going to tell you where he\u2019s heading. I\u2019ll respect his wishes and keep out of his business.\u201d\nGeralt\u2019s entire body tenses at the information. Jaskier had \u2013 he was in danger. But he\u2019s fine now. But the next time he\u2019s in danger nobody will know and then the bard will die and Geralt will-\n\u201cVizima to Geralt, hello? Anybody in that thick head of yours?\u201d She waves a hand at him, trying to catch his attention but its nigh impossible. \u201cI swear. If I\u2019d known how hurt the bard was by your words and actions I would have never agreed. It was an invasion of privacy on your part, Geralt, shame on you.\u201d Her hands are on her hips and he feels thoroughly scolded like he hasn\u2019t since childhood.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d He chokes out, mind still whirring with the thoughts of Jaskier being hurt and Geralt not being there to help.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not me you should be apologizing to, Witcher.\u201d She scoffs. \u201cSome bandits had jumped him outside of the city. No permanent damage but the stab wound and the cut will leave scars.\u201d She regards him with a cold gaze, \u201cYou truly have no idea, do you?\u201d\n\u201cI am done playing these games with you witches.\u201d He sneers back at her, anger and irritation making him see red.\n\u201cThe only one toying with people here is you, Geralt. It\u2019s time for you to make up your mind.\u201d She turns away, \u201cYou either go to him and apologize or you lose him forever.\u201d\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to see me.\u201d He deflates. He hates feeling this exposed even while fully dressed. All of these women that see right through him, he wonders if he\u2019d always been so transparent or if this is only in regards to Jaskier and his \u2013 feelings.\n\u201cHe may not want to see the you of now and then but \u2013 if you try, maybe he\u2019ll want to see the you of\u00a0 tomorrow. Your heart beats slow but your mind is quick, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll figure everything out.\u201d She regards him once more before sighing. \u201cI have to go, if you need further babying like an infant, I\u2019m sure Yennefer can spare some time.\u201d She waves the image of herself away and then he\u2019s standing there, facing his own reflection in the mirror. He looks a little harrowing.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s amazing how Jaskier had managed to win over the affection of both of these women who\u2019d once been so taken by Geralt himself. And it begs to question, was he the bad guy in this story?\nEugh, he grunts. This is precisely why Witchers don\u2019t get attached.\nThere are so many what ifs and if onlys that surge up inside his head at the mere thought of Jaskier that it always manages to give him a headache. He\u2019s used to the feeling of regret but never had it been this intense before.\nHe\u2019s definitely the bad guy in this story.\nWell, that was horrifyingly easy to decide. It looks like Jaskier had won his affections without Geralt even realizing it, too. Just \u2013 serves him right. All his life alone and hopping from bed to bed only to have his entire worldview shifted by a mouthy bard with sky-blue eyes and the voice of a siren.\nNow, what to do with this horrifying information?\nWell, one thing\u2019s for certain \u2013 he does need more babying so he will try and track Yen down and talk to her about it. Though, he doesn\u2019t know what good that will do him. She\u2019s as emotionally repressed as he is.\u00a0 \u00a0\nSighing, he exits the cave complex. Sadly, his quest to track down Yennefer will have to wait until this mission is over. He can only hope that Jaskier doesn\u2019t get into any more trouble while he\u2019s busy.\nBut \u2013 but that\u2019s not fair, is it? The bard had been doing well on his own and this one incident was probably a lapse in judgement on the bard\u2019s part when picking a road to travel. So \u2013 so Jaskier will be fine. Geralt believes this now. He knows what he did wrong and if he\u2019s ever to accompany Jaskier anywhere again, he\u2019ll need to start admitting it, too.\nIt takes him a month to finish the job and track Yennefer down. And when he does, she\u2019s in a heap of trouble as well.\n\u201cAre you sure you asked them nicely?\u201d He grunts, ducking away from an incoming arrow.\n\u201cYes, and they refused so I took it anyway.\u201d She throws a blast or something at their pursuers and the explosion has Geralt\u2019s sensitive ears ringing.\n\u201cWhat do you even need it for?\u201d He tugs her behind a corner so that she can open a portal out of the mess they\u2019d found themselves in.\n\u201cI need it for a spell.\u201d She looks away, cheeks uncharacteristically pink and that makes him wonder.\n\u201cHm.\u201d He follows her through the portal that she\u2019d opened and they step out into a meadow of some kind, the ruby in her hand gleaming brightly in the midday sun.\n\u201cNot that I don\u2019t appreciate the help but \u2013 you\u2019ve hounded me down with a reason in mind, have you not?\u201d She puts the ruby into a small purse and sits down onto the soft-looking grass. She pats the space next to her expectantly and he relents and sits down as well.\n\u201cI \u2013 you know where Jaskier is, I need to go find him.\u201d There\u2019s no sense in avoiding the topic when the both of them know why he\u2019s here.\n\u201cLast I remember, and last Triss told me, he doesn\u2019t want to be found.\u201d She plucks out a couple of cornflowers from a nearby bushel and starts weaving them together. \u201cSo tell me, why should I betray the trust of a friend?\u201d\n\u201cSince when are you friends?\u201d He ignores the surge of unfounded jealousy.\n\u201cWe\u2019re more alike than he knows and I\u2019m not afraid to admit that he\u2019s good company.\u201d She wrinkles her nose at him, very judging.\nHe grunts, trying to duck away as she tries to pin the little wreath of flowers into his hair. The color reminds him of Jaskier\u2019s eyes too much which is why he eventually lets her braid them into his white strands.\n\u201cI want to apologize to him, Yen. I want \u2013 I want to do better.\u201d He sighs, knowing he sounds dejected and beaten down.\n\u201cI know.\u201d She pats his knee reassuringly but it comes off as a little condescending. \u201cBut I\u2019m still not going to tell you. You hurt him, Geralt, more than you know. And he\u2019s gotten over it mostly but the heart wants what the heart wants, I suppose. I\u2019m certain he\u2019ll forgive you, but not yet.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d He turns to fully look at her.\nHer eyebrows shoot into her hairline. \u201cThe \u2013 you\u2019re joking, right? You\u2019re not joking.\u201d She throws her head back in a wail of despair that\u2019s entirely too dramatic. \u201cYou don\u2019t know. You don\u2019t know and yet you\u2019re willing to crawl back to him. Oh, this is too pure.\u201d\n\u201cYen, you\u2019re scaring me.\u201d He deadpans, wondering what had gotten into her to have her acting like a giddy child. \u201cI want to \u2013 I want to apologize and tell him that I\u2019d like to be his friend, that I liked being his friend. Even if only his friend.\u201d\n\u201cOh, my sweet oaf.\u201d She cups his cheek much like Triss had. \u201cIt\u2019s not my place to enlighten you on this so I won\u2019t. But you keep your hopes up because it\u2019ll be worth it. I\u2019ll talk to him, see if he\u2019s willing to forgive yet. I expect you to respect his wishes regardless.\u201d Standing up and dusting herself off, \u201cNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me I have some jewellery to craft.\u201d\n\u201cI thought it was for a spell?\u201d He smiles despite himself.\n\u201cOf a sort, yes.\u201d She winks and then opens up a new portal. \u201cWell, off you go, Roach is waiting.\u201d\n\u201cWhere will I find you next?\u201d He asks, stepping through the portal.\n\u201cI\u2019ll find you.\u201d She waves and before she closes the portal he manages to throw in a quick please, look after him that he\u2019s not sure if she heard.\nRoach whinnies at him, bumping him from the back. He chuckles lowly and turns around to pat her on the head. \u201cI know, girl, I know.\u201d\nHe goes about his life. He continues doing jobs and dies a little on the inside every time he hears Jaskier\u2019s songs being played by someone other than his bard himself. He stocks up on coins because he refuses to indulge himself in the pleasures of the carnal kind and spends only what he must to keep his swords sharp and Roach and himself fed.\nAnother month passes before he hears from Yen again. He\u2019s somewhere in an inn in the region of Cintra. He\u2019s soaking in his first bath in two weeks and enjoying himself with this basic indulgence. He\u2019s dozing off when the air starts swirling into a familiar circle. He straightens up and tilts his head.\n\u201cYou\u2019re awfully close to the city of Cintra.\u201d Yennefer enters the room, boots thudding against the hardwood floors.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be leaving soon. No sense in tempting fate.\u201d He still shudders at the thought of the Child Surprise. \n\u201cI bring news from our beloved friend, the bard.\u201d She throws her arms open with a bright grin and Geralt spies a little emerald glistening against the dark material clipped around her throat that\u2019s new.\nHe sits up, the water sloshing as he stands to attention. \u201cAnd?\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d She clicks her tongue. \u201cYou, my good Witcher, have impeccable taste in both men and women.\u201d She\u2019s \u2013 she sounds proud of all the things and Geralt slumps back down in confusion.\n\u201cI\u2019d managed to get some free time so that I could track him down. I was rather busy, you know. And well, we had a nice chat. He\u2019s really something else.\u201d She taps her chin and paces in a tight circle.\n\u201cYen.\u201d He grunts, impatient and ready to act.\n\u201cI put in a good word for you, don\u2019t worry. But he doesn\u2019t seem to have believed me when I said that you were ready to apologize.\u201d She laces her fingers together over her stomach before making a grand gesture and taking a bow. \u201cAnd now, for the main event. Our little songbird has talons, my dear Witcher. I asked him what it would take for him to believe that you were sorry and you know what he said?\u201d\n\u201cOut with it, Yen.\u201d\n\u201cHe said that you need to grovel, Geralt. You need to get on your knees and beg and he said it with such vitriol that I\u2019d almost jumped him right then and there!\u201d She takes a step back as he surges up from the tub, angry and possessive like a mindless beast at her empty words.\n\u201cGrovel?\u201d He grinds out, teeth gritting together and fists clenched.\n\u201cOh, yes. Because he thinks that you won\u2019t do it. He knows that apologizing is beneath you so he\u2019s convinced that it\u2019ll put you off and save him further pain.\u201d She walks over to the bed and sits down, making herself comfortable.\n\u201cI \u2013 it\u2019s not beneath me.\u201d He mumbles, looking down at himself with a frown. Maybe he should put some clothes on.\n\u201cI know that, now. But he doesn\u2019t. So you need to show him. And, if you ever want to be more than friends well \u2013 then I suggest you get on your knees for more than just begging, Witcher.\u201d\n\u201cYen!\u201d He barks, ashamed at how heat surges through him at the thought.\nWell, it\u2019s not like he wouldn\u2019t do it. Not like he hadn\u2019t wanted to do it before. Not like he hadn\u2019t wondered what it would be like to-\n\u201cNo need to get excited just yet.\u201d She throws a towel at him and he dutifully wraps his waist in it. \u201cFor I bear bad news as well.\u201d\nA chill running down his spine kills any arousal that he might have felt only a moment prior. He nods but remains silent, waiting for the final judgement.\n\u201cHe\u2019s not ready to hear you out yet. He said a couple of months in Novigrad and then \u2013 well, then you can go and seek him out if you so desire. But not yet.\u201d She kicks her feet out and bounces back up.\n\u201cOf course, the coast.\u201d He closes his eyes as grief consumes him. Jaskier always talked about the coast and the cities there. He loved the sea and the warm weather, the breeze and the way the sun would reflect on the waves.\n\u201cGive him a little more time, Geralt. And then go to him. And do everything in your power not to lose him again because chances are that you\u2019re going to do something idiotic again and the next time, I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll forgive.\u201d She pats his bare chest and goes for the door.\n\u201cYen.\u201d He calls out, a lump in his throat. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\u201cEveryone deserves a bit of happiness, Geralt.\u201d She says with a nod and leaves the room.\nHe doesn\u2019t think about going to Novigrad, not really. He thinks about how much city life fits Jaskier and about how the bard would do well to settle into a court somewhere for a full-time job. He thinks about all of the things Jaskier had sacrificed for him and about how little he\u2019d gained in return.\nYes; Geralt was definitely the villain of the story and now \u2013 now it was time for his redemption arc.\nNovigrad was good. Novigrad was something new and yet something so familiar. It brought back memories of his youth that he\u2019d forgotten. Well, not like it\u2019d been that long since he\u2019d last been there but sometimes, Jaskier felt like it had been a lifetime. Novigrad was a thriving community of diverse personalities, assorted individuals, contrasting simpletons and so much more. It was as colourful as it was dreary. And much like any large city, it has its city districts that vary one from another just as much as its citizens do.\nJaskier was aware of this going in, and he planned on using it to his advantage. So once he sets foot into Novigrad, a year and a week after he\u2019d left Geralt\u2019s side, he gets to work.\nHe charms his way into singing in one of the taverns by the docks called the Bottomless Barrel and spends a few weeks going between that particular tavern and an inn a few streets into one of the nicer parts of the city. Once word gets out that he\u2019s in town, the demand for his songs becomes greater but he keeps his job as semi-permanent entertainment at the Bottomless Barrel and sings there for the fishermen and for anyone willing to spare a coin. The owner gives him a room above the tavern once it\u2019s clear that the amount of business that he brings in is worth it and he settles down there for the moment.\nHe still takes the odd invite to sing here and there across the city and people follow him wherever he goes. The ability to attract an audience when it matters has always been one of Jaskier\u2019s best selling points so he utilizes it whenever he can. And maybe this sort of thing wasn\u2019t that desirable out there in the real world but here in the walls of the Free City, well, people pay a pretty coin for his talents.\nHe gets commissioned to write poems for lowly noblemen who aren\u2019t equipped with the talent or brains but do want what\u2019s between their loved one\u2019s legs and he accepts. He might as well utilize someone else\u2019s love as inspiration since his own had grown jagged and rough. He writes songs for the townsfolk and he writes poems for the poor fools in Oxenfurt when they can\u2019t come up with any of their own.\nAround the two months\u2019 mark, one of the Big Four calls for him and he has no choice but to accept the call and head towards Francis Bedlam\u2019s court. The Putrid Grove, or The Garden of Liberty, is an enclave in the district of Lacehalls within Novigrad. It\u2019s a refuge to those who escaped the Witch Hunts and it\u2019s not a place Jaskier had frequented before. All things considered, Francis was rather altruistic. And his Grove was near where Jaskier had been living so it was a wonder that it had taken that long for him to be summoned.\nFrancis hires him to sing at one of his celebrations and Jaskier earns more coin that night than he has in a while. He stows it all under one of the creaky floorboards in his room and bides his time until he can buy a little house on the coast.\nThe King of Beggars still calls him back on occasion and Jaskier makes the required coin much sooner than he\u2019d expected. And yet he sticks around.\nFive months in and he\u2019s still inexplicably attached to the small room above the Bottomless Barrel and the little nest of swallows that\u2019s nestled into the corner of his window. He feels safe in the city \u2013 despite getting beaten up once or twice during his stay. He feels like he can stay there and maybe write those memoires he\u2019s always talking about.\nBut \u2013 but the city doesn\u2019t bring peace to his rattled heart so he informs the owner of the Barrel that he\u2019ll be taking his leave.\nThe man is sad to see him go but accepts the decision with a good-natured pat on the back. Jaskier knows that it must be tough to lose your main entertainer but such is the way of life. Sometimes you lose the things that bring you joy and you just have to live with it.\nSo he picks up his things, his bags of coin and the horse he\u2019d borrowed and heads for Gors Vellen.\nHe hates that his heart constantly tugs him towards the coast, towards the place he heeds from but he\u2019s always followed his heart anyway so why should this be any different? He doubts that he\u2019ll spend the rest of his days in the cabin he will eventually procure. But it will be a nice place to settle down in alone for a while.\nWord of his arrival at Gors Vellen spreads fast and he is called to court in order to perform for the local nobility and Jaskier has learned that refusing nobility anything is never a good idea.\nUnfortunately, the word spreads as far as Kerack and Cidaris so people from all over there come and see him as well. It\u2019s a mess that lasts for three days and by day three, Jaskier is tired enough to slink away with his coin and head for one of the coastal villages. He wishes he could have had time to scout the area first but \u2013 he\u2019s always been good at making things up on the fly.\nSurprisingly, Yennefer is the first visitor that he gets.\nShe shows up at his door, two months after he\u2019d settled into the cottage, and shoves a bottle of wine at him before entering the house without a word.\nShe looks around the room that that holds a moderate hearts with an oven, two tables and four chairs, some shelves and a rack for his lute, with a critical eye before nodding in approval.\n\u201cHumble, not entirely unexpected.\u201d She voices and then takes a seat at the table.\n\u201cHello, Yennefer! No, no it\u2019s so nice to see you, yes I\u2019ve been well? How have you been? Good? That\u2019s excellent to hear!\u201d He waves his hands around as he pretends to hold a proper conversation with her and she watches with amusement in her eyes. She looks \u2013 well, kinder than the last time he\u2019d seen her and he wonders why this is.\n\u201cYes, I'm doing well, too, Jaskier.\u201d She chuckles and he opens up the bottle, pouring them each a cup.\n\u201cWhat brings you to my humble abode, O\u2019 Powerful One?\u201d He sits opposite to her, one leg propped up on the seat of his chair and his elbows on the table.\nShe eyes his twisting form with a smile, \u201cI wanted to see if you were settling in.\u201d\nHe sweeps a hand out around the room. \u201cAs you can see, I have everything that the heart desires.\u201d He winces immediately after; the topic of one\u2019s heart is always a sore one.\nThe skittering of nails against wood distracts Yennefer from what she was about to say next and he watches her eyes light up as his dog, Butters, comes bounding into the room with his tail wagging.\n\u201cJaskier! Who\u2019s this handsome little fellow?!\u201d She croons and drops out of the chair, hands scratching the dog\u2019s scruff with care and enthusiasm.\n\u201cHis name is Butters. He came by one day looking for food and stole the nearest neighbour\u2019s chicken so I paid the man for the chicken and saved him from getting cleaved in half by the old grouch.\u201d He shrugs, whistling briefly before the dog runs to his side. \u201cWatch this.\u201d He ambles over to the wall and picks up his lute.\nHe strums a few cords and starts up a low hum of a familiar tune and Butters starts howling with him. Yennefer cackles, her smile radiant as she claps.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a natural! Soon he\u2019ll run you out of the business!\u201d She pats her knees and the dog wiggles his way back towards her. \u201cHe\u2019s so cute.\u201d She coos and scritches under the dog\u2019s white maw. \u201cLooks a bit like a wolf, don't you think?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve noticed but he hasn\u2019t eaten me yet, so I'm holding out hope.\u201d He chuckles and takes a sip of the wine. It\u2019s the good, expensive kind he hasn\u2019t had since he\u2019d left Novigrad. He hums in approval.\n\u201cYou know, I caught one of your performances back in Gors Vellen while I was in town.\u201d She sits back up but keeps one hand on the dog\u2019s head, still petting the soft fur. \u201cYou look much better now than you did then. I like the,\u201d She motions to his head and the hair that had grown out a little without him cutting it. \u201cLook.\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t planning on performing in Gors Vellen, let alone for three days.\u201d He sighs, relaxing into the chair. \u201cThey\u2019d caught me off guard and while the pay was good, I needed a break.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d made quite the name for yourself, Jaskier.\u201d She hums, tilting her cup towards him as if to congratulate his success.\nHe rubs the back of his head, feeling uncharacteristically shy about it. He supposes praise that comes from tentative friends means more than the praise of strangers stroking his ego. \u201cI guess I have. Though, I'm taking my dramatic break at the moment so you can only hear my songs sung by others for now.\u201d\n\u201cAh, are you sure I can\u2019t hire you for a private performance?\u201d She purrs and he feels the tips of his ears heat at the words. She notices, of course, and chuckles. \u201cRelax, songbird, I'm otherwise engaged.\u201d She taps the ribbon nestled around her throat that has a gleaming emerald on it and he leans forward to inspect it better. The emerald is surrounded by elegant filigree of silver and it looks like it cost more than Jaskier\u2019s house had.\n\u201cWell I\u2019ll be thrice damned! Congratulations, Yen, I'm \u2013 I'm glad.\u201d He smiles, feeling warm and giddy because one of his friends is finally being treated right. \u201cOh, you must let me write a song about it! It\u2019s going to be a sprawling ballad with highs and lows! Maybe I make an appearance in it! Oh!\u201d He taps his hands against the table excitedly, inspiration striking even without knowing exactly who she\u2019s betrothed to.\n\u201cYou\u2019re almost as happy as I was,\u201d She smiles a cheeky little smile, so very genuine that makes him wish he were better at painting so that he could capture it forever.\n\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I be? With the live you\u2019ve lived \u2013 it\u2019s not every day something so marvellous happens! You deserve to be happy, Yen.\u201d He leans back and reaches to fetch his notebook and quill. His hands are itching to start writing again \u2013 this is the most excitement he\u2019s gotten in weeks now. His last song was about Butters and how lucky he is to be able to lick his own balls.\n\u201cYes, I do. And so do you, Jaskier.\u201d She leans forward and laces her hands onto the table. \u201cIs it time? Is the stew done cooking?\u201d\nHe sighs deeply before inhaling sharply. His fingers tap against the notebook that holds most of his personal works erratically as he looks around the little cabin he\u2019d worked so hard for.\nIt was easy to forget his woes once he\u2019d had an established routine of singing, writing and entertaining. It was easy to get lost in the streets of Novigrad and in all of the people around him. It was almost easy to not think about Geralt \u2013 mostly during the day. It was easy to busy himself with the dog he\u2019d adopted and the horse he\u2019d borrowed and the little garden at the back of the house that he tended to. But he\u2019s always known that his busywork wouldn\u2019t mend his heart.\nHe thinks about the man now, though, about his cat-like eyes and his white hair, his barrel chest and his deep voice. He thinks about how Geralt sacrifices so much for the people he serves and how unfair it is that they put so much pressure on him. He knows Geralt\u2019s had a life like he couldn\u2019t even imagine but \u2013 but he\u2019s still firm in his belief that the Witcher needs to apologize.\nBut he\u2019d also be lying if he said that he didn\u2019t miss the idiot brute. He missed travelling a little as well. He\u2019d forgotten how hectic city life could be. Out there in the wilderness, under the stars, everything is so much calmer. It was easier to compose in the silence, easier to write when you\u2019re not burdened by the eyes of others on your back \u2013 easier when your muse is right there next to you.\nButters scampers over to him and puts his paws on his thigh. He smiles at the white dog, \u201cHey, boy.\u201d He smooches him on the forehead and gets a hearty lick on the cheek in turn.\n\u201cI know you\u2019ve already got one white wolf in the house but is there room for one more?\u201d Yennefer grins and Jaskier can\u2019t help but laugh.\n\u201cYou know, if you try a little harder, you might be able to teach the other one some tricks too.\u201d She tacks on with chuckle and an eyebrow wag.\n\u201cYen!\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t get many visitors, even less of the ones that come knocking instead of snooping around the back and trying to steal his carrots or poison his horse out of jealousy.\nSo when he hears a knock on the door, three months after his last visitor that was Yen came around, he naturally assumes it\u2019s her again. But when he opens the door he\u2019s met with a leather-clad chest and the tight line of Geralt\u2019s shoulder.\n\u201cOh.\u201d He takes an involuntary step back \u2013 he\u2019d almost forgotten how imposing Geralt could be at times with all that bulk on his frame. Butters barks from the bedroom and Geralt\u2019s eyes zero in on the door to it across his shoulder momentarily before he\u2019s meeting Jaskier\u2019s gaze again.\n\u201cHello.\u201d Geralt\u2019s voice grits like he hadn\u2019t spoken in weeks and Jaskier, much to his embarrassment and dismay, feels his knees trying to buckle like he\u2019s a fair maiden.\n\u201cGeralt.\u201d He crosses his arms over his chest and leans against the doorway for stability. \u201cWhat brings you to this neck of the \u2013 coast?\u201d\nGeralt\u2019s jaw works as he tries to come up with the words to respond with. It\u2019s amusing watching him concentrate and carefully pick and choose from what little vocabulary he has. And for Jaskier\u2019s consideration, too! Admirable.\n\u201cI \u2013 wanted to see you.\u201d Geralt settles on saying and Jaskier really hadn\u2019t been expecting that. For Geralt to say that he wanted to apologize? Maybe. But for Geralt to just admit that he missed seeing him enough to track him down \u2013 albeit, not in as many words? Never. \u00a0\n\u201cWell,\u201d He straightens up and curtsies for the Witcher dramatically. \u201cHere I am. Jaskier of Lettenhove, Bard Extraordinaire.\u201d\n\u201cHm,\u201d Geralt grunts like he\u2019s irritated but his face is open for the first time since possibly the Cintra incident. And worst of all \u2013 he\u2019s smiling. How is Jaskier supposed to combat that?\nHe clears his throat, still adamant to try and remain impartial to the other\u2019s presence. \u201cAnd now you\u2019ve seen me. I have to go feed my dog.\u201d He turns to walk back inside but stops at the sound of Geralt\u2019s voice calling his name.\n\u201cJulian.\u201d There are two thumps against the wood and he turns towards the sound slowly.\n\u201cWhat \u2013 what are you doing?\u201d He hisses, looking around futilely to see if anyone\u2019s in danger of seeing this because \u2013 Geralt is kneeling on his front porch, thick thighs spread and his hands resting on them almost peacefully.\n\u201cI\u2019m \u2013 grovelling.\u201d \u00a0Geralt responds and Jaskier startles, arms flapping out in distress.\n\u201cYou-\u201d His voice fails him for the first time since he\u2019s learned how to talk at the early age of five months. And it\u2019s because of Geralt. This ridiculous, gorgeous, dumb buffoon who\u2019s kneeling in front of him doing something he\u2019d told Yennefer he wanted from him in a fit of petty spite.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Geralt says lowly. \u201cI was wrong. I was wrong and it was wrong of me to send you away like that.\u201d\n\u201cYes, you were. And yes, it was.\u201d He confirms, falling back into being stoic now that he knows Geralt is willing to face what he\u2019d done.\nIt\u2019s odd \u2013 he used to think that he\u2019d forgive Geralt immediately upon hearing those words like a lovesick farmhand. But right now, as he\u2019s hearing them \u2013 well, he\u2019s only thinking about how shitty he\u2019d felt and how condescending Geralt was towards him most of the time. He\u2019s promised himself that he would not be a fool again so Geralt will have to try better than this. Because the Witcher isn\u2019t good with words but he\u2019s only infinitesimally better with actions. Willingly kneeling at Jaskier\u2019s feet is a good start but it\u2019s not enough. Because Geralt knows only harsh words and non-reactions and he\u2019s going to have to learn.\nAt least knowing you did something wrong was a step in the right direction.\n\u201cWell, it was good to see you.\u201d This time he does go back inside and even closes the door. He goes about cooking lunch and doing his chores and tries to ignore the fact that he can still see Geralt\u2019s shadow from under the door. He doesn\u2019t sing that night like he usually would, doesn\u2019t give Geralt the satisfaction of hearing him. \u00a0\nThe shadow stays there until the sun goes down but Jaskier stays firm in his decision.\nNot even a couple of turns of the hourglass later, Yennefer contacts him via xenovox as he\u2019s lounging in his large bed with a cup of wine in his hand.\n\u201cWell, I have to say, you keep surprising me, little songbird.\u201d Her voice makes him startle and he scrambles across the room to dig out the box from one of the chests.\n\u201cAlready?\u201d How? He whines, a little embarrassed about \u00a0being so difficult for everyone to deal with.\n\u201cI\u2019m hiding out in Gors Vellen.\u201d She doesn\u2019t sound happy about it and he can\u2019t blame her, it\u2019s not a pretty town.\n\u201cEnough about me, though. You sent him on his way, huh?\u201d She huffs out a laugh and he rolls his eyes, she sounds entirely too amused by all of this.\n\u201cYes, well. If he comes back again, I\u2019ll think about it.\u201d He lies back down, rolling onto his back and staring at the rafters of his thatched home.\n\u201cGood. You should make him work for it. You said you wanted him to grovel-\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think he\u2019d actually do it! He got down on his knees and everything!\u201d His voice pitches high enough that it makes Butters whine from the foot of the bed.\n\u201cOh! He didn\u2019t tell me that part!\u201d There\u2019s a sound that isn\u2019t unlike that of a bottle being opened and he wonders when they\u2019d both become middle-aged, noblewomen trapped in loveless marriages drowning their sorrows in wine.\n\u201cHe did. Gods, I don\u2019t \u2013 that almost had me, I have to admit.\u201d He chuckles and Yennefer hums like she knows exactly what he means. Well, she probably does.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to come back, you know. He cares enough to do that.\u201d\n\nHe sighs, \u201cI know. I hope so.\u201d\nButters wakes him up by barking very loudly very early in the morning of the next day. It has to be just after sunrise when the dog starts yapping at the front door and startles him out of a rather pleasant dream.\n\u201cYou damn mutt.\u201d He grumbles and rolls out of bed with a heavy heart. The dog just probably wants a piss so he should do the responsible thing and let the poor animal out.\nHe runs a hand through his hair and scratches at his chin where a fair bit of scruff had grown to cover his face. It\u2019s still warm out but it\u2019s going to get cold sooner than he\u2019d like and being by the sea already gives the house a chill during the night so he\u2019s looking forward to going back and sleeping some more in his warm bed.\n\u201cYes, yes. I\u2019m coming.\u201d He hits his hip on the corner of the table in the front room and winces at the bruise that\u2019s sure to sprout there in a couple of hours.\n\u201cOut you go, you beast.\u201d He unlocks the door and tugs it open violently. But the dog doesn\u2019t move, just keeps barking and growling by his knees.\n\u201cHe seems lovely.\u201d The rumbling voice from the other side gives him a fright and the yell he lets out is very undignified.\n\u201cGeralt! Monkey\u2019s arse, don\u2019t do that!\u201d He grips at his chest where his heart is making a valiant effort of bursting out of his body.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I wasn\u2019t expecting you to be awake.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s creepy, you weird, weird man!\u201d He stomps his foot down and Butters snaps his maw shut, looking up at him with wide, blue eyes. \u201cNot you, sweetheart. I\u2019d never yell at you.\u201d He croons and bends down to give his best boy his customary forehead smooch.\n\u201cYou got a dog.\u201d Another non-reaction from Geralt. He\u2019s always been very good at those.\n\u201cYour skills of observation remain unparalleled. I also have a horse; his name is Yaruga, like the river.\u201d He waves down at the dog, \u201cThis is Butters.\u201d\n\u201cHm.\u201d And then, again, Geralt gets down on his knees but this time he holds out a hand for Butters to sniff at. The traitorous hound starts wagging his tail and approaches Geralt like the happy little beast that he is, all too glad to get pets from strangers.\n\u201cYou \u2013 harlot.\u201d He snorts, turning back inside to pick up the water bucket \u2013 he might as well get on with his day, it\u2019s not like he\u2019ll be able to sleep now.\n\u201cHe\u2019s \u2013 nice.\u201d Geralt comments and well \u2013 there Butters is, on his back, letting Geralt rub his belly.\n\u201cHe\u2019s well behaved.\u201d He says with squinted eyes, wondering if Geralt will take the hint. He walks over back to the two and thrusts the bucket out to the Witcher. \u201cGo find the well and fill up the bucket.\u201d He doesn\u2019t say more as he drops it next to Geralt and whistles for Butters to come back inside.\nHe doesn\u2019t look but he hears Geralt ambling away to try and locate the watering hole that Jaskier visits on most mornings and some nights. It\u2019s a little ways away and he\u2019d developed a solid set of arm muscles hauling the water and wood from the woods but he doesn\u2019t think Geralt will have any issues with it.\n\u201cYou \u2013 you\u2019re a traitor, you know that?\u201d He points an accusing finger at Butters but the dog just opens up his mouth and lets his tongue loll out innocently. \u201cYou\u2019re so lucky you\u2019re cute.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a little stable out by the garden where Yaruga resides and the horse neighs as he approaches with the bag of oats. \u201cYes, yes. I\u2019m here. Hold your horses, ha ha.\u201d He chuckles and runs a hand up the horse\u2019s dark head. He proceeds to feed the steed while humming a song low in his throat only for the animals and the nature around him to hear.\n\u201cYou \u2013 are a gorgeous beast.\u201d He says to the horse and Yaruga bumps him with his head. Talking to animals is another thing that he\u2019d picked up from Geralt but this one he\u2019s not sorry that he did. He\u2019d have gone half mad if he didn\u2019t talk to his two beastly companions on a daily basis.\nA throat is cleared somewhere behind him and he does his best not to startle this time. His back does go a little tense in surprise but he rolls his shoulders to relax it.\n\u201cWhere \u2013 should I put this?\u201d Geralt hold out the bucket and Jaskier rolls his eyes.\n\u201cPour it into the trough there,\u201d He motions to where Yaruga\u2019s water is running a little low.\nYes, he thinks as he watches Geralt do as he\u2019s told, this\u2019ll do for now. \u201cNow go fill the bucket again, I need to water the garden.\u201d\n\u201cYou do this every day?\u201d Geralt looks to the fenced-off garden and the stacks of hay in the pen next to Yaruga\u2019s and then back at Jaskier.\n\u201cThis is the last of the vegetables. The season\u2019s turning is near. But yes, I\u2019ve been doing this ever since I planted the garden and settled down here.\u201d He whistles shortly again and Butters bolts outside of the house, very excited to be out and about in the morning air.\n\u201cHm.\u201d\n\u201cEloquent.\u201d He scoffs and turns towards the shoreline. This is one of the reasons that he\u2019d wanted this house in particular even if it was a little worn when he\u2019d first procured it. The view was stunning and walking along the beach was always a treat.\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2013 impressive.\u201d Geralt finally amends and Jaskier turns to him with a nod.\n\u201cThank you.\u201d He hates how the praise affects him, fills him with warmth. He\u2019s still so gone on the man and the absence only made the heart grow fonder despite the anger simmering there alongside the admiration and adoration.\nYaruga whinnies as Geralt leaves again and he takes a couple of strands of the horse\u2019s dark mane to braid. \u201cHe\u2019s alright, you know. I know he stinks of death but he\u2019s \u2013 alright. No need to get testy.\u201d\nThe second time Geralt returns with the water, Jaskier instructs him on how to water the plants and in which order.\n\u201cNot on the leaves, you dolt, once the sun hits they\u2019ll wilt! Careful with the radishes.\u201d He points to a patch of small green leaves and Geralt shoots him a look that he counters with a raise of his eyebrows. Geralt swallows his words and carefully pours half a cup under each little sprouting of leaves.\nOnce they\u2019re done with that and Geralt had brought down another bucket, he pats the Witcher\u2019s chest and shoos him away.\n\u201cThank you, that was very helpful. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d He closes the door in Geralt\u2019s face yet again and feels a little better about it this time.\nBecause Geralt came back. And he helped Jaskier take care of his garden. And most importantly, he listened to what Jaskier said without complaining.\nMaybe he\u2019s not ready to hear Geralt\u2019s voice yet but he\u2019s definitely ready to see him grovelling for a little longer.\nThe next morning he wakes to the sound of someone in his house. He has enough wits about him to grab the short sword he\u2019d purchased in Gors Vellen when one of his neighbours tried to steal his horse before he heads out into the front room.\n\u201cYou useless cur!\u201d He chastises Butters who\u2019s lounging by the fire burning in the hearth.\n\u201cHe put up a valiant effort until I bribed him with food.\u201d Geralt shoots him a glance from the table in the corner where he\u2019s gutting a rabbit. \u201cNice sword.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, it\u2019s served its purpose.\u201d He huffs and throws the weapon to the floor.\nGeralt freezes and turns to look at him slowly, his hands eerily covered in blood and rabbit guts. Disgusting. \u201cYou\u2019ve \u2013 used it?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yes. I\u2019ve bought it to use it.\u201d He crosses his arms over his chest and Geralt drops the knife he was holding onto the table.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve stabbed someone with it?\u201d Geralt, walking ever-so-slowly towards him, questions and Jaskier snort.\n\u201cOh, no, no, no! Dear Lioness of Cintra, no! I bought it to chase away the snooping neighbours.\u201d He pats Geralt\u2019s chest and frowns at the blood dripping onto the floor from the Witcher\u2019s hands.\n\u201cOh.\u201d Geralt\u2019s shoulders ease and Jaskier realizes, with startling suddenness, that Geralt had been worried that he\u2019d killed someone \u2013 or something, at least. And that\u2019s \u2013 well. It\u2019s oddly endearing that Geralt\u2019s concerned that he could be affected by his theoretical first kill. Which \u2013 Jaskier\u2019s stabbed a man before; it would hardly be the first time. Last year alone he took out one of the bandits that had attacked him before they stabbed him in the kidney and Triss came to chase them away.\n\u201cNow, if you\u2019re going to keep coming around, Geralt, I want to make a deal.\u201d He clears his throat, hopes that he doesn\u2019t look as messy as he feels in his sleep-rumpled shirt and breezy linen breeches.\n\u201cMh,\u201d Geralt sounds surprisingly agreeable so Jaskier continues.\n\u201cI want a gloves off approach, Geralt. If you\u2019re going to stick around I want you to tell me that you know and acknowledge the fact that I can take care of myself. No more unnecessary comments or derisive insults about my capabilities.\u201d He demands, wondering if it will be too much for the Witcher \u2013 if Geralt\u2019s sensitive ego can follow his needs.\nThe Witcher\u2019s eyebrows draw close together in contemplation and Jaskier sees his jaw working again before the oaf nods. \u201cAlright. I\u2019m sorry. No more \u2013 no more insults. I\u2019ll trust in your competence.\u201d\n\u201cGood. Now, then. I need to-\u201d\n\u201cAlready taken care of. There\u2019s a fresh bucketful next to the basin.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about-\u201d\n\u201cFed, watered \u2013 both the horse and the garden.\u201d\n\u201cWell.\u201d He huffs, both a little mad and impressed. Geralt was stealthier than Jaskier thought if the Witcher had managed to do all of his morning chores while he slept. \u201cWhat are you doing now?\u201d\n\u201cPreparing for lunch.\u201d Geralt shoots him another secretive smile and Jaskier blinks rapidly, wondering what sort of dream had he walked into. Though, he guesses that Geralt is too dressed \u2013 even without the leather \u2013 for it to be one of Jaskier\u2019s dreams.\n\u201cWell what am I supposed to do? You\u2019ve done my morning routine without me.\u201d He huffs, crossing his arms over his chest. He knows that Geralt meant well but Jaskier still can\u2019t help feeling a little babied by the actions. It was sweet \u2013 just not in a way that Jaskier needed it to be.\n\u00a0And surprise, surprise. Geralt\u2019s face falls a little, like he\u2019d realized what he\u2019d done and how Jaskier had perceived it. The Wither steps forward again, closing some of the distance between them and for a moment, Jaskier is afraid that the man will drop to his knees again.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean \u2013 it wasn\u2019t my intention to imply-\u201d The pigheaded man starts but Jaskier waves him off. He doesn\u2019t mind it as much as long as the Witcher knows what he\u2019d done wrong.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Just \u2013 wake me up next time, yeah?\u201d He yawns and turns back to his room. \u201cI\u2019m going back to bed; you know where to find me up if you need anything.\u201d\nHe crawls back under the covers and rests his head on the goose feather-filled pillow. What a strange morning. He has no doubt that these three days are just the beginning, though. And he knows, that if he can help it, then Geralt will continue grovelling for as long as Jaskier can hold out before he forgives the idiot fully.\nIn the afternoon, when the smell of cooked food wakes him up, he finds Geralt gone and Butters napping in front of the back door. He eyes the stew swinging in the kettle above the fire wearily and sniffs it. It doesn\u2019t not-smell like it usually does when Geralt cooks but rather, it has a pleasant aroma \u2013 like the man had used actual spices and vegetables in it. He sees that there are two bowls set out on the table with a fresh baked loaf of bread there as well. And? Geralt cooked and baked?\nWait till Yen hears about this. He thinks idly as he stirs the stew and tries a bit of it from the ladle. It\u2019s \u2013 well, it\u2019s delicious and there\u2019s no two ways about it. Geralt had cooked for them \u2013 for him. He\u2019d gone through the trouble of this simple indulgence for Jaskier\u2019s sake. His stomach warms at the thought and his cheeks heat.\n\u201cButters, where\u2019s the big brute? Go find him, boy!\u201d He claps his hands and Butters springs up onto all fours excitedly, tail wagging and his entire body with it as he comes to stand in front of Jaskier.\n\u201cGo get the Witcher!\u201d He jumps up in place and Butters imitates him, letting out a bark before running for the back door again. Jaskier hurries up after the dog and opens the door, watching as Butters becomes a blur of white heading across the grass out back towards the cliffside where a figure sits facing away from the house.\nHe watches as Geralt lets himself be toppled over by the yapping mutt and allows the dog to lick at his face. Butters seems to get the idea because in the next moment, the dog is biting at the sleeve of Geralt\u2019s dark shirt and tugging him in the direction of the house. Geralt gets the message easy enough and the two white wolves make their way back.\n\u201cThe stew\u2019s done.\u201d He says once he\u2019s certain that Geralt will hear him.\nThe Witcher nods, patting the dogs head and sending him towards Jaskier who readily stops the stupid thing from jumping up and muddying his white shirt. \u201cYou rabid cur, fuck off.\u201d He dodges the next attempt and the dog finally gives up after that.\n\u201cHe seems like a handful.\u201d Geralt comments conversationally and Jaskier snorts.\n\u201cI\u2019m used to dealing with difficult beings.\u201d He mutters, walking over to the hearth and picking up the kettle. He brings it to the table and motions for Geralt to sit at the available chair.\nIt\u2019s \u2013 a little uncomfortable. Jaskier doesn\u2019t remember it being uncomfortable before. Probably because he was always the one filling the silence with useless chatter but now they\u2019re both silent and \u2013 it\u2019s a little uncomfortable. He wishes he knew what to say. He can write a thousand sonnets about the simplest of things but he can\u2019t come up with a single verse for the man that he\u2019s in love with that\u2019s sitting across from him. And maybe it\u2019s because Jaskier still isn\u2019t sure where he stands on accepting Geralt\u2019s apology \u2013 and maybe it\u2019s because he\u2019s fairly certain that Geralt knows how he feels, but, either way \u2013 he remains silent.\n\u201cYou-\u201d Geralt clears his throat, pausing to chew the supple meat before continuing. \u201cYou mentioned Lettenhove.\u201d\nHe tilts his head, wondering what Geralt is aiming at here or if he is simply interested in Jaskier\u2019s origins. \u201cYes, Julian Alfred Pankratz of Lettenhove. Viscount to be exact. You \u2013 well, I guess you wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cHuh,\u201d Geralt blinks at him dumbly \u2013 in a sort of adorable way, like a dog.\nHe throws one of the smaller bones towards where Butters is and the beast catches it midair. \u201cNot everyone can afford the education I\u2019ve had. Seven liberal arts they called it at the Oxenfurt Academy.\u201d He doesn\u2019t like thinking about his education days \u2013 there was always something that made him wince when he remembered the long and boring lectures he\u2019d been forced to attend when he\u2019d rather have been out in the world gathering inspiration.\n\u201cMm,\u201d Geralt looks down at his stew bowl and Jaskier expects that he\u2019s done speaking on the subject, like usual but then the man speaks again. \u201cI \u2013 I\u2019m not really of Rivia.\u201d\n\u201cLies!\u201d His mouth pops open \u2013 \u201cCould it be? Geralt of Rivia \u2013 not actually of Rivia?\u201d\nGeralt\u2019s mouth tugs up in a smile and he nods. \u201cI grew up in Kaer Morhen. And we were encouraged to make up surnames. Vesemir chose mine.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, couldn\u2019t come up with one on your own?\u201d He grins, tilting forward, half of his food forgotten in order to give Geralt his full attention because Geralt sharing information about himself happens once every never.\n\u201cI \u2013 did. It just wasn\u2019t good.\u201d Geralt looks away.\n\u201cWhat was it?\u201d\n\u201cJaskier.\u201d\n\u201cCome on, you know my full name. It\u2019s only fair.\u201d He blinks at the Witcher innocently, doing his best impression of Butters when he wants a chunk of Jaskier\u2019s good dinner meat.\n\u201cGeralt Roger Eric du Haute-Bellegarde.\u201d The man grinds out and Jaskier doesn\u2019t stop the yell of pure glee that escapes him.\n\u201cWell thank the Great Sun for Vesemir, then!\u201d He cackles, his leg skipping with it and Geralt \u2013 well, he doesn\u2019t look like he much minds the sudden noise for once.\n\u201cYes, we were all lucky to have him.\u201d\nGeralt washes the bowls and takes the rest of the stew for himself on Jaskier\u2019s insistence \u2013 only because it would just go bad in the house otherwise, of course. And when he leaves, he looks back with an awkward wave that makes Jaskier\u2019s heart a little less icy.\n\u201cSo what you\u2019re telling me is that \u2013 he cooked a romantic lunch for you two and baked you this bread?\u201d Yennefer asks the next morning, stuffing her face with the remnants of said Geralt-made bread from yesterday.\n\u201cAre you alright? When\u2019s the last time you ate?\u201d He pushes the bit of cured meat in front of him to her side of the table and Yennefer takes it with a grin.\n\u201cMmh,\u201d She muffles her response with the meat and the cheese.\n\u201cAnd it wasn\u2019t a romantic lunch. It was just a regular meal.\u201d He huffs, pushing the cup of ale she\u2019d poured him earlier from hand to hand.\n\u201cIt\u2019s more than what I ever got.\u201d She scoffs, sending crumbs flying out of her mouth.\nHe grimaces and leans back to avoid any possibility of the mess reaching him. \u201cWell, then he must be serious about apologizing.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201d She states with a roll of her eyes, \u201cAnd I mean that in the most loving of ways, little songbird.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, that really comes across as fond.\u201d He pouts.\n\u201cAnd where\u2019s the man of the hour now?\u201d She looks around as if she\u2019s expecting to see the Witcher pop out from one of his cabinets and surprise them both.\n\u201cOh, um. Well. Yaruga needed his horseshoes replaced and I was going to do that today but then Geralt came by and he just \u2013 took the reins and asked if he could do it.\u201d He rubs at the back of his neck, feeling hot under her piercing stare.\n\u201cHe asked if he could do it?\u201d She says the words carefully and smacks her lips together like just saying them had left a bad taste in her mouth. \u201cAre you sure he didn\u2019t just grunt and take the horse without any comments?\u201d\n\u201cNo, he asked. I'm sure he asked. Unless I\u2019d hit my head getting out of bed this morning; he said: do you want me to take him to the blacksmith?\u201d He lowers his tone in the best imitation of Geralt he can do and Yennefer snorts loudly at him.\n\u201cNow I\u2019ve heard it all!\u201d She announces cheerily, purple eyes tearing up with mirth and \u2013 alright, maybe Jaskier is glad that he can entertain her so easily because hearing her laugh is rather nice.\n\u201cYes, well, he came here to grovel did he not? He must really want to apologize if he\u2019s being all polite and nice about it.\u201d He\u2019ll admit that it\u2019s a little suspicious but Geralt seems to be genuinely trying to make up for what he did and Jaskier is well aware that the other could flip on him in a moment\u2019s notice but he\u2019ll trust the Witcher this once and think of his intentions as pure and goodness-fuelled. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cJaskier, my sweet boy.\u201d She croons \u2013 only a little condescending. \u201cIn all my years of knowing Geralt I\u2019ve never known him to ask for permission before doing anything so mundane.\u201d\n\u201cI don't think I like what you\u2019re trying to imply here.\u201d He looks away from her gaze again \u2013 she\u2019s always intimidating when she\u2019s looking at him like that.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to imply if it\u2019s all true.\u201d She taps the tip of her nose in an odd fashion and then turns to the door briefly before bursting out into laughter that\u2019s entirely too eccentric.\nFor a moment he\u2019s worried that she\u2019s lost her mind but then the door opens and Geralt walks in, pausing at the sight of the two of them.\n\u201cOh, Jaskier! You always know how to make a lady feel special!\u201d She squeals in fake delight and Jaskier thinks he\u2019s losing his mind. But then he notices how Geralt\u2019s shoulders tense and how his cat eyes narrow at her with something disgruntled in his gaze and oh \u2013 is she trying to make Geralt jealous? Of her? In Jaskier\u2019s stead??\n\u201cOh, hi, Geralt. What brings you here?\u201d She eases back into her sultry tone and Jaskier is worried he\u2019s bleeding internally in his head because this is all entirely too odd.\n\u201cBrought Yaruga back.\u201d The Witcher eyes the bread on the table and how Yennefer had hoarded what was left of it with disdain clear on his face.\n\u201cI hope he behaved. He\u2019s got a bit of a temperament.\u201d Jaskier stands up, fiddling with his sleeves as he walks over to the window to check if the horse is grazing at the small pasture.\n\u201cHe was good.\u201d Geralt confirms with a light hum.\n\u201cThat\u2019s excellent. How much do I owe you, for the horseshoes?\u201d He tugs the coin purse out of one of the chests under the window and turns to the Witcher.\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2013 my treat. You don't have to worry about it.\u201d Geralt stares him down as he gapes.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous, you know that I can more than afford it and-\u201d\n\u201cI know. I know. It\u2019s \u2013 a gift. For Yaruga. For... Keeping you safe on your travels.\u201d Geralt clears his throat and pointedly avoids looking in Yennefer\u2019s direction as she doubles over in silent laughter.\n\u201cOh, well.\u201d He\u2019s rendered speechless again. This is getting old, he thinks briefly.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a couple of Drowners in the town over. I will probably be away until tomorrow.\u201d Geralt moves back out of the house and Jaskier follows to send him on his way like he\u2019s the lonely noblewoman again \u2013 sans the wine this time.\n\u201cRemember to wake me up.\u201d He calls and Geralt nods with a smile before trotting over to where Roach is waiting for him. He waves at the horse and she whinnies at him.\nHe closes the door and turns back to Yen, leaning against the wood and utterly bewildered. She\u2019s still smiling widely and he knows that what she says next is going to change something.\n\u201cAre you certain you don\u2019t know what his intentions are?\u201d She bites at her lower lip to stop herself from talking and Jaskier closes his eyes.\n\u201cDon\u2019t even start.\u201d\nTwo weeks of Geralt waking him up every morning and doing his chores with him and then either one of them cooking food and he\u2019s still not used to it fully.\nIt\u2019s odd, it\u2019s new and it\u2019s good. Jaskier feels like he\u2019d somehow domesticated the wild man and even though Geralt still sometimes goes to the neighbouring villages for an odd job here or there \u2013 he doesn\u2019t mind, not really. Geralt is, after all, above everything else, a Witcher and it\u2019s his duty. Which brings Jaskier to the dilemma of keeping Geralt from said duties. He feels \u2013 selfish. He\u2019s keeping the Witcher here at the coast where the two of them can pretend like nothing bad goes on out in the world and where they can enjoy doing chores in silence together.\nHe still talks some but he\u2019s timid to do so more often than not. Which in turn, makes Geralt talk more. So Jaskier hears about his adventures more than he had before and in great detail, too. And in the evening, when Geralt leaves to sleep wherever he\u2019s set up camp, Jaskier sits down at the kitchen table and writes more songs than he has in the last two years. Not all of them are for the public, of course. Some of them are too tender \u2013 too revealing to ever let anyone see them let alone hear the sorrowful tunes he sings them to.\nGeralt is, of course, endlessly amused by Butters howling every time he picks up his lute and is adamantly sticking to his theory that Butters is trying to steal his job. It\u2019s sweet. Geralt doesn\u2019t look at him with disdain anymore, he doesn\u2019t presume Jaskier wants things done for him and he tries his best not to stop Jaskier from doing reckless things like jumping off the cliff into the sea that one time.\n\u201cWhat is he doing?\u201d A familiar voice behind him calls and he startles, turning to look at Triss and Yennefer that have just emerged from the fading portal there.\n\u201cI told you, it\u2019s eerie.\u201d Yennefer grins at Jaskier in turn.\n\u201cM\u2019ladies,\u201d He curtsies before he turns back to watching Geralt chopping down trees in the nearby woods. They walk over to stand next to him at the edge of his land and silently watch the man work with the large axe for a couple of moments more.\n\u201cIs this some weird Witcher courting ritual?\u201d Triss turns to him and Yennefer and Jaskier splutters.\n\u201cNo!\u201d He yelps at the same time as Yennefer says it appears to be.\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t he have just \u2013 you know, given him a pedant or something? Like the rest of us do it?\u201d Triss huffs and places one hand on her hip and \u2013 now wait just a second. \n\u201cHoly Mother of Asclepius!\u201d He gapes dramatically, pointing to the two of them and then down at their joined hands. \u201cYou! And her!\u201d\n\u201cYen, I thought you told him?\u201d Triss pouts at the shorter sorceress who looks a bit uncomfortable at Jaskier connecting the dots.\n\u201cErr, surprise?\u201d Yen shrugs one shoulder uncertainly and Jaskier claps his hands together. \u201cI told him I was betrothed \u2013 just not to whom.\u201d\n\u201cNow I really have to write you two a song in congratulations!\u201d He twirls on his heels, ready to go up to the house and fetch his lute but Triss\u2019 hand on his arm stops him.\n\u201cOh, no. This isn\u2019t about us. This is about this weird thing that Geralt is doing.\u201d She demands, a stern look on her face that just makes Yennefer\u2019s smile soften more.\n\u201cI don't think it\u2019s weird.\u201d He huffs, crossing his arms over his chest. He\u2019s fairly certain that Geralt can hear them so he doesn\u2019t want to say anything too incriminating. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten colder during the night and I don't have a steady supply of kindling so he\u2019s making a stock.\u201d\n\u201cHe does know you\u2019re not going to stay here forever, right?\u201d Triss tilts her head in question and Jaskier goes a little numb at her words.\nBecause she\u2019s right. It doesn\u2019t matter how much Jaskier loves his little house and his garden, he\u2019s not going to stay for much longer. The moment he releases Geralt from his grovelling obligations and the Witcher hits the road again, Jaskier will find another city to wallow in before moving to the next \u2013 rinse and repeat.\n\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right. Once he leaves I don\u2019t see why I\u2019d stay here for much longer. I\u2019ve had my time at the coast, maybe I head for the mountains next.\u201d He sighs and crouches down the give Butters a belly rub.\n\u201cIs he an idiot?\u201d He hears Triss ask Yennefer who snorts.\n\u201cIn all honesty, I'm not sure.\u201d The other witch responds and both of them let out a long-suffering sigh.\n\u201cLet me ask you this,\u201d Triss starts \u2013 she seems slightly better at making polite conversation out of sensitive topics than Yennefer who would just barrel through what needs to be said and then wince afterwards.\n\u201cHave you forgiven him yet? Has he learned?\u201d Triss asks and Jaskier thinks it over.\n\u201cI \u2013 yes, I have.\u201d He admits and it hurts a little because now he\u2019ll have to tell Geralt as well. \u201cHe has.\u201d \u00a0\n\u201cThen have that conversation with him, Jaskier. Air out whatever\u2019s been in your linens chest and see what happens.\u201d Triss places a gentle hand on his shoulder and he looks up into her kind eyes. \u201cI can promise you that it will be okay.\u201d\nHe shivers, regretting not owning a thicker coat because the wind blowing in from the sea really is frigid. He \u2013 well. If anyone knows things are going to turn out alright, he supposes it would be the two powerful sorceresses that he\u2019d somehow befriended.\nThat evening, once they\u2019ve had their food and the two lasses have had their fair share of making fun of Geralt, Jaskier washes the bowls and the cups in the basin and listens to the sounds of Geralt sharpening his swords.\nHe clears his throat, \u201cIt\u2019s really gotten cold out, there\u2019s frost on the windows.\u201d Not like he feels the weather inside with the fire burning steadily in the hearth.\n\u201cHm.\u201d Geralt confirms, \u201cColder still by the water.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d He doesn\u2019t know how he\u2019s going to pose this but he knows what he wants to ask. He\u2019s a little nervous and he\u2019s sure that Geralt can hear his heart beating rapidly. \u201cI never did ask you \u2013 where have you been sleeping?\u201d\n\u201cUh,\u201d Geralt\u2019s movements halt like he hadn\u2019t expected it. \u201cI\u2019ve set up camp nearby, in the forest.\u201d\n\u201cFor two weeks?\u201d He asks incredulously. He\u2019d expected Geralt to be staying in an inn or something in the nearest town but apparently the man had been sleeping in the forest under the stars. Poor Roach.\n\u201cI\u2019ve had worse and for longer. At least there are no monsters lurking around.\u201d Geralt says easily and then Jaskier hears his sword being sheathed.\nHe grips the rag in his hands and tries not to fumble as he dries the bowl he\u2019s holding off. \u201cWhat \u2013 what would you say if I asked you to stay here tonight?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s not that cold, Jaskier, you don't have to.\u201d Geralt speaks quietly like he\u2019s afraid that speaking any louder will upset him.\n\u201cI know you can handle a little bad weather, you brute, but I-\u201d He turns back around, determined now. \u201cI want you to stay here tonight. You can put Roach in the pen next to Yaruga and you can indulge in the warmth of a roof over your head for once.\u201d\n\u201cHow come you ask me now?\u201d Geralt doesn\u2019t sound accusing, merely interested in the answer.\nJaskier hopes that his cheeks aren\u2019t as red as they feel. He can\u2019t exactly admit to the Witcher that he\u2019d been thinking about sharing a bed with him since he\u2019d come up with this silly little plan this morn.\n\u201cBecause \u2013 well, because I'm ready to talk. I think.\u201d He nods his head towards the door. \u201cDo you need help clearing out the pen?\u201d\n\u201cNo \u2013 I \u2013 I think I got it, thank you.\u201d Geralt stares at him for a moment before nodding to himself and leaving.\nJaskier releases the breath he didn\u2019t know he was holding in and slumps against the nearest chair. Well \u2013 that went well. He takes a deep breath and catches a whiff of Yennefer\u2019s perfume lingering the air like she\u2019d marked her territory. He snorts at the image of Yennefer rubbing up against his furniture like a cat claiming what\u2019s hers.\nHe takes up his lute and starts strumming one of the tunes that doesn\u2019t make Butters want to start howling. He plays the song with his eyes closed and gets lose in the tune. It\u2019s one of his newer ones \u2013 he\u2019d written it with sprawling roads travelled alone in mind but he\u2019ll probably repurpose it to something less dramatic that people actually want to hear.\nHe strums the last cord and opens his eyes to find Geralt standing in the corner of the room with a gentle smile on his face.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t heard that one before.\u201d The Witcher admits with a hum and Jaskier fumbles with the lute uselessly.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t performed it before. It\u2019s new \u2013 not finished really. I\u2019ll probably put some more pep in it before I decide to sing it for the public. It\u2019s too \u2013 melancholic like this, too nostalgic. People don't like hearing nostalgia in a song, did you know? A dramatic tale of broken hearts and dead people, yes, but yearning and wandering? Booed right off the stage if there is one!\u201d He prattles uselessly as he stows the lute away and tries to put himself out of Geralt\u2019s direct line of sight.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t always have to be performing, Jaskier. You\u2019re allowed to keep some songs for yourself.\u201d Comes Geralt\u2019s reply that gives him pause. He turns around to face the Witcher.\n\u201cBut I'm a bard, what good am I if I'm not performing? I tried being a professor and that went horribly. Pleasing the crowds is what I do.\u201d He huffs with a floppy hand gesture that\u2019s supposed to mean \u2018obviously\u2019.\n\u201cI'm not saying it isn\u2019t.\u201d Geralt shrugs his wide shoulders. \u201cI'm simply pointing out that they shouldn\u2019t be privy to your every ballad, every emotion, all the time. You can play just for the sake of doing something that you love.\u201d\n\u201cOh, huh.\u201d He prides himself on his ability to string sentences together but right now, after Geralt\u2019s kind words, he can't string together a coherent thought much less a sentence fit for being spoken out loud. \u201cI suppose you\u2019re right.\u201d\n\u201cIt was bound to happen at some point.\u201d Geralt smirks and then goes for the bedroom and now Jaskier is faced with the fact that they\u2019re going to be sharing a bed for the first time in about two years.\nThey\u2019d shared before out of necessity, of course, but it hadn\u2019t been this tense before. Jaskier hadn\u2019t been this tense before. Because he knew that Geralt would simply, push him out of bed if he got too clingy during the night and that would be it. But he doesn\u2019t know how this new and reformed Geralt would feel to waking up with Jaskier clinging to his back.\nThough, on the topic of that, he doesn\u2019t really think that Geralt\u2019s been reformed. He thinks that their time apart gave Geralt ample opportunity to rethink his choices and to decide how he wanted to move forward. And Geralt had decided that being more considerate to a friend and apologizing was the proper thing to do.\nIt\u2019s flattery at its finest and no words Jaskier will ever produce will ever even come close.\nSighing to himself, he enters the other room and closes the door behind him. Sorry Butters, he thinks to himself, your side of the bed\u2019s occupied tonight.\n\u201cYou wanted to talk?\u201d Geralt ventures as he drops his things onto one of the chests in the corner and puts the swords under his side of the bed because it\u2019s a force of habit.\n\u201cYes.\u201d He feels his chest constricting a little and his knees going weak so he walks over to sit on the bed.\n\u201cI know I always have much to say but it\u2019s not always important. This time, I want to say that \u2013 I forgive you. You\u2019ve more than made up for what you said and just \u2013 your grovelling days are over, Geralt.\u201d He looks up at the man who\u2019d come to stand in front of him. \u201cThank you for \u2013 for listening, I suppose. And for reconsidering and coming to find me. For looking out for me even though I didn\u2019t need it, too.\u201d He clears his throat because it\u2019d gotten a little tight. \u201cSo \u2013 you don\u2019t have to stick around. It\u2019s going to be winter soon and the world out there needs you. It\u2019s time to return to your Witcher-ly duties.\u201d\nGeralt drops to his knees in front of him before Jaskier\u2019s even done talking, yellow eyes dancing in the candlelight.\n\u201cJaskier.\u201d The growl in his voice doesn\u2019t sound as menacing as it used to. \u201cI haven\u2019t been grovelling just for your forgiveness. Yes, I came here with the intentions to apologize but I \u2013 I didn\u2019t stay here just to make it up to you. I stayed because I missed you. I missed your company. And if grovelling would let me be your friend again, then I did what had to be done. And I\u2019ve come to enjoy it. Sure you had me running chores but I liked doing things for you. They were mundane \u2013 normal.\u201d\nGeralt speaks in a way that has Jaskier\u2019s heart hammering out of his chest and his ears clogged with blood flowing through his veins. The White Wolf sounds so sincere and so fond all at once that Jaskier doesn\u2019t know what to do.\n\u201cBut if you want me to, I\u2019ll go. I know I'm not the easiest person to be around.\u201d Geralt chuckles lowly and Jaskier feels his lungs stutter.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cAnd if I asked you to stay?\u201d He whispers out tentatively, an arm coming up \u2013 shaking all the way towards its destination that just happens to be Geralt\u2019s lightly stubbled cheek.\nGeralt leans into the touch and closes his eyes. \u201cThen I\u2019d stay. For as long as you\u2019d have me.\u201d\nA sob catches in Jaskier\u2019s chest and he refuses to let it leave. Surely Geralt doesn\u2019t mean it like that. Surely Geralt isn\u2019t implying all those things Yennefer had hinted at?\n\u201cGeralt.\u201d\n\u201cIt was awful.\u201d The Witcher breathes out, nostrils flaring. \u201cIt was awful travelling without you. More than I could have imagined it would be. I thought \u2013 we\u2019ve parted way before and that this time it would be no different but \u2013 it was somehow so much worse.\u201d Geralt\u2019s hands with their large palms and their calluses come to rest onto his knees and Jaskier shudders at the warmth they radiate.\n\u201cI hated the silence. I hated that it was my fault. I hated that it wasn\u2019t Destiny because if it were then I could just say it wasn\u2019t meant to be. But no \u2013 it was me; I\u2019d done that to myself and to you.\u201d Geralt grunts like he\u2019s angry at the whole world and Jaskier just \u2013 just wants to kiss him, really. \u201cI hated walking into a tavern and hearing your songs being sung by someone else and hearing word about how well you were doing and knowing that you never needed me in the first place.\u201d Geralt swallows and grimaces and Jaskier watches the emotions play out across his face. \u201cBut that I needed you, instead. I still do. And if you ask me to stay, I will. But \u2013 not as a friend. As something more if you'd allow it.\u201d\nMortified, he feels a tear slip the corner of his eye and he feels his entire world unravelling in front of him. The words being spoken wash over him like a spell, sending his heart out of his chest and setting his entire being aflame. He opens his mouth to respond but the only thing that comes out is a shaky laugh, rough and wet-sounding.\n\u201cI\u2019d never ask you to stay, you silly man. Not because I don't want you here because the Gods know that I do. But because you\u2019re a Witcher. You are on your best out there doing what you know how to do and enjoy doing despite the complaints.\u201d He rubs a thumb under the Witcher\u2019s eye, marvelling the fact that he can do that now. \u201cNo. Instead, I\u2019d accompany you back on the road. Like old times.\u201d\n\u201cNot like old times,\u201d Geralt hisses. \u201cNever like that again. Better, instead.\u201d The Witcher shuffles closer until he\u2019s kneeling between Jaskier\u2019s spread knees and he almost gets vertigo looking into the man\u2019s eyes.\n\u201cYou\u2019d really let me come?\u201d He brings his other hand up as well, mirroring the position of the one already on Geralt\u2019s face.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t leave here without you.\u201d Geralt\u2019s words are firm and certain.\n\u201cWhat of the house?\u201d He asks feebly as Geralt starts slowly leaning in.\n\u201cLet Triss and Yen take care of it for the winter, they\u2019re on the run anyway.\u201d Geralt rushes out in the last few scant inches between their faces and then they\u2019re kissing.\nIt\u2019s a lot softer than Jaskier had imagined, there\u2019s too many emotions swirling around both their hearts for it to be fast and rough like he thought it would. He used to think that Geralt would kiss him in a fit of annoyance just to shut him up but that never happened. It stands to show just how surprising Geralt still is to him and how much more he has to learn about the Witcher.\nThey break apart, both breathing heavily and keeping as close as humanly possible.\n\u201cYou know, when I asked you to stay the night, my intentions were rather pure.\u201d He bites at his lip, feeling out how swollen it\u2019s getting, and Geralt zeroes in on the move.\n\u201cHm,\u201d The Witcher grunts, dislodging one of his hands to cup Jaskier\u2019s face in turn, pushing his thumb onto his bottom lip. \u201cI hope you don't mind the change of plans then.\u201d Geralt smirks dangerously and Jaskier\u2019s stomach tightens in excitement.\n\u201cNot at all, my sweet idiot, not at all.\u201d He lets Geralt\u2019s thumb slip into his mouth and bites at it teasingly, loving the rapt way with which the Witcher observes his lips.\n\u201cJaskier.\u201d It\u2019s half filled with warning and half filled with lust and it makes the heat in his stomach fester and slide lower until he\u2019s feeling all of the effects of just how gorgeous the Witcher is. \u201cDon\u2019t start something you don\u2019t intend to finish.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I\u2019ll give you a finish, alright.\u201d He promises with a cheeky wink, feeling both elated and like he weighs too much under Geralt\u2019s gaze.\nWith another growl Geralt springs up, picking Jaskier up by the waist easily and then \u2013 then he\u2019s on his back on the bed with Geralt between his legs, looking down at him like he\u2019s something to be treasured.\n\u201cYou better not let me down, Geralt; with the amount of time I\u2019ve spent thinking about this \u2013 you have a lot to live up to.\u201d He grins as Geralt\u2019s soft expression turns into a scowl.\n\u201cYou insufferable,\u201d Geralt crowds down against him, nose pressing insistently into the skin of his throat. \u201cVexatious, irritating, incredible, remarkable, wondrous little Blue Jay.\u201d\nHe whines, tilting his head backwards so that Geralt has more room and skin to explore. \u201cWhy \u2013 ah, fuck \u2013 why a Blue Jay.\u201d\nGeralt, too busy leaving little bites against his throat and marking him up prettily, takes a bit to respond. \u201cYour eyes, your voice, your flighty nature. Always so free and unrestrained. You\u2019re asking for words when I\u2019d rather keep my mouth occupied somewhere else.\u201d Geralt\u2019s voice vibrates along his skin and he can feel the Witcher\u2019s chest rumbling against his own.\n\u201cToo many clothes, love, off.\u201d He demands, remembering that he should definitely be more naked if they were going to do anything.\nHe shudders as Geralt\u2019s hands slip under his blue shirt and start tugging it upwards \u2013 no time for buttons. And yet, the brute is careful with his belonging so nothing actually gets torn in the end. His chest is exposed to the tepid room air and Geralt follows by taking off his own shirt with a lot less care.\n\u201cYou \u2013 you\u2019re ridiculous.\u201d He lifts his eyes towards the sky before surging forward and letting his arms roam all over the other\u2019s fit chest. He traces every groove, every dip and every scar with his fingers, taking his time and enjoying how Geralt strains under the gentle touch.\n\u201cYou just as much,\u201d Geralt grinds out, his hands gentle on Jaskier\u2019s sides as he lets him explore slowly.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always looked but to be able to touch, oh, Geralt.\u201d He whines and tips forward, at this point nuzzling under the Witcher\u2019s chin like a swooning maiden, hands spread over the man\u2019s ribs. \u201cLook at you, you\u2019re gorgeous. So strong and so good. Letting me drink my fill, aren\u2019t you? Know exactly what I want.\u201d He just \u2013 he can't stop everything he\u2019s ever thought about from spilling out like a dam breaking.\n\u201cJaskier,\u201d Geralt groans as he grips the man\u2019s ass like he\u2019d always wanted to.\nHe can feel the other wavering where he\u2019s kneeling over Jaskier\u2019s thighs, swaying and breathing hard. It\u2019s exhilarating, having Geralt all to himself like this, at his mercy and waiting for his cues.\n\u201cWhat is it, Wolf? You\u2019ve got something to say?\u201d He grins teasingly, kneading at the muscles of Geralt\u2019s back. \u201cOr are you going to bite wordlessly.\u201d\n\u201cSave your pretty words for your pretty dames, bard.\u201d Geralt grunts, cheeks flushed and still holding himself up and letting Jaskier do what he wishes.\n\u201cBut there are no prettier dames than the sight before me, for the mighty Witcher, bare-chested and blushing, makes for the prettiest sight of them all.\u201d He purrs melodically, practically singing the words to the other.\n\u201cOil, Jaskier.\u201d Geralt, patience apparently running thin, demands.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re willing to walk, there\u2019s some in the second chest over there.\u201d He waves in the general direction of his belongings and Geralt grunts. He briefly mourns the loss of warmth but watching Geralt ridding himself of his pants and undergarments is worth the loss. He groans as his own need twitches in his breeches. He decides that getting nude is the best course of action. He shucks his breeches and tosses them to the side.\nHe\u2019s always been fairly confident in his own body \u2013 he\u2019s decently tall, fairly built all things considering and of a good size but Geralt is all that and so much more and Jaskier\u2019s mouth waters as the Witcher turns around and he gets an eyeful of exactly what the other is sporting now that he\u2019s fully hard.\n\u201cGods, Geralt, come here.\u201d He scrambles on his knees to the edge of the bed as Geralt approaches. He grips the man\u2019s hips, digging his fingers into the V there hurriedly. He\u2019s fairly certain that he looks like a man starved as he spreads his knees so that he\u2019s at the perfect level to take Geralt\u2019s cock in his mouth.\n\u201cJaskier-\u201d\n\u201cShut up, Witcher.\u201d He grunts and takes the other\u2019s member in hand, giving him a hearty stroke before lowering his mouth and licking a stripe up the considerable length. \u201cShut up and let me suck your big fucking cock, Geralt, Gods.\u201d\nGeralt\u2019s chuckle gets cut off mid leaving his mouth because Jaskier finally gets his lips around the glistening cockhead. \u201cJaskier.\u201d\nIt pleases him to know that he\u2019s rendered the Witcher to only being able to say his name and to grunts of pleasure.\nHe takes his time with this too, licking and sucking and finessing. He wants to make the other remember, wants to make it so that this is the only thing that Geralt will be able to think about every time he looks at Jaskier\u2019s face. He looks up, blinking away the tears and meeting Geralt\u2019s awed gaze. He pulls off slowly, prolonging the contact and enjoying the taste.\n\u201cNow, I don't do this often, Geralt, it\u2019s bad for my throat. But I\u2019ll make an exception for you, darling.\u201d He grins, loving the way his lips are already a little sore.\n\u201cWhat are - fuck!\u201d Geralt\u2019s hands shoot to his hair, gripping the brunette strands and Jaskier almost wants to chuckle.\nHe would, too, if there wasn\u2019t a cock lodged in his throat at the moment. He tenses his throat to make more room for Geralt\u2019s size in there. It\u2019s not particularly pleasant but he knows that the men he\u2019s done this for \u2013 which were far and few in between \u2013 have always enjoyed it. And nothing got him more aroused than knowing he\u2019s bringing pleasure to his lovers. He pulls out all the stops and starts humming low in his throat and Geralt starts cursing in a tongue he doesn\u2019t recognize.\n\u201cIs that \u2013 Jaskier, is that fucking Toss a Coin to Your Witcher you little-\u201d Geralt throws his head back and moans, loud and beautiful and no matter how much Jaskier wishes to bring the other off like this, he wants Geralt in him more.\n\u201cLittle what? Bard? Songbird? Blue Jay?\u201d He grins and shuffles back on his knees, dragging Geralt by the hips and getting him on the bed.\n\u201cTempest,\u201d Geralt grunts, picking up the oil where he\u2019d dropped it on the bed. \u201cLike a fucking storm, Jaskier, came into my life and roused everything I\u2019ve ever kept buried.\u201d\n\u201cIt was an honour, my beastly Witcher.\u201d He purrs and lies back down, spreading his legs wide open and giving himself a stroke to the visage that is Geralt at the moment \u2013 with his dishevelled white hair and wild eyes.\n\u201cYou would enjoy causing chaos, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d Geralt smiles then, settling down some and reclaiming his place between Jaskier\u2019s thighs.\n\u201cWhat good is life without a little chaos in it?\u201d He grins, arching his back and tempting the Witcher with his body alone.\n\u201cQuiet.\u201d Geralt responds, bending low and dragging his lips across Jaskier\u2019s chest down to his stomach.\n\u201cI thought we \u2013 ah, fuck \u2013 established that you hated the silence.\u201d He whines and wiggles in place as Geralt\u2019s hands hold him still by the hips. The Witcher\u2019s nose digs under his bellybutton and Jaskier can hear him inhale deeply. \u201cYou \u2013 don't be disgusting.\u201d\n\u201cYou smell nice, clean, and like lavender.\u201d Geralt rumbles and Jaskier smiles fondly, running his hand through the other\u2019s white strands.\n\u201cThank you, I take baths sometimes.\u201d He chuckles and Geralt huffs in amusement. \u201cNow, do you want to fuck me or are you going to continue sniffing me like a dog?\u201d\n\u201cJaskier.\u201d Geralt lays his head down onto his belly and looks up at him with adoration in his eyes. \u201cLet me enjoy the moment, yeah?\u201d\n\u201cYou giant sap.\u201d He coos at the Witcher and they lie like that for a moment, just soaking each other\u2019s presence in.\n\u201cOnly for you,\u201d Geralt confirms and Jaskier\u2019s arousal twitches valiantly against Geralt\u2019s chest, right between his large pectorals. And oh, that\u2019s definitely something he wants to explore in the future by straddling the other\u2019s chest and-\n\u201cYou having fun in there?\u201d Geralt reaches up and taps his forehead and flicks the tip of his nose.\nHe blushes at being caught thinking about the other inappropriately \u2013 which is ridiculous because he\u2019s just had Geralt\u2019s hardness in his mouth and he can still taste him even.\n\u201cThat is a fantasy for another day.\u201d He admits with a cheeky giggle and Geralt rolls his eyes.\nThe Witcher levers himself up with his mighty arms and Jaskier gives into the urge to grip one of them with his fingers. Geralt huffs in amusement before he kneels back up, popping open the bottle of oil.\n\u201cOh, yes.\u201d He keens and pulls the pillow out from the headboard to push it under his lower back. \u201cRemember, Geralt, no holding back.\u201d\n\u201cMm,\u201d Geralt hums, running one of his palms over Jaskier\u2019s thigh and eyeing the inside of it briefly before dipping down and biting at the pale skin there. He curses, throwing his head back as the Witcher\u2019s teeth worry at him, making sure that a bruise will form there.\n\u201cYou marking me up, Witcher?\u201d He gripes as Geralt drizzles some of the oil into his hand.\n\u201cHave to make sure people know that you\u2019re taken.\u201d Geralt sneers like the thought of someone putting their hands on Jaskier is making him physically ill.\n\u201cOh? I'm not sure I like this base possessiveness that\u2019s being shown.\u201d He hums, teasing of course because it\u2019s still flattering, but it gives Geralt pause.\n\u201cI'm sorry.\u201d Geralt lowers his head like a scolded dog and Jaskier snorts.\n\u201cYou \u2013 you\u2019re ridiculous. Like I\u2019d ever want anyone other than you, Geralt. I'm just teasing, of course I'm going to let the people know. It\u2019s going to be the first song I\u2019ll sing, my great comeback after a prolonged absence. About the great Witcher and his massive \u2013 fuck.\u201d He closes his eyes as Geralt\u2019s finger breaches the ring of muscle. \u201cYes, Gods.\u201d He whines at the slight sting but relaxes as Geralt takes to dragging his cheek along his knee.\n\u201cTell me if it hurts.\u201d Geralt demands and then he feels the other adding more oil.\nHe closes his eyes and enjoys the sensation, enjoys the feeling of skin on skin \u2013 of Geralt\u2019s strong hands and his stubble against him, of the fingers in him. He gets lost in it, the dizzying rush of lust and yearning and arousal that swirls low in his belly. He moans as Geralt twists his fingers and brushes up against that one special place. He twitches his hips and tries to bear down onto the fingers inside him but Geralt holds him still. He whines, not having the capacity for words, half mad with pleasure already.\n\u201cPlease, Geralt, I can take it, I promise.\u201d He hooks his legs around the other\u2019s waist, trying to tug him closer. \u201cCome on, please.\u201d\n\u201cSing so prettily, little bird.\u201d Geralt\u2019s grin is positively feral and Jaskier feels terrifyingly exposed and madly aroused all at once. He watches as Geralt uses some of the oil on his own length and Jaskier feels giddy as the Witcher lines himself up.\nIt\u2019s almost too much \u2013 the man\u2019s cock\u2019s certainly bigger than most he\u2019s had \u2013 but Geralt goes slow, gentle despite his rough hands gripping Jaskier\u2019s hips.\n\u201cFuck, Geralt.\u201d He breathes out and the Witcher kisses him, distracting him from the stretch. He whines and accepts it as Geralt\u2019s tongue seeks entrance into his mouth. This time the kiss is rough like he\u2019d expected it to be. And he revels in it \u2013 in the heady grunts that Geralt releases into his mouth and the slow twitches of the man\u2019s hips.\n\u201cYou can \u2013 fuck, move, Geralt.\u201d He whines as Geralt\u2019s cock twitches inside him.\n\u201cAs you wish,\u201d Geralt grins against his cheek and then his hips start moving.\nJaskier\u2019s had some good fucks in his life but very few even come close to what Geralt is able to do. The power behind the thrusts sends Jaskier up the bed and the Witcher has to hold either hold him or pull him back down onto his length with every other thrust. Jaskier knows he\u2019s babbling \u2013 he doesn\u2019t know what exactly but his mouth is open and he\u2019s letting out noises. Geralt is relentless, his hips slapping against Jaskier\u2019s ass like he\u2019s trying to punish him. And he loves it, he loves that Geralt isn\u2019t careful with him like he was afraid he\u2019d be.\n\u201cThat\u2019s it, sing for me, little songbird.\u201d Geralt growls against his shoulder, teeth bared against his skin.\n\u201cGeralt!\u201d He wails as the Witcher takes hold of his thighs and throws them over his shoulders. The Witcher is almost bending him in half at this point, rigorously slamming into him and making him dizzy with everything.\n\u201cCome on, Jaskier.\u201d Geralt grunts, tugging one of Jaskier\u2019s hands free of the sheets and bringing it to his own cock. He gets the message only because he\u2019s so close to climax already and he grips his own length almost savagely. He times his tugs with Geralt\u2019s thrusts and only a handful of movements later, he\u2019s spilling onto his own stomach with a loud whine.\nHe protests feebly, too tired to form actual words, as Geralt pulls out and lowers his legs to the bed. The Witcher strokes himself off with his nose buried under the crook of Jaskier\u2019s jaw, panting harshly and rapidly. The Witcher adds to the mess on his belly with a choked off grunts and Jaskier closes his eyes when a shiver wracks his body. If he were any younger he\u2019d be ready to go again by now.\nBut, he is not, and Geralt is very heavy so he nudges the man to the side. \u201cGods, you weigh as much as a horse. I need air, you big oaf.\u201d\nGeralt grumbles but lifts off anyway, he looks around and then fishes Jaskier\u2019s soft breeches off the ground, using the cloth to clean the mess on his stomach.\n\u201cI\u2019d call you sweet but those are mine and I'm going to have to wash that out.\u201d He sighs, closing his eyes and avoiding Geralt\u2019s shit-eating grin. He\u2019s \u2013 he\u2019s feeling a little overwhelmed.\n\u201cAre you \u2013 are you okay?\u201d Geralt tosses the breeches to the floor and settles next to Jaskier, plastering himself to his side.\n\u201cI'm more than okay, a little too good, I think. It\u2019s hard to believe.\u201d He chuckles and turns to the side, facing Geralt and placing a hand onto his cheek because he can.\n\u201cI'm sorry \u2013 for making it seem like it\u2019s something so far out of your reach. You deserve more, better.\u201d Geralt grumbles and Jaskier rolls his eyes.\n\u201cYes but, luckily, I don't want anything other than you. So you\u2019re stuck with me.\u201d He smacks a loud kiss onto the other\u2019s forehead and Geralt grimaces.\n\u201cI\u2019ll gladly be stuck with you for all the lifetimes and then all of them over twice again.\u201d Geralt pulls him into his chest and nuzzles his hair. \u201cI love you, my little Blue Jay.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean it? This lifetime and the next?\u201d He asks, suddenly very aware of how the odds are stacked against them in this one.\n\u201cYes, I do.\u201d Geralt says firmly and it calms Jaskier a little, allows him to relax.\n\u201cThen I love you, too, my White Wolf.\u201d He kisses the hollow of Geralt\u2019s throat and allows himself to hope that everything will be okay now that they\u2019re back together properly.\nHe allows himself to be happy because he deserves it."
