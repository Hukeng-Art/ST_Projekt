Lame, anyways onto the thank yous.</p>\n<p>Honestly I really thought I\u2019d make this fic three chapters and it would have been probably 15k words MAXIMUM because I really only write one shots, but this has been awesome to write and I hope you all have enjoyed it!

Again, thank you for all the love on this fic, I seriously really appreciate it &lt;3</p>\n<p>edit: the series of oneshots i mentioned is in reference to the \u2018heir peter\u2019 universe created from this initial work and is in a series that is linked below this end note. there\u2019s about 20 works of bamf peter that i wrote last year, don\u2019t take the timeline too seriously and enjoy &lt;3</p>",
    "text": "Peter Parker was the heir to Stark Industries. The papers had been drawn up. Tony had signed, as the official owner of SI. Pepper had signed, the exhausted CEO, happy to hand over the legacy. Aunt May had signed, the guardian. The only one who hadn\u2019t signed yet was Peter, the unknowing heir.\nPeter had worked as an unofficial intern for over two years. His official title, if anyone asked, was Tony Stark\u2019s personal intern, but he worked in the R&amp;D labs to help out the\u00a0other interns regularly and knew a lot of the interns fairly well. Anyone of the SI Employees who had met Peter had spoken highly of him: polite, funny, slightly shy until he became more comfortable with the environment and started to show his prowess.\u00a0Once he got used to the labs, he was happy to walk around and dabble in people\u2019s projects, giving them needed assistance. The interns were smart \u2014 they had to be, to get into the program. But Peter Parker had a subtle intelligence that was incomparable to any of the other interns. They should loathe him, for being a high school kid and smarter than any of them, but he was too damn nice to hate.\u00a0\nIt was for all these reasons that there was a protocol within Stark Industries called the Young Boss Protocol. It was only to be implemented if both Pepper Potts and Tony Stark were both in emergency situations, and needed someone to take over Stark Industries for a period of time. Peter Parker would immediately become head of command, taking his rightful position as the Heir. Peter, of course, had no clue about either of these: being the heir or the Young Boss protocol. Every time Tony tried to bring it up with Peter, he chickened out. The kid was so unbelievably ignorant of the entire situation, despite being a literal genius. He\u2019d assumed some whispers about being the heir would have trickled down, but nothing. Pepper and May had left the subject to Tony to encroach upon. Tony had eventually, after much dabbling, brought it up with Peter when they\u2019d been tinkering on Mark 62, the latest Iron Man suit.\n\u201cPepper and I have been thinking,\u201d Tony had said, spinning a spanner in his hand loosely. \u201cHow do you feel about maybe\u2026having a bigger role in Stark Industries?\u201d\u00a0\nPeter looked at him with a grin, attention shifted from the helmet he was tinkering with. \u201cLike\u2026an intern?\u201d\u00a0\nAn intern. Tony was supposed to be telling the Kid that he was the heir to the company, and he thought he was going to be an intern. He wanted to chuckle. Pepper had agreed that it was better to tell Peter earlier than later. Hell, everyone else pretty much could tell that Peter was the future of Stark Industries. From the way he could casually walk into the intern labs and solve equations without spending more than a second looking at it, and from the endless amount of official projects he had cut budgets on by solving problems, it was clear. His selfless nature left everyone else in awe, and Peter was still coming out of those situations thinking he\u2019d done the normal thing, just to help people out.\u00a0\nTony smiled at him, \u201cI was thinking a little more like Intern Director.\u201d\u00a0\nHe couldn\u2019t just drop the whole \u2018heir\u2019 thing on Peter quite yet. The kid would probably faint on the spot, especially if he\u2019d been so excited about just being a proper intern. They\u2019d have to phase up to it. That was okay - that was what the Young Boss protocol was supposed to be for, anyways. To get Peter used to being in control of Stark Industries.\n\u201cIntern director?\u201d Peter\u2019s mouth fell open, and he somehow managed to knock the tub of Stark Raving Hazelnuts ice cream onto the floor. They\u2019d had a mini fridge and freezer installed in the lab ever since Tony found out that Peter was significantly more efficient and more creative if he constantly snacked on something. Also, the both of them managed to forget that their bodies needed food to function, and would just work for nine hours before collapsing from hunger they hadn\u2019t noticed. The ice cream was a favourite of Peters, so Tony made sure he kept a permanent stock of it in the freezer, amongst other things. When Ben and Jerrys had asked if Tony wanted to discontinue the flavour (as it was only supposed to be a limited edition), he\u2019d arranged for their creative team to meet Peter, who had begged the entire company to keep it going. There had been tears: it had worked surprisingly well, and the director of Ben and Jerrys had agreed to continuing Stark Raving Hazelnuts after meeting Peter, possibly out of fear. It had then quickly become a permanent flavour, and Tony had silently thanked the lord. He didn\u2019t want to live in a world where Peter\u2019s favourite ice cream flavour was discontinued.\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, kid. You\u2019d be looking over the interns, keeping them on track. If they have any requests or demands that override their intern head, they can come to you.\u201d Technically, that would be part of Peter\u2019s role once he became the fully-fledged boss, so Tony wasn\u2019t lying. An intern director would be a good role for the kid, even if it had just been made up on the spot. He basically checked up on all of the interns anyways, when he was wandering around the labs. This just made it official. Tony made a mental note to make sure that SI hadn\u2019t already hired an intern director. That would be a conflict of interest. There were intern heads of course\u2026.Tony mentally scoured through the list of employees for Stark Industries Research and Development team. Hmm. Pepper would not be pleased.\u00a0\n\u201cBut Mr Stark\u2026\u201d Peter\u2019s brow furrowed, \u201cI\u2019m only seventeen? Surely there\u2019s someone more capable to be the director of all the interns? I mean holy moly, I\u2019ve never even had a proper job before, except working for one summer at Delmar\u2019s!\u201d\u00a0\nTony stared at him. \u201cPete, kid. You\u2019ve been working with me for years. You\u2019re the smartest person I know except for maybe myself and Bruce Banner. You\u2019ve got this.\u201d\u00a0\nPeter started to shake his head. \u201cBut I have, like, no experience managing people!\u201d\u00a0\nTony looked at his kid, wearing a crumpled hoodie donning the words, \u2018what part of [incredibly complicated maths equation] do you not understand?\u2019. He\u2019d seen Peter Parker argue with him to death about repulsor technology, quite correctly in the end. Peter had presented his argument with a completely calm face, voice getting louder but remaining clear to understand. It had in fact become quite scary. He\u2019d be able to manage people no problem.\u00a0\n\u201cTrust me kid, you\u2019ll ace it. And if you don\u2019t like it, then we\u2019ll find you a different role. But you\u2019ve got this,\u201d Tony punched his kid\u2019s arm, and watched as Peter gulped and nodded.\u00a0\nUnbeknownst to him, from then on, Peter Parker\u00a0was third in command. Pepper, as CEO, still ranked first, and then Tony. But ranking above any of the other heads of departments or members of the board was Peter. The appropriate people had been informed, intern heads and the like, and this information had quietly trickled down to the lower-level employees. Anyone who questioned why \u2018some teenager\u2019 now ranked above them was reprimanded strongly by Pepper herself. And no-one went against Pepper Potts. \u00a0\nIt turned out that Peter was actually a very good manager. The shy kid from Midtown high school who sat in the back had no problem reprimanding some of the interns for when they had exploded a room, although had acknowledged that it was an accident, and had been pleasant in reminding them that they needed to either \u2018check their equations before doing the experiment\u2019 or \u2018relocate to one of the explosive-proof rooms!\u2019 Peter had quite enjoyed overseeing all of the interns' projects: he\u2019d actually given some of them other ideas to spring off.\u00a0It had led to several inventions being published with Peter\u2019s name attached to them, which pleased him greatly.\u00a0\nPeter had to manage school alongside his job, so his hours were largely in the evening, overseeing projects, and then whenever he had free periods and had the time to. Pepper came and checked on him frequently to make sure he was still doing his homework, as that was equally as important as the work he was doing at Stark Industries. But Peter had never had troubles with schoolwork. This new role just gave him something else to focus on as well.\nTony and Peter still found time to do their lab sessions, in which they talked about the suits and tech they were working on, but also spent the time discussing projects for the business. Learning about the new developments of Stark Industries, to keep Peter up to date with SI projects. He quite quickly found himself settling into the role, even enjoying it. As Peter started to confess how much he liked the role to Tony, Tony suggested causally that he should come to a meeting with some clients. \u201cYou know, Intern Director, you should be kept informed! Come to a meeting, it will be fun. You don\u2019t have to say or do anything,\u201d Tony had waved a spanner at Peter.\u00a0\u201cJust be yourself.\u201d\u00a0\nThe first board meeting Peter had been invited to, he\u2019d been quiet but attentive. He\u2019d turned up in a shirt with a fitted cashmere sweater, explaining that he\u2019d spent his first pay check on buying some fancy clothes. Tony had freaked out, seeing Peter in clothes that weren\u2019t nerd t-shirts, but had kept it internal, and told the kid that he looked, \u2018appropriate\u2019.\u00a0\nPeter had sat next to him, and Tony had calmly explained to the clients why there was a \u2018damned high-schooler' in their confidential meeting. The kid sat and listened, watching as Tony described to the directors of a company who had investments in SI why they should stay invested, and the projected stock increase. It was endearing watching the kid make notes in a little notepad.\nThis really wasn\u2019t a meeting that Tony had to attend \u2013 really, it should be Pepper taking the meeting. But hell, the CEO had other things to do than reassure some clients that SI wasn\u2019t going to go under because of their recent commitment to renewable energy. (It wasn\u2019t going to go under: the stocks were higher than they\u2019d ever been under Howard. People really liked the Avengers, and invested in SI as a way to show support). The Avengers had public funding now, because the government had decided to get invested, but all of the extra support (the Quintet, suits and repairs for the suits, as well as extra gear) came from Tony, and therefore by extension, Stark Industries.\u00a0\nPepper and him had agreed that Peter\u2019s first official meeting would be a Tony-led thing, so, hence it had fallen to Tony to lead that meeting with the clients. Later, when Tony and Peter were in the lab, Peter was working on a malfunctioning Iron Man repulsor, and he kept turning the spanner with a force that indicated some frustration. Damn, the kid was bothered. Tony lightly asked Peter what he thought about the meeting. He\u2019d expected a quiet response, something vague like most teenagers would say, a \u2018fine\u2019. Peter had been quiet in the meeting after all. But he\u2019d exploded, complaining about the clients and said that, \u2018they\u2019re making you into a pushover, Mr Stark!\u2019.\nThe kid had bite to him today! Tony grinned, and nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s business Pete. I haven\u2019t dealt with clients in many years, so I let Pepper give them an ass-kicking when they need to. But don\u2019t worry - none of them have a spine. They trust me with their money, they just feel the need to kick up a fuss whenever we join up to new projects.\u201d The kid grumbled some more, muttering something about how he wanted to see Pepper give them a talking to.\u00a0\nTony made a split-second decision he probably should have thought more about. Pete was ready to hear about the YoungBoss protocol. \u201cKid, how would you feel about an emergency protocol that left you in charge of this place for a bit, if Pep and I were indisposed, so to speak?\u2019\n\u201cWhen you say this place\u2026\" Pete glanced around the lab.\u00a0\n\u201cStark Industries. The New York branch, mainly. Hong Kong and London too, if Pep isn\u2019t over there already.\u201d Tony waved his hand loosely, accidentally whacking DUM-E in the face. \u201cSorry, buddy.\u201d\u00a0\nPeter\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u2019\u2019Mr Stark\u2026\u201d He was speechless.\u00a0\nTony\u2019s mouth quirked up into another smile. \u201cI\u2019m taking that as a yes.\u201d Peter was definitely going to reject the offer, but the YoungBoss protocol was already up and running. All it needed now was a confirmation from Peter. And all Pete needed was a little bit of confidence. This protocol would give him the confidence he needed, and anyways. It was only for emergencies.\u00a0\n\u201cTony. I can\u2019t\u2026\u201d Peter ran a hand through his hair, \u201cI can\u2019t run a company.\u201d Pete looked like he was going to have a full-scale panic attack. Tony needed to go into damage control mode, now.\u00a0\n\u201cHey, kid, it probably won\u2019t ever happen,\u201d Tony reassured. \u201cIf Pep isn\u2019t around, I normally am. It\u2019s just in case of emergencies, you\u2019re the one we trust the most. No biggie.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Pete was biting his nails, \u201cBut Mr Stark...only if you promise that it\u2019s emergency ONLY.\u201d\n\u201cOf course, Pete. Course. No big deal.\u201d Tony fist-bumped the kid, both of them smiling.\u00a0Okay, so maybe Peter wasn\u2019t entirely ready to hear about being the heir, but this was a big step. He was proud.\u00a0\nFrom then on, Peter was in countless meetings with Pepper and Tony, when he felt up to it. He was still balancing senior year alongside Spiderman and practically a full-time job. Although it wasn\u2019t too much of a burden \u2013 Pepper and Tony always made sure he didn\u2019t have too much to do, and were more than happy to take work from him if he needed it. Senior year was basically boring anyways: Peter was fluent in Spanish and Italian now, mainly because of Tony\u2019s influence. All of the science and Maths subjects were easy as pie, anyways, and he would pass English even if he hadn\u2019t read the books they\u2019d been set. School was a piece of cake.\u00a0\u00a0\nHis real education, now, came from learning the ins and outs of Stark Industries. If the protocol where he was the boss was ever activated, he would be expected to lead meetings and control all of the assets of SI. For that, he needed to know about all of the departments. Sales, Legal, R&amp;D, Assembly and Production, HR, etc. He spent countless hours going through new Stark Industries initiatives with either Pepper, Tony, or a folder and a wad of papers about the initiatives. He knew about renewable energy, the arc reactor, prosthetics, the Starkphones and all of the other wider technological advances that the company was working on.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe first time the YoungBoss protocol had been implemented was for an emergency which had happened in Peter\u2019s winter break. Tony had been out on an Avengers mission in Washington State \u2013 some army using Chitauri tech which had been zuped up by an extremely intelligent technician who had been forced into it. The Avengers had stepped in to take over the mission from the Washington Police department, mainly because Bruce personally knew the technician, who had been kidnapped to make the weapons and tortured. The farmhouse that the enemies\u2019 base was in was abandoned, and had no cell service. Even if he could have left the fight, FRIDAY wouldn\u2019t have been able to call him.\u00a0\nPepper, at the same time, had been out running and had fallen down a flight of stairs and had broken her ankle. She would be perfectly fine, of course, and had insisted to Tony that she could run the company whilst in hospital, until it was revealed that one of the tendons in her ankle had been severely damaged and she needed to have surgery under anaesthesia to get the surgeons to fix it. Running the company unconscious was not possible, so, FRIDAY, recognising that that both Tony and Pepper were MIA, contacted Peter.\u00a0\u00a0\nPeter had been building legos with Ned, a Star Wars set that he\u2019d been wanting to build for the past month, when he\u2019d got the notification. Well, it had actually been Ned who had picked up his phone and had said, \u201cUhhh\u2026Peter\u2026\u201d\nPeter had seen the 'YoungBoss Protocol has now been activated\u2019 notification straight from FRIDAY and had sped over to his bag, shoving the cashmere sweater into the bag and\u00a0pulling on the Spiderman suit.\u00a0\n\u201cI have to go, Ned,\u201d he said breathlessly, no explanation, and had jumped out of the window whilst saying, \u2018I\u2019ll text you later!\u2019 Ned didn\u2019t even know about the YoungBoss protocol. Honestly, it had slipped Peter\u2019s mind. He hadn\u2019t thought it would actually happen.\u00a0\nIt was faster to swing to his workplace than to get public transport. He hadn\u2019t meant to come into Stark Industries until the next day, because he\u2019d caught up on all of his paperwork and only did alternate days anyways as Intern Director. It was his winter break, and Tony had insisted he at least had some fun, even if Peter\u2019s definition of fun was to spend hours in the lab with Tony working on tech.\u00a0\nPeter knew Tony was on an Avengers mission, but what the hell had happened to Pepper? That was his first priority, before finding out what he had to do as now temporary Boss of Stark Industries. Holy shit. He was the actual Boss of Stark Industries. Damn.\u00a0\n\u201cKaren, what happened to Pepper?\u201d He called out to his AI, swinging in the direction of the Tower.\n\u201cMiss Potts went running and broke her ankle. She\u2019s going to be fine, but she has to have surgery to check one of her tendons.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cOh, man! That sucks. I hope she\u2019s okay! Can you patch me in to Tony?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s not available right now, Peter. FRIDAY said he\u2019s in a remote area, and in the middle of a fight. That\u2019s why the YoungBoss protocol was activated\u201d\n\u201cUh, okay. Thanks, Karen.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s no problem, Peter.\u201d Well, shit. Pepper in surgery and Tony unreachable. He really was in charge.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen he swung into one of the open windows of one of the personal labs, he landed in Tony\u2019s lab, where he was awaited with a surprise.\u00a0\n\u201cWoah,\u201d Peter stared at the suit in front of him. It was a really nice suit, with a post-it note attached to it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nPeter\u00a0\n\n\nI thought you needed a suit,\u00a0\n\n\nas you\u2019re the Boss now. Smash it.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0- Tony\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nMr Stark had bought him a suit? Well, no wasting time. He quickly pulled off the Spiderman suit and put on his new suit, which fit perfectly. Then he pulled on his badge, which just said Peter Parker - Intern Director. He kept forgetting it and it made Happy really upset when he did. Peter then webbed the bag with the Spidey suit in it to the wall of the lab. It wasn\u2019t like anyone would be able to get in the lab other than him, anyways, but best not to leave the suit lying on the floor.\u00a0\nAfter the preparation, he finally jumped on the lift to go down to the offices and asked for Friday.\u00a0\n\u201cHi, Boss. How can I help you today.\u201d Peter jumped. FRIDAY called Mr Stark \u2018Boss\u2019, not him.\u00a0\n\u201cOh, Friday...don\u2019t call me Boss. I\u2019m not Mr Stark, just call me Peter like usual.\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re sure, Peter.\u201d Yeah, that was better. Less formalities, the better. This was temporary. Peter was nervous \u2014 in charge of a whole company!\u00a0\nHe breathed out, then asked, \u201cWhat is there that I need to do?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a Board of Directors meeting that starts in half an hour, which was of course supposed to be led by Pepper. It's to talk about the Starkphones and the next steps for them. Pepper left a research file on her desk that may help you out with that. Legal is also having some issues with a contract, R&amp;D could use with some assistance as well, but that\u2019s less of a priority. The intern heads have it sorted for now.\u201d\n\u201cThanks, FRI. So Board of directors first. Any other meetings?\u201d\n\u201cColonel Williamson is coming from the US military later on this afternoon, at 4pm.\u201d\nOh god, the military. Great. Peter mentally groaned. In his time of initiation for this role, anyone from the military other than Rhodey had never been co-operative. He wasn\u2019t looking forward to that.\u00a0\nFRIDAY could clearly sense his discomfort. \u201cI could suggest that he rearranges for the next day if you would prefer.\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cNo, no, it's okay, FRIDAY. I\u2019ve got this.\u201d Peter cracked his knuckles, one by one. The lift was empty. FRIDAY was fast-tracking him to Pepper\u2019s office without letting anyone else on. Floor 58 had its own entrance room, like a hallway to the office. Pepper\u2019s receptionist, Eva, waved at Peter and quickly let him into the office. The room itself had been stunningly designed, with full-length windows and a desk the size of a dining room table. Pepper had truly made it her own after Tony had moved all of his stuff out. There were houseplants everywhere and the white walls made it open and bright.\u00a0But Peter had more important things to think about than design.\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, let\u2019s do this.\u201d\u00a0It felt weird to sit in Pepper\u2019s chair, but Peter needed to do it to find the file that FRIDAY had mentioned. He sat, spinning around in the chair slowly, as he read the document. Most of the stuff he already knew from just talking with the R&amp;D department about the new specs for the Starkphones, but Peter needed a bit of a brush up on the new photo mode they were adding that meant that any Stark Drone would be able to operate through the camera application instead of an external app. The drones were going to be included in a bundle with the new phone to encourage customers to buy them.\n\u201cOkay, battery duration, preventing storage issues, drone cam. I think I\u2019ve got it. FRIDAY, where\u2019s the meeting?\u201d Peter stood up, folder in hand. He tugged on the blazer he wore, trying to get used to the suit.\u00a0\n\u201cUsual place. The lift is ready for you, Peter.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThanks Friday,\u201d Peter smiled and strolled into the lift, taking a deep breath. First Solo meeting.\u00a0\nThere was a low rumbling of, \u201cMr Parker,\u201d and several nods from the Board. Peter wasn\u2019t expecting any complaints from these guys. Peter had been in several board meetings. He\u2019d never led any of them, but he often contributed and the Board had been informed of the YoungBoss protocol.\u00a0\n\u201cIs Pepper joining us today?\u201d One of the board members, James Young, glanced at the door when everyone was seated.\n\u201cShe\u2019s in surgery, I\u2019m afraid. I\u2019ll direct this meeting and then feedback to her. I promise, anything you say to her you shouldn\u2019t hold out on saying to me.\u201d\u00a0Peter smiled, the business smile that Tony had trained him to do.\nMr Young nodded and looked down at his papers.\u00a0Good, no trouble from him.\n\u201cNow, should we start with the specs for the next generation of Stark Phone?\u201d\u00a0There was a collective nod, and the meeting began.\u00a0\nIt went well. Peter felt a bit more relaxed after the meeting was done, and there had been no complications. Peter had calmly delivered the information as Pepper would have done. Any questions the board members had had been answered. On the lift back to Pepper\u2019s office, Peter pulled out his phone, concerned by the endless notifications he\u2019d received during the meeting, causing his pocket to continue vibrating throughout the meeting.\u00a0\nFifteen texts from Ned, all concerned about where he went abruptly, without explanation.\u00a0Well, that was fair enough. He probably should have explained, but he\u2019d been in a time crunch to get to the meeting.\u00a0\n\nNed: Dude.\n\n\nNed: Where did you go? May is wondering\n\n\nNed: Do you want me to carry on with the Death Star?\u00a0\n\n\nNed: ???\n\nAnd three missed calls from May, and a text asking where he was.\u00a0Peter groaned and punched himself in the forehead, dropping the folder he was carrying. The sheets sprawled everywhere and he quickly called May back whilst he shuffled the papers into a pile.\u00a0He was an idiot, forgetting to tell May.\n\u201cHey, May,\u201d he said, slightly breathless. He really should have texted her.\u00a0\nMay let out an outburst of questions. \u201cIs this some Spiderman thing? There\u2019s nothing on the news \u2013 is this a secret Avengers fight?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNo, no, May. I\u2019m at Stark Industries. It\u2019s, um\u2026the YoungBoss protocol, remember?\u201d\u00a0Tony had informed May of it, explaining that it would only be enacted in emergencies and Peter wouldn\u2019t be expected to do anything he wasn\u2019t comfortable doing. But truly, May trusted Tony now, and he hadn\u2019t needed to explain much before she\u2019d agreed.\u00a0\n\u201cOh. Do you need me to do anything? Are Pepper and Tony okay?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cPepper is having surgery for her ankle, but she\u2019s going to be fine. Tony is at a secret Avengers thing, so\u2026\u201d\u00a0There was an awkward silence.\n\u201cYou\u2019re in charge,\u201d May said, a bit speechless. \u201cYou\u2019re in charge of Stark Industries.\u201d\u00a0\nPeter let out a breath, eyes darting around the lift for something to look at. \u201cYup.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll let you get on with your day,\u201d May said, voice slightly high pitched, as though she couldn\u2019t quite get her head round it. Peter didn\u2019t blame her. He couldn\u2019t quite comprehend it either. \u201cDon\u2019t forget to have lunch!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cTell Ned I\u2019m sorry, please. We\u2019ll have to take a raincheck. Thanks, May.\u201d\u00a0\nHe settled back in Pepper\u2019s office, spinning around the chair. \u201cFRIDAY. Legal, next?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI believe that would be the best course of action. I could have the contract sent up to you if you\u2019d prefer not to go down there.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s okay.\u201d Peter stood up and wandered back over to the lift. \u201cWill you explain the problem to me on the way there?\u201d\u00a0\nFRIDAY explained the issue they were having \u2014 just some lawsuit with a newspaper publishing libel about Stark Industries and their weapons business. The head of legal, a guy named Andrew Maguire, needed a signature from a higher up to authorise the lawsuit they were pursuing against this newspaper. Apparently, Peter\u2019s would do as well as Pepper\u2019s or Tony\u2019s, because he was acting CEO. Who knew!\nThe legal department, from Peter\u2019s experience at least, was always a rush of people running places whilst holding bundles of papers and folders in their hands, looking stressed. He went over to a couple of people who looked particularly stressed and tried to help solve their problems, even if some of the legal talk went completely over his head. After lending a hand to a couple of people, he went over to Maguire and signed the necessary paper. Maguire thanked him kindly for the signature, and left Peter to get on with his day.\u00a0\nHis next stop, of course was R&amp;D, his favourite department in the entirety of Stark Industries. This was where the magic happened: the ideas that became reality, and were produced. The was the stuff that got Peter\u2019s serotonin levels flooding. However, as he walked in, the Intern Head in charge of all the interns who dealt with Starkphone developments, Lisa, approached him. \u201cPeter, lovely to see you.\u201d Lisa was blocking his entrance to the interns. Peter was itching to start helping them out, but alas, Lisa was an obstacle. \u00a0\n\u201cHi, Lisa. How are you?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cBrilliant. I heard you are in charge today. How is it going?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, I think. Any explosions down here?\u201d Peter glanced into the labs. He could see Jasper \u2014 Jasper was this buddy of his who\u2019d gone to MIT for college, and had told him all of the ins and outs of the college experience. He wanted to go and work on their project together. But his eyes danced back to Lisa.\u00a0\n\u201cNo, I think we\u2019ve got it handled. Feel free to have a wander, I know what you\u2019re like. But Peter, before you go, do you know what time it is?\u201d\n\u201cUh\u2026No?\u201d Peter glanced down at his watch (a subtly personalised Spiderman-themed Stark Watch that he adored, a gift from Pepper and Tony for his birthday.) Holy crap! It was 2:15. Hell, time had flown. Maybe he\u2019d spent longer in Legal than he\u2019d thought.\u00a0\n\u201cHave you had lunch yet?\u201d Lisa asked, clearly concerned. He sheepishly shook his head.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be back!\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t doubt that!\u201d\nHe grabbed his normal sandwich from the pop-up Delmars store that Tony had insisted be installed in the tower after he had met Mr Delmar and had learnt how much the man had helped out May and Peter when times had been hard. The free sandwich here and there had made all the difference throughout Peter\u2019s childhood. As a result, Mr Delmar\u2019s son now worked in Stark Industries in the cafeteria. They\u2019d become fast friends, as Peter liked to eat sandwiches and Mr Delmar\u2019s son was a Spiderman fan who liked to make Peter the sandwiches.\u00a0\nSandwich in hand, he returned to the the R&amp;D department to tinker with some projects he\u2019d been keeping an eye on. Lisa gave him a thumbs up, which he returned, and he got to work. He spent an hour working on all sorts of projects, from experimental virtual reality technology to a prosthetic leg that was missing a couple of bolts. FRIDAY then buzzed at him that it was 3:30 and he should head up to the offices to prepare for the meeting with the guy from the army.\u00a0\nOn the way up to Pepper\u2019s office, he did a quick Google to read up on Colonel Williamson. He\u2019d requested a meeting without giving Pepper any indication for what it would be. Peter had been briefed on how to deal with the military, which was basically just to say no to any demand and try not to get too angry. Colonel Williamson wasn\u2019t particularly intimidating. Sure, he was a tall bald guy with bulky muscles, but Tony had told Peter to just look at his moustache and concentrate on that, because the moustache that the Colonel had was very distinctive. Peter had thought that Tony had been joking, but he was right. Williamson\u2019s moustache WAS very distinctive.\u00a0\n\u201cI was expecting to see Pepper Potts?\u201d The Colonel looked him up and down.\nPeter quite calmly looked at the colonel\u2019s moustache and simply said, \u201cPepper is currently having emergency surgery. I am having the meeting with you instead.\u201d\n\u201cWell, this is preposterous, you look about sixteen. You should be in school, not trying to lead a meeting.\u201d Well, apparently the US military hadn\u2019t been told about the YoungBoss protocol, which made sense as they work on an external contract. It truly was a shame that Williamson hadn\u2019t been to any of the meetings that Tony had with the military since the YoungBoss protocol was implemented, because he\u2019s about to make a fool of himself by continuing to undermine Peter\u2019s authority.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s winter break,\u201d Peter said, still calm. He watched the way the Colonel\u2019s face reddened in anger.\n\u201cI\u2019d like to speak to someone higher up than some low-level intern doing admin for Stark Industries. I\u2019m from the US military, for god\u2019s sake. Get me your manager.\u201d The Colonel had decided to turn into a Karen now, great. He was definitely not going to like the plot twist that Peter in fact is the manager.\n\u201cI am the manager,\u201d Peter said, his voice rising slightly in volume. \u201cPlease sit down, Colonel. I am perfectly qualified to have this meeting with you.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry, I won\u2019t discuss intricate military policies with a kid. There\u2019s no way you\u2019re qualified.\u201d Peter struggled not to roll his eyes. Yeah, Tony was right. These guys were stubborn assholes. There was only one solution that could possibly make the Colonel believe him, short of Tony walking in himself and confirming it. \u00a0\n\u201cFRIDAY, Could you please play the tape that Mr Stark recorded?\u201d Tony had recorded a tape for people who weren\u2019t Stark Industries employees who didn\u2019t believe that Peter could possibly be in charge.\u00a0They\u2019d anticipated this scenario happening, mostly because Peter still looked so young, and people were dicks.\n\u201cOf course Peter.\u201d FRIDAY played the audio recording.\n\u201cListen up, folks. I don\u2019t know who you are, but let me just inform you. Peter Parker is currently operating as intermediary CEO to Stark Industries, filling in for Pepper or myself, Tony Stark of course. He is perfectly capable of leading any meeting and knows the ins and outs of everything going on at Stark Industries. Please do not attempt to undermine his authority, or he is well within his right to cut off our contract with you, or terminate your employment.\u201d The Colonel huffed and when the tape reached its end, he looked extremely angry with the tone that Mr Stark had used.\u00a0\n\u201cSo, Colonel. Shall we sit?\u201d Clearly still unhappy, he grumbled and sat down.\u00a0\n\u201cSo, how come you get to be in charge whilst so young?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ve been the personal intern of Mr Stark for years now and was recently promoted to Intern Director. Tony and Pepper have trained me so I have in-depth knowledge of every aspect of the company and I am perfectly qualified to handle meetings like these. But I believe we are not here to discuss my employment, and you did not provide a subject matter, so you should start.\u201d Peter was really looking forward to what the Colonel had to say. He fidgeted with a pen under his desk (Pepper\u2019s desk, technically).\u00a0\n\u201cWell, the US military wanted to thank Mr Stark for his work with us in the past, and we have no problems with our current contracts of course. This company has treated us extremely well over the years, but we wish to\u2026adapt some of the contracts for another purpose, possibly.\u201d The Colonel had said many words and none of them actually contained anything worthwhile. Peter felt the need to clarify.\n\u201cWe work with the US military primarily for energy supplies and other minor technological contracts, Colonel. These contracts are non-negotiable and unchanging. I believe you are talking about opening a new contract with us, but what for?\u201d Peter could guess where this was going, and he did not want to entertain the possibility.\nThe colonel shifted in his seat uncomfortably. \u2018No, I know that. But the military had a proposition for Mr Stark\u2014\u201d\nPeter immediately cut the Colonel off. \u201cIf this is about weapons, I will remind you that Tony Stark stated ten years ago, after being kidnapped and tortured in Afghanistan, we at Stark Industries no longer manufacture, create, or want to supply weapons, to the US military or anyone else.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not stupid. I know Stark Industries doesn\u2019t make weapons anymore.\u201d The Colonel took the time to have a sip of his coffee. Peter very determinedly stared at his moustache which had droplets of coffee in it. The Colonel continued. \u201cI want to commission Tony, to make us some sets of armour for our use.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nPeter felt the volume of his voice raise as he continued talking.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling me that you want self-operated, military-owned Iron Man suits?! Didn\u2019t Justin Hammer try that? I\u2019m pretty sure that went down badly \u2013 wasn't there some kind of attack?\u201d The Colonel blatantly ignored him, which was fair enough. It was a bit accusatory, and the whole HammerTech contract was probably a mistake the US army wanted to hide under their radar.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cTony knows what he is doing with these suits,\u201d The Colonel stated. \u201cWe know he has now made at least twenty of these suits for his personal use.\u201d Peter quirked an eyebrow. Twenty? That was an understatement. \u201cAnd he and the company would be paid very well for doing this for the military.\u201d\n\u201cTony Stark is a billionaire who knows how to invest, Colonel. With all due respect, I don\u2019t think Mr Stark, nor the company, needs your money.\u201d Peter took a breath. \u201cLook, Colonel. Tony only does things that he knows are morally correct. He has been kind enough to the United States military, I would think, after giving you the very suit that War Machine currently operates, for free may I add.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWar Machine is one man. He cannot protect all of the interests we need defended. These suits\u2014\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nBut Peter had heard enough, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a no, Colonel. The US military has no right to guilt trip this company into supplying the military. Our energy contract remains out of formality from the past. Tony would not want his suits operating for you.\u201d\n\u201cI will be speaking to Pepper about this.\u201d The Colonel warned.\n\u201cI would suggest you do not attempt to do that. I will be informing her, of course, the content of this meeting and I assure you, she will agree with me wholly.\u201d Pepper would probably talk more nicely, but it would be the sentiment. There would be no way that Tony would ever commission Iron Man suits for the military.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t take the word of a child,\u201d the Colonel spat at him.\u00a0\n\u201cIt sounds like you\u2019re undermining my authority. I would be careful doing that, Colonel.\u201d Peter stood up, and so did Colonel Williamson.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cYou can tell Tony Stark that his son is exactly like him: abrasive, arrogant, and a pain in the ass.\u2019 With that, the Colonel stalked out of the room, fuming. Peter could imagine the steam smoking out of his ears. He kind of wanted MJ to sketch it, just to have as an image. He shook his head. Business, today.\u00a0\n\u201cGoodbye Colonel. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be seeing you again soon!\u201d Peter called out as the Colonel practically ran away down the corridor. Then he collapsed back in his seat. Damn, one hell of a meeting. He glanced to the ceiling. \u201cTell me you were recording that, FRIDAY?\u201d\n\u201cOf course, Peter. Unless you ask me not to, I record every meeting that happens in here. Do you want me to share the recording with anyone?\u201d Hell no. He didn\u2019t want anyone to see that the Colonel had called him that. It would be too embarrassing for Tony to see, especially, and he would probably kick the shit out of the Colonel just for his tone.\n\u201cNo, not yet. Maybe Pepper when she\u2019s back, to catch her up to speed. That man is a piece of work.\u201d\n\u201cIs there anything else I can help you with?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNo, noth\u2014well, actually,\u201d Peter hesitated. \u201cFRIDAY, are Mr Stark and I really that similar?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI have analysed your speech patterns and have found that they match 85% of the time, in reference to your tone, inflection and level of sarcasm. Especially when you\u2019re at work here, they tend to align.\u201d\n\u201cWell, Jeez. That guy just called me Mr Stark\u2019s son. That\u2019s embarrassing. I didn\u2019t even correct him.\u201d Peter sat up, \u201cI didn\u2019t even correct him, oh god.\u201d\n\u201cBoss always calls you Kid. It's a fair assumption. Colonel Williamson was not the first to assume that you two are biologically related.\u201d\nPeter spun around in his chair, \u201cWhat\u2014 FRIDAY?! Who else has?\u201d\n\u201cCaptain Rogers made the connection when he was first introduced to you. And I believe Colonel Rhodes and Boss had a very distinct talk after that time he walked into a lab and you were encased an Iron Man suit that you were working on with Tony. The Colonel was hyperventilating for most of it, assuming you had been neglected for 15 years of your life.\u201d\n\u201cRhodey? Rhodey thought we were related?\u201d Peter\u2019s eyebrows shot up, \u201cWow, seriously? Isn\u2019t he like, Tony\u2019s best friend?\u201d\n\u201cThey have known each other since Boss was in MIT as a teenager. And yes, he did think you were related. Tony may have led him on for a little bit before telling the truth.\u201d\n\u201cWow, that\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d Peter chuckled to himself and then paused. \u201cWait\u2026did you say Captain Rogers? As in Captain America? As in Mr Steve Rogers Captain America?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYes, he also thought you were Tony\u2019s son.\u201d Peter sat back in his chair. It actually made a lot of sense. When he\u2019d met Steve, the man had been extremely twitchy and wide-eyed around Peter.\n\u201cIs that why he was so weird around me the first time we met? He kept asking me questions about where I was from and my childhood and stuff. Huh, that makes sense. Why on earth did he think we were related?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019d have to ask him that yourself Peter, but I can think of a few similarities.\u201d Best not to think about that, the fact that he was apparently similar to his boss/mentor/father-figure. Hopefully Tony hadn\u2019t noticed. Speaking of\u2026\n\u201cIs Tony back online yet?\u201d It would be nice to talk to him, see if there were any problems with Stark Industries that Tony had noticed which Peter could work on, as there were no more meetings for the day.\n\u201cNot yet I\u2019m afraid. He\u2019s only operating on offline FRIDAY for now, whilst I\u2019m online with the Stark servers. I\u2019m sure he will be soon though.\u201d Probably still in the middle of the mission. He knew how time-consuming certain fights were, and this being a hostage situation he understood the sensitivity. It wasn\u2019t like his call was an emergency, anyways.\u00a0\n\u201cThanks FRIDAY. Is it okay if I go back to R&amp;D for a bit?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re the boss, Peter.\u201d FRIDAY said, humoured.\n\u201cOh, yeah! I\u2019m going to go to R&amp;D.\u201d Back in his favourite department, Lisa requested his assistance in an issue they\u2019d been having with finding the ambient operating temperature for the new Starkphone. After some deliberation and testing, Peter had figured it out and sped up production by a whole week, giving them more time to perfect the Starkphone &amp; Drone Bundle instead of worrying about the phone\u2019s release. They knew it would sell \u2014 the phones always did, they were reasonably priced, good quality, and better than any others on the market. He let the Advertising department down in Public Relations know about the decreased time needed for production, and then moved on.\u00a0\nAfter helping an intern named Isaac finish off the prosthetic he\u2019d been working on earlier that afternoon and dancing around to help a few others with familiar faces, he glanced at his phone to see that he\u2019d had a missed call from Pepper. She must have been out of surgery. He signed out of the lab for the night, waving goodbye to Jasper and the others, before returning to Mr Stark\u2019s personal penthouse. Then he called Pepper back.\u00a0\n\u201cPepper! Hi, are you okay?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cPerfectly fine, my ankle is all better, thank you. How are you? How was your day as Boss?\u201d She sounded tired, Peter noted. That made sense, after the day she\u2019d had.\u00a0\nPeter thought about it, reviewing the day in his mind. Really, he wanted to explain everything that happened to him in detail, because there was just so much, but she\u2019d just gotten out of surgery and probably had had an equally tiring day as him. She deserved to rest without him just dumping all of his problems on her. \u201cIt was exhausting, but good I think. No explosions.\u201d\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s better than some of the times Tony has been left in charge. Although normally he\u2019s the one who makes the explosions.\u201d Pepper chuckled.\n\u201cI spoke to Colonel Williamson. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll come back for a while, I was a bit, um\u2026firm.\u201d Peter chose a nice word to describe his behaviour, thinking back to the insults. Pepper didn\u2019t need to know about that.\u00a0\n\u201cThanks, Peter, you\u2019re a star. I really didn\u2019t want to deal with him. I just get distracted by his moustache.\u201d Pepper mused. \u201cAnyways, order some dinner and you can crash in the penthouse if you want, or swing back home. I don\u2019t mind. I think Tony will be on his way back soon.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOh, cool! I might be asleep by then, but thanks. I\u2019ll grab some dinner.\u201d\n\u201cThank you for today, Peter. It sounds like you did a great job.\u201d Well, nothing broken at least. He smiled.\n\u201cNo problem! I hope you feel better! Bye!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cGoodbye.\u201d Pepper hung up and Peter called the pizza place to get his usual order delivered. He would have ordered something from the cafeteria down below but it was actually later than he\u2019d thought, so the cafeteria was closed. Even Mr Delmar\u2019s son had gone home. Soon he\u2019d ordered his usual (an extra large stuffed crust pizza with all sorts of toppings and barbecue sauce).\u00a0\nThen he collapsed on the sofa, thinking about the day. Peter forced his brain not to focus on the actual work side, avoiding thinking about any of the interns projects, but more the interns himself. It had been a busy day, but he wished there had been more time to actually connect with the people at Stark Industries, get to know them. Understanding the company as a whole was necessary to being a CEO, that\u2019s what Pepper said anyways. And the employees were key to the company. If he got the time, maybe over his next school break, he would go on a tour of the building. Mentally he drew up plans for next time he visited, to at least meet some new people. When his pizza finally arrived, his stomach rumbling, he started scrolling on various social media apps as he ate, to distract himself from thinking. Peter was so exhausted though, so after he finished his pizza, he sent a quick text to May explaining that his day had gone well and that he was planning on sleeping at the Tower, and then he felt himself dozing off on the sofa.\nHe remained that way for at least a couple of hours, flat out asleep, until there was a shuffling of footsteps and someone quietly flickered one of the lights on. One of Peter\u2019s eyes lazily opened, but he wasn\u2019t worried. The only people who had access to the apartment other than him were Pepper and Tony, and they had to do a biometric scan to get in, anyways. This was just Tony finally arriving home from the mission.\u00a0\nHe was right. \u201cHey Kid,\u201d Tony ruffled his hair as he came into the room. \u201cI heard you gave Williamson a talking to.\u201d\n\u201cHow d\u2019you know? FRI\u2026\u201d Peter was sleepy. He could see Tony, but it was hazy. He was still half asleep, safe in the comfort of Tony\u2019s sofa.\n\u201cNo, FRIDAY didn\u2019t say anything. Pepper told me. I tried your phone but it went straight to voicemail.\u201d Good. Tony hadn\u2019t seen what the Colonel had said about him. Tony sat next to him, in the small space between Peter\u2019s feet and the edge of the sofa.\u00a0\n\u201cS\u2019rry. I was \u2018sleep.\u201d Peter yawned and sat up.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay Kid, your day was probably more tiring that mine.\u201d Tony\u2019s voice sounded exhausted too, though. He probably needed to sleep just as much as Peter did, but hell, they were both pretty much insomniacs. They could handle a five minute chat.\u00a0\n\u201cHow was the mission?\u201d Peter asked.\u00a0\n\u201cIt was all good, we got Brucie\u2019s friend to safety and arrested the bad guys. Clint broke his arm from a fall, but other than that everyone is okay.\u201d Peter bit his lip. Whenever one of them got injured he was reminded of just how breakable they were. Just human, all of them. Well, except Thor, he supposed. Thank god Tony had a suit of metal to keep him mostly protected. He normally came away with a cut at least, but rarely any serious injuries.\n\u201cGood, good.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cSorry for disturbing your Winter break with Stark stuff. I know you wanted to spend some time with your friends.\u201d Peter waved it off.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Mr Stark.\u201d Peter smiled. \u201cIt was a good day. Productive.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cPep\u2019s back to work tomorrow so you\u2019re relieved of your duty as CEO.\u201d Hopefully Ned would be around for a lego session tomorrow, and then he could make up for flaking on him today. Peter could explain to him all the crazy things he\u2019d done today, including shouting at a US military official.\u00a0\n\u201cI think I\u2019m going to sleep for the next 48 hours.\u201d He was exhausted.\u00a0\n\u201cYeah\u2026me too.\u201d Well, that was a lie. Although Mr Stark probably should sleep for the next two days - it would be the most sleep he\u2019d had all year.\u00a0\n\u201cMr Stark we both know you\u2019re going to get four hours sleep and then get cracking on repairing your suit.\u201d Tony chuckled and nodded.\u00a0\n\u201cLook, Pete, well done for today. I don\u2019t say it enough, but you\u2019re a great kid.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThanks, Mr Stark.\u201d\u00a0\nThey quieted and Peter curled up into the sofa, finding his eyes closing once again. Tony did the same. Content, Pete felt himself slipping off into the darkness once again, finally ending the long day he\u2019d had.\u00a0\nWinter break passed, and so did the next two months. Peter found himself swarmed with work, both from Midtown and from Stark Industries, so he never got time to tour the building properly and meet all of the employees as he had promised himself he would do. Pepper had recovered from her surgery quickly and had returned to work. The new launch of the Smartphones had gone well, and the drone bundle had also been successful. Stocks were higher than ever. Peter was happy with all of the interns, their projects and their progress. He\u2019d been able to assist them in getting several inventions created and put into the world, with his name attached to them as a result of his help. Peter was technically a scientist\u00a0 - he\u2019d actually invented things! Things that helped people!\nThe second time the YoungBoss protocol was implemented, Peter had been in a Calculus lesson, chewing on a pencil and staring at the exam paper he had completed thirty minutes ago. He was doodling on the back, in an attempt to figure out this one equation that had caused a halt in the plans for the new household helping robot that SI was producing. If he just thought about it some more, he could definitely figure it out. He was in the middle of thinking about the equation when his phone vibrated in his jeans pocket \u2014 not just once, but three times. Peter wasn\u2019t supposed to look at his phone during tests, obviously, one of the basic rules of school, and Tony had made him promise he wouldn\u2019t slack on his school work in order to respond to messages from the company, but needs must. Anyways, he was done with the paper, and the equation wasn\u2019t going to be solved when he was distracted.\u00a0\nHe snuck the phone out of his pocket and saw the beep had come from FRIDAY. The YoungBoss Protocol had been activated again. There was also a missed call from Tony and a text from two minutes ago that read, \u201cSorry Kid. Give me a ring when you can.\u201d\u00a0\nTony had recently gone under with a bad chest infection, and the Avengers medical team led by Helen Cho had put him on bed rest until it was fixed, which Pepper had enforced with a stern warning. She was in Japan, trying to sort the details for the newest branch of Stark Industries, due to be built in Tokyo. She was talking with contractors and the like, and had decided it was easier if she was in Japan. Any meetings she\u2019d had organised had been postponed until later, but she was still capable of running the other branches of SI whilst in Japan. Peter had told her very explicitly that he was around and would be going to the New York branch every evening to just check up on the place, which he had been doing for the last several days. Tony privately thought it was very funny that Peter was acting like the trainee CEO even though he didn\u2019t know he was the heir yet. Peter was just great like that.\u00a0\nHe quietly cursed to himself, and then put his hand up. Peter really didn\u2019t like drawing attention to himself, not at Midtown, but he had to go, it was an emergency. He had to find out what had happened to Pepper, and then get to work. It took an excruciatingly long thirty seconds before Mr Harrington noticed him.\u00a0\n\u201cCan I please be excused?\u201d He asked. Mr Harrington frowned.\n\u201cWhat about your test?\u201d It took all Peter had not to roll his eyes. The test was embarrassingly easy for a Senior who specialised in science, and engineering specifically. It hadn\u2019t even touched the surface of the equations he dealt with on the daily with the interns. Peter went to college lectures at MIT in his spare time \u2014 the test wasn\u2019t challenging.\n\u201cI\u2019ve finished it.\u201d He handed the paper to Mr Harrington, who raised his eyebrows in disbelief. They still had 45 minutes left to complete the exam. Even Peter, the resident science genius at Midtown, could not possibly complete a test so quickly. It was supposed to be a difficult test \u2014 one of the most difficult ones from the whole curriculum.\nBut Peter knew he wouldn\u2019t flunk. He ran through the corridors to the doors, and didn\u2019t bother signing out of school. Presumably, someone from SI (probably Eva, Pepper\u2019s assistant) would inform them of his absence. He had to get to Stark Industries, there was no time to dawdle.\u00a0\nMr Stark picked up the phone when he rang. He sounded rough, but started apologising immediately. \u201cKid, look, you can go back to school,\u201d Tony tried to put cheer into his voice, but it ended up just turning into a heavy cough. The doctors were worried that this chest infection might cause further issues for his chest and internal organs, which of course needed to be looked after that time Tony was literally fatally stabbed with shrapnel from his own missile. \u201cFRIDAY betrayed me and sent for you, but I can handle this. All I have is just a little cough.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWhat happened to Pepper?\u201d Peter ignored Tony. Of course Tony wasn\u2019t going to be able to run Stark Industries, not in his bedridden state. The wrath of Pepper Potts simply wasn\u2019t worth it.\n\u201cEarthquake in Tokyo. She\u2019s perfectly fine and uninjured, but they\u2019re on lockdown. Several buildings were damaged. Pep won\u2019t be able to run any of the other locations for today, but Pete, I\u2019ve got this.\u201d Tony paused to cough again, this time sounding like a dying animal. \u201cGo back to school, smash that physics test.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI did smash it, just finished it actually. Walked out early. And we both know you can\u2019t run the company with a cough like that. Pepper would kill you. I\u2019ve got this. You trust me, right?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI do trust you, but I don\u2019t want May to come after me for ruining your education.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re not. I don\u2019t even have anything important on for the rest of the day. I\u2019m just here wasting my time. At work, I can actually do some important stuff. This is the whole reason for the YoungBoss protocol, anyways.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWell. Only if you\u2019re sure. I did say emergencies. This isn\u2019t really one. I\u2019m still talking and breathing.\u201d Peter rolled his eyes \u2014 Tony was so dramatic. Thinking he can take care of the company whilst seriously ill, Jeez. Peter had offered, and everything. \u00a0\n\u201cStay in bed. I\u2019ll call if I need anything.\u201d\nTony let out a sigh of relief. \u201cThanks, kid. You\u2019re a star.\u201d\u00a0\nTony hung up, and Peter waited for Happy outside the school gate. He never brought the Spiderman suit to school, so he couldn\u2019t swing to the Tower, hence the need for a pick-up by Happy. But going straight from school did mean he was going to turn up to SI dressed in a geeky science top and jeans, but hey. Tony had bought him a range of fancy suits after seeing Peter in the one he\u2019d gotten from his favourite tailor for the first time the YoungBoss protocol was activated and Peter kept them in his \u2018office\u2019 at Stark Industries, which was essentially a storage room that Tony gave him just to shove all of his extra stuff in. It didn\u2019t have to be tidy, and it wasn\u2019t, but he did at least have a desk.\u00a0\nPeter scrolled to the calendar app on his phone. He and Tony had coded it so that whenever the YoungBoss protocol was activated, Pepper and Tony\u2019s calendar synced to his phone so he could see what meetings they\u2019d had planned. But of course, because of Tony\u2019s sudden illness and Pepper\u2019s escapade to Japan, any face to face meetings had been postponed and arranged for further days, so for the first time in Stark Industries history, probably, he pretty much had a free day. \u00a0\nPeter would really just be there to fix problems that arose. But that was boring, and he was feeling in the mood for chaos. He could just slink up to the lab and play with some new web fluid for a few hours, but he might as well be in school. No, this was a good opportunity to do what he\u2019d been meaning to ever since the YoungBoss protocol had been activated the first time \u2014 actually get to touch with all of the employees \u2014 make meaningful change. He knew the interns like the back of his hand, but for most of the other departments he\u2019d only been in contact with them briefly, and even then, it was mainly the heads of departments rather than the lower-level employees. Peter was leading the whole company, and he didn\u2019t know half of the people he was leading!\u00a0\nStark Industries was split into mainly seven departments within the tower, all working together. They also hired contractors and other companies for manufacturing, but they all worked off-site. The main six departments on-site were Research and Development, Legal, Public Relations,\u00a0 Marketing and Finance, Human Resources, Assembly and Production and last but not least, Security &amp; Maintenance. He figured if he started at the bottom of the Tower, he could swan around in every floor of the tower and solve the problems when he arrived at them.\u00a0\nHappy picked him up without a complaint, handing him his badge as he did so. After Peter had complained to Happy about Colonel Williamson, Happy had made a special one for him titled \u2018Peter Parker - Acting CEO\u2019 so people would stop undermining his authority. Peter hated it. Tony had laughed very hard when Happy showed him. They chatted about the earthquake in Tokyo and Tony\u2019s illness, with minor tones of worry. Happy asked about how his physics test went. Small talk to pass the time before they appeared at Stark Tower. Peter asked about the security department, and the people who worked there. Happy very fondly discussed all of his employees, and Peter promised that he\u2019d be around to say hello at some point throughout the day.\nHe started by signing in at the front desk. Peter had fond memories with the people who worked at the front desk. They rotated, of course, but Peter had been to Stark Tower so many times over the years that he knew pretty much all of the people. That day it was Will, who he chatted to for a bit, making sure everything was alright. No grievances, other than people being people. Will directed him into an office on the first floor, where it turned out FRIDAY had delivered his suit so he didn\u2019t have to start the day wearing the casual wear he was wearing. He attached his little Acting CEO badge to the lapel of the suit with a grimace.\u00a0\nAnd then so began the tour. The first several floors were home to the IT department and the Security &amp; Maintenance department. These guys kept the building going, and Peter had only really been down to visit them when he had a question for Happy.\u00a0 That needed correcting, hence his presence.\u00a0\nIn IT, Peter met up with Don, the whiz at all things computer-related. Don taught him all about the computers they used to run the building and all of the operating systems, including the back-up ones in case he ever needed them. Some of the particularly cool features on the computers, which had been created or adapted especially for Stark Industries use, he sent pictures of to Ned. His guy in the chair would be far more invested in the computers than he was. Peter knew enough about code to get by, but he was far more interested in the science element of it all. The area of computers Peter specialised in was all the coding necessary for his suits, the Iron Man suits, robots, and AI systems. Anything beyond that and Peter got somewhat lost. However, it was Ned\u2019s speciality, so Peter knew for certain his best friend would love it. He was right.\n\nNed: DUDE\n\n\nNed: THAT TECH IS SICK!!\u00a0\n\n\nNed: WHERE TF ARE YOU?\n\n\nPeter: Stark Industries IT department\n\n\nPeter: You have to come visit dude it\u2019s so sick you\u2019d love it\n\n\nNed: !!!\n\n\nNed: YoungBoss again?\u00a0\n\n\nNed: That physics test was awful, I can\u2019t believe you finished so early.\u00a0\n\nPeter explained the situation briefly to Ned, who complained a bit about being alone for the rest of the day but wished him good luck. Peter did hate abandoning Ned at school, especially as it meant he would miss out on seeing MJ for the day\u2026well. They were beginning to get close \u2014 platonically, though. It was difficult to get romantically close to someone in a trio friendship. But sometimes she looked at him, and it felt like they were communicating silently. Ever since she became Captain of the Decathlon team, anyways. Maybe that was MJ\u2019s idea of friendship.\u00a0\nHe wandered around with Don, asking him if he ever had any problems with Stark Industries, any employees or anything.\u00a0\n\u201cNah,\u201d Don shook his head, \u201cThe IT team are close. We\u2019ve never had any problems here, everyone is pretty much the same. I know there have been issues in other departments though.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWhere?\u201d Peter asked, determined to pay them a visit. He had the time, after all.\u00a0\n\u201cPublic relations has been fraught with troubles recently. I don\u2019t know quite what happened but ever since the new deputy for their department was hired, there have been more and more problems.\u201d Don explained.\u00a0\n\u201cWell, thank you for your time. I\u2019ll let you get back to work.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt was a pleasure, boss. See you around?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Peter nodded, having a final glance around the department.\u00a0\nWhen he strolled into Security and Maintenance, Happy welcomed him with open arms and introduced him to all of the employees. It turned out these guys were a close bunch as well, and had no problems either. Apparently all of them reported any problems to Happy, and as Happy had the balls to actually speak up to either Tony or Pepper, any issues they had were sorted reasonably quickly. Being the Head of Security with a personal connection to the Big Boss was helpful like that. Happy\u2019s main complaint was that Peter\u2019s badge wasn\u2019t on proper display, as Peter didn\u2019t actually like wearing the blazer all that much. When he could, he would carry the blazer instead of wearing it, leaving him wearing simply a white shirt \u2014 and no badge. Besides, the suit jacket didn\u2019t seem to agree with a badge being pinned onto it. He\u2019d lost three of his \u201cPeter Parker - Intern Director\u201d badges in the last two weeks because of the suits dislodging them somehow. It was like the expensive fabric just rejected the intrusion.\u00a0\nNext he moved on to the floors up a couple of levels, which contained Human Resources and Public Relations. Peter wandered into the Human Resources department and stopped off at people\u2019s various desks, checking up on them. These guys dealt with hiring new employees, interns, and mainly dealing with problems the employees had, especially if they had problems with other employees.\u00a0\n\u201cI wondered,\u201d Peter paused. \u201cWho\u2019s in charge of managing the hires and problems for Public Relations?\u201d\n\u201cOh, um, Kai, I think.\u201d One of the employees pointed him out, and Peter wandered over, glancing at people\u2019s computers and some files on the way. Kai noticed him approaching and stood up from his desk.\u00a0\n\u201cMr Parker,\u201d Kai nodded, holding a hand out for him to shake. Peter had found that the employees who hadn\u2019t met him before often liked to shake his hand. He probably needed to work on giving a stronger handshake. Sign of authority, and whatnot.\n\u201cJust Peter, please. I\u2019ve heard your name is Kai, and you hire all the employees for the Public Relations department?\u201d Peter queried.\n\u201cI do indeed, that\u2019s my role here.\u201d Kai affirmed.\n\u201cHave there been any recent problems with PR recently? I\u2019ve heard whispers.\u201d Peter wasn\u2019t going to rat out his source.\u00a0\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t like to bad-talk any of the employees here, but yes, there has been a recent influx of problems from there, more so than any department.\u201d\u00a0\nPeter fidgeted with his fingers. \u201cWhat is it in reference to, do you know?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWell,\u201d Kai winced. \u201cAbout two months ago, I hired this deputy director, to support Ms Roberts, the head of the PR department. Jayme Andrews. Spotless CV, perfectly lovely attitude. Seemed like a team player. But ever since she arrived, there\u2019s been multiple complaints about her. I don\u2019t quite know why. Any time I send someone up to investigate, they say Jayme is perfectly pleasant.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, thank you. I\u2019ll have to pay them a visit later on.\u201d Peter paused. \u201cDo you have any problems yourself Kai, with anything Stark Industries does?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. Just the problems about PR. Thanks for asking, though.\u201d Kai nodded at him.\u00a0\n\u201cNot a problem. Lovely to meet you.\u201d Peter waved as he walked off, doing a little dance with his feet.\u00a0\nHmm, that whole issue with Jayme sounded like something that needed to be investigated. Peter visited several more employees for HR before encountering the person hiring interns. Stark Industries regularly hired new interns, from all walks of life, but Peter felt they needed to appeal early on, let people know about the scheme. Peter asked the employee what she thought about the idea.\u00a0\n\u201cAn intern fair maybe? Show them what we do.\u201d She posed, tapping her pen on the desk.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re right! That\u2019s actually such a cool idea.\u201d Peter told the employee. \u201cWe could host it here, in one of the halls on the first floor.\u201d They kept several large rooms for press conferences and release dates. \u201cWe could get the interns to demo projects and talk about their experiences here, encourage more applicants. It would be aimed at high schoolers. I know I would have benefitted from doing something like that, I still would if I didn\u2019t work here already. Lots of my classmates would be really interested in something like that\u2014 I go to a science school, you see.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s cool,\u201d The employee mumbled. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll draw up some plans and a date, but we have to run it by the manager.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay!\u201d Peter pointed at his badge. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to check with anyone.\u201d The employee\u2019s eyes widened in shock and she started fidgeting with the pen nervously.\u00a0\n\u201cOh \u2014 Mr Parker! I am so sorry I didn\u2019t recognise you!\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t even worry about it, we haven\u2019t met before, that\u2019s on me. I\u2019m going to talk to your boss now, but this is your project, okay. Yours. Liaison with me when we have more details, yeah? My email is on the system, you\u2019ve got it.\u201d Peter grinned at her.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d She smiled a little bit. Peter nodded his head, and wandered off to go and speak to the manager of HR. Gosh, this was so much more productive that doing random meetings with the board! He was actually solving problems, doing things, learning more about the company! And he was only just getting started! Woah! This felt good. Hopefully Pepper didn\u2019t mind the stuff he was doing\u2026an intern fair was probably something he should get confirmation for, but hell. He was the CEO for the day.\u00a0\nAfter Human Resources, the natural progression of the tour meant he ended up at Public Relations. He was anticipating some drama, not even because of the problems he\u2019d learned about, it was just that whenever he\u2019d met with Ms Roberts, head of the department, he\u2019d been assaulted with the details about his own publicity campaign. There was nothing wrong with having his own publicity campaign \u2014 except that he didn\u2019t have one, or need one. He was just an intern director who was sometimes the CEO, there would be nothing to announce. If Stark Industries announced every employee they hired, they would never stop doing press conferences.\u00a0\nMs Roberts had been very persistent, though. It was for that reason he mainly avoided PR. Tony had confessed to him that he also tended to avoid the PR department, because they constantly wanted to talk about Tony\u2019s media image and covering up stories about his past. Tony said he didn\u2019t care - he\u2019d made mistakes, and he wasn\u2019t planning on hiding them. Peter took much the same attitude \u2014 as long as he could keep Spiderman private, any big mistakes he made as Peter Parker should be public.\u00a0\nBut in order to find out the truth about Ms Roberts\u2019 problem-causing employee Jayme, he had to actually talk to Ms Roberts. So Peter decided to be brave and just knock on her office. Ms Roberts seemed stressed, but she brightened up when she saw Peter.\u00a0\n\u201cMr Parker, lovely to see you!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cAnd you, of course,\u201d Peter nodded. \u201cProblems?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOh, just continued issues. I\u2019m sure you know about the leaks we\u2019ve been having recently.\u201d Peter did. Pepper had been extremely stressed about it two weeks ago. Release dates of products and even details about these projects kept getting released to the media. It was a major problem, but Peter hadn\u2019t seen how he could possibly resolve it unless he interviewed every single employee, and that seemed like a waste of time.\n\u201cDo you have any ideas about the source yet? Any people you need me to interrogate?\u201d Peter was being serious, but Ms Roberts chuckled.\u00a0\n\u201cHow about everyone? There\u2019s too many people to even start limiting it down. Most of the departments handle stages of the projects that keep getting leaked, and employees talk with each other anyways.\u201d\u00a0\nPeter winced. \u201cHow about everyone down here?\u201d\nMs Roberts sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t want to think about it. I prefer to trust my employees, Peter.\u201d\u00a0\nYes, here was a nice segue into the new topic.\u00a0\n\u201cI heard you have a new second in command. How is Miss Andrews?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cRuthless, but that\u2019s good. She doesn\u2019t like to talk to people overly, but she gets her job done and that\u2019s what I need right now.\u201d Okay, Roberts wasn\u2019t going to insult anyone, no matter how brutal Peter got. And he really didn\u2019t want to get interrogative, it was best to keep the heads of departments on his side.\u00a0\n\u201cPerfect, well, I\u2019ll leave you to get on. Best of luck with the\u2026issues.\u201d Ms Roberts turned to him.\u00a0\n\u201cWait, Mr Parker. We need to discuss your public image and your social media prof\u2014\u201d Peter was on the move, and fast.\u00a0\n\u201cSee you soon, Ms Roberts!\u201d He swung out of the office and shut the door behind him.\u00a0\nNow, really, all Peter wanted to do was get the hell out of PR so he wouldn\u2019t have to watch as someone combed through his social media profiles. He wasn\u2019t an idiot, he hardly posted anything on social media, nothing stupid anyways. Anything else he posted was on an anonymous account, very anonymous, without his face. Also, he was logged into the Spiderman social media accounts on his phone and it could all go extremely wrong very quickly if random people from Stark Industries found out about him being Spiderman. It would be a mess with NDAs and far too much paperwork.\nBut he feared he wouldn\u2019t be able to escape Ms Roberts fast enough if he tried to run out of the department now, so he decided to take Kai\u2019s approach and investigate this mystery employee causing complaints, Jayme Andrews. She had her own office, which was right next to Ms Roberts, as the deputy head of the department. He knocked and a voice called for him to let himself in.\u00a0\nPeter entered and caught sight of her for the first time. Jayme was a blonde lady, probably about thirty, extremely pretty in a very \u2018perfect\u2019 way. Make-up done up to perfection, not a hair out of place. She smiled at him, and he relaxed. Okay, maybe Kai had over exaggerated. There was no way she could be that bad. Ms Roberts had been kind about her, at least. He should at least start with a good feeling about the conversation, rather than an immediate sense of impending doom.\u00a0\n\u201cHi,\u201d Peter said, slightly awkward. He didn\u2019t really know how to have this chat. Hey Jayme, I\u2019ve heard you\u2019re a right pain in the ass, might telling me why? Maybe he should have talked to some of the other employees before this. Being warned about someone before you\u2019ve even met them apparently made him extremely uncomfortable.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m Jayme Andrews. You\u2019re Peter Parker.\u201d Peter nodded.\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d Peter could immediately see the iciness that Ms Roberts had been trying to describe when she\u2019d talked about Jayme. The woman was cold.\n\u201cYou\u2019re the intern director everyone talks about all the time.\u201d Peter raised an eyebrow. All the time? \u201cOh, well, I doubt that. I\u2019m just Peter.\u201d He shrugged.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that your badge says? Acting-CEO?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, um, Pepper and Tony can\u2019t be in charge today so I\u2019m here. I step in when they can\u2019t, basically.\u201d Jayme smiled at that. \u201cI\u2019m doing a tour of the building today. I was just wondering, do you..um..have any problems with Stark Industries?\u201d He was kind of messing up all his words, but fuck it.\u00a0\n\u201cNo problems at all,\u201d Jayme said. She had some kind of accent, but he couldn\u2019t place it. That was the kind of things that unreasonably bugged Peter, like he knew unconsciously where it was from but he couldn\u2019t place why.\u00a0\n\u201cSo you\u2019re reasonably settled in, understand your role. I know you\u2019re new to the position, I was wondering if you had any enquiries.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m perfectly comfortable where I am, thank you, Mr Parker.\u201d It was almost a drawl, her tone. Like it was covered with a layer of thick sarcasm or something.\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, great! Well, I\u2019ll leave you to get on, but please do feel free to check in if you need anything.\u201d Okay, that wasn\u2019t so bad. She was a bit cold, not very emotional, not the most pleasant person to be around, but otherwise okay. Maybe people didn\u2019t think she was working well with the team, but that didn\u2019t mean she couldn\u2019t do her job. Peter couldn\u2019t fire her for being antisocial.\u00a0\nSo he left her office, feeling a bit confused, and decided to talk to some of the other employees. He made it to someone\u2019s desk and started a conversation with them when he heard something coming from inside the office he just left. It was a ringtone \u2014 Jayme was calling someone.\u00a0\nPeter didn\u2019t like using his super-hearing for stuff like that, not civilian stuff. It felt fair when it was for Spiderman, but in his actual life it had just made him able to hear a lot of conversations he just wasn\u2019t supposed to hear. He\u2019d heard a lot of insults second-hand, not even said to his face. It felt like an invasion of privacy, especially when he was at work. Confidential business was supposed to remain confidential. But apparently his spidey senses disagreed. Apparently this was important, and he needed to know. If his senses thought something was wrong, it probably was. He\u2019d learned to trust the senses.\nSo Peter excused himself from the conversation he\u2019d just engaged in and retreated to the wall next to Jayme\u2019s office, probably looking extremely weird in the process of doing so.\u00a0\n\u201cMarcus, you\u2019re going to love this,\u201d Jayme\u2019s voice was loud and clear to Peter, even through the wall. Who was Marcus? He glanced around the PR department \u2014 no one had just picked up the phone in the last minute. Someone external then. \u201cI just spoke to Peter Parker. He\u2019s the new CEO of Stark Industries, and get this.\u201d That was simply a lie, Peter was standing in as CEO and he\u2019d made that fairly clear to Jayme.\n\u201cWhat, Alex?\u201d Came the faint voice from the phone. It was faint, but Peter knew he\u2019d heard the words correctly. Peter felt a shiver go down his spine. Jayme, who apparently wasn\u2019t Jayme, but in fact Alex, began to explain her interaction with Peter.\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s like 16, Marcus. This is Stark\u2019s kid, I don\u2019t care if he has some other surname, it\u2019s a joke. That kid is the new CEO and he\u2019s learning the ropes as we speak. They trust him with the company when they\u2019re away \u2014 he\u2019s their kid.\u201d Peter bit his lip. This situation was shady, at best. Who was Marcus?\n\u201cStark and Potts haven\u2019t been together that long.\u201d Marcus was right. Jayme\u2019s theory made absolutely zero sense, there was no way Peter could be Tony\u2019s kid, and what was the point of lying?\n\u201cNo \u2014 I know, Marcus. The details don\u2019t matter. We know Stark slept around, this is what we need to take him down. He had an illegitimate child who he probably abandoned for years, and then kept secret. Now he\u2019s training this kid to take his place as CEO.\u201d Peter clenched his jaw, half a mind to smash through the door and throttle her for insulting Tony. That was not what happened, not at all. Peter wasn\u2019t even his kid!\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand how this will help.\u201d Marcus, the voice of reason, clearly.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019ll paint Tony as the guy who abandoned his son, and a guy who keeps secrets. How can we, the US public, and the government, trust a man like this with a suit like Iron Man, with protecting the world, if he couldn\u2019t even protect his own son.\u201d Okay, so they clearly have some kind of personal vendetta against Tony, and they were planning on exposing him somehow. That\u2019s a legitimate problem. Peter grabbed his phone out of his pocket and texted Happy.\u00a0\n\nPeter: Think I\u2019m going to need your help in a minute\n\n\nHappy: Where?\u00a0\n\n\nPeter: Public Relations\n\n\nHappy: Please don\u2019t make me go there\n\n\nPeter: Important. Come. Quick.\u00a0\n\n\nHappy: I\u2019ll be there in five minutes. Keep me posted.\u00a0\n\n\u201cAlex, you\u2019re a genius. Write the story and we\u2019ll have it published for Monday\u2019s paper. A little bit of research on this kid and we can make it perfect.\u201d Okay, Marcus was no longer the voice of reason. Seriously? He heard a story littered with lies and immediately decided to doxx a child. Wow, Marcus. Wow.\u00a0\n\u201cMarcus, can I come back to The Daily Media now?\u201d Shit, so Jayme\u2019s work at Stark was all just to find something to expose Tony with? Had she also been the source of the leaks\u2014 it would make sense, and the timeline would fit? The leaks about the products had started a couple of months ago.\u00a0\n\u201cOf course, Alex. Hand in your notice. Your work at Stark Industries is done.\u201d The call ended, and Peter gave it ten seconds before he opened the door, closing it behind him. He wanted to do this subtly. Jayme\u2014 Alex, rather, turned to stare at him with alarmed eyes, then settled her jaw.\u00a0\n\u201cSo.\u201d Alex said. \u201cHow much of that did you hear?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cAlex,\u201d Peter held out his hands, a peaceful move. \u201cI know who you are now, and let\u2019s just talk about this.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is there to talk about? I\u2019ve got everything I need, anyways. I don\u2019t need to stay here any longer.\u201d Alex paced behind her desk.\u00a0\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t do this. It won\u2019t hurt the company as much as you think. It won\u2019t even hurt Tony. He\u2019s had many people bash at his reputation. I have lawyers that can prove that everything you just said to \u2014 who was it? Marcus, are not true. We will sue you and the Daily Media for defamation of character.\u201d It was true: the Stark legal team had drafted a lot of lawsuits on Tony\u2019s behalf, and they wouldn\u2019t hesitate to do another one.\u00a0\n\u201cThe story\u2019s getting out, Peter. I can give them a nice article about your little job, and you playing as CEO every so often, when your parents have emergencies. Tony Stark treats you like family. I think the media would very much appreciate someone giving them a tell-all about the Stark child.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYou have to know, I\u2019m not actually his son.\u201d Peter established.\u00a0\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Alex shrugged. \u201cYou look alike. You act alike. We\u2019ll make proof, and they\u2019ll believe me anyways. People believe anything they read. I can see it now \u2014 expos\u00e9 on Tony Stark and his appalling attempt at being a parent.\u201d Okay, she fucked up. Peter wouldn\u2019t stand for someone insulting Tony\u2019s parenting skills, no way. Not with how amazingly Tony had treated him over the past couple of years.\u00a0\n\u201cTony Stark would be a great father. I don\u2019t know why you hate him so much, but I assure you,\u00a0 you don\u2019t have to do this, you know. We can talk, arrange something. A deal. It doesn\u2019t have to get ugly. I really don\u2019t want to make a lawsuit for this. Please, Alex.\u201d He really would prefer to just sort it out, get to the root of the issue. The last thing he wanted was to spend hours sitting in a room talking to lawyers.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s too late, Peter. I\u2019m never going to side with Tony Stark or his company.\u201d He was fed up. Alex was clearly not going to explain any of her motives.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m doing this quietly because I didn\u2019t want to confront you in front of all your colleagues, and I think we should keep this on the down-low, but you will be punished for this, I promise you\u2014\u201d Peter hissed at her, but was interrupted.\n\u201cNo, I won\u2019t be. You\u2019re going to let me walk out of this door.\u201d That startled him, but he\u2019d take the bait.\n\u201cOh? And why\u2019s that?\u201d\u00a0\nAlex pulled out a gun, aimed at Peter\u2019s head. Well, he\u2019s had enough guns pointed at his head that his heart doesn\u2019t really race anymore, but still. It was the whole principle of the matter. A little extreme, he thought, to pull a gun for this.\n\u201cA gun?\u201d Peter said drily. \u201cOh no! I\u2019m so scared!\u201d \u00a0\nPeter shot webs at her gun and it stuck to the wall. He kept the web-shooters on at all times, hidden even under his business suit. And good thing he did, too. You never did know when you would need some webs. He was pretty sure that the office doors weren\u2019t bulletproof, no matter how Stark Tower was built, there was no way they had budget for bulletproof doors. Someone could have been seriously injured \u2014 he could have been seriously injured! If he had gotten shot, Tony actually would have had a heart attack. Besides, then who would be left to run Stark Industries? Pepper in Japan, Tony bed-ridden and Peter shot? No, it had been best to de-arm her as quick as possible.\n\u201cWha\u2014 how do you have those?\u201d Alex seemed too stunned to actually worry about the gun having been taken from her. Probably still scooping for another story.\u00a0\n\u201cA little gift from Spiderman. I make all his tech and webs for him, you see. So he keeps me equipped.\u201d Peter doesn\u2019t like to lie, but hey. He can\u2019t have this woman going around telling everyone he\u2019s Spiderman. It was dangerous to even use the webs, exposing himself like that. It isn\u2019t too unreliable that he would know Spiderman, so at least that is a solid link. After all, it had been widely established that Spiderman knew Tony, from the missions they\u2019d been on together, and the times Spiderman had been sighted climbing the walls of Stark Tower. Peter works for Tony, obviously. It wasn\u2019t too far a stretch.\u00a0\nPeter webbed Alex to the wall, too, and turned to the door, opening it. Happy, rather conveniently, was standing in the doorway. He assessed the situation extremely quickly.\n\u201cWhat is going on here?\u201d Happy was horrified. He turned to Peter and whispered, \u201cPeter, tell me that isn\u2019t a person and a gun stuck to the wall with webs.\u201d Rather unfortunately, the entire Public Relations team were crowding around as well, and could quite easily see into the office.\n\u201cIt is a gun. This is Alex,\u201d Peter gestured to Alex, like he was leading an auction, \u201cwho Stark Industries knows as Jayme Andrews. She just tried to shoot me in the head, and she\u2019s actually a journalist who works for a newspaper called the Daily Media. She\u2019s been working here for two months to try and expose Stark Industries and Tony in particular. Her boss has just decided to do an expos\u00e9 on Tony and me.\u201d Happy looked like he wanted to kill someone, preferably Alex.\u00a0\n\u201cRight,\u201d Happy said, nodding, as though he couldn\u2019t process it but was accepting it anyways. \u201cAnd you just found this out. Because of course you did.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHappy.\u201d Peter gestured at the woman, whispering. \u201cI think she needs an escort to um\u2026the police station.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYes. Right. I can do that.\u201d Happy unstuck her from the wall, restraining her with another of his employees down in security. Before they took her out of the Public Relations department, for good, Peter pulled the Head of Security aside.\u00a0\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t tell Tony about this,\u201d the last thing Peter wanted to do was cause extra stress for his boss. But that wasn\u2019t the only issue \u2014 Happy had been dating his Aunt May for several months now, so he had to cover that off. \u201cAnd May. Don\u2019t tell May. I\u2019ll tell her, but she\u2019ll freak out if she hears it from you.\u201d\u00a0\nHappy frowned. It was probably the opposite of his job description, hiding information like this. He\u2019d been Tony\u2019s bodyguard for years, so it went against his instincts to not tell the man of any possible threat, even if Tony wouldn\u2019t take it seriously if the threat was against himself. But if Tony found out that he\u2019d nearly been killed, it would be bad for his illness, and bad for the YoungBoss protocol, which would probably be suspended until further notice. He wanted to avoid that at all costs. \u00a0\n\u201cPlease, Happy. Tony\u2019s ill,\u201d Peter pleaded, and it worked.\u00a0\nHappy nodded with a resigned expression, clearly unhappy. \u201cFine. But you better tell them. Both of them.\u201d\u00a0\nPeter let out a breath. That was one problem sorted \u2014 Happy wouldn\u2019t tell. But it did mean that he had to tell them, and that always went well. After the one time he\u2019d been stabbed (lightly) as Spiderman on one patrol evening, Tony had Karen report any injuries, however minor. Tony would send him a text, literally about the smallest bruise Peter had ever received, often after it had already healed. Jeez, it was like the man forgot he had advanced healing as part of his powers.\u00a0\nThat stabbing incident had made Tony become much more cautious with Peter, adding at least a dozen new protective protocols to the suit every time he saw them. He didn\u2019t want that to happen again. Peter decided not to tell Tony about this until it had been sorted. He didn\u2019t want to hear the wrath of Tony when he found out that Peter had approached a dangerous situation without his suit, with no back-up. It would be decidedly not good.\u00a0\nHe watched as Happy walked out of PR with Alex. They should probably call the police, but them turning up at Stark Tower would cause unnecessary publicity, the very thing he was trying to avoid when he was acting as CEO. No, this was the discreet method. He\u2019d probably have to talk to them at some point, explain the whole story, but for the mean time he\u2019d just get FRIDAY to send the video and audio footage of the whole interaction and that would probably sort it.\u00a0\nIn the mean time, Marcus would be busy starting to write the story and do research into him, which had to stop. He and the legal team would have to get together and write them a serious letter, explaining the consequences of their actions. What was better, to let them do a story on him, and then get more money and properly sue the company, or get the legal team to shut it down before the story was released? What would be better for Stark Industries? Obviously it would be slander, and defamation of character to release a series of articles about Tony like that, especially considering it was based on lies. Peter wasn\u2019t Tony\u2019s biological son, so that was a flaw for the Daily Media in any case, and as well as that, Peter was only officially Intern Director. Pepper was still CEO. YoungBoss was in place for emergencies.\u00a0\nWell, anyways, he could get into all that with the legal team. They knew better about all of that stuff, anyways. And he\u2019d definitely have to give Kai a bonus for tipping him off to that one. If he hadn\u2019t told Peter all about the problems up in PR, they wouldn\u2019t have known who the leaks were coming from for forever. Alex probably could have stayed as Jayme for a good while longer before leaving with her big \u2018tell-all\u2019 story.\u00a0\nPeter called the police and got an officer who was a friend of Spiderman to go and pretty much spy on Marcus for a bit. Officer Stacy was only too happy to help. Obviously, Marcus couldn\u2019t be arrested for planning to do an expos\u00e9 on Tony. Defamation wasn\u2019t a criminal offence, more of a civil one. He would need to do some research into Marcus and Alex, as well, before the legal team started on whatever actions they decided they would take. This whole scenario probably wasn\u2019t the first time they\u2019d done something nefarious \u2014 it certainly hadn\u2019t sounded like that, in any case.\u00a0\nAlex could be arrested, through, for attempted murder of Peter, at least that\u2019s what Officer Stacy said. Which kind of sucked, because Peter didn\u2019t like ruining people\u2019s lives, but she was clearly not a great person, so she probably deserved to be behind bars.\u00a0\nHe made a mental note to get FRIDAY to send the files down to the station, and also send a copy to the legal team. Wow, this was going to give him a serious headache.\u00a0\nWhen he got off the phone with Officer Stacy, he turned back to the employees of Public Relations, king of having forgotten that he wasn\u2019t alone. They were all staring at him with their eyes wide and mouths gaping. Okay, so, it hadn\u2019t exactly been a normal day, but hey! He couldn\u2019t help it if one of the senior employees of their department was actually a member of a secret plot to ruin Tony\u2019s life. That\u2019s kind of like, a normal day for Spiderman, but it probably shouldn\u2019t be for Peter Parker.\u00a0\nHe should probably be freaking out right now. The employees are currently seeing a 17-year old kid who nearly got killed react perfectly calmly to the situation, and who is also their boss. He could understand the weirdness. Also, he\u2019d interrupted their day. He looked up at them all and winced.\u00a0\n\u201cSorry? I think you might have to get a new deputy?\u201d He glanced at Ms Roberts, whose face had contorted into something he couldn\u2019t quite describe, a mixture of confusion, worry and extreme concern. \u201cI\u2019ll\u2026um, leave. Please leave Jayme\u2019s office alone, a policeman might have to look at it. If there\u2019s any problems\u2026um, let me know. Sorry again.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cMr Parker. That was incredible.\u201d One of the employees clearly managed to break through the sheer shock of the whole situation, and the rest of the employees nod along with him. Several of them started clapping, which set off the others. Soon the entire room was filled with clapping noises. Even Ms Roberts was clapping.\u00a0\nPeter winced again, the loud noise hurting his ears, \u201cNo, really, it\u2019s nothing. I, uh, gotta go.\u201d\u00a0\nWow. Okay, he hadn\u2019t planned on bringing Spiderman into Stark Industries today, but apparently his Parker luck followed him everywhere, even work. Hopefully nothing like that would happen for the rest of the day\u2026or ever. \u00a0\nHis phone buzzed. Shit, Tony. He was calling. Okay, Peter had to act normal. He couldn\u2019t stress Tony out by telling him. Okay. Peter breathed out. Operation Don\u2019t Tell Tony was a go. \u201cHey, Mr Stark.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHey kid. I just wanted to,\u201d Tony paused to cough, \u201ccheck in with you, see how your day\u2019s going!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s all good, thank you. I\u2019m doing a tour of the building and going to check up on the Marketing department now! How are you doing?\u201d Peter wasn\u2019t really lying, just avoiding the truth. That was something teenagers did, right? Avoid the truth\u2026\n\u201cOh, that sounds great. I\u2019m stuck in a bed, wasting away. My genius is flowing away from me as we speak,\u201d Tony dramatised, before turning real. \u201cBut seriously, kid, I\u2019m bored. Give me something, anything, I can do for you. To make your day easier.\u201d Peter scanned through the list of things he\u2019d done already today. Honestly, he probably had it all sorted. There wasn\u2019t anything Tony could do, and if Peter told him about the Incident with Alex, he would probably storm straight down to the Daily Media Headquarters to kick up a fuss with Marcus. Peter didn\u2019t want that: it would only stress him out, and he didn\u2019t need that when he was ill, and even worse, it would make Pepper angry. And no one wanted to see Pepper went she was angry.\u00a0\n\u201cMr Stark, Pepper is right. You need to rest, that\u2019s the only thing that will make you better. If I get time this evening I\u2019ll swing by and we can chat about science and Mark 64, but for now you need to stay there and do nothing.\u201d He didn\u2019t think he could actually speak to Tony face to face, because the man was able to tell when he was lying. Pretty much everyone could tell when he was lying, to be honest. He didn\u2019t have the best poker face. Peter would probably just claim he was tired to avoid it.\u00a0\n\u201cBut Pete that\u2019s so boring!\u201d Peter smiled, just a little.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll get someone to drop off a repulsor if you want, but I\u2019m not sure the security will pass it through.\u201d At leats then Tony could fiddle with something, even if it was trivial.\u00a0\n\u201cNah, it\u2019s okay, kid. I\u2019ll speak to you later, yeah?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Peter regretted saying he would hang out with Mr Stark. He loved Tony, of course. But being around the man after he\u2019d been cooped up in a hospital bed for two days was not a course of action he wanted to take. \u201cI might be too tired. And I think New York needs their friendly neighbourhood hero back for a bit.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cPete, if you\u2019re exhausted, then don\u2019t overwork yourself. I think May and I would both prefer if you got some rest before Spidermanning.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cTony, I\u2019m actually fine. Genuinely, fine. Just wondering how I will be after the afternoon.\u201d Peter felt okay, but he never was good at estimating his own wellbeing.\u00a0\n\u201cSpeaking of your wellness, Lisa told me you forgot to have lunch last time. I know I do it a lot, but that\u2019s no excuse for you to follow my lead. Have you had lunch today?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cShit, I forgot.\u201d Peter swore. How did he always forget to have lunch? May would kill him.\u00a0\n\u201cGo and get your sandwich, kiddo. If I don\u2019t see you today, it will be tomorrow, yeah? Pepper said she might not be able to be taking calls and be online in time for tomorrow, so I\u2019ll be back in business, we both agreed-\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Peter interjected. \u201cTony, I\u2019ll do it. Honestly. I\u2019m on a roll today, getting lots of stuff done that I won\u2019t be able to finish all in one day. Don\u2019t stress yourself out.\u201d Okay, so he was looking out for his mentor\u2019s wellness, but it was also slightly selfish. It would be poor practise to start a bunch of projects and then leave them to his colleague to finish.\u00a0\n\u201cOh,\u201d Tony sounded surprised, probably because Peter had never been that enthusiastic about being step-in CEO. \u201cWell, I look forward to hearing about what you\u2019re up to when I see you next!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cRest!\u201d Peter said sternly, then hung up.\u00a0\nStark Industries\u2019 cafeteria was pretty much empty when he arrived. It was two o\u2019clock again (how did this always happen when he was working, forgetting to eat lunch? God, it made him grateful for the school routine he was used to) and he wanted his sandwich. Mr Delmar\u2019s son made it for him with a smile \u2014 this time a chicken sandwich in a French baguette with a variety of salad vegetables and some barbecue sauce. There was nothing Peter liked more than barbecue sauce on his sandwiches\u2026and most foods.\nHe cast his eyes over the cafeteria. There was one table of a couple of employees, and then a woman sat on the other side of the room by herself, working on a computer. The group of interns waved him over to sit with them, Jasper included. Peter went over and made some small talk, explaining how his day had been so far (leaving out the attempted murder). They chatted a bit about their projects, and Peter found his eyes drifting to the other side of the room.\u00a0\nHe saw the lone employee now had her head in her hands, seemingly deeply frustrated if not upset. Peter immediately abandoned his sandwich on the table, trying not to think about how much bacteria was probably collected there from all of the Stark employees eating. He crossed the room to the lone employee, whose name badge read, \u201cMary - Marketing and Finance\u201d. Their paths had never crossed.\u00a0\n\u201cHey, hey, it\u2019s okay!\u201d Peter reassured, tapping the employee on the shoulder. She looked up at him, a cacophony of tears.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m okay, I don\u2019t need,\u201d She sniffed, \u201cI don\u2019t need help, I\u2019m okay.\u201d\nPeter sat down. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not. What\u2019s bothering you?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to bother you with my problems.\u201d Oh, wow, defensive. Clearly doesn\u2019t like talking about her problems but is absolutely going through something.\u00a0\n\u201cYou do, actually. I\u2019m doing this tour of the building, seeing if anyone has any problems with working here.\u201d Peter explained. \u201cI haven\u2019t, um, visited Marketing and Finance yet, so that might be why you haven\u2019t seen me. I\u2019m the CEO for today, Pepper and Tony are busy, so, I thought I\u2019d use my time to do something worthwhile. What\u2019s your issue, is it to do with work?\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not work related, it\u2019s, um, personal. I just,\u201d Mary paused, tears still rolling down her face. \u201cI think I just need to talk to someone. I have a lot going on right now.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWell, you can always talk to me, but if you mean you\u2019d prefer to talk to someone professional, I\u2019m friends with a great therapist who could put you in contact with some of his colleagues.\u201d Peter mentally told himself to text Sam about getting Mary a therapist. Wow, his mental list was getting longer and longer. Hire Ned to work in the IT department, arrange a fair for future intern prospects, sort out the PR issue, send all of the PR employees gift baskets of chocolate so they aren\u2019t traumatised, get this employee a therapist, etc etc.\u00a0\n\u201cEven with the insurance I get from here, I don\u2019t think that would cover a private therapist and I\u2019m very grateful for it, Mr Stark\u2014\u201d It still took Peter by surprise, even though he knew lots of people thought he and Tony were related. He was still trying to wrap his head around literal Captain America thinking he was Tony\u2019s son. He was probably blushing \u2014 it always made him really embarrassed, when he was compared to Mr Stark.\u00a0\nHe went to correct her. \u201cOh, I\u2019m\u2026I\u2019m not a Stark, Mary.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOh! I apologise, sorry. I just assumed you were related to Tony Stark. With you, um, being in charge and all. I thought it might be someone they were related to. And you guys seem, um, quite similar. Apologies.\u201d She seemed sheepish with the admission.\u00a0\n\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s okay, I don\u2019t mind. I\u2019m Peter Parker. But just call me Peter, really. But please go on with what you were saying.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cStark Industries gives an amazing employee medical package, of course, but the price for anything to do with mental health is insanity. My brother tried to get help from the system and he was put on a waitlist for six months. It\u2019s awful.\u201d Peter thought it through. He knew the American healthcare system was absolutely shit, and he\u2019d known that Stark employees got a pretty good employee package, but he\u2019d never been in the position of struggling with health issues. May was pretty healthy, and Ben had been too, due to good lifestyle and diet. Peter of course had the advanced healing, and anytime he had been injured, he just came to Stark Tower. Their medical facilities understood his fast healing rate, and he got quick and necessary medical care. Obviously, he couldn\u2019t open up the Avengers medroom to the public, not even his favourite employees. But there must be something he could do to support Mary. And then an idea formed.\u00a0\n\u201cMary, I do believe I\u2019ve just had a brainwave. Do you think, if Stark Industries hired a private therapist to come and talk to employees, free of charge, that would help?\u201d Surely it would \u2014 giving employees a space to talk to someone external, someone free. \u00a0\n\u201cAbsolutely. I know I\u2019m struggling, so there must be others here who are as well. A lot of the employees are college graduates, Peter. I can tell you for certain that a lot of people are facing difficult times. Even an hour with a therapist would be more than helpful.\u201d\u00a0\nPeter had another thought \u201cAnd if there was a room you could go, not only to talk to a therapist, but just like\u2026a comfort room, full of sofas and comforting things to do, to take their mind off things if it all gets too much\u2026would that help too, do you think? When I\u2019m going through a hard time, sometimes I would prefer to be left alone and just do something to take my mind off things instead of talking through it.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOf course. That would be\u2026incredible. Do you think it will happen?\u201d Mary asked.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to get started with it as soon as possible. Thank you, Mary. This has been\u2026most enlightening. If you need anything at all, drop me an email, okay. It\u2019s on the system - [email\u00a0protected]. I\u2019ll respond as soon as I can.\u201d\u201cThank you for stopping to check on me. Most people would just walk past and go on with their day.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s no problem.\u201d Peter meant it. That was the whole point of his day \u2014 to solve problems. This was a problem he could solve, and he\u2019d thought of an apt solution.\u00a0\n\u201cI can see why they chose you.\u201d Mary smiled. \u201cMiss Potts, and Mr Stark. You might be young but you\u2019re probably the smartest person here, and I\u2019m not talking about your projects.\u201d\u00a0\nPeter smiled and scratched the back of his neck. \u201cI\u2019ll see you around!\u201d He never could handle compliments. After that whole conversation, he\u2019d pretty much wasted the time he had allotted for his lunch break. But he ran back over to the intern table to grab what was left of his sandwich. Time to get back to work.\u00a0\nHe jumped onto the elevator to go up to Marketing and Finance, hoping to move on from the incident in PR. Hopefully it would be kept quiet and the PR team would have kept it to themselves. The interns at the table hadn\u2019t known after all.\u00a0\nHe was wrong. When Peter arrived at Marketing and Finance, everyone turned to stare at him with awe and concern. Shit. They knew. Somehow, they knew already. Of course, it could just be they were collectively in awe that the boss had come to see them \u2014 Peter had never even stepped foot in Marketing and Finance. He\u2019d been in meetings with some of the team, but they\u2019d been in meeting rooms at the top of the Tower. But their faces\u2026something was definitely up.\u00a0\n\u201cOh, hi guys. I\u2019m just doing a tour of the building today, just here to check everything out.\u201d Some of the team nodded, and lots of small communal meetings, probably people tailing off their lunch break, scattered back to their desks. Oh, Peter thought. They think I\u2019m telling them off for not working. He scratched the back of his neck, and wandered around. The room had gone quiet, everyone furiously typing. Peter felt bad. He hadn\u2019t wanted to intimidate, really. He wondered whether this had been the same for the other departments when he\u2019d gone in \u2014 had he been unwelcome? Had he made them feel uncomfortable, unproductive? He hoped not.\u00a0\nHe approached one of the individuals. \u201cMr Parker,\u201d the man pushed his glasses up his nosebridge. \u201cHow are you?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI am alright thank you, how about you? How are you doing\u2026\u201d Peter glanced at his name badge, \u201cLucas.\u201d\u00a0\nLucas\u2019 voice raised by an octave. \u201cOh, okay, um, thank you. We um\u2026we heard about the incident.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cAh. Of course. I should have known things would travel fast in a Tower this big. Well, as long as there\u2019s no one else ready to pull a gun on me, then we\u2019re all fine.\u201d Peter chuckled. Lucas gave a nervous chuckle.\u00a0\n\u201cHow is the marketing department doing, now, Lucas?\u201d Peter said, balancing on Lucas\u2019 desk. He scanned the desk, seeing several files open and also a Rubik\u2019s cube that was unsolved. \u201cDo you mind if I\u2014\u201d Peter gestured to the cube. Lucas nodded for him to take it. Unsolved Rubik\u2019s cubes drove him crazy: he felt a compulsive need to solve them. Peter fiddled for about thirty seconds and then placed it back on the desk, solved. Lucas stared at him.\u00a0\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m not\u2026.you probably don\u2019t want to ask me about the department. I\u2019m just one of the team, not a higher up. Um\u2026Mark is in there.\u201d Lucas pointed to the office down the end of the floor, reading \u2018Head of Marketing Department: Marcus Russell\u2019.\u00a0\nAh yes, Mark. The head of the department. When Pepper had informed him that the new head of the Marketing department was called Mark, Peter had had to hold back a grin. Apparently Tony had laughed his face off, having to actually lean on a wall to recover. Mark. Marketing. Pepper had not been so amused.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll talk to him later, but I prefer to get a more honest description. I\u2019ve found higher ups\u2026problematic at that. I\u2019m sure you can understand that they want to impress me and then go on with their day. You look the kind of guy to tell the truth.\u201d Peter chuckled.\u00a0\n\u201cMr Parker, if I may.\u201d Lucas handed Peter the file on the household robot that Peter was struggling to produce as a result of the tricky equation he\u2019d scribbled earlier that morning on his physics test. \u201cWe think it needs\u2026.a name. To make the bot seem, more human. I know it\u2019s a work in progress and they\u2019re having trouble with it, but they\u2014you\u2014 often have quick breakthroughs, so we like to get the campaign ready for products early, for when it gets released. That way we\u2019re on top of things. And the way other companies market robots like these, well. They like to have names.\u201d\u00a0\nPeter was surprised he hadn\u2019t thought of it himself. It had, in fact, been Tony\u2019s idea to produce a robot for household use, and Tony had showcased several of his bots for the interns to see, to use as inspiration but not for copying. DummE had not appreciated being removed from the lab, although he did like the extra attention as the interns marvelled at Tony\u2019s favourite mechanical companion. They hadn\u2019t been told the names, of course \u2014 that was something Tony kept private.\u00a0\nIt was quintessentially Tony to name his mechanical creations. Peter thought about the bots in the lab, now numerous and all equally unhelpful as Dumme-E, but so endearing. He clearly had a thing about names \u2014 anything Tony made he slapped a name on it, even if it had only the most basic of functions. His AIs too, they all had names: Jarvis, FRIDAY, Karen. When Peter had made some drones for Spiderman, just little spider shaped ones, Tony had insisted he named them. It made him smile just to think about how personal the lab was, and how only a close circle of people knew just how attached Tony could get to things.\nYeah, Tony would like the bots to have names.\n\u201cYeah\u2026.\u201d Peter nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s a good idea. I presume you and your team have compiled some suggestions?\u201d\u00a0\nLucas passed him one of the sheets from the file. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to use any of them, we were just spitballing.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cRight,\u201d Peter scanned the list, not planning on making a decision. \u201cIf it\u2019s okay, I think I\u2019ll take this up to the interns, let them have a think. They\u2019re all getting quite attached to the bot, after spending all that time with him.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cPerfect. Get Isaac to let me know.\u201d Isaac was the guy in charge of the bot production, who had requested Peter\u2019s help for the equation after it had stumped the whole team. Peter had chosen Isaac for the project because Isaac was cool, and had the same personal love that Tony had for bots like these. Isaac probably already had a name for the bot - it wouldn\u2019t be fair for Peter to just choose one without at least consulting him.\u00a0\nPeter left Lucas, then, and went to check on Mark (Mark from Marketing), who had nothing except glowing reports to give to him. Several of the employees thanked and congratulated him on finding such a dangerous employee hidden among the ranks of Public Relations (who of course worked closely with the Marketing and Finance team), which, personally, Peter thought was a little odd, but hey, he didn\u2019t have a conception of what was normal and what was dangerous anymore, not after swinging around as Spiderman for the last several years.\u00a0\nAfter Marketing, the sun had started to set and the working day came to an end, so he went back up to his office mainly filled with junk. His eyes glanced over the array of suits, and of course, the several back up Spiderman suits he keeps locked in a cupboard (just in case). There were drawers full of web fluid in here, all sorts of varieties. It was best to keep them in the office rather than in Tony\u2019s lab, which tended to get exploded quite regularly. At least if he kept them in his office he actually still had a supply of web fluid rather than having to replace it all whenever the lab blew up.\u00a0\nHe sat at the desk, and asked FRIDAY to put him on Do Not Disturb. Peter had the entirety of tomorrow to get all of the things he had promised various employees to be done. So it was time to review the day.\nOkay, hmm. Intern fair. Make sure Jayme Andrews is taken off the Stark Industries register. Follow up with the police and with his legal team about that whole situation. The comfort room - find a location, and a therapist willing to take the job. Find what a normal therapist\u2019s annual wage is and double it \u2014 the Stark way of doing things.\u00a0\nAnd, of course, if he had time, complete the tour. He\u2019d ticked IT, Security and Maintenance, HR, PR and Marketing and Finance off the list. That left the Legal department, Research and Development, and of course Assembly and Production. He should also probably call into the London and Hong Kong branches, ensure everything was running smoothly with all of the heads there.\u00a0\nWith all that in mind, and FRIDAY there to help, Peter began to plan his day. It took some work, and some rearranging of plans, as well as shortening his lunch break significantly, but if he did a full day\u2019s shift, he could get pretty much everything he needed to done.\u00a0\nPeter did a bit more work, including what was quite an important phone call, and then extracted himself from the office. He made the executive decision to stay the night at the Tower, and informed May that he wouldn\u2019t be home. Then he cooked himself some pasta (and almost burnt himself on the stovetop, somehow).\u00a0\nHe thought about sending Tony a text, but he knew that would mean the man would just call him, and he didn\u2019t want to talk to the genius. It would only be extending the lies, and Peter had said that if he was tired, then he wouldn\u2019t come and visit. It had been a maybe at best, anyways.\u00a0\nBut Peter wasn\u2019t tired. He\u2019d settled down for a quiet evening in, and had been tossing and turning for about half an hour before he decided it wasn\u2019t cutting it. Sometimes, he needed the rush of adrenaline that a late night as Spiderman brought him, in order so he could crash later on. And hell, it was a bad idea. FRIDAY and him had calculated how early he\u2019d need to wake up, but he just couldn\u2019t sleep. His mind just kept going back to swarming ideas of Tony being disappointed in him for not doing enough with the time he\u2019d had as CEO. He knew Pepper probably would have been more productive \u2014 meetings with clients. Peter could have arranged calls with the UN, the government, or talked about the recent partnership with PYM Tech for some of their projects, but he hadn\u2019t wanted to. He\u2019d done what he\u2019d wanted, and spending time mulling it over in bed wasn\u2019t working well. He was going to start second guessing all of his decisions.\u00a0\nThere were many buildings that were his favourites to swing off, but Stark Tower had to be one of the best ones. The adrenaline as he swung without knowing exactly where the web would land \u2014 that split second of danger, was worth the dizzy feeling he got from being up so high.\u00a0\nPeter spent four hours swinging in New York \u2014 helping the little guy. He\u2019d actually managed to take care of a situation he\u2019d been eyeing for weeks \u2014 a crime family, the Romanos, who were part of the mob. They\u2019d been in hiding ever since he gave them a scare a couple of weeks ago, but Peter had taken a week off of his nightly patrols to see if that encouraged them to return to the streets, Sure enough, his trackers on the family went dinging and Karen notified him, about an hour into his trip. Peter webbed them to a wall, and avoided getting shot for the second time that evening. It felt easier when he was in the suit, for some reason. Then he left the rest to the police, with a note in his scrawled handwriting saying,\u00a0\n\nMob guys. FBI has a case on them.\n\n\nAsk for Mr Marin when you contact them, he\u2019s in charge of it\u00a0\n\n\n- Spiderman\n\nPeter had, after all, been keeping an eye on it, it hadn\u2019t taken much to find out who the FBI operative had been that had been watching them the same way he had been for weeks. The FBI website had been one of the easiest that he and Ned had cracked into, but that was a story for another time. \u00a0\nHe also stopped a mugging and even helped a couple of cats down from trees! But the best part of his trip had to be when one of the cats he\u2019d saved snuggled into his lap as he sat on a branch. Someone even got a photo of it and put it on Twitter, which he forwarded to Ned and MJ when he was crawling into bed.\nHell, it had been a hectic day. When he\u2019d arrived at the Tower, he\u2019d assumed it would be a chilled day, checking up on all of the departments, not unmasking a corrupt employee and deciding to build a new room. But he\u2019d enjoyed it, more so than he\u2019d thought, even though most people would consider it to be pretty awful and traumatising. Ignoring that whole incident, he\u2019d thought he\u2019d made a lot of progress. Tomorrow, he could get cracking on the new ideas he\u2019d had for the company.\u00a0\nIn the morning, Peter wanted to die. It was too early, and okay, maybe that was his fault for staying up and fighting a crime family into the early hours of the morning. But 6 am was just too early for anyone to possibly get up. None of the employees were at the Tower yet, so he sent a couple of quick emails fixing loose ends he\u2019d forgotten about (from his role as Intern Director rather than CEO), not expecting any responses for a good several hours.\u00a0\nHe also sent Eva a note asking her to write him another letter to excuse him from attending school again, addressed to the Principal of Midtown. He\u2019d winced. He hated getting other people to do stuff for him, and also, his Principal would definitely kick up a fuss for it. Principal Morita had never believed him about the Stark Internship, even when Peter had turned up to his office with the full paperwork showing he was a proper intern (which he hadn\u2019t been, but he\u2019d needed to say something, and saying Tony Stark\u2019s personal intern probably wasn\u2019t going to improve his credibility). Principal Morita had this big thing about only parents or Guardians being able to sign off on an absence. Well, hell, he hadn\u2019t seen May since the day before, and Mr Stark was out of action \u2014 Peter didn\u2019t want to bother him with something so trivial as signing a slip when he was as ill as he was. It seemed stupid. Hopefully Principal Morita would forget about it and accept the letter from Eva, extenuating circumstances and all.\nHe and FRIDAY had concluded that most employees arrived at the Tower at eight to nine am, so he was pretty much free from six to eight. That gave him two hours of free time, in which he had a plan. Peter was going to work on the comfort room, and get it as ready as he possibly could.\nFRIDAY had scanned the Tower for him and found a room that was not being used, was fairly large, and had an adjacent empty office. That was his plan for the comfort room: construction work and then making it look cool. Now, Peter didn\u2019t know much about restoration, but he was fairly strong and had the blueprints to the building. There were no steel beams that would collapse if he just\u2026.broke through the wall. It wasn\u2019t the best of plans, but hey. He had to start somewhere, and this comfort room was his project. \u00a0\nAfter he\u2019d knocked through the wall from the room to the office, thanks to his super-strength, and had FRIDAY order a door to replace the hole he\u2019d just knocked into the wall, he cleaned it up. It wasn\u2019t actually that bad, for a guy who\u2019d never done any restoration work in his life. It looked kind of smart, and the door would definitely fit without having to do much extra work. Slap a doorframe on it, and it would be good as new. Then he got the cool paints that FRIDAY had found in some storage cupboard somewhere and got to work on painting the room, which was previously just white walls \u2014 boring. Peter had to climb on the ceiling to reach some of the high bits, but hey, no-one was at work yet. There was no one who could possibly see him climbing around on the ceiling. After he\u2019d done the first wall, it turned out he quite enjoyed painting, which boded well for the other three walls, as well as the ones he\u2019d inevitably have to paint for the therapist\u2019s office.\nOnce the room was painted a subtle, calming light blue-colour, it was about 7:30 and Pete was beginning to see it all coming together. He sat down with a thump on one of the ugly armchairs FRIDAY had found in some other storage closet (placeholders until the sofas he\u2019d ordered last night arrived), thinking about decorating.\u00a0\nPeter had a rough idea for what he wanted this room to be like. He\u2019d just thought about what he\u2019d want in a chill room and essentially just pressed \u2018buy\u2019. Half of the stuff wouldn\u2019t arrive until next week, given the short notice, including most of the furniture. But a lot of the stuff he\u2019d paid for express delivery to get it delivered for the day, hence the sofas on their way. And in the mean time, well\u2026he\u2019d ordered a couple of things for his office a couple of days ago that he decided he could actually just put in the comfort room - a lava lamp, several cushions and blankets. By the end of it, he thought he\u2019d done a pretty good job. The room was painted, there was a hole into the office for the new therapist, and he had plans in place for decoration. FRIDAY would tell him when any of the new stuff would be delivered.\u00a0\nOf course, there was no point in the comfort room if it didn\u2019t come with the attached help he had suggested to Mary. Which is why his call to Sam from last night had been crucial to making today work. Sam \u2014 as in the Falcon, one of the Avengers\u2014 was a licensed therapist, and Peter figured he would probably have contacts who were therapists. And some of them were probably looking for a job, right?\u00a0\nOnce he\u2019d explained the idea \u2014 going into depth about his conversation with Mary and explaining that he thought it would be a good idea for the Stark employees to at least have access to help for their mental health, as the American healthcare system was bullshit \u2014 it turned out, Sam agreed with him, and thought it was a superb idea. They\u2019d had what was quite a nice conversation about his occasional job as Acting CEO, which apparently Sam hadn\u2019t known about. Sam said he wished he could also sometimes be the CEO of a billion dollar company. Peter had told him that he could probably just ask Tony if Sam wanted to try it out for a day, and Sam had chuckled. But the main resolution was that Sam agreed to help Peter out.\nPeter had been right, that some of the therapists would be looking for jobs. Sam had made a few calls for him and chosen a friend of his who he thought would fit right for the situation, Emily. Sam said that she was patient, friendly and remained calm. Emily had been keen on the role, as well, so Peter took her number. Peter had given her a ring and told her to come in for a trial run. Peter made a mental note to send an email around inviting people to book up sessions with their new, free, private therapist called Emily. And also to send Sam a present as a thank you.\u00a0\nPeter probably wasn\u2019t supposed to just hire people, so he sent a quick email from his phone down to someone in HR to explain the situation. HR would probably sort Emily out with everything new employees got\u2026a contract, an NDA, possibly? Peter didn\u2019t know much about how it worked. He\u2019d never had to sign any contracts or pieces of paper saying he worked at Stark Industries, except maybe the slightly-mistruthful declaration that he was an intern (which, in fairness, was official Stark paperwork that normal employees used). But even when he\u2019d started, when Tony hardly knew Peter, other than that he was Spiderman and pretty good with science and technology, Tony had never made him sign an NDA. Even when Peter had seen all sorts of confidential files and unreleased products. Even when he\u2019d gone for a test drive in one of the Iron Man suits, just to see what it was like. (Peter had almost thrown up, but it had been exhilarating).\nBy the time he\u2019d done all he could do with the comfort room, it was 8 o\u2019clock and time to get to work\u2026well, different work. Next on the schedule was his meeting with the legal team, which he\u2019d scheduled for nine o\u2019clock, on the dot. True, it was probably unfair to kick off the day with a meeting for the whole team: they probably had previous plans, other meetings. But FRIDAY had pushed them back in order to have the meeting, as it was just too important to consider giving the employees some pre-warning. He had issues to sort, and the meeting was sort of killing two birds with one stone. First off, it meant he wouldn\u2019t have to go to the legal department and ask them how they were doing, just like he\u2019d been doing for the rest of the departments. Hopefully none of the legal team would want to pull a gun on him, even after he talked at them for an hour. Peter could just ask each of them whilst they were sat at the table whether they had grievances with Stark Industries. And second, of course, he needed to talk about his action against the Daily Media, and the whole debacle from the day previously. There were several options for prosecuting the newspaper and Marcus specifically (from the Daily Media, not to be confused with Marcus \u2018Mark from Marketing\u2019).\u00a0\nPeter had worn a pyjama shirt and sweatpants to do the early morning work, aware that painting was messy, but that wouldn\u2019t really fit a serious meeting with the legal team, so he retreated to Tony\u2019s penthouse to have a shower and put on one of his suits, which were actually growing on him. The one he was wearing was a deep navy, worn with a crisp white shirt, and even better, his name badge was actually attached on to it, so Happy wouldn\u2019t get mad at him.\u00a0\nTime was tight, but he arrived at the meeting before the legal team got there and sat down, waiting. During the dull moments of being Spiderman last night, when he was sat on the roofs of building waiting for the slightest movement to trigger his Peter tingle, he\u2019d read up on legal documents and language, ready for the meeting. He still had no idea what he was doing, but hopefully he wouldn\u2019t be as lost.\u00a0\n\u201cMr Parker, it\u2019s a pleasure.\u201d The head of the legal team, a guy named Andrew Maguire, nodded at him, followed by his team. They all had a sort of dazed look of surprise on their faces. It was clear that they had all only just read the email he\u2019d sent fairly late last night, requesting the meeting at nine.\u00a0\n\u201cApologies for the early request, it was sort of an emergency. We\u2019re just waiting on Ms Roberts from PR, and Kai from HR, who I requested appear at this meeting as well, due to their relevance with the situation. Their offices are of course a little further than yours.\u201d That brought out a general chuckle from the room. And so Peter seized his chance. Get the first bird out of the way, so to speak.\u00a0\n\u201cAs we\u2019re waiting, I\u2019m sure the news has circulated that I\u2019ve been doing a tour of the building whilst I\u2019m in this position. I was getting introduced to some of the employees, and asking about their problems with Stark Industries. I hadn\u2019t gotten around to you guys yet, and here you all are, so. Hello, if we haven\u2019t met. My name is Peter Parker, Intern Director and currently Acting CEO of Stark Industries.\u201d\u00a0\nBizarrely, this led to a circle of introductions around the table. It was nice to be introduced to the team, although Peter had never been the best at remembering names.\u00a0\n\u201cMy main aim for this \u2018tour\u2019, so to speak, was to talk to everyone about their role here and whether they have any problems, suggestions for improvement, that sort of thing. I\u2019m in a room full of lawyers right now. We pay you to fix our problems, I know that. But it\u2019s more of a personal type thing. Just yesterday, I made a commitment to one employee to bring in a private therapist, free of charge, for all employees to have access to. Nothing is off limits.\u201d Peter thought about that for a second. \u201cWell, some things might be. I\u2019m not sure Mr Stark would want me to let you all have free reign of the Iron Man suits, but most things I can probably grant you. So, go, I want to hear it.\u201d\u00a0\nSome of the lawyers sat in their seats, shifting uncomfortably, clearly uncomfortable with shittalking their workplace to their boss. Peter got it, really. It made sense. But finally, after about thirty seconds of awkward deliberation, someone put their hand up.\u00a0\n\u201cThis is really really trivial, but I was wondering whether it could be possible to install a water fountain up on our floor? We have to get the lift down to the canteen to get some water, and it\u2019s kind of a pain.\u201d\n\u201cDone!\u201d Peter slapped his hand on the table. \u201cC\u2019mon, guys, we\u2019re going to be here for a while, let\u2019s get to it. Who wants what?\u201d\nAfter that, several more hands went up, asking for extremely specific things that only filthy rich lawyers could possibly want in their office. Peter agreed to buy them a coffee machine, and even signed a couple of them up for the trial sessions with Emily, which delighted him. Someone even had a suggestion for him to get some fish in the comfort room, which made Peter actually gape in awe! Peter loved looking at fish in their little aquarium fish bowls! One of his favourite outings with May had been a couple of years ago when he\u2019d gone to Sea World, and had gone through the tunnel where they have all kinds of big fish and even turtles in the artificial pool. Okay, so, they couldn\u2019t have turtles int he comfort room, but they could have fish! He was just itching to get on to some websites and start ordering stuff for the little fish friends.\u00a0\nHe was right in the middle of hearing a guy called Mr Macintyre explaining his suggestion for a collective Stark Party for Tony\u2019s birthday, which Peter privately knew Tony would hate, but hell, he had asked for suggestions, when he heard movement outside the room. Peter\u2019s head turned to the door. He could hear the footsteps of Kai and Ms Roberts, not that the other occupants of the room would be able to. \u201cHold that thought, Mr Macintyre. I do believe our other arrivals are here.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cApologies, all.\u201d Ms Roberts said. \u201cThe lifts are pretty crowded right now. Everyone was getting off at every floor.\u201d Peter smacked his head \u2014 he really should have remembered that. Nine am, everyone was just beginning to arrive to try and get to their offices, and he\u2019d stuck Ms Roberts and Kai in all that mess. At least they\u2019d found each other and arrived at the same time.\n\u201cAw, shoot.\u201d Peter apologised. \u201cSorry, I should have gotten FRIDAY to fast-track you here. That\u2019s my bad. Anyways, come and sit down.\u201d\u00a0\nAnd from there, Peter turned from his light demeanour saying yes to water fountains and coffee machines, to his more serious one. The meeting took a darker turn. The legal team made him write a testimony word for word about what happened in the office with Jaym\u2014Alex, whose full name was apparently Alexandra Rivers. They then gave him the details on her as well as a previous offence of defamation of character against a celebrity. The legal team believed she\u2019d gone through a damaging childhood experience with someone similar to Tony and felt the need to ruin Tony\u2019s life as a result, but that was just their guess. Ms Roberts and Kai gave their experiences with Alex. The lawyers advised settling the issues with Alex pulling a gun on Peter through the justice system, as that was a criminal offence, but the attempted defamation of character would be a civil lawsuit that they would work on drawing up.\nIt would be the Legal team\u2019s main priority for the day, Peter decided. Anything else could wait, it was less important. As long as those articles that Marcus planned to publish for the Daily Media did not get released, Tony\u2019s reputation wouldn\u2019t get hit, Peter\u2019s identity would remain a secret and Tony wouldn\u2019t be accused of being a shit dad despite not even being a dad. Well, not really being a dad. He was listed as Peter\u2019s official guardian, just in case his Parker \u2018luck\u2019 returned and May was the result of it \u2014 May\u2019s suggestion, not his. May had asked the billionaire, at the embarrassment of Peter, and Tony had been shocked but delighted.\u00a0\nSo, technically Tony wasn\u2019t a dad, but he was a father figure. Peter would totally call Tony his dad if he thought Tony would be okay with it, though.\u00a0\nHe wanted the civil lawsuit arranged and sorted before he passed the reins back to Pepper tomorrow, so Peter got FRIDAY to suspend all meetings the Legal team had and got them cracking with the lawsuit, dismissing Ms Roberts and Kai to get back to their departments. Peter, too, didn\u2019t have much to add to the conversation. James Blake guessed they\u2019d probably be done with at least the rough draft in a couple of hours, so Peter made plans to return. After all, he had another extremely important phone call lined up, to check he hadn\u2019t messed up the whole\u2026lawsuit business.\u00a0\nAnd then, because there wasn\u2019t much he could do, it was back to his tour. There were two places he hadn\u2019t been: R&amp;D, his baby, his favourite of all the departments, and Assembly &amp; Production. But before he toured his actual building, he had a couple of calls to make. It was 11am \u2014 god, the meeting with the legal team had been two hours?! \u2014 which meant in British time, it was 16:00, and woah, okay, midnight in Hong Kong. Maybe a call to Hong Kong was a little ambitious, but a late afternoon call to the London department had to fit into his tour of Stark Industries, otherwise he was simply neglecting the other departments, and Pepper wasn\u2019t exactly running them as she was still busy reconstructing Tokyo.\nOf course, Pepper was hardly ever in London, so the branch was mostly directed under a lovely English lady called Isabella Taylor-Jones. Pepper did frequent video calls with her, and was still technically in charge of all senior decisions, but she mainly trusted Isabella to get on with it.\u00a0\nPeter assumed Isabella would have been informed about the YoungBoss protocol, as one of the most senior members of the Stark team. And apparently, as she answered his video call with a surprised look, he was right.\u00a0\n\u201cYou must be Peter Parker,\u201d she smiled with a quintessentially posh English accent. \u201cI\u2019ve heard an awful lot about you from Pepper, of course. I\u2019m Isabella Taylor-Jones, leading the London branch. But, of course, you know that.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYes,\u201d Peter found himself smiling back. She was easy to like: he could tell why Pepper left her to do the work. \u201cI wanted to chat to you, just to get in contact. I didn\u2019t want you feeling abandoned, all the way over in London.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWell, that is very kind of you, Mr Parker. Did you have any specific questions?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m touring the New York branch department by department.\u201d Peter explained, as he\u2019d been explaining to people for the last couple of days. \u201cOf course, I can\u2019t do that for the London branch, because I\u2019m in New York, so the best way I thought was just to contact you directly, check how everything is. That\u2019s all, just checking in. Any concerns, issues?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI have no problems, Mr Parker, other than that I miss Pepper! She hasn\u2019t been to London on a work trip for over a year, and I miss her.\u201d Isabella glanced across the room, Peter could see across the screen. \u201cWhen she\u2019s back in the office, you should tell her to take a break and come and visit me.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI will definitely do that. So all is good across the Atlantic, then?\u201d Peter wanted to leave her alone, let her get on with everything she clearly needed to do. It was probably an inconvenient time to call, right at the end of the working day and completely out of the blue, but she\u2019d taken it well.\n\u201cAll is operating as normal, Mr Parker. I keep a tight ship.\u201d Isabella smiled again, less distracted than as she had been seconds before.\n\u201cAs does Pepper. I can see why she chose you, of all those capable.\u201d Peter grinned back.\u00a0\n\u201cAnd I can see why the gracious couple chose you, YoungBoss. I can see your face in the magazines already \u2014 the legacy passed on.\u201d Isabella sounded sincere, and Peter\u2019s face went red with embarrassment. \n\u201cOh, no, um. This is just a temporary thing, I\u2019m not actually going to be CEO.\u201d He could see how that would be a misconception, but Tony had promised it was emergency only. It made Peter kind of sad, really. He\u2019d grown to quite enjoy his little sessions as the CEO. He\u2019d be quite sad to pass it all back to Pepper.\u00a0\n\u201cWell, I\u2019d pick you as their replacement, if Pepper ever steps down. You\u2019re a nice kid, clearly a powerhouse, good at running things, and even checking up on people not in the same country as you, and not doing it at some bizarre time of night. You\u2019re a smart cookie, and a lot like Tony.\u201d Peter was pretty used to the comparisons \u2014 a lot of the higher up Stark employees had said much the same thing, but it still took him by surprise whenever someone said it outright. He always felt extremely proud to be compared to Tony. \u201cBut, hey, I\u2019m not sure Pepper ever will actually retire, y\u2019know. That woman is a force of nature, and she likes working far too much. That\u2019s why she and Tony work so well together: both of them are high-functioning.\u201d Peter agreed, their relationship was goals and honestly he could see a bit of Pepper\u2019s ferocity in MJ, too. Maybe he was a little like Tony\u2026\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter chuckled. \u201cWell it was lovely to talk to you, Isabella. Hope you have a great evening.\u201d Gosh, Peter kind of wished it could be evening already for him, but that was only in the UK. He\u2019d already redecorated a whole room and drawn up a lawsuit \u2014 that was more than most high school seniors would have to do in one day! And he still had so much more to do!\n\u201cSpeak to you later,\u00a0 Peter!\u201d Isabella said cheerily and hung up the phone.\u00a0\nPeter fought his urge to go straight to R&amp;D, his comfort zone, and instead headed for Assembly and Production. The tour continued.\u00a0\nA&amp;P was a weird branch of Stark Industries. It was smaller than the rest of the teams, because, of course, a lot of the Assembly and Production wasn\u2019t actually done in Stark Tower. They had a few products that were streamlined solely through Stark Tower, due to specific technology being needed. It was expensive to build 3D printers in multiple factories across the country. But a lot of the products, such as the Starkphone and generally any of the main products, due to be sold to consumers on a larger scale, were outsourced to other factories offsite, many of them were states away. Some even based in other countries. Many of the A&amp;P team on Stark Tower headquarters were liaisons for these other facilities, keeping everything updated and running all of the info off to Marketing and PR.\u00a0\nSo Peter went, and he learnt about the roles of each of the employees \u2014 who was in charge of what, and where. There were no problems or concerns to report, so it mostly consisted of just chatting to the employees about their jobs. He even got to chat with the owner of a factory off site, who happened to be calling. The factory owner had straightened up when he\u2019d introduced himself, at first looking slightly critical and confused at why he was talking to a 17-year-old boy.\u00a0\nThere hadn\u2019t been very much of that this time around \u2014 the general concern that it was a teenager running a company, and the disbelief. Peter supposed it was because, after last time, there had been an increased awareness of what the YoungBoss protocol actually entailed. The Stark employees knew of him, even if they hadn\u2019t met him. And it probably helped that Peter had only interacted with Stark Industries employees, rather than external organisations. That was the great thing about having no meetings with clients.\u00a0\nPete had lunch with Happy in the canteen (He\u2019d actually remembered to have lunch this time!) and then ran up to the lifts, getting FRIDAY to fast track him back up to the office he\u2019d left the legal team in. They\u2019d been there for hours and Peter wanted to see what they\u2019d been able to do with the time.\u00a0\nWhen he returned to the legal department, they\u2019d made significant progress. The lawsuit, miraculously, was basically done. Happy had once told him that lawsuits took forever, weeks even, when he was mid-complaint about something happening at Stark Industries. That had been before Peter was even intern director. But it took weeks when lawyers had other things to do and sort: Peter had got a whole room of extremely intelligent, on the ball lawyers fully concentrated on one thing, and there had been clear results. He scanned over the document, trying to piece together what half of it meant. Even having read up on legal language, a lot of it was lost on him.\u00a0\nPeter excused himself to make the call he\u2019d been dreading all day. Picking up the phone, he pressed on the contact he was looking for and then took a breath. It was, after all, a weird favour to ask a guy he hardly knew. But nevertheless, he picked up on the first ring.\u00a0\n\u201cExcuse me, Mr Murdock?\u201d Peter bit his lip. Matt might not have even saved his number.\u00a0\n\u201cSpeaking.\u201d\u00a0\nPeter had first met Matt Murdock in a caf\u00e9 in New York. Peter had noticed there was something\u2026different about Mr Murdock, and presumably Matt had the same sense about Peter. There was just something a little off about the other. It was the same reason Peter was somewhat uncomfortable when he was in a room with Captain America: it set off alarm bells for his spidey senses, even though he knew for a fact the Captain was no threat to him.\u00a0\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s um,\u201d Peter scratched the back of his neck. \u201cIt\u2019s Peter Parker. Uh, the guy you met in the caf\u00e9?\u201d\u00a0\nMr Murdock hadn\u2019t asked about his super senses, but Peter was pretty sure he could hazard a guess. And Mr Murdock had known that he worked at Stark Industries, because Peter had been en route to work and was wearing his Intern Director badge, so the cat had been out of the bag by that point.\u00a0\n\u201cOf course, Peter, hi.\u201d Matt\u2019s tone turned significantly more friendly, \u201cDo you need something?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re a lawyer, right?\u201d Peter wanted to make sure that Mr Murdock hadn\u2019t suddenly decided to change career paths before he asked his question.\u00a0\n\u201cThat I am.\u201d Mr Murdock had been calm in the caf\u00e9, and he was calm over the phone. Peter thought he could voice podcasts well, but hey, that wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\u201cIs it possible that you could read over this contract I\u2019ve just had my legal team write up? Oh \u2014 right, I should say. I\u2019m acting as CEO for the day, because Miss Potts and Mr Stark are both out of action. I don\u2019t actually have a team of lawyers at my beck and call. But there was this incident\u2014\u201d Peter went on to explain the whole debacle with the Daily Media and potential defamation of character, and the solution he and the lawyers had worked out. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to run it by Mr Stark because it would just stress him out, and I\u2019m pretty sure Pepper is on a plane right now, so\u2026you were the person I thought of? Sorry if that\u2019s weird.\u201d\n\u201cOf course I\u2019ll read over it, although I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s anything I can add that your team of lawyers haven\u2019t already thought of. I\u2019ll check they aren\u2019t fucking with you though, as you\u2019ve already had a problem with corrupt employees.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThat would be great, thanks, Mr Murdock. You are a really great lawyer, I\u2019d love for you to check it over.\u201d Peter relaxed. Okay, it wasn\u2019t as bad as he\u2019d thought it would have been. Mr Murdock had been understanding, calm, and kind.\u00a0\n\u201cNo problem, Peter. Send the file over to me. And please, do call me Matt.\u201d With that, the conversation was over and Peter got to work sending the rough draft over to Mr\u2014 Matt. Then he left his legal team to it. He did trust them, of course\u2026he just wanted a second opinion.\u00a0\nThere was another ticking time bomb about the whole situation. He knew he\u2019d have to speak to Tony at some point. It would all trickle down the grapevine. The only way Peter knew the situation with Jayme hadn\u2019t been brought to Tony\u2019s attention was because if Tony found out, his phone would have been spammed with calls. Hell, Tony would probably have broken out of the hospital to come and reprimand him. But he hadn\u2019t, and that was the way Peter wanted to keep it.\u00a0\nBut hell, it was best not to think about the overprotective-father-figure mode that Tony would go into when he found out Peter had nearly been killed on one of his only days as CEO. Tony would probably shut down the whole YoungBoss protocol, and there was no way Peter wanted that.\u00a0\nAfter he\u2019d spent an hour or two running some quick errands, sending various emails to clients and arranging Pepper\u2019s meetings for the next couple of days, it was about three o\u2019clock. But hey \u2014 he only had one place left on his tour, and it was his favourite place in the whole world.\u00a0\nPeter was in charge of Research and Development, pretty much. R&amp;D was basically run by interns, all doing their little projects, and they were ran by intern heads. And Peter run the intern heads, as intern director, on any normal day. So technically, he didn\u2019t have to consult with them during the YoungBoss protocol, but it only felt right.\u00a0\nHe\u2019d figured out that equation that had been bothering him from the back of his physics test, some complex thing about the household bot they were producing, that one of the Marketing department had requested he put a name on. Together with Isaac, he got the robot team all assembled and they discussed their advancements for the day. They\u2019d made no further progress with the equation they\u2019d been stuck on, but had made some small adjustments and changes in the bot\u2019s coding to make it more fluid in its movement. When Peter had had a spare couple of minutes during his lunch with Happy, he\u2019d started doodling the equation they\u2019d been struggling with on a napkin and had accidentally solved it.\nSo he and Isaac\u2019s team spent an hour coding that into the bot, and it fixed the problem they\u2019d had with it, which would probably advance their time schedule for about a week. He was delighted to tell the employee from Marketing their achievements. He left them, then, to discuss potential names (and Peter had been right: Isaac was delighted with the opportunity to name his robot, his creation).\u00a0\nThen he essentially went back to his normal role at Stark Industries, dancing around the labs and tinkering with people\u2019s projects, chatting to all of the interns. Peter knew them all by name, of course, and had made it fairly clear ever since his assignment that he wouldn\u2019t be overbearing, but extremely willing to help at all times, and also wanted the best for the interns. Peter had already had several things changed on the interns floor \u2014 Lisa had suggested an explosion proof room, as so many of the projects were dangerous and kept causing a lot of damage to the lab when they were being tested. Anything they wanted had pretty much been granted (except when the interns had collectively asked to buy pure gold just for the purpose of melting it down and making Peter a crown. Apparently he was \u2018a king\u2019 and needed to be recognised for it).\u00a0\nAfter he had done his rounds with the coolest bunch of science nerds ever, which, naturally, took him into the early evening, FRIDAY informed him that a lot of stuff was waiting for him just outside the comfort room. The sofas he\u2019d ordered, for one, and some other bits to make it look perfect. He sped there to do a bit of sorting, satisfied when it was complete.\u00a0\nAnd then, well. He\u2019d decided that an early patrol would finish the day off nicely. Peter liked to sit on the roofs of tall buildings, which was often where he found himself when he was out as Spiderman with nothing to do, waiting for something to trigger his senses. It meant he could watch the sunset and do some errands without anyone bothering him. Speaking of doing errands\u2026.\n\u201cHey, Pepper, I know you\u2019re on your plane back now but I just wanted to leave you this voicemail to say that I\u2019ve done quite a lot in the last few days and yeah\u2026just that I\u2019ll explain some of the stuff when you get back to the States. Take care!\u201d Peter knew he needed to actually go into depth of his changes \u2014 it was Pepper\u2019s company, after all. It wasn\u2019t fair that she\u2019d return without knowing all of the things he\u2019d done in the last two days. He was just glad that he\u2019d made some of the changes mostly complete \u2014 the comfort room was basically done, with the sofas fitted, and he\u2019d even gotten a construction guy to help him fit the door, that had been just before he came out as Spiderman. It looked cool now, with a TV and games console set up, ready on one sofa, and then a shelf of books in case that was more up people\u2019s street. The room was constantly emitting calming music, set up from a speaker that FRIDAY had control of. The lava lamp on the cabinet\u00a0 gave the room a sort of endearing quality, next to the fish bowl with several varieties of pretty fish that Emily had promised to take care of. He\u2019d already named one that was red and gold after Tony. Peter\u2019s favourite part of the whole room was probably bean bag corner, which was simply a corner full of bean bags in varying colours.\u00a0\nPeter was thinking back on his two days as boss when an Iron Man suit came flying out of the sky and landed on the roof. Peter knew better than to suspect that Tony wasn\u2019t in it, and as he\u2019d suspected, the repulsors powered off and Tony stepped out of the suit, looking extremely ill and rough still. Pepper had lifted the bed rest before she\u2019d gotten on the plane, but Tony was under strict instruction not to do anything reckless, like, say, flying one of the suits.\u00a0\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d Peter warned him, heart racing. If Tony wanted to contact him, he could have called. Peter probably would have picked up, even though he was planning on avoiding Tony. \u201cPepper will kill you.\u201d\u00a0\nTony skipped over the subject immediately, launching into a dramatic voice. \u201cYou didn\u2019t come to see me the other day.\u201d Tony sniffed, pretending to be hurt. Probably. Peter could rarely get a tell on his emotions: the man so often launched into sarcasm that it was difficult to distinguish from anything else.\u00a0\n\u201cI know, I\u2019m sorry. I was tired.\u201d It was the truth, but he had evaded a visit to Tony in favour of well, going out as Spiderman.\u00a0\n\u201cYou then went on to uncover an entire family who were in the mob and help get them arrested, Peter, I read the news. You weren\u2019t tired, you were avoiding me.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, fine, I was avoiding you.\u201d True: he was avoiding Tony. He didn\u2019t particularly want to speak about his two days as the CEO, because by the end of it he\u2019d truly kind of forgotten that he was only the CEO temporarily, and that all of the new projects he\u2019d opened and started, he wouldn\u2019t be in charge of when Pepper finally flew back from Japan. And that made him sad: he wanted to make sure the comfort room was perfect, not just mostly-done! And that the lawsuit all went through in the end, and continue to make decisions about what was best for Stark Industries. He\u2019d enjoyed his time as CEO, something he\u2019d never thought he would say. As Intern Director, most of the things he\u2019d arranged and done as CEO would not be acceptable to continue doing. And that sucked. Big time.\u00a0\nSo yes, he\u2019d been avoiding Tony. Peter had overstepped the mark in so many areas, and he didn\u2019t really want to be punished for it.\n\u201cYou should have told me, Pete!\u201d There was simply so many things he could apply that to, and he didn\u2019t know how much Tony knew, so there was only one thing for it. \u00a0\nPeter stood up from his position on the roof to apologise. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, was it the lawsuit? I know we only arranged it in two days but I thought all of the clauses were solid, and I got Mr Murdock to have a look at it as well, and he said it seemed sound. Or maybe the robot \u2014 you don\u2019t like the suggestions I gave Isaac do you? You don\u2019t actually have to implement them by the way, he knows what he\u2019s doing. He only said he would because I was in charge, but you can tell him I was just joking about calling them that\u2014\u201d \u00a0\n\u201cPeter\u2014\u201d Tony went to stop him, but he felt the need to carry on. Shit \u2014 he\u2019d done so many things in the two days without getting permission from either Pepper or Tony. Shit shit shit. They were going to fire him as Intern Director.\n\u201cOh shoot, it was the comfort room, right? I know, I know, I should\u2019ve gotten permission before redecorating the whole room and literally knocking a wall through and hiring an employee, but I spoke to this employee called Mary and she was like. Wise, and said it was a cool idea, and I thought it was too so I just did it so then Pepper wouldn\u2019t have to listen to my rambling, because making a comfort room isn\u2019t really an Intern Director\u2019s job but I wanted to do it. And also if Pepper thinks the intern fair isn\u2019t a thing we should do then that\u2019s fine but I did get one of the employees in the Human Resources department to sort of start planning it with my permission so she will have to sort that out, sorry?\u201d Peter was speaking at the speed of light, and he thought he\u2019d probably covered everything he\u2019d done that was out of line, but Tony was just staring at him wide eyed.\u00a0\n\u201cPete,\u201d Tony said slowly. \u201cI was here to talk about the woman who tried to kill you on Wednesday?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOh,\u201d Peter looked at the floor. He kicked some gravel with his trainers. He\u2019d just told all of that to Mr Stark for no reason? Now he really was going to get told off. \u201cYeah, that happened.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cKid, you should have told me,\u201d Tony looked visibly upset when Peter glanced up from the floor. And Peter should have told Tony, of course he should have. But he was trying to be independent, and resilient, and fix problems without getting help, and he didn\u2019t want to worry Tony.\n\u201cDid Happy tell you?\u201d Peter asked.\n\u201cNo, not Happy, although he and I will be having words about why he didn\u2019t think to inform me of a seriously high security concern when my kid was in charge and almost got killed by some nutter journalist woman. Head of Security, Jesus.\u201d Peter blinked at the \u2018my kid\u2019, mentally storing that away for later when he can even think about digesting that. His heart skipped a beat when Tony said that. My kid.\u00a0\nBut Peter is quick to defend Happy. \u201cNo, don\u2019t punish him. It was me. I asked him not to tell you. I said that I was going to tell you.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOh.\u201d That stumped Tony. \u201cAnd technically he couldn\u2019t dispute that because you were his boss. Well, that\u2019s fairly smart, kid, although I am a little upset you didn\u2019t want me to know.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI kind of guilt tripped him into not telling you because you were il. You are ill.\u201d Peter gestured to Tony.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d Tony shook his head in disbelief. \u201cWe spoke just after it happened!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI wanted to sort it out before you heard about it! They were planning to publish an article that would really hurt your reputation Tony, something about me being your secret kid and you being a shit dad because you left me alone for most of my life,\u201d Peter explained.\u00a0\nTony paused, digesting that statement, before continuing. \u201cWell, that hits quite deep for the bucket of personal trauma, and it would have stung if I\u2019d read it, probably would have been fairly accurate,\u201d Peter frowned. Tony shouldn\u2019t think of himself as a bad dad - he was literally being a good dad by being here reprimanding him for lying, and Tony wasn\u2019t even Peter\u2019s dad. He had big dad energy. \u201cBut if you think I care about the article, kid, you\u2019re far off base. I care far more about this woman almost killing you.\u201d\u00a0\nPeter rolled his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s a gun, Mr Stark. You and I both know I\u2019ve dealt with a lot more than stray guns as Spiderman. Doing it as Peter Parker isn\u2019t that different.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say anything?\u201d Tony clearly couldn\u2019t quite believe it, that Peter had almost been killed and then had decided not to encroach upon the topic with his mentor who was ill in the hospital.\n\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t want to worry you. And also\u2026.\u201d Peter grimaced. \u201cI didn\u2019t want a repeat of the stabbing incident.\u201d Tony had gone overboard then. Anything was necessary to avoid that happening again, even avoiding the truth.\n\u201cHey, Underoos, I had a perfectly normal reaction to that.\u201d Peter raised his eyebrows. \u201cYou get stabbed, I up your protocols. That\u2019s normal.\u201d\u00a0\nPeter decided to be blatantly open with his mentor. \u201cYou\u2019re a helicopter parent, Mr Stark, and you would have broken out of hospital just to come and see me, even though it would have been completely unnecessary.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cUnnecessary?\u201d Tony exploded with disbelief. \u201cYou almost got shot in the head!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWell, I should have called you after it happened, I agree with that.\u201d Peter mused. \u201cBut you would have overreacted, so I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t. She\u2019s in custody, now, anyways. And there\u2019s a lawsuit in the way.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, kid, about that,\u201d Tony started shaking his head in amazement, a complete switch in emotion. \u201cI leave you alone for two days, and you start becoming a lawyer? What\u2019s that about. You realise Pepper could have done that, there was no need to stress yourself out by doing that.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt was my mess, I needed to clean it up.\u201d Peter waved Tony\u2019s concerns away.\u00a0\n\u201cAnyways, I didn\u2019t get much of the rest of your speech.\u201d Tony tried to remember, scrunching his eyes closed in the process, \u201cSomething about robots, something about a therapist? It was fairly garbled, and I was trying to get a word in edgeways, but. well.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cSorry, that\u2019s my bad.\u201d Peter smiled, just a little. The reprimanding was over.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Wanna explain your couple of days to me?\u201d\u00a0\nAnd Peter launched into an explanation of his tour of Stark Industries. He didn\u2019t let Tony interrupt very much, running by the information as quickly as he could, still keeping a decent amount of detail. He imagined he\u2019d have to do the same thing to Pepper when her flight landed. By the time he finished, Tony had his eyebrows raised.\u00a0\n\u201cSo let me get this straight. Not only did you do a whole sweep of the entire New York branch, you also spoke to a member of the London team, found a corrupt employee who had been leaking news from SI to the media and who turned out to be an undercover journalist was also working on a separate story for the same newspaper determined to bring me down.\u201d Tony made it sound completely incredulous, but honestly Peter thought it was fairly normal.\u00a0\n\u201cYou then created a full lawsuit into their wider company and also got the employee arrested for trying to kill you. You somehow managed to solve everyone\u2019s grievances, meet everyone and hire a therapist for a new room which you fully constructed and decorated,\u201d Tony shook his head, \u201cIn just two days! You also spent the evening as Spiderman, and in the process of doing so, took down a whole crime family. And you\u2019re worried that you\u2026failed? That you haven\u2019t lived up to my expectations?\u201d Tony shook his head. \u201cPete, kid. You\u2019ve gone above and beyond\u2026beyond that, even. You\u2019ve gone to Mars, Peter.\u00a0 You\u2019ve done things in the last two days that Pepper and I hadn\u2019t even thought of. That comfort room of yours? Directly hiring a therapist who was out of work that you heard from Sam was trustworthy? Genius, kid, and I\u2019m not talking about science. Yeah. Yeah.\u201d Tony started to nod repeatedly. \u201cPeter?\u201d\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Peter said, beaming. The praise he just got, the genuine admiration, the love that Tony radiated whenever he spoke, was beyond any compliment he\u2019d ever received. Yeah, Peter would call Tony his dad without any hesitation. He thought back to Tony\u2019s reaction to the article\u2019s content. Probably accurate. Tony thought he would be a bad dad, because of his own. Because of Howard Stark. Peter wanted more than anything to tell Tony that it wasn\u2019t the case, that Tony was so nurturing, so kind, such a good father figure, that Tony could call Peter his kid and Peter would be fine with that, but it wasn\u2019t the time. Tony was buzzing just as much as him.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a confession. The real truth now.\u201d Tony waved a hand up into the air. \u201cI think you\u2019re finally ready to hear it.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cMhmm?\u201d Peter ran through possibilities in his mind \u2014 what could Tony be telling him? That he and Pepper were finally going to get married? Or something to do with the Avengers? Oh my god what if he was going to be made an official member of the Avengers? It had been a test, last time, but this time maybe he was ready to tackle being part of a team. He\u2019d remain a frosty distance from Captain America, of course, after the whole Tony/Steve debacle. Peter was loyal to Tony, even if he did have just a couple of questions about the shield and Bucky\u2019s metal arm. But Peter was rambling, and missed the first part of what Tony was saying in his ideas about the confession.\n\u201cSo, Pepper and I had a talk a while ago, about the future.\u201d Tony paused, then continued. \u201cOur future, and the future of the company. And we\u2019ve decided that, well\u2026if you\u2019re comfortable with it\u2026you\u2019re going to be the future of the company.\u201d Peter\u2019s brain stopped working. He couldn\u2019t\u2026function. There were no words.\n\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d Peter asked breathlessly.\u00a0\n\u201cWell, you\u2019ll be the CEO of Stark Industries when Pepper decides to step down. Putting it bluntly Peter\u2026you\u2019re my heir.\u201d Tony revealed, a small smile on his face as he looked at Peter.\u00a0\nPeter stared at Tony, eyebrows raised very highly and mouth gaping open. He was mute, he couldn\u2019t even move. He just stared at Tony, and then looked down at the floor.\u00a0\nStanding on top of the building apparently wasn\u2019t a good place for a confession like that, because Peter felt\u2026like there was no air. It was too much, too big to comprehend.\u00a0\n\u201cPete?\u201d Tony checked. \u201cYou good?\u201d\nPeter looked back up at Tony, and promptly fainted.\u00a0\nPeter\u2019s second time as CEO had been full of success, or at least so people told him. It turned out that in the two days Peter had been in charge, he had singlehandedly managed to increase productivity by 22% across Stark Industries! He\u2019d increased employee satisfaction significantly, despite its already high level. Stark employees had good things to say about their temporary CEO, and flooded both Tony and Pepper\u2019s work emails with compliments about Peter. They all stated he had been calm and patient with them, aiding them with their work and listening to their suggestions for the company. In short, they wanted him back. Apparently him listening to their problems had\u2026made them more productive?\nTony and Pepper were delighted, and had decided to move him up from \u2018emergency-only CEO\u2019 to \u2018CEO in training\u2019. That was what they were calling it at least, so that the company wouldn\u2019t have to do a press release about their new CEO, which was what Tony thought his role was. Peter disagreed \u2014 he was still training, no matter how many meetings he\u2019d led by himself or changes he enacted. He wasn\u2019t a CEO \u2014 not yet. (Pepper and Tony privately disagreed - Peter was already a CEO. He didn\u2019t need much training to fit into the role).\nIt had taken some getting used to, the idea of being Tony\u2019s heir, replacing Pepper. Also, apparently it was only a surprise to him. None of the employees who he\u2019d spilled the beans to were surprised. Happy had known in advance, as had some of the other Avengers. No one seemed surprised at the new revelation. Even Aunt May knew! She\u2019d signed papers dating several months back! All of this time, ever since him becoming an intern director, he was supposed to have been training to be the heir. That was the whole point of the YoungBoss protocol, not that Peter had understood that.\u00a0\nTony had been almost as concerned about Peter having fainted at the revelation as he had been when Peter had been stabbed that one time. When Peter had woken up, with a good deal of grogginess, his mentor was holding him in his arms, tapping his face gently and going, \u201cPete? You with me, kid?\u201d Full dad mode, basically.\u00a0\nHe and Tony had had many chats about the concept of Peter being the heir to the company. Tony\u2019s legacy loomed before him. It was terrifying. It was a multi-billion dollar company that would be placed on his shoulders when he felt ready to take over fully. He\u2019d had discussions about it with Pepper, as well \u2014 Pepper wasn\u2019t planning on retiring for a good few years, even though she could obviously retire comfortably as she was. Both of them were planning on helping Peter settle into the new role, and not until he\u2019d lived his teenage and college life to the fullest. It wasn\u2019t like Pepper was just going to abandon him when he left high school \u2014 he would take on partial responsibility.\u00a0\nBut he still worried. Him being the heir cropped up into their conversation with a fair amount of frequency, often when the other least expected it.\u00a0\n\u201cI still can\u2019t believe I was supposed to be the heir this whole time,\u201d Peter spilled his thoughts one day in their lab session, \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t tell me!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI thought you knew, kid,\u201d Tony had grinned, who was working on one of the Spiderman suits to increase the tensile strength. \u201cI thought it was obvious!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNot to me!\u201d Peter said, attaching the little spider logo to the front of the suit. The logo on this suit doubled as a body camera, which was pretty cool.\u00a0\nThere were, of course, more deeper and meaningful conversations about it all. Peter would wake in the dead of night, scramble for his phone, and dial Tony\u2019s number, breathless.\u00a0\n\u201cI can\u2019t do it, Mr Stark, I can\u2019t.\u201d Peter was truly woeful, and he would hear as Tony sat up from the bed to talk to him.\n\u201cWhat can\u2019t you do, kiddo?\u201d He would ask, sounding concerned. Peter\u2019s nightmares had returned in greater frequency \u2014 the kid had had some bad ones about Tony dying, about May dying\u2026it wasn\u2019t good.\u00a0\n\u201cI can\u2019t run Stark Industries, Tony,\u201d Peter sobbed into the phone, \u201cI\u2019ll sink your company, I\u2019ll ruin it. it\u2019s all I do, I ruin everything I touch.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWoah, kid, that is not true.\u201d Tony immediately backtracked, and refuted the statement with arguments about how the kid did the opposite of what he said, because it was true. Everything Peter touched made the world better, brighter: from Spiderman, to his work at Stark Industries and especially his contributions during the YoungBoss protocol.\u00a0\nTony had spoken clearly, and calmly and even managed to ground Peter from his panic attack by talking about meaningless science stuff. Peter fell back into a dreamless sleep afterward. It was crazy, the effect Tony could have even over the phone. Whenever Peter seemed to have subpar health, be it physical or mental, Tony would turn into even more of a dad then he was normally, examples being the panic attacks, the Stabbing Incident and the most recent one, the Fainting Incident (as Peter liked to called it).\u00a0\nAnd yet, whilst there had been undoubtable benefits from Pete\u2019s second stint as YoungBoss and his promotion up to heir of the company, there had, also, unfortunately been some repercussions, namely the conversation he\u2019d had with his Principal, as Peter had dreaded.\u00a0\nPeter Parker hated his school principal. Midtown was a reputable school, known for having smart students. Smart students were supposed to get internships like the one he\u2019d had at Stark Industries, and yet the school had never believed him. He could get a signed letter from Tony Stark and Pepper Potts themselves and the school would still never believe him.\u00a0\nHell, Peter was doing college lectures from MIT in his free time. He\u2019d pretty much moved on from Midtown, mentally. The only reason he was still around was to graduate with his class, and because he\u2019d feel bad leaving MJ and Ned. The two days he\u2019d missed from school to go and be the CEO of a literal billion dollar company certainly hadn\u2019t been \u2018detrimental to his education\u2019 or a sign of his \u2018continued poor behaviour, exacerbating the situation from the field trips\u2019.\u00a0\nSo, that was how he\u2019d found himself in Principal Morita\u2019s office, his asshole principal who was chewing him out for his \u2018fake internship\u2019 and wanted to suspend him for skipping school without permission. He\u2019d only been in the office for five minutes and he already wanted to die.\u00a0\n\u201cI mean, Parker, seriously. Take a look at this letter, and tell me it seems real,\u201d his principal slid the letter across the desk. Peter had never seen it in his life, because he\u2019d gotten Eva, Pepper Potts\u2019 literal assistant to send it to the school when he took the two days off to run a company instead of attending what, like ten lessons that wouldn\u2019t teach him anything? Peter glanced at the letter \u2014 written on thick calligraphy paper, with the little Stark Industries logo on the top. It read:\n\nTo the Principal of Midtown School of Science &amp; Technology,\u00a0\n\n\nThis a formal notice to state that student \u2018Peter Parker\u2019 in senior year will be excused from school for today, as his presence is required at Stark Industries due to an emergency that is confidential. \u00a0\n\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns, please contact Stark Industries at this email: [email\u00a0protected]. Peter has assured me he will contact his teachers personally to find out what work he has missed out on.\u00a0\n\n\nKind regards,\u00a0\n\n\nEva\n\n\nSecretary to Pepper Potts, CEO.\u00a0\n\nPrincipal Morita put both hands on the desk and stared at Peter in the eyes. It felt like an interrogation. \u201cPeter. You have been a student at Midtown High for four years now, so you should know perfectly well that only a parent or guardian can authorise an absence. This letter is not an appropriate form of authorisation, and it\u2019s unbelievable that you thought it would be acceptable. I can\u2019t believe you would write a letter like this just to get out of class.\u201d\n\u201cMy aunt works. My other listed guardian was deathly ill with a chest infection,\u201d Peter defended himself, keeping his voice as light and calm as possible. There was no need to explode at his Principal, even if he was extremely infuriating. \u201cIt was an emergency. This letter was the only way I could provide immediate clarification. My other guardian\u2014\u201d He was cut off by Morita, who flung open a file dramatically.\u00a0\n\u201cOh, and let\u2019s just check who that \u2018other guardian\u2019 is, hmm.\u201d Morita scanned the file with his finger. \u201cOh yes, Tony Stark. Peter, I know you\u2019re very intelligent, but who on Earth do you think is going to believe that Tony Stark is your guardian?\u201d\n\u201cI would,\u201d came a very familiar voice from the door, and both of them turned to identify the new arrival. And there, of course, was Tony, sunglasses on and leaning on the doorframe. \u201cOh, wait.\u201d Tony pointed at himself. \u201cI\u2019m Tony Stark.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cMr Stark\u2014\u201d Principal Morita was frozen still. Peter was equally surprised. Tony was supposed to be halfway across the country to meet with a bunch of clients.\u00a0\n\u201cTony,\u201d Peter said in shock, dropping the honorific of Mr Stark. \u201cWhat\u2014? You\u2019re supposed to be in California right now,\u201d He hissed at Tony, who simply shrugged.\u00a0\n\u201cSorry I\u2019m late, kid. I know May couldn\u2019t make it, so she asked me to drop by if I had the time. And good thing I did, too, Principal Morita.\u201d Tony made direct eye contact with his Principal. Tony looked furious. \u201cLooks like I\u2019m about to save you from the Parker wrath.\u201d\u00a0\nPeter put his head in his hands. He was really never going to live down that interaction with Colonel Williamson, was he? Tony, of course, then promptly welcomed himself in and sat down on the spare chair, placing his sunglasses on Morita\u2019s desk.\u00a0\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d The Principal finally came to his senses, questioning what the \u2018Parker wrath\u2019 was.\u00a0\n\u201cWell you see, Peter here likes to put people in their place almost as much as me, especially when they\u2019re being unfathomably stupid. Now I\u2019ve saved you from Peter, unfortunately you get my wrath, which is probably worse considering I\u2019m a concerned guardian rather than a student who\u00a0respects you.\u201d Tony tapped his fingers on the desk, pausing. \u201cI admit, Pete\u2019s story does sound like a tall tale, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should have immediately dismissed it. We gave you proof \u2014 my signature on forms, an official form stating about his internship. Honestly, it\u2019s believable.\u201d Tony raised an eyebrow at Morita, waiting for his response.\u00a0\n\u201cAnd why did you feel the right to pull Peter from school?\u201d Morita clearly decided to skip on responding to that whole speech. Peter winced. Tony did not like it when someone just moved onto a new topic, unresolved. This was about to get vicious.\u00a0\n\u201cWell you see, he was recently promoted.\u201d Tony sounded so proud, but Peter was internally groaning. It had to be one of the most painful experiences of his life. His principal really didn\u2019t need to know about his promotion.\n\u201cOh?\u201d It was a little insulting how Principal Morita just didn\u2019t believe him and sounded so surprised at Peter\u2019s success. He was fairly intelligent, after all.\u00a0\n\u201cSee, Peter here is the third in command, now. This is all confidential information of course, and I trust that you won\u2019t repeat it, but this teenage boy that you\u2019re calling a liar could come down on you with the force of our whole legal team, and I wouldn\u2019t stop him.\u201d Tony said in a matter of fact tone. Peter knew that Tony wasn\u2019t bluffing: he genuinely trusted Peter with the table of lawyers, after the lawsuit for the whole Daily Media Defamation case had gone through okay, and Stark Industries as well as Tony personally had been paid a significant amount in damages.\u00a0\n\u201cThird in command, what is that, like, he\u2019s one of the top three interns?\u201d Morita cemented the fact that he truly was an idiot. Peter blinked. Did his Principal really think Tony Stark would make a special trip just for a normal intern?\u00a0\nTony looked at him in disbelief, like he was stupid. \u201cNo, as in, third in command of the company. He ranks below Pepper and I, well\u2026for now at least.\u201d Peter shot him a warning glare. They\u2019d had talks about announcing it to the world, that Peter was a new CEO (which he wasn\u2019t, as much as Tony boasted he was. He was TRAINING. There was a large difference). Tony argued that Peter technically had the same level of command as him, more even. Tony didn\u2019t like to get involved with Stark Industries unless he absolutely had to. He trusted Pepper\u2019s judgement enough.\u00a0\nBut Tony continued. \u201cWe needed Peter to cover over for an emergency, as the letter stated. I was ill, and Pepper was dealing with an earthquake \u2014 it\u2019s complicated. So we got Peter to run the company for a couple of days, and as a trio, we all collectively decided that him missing two days of high school wouldn\u2019t be detrimental to his education.\u201d\nPrincipal Morita blinked, and stared at Peter as though he was a stranger. His next speech was stilted and broken. \u201cWell. If Peter is still enrolled at Midtown, he has to attend classes, and his guardian has to sign the slip next time, not some random secretary.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll sign the slip next time,\u201d Tony grinned. Peter stared at the wall, wanting to die, trying to block his mind from all the possibilities. It was Tony\u2026literally anything could happen.\u00a0\n\u201cSo, you are his guardian?\u201d Morita had turned from looking uncomfortable to looking like he was going to have a panic attack, all of his worst fears coming true. Peter tried to take the look on his Principal\u2019s face and superimpose it onto Flash\u2019s. He\u2019d never see Flash\u2019s reaction, of course, because they\u2019d be announcing Peter\u2019s position as the Heir after he\u2019d graduated, and he planned on never seeing Flash again after graduation. But it was a nice thought, seeing Flash\u2019s world toppling down as it was revealed that, actually, Peter had only been telling the truth. And withholding most of it.\u00a0\n\u201cYes, as we stated over a year ago, I\u2019m one of his guardians.\u201d Tony cocked his head at Morita. \u201cIf you leak this to the media, we will know, by the way. I\u2019m getting someone to send over an NDA as we speak. Sorry, but we\u2019ve had issues with people before.\u201d Peter thought of Alex and everyone at the Daily Media, and winced again.\n\u201cWell.\u201d Morita said, sounding extremely worn out.\u00a0\n\u201cIn all due respect, Principal Morita, Peter doesn\u2019t need to be here anymore.\u201d Tony took a small breath, and Peter worried. Oh god, if Tony started flexing about Peter\u2026. \u00a0\n\u201cYou could ask him any question from any class and I guarantee he would get them right. This kid is a genius, and the only reason he isn\u2019t already at MIT is because when I graduated early, I was miserable. Missing two days of school isn\u2019t going to ruin his future. He\u2019s not skipping school when he leaves, Mr Morita. He\u2019s going to work, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re trying to encourage these kids to do, eventually. Leave school, get a degree, find a smart job in a tech company. It\u2019s not Pete\u2019s fault that he\u2019s so smart that he gets to fast track that process.\u201d Oh god, oh god, how embarrassing. He was just a tiny bit proud though. Peter never liked it when anyone complimented him, but Tony complimenting him on his scientific prowess was different. It felt good, nice, fatherly.\u00a0\nNeedless to say, they walked out of Midtown without Peter being suspended or even punished at all, and Morita\u2019s NDA in hand. Peter just wished he wouldn\u2019t have to return to the school on Monday morning, and try and desperately avoid Morita for the month he had left of senior year.\nAfter the fight Tony and Peter had had with his Principal to keep him from being wrongfully suspended, things had settled again. Peter was used to doing certain jobs that extended beyond the role of Intern Director, including completely setting up the intern fair in conjunction with that one employee from HR, and being in charge of the whole \u2018comfort room\u2019 idea, as he was the one who had originally implemented it. It felt good to be in control of things. He found himself glad that it wasn\u2019t only the YoungBoss protocol that he got to be important and help people. Peter left pretty much all of the meetings to Pepper, unless the military tried to open their mouths again for another meeting. When it had been announced to the military that all of their meetings would be led by Peter, the military pretty much went silent. Rhodey had told Tony that there was a new general rule across the entire US military that had been passed across by word of mouth: Do not mess with the Young Stark, aka Peter Parker. Tony found it hilarious, but Peter had groaned when he\u2019d heard that. Seriously, did Colonel Williamson have to leave him a whole fucking legacy for the entire US military?\nWhilst things had settled, it didn\u2019t mean things had been easy. Issues with the Accords had surfaced, and there had been more Avengers activity than in the past few months. Combined with Tony\u2019s dedication to certain lab projects that had unofficial deadlines, as well as his long recovery from the particularly bad chest infection, his mentor was exhausted. And what did Tony do when he was exhausted? He would spend more time in the lab, of course, working on things he didn\u2019t need to work on. Peter didn\u2019t need more efficient web shooters, that \u201ceven have electric tasers in them, just in case, Pete!\u201d These needless inventions were Tony\u2019s distraction from his looming need to sleep at night.\u00a0\nPepper was equally exhausted. From the new construction in Tokyo (as the city had recovered extremely well and quickly from the earthquake) to launch a new branch of Stark Industries, as well as problems within the Hong Kong department, she\u2019d been flying around the world without much of a break. Peter had watched her in the few meetings they\u2019d been in together over the last few weeks and she\u2019d clearly been tired.\u00a0\nIt had been breaking his heart to watch two of his favourite people in the world be so worn down. If it had been May, he would have offered to do the housework for a week, and give her a break. But whenever Peter tried to step in for Pepper and Tony, they rejected his help, telling him to focus on his school work, and that they \u2018had it under control\u2019.\nSo Peter decided to stage an intervention for the two of them. The YoungBoss protocol was strictly for emergencies only, Tony had said. But they\u2019d moved on from that. YoungBoss was no longer about Peter replacing Tony and Pepper when there was no one else: he\u2019d proved his worth. He was an heir now, the heir. He was a CEO-in-training, and he could hold his own against the weight of Stark Industries for a week or two whilst Pepper and Tony went on holiday.\u00a0\nHe proposed the idea to them over breakfast one weekend, FRIDAY on standby in case he needed to prove his statements.\u00a0\nPeter took a breath and then launched into it. \u201cMr Stark. You haven\u2019t slept in 96 hours.\u201d Tony quirked his eyebrows at that statement. \u201cYes I had FRIDAY monitor you, don\u2019t ask questions. And no, falling asleep at the lab table that one time doesn\u2019t count, you woke up five minutes later. That\u2019s not sleep. That\u2019s passing out.\u201d Peter scolded Tony. \u201cI know you have things to do, but doing them instead of sleeping is actually the opposite of productive. You need to rest.\u201d Tony looked sheepish.\u00a0\n\u201cPeter, I\u2014\u201d But Peter cut him off, turning his attention to Pepper.\u00a0\n\u201cAnd respectfully, Miss Potts, I think you need to take a break as well. You\u2019ve been exhausted for weeks, ever since Japan, and you haven\u2019t taken holiday in three solid years. Please, just hear me out.\u201d Pepper opened her mouth, and closed it again.\u00a0\nGood. They weren\u2019t going to try and defend themselves.\u00a0\n\u201cAnywhere. Go literally anywhere. You could go to Maine, Australia, Latvia, as long as you both agree to do no work whilst you\u2019re there, for Stark Industries or for the UN.\u201d Both Tony and Pepper looked at him like he was crazy. \u201cNo, no, don\u2019t look at me like that. You both deserve a break, and you\u2019re not going to grant yourself one, so\u2026I\u2019m doing it.\u201d\u00a0\nThey were both clearly taken aback. Technically, Peter had the right to at least suggest the break because of his position, but with both of them gone, it would mean that the YoungBoss protocol would have to return. Peter would be solely in charge.\n\u201cPeter, we promised you that the YoungBoss protocol would only be for emergencies.\u201d Tony said gently. \u201cWe can\u2019t abuse that to go on holiday.\u201d\n\u201cTony, with all due respect, it\u2019s not about the YoungBoss protocol. This is my future, doing it for an extra week doesn\u2019t hurt. You made me the heir, this is me taking initiative. You trust me, right?\u201d Peter was adamant about this. Tony and Pepper would have a break, no matter what. He would make them agree. They\u2019d go crazy if they didn\u2019t, he was sure of it.\u00a0\n\u201cKid, of course I trust you. If Pepper wanted to resign, I\u2019d pass the company to you in a heartbeat. I wasn\u2019t dissing your capabilities, more the fact that we\u2019d be taking a week out of your last month of senior year in high school. You\u2019ll be running this company for years, if all goes well, but you only get one more month of high school.\u201d\u00a0\nGuardians, so dramatic. May was the same way, talking about things coming to an end. As if he\u2019d be sad to leave Midtown \u2014 all it had brought him was a good deal of teasing, people calling him a liar, one best friend (who wasn\u2019t going to leave him), and a\u2026friend. MJ was complicated \u2014 friend didn\u2019t feel right, not really, not from the conversations they\u2019d been having about life and the future after high school. He was teetering on the edge of telling her about Spiderman. Anyways, Peter wasn\u2019t sad about the end of his high school career, that was the point.\n\u201cArgh, Mr Stark.\u201d Peter complained. \u201cI\u2019ve done my finals, they\u2019re not even teaching us anymore, just talking about college, and the future, and graduation. I\u2019m ready to go, I\u2019ve got college sorted and my future. I\u2019d prefer to miss the week, honestly.\u201d He would: anything to avoid a week of Flash\u2019s taunts, but there was no point getting into all that.\u00a0\n\u201cI think we should talk to May about this,\u201d Pepper glanced at Tony. \u201cIt\u2019s not something we should be doing, Peter, just so we can have a holiday.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cY\u2019all need a break. I do have one request though. Is it okay if I schedule one day off and run Stark Industries remotely for the Wednesday? We have my surprise school field trip, and I think I need to be there. MJ said she\u2019d kill me if I do my \u2018Parker thing\u2019 again,\u201d Peter rolled his eyes. \u201cApparently, people notice when I run off by myself during field trips. Oh, and I think you might need to sign me off for the week, Mr Stark?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about the signature,\u201d Tony grinned like a shark, \u201cI\u2019ve got that sorted.\u201d Okay, now Peter was worried. Nothing good ever came out of a smile like that, especially from Tony. But it seemed like he\u2019d gotten Mr Stark on board, which was a positive sign, even if it did mean letting him wreak havoc on Principal Morita as a way to bribe him into thinking it was a good idea.\u00a0\n\u201cSo, if I talk to May and she\u2019s okay with it, I\u2019m good to go?\u201d Peter asked, bouncing on his heels. This was going to work!\n\u201cOnly if she\u2019s okay with it,\u201d Pepper checked, holding up his pointer finger at him.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll talk to her! Promise. Start booking hotels!\u201d Peter called out to them as he ran back to the lab. He had some web fluid bubbling and he didn\u2019t want to leave it too long.\u00a0\nLater that Saturday, he got May\u2019s permission, and then it was set. A week of leading Stark Industries, and more importantly, a week of Tony and Pepper actually having a holiday for the first time in probably, years. They\u2019d decided to go to a small a small island in the Caribbean - very private, warm, quiet residence. Peter had bought them coconut cups to drink cocktails out of. He was extremely excited to get pictures, and even more excited to be left in trust of the company! There were only a few things he had to do before he started.\u00a0\nHe\u2019d promised Ned he\u2019d hang out with him on the Sunday. They were mid-completion of a mega Harry Potter Hogwarts build - a birthday gift for Ned from Tony back in November, but they\u2019d been busy with Star Wars builds and had only found the time to complete it after finals were over. They spent the day putting blocks together and talking about the end of high school, college, MJ, the field trip, and of course, his impending week.\u00a0\n\u201cHave they flown out yet?\u201d Ned asked.\u00a0\n\u201cYup,\u201d Peter said, checking his watch. \u201cFlight left at 9:52 am. Tony said he\u2019d text when they landed.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cDang, that\u2019s cool. I wish I could have a private jet.\u201d Ned chuckled. Peter didn\u2019t think he had a private jet, but there was no telling with Tony. He was very vividly remembering the time that he\u2019d asked for a Netflix account and Tony actually bought him the company.\u00a0\nApparently Tony had already owned it, having bought it years ago, because he\u2019d seen the potential in it, and technically just switched the ownership over to Peter. Tony said he\u2019d left the employees of Netflix to do what they wanted, he had no real input. Petter hadn\u2019t mentioned the switch over to anyone \u2014 especially May. But it had meant that all his favourite films were on Netflix, so that was a plus. The CEO of Netflix had asked him if Peter had wanted to do anything differently, and Peter had been so overwhelmed that he\u2019d just told him to keep doing what he\u2019d been doing before, like with Tony. Occasionally he\u2019d send the man a text asking for a certain series or film, and tried not to think about the fact that it was actually his company. Too big to comprehend.\u00a0\nBut he didn\u2019t think Tony had bought him a private jet\u2026his 18th was coming up though, August 10th, and there was always the possibility. Maybe he could give it to Ned. Peter really didn\u2019t need a plane.\u00a0\nThey tinkered a little bit more with the Lego before Ned encroached another subject. \u201cExcited about the week?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYeah! I think so, it\u2019s not much different to normal, just a couple more meetings. Gotta speak to the board members and stuff on Monday, and then I have the big meeting with the UN that Tony was supposed to go to, about the Accords on Tuesday.\u201d Peter shrugged,\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m a bit nervous for that, I guess. But then I get to come to the field trip on Wednesday\u2014\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWere they okay with that? You taking the day off?\u201d Ned asked, fixing a piece of Lego to the build and glancing at him.\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, and I said if there were any emergencies I would just step out. Honestly, SI doesn\u2019t need a CEO, I just fix problems and make some stuff better occasionally. They\u2019d be perfectly efficient without me there, and both Pepper and Tony know that well enough, so yeah they were fine with it to be honest. I think they just wanted to have a break.\u201d Peter fiddled with the tassels on his hoodie \u2014 or, rather, Tony\u2019s. One time he\u2019d arrived at the lab with just a t-shirt on, and the lab was cold. When Tony saw that Peter was shivering, he\u2019d chucked one of his old hoodies at the teenager without looking at it, and it was his old MIT hoodie. Peter had never given it back.\n\u201cAwesome,\u201d Ned whispered, mostly to himself. They continued to build the magnificent sculpture as it was coming together, and chatted about everything from ideas of where the field trip could be to talking about colleges.\nThere were several things Peter had to do before he could crack on with the day early on Monday morning, having taken inspiration from Pepper\u2019s morning routine, and of course, combining a little bit of Tony in there. Pepper spent at least half an hour in her office reading the news and studying the state of the US economy for fluctuations in order to keep on top of the scandals and the changes in the market. It was apparently useful for business decisions. Peter didn\u2019t like to read, and especially not early in the morning, so he put his own spin on it.\u00a0\nHe\u2019d decided that his way of incorporating that into his day would be to wander into Tony\u2019s lab and start tinkering on one of the suits. It was always good to keep the lab alive whilst Tony was away on holiday \u2014 apparently the bots got lonely if Tony was away too long. Peter could understand that: the lab was kind of lonely without his mentor running around. Then when he was settled in the lab, he had FRIDAY play what was essentially a news reel from all of the semi-trustworthy news presenters of that morning, hearing all the top stories. That was his adaptation of Pepper\u2019s suggestion that he get caught up on current events, and it meant he didn\u2019t have to read anything.\u00a0\nThe final thing to check before Peter could get to work was that Tony had sent in the slip excusing Peter from being in class. Truth be told, Tony did have the signature sorted. A very distinct signature. There was no way anyone could deny that Tony Stark had signed Peter a permission of absence. It was unmissable.\u00a0\nTony had commissioned a paper company to create the largest piece of paper ever made (and yes, he got another Guiness World Record just for that) and wrote the letter on the paper in extremely small writing, and had then signed it it the biggest possible letters. You could see the \u2019T Stark\u2019 signature from the sky, from a plane. The paper covered the entire football field, and there were rumours that Principal Morita had resigned after he saw the second part of the signature, that Tony denied ever having ordered. His eye had twitched when he\u2019d denied it, though. There was, naturally, a plane that had accompanied the paper. Peter never saw the plane, because, of course, he was absent, but Ned had sent him a picture, so now the image of a plane banner reading, \u201cSUCK MY D***\u201d had become a part of Midtown History.\u00a0\nThe great news was, all of the students just thought it was a prank that someone had done just because they knew Morita had issues with Tony Stark. (It had also been rumoured that a day after the meeting Morita had had with Tony &amp; Peter, Morita had purchased a dartboard with Tony\u2019s face on it and stuck it on the inside of his office door. Tony was delighted when he\u2019d heard about it.) So the students of Midtown didn\u2019t bother to read the letter, because they figured it was just an elaborate prank set by some student to enrage Morita.\nThere wasn\u2019t much to say about Monday \u2014 it went smoothly, the board of directors approved of all of the minute changes that had been made since the last meeting. Peter was glad, and went on with his day attending other meetings and sorting out minor issues. He didn\u2019t particularly fancy being almost shot in the head again, so he mainly stuck to \u2018his areas\u2019 of Stark Tower, which basically meant he went in a triangle from his office, to the meeting rooms and to R&amp;D.\u00a0\nHe\u2019d planned to go out as Spiderman every evening, to keep a routine up, which he did on Monday. It kept him fit, the fighting, and even the swinging was pretty good to give him some fresh air. There were a couple of muggings but nothing of significant importance.\u00a0\nTuesday was minorly more eventful. As he\u2019d discussed briefly with Ned, the UN were kicking off again, this time to do with the Accords. It was Tony\u2019s speciality, and Tony who dealt with them. It had been one of the major reasons Tony had been reluctant to go away that week. None of the other Avengers had the balls to speak to the UN in the way Tony did so abrasively to get what he wanted, so Peter had decided to take it over, just for the one meeting. Tony had told him, essentially, to stall. He didn\u2019t want any of the UN\u2019s suggested measures put in place whilst he was on holiday. And Peter was very good at stalling.\u00a0\nOnce he\u2019d taken one of the meetings with the US military and it had lasted four hours because whenever the clients tried to input their ideas (which was essentially just for Stark Industries to make weapons again), Peter would just talk over them about their current contract for energy supplies. He knew all of the energy contracts in enough detail to talk for a very long time. After four hours, of course, the military individuals had gotten frustrated and left, leaving Peter triumphant.\u00a0\nSo stalling was a concept he was very used to, and that was what he did on Tuesday in his meeting with the UN before going out as Spiderman to finish off the evening.\u00a0\nHe\u2019d of course prearranged things so that his surprise field trip would be able to take place without any problems. Peter could control Stark Industries from wherever museum or science institute they found themselves at, even if it did mean he\u2019d have to take a step out every so often to take some calls. Mr Harrington was understanding, and generally oblivious. He wouldn\u2019t ask for context, probably wouldn\u2019t notice Peter slip off if any calls came up.\nWhen Wednesday finally swung around, Peter woke up in the Tower, going through his early morning routine, and thought about skipping the field trip. It was exciting, true, but field trips had never gone very well for him. That one time he\u2019d gotten bitten by a radioactive spider, of course, and then his little incident at Washington. Needless to say, he was a bit on edge. And this one was a mystery \u2014 Peter didn\u2019t like the concept of that.\u00a0\nNed, however, was hyped. He loved surprises, and had spent the entire ride from Midtown babbling at Peter about what he\u2019d missed from the two days of school. Apparently, not much, other than various pieces of school work. The only semi-interesting thing that had happened had been Tony Stark\u2019s signature appearing on the football field, and that had been Monday morning.\u00a0\nPeter had his eyes shut for the duration of the coach ride \u2014 they always made him feel ill. There were just too many sensory inputs - everyone\u2019s conversations, the creaking of the old coach, someone chewing gum several aisles back. It was easier if he took one of those senses away and just shut his eyes. But when he felt the coach pull to a stop and whispers started to circulate, he got tapped in the shoulder extremely rapidly by Ned.\u00a0\n\u201cDude. DUDE.\u201d Peter opened his eyes reluctantly, already ready for the day to be over. When he\u2019d said he\u2019d wanted to go on the field trip, he\u2019d forgotten just how insufferable most of the members of his year group actually were to be around. It was too much, to be trapped in a coach with his Senior year. Flash, too, another issue. He\u2019d sent Peter a warning glare that morning, and Peter did not want to see what Flash had planned for him, not on a field trip like this.\n\u201cWelcome to the destination of your senior field trip \u2014 Stark Industries!\u201d Mr Harrington announced, and Peter shot up in his seat, adjusting to his environment.\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d he whispered, the world crashing around him before his feet. He turned to Ned with a look of horror. His best friend\u2019s face however, was thrilled.\nOf course, Peter knew that Stark Industries offered tours to high schools \u2014 it was part of the HR initiative to attempt to get more people interested in the company, especially youths. Peter had helped with it, explaining things that he thought would appeal to the youths. Hell, Peter had helped plan half of the tour, choosing what interns would do demonstrations for the kids.\u00a0\nAnd yes, he\u2019d known there would be several tours for the week he was in charge \u2014 it had come up in one of the Bulletins FRIDAY had given him. But he hadn\u2019t thought to look at the schools \u2014 he wasn\u2019t expected to interact with the tours, having had a busy week planned around meetings and more important things, aka, not tour groups.\nSo naturally, he hadn\u2019t expected his senior school trip to be to Stark Tower. But of course it was.\u00a0\nHe should have called in sick, both from the field trip and from work. He should have abdicated his position as CEO, if that was a thing CEOs could do. He should have pleaded to fly with Tony and Pepper to their holiday, just to avoid the field trip. He\u2019d known field trips never went well for him.\n\u00a0Shit. The realisation was setting in. His senior year field trip was going to be at what was currently his company. Peter was going to be spending the day touring the building, \u2018meeting\u2019 employees, not as Peter Parker the training CEO, not Peter Parker their boss, but as Peter Parker the high school student.\u00a0\nIn one word, fuck.\u00a0\nThere was a general flurry of excitement as the group got off the coach, but Peter\u2019s emotions were in overdrive. Okay, there was just no way. There was no way this had happened organically. Someone had to have intervened on this. Peter\u2019s mind was turning very quickly, trying his hardest not to go into a panic attack, so he called Tony. He needed to get to the bottom of this.\u00a0\n\u201cPeter!\u201d Tony was grinning, Peter could tell even through the phone, something about the inflection of his voice. He was probably chilling by their pool, drinking out of a coconut. \u201cHow is your morning? It is morning, there, right?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYes, and it\u2019s going bad, Mr Stark! My morning is going very badly,\u201d Peter hissed at his mentor. He was trying to be subtle, sort of whispering into his phone so no-one would hear. He and Ned were at the back of the pack of kids as they walked through the car-park of the Tower, which was fairly vast for the centre of New York.\u00a0\n\u201cDo we need to come back?\u201d Tony sounded worried. \u201cWe can be back in like, 12 hours, tops, if you need me. Or Pepper. Either of us.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNo, stay. It\u2019s um, it\u2019s not really work-related problems.\u201d Peter sighed. \u201cDo you know anything about my field trip? Or um, does Pepper?\u201d He felt bad for asking, but if Tony had arranged this\u2026\n\u201cKid, why would we have anything to do with your field trip?\u201d But Tony sounded genuinely confused. \u201cWhere is it, anyways? You sounded excited, when you asked for the day off, and you must be there by now. Is it worth taking the day off?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cTony \u2014 it\u2019s a tour at Stark Industries.\u201d Peter dropped into first-name basis to complain. The other line was quiet for a moment, stunned into silence, and then Tony burst into laughter.\n\u201cKid \u2014 you have the worst luck, I swear. What?! So your long-awaited, end of high school field trip is\u2014\u201d\nPeter interrupted, still hissing at Tony. \u201cYes, it\u2019s very funny, Tony. I\u2019m about to do a tour of the building that I\u2019m currently CEO of.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWow,\u201d Tony was clearly wiping away tears of laughter, still chuckling. \u201cWait until Pepper hears! Have you seen Happy yet? He\u2019ll be so surprised\u2026oh my god, I said you weren\u2019t in today.\u201d\nHappy would probably see him, but that would be the least of his problems. All of the employees knew him, if not personally, then at least his face. Even wearing a hoodie and jeans, he\u2019d still be reasonably recognisable. \u201cSo did I, Mr Stark. I\u2019m going to have to hide, so people don\u2019t find me out. I know literally 90% of the employees, I\u2019m screwed.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWell, you could just own it.\u201d Tony said. \u201cThe announcement is only in a few weeks, after all. We\u2019d have to get your class to sign NDAs but I\u2019d be okay with it.\u201d\nTrue, Peter could just own it. He could stroll into the building like a boss and be, in fact, the Boss. He could abandon the tour, steal Ned and MJ, and just go and spend the day in the labs doing what he wanted, or something more productive. Something where he wouldn\u2019t run into the tour group. But he\u2019d have to speak to Mr Harrington and explain the situation, and he really, really didn\u2019t want to do that. He didn\u2019t want his class to know, and he definitely didn\u2019t want to see the expression on Flash\u2019s face when it came out that he was, in fact, Peter Parker, CEO of Stark Industries, not Penis Parker, pathetic high school student. In theory, it would be funny seeing Flash\u2019s reaction. But actually? Peter thought he might get decked by Flash if he exposed himself as the actual CEO.\n\u201cNo, Mr Stark, it\u2019s really not worth it. I\u2019ll just\u2026be conspicuous.\u201d Easier said than done.\u00a0\n\u201cGood luck, Kid. If you need anything\u2026\u201d Tony trailed off.\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll ring. Thanks.\u201d \u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got this, kiddo.\u201d Peter hung up, and immediately turned to Ned.\u00a0\n\u201cI need your hat.\u201d Ned had been donning this baseball cap for the past week, non-stop. It was his new favourite hat, black, inconspicuous, and it looked good on everyone. He was extremely attached to it.\u00a0\n\u201cNo, dude!\u201d Ned immediately protested, gripping onto his hat. \u201cThis is my comfort hat, you can\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s life or death, Ned. If any of them find out, I\u2019m screwed.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Ned sighed, and handed over the hat. \u201cBut if you lose it!\u201d It was a weak threat at most: Ned would never do anything to Peter.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u201cI know, I know.\u201d Feeling a little more reassured, Peter put on the hat. That was what all the Avengers did to hide their identity, right? Put on a hat and a hoodie, and pray no-one looked at your face?\nPeter reluctantly entered the Tower with his head down. It was Will at the front desk again, a guy he was fairly well acquainted with. He immediately bee-lined for the employee, trying his best to make it look natural and normal. Mr Harrington was busy talking to the other lady at the front desk, presumably to get their badges and find out where to find the tour guide.\u00a0\nPeter knew how the access system to Stark Tower went. All employees had badges, with their varying access levels encoded into the system. FRIDAY recognised most higher-ups, including him. If Peter forgot his name badge (which he often had) then FRIDAY would simply let him in anyways, same as Tony or Pepper. Trying to get Tony to wear a name badge was futile, anyways.\u00a0\nHis badge, which he had in his bag in case there was an actual emergency mid-field trip (which apparently wouldn\u2019t be a problem anymore because he was actually in the building), was largely irrelevant. It gave him all-access, of course, as the CEO, but he didn\u2019t actually need it.\u00a0\nBut it would flash up with his access code when he went through the sensor, which he didn\u2019t need. No-one from his class besides Ned and probably MJ would believe that Peter had access everywhere as an intern \u2014 hell, they didn\u2019t believe he even had an internship.\u00a0\nSo he went up to Will, cap on, and looked up, making a \u2018shush\u2019 action with his finger. \u201cWill, I need you to do something for me.\u201d Will looked surprised at seeing Peter on his day off, and especially in normal clothes, but responded immediately. God, Peter loved his employees.\u00a0\n\u201cAnything, Boss.\u201d Will hesitated. \u201cAre you\u2026are you undercover?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThis is my school.\u201d Peter gestured to the group subtly. \"They\u2019re doing a tour group and they don\u2019t know anything. I\u2019d like to keep it that way. Let me go last, yeah?\u201d The scanner would still go off, proclaiming his all-access, but if he was last then hopefully less people would pay attention to it.\u00a0\n\u201cSure thing, but I can\u2019t stop the scanner from coming up as all-access for you,\u201d Will warned.\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine. As long as you get them to congregate far away once there through the scanner, no one should pick up on it.\u201d Hopefully it would work.\n\u201cOkay, will do.\u201d Will gave him a thumbs up, \u201cGood luck, Boss.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThanks Will. I\u2019m going to need it.\u201d Peter was disrupted by his teacher.\n\u201cParker, what are you doing?\u201d Mr Harrington scolded him, calling Peter back over to the group. \u201cWe have to listen to this, it\u2019s important stuff about security here.\u201d\u00a0\nWell, Peter thought, he was pretty sure he knew more about security at Stark Tower than Mr Harrington did, but sure. He\u2019d listen to the talk. Will then did his whole speech about how important it was to wear badges at Stark Industries. Peter could attest, at least, to that. It wasn\u2019t worth seeing Happy\u2019s face when he didn\u2019t wear the badge.\u00a0\n\u201cThere\u2019s various levels of access depending on your role here. You guys get temporary access for the day, as you\u2019re on a tour. Different employees get different access,\u201d Will pointed to his badge, \u201cI get medium-access because I work part-time as an intern, part-time down here, but I can\u2019t go into all the departments or the meeting rooms up top. Pepper Potts, for example, would have all-access.\u201d\u00a0\nWill\u2019s eyes flicked to Peter out of habit when he said that, but he immediately shifted away to glance at the sensor. \u201cI\u2019m going to read out your names and you can come and get your badge, then go through the sensor, which will register you, and then if you could please form in a group over by that office there,\u201d Will gestured to the room which the tour guides had adopted as their office, which had previously been a spare room. \u201cYour tour guide will meet you there.\u201d\u00a0\nPeter nodded slightly. Good \u2014 it was a good distance away from the sensor. He should be safe from suspicion.\u00a0\n\u201cOkay. Um, Roger Harrington, if you could go first?\u201d Mr Harrington grabbed his badge with enthusiasm and went through the sensor, which made a beep and stated, \u201cRoger Harrington, Temporary Access.\u201d\u00a0\nWill started off the students in alphabetical order, starting with \u201cBetty Brant?\u201d. Peter, of course, was in the middle of the register, but Will would hold him back, Peter was pretty sure.\u00a0\nPeter hated the school register. Ned and MJ, having similar surnames, were next to each other, so they got to go through the scanner pretty much together. MJ glanced at him before going to pick up her badge.\u00a0\n\n\u201cCool hat, Peter.\u201d She smiled and Ned looked appalled \u2014 of course now it was Peter wearing the hat, people complimented it. Jeez. People these days. Peter smiled back at MJ.\n\u201cMichelle Jones, Temporary Access.\u201d MJ wandered through over to where Mr Harrington had now collected half the class.\u00a0\nNed was buzzing as Will read out his name, and grinned at Peter as he went to collect his badge. Ned had never been to Stark Industries before \u2014 they tended to hang out at either Peter\u2019s apartment or Ned\u2019s place. He kept his work and school life separate, but from Ned\u2019s reaction to just being in the entrance area, he probably should have brought his best friend to the Tower. Peter had the right to, after all, as Boss. And Ned would freak if he saw the personal labs.\u00a0\n\u201cNed Leeds, Temporary Access.\u201d Ned glanced back at Peter, who gave him a thumbs up, and then he went to catch up with MJ.\u00a0\nThere were several other names before Peter\u2019s name should have been called. Because God wanted to smite him, he and Flash were in similar places on the register, so when the name \u201cEugene Thompson,\u201d was called, Flash glared at him with a sentiment of confusion, before turning to Will and picking up his badge. Thankfully, Flash didn\u2019t say anything about Peter being skipped on the register.\u00a0\nMore students pass by, until they reached the end of the register and Will glanced at Peter.\u00a0\n\u201cOh, sorry, Mr Parker, I must have skipped you,\u201d Will said loudly, for the benefit of Flash, who was still near to the sensor, having waited for a friend of his who had the surname Wilson.\nHe crossed his fingers behind his back and closed his eyes as he went through the scanner, waving his \u2018Peter Parker \u2014 CEO in training\u2019 badge at the sensor. \u201cPeter Parker, All Access. Welcome back, Peter.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThanks, FRI,\u201d He whispered, then opened his eyes again. It had worked \u2014 Flash, who was probably just out of hearing distance hadn\u2019t heard a thing. He gave a double thumbs up to Will, who just smiled and returned to his desk. Okay. That problem was out of the way, then. Crisis averted.\u00a0\nThe tour guide had surfaced by the time Peter joined up with the group, shuffling in beside Ned and MJ, hat covering his face. Tour guides varied \u2014 most of them were interns, but some people came from other departments. Either way, he\u2019d need to avoid the tour guide at all cost, or speak to them privately, like he\u2019d done with Will.\u00a0\nIt turned out that the tour guide was Kai, from HR. He was knowledgable about all things Stark Industries and had applied to be a tour guide shortly after the whole Alex incident from Peter\u2019s previous experience as YoungBoss. Peter himself had approved the training, because Kai was nice enough and probably deserved a break after sitting with him and the legal team for about an hour. Personally, Peter didn\u2019t think doing tours would be relaxing, but hey, probably more relaxing than doing interviews of new deputies for Ms Roberts and hoping these ones wouldn\u2019t, in fact, be attempted murderers intent on shutting down the company.\u00a0\nBut hey, every job had its faults.\u00a0\n\u201cHi guys, my name is Kai and I\u2019m your tour guide for today.\u201d Kai waved at them all. \u201cI\u2019m going to be showing you around Stark Industries. The tour will start with showing you the Arc Reactor, the pride and joy of Stark Industries, then we\u2019ll move onto the museum, etc etc.\u201d\u00a0\nThe class collectively nodded and started whispering.\u00a0\n\u201cRight, let\u2019s make a move then! Oh, and if anyone has any questions then feel free to ask me.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cDude,\u201d Ned grinned at Peter, whispering. \u201cThis is so cool. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re the CEO right now, that\u2019s actually crazy.\u201d\nPeter raised his eyes in alarm, glancing around them. MJ was walking slightly ahead. She knew about the internship, but she was under the impression that he was still only one of the most important interns, who worked personally with Mr Stark (Peter had accidentally let that one slip). But he\u2019d decided he wasn\u2019t going to mention the whole, well, heir thing to her until just before the announcement. The less people who knew the better \u2014 MJ had probably figured it out anyways.\u00a0\n\u201cVolume!\u201d Peter reminded Ned. \u201cBut yeah, it\u2019s pretty crazy.\u201d He tried to look at the corridors like someone who\u2019d never seen them would. It probably would be cool to someone who hadn\u2019t worked there for multiple years, but hey. Peter had seen the inside of Tony\u2019s lab, the Avengers compound and even Bruce Banner\u2019s personal lab. Nothing could quite compare to seeing stuff like that.\u00a0\nThe Arc Reactor was largely self-sufficient. Technically, it did keep the Tower going with the electricity it produced, but there were several others, smaller ones, like the one in Tony\u2019s suits, that did more to keep the building running. But the larger arc reactor, before Tony started to work on miniaturised ones, was more impressive, which was why it had been left at the bottom of the Tower. It was like a piece of history of Stark Industries.\u00a0\nKai did a talk about the history of the arc reactor and what it did for the building. Peter was itching to explain that it was actually not that efficient as it had been advertised, and in fact was very much too big to still have at the company. But size meant power to a lot of people, so Peter left it. Besides, he was supposed to be under the radar.\u00a0\nAfter about fifteen minutes of wonder and general awe from his classmates, Kai decided to move them along, and so they left the Arc Reactor behind.\u00a0\n\u201cNext, we have the Stark Industries Museum,\u201d Kai informed them when they were several floors up. Now, Peter knew about the Museum, but he\u2019d never actually visited it. He knew it contained such things as old Avengers weapons and suits, when Tony didn\u2019t have anywhere else to put them. He also knew that the Museum showcased several of Stark Industries\u2019 inventions, but he\u2019d never been too interested in the history of it all. Everything he needed to know, he knew.\u00a0\nPeter underestimated the Museum. He thought it would have been just a small room with various displays, but it had to be the size of a fairly large conference room, actually. One one wall, there was the Avengers display, which had an array of Iron Man suits, from a replica of the first one up to some of the more recent ones, which was pretty cool. And \u2014 wait.\u00a0\nThere was one of the old Spiderman suits on the wall \u2014 the one he\u2019d fought Captain America with. Holy shit, that was where it had gone! Tony had given him a replacement without commenting on it, but it had ended up here? In the museum? That was so cool. He and Ned immediately beelined for it.\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s so cool, man,\u201d Ned whispered at him. \u201cYou\u2019re in a museum!\u201d\nIt was pretty cool. They wandered along the display, seeing all of the Avengers various weapons and Peter would occasionally point at something and give an anecdote of a time he\u2019d fixed them in the lab \u2014 like one of Hawkeye\u2019s bows, or the Falcon wings.\u00a0\nAnd then, of course, the main attraction, the History of Iron Man display.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy how big the suits used to be,\u201d One of his classmates commented as they stared at the first ever Iron Man suit, which was technically a replica because obviously Obadiah Stane had wrecked the first one. \u201cI\u2019ve heard Tony Stark gets his suit from a watch now.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNanotechnology,\u201d Another commented. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d\u00a0\nPeter uncomfortably shifted his own watch on his wrist, which had a back up Spiderman suit in it, just in case. As Tony\u2019s technology had worked so well for his suit, they\u2019d figured out how to make a replica of the Iron Spider suit for the watch. It was a more recent change, but it was a much more functional watch than say, a Rolex.\nThere was also a full display showing the history of Starkphones, back from when Howard had initially designed a phone which looked like a brick in comparison to the modern Starkphones. Peter wandered over to have a look at how they progressed over the years. It was pretty cool, because he could compare it to the most recent version, which wasn\u2019t even out to the general public yet.\u00a0\n\u201cThe Starkphone XI is being released in like three months, right?\u201d Betty asked Kai. \u201cI\u2019ve heard it\u2019s supposed to have some super cool features on it.\u201d It was four months, actually, Peter mentally corrected. The new Starkphone was beyond any of the others the company had created, and Peter was pretty proud of it because of some of his contributions.\u00a0\n\u201cYes, and I might know a bit about that,\u201d Kai grinned, \u201cBut I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m sworn to secrecy until they showcase the next phone.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cDo you have one?\u201d Flash asked Kai, \u201cDo the employees get Starkphones?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNo, employees don\u2019t get the newest gen for free, but we do get a significant discount and we get a free Starkphone from an older gen. We\u2019ve had issues with employees selling their new Starkphones, so the initiative had to be stopped. Now the phones are kept until the release date \u2014 almost no one gets a copy of the new phone.\u201d\u00a0\nIronically, Peter\u2019s phone buzzed in his pocket at that point, and it felt like it was burning a hole in his trousers. Of course, he had a copy of the newest generation, the Starkphone XI, as did Tony and Pepper. No-one could know that he had one, of course, but it was pretty cool, with the hologram feature for calling people.\u00a0\nHe moved away from the History of Starkphones to look at some of the smaller inventions. There was a display on the wall, with light boxes showing the inventions on a large time-line from the creation of the company. Peter wandered along, staring at some of Howard\u2019s inventions and all of the ones that were credited in Tony\u2019s name. It was cool to see the diversity in inventions after 2008, when it shifted from mainly weapons to a wider range of industries. It went straight from, \u2018The Jericho Missile, 2008\u2019 to \u2018The Miniaturised Arc Reactor, 2008\u2019.\u00a0\nPeter\u2019s eyes went wide when he got to the end of the timeline \u2014 his medical bandaging was there, amongst all of the other things he had worked on, and he was credited for them. Holy shit, he\u2019d had no idea he was in the museum, not even as Spiderman but also as Peter Parker.\u00a0\nPeter glanced around. All of the most recent inventions had been credited with the names of several of the interns, but also tacked on the end was his initials, his surname. P.Parker, even ones he\u2019d only helped on just slightly. Wow, that was so cool.\u00a0\nAfter many of the students marvelled at the wonders of the Iron Man suits, and posed for photos with them (including Ned, despite having actually met Tony Stark before). Peter abstained from any photos: he spent his days working with the new and improved versions of the suits \u2014 hell, he\u2019d even flown one before. He didn\u2019t need a photo with them. But he did get a nice selfie with Ned and MJ, which he made a mental note to print out at some point. It was one for the scrapbook.\u00a0\n\u201cNext, we\u2019ll go to the canteen so you guys can get some lunch,\u201d Kai informed them, \u201cIt\u2019s on this floor.\u201d\u00a0\nThe elevator took them down to the correct floor, and the class collectively followed Kai and\u00a0 wandered along the corridor to the canteen. Kai stopped at a very familiar door\u2026\n\u201cWell, as we\u2019re close, I guess we should go into the Comfort Room. This was a recent decision by um,\u201d Kai paused, realising the public didn\u2019t know about Peter being CEO yet, \u201cA\u2026person in charge, who decided that the company needed to hire a private therapist. According to him, this room just \u2018happened\u2019.\u201d\u00a0\nThe comfort room was one of Peter\u2019s pride and joy areas of Stark Industries, and it was nice to see the collective excitement of his class when they saw it. If R&amp;D was Peter\u2019s baby of sorts, then this area had to be his niece or nephew. It had blossomed over the time since Peter had constructed it, and was now a fully-fledged room. The therapist, Emily, was actually in a session when the tour group entered the room, but his classmates appreciated the room itself.\u00a0\nBetty crowded around the fishbowl and began to peek at the fish, which had all been named after the Avenger their colour scheme matched. Peter was particularly proud as he could identify each fish by name, but they didn\u2019t like him as much as they liked Emily. Several other students gravitated to the beanbags.\nFlash, however, centred around the Playstation Peter had had installed. \u201cThis is a PS6,\u201d Flash glanced at the system, \u201cHow?!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re Stark Industries,\u201d Kai said, and didn\u2019t elaborate. Peter grinned. The company got special compensation for gaming systems and new technology, which Peter had taken advantage of to get the earliest adaptation of the new PlayStation system. They\u2019d actually produced a game about superheroes, which was pretty cool \u2014 but not as cool as actually swinging through New York itself.\u00a0\n\u201cDude,\u201d Ned punched him lightly, \u201cThis is awesome.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Peter smiled back. It was nice to be acknowledged for his handiwork.\u00a0\nEventually they did arrive at the canteen area. Peter didn\u2019t expect a range of gasps when the group arrived in the Stark Industries canteen, but he guessed it was a group of teenager\u2019s heaven: a bunch of random fast food places gathered in one open location. Like a mall, in a company building. Peter didn\u2019t care for a burger or a pizza \u2014 he always had and always would get his sandwich for lunch, so whilst the group dispersed to get their free lunch, he went straight for Delmar\u2019s, Ned following.\u00a0\nMr Delmar\u2019s son recognised him immediately and gave him a thumbs up before Peter even had to order. \u201cI\u2019ve got it, kid. Don\u2019t even worry.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWow,\u201d Ned muttered. \u201cYou\u2019re friends with the cafeteria guy as well. Is there anyone you don\u2019t know?\u201d\u00a0\nPeter chuckled. \u201cProbably. Um, what are you going to get for food?\u201d\u00a0\nNed stared at all of the shops and focused on a pizza joint. \u201cI might go and grab a pizza. Meet you at one of the tables?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter nodded. \u201cI\u2019m, uh, going to sit down by the table over there. To be conspicuous, y\u2019know. Avoid the employees.\u201d\u00a0\nThe younger Delmar chucked Peter his sandwich and Peter settled himself alone at the table which faced the wall, eating his sandwich peacefully for several moments before he was interrupted. There was a shadow that loomed over him suddenly, and from the footsteps and the breathing pattern, Peter deduced it was Happy. He kept his back turned to the wall, though. Damn, he really hadn\u2019t wanted to explain this to Happy.\u00a0\n\u201cExcuse me, can I see your badge?\u201d Happy said with an air of slight menace, clearly not knowing who he was and Peter smiled. The Head of Security was always on the look out for someone who didn\u2019t belong.\u00a0\n\u201cHappy, chill, it\u2019s just me,\u201d Peter turned his head and lifted up the hat a bit, whispering. Happy\u2019s eyebrows shot up.\n\u201cPeter?\u201d Happy was incredulous. \u201cWhat are you doing here? Aren\u2019t you supposed to be on your field trip?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI am on my field trip,\u201d Peter explained, much to Happy\u2019s confusion. \u201cThe field trip is here, so now I\u2019m hiding from all of my employees so I don\u2019t get exposed to my class.\u201d\u00a0\nHappy\u2019s face contorted in the way that only Happy\u2019s face could do. It was his attempt to keep a serious face, but he couldn\u2019t stop his mouth from twitching with laughter. He chuckled.\u00a0\n\u201cGod, you\u2019re as bad as Tony,\u201d Peter complained, pulling down his hat so it covered his face. The whole situation was so embarrassing.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, kid, but that is quite funny,\u201d Happy smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re not really very lucky, are you?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d Peter sighed. \u201cI guess not.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWell, is there anything I can do for you, to facilitate your day, Mr CEO?\u201d There were many things Happy could do: he could drive Peter far far away from the building, or escort Flash out of the Tower, or just take Peter\u2019s place and pretend to be him for the rest of the day whilst Peter hid out in the comfort of his lab. But none of it was actually possible, not really.\u00a0\n\u201cNo, Happy,\u201d Peter readjusted his hat. \u201cI\u2019m alright.\u201d\nHappy gave his best wishes and continued to interrogate Peter\u2019s classmates for their badges. Ned finally arrived, his pizza looking extremely tasty and they continued with their lunch in peace. Peter let Ned rant about the museum.\u00a0\nIt was Peter\u2019s fault that the next stop on their tour was Research and Development, which Kai announced with a smile when everyone had finished their lunch. After all, when the HR department had asked him what part of the company he found the most interesting as a teenager, he\u2019d been the one to say the intern labs.\u00a0\nSo maybe it was karma that Peter\u2019s fingers were itching to move when they got to R&amp;D. His favourite department, and cruelly, he couldn\u2019t do anything. These were the employees that knew him most, knew him best. If he spoke, or got involved in any of the demonstrations, they would instantly know who he was. That recognition would prove his involvement at Stark. It would have been fine, if they treated him just like any of the other interns, but they\u2019d collectively all shifted to calling him Boss rather than Peter, and a situation in which Peter quite clearly, by name, outranked the other interns wasn\u2019t one he wanted to explain to his class.\u00a0\nBut Research &amp; Development was Peter\u2019s baby, and he wanted Ned to at least enjoy some of the demos, so he told Ned to go off by himself and investigate Peter\u2019s workplace. Peter, in turn, pretended to look interested in one of the displays about medical bandaging \u2014 something that he\u2019d actually personally developed, as it turned out his chemical mix for his webs was reasonably helpful in the medical field. He wasn\u2019t interested in the bandaging, and would have preferred to be talking to Jasper, who was doing the robot demo, but needs must. He had identities to protect \u2014 and this wasn\u2019t even about his typical secret identity.\u00a0\n\u201cSo,\u201d came the voice of the one and only Eugene \u2018Flash\u2019 Thompson, and Peter jumped. Peter had kept at the back of the group, as the others had gone up to interns to ask them questions. Flash, of course, had decided to finally turn his attention to Peter, after having been largely tame for the day, probably because it was the first time he\u2019d been properly alone all day. Peter should have known the blissful lack of attention from his least favourite human wouldn\u2019t last. \u201cWhere\u2019s your desk, Penis?\u201d\u00a0\nIt was obviously an attempt to call him out, but it wasn\u2019t going to work. Flash knew about the internship, because Peter proclaimed the fact he had an internship at Stark fairly openly, not that Flash believed him. Flash had spent most of the last three years purely making Peter\u2019s life miserable with names, insults and the occasional shove when he didn\u2019t give the reaction Flash wanted. Of course he would wait until they got to what was essentially the Intern Headquarters before beginning to torment him about his job.\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a desk, Flash.\u201d Peter had an office, and well, the whole building, technically, but no desk. In the Intern department, he tended to just co-opt other people\u2019s desks. Okay, true, he did have his own little desk in Tony\u2019s lab, for smaller projects, but most of the time they collaborated on one work surface. Tony had tried to get Peter his own personal lab, but Peter had rejected it. He didn\u2019t like working on his own: he couldn\u2019t do long hours listening to blasting rock music like Tony could, even in the early hours of the morning. It would drive him crazy, having his own space, so he\u2019d stuck to basically living in Tony\u2019s lab space, hence the small desk there.\u00a0\n\u201cSo you don\u2019t work here?\u201d Flash scoffed, staring at Jasper\u2019s demonstration. The bot, which had affectionately been named SIR (the interns were very creative, it stood for Stark Industries Robot \u2014 boring. At least Tony had some individuality with JARVIS and FRIDAY). \u201cI knew it.\u201d\u00a0\nPeter looked at the floor. \u201cI do work here,\u201d Peter clenched his jaw, \u201cI don\u2019t have a desk here, Flash. You\u2019re not going to believe me, but I do work here.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cGo and join them, Penis\u00a0 If you actually work here,\u201d Flash taunted him. \u201cThey should welcome you with open arms, right?\u201d\u00a0\nPeter was tired of it. They had a month of school left, and Flash was still at it. Seriously, three weeks and then he would never see Flash again. He was certainly never going to get an internship at SI, not when Peter was in charge, not even if he was their best applicant.\u00a0\n\u201cNot today, Flash. Please.\u201d The day had already been hard enough without Flash tormenting him. Peter went to move away from Flash, planning on finding Ned at the robot demo, risking Jasper seeing him, but Flash grabbed his arm and twisted it, smirking. Peter winced.\u00a0\n\u201cIf you want me to believe you work here, you\u2019ll go and work with your supposed colleagues, Penis.\u201d Peter tried to shake Flash\u2019s arm off, still pointedly glaring at the floor. God, he\u2019d love to just have Flash booted out of the building. One text to Happy\u2026.\n\u201cLet go of him,\u201d came a familiar voice, and no this could not be happening, not now, not here. But it was. Peter looked in the mirror of the display and saw Lisa, Intern Head, with crossed arms and staring pointedly at Flash. Peter gulped and turned his head away. Lisa hadn\u2019t seen his face, and if he played this well, he could keep it that way.\u00a0\nFlash dropped Peter\u2019s arm like it was made of ice.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat did you just call that kid?\u201d Lisa asked Flash, clearly appalled. \u201cYou are aware we have a very strict no-bullying policy here, kid. What\u2019s your name?\u201d\nFlash looked at the floor, and scuffed one of his shoes on the floor, ignoring Lisa. Peter desperately looked at the floor too, attempting to retain his identity. It had attracted the attention of lots of the interns \u2014 Peter could feel the attention on him. He could even hear Flash\u2019s heartbeat, which was racing from being publicly called out. Peter\u2019s was also beating quickly: he\u2019d been doing so well all day, of fucking course Flash would be the one to put a spanner in the works.\u00a0\nAnd he\u2019d been thinking, that just for a second, it would all go well.\u00a0\n\u201cEugene Thompson,\u201d Kai said, looking down at his list. \u201cOr Flash, as the kid likes to call himself.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWell, Eugene, I think you need to give your classmate an apology.\u201d Lisa paused, turned to look at Peter, who was avoiding her. \u201cWho are you, kid?\u201d\u00a0\nShit, shit, shit. Well there was no getting out of this one, was there? He had no choice: either belt it out of there and get security called on him, or reveal himself. And he didn\u2019t want to be the object of a Stark-Industries wide manhunt. Game was up.\u00a0\nPeter reluctantly pulled Ned\u2019s hat off his head and turned to face the group. There was a collective gasp from several of the employees, their faces shocked, and people started to whisper among themselves.\u00a0\nPeter wanted to close his eyes again.\u00a0\n\u201cBoss?\u201d Jasper stepped off the demonstration platform, leaving the robot behind. Mr Harrington glanced at Jasper with a look of surprise. Of course, Jasper just had to call him Boss. Peter should have disappeared for the duration of the R&amp;D section. He wanted to crawl away and hide in a hole. No, seriously, this wasn\u2019t fair. There had to be something up with fate, there was no way all of his field trips could end up in disaster.\u00a0\nPeter had, singlehandedly, managed to surprise every single person in the room, great.\u00a0\n\u201cHi guys,\u201d He smiled in pain. \u201cIt was supposed to be my day off, but, well\u2026.\u201d He trailed off. What was there to say? There were no words.\u00a0\n\u201cPeter\u2026\u201d Lisa had had trouble processing, clearly. \u201cWhy on earth would you put up with this behaviour?!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cLisa, please, it\u2019s really not a big deal, honestly.\u201d He wanted to downplay it as best as possible. Peter had it handled, it was just Flash. He was used to it.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty big deal, Boss, from what we just saw,\u201d Jasper was the most oblivious person ever. Great, that was twice his classmates have heard Peter being called Boss by someone obviously much older than him. Shit shit shit. This wasn\u2019t good.\n\u201cJasper, please,\u201d Peter scrunched his eyes tight, then let out a breath. \u201cReally, it\u2019s nothing. I can handle it.\u201d\u00a0\nLisa started speaking again. \u201cPeter, you can\u2019t just let him walk around yo\u2014\u201d Your building, Peter knew how that one ended. It was like the entire R&amp;D department just assumed his senior class knew everything, like he\u2019d be friends with everyone.\u00a0\n\u201cLisa.\u201d Peter cut her off, and Mr Harrington\u2019s mouth fell open in shock from his sharp tone. Right, he was a 17 year old abrasively going over an authority figure who was much older than him. \u201cI\u2019ve got it handled.\u201d\u00a0\nHe turned to look at Flash. He\u2019d had enough.\u00a0\n\u201cLook at me, Flash.\u201d Flash reluctantly looked up.\u00a0\n\u201cI could get other people to tell you that you\u2019re a bully. Mr Harrington, Principal Morita, even Lisa, but I don\u2019t think I need to. I know bullies, Flash, and I\u2019m sure you have some motivation, some reason. I\u2019m aware of that, sympathetic even, that you feel the need to use violence. But it doesn\u2019t excuse it.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Flash muttered. Wow, the first apology he\u2019d ever given Peter.\u00a0\n\u201cI wish we could have worked past this before the end of our high school career, but clearly you don\u2019t get it. One apology in three years of bullying, three years of insults, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not just me. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s mainly because the school turns a blind eye to this sort of thing, and clearly you\u2019ve never had anyone to tell you that it\u2019s wrong, to do what you do to me, and probably to other people. But I\u2019ve had enough, so I\u2019m,\u201d Peter bit his lip, \u201cI\u2019m going to have to suspend your tour.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cPeter,\u201d Mr Harrington said gently. \u201cI know you\u2019re frustrated, and it\u2019s clear that you do, in fact, work here, but you can\u2019t kick him out of the building.\u201d\u00a0\nLisa chuckled cruelly. \u201cOh yes, he can.\u201d\u00a0\nSo there was no hope for it, then. As Tony had told him, he\u2019d have to own it, be proud of his role. And that wasn\u2019t hard, because Peter was proud of it. So, he dropped his quiet student demeanour and switched to his work one.\u00a0\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to do this, but I guess I have to.\u201d Peter made brief eye contact with some of his classmates. \u201cSo, I work here, obviously. You know that, but there\u2019s a bit more to it. You\u2019ll need to sign NDAs for this but, um\u2026\u201d Peter clicked some of his fingers. \u201cI\u2019m training to be the next CEO, and I\u2019m currently in charge of the whole building because Pepper and Tony are on holiday. So yes, Mr Harrington, actually I can get Flash out of the building if I want to.\u201d\u00a0\nThis was, of course, no surprise to the employees, who all had supportive looks on their faces as their Boss basically just shut down his own teacher. Oh god, Peter just pretty much went off at Mr Harrington. And fuck, he just called Pepper and Tony by their first names in front of all of these people, what a car crash!\nThe revelation was, however, a surprise to his class and teacher. No one fainted, but several jaws dropped, not including Ned and MJ, who both had small smiles on their faces. Of course MJ knew already, despite not being told. Peter wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she confronted him the next day to ask if he was actually Spiderman. Ned gave Peter a thumbs up.\u00a0\nMr Harrington seemed to be in a state of shock, standing perfectly still and staring at him dead in the eyes, as though the idea that one of his students who he\u2019d taught for years was now the CEO of a company. Peter could understand. He\u2019d, after all, fainted when Tony had told him.\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, right,\u201d Flash scoffed quietly in the corner, and Peter turned to him.\u00a0\n\u201cHave a look, if you want.\u201d And if he said it with a bit of malice, then fair enough. He thrust his \u2018Peter Parker - CEO-in-training\u2019 badge at Flash, who shook his head in disbelief. Peter was watching as Flash\u2019s life was falling apart before his eyes.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Mr Harrington came out of his shock and stepped forward, taking the badge from Flash.\n\u201cMy badge,\u201d Peter said. \u201cAny of these employees will corroborate the story. I\u2019m not a liar, Mr Harrington.\u201d\u00a0\nMr Harrington\u2019s eyebrows raised in disbelief.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll testify to it being true. Peter\u2019s the Boss. He has been all week, and he\u2019s great. He\u2019s done so many things for this company, and I\u2019m not just talking about the inventions.\u201d Jasper stated, a grin on his face. Peter sent him a death glare \u2014 he wasn\u2019t fishing for compliments, just someone to back up his story.\nFlash looked like he was going to faint.\nLisa followed suit, \u201cHe started out as Mr Stark\u2019s personal intern, then he became intern director, and now he\u2019s about to take the position of joint CEO. Trust me when I tell you, he\u2019s invaluable. Any one of us would happily write a college reference for him, but he\u2019s already got certain people to do that for him.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWho did you get to give you a college recommendation?\u201d Betty Brant asked, and Peter felt his face reddening. But he couldn\u2019t exactly lie, could he?\u00a0\n\u201cUm, Mr Stark.\u201d Betty\u2019s eyebrows raised, as did several of his classmates. It hadn\u2019t actually set in, if Peter was really thinking about it. The truth of how crazy it was that Tony Stark, Iron Man, the smartest man alive, probably, had written Peter\u2019s college recommendation without Peter even asking. As though it had been the most important thing on his to-do list. It\u2019s never too early to start looking at colleges. I\u2019ve got some pull at MIT. That was one of the first things Tony had said to him, and it had rung true. Peter had, after all, been attending MIT lectures for months. He\u2019d practically completed the first year of his degree, which would fast track his return to SI after college.\u00a0\n\u201cAnd Miss Potts and Dr Banner, and Captain Rogers,\u201d Jasper added. \u201cDon\u2019t sell yourself short, Pete.\u201d More of his classmates started to whisper among themselves and he could feel his face going even more red. But anyways, that wasn\u2019t the point of announcing himself.\u00a0\nHe could kick Flash out of the building. He was in his right to \u2014 it was his building, his rules. Flash had tormented him for years, caused him more suffering than many of the villains he\u2019d fought as Spiderman. Flash Thompson was the bane of his existence\u2026and yet.\u00a0\nThere was a but. Because if he kicked Flash out of the building, it was just retaliation. Peter didn\u2019t want this to be a petty fight, like going back and forth. He didn't want to use his power as the CEO to kick a kid out of the building. It seemed like an abuse of his power.\u00a0\n\u201cFlash,\u201d Peter bit his lip. \u201cAgainst my better judgement, I\u2019m going to let you stay, on the promise that from here on out, you\u2019ll leave me alone. And won\u2019t pick on anyone else. Do we have a deal?\u201d\u00a0\nThat provoked a reaction from the employees. Some frowned, but Peter knew it was the right thing to do. It wouldn\u2019t do to punish Flash \u2014 even after how much Flash had punished him. Retaliation wasn\u2019t worth it. Flash nodded.\u00a0\nLisa touched him on the shoulder. \u201cAre you sure, Peter?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, Lisa. It\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d He whispered back. \u201cAlright, people, back to your demonstrations.\u201d\nThey spent another half an hour in Research and Development. Peter himself did some of the demonstrations to his classmates, and then wandered around helping some of the other interns, watching as his peers freaked out at him interacting with all of the interns, completely at ease. He was in his element.\nWhen the group was finished with all the wonders of Research and Development, Peter moved them on their way. \u201cOkay, Kai, let\u2019s go!\u201d Peter smiled. Okay, maybe this was going to be fun. He could answer questions, help the tour, basically show off to everyone. Maybe it had been a good call, to reveal himself to them.\u00a0\nSlowly, as they walked the corridors, Peter discussed several things with Kai. Most of his classmates didn\u2019t understand what they were talking about \u2014 something about hiring a new deputy, after the last one had \u2018gone wrong\u2019?\u00a0\n\u201cNow, most tours wouldn\u2019t have this privilege, but because you guys are with me, I\u2019m going to allow it,\u201d Peter said, smiling, as he went into the elevator, \u201cWe\u2019re going to see a couple of the personal labs.\u201d\u00a0\nHe planned to show them Bruce\u2019s lab, because it was so cool and would totally please the chemistry students, and maybe even Tony\u2019s.\u00a0\nBruce\u2019s lab was almost as cool as Tony\u2019s. Whilst Tony\u2019s was more focused around engineering, with scrap projects and pieces of metal everywhere, Bruce\u2019s was largely more chemical based. Of course, he had a whole section of the lab dedicated to studies of radioactivity, but Peter\u2019s favourite was the wall of the periodic table, where Bruce stored the various chemicals, normally in their elemental form if it was safe (and if not, then a compound of some sort), in their correct place on the table.\u00a0\nThe class awed and gasped as they saw some of the experiments that were taking place \u2014 Bruce wasn\u2019t in the lab, but he often left experiments ongoing, as some of them took days to form a reaction, which greatly amused the class.\u00a0\n\u201cNo photos here,\u201d Peter quickly added, as he saw people getting out their phones. \u201cIt\u2019ll go in your NDA.\u201d\u00a0\nTony\u2019s lab was on one of the highest floors, and so Peter asked FRIDAY to take them there, overstepping the boundaries of the temporary passes his classmates had been given. Peter didn\u2019t let them go in Tony\u2019s lab, but he did point out several things. Tony had at least cleaned up his lab before he\u2019d gone on holiday. DUMM-E and U, Tony\u2019s two bots, were sat sadly, without anyone to entertain.\nMany of his classmates asked him details about certain things in Tony\u2019s lab, and Peter was more than happy to elaborate, as well as give them some stories about projects gone wrong in the lab.\u00a0\nAfter the labs, the next stop, according to Kai, was a talk at A&amp;P, where one of the team would be giving them a talk about the Starkphones. Peter knew it would interest several of the more engineering focused classmates, so he was going to accompany them to their talk.\u00a0\nBut, alas, duty called. His phone rang, the screen display coming up with a number he vaguely recognised but didn\u2019t want to believe was true. Not today, of all days.\n\u201cAre you fucking kidding me,\u201d Peter muttered as he looked at his phone, sparking concern from Ned, who glanced at his friend. \u201cFRIDAY?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Vice President, Peter, I\u2019m afraid. I think he wants to change your mind about the military weapons supply, again.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThe Vice President?!\u201d One of his classmates said, stunned. Peter ignored the surprise.\u00a0\n\u201cChristttt, I was hoping to go six months before hearing his voice again,\u201d Peter complained. The rest of the class looked shocked, but hey, there weren\u2019t that many more surprises he could give. Him calling the Vice President was probably one of the minor reveals he\u2019d made today. \u201cRight, guys, I have to take this call unfortunately, but I\u2019ll be back in five. Kai \u2014 I\u2019ll meet you back down at A&amp;P, Dr Walters will be there waiting!\u201d\nKai nodded, and went to lead away the tour group back into the elevator. Peter accepted the call and began to pace around the room.\u00a0\n\u201cMr Adams, I was under the impression we had an agreement,\u201d The class heard Peter hiss as the elevator doors closed.\u00a0\nIt turned out the Vice President had wanted to call with him not to be a pain in the ass, but more so to inform Peter that the President was looking to talk to one of the CEOs ASAP. Peter deliberated taking the call, and then told the Vice President that he was actually off-duty and would get back to the President the next day, feeling extremely cool as he did so. After that, he got FRIDAY to speed him down to the Assembly and Production unit.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat did the Vice President want?\u201d Ned asked boldly when Peter arrived.\n\u201cOh, you know,\u201d Peter waved vaguely, \u201cHe wanted me to talk to the President, but I told him I\u2019d do it tomorrow.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYou told the Vice President,\u201d Ned paused, taking it in, \u201cThat couldn\u2019t speak to the actual President because you\u2019re busy?!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWell, I do have a field trip to help lead,\u201d Peter grinned. Ned punched him in the arm.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201d MJ proclaimed. \u201cBut also, that\u2019s iconic.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Tony would\u2019ve done the same thing.\u201d Really, that\u2019s why he did it. He essentially hung up on the President. Tony would find that hilarious.\u00a0\nThe class thoroughly enjoyed the talk from Dr Walters, who was more than happy to answer their burning questions about the Starkphones. Kai looked relieved that he didn\u2019t have to answer any more questions, and could instead just sit and listen to the talk.\nAnd after that, it was time for the tour group to leave \u2014 well, they had one more thing to do. After sitting all of the students and Mr Harrington down with Andrew Maguire, Head of the Legal team, Peter calmly explained to them what an NDA was and what it entailed.\n\u201cListen to me, all of you. This applies verbally, in writing, and even on social media. If my lawyers get one hint that someone has leaked this on Twitter \u2014 even anonymously \u2014 then there will be serious repercussions. Honestly, I\u2019d prefer we didn\u2019t have to do this, and it really wasn\u2019t what I was intending from today, but hey. Shit happens.\u201d\u00a0\nPeter passed out the papers and watched as everyone signed them. He then got Maguire to take them back up to Legal and put them in storage.\u00a0\n\u201cPlease, guys. I know it just seems like a bit of paper to you, but this is my life. If anyone of you say anything,\u201d Peter made eye contact with several of them, \u201cIt will get bad, and people will probably come asking for an interview with you. I can\u2019t force you not to do it, but I am asking you all to say no. After graduation we\u2019re making this go public, but I implore you, please stay away from the press. One of them nearly shot me once,\u201d Peter witnessed as several faces turned extremely alarmed and he immediately backtracked \u201c\u2026but we probably shouldn\u2019t go there. Um. Yeah. Please take care of yourselves.\u201d\u00a0\nPeter escorted them to the exit of Stark industries, waving a hand to Will. He leaned on the doorframe as Mr Harrington beckoned him to come with the rest of the tour group.\u00a0\n\u201cYou have to come back to school with us, Peter,\u201d Mr Harrington stated, gesturing with his hand towards the coach.\n\u201cMr Harrington, with all due respect, then I would just have to get the Head of Security to come and pick me up, to drive me back here.\u201d Peter winced. \u201cI really really don\u2019t want to make him annoyed on a Wednesday evening.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026living here? At the Tower?\u201d Somehow, Peter\u2019s teacher was still surprised by the revelations, even though it was a fairly obvious deduction from Peter\u2019s decision to stay at the Tower.\n\u201cYup!\u201d Peter said, pointing up to the top of the tower. \u201cIn the penthouse. I\u2019m working here this week, so we figured it made more sense than staying in Queens. Someone has to feed the fish in the evening, as well, so.\u201d He shrugged, like it was normality, and it was becoming that. The penthouse was his second home.\n\u201cDo\u2026do you live here all the time? I thought\u2014 who is your Guardian?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I live with my aunt normally and she\u2019s one of my guardians, but I live here occasionally, when I want to, or when it\u2019s more convenient, I guess. And well\u2026 Mr Stark is the other guardian. Um, didn\u2019t you see the paper on the field? That was uh,\u201d Peter scratched the back of his neck, \u201cMy permission slip for the week off, I guess.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cRight,\u201d Mr Harrington said, dazed. \u201cWell, I guess it doesn\u2019t make sense for you to come back with us, after you\u2019ve explained it like that.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cPerfect,\u201d Peter said, doling out a false smile. \u201cI\u2019ll see you all on Monday. Take care.\u201d It was like he was kicking them out of his house after spending the evening entertaining and cooking dinner for them. That was actually what it felt like, too, when Peter closed the door and let out a loud sigh.\u00a0\n\u201cThat bad, boss?\u201d Will demanded, logging off from his computer.\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t even ask, Will,\u201d Peter ran a hand over his face. \u201cDon\u2019t even ask.\u201d \u00a0\nPeter made his way back up to the Tower and collapsed on the sofa. He pulled his phone out and called Tony. He didn\u2019t even know what time it would be where Tony was, but hell. The man was probably awake.\u00a0\n\u201cHeya, kiddo. How are you doing?\u201d Tony asked.\u00a0\n\u201cEh, I\u2019ve been better.\u201d Peter put Tony on speakerphone and rested the phone on his chest. He then put a hand over his face.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\u201cI had to tell them. I don\u2019t wanna talk about it, but they all signed NDAs.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cAh, I\u2019m sorry, tesoro. I know you didn\u2019t wanna have to do that,\u201d That was another new development: Tony had started using Italian nicknames. Tesoro, Bambino. It was a bit like Tony calling him \u2018my kid\u2019, it made Peter feel all warm inside. Tony was just such a dad.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Peter smiled. \u201cThey were going to have to find out eventually. It was just embarrassing. I thought I could have gotten away with just being an intern, but Jasper kept calling me Boss, so that plan went out of the way.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m proud of you. Did the rest of it go smoothly? Did you like the museum?!\u201d Tony clearly was grinning at that.\u00a0\n\u201cI had no idea my suit was in there, it was so cool!\u201d The pair spoke a bit more about the day \u2014 Tony found it hilarious that Peter had put the President himself on hold, and cheered when he heard that Happy had thought Peter had been an intruder because of his hat.\u00a0\nPeter ended the day with patrol, which was mainly spent swinging around Queens. Crime had decided to sleep on that Wednesday, and it was a blessing. He went home earlier than he normally would from a Spiderman trip, and then collapsed into his bed, ready for the next day.\nThursday and Friday were as uneventful as Monday. It appeared that his days just fused into two days of somewhat stress, but then left him alone for most of the days. He kept up his routine \u2014 breakfast, news in the lab, solving problems and attending boring meetings. By Friday, he felt quite well-versed, quite set in the routine. Maybe, if he was bored over the summer, he\u2019d spend a couple more days taking on an actual CEO role. Just maybe.\u00a0\nTony and Pepper returned from their vacation, both looking tanned and significantly less stressed than they had before the trip. They thanked Peter, and when Tony had asked what Peter wanted, Peter had just asked for a lab session. He didn\u2019t want a gift he wouldn\u2019t use or a private plane \u2014 at least not for another few years anyways. Peter would much rather spend time in the lab with his mentor, his dad for all sense and purposes.\u00a0\nThey hadn\u2019t had that chat, but they had graduated up to more and more hugs, ever since Tony had embraced him in a bear hug when Peter finally, finally told him all the details about Flash. Tony knew the details: he\u2019d known that Peter and Flash had semi-made up.\nAnd it was true, Flash had been better in the last several weeks, as though being publicly shamed had actually improved his behaviour.\u00a0\nBut Peter had still laughed when Tony had suggested that he should go to kill Flash after hearing about one particular incident in gym class where Peter had emerged with a large bruise on his face. He\u2019d never explained it to the nurse, passing it off as just an incident with a basketball, but there were few ways to explain away a punch from your bully to people who knew him, who noticed. The black eye had taken weeks to fully heal \u2014 it had been pre-Spider bite.\u00a0\nNo, Flash wasn\u2019t a threat any more. But there was something that kept Peter awake at night, and that was the announcement that was soon to be held at Stark Industries in one of their conference rooms, the same room as the intern fair he\u2019d arranged with that employee from HR many months ago. He was going public, on record as heir to Stark Industries and future CEO.\u00a0\nPeter was fairly well versed in secret identities. He\u2019d spent years as Spiderman with the mask on, triple-checking places before he would pull his mask off, worrying about who to trust and what to say around certain people. He was well-versed, too, in keeping his Peter Parker life fairly secret, despite all of the publicity that should have found him by now. He\u2019d been exceedingly lucky that none of the Stark employees, nor his classmates had decided to break their NDAs and other contracts to reveal Peter\u2019s identity as heir to the company.\u00a0 It was probably with the knowledge of the wrath that would follow from Pepper, for revealing the identity of a minor. Everyone, after all, wanted to keep their jobs. And get an education.\u00a0\nWhat Peter wasn\u2019t well-versed in was how to take that mask off, how to reveal his identity to a world where the spotlight would be thrust on him. It was the day of the announcement, the day that Peter Parker would become known to the world as the heir to Stark Industries, as joint-CEO with Pepper.\u00a0\n\nHi, my name is Peter Parker, and, as Mr Stark just told you all\u2026\n\nPeter stared at himself in the mirror, trying desperately to keep his brain off it. He had a thousand texts from Ned and MJ, both of whom were sending extremely supportive messages and thumbs up emojis. They\u2019d been invited to come by Pepper and Tony, but Peter had said it was something he should do by himself. May, too, had remained at the apartment, despite her protestations. Peter didn\u2019t want her to be a pre-mature target of questions. It was best to keep the people he loved out of it.\nPeter smiled at some of the gifs of cats that MJ had sent, to try to soothe him. There was even the photo of him as Spiderman with that cat from that time he\u2019d been photographed. That was another development \u2014 after some coaching from Tony about how to pick up a girl, and then corrected coaching from Pepper, Peter had asked MJ out. They\u2019d been on two dates, and Peter grinned every time he thought about it. Hopefully the unfortunate fame that came with being Tony Stark\u2019s heir wouldn\u2019t put her off, but he didn\u2019t think she\u2019d care.\u00a0\nHe knew there would be backlash. There would be deepdives into his history, people scouring his life. Classmates being interviewed, old friends of his parents giving details he didn\u2019t want to be exposed to the public. Probably some false rumours of him being Tony\u2019s child, because that\u2019s where everyone\u2019s brain went. Even Flash, who had got the balls to ask Peter three days before graduation whether he was actually Tony\u2019s biological son. There would be problems that arose from the press conference, questions that would need to be asked. But hey, he was Peter Parker. He\u2019d been through a hell of a lot more than some snarky reporters.\u00a0\nBut Peter felt ready for it. It had only been a few weeks since the field trip, but something had vitally changed since it, and his week alone at Stark Industries. He\u2019d stopped being scared of the idea of being heir, stopped feeling faint when he thought of the company being his to control, his to make decisions for, without any authorisation.\u00a0\nPeter had changed from the kid who couldn\u2019t comprehend being an actual intern. He\u2019d graduated high school, got a girlfriend who knew about him being the heir and about him being Spiderman, and he\u2019d stood up to his bully.\u00a0\nHe was still bricking it though, just thinking about his speech after Tony made the announcement.\u00a0\n\nHi, my name is Peter Parker, and, as Mr Stark just told you all\u2026\n\nBrave as he could possibly try to be, he donned his favourite suit, a classic black jacket and white shirt, and did several checks in the mirror. Was his hair out of place? No, it was fine, or at least, as fine as it could be. Was there anything in his teeth from his breakfast? No, nothing, fine. Could he still smile and speak without shaking like a leaf? Yes, but he didn\u2019t have a strong grip on either of those abilities at that moment.\u00a0\nAnd then he exited his bathroom and walked out into Tony\u2019s penthouse, right at the top of the building. They\u2019d agreed as a trio that it would be better for him to spend the night at the building, to avoid the press as they flocked to SI for the announcement, and to settle his jitters.\u00a0\nTony and Pepper met him with award-winning smiles, both looking equally done up. Tony wore a similar black and white suit to Peter\u2019s. They had the same tailor now, which was only going to exacerbate the whole \u2018son\u2019 theory. Pepper wore a stunning dark blue dress.\u00a0\n\u201cHi guys,\u201d Peter said, a bit shakily.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be fine, Pete,\u201d Tony reminded him, pulling Peter into a hug. He whispered in Peter\u2019s ear, a reassurance, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be great. You\u2019re great.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Peter smiled into the hug.\u00a0\nThey made their way down to the conference hall, one powerful trio on the elevators. FRIDAY, of course, fast tracked them straight there. Peter was clicking his fingers, one at a time. Tony made a couple of light hearted comments about the press individuals who were there, giving Peter some tips, but he was sort of spaced out. In his prepping mode, like he used to do for any group presentation or big meeting. Spend five minutes not talking, just running it over in his mind.\u00a0\n\nHi, my name is Peter Parker, and as Mr Stark just told you all\u2026\u00a0\n\nWhen they arrived at the hall, Peter pulled Tony aside before they went in.\u00a0\n\u201cTony,\u201d Peter bit his lip. \u201cI\u2019m nervous.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI know,\u201d Tony nodded, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, they\u2019re not expecting you to be perfect. They\u2019re not expecting anything, honestly. I\u2019ll keep the focus on me if I think you\u2019re losing it \u2014 I\u2019ll just pretend to faint and fall off the stage, and then you can run out if you want to, just give me a thumbs down sneakily, and that\u2019s the plan. Or a code word?\u201d He mused.\u00a0\n\u201cTony,\u201d Peter raised his eyebrows, but had to try really hard to suppress the smile that was sneaking through onto his face.\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, but honestly. Just give me the word and it\u2019s over, kiddo.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Peter sighed. \u201cLet\u2019s do this.\u201d\u00a0\nHe wasn\u2019t ready for the excessive flashing of cameras when he emerged with Tony and Pepper, but he ignored them and sat down at the press table.The first bit was up to Tony.\n\u201cThank you all for gathering here today. As stated previously, we have an announcement to make about the future of Stark Industries,\u201d Tony took a moment to stare at some of the journalists with an air of intimidation. \u201cThis is Peter Parker. He\u2019s our current intern director, and his other official role is CEO-in-training, because this is the future Peter Parker will be the\u2014 my heir to Stark Industries. I will now let him introduce himself.\u201d\u00a0\nTony smiled encouragingly and looked at Peter.\u00a0\n\u201cHi, my name is Peter Parker,\u201d Peter stared out onto the crowd, and then continued, \u201cAnd, as Mr Stark just told you all, I\u2019m going to be CEO of Stark Industries. I wanted to introduce myself to you all.\u201d And so he continued, occasionally reminding himself of what he wanted to say by looking at the little flashcards he had prepared. Both Tony and Pepper kept shooting him reassuring glances and thumbs ups.\u00a0\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Peter let out a small breath as he came to the end of his speech, and smiled. Several cameras from the back of the room flashed. He desperately hoped his hair wasn\u2019t messed up. As the crowd realised he was finished there was a flurry of questions, reporters pushing their microphones closer to hear his answers.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat colleges are you considering, Mr Parker?\u201d\n\u201cPeter, are you actually Tony\u2019s son?\u201d Peter had to stop himself from raising his eyebrows. Wow, that hadn\u2019t taken long. Tony stood up from his seat at that one, shaking his head rapidly and standing next to Peter.\n\u201cDon\u2019t say anything,\u201d Tony whispered, and Peter nodded. Message received. He hadn\u2019t been planning on it, anyways.\u00a0\n\u201cPeter! Are you dating anyone right now?\u201d Peter couldn\u2019t stop his eyebrows from shooting up in surprise. Woah! What an invasion of privacy. Thankfully, Tony stepped in.\u00a0\n\u201cAnnndddd, we\u2019re not taking questions for Peter at this time. Thank you,\u201d Tony said, whisking him away. They exited the conference room, ignoring the flurry of questions and noise as they left. Peter kept his eyes shielded away from the cameras as he left.\u00a0\nWhen they got out of sight, Tony pulled him into the biggest hug Peter had ever received, from anyone.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m so proud of you, bambino,\u201d Tony said whilst Peter was encased in the hug, and it reverberated through Peter\u2019s body with warmth. I\u2019m so proud of you. Peter was going to melt.\nAnd with that, it was over. The news was out. Peter Parker was the heir to Stark Industries. The announcement had been made. The employees of Stark Industries knew. His classmates knew. The press knew. Everyone knew that Peter Parker was the heir, and most importantly, Peter knew he was the heir.\u00a0"
