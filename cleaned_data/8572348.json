    "text": "Harry had been certain that things would go poorly from the very instant he found out that Draco Malfoy would be his partner for the next six weeks, because when had anything involving him and Malfoy ever gone well?\nBut even knowing that from the very beginning, when he later looked back on all of this, he would still find himself surprised\u2014and vaguely impressed\u2014that he and Malfoy had somehow managed to make a total cock-up of it within the first twenty minutes.\nIt was even more impressive when he took into consideration that their assignment wasn\u2019t supposed to be at all dangerous. By now, six months into their training, The Magical Law Enforcement Patrol had begun shunting over some of their least perilous assignments so that the Auror trainees could go out and get a little bit of practical experience to go along with the endless heaps of coursework they were assigned. Harry had been looking forward to this for months, and he and Ron exchanged eager grins at the thought of finally getting out of the classroom and into the field.\nBut Harry\u2019s excitement rapidly collapsed into limp resignation when the instructor announced that instead of being allowed to choose their own partners, as they\u2019d been previously allowed to do for classwork and training assignments, they were to be put in pairs alphabetically. Ron gave Harry a pitying look at that, because their class of trainees was fairly small, and that meant that no one came between Malfoy and Potter. And while they\u2019d all mostly put their differences aside and did their best to put the past behind them, they still didn\u2019t particularly like each other. It was only the smallest consolation that Malfoy didn\u2019t look any more pleased about their assignment than Harry felt.\nAnd so now here was Harry, trapped with Malfoy in a cramped evidence room, sorting through a trunk full of magical miscellanea that had somehow ended up in a Muggle charity shop. Two more trunks sat stacked in the corner, and Harry\u2019s afternoon stretched interminably before him. Sighing, he set aside the hand mirror he held, and dutifully marked it down on the inventory sheet.\n\u201cThis is all junk,\u201d Malfoy complained, pulling out a handful of photographs. The people in them\u2014at a wedding, judging from the young witch\u2019s elaborate white robes\u2014waved and smiled. Malfoy tossed them carelessly into a nearby evidence box, then reached for his quill and added the photographs to the list of inventory.\n\u201cYeah, but it\u2019s obviously wizarding junk,\u201d Harry told him evenly. It helped a little that Malfoy had so far only complained about the job and not about Harry himself, but the constant griping was still beginning to wear on Harry\u2019s patience.\nHe pulled out a small brass music box that, when opened, played a tinkling rendition of \u2018You Charmed the Heart Right Out of Me.\u2019 That might make a good Christmas gift for Molly, Harry thought as he shut the music box and put it in with the other things they\u2019d already looked through. She loved Celestina Warbeck. He\u2019d have to see if he could find one of those that wasn\u2019t evidence in an active investigation.\n\u201cSo what?\u201d Malfoy said sulkily, sifting through the trunk and coming up with a huge floppy-brimmed hat trimmed with blue silk ribbon rosettes and taxidermied puffskeins. He held it out consideringly, and for one wild moment, Harry thought he was about to try it on. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if Muggles will be able to tell the difference.\u201d\n\u201cMalfoy,\u201d Harry sighed. \u201cYou are holding a hat decorated with actual magical creatures. Right in your hands. I\u2019m sure that Muggles would be able to figure out that puffskeins are a sort of animal they\u2019ve never seen before. They\u2019d be falling all over themselves to discover a new species, and the absolute last thing we need is an uproar in the scientific community.\u201d\n\u201cThere would be no such thing,\u201d Malfoy said as he crammed the hat into the box with the photographs, shoving down hard to make it fit. He folded the box flaps down and sealed them with a spell. \u201cThey\u2019re all willfully ignorant. Muggles don\u2019t believe in anything that doesn\u2019t fit with their astoundingly narrow little world view.\u201d\n\u201cKnow that many Muggles, do you?\u201d Harry asked, resisting the urge to roll his eyes. He handed over the inventory sheet and Malfoy slapped it on top, affixed it with a Sticking Charm, and covered it with another charm to protect it.\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to know them,\u201d Malfoy said loftily. A swish of his wand sent the evidence box to the far corner with the rest of the boxes they\u2019d filled so far. \u201cEverybody knows how Muggles are.\u201d\nHarry bit his tongue as he looked into the bottom of the trunk while Malfoy got a new evidence box and a blank inventory sheet. Continuing this ridiculous argument wouldn\u2019t do either of them any favors, and the afternoon would go faster if they kept working and didn\u2019t allow themselves to become distracted by bickering with each other.\nThey were nearly halfway through this trunk, and that hadn\u2019t taken long at all. There were two more trunks so they could be done in about another hour. Then all they had to do was take the boxes and empty trunks down to Evidence, submit their inventory lists to the Patrolmen who were investigating where these magical items had come from, and then they\u2019d be done. Harry could put up with Malfoy for that much longer. They\u2019d be finished before he knew it.\nWillfully ignoring that tomorrow he\u2019d have to come back and face another full day of Malfoy, Harry bit back a sigh and took out a silver compact with a cabbage rose etched into the top. He just had to get through this afternoon. Small goals. Reasonable goals. He could do this.\n\u201cYou look lovely, dear!\u201d trilled the little round mirror inside when Harry flipped the lid open, and Malfoy snorted.\n\u201cWell that\u2019s obviously defective,\u201d he said. \u201cMake sure you note that in the inventory, will you? Enchanted mirror can\u2019t tell the difference between an attractive person and a speccy git. Maybe you ought to give it your glasses.\u201d\nAnd, wonderful. They\u2019d now moved on to personal insults.\nHarry resisted the urge to throw the compact right at Malfoy\u2019s head. Instead, he snapped it shut and dropped it in the evidence box. He very deliberately ignored Malfoy and reached down into the trunk for a length of braided silk cord that he saw sticking out of the rest of the junk, preparing to pull it loose, and didn\u2019t realize that Malfoy had grabbed the other end of it until a sudden crackle of magic flared to life between them, and the cords glowed gold and wrapped themselves around Harry\u2019s and Malfoy\u2019s wrists.\nHarry jerked back in surprised, wrenching his arm free. The glow faded and the cords slipped from around Malfoy\u2019s wrist and fell limply to the ground.\n\u201cWhat the fuck was that?\u201d Harry asked, looking from the cords to Malfoy\u2019s face, and his heart sank like a pebble tossed into a pool. If the stricken expression on Malfoy\u2019s face was anything to go by, then whatever had just happened was very bad indeed. \u201cMalfoy?\u201d he asked, rubbing idly at his wrist where a lingering trace of magic made his skin tingle. \u201cWhat just happened?\u201d\n\u201cIt would appear that those are handfasting cords,\u201d Malfoy said shakily, pushing up his sleeve. And there, around his right wrist, was a dark brown mark like a coiled rope. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve just bonded ourselves to each other.\u201d\nAlarmed, Harry pushed up his own sleeve and found the same mark on his own wrist. He rubbed at it. \u201cWe\u2019re bonded?\u201d he blurted out, panic rising.\nMalfoy cast a slew of spells at himself and Harry, and whatever he saw in the results made him sag in relief. \u201cTemporarily,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s only temporary. It appears to be a type of spell that\u2019s sometimes used in political marriages, or to marriages arranged to solidify relations between two families. It encourages the newlyweds to spend time together. You know, really make a go of it. Typically, the spell will only last about a month.\u201d\nMake a go of it? What did that even mean? And a month? Harry had to make a go of it with Malfoy for a whole month?\nMalfoy heaved a theatrically large sigh. \u201cYou needn\u2019t look so alarmed. This is inconvenient, but hardly an emergency.\u201d\n\u201cWell sorry,\u201d Harry told him. He took a deep breath and tried to will his heart to stop thumping. Malfoy wouldn\u2019t be this calm if there was really something to be alarmed over. Whatever the spells he\u2019d cast had told him, it\u2019d been enough to make him relax about it. \u201cIt\u2019s not like they teach this stuff in school.\u201d\nMalfoy leveled a scathing look at him. \u201cYou\u2019re an Auror trainee, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well, they haven\u2019t taught this stuff here, either,\u201d Harry told him. \u201cLook, instead of going on about how this is something I should already know, why don\u2019t you save us both a lot of bother and just tell me?\u201d\n\u201cBonds are like any other magic,\u201d Malfoy said, folding his arms over his chest and looking down his nose at Harry. \u201cThe stronger the effect of the spell, the more intent they require to cast. This,\u201d He gestured at the handfasting cords, \u201cdidn\u2019t require any intent from us. Therefore, it\u2019s not a powerful spell.\u201d\nHe had this I honestly can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve actually got to explain this to you sort of tone to his voice that made Harry want to punch him right in his pointy nose.\nBut alas, punching Malfoy (as satisfying as it\u2019d undoubtedly be) would probably only make him even more inclined to be an arsehole about this.\n\u201cSo it can be undone?\u201d Harry asked instead.\n\u201cOf course it can,\u201d Malfoy said, and he still had that infuriatingly superior tone to his voice. \u201cIf we went to St Mungo\u2019s, they could have it undone in about five seconds.\u201d\nA great wash of relief swept through Harry. \u201cFantastic. Let\u2019s go.\u201d It\u2019s not as if sorting through this junk couldn\u2019t wait an hour or so while he and Malfoy got themselves seen to.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Malfoy said, bringing Harry up short. \u201cWe\u2019re not going.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d Harry asked, baffled. \u201cYou just said they could undo the bond.\u201d\n\u201cYes, they can. And if we go, there\u2019ll be a record of it.\u201d\nHarry gaped at him. \u201cWait, really? You\u2019d rather spend a month stuck together than report this?\u201d\n\u201cAs loathe as I am to admit that we fucked up this badly on our very first assignment, no, that\u2019s not what I meant,\u201d Malfoy said. \u201cI want you to think very carefully, Potter. This happened in a matter of seconds. Going to St Mungo\u2019s would involve people finding out what happened. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it\u2019d make the papers, seeing as how the entire bloody world is endlessly fascinated with everything you do. Do you really want this to get out into the world where some of your, how shall we say, your more dedicated fans might hear of it and get ideas?\u201d\nHarry\u2019s stomach clenched. He thought of Romilda Vane. All it\u2019d take was one gossipy Mediwitch or Mediwizard, one patient overhearing something they shouldn\u2019t, just one person going to the papers. Even four weeks of Malfoy\u2019s unrelenting company would be better than the sheer ongoing hell that would come of this if the papers ran a story about what had happened, because at least there\u2019d be an end to Malfoy. At least Harry knew that Malfoy wouldn't do anything worse to him than pick a fight or two or twelve, and Harry had plenty of experience with Malfoy acting like a complete arsehole.\nBut why should Malfoy care? He wouldn\u2019t be affected by any of that, if the story got out. And there was no way he was offering to protect Harry out of the goodness of his heart. He\u2019d want something for it. And Harry was willing to bet he already had something in mind.\n\u201cWhy would you do this for me? What do you want in return?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cI owe you a Life Debt,\u201d Malfoy said right away. \u201cI want to be absolved of that.\u201d\nHarry had never intended to call it in\u2014the idea of forcing anyone to do his will made him deeply uncomfortable\u2014so it was a small enough price to pay. \u201cDeal,\u201d he said, offering his hand.\nAfter a brief hesitation, Malfoy reached out and they shook. His fingers were cold and a little clammy, and Harry rubbed his hand on his thigh after they let go.\n\u201cNow what?\u201d Harry asked.\n\u201cNow we do our jobs and finish with these bloody trunks,\u201d Malfoy said. He picked up one of the paper envelopes layered with protective charms they\u2019d been given for anything that might pose a threat. He enlarged it with a tap of his wand, picked up the handfasting cords and slipped them inside, sealed it, labeled it, and tossed it in the evidence box. Then he lifted a silver cigarette case out of the trunk.\n\u201cSo, you mentioned effects,\u201d Harry said after a few minutes. \u201cWhat exactly are we facing?\u201d\nMalfoy gave him a put-upon look as he tossed the cigarette case into the evidence box and made an entry for it on the inventory list. Harry clenched his teeth and waited him out.\n\u201cWe\u2019re required to spend time together,\u201d Malfoy said. He picked up a fancy crystal inkwell, and held it up to the light to examine a smudge of dried blue ink in the bottom.\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s all?\u201d Harry prompted when Malfoy didn\u2019t seem inclined to continue. \u201cHow much time do we have to spend together?\u201d\n\u201cEnough to satisfy the bond,\u201d Malfoy said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to test it later to see how long we can be apart.\u201d\n\u201cWhat happens then?\u201d Harry asked, patience rapidly wearing thin. Getting answers out of Malfoy was like pulling teeth.\n\u201cA wide variety of highly unpleasant physical effects,\u201d Malfoy said. \u201cWeakness, fatigue, insomnia, nausea, headache, et cetera, et cetera. The effects get worse the longer the bonded couple spends away from each other.\u201d\nAll of that sounded horrible. \u201cOkay, so we spend time together. That won\u2019t be so hard. I mean, we\u2019re going to be working together for the next six weeks.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to live together, too,\u201d Malfoy said. \u201cSharing a bed is one of the typical requirements of bonds like these.\u201d\nHarry froze. \u201cSharing a bed?\u201d he echoed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bond typically used for marriages, Potter,\u201d Malfoy snapped. \u201cTrust me, I\u2019m not thrilled about this, either.\u201d\nIt took some effort, but Harry bit back a retort. He bit back a great load of swearing, too. He took a deep breath, then another, and another, until the urge to hex Malfoy subsided. \u201cSo, spending lots of time together, living together, sharing a bed. Is there anything else this bond is going to make us do?\u201d\n\u201cWhat, that\u2019s not enough for you?\u201d Malfoy drawled, and the last thread of Harry\u2019s patience gave way.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re forcing me to drag each piece of information out of you, but this is going to be enough of a challenge to get through without you deliberately being an obnoxious dickhead,\u201d Harry told him. \nMalfoy opened his mouth, then shut his mouth again, then very quietly said, \u201cAll right.\" And it wasn\u2019t anything even approaching an apology, but Harry had a feeling it was probably the best he could expect.\n\u201cAll right, then,\u201d Harry echoed, sitting back in his seat.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not much more to it than I\u2019ve already said,\u201d Malfoy told Harry after a moment. He picked up a pewter figurine of a rearing unicorn from the trunk and examined it. \u201cSharing a bed, keeping close by each other. Sometimes talking can be a requirement, but we shouldn\u2019t have any trouble with that one, as we\u2019ll have to talk for work, at least.\u201d He took a breath. \u201cAnd touch.\u201d His gaze darted up to Harry and then away again quick as a blink. \u201cThey usually require touch.\u201d\n\u201cWait,\u201d Harry said as an image of himself getting fucked by Malfoy flashed through his mind. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to have sex, do we?\u201d\nMalfoy\u2019s cheeks were turning steadily pinker. \u201cMost likely not,\u201d he said, which wasn\u2019t the solid No that Harry had hoped for, but was certainly better than a definite Yes. \u201cThe point of this sort of bond is to encourage two people to get to know each other in the hopes that they\u2019ll eventually grow to love each other on their own. Forcing them into doing something they\u2019re not ready for rather defeats the point.\u201d\n\u201cBut forcing them to share a bed doesn\u2019t do that,\u201d Harry said skeptically.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a different sort of intimacy,\u201d Malfoy said, still not looking at Harry. \u201cSex complicates things in a way that sharing a bed won\u2019t.\u201d\nAnd Harry supposed he really couldn\u2019t argue with that. Sighing a little to himself, he returned his attention to the job at hand. He reached into the trunk and pulled out a little ceramic bell, and picked up his quill to record it on his inventory.\n- - -x- - -\nEverything went well enough until it was time to leave. Touch, as it turned out, was in fact a requirement of the bond. Thirty minutes after accidentally triggering the spell, a faint itching started up under Harry\u2019s skin, and Malfoy sighed and said, \u201cBollocks.\u201d\nFortunately, the bond didn\u2019t seem to require skin contact, and was easily satisfied by Malfoy stretching out his leg and resting the toe of his polished leather shoe against the side of Harry\u2019s trainer for a few minutes. By the third time Malfoy\u2019s foot nudged up against his, Harry barely even noticed. They finished sorting through the trunks, delivered the evidence boxes and trunks to Evidence and submitted their paperwork, and they were free to go for the day.\nBut go where was currently the topic of some debate.\n\u201cYou live in the old Black place, don\u2019t you?\u201d Malfoy asked, looking down his nose. \u201cAbsolutely not. We\u2019ll be staying in my flat.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s more space at mine,\u201d Harry tried to argue. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole house.\u201d\n\u201cYes, but we\u2019re going to have to stay close to each other,\u201d Malfoy countered. \u201cHaving space isn\u2019t exactly an issue we need to resolve.\u201d\n\u201cMine\u2019s got a house-elf,\u201d Harry said. He wasn\u2019t sure that Kreacher was truly a selling point, but he was banking on the fact that Malfoy had never actually met him.\n\u201cMine doesn\u2019t have mice,\u201d Malfoy said.\n\u201cMy house doesn\u2019t have mice,\u201d Harry said defensively. Well, it didn\u2019t have many mice. But it was an old house that had been inhabited only occasionally over the last two decades, and Auror training kept Harry busy. He had noticed the occasional scratching sound coming from the walls, and he did keep meaning to do something about it, but he just hadn\u2019t got around to it yet. Besides, winter was setting in and that\u2019s when Grimmauld Place\u2019s annual Doxy infestation tended to flare up, and god only knew why they liked that bloody house so much but each year they swarmed in by the dozens. Really it made sense to wait and then take care of all of it at once, as he\u2019d vaguely been planning to do. And now that Harry thought about it, maybe having Malfoy living with him wouldn\u2019t be the best idea after all. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t,\u201d he insisted anyhow.\nMalfoy only arched his eyebrows skeptically. \u201cGenerations of Blacks have lived in that house and were unable to get rid of the mice. It\u2019s practically family legend at this point. Yet you expect me to believe that you were somehow able to manage? In, what, seven months?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m the Chosen One?\u201d Harry tried. Malfoy gave him a flat look, and Harry sighed, defeated. \u201cFine. We\u2019ll stay at your flat.\u201d\n\u201cLovely,\u201d Malfoy said. \u201cSo glad we\u2019ve got that sorted.\u201d\nMalfoy gave Harry his Floo address, and then Harry went to Grimmauld Place to pack up his things. He stamped soot from his shoes, then started up the stairs, unbuttoning the heavy robes of his Auror uniform as he went.\nHe\u2019d taken the second largest bedroom in the house, partly because the master bedroom still smelled faintly of hippogriff, no matter what Harry tried to do to remove the smell, and partly because sleeping in the cavernous master bedroom would have only served as even more of a reminder that he was rattling around this big old place all by himself. So he took the smaller bedroom and he tried not to think about the rest of it as best he could. And in any case, this bedroom was on the same floor as the sitting room, which meant that he had to climb up and down less flights of stairs, so using it really did make the most sense.\nAfter he changed into a pair of jeans and a warm jumper, he tromped up to the attic to fetch his old school trunk. Back down in the bedroom, he packed it with his uniform robes, jeans and shirts and jumpers, pants and socks, and a wool peacoat. A flick of his wand toward the bathroom brought a collection of bottles and jars zipping through the air to deposit themselves into the trunk, soap and shampoo and shaving cream and toothpaste, a toothbrush and a razor, and a fluffy white bath towel. He piled in all his textbooks and class notes, quills and ink and parchment, then threw the backlog of Quidditch magazines that\u2019d been steadily accumulating over the last six months on top. Auror training kept him so busy that he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d need anything else while he was staying at Malfoy\u2019s. And even if he did forget something, he could stop by easily enough to get it later.\nAfter a quick trip down to the kitchen to inform Kreacher that he\u2019d be away (Kreacher had been, as Harry had expected, entirely indifferent) and pick up his favorite mug and a box of the tea he preferred, Harry was ready to leave. He hauled his trunk over to the Floo and hesitated. Traveling with a large object wasn\u2019t against the law, per se, but the Floo Network Authority did tend to frown upon it. Baggage-related incidents were the second most common cause of Floo Network injuries, and the whole point of staying bonded to Malfoy was to avoid St Mungo\u2019s.\nBut fuck it, Harry thought to himself as he scooped up a good handful of Floo powder from the repurposed jam jar on the mantel. He was willing to gamble that getting himself accidentally bonded to Malfoy was the worst thing that would happen to him today.\nHe was pleased when that turned out to be true. Harry stumbled from Malfoy\u2019s Floo and managed to get himself out of the way just in time for his trunk to come clattering out behind him, bringing with it a spray of soot.\nHarry supposed he\u2019d feel worse about it if he weren\u2019t so busy feeling impressed with himself that he\u2019d taken his trunk through the Floo and hadn\u2019t earned himself a trip to the hospital. He breathed out a soft sigh of relief and looked around at the place he'd be living in for the next four weeks.\nMalfoy\u2019s flat was not at all what Harry had imagined. He\u2019d expected something like the Manor, cold and formal, all pale marble and high ceilings, and filled with the sort of furniture that people bought more for decoration than comfort. But Malfoy\u2019s flat was warm and surprisingly cozy, with dark wood floors and huge windows. Malfoy had about four bookcases worth of books crammed onto two bookcases, and his sofa and the two matching chairs that flanked it had thick cushions that looked wonderfully soft and inviting. A large Persian rug completed the room, and thank god the soot hadn\u2019t quite made it that far.\nMalfoy came in as Harry was still casting charms to clean the floor. \u201cGood Merlin,\u201d he sighed, sounding enormously put-upon. \u201cIs this what I can expect from you?\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Harry said with very-obviously forced cheerfulness, casting another Scourgify. \u201cStart as you mean to go on.\u201d\n\u201cBrilliant,\u201d Malfoy said, then sighed again. \u201cBedroom\u2019s through there, I cleared out the left half of the wardrobe and the bottom two bureau drawers for your things.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Harry said, caught momentarily flat-footed by Malfoy\u2019s unexpected generosity. He\u2019d been prepared to live out of his trunk for the next month. \u201cThanks. That\u2019s very thoughtful of you.\u201d\n\u201cHardly,\u201d Malfoy said. \u201cI just didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to stand looking at you in wrinkled robes. Come into the kitchen when you\u2019re done. I\u2019ve got dinner on.\u201d\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Harry said to Malfoy\u2019s retreating back. He grabbed his trunk and lugged it into the bedroom.\nMalfoy had painted his walls a soothing shade of blue and decorated them with what looked like illustrated pages from his old Hogwarts Astronomy textbook enlarged and framed. A plush navy blue area rug covered most of the floor, with a soft, thick pile that just begged Harry to dig his toes into it. The furniture was all plain, dark wood, and there was a heavy ceramic lamp in the shape of a Romanian Longhorn on the nightstand, with jewel eyes and an upturned snout and the white lampshade bent into a whimsical shape that looked like a puff of smoke being exhaled.\nAnd then there was the bed.\nObjectively, it was a very nice bed; it looked soft and inviting, with a puffy duvet in a crisp white cover and a whole heap of fluffy pillows piled up against the headboard. But to Harry, knowing that in a few short hours he\u2019d be climbing into it with Malfoy, together, the mere sight of it made his nerves tie themselves up in knots.\nHarry did his best to put it from his mind, and quickly put his things away, hanging his robes in the wardrobe and putting stacks of tee-shirts and trousers and socks and pants neatly into the bureau drawers Malfoy had cleared for him. When he finished, he closed his trunk and put it against the wall under the window. He didn\u2019t see any reason to unpack the rest of it right now.\nThen, bracing himself, he turned and went to join Malfoy in the kitchen.\n- - -x- - -\nLater that evening, Harry lingered in the bathroom as long as he could reasonably get away with, dawdling as he washed his face and brushed his teeth and changed into his pajamas. \nThen, when he could put it off no longer, he shut off the light, stood there in the darkness for a moment to gather his nerve, and then opened up the door.\nMalfoy was already in bed when Harry stepped back into the bedroom, curled up on the right side and facing the wall, leaving the left side of the bed empty for Harry. He stared at Malfoy\u2014the shape his his shoulder made under the covers and the way his hair looked almost gold against the crisp white of the pillowcase\u2014and forced down a fresh wave of panic. He\u2019d been nervous enough about this when the bed was empty; facing the bed with Malfoy in it, with the corner of the sheets on Harry\u2019s side turned invitingly down, ready and waiting for him to get in, well. Harry wasn\u2019t at all prepared for this.\nHe swallowed hard and told himself he was being ridiculous. There wasn\u2019t anything worse than a bit of awkwardness that could possibly come of this. This would be fine. There was nothing at all to be worried about.\nHarry got into bed, leaned over to turn off the lamp, slid his glasses safely under his pillow, then settled stiffly on his back.\n\u201cTurn over,\u201d Malfoy said without moving. \u201cWe can put our backs to each other. That ought to suffice for contact.\u201d\nHarry thought about asking Malfoy to swap sides with him\u2014he normally slept on his right side and lying with his back to Malfoy would put him on his left\u2014but in the end he didn\u2019t say anything, just turned obediently over and scooted back, and his arse bumped against Malfoy\u2019s. Malfoy quickly shifted away, resettling himself so that their backs pressed together and there was space between the rest of them. Harry wanted to pull the pillow over his head and smother himself with it, because his arse had just touched Malfoy\u2019s arse. Touching of arses had just occurred, and worse, Harry\u2019s stupid brain refused to stop replaying how it had felt warm and surprisingly soft against his own, and now he was thinking about touching Malfoy\u2019s arse with his hands and oh god that was worse.\n\u201cNngggh,\u201d Harry said and clasped a hand over his face as a wave of cringey shame washed over him.\nMalfoy shifted around again, the warmth of his back against Harry\u2019s disappearing for a moment before he settled against him again. \u201cAre you quite all right over there?\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d Harry said, and was pleased by how totally and completely normal his voice sounded. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\nIt had only been surprise, he decided. Because Malfoy\u2019s arse was warm and soft while the rest of him was sharp and bony and cold. That\u2019s all it was. Harry was just caught off guard by how touchable Malfoy\u2019s arse felt.\nWait. No. That wasn\u2019t\u2014\nExcept oh god it was.\n\u201cNngggh,\u201d Harry said again, this time with feeling.\n\u201cPotter,\u201d Malfoy said sharply.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Harry muttered, squeezing his eyes shut.\nHe thought he would have a hard time falling asleep, between lying on his left and lying next to Malfoy and the whole arse thing, but barely ten minutes later, he was out.\n- - -x- - -\nOn the first morning of their forced cohabitation, Harry awoke to an empty bed. Yawning, he sat up and looked around, and found the bedroom quiet and dim. He hadn't even considered how bloody awkward it would feel to wake up next to Malfoy, but it looked like he would get to put off that particular experience until tomorrow.\nHe pushed himself out of bed and stretched, then pulled the covers neatly over the bed before he shuffled blearily out into the kitchen in search of his morning cuppa. He found Malfoy seated at the table with both hands curled loosely around a steaming mug, still wearing his green and white plaid pajama bottoms and a soft grey shirt. He had his long legs stretched out under the table, his bare feet looking very pale against the white tile floor, and the sunlight slanting in through the high window backlit his sleep-tousled hair bright gold.\nOh fuck, thought Harry when his heart gave a funny little shiver at the sight of Malfoy looking so soft and gentle and unexpectedly approachable. This is going to be a problem.\nMalfoy startled a little when he finally noticed Harry, tugging the sleeves of his shirt farther down over his wrists.\n\u201cMorning,\u201d Malfoy said, his voice still mellow with sleep, and the sound of it sparked a little flutter in the pit of Harry\u2019s stomach. The bright wash of sunshine made his eyes look very clear and strangely colorless. \u201cI thought you\u2019d sleep for a while yet.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Harry said, looking quickly away. \u201cWell. Here I am.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s still hot water in the kettle,\u201d Malfoy said after a moment.\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThat\u2019s, erm. Thanks. Thank you.\u201d\nMalfoy was looking at him oddly, and Harry gave him a weak smile before he escaped to the other side of the kitchen. Malfoy had taken Harry\u2019s mug and set it beside the kettle for him, and that unexpected bit of thoughtfulness made the flutter in Harry\u2019s stomach grow more intense. \nBecause Malfoy was an attractive person, Harry couldn\u2019t deny that. He\u2019d known for years that Malfoy was exactly his type. But for years that knowledge had only remained an idle observation because Malfoy was horrible and it was really hard to be properly attracted to someone when you also wanted to punch them in their stupid pointy nose all the time. But this Malfoy? Who was still a little sleepy and still a little rumpled, warm and loose and relaxed and for once not being a total arse?\nYeah. Harry could already see this was going to be a problem.\nHe took his time making his tea, lingering over it until the fluttering in his stomach slowly faded.\n\u201cDo you have anything you need to do today?\u201d Harry asked as he took his mug over to the table. He hoped some conversation would distract him from himself, or that Malfoy would say something to remind Harry just how much he disliked Malfoy.\n\u201cYou mean besides go into the Ministry?\u201d Malfoy asked dryly. He stretched out his feet under the table as soon as Harry sat down so that they were touching. His toes were cold even through the warm layer of Harry\u2019s socks. \u201cThis morning's thrilling lecture topic is Application Requests for the Submission of Evidence Confirming Uncorroborated New Testimony. And why they think we need to know that, I haven\u2019t the faintest. Aurors have nothing to do with trying criminals. That\u2019s all the Wizengamot.\u201d\n\u201cI guess they want us to know all the aspects of how a case proceeds?\u201d Harry offered even though he also thought it was ridiculous. Harry shifted his foot so it sat partially atop Malfoy\u2019s, covering up his cold toes. His heartbeat quickened and he did his best to ignore it. This was just Malfoy\u2019s foot; no reason to get worked up over that.\n\u201cBloody waste of time,\u201d Malfoy muttered into his mug.\n\u201cSo, if all you\u2019ve got planned today is training, would you mind going out this evening?\u201d Harry asked, opting to move the conversation along.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got lecture again tomorrow morning,\u201d Malfoy said, frowning.\n\u201cI know, I know,\u201d Harry said. \u201cIt\u2019d just be for a little while, we wouldn\u2019t be out late. It\u2019s just that I had plans to meet Ron and Hermione at a pub. Hermione\u2019s so busy with her job with the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures that I hardly get to see her anymore. I mean, even Ron hardly gets to see her and they live together.\u201d\nMalfoy grimaced. \u201cFine,\u201d he said. His foot twitched beneath Harry\u2019s. \u201cBut you\u2019re paying for my drinks.\u201d\n\u201cDeal,\u201d Harry said quickly.\nMalfoy looked at him suspiciously. Had Harry said that too quickly? He\u2019d probably said that too quickly. But Malfoy shook his head and went back to his tea, and Harry let it go.\nHe\u2019d figure out how to convince Malfoy to go to a pub in Muggle London later. Harry had the whole day to work on that problem.\n- - -x- - -\nIn the end, the way Harry got Malfoy to go along with it was by Side-Alonging him to the alleyway and ushering him quickly in through the back door of the pub. Then, by the time Malfoy realized that Harry had brought him to a Muggle pub, they were already there and it was too late to do anything about it.\nComplain, yes, and Malfoy did so at great length, starting with blurting out, \u201cYou\u2019ve brought me to Muggle London?\u201d as loudly as if he'd never even heard of the Statute of Secrecy. But he didn\u2019t argue. And he mostly shut up once Harry bought him a pint.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Harry said, leading the way to a corner table.\nIt was early enough that there were only a handful of other patrons scattered throughout the pub, and a mild Muggle-Repelling Charm cast around their corner ensured that anyone who came near would suddenly decide that a table on the other side of the room looked much more appealing. Harry wasn\u2019t entirely sure it was necessary, but he didn\u2019t quite trust Malfoy to behave himself amongst Muggles.\nMalfoy took the seat that put his back against the wall, and Harry sat down in the seat beside him, and jumped a little as Malfoy scooted his chair closer and pressed his knee lightly against Harry\u2019s. Malfoy gave him a sour look, then glanced around the rest of the pub, took a sip of his pint, tapped his fingers against the table, took another sip of his pint, and regarded a couple who\u2019d just walked through the door with deep suspicion.\nThis went on for about fifteen minutes, while Harry quietly gritted his teeth and drank his pint and ignored Malfoy as best he could, and then he couldn\u2019t stand it anymore.\n\u201cWill you stop that?\u201d Harry told him when Malfoy started tapping his fingers again.\n\u201cStop what?\u201d\n\u201cThat,\u201d Harry said, putting his hand over Malfoy\u2019s and trapping his tapping fingers against the tabletop. His hand was startlingly cold against Harry's, and for an instant Harry was overcome with the urge to take Malfoy\u2019s hand in both of his to warm it up.\nThen Malfoy pulled his hand free and the strange urge passed.\n\u201cWell pardon me,\u201d Malfoy said sullenly. \u201cI won\u2019t move at all, since it seems to bother you so much. Shall I hold my breath as well? Am I breathing too loud, do you think? I wouldn\u2019t want to annoy you.\u201d\n\u201cYou could stop talking,\u201d Harry said. \u201cThat\u2019d be a great start.\u201d\nPredictably, that earned him a glare. \u201cYou ought to be grateful that I agreed to come here at all,\u201d Malfoy said. \u201cOr that I didn\u2019t walk straight back out when I saw where you\u2019d brought me.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you could be grateful I didn\u2019t force you to live in Grimmauld Place for the next month,\u201d Harry shot back. \u201cWe can sit here all night and go back and forth about who ought to be grateful for what, but I think the next four weeks will go by much easier if we don\u2019t spend them keeping score, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\nMalfoy\u2019s lip curled. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have forced me to live in Grimmauld Place.\u201d\n\u201cCould have dug my heels in about it,\u201d Harry pointed out, and wouldn\u2019t that have been a fun adventure, seeing which of them could out-stubborn the other. \u201cAnd will you stop that.\u201d\nHe put his hand over Malfoy\u2019s tapping fingers again, forcing them still.\nOf course, that was when Ron arrived. Harry didn\u2019t notice his approach until he said, sounding enormously baffled, \u201cHarry? What\u2019s he doing here and why are you holding hands with him?\u201d\nThey jerked apart, startled, and Malfoy gave Ron a narrow-eyed stare. Then he very calmly drained the last of his pint, put the glass down on the table, and turned to Harry and put out his hand. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll need another drink if you expect me to make it through this little outing.\u201d\nHarry obligingly handed over some money, because that seemed to be what would get rid of Malfoy the quickest. Sure enough, after Harry dumped a handful of coins into this palm, Malfoy was up and striding across the pub to the bar. Harry tried his best to ignore the little tingle of worry at the thought of Malfoy going to interact with the Muggle bartender. They\u2019d already had four lectures on how to talk to Muggles, and Malfoy had top marks in their class. He could manage to order himself a pint. Probably.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Ron said. \u201cNow are you going to tell me why Malfoy is here?\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Harry sighed, shoving a hand through his hair. \u201cThat\u2019s sort of a funny story\u2026\u201d he began.\n\u201cLet me get this straight,\u201d Ron said, looking from Harry to Malfoy and back again when Harry finished explaining it. \u201cYou managed to get yourself accidentally bonded to the Ferret on your very first assignment? And now you\u2019ve got to live with him for the next four weeks?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, pretty much,\u201d Harry said miserably. \u201cAnd for the love of god, don\u2019t let him hear you call him that. The next month is going to be difficult enough to get through without the two of you at each other\u2019s throats.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not at his throat,\u201d Ron protested.\n\u201cNo, but he\u2019ll be at yours if he hears you calling him Ferret.\u201d\nRon snorted. \u201cWell, you can relax. I\u2019m not going to antagonize Malfoy,\u201d he said. Harry must not have looked entirely convinced, because Ron rolled his eyes and pointed out, \u201cHaven\u2019t we been in training together for half a year so far? And no one\u2019s hexed anyone else?\u201d\nAnd really, no one had. In truth, Harry was still faintly surprised that it had all gone this well. The very first day of Auror training, when he\u2019d looked up and seen Malfoy walk into the room, he\u2019d been afraid that they\u2019d end up hexing each other, or worse.\nBut instead, everyone had seemed to independently come to the same conclusion: that they had enough to worry about with Auror training, and it would go much easier if they all agreed to do their best to let go of old grudges. And then by their second week into training, they\u2019d been much too busy to waste time and energy on childish squabbling. Harry had done a mostly-okay job of ignoring Malfoy, at least until they were assigned to each other as partners.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Ron said. \u201cDo I even want to know what the handholding was about?\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t handholding,\u201d Harry said. \u201cHe kept tapping his fingers on the table. It was driving me spare so I made him stop.\u201d\nRon gave him a skeptical look, then glanced across the room. Harry followed his gaze. Malfoy had both elbows leaned on the bar as he spoke to the bartender. It made his shirt draw tight across his shoulders, made his lower back curve just-so, made his arse stick out appealingly.\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Ron said, snapping Harry\u2019s attention away from Malfoy. He turned back around and tried his best to look like he hadn\u2019t just been staring at Malfoy\u2019s arse. \n\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked as innocently as he could manage.\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Ron said again, \u201cwhen I walked up and saw you with Malfoy, I thought you were going to tell me that you\u2019d taken up with him.\u201d\nHarry gaped at him. \u201cTaken up with him?\u201d he repeated, because Ron couldn\u2019t be saying what it sounded like he was saying.\n\u201cYeah, you know. Were fucking him, or dating him, or had gone off and got yourself secretly married to him or something.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Why the fuck would you think any of that?\u201d\nRon shrugged again. \u201cFine line between love and hate and all that? There\u2019s always been this weird thing between you and him. Also, you keep staring at his arse.\u201d\n\u201cI do not.\u201d\n\u201cMate. I just saw you do it,\u201d Ron said. \u201cAbout thirty seconds ago.\u201d\nHarry didn\u2019t think there was any way to deny it, so he gave up.\n\u201cWell it\u2019s a very nice arse,\u201d he admitted, and sighed as he slouched back in his seat. \u201cI just wish it weren\u2019t attached to the rest of him.\u201d\n\u201cBecause he\u2019s a giant wanker?\u201d Ron asked, a little hesitant, a little hopeful, like he was afraid of the answer he might get but still couldn\u2019t stop himself from asking.\n\u201cBecause he\u2019s a giant wanker,\u201d Harry agreed, and Ron clapped him hard on the shoulder.\n\u201cThank Merlin,\u201d he said. \u201cJust try to keep that in mind while you stare at his arse.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t stare,\u201d Harry protested, because he didn\u2019t. He just looked sometimes, that was all.\n\u201cBecause if you do take up with him,\u201d Ron went on like Harry hadn\u2019t spoken, \u201cI\u2019m going to have to do my best to get along with him. Because I am a good and supportive friend. And yes, I know he\u2019s nowhere near as much of a shit as he was in school, but I still don\u2019t want to.\u201d\nMalfoy returned just then with three fresh pints. He kept one for himself, and passed the other two to Harry and Ron.\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Harry said, faintly surprised.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re thanking me for it,\u201d Malfoy said as he slid back into his seat. \u201cIt was your money.\u201d He paused and gave Ron a dour look. \u201cI didn\u2019t poison it, you know.\u201d\nRon turned the suspicious look he\u2019d been aiming at the pint onto Malfoy instead. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you had,\u201d he said slowly, as if Malfoy had suggested something utterly absurd. \u201cBecause I watched you carry them over here.\u201d\n\u201cCongratulations,\u201d Malfoy said dryly. \u201cYou\u2019ve got eyes that work.\u201d\nHarry elbowed him. Malfoy elbowed Harry back.\n\u201cI mean, not that I would ever have guessed,\u201d Malfoy continued. \u201cIt\u2019s not that you\u2019re actively training for a career where your keen powers of observation will be of utmost importance, or anything.\u201d He shrugged. \"Then again, they let Potter in, didn't they? So who knows.\"\n\u201cMalfoy,\u201d Harry said warningly.\n\u201cPotter,\u201d Malfoy sing-songed back.\nHarry inhaled slowly through his nose. \u201cDon\u2019t be an arsehole,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t part of our arrangement,\u201d Malfoy said. \u201cThe arrangement was I agree to come here and you pay for my drinks. You never said anything about me having to be nice to anyone.\u201d\n\u201cWait,\u201d Ron said, cutting in. \u201cHarry. You really gave me a talking-to about being nice to him, but you didn\u2019t give him one about being nice to me?\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a talking-to,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI only asked you to not antagonize him.\u201d\n\u201cI was given no such instructions,\u201d Malfoy said smugly.\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Harry said without looking at him.\n\u201cI\u2019m just saying,\u201d Ron went on. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to be your best mate. If you should be giving anyone a talking-to about being nice to anyone else, you should be giving it to him about me.\u201d\nThere was no good way to explain it. Harry had asked Ron because he knew that Ron would go along with it for Harry\u2019s sake; Malfoy had no such interest in making Harry\u2019s life easier, and depending how much of an arsehole he felt like being at the moment, he might even go out of his way to do the opposite.\nLuckily, he was saved from any sort of reply by Hermione approaching their table, pint glass in hand.\n\u201cHermione!\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here.\u201d\n\u201cHello,\u201d Hermione said with a faint frown, looking around the table. \u201cMalfoy, I didn\u2019t realize you\u2019d be joining us.\u201d\n\u201cHe and Harry are bonded,\u201d Ron said as she sat down, then leaned over to kiss her cheek.\nHermione blinked. \u201cBonded?\u201d\n\u201cAccidentally,\u201d Harry said.\n\u201cTemporarily,\u201d Malfoy added.\n\u201cAnd now they have to live together for a month while the bond fades,\u201d Ron finished. He took a drink of his pint.\n\u201cReally,\u201d Hermione said, looking back and forth between Harry and Malfoy. \u201cHow on earth did you manage that?\u201d\n\u201cAccidentally,\u201d Harry said again, because he couldn\u2019t stress enough that this hadn\u2019t been on purpose.\n\u201cReally,\u201d Hermione said again, sounding suspicious now. \u201cAnd there was no way to undo it?\u201d\n\u201cThere is,\u201d Harry said. \u201cBut we\u2019d have to go to St Mungo\u2019s, and then there\u2019d be a record, and if other people found out how easily I\u2019d ended up bonded to Malfoy\u2026\u201d\nHermione grimaced at that. \u201cI see,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, it\u2019s only for a few weeks. So. How was work?\u201d Harry asked in a desperate attempt to change the subject, because she always had plenty to say about work. Hermione was currently working in the Ministry as an assistant to Baxter Babcock, the current head of the Office for Werewolf Support Services in the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. She\u2019d wanted a position with the Office for House-Elf Relocation\u2014the best way to change a system was from within, she said\u2014but they hadn\u2019t had an open position when she\u2019d applied, so she\u2019d settled for Werewolf Support Services instead.\nShe\u2019d been butting heads with Babcock ever since. According to Hermione, he was insufferably small-minded, unbearably arrogant, and the only reason he even worked in Werewolf Support Services was because he was exceptionally lazy and, due to the stigma that werewolves faced, no one ever came in so he never had to do any work. Ron had stopped suggesting that she quit after the second week, recognizing a lost cause when he saw one. No one could dissuade Hermione from something once she\u2019d made up her mind about it, and at this point, she\u2019d made up her mind to single-handedly destroy wizarding society\u2019s intolerance and bias against werewolves.\nFrankly, if anyone could do it, Harry thought it\u2019d be her.\n\u201cOh, Babcock,\u201d she huffed. \u201cI\u2019m trying to organize a program with St Mungo\u2019s where lycanthropy victims can register to receive regular doses of Wolfsbane Potion. All he\u2019d have to do is sign off on it; I told him I\u2019d take care of everything myself and he wouldn\u2019t even have to lift a bloody finger.\u201d\n\u201cLet me guess,\u201d Ron said. \u201cHe rejected it flat-out.\u201d\n\u201cWell, Miss Granger,\u201d Hermione said, deepening her voice and making her tone go as crisp and posh as she could make it in an imitation of Babcock, \u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019re just not looking at it from my point of view.\u201d\n\u201cOf course you\u2019re not looking at it from his point of view,\u201d Malfoy said, and Hermione looked outraged for a split second before Malfoy finished, \u201cTo see anything from Babcock\u2019s point of view, you\u2019d have to stick your head entirely up his arse, and frankly I don\u2019t see how there\u2019d be room for you along with the enormous stick he\u2019s got shoved up there, to say nothing of his overblown sense of self-importance and his delusions of grandeur.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been saying!\u201d Hermione said, lighting up. \u201cThat is exactly what I\u2019ve been saying. It\u2019s absolutely infuriating!\u201d\n\u201cBabcock does tend to inspire that feeling in people,\u201d Malfoy said. \u201cI haven\u2019t been forced to interact with him in any sort of official capacity, thank Merlin. But I\u2019ve been attending Ministry functions with my family since I was old enough to be trusted to tell the salad fork from the dinner fork, and my father has no compunctions about using me as a distraction to get out of conversations with people he\u2019d rather not speak to.\u201d\nHarry tensed, waiting for the inevitable follow-up to that about how those conversations had prepared Malfoy for tonight.\nBut instead, Malfoy regarded Hermione thoughtfully for a moment before he asked, \u201cHave you gone to Curtis Matheson about it?\u201d\n\u201cMatheson?\u201d Hermione repeated. \u201cWhy on earth would I go to the Head of the Department of Magical Transportation about a Magical Creatures issue?\u201d\n\u201cBecause navigating Ministry politics is a bit like trying to untangle a Venomous Tentacula,\u201d Malfoy said. \u201cThere\u2019s a very good reason I went into Law Enforcement instead of following in my father\u2019s footsteps and getting involved in the political side of it. You won\u2019t get anything done without knowing whose arse to kiss and whose arse to kick, the best ways to bribe or put pressure on them, or whom to bribe or put pressure on to do it for you. Getting anywhere with Babcock will be tedious, and there will be a lot of absurd hoops to jump through, but it's doable if you know how to go about it.\u201d\nHermione was frowning a little, but her gaze had gone intense the way it did sometimes in class when she was really focused. \u201cI\u2019m listening,\u201d she said. \u201cYou said I need to speak with Matheson in Magical Transportation?\u201d\nHarry watched with some measure of disbelief and no small amount of relief as Hermione and Malfoy settled into their conversation. This evening was going better than Harry had been afraid it would.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Harry said later that night as he and Malfoy got into bed together. \u201cThanks for helping out Hermione. You, er, you didn\u2019t have to do that, and I appreciate it.\u201d\nMalfoy went still, one knee on the mattress, one foot still on the floor, and the duvet lifted out of his way. \u201cIt was Babcock, Potter,\u201d he said. \u201cThe man ought to have retired a decade ago, and if Granger doesn\u2019t have his job by Easter, I\u2019ll gladly eat my words. All I\u2019ve done is point her in the right direction.\u201d\n\u201cStill,\u201d Harry said, sliding into bed in a soft rustle of sheets. \u201cThanks.\u201d\n\u201cIt was nothing,\u201d Malfoy said. He got into bed and turned out the lamp before settling down. \u201cBut if you really want to thank me, you can handle figuring out dinner for us tomorrow night. We\u2019ve got a Magical Jurisprudence lecture tomorrow morning and a lecture on International Extradition tomorrow afternoon, and I can only handle one of those on any given day.\u201d\nHarry smiled to himself in the darkness. \u201cDeal,\u201d he said.\n- - -x- - -\nAfter two weeks of bedsharing, Harry was almost used to it. The awkwardness of climbing into bed with Malfoy had mostly faded, excepting two more incidents of accidental arse-touching (one Harry\u2019s fault, and one Malfoy\u2019s) and one morning where Harry had woken up first, and looked over at Malfoy to find that he\u2019d kicked the duvet down past his waist and the soft flannel of his pajamas did nothing to disguise the shape of his hard cock. Cheeks hot and his own morning erection throbbing, Harry had managed to slip out of bed without waking him, and hid in the bathroom until he heard Malfoy up and clattering about in the kitchen. (He felt vaguely guilty for wanking in there, but nowhere near as guilty as he felt for the second peek at Malfoy he wasn\u2019t able to resist sneaking before he left the bedroom.)\nSo, getting into bed and then waking up again had their own sets of challenges, but so far the middle part had been mostly all right.\nUntil now, at least.\nHarry woke up suddenly in the middle of the night. At some point, they\u2019d both rolled over, Harry onto his left side and Malfoy onto his back. His head was lolled toward Harry, and every breath he exhaled puffed a big gust of sleep-sour breath directly into Harry\u2019s face.\nGroaning, Harry reached out and nudged at Malfoy until he rolled his head away.\nHarry settled back down and closed his eyes. He had only a few minute\u2019s respite before Malfoy\u2019s head flopped back the other way and he was breathing right in Harry\u2019s face again. Harry nudged him again, harder this time, until Malfoy pointed his face away once more.\nThe third time it happened, Harry yanked the pillow out from under Malfoy\u2019s head and hit him with it.\nMalfoy sputtered awake and got his bearings remarkably quick. He grabbed for the pillow and wrestled it away from Harry, then lunged forward and shoved Harry out of bed. Harry tumbled painfully onto the floor, then reached up and grabbed hold of the duvet and yanked, and Malfoy yelped and grabbed the edge of it and yanked back. Their tug-of-war was brief but vicious. Harry, having better leverage from his place on the floor, won.\n\u201cYou are a child,\u201d Malfoy shouted from the bed.\n\u201cFuck off,\u201d Harry shouted back, taking his armload of duvet out into the sitting room.\n\u201cFuck off!\u201d Malfoy echoed. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me to fuck off? You\u2019re the one who woke me up in the dead of night by trying to smother me with a pillow!\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t try to smother you with it, but I bloody well should have,\u201d Harry told him, sitting down on the sofa and angrily flipping the duvet open to cover himself. \u201cWould\u2019ve served you right. You were breathing right in my face.\u201d\n\u201cI was asleep!\u201d\n\u201cYou were annoying!\u201d\n\u201cArrgh,\u201d Malfoy said, and the bedsprings creaked as he threw himself down on the mattress. \u201cYou\u2019re an arsehole. Come back to bed.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Harry said before he\u2019d even registered it. He knew he was being ridiculous and childish, but when Malfoy started trying to order him around, digging his heels in was second nature. Especially when Malfoy tried to order him around and insulted him in the same breath.\n\u201cPotter. Stop being an arsehole and come here.\u201d\n\u201cNo. I\u2019m staying on the sofa.\u201d\n\u201cArrgh,\u201d Malfoy said again. Then, \u201cFine. Fine, you absolute shit. Have it your way.\u201d\nThere was a thud as his feet hit the floor. He stalked out of the bedroom and up to the sofa, jerked an edge of the duvet away from Harry and shoved in beside him, his body pressed up against Harry\u2019s side from shoulder to hip to knee. Harry elbowed Malfoy. Malfoy elbowed Harry back.\n\u201cStop it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to sit here until you come to your bloody senses and get back in bed where you belong.\u201d\n\u201cThen I guess we\u2019re going to be sitting here all night,\u201d Harry told him.\n\u201cFine.\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d\nThey fell asleep like that.\n- - -x- - -\nHarry woke up the following morning with a crick in his neck and Malfoy drooling onto his shoulder.\nHe made a quiet sound of disgust, then stood up. Malfoy, who\u2019d been slumped heavily against Harry\u2019s side, flopped face-first onto the sofa cushions.\n\u201cWha\u2026?\u201d Malfoy said blearily, picking himself up.\nBut Harry didn\u2019t look back as he stomped into the bathroom and shut the door.\n- - -x- - -\nBreakfast might have been a tenser affair had either of them been more awake; Harry was still groggy even by the time they took the Floo to the Ministry, and Malfoy didn\u2019t look any more alert. Thankfully, today was another full day of field work, and that gave Harry a chance to insist that they stop for coffee on the way to their new assignment. He didn\u2019t think he\u2019d have been able to manage if they\u2019d had a morning lecture today, gritty-eyed and exhausted as he was. The mere idea of listening to their instructor drone on and on made Harry yawn.\nMalfoy grumbled about stopping on the way to their assignment, but tempted by the blessed pick-me-up of a good cup of coffee, he didn\u2019t argue.\nHe did, however, make Harry pay for his drink.\nTheir assigned case that day was straightforward: an enchanted book had ended up in a Muggle bookshop, and Harry and Malfoy were to go to the shop, retrieve the book, and transport it safely back to the Ministry. Normally in a situation like this where an enchanted item ended up in the hands of a Muggle, a trained Obliviator would be deployed as well. But by sheer luck, this particular item had ended up in the hands of a Muggle whose cousin happened to be a Muggleborn witch, and he\u2019d known to contact the Ministry straight away.\nHarry pushed open the glass door of the shop, setting the string of bells tied to the top jingling merrily, and perked up a little at his first breath. There was something comforting about the way a bookshop smelled, especially ones like this that sold used books, and Harry drew in another, deeper breath as Malfoy stepped inside behind him and the door swung shut in another tinkling of bells.\n\u201cAre you taking lead on this or shall I?\u201d Harry murmured to Malfoy, who gave him a flat look and pushed him forward. \u201cRight then,\u201d he sighed. They were in a Muggle shop; Harry shouldn\u2019t have even bothered to ask. He edged deeper into the shop and raised his voice as he called out, \u201cHello?\u201d\n\u201cHello?\u201d came a voice from the back, and a moment later a short man with greying hair and enormous glasses poked his head out from behind a shelf. \u201cAre you from the Ministry? Have you come for the book?\u201d\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s us,\u201d Harry said, glancing around. The sign on the door had read \u2018Closed\u2019 but it couldn\u2019t hurt to check. \u201cIs there anyone else in here?\u201d\n\u201cNo, no. I closed the shop until this could be dealt with. Thank you for coming out so quickly.\u201d\n\u201cJust doing our jobs,\u201d Harry said. \u201cIf you\u2019ll show us the book, we\u2019ll do our best to get out of your hair as quick as we can.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s back there,\u201d the shop owner said, pointing. \u201cThe one on the floor.\u201d\nHarry led the way into the corner, where a cardboard box packed full of books sat beside a half-filled shelf. One book lay on the floor, cover lying open to the endpaper so Harry couldn\u2019t see the front.\nCautiously, he picked it up, flipping the cover shut. Uncaged read the book in large green font across the top, and then below that, The Biography of Nicolas Cage. Between the two was a large photo of the man himself, wearing a tight black tee-shirt and making a face that Harry supposed was meant to be smoldering or somesuch, but really just made him look as if he was profoundly uncomfortable. And moderately concerned. And maybe a little sad. It was a very strange expression.\nThis wasn\u2019t a magical book. Harry looked around, but didn\u2019t see another book on the floor, or anything else that was obviously wizarding. Sighing, he glanced down at the book in his hand just in time to see Nicolas Cage\u2019s eyes roll right, then left, and a manic grin spread across his face. \u201cI\u2019m like a prickly pear,\u201d he said with a sort of terrifying intensity.\nMalfoy flinched back, startled. Harry nearly dropped the book.\n\u201cHe\u2019s been doing that all day,\u201d said the shop owner from the safety of his position behind the bookshelf. \u201cUnsettling, isn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\u201cI could eat a peach for hours,\u201d Nicolas Cage said, still smiling maniacally.\nMalfoy looked up at Harry, perfectly baffled and more than a little disturbed. \u201cWho on earth is this man and why does he keep talking about fruit like that?\u201d\n\u201cThat was the plan,\u201d Nicolas Cage said sagely before Harry could answer. \u201cTo give you a boner. And now you\u2019ve got one.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Harry briskly. \u201cThat\u2019s quite enough of that.\u201d He shoved the book at Malfoy. \u201cHere, hold him a sec.\u201d\n\u201cIt keeps talking as long as someone\u2019s touching it,\u201d the shop owner helpfully pointed out.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve worked that out for ourselves, thanks,\u201d Malfoy said, and was nearly drowned out by Nicolas Cage suddenly shouting, \u201cI\u2019M A VAMPIRE!\u201d and oh dear lord, now he was flapping his arms.\n\u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d Harry said to himself, which was a tremendously unprofessional thing to say while on a case, but he hadn\u2019t had nearly enough sleep to be dealing with this. Who the fuck had done this to Nicolas Cage, and more importantly, why had they thought it was a good idea? He dug a crumpled receipt out of his pocket and Transfigured it into a clear plastic bag. He held it open to Malfoy. \u201cHere, put him in.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019M A VAMPIRE! I\u2019M A VAMPI\u2014\u201d\nMalfoy dumped him in, and Nicolas Cage\u2019s voice cut off abruptly as Harry sealed the bag with the book inside. Through the clear plastic, Harry could see that he\u2019d gone still and quiet. He breathed a sigh of relief.\nThe shop owner popped his head around the corner. \u201cIs it done?\u201d\nHarry held up the bag as Malfoy heaved a sigh of relief. \u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201d\n- - -x- - -\n\u201cMerlin, what a fucking day,\u201d Malfoy said. He looked mournfully down at his shoes, then sighed and Vanished them.\n\u201cYou can say that again,\u201d Harry groaned, and couldn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d felt so glad to be home. He kicked off his trainers and unbuttoned his robes as he headed to the bedroom to change into something more comfortable.\nAfter they\u2019d dealt with Nicolas Cage, they\u2019d returned to the Ministry and were commended for taking care of it so quickly. Then, as what Harry supposed was meant to be a reward, they\u2019d been sent immediately out on another case.\nAn enterprising young wizard had attempted to emulate the Weasley twins by creating his own line of Skiving Snackboxes and had succeeded in poisoning half his Housemates. Harry and Malfoy had gone to Hogwarts to collect statements from the affected students. It\u2019d taken all afternoon, and one of the kids had puked on Malfoy\u2019s shoes.\nAt least they\u2019d got dinner out of it. Harry had somehow managed to forget how fantastic the food at Hogwarts was. Malfoy wasn\u2019t a completely terrible cook, and Harry did all right in the kitchen. But the Hogwarts house-elves were in another league entirely.\nWhen Harry finished changing into a worn pair of jeans and his favorite Weasley jumper, he headed back out and went straight for the kitchen.\n\u201cTea?\u201d he called out.\n\u201cPlease,\u201d Malfoy replied, disappearing into the bedroom to change out of his uniform.\nHarry put the kettle on and leaned a hip against the counter, waiting for it to boil. A minute later, he heard the bedroom door open, then the dry swish-swish of Malfoy\u2019s bare feet on the floor.\n\u201cDo you feel like International Wizarding Case Law or Magical Jurisprudence tonight?\u201d Malfoy called from the sitting room. \u201cWe\u2019ve got exams for both of them next Tuesday, I\u2019ll remind you.\u201d\nHarry rolled his eyes a little bit at that. Malfoy was nearly as bad about studying as Hermione had been during school. He probably knew that Harry was already a chapter and a half behind in it, but the mere thought of his Magical Jurisprudence textbook made Harry want to knock his head against the wall. \u201cCase Law, please,\u201d he called back. \n\u201cGood choice,\u201d he heard Malfoy say to himself. Then came the thump of a heavy book hitting the coffee table, and the creak of sofa springs.\nTea and studying together in the evening had been one of the first habits they\u2019d fallen into, and by now Harry found himself looking forward to it. They didn\u2019t talk much, but having someone near him, steadily working their way through the same material as him, made it a little easier to stay focused.\nAnd in two more weeks, that would be over. Harry would be back to his own home, his own habits, his own life.\nStrange how thinking of that didn\u2019t feel like such a relief anymore.\nHe tried to tell himself that it was because he was lonely. Auror training didn\u2019t leave time for anything else, much less dating. And Harry\u2019s house felt so big with only him living in it. He tried to tell himself that it was just the comfort of living with someone in general, and not living with Malfoy specifically.\nBut sometimes when he looked at Malfoy, his heart gave a little stutter and a strange almost-painful twist went through his stomach. And it was getting harder to deny what that meant.\nThe kettle began to whistle, pulling Harry from his thoughts, and he turned to prepare the tea. A few minutes later, Harry carried the two mugs into the sitting room where Malfoy was stretched out on the sofa, and put them down on the coffee table before he picked up the Case Law book Malfoy had brought out for him. He tapped it lightly to Malfoy\u2019s toes. \u201cUp.\u201d\nMalfoy obligingly lifted his feet, propping them across Harry\u2019s lap as soon as Harry sat down. Harry dragged the throw blanket off the back of the sofa and draped it over Malfoy\u2019s bare feet, then propped his book on Malfoy\u2019s shins and settled in. Malfoy had one arm tucked beneath his head and the enormous Magical Jurisprudence book balanced on his chest, his other hand splayed across the back of it to keep it balanced. His sleeve had ridden up a little, revealing the fading bond mark around his wrist. He had a small mole on the back of his wrist, and the bond mark was now light enough that it had begun to show through.\nHarry swallowed hard and looked away, trying to focus on his own work. After a page or two, he managed to shift his brain into the right gear for studying. The rest of the flat fell away, and even the warm press of Malfoy\u2019s calves across Harry\u2019s thighs faded into the background. He made it through six sections before his eyes began to droop. Just one more and he would have done enough that he wouldn\u2019t feel too guilty about stopping there.\nHis resolve lasted until he glanced over and saw that Malfoy had let his book fall forward and was lying with it covering his face, one finger idly tapping against the spine.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to learn through osmosis, you know,\u201d Harry said.\n\u201cProbably not,\u201d came Malfoy\u2019s muffled voice from beneath the open book. \u201cBut I think I\u2019ll try it a while longer just to make sure.\u201d\nHarry snorted, and reached out to poke at Malfoy\u2019s knee. \u201cCome on, you\u2019ll be better off going to sleep and getting a good night\u2019s rest.\nMalfoy lifted the book enough to peek out at Harry. \u201cYou\u2019re done studying for the night?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry said, marking his page before he closed the book and tossed it aside. He slapped lightly at Malfoy\u2019s ankle. \u201cCome on, up.\u201d\nMalfoy let Harry up, then pushed himself to his feet and went off to shower while Harry took their empty mugs back into the kitchen. After putting them by the sink, Harry held up his right hand and inspected his wrist to see how his own mark was fading. He didn\u2019t think it would be too much longer until it had faded to a shade that would be indistinguishable from his skin. Malfoy\u2019s would probably be visible for a while longer, since he was so pale. And then it would be gone entirely, and Harry and Malfoy would be free to go their separate ways. Harry dropped his hand and sighed.\nIt was just the comfort of living with someone. That\u2019s all it was.\nYeah. Right.\n- - -x- - -\nLiving with Malfoy was difficult in a lot of ways, but having someone there with him when Harry woke up from a nightmare was a comfort from his Hogwarts years that Harry hadn\u2019t realized how much he\u2019d missed until he suddenly had it again.\nHarry came awake with a gasp, the adrenaline thundering through him forcing him halfway to sitting with his body\u2019s frantic desperation to move! before his brain caught up and he forced himself to stop.\n\u201cShit,\u201d he sighed, easing himself back down to the pillow.\nThe dream had been intense, made worse by the fact that it was part-memory. He\u2019d been back in the Room of Requirement set ablaze, Malfoy screaming at him for help from atop a teetering stack of furniture. But when Harry tried to pull him up, Malfoy kept sinking, falling closer and closer to the leaping flames, and the handfasting cord that wrapped tightly around their wrists pulled Harry down with him.\nHe could still feel the heat from the flames echoing through him, nightmare and memory twisting up until he couldn\u2019t tell which was which.\n\u201cYou\u2019re fine,\u201d Malfoy said sleepily, and Harry hadn\u2019t even noticed he was awake. He reached over and clumsily patted at Harry\u2019s shoulder. \u201cGo back to sleep.\u201d\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to wake you.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Malfoy said. Then, after a long pause, \u201cDo you need to talk about it?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Harry said. This was old trauma. He knew how to deal with it on his own, how to set it aside and push it back down.\n\u201cThank Merlin,\u201d Malfoy said with such heartfelt relief that it made Harry laugh. \u201cI\u2019m rubbish at that sort of thing.\u201d\n\u201cWell, thanks for offering anyhow,\u201d Harry said, and immediately hoped that Malfoy was too groggy to notice the genuine affection in his voice.\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it,\u201d Malfoy said through a yawn. The sheets rustled as he settled down again. \u201cI\u2019m going back to sleep now. Good night.\u201d\n\u201cGood night,\u201d Harry echoed. He listened to the sound of Malfoy\u2019s breathing grow steady and deep, and then carefully, very carefully, shifted over until his shoulder touched the warm curve of Malfoy\u2019s back.\n- - -x- - -\n\u201cSo, one week left until you get your life back,\u201d Ron said as soon as Malfoy walked away from their table. \u201cYou\u2019ve nearly made it.\u201d\nThey were out in a bar this time. Harry and Hermione liked to try a new place each time they went out, and Ron very indulgently went along with it. This one was a little more club-ish than they usually aimed for, darker and with loud music that meant they had to raise their voices to be heard.\nHarry shrugged. \u201cYeah.\u201d\nFrowning, Ron exchanged a look with Hermione, then glanced quickly over his shoulder to make sure that Malfoy wasn\u2019t back from the toilets yet even though he\u2019d been gone less than twenty seconds. \u201cYou don\u2019t sound nearly as excited about it as I thought you would.\u201d\nIt was Friday night after a very long and trying week, and Harry was enormously exhausted and a little drunk. \u201cI guess I\u2019m not,\u201d he admitted before he could think better of it.\nRon blinked at him. \u201cYou\u2019re not?\u201d\nHarry shifted in his seat. \u201cNot really? No?\u201d\nSlowly, Ron\u2019s expression slid from surprise into deep suspicion. \u201cDoes this have anything to do with Malfoy\u2019s arse?\u201d\n\u201cI should never have told you about that,\u201d Harry said.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to, mate,\u201d Ron told him. \u201cAs Malfoy so graciously pointed out the other week, I\u2019ve got eyes that work.\u201d\nHarry groaned. \u201cIs it really that obvious?\u201d He glanced nervously over his shoulder. The absolute last thing he needed was for Malfoy to come back and overhear this conversation. \u201cPlease tell me it\u2019s not that obvious.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m certain that Malfoy hasn\u2019t noticed you looking, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re worried about; his back\u2019s always to you when it happens,\u201d Hermione said helpfully.\nRon snickered into his pint glass, and Harry put his head down on the table. Hermione patted his shoulder consolingly.\n\u201cI have the worst friends,\u201d he moaned, and Hermione patted his shoulder again.\n\u201cIf by worst you mean best,\u201d Ron said, still sounding far too amused about Harry\u2019s discomfort.\n\u201cHarry!\u201d Hermione said suddenly, standing up and hauling him to his feet so suddenly that he wobbled and nearly went down. \u201cCome with me to the bar, I need another drink.\u201d\n\u201cBut you\u2019ve got\u2026\u201d he began, grabbing at the table for balance. Guess he was a little drunker than he\u2019d thought.\nBefore he could finish his sentence, Hermione picked up her glass and downed the rest of her vodka tonic in one smooth gulp.\n\u201cErm,\u201d he said as she put the glass back on the table and looped her arm through his. He looked helplessly back at Ron as Hermione dragged him away.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be back!\u201d she called over her shoulder.\nHarry turned back around just in time to see Malfoy making his way back to the table. He swayed closer as they passed by each other, his hand brushing against Harry's. His knuckles were cold against the back of Harry\u2019s hand.\nUp at the bar, Hermione flagged down the bartender and placed her order. \u201cDo you want anything?\u201d she asked Harry.\nHe glanced over his shoulder at the table where his pint sat half-full and waiting for him. Malfoy and Ron were talking, neither one of them looking entirely comfortable with the other, though they both seemed to be making an effort. Malfoy sat with his back to the wall again, as he\u2019d done the previous two times Harry had brought him out since they\u2019d been bonded, and every so often his sharp gaze swept over the Muggles around him. The bright cyan glow of a neon sign mounted on the wall above him bathed him in cool light and tinted his hair pale blue, made it look very soft and fine, and Harry's fingertips itched so badly to touch it that for an instant he thought it was the bond pulling at him. But no, he\u2019d only just touched Malfoy\u2019s hand; this was all Harry.\nMalfoy looked up just then, and their eyes met. One corner of his mouth quirked up in a small smile before he turned away again, eyes lowered demurely for an instant before he returned his attention to Ron. Harry\u2019s heart kicked against his ribs.\n\u201cHarry?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Thanks,\u201d Harry told Hermione, turning back around. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\n\u201cJust as well. Thank you,\u201d Hermione said as the bartender brought her drink over, then returned her attention to Harry. \u201cI\u2019d only have put it on your tab.\u201d\n\u201cOf course you would have,\u201d Harry said. \u201cYou know, just once I\u2019d love for someone to pay for my drinks for a change.\u201d\n\u201cAnd speaking of Malfoy,\u201d Hermione said, even though Harry hadn\u2019t mentioned him by name, and Harry groaned loudly. \u201cHow long have you fancied him?\u201d\nHarry thought about denying it, but he\u2019d already admitted that he wasn\u2019t excited for the bond to end so he didn\u2019t think any denial he attempted would be terribly convincing. And, in any case, he suspected he was a little too drunk to be lying to Hermione at all. He was pretty awful at it even when he was sober and had his wits fully about him.\n\u201cBecause you\u2019ve been looking at his arse for years,\u201d Hermione went on, \u201cbut lately you\u2019ve been looking at him.\u201d\nHarry swallowed and it took every ounce of his willpower to keep from looking back at Malfoy again. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d he said quietly.\nHe didn\u2019t think Hermione could possibly have heard him over the loud music, but he supposed that the look on his face must have said it all for him anyhow, because her amused expression softened into concern.\n\u201cThe way I see it, you\u2019ve got two choices, haven\u2019t you?\u201d she said, leaning in close. \u201cTell him, or don\u2019t tell him.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that easy\u2026\u201d he began.\nShe raised her eyebrows and stared him down. \u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d\nHarry looked back across the bar. Ron and Malfoy were still talking, and as Harry watched, Ron said something to Malfoy that made him laugh\u2014really laugh; mouth open, eyes squeezed shut, head thrown back\u2014and Ron looked surprised for a moment before he laughed, too. And in that moment, Harry felt like this was really something he could have. That the past three weeks had been the beginning of something wonderfully real. The quiet evenings spent studying together in Malfoy\u2019s flat, falling asleep each night to the soft sound of Malfoy breathing beside him, waking up each morning to sheets warmed by their shared body heat. How their lives had slowly begun to entangle, how Harry\u2019s favorite mug had its own place in Malfoy\u2019s kitchen cupboard, his books stacked together with Malfoy\u2019s on the shelf, his clothes in Malfoy\u2019s wardrobe and their toothbrushes in the same cup by the bathroom sink. It wasn\u2019t much, not yet, but it was enough to make it easy for Harry to envision more.\nAnd sometimes\u2014not often, and only for an instant\u2014Harry caught Malfoy looking at him like maybe he was thinking the same.\nThe thought was at once exhilarating and terrifying, because if this little taste of being in Malfoy\u2019s life already made Harry feel like he\u2019d been kicked in the chest, how much more would it hurt to be rejected by him?\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that easy,\u201d Harry said. \u201cBut you\u2019re right, it is that simple.\u201d\nBecause as much as rejection would hurt, Harry thought that the not knowing would be worse. If Malfoy made it clear he was uninterested, it would hurt, but then it would be over and done with in one sharp blow, and Harry would be able to start learning how to get past it. But going on like this, with this awful longing and the vague promises of maybe and someday hanging over his head, well. Harry had always done better when he had a clear path before him, hadn\u2019t he? \n\u201cSo you\u2019re going to tell him?\u201d Hermione asked with the sort of eagerness that people in happily-committed relationships always seemed to have about them when they saw their friends on the verge of pairing off as well.\n\u201cI think so,\u201d Harry said, the words sparking off a nervous flutter in the pit of his stomach. \u201cYeah, I think I am.\u201d\n\u201cShould Ron and I head off early?\u201d Hermione asked. \u201cI could make something up\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo, you don\u2019t need to do that,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say anything tonight. No, don\u2019t give me that look, I can\u2019t.\u201d\nHermione arched her eyebrows at him at that, and Harry sighed.\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he repeated. \u201cLook, the bond\u2019s not worn off completely yet. We\u2019re stuck living together until then, and if he doesn\u2019t feel the same then I don\u2019t want to make things awkward.\u201d\n\u201cAnd after that you\u2019ll still be training together, and after that you\u2019ll be working in the same department\u2026\u201d Hermione went on.\n\u201cThat\u2019s different and you know it,\u201d Harry said.\n\u201cI know,\u201d Hermione said mildly. \u201cI want to make sure you know it, too.\u201d\nHe pulled a face at her, all scrunched-up nose and furrowed brow. \u201cI do know. I\u2019m not going to let it turn into a string of excuses. I just\u2026\u201d Harry blew out a slow breath and shrugged helplessly. \u201cI think that no matter what happens, if he says yes or if he says no, being able to have a little space from each other won\u2019t be such a bad thing.\u201d\nThe corner of Hermione\u2019s mouth quirked up in the smallest hint of a smirk. \u201cThat\u2019s rather mature of you to say.\u201d\nHarry shrugged. He\u2019d seen what could happen when a couple let themselves get too close too fast, but Harry didn\u2019t like to bring up Ron and Lavender\u2019s relationship to Hermione. \u201cWell, I\u2019m in Auror training,\u201d he said instead. \u201cThey\u2019ve been pounding into our heads the importance of thinking before we act.\u201d\n\u201cRon must have missed that lesson, then,\u201d Hermione said dryly. \u201cJust the other week he let George goad him into a contest about who could stand to eat the spiciest curry, and then he was up sick half the night.\u201d\n\u201cI heard George was sick, too,\u201d Harry said. Ron had dragged himself into the Ministry the following morning still looking rather peaky, but knowing that George was just as miserable had seemed to cheer him immensely.\n\u201cYes, well,\u201d Hermione huffed. \u201cI didn\u2019t have to listen to him complain about it all night.\u201d She took a long sip of her drink, then nodded to the table. \u201cShall we?\u201d\nHarry nodded and let her lead the way back.\n\u201cPotter,\u201d Malfoy said when Harry and Hermione returned to their table. \u201cThank goodness you\u2019re back. That Muggle over there keeps making eyes at me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nMalfoy frowned. \u201cMaking eyes. You know.\u201d He raised his eyebrows significantly.\n\u201cHe looks like he\u2019s picturing Malfoy without his clothes on,\u201d Ron put in, and Malfoy glowered at him.\n\u201cFor the last time, you are not helping,\u201d he snapped, while Ron only looked more amused.\nHarry tried to glance around as subtly as he could manage, following the direction of Ron\u2019s look. Sure enough, standing near the bar very close to where Harry had been standing with Hermione was a tall man with dark hair, his half-lidded gaze fixed very intently upon Malfoy. And Ron\u2019s description had been accurate; he did indeed look like he was picturing Malfoy naked.\nFrom where the man was standing, Harry realized with a little jolt, he\u2019d have seen it a few minutes ago when Malfoy had looked across the bar and his eyes met Harry\u2019s. The man would have seen the sweet tilt of Malfoy\u2019s smile and thought it was meant for him. Harry\u2019s chest monster roared to life at the sight of this person, this stranger, looking at Malfoy like he had a claim to any part of him. Inwardly, Harry knew he was being irrational; Malfoy seemed more fed-up with the man\u2019s attention than flattered by it, and even if he had been receptive, the Statute of Secrecy meant that he wouldn\u2019t be able to show any trace of magic until the relationship became serious, and Malfoy was about as Wizarding as they came. He\u2019d never consider a partner from whom he\u2019d ever have to hide a major part of who he was. This stranger wasn't going to make Harry miss his chance with Malfoy.\nBut knowing all of that didn\u2019t stop the hot swell of jealousy that ballooned through Harry until he nearly couldn't breathe.\n\u201cMerlin, he\u2019s just not giving up, is he?\u201d Malfoy said, interrupting Harry\u2019s thoughts.\nHarry glanced over his shoulder to where the man was still watching Malfoy. \u201cNo, apparently not.\u201d\n\u201cAre all Muggles unable to take a hint?\u201d\n\u201cNo, most are a lot better than him. But there\u2019s arseholes in every bunch,\u201d he grumbled, taking another look over his shoulder. The man was still staring.\nMalfoy heaved a hugely put-upon sigh, then scooted his chair closer. \u201cPut your arm around me,\u201d he said. \u201cPretend to be my boyfriend.\u201d\n\u201cErm,\u201d said Harry, blinking.\nMalfoy frowned at him. \u201cUnless you\u2019d rather I put my arm around you.\u201d\n\u201cErm,\u201d said Harry again. \u201cWhichever you think is best.\u201d\nHe\u2019d been touching Malfoy for three weeks now; he had no idea why the idea of putting his arm around Malfoy suddenly had his heartrate kicking up, had his stomach tying itself up in pleasantly painful knots.\n\u201cPut your arm around me, then,\u201d Malfoy said, angling his shoulders closer to Harry. \u201cThat arsehole\u2019s still looking. It\u2019s probably for the best if you look like the possessive one.\u201d\nRon and Hermione were both watching him with varying levels of amusement. Harry bit back a sigh and put his arm around Malfoy\u2019s shoulders.\nAs he\u2019d feared, Malfoy was warm and solid beneath him his arm, and the rounded joint of his shoulder fit perfectly into Harry\u2019s palm. Then Malfoy leaned into Harry\u2019s side, and he put his hand on Harry\u2019s leg just above his knee, and oh, this was terrible. This was terrible and wonderful all at once.\n\u201cAll right?\u201d Malfoy asked.\n\u201cMmhm,\u201d Harry managed. He could feel his cheeks going warm. He felt too warm all over, and he hoped that Malfoy wouldn\u2019t be able to tell.\nAcross the table, Ron gave Hermione a look that read, Oh good Merlin is this really happening right now, you're seeing this too aren't you? plain as day. Hermione smiled and patted his arm, clearly telling him to just go with it. Malfoy, thankfully, seemed to have missed the nonverbal exchange entirely. Small mercies. \nWas the man still watching them? Maybe this small display of affection had been enough to dissuade him. Then Harry could let go of Malfoy and possibly escape to the toilet to splash some cold water on his face and regain his balance, and then when he returned to the table, they could go back to the innocuous foot-touching that they\u2019d been using thus far to keep the bond satisfied. Harry started to check over his shoulder, but had barely begun to turn his head when Malfoy stopped him.\n\u201cDon\u2019t look at him,\u201d Malfoy said, jamming his elbow into Harry\u2019s ribs, and Harry gave his shoulder a sharp pinch in retaliation. Malfoy elbowed him again. \u201cStop that! Good Merlin, you are as subtle as a Bludger.\u201d\n\u201cI can tell you when he\u2019s gone,\u201d Hermione offered, and Harry sent her a glare because her innocent tone of voice didn\u2019t fool him at all; he knew exactly what she was doing. \u201cThat way you won\u2019t need to check.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Malfoy said, leaning harder into Harry\u2019s side. Then he looked over at Ron. \u201cNow. As I was saying before about that International Wizarding Law lecture we had on Thursday\u2026\u201d\nHarry lost track of the conversation entirely as Malfoy\u2019s thumb moved, stroking slowly up the inside of Harry\u2019s knee, then back down, then up again. Harry\u2019s breath caught, and he glanced over at Malfoy. But Malfoy was looking across the table at Ron, fully involved in their conversation, and gave no indication at all that he was aware what his thumb was doing.\nBut he had to be aware of it. Hadn\u2019t he?\nSlowly, cautiously, and with his stomach flipping over between eager anticipation and sheer nerves, Harry moved his own thumb, rubbing gently against Malfoy shoulder, a small motion that he hoped might be interpreted as accidental. And then very nearly panicked when Malfoy pressed deliberately into the touch. A moment later, his fingers tightened around Harry\u2019s knee before his thumb stroked again.\nMalfoy knew exactly what he was doing, that much was clear. But Harry had no idea. Was Malfoy fucking with him? Or flirting with him? Or\u2026 both?\nIt could very well be both; Malfoy was exactly the sort of arsehole who would do both at once. And what did it say about Harry that he sort of liked that about him?\nHarry gave Malfoy\u2019s shoulder another gentle rub with his thumb, and was rewarded with another squeeze to his knee. Malfoy didn\u2019t miss a beat in his conversation with Ron, carrying on as if cozying up to Harry like this was nothing out of the ordinary, and Harry let himself get swept away in a series of what-ifs. Was this what it would be like to date Malfoy? If they weren\u2019t playing it up to fend off an unwanted admirer, would Malfoy still want to engage in this sort of affection in public? If this were something that Harry could have all the time, whenever he wanted, would it still spark this same flutter of excitement in the pit of his stomach? Would it still make his heart beat faster?\nIt was a while before Harry thought to check over his shoulder again, and when he did, he didn\u2019t see any sign of the man who\u2019d been eyeing up Malfoy. Harry looked right, then left, but couldn\u2019t pick him out of the crowded bar.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Harry said, letting his arm slip from around Malfoy\u2019s shoulders. \u201cI think he\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\u201cBeen gone for about twenty minutes,\u201d Hermione confirmed, taking a sip of her drink.\nHarry stared at her, frowning. \u201cYou said you\u2019d keep a lookout for us and let us know when he left.\u201d\nHermione shrugged. \u201cOops,\u201d she said, utterly unrepentant. Beside her, Ron rolled his eyes.\n\u201cYeah, thanks for that,\u201d Harry muttered. Malfoy\u2019s hand was still on his knee. Harry tried to keep as still as possible in case Malfoy didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d left it there.\n\u201cJust as well that the coast is clear,\u201d Malfoy said, glancing over at Harry. \u201cWe should probably head home.\u201d\n\u201cOh, erm. Okay,\u201d Harry said. This was much earlier than they\u2019d headed out the last two times they\u2019d gone out like this. Maybe Malfoy had plans in the morning he hadn\u2019t mentioned and wanted to make an early night of it.\nMalfoy finally removed his hand from Harry\u2019s leg, leaving it suddenly cold. Harry rubbed at the place where Malfoy\u2019s palm had been pressed, trying to erase the feeling. He\u2019d finished his own pint a few minutes ago, and Malfoy picked up his own glass to drain the last bit. Harry tried to not stare at the way Malfoy\u2019s throat worked as he swallowed, and failed miserably.\n\u201cAll right there, Harry?\u201d Ron asked, and if Harry thought he could get away with it, he would have kicked him for calling attention to Harry, because now Malfoy was watching him as well.\n\u201cFine,\u201d Harry gritted out, pushing himself to his feet. He was still a little wobbly, and Malfoy reached out to steady him with a gentle hand to his elbow. \u201cSee you Monday. Goodnight, Hermione.\u201d\nThey said goodbye to him and Malfoy, and then Malfoy led the way out of the bar.\nOutside, the sudden quiet of the street was as much of a shock as the cold night air. A few people stood clustered together under a streetlight, laughing and talking as they smoked, and Malfoy turned in the direction opposite them. Harry hurried to catch up.\n\u201cErm,\u201d Harry said. \u201cDidn\u2019t you want to go back to the alley?\u201d They\u2019d Apparated into it when they came here; he couldn\u2019t see any reason they shouldn\u2019t be using it to Disapparate home.\n\u201cI\u2019d like to walk for a bit, actually,\u201d Malfoy said, looking over at Harry. They were between streetlights, and Harry was momentarily entranced by the curve of Malfoy\u2019s brow, the straight slope of his nose, the way his eyes looked dark and gentle in the soft, shadowy light of the dim street. \u201cIf that\u2019s all right with you?\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d Harry said faintly, then gave himself a mental shake and said more firmly, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s fine.\u201d\nHe tucked his hands into his pockets and hunched down inside his jumper. He hadn\u2019t dressed for the weather, assuming they\u2019d Apparate straight here and then straight back home, and the short walk from the alley into the bar\u2019s back door wouldn\u2019t be enough time outside for him to really feel the cold. He checked over his shoulder to make sure that no Muggles were close enough to see before he took out his wand and cast. Harry sighed in pleasure as the Warming Charm took effect, slow waves of heat rippling through him before they settled around him like a warm cloak.\n\u201cWould you mind?\u201d Malfoy asked, looking expectantly at Harry.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got your own wand, you know,\u201d Harry said, but he cast another spell around Malfoy.\n\u201cOf course I do,\u201d Malfoy said, smirking a little. \u201cBut this way I haven\u2019t broken any laws. Magic in public around Muggles, Potter. For shame.\u201d\nHarry snorted and rolled his eyes. \u201cGoing to report me then?\u201d\n\u201cAnd let another Auror have all the fun of arresting you?\u201d Malfoy asked, quirking an eyebrow. \u201cHardly. And besides,\u201d He nudged at Harry\u2019s elbow with his own, \u201cyou\u2019ve made me your accomplice now, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\nHarry laughed softly and nudged him back. \u201cAlas, you\u2019ve seen through my clever plan,\u201d he said as they came to a stop at an intersection, waiting for the light to change.\nMalfoy looked at him, smiling gently amused. \u201cOf course I have. You\u2019re not so hard to read, you know.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not?\u201d Harry asked, looking over at Malfoy, his amusement fading when he saw the way Malfoy was watching him intently.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Malfoy said, his gaze dropping from Harry\u2019s eyes down to his mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re not.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a particular moment that comes right before a really good first kiss, like the eye of a storm, where the jittery nervousness had died down but the excitement hadn\u2019t quite hit him yet. All of Harry\u2019s thoughts quieted, the world around him dropped away, and all that was left was a deep sense of calm and the perfect certainty that this is going to happen.\nEvery time Harry had pictured it, he\u2019d assumed their first kiss would be something impulsive, something desperate. The sort of kiss that happened in the movies. That they\u2019d throw themselves into each other\u2019s arms and get swept away by their passions. Harry had expected kissing Malfoy to be reckless and all-consuming, something that would burn him up from the inside out.\nIt wasn\u2019t. The first touch of Malfoy\u2019s lips to his was slow and careful, almost a question. His mouth was startlingly warm against Harry\u2019s, and so soft. Something about the gentle way Malfoy kissed him lit Harry\u2019s brain into a confused mess of want, tore him between the desire for more and the desire for it to go on forever exactly like this.\nMalfoy\u2019s cold fingers were a shocking counterpoint to the heat of his mouth as he slid them around the back of Harry\u2019s neck and up into his hair. His other hand slipped around the small of Harry\u2019s back, urging him in close, and Harry went to him, his own arms going around Malfoy, his hands sliding up the warm expanse of his back. The Warming Charms Harry had cast on each of them fused in a small shimmer of magic, like two soap bubbles merging.\nThe kiss lingered on for another moment, then Malfoy gently eased away.\n\u201cAll right?\u201d Malfoy asked, his fingers rubbing lightly against the nape of Harry\u2019s neck. He was still close enough that his words brushed against Harry\u2019s mouth.\n\u201cYeah, just\u2026\u201d Harry pulled him back in and kissed him again.\nMalfoy let Harry control the pace, his lips parting sweetly as Harry pressed in. His fingers tangled in Harry\u2019s hair and tugged at it as Harry traced the curve of Malfoy\u2019s lower lip with the tip of his tongue, and then Malfoy deepened the kiss in response and then they were snogging, properly snogging, and Harry\u2019s brain spun dizzily at the first touch of Malfoy\u2019s tongue to his, scarcely able to believe that this was really happening, he was kissing Draco Malfoy.\nHe held him tighter, kissed him deeper, and Malfoy made a soft sound of encouragement as he kissed him back.\nThere was a thrill to it, kissing Malfoy in public like this. Even right out in the open, Muggle London afforded them a sort of privacy that the Wizarding section never could. In this moment, Harry was just Harry, and Malfoy was just Draco, and they were just two people who fancied each other without the tangled weight of their past dogging them every step of the way. Malfoy wasn\u2019t a Death Eater\u2019s son still working to restore his tarnished reputation, and Harry wasn\u2019t the Boy Who Lived, wasn\u2019t anyone\u2019s Savior, wasn\u2019t anything more than a boy finally kissing the person he was halfway to being in love with.\nThe low rumble of a passing lorry roused Harry enough to move them away from the street. He broke the kiss just long enough for them to stumble over to the building on the corner, tripping over the step up into a deep, shadowy doorway. Harry hauled Malfoy around and pushed him hard against the glass door of the shop. It rattled in its frame, setting off a faint jingling of bells from inside, and then they were kissing again.\nMalfoy grabbed at Harry\u2019s arse with both hands and dragged their hips together, rocking against Harry so that the beginnings of his erection rubbed over the line of Harry\u2019s hardening cock, and oh, that was even better, so Harry rocked back against him as he moved, did it again, and again, until he was fully hard and so was Malfoy and maybe this should have been awkward, rutting up against each other on a public street, but Harry\u2019s brain was so steeped in pleasure that even this was a thrill. The idea that anyone who happened to walk by could see them, could see what they were doing, only made him feel more desperate and, oh, here was the recklessness he\u2019d expected.\nMalfoy broke the kiss suddenly, dropping his head to rest on Harry\u2019s shoulders as he took Harry\u2019s hips in his hands and pushed him gently back until there was space between them.\n\u201cMerlin,\u201d he breathed, turning his face to kiss at Harry\u2019s neck.\n\u201cWhat are you\u2026?\u201d\nMalfoy\u2019s breath huffed warm against Harry\u2019s neck as he laughed. \u201cSorry. I was about to come in my trousers.\u201d\nHarry\u2019s brain nearly shorted out. \u201cOh,\u201d he managed, still reeling a little, because he\u2019d nearly made Malfoy come in his trousers. Abruptly, Harry wished he were sober for this, but honestly he didn\u2019t think that he\u2019d really be able to handle this any better if he was.\n\u201cIt\u2019s only the trousers part I object to, mind,\u201d Malfoy said, nudging his hips lightly against Harry\u2019s, sending another spark of pleasure skittering through him.\nAnd Harry was tempted, enormously tempted. There was nothing more he wanted in this moment than to take Malfoy up on his offer, to take his hands or his mouth or his arse or his cock, whatever Malfoy wanted to do to him or with him. And maybe if he\u2019d had another pint in him, he would have. But Harry wasn\u2019t quite drunk enough to override his common sense. He\u2019d meant what he\u2019d said to Hermione about wanting to take this slower.\n\u201cI want to,\u201d he said slowly, regretfully. \u201cI really do\u2014\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d Malfoy said, pushing Harry farther back. He stepped out of the doorway and back onto the pavement. \u201cThat\u2019s fine. I suppose we\u2019d best be getting home, then, oughtn\u2019t we?\u201d\nThere was something sharp in his voice, tight and hurt and maybe a little angry, and Harry panicked.\n\u201cShit,\u201d he said, jogging a few steps and catching Malfoy by the sleeve. \u201cMalfoy, wait.\u201d\nMalfoy didn\u2019t say anything, but he did come to a stop.\n\u201cI really do want to,\u201d Harry said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to. It\u2019s just that I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready to, not yet.\u201d\n\u201cNot yet?\u201d Malfoy repeated, turning back.\nHarry shook his head, then leaned in for another kiss, and could feel Malfoy\u2019s relief in the way he practically melted against Harry.\n\u201cI do like doing this, though. I\u2019d be glad to keep doing this,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThank Merlin,\u201d Malfoy breathed before he kissed him again. \u201cI thought you didn't want...\u201d\nHe didn't bother to finish his sentence before he kissed Harry again, Harry didn\u2019t know how much time passed after that, but they ended up back in the doorway, and then at some point later, Harry\u2019s Warming Charms had worn off, leaving them both shivering.\nMalfoy pushed Harry gently back again. \u201cReady to go home?\u201d he asked.\nA little flicker of excitement went through Harry at that. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cI\u2019m ready to go home.\u201d\nThey took a few minutes to compose themselves, the cold night air helping Harry\u2019s erection to fade a little before Malfoy Side-Alonged him back to his flat. Malfoy didn\u2019t step back immediately, but leaned in again, slowly, and brushed a final chaste kiss against Harry\u2019s mouth.\nHarry caught Malfoy\u2019s wrist in his hand, thumb rubbing gently over his pulse as he looked down at the fading mark, as a terrible thought occurred to him. And he knew it wasn\u2019t true, because Malfoy had said that wasn\u2019t how the bond worked. But he had to ask.\n\u201cMalfoy. Is this\u2026?\u201d Harry began, trailing off. He needed to know this, knew that it\u2019d keep gnawing at him if he didn\u2019t speak up, but a small part of him was still afraid to ask.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cThis is\u2026 I mean, what just happened. That was us, right?\u201d\nMalfoy huffed a small sound of amusement, tugged his wrist free of Harry\u2019s grasp and gently pulled Harry\u2019s arm, settling it around himself. \u201cI don\u2019t see anyone else here, do you?\u201d\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Harry said, shoving at him with his whole body. He should let go, step back and put some space between them. But he didn\u2019t want to. \u201cI mean, it wasn\u2019t the bond that made us do that?\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Malfoy said, his expression turning serious. \u201cYou mean, you\u2019re afraid that I didn\u2019t mean that. Potter.\u201d He leaned in and pressed a kiss to Harry\u2019s mouth, warm and lingering. \u201cI meant that. And I mean for it to keep happening, if you\u2019re amenable. Not because of the bond, and not because I\u2019m a little bit drunk right now.\u201d\nThat hadn\u2019t even occurred to Harry, despite still being a little bit drunk himself. \u201cOh,\u201d he said.\nMalfoy frowned a little at that. \u201cWe can talk about this again in the morning, if you\u2019d like. Or after next week. I promise you I\u2019ll feel exactly the same as I do right now.\u201d\nHarry nodded, smiling. \u201cYeah, that sounds good.\u201d\n\u201cGood, then. Well. Do you mind if I go first?\u201d Malfoy asked, gesturing toward the bathroom.\n\u201cOh, no. Go on,\u201d Harry said.\nHe waited an agonizing two minutes, trying not to listen to the soft rustle of Malfoy pulling off his shirt, the faint jingling of his belt buckle, the soft whumph of his trousers hitting the floor. Then the shower started up and Harry had his cock out and in hand in about five seconds flat.\nHe thought he probably ought to feel awkward about having a wank in the middle of Malfoy\u2019s sitting room, but he\u2019d been on edge for ages, and his desperation to come obliterated most of his sense of decorum. It only took about a dozen strokes before he was back on the edge of it. Harry squeezed himself firmly, biting down hard on his bottom lip to stifle a groan as he came, spattering come all over Malfoy\u2019s glossy floor.\nA giddy rush swept through him at that, seeing the white droplets against the dark wood. Several had landed perilously close to the rug. Well. Start as he meant to go on indeed.\nA flick of his wand took care of the mess, and he was perfectly composed and waiting patiently when Malfoy came out of the bathroom, dressed in blue and green plaid pajama bottoms and a soft white shirt. His pale skin was still flushed pink from the warmth of the shower, and he had his damp hair swept back from his face.\n\u201cAll yours,\u201d Malfoy said.\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Harry told him as he passed by, sneaking another kiss from Malfoy before he ducked into the bathroom. He hurried through his own shower, brushed his teeth and washed his face, and then hesitated before he opened the door.\nTonight, the prospect of climbing into bed with Malfoy felt like the first time all over again. Because even though he\u2019d already done this a dozen times before, it suddenly felt so much more significant.\nHarry took a breath and opened the door, and he hurried across the bedroom and slipped under the duvet before he could lose his nerve. Malfoy was already tucked under the covers, curled up on his side of the bed with his back to Harry, his hair gleaming gold in the warm light from the dragon lamp. Tonight, rather than turning over and putting his own back to Malfoy\u2019s, Harry scooted close and spooned up behind him. Malfoy hummed quietly and shifted a little, getting comfortable against him. A flick of his wand turned out the lights.\n\u201cGood night, Potter,\u201d Malfoy said from the darkness.\nHarry pressed his smile against the back of Malfoy\u2019s neck. \u201cGood night.\u201d\nAnd he was so full of sheer happiness to be holding Malfoy in his arms like this that he didn\u2019t even get upset a moment later when Malfoy pressed his cold feet against Harry\u2019s shins.\n- - -x- - -\n\nOne year later\u2026\n\nTheir second year of Auror training was even more gruelling than the first, with longer hours and heavier workloads, but Harry and Malfoy still managed to scrape together enough energy to plan a romantic night in for their one year anniversary. Which wasn\u2019t all that much different from every other night they spent together\u2014they both seemed to exist in a state of permanent exhaustion these days\u2014but Malfoy brought Harry roses, and Harry lit some candles when they sat down to dinner that night, and they had plans for some pretty spectacular sex later.\nHarry was especially looking forward to that part. It\u2019d been at least a few weeks since they\u2019d attempted anything more energetic than half-asleep morning handjobs, and Harry couldn\u2019t wait to have a go at Malfoy\u2019s arse. Or for Malfoy have a go at his. Harry knew he\u2019d get a fantastic orgasm out of it either way, so he\u2019d probably let Malfoy choose; he usually had a stronger preference than Harry did about whether he felt like topping or bottoming at any given moment.\nBut rather than take him straight to the bedroom after dinner, Malfoy detoured into the sitting room.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he said when he saw the look on Harry\u2019s face. \u201cThis\u2019ll only take a minute.\u201d\nBending over, he groped beneath the sofa until he came up with a flat gift wrapped in silver paper.\n\u201cHere,\u201d he said, holding it out to Harry.\n\u201cMalfoy,\u201d Harry said, exasperated, as he took it. \u201cI thought we said no gifts.\u201d\nMalfoy shrugged. \u201cI didn\u2019t spend money on it.\u201d\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t the point,\u201d Harry said, flipping it over in his hands and peeling up the Spell-o tape. The point had been that they were both so busy with work that they\u2019d agreed not to add another thing to their to-do lists. Harry should have known better than to take Malfoy at his word on it.\n\u201cIt's fine. I barely even went out of my way for it,\u201d Malfoy said. \u201cGo on, open it.\u201d\n\u201cI am, I am\u201d Harry grumbled, pulling the paper off it, and found himself looking at the back of a picture frame.\nBut when he flipped it over, he saw that it wasn\u2019t a picture frame; it was a shadow box. And carefully pinned to the plush blue velvet interior was a very familiar handfasting cord.\nHarry blinked down at it, then back up at Malfoy who by now looked exceedingly smug.\n\u201cIs this the same one?\u201d\n\u201cThe very same,\u201d Malfoy said, and looked impossibly smugger.\n\u201cHow on earth did you\u2026\u201d Harry began, and trailed off when it belatedly clicked what Malfoy had meant when he\u2019d said that he\u2019d barely gone out of his way to get it. \u201cOh no. Oh my god. You stole this, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\nMalfoy shrugged again, careless. \u201cIt\u2019s been sitting in Evidence for a whole year at this point. I highly doubt anyone\u2019s going to notice it\u2019s gone. Or care even if they did.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re such an arsehole,\u201d Harry said, and by now he was laughing, half in disbelief, half at Malfoy\u2019s sheer fucking nerve. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you stole this. If I were any sort of Auror, I\u2019d arrest you for it right now.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019d put a bit of a damper on our night, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Malfoy pointed out, then smirked. \u201cOr perhaps not. I can think of several things I\u2019d like to do that involve you and a good Incarcerous.\u201d\n\u201cYou arsehole,\u201d Harry said again, and tossed the shadow box aside onto the sofa. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you. Get over here and kiss me now.\u201d\nStill smirking, Malfoy obliged.\nLater, when they lay curled together warm and snug beneath the duvet, Harry nudged Malfoy.\n\u201cSo, that cord\u2026\u201d he said. \u201cDid you get it just for our anniversary?\u201d\n\u201cMm,\u201d Malfoy hummed, nuzzling at Harry\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWhy else would I have taken it?\u201d\nHarry took a slow breath. \u201cTo use? Erm, for real this time, I mean.\u201d Malfoy was quiet, and Harry rambled on. \u201cNot yet, of course. I mean, I know you wouldn\u2019t mean for us to, not right now, erm, even if you did mean, which I\u2019m not assuming you\u2026\u201d He trailed off when he felt Malfoy trembling against him, and it took him a second to work out that Malfoy was laughing silently. \u201cOh, fuck off,\u201d he grumbled, jamming an elbow into Malfoy's side.\nMalfoy gave up on laughing quietly at that point, and even through his embarrassment, the sound of his laugh lit something warm and fluttery in the pit of Harry\u2019s stomach.\n\u201cYou\u2019re still an arsehole,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBut you love me,\u201d Malfoy said, shifting up a bit to kiss at Harry\u2019s neck.\n\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Harry said, grumbling a bit but unable to keep the fondness out of his voice entirely.\nThat fondness lasted all of five seconds, until Malfoy shifted around again so he could tuck his cold feet under Harry\u2019s calf. Harry sucked in a hissing breath and went rigid, gritting his teeth through the shock of it. Groping under his pillow, he curled his fingers around his wand and aimed a Warming Charm downward to counteract Malfoy\u2019s toes. Malfoy turned his head to press a kiss against Harry\u2019s shoulder as warmth bloomed around them.\n\u201cI did think about asking you,\u201d Malfoy said after a minute.\n\u201cYou did?\u201d\n\u201cMmhm.\u201d Malfoy pulled Harry closer, holding him tight for a moment before relaxing against him again. \u201cOf course I did. But I didn\u2019t think it was the right time yet. We\u2019re both so busy right now, and it\u2019s only been a year.\u201d\nHarry took a breath and said, as calmly as he could manage, \u201cThat\u2019s very true.\u201d He hoped Malfoy couldn\u2019t hear the way his heart was thundering.\n\u201cMmhm,\u201d Malfoy said again. \u201cBut I thought it would be nice to have the option. You know, for later. If we wanted to.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry said, already thinking ahead to when they finished training next year. His hand found Draco\u2019s beneath the duvet, his chilly fingers already warming.\nNext year wasn\u2019t so far away. That'd be plenty of time for Harry to plan."
