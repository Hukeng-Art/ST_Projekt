    "text": "Xie Lian blinked up from his position, kneeling on the floor of Paradise Manor\u2019s main hall.\nWith his arms crossed, Hua Cheng stared down at him and raised a brow. It was a long, silent moment before he spoke:\n\u201cAnd you are?\u201d\nFor a moment, startled by that bored, frigid look from Hua Cheng\u2014the likes of which had only ever been directed at other people\u2014Xie Lian was speechless. Quickly gathering his wits, however, he bowed his head.\n\u201cGreetings, Chengzhu,\u201d Xie Lian said. \u201cApologies for the intrusion. I\u2019ve been gifted to you by the heavens as a\u2026\u201d\nHis voice caught.\n\u201cI mean, to\u2014\u201d\nXie Lian\u2019s cheeks suddenly felt hot, and his palms grew damp under the rope binding his arms together. Beneath Hua Cheng\u2019s piercing stare from above, he lost his cool.\n\u201cAs your,\u201d he stammered. \u201cUm, as\u2014well\u2014if you want, I\u2019ve been sent to you as\u2014I\u2019m here to be your\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\ud83e\udd6e\n\u00a0\n\u201cABSOLUTELY NOT!\u201d Feng Xin and Mu Qing shouted together, slapping their hands down on the table.\nXie Lian scrambled for his tea. \u201cCareful, you\u2019ll knock something over\u2014\u201d\n\u201cXIE LIAN!\u201d\n\u201cYOUR HIGHNESS!\u201d\n\u201cI hear you, I hear you, you don\u2019t have to shout!\u201d Xie Lian carefully cleaned off the table. \u201cWhy not? It\u2019s just San Lang.\u201d\nFeng Xin held his head. \u201cJUST San Lang? Holy shit, you really don\u2019t get it\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHe was only tame around you because it was you,\u201d Mu Qing said sharply. \u201cYou have no idea what it\u2019s like to face him when he\u2019s not doting over you. Now that he doesn\u2019t even know who you are, he\u2019ll treat you the same as everyone else.\u201d\n\u201cYou guys don\u2019t know him,\u201d Xie Lian insisted. \u201cWhether or not he knows who I am, he\u2019s not an unreasonable person. If I just explain the situation\u2014\u201d\nMu Qing stared at him like he had three heads. \u201cIf someone came up to you and said \u2018kiss me and you\u2019ll remember we were married,\u2019 would you do it?\u201d\nXie Lian was about to retort, but he was interrupted by a nearby voice:\n\u201cThey\u2019re right.\u201d\nThe three turned to see Mei Nianqing set down his cards. Yin Yu, sitting across from him, put down his cards as well.\nMu Qing rolled his eyes. \u201cWelcome to the conversation, Guoshi. Did you win?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be RUDE, young man! I stopped because I was obviously about to win, so there was no more point. Apologies, Your Highness Yin Yu, I have trouble reining in my skills sometimes.\u201d He swept the remaining cards off the table with sweaty hands. \u201cAs I was saying: they\u2019re right, Your Highness. It isn\u2019t that this ghost king of yours simply doesn\u2019t remember you, like those nice stories where you hold his hand or make his favorite food and he says, didn\u2019t you make me this congee when I was sick once?, and everything is all better. It\u2019s like you\u2019ve NEVER met.\u201d\n\u201cNot only that, Your Highness,\u201d Yin Yu added quietly. \u201cThe curse affected every ghost in ghost city, too. All he has to do is ask a fellow ghost, and they\u2019ll say you\u2019re lying.\u201d\nXie Lian put his fist to his chin, thinking deeply. \u201cBut something must have stayed, even with a curse like this. After all, he rose to power over ghost city for a reason. Wouldn\u2019t he wonder why? There must be a hole in his memory.\u201d\n\u201cAha, but that\u2019s the tricky thing about this curse!\u201d Mei Nianqing declared. \u201cIt\u2019s worse than he doesn\u2019t remember, it\u2019s that all of his memories have rearranged to fit the loss. He might think he rose to power because a heavenly official called him ugly, or because he\u2019s looking for his lost pet. Whatever works best has replaced you. If he has any statues or drawings of you around, they\u2019ll be invisible to him; there\u2019s no trace left at all.\u201d\nXie Lian nodded. \u201cI understand. And it all goes back to normal as long as we kiss?\u201d\n\u201cAs long as he kisses you,\u201d Guoshi pointed out. \u201cI know you young people just mash your faces together these days, but there\u2019s a difference when it comes to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSo I just have to make him want to be with me again,\u201d Xie Lian said slowly. \u201cThat shouldn\u2019t be so difficult, right? I know what he likes\u2026\u201d\nYin Yu nodded. \u201cBut you don\u2019t have much time. When I left, he was already making plans to invade parts of the other territories. If it goes any further, it\u2019ll be troublesome.\u201d\nThey all sat in silence for a few moments, until Xie Lian nodded.\n\u201cThen it\u2019s settled,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s only one thing we can do. Guoshi, I\u2019ll need your help.\u201d\nHe raised his head and smiled, clapping his hands together.\n\u201cYou know how to make a cursed shackle, right?\u201d\nFor the second time, Feng Xin and Mu Qing stood up again and shouted together\u2014\n\u201cABSOLUTELY NOT!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\ud83e\udd6e\n\u00a0\nNow Xie Lian was getting more and more frazzled, fixed under Hua Cheng\u2019s stare. He\u2019d rushed so much to get to this point that he\u2019d forgotten to think of the right words for it.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been sent as what,\u201d Hua Cheng said. \u201cI\u2019m running out of patience.\u201d\n\u201cAs\u2014a gift,\u201d Xie Lian said finally, and smiled. \u201cFrom the heavenly court. So that you\u2019ll spare the other territories for now.\u201d\nHua Cheng\u2019s brow went higher. \u201cWhy would I want something like you.\u201d\nThis was the part that Xie Lian dreaded most. Feeling the last of his face crumble, he took a deep breath and spoke:\n\u201cTo\u2026\u201d Xie Lian\u2019s voice cracked. \u201cTo serve you in bed?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nSlowly, with a clink of silver chains, Hua Cheng sank down to Xie Lian\u2019s eye level. Without its usual warmth, the stare of his one eye was utterly chilling.\n\u201cTo serve me in bed,\u201d he repeated.\n\u201c\u2026en,\u201d Xie Lian said, nodding. He could feel the sweat beading on the back of his neck. \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\nHua Cheng stared a moment longer. Then\u2014\n\u201cGet lost.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2014what?\u201d\n\u201cLeave, and tell the heavenly court to send a more convincing assassin next time.\u201d Hua Cheng swiped out with a long black nail, dissolving the ropes binding Xie Lian\u2019s arms, and turned to leave. \u201cYou have one hour to be out of the boundaries of ghost city before I kill you. Go before I change my mind.\u201d\nStartled, Xie Lian got to his feet. \u201cBut, San L\u2014Chengzhu, I\u2019m really not an assassin!\u201d\n\u201cThen you\u2019re a spy. Scram. I won\u2019t give you any more warnings.\u201d\n\u201cI can do other things. I don\u2019t have to serve you in bed, that\u2019s just what I was sent for. I can also cook, or help with cleaning, or teach you calligraphy. Look!\u201d He raised his neck. \u201cI have a cursed shackle, I\u2019ve been banished; I really don\u2019t have anywhere else to go.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not my problem.\u201d\nXie Lian winced like he\u2019d been stung. He\u2019d always known Hua Cheng didn\u2019t take well to begging\u2014unless, of course, the begging had come from Xie Lian; but Mu Qing had been right. He couldn\u2019t deal with Hua Cheng like he used to anymore. Seeing as an appeal to emotion would be less than useless, Xie Lian switched tactics:\n\u201cYou\u2019re spending all your energy on posturing,\u201d he said quickly. \u201cYou want to make me leave in order to send a message to the heavens that you won\u2019t negotiate with them.\u201d\nHua Cheng didn\u2019t reply to that, so Xie Lian steeled himself and steadied his voice, continuing:\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad tactic, but you\u2019re ignoring the advantages of keeping me. One, it looks powerful to own a former heavenly official. Two, it gives you a bargaining chip in case things go wrong. They sent me as a bride, not a hostage; they lose face if I get killed by you. Three, they sent me as a gift to gain your favor, so there\u2019s no agreement made. You can attack whatever you want all the same; who\u2019s going to stop you? If you\u2019re afraid I\u2019m an assassin or a spy, you can lock me away somewhere. My shackle seals my spiritual energy away, so\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSo I can do anything I want with you?\u201d Hua Cheng said dangerously.\nIt wasn\u2019t a question; it was a warning.\n\u201cEn,\u201d Xie Lian said, without hesitation. \u201cAnything.\u201d\nHua Cheng turned around, giving a humorless smile, and gestured.\n\u201cThen go to the kitchen, Your Highness, and make my evening meal.\u201d\nThe way he\u2019d said Your Highness had been all wrong, making Xie Lian\u2019s heart sink; there was no devotion in it, just disdain. Still, he nodded and bowed.\n\u201cRight away, my Lord!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\ud83e\udd6e\n\u00a0\nXie Lian hummed as he cooked, lifting the lid off the pot in the kitchen to check his progress.\nSure, Mu Qing had been right; the way Hua Cheng had talked to him was petrifying, arrogant, exactly like he\u2019d always spoken to everyone except Xie Lian. Dealing with Hua Cheng like this was certainly challenging, there was no doubt.\nHowever, Xie Lian hadn\u2019t lost heart. After all, he still had an advantage: he knew exactly what Hua Cheng liked and disliked, what amused him, what bored him. With all that knowledge in his pocket, how hard could it be to work his way back into his favor?\nFor example, he was making Hua Cheng\u2019s favorite meal, a dish Xie Lian had invented and named all by himself: Thousand Gold Come-And-Go Stew. When he\u2019d told Hua Cheng the name, he\u2019d laughed for an entire minute before tasting it, and then set the spoon down to declare: \u201cGege, you\u2019ve really outdone yourself. This is my favorite dish yet.\u201d\nGiving himself a conspiratorial smile, Xie Lian ladled a generous portion of stew into a bowl. Surely Hua Cheng\u2019s tastes hadn\u2019t changed too much?\nHis bravado lasted until he was in front of the dinner table. He\u2019d shared this table with Hua Cheng more times than he could count. Now, it was set for only one place, and Hua Cheng was waiting.\n\u201cThat took you long enough,\u201d he said. He gave a lazy but dangerous look, crossing one leg over the other. \u201cWell? Let\u2019s see it.\u201d\nXie Lian took a deep breath.\nRight. It was Hua Cheng, but it wasn\u2019t his Hua Cheng.\n\u201cOf course, Chengzhu,\u201d he said, setting down the bowl in front of him. \u201cSorry for the wait, I wanted to make sure it was perfect.\u201d\nHua Cheng only glanced at the bowl before looking back to him. \u201cOh? What is it?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s my own recipe,\u201d Xie Lian replied with a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s called Thousand Gold Come-And-Go Stew.\u201d\nHaving said that, he clasped his hands in front of him and waited.\nHua Cheng did not laugh. He didn\u2019t even chuckle. He did smile, but it was a cold smile. \u201cIs that so?\u201d\nFeeling a chill go up his spine, Xie Lian nodded. \u201cEn, en.\u201d\n\u201cTaste it.\u201d\nXie Lian blinked. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cTaste it,\u201d Hua Cheng said pleasantly. He took up a bit of stew with the spoon, then held it on. \u201cGo on.\u201d\n\u201cI already did, in the kitchen\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou either do it willingly in front of me, or I force it down your throat.\u201d\nThe realization hit Xie Lian like lightning, and then he wilted. \u201cIt\u2019s not poisoned\u2026\u201d\nHua Cheng uncrossed his legs to stand\u2014\n\u201cFine, fine, fine!\u201d Xie Lian said quickly, reaching out. \u201cI understand, it\u2019s reasonable to worry. Look, I\u2019ll try it.\u201d\nTaking the spoon from Hua Cheng, he made a show of putting the whole thing in his mouth, filling his cheeks.\n\u201cSwallow,\u201d Hua Cheng ordered softly. \u201cChin up, so I can see.\u201d\nFeeling ridiculous, Xie Lian lifted his chin and let his adam\u2019s apple roll once, then twice. The soup was still hot, making him flush as it went down his throat. Once he\u2019d finished, he wiped his mouth off with his wrist and handed back the spoon. \u201cSee?\u201d\n\u201cEn, I see.\u201d\n\u201cThen why not try some\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve used a poison that only targets ghosts,\u201d Hua Cheng went on. \u201cThat\u2019s clever, you\u2019ve thought this through. You clearly aren\u2019t stupid.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s really not poisoned\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d said Hua Cheng, and lifted one arm.\nFrom his vambrace, a single silver butterfly peeled off. It fluttered for a moment before settling on the edge of the stew. On the edge of the bowl, it flapped its wings; it was drinking.\nFor a long moment, both of them waited in silence.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nThe butterfly\u2019s wings slowed, and it fell frozen to the table.\nWhite-hot panic flashed through Xie Lian, and he took a step back, his heart pounding. He hadn\u2019t poisoned the stew, but he\u2019d forgotten to consider the effect of his cooking on anyone or anything that wasn\u2019t Hua Cheng. Having messed up like this, if he had to fight Hua Cheng with a cursed shackle, there was a possibility that he might actually\u2014\nHe spoke quickly. \u201cChengzhu! I didn\u2019t\u2014I really didn\u2019t poison it!\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Hua Cheng said calmly, his eye sharp. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to say anything.\u201d\nXie Lian\u2019s chest tightened; his hands trembled. \u201cI\u2019m not lying. You can make me drink a truth potion; I can swear on my life that it wasn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI said, you don\u2019t have to say anything.\u201d\nOut of breath, Xie Lian struggled to speak. \u201cWhy would I do something so obvious? If I was trying to poison you, why would I be so sloppy? Wouldn\u2019t I know that you\u2019d test it first? You said it yourself\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Hua Cheng said, raising his voice. \u201cStop making random excuses. I know it\u2019s not poisoned.\u201d\nXie Lian stopped short. \u201cYou know?\u201d\nLifting a finger, Hua Cheng coaxed the butterfly back up. It spun dizzily a few times before returning to his vambrace, melting back in. \u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cThe butterfly isn\u2019t dead, it just didn\u2019t like the food. It still passed the test.\u201d\nRelief washed over Xie Lian\u2019s whole body, and his legs went weak. \u201c\u2026good. Right, it\u2019s not poisoned. So why not try some, my Lord?\u201d\nIn just a few moments, Xie Lian had gone through a wide range of emotion\u2014from hope, to terror, and now back to hope. Even after all that mess, this was still Hua Cheng\u2019s favorite dish. Would it work?\nWith a disinterested look, Hua Cheng lifted the spoon and took a large portion. Leaning forward, he sipped out of it.\nXie Lian waited with bated breath. Then\u2014\nA full-body shudder went through Hua Cheng, a spasm that made him fold and lean over the side of his chair, and he spat out his mouthful in a fit of coughing.\nNo way.\n\nNo way.\n\n\nAll those times back then when Hua Cheng had said he'\nd liked his cooking, could it be that he\u2019d only been\u2014?\n\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Xie Lian fumbled out, reaching out to pat Hua Cheng on the back. \u201cAre you choking? Did you eat it too fast?\u201d\nHua Cheng didn\u2019t say anything. He\u2019d stopped coughing, but he still had his hand over his mouth.\nDrawing a fan out of his sleeve, Xie Lian snapped it open and fanned air into his face. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay\u2026what\u2019s wrong? You don\u2019t like it?\u201d\nHua Cheng held up a hand, stopping the frantic fanning. Then, he sat up again, steadying himself. \u201cSo you\u2019ve never cooked.\u201d\n\u201cI cook all the time\u2026\u201d Red with shame, Xie Lian picked up the bowl and turned to go back to the kitchen. \u201cIs there not enough salt? I can take it back and add more.\u201d\n\u201cMore salt?\u201d Hua Cheng said hoarsely, almost in disbelief.\n\u201cThen\u2014then less salt. I\u2019ll add more water to dilute it\u2014\u201d\nHua Cheng stood up. \u201cStop.\u201d\nXie Lian stopped. He heard the sound of Hua Cheng walking towards him, and stared at the floor until the familiar red robes filled his line of sight.\nHua Cheng loomed over Xie Lian for a moment, then took the bowl. \u201cThis isn\u2019t salvageable. I don\u2019t know how you ate it, but you won\u2019t be cooking again.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Xie Lian said quietly. \u201cSorry.\u201d\nHua Cheng watched him for a few moments longer.\nThen, he tilted his head back and started laughing.\nAt the sound, Xie Lian withered further. It wasn\u2019t the warm laugh he usually gave when Xie Lian had done something funny; it was the ice-cold laugh he showed off before he struck someone down. Xie Lian\u2019s lips trembled at the unfriendly sound.\n\u201cI see what this is now,\u201d Hua Cheng sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. You\u2019re just a pawn, don\u2019t you see?\u201d\n\u201cA pawn?\u201d Xie Lian said weakly.\n\u201cThey sent you to make fun of me.\u201d Hua Cheng smirked. \u201cThey really did gift you to me as a bride\u2014that is, a bride straight from the underworld. If your cooking is like this, I can\u2019t imagine what your service in bed would look like.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026!\u201d\nThat was too much. The words pierced straight through Xie Lian\u2019s chest. He\u2019d always known his cooking was bad, but\u2014was he also bad in bed? He always followed Hua Cheng\u2019s instructions, doing whatever was asked of him. Hua Cheng was so patient, even when Xie Lian was shy, always teaching him how everything worked. Recently, Xie Lian had even started initiating things on his own, and Hua Cheng had always told him how proud he was. Had that all been fake as well?\nXie Lian couldn\u2019t help it. His eyes filled with tears, and he pressed his lips together, staring at the floor.\nA finger slipped under his chin, lifting it up. With his broken expression, he faced Hua Cheng.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Hua Cheng said matter-of-factly. \u201cYou\u2019re crying.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just tired,\u201d Xie Lian replied.\nIt was true; he was exhausted. He hadn\u2019t slept well since two days ago, when Yin Yu had stopped him at the gates of ghost city and told him what had happened. One whole day had been spent hunting down the monster who\u2019d done it, then another day planning what to do next. He\u2019d barely slept.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not crying because you\u2019re tired.\u201d Hua Cheng said, amused. \u201cAre you feeling humiliated?\u201d\n\u201cNo. It\u2019s just that you said I wouldn\u2019t be able to cook again.\u201d\nAt that, Hua Cheng raised a brow. \u201cYou want to cook again? Why?\u201d\n\u201cI want to try again,\u201d Xie Lian mumbled. \u201cI want to fix it\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou want to fix it,\u201d Hua Cheng echoed, letting go of his chin.\nAs Xie Lian closed his eyes, struggling to contain his feelings, Hua Cheng paced around him, looking him up and down. The clink-clink of his footsteps was crisp in Xie Lian\u2019s ears. For the first time in his life, Xie Lian didn\u2019t find it comforting; it was frightening. He really didn\u2019t know what Hua Cheng would say next.\nFinally, Hua Cheng stopped in front of him. \u201cFine,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can try again.\u201d\nXie Lian opened his eyes and looked up, suddenly hopeful; but his hope faded when he met Hua Cheng\u2019s expression. Xie Lian knew this expression; this was the amused the look Hua Cheng gave any random new toy that he liked, whether it was a gaudy piece of jewelry he\u2019d coax Xie Lian into wearing or a gold foil palace he was about to knock down. It was the look he gave his playthings, not his god.\u00a0\nRemembering how Hua Cheng treated his playthings when he grew bored of them, Xie Lian swallowed down dread; but for now, at least, Hua Cheng still seemed entertained. Lifting a hand, he let a butterfly flutter out of his sleeve.\n\u201cFollow this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019ll take you to your room. When it\u2019s time to come out again tomorrow, it\u2019ll lead you. Don\u2019t try doing anything else. It\u2019ll keep a close watch on you.\u201d\n\u201cUnderstood,\u201d Xie Lian said, nodding wearily. \u201cThank you for your generosity, Chengzhu. Good night.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\ud83e\udd6e\n\u00a0\nLying in bed, Xie Lian snuck a peek at the butterfly.\nIt sat on the nightstand, glowing faintly, casting silvery light over the edge of the bed.\nDespite the events of the day, at the sight of the small creature, Xie Lian\u2019s heart couldn\u2019t help but melt. He remembered how the butterflies would crowd around him, ticking his cheeks and his eyelashes, settling over his shoulders. Maybe some of that hadn\u2019t changed. Everyone else was so unreasonably afraid of them, but weren\u2019t they cute little creatures at heart?\nXie Lian lifted his hand from the bed, extending a finger towards it.\nThe butterfly didn\u2019t move.\nMaybe it hadn\u2019t seen, Xie Lian thought. He reached his hand a little further, until his finger was right in front of the butterfly.\nIt still didn\u2019t move.\nMaybe it hadn\u2019t understood that it could land on him, Xie Lian thought. He rolled over a little in his bed, reaching out his other hand to try to coax it on, when\u2014\n\nShing!\n\nWith one flap of sharp silver wings, a slice of red flashed across Xie Lian\u2019s finger.\nXie Lian winced, snapping his hand back, and gazed quietly at the cut. As he watched, a drop of blood beaded up and rolled down his hand.\nSmearing it away with a sigh, Xie Lian settled down and tried to sleep.\nFor the first time in two years, Xie Lian woke up hungry the next morning.\nIt took a moment to realize why, before he sat up and remembered his situation: there was a cursed shackle around his neck. What\u2019s more, he hadn\u2019t eaten anything last night except for a spoonful of his rejected stew.\nHis stomach growled, and he felt somewhat pathetic; but something fluttered across his vision, and he looked up, cheered. \u201cOh, it\u2019s you. Good morning.\u201d\nThe butterfly settled on a bedpost, and Xie Lian smiled at it.\n\u201cSorry for startling you last night. I like butterflies too much, it was my fault. I\u2019ll ask if I want to touch next time, I won\u2019t just reach for you.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t clear whether the butterfly heard or understood, but it fluttered off the bedpost and towards the door.\n\u201cIs it time to go?\u201d Xie Lian scrambled off the bed and followed it, bare feet padding across the ground. \u201cActually, before we go, can we stop by the kitchen? I\u2019m a little\u2014\u201d\nBut he stopped short, once he came around the bed. There was a meal tray with a few buns and other breakfast foods set out on a table, next to a set of fresh white robes which had been folded neatly into a square. The butterfly settled next to it.\nAs expected, Xie Lian reasoned, this just had to be Hua Cheng\u2019s style: he tended to be impassive, but not cruel\u2014at least, when it concerned those who weren\u2019t his enemy.\nOr maybe he just wanted his new plaything to be active enough to amuse him.\nA bit morose, Xie Lian sat down to eat.\n\u00a0\n\ud83e\udd6e\n\u00a0\nWhen Xie Lian entered the main hall of paradise manor, following the silvery butterfly, Hua Cheng didn\u2019t even look in his direction. He was already sitting on the divan with one leg crossed over the other, staring out towards the entrance of the hall.\n\u201cThere you are,\u201d Hua Cheng said, without turning. \u201cCome.\u201d\nXie Lian walked up to the platform, giving a small bow. \u201cThank you for the food this morning.\u201d\nHua Cheng didn\u2019t acknowledge the gratitude, merely continuing on: \u201cThere\u2019s a few powerful ghosts coming today, hoping to forge an alliances. You\u2019re just here for looks. Don\u2019t say anything.\u201d\n\u201cUnderstood,\u201d Xie Lian said, despite the twinge of pain in his heart. When would his Hua Cheng ever have been so callous? Nursing his hurt, he walked around the divan to stand behind it.\nAt that, however, Hua Cheng glanced back. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n\u201cMe?\u201d Xie Lian pointed at himself. \u201cJust finding a place to stand\u2026\u201d\n\u201cStand?\u201d Hua Cheng said, with some amusement. \u201cYour Highness, you said it yourself yesterday, very accurately: it looks powerful to have ownership over a former heavenly official. If I own you, do you think you\u2019re going to stand?\u201d\nSpeechless, Xie Lian stared at him. \u201cThen where should I\u2026\u201d\n\u201cKneel,\u201d Hua Cheng said simply. He picked up a cushion from the divan, tossing it to the floor by his boots. \u201cHere.\u201d\nXie Lian said a silent prayer in his head: San Lang, when you get your memories back, please don\u2019t kill yourself. With that, he obediently came around and knelt by Hua Cheng\u2019s legs. It wasn\u2019t uncomfortable, only strange. He could faintly smell the leather of Hua Cheng\u2019s boots.\nBut Hua Cheng wasn\u2019t done. After a few moments, he looked down and patted his thigh. \u201cHere.\u201d\nStartled, Xie Lian looked up. \u201cHere what?\u201d\n\u201cPut your head here.\u201d\nXie Lian said another silent prayer: San Lang, when you get your memories back and try to kill yourself, at least please survive the attempt. With that, he adjusted his position and laid his head against one powerful, red-clothed thigh. This was actually quite comfortable, all things considered\u2014but he could feel his face crumbling, and it only crumbled further when a delicate hand settled over his head.\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t so bad, was it?\u201d Hua Cheng mocked, running a sharp nail over Xie Lian\u2019s cheek.\nXie Lian shook his head.\n\u201cGood. Nice and quiet,\u201d Hua Cheng said, pleased. Then, he looked up. \u201cSend the first one in.\u201d\n\u201cYes, Chengzhu!\u201d\n\u201cRight away, Chengzhu!\u201d\nXie Lian kept his ears open and his eyes half-lidded, gazing down at the scene. Anything could be useful, so he had to keep aware.\nThe first ghost was predictably cowed by Hua Cheng petting a god, stuttering and stammering his way through his opening remarks. After that, however, he launched into his proposal: he would take up defense duties in ghost city for a year in exchange for Hua Cheng killing a particularly bothersome priest.\nHua Cheng listened, barely asking any questions, giving a tap of his foot that Xie Lian had long learned to recognize as boredom. The hand that had merely settled on Xie Lian\u2019s head earlier had begun to absentmindedly pet him, much like a fine lady might caress a dog\u2014fingernails tracing through Xie Lian\u2019s hair, back and forth, again and again. Xie Lian was mortified, but he closed his eyes and held still.\n\u201cWhy would I need help defending ghost city?\u201d Hua Cheng said finally, interrupting the ghost. His patience was clearly gone.\n\u201cW-well, milord, it isn\u2019t that you don\u2019t already, but I was thinking\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou can go. Wait outside, I\u2019ll have someone send over my decision.\u201d\n\u201cTh-thank you for hearin\u2019 me out, milord! Thank you, thank you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cGet out.\u201d\nThe ghost scrambled out. Once he was gone, Hua Cheng looked over at Xie Lian. Then, without a word\u2014\nHe bent down and wrapped an arm around Xie Lian\u2019s waist, hoisting him up onto his lap.\nXie Lian froze in shock as he was dumped onto the divan. \u201cSa\u2014Chengzhu?!\u201d\n\u201cLie across the divan, put your head on my legs,\u201d Hua Cheng said. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to reach.\u201d\nSpilled across Hua Cheng, Xie Lian looked up at him in question. At the sight of Hua Cheng\u2019s blank expression, however, he quickly looked down again and tried to settle on his side, crossing his arms beneath him and turning his face turned towards the entrance of the main hall. With his head nestled into the sumptuous robes of Hua Cheng\u2019s lap like this, he couldn\u2019t see what kind of face Hua Cheng was making. \u201c\u2026like this?\u201d\nFrom Hua Cheng\u2019s voice, it was clear he was smirking. \u201cFor a heavenly official, you certainly adjust quickly to being a lap pet.\u201d\nAren\u2019t you also adjusting to this situation a little too well? Xie Lian thought helplessly. He didn\u2019t respond, though; there wasn\u2019t anything to say that would make his situation less pathetic.\nRunning a sharp fingernail down the curve of Xie Lian\u2019s cheek, Hua Cheng laughed coolly. \u201cObedient,\u201d he praised mockingly. \u201cDo you find it so comfortable, being in my lap?\u201d\nXie Lian couldn\u2019t hold back anymore. \u201cA better question: is it comfortable for y\u2014?\u201d\n\u201cShhh,\u201d Hua Cheng interrupted, then gestured to his attendant. \u201cBring in the next one.\u201d\nIf the first ghost had merely stammered at the sight of a god at Hua Cheng\u2019s feet, the second one outright went silent with shock at the sight of a god with his head on Hua Cheng\u2019s lap. Still, after a whole ten seconds of silence, he launched into his proposal: if Hua Cheng defeated a rival savage-level ghost for him, he\u2019d send over ten chests of gold.\nWhile he was explaining the details, however, Hua Cheng was clearly distracted with his new pet. He braided a section of Xie Lian\u2019s hair, coiled another section around his finger until it turned wavy, and then directed his attention towards Xie Lian\u2019s hair ribbon. After messing with it a bit, he slowly and gleefully pulled it free, seeming more like a child opening a present than a ghost king. Without the ribbon, Xie Lian\u2019s hair spilled out freely over Hua Cheng\u2019s lap.\nHe\u2019s getting distracted\u2026 Xie Lian thought, struggling to keep track of what the ghost was saying while increasingly bold hands played with him; at one point, he had to lift a lock of hair from over his eyes. At the same time, however, a faint feeling of guilt gave him pause.\n\nWhen San Lang still had his memories, was I a distraction for him, too? \n\nThere was many a time during the past year when Hua Cheng had neglected his duties, mostly in order to do things like accompany Xie Lian to the market or spent the afternoon with his head in Xie Lian\u2019s lap as he meditated. Wasn\u2019t that somewhat of a fault?\nFeeling more dejected by the second, Xie Lian barely noticed when Hua Cheng\u2019s hands found his ear, twirling his earring in place\u2014at least, until Hua Cheng spoke, completely ignoring the ghost still speaking:\n\u201cA red coral pearl,\u201d he mused.\nAt that, Xie Lian finally broke the rules. \u201cMy Lord,\u201d he whispered. \u201cThe guest\u2026\u201d\nHua Cheng didn\u2019t even look up, but he addressed the ghost: \u201cWhy would I need ten chests of gold? I have more than ten times that already in wealth.\u201d\nThe ghost dissolved into stammering. \u201cBut\u2014but I can also give\u2014\u201d\n\u201cGet out. I\u2019ll send someone with my decision.\u201d\n\u201cOf course, Chengzhu. I await your\u2014\u201d\n\u201cScram.\u201d\nThe ghost scrammed.\nDespite his position, Xie Lian couldn\u2019t help but scold him a little. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you have listened? They were important proposals.\u201d\n\u201cWere they?\u201d Hua Cheng said lazily. \u201cWould you have taken either?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Xie Lian admitted.\n\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d\nAfter a moment\u2019s thought, Xie Lian replied slowly. \u201cThe first is too risky. It\u2019s uncertain who this priest really is; if you kill him, ten more priests might replace him to come hunt down ghost city.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the second?\u201d\n\u201cThe second isn\u2019t worth it. You\u2019d be better off making an alliance with the savage-level ghost you\u2019re being asked to hunt down; if a ghost is so powerful that he\u2019s making others worry, he\u2019d make a better ally than a random ghost with a lot of gold\u2014\u201d\nAbruptly, Hua Cheng turned Xie Lian\u2019s head up to face him, holding his chin in a tight grip. With his cheeks pressed together in such a way, Xie Lian could only look up with a ridiculous expression.\n\u201cSo you make a good ornament, and you can even use your head,\u201d Hua Cheng said lazily. \u201cI\u2019m bored. What else can you do?\u201d\nXie Lian responded with a voice muffled by the strong grip on his cheeks. \u201cI can\u2026spar?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\ud83e\udd6e\n\u00a0\nUsually, the one thing that could cheer Xie Lian up was sparring, and today was no exception.\nWhen it was like this, he could pretend everything was the same; Hua Cheng\u2019s fighting style was the same as always\u2014if a little more defensive, due to his unfamiliarity with his opponent\u2014while Xie Lian, of course, knew Hua Cheng\u2019s moves like the back of his hand. The excitement in the air felt the same, too; once Hua Cheng had realized that he had a true opponent in Xie Lian, his eye flared and his movements grew more savage.\nIn fact, they were both getting worked up, building up sweat as they crossed swords in the courtyard, spinning and panting, when\u2014\nHua Cheng left an opening.\nInstinct took over, and Xie Lian was about to swing for it, but he froze.\nWhen they sparred back then, Xie Lian would stop just before hitting a vital point. It wasn\u2019t like Hua Cheng could die from a sword wound, being a ghost, but it would certainly be painful; so Hua Cheng knew to freeze when he knew the strike was coming, trusting Xie Lian to stop on time.\nWith this Hua Cheng, however, there was no such trust. Hua Cheng would definitely keep fighting, and possibly get hurt\u2014what could Xie Lian do?\nBut in the instant that Xie Lian stopped to think, all of a sudden\u2014\nSomething slammed into him at full force.\u00a0\nThe next thing he remembered was tumbling over and over, colors flying past his vision, grass hitting his robes, and then he was being pressed down to the ground with a sword beneath his chin. When his sight cleared, the only thing he saw was Hua Cheng\u2019s face; it was right above him, so near that he could see his own startled gaze reflected in that one dark eye.\n\u201cYou missed your chance,\u201d said Hua Cheng. \u201cWhy?\u201d\nXie Lian was still catching his breath. \u201cI wasn\u2019t fast enough\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou were fast enough, but you stopped.\u201d\n\u201cI could\u2019ve hurt you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m a ghost. I wouldn\u2019t die.\u201d\n\u201cIt can still hurt.\u201d\n\u201cWho cares?\u201d\nXie Lian was about to respond, but he suddenly couldn\u2019t speak. It was hard not to take note of the position they were in: Hua Cheng\u2019s body was pressing him into the ground, his leg slotted between Xie Lian\u2019s, his sword a hair away from grazing his neck, his sharp eye swallowing any hint of expression in Xie Lian\u2019s face. In a position like this, saying something like I care if you get hurt, it would be\u2026\n\u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d Xie Lian blurted out.\nHua Cheng blinked, taken aback.\n\u00a0\n\ud83e\udd6e\n\u00a0\nDinner that night was awkward.\nHua Cheng had the servants set out a variety of dishes, meats and soups and noodles of all types. It was Xie Lian\u2014trying to avoid any discussion of the prior event\u2014who was contributing to the silence by shoving food as fast as he could into his mouth.\nHua Cheng sat across from him, head propped on one hand, mostly just watching. He wasn\u2019t eating much, or really saying much, either. Every once in a while, he just handed over another dish.\nNodding in thanks, Xie Lian accepted them and kept wolfing them down. After a while, though, he couldn\u2019t keep going; he was full, and after a meal so large, he was also tired. It was only once he was nodding off, almost planting his face into the bowl in front of him, that he suddenly remembered\u2014\n\u201cWait, I was going to try to make the dish for you again,\u201d he said through a mouthful of rice, then swallowed. \u201cChengzhu, excuse me. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d\n\u201cYou won\u2019t do anything right now,\u201d Hua Cheng said languidly, his head still propped on his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re falling asleep.\u201d\n\u201cI have to try.\u201d Stubborn, Xie Lian hurried to get up.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll burn down the manor.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll keep a bucket of water\u2014\u201d\n\nSMACK!\n\nXie Lian had stood up too fast, and his vision hadn\u2019t cleared yet; he\u2019d run straight into the wall instead of the entryway. Rubbing his forehead where he\u2019d smacked it, he winced and corrected his course, when\u2014\nAn arm looped through his, holding him back. \u201cForget it,\u201d said Hua Cheng. \u201cYou must have hit the ground too hard today, don\u2019t go stumbling down the hall. You\u2019re coming with me.\u201d\n\u201cWait,\u201d Xie Lian said, as he was dragged away. \u201cI still haven\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll do that tomorrow.\u201d\nRegaining his footing, Xie Lian nodded and tried to pull his arm free, but Hua Cheng\u2019s grip was strong, and for some reason he wasn\u2019t letting go. With no other choice, Xie Lian let himself be led down the hall. At least he\u2019s well-mannered, he thought. He\u2019s leading me to my room. Except, wasn\u2019t this the wrong way? And why was Hua Cheng walking so quickly\u2014\nHua Cheng nonchalantly kicked the door of his room\u2014their room, where they\u2019d slept together every night before all this happened\u2014and led Xie Lian in.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d Xie Lian glanced up. \u201cMy Lord, isn\u2019t this your room\u2014?\u201d\nSuddenly, there was the sound of a soft breath close by; Hua Cheng had leaned over his back, sliding his hands onto his shoulders.\nXie Lian froze.\nSqueezing his shoulders, Hua Cheng whispered in his ear: \u201cDidn\u2019t you say you were here to serve me in bed?\u201d\nXie Lian\u2019s gut twisted, and a barely suppressed shiver went up his back. As always, he was weak to this kind of voice, and he couldn\u2019t help but sound timid as he responded.\n\u201c\u2026en.\u201d\nHua Cheng\u2019s hands slid down from his shoulders, settling at his waist. \u201cThen go get washed up.\u201d\nXie Lian couldn\u2019t believe his ears. He knew that Hua Cheng was insatiable, but could it be that he\u2019d really do it with a near-stranger this early? It wouldn\u2019t be that unusual in a situation with regular people; a new concubine could expect to be fucked into by an eager noble on the night of their arrival. Still, was this really Hua Cheng\u2019s style?\nIn any case, it didn\u2019t matter. This worked to Xie Lian\u2019s advantage; if there was one thing Hua Cheng liked to do during sex, it was kissing. If this could get his memories back, it would be over quickly. Swallowing down his nerves, Xie Lian raised his voice:\n\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d\nSlipping out of Hua Cheng\u2019s grasp, he went quickly behind the divider in the room, where a tub of hot water was waiting. Glancing behind him self-consciously to make sure the divider hid him well, he shucked off his clothes and stepped into the water.\nHua Cheng had seen him naked lots of times, but really, this felt more like the first time with a stranger\u2026\nIt really was like facing a stranger in more ways than one. Xie Lian had a good idea of what his Hua Cheng liked in bed, but this Hua Cheng was a mystery. There was no telling what Xie Lian would be asked to do, and no telling how patient or gentle Hua Cheng would be with him during the act. It was best not to think about it, Xie Lian reasoned; if he tried to brace himself, he\u2019d get tense, and it could hurt more.\nFeeling shy at his train of thought, Xie Lian scrubbed hard at himself, determined to get clean. If he gave a bad first impression, Hua Cheng wouldn\u2019t want to kiss him at all, and the whole plan could be in jeopardy. He was concentrating on cleaning laboriously between his toes, the water splashing back and forth in the tub, when a voice came\u2014\n\u201cMake sure to dry off completely. I don\u2019t want the bed to be damp.\u201d\nThat was his signal that he was taking too long. \u201cYes, my lord,\u201d he said quickly, stepping out. After drying off, he slipped a fresh inner robe off the divider and put it on.\nFor a moment, he looked down at himself, feeling stupid.\nThen, he stepped out.\nHua Cheng was lying in bed in his inner robe, his hands behind his head, staring up at the ceiling. \u201cWell?\u201d he said, without looking. \u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d\nTimidly approaching the bed, where he\u2019d slept so often for the past year, Xie Lian felt completely out of place for the first time. Still, he climbed up onto the plush surface and knelt. \u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d he said. \u201cHow\u2026how does my lord want to have me?\u201d\n\u201cHmmm,\u201d Hua Cheng mused.\nXie Lian waited, his heart beating hard in his ears.\nThen\u2014Hua Cheng turned over onto his front. \u201cRub my back.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u201d Xie Lian almost choked. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cMy back hurts after sparring. Don\u2019t you know how to do it?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nFor the third time that day, Xie Lian said a prayer in his head: San Lang, when you get your memories back and kill yourself successfully, at least wait by the door of the underworld so I can get you back. Still, he dutifully rolled up his sleeves and placed his hands on Hua Cheng\u2019s shoulders. His hands were delicate but strong, and he knew how to do this well. In fact, Hua Cheng had often asked for back rubs before, though they inevitably always ended in\u2026\nXie Lian flushed so red all of a sudden that his hands quivered; he tried to keep going, kneading his palms into Hua Cheng\u2019s back, when suddenly\u2014\nHis arm was being seized, and he was flipped onto his back. Hua Cheng stared down at him.\n\u201cWhy so shaky?\u201d he said pleasantly. \u201cDid you think you were going to get fucked? Were you scared?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026I wasn\u2019t scared,\u201d Xie Lian said stubbornly.\n\u201cOh?\u201d\nThickening his face, Xie Lian went on. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t done it before, it\u2019s not a big deal\u2026\u201d\nAt that, Hua Cheng raised a brow. \u201cYou\u2019ve done it before.\u201d\nRed-faced, Xie Lian nodded. \u201cI have.\u201d\n\u201cNo you haven\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean, I haven\u2019t? Yes I have.\u201d\n\u201cNo you haven\u2019t.\u201d Hua Cheng squeezed his cheeks together. \u201cLook at the state of you just from talking about it. I could fry an egg on your face.\u201d\n\u201cI can prove it,\u201d Xie Lian insisted. \u201cI\u2019ve done it lots ways. For example, I\u2019ve\u2026\u201d\nHua Cheng waited patiently.\nXie Lian\u2019s voice wouldn\u2019t come out, no matter how hard he tried. \u201cI\u2019ve\u2026put it\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIf I put it in you, you\u2019d cry.\u201d\nYou\u2019ve cried at your climax at least ten times, Xie Lian thought. Feeling woeful, he turned away. \u201cForget it.\u201d\n\u201cMn. You\u2019re embarrassed.\u201d\nHad it all been a joke? That would definitely be Hua Cheng\u2019s style, but in this situation, Xie Lian was feeling annoyed. \u201cWhy did you tell me to get washed if you weren\u2019t going to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cTwo reasons,\u201d said Hua Cheng. \u201cFirst, because I thought it was funny. Second, because my intention was to use you as a bedwarmer. You\u2019re hot after a dip in the bath, and you\u2019re burning up now that you\u2019re ashamed, so the temperature\u2019s all set.\u201d Two arms clad in black inner robes were suddenly wrapping around Xie Lian, pressing him firmly down to the bed, and he was bundled against Hua Cheng\u2019s chest. \u201cStop fussing and lie still, don\u2019t move away.\u201d\nIf he got any more humiliated, Xie Lian thought he might catch on fire. To think that he\u2019d once been a crown prince, and now he was being used as a bed stove\u2014it was too much to bear, even for him. It was only tolerable because it was Hua Cheng; thinking about him being cold made Xie Lian\u2019s heart soft.\nStill, he shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re really\u2026\u201d\n\u201cShhh. I\u2019ll gag you if you keep talking.\u201d\nRelenting, Xie Lian went silent. He closed his eyes.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nBut then his eyes snapped open\u2014he\u2019d forgotten something!\nSlipping his hand into his sleeve, he pulled out a small hard candy. Before he could raise his arm, however\u2014\n\u201cDon\u2019t move around. I\u2019ll tie you up.\u201d\n\u201cJust\u2026let me adjust my position.\u201d\n\u201cMn.\u201d\nSquirming in Hua Cheng\u2019s grip, Xie Lian managed to secretly pop the candy in his mouth. With that, he pressed back against Hua Cheng to reassure him and avoid suspicion\u2014the very image of an obedient bedwarmer\u2014and spoke softly. \u201cThat\u2019s better. I\u2019m ready, my lord. Did you want me to sing you something as you fall asleep?\u201d\nFor once, Hua Cheng didn\u2019t say anything, though the muscles of his abdomen seemed to twitch against Xie Lian\u2019s back. Then, a little roughly: \u201cNo. Go to sleep.\u201d\n\u201cEn, en. Good night.\u201d\nXie Lian waited until Hua Cheng had stopped moving, then swallowed the candy down. After a few moments, he felt a little spiritual energy return, and called out in an array:\n\u201cHi, everyone. Sorry I\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYOUR HIGHNESS, WHAT THE FUCK!\u201d Feng Xin roared.\nMu Qing sounded tense. \u201cXie Lian! Where were you?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s all this racket, this Guoshi is trying to sleep\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYour Highness, was there a problem?\u201d Yin Yu said. \u201cWe got worried when we didn\u2019t hear from you yesterday.\u201d\nFeng Xin kept swearing. \u201cI THOUGHT YOUR FUCKING RIBBON WAS GOING TO STRANGLE ME TO DEATH\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m fine!\u201d Xie Lian said hurriedly. \u201cI was just busy.\u201d\n\u201cJust busy?\u201d Mu Qing said in disbelief. \u201cWe agreed you\u2019d reach out yesterday. We were about to send someone to come get you. For all we knew, you could\u2019ve been dead.\u201d\n\u201cShhh\u2026ten more minutes,\u201d Mei Nianqing mumbled.\nXie Lian sighed. \u201cAll right, everybody stop. I\u2019m sorry I forgot, but you can scold me later; the spiritual energy candy won\u2019t last long.\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d said Mu Qing. \u201cDid you at least get any closer to getting his memories back?\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026he let me stay with him, but, as for getting him to kiss me\u2026\u201d Xie Lian\u2019s heart sank a little as he thought over the events of the past two days. \u201cI made him food that he didn\u2019t like, I distracted him from his work, I was too weak when sparring with him, I forgot to make him dinner, and then I annoyed him while he was trying to fall asleep.\u201d\nHe paused, feeling a lump in his throat.\n\u201cI guess I\u2019m not as good as making him happy as I thought.\u201d\n\u201cXie Lian, for fuck\u2019s sake.\u201d Mu Qing\u2019s eye-roll was practically audible. \u201cIf you\u2019re alive it means he doesn\u2019t hate you, and that\u2019s already hard to get. Stop being dramatic.\u201d\nDo you usually make people hate you at first glance? Xie Lian thought, but held his tongue. In any case, another voice interrupted:\n\u201cAhhh,\u201d Mei Nianqing said groggily, in a tone conveying that he was stroking a non-existent beard. \u201cI see what this is.\u201d\nXie Lian felt a little annoyed. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou think that the only reason he became obsessed with you initially was because you caught him during the parade back in Xianle. In fact\u2014you think that the only reason someone could become so terrifying about you is if you save their life. Absent that, you don\u2019t think the same kind of love is possible.\u201d\nXie Lian\u2019s heart was sunk deep in his stomach. \u201c\u2026is it unreasonable to think that?\u201d\n\u201cSigh, just as I thought: young people really don\u2019t know anything about love. Fortunately for you, your Guoshi will tell you: back in the time of Wuyong\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIs there any progress, though?\u201d Feng Xin interrupted. \u201cWhat about that? If you think of something that\u2019s gone well, maybe you can follow that lead.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d Xie Lian mumbled. \u201cWait! There actually is some good news: I went to bed with him tonight!\u201d\nAll of a sudden, there was dead silence on the other end of the line.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI mean\u2014n-n-not like that,\u201d Xie Lian said quickly. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do\u2014that. He just said that he\u2019d use me as a bedwarmer, and also, he wanted a massage. But we didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to sleep,\u201d said Mu Qing, and immediately left the array.\n\u201cUm, I\u2019m, yeah, me too,\u201d Feng Xin fumbled out. \u201cI\u2019m going to bed. To sleep, I mean. Good night, Your Highness, good luck.\u201d Then, he was gone, too.\nYin Yu silently left as well.\nMei Nianqing let out a loud snore into the array, so Xie Lian sighed and left on his own. With that, he was alone in his room again, and he closed his eyes to sleep.\nAs he drifted off, however, he could\u2019ve sworn he felt something flutter past his cheek.\nWhen Xie Lian woke up, there was a precious moment of dreamy amnesia. Surely it had all been a nightmare; he was waking up in Hua Cheng\u2019s arms as usual, and the morning felt cool and sweet. Shouldn\u2019t this be just another morning?\nThen he felt a tickle on his lashes, and he opened his eyes to the sight of the butterfly sentry barely a hair from his eyes, perched on his face.\nSuppressing his shock, Xie Lian held still. He still remembered the burn of a silver wing slicing across his hand the first night, and knew that provoking it while it was so near to his eyes was probably a bad idea.\nThis time, though, nothing happened.\nCarefully slipping his hand out from under Hua Cheng\u2019s arm, Xie Lian nudged the butterfly onto his finger. With a sigh of relief, he watched it flap its wings peacefully. \u201cAt least I\u2019m not a bother to you,\u201d he said quietly, then sat up and slipped out of bed.\nRubbing sleep out of his eyes, he glanced over at Hua Cheng; like this, peacefully asleep, he could\u2019ve been the same ghost king he\u2019d shared a beautiful year with. Now, though\u2026\nShaking his head, Xie Lian turned away and headed towards the kitchen.\nHe hadn\u2019t done well the past two days, but there was a chance to fix it. Cooking was a sure way into anyone\u2019s heart; maybe the Thousand Gold Come-And-Go Stew had been too complicated, too hard to rush under pressure. A simple bowl of congee could do just as well.\nThe silver butterfly tracked him as he went, then settled on his shoulder as he worked. Despite his initial wariness, Xie Lian saw it wasn\u2019t standoffish anymore, but he still murmured to it when he started stirring: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you perch somewhere else for a second? I don\u2019t want to knock you over.\u201d\nWith a flutter of wings, it flew away.\nThat\u2019s weird, Xie Lian thought absentmindedly, as he peered down into the congee, which for some reason had begun to emit smoke. If I just told it to move, why did it fly away? Before he could look up to see, however\u2014\nSomething much, much heavier settled over his shoulders. Xie Lian froze.\n\u201cI was woken up by the chill this morning,\u201d Hua Cheng said. \u201cMornings are coldest. I didn\u2019t tell you to leave.\u201d\nPutting down the spoon, Xie Lian hastily tried to turn and bow. \u201cMy apologies, Chengzhu. I thought\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t turn around. You\u2019re cooking now, so you can keep cooking. What is it?\u201d\n\u201cCongee,\u201d Xie Lian said, picking his spoon back up. \u201cIt\u2019s almost done, do you want some?\u201d\nHua Cheng stepped back, leaning his hip against the counter, and crossed his arms in front of him. He was already dressed in a blood-red outer coat, imposing and smooth; Xie Lian, in an inner robe now stained with soy sauce and oil, felt small in contrast.\n\u201cWell?\u201d Hua Cheng said. \u201cI\u2019m waiting.\u201d\nSnapping out of his haze, Xie Lian quickly scooped some up before holding out the spoon. \u201cHere. Try, try.\u201d\nBut when Hua Cheng made no move to reach out, Xie Lian realized he wanted to be fed directly. Flushing with embarrassment, he lifted the spoon higher. \u201cHere\u2026\u201d\nHua Cheng leaned forward, taking a sip from it, and leaned back to chew.\nThat's  already a bad sign. Since when is congee chewy\u2026\nStill, Xie Lian held onto hope. \u201cIs it\u2026\u201d\nAfter crunching on it for a bit, Hua Cheng swallowed. Then, he shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s not good, Your Highness.\u201d\nXie Lian\u2019s spirits fell. He couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d failed again. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d\nLeaning over the pot, Hua Cheng gazed down. \u201cThe rice isn\u2019t fully cooked. You probably either didn\u2019t stir enough or didn\u2019t heat it enough. Otherwise, the taste would\u2019ve been fine.\u201d\nThen\u2014\nHua Cheng reached into the pot with his hand?!\n\u201cMy lord? Why are you mnnghh\u2014\u201d\nTwo slender fingers had been pushed past Xie Lian\u2019s lips, into the hot inside of his mouth.\n\u201cSuck,\u201d Hua Cheng said simply.\nXie Lian stared at him, feeling like something hot and throbbing was sinking down into his stomach.\n\u201cI said suck,\u201d Hua Cheng repeated. \u201cDon\u2019t bite down, just suck like it\u2019s candy.\u201d\nDespite his bewilderment, Xie Lian closed his lips and suckled dutifully. The nails were smooth and sharp against his palate, but the skin of the fingers was soft as it rubbed against his tongue.\n\u201cSee?\u201d Hua Cheng said, staring right at him, deadly-sharp. \u201cThe ingredients taste fine. It\u2019s only a problem with the rice.\u201d\n\u201cMm,\u201d Xie Lian agreed. With that, one could reasonably expect that Hua Cheng would pull his hand away\u2014at least, Xie Lian did.\nHe never expected Hua Cheng to suddenly sink them in deeper.\nXie Lian startled, one hand reaching up to grasp Hua Cheng\u2019s arm. \u201cMmmngh\u2014?!\u201d\n\u201cShhh,\u201d Hua Cheng said quietly. His one eye was burning. \u201cDon\u2019t fuss. Just finish cleaning off my fingers.\u201d\nWith a clumsy nod, Xie Lian used his tongue as best as he could. Once the taste of spices was gone, he swallowed to show he was done and glanced up, meeting Hua Cheng\u2019s fixed gaze.\nFinally, Hua Cheng pulled his fingers out. \u201cGood,\u201d he said, and turned away. \u201cMeet me at the table. I had the servants set out breakfast. I have a few questions for you.\u201d\n\u201cYes, Chengzhu\u2014\u201d\nHe was gone.\nIn the moment the door slid shut, Xie Lian stumbled back against the counter, breathing shallowly. He could still taste Hua Cheng on his tongue.\nYou did all that just to make a point about cooking? he thought dryly. San Lang, who knew you\u2019d be this repressed after just a few days without\u2026\n\n\u00a0\n\n\ud83e\udd6e\n\n\u00a0\n\nTo his credit, Hua Cheng let Xie Lian eat in silence for a few minutes before starting to question him.\n\u201cI\u2019ve looked through my records, but I can\u2019t find anything about you,\u201d Hua Cheng said. \u201cI want to know where you\u2019re from.\u201d\nPractically choking on his food, Xie Lian looked up. \u201cI\u2019m from Xianle. Aren\u2019t you from Xianle?\u201d\nHua Cheng seemed impatient. \u201cJust answer the question.\u201d\n\u201cIf you ask questions, I should be able to ask questions. Isn\u2019t it nicer to have a conversation like that? Yes, I\u2019m from Xianle. What about you?\u201d\n\u201cEn,\u201d said Hua Cheng. \u201cWhat were you in Xianle?\u201d\n\u201cI was the crown prince,\u201d said Xie Lian. \u201cI ascended, but descended again to help my kingdom. When that failed, I turned into a banished god. My turn: what\u2019s your purpose as a ghost?\u201d\n\u201cTo seek my fate,\u201d said Hua Cheng. \u201cMy turn again. Why did Xianle fall?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2026you don\u2019t know?\u201d\n\u201cI was never able to find any records on it. I died before it happened.\u201d\n\u201cIt was more than one reason,\u201d said Xie Lian. \u201cFirst a drought, and then a devastation-level ghost named the White-Clothed Calamity. Do you know about him, at least?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s fine. He\u2019s gone now,\u201d said Xie Lian. \u201cMy turn again: what do you mean, your purpose is to seek your fate?\u201d\nHua Cheng took a sip of tea, seeming unfazed. \u201cWhen I was young, I threw myself from a city wall; I was saved by chance when I fell into a passing flower cart. Since then, I\u2019ve known luck was on my side, and I\u2019ve been following my fate wherever it leads me ever since.\u201d\n\u201cThat alone gave you the strength to go on?\u201d\nWith a shrug, Hua Cheng leaned back in his chair. \u201cEveryone picks something to follow. Why shouldn\u2019t I follow fate?\u201d\nIt\u2019s like he never needed me in the first place, Xie Lian thought to himself. Even though he tried to convince himself it was just the curse, he still felt bittersweet. \u201cIs that why you\u2019re thinking of invading other territories?\u201d\n\u201cWhy not? If I\u2019m strong enough, it\u2019s my right.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026would that make you happy?\u201d\nHua Cheng stared at him for a long moment, making Xie Lian uncomfortable. Xie Lian turned his gaze back down to his food and mumbled through a large mouthful:\n\u201cSorry, that was too personal\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhat about you?\u201d said Hua Cheng. \u201cWhat would make you happy?\u201d\nSwallowing his mouthful, Xie Lian sighed wistfully. \u201cThere\u2019s someone I\u2019d like to be reunited with. It might be impossible, but\u2026\u201d\nNarrowing his eyes, Hua Cheng interrupted. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible. You\u2019re here now; you can forget about things like that.\u201d\nUntil you get bored of me, Xie Lian thought to himself, and nodded.\nThere was an awkward silence while Xie Lian went on eating, letting the odd moment linger in the air. Finally, he looked up. \u201cDo you have any more ghosts coming to meet with you today?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not accepting any today.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d Xie Lian looked up. \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel like it.\u201d\n\u201cSa\u2014Chengzhu, you should know it\u2019s important to take requests. They\u2019re good ways to show your power; if the city feels like you aren\u2019t paying attention\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about that,\u201d said Hua Cheng. \u201cTalk about something else.\u201d\n\u201cAbout\u2014what?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Pick something and talk.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\n\ud83e\udd6e\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to plant a lotus, but not impossible,\u201d Xie Lian said, reaching deep into the bucket in front of him. \u201cIt\u2019s all about getting the right consistency of mud. If the dirt is too light, it\u2019ll float away; you want something thick.\u201d\nHua Cheng handed over the sprouted tuber. \u201cBut it can\u2019t be planted in the dirt outside?\u201d\n\u201cNot really, since it needs water over the dirt.\u201d Xie Lian took the tuber and pressed it down. \u201cSee this? Just make sure it\u2019s nice and buried\u2014\u201d He let out a small noise of effort, as he pressed it down. \u201cThen pour some water over it.\u201d\nPicking up the jug at their side, Hua Cheng let some water flow. \u201cHow much?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you when to stop. More, more, more\u2026now! See how the last leaf is peeking over the top of the water?\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cEasy, right? Now you just let it sit in the sun. I made a lot of money planting them and selling them off, back when I was wandering from place to place; they look great in ponds for wealthy households. As long as you\u2019re not afraid to get mud under your fingernails, it\u2019s a good source of money.\u201d Shaking the water off his hands, Xie Lian gave a beaming smile. \u201cIt\u2019s also rewarding to see the flowers come up.\u201d\nHua Cheng paused to stare when Xie Lian smiled, almost dazed. \u201c\u2026en.\u201d\n\u201cWhen it\u2019s sprouted, you can put it in the pond in the courtyard. Then, you can go to ghost city and buy some fish, and it\u2019s a great place for meditation.\u201d\nHua Cheng seemed to snap out of whatever thought he\u2019d been having, and snorted through his nose. \u201cMeditation?\u201d\n\u201cYou really should meditate every day. It clears the mind and the senses\u2014ah, thank you.\u201d\nReaching over, Hua Cheng had started to wipe off Xie Lian\u2019s hands with a towel. \u201cI don\u2019t think sitting around like that would do much for me.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, that\u2019s true,\u201d said Xie Lian. \u201cThen, instead of sitting still, how about movement meditation?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\ud83e\udd6e\n\u00a0\n\u201cJust like that\u2026move your arm up a little\u2026\u201d Xie Lian moved around Hua Cheng, correcting his form, adjusting it with delicate hands. \u201cThere\u2026perfect.\u201d He came to stand in front of him. \u201cNow, just copy exactly what I do.\u201d\nThe two moved together, mirroring each other, flowing through a set of positions. Xie Lian\u2019s movements were practiced, light and airy; Hua Cheng\u2019s were forceful, but deadly with their precision.\n\u201cSee?\u201d Xie Lian smiled, as he came to a stop. \u201cCan you feel the way the energy shifts through your body?\u201d\nHua Cheng stopped too, and stared at Xie Lian\u2019s face. He seemed to be doing that a lot. \u201cI felt it this time. It\u2019s faint, but it\u2019s noticeable.\u201d\n\u201cThe more you practice, the better you get at it. I\u2019ve noticed that ghosts tend to use energy through brute force, but control is just as important as power. If you do this just a few minutes every day, you\u2019ll gain a finer touch.\u201d\n\u201cYour Highness,\u201d Hua Cheng said, with a dangerous gleam in his eye. \u201cWhen I have enemies, they aren\u2019t scared away by a finer touch.\u201d\n\u201cWell, if all you want to do is scare enemies, then that\u2019s just fine,\u201d Xie Lian quipped, and then stopped suddenly. His face went pale; he\u2019d accidentally slipped back into the tone he\u2019d used before this incident, whenever Hua Cheng was being unruly\u2014too casual. \u201c\u2026sorry, I\u2019m lecturing. Actually, I\u2019ve been talking nonstop all day, how embarrassing.\u201d Xie Lian wiped sweat from his forehead, setting down the pole in his hands. \u201cIf it\u2019s boring, we can stop.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d\nNot only did I mess up breakfast this morning and then interrogate him, I basically got him covered in mud and lectured him all day after that, Xie Lian thought to himself. Wincing, he turned away. \u201cI can go clean for a while. If you have other important things to do\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d Hua Cheng said softly.\nXie Lian froze.\nThere was the usual clink, clink of Hua Cheng slowly approaching.\nThese past days, Xie Lian had learned that he never had any clue what was about to happen next, so he took a deep and steadying breath. Either from the exercise just now or from nerves, a bead of sweat rolled down his neck.\nThen, one hand grasped his shoulder, and another grasped his head, tilting them apart, and\u2014\nSomething hot and wet ran up his neck, ending just beneath his ear\nXie Lian\u2019s eyes were wide-open. \u201c\u2026my lord?\u201d\n\u201cJust curious,\u201d Hua Cheng replied casually. \u201cI\u2019ve never tasted a cursed shackle.\u201d\nThat wasn\u2019t the shackle, that was basically half my neck\u2026 Xie Lian thought. Still, he didn\u2019t move until Hua Cheng released him.\n\u201cThe servants should have set out dinner for you. Eat, then wait for me in my room.\u201d\n\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d Xie Lian nodded. \u201cDid you want me to warm up for bed?\u201d\n\u201cNo, not yet. First, you\u2019re going to give me a calligraphy lesson.\u201d\nXie Lian was surprised. \u201cAnother lesson?\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you could teach me calligraphy?\u201d Hua Cheng turned to go. \u201cGo eat. I\u2019ll have the materials set up when you arrive.\"\n\u00a0\n\ud83e\udd6e\n\u00a0\nWhen Xie Lian entered the room, Hua Cheng was already there, sitting next to the table with calligraphy supplies laid out. He was clearly feeling impatient, twirling one of the brushes in his hand. His impatience became more noticeable when Xie Lian entered; instead of addressing him without looking like he usually did, Hua Cheng turned and stared. \u201cThere you are. Did you get lost?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d Xie Lian said, kneeling down by the table. He set a small pot on the table, then a small bowl with a spoon. \u201cI just spent some time trying to make this again for you. I used less salt this time.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d Hua Cheng replied lazily. \u201cThe Thousand Gold Come-And-Go Stew?\u201d\nXie Lian\u2019s hand, which was just lifting the lid off the pot, hesitated for a second. It must have been really terrible if he even remembers the name, he thought. Still, determined not to be discouraged, he nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Won\u2019t you try some?\u201d\nHe was about to reach out and serve a bowl, but before he could, Hua Cheng reached out himself. After measuring out a hefty portion into the bowl, he lifted it to his lips for a taste.\nWith bated breath, Xie Lian watched. \u201cIs it better?\u201d\nHua Cheng swallowed, then tilted his head. \u201cIt does have less salt, so it\u2019s not as bad, but there\u2019s still a problem with the vegetables. They were cooked for too long. Next time, you have to make sure they still hold their shape.\u201d\nHis heart sinking, Xie Lian nodded. \u201cI see.\u201d\nTaking up another spoonful, Hua Cheng nodded towards the table. \u201cSit. I\u2019ve set out the supplies.\u201d\nWas it possible that he could mess up calligraphy too? Given his luck the past few days, Xie Lian thought, it was definitely possible. He was just picking up a brush when he realized he still heard the scraping of the spoon against the bowl, and looked up. \u201c\u2026you don\u2019t have to finish it if it\u2019s bad\u2026\u201d\nHua Cheng set down his bowl; it was empty. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, I\u2019m done anyway. Show me your technique.\u201d\nDespite feeling discouraged, Xie Lian waved him along. \u201cShow me how you hold the brush first.\u201d\nFor a while, he lectured Hua Cheng and watched him write. It seemed that whatever Xie Lian had taught him over the previous year had stayed; but when Xie Lian asked who\u2019d taught him last, he named a random calligraphy teacher. What\u2019s more, when Xie Lian asked about the writing on his arm\u2014\n\u201cIt\u2019s just lines,\u201d said Hua Cheng. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d\nSo Xie Lian just sighed, and continued lecturing.\nAfter a while, Xie Lian was just writing on his own. Hua Cheng had asked to watch how he did it, and so he kept on painting, steadying his wrist with his hand. Hua Cheng stared with his cheek propped on his hand.\nXie Lian glanced over. \u201c\u2026are you learning?\u201d\n\u201cEn,\u201d said Hua Cheng. He didn\u2019t seem to be looking at the paper; he seemed to be looking at Xie Lian.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Xie Lian, resuming his work. \u201cThen I\u2019ll keep going.\u201d\nOut of the corner of his eye, though, he could sense that Hua Cheng was getting fidgety, twirling a brush, playing with his braid, then adding some incense to the burner at the side.\nDeep in focus, Xie Lian didn\u2019t expect the smoke; so when the new scent tickled his nose, he sneezed:\n\u201cHa-ch!\u201d\nHua Cheng paused like he\u2019d been startled. One hand twitched.\nXie Lian rubbed his nose. \u201cSorry, my lord. Where was I ah\u2014!\u201d\nSomething had caught his arm, and then he was tumbling down to the rug. Of course, it just had to have been Hua Cheng who\u2019d pulled him down, and now loomed over him.\n\u201cThe ink,\u201d Xie Lian said quickly, glancing to the side. \u201cI dropped the brush, it fell onto the carpet. Quickly, let\u2019s get it before it in\u2014\u201d\nA gentle but firm hand took his chin, turning it back up. Hua Cheng was staring down at him, pinning Xie Lian\u2019s wrist with his other hand.\n\u201cYou\u2019re lucky I\u2019m the one they sent you to,\u201d he said, and rubbed a few circles into Xie Lian\u2019s cheek with his thumb. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky they didn\u2019t send you to anyone else.\u201d\nResigning himself to being toyed with yet again, Xie Lian laid still and waited.\nHua Cheng leaned closer, his eye gleaming in the candlelight. \u201cA tender little god like you\u2014any other ghost, and you\u2019d be eaten up by now.\u201d\nXie Lian frowned, a bit offended. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I can\u2019t fight\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou seem like you\u2019re usually intelligent, so it surprises me when you do something this foolish,\u201d Hua Cheng murmured, clearly amused. \u201cYou slept in my arms yesterday; you were there all night. I could\u2019ve done anything. Don\u2019t you realize you could\u2019ve woken up already getting boiled?\u201d\nWith a jolt, Xie Lian realized that Hua Cheng wasn\u2019t just messing around; he was scolding him for being careless\u2014and he was right. Hua Cheng without his memories of Xie Lian was completely unpredictable. Xie Lian had been so fixated on not appearing threatening to him, he\u2019d forgotten that this Hua Cheng could be a threat. Thinking about how irresponsible he\u2019d been, he felt ashamed.\n\u201cThank you for not harming me while I slept,\u201d he said softly, and meant it. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking.\u201d\nBut Hua Cheng raised his brows. \u201cWhy are you thanking me? Who says I won\u2019t?\u201d\nA little wary, Xie Lian eyed him. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you have done it already?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe I just wanted to have fun first.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026are you having fun?\u201d Xie Lian said slowly.\nHua Cheng didn\u2019t answer, only sighed. \u201cYour Highness, Your Highness,\u201d he said, and clicked his tongue. \u201cWhat should I do with you?\u201d\nDespite the haze that was coming over his mind, Xie Lian took stock of the situation: Hua Cheng was clearly feeling playful. If there was a time to get nearer to a kiss, it would be now. He just had to make himself appealing.\nThickening his face as much as he could, Xie Lian took a deep breath before sacrificing his last scrap of dignity:\n\u201cSince gege took me in,\u201d he whispered, \u201cHe can do anything he wants.\u201d\nHua Cheng\u2019s eye lit up, blazing with something absolutely primal.\nXie Lian couldn\u2019t believe it. So you can forget all about me, but you still keep the gege fetish\u2014\nBut any further thoughts were interrupted by Hua Cheng pressing him down harder, barely able to hold himself back. His voice was quivering and low; his look was savage. \u201cDo you know where you\u2019re headed if you say things like that, Your Highness?\u201d\nXie Lian just stared up. \u201cI know.\u201d\n\u201cBut I thought Your Highness told me this morning: he\u2019s waiting to be reunited with someone.\u201d\nXie Lian shook his head. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say it yourself? I\u2019m here now, so there\u2019s no need to wait anymore.\u201d\nThat was it. Any last bit of patience was nearly gone; Hua Cheng\u2019s voice was dark. \u201cBeg me to set you free. Go on.\u201d\n\u201cYou already gave me that choice. Didn\u2019t I stay?\u201d\n\u201cBeg.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to devour you.\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d\n\u201cI eat tender little gods who try to cook for me and fall asleep in my bed. I boil them alive.\u201d\n\u201cNow you\u2019re just making fun of me\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIf they also ask to sing me lullabies and teach me to grow lotus flowers, I don\u2019t even boil them. I eat them raw while they cry out.\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t cry out,\u201d Xie Lian said stubbornly.\nFor a moment, Hua Cheng said nothing. Then, he ran a finger across Xie Lian\u2019s lower lip.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said, gazing down. \u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d\nXie Lian swallowed. Hua Cheng\u2019s gaze followed the movement of his throat as it rolled, before finding Xie Lian\u2019s eyes again.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to let you go,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cWhen I do, go kneel at the edge of the bed.\u201d\n.\n.\n.\nSlowly, Hua Cheng got up.\nIt took Xie Lian a few moments to register what was about to happen; he stayed on the floor like a starfish, staring up dazed and red-faced. Just now, he\u2019d sounded so confident\u2014he had no idea where the words had come from, like he was the most cunning member of the harem. Could he really follow through?!\nHua Cheng\u2019s voice came, clearly amused. \u201cAre you just going to lie there?\u201d\n\u201cRight, right,\u201d Xie Lian said hurriedly, scrambling up. He gave a few flustered steps past Hua Cheng\u2014\n\u201cYour Highness.\u201d\n\u201cWh-what?\u201d\nThe amusement in Hua Cheng\u2019s voice turned almost elated. \u201cThe bed is over there. You\u2019re going the wrong way.\u201d\nXie Lian blinked, looking around. \u201cAh\u2014right, right.\u201d He hurried over, then stood next to the bed. What had Hua Cheng said to do next?\nAs it turned out, it didn\u2019t matter. Xie Lian heard the steady clink of Hua Cheng coming up behind him, then two steady hands pushing his shoulders down.\n\u201cKneel,\u201d said Hua Cheng. \u201cRemember?\u201d\nOn wobbly legs, Xie Lian was pressed down to his knees. They hit the floor with a dull thump.\n\u201cStay just like this,\u201d Hua Cheng said, and walked off.\nNot knowing whether to laugh or to cry, Xie Lian laid his hands on his knees and waited. He could hear Hua Cheng doing something behind him, and wondered whether he should look. Just as he was turning, however\u2014\nA hand came down on his head and firmly turned it back the other way. \u201cI said, stay.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t say I couldn\u2019t look\u2026\u201d\n\u201cGive me your hands.\u201d\n\u201cMy hands?\u201d Xie Lian glanced down at his hands, then over his shoulder. \u201cHow should I\u2014\u201d\nHua Cheng took hold of Xie Lian\u2019s wrists, then pulled them behind his back. Something was wrapped around them tightly. Then, a knot was pulled snug.\nThey\u2019d been bound together.\n\u201cMy lord?\u201d Xie Lian said, very softly.\nClink-clink, clink-clink went Hua Cheng\u2019s boots, as he came around Xie Lian. After he\u2019d circled once, satisfied, he sat on the bed and leaned forward. His eye was dark.\nXie Lian stared up, speechless; being tied like this on his knees on the floor was an odd feeling. Without being able to move his arms or use his legs, it was like all his energy was pooling somewhere else, low in his stomach\u2014burning and aching softly.\n\u201cDo you know what I\u2019m going to do with you?\u201d\nRed-faced, Xie Lian glanced up. \u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s hard to guess\u2026\u201d\n\u201cGuess.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to recite the ethics sutra with mmph\u2014!\u201d\nHua Cheng had taken the back of Xie Lian\u2019s head, shoving his face against into his groin. Though he was still clothed, the outline of his cock was hot and hard through the layers.\nXie Lian\u2019s face was pressed in harder and harder by Hua Cheng\u2019s hand, then crushed on both sides by powerful thighs, until he could barely breathe. He gave a muffled plea against the fabric.\n\u201cIf you try to be funny again, I\u2019ll smother you like this,\u201d Hua Cheng said. \u201cUnderstood?\u201d\nWith some effort, Xie Lian nodded.\nPleased, Hua Cheng let go.\nA heavy haze was coming over Xie Lian\u2019s mind. Even when he got air again, he was panting. Without thinking much, he pressed a soft kiss to the straining outline of Hua Cheng\u2019s cock before leaning back.\n\u201cGood,\u201d Hua Cheng breathed. \u201cYou learn quickly. Give my boot a kiss, too.\u201d\nXie Lian thought for a moment about refusing. After all, if Hua Cheng got his memories back and remembered this, it wouldn\u2019t be good.\nAnd yet\u2026\nSorry, San Lang, you can blame me for this later. As if he\u2019d never had the thought, Xie Lian bent over, careful not to lose his balance with his hands tied, and kissed the leather of Hua Cheng\u2019s boot. A silver chain was cool against his lips; he lapped it into his mouth and sucked for a second before drawing back again, letting it fall away. A string of saliva remained, connecting his tongue to the metal.\nWhen he looked up again, Hua Cheng\u2019s lips were parted slightly, and his pupil was blown as he stared. \u201c\u2026\u201d\nSuddenly regaining his senses, Xie Lian snapped out of it and smoldered with embarrassment. He turned his head, clumsily wiping his chin on his shoulder, but Hua Cheng took it and turned it back.\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t lying,\u201d he mused. \u201cYou\u2019ve done this before.\u201d\nXie Lian nodded.\n\u201cWith who?\u201d The grip on his chin tightened. \u201cWas it the person you\u2019re waiting to be reunited with?\u201d\nFinding this a bit pathetic, Xie Lian sighed. San Lang, getting jealous of yourself\u2014isn\u2019t this like a dog attacking its own reflection?\nTaking his silence as a refusal to answer, Hua Cheng\u2019s eye narrowed. He didn\u2019t say anything, though, just let go and started pulling off his boots.\nDeep breaths, deep breaths\u2014Xie Lian closed his eyes and tried to control his feelings, as boots were laid aside and fabric rustled in front of him. He really had done this lots of times, but it had been different with Hua Cheng in the past; he\u2019d started off by instructing Xie Lian gently, keeping a friendly tone and making jokes as he showed where to lick and touch.\nThinking about it, Xie Lian smiled with his eyes closed.\n\u201cIs something funny?\u201d\nWith a jolt, Xie Lian opened his eyes just in time to see Hua Cheng take himself out of his clothing.\nHua Cheng\u2019s cock hung out in front of him, swollen and red, veins standing out, barely a breath away from Xie Lian\u2019s face. It was a familiar sight, but Xie Lian still stared.\nWith a soft sigh, Hua Cheng started stroking himself, never moving his gaze from Xie Lian\u2019s lips. With a languid squeeze he pulled back his foreskin, letting it roll down from the head; the precum that had pooled there slowly oozed out.\nIt wasn\u2019t an unfamiliar sight, but this kind of presentation brought on a dull throbbing in Xie Lian\u2019s\u2026\nNever mind that. There was a job to do and memories to restore; Xie Lian had to stay focused. He leaned forward and laid the softest kiss against the leaking tip.\nHua Cheng let out a harsh breath, and the muscles of his abdomen twitched. He squeezed his cock in his hand and pushed the tip against Xie Lian\u2019s lips, letting it catch and rub against the plush surface. Breathing heavier, he milked out his precum and rubbed it in, until it trickled down Xie Lian\u2019s chin.\nThough a little shy, Xie Lian licked it off, tasting salt.\nHua Cheng twitched in his seated position, like the muscles of his hips were begging to move. Instead, he pulled Xie Lian\u2019s face closer and rubbed his cock against his cheek.\nSomeone\u2019s excited, Xie Lian thought, closing one eye as the hot and heavy length tugged his cheek back and forth. \u201cMy lord,\u201d he said finally. \u201cCan I suggest something?\u201d\n\u201cMn.\u201d\n\u201cCan you untie my arms? I can work with my hands, too.\u201d\nHua Cheng seemed unmoved, switching his cock to Xie Lian\u2019s other cheek and continuing to rub against the flushed skin. \u201cIf you work with your hands, you won\u2019t work with your tongue.\u201d\nXie Lian stared up earnestly. \u201cI will. You can tie me right back up if you don\u2019t like it.\u201d\nAt those words, Hua Cheng\u2019s face twitched into a grimace, and he squeezed his cock in his fist. Xie Lian felt it throb against his cheek; soon, a trickle of fresh precum oozed down, leaking past his jaw.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nAfter a moment\u2019s consideration, leaning over, Hua Cheng took the edge of the ribbon binding Xie Lian\u2019s arms and pulled the knot free.\n\u201cThank you, my lord,\u201d Xie Lian said with a smile. He\u2019d won the battle now, but he needed to stay free to perform at his best. In order to keep his hands untied, he\u2019d need to be convincing. Reaching up with his now-freed hand, he swiped a finger through the smear of cum on his cheek and put it in his mouth, sucking it clean.\n\u201cGood,\u201d Hua Cheng breathed.\nFeeling encouraged, Xie Lian leaned forward. This was going his way. Surely, if he did a good job at this, Hua Cheng would give him a kiss soon?\nBut it only took one second, and the feeling of Xie Lian wrapping his delicate, sticky fingers around the red-hot base of his cock, for Hua Cheng to grab his wrists and wrench them apart.\n\u201cI changed my mind,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to put it down your throat.\u201d\nBewildered, Xie Lian lost his cool demeanor. \u201cBut I\u2014I did everything you said?\u201d\n\u201cLie down.\u201d\nWas it that bad? Just from one touch, was it that bad?!\nAll those times before, when he\u2019d done it with Hua Cheng\u2014were his skills really, truly so terrible that they could barely be tolerated?\nFeeling weak, Xie Lian stopped fighting. Letting his arms go limp, he allowed himself to be placed down on the rug face-up.\nHua Cheng sank to his knees at Xie Lian\u2019s head, taking it between his hands, but paused. \u201cWhat\u2019s with that look.\u201d\nXie Lian was glum. \u201cWhat look?\u201d\n\u201cThe one on your face.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t lie.\u201d\n\u201cI said, it\u2019s nothing!\u201d Xie Lian said, exasperated. \u201cI can\u2019t cook, I can\u2019t do anything, I can\u2019t even do this right, so whatever.\u201d\nA finger stroked his cheek. \u201cIf you do a good job here, I\u2019ll let you kneel again.\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. If I\u2019m only good to be a hole, then I\u2019ll be a hole. It doesn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u201cShhhh,\u201d Hua Cheng coaxed, then giving a quiet laugh. \u201cDon\u2019t be stubborn. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong; I\u2019m the one who\u2019s impatient. Be obedient, kiss where I show you, and I\u2019ll let you up again.\u201d\nXie Lian tried to grasp the meaning; did he mean that Xie Lian was so good at it that Hua Cheng had gotten too riled up? Somehow, he doubted it. But what else could he mean?\nIn any case, this gentle voice seemed so much like his San Lang\u2026\nHua Cheng tapped his cheek. \u201cWell?\u201d\n\u201cEn,\u201d Xie Lian said softly.\n\u201cGood,\u201d Hua Cheng murmured. He ran a thumb through the precum on Xie Lian\u2019s chin, then tucked it in his mouth. Xie Lian sucked without thinking. \u201cDon\u2019t think. Just do what I say.\u201d\nXie Lian nodded again, closing his eyes. It was easier not to think.\nThen the thumb was gone, and something soft and hot was being lowered onto Xie Lian\u2019s mouth.\nIn a daze, Xie Lian opened his eyes. He couldn\u2019t see much, but he knew what was on his face, and he knew what Hua Cheng wanted.\n\u00a0Closing his eyes again, he gave Hua Cheng\u2019s balls a few kisses. They were heavier than expected, nearly smothering his nose and mouth, but they didn\u2019t just hold still; Xie Lian could feel them twitching. Encouraged, Xie Lian nudged up into them and kissed a little more.\nIn response, Hua Cheng pressed down more, giving gentle rubs of the soft skin over his mouth. Tilting his head up, Xie Lian mouthed at it and sucked.\n\u201cSee, Your Highness?\u201d Hua Cheng\u2019s voice was low and coaxing. \u201cIt comes naturally to you. You were made for this.\u201d\nA plaintive sound came from the back of Xie Lian\u2019s throat. His own cock, which had started to ache, gave a throb; he soothed himself through it by sucking more pointedly.\nAt that, the thighs around Xie Lian\u2019s head tensed, and suddenly Hua Cheng was moving away. Xie Lian kept suckling at the delicate skin of Hua Cheng\u2019s balls until they came away with a soft click.\nThen he was free again, and he was being gently helped back up to his knees. \u201cGood job, Your Highness,\u201d Hua Cheng praised. \u201cYou did well.\u201d\nXie Lian could only nod. He was deeply, deeply under, lost in the fog of his own arousal; he could hardly remember why he was doing any of this in the first place, or whose memories were lost, or much of anything else. All he knew is that he\u2019d done a good job, and Hua Cheng was praising him for it. It had been so many days since he\u2019d heard praise in this voice. He was so hungry for it\u2014he hadn\u2019t realized how much he needed it.\nWith a careful touch, Hua Cheng peeled Xie Lian\u2019s robes off his shoulders, letting an alluring hint of his skin show. Satisfied, he settled on the bed. \u201cNow you can use your hands.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, my lord,\u201d Xie Lian said, and reached forward.\nThe next few minutes were all a blur. Xie Lian let his memory take over his movements; his hands stroked and stroked, milking Hua Cheng\u2019s cock into his mouth, following the familiar patterns that he knew brought Hua Cheng to the edge.\nAbove him, Hua Cheng\u2019s breathing got heavier and heavier. Not only that, his thighs quivered.\nIt quickly became obvious, Xie Lian realized as his mind cleared, that this Hua Cheng had all the same sensitive spots as he had before. The delicate place to be licked just beneath the head, the space behind the balls which Xie Lian massaged with his fingers, the vein on the side where Xie Lian rolled his thumb\u2014all of these reliably made Hua Cheng squirm. Feeling encouraged, Xie Lian pressed on.\nHe\u2019d been right. It was the same. Hua Cheng\u2019s state got more and more pitiful. His thighs weren\u2019t just quivering in intervals now, they were shaking without pause; his stomach was rising and falling, then clenching so hard that it seemed to hurt. Voiced, harsh panting came from above, carrying hints of desperation, and he stared down at Xie Lian with something like confused disbelief. It was obvious that he hadn\u2019t expected this. \u201cYour Highness,\u201d he breathed. \u201cYour Highe\u2014Your Highness\u2014\u201d\nIt was getting to the point where Xie Lian felt bad for him. Hua Cheng was always so vulnerable when he came. Letting go of his cock, Xie Lian felt up for Hua Cheng\u2019s pale hands, and found them waiting, trembling. Clasping them together, intertwining his steady fingers with Hua Cheng\u2019s clammy ones, he sank his mouth down and gave it his all.\nSan Lang, Xie Lian called out in his head, and swallowed around Hua Cheng\u2019s cock.\nWhether it was the wet squeeze of Xie Lian\u2019s throat or the warm press of his hands, that was all it took to send Hua Cheng over the edge. With a choked-off cry and a spasm that Xie Lian felt vibrating through his whole body, Hua Cheng came.\nThe whole time, while he swallowed down what came out, Xie Lian held Hua Cheng\u2019s hands. There was so much of it\u2014every time Xie Lian thought it was over, Hua Cheng\u2019s breath caught and strained, his stomach tightened, his cock throbbed\u2014and yet another spurt of hot cum was pumped into Xie Lian\u2019s mouth, where it was dutifully helped down his throat.\nOnce it was finally over, Xie Lian pulled his mouth off and looked up.\nFrom his head down to his shoulders, Hua Cheng\u2019s skin was flushed deep red, and it seemed shiny. His gaze was hazy. Actually, if Xie Lian didn\u2019t know any better, it almost seemed like\u2014\n\u201cSa\u2014my lord? Don\u2019t faint, it\u2019s okay. Let me help you.\u201d He tried to pull his hands away, but Hua Cheng had them in a sweat-soaked death grip. \u201cMy lord?\u201d Awkwardly trying to stand with his hands trapped, he sighed. \u201cMy\u2014\u201d\nHua Cheng suddenly pressed his hands in a bone-crushing squeeze.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Xie Lian stammered, quickly getting back down to his knees. \u201cI forgot I wasn\u2019t supposed to move. Sorry\u2014\u201d\nAbruptly, Hua Cheng let go of his hands, but gripped his arms instead. \u201cDon\u2019t kneel again,\u201d he panted. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026what should I do?\u201d\n\u201cStand up.\u201d\nXie Lian got to his feet. Since Hua Cheng was still sitting on the bed, Xie Lian loomed over him. What\u2019s more, the white inner robes Xie Lian had been wearing, which had been peeled back by Hua Cheng earlier, had sunk all the way down to his waist. The pearly skin of Xie Lian\u2019s shoulders and his chest gleamed in the candlelight.\nReaching up, Hua Cheng took Xie Lian\u2019s waist in his hand and leaned his forehead against the smooth stomach in front of him, breathing hard. He was still quivering.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Xie Lian whispered. He stepped forward, cradling Hua Cheng\u2019s head against him, and ran his fingers through long black hair. \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d\nAlmost inaudibly, Hua Cheng spoke against his skin, seeming weary and lost:\n\u201cWhat are you?\u201d\nXie Lian thought this was a little funny. \u201cWhat do you mean, what am I? I\u2019m a god.\u201d\n\u201cA god,\u201d Hua Cheng said slowly, working around it\u2014as though for the first time, he was understanding what the word really meant.\nAfter a moment of contemplation, pressing Xie Lian\u2019s waist between his hands, he kissed the skin of his stomach right above his navel.\nHe\u2019s kissing me, Xie Lian realized with a jolt. It was only a matter of getting him up to his lips. It was fine, though; he\u2019d be patient for now. Memories or not, Hua Cheng was in a vulnerable state.\n\u201cDid you swallow?\u201d Hua Cheng whispered. \u201cI didn\u2019t see.\u201d\n\u201cEn.\u201d Xie Lian stroked Hua Cheng\u2019s head, then pressed it against his stomach. \u201cPart of you is in here now. That\u2019s what it means to give an offering to a god.\u201d\n\u201cMn,\u201d Hua Cheng acknowledged, before kissing the same place again.\nSeeing this kind of familiar worship, Xie Lian felt a twinge on the inside. The feeling pooled in his groin, making everything tight and hot.\nSomething else distracting was happening, though. Hua Cheng had picked something up off the ground and stood up, walking around him.\n\u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d Xie Lian stopped in disbelief. \u201c\u2026you\u2019re tying my hands again?\u201d\n\u00a0Hua Cheng pulled the knot snug. \u201cMn.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Your Highness,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI\u2019m just going to give another offering. Let me guide you.\u201d\nHe couldn\u2019t possibly mean he wanted Xie Lian to swallow more, did he? Surely even a ghost king couldn\u2019t recover that fast. Xie Lian tried to look over his shoulder in question, but Hua Cheng was moving him, guiding him to sit on the bed. With some help, Xie Lian was leaned against the pillows.\nDespite having his arms tied behind his back, Xie Lian found this pretty comfortable. The gentleness of Hua Cheng\u2019s movements lulled him, too. After only a second, his eyelids were lowering.\n\u201cOh?\u201d Hua Cheng smoothed a few hairs back from Xie Lian\u2019s face. \u201cIs His Highness drowsy after his meal?\u201d\nXie Lian\u2019s eyes snapped open. Now he\u2019d really done it, he was falling asleep during sex. \u201cNo no, it\u2019s fine,\u201d he said quickly. \u201cI can\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Hua Cheng reached down with a smile, rubbing Xie Lian\u2019s stomach. \u201cIt\u2019s good to rest, it helps with digestion.\u201d\nThe vulgar edge to the words made Xie Lian blush, but the rubbing made him comfortable, so he nodded and nestled in against the pillows.\n\u201cYou\u2019re so\u2026\u201d Hua Cheng\u2019s breath shuddered. Clearly, the sight of Xie Lian dozing off with a stomach full of hot cum was going to his head. Reaching out slowly, he took hold of Xie Lian\u2019s hair ribbon and pulled until it fluttered free.\nXie Lian\u2019s hair spilled out, framing his shoulders. He opened his eyes a little, watching Hua Cheng\u2019s sharp, devouring expression. Judging from that look, he was probably getting hard again\u2026\nSo why hadn \u2019t he kissed him yet?!\nIt was to be expected, right?! Hua Cheng had always told him that it was good etiquette to kiss a lover after they\u2019ve serviced you\u2014unless maybe that was just another tactic from Hua Cheng to get more kisses.\nJust as he had that thought, Hua Cheng leaned forward and pecked his forehead with utmost care. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do anything,\u201d he murmured. \u201cJust lie back.\u201d\nExactly, Xie Lian thought. You\u2019re the one who has to do something. Flushed with hope, he lifted his chin.\nHua Cheng\u2019s hand slipped down to his cheek. His thumb ran over Xie Lian\u2019s lower lip.\nXie Lian waited, his heart pounding.\nBut a complicated look crossed Hua Cheng\u2019s face, and he hesitated. Then\u2014\nHe kissed Xie Lian\u2019s chin, before continuing further down.\nOpening his eyes, Xie Lian gave a look of bewilderment. San Lang, when you forgot me, did you forget about the concept of kisses on the mouth, too?! There was no way, it was impossible to miss, unless\u2014\nHe didn\u2019t want to.\nAnd if Hua Cheng didn\u2019t want to, no matter how much Xie Lian begged\u2014even if Hua Cheng gave the kiss out of pity\u2014it wouldn\u2019t work.\nXie Lian couldn\u2019t help it; he teared up a little, his mind going to the worst possibilities even as Hua Cheng pressed kisses into his jaw. Was this what he was? An annoying, clumsy, unkissable plaything?\nThen why would Hua Cheng be kissing everywhere else on his body???\nTurning his head, he tried to meet Hua Cheng\u2019s gaze. \u201cMy lord?\u201d\nWhen Hua Cheng looked up, his movements were slow and syrupy, like he\u2019d just come out of a trance.\nMaybe Hua Cheng just needed encouragement; Xie Lian could kiss him first. \u201cCan I\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even say what\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAre you going to ask to do something for me?\u201d\nXie Lian closed his mouth, not daring to answer.\n\u201cIf you try asking again, I\u2019ll gag you.\u201d\nXie Lian nodded.\nOne hand crept down, parting Xie Lian\u2019s robes as it went. \u201cYou\u2019re a god,\u201d Hua Cheng said, his eye burning. \u201cTake your offerings.\u201d\n\u201cEn, en,\u201d Xie Lian said. He was feeling a little dazed by that sentence. Maybe it was best to just let things take their course after all. \u201cWhat does my lord want to give me?\u201d\nHua Cheng pressed a deep kiss into Xie Lian\u2019s neck, reached down, and gave his groin a squeeze.\nXie Lian jerked in place, straining against his bonds. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2014!\u201d\nThat same skilled hand kneaded at his crotch, then crept inside his robes to pull his cock free. Xie Lian felt dizzy. Oh, he was about to\u2014he was about to get\u2014\nHua Cheng stopped kissing his neck to look down. A smile crossed his face. \u201cStill asking to serve me when you\u2019re like this, Your Highness?\u201d\nAs silly as he knew it was, Xie Lian squeezed his eyes shut and turned his head away. Seeing his own swollen, blushing cock, the head plump and already shiny with precum, was one thing, but knowing that this was Hua Cheng\u2019s first time seeing it too, it really\u2014\n\u201cIs it embarrassing?\u201d Hua Cheng laughed in his ear.\n\u201cIt is when you stare at it like that\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Your Highness.\u201d\nXie Lian\u2019s eyes fluttered open, at that. He looked up, his brow furrowed in question.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t take it out just to stare,\u201d Hua Cheng finished with a grin, then wrapped his hand around Xie Lian\u2019s cock and pressed hard.\n\u201cAh\u2014!\u201d Xie Lian jumped, his thighs tightening. \u201cWait wait wait, not so fast\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNot so fast?\u201d Hua Cheng mused. \u201cFine. If that\u2019s what His Highness wants.\u201d\nXie Lian knew instantly that he\u2019d made a terrible mistake, but it didn\u2019t sink in until Hua Cheng started moving his hand.\nSlowly.\nVery slowly.\nXie Lian made a soft complaint in the back of his throat. He couldn\u2019t help it. Hua Cheng\u2019s hand, now slick with precum, stroked the head of Xie Lian\u2019s cock, the touch so gentle that it almost burned. Xie Lian winced.\n\u201cO-ow\u2026\u201d\nContinuing at that torturous pace, Hua Cheng stared at Xie Lian\u2019s face, swallowing every expression. \u201cDoes it hurt? Should I make it feel better?\u201d\nXie Lian nodded quickly.\n\u201cOh.\u201d\n\nWHAT DO YOU MEAN, OH?\n\n\u201cCan you go a little fah\u2014faster\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cYou know why\u2026\u201d\nAs if he hadn\u2019t heard anything, Hua Cheng kept up the same punishingly slow pace, up and down, up and down\u2014staring at Xie Lian\u2019s face with something like obsession all the while.\n\u201cIt really hurts\u2026\u201d Xie Lian said quietly. His legs had started to tremble.\nHua Cheng wrapped his free arm around Xie Lian\u2019s waist, then leaned in and kissed his collarbone. \u201cBetter?\u201d\nIn Xie Lian\u2019s sensitive state, the kiss felt like getting eaten alive, like helplessness and dread all mixed together. He shook his head wildly.\n\u201cNo?\u201d Hua Cheng laughed. The pace of his hand didn\u2019t change, but he laid a wet kiss to Xie Lian\u2019s ear. \u201cWhat about now?\u201d\nA spasm went through Xie Lian\u2019s stomach. He held his breath and strained, trying to come, but of course he couldn\u2019t; he could only force precum to leak helplessly. The fruitless effort made him let out a burst of held breath, before starting to pant.\n\u201cShhh, shhh. You\u2019ll come, Your Highness, just relax.\u201d Hua Cheng tucked into Xie Lian\u2019s neck, humming and kissing, until Xie Lian could almost feel him in his throat.\nXie Lian\u2019s thighs quivered with the next bout of shivering. It lasted so long that he thought he\u2019d be sick; but he knew that the feeling of him shaking would only make Hua Cheng more excited, and he was right. Deadly fingers found one nipple, stroking languidly, as Hua Cheng\u2019s stare turned even more intense.\nThe intensity of the stare did nothing for the pace of his hand, though. Xie Lian could only stare down, tears in his eyes, as his poor, desperately swollen cock was handled with such cruel restraint.\nHua Cheng sighed, switching his grip and giving one long stroke up, bringing out a dribble of precum. It beaded at the tip, then leaked uselessly down Hua Cheng\u2019s fingers.\n\u201cU-ugh\u2026\u201d Xie Lian whimpered.\nHua Cheng smiled, resuming his tortuously slow pace. \u201cYour Highness, you\u2019re really amazing. You vibrate and make music; you\u2019re like a guqin.\u201d\n\u201cThen pl\u2014ah!\u201d\nOne curious hand had slipped down to his rear, giving a squeeze. \u201cOr maybe a pipa.\u201d\n\u201cThen play faster\u2014f\u2014FUCK!\u201d Xie Lian sobbed.\nChuckling at the swear, Hua Cheng nuzzled him. \u201cWhy would I play faster? This is mellow music, to please gods.\u201d\nXie Lian shook his head. \u201cL-liar\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t lie, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201cFine! Then I\u2019m not a god, I don\u2019t like that kind of music!\u201d Xie Lian cried out, feeling stupid. \u201cI\u2019m a scrap-collector, just a simple scrap collector!\u201d\nHua Cheng burst out laughing.\nAbout to give up on coming forever, Xie Lian made a despairing face\u2014when all of a sudden, Hua Cheng\u2019s hand suddenly stopped. His thumb pressed down onto the swollen hole at the tip of Xie Lian\u2019s cock.\n\u201cOkay, Your Highness. Are you listening?\u201d\nDetermined not to be bullied again, Xie Lian closed his eyes and didn\u2019t answer.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to finish for me now.\u201d\nXie Lian opened his eyes. \u201cWhat\u2014\u201d\nThen his cock was being gripped tight by two slick hands\u2014massaging top to bottom, kneading so hard and steady that they would\u2019ve made quick work of a pile of dough.\n\u201cAren\u2019t you a god?\u201d Hua Cheng breathed in his ear. \u201cBeautiful god. Come.\u201d\nAll words were lost. Xie Lian choked, then saw stars, then came so hard that he blacked out.\n\u00a0\n\ud83e\udd6e\n\u00a0\nWhen Xie Lian opened his eyes, he was being carefully cleaned off with a towel, lying in bed.\nHis mind was blank. Where was he? What was happening?\n\u201cHold still,\u201d said a gentle voice.\nHearing that familiar sound, Xie Lian smiled, knowing where he was and who he was with\u2014loving, safe. He reached out for it, wrapping the source in an embrace and pulling him down. So warm, so good.\nThe person who he was embracing let himself be pulled, jerky in his movements, as if he was unfamiliar with it. Xie Lian thought this was silly. Didn\u2019t they hug in bed like this all the time?\nAt last, though, the person, his pretty ghost, let himself be pulled down. Xie Lian draped himself over him, then pressed his head against his chest and smiled.\n\u201cLove you, San Lang,\u201d he mumbled.\nHua Cheng went rigid.\nXie Lian\u2019s eyes snapped open.\n\nFUCK!!!!! HE'D \nFUCKED UP!!!!!!!!\n\nIn the words of an old former friend, he\u2019d called the wrong person. There were only two options now.\nOne, tell Hua Cheng that \u201cSan Lang\u201d was the one he was waiting for. If he did that, Hua Cheng would never kiss him.\nTwo, tell Hua Cheng that they\u2019d been married and he\u2019d lost his memories, a story anyone would be insane to believe. If he did that, Hua Cheng would never kiss him, either.\nHua Cheng would never kiss him.\nHua Cheng would never get his memories back.\nIn a panic, Xie Lian sat up. He had to think. He had to get air and think. One quick glance at Hua Cheng in bed beside him to see if maybe it was fine\u2014\nHua Cheng was wearing a devastated expression.\n\u201cHave to get some air,\u201d Xie Lian mumbled, snatched up his robes, tied his belt quickly, charged out the door and down the hall and out into the walled courtyard outside.\n\u00a0\n\ud83e\udd6e\n\u00a0\nIt was raining a little bit.\nThe rain wasn\u2019t enough to be a downpour, just enough to make the grass in the courtyard slippery. It was therefore no surprise when Xie Lian slipped.\n\nSPLASH!\n\nLuckily, he hadn\u2019t pitched into the small decorative pond; he\u2019d just fallen to his hands and knees in front of it. Rather, the splash had come from\u2026\nRubbing rain out of his eyes, Xie Lian looked to the side and saw a bucket turned over. He\u2019d knocked over the lotus they\u2019d planted.\nXie Lian\u2019s eyes filled with tears.\nStill, he scrambled over and righted it. The tuber had been knocked askew, half the water spilled. Thoughtlessly, he pressed it back down in place, then cupped his hands and started scooping water up from the pond. Little by little, he started filling up the bucket again.\nSuddenly, though, he realized something. Before, the water in the bucket had been chaotic, rippling with raindrops from above. Now, though, it was peaceful and still.\nXie Lian paused, then looked up.\nHua Cheng was standing over him, holding an umbrella over his head.\nBut Hua Cheng\u2019s expression wasn\u2019t stormy; there was only a tender sadness, and he spoke gently:\n\u201cWho\u2019s San Lang?\u201d\nWith his hands covered in mud, Xie Lian stared up. He couldn\u2019t speak; he was afraid he\u2019d burst into tears.\n\u201cIs he the one you want to be reunited with?\u201d\nAfter a moment\u2019s hesitation, Xie Lian gave up. He nodded.\nSlowly, Hua Cheng sank down. The edges of his robes were getting stained, but it didn\u2019t seem to bother him. His gaze was fixed on Xie Lian. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say anything?\u201d\nXie Lian\u2019s lips wobbled, but he restrained himself. \u201cBecause it\u2019s impossible.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s impossible?\u201d\nXie Lian couldn\u2019t look at him, shaking his head. He didn\u2019t know what to say anymore. \u201cBecause we can\u2019t be together again. It\u2019s impossible.\u201d\nFor a long moment, Hua Cheng pondered. There was a conflicted look in his eye, but he seemed to suppress it and asked quietly: \u201cWhy not?\u201d\nAt that, finally, it was impossible to hold back. Tears rolled down Xie Lian\u2019s cheeks, and his voice thickened.\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m not good enough to get him back,\u201d Xie Lian wept, wiping his sleeve across his eyes. \u201cI got him once since I got lucky, but I lost him, and now I can\u2019t ever get him back. I wasn\u2019t good enough to get him in the first place, it was all luck all along.\u201d\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t good enough?\u201d Hua Cheng murmured, somewhere between pity and amusement. \u201cYour Highness, how aren\u2019t you good enough?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just not,\u201d Xie Lian said, wiping away frustrated tears. \u201cI\u2019m not smart enough, or appealing enough, or skilled enough, or\u2014or anything at all. I can do a few things, but I mostly just got lucky. Why would I deserve someone so good, that kind of devotion? Anyone could\u2019ve done what I did for him, I just got lucky that one time.\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019ll give up on this person?\u201d\nXie Lian messily wiped at his face, choking back a sob. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s not giving up, it\u2019s setting him free. Don\u2019t you get it?\u201d\nThere was a long silence, punctuated by the patter of the rain on the umbrella. Hua Cheng seemed to be thinking to himself. There was a slump in his shoulders, like he was shouldering some terrible hurt; but his eye still shone, and he smiled sadly.\n\u201cYour Highness,\u201d he said finally, with so much gentleness in his voice that it twisted the heart to hear. \u201cI know I\u2019ve been a bit callous towards you. Still, I hope that you\u2019ll hear what I have to say.\u201d\nEmbarrassed at his outburst, Xie Lian nodded without a word.\n\u201cOf course you\u2019re good enough,\u201d Hua Cheng went on, meeting his gaze. \u201cYou\u2019re more than good enough. You\u2019re smart, you\u2019re resourceful, you\u2019re kind. You don\u2019t give up easily. Your insight is sharp, but not enough to make you cold. You\u2019re warm to be around. It\u2019s easy to like you.\u201d He seemed to struggle with something, but kept his voice steady. \u201cBetter stated, it\u2019s impossible not to. Actually, I\u2026\u201d\nHis voice lowered, and his grip tightened on the handle of the umbrella.\n\u201cI\u2019m only saying like because I don\u2019t dare to say more.\u201d\nAt that, Xie Lian looked up in surprise. \u201cYou\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Hua Cheng interrupted, putting a finger to his lips. Even that movement seemed to pain him, like it was the last thing he wanted to do. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t say that to add to your troubles. If you have something to say to your important person, don\u2019t waste it on me.\u201d\nXie Lian blinked at him, startled. When the hand had been moved away, he spoke slowly. \u201cThen why didn\u2019t you\u2026\u201d\n\u201cKiss you?\u201d\nXie Lian went weak, trembling. He knew that what he heard next would tell him his fate, and he was scared; but what he heard made his chest tighten with another feeling entirely.\n\u201cBecause you\u2019d said you had someone else,\u201d Hua Cheng finished. \u201cI know you wanted it, but I didn\u2019t want to take advantage. Really, I think\u2026\u201d\nThe next words seemed to be choked out of an unwilling throat, but they came:\n\u201cYour Highness, if you love someone so much, it must be the purest love in the whole world. I\u2019d never take something so precious from someone\u2014\u201c He stopped and laughed to himself. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not right. I\u2019d take precious things from anyone, just never from you. See what you\u2019ve done to me, Your Highness?\u201d His voice became unsteady with a hint of tears, and the umbrella in his hand trembled. \u201cJust after a few short days?\u201d\nXie Lian was too stunned to speak, so Hua Cheng just kept on going:\n\u201cYou can\u2019t give up on the person you love. You have to reunite with him again; I can see you won\u2019t be happy until you do. And you have to be happy, or else\u2014or else\u2014\u201c The umbrella started trembling so violently that he had to add another hand to steady it, and he laughed helplessly. \u201cCan you tell I want to kill myself for saying this? Still, I can\u2019t keep you trapped. I want to, though. I want to stuff you in a birdcage and keep you to myself forever. I\u2019ve gone crazy. You should really run before I change my mind, Your Highness, there\u2019s something wrong with me\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Xie Lian burst out suddenly. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t give up. I won\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026good,\u201d Hua Cheng breathed, though his shoulders trembled. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you would.\u201d\n\u201cYou asked who San Lang is.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s a\u2026\u201d Hua Cheng was trembling with desperation. \u201cA very lucky\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s you.\u201d\nDead silence. Raindrops drumming on the roof of a red umbrella.\nHua Cheng stared, dumbfounded, and opened his mouth to speak\u2014but once Xie Lian got started, he couldn\u2019t stop, rambling like crazy.\n\u201cIt\u2019s you, it\u2019s you, of course it\u2019s you! It\u2019s always been you,\u201d he blurted out. \u201cI know it won\u2019t make sense, I\u2019ll sound like I\u2019ve gone stupid, but actually, you lost your memories because of a curse, so you don\u2019t remember me at all. Also, nobody around you remembers me, because of the curse\u2014I know it sounds like I\u2019ve gone crazy\u2014also, if there\u2019s anything around you that\u2019s related to me, it\u2019ll look different, and\u2014\u201d\nRealizing how ridiculous it sounded, Xie Lian couldn\u2019t help but tear up in frustration. Facing Hua Cheng\u2019s shocked expression, he went on:\n\u201cAnd we weren\u2019t just together, we got married!\u201d On that word, the tears overflowed. \u201cYou promised never to leave me, and we knew each other for hundreds of years, and you gave me your ashes, I just didn\u2019t bring them because I thought you\u2019d kill me if I\u2014\u201d\nAt that, Hua Cheng, who\u2019d just been staring straight ahead, tried to speak. \u201cWait, wait, go back,\u201d he fumbled out. \"I\u2014I\u2019m married? To you?\u201d\nSee?\u201d Xie Lian blubbered. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014hic\u2014different when you\u2019re the one who\u2019d actually get stuck with me, right? With my terrible cooking, and my lecturing, and my\u2014\u201d\n\u201cW-w-wait a second.\u201d Hua Cheng looked like he\u2019d just had a plate shattered over his head. \u201cMarried as in\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMarried as in married, what else is there?\u201d Xie Lian sobbed. \u201cWe spent so much time together, eating together, answering prayers together, fixing up my shrine together, having fun in ghost city, everything. We\u2019ve slept in that bed together more times than I can count, and we spent all the important festivals together in the market, eating weird candy, only you would always tell me which ones I shouldn\u2019t eat\u2014\u201d\nHua Cheng looked like he\u2019d just had three plates shattered over his head before getting hit by a hammer. \u201cI got to do all that with you? Together?\u201d\n\u201cWe were even planning to see the ghost city fireworks tonight, at the mid-autumn festival.\u201d Xie Lian sniffled, rubbing his eyes with his sleeve. \u201cI know it doesn\u2019t make any sense\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWait, so when you said that you\u2019d done it before, you meant\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOf course I\u2019ve done it with you, who else would I do it with? You taught me how, we\u2019ve done it so many times, in all sorts of ways, I don\u2019t know!\u201d Xie Lian had gone completely silly, saying anything that appeared in his head without thinking. \u201cForward, backward, sideways\u2014\u201d\nWith a dazed look on his face, Hua Cheng stared at him, rainwater dripping off his hair.\n\u201c\u2014but now that I spent the whole past few days being a burden, bothering you, ruining your meals, I don\u2019t know if\u2014\u201d\nAll of a sudden, there was something being crammed into Xie Lian\u2019s hand. It was the handle of the umbrella. Xie Lian took hold of it and held it upright in his shock, just in time for Hua Cheng to throw himself in a bow in front of him and shout\u2014\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d\nQuickly adjusting the umbrella, Xie Lian blinked. \u201cHuh?!\u201d\n\u201cPlease take me back,\u201d Hua Cheng begged, with his face to the ground. \u201cI\u2019ll\u2014I\u2019ll do anything. We\u2019re still married, right? I\u2019m sorry, Your Highness. I know I was rude. I just didn\u2019t know what else to do. I promise I won\u2019t be like that anymore, I\u2019ll treat you like a god, I\u2019ll do anything you want. It\u2019s okay if I can\u2019t ever get my memories of you back, we can just make new ones. Okay? We\u2019ll do all of those things together\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWait, you\u2026you believe me?\u201d Xie Lian paused, then peered down at him. \u201cSan Lang, did hit your head\u2014\u201d\nHua Cheng shook his head and straightened up, his eye soft with fondness. \u201cIt\u2019s not about believing you. It\u2019s just that if there\u2019s any chance of what you just said being true, I have to take it.\u201d\nStunned by the words, Xie Lian was speechless for a moment. \u201cYou\u2019d really want me?\u201d he whispered finally. \u201cEven without knowing why you loved me in the first place?\u201d\n\u201cI love you now. Isn\u2019t it enough?\u201d\nFor a moment, Xie Lian just looked at him. His heart felt swollen and warm.\nHua Cheng looked back and smiled, tearful.\nThen\u2014\nXie Lian crossed his arms, folding the umbrella in his elbow. His tone changed. \u201cSo you\u2019re sorry, are you?\u201d\nHua Cheng opened his mouth, then closed it. \u201cI\u2014\u201d\nReaching out, Xie Lian pinched one cheek and stretched it, scolding him sternly. \u201cYou should be sorry, I can\u2019t believe how rude you were. I\u2019m going to teach you manners; I\u2019ve been too soft for too long, this was really unacceptable. Is this really how you treat everyone who isn\u2019t me? Do you think it\u2019s okay to treat guests like that, ah?\u201d\n\u201cYour Highness,\u201d Hua Cheng pleaded, his voice muffled by the stretching. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Your Highness, I was wrong\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to find the longest hospitality manual I can, and you\u2019re going to copy it.\u201d Xie Lian stretched his cheek a little more. \u201cThree times.\u201d\nThoroughly scolded, Hua Cheng nodded obediently.\nLetting out a sigh, Xie Lian released his cheek. \u201cEven though I know you won\u2019t, once you get your memories back. I\u2019ll consider you forgiven as long as you come with me to the fireworks tonight.\u201d\nAt that, Hua Cheng\u2019s eyes widened in shock. \u201cI can get my memories back? Your Highness! You know how to break the curse?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026en.\u201d\nHua Cheng\u2019s eye shone so brightly that Xie Lian almost had to look away, and he put his hands on Xie Lian\u2019s shoulders. \u201cTell me.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u201d Xie Lian eyed him guiltily. \u201cAre you sure you want them back now, before going to the festival? We can do it after\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhy wait?\u201d\n\u201cHmmm. It\u2019s only that, once you remember everything, it might be difficult to get you to come with me\u2026you really want them back right now?\u201d\n\u201cI do,\u201d said Hua Cheng, beaming. \u201cI want to remember as soon as possible. I want to know everything about you.\u201d\nHow could Xie Lian say no to a face like that?\n\u201cAll right, but don\u2019t blame yourself,\u201d Xie Lian said. \u201cThe way you get them back is by kissing mmmmnh\u2014\u201d\nHua Cheng had thrown himself forward, meeting Xie Lian\u2019s lips with his own. The umbrella went flying.\nBy the time he was done kissing, the rain had slowed to a drizzle, then stopped.\nWith a dreamy smile still on his face, Hua Cheng eased back.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nThen, he blinked.\n.\n.\n.\n\u00a0\n\ud83e\udd6e\n\u00a0\n\u201cSan Lang. San Lang? San Lang.\u201d Xie Lian tried to walk, pulling along the dead weight on his leg. \u201cSan Lang, San Lang. Come on, we\u2019re going to miss the fireworks. San Lang.\u201d\nHua Cheng was face-down, gripping Xie Lian\u2019s ankle. His voice was muffled by the grass. \u201cJust drag me through the mud.\u201d\n\u201cSan Lang, don\u2019t be like this, your clothes are getting all dirty. We\u2019re going to the fireworks, remember? Let\u2019s get changed, quick, quick!\u201d\n\u201cGege,\u201d Hua Cheng whined.\n\u201cShhh. Don\u2019t you want moon cakes? Come on!\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly.\u201d\n\u201cDrown me in the pond.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a ghost, you can\u2019t drown\u2026ah, that reminds me.\u201d Xie Lian squatted down, lifting Hua Cheng\u2019s head up. Wiping the mud off that despondent face, he pressed his lips over and kissed, taking some spiritual energy.\n\u201cMmmn,\u201d Hua Cheng lamented into the kiss.\n\u201cStop it. Be good and stop getting your robes muddy.\u201d Letting Hua Cheng\u2019s face sink back down, Xie Lian put his fingers to his temple and spoke into the array. \u201cHey everyone, guess what? Good news! I got his memories back!\u201d\nFeng Xin\u2019s voice boomed first. \u201cGood job, Your Highness! I knew you could do it!\u201d\nMu Qing scoffed. \u201cGreat. Just please don\u2019t tell us the details.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026I wasn\u2019t going to\u2026anyway, anyway, there\u2019s just one more thing: Guoshi, can you remove the cursed shackle?\u201d\nGuoshi\u2019s voice drifted in. \u201cHuh? Shackle? Just a second, I\u2019m busy\u2026when I win I\u2019ll take it off! Just one more game, one more\u2014!\u201d\nHua Cheng reached over, clenching his hand around Xie Lian\u2019s ankle and connecting to the array. He snarled into it:\n\n\u201cWHOEVER PUT THE SHACKLE ON HIM, TAKE IT OFF.\u201d\n\nThere was silence.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nThen\u2014pop! The delicate black chain dissolved into dust and vanished.\n\u00a0\n\ud83e\udd6e\n\u00a0\n\u201cLook!\u201d Xie Lian pointed up, dangling his legs off the dock. \u201cI think that one\u2019s a dragon.\u201d\nHua Cheng was draped over him, his head leaned on his shoulder. He sighed.\n\u201cSan Lang, are you looking?\u201d\n\u201cI should be dead.\u201d\nXie Lian crammed a mooncake into Hua Cheng\u2019s mouth, then pointed up again. This time, when he spoke, it was an order. \u201cLook at the dragon.\u201d\nHua Cheng looked up.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it interesting?\u201d\n\u201cMn.\u201d\n\u201cChew.\u201d\nRaising a hand to the cake shoved in his mouth, Hua Cheng reluctantly tore off a bite and chewed.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have fun today,\u201d Xie Lian said, patting his hand.\nAt that, Hua Cheng couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cDo I have a choice?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d\n\u201cYou ordered me around for days, isn\u2019t it my turn?\u201d\nHua Cheng reached around Xie Lian\u2019s waist and squeezed, miserable. \u201cGege, I\u2019m so sorry\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine! Aiyah, you\u2019re so dramatic. It wasn\u2019t bad. It was actually cute to see you all standoffish like that.\u201d\nAt that, Hua Cheng lifted his head. \u201c\u2026\u201d He searched out Xie Lian\u2019s eyes, suspicious. \u201cOh? Did you like that?\u201d\nRealizing he\u2019d said a little too much, Xie Lian shoved a mooncake in his own mouth, stuffing his cheeks with sweet filling and crumbs.\nStill, Hua Cheng was relentless; once he\u2019d caught the hint, he went mischievous, squeezing Xie Lian tighter. \u201cSo it wasn\u2019t pretending, when gege went all tender at a little teasing?\u201d\nXie Lian mumbled through a mouthful, embarrassed. \u201cI thought you were supposed to be sorry...\u201d\nHua Cheng seemed to perk up a little. \u201cI am, but I\u2019ve also learned something new about gege.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll make you copy that scroll three times over. I mean it.\u201d\n\u201cEn, en.\u201d\nKnowing that he\u2019d opened a dangerous door, Xie Lian gave a shy glance over at Hua Cheng, then finished off his mooncake. \u201c\u2026also, I have a question.\u201d\n\u201cHm?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s about the Thousand Gold Come-And-Go Stew,\u201d Xie Lian said. He sighed. \u201cIn the future, it\u2019s best that you don\u2019t lie about liking it; there\u2019s no reason for you to choke down garbage.\u201d\n\u201cWho says I didn\u2019t like it?\u201d\n\u201cYou did, remember?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d Hua Cheng said, slotting his chin over Xie Lian\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI only told you how to make it more like what people consider 'good food,' but they\u2019re all trash. It\u2019s still my favorite dish.\u201d\n\u201cBut that first night, you clearly didn\u2019t like it\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt had a surprising feel, but I liked it. I even went back for another helping once you'd gone to sleep. Maybe the taste couldn\u2019t be considered traditional, but when I knew that it was made by your hands, I couldn\u2019t help but want more.\u201d\nTouched, Xie Lian met his eyes. \u201c\u2026you really felt like that?\u201d\n\u201cYour Highness, you could\u2019ve told me who you were by the first night,\u201d said Hua Cheng, staring off into the fireworks. \u201cI would\u2019ve done whatever you said, even then. I was terrified of what was happening to me, but I was obsessed with you.\u201d\nFeeling soft inside, Xie Lian blushed and petted his head. They both looked up at the fireworks together, hand in hand.\nXie Lian smiled.\n\u201cDoes this mean you aren\u2019t going to boil me?\u201d\n\u201cGEGE!\u201d\n.\n.\n."
