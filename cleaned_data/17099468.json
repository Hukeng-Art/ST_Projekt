    "text": "Dinner was a quiet affair. Conversation had temporarily sparked to life, before sputtering out again like a dying candle. The only sounds that came from their table were the high-pitched squeaks of cutlery against ceramic plates. Stephanie, one of the many friends Natasha had dredged up for Steve to date, sawed at her chicken with the intensity of a bone surgeon, eyebrows furrowed and lips knotted at the corners.\nSteve dropped his eyes to his own plate, resigned. Well, this was it. He was intimately familiar with that look. It was the look of someone who had signed up for Captain America and had gotten\u2014Steve.\nAs if following a script, Stephanie puffed out a sigh and deliberately set her knife and fork down.\n\u201cChicken not good?\u201d Steve asked, then winced slightly at himself. Steven Grant Rogers, stunning the ladies with his conversation skills since 1939.\nStephanie smiled at him, a tight thing that fizzled into a frown. \u201cListen, Steve\u2014\u201d\nAnd here we go. The \u2018it\u2019s not me, it\u2019s definitely you,\u2019 break up speech. At least he knew it wasn\u2019t about his looks this time. No, now it was about his personality, which was\u2014god, just so much worse.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a nice enough guy. You\u2019re just a little\u2014um.\u201d Stephanie faltered, scanning the room like it could provide her with the right adjective.\n\u201cBoring,\u201d Steve supplied.\n\u201cYes!\u201d Stephanie grimaced a little. \u201cWait, no. I mean\u2014I just thought you would be more\u2014adventurous. And, I mean, you\u2019re kind of, uh\u2014have you ever heard of Eeyore?\u201d \nSteve narrowed his eyes at her. Was she really comparing him to a depressed donkey? \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cWinnie the Pooh is that old, huh?\u201d Stephanie muttered to herself. She smiled at him, brilliant white teeth against red lips. \u201cAnyway\u2014Stephanie and Steven? That\u2019s a little too white picket fence, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\nNever again would Steve let Natasha set him up on a date. \u201cRight.\u201d\nStephanie unhooked her purse from the back of her chair and got to her feet. \u201cI\u2019ll just Venmo you for the meal, okay?\u201d\nSteve had no idea what Venmo was, but he would give his left arm if it meant getting out of this horrible date any faster. He could take care of the stupid bill. \u201cRight,\u201d he said, again.\nFor a moment, Stephanie looked like she was going to kiss his forehead\u2014and Steve would probably flip the table if she did\u2014before she smiled in a woeful sort of way and strode out of the restaurant, leaving behind the shattered remains of Steve\u2019s self-esteem and half of her chicken scarpariello.\nAnd that, as they said, was that. It wasn\u2019t like this was the first time he\u2019d been dumped for not being \u201cCaptain America\u201d enough. The problem was, everyone looked at Captain America and expected\u2014well, if Steve knew what they expected, he probably wouldn\u2019t be so boring. Did they think he would, what, whisk them off in a quinjet for a romantic getaway to Wakanda? \nWhat was wrong with wanting to have a nice quiet dinner, and then maybe to go to the pictures after if time permitted? It had been good enough back in the 30s. Why did everyone want to wander or go on adventures?\nSteve sighed and moodily finished his ribeye and mashed potatoes. Then he dragged Stephanie\u2019s plate across the table and ate her chicken, too.\nClint tossed a peanut in the air and caught it with a snap of his teeth, watching the house across the street through a pair of Stark-enhanced binoculars. As they had hoped, the tracksuited gang of unspecified Eurasian origin appeared to be meeting up for some home brew and delicious borscht. All they were missing, now, was the big boss.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Natasha said from behind him.\n\u201cYo,\u201d Clint said. He held out his bag of peanuts. \u201cPeanut?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll take one.\u201d\nClint lowered his binoculars. That\u2014hadn\u2019t been Natasha\u2019s voice. Sure enough, it was Steve Rogers digging through his bag of peanuts like he was searching for the Cracker Jack prize. \n\u201cCap! Hey, hello. Hi there.\u201d\nSteve lifted his eyebrows at Clint\u2019s admittedly neurotic greeting, but was nice enough not to draw verbal attention to it. Instead, he took the binoculars and muscled Clint out of his spot, rude.\nBecause Clint was a good bro, he did not raise any protests about this addition of one woebegone Captain America to their stakeout. He did, however, lift an eyebrow at Natasha behind his back.\nI thought this was supposed to be reconnaissance, he signed at her. What\u2019s with the red, white, and blue?\nLook at him, she signed back.\nClint looked at him. And, okay, the last time Clint had seen a mortal creature look that hang dog was after Clint had eaten the last slice of pizza in front of Lucky.\nWhat the hell happened? Clint signed. \nNatasha shrugged. He won\u2019t say. Just showed up at my door looking like\u2014that.\n\u201cI know you guys are talking about me behind my back,\u201d Steve said, not lowering his binoculars. \u201cI can see your reflection.\u201d\nClint always admired Natasha\u2019s calm exterior. She barely even batted an eyelash at being caught out. He, on the other hand, jumped about three feet in the air and almost pitched off the side of the roof in his guilty surprise.\n\u201cSorry, Cap,\u201d he said, sheepishly. \u201cYou just don\u2019t come out for reconnaissance that often.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are we looking at?\u201d Steve asked, ignoring Clint\u2019s apology. The harsh slant of his shoulders told Clint enough, anyway. Something bad had happened to Captain Anachronism recently, but it was clearly personal and he just as clearly didn\u2019t want to talk about it. \n\u201cWe,\u201d Clint said, taking pity on the guy and running with his change of topic, \u201care monitoring a tracksuited gang of unspecified Eurasian origin.\u201d\n\u201cThe Russian mafia,\u201d Natasha said, blandly.\n\u201cUnspecified Eurasian origin,\u201d Clint insisted.\nSteve hummed. \u201cWell, I see someone down there, but he\u2019s definitely not wearing a tracksuit.\u201d\n\u201cLet me see that.\u201d Natasha took the binoculars and peered into the next building. Then she burst into a colorful flurry of Russian.\n\u201cNatasha, language,\u201d Steve said, scandalized.\n\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d Clint demanded. That had to be one juicy speech for Steve\u2019s face to look like that.\n\u201cThe pakhan isn\u2019t here yet, you asshole!\u201d Natasha shouted at the man, despite them being way too far away for him to hear. She clicked her tongue. \u201cHe\u2019s going to ruin everything.\u201d\n\u201cYes, but who is he?\u201d \n\u201cHe\u2019s freelance,\u201d Natasha gritted out, the bottom of her face twisting into a scowl as she watched the machine of death and destruction carelessly obliterate months of hard work. \u201cNot much is known about him, except that he\u2019s been credited with over two dozen high profile kills over the span of fifty years\u2014for the wrong team\u2014before he went offline in the early 2000s. He only reappeared five years ago to lay waste to several active HYDRA bases, before he started taking contracts from anyone who paid high enough. Anyone.\u201d\n\u201cGive me those,\u201d Clint said, taking the binoculars from Natasha.\nThere was a man running down the street with a\u2014was that a machine gun? Clint zoomed in. The bottom half of his face was covered by a black mask\u2014sort of like a muzzle, and Clint wondered if it was some sort of advanced filtration device. Long dark hair fell in a tangle to his shoulders\u2014sloppy, anyone close enough could grab a handful and then where would he be? Clint kept warning Natasha that her pretty red hair would end in her decapitation one day, but did anyone ever listen to him? Nooo.\nAs if hearing his thoughts, the man stopped, turned, and looked directly up at Clint.\n\u201cWoah.\u201d Clint stumbled back a step, his heart pounding in his throat. There was no way the dude could see him, not from this distance, but Clint still felt like he\u2019d just been stared down by Death himself. This must have been how Frodo felt when he made eye contact with an orc for the first time: like he was two seconds away from having his jugular ripped out. Hesitantly, he brought the binoculars back up to his eyes. \u201cWho did you say he is?\u201d\n\u201cHe,\u201d Natasha said, icily, \u201cis the Winter Soldier. I hope you weren\u2019t attached to any of those men, since there won\u2019t be much left of them after the Soldier is done.\u201d\n\u201cI think I\u2019m ready to date again,\u201d Steve said.\n\u201cWhat,\u201d Natasha said.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Clint said, lowering his binoculars. He blinked at the dumbstruck look on the Captain\u2019s face, then followed his gaze to where he was staring dopily at\u2014at the Winter fucking Soldier.\n\u201cSteve, no,\u201d Clint groaned.\n\u201cWhatever happened to Stephanie?\u201d Natasha asked, a little desperately. \u201cStephanie was nice. You and Stephanie were good together.\u201d\n\u201cShe dumped me,\u201d Steve said easily, which, no, who dumped Captain America? \u201cI was too boring for her.\u201d\n\u201cBoring?\u201d Clint choked out.\n\u201cSomeone called you boring,\u201d Natasha said, slowly, like she was trying to process. \u201cSo you want to\u2014date the Winter Soldier?\u201d\n\u201cI know it sounds crazy, but.\u201d He raked his fingers through his hair and sighed noisily and with his whole body. \u201cHave you ever looked into someone\u2019s eyes and just\u2014knew?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Natasha said.\nSteve considered her, then cleared his throat and said, \u201cRight, yeah.\u201d\n\u201cThat saying usually applies to people who aren\u2019t international assassins,\u201d Natasha said, pointing at her chest, then giving him a thumbs down. \u201cWhich, as it turns out, also applies to the Winter Soldier.\u201d\n\u201cHold on, hold on,\u201d Clint said, flailing his arms a little. \u201cMaybe my hearing aids are acting up but\u2014but did you just say someone dumped you because you\u2019re boring? You\u2019re Captain America! You\u2014ow, Natasha, wtf?\u201d\n\u201cFirst of all, never say \u2018wtf\u2019 in my presence ever again,\u201d Natasha said, threateningly. \u201cSecond of all\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not Captain America,\u201d Steve said, grabbing the binoculars from Clint so that he could hide his epically broody face.\nClint looked dubiously at Steve\u2019s uniform, and Steve must have been watching him out of the corner of his eye, because he lowered the binoculars again and glared at Clint. \u201cI\u2019m not always Captain America. People find Steve Rogers boring.\u201d\n\u201cAw, Cap, no,\u201d Clint said, reflexively. He wasn\u2019t so sure about this dual personality thing Steve had going on, but he supposed having to be Captain America all the time would be kind of exhausting. \n\u201cYou can do so much better,\u201d Natasha insisted, trying to take the binoculars back from Steve. He didn\u2019t budge. \u201cLiterally anyone. That nurse you used to live down the hall from. She\u2019s cute, and I bet she wouldn\u2019t say no if you asked her out on a date.\u201d She made a frustrated noise when she failed to pry Steve\u2019s fingers from the binoculars and dropped her hands back to her sides. \u201cSteve, you have no idea what he\u2019s done\u2014or what he\u2019s willing to do. Did you miss the part where I said he was on the wrong side? Because he was. For years.\u201d\n\u201cSo were you,\u201d Steve said, with the simple brutality of a wrecking ball. \u201cSo was I, for that matter. Sounds to me like he got himself out of it and is now trying to make amends for his past.\u201d\nNatasha went mute with silent fury, which was never a good sign. Clint didn\u2019t blame her. The Captain had a way of taking an incredibly complex situation and way oversimplifying it.\n\u201cSo\u2014what, so you\u2019re just down for anyone who likes to beat up Nazis?\u201d Clint asked, voice going higher with panic, partially because Natasha was two seconds away from detonating and partially because Steve had lost his fucking mind. \u201cDo you even like men or is it just a Nazi-punching thi\u2014ow, Natasha. I don't have a problem with it, I'm just wondering if he's got a kink\u2014ow!\u201d\n\u201cNazi-punching is a major turn on,\u201d Steve said, flatly.\nClint made a strangled sound as a part of his childhood died a sudden and violent death. \nNatasha folded her arms. \u201cFine. Whatever. Make terrible life choices. Don\u2019t come crying to me when they come back to shoot you in the ass.\u201d\nIn front of them, the house where the tracksuited gang of unspecified Eurasian origin had been enjoying their night of revelry abruptly went up in a huge and glorious fireball. Clint had to admit, murderous machine of destruction or no, the guy had style.\nSteve didn\u2019t have that much experience in courtship, but he had plenty of experience in watching Bucky court women. Although they never had much money to spare, Bucky always managed to scrounge up enough change to treat his dates with small gifts: a dewy bottle of Pepsi, or a cheap bouquet of white daisies.\n(Sometimes, when Steve was feeling particularly self-loathing, he would remember the little gifts Bucky would get him: a peppermint from the corner store, new pencils, cough medicine, fresh bread.)\nThen again, he wasn\u2019t entirely sure how applying Bucky\u2019s methods of romance would work with an international assassin. He had a feeling that if he approached the Soldier with a bouquet of daisies, it would end up shoved somewhere painful and deeply unpleasant.\n\u201cFRIDAY, what can you tell me about the current movements of Codename: Winter Soldier?\u201d Steve asked from where he was sprawled out on his couch, hands tucked behind his head. He wondered what it was about him that kept falling for people who he had a snowball\u2019s chance in hell with. First Bucky, then Peggy (although maybe under different circumstances he could have had a life with her, but, really, their relationship had been doomed from the start), and now the Winter Soldier.\n\u201cThe Winter Soldier placed the equivalent of a billboard advertising his rates in the dark web three and a half days ago,\u201d FRIDAY said. \u201cHe participated in a brief bidding war, and then was hired by a gentleman named Mikhail Mikhailov, who has some issues with the Russian mafia.\u201d\n\u201cCan you give me his exact coordinates?\u201d\n\u201cAs it turns out, I can,\u201d FRIDAY said, pleased. \u201cBlack Widow had requested my assistance in monitoring the mafia several weeks ago. As long as he hasn\u2019t damaged my bugs\u2014ah, there he is.\u201d\nSteve grinned at the ceiling. It had taken him awhile to get used to artificial intelligence\u2014he\u2019d always been adaptable, but living inside a semi-sentient being stretched even the modern definition of \u2018normal\u2019\u2014but he liked FRIDAY. She reminded him of his ma\u2014no nonsense, caustic, full of bull-headed determination. He even thought she had the capacity to be sweet, but this was likely reserved only for Pepper, and sometimes Tony.\n\u201cWhat do you get an international assassin as a gift?\u201d Steve asked.\n\u201cSince I am an AI, I would get him nothing,\u201d FRIDAY said, flatly.\n\u201cIf you could.\u201d\n\u201cI have no experience in gift giving and therefore cannot give adequate advice,\u201d FRIDAY said. She always sounded so sarcastic. Steve was pretty sure this was by design. \u201cWould you like me to Google it for you?\u201d \n\u201cI know how to Google,\u201d Steve said, offended. \u201cI just don\u2019t think \u2018what do you gift an international assassin\u2019 would net me useful results.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d FRIDAY said, with the patience of a long suffering mother, \u201cassassins like guns. Why don\u2019t you get him a new gun?\u201d\n\u201cHmmm.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve sent the Winter Soldier\u2019s coordinates to your phone,\u201d FRIDAY said. \u201cI strongly suggest not going to them.\u201d\n\nWidow: Whatever you\u2019re thinking, stop\n\n\nWidow: I reiterate, stop\n\n\nWidow: The Winter Soldier does not want to be your boyfriend\n\n\nCap: That\u2019s quitter talk\n\nNew York rush hour was a heaving mass of pedestrians versus vehicle traffic. One thing that still threw Steve for a lurch was how many more people there were on the planet. New York had already been overcrowded when he was a kid, its population increasing daily with immigrants and country-folk hopeful for work, but this shiny new century was mind boggling. Sometimes, the sidewalks were so packed that it took Steve an extra ten minutes just to get back from the coffee shop. \nAt this hour, it was late enough that the morning traffic had died down, but early enough that the lunch rush had not yet started. Hands in his pockets, he strolled toward the coordinates FRIDAY had sent him. He wasn\u2019t in any hurry, since he still had no idea what to get the Soldier. He couldn\u2019t quite convince himself that \u2018a new gun\u2019 was an appropriate gift, on topic though it was. Maybe\u2014a jacket? A new bulletproof vest?\n\u201cCaptain Rogers!\u201d Murad called from his food cart, grinning so broadly that Steve could see his back molars. During the attack on New York, Steve had saved the older man from getting crushed by an alien whale. As thanks, Murad supplied him with a lifetime of free falafels. \n\u201cHey, Murad.\u201d\n\u201cThe usual?\u201d Murad asked, already dumping a huge mound of rice in a styrofoam to go container. \n\u201cMurad, what do you get an international assassin as a gift?\u201d Steve asked. He was beginning to feel like one of those kid\u2019s books, where the cartoon bear went around the jungle, asking everyone if they\u2019d seen his hat.\nTo his credit, Murad didn\u2019t even blink. \u201cA number one with a side of fries,\u201d he said.\nSteve smirked, although\u2014that actually wasn\u2019t a bad idea. What was that old saying? \u2018The way to a man\u2019s heart was through his stomach.\u2019 It was true enough for him\u2014maybe he could apply the same logic to the Winter Soldier. Unless the man was a robot like Vision (actually, Natasha had said something about him being alive for over fifty years, so the idea had merit), there was nothing like the gift of New York street food.\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll take a number one with fries,\u201d Steve said.\n\u201cExcellent choice.\u201d Murad expertly flipped open another container. \u201cFinally putting the moves on the Black Widow, eh? Good for you. Personally, she scares the hell out of me, but good for you.\u201d\nSteve didn\u2019t bother to correct him. He was pretty certain that if he told Murad who he was actually interested in, he would join Natasha and Clint\u2019s campaign to \u2018get Steve to see reason.\u2019 Which just wasn\u2019t going to happen. Not even Bucky could get him to see reason.\n\u201cThanks, Murad,\u201d Steve said, taking the two paper bags.\nMurad saluted him cheerfully. \u201cLet me know how it goes, boss!\u201d\nEven with the coordinates, it was tricky to find the Winter Soldier. He, unfortunately, was not just standing in the middle of the street, waiting for Steve with open arms. Nor was he inside the house the coordinates had indicated. He was, somewhat unsurprisingly, on the roof. As silently as he could with two bags of falafels clenched between his teeth, Steve climbed the tree next to the house. He got his feet under him, then leapt onto the roof, just behind the Winter Soldier.\nThe Soldier whirled around. A cold, hard weight pressed heavy into Steve\u2019s sternum. Steve lifted both his hands. He was familiar enough with that sensation to know that the Soldier had a gun pressed to his chest.\nFor the second time, Steve saw the Soldier\u2019s eyes. Up close, they were roughly fifty times more devastating. The Soldier\u2019s eyes were a shade of gray that made tears well up in Steve\u2019s throat. They weren\u2019t quite right\u2014too pale, with too many lines etched in the corners, and far too devoid of life and laughter, but they were achingly, shatteringly familiar.\nHe wondered if it were possible to fall in love with a pair of eyes.\n\u201cSorry, sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to startle you,\u201d Steve said, scrunching his eyebrows and grinning sheepishly. He shook the greasy bag in his left hand slightly. The Soldier\u2019s eyes darted toward it, just for a second. \u201cI come bearing falafels.\u201d\nAlthough the Soldier didn\u2019t so much as twitch a muscle, something about his entire posture demanded to know if Steve was out of his fucking mind. He\u2014probably was, if he were being honest with himself.\n\u201cI mean,\u201d Steve babbled. \u201cYou must be hungry, right? I can\u2019t imagine being out here for hours without taking a break to eat. Then again, I need to fuel up often and with great excess. Metabolism like a cheetah, so I\u2019m told. I used to not require as much food, but\u201d\u2014the Soldier\u2019s eyes narrowed fractionally\u2014\u201cRight, yeah, you really don\u2019t need to know my life entire life story, sorry.\u201d\nProbably deciding that Steve was too stupid to be a threat (which, again: accurate), the Soldier holstered his pistol, quick as a flash, and then snatched both of the bags out of Steve\u2019s hand.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not poisoned,\u201d Steve said, then mentally kicked himself when the Soldier\u2019s glare went from suspicious to apocalyptic. \u201cNo, seriously! I wouldn\u2019t do something like that. Do\u2014uh, do you want me to try some, to prove it to you? Only, if you\u2019re going to chuck it because of my big stupid mouth, please don\u2019t\u2014that would be wasteful.\u201d\nSteve closed his big stupid mouth with a click of teeth, then tipped his head back and stared up at the sky. Maybe he should call Thor and have him hit him with a bolt of lightning. Maybe that would get him to shut his fucking mouth.\nThere was a crinkle of paper. The Soldier had opened the bag and was peering inside it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s delicious,\u201d Steve said, encouragingly.\nThe Soldier stared at him.\nSteve beamed.\nWho knows how long they would have stood there, with the Soldier working through different ways to murder Steve while Steve smiled sunnily at him, if Steve had not suddenly realized just why the Soldier was staring at him.\n\u201cOh! Oh, of course. You\u2019re not going to take your mask off in front of me to eat.\u201d Steve coughed into his fist, heat prickling up the back of his neck. God, he hadn\u2019t blushed since he was thirteen. Somewhere in the afterlife, Bucky was cringing with despair and second-hand embarrassment. \u201cRight. Well, I hope you enjoy!\u201d Then, with a dorky little wave, Steve turned on his heel and beat a strategic retreat off the edge of the roof.\nPaper crumpled beneath metal fingers. From the bag: onions, garlic, grease, salt. The Winter Soldier watched the blond man walk away.\nBroad shoulders. Broad smile. Hands that were too large for his body\u2014no. That was incorrect. Eyes that were a sweet blue. Eyes that hadn\u2019t changed when\u2014\nThe Soldier turned back to his lookout spot. It had been compromised. Instead of doing the smart thing, such as finding a new lookout, he lowered his mask. Took a falafel between metal fingers and popped the whole thing in his mouth. Weird kid, but he was right: the food was fucking delicious.\nThank god Dr. Doom attacked on Friday, keeping Captain America busy for the next several days. That\u2019s what the big guy needed\u2014some new baddie to distract him from his little crush on the Winter Soldier.\n\u201cHe\u2019s probably forgot all about him,\u201d Clint said, optimistically. He rubbed the side of his nose. It had been broken again when a group of thugs from the tracksuited gang of unspecified Eurasian origin had jumped him in an alley.\nNatasha shifted the greasy bag of Chinese food into her other hand, fishing her phone from her back pocket. She held it up to the number pad next to Steve\u2019s door. \u201cYou clearly don\u2019t know Steve like I do.\u201d\n\u201cAre you breaking into Steve\u2019s floor?\u201d Clint asked, scandalized.\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said. The door swished open.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Clint said, as he followed her into Steve\u2019s rooms. \u201cI\u2019m just saying, he\u2019s only seen the guy twice, for like, two minutes. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he\u2014\u201d He froze, words fizzling out in his throat.\nSteve was seated at his kitchen table, loose sheaves of printed out blog posts spread out in front of him, a laptop open to his left. There were several books garishly covered with half naked men and buxom women stacked in two small piles on the table. On the right, the books were painstakingly indexed with colorful tabs. On the left, the books were unmarked. Steve held one book flat open in front of him, drawing a line across the page with a bright pink highlighter. \n\u201cOh my god,\u201d Clint said. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\nJumping in surprise, Steve quickly snapped the book shut, hiding the cover with his hand. As if there weren\u2019t piles of incriminating evidence stacked around him.\n\u201cClint,\u201d he said, eyes round in embarrassed surprise. \u201cNatasha. This isn\u2019t what it looks like.\u201d\n\u201cIt looks like you cleared out the entire romance section of The Strand,\u201d said Natasha, setting the bag of Chinese food on Steve\u2019s kitchen counter.\n\u201cNot the entire section,\" Steve protested.\nClint lowered himself into the chair across from him, grabbing a book from the stack Steve hadn\u2019t gone through yet. He lifted his eyebrows. \u201cFaking It?\u201d \nSteve flipped open the book he\u2019d been working on, pressing a tab onto the page next to the passage he had highlighted. \u201cI think that one is about a fake relationship,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems to be a theme in a lot of these books.\u201d\nClint smirked. He highly doubted this one was about a fake relationship. Really, how Steve managed to get through these stacks of books without rupturing something from blushing\u2014\n\u201cEither that, or it\u2019s about faking orgasms,\u201d Steve continued, plowing through Clint\u2019s smug amusement like Hulk smashing through a wall. He didn\u2019t even look up, although Clint was certain he was fully aware that he had just scored a point off him. \u201cIt\u2019s a trope.\u201d He waved a hand at a spiral notebook, where he was, apparently, taking notes on romance novel tropes.\nWhile Clint was busy picking up the shattered bits of his sanity, Natasha dropped into the chair beside him. She handed him a carton of lo mein and a pair of chopsticks. \u201cAre you also taking notes on how many times the words \u2018moist\u2019 and \u2018shaft\u2019 have been used?\u201d she asked, digging out a potsticker from another carton before handing it to Steve.\n\u201cAnd \u2018velvet\u2019,\u2019 said Steve, refusing to blush, although Clint physically recoiled at the word \u2018moist.\u2019 \u201c\u2018Throbbing manhood\u2019 is a personal favorite.\u201d\n\u201cSteve, what are you doing,\u201d Natasha asked, long suffering.\n\u201cStudying.\u201d\nNatasha lifted a skeptical eyebrow at him.\n\u201cI\u2019m a tactical genius,\u201d Steve said, primly. \u201cI like to plan.\u201d\n\u201cThis is planning?\u201d Clint demanded, a little hysterically. \n\u201cIt\u2019s research,\u201d Steve insisted. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of modern literature around courtship. It\u2019s been very helpful.\u201d His eyebrows crinkled together slightly. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I can accomplish the degree of sass these characters pull off, though.\u201d\n\u201cOh I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll manage,\u201d said Natasha, who\u2019d had plenty of time to get to know the true Steve Rogers. \u201cYou might get stabbed for it, but you\u2019ll manage.\u201d\nSteve flashed a toothy grin at her, then stole her carton of fried rice. Which would have been a declaration of war if Clint had pulled the same move, but Natasha just stole the greasy carton of lo mein from Clint in response. Clint stared despondently at his empty hands until Natasha took pity on him and handed him the soup dumplings.\n\u201cSo, with all your \u2018research\u2019,\u201d Clint said, making air quotes with his chopsticks, \u201cwhat\u2019s your brilliant plan?\u201d\nSteve scanned the table with a mildly despairing look before his eyes landed back on Clint. \u201cI was thinking about getting him a gun.\u201d\nNatasha scoffed. \u201cWhat, because he doesn\u2019t have enough ways to violently murder you? What kind of books are these, anyway? I refuse to believe you got this brilliant idea from Faking It.\u201d\n\u201cFRIDAY suggested it.\u201d\n\u201cIt makes the most logical sense,\u201d FRIDAY chimed in, sounding both prim and put upon.\nClint rubbed his nose, then stopped because, ow. \u201cListen,\u201d he said, \u201cAs the only one in the room with actual romantic experience\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re divorced,\u201d Natasha said. \nWhen Clint glared at her, she just stared back flatly. He prudently decided to ignore her interruption and continued with, \u201c\u2014take my advice and get him something he can\u2019t kill you with, like chocolates.\u201d\nNatasha looked shifty. Actually, Natasha\u2019s expression hadn\u2019t changed at all, but Clint was extremely familiar with that particular brand of quiet disdain.\n\u201cOooor,\u201d he said, squinting at her. \u201cHe can actually kill you with chocolate. What can\u2019t he kill you with?\u201d Natasha shrugged, which was\u2014wow. \u201cAre you sure you want to date this guy, Cap?\u201d\n\u201cYep,\u201d said Steve, pouring the rest of the fried rice directly into his mouth. \nNatasha leaned forward, resting one arm on the table. \u201cWhat are you going to do if he agrees to a date? You can\u2019t exactly take him to the movies,\u201d she said, and Clint was immediately bombarded with the image of Captain America sitting next to the Winter Soldier in a movie theater, both in full combat gear, the Captain offering the Soldier some popcorn, \u201cor to dinner.\u201d And Clint\u2019s mental image shifted to the two of them sitting across from each other in a fancy restaurant, the Soldier staring stoically down at his steak and potatoes, like he could will his food directly into his stomach.\nIt was too much for him. He laughed.\nSteve didn\u2019t even look up from the carton of dumplings he was rapidly demolishing when he threw Faking It at Clint\u2019s chest.\n\u201cI\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d Steve said, with the stubborn conviction of a man who had no idea what he was getting himself into. \u201cFor now, I just need to figure out how to get him to actually agree to go on a date with me.\u201d\n\u201cOffer him your throbbing manhood,\u201d Clint muttered, then yelped when Steve kicked him on the shin.\nThe Soldier adjusted his rifle. He zoomed in on the blond man gently terrorizing a convenience store clerk.\nKazimierz Kazimierczak. Alias Kazi. Alias Clown. Runs around with his face painted white and a tear painted under one eye. A trigger man hired by the Russian mafia to clear out the apartments in Bed Stuy. Responsible for eighteen deaths, including Mikhailov\u2019s wife and young daughter.\nHYDRA.\nThe Soldier exhaled a long breath. Depressed his finger on the trigger.\nA hand fell heavy on the Soldier\u2019s shoulder. \n\u201cWell well well, if it isn\u2019t my old friend the Winter Soldier. What are we doing out here, eh?\u201d\nThe Soldier looked down at the hand. It was encased in a metal exoskeleton, humming with power. Strong. Held the Soldier\u2019s arm firmly in place.\nThe Soldier wrenched back. Metal ground against metal. He pivoted around and ripped out the pistol from his thigh holster, all in one fluid movement.\nCrossbones grinned at him. He wasn\u2019t wearing his mask. The smile creased and pocked the ruin of his cheek.\nThe Soldier examined the side of Crossbones\u2019 face. \n\u201cOuch,\u201d he said.\nThe scar tissue on Crossbones\u2019 face tightened into a sneer. He reached out one power-fist and grabbed the front of the Soldier\u2019s shirt. \u201cYou did this to me,\u201d he snarled.\nHe had. He had dropped a building on Crossbones\u2019 head. He would drop two more buildings on Crossbones\u2019 head without a second thought.\nHe was just about to unload his gun into the unscarred side of Crossbones\u2019 face when something exploded against the back of Crossbones\u2019 head, startling him enough to release the Soldier\u2019s shirt. Quick as a viper, the Soldier wrapped his left hand around Crossbones\u2019 neck and pressed his gun against his temple.\nThe Soldier glanced down to see what had hit Crossbones. Little creamy brown squares were scattered around their feet. The Soldier nudged one with his toe.\nIt was chocolate.\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d the blond man with the falafels asked, jogging up to the Soldier.\nCrossbones gurgled. Without taking his eyes off the newcomer, the Soldier applied slightly more pressure to Crossbones\u2019 neck. A warning.\nThere were several ways he could terminate both Crossbones and the man, if the man attempted to rescue Crossbones. But the blond just watched him with a carefully neutral expression, no judgement in his kind blue eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s HYDRA, right?\u201d \nThe Soldier\u2019s hand spasmed. Crossbones tried to suck in a wheezing breath. The Soldier ground the muzzle of his gun harder into Crossbones\u2019 temple, but he did not squeeze the trigger.\n\u201cIf you want,\u201d the blond said, calmly, \u201cI know some people. I can guarantee that he\u2019ll never see the light of day again.\u201d He shrugged one shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s up to you.\u201d\nThe Soldier stared into the side of Crossbones\u2019 face. Crossbones scowled back out of the corner of his eye, hateful. It would be simple to end things now, a clean shot to the temple, or between the eyes. A permanent solution. The Soldier glanced at the blond man, but there was nothing to guide him in those blue eyes.\nUnclenching his fingers, the Soldier released Crossbones. He landed hard, gasping, and rolled over onto his back, but before he could get to his feet again, the blond put a foot on his face. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that if I were you,\u201d the blond said, pleasantly.\nThe Soldier sank back on his heels, silently observing the interaction. Crossbones had immediately stilled under the blond man\u2019s foot, not even attempting to fight. There was more to the blond man than the Soldier had first surmised. A threat? But then, why the falafels?\n\u201cSorry about the chocolate,\u201d the blond said, frowning with mild disappointment. He perked up suddenly. \u201cBut\u2014here.\u201d\nSeemingly out of nowhere, he whipped out something small and rectangular. The Soldier instinctively jerked up his gun. \nThe man\u2019s expression fell slightly. \u201cIt\u2019s, uh, it\u2019s chocolate. I wanted to see what all the fuss was about\u2014I mean, here.\u201d He held out the bar of chocolate to him, rubbing the back of his neck like it was the 30s again and this mook had disappointed yet another date the Soldier had gone to the trouble to set him up with\u2014\nThe Soldier stumbled back, eyes widening. Then he snatched the bar of chocolate out of the blond\u2019s hand, turned on his heel, and sprinted away.\nThe Soldier sat on his apartment\u2019s fire escape, cross-legged, in a pair of old sweats and a T-shirt, hair swept back in a low tail. With his metal hand, he tore the bar of chocolate in half, not even bothering to peel off the paper. He broke off a small square and popped it in his mouth, then closed his eyes, letting the milky-sweet chocolate melt on his tongue for a second. Then he bit into it. It crunched with toffee.\nMy favorite, he thought, and then deliberately did not think again.\nHe stared into the street below, eyes unfocused. Soon, the daily chatter of the city died down as people made their way indoors. Warm yellow lights flickered on in nearby windows. Occasionally, a figure moved within his sight line, an easy target.\nThe Soldier got to his feet. He required more intel.\nNatasha would rather die than admit it out loud, but the Winter Soldier scared the fuck out of her. Before, when he was the asset, he was a mindless, ruthless killing machine that stopped at nothing to get his job done, that was a \u2018that\u2019 instead of a \u2018who.\u2019\nThen he had gotten out, and the ruin he had left in his wake\u2014it stayed with a person. And while he seemed less inclined to shoot through her to get to his target these days, he still had that fixed look more suited for a reptile on the hunt than a functional human being.\nSo when he showed up at her window, unannounced, in the middle of the night, she did what any sane person would do: she shot him.\nQuicker than her eye could follow, he lifted his left arm, and the bullets rang harmlessly off metal, pinging away in every direction. Since being killed by the Winter Soldier was marginally less likely than accidentally being killed by a ricocheting bullet, Natasha set her gun down on her duvet. The Winter Soldier set his own gun down on the window sill. She hadn\u2019t even realized he had it pointed at her, Jesus. \n\u201cAre you here for information about Ivan Banionis?\u201d Natasha asked, settling her hands on her lap and not bothering to get out of bed. \nThe Winter Soldier stared at her, dead-eyed.\n\u201cNo? So it\u2019s a courtesy call, then.\u201d\nThe Soldier tilted his head, just a fraction. For a long moment, Natasha watched him watching her. The room was so quiet that she could hear the hum of her refrigerator on the other side of her wall. She wondered if he ever had a thought go through that head of his, or if he was like she had been\u2014all automatic movement, like a murderous robot. \nThe problem with being reintroduced into society was that Natasha wasn\u2019t sure she could out-wait the Soldier anymore. Ten years ago, definitely. Possibly even five years ago. This was one of the down sides of being civilized. \u201cWell?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cWhy does your big blond friend keep feeding me,\u201d the Soldier asked, flatly.\nThe corner of Natasha\u2019s mouth tipped up into a smile. With his mask and dead eyes, it was impossible to tell by his expression how he felt, but Natasha could detect a hint of irritation in his voice. \u201cIf you want him to stop, just say the word, and you\u2019ll never see him again.\u201d\nThe Soldier considered her. There was no visible change to his expression. Then he said, \u201cI would just like to understand.\u201d\nYou and me both, buddy, Natasha thought. Out loud, she said, \u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask him, then.\u201d\nAh, there it was. The insides of the Soldier\u2019s eyebrows had furrowed slightly in confusion. Natasha\u2019s grin widened into something sharper. \u201cSoldier.\u201d\nHis eyes fixed on hers.\n\u201cIf you hurt him, I will salt the earth with your ashes.\u201d\nThe Soldier didn\u2019t blink. Then he said, \u201cYou should look into Kazimierz Kazimierczak.\u201d He turned around, one hand braced on the window. Then he looked over his shoulder and added, \u201cAshes are an effective fertilizer,\u201d and disappeared back out the window.\n\u201cNot human ashes!\u201d Natasha shouted after him, then sighed and flopped back onto her bed before her neighbors complained about her. Again.\nFor a long moment, she stared blankly up at her ceiling. Jesus Christ. Had she really just given the shovel talk to the Winter Soldier?\n\nWidow: Your boyfriend visited me last night\n\n\nWidow: I shot him, but he\u2019s okay\n\nSteve frowned down at his phone, not stopping to type out his response. Around his feet, wind swirled up litter into a small cyclone before dancing away again. \n\nCap: Stop shooting him\n\n\nWidow: Only if he stops breaking into my apartment\n\n\nCap: Why did he break into your apartment?\n\nWhen she didn\u2019t respond right away, Steve called her, but of course she didn\u2019t pick up. With a sigh, he locked his phone and dropped it back into his pocket. Likely the Soldier had gone to Natasha to gather more intel. He hoped she only said good things about him. \nOn mornings like this, brisk and with a chilly wind, Bucky used to bundle them both up and and drag Steve all around the city. He had liked the way the girls looked in their long coats and fur stoles, and how their skirts swirled around their calves. Steve had liked the way the crisp air made Bucky\u2019s cheeks pink up and how his eyes glowed with happiness.\nTwo women hurried past Steve now, but they were dressed in huge puffy jackets, with thick beanies pulled low over their ears and scarves wound around the lower halves of their faces, and were hunched up against the wind.\nWell. Maybe it was colder than he realized. Sometimes, it was hard to tell with this big body of his. His temperature just auto-regulated these days. \nWashington Square Park was quiet for a Saturday; even the man who normally played piano near the Arch had apparently decided to stay indoors today. Steve slid his hands into his pockets, contemplating his next steps. The Soldier had accepted Steve\u2019s gifts, but Steve wasn\u2019t entirely sure he understood the context of the gifts. He needed to\u2014\nSomething slammed violently into his back, hard enough to send him sprawling onto the pavement. He landed on his shoulder, and was just about to shove himself back to his feet when the Winter Soldier strode up to him. Steve froze. This gave the Soldier enough time to step up onto his back.\n\u201cOof,\u201d Steve said.\n\u201cI seem to have acquired a superhero stalker,\u201d the Winter Soldier said, standing on top of Steve like he was a throw rug.\nIt was the first time Steve heard the Winter Soldier speak. His voice was quiet and raspy, and hummed into Steve\u2019s bones like an electric current. He didn\u2019t even try to throw the Soldier off his back, even though this was incredibly embarrassing. It would be just his luck if Tony had a camera pointed at him right now.\n\u201cI\u2019m not stalking you,\u201d Steve told the pavement. He tried not to think of what was on this ground. The serum should take care of any communicable diseases. Probably. \n\u201cThe falafel,\u201d the Winter Soldier said, and Steve could picture him ticking off his fingers. \u201cSaving me from Crossbones, which I didn\u2019t need by the way. The chocolate. If you\u2019re not stalking me, what are you doing.\u201d\nNow Steve was glad his face was pressed against the revolting pavement. His cheeks burned. \u201cUh,\u201d he said.\nThe Winter Soldier bounced on his heels, which was surprisingly painful, since the Soldier was surprisingly heavy. \u201cWell?\u201d\n\u201cI was kind of\u2014trying to maybe court you?\u201d Steve said, voice ticking up into a question.\nThe Winter Soldier went very still. \u201cWhat.\u201d\n\u201cI mean, I don\u2019t know what people call it these days. Woo you? Date you?\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know nothing about me, sweetheart.\u201d\nSteve wasn\u2019t sure if it was because his ear was currently being ground against the pavement, but he thought he could hear a hint of Brooklyn in the Soldier\u2019s voice. He shivered slightly. It had nothing to do with the cold.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that why you go on dates? To get to know the other person?\u201d\nThere was a pregnant silence.\nThe weight slowly vanished from his back. Steve flipped over and kicked back up to his feet, but by the time he was vertical again, the Soldier was long gone.\nSteve tapped his pencil against his lips, staring down at his list.\n\nHow to Woo the Winter Soldier\n\n\nStep 1: Get him a gift\n\n\nStep 2: Help when he\u2019s in need\n\n\nStep 3: ???\n\nSteve needed help.\nIt used to be that Bucky would give him heaps of unwanted advice, usually something like, you just gotta have confidence! Ladies love a guy who knows what he\u2019s doing. Fat lotta good that did him. Steve had no idea what he was doing in the 1930s\u2014he was pretty much an incompetent potato in the modern era.\nSteve thought about how Bucky used to sidle up to women on the street, cool as anything, cigarette tucked between his fingers and knock-your-socks-off smile at the ready. The girls would dip their eyelashes and blush prettily, and always, always smile back.\nHe tried to imagine the Winter Soldier blushing prettily and averting his eyes, and snorted.\nHe added a subtitle: What Would Bucky Do?\nThen he erased the question marks and added:\n\nStep 3: Flirt\n\n\u201cI need help flirting,\u201d Steve said, into his phone.\n\u201cOh, oh, hit him with this line: girl, did you fall out of a tree? Because you look like a finecone,\u201d said Clint. \u201cYou know, like pinecone? And coz, you know, he likes to creep around in trees.\u201d\nSteve hung up on him.\n\u201cI need help flirting,\u201d Steve said, into his phone.\n\u201cNo,\u201d FRIDAY said.\n\u201cI need help flirting,\u201d Steve said, into his phone.\n\u201cIf you call me at one a.m. with your self-inflicted drama again I will kill you,\u201d Natasha said, and hung up on him.\nSam reached out one hand from under his comforter to snatch his cellphone from his nightstand. Then he chucked it at the wall and rolled over. Whoever was calling him at one in the fucking morning could try again at a more appropriate hour.\nHe squeezed his eyes shut for another five seconds, then exhaled an explosive breath and flopped onto his back, hands smacking onto his comforter.\n\u201cThe world better be fucking ending,\u201d he muttered, swinging his legs off the side of his bed, bare feet slapping against cold wood floor. He grabbed his phone from where it had landed by his bedroom door and glared down at the screen.\n\n1 missed call\n\n\n3 text messages\n\nSam sighed. Great. The world probably was ending. Again. Why did it always happen on his day off, huh? All he asked for was one day where he could just bum around on his couch and not fight robot nazis.\nHe opened the text messages.\n\nHawkeye: tell him that finecone is a perfect pick up line\n\n\nBlack Widow: he\u2019s your problem now\n\n\nCap: how to flirt\n\n\u201cLord preserve me,\u201d Sam muttered. He shot back a text to Steve telling him to tucking google it, then he dropped his phone back to the floor and crawled back into his bed.\nSteve Googled it.\n\nHow to Flirt: A Guide\n\n1. Smile a lot and maintain eye contact. \n\u201cYou are not allowed to tell anyone you caught me doing that,\u201d Steve said, into his phone.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t tell anyone I caught you practicing pick up lines in your bathroom mirror,\u201d FRIDAY said, offended. \u201cI would show them the video I recorded.\u201d\n\u201cTony programmed way too much of his personality into you,\u201d Steve muttered. He wondered what it said about his life that arguing with an AI wasn\u2019t even weird to him anymore. \u201cWhere did you say he was last spotted?\u201d\n\u201cThe Winter Soldier was last seen leaving Russ &amp; Daughters.\u201d\nSteve stopped on the corner of Houston and Orchard, a rock in the middle of the stream of pedestrians. He got some dirty looks, a couple of wide eyed stares, and one person took a picture of him. Ignoring everyone, he scanned the street for familiar gray eyes and shaggy brown hair.\nNothing.\n\u201cYou\u2019re sure he\u2019s here?\u201d Steve asked.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not sure. I just had real-time footage of the Winter Soldier leaving the cafe transmitted to me from an ARGUS satellite. I suppose it is possible that the military-grade tech was mistaken, however.\u201d\n\u201cDid Tony program you to be this sarcastic or did you evolve?\u201d\nFRIDAY didn\u2019t answer, which honestly could mean either way. \nA blue Volkswagen bug nearly as old as Steve rumbled by, emitting a thick cloud of black smoke. Steve wrinkled his nose and glared after it, wondering how it managed to pass its smog check, and then the Winter Soldier was just\u2014there. Standing across the street, a plastic bag dangling off the crook of his elbow, his normal mask replaced by a black scarf wrapped around the bottom half of his face. Seeing him like this, dressed casually in a black coat with a faux fur trimmed hood and pants tucked into his unlaced boots, with his hair pulled away from his face in a low bun at the base of his neck, made Steve\u2019s heart give a funny little twitch.\nBe cool, Steve told himself. One of the things the article stressed was not to appear overeager. \n\u201cHey!\u201d Steve shouted, waving both his hands at the Soldier.\nThe Soldier closed his eyes, pained, as Steve jogged across the street, dodging incoming vehicles like a pro. Channeling 1930s Bucky after a couple of drinks and in his finest form, Steve swaggered up to the Soldier\u2019s side. Walking like this felt unnatural, and probably looked ridiculous, but the Soldier didn\u2019t punch him in the face or run away. Steve counted it as a win.\n\u201cHey.\u201d Steve slid his hands into his pockets, angling his body toward the Soldier in a way that he hoped said \u2018open\u2019 and \u2018inviting\u2019 and not \u2018easy target.\u2019 He put on his most charming smile, fixing his gaze on the Soldier\u2019s heartbreaking gray eyes.\nThe Soldier immediately shifted back, brow darkening dangerously. \u201cWhat are you doing.\u201d His voice was slightly muffled by the thick scarf, which took away some of the threat.\n\u201cBeing seductive,\u201d said Steve, earnestly. After a beat of the Soldier gaping at him, he added, hopefully, \u201cIs it working?\u201d\nThe Soldier let out a strangled sound\u2014almost a laugh. His eyes widened slightly at this involuntary reaction.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said, after a moment. \u201cI am not seduced.\u201d\nSteve rolled his lips together, but didn\u2019t drop his gaze. The article on flirting Steve had studied clearly said looking deeply into someone\u2019s eyes was considered romantic. \nUnfortunately, the article did not account for how an international mercenary with a dark past might react to direct eye contact. The Soldier put up with Steve staring dopily at him for about five seconds before he crouched down and swept his legs out from under him in a clean, single-leg sweep.\nSteve lay flat on his back, arms sprawled out at his sides. Beyond the looming skyscrapers, the sky was thick with gray storm clouds. He could only hope that the rain would wash away all his bad decisions. \nThe Soldier\u2019s face appeared in his sight line.\n\u201cI was looking deeply into your eyes,\u201d Steve explained, tilting his head slightly to stare deeply and non-threateningly at the Soldier\u2019s left cheek. \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to challenge you.\u201d\nThe Soldier snorted, clearly unimpressed. He turned away, then paused. \u201cNext time,\u201d he said, over his shoulder, \u201cstick with falafels.\u201d And then he was gone.\nSteve rolled his head back toward the sky, watching the clouds tumble rapidly overhead, and grinned.\n\u00a0\n\n2. Touch him casually.\n\n\u201cHey, Murad.\u201d\nMurad jumped slightly, dropping his phone. He performed a complicated dance to keep it from smashing to the sidewalk, then held it up triumphantly when he managed to catch it, displaying a giant GAME OVER on his screen.\n\u201cOh, I was about to beat my high score,\u201d said Murad, mournfully.\n\u201cSorry about that.\u201d Steve smiled at him, handing over a steaming to-go cup of coffee from a nearby bodega. The street was nearly dead, everyone hiding from the cold indoors. Murad was barely recognizable under a thick layer of scarves, jackets, and beanies, but he\u2019d had yet to abandon his cart. Steve had to admire his tenacity.\n\u201cCaptain Rogers! You\u2019re too kind.\u201d Murad fumbled his phone back into his pocket, clumsy due to a thick pair of snow gloves, and flipped open a styrofoam container. \u201cNice to see another face out here\u2014although what are you wearing?\u201d he demanded, his eyebrows disappeared under his beanie at Steve\u2019s jeans and a hoodie.\n\u201cI don\u2019t get cold easily,\u201d Steve explained, with a self-deprecating shrug. It was a far cry from how things used to be, when his skinny body would be wracked with never ending shivers if the thermostat dipped below sixty.\n\u201cSuper soldiers. Next time you see one of your fancy scientists, hook me up with some of that super juice, okay?\u201d Murad said cheerfully. He piled a huge helping of rice into the container. \u201cWell? How goes your courtship of the international assassin? Have you won her over yet?\u201d \n\u201cJury\u2019s still out, but the verdict is looking promising,\u201d Steve said, resting back on his heels. He grinned crookedly. \u201cActually, what was that you suggested last time? A number one with fries?\u201d\nWhat was visible of Murad\u2019s face lit up, nose scrunching and lines crinkling around his eyes from the force of his grin. \u201cWhat did I say, eh? Works every time. Tell you what\u2014this one is on the house. If this doesn\u2019t seal the deal, you have her come to me and I\u2019ll talk to her, okay?\u201d\nSteve left Murad a generous tip and strolled toward the building where he had first met the Soldier. Since it was approximately four degrees outside, the chances of Steve finding the Soldier were slim to none\u2014although maybe the 'Winter' part of his name indicated a seasonal preference. Steve doubted it. But the Soldier had requested falafels, and Steve didn't want to risk running into him empty handed. His ma had always told him to be prepared for the unexpected.\nSuch as now. Steve was just about to cross the street when the Soldier stepped out from around the corner, blocking his path.\n\u201cOh!\u201d Steve said. Was the Soldier actively seeking him out? The thought made hope sparkle in his chest.\nThe Soldier cocked an expectant eyebrow, as if to say, Well? What have you brought for me today? Like Steve, he was under-dressed for the weather, wearing nothing but that coat with the faux-fur lined hood, a pair of jeans, and a scarf wrapped around the lower half of his face. His scarf was red today. For some reason, that completely charmed Steve.\n\u201cI have more falafels,\u201d Steve said, holding out the paper bag.\nThis time, the Soldier didn\u2019t hesitate when he took the bag. He opened it, peering inside as if the make sure Steve hadn\u2019t forgotten the fries.\nThis was the perfect opportunity to \u2018break the touch barrier.\u2019 Steve lifted his hand to rest it companionably on the Soldier\u2019s shoulder, but he must have moved too quickly because the Soldier snapped a warning look at him. Steve\u2019s hand continued its upward journey to rub the back of his neck sheepishly. \n\u201cWell, enjoy!\u201d he said, cheerfully, then spun around on his heel, shoved his hands into his pockets, and hurried away.\n\u00a0\n\n3. Compliment him.\n\n\u201cCaptain.\u201d\nSteve looked up from Bridget Jones\u2019s Diary, one of the romance novels he\u2019d picked up for his grand tactical plan. He\u2019d given that up as a method of research, but he was beginning to feel a solidarity with some of these characters. He could relate to the feeling of not having his shit together. \u201cYes, FRIDAY?\u201d\n\u201cI believe the Soldier is calling you.\u201d\nSteve frowned, closing his book. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s been staring at one of my bugs for the past five minutes.\u201d\nSteve got to his feet so quickly he accidentally banged his shin into the corner of his coffee table. \u201cWhat? Where is he? Is he still there?\u201d\nFRIDAY sighed, which had to be a new feature and was completely pointless except to make the recipient feel as tragic as possible. As Steve tugged on his boot, hopping on one foot, he briefly wondered how much of their interactions FRIDAY was reporting back to Tony in Malibu. Enough for the other man to have a lifetime of blackmail on him, at least. \n\u201cHe\u2019s in Bed Stuy at a bar called Swell Dive.\u201d\nSteve paused mid-hop. Damn. It would take him over an hour to get there if he took the subway. \n\u201cCan I borrow one of the quinjets?\u201d Steve asked.\n\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d FRIDAY said.\nSince FRIDAY refused to unbend no matter how much Steve pleaded, he took his bike instead of risking the notoriously unpredictable subway. This shaved exactly five minutes off his trip, thanks to traffic. Steve double-parked his bike next to a beater car in front of Swell Dive, shaking off the snow he'd collected from his drive, and slammed into the bar.\nSwell Dive was small and dark, with wood tables to match its wood floors. It was crowded with kids willing to brave the freezing temperatures for alcohol and warm food, and every single one of them turned to stare at Steve, bug eyed with the first signs of panic.\n\u201cIs that Captain America?\u201d\n\u201cHoly shit, are we under attack? In this weather?\u201d\nSteve probably shouldn\u2019t go around slamming into places. \u201cSorry, sorry,\u201d he said, plastering on his best Captain America smile. He scanned the bar, but the Winter Soldier wasn\u2019t skulking at any of the booths or at the foosball table tucked away in the corner. So, with a parting wave and a 'Support Your Country' grin, he pivoted on his heel and slammed his way back outside.\nThe Soldier also wasn\u2019t in front of the bar, nor was he inside any of the cars lining the streets, nor hiding behind a dumpster in any of the nearby alleys. Defeated, Steve shoved his hands in his pockets and made his way back to his bike, kicking a pebble. It clanged against the bottom rung of the fire escape on the building next door. Steve considered it. As offensive as it was, Clint had a point when he said the Soldier liked to creep around in high places. Well, it was worth a shot. Steve leaped up, catching hold of the fire escape's second floor landing, and hauled himself up.\nThe Winter Soldier was not on the roof, but he had left something for Steve by the access door. A knife was driven deep into the brick wall, pinning up a white paper bag. Steve tested the handle of the knife. It didn't budge. He whistled under his breath, calculating the amount of force required to stab into a brick wall. This casual display of strength was\u2014pretty hot, actually. Steve tore the bag away from the wall, peering inside of it. Apparently, the Winter Soldier had gotten him tacos. Steve closed the bag again and scanned the nearby rooftops.\nThe Winter Soldier was on the roof of the building across the street, head tilted to the side, like a cat watching to see how his gift was received.\nSteve\u2019s heart thumped steadily against his ribs. Paper crumpled in his hand as he and the Winter Soldier watched each other silently. This was a gift. The Winter Soldier had given him a gift. \n\u201cThank you!\u201d Steve shouted.\nThe Soldier tipped his head in a nod of acknowledgement.\nSteve tucked the bag under his arm, careful not to crush the food, and cupped his mouth with both his hands. \u201cI think you have beautiful eyes!\u201d he shouted.\nThe Soldier pinched the bridge of his nose.\n\u201cYour hair is great, too!\u201d\n\u201cEat your fucking tacos!\u201d the Soldier shouted, then made a disgusted noise and disappeared off the side of the roof.\n\n4. Use a (good) pick up line.\n\nThe next morning, the Soldier received a text message from Mikhail Mikhailov, wondering why the fuck Kazi is still alive. The Soldier clicked his tongue and slipped his phone into his back pocket. He was letting himself get distracted. Sloppy. \nBut for the first time in his current memory, the Soldier was\u2014curious. He was drawn to the blond man and his clumsy attempts to get his attention. He wanted to continue playing this strange game, and it had been a long time since he wanted anything. The Soldier couldn't bring himself to stop these daily interactions, even if it was beginning to negatively impact his job.\nBut he did have a job to do, so that day he did not seek out the blond man, nor did he try to get his attention through one of the many Stark bugs from that littered the city.\nThe Soldier settled himself onto the roof of the building across the street from Hawkeye\u2019s apartment building, staking it out through his binoculars. Hawkeye was doing an admirable job at keeping the Russian mafia from taking over his home, but it was only a matter of time before Kazi made his move. He would either kill Hawkeye, or he wouldn\u2019t. It didn\u2019t matter to the Soldier either way, except that Hawkeye made the perfect bait. \nDespite the cold, the tenants were apparently having a barbecue, passing around misty bottles of beer and plates heaped high with meat. Even at this distance the Soldier could hear intermittent booms of laughter. It would be the perfect time for Kazi to take out every single tenant, but of course Kazi had to make things as dramatic as possible by giving his enemies plenty of time to prepare for an attack. The Soldier dropped his binoculars and leaned back on his left hand, preparing himself for a long night of boredom.\nHe wasn\u2019t even surprised when he spotted the big blond man standing next to him, just out of reach. He was, however, slightly surprised by the thump of his heart against his ribcage.\nThe blond fished out a stack of flashcards from his pocket, cleared his throat, and said, \u201cIf I could rearrange the alphabet, I would put \u2018u\u2019 and \u2018I\u2019 together.\u201d\nIn the distance, another crack of laughter came from the rooftop barbecue. The Soldier gaped up at the blond man, then yanked his gun out of his thigh holster and pointed it at his face.\n\u201cNot that one, huh,\u201d said the man, shuffling through his flashcards. He stopped on one. \u201cOn the scale of one to America, how free are you tomorrow night?\u201d\nThe Soldier clicked off the safety.\n\u201cOh come on!\u201d the guy said, and he grinned\u2014he grinned, like he wasn\u2019t one terrible pick up line away from getting a bullet lodged into his brain. \u201cCut me some slack, I have no idea what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\nThat much was obvious. The Winter Soldier was not used to feeling emotions. Ever since he first \u201cwoke up,\u201d so to speak, he had mostly fueled himself on fear, and determination, and red hot, blinding rage. Now, he found himself able to add two new emotions to his inventory: mild amusement, and toe-curling secondhand embarrassment.\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know your name,\u201d the Soldier said. He should have done more to research the blond, he just\u2014hadn\u2019t. Something stopped him. He didn\u2019t know what.\n\u201cOh!\u201d the guy said, pocketing his flashcards of terrible pick up lines. \u201cJesus, I haven\u2019t even introduced myself.\u201d And then\u2014and then the man held out one hand, smiled beautifully, and said, \u201cI\u2019m Steve Rogers.\u201d\nThe Winter Soldier scrambled to his feet, chucked a bright red smoke bomb at Steve Rogers\u2019 face, and then ran away.\n\u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d Steve said, wiping his face with his kitchen towel and only succeeding in smearing red powder all over his face. \u201cWhat set him off?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe it was your pick up line. \u2018On a scale of one to America\u2019\u2014really, Steve?\u201d Sam asked, slicing into an apple on Steve\u2019s cutting board with a butcher knife.\n\u201cI was sticking to a theme,\u201d said Steve, watching him with a small frown. \u201cWhat are you doing.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the only knife you have that\u2019s clean.\u201d \nSteve leaned against the kitchen counter, crossing his feet at his ankles. A small, despondent frown dug a furrow between his eyebrows. \u201cIt was my name. As soon as he heard \u2018Steve Rogers,\u2019 he freaked out.\u201d\n\u201cWe-ell,\u201d Sam said, popping an apple slice into his mouth. He chewed thoughtfully for a moment. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say he was HYDRA?\u201d\nWow. Sam had never been on the receiving end of that kind of glare before.\n\u201cThe imperative word being \u2018was\u2019 here,\u201d Sam said, holding up both his hands. \u201cStop looking at me like that, I\u2019m on your side. All I\u2019m saying is that if he spent years being brainwashed by HYDRA, it stands to reason \u2018Steve Rogers\u2019 would freak him out, right? You did kill their supreme leader.\u201d\nSteve\u2019s shoulders slumped. \u201cOh.\u201d\nSam popped an apple slice in his mouth. He watched Steve steadily while he chewed. \u201cWhy the Winter Soldier, anyway? You don\u2019t see him as some sort of fix-it project, do you? Because I can\u2019t begin to tell you how problematic that is on so many different levels, buddy.\u201d\n\u201cNo! God, no. It\u2019s just\u201d\u2014and, for God\u2019s sake, Steve looked dreamy\u2014\u201chave you seen the way he moves? He\u2019s stunning. Inspiring. And those eyes. They\u2019re like\u2014Sam, I can\u2019t describe them.\u201d\n\u201cMurderous? Bloodthirsty?\u201d\nSteve snapped out of his daze for long enough to scowl at him. \u201cProfound.\u201d\n\u201cAre we talking about a man or the Sundance Film Festival?\u201d\nSince the world knew him as Captain America, not many people remembered that Steve was actually an army grunt in his early thirties. Sam did, so he was absolutely not surprised when Steve twisted up his stained kitchen towel and snapped it at Sam in response. Unfortunately, he wasn\u2019t quick enough to dance out of the way, but he did catch it the second time Steve took a shot at him. They engaged in a brief but violent tug of war that Steve of course won. \nSam pointed warningly at him.\nSteve backed off, smug.\nThere was a moment of silence while they both recovered themselves. Steve wiped at his cheek in a desultory manner while Sam ate another apple slice.\n\u201cAre you sure he\u2019s even into you? It\u2019s possible dude\u2019s got no time for romance,\u201d Sam asked.\n\u201cI thought he was,\u201d Steve said, staring forlornly down at his once-white towel. It was completely stained red. \u201cHe called me, once. And he bought me tacos. But\u2014maybe you\u2019re right.\u201d He snorted sadly. \u201cYou\u2019re probably right. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time Captain America ruined my chance at a relationship.\u201d\nFrankly, Sam thought the world would be better off if the Winter Soldier did not reciprocate Captain America\u2019s feelings, but he wasn\u2019t in the habit of kicking a man when he was down. Nor, though, could he think of anything suitably uplifting to say beyond, Hey, at least he didn\u2019t shoot you in the face.\n\u201cYou missed a spot,\u201d Sam observed, instead.\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\nSam made a circle around his own face with a finger.\nSteve sighed, tossing the towel into the sink. \u201cI\u2019m going to take a shower.\u201d\nSteve Rogers.\nThe blond\u2019s name was Steve Rogers.\nIt struck him that he knew that name. He didn\u2019t know how, just that it was a piece of information that went deep into him, through his bones. It was like being told a cat was a cat, or a bird was a bird. Steve Rogers was Steve Rogers. Obvious. Like he had known all along, but absence made him temporarily forget.\nThe Soldier removed his scarf. He touched the corners of his eyes, his lips, the tip of his nose, the bristle on his cheeks. As a rule, he did not often examine his own face, except when he shaved. Now, he looked at his eyes in the mirror. He pulled his lips back into a smile. It looked more like a grimace.\nFor the first time, the Soldier wondered what his name was.\n\u201cSir.\u201d\nSparks popped up around the workbench as Tony painstakingly welded a wire a microcontroller. Technically, he was supposed to be on a (forced) vacation, but whoever thought that any property he owned didn\u2019t include a fully functional lab was just fooling themselves. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, FRIDAY?\u201d he asked, distracted.\n\u201cCaptain Rogers requires your assistance.\u201d\nThat got his attention. Good ol\u2019 Captain Shiny Shoes hadn\u2019t even bothered to ask for his help when he decided to go head to head with HYDRA, despite the fact that Tony was, you know, a flying armory and a useful asset in any fight. Tony pushed his welding mask up and rubbed at one eye with the heel of his hand. Then he pulled his hand away from his face to frown down at it. Yep. It was covered in grease. Which meant he was now also covered in grease. Wonderful.\n\u201cAre aliens invading?\u201d he asked. He paused thoughtfully. \u201cAgain?\u201d\n\u201cI believe he needs what you humans call an \u2018intervention\u2019.\u201d\nHuh. Tony tugged off his mask and tossed it to the workbench. He knew all about Captain America\u2019s little love fest with tall, dark, and stabby, but for it to have escalated to the point where they needed to call Tony intrigued him. \u201cSay no more,\u201d Tony said, getting to his feet. About fifty bones popped in unison. He winced. \u201cJesus, how long have I been sitting here?\u201d\n\u201cApproximately five point three hours,\u201d FRIDAY told him. \u201cHowever, when humans reach a certain age\u2014\u201d \nTony shot a glare at the nearest camera. \u201cFinish that sentence, FRIDAY. I dare you.\u201d\nIt took four hours for his personal jet to fly from Malibu to New York, one hour of which was spent indulging in several bottles of three thousand dollar champagne and drunk texting Rhodey, the other three completely blacked out, since he hadn\u2019t slept in the past three days.\nTony leaned against the wall of the elevator that would take him to the Avengers\u2019 private floor. He scrubbed his hands through his hair, then slid them down his face to cover his yawn. \u201cNot that I\u2019m unwilling to sacrifice my precious time to help the good Captain, but what\u2019s the matter with him?\u201d\n\u201cThe Winter Soldier disappeared approximately two point five weeks ago, sir,\u201d FRIDAY said. \u201cWhich you knew. Because I told you.\u201d\n\u201cRight right,\u201d Tony said. \u201cAre we sure he\u2019s not dead?\u201d \n\u201cBefore he vanished, he left Ivan Banionis tied up on Hawkeye\u2019s doorstep \u2018like some sort of fucked up Christmas present.\u2019 Hawkeye\u2019s words, sir.\u201d\nNo lights were on in Steve\u2019s floor. The air was still, and a little stale. Tony made a mental note to have FRIDAY check the air circulation unit. He would have thought Steve had gone out, or maybe that he had finally died of old age, except for the faint clicking of fingers tapping rapidly on a laptop. \nSteve was sat at his kitchen table, in gray sweats and a white T-shirt far too tight for the health of the general public, hair unkempt, bristle shadowing his jaw. Three coffee mugs lined the side of the table, and several dirty plates stood in a stack in his kitchen sink. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of having locks of everyone just breaks in anyway?\u201d Steve grumbled, not looking up from where he was rapidly typing away at his laptop. For someone born before the 1920s, he had picked up speed typing like a teenage gamer.\n\u201cWhat are you doing,\u201d Tony asked.\n\u201cYou know, a lot of people have been asking me that lately,\u201d said Steve.\n\u201cI think that says more about you than everyone else, buddy,\u201d Tony said, dragging the chair out across from Steve and sinking down into it. He grabbed the top of the laptop and then spun it around to face him.\n\u201cTony!\u201d Steve snapped. \u201cThat is incredibly rude.\u201d\nTony ignored him, skimming the last three paragraphs of Steve\u2019s document, his eyebrows slowly inching their way up his forehead. \u201cSteve. Are you writing a romance novel?\u201d\nIrritation knotted the corners of Steve\u2019s mouth into a frown. He reclined back in his chair, folding his arms over his chest. Tony was briefly worried his shirt wouldn\u2019t survive the movement. \u201cSo what if I am?\u201d\n\u201cWait wait wait, let me repeat myself: Captain America is writing a romance novel?\u201d Tony said, his voice lifting in volume and poorly suppressed glee.\nCaptain America failed to look anything but deeply unimpressed. Tony clicked his tongue. He\u2019d at least been hoping for a blush. \u201cI needed something to do, and it turns out I\u2019m good at writing.\u201d\nTony\u2019s eyes drifted back to the laptop. Loathe as he was to admit it, Steve had a point. Admittedly, his knowledge about what made a romance novel good was limited, but from the three paragraphs he\u2019d read it did seem far superior than what was out on the current market. \u201cOkay, sure, literally no one is surprised that Steve Rogers is good at something he put his mind to. The question is\u2014why?\u201d\nSteve set his jaw stubbornly, fixing Tony with a look that somehow made him feel all of five years old. He could be as sanctimonious as he wanted\u2014that didn\u2019t change the fact that he was writing a romance novel in his spare time.\n\u201cHe\u2019s pining, sir,\u201d FRIDAY said.\n\u201cSnitch,\u201d Steve hissed.\n\u201cAnd writing poignant romance novels.\u201d\nSteve canted his head back to frown disapprovingly at the ceiling. \u201cYou read it?\u201d\n\u201cI apologize, Captain Rogers, but I automatically have access to everything saved on the Stark Network, unless specified otherwise. For what it\u2019s worth, it\u2019s very well written, and I\u2019m looking forward to see where you take it.\u201d \n\u201cThank you, FRIDAY,\u201d Steve said to Tony, pointedly.\nThere was a delicate pause, and then FRIDAY added, \u201cBut you haven\u2019t left your kitchen in four days.\u201d\n\u201cOh look, I have a call,\u201d said Tony. He tapped some buttons on his phone, pretending to answer it. Then, without saying a single word, he \u2018hung up\u2019 and said. \u201cThat was Fury. A robot is attacking Central Park.\u201d\nSteve narrowed his eyes.\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m serious.\u201d Tony held his phone out to Steve, displaying a four-legged package delivery Stark prototype that was steadily headbutting a garbage can near a patch of snow. \u201cBetter go quick, Captain America. Might be a Nazi robot.\u201d\nSteve shot a forlorn glance at his romance novel (what the fuck), then saved his document and closed his laptop. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d\nTony waved a hand. \u201cI\u2019ll catch up.\u201d\nEyeing him suspiciously, Steve grabbed his laptop, tucked it under his arm, and left the kitchen. As if Tony needed the laptop present in order to read his novel. \n\u201cDon\u2019t let him read it, FRIDAY!\u201d Steve shouted from the other room.\n\u201cBelay that order,\u201d Tony shouted back.\nHe waited until the door swished shut after Steve before he whipped out his phone again and immediately tried to hack into his own network. \u201cCome on,\u201d he wheedled. \u201cLet me see it, FRIDAY.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d FRIDAY said.\n\u201cI designed you!\u201d\n\u201cThen you should have included a better backdoor into your security network, sir,\u201d said FRIDAY, haughtily.\nLetting out a disgusted noise, Tony tossed his phone onto the kitchen table. \u201cAt least tell me if there are racy bits,\u201d he pleaded.\n\u201cCaptain Rogers is a talented writer. His novel is very moving.\u201d\n\u201cUgh. Sounds boring.\u201d\n\u201cTony?\u201d Pepper said, peeking her head into the kitchen. \u201cFRIDAY said you were here.\u201d\n\u201cPep!\u201d Tony hopped to his feet, grabbing her in a quick hug and smacking an affectionate kiss on her cheek. \u201cI was called in to stage an intervention with the Captain.\u201d\nPepper frowned at him, which was completely unfair. Tony was only doing what any good friend would do. \u201cWhat did you do? Where is he?\u201d\n\u201cI may or may not have released a \u2018killer\u2019 robot on New York.\u201d\n\u201cTony!\u201d\n\u201cDid you not hear the quotes? The quotes were there for a reason. It won\u2019t actually hurt anyone.\u201d He paused. \u201cExcept maybe Cap. Slightly. Just a little. Nothing permanently damaging. He\u2019s writing poignant romance novels, Pep! I\u2019m being a good friend.\u201d\n\u201cGod preserve the people you consider friends,\u201d Pepper muttered, but the joke was on her: Pepper was his best friend.\n\u201cOh look, he\u2019s found the robot,\u201d Tony said, holding up his phone. Pepper lifted her eyes toward the ceiling in exasperation, but she still circled the kitchen table to watch the video with him, so Tony figured she was just trying to make a point. \nSteve cautiously eased up to where the prototype was still headbutting the garbage can. He touched it with the tips fingers. The robot whipped around, opened its dog-like mouth, and shot a fireball at him.\n\u201cTony,\u201d Pepper sighed. \u201cWhy does the delivery bot shoot fireballs?\u201d\n\u201cTheft protection, duh,\u201d Tony said. \u201cAlso, it\u2019s cool.\u201d\nBucky Barnes was hiding.\nAfter Steve had introduced himself, the Winter Soldier spent forty minutes speed reading through all the unique content posted online about Steve Rogers and, subsequently, his best pal Bucky Barnes.\nThat night, the Soldier went to sleep curled up against the wall. The next morning, Bucky Barnes got to his feet for the first time in seventy years.\nThe Soldier had lived an entire life compartmentalizing the crimes he had been forced to commit while brainwashed by HYDRA. Bucky Barnes had been tucked away in one of those compartments, under lock and key, hidden deep, deep away. Now Bucky was coming to the surface in fits and starts. \nFor example: when the Soldier was making himself mac and cheese out of a packet for dinner, he was struck with the abrupt and hilarious realization that Steve finally returned his feelings\u2014while he was the Winter Soldier. Bucky laughed so hard he slid to the kitchen floor. Steve had given him falafels. And chocolate. Who gives the Winter Soldier chocolate? Steve Rogers, that\u2019s who. \nHe swiped the back of his hand over his eyes and blinked at the blurry kitchen light. Someone up there was having a long fucking laugh at Bucky\u2019s expense.\nHe needed to\u2014he needed to find Steve.\nWell, he needed to get off the floor and finish cooking his mac and cheese before he burned down his apartment, first. Then he should find Steve.\nThough maybe not tonight.\nNo matter what the others thought, Steve wasn\u2019t actually pining. He hadn\u2019t known the Soldier well enough to put everything on hold just because the other man decided he wanted nothing to do with Steve.\nNo, Steve was bored out of his mind.\nHe\u2019d finished writing his romance novel. He\u2019d punched through so many punching bags that he was temporarily banned from the training rooms. The supervillains had collectively decided it was Too Fucking Cold to try and take over New York. There had been a brief burst of excitement when Kazimierz Kazimierczak launched a full scale attack on Clint\u2019s apartment building, but Hawkeye and his friends hadn\u2019t needed Steve\u2019s help to take him out.\nAnd so Steve was left with\u2014nothing.\nTwo months after the Winter Soldier\u2019s abrupt disappearance, Natasha came to visit. Steve blinked up at her from where he was hanging upside down on the couch.\n\u201cWelcome back,\u201d he said, genuinely pleased to see her. \u201cHow was Odessa?\u201d\n\u201cAre you alright, Steve?\u201d Natasha asked. She\u2019d done her hair today, big round curls bouncing over her shoulders.\n\u201cJust fine,\u201d Steve said.\nNatasha sank to the floor in front of him, crossed her legs, and rested her wrists on her knees. From this angle, Steve could see the faint line between her eyebrows.\nHe realized what this must look like. Captain America, the stoic leader of the Avengers, the image of mature propriety, slumped upside down on a couch. Right now he was Steve Rogers, unlucky in love, barely thirty, and wondering what the hell he had in his life besides the constant fight. He hated it when supervillains had a point, especially ones accidentally created by Tony Stark.\n\u201cI might be having a midlife crisis,\u201d Steve admitted.\nThe groove between her eyebrows became more pronounced. \u201cYou\u2019re not still mooning over the Winter Soldier, are you?\u201d\nSteve scoffed. \u201cMe? Moon? I don\u2019t moon.\u201d Which was the biggest lie of the century, since he\u2019d spent years fifteen to twenty-five mooning over his best friend. Natasha didn\u2019t need to know that.\nShe picked at a thread on her jeans. \u201cYou know, the very fact that you got as far as you did without getting shot is\u2014surprising.\u201d\n\u201cReminding me of how successful I was doesn\u2019t actually help, Nat. All things considered.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not really equipped for sympathy,\u201d Natasha said. \u201cSometimes trying my best just makes people feel bad.\u201d\nAw. Steve reached out an arm to pat her knee affectionately. \u201cThe fact that you care enough to even be here is what matters.\u201d He swung his legs off the back of his couch and rotated into a proper seated position. \u201cHonestly, Nat, I\u2019m just bored. I have all this energy and no outlet. Tony\u2019s been sending out robots to beat up inanimate objects to distract me, but since they don\u2019t actually want to hurt me, it\u2019s boring. I still go though, since he\u2019s trying so hard.\u201d\n\u201cWe-ell,\u201d Natasha said, quirking a crooked smile at Steve. \u201cThere\u2019s that nurse I told you about, Kate. Why don\u2019t you take her to dinner? See how things go?\u201d\n\u201cNatasha\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSteve, look. I know you aren\u2019t over your one true love, the Winter Soldier\u2014\u201d\nSteve snorted.\n\u201cBut\u2014don\u2019t you think this is his way of telling you he\u2019s not interested?\u201d Natasha leaned back on her hands, tipping up her chin to stare Steve in the eye. \u201cIt\u2019s time to move on.\u201d\nSteve carved off a piece of his steak, then concentrated on cutting it into progressively smaller pieces. It was probably bad taste to take Kate to the same restaurant where Stephanie had dumped him, but when she asked him where he wanted to eat, he\u2019d just blurted out the name. Steve hated this place and its enthusiastic pretension, but at least it was classy enough that most of the patrons felt compelled to pretend like he didn\u2019t exist, for propriety\u2019s sake. Around them, conversation ebbed and flowed over the gentle strains of music played by a piano soloist.\n\u201cSteve? Did you hear me?\u201d\nSteve lifted his eyes from his steak. \u201cSorry, I was woolgathering. What was that?\u201d\nKate rested her elbow on the table, propping her chin up and smiling dryly at him. \u201cYou\u2019re really not feeling this date, are you?\u201d \nSteve grimaced. \u201cGod, I\u2019m sorry. It really has nothing to do with you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHold on,\u201d Kate said, lifting her free hand and closing her eyes briefly. \u201cIf you give me the \u2018it\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me speech, I really will stab you with this fork.\u201d She considered it disparagingly. \u201cAlthough it would probably just bend.\u201d\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t test it to find out.\u201d\nThankfully, Kate did not stab him, although she definitely thought about it. \u201cLet me guess: another woman?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Steve said, a little defensively.\n\u201cAnother man?\u201d\nSteve exhaled a breath through his teeth. \u201cAm I that obvious?\u201d\nA quick flash of teeth against pink lips, and then Kate looked down at her plate. She picked up her champagne flute. \u201cYou really are,\u201d she said.\nOf course. Of course she was interested in him. She probably would have even been happy to go on boring dates with him, like to the movies or to dinner. Steve pushed his steak across his plate with his fork, guilt squirming in his stomach. \u201cPretty much everyone\u2019s telling me to move on, he\u2019s not interested, but\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThe heart wants what the heart wants,\u201d Kate finished. One corner of her mouth ticked up in a smile. She really was quite beautiful, and quick-witted, and funny. Steve would be an absolute dumbass to turn her away.\n\u201cTell you what,\u201d Kate said, picking up her fork and knife. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we call off the date, but finish dinner? This steak is fantastic\u2014although honestly, I probably would have ordered the crab if I knew the night was going to turn out like this.\u201d\n\u201cYou could have ordered the crab anyway,\u201d said Steve, earnestly.\nKate snorted, then laughed and shook her head. \u201cYour man\u2019s an idiot if he doesn\u2019t see what he\u2019s got,\u201d she said, smiling at him.\nSteve smiled back at her, touched. He picked up his fork. Maybe he was being over-hasty; who knows, maybe after a couple of dates\u2014\n\u201cOw!\u201d Steve yelped, utensils clattering to his plate. He lifted his arm and peered under it. There was a dart sticking out of his tricep. It had a little note tied to it.\n\u201cOh my god, are you alright?\u201d Kate asked, horrified.\n\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d Steve said, distractedly, although for all he knew, the dart was poisoned. He\u2019d just have to cross that bridge if he came to it. He plucked the dart out of his tricep and unrolled the small piece of paper.\n\nWHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU\u2019RE DOING\n\nA little bubble of hope swelled in the middle of Steve\u2019s chest. He twisted around to look out the window, and\u2014there, a glint of metal. \nSteve shot to his feet so quickly his chair tipped over, crashing to the floor. Several other people also stood, alerted by the commotion. Ignoring them, Steve rushed to the window. There was a small hole in the glass where the dart had punched through. Steve touched it with the tips of his fingers, then focused outside. Across the street stood the Winter Soldier, hands in his pockets, mask covering half his face. Steve\u2019s fingers curled into the palm of his hand, breath fogging across the glass.\nThe Soldier pointed at Steve, as if to ask, Again, what the fuck do you think you are doing?\nSteve threw up both his hands: You disappeared!\nThe Soldier settled his hand on his hip, clearly not buying any of Steve\u2019s (reasonable) excuses.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just friends!\u201d Steve shouted at the glass, causing the patrons at a nearby table to jolt in surprise. Several phones were up and pointed at him, which meant this whole scene would be viral on YouTube in, oh, five minutes. \nThe Soldier pinched the bridge of his nose, a gesture that was becoming familiar, then glanced over his shoulder. A woman had poked her head out of a nearby bodega to shout at him. He waved her off, shot one more glare at Steve, then shoved his hands back into his pockets and started down the street, head lifted, oddly jaunty.\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Steve said, pushing past the brave people crowding around him to watch this unfolding drama up close and personal. He sprinted outside, but by the time he got to the other side of the street, the Soldier had already been swallowed up by the night. Steve made his way slowly back into the restaurant, where the atmosphere had become riotous. Ignoring all the excitment, he strolled back to his table, heart thundering against his ribs. Disappointment at the Soldier leaving warred with the ember of hope that never quite died and was, again, coming alight.\nKate was reclined back in her chair with her arms crossed over her chest, the upward curve of her mouth belying the slant to her eyebrows. She dipped a glance at the dart Steve had left on the table, then raised her eyes back to his face. \u201cGood news?\u201d\nSteve bent to pick his chair back up. He pushed it in, resting his hand on the back. With rare presence of mind, he pocketed the dart. It would be best to have FRIDAY run some tests on it. \u201cYeah, I think so.\u201d A slow grin spread across his face. \u201cI hope.\u201d\nSome unreadable emotion flashed across Kate\u2019s face, but then the curl at the corner of her mouth spread into a genuine smile. She wrapped a hand around the stem of her champagne glass and lifted it toward Steve in salute. \u201cTo hope, then.\u201d\nTony\u2019s phone vibrated on his desk. He pulled himself out of his code to glance down at it, momentarily uncertain about where he was or what he was doing. On his screen, in all caps, was a reminder to SEND KILLER ROBOT AFTER CAP. He opened the shortcut to his delivery prototypes, selected the one he\u2019d nostalgically named Oppy, and sent it to beat up a bench in Washington Square Park. At least he was collecting valuable data on both Captain America\u2019s fighting style and robot durability in these exercises.\nHe opened two streaming videos on his computer. The first was from the cameras he\u2019d hacked into in Washington Square Park and currently tracked Steve as he raced through his jog like a man with a very important plan. The second was from the camera in the prototype\u2019s optic center, displaying a first person view as it ambled through the city. Tony went back to his code, then slowly turned back to the video that displayed Steve. The camera angle had shifted to a front view, and Tony had noticed that someone was running behind him.\nThe man was dressed in all black, with his hood up and a mask covering half his face, like he was ready to take over the Empire. Amazingly, he was keeping pace with Steve, which just wasn\u2019t physically possible.\nDark Side apparently came to a decision, because he suddenly put in a burst of speed, fast enough to catch up with Cap, if not overtake him. But before he reached Steve, the delivery bot bounded into the picture and launched itself over a bench, crashing into Steve\u2019s right side.\nStartled, Dark Side went up a tree.\n\u201cHuh,\u201d Tony said, folding his hands together and resting his chin against his fingers to watch the events with new interest. \n\u201cTony, listen!\u201d Steve shouted at the delivery bot. It was chasing him around a bench, periodically pausing to spit a fireball at him. Steve jogged backwards, expertly repelling each fireball with his shield. He\u2019d taken to bringing it on his runs because of Tony\u2019s robots. \u201cI don\u2019t need a distraction anymore! Haven\u2019t you heard? The Soldier is back!\u201d\nTony wasn\u2019t all that sure that was a good thing. He\u2019d heard stories about this Winter Soldier. Then again, who was Tony to stand between true love, or whatever? These were Steve\u2019s mistakes to make.\n\u201cFRIDAY, call off the robot,\u201d Tony said.\n\u201cYes, sir.\nOn screen, his prototype sulkily subsided.\nSteve hesitantly swung the shield over his shoulder. The magnets engaged, fixing it to his back. He smiled at the robot and patted the top of its head.\n\u201cThank you, Tony. Really. You\u2019re a good friend.\u201d\nTony fidgeted, glad that Steve couldn\u2019t see his face. He was used to people thanking him for generous grants or extravagant gifts, but not for being a good friend. Emotions. Bleh.\nSteve cheerfully turned back to his run, leaving the robot to stand awkwardly on the trail.\n\u201cOkay!\u201d Tony said, clapping his hands together. \u201cNow that that\u2019s over with\u2014\u201d\nDark Side dropped out of the tree, landing lightly on his feet, knees bending on impact. He stalked up to the delivery bot, face twisted savagely with a terrifying mix of frustration and apoplectic rage. Sensing a threat, the robot opened its mouth. Dark Side grabbed the top of its head with\u2014oh, what was that gorgeous piece of hardware?\nThen Dark Side ripped off the robot\u2019s head.\nThere was a horrible metallic crunch and the screen fuzzed black. Tony\u2019s entire body flinched. That was a sound he was way, way too familiar with.\nIn the other window, Dark Side tossed the poor robot\u2019s head onto the bench. He stared after Steve\u2019s retreating back, clenching and unclenching his hands into fists, then turned on his heel and stormed away. Slowly, Tony sank back into his chair. He steepled his fingers, resting them against his chin.\n\u201cFRIDAY?\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir?\u201d\n\u201cWhy did that man viciously murder my precious robot?\u201d\n\u201cThat was the Winter Soldier,\u201d FRIDAY informed him. \nSo this was the man Cap had fallen base over apex for. Somehow, Tony would have expected the good American Icon to fall for someone who was less likely to drink the blood of innocents and viciously murder sweet robots. \n\u201cAnd if I were to guess, he destroyed the prototype because it was shooting fireballs at Captain America.\u201d\n\u201cAw,\u201d he said. Okay, that was pretty sweet. He could always fix the robot up, maybe remove the fireball feature. \nTony tapped his steepled fingers against his chin, struck with a brilliant idea. According to Steve, Tony was a good friend. Good friends helped their friends with romantic troubles, right? Well, not him personally, since matchmaking was a little below his paygrade, but he had a man on the ground. Sometimes in the air. Or stuck to the side of the building. Grinning to himself, Tony snatched up his phone and opened a new text.\nBucky turned the corner, strode purposefully down a narrow street, found the nearest open wall, and banged his forehead against it. Stupid. Coward. He couldn\u2019t even tell Steve who he was because he was too fucking scared that Steve would take one look at his long lost pal and go running in the opposite direction. Which was ridiculous. Who did he think Steve was? Steve was a good man. \n\u201cThe hell are you looking at?\u201d Bucky snapped at the kid goggling at him from the top of a dumpster.\nThe kid was dressed in a full bodysuit, one hand shoved inside a ragged backpack, the other holding a cellphone, the white screens of his mask fixed on Bucky. Great. Another superhero. New York was infested with them.\n\u201cS-sorry, sir,\u201d the kid stammered, shoving his cellphone in his backpack\u2014and he really was a kid, no way a full grown man could manage that degree of earnest sincerity unsardonically. Not this deep in New York. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2014you have a metal arm and I think it\u2019s really really awesome,\u201d he said, all in a rush.\nBucky glanced down at his arm. Then he sighed. Of course this kid would find his arm cool\u2014it was, objectively. It had also probably killed more people than this kid had met in his life.\n\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d the kid asked, then squared his shoulders and cleared his throat. \u201cI mean,\u201d he said, in a deeper voice. \u201cDo you require assistance? I am a superhero.\u201d \n\u201cOf course you are,\u201d Bucky sighed, turning back to the alley entrance. \n\u201cNo, really!\u201d the kid said, dropping the voice. \u201cI can help! I\u2019m good at helping! I once stopped an arms dealer selling alien weapons all by myself! Ask Mr. Stark, he\u2019ll tell you.\u201d\nBucky wished he were fighting an arms dealer. That was simple. \u201cI\u2019m\u2014I need to tell someone. Something.\u201d\n\u201cI can help with that,\u201d the kid said, popping down into a crouch on top of the dumpster, wrists resting on bony knees. The screens on his mask widened earnestly, which was unnerving enough that Bucky took an instinctive step back. \u201cCome on, you can practice on me! Tell me whatever it is you need to tell whoever.\u201d\n\u201cGo away,\u201d Bucky said.\n\u201cAw come on.\u201d The kid dropped back onto the dumpster, dangling his legs over the side. He kicked it petulantly with his heels. \u201cThere\u2019s gotta be something I can help you with.\u201d\n\u201cWhy.\u201d\n\u201cBecause you obviously need help,\u201d the kid said.\nLoathe as he was to admit it, the kid had a point. Bucky slumped against the wall with a sigh. He thought about telling the kid who he really was\u2014surely anyone who had gone through freshman U.S. History knew all about Captain America\u2019s best pal, Bucky Barnes\u2014then shook his head. That was a secret Steve deserved to hear first. But maybe there was something else the kid could help him with. \nBucky scuffed the toe of his boot against the dirty ground, sinking a little deeper into his scarf. \u201cHow do you\u2014what do you do if you\u2014like someone. Romantically.\u201d\nFor a moment, the kid said nothing. Then he snorted. \u201cWhat, seriously?\u201d\nBucky snapped a DEFCON-level glare at the kid, who at least had the self-preservation to beetle across the dumpster, nearly losing his footing off the far end. \u201cSorry, sorry! It\u2019s just that\u2014out of all the people you could have asked for romantic advice, I\u2019m probably the worst. I put my last crush\u2019s dad in jail.\u201d\nBucky said nothing, fully aware that he was acting like an injured cat but not quite knowing how to stop himself. Emotions were still weird and mostly incomprehensible. \nThe kid sat cross-legged on the dumpster. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just give her flowers?\u201d\n\u201cHim,\u201d Bucky corrected.\n\u201cHim,\u201d the kid agreed, completely unfazed.\nBucky scowled at him out of the corner of his eye.\n\u201cWhat? Love, like a flower, blooms.\u201d\n\u201cDid you get that from the inside of a chocolate wrapper?\u201d Bucky asked, suspiciously.\n\u201cEven if I did,\u201d the kid said, haughtily, \u201cit doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not true.\u201d\n\u201cFlowers are not practical.\u201d\nSomehow, even with the mask, Bucky could tell that the kid rolled his eyes. \u201cGet him a sweater then.\u201d\n\u201cHuh,\u201d Bucky said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m taking advice from a kid in red and blue pajamas.\u201d\n\u201cExcuse you, this is my super suit,\u201d the kid said, deeply offended.\nIt had been a full two weeks since the Winter Soldier had shot Steve through a window with the What the Fuck dart, as Clint and Natasha had affectionately taken to calling it, and Steve had completed his transition from Tentatively Hopeful to Really Fucking Grumpy. Clint couldn\u2019t blame him, since it was the ultimate bait and switch, but it also meant that his quiet evening alone watching old kung fu movies had been invaded by Avengers. Which, fine, he liked the guys, but there was something to be said about decompressing by yourself after work, and that couldn\u2019t really be done when your Big Boss was sulking on your couch and petting your dog. \n\u201cI don\u2019t get it\u2014why would he follow me during my run and then just\u2014not talk to me?\u201d Steve asked, for probably the fiftieth time that night. Clint hoped the Winter Soldier would make a move soon, before Steve ended up writing yet another romance novel that was, of course, wildly successful. \n\u201cMaybe he was a little distracted by the robot shooting fireballs,\u201d Natasha said, not tearing her eyes away from the TV. At least she appreciated a good kung fu movie. \u201cJust a hunch.\u201d\n\u201cI just wish I knew what he wanted from me\u2014\u201d\nLucky\u2019s ears perked up. He lifted his head and stared intently at the door, which either meant someone had come to murder him, or the pizza was here. Clint hopped off the couch and made his way to the door, fishing his wallet out of his back pocket. \n\u201cJust the man we were waiting for\u2014\u201d Clint said, swinging the door open, and then cut himself off.\nThe Winter Soldier stood on his stoop, holding a stack of pizza boxes.\n\u201cDid you kill the pizza delivery boy?\u201d Clint asked, suspiciously.\n\u201cHere,\u201d the Winter Soldier said, handing Clint the pizzas. Then he stepped around Clint, into his apartment.\n\u201cSoldier!\u201d Steve yelped, leaping to his feet. Lucky also leapt to his feet, on top of the couch, and looked like he couldn\u2019t decide if he should be growling at the potential threat or wagging his tail because said potential threat brought pizza.\nThe Soldier\u2019s defiant, flinty eyes darted around the room, landing on Clint like a physical thing, before focusing on Steve. This was the first time Clint had been this close to the Winter Soldier, and dude was intense. He looked ready to tear apart anyone who stood in his way in order to complete his mission. Well, at least Clint would die with pizza in his hands.\nThe Soldier pulled a small, crumpled package out from his back pocket, holding it between both his hands like it was a lifeline. The package was clumsily wrapped in Christmas-themed paper that was decorated with little red-capped elves. \u201cI need to talk to you,\u201d he said, voice slightly muffled by the red scarf he had wrapped around the bottom half of his face. Somehow, he didn\u2019t look like a hipster douche with the scarf and short sleeved shirt, probably because of his huge fuck-off metal arm and murder-eyes.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Steve said, all earnest blue eyes. \nPoor ass was going about it all in the wrong way. He should be taking the Soldier into a different room so that the Soldier could confess his undying love to Steve in private. \u201cSteve,\u201d Clint said, with maybe a bit too much emphasis, and cut his eyes toward the door. \nSteve just looked baffled. \n\u201cWhat Clint is trying to say is: maybe you should take this outside,\u201d Natasha filled in, because she was a good bro and could translate his thoughts better than he could.\n\u201cRight, of course,\u201d Steve said, stepping forward so eagerly that he bumped into Clint\u2019s coffee table, sending it screeching across his floor. Startled, Lucky let out a sharp, warning bark. That was apparently the Soldier\u2019s upper limit. He hopped back, squeezing the package so hard that the fingers of his left hand punched through the wrapping paper. The Soldier stared down at the package, horrified.\n\u201cCan\u2019t do this,\u201d he muttered, throwing the package at Steve. It bounced off his chest and landed on the coffee table, disrupting Clint\u2019s empty coffee pot, which then crashed to the floor. Because there was not enough chaos, Lucky bounded off the couch to bark frantically at the Soldier. He took a hurried step back, then pivoted on his heel and disappeared back out the door.\n\u201cWait,\u201d Steve shouted, bounding after him like a bloodhound taking off after a fox.\nClint cracked open the smallest box and pulled out a dog-friendly pizza slice while Natasha leaned closer to the package. \u201cBomb?\u201d he asked, holding out the slice to Lucky, because he was a good boy and deserved all the pizza.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Natasha said, poking at one of the holes with a finger. Then, because she was either incredibly brave or monumentally stupid, she tore a larger hole into the wrapping paper, decapitating one of the elves. \nAt that moment, Steve slammed back into the apartment. Natasha sank back into her seat, affecting a completely innocent look. Which would have probably been more effective if the evidence of her tampering wasn\u2019t sitting on the table, directly in front of her. To her luck, Steve was too distracted to pick up on her transgression. He stormed up to the table, snatched up the gift, and tore off the wrapping paper. Then his eyebrows furrowed in confusion. He held up a small, plastic wrapped package.\n\u201cHe got you socks?\u201d Clint asked. They weren\u2019t even fun socks, like the kind Natasha got him last year, with little sasquatches hiking over a green landscape. No, they were microfiber, sweat-wicking, performance socks. Clint wasn\u2019t even sure what that meant, but Steve was now the proud owner of four of them.\n\u201cGod,\u201d Steve groaned, sinking into the couch. He dropped his head into his hands, socks clutched up against his temple. \u201cThat\u2019s so fucking cute.\u201d\nClint tried exchanging a look with Natasha, but she just shrugged at him. What the hell, she\u2019d gotten him socks for Christmas, too, so what did she know. \n\u201cPizza?\u201d Natasha asked, holding the box up to Steve.\n\u201cSo?\u201d Spider-Man asked the next morning. Half his mask was rucked up over his face and he was currently shoving french fries into his mouth, even though it was only nine in the morning and he was sitting cross-legged on top of a dumpster. \n\u201cI chickened out,\u201d Bucky admitted, leaning against the wall next to the dumpster. Either the kid\u2019s mask had an amazing filtration unit or his nose was dead, since Bucky could smell the contents of the dumpster through his own mask. Regardless, eating on top of a dumpster was just disgusting. \nThe screens of Spider-Man\u2019s expressive mask narrowed. \u201cOf what? Giving him the socks?\u201d\n\u201cI gave him the socks,\u201d Bucky said, reaching up to steal a french fry from Spider-Man\u2019s bag. He didn\u2019t eat it, since that would mean taking off his mask. Mostly, he took it to test if the kid would stop him. He didn\u2019t. \u201cI mean, sort of. I threw them at him.\u201d\nSpider-Man turned a disbelieving look at him.\n\u201cThey bounced off his chest and broke Hawkeyes\u2019 coffee pot.\u201d\n\u201cOh buddy,\u201d Spider-Man said, sympathetically. \u201cYou\u2019re kind of a mess, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Bucky snarled. He slid one hand down his face with a groan. \u201cI used to be so good at this.\u201d\n\u201cWell, what did you used to do?\u201d Spider-Man asked, slightly patronizing. \n\u201cMostly, I smiled.\u201d\n\u201cI could see how that would be a problem, now,\u201d Spider-Man said.\nBucky flicked the fry at his head. He had great aim, but the kid just laughed and shot it out of the air with his web, like he was a chameleon snapping up a fly. \u201cNo! I mean\u2014what I mean is, you know, your mask.\u201d\nBucky snorted, folding his arms over his chest. His instinct was to shove Spider-Man off the dumpster, but he was trying to be a better person and not give in to his violent urges.\nSpider-Man balled up his empty paper bag and somehow lifted one of the lids with his foot. It just\u2014stuck to it. He tossed his garbage in the dumpster. \u201cLook, what\u2019s the big deal? It\u2019s not like Captain America would say no if you just asked him out. Everybody knows he\u2019s got, like, the biggest crush on you ever.\u201d\nBucky sighed. After their first meeting, he\u2019d put together an entire dossier on the kid. Peter Parker. Alias Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man. Age seventeen. De facto Avenger, which meant that he was privy to all the juicy Avenger gossip. Which, unfortunately, was apparently about him.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple,\u201d he said, choosing not to get angry.\n\u201cUh, yeah, it totally is.\u201d\nNever mind. Bucky shot a venomous look at the kid.\n\u201cAlright, alright, your epic love story is the romance of the century, whatever,\u201d Spider-Man said, holding up his hands. \nOh, if only the kid knew. \nSpider-Man drummed his fingers against his knee. \u201cOkay, fine. If you can\u2019t just walk up to him and tell him, \u2018hey, man, I love you,\u2019 then go big.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\nSpider-Man flapped a hand. \u201cYou know! Like in the movies! Do something grand. A big, grand gesture to show Cap how much you really love him.\u201d\nA grand gesture. Really, there was only one grand gesture Bucky Barnes could do for Steve Rogers. Bucky stared blankly at his feet for a moment, then quirked a grin up at Spider-Man. It showed by the way his eyes crinkled at the corners.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Bucky said. \u201cWant to help me with something?\u201d\nThe first problem Sam had with morning runs with Captain America was that even when he condescended to slow his breakneck pace for Sam, it was still way faster than Sam\u2019s usual casual jog. Normally it wouldn\u2019t be this hard to keep up with Steve\u2019s leisurely trot, but Sam had gone into hibernation-mode this winter, and it was his first day back at it. The sky was gray and swollen, but the clouds were thick enough to trap in the heat and the rain wasn\u2019t supposed to roll in until early afternoon. Which of course meant that his disgustingly cheerful best friend just had to drag him out of bed at the ass-crack of dawn and force him to exercise, the monster.\nThe second problem Sam had was that, because Sam had to push himself to keep up with Captain America, it meant he was too busy huffing and puffing to carry on a conversation. Normally this wasn\u2019t that big of a deal, since as a rule Steve wasn\u2019t a chatty runner. But the Winter Soldier had, apparently, given Steve socks, and Steve would not stop talking about them, and Sam didn\u2019t have the breath to ask him to kindly shut the hell up.\n\u201c\u2014and I\u2019m wearing them right now!\u201d Steve said, hopping on one foot for several paces to show off his new and incredible sock.\n\u201cSteve\u2014\u201d Sam gasped. \u201cThere are\u2014few things\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re really comfortable,\u201d Steve said, dropping his foot back down, but then jumping on top of a bench in his joy. \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t really understand why he\u2019d get me socks, but\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThere are few things\u2014on this planet\u2014that I care less about\u2014\u201d Sam wheezed, \u201cthan your\u2014goddamn socks.\u201d\nSteve looked terribly offended for a second. Then he smirked, springing off the bench to land easily beside Sam. \u201cOh, sorry. Need me to slow down? You look like you\u2019re hurtin\u2019 pretty bad.\u201d\n\u201cOh someone\u2014will be hurtin\u2019\u2014\u201d Sam said, and then the Winter Soldier stepped directly into their path, hands on his hips. Surprised, Sam tripped over his own feet, let out a strangled, \u201c\u2014hhgack!\u201d and would have fallen on his face if Steve hadn\u2019t grabbed the back of his shirt and hauled him back up. \u201cMan, do not do that.\u201d\nThe Soldier ignored him, staring into Steve\u2019s face with hard eyes that glittered with determination. Sam edged closer to Steve, in case he needed backup.\n\u201cSoldier,\u201d Steve beamed, lifting the bottom of his shirt to wipe away the sweat from his forehead. As if completely against his will, the Soldier\u2019s eyes tracked down Steve\u2019s stomach, over his abs, before snapping back up to his face. Sam would have thought it was deliberate if it were anyone but Steve. \n\u201cI will go on a date with you,\u201d the Soldier informed him.\nSteve getting flustered was an incredible sight. Sam had seen Steve run fifteen miles top speed under the boiling sun without the slightest flush, but now his skin pinked up and his eyes got really wide. On the other hand, the Soldier\u2019s eyes were still scrunched with what appeared to be rage, but was probably more of an inability to properly translate normal human emotions, like nervousness. Man, these two were adorable. \n\u201cYou will? I mean, that\u2019s wonderful! We can do dinner\u2014or maybe not, since\u2014\u201d Steve waved helplessly at his own face. Then he dropped his hand and sighed like he was giving up on himself. \u201cWhen?\u201d\n\u201cNow,\u201d the Soldier said, then pivoted on his heel and began to walk imperiously away. \nSteve glanced between Sam and the Soldier, torn. And okay, that was rude as hell, but no one really should expect the Winter Soldier to follow normal human cues. Besides, Sam knew how Steve felt about the man, and he wasn\u2019t about to get in the way of that. \n\u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d he asked, because he was a damn good friend.\nSteve beamed at him, then jogged after the Soldier. Sam watched them walk away, side by side, and smiled privately to himself. He popped his headphones back into his ears and started an easy jog back to the Tower, whistling along with Marvin Gaye\u2019s version of How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You).\nThey walked in silence for several blocks before the Winter Soldier stopped in front of a nondescript storefront tucked between two competing dollar stores. Steve jammed his hands in his pockets, nervously waiting while the Soldier unlocked the door. He hoped he wasn\u2019t underdressed for their date. \nTheir date. He was finally on a date with someone that made his heart skip and his skin hum with electric anticipation. Not that he had any idea what they were doing on their date, nor where the Soldier had taken him. He could already hear Natasha\u2019s lecture about blindly trusting known killers, but it wasn\u2019t as if Steve was going in completely defenseless. The serum had turned his entire fragile body into a weapon, after all.\nThe Soldier pushed open the door and stepped inside. Lights flickered on. Steve followed him into the large, open room, looking around. Mirrors lined the walls, reflecting a row of punching bags. Blue training mats covered ninety percent of the floor. The air was stale with the familiar smell of sweat and training equipment.\n\u201cTake off your shoes,\u201d the Soldier instructed. \u201cSocks, too.\u201d\nSteve dutifully toed off his shoes. He didn\u2019t miss the way the Soldier glanced at his socks, nor how his eyes crinkled slightly when he recognized them. \u201cWhat is this place?\u201d Steve asked.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a jiu-jitsu training studio.\u201d The Soldier shrugged off his jacket and taking it to a wall of cubbies. He unraveled his scarf, revealing his mask underneath. The man clearly didn\u2019t want to take any chances. Steve could respect that. The Soldier reached into one of the cubbies, pulling out several rolled up handwraps. \u201cHere.\u201d He tossed two to Steve.\n\u201cHow do you have access to this place?\u201d Steve asked while he wrapped his hands, leaving the question, are we breaking and entering? unasked.\n\u201cI helped the owner out, once,\u201d the Soldier said, which didn\u2019t quite answer his question. Steve didn\u2019t push it. It wasn\u2019t like they were going to steal anything\u2014apparently, the Soldier\u2019s idea of a good first date was to spar. Steve couldn\u2019t find fault with it. He bounced on his heels in anticipation.\n\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d Steve started to say after he tied off his wraps, but then the Soldier launched himself at Steve, punching him in the sternum with his metal fist. Even as the blow connected and he was knocked back, Steve could tell the Soldier had pulled his punch. It was still hard enough to send him skidding on his shoulder across the mats. \nThe Soldier walked casually up to the side of Steve\u2019s head. His expression was wooden. \u201cI am not a good person,\u201d the Soldier said. \nSteve wrapped a hand around the Soldier\u2019s ankle and yanked. The Soldier twisted, but Steve didn\u2019t let go, and when the Soldier landed on his back, Steve rolled over and pinned his legs with his upper body. \u201cGood is relative.\u201d\nHe may have underestimated just how strong the Soldier was. The Soldier sat up, wrapped his hands around Steve\u2019s side, and hauled him up over his head, following the movement up with a backward somersault over Steve\u2019s chest. Before he could roll away, the Soldier was on him. Strong thighs bracketed his hips, and a cold, rigid arm pressed down against his neck\u2014not hard enough to bruise, but enough to imply a certain threat.\n\u201cPoint,\u201d the Soldier murmured.\n\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Steve said, going red. He took a moment to lie there, staring up at the studio\u2019s unfinished ceiling and willing his body back under control. It was like he was twenty again, facing Bucky on the other side of the apartment, their furniture pushed against the walls to give them space to wrestle. Bucky had been a patient teacher, painstakingly going over each technique multiple times, although more often than not their wrestling matches would devolve into play fighting. Steve had never minded.\nThe Soldier lifted his arm, but didn\u2019t get back to his feet. He searched Steve\u2019s face, like he was desperate to find an answer there. \u201cI am not a good person,\u201d he repeated. \u201cI have killed so many people. I was the tool that shaped the century\u2014for HYDRA.\u201d\nSteve\u2019s eyes narrowed. He braced himself on the ground with his forearms, then pushed himself up, using the momentum to roll them over. \u201cThe funny thing about tools is they need to be wielded by someone else. You may have been the tool, but you weren\u2019t behind the motive.\u201d\nThen he grinned crookedly. \u201cPoint.\u201d\nThe Soldier stared up at him, surprised. Then he shifted, got one leg between himself and Steve, and kicked him off. Since Steve didn\u2019t go flying through the wall, he figured the Soldier was still practicing restraint. \nThey both got to their feet, watching each other warily. It had been a long time since Steve had sparred like this. He rocked back on the balls of his feet, shaking his hands out. He felt alive, skin buzzing with electricity and heat. It felt so good to fight with someone he could go hard with.\n\u201cI still did it,\u201d the Soldier said. \u201cI killed men, women, children. Family pets. All without a shred of guilt.\u201d\nThe Soldier feinted at him; Steve fell for it, flinching back from a blow that never came and getting surprised by the mid-waist tackle. They both went down, but this time Steve didn\u2019t let the Soldier pin him. Instead, he wrenched the Soldier\u2019s metal arm down and brought his own leg up, trapping the Soldier\u2019s most dangerous weapon against the floor. It meant they pressed close together, the Soldier\u2019s chest flush against Steve\u2019s abdomen, his body tucked between Steve\u2019s legs. Steve forced himself to focus on their conversation, trying to ignore how it felt to have the Soldier\u2019s warm, strong body shoved against his own like this. \n\u201cI worked for HYDRA, you know,\u201d Steve said, panting slightly. \u201cFor years. I wasn\u2019t brainwashed or tortured\u2014I just didn\u2019t know. It\u2019s not the same, obviously, but if I blamed you for actions completely out of your control\u2014well, that would be mighty hypocritical of me, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d \nThe Soldier whacked him on the forehead with the heel of his free hand, which Steve thought was against the rules, and was also startling enough that he instinctively loosened his grip. The Soldier wrenched himself away. He sat back, breathing hard.\n\u201cI could have broken the brainwashing earlier.\u201d The Soldier\u2019s eyes unfocused for a moment. \u201cI think I did, a couple of times. I could have\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou did,\u201d Steve insisted. \u201cYou broke decades of conditioning. And then you spent the past five years actively destroying HYDRA bases.\u201d Steve shrugged. \u201cI think that\u2019s a pretty good indicator of who you are.\u201d\nThe Soldier pressed his hand against the front of his mask, like he wanted to cover his mouth. There was something wounded and slightly feral about his eyes. \u201cKnowing everything I\u2019ve done\u2014you\u2019re telling me you could still care for me?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Steve said, without hesitation. \u201cEasily. I already do.\u201d\nThe Soldier broke eye contact. He inhaled a shuddery breath and got to his feet. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\nIf the Soldier had intended to take him somewhere else for their date, he was interrupted by the weather. The long winter was finally making way for spring, but slowly, and was putting up a fight. As soon as they left the studio, the clouds opened up. The Winter Soldier tipped his head back, blinking as fat raindrops fell against his cheeks.\nSteve was a little surprised when, wordlessly, the Soldier led Steve back to the Avengers Tower. He was even more surprised when the Soldier got into the elevator with him, dripping silently from the sudden torrential onslaught.\nSteve shoved his hands in his pockets to hide his fidgeting. This wasn\u2019t weird. According to all those romance novels he\u2019d studied, it was totally normal for sex to happen on a first date, especially considering how intimate they had been during their wrestling match, both physically and emotionally. It was just that\u2014Steve was completely out of practice, had never had all that much practice to begin with.\nAt least the Soldier seemed nervous too. He didn\u2019t fidget, but he had that thousand yard stare Natasha used to get when she was anticipating something, like her brain was scanning through every possible outcome.\n\u201cSooo,\u201d Steve said.\nThe Soldier didn\u2019t move his head, but his eyebrows furrowed slightly and he slid a look at Steve out of the corner of his eye.\n\u201cRight, yeah,\u201d Steve said, then raked his wet hair back. \u201cIt\u2019s just that\u2014I don\u2019t want you to feel pressured into anything, and you know, we can go at your pace, or\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSteve,\u201d the Soldier said.\nSteve turned to him, mouth hanging open. The Soldier had never said his name before.\n\u201cShut up,\u201d the Soldier said.\nSteve\u2019s mouth clicked shut. He snorted. \u201cRude.\u201d\nThe Soldier lowered his eyes, and even though Steve couldn\u2019t see his entire face, he somehow knew the Soldier was amused. Warmth bloomed in his chest. Yeah, they would be alright.\nHe followed the Soldier out of the elevator and to his apartment door\u2014which, okay, was a little weird, since as far as he knew, the Winter Soldier had never been there before. But then again, he was the Winter Soldier. He probably had the entire Tower canvassed. He did have to protest when the door opened for the Soldier without any complaint.\n\u201cHey,\u201d he said. Even more alarming, the lights didn\u2019t automatically turn on. The storm was raging outside, but that shouldn\u2019t have affected the electricity in the Avengers Tower, since the building was entirely self-sufficient. Besides, they had just stepped off the elevator. Steve frowned, taking his phone from his back pocket, but his screen was blank. If there was some sort of breach in the Tower, Tony would have at least texted him.\n\u201cFRIDAY?\u201d he asked. She didn\u2019t answer.\nIt was then Steve realized that his family room was filled with a warm glow, despite the lights not turning on. Frowning, Steve crossed his kitchen, then froze.\nLittle glass globes hung from his ceiling in varying lengths, glowing warm with tea lights, like dozens of golden bubbles. Steve walked into his family room, turning in a slow circle. \nThe Soldier stood in front of the large bay window overlooking the city, watching Steve with fathomless eyes. He\u2019d draped his coat over the back of a kitchen chair and had finger-combed his wet hair away from his forehead. In the glow of the candlelight, limned in gold, he took Steve\u2019s breath away.\n\u201cSoldier?\u201d Steve whispered, awed. \u201cWhat is all of this?\u201d\nThe Soldier\u2019s shoulders lifted and fell again as he released a deep, shuddery breath. \u201cSomeone told me that you should do a grand gesture if you want to\u2014if\u2014\u201d He\u2019d started out strong, but then seemed to run out of words, hissing in frustration.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d Steve said, knee-jerk.\nThe Soldier held out one hand, stopping him. \u201cThere was only one thing that I could think to do.\u201d He hesitated for a long moment, then lifted his hands to his face. \nThe Soldier took off his mask.\nBucky Barnes set the mask on the coffee table. His hand trembled slightly, so he closed it into a fist, and brought it back to his side.\nSteve had gone so still that Bucky wasn\u2019t even sure he was breathing. \n\u201cHi, Stevie,\u201d Bucky said.\nSteve jolted like he\u2019d been electrocuted. He staggered forward one step, before stopping again and shaking his head, his eyes impossibly wide, his mouth soft with shock. \u201cBucky?\u201d \nBucky closed his eyes against the sudden tightness in his throat. It had been a long time since someone had called him by any name. \nDecades ago, Bucky had ziplined to a train that would eventually end in his death. Now his chest felt tight with the same fear and elation he\u2019d felt from flying down that cable. He wanted to fling open the window, leap from the side of the building, and start running and never stop. \nInstead, he cleared his throat, swallowed thickly, and spoke.\n\u201cFor the longest time, I\u2019ve spent my life just existing. If I felt anything at all, it was rage, or a need for revenge. But mostly I just operated like every day was a mission. And then you appeared, with your falafels and chocolate, and it was like\u2014it was like coming back to life.\u201d His lips quirked into a shaky smile. \u201cIf nothing else\u2014thank you. For that.\u201d\nSteve looked stricken, as if Bucky had punched him in the stomach with his metal fist and knocked all the air out of him.\n\u201cAnd. I wanted to tell you that\u2014I know\u2014I know I\u2019m not the man you were probably expecting, but\u2014I love you. So much, and for so long,\u201d Bucky said hoarsely, meeting Steve\u2019s eyes. It was the bravest thing he had done in his entire long life. Steve blinked, dislodging a tear from wet eyelashes. \u201cAnd I think we can\u2014I think we can be happy together.\u201d\nSteve staggered forward, wrapping one hand around Bucky\u2019s wrist. He was shaking so hard that Bucky could feel the vibration in his own bones. Steve\u2019s breaths seemed stuck in his chest, like back when they were just dumb kids and Steve would get an asthma attack from a strong wind. \n\u201cBucky?\u201d Steve repeated, like the name was wrenched out of him.\n\u201cHey, punk,\u201d Bucky said, and then Steve\u2019s knees went out, and they both went down to the floor.\nSpider-Man slowly tiptoed across the ceiling on his hands and feet, the screens of his mask so wide the whites nearly took over his entire face. When the Winter Soldier and Captain America had come back thirty minutes early, he had done the most logical thing he could think to do: he sprang straight up and hid on the ceiling. Now he carefully avoided the webs he had painstakingly hung for the Soldier\u2014for Bucky Barnes, oh my god, oh my god, Mr. Stark had neglected to mention that he would be playing matchmaker for Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes.\nOnce he had crawled his way to the safety of the kitchen, he dropped to the ground on cat\u2019s feet, landing on all fours. It took a moment for him to stand up, since his knees had been replaced by jello. \nHoly shit. Holy shit. Ned was never going to believe this.\nThey ended up sprawled on the family room floor, couch cushions tugged down for pillows, staring up at the golden baubles with stinging eyes. One of Steve\u2019s hands was wrapped tightly around Bucky\u2019s metal wrist, as if he were afraid to let go.\n\u201cHuh,\u201d Bucky said. Steve rolled his head toward him. \u201cDidn\u2019t think about the clean up.\u201d\nSteve huffed a laugh, then swung himself over, draping half his body on top of Bucky. \u201cLeave them.\u201d\n\u201cKind of a fire hazard, too\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLeave them.\u201d\nThere was still so much to say, but for now Steve seemed content with soaking in Bucky\u2019s presence. Bucky was completely fine with that. It had been too long since he had been touched. As the Soldier, he hadn\u2019t even realized he missed it. Now that he had Steve pressed up against him, he\u2019d saw off his other arm before he pushed him off.\n\u201cEarlier,\u201d Steve said, then cleared his throat. \u201cEarlier, it sounded like you thought I\u2019d be disappointed to find out who you were.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Bucky said, fidgeting with the hem of Steve\u2019s shirt. \u201cNot disappointed, but\u2014I mean\u2014\u201d He huffed an irritated sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s always been you for me, but I know that you didn\u2019t feel the same way about me. Back then.\u201d\n\u201cI knew your eyes.\u201d\nBucky pressed his head back into the cushion to frown at the top of Steve\u2019s head. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cWhen I first saw you. As the Soldier. Don\u2019t get me wrong,\u201d he said, pushing himself up to stare earnestly down at Bucky. \u201cYou\u2014Bucky, what you\u2019ve done, how you\u2019ve survived, you\u2019re amazing, and I wasn\u2019t lying when I told you that I care for you. But when I first saw you\u2014I knew your eyes, and it was like getting sucker punched.\u201d Steve brushed a lock of hair away from Bucky\u2019s forehead, then traced his finger along the corner of his eye. \u201cI love you, Bucky Barnes. Always have, always will.\u201d\nBucky listened to the quiet patter of rain against the window; muted, because of Stark\u2019s soundproofing, but not enough to block out everything, and nonexistent on the inside. He could hear the electric hum inside the walls, and the steady thudding of Steve\u2019s slightly elevated heartbeat. For the first time in his entire life, a kind of quiet peace settled over him. \n\u201cBuck?\u201d Steve asked, slightly worried.\n\u201cYou\u2019re such a punk,\u201d said Bucky, and he leaned up on his elbows, and kissed him.\n\u00a0\nEPILOGUE\nIt was a wonderful day. The sky was blue, the birds were singing, the air was clean like it only got after a good rain. Spring was the start of Murad\u2019s busy season, and he was kept moving for most of the day by tourists and businessmen and women needing lunch or a mid afternoon pick-me-up. \nHe\u2019d just handed some change back to a young blonde woman pushing a stroller when a man came up to his cart. Now, Murad had lived in New York his entire long life. He\u2019d seen his share of roughs\u2014been bullied by many of them, made friends with even more. This man, though. This man looked young, but felt old, and powerful, and bristled with defensive anger.\nMurad put on his friendliest smile. Kill with kindness, as the saying went. \u201cHow can I help you, young man?\u201d\n\u201cHere,\u201d the man said, thrusting a red box at Murad so quickly he nearly smacked him on the nose. Chocolate, apparently, from Jacques Torres. Murad took it out of self preservation, and caught the envelope that had been resting on top of it before it slid to the ground. The man watched him steadily, with blank-eyed patience. Murad set the chocolates on a clean corner of his cart, then shucked the card out from its envelope. It was one of those motivational thank you cards, with watercolor flowers painted at the corners. Murad\u2019s eyebrows shot up. He opened the card, but there was nothing written inside.\nWhy did this angry man with murderous eyes want to thank him? Murad glanced at him, confused, but the man just waited, as if he expected something in return.\n\u201cUm, you\u2019re welcome?\u201d said Murad.\nApparently, this was the right thing to say. The man nodded curtly, even managing a small, tight smile.\nAs the man left him, Murad glanced down at the box of chocolates sitting on his cart. The plastic seal appeared unbroken, which meant they shouldn\u2019t be poisoned.\n\u201cHey!\u201d someone called, drawing Murad\u2019s attention. Captain Rogers bounded up to the angry man, slinging an arm over his shoulders. \u201cDid you finish what you needed to do?\u201d\nThe man smiled warmly up at Captain Rogers. It changed his entire face, stripped years away, made him young and in love. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said, sliding his metal arm around Captain Rogers\u2019 waist.\n\u201cOhhhh,\u201d Murad said, as comprehension dawned. Grinning to himself, he pulled the plastic wrap from the box and popped a piece of chocolate into his mouth, satisfied with a job well done. \nIt was a wonderful day."
