So as it turns out, I am incapable of updating any faster. I probably should have noted at the beginning that I would be slow to update, apologies! Unfortunately the combination of the commute, a 9-5, and fabbo work \u2018busy season\u2019 leaves little time outside of the weekend for life\u2019s finer pursuits (fanfic). Why, you might ask, did I embark on a 20,000+ word fic in the middle of busy season then? Good question, I have no impulse control.</p>\n<p>Thank you for the frankly gorgeous comments on this fic. I am honestly blown away. I am quite concerned that I won\u2019t quite live up to the expectations I never anticipated having! Thank you all for making me, on many many occasions, silently dance in the bathroom at work while reading your comments. I\u2019m not even kidding.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_3_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Note: Yuuri's descent into drunken disarray is unfortunately quite accurately modeled on my usual trajectory after overdoing the vodka. Including the rapid bounce back to sobriety, which gives you plenty of time to really think about all the ill-advised things you might have done.</p>\n<p>Where they are flying is irrelevant to the story, mainly because I can't really justify (without significant weaseling) why they'd be flying any route that takes 25 hours. The only people flying that are Australians trying to escape their 46 degrees hellhole of a country.</p>",
    "text": "\n0 hours and 50 minutes until take-off\n\nYuuri slid a bookmark between the pages of his book and gently closed it. Almost five minutes until boarding. He stretched and rolled his shoulders against the wall, pushing fern leaves out of his face. All the seats had been taken by the time he arrived at the gate and he\u2019d tucked himself down on the floor instead. It was a quiet spot, hidden between a pillar and a pot plant, and he\u2019d spent the past twenty minutes sitting there on the tiles charging his phone.\nHe heard the quick footsteps before he saw the person. Nice looking sneakers shoved into view in front of him as someone ran directly into his spot. Grabbing his phone, Yuuri yanked his knees to his chest and glanced up.\nVictor Nikiforov was stripping in front of him.\nHis hoodie. Scarf. Victor. Victor was ripping clothes off. Yuuri\u2019s book fell from his limp fingers to the floor.\n\u2018Fans are following me and I\u2019m hiding.\u2019 Victor shoved in close against the wall, breathing heavily and down to his t-shirt.\n\u2018Um-\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s not that I\u2019m ungrateful but my flight is boarding in five minutes and I\u2019m tired,\u2019 Victor said all in one breathless whisper.\nYuri stared.\nFootsteps clattered down the hall behind the potted fern and a group of teenagers charged past in a sudden burst of noise. Hands braced against the wall, Victor held his gaze and Yuuri was pinned in place by blue eyes. They stared silently at each other as the herd thundered by and echoed down the walkway. It was almost an afterthought to realise he was holding his breath. Finally, Victor blinked and looked away. He glanced over his shoulder and carefully leaned away from the wall, craning his neck to look down the walkway. Yuuri watched mesmerised as Victor\u2019s collarbone jutted out, a sharp line beneath pale skin.\n\u2018Well,\u2019 Victor\u2019s voice lifted as he turned back to Yuuri, \u2018that was exciting. My apologies for dumping those clothes on you, I thought it would make me less noticeable.\u2019\nYuuri wordlessly held up his clothes, receiving another grin in return. Victor\u2019s smile was ever so slightly lopsided, how had he never noticed that in the pictures? Their hands brushed as he took back his clothes and Yuuri tried to stop staring at his face.\n\u00a0\n\n0 hours and 35 minutes until take-off\n\nSomeone probably announced the boarding call, someone probably checked his pass, his passport was probably scanned, but in a daze, Yuuri wandered down the aerobridge with no real memory of how he\u2019d got there.\nIt was obvious that Victor had no idea who he was, for which Yuuri was both eternally grateful and slightly depressed. He was glad Victor did not immediately recognise him as the skater who failed so spectacularly at the GPF, however it was disheartening that he had made so little impression even despite failing spectacularly. Was he really that plain and boring? No, Yuuri decided, he was going to spend the next half an hour feeling depressed rather than grateful.\nThe plane was half full when the attendant waved Yuuri down the right side aisle and it took a few minutes of weaving and waiting to reach his seat. The plane was a big airbus, one of the ones with two aisles and a set of four seats in the centre row. He\u2019d tried to book a seat on the centre aisle but the system had allocated him the next one along, stating that 54D was unavailable. When he\u2019d then tried to take 54G that too was unavailable. At that point he simply took the middle seat at risk of being allocated somewhere worse and resolved to be more organised next time.\nSat in his 54E seat, it was with a distant sort of horror that Yuuri watched Victor approach down the aisle. Twice in one day. He hurriedly looked down at his bag and leaned forward in the seat, waiting for Victor to pass. Was seeing him at the airport not bad enough? Why did they have to be on the same flight? He should have realised when Victor said he was boarding in five minutes. Yuuri groaned into his hands. What would he have done anyway? Changed flight? Victor didn\u2019t recognise him so what did it matter? Still, Yuuri kept his face down and tried not to feel completely inadequate.\n\u2018Hello again,\u2019 a familiar accented voice said cheerfully.\nYuuri died on the inside.\n\u2018Who is this?\u2019 Another voice asked with a definite note of annoyance.\n\u2018Someone you\u2019ve just offended probably,\u2019 Victor said calmly as he shoved his bag into the overhead locker. He bent down and flashed Yuuri a smile. \u2018Sorry, ignore him. He is young and unpleasant.\u2019\n\u2018Hey.\u2019 Young and Unpleasant thumped into the seat beside Yuuri and stared at him. \u2018This armrest?\u2019 He tapped the one between their seats. \u2018This one is mine, so don\u2019t even think about touching it.\u2019\n\u2018Ah, Yuri, so charming. Try not to flirt so obviously with the nice man.\u2019 Victor slid gracefully into his seat and flashed Yuri a wink.\nThe teenager turned bright red and shoved himself halfway across Yuuri\u2019s space, hissing a response. \u2018I wasn\u2019t fucking flirting with him you-\u2019 he spat out rapid-fire Russian. Yuuri cringed back into the headrest. Victor shot back in Russian, cool and unruffled as he untangled his headset. Fervently wishing he was elsewhere, Yuuri stared straight ahead and attempted to mould with the seat as the two argued at an increasingly rapid pace across him. This was going to be a fantastic 15 hours. Yuri wrenched off his seatbelt and-\n\u2018Yakov.\u2019 A large hand suddenly appeared in front of Yuuri, palm offered. Yuri was silent and pinned to the seat with Yakov\u2019s other hand spread firmly over his face.\nYuuri tentatively shook Yakov\u2019s outstretched hand. \u2018Yuuri.\u2019\nUnpleasant Yuri made an indignant noise into Yakov\u2019s hand. Victor threw his head back and laughed. Even Yakov\u2019s face cracked into something that could be briefly termed a smile.\n\u2018So, my saviour speaks.\u2019 Bright blue eyes stared into Yuuri\u2019s, crinkled at the edge with amusement. \u2018I\u2019m Victor.\u2019\n\nMy entire bedroom is covered in pictures of your face.\n\n\u2018Nice to meet you, Victor,\u2019 Yuuri said politely and slipped his hand into Victor\u2019s. He was touching Victor Nikiforov. Touching him. His hand was warm and soft, grip firm. Yuuri could feel the individual press of every one of Victor\u2019s fingers against the back of his hand. His internal scream was close to becoming external and he forced his expression to remain blank.\nVictor withdrew his hand with a friendly smile and Yuuri congratulated himself on having handled that with minimal overt creepiness. He\u2019d just never be able to wash his hand ever again now. Yuuri sank back into his seat and stared fixedly at the blank screen ahead. It was also possible he wouldn\u2019t be able to use the bathroom for the entire flight as that would involve either climbing over the aggressive Russian teenager and the stoic man or shuffling his backside past Victor\u2019s face and all things considered he\u2019d rather just let his bladder burst.\n\u2018I think perhaps I didn\u2019t make a good impression earlier?\u2019\nSurprised, Yuuri turned without thinking to face Victor. Who was leaning against the armrest. Putting his face approximately three inches from Victor\u2019s. How was he supposed to do this? An entire flight next to Victor, who was openly regarding him with a faint smile and the most perfect blue eyes?\n\u2018You surprised me,\u2019 Yuuri said awkwardly.\n\u2018Ah,\u2019 Victor looked down and toyed with the edge of the armrest, \u2018well, if that was all it was-\u2019 he glanced up at Yuuri, still with that smile.\nYuuri didn\u2019t know how to respond to that or even what response Victor was looking for. Confused, he looked away. \u2018Do you want to change seats?\u2019\n\u2018Nope,\u2019 Victor said cheerfully, \u2018this seat is perfect.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\n0 hours and 0 minutes\n\nThe plane taxied slowly out across the runways. Victor already had his headphones in and was slumped comfortably back in the seat. Yuri was rapidly switching between the outside cameras, leaning closer to his screen with a widening grin. On his right, Yakov was downing what looked like sleeping tablets and adjusting the height of his compression socks. With a final grimace, Yakov tucked his hands under his arms and leaned back in the seat like a man condemned.\nAs the plane lifted off, Yuuri couldn\u2019t help but wonder what he\u2019d got himself into.\n\u00a0\n\n1 hour and 03 minutes\n\n\u2018Sorry to wake you,\u2019 Victor said quietly, \u2018they\u2019re bringing the food around. I thought you might want to wake up for dinner.\u2019\nYuuri blinked and shoved his glasses back up. He added waking up to Victor\u2019s hand on my shoulder to the list of things he would never forget. \u2018That would depend on what the dinner is,\u2019 Yuuri muttered. He hid his face to the side and hurriedly felt over his cheek. What if he had drooled in his sleep? What if Victor saw?\n\u2018Do you fly much? You sound like a man who has flown before.\u2019\n\u2018A few times.\u2019 He could do this, he could talk normally to Victor. He could be casual. \u2018You?\u2019\n\u2018For work, yes. A lot.\u2019 Victor accepted something covered in foil from the flight attendant. He politely passed across Yuuri\u2019s pasta meal. \u2018I don\u2019t usually do this sort of distance though.\u2019\n\u2018I suppose it\u2019s plenty of time to catch up on movies.\u2019 He was going to be casual if it killed him. He ripped the lid off the water cup and took a quick gulp.\n\u2018Any recommendations for me?\u2019\n\u2018I - I was going to watch Disney movies,\u2019 Yuuri confessed, because apparently being both casual and cool was more than he could handle.\nTo his surprise Victor\u2019s face lit up. He bit his fork, holding it between his teeth as he tapped at the screen with both hands. \u2018D\u2019you reckon they have 101 Dalmatians?\u2019 His voice was muffled and slurred around the fork. \u2018I love dogs.\u2019 He removed the fork. \u2018I love dogs,\u2019 he clarified and then looked at Yuuri. \u2018Sorry, I\u2019m keeping you from eating. Ignore me, I\u2019ll fall asleep soon enough.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\n1 hour and 05 minutes\n\nYuuri swallowed and flicked a glance across at Victor. He cleared his throat. \u2018I\u2019m not sure if this is really pasta.\u2019\nFoil rustling, Victor looked up from unwrapping his meal. Within a minute or two he had made another comment on the quality of aeroplane food and Yuuri relaxed, reassured his invitation to continue talking had been understood.\nIt was established by joint investigation that no, the grey mass on the tray definitely didn\u2019t look like pasta. Victor leaned just a little across their shared armrest and watched as Yuuri carefully unwrapped each item on his tray. He was close enough that Yuuri could see each individual crinkle at the corner of his eyes. Yuuri pulled the plastic off a rock hard bread roll and fought to keep his gaze fixed ahead. He ripped the packaging from his cutlery. Slowly, his gaze crept sideways. Victor had the smallest brown freckle to the left of his nose.\n\u2018Do I have something on my face?\u2019\nYuuri felt his face burn and his heart squeezed in his throat. \u2018You have a freckle.\u2019\nIdiot! Why did he say that?\nFor a moment Victor just looked surprised. Then his expression settled into something that could only be called playful. \u2018This one?\u2019 He tapped his cheek and tilted his head, gazing at Yuuri.\nGlowing with embarrassment, Yuuri could only nod. Salvation came in the form of an aggressive teenager, rescuing him from Victor\u2019s openly contemplative, amused gaze.\n\u2018Why does his look better than mine?\u2019 Yuri demanded and stabbed his fork accusingly at Yuuri\u2019s meal.\nIt was a moment of solidarity between the three of them as they inspected the contents of Yuri\u2019s tray.\n\u2018That\u2019s quite disgusting,\u2019 Victor said finally. Yuuri wanted to agree but felt somewhat uncomfortable criticising a relative stranger\u2019s food. \u2018I thought I\u2019d seen everything cabbage related. I\u2019m Russian,\u2019 Victor confided to Yuuri, \u2018we know cabbage.\u2019\n\u2018You sound like Gru when you speak English,\u2019 Yuri cut in.\n\u2018Yuri,\u2019 Victor said quite pleasantly, \u2018I am going to take this carrot and I am going to shove-\u2019\nYuri cackled.\n\u2018Are you both from Russia?\u2019\n\u2018He\u2019s Russia\u2019s golden boy-\u2019\n\u2018Better that than Russia\u2019s brat,\u2019 Victor said loudly.\n\u2018I don\u2019t chased through airports by stupid fans-\u2019\nVictor sighed and rolled his eyes at Yuri before turning to face Yuuri. \u2018I have competed in athletic events and I have a small number of fans, that\u2019s all. If you could not refer to them as stupid,\u2019 that was directed pointedly at Yuri, who sniggered in response and stabbed at his food.\nModesty was not a trait Yuuri had expected Victor to possess. Honesty, open and occasionally unthinking, was more Victor\u2019s style. He was as quick to criticise his own performance when justified as he was to declare his competence.\n\u2018Anyway,\u2019 Victor continued, \u2018I\u2019ll be stopping that soon so it hardly matters.\u2019\nYuuri choked on pasta.\n\u00a0\n\n2 hours and 14 minutes\n\nQuitting skating?\nAeroplane blanket draped around his shoulders, Victor slumped back in the seat and played with his phone, a half-frown on his face. Yuuri tried to imagine a skating world without Victor Nikiforov in it. He was magic. How could he quit? He could still remember the wonder and excitement he felt seeing Victor skate for the first time, the effortless way he moved and the grace in his body.\nVictor absently rolled his headphone cable between his lips and scrolled on his phone. One knee bent and the other leg stretched out, he made even boredom look graceful. This was the man that had skated Stammi Vicino and he was going to just stop? It\u2019s true he was older than most figure skaters, but he was also better than most figure skaters. Why would he stop? His performance at last year\u2019s GPF had been nothing short of technical perfection. Yuuri stared back at his screen and watched blankly, taking nothing in, his mind fixed entirely on the man sitting next to him.\nAfter another five minutes he gave up. Yanking his headphones off, Yuuri switched off the screen. His face glared back at him in the black reflection, confused and a little more annoyed than he had any right to be.\n\u2018Movie not that good?\u2019\nYuuri looked at him and Victor raised one ash blond eyebrow. Yuuri sighed and pushed his frustration aside. \u2018Didn\u2019t give it a chance really, I wasn\u2019t watching it properly.\u2019\nVictor looked marginally less bored. \u2018Thinking deep thoughts on this flight?\u2019\n\u2018Work.\u2019 It was half true.\n\u2018What do you do?\u2019\n\u2018Nothing I\u2019m particularly good at. You?\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m in a - transitional stage, you could say.\u2019\nYuuri curled his toes in his sneakers. \u2018You said you were quitting competitive sport? That\u2019s what you do, isn\u2019t it?\u2019\nLounging in his seat, Victor still managed to look comfortably at ease, but a small frown line appeared between his eyebrows. \u2018I\u2019ve found that sometimes the reasons you have for doing something disappear over time, gradually, so slowly you don\u2019t even notice. Until one day you realise they\u2019ve gone and you\u2019ve just been continuing out of habit. But, to answer your question with less drama, yes, I am thinking of stopping.\u2019\n\u2018What sort of sport?\u2019\nVictor looked at him for a long, quiet moment then smiled and shook his head. \u2018Doesn\u2019t matter. Especially if I\u2019m not doing it anymore, no? Come on, I\u2019ve unburdened my thoughts to you, now you must tell me something in return.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ve stopped practising for months now. I know what good looks like, and I don\u2019t think I can ever get there.\u2019\n\u2018How long have you been practising this thing?\u2019\n\u2018Since I was about five or six.\u2019\n\u2018Bah,\u2019 Victor waved it away, \u2018then you\u2019re either modest or lying to yourself.\u2019\n\u2018What if,\u2019 Yuuri slowly voiced what was eating at him, \u2018what if like you, my reason had gone?\u2019 You, being like you, beating you, that was my reason for skating.\n\u2018Then that would be a shame. I\u2019d look at your reasons and make sure they were the right ones. Maybe you could find a better reason?\u2019\n\u2018Couldn\u2019t you do the same?\u2019\nThe last of the boredom disappeared from Victor\u2019s face and he smiled a small, genuine smile. \u2018Perhaps. I haven\u2019t found one yet.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\n2 hours and 57 minutes\n\n\u00a0When Yuuri drifted out his half-nap, the seat next to him was empty. He immediately pulled himself out of his sleepy state to hurry to the toilet, seizing the opportunity granted by the empty seat. If he was really lucky Victor would still be gone by the time he came back and he wouldn\u2019t have to shove past Victor\u2019s seat with his butt at eye-height.\nAnd despite all previous evidence to the contrary, it would seem in this moment the world smiled down at him because on his return the seat was still empty. Standing on his toes, Yuuri peered down the aisle and yep, seat was definitely still empty.\n\u2018Stretching your legs too?\u2019\nEmpty because its occupant was standing behind him. Yuuri turned around and promptly staggered as the plane jerked.\n\u2018The Captain has switched on the fasten seatbelt sign, if everyone could please return t-\u2019\nAnother drop and Yuuri stumbled forward. Victor caught his forearm and held him steady, his other hand hovering just above Yuuri\u2019s waist. It could have been the roll and dip of the plane making Yuuri\u2019s stomach clench, but Victor\u2019s bright blue eyes were so close and his smile wide- Distracted, Yuuri found himself staring at the freckle on Victor\u2019s cheek.\n\u2018Nervous flyer?\u2019\n\u2018No,\u2019 Yuuri said honestly.\n\u2018Neither.\u2019 Victor\u2019s hand tightened on Yuuri\u2019s arm as the plane shuddered again. \u2018This is quite exciting.\u2019 Quite casually he laid his hand on Yuuri\u2019s waist.\n\u2018We have to return to our seats.\u2019\n\u2018Mm, I know.\u2019 Victor didn\u2019t move his hands. Yuuri wasn\u2019t sure if he wanted him to.\nAs it turned out, it wasn\u2019t a decision he had to make. A flight attendant hurried up the aisle and shepherded them to their seats, citing brief turbulence. Doing up his seatbelt, Yuuri could still feel the pressure of Victor\u2019s hand.\n\nWhat just happened?\n\n\u00a0\n\n4 hours and 22 minutes\n\nCheek mashed against the edge of the headrest, Victor breathed heavily through his open mouth and gave the occasional snore.\nIt would have been a peaceful, cute scene if not for Yuri staring at Victor with undisguised glee and grinning like a goblin. He motioned at Victor and silently held out his phone to Yuuri. With only brief hesitation, Yuuri accepted the phone and received a thumbs up in return.\nEven sleeping Victor looked unfairly handsome. Personally, Yuuri thought the photos he took just showed Victor at a different attractive angle, however Yuri clearly felt differently and seized the phone with both hands, swiping through and snickering.\n\u2018If he drools, you take more,\u2019 Yuri ordered in a whisper, pointing at Yuuri as he shuffled out of his seat and past Yakov.\n\u00a0\n\n4 hours and 54 minutes\n\nYuuri agonised over waking up Victor. On one hand, Yuri had been missing a long time. On the other hand, plane food wasn\u2019t always the greatest and if it was him camping out in the bathroom, he\u2019d really rather everyone just pretend he hadn\u2019t been glued there for thirty-two minutes.\nFinally, Yuuri touched Victor\u2019s shoulder. He gave it a tentative shake.\n\u2018I\u2019m sorry to wake you up, and it might be absolutely nothing, but Yuri hasn\u2019t come back to his seat.\u2019\nVictor screwed up his face and blinked. He slowly hauled himself upright and blinked again. \u2018Sorry, what?\u2019 His voice was rough with sleep and Yuuri felt his ears go red.\n\u2018Yuri\u2019s been gone for half an hour.\u2019\nIt took a little longer for Victor to properly wake up to a state where he could process information and act on it. Watching Victor push his hair back and stretch, Yuuri felt like he was intruding on something. It was one thing to have posters of an idol on your wall, it was entirely something else to watch them yawn into the back of their hand and tug down a crumpled hoodie.\n\u2018Alright,\u2019 Victor pulled himself out of the seat, \u2018let\u2019s go find him.\u2019\nYuuri wasn\u2019t sure why Victor was including him in this search, but he scrambled out anyway.\nIt took approximately 10 seconds to locate Yuri.\nA ring of flight attendants and a growing crowd of passengers surrounded one of the toilet doors, one of the passengers had their arm up against the door and was calling through. Victor froze and then shoved froward, pushing past people with badly concealed fear.\n\u2018What happened? Is it Yuri in there? Is he okay?\u2019\nThe flight attendant turned with professionally diplomatic expression. \u2018The door appears to have jammed. It seems someone is temporarily stuck in there.\u2019\nVictor stared. Then he choked out a sudden laugh. He quickly composed his face and turned away. With one hand held up for silence, he slowly approached the toilet and leaned his shoulder against the door.\n\u2018Yuri,\u2019Victor\u2019s voice shook with suppressed laughter, \u2018Yuri, I hear you\u2019ve trapped yourself in a toilet?\u2019\nA stream of angry Russian blasted out of the cubicle and Victor dissolved in laughter. If Yuuri had expected Victor to have a charming, refined laugh then he was wrong. Victor made a sound like a dying duck and snorted out a helpless honking noise. It was a fantastically ugly laugh. It was great. Victor choked back something in Russian and the door rocked with a violent thud. Victor slumped against the wall and cried into his hand.\nUsually, an attendant explained, they could simply unlock the door from the outside, but it seemed something had stuck in the mechanism itself. Yuuri hung back as more capable people rattled and shoved strategically at the door, aided by the flight staff. Victor was banned from helping with the extraction efforts when it became apparent that all he wanted to do was take pictures and cry with laughter.\nIt was only a matter of minutes before the door clicked audibly and folded open, one woman having applied her engineering skills. Victor let out a shaky sigh and wiped his eyes.\nYuri emerged looking like murder.\nVictor lost it again.\n\u00a0\n\n5 hours and 02 minutes\n\n\u2018Hey, Yuri, remember that time you got stuck in an aeroplane toilet?\u2019\nYuuri cringed back into his seat as Yuri shoved himself out and lunged for Victor.\n\u00a0\n\n5 hours and 03 minutes\n\n\u2018Yuuri,\u2019 Victor leaned in close and whispered loudly, \u2018does something smell strange to you? Almost like\u2026a toilet?\u2019\nAt this point Yuuri was regretting his seat between Victor and Yuri. He was reminded quite forcefully of several long car trips with his sister when they were younger.\n\u00a0\n\n5 hours and 05 minutes\n\n\u2018Yuuri-\u2019\n\u2018Are you sure you don\u2019t want to swap seats?\u2019 Yuuri asked loudly.\n\u00a0\n\n5 hours and 09 minutes\n\nThis time Victor managed to hold it in for a bit longer. But evidently the upper limit of his restraint was around five minutes.\n\u2018We should tell embarrassing stories. It\u2019ll pass the time. Yuri, you can give us a recap of the time you got trapped in a public toilet.\u2019\nSeveral explosive words later and more tears of laughter from Victor, and Victor returned in earnest to sharing stories.\n\u2018Yuri doesn\u2019t need to contribute because we already know his. You first, Yuuri.\u2019\n\nCompletely embarrassing himself on the ice yet still being so unremarkable that Victor didn\n\u2019t recognise him, not after the competition and not now?\n\n\u2018I - I fell during a competition. Everyone was watching\u2026\u2019 Yuuri trailed off, cursing his stupidity. He should have just made something up. Yuri was looking at him with narrowed eyes. Face bright red, Yuuri stared down at his feet.\n\u2018Oh, a competition? You\u2019re an athlete?\u2019 Victor sounded delighted.\n\u2018Just ballet.\u2019 This time Yuuri had the sense to lie.\n\u2018Oh.\u2019 This time there was a warmer note to the appreciation in Victor\u2019s voice. Yuri groaned quietly. \u2018Don\u2019t suppose you have any pictures on your phone of you performing?\u2019\nWhy exactly Victor cared about that was a mystery. Confused, Yuuri glanced between Yuri\u2019s embarrassed face and Victor\u2019s steady gaze. \u2018No, sorry.\u2019\n\u2018Shame.\u2019 Victor sounded like he meant it.\n\u2018Big competitions?\u2019 Yuri asked suddenly.\n\u2018What?\u2019\n\u2018Have you performed in big competitions? You look familiar.\u2019\n\u2018No. No. I\u2019m definitely not that good. You wouldn\u2019t have seen me, unless you came to a small town in Japan,\u2019 Yuuri tried to joke and was very aware he reeked of desperation.\nYuri\u2019s eyes were hard and blue and searching and Yuuri wanted to shrink back into his seat. \u2018You\u2019re Japanese?\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019 This wasn\u2019t going anywhere good.\n\u2018How old are you?\u2019\n\u2018Are we interrogating Yuuri?\u2019 Victor leaned into the conversation, casually pressing his shoulder against Yuuri\u2019s. \u2018Can I join in?\u2019\nWith a final searching stare, Yuri tucked back into his own seat and snapped his headphones on. Yuuri breathed a sigh of relief.\n\u2018Don\u2019t mind him. Of all the people I have sat beside on flights, you are quite my favourite.\u2019\n\u2018Oh.\u2019 Yuuri swallowed. \u2018Well, you\u2019re my favourite too.\u2019\nVictor pushed their shared armrest up and tucked his knee up, shuffling in the seat to face Yuuri. For a brief moment he just watched with a half-smile. Then his smile deepened. \u2018You haven\u2019t heard my embarrassing story.\u2019\nListening to Victor talk, the chatter and hum of conversation in the cabin faded. He was oddly captivating. This wasn\u2019t what Yuuri had expected. It was true, he\u2019d imagined what it might be like to meet his idol in person, what he might say and how he\u2019d come off as calm and competent. Victor would be charming and friendly and would compliment him on his skating, and Yuuri would be left feeling validated as an equal. Instead this Victor was curled up in his seat, his hair messy and eyes engaging. He paused his story to laugh and rub his nose, continuing on with a sweeping hand gesture and another messy laugh.\nYuuri was barely following what Victor said, caught up instead in his expressions and the sound of his voice, until-\n\u2018So do you think I have stubble again? I think I do.\u2019 Victor dragged his palm down his jaw. \u2018Can you see it?\u2019\nHonestly Yuuri couldn\u2019t see anything. He said as much and tried not to stare as Victor rubbed over his cheek. It was unfairly mesmerising.\n\u2018No really,\u2019 Victor grabbed Yuuri\u2019s hand and pressed it to his jaw, \u2018feel that.\u2019\nThere was the faintest of prickle beneath his hand. \u2018I\u2019d have to wait at least five years to grow stubble that long,\u2019 Yuuri said a little wistfully. He swiped his thumb down Victor\u2019s cheek, feeling the change from smooth skin to stubble.\n\u2018You\u2019re lucky.\u2019\n\u2018What if I wanted to have a moustache one day?\u2019 Yuuri mused, only half focusing on what Victor said as he drifted his thumb back and forth. He jolted back to reality when Victor chuckled and he felt his jaw shift beneath his palm. Oh, god, he needed to move his hand. What was he doing?\n\u2018It\u2019s like a tiny strip of velcro beneath your nose.\u2019 Victor moved Yuuri\u2019s fingers to his upper lip. \u2018See? Who would want to kiss that?\u2019\nGreat, he was touching Victor\u2019s face and thinking about kissing him. Yuuri wasn\u2019t sure if his face could physically get any redder. \u2018I think it\u2019s fine,\u2019 he mumbled.\n\u2018Really? I\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u2019 Victor winked and Yuuri snatched his hand back.\n\u00a0\n\n5 hours and 19 minutes\n\nWith a wiggle, Yuuri turned sideways in his seat and tried to position himself so that his elbows wouldn\u2019t club either Victor or Yuri in the face. He pulled the hem of his jumper up and tried to shuffle carefully out of it. It was doomed to failure from the start. Everything tangled and twisted and Yuuri was left with his arms pinned above his head, his glasses crushed into his forehead, his t-shirt tucked up, and probably half of his bare chest exposed. Thinking fast and starting to sweat, Yuuri gave the hem another desperate yank and yelped as it tugged on his ear.\n\u2018Victor.\u2019 Yuuri heard Yuri say in a weary sort of voice.\n\u2018Um-\u2019 Yuuri hurriedly tried to pull his arms down before Victor looked around to an eyeful of his unimpressive bare chest thanks Yuri? His frantic wriggle was stopped by hands on his elbows and a soft laugh.\n\u2018You know you could have just asked for help.\u2019 Victor\u2019s voice was amused and soft and far too close. Yuuri went still as Victor\u2019s hands traced two slow lines down his chest. Yes, he did tug down his t-shirt for him, but all Yuuri could focus on was the brush of Victor\u2019s knuckles against his bare skin. Was that much touching necessary? Did Victor really need to slip his palm up the front of his throat just to pull the jumper over his chin? Or was he just reading too much into it? Victor was being polite and he was simply seeing what wasn\u2019t there.\nFreed from smothering fabric, Yuuri stared through lopsided glasses into Victor\u2019s face. He was very close and very attractive and Yuuri couldn\u2019t attribute all of his flush to being trapped in a sweater.\n\u2018Your glasses are crooked.\u2019 Victor reached out and gently straightened them.\n\u00a0\n\n5 hours and 23 minutes\n\nYuuri couldn\u2019t help but notice that Victor hadn\u2019t put the armrest back down.\n\u00a0\n\n6 hours and 48 minutes\n\nThe lights had long been fully dimmed and the cabin was dark, people tucked beneath blankets and sleeping in silence. The constant background drone of the plane and the dark, still cabin had Yuuri\u2019s eyes drifting shut. He felt heavy and warm, on the verge of sleep.\n\u2018Can I ask you something?\u2019\nYuri blinked and tugged his blanket down a little, exposing his face. Victor wasn\u2019t even looking at him. He was staring down with a blank expression at his outstretched feet.\n\u2018Of course,\u2019 his voice was rough with sleep.\n\u2018Have you ever felt that feeling,\u2019 Victor began slowly, picking at the stitching on the seat in front, \u2018that even when you\u2019re surrounded by people, and everyone knows your name, you\u2019re completely alone? It\u2019s a strange feeling. Like no one truly cares what you think or feel, they only want to see what they expect of you.\u2019 He fell silent, then dropped his hand from the seat. \u2018Sorry. You\u2019re wanting to sleep-\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t have a huge fan following, and I rarely have an entire stadium of people knowing my name, but yes, I know something of that feeling.\u2019 Yuuri shifted upright in his seat and felt Victor\u2019s eyes follow him curiously. It was easier to feel bold in the dark. \u2018In my case though I have my own cripplingly awkward personality to thank. I imagine your situation is a little different.\u2019\nVictor breathed a chuckle and dipped his head, Yuuri watched as his hair slid down in a wave of silver and black shadow. \u2018Yuri told you that I skate, did he? For something I love, it hasn\u2019t brought as much happiness as I thought it would. At least not recently.\u2019\nThey sat in silence together, the aeroplane humming in the background. Yuuri fought the urge to reach out and gently run his fingers through Victor\u2019s hair, which would be wildly inappropriate and all kinds of creepy. Eventually Victor lifted his head and gazed quietly at Yuuri.\n\u2018And I don\u2019t think you\u2019re cripplingly awkward, Yuuri, I think you\u2019re quiet and you\u2019re kind.\u2019\nYuuri was glad for the dark cabin that hid his red face. \u2018I\u2019d prefer to be like you.\u2019\n\u2018Like me?\u2019\n\u2018Ah - you\u2019re- I mean how you spoke with me, you were friendly. I\u2019d like to be that confident talking to people,\u2019 Yuuri backtracked hastily. He had meant the way Victor was on the rink and interviews, his easy charm and confidence, the way he would laugh and always say the right thing. But he had forgotten, these weren\u2019t things he was supposed to know.\n\u2018Better to be quiet and make genuine friends.\u2019\n\u2018Unless you\u2019re too quiet to make many friends.\u2019\n\u2018Well,\u2019 Victor tipped his head against the head rest and gazed openly at Yuuri, a half-smile tugging at the corner of his mouth, \u2018I think you\u2019re quite charming.\u2019\nWas he -? Was he being flirted with? His heart in his throat, Yuuri stared at Victor with absolutely no idea how to react. Victor\u2019s smile deepened for a moment and then he slowly rolled his head away, facing forward once again.\n\u2018Perhaps I should let you sleep,\u2019 Victor said.\n\u2018No,\u2019 Yuuri said quickly. \u2018I mean, unless you\u2019re tired.\u2019\nVictor shifted comfortably and stretched his legs out, lightly brushing his foot against Yuuri\u2019s ankle. He didn\u2019t say anything about it and Yuuri kept perfectly still, hyper aware of every point their legs touched. \u2018Perhaps then you could tell me something about yourself. Given I am spending the next nine or so hours at your side.\u2019\nYuuri looked at him in silence before replying. \u2018You want to be distracted, don\u2019t you?\u2019\nVictor\u2019s eyes snapped to Yuuri\u2019s, surprised, and then his expression softened into something unreadable. \u2018How astute.\u2019\nStill feeling blurred at the edges and heavy pull of sleep, Yuuri didn\u2019t reply. He untucked the edge of his blanket and dropped it over Victor\u2019s legs. \u2018It feels colder with the lights down, don\u2019t you think?\u2019\nVictor remained silent, watching Yuuri\u2019s movements instead. Yuuri relaxed back and pretended he couldn\u2019t feel Victor\u2019s eyes on him. Eventually Victor followed Yuuri\u2019s gaze up to the roof of the cabin. The roof was dimmed to a midnight blue and tiny soft lights glowed all along the ceiling like a galaxy of stars.\n\u2018It\u2019s like star gazing,\u2019 Yuuri said quietly. If he leaned back, if he relaxed, it was almost possible to imagine he was staring up into the night sky, that the little lights were distant stars. He turned his head and was surprised to find Victor looking at him and not the roof. Victor\u2019s expression was soft and Yuuri didn\u2019t quite know what to do about that. He tried a smile in return and Victor just stared quietly a moment longer, then he settled back into his seat with their shoulders almost touching.\n\u2018What do you think that one is?\u2019 Victor pointed up at one of the pin-prick lights on the ceiling. The backs of his fingers brushed Yuuri\u2019s wrist beneath the blanket.\n\u2018Aquarius, definitely,\u2019 Yuuri said confidently, grinning in the dark as Victor snickered beside him. He told himself he could be brave. He carefully twitched his index finger and pushed back against Victor\u2019s hand. Victor fell silent and under the blanket he laid his hand flat, both a question and an invitation. Yuuri slid his hand into Victor\u2019s and gently pressed their palms together, his breath catching as Victor curled his fingers up through his. For the second time that day Yuuri could feel the press of Victor\u2019s fingertips to the back of his hand, a firm pressure just below his knuckles. He was holding hands with Victor.\n\u2018And that one?\u2019 Victor\u2019s voice was quieter and closer.\n\u2018The Fish.\u2019 Yuuri shifted to let their shoulders brush together.\n\u2018Ah, The Fish. A well known constellation.\u2019\n\u2018Please don\u2019t question my astrological knowledge.\u2019\nVictor chuckled, a warm, intimate sound so close to Yuuri\u2019s ear. \u2018Sorry, sorry. Forgive my impertinence.\u2019\nThe seat creaked as Yuuri moved and tilted his head towards Victor, resting his forehead against Victor\u2019s. He felt soft hair against his skin and the surprised stutter of breath over his cheek. Then Victor sighed and shifted closer in a way that felt very deliberate. He pressed his nose to Yuuri\u2019s cheek and breathed deeply again. \u2018You know,\u2019 Victor murmured and fingertips trailed Yuuri\u2019s jaw, \u2018I would kiss you,\u2019 up over his cheekbone, \u2018right now,\u2019 down over the corner of his mouth, \u2018if you wanted.\u2019\nHe did want and Victor was gorgeous and his thumb was drawing a slow pattern beneath his lower lip and Yuuri kissed him.\nVictor responded immediately with a stifled moan and slid his hand into Yuuri\u2019s hair, gripping and holding him close. His mouth was warm and he kissed with a slow, firm intensity. Yuuri tilted his head and let the pressure of Victor\u2019s hand in his hair guide him. Beneath the blanket Victor clutched their hands tighter. Yuuri gripped hard, an anchor as Victor\u2019s mouth moved against his own, open and gently insistent. He could hardly focus. His heart pounded in his ears and everything narrowed to the feel of Victor\u2019s hands and mouth. He was being kissed. Victor\u2019s hold shifted in his hair and urged him forward, kissing him deeply. He caught Yuuri\u2019s bottom lip between his and tugged slowly. Yuuri\u2019s answering groan was embarrassingly loud.\nHe felt rather than saw Victor\u2019s intimate little smile as he drew back. Gazing at him from an inch away, Victor\u2019s eyes were dark and lips wet. Yuuri felt stunned.\n\u2018Well,\u2019 Victor said simply, keeping that little smile.\n\u2018You were flirting with me, weren\u2019t you?\u2019 Yuuri asked, dazed.\n\u2018Yes, thank you for noticing. I was trying very hard.\u2019\nHe couldn\u2019t help it, he had to laugh, a stuttering hysterical sort of laugh. It was either that or go mad. He\u2019d just kissed Victor Nikiforov. Been kissed by Victor Nikiforov. Quite thoroughly kissed.\nHe\u2019d never kissed anyone before.\nWithout any sense of hesitation and awkwardness, Victor settled down comfortably beside Yuuri, giving their hands a brief squeeze. \u2018I think I\u2019ll sleep well now,\u2019 he murmured, eyes already closed. \u2018Feel free to wake me with a kiss. I\u2019d like to do that again.\u2019\nHead spinning, Yuuri stared down at Victor, who was firmly settled against his shoulder. Who was going to sleep. Yuuri transferred his wide-eyed stare forward and felt like he was fraying at the edges. He had no illusions that he was anything but Victor\u2019s distraction. You don\u2019t kiss a stranger on the plane after seven hours with an expectation of anything else. It was nothing. Even in Yuuri\u2019s dazed mind he could process that thought. This meant nothing. In eight hours they would land for the stopover and that would be the last of Victor.\n\u00a0\n\n11 hours and 37 minutes\n\nYuuri woke up with rose-tinted sunlight streaming through the cabin, the thin, lazy light of early dawn. People were beginning to stir around the cabin and he could heard the occasional murmured conversation. Victor was a warm, solid weight on his shoulder. His head had slumped down, his cheek against Yuuri\u2019s collarbone and hair soft against his neck. Their hands were still loosely tangled under the pile of blankets. Yuuri\u2019s heart ached. He\u2019d never felt so alone, realising what he could have if he was only a little braver, a little better. He could wake up to this every morning, a partner asleep at his side. Instead he was travelling alone and someone was flirting with him to pass the time.\n\u2018I think I\u2019ve dribbled on you,\u2019 Victor mumbled into his neck. Yuuri felt him shift and the warmth of his cheek disappeared. \u2018Yep, sorry, that\u2019s drool.\u2019\n\u2018Gross,\u2019 Yuuri flashed a smile. Victor made it so easy to smile. His answering grin was pure sleepy laziness. Watching Victor stretch and stifle a yawn, Yuuri wondered what came next in this - this thing they were doing. Was it over now? What had the point even been, had Victor flirted with him just to amuse himself? Victor\u2019s hair brushed Yuuri\u2019s cheek as he shifted and Yuuri told himself to stop over-thinking. What did it matter why Victor had noticed him? He could enjoy it without caring and without any attachment. He could be casual.\nVictor used the sleeve of his hoodie to pat Yuuri\u2019s neck dry.\nWell, he\u2019d never actually dated anyone and he had no experience in any sort of casual fling. But he was sure he could do it.\n\u2018Ah, as you can see,\u2019 Victor leaned back as the steward passed Yuuri\u2019s tray across, \u2018I have organised breakfast for you. Isn\u2019t that romantic?\u2019\n\u2018Just me and the four hundred other passengers?\u2019\nVictor whipped the lid off his meal with a flourish. \u2018Pure coincidence that they\u2019re getting breakfast now too. Do you want my orange juice? I\u2019m not a fan.\u2019\nYuuri received both the juice and a teasing touch to his wrist, Victor slid his fingers over the back of his hand and stroked up the inside of his wrist. Acting on impulse, Yuuri caught his fingers and curled their palms together. Victor winked at him.\nBeside him, Yuri was starting to stir, currently still slumped down with his back propped against Yakov\u2019s shoulder. Yakov appeared to be slowly emerging from whatever drug-induced coma he had put himself into.\n\u2018Morning,\u2019 Victor said brightly. He took a large bite of croissant, apparently perfectly happy to eat left-handed and leave his hand in Yuuri\u2019s. \u2018Sleep well?\u2019\n\u2018How,\u2019 Yakov cleared his throat a few times, \u2018how long?\n\u2018Three or so hours to Dubai.\u2019\nYakov merely grunted and heaved himself upright in the chair, ruffling Yuri\u2019s hair as he moved. Yuuri only half listened as the three of them talked, distracted by the slow swipe of Victor\u2019s thumb across his palm.\n\u2018Did I miss anything, boys?\u2019 Yuuri tuned in to hear Yakov ask.\nVictor\u2019s head snapped up with a wicked grin in place. \u2018Well-\u2019\n\u2018Shut the fuck up, Victor!\u2019\n\u2018-got himself locked-\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019re such an ars-\u2019\n\u2018- forty minutes-\u2019\nYakov just watched them both with a mildly long-suffering expression. He looked down and continued buttering his croissant as they talked over each other. Over the past twelve or so hours Yuuri had been well exposed to the Nikiforov-Plisetsky squabble and its usual trajectory, he too ate his yoghurt and ignored the insults flying over his head. Yakov shot Yuuri a side-long glance under Yuri\u2019s waving arm and rolled his eyes heaven-wards.\n\u2018-and Victor spend the whole time hitting on Yuuri,\u2019 Yuri declared.\n\u2018Poor Yuuri.\u2019\n\u2018He noticed after about seven hours,\u2019 Victor said around a mouthful of croissant, just a touch defensively.\n\u2018Can\u2019t have been doing a very good job,\u2019 Yakov noted.\nCheeks burning, Yuuri stared straight ahead and chewed his breakfast. As if he needed any more confirmation that this was a game for Victor.\n\u2018Well, that\u2019s one way to pass the time.\u2019 And apparently having said all he needed to say, Yakov shuffled his headphones on and settled in to finish breakfast with Lethal Weapon.\nVictor nudged their knees together and tilted his head, making an effort to swallow his croissant before speaking. \u2018You really didn\u2019t notice, did you? I really wasn\u2019t subtle.\u2019\nNever had Yuuri been so interested in scooping every last bit of yoghurt out, looking resolutely down. \u2018Not really my area,\u2019 he muttered.\n\u2018I thought perhaps you weren\u2019t interested, but-\u2019 Victor deliberately trailed off with a very knowing grin.\nYuuri gave a short burst of laughter despite himself. \u2018Oh, but you\u2019re too handsome for that?\u2019\n\u2018Well-\u2019 Victor shrugged and lowered his lashes, then immediately grinned. \u2018No, well maybe, but I meant I saw your face a few times and you seemed\u2026quite interested.\u2019\nIt was easier to remain silent and let his bright red face do the talking.\n\u2018Lucky for you, you might have had to watch movies during the flight otherwise,\u2019 Yuuri finally found his voice.\n\u2018How boring. This was far better.\u2019\nBecause of course, Victor must flirt with many people. As Yakov said, it was a way to pass the time.\n\u2018And having achieved your goal of catching my attention, what will you do for the next three hours?\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m certainly not going to start watching movies now. I will finish breakfast and then read, using your shoulder as a cushion. Unless you want to kiss me again?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\n12 hours and 02 minutes\n\n\u2018Is this uncomfortable?\u2019\n\u2018A little,\u2019 Yuuri admitted and shifted around the armrest in his back.\n\u2018Shame,\u2019 Victor said lightly and made no effort to move.\nFor a long moment Yuuri sat there, frozen in uncertainty. He couldn\u2019t just shove Victor. True to his word, Victor had slumped against Yuuri, pulled out a book, and proceeded to read without any hint of awkwardness. He\u2019d even reached behind and adjusted Yuuri\u2019s arm and position for maximum comfort. Yuuri now found himself wedged in the corner of his own seat, half turned to the side with Victor\u2019s back flush against his front.\nTentatively, he pushed Victor\u2019s back. He told himself it would be better if Victor just moved away. Maybe they could hold hands a few more times, Victor would tease him a little, and then they would part in a few hours. Victor would forget the man he spent a couple of hours with on a flight and Yuuri would remember he had once kissed Victor Nikiforov. Nothing more.\nBut -\nYuuri shuffled a pillow behind his own back and then tugged Victor in against his chest again. Victor tipped his head back, his hair warm and soft beneath Yuuri\u2019s chin, and grinned. There was definitely a lopsided tilt to his mouth when he smiled, it was a strange feeling, being close enough to another person to notice a thing like that. And an overwhelming feeling was that of Victor curled against his chest, solid in his arms and content to simply relax there.\n\u2018You know, I\u2019ve travelled first class enough times,\u2019 Victor\u2019s back hummed against Yuuri\u2019s chest, he could as much feel his voice as hear it, \u2018but I\u2019ve never been quite this comfortable.\u2019\n\u2018This isn\u2019t a service they offer in first class?\u2019\nHe felt Victor laugh, felt the shake of his shoulders and shift in his breathing. He was caught between anxiety and a deep, aching longing. His chest hurt with it. He wanted Victor, or maybe he just wanted someone to hold like he now held Victor. He wanted someone to want him like he wanted this.\nHe should have left it at the kiss. He shouldn\u2019t have even kissed him.\n\u2018For the record, Yuuri, I\u2019m not sure why you think you\u2019re awkward. If I had met you in St Petersburg we\u2019d have got coffee together and it would have been fun.\u2019\n\u2018But we won\u2019t.\u2019\n\u2018No, I don\u2019t suppose we will.\u2019 There was a strange note in Victor\u2019s voice.\nOne blanket was tangled around Victor\u2019s legs and half draped on the floor, the other bunched beneath Yuuri\u2019s thighs. With the armrest raised and Victor sprawled across Yuuri, there was no longer any divide between their seats. It was a lazy, comfortable scene. Victor\u2019s body was heavy and warm and his clothes rumpled from sleep. The wrappers and empty containers from breakfast were still piled on the trays and the cabin still felt as though it drifted on the edge of wakefulness. Yuuri half-listened idly as the man in front murmured to his little son, quiet giggles occasionally breaking the hush.\n\u2018Do you think I\u2019m making the right decision?\u2019\n\u2018Hm?\u2019 Yuuri blinked.\nVictor let his book drop to his chest and dangled his arm to the floor. \u2018Taking a break from skating. Quitting skating.\u2019\nIt would be so easy, almost effortless to run his hand down Victor\u2019s arm. Not that he should be thinking that after spending just twelve hours with someone get a grip. \n\u2018I know you don\u2019t know me,\u2019 Victor took his silence for confusion. \u2018But that\u2019s half the appeal, isn\u2019t it? I feel like I can trust you.\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m qualified to comment,\u2019 Yuuri said with sixteen years detailed knowledge of Victor Nikiforov\u2019s career.\nYuuri felt Victor shrug and he dragged his fingertip idly along the carpet. \u2018I liked your perceptiveness earlier, before I fell asleep. And your honesty.\u2019\n\u2018It - it sounds like you\u2019ve lost the reason you enjoyed skating. I doubt you\u2019ll find it again if you just quit.\u2019\n\u2018See?\u2019 Victor twisted in his arms and smiled from a devastating two inches away. \u2018That\u2019s why I asked you. I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve never heard of me, I couldn\u2019t talk to you like this if you knew who I was.\u2019\nAnd like a deceitful, deceptive lying snake, Yuuri stared awkwardly back.\n\u00a0\n\n12 hours and 18 minutes\n\nVictor\u2019s laughter brought Yuuri out his doze. It was a chuckle, a quieter sound for him.\n\u2018Mm?\u2019 Yuuri rubbed his face and adjusted his glasses.\n\u2018This bit.\u2019 Victor held his book up with his finger marking a line. \u2018Four lines down, read the tenant\u2019s part.\u2019\nYuuri blinked, waiting for his eyes to focus, and then blinked again. A slab of Cyrillic stared back at him. \u2018I can\u2019t-\u2019\n\u2018Ah!\u2019 Victor clutched his book back with an embarrassed laugh. \u2018I forgot. I\u2019m sorry.\u2019\nHearing embarrassment in Victor\u2019s voice was new, and oddly endearing. Yuuri found himself hastening to reassure him. \u2018What does it say?\u2019\nQuietly, his back vibrating against Yuuri\u2019s chest, Victor read the passage aloud. He read in Russian, pausing to explain in English, often correcting himself as he struggled for the best translation, eager to make Yuuri understand it was funnier in Russian. Yuuri honestly couldn\u2019t have cared less. Victor\u2019s voice was warm and low and he drifted to the shape and sound of the words. Eyes closed, Yuuri was content to simply listen to the sound of Victor reading.\n\u00a0\n\n12 hours and 27 minutes\n\n\u2018I\u2019m bored.\u2019 Yuri wrenched his headphones off.\n\u2018That\u2019s nice,\u2019 Victor replied absently, flipping the page of his book. Somehow Yuuri\u2019s hand had found its way to Victor\u2019s hip and now rested there as he drifted on the edge of sleep.\n\u2018My legs are cramping and this fucking seat is too small and I\u2019m bored.\u2019\n\u2018Hi Bored, I\u2019m-\u2019\n\u00a0\n\n12 hours and 36 minutes\n\nBored as he was, it was another ten minutes before Yuri could bring himself to speak to Victor again.\n\u2018Cards?\u2019 Even then the question was aimed more at Yuuri than Victor.\nOn the one hand that would mean losing the warm press of Victor\u2019s body against his chest, but on the other it would mean a greater degree of sanity and the ability to focus on something other than Victor\u2019s hair touching his chin. As they both shuffled upright in their own seats Yuuri tried to tell himself that he didn\u2019t already miss the feel of Victor curled in his arms. Because that would be stupid and not something that someone in a casual, meaningless fling would feel.\nYuuri was too aware of Victor\u2019s hands, his smile, the position of his legs, the way he leaned forward as Yuri dealt the cards. Yuuri knew all the ways they could touch, the places their arms and hands would brush together if he could just make himself move closer. If he could make himself braver. If he could tell himself that\u2019s what Victor wanted too. But he couldn\u2019t and it wasn\u2019t so it hardly mattered. Yuuri scooped up his hand of cards.\n\u00a0\n\n12 hours and 41 minutes\n\n\u2018How-\u2019\n\n\u2018You\u2019re a filthy fucking cheater, Nikiforov!\u2019\n\n\u2018You two are definitely not as good as you think,\u2019 Victor said happily. \u2018Another round? I think I\u2019ll win again.\u2019\nYuri was already slapping the cards back down on the tray table. It was apparent that none of them reacted well to being beaten. And Victor was unable to refrain from projecting a smug air of confident self-assurance. The furious glint in Yuri\u2019s eyes was only building with every bright exclamation from Victor and Yuuri was desperately trying to pretend he could lose with more grace. At this rate they\u2019d still be playing cards as the plane touched down in Dubai.\n\u00a0\n\n12 hours and 54 minutes\n\nIt ended thirteen minutes later when Yuri attempted to flip the tray table.\n\u00a0\n\n12 hours and 58 minutes\n\nFace burning, Yuuri hurried down the aisle.\nVictor looked up as he stumbled to a halt beside their row. Hand braced on the seat in front, he made to stand up and let Yuuri past, then he stopped. His expression flashed between curiosity, amusement, something a little more wicked and a little more teasing. \u2018You look like the end of a story. What happened?\u2019\n\u2018Nothing,\u2019 Yuuri muttered and tried to push past.\nVictor stretched his legs out and blocked the gap.\n\u2018I-\u2019 Yuuri looked over his shoulder and pushed in closer, \u2018I felt up a man. Accidentally.\u2019\nVictor looked at him in incredulous silence for a moment then burst into laughter. He withdrew his legs and Yuuri shove past. \u2018How?\u2019\nYuuri hunkered down in his seat. \u2018I went to the wrong seat.\u2019 Victor\u2019s delighted laughter wasn\u2019t helping. Sinking down further, Yuuri hid his face behind the seat in front.\n\u2018And who, might I ask,\u2019 Victor\u2019s eyes, crinkled at the corners, said he already knew the answer, \u2018where you actually intending to grope?\u2019\n\u2018I was not intending to grope anyone,\u2019 Yuuri said with as much dignity as he could. \u2018But the man had blond hair-\u2019\n\u2018And you thought it was me and you\u2019d get a bit of a feel as you stepped in?\u2019\n\u2018No!\u2019 Yuuri blushed furiously as Victor burst into laughter again. \u2018I just - I was going to touch your shoulder and ask you to move and I sort of touched your neck a bit too only it wasn\u2019t you.\u2019\n\u2018Do you want to touch my neck now?\u2019\n\u2018No!\u2019 Yuuri ignored Victor\u2019s laughter. He pulled out his phone and pointedly refused to look sideways, even as he fought a smile. It was a battle he lost.\n\u00a0\n\n13 hours and 01 minute\n\n\u2018Uno.\u2019 Yuri smacked the pack down on the table. \u2018We\u2019re playing Uno.\u2019\n\u2018Excellent! I\u2019m very good at Uno,\u2019 Victor declared. A muscle twitched along Yuri\u2019s jaw.\nIt was hard enough concentrating when Victor played cards like a shark, let alone when he crowded in close, his right leg tucked up and pressed to Yuuri\u2019s thigh. He had turned in his seat to face the table, left leg still on the ground and right bent at the knee up on the seat. Victor was no fool. Yuuri strongly suspected the casual hand that occasionally stroked his side was an act of seductive sabotage.\nWhen the hand returned again Yuuri caught it firmly by the wrist and deposited it back in Victor\u2019s lap. Yuri snickered. Victor looked mildly put out.\n\u2018Not as smooth as you like to think, Nikiforov.\u2019\nIgnoring Yuri, Victor shifted in the seat and shuffled forward. \u2018Yuuri,\u2019 Victor cleared his throat and gently laid his hand on Yuuri\u2019s leg, leaning in closer, \u2018we\u2019ve had fun together, haven\u2019t we?\u2019 Yuri made a noise like a sick cat \u00a0and Victor gazed steadily at Yuuri with wide, soft eyes. \u2018You have only three cards left, you wouldn\u2019t use them against me, would you?\u2019 His cheek dimpled with suppressed laughter.\n\u2018Betray me and I will fuck you up,\u2019 Yuri declared.\nVictor squeezed Yuuri\u2019s leg and smiled warmly. Staring into inviting blue eyes, Yuuri slowly laid down his skip card. Yuri exploded and Victor slammed his final card down with a triumphant yell and snatched his hand off Yuuri\u2019s leg. \u2018Ha!\u2019\nYuri looked at Yuuri in utter disgust. \u2018You-\u2019\n\u2018You didn\u2019t say Uno,\u2019 Yuuri said.\nThere was a split second of silence as Victor looked up with complete surprise on his face and Yuri\u2019s expression morphed into incredulous delight.\n\u2018Ooo-\u2019\n\u2018You played me,\u2019 Victor said with a mix of disbelief and appreciation. \u2018You played me.\u2019\n\u2018You are definitely not as charming as you think,\u2019 Yuuri repeated his words back with a smile.\nVictor burst into laughter, a messy spontaneous laugh that spilled out with a grin. He grabbed the back of Yuuri\u2019s head and kissed him. A brief enthusiastic kiss, teeth clacking as Victor still grinned. Opening his eyes, Victor\u2019s fingers still in his hair, Yuuri stared dazed into Victor\u2019s blue eyes at close range.\nVictor grinned back at him. \u2018You sure?\u2019\nNo, of course not, Victor was every bit as charming as he thought with his hair tumbling down his forehead, eyes bright and teasing. Yuuri tried to shrug casually while his heart pounded in his ears.\n\u2018We won.\u2019 This looked to be a high that Yuri would ride for some time.\n\u2018First time in eleven months, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 Victor\u2019s hand slipped from Yuuri\u2019s neck and Yuuri swayed a little closer to him.\n\u2018Fuck you.\u2019 But even then there wasn\u2019t much feeling behind it and his expression was the closest to happiness that Yuuri had seen.\n\u00a0\n\n13 hours and 07 minutes \n\nHe could tell Victor wanted to say something. The seat creaked as he shifted with a restraint that was quite unlike Victor. Feeling eyes on him, Yuuri continued looking down at his phone. Finally -\n\u2018So have you had a slump in ballet before?\u2019\nYuuri almost groaned. This was dangerous territory with too many opportunities to slip and say something he shouldn\u2019t. Clicking off his phone, Yuuri stared at his reflection in the black screen for a moment before steeling himself and looking up. \u2018I think you skate at a very different level to me. I\u2019m not sure I want to keep going anymore, but my concerns are a bit more mundane than yours.\u2019 He reluctantly kept explaining when Victor tilted his head curiously. \u2018If I\u2019ve understood correctly, you\u2019re stopping because you\u2019re lacking in inspiration and motivation, I\u2019m stopping because I\u2019m lacking in ability.\u2019\nTo his surprise, Victor didn\u2019t immediately scoff at that. \u2018Really?\u2019 He asked simply.\n\u2018I\u2019m good, I\u2019m really good,\u2019 Yuuri said honestly and Victor smiled, \u2018but I\u2019m not good enough. I don\u2019t think I can ever get there.\u2019\n\u2018Not on your own, no. When I hear someone with talent and dedication say they can\u2019t progress, I start looking at who\u2019s coaching them. And I don\u2019t mean anything against your instructor but it doesn\u2019t sound like they\u2019re the right fit for you anymore. Once you get to a certain level it\u2019s not just a question of technical ability, your coach has to be able to bring that other something out in you.\u2019\nIt was the most serious and earnest that Yuuri had seen Victor this flight.\n\u2018That\u2019s if you\u2019re as good as you say,\u2019 Victor added. Yuuri almost smiled, that was more Victor.\n\u2018Does your coach do that?\u2019 Yuuri asked.\nVictor pointed across at where Yakov was methodically palming peanuts into his mouth. \u2018That\u2019s my coach.\u2019\nYuuri had to arrange his expression into surprise, as if this was news to him. \u2018And he\u2019s the right fit for you?\u2019\nThey watched as Yakov absently picked a peanut off his jacket and ate it. \u2018More or less.\u2019 Victor grinned then sobered. \u2018But inspiration is a personal thing I guess, if I can\u2019t find it for myself then there\u2019s no point anymore. What keeps you dancing?\u2019\n\u2018As I said before, I\u2019m not as good as you. My motivation is less - personal. I just want to be as good as another s -\u00a0 dancer.\u2019\nVictor smiled. \u2018You want to beat them?\u2019\nYuuri laughed, both at the thought of beating Victor and the whole absurdity of this situation. He was saying this to Victor\u2019s face, Victor. \u2018No, I\u2019d settle for just being as good. That\u2019s more realistic.\u2019\n\u2018Well, I want to surprise people, keep people wondering what I\u2019ll do. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve always done. But I don\u2019t know what to do anymore, I\u2019m too - too technical? I can do everything and I can do it correctly and it\u2019s boring. You\u2019re a dancer, you understand that don\u2019t you?\u2019\nYuuri, with a mere thirty percent hit rate for landing quads, just nodded.\n\u2018Maybe I\u2019ve just been skating for too long? It\u2019s been more than two decades. Maybe I\u2019ve done everything I can.\u2019\nYuuri got the sense Victor was letting this spill out for the first time. He didn\u2019t seem to need an answer and simply wanted someone to listen as he sounded out his thoughts. Yuuri listened as Victor continued, talking around his doubts and start as a child, occasionally looking at Yuuri for agreement.\n\u2018-and the stress aged you, turned your hair grey,\u2019 Yuri cut in after a period of eavesdropping.\n\u2018It\u2019s not grey,\u2019 Victor immediately broke off from his story to respond.\n\u2018At least it\u2019s not down to your butt anymore, \u0431\u0430\u0431\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0430.\u2019\nYuuri felt obliged to mount a defence of Victor\u2019s past long hair, object of his childhood envy and admiration. \u2018I thought it looked good.\u2019\nVictor laughed. \u2018Did Yuri show you?\u2019\nHe wasn\u2019t supposed to know that. They were 35,000ft in the air, he couldn\u2019t even say he\u2019d googled.\n\u2018I-\u2019 Yuuri found himself staring desperately at Yuri, who stared back with an inscrutable expression.\n\u2018Yep,\u2019 Yuri said finally in a bored tone. \u2018You were an ugly kid.\u2019\nYuuri started breathing again.\n\u2018Well,\u2019 Victor stretched and looped his ankle over Yuuri\u2019s, \u2018Yuuri thinks I was cute.\u2019\nHaving fulfilled his unpleasantness quota for the hour, Yuri snorted and turned away. Victor didn\u2019t speak any further over his skating but he reached across and squeezed Yuuri\u2019s hand in silent thanks. Yuuri felt quite unreasonably flat. He wouldn\u2019t have any further conversations with Victor like this. They weren\u2019t friends and Victor had no real interest in him, not as a quick distraction and certainly not as an easily forgotten failed skater.\nIt was a belated realisation and utterly pointless at this time, but Yuuri reflected that he maybe had gone and got far too attached.\n\u00a0\n\n14 hours and 11 minutes\n\nYuuri shuffled onto his side and froze. Yuri was staring intently at him from five inches away. His expression could best be described as searching. Yuuri hurriedly rolled back the other way.\n\u2018You can snooze on me, if you want,\u2019 Victor offered casually, only glancing briefly away from his book.\nNeither his heart or his sanity was likely to survive that. Yuuri awkwardly declined and settled even more awkwardly against the edge of the headrest, trying to appear comfortable in a hard chair and zero degree recline. Eyes closed and glasses jammed crooked, he willed himself to sleep.\n\u2018You\u2019re not comfortable. Lay on me.\u2019\nIt wasn\u2019t an offer, it was a hand on Yuuri\u2019s upper-arm and a firm tug sideways. His cheek hit Victor\u2019s shoulder and he froze. He laid there, rigid, as Victor made a satisfied noise and shifted.\nThe seat had been fine. The seat didn\u2019t smell like lazy, sleepy warmth, the faintest trace of cologne mixed with sweat and fabric softener. But Victor was all of those things and Yuuri didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\u2018Better?\u2019\nEmotionally or physically? Yuuri gave up and just relaxed into Victor\u2019s side. Why was he bothering to fight this? Just an hour to Dubai, and then the next time he saw Victor it would be on a tv screen. He shuffled in a little closer and tucked his forehead against Victor\u2019s neck.\n\u2018Oh,\u2019 Victor said quietly, almost surprised. \u2018You-\u2019\nWhatever he\u2019d intended to say next never came. Just the lightest touch of fingers to Yuuri\u2019s cheek instead. In a surprisingly intimate gesture, Victor gently brushed the hair from Yuuri\u2019s temple.\n\u00a0\n\n14 hours and 27 minutes\n\nThey were collecting headphones. The flight attendants were walking down the aisle looping headphones around their arms. On the other side blankets were being bundled and dropped into large garbage bags. Yuuri watched with a strange feeling as his blanket was dumped into the bag. That was the blanket he had draped across Victor, held his hand beneath it. Then he just felt stupid because it was a blanket. Beside him, Victor was absorbed entirely in his book and merely handed his own blanket over with a distracted thanks.\n\u2018You boys have everything organised?\u2019 Yakov asked. Yuuri noted he was included in that. \u2018Passports? Phones?\u2019\nYuuri bent down to drag his bag out from under the seat. This really was it. He realised he didn\u2019t even know where Victor was flying to next, he could be connecting to anywhere from Dubai. He probably wouldn\u2019t even have the same stopover time.\n\u2018Boarding passes?\u2019 Yuri asked in an unexpected display of caring.\nHis passport bitten between his teeth, Yuuri waved his boarding pass in the air and searched through his bag with his other hand. Yuri grabbed Yuuri\u2019s wrist with a horribly suspicious expression, he stared at his boarding passes and then back up at Yuuri\u2019s face. Yuuri watched with a flat kind of horror as Yuri\u2019s expression turned triumphant. Unexpectedly caring indeed.\n\u2018It\u2019s spelled differently,\u2019 Victor said, looking up at them. \u2018Your names. Japanese versus Russian translation to English, right?\u2019\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 Yuuri said immediately. \u2018Yes, that\u2019s what we were looking at.\u2019\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 Yuri echoed, eyes not leaving Yuuri\u2019s face.\nWell, there it was. He knew. And all Yuuri could feel was a vague, distant sense of horror, buried beneath resignation. Either way, whether Yuri exposed him or not, he wouldn\u2019t see Victor again. He tried to tell himself that yes, obviously, there was a pretty big difference between Victor forgetting their strange flirting thing and remembering him as a lying creep. And that rationally he\u2019d much rather be forgotten and the fact that Yuri knew was an unmitigated disaster just waiting to happen and his idol of sixteen years was going to hate him, did he really want that? But somehow his mind, and maybe his heart, remained stuck. Somehow nothing mattered as much as never seeing Victor again.\nHe shouldn\u2019t, but Yuuri ignored Yuri. He tucked his boarding pass in his pocket and nudged Victor\u2019s arm. \u2018Do you mind if I-\u2019\nVictor was already slinging his arm around Yuuri and tugging him down against his shoulder before he finished.\n\u00a0\n\n14 hours and 59 minutes\n\nYuuri held Victor\u2019s hand as the plane landed, their fingers tangled loosely together. The plane shuddered as the wheels touched down and Victor squeezed tightly, just for a moment.\n\u00a0\n\n15 hours and 11 minutes\n\nIt was with mixed feelings that Yuuri unclipped his seatbelt. His hands felt heavy and slow, a pressing sense of reluctant and regret settling over him. The past fifteen hours had been something from a dream. An improbable mix of strange, awkward, embarrassing, and perfect moments. The noise level in the plane rose as people moved about the cabin, rustling through bags and dragging clattering luggage down from the lockers, families calling out to each other and children raising their voices after hours of shushed quiet. Yuuri let the noise buzz over his head as he bent down to organise his bag. The sound of his own heartbeat and breathing was loud in his ears. He hadn\u2019t wanted this flight to end.\nBut they were standing up now.\nThis would be the last of the fun, attractive, well-meaning man that he had spent the last fifteen hours with. He found himself thinking of Victor\u2019s crooked smile, the big untamed smile that crinkled in the corners of his eyes and wrinkled his nose, his perfectly messy and genuine smile. Who would see that grin now? Not that he had any right to know or proper reason to care. It was just he\u2019d never seen that smile before, not in any interview or poster or performance.\n\u2018Why aren\u2019t we fucking moving?\u2019 Yuri thumped into Yuuri\u2019s back. He used his bag as a battering ram and shoved forward again.\nFor all Yuri\u2019s loud anger, there wasn\u2019t much force in his shove. Yuuri was instead just pushed against Victor\u2019s back and honestly couldn\u2019t bring himself to care much about moving. Not that he could even if he wanted to. The aisle was at a standstill with a long line of people stretching back from the doors, the usual process for disembarking a flight. Most people were simply standing with an acceptable degree of tired patience.\nYuri\u2019s bag hit Yuuri\u2019s back again.\n\u2018I know.\u2019 Was what Yuuri heard hissed by his ear, because of course all this depressing moment needed was blackmail by an angry Russian teenager.\nYuuri left his cheek pressed to Victor\u2019s shoulder-blades and exhaled slowly. If Yuri was going to choose this moment to exact his revenge or deliver justice or whatever it was he had planned, then it was going to take place with Yuuri leaning against Victor Nikiforov and holding onto the last moments of this dream.\n\u2018Know what?\u2019Victor asked over his shoulder.\nFor once Yuuri wished that Victor was as vague and scattered as he sometimes acted. Unfortunately not many things seemed to pass Victor by.\n\u2018Yuuri has something to tell you.\u2019\nVictor\u2019s back shifted beneath Yuuri\u2019s cheek. \u2018Oh?\u2019\n\u2018I wish this flight wasn\u2019t ending,\u2019 Yuuri blurted out, before Victor could turn around and before Yuri could respond.\nVoices still rose and fell around them, but Yuuri could almost feel the quiet silence that settled between just the three of them.\n\u2018I\u2019ve never regretted leaving a plane before,\u2019 was all Victor said. Just those soft few words.\nSurprisingly, Yuri remained silent.\nHe remained silent as the queue slowly shuffled forward, as the attendants nodded their polite goodbyes, as they moved in a slow huddle up the aerobridge. It was only as they stepped across into the terminal that he bumped Yuuri\u2019s shoulder and muttered-\n\u2018Katsuki.\u2019\nNot that it mattered. His time left with Victor could now be measured in minutes.\n\u00a0\n\n3 hours and 43 minutes until take-off\n\nTo his surprise, Victor didn\u2019t immediately part ways with him. Yakov set off for the bathroom with the set expression and purposeful walk of a man who both hates aeroplane toilets and has spent many hours in an aeroplane. And after a furious exchange of muttered Russian, Yuri departed too, hitching his backpack up and shooting Victor one last withering glance. Unsure, Yuuri was left standing in awkward silence.\nEventually Victor cleared his throat. \u2018Let\u2019s get something to eat.\u2019\n\u2018Me?\u2019 Yuuri asked. Victor still wanted to stay with him?\n\u2018I was thinking with you, but-\u2019\n\u2018No, okay, sure. Definitely.\u2019\nSomehow Victor\u2019s interest in him felt more real now. They were standing together in the huge echoing terminal, the ceiling metres and metres above with the sunlight streaming in and crowds of people milling amongst the shops. This wasn\u2019t a small, confined cabin. Victor wasn\u2019t assigned to the seat beside him and the quiet, close bubble of shared space was gone. They were together by choice now and Yuuri didn\u2019t know how he felt about that.\nActually, he did know how he felt and it was depressing as hell. His feelings refused to detach themselves from his actions. Every part of Yuuri Katsuki was captivated by Victor Nikiforov. He couldn\u2019t go on with this pretend closeness and pretend it would end the moment he stepped on that next flight, neither his heart or his mind were going to let go that easily. To go on with this flirting wasn\u2019t fair on himself and it wasn\u2019t fair on Victor, who certainly hadn\u2019t signed up to receive the over-attached feelings of a lonely Japanese man and who, unlike Yuuri, would have no trouble moving on from this.\nNo, this ended now.\n\u00a0\n\n3 hours and 31 minutes until take-off\n\nVictor looked older in fluorescents of McDonald\u2019s. Not older in the sense of aged, but taller, his shoulders broader. In the cramped cabin of the plane, Victor\u2019s clothes rumpled, half buried beneath a blanket and sprawled in his seat, it was easier to miss his age and forget who he was. He was all of his twenty-eight years, competent and comfortably self-assured.\nProperly, and with what felt like the first clear thought he\u2019d had in fifteen hours, Yuuri questioned exactly what he\u2019d thought he\u2019d been doing.\nVictor reached behind to rub the back of his neck and Yuuri stared at the muscles of his bare upper-arm. The sleeve of his t-shirt fitted tightly around his arm as he flexed. Unmistakably the result of intense training on the ice. This was a man, almost thirty, with an outstanding career and a proper grip on his life. Yuuri pushed his sundae away, his appetite suddenly gone.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n3 hours and 07 minutes until take-off\n\nHonestly it was probably inevitable and should have been expected, but it was still a shock when Yuri emerged from the shadows like Gollum and cornered Yuuri en-route to the toilet.\n\u2018Yuuri Katsuki. Katsuki Yuuri of Japan.\u2019\nYuuri closed his eyes.\n\u2018You were horrible at the Grand Prix Final free skate. You flubbed everything.\u2019\n\u2018Thanks.\u2019\n\u2018Why?\u2019 Yuri was circling him like a shark. \u2018Your short program was good. Really good.\u2019\nYuuri tried to dodge sideways and Yuri sped up to follow, cutting in front and walking backwards to stare him down. \u2018My dog died.\u2019\n\u2018That sucks.\u2019\n\u2018Yep.\u2019\n\u2018Why haven\u2019t you told Victor? You must have known who he was. He\u2019ll probably wet himself in joy if he finds out you\u2019re a figure skater too.\u2019\nYuuri snorted and tugged his jacket in tighter. \u2018No.\u2019\n\u2018Why not? He\u2019s all over you and you\u2019re into him, right?\u2019\nA group of travellers hurried past, rattling their luggage behind them and Yuuri sidestepped. He stopped to the side of the path and Yuri stood in front of him with his arms crossed and jaw set. \u2018Victor,\u2019 Yuuri glanced over his shoulder and drew closer to Yuri, dropping his voice, \u2018is one of the most decorated figure skaters and he\u2019s won five consecutive GPF gold medals and as you said, I am horrible and I flubbed everything.\u2019\nYuri shrugged. \u2018Doubt he\u2019d care. He\u2019d probably whisk you away to a rink or something and train you with romantic music or some shit.\u2019\nYuuri\u2019s brain short-circuited at that point. He took a brief moment to imagine gliding across the ice in Victor\u2019s arms. And then slammed back down to reality. \u2018It\u2019s only been fifteen hours and we\u2019ve been sat next to each other on a plane,\u2019 he said bluntly.\u00a0 \u2018He\u2019s flirting because he\u2019s bored and I\u2019m interesting because I don\u2019t say much and I go bright red when he touches me, which he does a lot. He probably thinks I\u2019m being mysterious but actually I\u2019m just awkward and anxious.\u2019\nAgain, Yuri shrugged. \u2018He\u2019s sad and lonely and desperate.\u2019\nGreat, so Victor had been flirting with him out of desperation? That just made everything better.\nLeaning in, Yuri looked like he was in physical pain. \u2018He likes you.\u2019 Saying that clearly took a toll on him.\n\u2018It\u2019s been fifteen hours,\u2019 Yuuri felt that maybe wasn\u2019t being made clear enough. \u2018We were assigned seats together on a flight for only fifteen hours. You can\u2019t like someone based on that.\u2019\nSlightly hypocritical perhaps, but he was aware of his over-attachment and his deep loneliness compounded with a sixteen-odd year admiration of Victor Nikiforov and that was his own personal issue to deal with, thank you. And it did not negate the impossibility of Victor or anyone else for that matter developing a true attachment in the space of one international flight.\n\u2018So? You-\u2019\n\u2018He\u2019s met me before, you know,\u2019 Yuuri cut across quietly. \u2018At the Grand Prix last year I skated in the finals with him. After the event he didn\u2019t recognise me, not even right after I\u2019d skated. Then at the airport yesterday he didn\u2019t recognise me.\u2019\n\u2018He\u2019s got a mind like a sieve,\u2019 Yuri said dismissively. \u2018He only remembers the stuff he wants to.\u2019\nYuuri stared. Because obviously. That was his point. Yuri seemed to realise what he\u2019d said and fell silent.\n\u2018Why\u2019d you even talk to him then?\u2019 He asked after a pause. \u2018He was kind of a dick.\u2019\nYuuri searched for a way to say he was flattered? Victor was acknowledging him? Victor was stupidly good looking?\n\u2018Ew,\u2019 Yuri said softly, with feeling.\nApparently his expression had said it all then.\n\u00a0\n\n2 hours and 58 minutes until take-off\n\nYuuri came back from the bathroom to find Victor stealing his fries. He received a brilliant wide grin and not the faintest hint of shame.\n\u2018You were gone a while,\u2019 Victor said, pulling another fry from Yuuri\u2019s packet. \u2018I did what I had to to survive.\u2019\n\u2018I ran into Yuri.\u2019 Yuuri sat down and batted Victor\u2019s hand away. This was too real, too easy. Too much like a friendship. Only it wasn\u2019t because it was all just a short blip. A little blip of companionship in a foreign airport for one day of a year. Yuuri wished that -\nHe drew a deep breath and pushed his chair away from the table. Victor looked at him, startled. \u2018I should probably find my gate. I think it\u2019s in a different terminal.\u2019\nVictor stood up too and Yuuri was again conscious that Victor was taller than him. \u2018I never did ask, where are you connecting on to, if you don\u2019t mind me asking?\u2019\nHe did, but probably not for the reasons Victor was accounting for. He listened with a heavy weight in his stomach as Victor happily confirmed they were travelling on together. At the very least they wouldn\u2019t be seated together - Victor looked at Yuuri\u2019s boarding pass to check - that had been a fluke of incredible proportions.\n\u2018So,\u2019 Yuuri began awkwardly again, \u2018I guess you\u2019ll find Yakov and Yuri now?\u2019\n\u2018I - you\u2019re going now?\u2019\nYuuri shrugged. \u2018I\u2019ll probably get lost, I\u2019ll need the time,\u2019 he tried to joke but Victor\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change.\n\u2018I thought - I mean, you should at least let me get you a drink or something, I was going to make up for eating your fries.\u2019\nNot knowing what to say, and not trusting himself to open his mouth, Yuuri just pulled Victor into a rough hug. Victor made a sound by his ear and pulled him in tight, gripping the back of neck. His fingers dug into Yuuri\u2019s skin and he felt press of Victor\u2019s mouth and nose against the side of his neck. It wasn\u2019t an adequate hug to cover everything Yuuri had felt in the past day. His chest hurt with everything he desperately wanted to say. He clenched his fist in the back of Victor\u2019s t-shirt, closed his eyes and buried his face in Victor\u2019s shoulder. Just for a moment. Telling himself to stop being ridiculous, Yuuri pulled back. Victor caught his hand before it dropped to his side and murmured something in Russian.\nYuuri looked down at the joined hands. \u2018What did you say?\u2019\nVictor shrugged and laughed, a slightly shaky sound. \u2018Come see me in St Petersburg and I\u2019ll tell you.\u2019\n\u2018Maybe one day.\u2019\n\u2018One day,\u2019 Victor echoed. \u2018Well, Yuuri,\u2019 he forced a lighter note into his voice, \u2018it has been an absolute pleasure. I wish you every possible success in your dancing. All flights after this are going to seem very flat by comparison.\u2019\nYuuri wondered if he was the first person Victor had said that too, he doubted it. He also doubted Victor truly would remember him. But for now, at least, Victor did look genuinely regretful. Yuuri echoed similar sentiments. He was too conscious of Victor\u2019s tight grip on his hand. Soon it was going to end.\n\u2018I could give you my number?\u2019 Victor offered, almost half-heartedly, Yuuri felt.\n\u2018Probably not much point.\u2019\n\u2018No, I suppose you\u2019re right.\u2019\nActing on impulse, Yuuri stepped forward and pressed a quick kiss to Victor\u2019s mouth. Victor\u2019s hand squeezed almost painfully hard and he opened his mouth beneath Yuuri\u2019s, stealing a deep, fierce kiss in the brief seconds before Yuuri drew back. Victor\u2019s eyes were still closed when Yuuri stepped away.\n\u2018Goodbye, Victor,\u2019 Yuuri said softly.\n\u00a0\n\nSomething around 2 hours, maybe 1, who cares\n\nKnees drawn up to his chest, Yuuri sat on a chair outside the gate and wallowed. He had the music in headphones up loud in an attempt to drown out his thoughts. What had he done? Why had he ever thought this was something he could handle? The B gate was almost full of people waiting, as was the A gate area further down. That\u2019s probably where Victor would be boarding from, the first class and business passengers boarding a different part of the plane. A few people had given Yuuri curious glances as he sat there, the embodiment of misery. He wasn\u2019t sure if he wanted to laugh or cry. It was an utterly ridiculous situation and yet, he still felt completely wretched. What an idiot he\u2019d been. Getting this attached to someone who didn\u2019t even recognise his face. He could pretend to be interesting and funny and brave for a single flight, but that wasn\u2019t really him. The real Yuuri was the one that panicked in a bathroom and skated a disaster of an event and hadn\u2019t even kissed someone before. That was the Yuuri that Victor hadn\u2019t cared enough about to remember. Who\u2019d he thought he was fooling? Himself, more than anyone else probably.\nYuuri added anger at himself to the list of emotions he was currently feeling.\nIt was in state of anger, frustration, regret, anxiety and sadness that Yuuri boarded the plane. He spared a brief thought for the person who\u2019d be sitting next to him for this leg. He hoped they wouldn\u2019t want to talk, he felt capable only of yelling and crying. Possibly both at the same time.\nYuuri thumped down in his seat and closed his eyes. Seat 49D. Finally the aisle seat he\u2019d wanted from the start. He squeezed his eyes closed a little tighter. Bleak internal humour was only getting him so far. He pressed his hand over his face and tried not to feel so stupid.\n\u2018So it turns out, I don\u2019t like goodbyes.\u2019\nYuuri\u2019s eyes snapped open. He dropped his hand and slowly forced his stare upwards. Into Victor\u2019s grinning face. Of course.\n\u2018You\u2019re supposed to be in first class,\u2019 Yuuri said dully.\n\u2018It\u2019s amazing how happy people are to swap their economy seat for a first class one.\u2019\n\u2018Oh.\u2019\nSomething changed in Victor\u2019s happy expression. \u2018You\u2019re not as happy to see me as I thought you\u2019d be.\u2019 It was almost a question.\nYuuri was all too aware that he smelled bad, his hair was both messy and greasy, and his clothes looked exactly like he\u2019d spent the last eighteen hours sat in them. Combined with the painful disaster that was his heart, he felt entirely unable to handle this. \u2018I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d see you again.\u2019\n\u2018And you\u2019re not happy to be proven wrong?\u2019 Victor cocked his head. \u2018Strange.\u2019\nWith a hard lump in his throat, Yuuri watched as Victor shoved his bag up into the overhead locker. He couldn\u2019t do another eight hours. There was something hopeful in Victor\u2019s expression when he looked down, he reached for Yuuri\u2019s shoulder and Yuuri flinched away.\nNow Victor truly looked confused. He still shuffled his way past Yuuri to his seat, dropping down beside him and shooting him a sidelong glance. \u2018Everything okay?\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m not sure I can do this,\u2019 Yuuri said in a moment of aching honesty that he immediately regretted.\n\u2018Sit next to me?\u2019\n\u2018No, I-\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019re a mystery, Yuuri. You notice my flirting, you respond in what I feel was a very positive manner, and then with eight hours left of this flight we must stop talking? I think I have missed something.\u2019\n\u2018Does it matter? As you said, there\u2019s only eight hours left.\u2019\nShrugging, Victor plugged his headphones into the jack. \u2018It\u2019ll bother me long after the eight hours if I don\u2019t find out.\u2019\n\u2018No it won\u2019t,\u2019 Yuuri said firmly. Victor looked up curiously at the force in his voice. Flushing in a mix of frustration and shame, he stared out into the aisle.\n\u2018And I say it will.\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019ll return home and if you want quick, meaningless distractions you\u2019ll find them easy enough. It\u2019s been proven in the past that I am not a particularly memorable person.\u2019\nVictor abandoned any attempt to arrange his headphones and blankets and stared seriously at Yuuri instead. It was the most serious he had ever seen him. \u2018What makes you say that?\u2019\nYuuri flashed him a quick, regretful smile before staring back down at his feet. \u2018You\u2019re very good looking. And charming.\u2019\n\u2018No, why do you think you\u2019re not mem-\u2019 he broke off as the flight attendant stopped by their seats, offering a tray of hot towels. Yuuri seized one and pressed it to his face.\n\u2018For reasons of my own, I think flirting with you was a mistake,\u2019 Yuuri said into the hot towel while he still had the courage, \u2018and I think it would be best if we parted ways.\u2019\n\u2018And I won\u2019t argue you from that decision, but if you feel this strongly, why did you kiss me?\u2019 Victor just sounded puzzled.\nYuuri closed his eyes. \u2018I felt flattered,\u2019 he confessed and felt utterly, completely stupid. \u2018It was flattering to think you would be interested in me.\u2019\nYuuri felt a soft, fleeting touch to his wrist. \u2018You\u2019re quite attractive, Yuuri,\u2019 Victor said. \u2018I promise I would notice you anywhere.\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s the boredom talking.\u2019\nWith a frustrated noise, Victor settled back in his seat. \u2018And I feel like now you\u2019re just self-flagellating.\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s not you, it\u2019s-\u2019\n\u2018No, of course,\u2019 Victor said sarcastically, \u2018you had such a fun time with me that you dread the prospect of spending more time in my presence.\u2019\nNever, not in a million years, would Yuuri have expected Victor to react like this. He seemed genuinely upset. Yuuri didn\u2019t understand, it was only eight hours. Surely Victor could have just watched movies to pass the time? Did he really need someone else as a distraction?\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n8 hours and 04 minutes until landing\n\n\u00a0\n\n7 hours and 37 minutes\n\nIt was uncomfortable.\nAnd that was a mild assessment of the situation. Yuuri found himself staring out across the aisle, pretending he couldn\u2019t feel Victor\u2019s gaze burning the side of his face. It was all so pointless. What good would come of telling Victor his reasons for withdrawing? Nothing. No good would come of it. He could either endure eight hours of Victor\u2019s confusion or eight hours of excruciating awkwardness when Victor realised how he felt. It wasn\u2019t a difficult decision.\nThe seatbelt sign switched off with a faint ping and gradually the sound of voices and conversation grew, people shifting and stretching in their seats, stepping into the aisles and clicking open the overhead lockers. Yuuri tried to resist the temptation to slide his gaze sideways, subtly glance at Victor, map the way his hair fell over his forehead and brushed the bridge of his nose, almost a little too long and a little too messy compared to his usual cut.\nIt was an afterthought to realise he had not in fact resisted temptation and had been staring at Victor for a solid few seconds. Probably with an embarrassing amount of longing on his face. Victor was slouched in his seat, elbows resting on both arm-rests and his phone held up. One leg was kicked out under the seat in front to complete the image of effortless, graceful boredom.\n\u2018You\u2019re looking at me,\u2019 Victor noted. He swiped upwards on his phone with unnecessary force.\nYuuri couldn\u2019t help tracing his eyes over Victor\u2019s features, over the sharp line of his nose and the unhappy press of his lips. He looked away regretfully.\n\u2018Didn\u2019t say you had to stop,\u2019 Victor added with a certain sharpness, eyes still fixed on his phone screen.\nThere wasn\u2019t any reply Yuuri could give. Of course he didn\u2019t want to look away, who would? But it was easier to stare out into the aisle. The plain blue carpet of the aisle floor didn\u2019t leave him tangled in guilt and longing. He pretended not to hear the short, frustrated snort from beside him. What he really wanted right now was a drink. Maybe four. And what he didn\u2019t want was to see a familiar pair of leopard print sneakers approaching down the aisle. There was only one person that thought leopard print was the final word in cool. Yuuri lifted his eyes and closed his mouth, cutting himself off with a heavy sigh. Yuri Plisetsky. Just what he needed, more Russian figure skaters crowding around his seat.\nYuuri raised his hand slightly in greeting and was completely ignored. Yuri stopped by Yuuri\u2019s seat and waited in silence. No one said anything.\nYuri looked between them. \u2018Okay, so you told him. This looks awkward as shit. You\u2019re right, probably should have waited.\u2019 That last part was directed at Yuuri. \u2018Dick move though.\u2019 That went to Victor.\nVictor grabbed the seat in front and wrenched himself forward. \u2018What?\u2019 He stared at Yuri, then back to Yuuri. \u2018What was a dick move? So I did do something? I said something?\u2019 He looked back at Yuri. \u2018Will someone just tell me what I did?\u2019\n\u2018No, I didn\u2019t tell him,\u2019 Yuuri said flatly.\nIt took two seconds of silent staring at their faces for Yuri to decide this was not a discussion he wished to be part of. He turned abruptly and left.\n\u2018Excuse me,\u2019 Victor muttered and hastily pulled himself out of the row.\nThe last Yuuri saw was Yuri hurrying up the aisle, Victor close behind and accelerating fast.\n\u00a0\n\n7 hours and 31 minutes to go\n\nBetween Victor disappearing and returning with a frustrated expression, Yuuri had six glorious minutes to imagine every possible way Yuri could be spilling his secret. Right now he was probably telling Victor everything. Yuuri let out a slow, deliberate breath and tried not to squeeze his phone between his hands. His sweaty hands. Victor was probably laughing, he\u2019d be angry, probably repulsed, feeling pity for the terrible skater with a ridiculous crush, trying to swap his seat away from -\n\u2018Nothing,\u2019 Victor said as he dropped down into his seat. \u2018Whatever your reasons are, Yuri has kept them to himself.\u2019\nSeeing the confusion and hurt on Victor\u2019s face, Yuuri couldn\u2019t quite bring himself to feel relieved. He released his death grip on his phone and instead felt guilty.\n\u00a0\n\n7 hours and 29 minutes\n\n\u2018Vodka, please,\u2019 Victor said quite firmly.\nYuuri looked at the firm press of his lips. Seven and a half hours to go. He looked back at the flight attendant. \u2018Yes. Vodka, please.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\n7 hours and 02 minutes\n\nLegs stretched out under the seat in front and slouched down, Victor stared down at his feet. His expression reminded Yuuri of the time Mari and Minako had commandeered the tv to watch Pride and Prejudice and Mr Darcy brooded in the corner of the room for six straight hours.\n\u2018So,\u2019 Victor said finally, speaking to his feet, \u2018are we going to speak at all during this flight?\u2019\n\u2018No,\u2019 Yuuri said with the bluntness of two little vodka bottles.\n\u2018Is anyone going to tell me why, or shall I just assume this is irreparably my fault?\u2019 And evidently vodka was bringing out a flair for the dramatic in Victor.\nRunning his hands through his hair, Yuuri noted, a little distantly, that his skin felt unpleasantly numb. Probably best not to have any more alcohol. He\u2019d stop. After one more. \u2018I could have avoided this.\u2019\n\u2018Avoided what?\u2019\nYuuri remained silent and Victor thumped his head back against the seat in frustration.\n\u2018My mysterious seatmate,\u2019 Victor said with a biting, sarcastic sweep to his voice, \u2018humour me. Tell me what I could have done to earn this reaction.\u2019\nYuuri flagged down an attendant. He was going to need that final drink sooner than later. \u2018Do you really need to have this conversation with someone you\u2019ve known for less than a day?\u2019 Victor fell silent. Yuuri finished speaking to the flight attendant and turned around to Victor. \u2018Do you want a drink?\u2019\n\u2018Make it five,\u2019 Victor said wearily.\n\u2018He\u2019ll have one too,\u2019 Yuuri confirmed to the flight attendant. His arms felt heavy and harder to control than usual. He rolled his head sideways to stare at Victor. \u2018Most people would chalk this whole thing up to a weird plane encounter, right? Why do you care?\u2019\nVictor\u2019s small, bitter smile was not what he expected. \u2018Too much? I came on too strong?\u2019 He groaned faintly and rubbed his hand over his face, slumping further in the seat. Letting his hand drop, he stared at the floor with a strange self-deprecating expression. \u2018Is that it? Were you hinting for me to back off?\u2019\n\u2018No,\u2019 Yuuri said heavily, \u2018no, I wasn\u2019t.\u2019\nVictor accepted another mini vodka bottle from the flight attendant, immediately taking a long drink while looking at Yuuri with a skeptical raised eyebrow. Why did he have to be so attractive? Yuuri stared down at his drink and then downed half in one go. His head buzzed.\n\u2018Vi-\u2019\n\u2018And then I sat next to you.\u2019 Victor wiped his hand over his mouth. \u2018God, you\u2019re right, way too much. You should have j-\u2019\n\u2018I know who -\u2019\n\u2018No,\u2019 Victor said firmly. He closed his eyes and shoved his hands through his hair, tipping his head backwards. Yuuri stared longingly at his collarbone. \u2018I\u2019m going to be honest. Can I be honest?\u2019\nWell it was about time one of them was. His confession hovering on the tip of his tongue, Yuuri just nodded wordlessly.\n\u2018I\u2019m confused, Yuuri.\u2019 Victor let his hands drop, perhaps a shade dramatically, but there was a strange cast to his face. His left hand fell palm-up on their shared arm rest and Yuuri found himself fighting the urge to just reach out and take it. \u2018We had such fun the last few hours, didn\u2019t we? Then something changed. You tell me my attention wasn\u2019t unwelcome and it wasn\u2019t too much?\u2019 He caught Yuuri\u2019s eye as if to check, his expression a little anxious. It was a strange expression on him. \u2018And you\u2019re right that I shouldn\u2019t care about a stranger met once on a flight. But-\u2019 his expression twisted, a little regretful, a little bitter perhaps, \u2018for reasons of my own,\u2019 he echoed Yuuri\u2019s words back to him pointedly, \u2018that is how I feel, and I care about a stranger\u2019s opinion of me. Tell me to drop this and I\u2019ll watch Meg Ryan romantic-comedies for the rest of the flight and leave you alone, otherwise\u2026\u2019 he trailed off hopefully.\nFeeling entirely incapable of answering that directly, Yuuri deflected. \u2018What reasons do you have for caring about my opinion of you?\u2019\nVictor raised his eyebrow again and snorted faintly. \u2018Ah, you have not drunk nearly enough vodka to unlock that question.\u2019\nAlcohol buzzed through his body and Yuuri gazed at Victor\u2019s unfairly gorgeous face. \u2018Tell me, and I\u2019ll tell you something.\u2019\nSome of the familiar teasing humour came back into Victor\u2019s eyes. \u2018A game?\u2019\n\u2018With alcohol.\u2019 Yuuri said firmly. Please.\n\u2018If you\u2019re trying to drink me into honesty, I should warn you I am Russian.\u2019\n\u2018And I am a lightweight, so you\u2019ll have no trouble. I\u2019m going first.\u2019\nVictor inclined his head.\n\u2018Why do you care what I think of you?\u2019\nVictor laughed and shook his head. \u2018Too big a question. You\u2019re going to have to build up to that, Yuuri.\u2019 Victor with alcohol in his system seemed to enjoy saying Yuuri\u2019s name more frequently, lingering and drawing out the vowel sounds. \u2018You forfeit your question. My turn. Would you have flirted with me if I hadn\u2019t started?\u2019\n\u2018Please, I\u2019m quiet and have anxiety. But,\u2019 Yuuri continued because vodka, \u2018I\u2019d have wanted to. Why did you flirt with me?\u2019\nVictor shrugged easily. \u2018Because you\u2019re hot.\u2019\nThe momentary silence shattered as they both laughed, Yuuri\u2019s laugh an embarrassed, incredulous sound and Victor\u2019s just open honesty.\n\u2018Do you think I\u2019m hot?\u2019\nFace turning red, Yuuri muttered, \u2018You know the answer to that question already. Have you flirted with someone on a flight before?\u2019\n\u2018No. Did I do something to make you feel awkward this flight?\u2019\nA different tone crept between their words, more serious beneath the smiles. \u2018No. Will you remember me when this is over and you\u2019ve gone home?\u2019\nVictor\u2019s fingers touched the back of Yuuri\u2019s hand, almost light enough to be unnoticeable. \u2018Yes. Will you think of me?\u2019\nYuuri flexed his fingers and slid them up between Victor\u2019s, his breath catching as Victor squeezed tightly over the back of his hand. \u2018Of course.\u2019\n\u2018Of course?\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019re hot,\u2019 Yuuri echoed Victor\u2019s words and they grinned, but their smiles faded just a little too fast.\n\u2018Ask me why I care,\u2019 Victor said quietly.\n\u2018Why do you care, Victor?\u2019\nVictor didn\u2019t lift his eyes from their joined hands and Yuuri gazed down at the fan of his white-blonde eyelashes. \u2018Very few people know me outside of skating. I spend most of my time training at the rink by myself, with my coach, with a couple of other skaters, and there isn\u2019t much time for anything else. When I meet people it\u2019s usually through skating and everyone already knows who I am. Everyone already has an idea of what I will be like and the sort of person I am.\u2019\nGuilt curled in Yuuri\u2019s chest as Victor continued.\n\u2018You were the first person I\u2019ve spoken to for a while that didn\u2019t have any expectations. You weren\u2019t comparing me to anything you thought I should be. And you seemed to like me, until you didn\u2019t. And I suppose,\u2019 Victor absently played with their hands, rubbing his thumb back and forth, \u2018I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019m - too much? Too annoying - maybe I\u2019m not that likable?\u2019\nHe glanced up at Yuuri\u2019s face and broke into a rueful smile. He muttered something in Russian and sat up straighter, squeezing Yuuri\u2019s hand. \u2018That was enough drama for the flight,\u2019 he forced his voice louder. \u2018More vodka, I think.\u2019\n\u2018Victor,\u2019 Yuuri couldn\u2019t keep the heavy regret from his voice.\nVictor downed the rest of his drink. His expression had a forced brightness to it, smile in place, but Yuuri knew what he was going to ask now. He tugged his hand free, it didn\u2019t feel right doing this with his hand in Victor\u2019s. He didn\u2019t miss the sadness and acknowledgement that flashed across Victor\u2019s face. This wasn\u2019t fair.\n\u2018Well, that answers m-\u2019\n\u2018No,\u2019 Yuuri cut him off. \u2018I think you\u2019re extremely likable. It\u2019s just,\u2019 he squeezed his hands over his thighs, \u2018I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll like me that much now.\u2019 His heart was in his throat. \u2018See, I knew who you were, five time champion men\u2019s figure skater.\u2019\nShock set heavily over Victor\u2019s face. Never one to hide his emotions, in this moment it was a little heartbreaking.\n\u2018I didn\u2019t want to make it awkward,\u2019 Yuuri continued quietly. \u2018I thought you\u2019d ignore me.\u2019\nHe paused for Victor to say something, he didn\u2019t.\n\u2018I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d keep talking to me. When you did it was - it was too late to say anything.\u2019\n\u2018So,\u2019 Victor said eventually. It was a very final sounding so. \u2018You knew who I was?\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\u2018And you lied.\u2019\nYuuri\u2019s heart sank. He told himself it was the reaction he expected, he knew this was coming. \u2018Yes.\u2019\n\u2018You sat there listening as I told you how I felt, about skating, about myself and and you said nothing?\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\u2018Why?\u2019 It burst out, angry and loud. A few heads turned curiously in their direction and Yuuri sank in his seat. He couldn\u2019t bring himself to look at Victor anymore. He felt capable of nothing more than whispering yes. \u2018Are you a fan?\u2019\nYuuri inclined his head in a half nod. He kept his face down. He heard Victor\u2019s frustrated groan.\n\u2018You knew I would never have told you anything if I had known, didn\u2019t you?\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\u2018So everything I said - I thought-\u2019 Victor\u2019s face twisted. \u2018When I thought-\u2019 again he broke off with a bitter curl to his mouth.\nEars ringing, Yuuri stared fixedly at the screen in front and swallowed thickly. He wanted to open his mouth and explain - this wasn\u2019t it, it wasn\u2019t what he thought - but his throat was clenched too tight. Beside him Victor was still and silent.\n\u2018Fine,\u2019 Victor continued finally, his voice was too quiet and flat. \u2018Post, write, blog what you will online - did you take pictures of me too? - I don\u2019t care.\u2019\nA couple wandered down the aisle past Yuuri, footsteps muffled on the carpet and voices quiet for each other. He caught the grins they flashed each other between words and the embarrassed smile on the man\u2019s face as he dipped his head, the woman glancing back at him with amused fondness.\n\u2018That\u2019s what you\u2019re telling me, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 Victor kept talking, he wished he\u2019d stop, he wished it was just over. The man reached forward gently to the girl and their finger tips brushed, a quiet, subtle touch as they passed Yuuri\u2019s seat. \u2018You only spoke to me because of my skating?\u2019\nYuuri shook his head gently, drawing a steadying breath before he could speak. \u2018No,\u2019 he managed to say clearly.\n\u2018Then why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u2019 Victor grew louder and sharper, words falling out faster. \u2018You lied! Why would you do that? That\u2019s why you didn\u2019t want me sitting here, you felt guilty, didn\u2019t you? You know, I think you\u2019re right. I think I will forget you very quickly.\u2019\nYuuri closed his eyes tightly. A hot tear slid down his cheek.\n\u2018It wasn\u2019t that great a kiss. Any of them, really. You did fine as a distraction. Tell me, what did you hope to get out of this? Did you think it would mea-\u2019\nHe bent his head as his face crumpled. For a moment he sat there, eyes squeezed shut and head hanging as he cried. His shoulders shook and he covered his face with one hand, choking back as he tried to stay silent. It hurt. It was ridiculous how much it hurt.\nVictor had stopped speaking. Of course he had been a distraction. Of course he was forgettable, he knew this.\nIt was just -\n\u2018Yuuri-\u2019\n\u2018I know,\u2019 Yuuri choked angrily, surprising himself. \u2018Y-you\u2019ve ma-\u2019 his voice shook and broke, \u2018-made your point clear. I\u2019m stu-\u2019 he cracked on the last word, breaking to a whisper, \u2018-stupid.\u2019\nAnd he felt it. Utterly, entirely stupid. His chest ached with it and the rejection he told himself he had expected. Of course Victor was angry, it made sense. He knew this mess of a meeting with Victor wasn\u2019t worth what he was feeling, rationally he knew that, it was just no one seemed to have told his heart.\n\u2018You\u2019re upset.\u2019\nYuuri kept his face buried in his hand, glasses dangling from his fingers. He sensed Victor shifting and then stilling in the seat beside him. It was as though a heavy blanket had been laid over his body, everything felt slow and distant, the skin of his face beneath his palm was at once both wet and numb, his hearing buzzing. Another warm tear trickled slowly down the backs of his fingers. Perhaps he wouldn\u2019t have reacted like this if he hadn\u2019t had something, many to drink, but perhaps it would have felt even worse. He wanted to think that the harshness and quick anger in Victor was fuelled by the three, four, something vodkas he had so far had, however he doubted it.\n\u2018Of course I\u2019m upset,\u2019 Yuuri said finally with more honesty than intended. \u2018I can hold your hand, touch your face,\u2019 his voice got quieter as his cheeks turned red, \u2018kiss you. And you don\u2019t care at all.\u2019\nHe rather felt Victor\u2019s silence said everything. Face burning, Yuuri dug his fingertips into his forehead.\n\u2018You said I-\u2019 he couldn\u2019t bring himself to repeat what Victor had said about kissing him.\nStill the silence. It was true then.\n\u2018I - I haven\u2019t really kissed many people - anyone. Before you. Sorry.\u2019 God, someone stop him talking. He shoved himself to his feet, fumbling hurriedly with his glasses and grabbing for his bag. He drew in a deep, shuddering breath and looked anywhere but at Victor.\n\u00a0\n\n6 hours and 41 minutes\n\nYuuri sat on the toilet lid and cried, big, pointless tears that splatted down his cheeks and puddled messily around his nose.\n\u00a0\n\n6 hours and 11 minutes\n\nThings went downhill from there. Surprisingly there were actually further depths to which this disaster could sink. It was amazing what could be accomplished with mini pocket-sized vodka and a generous serving of wine and crippling misery.\nDinner came and there was no teasing, no laughter as Victor peered over his shoulder, nothing, just a plain foil wrapped meal sitting on the table. Eating was the last thing Yuuri felt like doing. He tucked his hands under his arms and leaned his cheek against the headrest, staring blankly out into the cabin. The plane droned in the background and matched the empty buzz he felt inside his head.\nVictor reached over and pulled the foil off Yuuri\u2019s tray in one quick rip. \u2018Eat your dinner,\u2019 he said wearily. \u2018I\u2019m really not worth it.\u2019\nYuuri glanced down at bland vegetables and felt, if possible, even less interested than before. Where earlier he had been an equal with Victor, he now felt the difference in the way he spoke and acted. He was no longer Yuuri, stranger on a plane, he was Yuuri, a Fan. An immature, idiot fan. He reached out and quite firmly placed the foil back on top of the tray. One of the trays. He placed it firmly somewhere in the vicinity of a tray. It was surprisingly difficult moving arms that felt like they\u2019d been weighted to his side.\n\u2018Wish I\u2019d never met you,\u2019 Yuuri confessed with easy bluntness.\n\u2018You didn\u2019t hit on me, I know that came from me.\u2019 Victor\u2019s voice had lost some of its harsh edge. \u2018Perhaps it was an awkward situation from the start.\u2019\nVictor thought he was an obsessed lying stalker, awkward was an understatement. Only when Victor blinked did Yuuri realise he\u2019d said that out loud. Definitely another drink. Yuuri firmly pressed the call button. If he could spend the rest of this flight unconscious that would be fantastic.\n\u2018That isn\u2019t how it is?\u2019 For a moment Victor\u2019s voice was achingly sad. \u2018Wouldn\u2019t be the first time someone tried.\u2019\n\u2018You think I wanted this?\u2019 Yuuri demanded incredulously. \u2018You think I wasn\u2019t wishing you\u2019d just walk past me? That you\u2019d sit somewhere else? You\u2019d sleep the whole flight, you\u2019d leave at Dubai? I am awkward. I am anxious. You think I\u2019m not painfully aware how terrible a flirt I\u2019d make? I am well aware I would be a poor distraction and I am so stupid because because I thought, just for a moment, that I was something someone would want. Thank you for confirming how forgettable I am!\u2019 Yuuri finished his furiously whispered speech with a sharp, shuddering breath. He wiped his hand roughly under his nose.\nVictor\u2019s still expression and reddening cheeks just made anger burn even hotter in Yuuri\u2019s chest. Victor cleared his throat, once, twice. He looked down and swallowed. \u2018Unfortunately,\u2019 he said far too quietly, \u2018you are not particularly forgettable.\u2019\nYuuri barked an ugly laugh. \u2018Right. Of course. That\u2019s exactly what you said before.\u2019\n\u2018I was angry,\u2019 Victor said simply.\n\u2018No you were being honest. You think this is the first time you\u2019ve seen me?\u2019 Yuuri was setting himself on fire along with Victor and he didn\u2019t care. \u2018Twice.\u2019 A hot tear splashed down Yuuri\u2019s cheek and he swiped it away roughly. \u2018You\u2019ve seen me twice before. You watched me, you met me, you spoke to me and you forgot me, so you can save your lines and your pointless lies for someone else.\u2019\n\u2018Do you have any idea how many people I meet? How many pictures I take and autographs I sign?\u2019\n\u2018You sound so arrog-\u2019\n\u2018Don\u2019t twist my words.\u2019\n\u00a0\u2018Don\u2019t need to,\u2019 Yuuri said bitterly. He fumbled impatiently for a tissue, jamming his hand in his pocket and swaying with the effort of holding his head up. If he was prepared to be honest with himself, which he wasn\u2019t, he might have acknowledged that a large portion of his frustration was directed inwards. He knew it was nothing, it was a casual flirtation, he knew Victor would be angry if he revealed as a fan, he knew all of these things and still he had let it happen. It would seem however that there was a difference between knowing he was a meaningless fling and actually feeling it. Shame coiled heavy in his chest and prickled behind his eyes, kept distant and just out of reach by the buzz of alcohol through his body.\nFace red, Yuuri squeezed his eyes shut and dug in his other pocket for the tissues. No tissue. Just Victor\u2019s extremely unwelcome presence in the seat over. Grabbing the armrest, he heaved himself to his feet. He barely registered Victor\u2019s movements, a hand near his elbow -\n\u2018Yuu-\u2019\n\u2018Don\u2019t-\u2019 the sudden anger in his voice surprised them both, Yuuri lowered his hand and exhaled, \u2018-touch me.\u2019\nThe clunk of the overhead bin was at once both a distant and loud sound, Yuuri didn\u2019t bother to wonder why that might be. He braced one hand on the edge of the locker and yanked his bag down. It smacked down onto the ground at his feet. He stared down at it in silence.\n\u2018I\u2019m-\u2019 He could feel the slur in his words. Touching his fingers to his face, Yuuri vaguely noted they felt numb.\n\u00a0\n\n?\n\nHe was in the toilet again. Sat on the toilet lid. Yuuri swayed sideways and fixed his gaze down - toilet lid. He could see he was sat on that. He gave it a careful pat to make sure.\nHe was eventually going to have to come out of the toilet, he accepted that on a vague level. The only real problem was he couldn\u2019t be entirely sure exactly, precisely how long he\u2019d already been in there. Here. He sighed and slumped backwards. It felt like he leaned backwards for a long time before his back eventually hit the wall and he sank limply downwards.\nHad he spoken to Victor recently? After standing up? Maybe he had sat back down. He accepted that that would have been a bad thing to do but he couldn\u2019t make himself feel the emotions attached to that thought.\nVictor was gorgeous. He liked Victor. It hurt that Victor didn\u2019t like him. Yuuri reached out and ran his fingertip slowly along the wall, staring unblinkingly at it. He let his finger drop to the edge of the basin, hanging there by the tip. He\u2019d messed this up. Victor hadn\u2019t remembered him, he should have just said so.\nBut that was embarrassing. Nicer to be interesting and attractive. Real him wasn\u2019t those things. Yuuri slowly pulled his finger from the sink and dropped his arm to his side. Shouldn\u2019t have said anything.\nThe plane engines hummed in a low, constant vibration. Sat under the bright yellow light, Yuuri felt his eyes drifting closed.\n\u00a0\n\n?????\n\nWith a sharp intake of breath Yuuri opened his eyes. His heart pounded in his ears. Toilet.\nHe was on his feet. He staggered sideways and slammed his shoulder into the door. It didn\u2019t hurt. Probably should have. The room spun dangerously but he remained on his feet, eyes half closed and head hanging. The plane shuddered and Yuuri braced his palms on the walls.\nOut the door.\nTaking careful, small steps, Yuuri slowly picked his way down the aisle. His eyes were probably too wide. It was the best he could do. That or half-shut. He was too aware of his face. Was his expression normal? Nothing felt right. At least the cabin lights were dimmed. Even if it did make it hard to see in the dizzying blur of dark shapes.\nAlso, where were his glasses?\nPatting over his face and head for his glasses, Yuuri heaved himself sideways into his seat. Fell. Victor wasn\u2019t there. That was good. He hauled his legs up onto Victor\u2019s seat. Ridiculous attractive Victor. Yuuri shuffled his body down across the two seats and grabbed for a blanket. He\u2019d sleep here until they landed.\n\u00a0\n\nProbably 5 hours\n\nYuuri woke up at some indeterminate point. Not properly awake, rather the heavy, distant sense of awareness that comes on the edge of sleep. The plane was a constant drone drowning out his senses and he remained still in his seat, curled up warm and heavy beneath the blanket. Something had woken him up. He was dimly conscious of someone standing beside him in the aisle.\nHalf asleep and with his glasses off, Victor\u2019s face was blurred at the edges. Yuuri stirred faintly and blinked once.\n\u2018Victor?\u2019 He mumbled, mouth dry and voice hoarse.\nMaybe he imagined it, maybe he was still dreaming, but it seemed like Victor looked sad. There could have been the faint pressure of a hand on his shoulder, just for a moment.\nBut he was probably dreaming.\n\u00a0\n\n2 hours and 39 minutes\n\nHis mouth was dry. Yuuri swallowed around the sandpaper in his throat and cracked open his eyes, staring up at the blurred ceiling. The dark seatbelt sign spun gently and shifted out of focus. He was\u2026 Blinking and swallowing around a dizzying wave of nausea, Yuuri lifted his head. He was lying down on his back. With his legs draped half over Victor\u2019s lap.\n\u2018How are you feeling?\u2019 Victor was staring down at him, his expression unreadable.\n\u2018Awful,\u2019 Yuuri said hoarsely. He didn\u2019t move.\nVictor lifted his hand from Yuuri\u2019s knee and pulled a pair of glasses from his collar. \u2018Yours,\u2019 he handed them back, their fingers brushing as Yuuri silently accepted them. \u2018You were really quite insistent that I take them.\u2019\n\u2018So I - I spoke to you.\u2019\n\u2018You had a lot to say.\u2019\nExpecting anger, expecting derision in Victor\u2019s face, and with defiance building in his throat, Yuuri lifted his eyes to Victor\u2019s. In the dim cabin light, Victor held his gaze in silence.\n\u2018About?\u2019 Oh, did he even want to know?\u2019\n\u2018My abilities as a skater, my failings as a human being.\u2019\nVictor\u2019s face was set strangely, his pressed and his eyes a little too bright. Bristling with humiliation, hurt, and uncertainty, Yuuri glared back.\n\u2018Also,\u2019 Victor\u2019s voice had an uneven break, \u2018some insight into your current feelings towards myself.\u2019\nObviously Yuuri had sobered up too soon. He was now going to have to lock himself back in the toilet, where he would remain until landing. In the grips of utter horror, Yuuri felt himself rising to his feet and turning instinctively towards the toilets.\n\u2018Yuuri. Please,\u2019 the words caught oddly as Victor spoke, \u2018wi-\u2019 he cut himself off abruptly and looked down. His hand touched Yuuri\u2019s seat in a silent request.\nUnsure and with a long moment of hesitation, Yuuri slipped down into the seat. His fingers gripped white on the armrest. Had he spoke about his own skating?\n\u2018I would have liked,\u2019 Victor spoke quietly, almost as if he was unsure of his ability to say the words, \u2018to have been liked for myself. Not some pointless, idolised version.\u2019 He caught Yuuri\u2019s eye. \u2018Does that explain something of why I was upset?\u2019\nRigid in deep, unspeakable awkwardness, Yuuri just nodded. He needed copious amounts of hard spirits to discuss his emotions but apparently Victor had no such inhibitions. There was no way for this to end well. Surely they could just ignore each other and he would simply regret every single action that had led to being on this flight?\n\u2018Is your hoodie wet?\u2019 Yuuri asked suddenly.\n\u2018Ah.\u2019 Victor touched the front of his top. \u2018Yes. An accident with water.\u2019\nYuuri stared in growing dread. Surely not - \u2018Was that - did I -\u2019\n\u2018I tried to give you a cup, you refused quite firmly.\u2019\nNo amount of shadow would have been enough to hide the horror on Yuuri\u2019s face. \u2018Victor, I am so s-\u2019\n\u2018My fault. I dropped it. Even Russians have an upper limit on vodka.\u2019\nNot entirely sure he believed Victor, Yuuri stared awkwardly. He wasn\u2019t sure what to say. He wasn\u2019t sure what he had said and that was the heavy, pressing problem. He could see in Victor\u2019s face that something had changed, the anger was gone and replaced by a quieter regret and sadness. Was it sadness? What had he said? He\u2019d insulted him, unburdened his feelings,\u00a0 and flung water on him? In the cold clarity of horror, Yuuri could acknowledge that Victor had really done nothing wrong. He knew Victor wouldn\u2019t want to hear he was a fan, that he had been hiding it, of course he would feel upset at the lies. But why was he upset?\nYuuri bent and rummaged quickly through his bag. He sat up with his sweater in hand, face flushed and hair flopped over his eyes. Victor blinked and looked away.\n\u2018Here.\u2019 Yuuri held out his sweater.\nVictor stared in silence.\nWrung out and exhausted, Yuuri was suddenly too tired to do this. \u2018You\u2019re going to spend the next five hours in that top?\u2019\nMaybe Victor saw something of that in his face. Maybe he felt the same. He hesitated, then accepted the sweater. \u2018It\u2019d have dried in two.\u2019\n\u2018Oh, two hours? Well in that case I\u2019ll have my sweater back, thanks.\u2019 It was an automatic, unthinking response and he heard Victor chuckle.\nIn the dark cabin, a faint light caught in Victor\u2019s eyes as he looked across at Yuuri, almost asking permission for the smile still curving his lips. It was too easy to smile that same tentative smile back.\nIt had been a day of belated realisations. Staring into Victor\u2019s soft expression, Yuuri realised something else.\nDespite the lies, and the betrayal Victor said he felt, he was gazing at Yuuri with a sad, regretful sort of fondness. Or perhaps it was quiet longing. It was in the tilt of his lips and the creases to the side of his eyes. There was unmistakably fondness.\nHow could anyone come to care in just one day? It wasn\u2019t logical.\n\u2018You should change your top,\u2019 Yuuri said finally, at a loss for anything else to say. He didn\u2019t know what he wanted to feel, what it made sense to think. Victor Nikiforov felt something for him. He\u2019d made someone care. Victor.\nAt no point in his fleeting fantasies had he imagined Victor might share something of his ill-advised, illogical affection. Regardless of some of the more exotic twists his imagination had taken, every pictured scenario for this flight had ended with farewelling Victor at the gates. Victor would would be charming and amusing, maybe a kiss would be stolen, but ultimately he would walk away without a backwards glance. Yuuri was now facing the possibility that Victor might be at least half as reluctant to part as he himself was. Surely it just had to be the novelty of meeting someone outside of skating, as untrue as that might have later turned out to be. Surely that was the reason for Victor\u2019s attachment?\nVictor held Yuuri\u2019s sweater and glanced out across the cabin. Everyone was still and quiet beneath their blankets, slumped against the shoulders of family and friends. Without any sense of shame, Victor seized the hem of his hoodie and stripped it smoothly over his head, t-shirt and all. Yuuri choked. He was fit. Very clearly trained hard on the ice. The low cabin lights and deep shadows did some incredibly flattering things for the line of muscle down his stomach and Yuuri unsuccessfully tried not to stare.\n\u2018I do know when you\u2019re staring at me, Yuuri.\u2019\nHappily the cabin was dark and Yuuri could hide his blush in the shadows.\nVictor yanked the sweater down over his head and shot Yuuri an amused glance through tousled hair. \u2018Not saying I mind, remember.\u2019 He grinned and Yuuri badly wanted to kiss him. Perhaps something of that showed on his face. Victor\u2019s smile faded just a little, replaced by something quieter and searching. \u2018What do you want from me, Yuuri?\u2019\nYuuri leant his head back and scrubbed his palms over his eyes. \u2018Would you believe me if I told you that I honestly had no intention of speaking to you on these flights?\u2019\n\u2018Not even a little bit?\u2019\nYuuri shook his head and dropped his hands. \u2018I was just going to stop drinking water and cross my legs for fifteen hours and sit still in my seat.\u2019\nAnd Victor laughed. Just a small, involuntary chuckle but it was still there. \u2018And then I opened my mouth, didn\u2019t I?\u2019\n\u2018And then you opened your mouth,\u2019 Yuuri agreed.\n\u2018Sorry.\u2019 Victor didn\u2019t sound the least bit sorry. \u2018But you were very cute.\u2019\nThe tips of Yuuri\u2019s ears turned red but still he said, \u2018Were?\u2019\n\u2018Oh Yuuri,\u2019 was all Victor said quietly. He turned to face Yuuri and gazed at him with a soft, unreadable expression. \u2018Shall I kiss you again?\u2019\nLike an idiot, like he enjoyed torturing himself, he reached and touched Victor\u2019s cheek. Just a soft brush of fingertips down his jaw. \u2018I wish you wanted to.\u2019\nVictor murmured something he didn\u2019t understand. \u2018I do. I did. Please - what I said before - I was angry. I didn\u2019t mean it, Yuuri. I would kiss you now, I would kiss you again, and again, and I would keep kissing you until you couldn\u2019t breathe.\u2019\nHe already couldn\u2019t breathe. \u2018I\u2019m - I\u2019m sorry, I should have just told you I knew.\u2019\n\u2018Yes, you should have.\u2019\n\u2018But I-\u2019 Yuuri paused and closed his eyes, just briefly to collect himself, \u2018I know it\u2019s only been twenty-five hours and no-one can ever really know a person in such a short time, but I like you, Victor. I don\u2019t care that you skate. That wasn\u2019t what made you likable. Remember when you were telling me your version of an embarrassing story? You had your legs tucked up and you\u2019d taken your shoes off, your socks don\u2019t match, did you know that? You were sat there in your mismatched socks and you kept laughing your ridiculous laugh and I don\u2019t think anyone could have looked at you and not seen how great you are.\u2019\nVictor made a quiet noise and Yuuri looked up into wide blue eyes. \u2018What I want from you is - unrealistic,\u2019 Yuuri continued. Honesty came easier in the close space between them, in the stillness pressing through the dark cabin, the sense that they were the only two humans awake and together in this moment. \u2018I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any point talking about it.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\n2 hours and 15 minutes\n\nYuuri sat with his knees up to his chest, cradling a cup of sprite and focusing beyond the queasy, hungover feeling in his stomach. Most people were sleeping, just a few reading lights dotted the cabin. A flight attendant walked past, the quiet swish of her skirt and pad of footsteps muted.\n\u2018Hello.\u2019\nYuuri looked up into the awkward face of Yuri Plisetsky.\n\u2018Did I fuck things up?\u2019 Yuri asked abruptly.\n\u2018Kinda, yeah.\u2019\n\u2018Okay. Sorry.\u2019\nYuuri shrugged and Yuri jammed his hands in his pockets.\n\u2018So you\u2019ve told him, yeah?\u2019 Yuri asked.\nStretching his legs out, Yuuri looked across at Victor\u2019s sleeping face. He was dribbling a little on to his own shoulder and in some weird way it was touchingly adorable. \u2018I told him I knew who he was, haven\u2019t told him that I skate.\u2019\n\u2018Why not you idi-\u2019\n\u2018Because it\u2019s embarrassing,\u2019 Yuuri cut him off shortly.\n\u2018Can I tell him when this flight\u2019s over?\u2019\nAgain Yuuri shrugged. \u2018I\u2019d rather it if you didn\u2019t, but I suppose it doesn\u2019t really matter. He\u2019s quitting skating and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll skate again, so I won\u2019t see him again.\u2019\nYuri snorted and scuffed his foot on the carpet. \u2018Don\u2019t bet on it, Katsuki, he\u2019s into you. If you tell him you want to, he\u2019ll make sure you see each other again. Just saying.\u2019\nYuuri looked at him in silence for a moment. \u2018You came back here to make sure I knew that, didn\u2019t you?\u2019\nThe carpet received a particularly vicious kick. \u2018He\u2019s not bad, you know. He\u2019s okay. Gets attached stupidly easy though.\u2019 Yuri flicked his eyes up to Yuuri, just for a second. They exchanged a nod. Then Yuuri sighed and slumped back in the seat.\n\u2018I thought it was just a game to him. Who feels anything at all after just one day?\u2019\n\u2018Too much information,\u2019 Yuri said firmly. \u2018I don\u2019t actually care that much.\u2019\nExcept he did and Yuuri could see it in his face. In silence he transferred his sprite to one hand and reached out with the other, he looped his arm around Victor\u2019s shoulders and slowly guided him sideways. He was a heavy, warm weight beneath Yuuri\u2019s arm and Yuuri gently settled his head under his chin. Sat like that, Victor slumped asleep under his arm and against his chest, Yuuri felt a protective spark. He lifted his hand where it was curled around Victor\u2019s shoulder and slid it softly over his head, pushing his hair from his forehead.\n\u2018Just, like, give him your number or something, okay?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\n50 minutes\n\nVictor was snoring. Small, droning little snores against Yuuri\u2019s neck. Yuuri had long given up pretending to watch a movie and instead sat there with his eyes closed, drifting to the sound of Victor\u2019s breathing and the solid warmth of his body under his arm.\nThey were were going to start their descent soon. Was it selfish to wish Victor was awake? Somehow they\u2019d come a full circle, from that first flirting, Yuuri telling himself it wasn\u2019t meant to matter and it wasn\u2019t meant to last, to the awful clarity of the last few hours, to Yuuri once again gazing at Victor, telling himself it wasn\u2019t meant to matter and it wasn\u2019t meant to last.\nYuuri dipped his head and pressed a quick kiss to Victor\u2019s forehead. \u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 he said quietly. There was a lot he was sorry for, he wasn\u2019t even sure if he could define it for himself. For how he felt, for the things he had said, the stupid choices he had made, for how Victor felt, for how Victor perhaps felt about him.\nVictor stirred slightly and mumbled something.\n\u2018Victor?\u2019 Yuuri said softly. He was selfish. He did want Victor to wake up and spend these last minutes with him. Victor made a small noise of protest and remained still. \u2018We\u2019ll be landing soon.\u2019\n\u2018No.\u2019 It was mumbled, but still audible. Yuuri felt much the same.\n\u2018Sorry.\u2019\nThis time with a louder groan, Victor slowly stretched and curled back in against Yuuri. There was something intimate in feeling Victor stretch against his body, half-asleep and pressed in close, clothes rumpled and riding against his own. \u2018How long?\u2019 Victor\u2019s voice was deep and rough with sleep, far too close to Yuuri\u2019s ear.\n\u2018Less than an hour now.\u2019\nAnother unhappy, sleepy groan. \u2018No,\u2019 he repeated.\nDespite himself, Yuuri smiled. \u2018You must be fun to wake up in the morning.\u2019\n\u2018Come to St Petersburg and find out,\u2019 Victor mumbled.\n\u2018I\u2019d like that,\u2019 Yuuri said honestly, because why not? What did he have to lose? It wouldn\u2019t happen, the real Yuuri was anxious with an underwhelming skating career, Victor hadn\u2019t thought that Yuuri was cute. Or hot. But in this moment, there was no reason to hide that he quite honestly thought Victor was fantastically attractive.\nThe kiss Victor pressed beneath his ear was hot, suggestive, and not faintly sleepy. \u2018Good,\u2019 Victor murmured.\nHe got his wish. Victor by his side, an arm slung over his shoulder as the plane slowly began its descent. It was a bittersweet feeling. Victor felt something in return, but it still had to end.\n\u00a0\n\nLanded\n\nThe lights were too bright when the plane landed. Yawning, stumbling people poured out into the aisles, tiredness etched into faces and in quiet voices. Outside it was still night. Yuuri stifled a yawn into his hand and hitched his bag up in his arms, shifting his weight as they stood waiting to disembark.\nVictor looped his arm around Yuuri\u2019s chest, tugging him backwards and pressing a kiss to the back of his head. It was so effortlessly affectionate that Yuuri\u2019s heart almost hurt, but he just closed his eyes, smiled and leaned back into Victor\u2019s chest. Things weren\u2019t resolved, not really. He didn\u2019t know what he had said while drunk, and he didn\u2019t know what Victor was truly thinking, but there wasn\u2019t time for that now. For these last minutes he could ignore that all.\n\u00a0\n\nBaggage claim\n\nYuri\u2019s hair was mussed and he looked like a cat brushed backwards. He saw them approaching and Yuuri watched his eyes drop to Victor\u2019s sweater. For the smallest moment, Yuuri thought he saw something pleased cross his face. Then his expression reverted to normal.\n\u2018Have fun in peasant class?\u2019 Yuri sneered as they caught up.\n\u2018I missed you greatly.\u2019 Victor grabbed Yuuri\u2019s face and dropped a loud kiss to the top of his head, ignoring the yelled protests.\nYuuri wandered ahead with Yakov, leaving Yuri and Victor to bicker behind them. They followed the crowds of people filtering down the corridors towards the baggage claim. Yuuri\u2019s feet dragged, he wanted nothing more than to lay down, stretch out properly and sleep.\nYakov clapped his shoulder. \u2018Will we see you at the Grand Prix again this year?\u2019\nYuuri tensed beneath his hand. \u2018I-I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll watch.\u2019\nYakov squeezed his shoulder, giving him a brief shake. \u2018I\u2019m not asking if you\u2019ll watch, boy, I\u2019m asking if you\u2019ll skate again. You messed it last time, shouldn\u2019t let that stop you.\u2019\nThere was a thud as something hit the ground. Heart in his throat, Yuuri couldn\u2019t bring himself to turn around. Not now. Surely not now, not after everything. He could see the baggage carousels from here and the final customs exit, it was so close to being over, this perfect mess of an amazing, disastrous flight. And Yakov had known all along. Despite himself he almost wanted to laugh, an over-tired, hysterical, hopeless laugh.\nFrowning, Yakov stopped and looked over his shoulder.\nVictor was staring in stunned silence, bag on the ground beside him.\n\u2018Told you I wasn\u2019t memorable,\u2019 Yuuri tried to joke. It just felt hollow. It was out. It was done. Strangely, he almost felt relief.\n\u2018Vitya.\u2019 Yakov glowered at him, managing to fit annoyance, exasperation, and resignation into that one well-used glare. \u2018Yo-\u2019\n\u2018Why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u2019\nPeople streamed around them as they stood in the centre of the passage, the three of them stopped silent at the shock in Victor\u2019s voice.\n\u2018I-\u2019\n\u2018You didn\u2019t tell me.\u2019 There was a stunned, wretched catch in his voice and Yuuri\u2019s throat clenched. \u2018You could have told me.\u2019\nQuietly, Yuri stepped behind Victor and picked up his forgotten bag.\n\u2018You\u2019ve -\u2019 Yuuri cleared his throat and tried to force his voice louder, \u2018you\u2019re almost the most decorated male skater. I - I came last. At the Grand Prix, I was so bad. You didn\u2019t even recognise me afterwards.\u2019 Victor hadn\u2019t moved, hadn\u2019t spoken, and Yuuri felt himself keep talking, the words spilling out faster. \u2018I wanted to pretend I was the person you liked on the plane.\u2019\nVictor stared at him.\n\u2018That\u2019s why? That\u2019s why you didn\u2019t tell me?\u2019\nYuuri twitched one shoulder in a shrug as Victor searched his face. This was it. If he had thought it was bad bef -\nAnd then Victor laughed.\nIt was Yuuri\u2019s turn to stare.\n\u2018So what did you do with this real Yuuri? The one that wasn\u2019t who I liked on the plane? Is he locked up somewhere in Japan?\u2019 Amusement crinkled the corners of Victor\u2019s eyes and coloured his voice.\n\u2018Victor,\u2019 Yuuri said heavily.\n\u2018No, Yuuri, please do tell me.\u2019 Victor\u2019s amusement was obvious now and his mouth fighting a smile. \u2018Tell me how that wasn\u2019t you. Tell me why I\u2019d care that you flubbed one competition.\u2019\nYuuri didn\u2019t know where to look. He closed his eyes and took a steadying breath, opening them up to stare at a point on the ceiling beyond Victor\u2019s head. \u2018You didn\u2019t remember me. Yuri said you only remember the important things.\u2019\n\u2018Yuuri,\u2019 Victor\u2019s voice was all warmth. \u2018I can assure you, I didn\u2019t pay attention to this Grand Prix for reasons wholly unconnected to you. I will be more than happy to explain them to you later, should you like.\u2019\n\u2018Right,\u2019 Yuuri said faintly.\n\u2018Yuuri Katsuki, Japan\u2019s top male figure skater,\u2019 Victor was looking at him with open warmth, \u2018what did I do right to get you sitting next to me?\u2019\n\u2018Left your seat booking to the last minute?\u2019 Yuuri didn\u2019t know what to say, it just fell out automatically.\nVictor grinned. \u2018I\u2019ll have you know I was relatively organised, Yakov and Yuri were the ones that didn\u2019t book until later.\u2019\n\u2018You missed out on first class,\u2019 Yuuri pointed out. The fluorescent lights of the airport were bright overhead and the whole scene felt somehow surreal.\n\u2018Mm, true.\u2019 And Victor kissed him.\nHe slid both hands into Yuuri\u2019s hair and gripped firmly, curling his fingers as he pressed a slow, open-mouth kiss to Yuuri\u2019s lips. Yuuri inhaled sharply. Being kissed by Victor was an overwhelming experience, but for the first time in this entire trip he felt - free. It was all said now. There was nothing more he had to hide. Yuuri closed his eyes and finally, finally relaxed into the warmth of Victor\u2019s kiss, his body. Until Victor pulled back.\n\u2018God, Yuuri, I thought there was going to be some horrific reason why you hadn\u2019t told me you skate.\u2019\n\u2018My Grand Prix performance was horrific,\u2019 Yuuri murmured, chasing Victor\u2019s mouth, unwilling to break the kiss. He felt Victor\u2019s breath puff against his lips as he laughed and tugged Victor back down into a kiss, cutting him off before he could speak. Victor obliged with a slow, intense kiss, dragging Yuuri\u2019s bottom lip through his teeth in a way that made Yuuri\u2019s toes curl. But keeping Victor silent apparently took more effort than that. Yuuri could feel him smiling even before he pulled back again.\n\u2018I\u2019ve seen worse. I\u2019ve skated worse.\u2019\nYuuri groaned, partly from embarrassment and mainly because he just wanted to keep kissing Victor. \u2018I was so afraid I\u2019d just blurted it out after all those vodkas.\u2019\n\u2018Oh no,\u2019 Victor grinned against the side of Yuuri\u2019s mouth, \u2018you said a lot of things, but that wasn\u2019t one of them.\u2019\n\u2018What did I say?\u2019\n\u2018Perhaps I will tell you later.\u2019 Victor laughed and tipped his head back to avoid Yuuri\u2019s glare. \u2018I will-\u2019 he turned his head to the side as Yuuri attempted to hold him steady and kept grinning, \u2018- I will say that I was left in no doubts regarding how attractive you found me.\u2019\nYuuri dropped his hands from Victor\u2019s cheeks with another groan. He pressed his palms over his eyes and felt his cheeks burn. Still laughing, Victor slung an arm around his shoulders and tugged him in against his chest.\n\u2018Don\u2019t be embarrassed, Yuuri. I was glad to know. Made me feel like an arse for the things I said.\u2019\nYuuri stayed like that for a moment, tucked in close with Victor. They\u2019d made their way to the edge of the corridor, half hidden behind a pillar and a lone seat. Yakov and Yuri had long since made their exit towards the carousels. After a minute Yuuri dropped his hands from his face. \u2018I didn\u2019t think you would react so calmly.\u2019\n\u2018To realising who you were? Yuuri, this entire flight has been unexpectedly dramatic. I feel like I have exhausted my ability to be surprised. Unless there\u2019s anything else shocking you have to tell m-\u2019\nVictor reacted delightfully to being silenced with a kiss. Yuuri tried to pour a lot of feeling into that kiss. One arm wound around Victor\u2019s waist and the other hand buried in his hair, Yuuri kissed with all the longing he\u2019d kept buried this flight. It came as a vague surprise to acknowledge he\u2019d quite like to press Victor up against that wall behind them. What he\u2019d do next was unknown, but he felt having Victor flush against his body and moaning would be a good start.\nWhen he drew back Victor was fantastically ruffled and maybe just a little breathless.\n\u2018We should - and I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this, but we should really go get our bags.\u2019 Victor hadn\u2019t taken his eyes of Yuuri, and Yuuri get could get used to being looked at in that way.\n\u2018Probably.\u2019 Yuuri reluctantly slid his hand out from its tangled grip in Victor\u2019s hair.\n\u2018I\u2019m still wearing your sweater.\u2019\nYuuri shrugged and tried to play it cool, like he wasn\u2019t extremely aware that Victor Nikiforov was standing there wearing his clothes. \u2018It\u2019s fine.\u2019\n\u2018I mean, I could just take it off n-\u2019\n\u2018No,\u2019 Yuuri said firmly, but unable to keep from grinning at the wicked spark in Victor\u2019s eyes. \u2018Keep it on.\u2019 He chose his next words very deliberately. \u2018You can give it back next time.\u2019\nVictor\u2019s answering smile was gorgeous.\n\u00a0\n\nHasetsu\n\nSaying goodbye to Victor had been difficult.\nYuuri bent and laced up his skates. Even weeks later, back home now, he could still feel the tight squeeze of Victor\u2019s arms around his back. As requested by Yuri and his own feelings, he\u2019d given his number to Victor and taken his in exchange. Thankfully Victor had text him first, before he had time to second-guess himself, convince himself he\u2019d somehow got it wrong, that Victor didn\u2019t really want him to text. But texts were still just\u2026texts. Eventually they were going to stop. Yuuri tugged on his gloves and stood up at the edge of the rink.\nYuuri took a deep breath. \u2018Yuuko, can you record something for me?\u2019\n\u00a0"
