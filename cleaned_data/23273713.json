    "text": "It\u2019s not like he\u2019s doing anyone any good here. May as well be useful once before he dies.\nThe words are still ringing in Jaskier\u2019s head, a full month after they were first spoken - a full month after his father said them, every syllable like a separate barb, like a flight of arrows aimed perfectly for his heart. He\u2019d thought - he\u2019d been pretty sure he was going to end up as the chosen sacrifice, as an unmarried fourth child with no particular prospects and a reasonably pretty face, but he\u2019d thought his father might at least protest - might put up some sort of token objection - not\u2026\nNot suggest it himself.\nHe\u2019d hoped his siblings might object, too, not turn away or shrug or even smile. Hoped his mother might speak. Hoped someone might point out how cruel it is to send anyone into the White Wolf\u2019s jaws as a sacrifice. No one had.\nThere\u2019s suspecting your family has never loved you, and there\u2019s knowing it, and the knowing is like a coal in Jaskier\u2019s heart, burning with a slow and sullen heat, and Jaskier rather expects it won\u2019t stop until his heart is burnt to ash.\nHis guards draw the horse to a halt outside the gates of a great hulking fortress. It\u2019s...really ridiculously imposing, all dark stone and jagged crenellations and heavy iron-barred gates. A suitable den for the warlord everyone calls the White Wolf. Jaskier sits quietly as one of the guards walks up to the gates and knocks, the set of his shoulders suggesting that he would rather be anywhere else. All the guards are twitchy, unhappy, tense - Jaskier can\u2019t really blame them. Walking into the White Wolf\u2019s jaws like this has got to be nerve-wracking.\nBeing sent into the White Wolf\u2019s jaws is something so far past nerve-wracking that Jaskier has come out the other side of panic into an odd glassy sort of calm, where everything seems a little too far away and even his own body doesn\u2019t quite seem to be his. He\u2019s been very docile, this past month of travel, not even putting up a fuss about the ropes around his wrists - silk, but strong enough for all that - or the constant presence of the guards even when he sleeps or uses the latrine. He hasn\u2019t even been able to come up with anything resembling music, which - he can\u2019t remember the last time he went a full month without composing something. He hasn\u2019t been silent so long since he learned to speak, hasn\u2019t kept from singing for more than a day or two since he first realized that his voice could produce music.\nThe only words in his head, this last month, have been his father\u2019s venom, and that\u2019s hardly a song Jaskier cares to sing. And when he does manage to distract himself from that, the only thing his frightened mind can find to fix on is the White Wolf himself - or what little Jaskier knows of him.\nIt\u2019s been more than fifteen years since the White Wolf suddenly appeared, leading an army of inhumanly strong warriors, and overthrew the king of Kaedwen. Jaskier was a child when it happened, and all he knew was that all of a sudden, all of the adults were scared, and people whispered to each other strange things about wolves and monsters. As he grew older and the White Wolf\u2019s conquests became more remarkable, Jaskier started actually hearing the rumors:\nThe White Wolf is more - or less - than a man, somehow crossbred with the giant wolves of the mountains, ferocious and vicious and unpredictable.\nThe White Wolf has a ravenous appetite, for food and sex alike, and not all the beautiful young people who are taken to his bed walk away again.\nThe White Wolf has a temper like a mountain storm, swift and unexpected and so violent that even rocks and trees are broken in its wake.\nThe White Wolf is a warrior without peer, stronger and faster and more deadly even than his inhuman warriors; he can break spears with his bare hands and cleave men in twain with a single swing of his sword.\nThe White Wolf, in short, has swiftly become the boogeyman that every child in the north fears, and every adult in the north, even if, like Jaskier, they are wise enough to discount at least half of the rumors, is also afraid of. And Jaskier doesn\u2019t know which half of the rumors to discount. Regardless of which half he picks, being sent into the White Wolf\u2019s jaws sounds like a good way to die, hopefully quickly but definitely painfully, and Jaskier isn\u2019t looking forward to that at all.\nBut here he is.\nA little door in the great iron-barred gate creaks open, and a man steps out. No, not a man - a Witcher, one of the White Wolf\u2019s troops, the cat-eyed men who make up his unstoppable army, the ones who move faster and strike harder and sense more keenly than any mortal man could do. Jaskier can\u2019t see the slitted eyes from here, but the paired swords on the man\u2019s back - and the silver medallion hanging about his throat - are visible enough, and no one else goes armed like that. He is brown-haired, and his face bears a terrible scar, and he moves like a predator.\nThe guard backs up several feet and bows clumsily. \u201cSir,\u201d he says, \u201cwe have brought - we have brought a gift, from the lords of Redania, with their compliments to the White Wolf.\u201d\nThe Witcher looks the guard up and down, crosses his arms in front of his chest, and turns to regard Jaskier thoughtfully. After a moment he paces closer, and makes a slow circuit around Jaskier\u2019s horse. The guards all stand very, very still, and Jaskier can hear them breathing hard. The horse doesn\u2019t seem to care.\nJaskier, his hands bound in front of him, that strange glassy feeling still encasing him, doesn\u2019t move. The Witcher will accept him or not; if accepted, he will be brought before the White Wolf, and if refused\u2026\nJaskier\u2019s not actually sure what\u2019s going to happen if he\u2019s refused. He can\u2019t exactly go home.\nThe Witcher stops in front of Jaskier, and Jaskier looks down to meet his eyes. They are, indeed, slitted like a cat\u2019s, and an unusual shade of amber. The medallion about his throat bears the head of a snarling wolf. If Jaskier recalls correctly, the Wolf Witchers are the ones nearest the White Wolf\u2019s throne - the ones he trusts most. There are also Bear, and Cat, and Griffin, and Viper, and probably some Jaskier can\u2019t recall just now, behind the glass of his past-panic calm.\n\u201cHuh,\u201d says the Witcher thoughtfully. \u201cAnd who\u2019re you, then?\u201d\nJaskier swallows. \u201cJulian Alfred Pankratz, Viscount de Lettenhove,\u201d he says, because if it\u2019s the last time he\u2019s ever going to be able to claim it, he\u2019ll say his own name. His father\u2019s probably already stricken him from the family books, but Jaskier doesn\u2019t know that yet.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a fair mouthful,\u201d the Witcher says, though he doesn\u2019t sound particularly annoyed. Still, best to be accommodating, right? Best to be as flexible as possible, in case - in case that will help. It probably won\u2019t. Jaskier\u2019s good at being annoying. But he can at least start on the right foot.\n\u201cMost people call me Jaskier,\u201d he offers, and the Witcher\u2019s eyebrows go up a little.\n\u201cHuh,\u201d he says, and shrugs, and takes the horse\u2019s reins from the unresisting hands of the guard. The guards back away hastily. The Witcher turns towards the gate and whistles a complicated little phrase, and one side of the gate creaks open, just far enough to admit the Witcher and the horse.\nAnd Jaskier.\n\u201cDo - does the White Wolf accept the tribute?\u201d the lead guard quavers as the Witcher leads Jaskier\u2019s horse past him.\nThe Witcher pauses, looks the guard up and down again - like he\u2019s assessing how hard it would be to kill him, and deciding it\u2019s not even worth the trouble, Jaskier thinks with a vague impression that he ought to be terrified, and will be, just as soon as this glassy calm runs out - and shrugs. \u201cTell King Vizimir he\u2019d do better to ask what the White Wolf wants,\u201d the Witcher says coolly. \u201cBut I suppose we\u2019ll take the lad.\u201d\nJaskier doesn\u2019t laugh, but behind the glass he\u2019s almost amused. He\u2019s not even wanted as tribute. Gods, has he ever felt more useless?\n\u201cThank you, sir, thank you,\u201d the guard babbles, and the Witcher snorts and leads Jaskier\u2019s horse through the gate.\nIt closes behind them with an almost gentle thump, and Jaskier is inside the walls of the White Wolf\u2019s fortress, and he has never felt quite so alone.\n*\n\u201cAlright then,\u201d says the Witcher, \u201clet\u2019s get you down.\u201d He reaches up and picks Jaskier up, hands almost spanning Jaskier\u2019s waist, and lifts him easily down from the saddle. Jaskier stumbles a little before he finds his footing, and stares at the Witcher in surprise.\nA voice behind him, drawling and amused, says, \u201cWhat\u2019s this, then, Eskel?\u201d\n\u201cTribute from Redania, apparently,\u201d says the Witcher. Eskel. Jaskier\u2019s heard that name before. The White Wolf\u2019s right hand, his most trusted captain.\nAnother Witcher comes sauntering around into Jaskier\u2019s line of sight - a Wolf Witcher, by the medallion. His hair is darker than Eskel\u2019s, and his eyes a deeper shade of amber, and there\u2019s a sort of smirk to his expression that Jaskier doesn\u2019t quite like. \u201cWhat, they\u2019re sending people now?\u201d\n\u201cLooks like,\u201d Eskel says, and draws a knife. Jaskier doesn\u2019t flinch. What\u2019s the point? He\u2019s inside Kaer Morhen, inside the White Wolf\u2019s keep, and if this Witcher wants him bleeding - wants him dead - then Jaskier will be dead, and that\u2019s all there is to it.\nHe is surprised when what Eskel does is to cut the silk rope holding Jaskier\u2019s wrists. It falls to the cobbled courtyard, and Jaskier rubs his wrists thoughtlessly, soothing the slight red marks. Eskel puts the knife away. \u201cC\u2019mon, Jaskier. Let\u2019s go let the Wolf have a look at you, hm? Lambert, pretend you\u2019re useful and find a spot in the stables for the horse.\u201d\n\u201cFuck you,\u201d says the other Witcher - Lambert - but without much heat to it.\nJaskier falls in behind Eskel without objection as Lambert leads the horse away. It was a perfectly nice horse, but Jaskier\u2019s never had much rapport with animals. All of his baggage is on it...but it doesn\u2019t seem worth pointing this out, not when he might not be alive to care about baggage by the time the sun sets.\nKaer Morhen, inside its imposing walls, is...just as imposing, actually. It\u2019s still all dark stone, unadorned and uncompromising; the only decoration Jaskier sees is on the great hall doors, where a pair of carved wolves snarl at each other across the wooden surface. Inside the hall, there\u2019s a set of long tables, none of them occupied - well, it\u2019s midafternoon, neither dinner nor suppertime - and a dais with a bulky stone chair atop it, just as dark and plain as the walls, save for a plate-sized silver wolf\u2019s-head medallion set into the back, just above where a seated man\u2019s head might rest. There\u2019s no one in it just now.\nEskel leads the way through the hall to a rather less imposing door behind the throne, and opens it without knocking. The room revealed is set up as an office, rather to Jaskier\u2019s surprise; he\u2019s never thought of the White Wolf, Warlord of the North, as having so plebian a thing as an office. But here it is, lined with bookshelves, with a large table bearing an unrolled map of the continent set in the center of the floor and another table off to the side heaped with rolled-up maps and little lead troop-markers and quills and inkpots and all the other detritus of a working office.\nThere are two men and a woman in the room, and Jaskier looks at them in reverse order of scariness, because he\u2019s rather worried that when he actually meets the White Wolf\u2019s eyes, this glassy calm is going to crack and he is going to go to his knees in fear.\nLeast terrifying - at least at first glance - is the woman: raven-haired and violet-eyed and gloriously beautiful, with something in her stance that makes Jaskier suspect she\u2019s a sorceress. She\u2019s leaning over the table and gesturing at somewhere in Temeria, talking quietly to the less terrifying man.\nNot to say the less-terrifying man isn\u2019t terrifying: he looks to be in his late middle-age, hair grey with years but shoulders still broad and arms still corded with muscle, and his eyes are cat-slitted, and he wears a wolf medallion and twin swords. He could break Jaskier with one hand, probably. But he\u2019s not -\nWell, he\u2019s not the truly scary man, the one leaning back against the smaller table with his arms crossed over his chest, watching his companions silently. The man with stark white hair and golden slitted eyes, armed and armored as a Witcher, who can only be the White Wolf himself. He\u2019s very, very handsome, and very, very scary, and Jaskier clasps his hands together tightly to try to stop them from shaking. It doesn\u2019t work.\nThe White Wolf looks up as Eskel leads Jaskier in, and raises an eyebrow at Eskel. The sorceress and the old Witcher go silent, both looking up to regard Jaskier curiously.\n\u201cRedania decided to send you tribute, o great White Wolf,\u201d Eskel says, sounding amused instead of respectful.\nThe White Wolf straightens and stalks towards Jaskier, silent as the grave, expression utterly unreadable. Jaskier swallows hard and holds his ground with the very last shreds of glassy calm - breaking and running won\u2019t help, after all. There\u2019s nowhere for him to go. Very slowly, the White Wolf circles him. All the hair on the back of Jaskier\u2019s neck stands up as the White Wolf paces behind him: predator, scream his instincts, and it\u2019s all Jaskier can do not to scream back, I know!\n\u201cTribute,\u201d rumbles the White Wolf as he finishes his circuit. Jaskier can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s pleased or angry.\n\u201cOne Julian Alfred Pankratz, Viscount de Lettenhove, called Jaskier,\u201d Eskel says, nodding.\nOne snow-white eyebrow twitches upward, just a hair. \u201cJaskier,\u201d the White Wolf says flatly.\nJaskier can feel himself flushing a little. It\u2019s not exactly the name of a great hero, or anything - it\u2019s a silly name, a harmless name, and he picked it for himself and he likes it, and if there was ever a person ill-suited to be tossed to the White Wolf and live to tell about it, it\u2019s a would-be bard who named himself Buttercup.\n\u201cIt suits him,\u201d says the violet-eyed sorceress mildly. \u201cGeralt, if you don\u2019t stop glowering, he\u2019s going to faint.\u201d\nGeralt? Jaskier wonders, as the White Wolf finally turns that golden gaze away from him to pin the sorceress, who doesn\u2019t flinch. It\u2019s like the sun has looked away from him, the weight and heat of those golden eyes almost palpable. Gods, no wonder people talk about the White Wolf\u2019s gaze as though it\u2019s a weapon in and of itself. Bad enough when he\u2019s just looking at Jaskier - if he\u2019d been angry, Jaskier probably would have fainted.\n\u201cI don\u2019t glower,\u201d the White Wolf says, which is so far outside what Jaskier was expecting that his jaw actually drops.\n\u201cGeralt, darling, you hardly do anything but glower,\u201d the sorceress says, grinning. \u201cYour face is just like that, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d\nWhatever Jaskier expected of the White Wolf\u2019s inner circle, it wasn\u2019t people who teased the most dangerous warlord on the continent. The sorceress - he thinks he heard something about this, about the prize pupil of Aretuza who threw her lot in with the White Wolf and brought half a dozen of her compatriots with her. Yennefer, that was the name. Apparently she\u2019s done well for herself at the White Wolf\u2019s side.\n\u201cSometimes he snarls,\u201d Eskel says, lounging back against a bookshelf with a bright smile. \u201cThough I grant you that\u2019s not much better.\u201d\n\u201cSometimes he\u2019s asleep,\u201d says the old Witcher, and the White Wolf sighs and lets his head sag forward and rubs his forehead with his fingers in - in fond exasperation. Jaskier is very, very confused.\n\u201cWhat the fuck am I supposed to do with a viscount?\u201d the White Wolf says, giving Jaskier a golden-eyed glance. Jaskier swallows hard. He knows what the lords of Redania expect the White Wolf to do with him. He was sent to appease the Wolf\u2019s hunger - any of his hungers. Frankly, the nobility of Redania would probably be very relieved if they got word that the White Wolf had bent Jaskier over one of those long dining tables and fucked him bloody between plotting battle campaigns, because it would mean that Jaskier was performing the function he was sent to fill.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Eskel says. \u201cWhat are you good for?\u201d\nJaskier flinches. He doesn\u2019t mean to, but that glassy calm is wearing off under the new onslaught of fear and confusion, and he is about three inches from just collapsing in a weeping mess. Everyone notices the flinch, though, and three sets of cat-slitted eyes and one set of violet ones go wide.\n\u201cLet me rephrase that,\u201d says the sorceress after a moment. \u201cWhat are you good at, little flower?\u201d\n\u201cI studied for four years at Oxenfurt, and graduated with honors,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cI can play a lute, a viol, a harp, or a flute, and I can sing...anything you care to name. I compose, music and lyrics both.\u201d He pauses, takes a long slow breath, and adds bitterly, \u201cAnd I\u2019m told I\u2019m quite a good lay.\u201d\n\u201cHuh,\u201d says the White Wolf. Eskel and the old Witcher, whose name Jaskier hasn\u2019t caught, both look nonplussed. The sorceress, though, looks delighted.\n\u201cA bard!\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019ve been needing a court bard, Geralt.\u201d\n\u201cI have?\u201d the White Wolf asks. Jaskier is still adjusting to the idea that the White Wolf has a name, and that it\u2019s something as prosaic and commonplace as Geralt.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to be conquering significant swathes of the continent, you need at least one bard to make songs about it,\u201d Yennefer says briskly. \u201cAnd here\u2019s one delivered right to your door! Very convenient.\u201d\n\u201cHuh,\u201d says the White Wolf again, and looks Jaskier up and down thoughtfully, eyes lingering on the lute calluses on Jaskier\u2019s fingers. \u201cAlright. What do you need, then, bard?\u201d\nJaskier thinks he might collapse from sheer bafflement. And relief. Maybe mostly relief. \u201cA lute?\u201d he says. \u201cAnd - ink and quills and parchment - somewhere to work - I need to know what sort of songs you want me to write -\u201d\n\u201cEskel, get him set up, would you?\u201d the White Wolf asks, and turns back to the enormous map. Eskel shrugs and grins and ushers Jaskier out again, one hand on Jaskier\u2019s shoulder to keep him upright. Jaskier is frankly grateful for it. His knees feel distinctly wobbly. His everything feels distinctly wobbly.\nHe\u2019s looked the White Wolf in the eyes, and has not been devoured.\n*\n\u201cLet\u2019s find you rooms,\u201d Eskel says, and leads Jaskier up into the keep\u2019s corridors. They pass other Witchers and ordinary men and women, warriors and servants and people whose purpose Jaskier can\u2019t place, all of whom nod respectfully to Eskel and most of whom give Jaskier curious looks. Jaskier would normally try to be charming - to smile and wink and maybe even flirt a little - but he\u2019s not exactly at the top of his game just now.\nEskel leads him up several flights of stairs, into one of the keep\u2019s many towers, and down a short corridor to a perfectly ordinary door. There is, to Jaskier\u2019s blank surprise, a suite on the other side of the door: sitting room and bedroom, both well-appointed and utterly barren of personality. There\u2019s a bookshelf and a desk in the sitting room, and a comfortable-looking chair.\n\u201cNormally a guest room,\u201d Eskel says. \u201cYours now. Privy\u2019s at the end of the hall; baths are down in the basement, we\u2019ve got hot springs.\u201d\nJaskier nods dazedly. He was expecting -\nWell, he was expecting dungeons, or being chained at the foot of the White Wolf\u2019s bed, or being tossed out of the gates again as not what the White Wolf wanted.\n\u201cYou bring any baggage with you?\u201d Eskel asks. Jaskier nods again.\n\u201cIt was on the horse,\u201d he says, and Eskel nods.\n\u201cI\u2019ll have someone bring it up,\u201d he says. \u201cMight take me a bit to find you a lute, but ink and parchment\u2019s easy; someone\u2019ll bring you those by this evening.\u201d He pauses, head cocked like he\u2019s just heard something, and then his lips quirk into a smile even as his voice slides down into a low and menacing growl. \u201cI hear a heartbeat.\u201d\nJaskier\u2019s breath catches. What - what on earth -\nSlowly, Eskel stalks towards the unlit fireplace, and then, suddenly, lunges, reaching up the chimney and yanking. To Jaskier\u2019s abiding shock, someone falls out of the chimney, landing on all fours in the fireplace. They are small, and very sooty, and Eskel swoops them up and whirls them around, burying his face against their throat and growling with a menace utterly belied by the care in his grasp. The small person giggles in clear delight, crying, \u201cUncle Eskel,\u201d in a high child\u2019s voice.\nWhen Eskel puts the small person down, they turn to face Jaskier, and Jaskier can finally get a good look: a girl, maybe nine or ten years of age, with white-blond hair and brilliant green eyes. She grins at him fearlessly. \u201cUncle Eskel, who\u2019s this?\u201d\n\u201cThis is Jaskier, from Redania,\u201d Eskel says, ruffling her soot-streaked hair. \u201cHe\u2019s our new bard.\u201d He tilts his head, regarding Jasier thoughtfully for a moment. \u201cYou said you went to Oxenfurt.\u201d\nJaskier nods. \u201cI studied the seven liberal arts and graduated summa cum laude.\u201d\n\u201cHuh,\u201d Eskel says. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll have to ask your father, but it looks like you might have a new tutor, cub.\u201d To Jaskier he adds, \u201cThis is Ciri. She\u2019s the White Wolf\u2019s daughter.\u201d\nJaskier\u2019s eyes go wide. He had no idea the White Wolf had a child - certainly there\u2019s never been any rumor about it, nor about the White Wolf taking a consort, for that matter - but the hair is certainly similar, and she holds herself a little like the White Wolf does, calm and confident even so young, poised like - well, like a young wolf, swift and agile and fearless.\n\u201cIt would be my honor to be the young princess\u2019s tutor,\u201d he says. Princess is a guess - he\u2019s not sure what one calls the daughter of a warlord.\nCiri giggles. \u201cI\u2019m not a princess - I\u2019m a menace.\u201d\n\u201cSo you are,\u201d Eskel says, sounding fond and long-suffering. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s dunk you in a hot spring before supper. Did you have to find the sootiest chimney you could?\u201d\n\u201cI wanted to be ready to hug Uncle Lambert,\u201d Ciri says as Eskel ushers her out. Eskel snorts and shakes his head.\n\u201cCome on down to the main hall for supper in about three hours,\u201d he calls over his shoulder to Jaskier, and shuts the door behind him. Faintly, Jaskier can hear him say, \u201cLet\u2019s see if we can find Lambert on the way down to the hot springs, cub.\u201d\nJaskier is alone, in a suite of rooms that is frankly nicer than his own rooms in Lettenhove, in the White Wolf\u2019s keep.\nHe retreats very slowly into the bedroom, shuts the door, and collapses onto the bed. It\u2019s very comfortable; the mattress is well-stuffed and the blankets are soft wool, a neutral brown that isn\u2019t exciting but is restful for the eyes.\nThis is...not how he expected the day to go. It\u2019s a hell of a lot better, he\u2019s not complaining, but he feels a fair bit like he\u2019s been knocked over the head with something heavy, because nothing about today has been what he expected, except maybe the raw terror. And even that\u2026\nThe White Wolf is terrifying, with the golden eyes and the paired swords and the aura of just-barely-leashed danger. But he didn\u2019t even lay a hand on Jaskier, didn\u2019t seem to intend to do so. Jaskier\u2019s gotten pretty good at telling when people are interested in him, and as far as he could tell, the White Wolf didn\u2019t even register him as a possible sexual partner, any more than he would have done a - a mule, or a table. Which is slightly unflattering, but a lot more reassuring. And no one else has been even impolite, except maybe Lambert - who is apparently about to be hugged by a very sooty child, which suggests he\u2019s more bark than bite.\nSo this is...not as terrible as Jaskier expected.\nFor some stupid reason, it\u2019s the lack of horrid danger that finally cracks that glassy calm and lets all the built-up panic and grief and anger come roaring back out, and Jaskier rolls over and buries his face in the plain brown blankets and weeps, tears burning his cheeks and terrible wracking sobs leaving his throat feeling scraped raw by the time he finally gets himself back under control.\nHe lies there feeling drained, like all his emotions have been washed away by the tears and all that\u2019s left is a sort of waiting blankness. After a little while, quite accidentally, he falls asleep.\nJaskier is woken by a tap on his bedroom door, and for a moment he doesn\u2019t know where he is: this is not his bedroom in Lettenhove, nor yet his room at Oxenfurt, and it certainly isn\u2019t any of the slightly dubious inns or campsites he\u2019s been sleeping in for the last month. Then his memories come rushing back, and he sits up fast, because he\u2019s in the White Wolf\u2019s keep and he was supposed to go down for supper and if he fails to do so he might anger Eskel, who has been actively helpful and maybe even a little friendly, and if he enrages his one possible ally in this place he\u2019s probably fucked.\n\u201cComing!\u201d he calls to whoever is on the other side of the door, and tugs his doublet into place - it\u2019s all rucked up from being slept in, which was not the smartest thing he could have done. He can\u2019t do a damn thing about his scratchy eyes or the crease in his cheek from a fold in the blanket. Fuck.\nHe opens the door to find a boy of about thirteen waiting in the sitting room. \u201cJaskier?\u201d the boy asks. \u201cEskel sent me to make sure you\u2019d make it down for supper.\u201d\nJaskier\u2019s shoulders sag with relief. \u201cThank you,\u201d he says. \u201cIs there somewhere I can wash my face first? Or - oh, there my bags are.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll get you a basin of water,\u201d the boy says, and scampers off. Jaskier fishes a new doublet out of his bag and changes, and when the lad comes back, splashes some water on his face and finger-combs his hair to tidiness.\n\u201cHow do I look?\u201d he asks the lad, who gives him a thoughtful appraisal and shrugs.\n\u201cFancy,\u201d he says. \u201cBut nice.\u201d\nWell, Jaskier hasn\u2019t seen anyone here wearing anything that isn\u2019t either plain leather armor or plain servants\u2019 garb, so...yes, alright, his simple turquoise doublet might well count as fancy here. Too late to change that now, even if he ought to. \u201cThank you,\u201d he says, with a little bow of gratitude, and the boy grins.\n\u201cDo you need me to lead you down to the hall?\u201d he asks.\nJaskier considers, and nods. He\u2019s going to need a few days to learn the corridors of the keep. Apparently he\u2019s going to have those days, if he\u2019s to be court bard and the young princess\u2019s tutor, instead of the White Wolf\u2019s...sacrifice.\nThe boy leads him down cheerfully enough, and ushers him in through a small door that opens about halfway up the hall\u2019s length. The long tables are filling up, Witchers and normal humans alike crowding each one, and Jaskier notices that each table\u2019s Witchers wear different medallions. The ones closest to him have snarling bears on their chests; the next table over has rampant griffins. The head table, just below the dais and set at right angles to all the others, is filling with people wearing wolf medallions.\n\u201cThere you are,\u201d someone says, and Jaskier turns to see Eskel striding towards him. \u201cC\u2019mon.\u201d He herds Jaskier ahead of him to the very end of the Wolf table, the least important seat - but still a seat at the high table, which Jaskier was not expecting. There aren\u2019t many other non-Witchers at the Wolf table: Ciri, scrubbed clean, is at the left hand of the imposing chair at the center of the table, and Yennefer at her left hand, and another woman who is probably also a sorceress about halfway further down the table\u2019s length. Other than that, it\u2019s all Witchers...and Jaskier.\nEskel settles into the chair to the right of the White Wolf\u2019s, and Jaskier turns his attention to his own neighbor: a sober-looking dark-haired Witcher who is eyeing Jaskier dubiously. Jaskier offers a hand. \u201cI\u2019m Jaskier.\u201d\n\u201cOh!\u201d the Witcher says, and shakes his hand. \u201cAubry. I thought Lambert was making shit up again, claiming we\u2019d gotten a bard.\u201d\nGotten a bard? Not been sent tribute? Jaskier blinks for a moment. \u201cWell, here I am,\u201d he says at last, for lack of any better idea.\n\u201cHere you are,\u201d Aubry agrees, and that seems to be all the conversation he cares to make. Jaskier sits in awkward silence watching the room fill for a moment, before the benches and chairs are scraping back and he hurries to rise to his feet along with everyone else as the White Wolf comes in, the old Witcher whose name Jaskier didn\u2019t catch a pace behind him.\nThe White Wolf takes his place at the table and looks around, golden eyes seeming to note every person in the room. Jaskier draws in a sharp breath as that piercing gaze sweeps over him. But the White Wolf just nods, and sits, and everyone else sits, and a line of servants starts bringing out platters of food.\nAubry isn\u2019t exactly a scintillating conversation partner, but he does make sure to pass the platters all the way down to Jaskier, which makes him a hell of a lot politer than any of Jaskier\u2019s siblings, so Jaskier decides he likes him. The food is not fancy - venison, dark bread and good salted butter, wilted spinach with bacon, a spread that wouldn\u2019t be out of place on a fairly wealthy peasant\u2019s board save for the fact that there\u2019s so much of it - but it\u2019s well-made and hot, and Jaskier hasn\u2019t been eating very well recently. He eats his fill and thinks it\u2019s the finest meal he\u2019s had in...in a very long time.\nMeals at home were always flavored with disappointment and derision; meals at Oxenfurt tended to be whatever he could scrounge between study sessions and practice sessions and (being perfectly honest) ill-advised flirtations. This may well be the finest meal Jaskier has had since he was a child too young to know he wasn\u2019t what his father wanted him to be.\nHe\u2019s feeling quite contented with the world when his plate is finally empty, and sits back with a mug of really nice ale to watch the room. Witchers are not quiet diners: the rumble of conversation is loud enough that Jaskier would probably have to yell to make himself heard if he wanted to talk to Aubry. It\u2019s happy conversation, though, laughter ringing above the commotion regularly, and Jaskier can see Witchers bumping shoulders or clapping each other on the back, clearly teasing and joking together, at every table and even between the tables. The normal humans scattered among the Witchers don\u2019t seem apprehensive about their companions, either; Jaskier can see a woman at the Bear table scolding a Witcher who looks quite amusingly sheepish, a man at the Griffin table telling a story that involves a great deal of expansive gesturing for which the Witchers on either side of him simply lean out of the way. Ciri, over beside the White Wolf, is bouncing in her seat as she talks to her father, and Jaskier is mildly astonished to see the White Wolf bending his head to listen to her with a tiny smile on his lips, nodding along with whatever she is saying amiably. Yennefer is chuckling into her goblet - she gets wine, Jaskier notices, though no one else seems to. The other sorceress, past Yennefer, is talking to the Witcher beside her animatedly, and he is nodding and frowning as though deeply interested in her words.\nNone of the humans in the hall - those at the tables or the servants carrying platters of food and pitchers of ale - seem at all frightened of their cat-eyed companions. And none of the Witchers, so far as Jaskier can see, are doing anything that would induce fear. Most of them are just...eating and talking and joking with each other, as any group of comrades might; a few, their meal finished, are having a wrestling match between the tables. All the reaction that gets from anyone around them is for people to scoot their benches a little further in, and one young woman kicks at the wrestlers until they roll off to the end of the hall and then goes back to her dinner as though she hadn\u2019t just been kicking a pair of men who could have easily slain her without even breaking stride.\nWhich suggests that though they could, they won\u2019t. That sort of unthinking trust is something that\u2019s earned, and the fact that every human in the hall seems utterly unbothered by the Witchers around them means...means that as long as you\u2019re on their side, Witchers probably aren\u2019t actively dangerous. Presumably there are lines that oughtn\u2019t be crossed, and Jaskier will have to learn them; and he knows they\u2019re terrible to have as enemies, each Witcher far more dangerous than an entire company of human troops; but maybe this will be...survivable. Possibly even fun, once Jaskier gets his feet under him. Certainly most of the Witchers don\u2019t seem as prone to glowering as the White Wolf who leads them.\nHe glances over at the White Wolf, who is -\nWho is looking right at him.\nJaskier swallows hard. The White Wolf inclines his head, just a little - a beckoning gesture. Jaskier puts his mug down, takes a deep breath, and stands, walking as calmly as he can along behind the row of Wolf Witchers until he\u2019s standing beside the White Wolf\u2019s chair.\nThe White Wolf pushes back his chair and rises, and claps a hand on Jaskier\u2019s shoulder, tugging him to stand beside him, both of them looking out over the hall. Eskel gives a short, sharp whistle, and silence falls through the entire hall far more quickly than Jaskier would have expected. Every eye turns to the White Wolf - and, perforce, to Jaskier.\nThis is not like standing up on a stage to perform. Jaskier has never actually experienced stage fright - he likes performing far too much to fear it - but if this is what it feels like, he suddenly has much more sympathy for his fellow students who did suffer from it.\n\u201cThis is Jaskier, from Redania,\u201d the White Wolf says. \u201cOur new bard.\u201d There\u2019s a low murmur of mild surprise at that, which is cut off when the White Wolf adds, in a low growl that raises every hair on the back of Jaskier\u2019s neck, \u201cAnd he is mine.\u201d\n\u201cWhite Wolf,\u201d comes the chorus from every throat in the hall, agreement and obedience and something Jaskier can only call fealty resonating through the simple words. The White Wolf nods and sits down, letting go of Jaskier\u2019s shoulder, and everyone\u2019s attention goes back to their own dinners and conversations. Jaskier steps back, letting the tall back of Eskel\u2019s chair give him a little cover.\nWhat...what the fuck did the White Wolf mean by that? Jaskier still doesn\u2019t get the impression that the White Wolf intends to take him to his bed - the clasp of the White Wolf\u2019s hand on his shoulder was utterly impersonal, firm enough to hold Jaskier in place and gentle enough not to bruise, and did not linger at all - but to claim Jaskier as his so very...bluntly is hard to give any other interpretation.\nThe White Wolf leans back in his chair and looks at Jaskier, golden eyes unreadable. \u201cNo lute,\u201d he observes quietly.\n\u201cAh, no, um...my lord?\u201d Jaskier says nervously. He has no idea what title he should be using - just calling the man White Wolf as his warriors do seems insufficient - and he doesn\u2019t want to look like he\u2019s trying to make excuses or get Eskel in trouble by trying to explain.\n\u201cNone in storage,\u201d Eskel says, to Jaskier\u2019s surprise. \u201cSent a lad down the Trail for one, but it\u2019ll be a day or three.\u201d\n\u201cHm,\u201d says the White Wolf. \u201cCan you sing without one?\u201d\n\u201cYes, my lord,\u201d Jaskier says.\n\u201cHm,\u201d says the White Wolf again, and pushes his chair back a little more. Ciri clambers out of her chair and into his lap, looking up at Jaskier imperiously.\n\u201cSing something with an adventure in it, please!\u201d she says.\n\u201cSomething with an adventure,\u201d Jaskier says, starting to grin. The White Wolf might terrify him, but it\u2019s hard to be quite as scared of a man holding his daughter in his lap and giving her a fond look of indulgence. Something with an adventure, but suitable for a child\u2026 \u201cHow about the Ballad of Maid Marian?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that one,\u201d Ciri says, and settles herself more comfortably across her father\u2019s lap. \u201cGo on.\u201d Yennefer stands and drapes herself over the back of the White Wolf\u2019s chair, watching Jaskier expectantly.\nJaskier hums a warm-up note, glances briefly at the White Wolf, who is watching him with an unreadable expression but doesn\u2019t seem to disapprove, and starts to sing, quietly enough that he won\u2019t disturb anyone who doesn\u2019t care to listen. Given a lute and a few hours to practice, he would be perfectly happy to perform for everyone in the hall, but right now he is only trying to please one person: the little princess Ciri, who looks steadily more delighted with every verse he sings.\nThe Ballad of Maid Marian tells of a young noblewoman who dresses as a boy and runs away to become the finest archer in the land, winning a contest against her lover and making him admit she has defeated him. The version Jaskier is singing is not even slightly bawdy - though there are versions which are - and Maid Marian is bold and clever and heroic, and saves her lover\u2019s life at one point. Jaskier is better with an instrument to keep the tune going, but he can sing without one well enough, even after a month without practice - well enough to delight the young princess, at any rate.\nShe claps happily when he finishes and gives her a flourishing bow, and then she elbows her father and says, \u201cThat was really good, wasn\u2019t it? You have to tell him you liked it, otherwise it\u2019s rude.\u201d\nThe White Wolf gives her a very fond look and nods to Jaskier. \u201cIt was fine,\u201d he says. Jaskier would be mildly offended at the lack of enthusiasm except that he has been getting the distinct impression that the White Wolf isn\u2019t enthusiastic about anything, and \u2018fine\u2019 is probably about as lavish as praise from him ever gets.\n\u201cThank you, my lord,\u201d he says, bowing again. \u201cAnd thank you, my lady.\u201d\nCiri giggles. \u201cI\u2019m not a lady,\u201d she says.\n\u201cLittle menace,\u201d Yennefer says, \u201cyou are a noble lady, insofar as anyone in this mad pack is noble. Your father\u2019s a king of sorts, after all.\u201d\nThe White Wolf, interestingly, grimaces. \u201cUgh,\u201d he says, and Yennefer laughs.\n\u201cMight be good to have someone around who knows about court etiquette,\u201d she says. \u201cNot terribly relevant here, of course, but you do talk to various kings and such, and it\u2019s good to know how rude you\u2019re being, right?\u201d\nEskel chuckles. \u201cI had better learn court etiquette,\u201d he says, turning his chair a little so he can see Jaskier. \u201cSince past experience suggests I\u2019ll be the one doing most of the talking. Some people can get away with just glowering at everyone until they cooperate, but alas, I am not among them.\u201d He grins at the White Wolf, who sighs at him rather more dramatically than Jaskier expected.\nHe\u2019s playing along, Jaskier realizes suddenly. The White Wolf is being teased, and he\u2019s playing at being irritated, because it amuses his...friends? Allies? Family? Pack?\n\u201cDo I have to learn court etiquette?\u201d Ciri asks, peering up into her father\u2019s face.\nThe White Wolf frowns a little in thought. Jaskier swallows and dares to put his two coppers in. \u201cA lot of court etiquette is learning how to insult people very politely.\u201d\nCiri\u2019s emerald eyes go wide. \u201cReally?\u201d\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d Yennefer concurs. \u201cHm, let me see, it\u2019s been years since I tried to insult someone politely.\u201d She looks Jaskier up and down. \u201cI might, perhaps, observe that our bard\u2019s trousers and doublet are such a charmingly unique color combination.\u201d\nJaskier would bristle, but firstly, she\u2019s obviously testing him, and secondly, she still sounds teasing. The test isn\u2019t just whether he can take a barb, it\u2019s whether he\u2019s worth being part of this camaraderie. \u201cIt\u2019s the newest fashion at Oxenfurt, my dear,\u201d he says as unctuously as he can, and then puts a hand over his mouth in exaggerated dismay. \u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry, I had forgot you\u2019ve been in the country these last few years.\u201d\nYennefer bursts into delighted laughter. \u201cLittle flower has teeth!\u201d she chortles. \u201cSee, cub, that\u2019s how you insult people politely.\u201d\nCiri is looking at both of them wide-eyed. Eskel is snorting laughter behind a muffling hand. And the White Wolf...well, he\u2019s not smiling, exactly, but there are crinkles at the corners of his eyes that suggest he would be smiling if he weren\u2019t so devoted to keeping a glower constantly on his handsome face. \u201cI want to learn to do that,\u201d Ciri breathes, and Jaskier gives her a full court bow, all flourishes and grace.\n\u201cThen I will be honored to teach my lady,\u201d he says, and she giggles at him and hops off her father\u2019s lap and tries to imitate his bow.\nJaskier spends the rest of the evening teaching a very small princess how to do a proper court bow, with a sorceress laughing at both of them and Eskel giving utterly unhelpful suggestions and the White Wolf watching them, golden-eyed and unreadable. Unreadable, that is, until Ciri gets her bow utterly perfect and turns to see if her father approves, and he gives her a tiny smile and a slow nod that makes her light up and bounce on her toes in glee.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a good teacher,\u201d she informs Jaskier. \u201cYou can be my tutor. I won\u2019t scare you off like I did the last one.\u201d\n\u201c...Oh?\u201d Jaskier asks. \u201cAnd what did you do to the last one, my lady?\u201d\nHe is utterly flabbergasted when it\u2019s the White Wolf who says, voice warm with amusement, \u201cProbably better you don\u2019t know.\u201d\nJaskier gives the White Wolf his very best innocent expression. \u201cBut then how will I know what to be wary of, my lord?\u201d\n\u201cJust look out for toads,\u201d the White Wolf says, still warmly amused, and stands, gathering Ciri up. She wriggles like a snake, and ends up dangling from the White Wolf\u2019s outstretched arm, her arms and legs wrapped around it and her head hanging down. The White Wolf sighs at her, fond and exasperated, and heads for a door at the head of the hall - not the office door, but one half-hidden in the shadows. Jaskier tries to imagine how much strength it takes to hold a squirming nine-year-old child up on one arm without even showing the effort, and is reminded yet again that he is currently in the White Wolf\u2019s keep, and for some unfathomable reason, the White Wolf continues to be\u2026\nKind.\nThis is not what Jaskier expected.\n\u201cI\u2019ll walk you up to your rooms,\u201d Yennefer says. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be tutoring Ciri, we\u2019ll have to work out a schedule.\u201d\n\u201cAre you also teaching her?\u201d Jaskier asks, falling in beside her obediently.\n\u201cShe\u2019s going to be the most powerful sorceress in millennia,\u201d Yennefer says, grinning fiercely. \u201cShe\u2019s going to be magnificent.\u201d\nJaskier nods. He\u2019s not quite sure what to say to that. \u201cWhat schedule do you currently keep for her lessons?\u201d he asks, instead of trying to figure out how to react to learning that his new pupil is a budding sorceress.\nBy the time they reach Jaskier\u2019s new rooms, they\u2019ve hashed out at least a tentative schedule for Ciri\u2019s lessons - which include not just sorcery but swordplay, as she is apparently getting much the same training young Witchers do - and Yennefer appears to have decided that Jaskier is somewhere between an amusing new toy and a pleasing new ally.\nShe claps him on the shoulder and leaves him at the door to his rooms with a wicked grin and a single tidbit of advice: \u201cWitchers respect courage. Stand your ground, little flower, and you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\nJaskier wakes the next morning feeling...a lot better than he has in the last month, actually. The bed is very comfortable - well-stuffed and warmly blanketed - and the thick stone walls of the keep mean that no noise has disturbed his sleep. He could definitely use a bath, though.\nHe gathers a change of clothes and a swatch of toweling he finds in the chest at the foot of his bed, and ventures out into the corridors, spotting a lad in the same plain clothing as yesterday\u2019s helper after only a few moments. The lad directs him to a staircase which leads all the way down to the hot springs, and adds the useful information that the Witchers will all be on the practice fields or out hunting until at least midmorning, so if Jaskier is quick, he\u2019ll have the hot springs mostly to himself.\nThe hot springs are astonishing, actually. Jaskier doesn\u2019t know what he was expecting, but a vast cavern, wreathed in steam, containing a long series of linked pools of clear, slightly pungent water, is a lot more impressive than he expected. There are a few people splashing about - men and women both, without any attempt to separate the sexes - and one of the women waves to him. Jaskier goes over and gives her his very best friendly smile.\n\u201cYou\u2019re the bard, hey?\u201d says the woman, and gestures to the water. Jaskier thinks she might be the woman who was seated at the Wolf table last night; she has curly chestnut hair and bright blue eyes, and a cheerful grin. \u201cC\u2019mon in, we\u2019re not fussy about formality here. I\u2019m Triss. You\u2019re Jaskier, right?\u201d\n\u201cI am, and honored to meet you,\u201d Jaskier says, bowing like he\u2019s at court and then stripping off his sleeping clothes and sliding into the water. It\u2019s just short of too hot, and feels absolutely amazing.\n\u201cHottest water up at that end, coldest down the other way,\u201d Triss says. \u201cMost unmodified humans don\u2019t go any higher than this pool, but the Witchers like the really hot end.\u201d\nJaskier nods his thanks. \u201cI think I shall stay here or a little lower,\u201d he allows. \u201cThis is lovely, but any hotter and I shall begin to wonder if I have been turned into a lobster.\u201d There might be a comic song in there somewhere - The Song of the Lobster, or something like that? Oh me, oh my, the lobster cried, the water\u2019s getting hotter -\nOh, it feels good to have lyrics starting to bubble up again. There\u2019s a scrap of tune, too; he\u2019ll have to write it down as soon as possible. He should see about getting a little folding slate to carry about with him the way he used to do at Oxenfurt, to scribble things down.\nTriss giggles. \u201cWell, you shan\u2019t find any arguments from the sensible inhabitants of the keep, I assure you. What brings you to Kaer Morhen all the way from Redania?\u201d\nJaskier hesitates. Apparently, for some reason he genuinely can\u2019t imagine, the handful of people who know that he was sent here as tribute have not been spreading that knowledge around. \u201cKing Vizimir sent me,\u201d he says at last, \u201cas a token of his respect for the White Wolf.\u201d\n\u201cAs an attempt to placate him, you mean,\u201d Triss says, grinning rather wolfishly herself. \u201cSmart of him to figure we needed a bard.\u201d\nJaskier smiles and nods, because that is not why he was chosen, but if people want to put that interpretation on it, he\u2019s not going to complain. \u201cAnd what an opportunity!\u201d he says instead. \u201cNo one else is writing songs of the White Wolf\u2019s exploits yet - not from this side, anyhow. I\u2019m frankly astonished there aren\u2019t half a hundred bards already here.\u201d\n\u201cI think Geralt scared a couple off, years ago, and the word spread,\u201d Triss says, leaning back against the smooth edge of the pool and closing her eyes in contentment. \u201cGood on you for not running like a startled fawn last night.\u201d\n\u201cMy knees were too wobbly,\u201d Jaskier confesses, and Triss laughs.\n\u201cEh, they\u2019re not so bad, Witchers,\u201d she says. \u201cI won\u2019t say they don\u2019t bite, but usually only people who are really asking for it.\u201d\n\u201cUnfortunately, I have a knack for annoying people,\u201d Jaskier says, finding a bar of fairly nice soap tucked onto a little ledge to one side and starting to wash.\n\u201cEh, you\u2019re Geralt\u2019s,\u201d Triss says, as casually as if the statement is nothing to worry about. \u201cNobody else will mess with you, and he\u2019s harder to rile than you\u2019d think. Just don\u2019t be stupid enough to try to hurt Ciri.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d rather cut my own hand off,\u201d Jaskier says, quite honestly. Hurt a child? Never.\n\u201cThen you\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Triss says, and lapses into silence. Jaskier finishes washing, thinking hard.\nYou\u2019re Geralt\u2019s. Nobody else will mess with you. That puts a bit of a different complexion on being claimed so publicly. If the White Wolf was trying to protect him\u2026\nThat\u2019s very, very interesting, especially as Jaskier hadn\u2019t done anything to warrant that sort of protection. Still hasn\u2019t, though perhaps being Ciri\u2019s tutor will go some way towards earning himself a place that isn\u2019t purely based on the White Wolf\u2019s suffrance.\n\u201cHave you any tales that would make good songs?\u201d he asks Triss when she sits up and levers herself out of the water, reaching for a towel. He also admires the view, because she is a very lovely woman, but politely. He doesn\u2019t want to piss off someone who is willing to be friendly with him.\n\u201cOh, plenty,\u201d Triss says. \u201cTell you what, come find me this afternoon sometime - I\u2019ll be in the stillroom - and I\u2019ll tell you about the siege of Ard Carraigh.\u201d\n\u201cThank you!\u201d Jaskier says, beaming. That sounds like exactly the sort of story the court bard of the White Wolf ought to immortalize in song. Triss gives him a friendly nod and wraps her towel around herself and wanders off towards an antechamber that looks to be rather less full of steam, and Jaskier finishes washing and does the same, finding that the antechamber is both large and - somehow - steam-free, which does make getting dressed easier. There\u2019s even a large sheet of polished bronze hung on one wall to use as a mirror, something Jaskier did not expect in a keep full of warriors. On the other hand, there are at least two sorceresses here, so it might not be for the warriors at all.\nThere\u2019s breakfast laid out in the great hall - bread and porridge and leftover venison and hot tea and a surprising amount of fruit - and Jaskier piles a plate and retreats to the end of the Wolf table, which is mostly empty. A couple of the other humans in the hall - there are no Witchers present - give him polite nods, and he nods back and smiles as winningly as he knows how.\nAfter breakfast he stops one of the servants and asks where the princess\u2019s rooms are, and after a brief moment of confusion the man laughs and says, \u201cOh, the cub! Suppose she is a princess, at that, or something like it,\u201d and points Jaskier to the appropriate stairway.\nCiri\u2019s rooms are at the very top of the tower: the most defensible point, if Kaer Morhen were ever to be attacked. The stairway is narrow and winding, and Jaskier is willing to bet that two Witchers could hold the tower against a hundred assailants.\nCiri opens the door when he knocks, and bounces with glee at the sight of him. \u201cAre we going to learn to be rude today?\u201d\n\u201cUnfortunately, first we need to learn to be polite,\u201d Jaskier says, and Ciri wrinkles her nose at him.\n\u201cOh fine,\u201d she says, and pulls him in, pushing him into a chair beside the desk and perching on the other chair beside him. \u201cPapa says you have to help me with my maths, too, and history, and geography. Blech!\u201d\n\u201cWell, history\u2019s just a bunch of stories,\u201d Jaskier says, smiling down at her. \u201cAnd geography\u2019s about where those stories were. Maths...well, if you want to lead armies, you\u2019ll need to be able to do maths.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be one of Papa\u2019s captains when I\u2019m grown,\u201d Ciri says, frowning adorably. \u201cAlright, you can teach me maths, I guess.\u201d\nJaskier chuckles and leans back in his chair. \u201cTell you what, how\u2019s about you tell me what you know already, and we can go from there?\u201d\nCiri lights up and starts talking fast enough it\u2019s hard to keep up with, and Jaskier jots down notes and nods and makes encouraging noises. She\u2019s a very bright child, is the White Wolf\u2019s daughter, and her previous tutor - or possibly Yennefer - gave her a good grounding in reading and writing and maths, but she\u2019s got little history and less geography, and her grasp of court etiquette is roughly nonexistent.\nWell, Jaskier\u2019s never been afraid of a challenge, and as long as he can keep his lessons entertaining, he hopefully won\u2019t have to worry about toads.\n*\nCiri tows him down to the great hall for dinner, and to Jaskier\u2019s dismay insists that he sit next to her, only two seats down from the White Wolf\u2019s chair. He attempts to make a court etiquette lesson out of the argument - bards don\u2019t usually sit at the high table at all, and certainly not at the princess\u2019s left hand! - but Ciri just frowns at him, looking rather startlingly like her father, and says, \u201cI want you here. This isn\u2019t some silly southern court.\u201d\nJaskier is trying to find the right words to argue with that when Yennefer leans over the back of Ciri\u2019s chair and says, mock-mournfully, \u201cReplacing me already, little menace?\u201d\n\u201cNever, Aunt Yen!\u201d Ciri says, which startles Jaskier a bit. He\u2019d been assuming - rather foolishly, it appears - that Yennefer was Ciri\u2019s mother.\n\u201cLet the poor bard eat in peace,\u201d Yennefer says, nudging Jaskier to retreat. \u201cYou can tell me everything you\u2019ve been doing this morning, hm?\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d says Ciri, rather huffily, and Jaskier mouths Thank you to Yennefer and slips quietly down to the end of the table. Just in time, too: the large doors at the end of the hall bang open and a flood of Witchers pours in, most of them clearly just out of the baths, wet-haired and in many cases shirtless, all of them laughing and shoving at each other and making a quite impressive ruckus. To Jaskier\u2019s mild amazement, the White Wolf is among his warriors, just as disheveled and damp, with one of Eskel\u2019s arms thrown around his shoulders. Eskel is laughing. The White Wolf is almost utterly expressionless - except for the very slight crinkle at the corners of his eyes that Jaskier only sees as the pack of wolf Witchers reaches the head table.\nLearning to read the White Wolf is going to take some time, Jaskier suspects, and a lot of attention to very small shifts of expression. It seems like the only time the White Wolf truly shows his emotions easily enough for anyone to read is when he is with his daughter.\n...Said daughter is telling her father something while gesturing excitedly with her table knife, and the White Wolf bends his head to listen to her with an indulgent half-smile.\nDinner is apparently not as formal a meal as supper is; everyone sits without looking at the White Wolf for permission. The food is still plain but good, and Aubry is still taciturn, and Jaskier spends the meal watching Witchers and human warriors eat really remarkable amounts of food. Jaskier is going to have to watch their training at some point, if it generates such astonishing appetites.\nDinner is also a much shorter meal; the Witchers finish their food and get up again almost immediately, going off in clumps together to do...whatever warriors do in the afternoon. Yennefer takes Ciri off with her, presumably for sorcery lessons, and the White Wolf and Eskel and the old Witcher whose name Jaskier still hasn\u2019t caught go into the office behind the throne together. Jaskier spots Triss getting up and hastens to finish his ale and follow her.\n\u201cCome along,\u201d she says, giving him a cheerful glance as he catches her just before a doorway, and leads the way not up but down, through a long corridor and a narrow staircase to a room built into the mountainside, with narrow slit windows that let in cool air and bright sunlight. It\u2019s a very large stillroom, with several long tables and a broad fireplace, and Jaskier picks a corner where he\u2019s not likely to knock over any of the remarkable array of distilling equipment. Triss sets about doing incomprehensible things with a number of herbs and other..objects, most of which Jaskier can\u2019t name.\n\u201cHow\u2019d your morning with the little menace go?\u201d she asks, glancing over at Jaskier, who has been distracted by the possibility of a verse involving potions bubbling like the hot springs below.\n\u201cVery well, I think,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cShe\u2019s a bright little thing.\u201d\n\u201cSo she is,\u201d Triss says, grinning. \u201cSharp as a sword. Think you can keep up with her?\u201d\n\u201cI can certainly try,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cShe\u2019s not much like her father.\u201d He\u2019s fishing, a bit too obviously, and Triss\u2019s grin gets sharper.\n\u201cShe\u2019s just as fierce,\u201d she says, a warning Jaskier intends to take to heart.\n\u201cGood to know,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd speaking of fierce - you said you\u2019d tell me about the siege of Ard Carraigh?\u201d\n\u201cSo I did,\u201d Triss says, and pauses to measure a foul-smelling black liquid carefully. It sizzles as it hits the clay beaker. \u201cIt was the first siege the White Wolf\u2019s army ever attempted, though obviously not the last.\u201d\nJaskier nods. \u201cI...have heard conflicting accounts of what precipitated the White Wolf\u2019s decision to conquer the northlands.\u201d\nTriss snorts. \u201cConflicting, hm? That\u2019s a very diplomatic way of saying that nobody wants to admit they know why Geralt decided to turn warlord. What do you know about Witchers, bard?\u201d\n\u201cThey are stronger and faster and have keener senses than normal humans, age more slowly and heal more swiftly, and have some ability to do magic,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cOr at least, that\u2019s what most of the tales agree on. The older stories, from before the White Wolf began his campaigns, claim that Witchers were created to guard men from monsters.\u201d\n\u201cOh, well remembered!\u201d Triss says. \u201cThat\u2019s it precisely. Now, for a long time, Witchers stayed well out of politics.\u201d Jaskier\u2019s eyebrows go up: conquering Kaedwen and Caingorn and two-thirds of Redania and the top half of Aedirn, with obvious plans to keep going once the current conquests have been digested, doesn\u2019t seem like staying out of politics to him. \u201cAs I understand it,\u201d Triss continues, \u201cGeralt was out hunting monsters, and ran across some of the victims of the last king of Kaedwen. Have you heard of him?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard...rumors,\u201d Jaskier admits. They weren\u2019t nice rumors, either. The sort of things you can\u2019t talk about with children around. The sort of things that...well, that get kings overthrown, if they\u2019re stupid enough to do them to nobles rather than peasants. Or even just to too many peasants.\n\u201cApparently - and I wasn\u2019t here for this, mind you, this is just what I\u2019ve heard from those who were here - Geralt came back to Kaer Morhen that winter and asked a question. \u2018We kill monsters. What about the ones that are shaped like men?\u2019\u201d\nJaskier\u2019s eyes go wide. If there were ever words meant for a song - oh, he can work with this. He can make a whole damn song cycle with this. The White Wolf spake to the whole wolf pack, shrewd were his words and wise - \u2018For we are meant to monsters slay, in fair or foul guise\u2019 - oh yes, there\u2019s enough here to give him inspiration for years.\nTriss shrugs. \u201cI\u2019m told they spent the whole winter debating it, and then sent out word to all the other Witcher schools to come and discuss it, and then I\u2019m told there were some...well, duels is a little too polite. Really vicious single combats, and a couple of brawls. And at the end of it, there was a Witcher army, and their first target was the king of Kaedwen.\u201d\n\u201cWho holed up in Ard Carraigh and closed the gates,\u201d Jaskier supplies.\n\u201cYep,\u201d Triss says. \u201cGuess he thought Witchers couldn\u2019t actually besiege a city.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve never heard how Ard Carraigh actually fell,\u201d Jaskier says. He knows it did - he was not very old at the time, but he remembers the way the news went through the noble houses of Redania like wildfire, how all the adults started clustering together and muttering worriedly.\nTriss turns and lounges back against the table and grins. \u201cSo I wasn\u2019t there for it, obviously, but I got this straight from Eskel. They concentrated their main forces at the gates, and pretended they were settling in for a proper siege - got mocked, too, since they didn\u2019t have any siege equipment or anything. And then after three nights, Geralt and Eskel and Lambert and a couple of Witchers from the other schools went over the walls very quietly, made it all the way into the palace, captured the king, dragged him back out of the city, and beheaded him in front of the main gates that morning.\u201d\nJaskier gapes. That\u2019s the most efficient - and, oddly, most bloodless - method of ending a siege he\u2019s ever heard of. \u201cSo they opened the gates,\u201d he says.\n\u201cYep. Vesemir and some of the other more patient Witchers spent a while going through records and finding the people who\u2019d helped the king do horrid things, and executed them too, and then they found someone who could promise to be a better ruler without lying or pissing himself, and went off...and found out that the new ruler considered himself Geralt\u2019s vassal. Apparently Geralt panicked and went off into the wilderness for a week when he got the first wagon of tribute.\u201d\nJaskier blinks at her. \u201cQuick question: Vesemir?\u201d\n\u201cThe old Witcher who sits near Geralt at dinner,\u201d Triss says. \u201cHe was the teacher for the Wolf School; now he\u2019s one of the White Wolf\u2019s main advisors.\u201d\n\u201cGotcha,\u201d Jaskier says, and hums thoughtfully. \u201cI think whatever song I end up writing will not include the White Wolf panicking at being given tribute.\u201d He\u2019s certainly gotten more used to it by now - but then, the fall of Ard Carraigh was fifteen years ago. Hm. Through the halls of Ard Carraigh the White Wolf sought his prey / the king whose monstrous appetites had earned a Witcher\u2019s ire / and there before the gates he brought the monster to his fate \u2026needs some work, but there\u2019s a tune there, Jaskier can work with this. Something about the White Wolf\u2019s unwillingness to shed innocent blood, perhaps?\nTriss chuckles. \u201cProbably wise,\u201d she agrees. \u201cHe does have a sense of humor, but\u2026\u201d\nJaskier nods. He\u2019s written rude songs about various nobles of Redania, but none of them had the actual power of life and death over him, and until he has a better outline of what the White Wolf will and won\u2019t tolerate from a bard, he\u2019s going to be very careful about stepping over that line. \u201cWhat did they send?\u201d\n\u201cOh, food, wine, gold, silk, the usual sort of placate-the-warlord stuff. We get a wagonload about once a month from one city or another, these days.\u201d Triss shrugs. \u201cSometimes they send horses. Everyone\u2019s just sort of guessing at what Geralt might want.\u201d\nAnd some of them guess better than others, Jaskier thinks, with a certain bitterness. The nobles of Redania, for instance, guessed wrong. Though it\u2019s worked out...really astonishingly well thus far. It\u2019s only been a day - fuck, it\u2019s only been a day since Jaskier followed Eskel into the White Wolf\u2019s den - but instead of being savaged, Jaskier has been given work suited to his talents, and the protection of the White Wolf himself, and the tentative friendship - no, perhaps better to say merely alliance thus far - of the young princess and two sorceresses and Eskel.\nActually, when he lays it all out like that, he\u2019s doing quite astonishingly well for himself.\nThere\u2019s something gloriously ironic - and more than a little painful - about the idea that a castle full of Witchers can see more value in Jaskier than his own family can.\n\u201cRight,\u201d Jaskier says, because following that train of thought any further is just going to end in tears. \u201cI am definitely going to write a song about the siege of Ard Carraigh - come to think of it, that would be the perfect start to a song cycle about the rise of the White Wolf - but for now, can I help you with anything, since you\u2019ve given me so much help?\u201d\n\u201cCome chop this,\u201d Triss says, giving him an approving little nod, and Jaskier spends the rest of the afternoon chopping herbs and...other things he doesn\u2019t really want to name...into small pieces, and watching Triss do incomprehensible things with distilling equipment, and humming to himself as he tries out melodies. A song cycle needs a through-line - ooh, a tune specifically for the White Wolf, to be worked in whenever he shows up - something catchy but a little ominous, perhaps? Something that makes the listener feel a little awe, a little fear. Like being caught by golden eyes.\nWell. If Jaskier ever manages to convey how it feels to be looked at by those golden eyes and then not eaten, in music, that song will make him famous forever.\n*\nSupper is just as cheerful and rowdy that night as it was the first night. Jaskier isn\u2019t expecting to be summoned to the White Wolf\u2019s side again - surely that was a one-time thing - but he has reckoned without Ciri. The princess clambers into her father\u2019s lap again once they\u2019ve both finished eating, and says something in his ear, and the White Wolf looks down the long table at Jaskier and gives that same little beckoning motion with his head, and Jaskier, of course, obeys.\n\u201cWill you sing another song?\u201d Ciri asks when he stops beside the White Wolf\u2019s chair. \u201cI really liked the one you sang yesterday.\u201d\n\u201cIt would be my pleasure,\u201d Jaskier assures her. \u201cWhat sort of song would you like tonight? Or you, my lord?\u201d\nThe White Wolf gives him a completely unreadable look and hums noncommittally. Jaskier has no idea what that means. A preference? A lack of preference? A complete disinterest in music?\n\u201cGive us a love song,\u201d Yennefer says, shifting over to sit in Ciri\u2019s chair and leaning one elbow on the table, chin in her hand. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard a good love song since we left Aretuza.\u201d\n\u201cHappy ending? Sad ending?\u201d Jaskier checks.\n\u201cHappy,\u201d Ciri says firmly. \u201cI don\u2019t like the sad endings.\u201d\n\u201cOne love song with a happy ending for my ladies,\u201d Jaskier says, and picks The Passionate Shepherd because despite the title it\u2019s not even a little bit bawdy, and is therefore fit for little princess ears.\nIt\u2019s also got a good catchy chorus, and Jaskier is absolutely flabbergasted - though not, thankfully, enough to throw him off his tune - when Eskel and Yennefer join in on the second iteration. They both have decent, if untrained, voices. Ciri joins in on the third chorus, and that\u2019s enough, apparently, to make Triss wander down from her seat and lean on the back of Yennefer\u2019s chair to listen, and when Jaskier looks around as subtly as he can, he sees old Vesemir tapping the beat on the side of his ale mug, a handful of other wolf Witchers clearly listening and enjoying themselves, even prickly Lambert grinning at the occasional very subtle double entendres in the lyrics. The only person who doesn\u2019t seem to be enjoying himself is the White Wolf\u2026\nOr at least, that\u2019s what Jaskier thinks until he finishes the song and Ciri starts to applaud, with Yennefer and Triss joining her a moment later and Eskel and Vesemir deigning to add a few claps, and the White Wolf gives Jaskier a nod and a low, gruff hum that - if Jaskier hasn\u2019t completely lost the ability to read people - is almost certainly approval.\n\u201cAnother!\u201d Ciri chirps. \u201cPlease?\u201d\n\u201cWhat would you like?\u201d Jaskier asks. He\u2019s happy to keep singing as long as he\u2019s allowed - it may be a small audience, but they\u2019re appreciative, which is all a bard really wants, after all.\n\u201cYou pick,\u201d Ciri says, lounging back against her father\u2019s chest with an imperious little wave, and the White Wolf actually chuckles, ducking his head to press a soft kiss to her pale hair.\nJaskier considers his audience and chooses a comic song, one about two sets of lovers who get lost in a forest and follow the wrong people and fall in love and out of love and back in love again while the Fey Folk watch and laugh.\nHis little audience applauds again when he finishes - actually, almost a quarter of the Wolf table applauds, Jaskier is genuinely startled - but the White Wolf frowns a little. \u201cThey aren\u2019t like that,\u201d he says.\n\u201c...Who aren\u2019t?\u201d Jaskier asks warily.\n\u201cFey Folk,\u201d the White Wolf says. \u201cThey don\u2019t play nice jokes.\u201d\nThat might be the most words the White Wolf has said to Jaskier at any one time. \u201cAh,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cArtistic license?\u201d\n\u201cHm,\u201d says the White Wolf.\n\u201cThey could be elves,\u201d Ciri says. \u201cElves are nice.\u201d\nElves, Jaskier knows, are protected in the lands held by the White Wolf. So are dwarves and other nonhuman folk. A large number of elven refugees have taken advantage of that promise of protection, and there are - so Jaskier has heard - several thriving communities in the foothills of the Blue Mountains, close enough to Kaer Morhen that even particularly stupid bigots will not dare venture to attempt to break the White Wolf\u2019s law.\n\u201cI could replace Fey with elves easily enough, I suppose,\u201d he says. Most lines would still scan, and he can fudge the ones that don\u2019t.\n\u201cHm,\u201d says the White Wolf, but he nods, and Jaskier makes a mental note to re-write the song as soon as he has ten minutes and a scrap of parchment.\n\u201cAnother song, my lord?\u201d he asks.\nThe White Wolf shakes his head and stands, Ciri cradled in his arms. \u201cCubs need their sleep,\u201d he says, half to Jaskier and half to a pouting Ciri, and leaves the hall, brushing past Jaskier close enough that Jaskier can feel the more-than-human warmth of him.\n\u201cI want another song,\u201d Eskel says. \u201cGive us something bawdy, bard, now that the cub\u2019s off to bed.\u201d\n\u201cOoh, The Saucy Tavern-Maid,\u201d Yennefer says, grinning. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard that one in years.\u201d\nJaskier laughs and launches into the song, and by the end of it, almost half the Wolf table is bellowing the chorus along with him, the crack of their hands clapping the beat better than a bass drum. It\u2019s so good, getting to perform and being appreciated, being welcomed - it\u2019s far headier than the ale, more intoxicating than even the finest spirits Jaskier has ever had.\n\u201cYou\u2019re good, bard,\u201d Eskel says when the applause is over. \u201cI\u2019ll have that lute for you soon.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Jaskier says, beaming with the overflowing joy of a successful performance. \u201cI\u2019m even better with a lute.\u201d\n\u201cI believe you,\u201d Eskel says, laughing. Jaskier laughs, too. Nothing is funny, but - he\u2019s alive, he\u2019s performing, he\u2019s wanted here, even if he was dumped on their doorstep unexpectedly, and it\u2019s the best feeling, like warm sunshine in his veins.\nLike a piercing, golden gaze.\nJaskier\u2019s days fall into a pattern, and to his surprise, it\u2019s a pleasant one. He spends his mornings working with Ciri, who is bright and enthusiastic and energetic, and he has to work hard to keep her interested, but when he does, she excels. His afternoons are given over either to composing or to helping Triss in the stillroom while she tells him stories of the White Wolf\u2019s exploits or to pestering anyone who looks friendly for stories - and a surprising number of people, Witchers and humans alike, seem to take pleasure in indulging him. Almost every evening, he\u2019s summoned to the White Wolf\u2019s side to sing for Ciri, and after the White Wolf takes her off to put her to bed, he sings for the rest of the hall, taking requests from Witchers and sorceresses and human warriors and servants alike. Once he gets a lute, he\u2019s much less shy about making a little noise, and the Witchers seem to like it, if the way they clap along and bellow choruses and demand more songs is any measure of their approval.\nHe starts to learn the rhythms of life in Kaer Morhen. Groups of Witchers go out every few weeks to roam the lands the White Wolf claims, and return again months later with news of small skirmishes or justice imposed or a new group of refugees settled. Wagons of tribute arrive every month or so and are distributed with astonishing fairness among Witchers and humans alike - even Jaskier comes in for some of the bounty, a handful of bolts of silk cloth and a very nice viol that no one else cares to claim, ink and parchment and a fur cloak that helps a great deal with the bitter cold of a Kaer Morhen winter. Reports come in regularly of trouble - monsters or raids or just humans being stupid - and the White Wolf sends out bands to deal with it or - much more rarely - goes himself. Having sorceresses around is very useful: the Witchers can go to the site of the trouble, or fairly near it, by portal, and often return the same way. And in between, the Witchers practice their weapons and the servants keep food on the table and everything ticks over like a well-made clock. Jaskier finds himself fit into it like another cog - an odd size, perhaps, but one that fits with Ciri and Triss and maybe Yennefer and Eskel and even - possibly - the White Wolf himself.\nBecause Jaskier spends more time around the White Wolf than he would have expected. He still eats at the end of the high table, but he\u2019s summoned up to the White Wolf\u2019s side nearly every night, and as long as his songs aren\u2019t too inaccurate, the White Wolf seems to put up with them - maybe even to enjoy them. He only gripes when a description of a monster or a battle isn\u2019t correct. Jaskier makes time to corner Eskel or Lambert or any of the other Witchers who will talk to him - there are quite a few, actually, of multiple schools - and ask for details about monsters, and raids the fairly extensive library for more information, so that the corrections grow rarer and the White Wolf\u2019s frown less frequent.\nAnd then there\u2019s the other thing. Jaskier had thought it was a joke, the suggestion that he might end up teaching court etiquette to the White Wolf and his closest advisors, but he\u2019s been in Kaer Morhen about a week when a lad knocks on the door to his rooms in the middle of the afternoon and informs him he\u2019s wanted in the White Wolf\u2019s office. Swallowing apprehension, Jaskier presents himself at the doorway, and Eskel ushers him in with a friendly smile.\n\u201cEtiquette,\u201d the White Wolf rumbles from his place leaning against the smaller table. He\u2019s glowering, as usual, but Jaskier doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s because of him. \u201cKing Vizimir wants to meet. What do we need to know?\u201d\nJaskier thinks that maybe he should feel bad about giving the White Wolf and his inner council a swift course in Redanian etiquette and all the gossip and advice he can remember about the Redanian court - maybe he should feel like he\u2019s betraying his people - but they betrayed him first, and he\u2019s far, far more welcome and valued here in Kaer Morhen than he ever was in Redania. He tells the White Wolf everything he can think of, from King Vizimir\u2019s favorite wines to the feuds among the nobles to the politest way to tell someone to fuck off. The White Wolf listens quietly, golden eyes fixed on Jaskier; Eskel and old Vesemir take notes.\nJaskier doesn\u2019t realize that it was a test until about a week later, when he\u2019s summoned again. \u201cWent to Redania,\u201d the White Wolf says. He looks...less tense, Jaskier realizes. He hadn\u2019t even realized the White Wolf was tense, but there\u2019s a looseness to his shoulders that wasn\u2019t there the last time. \u201cYour advice worked.\u201d\n\u201cIt did?\u201d Jaskier asks, startled, and then grins. \u201cOf course it did! Did you scare the shit out of everyone, White Wolf? Please tell me you did.\u201d\n\u201cOf course he did,\u201d Eskel sighs. \u201cAnd I got to be the diplomatic one. Again. One of these days I\u2019m going to make you do the talking, Wolf.\u201d\n\u201cHm,\u201d says the White Wolf, with a little quirk to his lips. \u201cUnlikely.\u201d\n\u201cBastard,\u201d Eskel grumbles, clearly not meaning it very much.\n\u201cTemeria,\u201d the White Wolf says to Jaskier. \u201cWhat do you know?\u201d\n\u201cUm,\u201d Jaskier says, and wracks his brain, and starts talking.\nAfter that he\u2019s summoned every week - regularly enough that he starts expecting it - to talk about court etiquette or noble gossip or just the history of wherever the White Wolf is interested in this time. Sometimes it\u2019s in preparation for a diplomatic excursion - as diplomatic as the White Wolf ever gets, at any rate - sometimes it just seems to be curiosity. Whatever it is, the White Wolf asks his questions and then listens closely to every word Jaskier speaks, golden eyes fixed on the bard. And if the information ends up being useful, the White Wolf tells him so, gives him a nod of approval and a gruff, \u201cCame in handy,\u201d or, \u201cWorked like you said,\u201d that makes Jaskier feel like he\u2019s just won a bardic competition. There\u2019s something deeply intoxicating about having the White Wolf\u2019s attention and approval - about having those golden eyes look right through him and then, each time, away again without burning him to the bone.\nThinking he was about to be killed wasn\u2019t appealing at all, but the hint of threat, when Jaskier is growing ever surer that he isn\u2019t actually in any danger at all, is astonishingly compelling. Jaskier finds himself wanting those golden eyes on him as often as possible - wanting to see if he can coax a smile, even a little one, from those glowering features, or play a song entertaining enough to make the White Wolf clap or laugh or even, if Jaskier is ever unfairly lucky, perhaps sing along.\nJaskier doesn\u2019t want to tame the White Wolf. That would be a very, very stupid dream, and almost certainly end in his untimely and unpleasant death. He just wants to\u2026\nWell, he wants to be one of the people who is allowed to tease, to touch, to laugh with the White Wolf and be teased and touched in turn. Yennefer can: she drapes herself over the White Wolf\u2019s shoulder, touches his wrist to get his attention, toys with his hair. Eskel can: he slings his arm over the White Wolf\u2019s shoulders, kicks his ankle when he\u2019s exasperated, arm-wrestles with him for the entertainment of the Wolf table. Ciri, of course, can climb all over her father and hang off his arms and braid flowers into his hair if she cares to.\nJaskier wants...too much, probably, he\u2019s always wanted too much, aimed too high, dreamed too big. He wants to be part of the inner circle, not for the power - what does he want with power? - but because the White Wolf is like a magnet, drawing people in, and Jaskier...Jaskier knows how an iron filing feels, now.\nBut he\u2019s not an idiot, so he tutors Ciri and sings at supper and gives advice about various courts, and helps Triss and makes friends in the baths and flirts cheerfully with anyone who cares to flirt back, and makes himself a place - not such a bad place, either - in the White Wolf\u2019s halls, and tells himself very firmly to be content.\nReally, apart from his growing attraction to the White Wolf - which Jaskier is ignoring as hard as he can - the only problem with living in Kaer Morhen is the celibacy. People will flirt with him, yes, but the Witchers consider him off-limits because the White Wolf claimed him, and the sorceresses are frankly a little intimidating, and it\u2019s just rude to hit on servants, which leaves Jaskier alone with his trusty right hand and a really distressing number of fantasies starring the Warlord of the North and his piercing golden eyes.\nSetting that aside, though, Kaer Morhen becomes - well, becomes a home far more quickly than Jaskier would have guessed it could. It\u2019s no Oxenfurt, full of people who speak the same languages of music and academia - though the sorceresses are all quite well-educated, and Kaer Morhen does have a surprisingly good library, albeit mostly on the topics of monsters and how to kill them - but after the first few months, most of the people of Kaer Morhen seem to like Jaskier, to be happy to see him, to enjoy his singing. He feels welcome here, in this great dark castle full of inhuman warriors, far more welcome than he ever did in Lettenhove.\n*\nIt\u2019s been almost a year since Jaskier was brought to Kaer Morhen when the diplomatic envoys from Redania arrive. Jaskier knew they were coming - everyone did, they\u2019re escorting a caravan of tribute from King Vizimir that ought to actually have things the White Wolf wants in it, and while they\u2019re in Kaer Morhen they\u2019re going to be trying to hammer out a treaty that will leave King Vizimir in charge of the third of Redania that he still holds. (Jaskier is only a little nastily smug about the fact that sacrificing him to the White Wolf gained Redania exactly nothing except the White Wolf thinking the nobles of Redania were utterly useless instead of mostly useless - eh, what is Jaskier thinking, he\u2019s a lot nastily smug about that.)\nJaskier has decided that the welcoming supper for the Redanian envoys is the perfect time to debut the newest song in his song cycle. The Witchers have been quite appreciative of his efforts thus far: The Siege of Ard Carraigh got riotous applause, The Wolf in Caingorn got the entire Griffin table up on their feet stomping along, and The Fall of Hagge has been requested eight times since Jaskier first sang it barely a month ago. Even the White Wolf seems to approve of the songs, and once - only once, but such a glorious moment that it\u2019s burned into Jaskier\u2019s memory - Jaskier heard him humming a snatch of the White Wolf theme that runs through all the songs. Clearly, the song cycle - Jaskier\u2019s going to call it The Wolf Rising, maybe, he hasn\u2019t decided yet - is pleasing to his lord, so it\u2019s only right for Jaskier to sing the newest song in it for such honored guests! The fact that the song is Ghelibol Burning, about the destruction of a city which tried to oust all its elven inhabitants and was subsequently burnt to the ground by angry Witchers, and which just happens to be in Redania, is purely a coincidence.\nSo yes, Jaskier knows the Redanian envoys are coming, and he\u2019s chosen his outfit and his song and taught Ciri how to be as polite as she cares to be and briefed the White Wolf and his inner council on Redanian mores so that they can be as polite as they care to be, and he\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019s ready for this.\nThat surety drains away as the Redanian envoys walk warily into the hall, and Jaskier sees who leads them.\nHis father.\nOh fuck no.\nAubry reaches over to grab Jaskier\u2019s forearm. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d he asks, quietly, under the sound of Eskel making polite diplomatic noises at the envoys.\nJaskier quite likes Aubry, even if the other man is quieter than the fucking White Wolf himself, because Aubry has never been less than kind to him. But this - Aubry, like most of the inhabitants of Kaer Morhen, doesn\u2019t know that Jaskier was sent as tribute. That he was thrown away, a sacrifice that cost nothing, by his own kin. \u201cNothing,\u201d Jaskier hisses. \u201cNothing. It\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\u201cYour heartbeat kicked up and you reek of fear,\u201d Aubry says, which is more words than Jaskier usually gets out of him in a week. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\u201c...I know one of the envoys,\u201d Jaskier says, hedging the truth carefully. Witchers, he has learned, can smell lies. \u201cWe don\u2019t get on.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Aubry says, and lets go of his arm. To Jaskier\u2019s surprise, he adds, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. You\u2019re the White Wolf\u2019s. Nobody touches you.\u201d\nThat is surprisingly reassuring, actually. In a \u2018who is scarier\u2019 contest, the White Wolf wins against Jaskier\u2019s father without any effort at all. And if Jaskier\u2019s father tossed him away without a second thought, the White Wolf does value him. Maybe not as much as he does his Wolf Witchers or the sorceresses or even the human warriors who have joined his cause, but he does value Jaskier. He does. So fuck the Count de Lettenhove anyhow.\nJaskier\u2019s father introduces himself, and as he bows, Jaskier, watching Eskel and the White Wolf, sees both of them go still. Sees Eskel\u2019s amiable face turn for a split second to stone, and the White Wolf\u2019s glower get just that hair more intimidating. Jaskier\u2019s not the only one who catches that tiny moment, either: all along the high table, the Wolf Witchers grow tense, their friendly banter dying away to a quiet watchfulness. The head of their pack is, for some reason, displeased by the envoys. So is his right hand man. Therefore, something is wrong.\nJaskier\u2019s father doesn\u2019t seem to notice the rising tension. He reads out the letter King Vizimir has sent, all diplomatic fluff and folderol, and Eskel leads the little crowd of envoys to a table that has been brought in especially for them, between the high table and the rest of the hall. The White Wolf refused to displace any of his usual tablemates to seat the diplomats, and though Jaskier pointed out how rude that was going to be, he\u2019s bitterly grateful now. His father is seated facing away from him, which is also an unexpected boon.\nThe food is, as always, both simple and delicious. Jaskier can see that the envoys are taken back by everything - the simplicity, the tastiness, the fact that the White Wolf eats the same food as his warriors, the rowdiness of the Witchers at their long tables, the presence of Ciri in her seat at the White Wolf\u2019s left hand. Rumors of the White Wolf\u2019s daughter don\u2019t leave the fortress. Jaskier takes care never to even hint at her presence in his songs. She\u2019s been the best kept secret of Kaer Morhen, protected not just by walls and Witchers but by silence.\nNow, of course, the Redanian envoys have seen her, and her hair and her place at the White Wolf\u2019s side make her true identity unmistakeable. Jaskier gives it a month after the envoys return home before the first marriage offers start arriving. The White Wolf\u2019s daughter is a prize beyond price. He warned the White Wolf and Ciri both about the possibility, back when they first heard the envoys were on their way.\n\u201cAnyone can ask,\u201d the White Wolf had growled. \u201cCiri marries when she likes, who she likes, and anyone who doesn\u2019t like it can meet my swords.\u201d\nIt\u2019s probably going to take some very blunt rejections for the kings and dukes and emperors of the world to figure out that the White Wolf means that, but Jaskier has every faith that Ciri will grow up wild and free, and marry when and as she pleases, with her terrifying father - and her father\u2019s terrifying army - to protect her. Not to mention her own rather startling abilities, both with a blade and with magic; she has come on in leaps and bounds this past year, and even Yennefer seems a little taken aback at Ciri\u2019s growing powers, while the Witchers who train her speak admiringly of her speed and agility and ruthlessness with a blade. She\u2019s as safe - as well-defended - as any princess can be.\nThe meal ends far too soon. The White Wolf turns and looks down the long table at Jaskier, and to Jaskier\u2019s blank surprise, instead of a summons, there\u2019s a question in those golden eyes, clear enough that Jaskier can almost hear the words: Can you do this?\nYe gods, the White Wolf cares. Jaskier swallows and puts his mug down and nods sharply. He will do this. He\u2019s going to get up and sing about the burning of Ghelibol right in his father\u2019s damned face, and his father is going to have to clap and make approving noises, because Jaskier is the White Wolf\u2019s bard, under the White Wolf\u2019s protection, and nobody touches him.\nHe stands and grabs his lute off the back of the chair and slings it over his chest, and as he strikes a chord the whole hall goes silent - the Witchers in anticipatory pleasure, the envoys in what sure as hell looks like shock. Jaskier holds his head high and saunters out into the middle of the hall and starts to sing. He puts his whole heart into it, concentrates utterly on the words, on the melody, on catching the eye of each Witcher he passes so that everyone in the audience feels like he\u2019s singing to them specifically, so that the Witchers square their shoulders and sit a little taller at the reminder of their past heroics. He finishes the last chorus standing right in front of the high table, squarely before the White Wolf\u2019s seat, and turns and bows deeply to the White Wolf, his back to the envoys, pretending he cannot see the daggered looks they are throwing at him. Pretending he doesn\u2019t know them at all.\nThe warriors of Kaer Morhen applaud uproariously. The White Wolf deigns to nod, but Jaskier, after a year of learning his expressions, can see the amusement in the creases around his eyes, the worry in the slight downturn of his mouth. Jaskier grins at him - not his best grin, but good enough to fool almost anyone - and retreats back to his seat at the end of the table.\nThere are other exhibitions after his song: a group of human warriors doing a fast-paced and energetic dance, two Witchers sparring up and down one of the long tables, never putting a foot wrong despite the plates and cups littering the surface, Yennefer and Triss summoning an illusion of a greater dragon to swoop through the hall. Jaskier claps and cheers with everyone else, and tries very hard to pretend he\u2019s not paying any attention to the envoys.\nHe retreats to his rooms as soon as the formal entertainment is over, though, and for the first time since he came to Kaer Morhen, he locks the door to his bedroom before he collapses onto the bed.\nHis father. Fuck. Jaskier\u2019s not entirely sure how he\u2019s going to deal with this. With a little luck, though, he won\u2019t have to. The Count de Lettenhove won\u2019t be welcome anywhere near Ciri\u2019s lessons, and if Jaskier eats dinner down in the kitchen with the servants - which he has done before, usually when he was in the middle of composing and needed to not be distracted by loud Witchers - and spends his afternoons helping Triss...with a little luck, he can stay entirely out of the envoys\u2019 way except during supper, and they won\u2019t dare approach him while he\u2019s at the high table, nor interrupt him while he\u2019s singing. If he slips away immediately after singing, he\u2019ll be fine.\nIt works for three days, which is better than Jaskier had really expected. But on the fourth day, Triss sends him up to get something from the pantry at the same time as the diplomatic talks take their midafternoon break, and Jaskier, taking a shortcut through the main hall, comes face to face with his father.\n\u201cJulian,\u201d his father says. Jaskier squares his shoulders and braces himself for the coming nastiness.\n\u201cCount de Lettenhove,\u201d he replies, as coldly as he can. The man gave up any right to be called Father when he sent Jaskier into the White Wolf\u2019s jaws without even hesitating. That Jaskier wasn\u2019t devoured was pure luck, not any virtue of his father\u2019s brilliance.\n\u201cYou\u2019re doing well,\u201d his father says slowly, eyeing Jaskier\u2019s outfit: fine silk from the tribute wagons, well-made and expensive; new boots from the same source; rings on his fingers that Ciri has insisted look better on him than on her.\n\u201cSo I am,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cNo thanks to you.\u201d\n\u201cIt was our family\u2019s duty to make such a sacrifice,\u201d his father says, puffing up as though to impress Jaskier with his importance. Jaskier, who has spent hours every week facing the White Wolf, finds it a lot less intimidating than he used to.\n\u201cDuty,\u201d he says, thoughtfully. \u201cSo it certainly wasn\u2019t because you wanted to get rid of a...how did you put it? \u2018Useless layabout of a lute-strummer\u2019?\u201d\nThe Count de Lettenhove harrumphs. \u201cCertainly not!\u201d he snaps.\n\u201cJust a word of advice,\u201d Jaskier says. The hair on the back of his neck is rising, which means that the White Wolf is somewhere nearby. Jaskier doesn\u2019t look around. \u201cWitchers can tell if you\u2019re lying.\u201d\n\u201cBalderdash,\u201d his father sputters. \u201cNow look, boy. You\u2019re Redanian. You owe a duty to your king - to your family! I expect you at the rooms we\u2019ve been given after supper tonight - you\u2019ll be telling us everything we need to know about this Warlord.\u201d\n\u201cWill I,\u201d Jaskier says softly. \u201cA duty, hm? To the people who sacrificed me to the White Wolf?\u201d\n\u201cTo your kin and your king!\u201d his father says. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll do it, if you know what\u2019s good for you, boy.\u201d\nThere\u2019s the threat - and, as Jaskier had not quite dared to expect, there\u2019s the White Wolf, stepping out of the shadows to stand beside Jaskier, one hand on Jaskier\u2019s shoulder, just as they stood a year ago before the hall of Witchers, Jaskier\u2019s first night in Kaer Morhen.\n\u201cIf you lay a hand upon him, I will cut it off,\u201d the White Wolf says, quiet voice so rich in menace it\u2019s nearly a snarl. The Count de Lettenhove staggers backwards in shock and dismay. \u201cYou gave him to me,\u201d the White Wolf adds, even more softly, somehow even more menacingly. Jaskier is frankly impressed: this is a bardic level of vocal skill, one he didn\u2019t know the White Wolf possessed! \u201cHe is mine.\u201d\nThis time, Jaskier has absolutely no qualms about being claimed as the White Wolf\u2019s. He grins at his father, bright and merry and cruel. \u201cYou gave me away,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can hardly complain if my loyalty now lies with a far finer king than Redania\u2019s.\u201d\nThe Count de Lettenhove sputters. The White Wolf cuts him off with a low growl. \u201cGo,\u201d he says, an order and a threat, and Jaskier\u2019s father, finally registering how much danger he is in, goes stark white and flees the room.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Jaskier says when the door has closed behind his father.\nThe White Wolf lets go of his shoulder and shrugs a little. \u201cCan\u2019t let anyone mess with my bard,\u201d he says, and Jaskier finds himself grinning, bright and happy. My bard. A claim as sure as sunrise, and one Jaskier never expected to hear.\nHe doesn\u2019t bother trying to hide for the rest of the time the envoys are in Kaer Morhen. He meets their eyes squarely and he grins, because he is the White Wolf\u2019s bard and if they lay hands on him, they\u2019ll lose those hands.\nHe\u2019s pretty sure that if it wasn\u2019t done when he was sent off to be sacrificed to the White Wolf, his name will definitely be stricken from the family books now. Julian Alfred Pankratz is as good as dead to his kin.\nWell, to hell with that. He\u2019s Jaskier of Kaer Morhen, tutor to the princess Ciri, bard to the White Wolf, and anyone who doesn\u2019t like that can choke on it.\nThe White Wolf summons Jaskier the day after the Redanian envoys finally leave, and when Jaskier presents himself in the office, to his surprise, Eskel spreads a heap of parchment out on the large table, and the White Wolf rumbles, \u201cThe treaty they brought. Look it over. Any traps?\u201d\nJaskier has to admit he\u2019s utterly flattered by the level of trust being demonstrated - for his loyalty to the White Wolf, and for his intelligence and political instincts too. He leans over the table and examines each page very carefully, on the lookout for weasel-worded clauses or diplomatic double-talk or complicated lawyerese, and on the third page of the proposed treaty, he finds the first - though not, he suspects, the only - potential problem.\n\u201cHere,\u201d he says to the Witchers, who both lean over his shoulders to look. The White Wolf\u2019s breath is warm on the side of Jaskier\u2019s throat. \u201cIf you sign this, there\u2019ll be a dozen Redanian noblewomen here to court you as soon as their horses can get here, and you\u2019ll have to reject every possible lady in Redania before you can look elsewhere for a consort.\u201d\n\u201cNot looking for a consort,\u201d the White Wolf rumbles.\n\u201cThey\u2019d come even with how scared everyone is of our Wolf?\u201d Eskel asks, sounding rather surprised. \u201cEvery envoy in that group reeked of fear the whole time they were here.\u201d\nJaskier snorts. \u201cFor a chance to bag the Warlord? There are plenty of noble ladies who will douse themselves in enough perfume that you won\u2019t be able to smell the fear.\u201d\n\u201cStill reeks,\u201d the White Wolf grumbles, and takes up a quill to scratch through the offending line. \u201cYou don\u2019t,\u201d he adds, almost idly. Jaskier blinks down at the parchments in surprise.\n\u201cI don\u2019t?\u201d\n\u201cUsed to,\u201d the White Wolf says, straightening but not backing away. Jaskier can feel the warmth radiating from him, like standing near a banked hearth. \u201cNot anymore.\u201d\n\u201cYes, well, hard to be scared of someone whose daughter uses him for a climbing structure,\u201d Jaskier says, keeping his voice deliberately light.\n\u201cHm,\u201d the White Wolf says, but he sounds more amused than annoyed, so Jaskier takes it as a win and goes back to perusing the treaty draft. He finds three more issues - the last one being an attempt to get King Vizimir\u2019s grandson betrothed to Ciri, which has to have been written in after the envoys arrived, and makes both the White Wolf and Eskel growl low in their throats. Jaskier crosses that line out himself, scratching hard enough to tear the parchment.\n\u201cFrankly,\u201d he says, tossing the last page down and straightening, \u201cI think you\u2019d be better off writing your own treaty and shoving it down their fucking throats, my lord. This is bullshit.\u201d\n\u201cHm,\u201d says the White Wolf, and then, \u201cGeralt.\u201d\nJaskier turns to blink at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cMy name,\u201d the White Wolf says. \u201cNot \u2018my lord.\u2019\u201d He gestures at the parchment-strewn table, the quiet office. \u201cYou teach Ciri; you advise me. Drop the \u2018my lord\u2019 bullshit. Doesn\u2019t suit you.\u201d\nJaskier doesn\u2019t let his jaw drop, but it\u2019s a near thing. \u201cAh,\u201d he says, knowing his voice is quavering and unable to do anything about it. \u201cYes, my...Geralt.\u201d\nThe White Wolf raises an eyebrow at him, clearly amused by how that particular slip of the tongue sounded, and Jaskier can feel himself blushing, face hot enough to burn. The White Wolf doesn\u2019t say anything, though, and Eskel is kind enough to muffle his laugh with a fake cough.\n\u201cSo, writing our own?\u201d Eskel says, and Jaskier takes the excuse to look away from the White Wolf\u2019s golden eyes with immense relief.\n\u201cProbably best,\u201d he says, and grabs a spare scrap of parchment and starts scribbling. \u201cI know you want to extend the laws about not hassling nonhumans, so that needs to be first thing - this piece of trash, you see it\u2019s one of the lesser clauses, I bet they were hoping they could get it tossed out in negotiations later - but what else do you want as top priority?\u201d\n\u201cHow the fuck do you know this sort of thing?\u201d Eskel asks, frowning at the heap of parchment.\n\u201c...About the nonhuman protection laws, or about writing treaties?\u201d\n\u201cBoth,\u201d the White Wolf - Geralt - grunts. \u201cEither.\u201d\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s hard to miss the bit where you come down like a ton of bricks on anyone who messes with nonhumans,\u201d Jaskier says, frowning up at the White - Geralt. \u201cAnd I know I told you I studied the seven liberal arts at Oxenfurt. That\u2019s history and politics and all that bullshit as well as music. Got to have well-rounded nobles, right?\u201d\n\u201cHuh,\u201d Eskel says. The Whi- Geralt considers this and then shrugs a little.\n\u201cAnyway, what do you want most besides the nonhuman protection stuff?\u201d Jaskier asks, turning back to his parchment. \u201cOh, and a nonaggression pact, I suppose, though frankly anyone who\u2019d try to go to war with you is an idiot, but then again the nobility of Redania have not been impressing me with their intelligence, these last few years -\u201d\nGeralt snorts. \u201cBrains like rocks,\u201d he says. \u201cGave you away.\u201d\nJaskier loses the ability to speak for a moment, he\u2019s so utterly shocked. He\u2019s back to blushing, too, his ears so hot he thinks he could probably fry an egg on them. That was a compliment, pure and simple, unmistakable, and Jaskier does not know what to do with the fact that the White Wolf has just complimented him.\n\u201cRight!\u201d he says at last, knowing both Witchers can probably smell how embarrassed and pleased he is, and deciding to ignore it as hard as he can and hope they do too. \u201cExactly! Idiots, the lot of them. So a nonaggression pact is probably a good idea. And then anything else you think is vitally important, and then we can add in all sorts of nasty little things that you can reluctantly give up during the negotiations so you look generous and accommodating and aren\u2019t actually giving up anything you genuinely care about.\u201d\n\u201cSneaky,\u201d Eskel says approvingly. \u201cHere, put in something about acceptable forms of tribute. We don\u2019t want any idiots thinking that just because you turned out to be just what we needed, they can send just anyone along.\u201d\nJaskier does not know what to do with this - with the Witchers saying outright that he\u2019s valued. He scratches down acceptable tribute - not people and forces his voice to stay perfectly steady as he says, \u201cAlright, got that. What else?\u201d\n*\nAfter a week or so, in which Jaskier has been summoned to the White Wolf\u2019s office just about every afternoon, and has become the primary author of the treaty that they\u2019re going to shove down King Vizimir\u2019s throat, he has to admit that he is - to his own bemused pleasure - definitely one of the White Wolf\u2019s advisors. This is confirmed at supper one evening when Eskel snags his elbow and tows him along up the high table to the seat at Eskel\u2019s own right hand, only one space down from the imposing almost-throne that Geralt uses. None of the Wolf Witchers object to shifting down a bit, at least not that Jaskier can see; Lambert, on his right, just grins at him, lazy and smug, and says, \u201cGreat, now I don\u2019t have to worry about political bullshit while I\u2019m fucking eating.\u201d\nJaskier eats and makes conversation with Eskel and Lambert and sings when the meal is over, and only after Geralt has taken Ciri off to bed and Lambert is deeply involved in a dice game with a Griffin Witcher and Yennefer and Vesemir are arguing about something does he lean over to Eskel and say, as quietly as he can under the noise of dozens of warriors singing and laughing and bantering and generally making merry, \u201cWhy now?\u201d\n\u201cHm?\u201d Eskel says.\n\u201cWhy - move me up the table? Why make me an advisor?\u201d Jaskier hisses.\n\u201cOh, that,\u201d Eskel says, and lounges back in his chair with a grin. \u201c\u2018You can hardly complain if my loyalty now lies with a far finer king than Redania\u2019s.\u2019 Sound familiar?\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Jaskier says, feeling his ears heat again. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you heard that.\u201d\nEskel chuckles. \u201cMe, Yen, Vesemir...half the Wolf School\u2026\u201d He shrugs. \u201cYou\u2019ve been doing a good job with Ciri, but that might\u2019ve just been self-preservation or pride in doing your duty or even just liking kids. And you\u2019ve been giving good advice all year, making yourself useful to Triss, too; but eh, could\u2019ve just been wanting to be useful enough that we wouldn\u2019t kick you out or something. That, though. You weren\u2019t lying. You\u2019re loyal to the Wolf. That makes you one of the pack.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Jaskier says again. \u201cI. I am. Loyal to the Wolf, I mean.\u201d He is. He wasn\u2019t, when he was brought here - a year ago, he was terrified, not loyal - but a year is a long time, and the White Wolf - Geralt - is -\nWell, the rumors about the Warlord that Jaskier heard in Redania are one and all bullshit. He\u2019s not a vicious beast; he\u2019s not conquering the world for fun, or wealth, or bloodlust; he\u2019s not evil. He\u2019s a good man, a good father, a good king even if he hates being reminded that he is, technically, royalty now. He cares for his people, both those in Kaer Morhen and all the folk in the lands he\u2019s conquered, human and nonhuman, young and old. He\u2019s ruthless in war and gentle in peace and good all through, behind the gruffness and the glowering and those fierce golden eyes that still seem to see right through Jaskier every time. There\u2019s a reason Jaskier has managed to write half a song cycle about the man already, with plans for at least another few dozen songs. He\u2019s the sort of muse a bard can only dream of, handsome and noble and dangerous and kind, compelling in a way no one else Jaskier has ever met has been.\nHe\u2019s still terrifying, but somewhere along the way it started being reassuring: the sun rises, the moon changes, the White Wolf is terrifying and his enemies flee in fear before him. But Jaskier\u2019s not his enemy, and so he\u2019s behind the terrifying, protected by that as surely as by Kaer Morhen\u2019s thick walls.\n\u201cYeah, we know,\u201d Eskel says almost gently. \u201cAnd since you\u2019re pack, and you\u2019ve got knowledge we don\u2019t, skills we don\u2019t, we need you as one of the Wolf\u2019s advisors.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Jaskier says. He needs to find something else to say, some other sound to sum up his astonishment and slowly growing delight. \u201cI\u2019m - I\u2019m honored. Truly.\u201d\nEskel chuckles and stands, clapping Jaskier on the shoulder. \u201cHave to see about getting you a medallion,\u201d he says thoughtfully. \u201cIf there\u2019s going to be more envoys coming through, we want to make sure none of them get the wrong idea.\u201d He strides out of the hall, humming what Jaskier is astonished and delighted to realize is The Siege of Ard Carraigh, and Jaskier slumps back in his seat and blinks at his ale-mug and rubs his fingers across his chest.\nEvery Witcher wears a medallion, and those humans who have been accepted by a specific group of Witchers are - sometimes - given their own, smaller and unenchanted, to mark their allegiance. Yennefer and Triss and Ciri all have silver wolves\u2019 heads strung about their necks, and wear them proudly. Many of the human warriors at the long tables have bears, or griffins, or manticores. Jaskier has never actually thought he\u2019d get one, though.\nA wolf\u2019s head, marking him as the White Wolf\u2019s for everyone to see. Melitele help him, he wants that - wants it with a sudden and astonishing fervor.\nThe White Wolf has laid claim to him, and Jaskier has sworn his loyalty, and now he wants the symbol of that oath, to wear about his throat for everyone to see.\nWell, that\u2019s a new and exciting thing to learn about himself, isn\u2019t it?\n*\nWhen Jaskier gets to the White Wolf\u2019s office after dinner the next day, there\u2019s a medallion lying on the pile of parchments on the table. It\u2019s clearly new-minted, shining brightly in the lantern-light. Jaskier touches it with a single finger, almost afraid that it will still be hot enough to burn, but the metal is cool to the touch.\nGeralt hums and picks the medallion up by its chain, and Jaskier ducks his head, and the medallion settles heavy and cool against his chest. There\u2019s no particular ceremony to it - Jaskier didn\u2019t really expect one. Witchers, as far as he can tell, don\u2019t go in for such things. Jaskier tucks the medallion carefully under his chemise, where it won\u2019t get in the way as he\u2019s working. The coolness fades away, leaving it body-warm, and the unaccustomed weight of it becomes normal so quickly that that night, as Jaskier is getting ready for bed, he\u2019s almost surprised to see it about his throat. It seems right, like something he\u2019s been wearing all his life - like something he was meant to wear.\nJaskier wraps a hand around it and decides quite firmly that he will never take it off again.\n*\nJaskier usually bathes in the morning, before breakfast; Triss bathes at the same time, and a handful of the servants, and Jaskier has gotten used to starting his day with some cheerful conversation and maybe a brief race across the largest and coldest pool. He hasn\u2019t beaten Triss yet, but he will one of these days.\nThis routine breaks for the first time about two weeks after his first night at Eskel\u2019s right hand. He did bathe in the morning, as it happens, but then it was a beautiful day and Ciri insisted that if they had to talk about boring history they could at least do it outside, and she was clearly going to be utterly uncooperative if he disagreed, and it was a beautiful day, so Jaskier took her out for a walk in the meadows above the castle, and then, inevitably, there was a mud puddle.\nHe gets down to the hot springs, having delivered a moderately repentant Ciri to Yennefer, to find that he\u2019s managed - for the first time in the more than a year he\u2019s been in Kaer Morhen - to choose the same bathing hour as the Witchers use after their morning practices.\nThere are...there are a lot of naked Witchers.\nThankfully, as Triss told him so many months ago, they all seem to prefer the really hot pools, the ones that Jaskier has occasionally dipped a toe into and then retreated from hastily because he doesn\u2019t actually want to boil alive, and he finds a place in one of the moderately warm ones without any trouble, rinses his hair out and sags back against the smooth edge of the pool to relax.\nLambert splashes in beside him a few minutes later. \u201cWhat the fuck happened to you, buttercup? You looked like you\u2019d been dragged headfirst through a mudpit.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not far wrong,\u201d Jaskier says ruefully. \u201cCiri happened.\u201d\nLambert guffaws, drawing the attention of half a dozen other Witchers. To Jaskier\u2019s surprise, his quiet pool is abruptly crowded: Eskel and Aubry and Gweld and - bafflingly - Geralt all come sliding into the water around him. \u201cLittle menace get you?\u201d Gweld asks, tugging at a lock of Jaskier\u2019s hair where he apparently hasn\u2019t gotten all the mud out.\n\u201cShe found a quite remarkably deep mud puddle,\u201d Jaskier says, grinning at the redhead. \u201cI think she probably could have gone swimming in it.\u201d\n\u201cOh, up in the north pasture,\u201d Eskel says, chuckling. \u201cGood thing you didn\u2019t try to swim - there\u2019s a bloedzuiger lives at the bottom.\u201d\n\u201cA what?\u201d Jaskier squeaks. \u201cYou let a swamp monster live that close to your -\u201d he breaks off as all the Witchers except Geralt start to grin. \u201cOh. Oh, now I learn you have a sense of humor,\u201d he grumbles, not nearly as irritated as he\u2019s pretending to be, and Eskel laughs harder.\n\u201cWe cleaned out most of the dangerous shit years ago,\u201d Gweld says. \u201cAnything left, the cub could protect you easy enough.\u201d\n\u201cHmph,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cDon\u2019t you think I could defend her?\u201d\nHe gets five nearly identical dubious looks. \u201cAgainst sneaky diplomats and political traps, definitely,\u201d Eskel says after a moment. \u201cAgainst anything more physically dangerous than a particularly aggressive chicken, though\u2026\u201d he trails off as Jaskier squawks indignantly.\n\u201cHm,\u201d says Geralt, drawing all eyes. \u201cCould probably manage at least a goose.\u201d\n\u201cI genuinely don\u2019t know whether to be flattered or offended,\u201d Jaskier informs Geralt.\n\u201cFlattered. Geese are vicious,\u201d Geralt says solemnly, and the crinkles at the corners of his eyes say he\u2019s enjoying this - enjoying teasing Jaskier. Jaskier can\u2019t stop himself from grinning back.\n\u201cI got bitten by a goose once,\u201d Gweld says thoughtfully. \u201cFuckers have teeth on their tongues.\u201d\n\u201cBullshit,\u201d Lambert says, recoiling. \u201cNo fucking way!\u201d\n\u201cNo, really,\u201d Gweld says, \u201cdamn things are nasty. They hiss! Like fucking snake birds!\u201d\n\u201cThere is no fucking way they have teeth on their tongues, they\u2019re birds,\u201d Lambert says, and Jaskier pulls his legs in as Gweld, annoyed at the slight to his honesty, lunges across the pool to dunk Lambert under the water. The water sloshes wildly, and Jaskier sputters as he gets splashed in the face by a particularly violent wave. To his surprise, an arm loops around his waist and tugs him to one side, tucking him between a large body and the wall, so the wrestling match can\u2019t roll over him. Jaskier wipes the water from his eyes and manages to keep his jaw from dropping only with a great effort: the Witcher shielding him from the chaos is Geralt. Golden eyes crinkle as Geralt looks down at him.\n\u201cAlright there?\u201d Geralt murmurs. Jaskier nods mutely, throat dry. This is easily the closest he\u2019s ever been to the White Wolf; the Witcher\u2019s shoulders are like a wall, blocking out the world, and his golden eyes are warm and dangerously compelling. His arm around Jaskier\u2019s waist is a bar of iron.\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Jaskier croaks after a moment.\nGeralt taps a finger against the medallion around Jaskier\u2019s throat, the metal blood-warm against Jaskier\u2019s skin. \u201cGot to protect my bard.\u201d\n\u201cMuch appreciated,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m not sure bathing with Witchers is good for my health.\u201d\nGeralt chuckles. It\u2019s a stunningly lovely sound. Jaskier wants to hear it again. \u201cNo?\u201d\nEskel and Aubry between them pick Lambert up and fling him into a deep pool some distance away. He lands with an almighty splosh and a yelp, and several other Witchers call cheerful, filthy insults at the commotion. Gweld surfaces, spitting water, and hauls himself out of the pool to follow Lambert; Eskel snags his ankle and topples him back into their pool with another enormous splash. Geralt ducks his head to block the water from hitting Jaskier again. Jaskier feels very small, caged in against the wall by Geralt\u2019s bulk - no, not caged. Protected.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cNot unless I suddenly grow gills.\u201d\n\u201cHm,\u201d Geralt says, and shakes the water from his hair, the droplets glinting in the lantern light like diamonds. He is terrifyingly beautiful. \u201cFair.\u201d He shifts back and gives Jaskier a boost out of the water. \u201cGo get dry, little lark.\u201d\nLittle lark? Jaskier mouths to himself as he heads for the dry cavern with its bronze mirror. No one in Kaer Morhen has called him that before. He\u2019s called bard often, and buttercup when Lambert feels like being an ass (which is all the time), and little flower when Yennefer is teasing him (which is most of the time), but...little lark. He rather likes it.\nHe likes that Geralt has called him that.\nThere was a lark upon a branch, that sang and sang and sang / and there below the tree there sat a wolf as white as snow\u2026\nOh. Oh dear. Jaskier blinks at his reflection in the bronze mirror as he straightens his hair. Oh fuck. Lust is one thing - he defies anyone with eyes not to feel at least a little lust for the White Wolf in all his glory. But falling in love would be...very, very foolish indeed.\nLittle lark.\nOh dear.\nJaskier needs a few days to get his head - and heart - sorted out, so naturally there\u2019s a crisis at once. The king of Kovir, in a fit of inspired stupidity, apparently decides that since Caingorn is the smallest and least conveniently located of the White Wolf\u2019s lands, surely the Warlord won\u2019t mind if he just takes it.\nThe White Wolf minds.\nYennefer apparently gets the news by xenovox sometime in the afternoon. Geralt announces the invasion over supper and gives crisp, clear orders to his warriors. The next morning, Yennefer and whoever her contact is in Caingorn raise a portal between them, and the White Wolf leads more than three hundred Witchers through the portal at a trot. Jaskier and Ciri watch from the steps of the keep, Ciri\u2019s hand tight on Jaskier\u2019s. Her father may be the Warlord of the North, but she does not enjoy watching him go off to war.\nJaskier doesn\u2019t even bother trying to hold a proper lesson that morning. Instead, he asks Ciri to show him her favorite parts of Kaer Morhen, and spends his usual teaching hours following her up and down through narrow corridors and twisting stairways as she chatters nineteen to the dozen, pointing out the sort of landmarks and points of interest that matter to a ten-year-old girl. It is, in fact, distracting enough that they\u2019re both able to not think about the fact that Ciri\u2019s Papa has just gone off to fight.\nAt dinner, Jaskier looks around at the nearly-empty tables and shakes his head. There\u2019s a skeleton crew still in Kaer Morhen: about fifty warriors, mostly Witchers too old to go to war but easily dangerous enough to defend the keep; the trainers for the boys who will someday become Witchers themselves; the boys, maybe forty lads between eight and fourteen, all looking excited and a little scared; Triss, who is of more use making healing potions than on a battlefield; Vesemir, to keep everyone in line; and of course Jaskier himself, and Ciri. \u201cCome on,\u201d he says quietly to Ciri, and leads her down from the high table to the end of the Bear table, beckoning Triss and Vesemir and a very old Wolf Witcher whose name he has never caught to join him. Slowly, they do so, and the other people scattered through the hall in their widely-spaced usual seats come trickling over until everyone is clustered around the Bear table, close enough to talk and take comfort in each other.\nJaskier would never dare invite anyone up to the high table without Geralt\u2019s nod, but bringing Ciri down to the lower tables at a time like this seems only sensible. And everyone does seem happier, sitting together and talking rather than widely scattered and too vividly cognisant of all the empty chairs and benches.\n\u201cGood thought,\u201d Triss murmurs to him under the rumble of conversation.\n\u201cAny word from Yen?\u201d Jaskier asks softly. Several nearby Witchers give him sharp looks despite his care. Triss grimaces a little and shakes her head. Too soon, Jaskier guesses; even Witchers can\u2019t win a war in a morning. \u201cWill you take Ciri for her afternoon lessons, then?\u201d he adds, pretending that was why he was asking about Yennefer in the first place.\n\u201cIt\u2019d be my pleasure,\u201d Triss says, smiling.\n*\nWith Ciri safely off learning sorcery from Triss, Jaskier retreats to his sitting room and attempts to work on the next song in the White Wolf Rising cycle, tentatively titled Vengeance at Vengerberg. He has the story all plotted out, mostly thanks to Yennefer, and the melody pretty well nailed down, so really all that\u2019s needed are the words, but he keeps finding himself staring out the window dazedly instead of writing.\nAfter the third time he has to yank himself back to his task, he sighs and pushes the half-written scroll away and thunks his head gently on the table. Fine. Fine. He\u2019s mooning dreamily over the fucking White Wolf, because it turns out that the White Wolf is ungodly handsome and actually has a sense of humor and adores his daughter and is sweetly protective of his people, and also is ungodly handsome, has Jaskier mentioned that, and the feel of Geralt\u2019s arm around his waist yanking him to safety is a memory Jaskier isn\u2019t going to forget any time soon.\nMy lover is beyond compare / with golden eyes and moonlit hair / as fierce as winter in his wrath / a gentle summer in the bath...alright, no, that\u2019s terrible, but fuck it, Jaskier hasn\u2019t written stupid love poetry in a while. It\u2019s not like he has to show it to anyone. And maybe writing a couple of sappy, silly love songs will get this out of his head before Geralt comes back. Chance would be a fine thing.\nJaskier tugs some loose parchment close and starts to write. The words flow easily, far more easily than Vengeance at Vengerberg was - the melodies leap to his mind, like water flowing down a hill, rippling and chiming. He loses himself in the sheer joy of writing something that doesn\u2019t have to be good, doesn\u2019t even have to be done, and when he\u2019s wrung himself dry of words he sits back and grabs his lute and plays the tunes he\u2019s just scribbled down, mouthing the words without sound, laughing at his own folly. They\u2019re silly little tunes, easy to whistle or hum, and there are some flaws - he\u2019d never submit any of them for a class at Oxenfurt - but they\u2019re fun, and nobody has to know the words that go with them, right?\nIf you go out in the hills at night / there\u2019s a wolf who\u2019s waiting there / he\u2019ll hunt you over hill and height / be you fleet as deer or hare / He\u2019ll chase you \u2018neath the pale moon / he\u2019ll catch you in the shadowed dark / his silver teeth will be your doom / his golden eyes will claim your heart.\nJaskier is still humming it when he goes down to supper.\n*\nThey all crowd onto the Bear table again at supper, and after the meal is over Jaskier gets up and sings anything anyone requests - thankfully, no one suggests anything too bawdy, given that Ciri is right there - and stays up far later than he usually does, because everyone is so discombobulated by the lack of the rest of the warriors that no one wants to go to bed. Finally, when Ciri falls asleep on Vesemir\u2019s shoulder despite trying to sing along, Jaskier finishes one last song and holds up his hands to signal he\u2019s done.\n\u201cI can - help put her to bed?\u201d he offers, and Vesemir nods and picks her up, cradling her in his arms and leading the way up to Ciri\u2019s rooms. Jaskier gets the doors so Vesemir doesn\u2019t have to free a hand from the heap of limp limbs and white-blonde hair. Ciri mumbles in her sleep as Vesemir puts her down, and Jaskier unlaces her boots and lines them up neatly beside the bed, tucks a blanket over her as Vesemir sets her daggers on the table by the bed and smooths her hair out of her face.\n\u201cShe\u2019s a good kid,\u201d Jaskier says as they let themselves very quietly out of her bedroom.\n\u201cShe is a fine cub,\u201d Vesemir says, which is the most agreeable thing Jaskier has ever heard him say. \u201cThought Geralt was mad when he brought her home, but she\u2019s good for him. Good for all of us.\u201d\n\u201cHer mother\u2026?\u201d Jaskier asks, as delicately as he can.\nVesemir shakes his head. \u201cNo idea,\u201d he says, which surprises Jaskier quite a lot. \u201cWitchers are sterile. Trust Geralt to be the one who isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cShe must\u2019ve been quite a woman, to bear a child like Ciri.\u201d\n\u201cHm,\u201d Vesemir says, frowning at him. Or maybe that\u2019s just his face; Witchers, Jaskier has found, are a frowny lot. He gives Jaskier a friendly sort of clap on the shoulder as they reach the foot of the stairs. \u201cGood job today,\u201d he says gruffly. \u201cDistracting the cub, and with meals. \u2018S the first time she\u2019s really been old enough to understand where her Papa\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\u201cI hope I helped,\u201d Jaskier says.\n\u201cYou did,\u201d Vesemir says, and goes stumping off towards the Witcher sleeping quarters.\nJaskier heads to his own rooms, warm with unexpected praise, and falls asleep with a hand wrapped around his medallion, and dreams of golden eyes.\n*\nIn the morning, Triss informs him that she\u2019s heard from Yennefer and everything\u2019s going fine - or as fine as anything ever goes in war. Jaskier tells Ciri as much when he gets up to her rooms to start their lessons, and a very relieved Ciri actually manages to get some studying done - not much, but a little, and Jaskier can\u2019t exactly blame her for her distraction. They have dinner at the Bear table again, and Jaskier spends the afternoon composing. He actually gets a little work done on Vengeance, but most of what spills from his quill are love songs.\nWell. Some of them are lust songs, to be perfectly honest. The White Wolf is an obscenely attractive man, and Jaskier is only human, after all. He has several minutes of regret, halfway through one scrawled ditty, that he didn\u2019t take a good look while they were all in the bath. It seemed impolitic at the time, but now he really wishes his mental image of the White Wolf naked extended below the waist. Not that Geralt\u2019s chest isn\u2019t a thing of glory, broad and scarred as it is, but still.\nCome to think of it, Jaskier has no idea if Witcher mutations change the...below-the-belt equipment, as it were. If they give cats\u2019 eyes, there\u2019s no reason they couldn\u2019t also give cats\u2019 pricks, after all. On the other hand, Jaskier knows that several of the humans in Kaer Morhen have Witchers as lovers, which would probably not be true if such a thing were actively painful, and also all the mutations seem to have some sort of useful property - keener senses, faster healing, swifter movement - while bizarre sexual organs would have no use at all. So probably they\u2019re much like normal humans, and sex with a Witcher is much like sex with a normal human...aside from the fact that Witchers have far greater strength and stamina. Which. Well. That could end up being exhausting, but probably very, very pleasant along the way. And Jaskier has always liked a challenge.\nNot, mind you, that he\u2019s probably going to get to find out, because all this speculation about what it might be like to bed the White Wolf is, Jaskier understands this perfectly, a fantasy, not a thing which is actually going to happen in the real world. If nothing else, Jaskier is fairly sure Geralt and Yennefer have a sexual relationship of some sort, and given that and the fact that Ciri exists, Geralt is clearly interested in women, but Jaskier\u2019s never even heard a breath of a suggestion that the White Wolf is interested in men, other than the scurrilous rumors told by people who have never even laid eyes on the Warlord of the North.\nHe could ask Triss. She might know. But that would be a little too revealing, and Jaskier may wear his heart on his sleeve, but there\u2019s no reason for him to go flaunting it, is there now? And anyway this might be a fleeting sort of fancy, an idle whim that blows over in a storm of love poems and wistful sighs and then a month later you can\u2019t even remember who you were pining for. Jaskier has certainly done that before; sometimes it seems like his years at Oxenfurt went by in a flurry of light-o-loves and blissfully flinging his heart after everyone who walked by.\n(None of them ever called him little lark. None of them ever laid claim to him, put a hand on his shoulder and said mine, put a medallion around his throat and said my bard. None of them ever looked right through him with golden eyes and saw something worth keeping.)\nYes. This will definitely blow over. With a little luck, by the time Geralt gets back from what\u2019s probably going to turn into conquering Kovir, Jaskier will have written quite a lot of love songs and spent a few evenings pining dramatically while playing his lute in the windowsill and staring out at the mountains and then gotten over it.\n*\nGeralt gets back three very long weeks later, and Jaskier has not gotten over it. He\u2019s still writing love songs when he ought to be concentrating on the Wolf Rising cycle, and he\u2019s still finding himself daydreaming about golden eyes and a strong arm hauling him to safety - usually at extremely inopportune moments, such that both Ciri and Triss have asked him if he\u2019s feeling alright, given how dazed he\u2019s looking - and he\u2019s still waking up from very vivid dreams about how, exactly, enhanced strength and stamina might affect sex.\nHe may also have managed to end up in the baths at the same time as one of the female warriors who is definitely in a relationship with one of the Viper Witchers, and who is not out fighting because she has a broken leg, and have steered the conversation accidentally towards Witcher sexual habits, which might perhaps have resulted in the filthiest monologue he\u2019s ever heard. It was extremely educational in more ways than one, and Jaskier has been forced to revise his assumption that bards have the dirtiest imaginations in the world. Witchers, after all, have more time to practice.\nSo yes. Jaskier has not gotten over it.\nThe White Wolf\u2019s army comes back through a broad portal, jogging ten abreast, some of them carrying their wounded. Jaskier is waiting on the steps with Ciri, who clutches at his hand tightly and watches the Witchers come pouring into the courtyard, fidgeting desperately, until finally, last through the portal, Geralt and Eskel and Yennefer appear. Behind them, the portal collapses.\nGeralt looks...tired, Jaskier thinks. Like he\u2019s been up for days. Eskel looks just as exhausted. Yennefer is drooping a little, her usual perfect hairdo a mess and her makeup streaky as it never is. But they smile up at Ciri - and maybe a bit at Jaskier - and Ciri lets go of Jaskier\u2019s hand and bolts down the steps with a whoop to wrap her arms around her Papa\u2019s waist. Geralt goes down on one knee to embrace her. Jaskier sniffles a little - it\u2019s sweet! He\u2019s a bard! He\u2019s meant to be emotional at moments like this! - and then goes down after her to offer a shoulder to Yennefer. She gives him a brief, rueful smile and leans on him a lot harder than he expected. Eskel starts giving orders to the Witchers, sending the wounded and their carriers one way, the healthy another. Vesemir steps up beside him to help direct traffic.\nJaskier gets Yennefer to her rooms, sending a servant for food and another for a basin of warm water, and gets a bowl of soup into her before she falls asleep, quite suddenly, on his shoulder. He manages to get her into the bed, tugs off her shoes and covers her with a blanket, and goes to find Triss to tell her to check on Yennefer, because if this is more than exhaustion, he doesn\u2019t know how to deal with it.\nAnd then he sort of dithers, because what he wants to do is go find Geralt and make sure he\u2019s alright, but - Geralt could be almost anywhere. Up in Ciri\u2019s room, down in the baths, in his office, in his own rooms -\n\u201cThere you are,\u201d Eskel says, draping an arm around Jaskier\u2019s shoulders. \u201cC\u2019mon.\u201d\n*\nJaskier follows him obediently down to the hot springs, where Geralt and Ciri and Vesemir have settled in one of the human-safe pools. Geralt appears to be dozing, but he cracks one eye open as Jaskier slides into the water and asks, \u201cYen alright?\u201d\n\u201cI think she\u2019s just tired, but I asked Triss to go look her over,\u201d Jaskier reports. Geralt nods and closes his eye again.\n\u201cHeld the portal by herself,\u201d he says.\n\u201cThe...other mage?\u201d Jaskier asks. There ought to have been another. He hasn\u2019t had time to ask anyone what sort of casualty count the Witcher army had, or if they lost anyone he knows.\n\u201cWore himself out protecting her in the last battle,\u201d Eskel says. \u201cHe\u2019s fine, just out of commission for a few days.\u201d\nJaskier nods, relieved. He knows the sorcerers who came with Yennefer to join the White Wolf\u2019s army are a sort of family themselves, siblings or cousins out of love and not blood, and the loss of one of them would distress Yennefer and Triss and probably Ciri, too. \u201cSo,\u201d he says, \u201cdo I need to add Kovir to your list of holdings, o Warlord of the North?\u201d\nGeralt groans and puts a hand over his eyes. Ciri giggles. \u201cYes,\u201d Geralt says, very grumpily. \u201cIdiot king wouldn\u2019t back down.\u201d\n\u201cYou realize I\u2019m going to need a much better description than that for the songs,\u201d Jaskier says, grinning at the realization that he\u2019s teasing the White Wolf, that that\u2019s a thing he can do.\n\u201cHe was stupid. We fought. I killed him,\u201d Geralt says, voice very flat, but there are crinkles at the corners of his still-closed eyes, and Ciri giggles.\n\u201cThat is not better,\u201d Jaskier says, firmly suppressing his own laughter, and reaches over to poke Geralt in the shoulder. It\u2019s the first time he\u2019s touched Geralt, rather than the other way around. \u201cCome on, you can be more eloquent than that!\u201d\nHe moves to poke Geralt again, and Geralt\u2019s hand comes out of the water and wraps around his wrist, fast as a striking snake, the grip unbreakable but not tight enough to hurt at all. Eskel snorts.\n\u201cCaught you,\u201d Geralt says, lips actually quirking into a very small smile.\n\u201cHow do you do that without looking?\u201d Jaskier asks, wiggling his fingers idly. He\u2019s not getting his hand back anytime soon, evidently. Ciri giggles at him.\n\u201cPoor sort of Witcher he\u2019d be to need eyes when you\u2019re splashing,\u201d Eskel says. Vesemir nods.\n\u201cFascinating,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cAm I going to get my hand back, or is it yours now?\u201d\nGeralt hums. \u201cIf I give it back, you\u2019ll poke me.\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d Jaskier says, giving Ciri a broad wink. \u201cNo poking, nope, I would never do such a thing.\u201d\nCiri giggles harder.\n\u201cI do not even need to be able to hear your heartbeat to tell you\u2019re lying,\u201d Geralt says, and he\u2019s smiling properly now, not just a quirk of his lips but a real, genuine smile.\n\u201cSo you\u2019re just going to...keep my hand,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cThat might get inconvenient at some point.\u201d\n\u201cHm,\u201d says Geralt, as if considering this point carefully. Jaskier wiggles his fingers again, and then starts making shadow-puppet figures with them. Ciri laughs so hard that Eskel has to scoop her up so she won\u2019t slip under the water.\n\u201cYou could just tell me the story properly?\u201d Jaskier suggests, shifting a little closer so his arm\u2019s not quite as stretched out and relaxing back against the side of the pool. His feet tangle up with Geralt\u2019s and Eskel\u2019s and Vesemir\u2019s in the center.\n\u201cWar\u2019s a fucking terrible story,\u201d Geralt says, and he doesn\u2019t look happy now. \u201cIt was a stupid king, and a stupid war, and people died who didn\u2019t have to. It wasn\u2019t heroic or -\u201d He breaks off and scrubs his free hand over his face. \u201cFucking kings.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Jaskier says, and is, rather uncharacteristically, at a loss for words. He\u2019s never seen a war, actually. He\u2019s sung about a lot of them - has written songs about the White Wolf\u2019s wars - but it occurs to him that Geralt\u2019s campaigns do tend to, first, be against kings or lords who are genuinely monstrous, and second, result in as little loss of life as possible. He goes for the leaders of any given army, cuts off the head and sends the poor foot soldiers home to their families whenever he can.\nHuh. Wolf Rising is going to need at least two songs emphasizing the White Wolf\u2019s mercy. Maybe three. Jaskier could work in something about monster-slaying, too - oh. Oh! Interstitial songs about Witchers hunting monsters, with clear parallels to the lords and kings the White Wolf has overthrown! If he rearranges things a little bit - use the same basic tune for the main story and the hunt song associated with it -\n\u201cWelp, you\u2019ve lost the bard,\u201d Vesemir says, snorting a little. \u201cHe\u2019s off composing again.\u201d\nJaskier wiggles the fingers of his trapped hand at Vesemir dismissively; his free hand is busy scrabbling for the little slate he left with his clothes, the one he keeps in a pocket for moments of inspiration like this. Eskel makes a long arm and pushes it into Jaskier\u2019s reach, and Jaskier grabs the little piece of chalk he keeps tied to the slate and starts scribbling. After a moment he realizes he\u2019s using his left hand.\n\u201cCould we switch which hand you\u2019re keeping captive?\u201d he asks Geralt. \u201cI kind of need that one.\u201d\n\u201cHm,\u201d says Geralt, and then he does let go of Jaskier\u2019s hand, and wraps his arm around Jaskier\u2019s waist instead, tugging him sideways so he\u2019s pressed against Geralt from shoulder to thigh. Jaskier drops his chalk. This is - this is -\n\u201cRight,\u201d he says, knowing he sounds a bit strangled. \u201cEffective method of bard capture, very good, top marks.\u201d Ciri laughs at whatever expression he\u2019s wearing.\n\u201cGo back to composing, little lark,\u201d Geralt says, and Jaskier picks the chalk up in a hand that very definitely isn\u2019t shaking because he won\u2019t let it, and starts jotting down as many new ideas for his song cycle as he can before they escape, chalk flying over the slate as Ciri and Eskel talk quietly and Vesemir interjects occasional comments and Geralt -\nGeralt just lounges back against the side of the pool with his arm around Jaskier\u2019s waist and holds him, and behind the mess and noise of composing that fills Jaskier\u2019s brain, lyrics and melodies and harmonies all clamoring to be heard at once, a tiny voice is chanting, Little lark. Little lark, he called you little lark again.\nThere is, of course, a feast. It\u2019s not the night the army gets back - there\u2019s not enough time for the servants to put a feast together at such short notice, and also there are the injured to care for and everyone\u2019s exhausted and not in the mood to stay up late carousing. Instead, it\u2019s a week later, and most of the injured are at least back on their feet if not wholly healed (Witcher healing is a marvelous thing), and Jaskier, having spent the last week in a creative fugue, is ready to debut his newest song.\nIt\u2019s not about the White Wolf\u2019s defeat of the King of Kovir, as it happens. He did get the full story, from Yennefer, and it\u2019s probably going to end up being a song at some point, but it\u2019s not the song for this feast. It\u2019s one whose story he got from Vesemir, of all people, about the founding of the Wolf School and the reason Witchers exist, and it\u2019s going to be the first song in Wolf Rising. Here, it says. This is what Witchers are. This is what they are for. They stand between us and the monsters, and the finest Witcher in the world - the Wolf School\u2019s most glorious student - is the White Wolf who saw that humans, too, could be monsters, and thus fair prey.\nHe\u2019s quite proud of it. It\u2019s some of his best work, if he does say so himself, and it introduces the theme he\u2019s using for the White Wolf only right at the end, so it\u2019s a hook for the rest of the cycle, and - importantly - it has nothing to do with a stupid, ugly war brought about because a stupid king decided to make a truly idiotic decision.\nBecause Jaskier never wants to see that particular expression of weary, angry despair on Geralt\u2019s face again - never wants to hear that tone of utter furious resignation as Geralt says War\u2019s a fucking terrible story - people died who didn\u2019t have to. It\u2019s bad enough for that to have been a reaction to Jaskier\u2019s questions; if it was because of one of his songs, he\u2019d probably have to go - jump off a tower or smash his lute or something.\nSo when the feasting is over, Jaskier gets up and slings his lute over his chest and sings his godsdamned heart out, praising the Witchers and their purpose with every word, and they love it. Every Witcher in the hall is singing the chorus by the third iteration, including - Jaskier spins on his heel to look up at the high table and Eskel is singing, Yennefer and Triss are singing, Vesemir is singing, Ciri is pounding on the table and singing along two octaves higher than anyone else, and Geralt -\nOh, fuck. Jaskier stumbles, keeps his place in the song from sheer stubbornness, because Geralt is, unmistakably, singing along. And smiling.\nJaskier turns back around, because if he watches Geralt singing to one of his songs and smiling about it he is going to completely lose his composure. And the energy of the rest of the hall is enough to buoy him up until it feels like he\u2019s floating on air, keep him singing and playing and grinning, because this is a good song, a song he\u2019s proud of, and the Witchers and the human warriors and the mages and the servants are all singing along, thumping the beat on the tables and stomping their feet, and the chorus is almost loud enough to raise the roof, hundreds of voices bellowing along.\nWhen Jaskier brings the song to its final, triumphant conclusion, there\u2019s a brief pause and then a wall of sound, cheering and clapping like he\u2019s never heard before, and one of the Griffin Witchers gets up and picks him up and hugs him hard, and then he\u2019s in the middle of a scrum of Witchers, all of them clapping him on the back or ruffling his hair or hugging him, all of them laughing and cheering. He\u2019s feeling a bit mauled, actually - happily mauled, but still, some of the Witchers are forgetting that he\u2019s a poor squishy human, he\u2019s going to have bruises on his shoulders and possibly his ribs -\nAnd someone\u2019s arms slip around his waist and tug him out of the crowd, the Witchers melting away around them like magic.\n\u201cMy bard,\u201d Geralt rumbles. \u201cNo breaking him.\u201d\n\u201cWhite Wolf,\u201d comes from several dozen throats in obedient response, and Geralt tugs Jaskier back up behind the high table and installs him in his usual chair, standing behind him like he\u2019s worried someone is going to come and try to snatch Jaskier up again.\nJaskier tilts his head back against the chair and grins up at Geralt. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\u201cHm,\u201d Geralt says. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d\n\u201cFor a wonder, no,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cAnd my lute\u2019s not even dented! I must confess I didn\u2019t think it was going to elicit quite that level of response, though.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good song,\u201d Geralt says, and Jaskier feels like he\u2019s glowing. Geralt liked it. Jaskier wrote a song to please Geralt, and it worked, and Geralt called him my bard and rescued him - to be fair, only from some overenthusiastic congratulations, but still -\nYep, Jaskier\u2019s not getting over this particular bout of adoration anytime soon.\n*\nGeralt stays behind Jaskier\u2019s chair for the rest of the evening, leaning on the high wooden back and dangling his hands down to toy idly with Jaskier\u2019s hair. Jaskier tries hard not to move enough to make Geralt stop doing that, and plays dance music without singing so that the Witchers can get some of their excess energy out without having to have a cheerful brawl, which he has seen happen before. Ciri dances with every Witcher who will partner her, which is basically all of them, and Yennefer drags Vesemir out onto the dance floor, and Triss does the same to Lambert, and Jaskier taps his feet under the table and plays the bounciest, happiest music he knows, and it\u2019s a really, really good night.\nCiri tires out first, naturally - Witcher\u2019s daughter or no, she\u2019s only ten. When she starts drooping, Eskel scoops her off the dance floor and carries her to Geralt, who takes her carefully on his hip - she leans her head against his shoulder and dozes off almost immediately - and then tugs Jaskier gently out of his chair. \u201cCome on, little lark,\u201d he says, and Jaskier follows him, baffled but willing. The Witchers have started doing a sort of stomping dance that doesn\u2019t require any music, anyhow, and Jaskier\u2019s sure they can amuse themselves for the rest of the night, and his fingers are starting to cramp a bit.\nGeralt puts Ciri to bed very carefully, handling her like she\u2019s fragile - no, Jaskier decides, like she\u2019s the most precious thing in the world, which of course she is. It\u2019s very sweet, and Jaskier has to admit it doesn\u2019t help dampen the fires of adoration in his chest, seeing the great White Wolf care for his cub so tenderly.\nOnce Geralt closes the door to Ciri\u2019s room gently behind him, Jaskier can\u2019t quite help teasing, because he\u2019s very confused as to why he was brought along for this, and he babbles when he\u2019s confused. \u201cGoing to tuck me in, too?\u201d\n\u201cHm,\u201d Geralt says, and looks Jaskier up and down, golden eyes somehow even more piercing than usual. \u201cI could,\u201d he says, and steps forward, and Jaskier backs up instinctively until he hits the wall, with the White Wolf looming over him, arms braced against the wall on either side of Jaskier\u2019s head. \u201cLittle lark,\u201d Geralt rumbles, low and soft and very, very worryingly appealing, \u201cshould I put you to bed? Or take you to bed?\u201d\nJaskier gapes. That - he - he can\u2019t possibly be interpreting that correctly, and yet there is no possible other interpretation he can think of. This has got to be a dream, or possibly a hallucination, and either way, he\u2019s not going to pass up on what\u2019s probably his only chance to ever have one of his fantasies come to life.\nHe knots both hands in the collar of Geralt\u2019s shirt, and hauls him down into the messiest, filthiest, hungriest kiss Jaskier knows how to give. Geralt seems surprised for a moment, and then he growls a little into the kiss and everything is teeth and tongues and it\u2019s so good.\n\u201cTake me to bed,\u201d he gasps when Geralt pulls away a little to bite kisses down his jawline to his throat. \u201cOh fuck, Geralt, take me to bed.\u201d\n\u201cHm,\u201d Geralt says, and steps back, and loops an arm around Jaskier\u2019s waist to steer him down the stairs.\n*\nJaskier has never actually been in Geralt\u2019s rooms before. It\u2019s never come up. He wasn\u2019t even entirely sure where they were.\nAs it happens, they\u2019re at the base of the tower where Ciri\u2019s rooms are, and they\u2019re not nearly as opulent as most people might expect the private chambers of the Warlord of the North to be. They\u2019re comfortable, to be sure - warm and cozy, and the bed is large enough for several Witchers to roll around in - but not fancy. There\u2019s a stand to one side for Geralt\u2019s swords and armor, and shelves with books about monsters and war tactics, and a child\u2019s doll propped up on the fireplace mantle looking slightly forlorn.\nJaskier puts his lute down next to Geralt\u2019s armor stand and turns to see Geralt watching him with, for a change, a very readable expression. Jaskier knows what lust looks like, and he has rarely seen it so clearly as on Geralt\u2019s face right now.\nThis has to be a dream. First he writes the best song of his life, and is given uproarious acclaim, and then the White Wolf himself, object of the last almost-a-year\u2019s worth of Jaskier\u2019s fantasies, wants to fuck him?\nWell. Alright, Jaskier is going to have a really good dream then.\nHe saunters across the room to Geralt, getting right up in his personal space, and grins. \u201cSo. Here we are.\u201d\n\u201cHere we are,\u201d Geralt agrees, and loops an arm around Jaskier\u2019s waist to pull him close. \u201cLittle lark; do you sing so sweetly in bed, too?\u201d\n\u201cUm,\u201d Jaskier says, a little astonished at how terrifyingly arousing that sentence was. \u201cI guess you\u2019ll find out, won\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cThat is the plan,\u201d Geralt says, nosing gently at the curve of Jaskier\u2019s ear, breathing in deeply like he\u2019s savoring Jaskier\u2019s scent. Jaskier can\u2019t decide where to put his hands and eventually does what he\u2019s been wanting to for a while, and laces his fingers through Geralt\u2019s moon-white hair. It\u2019s astonishingly soft. \u201cFuck. You smell\u2026\u201d\nHe trails off, and Jaskier panics a bit. \u201cI smell?\u201d\n\u201cSo good,\u201d Geralt growls, and alright, that\u2019s reassuring, and also ridiculously arousing.\n\u201cWhat do I smell like?\u201d Jaskier asks. Geralt hums and noses his way down Jaskier\u2019s throat. Jaskier tips his head back to give Geralt better access, and Geralt makes such a satisfied sound that Jaskier\u2019s knees almost give out.\n\u201cHappiness,\u201d Geralt murmurs. \u201cAnd lust.\u201d\n\u201cHuh,\u201d Jaskier says, making a mental note to ask about the range of emotions Witchers can sense. \u201cWell, that is a fairly accurate assessment of my current emotional state, yes.\u201d\n\u201cHm,\u201d says Geralt, sounding amused, and then he kisses Jaskier, and it\u2019s -\nIt\u2019s just overwhelming, is what it is. There are teeth happening, and tongues, and Geralt\u2019s arms holding Jaskier up despite his wobbly knees, and the way Geralt growls softly into Jaskier\u2019s mouth when Jaskier inadvertently yanks on his hair a little. \u201cBed,\u201d Jaskier gasps when Geralt breaks the kiss to mouth down his throat again - oh fuck teeth, Jaskier yanks at Geralt\u2019s hair on purpose this time because biting yes please but also a little warning might be nice - \u201cBed, I am going to fall over if we don\u2019t get horizontal.\u201d\n\u201cWill you now,\u201d Geralt says, and picks him up.\nWell, that...that works, yes, that works quite well, Jaskier is not going to complain about Witcher strength, he is not complaining and also he is definitely running several of the things Zofia told him about the sexual uses of Witcher strength over in his mind as things that he might get to try in the relatively near future. Jaskier wraps his legs around Geralt\u2019s waist and kisses him again. Geralt rumbles happily, a deep sound somewhere between a groan and a growl, and starts moving slowly across the room towards the enormous bed, one careful step at a time as though he\u2019s afraid he\u2019ll startle Jaskier if he moves too fast. As if any power in the world could get Jaskier to willingly leave this room right now.\nGeralt puts him down on the bed and pulls back just an inch or two from the kiss until he can rest their foreheads together. \u201cWhat do you like, little lark?\u201d\n\u201cUh?\u201d Jaskier says, attempting to find some coherence somewhere. \u201cLike?\u201d\n\u201cIn bed,\u201d Geralt says patiently.\n\u201cAlmost anything?\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cFucking, being fucked, mouths, hands - I like almost anything, Geralt, and right now I\u2019d like you.\u201d\nGeralt\u2019s eyes are nearly black, the gold a thin ring around lust-blown pupils. \u201cReckless,\u201d he says, sounding amused and fond, and takes a half-step back, hands going to the fastenings of his clothes. Jaskier watches dazedly for a moment until Geralt\u2019s soft chuckle rouses him into motion, and then he does his best to get his clothes off faster than he ever has before. He\u2019s down to just his chemise when he looks up and his breath goes whooshing from his chest like it\u2019s been punched out of him.\nGeralt, naked, is the kind of beauty that inspires statue-carvers and painters and - naturally - bards. He\u2019s all muscle and sinew, scarred pale flesh and moon-white hair, and a prick that makes Jaskier\u2019s mouth water and his eyes go wide. Of course the White Wolf is hung like a god. Of course he looks like every one of Jaskier\u2019s fantasies come true.\n\u201cI am going,\u201d Jaskier says slowly, \u201cto write you so many songs.\u201d\nGeralt laughs, low and lovely. \u201cNot about this, little lark,\u201d he says, and crawls onto the bed, tipping Jaskier over onto his back and moving to cover him, shoulders blocking out the rest of the world.\n\u201cYou keep calling me that,\u201d Jaskier says breathlessly, hands fluttering between Geralt\u2019s hair and shoulders and the broad expanse of his chest.\n\u201cYou like it.\u201d\n\u201cI - well - yes, I do, how do you - you can smell it, can\u2019t you,\u201d Jaskier says, laughing. \u201cYou can smell how much I like it.\u201d\nGeralt grins. \u201cLittle lark,\u201d he says, voice somehow getting lower. \u201cMy little lark. My bard.\u201d\nAnd Jaskier, who has never known when to stop pushing, remembers the very first time he called Geralt by his name, and grins fearlessly up into golden eyes, and says, \u201cMy Geralt.\u201d\n\u201cHm,\u201d Geralt says, smug and pleased, and kisses Jaskier again. \u201cBold little lark, laying claim to a Witcher.\u201d\n\u201cAnd why shouldn\u2019t I be bold?\u201d Jaskier asks as Geralt begins biting his way down his throat. \u201cHere I am in the White Wolf\u2019s den, ready to be - oh fuck - devoured -\u201d\nGeralt sits back on his heels, knees on either side of Jaskier's hips, and tugs at the collar of Jaskier\u2019s chemise. \u201cTake this off before I tear it off.\u201d\nJaskier has four more chemises in his wardrobe and also has made friends with the very nice lady who made his most recent outfit, she won\u2019t mind if he needs to ask her for another chemise, and also sweet Melitele that\u2019s ridiculously hot. \u201cTear it,\u201d he gasps.\nGeralt\u2019s grin gets toothier, and he takes the chemise in both hands and rips it apart. Jaskier makes a very undignified squeaking sound. Geralt hums in satisfaction, and Jaskier -\nWell, he knows he isn\u2019t the sort of picture of masculine perfection that Geralt is, though a year of trotting up and down the stairs of Kaer Morhen has done wonders for his legs, and playing the lute every day does mean he\u2019s got surprising strength in his fingers and his arms and chest are perfectly respectable, if not to Witcher standards, but honestly Jaskier has about half a second of being nervous about whether Geralt is going to like what he sees before all of his nerves are entirely wiped away by the low, lustful growl that rises from Geralt\u2019s chest and the expression of raw hunger on Geralt\u2019s handsome face. Jaskier may have been joking about being devoured, but it\u2019s looking a little more like an actual possibility. In, Jaskier is entirely sure, the sexual sense, thank you very much.\n\u201cMy little lark,\u201d Geralt says, and falls on him like the wolf he\u2019s named for. Jaskier likes to think he\u2019s a damn good lover, alright, he has skills, his hands and his mouth are finely-tuned instruments and he is a master bard, but under the sudden onslaught of hands and teeth and tongue and the low purring rumble of Geralt\u2019s satisfaction, Jaskier can\u2019t do much more than get his hands back in Geralt\u2019s hair and hang on for the ride.\nGeralt leaves bites all down Jaskier\u2019s sides, runs his hands over what feels like every inch of Jaskier\u2019s skin, shifts down the bed to shoulder Jaskier\u2019s legs apart and ducks his head and -\nApparently Witchers - or at least this Witcher - don\u2019t have gag reflexes. Who knew? Jaskier thumps his head against the pillow beneath him and yells in startled pleasure, and Geralt hums around his prick, and alright, that\u2019s - that\u2019s really, really terrifyingly good -\n\u201cGeralt,\u201d he gasps, and Geralt hums again, which doesn\u2019t help at all. Jaskier yanks a little harder on Geralt\u2019s hair. \u201cThis is going to be over much too soon if you keep doing oh fuck that!\u201d\nGeralt raises his head and grins - well - wolfishly up at Jaskier. \u201cWe have all night, little lark,\u201d he purrs. \u201cThis is just to take the edge off.\u201d And he lowers his head again, and for a man who doesn\u2019t talk much, he\u2019s got a hell of a clever tongue.\nAlso, \u2018just to take the edge off\u2019? Oh fuck, Jaskier is going to die of orgasms, but hey, that\u2019s not a bad way to go, and also Jaskier can\u2019t really think clearly enough to form any sort of coherent argument against that, so -\nHe comes with a shout that rings from the stone walls, and lies there gasping for a minute as Geralt - of course - licks him clean. \u201cRight,\u201d he says when he\u2019s caught his breath. \u201cMy turn.\u201d\nGeralt raises an eyebrow and hums, but he also lets Jaskier flip them over so Geralt is the one sprawled out on his back and Jaskier is kneeling over him. And Geralt, naked and spread out on a bed, is a vision, there are half a dozen songs clamoring to be written in the back of Jaskier\u2019s mind and all of them are so filthy he could only ever sing them in a brothel, and Jaskier\u2019s not quite sure where to start so he just - starts in the middle, flings himself joyfully into figuring out what makes Geralt moan or growl or arch up against his hands, his lips, his tongue, his teeth. Geralt gets a hand into Jaskier\u2019s hair, not to steer or even to grip but just a warm curl of palm and fingers, and lets Jaskier explore to his heart\u2019s content. So Jaskier does. He kisses every scar he can see - and oh, there are a lot of scars, more than he had noticed in the baths, but then in the baths he was trying not to stare - and runs his hands over acres of surprisingly soft skin covering unsurprisingly hard muscle, and when he\u2019s not kissing he babbles, because that\u2019s what he does, words of praise and awe and frank lust all mixed up together into what he\u2019s fairly sure is an incoherent but appreciative monologue. Geralt hums occasionally and moans occasionally, which is very flattering, and when Jaskier wraps both hands around Geralt\u2019s prick - because one is just not going to be enough - Geralt lets out a groan that seems to come from the bottom of his deep chest and shudders, which is honestly terrifyingly arousing.\nJaskier settles his knees a little better against the sheets and does his damnedest to give the best fucking handjob he\u2019s ever given, and Geralt, to his surprise and delight, is beautifully responsive, panting and groaning and arching up against his hands and finally, gloriously, coming with a long drawn-out moan and a bitten-off curse.\n\u201cThat,\u201d Jaskier says, \u201cwas gorgeous.\u201d\nGeralt huffs a laugh and props himself up on an elbow and uses the hand he\u2019s still got in Jaskier\u2019s hair to guide him into a kiss. \u201cShould\u2019ve guessed you\u2019d have good hands,\u201d he murmurs against Jaskier\u2019s lips. \u201cWant to fuck you, little lark.\u201d\nJaskier shivers, and realizes rather belatedly that he has managed to get hard again, what with the whole \u2018being allowed to do whatever he pleased to a beautiful Witcher\u2019 thing. \u201cI am entirely on board with this plan,\u201d he says breathlessly. \u201cHow d\u2019you want me?\u201d\n\u201cHm,\u201d says Geralt, and wraps his hands around Jaskier\u2019s waist and lifts him effortlessly off the bed, shifting him until he\u2019s kneeling straddling Geralt\u2019s waist. Jaskier grabs at Geralt\u2019s shoulders and moans rather a lot. Fuck, but Witcher strength is sexy.\nGeralt lets go of him with one hand and reaches out to grab something off the bedside table - a little jar of some sort of oil, apparently, because Geralt thumbs the top of it off and dips his fingers into it and lifts them, dripping, and gives Jaskier a thoughtful sort of look, one eyebrow raised, like he wants to make sure Jaskier knows what he\u2019s getting into. And yes, alright, Geralt might well have the largest prick Jaskier\u2019s ever encountered, but it\u2019s not like the mechanics are any different, so Jaskier grabs Geralt\u2019s wrist and pulls his hand down between Jaskier\u2019s legs, and Geralt chuckles and stops looking thoughtful and starts looking properly lustful again.\nHe also has very good hands, strong blunt fingers that feel amazing sinking into Jaskier, and Jaskier moans and babbles and writhes happily, at least as much as he can with Geralt\u2019s other hand firm on his hip to hold him mostly still, and gets off almost as much on the way Geralt\u2019s eyes are blown black with lust and he keeps licking his lips a little in concentration as on the hand working carefully and expertly between his legs.\nGeralt uses a lot of oil, and is a lot more patient than most of Jaskier\u2019s other partners have been, and by the time he finally slides his fingers out and pushes gently at Jaskier\u2019s hip to get him to shift down, Jaskier is half-mindless with wanting him. It\u2019s probably a good thing Geralt is holding onto him, because Jaskier is tempted to just slide down onto that magnificent prick in one fell swoop, but that would probably be a bad idea, and Geralt makes him take it slowly instead, tiny gentle thrusts that nonetheless make Jaskier shudder with pleasure. When he\u2019s finally fully seated, Geralt\u2019s eyes fall shut for a moment in ecstasy, and Jaskier braces his hands on Geralt\u2019s chest and shifts a little, just to see how it feels. Gods, he\u2019s so fucking full.\nGeralt lets him take his time, lets him rise up on his knees and sink down again in little restless motions, both of them panting with it, Jaskier moaning thinly between his teeth at how fucking good it is, until almost by accident Jaskier finds exactly the perfect angle to hit that spot, the one that makes him see stars, and then Geralt grins, showing all his teeth, and tightens his grip on Jaskier\u2019s hips to hold him in place, and starts to thrust.\nJaskier doesn\u2019t even bother trying to keep his voice down. He wails his pleasure, scrabbling at Geralt\u2019s chest and shoulders with uncoordinated hands because he has to do something with them, pinned and penetrated and fucked as he is, Geralt\u2019s thrusts perfectly aimed and just on the good side of too fucking hard, steady as a fucking metronome, Jaskier could sing to this rhythm. The thought makes him laugh even in the middle of moaning, and he gasps out a line of the bawdiest song he knows, one that really does have almost the same beat as this magnificent fucking, and Geralt laughs, ye gods, he laughs, and it\u2019s so damn beautiful, and Jaskier comes so hard his vision whites out.\nGeralt makes a positively feral noise and yanks Jaskier down and spills inside him, hot and filthy and glorious.\nJaskier collapses, utterly uncoordinated, across Geralt\u2019s chest. Geralt lies still beneath him for a long moment, shuddering through the aftershocks of orgasm, and then carefully loosens his grip on Jaskier\u2019s hips. There are going to be bruises there, Jaskier is very sure, and he is going to be absurdly proud of them. Carefully, Geralt helps Jaskier straighten his legs out, until Jaskier is draped over Geralt like a sort of very odd blanket, and then - to Jaskier\u2019s blank surprise and growing delight - Geralt wraps one arm around Jaskier\u2019s waist and combs the fingers of his other hand gently through Jaskier\u2019s hair, over and over, soothing and shockingly sweet.\n\u201cMy little lark,\u201d Geralt murmurs, breathing in long and slow - smelling them, Jaskier thinks, and grins against Geralt\u2019s throat. Presumably they now smell mostly like sex. Sex and happiness.\n\u201cMmm,\u201d he agrees, and kisses Geralt\u2019s throat, because it\u2019s there and he can. \u201cYour lark. My wolf.\u201d\n\u201cHm,\u201d Geralt says, and there\u2019s a long silence. Jaskier is nearly asleep when Geralt breathes, so softly Jaskier wouldn\u2019t have heard it if he were any farther away, \u201cYour wolf, little lark.\u201d\n*\nJaskier wakes up in the White Wolf\u2019s bed, sore and sticky and so gloriously happy that he feels like he\u2019s glowing with it, with the White Wolf himself smiling down at him. Geralt chuckles softly when Jaskier opens his eyes. \u201cMorning, little lark,\u201d he says, voice rough with sleep.\n\u201cAnd what a wonderful morning it is,\u201d Jaskier agrees, and wraps a hand around the back of Geralt\u2019s neck, and pulls him down into a kiss. Geralt, gloriously, kisses him just as thoroughly and enthusiastically as he did last night.\nJaskier doesn\u2019t know what this is, or will be - doesn\u2019t know if Geralt has other lovers, or if he is allowed other lovers, or if this is love or just infatuation on his side, love or just lust on Geralt\u2019s - but for right now, he is the White Wolf\u2019s little lark, safe in the White Wolf\u2019s den, and he is as happy as he has ever been his whole life long."
