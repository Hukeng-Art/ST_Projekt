So I. Did that.

    "text": "Hinata always flinches away. Hinata is a huge baby. To be fair, Kageyama\u2019s kind of a baby, too, and he\u2019s pretty sure if he were in Hinata\u2019s shoes he\u2019d be on the train to \u201cPissing Himself-ville\u201d as well.\n\nHe gives the idiot\u2019s head an extra-hard shake just to make absolutely sure he gets his point across. In retrospect, grabbing someone by their head and toeing the line of giving them a concussion is hardly an effective method of getting them to focus. But dear God, Hinata needs it.\n\nFinally, Kageyama untangles his fingers from Hinata\u2019s hair, and that\u2019s that. He does well enough throughout the rest of the practice match. He could do better, though. He could definitely do better. They still win, because no fucking way would they lose, but there\u2019s always room for improvement.\n\nHinata is enthusiastic about waving to his new friends as they leave Karasuno\u2019s gym, hanging out the door and calling cheerful goodbyes after them. Kageyama tosses a ball at the back of his head. He pretends he doesn\u2019t see him almost tumble through the doorway in his surprise.\n\n\u201cClean-up time, moron. You\u2019ve got to help.\u201d\n\nHinata sticks his tongue out at him, hands planted firmly on his hips. \u201cYou\u2019re just making an even bigger mess, throwing volleyballs around,\u201d he counters, but this time when the ball comes flying towards him he catches it and dashes over to a bin to put it away.\n\nKageyama grins and runs to get them brooms.\n*\nKageyama slips his shirt over his head and tosses it near where he thinks his bag is, smoothing his hair down before actually turning to get fresh clothes.\u00a0\n\nHinata materializes before him, hands behind his back as he rocks back and forth from his heels to his toes. And again. And again. \u201cYou\u2019re finished changing already?\u201d Kageyama asks blankly. He stoops to retrieve his clean shirt and tuck the dirty one into his bag.\n\n\u201cMm-hm! I win this one.\u201d Hinata\u2019s still rocking. Kageyama\u2019s pretty sure he didn\u2019t even take his jacket off while he changed clothes. That\u2019s admittedly an impressive feat.\n\nStill fidgeting.\n\n\u201cStop that,\u201d Kageyama mutters once he\u2019s actually dressed. He makes to grab Hinata\u2019s shoulder, to hold him still, and this time there\u2019s not even any menace in it, like there was during the match. Just mild irritation. Even so, Hinata jumps back so violently that he ends up on his ass in the middle of the floor.\n\nFrom the other side of the room, Tanaka chuckles loudly.\n\n\u201cAh, whoops.\u201d Hinata looks like he wants to be mortified, like he can\u2019t believe he just lost his cool like that in front of most of the team. \u201cSorry, Kageyama-kun. I thought you were gonna -- oh! Never mind.\u201d He shakes his head, drags himself to his feet, and smiles.\n\nThought he was gonna what? Kageyama squints suspiciously at him, but finishes zipping up his bag and pulls his shoes on. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. You ready to go?\u201d He\u2019s already on his way out the door anyway.\n\n*\nOf two things Kageyama Tobio is absolutely certain: One is that Hinata has a black eye. A very painful-looking one, at that, that\u2019s swollen up enough that his left eye is little more than a luminous sliver among a mass of purple-blue-black-yellow. Two is that he\u2019s lying about how he got it. As much of a clumsy idiot as he is, literally no one can run into a door hard enough to do that. He clicks his tongue aggravatedly as Hinata walks beside him on the way to the club room.\n\nSuga makes a horrified sound, muffled by his hand, when Hinata first walks in. The members already present turn to Kageyama, as though he and he alone can provide an explanation. He offers his best bitchface and shrugs.\n\n\u201cWo-oah! Did my bestest kouhai get into a fight!? How cool! You totally kicked some ass, right?\u201d Nishinoya\u2019s arm is around his shoulder before Hinata even has a chance to react.\n\nKageyama sighs and sets his bag on the floor. His senpai are truly stupid sometimes. This thought only settles itself more firmly into his head when Tanaka scrambles over and starts pothering, too.\n\nHinata waves them both off, looking almost sheepish. \u201cNo, uh...actually, I ran into a door last night at home. I didn\u2019t notice it wasn\u2019t open all the way.\u201d He laughs, rubbing the back of his neck, but something about it is off. Kageyama sits beside his bag and just stares, trying to pinpoint exactly what the problem is. There\u2019s nothing. He wishes he had Suga\u2019s analytical ability.\n\nTanaka messes up his hair before drifting back to where he\u2019d been taking his uniform from his bag. \u201cNah, we\u2019ll say you got in a fight. That\u2019s way more fun.\u201d\n\nHinata\u2019s good eye widens a bit, and he shakes his head. \u201cBut I\u2019d really rather not--\u201d\n\n\u201cNonsense!\u201d Nishinoya claps him amiably on the shoulder. \u201cWe know you\u2019re tougher than you look.\u201d\n\nKageyama is fifty different kinds of irate right now, and he\u2019s about ready to kick his own senpai and tell him to leave poor Hinata alone, because clearly something\u2019s off with him. He should\u2019ve said, \u201cYeah, that\u2019d be so cool! Like I was a real warrior! Hiya! Right, Kageyama-kun?\u201d and Kageyama would have bonked him on the head so he would stop posing like a shitty cartoon ninja. But it would\u2019ve been endearing. And it didn\u2019t happen. He ends up glowering, arm on knees and chin on arm, while Noya returns to his previous station.\n\nSuga comes over; Hinata hasn\u2019t even had a chance to start changing yet. He hooks a gentle finger under Hinata\u2019s chin and tilts his head up to survey the extent of the damage, Daichi leaning over his shoulder. \u201cHave you put ice on it?\u201d\n\nHinata nods quickly.\n\n\u201cCan you see from it?\u201d Daichi asks calmly, but something in his eyes is far from calm, and Kageyama thanks even his most distant ancestors that he\u2019s not the only one who noticed something weird.\n\nHinata shakes his head, looking vastly more uncertain than he\u2019d been a few seconds ago.\n\n\u201cDo you think you can play today?\u201d asks Suga finally, and Hinata inhales sharply.\n\n\u201cYeah, of course! I\u2019m always okay to play!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I think you should definitely sit out. Just this once!\u201d the captain adds when Hinata opens his mouth to protest. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be well enough tomorrow morning for you to function normally.\u201d\n\nHinata pouts and agrees. Just like that. Sirens roar to life in Kageyama\u2019s head, and he catches the look Suga and Daichi exchange. He didn\u2019t put up a fight. It\u2019s not because Daichi told him no. Daichi\u2019s told him he couldn\u2019t play before, and he worked his scrawny ass off for days to earn his place.\n\nHe could\u2019ve easily won this argument. But there was no argument. And that alone makes something cold and uncomfortable twist and resettle in Kageyama\u2019s chest, worming its way into his heart to make its presence known there.\n\nDaichi regains his senses. \u201cGo wait in the gym for us. Maybe help coach and sensei start setting up.\u201d\n\nHinata nods, wandering back out the door. His footsteps become receding dull thuds on the wooden stairs outside. Daichi rounds on Kageyama.\n\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no idea,\u201d Kageyama tells him, and he means it. He\u2019d like nothing more than to know why Hinata is acting so defeated all of a sudden, why he has a black eye, why the fight seems to have gone out of him completely\u2026\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll tell us when he wants to,\u201d Suga offers.\n\n\u2018When Hinata wants to\u2019 sounds too far away. Kageyama doesn\u2019t like it. At all.\n*\nHinata\u2019s the kind of person who ends up walking around the clubroom shirtless for fifteen minutes straight because he got distracted halfway through changing. One time he almost left without finishing dressing.\n\nNothing like this has happened in, by Kageyama\u2019s count, five weeks. It should be, at the very least, a semi-weekly occurrence. So it becomes his mission to see Hinata shirtless. Logical thought process swiftly informs him that this is not only creepy as fuck, but equally gay as fuck. Kageyama tells logical thought process to eat a dick and let him worry about his friend the way he wants.\n\nHis mission proves extremely difficult when he discovers Hinata\u2019s talent at hiding himself. Kageyama can legitimately watch him from the moment he opens his bag to the moment he heads off to the gym, and not once does he see his torso. How the hell he can get his shirt on but keep his jacket zipped up is something he simply cannot fathom. He abandons his mission after three practices.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t stop him from noticing the welts that litter his arm one week. Angry red and purple ones. He can definitely pick out a hand-shape just under where his sleeve ends. He wants to commit homicide at the mere thought that someone hurt Hinata.\n\nThere\u2019s no confirmation, he reminds himself. Nothing to say for sure that anyone hurt him. He\u2019s a clumsy bastard, after all. Maybe even the clumsiest bastard on the team. And just who, in their right goddamn mind, would even be able to find a reason to hurt a ray of sunshine like Hinata?\n\nNot that Kageyama can\u2019t point a finger at himself. But he never \u201churts him\u201d hurts him. He intimidates him and is rough with him, but they\u2019re teenagers, for fuck\u2019s sake; roughhousing and idiocy is what they live for. He never truly holds any ill intent toward his teammate.\n\nSo even if Hinata isn\u2019t necessarily constantly a ray of sunshine, no one should ever ever even consider harming him. Ever. No one would.\n\nOne look from Suga tells him otherwise.\n\nHis gaze travels from Hinata\u2019s arm to Kageyama\u2019s eyes as he sets up the net. And Kageyama has never, in his whole life, seen such fury in someone\u2019s eyes.\n*\n\u201cYou\u2019re limping.\u201d\n\n\u201cAm not.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhatever.\u201d\n\nHinata shouldn\u2019t be this subdued. It\u2019s frightening. They should be on the verge of exchanging blows, and well past the point of exchanging insults, but they\u2019ve walked halfway across school grounds and have barely said a word to each other.\n\n\u201cI mean, why the hell are you limping, dumbass?\u201d Kageyama elaborates after a few more seconds of silence.\n\nHinata won\u2019t look at him. \u201cI fell off my bike,\u201d he offers feebly.\n\nYeah, right. And Kageyama\u2019s a fucking circus clown. He slows a bit to accommodate Hinata\u2019s inability to put weight on his right leg. They\u2019d be racing right now, if stupid Hinata hadn\u2019t gotten hurt.\n\n\u201cBullshit,\u201d he snaps, and then it's like someone\u2019s tipped a jar of marbles. Word marbles. Word marbles that he\u2019s spent a month collecting and placing carefully in the jar because he\u2019s really damn bad at expressing himself, and maybe now isn\u2019t exactly the most opportune time to start. \u201cSomeone did that to you. Someone made you limp. Someone...someone hurt you enough to make you limp like that, and I\u2019ll bet my entire volleyball career there\u2019s some huge nasty bruise on your leg that some shithead with major fucking issues put there. I know it, Suga knows it -- hell, even the captain knows it, and I\u2019m pretty sure coach and sensei have noticed, too!\n\n\u201cWe know something is wrong, okay? Did you really think you could hide that? Because you couldn\u2019t. And...and we\u2019re gonna find out, whether you tell us or not, and I\u2019m sure Tanaka and Noya won\u2019t have a problem beating their ass into the ground. I won\u2019t, either, by the fucking way. So just sit down and fucking talk to us, you idiot.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019ve stopped walking now. Hinata gazes up at him pensively. Hinata doesn\u2019t do shit like that. Hinata insults him back, argues with him, snatches something from his hands so Kageyama will chase him. Hinata laughs. Hinata makes everything better. He doesn\u2019t...he doesn\u2019t just stare at him with sad brown eyes, looking like he hasn\u2019t had a decent night\u2019s sleep in weeks, his hair lying much flatter than it should be, his shoulders sagging way too much.\n\nHe smiles. And it\u2019s devoid of any real amusement or happiness. \u201cDon\u2019t be stupid. I\u2019m fine. I told you, I just fell off my bike.\u201d He continues on his way. \u201cQuit trying to make a big deal out of things.\u201d\n*\nIt\u2019s not a bruise. Kageyama kind of wishes it had been a bruise. But Hinata\u2019s thigh has a wad of bandages taped haphazardly to it, and Daichi once again tells him to sit out of practice, and Hinata once again agrees. Kageyama wants to scream bloody murder.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t even get much practicing done, because he\u2019s too busy sitting in the corner of the gym tossing a ball to Hinata, who sits cross-legged with his back against the wall, catching it and tossing it back. They don\u2019t talk. The quiet is disorienting.\n\n\u201cSay, um,\u201d Hinata begins, fucking finally; Kageyama thanks everything he can think to thank, \u201csay something like that actually were happening.\u201d His stomach drops again, his heart returning to its place. The cold place. The uncomfortable one. Hinata offers a shy look, head bowed slightly, ball clutched to his chest. \u201cDo you really think you guys could do something?\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you actually stupid?\u201d Kageyama asks, and he\u2019s grateful to see a spark flare in Hinata\u2019s otherwise dull eyes. It may be irritation. It may be amusement. He tosses the ball back to Kageyama. \u201cOur senpai probably want a good fight. They need to get it out of their system.\u201d Plus, y\u2019know, the whole team knows something\u2019s up, and they\u2019re about ninety-eight percent sure you\u2019re being bullied, and even fucking Tsukishima seems ready to kill someone over it. He can\u2019t really say that. It might frighten Hinata into not talking again.\n\nA lot of things, he realizes, seem to frighten Hinata lately.\n\n\u201cDo you want to go outside?\u201d he asks suddenly, and he\u2019s surprised when Hinata nods and uses the wall to pull himself back onto his feet. He sighs, dropping the ball and moving to help Hinata lean against him. He walks him out the door and into the shade of the building opposite. It\u2019s pretty damn cold, but at least it hasn\u2019t snowed yet, so they\u2019re okay to sit on the ground.\n\n\u201cSo, if I told you that someone was being kind of a huge dick to me, you guys would make them stop?\u201d Yes, of fucking course yes, how stupid could he be?\n\nKageyama grabs his hands to make him stop wringing them like that. \u201cIt\u2019s what teams are for, right?\u201d He carefully looks away, avoiding Hinata\u2019s eyes. He\u2019s not holding his hands in a way intended to be intimate, obviously. But Hinata\u2019s such a dumbass, that was probably his first thought. He grits his teeth. \u201cWhat\u2019s under the bandage?\u201d\n\nHinata\u2019s hands are gone instantly, as he draws his knees up to his chest and clamps his arms protectively around his legs. \u201cYou don\u2019t wanna see.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it something\u2026\u201d God, he doesn\u2019t want to ask. He\u2019s afraid to know. He swallows, sighs, and tries again. \u201cIs it something you did yourself?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! No.\u201d Hinata shakes his head fervently, eyes wide. \u201cThey did it. Not me.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me see, Hinata.\u201d\n\nHinata chews his lip as he shakes his head again, and what could possibly be so bad that he\u2019s hiding it even from his best friend? \u201cIt\u2019s...I don\u2019t want you to know. I didn\u2019t want anyone to know. I wouldn\u2019t have minded just the team knowing, maybe, and I was actually gonna say something, but...but they reacted so bad and I didn\u2019t want you guys doing that too and I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Kageyama watches, horrified, as tears flood his eyes instantaneously and begin to roll down his cheeks. \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone to hate me. Especially not you.\u201d\n\n\u201cUh, I\u2026\u201d Fuck, he needs to say something comforting. \u201cEr, you know, you really are a dumbass.\u201d\n\nWay to fucking blow that one, Kageyama. Maybe some streamers and party hats are in order. Or would he prefer Dunce caps? He groans when Hinata turns his head abruptly away.\n\n\u201cI mean,\u201d he mutters, pissed at himself, \u201chow the hell could you even think that anything you do could make me hate you? You\u2019ve served a ball into the back of my goddamn head. That was the breaking point. There\u2019s no way you can top that anymore.\u201d\n\nHinata sniffles and Kageyama can see a faint smile on his face. He shuffles closer to rest his hands on his shins and forces him to sit with his legs outstretched. It takes a few minutes to work his way through the bandage, given that it\u2019s essentially imprisoned inside of medical tape, but he manages, and peels back the gauze.\n\nHeavy bruising (it\u2019s green and black and splotchy and shiny) aside, someone\u2019s taken something definitely sharp and jagged and carved \u201cFAG\u201d in harsh, bold letters across his skin. Kageyama digs his fingernails into his own knee. \u201cYou cleaned it?\u201d he asks around the anger flooding his throat like lava. Hinata nods, eyes shining with tears again, and he looks so afraid, so fragile, like he expects Kageyama to snap on him or something stupid. \u201cGood. Now tell me who did it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI...you\u2019re not mad?\u201d Hinata\u2019s voice is tremulous, his eyes still fearful.\n\nKageyama sighs hopelessly. \u201cOf course not, dickhead. Why would I be?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Just, people aren\u2019t really nice about it, y\u2019know? I wasn\u2019t sure if you\u2019d be like that\u2026.\u201d\n\n\u201cHinata.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gay, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d\n\nKageyama continues to stare impatiently until Hinata straightens up suddenly and his mouth falls open. God, he\u2019s so stupid. They\u2019re both so stupid. \u201cOh.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d He isn\u2019t sure what to do besides shift the gauze and tape back into place. He leaves his hands on his legs; maybe it\u2019s comforting in some way. \u201cNow are you going to tell me who did this or no?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I can handle it okay on my own for now.\u201d\n\nKageyama could smack him. But he won\u2019t, because Hinata\u2019s seen enough violence in the last while to last him a lifetime. Instead he bows his head and heaves a sigh through gritted teeth. \u201cFucking\u2026 fine, fine. Okay. Do whatever. If you won\u2019t tell me that, then tell me how long it\u2019s been happening.\u201d\n\nHinata purses his lips. Like he actually has to think\u00a0about it. Kageyama\u2019s stomach hurts. \u201cSince, uh, the beginning of May? Maybe the end of April. The start of the school year, I guess.\u201d\n\n\u201c...What?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s...Hinata, it\u2019s November.\u201d\n\nHinata tilts his head and blinks owlishly at him. \u201cYeah?\u201d\n\nFuck, fuck, Kageyama\u2019s going to be sick. That\u2019s...he has to stop and count. That\u2019s at least seven months. That\u2019s his entire high school career so far. His head is buzzing unpleasantly, his fingers itching, his vision blurred. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell anyone?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re not really bad people beyond that, so I thought I\u2019d give them a chance to grow. I mean, I gave you a chance, and now you\u2019re my best friend. Plus, uh, I don\u2019t know how the Dean would react if I told him I was bullied for being gay.\u201d Hinata giggles, sheepish, quiet, and his eyes are still too dull for Kageyama\u2019s tastes.\n\n\u201cYou are such an idiot. You could\u2019ve...god, I don\u2019t know, you could\u2019ve told me, or the captain, or the coach, or even sensei, I don\u2019t care, you can\u2019t just let people treat you that way, you complete turd. None of us give a shit if you\u2019re gay. We\u2019re probably the gayest volleyball team in Japan. I mean, have you seen Daichi and Sugawara?\u201d Kageyama rubs his hand over his forehead. \u201cWe would\u2019ve done something.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get why you\u2019re so mad\u2026\u201d\n\nKageyama gapes at him. He has got to be kidding. He glances briefly to the sky, begging for help from whoever is listening. \u201cYou\u2019re our teammate. Nobody screws with our teammates. That\u2019s just that. How would you feel if someone told you Noya was being bullied?\u201d\n\nUnderstanding dawns on Hinata\u2019s face. \u201cReally, really mad,\u201d he muses. \u201cI\u2019d wanna kick those bullies\u2019 asses.\u201d\n\nFinally. He closes his eyes and bows his head. \u201cThat\u2019s how we feel when we see you come to practice all bruised up and act like nothing\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s silence again. It\u2019s worse out here, where the sounds of practice aren\u2019t reverberating through the gym, shoes squeaking and volleyballs bouncing along the floor. Then Hinata whimpers, and Kageyama whips around to look at him as he starts crying again. Did he fuck up? He must\u2019ve fucked up. Maybe he should\u2019ve left the talking to Suga or something. \u201cAh, shit, Hina...I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to\u2026\u201d He didn\u2019t mean to do whatever he did. Upset him, he supposes, but Hinata shakes his head and wipes his eyes.\n\nThe action is pointless, because more tears leak out to replace the ones lost. Hinata reaches out tentatively to him, still looking hard at the ground as though it holds the answers to his problems. Kageyama knows exactly what he\u2019s aiming for. His arms find their way around Hinata of their own accord, holding fast; he pulls him forward roughly so that he\u2019s almost in his lap and presses his face to his shoulder.\n\nHinata weeps against the top of his head, which is actually kind of gross because he\u2019s probably getting snot and tears everywhere. Kageyama\u2019s too focused on not crying to care.\n\nThey must stay like that for ten minutes, at least. Hinata apologizes over and over again, cries more, apologizes for making Kageyama cry -- he\u2019s not fucking crying, he\u2019s just angry, is all -- and then finally settles back down and scrubs at his eyes until they\u2019re clear.\n\n\u201cSorry. I guess I really should\u2019ve said something earlier.\u201d He\u2019s still kind of pretty much in his lap, and that\u2019s great and all except Hinata is heavy as hell and Kageyama\u2019s a wee bit uncomfortable with their close proximity. But he can\u2019t be that much of a jackass, to tell the person he\u2019s comforting to get the hell off of him, so he just keeps hugging him.\n\n\u201cYou can say something now.\u201d\n\nHinata nods. \u201cThey\u2019re in our year. Not my class, though. Class two. I tried to befriend them when school started, and one day they were talking about girls and they asked what kind of girls I found cute and I said \u2018I don\u2019t like girls\u2019 and - and I didn\u2019t think it was bad. No one at my old school cared. But then the next day they started being really terrible and it\u2019s just been getting worse.\u201d\n\nKageyama rubs careful circles on Hinata\u2019s back. That would do it, alright. He gives them a few more minutes (practice is definitely over by now; they\u2019d be cleaning up, which is a perfect opportunity) before hauling Hinata to his feet and hooking an arm around his waist to walk him back into the gym. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go talk to the captain. And the coach.\u201d\n\nAnd if those kids ever touch him again, Kageyama will end up snapping some necks.\n\nHinata only nods again, solemnly, and allows himself to be led into the gym. Fortunately, Ukai is talking to Daichi and Suga just inside the doors. The pair skid to a halt beside them, and all three look up. Kageyama gives Daichi a steady look. \u201cIs the Dean homophobic?\u201d\n\nDaichi\u2019s eyes flicker down to where Kageyama\u2019s arm is still around Hinata. Shit, he forgot about that. It\u2019s not for them, for the love of Christ, it\u2019s for Hinata, and Kageyama tries to explain with a scowl. \u201cNo, not at all. He\u2019s actually very supportive of the LGBT community at our school. Er...why?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo if someone was being bullied for being gay, he\u2019d help them?\u201d\n\nThree people turn to stare at Hinata, who tenses nervously against Kageyama. He\u2019s so dumb. It\u2019s Daichi and Sugawara they\u2019re talking to, here. Kageyama tightens his grip slightly and hopes that helps. \u201cYes. He\u2019s done it before,\u201d Suga tells them, reaching out slowly to put a hand on Hinata\u2019s shoulder. He still flinches, even though it\u2019s Sugawara and he almost cried after he stepped on a ladybug once. \u201cWould you like to go see him? I\u2019m sure he\u2019s still around.\u201d\n\nHinata, too still, too mute, shrugs and shifts closer to Kageyama. Everyone keeps staring.\n\u00a0\nIn the end, Kageyama helps Hinata to the Dean\u2019s office, and they talk in private while Kageyama waits anxiously outside the doors. When, at last, Hinata emerges, he looks vastly more bright and energized than he had just minutes earlier. Kageyama smirks. \u201cWent well?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gonna talk to them tomorrow and he says he\u2019ll at least expel them,\u201d he explains, bouncing slightly despite his limp. That\u2019s such a burden lifted from his shoulders, and Kageyama still can\u2019t stand the idea that something like that went on for so many months behind the volleyballs club\u2019s backs.\n\nHe falls into step beside him, still keeping the pace relatively slow for Hinata\u2019s comfort. \u201cGood. I hope they get arrested.\u201d\n*\nThey\u2019re the only people in the clubroom when they change out of their training clothes. Suga\u2019s promised to wait out on the steps with Daichi so they can lock up once the first years are gone.\n\nSo when Hinata tries the bullshit with his jacket again, Kageyama tears it off in one swift movement and hurls it to the ground. \u201cStop that. Stop hiding. It\u2019s all fine now.\u201d He has to physically restrain himself from reacting badly to the mess of bruises and scabs that are his torso. Whatever those kids used on his leg was apparently directed at his ribs, too, but there are no words. Just quick, severe lines. What isn\u2019t cut is dark and shining, like harsh blows with fists and harsher ones with feet. He only pictures it for a moment, but fire flares in his eyes and the set of his jaw hardens. \u201cJesus fucking\u2026\u201d He drops his face into one hand, peering at Hinata through his fingers. He\u2019s pale and dumbstruck, put off by the sudden exposure of his own body.\n\nHe means to hug him again. But the moment his arm is raised, Hinata ducks away so rapidly that they both end up freezing. It\u2019s at Hinata\u2019s apologetic smile that he thinks, \u2018fuck this\u2019 and gathers him up in his arms once again. \u201cYou really piss me off, you know?\u201d\n\nHinata laughs breezily. \u201cYou piss me off more. Asshole.\u201d\n\n\u201cHardly. You piss me off most, you absolute fuck.\u201d\n\nThey let go of each other, smiles breaking out on their faces. The captain and vice captain are waiting outside. They should really get their asses in gear.\n\n\u201cHere, put a shirt on,\u201d he grumbles, attempting to ignore the web of injuries that also adorns Hinata\u2019s back as he hands him his sweater.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind you seeing,\u201d Hinata starts, tugging the shirt down over his head and closing his bag, \u201cNot much. So you can look if you want.\u201d He fiddles momentarily with the hem of the shirt.\n\nKageyama shakes his head and drapes the jacket back around Hinata\u2019s shoulders. He won\u2019t be having any more of that doleful expression. Not after they just got everything sorted out, to some extent. How long are people usually affected after something like this? He has no clue. He just hopes it isn\u2019t very long, because few things frustrate him more than Hinata being upset.\n*\nKageyama waits by the gym doors, confused as all hell. He should\u2019ve run into Hinata by now. He should\u2019ve raced him to the doors, and then to the clubroom, and then probably back. Until the rest of the team showed up.\n\nBut he peeks inside the gym and Daichi, Suga, and Asahi are setting up nets. That\u2019s it.\n\nInstinct kicks his feet into some semblance of running. He recollects himself and sprints to the clubroom, nearly tripping up every step on the way. It\u2019s unlocked. It should be. It usually is at this time. That doesn\u2019t mean Kageyama wants it to open.\n\nHinata\u2019s already there. Kageyama takes a deep breath, carefully examining the back of his head in the dim light. His bag is laying on the floor beside him,open partially, but there\u2019s no indication that he\u2019s started getting ready for practice. \u201cHey, what the hell are you doing? We can\u2019t get to the gym before the senpai if you wait around here.\u201d\n\nHinata shrugs and sniffles softly. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m gonna practice today,\u201d he says, voice shaking.\n\nHis heart clenches, fighting the aggravating cold. Surely nothing bad could\u2019ve happened to Hinata. Maybe he\u2019s so happy to not have to deal with those assholes anymore that he\u2019s crying. Yes, that must be it. Kageyama creeps over to sit beside him, and he has to brace himself before looking at his face.\n\nYeah, that\u2019s not it. It\u2019s as bad as Kageyama\u2019s seen it. His lip is split and swollen and bleeding, purple fans out from around his nose like wings and there\u2019s sticky, barely-dried blood smeared beneath it. His eyebrow and cheekbone on the right side of his face have started to redden into the beginnings of a black eye. Kageyama reaches out, extremely slowly, deliberately, to brush his bloodied bangs from his face and examine the cut on his forehead.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t\u2026?\u201d But of course it was. No other fuckheaded punks would hurt Hinata. \u201cWhere are they?\u201d\n\nHinata shrugs again, turning away from him. He\u2019s clutching so tightly at his right arm that his knuckles are white.\n\n\u201cI thought they were being expelled.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he says under his breath. \u201cThey are. They got phone calls last night about it,. They had to come to school early, so they stopped me this morning on their way to see the Dean.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me you fought back,\u201d Kageyama growls, digging a first aid kit from the back cupboard.\n\nHinata doesn\u2019t answer him for a while. It\u2019s tense silence while he cleans the blood from his face and dabs alcohol on his forehead. Then, \u201cI stopped doing that a few months ago.\u201d\n\nKageyama sighs exasperatedly. Sometimes this kid is just too much. \u201cYou usually fight back. Haven\u2019t I told you you\u2019re a stubborn shithead? Because you\u2019re a stubborn shithead.\"\nHinata sighs, \"You\u2019re more of a stubborn shithead.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I mean,\u201d Kageyama points out, rifling around for a Band Aid.\n\nHinata is about to say something, eyebrows furrowed, mouth open, but the door flies open and their senpai scramble in, tumbling over each other and laughing boisterously. They stop dead when they see the oddball duo sitting cross-legged on the floor while Kageyama tends to Hinata\u2019s wounds. Already, Hinata has curled into himself with a gasp. It\u2019s only Tanaka and Nishinoya. Only the idiots. Also maybe their favourite teammates. But Hinata takes a few extra moments to process this.\n\n\u201cKageyama, what the hell?\u201d Tanaka wails melodramatically.\n\n\u201cWhy would you beat up Hinata?\u201d Noya cries.\n\nKageyama gapes at them. \u201cI didn\u2019t do it! I wouldn\u2019t do that!\u201d he snaps, slamming the first aid kit down. His senpai may be cool and all, but he\u2019s definitely right to acknowledge their idiocy.\n\n\u201cSo it was someone else then!\u201d\n\nTanaka's face is distorted with fury. \u201cI fucking knew it!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhose asses are we kicking?\u201d Noya cracks his knuckles and draws himself up to his full height. Which isn\u2019t much.\n\nHinata hunches over further. For a moment, Kageyama thinks he\u2019s going to be sick, and he makes to demand that he do that somewhere that isn\u2019t his lap, but he tilts his head up to gaze imploringly at Kageyama. The taller hums. \u201cThey\u2019re on the way to the Dean\u2019s office. You can probably catch up. Don\u2019t leave too many marks.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll avenge you, sunshine kouhai!\u201d Nishinoya roars, leaping out the door with Tanaka in his wake. Kageyama sees the rage on their faces and in the squaring of their shoulders, and when he turns back to Hinata, the redhead has a faint smile on his face.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re good senpai,\u201d he says softly.\n\nKageyama ruffles his hair. \u201cThe coolest. Now, shirt off.\u201d He picks up the first aid kit again.\n\nHinata is just staring.\n\n\u201cI know they got you there, too. And your legs, probably. I\u2019m not stupid. Shirt. Off.\u201d\n\nHe has to help him. That\u2019s not only awkward, but concerning, and he\u2019s as gentle as possible while he guides his arms through the sleeves. Extra careful with his right arm, which, judging by Hinata\u2019s agonized expression, might be broken. \u201cSo how many of them are there, exactly?\u201d he asks as he finds another alcohol swab and starts wiping -- carefully, carefully, because Hinata hisses and in normal circumstances he\u2019d scoff and tell him that he\u2019s a baby, but these are hardly normal circumstances -- at the scratches (actual scratches; made with someone\u2019s fingernails) on his shoulders.\n\nThere\u2019s a very faint, \u201cSo cool, Asahi-san!\u201d from outside. Hinata snorts, hushed but definitely amused.\n\n\u201cFour, usually. Sometimes only three.\u201d That\u2019s just unfair. That\u2019s unfair and they definitely fucking knew it. If he weren\u2019t so busy coddling Hinata, he\u2019d be out there helping the rest of the club. \u201cFour today, though.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re probably going to get banned from club activities, the lot of them, because Lord knows the second-years are too intense to hold back. They might get the volleyball club disbanded altogether. Wouldn\u2019t that be a story.\n\nIt\u2019s hardly any help when the door opens again and Tsukishima and Yamaguchi are silhouetted against the rising sun.\n\nTsukishima\u2019s eyes harden immediately. Kageyama could laugh. The cold-hearted Tsukishima, expressing actual concern. He waits for the other first year to talk first.\n\n\u201cHe spoke up?\u201d\n\nKageyama nods curtly.\n\n\u201cIs that why I hear--?\"\n\n\u201cThe senpai intercepted them on the way to the Dean\u2019s office.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s hardly surprised when Tsukishima dumps his bag just inside the door and nods. \u201cYou want the lights on?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u201cYup.\u201d Kageyama had forgotten they were even off, sitting here in the dimly-lit room and trying not to lose his cool.\n\nThat\u2019s the end of that. Tsukishima and Yamaguchi set off in the direction of the infuriated expletives that echo around the whole schoolyard, so damn loud, so damn pissed.\n\nIt\u2019s much easier to see what he\u2019s doing in the light. It\u2019s also easier to see all the damage to Hinata\u2019s body this way. Hinata clears his throat, catching Kageyama\u2019s attention. \u201cDid you all know?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all figured. We were waiting for you to say something, because we didn\u2019t want to upset you or something dumb like that. The senpai actually asked me to talk it out of you.\u201d He motions for Hinata to turn so he can work at the scratches on his lower back.\n\n\u201cOh. Sorry for making you guys worry.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s still wrong. He presses just a bit too hard with the swab. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to say \u2018that\u2019s stupid\u2019 or something.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t apologize.\u201d It\u2019s not his damn fault, anyway. \u201cMoron,\u201d he tacks on as an afterthought.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a moron,\u201d Hinata mutters, still curled protectively over his arm. God, he\u2019s so fucking stubborn. Honestly.\n\nThe second Kageyama is done cleaning up his back, he reaches out to touch his arm, earning himself a strained whine. \u201cIs it broken?\u201d\n\n\u201cDunno.\u201d His friend makes to shrug, but apparently thinks better of it. \u201cMaybe?\u201d\n\nHasn\u2019t he broken a bone before? Kageyama rubs his fingers under his eyes and breathes deeply. \u201cDoes it hurt like a bitch?\u201d\n\n\u201cUh, yes?\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d He\u2019d be well within his rights to take off this instant and catch the tail end of the scuffle outside. \u201cI will actually kill them.\u201d\n\n\u201cActually actually? That\u2019s illegal, Kageyama-kun.\u201d Hinata grins cheekily, some of the colour restored to his face.\n\n\u201cShut up.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou shut up.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hardly insulting when all you do is throw my own words back at me.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine. You\u2019re a bag of dicks.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s boring.\u201d\n\n\u201cA really big bag of really tiny dicks.\u201d\n\nHe laughs at that. Only a little. A tiny bit. It\u2019s barely a laugh at all. That was dumb, he reminds himself, so laughing at it would be dumb.\n\nLuck is not with him today. That should have been made clear when he found Hinata alone in the clubroom with a broken arm. Daichi and Suga show up while he\u2019s laughing at Hinata\u2019s shitty insult, and Hinata\u2019s laughing too but that\u2019s way less embarrassing for him.\n\n\u201cSorry we\u2019re late!\u201d they exclaim, darting over to Hinata with those dumb concerned-parent looks that he\u2019s seen too much of lately.\n\n\u201cWe had to make sure Nishinoya and Tanaka didn\u2019t kill someone,\u201d Suga explains.\n\n\u201cAnd that Asahi scared the hell out of them. The other guys, not our teammates,\u201d Daichi adds. All it takes for that is Asahi's presence, interestingly enough.\n\nKageyama\u2019s far from content with sitting idly by while the third-years fuss over Hinata, but he\u2019s not about to say anything. They both confirm that Hinata\u2019s arm is almost definitely broken, which leads to Daichi dashing outside to call Takeda-sensei over and ask that he drive them to the hospital, and Hinata looking distraught as he tries to figure out how many weeks without volleyball that will be.\n\nHis face swelled up really fast. It looks kind of gross now. Kageyama still won\u2019t leave, even if that means missing a chance to beat someone up, if only the tiniest bit. Hinata\u2019s got that frightened air about him still. Until it\u2019s gone, Kageyama stays put. That\u2019s just how it has to be.\n\nSuga waves him over. \u201cCould you help Hinata out to sensei\u2019s car?\u201d he asks, helping said dumbass back onto his own two feet. That\u2019s right; he hasn\u2019t checked his legs for injury yet. But he doesn\u2019t limp, he\u2019s just a bit shaky in his steps, so Kageyama keeps a firm hold on him all the way down the stairs and into the car.\n\nHe steps away once he\u2019s buckled him in and closed the door, waiting for Takeda-sensei to drive away. Suga\u2019s hand appears on his shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re not sending him to the hospital alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cGet in the car.\u201d\n\n\u201cWha--?\u201d\n\n\u201cNow.\u201d\n\nSugawara is Daichi-level scary sometimes. No wonder they get on so well. He\u2019s scrambling into the back seat beside Hinata before he registers his own actions. Hinata, despite the pain he\u2019s in, is giggling behind his good hand.\n\n\u201cShut up,\u201d he grumbles, snapping his seat belt into place.\n\n\u201cYou made Suga angryyy.\u201d Like he fucking knew he would manage that. What an asshole.\n\n\u201cYou made the whole team angry,\u201d Kageyama counters harshly. \u201cNow stop laughing and wallow with me.\u201d\n\nThey have the privilege of watching Nishinoya and Tanaka jump around as they wave them off. \u201cI punched someone for you, Hinata!\u201d Noya yells, and Tanaka nods.\n\n\u201cMe, too! You\u2019re welcome!\u201d\n\n\u201cSee, they\u2019re super-pissed.\u201d Point made, Kageyama settles back into his seat to watch Hinata. Super-pissed, and expressing it weirdly, but angry nonetheless.\n\n\u201cMm, I know. They seem really happy that they\u2019re probably gonna get suspended.\u201d\n*\nThe Dean gets one look at Hinata that afternoon and only suspends them each for a week. Since it was only Nishinoya, Tanaka, and Tsukishima that actually threw any punches, the club itself is excused from facing any penalties. His bullies (they\u2019re really quite ugly and brutish, Kageyama decides the moment he sees them, and he\u2019s glad Hinata never became properly acquainted with them) are expelled and arrested, much to the team's collective delight.\nKageyama spends the day watching Hinata bloom again under all the positive attention. His mother and sister show up to the hospital and spend hours cossetting and crying, leaving Kageyama standing awkwardly in the corner as Hinata reassures them. He\u2019s pretty sure it should be the other way around.\n\n\u201cYou...uh...you okay?\u201d he asks when they\u2019re alone again. He should really be heading home. Hinata\u2019s mom left and promised to return within an hour to take her kid home, which means Kageyama will be here alone.\n\n\u201cI feel a lot better.\u201d He looks a lot better. Wait, no, that\u2019s a lie. He looks like complete shit, all bandaged and swollen-faced and fat-lipped. But his eyes look better, and Kageyama is undeniably grateful for that. \u201cI don\u2019t have to put up with them anymore.\u201d\n\nSeven months. Kageyama\u2019s incredulous. He\u2019s only seen sunshine and happiness (and teasing and stubbornness and excitement and courage) in Hinata for so long that he never even noticed anything was off until barely two months ago. He\u2019ll admit that he\u2019s tough. Not aloud, of course.\n\nBut he\u2019ll admit it to himself.\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\nComfortable silence befalls them. Kageyama observes Hinata for a short while, picking out reawakened vitality and vigor everywhere. There\u2019s definitely a burden gone. He\u2019s completely safe now, under the volleyball club\u2019s protection for the rest of his high school career. No one\u2019s even going to consider hurting him again. A breeze disturbs the curtains covering the open window. He smells the cold in the air before he feels it.\n\n\u201cKageyama-kun, do you want to stay over at my house tonight?\u201d\n\n\u201cWould your mom be okay with that?\u201d He\u2019d love to.\n\nHinata laughs lightly. \u201cShe actually asked earlier, but you were too zoned out to notice.\u201d\n\nHe blushes and swats his arm, his good one, delicately so as not to startle him. \u201cYeah, fine. It sounds fun.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood. And you have to hold the PS3 controller with one hand, because otherwise that\u2019s cheating,\u201d he demands, gesturing to the arm that\u2019s in a cast.\n\nKageyama Tobio is not a cheater. He sticks out his tongue at Hinata. \u201cI accept your dumb challenge.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHinata is useless without his right arm, to the point that he can\u2019t get into the car on his own. It\u2019s a good fucking thing that Kageyama\u2019s with him. His mom is laughing merrily when they finally manage to open the door through Kageyama\u2019s name-calling and Hinata\u2019s insistence that he\u2019s perfectly capable of using his left arm to do shit.\n\nHe also can\u2019t brush his own teeth. Or eat his own food (thank God his mom composes herself enough to help with that), and they both fail spectacularly at playing any and every game they try so that they have to resort to watching television. He can\u2019t open his own backpack. He can\u2019t change his own clothes, but Kageyama\u2019s helped enough with that task that there\u2019s not even a question when he fights the cast through his shirt sleeve and slips his pyjama top over his head.\n\nHe\u2019ll have to learn to do these things on his own, but for now, Kageyama has no complaints about helping out a bit.\n\nWhen they finally settle in for the night, laughing over Hinata\u2019s helplessness and the mess he made of the sink, Hinata stops to look at him for a while.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he breathes, smiling, and Kageyama just hums and grins at the ceiling.\n\nAs it should be."
