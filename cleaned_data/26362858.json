    "text": "\u00a0\nJason waited until one in the morning for the Bat to leave his territory.\u00a0 He was sniffing around more than usual\u2014which meant that Jason had probably been noticed tailing Robin\u2014the Replacement around the city.\n\u00a0\nThe World\u2019s Greatest Detective.\u00a0 Jason was never going to hide from him for long.\n\u00a0\nBut the point wasn\u2019t to hide from him.\u00a0 The point was to make it exceedingly, obviously clear that Batman didn\u2019t get to have a Robin.\u00a0 Not anymore.\u00a0 And Jason was going to make that point by piling dead masks in front of his front door.\n\u00a0\nStarting with the Replacement.\n\u00a0\nBatman finally left when the Bat signal shone into the sky, and Jason left Crime Alley to go Robin hunting.\u00a0 He\u2019d been planning on extending this particular murder\u2014Bruce had replaced him, yes, but this kid had took up his uniform before his body had even been cold in the grave and Jason would not be satisfied with a quick and clean headshot.\n\u00a0\nNo, he planned stalking, ominous lurking on rooftops, and finally a slow, satisfying, and gruesome death.\n\u00a0\nBut if the Bat had begun to figure it out, Jason didn\u2019t have much time left.\u00a0 He headed straight for Robin\u2019s patrol route\u2014perhaps not today, but the baby bird\u2019s days were numbered.\u00a0 Who knows\u2014maybe he could loom out of the darkness when the kid was mid-swing, startle him enough to botch the landing and break a couple of bones.\n\u00a0\nThe only problem was that Robin was nowhere to be seen.\u00a0 Jason scowled behind the helmet, prowling around a couple of rooftops as if the caped sidekick would magically appear, but nothing.\n\u00a0\nHad Robin changed his patrol route?\u00a0 Had the Bat taken him to deal with whatever the GCPD was calling for?\u00a0 Had he never made it out on patrol in the first place?\n\u00a0\nNow severely pissed off, Jason growled and took off to backtrack through the rest of Robin\u2019s route.\u00a0 The Pit did not help with patience and he had the itching desire to break some bones.\u00a0 If they were bird bones, all the better.\n\u00a0\nZip.\u00a0 Zilch.\u00a0 Nada.\u00a0 Jason stopped a mugging by shooting the would-be mugger and still no righteous caped crusader came swinging from the darkness.\n\u00a0\nExceedingly irritated, Jason stomped his way to a gang hideout that had been getting quite active over the past few days.\u00a0 Leaving a warehouse full of bodies would both make him feel better and piss off Batman.\u00a0 Win-win.\n\u00a0\nHe was skulking around near one of the entrances, watching for any sign of movement, when he heard the scream.\n\u00a0\nHeard a kid\u2019s scream.\n\u00a0\nJason checked his ammunition with slow care as he made his way to the warehouse, silent and thrumming with rage.\u00a0 There was a skylight on the roof\u2014when would these idiot criminals learn\u2014and Jason was carefully prying one open when he heard the scream again.\n\u00a0\nDesperate, pained, terrified.\n\u00a0\nAnd then the laughter.\n\u00a0\nThe ha-ha-HA that still haunted his nightmares and every other waking moment, the electric green smile and crazed eyes and he should\u2019ve killed him when he had the chance\u2014\n\u00a0\nJason froze, half in the skylight, and choked down the sob.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t real.\u00a0 The Joker was in Arkham, his mind was playing tricks on him, and he needed to get the kid out and destroy this gang before Batman found him wandering somewhere that wasn\u2019t Crime Alley.\n\u00a0\nJason dropped onto the skywalk and headed for the center of the warehouse, where a light was swinging above a\u2014above\u2014\n\u00a0\nJason stared as a man in a purple suit swung a crowbar.\u00a0 It connected with a sickening crack and the boy tried to suppress a scream.\n\u00a0\nNo.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou know, the other one was stronger,\u201d the Joker laughed\u2014ha-ha-HA\u2014leaning the crowbar against one shoulder.\u00a0 \u201cHe never cried.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe boy wasn\u2019t struggling.\u00a0 His arms were twisted behind him and his legs looked wrong.\u00a0 The cape had been ripped off.\n\u00a0\n\nNo.\n\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut maybe you\u2019re smarter,\u201d the Joker grinned, ear to ear, and Jason couldn\u2019t suppress his shudder.\u00a0 \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll find your way out!\u201d\n\u00a0\nThere was a bomb.\u00a0 There was always a bomb.\u00a0 This was Jason\u2019s nightmare and there was always a bomb.\n\u00a0\nThe timer blinked at him.\u00a0 Five minutes.\n\u00a0\n\nNo!\n\n\u00a0\n\u201cBreak a leg!\u201d the Joker laughed and the crowbar swung down.\n\u00a0\nAnother snap\u2014an agonizing scream that died to choked whimpers.\u00a0 \u201cSee you in the next life, birdie!\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe warehouse door slammed shut with an echoing thud.\n\u00a0\nJason couldn\u2019t move.\u00a0 Jason couldn\u2019t breathe.\n\u00a0\nFour minutes, the timer blinked.\n\u00a0\nThe whimpering had faded to soft, hitched sobs.\u00a0 The boy was trying to move, trying to inch towards the door, but he hissed and shuddered with every little movement.\n\u00a0\nThe door was too far away.\u00a0 The boy had several broken bones.\u00a0 He was never going to make it.\n\u00a0\nThis was a dream.\u00a0 A nightmare.\u00a0 This wasn\u2019t real.\u00a0 Jason was going to open his eyes and he\u2019d be back in his safehouse and there would be no Joker and no bomb and no Robin desperately clawing their way to the door\u2014\n\u00a0\nThe boy let out a strangled scream as he accidentally put too much pressure on his broken legs.\u00a0 He tried to curl up, but the ropes had no give.\u00a0 He lay there, shuddering, for a long moment before he tried again.\n\u00a0\nThree minutes.\n\u00a0\nAnd again.\u00a0 And again, out of desperation that Jason could feel, that Jason knew\u2014the last, panicked instinct to survive, pushing past searing pain and fiery agony in a frantic hope that he could reach the door, that he could get out, that\u2026\n\u00a0\nThat Batman would come.\n\u00a0\nBut Batman wasn\u2019t coming.\u00a0 Batman was nowhere in sight and there were only two minutes left on the clock.\u00a0 Robin\u2014the Replacement\u2014Robin had only managed to move about ten feet.\n\u00a0\nJason was terrified.\u00a0 Jason was furious.\u00a0 Jason was not going to watch another Robin die in another warehouse, beaten and bloody, their life snuffed out in a flash of searing agony.\n\u00a0\nHe should\u2019ve killed the Joker when he had the chance.\n\u00a0\nJason moved on instinct, rappelling down to the warehouse floor.\u00a0 Robin flinched at the thud, trying to twist around as Jason spared a second to check out the bomb\u2014the many-wired thing was beyond his ability to defuse.\n\u00a0\nOne and a half minutes left.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWho\u2019s\u2014who\u2019s there?\u201d the kid said, his tone utterly failing to hide his terror.\u00a0 \u201cBatman?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot the Batman,\u201d Jason growled, scooping up the kid and trying his best to ignore the way the bones shifted.\u00a0 The Replacement cut off a startled shriek, his eyes squeezing shut as he inhaled shakily, tears dripping down his face.\n\u00a0\nJason aimed the grapple gun at the rooftop and swung up, trying to jostle the kid as little as he could.\u00a0 Despite his best efforts, the kid was breathing harshly by the time they made it out, his face pinched and pale behind the domino mask.\n\u00a0\nThe Replacement squinted his eyes when he felt the fresh air, and promptly turned two shades whiter when he caught sight of Jason\u2019s helmet.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d the kid breathed out, eyes wide.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTake a wild fucking guess, Replacement,\u201d Jason snarled, already leaping for the next rooftop.\u00a0 The kid suppressed a whimper at the movement, but blinked up at Jason with confused eyes.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, clearly disoriented, but Jason wasn\u2019t answering any more questions.\u00a0 The kid stifled a scream as Jason misjudged the landing on the next roof\u2014the kid was thinner and taller than Jason had expected\u2014and he dropped them into a crouch, curling over the kid as his internal timer wound down to zero.\n\u00a0\nBehind them, the warehouse exploded in a sudden, fiery blast.\n\u00a0\nJason tried to tell himself that he was imagining the laughter, the smoke filling his lungs, the fire burning every part of him that wasn\u2019t broken, the ringing in his eyes, the laughter\u2014\n\u00a0\nThe kid moaned and Jason tightened his grip.\u00a0 They needed to get out of here before Batman came looking.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTim hazily blinked open his eyes, confused to see faded wallpaper and a scuffed coffee table, but not yet sure why he was confused.\u00a0 There was humming coming from somewhere nearby, and the smell of something garlicky simmering on the stove.\u00a0 He felt cocooned in warmth, like a dream of being tucked into bed by his parents.\n\u00a0\nSomething was aching.\u00a0 Several somethings were aching.\u00a0 And Alfred would\u2019ve never left the coffee table in such a condition.\n\u00a0\nThe patrol.\u00a0 The trap.\u00a0 The Joker.\n\u00a0\nTim bolted upright and bit down on the scream as the throbbing aches flared into sudden agony.\u00a0 The Joker had\u2014he\u2014there was a bomb\u2014someone\u2014red?\u00a0 He remembered red\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhoa there, baby bird.\u201d\u00a0 Hands enveloped his shoulders and pushed him back on something soft. \u00a0Tim was too weak to resist the strong grip.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re going to undo all my hard work.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTim\u2019s legs were throbbing, little spasms of agony, and he squeezed his eyes shut tight as he remembered the crowbar crashing down\u2014remembered feeling it crack inside of him\u2014remembered the searing pain as he tried to drag himself to the door\u2014\n\u00a0\nBut he hadn\u2019t made it to the door.\u00a0 Someone had come\u2014someone\u2014Batman?\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot the Batman.\u201d\u00a0 And the voice had sounded furious, like it was an accusation.\n\u00a0\nHe wasn\u2019t safe, he didn\u2019t know where he was\u2014Tim lashed out and screamed when the punch connected, his broken arm shrieking in agony.\u00a0 Someone caught his arm and Tim shuddered at the too-tight grip, he was being pressed back, pinned down, he was\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u201cCalm down, Replacement\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\nWho\u2014what was he being called?\u00a0 Tim squinted up, catching light glinting off a\u2026red helmet.\n\u00a0\nThe Red Hood.\u00a0 Who\u2019d gotten into an altercation with Batman that had actually left the man shaken.\u00a0 Who Bruce had very specifically and very firmly warned Tim to stay away from.\u00a0 Who left a bloody trail of bodies behind as he stalked through Crime Alley.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGet off of me, get off, stop\u2014\u201d Tim accidentally knocked the side of his own head and froze.\n\u00a0\nHe didn\u2019t have his mask on.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t have his mask on.\n\u00a0\nHood used the moment to grab his other hand and push him back against the couch.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not attacking you, stay still!\u201d\n\u00a0\nTim stared blankly, stuck somewhere between shock and horror.\u00a0 The mask wasn\u2019t supposed to come off.\u00a0 Bruce had assured him.\u00a0 The glue was a special formula.\u00a0 The mask wasn\u2019t supposed to come off.\u00a0 The Red Hood knew who he was.\u00a0 The mask wasn\u2019t supposed to come off.\n\u00a0\nTim\u2019s cover was blown.\u00a0 He was done.\u00a0 Robin was done.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHoly shit, kid, breathe!\u00a0 I\u2019m not attacking you!\u201d\n\u00a0\nTim couldn\u2019t breathe.\u00a0 There was no air in the room.\u00a0 How could he breathe there was no air Hood knew who he was Robin was over Robin was done Tim was done\u2014\n\u00a0\nA heavy hand on his ribs, pressing down firmly and Tim squeaked as the pain built up.\u00a0 \u201cBreathe,\u201d a voice growled in his ear and Tim tried to obey, stuttering on an inhale as Hood grabbed his other hand.\n\u00a0\nHis hand pressed against a hard chest, a heartbeat thrumming against his fingers with the steady pressure of expansion and contraction.\n\u00a0\nOnce Tim\u2019s shuddering breaths had returned to something approaching stability, Hood let go and stepped back.\u00a0 Tim tried to curl away, pressing back further into the couch and covering his face with his hand as he peered at the Red Hood between his fingers.\n\u00a0\nThe man was wearing dark jeans and a hoodie and was standing at apparent ease in the apartment.\u00a0 If it hadn\u2019t been for the helmet, Tim would not have pegged this guy as a villain.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Hood asked, sounding bemused.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2014you saw my face,\u201d Tim stuttered.\u00a0 He needed to get out of here.\u00a0 He needed to tell Batman.\u00a0 He needed to\u2014Tim scrambled for his comms and realized with dawning horror that the Red Hood had gotten rid of the majority of his costume.\u00a0 The mask, the suit, the boots, the comms\u2014all Tim was left with was an unfamiliar button-up sweater over the dark leggings he wore under the suit.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t care who you are, Replacement,\u201d Hood scoffed, shaking his head and heading to where the garlicky smell was coming from.\n\u00a0\nTim must\u2019ve made a sound to indicate his incredulity, because the Hood paused mid-step before slowly turning back to him.\u00a0 Tim flinched and attempted to hide under the blanket.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d\u00a0 Hood\u2019s voice was flat and toneless and Tim couldn\u2019t help the shiver down his spine.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2014you\u2019re going to tell someone,\u201d Tim said, unsure of how to stop him.\u00a0 His chest was seizing painfully with every breath and fire was blooming in his legs.\u00a0 It hurt, it hurt so much but Tim was losing Robin and that hurt even more.\n\u00a0\nTim shuddered, remembering the Joker, the crowbar, that awful laugh and the chilling certainty that had dropped into the pit of his stomach when he\u2019d seen the timer.\n\u00a0\nHe remembered wondering if this was how Jason had died\u2014alone and hurting and so, so scared.\n\u00a0\nHe remembered the awful terror that this was what was going to break Batman, that Tim\u2019s stupid insistence on being Robin was going to get him killed the same way Jason had, and there was no one to bring Batman back this time.\n\u00a0\nBut he was alive but he lost Robin but\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u201cWho do you think I\u2019m going to tell?\u201d Hood drawled, stepping closer.\u00a0 Tim stayed very still, tracking Hood\u2019s movements\u2014the man was built like a tank and Tim could see the coiled danger in his limbs.\u00a0 \u201cThe Black Mask?\u00a0 The Penguin?\u00a0 The Joker?\u201d\u00a0 His voice hit a particular note on the name, twisting somewhere in between rage and fear.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve got a bullet to pick with every villain in this godforsaken city, baby bird, so who am I going to tell?\u201d\n\u00a0\nTim had not failed to notice that the carnage that the Red Hood left in his wake had been directed at very particular targets\u2014but it was difficult to reconcile the idea of a vigilante with the sheer number of bodies Hood left behind.\n\u00a0\n\u201cA reporter?\u201d Tim squeaked out.\n\u00a0\nHood laughed, rusty and hoarse.\u00a0 \u201cWhat about this getup makes you think I\u2019m looking for fame?\u201d he asked, gesturing to the concealing helmet and the dark clothes.\n\u00a0\nTim had noticed the distinct lack of grandstanding from Crime Alley\u2019s resident vigilante-villain\u2014until Bruce had an actual encounter with the man, Tim had been half-convinced he wasn\u2019t real.\u00a0 The Red Hood didn\u2019t leave a whole lot of witnesses behind.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThen why did you take off my mask?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Red Hood motioned around the visor of his helmet.\u00a0 Tom copied the movement, confused, and winced as he felt the edges of an impressive set of black eyes.\u00a0 The mask would\u2019ve cut painfully into the swelling.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Hood said, the tone distinctly sardonic.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Tim responded automatically to the bite\u2014and he didn\u2019t remember much beyond panicked terror and pain and awful, curling dread, but the Red Hood had gotten him out.\u00a0 \u201cI mean\u2014thank you.\u00a0 For rescuing me.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHood made a soft scoffing noise again and turned away, disappearing into the other room.\n\u00a0\nTim swallowed against a dry throat and catalogued his injuries.\u00a0 His legs felt like they were being stabbed with splinters and his broken arm was still angry about the earlier punch, but his wounds had been wrapped and his broken bones splinted.\u00a0 He wasn\u2019t tied or chained or restrained as far as he could see.\n\u00a0\nThere was a window ten steps from the couch and the Gotham skyline beyond it.\u00a0 It was getting dark out\u2014Tim had lost nearly an entire day\u2014and if he could make it to the rooftop, then maybe Batman would find him.\n\u00a0\nTim couldn\u2019t make it back home by himself.\u00a0 His legs protested at the thought of bearing his weight and his arms weren\u2019t too happy about his plan either, but they held, trembling as Tim eased off of the couch, trying not to make a single sound.\n\u00a0\nHis arm\u2014the broken one\u2014slipped as he tried to carefully lower himself down and Tim fell the remaining two inches with a painful thud.\u00a0 Tim bit down on the scream, his eyes watering, and waited, frozen still, for any sign of movement.\n\u00a0\nThere was nothing but the sound of sauce burbling and a narrow-eyed scan confirmed that Hood hadn\u2019t come out of the kitchen.\n\u00a0\nTim clenched his jaw and eased forward on the carpet.\u00a0 It was slow, painful going\u2014made worse as pressure ground into his definitely-broken ribs and caught every time his toes snagged on the carpet.\n\u00a0\nBut Tim persevered.\u00a0 He just had to get to the window.\u00a0 There was no bomb this time, so Tim could move slowly, carefully, pushing back the panic to clutch desperately to logic.\u00a0 Once he got to the roof, he could figure out where he was.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t have his comms, but he could figure out something.\u00a0 He could.\u00a0 He had to.\n\u00a0\nTim clawed forward another inch, nearly to the windowsill, and froze at the prickling sensation running down his spine.\n\u00a0\nHe choked down the sob and twisted enough to aim a glare in the right direction.\n\u00a0\nHood was leaning against the wall, arms crossed, watching him silently.\u00a0 He had made no attempt to approach but Tim curled up defensively anyway.\u00a0 \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Tim snapped as the silence stretched.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWondering if you actually believe you can reach the window, or if you\u2019re stupid enough to try anyway.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTim gritted his teeth as his eyes burned at the casual, dismissive tone.\u00a0 \u201cDid you expect me to stay like a good little abductee?\u201d he retorted.\n\u00a0\nHood didn\u2019t shift as far as Tim could track, but his posture was definitely radiating more fury.\u00a0 \u201cThank you for rescuing me,\u201d Hood mocked in a high-pitched voice and Tim winced.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou kidnapped me!\u201d Tim said, feeling a burn in his lungs as panic began to claw back control.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWould you rather I left you in that warehouse?\u201d Hood growled.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s not an excuse for abducting me!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI didn\u2019t abduct you, Replacement,\u201d Hood snapped, \u201cAnd I\u2019m certainly not keeping you here.\u00a0 If you want to leave, go.\u201d\u00a0 He flicked his fingers in the approximation of a shoo.\n\u00a0\nTim\u2019s breath caught in his throat.\u00a0 Leave.\u00a0 He was well-familiar with it.\u00a0 He\u2019d seen it from his parents every time he dared to get too close.\u00a0 He\u2019d seen it flicker on Batman\u2019s face when he first put on the suit to take to the skies\u2014and with decreasing frequency after, but the expression still crossed his face whenever he turned to Robin and remembered that it was Tim behind the mask.\n\u00a0\nTim turned away from Hood, ignoring the obstruction in his throat and the burning wetness in his eyes and the prickling down his spine, and clawed forward another inch.\u00a0 He set his jaw and inched forward a little more, until his fingers could brush the wall.\n\u00a0\nJust a little further.\u00a0 Tim pushed himself forward until he was curled up under the window and reached out one trembling, shaking hand to grasp the windowsill.\n\u00a0\nHis first attempt resulted in shrieking agony as the movement pulled at his broken ribs and Tim hissed as he readjusted his grip and braced his broken arm against his chest before he tried again.\n\u00a0\nThe second attempt went better as Tim\u2019s white-knuckled grip on the sill held as he did a one-armed pull-up, shifting his grasp as he rested his chin on the sill.\u00a0 Both his legs were shooting prickling, warning spasms as he tested the splints, trying to reach for the latch on the window\u2014\n\u00a0\nHis left leg gave a sudden, searing wrench and Tim lost his grip\u2014his broken arm slammed against the wall and Tim wasn\u2019t entirely able to strangle the scream as he had a painful reintroduction with the floor.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, this is getting physically painful to watch,\u201d Hood said from somewhere near him and Tim choked on a sob as strong arms encircled him, careful not to jostle his injuries.\n\u00a0\nHe was deposited back on the couch and Tim buried his face in the blanket as he tried to suppress the hitched sobs.\u00a0 He wasn\u2019t going to cry.\u00a0 Not here.\u00a0 Not in front of the Red Hood.\n\u00a0\nBatman needed a Robin.\u00a0 Needed him.\u00a0 And Tim couldn\u2019t even manage to get out the window.\u00a0 He knew he\u2019d forced his way into the suit, knew he wasn\u2019t as good as Dick, as good as Jason, but nothing had hammered the point home quite as well as this.\n\u00a0\nTim dropped the blanket and ignored the suspicious wet patch\u2014Hood had disappeared back into the kitchen and Tim raised his voice to be heard over the sound of something sizzling.\u00a0 \u201cCan I get a phone?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d was the brusque and not entirely unexpected reply.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPlease?\u201d Tim cleared his throat, \u201cI can call someone and get out of your way.\u201d\u00a0 No response.\u00a0 \u201cYou said you weren\u2019t keeping me here!\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Red Hood appeared in the doorway.\u00a0 \u201cDo I look like an idiot?\u00a0 You\u2019re not getting your hands on my phone.\u201d\u00a0 He went back inside the kitchen.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMy comms\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd your tracker?\u00a0 No.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou can get a burner if you\u2019re worried about\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cPlease, I just want to call\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWho?\u201d Hood reappeared in the doorway, coiled up like he was ready to lunge.\u00a0 \u201cCall who, Replacement?\u00a0 The Big, Bad Bat?\u201d\u00a0 There had been rage when he\u2019d talked about the Joker but this?\u00a0 This was hate.\u00a0 \u201cI.\u00a0 Said.\u00a0 No.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTim swallowed and dared to speak, \u201cBut Batman\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\nHood started forward so violently that Tim flinched back, banging his head on the arm of the couch as he tried to get away.\u00a0 The man was furious and Tim pressed back further as Hood stalked forward and curled a tight fist into the sweater collar.\n\u00a0\n\u201cListen to me and listen to me well, baby bird,\u201d Hood said, seething rage and pain and hurt all tangled up in vicious hate, \u201cBatman isn\u2019t going to save you.\u00a0 Get that through your thick skull before you end up just like\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\nHood cut off abruptly.\u00a0 Tim stared up at him, his heart pounding\u2014just like who?\u00a0 Like the previous Robin?\n\u00a0\nHood let go and stomped away, every motion bleeding stark, thrumming fury.\u00a0 Tim watched him leave, feeling the edges of a puzzle swimming tantalizingly just out of reach.\n\u00a0\nWho was the Red Hood?\n\u00a0\nBecause Tim could\u2019ve sworn he was going to end that statement \u2018just like me.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTim controlled his flinch as the Red Hood set down dinner, but Hood\u2019s general aura of disgruntlement bristled.\u00a0 Tim took the bowl he was handed, but made no attempt to eat.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s not poisoned,\u201d Hood said, but didn\u2019t remove his helmet and join the meal.\u00a0 Tim eyed him suspiciously.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you, kid,\u201d he said, and Tim got the feeling he was rolling his eyes behind the helmet.\n\u00a0\nLogically, if Hood wanted to poison him, he could hold him down and force-feed it to him.\u00a0 Tim took a cautious bite.\n\u00a0\nThe chili was good.\u00a0 No, it was delicious.\u00a0 Made the way Alfred liked, with slow-cooked garlic and onions and green pepper.\n\u00a0\nTim scarfed down the entire bowl to a palpable sense of bewildered amusement.\n\u00a0\nTim waited until Hood had taken the bowl back\u2014hopefully the other man had already eaten, hopefully he was in a better mood\u2014before he spoke up again.\u00a0 \u201cCould you take me to the roof?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHood stopped and turned to stare at him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe roof,\u201d Tim continued, \u201cI can get help from there, I just\u2026\u201d\u00a0 His voice trailed off as Hood tensed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHelp?\u201d Hood repeated, \u201cHelp from who?\u201d\n\u00a0\nTim didn\u2019t want to say Batman, well aware that it had set the man off the last time.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOr outside,\u201d Tim changed tack, \u201cI can get a taxi, or\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cA taxi to where?\u201d Hood pressed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHome.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd where\u2019s that, baby bird?\u201d\n\u00a0\nTim snapped his mouth shut.\u00a0 Hood looked satisfied.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOr\u2026if you just help me down to the streets,\u201d Tim tried, desperate, \u201cI can find my own way\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIn Crime Alley,\u201d Hood drawled, \u201cYou\u2019re petitioning me to push you out on the streets in Crime Alley.\u201d\n\nTim darted a quick glance at the windows, which had gone dark.\u00a0 Hood followed his gaze, and reached the same conclusion.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo you can go running back to the Bat,\u201d Hood said, his voice dropping to a growl.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2014I\u2019m very grateful for the rescue, Hood, but I\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to go back to throw your life away on his useless crusade,\u201d Hood said flatly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLook, I know you don\u2019t like Batman but\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t like?\u201d Hood laughed, grating and painful, \u201cOh, baby bird, I once thought he could do no wrong.\u201d\u00a0 His voice dropped, deeper and angrier.\u00a0 \u201cAnd then I realized I meant nothing to him.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTim winced\u2014so this guy was one of the crazier ones.\u00a0 \u201cLook, I just\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going back to him.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBatman needs a Robin,\u201d Tim said, trying to make him understand, because Batman without a Robin would quickly succumb to a self-destructive spiral.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBatman doesn\u2019t get to have a Robin,\u201d Hood said slowly, his hands curling into fists, \u201cNot when he throws them away like tissue paper.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t throw anyone away!\u201d Tim snapped back, indignant, because this guy knew nothing about Jason, knew nothing about how Bruce had buckled under the weight of his death, knew nothing of Robin and keeping Batman sane.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going back to him,\u201d Hood repeated, and this time Tim heard the threat.\u00a0 Tracked the slow saunter as Hood made his way to him, clutched the couch cushions as he went very still.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou said you won\u2019t hurt me,\u201d Tim pointed out, his voice wavering.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMaybe I lied.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTim scrambled off the couch and even the painful jarring wasn\u2019t enough to detract from his panic.\u00a0 The Red Hood stalked forward silently, bleeding murderous rage with every step.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2014you rescued me\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cPerhaps I wanted to kill you myself, Replacement,\u201d he hissed and Tim doubled his frantic crawl away, pushing himself back, staring up at Hood with a horror he couldn\u2019t hide.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy do you keep calling me that?\u201d Tim tried to deflect, tried to change the conversation, but apparently all it did was make the man angrier.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI thought you were supposed to be the smart one,\u201d Hood laughed, an awful, grating sound.\u00a0 Tim tried to inch away surreptitiously but Hood was looming over him and Tim didn\u2019t know what he did to this guy\u2014what Batman did\u2014but it was becoming apparent that the Red Hood was going to take it out of his hide, ignorant or not.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to kill me,\u201d Tim tried\u2014but his voice cracked in the middle as Hood dropped into a crouch, his hands on either side of Tim\u2019s very breakable head.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you sure about that, Replacement?\u201d Hood said softly, dangerously.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy do you keep\u2014\u201d Tim cut off hastily as Hood\u2019s hands moved, clicking open the clasps on the helmet and pulling it off.\n\u00a0\nHelmet-tousled sweaty black hair with a shocking streak of white, a domino mask\u2014was the helmet not enough?\u2014and then Tim\u2019s breath caught in his throat because he recognized that face.\n\u00a0\n\u201cRobin?\u201d\n\u00a0\nJason Todd\u2019s face went from zero to murder in less than a second and Tim flinched back, drawing his hands up instinctively.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot anymore, Replacement,\u201d Jason snarled\u2014and Tim got it now, the anger, the rage, the\u2014wait what was going on\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re dead,\u201d Tim said, blinking up at Jason.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re\u2014they buried you.\u00a0 You\u2019re dead.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJason Todd was dead.\u00a0 That was the whole reason Tim was Robin.\u00a0 Jason was beaten to death by the Joker and trapped in a warehouse that exploded and\u2014\n\u00a0\nOh.\u00a0 Oh no.\u00a0 Jason was dead.\u00a0 Tim was dead.\u00a0 This whole thing was a dying dream that Tim\u2019s mind had concocted to block out the pain, latching onto the closest Robin to give Tim some semblance of peace.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAm I dead?\u201d Tim croaked out, his breaths stuttering.\u00a0 Would it fall apart around him now that he knew?\u00a0 Was he going to end up back in the Joker\u2019s clutches, with that crowbar, with\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re not dead, Replacement.\u201d\u00a0 Jason was still glaring\u2014Jason who was alive, who was here\u2014Jason was alive.\n\u00a0\nTim\u2019s mind wasn\u2019t computing on all cylinders at the moment but the pieces finally combined to give a spark.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re alive,\u201d Tim said.\u00a0 Jason was alive.\u00a0 Robin was alive.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re alive.\u201d\u00a0 Jason was here.\u00a0 Batman didn\u2019t fail, he didn\u2019t\u2014\u201cWe need to call Bruce!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0 The murderous growl was enough to shock Tim out of his stupor.\n\u00a0\nJason was still looming over him, trapping him against the ground, his face shadowed and furious.\n\u00a0\n\u201cJason,\u201d Tim said softly, \u201cBruce needs to know you\u2019re alive.\u201d\u00a0 Batman needed his Robin back.\n\u00a0\nJason\u2019s face twisted into an expression Tim couldn\u2019t recognize.\u00a0 \u201cBatman already knows I\u2019m alive.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWhat?\u00a0 Tim stared up at Jason, certain that he misheard.\u00a0 Bruce couldn\u2019t know that Jason was alive.\u00a0 Bruce would\u2019ve found him.\u00a0 Got him home.\u00a0 Bruce wouldn\u2019t\u2014\n\u00a0\nBatman had been afraid of the Red Hood.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d Tim said, unwilling to believe it, \u201cNo, he didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI put a gun to the Joker\u2019s head,\u201d Jason drew a gun to demonstrate, his voice soft, \u201cAnd I told him that he could kill the Joker.\u00a0 Or he could kill me.\u00a0 And do you know what he did?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe gun was wavering very close to Tim.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo you know what he did, Replacement?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t kill the Joker,\u201d Tim said quietly.\u00a0 The gun came to a stop on Tim\u2019s head.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, baby bird, he attacked me instead,\u201d Jason said softly, \u201cAnd the Joker escaped, as he always does, and then you ended up exactly where I was\u2014the crowbar, the bomb, everything.\u00a0 And yet again, Batman failed to save the day.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTim swallowed.\u00a0 Cold, hard metal was pressing right above his ear.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t deserve a Robin,\u201d Jason said, his voice achingly hollow.\u00a0 His blue eyes were swimming with tears.\u00a0 \u201cHe never did.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Jason choked out, \u201cDon\u2019t you dare try to defend him.\u00a0 You\u2019re going to die here and your precious Batman will be too late again.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTim stared up at the boy he\u2019d always idolized, the boy whose suit he\u2019d tried so desperately to fill, the boy whose death had nearly torn Batman apart and this city with it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to kill me,\u201d Tim said softly.\n\u00a0\nJason\u2019s expression twisted, aiming for fury but staying at hurt.\u00a0 Teardrops were splattering on Tim\u2019s face.\u00a0 \u201cYou sure about that, Replacement?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes,\u201d Tim said, going limp.\u00a0 Putting all his faith into those wounded blue eyes.\u00a0 Because\u2014\u201cYou\u2019re Robin.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re Robin,\u201d Tim repeated, \u201cYou saved me.\u00a0 Batman can\u2019t be everywhere\u2014that\u2019s why he needs a Robin.\u00a0 You saved me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m holding a gun to your head, baby bird, I think you\u2019re getting ahead of yourself.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTim exhaled, and believed with all of a thirteen-year-old\u2019s unconscious arrogance.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re not going to hurt me,\u201d Tim repeated, \u201cYou\u2019re Robin.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2014\u201d Jason\u2019s face twisted, smoothing out into anger, \u201cAre a little shit.\u201d\u00a0 The gun thudded against the floor and Tim took the breath he didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d been holding.\n\u00a0\nJason was crying now, deep, shuddering sobs wracking his body and Tim could see his anguished face from where he was still curled over Tim.\u00a0 He swallowed, and stretched out a careful hand.\n\u00a0\nJason froze when Tim grasped his shoulder, and Tim didn\u2019t give him the time to react.\u00a0 He lunged, wrapped his arms around Jason and burying his head in the older boy\u2019s shoulder, hoping he wasn\u2019t going to get a startled knife in the gut or a surprised sucker punch.\n\u00a0\nJason was tense, his body thrumming, but slowly his arms crept around Tim and Tim squeezed tighter.\u00a0 Jason was alive.\u00a0 Robin was alive.\n\u00a0\nNothing else mattered.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t your replacement,\u201d the kid said around his cup of tea.\n\u00a0\nJason tensed.\u00a0 Of course the idiot had waited until Jason had joined him on the couch\u2014propping his broken legs up on a cushion in Jason\u2019s lap, and while Jason wasn\u2019t exactly trapped, he had to make the unsubtle attempt to extricate himself if he wanted to flee this conversation.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI think I remember the cape well enough,\u201d Jason said irritably, drinking his own tea.\u00a0 The kid seemed to be clinging to the mistaken impression that Jason wasn\u2019t going to shove him off.\u00a0 Or shoot him.\n\u00a0\nYou\u2019re Robin.\u00a0 Not a statement.\u00a0 Not recognition.\u00a0 Just deep, unshakeable faith.\n\u00a0\nJason could\u2019ve done it.\u00a0 Could\u2019ve finished the job he\u2019d planned, taken the shot, bang.\u00a0 The Replacement would be dead.\n\u00a0\nDead, looking up at Jason with wide, trusting, blank eyes.\u00a0 Dead, without ever realizing that his faith had been shattered.\u00a0 Dead.\n\u00a0\nAnd that had made something in Jason\u2019s heart clench.\n\u00a0\nYou\u2019re Robin.\u00a0 Robin didn\u2019t shoot innocent kids in the face.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI mean, he didn\u2019t replace you,\u201d the kid said, quieter, like he was aware he was treading on shaky ground, \u201cI\u2014I did.\u00a0 I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat do you mean, you did?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2014Batman was\u2026losing himself,\u201d the kid said softly.\u00a0 His shoulders were hunched as he rubbed the edge of the cup.\u00a0 \u201cHe was\u2014Jason, it was bad.\u00a0 He put nearly every criminal he met in the hospital.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJason scoffed.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t care about criminals.\u00a0 Batman should\u2019ve put them in the ground.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe was trying to kill himself.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJason choked on his next sip, spluttering at the matter-of-fact delivery.\u00a0 The kid looked haunted.\n\u00a0\nBatman hadn\u2019t\u2014wouldn\u2019t kill himself.\u00a0 Not over Jason.\u00a0 The kid didn\u2019t know what he was talking about.\u00a0 Batman hadn\u2019t even killed the Joker.\u00a0 Had attacked Jason instead of killing the Joker.\u00a0 Clearly, he didn\u2019t care.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI saw it and I tried to stop it,\u201d the kid said quietly, \u201cI tried to get Dick to come back, but he wouldn\u2019t.\u00a0 I tried to get Batman to take me on as Robin, and he wouldn\u2019t.\u00a0 So I made myself a suit and went out there anyway.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJason raised an eyebrow, reluctantly impressed.\u00a0 \u201cAnd B allowed that?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe couldn\u2019t stop me,\u201d the kid shrugged, \u201cSo he agreed to train me.\u201d\u00a0 The kid looked at him with round eyes.\u00a0 \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to take your place.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t know you were alive.\u00a0 I\u2019m sorry, Jason.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJason narrowed his eyes and looked away.\u00a0 \u201cAnd I suppose you forced him to adopt you too?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d the kid choked and Jason looked over to see red blotches rising on his cheeks.\u00a0 \u201cNo, he didn\u2019t adopt me!\u00a0 I didn\u2019t\u2014he didn\u2019t replace you, Jason, I swear.\u00a0 I\u2019m not\u2014my parents are alive, there was no adopting of any kind!\u201d\n\u00a0\nThat was\u2026not what Jason was expecting.\u00a0 \u201cYour parents are alive?\u201d Jason frowned, and checked the clock.\u00a0 It was coming up on twenty hours since Jason had found the kid.\u00a0 \u201cAren\u2019t they going to report you missing?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe kid smiled tightly.\u00a0 \u201cThey\u2019re on a trip.\u00a0 They won\u2019t know I\u2019m gone.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd they won\u2019t even notice?\u201d Jason\u2019s frown deepened.\u00a0 He was sure there was something wrong in that.\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t you have to check in or something?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, they trust me to stay safe.\u201d\u00a0 If the kid was running around as a vigilante, clearly that trust was misplaced.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo Bruce made you Robin without adopting you?\u201d Jason squinted.\u00a0 He hadn\u2019t known that that was a possibility.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really give him a choice,\u201d the kid said sheepishly, \u201cI figured out who he was ages ago.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJason squinted harder.\u00a0 The black eyes were throwing him off, but the features definitely looked familiar.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re that photo stalker,\u201d he said as the memory clicked.\u00a0 \u201cThe Drake kid!\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe kid looked deeply flustered by the description, sinking further into the cushions.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2014yes\u2014I\u2019m sorry about that,\u201d he stuttered, and Jason clearly remembered a few times when he had to rescue the kid off of some ridiculous perch with that stupidly expensive camera and\u2014\n\u00a0\nYou\u2019re Robin.\u00a0 Oh.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTim, right?\u201d Jason said, tilting his head to one side to observe him better.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t know a whole lot about the Drakes, other than that they lived next to Wayne Manor, because they were never in town.\n\u00a0\nClearly the baby bird had taken full advantage of the parental neglect.\n\u00a0\nJason, on his part, was merely surprised Bruce had been able to resist adopting this one.\u00a0 He looked like a ruffled little chick once he was out of uniform, with gangly limbs and round, wide blue eyes.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m Tim Drake,\u201d the kid set the empty tea cup aside and extended his hand, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJason shook his hand, bemused, before finally extricating himself from the couch and picking up the cups.\u00a0 Tim tracked him into the kitchen and watched with wary eyes as he headed for the bedroom.\u00a0 \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d he called out.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPatrol,\u201d Jason replied, clipped.\u00a0 He was shrugging into the leather jacket by the time the kid replied.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCan I call Bruce?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d Jason snarled immediately, grabbing his helmet and stalking out.\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t care what you say, this isn\u2019t a happy family reunion and I don\u2019t want to see him.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut,\u201d Tim started, and then bit his lip, watching Jason as he got ready to leave.\u00a0 Blinking slowly as he sunk back into the cushions, probably calculating all the different ways he could get a signal out after Jason left.\n\u00a0\nJason allowed himself a smile as he slid the helmet on.\n\u00a0\nThe color drained from Tim\u2019s face.\u00a0 \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d he whispered.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSleep tight, baby bird,\u201d Jason said, retrieving the blanket and tucking him in as the kid\u2019s blinks became longer and slower.\n\u00a0\nBy the time Jason locked the window behind him, the kid was out like a light.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJason\u2019s mood soured almost immediately.\u00a0 Sirens were out in full force.\u00a0 The Joker still hadn\u2019t been caught.\u00a0 And Batman was scouring the city like he had a beef with every brick.\n\u00a0\nAt least it gave him an opportunity to finally put a bullet in that fucking clown\u2019s head.\n\u00a0\nBut retracing the Joker\u2019s steps took a significant amount of patience and even more hiding as Jason ducked out of sight whenever he saw the hint of a cape.\u00a0 Batman wasn\u2019t going to stop him.\u00a0 Not today.\u00a0 He\u2019d gotten one Robin killed, and nearly got another as well.\u00a0 If Batman wasn\u2019t going to solve the problem, Jason would.\n\u00a0\nYou\u2019re Robin, Tim had said.\u00a0 Jason wasn\u2019t, but that was better.\u00a0 Robin didn\u2019t kill.\n\u00a0\nJason swung to the roof of the third warehouse he\u2019d tracked down, certain it would be as empty as the others, but having learned a painful lesson on leaping before he looked.\u00a0 He shimmied in through a skylight and froze at the sound of that damned laugh.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou play Whack-A-Mole at the circus, don\u2019t you?\u201d Joker asked, his voice echoing around the warehouse in funny ways.\n\u00a0\nFor a moment, he sounded like he was right next to Jason\u2014but his gun had nothing to aim at but shadows and Jason had to take a moment to remember how to breathe.\n\u00a0\n\u201cKeep hitting robins and they keep popping up!\u201d Joker sounded delighted, his words punctuated by the dull smack of metal on flesh.\n\u00a0\nA harder swing, and something cracked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow long will it take Batsy to replace you I wonder?\u201d the Joker cackled\u2014ha-ha-HA\u2014and Jason had to pause to cover his ears as the maniacal laughter reverberated in his skull.\u00a0 He needed to find a good vantage point.\u00a0 He needed to put a bullet in the fucker\u2019s skull.\u00a0 He needed it all to stop.\u00a0 \u201cThe original model!\u201d\n\u00a0\nJason froze.\n\u00a0\nThe sound of metal slicing through air and a dull thunk.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGive my regards to the other birds!\u201d\u00a0 The voice was fading, taking the laughter with it.\u00a0 \u201cLet me know how this one feels when you come back!\u201d\n\u00a0\nJason scrambled forward\u2014he was getting away, Jason wouldn\u2019t let him, he was\u2014\n\u00a0\nThe bomb looked bigger this time.\u00a0 Something chemical was wafting up from it.\u00a0 1:02 the timer proclaimed.\n\u00a0\nA twisted pile of blue and black lay underneath it.\n\u00a0\nJason fixed his eyes on the other door.\u00a0 Nightwing was going to be fine.\u00a0 How many times had Jason revisited that warehouse, how many times had he struggled against his bonds with the aching certainty that Dick was stronger, Dick was faster, Dick was better\u2014Dick would\u2019ve gotten himself out.\n\u00a0\nJason was going to find the Joker and end this mad game once and for all and\u2014\n\u00a0\nNightwing wasn\u2019t moving.\n\u00a0\nJason dropped down to the ground floor, wary, but black-and-blue was still and silent.\u00a0 Jason found a nearby scrap of metal and threw it at the lump.\n\u00a0\nNightwing didn\u2019t even twitch.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFuck.\u201d\n\u00a0\n0:34 the timer blinked.\n\u00a0\nJason grabbed Nightwing\u2014not gently, because he had no time to be gentle, and Dick was heavy where the kid had been light.\u00a0 The grapple almost groaned under their weight, but Jason made it to the roof and crossed to the next one as fast as he could, and then the one after that, and then\u2014\n\u00a0\nAn explosion, bright and intense and burning and Jason swore as he shoved Dick into a corner and curled up over him as best as he could.\u00a0 That had been ten seconds too early.\n\u00a0\nA piece of debris seared across his shoulder blades as it glanced off of him and Jason gritted his teeth as flames hissed and sparked nearby.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t lift his head until he heard the sirens.\n\u00a0\nFirst Jason.\u00a0 Then Tim.\u00a0 Now Dick.\n\u00a0\nJason scoured the hazy skyline, but saw no trace of a cape or cowl.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe hurt was a deep ache, deeper than his bones, and Dick couldn\u2019t help the soft gasp as he tried to shift.\u00a0 Everything hurt, everything throbbed, and even lying still wasn\u2019t enough to dull the sharp spikes.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDick?\u201d a soft voice asked carefully.\u00a0 Tim, Dick\u2019s mind supplied, the new Robin, and something about that spelled danger, there was something off, something he was missing.\u00a0 \u201cDick, it\u2019s okay, you\u2019re safe.\u201d\n\u00a0\nDick pushed weakly against the hand on his shoulder\u2014he wanted to believe Tim but there was something itching at him, something wrong\u2014the pain was clawing at him, dragging him back down and dulling the faint conversation happening over his head.\n\u00a0\nDick tried to crack his eyes open and caught a glimpse of broad shoulders and dark hair.\n\u00a0\nOh, he thought, slipping back under, if Bruce was here then everything was fine.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe drifted back to awareness like he was floating down a river\u2014the pain was dulled this time, he thought he could faintly remember swallowing some pills\u2014and the aches drifted back in with strong afternoon light and someone reading a book out loud.\n\u00a0\nIt was Tim, Dick recognized his voice, but for a moment his breath caught because Jason had been the one who snuck down and read his books aloud whenever Dick was laid up in the Cave and a part of him missed his brother so badly it hurt worse than all his wounds.\n\u00a0\nDick shifted, feeling the loss slice through him, and then his thoughts slipped into sudden clarity.\n\u00a0\nJason.\u00a0 The Joker.\u00a0 Tim was missing, a warehouse had exploded, bomb because there was always a bomb\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u201cTim!\u201d Dick gasped, twisting towards the kid\u2019s voice\u2014and Tim\u2019s face swam blurrily into view, his forehead creased.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d Tim patted his shoulder, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, we\u2019re safe.\u201d\n\u00a0\nDick wanted to relax, to slip back into the floating feeling because Tim said it was safe, and he trusted Tim, but.\n\u00a0\nBut the angle of the light was wrong.\n\u00a0\nThe wallpaper was peeling.\n\u00a0\nHe didn\u2019t recognize the scent of detergent on the sheets.\n\u00a0\nTim had two black eyes.\n\u00a0\nAnd there was a Red Hood helmet on the bedside table.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTim,\u201d Dick swallowed.\u00a0 He could tell that the mask was gone, that his uniform was gone, that his comms were gone.\u00a0 \u201cWhere are we?\u201d\n\u00a0\nTim\u2019s gaze flickered to the doorway.\u00a0 Dick didn\u2019t follow it.\u00a0 \u201cSomewhere in Crime Alley, I think,\u201d he said slowly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cA safehouse?\u201d Dick pressed, as if both of them didn\u2019t know full well that Batman\u2019s safehouses would never look like this.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDepends on your definition of safe,\u201d someone said in the doorway, low and rough.\n\u00a0\nDick acted.\u00a0 He managed to untangle the bedsheet and twist over to the bedside table\u2014ribs, wrenched elbow, ow, ow, ow\u2014and flung the helmet in Hood\u2019s direction, catching a brief glimpse of black hair and a scowl as he rolled\u2014his hip was throbbing painfully\u2014to the edge of the bed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDick\u2014Dick, stop, calm down\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe helmet clattered against the floor.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re worse than Tim,\u201d Hood said, aggrieved.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhere are we?\u201d Dick demanded, pushing himself up despite the screaming agony.\u00a0 His eyes were watering, the room washed out into a blur as the black-haired, broad-shouldered man stalked closer\u2014Dick could\u2019ve almost mistaken him for Bruce if not for that rough, scraped-gravel voice.\u00a0 \u201cWhy did you take us?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDick, please, he saved us\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid you want me to leave you with the Joker?\u201d Hood snarled, easily catching Dick\u2019s fist and pushing him back against the bed.\u00a0 Dick let him do it, slumped back down with the momentum and waited for the grip to loosen before snapping back up\u2014\n\u00a0\nA strangled cry tore itself from Dick\u2019s throat as broken fingers made contact with a hard jaw, but the man was stumbling back and Dick pressed the advantage, lunging forward, off the bed, and attempting to get an arm around Hood\u2019s throat\u2014\n\u00a0\nThe man twisted out of the hold and took another step back.\u00a0 Dick unbalanced and crashed hard.\n\u00a0\nThe pain whited out everything.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDick!\u00a0 Dick, can you hear me?\u00a0 Dick!\u201d\n\u00a0\nDick came back to the sound of his own ragged breathing.\u00a0 His throat was dry and his cheeks wet.\u00a0 His ribs were screaming at him the loudest, followed by a broken leg and a massive, ringing headache.\u00a0 He could see a pair of heavy duty boots two steps away, just barely out of reach.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDick.\u201d\u00a0 Tim, worried and frantic.\u00a0 \u201cCome on, are you okay, you\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s fine,\u201d Hood growled, \u201cStay on the bed.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cStay.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDick?\u201d\u00a0 Tim\u2019s voice was much closer, like he was hanging off of the bed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m going to shoot you,\u201d Hood threatened, low and menacing.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d Dick croaked out, stretching out his arm no matter how badly it hurt, \u201cNo, don\u2019t\u2014Tim\u2014please\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBaby bird is fine,\u201d Hood huffed, dropping into a crouch, \u201cNow are you going to try to punch me again, or can I get you back on the bed?\u201d\n\u00a0\nDick curled the fingers of his unbroken hand.\u00a0 \u201cWhy did you save me from the Joker?\u201d he asked.\u00a0 He could see Hood\u2019s hands draped over his knees and watched as they tightened into fists.\n\u00a0\nDick didn\u2019t understand.\u00a0 He thought the Red Hood was one of Joker\u2019s previous aliases.\u00a0 Why\u2014who would\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Dickiebird,\u201d said a voice that was too low and too rough and too dead to be saying those words.\u00a0 \u201cWhy do you think?\u201d\n\u00a0\nDick twisted, looking up at the man looming over Dick with a faint scowl.\n\u00a0\nThere was a streak of white shooting through dark hair.\n\u00a0\n\u201cJason?\u201d Dick asked, half of his mind torn in painful heartbreak, the other half screaming that this wasn\u2019t possible.\n\u00a0\nThe Joker.\u00a0 The bomb, or the broken bones, or the hit to the head.\u00a0 Dick was dreaming.\u00a0 Dick was hallucinating.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m dead, aren\u2019t I?\u201d Dick asked, staring up at his little brother.\n\u00a0\nJason looked at the ceiling like he was praying for patience.\u00a0 \u201cWhy is that everybody\u2019s first reaction?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cPossibly because you\u2019re supposed to be dead,\u201d Tim said, half-hanging off the bed. \u00a0\u201cProbably because we\u2019ve recently been in stressful, traumatic situations.\u00a0 Most definitely because you look\u2026murdery.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re not dead, Dickface,\u201d Jason scowled, reaching down to haul Dick back onto the bed.\u00a0 Dick hissed as the movement sent several flares of pain skittering up his limbs, but Jason arranged his legs to reduce the ache to a dull throb.\n\u00a0\n\u201cJason,\u201d Dick said, his brain still stuck on the thought.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re alive.\u201d\u00a0 Dick can\u2019t believe it.\u00a0 They buried Jason.\u00a0 Dick saw him.\u00a0 Saw what the explosion had done to his younger brother.\n\u00a0\nThey buried him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo the old man didn\u2019t tell you either,\u201d Jason said quietly as he stepped back.\n\u00a0\nDick blanked on that, because he had to have misheard, he didn\u2019t just\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u201cBruce knows?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d Jason said darkly, \u201cHe\u2019s known for a month.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat,\u201d Dick said flatly, unable to tear his gaze from Jason.\u00a0 This was his little brother.\u00a0 This was his little brother back from the dead.\n\u00a0\nThis was his little brother back from the dead and Bruce didn\u2019t tell him.\n\u00a0\nJason was older.\u00a0 Taller.\u00a0 The scowl that had looked vaguely amusing on a sixteen-year-old\u2019s face had turned into a threat.\u00a0 He looked\u2026angry.\n\u00a0\nAngry, like his family had abandoned him and left him for dead.\n\u00a0\n\u201cJay,\u201d Dick said, reaching a hand out because he still couldn\u2019t believe this and he needed to feel Jason\u2019s pulse with his own hand.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re alive.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou seem stuck on that point, Dickhead,\u201d Jason grumbled, but outstretched his hand far enough for Dick to snag his wrist.\n\u00a0\nIt was warm.\u00a0 He was alive.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMy baby brother is alive, damn right I\u2019m stuck on that point.\u201d\u00a0 Dick slowly pulled Jason closer, careful not to tug.\u00a0 Like Jason was an injured cat that would spook if he moved too fast.\n\u00a0\nDick bit back the smile at that mental image as Jason finally stepped next to the bed.\u00a0 \u201cWhat\u2014I don\u2019t even know where to start,\u201d Dick shook his head.\u00a0 He had so many questions.\u00a0 He was so very confused.\u00a0 And his brain was still stuck on Jason was alive.\u00a0 \u201cI thought we buried you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou did,\u201d Jason said.\n\u00a0\nDick felt like his blood turn to ice.\u00a0 \u201cWhat,\u201d he croaked out, followed by Tim\u2019s equally frantic, \u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI woke up in my coffin,\u201d Jason shrugged, as if it was no big deal that he\u2019d been buried alive.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou what.\u201d\u00a0 This was worse than everything Dick had imagined.\u00a0 This was\u2014how\u2014had Bruce not checked\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s what Talia told me, anyway,\u201d Jason said.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTalia?\u201d Dick repeated.\u00a0 He was finding it difficult to breathe.\u00a0 \u201cTalia al Ghul?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou know someone else named Talia?\u201d Jason scowled.\u00a0 He tugged at Dick\u2019s grip, like he was going to step away, but the thing about wrangling little injured kittens was to get them close enough before you attacked.\n\u00a0\nDick lunged\u2014this time the hold was gentler, wrapping around Jason\u2019s shoulders rather than going for his throat, and he really hoped Jason didn\u2019t attack him because his broken ribs were already screaming.\n\u00a0\nBut Jason didn\u2019t move.\u00a0 He stayed as still as a statue as Dick hugged him\u2014Dick wasn\u2019t even sure he was still breathing\u2014for a long, stretching moment before Dick felt hands carefully wrap around his back.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe League of Assassins?\u201d Dick choked out, feeling his brother\u2019s heartbeat pounding, reassuring him that he was here and alive and here.\u00a0 \u201cYou were taken by the League?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThere was a muffled sound Dick took as agreement.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe Pit?\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnother mumbled agreement.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow long?\u201d Dick\u2019s voice cracked, because he didn\u2019t want to consider it, didn\u2019t want to know how many times he\u2019d failed his little brother, how many nights he slept in his bed, safe and warm, without a thought to Jason who\u2019d still been alive\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u201cA couple of years,\u201d Jason said quietly.\u00a0 Dick\u2019s grip tightened.\n\u00a0\nYears.\u00a0 Years his brother had been alive and Dick had never even noticed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCame back to Gotham a month or so ago,\u201d Jason said, and his voice dropped.\u00a0 \u201cI thought\u2014the Joker.\u00a0 Batman.\u00a0 I thought\u2014well, I was wrong anyway, so it doesn\u2019t matter what I thought.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBatman had met the Red Hood.\u00a0 Dick had asked him for his impression, but Bruce had snapped at him and Dick had left because he hadn\u2019t thought it important enough.\n\u00a0\nDick was well on his way to win Worst Brother of the Decade.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt matters,\u201d Dick said softly, \u201cIt matters to me.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJason didn\u2019t say anything, but he tightened his grip.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here, Little Wing,\u201d Dick said softly.\u00a0 I\u2019m glad you\u2019re alive.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe trouble started after dinner.\u00a0 Jason didn\u2019t drug the tea this time, mainly because he thought Dick would be the reasonable one\u2014mistake number one\u2014and Tim was watching him like a hawk and refusing to touch anything until Jason had sampled it first.\u00a0 But neither of them were in any condition to leave, and Dick hadn\u2019t even mentioned contacting Bruce, so Jason stacked some supplies for easy access on the bedside table, ignored their curious looks\u2014mistake number two\u2014and got ready to leave.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Dick asked, his eyes narrowing with every piece of gear Jason strapped on.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPatrol,\u201d Jason responded simply.\u00a0 It was the truth.\u00a0 If he failed to mention that the patrol was less geographically based and more focused on a certain clown-faced asshole, well, that wasn\u2019t really a lie.\n\u00a0\nHis third mistake was thinking that Dick would let it drop.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d Dick said, flat.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou can\u2019t stop me,\u201d Jason said, not at all trying to be pleasant.\u00a0 Dick didn\u2019t get to dictate Jason\u2019s life\u2014not back when he\u2019d been Robin, when Dick had considered him little more than an intruder\u2014and definitely not now.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going on patrol,\u201d Dick said and Jason bristled.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re going after the Joker.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLess an order and more an observation, then.\u00a0 Jason shrugged as he checked his holsters, not meeting Dick\u2019s gaze.\u00a0 \u201cSomeone has to put the fucker down,\u201d he said.\n\u00a0\nHis body was tense.\u00a0 If Dick even tried to defend the clown, Jason was going to\u2014Jason was\u2014Jason was going to leave.\n\u00a0\n\u201cJay,\u201d Dick said.\n\u00a0\nJason paused before pulling on his helmet and looked up.\n\nThe kid had the sense to bury his head in one of Jason\u2019s books and pretend like he wasn\u2019t paying attention to the conversation.\u00a0 Dick was staring at him, his hands twisting in the sheets\u2014Jason inwardly winced as broken fingers curled.\n\u00a0\nAnd, as Jason watched, Dick\u2019s expression cracked.\u00a0 Jason froze.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t go.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSorry, Dick,\u201d Jason shrugged, \u201cGotham calls.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cJason.\u00a0 Don\u2019t.\u00a0 Not after him.\u00a0 Please.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to tell me he doesn\u2019t deserve it\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo!\u00a0 God, Jay, of course he deserves it!\u00a0 But he killed you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis time, I have a gun,\u201d Jason pointed out.\u00a0 Tim was peering over the edge of the book, watching them with wide eyes.\u00a0 \u201cI have many guns.\u00a0 And I know how to use them.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJason watched, tracking for any hint of disgust on Dick\u2019s face, any sign of displeasure, any mention of that fucking \u2018no-killing\u2019 rule.\n\u00a0\nInstead, he saw Dick\u2019s face crumple completely.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d his big brother gasped out and Jason automatically took two steps closer\u2014Tim\u2019s eyes went wide but he wasn\u2019t moving and Jason was not qualified to deal with a panic attack.\u00a0 \u201cPlease, Jay, this is\u2014it\u2019s a dream and if you leave\u2014I don\u2019t\u2014I can\u2019t wake up to see you gone, Jay, please\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cCalm down, Dick,\u201d Jason said harshly, reaching out to help Dick track his breaths and stop hyperventilating.\u00a0 Dick seized his wrist like a drowning man and Jason leaned over, making sure he wasn\u2019t choking from a deflated lung.\n\u00a0\nIn retrospect, he shouldn\u2019t have taken his eyes off the baby bird.\n\u00a0\nDick\u2019s grip tightened, and shifted\u2014he went for a stranglehold and Jason tipped rather than break the hold and Dick\u2019s arm with it, but determined hands grabbed the edge of his jacket and tugged him down.\n\u00a0\nJason fell onto the bed, mostly bewildered.\u00a0 Dick was trapping one of his arms and Tim was sprawled along his back.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLogically, this was an attack, but Jason was a bit too confused to categorize it as such.\u00a0 \u201cI, uh.\u00a0 What are you guys doing?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou can\u2019t go,\u201d Tim said to his shoulder blades, like his hundred pounds soaking wet was going to stop Jason from anything.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not watching you die,\u201d Dick said, hoarse.\u00a0 Tears were dripping slowly from his eyes.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m not burying you again.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis time probably leave me with a cellphone so I don\u2019t have to crawl my way out,\u201d Jason snarked and then swallowed as the tears turned into sobs.\n\u00a0\n\u201cJay.\u201d\u00a0 Dick\u2019s voice was what broke him.\u00a0 Pleading, desperate, terrified.\n\u00a0\nJason took a deep breath and held it.\u00a0 He wanted\u2014he needed to put a bullet in the Joker\u2019s skull.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t, Jaybird,\u201d Dick choked out, \u201cI can\u2019t lose you.\u00a0 I just got you back.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBut the only people Jason cared about protecting were right here.\u00a0 The Joker would keep.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJason carefully wiped the excess oil off with a rag as he wiped down every individual piece of the gun, all laid out on the large towel on the bed.\u00a0 He was careful to sit still, moving only his arms\u2014Tim had curled his fingers through the loops in Jason\u2019s jeans and Dick had an arm slung around his waist as he pressed his face into the pillow.\u00a0 Both of them were still and silent, but Jason didn\u2019t trust them to stay that way if he moved.\n\u00a0\nThey needed the sleep.\u00a0 Jason needed to do something with his hands if he couldn\u2019t pull a trigger, and cleaning his guns was a slow, methodical task.\n\u00a0\nSomething scratched at the window in the other room.\u00a0 Jason stilled his movements, and it felt like the whole room was holding its breath.\n\u00a0\nMore scratching.\u00a0 The click of the lock.\u00a0 A long pause\u2014more than enough time to dismantle the rudimentary shock wire connected to the window.\n\u00a0\nThere were no footsteps, but Jason could feel a familiar prickle on the back of his neck as he put the rag down.\n\u00a0\nHe picked up the other gun and levelled it straight at the intruder.\n\u00a0\nBatman was looming in the doorway.\u00a0 He was a still and silent shadow\u2014his head didn\u2019t turn, but Jason knew he was scanning the room, observing as Tim\u2019s chest rose and fell, scrutinizing the contorted position Dick somehow found comfortable, cataloguing their injuries.\n\u00a0\nWatching Jason, and the loaded gun aimed at his head.\n\u00a0\n\u201cJoker\u2019s in Arkham,\u201d Batman offered, like it was supposed to be a comfort.\n\u00a0\nJason didn\u2019t even bother to scoff.\u00a0 His finger curled around the trigger.\u00a0 \u201cShall we take bets on who he comes after next?\u00a0 Or how about which one of us will manage to stay dead?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBatman was silent for a long time.\u00a0 \u201cHow are they?\u201d he asked finally.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSleeping,\u201d Jason growled.\u00a0 Batman shifted, like he was intending to come inside, and Jason\u2019s hand tightened on the gun.\u00a0 Batman wisely decided not to push his luck.\u00a0 \u201cTurns out being tortured and nearly blown up is exhausting work.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBatman regarded him for a long moment.\u00a0 \u201cHow are you?\u201d he asked, his voice softer, more Bruce than Batman.\n\u00a0\nJason was tempted to shoot him on principle.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get to ask that question,\u201d he snarled instead, rough and low.\n\u00a0\nBecause he was back in that warehouse, hearing his bones snap, wishing desperately for his father to come save him until the timer ran down and everything became fire and\u2014and Batman hadn\u2019t saved him.\n\u00a0\nAnd Jason had to live with that.\n\u00a0\nBatman didn\u2019t press and didn\u2019t move.\u00a0 The silence stretched and Jason clenched his hand into a fist before clicking the safety back on and dropping the gun.\n\u00a0\nHe got back to cleaning, wiping down the next piece and trying not to let his fingers tremble.\u00a0 \u201cWhen did you know?\u201d he asked, quietly, dispassionately.\u00a0 He flicked a glance up at the shadowed cowl.\u00a0 \u201cWhen did you figure out they were here?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cLast night,\u201d Batman answered easily.\u00a0 \u201cOracle picked you and Tim up on a security camera.\u00a0 I was going to check in when\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\nSo that was where Batman had been when the warehouse had blown up.\u00a0 Jason scowled at the rag, at the faint sense of \u2018your fault\u2019 he could feel, and waited for the lecture.\u00a0 For taking Tim and Dick.\u00a0 For not checking in.\u00a0 For letting Batman run around the city believing they were missing while there were criminals to catch.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd you just left them here?\u201d Jason sneered.\n\u00a0\nBatman shifted.\u00a0 His voice was weary when he replied.\u00a0 Weary and sad.\u00a0 \u201cThey\u2019re safe here.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJason couldn\u2019t help the growl.\n\u00a0\nHe could almost imagine the raised eyebrow.\u00a0 He wanted to refute the point, preferably by lunging at Batman\u2019s stupid face, but then he\u2019d wake them up.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Batman offered, like it was supposed to mean something.\u00a0 Like it even mattered in the face of Joker\u2019s continued survival.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFor what?\u201d Jason replied, tired.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Batman repeated instead of answering the question, and slunk out because he apparently got hives from any form of straightforward communication.\n\u00a0\nJason made a face, used all of his considerable self-control to resist shooting him in the back, and aggressively put his gun back together as he waited for the window to close again.\n\u00a0\nIt closed, but the prickling sensation didn\u2019t fade.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know you\u2019re still out there,\u201d Jason muttered irritably.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLurking is not a replacement for talking about your feelings, Bruce!\u201d Dick snarled, curling his hand into Jason\u2019s hoodie before he subsided into disgruntled grumbling.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t ask to go back to the Manor,\u201d Jason hummed, leaning back against the headboard.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI think it would be better if B and I weren\u2019t in the same house at the moment,\u201d Dick said darkly.\u00a0 There was a long pause.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re alive.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI believe we established that, yes.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, Jay, I mean\u2014is there paperwork to come back from the dead?\u201d Dick was frowning now.\u00a0 \u201cWe probably have to talk to some W.E. lawyers to look into bringing you back legally.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019d rather not come back as Jason Todd-Wayne,\u201d Jason said softly to all listening ears, \u201cHaven\u2019t had the best run with fathers.\u201d\n\u00a0\nDick\u2019s grip tightened.\u00a0 There was no sound from the window.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI could adopt you!\u201d Dick chirped, but when Jason twisted to look down at him, his expression was dead serious.\u00a0 \u201cJason Grayson.\u00a0 I like it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m an adult, I don\u2019t need to be adopted, and I\u2019m perfectly fine without legal paperwork.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut who will teach you how to do taxes?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou seem to be operating under the mistaken assumption that I intend to be a lawful citizen.\u201d\u00a0 A pause.\u00a0 \u201cDo you even do your own taxes?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cCome oooon, Jay.\u00a0 Your new name rhymes and everything!\u00a0 I promise I won\u2019t set a bedtime.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou know that I can still shoot you, right?\u00a0 That it\u2019s still on the table?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cJay Gray.\u00a0 Gray Jay?\u00a0 Ooh, your new name could be the Grayjay!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat the fuck is that supposed to be.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBetter than the Red Hood, certainly.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cShut up and go to sleep, Dickface.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot until you agree to be adopted!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cJay.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cPlease.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, and you\u2019re going to wake up Tim.\u201d\u00a0 Tim cracked his eyes open and grinned.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPretty, pretty please with strawberries and cranberries and sprinkles and choco chips and raspberry syrup and walnuts and\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\nJason slumped back and groaned, \u201cFucking hell.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201c\u2014And cookie crumbs and whipped cream and vanilla bean and hazelnuts and blueberries and caramel syrup and\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOn one condition.\u201d\n\u00a0\nDick narrowed his eyes.\u00a0 Tim looked anxious, like he thought Jason was going to ask for the Joker\u2019s head on a platter.\u00a0 Dick, who knew him better, looked wary, like he thought Jason was going to ask for a horse.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou adopt the baby bird too.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThere was loud squawking from the other side of the bed.\u00a0 \u201cDeal,\u201d Dick grinned.\u00a0 Jason smiled, and ignored the shadow outside the window.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0"
