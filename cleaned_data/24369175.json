    "text": "On an otherwise unremarkable long weekend in the middle of term, Lan Wangji takes the train home to Cloud Recesses. He normally wouldn\u2019t make the trip for such a short stay, but his uncle has asked to see him, and as Lan Qiren is neither frivolous nor sentimental, Lan Wangji assumes that he has a good reason for wanting to speak in person. He isn\u2019t overly anxious about what might necessitate such a serious conversation \u2013 his studies, now as in his undergraduate career, are progressing smoothly, and neither he nor his small circle of friends have done anything remotely gossipworthy of late \u2013 and so assumes it\u2019s either regarding his brother\u2019s upcoming birthday or some matter of clan politics too delicate for a regular phonecall.\nIn a sense, he turns out to be right.\n\u201cWangji,\u201d says Lan Qiren, once they\u2019re kneeling comfortably at a low table and two cups of tea have been poured. \u201cLet me speak plainly. In this modern world, the clans and cultivation sects play a different role than once they did, but the bonds between us are just as important as ever.\u201d\n\u201cMn.\u201d\n\u201cThese bonds can be strengthened in many ways, but one of the most venerable is through marriage and the creation of blood-ties.\u201d\nWarning bells start to ring in Lan Wangji\u2019s head.\n\u201cFor too long,\u201d Lan Qiren continues, oblivious, \u201cthe Lan have failed to make marital connections with the other sects. We have been isolated, and this must not continue. I have thought deeply on this matter, and after consulting with Jin Guangshan, acting in his capacity as head of the LanlingJin, and having made the proper consultations with her family, we have decided that you would be an excellent match for one of his best disciples, Luo Qingyang.\u201d\nLan Wangji, who up until this point has only ever met his uncle\u2019s requests with demure acceptance or a polite request for more information, jerks like a heavy fish on a too-thin line and says, \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cLuo Qingyang,\u201d says Lan Qiren, a frown appearing between his eyebrows. \u201cWe would like you to marry her.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d And then, because he can see his uncle is about to repeat his explanation about strengthening ties with the LanlingJin, \u201cI mean, why me?\u201d\n\u201cAh.\u201d Lan Qiren smiles faintly. \u201cYou mean, why not your elder brother?\u201d\nNo, thinks Wan Wangji wildly, I mean, why any of this at all? But he forces himself to nod, drymouthed.\n\u201cTwo reasons,\u201d says Lan Qiren, raising a hand to tick them off on his fingers. \u201cFirstly, because I hope to find a more illustrious match for Xichen, who after all is heir to both the Lan Clan and the GusuLan Sect. I mean no slight to Luo Qingyang, of course \u2013 she is both an accomplished cultivator and a suitably modest young woman \u2013 but the Luo are not one of the major clans, and I have hopes that Xichen might net us a different sort of alliance. And secondly, because you and Miss Luo already know and like one other. You were classmates at school, you have friends in common, and that sort of connection is a sturdy basis for marital harmony.\u201d\nLan Wangji resists the childish urge to close his eyes in the vain hope that this will somehow make the conversation stop happening. True, he\u2019s on good terms with Luo Qingyang, better known to her friends as Mianmian, but that\u2019s more due to their shared friendship with Jin Zixuan than because of any innate compatibility, and as for the rest of it \u2013 \u00a0\n\u201cUncle. With the greatest respect, why do we need to strengthen ties with the Jin in this manner? I understand the importance of alliances, but surely \u2013\u201d\nHe breaks off, distracted by the sudden mad buzzing of his phone in response to an incoming volley of texts. Very few people ever text Lan Wangji, let alone with such persistence, and he has an awful premonition that his uncle\u2019s plans are no longer secret. Is Mianmian, too, being subjected to such an awful conversation even now, or is she yet to have it sprung on her? She can\u2019t have known; they aren\u2019t close, but he knows her well enough to be certain that she wouldn\u2019t let him be blindsided by something like this.\n\u201cSurely what?\u201d prompts Lan Qiren, frowning at Lan Wangji\u2019s silence.\n\u201cSurely there\u2019s a better way to ally our sects, in this day and age. Shared indoctrinations, perhaps, or disciple exchanges \u2013\u201d\n\u201cWangji,\u201d says Lan Qiren, sternly. \u201cSpeak to me plainly. What is your real objection?\u201d\nLan Wangji takes a steadying breath. \u201cI do not wish to be married. Not like this, and certainly not to Mianmian. I esteem her as much as I esteem anyone, but such a union would render us both miserable. It will not work. It cannot.\u201d He meets his uncle\u2019s furious gaze. \u201cI politely decline the match.\u201d\nFace like a thundercloud, Lan Qiren snaps, \u201cAnd on what basis, pray, do you claim that such an advantageous marriage is unworkable?\u201d\n\u201cUncle,\u201d says Lan Wangji, hands fisted to keep from trembling, \u201cI\u2019m gay.\u201d\nLan Qiren turns first red, then purple.\nAnd then he starts to yell.\nHis tirade is about piety, about moral upheaval, about sexual deviance and right behaviour and the importance of blood-ties to lineage, but Lan Wangji, for the first time in his life, remains immovable before his uncle\u2019s will. Stonefaced, he buries his hurt, his rage, and says only, \u201cRespectfully, I still decline. I will not marry her,\u201d until finally Lan Qiren runs out of invective and rasps at him to leave.\nLan Wangji exits his uncle\u2019s study at a controlled, measured pace. He walks to his childhood room, repacks the bag he brought with him, collects his sword, Bichen, and flies himself down the mountain to the train station in Caiyi Town. He buys a ticket, relieved beyond measure to find that the next train is just a few minutes away, and only once he is safely seated inside, his carriage gliding smoothly away from Cloud Recesses, does he take a shaky breath and pull out his phone.\nJin Zixuan: oh fuck I\u2019m so sorry\nJin Zixuan: please don\u2019t kill me this isn\u2019t my fault I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS I SWEAR I ONLY JUST FOUND OUT\nJin Zixuan: LITERALLY I JUST GOT HOME AND MY MOM WAS LIKE \u201cGREAT NEWS! YOUR SECT-SISTER IS GOING TO MARRY YOUR BEST FRIEND!\u201d AND SHE DIDN\u2019T EVEN BLINK\nJin Zixuan: MIANMIAN IS SEEING HER PARENTS RIGHT NOW, PRAY 4 HER\nJin Zixuan: WHY MUST WE LIVE IN THE DARKEST TIMELINE\nJin Zixuan: PLEASE TELL ME YOU\u2019RE NOT DOING THIS WANGJI I SWEAR TO GOD\nJin Zixuan: IM NOT TAKING OFF CAPSLOCK UNTIL YOU TELL ME YOU AREN\u2019T DOING THIS\nJin Zixuan: LOVE YOURSELF WANGJI PLS I BEG\nJin Zixuan: IF YOU DO THIS THEY\u2019LL THINK THEY CAN MARRY OFF THE REST OF US TOO AND I WILL NOT STAND FOR IT\nJin Zixuan: HELP ME WANGJI-LAN KENOBI YOU\u2019RE MY ONLY HOPE\nUnder ordinary circumstances, Lan Wangji isn\u2019t a fan of phone conversations, but this is very much the opposite of an ordinary anything. He phones Jin Zixuan, who mercifully picks up on the second ring, and says, without preamble, \u201cI\u2019m not doing it. Uncle is furious.\u201d\n\u201cOh thank fuck,\u201d says Jin Zixuan. Lan Wangji can hear him drinking from a bottle, and for once does not begrudge him the coping mechanism. \u201cWhat did you tell him? What did you say?\u201d\nLan Wangji shuts his eyes. \u201cI told him that I\u2019m gay.\u201d\nJin Zixuan lets out a shocked burst of laughter. \u201cHoly shit, you what? Like, I understand panicking in the heat of the moment, but you do realise that excuse isn\u2019t going to wash the second you bring home a girl for real, right?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an excuse,\u201d says Lan Wangji. Dimly, he\u2019s aware that he\u2019s shaking, and grips his phone case far too hard by way of compensation. \u201cI\u2019m. I really am gay.\u201d\nOne beat of silence. Two. Three. Then \u2013\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d says Jin Zixuan. \u201cYou\u2019re serious? You \u2013 really?\u201d\n\u201cReally.\u201d\n\u201cFuck.\u201d And then, with feeling, \u201cFuck, I didn\u2019t mean it like that, I just \u2013 I\u2019m surprised, but also supportive, and also, like, proud of you? Is that a thing? But also really pissed on your behalf, because I can\u2019t imagine that telling your uncle was easy, or that he took it well.\u201d\nLan Wangji leans his head on the window, the thick glass cool against his temple. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cFuck.\u201d\n\u201cMn.\u201d\nThey share a moment of silence. Jin Zixuan takes another swig of whatever he\u2019s drinking and then says, more hesitantly, \u201cDid other people know? About you liking men, I mean \u2013 not that you, like, owed it to me to come out before this or anything, but if I ever did anything to make you think I\u2019d be a dick about it, then \u2013\u201d\n\u201cNobody knew,\u201d says Lan Wangji quietly. And then, because there\u2019s no point hiding it anymore, \u201cOr at least, nobody who actually knows me knew. I have had\u2026 partners, at times, but no real relationships.\u201d\n\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d says Jin Zixuan, scandalized and delighted. \u201cAre you telling me you\u2019ve been indulging in casual hookups?\u201d\n\u201cSexual needs are nothing to be ashamed of,\u201d Lan Wangji says primly, and tries to pretend that his ears aren\u2019t burning. \u201cI knew that Uncle wouldn\u2019t accept me, so it didn\u2019t feel right, to try and date while I was closeted.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d\n\u201cMn.\u201d\n\u201cI fucking hate this, Wangji.\u201d\n\u201cMe, too.\u201d\n\u201cWait, hang on \u2013 where\u2019s your brother in all of this? What did he say?\u201d\nWith a lurch, Lan Wangji realizes he didn\u2019t even think to tell Xichen he was leaving Cloud Recesses. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he says, stomach churning. \u201cUncle threw me out of his office and I just \u2013 left.\u201d\n\u201cYou should talk to him,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s always been cool about stuff, he\u2019ll have your back \u2013 oh, fuck, hang on.\u201d There\u2019s a burst of scratchy static as the phone is presumably pressed against Jin Zixuan\u2019s chest, but the muffled sound of distant shouting and a door being slammed still comes through. There\u2019s a moment\u2019s silence, and then Jin Zixuan speaks again. \u201cWell, I\u2019m guessing Mianmian reacted about as well as you did. My dad is pissed. I\u2019m gonna call her, make sure she\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\u201cPlease do,\u201d says Lan Wangji. \u201cGive her my number, too, if she wants it \u2013 if we\u2019re both against this, we ought to fight it together.\u201d\n\u201cWill do. See you on Tuesday, all right?\u201d\n\u201cTuesday,\u201d Lan Wangji promises, and ends the call.\nHe zones out then, mind blanking on the fact that he just defied his uncle, refused a marriage and came out to, for all intents and purposes, the entire cultivation world in the space of a single argument. There\u2019s a hum of anxiety low in his gut, but mostly he feels a strange, detached sort of serenity: the worst has happened, and Lan Wangji has survived it.\nWhen his phone rings again, he\u2019s both relieved and unsurprised to see that it\u2019s Xichen calling.\n\u201cBrother,\u201d he says, voice scratchy with relief. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry \u2013\u201d\n\u201cYou have nothing to apologise for,\u201d says Lan Xichen. He\u2019s not a man much given to temper, but Lan Wangji can hear the telltale heat that means he\u2019s truly angry. \u201cI can\u2019t believe Uncle would spring this on you \u2013 demand this of you, with no preamble \u2013\u201d\n\u201cHe said he wants you to marry, too.\u201d\nXichen swears softly. \u201cDoes he not see the irony in a man who\u2019s stayed single his entire life insisting on marriage for others?\u201d\n\u201cApparently not.\u201d\n\u201cWangji,\u201d asks Xichen, softly. \u201cYou\u2019re gay?\u201d\nSwallowing, Lan Wangji nods, then realizes his brother can\u2019t see him. \u201cYou overheard?\u201d\n\u201cI think half of Cloud Recesses did. Uncle was\u2026 not discreet.\u201d\nLan Wangji winces, shutting his eyes. The train sways beneath him, and he lets himself pretend its motion alone is responsible for the way his stomach swoops. \u201cHow bad is it?\u201d\n\u201cTruly, not as bad as whatever you\u2019re thinking. Nobody who matters is against you.\u201d\nLan Wangji makes a small, relieved noise, and on the other end of the line, he hears Xichen sigh.\n\u201cWangji, I have to go. Uncle is looking for me.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t let him bully you,\u201d Lan Wangji says, and is rewarded by Xichen\u2019s laughter.\n\u201cI won\u2019t. Travel safely, brother.\u201d\n\u201cYou, too.\u201d\nLan Wangji hangs up, phone cradled in his hands. He feels emptied out, unable to quite accept how he reached this point despite the clear chain of events. What was Uncle thinking? He doesn\u2019t know, and isn\u2019t sure he wants to.\nSo he turns off his phone, tucks Bichen securely between his thigh and the carriage wall, and spends the rest of the ride back home in silence.\nFour days after the fateful conversation with his uncle, Lan Wangji is frowning at the tutorial homework his undergraduates turned in that morning for their History of Cultivation class, wondering if his own standards are simply too high or if this particular group of students is struggling with the material, when Jin Zixuan bursts into his office.\n\u201cWe have a problem,\u201d he says, by way of greeting.\nA chill born of long experience runs down Lan Wangji\u2019s spine. \u201cWhat sort of problem?\u201d\n\u201cApparently, our families aren\u2019t done meddling, and now they\u2019re dragging me into it, too.\u201d\nLan Wangji blinks at the screen, then swivels in his chair. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou heard me.\u201d\n\u201cExplain.\u201d\nShutting the office door, Jin Zixuan helps himself to the visitor\u2019s chair and fixes Lan Wangji with a look of feverish unease. \u201cWell. First off, after I got off the phone with you and Mianmian on Saturday, I figured there had to be a reason why our families are suddenly hell-bent on marrying us off, so I started doing some research. And on my side of things \u2013\u201d he grimaces, mouth pinching sourly, \u201c\u2013 apparently Mianmian\u2019s parents discovered that I have yet another half-sibling, and when they asked my father about it, he decided the best way to keep them quiet was to promise a good marriage for their daughter \u2013\u201d\n\u201cAnother half-sibling?\u201d Lan Wangji interrupts, startled.\n\u201cOh, yeah. A sister, this time. Qin Su.\u201d Jin Zixuan looks briefly wretched about it, and if Lan Wangji was any good at normal human interactions, this would probably be the moment to pat his shoulder or take his hand in comfort. Instead, he makes what he hopes is a conciliatory noise, and is relieved when Jin Zixuan\u2019s lips quirk in an almost-smile. \u201cIt\u2019s not her fault our dad is the worst. She knows, at least, which is a small mercy; I don\u2019t ever want a repeat of that conversation I had with Mo Xuanyu. I\u2019m going to go see her this weekend, compare notes, the usual.\u201d He shakes his head, gaze sharpening once more. \u201cAnyway. Apparently, my father was so persuasive about the matter that the Luos didn\u2019t really question it. He told them he knew enough about Mianmian to be sure she\u2019d accept the offer, which was a blatant lie, so they were completely blindsided when she didn\u2019t react positively to the news, and now he\u2019s trying to backtrack by implying that the reason she said no is because she and I are secretly an item.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cWhich means,\u201d says Jin Zixuan, through gritted teeth, \u201cthat I am now being pressured to marry Mianmian \u2013 or at the very least, to date her publicly for a while, to salve my father\u2019s pride \u2013 because if the Luos end up unsatisfied, then they might just let other people know how, once upon a time, he forced himself on the wife of an underling and got her pregnant. You know. Very normal stuff.\u201d\nLan Wangji inhales sharply. \u201cWhen you say he forced himself \u2013\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d says Jin Zixuan, short and furious. \u201cHe belongs in jail, and instead he\u2019s sat at home telling me how immoral and unfilial I am for refusing to help him fix a mess entirely of his own making.\u201d\nLan Wangji feels sick. \u201cDid my uncle know any of this?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d says Jin Zixuan, and Lan Wangji feels briefly relieved. \u201cStill, there\u2019s a reason why my father approached Lan Qiren first, instead of Nie Mingjue or Jiang Fengmian or Wen Ruohan. Apparently, your uncle has been writing letters to the other sect and clan heads about reviving classical cultivation etiquette for a while now \u2013 full adherence to the ancient rules, arranged marriages, rejection of modern technology while within cultivation schools, the lot.\u201d He snorts. \u201cMy best guess is, he\u2019s realized you and your brother aren\u2019t going to keep up his teaching methods once he\u2019s gone, so he\u2019s trying to get our whole generation under his thumb while he still has the chance.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2026 sounds very plausible,\u201d Lan Wangji admits, heart sinking. He\u2019s always known his uncle for a traditionalist, and has suspected for some time that the tragic deaths of his own parents, who\u2019d been so much more accepting of the modern world, had only entrenched this attitude. Even so, he\u2019d never thought it would go as far as trying to arrange marriages for both himself and Xichen.\n\u201cWhat does Mianmian think of all this?\u201d he asks.\nJin Zixuan grimaces. \u201cShe\u2019s about as furious as you\u2019d expect. When she found out about Qin Su, she wanted to go public immediately, but her parents have begged her not to; they keep saying it was so long ago, Jin Guangshan made an error, he\u2019s an honourable man who doesn\u2019t deserve to have his reputation ruined, they only wanted him to know that he had a daughter, not to try and press for any advantage \u2013 all the usual excuses. Plus, they know that she and I spend time together, so they also refuse to believe we aren\u2019t a couple. The idea that Jin Guangshan of the illustrious LanlingJin would barefacedly lie about his own son is apparently vastly less plausible than Mianmian being discreetly embarrassed about a secret boyfriend.\u201d He bares his teeth. \u201cSo now she\u2019s stuck between wanting my dad to get what\u2019s coming to him and having a good relationship with her family, which means she\u2019s actually considering the fake-dating idea.\u201d He rubs his face. \u201cI\u2019ve told her, if she decides she wants to go that route, I\u2019ll back her up, but neither of us is exactly happy about it. What about you \u2013 has your uncle been back in contact?\u201d\nLan Wangji\u2019s lip curls of its own accord. \u201cHe has written to me. Evidently, Xichen calmed him down enough to accept the fact that I am, indeed, homosexual, and that marrying a woman will not magically change this. As such, he has also decided that my having biological children would be a bad idea, as they might inherit my unfortunate condition.\u201d He grips the edge of his chair hard, feeling the plastic bite into his palms. \u201cHis new plan is that I swear myself to celibacy and dedicate my life to teaching new Lan disciples, the better to renew his faith in my filial piety.\u201d\n\u201cThis is bullshit,\u201d Jin Zixuan says.\n\u201cAgreed.\u201d\n\u201cAbsolute bullshit!\u201d\n\u201cMn.\u201d\nJin Zixuan opens his mouth, then closes it again. A terrible gleam comes into his eye. \u201cTherefore,\u201d he says, \u201cwe are going to take a stand against it. A public stand.\u201d\nOh no, says the rational part of Lan Wangji\u2019s brain. \u201cI\u2019m listening,\u201d says his mouth.\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Jin Zixuan leans forward, elbows braced on his knees, chin resting on his fists. \u201cYour brother\u2019s birthday is coming up, right? Big party at Cloud Recesses, all cultivators invited. And Zewu-Jun has control of the guest list, correct?\u201d\n\u201cHe does,\u201d says Lan Wangji, not quite liking where this is going.\n\u201cPerfect. So, here\u2019s the plan: I bring Qin Su, Mo Xuanyu and Meng Yao as my guests, to show my father I\u2019m willing to acknowledge them all even if he won\u2019t. Mianmain brings a partner of her choosing to kiss in public, to show her parents that she and I aren\u2019t dating, and you bring an extremely disreputable boyfriend, to show your uncle that, if he\u2019s not going to be supportive, then you\u2019re not going to bother dating socially appropriate men. Not an actual boyfriend, obviously,\u201d he adds, as Lan Wangji opens his mouth to protest this detail. \u201cYou find a fake date, someone who\u2019ll have steam coming out of Lan Qiren\u2019s ears, so that when you finally do bring a nice boy home, he\u2019ll be so relieved at the nice part that he\u2019ll forget to be so hung up about the boy.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a terrible plan: an absolute social catastrophe waiting to happen. Recent events aside, Lan Wangji is still a responsible, filial person, and the idea of deliberately setting up the heads of two major cultivation clans to be publicly humiliated goes against everything he\u2019s been brought up to believe in. But then he remembers his uncle\u2019s face as he yelled about sexual deviancy, which leads him to think of the only other time he\u2019s ever seen Lan Qiren anywhere near as angry, and as the memories overlap, he realizes he knows exactly who to ask to be his disreputable fake date.\n\u201cI know that look,\u201d says Jin Zixuan, annoyingly smug. \u201cYou like my plan, don\u2019t you? Admit it. Admit that you like my plan.\u201d\n\u201cI do not like your plan,\u201d says Lan Wangji, on principle. He waits a beat, then concedes, \u201cHowever, Xichen will likely approve of it, and I can\u2019t deny that it would be effective.\u201d Not to mention satisfying, a traitorous part of him adds. \u201cAnd\u2026 I think I know exactly who to bring.\u201d\nHe shoots Jin Zixuan a meaningful look, trusting him to make the same mental leap. They only have a handful of shared friends and acquaintances, and of those few, there\u2019s really only one person whose mere presence can be counted on to make the big vein in Lan Qiren\u2019s temple throb visibly, not least because he\u2019s been openly bisexual since their first year of university.\nAn awed, delighted, thoroughly devious expression creeps over Jin Zixuan\u2019s face. \u201cChaos gremlin,\u201d he breathes. \u201cFinally, a good use for Wei Wuxian!\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a chaos gremlin,\u201d says Lan Wangji, ignoring the way his ears heat up. \u201cHe\u2019s just\u2026 eccentric, sometimes. And loud.\u201d And very, very beautiful, adds the same unhelpful part of his brain that\u2019s countenancing any of this in the first place. \u201cAnd you know he\u2019d leap at the chance to annoy my uncle.\u201d\n\u201cWell, then, that\u2019s settled!\u201d Jin Zixuan says. \u201cYou confirm that it\u2019s all okay with Xichen, and once that\u2019s done, I\u2019ll contact Mianmian and the others, and you can bring in Wei Wuxian.\u201d\nLan Wangji ought to protest this. He should tell Jin Zixuan no and find a more restrained, less childish way to deal with his uncle\u2019s homophobia. \u201cAgreed,\u201d he says instead, and folds his hands in his lap to hide their trembling.\nThe first time Lan Wangji ever met Wei Wuxian, they were both fifteen, both students at the GusuLan indoctrination camp for junior cultivators held annually at Cloud Recesses, and both standing on top of a wall in the dark. Wei Wuxian had snuck out, flown his sword down the mountain to buy alcohol in Caiyi Town, and had been in the process of sneaking it back in when Lan Wangji had caught him redhanded. Wei Wuxian had grinned an unrepentant grin and tried everything from flirting to bribery to get Lan Wangji to let him go, and when that didn\u2019t work, they ended up dueling, evenly matched in a way that left Lan Wangji as furious as Wei Wuxian was breathless with laughter. When he finally prevailed, Lan Wangji dragged Wei Wuxian to Lan Qiren\u2019s office for punishment, only to find that in doing so, he\u2019d made a rod for his own back, as his uncle promptly tasked him with personally supervising Wei Wuxian\u2019s line-writing in the library.\nIt was during one such session that Wei Wuxian, as part of what felt like his ongoing campaign to destroy Lan Wangji\u2019s sanity, slipped some explicit gay pornography into his reading material. Lan Wangji almost dueled him over it there and then, but though his ears had burned as he shredded the offending paper, the image of one man bending another over a table remained seared into his consciousness, overlapping with his memory of the way Wei Wuxian had looked while sprawled on the ground \u2013 mouth laughing, eyes smiling, robe disheveled, legs splayed \u2013 in the aftermath of Lan Wangji knocking him over. He\u2019d had some vague inklings about his sexual preferences before that moment, but it was the close association of Wei Wuxian\u2019s mischievous good looks with actual hardcore pornography that catalyzed his first true moment of gay panic. As a result, he spent almost as much time that summer masturbating furiously to the thought of bending Wei Wuxian over a library table as he did arguing with him, which was to say: a lot.\nThe fantasies tapered off once they started at university and Lan Wangji, like almost every other freshman, discovered the heady delights of an internet connection unmonitored by family and a horny student populace. Still, though, he always felt a little flustered around Wei Wuxian, though Xichen was mercifully the only one who noticed this, and the fact that the pornography incident had somehow resulted in each of them calling the other by his given name was only a tiny part of it. Wei Wuxian was maddening: flirtatious, borderline anarchistic, easily distracted, loyal, shameless, fearless and, despite his habit of drinking too much, sleeping too little and studying almost never, academically brilliant. He\u2019d completed his three-year undergraduate degree with high distinction, then followed it up by blitzing a one-year honours course in talismanic practice, with several of his creations appearing in high-level cultivation journals. Lan Wangji, meanwhile, had opted to go straight into starting his masters on the parallel development of music as a tool within different cultivation traditions, and was now into his second year of study. He\u2019d expected Wei Wuxian to start his own masters this year, too \u2013 as had almost the whole cultivation faculty \u2013 and had therefore been completely taken aback to find that he\u2019d deferred his studies without any explanation beyond \u201cpersonal reasons.\u201d\nThe situation has been made all the more mysterious by the fact that, despite not technically being enrolled, Wei Wuxian is still clearly living close to the university. He\u2019s popped up once or twice at parties since the start of the year, but has either been glibly dismissive or coyly silent whenever anyone asks about his deferral, with the result that the rumours about his situation are as diverse as they are unfounded. And with Wei Wuxian\u2019s adoptive Jiang siblings now both living elsewhere \u2013 Jiang Yanli back at the family home, Jiang Cheng interning in Qinghe \u2013 there\u2019s no one around to give a truthful account of things; no one Lan Wangji can ask for advice in advance of approaching Wei Wuxian with this stupid, harebrained scheme.\nMore than once, in the days since Xichen approved Jin Zixuan\u2019s plan and first Mianmian, then the trio of Jin half-siblings agreed to participate, Lan Wangji has considered backing out of his part altogether. The idea of asking Wei Wuxian to be his fake date \u2013 of having to physically sit in front of him and make the request, knowing how easily he might be laughed at, if not turned down outright in honour of all the times he\u2019s chastised Wei Wuxian for failing to follow the rules \u2013 made his ears hot and his stomach twist. The only thing that stops him from reneging is the certain knowledge that, if he voices his reservations, Jin Zixuan will take the request to Wei Wuxian on Lan Wangji\u2019s behalf, if only for the comedic value, which is an even more mortifying prospect than being rejected in person.\nWhich is how, the following Saturday, Lan Wangji finds himself preparing to meet Wei Wuxian for lunch at a caf\u00e9 close to campus. He arranged the whole thing over text \u2013 he\u2019s had Wei Wuxian\u2019s number for years, though has seldom had cause to use it \u2013 and has half-convinced himself that Wei Wuxian will stand him up on principle. He is therefore shocked, on arriving at their meeting place a good ten minutes ahead of the agreed-upon time, to find that Wei Wuxian is there already. He spots him the moment he steps through the door and promptly comes to a halt, arrested by the sight of him. Wei Wuxian, handsome as always in his customary black and red, is seated at a corner booth. A full cup of bubble tea sits before him on the table, neglected as he looks worriedly at his phone. There\u2019s a dark-coloured lump on the bench beside him, and for a moment Lan Wangji mistakes it for a particularly large bag, until it moves and reveals itself to be, not a satchel, but the curved back of a small boy, aged surely no more than four, with dimpled cheeks and messy dark hair, who\u2019d evidently been reaching down to retrieve a dropped toy from beneath the table. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe toy in question is a small wooden dragonfly mounted on a stick. The little boy waves it in front of Wei Wuxian, distracting him from his phone. \u201cLook, gege! I got it!\u201d\n\u201cWell done, A-Yuan,\u201d Wei Wuxian tells him, flashing the boy a smile.\nLan Wangji is riveted to the spot, hardly breathing at the shock of it all, and is therefore wholly unprepared for Wei Wuxian to look up, spot him, and visibly freeze in place.\nThey stare at each other for two long seconds, neither one moving. Then, with an excruciating wrench of will, Lan Wangji makes himself walk forwards, nodding politely at Wei Wuxian as he slides into the opposite side of the booth.\n\u201cThank you for agreeing to meet me,\u201d he says, inanely.\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s no problem,\u201d says Wei Wuxian. His voice is strained, and his smile doesn\u2019t reach his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m, uh \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, my usual babysitter cancelled on me last minute, and I\u2019ve been trying to find a replacement, but \u2013\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to apologise,\u201d Lan Wangji says. \u201cI have no objections to children.\u201d\nWei Wuxian blinks at him, then seems to relax a little. Swallowing, he says, \u201cThis is \u2013 this is my son, A-Yuan. A-Yuan, this is my friend, Lan Zhan.\u201d\n\u201cHello, A-Yuan,\u201d says Lan Wangji, feeling distinctly like he\u2019s having an out-of-body experience. His son. Wei Wuxian has a son. \u201cIt\u2019s very nice to meet you.\u201d\n\u201cHello!\u201d says A-Yuan, beaming. \u201cAre you rich? You look rich. I have a dragonfly!\u201d He waves the stick excitedly.\n\u201cDragonflies are very beautiful,\u201d says Lan Wangji, and is absurdly relieved when A-Yuan nods in firm agreement.\n\u201cAll right, A-Yuan,\u201d says Wei Wuxian, immediately catching the boy\u2019s attention. \u201cNow, I need to have a boring grown-up talk with Lan Zhan, so why don\u2019t you drink your boba and watch your show \u2013\u201d he reaches down and grabs his actual bag from beneath the table, withdrawing a battered tablet in a chunky rubber case and a pair of children\u2019s headphones,\u00a0 \u201c\u2013 and if you\u2019re good, then afterwards, you can have a cookie.\u201d\nA-Yuan squints at him and held up a pair of fingers. \u201cTwo cookies?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe two cookies,\u201d Wei Wuxian allows.\n\u201cTwo cookies,\u201d A-Yuan repeats. He nods to himself, looking for all the world as if this has decided the matter, then grabs the headphones \u2013 only Wei Wuxian\u2019s quick reflexes save him from knocking over the bubble tea in his haste \u2013 and dons them with his father\u2019s assistance. Wei Wuxian fusses with the headphone cord, gets the tablet propped up just so, makes sure A-Yuan can hold his drink and use the straw without hindrance, and then turns back to Lan Wangji, smiling wryly.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he says again, more softly than before.\n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d says Lan Wangji, reaching over to squeeze his hand before he can think better of it. Wei Wuxian\u2019s skin is cool against the warmth of his palm, and he pulls back after scarcely a second, embarrassed for reasons he can\u2019t articulate. \u201cI already told you, there\u2019s no need to apologize.\u201d He cuts a glance at A-Yuan, now happily distracted by an educational cartoon, and says, unbearably awkward, \u201cSo, this is\u2026 he\u2019s why you didn\u2019t enroll this year?\u201d\nWei Wuxian nods, not meeting Lan Wangji\u2019s gaze. \u201cI\u2019m hoping to come back next year, once he\u2019s old enough to start kindergarten, but\u2026 this year, this first year, I wanted to be around for him as much as possible. Give him some stability, you know?\u201d\nThere\u2019s no polite way to ask the obvious questions \u2013 How long have you been a father? Where\u2019s his mother? Are you two together? \u2013 and so Lan Wangji finds himself saying instead, \u201cStability is important. He\u2019s lucky to have a father who\u2019s willing to spend so much time with him.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWei Wuxian jerks his head up, startled. \u201cYou actually mean that, don\u2019t you,\u201d he says, almost disbelieving. \u201cYou\u2019re really just\u2026 accepting this.\u201d\nLan Wangji gestures helplessly at A-Yuan. \u201cHe\u2019s your son. You clearly care for him. What is there not to accept?\u201d\nWei Wuxian stares at him, blinks, and finally bursts out laughing, smiling so big and bright that it makes Lan Wangji\u2019s chest hurt. \u201cLan Zhan, oh Lan Zhan. You really are too good.\u201d His smile softens as he glances again at A-Yuan. \u201cHis birth parents died when he was a baby; he\u2019s had friends and relatives looking after him since then, but the situation was never stable for any of them, and after \u2013 well. Let\u2019s just say that, near the end of last year, things got a bit complicated. He\u2019s known me for a while now, and there weren\u2019t any safer options, so I adopted him. Not quite how I expected to end up parenting, but I love him too much to have left him with strangers. He\u2019s worth it.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a good person,\u201d Lan Wangji says, the ache in his chest intensifying. \u201cA good father, too.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t know that,\u201d says Wei Wuxian, a flush creeping up his neck.\nLan Wangji shakes his head. \u201cWei Ying is good,\u201d he repeats, and is thankfully saved from having to explain himself by the timely arrival of a waitress. Lan Wangji hasn\u2019t so much as glanced at the menu, and hastily scans it as Wei Wuxian orders a spicy noodle dish and a soda for himself. After a moment of indecision, Lan Wangji asks for iced tea and slice of vegetarian frittata, fixing a polite expression on his face as the waitress writes everything down.\nWhen she\u2019s finally gone again, he seizes the chance to change the topic of conversation. \u201cI have a favour to ask you,\u201d he says, rushing in ahead of whatever Wei Wuxian was about to say. \u201cYou\u2019re under no obligation to help, obviously, but I\u2019d be willing to pay you for your time.\u201d\nAcross the table, Wei Wuxian sits up a little straighter. \u201cYou have my attention,\u201d he says, and proceeds to listen with increasing delight as Lan Wangji, ears burning hot, explains about the argument with Lan Qiren, the failed betrothal, his preference for men \u2013 Wei Wuxian\u2019s eyes go huge at that, but he refrains from comment \u2013 and the subsequent plan developed by Jin Zixuan, including the fact that Mianmian, Xichen and the Jin siblings are already on board. The only detail he omits is the ugly truth about Qin Su\u2019s origins, which doesn\u2019t feel like his secret to share; he says only that she\u2019s a newly-discovered half-sister to Jin Zixuan and leaves it at that.\n\u201cAnd, well,\u201d he says, faltering now that the background details are out of the way. \u201cWithout wanting to insult you, I can\u2019t think of anyone my uncle would object to seeing as my partner more than you, and I know you\u2019ve always enjoyed provoking him, so I was hoping that maybe \u2013\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d says Wei Wuxian, grinning from ear to ear. \u201cLan Zhan, yes, I will absolutely be your obnoxious fake date to your brother\u2019s birthday! I\u2019m so happy you asked! Let\u2019s see: we can say we\u2019ve been dating since, oh, the end of last semester, so nearly five months. Remember I threw that party to celebrate finishing my honours year? We\u2019ll say got together then \u2013 I finally won you over with a combination of academic genius and raw sexual magnetism \u2013\u201d\n\u201cWei Ying.\u201d\n\u201c\u2013 and since then, we\u2019ve been seeing each other regularly off-campus, whenever time permits.\u201d He grins again, propping his chin on his hands. \u201cJust so you know, I\u2019m very comfortable with PDA. Public displays of affection,\u201d he adds, when Lan Wangji raises an eyebrow at the acronym. \u201cObviously, we can work out the full details later, but I\u2019m thinking plenty of hand-holding, lap-sitting and a few strategic makeout sessions should do the trick.\u201d\nLan Wangji chokes on air, and is once more rescued \u2013 mercifully, bless her, he will tip fifty percent even if the food tastes like cardboard \u2013 by the return of the waitress, who sets their lunch in front of them, asks if there\u2019s anything else she can do, and then bustles off again. Lan Wangji starts eating his frittata with unseemly vigour, trying and failing to banish the thought of touching Wei Wuxian, holding him, kissing him, all with his enthusiastic permission. It hardly seems possible that the need for feigned intimacy to sell the relationship hadn\u2019t occurred to him before this moment, and yet the practicalities have caught him completely off guard. He\u2019s hardly the same blushing virgin he was at the start of university (or even during the GusuLan indoctrination camp, for that matter); there\u2019s no good reason why the prospect of kissing someone he\u2019s known for the better part of eight years should make him feel hot all over, no matter how prominent a role he played in Lan Wangji\u2019s early sexual fantasies.\nAnd yet. And yet. He eats his food and sips his tea, and somehow gets himself sufficiently under control to say, once he\u2019s washed down the last bite of frittata, \u201cWe should practice beforehand, to see what we\u2019re both comfortable with.\u201d\nAcross the table, Wei Wuxian coughs violently as some of his soda goes up his nose. \u201cThat \u2013 makes sense,\u201d he gasps out, thumping himself on the chest. \u201cRemind me, when\u2019s the \u2013 party?\u201d\n\u201cNext Sunday,\u201d Lan Wangji says, passing him a napkin. Some of the soda must\u2019ve gone down Wei Wuxian\u2019s windpipe, too, the way he\u2019s still wheezing for air. He\u2019s loud enough that A-Yuan looks up from his cartoon, frowning in adorable concern. Carefully, he sets his now-empty cup on the table and pats Wei Wuxian\u2019s shoulder with a small, chubby hand.\n\u201cDrink slow, Xian-gege,\u201d he says. Wei Wuxian nods, still sucking in air, and after a moment, A-Yuan returns his attention to the tablet, evidently satisfied that his wisdom has been accepted. \u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cAll right,\u201d says Wei Wuxian, voice finally returning to normal. \u201cAll right, that\u2019s \u2013 my schedule is pretty free, so tell me whenever you\u2019re available between now and then, and we can meet up to, uh, explore the practicalities.\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d says Lan Wangji. \u201cThank you, Wei Ying. I truly appreciate it.\u201d\n\u201cNo need to thank me!\u201d Wei Wuxian says, flashing a bright smile. \u201cWhat are friends for? Frankly, I\u2019d gladly annoy your uncle for free any day of the week, but here you are offering me money and a party invite into the bargain, too. How could I resist?\u201d\n\u201cEven so,\u201d says Lan Wangji, feeling an obscure need to make this clear, \u201cI am grateful. I\u2019ve been\u2026 judgmental of you in the past, unfairly so, and you\u2019d be well within your rights to have turned me down.\u201d\n\u201cLan Zhan \u2013\u201d\n\u201cI just don\u2019t want you to think,\u201d he says, frustrated that he\u2019s not expressing this clearly enough, \u201cthat I don\u2019t value you as a person. That I\u2019m asking because I think you\u2019re disreputable, instead of because my uncle does. Because I do. Value you, I mean. As a person.\u201d He stares at Wei Wuxian, hoping he\u2019s got the point across. \u201cYou are not disreputable, Wei Ying. Anyone would be lucky to have you as a partner. It\u2019s only my uncle who\u2019s too blind to see it, and after what he said to me, I need \u2013\u201d he gestures helplessly, fingers flexing against empty air, and says, more raw than he means to be, \u201cI need him to see me. I need to him to know that I\u2019m not like him, not constrained by his biases. That his inability to see the worth in either of us is his failing, not ours.\u201d\nWei Wuxian laughs softly, ducking his head. \u201cHanguang-Jun, you shouldn\u2019t flatter me like that. I\u2019m only a humble single father, I\u2019ll get ideas and then where will we be?\u201d He grins a crooked grin, and before Lan Wangji can insist that it wasn\u2019t flattery at all, just the truth, Wei Wuxian leans out of his seat, flags a passing waitress and asks her to bring him two cookies.\n\u201cHe\u2019s really been very good,\u201d he says, tipping his head to indicate A-Yuan.\n\u201cDefinitely deserving of two cookies,\u201d Lan Wangji agrees gravely.\nThe cookies arrive within minutes, and A-Yuan is so excited that he gets tangled up in the headphone cord. While a laughing Wei Wuxian helps to disentangle him, Lan Wangji stealthily makes his way to the counter and pays for them both, making his tip exactly as generous as he\u2019d promised he would. He feels serenely smug when he sits back down again, and Wei Wuxian is so busy packing up A-Yuan\u2019s things that it takes him much longer than usual to catch on. When he does, however, his eyes narrow.\n\u201cYou,\u201d he says accusingly, pointing a finger at Lan Wangji. \u201cYou paid, didn\u2019t you!\u201d\n\u201cIt was my pleasure,\u201d says Lan Wangji, indulging in a very slight smile. \u00a0\n\u201cRich-gege paid?\u201d asks A-Yuan, looking up from his cookie.\n\u201cHe did,\u201d says Wei Wuxian, \u201cwhich means that next time, we have to be extra quick and make sure to pay for him instead.\u201d\nA-Yuan nods seriously. \u201cPaying is imptant.\u201d\n\u201cIm-por-tant,\u201d Wei Wuxian corrects gently, enunciating the syllables.\nA-Yuan frowns in concentration. \u201cImp-rortant.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWei Wuxian laughs. \u201cThat\u2019s close enough.\u201d\nThey linger in the booth for as long as it takes A-Yuan to finish the rest of the cookie. Wei Wuxian tidies up the spilled crumbs as best he can \u2013 \u201cNo need to make extra work for the waitress,\u201d he says, helping A-Yuan to wipe his hands on a napkin \u2013 and then they file out together, Wei Wuxian lifting his son onto his hip with practiced ease.\n\u201cI\u2019ll let Jin Zixuan know that we\u2019re going ahead with it,\u201d Lan Wangji says, then hesitates. \u201cIf you\u2019d rather I not mention A-Yuan to him, I understand \u2013\u201d\n\u201cNo, no.\u201d Wei Wuxian gives a rueful laugh. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for secrecy. A-Yuan\u2019s my son, it\u2019s right that people know about him. I only kept it quiet at first while the paperwork was going through, and after that, we were busy getting settled in together. But I trust you to let people know.\u201d\n\u201cMy thanks,\u201d says Lan Wangji, who can\u2019t think of what else to say. \u201cI\u2019ll, ah. Text you about meeting up again before Sunday; I just need to check my calendar.\u201d\n\u201cAll right, then,\u201d says Wei Wuxian. \u201cA-Yuan, we\u2019re headed home now. Say goodbye to Lan Zhan!\u201d\nA-Yuan waves cheerfully at him. \u201cBye-bye, rich-gege!\u201d\n\u201cGoodbye,\u201d says Lan Wangji. He returns the wave, feeling awkward as he does so, but Wei Wuxian smiles at him in a way that makes him feel like he did the right thing, and then he\u2019s turning, walking back to his campus office to research his thesis, grade homework, and catch Jin Zixuan up on this latest development in their very un-filial plot.\n\u201cHow did this happen,\u201d he mutters softly to himself.\nUnsurprisingly, he doesn\u2019t receive an answer.\nBy mutual agreement, Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian agree to meet the following Wednesday afternoon \u2013 this time at Lan Wangji\u2019s apartment, while A-Yuan is off at playgroup \u2013 to practice their dating routine. The fact that said practice will likely involve kissing, hand-holding and other small intimacies is a reality that Lan Wangji shoves very firmly to the back of his mind. He\u2019s going to be a gentleman about this, inasmuch as that\u2019s possible under the circumstances, and being a gentleman means not masturbating about Wei Wuxian in the days beforehand just because some deep-seated part of his libido is still primed to get overly excited about him.\nIt\u2019s not until the last half-hour before Wei Wuxian is due to arrive that Lan Wangji realizes, far too late, that he\u2019s made a tactical error. Having been unable to get Wei Wuxian out of his head for the past five days, he\u2019s ended up not masturbating during that time at all, with the result that he\u2019s now \u2013 noticeably, embarrassingly \u2013 much hornier than usual. He\u2019s so annoyed at the oversight that, instead of doing the sensible thing and having a quick, perfunctory orgasm to calm himself down, he spends so long mentally weighing the pros and cons that, by the time he finally decides on a course of action, he\u2019s run out of time. The doorbell rings at exactly 4pm, and Lan Wangji, despite having thought of little else but this all day, is woefully unprepared for it.\n\u201cFuck,\u201d he mutters softly, and goes to admit his guest.\n\u201cLan Zhan!\u201d says Wei Wuxian, practically bouncing on the doorstep. His long hair is tied half-up with his customary red ribbon, his legs are clad in black skinny jeans tucked into lace-up black boots, and he\u2019s wearing a bright red crop-top that proclaims, in big, black letters, SAVE A SWORD, RIDE A SOCIALIST.\nLan Wangji stares at the shirt. It\u2019s short enough that a startling amount of Wei Wuxian\u2019s toned, lean stomach is visible, and yet it\u2019s also so loose and wide-necked that it\u2019s half skewing off his right shoulder, showing a long stretch of collarbone. Even without the slogan, it\u2019s wildly inappropriate for any sort of cultivation gathering, and it takes a painfully long moment for Lan Wangji to remember that this is, in fact, the point: that Wei Wuxian had said he\u2019d be wearing the outfit he was planning to wear on Sunday, so that Lan Wangji could approve it ahead of time.\n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d he says, still staring at the shirt. \u201cAh. Please, come in.\u201d\n\u201cDo you like it?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks, doing an impish twirl as he steps past Lan Wangji, bending to remove his shoes. \u201cI had it custom made, and I\u2019ve been dying for an excuse to wear it, but if you think it\u2019s too much \u2013\u201d\n\u201cIt looks perfect,\u201d says Lan Wangji, whose brain to mouth filter has apparently ceased to exist. \u201cI mean, it is perfect. Will be, for the party.\u201d\nWei Wuxian does a little fist-pump as they enter the lounge, which Lan Wangji outright refuses to find endearing. \u201cYes!\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re the best, Lan Zhan. Truly, there is no greater gift you could give me than the look on Lan Qiren\u2019s face when he sees this fashion masterpiece.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind,\u201d says Lan Wangji wryly.\n\u201cBut \u2013 oh.\u201d Wei Wuxian stills, a guilty look creeping over his face. \u201cBefore we get to anything else, though, I need to tell you that there\u2019s been a\u2026 complication.\u201d\nFrowning slightly, Lan Wangji sits, gesturing for Wei Wuxian to do likewise. \u201cWhat sort of complication?\u201d\nWei Wuxian takes a deep breath. \u201cI have to bring A-Yuan.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d says Lan Wangji, relieved it\u2019s not something serious. \u201cIs that all? It\u2019s no trouble whatsoever; I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be other children there, too. I can let Xichen know easily.\u201d\nWei Wuxian winces. \u201cThank you, but it\u2019s not \u2013 what I mean is, the complication is why I have to bring him. See, the thing about this being your brother\u2019s birthday is that Jiang Cheng and my shijie are already invited \u2013 and Uncle Jiang and Madam Yu, too, but they\u2019re not able to make it. I swear, I didn\u2019t know when you asked me,\u201d he says quickly, as though this is somehow his fault and not a monumental oversight on Lan Wangji\u2019s part, \u201cbut A-Li called me yesterday to see if I\u2019d been invited, too, and when I told her I\u2019d be there, she insisted I bring A-Yuan along, so that she can see her nephew. Which also means,\u201d says Wei Wuxian, twisting his fingers together, \u201cthat we\u2019re also going to have to pretend to date in front of my family.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d says Lan Wangji.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to do it anymore, I completely understand,\u201d Wei Wuxian says in a rush. \u201cJust, I\u2019d really appreciate it if I can still come along, because otherwise I\u2019ll have to make up a lie about why I won\u2019t be there, and I really don\u2019t want to disappoint my shijie.\u201d\n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d says Lan Wangji, startled. \u201cOf course you can still come, but are you sure you want to do this? You shouldn\u2019t have to lie to your family just for my sake, and especially because it involves your son \u2013\u201d\n\u201cI want to help,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, determined. He meets Lan Wangji\u2019s gaze, dark eyes bright. \u201cWhat your uncle said to you \u2013 what he tried to do \u2013 it\u2019s inexcusable. You\u2019ve always been the most perfect son, done everything he\u2019s ever asked of you more flawlessly than he\u2019s had any right to expect, and then the very first time you assert yourself \u2013 the one time you ask him to accept you on your terms instead of his \u2013 he as good as calls you a reprobate and says you don\u2019t get to love anyone if it doesn\u2019t make him comfortable?\u201d He makes an angry noise. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong, and I know he\u2019s your family, but he shouldn\u2019t be allowed to get away with it. Even if it\u2019s only for one day, he deserves to feel exactly as uncomfortable as I can make him.\u201d He looks away and adds, more softly, \u201cI know what it\u2019s like, to be brought up by someone... someone other than your parents, and to have them hold that over you like they were only ever investing in a disciple, not raising a child.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nA loaded silence follows.\n\u201cIn that case,\u201d Lan Wangji says, his mouth once more running ahead of his common sense, \u201cwe should probably change our backstory.\u201d\nWei Wuxian lifts his head, a look of startled hope on his face. \u201cYou mean it?\u201d\n\u201cMn.\u201d He tips his head, considering. \u201cA-Yuan has only just met me, and we can\u2019t expect him to lie about that, so\u2026 we should say we\u2019ve only been together for a few weeks. We\u2019ve known each other as friends for years, so nobody can say we\u2019re rushing into it, but obviously we\u2019ve been taking it slow because you\u2019ve got A-Yuan to think about now.\u201d\nWei Wuxian laughs, a little breathlessly. \u201cOf course, you\u2019re right. Can\u2019t have him getting all excited about the prospect of a second father if we\u2019re not sure how the relationship will pan out.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s only sensible,\u201d Lan Wangji agrees. \u201cSo this, coming to Xichen\u2019s birthday, it\u2019s obviously our first public appearance as a couple.\u201d\n\u201cObviously,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cAnd normally, I\u2019d be trying to make a good impression, but I was very upset by what your uncle said to you \u2013 which, let\u2019s face it, from what you\u2019ve told me, that\u2019s going to be common knowledge \u2013 and everyone knows I\u2019ve never gotten along with him anyway, so nobody will think I\u2019m acting out of character if I opt to rub it in.\u201d\n\u201cPerfect,\u201d says Lan Wangji. \u201cDetails, then \u2013 let\u2019s work it out.\u201d\nAs though they\u2019re once again undergraduates working on a group project, they put their heads together and carefully concoct a simple but plausible story: that, a week before the fight with Lan Qiren, Lan Wangji met up with Wei Wuxian to find out why he wasn\u2019t enrolled this year. As they admitted to missing each other, a mutual attraction was realized, and after talking it over, they agreed to give it a try on the quiet, not wanting to involve A-Yuan too early. The \u201cdate\u201d at the caf\u00e9 was Lan Wangji\u2019s first trial meeting with A-Yuan, to see how they got along, and as it went well, they\u2019re now all coming to the party together. A-Yuan, of course, knows only that Lan Wangji is a friend; should things go well, they\u2019ll explain the relationship to him in more detail at a later date.\n\u201cThe only problem is,\u201d says Wei Wuxian, once all this has been agreed upon, \u201cthat at some point, I\u2019ll have to tell shijie we\u2019ve broken up. Not straight away, obviously \u2013 that would be suspicious \u2013 but it\u2019s not like she\u2019s living close by anymore, so we won\u2019t have to go on any other fake dates to throw her off the scent.\u201d\n\u201cI would, though, if it was necessary,\u201d Lan Wangji feels compelled to add. \u201cAfter all, you\u2019re doing this for me; it would be hypocritical not to do the same for you, too.\u201d\n\u201cWell, thank you,\u201d says Wei Wuxian, grinning at him. \u201cAnd of course, you breaking up with me will make perfect sense to everyone, so there\u2019s no need to worry about that side of things.\u201d\nLan Wangji frowns. \u201cWhat do you mean, my breaking up with you makes sense?\u201d\nWei Wuxian rolls his eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t be dense.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not being dense; I just want to make sure we\u2019re on the same page, and I don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re saying.\u201d\n\u201cLan Zhan, really!\u201d Wei Wuxian laughs. \u201cYou\u2019re Hanguang-Jun, one of the Twin Jades of Lan, whereas I am an orphaned nobody. You have endless career prospects anywhere in the cultivation world, whereas I can\u2019t even get a job with my home sect. You\u2019re extremely out of my league, and even if that wasn\u2019t true, not a single person would blame you for deciding that actually, you\u2019re not ready to sign on for long-term co-parenting. There\u2019s plenty of reasons why you\u2019d break up with me.\u201d\nLan Wangji stares at him, chest twisting at the ease with which Wei Wuxian dismisses himself. \u201cBut that\u2019s not right,\u201d he finds himself saying. \u201cBloodlines aren\u2019t important to me, and I know they\u2019re not important to you \u2013 why should I care about your origins more than I care about who you are? If the YunmengJiang don\u2019t want to employ you, that\u2019s a failing on their part; any sect or clan would be lucky to have a cultivator of your talents. I don\u2019t agree that I\u2019m out of your league \u2013 if anything, you\u2019re out of mine. You\u2019re good with people, you\u2019re thoughtful and generous; you make wonderful art and music; and you were brave enough to come out years ago, which means you\u2019ve got more relationship experience than me. And as for not wanting to co-parent, that\u2019s not\u2026 if that was truly an issue, I\u2019d never have asked you to date me in the first place. We might break up for any number of reasons, but that would never be one of them.\u201d\nA beat of silence follows this proclamation. Then:\n\u201cAh, Lan Zhan,\u201d says Wei Wuxian, softly. He runs a hand down his face and laughs a quiet, tired laugh, looking up at him through his lashes. \u201cEven in a story, you\u2019re too good to be true. Very well, if you insist \u2013 when we get to that point, I\u2019ll tell everyone that I broke up with you, and nobody will be surprised that I was too foolish to recognize a good thing when I had it.\u201d\nSomething catches in Lan Wangji\u2019s throat. \u201cWei Ying \u2013\u201d\n\u201cWe should kiss now, I think,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, suddenly enough that Lan Wangji completely loses his train of thought. \u201cMake sure we\u2019ll be prepared on the day.\u201d\n\u201cYes \u2013 I mean, only if you want to \u2013 if you\u2019re comfortable with it \u2013\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m plenty comfortable,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, and before Lan Wangji can muster up any more words, Wei Wuxian climbs onto his lap, straddling his thighs. Heart beating hard, Lan Wangji stares at him, lips parted on a question he doesn\u2019t know how to ask. Smiling impishly, Wei Wuxian twines his arms around Lan Wangji\u2019s neck and leans in slowly. His eyes fall closed, and Lan Wangji shuts his own in turn, abruptly overwhelmed by the gentle brush of Wei Wuxian\u2019s nose against his cheek, the soft huff of his laughter. He turns his mouth blindly, seeking, lips ghosting across Wei Wuxian\u2019s jaw even as his hands, acting wholly on their own initiative, settle on Wei Wuxian\u2019s hips.\n\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian whispers, and then they\u2019re kissing, a press of mouths that stays chaste for all of a second before Lan Wangji deepens it, groaning as Wei Wuxian kisses back. Heat licks through him, urgent and shameless. It\u2019s been nearly a year since he last had a partner, the novelty of brief encounters long since having worn off despite what he let Jin Zixuan infer, and combined with his recent abstinence, his whole body feels electrified. Wei Wuxian\u2019s fingers are in his hair, and Lan Wangji is moved to squeeze his hips, tugging him closer. Wei Wuxian kisses him like he\u2019s drowning, and Lan Wangji is helpless to do anything but respond in kind. He dreamed of this so often when he was younger, and now that it\u2019s a reality, he can\u2019t understand why he ever stopped; why his fantasies have ever resembled anything other than this.\nWei Wuxian whines in his throat, breath hitching as he grinds down. He\u2019s hard in his jeans \u2013 as hard as Lan Wangji is himself \u2013 and when he breaks away for air, his cheeks are flushed, his eyes blown dark. Lan Wangji drinks in the sight, then leans in and kisses beneath Wei Wuxian\u2019s jaw, sucking lightly at the skin.\n\u201cOh fuck,\u201d Wei Wuxian gasps. \u201cLan Zhan, Lan er-gege, you\u2019ll leave a mark \u2013\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want a mark?\u201d Lan Wangji murmurs, the words Lan er-gege atomizing his higher brain functions.\n\u201cI do,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, voice turning thready as Lan Wangji sets his mouth to his throat, \u201cI just \u2013 oh, fuuuuck.\u201d He shudders bodily, panting as Lan Wangji sucks a hickey into the delicate skin, and the second Lan Wangji pulls back to admire his handiwork, Wei Wuxian is on him again, kissing with a desperation that has Lan Wangji\u2019s pulse hammering in his ears.\nWe should stop, a distant part of him thinks, this was meant to be practice, not \u2013 whatever it is we\u2019re doing now, but he\u2019s so turned on he can barely think. His hands slide up, stroking at all the soft, bare skin revealed by Wei Wuxian\u2019s crop top, until his thumbs are brushing against small, hard nipples, and Wei Wuxian is keening into his mouth.\n\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he gasps, \u201cLan Zhan, I know \u2013 I know this was meant to be practice, but I haven\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s been so long, fuck, can we just \u2013 can we just call this a one-off and \u2013\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Lan Wangji rasps, and somehow shoves himself to his feet with Wei Wuxian still clinging to him. There\u2019s a precarious moment where his balance wavers, and then those long, lean legs are wrapping around his waist, that bright, clever mouth lipping at his throat, and there\u2019s no power on earth, cultivation or otherwise, that could stop him from carrying Wei Wuxian into his bedroom and dropping him on the mattress. Wei Wuxian exhales hard as he lands, their gazes locked for a heated moment, and then they\u2019re both undressing, Lan Wangji letting his clothes drop with uncharacteristic unconcern as Wei Wuxian shimmies out of his stupidly tight jeans. Lan Wangji watches greedily, hard in his briefs, and lets out an involuntary noise when Wei Wuxian sprawls back again, dressed in nothing but the crop top and \u2013 his mouth goes dry \u2013 a pair of red panties.\n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d he says, and whatever expression he\u2019s wearing makes Wei Wuxian flush all the way down his throat.\n\u201cWould you believe me if I said they were part of the outfit?\u201d he asks weakly.\n\u201cDon\u2019t care,\u201d says Lan Wangji, and climbs on top of him, caging Wei Wuxian in with his arms as he leans down to kiss him again. Wei Wuxian melts into it, legs parting to make space for Lan Wangji between them. Their kisses turn biting, a sharp, playful tease, but even though they\u2019ve never done this together before, there\u2019s an impossible harmony to every bit of give and take between them.\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Wei Wuxian breathes against his ear. \u201cWhat do you want, Lan er-gege?\u201d\nYou, Lan Wangji thinks wildly, and only by the skin of his self-preserving teeth does he not say so out loud. Instead, he reaches down between them, stroking Wei Wuxian through the satiny fabric of his panties. Wei Wuxian moans in response, hips canting up as Lan Wangji snugs the panties beneath his balls to take him fully in hand.\n\u201cNo fair, you too,\u201d Wei Wuxian laughs, and grabs the band of Lan Wangji\u2019s briefs, tugging them down his thighs to stroke him in turn. It ought to be awkward, and on some level it is, but it\u2019s also incredibly hot. Each of them has a hand on the other, knuckles bumping where their bodies meet; they\u2019re kissing, laughing, gasping in pleasure, tipping onto their sides with their foreheads pressed together. It\u2019s straightforwardly perfect, arousal coiling through Lan Wangji with every stroke of Wei Wuxian\u2019s hand, the feedback of Wei Wuxian\u2019s noises winding him tighter and tighter until he\u2019s coming with a groan, back arching as he spills between them.\n\u201cOh fuck,\u201d Wei Wuxian gasps, and leans in to kiss him as he comes in turn. It\u2019s a shallow kiss, oddly sweet for all the frenzy that led them here, and Lan Wangji can feel it when Wei Wuxian smiles against his mouth. Both sheened with sweat, they steady their breathing in the aftermath, and Lan Wangji keeps waiting for the shame to come, the sinking certainty that he\u2019s made a mistake, but it never does. He just feels\u2026 light, impossibly so, the same way he did the first time he successfully imbued a talisman with his spiritual energy as a child. It\u2019s inconceivable that what just happened shouldn\u2019t have happened: he knows there must be a reason why he was worried about it, but in the moment, he\u2019s too endorphin-high to remember what it was.\n\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian murmurs. \u201cLan Zhan, are you falling asleep?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d says Lan Wangji, for all that he hadn\u2019t quite realized that his eyes were shut. He makes an effort and opens them, unable to keep from smiling at the sight of Wei Wuxian\u2019s face, so close to his own, and then, point proven, lets them fall closed again. \u201c\u2019m awake.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t fall asleep right after a hookup, Lan Zhan, it\u2019s bad manners!\u201d\n\u201cI am very polite,\u201d Lan Wangji mumbles, and blindly presses a kiss to Wei Wuxian\u2019s cheek to prove it. \u201cSee?\u201d\nWei Wuxian laughs, the sound high and breathless. \u201cSo polite, truly. Do you have tissues? Please tell me you have tissues.\u201d\nLan Wangji groans, belatedly aware of the fact that they\u2019re both lying in their own shared mess, and forces himself to sit up. \u201cI\u2019ll get a washcloth,\u201d he says, and before Wei Wuxian can protest this, he swings his legs over the foot of the bed, performs a small, undignified jig to remove his briefs \u2013 he tosses them straight in the laundry hamper as if shooting a basketball, earning a startled bark of laughter from Wei Wuxian \u2013 and walks, shamelessly nude, to the bathroom.\nHe glimpses himself in the bathroom mirror, ears heating at how much redder his cheeks and mouth are than usual, how disheveled his hair is. Refusing to be distracted, he cleans himself up, then wets a washcloth with warm water, wrings out the excess, and carries it back to Wei Wuxian, who\u2019s half sitting up to take off his now-unwearable panties.\n\u201cHere,\u201d says Lan Wangji, and because he\u2019s clearly taken permanent leave of his senses, instead of simply handing over the cloth, he kneels down at the bedside and gently cleans Wei Wuxian up himself, ignoring the startled inhale this earns him.\n\u201cYou really are polite,\u201d says Wei Wuxian, grinning crookedly. He is still \u2013 absurdly, beautifully \u2013 wearing nothing but the SAVE A SWORD, RIDE A SOCIALIST crop top, and at some point Lan Wangji is going to have to examine how fond this makes him feel, but that time isn\u2019t now, because he\u2019s too busy watching as Wei Wuxian comes to his feet, stretches theatrically and asks, \u201cMay I have my pants back, please?\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d says Lan Wangji, handing them over. He is still, himself, naked and kneeling, and this doesn\u2019t change as Wei Wuxian pokes out his tongue and tugs his jeans back on \u2013 commando this time, as the panties now require a wash. It\u2019s not until Wei Wuxian triumphantly does up the button and looks at him that Lan Wangji realizes the absurdity of his own position. Ears burning anew, he walks to his dresser and pulls out a clean pair of boxer-briefs, stepping into them with his back turned to Wei Wuxian.\n\u201cSo,\u201d says Wei Wuxian cheerfully. \u201cI think it\u2019s clear we\u2019ll be fine with PDA at the party.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d says Lan Wangji, turning around. He feels abruptly like he\u2019s missed a step; like there\u2019s something important he ought to be saying or doing, if only he knew what it was. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it,\u201d he adds, which is true, but also not quite what he thinks he means.\nWei Wuxian grins at him. \u201cI\u2019ll bet you are,\u201d he says, mock-flirtatious. \u201cRemember, though, we\u2019ll have to keep it pretty PG around A-Yuan; I don\u2019t want to scar him for life.\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d says Lan Wangji. He\u2019s still only wearing his underwear, and he has a vague notion that he ought to put some clothes on, offer to make them both some food, but before he can sort it all out, Wei Wuxian\u2019s phone, which has evidently remained in his jeans pocket this entire time, starts chirping loudly. Wei Wuxian swears and fishes it out, turning off what is evidently a preset alarm.\n\u201cI have to go pick A-Yuan up from playgroup,\u201d he says, a flash of apology in his eyes. \u201cI swear, I\u2019d stick around otherwise, I just \u2013\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d says Lan Wangji. \u201cHe\u2019s your son. He needs you.\u201d\nWei Wuxian smiles at him, big and bright and impossibly soft. \u201cHe\u2019s looking forward to seeing you again,\u201d he says. \u201cYou bought him two cookies, which means you\u2019re a friend for life.\u201d\n\u201cYou gave him the cookies, though.\u201d\n\u201cMere semantics. Trust me, four-year-olds have very firm opinions about these things.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the expert,\u201d Lan Wangji says, and doesn\u2019t know what to do with how his chest aches at Wei Wuxian\u2019s answering peal of laughter.\nThey move back out to the front door, Lan Wangji hovering as Wei Wuxian pulls on his boots and fixes his hair in the hall mirror. The hickey is visible on his throat, and Lan Wangji feels some kind of way about it.\n\u201cThere! Do I look presentable? Can\u2019t have the other parents thinking I\u2019m a total deadbeat.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not any sort of deadbeat,\u201d Lan Wangji says, frowning. \u201cWei Ying is an excellent parent.\u201d\n\u201cAh, Lan Zhan.\u201d Wei Wuxian smiles at him again, the expression somehow more private than before \u2013 and then, before Lan Wangji can fully process what\u2019s happening, Wei Wuxian leans in and kisses him softly on the cheek. \u201cWe\u2019ll meet you here on Sunday morning for the drive down, okay?\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d says Lan Wangji, stupidly. \u201cGoodbye, Wei Ying.\u201d\n\u201cGoodbye,\u201d says Wei Wuxian, and with a final, parting grin, he leaves.\nLan Wangji stares at the door for several long seconds, trying and failing to process what just happened. He\u2019s still in his underwear, and when he finally makes himself return to the bedroom to put on some clothes, he finds that Wei Wuxian\u2019s panties are still on his floor. The sight of them freezes him briefly in place; then he picks them up, puts them in the hamper, and decides that he needs a shower.\nHe blanks a bit as he runs the taps, but once he\u2019s inside, warm water sluicing over him, he lets out a groan and presses his head to the tiled wall. So much for being a gentleman, he thinks, a little hysterically. How did the afternoon get so far away from him? It would be easy, convenient to believe that the sole fault was his own: that, if he\u2019d either gotten off his high horse or out of his head for long enough to masturbate at some point in the past five days, he would\u2019ve been less affected by Wei Wuxian, better able to slow things down. He wants to believe it, but the habit of honesty is too ingrained. Horny or not, there\u2019s nothing to explain why he suddenly felt the need to put a mark on Wei Wuxian\u2019s neck, or \u2013 more importantly \u2013 why Wei Wuxian let him. Both of them were enthusiastic participants, and for all that Lan Wangji can\u2019t bring himself to regret it, he still doesn\u2019t understand what it means. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nTechnically, Wei Wuxian had asked to call it a one-off. Technically, Lan Wangji had even agreed. But it hadn\u2019t exactly been a detailed conversation, and Lan Wangji feels very strongly that the matter should be revisited at some point in the future, preferably soon, although perhaps \u2013 he winces slightly \u2013 not before Sunday. Xichen\u2019s party will be emotionally fraught enough for the pair of them as it is; there\u2019s nothing to be gained by trying to, to agree to anything before then, when the experience might well be enough to put them off each other. \u00a0\u00a0\nAgree to what? he asks himself, uncomfortably aware that part of him already knows the answer. Dizzy from more than the heat, he gets out of the shower, dries himself off, and pulls on his softest, most comfortable house clothes before curling up on the couch, his feet tucked under a blanket and a cup of hot tea in his hands. He thinks about Wei Wuxian, who has always been as beautiful as he is maddening \u2013 or at least, who used to be maddening. Now that he comes to think of it, it\u2019s been a while since Wei Wuxian did anything to genuinely get under Lan Wangji\u2019s skin \u2013 since they were undergraduates, at least. The rest is just Wei Wuxian\u2019s exuberant personality brushing up against Lan Wangji\u2019s memories of his younger self, the latter perception ensuring he\u2019s kept a certain distance from the only out, queer friend he\u2019s ever had; a smart, clever, thoughtful man who flirted with him outrageously when they were teenagers and who has never stopped being beautiful \u2013\n\nOh. \n\nVery calmly, Lan Wangji sets down his tea and pulls out his phone. He calls Jin Zixuan, and is equal parts relieved and disappointed when he answers.\n\u201cWangji! To what do I owe the pleasure?\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know when you\u2019ve been an idiot about someone?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know,\u201d Lan Wangji repeats, \u201cwhen you\u2019ve been an idiot? About someone. And what do you do to fix it?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026In what context?\u201d\n\u201cA general sort of context,\u201d Lan Wangji hedges. \u201cYou\u2019re more experienced at being an idiot than me, so I thought you might have some advice.\u201d \u00a0\nJin Zixuan hangs up on him.\nLan Wangji stares at his phone and silently counts to twenty. When he reaches nineteen, the phone rings again and he picks up. \u201cHello, Jin Zixuan.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re an absolute bitch,\u201d Jin Zixuan grouses. \u201cBut okay, fine, whatever, I\u2019ll bite. My curiosity is piqued. But I need more to go on here than just being an idiot to someone. The medium in which I work requires context, Hanguang-Jun.\u201d\nLan Wangji shuts his eyes. \u201cHypothetically,\u201d he says, \u201csay you meet a person, and you start out thinking of them in a sexual way, but there\u2019s no possibility of it going anywhere, and also they drive you crazy. Subsequently, you meet them again, but this time there is a possibility that it could go somewhere, but only if you were brave enough. The problem is, you aren\u2019t ready to be brave enough, but you don\u2019t want to admit it to yourself in those terms, so instead you build up a sort of\u2026 a sort of false belief, I guess, in your head, that all they ever do is drive you crazy, because otherwise you\u2019d have to deal with how attractive they are, and how kind and intelligent, and how the only reason nothing has ever happened there is because you\u2019re too scared to try. But then, when you finally get to a point where you\u2019re no longer scared, and you realize that what you\u2019ve been telling yourself about them isn\u2019t true, it\u2019s suddenly really complicated, because now they\u2019re a single parent and you\u2019ve asked them to be your fake date to your brother\u2019s birthday party. That sort of being an idiot to someone. Hypothetically.\u201d\n\u201cHypothetically,\u201d Jin Zixuan says flatly, after a long and extremely judgmental silence.\n\u201cHypothetically, yes.\u201d\n\u201cHypothetically \u2013 no, I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t do this. You\u2019re telling me that Wei Wuxian \u2013 Wei Wuxian, professional chaos gremlin \u2013 is a fucking single father?\u201d\nLan Wangji winces. \u201cHe\u2026 adopted a child? Who is four? Which is why he\u2019s not enrolled this year?\u201d\n\u201cHe what?\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\nLan Wangji makes a tortured noise and slides down the couch a little. \u201cHe adopted a child, Jin Zixuan. A small, adorable orphan who had nowhere else to go. He just\u2026 adopted him, and is now a father.\u201d\n\u201cWangji,\u201d says Jin Zixuan, \u201cI\u2019ve always said you have a weird domesticity kink for a guy who never actually dates, but for fuck\u2019s sake.\u201d\n\u201cDo not,\u201d says Lan Wangji, \u201ckinkshame me in my hour of need.\u201d\n\u201cYour hour of need is directly caused by your stupid kink!\u201d shouts Jin Zixuan. He makes an exasperated noise, then affects the drawling monotone that means he\u2019s pretending to be Lan Wangji. \u201c\u2018Hello, my name is Hanguang-Jun, and I\u2019m attracted to dumbasses and dumbasses exclusively. Yesterday Wei Wuxian told me he adopted an orphan even though he\u2019s a single idiot in his early twenties, and now I dream of kissing him under the moonlight.\u2019 You\u2019re my friend and I love you, Wangji, but \u2013 from the bottom of my heart \u2013 why are you like this?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m an idiot, apparently,\u201d Lan Wangji says, morosely. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise I wanted him, because I didn\u2019t think it was something I could have, but now \u2013\u201d\n\u201cBut now you\u2019re out of the closet \u2013 under unpleasant circumstances, admittedly, but out nonetheless \u2013 \u00a0\u00a0and suddenly you want to date Wei Wuxian? Really date him, not just fake date him?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026 yes?\u201d says Lan Wangji, who somehow hadn\u2019t got as far as phrasing it so succinctly in his own head. Just the concept makes his skin prickle. \u201cYes. I do want that.\u201d\n\u201cWhy,\u201d says Jin Zixuan, plaintively. And then, when Lan Wangji opens his mouth to answer, \u201cThat was fucking rhetorical, don\u2019t you dare explain.\u201d He takes an audible breath and says, more gently, \u201cWangji. I hate to ask this, because it involves thinking about the inside of Wei Wuxian\u2019s brain, but what\u2019s the likelihood of him reciprocating, here? I mean, I\u2019m not trying to be harsh, but he has met you.\u201d\n\u00a0Lan Wangji lets this pass without comment, aware that it\u2019s justified payback for calling Jin Zixuan experienced with idiocy, and feels his ears grow hot. \u201cWell. If nothing else, we are definitely, ah\u2026 sexually compatible.\u201d\nThe sound of something being knocked over bursts through his phone speaker. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d says Jin Zixuan, faintly. \u201cCould you repeat that? I think I just had a stroke.\u201d\nLan Wangji presses his face into the couch cushions. \u201cWe had sex. Today. Earlier. It was \u2013 extremely good.\u201d\n\u201cTell me one more detail about the sex itself, and I will literally murder you. What the fuck, Wangji? Talk about burying the fucking lede \u2013 how and why did you end up boning him?\u201d\n\u201cWe thought\u2026 kissing practice, for the party. So we\u2019d know how much physical intimacy we were comfortable with. It\u2026 escalated.\u201d\n\u201cIt escalated.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cIt escalated into sex.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cAnd he still wants to come to the birthday party?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d And then, because this is a somewhat salient detail, \u201cHe\u2019s bringing his son, too. We realized his siblings will be there, and they want to see their nephew.\u201d\n\u201cAnd he\u2019s still going be your fake date, even though it means pretending to both families?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cAnd yet,\u201d says Jin Zixuan, in somewhat strangled tones, \u201cyou still decided to call me \u2013 me \u2013 and ask about what happens next, because you weren\u2019t sure what your own feelings were, and you\u2019re not sure if he feels the same?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re both complete fucking idiots,\u201d says Jin Zixuan, and hangs up in disgust.\nOn Thursday morning, Lan Wangji wakes to find he\u2019s received a text from Wei Wuxian, timestamped a little after 1am, that reads, I think I owe you an apology. Are you free to meet today?\nAnxiety swirls through his stomach. What if Wei Wuxian has changed his mind about the party? What if yesterday was a mistake, and he no longer wants to be around Lan Wangji? Forgetting the fact that it\u2019s 5am and Wei Wuxian, who is very much a night-owl to Lan Wangji\u2019s lark, will likely still be fast asleep, Lan Wangji instantly texts him back: I don\u2019t need to be on campus until 2pm. Please call or come by whenever you wish before then. He considers sending a second message stating that Wei Wuxian has nothing to apologise for, but ultimately decides against it: if Wei Wuxian wants to have whatever conversation this turns out to be in person, then Lan Wangji won\u2019t push his boundaries.\nWith potentially hours to go before he receives a response, Lan Wangji goes through his usual morning rituals in a state of increasing tension. Meditation and running both help a little, but once he\u2019s out of the shower and dressed, he can\u2019t stop checking his phone. He is therefore both surprised and relieved when an answering string of texts comes through a little after 7.30, just as he\u2019s finishing a later-than-usual breakfast:\nWei Ying: oh thank god THANK U\nWei Ying: honestly wasn\u2019t sure you\u2019d reply\nWei Ying: I can be there in forty minutes if that\u2019s okay??\nThat works for me, Lan Wangji texts back, and then has a small crisis about the fact that, as he hasn\u2019t yet done any laundry, he won\u2019t be able to return Wei Wuxian\u2019s panties to him. Ears burning, he hurries to empty his nearly-full hamper into the machine, putting in the detergent and selecting his usual settings on autopilot. The machine starts to fill, and only then does he realize that he could\u2019ve just put the soiled panties in a bag; that Wei Wuxian probably didn\u2019t expect him to return the damn things laundered, assuming he even realizes they\u2019re missing. He then has an additional panic about the fact that the panties are made of a different material to just about everything he owns, and what if his regular laundry settings leave them damaged? He should\u2019ve taken them out and checked if they needed hand-washing or warm water, not just tossed them in with his regular load!\nIf they\u2019re ruined, I\u2019ll buy him a new pair, he thinks, and then has to sit down and take some deep, calming breaths at the prospect of buying lingerie for Wei Wuxian, which \u2013 how would that even work? Presumably there are specialty stores that make such items to fit traditionally male bodies, but Lan Wangji has never actually shopped at one before. Will he need Wei Wuxian\u2019s measurements? Will he have to go in person? Every potential outcome is both more arousing-slash-mortifying than the last. Lan Wangji groans and puts his head in his hands. Jin Zixuan was right. Why am I like this?\nAfter thirty-five minutes of self-flagellating introspection, the washing cycle finishes. Lan Wangji moves instinctively to put everything in the dryer when he remembers the panties will almost certainly need a different setting to his own clothes, and is about to try and fish them out in the hopes of finding care instructions on the label when the doorbell rings.\nLan Wangji jerks upright in front of the washer as if he\u2019s been caught doing something illicit. Taking a deep breath, he schools his face to calmness and goes to answer the door, where he finds an agitated and visibly tired Wei Wuxian, a jittery smile on his face and an extremely large cup of coffee in his hand.\n\u201cHi,\u201d says Wei Wuxian, flashing a nervous look as he steps into the hallway. Lan Wangji shuts the door, heart pounding all out of proportion to the context.\n\u201cWhat \u2013 what did you want to talk about?\u201d he asks, trying very hard not to stare at the extremely visible hickey on Wei Wuxian\u2019s neck.\nWei Wuxian flushes, fiddling with his coffee cup while failing to make consistent eye contact. \u201cRight. So, about yesterday? I just, I know we\u2019re both consenting adults, and it\u2019s not like I took advantage of you, exactly, but I also kind of\u2026 jumped you, a bit \u2013 jumped on you, really \u2013 and that ended up, uh, escalating things, which was not what we\u2019d agreed to, and the thing is \u2013\u201d he visibly forces himself to look up, biting his lip in a way that makes Lan Wangji want to push him against the wall and bite it for him, \u201c\u2013 the thing is, I wanted to say sorry. Like, not sorry like I regret being sexual with you, specifically, but sorry like I made things sexual in a way you probably felt really awkward about afterwards, once the hormones wore off and you had time to process it. And I know it\u2019s not, like, an excuse, but ever since I adopted A-Yuan, I haven\u2019t exactly had a lot of time for, uh, relations of any kind, never mind the fact that he\u2019s sleeping in my bed most nights, but I wanted you to know that I\u2019m not going to be like that on Sunday. I can actually control myself around you, Lan Zhan! And that\u2019s. That\u2019s what I wanted to say.\u201d\n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d says Lan Wangji, after he takes a moment to process all this. \u201cYou don\u2019t owe me an apology. I \u2013\u201d he falters, fighting the urge to duck his head, and somehow manages to admit, \u201c\u2013 I didn\u2019t feel awkward afterwards. I just wished you\u2019d been able to stay.\u201d\nWei Wuxian\u2019s mouth forms a soft O of surprise. Hesitantly, he says, \u201cI wish I\u2019d been able to stay, too.\u201d\n\u201cMn,\u201d says Lan Wangji, stomach twisting as a shy, soft smile creeps onto Wei Wuxian\u2019s face \u2013 and then he ruins it by blurting out, \u201cYou left your panties here.\u201d\nWei Wuxian goes bright red. \u201cOh my god, I\u2019m so sorry \u2013\u201d\n\u201cI washed them,\u201d Lan Wangji says, ears burning as his mouth runs away from his brain, oh god, why can\u2019t he stop talking, \u201cjust now. But I wasn\u2019t sure what dryer setting to use.\u201d\nWei Wuxian cycles through several sets of facial expressions at lightning speed before \u2013 mercifully, beautifully \u2013 bursting into laughter. \u201cLan Zhan!\u201d he wheezes, almost doubled over, \u201conly you would be worried about which dryer setting to use!\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to ruin them,\u201d Lan Wangji says, helplessly. \u201cThey\u2019re so pretty.\u201d\nThe laughter stops as abruptly as it started; Wei Wuxian jerks upright, a speculative light coming into his eyes. \u201cYeah?\u201d he asks, mouth quirking slyly. \u201cYou liked my pretty panties, Lan Zhan?\u201d\nLan Wangji swallows hard. His ears are on fire. \u201cYes,\u201d he says.\n\u201cI have\u2026 other pairs.\u201d Wei Wuxian steps incrementally closer, looking up through his lashes in a way that is no less electrifyingly hot for being, on this occasion, clearly deliberate. \u201cI could wear some on Sunday.\u201d\nPlease do, Lan Wangji thinks, but somehow wrangles enough self-control to say instead, \u201cThey were part of the outfit.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cHmm,\u201d says Wei Wuxian. He grins, head tilted gently onside. \u201cMaybe I will, then.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe?\u201d\n\u201cIt can be a surprise,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, the tiniest bit of hesitation creeping into his tone. \u201cFor \u2013 for afterwards, I mean, I was serious about the whole not-jumping-you-at-the-party thing, but \u2013\u201d\n\u201cDoes that mean,\u201d says Lan Wangji carefully, \u201cthat you might be amenable to some, ah\u2026 subsequent jumping?\u201d He takes a steadying breath and steps a little closer. \u201cOr to being jumped?\u201d\nWei Wuxian mouths the phrase subsequent jumping to himself, then inhales sharply, meeting Lan Wangji\u2019s gaze as he realizes what\u2019s being offered. \u201cYes to both,\u201d he says, shakily. \u201cLan Zhan \u2013\u201d\nLan Wangji cups the curve of his jaw and kisses him, soft and gentle. Wei Wuxian gasps against his mouth, and there\u2019s an exquisite moment where it would be so easy to deepen things, but Lan Wangji forces himself to pull back instead. He knows he\u2019s smiling, and sees the moment when Wei Wuxian sees it, too, a bright grin blooming across his face in answer.\n\u201cWell, then,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cWell, I can\u2019t \u2013 I can\u2019t actually stay, I had to leave A-Yuan with my neighbour, but I think \u2013 we\u2019re good, right? This is good?\u201d\n\u201cWe are,\u201d says Lan Wangji, swallowing. \u201cWei Ying is good. For Sunday and for \u2013 other things.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d Wei Wuxian breathes. \u201cGood, then. That\u2019s \u2013 good.\u201d He motions awkwardly towards the door, still smiling broadly. \u201cSo, I\u2019ll just go now, but \u2013 Sunday?\u201d\n\u201cSunday.\u201d\n\u201cSunday,\u201d Wei Wuxian promises, and then he\u2019s fumbling his way out backwards, almost tripping over the doorframe and dropping his coffee in the same instant. Lan Wangji lunges to help him, but he rights himself at the last second, his grin taking on a manic quality as he bounces upright and declares, \u201cIt\u2019s fine! I styled it out, I\u2019m fine, goodbye!\u201d and not-quite-running away.\nIt\u2019s not until he shuts the door that Lan Wangji realizes he\u2019s still in possession of Wei Wuxian\u2019s red panties \u2013 but this time, the thought doesn\u2019t fill him with anxiety. Stomach swooping, he returns to his half-done laundry and puts the panties in the dryer with the rest of his things.\nIf they do end up ruined, he reasons, he can always buy another pair.\nLan Wangji spends the next two and a half days in a state of nervous anticipation. Not wanting to stay completely out of contact with Wei Wuxian, he summons his courage and texts him a picture of a rabbit he sees on his way to campus on Thursday afternoon, and is rewarded, first by a string of heart-eyed emojis, and then by a series of random messages, seemingly about whatever is on Wei Wuxian\u2019s mind at the time. Mostly, what\u2019s on his mind is A-Yuan, and Lan Wangji finds himself smiling fondly whenever he opens his texts.\nOn Saturday morning, he steps out of the shower, checks his phone and finds a new string of messages:\nWei Ying: A-Yuan just asked me to make his congee spicy, CLEARLY he is my son who I birthed from my very own body\nWei Ying: oh god I made it too spicy for him now he\u2019s crying WHO LET ME HAVE A CHILD I KNOW NOTHING\nWei Ying: it\u2019s gremlin hours in the wei household now we\u2019re both eating donuts for breakfast I will not be accepting criticism at this time\nThis third text is paired with a photo of A-Yuan and Wei Wuxian, the former still a little red-eyed but nonetheless grinning triumphantly around a mouthful of donut, the latter rolling his eyes with half a donut hanging out of his mouth like a sugary, broken cigar. Lan Wangji huffs a laugh and texts him back:\nLan Wangji: Please make sure to have a healthy, balanced lunch.\nWei Ying: donuts are a vegetable\nWearing nothing but a towel around his hips, Lan Wangji walks to his fridge, opens the crisper and snaps a photo of the leeks, spring onions, bok choy, turnips and beansprouts arranged carefully therein. He sends it to Wei Wuxian along with a frowning emoji, shuts the fridge and then leans his hip against the counter, lips quirked as he watches the typing bubble flicker.\nWei Ying: TURNIPS???\nWei Ying: the BETRAYAL\nWei Ying: its like I dont even know you\nLan Wangji: I\u2019m a man of hidden depths.\nWei Ying: \u2026was that a joke?? You joke now??\nLan Wangji: I dabble.\nFor that, he receives a keysmash and a string of crylaughing emojis. He doesn\u2019t know how to reply to that, and so says nothing until Wei Wuxian texts him again hours later, at lunchtime: a photo of A-Yuan happily eating a selection of vegetables, none of which are turnips.\nAside from texting with Wei Wuxian, Lan Wangji spends the rest of the day either on the phone with Xichen or helping him to confirm various last-minute details for the party. Originally, he was meant to have been far more involved in the preparations, but after the argument with Lan Qiren, Xichen had gently insisted on taking over. It had made Lan Wangji\u2019s stomach twist with guilt and frustration, but the only alternative was remaining in regular contact with his uncle, and that\u2026 was still untenable. Will possibly always be untenable in a way that makes Lan Wangji\u2019s heart hurt if he thinks about it too much, and so he shoves those thoughts aside and focusses on double-checking orders with vendors and fielding Xichen\u2019s questions, rereading his messages with Wei Wuxian whenever he needs a pick-me-up.\nHis final errand for the day involves a trip to the shops, to make a purchase he\u2019s spent the last two days researching online. His pulse ticks up a bit as he pays for it, but the cashier just gives him a friendly, customer-service smile and asks if he wants a bag. Lan Wangji declines and carries the box out to the car, where he sets it carefully in the back seat. He plans to read the instruction manual thoroughly before tackling the installation, though hopefully it won\u2019t be too dark by then.\nOn Sunday morning, he wakes at his usual 5am and goes through his usual routine, though for once, he has to actively coach himself not to rush. The party doesn\u2019t officially start until 11am, though Lan Wangji is expected to be there an hour earlier to help set up, and as they\u2019ll be driving to Cloud Recesses rather than taking the train \u2013 he wants the option to leave immediately, should the need arise \u2013 Wei Wuxian has agreed to bring A-Yuan over at around 8. Though his mornings are normally a time of peace and mental clarity, today, he finds himself resenting how the hours drag. He takes an extra-long shower to help pass the time (and to sneak in an orgasm; he doesn\u2019t want to be even more keyed up all day than he already is) and then spends an inordinate amount of time staring at his wardrobe, wondering what on earth to wear.\nOrdinarily, he wouldn\u2019t put so much thought into his clothing choices. He has plenty of smart causal, business casual and formalwear options, knows exactly what he\u2019d be wearing if he\u2019d never quarreled with his uncle, but knowing he\u2019ll be going with Wei Wuxian \u2013 knowing what Wei Wuxian will be wearing \u2013 lends the whole thing a sudden air of significance. He can\u2019t look too buttoned-up, not when his date is wearing a saucy crop-top \u2013 or will the effect be somehow magnified, if Lan Wangji shows up dressed like he\u2019s going for a job interview? No, no; that feels too much like using Wei Wuxian as a prop. Lan Wangji needs to dress down, not up. Should he try and match colours with Wei Wuxian? He doesn\u2019t own a lot of red, but he has some black, and that looks good enough with the blues and creams that constitute the bulk of his wardrobe. But most of his black clothes are formal, and he\u2019s trying to loosen up\u2026\nIn the end, he settles on a pair of pale blue jeans, somewhat more fitted than he\u2019d usually wear \u2013 they\u2019ve been in his closet since his first undergraduate year, and he\u2019s put on more muscle since then \u2013 and a charcoal grey tee, likewise formfitting, with a pair of rabbits where the breast pocket would go, if t-shirts had breast pockets. One rabbit is white, the other black, curled together in an approximated yin-yang shape. They\u2019re the whole reason he impulse-bought the shirt, though at the time, he\u2019d been too embarrassed to wear it outside of the house. Now, though, it feels perfect, and after brushing his freshly-dried hair to a shine, he puts on socks and sets the shoes he\u2019s planning to wear by the front door, ready to go.\nAt 8.15, just as Lan Wangji is starting to fret that Wei Wuxian has changed his mind, the bell rings. He smiles as he opens it, and there\u2019s Wei Wuxian, smiling in turn, a beaming A-Yuan by his side.\n\u201cHi, rich-gege!\u201d says A-Yuan, bouncing slightly. He\u2019s wearing a pale purple tee patterned with lotus flowers and a pair of dark green corduroy pants. \u201cWe\u2019re going a party!\u201d\n\u201cYes, we are,\u201d says Lan Wangji.\n\u201cSorry we\u2019re running a bit late,\u201d says Wei Wuxian. \u201cA-Yuan wanted to wear the shirt that shijie bought him, but it was hiding down the back of the drawer, so we had to get a later bus than planned.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re barely late at all. We\u2019ve still got plenty of time,\u201d says Lan Wangji, allowing himself to drink in Wei Wuxian\u2019s appearance. As promised, he\u2019s wearing the same black jeans and red SAVE A SWORD, RIDE A SOCIALIST shirt as the other day, though he\u2019s also accessorized with a pair of red and black drop earrings and a necklace that Lan Wangji half recognizes. It\u2019s a long black cord, doubled in two snug loops around Wei Wuxian\u2019s pale throat, so that the third loop, bearing a small wooden flute charm, dangles against his chest. Lan Wangji blinks at it, wondering why on earth a piece of Wei Wuxian\u2019s jewelry should look familiar to him, until it suddenly clicks.\n\u201cI gave you that,\u201d he says, startled, and without quite meaning to, he reaches out to touch it, a gentle fingertip tap to the wooden flute.\nWei Wuxian\u2019s eyes go wide. \u201cIt was you?\u201d\nLan Wangji feels his ears go hot. In their first year of university, their classmate Nie Huaisang had decided to throw a party where every guest would be randomly given the name of a different guest, for whom they would then have to buy a present. No giver could identify themselves to the giftee, he said, as anonymity was the point, with everyone having to adhere to a set price limit for their purchase. He called it Sang\u2019s Secret, and it had caught on among their extended circle of friends, becoming an annual event. Two years ago, Lan Wangji had drawn Wei Wuxian\u2019s name, and after weeks of frustrated searching had finally found the necklace at a market stall. He knew Wei Wuxian had liked the gift \u2013 he\u2019d spent a not considerable portion of the party pestering various people about who his giver had been \u2013 but although he\u2019s seen him wear it since, the last time was a while ago.\n\u201cIt was,\u201d he says, mouth a little dry. \u201cI\u2019m glad you liked it.\u201d\nWei Wuxian laughs, two spots of colour on his cheeks. \u201cIt\u2019s my favourite.\u201d\nThey stare at each other, smiling stupidly, and are saved from silence by A-Yuan, who tugs firmly on Wei Wuxian\u2019s hand and asks, \u201cNow we go to the party?\u201d\nLan Wangji coughs. \u201cJust let me get my things,\u201d he says. Xichen\u2019s gift is already sitting wrapped on the hall table, and once he\u2019s put on his shoes, he tucks it neatly under his arm, pockets his phone and wallet, and joins Wei Wuxian and A-Yuan for the walk down to his car.\nThey\u2019re within sight of the road when Wei Wuxian suddenly stops dead, a groan emitting from his lips.\n\u201cOh, no,\u201d he says. \u201cLan Zhan, I\u2019m such an idiot, I\u2019m so sorry, I didn\u2019t think \u2013\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t bring A-Yuan\u2019s car seat.\u201d He looks genuinely mortified, an expression Lan Wangji has never seen \u2013 nor, indeed, ever expected to see \u2013 on Wei Wuxian\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I keep his seat in the hall cupboard because we don\u2019t have a car, but we caught the bus over today and I just didn\u2019t think \u2013 I knew I needed to bring it, but we were running late, so we ran out the door \u2013 I can\u2019t believe I just forgot it, I\u2019m so \u2013\u201d\n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d says Lan Wangji, interrupting gently. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. I already have one.\u201d\n\u201c\u2013 but we can\u2019t go without a \u2013 what?\u201d His mouth falls open. \u201cYou \u2013 what?\u201d\n\u201cI already have a car seat.\u201d He gestures towards his car, walking closer so that, when Wei Wuxian finally follows, he can see it for himself.\nWei Wuxian stares at him, throat working as he swallows. \u201cLan Zhan, why do you have a car seat?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I bought one,\u201d says Lan Wangji. \u201cYesterday. For you. For A-Yuan, I mean,\u201d he says, sparing a glance for the boy in question.\n\u201cNew seat?\u201d asks A-Yuan, standing on tiptoes to peer in through the car window. \u201cGege, I\u2019ve got a new seat! It\u2019s got red! Can I sit in it now? Can I try it?\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d says Lan Wangji, when Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t immediately answer. He unlocks the car, wondering for an awful moment if he\u2019s crossed a line, then steps back, making room for A-Yuan to clamber in and exclaim over how tall he is in the seat, and how much he likes the red stripes.\n\u201cSilly melon, you\u2019re sitting on the buckles,\u201d says Wei Wuxian, belatedly bending down to lift them out from under him. \u201cNow, before I fasten you in, last chance \u2013 do you need to use the restroom?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine,\u201d says A-Yuan. Wei Wuxian levels him with a skeptical look, but proceeds to buckle him in regardless. Lan Wangji admires his facility with the straps, which he\u2019d found fairly confusing when setting the whole thing up last night, then sidesteps as Wei Wuxian straightens up again, closing the door.\n\u201cYou bought a car seat,\u201d he repeats, an unreadable look on his face. \u201cYou bought a whole car seat, just for one trip.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nLan Wangji swallows hard. \u201cIt\u2026 seemed like the right thing to do.\u201d And I don\u2019t want it to be just one trip.\nWei Wuxian stares a moment longer; then he smiles, bright and beautiful. \u201cLan Zhan, you\u2019re truly ridiculous. Has anyone ever told you that?\u201d\n\u201cThey have now,\u201d he says, and feels his heart flip at the sound of Wei Wuxian\u2019s laughter.\nLan Wangji doesn\u2019t have much experience with small children, and is therefore ill-equipped to judge whether A-Yuan is representative of his age range, generally speaking, or if he\u2019s somehow ahead of the curve. Either way, it doesn\u2019t take long for him to feel a slow, dawning joy at the realisation that he likes A-Yuan, who has a lively, curious mind and a cheerful disposition. Once he calms down a little from the excitement of the new car seat, A-Yuan instantly starts asking questions: whose party are they going to? Is Xichen rich-gege\u2019s da-ge or his didi? Does he have any sisters? Any other brothers? (A-Yuan wishes he had three brothers and two sisters.) Will there be other children? Will there be games to play?\nLan Wangji isn\u2019t sure what games might be on offer \u2013 he hadn\u2019t asked Xichen about this particular detail, assuming that small children would instinctively make their own fun \u2013 but he assures A-Yuan that, if he ever gets bored, there\u2019s a meadow full of rabbits that he can visit, provided he can be gentle. A-Yuan is thrilled at the prospect, and proceeds to ask dozens of new questions: what colour are the rabbits? Are they nice? Are there babies? Are there other animals at Cloud Recesses? (A-Yuan\u2019s favourite animals are cats and rabbits, because they are cute and soft.) Has rich-gege ever had a cat? \u00a0\nExcept for occasional pauses, the questions are more or less constant. After the first twenty minutes, Wei Wuxian shoots Lan Wangji an apologetic look from the front passenger seat and murmurs, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to answer everything he asks, you know.\u201d\nLan Wangji blinks at him, surprised. \u201cBut I want to,\u201d he says. Truthfully, Lan Wangji has always felt more at ease answering questions than venturing his own opinions, especially regarding factual rather than personal matters. It\u2019s taken him years of practice to reach a point where he can easily converse with Jin Zixuan and a handful of other people, and he feels a little frisson to realise that Wei Wuxian was among the first of these. But then, Wei Wuxian has always been easy to talk to: he sometimes teases, yes, but he doesn\u2019t judge, and he\u2019s always happy to carry a conversation without making his interlocutor feel like a burden.\nWei Wuxian laughs, a fond smile on his face. \u201cWell, just let me know if you need to tap out. He can keep it up for hours.\u201d\nIn the end, this turns out to be a slight exaggeration: A-Yuan keeps up his questions for a full hour, the pauses between them getting a little longer each time, until he abruptly falls asleep, one chubby cheek resting against the edge of the car seat.\n\u201cGood job tiring him out!\u201d says Wei Wuxian, after twisting around to establish that A-Yuan really is out for the count. \u201cHonestly, thanks for indulging him. I try my best, but it gets a lot more exhausting when you\u2019re doing it solo, 24-7.\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t indulgence,\u201d Lan Wangji says. \u201cI enjoyed it.\u201d He hesitates, not sure how to put it into words. \u201cAs a child, I was not encouraged to ask questions. I was taught to listen to my elders and to answer whatever they asked me about my studies; asking additional queries would have implied that I didn\u2019t trust them to teach me properly. I still learned a great deal, but not about conversation, and I have always found it difficult since to ask for things. It\u2026 delights me, to meet a curious child; to see how clearly he wants to learn, and to know I can help to teach him.\u201d\nWei Wuxian flushes, chuckling as he ducks his head. \u201cIt gets a little less endearing when you\u2019re answering the same question for the fourteenth time, but \u2013 yes. It\u2019s nice to help him learn.\u201d\nLan Wangji considers this. \u201cRepetition is part of learning,\u201d he says. \u201cCertainly, it can be frustrating to feel you aren\u2019t being listened to \u2013\u201d he thinks of his History of Cultivation students, \u201c\u2013 but it is still part of the process.\u201d Then he frowns, though only at himself. \u201cI apologise. I didn\u2019t mean to lecture you. This is your area of expertise, not mine.\u201d\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t lecturing,\u201d says Wei Wuxian. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 nice, actually, to have someone assume that I know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cWhy would anyone assume otherwise? A-Yuan is clearly flourishing.\u201d\nWei Wuxian lets out a strangled laugh. \u201cLan Zhan, Lan Zhan. You truly are too good.\u201d\nCheeks burning, Lan Wangji says, \u201cI am merely myself.\u201d\n\u201cModest, too,\u201d says Wei Wuxian, but grins to show he\u2019s teasing. He tucks a stray strand of hair behind his ear, then says, in a softer voice, \u201cAt any rate, it\u2019s good to practice with easy questions now. One day, A-Yuan will be old enough to ask what happened to his original family, and that will be much harder to answer. I\u2019m hoping that by then, I\u2019ll know how to explain it properly.\u201d\nLan Wangji glances in the rearview mirror, throat growing tight at the sight of A-Yuan, peacefully asleep with his mouth open. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me, but\u2026 what did happen?\u201d\nWei Wuxian sighs. \u201cYou deserve to know, if only because there\u2019s an outside chance that it might come up at the party. A-Yuan was born into the Wen clan, one of the cadet branches. Most of that part of the family are doctors, and his parents both served as medical staff in one of the Qishan mining communities. It was an older mine \u2013 old equipment, old gear. He was only a few months old when something went wrong in one of the shafts. His parents went in to help the wounded, but there was a secondary collapse, and they both died. The surviving miners did their best to look after him, but there were more accidents, and Wen Ruohan kept refusing to improve the safety conditions. You remember Wen Qing and Wen Ning, from our indoctrination year at Cloud Recesses?\u201d\n\u201cI do,\u201d says Lan Wangji. He hadn\u2019t paid them much attention at the time \u2013 he\u2019d been too busy furiously obsessing over Wei Wuxian \u2013 but they\u2019ve remained in the periphery of his awareness ever since despite attending a different university, if only because they\u2019re still his agemates in the cultivation world.\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve been friends with them since then,\u201d says Wei Wuxian, \u201cand when the miners started protesting, Wen Qing got involved. And, well, you know me \u2013 if there\u2019s a protest happening, I\u2019m going to be a part of it, so I ended up tagging along, which is how I first met A-Yuan, back when he\u2019d just turned one. This would\u2019ve been, uh \u2013 fuck, I suck at maths \u2013 our second year of university? Yeah.\u201d He shakes his head, grinning ruefully. \u201cAnyway. You probably don\u2019t need me to tell you that Wen Ruohan is a great big bag of dicks, but just in case: he\u2019s a great big bag of dicks who doesn\u2019t give a shit about worker safety in the mines his company owns, even when the people getting hurt are technically part of his clan. And he really does not like his policies being protested.\n\u201cLong story short, it\u2019s three years later and shit still hasn\u2019t been fixed. The miners have been lobbying for change pretty consistently, but they\u2019re a small community, isolated, and it\u2019s only now that people elsewhere have started to take notice. Which means Wen Ruohan\u2019s people have started cracking down on their unions, lots of shady retaliatory stuff \u2013 including violence, though of course it all gets written up internally as \u2018random muggings\u2019 or whatever.\u201d He makes a disgusted face. \u201cLate last year, it started getting bad enough that Fourth Uncle and the others were worried about A-Yuan; about what would happen to him in the future if anything happens to them. And the area where they\u2019re living, there\u2019s really only one local school \u2013 not a lot of resources or opportunities \u2013 but for the miners, it\u2019s their livelihood, their ancestral land. They want to stay and fight to make things better for the future, which is awesome, but they also wanted something better for A-Yuan now, you know? Madam Wen was technically registered as his foster-carer after his parents died, but even though she loves him to death, she\u2019s old, and he just has so much energy. It was getting too much for her, especially with all the other stresses.\n\u201cSo I just thought, why not adopt him myself? I\u2019ve known him since he was a baby, I\u2019m friends with everyone else who cares about him, but I can keep him safe, get him into a better school district. And I love him, you know? He\u2019s easy to love.\u201d He swallows. \u201cThere\u2019s rules about adopting as a single parent, but I inherited a bit of money from my birth family, plus the Jiangs set up a trust for me years ago, just like they did with shijie and Jiang Cheng, so I was considered financially secure enough to be approved. It helped a lot that Wen Qing and Madam Wen and the others all endorsed me for it \u2013 the fact that they trust me not to fuck it up is honestly, like, kind of overwhelming if I think about too much \u2013 but the alternative was A-Yuan going into the foster system and ending up with strangers, and like fuck was I letting that happen.\u201d\n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d says Lan Wangji, overwhelmed by his own feelings. \u201cA-Yuan is lucky to have you.\u201d\nWei Wuxian waves a hand and looks out a window, a fey smile on his lips. \u201cTell me that when he\u2019s all grown up; right now, I feel like I\u2019m learning how to swim in the middle of a flood.\u201d He laughs. \u201cSeriously though, the weirdest part about all of this is realizing how much of being an adult is apparently just making shit up on the fly. You remember being a little kid and thinking that grown-ups always knew what they were doing? Like, obviously you didn\u2019t always like it, but there was this, this sense that even if they were being dumb about kid things, about you, they still had to understand how adult stuff worked, right?\u201d\n\u201cMn,\u201d says Lan Wangji, who in honesty had felt something similar up until just a few weeks ago, when Lan Qiren threw him out of his study.\n\u201cWell, it turns out that\u2019s bullshit,\u201d says Wei Wuxian. \u201cThese last few birthdays, turning twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two, I keep waiting for some sort of switch \u2013\u201d he gestures at the side of his head, miming an up-down motion, \u201c\u2013 like a brain switch for Adult Things to turn on, where suddenly I\u2019d wake up one morning and know how to fill out a tax return without wanting to set my hair on fire, and always remember to put milk on the fucking shopping list instead of thinking each time, oh, obviously I need milk, there\u2019s no need to write it down, then coming back home again without any fucking milk, but like \u2013\u201d\nHe takes a breath, glancing back to check that A-Yuan is still asleep, then continues, a little more quietly, \u201c\u2013 you\u2019d think, if anything was going to make the Adult Things switch turn on, it would be having a kid. But it didn\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t. You\u2019re still just you, still learning things because apparently you never actually stop, only now there\u2019s a tiny person who assumes you know how everything works, and your job is to make them believe it. And it\u2019s terrifying. Wonderful, but terrifying. And A-Yuan is four! That\u2019s way past diapers and bottles and toilet training; he already walks and talks, and he doesn\u2019t have that weird soft spot on his head that babies do. You can drop a four-year-old \u2013 like, not on purpose, obviously, but you can \u2013 and they\u2019ll just kind of giggle and bounce, but you absolutely cannot drop a baby.\u201d He mock-shudders, running a hand through his hair. \u201cFuck, if I\u2019d had to take him when he was any younger than this, I\u2019d be a wreck.\u201d\n\u201cBut you would\u2019ve?\u201d\n\u201cI would\u2019ve. Of course I would\u2019ve.\u201d Wei Wuxian smiles softly. \u201cI love him.\u201d\nLan Wangji swallows and grips the wheel. He can\u2019t believe there was ever a time when he didn\u2019t think the world of Wei Wuxian; when he was so tangled up in his own neuroses that he didn\u2019t see how astonishingly compassionate he is, didn\u2019t understand the depths of his loyalty to the people he cares about. He wants to do something ridiculous, like pull the car onto the hard shoulder and kiss him senseless, or possibly propose marriage. He wants to ask to stay in his life in whatever capacity Wei Wuxian and A-Yuan will have him.\nInstead, he says, with only the barest shake in his voice, \u201cMy uncle was wrong about me, but he was even more wrong about you.\u201d\nWei Wuxian tips his head back and laughs. \u201cIf I traveled through time and tried to tell my fifteen-year-old self what you just said, he wouldn\u2019t believe a word of it! You hated me so much back then, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve finally won you over.\u201d\n\u201cI never hated you,\u201d Lan Wangji says, startled. He forces himself to catch Wei Wuxian\u2019s eye \u2013 albeit briefly, as he is still a responsible driver \u2013 and, seeing his expression of disbelief, says, \u201cTruly. I was\u2026 embarrassingly obsessed with you, often in very aggressive ways, but nothing I felt was even close to hatred.\u201d\n\u201cWait, wait.\u201d Wei Wuxian straightens up, a delighted expression on his face. \u201cYou were embarrassingly obsessed with me? Lan Zhan! Since when? I demand an explanation!\u201d\nFeeling hot all over, Lan Wangji focusses on the road and says, as calmly as he can manage, \u201cYou put explicit gay pornography into the book I was reading. I\u2019d been \u2013 struggling, trying to ignore the signs that other boys interested me in a way that girls did not, and then you made me look at it. You made me look at you, and I was furious about it, because I thought that you\u2019d seen right through me. But even though I reacted, you didn\u2019t seem to care \u2013 not about that, at least \u2013 and I wanted, I wanted nothing more than to pin you down and make you explain yourself, but I wasn\u2019t brave enough.\u201d He takes a deep breath, allows himself another glance at Wei Wuxian\u2019s beautiful, astonished face, and says, \u201cAll those times I started fights, I wanted you to finish them. I wanted you to take the step that I couldn\u2019t, so that then I\u2019d have an excuse to take it further.\u201d\nWei Wuxian is silent for several long seconds. \u201cAre you seriously telling me,\u201d he says, slowly, \u201cthat the whole time I was fantasizing about you bending me over a library table, you were fantasizing about \u2013\u201d\n\u201c\u2013 bending you over a library table?\u201d Lan Wangji says, wry and embarrassed all at once. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cOh my god.\u201d Wei Wuxian makes a sound that\u2019s half laugh, half groan and slouches dramatically in his seat. \u201cLan Zhan, you don\u2019t even know \u2013 I got that porn from Nie Huaisang, and it was the first time I\u2019d seen anything gay like that, either!\u201d\nLan Wangji cuts him a disbelieving glance. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have the internet at Lotus Pier?\u201d\n\u201cOf course we did! But you think I was going to risk Jiang Cheng walking in on me? I didn\u2019t even look up straight porn at home, let alone anything more adventurous! But Nie Huaisang had that magazine, and I hadn\u2019t known you could like girls and boys until he showed it to me \u2013 it was a bi magazine, it had something for everyone \u2013 but as soon as I saw that picture, I wanted to show it to you. I didn\u2019t even really understand why, at first, but I still did it anyway; it wasn\u2019t until afterwards that I realized I\u2019d been bugging you so much because you were hot, and after that, I kept on trying to get you to reenact it with me.\u201d\n\u201cA jointly formative experience, then,\u201d says Lan Wangji, faintly.\n\u201cApparently so,\u201d says Wei Wuxian.\nWith perfect ironic timing, they pass a road sign stating how many kilometers away Cloud Recesses is, and Lan Wangji almost chokes at the belated realization that they\u2019ll soon be arriving at the place where they first met; the site of their respective (yet apparently mutual, intrinsically linked) gay awakenings. I could ask Xichen for the library key, Lan Wangji thinks, then promptly slaps the thought away like he would a mosquito. No. We\u2019re here to celebrate Xichen\u2019s birthday, and \u2013 with his blessing \u2013 to send a message to Uncle. Not to belatedly enact any teenage sexual fantasies either in, near or in any way relating to the library, or any other part of Cloud Recesses, for that matter. \u00a0\u00a0\nFrom the back seat, A-Yuan makes a sleepy noise, half-lifting his head from the seat. \u201cBunnies yet?\u201d he asks blearily.\n\u201cNot yet, b\u01ceob\u01ceo,\u201d Wei Wuxian says gently. \u201cBunnies later.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d A-Yuan mumbles, and falls straight back to sleep, blissfully oblivious to all else.\nBy the time they reach Cloud Recesses, A-Yuan is awake again, eagerly pushing against his restraints as Lan Wangji drives slowly up the narrow, winding mountain road to the compound.\n\u201cI still can\u2019t believe we all had to walk up the steps for the indoctrination camp,\u201d Wei Wuxian mutters. \u201cIt was like, three thousand steps. One step for every ancient GusuLan rule.\u201d\n\u201cUncle thought it would build character,\u201d says Lan Wangji. His lips quirk. \u201cUnfortunately, he did not specify which type of character.\u201d\n\u201cBunnies!\u201d says A-Yuan, shouting over Wei Wuxian\u2019s snort of laughter. \u201cCan we see the bunnies? I want to see the bunnies first!\u201d\n\u201cB\u01ceob\u01ceo, I promise we\u2019ll see the bunnies, but not right away, okay?\u201d Wei Wuxian turns in his seat, reaching out to pat A-Yuan\u2019s knee. \u201cLan Zhan has to help his brother first.\u201d\n\u201cBut I want to see the bunnies!\u201d\n\u201cI know, and you will. But you have to be good and wait. Can you be a good boy?\u201d\n\u201cBut I\u2019ve been good,\u201d A-Yuan wails. \u201cCan\u2019t I see the bunnies please?\u201d\n\u201cJust be good a little longer. Can you do that?\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d says A-Yuan. He thrashes against his restraints, bucking hard enough that the car seat moves in place. \u201cI want to get up!\u201d\n\u201cI know, b\u01ceob\u01ceo. You\u2019ve been really good for a long drive, but we\u2019re nearly there, okay?\u201d Wei Wuxian leans closer to A-Yuan, pitching his voice to a conspiratorial register. \u201cIf you can be patient, I\u2019ll do airplane with you later.\u201d\nA-Yuan immediately sits bolt upright. \u201cAirplane! Airplane!\u201d\n\u201cJust a few minutes more, okay?\u201d\nA-Yuan nods, hands clasped firmly in his lap. Wei Wuxian watches him a moment longer, then turns back to Lan Wangji with a sigh. \u201cWhen I wake up tomorrow and my arms don\u2019t work, remind me that this is why.\u201d\n\u201cI will,\u201d says Lan Wangji, although he has no idea what airplane is in this context and is frankly too distracted by the assumption that he\u2019ll be seeing Wei Wuxian first thing in the morning to ask.\nThough A-Yuan fidgets a little more, he remains otherwise well-behaved as they finish their drive and, at long last, pull into the flat parking lot cut into the mountainside. A-Yuan cheers as Wei Wuxian unbuckles him, swinging delightedly from his hand as, led by Lan Wangji, they cross the gravel to the switchbacking ramp that leads up into the compound.\n\u201cAir-plane! Air-plane!\u201d chants A-Yuan, giggling delightedly. He\u2019s unapologetically loud, and Lan Wangji has a sudden impulse to shush him \u2013 an impulse born from years and years of being shushed himself, taught always to be quiet within Cloud Recesses, to lower his voice and act with decorum. He swallows it, and embraces A-Yuan\u2019s joy instead \u2013 and then, when he realizes it\u2019s not only allowed, but expected under the circumstances, he carefully transfers Xichen\u2019s gift to his right hand in order to grasp Wei Wuxian\u2019s free hand with his left, squeezing gently.\nWei Wuxian\u2019s eyes go wide for all of a second: then he smiles, bright and beautiful, and laces their fingers together. Impishly, he leans across and kisses Lan Wangji on the cheek. \u201cYou ready?\u201d he murmurs.\n\u201cNo,\u201d says Lan Wangji, flustered into honesty, and then they\u2019re passing beneath an arch of silver, white and blue balloons that\u2019s been set at the top of the ramp, entering Cloud Recesses proper.\nThey\u2019ve barely made it three strides into the courtyard when Xichen emerges from the main building, smiling broadly. He\u2019s dressed in a pale blue suit and crisp white shirt with a mandarin collar, his short hair neatly gelled and combed. \u201cWangji!\u201d he exclaims, striding over. His eyes widen a little as he takes in the sight of Wei Wuxian and A-Yuan, but only for a moment; then they crinkle warmly again, and Lan Wangji feels a rush of affection as he lets go of Wei Wuxian\u2019s hand and embraces his brother.\n\u201cXichen,\u201d he says, voice muffled against his brother\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHappy birthday. It\u2019s good to see you.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, too.\u201d\nThey pull back from each other, and Lan Wangji hands over the present. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to open it now,\u201d he says, \u201cbut you can, if you wish.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll consider it,\u201d says Xichen, eyes twinkling. With that, he turns his gaze to his other guests, the corner of his mouth flicking up in a smile. \u201cWei Wuxian! I\u2019m glad you could come.\u201d And then, to A-Yuan, \u201cAnd who is this?\u201d\n\u201cThis is my son, A-Yuan,\u201d says Wei Wuxian, and when Lan Wangji turns, he\u2019s surprised to find that A-Yuan, who was so boisterous only a moment ago, is clinging firmly to Wei Wuxian\u2019s leg, staring silent and wide-eyed at Xichen. \u201cSorry,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, smiling ruefully. \u201cHe gets a little shy sometimes around new people.\u201d\n\u201cI feel the same way myself,\u201d says Xichen. He winks at A-Yuan, who clings all the tighter to his father, and then turns back to Lan Wangji, his expression turning more serious. \u201cI\u2019ve convinced Uncle to stay in his office until the official start time. I know you\u2019ll see him eventually, but I though it might be nice to prolong the inevitable.\u201d\nLan Wangji nods, throat suddenly tight. \u201cOf course. What do you need help with?\u201d\nXichen laughs, though there\u2019s something almost sad in his expression. \u201cWangji. It\u2019s a catered party. Everything is already set up. There\u2019s plenty of people looking after the details. I asked you to come early so we could see each other, not to make you do chores.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d\nThere\u2019s an awkward silence, broken by a deliberate cough from Wei Wuxian. He grins at the pair of them, gesturing to A-Yuan. \u201cIf you two want to catch up, I can take him to see the waterfall,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ll wander back once the party starts.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d says Lan Wangji, too quickly. \u201cNo, that\u2019s \u2013 I mean.\u201d He takes a breath. \u201cI mean, if you wish to go, I\u2019ll understand, but I would\u2026 I would like you to stay.\u201d\n\u201cOf course you should stay,\u201d says Xichen, though the slight rise of his eyebrow speaks volumes to Lan Wangji. He suppresses a wince: he\u2019d only told Xichen that Wei Wuxian was here as his fake date, but his brother knows him well enough to know from this single exchange that there\u2019s nothing feigned about his feelings.\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Lan Wangji says, glancing carefully at Wei Wuxian, \u201cwe could all go to see the rabbits?\u201d\nA-Yuan\u2019s head jerks up. He stares at Lan Wangji, eyes huge, then looks pleadingly up at Wei Wuxian. \u201cPlease, gege?\u201d\nWei Wuxian gives an exaggerated eyeroll. To Lan Wangji, he says, \u201cYou\u2019ve made me a liar.\u201d And then, to A-Yuan, \u201cAll right, yes. We\u2019ll see the bunnies first.\u201d\nA-Yuan shrieks with delight. Jumping up and down, he tugs on Wei Wuxian\u2019s jeans, chanting, \u201cBunnies! Bunnies! Bunnies!\u201d\nXichen chuckles. \u201cI\u2019ll lead the way, shall I?\u201d\n\u201cPlease do,\u201d says Wei Wuxian, and Lan Wangji is about to explain about the earlier promise of bunnies made while en route, when A-Yuan suddenly flings himself forwards, grappling Lan Wangji around the knees.\n\u201cZhan-ge carry me to the bunnies?\u201d he asks, head tipped all the way back as he grins winningly up at Lan Wangji.\nFor half a second, Lan Wangji is frozen, burningly aware of the astonished looks both his brother and Wei Wuxian are giving him. Then A-Yuan tugs his knees again, and Lan Wangji, who has never carried a child in his life, says, \u201cOf course,\u201d and reaches down to pick him up. A-Yuan laughs and lifts his arms \u2013 he\u2019s both heavier and lighter than Lan Wangji expected, his muscles tensed in preparation for clinging on \u2013 and, after a brief hesitation, settles him on his hip the way he saw Wei Wuxian do at the caf\u00e9. A-Yuan leans against him, gripping his shirt for balance as he bumps his head against Lan Wangji\u2019s shoulder.\n\u201cBunnies!\u201d he says again, cheerfully.\n\u201cBunnies,\u201d Lan Wangji agrees, and breathes a sigh of relief as Xichen starts walking, enabling him to do likewise.\nHe jostles A-Yuan against his hip, settling him more securely, and feels his neck prickle when Wei Wuxian falls into step on his other side. He glances at him, not sure what to make of his expression, and is relieved when he starts to talk.\n\u201cNow, remember, A-Yuan, bunnies get scared easily, so we have to be quiet and gentle, okay?\u201d\n\u201cQuiet and gentle,\u201d A-Yuan echoes, head bumping against Lan Wangji\u2019s ear as he nods. He shifts his hold again \u2013 unlike an inert object, A-Yuan controls his own center of gravity, but is seemingly oblivious to the potential for overbalancing, and keeping him steady requires frequent recalibration. As if to prove this point, A-Yuan promptly leans his whole weight forwards across Lan Wangji\u2019s chest to reach for his father, blithely trusting that he won\u2019t be dropped.\n\u201cSoft pats for bunnies,\u201d A-Yuan says, fingers extended to clumsily bat at Wei Wuxian\u2019s shoulder. \u201cLike this!\u201d\nLaughing, Wei Wuxian ducks around to Lan Wangji\u2019s other side, and Lan Wangji readjusts once more as A-Yuan sways back upright, grinning happily. \u201cSoft pats!\u201d\n\u201cVery soft pats,\u201d Wei Wuxian agrees, smiling.\nWhen they reach the meadow, Xichen stops and theatrically puts a finger to his lips, signaling silence. A-Yuan hides his head against Lan Wangji\u2019s shoulder, still apparently intimidated by Xichen, but is coaxed into looking up again when Wei Wuxian whispers, \u201cIf you get down now, you can see them.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d A-Yuan mumbles.\nAs he starts to shift again, Lan Wangji gently lowers him down. His heart twists a bit when, instead of moving straight to his father, A-Yuan clings to his legs, staring uncertainly up at him.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Lan Wangji says. \u201cI promise.\u201d\nNodding, A-Yuan makes a brave face and extends a hand to Wei Wuxian, letting himself be guided forwards. He goes slowly, looking around for the promised bunnies, and audibly gasps in delight when one of the rabbits hops onto a nearby rock and sits there, ears twitching.\nThere\u2019s no good reason for Lan Wangji to feel as tense as he does, watching A-Yuan approach the bunny. The Cloud Recesses rabbits are tame, accustomed to being picked up and carried, to say nothing of their collective assumption that most human visitors come bearing treats. And yet he feels unbearably relieved \u2013 and just as unbearably fond \u2013 when Wei Wuxian picks up the rabbit and successfully transfers it to A-Yuan\u2019s arms.\n\u201cBunny,\u201d A-Yuan whispers. He looks almost on the verge of tears, he\u2019s so happy, one hand clumsily (but nonetheless gently) stroking along the rabbit\u2019s back while his other arm cuddles it close. \u201cSoft bunny. Best bunny.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a measure of how distracted Lan Wangji is by the sight that he doesn\u2019t notice Xichen coming to stand beside him until his brother murmurs, voice pitched for him alone, \u201cI thought he was supposed to be a fake date.\u201d\n\u201cThings changed,\u201d says Lan Wangji, shocked to hear the rasp in his voice. He glances at Xichen, suddenly awash with uncertainty. \u201cAre you upset with me?\u201d\nXichen\u2019s brows lift high. \u201cOf course not!\u201d he says. He hesitates, then says, achingly gentle, \u201cWangji. The way you look at them both, and the way they look at you\u2026 seeing you that happy is the best gift you could give me.\u201d\nLan Wangji inhales so sharply, it\u2019s like he\u2019s been stabbed. He stares at Xichen, completely at a loss for words, and is absurdly grateful when his brother smiles and hefts his actual, wrapped present. \u201cOf course, I haven\u2019t opened this yet. I could be wrong.\u201d\n\u201cOpen it and find out,\u201d says Lan Wangji.\nEyes crinkling, Xichen obliges, tearing neatly along the seam of the blue and silver paper. Wangji watches as the long, polished wooden case is revealed, silently taking the discarded wrapping as Xichen flips the clasp and opens it. Inside is a beautiful antique xiao, snugged protectively in soft, fitted padding.\nXichen\u2019s mouth falls open a little. Reverently, he touches the instrument, a light stroke along the polished length.\n\u201cWangji,\u201d he breathes. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d He looks at him, all warm joy and sincerity. \u201cThank you.\u201d\nLan Wangji inclines his head, pleased that his gift has been well-received. \u201cIt is my pleasure.\u201d\nXichen looks lovingly at the xiao for a moment longer, then shuts the case. \u201cIf you don\u2019t object, I\u2019m going to take this straight back to my room; I couldn\u2019t bear to have it damaged.\u201d His smile turns sly. \u201cI trust the three of you will be all right in my absence?\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d says Lan Wangji, ignoring the way his ears heat up.\n\u201cI\u2019ll take the wrapping, too,\u201d says Xichen, and once he has it hand, he begins to head back towards the main compound.\nLan Wangji watches him vanish around the curve of the hill, then turns his attention back to Wei Wuxian and A-Yuan. What he sees almost makes his heart stop: Wei Wuxian is sitting against the rock, A-Yuan cuddled in his lap, still holding the original bunny as two more snuffle around his feet. Wei Wuxian is smiling at his son, whose face is so crinkled up with happiness that his eyes have almost disappeared into his cheeks.\nBefore he can second-guess himself, Lan Wangji pulls out his phone, opens the camera and takes a series of photos: closeups of both A-Yuan and Wei Wuxian\u2019s faces, and two shots of the pair of them together. Then he takes a deep breath, puts his phone away, and walks over to join them.\nWei Wuxian looks up at his approach, a soft smile on his face. \u201cI think this might be his best day ever.\u201d\nA-Yuan nods, burying his face in the bunny\u2019s soft fur. Lan Wangji considers a moment, then sits down beside Wei Wuxian, thrilling a little as their arms brush. Another rabbit approaches, nose twitching in anticipation of treats, and Lan Wangji scoops it up carefully, cradling it in his hands.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s your brother gone?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t let us chase him away.\u201d\nLan Wangji shakes his head. \u201cHe\u2019s just taking his present back to his room. He\u2019ll return soon enough.\u201d\n\u201cOh. That\u2019s good.\u201d Wei Wuxian hesitates, looking for all the world like he\u2019s going to say something, but before he can get it out, A-Yuan yelps as the bunny in his arms finally decides it wants to get down. Wei Wuxian instantly soothes him, assuring him that he hasn\u2019t done anything wrong, the bunny just wants to move around again, and look, there\u2019s plenty more! Lan Wangji hands his own rabbit over to help make the point, showing A-Yuan how to pluck the longest bits of grass and feed them to the bunnies. A-Yuan is delighted, and soon enough all three of them are preoccupied as more bunnies show up, not realizing that the \u201ctreat\u201d they\u2019re being fed is the same grass they normally eat.\nSomehow, Lan Wangji ends up sitting even closer to Wei Wuxian than he was originally, though he has no idea which of them closed the gap. Having exhausted the nearby supplies of long grass, A-Yuan clambers up and goes to grab fistfuls of it from slightly further afield, and when he comes back \u2013 walking with exaggerated care so as not to disturb the bunnies \u2013 he clambers unhesitatingly onto both their laps, face serious as he distributes grass to each of them.\n\u201cGot to be fair,\u201d he says. \u201cBeing fair is imptant.\u201d He pulls a face, looking inquiringly at Wei Wuxian. \u201cImp-rortant?\u201d\n\u201cIm-por-tant.\u201d\n\u201cImpor-tant,\u201d says A-Yuan.\nWei Wuxian laughs and kisses his head. \u201cPerfect.\u201d\n\u201cVery good,\u201d Lan Wangji agrees, and feels his whole chest swell when A-Yuan beams at him.\nA polite cough from some feet away signals the return of Xichen. Lan Wangji flushes \u2013 he has no idea how long his brother has been standing there \u2013 and moves to stand, but Xichen waves for him to stay seated. Evidently braver now that he\u2019s surrounded by bunnies, A-Yuan watches carefully as Xichen sits down an armslength away from Lan Wangji, plucking grass to feed an approaching rabbit.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get your suit dirty,\u201d Lan Wangji says, mildly.\nXichen smiles. \u201cIt\u2019s only a suit. So,\u201d he says, turning to Wei Wuxian, \u201cwhen does this one start at school? Have you thought about enrolments yet?\u201d\nWei Wuxian grins ruefully. \u201cOh, only about once an hour for the past six months. There\u2019s three different elementary schools in our district, but they\u2019ve all got different schedules and different reputations, and I\u2019m still trying to figure out which would be the best fit.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are the options?\u201d Xichen asks.\nAs Wei Wuxian launches into a description of the available schools, Lan Wangji leans against his side and brushes a stray piece of grass from A-Yuan\u2019s hair. He listens carefully, frowning when Wei Wuxian mentions that the school with the best academic record also has a reputation for putting too much pressure on its students.\n\u201cA-Yuan doesn\u2019t need pressure,\u201d he finds himself saying. \u201cSurely his social and emotional development is more important than a few extra points on a standardized test per year.\u201d\nWei Wuxian makes an enthusiastic noise of agreement. \u201cThank you! That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been saying, but Jiang Cheng keeps insisting that I\u2019m being lazy about it just because I used to get into trouble at school.\u201d\n\u201cThat hardly seems fair,\u201d says Lan Wangji, annoyed on his behalf.\n\u201cLan Zhan, you\u2019re the best,\u201d says Wei Wuxian, and promptly renders him speechless by kissing his cheek again. \u201cOnce Jiang Cheng hears that Hanguang-Jun is on my side, he\u2019ll have to rethink his position!\u201d\n\u201cWhat about the other two schools?\u201d asks Xichen, courteously not remarking on the fact that Lan Wangji\u2019s ears are now bright red.\nAs Wei Wuxian once more warms to theme of A-Yuan\u2019s education, Lan Wangji feels something soft and bright swell within his chest. Like a new dawn rising between his ribs, the realization creeps over him: this is what family feels like. Nothing involving Lan Qiren has ever made him feel anything like this, and though the thought of facing his uncle still looms like a cloud on the horizon, for the sake of this moment \u2013 for the sake of the bubble of peace in which he sits, with Xichen and Wei Wuxian, A-Yuan and the rabbits \u2013 whatever happens later, Lan Wangji silently decides that coming back to Cloud Recesses will never have been a mistake.\nTheir time in the meadow is perfect, but \u2013 inevitably \u2013 it cannot last. A little before 10am, with much regretful sighing and assurances to an overjoyed, overwhelmed A-Yuan that the bunnies will be fine on their own, they troop back up to the compound. Lan Wangji was too distracted to notice before, but a drinks marquee has been set up at one end of the courtyard, while the sliding doors of the main hall have all been thrown open. There\u2019s a lavish buffet set up against the far wall, with plenty of chairs and tables for the guests \u2013 more have been brough out into the courtyard since their arrival, the tablecloths cleverly weighted down to keep from blowing away \u2013 while a string quartet is setting up in the corner.\n\u201cI\u2019ll need to start greeting people soon,\u201d says Xichen, a touch of apology in his voice. \u201cI\u2019ll find you again later, though, okay?\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d says Lan Wangji. \u201cIt\u2019s your birthday. You deserve to have a wonderful time.\u201d\nXichen smiles in answer, nods at Wei Wuxian and A-Yuan, the latter of whom is balanced on the former\u2019s hip, and heads off to speak to one of the catering staff.\n\u201cThat drinks tent,\u201d says Wei Wuxian, casting a speculative eye over the marquee. \u201cDoes it contain alcohol?\u201d\n\u201cIt does,\u201d says Lan Wangji, mouth curving into a not-quite-smile. \u201cUncle still keeps to that particular GusuLan rule himself, but has begrudgingly allowed that certain gatherings can be an exception.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t drink, either,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, with just a tiny note of question.\n\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Lan Wangji allows. \u201cOriginally because of the GusuLan rules, but subsequently because I learned that I have absolutely no tolerance for it.\u201d\n\u201cReally? How little tolerance?\u201d\nLan Wangji snorts. \u201cBased on past experience, if I have a single glass of champagne, I\u2019ll pass out inside of fifteen minutes.\u201d\nWei Wuxian pretends to consider this, then says, \u201cAs much as I\u2019d like to see you all cute and sleepy, I\u2019m kind of counting on you to drive us home, so that\u2019ll have to be an experiment for another day. As for me, though, I could really go for some alcohol right about now.\u201d He hesitates. \u201cAssuming you don\u2019t mind, of course.\u201d\n\u201cBy all means,\u201d says Lan Wangji, and basks in the glow of Wei Wuxian\u2019s answering smile.\nAs his not-a-fake-date heads for the marquee, Lan Wangji turns and sees that guests are starting to arrive, small groups of people entering through the balloon arch at the top of the ramp. Inasmuch as he ever attends parties, he\u2019s used to university student conventions, where the given start time of any event is a very loose guideline, and where nobody really starts to arrive until a good half hour to an hour later than that. Cultivation gatherings, however, are invariably punctual affairs, with the result that guests tend to show up in clusters. Already he can see a handful of Xichen\u2019s university friends paying their respects to his brother, and close behind them are the Nie brothers, as distinct from each other as they are distinctive. As Nie Mingjue joins the circle around Xichen, Nie Huaisang casts a cheerful glance around the courtyard \u2013 he is, as always, carrying a folding fan, this one decorated with cranes \u2013 and lights up when he sees Lan Wangji.\n\u201cHanguang-Jun!\u201d he exclaims, hurrying over. Unlike his elder brother, who has eschewed his usual black leather jacket and ripped jeans for a black suit (though the jacket is already discarded, the sleeves rolled up to his elbows and the tie fashionably loosened, conspiring with his moustache to make him look like a rakish businessman hitting a club after hours), Nie Huaisang is wearing a pale green blouse tucked into dark grey skinny jeans, which are in turn tucked into wedge-heeled ankle boots. The blouse is tight at the wrists but slightly billowy everywhere else, and unless Lan Wangji is very much mistaken, he\u2019s also wearing eyeliner.\n\u201cNie Huaisang,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you.\u201d\n\u201cOf course! Our brothers are such great friends, it would\u2019ve been impossible not to come.\u201d He flicks his fan so as to shield his face from onlookers and murmurs, \u201cAlso, I heard that things might get\u2026 interesting.\u201d\nLan Wangji\u2019s pulse ticks up a notch. Part of him wants to deny it, but the rest of him can\u2019t be bothered, too strung out with waiting for the proverbial shit to hit the fan to want to prolong the experience. \u201cThey very well may,\u201d he admits.\n\u201cNie-xiong!\u201d calls Wei Wuxian, returning from the marquee with a champagne flute in one hand and A-Yuan by his side. A-Yuan is walking very carefully, holding what appears to be a cup of apple juice in both small hands. \u201cI was hoping you\u2019d be here!\u201d\nNie Huaisang\u2019s face wheels through delight, surprise and disbelief at breakneck speed before finally settling on a species of polite shock. \u201cWei-xiong!\u201d he says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting to see you here!\u201d He smiles, a tiny bit manic but mostly impressed, shaking his fan at Wei Wuxian\u2019s chest. \u201cThat shirt is certainly a choice. And who is your small friend?\u201d\nWei Wuxian grins, a man in his chaotic element. \u201cThis is my son, A-Yuan,\u201d he says, proudly.\nNie Huaisang looks briefly like his eyes are going to fall out of his head. \u201cYour son?\u201d he says, and Lan Wangji realizes, with a mix of annoyance and fondness, that he\u2019s going to be hearing variants on this theme for a great deal of the party.\n\u201cYes, my son! A-Yuan, do you like Nie-xiong\u2019s fan? It has cranes on it!\u201d\nA-Yuan blinks at Nie Huaisang over the top of his cup. \u201cIt\u2019s nice, I guess,\u201d he says, a little dubiously, and takes a large sip of his juice.\n\u201cThe sass is genetic,\u201d says Wei Wuxian, affecting a stage-whisper. \u201cDid you know, I bore him with my own body?\u201d\nNie Husaisang\u2019s mouth hangs open for a solid two seconds; then he snaps shut both fan and jaw, looking for all the world like a man in desperate need of a witty retort but unable, just now, to come up with one. Fortunately for his dignity, he is spared the burden of replying by A-Yuan, who squeals with delight and very nearly throws his juice in the air.\n\u201cAyi! Jiujiu!\u201d he shouts, and only barely manages to shove his drink into Wei Wuxian\u2019s hand before bolting away across the courtyard, to where \u2013 Lan Wangji fights off a sudden wave of anxiety \u2013 Jiang Yanli and Jiang Cheng have just stepped through the balloon arch.\n\u201cExcuse us,\u201d Wei Wuxian says to Nie Huaisang, who looks even more confused now than he did a moment ago, and somehow manages to link arms with Lan Wangji without spilling a drop of either drink, walking him over to greet his family.\n\u201cA-Yuan!\u201d says Jiang Yanli, already crouched down to hug her nephew. Her expression is bright and happy, a marked contrast to the semi-permanent scowl affected by Jiang Cheng. \u201cLook at you, I think you\u2019ve grown already! And you\u2019re wearing the shirt I sent you!\u201d\n\u2018It\u2019s the best shirt!\u201d A-Yuan says. \u201cAyi, guess what? There\u2019s bunnies here, and I patted them!\u201d\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s wonderful!\u201d Jiang Yanli says. \u201cYou must tell me all about it!\u201d\nAs A-Yuan begins to do just that, Jiang Cheng shoots Wei Wuxian a thoroughly disapproving look and mutters, in lieu of greeting, \u201cI still say we should be shushu and guma, not jiujiu and ayi. You aren\u2019t his mother. And what on earth are you wearing?\u201d\n\u201cHello to you too, shidi!\u201d says Wei Wuxian, who has evidently committed to the role of Provocative Little Shit. The fact that Lan Wangji finds it even remotely attractive should probably be worrying. \u201cAnd what do you mean, I\u2019m not his mother? I bore him with my own body!\u201d\n\u201cGross,\u201d says Jiang Cheng. \u201cDoes that mean you\u2019re not calling yourself his father now?\u201d\n\u201cI am also his father,\u201d says Wei Wuxian blithely. \u201cI contain multitudes, Jiang Cheng. Do not stifle me with your gender-normative bullsh\u2013 \u201d He breaks off, glancing guiltily at A-Yuan, and self-corrects: \u201c\u2013 nonsense.\u201d\n\u201cHello, Jiang Wanyin, Jiang Yanli,\u201d says Lan Wangji, who feels he ought to say something at this point.\nJiang Yanli flashes him a quick smile, still crouched down and listening animatedly to A-Yuan\u2019s rapturous descriptions of bunnies. Jiang Cheng adjusts the timbre of his scowl to something slightly more polite and says to Lan Wangji, \u201cYou\u2019re really dating this idiot?\u201d\nLan Wangji looks at him, unimpressed. \u201cI\u2019m really dating Wei Ying.\u201d\n\u201cWell, good luck with that. Ow!\u201d This last in injured response to Jiang Yanli, who has swiftly and mercilessly corked her brother in the thigh without so much as breaking eye contact with her nephew. Jiang Cheng rubs at his leg, visibly wincing, and then \u2013 to Lan Wangji\u2019s great surprise, mumbles, \u201cSorry, that was rude. Really, I\u2019m glad he\u2019s found someone.\u201d\n\u201cAw, Jiang Cheng, thank you!\u201d says Wei Wuxian.\n\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d Jaing Cheng huffs, half impatience and half embarrassment. \u201cNow, where the hell did you get that champagne?\u201d\nWei Wuxian points to the marquee, and Jiang Cheng immediately beelines for it.\n\u201cI apologise for my brother\u2019s bad manners,\u201d says Jiang Yanli, finally straightening up once more. She pats A-Yuan fondly on the head, and when he stretches out his hands, Wei Wuxian obediently hands him the rest of his apple juice. \u201cHe\u2019s\u2026 tetchy, about family matters.\u201d\n\u201cAlso, he was dropped a lot as a baby,\u201d says Wei Wuxian, grinning unrepentantly.\nJiang Yanli swats his arm, just a smidge too hard to be wholly playful. \u201cA-Xian, stop it. You\u2019re setting your son a bad example!\u201d\nWei Wuxian ducks his head, contrite. \u201cSorry, shijie.\u201d\n\u201cJuice done!\u201d A-Yuan pronounces, brandishing his now-empty cup. He looks between the three adults, hands it to Lan Wangji \u2013 who accepts it without thinking \u2013 then turns straight back to Wei Wuxian, tugs imploringly on the hem of his crop-top and says, \u201cAirplane, gege? You promised!\u201d\nWei Wuxian sighs theatrically. \u201cI did promise that, didn\u2019t I? Well! Never let it be said that I\u2019m not a man of my word.\u201d He drains the last of his champagne, winking cheekily as he, too, hands his empty glass to Lan Wangji, and takes A-Yuan by the hand, leading him out into an open, as-yet unoccupied bit of courtyard.\n\u201cAirplane!\u201d shouts A-Yuan.\nCurious, Lan Wangji watches from Jiang Yanli\u2019s side as Wei Wuxian grips his son by the forearms, lifts him up and promptly begins to spin him around, so fast and with such strength that A-Yuan swings with him like a giggling, shrieking helicopter blade. Around and around they go, a joyful blur of movement, until finally, Wei Wuxian starts to slow again.\n\u201cI\u2019m getting dizzy!\u201d he proclaims, laughing as he lowers A-Yuan to the ground. His face is flushed, a few stray hairs escaping his ribbon, and as he smiles at his son, he looks so achingly beautiful that Lan Wangji\u2019s heart damn near thumps right out of his chest.\n\u201cAgain, gege!\u201d says A-Yuan, holding his arms up. \u201cAgain! Again!\u201d\n\u201cAgain?\u201d Wei Wuxian puts his hands on his hips. \u201cYou ought to be dizzy by now! Why aren\u2019t you dizzy?\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cAgain!\u201d\n\u201cOnce more, then,\u201d says Wei Wuxian, and is just taking up his grip on A-Yuan\u2019s forearms when a familiar voice bellows across the courtyard, \u201cWei Wuxian, what are you doing to that child?\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\nDressed in a severe grey suit, Lan Qiren storms across the paving, advancing on Wei Wuxian with a murderous look that turns almost to apoplexy when he comes close enough to read the writing on his crop top.\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Lan Wangji whispers, and awkwardly thrusts both cup and glass into Jiang Yanli\u2019s hands as he moves to intercept his uncle. His heart is hammering: all the guests have turned to watch, staring in surprise at the unfolding drama.\n\u201cWe\u2019re playing,\u201d says Wei Wuxian, nonplussed. He forces a cheery smile and lifts his chin. \u201cIt\u2019s called airplane.\u201d\nFace reddening, Lan Qiren takes another step closer. \u201cYou,\u201d he hisses, pointing a finger at Wei Wuxian, \u201cshould not be allowed near anyone\u2019s child! Just look at you!\u201d He glances furiously around the courtyard and demands, \u201cWhose son is this?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s mine,\u201d says Wei Wuxian, gaze turning sharp and hard as flint. \u201cAnd you\u2019re scaring him.\u201d\nLan Qiren freezes in place, face red with shock. It gives Lan Wangji just enough time to reach them, stepping up to put an arm around Wei Wuxian\u2019s shoulders, positioning himself so that A-Yuan \u2013 who does, indeed, look terrified in a way that makes his blood boil \u2013 is sheltered between them.\n\u201cUncle,\u201d he says, deadly calm. \u201cIs there a good reason why you\u2019re shouting at my boyfriend?\u201d\nAt the word boyfriend, Lan Qiren goes from red to purple. He stares at Lan Wangji, his expression one of tortured, furious betrayal. \u201cDo you mean to tell me,\u201d he says, voice shaking with rage, \u201cthat you are \u2013 associating with this reprobate?\u201d \u00a0\n\u201cYes,\u201d says Lan Wangji \u2013 and then, because apparently Wei Wuxian\u2019s biting sass is rubbing off on him, \u201cFrequently and with pleasure.\u201d\nWei Wuxian makes a choked sound like he\u2019s fighting back laughter; Lan Qiren, however, has a look on his face like he\u2019s just seen someone beheaded.\n\u201cYou dare,\u201d he says, so angry he can barely speak, \u201cyou dare, you dare to bring him here \u2013 to my home, to this hallowed place \u2013 on your brother\u2019s birthday, you dare to bring that catamite \u2013\u201d\n\u201cSTOP BEING MEAN TO MY BABA!\u201d\nThe words are furious, loud and trembling with a child\u2019s righteous fury as A-Yuan \u2013 A-Yuan, who is all of four \u2013 puts his tiny hands on his tiny hips and glares at Lan Qiren with eyes that are seconds from spilling over with tears. Face ashen, Wei Wuxian drops down and tries to hug A-Yuan against him, but A-Yuan sniffs mightily and pulls against his arms, refusing to be turned away.\n\u201cYou\u2019re mean,\u201d he says again, the words coming out in a terrible gulp, and then he really does start to cry, fat tears rolling down his cheeks as he turns his face to Lan Wangji and asks, through hitching breaths, \u201cZhan-ge, is airplane bad? Did I get you in trouble?\u201d And then, his voice a terrible wail, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nHeart breaking, Lan Wangji drops to his knees and pulls A-Yuan into a fierce hug, which, as Wei Wuxian is also still holding him, has the effect of pulling them both in at once, so that A-Yuan is smothered between them.\n\u201cB\u01ceob\u01ceo, no,\u201d Lan Wangji rasps, just as Wei Wuxian says, \u201cYou did nothing wrong, nothing.\u201d\nA-Yuan keeps crying, his wet face pressed to Lan Wangji\u2019s chest, and in that moment, were Bichen with him, Lan Wangji would gladly have drawn on his uncle. Lacking a sword, he shoots him a venomous stare instead, and feels nothing but cold satisfaction to see that Lan Qiren has now gone white, staring down at the three of them with an almost broken expression.\nHe looks, for the first time in Lan Wangji\u2019s life, not like a force of nature, but a tired and brittle old man.\nAll at once, Xichen appears, face shadowed as he touches Lan Qiren\u2019s shoulder.\n\u201cUncle,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cRespectfully, you are overwrought. I think you should go back inside and rest.\u201d\nLan Qiren jerks, lips parted as he looks at Xichen, and for a horrible second Lan Wangji thinks he\u2019s about to start yelling again. But all Lan Qiren does is shake his head \u2013 bewildered, angry but subdued \u2013 and turn away, striding jerkily back towards his residence.\nXichen watches him go, then crouches down beside them, resting a hand on Lan Wangji\u2019s shoulder and squeezing gently.\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he says, sounding genuinely gutted. \u201cI didn\u2019t think he\u2019d behave like that towards a child.\u201d\nLan Wangji swallows and turns back to A-Yuan, unable to muster up a reply. He hadn\u2019t thought so, either, and yet he\u2019s suddenly overwhelmed with memories of being shouted at by Uncle when he, too was small; of how unrelentingly stern he was, even after their parents died; of being told to meditate whenever he was crying.\nA-Yuan is hiccupping now, slowly calming as Wei Wuxian hugs him around the waist, murmuring into his ear, \u201cYou did nothing wrong. You were brave and good. The mean man is gone, it\u2019s okay, I\u2019m sorry, shh, it wasn\u2019t your fault, I promise.\u201d\n\u201cPromise?\u201d A-Yuan whispers.\n\u201cI promise,\u201d says Wei Wuxian, \u201cand so does Zhan-ge.\u201d\n\u201cI do,\u201d says Lan Wangji, thumbing a tear from A-Yuan\u2019s cheek when he looks to him for confirmation. \u201cI promise, you did nothing wrong. You aren\u2019t in any trouble.\u201d\nA-Yuan gives a wobbly nod and shuts his eyes, going almost limp as he turns and tucks his face into Wei Wuxian\u2019s shoulder, arms curling around his neck. As they both rise, Lan Wangji helps to steady Wei Wuxian with a hand on his elbow, A-Yuan clinging on like a creeper vine.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go sit somewhere quiet, hm?\u201d Wei Wuxian says, jogging A-Yuan gently.\n\u201cGo wherever you wish,\u201d says Xichen. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d\nSparing his brother a grateful nod, Lan Wangji puts an arm around Wei Wuxian\u2019s shoulders, as much to help shield him from the stares of onlookers as for mutual comfort, and steers them away in silence, his stomach twisting itself in knots.\n\nThis is all my fault. \n\nLan Wangji leads them all to the Jingshi, a single, small residence set back a little from the main compound. The Jingshi is both his and not-his: a place he was allowed to study and meditate as a teenager, but which he has never truly inhabited. And yet it is also understood to be his house-in-waiting, a place earmarked as his in the hope that he, like Xichen, will one day return to live at Cloud Recesses. The irony isn\u2019t lost on him, but whatever its thematic failings, the Jingshi is nonetheless quiet, unoccupied and out of the way, which right now is what they need.\nAs Lan Wangji pulls away from Wei Wuxian to open the door and toe off his shoes, he feels a lump rise in his throat. Will I ever come back here again?\n\u201cI think he\u2019s asleep,\u201d Wei Wuxian murmurs. He hesitates on the threshold: his boots aren\u2019t so easily removed, but he can\u2019t put down the drowsing A-Yuan, now a deadweight in his arms, in order to untie the laces.\nWithout thinking, Lan Wangji goes to his knees and starts to unlace Wei Wuxian\u2019s boots. He already has the first undone when he realizes it would\u2019ve been easier to simply take A-Yuan. He feels the back of his neck heat up as Wei Wuxian, rather than pointing this out, silently lifts his foot instead, balancing carefully as Lan Wangji levers the boot off. He repeats the procedure on the other side, then flows back to his feet, unable to meet Wei Wuxian\u2019s gaze as he enters the Jingshi and carries A-Yuan over to the double futon set against the wall in the second room.\nGently, Wei Wuxian lays A-Yuan down on the mattress, smoothing the hair from his forehead with shaky fingers. A-Yuan\u2019s face is blotchy from crying, his cheeks puffy and creased from being pressed against his father\u2019s shirt, but his eyes stay closed as he makes a grizzling noise and wriggles his head onto the pillow, little body curling into an exhausted half-moon. Wei Wuxian slumps against the futon, head bowed, and as Lan Wangji comes to kneel beside him, he feels his throat tighten.\n\u201cThis is all my fault,\u201d he croaks, just as Wei Wuxian says, \u201cI\u2019m a terrible father.\u201d\nThey both jerk and look at each other. \u201cYou\u2019re an excellent father,\u201d Lan Wangji says. He reaches out and covers Wei Wuxian\u2019s hand with his own. \u201cYou did nothing wrong. I\u2019m the one who asked you to provoke my uncle, which means it was my responsibility to ensure that nothing happened to A-Yuan. I should\u2019ve known \u2013\u201d he withdraws his hand, fingers curling into a fist, \u201c\u2013 that he was capable of this. You have every right to hate me, and if you want to leave, I\u2019ll pay for a cab to take both of you home \u2013\u201d\n\u201cLan Zhan!\u201d Wei Wuxian grabs his fist and squeezes it, looking distraught. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not \u2013 this isn\u2019t your fault at all. He\u2019s my son, I should\u2019ve just picked him up and walked away as soon as your uncle got close, not stood there riling him up. I don\u2019t hate you, please.\u201d He squeezes again, thumb stroking the side of Lan Wangji\u2019s hand. \u201cI couldn\u2019t.\u201d\nLan Wangji lets out a shuddering breath, and realizes, to his intense dismay and shame, that he\u2019s on the brink of tears. \u201cYou should blame me,\u201d he says, the words coming out choked. He bows his head, unable to bear the soft worry that sparks in Wei Wuxian\u2019s eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t \u2013 I didn\u2019t think, I knew he\u2019d be angry but I thought it would be at me. What\u2019s the use of him shouting at you, at A-Yuan? What you do, how you live, he can hate it, but it doesn\u2019t affect him. I affect him, I\u2019m the one he wants to fix \u2013\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need fixing,\u201d Wei Wuxian says fiercely. He cups Lan Wangji\u2019s face in his hands, forcing him to meet his gaze. Lan Wangji gulps and shudders, unable to help from leaning into the touch as Wei Wuxian strokes his cheek. \u201cLan Zhan, this is on him, not you. And maybe a little on me \u2013\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d says Lan Wangji. Trembling, he reaches up and puts his right hand over Wei Wuxian\u2019s left. \u201cIf it\u2019s not on me, then it\u2019s not on you, either.\u201d\nWei Wuxian laughs and shuts his eyes. \u201cLan Zhan, Lan Zhan. What are we doing? Because if this is how you pretend to date someone, I\u2019m not sure I could survive the real thing.\u201d\n\u201cThis is the real thing,\u201d Lan Wangji whispers, heart pounding as Wei Wuxian\u2019s eyes snap open. \u201cWei Ying, I thought \u2013 was I not clear? I want you. I want this.\u201d\n\u201cNo. Yes. Maybe. I don\u2019t know. I mean, I hoped, but I thought \u2013\u201d he laughs again, a little wild and a lot self-deprecating in a way that makes Lan Wangji\u2019s heart ache, \u201c\u2013 I thought you just wanted sex.\u201d He smiles, sad and crooked. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I have much else to offer.\u201d\nLan Wangji makes a hurt noise and leans in, pressing their foreheads together. \u201cWei Ying,\u201d he whispers. \u201cYou have everything to offer. And I want \u2013 if you\u2019ll have me, I would be privileged to \u2013\u201d\nWei Wuxian kisses him, sweet and hot and desperate. He tastes of champagne, and Lan Wangji kisses back with an urgency he scarcely understands. The angle is awkward, but the fit of their mouths is perfect, \u00a0and when they pull away again, hands linked in their laps, they both instinctively glance at A-Yuan, still asleep on the futon.\nAll at once, something flashes across Wei Wuxian\u2019s face, an expression of tender wonderment that Lan Wangji wants to capture forever. \u201cHe called me baba,\u201d Wei Wuxian whispers. \u201cTo your uncle, he said I was baba.\u201d \u00a0He looks at Lan Wangji, overwhelmed. \u201cHe\u2019s never called me that before. As long as he\u2019s known me, I\u2019ve always been gege, and I know \u2013 I know I call myself his father, but I wasn\u2019t ever sure he\u2019d agree with me.\u201d\n\u201cYou are his father,\u201d says Lan Wangji, softly. \u201cYou claimed him to care for when no one else would or could. What else would that make you?\u201d\n\u201cThe same as the men who raised us,\u201d says Wei Wuxian, just as soft.\nThe words aren\u2019t meant as a blow, but they land as one nonetheless. Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t know what his face is doing, but whatever it is makes Wei Wuxian wince. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean \u2013\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Don\u2019t apologise.\u201d He strokes a thumb along Wei Wuxian\u2019s knuckles, letting out a breath. \u201cThese past few weeks\u2026 it\u2019s not that I never disagreed with Uncle before all this, but I didn\u2019t\u2026 I didn\u2019t have a frame of reference for it. He raised me, but I\u2019ve never thought of him as a father. I knew he wasn\u2019t, and he never tried to be, and that\u2026 that never felt wrong, before. But now I look back, and I realise that it never quite felt right, either. I just didn\u2019t know what was missing.\u201d\nWei Wuxian looks away. \u201cUncle Jiang would\u2019ve been my father, I think, if not for Madam Yu. But even then, he still treated Jiang Cheng so differently, had such different expectations of us\u2026 maybe he could\u2019ve been a father, but I\u2019m not sure he would\u2019ve been the same father to us both. I\u2019m not even sure he\u2019s the same father to shijie as he is to Jiang Cheng.\u201d He laughs, then adds hastily, \u201cWhich doesn\u2019t mean he was bad, or that I don\u2019t love him! I\u2019m grateful the Jiangs took me in, and it\u2019s not like it\u2019s strange for different siblings to have different relationships with their parents. I\u2019m hardly an expert at any of this. But A-Yuan deserves a father, and I worry all the time that I\u2019m not\u2026 that I won\u2019t do it right.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe there isn\u2019t a single right way,\u201d Lan Wangji says. \u201cYou care, and you try, and you\u2019re willing to learn. That\u2019s what matters, I think. Or at least, I hope it does.\u201d He meets Wei Wuxian\u2019s gaze and says, softly, \u201cIt\u2019s all I can give to either of you.\u201d\nWei Wuxian inhales sharply. \u201cLan Zhan\u2026 A-Yuan really likes you. He doesn\u2019t take to everyone, but he took to you, and if this goes wrong \u2013\u201d\n\u201cIt won\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t know that.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe not,\u201d Lan Wangji allows, \u201cbut\u2026 what I said to you before, when we were making up stories, that I wouldn\u2019t do this if I wasn\u2019t all in? I meant it. And I am. All in.\u201d He squeezes Wei Wuxian\u2019s hand, hoping desperately that he understands. \u201cI know that I\u2019m not experienced \u2013 not at dating, not at any of this \u2013 but I want to do this with you. With both of you.\u201d\nWei Wuxian makes a choked noise and hugs him hard, face pressed against his shoulder. Lan Wangji hugs him back, breathing in the scent of his hair, and sheds a few quiet tears \u2013 of loss, of relief, of joy \u2013 in sympathy with the salt he can feel on his collarbone.\n\u201cGege?\u201d comes a sleepy voice from the futon. \u201cWhere\u2019d the party go?\u201d\nWei Wuxian laughs and pulls away, wiping a wrist across his eyes. \u201cWe\u2019re still here, b\u01ceob\u01ceo. We just went to a quiet room for a little bit.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d says A-Yuan. He rubs his eyes with clumsy fists and blinks at them, not yet sitting up. \u201cAre you sad?\u201d\n\u201cNot sad,\u201d says Wei Wuxian, smiling. \u201cJust happy, that we have Zhan-ge to help protect us from mean old men.\u201d\nA-Yuan frowns. \u201cHe was very mean.\u201d\n\u201cYes, he was,\u201d says Lan Wangji. \u201cBut he got in trouble for it, and now he\u2019s gone from the party.\u201d\n\u201cGone?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nA-Yuan considers this. \u201cGone to the naughty chair?\u201d\nWei Wuxian makes a tortured face, which Lan Wangji interprets as a desperate attempt not to laugh out loud.\n\u201cYes,\u201d says Lan Wangji gravely, when it becomes clear that Wei Wuxian, now clutching his ribs, cannot actually speak. \u201cHe has gone to the naughty chair.\u201d\nA-Yuan gives a decisive nod, as if this settles the matter. \u201cGood.\u201d He rolls on the futon and then sits up, legs dangling over the edge. \u201cCan we go back to the party now? I\u2019m hungry!\u201d\nAs if on cue, Lan Wangji\u2019s phone buzzes in his pocket. He pulls it out, lips twitching as he scans the text:\nJin Zixuan: Sorry we\u2019re running late, we\u2019ve been waiting at the bottom of the mountain for my STUPID dad to drive up first, so he can\u2019t see us &amp; bail &amp; pretend he wasn\u2019t coming in the first place. But he just went past, so we\u2019ll be there soon! \u00a0\n\u201cWell,\u201d says Lan Wangji, smiling at Wei Wuxian. \u201cWhat does Wei Ying think?\u201d\nWei Wuxian grins and opens his arms to his son. \u201cLet\u2019s get back out there.\u201d\nWalking back from the Jingshi, A-Yuan insists on holding both their hands. At first, he only bounces along between them, excited by the possibility of cake, but once he trips over the uneven paving and realizes that Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian can hold him off the ground, he keeps trying to swing between them. It\u2019s awkward at first, as A-Yuan doesn\u2019t so much articulate his desire for swinging as he does suddenly and unexpectedly tuck up his legs and hang his whole deadweight from their unsuspecting arms, but once Wei Wuxian establishes the intended goal, they\u2019re able to execute it with ease. Every three steps by A-Yuan\u2019s count, they lift him into the air, giggling and laughing, only for him to resume the count as soon as his feet return to earth. For all that Lan Wangji keeps up with his swordplay, it\u2019s surprisingly tiring, and yet he\u2019d sooner cut off his arm than stop.\nIn this way, they re-enter the party: with a laughing, happy A-Yuan swinging between their hands as they smile at each other over his head.\n\u201cA-Xian!\u201d cries Jiang Yanli, hurrying over to see them. Her expression is equal parts relief and worry, and to Lan Wangji\u2019s surprise (and mild suspicion) she is tailed by Jiang Cheng, whose scowl at this point could mean anything.\n\u201cShijie!\u201d says Wei Wuxian, releasing A-Yuan as he runs to hug her legs. \u201cSorry, that was all a bit intense \u2013 we didn\u2019t mean to worry you.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve nothing to apologise for!\u201d she says, stroking A-Yuan\u2019s hair. \u201cI just wanted to make sure you were all okay.\u201d\n\u201cI saw it all from the drinks tent,\u201d says Jiang Cheng. \u201cNo offence, Lan Wangji, but if your uncle shows his face out here again, I\u2019m going to have words with him.\u201d\n\u201cNo offence taken,\u201d Lan Wangji says, darkly. \u201cIn fact, I would gladly join you.\u201d\nJiang Cheng looks first surprised at this, then pleased, before finally seeming to recall that he doesn\u2019t actually like looking pleased, and so his scowl returns, albeit less convincingly than before. \u201cWell, good,\u201d he says, gruffly. He sips his wine and then gestures towards the balloon arch with his glass. \u201cOh, look. Jin Guangshan is here.\u201d His scowl intensifies. \u201cI imagine the peacock will be along soon, too.\u201d\nJiang Yanli shoots him a sharp look, though there\u2019s an odd touch of colour to her cheeks. \u201cA-Cheng, you will behave yourself.\u201d \u00a0\n\u201cYes, yes.\u201d He flaps a hand. \u201cI\u2019m going to go talk to Nie Huaisang. Surely you can\u2019t object to that.\u201d He flicks his gaze to Wei Wuxian, appears to change his mind about saying something, and then crouches down to A-Yuan\u2019s level, giving him an affectionate tap on the shoulder. \u201cCome find me if you get bored, okay? I\u2019m much more fun than these two.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, jiujiu!\u201d A-Yuan says, and a tiny smile crosses Jiang Cheng\u2019s face before, scowl once more firmly in place, he stalks off in search of Nie Huaisang.\n\u201cShijie,\u201d says Wei Wuxian. His face is apologetic, but at the same time, his tone is oddly reluctant. \u201cYou should know, Jin Zixuan\u2019s father is trying to make him marry Luo Qingyang, but he doesn\u2019t want to. So if you see him with her today, or with some other date, it\u2019s not because he\u2019s involved with them; he\u2019s just trying to send a message.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d says Jiang Yanli, cheeks darkening just a little. \u201cThank you, A-Xian. That is\u2026 good to know.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d A-Yuan says, plaintively.\nJiang Yanli smiles at him. \u201cThen we must feed you! Why don\u2019t you come with me, I\u2019m sure we can find something good to eat.\u201d She glances at Wei Wuxian as she says this, receiving his permission in the form of a grateful nod, and just like that, A-Yuan is being led away towards the buffet by his ayi, leaving Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian, for the first time today, alone with each other.\n\u201cWell!\u201d says Wei Wuxian brightly. \u201cHere we are, then.\u201d\nFrom where they\u2019d been setting up earlier in the open hall, the string quartet finally starts playing. Lan Wangji vaguely recognizes the music, something lively and classical without being brash, but is far less interested in identifying it than he is in taking Wei Wuxian\u2019s hand and lacing their fingers together. Wei Wuxian startles at first, then flushes, visibly pleased. Encouraged, Lan Wangji leans in and kisses the corner of his mouth and murmurs, \u201cA-Ying.\u201d\nWei Wuxian shivers. Voice equally low, he replies, \u201cA-Zhan.\u201d\nLan Wangji swallows. He feels almost giddy, warm from his core to the tips of his ears, toes, fingers. The simple intimacy of the moment \u2013 just their joined hands, the exchange of endearments \u2013 is something he\u2019s never had before; had been so certain he couldn\u2019t have that he\u2019d almost convinced himself he didn\u2019t want it at all. But now that he has it \u2013 and with it, the promise of so much more \u2013 it feels like dipping his toes into a hot bath after an interminable day\u2019s labour. He wants to put it into words, but is still struggling to find the right ones when both he and Wei Wuxian are distracted by a sudden babble of voices from near the balloon arch.\n\u201cOh, here we go,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, his whole face alight with mischief as Jin Zixuan, Mo Xuanyu, Meng Yao and a woman Lan Wangji assumes is Qin Su arrive together. He catches Jin Zixaun\u2019s eye \u2013 or attempts to, rather; it\u2019s difficult, as his friend is wearing a pair of huge gold aviators \u2013 and gives him a nod of greeting. Jin Zixuan grins broadly in response, then beelines for Xichen, arms spread wide as he loudly calls out a birthday greeting.\n\u201cJin Guangshan is in the marquee,\u201d Wei Wuxian murmurs. \u201cI give it fifteen seconds, tops, before all hell breaks loose.\u201d\nTrue to this prediction, Lan Wangji watches with bated breath as Jin Guangshan, accompanied by Sect Leaders Yao and Ouyang, with whom he is laughing amiably, returns to the courtyard with a glass of wine, takes a single sip, and almost spits it everywhere at the sight of his legitimate son slinging his arms around the shoulders of his illegitimate half-brothers, their half-sister standing close by. Jin Guangshan goes still and red, but unlike Lan Qiren, he doesn\u2019t immediately start shouting. Instead, he excuses himself from his companions and walks slowly towards Jin Zixuan, who steps away from his siblings with a wolfish smile on his face.\nWithout exchanging a single word, Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian both choose this moment to drift closer, joined hands squeezing in mutual comfort as they come within earshot of the Jins.\n\u201cZixuan,\u201d says Jin Guangshan, his false cheer laced with an undertone of menace. \u201cI had thought you\u2019d be coming with Luo Qingyang.\u201d\n\u201cOh, she\u2019ll be here soon,\u201d says Jin Zixuan. \u201cShe and her date took a separate car.\u201d\nAnger flashes across Jin Guangshan\u2019s face, replaced by a mask of studied calm. \u201cIs that so.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d says Jin Zixuan. \u201cAs you can see, I\u2019ve brought my own companions.\u201d He smiles a dangerous smile. \u201cWould you like to meet them? I don\u2019t believe you\u2019ve ever been properly introduced.\u201d\nJin Guangshan stiffens, mouth a hard line as, nearby, Sect Leader Yao starts whispering furiously behind his hand to Sect Leader Ouyang. \u201cThat will not be necessary,\u201d he grits out. \u201cZixuan, I think we should talk in private \u2013\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d says Jin Zixuan, voice still skirting the line between silk and steel. \u201cIn fact, I think there\u2019s been quite enough privacy about certain matters lately, don\u2019t you agree? After all, Father, you were the one to teach me about the importance of transparency in business, and I wouldn\u2019t be a dutiful son if I didn\u2019t take your teachings to heart.\u201d He grins, head turning as two new arrivals step through the balloon arch. \u201cAh, here\u2019s Mianmian and her partner now!\u201d\nWei Wuxian lets out a delighted gasp, though it takes Lan Wangji an extra second to appreciate why. It\u2019s not just that Mianmian has entered with a woman on her arm; it\u2019s that the woman in question is Wen Qing, her dress as red as Mianmian\u2019s is gold, so that together, it looks like they\u2019re wearing wedding colours.\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s perfect,\u201d Wei Wuxian whispers, tugging gleefully on Lan Wangji\u2019s hand.\nLan Wangji nods and looks around for Xichen, pleased to see that his brother is smiling in welcome as Mianmian and Wen Qing approach him. It was one thing to know that Xichen had okayed their collective social rebellion plan, but after what happened with Lan Qiren, it\u2019s frankly a relief to see that he\u2019s still as calm and cheerful as ever.\n(\u201cWhat do I have to worry about?\u201d Xichen had said, back when they\u2019d first discussed it all and Lan Wangji had double-checked to make sure his brother was really okay with it. \u201cNobody is going to think I was involved. All I have to do is stand there and smile and maybe smooth things over, which won\u2019t be hard \u2013 it\u2019s my birthday, after all. Whatever lead I set, the rest of them will be obliged to follow.\u201d)\nLan Wangji loves his brother.\n\u201cWell,\u201d says Jin Guangshan, smiling rigidly. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you finding your way in the world. Please excuse me.\u201d And with that, he turns away and stalks off in the direction of the buffet, Yao and Ouyang still gossiping furiously. \u00a0\nJin Zixuan watches him go, then does a little fistpump. He turns back to his siblings, all of whom look pleased with this outcome, and then excuses himself, heading straight to Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian.\n\u201cWangji!\u201d he says, removing the aviators and tucking them carefully into the breast pocket of his (immaculate, gold-embroidered) linen suit. He pauses, flicking an amused glance as he takes in Wei Wuxian\u2019s outfit. \u201cGremlin. Nice shirt.\u201d\n\u201cPeacock. Nice face.\u201d\nJin Zixuan smiles with all his teeth, returning his attention to Lan Wangji. \u201cSorry to keep you waiting, but goddamn, that was worth it. Has your uncle already lost his mind, or is that scheduled for later?\u201d\n\u201cAlready happened,\u201d says Lan Wangji. \u201cIt was\u2026 unpleasant.\u201d\n\u201cHe made my son cry,\u201d Wei Wuxian adds, darkly. \u201cXichen had to banish him.\u201d\nJin Zixuan winces, then raises a brow. \u201cYour son, huh? So where is this mysterious cherub?\u201d\nWei Wuxian points behind him, a slight smirk on his lips. \u201cMy sister is bringing him now.\u201d\n\u201cYour sister?\u201d Jin Zixuan whips around, smoothing one hand over his perfectly gelled hair and the other down his suit. It\u2019s as close to flustered as Lan Wangji has ever seen him, and together with Jiang Yanli\u2019s earlier blush, he belatedly makes the connection. Huh.\n\u201cGege!\u201d cries A-Yuan, running from Jiang Yanli\u2019s side to hug Wei Wuxian\u2019s legs \u2013 albeit one-armed, as he\u2019s carrying a very large iced bun in his right hand. \u201cLook what I got!\u201d\nWei Wuxian smiles so wide, it\u2019s like a second sun coming out. \u201cThat looks delicious!\u201d he proclaims. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to show me and Zhan-ge where you got it.\u201d\nA-Yuan nods, then does a comic double-take as he looks to the side, a huge grin breaking out on his already icing-streaked face. \u201cQing-jie!\u201d he yells ecstatically, and promptly bolts off towards Wen Qing. She turns at the sound of her name being called and smiles as she sees A-Yuan, bending down to scoop him up into her arms. She jounces him on her hip and heads over to join them, laughing as A-Yuan waves his bun in her face.\n\u201cQingqing!\u201d says Wei Wuxian, beaming. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you\u2019d be coming!\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were, either,\u201d she says, as A-Yuan takes an oversized bite of his bun. \u201cMianmian only asked me last-minute; her original shock-the-patriarchs date broke her ankle yesterday, so I had to sub in.\u201d She looks at A-Yuan, her sharp edges softening into fondness. \u201cIt\u2019s always wonderful to see this one, though.\u201d\nShe\u2019s clearly about to say more, but pauses as she belatedly tracks the fact that Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian are still holding hands. Eyes narrowed, she fixes Lan Wangji with a gaze as sharp and assessing as a surgeon\u2019s scalpel, and he has the uncomfortable premonition that he\u2019s going to be given a shovel talk at some point in the near future.\nMercifully, Jiang Yanli chooses this moment to join their circle, smiling warmly, a touch of pink in her cheeks as Jin Zixuan makes room for her and says, just a little awkwardly, \u201cHello.\u201d\n\u201cHello,\u201d she replies, shyly ducking her head. \u201cIt\u2019s lovely to see you again.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s very lovely,\u201d Jin Zixuan says, unusually inane. \u201cI mean, uh. It\u2019s lovely for me, too, not lovely for you. I mean, it can be lovely for you, I just didn\u2019t want to assume \u2013\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d Wei Wuxian mutters.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d says Jiang Yanli, blushing fiercely now. \u201cI know what you meant.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d says Jin Zixuan, also looking somewhat pinker than usual. \u201cGood. That\u2019s \u2013 good.\u201d\nWen Qing rolls her eyes. \u201cOh, look!\u201d she says, brightly sarcastic, \u201cA distraction! Let\u2019s go and look at it, shall we?\u201d And with a pointed glance at both Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian, she strides away across the courtyard, A-Yuan still happily ensconced in her arms.\nCackling, Wei Wuxian makes the universal I\u2019m-watching-you sign at Jin Zixuan, then lets Lan Wangji pull him away, knocking their shoulders together as they follow Wen Qing.\n\u201cI\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll say it again,\u201d he says, affecting a mock-sage tone. \u201cI might be a disaster bisexual, but at least I\u2019m not straight.\u201d\nLan Wangji snorts, lips quirking, and Wei Wuxian looks insufferably pleased with himself.\nTogether, they reach Wen Qing in time to hear A-Yuan asking to be put down, as he\u2019s just seen some other small children running around on one of the grassy areas away from the main courtyard.\n\u201cGo ahead,\u201d says Wei Wuxian. \u201cJust remember to be nice!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m nice!\u201d A-Yuan insists, and trundles over to where two small boys \u2013 one a Lan disciple\u2019s child named Jingyi, the other of whom Lan Wangji vaguely recognizes as being Sect Leader Ouyang\u2019s youngest, Zizhen \u2013 are kicking around a ball. All three adults watch as A-Yuan introduces himself by offering to share his bun, tearing off two big chunks for his new friends, who immediately accept him into their game.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good kid,\u201d Wen Qing says, softly. \u201cHe reminds me so much of my brother at that age.\u201d \u00a0\n\u201cYou guys should come over for dinner again soon,\u201d says Wei Wuxian. He glances at Lan Wangji, flushes slightly, and adds, \u201cDo an official meet-the-boyfriend thing.\u201d\nInstantly, Wen Qing\u2019s laser-eyed stare is back. \u201cHmm,\u201d she says, looking pointedly at Lan Wangji, who unconsciously attempts to straighten his already-perfect posture in response to her scrutiny. \u201cPop quiz!\u201d she announces suddenly, dark eyes glittering.\nWei Wuxian groans. \u201cQingqing, you don\u2019t need to \u2013\u201d\n\u201cQuiet,\u201d she snaps \u2013 and then, to Lan Wangji, her tone sharp as a sword, \u201cWhen is Wei Ying\u2019s birthday?\u201d\nLan Wangji has known that for years. \u201cOctober 31st.\u201d\n\u201cDoes A-Yuan have any allergies?\u201d\n\u201cShellfish.\u201d (Wei Wuxian had been careful to tell him this on the drive over, in case Lan Wangji ended up supervising him around the food.)\n\u201cWhat toy does he sleep with?\u201d\n\u201cA rabbit called Moon.\u201d (The toy in question had featured in several of the texts and photos Wei Wuxian had sent him about his and A-Yuan\u2019s daily life.)\n\u201cWhen is A-Yuan\u2019s next birthday, and how old will he be?\u201d\n\u201cHe turns five on January 12th.\u201d (This had come up during the earlier conversation with Xichen about school enrolment dates, as it will make A-Yuan one of the older children in his class when he starts kindergarten.)\n\u201cDoes Wei Ying drink too much coffee?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d he says, automatically.\n\u201cHey!\u201d says Wei Wuxian, feigning hurt, just as Wen Qing says, \u201cCorrect on all counts. Last question: how long have you two been together?\u201d\n\u201cJust a couple of weeks,\u201d says Lan Wangji, unable to keep the fondness out of his tone, \u201cbut it feels like longer.\u201d\n\u201cHmm,\u201d Wen Qing says again. She looks him up and down, then tosses her hair and smiles. \u201cAll right. You can stay.\u201d\nLan Wangji bows gravely to her. \u201cThank you.\u201d\nDropping Lan Wangji\u2019s hand in order to cross his arms, Wei Wuxian glares at Wen Qing. \u201cI am standing right here.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d says Wen Qing blithely, \u201cbut that\u2019s never stopped you from being dumb about men before. Besides,\u201d she adds, ignoring Wei Wuxian\u2019s outraged splutter, \u201cI\u2019ve got A-Yuan\u2019s welfare to think about, too.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m so glad you approve,\u201d Wei Wuxian huffs.\nWen Qing grins at him. \u201cYou should be,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause on the basis of that approval, I\u2019m going to watch your son for the next, oh \u2013 forty minutes? Call it an hour, tops \u2013 while you two go and spend some child-free time together.\u201d Her smile softens. \u201cYou\u2019re a good man, Wei Ying. You deserve nice things.\u201d\nWei Wuxian turns bright red. \u201cShut up,\u201d he hisses, \u201cyou know I\u2019m allergic to compliments!\u201d\nWen Qing merely raises an eyebrow and makes a shooing motion at the pair of them. \u201cRun along!\u201d\nWei Wuxian looks like he wants to argue, but before he can get the words out, Lan Wangji links their arms together and tugs him away, nodding gratitude to Wen Qing as he does so. Her eyes spark with mischievous encouragement, and Lan Wangji decides that he likes her very much.\n\u201cBossy,\u201d Wei Wuxian grumbles, as Lan Wangji leads him onto one of the covered walkways that curves away from the courtyard. \u201cI cannot believe you\u2019re already helping her bully me! And after she grilled you, too!\u201d\n\u201cShe is merely concerned for your welfare, and that of A-Yuan,\u201d says Lan Wangji mildly. \u201cI like that in a person. And,\u201d he adds, lowering his voice, \u201cI am very much in favour of being alone with you.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d says Wei Wuxian. His smile turns playful, sultry. \u201cIs that so?\u201d\n\u201cAlways,\u201d says Lan Wangji, and as they round a convenient corner, he spins Wei Wuxian, pushes him up against the wall, and kisses him, deep and greedy.\nWei Wuxian moans into Lan Wangji\u2019s mouth, kissing back as his arms twine around his neck. Their bodies press together, Lan Wangji fitting his hands to the tantalising strip of skin left bare by Wei Wuxian\u2019s crop top, skimming up and down his sides. They lose themselves in the rhythm of it, urgent without being hurried.\n\u201cWe should break into the library,\u201d Wei Wuxian pants, grinding shamelessly against Lan Wangji\u2019s thigh. \u201cRevisit those old fantasies, huh?\u201d\nFor a moment, Lan Wangji is sorely tempted, and expresses this temptation by squeezing Wei Wuxian\u2019s hips as he kisses along his jaw. But then he shakes his head and leans in, putting his mouth to Wei Wuxian\u2019s ear.\n\u201cNot today.\u201d\nWei Wuxian groans, only somewhat in disappointment. \u201cRemember that part where I have a small child? There I things I want to do with you that absolutely require he not be present.\u201d\n\u201cWe are not,\u201d Lan Wangji murmurs, punctuating his words with a sucking kiss to Wei Wuxian\u2019s throat, \u201cgoing to fuck in the GusuLan library at my brother\u2019s birthday party.\u201d He lifts his head, body thrumming with arousal as he meets Wei Wuxian\u2019s dark-eyed gaze. \u201cI\u2019ve got a better idea.\u201d\nStraightening up, he takes a moment to orient himself, ignoring the little whine Wei Wuxian lets out as they pull apart. They\u2019re on the opposite side of the courtyard to the Jingshi, but his childhood room \u2013 which is to say, the room he still uses whenever he visits Cloud Recesses \u2013 lies in one of the smaller buildings just along the path. Somewhat importantly, it is also still a ways distant from Lan Qiren\u2019s quarters.\nTaking Wei Wuxian\u2019s hand, he proceeds to lead him there at a pace which, while not actually a run, is nonetheless swifter than usual. They don\u2019t pass anyone else en route, which is hardly surprising but still a relief, especially when they both pause to take off their shoes outside, but still, Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t fully relax again until they\u2019re safely inside his personal space with the door latched.\n\u201cThis is your room?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks, looking around. There\u2019s a playful smile on his lips as he looks at the framed, artistically black-and-white photo of Cloud Recesses rabbits that hangs on the far wall. \u201cDid you take this?\u201d\n\u201cI did,\u201d Lan Wangji admits. \u201cFor a photography contest when I was ten.\u201d\n\u201cDid you win?\u201d\n\u201cI came second.\u201d\nWei Wuxian snorts. \u201cClearly, it was rigged.\u201d\nThis is demonstrably untrue, and Lan Wangji almost points this out until he realizes he\u2019s being teased. He ducks his head, lips twitching, and says instead, \u201cClearly.\u201d\nAnd then, because he can and he wants to, he reels Wei Wuxian back in and kisses him again. Wei Wuxian melts against him, sweet and pliant at first, then growing more urgent, hands sliding from Lan Wangji\u2019s waist down to grip his ass. Lan Wangji retaliates by sucking on his bottom lip; Wei Wuxian whimpers, breathing hard when they pull apart.\n\u201cLan er-gege, please tell me your plan involves nudity.\u201d\nFor an answer, Lan Wangji strips off his shirt and then reaches for the hem of Wei Wuxian\u2019s crop top, shivering with anticipation as he pulls it gently over his head. By mutual silent decision, they each take care of their own jeans and boxers, then gravitate back to one another, Wei Wuxian laughing against his mouth as he struggles to kick off a sock.\n\u201cHah!\u201d he cries, finally freed of the offending item. He smiles at Lan Wangji, so bright and beautiful it makes his chest ache, and when Lan Wangij steps in to kiss him again, his touch is reverent.\nThey move to the bed \u2013 a double, albeit a small one, so they aren\u2019t too cramped \u2013 and lie down together, kissing as they tangle their legs. Then Wei Wuxian shifts, pulling Lan Wangji on top of him, and both of them gasp at the change in position.\n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji murmurs, rutting gently in the crease of his thigh. He kisses Wei Wuxian\u2019s cheek, his temple. \u201cA-Ying, what do you want?\u201d\n\u201cYou,\u201d breathes Wei Wuxian, running a leg down Lan Wangji\u2019s calf. He arches against him, eyes blown dark. \u201cWant you, gege.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you want me?\u201d\nWei Wuxian curls a hand around the nape of his neck, drawing him down until his mouth is pressed to the shell of Lan Wangji\u2019s ear. \u201cWant you inside me,\u201d he whispers. \u201cA-Zhan, please?\u201d\n\u201cAnything,\u201d Lan Wangji rasps, and kisses him until they\u2019re both breathless. Only when they\u2019re both gasping for air does he pull back, lean his weight up on his elbows and reach over to the nightstand, where he keeps lube and condoms.\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re prepared, I like that,\u201d says Wei Wuxian, grinning as he folds his arms behind his head. \u201cThough I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d ever have brought a boy here before.\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t,\u201d Lan Wangji admits. \u201cBut there\u2019s a club in Caiyi Town, and sometimes I\u2019d go there when I was home from university and Uncle was away on business. Not often, but\u2026 as you say, I like to be prepared.\u201d\n\u201cI love preparedness,\u201d Wei Wuxian purrs, letting his legs fall even more open than they were already. Heat flares in Lan Wangji\u2019s gut; he prowls his way down Wei Wuxian\u2019s body, kissing his pec, the cut of his hip, sucking a gentle mark onto the inside of his thigh as he lifts it up, resting Wei Wuxian\u2019s right knee on his shoulder. As he opens the lube, Wei Wuxian makes a breathless noise and tips his head back. \u201cPreparedness is so good, I can\u2019t believe that I have never, until this moment, experienced true prepar- ohhhhhh fuuuuck.\u201d\nLan Wangji smirks, crooking his slippery finger a few more times before adding a second. Wei Wuxian pushes into it, urging him on with the flex of his hips and thighs, which only makes Lan Wangji go slower, arousal building in him with each panted noise he wrings from Wei Wuxian.\n\u201cLan Zhan, I swear, if you keep teasing \u2013\u201d\n\u201cWould never tease Wei Ying,\u201d he murmurs smugly, choosing this moment to withdraw his fingers. Wei Wuxian groans, trembling with impatience and arousal as Lan Wangji gets the condom on. He huffs, shifts his weight, and slowly guides himself in, shutting his eyes against the overwhelming sensation of Wei Wuxian around him, hot and tight, the scent and sound of him.\n\u201cA-Zhan, Lan er-gege,\u201d Wei Wuxian gasps, and Lan Wangji\u2019s eyes snap open again, helpless to look away from Wei Wuxian\u2019s beautiful gaze. He pushes forward, bracing his arms beneath Wei Wuxian\u2019s thighs as he folds him in half, and kisses him when he\u2019s fully seated, a shallow brush of mouths that nonetheless steals the breath from him.\n\u201cA-Ying,\u201d he says, and then he starts to fuck him, steady thrusts to build a rhythm that soon turns staccato as Wei Wuxian whines and bucks and bows beneath him, grabbing at the nape of his neck and pulling him down to pant obscenities in his ear.\n\u201cSo good, gege, so sweet to me, so much \u2013 ah! fuck, oh, please, like that, like that \u2013\u201d \u00a0\nIt\u2019s almost too much in the best way possible. Lan Wangji all but growls as he snaps his hips, bending his head to suck a fresh hickey high up Wei Wuxian\u2019s neck. Wei Wuxian makes an exquisite noise in response, high and desperate.\n\u201cCan you come like this?\u201d Lan Wangji asks, biting at the edge of his jaw. \u201cCome just from me in you?\u201d\n\u201cOh fuck,\u201d Wei Wuxian gasps, \u201coh fuck, Lan Zhan, Lan Zhan, please \u2013\u201d\n\u201cA-Ying,\u201d he whispers back, and Wei Wuxian arches up, makes a gorgeous throaty noise and comes, his whole body clenching down like a vise. Lan Wangji swears and fucks into him deeper, riding him through the aftershocks as Wei Wuxian shudders from overstimulation, making little punched-out sounds that soon have Lan Wangji coming in turn, ears ringing from the force of it.\nGasping, Lan Wangji devotes the last of his brainpower to gently pulling out, tying off the condom and throwing it in the trash. Only then does he collapse along Wei Wuxian\u2019s side, tucking an arm around his waist and pulling him close as sweat cools on their bodies.\nWei Wuxian makes a contented noise and burrows back against him. Lan Wangji kisses the nape of his neck, breathing in their scent as his heartrate steadily slows. He shuts his eyes and drowses, satiated and content. Wei Wuxian does likewise, at least for a minute or two; then he rolls over, pillowing his head on Lan Wangji\u2019s chest, fingers trailing idly along his stomach.\n\u201cLan Zhan?\u201d\n\u201cMn?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sweaty.\u201d\n\u201cMn.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m so sweaty, I don\u2019t think I can get my jeans back on like this.\u201d\n\u201cSo walk out naked,\u201d Lan Wangji mumbles, pressing a kiss to Wei Wuxian\u2019s hair.\nWei Wuxian laughs, delighted. \u201cSo shameless, Lan Zhan!\u201d\n\u201cMn.\u201d\nA featherlight kiss is dropped on his cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re adorable like this, you know. The world\u2019s most beautiful caveman, rendered non-verbal by the power of sex.\u201d\nThis doesn\u2019t seem entirely fair, but Lan Wangji is too content to argue. \u201cMn.\u201d\n\u201cLan Zhan, did I break you? I hope so, because I\u2019m not sure my legs work anymore.\u201d\n\u201cMouth still works fine.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe you\u2019ll have to wear it out, too.\u201d\nLan Wangji cracks an eye open at this, and is met with the full force of Wei Wuxian\u2019s soft, sly smile. Making an enormous effort, he lifts a hand and traces Wei Wuxian\u2019s plush, red lips with a fingertip, brain coming partially back online with the sharp inhale this earns him. He smirks, then uses the hand to cup Wei Wuxian\u2019s cheek, guiding him in for a soft kiss.\n\u201cMaybe later,\u201d he murmurs.\nWei Wuxian hides his face in Lan Wangji\u2019s shoulder. \u201cStop being so nice, you\u2019ll set a bad precedent. I\u2019ll start to expect this sort of thing!\u201d\n\u201cShould always expect it,\u201d Lan Wangji says, looping Wei Wuxian\u2019s hair behind his ear. He pauses, thinking. \u201cWe\u2019re both sweaty.\u201d\n\u201cVery,\u201d Wei Wuxian grumbles.\n\u201cWould you like a shower?\u201d\nWei Wuxian perks up instantly. \u201cI would love a shower.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s one next door, between this room and the one that used to be Xichen\u2019s.\u201d He curves a possessive hand over Wei Wuxian\u2019s hip, stroking the bone. \u201cOf course, we\u2019d have to go into the hallway naked. Anyone might see.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a chance I\u2019m willing to take.\u201d\n\u201cMn,\u201d says Lan Wangji, and pulls him back in for another luxurious kiss.\nThe hallway is empty when they sneak to the shower, and presumably remains so, as nobody comes to bang on the door and demand to know what they\u2019re doing in there. Under different circumstances, Lan Wangji would happily keep Wei Wuxian in the shower until they\u2019d both recovered enough to go a second round, but he\u2019s conscious of the fact that, even if Xichen won\u2019t object to their absence, Wen Qing is still donating her time to mind A-Yuan \u2013 something she might be kind enough to do again in the future, provided they don\u2019t abuse her patience this first time around.\nEven so, it\u2019s difficult to resist touching as much of Wei Wuxian as he can, slick hands stroking sides and arms as they kiss beneath the spray. Inevitably, they start to get aroused again, but by that point, they\u2019re both aware of the time and agree, albeit reluctantly, to return to the party.\nSnagging a pair of clean towels from the rack, Lan Wangji hands one to Wei Wuxian and leads him back to the bedroom, where they somehow manage to get dried and dressed without falling back into bed again, despite taking multiple breaks to kiss each other up against various surfaces. When they\u2019re finally done, they leave the towels in the hamper, and as Wei Wuxian straightens his necklace and fixes his hair in the dresser mirror, grinning cheekily at his own reflection, Lan Wangji feels his whole chest expand with emotion. This is the room where his teenage self fantasised about teenage Wei Wuxian; where he later sat crying quiet tears the day he heard his uncle decry homosexuals and realized, for the first time, that this meant him. This is the room where he decided not to tell Xichen the truth of himself; where he shakily planned that first, illicit visit to the gay club in Caiyi Town.\nAnd now it is also a room where he has slept with Wei Wuxian (where we made love, the long-stifled voice of his inner romantic thinks, to the anxious, yearning embarrassment of the rest of him), thereby bringing the whole thing full circle, like closing a circuit he never knew was open.\n\u201cHey,\u201d says Wei Wuxian, voice soft and worried. He\u2019s moved away from the mirror, resting a hand to Lan Wangji\u2019s cheek, eyes gentle with concern. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\nLan Wangji manages a tremulous smile and leans in to kiss him, short and sweet. \u201cI\u2019ve never been better,\u201d he says, and is startled by how much he means it. He links their hands, amazed all over again that he gets to have this. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s go and eat, and see what A-Yuan is up to.\u201d\nOut on the verandah, they reclaim their shoes without anyone noticing. Wei Wuxian pokes out his tongue as he fiddles with his bootlaces, and when he straightens up again, Lan Wangji is moved to put an arm around his waist, snugging him close as they start to walk.\nWei Wuxian laughs, his cheeks still pleasantly flushed from the shower. \u201cReally, Lan Zhan. So shameless!\u201d\n\u201cNothing about this is shameful,\u201d Lan Wangji says, and thrills to think that any part of him maybe, finally believes it.\nWei Wuxian looks at him, realizes he\u2019s serious, then smiles his full, bright, beautiful smile and puts his arm around his waist in turn.\nWhen they walk back out to the courtyard, the music is still playing, and there are even more guests present than there were before, many of whom are now eating as well as talking, occupying the tables and chairs set up outside the main hall. Most importantly, however, Jingyi and Zizhen, who are supervised by their mothers, are still playing happily with A-Yuan, who is supervised by both Wen Qing and Mianmian. The two women are seated on the grass, Wen Qing braced on her palms with Mianmian\u2019s head in her lap, and Lan Wangji has the sudden realization that perhaps he isn\u2019t the only one here who caught feelings for a supposedly fake date.\n\u201cWelcome back,\u201d says Wen Qing, looking them over with affectionate suspicion. A corner of her mouth ticks up as she takes a theatrical glance at her watch. \u201cAnd you even made it in under an hour! I\u2019m honestly impressed.\u201d\n\u201cWhat can I say?\u201d says Wei Wuxian. \u201cEnthusiasm makes the job go faster.\u201d\nMianmian snorts, swaying langorously upright to smile at Lan Wangji. \u201cHello, failed fianc\u00e9 the first.\u201d\n\u201cHello,\u201d he says, gravely. He tips his head to indicate both Wen Qing and Mianmian\u2019s intimate proximity to her. \u201cWho knew we had so much in common?\u201d\nMianmian pokes out her tongue. \u201cOh, shut up,\u201d she says, throwing a small clump of grass at him. \u201cStill, if they\u2019d put a gun to our heads, I would\u2019ve chosen you over Zixuan.\u201d\nWei Wuxian groans. \u201cPlease tell that to my sister. She actually likes him, it\u2019s horrible.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s welcome to him,\u201d says Mianmian, leaning back to grin at Wen Qing. \u201cIt leaves more sensible women for the rest of us.\u201d\nAlmost imperceptibly, Wen Qing blushes. \u201cHush,\u201d she says. \u201cA-Yuan is coming.\u201d\nSure enough, A-Yuan is barreling towards them, Jingyi and Zizhen hot on his heels. \u201cGege!\u201d he shouts. \u201cZhan-ge! We\u2019re playing space planes!\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d says Wei Wuxian, laughing as A-Yuan spreads his arms out and veers off from the adults, zig-zagging as Jingyi starts to make gun strafing noises in mock-attack. He watches the children dash off again, then turns back to Wen Qing. \u201cSeeing as we\u2019re still within the hour, do you mind watching him a little longer while we get some food? I\u2019ve worked up quite an appetite!\u201d\n\u201cI bet you have,\u201d she mutters. A good three seconds passes, during which time Wei Wuxian makes puppy-dog eyes, before Wen Qing heaves a long-suffering sigh and flicks a magnanimous hand towards the buffet. \u201cGo. Eat.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the best, Qing-jie,\u201d says Wei Wuxian, beaming.\n\u201cCorrect,\u201d she says dryly \u2013 and then, to Lan Wangji, \u201cCongratulations! It\u2019s now your official responsibility to make sure he eats a vegetable every so often. I resign my duties to you from here on in.\u201d She tips her head back, smiling at the sky. \u201cAh, freedom!\u201d\n\u201cI changed my mind, you\u2019re the worst,\u201d says Wei Wuxian, and promptly tugs Lan Wangji away before he can reply.\nThey\u2019re almost to the main hall when Jin Zixuan appears in front of them, arms crossed and an extremely judgmental look on his face. He scans the pair of them, lip curling.\n\u201cYou actually snuck off and fucked, didn\u2019t you,\u201d he says accusingly. \u201cWangji! Have you no pride?\u201d\nLan Wangji feels his ears heat up. \u201cYou have no proof of that.\u201d\n\u201cNo proof? No proof? You\u2019ve both got wet hair and the gremlin is missing an earring!\u201d\nWei Wuxian lifts a hand to his ear and swears. \u201cIt must\u2019ve come off in your room.\u201d\n\u201cIn his bed, more likely,\u201d mutters Jin Zixuan.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s my sister?\u201d asks Wei Wuxian, evidently deciding that the best defense is a good offence. \u201cDid you run out of things to talk about, or has she just come to her senses?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s talking to your brother,\u201d says Jin Zixuan, his attempt at hauteur somewhat ruined by his suddenly red cheeks. \u201cI was going to bring her some cake.\u201d\n\u201cLan Zhan!\u201d says Wei Wuxian, suddenly looking upset. \u201cWe missed them cutting the cake?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d replies Lan Wangji, touched by the concern. \u201cXichen\u2019s never liked that part of birthday, and neither have I. We just put the cake out at a certain point and let people help themselves.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d says Wei Wuxian, visibly relieved. Then he brightens. \u201cThat means I can get cake, too!\u201d\n\u201cLunch first, then cake.\u201d\n\u201cA-Zhan, Wen Qing was joking! You don\u2019t really have to supervise my food, I\u2019m perfectly capable \u2013\u201d\nLan Wangji kisses his cheek, which proves to be a startlingly effective method of shutting Wei Wuxian up. \u201cLunch first,\u201d he says again, \u201cthen cake.\u201d\n\u201cUgh, fine,\u201d says Wei Wuxian, blushing to the roots of his hair. \u201cBut I\u2019m having two slices, and you can\u2019t stop me!\u201d And with that, he pokes his tongue out at Jin Zixuan and bounds ahead to help himself to the buffet, leaving Lan Wangji alone with his friend.\nJin Zixuan raises an eyebrow. \u201cThat\u2019s really what does it for you? Him?\u201d\n\u201cJust think,\u201d says Lan Wangji serenely. \u201cIf things go well with Jiang Yanli, he\u2019ll be your brother-in-law.\u201d\n\u00a0Jin Zixuan opens his mouth. Closes it again. \u201cAh,\u201d he says.\n\u201cMn.\u201d\nThey start to move slowly towards the hall, the scent of food rekindling Lan Wangji\u2019s appetite.\n\u201cYour uncle,\u201d says Jin Zixuan, softly. \u201cWas he really that bad?\u201d\n\u201cHe was.\u201d\n\u201cFuck. I\u2019m sorry. This was my plan, after all.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be,\u201d says Lan Wangji. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d\nThey pause on the threshold, watching as Wei Wuxian, who is already at the buffet table, helps himself a frankly unnecessary number of egg rolls.\n\u201cWangji?\u201d\n\u201cHm?\u201d\nJin Zixuan smirks. \u201cCongrats on the sex.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d says Lan Wangji. \u201cPlease never say that again.\u201d\n\u201cPerish the thought.\u201d He claps Lan Wangji on the shoulder. \u201cAll right! I need cake for Yanli. Go make sure your gremlin doesn\u2019t choke on an egg roll.\u201d\n\u201cNot in public, certainly,\u201d says Lan Wangji, and steps away with the sound of Jin Zixuan\u2019s disgusted protests ringing in his ears.\nApparently, Wei Wuxian is already rubbing off on him.\nGood, he thinks, impossibly fond, and goes to join his boyfriend at the buffet.\u00a0\u00a0"
