    "text": "Newton Scamander was a curious sort, Percival Graves decided after a long time spent reading reports and files on the British wizard. Scamander was all gangly limbs and shy awkwardness that belied a core of iron and gold. Polite and well-mannered, the magizoologist was painfully earnest, almost naive at times, in such a way that had Graves' whole being cringing in sympathy.\nBut, even with the naivety Scamander exuded, the magizoologist still had a somewhat impressive resume for someone so young. His conduct during the Great War spoke of a competent combatant, creative, and innovative. The paragraphs of magically blacked-out words inferred that the younger Scamander had been involved in a number of important battles, non of which Graves had the clearance to even know the\u00a0names\u00a0of. Even some of the dates had been blacked out, and those that remained visible to Graves as the Head Auror of MACUSA told him that Newton Scamander had been present for some of the most decisive battles of the Great War. All of this painted a picture of Newton Scamander as accomplished, skilled, and confident, yet the reports from Graves' own aurors\u00a0suggested the man was also very awkward and shy; even socially inept.\u00a0\nThe dichotomy was jarring.\nGraves only had second-hand accounts of the magizoologist to rely upon for his assessment of Newton Scamander and it made his attempt to understand the magizoologist harder still. Even pensived memories weren't the most reliable; the person whose memories they were inadvertently provided their own perceptual limitations to the memory. In this case, one of the department clerks had observed Scamander and her memory showed only a nervous, polite, young man who seemed to struggle talking to anyone, let alone a pretty witch.\nThe non-war related information Graves had on Scamander suggested the magizoologist was a chaotic person who had been a troubled youth that eventually matured to become just as good in combat as his war hero, Auror-trained brother. To top it off, Scamander then chose an\u00a0entirely new profession\u00a0instead of a safe, stable position in the British Ministry or even as a private zoo hand, as an international magizoologist; studying magical creatures the world over and acting as a one-man cause dedicated to dismantling the magical animal trade. Apparently, Scamander had been\u00a0commissioned\u00a0to write a book about magical creatures which was what led Newton Scamander to New York and the encounter that revealed Grindelwald had been impersonating Graves for months.\nHow all of that combined to create the Newton Scamander that every single one of his aurors saw as\u00a0not a threat, absolutely boggled Graves' mind. This magizoologist, who\u2014by all accounts\u2014should\u00a0have been imposing, demanding of respect, and outwardly as confident as his elder brother just\u2026\u00a0wasn't.\nScamander, in short, was a contradiction that drove Graves' to distraction.\u00a0\nPercival Graves did\u00a0not\u00a0like it when people were not possible to easily deduce the motivations of and categorise accordingly.\u00a0\nUltimately, Graves' initial opinion of the magizoologist was built from second-hand comments, reports, and the pensive memories of a variety of aurors from Graves' own department. Newton Scamander seemed painfully unremarkable in those memories, the reports\u2014dry and dull in the way official documents tended to be\u2014lent little in the way of determining the character and skills the young Brit possessed. It all served to paint two contradictory characters for Newton Scamander to possess; neither complimenting the other, either.\nIf Graves passed Scamander on the street he doubted he'd have considered him as anything more remarkable than any other wizard; the young magizoologist seemed to be so generic and forgettable save for his distinctive blue coat.\nA blue coat that Graves had heard\u00a0rumours about.\nIn truth, it had been surprising for Graves to learn that Grindelwald's capture had been down solely to this one person\u2014a\u00a0civilian\u00a0no less\u2014along with a disgraced ex-auror, a no-maj and a case full of illegal creatures. The blacked-out sections of Scamander's British Ministry file\u00a0hinted\u00a0towards this surprise of Graves' as being disingenuous, but hardly anything was known of the younger Scamander brother. And he hadn't known Scamander had a secret, war related, highly classified file until\u00a0after\u00a0he had learned who caught Grindelwald.\u00a0\nCompared to the well-known, skilled Auror vaunted as a war hero, elder brother of Newton Scamander, the magizoologist was practically invisible. Well, until recently, that was.\nGraves could judge his own presumptions about Newton Scamander all he liked, but what surprised him more was the fact that\u00a0Serephina\u00a0permitted the magizoologist to remain in New York\u00a0not\u00a0under house arrest.\nOr in a secure cell.\nEspecially\u00a0considering the case the magizoologist had in his possession and what it contained. Graves had never known Seraphina to skirt a topic quite so juicy as a civilian with illegal creatures that he didn't have permits for. Not even if she technically owed said civilian for the capture of a dark wizard that had infiltrated her inner circle. Graves had also never known her to be so\u2026\u00a0relaxed\u00a0when such law-breaking occurred. Especially, right in front of her if the reports from the tunnel were accurate.\nWhatever Seraphina had decided she owed Newton Scamander, Graves hoped the younger Scamander brother understood how\u00a0lucky\u00a0he was. Seraphina paid her debts without trying to twist out of them like others who had held her illustrious position as President of MACUSA. Had Scamander experienced the attitude of whom Seraphina had succeeded as President... Well, Graves doubted he'd still have his job and Scamander any of his animals.\u00a0\nPrivately, Graves wondered whether Seraphina considered Graves' own revelation as a hostage of Grindelwald for months by Scamander\u2014months in which she had failed to realise what Newton Scamander revealed within days of his arrival in New York\u2014as part of her debt to the magizoologist. It felt arrogant of him to think his own situation influenced Seraphina's tolerance of the younger Scamander's profession, and presence in New York still but\u2026 well, Seraphina was\u00a0very\u00a0loyal to those whom she cared for.\u00a0\nThey had known each other for a long time and Graves had always supported her. It wasn't a stretch to think her leniency with Scamander was partly influenced by her and Graves' long friendship.\u00a0\nGraves just found it a little bit awkward to think overly long about.\u00a0\nOf course, that begged the question whether Newton Scamander\u00a0knew\u00a0this about Seraphina. If he did, then his lack of using it for leverage was a point in the magizoologist's favour. If he didn't\u2026 well, it didn't matter really.\u00a0\nIn the end, none of Graves' humming and hawwing about the younger Scamander mattered overly much. Not when the magizoologist was only in New York again for Grindelwald's trial. According to rumours among aurors\u2019 across the globe, the magizoologist had been travelling through the South Pacific for the last six months. With Grindelwald's trial dragging the magizoologist to New York again, Graves had the perfect opportunity to speak to the man who had ultimately saved his life. A year after the fact.\u00a0\nThe letter in his hand offered him the perfect opportunity to meet the man whose brother was a renowned auror and war hero whom Graves had met during the Great War. Perhaps they were more alike than Graves assumed; they must be for Scamander the younger to have fought Grindelwald and survived when Graves himself had been bested.\nTheseus Scamander, Graves knew, would have struggled just as Graves had, but he had no doubt the elder Scamander would have figured\u00a0something\u00a0out if he'd been in Graves' position. Both Scamander brothers, as far as Graves could figure, seemed adept at creative thinking; though Theseus, at least, had auror training to channel his creativity through. Morgana knew what Newton Scamander channelled\u00a0his\u00a0creativity through.\nProbably some chaotic animal-related behavioural process.\u00a0\nRegardless, Graves would have the chance to find out soon enough. Grindelwald's trial loomed. Duty called, and the chance to learn just what it was that was so remarkable about Newton Scamander was an alluring opportunity for him. To meet the man that had helped put a stop to a madman's desire to start a magical war\u2026 Well, Graves considered that\u00a0very\u00a0therapeutic, even if the healer he was currently under the care of might disagree.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNewt hated the hustle and bustle of the Woolworth Building and the endless activity of the MACUSA\u2014it was all too loud, too messy, and too full of humans for his tastes. Busy with their work and not as observant as government officials ought to be of potential danger when there had been a dark wizard\u00a0impersonating\u00a0one of their upper members of government for months not even a year ago. It was rather atrocious, actually, and Newt doubted Thee would be all that impressed with these witches and wizards for not paying attention to their surroundings.\nActually, Thee would probably be angered enough to give the MACUSA auror department a headache about the laxness. Newt bit back an amused snort.\u00a0'Condolences to them,'\u00a0he thought. His brother could be a right bastard about things sometimes.\u00a0\nAt least the security for the building\u00a0itself\u00a0had been improved; detection charms woven expertly into the stone of the doorways and runes etched into every surface that could safely have them to deter deception. It wasn't\u00a0quite\u00a0as extensive as Newt thought it would have been, but perhaps there were other safety measures not so easily detectable to others like Newt.\u00a0\nOr, more likely, there was a second layer to the security that kicked in once a threat was detected by the detection and anti-deception protection.\u00a0\nNewt hadn't had any issue with them, of course, but he also understood the nature of the runes used which, perhaps, might be something that might be a problem for the building's security. Runes were perfect, after all, and if one possessed a good knowledge of runes\u2014and multiple rune sets\u2014then they could be countered well enough. There were a number of ways to counteract Runic Protections if one was knowledgeable enough in the art.\u00a0\nAlthough, it was a moot point really, since Newt had no wish to impersonate a member of MACUSA's government which likely had made his entry into the building easier; runes notwithstanding.\nIt was unfortunate that he had to be here, again, when Newt had spent the last six months\u2014after the week at home with his mother fussing over him and Thee shouting at him\u00a0and\u00a0the Ministry for trying to put him on house arrest\u2014in the South Pacific. He hadn't wanted to leave but an official summons wasn't something Newt could ignore; not in the least because it pertained to a\u00a0very\u00a0public trial of a dark wizard.\nA dark wizard he'd helped reveal and capture. No, Newt no choice but to show up for the trial even if he wished to be hiding in a rainforest instead. Or his case.\u00a0\nOh gods, what he\u00a0wouldn't\u00a0do to be able to hide in his case until he could depart instead of having to hang around MACUSA. Unfortunately however, it seemed life had other ideas.\nIt usually did for Newt.\u00a0\nThe President of MACUSA happened upon him in the foyer of the Woolworth Building not five minutes after he'd entered and greeted him with the brusqueness of a powerful woman with a lot of things to do in a short time.\n\"Mister Scamander.\"\u00a0\nThe Madame President's voice was level even if she sounded brusque. Calm and quietly powerful in a way that reminded Newt of his mother when she was facing the hippogriffs, the MACUSA President exuded an air of controlled patience that drew focus upon her in any room she entered. There was even a trace of fondness in the voice that, despite the strangeness of Picquery's accent.\nNewt allowed himself to relax a little as he picked up on that trace of fondness, not too much, though. He didn't know if he could trust President Picquery or MACUSA after all. He was only in New York again because he had been summoned as a witness for Grindelwald's trial and Newt was under no illusion that he was\u00a0welcome.\nNot when he actively undermined MACUSA's creature policy with every breath he took. And a few he didn't.\u00a0\nNewt was as alert as ever and twice as sharp. His weight rested on the balls of his feet just enough for swift movement if required, his arms loose and shoulders sloped back ever so slightly. It was the pose he usually adopted when he was in a situation that could potentially explode into combat; or rapid escape with an injured creature.\u00a0\n\"Madam President,\" Newt greeted the head of MACUSA, head canted to the side. He let his gaze flit around the President's form, seemingly nervous, while taking stock of her body language. He paid attention to her wand hand, where there was a slight shimmer to her robe sleeve that told him where she holstered her wand for quick access. He kept his head low, tipped forward enough for his fringe to hide the sharpness of his gaze.\u00a0\nThe lowering of his gaze to avoid eye contact was doubly effective; it avoided any risk of legilimency used against him, just as it gave the implicit impression that Newt was weaker than he truly was. The avoidance of eye contact when meeting a predatory creature was dependent on the circumstances but Newt had learned early on that it was effective at avoiding notice, unnecessary focus on his person, and made them more prone to dismiss him as a threat. It was the fault of others for assuming Newt wasn't as great a threat because he avoided eye contact, but he couldn't really fault them for instinctive judgements based on behaviour signifiers; not when he purposefully encouraged the misapprehension..\nWell, it was good for dealing with some of his more\u00a0aggressive\u00a0animals anyway. And for people who needed to think him not a threat before he could be in a position to act to save an injured Shangyang from being used to drown a village in the 'way' of progress.\u00a0\n\"We are in your debt Mister Scamander,\" President Picquery said, fixing Newt with a level stare he avoided by not looking up at her. \"If you hadn't suspected Auror Graves to be an imposter, I would never have got my auror back and Grindelwald would have an Obscurial in his possession. He would also remain at large and a threat to the Statute.\"\n\"T-thank you Madam President but I, I didn't really do much,\" Newt replied softly, ducking his head in real embarrassment. He didn't necessarily\u00a0trust\u00a0the MACUSA President to be completely honest with her thanks, but that didn't mean he knew how to avoid the implication of praise for his actions.\nNewt did so hate being praised for things; even his mother sometimes had to hold her tongue when Newt recounted his travels to her at Christmas. She often praised him for helping the creatures he encountered; it never failed to make him blush and stammer at her proud smile every time.\nNewt could feel President Picquery's gaze on him, sharp and penetrating. Heavy.\nHe found it surprisingly difficult to not instinctively look up and meet her gaze. There was no magical compulsion to explain the difficulty; it was simply that President Picquery seemed to register on Newt's senses as someone to both avoid and also meet head on. He hated it when he came across such people.\nDuality in a person really did drain Newt's limited capacity to handle people.\u00a0\n\"Perhaps,\" she said non-committally with a flatness to her tone that\u00a0finally\u00a0had Newt look at her.\u00a0\nHe raised his head enough to meet her gaze from beneath his fringe, bright blue meeting dark brown with a sparking of pride and acknowledgement of an equal challenger. Newt blinked and pushed the instinct causing his back to straighten and gaze to sharpen\u00a0down down down\u00a0until he was as non-threatening as possible even with meeting the MACUSA President's gaze.\u00a0\n\"But your actions\u00a0did\u00a0help prevent a magical war here, Mister Scamander,\" President Picquery continued firmly, \"and for that we owe you much.\"\nAh. So that was it. President Picquery wanted Newt to\u00a0know\u00a0that he was owed a debt by her for his actions. He relaxed a little more in the foyer of the Woolworth Building. There was an implicit understanding between the MACUSA President and magizoologist that was predicated on the recognition that Newt had done something others hadn't and hadn't actually asked for payment for it. She was reminding him of that at the same time as reinstating her own influence and power as the President of an entire magical government.\u00a0\nHe could ask for anything from her and she'd grant it, her inference said, but whatever he asked for had better not be\u00a0too\u00a0much\u00a0or she'd find a way to make use of him some way.\u00a0\nLikely, President Picquery probably wanted to make use of Newt for some reason or other regardless. The British Ministry had become quite jealous of Newt helping other ministries since Grindelwald's capture.\u00a0\nIt was funny, what a bit of fame did for a person. Unfortunately, Newt had no time for that sort of pandering and political arguing.\u00a0\nAll he'd really wanted to do was release Frank and not cause trouble.\nHe'd managed\u00a0one\u00a0of those things at least.\nNewt ducked his head, cheeks warm as he smiled slightly and flicked his gaze around the MACUSA President without lingering on her form.\n\"Tina- Uh, Miss Goldstein helped,\" he pointed out quietly. Newt saw the way President Picquery nodded her head at his words from beneath his fringe; just long enough to obscure others' view of his eyes without impeding his own vision.\u00a0\nNewt had contemplated cutting it once, not long after he started travelling, before he'd been caught by a pair of amateur smugglers through his own foolishness. They'd tied him up and squabbled over what to do with him while they'd thought him 'unconscious' and his fringe had prevented them from seeing he had been awake the entire time and watching while planning his escape. That had ended with the pair\u00a0mysteriously\u00a0delivered to the nearest aurors\u2019 office in the area with a note detailing their criminal actions; sans animals of course.\u00a0\nAs creatures with biopic vision, Newt knew that humans were capable of focusing on prey or predator alike easily, more so when the subject of their attention was just as focused on them in return. It was one of the reasons he utilised his fringe to disrupt the reciprocal habit people had to return a gaze upon them with their own. Still, it always amazed Newt how so few people ever considered the sheer\u00a0brilliance\u00a0of biopic vision; especially when so many magical creatures shared this trait compared to the variety in visual systems in non-magical animals.\n\"Auror\u00a0Goldstein has been given a commendation for her actions, Mister Scamander.\"\u00a0\nNewt couldn't help the smile that he let grow\u00a0 at the news that Tina was an auror again. She certainly deserved the recognition and apology after what Grindelwald had done during his time impersonating her superior.\n\"Oh, well that's- that's uh, good.\" Newt gave a half-shrug, glancing up at Picquery who raised an elegant eyebrow at him. He wasn't all that sure what he was supposed to say in response to the news, not to the President of MACUSA, at least. With Tina or Queenie, he'd be much less candid.\n\"I don't give meaningless praise, Mister Scamander,\" President Picquery said, voice quieter and Newt's head rose at the change, his eyes locking with the MACUSA President's own and holding her gaze. This was clearly not a moment for pretending to be weak; the President, once again, was\u00a0making a point.\u00a0\"I am even less prone to turning a blind eye to certain\u00a0things.\"\nNewt's gaze narrowed for a moment, easily picking up on what President Picquery was implying, before he looked away again and inclined his head.\n\"Thank you for that,\" he murmured with genuine gratitude in his voice.\nSilence fell between them, the noise of the MACUSA muffled though Newt knew neither of them had cast a muffling charm. Not intentionally at least.\nOops.\n\"Grindelwald's trial will be held when your Ministry's Officials arrive this Tuesday, Mister Scamander,\" President Picquery said suddenly and Newt's eyes flicked up to her face, cataloguing her features before darting away. \"I believe you are aware that your attendance is expected as you are a witness to Grindelwald's activities before his reveal?\"\nIt was couched as a question but Newt could feel the expectation President Picquery had of his attendance. At least he understood now why he hadn't been given permission to leave yet. He supposed that MACUSA didn't want to use pensived memories as testimonies, or actual witness statements.\u00a0\nAnnoying, but not entirely unreasonable.\n\"I- Uh yes. Yes, I received an owl yesterday.\" Newt's eyes flickered around the expanse of the MACUSA lobby, taking in the various witches and wizards passing them quickly. \"A follow-up to the summons last week.\"\n\"Very good, Mister Scamander,\" President Picquery said, shifting and Newt's eyes locked onto the movement, head still angled down, hair hiding his eyes. He saw the way the Madam President moved, weight shifting as she prepared to leave. \"I will let you return to the Law Enforcement department where Auror Jones will take your statement to be used in the trial.\"\n\"Yes. Of course, Madam President.\" Newt nodded, shifting and half-turning away before the MACUSA President had even taken a step away from him. It was a risky move, to move away from a predator, but Newt was banking on Picquery's own pressing schedule to allow him to escape any further chit-chat.\n\"Good day Mister Scamander,\" Madam Picquery said curtly, turning on her heel and striding away from Newt as he moved away from the centre of the lobby, shoulders relaxing when he had a wall against his back.\nHe sighed quietly, head raising to survey the room, aware that he was all but invisible to the people milling about now. Newt had worked long and hard to make sure he never exuded any sort of powerful air, no aura that would draw unnecessary attention to him.\nMore often than not, such an ability served him well when approaching injured animals\u2014especially predators who'd sense any sort of powerful air and consider it a threat\u2014and Newt had found it worked quiet well with other humans; magical and muggle alike. If they didn't sense anything powerful\u2014\u00a0dangerous\u00a0\u2014about him, then it was far easier for them to disregard him and his presence.\u00a0\nUsually, it'd come back to bite them on the proverbial arse later but, well, that was to Newt's benefit and their detriment.\nTheseus had joked once that it was Newt's most dangerous quality; the ability to seem harmless when he was quite the opposite. Newt simply considered it wise, especially since he believed his coat was more than a good enough warning that others ought to be wary of him.\nIt wasn't his fault so few humans paid little attention to the meaning of colours.\nThe trial for Grindelwald was going to be\u2026 well,\u00a0trying. Newt had no illusions that the reaction to his exploits in America would have been met with amazed disbelief in the Ministry. Even with his exploits during the Great War, Newt was under no illusion that the Ministry considered his penchant for magizoology to be a waste and, quite likely, thought him mad to waste his 'skills' on beast protection. It was a common enough view of him that Newt often just ignored it.\u00a0\nWith Grindelwald's trial, of course, there would be\u00a0questions\u00a0for him. It was fortunate, perhaps, that Newt could count on the British Ministry and MACUSA both likely not wanting to make it\u00a0too\u00a0public knowledge that a non-auror was the key to the dark wizard's capture. He also had no illusions that Theseus was going to rant at him for\u00a0\"picking a fight with a dark wizard like Grindelwald without any back-up\"\u00a0because obviously Thee would consider only\u00a0himself\u00a0to be suitable back-up for such a duel. It had been bad enough when Newt had gone home for that week and Thee had waylaid him.\u00a0\nNewt skirted the perimeter of the lobby, disappearing down the steps towards the Law Enforcement department where he knew Tina was already hard at work. Maybe he'd be able to speak to her before he gave Auror Jones his statement? It'd be nice to see a kind face.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Ministry Official that porkeyed in was one that knew nothing of Newt personally\u2014only able to go on office gossip and old school stories to build his perception of what type of person Newt Scamander was\u2014and had already assumed that the magizoologist had been only a witness to Grindelwald's capture. They lacked the necessary clearance to even know Newt's war file even\u00a0existed, let alone be able to read it. The two aurors who accompanied him however knew quite different. Newt's war record wasn't for public viewing and even in-Ministry, it was kept to the upper echelons for a\u00a0reason.\u00a0\nSeveral of them, actually.\u00a0\nNot even Theseus knew everything his brother had done during the Great War. Their\u00a0father\u00a0didn't, even.\u00a0\nTheseus felt his lip curl slightly at the raised eyebrow Perkins gave him as an American wizard stepped forward to greet them. The Americans, at least, were wise enough to have a designated area for porkey's to be used in their Ministry. A slight shake of his head had Perkins relaxing as the two officials did the usual meet-and-greet spiel, leaving the auror's in the room to size each other up.\nTheseus found himself unimpressed.\u00a0These\u00a0were the American aurors who hadn't been able to take Grindelwald down? Some of them at least. No wonder Newt had basically done their job for them.\n\"Where's Blue Coat?\" Perkins muttered to Theseus as they followed the officials out of the room and out into the rest of MACUSA. \"Figured he'd be here to meet us, to gloat and all that.\"\nTheseus shot Perkins a look. \"Newt doesn't gloat,\" he said firmly and Perkins blinked. Theseus smirked. \"Even if he does show us up all the time.\"\nPerkins snorted. \"I hear Cairo doesn't know if they want to hire him or ban him from Egypt after that last time with the Sphinx and those poachers.\"\n\"Cairo wouldn't\u00a0dare, he helps them too damned much,\" Theseus replied, eyes sparking with pride. \"How\u00a0else\u00a0would Al-Shalad and his team get a day off once a year?\"\nOne of the American auror\u2019s snorted and Theseus glanced at him. \"Met Al-Shalad then?\" He asked, raising an amused eyebrow when the American nodded. \"He's a good auror but poaching isn't really big on his list of priorities.\"\n\"Isn't big on\u00a0anyone's\u00a0list to be honest,\" Perkins muttered darkly. \"It's no wonder why when Blue Coat handles it himself without six months of paperwork bogging\u00a0him\u00a0down. \"\nTheseus grinned. \"Newt really doesn't care for paperwork, he's hardly managed to finish the first draft for his\u00a0book,\" he told Perkins who laughed. \"Want me to get you an advanced copy for your son? Even get Newt to pen something special for him if you like?\"\nPerkins nodded. \"Much appreciated Scamander.\"\nThey ignored the nonplussed looks on the American aurors\u2019 faces, following the officials into a well-lit, organised room that was far more modern than the rooms at their own Ministry. But for all the modernity of the design Theseus noted, things like paperwork stayed much the same.\nA small stack was already piled on one of the desks beneath the large windows that bathed the room in bright light. Outside he had a clear view of much of New York\u2014a novel experience in itself, to have a non-magical view of a city\u2014and Theseus took a moment to take it all in.\nIt really was breathtaking.\nPerkins knocked into him with his shoulder, jolting Theseus out of his brief contemplation and with a calm air, he turned his attention to the discussion between the two officials, slipping silently into one of the chairs at the desk nearest to him.\nThey'd be here until after the trial, possibly acting as escorts for Grindelwald to Azkaban if that was the verdict. Theseus wondered if he'd catch his brother before it was over, or if he'd have to wait for the annual family get-together to see his little brother. Somehow he imagined he'd be owling their mother and staging an emergency to get Newt home before next Yule.\nEh, he'd pulled dirtier tricks on his brother to get him to visit before, getting their mother in on the act didn't even register compared to having Dumbledore call his brother back home for a surprise birthday party.\nTheseus wondered if Newt had really forgiven him for pulling that stunt. Probably not. Oh well, he'd buy him another bow-tie to go with his suit for his travels or something, that'd cheer his brother right up.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStanding in the viewing gallery of the courtroom at the MACUSA\u2014an alien arrangement compared to the ones the Ministry had in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement\u2014Newt wondered how much longer he'd have to be here instead of with his animals. The room was surprisingly empty; only a limited number of people allowed into the room\u2014which included a thankfully small number of reporters from a variety of magical newspapers and\u00a0double\u00a0the amount of aurors Newt had expected. It seemed obvious, watching the trial proceed, that someone thought there could be a ruckus about to begin and had decided to cover all their bases.\nWell,\u00a0not quite.\nNewt appreciated the dedication to improved security by MACUSA, he really did, but it still wasn't perfect. Head angled down slightly, his fringe blocking any easy view of his eyes, Newt's gaze darted down and to the side to linger on the restrained figure he'd only had the displeasure of speaking to twice now.\u00a0\nTwice too many, really.\nGellert Grindelwald looked mightily different dressed in the nondescript clothes of a prisoner rather than the Head Auror of Magical Security. Mister Graves\u2014the man whose life Grindelwald had played about with for what had apparently been weeks\u2014sat\u00a0far\u00a0from the dark wizard. Newt considered that a truly wise thing considering the venomous looks Auror Graves had been giving his imposter from the moment he'd entered the room.\u00a0\nIt was a bit impressive how much\u00a0hate\u00a0Newt could read in Auror Graves' whole\u00a0being\u00a0as he stared at Grindelwald without pause. Newt wondered if someone had ordered the Head Auror of MACUSA to\u00a0not\u00a0kill Grindelwald if the dark wizard moved or something.\nIt might have been a wise idea.\u00a0\nNewt could\u00a0feel\u00a0the way Auror Graves all-but screamed out violence with his very well restrained magic. The strength of Auror Graves emotions added weight to his magic and Newt winced when it flared sharply as Grindelwald smirked at something being said. Newt bit his lip and strengthened his magical shields a bit more.\u00a0\nWhen the dark wizard had been brought into the room a dozen cameras had flashed repeatedly, near blinding Newt as he stood beside Tina and Queenie in the gallery. Newt had expected Grindelwald to focus on the cameras and do an attention-seeking, megalomaniac routine, but Grindelwald hadn't been interested in the cameras; nor the reporters that called out questions to him. Instead the dark wizard's gaze had swept across the courtroom, lingering for a moment on the Ministry officials from several governments\u2014including Newt's own. Grindelwald had barely spared President Picquery, poised to preside over the trial of the century, more than a moment of his attention before his focus continued, gaze moving on and coming to a slow, deliberate stop on Newt and his friends.\nTina had stiffened. Queenie instinctively reached for her sister as she encountered what Newt assumed was a strong mental barrier she couldn't penetrate. And Newt\u2026 Newt had felt the hair on the back of his neck stand on end.\u00a0\nA warning that danger was imminent. A predator with quarry in its sight and\u00a0intent on it.\nThe slight curl of Grindelwald\u2019s lip, and the way the dark wizard had let his head tip forward for his hair to act as a curtain around his face\u2026 Newt recognised a challenge\u2014a\u00a0goad\u00a0\u2014when he saw one.\nHe simply had no idea what to do with the fact that a deranged dark wizard had issued it to\u00a0him\u00a0of all people. Well, Newt didn't\u00a0want\u00a0to have an idea why Grindelwald had decided to focus on Newt at the expense of some attention-seeking and grandstanding in front of reporters. It didn't exactly bode well for him; Grindelwald foregoing attention on himself to instead issue Newt with a wordless challenge.\u00a0\n'Not that it matters,'\u00a0Newt thought.\nGrindelwald was powerless now, and, if it was possible, it was likely he'd face American justice instead of the arguably more lax justice Newt knew his own government preferred.\u00a0\nHe'd never believed that he'd\u00a0want\u00a0to see someone dead, not even the poachers who had hurt the creatures he'd rescued over the years, but Grindelwald\u2019s continued existence rubbed him the wrong way. Newt didn't know if it was because of the connection he knew between the dark wizard and Dumbledore\u2014the only professor to fight for him at school; for many reasons\u2014or if it was something deeper, more instinctive that drove him to favour neutralising a threat.\u00a0\nAnd really, that was the most disconcerting thing of all.\u00a0\nFortunately, Newt could ignore Grindelwald\u2019s focus on him by centring his own attention on the proceedings of the trial; like his testimony.\u00a0\nHis testimony, thankfully, had been short; mostly glossed over the hows and whys he'd conveniently had a\u00a0Thunderbird\u00a0in his possession and his interaction with Credence. Newt had stopped the official talking about Credence as an\u00a0it\u00a0and monstrously. Credence had been a victim of cruelty who deserved kindness but hadn't received it enough to make any real difference to his survival. It was unfair and cruel and the fact that Newt's own testimony seemed to be directed more towards how Grindelwald had attempted to\u00a0use\u00a0Credence rather than Newt's own duel with the dark wizard was\u2026 both a relief and disappointing.\u00a0\nIt cleared Newt of too much attention on his actions in the duel with Grindelwald which was good, but it unfortunately meant Credence was sensationalised as a destructive\u00a0thing\u00a0and not a very hurt young man who was destroyed by magic which ought to have been his salvation.\nThe smirk Grindelwald wore when Newt had been permitted only to give short answers to his duel with the dark wizard didn't make Newt feel any better. Grindelwald, just like Newt, understood what the MACUSA had decided in their approach to the dark wizard's trial.\nNewt couldn't help Credence any more. Credence was gone.\nHe couldn't even help keep the\u00a0memory\u00a0of Credence as something other than a destructive magical force alive because of Grindelwald and his trial.\nNewt's\u00a0only\u00a0benefit from this calculated direction of questions\u2014obviously MACUSA's way of minimising the impact of a civilian doing their job for them; a civilian who had been a fugitive at the time as well; as well as President Picquery's 'gift' by minimising the inclusion of Newt's creatures in the narrative\u2014was that he didn't have to list the spells and charms he'd cast duelling Grindelwald.\u00a0\nIt would have been a\u00a0long\u00a0list.\u00a0\nTheseus, and several years travelling the world alone without back-up, had provided Newt with an exhaustive list of spells to call on. A list that was so full of bastardised spells and charms, jinxes that certainly would have been considered illegal in\u00a0Britain\u00a0never mind America, and a choice selection of curses that Newt had cast only once before.\u00a0\nNo, it was a good thing that Newt's duelling prowess wasn't even remotely considered compared to Tina's. She was an actual auror, a\u00a0good\u00a0one, and as such her actions were considered far more important to the case and Grindelwald's discovery and capture.\u00a0\nStill\u2026 Newt couldn't help but keep coming back to that smirk Grindelwald had shot him, it bothered him. And now, looking at the dark wizard discreetly, Newt found himself tensing, body readying for a fight.\nHe shifted minutely, loosening his muscles and moving his hand closer to his wand in his coat pocket. Something wasn't right.\nNewt had never ignored his instincts, not since the first time his mother had introduced him to her griffins and, later, hippogriffs. Looking away from Grindelwald, Newt's gaze travelled across the room, seeking out his brother.\u00a0\nTheseus had the instincts of an auror\u2014sharp and reactive but also calm and steady\u2014and the instincts of an older brother\u2014alert to changes in a siblings mood, to when they wanted attention\u2014so it came as no surprise to Newt that his brother's blue-green eyes snapped onto Newt's own blue-grey after a few seconds of continuous staring.\u00a0\nHis brother could read Newt as well as Newt could read the mood of a Nundu from fifty paces. Theseus was even sharper on the uptake than his little brother sometimes on what a certain look meant.\nThe slow nod Theseus gave Newt was all that was needed for Newt to recognise that his brother was as aware of that niggling sense of wrongness. It seemed like they were the only ones who were.\nNewt wondered if that was perhaps due to their childhood, growing up surrounded by beasts like Griffins and Hippogriffs. Perhaps it did. But regardless, Newt and Theseus were prepared for whatever Grindelwald had planned. Whether\u00a0anyone\u00a0else\u00a0in the courtroom was prepared was another thing, but Newt had faith in the large number of aurors in the room\u2014especially\u00a0Tina.\u00a0\nA prickle of something, some sharp tingle that felt much like a shock from a muggle electrical device, had Newt grasping his wand a moment before pandemonium occurred.\u00a0\nA loud whistling sound followed by a snap-crack was all that heralded the appearance of over two dozen dark-dressed wizards in the middle of the courtroom. With a cry of surprise, the ministry official who had been speaking was tossed across the room, colliding with a gaggle of aurors who fell down in a heap from the impact.\u00a0\nNewt saw Tina pull her wand out of the corner of his eye. He was already moving. Newt jumped over the rail of the viewing gallery, landed in the middle of the courtroom, his wand flitting through the air as he cast spells ceaselessly. Shield charm. Disarming spell. Stunner. Tripping hex.\u00a0\nAll without a sound and many more beside.\nTheseus was in the middle of the room as well, the other British auror beside him, and Newt quickly darted towards them, nailing one of Grindelwald's gatecrashers with a vicious jinx before he could curse his brother.\u00a0\n\"Nice timing Blue Coat!\" The other auror shouted, flashing Newt a grin even as he cast a shield charm to repel several hexes thrown their way.\u00a0\n\"Do all of the auror\u2019s in your office use that\u00a0awful\u00a0nickname, Thee'?\" Newt asked, the three of them making an oddly-shaped triangle and casting non-verbally.\u00a0\n\"Perkins is the one who championed its use brother mine! Blame him!\" Theseus called back, a jet of water bursting out of his wand and slamming into one of the dark wizards in front of him.\u00a0\n\"Don't blame me! Blame your damned fashioned sense Scamander!\" Perkins jumped to the side, narrowly dodging a stinging hex that Newt countered before it could hit Theseus. \"Both of you!\"\u00a0\nNewt laughed, turning on his heel and nailing another attacker with a jelly-legs jinx. A school-yard jinx it might be, but the way the wizard stumbled and went down on his face showed how perfectly useful it was in a duel. Especially when followed by a powerful\u00a0stupefy\u00a0that they were too busy trying to cast the counter to the jelly-legs they forgot to pay attention.\u00a0\nA sudden blast of pure magical power nearly knocked them off their feet, the shield charm Perkins had cast shattering from the force and saving them from going flying across the courtroom. Newt blinked, throwing one last\u00a0stupefy\u00a0at a wizard groaning on the ground near to them, before his attention was stolen by the scene before him.\u00a0\nGellert Grindelwald stood, free of the enchantments that had kept him restrained, a wand dark as night, held loosely in his hand as he looked about the room.\u00a0\nPicquery, Graves and a half dozen aurors lay sprawled out on the ground in front of him, all of them groaning and stirring from the blast that had stunned them briefly.\u00a0\nTheseus' wand snapped up just as Perkins' and Newt's did, the three of them casting a powerful shield charm that deflected the spell Grindelwald aimed at the stunned aurors. It drew the dark wizard's attention and his mismatched eyes locked onto the three of them.\u00a0\n\"You think yourselves a match for me?\" Grindelwald sneered, sweeping his wand in a sharp arc, the force of the curse slamming into the shield Newt threw up around them. It cracked but didn't shatter from the force and Theseus took the opportunity to lash out at Grindelwald with a vicious hex, Perkins adding his own disabling charm to the assault.\nGrindelwald swept them both aside, rebounding the hex which shattered the fragile shield. A second curse, one coloured black, hit Perkins in the chest and dropped him without a word.\u00a0\nTheseus snarled in wordless anger, slashing through the air viciously. Grindelwald blocked the curse or hex, Newt wasn't quite sure what his brother had cast, and threw his own spell back.\u00a0\nNewt slammed into his brothers side, forcing them both out of the way of a jet of red light that hit one of the walls of the courtroom, beginning to melt the concrete on contact. He blindly waved his wand, hitting Grindelwald's shield with a jinx that bought them both enough time to scramble to their feet and throw another set of spells at the dark wizard.\u00a0\nGrindelwald laughed, a horrid rasping sound that gave Newt goosebumps. \"Children's jinxes aren't a challenge to me Mister Scamander!\"\n\"They weren't meant to be.\" Theseus smirked, standing shoulder to shoulder beside Newt.\u00a0\n\"Good for distraction though,\" Newt added softly, smiling at Grindelwald's frown.\u00a0\n\"Stupefy!\"\nGrindelwald snarled, turning sharply and barely managing to deflect the powerful red beam shot at him by a kneeling Percival Graves. The look on Graves' face was just shy of murderous.\u00a0\nGrindelwald swept his wand in a sharp, downward arc towards Graves who threw himself to the side, his own wand moving perpendicular to Grindelwald's own. The two spells hit each other in mid-air and emitted a bright flash that blinded everyone in the room for a minute.\u00a0\nNewt blindly cast another spell in Grindelwald's direction, pleased when the dark wizard let out a surprised curse. He followed it up with a series of chain-spells designed to distract Grindelwald as Theseus began casting a complex spell.\u00a0\nThe wand-work took over a minute but if he could cast it, it'd disable Grindelwald quite effectively for a good while.\u00a0\nNewt was his brother's defender up until that point; Graves a useful distraction.\u00a0\nThe other aurors in the room were either still stunned from the force of the magical explosion or in their own skirmishes with whatever remained of Grindelwald's fanatics.\u00a0\nTina and Queenie worked together, chain-casting on the ends of each other's spells and holding off four different wizards. Picquery had several Auror's with her and they were collectively handling the majority of the wizards that had apparated into the courtroom.\u00a0\nEven the reporters were fighting here and there.\u00a0\nWith a snarl, Graves conjured a torrent of flame and aimed it at Grindelwald who dispelled it quickly, managing to deflect Newt's stinging jinx just in time to avoid burnt fingers.\nA guttural series of sounds from Grindelwald that Newt vaguely recognised as German had Graves flying backwards, unable to counter a foreign curse so easily.\u00a0\nThat left Newt defending his brother against Grindelwald. Alone.\u00a0\n\"Protego!\" A blue bubble shield materialised around Theseus as Newt leapt to the side, narrowly avoiding a deadly curse. He moved carefully, blocking and deflecting the wordless spells Grindelwald threw at him\u2014forever thankful that he'd accepted the duelling offer from Albus last year.\u00a0\nA burst of inspiration hit Newt as he barely managed to deflect another curse. He was mostly on the defence right now, unable to spare much time to cast any sort of complicated or powerful spell, but that didn't mean he couldn't buy himself time to cast one. Only that he'd need to be\u00a0creative.\nThe Swooping Evil in his pocket was a creative idea.\u00a0\nSlipping a hand into his pocket, Newt let the creature loose just as he cast a stupefy at Grindelwald, buying the creature a second to swoop up into the air and skirt the edge of the room.\u00a0\nMimicking the sound of another Swooping Evil, Newt had it diving at the wizards in the room, effectively disrupting a great many of the occupants and their duels. Grindelwald was likewise distracted when a stray jinx hit him from behind as a dark wizard was struck by the Swooping Evil.\u00a0\nNewt was already moving before he realised, wand sweeping through the air quickly and sharply, powering through the motions for a powerful disabling spell he'd once used on an entire group of poachers in East Asia.\u00a0\nHe hoped it worked as well now as it did then.\nGrindelwald's wand shot out of his hand with a loud bang that deafened everyone in such close quarters. With a surprised cry, the dark wizard was flung backwards, slamming into a wall and slumping to the ground in a confused daze.\u00a0\nJust as he hit the wall, Theseus' own spell was completed and dozens of fine, gossamer threads shot out of his wand, latching onto Grindelwald and wrapping him from head-to-toe in a silvery cocoon. The reason the spell took so long to cast was due to the nature of the threads it produced; highly resistant to magic, they could only be undone by the one who cast the spell in the first place.\u00a0\nThe remaining dark wizards were summarily subdued by the aurors in the room\u2014aided by the Swooping Evil that followed Newt's directions as he threw\u00a0stupefy's\u00a0at anyone who wasn't an auror or a reporter.\u00a0\nThe grin Theseus gave him when he woke Perkins who cursed viciously, made Newt grin back. The amazed look\u00a0Perkins\u00a0gave him had him blushing and ducking his head in embarrassment.\u00a0\nNewt doubted he'd be able to pass this off as chance to people. Not when so many aurors had basically just bore witness to his\u00a0duel\u00a0with Grindelwald. A one-on-one duel that\u00a0Newt had won.\u00a0\nThe curious look Mister Graves had given Newt before he left the courtroom with his brother had confirmed that fact. Queenie appearing at his side, slipping her arm around his and smiling at him knowingly, had made Newt smile bashfully.\u00a0\n\"You were brilliant Newt,\" she murmured, her eyes bright and full of fondness. \"A regular knight.\"\u00a0\nNewt's blush returned in full as Theseus choked on his laughter. \"I didn't do that much Queenie.\"\u00a0\nThe stern look Queenie gave Newt almost had him looking away from the young witch, but she deserved better than Newt's usual habits and he forced himself to not look away from her knowing gaze.\u00a0\n\"If that's what you can do when you 'don't do much' then I wonder what you can do when you put your mind to it,\" Queenie paused for a moment before smirking suddenly. \"Blue Coat.\"\u00a0\nTheseus' laughter drowned out Newt's groan of exasperation as they exited the courtroom.\u00a0\nHe'd never be rid of that nickname now!\u00a0"
