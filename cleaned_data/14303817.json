    "text": "The Class 1-A dorm has a small gym beneath the common room. Tucked behind a laundry room and a closet full of cleaning supplies and extra towels, it looks like a gym that might belong to a regular apartment complex, not to an elite hero school.\nTodoroki doesn\u2019t visit often. It\u2019s usually too crowded when he tries, and the noise and sweat-stink is nauseating.\nWhen he heads into the basement level of the dorms, it\u2019s past midnight. At this time, most of his classmates are asleep, but he couldn\u2019t bear to stay in his room any longer, so he gathered up a basket of laundry and made his way down here. Before he can head into the laundry room, he pauses. Someone is panting heavily in the gym. The laboured breathing sounds pained, pushed and pulled through struggling lungs.\nHe peeks in, and sees Midoriya slumped against the right wall, head tipped back. His chest rises and falls, heaving, tracksuit soaked in sweat, fringe slicked back.\nTodoroki abandons his laundry, and joins Midoriya on the floor.\nTodoroki isn\u2019t sure Midoriya knows he\u2019s not alone, if he even realises other people exist outside this bubble of space in this moment, but when Todoroki sits down beside him, their shoulders grazing, Midoriya doesn\u2019t startle. He doesn\u2019t even look up.\nTodoroki looks out at the row of treadmills. There\u2019s no one on them tonight. Usually, when he comes here before dinner, it\u2019s full, and there\u2019s a queue of people waiting their turn. It feels strange to see it empty. Like they\u2019ve accidentally entered another place, another time.\nWhen Midoriya finally speaks, he sounds hollow. \u201cI\u2019m not finished.\u201d\nTodoroki cocks one head to the side. \u201cI think you are.\u201d\n\u201cI have more reps to do.\u201d\n\u201cIf Aizawa caught you down here, he\u2019d suspend you from physical training. We have a rescue exercise coming on Wednesday, and you\u2019re supposed to be in my group. We\u2019re counting on you. Don\u2019t let us down.\u201d\nMidoriya\u2019s hands tighten around his calves. There\u2019s a tension about him that can\u2019t be released through exercise, the kind of pressure that won\u2019t go away no matter how beaten your body becomes. This, Todoroki knows.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Todoroki says. \u201cThat came out wrong. You\u2019re not letting us down. You won\u2019t. You never have.\u201d\nMidoriya squints out at the treadmills. Todoroki wonders if he finds the ghostly emptiness strange, too. Probably not. He doubts this is the first time Midoriya has snuck down here to work out, or even the second, or the third.\n\u201cI need to be stronger,\u201d Midoriya says.\n\u201cIt\u2019s late.\u201d Todoroki peeks at him. Sweat trickles down his strong arms. His eyes are rimmed with dark shadows. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to go to bed?\u201d\n\u201cYou go to bed, Todoroki. You don\u2019t have to babysit me.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t sleep. That\u2019s why I came down here. My room\u2026\u201d Todoroki exhales, the sound barely audible even in the near-silence of the gym. Midoriya has a way of stripping him down to his most honest and vulnerable parts. Todoroki has always admired his earnestness, and the earnestness he inspires in others. He shouldn\u2019t flinch away from it, especially now. \u201cIt reminds me of my room back at my house.\u201d\nNow, Midoriya looks at him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cIf I asked you to go to sleep, would you?\u201d\nMidoriya shrugs. \u201cProbably not.\u201d\nAt least he\u2019s not putting up a front, Todoroki thinks.\nHe can\u2019t go back to bed and leave Midoriya like this, sweat-soaked and shaking with overexertion. He isn\u2019t going to last if he keeps this up. He\u2019s a candle burning at both ends.\nHe won\u2019t accept Todoroki\u2019s help, though. Not directly.\nTodoroki wets his lips. \u201cWould you go to bed with me?\u201d\nMidoriya drops his towel. His face is blotchy pink, his hands a bloodless white, circulation in disarray after hours of nonstop exercise. He\u2019s too ruined to even blush, but his eyes bulge, and he trips over his tongue, like it\u2019s forgotten how to form syllables, and Todoroki thinks, wryly, I should have phrased that better.\n\u201cGo to bed? With\u2014with\u2014with you?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be in my room tonight,\u201d Todoroki says, \u201cbut yours looks different from mine. Maybe if I were there, somewhere mostly unfamiliar, or at least disconnected from my house, with another person, then \u2026 \u201d Midoriya looks like his brain is shutting down. \u201cAh. Perhaps that was too presumptuous. Nevermind, then.\u201d\nTodoroki looks back out at the treadmills. Maybe he could collect extra bedding from the supply closet and sleep here, on the plastic tread, a sheet pulled over his head to protect his eyes from the glaring lights overhead. He could keep an eye on Midoriya. Even if he couldn\u2019t stop him from blowing out his arms, he could make sure he was drinking water, and taking breaks, and call for Recovery Girl or a teacher if it looked like Midoriya was going too far.\nA clammy hand wraps around his forearm. \u201cNo,\u201d Midoriya says. The gleam in his eyes has returned, changed, now focused on Todoroki rather than his overwhelming future goals. \u201cYou can come. You should. I don\u2019t have a spare futon, though.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s alright,\u201d Todoroki says. \u201cI can take the floor.\u201d\nMidoriya shakes his head, his sweaty curls bouncing around his face. \u201cNo, you take the bed! I\u2019ll sleep on the floor.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not about to kick you out of your own bed.\u201d Midoriya opens his mouth to protest, so Todoroki cuts him off, \u201cWe can share.\u201d\nMidoriya\u2019s mouth closes with a click of teeth. He swallows. \u201cTogether?\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re uncomfortable, then don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Todoroki says, considering the line of treadmills again.\nMidoriya grabs his arm again. He must understand the way Todoroki is eyeing the treadmills, because he stands up, bones creaking and clicking, wincing at the pull in his muscles, and gestures for Todoroki to stand, too.\n\u201cAs long as you\u2019re okay with it, then I\u2019m okay with it,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ll share a bed. Together. Yeah. You and me. Yes.\u201d\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\nMidoriya laughs nervously. \u201cYes, it\u2019s just\u2026 the last time I shared a bed I was a little kid. I haven\u2019t had a sleepover since I was \u2026 five?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve never had one.\u201d\nMidoriya looks at him again, that same light in his eyes. Todoroki doesn\u2019t know how that much determination can live inside of one high school boy. \u201cLet\u2019s go, then.\u201d\n\u201cYou need to do cool down stretches, and you should probably shower. Have you eaten?\u201d\nMidoriya winces. \u201cI ate at dinner?\u201d\n\u201cThat was hours ago.\u201d Todoroki fetches his laundry. \u201cYou finish up and go shower, and I\u2019ll fetch us something to eat so we can meet on the way up.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTodoroki has been in Midoriya\u2019s room before. He\u2019s studied here with Iida and Uraraka, Midoriya\u2019s hero analysis notes spilled across the floor, marvelling at Midoriya\u2019s dedication and thoroughness. He knows it looks more like an All Might shrine than a dorm room.\nMidoriya still fidgets, though, glancing from Todoroki to his posters, until Todoroki simply tells him, \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d\nHe climbs into bed first, shuffling to the far side. Midoriya gets in after him. It\u2019s a double-single, big enough for them both, but they\u2019re still pressed up close. He can feel the warmth of another body, the scratchy sheets and the thick duvet. There\u2019s only one pillow, and they share it, staring at each other, inches apart.\n\u201cThis is \u2026 \u201d Todoroki tries.\nMidoriya rolls onto his stomach, hiding his face against the mattress. \u201cIt\u2019s awkward! I\u2019m sorry, Todoroki. I should sleep on the floor.\u201d\n\u201cI was going to say it\u2019s a tight fit,\u201d Todoroki amends. \u201cCome closer. You\u2019re barely hanging off the pillow. And you\u2019re too stiff\u2014you\u2019ll never fall asleep like that.\u201d\nMidoriya peeks up at him, and swallows audibly. Is he afraid? Why?\nAh. Todoroki is probably making him uncomfortable.\nBut before he can offer to sleep on the floor again and spark another argument, Midoriya shuffles closer until his head is braced on the pillow. Todoroki hooks his hand under Midoriya\u2019s elbow, and drags him closer still. Midoriya squeaks like a caught bird.\nHis curls brush against Todoroki\u2019s temples, though their bodies aren\u2019t touching. Their faces are so close. Midoriya\u2019s eyes are big, and green, and awed.\nThe AC hums through the room. Everyone else is asleep, or at least silent, and it makes Todoroki want to hold his breath and maintain this silence. The pillow smells like shampoo. Midoriya\u2019s shampoo. Todoroki pushes his nose into the pillow, and closes his eyes, and inhales, all the energy suddenly leeched from his body.\n\u201cTodoroki?\u201d\n\u201cHm?\u201d He asks without opening his eyes.\n\u201c\u2026Nothing, sorry.\u201d\nTodoroki is asleep before he can ask what Midoriya had meant to say. If he hadn\u2019t fallen asleep so quickly, if he had taken a moment to look at him, he would have seen Midoriya holding perfectly still on the other side of the pillow, eyes open, studying the fall of bright hair over pale skin and the peaceful contours of Todoroki\u2019s face, as though this were the first time he had ever seen him.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTodoroki wakes up first. It takes him a moment to remember where he is, but then he looks to his right and sees Midoriya drooling into the pillow, and remembers.\nMidoriya\u2019s eyes crack open, as though he\u2019d sensed that Todoroki was awake. Midoriya blinks at him, and Todoroki waits for him to accuse him of staring, but instead, Midoriya scrunches up his face and says, \u201cYou tricked me.\u201d\n\u201cHm?\u201d\n\u201cLast night, when you were trying to get me to stop exercising. You drew attention to yourself so that I\u2019d leave the gym.\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t apologise for that. It worked, after all.\u201d\n\u201cYou really were struggling though, weren\u2019t you?\u201d\nMidoriya doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s doubting him, but rather like he\u2019s just confirming his own suspicions. \u201cI was,\u201d Todoroki admits, \u201cbut I probably would have gone and slept on the couch. I only told you because I was worried about you, and wanted to help.\u201d\n\u201cWorried,\u201d Midoriya echoes\n\u201cYes. I don\u2019t like seeing you hurt. And I especially don\u2019t like seeing you hurt yourself. You should go to someone if that happens.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m used to dealing with things on my own,\u201d Midoriya says, curling further into his sheets. \u201cI should be strong enough to handle it at this point. If I can\u2019t manage now, then what about in a year? In two years? In ten? When our schoolwork picks up, and then, when we become pros and start making our way out in the real world with people relying on us? I can\u2019t falter.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re human,\u201d Todoroki says. \u201cHolding yourself to inhuman standards will lead you nowhere. Or at least nowhere good.\u201d\nTodoroki knows this intimately. He grew up beneath Endeavour\u2019s thumb, witness to the obsession rotting him from the inside out. And now he has All Might\u2014in his blood splattered, powerless form\u2014as his teacher.\nMidoriya closes his eyes. Todoroki thinks he might have fallen asleep again, but then he curls his hand in a fistful of sheets, and takes a shuddering breath. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt anyone. Or worry them. Everyone\u2019s worried enough, aren't they?\u201d\n\u201cWould you come to me, then?\u201d\nMidoriya\u2019s eyes snap open. \u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d\n\u201cI already know that you\u2019re struggling. Let me help.\u201d\nHe\u2019s not the best person for these kinds of things, but if Midoriya trusts him, then he\u2019ll be there for his friend, in whatever way he can.\n\nYou saved me once. So please.\n\n\u201cOnly if you come to me, as well,\u201d Midoriya says firmly, because of course. But it\u2019s alright\u2014more than alright, even\u2014because Todoroki knows he\u2019s won. Midoriya will never shy away from something if it means helping someone else. \u201cWhen you\u2019re struggling, when you hate the way your room looks, you can come to mine. My door is always open for you.\u201d\nTodoroki looks him over. His curls spring up at gravity-defying angles, and he\u2019s wearing a ratty t-shirt displaying the name of a hero Todoroki doesn\u2019t recognise. His lips are wet, open a hair\u2019s width apart. His eyes are like sea glass, lit by the thin vein of sunlight coming in through the window.\nThe room behind them is covered in All Might posters and figurines. Todoroki never had anything like this as a child, even though he remembers begging his mum for an All Might action figure for Christmas when he was too young to know better. He wonders if he would have collected his own merchandise, had he been someone else\u2019s son.\nProbably not. He can\u2019t imagine this predilection suiting anyone but Midoriya, even though there are thousands of like-minded hero fans in Japan.\n\u201cAlways open,\u201d Todoroki murmurs to himself.\nMidoriya blinks, and seems to realise the situation that they\u2019re in. He lets out a squeak, and flinches backward and off the bed. He lands with a thump.\nTodoroki scrambles after him, peeking over the edge of the bed. Midoriya is upside down; his feet are tangled in the sheets beside Todoroki; his head is against the legs of his desk chair.\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\n\u201cSo\u2014sorry.\u201d Midoriya flails and tries to pull himself up, but he only manages to further entangle himself. He kicks Todoroki in the shin. \u201cSorry!\u201d\nWith Todoroki\u2019s help, Midoriya rights himself. He won\u2019t meet Todoroki\u2019s eyes.\n\u201cThank you for last night,\u201d Midoriya finally says, standing awkwardly in the middle of the room. \u201cFor taking care of me.\u201d\nThey\u2019ll have to get ready for class soon. Todoroki will have to make his way back to his own room, and hope no one sees him and teases him mercilessly on the way.\nEven if they did, Todoroki doesn\u2019t think he would care.\n\u201cAnytime,\u201d Todoroki says.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFour days later, Todoroki wakes up shivering and covered in sweat. His floor is a mirror of ice.\nHe picks himself away from his frost-coated blanket, dragging lumps of ice off his pillow, and pushes his damp hair out of his face. He doesn\u2019t pause to get his breathing under control before he gets to work melting the ice spidering across his floor. It\u2019s thickest around the top of his mat, crystalline chunks with jagged edges zigzagging in a semi-circle around where his head had lain. It looks violent, like a deliberate assault against an invisible foe.\nOr a desperate defence.\nSteam swells in his cramped dorm room, and he uses a towel to mop up the excess water. His temperature rights itself without any conscious effort on his part, though Todoroki almost wishes it wouldn\u2019t. He doesn\u2019t mind being cold, sometimes. It grounds him.\nIn the dark, his room is formless and unidentifiable. Todoroki climbs to his feet, and, almost without thinking, manages the short walk to Midoriya\u2019s.\nHe has to set an example, he tells himself. That\u2019s why he\u2019s doing this. If Midoriya doesn\u2019t think Todoroki needs him, if he thinks the deal isn\u2019t helping Todoroki, then he won\u2019t reciprocate when he\u2019s in a bad place.\nMidoriya opens the door at his knock. His hair is even messier then it was that quiet, sunlit morning a few days ago, adding an additional inch or two to his height.\nMidoriya squints at him. \u201cTodoroki? It\u2019s 1am \u2026 \u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Todoroki says. \u201cHave you changed your mind?\u201d\n\u201cChanged my\u2014\u201d Midoriya comes to life, then. He rubs grit out of his eyes, and stands a bit taller. \u201cNo, no. Come in.\u201d\nTodoroki follows Midoriya back into his room, shutting the door and standing awkwardly in front of it. He still doesn\u2019t feel right in his own skin. Maybe he\u2019s still half-asleep. Maybe he\u2019s still there, in his dream, in that room, bent over his knees and clinging to his consciousness, trying to right his swimming vision, rather than here, with Midoriya standing a mere meter away.\n\u201cYou\u2019re shaking,\u201d Midoriya says. He gets back into bed, pushing up against the wall, and lifts the blanket. \u201cCome on. You need to warm up.\u201d\nTodoroki climbs into bed without arguing. Only after he\u2019s under the duvet, sheets clinging to his clammy skin, does he remind him, \u201cI have a temperature-regulating quirk.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Right.\u201d There\u2019s a moment of fragile quiet, before Midoriya clears his throat. \u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\nTodoroki expects Midoriya to push, but he doesn\u2019t. They lie together, not quite touching but close enough to sense each other\u2019s presence, until they fall asleep.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHis pillow is crusted with a thin layer of frost. Todoroki shifts experimentally, and ice crunches under his legs. The blankets and mattress are frosted over, too. It\u2019s not uncommon for him to wake up like this, especially after a nightmare, so he doesn\u2019t panic.\nHe\u2019s not used to this happening around other people, however.\nMidoriya looks like a winter sprite. His dark hair is near-white with powdery ice. It clings to his eyelashes and his freckles. Like this, he looks ethereal, almost delicate.\nThankfully, his lips aren\u2019t blue. Todoroki curses himself. It\u2019s only the second time they\u2019ve shared a bed, and he just had to do this to Midoriya.\nHe prods Midoriya until he wakes up. He blinks, sleep dazed, and then seems to realise who is in his bed, and what they\u2019re covered in.\n\u201cTodoroki?\u201d Midoriya sits up. Fractured ice showers his lap. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\u201cI accidentally frosted over your bed.\u201d\nMidoriya brings a hand up to his hair, feeling the hardened curls, and Todoroki bites back a smile. His bed-head has been preserved in ice, frozen in its wild state. It will be even harder to run a comb through it now.\n\u201cI can unfreeze everything,\u201d Todoroki adds. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I know this must be uncomfortable.\u201d\nBut Midoriya isn\u2019t pulling himself out of bed and demanding that Todoroki get rid of the ice. He\u2019s staring at Todoroki like he\u2019s never seen him before, something disturbingly like awe in his eyes.\n\u201cYou did this? In your sleep?\u201d Todoroki nods. Midoriya flails a hand over his bedside table until he finds a notebook and pen. He flips it open, turning back to Todoroki. \u201cYour quirk can activate while you\u2019re unconscious? That\u2019s fascinating. Can I assume it only works enough to be an inconvenience, not to actually hurt you? Have you ever used your fire side accidentally while you\u2019re asleep?\nTodoroki blinks at him. \u201cYou\u2019re not mad?\u201d\n\u201cMad? Why would I be mad?\u201d\nTodoroki gestures at the two of them, at their pillow and blanket, frosted over with ice. It would look like it had snowed inside Midoriya\u2019s room, except the rest of it is untouched, save for the bed. \u201cI froze your bed. With you in it.\u201d\nMidoriya waves a hand in the air. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. You can unfreeze it, right? And besides, this is amazing! I assume it\u2019s triggered by your nightmares? Do you think your quirk is acting as some kind of defence mechanism, trying to protect you from a perceived threat, even if you\u2019re unconscious and the threat itself doesn\u2019t exist?\u201d\nMidoriya never fails to baffle him. Anyone else would be shouting and running for a hot shower after waking up in their own dorm room coated in ice, but Midoriya is taking notes.\n\u201cI woke up to some of my ice earlier, but after I came here, I didn\u2019t have any more nightmares. It\u2019s almost like you chased them away.\u201d\nMidoriya\u2019s pen lowers. He stares at Todoroki over his notebook. \u201cOh.\u201d\nTodoroki climbs over Midoriya to get out of bed, and starts evaporating the ice. He works slowly, making sure most of the ice fizzes out into steam, rather than melting and soaking Midoriya\u2019s bed.\nMidoriya sits on the desk chair, watching Todoroki work, squirming. He reminds Todoroki of a kid trying his best to be patient. He must be bursting with questions about Todoroki\u2019s quirk.\nOnce the bed is dry, Todoroki sits on the edge of it, facing Midoriya, whose hair is still ice-kissed.\nHe doesn\u2019t look bothered by it.\nHe looks otherworldly.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Todoroki says, getting comfortable in the bed once more. \u201cAsk away.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOver two weeks pass.\nTodoroki keeps an eye on Midoriya to see if he goes to the gym to overexert himself, but he doesn\u2019t. He doesn\u2019t think Midoriya is avoiding him\u2014they have lunch together, and they study together, and sometimes, they\u2019ll catch each other\u2019s eye across the classroom or the common area, and they\u2019ll smile, a moment of acknowledgement passing between them\u2014but they haven\u2019t been near each other\u2019s room since they woke up tangled together and covered in frost.\nWhen a knock comes not long after dinner, Todoroki is expecting Iida or Yaoyorozu, inviting him to study for Friday\u2019s test. He doesn\u2019t find studying in groups too helpful, but he never turns their invitations down.\nIt\u2019s not either of them. Todoroki opens the door and finds Midoriya, standing stiffly, shaking hands balled into tight fists. His eyes are incredibly focused, the way they get during training exercises, when all thought is leeched from his mind, all the room taken up by battle analysis and searing determination.\n\u201cI am very close,\u201d Midoriya says through his teeth, \u201cto doing something I will regret.\u201d\nTodoroki quickly goes over a list of places they can go. They can\u2019t leave campus without prior notice and decent reason, but UA itself is huge. \u201cDo you want to say here?\u201d\nMidoriya opens his mouth. A shallow explosion echoes from above, along with the faint sounds of indignant yelling. He closes his mouth, jaw clicking.\n\u201cLet me get us jackets,\u201d Todoroki says.\nHe ducks back into his room, grabs his black peacoat, and throws it over his arm. His hoodie is folded on his desk. He probably shouldn\u2019t give Midoriya something that isn\u2019t impeccably clean, but he\u2019s only slept in it twice, and it\u2019s the softest thing he owns.\n\u201cOkay, let\u2019s go.\u201d\nThey walk stiffly downstairs, and through the common room. It\u2019s quiet, considering most of their classmates don\u2019t go to bed until late. The few people in the kitchen hardly take notice of them.\nTodoroki leads them away from the dorm building. He doesn\u2019t have a destination in mind\u2014getting out of sight of the dorms and staying away from training complexes that might tempt Midoriya is his only goal.\nHe likes sparring with Midoriya, but when Midoriya is like this, shaking with excess energy, tight-lipped and serious, he pushes himself in dangerous ways. If either of them used their quirk without supervision in one of the larger training complexes and injured themselves, they would be harshly reprimanded, maybe even placed on temporary probation, which would only increase Midoriya\u2019s anxiety about being static, about not doing enough, about not being enough.\nTodoroki wonders when Midoriya started making so much sense to him. Did that blinding moment they shared at the sports festival bring them this close, or do you come to know someone better while sharing space with them, by sleeping beside them?\n\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d Midoriya asks, staring up at him, bottom lip caught between his teeth. He looks like a loud noise could set him off.\n\u201cSharing a bed,\u201d Todoroki says.\nMidoriya is so startled that he trips and almost face-plants. Todoroki grabs his arm and pulls him back up in one smooth motion. Midoriya sways under his grip, shaking his head like a dog with water in its ears.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cDo you think sharing a bed with someone helps you to get to know them better?\u201d\nMidoriya straightens up, and Todoroki waits a moment before letting his hand drop. \u201cMaybe? You would learn more about their sleeping habits, and maybe about their pyjama preferences, and maybe more if they talked in their sleep and revealed personal information.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d They start a slow amble around the main building. It\u2019s dark, but there are lights embedded into the path, and above them, various windows are lit up with staff working late in their offices or classrooms. \u201cDo you learn more about someone\u2019s thoughts and fears by proxy?\u201d\n\u201cLike osmosis?\u201d Midoriya squints up at the starless sky. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s probably more likely that spending time with someone affords you a better understanding of their thought pattern.\u201d\nTodoroki nods along to Midoriya\u2019s rationale, and notes, quietly, that he\u2019s stopped shaking. Some of the tightness around his eyes and mouth is gone.\nTodoroki realises he\u2019s still cradling their jackets. He holds out the hoodie to Midoriya. \u201cHere.\u201d\n\u201cOh! I couldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI brought it out here for you to wear. If you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll just be carrying it around.\u201d\nMidoriya reaches for the hoodie and slips it on. It\u2019s long in the sleeves, reaching down to his fingertips, but it fits perfectly in the shoulders and upper arms. A little too perfectly, really. Todoroki finds himself wondering if, in a few years\u2019 time, his clothes will be too tight for Midoriya, straining across his muscles.\nMidoriya is built sturdier than him. His quirk relies on strength, so it would make sense.\nMidoriya peeks up at him from beneath his fringe, fidgeting with the hoodie\u2019s long sleeves. He brings the hem up to his nose. \u201cIt\u2019s soft. And it smells nice.\u201d\nTodoroki swallows. Suddenly, he feels dehydrated. Did he forget to drink water today? Did he forget to drink water all week?\n\u201cAre you feeling okay, Todoroki?\u201d\n\u201cWhat happened earlier?\u201d he asks hoarsely, ignoring the strange static feeling crawling across his skin. It must be the peacoat. He hasn\u2019t worn it in a while.\nMidoriya drops his arms, his expression hardening. \u201cKacchan happened.\u201d\nTodoroki stops, and directs them to the dry area beneath a cropping of trees, dimly lit by the nearby path\u2019s light. He sits against the trunk, and Midoriya joins him. Their shoulders brush.\n\u201cTell me more,\u201d Todoroki says.\nMidoriya balls his hands back into fists, and starts explaining. It\u2019s nothing new\u2014micro-aggressions, and moments exchanged in training that are more brutal than any student sparring should be, the history between them simmering on a low boil\u2014but that, if anything, has set Midoriya off.\nHe grits his teeth. \u201cHe\u2019s working to be better, to move past this, I know he is, but some days\u2014 some days, he just \u2026 \u201d\n\u201cI understand,\u201d Todoroki says. Midoriya exhales, shoulders slumping. \u201cI\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t go straight for the gym.\u201d\n\u201cI almost did. I wanted to work out some of this energy, but I was worried I would run into Kacchan, and I\u2019d do something I\u2019d regret, and then I remembered my promise to you.\u201d\nMidoriya leans more heavily against him. Todoroki goes still. It reminds him of having a cat curl up in his lap, and sitting motionless, afraid of moving and spooking the creature.\n\u201cBeing around you is calming,\u201d Midoriya admits.\n\u201cDo you feel better now? Do you think Bakugou will be an issue tomorrow?\u201d\n\u201cProbably not. It\u2019s hit and miss with him. Some days are better than others, some days are worse, and there\u2019s no way of guessing which will be when.\u201d\nThey sit shoulder to shoulder and talk. The temperature of the air dropping as night advances, and Midoriya shivers and presses up against Todoroki\u2019s warm side. He puts his arm around Midoriya\u2019s shoulder, so that the warmth can trickle from him to his friend.\nMidoriya falls asleep like that. Todoroki watches him. Almost without realising it, he falls asleep, too.\nA hand shakes him awake. Todoroki\u2019s face is pressed into something soft, tickling his nose. He blinks, shifts, and realises his cheek has sunk into Midoriya\u2019s wild hair.\nAizawa crouches patiently in front of them. \u201cYou two should be in the dorms.\u201d\nTodoroki gently shakes Midoriya awake. He takes a moment to look up at Todoroki, their sides still pressed up together, Todoroki\u2019s arm still around him, before registering Aizawa. He jumps away from Todoroki with a shout.\nAizawa sighs. \u201cCurfew was ten minutes ago. Don\u2019t go on any more romantic strolls at night; I don\u2019t want to have to track you down again. Find better ways to spoon on your own time.\u201d\nMidoriya blushes, and Todoroki finds the grass beneath his feet suddenly fascinating.\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t\u2014we were just\u2014\u201d Midoriya tries to explain, before giving up.\nAizawa sighs through his nose. \u201cCome on, I\u2019ll walk you back.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe next time Todoroki opens his door to Midoriya, he\u2019s not surprised to see him. He\u2019s not shaking this time, though he is bouncing from foot to foot, looking everywhere but at Todoroki.\n\u201cIs this okay?\u201d Midoriya wonders, and it sounds more like he\u2019s directing the question towards himself. \u201cI should have texted you first, at least. You might have been busy, and this can seem pretty presumptuous, now that I think about it. What if you stop wanting to do this, but you\u2019re too polite to say something, and you keep doing this because you feel like you don\u2019t have a choice\u2014?\u201d\nTodoroki grabs a fistful of his sweatshirt and drags him into his dorm. Midoriya stumbles in and the door clicks closed. He jumps at the sound.\nTodoroki studies him. Midoriya\u2019s eyes are trained on the ground, and he\u2019s playing with his hands, knotting his fingers together. \u201cDo you think I could make those thoughts stop?\u201d\nMidoriya looks from the floor to Todoroki\u2019s face, before his gaze darts to the side, like he\u2019s afraid of making eye contact. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYour anxiety. That second-guessing that you\u2019re doing. Your brain running at full speed. It can\u2019t be comfortable for you, can it?\u201d Todoroki steps closer. \u201cDo you think that I could help?\u201d\nFor a moment, Midoriya stops breathing. Then, he exhales noisily. \u201cYou already do. My mind gets quiet around you.\u201d\n\u201cQuiet?\u201d\n\u201cLike when you\u2019re soaking in the bath, and all your thoughts fall away, and all you can think about is how nice it feels, and how you never want to move again.\u201d Midoriya scrubs a hand through his hair. \u201cExcept my brain never really shuts up, not even when I\u2019m in the bath, so when I\u2019m around you, it\u2019s even quieter than that.\u201d He makes a face at his collapsing metaphor. \u201cI said too much, didn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\u201cDo you want to sleep?\u201d Todoroki asks, unperturbed.\nMidoriya nods. Todoroki changes into his pyjamas with his back to Midoriya, and puts his dirty uniform in the fabric bag hanging by his door. When he turns back around, Midoriya is curled into the futon, eyes on the ceiling, face beet-red.\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be a tight squeeze in my room,\u201d Todoroki realises. \u201cSorry.\u201d\nMidoriya shakes his head, still not quite meeting Todoroki\u2019s eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s not that much of a difference in size. It just looks that way since my bed is elevated.\u201d\n\u201cYou seem uncomfortable. You don\u2019t have to stay here if you prefer your room.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Midoriya says, too quickly. If possible, his face heats up even more. \u201cI like it here. I\u2019ve just\u2014I\u2019ve never been in your room before, and I\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m adjusting!\u201d\nTodoroki slides into his futon. Their legs brush up against each other. Midoriya is wearing shorts, and Todoroki\u2019s sweatpants cut off after the knee. Midoriya\u2019s legs are warm and hairy, and the contact sends a jolt up Todoroki\u2019s spine, like an electric shock.\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Todoroki asks. Midoriya stares at him, frozen. Todoroki frowns. \u201cDid you come here because you were feeling overwrought again? Do you want to go to the gym?\u201d\nThat shakes Midoriya out of his reverie. He settles into the futon, trying to get comfortable, and Todoroki mimics him. Their legs don\u2019t brush again, but Todoroki feels hyper-aware of the distance between them.\n\u201cOverwrought,\u201d Midoriya says with a smile. Is he mocking Todoroki\u2019s word choice? \u201cNo. I\u2019m feeling a little anxious tonight, but I\u2019m anxious a lot of nights, and it\u2019s not something that can really be fixed by another person\u2019s presence. It\u2019s just\u2014I wanted\u2014I wanted to see you.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Todoroki says.\nMidoriya chews on the inside of his cheek. \u201cIs that\u2014should I not have come?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Todoroki says. \u201cI\u2019m glad you came. You\u2019re like a heating pad.\u201d\nMidoriya snorts into his half of the pillow. \u201cYour quirk is probably better at keeping you warm than I am.\u201d\nTodoroki almost says I prefer you, but the shared quiet of their dorm room, the few centimetres between their bare legs, the soft shifting of the blankets as they settle into the futon, makes him hold his tongue. It would be too honest to say. He\u2019s not entirely sure why, or what that means.\n\u201cIs it too warm?\u201d Todoroki says, instead. \u201cIf you feel overheated\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\u201cTell me if my quirk is bothering you.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t bother me, Todoroki.\u201d Midoriya smiles at him, but there\u2019s something about his eyes, the way his mouth is tilted up, that Todoroki can\u2019t quite understand.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTodoroki doesn\u2019t realise he\u2019s clutching at the back of Midoriya\u2019s pyjama shirt until he shifts his arm, and the shirt moves with him. He freezes, looks down. Midoriya is still asleep, though it\u2019s hard to tell at this angle; his face is tucked into Todoroki\u2019s chest. He can feel Midoriya\u2019s nose through his shirt. The pinched skin between his eyebrows. The warm puffs of air leaving his mouth as he sleeps. His curls brush against Todoroki\u2019s chin.\nTodoroki has his arms curled around him, holding him there. They must have moved in their sleep. Did Todoroki manoeuvre Midoriya in his sleep, his hand tangling in his shirt and tugging him close to him? Did Midoriya shift on his own? Or was it a mutual thing, the two of them edging closer together like magnets, seeking the warmth of each other\u2019s skin even while asleep?\nFor some reason, Todoroki is fascinated by that. His mind winds around in circles. He doesn\u2019t even think about moving, until Midoriya\u2019s breathing changes, and he wakes up, peeking up at Todoroki. He goes red.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d blurts Midoriya.\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d Todoroki realises his hand is still bunched in Midoriya\u2019s shirt. He lets go abruptly. \u201cI kind of like\u2014I mean. I\u2019m sorry, too.\u201d\nMidoriya\u2019s eyes are wide, but he doesn\u2019t immediately scramble off of Todoroki\u2019s chest. \u201cI\u2014I kind of. I kind of don\u2019t mind this,\u201d he manages after a moment, the words coming out half-strangled.\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind it, either,\u201d Todoroki says quickly. Too quickly. He sounds embarrassingly eager.\nMidoriya stays against his chest. For a few minutes, it\u2019s awkward. They\u2019re both stiff, like they\u2019re afraid of moving and disturbing the other, but they relax, bit by bit, until Todoroki is afraid he\u2019ll fall asleep again.\nHe\u2019ll miss class if that happens, but that\u2019s not what he\u2019s scared of; he\u2019s scared of missing this shared moment with Midoriya.\n\u201cYou\u2019re comfy,\u201d Midoriya mumbles into his shirt. \u201cIt\u2019s quiet.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not quiet. There are people bustling around in the neighbouring dorms. The boys downstairs are shouting, and Bakugou is setting off explosions that make people shriek and run around, their footsteps echoing up the stairwell. Midoriya must sense his confusion, because he bites at the inside of his cheek, then taps a finger against his temple.\n\u201cHere,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s quiet in here.\u201d\nTodoroki can\u2019t help the small smile that pulls at his lips. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m here for.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTodoroki has a rough training session. His flames won\u2019t listen to him. It\u2019s like they\u2019re an angry spirit he can\u2019t tame, rather than a product of his own body. He almost burns Hagakure, and Aizawa dresses him down in front of the entire class for his sloppy work.\nTodoroki doesn\u2019t mind the criticism or how public it is, but the feeling of fire under his skin, the uncontrollable fluctuation of his temperature when his quirk gets like this, leaves him unbalanced. It reminds him of long training sessions with Endeavour, pushing his body past its breaking point, until it gives up and refuses to listen to him.\nHis friends shoot him commiserating glances as they file off towards the showers after the run-down of their training session is over. Midoriya comes up to him, sweaty and streaked with soot from where he was caught up in one of Bakugou\u2019s explosions, and says, \u201cI\u2019ll see you tonight?\u201d\n\u201cYour room?\u201d Todoroki asks.\nMidoriya nods, offers him a blinding smile, then follows after his classmates towards the showers.\nYaoyorozu lingers after everyone else is gone. She was probably planning on seeing if he was alright, but now all she does is stare at Midoriya\u2019s retreating back. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d\n\u201cWhat was what?\u201d\nShe looks at him, then smiles. \u201cCongratulations, Todoroki.\u201d\n\u201cFor what?\u201d\nShe laughs behind her hand. \u201cI guess it\u2019s a little premature. Well, congratulations on your future happiness, then.\u201d\nShe heads to the changing rooms, and Todoroki is left staring after her, confused.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThat night, Todoroki knocks, and Midoriya calls, \u201cIt\u2019s open!\u201d\nMidoriya is already in bed, his laptop open on his knees. He pats the space next to him, and Todoroki climbs in. Midoriya inches closer to him, until they're just barely touching, angling the laptop so that Todoroki can see.\n\u201cYou said you hadn\u2019t seen any of the All Might movies, so I thought I\u2019d introduce you to my favourite one. It\u2019s not the most popular one\u2014that\u2019s the 2XXX one\u2014but that was 90 minutes of action for the sake of action, and it\u2019s overinflated budget was used to cast famous actors so they could sell more tickets.\u201d\nTodoroki settles more firmly against his pillow. Both of their beds have an extra pillow in them now, for nights like this. \u201cAnd your favourite?\u201d\n\u201cThe 2XXX one! Technically it\u2019s an off-shoot of My Hero Adventures, an anime that explored real life pros and their motivations for being a hero, but when they came around to featuring All Might, they gave him his own movie-length segment. It\u2019s animated so you don\u2019t have to adjust to seeing a different person dressed up as All Might\u2014which I can never really get over, honestly; other people just don\u2019t live up to his \u2026 well, everything, really. Oh, and the film also goes into detail about All Might\u2019s brand of heroism, and how important having a Symbol of Peace is.\u201d\nIt\u2019s warm here. Rather than the stippling flames hiding under his ribs, he feels Midoriya\u2019s body heat and the warmth of the laptop. He thinks about Midoriya\u2019s metaphor from last time they had done this.\n\nWhen you\u2019re having a warm bath, and all you can think about is how nice it feels, and how you never want to move again.\n\nHe had been right. The tension in his body is leaving, bit by bit, and all Todoroki can think about, beside the movie and the informative comments coming from Midoriya every few moments, is that he never wants to leave.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis time, Todoroki wakes up to his nose tucked against Midoriya\u2019s collarbone, his arm wrapped around his stomach. Their legs are twisted together. Todoroki\u2019s brain is too sleep-soft for that burst of electricity at the contact to manifest itself and fully pull him back into reality.\nMidoriya makes a noise in the back of his throat, and then arches his back, pushing his chest further into Todoroki\u2019s face. He can feel the planes of Midoriya\u2019s stomach like this, he realises. The outline of his abs. The hardness of ribs beneath muscle.\n\u201cTodoroki \u2026 \u201d\nHe squints through his fringe, taking in Midoriya\u2019s droopy face and his mussed bed-head. \u201cGood morning,\u201d he manages. His brain doesn\u2019t want to start. Everything feels so calm. \u201cShould I move?\u201d\nMidoriya\u2019s face reddens, but he shakes his head. \u201cYou\u2019re fine.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Todoroki lays his head back down on Midoriya\u2019s chest. A part of him thinks he should be embarrassed, but they\u2019ve woken up like this before. It\u2019s nothing new.\n\u201cDon\u2019t go back to sleep. We have to get up soon.\u201d\nTodoroki hums, but doesn\u2019t open his eyes. \u201cTell me about more about the All Might movies. What are the others like?\u201d\n\u201cYou liked that one last night?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\nMidoriya talks about the All Might movies in descending levels of fondness. When he loops back around to the mainstream one, there\u2019s a bitterness in his voice Todoroki hasn\u2019t ever heard before. Midoriya isn\u2019t one to hold grudges unless, it seems, it\u2019s about film franchises about All Might.\nWhen he feels awake enough, he rolls off of Midoriya and stretches out. Midoriya props himself up beside him. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d\n\u201cBetter, today. How are you? Did you sleep okay?\u201d\nMidoriya is still a little red. He blushes so easily. \u201cYou\u2019re very warm. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever slept that well before.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to be your hot water bottle,\u201d Todoroki says.\nMidoriya hides his face in the mattress. At this point, Todoroki is so used to this that he laughs. Midoriya peeks up at him. The expression on his face\u2014Todoroki stops laughing. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t laugh often,\u201d Midoriya says quietly. He swallows. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2026 really nice.\u201d\nAnother smile tugs at his lips. \u201cI\u2019ll do it more, then.\u201d\nMidoriya nods, oddly subdued. \u201cPlease do.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTodoroki doesn\u2019t have a reason for heading to Midoriya\u2019s room. He spends most nights in his own, but after two months of this, it feels natural to wonder to Midoriya\u2019s, knock once, and let himself in.\nMidoriya holds his laptop up long enough for Todoroki to climb over him to the other side of the bed, settling in between Midoriya and the wall.\n\u201cWhat are we watching?\u201d\nMidoriya props his laptop between them. He has a journal open, and a pen in hand, ink blots running down one palm. \u201cHero analysis. My favourite YouTuber just uploaded a new one about Best Jeanist. Do you mind?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Go ahead.\u201d\nMidoriya presses play again. Without thinking, Todoroki uses his quirk to heat up his half of the bed. Warmth spreads through white linen, and Midoriya sighs, sinking deeper into his pillow, and edges closer to Todoroki. \u201cI\u2019m going to fall asleep if you keep that up.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that the point of our arrangement?\u201d\n\u201cThis video is half an hour long, and they haven\u2019t even started the analysis on fighting techniques yet.\u201d\nTodoroki stays quiet, and heats up the bed a little more. Midoriya throws his pen at him.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA fist pounds on the door.\nMidoriya jolts awake, and Todoroki tightens his hold on him, stopping him from getting out of bed. Todoroki doesn\u2019t want Midoriya to move, unless it\u2019s to get even closer.\nVoices can be heard from outside the room. Todoroki blearily recognises them as Iida, Uraraka, and Kirishima.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t polite. We should wait until Midoriya opens the door, and then\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no time for politeness, Iida! Aizawa is handing out detentions left and right. Deku\u2019s freedom is at stake here.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, dude, it\u2019s our responsibility to fetch our friend before he gets in trouble.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe, but we shouldn\u2019t just barge into his room\u2014\u201d\nThe knob turns, and the three of them\u2014all dressed in their pyjamas with their hair in various states of disarray\u2014tumble through the doorway and land face first on the floor. They look up, see Midoriya staring back at them with huge eyes, see a sleepy Todoroki nosing into his collarbone, and then scramble back to their feet.\n\u201cDude,\u201d Kirishima says, grinning.\n\u201cDeku!\u201d Uraraka bounces on the tips of her toes. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t tell me that you\u2019re dating Todoroki. We\u2019re your best friends!\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell either of us?\u201d Iida says, echoing Uraraka.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Midoriya squeaks.\nIida sighs while Uraraka laughs, their frustration with Midoriya fading away immediately. \u201cCongratulations, regardless. You two are good together.\u201d\nMidoriya\u2019s voice is strangled. \u201cThis isn\u2019t\u2014it isn\u2019t what it looks like, I swear.\u201d\nIt is far too early for this. Todoroki makes a disgruntled noise in the back of his throat, and pulls Midoriya closer to him, rubbing his cool nose against the soft skin of Midoriya\u2019s throat, trying to get comfortable again. He can\u2019t see Midoriya\u2019s face from his angle, but he feels the way he relaxes under Todoroki, melting like ice left out in the sun.\n\u201cMan,\u201d Kirishima complains, \u201cnow I just feel jealous.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be jealous of,\u201d Midoriya says.\n\u201cExcept for the seventy kilos of pretty boy on top of you.\u201d\nUraraka snickers. \u201cGet it, Midoriya.\u201d\nTodoroki takes his head off of Midoriya\u2019s chest long enough to watch Uraraka and Kirishima high-five, and then turn to Midoriya, their hands up, expecting a high-five from him, too. Beside them, Iida opens and closes his mouth, like he\u2019s not sure if he should scold them or join them in their teasing. Midoriya\u2019s blush creeps down his neck and spreads across his collarbone.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really not like that,\u201d Midoriya says again.\nSomeone that sounds suspiciously like Hagakure shouts down the hallway, \u201cTodoroki and Midoriya are boning!\u201d\nTodoroki hadn\u2019t even noticed her poking her head through the doorway.\nMidoriya rips himself away from Todoroki, and stumbles getting out of bed, legs tangled in the sheets. He manages to stay upright through sheer force of will. He flails his hands around. \u201cWe\u2019re not sleeping together! I mean, technically we are sleeping together, but it\u2019s not like that! We\u2019re friends. Friends who sleep together. Lying next to each other and just sleeping.\u201d\nKirishima just keeps smiling that overjoyed, toothy smile. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to hide it, dude. Joking aside, your love is incredibly inspiring and manly, and I\u2019m sure everyone will be supportive, or at least very jealous.\u201d\nTodoroki watches from the bed, still swathed in blankets, blinking his eyes slowly like a cat.\n\u201cWe\u2019re happy for you,\u201d Iida agrees, and Uraraka nods, her unbrushed hair bouncing around her face.\nAt that moment, a group of people fall into Midoriya\u2019s room, almost bowling over the three of them. Todoroki stares down at the pile of pyjama clad classmates. He really wants to go back to sleep\u2014Midoriya is comfortable and warm, though that last part might be due to his darkening blush\u2014but that doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019ll be happening anytime soon.\nIt\u2019s way, way too early for this.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAizawa stands in the common room, scowling at his congregated students. His arms are crossed over his fleece pyjamas. His eyes are more bloodshot than usual.\n\u201cThis was a drill. If this was a real emergency, you\u2019d all be dead.\u201d\nYaoyorozu raises a hand in the air. \u201cSir, no alarms went off.\u201d\n\u201cVillains might switch off the power in the case of an infiltration. UA has backup generators, but they are not faultless, especially considering power-centred quirks.\u201d His eyes dart briefly to Kaminari, who has tripped the main power for the dorms more than once. \u201cIf it\u2019s possible, alarms will be set off, but you need to know how to evacuate yourself and your classmates without them.\u201d\nThe class shuffles in place. Not only had they failed to evacuate quickly, they had spent almost twenty minutes running around the dorms and yelling about how early it was, trying to work out what was happening, and why Todoroki was in Midoriya\u2019s room.\nAizawa looks at Midoriya and Todoroki. Midoriya gulps audibly.\n\u201cAnd normally, students are supposed to be in their own dorm rooms.\u201d\n\u201cSir,\u201d Todoroki says, ready to argue.\nAizawa raises a hand to stop him. \u201cEveryone else go and get ready for class. You\u2019re all expected to be in homeroom at the normal time. Midoriya and Todoroki, stay behind.\u201d\nThe class filters out, shooting them conspicuous glances. Jirou might have attempted to eavesdrop if Aizawa hadn\u2019t been there, more than ready to dish out detentions.\nWhen the common room is empty, Aizawa sighs and pushes his hair out of his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s always you, isn\u2019t it, Midoriya?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d Midoriya says. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s Kacchan.\u201d\nAizawa ignores him. \u201cStudents living in the dorm are generally expected to sleep in their own rooms. It isn\u2019t an official rule, but it is an established part of dorm etiquette.\u201d\nMidoriya looks down at his bare feet, but Todoroki squares his shoulders. \u201cAre you going to make us stop?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Aizawa says. \u201cIs this arrangement sexual?\u201d\nMidoriya\u2019s face is bright pink. Todoroki thinks his might be, too. This is not a conversation he ever wanted to have, especially not this early.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d Todoroki says, making sure to meet Aizawa\u2019s gaze, even if his face is burning.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Aizawa says. \u201cI believe you, and I trust both of you to be safe and smart if anything like that does occur, later on. If you need a refresher on sex ed, you can go to Recovery Girl or Midnight or, if it makes you more comfortable, you can talk to me if you need.\u201d They both nod, their eyes on their feet. \u201cNow. What happened?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Midoriya asks.\n\u201cYou were both coming to class exhausted a few months ago. You\u2019re not, now.\u201d\nTodoroki considers telling Aizawa that he had found Midoriya in the gym, shaking from overexertion, pushing himself far past his limits, but that\u2019s not his story to tell. It\u2019s up to Midoriya whether or not he\u2019ll share his troubles with Aizawa.\n\u201cI have nightmares,\u201d Todoroki says instead. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to be in my room after them. It brings up memories. And Midoriya has his own reasons for struggling with sleep.\u201d\nAizawa looks to Midoriya, who smiles sheepishly. \u201cTodoroki found me in the dorm gym a few months ago, and managed to shake some sense into me.\u201d\n\u201cWe have an arrangement,\u201d Todoroki says. \u201cA platonic arrangement.\u201d\nAizawa snorts like he doesn\u2019t believe them, but doesn\u2019t ban them from going anywhere near each other, which Todoroki had feared, almost irrationally.\n\u201cIt\u2019s logical that you deal with this similar issue together. If you have further issues with insomnia and nightmares, there are on-campus counsellors you can talk to, not to mention a host of other resources. You can also talk to me. Or All Might.\u201d\nMidoriya looks at the floor, and mumbles, \u201cI didn\u2019t really want him to know.\u201d\n\u201cIf something is bothering you, especially if it concerns him, you should talk to him,\u201d Aizawa says.\nAizawa walks a fine line between giving them space and not talking down to them, and giving them the support and discipline they need. Todoroki, who has lived in a chokehold most of his life, is continually left unbalanced by it.\n\u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d Midoriya says.\nAizawa waves a hand to dismiss them. \u201cGood. Now go get ready for class.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKirishima stops them on their way back to their dorm rooms. He\u2019s wearing his collared shirt and tie over a pair of pyjama pants.\n\u201cI just wanted to say I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Kirishima says, scrubbing a hand through his loose hair. \u201cIida was right\u2014we shouldn\u2019t have barged into your room like that. Or teased you like that and made you uncomfortable.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d Midoriya says, waving his hands around. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m okay. Todoroki?\u201d\n\u201cI think you made Midoriya uncomfortable,\u201d Todoroki says, and ignores the way Midoriya opens his mouth to try and argue. \u201cYou should probably be careful with that in the future. But otherwise, I didn\u2019t have a problem with it.\u201d\nKirishima nods, looking far too determined for someone still half in their pyjamas. \u201cGot it. I\u2019ll tell our classmates to back off a little, too.\u201d\nTodoroki still has to get ready for class, but he follows Midoriya back to his dorm room. A part of him wants nothing more than to climb back into Midoriya\u2019s bed, chasing the cooling body heat left behind on his crumpled sheets, and go back to sleep, preferably while curled around Midoriya. But they have class in less than an hour, and Todoroki doesn\u2019t think Midoriya can sleep, given how nervous he looks, glancing between the closed door and Todoroki.\nTodoroki takes a seat on the bed. Midoriya joins him. Their knees bump.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry about that,\u201d Midoriya blurts, pulling at his fingers. \u201cI\u2019m really not sure how everyone came to that conclusion, that we aren\u2019t friends. Are more than friends. Are dating. I mean, you\u2019re clearly out of my league, and I\u2019m me, so I really don\u2019t\u2014\u201d\nTodoroki has no idea how he somehow got himself into a cuddle-buddy arrangement with Midoriya but he's not questioning it. In fact, he quite likes it.\nExcept that\u2019s not true. He knows how he got to this point. And yet, he\u2019s baffled by the ease with which they\u2019ve fallen into a routine, the unobtrusive way they fall against each other when they crawl into bed, the way smiles come to him without effort when they\u2019re like this, alone together. The way he knows instinctively that Midoriya is judging himself against Todoroki and finding himself wanting.\nHe doesn\u2019t know how Midoriya can think like that\u2014he\u2019s amazing\u2014but he understands how Midoriya views the world and his place in it. He knows how Midoriya views himself, as plain and easily overlooked, and it\u2019s so beyond anything that Todoroki knows about him that he can\u2019t let that sit.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to apologise,\u201d Todoroki says. \u201cKirishima already did that. And \u2026 and you\u2019re not out of my league. I\u2019d be honoured to be in a relationship with you. You\u2019re\u2014\u201d\nTodoroki closes his mouth, and turns away. That\u2019s too much. Midoriya is a friend, and Todoroki may be a little awkward when it comes to social interactions, but he knows he probably shouldn\u2019t tell a friend how strong, and intelligent, and kind, and attractive you find them. That seems invasive.\nInvasive. As though they haven\u2019t been sharing a bed for weeks.\n\u201cTodoroki,\u201d Midoriya says quietly.\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019m the one that\u2019s been taking advantage of your kindness, all this time. Maybe this is a burden on you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want this to stop,\u201d Midoriya blurts, and then colours. He sucks in a breath, steadying himself, before continuing, \u201cI\u2019ve really enjoyed spending time with you. I\u2019ve even found it difficult to sleep sometimes, when I\u2019m alone. Is that weird?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Todoroki says, thinking about the nights he\u2019s spent in his own room, sliding a hand over the cold side of his futon, disorientated at finding it empty, Midoriya out of reach. \u201cI feel the same way.\u201d\nThey stare at each other for a moment. The sound of their classmates moving around the neighbouring dorm rooms remind them that they need to get ready for class soon. The AC whirs overhead. Todoroki\u2019s heart is racing in his chest, and he wonders, irrationally, if Midoriya can hear it.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to correct anyone if they assume we\u2019re together\u2014\u201d Midoriya says, at the same time that Todoroki says, \u201cWould you go on a date with me?\u201d\nThey both freeze. Midoriya\u2019s eyes are wide.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Todoroki says quickly. If possible, his heart speeds up. It\u2019s going to beat right out of his chest.\n\u201cNo!\u201d Midoriya waves his hands around in the air. \u201cI mean, yes! A date would be\u2014I would like to go on a date. As long as you want to, that is. That would be, uh. That would be really nice.\u201d\nA knot of tension unwinds in Todoroki\u2019s chest. \u201cYou\u2019re saying yes?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m saying yes.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re dating, then,\u201d Todoroki says.\nThey stare at each other again. Midoriya\u2019s cheeks are still pink, but he\u2019s smiling, and Todoroki realises that he\u2019s smiling too. He\u2019s not sure how long they sit there, smiling at each other. Someone bangs at the door, and they startle.\n\u201cCome on, guys,\u201d Kirishima says from the other side of the door. \u201cYou\u2019re going to miss class, and Aizawa is already mad enough.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t rush them,\u201d Jirou says. \u201cThey need time to cover up their hickies.\u201d\nMidoriya jumps to his feet. \u201cThere are no hickies!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what everyone with hickies says,\u201d Ashido says, laughing.\n\u201cI told you guys not to tease them!\u201d Kirishima says.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Ashido and Jirou chorus.\n\u201cWe should confirm with them that we are dating,\u201d Todoroki says. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019re all curious, now. Would you be okay with that?\u201d\nMidoriya goes pink and shy at the reminder that they\u2019re dating. Todoroki has already begun to brainstorm date ideas.\nThe sun has only just risen outside, but already, Todoroki is looking forward to going to bed tonight. To seeing, again, what Midoriya looks like when he sleeps, what his curls feel like pressed up against his cheek, what it\u2019s like to dream next to him. To waking up beside him.\nMidoriya reaches out and takes his hand. After months of sleeping beside one another, of leg brushes that cause electricity to race down his spine, of waking up tangled together in the mornings, of breathing each other\u2019s air, the feel of their fingers threading together shouldn\u2019t make Todoroki\u2019s heart race. It shouldn\u2019t make him feel dizzy with happiness.\nBut it does.\n\u00a0"
