    "text": "\u00a0\n\u201cI hope I\u2019ve done enough good things in life to be rewarded by waking up on the rolling hills of Bokuto Koutarou\u2019s pecs after I die.\u201d\nDo people think like this? Atsumu is suddenly forced to confront the reality that people do think like this. Then they put these wretched ideas out in the world by posting them on social media. These terrible, terrible words have just left his mouth because\u2014as the consequence of the thoughtless social media-using, Bokuto\u2019s pecs-loving masses\u2019 actions\u2014this thought is now on a piece of paper in Atsumu\u2019s hands, which he must read out on camera.  On camera. His mother will watch this video. Kita will watch this video. Osamu will watch this video, then he will make sure his mother and Kita end up watching this video.\n\u201cWow, that\u2019s sweet, Bokuto-san!\u201d Shouyou goes. He is beautiful but in times like this even he makes Atsumu want to die.\n\u201cIt is, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Bokuto seems equally enthused about the degenerate state of the world. His voice is at least a thousand decibels louder than strictly necessary. \u201cBut Twitter user Meian Shugo\u2019s cumsock! Did you know?  Did you know? You don\u2019t have to die! My boyfriend, Akaashi Keiji, wakes up on the rolling hills of my pecs all the time!\u201d\nAtsumu looks at the floor and mouths the words  Meian Shugo\u2019s cumsock.\n\u201cThat\u2019s also really sweet, Bokuto-san!\u201d Shouyou goes on, completely oblivious to the crablike sideways motion of Sakusa in his chair, who appears to be trying to put as much distance between himself and his three teammates as possible. Unfortunately he is limited by the size of the video frame, a boundary enforced by the stern glare of the cameraman.\u00a0\nAtsumu is still trying to wrestle his soul back into his body. He had wanted adoring fans when he started playing professionally. Somewhere, a finger had curled in on a monkey\u2019s paw.\n\u201cMoving on,\u201d Sakusa says with a cough, looking like he very much wishes they did not have anything to move on to. They have not allowed him to wear a mask for the duration of his video. Atsumu has never seen his mouth for so long in a non-game setting, and the shape of it is admittedly unsettling. There\u2019s a cruel twist that remains there even when his face is completely neutral. Like now, when he is reaching into the bucket and unfolding a piece of paper.\nSakusa stares at it. He adopts the face he makes whenever he disapproves of the way Atsumu unwraps his store-bought onigiri, which is every time. Atsumu thinks it\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t carry around a tiny bottle of seventy percent ethanol hand sanitizer with him all the time like Sakusa does. He had asked him whether this was the case\u2014Sakusa had not answered\u2014then told him not everyone can be a freak like you, Omi-kun, and Sakusa had stepped on his foot. It turns out Sakusa Kiyoomi is capable of focusing most of his strength in his heel. Freakish feats of the freakish body\u2014go figure.\n\u201cWell, Sakusa-san? What is it?\u201d Shouyou\u2019s eyes are wide. They sparkle.\n\u201cYes! Read it read it read it read it read it.\u201d This is Bokuto, no doubt already thinking of another anecdote about his boyfriend, Akaashi Keiji, to share with the class.\nSakusa inhales sharply and spares Atsumu a narrowed sideways glance.\n\u201cDid you see that setter dump just now,\u201d Sakusa says without a question mark. \u201cAtsumu hi you are free to ram your sixteen-inch accent in my throat until I choke, then keep thrusting, shut me up baby. Hashtag Jackals vee ess Adlers.\u201d\n\u201cAtsumu-san!\u201d Shouyou turns to him, beaming, two palms in the air. Atsumu high tens him. Oh yeah. Now we\u2019re talking.\nHe spins to point an accusing finger right in Sakusa\u2019s chest. \u201cOmi-omi, couldya find a  more  unsexy way to read that line? You\u2019ve never heard of a thing called intonation?\u201d He leans forward. Sakusa leans back.\nSakusa narrows his eyes even more and they engage for a stare-off for about ten seconds to the sound of Bokuto and Shouyou egging them on. The position is not starting to strain his abdominals, because Atsumu is a professional athlete with exceptional core muscles.\u00a0\n\u201cFine.\u201d\u00a0\nSakusa leans forward a little. He destroys the perfect parallel alignment of their torsos. There\u2019s that twist of his mouth again. \u201cAtsumu, you are free to ram your sixteen-inch accent into my throat until I choke,\u201d he purrs. Sakusa\u2019s eyes are very dark naturally, sucking in all surrounding rays of light and crushing them in his pupils. For an athlete, he is rather pale. His lips look very pink in comparison. Atsumu is suddenly catastrophically aware that in this instance, \u2018accent\u2019 is a euphemism. \u201cGood enough for your Olympic-size ego, Miya?\u201d\nAtsumu straightens up. He ignores the heat rising to his treacherous face.  Osamu is going to watch this video. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s how ya do it.\u201d\n\u201cOkay now it\u2019s  my turn, \u201d Bokuto announces from the other side of the frame, having missed Atsumu\u2019s experience of being sucked through a wormhole and spit out as a shredded glob of human flesh. \u201cOoh, my disciple! It\u2019s about you! Look: I need Hinata Shouyou to crush my windpipe with his perfectly tanned thigh muscles and beep me so hard I emerge from the ground in Rio! Wow!\u201d\n\u201cDid you just censor yourself,\u201d Sakusa says.\n\u201cThere are children watching, Sakusa-san,\u201d Shouyou responds earnestly. Sakusa protests this. The video will be entitled  thirst tweets, he argues. Shouyou ignores him. \u201cBut also, whoever this is, uh, at Hinata-ta-tas, I don\u2019t want your throat to be crushed by my thighs. We won\u2019t be able to have any fun afterwards!\u201d\nShouyou does have very nice, sun-browned thighs. Atsumu steals a glance at them. Fun. Shouyou is all about fun, unlike Sakusa, who is all about not-fun.\n\u201cWe should have fun all the way to Rio, Shouyou-kun,\u201d Atsumu\u2019s mouth supplies without the input of his brain. Shouyou grins beatifically at him. His teeth are ever so slightly crooked; his smile is unbearably adorable.\n\u201cWith your sixteen-inch-accent, Atsumu-san?\u201d\n\u201cYep!\u201d\n\u201cGet a room.\u201d Sakusa\u2019s teeth are audibly clenched.\nShouyou opens another slip of paper. \u201cOh, to be Miya Atsumu, receiving dirty looks and biting insults from Sakusa Kiyoomi whenever you\u2019re within ten meters of him,\u201d he says. He laughs, bright and carefree, and Atsumu can\u2019t even be mad at him. Bokuto joins in on the chortling.\n\u201cHow is  that  a thirst tweet?\u201d Atsumu demands. Sakusa grumbles something about Atsumu being shrill.\n\u201cWait, Atsumu-san! There\u2019s a follow up!\u201d He clears his throat. \u201cI wonder if Sakusa smacks Miya with his abnormally flexible wrists? OH TO BE MIYA ATSUMU.\u201d\nAtsumu cranes his neck to look at the paper in Shouyou\u2019s hands. The capital letters, they are there in the tweet. Real monkey\u2019s paw stuff. He would  not  enjoy getting smacked by Sakusa. Who would enjoy that? First of all, that\u2019s not even widely accepted as sexy, like spankings are. Second of all, Sakusa wouldn\u2019t even put any energy into it. There\u2019s going to be such an intense lack of enthusiasm that the shockwave from it would shut down all the BDSM clubs in a seventy-kilometer radius.\n\u201cOh my god can Kiyoomi-kun just spike a wickedly curving volleyball up my ass already? Asking for a friend,\u201d Bokuto reads.\n\u201cThat is\u2014horribly unhygienic.\u201d Sakusa sounds like a robot that\u2019s short-circuiting. While being strangled with its own cables. \u201cNot to mention\u2014completely physically impossible.\u201d\nWould Atsumu enjoy being smacked by Sakusa, if Sakusa was passionate about it? But then that wouldn\u2019t be very Sakusa-like, would it?\nShouyou chimes in without missing a beat, having unfolded another piece of paper: \u201cHow do you look at Sakusa\u2019s marble countenance and luscious curls and not want him to spit in your mouth, intense germaphobia notwithstanding? Oh wow, Sakusa-san, you\u2019re on a roll!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d like to get off this roll.\u201d\nMarble countenance. He is rather statue-like, in a way. It would be fitting for him to be very stoic. Atsumu takes back the bit about no enthusiasm. Sakusa\u2019s the type to carry on with his conversation like nothing is happening while you blow him under a desk. He would hit you with a riding crop and not even spare you a glance.\n\u201cAugh,\u201d Atsumu says in despair. Somehow he has arrived at the point of thinking about giving Sakusa head under a desk. Does he want to do that? Really?\n\u201cYou okay, Atsumu? How \u2018bout you read out the next one?\u201d Bokuto shoves the bucket of tweets in front of his face. Gingerly, Atsumu picks one out. Please don\u2019t let it be about Sakusa, he prays to Kita\u2019s gods. Please, if he has done anything good in this world, ever, don\u2019t make him read out a statement of concentrated horniness about the teammate he may be having horny thoughts about (the jury is still out).\nIt\u2019s about Sakusa. It is true that Atsumu has never done anything good.\n\u201cIf Sakusa Kiyoomi choked me with his hands then spritzed hand sanitizer on them afterwards I think I\u2019d actually come untouched,\u201d he forces out. Despite Atsumu\u2019s earlier effort to wrestle his soul back into his body, it has now decided to take a permanent vacation. He glances at Sakusa, who grimaces like he\u2019s been told to take a bath in a dumpster.\n\u201cThese thirst tweets seem really painful,\u201d Shouyou observes, astutely. \u201cIs that what people are into these days?\u201d\n\u201cMy boyfriend, Akaashi Keiji, says all kinks are valid!\u201d Bokuto has reached into the cursed bucket again. \u201cAh. This one is better! It\u2019s from Twitter user Dumbass Hinata. Oh, that seems mean.\u201d\n\u201cWhat does it say.\u201d Sakusa, having recovered from his dumpster bath, rejoins the conversation.\u00a0\n\u201cI hate Hinata Shouyou\u2019s stupid perfect receives and great emergency sets and lightning spikes. I\u2019m going to beat him to the ground and kiss him on the mouth.\u201d There\u2019s a moment of silence. Atsumu squints. \u201cThat seems contradictory. Am I using that right?\u201d\n\u201cYes, Bokkun.\u201d\n\u201cTwitter user Dumbass Hinata?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what it says.\u201d\n\u201cWho could it be,\u201d Shouyou says, because he is absolutely brilliant in every way except this one.\nSakusa grabs the bucket from Bokuto and plucks out a single piece of paper, unilaterally deciding that this will be the last one. Atsumu knows because Sakusa announces this. The cameraman protests, citing the still partially-filled bucket in Sakusa\u2019s hands. Sakusa says, a bit more loudly, that this is the last one. He looks at the cameraman like he plans to step on him on the way out of the studio. Atsumu feels a tingle go up his spine.\nOh, fuck.\n\u201cHm.\u201d Sakusa is actually smiling a little bit. It\u2019s the tiny smug smirk he reserves for getting his service aces in before Atsumu. Atsumu hates it.\n\u201cWell? What does it say, Omi-omi?\u201d\n\u201cMiya Atsumu is whatever,\u201d Sakusa utters flatly. Suddenly the pace and tone of his voice picks up. Atsumu has never seen him this lively; it\u2019s terrifying. \u201cBut holy shit have you seen his twin?  Hot, water drops emoji water drops emoji,  entrepreneurial,\u00a0money bag emoji money bag emoji,  and he cooks, tongue emoji tongue emoji.\u201d\nAtsumu explodes out of his chair. Sakusa has defaulted back to his usual flat expression, showing no reaction whatsoever to Atsumu\u2019s physical protest.\n\u201cThis disrespect!\u201d he cries, completely justified in his outrage. \u201cWhy am  I  not heckin\u2019 entre-pre-neurial?  Huh?\u201d\n\u201cBecause you are a professional volleyball player, Miya.\u201d\n\u201cHeckin\u2019,\u201d Bokuto enunciates, rolling the word around in his mouth in a terrible impersonation of Atsumu\u2019s sixteen-inch accent. Atsumu glares at him.\n\u201cThey called \u2018Samu hot!  We have the same face!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Bokuto mutters thoughtfully, like he\u2019s pondering a particularly troubling philosophical question.\n\u201cAnd I work out more than he does!\u201d\n\u201cAtsumu-san, I think you\u2019re hot too, even though you can\u2019t cook and don\u2019t own a business,\u201d Shouyou says, patting a calming hand on his arm, but Atsumu does not feel like being calmed down right now, not even by the tanned redheaded ninja angel Hinata Shouyou.\nHe huffs. \u201cThanks, Shouyou-kun. But these thirst tweets have been disrespectin\u2019 me all day. Ya know what?\u201d He addresses a sweeping glance to the other four in the room. Sakusa is inspecting his nails. \u201cI\u2019m done. They won\u2019t be disrespectin\u2019 me no more.\u201d\nHe stomps off the set to the sound of Bokuto and Shouyou\u2019s protests and the vague clattering of the remaining slips of paper in the bucket as it is being shaken in Bokuto\u2019s large hands. The cameraman appears to have given up in trying to maintain any semblance of control over the situation.\nAnyone watching the video would think he is just throwing a tantrum. This is not untrue. But also, Atsumu is making the very wise decision to leave on his own terms before these terrible fruits of the internet force him to further reconsider the attractiveness of Sakusa Kiyoomi. Does he  want  to be choked by Sakusa, who would spritz his hands with hand sanitizer afterwards?  Does he? \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt takes him three hours to decide whether or not to call Osamu on the day the video goes up. Osamu is in Sendai, tied up in the complexities of opening another Onigiri Miya branch. He is being entrepreneurial. He is cooking. He is, apparently, hot. Atsumu is in Tokyo, having a crisis while shoving cup ramen in his mouth.\nIt takes him three hours to fret to himself about calling Osamu, and then Osamu renders them completely redundant by calling him anyway.\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Osamu does not give him the time to say hi.\n\u201cWhat was what,\u201d Atsumu says innocently.\n\u201cFuck you, \u2018Tsumu. What was that, in the video about the tweets. With Sakusa.\u201d\nHe had hoped Osamu wouldn\u2019t notice, but of course that had been stupid. He can still hold out hope that this is because of Osamu\u2019s twin senses, and that no one who is not Osamu will be able to grasp what transpired in Atsumu\u2019s head while the video was being shot.\nAtsumu loads the video and looks at the comments.\n\u00a0\nMSBABYBlackJ\noh my god 06:24 miya and sakusa were literally about to frick frack paddy whack\n\nninjashoumethemoney in reply to MSBABYBlackJ\nforget THAT did you see miya just casually ask hinata if he was down for some dickin at 07:19\n\nBokutoBuns in reply to ninjashoumethemoney\u00a0\nif this is what a ten minute video in a clean studio is like i shudder to think of the sexual tension in the black jackals locker room\n\nBokutoBuns\u00a0\nno one:\nabsolutely no one:\nBokuto Koutarou: MY BOYFRIEND, AKAASHI KEIJI\n\ngaybabyJail \u00a0\nMiya Atsumu is a walking talking volleyball tossing Sakusa Kiyoomi and Hinata Shouyou thirst tweet send comment\n\nhigh__larious32 in reply to gaybabyJail \u00a0\nwe are all Miya Atsumu. Except for the volleyball tossing.\n\nSunaRinMoonaRin in reply to gaybabyJail\nHow is it possible for them to make a video about thirst tweets, and atsumu is still thirstier than all the tweets combined\n\nOnigiriMiyaOfficial \u00a0\nAtsumu\u2026\n\u00a0\nThe level of mortification you find yourself on once you realize the entire internet knows you\u2019re horny is some kind of embarrassment nirvana.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Atsumu groans. \u201cI was disgusted about the tweets at first, I swear, but after a few of \u2018em about him I just started\u2026 considerin\u2019 it.\u201d\nIt is a given that, being a professional athlete, you are around other young people at peak physical condition all the time. Atsumu is not new to the idea that his teammates are attractive. There\u2019s Bokuto, who, rolling pectoral hills aside, has a truly impressive back that demands attention even when he isn\u2019t spiking. There\u2019s Meian, who can awaken daddy issues in people who have perfectly uncomplicated relationships with their fathers. Inunaki\u2019s fluffy head of hair. Thomas and Barnes, over six-foot-five of corded muscle. And of course, there\u2019s Hinata Shouyou, who will wrestle all the things you thought were your fantasies from you and make them all about him.\n\u201cI guess if yer a goth, he\u2019s got that\u2026 pale skin, dark hair thing\u2026? Like a vampire?\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t like vampires, \u2018Tsumu,\u201d Osamu informs him. \u201cYou were Team Jacob.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not about attractiveness, is it? Being around someone attractive and being attracted to someone are two different things. Atsumu is around Bokuto, but he forgets about his physique and winning grin most of the time. Being attracted to someone is the exact opposite. He thought about Sakusa with a riding crop  once  and now the image of him will not leave Atsumu\u2019s brain even when the actual person isn\u2019t around.\n\u201cHe\u2019s the one with the Tepika bottles, right? The germaphobe?\u201d Osamu asks. Atsumu responds in the affirmative. \u201cDoes he clean, \u2018Tsumu?\u201d\n\u201cWhat kind of question is that.\u201d Atsumu sighs. \u201cYeah, he cleans.\u201d\n\u201cHmmm.\u201d\n\u201cOh, shut up, \u2018Samu.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBy the time his graduation rolled around, everyone on the Inarizaki volleyball team had had the grace to get over their crushes on Kita Shinsuke. With the exception of Atsumu, of course, because he was in possession of many things\u2014the best setter skills in all of Japan, hair that would put a bottle of mustard to shame, and ass cheeks rounder than a pair of Mikasa volleyballs\u2014but grace was conspicuously not among them.\nTherefore, Atsumu had a plan. He had ordered a bouquet of fifty ruby red roses. He had rented a deep maroon suit and put on his father\u2019s best brogues. He had used up Osamu\u2019s pot of hair gel trying out several different hairstyles and arrived at the perfect combination of expensive-looking poise and rakish allure.\n\u201cDo ya need someone to tell ya that ya look like a rat?\u201d Osamu asked. Then, without waiting for Atsumu\u2019s response: \u201c\u2018Cause I got some free time, so. Ya look like a rat.\u201d\nAtsumu stuck his tongue out at him. He was high on love and Osamu\u2019s deliberately mean jabs would not bring him down. He would give Kita the roses, confess his undying devotion, then secure a lifetime\u2019s supply of pickled plums and messages that reminded him to go to bed on time.\nSuna yawned. \u201cYou're still planning to confess? Can you even take rejection? Don\u2019t eat those roses when he turns you down, you hear?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not gonna reject me,\u201d Atsumu said. \u201cKita-san loves me.\u201d\n\u201cLet him do what he wants.\u201d Aran was smiling. It was impossible to tell whether or not he was on Atsumu\u2019s side.\nAfter each of the others had given their graduation gifts to Kita, Atsumu walked over to him. Kita\u2019s appearance that day did not deviate much from the way he looked at school, but that was Kita for you. It was not that he wasn\u2019t sufficiently tidy for his graduation; it was that he was graduation-level tidy even on regular school days.\nHe looked straight at Atsumu, and the noisy world went still.\nThe last gift exchanged between them had been Kita\u2019s jersey to Atsumu after the Spring Interhighs, right after they\u2019d lost to Karasuno. Atsumu had put it on and worn it home. Osamu spent the entire trip telling him he was disgusting.\nNow, Atsumu put his right foot forward and presented the bouquet to Kita, who took it in his well-maintained hands. He looked at the roses with a small smile. Emboldened, Atsumu went ahead with his confession: \u201cCongratulations on finishing high school, Kita-san. I\u2019m sure ya have a bright and promising future ahead of ya. Throughout the years we\u2019ve known each other you\u2019ve been makin\u2019 me\u2014makin\u2019 us all\u2014better people. You\u2019re the most perfect person I know. I love you.\u201d\nKita looked up from the roses, turning his serene smile to Atsumu.\n\u201cI love you too, Atsumu,\u201d he said calmly, but he didn\u2019t have to elaborate. Not in that way, Atsumu knew, without another word of explanation coming out of Kita\u2019s mouth. It was the gentlest rejection a man could give. \u201cBut why?\u201d\n\u201cWhy what?\u201d Atsumu asked as the pieces of his heart moved up and lodged themselves in the walls of his throat.\n\u201cWhy do you love me?\u201d Kita asked. He played with the petal of one flower in his hand. \u201cAnd what makes ya think I\u2019d like roses?\u201d\nUsually, when Kita had read something in Atsumu, he\u2019d spell it out. This time, his smile had taken on another quality altogether, one Atsumu couldn\u2019t decipher. He should\u2019ve known Kita wouldn\u2019t like roses. They flew apart and dropped petals, which Kita would feel the need to clean up later. They died and became trash.\nAtsumu had loved Kita Shinsuke because he was the most perfect person he knew. Atsumu had loved Kita Shinsuke because, while Atsumu got attention in the form of shrieking from the stands, he didn\u2019t actually feel it. There was one time he\u2019d felt like someone really paid him attention: when he\u2019d overexerted himself, and Kita had told the team not to praise him for neglecting his health.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLoving Kita hadn\u2019t really been about the cleaning, so Osamu is wrong. Correlation does not equal causation, hence why Osamu is now selling onigiri and not deciding economic policy, or something. So what is this new obsession with Sakusa really about? Is it really about getting a volleyball spiked up his ass?\n\u201cWhaddaya think about Omi-omi, Shou-kun?\u201d\nShouyou has found Twitter user Dumbass Hinata and now spends most of his time scrolling obsessively through the feed. Twitter user Dumbass Hinata tweets about Shouyou approximately thrice a day. Twitter user Dumbass Hinata does not seem to realize that making an account private is a thing that can be done.\n\u201cI dunno, he\u2019s pretty quiet, isn\u2019t he, \u2018Tsumu-san?\u201d Pretty quiet? Sakusa spends so much time insulting Atsumu verbally that he should start listing it as a hobby on the Black Jackals official website, along with wiping furniture down using antiseptic wipes. Shouyou laughs, and Atsumu realizes his thoughts had not remained in his head. \u201cOh, this one\u2026 look. \u2018Hinata used to be so scrawny and now he\u2019s just all muscle.\u2019 Is that a compliment?\u201d\nIt\u2019s an end-of-the-season party, which means they\u2019re allowed some alcohol. Atsumu sips his gin and tonic. Shouyou has a half-empty glass of whisky. It\u2019s spreading a wonderful mist of rose over his cheeks. Are those freckles? Atsumu cannot handle Shouyou.\n\u201cI think he\u2019s just statin\u2019 facts.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a \u2018he\u2019, Atsumu-san.\u201d\nActually, Atsumu  does  know, but he amends his statement with \u2018they\u2019 anyway, just for Shouyou. Shouyou reads through the profile some more. Twitter user Dumbass Hinata is astonished at Shouyou\u2019s growth as a volleyball player. Twitter user Dumbass Hinata is very impressed by the challenges presented by beach volleyball. Twitter user Dumbass Hinata wonders what Shouyou thinks about while he\u2019s in Brazil and if he ever misses home and the people there.\nSchweiden Adlers setter Dumbass Kageyama needs to man up and \u2018fess up before Atsumu actually recklessly kisses Shouyou and ruins everybody\u2019s lives\u2014chiefly Kageyama\u2019s. Maybe Oikawa Tooru\u2019s, which would be a sweet bonus. However, ruining Kageyama\u2019s life would ruin Shouyou\u2019s, which would ruin Atsumu\u2019s. Atsumu will not be kissing anyone recklessly until he\u2019s figured out the whole deal with Sakusa, anyway.\n\u201cSometimes I wonder what Sakusa-san was like in high school. I\u2019ve talked to Komori-san a few times and I guess he was always like this? Prickly and stuff. I think he\u2019s cool. He reminds me of Kageyama sometimes, the way he\u2019s super neat with his nails. Komori-san says he analyzes plays, but I\u2019ve never heard him do that. Although that would make him like Kageyama too!\u201d Shouyou does this thing where he will decide someone is cool and then praise the person by comparing them to Kageyama. Atsumu wonders how it\u2019s possible to be this dense. \u201cWhy the sudden interest in Sakusa-san, Atsumu-san?\u201d\n\u201cUh.\u201d Atsumu searches his brain for a believable excuse. \u2018Just scouting my enemies\u2019 seems demonstrably false in the volleyball sense, although in other ways Sakusa is, of course, Atsumu\u2019s enemy. \u2018I think I might want to fuck him, despite his personality\u2019 is too honest for their team dynamics to survive. So Atsumu settles on: \u201cTobio-kun owns the Dumbass Hinata Twitter account.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nAs intended, this wipes all curiosity about Atsumu\u2019s Sakusa-related question from Shouyou\u2019s mind. He has now ruined any chance he might have had with Hinata Shouyou, and for what? Present Atsumu is already disappointed with One-Second-Ago Atsumu and his big stupid mouth.\n\u201cYa heard me. I think you should call him out on it.\u201d\n\u201cBut the account says such nice things,\u201d Shouyou says in a hushed, awed voice. Atsumu thinks Shouyou is still beautiful but has obviously been driven insane by love.\n\u201cWell, you should confront him. He should say those things ta\u2019 yer face, Shou-kun.\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d The look on Shouyou\u2019s face is the one he gets just before he\u2019s about to spike a particularly wicked set. Those are the eyes of a demon. Oh, Atsumu wants to kiss him. Pity he\u2019s practically taken. \u201cRight! You\u2019re right, Atsumu-san. I\u2019m going to\u2026 call him now, and! Demand the truth.\u201d\nHe is dialling Kageyama with his phone number pad. He has Kageyama\u2019s number memorized. Ah, love. To have your number memorized by the most versatile and attractive player of your generation. To possess absolutely no people skills to speak of and still have the social butterfly of the volleyball world fall head over heels for you in high school. Some people really do have it all.\n\u201cImma leave ya to it and go dancin\u2019,\u201d he says, but Shouyou has stopped perceiving the rest of the world in general as he presses his phone close to his ear. Atsumu sighs, dejected. So that ship has sailed.\nHe grabs a huge bottle of water at the bar and downs it, then heads for the dance floor. Atsumu likes dancing while tipsy, mostly because it helps him sober up. Contrary to what most people may expect from him, Atsumu does not like being too drunk. There\u2019s too much loss of control. Too much unwarranted honesty\u2014and not of the fun, provocative kind. When he gets to a point where he knows the alcohol is affecting him, Atsumu heads for the dance floor and starts moving. Usually people would steal glances or even blatantly stare at him\u2014that, he actually likes.\nAtsumu lets the music carry his movements until he feels the beat of each song more than the thrum of the booze. It\u2019s good. Life\u2019s good. They\u2019ve handed the Adlers\u2019 asses to them on the biggest court in Miyagi and life\u2019s good. He turns. Sakusa is leaning on one of the tables at the edge of the dancefloor, Bokuto at his side. Atsumu stops turning. He walks that way, because he ain\u2019t no coward.\n\u201cSee somethin\u2019 ya like?\u201d\n\u201cSomethin\u2019,\u201d Sakusa drawls with exaggerated relish.\n\u00a0\u201cYA LIKE,\u201d Bokuto yells, completely losing the Kansai accent he probably means to imitate, before dissolving in a fit of full-body giggles.\nAtsumu hates it when Sakusa and Bokuto get along.\n\u201cY\u2019all Tokyo boys don\u2019t know how to do nothin\u2019 but ignore yer neighbors and hike up coffee prices,\u201d he tells them a-matter-of-factly.\n\u201cIgnoring your neighbors is a skill,\u201d Sakusa says, right as Bokuto bellows, \u201cCoffee is worth it!\u201d\nAtsumu cannot believe that these diametrically opposed personalities could team up to execute such a perfect two-pronged attack. Is this the power of the capital city? He is going to get nowhere on the does-he-want-to-fuck-Sakusa front at this rate. Fortunately (or unfortunately) for him Bokuto spots the love of his life, Akaashi Keiji, across the floor, and starts bouncing in his direction to dance with him, leaving Atsumu and Sakusa alone.\u00a0\nSakusa is wearing a black shirt with two of its buttons unfastened. This would be quite a conservative outfit for most people, but the way his spine curves is making it fit in a frankly obscene way. His collarbones peek out from under the fabric. Atsumu briefly entertains the thought of tracing them with his tongue. Mm.\n\u201cAre ya drunk, Omi-kun?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Sakusa raises a little flask. \u201cI brought my own drink, but it wasn\u2019t strong.\u201d\nTypical.\nHm. How can Atsumu approach the matter without having his pride and dignity shattered? How can Atsumu ask Sakusa, hey, when we were shooting that video with the horny tweets, were you kind of hitting on me? How can he do this without seeming like a complete idiot, is the thing.\n\u201cAre you going to ask me to have sex with you, Miya. Because if so you should probably do it soon. I plan to be asleep by\u2026\u201d Sakusa checks his watch. \u201cOne-thirty.\u201d\nAtsumu resists the urge to stick two fingers in his ears to check whether or not they\u2019re still there.\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\n\u201cDo you want to have sex with me or not?\u201d\nIncredibly, what comes out of Atsumu\u2019s mouth is this: \u201cDo I hafta shower first?\u201d\nSakusa closes his eyes like he\u2019s having a migraine and makes a dying noise, clenching his pale fists. He rolls his wrists in a way that would be painful for anyone else. Atsumu flinches. After a long, torturous second, Sakusa answers, \u201cYes.\u201d It sounds like it\u2019s being dragged out of him with hooks.\n\u201cYa know, Omi-omi, if you don\u2019t wanna, you don\u2019t have to offer,\u201d Atsumu tells him.\nSakusa just gives him a very long-suffering look he\u2019s not sure he deserves. But they do get out of there after that, so that\u2019s a win for Atsumu\u2019s research purposes. Sakusa insists on going to his room because he says he can\u2019t be sure Atsumu\u2019s room is hygienic enough. Atsumu says fuck you. Sakusa stares at him then informs him that hadn\u2019t been an insult.\nWhen Atsumu still wants to put his hands all over Sakusa after the latter has made them take separate hot showers, he considers the question of whether or not he finds Sakusa attractive resolved.\u00a0\n\u201cHey, can I have a request?\u201d\nSakusa quirks his brow at him.\n\u201cIf we\u2019re gonna do this, can ya call me Atsumu, during? It\u2019s gonna be weird if you call me Miya. I might remember Osamu, and then no one\u2019s gonna have fun.\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d A hand in his hair forces him to look up, pulling sharply down. With the voice he\u2019d used in the video shoot to throw Atsumu down a well of sexually charged confusion, Sakusa goes: \u201cAtsumu.\u201d\nEverything goes down very quickly after that. Sakusa rides him with one hand lightly gripping Atsumu\u2019s neck until Atsumu damn near forgets his name, so his request doesn\u2019t even matter anymore.\nAfter they\u2019re done, Sakusa gets up, goes to the bathroom, and Atsumu hears the sound of the shower starting up again. Fucking batshit. He pushes his face into the pillow and drifts off, thinking Sakusa will kick him out when he gets out of the shower anyway. Whatever. It\u2019s all out of his system now, so that\u2019s good.\nHe wakes up to unfamiliar beeping.\n\u201cNngh,\u201d he says, hand slapping around on the bedside table in an attempt to find the source of the offending noise. Smack smack smack. Where the fuck did he put his phone this time?\n\u201cQuit that.\u201d\nHis alarm is Sakusa\u2019s voice? That\u2019s new. Well, that\u2019s one way to get him out of bed\u2014wait.\nWait wait wait.\nAtsumu turns. He opens his eyes. Sakusa Kiyoomi is glaring at him like he put a dead body in his bed. Which he might as well have, seeing as he failed to leave last fucking night and his germs are probably all over the sheets now. If Sakusa kills him right now, is some deranged asshole on the internet going to make a thirst tweet about the murder? One wonders.\n\u201cShit, Omi.\u201d\n\u201cYou should go. So I can call housekeeping and have the sheets changed.\u201d\n\u201cRight, lemme just. Peek outside? If yer gonna get breakfast ya should wait a bit after I go so people don\u2019t get uh, suspicious.\u201d\nAtsumu pulls on his clothes from last night, then opens the door a crack. There is another door open in the hallway. It appears to be Shouyou\u2019s, because Shouyou is standing in the doorway. In front of him is Kageyama Tobio, holding a bouquet of sunflowers. Kageyama had known Shouyou would like sunflowers. Atsumu thinks he sees tears on Shouyou\u2019s cheeks.\nHe should just wait for them to go into Shouyou\u2019s room, but Shouyou is now doing a complicated balancing act with his right arm and the sunflowers so he can hold both of Kageyama\u2019s hands. They appear to be speaking. Then Atsumu\u2019s stomach growls. Sakusa hisses at him to hurry it up.\n\u201cShouyou-kun will see me,\u201d Atsumu hisses back.\nSakusa tosses him a bathrobe. \u201cWear this and pretend this is your room. He can\u2019t possibly remember all our room numbers.\u201d\nThis is actually not a bad plan. Plus, Shouyou has never been to Atsumu\u2019s room\u2014and he never will now, what a tragedy\u2014so he really probably doesn\u2019t know.\n\u201cCan do. Hey, uh? Omi-kun? Thanks for last night, yeah? It was fun.\u201d\n\u201cYou too.\u201d Atsumu glances back at Sakusa who is still in bed, the sheets spilling around his hips like in some kind of painting. The light comes in from the window behind him. It diffuses over a small constellation of hickeys Atsumu left just below his neck. \u201cThere will be no repeat performances.\u201d\nAtsumu nods, then goes outside and shuts the door behind him.\n\u201cWhoa, hey! Good morning, Tobio-kun! Finally you\u2019ve decided to get yer head out of yer ass!\u201d He walks past, then stops and backtracks to shake Kageyama\u2019s hand vigorously. \u201cCongratulations, Shou-kun. I\u2019m so happy for you. Please teach him how ta talk to people.\u201d\nShouyou says, \u201cOkay! Thanks Atsumu-san!\u201d\nKageyama, whose brain is late to the party, squawks out an outraged \u201cWhat?!\u201d as Atsumu makes his way to the elevators, humming. Ah, love.\u00a0\nShouyou\u2019s voice rings out again behind him. \u201cUh, Atsumu-san? Wasn\u2019t that Sakusa-san\u2019s\u2026 room?\u201d\nShit fucking cicada babies fuck.\n\u201cNope! My room! That\u2019s totally my room, Shou-kun, yer gettin\u2019 pollen in yer eyes! Oh, ya hear that? That\u2019s the sound of the breakfast omelettes callin\u2019 my name. Yoohoo, Atsumu! Yoo-hoo! Like that. Ya hear \u2018em? They can\u2019t wait to see me! So noisy, just like my fans. See ya around, Shouyou-kun, Tobio-kun!\u201d\nHe opens the door to the emergency stairs then bolts down eighteen floors.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere are repeat performances. There are repeat performances for a whole-ass year.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nAtsumu is going to be the reason they lose this game.\u00a0\nKita Shinsuke is getting married and Atsumu is going to be the reason the Black Jackals lose their last pre-season match. The perfectly-cut cream card arrived at Atsumu\u2019s apartment three days ago and Atsumu is tossing too low, too wide, too fast. Kita Shinsuke will be spending the rest of his life with someone and Atsumu fails to save a ball that should\u2019ve been his to touch. Suna sticks his tongue out from across the net, and Atsumu doesn\u2019t even insult him back.\nAfterwards, Shouyou comes to him and asks him what is wrong. Bokuto comes to ask him what is wrong. Meian, the responsible captain, asks him what is wrong.\u00a0\nAtsumu once read a fun fact about giraffes\u2014about how, when they\u2019re old and sick, they sink down into holes in the ground and wait to die as the herd moves on. It had been his favorite fun fact for a week in seventh grade before Osamu told him he was being creepy. As Shouyou is telling him that it\u2019s okay, next time will be better, Atsumu wishes the herd would move the fuck on and let him wait for the sweet release of death. It\u2019s not like he doesn\u2019t know everybody has off days, or that they\u2019ve still got two weeks to the Division 1 V. League games. Bokuto needs to stop shouting shit that isn\u2019t news already.\n\u201cMiya.\u201d That\u2019s Sakusa, standing in front of Atsumu on the bench. He\u2019s already wearing his mask again. \u201cWhat was that? What kind of sets were you making, back there? The last one I hit was completely off. If I hadn\u2019t modified the trajectory that would\u2019ve been like snatching candy from a baby for Komori. Next time, if you\u2019re going to toss so weakly, do it higher so I have more potential energy to work with.\u201d\nAtsumu looks up.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be like that, Sakusa-san. He\u2019ll get it next time.\u201d\n\u201cNo, Shouyou-kun, it\u2019s fine.\u201d One of the herd members stayed behind to kick him because he isn\u2019t actually old and dying. All he has to do is get up and walk out of the hole. \u201cGot it, Omi-kun.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d Sakusa nods and leaves them.\nWhen Atsumu\u2019s changing in the locker room, thinking of the hand-lettered invitation he\u2019d read out loud to Osamu, Sakusa approaches him and tells him to come over later. Atsumu looks at him, surprised.\nSakusa makes an irritated \u2018tsk\u2019 sound behind his mask. \u201cI hope just because you\u2019ve forgotten how to play volleyball, you haven\u2019t also forgotten how to use your\u2014\u201c\n\u201cAlright, Omi-kun, alright! Broadcast it ta everyone on the team, will ya,\u201d Atsumu hisses at him under his breath.\n\u201cHmph.\u201d Sakusa leaves, which Atsumu appreciates in more than one way. Kita Shinsuke may be getting married, but Sakusa Kiyoomi still has a nice ass on very long legs.\nWhen Atsumu arrives at Sakusa\u2019s house that night, he\u2019s wearing a fresh change of clothes. He\u2019s just sent an e-mail to Kita saying that he\u2019s extremely sorry, but he won\u2019t be able to make it to the wedding on account of urgent matters that have to be taken care of in Tokyo. \u2018Urgent matters\u2019 is, of course, slang for three one-litre tubs of ice cream and a Blu-Ray DVD of Notting Hill.\n\u201cWhat happened today, against Raijin? That isn\u2019t how you play.\u201d\n\u201cHello to you too, Omi-omi,\u201d Atsumu grouses as he puts on Sakusa\u2019s home slippers, then pulls out his bottle of sanitizer from his pocket to clean his hands. \u201cYou don\u2019t wanna know. It\u2019s stupid. Also, ya won\u2019t be able to comfort me for  shit. \u201d\nSakusa rolls his eyes.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to  comfort you, if that\u2019s what you thought. To be honest I have no idea what would make you think something like that. I need to know what that was so I can anticipate it if it happens during the championship games.\u201d\nAtsumu sighs, taking a seat at the small table in Sakusa\u2019s living room. Logical. And it\u2019s starting to look like they\u2019re not going to get naked unless he spits it out, so, to avoid getting blue-balled by Kita\u2019s freakishly lovely, intricately inked wedding invitation, Atsumu does. \u201cSomeone I had a big crush on in high school is gettin\u2019 hitched. That\u2019s it. Don\u2019t even have feelings for him anymore. S\u2019just, I remember again that I\u2019m exactly the kinda guy he\u2019d never fall for, and he\u2019s the nicest man in the world, so if he can\u2019t want me, who can?\u201d\n\u201cSelf-pity is exceedingly unattractive on you, Miya. I want you.\u201d Yep, Atsumu thinks. Sakusa wants him the way a small dog wants the leg it\u2019s humping. Sakusa gestures at the space in front of him minutely. \u201cHence, this. Hence inviting you over.\u201d\nAtsumu laughs, although it doesn\u2019t really feel like a laugh.\u00a0\n\u201cNot like  that, Omi-omi. If I meant it like that, yer not the only one, trust me.\u201d\nSakusa shrugs, also minutely. \u201cThen I can\u2019t help you with that. How many people have you been in love with?\u201d\n\u201cWe playin\u2019 twenty questions, now?\u201d\n\u201cI need to know if anyone else\u2019s wedding is going to ruin the team\u2019s performance over the course of this season,\u201d Sakusa says flatly. \u201cOr the next. Or whatever seasons we have while people are still at the age when they marry instead of having illicit affairs.\u201d\n\u201cNope, just Kita-san. Only loved once.\u201d\n\u201cGood. Now take off your clothes.\u201d\nAtsumu lifts the chair a little and turns it so his whole body is facing Sakusa\u2019s. He showered already, even, which is really quite nice of him, ain\u2019t it? Atsumu is the nicest. He gestures at his body. \u201cYou don\u2019t wanna do it? I just changed before I came here. These are freshly laundered and everythin\u2019.\u201d\nFor a moment Sakusa looks at him like he  is  the dumpster he\u2019s been told to take a bath in, but he walks over and deftly starts unbuttoning Atsumu\u2019s shirt anyway. Meticulous. Sakusa\u2019s hands are quick with buttons. Atsumu picked out a button-down because he likes watching Sakusa open it.\n\u201cIf I\u2019d told ya there were others aside from Kita, what wouldja do? Kill them so I won\u2019t have to know when they get married?\u201d Atsumu teases.\n\u201cThat\u2019s entirely too much effort.\u201d Sakusa finishes unbuttoning the shirt and pushes it off fluidly from Atsumu\u2019s shoulders. It drops to the floor with a sigh. Sakusa inspects Atsumu\u2019s chest like a coroner about to start his autopsy. \u201cIt would be much more efficient to just kill you and ask Oikawa Tooru to join the Black Jackals by offering him the chance to defeat Kageyama with the help of his own significant other.\u201d\n\u201cHa! Yer funny, Omi.\u201d\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t a joke.\u201d\nSakusa crooks a finger under Atsumu\u2019s chin and nudges upwards. Atsumu stands, letting the motion of Sakusa\u2019s hand guide him as it ascends. Eyes blacker than black. Two perfectly round dots on his forehead. All this, stark, against pale skin.\n\u201cOmi-kun,\u201d Atsumu says.\n\u201cYes?\u201d\nAtsumu thinks about what he\u2019s going to say. He\u2019s not in love with Sakusa, and Sakusa\u2019s not in love with him, and when they have sex it can be whatever they want it to be. It can be whatever Atsumu wants it to be.\n\u201cI want it to hurt, tonight.\u201d\nSakusa presses his thumb down on Atsumu\u2019s bottom lip. He cocks his head ever so slightly to the left.\n\u201cIn what way?\u201d\nAtsumu shrugs.\n\u201cYou\u2019re leaving it in my hands?\u201d Atsumu nods. \u201cThree-color code?\u201d Atsumu nods again. Sakusa pauses, takes his hand away from Atsumu\u2019s face. He glances downward and to the left, eyebrows a little closer together in thought. \u201cIf you want me to stop, say \u2018onigiri\u2019.\u201d\nAtsumu barks out a laugh at that. \u201cDon\u2019t go growin\u2019 a sense of humor on me now, Omi-omi.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d never want you to think such a thing.\u201d\nA hand in his hair. A sharp tug downwards. Sakusa kisses to bruise.\nGreen, when Sakusa asks. Green, when Sakusa asks again. Green, again and again. Sakusa asks. Atsumu answers.\nAfterwards, Sakusa actually bullies him into the shower. Then, clean as a whistle and higher than its tone on the afterglow, Atsumu drifts off in Sakusa\u2019s obnoxiously large guest room while Sakusa goes to brew himself chamomile tea or something in the kitchen. He wakes up to a deluge of light coming in through the window, warming his skin and forcing him to squint when he opens his eyes.\nThere\u2019s a change of clothes on the bedside table. Atsumu puts it on and goes to the living room, where Sakusa is using a neon green cloth to wipe his mahogany coffee table. Sakusa\u2019s house is weirdly warm, despite its inhabitant. Lots of fragrant wood. Plush carpets the color of plums. Patterned cream curtains. Atsumu had thought, before he first came here, that Sakusa would be one of those people who lived in a block of concrete with white furniture that looks like it\u2019s been 3D-printed, the only color around the faint blue-green of thick glass. The whole place always smells like something jarringly sterile, at odds with the plush feeling of the house.\n\u201cYa have a favorite brand of disinfectant, Omi-omi?\u201d\nSakusa doesn\u2019t look up. He\u2019s working on one of the table legs. \u201cYes. I order it in bulk.\u201d\n\u201cHuh.\u201d\n\u201cYou can catch the nine-thirty train if you leave in seven minutes.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, no breakfast?\u201d Atsumu asks.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a konbini at the metro station.\u201d\nAtsumu chuckles to himself and goes to put his shoes on.\n\u201cMiya,\u201d Sakusa calls out. Atsumu pauses, turns a little. Sakusa is folding the green cloth with pinched fingers. He hasn\u2019t put his mask on because he doesn\u2019t have to go outside yet. \u201cWe have practice in three days and the first V. League game in ten. Get it together before then.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah. You don\u2019t hafta tell me twice.\u201d He walks towards the front door. Then he stops, turns one last time. \u201cOh, and Omi-kun? Thanks again.\u201d\nSakusa inclines his head, just barely.\nThe day that greets him outside is a sunny one. Atsumu pulls out his phone and sends an e-mail to Kita Shinsuke, telling him his calendar has cleared up and he\u2019ll be attending the wedding to wish him well. Just for kicks, Atsumu will get himself a maroon suit. He has brogues that fit him better than his father\u2019s. And, he thinks as he runs his hand through it, he\u2019s got the poised-but-rakish hairstyle down after years of experimentation. He winks at a passing woman, who immediately starts walking faster.\nAtsumu orders a bouquet of fifty ruby red roses.\nHe has it delivered to Aran.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhaaat the hell is this,\u201d says Aran as he flips his camera phone to shoot the scarlet monstrosity the next day. Suna\u2019s laughter is tinny through the speaker. \u201cMy teammates think I\u2019ve got a secret girlfriend stashed somewhere. Take responsibility, Atsumu. You gotta find me a real girlfriend now.\u201d\nAtsumu raises his two hands. \u201cWho, me? C\u2019mon, Aran-kun, surely that\u2019s a piece a\u2019 cake fer you! With your American charm and everything\u2014hey, that\u2019s a song, right? American Charm.  Take me to New York, bla bla bla bloo, L.A.!  Back me up here, \u2018Samu.\u201d\n\u201cThe title\u2019s American  Boy, ya numbskull,\u201d Osamu supplies, to further peals of tinny laughter from Suna. Gin joins in.\n\u201cShaddup, it\u2019s not like I speak English or anything.\u201d\n\u201cYa  barely  speak Japanese,\u201d Osamu mutters. On-screen, Aran guffaws. Now that they\u2019re all far apart the team seems to really enjoy calling Atsumu and Osamu just to laugh at everything they say. Atsumu figures this is something they\u2019ve done since high school, but somehow it\u2019s so much more obvious over video.\n\u201cBut for real, Atsumu.\u201d Aran appears to have put his phone on some surface. \u201cWhat  is  this? Are ya about to confess yer love, like when Kita graduated? I\u2019m tellin\u2019 ya, I\u2019m single but I ain\u2019t desperate.\u201d\nOsamu answers for him, \u201c\u2018Tsumu\u2019s trying to do the throwback thing, but he can\u2019t send \u2018em to Kita, \u2018cause that would be weird. And he can\u2019t send \u2018em to Sakusa, \u2018cause that would be weirder. So he\u2019s sendin\u2019 \u2018em to you.\u201d\n\u201cAnd ya think  this  ain\u2019t weird?\u201d Aran asks, grimacing. At the same time, Suna perks up, asking, \u201cSakusa?\u201d\nOf course Suna has to focus on the worst part.\n\u201c\u2018Tsumu was havin\u2019 a mental breakdown after Kita-san sent the invitation, until Sakusa fucked it out of him. Or fucked him out of it. Whichever ya like,\u201d Osamu elaborates. Atsumu smacks him.\n\u201cAtsumu, ya ho,\u201d Gin says.\n\u201cOi, you shut yer mouth!\u201d\n\u201cHe kinda looks like Suna, don\u2019t he, that Sakusa? Did ya ever have a thing for Suna, Atsumu?\u201d Aran asks, plucking one of the roses out of the bouquet.\n\u201cEw,\u201d Suna and Atsumu say at the same time. Atsumu squints at him, outraged. \u201cHey, what\u2019re ya \u2018ew\u2019-in\u2019 for? Besides, Suna and Omi-kun don\u2019t look like each other at all.\u201d\n\u201cOmi-kun,\u201d Suna repeats.\n\u201cI give everyone in the team nicknames, whattabout it,\u201d Atsumu says. \u201cThere\u2019s Bokkun, and Shou-kun, and\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOkay, Atsumu, no need to get defensive,\u201d Aran says, laughing. \u201cAnyway, I really can\u2019t tell you enough how much I don\u2019t wanna know anything else about Atsumu\u2019s sex life or love life or whatever. Back to the real matter at hand, huh? What\u2019re you guys gettin\u2019 Kita, as a wedding gift?\u201d\nThey discuss. Atsumu lets Osamu speak for them as a unit.\nLove life? What the hell would that be like, then, dating Sakusa Kiyoomi? There\u2019s a konbini at the metro station, and you can catch the nine-thirty train. You can kiss any dream of having breakfast in bed goodbye, not just because Sakusa would never cook it, but because he\u2019d kill you for spilling just one crumb on the sheets. He\u2019d sooner suffocate you with a cloth soaked in his favorite disinfectant.\nYou have an off day. You get stuck on the ghost of a high school memory. He doesn\u2019t waste any time babying you. He gives you what you need when you ask for it.\nWell, shit. Atsumu is more fucked than a bunny rabbit in a warren.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLife continues normally after Atsumu figures out he\u2019s in love with the man he\u2019s been sleeping with for a year, which is awesome. He\u2019s professional about it. He doesn\u2019t bring it into their next encounter. He doesn\u2019t leave lingering touches on said man\u2019s arm. He leaves as requested. He doesn\u2019t get drunk and text him maudlin messages at weird hours in the morning.\nThing is, Atsumu is an egotistical bastard and proud of it. But there\u2019s a reason he gets called the setter who\u2019s the most generous to his spikers, and that\u2019s because Atsumu saves his courtesy for when it counts, such as when he doesn\u2019t bring feelings into an arrangement with a man who would sooner eat a sock than date him. (Considering who the man in question is, Atsumu thinks he\u2019s bringing the proper amount of weight into his metaphor.)\nAnd if he starts calling that man Kiyoomi in his head, ain\u2019t no one around to judge him for it.\nExcept Osamu, who notices the  exact moment Atsumu makes up his mind to do so as Atsumu is helping himself to leftover omurice in the kitchen one day, washing his hands for twenty seconds beforehand. Osamu shoots him a look as dirty as sewer water.\n\u201cDon\u2019t. Say. A. Word.\u201d\nOsamu shrugs at him. Atsumu flips him the bird with his freshly-washed hand. Then Osamu helps him pick out an outfit for the dinner party Shouyou and Tobio has invited them to. Then Atsumu insults the outfit Osamu chooses for himself, and Osamu shoves him into a doorknob with enough precision to hit Atsumu\u2019s solar plexus, knocking the wind out of him.\nThey\u2019re not even late to the homey event space Shouyou and Tobio had rented for the get-together. Shouyou calls it their last chance to all be friends before they start watching each other in the brackets and making threats of violence over the net. Kiyoomi is already there in a dark green turtleneck that Atsumu doesn\u2019t even want to strip him of\u2014he looks that good. Osamu shoots him another dirty look.\nAtsumu hates being a twin. His first feast should have been Osamu, in the womb, wrapped in the umbilical cord instead of nori. Literal onigiri Miya.\nIt\u2019s a little packed; Shouyou seems to have made it his personal ambition to get all the Division 1 players who had played competitively in high school into one dinner party. Atsumu knows it\u2019s all Shouyou, because Tobio could never. The Schweiden Adlers\u2019 prodigy setter has all the social instincts of an ostracized rock. (But then again, looking at Ushijima and Hoshiumi, this seems to be a team attribute for all players under twenty-five.)\nIt\u2019s bright. It\u2019s warm. Shouyou looks even more angelic, laughing on Tobio\u2019s arm, evidently full of joy. Since that day at the hotel with the sunflowers, every time Atsumu sees Tobio with Shouyou, he looks like someone just handed him the actual sun after he\u2019s been locked in a basement for years. Ah, love.\nSpeaking of. Kiyoomi\u2019s on the balcony, awkwardly avoiding any of its actual architectural features. Except the floor, which he must touch by virtue of having feet. He is once again drinking from his own flask. Atsumu goes to bother him, because what else is he going to do? Make conversation with Ushijima Wakatoshi? The man\u2019s perfectly nice and all, but Atsumu would rather eat a sock.\nKiyoomi hasn\u2019t spoken much today. In general, he tends to resort to his annoying stares anyway.\n\u201cA lil\u2019 quiet, ain\u2019t you, around Shou-kun and the others?\u201d Atsumu asks as he closes the balcony doors behind him.\n\u201cIf I talk too much around them, I\u2019ll offend them.\u201d\n\u201cHuh. I always know I offend people. And I keep talkin\u2019 anyway. Works out pretty well.\u201d\n\u201cLucky you.\u201d\nThe moment sits between them. Kiyoomi has implemented a strict no-sex policy starting three days from before each League match, so Atsumu won\u2019t be going home with him tonight. But he can still look at the way the soft lamplight falls on his face. Just look. That\u2019s not crossing any boundaries, is it?\n\u201cYer chatty enough with me, though,\u201d Atsumu says as casually as he can, full of dangerous hope.\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like you\u2019ll be offended by anything I say.\u201d Kiyoomi takes out his wipes and cleans the balcony railing before leaning on it. \u201cWe\u2019re the same.\u201d\n\u201cWe are?\u201d\nKiyoomi shrugs. \u201cI know you can be thick, but I should hope you\u2019re not  that  thick.\u201d\n\u201cHa ha, ya know what else is thick.\u201d Atsumu goes for the low-hanging fruit. Kiyoomi raises one perfect eyebrow. Oh, fuck, he\u2019s calling Kiyoomi\u2019s  eyebrows perfect now. He really is in too deep. Ha, ha. Too deep. Kiyoomi squints at him like he knows Atsumu just made a lame joke in his head.\u00a0\nMan, fuck this guy. Atsumu has enough snarky mind-readers in his life. \u201cAaa-nyway, guess yer right, Omi-omi. We\u2019re real nasty, aren\u2019t we?\u201d\n\u201cIf that\u2019s what other people want to call it.\u201d\n\u201cHey, nasty or not nasty\u2014they like us, ya know. The others.\u201d\nKiyoomi smiles just a teensy tiny bit as they watch Bokuto attempt to lift Shouyou up, to Tobio\u2019s apparent consternation. Hoshiumi\u2019s voice carries his wish to attempt lifting Hinata Shouyou as well! Because he can do it better than Bokuto! Ushijima has taken the spritzing bottle from the windowsill and is now watering the plants. Goshiki is helping him by holding the plants up so they\u2019re closer to the water sprays, and Komori appears to be cheering them on.\n\u201cFor some reason. Lucky us,\u201d Kiyoomi murmurs. For once he doesn\u2019t sound facetious about his positive emotions.\n\u201cKiyoomi,\u201d Atsumu says, about to break his perfect record of professionalism.\nExcept Shouyou has evaded Hoshiumi\u2019s clutches, opening the balcony doors. He leans forward, eyes bright and twinkling with a hand curved next to his mouth. Atsumu thanks Kita\u2019s gods for the intervention. It is rare that he\u2019s not allowed to make a fool of himself, but evidently it happens sometimes.\n\u201cI need you guys to get back inside,\u201d Shouyou stage whispers at them. \u201cI\u2019m going to propose! To Tobio!\u201d\n\u201cOh, I thought you were going to propose to Hoshiumi,\u201d Kiyoomi deadpans.\n\u201cShhh, Omi-omi, stop being so negative.\u201d\nShouyou grins terrifyingly at them.\n\u201cYou can be snide about it later, Sakusa-san!  Now get back inside!\u201d\nThey obey. They have never ever incurred Shouyou\u2019s wrath, but Atsumu hears it\u2019s a situation you don\u2019t want to be in. He spies Akaashi guide Tobio to the balcony, where Shouyou is waiting. Tobio just goes.\u00a0\nWhen he comes back inside, he\u2019s a bucket of tears, although his expression gives nothing else away. Slowly, like it\u2019s a museum display rotating into view, he raises a hand, where a simple silver band encircles his ring finger. Shouyou enters behind him, also crying. The room erupts in cheers. Hoshiumi leaps, sticks the landing on the coffee table, and howls like he\u2019s a shipwreck survivor trying to attract the attention of a passing plane. Atsumu turns to Kiyoomi, who is looking at Shouyou kiss Tobio. He\u2019s smiling, a small and wistful thing Atsumu would have never thought him capable of just a year ago. Atsumu feels like his heart is breaking all over again. But this time it feels good.\nWith that, Shouyou and his lucky paramour decide to engage in that interesting pastime of the young, financially confident, and beautiful: marriage. It is a wonderful occasion that takes place a week before the finals, six months since Shouyou proposed to Tobio on the balcony. Bokuto cries all over Akaashi\u2019s shirt. Then, when Akaashi gets up to get them both food, Bokuto cries all over Atsumu\u2019s shirt, snot and all. Afterwards Kiyoomi refuses to unbutton it by himself\u2014Atsumu has Bokuto to thank for the first time he ever gives a striptease. Kiyoomi still sleeps with him though, so Atsumu will let it slide. He\u2019s always happy to learn new things.\nBy uniting in holy matrimony, Shouyou and his now-husband have also decided to engage in their shared, mutually-cherished, time-honored pastime. It is the thing that had really brought them together\u2014wreaking havoc on the unsuspecting world of volleyball.\n\u201cNow, that was an incredibly clean dig by Inunaki, who passes it  beau-tifully  to Miya! Miya sets\u2014would you look at that form, Hirashi! And Hinata\u2014I mean Kageyama\u2014spikes it! Score! That\u2019s another one for the Black Jackals, unbelievable!\u201d\n\u201cStill tripping up on that, aren\u2019t you, Sato.\u201d\n\u201cRight you are, Hirashi. Very recent development. Very joyful news. Oh, but the Adlers aren\u2019t about to lie down and take it just yet! Absolutely  lethal  serve from Ushijima\u2014Kageyama receives it like it\u2019s nothing! Up in the air it goes\u2026 Miya. Sakusa. Oh! Thwarted by Hoshiumi. Kageyama\u2026 pulls off an  incredibly  nasty dump! WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT!\u201d\n\u201cI THINK YOU MEAN HINATA,\u201d the speakers go.\n\u201cYES, HINATA. Thank you, Hirashi. Well, the husband that\u2019s in the Adlers.\u201d\n\u201cThe setter husband, yes. That would be Hinata Tobio, now, who  just  scored for the Schweiden Adlers.\u201d\n\u201cThis newlywed face-off comes right at the heels of his wedding to the Black Jackals wing spiker, who legally changed  his  name to Kageyama Shouyou! Wonder what the atmosphere at the dining table is going to be like later, after one of them inevitably loses this match?\u201d\n\u201cHoho, good thing we won\u2019t be around to find out, Sato.\u201d\n\u201cMiya and Kageyama waste no time, taking their point back. And now\u2026 a service ace, from Bokuto! The Jackals are on fire today, and they\u2019re now at set point  again!\u201d\nAtsumu had woken up in a good mood today. He had woken up knowing they would be facing off against the Adlers, and he had woken up knowing they were going to win. Hoshiumi serves, and Shouyou, ever reliable, receives it, sending it clear into the air. The rally is long. Atsumu ends up blocking a spike from Romero that nearly tears his fingers off.\n\u201cOne touch!\u201d he and Meian yell at the same time, and the ball is bouncing, beautifully, into Inunaki\u2019s waiting arms. There it is. They\u2019re going to fucking win this. The blood in his veins is singing. Crescendo, crescendo, as the Black Jackals all rise to the occasion. Bokuto soars. Meian leaps. Thomas runs up to take off. Kiyoomi has his eyes trained on the ball. Shouyou is a blur across the court, a demon out of hell.\u00a0\nAtsumu spots the second the Adlers mark him\u2014he glances once in the direction of his beautiful redheaded spiker, the apple of everyone\u2019s eye\u2014and tosses it at the waiting hand of Kiyoomi. Bam. The sound of it rattles in Atsumu\u2019s skull. For a moment, Kiyoomi is suspended in the air, the ceiling lights fanning out bright beams around him, dark hair floating in gleaming spirals around his face as he descends back to Earth. The ball\u2019s wicked spin takes it on a curved path to the spot right between Heiwajima\u2019s fingers and the out line.\nThe roaring that explodes from the stands obliterates Atsumu\u2019s eardrums, even as he joins in. The entire team floods in to huddle in a circle, each man one meter away from Kiyoomi, facing him. They cheer like a rotating donut with Kiyoomi in the middle. He doesn\u2019t do team huddles, not even after a match point like that.\nSakusa Kiyoomi just crowned the MSBY Black Jackals Champions of V. League Division 1.\nAnd Atsumu\u2019s the lucky sonuvabitch who gets to suck his dick to celebrate it.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAtsumu has never made space for another person in his life. This is true even for Osamu, who had to grow up thick-skinned and strong-fisted to resist Atsumu\u2019s constant attempts to encroach on his territory, physical or otherwise. (The threat of getting devoured in the womb might have been a real one.) His silent glares had matched Atsumu\u2019s constant chatter. This is true even for the Inarizaki Volleyball Team, which grew around Atsumu, taking the shape of his sets, his serves.\u00a0\nThis is true even for Kita Shinsuke, whom Atsumu had claimed to love. Atsumu had wanted Kita to grow around him, like everyone else. Like vines, winding around a castle, blooming in the spring\u2014still following the shapes of the turrets and the gates. Why had he loved Kita, indeed. Why had he thought Kita would like roses?\nAtsumu takes his bottle of sanitizer and cleans his hands. They\u2019re done with their celebration dinner, and Atsumu is very deliberately not drinking anything during the afterparty. Kiyoomi is allowing Bokuto to balance a shot glass on his head, although he looks like he\u2019s being threatened to do so at gunpoint.\nHe catches Atsumu\u2019s eye. With an economic motion of his head, he topples the shot glass off his hair, forcing Inunaki to dive to receive it in his palms. He makes his way to Atsumu, eyelids half-lowered, and Atsumu prepares all his reserves of mental fortitude. Admittedly it doesn\u2019t amount to much, but.\n\u201cWell?\u201d\n\u201cCome over to my flat, tomorrow?\u201d\nHe looks unimpressed. He was probably expecting Atsumu to just get on his knees right here and\u2014oops. New fantasy alert. So it\u2019s not like Atsumu doesn\u2019t want to, and it\u2019s not like he doesn\u2019t get how annoying it feels to expect something like that and meet a roadblock.\n\u201cTomorrow?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\"Your  flat?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Are ya gonna ask about the \u2018come over\u2019 part now too, or what?\u201d\n\u201cWell, since you so generously provided me with the opening\u2014\u201c\n\u201cLook, Omi-omi, would you just. Please?\u201d Atsumu gives him his best puppy dog eyes. Osamu has told him it makes him look like he ingested rat poison and needs to be put down, but as everyone knows Osamu is a filthy liar. \u201cIt\u2019s important.\u201d\n\u201cWhy.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll find out tomorrow,\u201d Atsumu says in what he hopes is an enticing tone.\n\u201cWhy not tonight, at mine.\u201d\n\u201cBecause ya have to rest! After a game like that. I\u2019m beat, aren\u2019t you beat? You need yer beauty sleep. Need ta be well-rested for\u2026 other activities.\u201d\nKiyoomi squints at him.\n\u201cWhy  does this matter so much to you, Miya.\u201d\n\u201cIt just does! You\u2019ll find out why, would ya just  trust me?\u201d\nKiyoomi\u2019s face relaxes into its regular neutral-but-judgmental expression. \u201cFine,\u201d he says, in a tone that says if Atsumu disappoints him again, he will find his lungs full of disinfectant soon enough. Atsumu gulps as Kiyoomi turns to join Bokuto and Thomas, who are now doing a very soulful but off-key rendition of We Are the Champions.\nKiyoomi doesn\u2019t sing. Atsumu does, later, as they all walk to the station, his head tucked between Meian\u2018s and Shouyou\u2019s as they disturb the peace by belting out Eye of the Tiger, guitar riffs and all. Somebody shushes them from a second floor balcony. Atsumu dodges an empty milk carton thrown at him from a window. He makes his way home. He goes to bed. He has a whole day ahead of him tomorrow.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKiyoomi arrives at Atsumu\u2019s building the next day at five p.m. sharp. He buzzes the intercom, and Atsumu opens the door and activates the lift access for him. When the doorbell echoes throughout the house, Atsumu has folded the bathrobe he bought in a perfect flat square. He has sexiled Osamu. The entire flat smells like a hospital ward.\nIt is the moment of truth.\nAtsumu goes to the door and opens it. At first, nothing happens when Kiyoomi makes his way inside. He takes in the place. He stares at each corner for a few seconds. Maybe he\u2019s marking potential exits. It\u2019s awkward, so Atsumu opens his big dumb mouth and goes, \u201cYa never told me yer favorite brand of disinfectant, and I couldn\u2019t find it on my own, so I looked up what disinfectant had good reviews on all websites. I bought this one. It smells kinda like the ER, right? Also I got you a new bathrobe \u2018cause I know ya don\u2019t wanna wear anything of mine. Checked the thread count and everythin\u2019, so maybe it\u2019s nice, I dunno, I haven\u2019t tried it on.\u201d\nFinally, Kiyoomi turns. His eyes are wide as saucers, displaying the full devastating power of their inky depths. He looks at Atsumu like it\u2019s the first time he\u2019s ever seen him, except this time Atsumu might not have managed to make the atrocious first impression he had actually made back then, when he\u2019d pulled at Kiyoomi\u2019s mask so that it snapped back against his face.\n\u201cAtsumu,\u201d Sakusa Kiyoomi\u2014clean freak, Black Jackals spiker, and the thorn in Atsumu\u2019s wretched heart\u2014says, sounding like he\u2019s being strangled.\nDamage control. Atsumu can do damage control.\n\u201cLook, I know I made it weird, if you never wanna have sex with me again, that\u2019s okay, I won\u2019t be off\u2014\u201c\nHe doesn\u2019t get to finish the sentence.\nHe doesn\u2019t make any coherent sentences for a long, long time.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nbettermiya Breakfast of champions.\n9 mins ago\n\n[A picture of Kiyoomi on the couch by Atsumu\u2019s window, holding a bowl. He wears a white bathrobe that falls open ever so slightly. Clearly he is wearing nothing under that and there is a line of purple snaking its way up the side of his throat. His face is turned towards the view outside, so the morning light traces his profile with a glowing white line.]\n\n\u00a0\nbokuto_official ATSUMU!!!!!!! MY MAN!!!!!!!!!!!!! WELCOME TO THE HEAVENLY GATES OF ROMANCE!!!!!!!!!\nkitashinsuke01 Congratulations, Atsumu. Wishing you both all the best.\nsuna_rintarou oh no youre gonna be so gross from now on\nojiroaran @suna_rintarou Right?

Apparently, this stuff is excellent off-season publicity. This time Atsumu is ready. This time, to Osamu\u2019s chagrin, Atsumu is hyped.\nWhen the bucket is passed to them, Atsumu and Kiyoomi both race to reach into it. They pull one slip of paper out each.\nAh. The gods have decided to smile at Atsumu. At long last. They\u2019re not Kita\u2019s gods anymore, he thinks.\n\u201cDo you think Sakusa would mind if I borrowed Miya for a day so he can raw me until I die? Just putting it out there.\u201d Kiyoomi speaks up first, then flicks the piece of paper out of the frame. \u201cYes, I\u2019d mind. Who do you think you are. Don't put these things out there. Keep them to your nasty selves.\u201d\nAtsumu clears his throat, stretching the paper in his hand out exaggeratedly like he\u2019s about to read out a scroll in some Victorian king's court. \u201cSakusa Kiyoomi is an actual Greek god put on this Earth and Miya Atsumu doesn\u2019t deserve such beauty on account of his shit personality. In this essay I will.\u201d Atsumu checks the back of the paper. It\u2019s blank. \u201cIn this essay what? Ya will what? Ha, can\u2019t even finish an essay. That\u2019s why I deserve Omi-omi and ya don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no continuation. It\u2019s a meme,\u201d the cameraman says.\n\u201cWell it\u2019s a stupid meme and yer stupid \u2018cause you wrote it,\u201d Atsumu retorts wittily\u2014to some random person on the internet that he\u2019ll never meet\u2014as he rips up the tweet in his hands.\n\u201cWhat is  wrong  with people,\u201d Atsumu and Kiyoomi say at the same time.\nThey look at each other. Atsumu grins. Kiyoomi\u2019s mouth twitches. Bokuto and Shouyou erupt into thunderous applause and actual literal hooting sounds.\nAh, love.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0"
