    "text": "Bruce wakes up not to the sound of his alarm, but to somebody poking his thigh repeatedly with a sharp blade. It\u2019s not forceful enough to actually injure, but it hurts, though not as much as his chest. Why does his chest hurt?\n\u201cIs he awake?\u201d\nI\u2019m awake, Bruce wants to say, but nothing comes out of his mouth.\n\u201cI think he\u2019s still asleep.\u201d That\u2019s a different voice, also masculine, deeper and significantly older than the first. \u201cStop bothering him, Damian.\u201d\n\u201cIf Father wanted me to stop bothering him, he can tell me himself.\u201d \nFather?\n\u201cAlright,\u201d somebody says, and, oh, that\u2019s a third voice, \u201cI\u2019m out of here. Don\u2019t call me again unless he's literally dying.\u201d\n\u201cHe was,\u201d says the first voice, \u201cliterally dying, Jason. It\u2019s only thanks to Tim that he survived.\u201d\n\u201cAnyone can jump in front of a bullet,\u201d says the kid who\u2019s called Damian. He sounds disdainful. \u201cI would jump in front of many bullets for Father.\u201d\n\u201cThis,\u201d Jason says, \u201cis exactly why I don\u2019t answer Bruce\u2019s calls, in case you were wondering.\u201d\n\u201cJason,\u201d the first person says, sounding weary, \u201cyou don\u2019t answer Bruce\u2019s calls because you don\u2019t want him to lecture you on what body parts are and are not acceptable to leave in front of a police station.\u201d \n\u201cWhich body parts are acceptable?\u201d\n\u201cNone of them,\u201d the first person says at the same time that Damian says, \u201cIt depends.\u201d\nDepends on what, Bruce wants to ask, but he\u2019s already falling back asleep, and besides, there\u2019s a much more important question on the tip of his tongue. \nWhatever happened to him, and whatever caused this apparent amnesia he is experiencing \u2013 how many kids did he forget having?\n*\nThe next time he wakes up, he is alone. The room no longer smells like disinfectant and death, so it\u2019s safe to say that he left the hospital, and indeed, when he opens his eyes he finds that he is in his bedroom at the manor. There\u2019s something wrong with it, though. The furniture is all the same, but the walls are bare, and so is the night stand next to his bed. Was the earlier conversation a fever dream? A hallucination? It must have been, because surely, if he really does have a gaggle of children he cannot remember, he would have put up pictures of them. \nBruce reaches for his phone, types in the passcode \u2013 and frowns. \nWrong passcode. \nAmnesia, he thinks again, and definitely affecting several years, if not decades, of his life. That\u2019s the only explanation for this newfound family, and it would also explain why he changed his phone\u2019s passcode.\nBut Bruce has always enjoyed puzzles, and he likes to think he\u2019s quite good at them, too. And he doesn\u2019t need to know his passcode in order to check the time and, more importantly, the date. \nIt's 11:23 am, June 7th. It was June 6th when he went to bed. \nThe year is the same. \nTwelve hours. He has missed twelve hours. \nFor lack of anything better to do, Bruce tries the passcode again. Still wrong. \nHis thoughts are interrupted when the door opens, and a dark-haired boy walks in. Blue eyes, pale, doesn\u2019t look older than fourteen, but carries himself like an adult. Damian? \nThe boy startles when Bruce shifts, clearly surprised to see him awake. His eyes flit uncertainly to the door.\n\u201cGood morning,\u201d Bruce says before the kid can bolt. \n\u201cBruce,\u201d the kid says, and Bruce knows that whoever this is, it\u2019s not one of the people who were at his hospital bed last night. \u201cI-\u201c He sways, suddenly, and as he does, Bruce remembers something else from last night. \n\u201cDid you take a bullet for me?\u201d he asks, and gets his answer when Tim straightens, his expression smoothing out until his face reveals nothing. \n\u201cThe mission required it.\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d Bruce says carefully, keeping his tone even, both to soothe and to hide that he has no idea what mission Tim is referring to. \u201cI\u2019m just surprised to see you walking around.\u201d \nAt this, Tim, if possible, stills even more, doing his best impression of a statue. \u201cI wrote my report as soon as we returned to the Cave yesterday, and it\u2019s a Sunday. I don\u2019t have a meeting at Wayne Enterprises until tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d Bruce repeats. It occurs to him that Tim is standing as far away from him as possible, close enough to the door that it wouldn\u2019t take more than a step to leave. Slowly, making sure that Tim can track each movement, he lifts a hand and makes a wavey motion that he\u2019s seen people do on TV. \u201cCome sit with me.\u201d\nTim comes, his suspicion obvious. Following Bruce\u2019s encouraging nod, he sits down on the very edge of the bed. Bruce hides his smile. He remembers being a teenager, remembers a time when every second spent at home and talking to Alfred came close to torture. At least one of his children must be the same. \n\u201cAll I meant,\u201d he says, \u201cis that you were shot less than a day ago. You should be on bedrest, not sneaking around.\u201d And, since Tim is still eerily silent, still holds himself eerily motionless, he adds, \u201cI\u2019m worried about you, son.\u201d\nTim\u2019s head snaps around comically fast. Several seconds pass as he stares at Bruce, who makes sure to smile back supportively. His smile falls when Tim stands up. \n\u201cNightwing,\u201d he says, and it takes Bruce a moment to realise Tim is talking into an earpiece. \u201cCome back to the manor immediately. We need to check Batman for head trauma.\u201d\n*\nBruce lets them run several scans, allows them to draw his blood for a toxin check, correctly answers all questions about his name, the date and the current president, and in between he keeps asking after their wellbeing and whether Damian needs any help with his homework and if Tim is sure he doesn\u2019t want to go back to bed. He also, very subtly, examines his surroundings as though seeing the Batcave for the very first time. \n\u201cAmnesia,\u201d Dick declares once they have distracted Bruce (in other words, gave him today\u2019s crossword) and have gathered out of earshot. \u201cIt must be.\u201d\n\u201cHe got all our questions right,\u201d Tim protests. Dick already opens his mouth to object, but then help comes from an unexpected corner. \n\u201cTen minutes ago, that man recommended an \u201ceducational, yet spirited\u201d animated movie to me.\u201d The air quotes are audible, even though Damian has not actually moved. \u201cAmnesia does not create new memories. Father would never stoop so low as to watch television.\u201d\n\u201cOr at least admit to it,\u201d Dick says. He taps his finger against his lip, which Tim knows Dick stole from a tv show about detectives. It\u2019s not a very good show. As soon as Tim has finished season seventeen, he plans to send a stern letter to the producers detailing all the plotholes. \n\u201cMind control,\u201d Damian suggests, as if they haven\u2019t checked for that like, seven times already. \n\u201cMidlife-crisis,\u201d Tim offers.\n\u201cAn evil doppelganger,\u201d Dick says. Tim has to admit it\u2019s the most plausible theory so far.\n\u201cBoys,\u201d Bruce calls out, and all three of them freeze. But his eyes aren\u2019t shooting lasers, and he isn\u2019t throwing knives at them. Instead, he holds up the crossword. \u201cTen-letter word for dubious, starts with s?\u201d \nTim narrows his eyes at him. \u201cSuspicious.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the one,\u201d Bruce says, scribbling it down. \u201cGood job, buddy. Want to come help me with the rest?\u201d\nAnd- \nClearly there is something wrong with Bruce, and clearly somebody should, at some point, take care of this, and clearly that somebody is going to be Tim. \nBut Tim likes crosswords, and Bruce has never asked for help before. \nHe ignores the disbelieving looks Damian and Dick are shooting him, and walks over.\n*\nDick Grayson, Jason Todd, Tim Drake and Damian Wayne. Those are his sons. Those four boys are Bruce\u2019s sons. He has found adoption papers for two of them, and he thinks he might have kidnapped Tim because he distinctly remembers the Drakes to be his next-door neighbours, and he has found absolutely nothing on where Damian came from, but it doesn\u2019t matter, because overnight, Bruce has turned from not-a-father into a father-of-four, and he could not be happier. \nWhile he has been snooping around the whole day to find out more information on his children, his children have happily embraced his distraction to do some snooping of their own. Bruce doesn\u2019t mind. He wishes Dick didn\u2019t pretend to hug him in order to take some of his hair. If Dick wants a hug, he can just ask for it, and if he wants Bruce\u2019s hair, he can just ask for that, too. Bruce is fairly sure he would give his firstborn (his firstborn!) just about anything right now. \nHowever, besides being a father (a father!), he is also a reasonable man. He knows this can\u2019t go on, and the boys are definitely getting suspicious \u2013 at least, three of them are. He hasn\u2019t seen Jason yet, and since his phone is still locked, he has no chance of calling him, either. How often does he normally call Jason? Once a day? Every two days? Maybe Jason will call on his own, and then Bruce can answer. He keeps his phone close, just in case. \nThat\u2019s a problem for later, though, or at least for whenever Jason calls. For now, he needs to confide to somebody. And since he is an adult, and this is an adult problem, he confides to the one person in the house who is a) also an adult, and b) familiar to Bruce. Even though the last time he checked, that person had also died more than five years ago.\n\u201cCoffee, Master Bruce?\u201d\n\u201cTea, if you don\u2019t mind,\u201d Bruce says as he takes a seat. Something is frying on the stove, and the whole kitchen smells heavenly. \u201cNeed a hand with that, Alfred?\u201d\nAlfred looks, for lack of a better word, alarmed. Bruce has missed him so much he can\u2019t breathe. \u201cI thought we had mutually agreed to each stick to our own jobs after the last meatball incident, sir.\u201d\nAh. Bruce winces at the empty gap that is where surely his memory of any such incident should be. Maybe he hallucinated Alfred dying. Maybe this is a nervous breakdown. It must be. \nHe takes a sip of the steaming tea Alfred has poured for him, swallows down the pain and says, \u201cThat\u2019s actually what I came to talk to you about.\u201d\n\u201cMeatballs, Master Bruce?\u201d\n\u201cMore or less,\u201d Bruce says, and then he figures, screw it, there is no good way to say this, so he might as well just go for it. \u201cI\u2019ve forgotten the existence of my sons and I\u2019m worried it\u2019s turned me into a bad father.\u201d\nAt the first part of that sentence, Alfred had seemed unperturbed, but at the second part, his eyebrows shoot up. He is exactly like Bruce remembers.\n\u201cAm I a bad father?\u201d Bruce asks desperately.\nAlfred clears his throat. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me saying, sir \u2013 you\u2019ve certainly never worried about it before.\u201d \nThat\u2019s not an answer, and Bruce recognises it for the evasion it is. He buries his face in his hands, tea forgotten, and mutters, \u201cHow am I supposed to raise four children when I can\u2019t even remember their birthdays?\u201d\n\u201cMine is July 19th,\u201d Tim says, entering the kitchen and plopping down on a seat that\u2019s, though still out of Bruce\u2019s reach, not as far away as it could be. Bruce counts this as progress. \u201cAlso, I\u2019ve- what are you doing?\u201d\nWrong password.\nBruce stares dejectedly at his phone. \u201cI thought your birthday might be the code, but it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\u201cGive it here.\u201d Once Bruce has placed the phone in Tim\u2019s hand, he quickly types in four numbers and hands it back to him. \u201cWhose birthday is it?\u201d Bruce asks. \nTim snorts. \u201cNobody\u2019s. It\u2019s the day your parents died.\u201d\n\u201cWhat,\u201d Bruce says.\nTim gives a delicate shrug, faux-casual, but Bruce doesn\u2019t miss how he shifts himself just a little bit more out of reach. \u201cI\u2019m not really supposed to know about it, but my theory is that you use it to remind yourself that pain never stops. Actually,\u201d he quickly says before Bruce can react, \u201cthis is great stuff, because it confirms my theory.\u201d\n\u201cYour theory,\u201d Bruce repeats flatly.\nHis son (his son!) nods three times in quick succession. \u201cYou know all the basic information, like the date or the president, but you\u2019ve also gained a new knowledge in some areas while lost it in others. Losing information can just be memory loss, but why would you be familiar with a movie that\u2019s only just been released? Why are you drinking tea instead of coffee?\u201d Tim points at his cup almost accusingly. \u201cAnd your passcode \u2013 why would you forget that? All your bloodwork came back clear, so first we thought that maybe you\u2019re a clone, but that doesn\u2019t explain your selective memory. Dick suggested time travel, but earlier you looked like you\u2019ve never even seen the Batcave before \u2013 and I think that you haven\u2019t. I think that you\u2019re Bruce Wayne from an alternate universe. A universe where Bruce never became Batman, and definitely one where he never had a Robin. Also, apparently, one where he doesn\u2019t like coffee.\u201d Tim has said all of this in a rush and now takes a deep breath, his eyes gleaming. \nBruce is happy that Tim is so obviously pleased about his theory, but he also has to ask. \u201cTim,\u201d he says slowly, \u201cyou\u2019ve had a long day, and you\u2019re still suffering from a significant injury. Do you think perhaps you\u2019ve just had a nightmare, son?\u201d\nTim does not look contrite. Tim looks like he cannot believe what Bruce just said. \u201cOh my god,\u201d he says, \u201cBatman is gaslighting me. Alfred?\u201d\n\u201cOn it, Master Timothy.\u201d\nThe last thing Bruce feels is a syringe in his neck.\n*\nThe powerpoint has 493 slides and is titled WHY YOU ARE IN A DIFFERENT TIMELINE (AND I\u2019M NOT CRAZY). It has thirty-three slides less than the powerpoint Tim made earlier this afternoon for Dick and Damian, titled WHY BRUCE IS FROM A DIFFERENT TIMELINE (AND I\u2019M NOT CRAZY). He thinks Jason would have appreciated it, maybe, but Jason is not answering anyone\u2019s calls. Again. \nTherefore, this all depends on Tim. \nAgain. \nTo be fair, Dick had believed him at around slide no. 100, or at least he pretended to in order to get Tim to stop, and Damian, for the first time ever, didn\u2019t even oppose him in the first place. He seems, also for the first time ever, to believe him and Tim to be on the same side \u2013 them against this strange man in their house, them for getting the real Bruce back home. \n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to get him home,\u201d Tim had said, trying and mostly failing to be reassuring, \u201cbut we\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d\nThat had been an hour ago, before Tim confronted Bruce in the kitchen, before they had to sedate Bruce and tie him to a chair. The real Bruce would be furious with them, with all of them, but especially with Tim. \nOther Timeline Bruce is starting to come to, eyelashes fluttering, and Tim nervously flexes his fingers. \n\u201cLook,\u201d he says, \u201cI know you\u2019re probably like, super mad, but-\u201c\nBruce does not appear to be listening, his eyes fixed on the screen behind Tim, where the title of the powerpoint presentation can be seen. From behind Bruce, Dick gives him an encouraging thumbs up. Tim wishes Dick would stand by his side, but somebody has to stay close to Bruce in case anything goes wrong. \n\u201cSo,\u201d Tim says, clearing his throat, \u201cI\u2019ll try to make it quick-\u201c \u2013 Dick snorts \u2013 \u201cand if you have any questions, feel free to interrupt. So. Um.\u201d\nThis is so weird. Tim is normally fairly good at public speaking, but somehow, right now, Bruce\u2019s gaze on him feels heavier than usual. More likely to judge. Maybe because he knows what to expect from Real Bruce, what sort of behaviour is more or less likely to disappoint, but this Bruce is an unknown variable. It\u2019s way easier to get something wrong, to mess up, and then Tim will-\n\u201cHey,\u201d Bruce says, cutting through his thoughts. \u201cRelax, kiddo. It looks like you\u2019ve put a lot of work into this presentation, right?\u201d\nTim frowns. He supposes he has, though it hasn\u2019t been more effort than normal.\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m excited to hear it.\u201d\n\u201cUm,\u201d Tim says, because maybe Bruce hasn\u2019t understood what\u2019s going on. Maybe this Bruce is stupid. \u201cWe tied you to a chair.\u201d\n\u201cAnd very effectively, too. I can\u2019t move my arms at all. Who did the knotwork? Was it you?\u201d\n\u201cIt was me,\u201d Dick pipes up from behind him. Bruce tries and fails to turn around, but he smiles anyway.\n\u201cWell done. Excellent job.\u201d\nDick freezes for a second, before beaming as widely as Tim has ever seen him. \nThe distraction actually did a good job calming his nerves, and thus he starts his presentation. Throughout it all, Bruce is attentive and even interested, nodding at times as though to underline the point he\u2019s making. He sits through all the 493 slides without complaining once, and when Tim is finished, he says, \u201cAlright, I believe you.\u201d\nThis makes Tim pause. \u201cReally?\u201d\n\u201cYou made a convincing argument,\u201d Bruce says and then looks Tim in the eyes, face serious, as he says, \u201cBut I feel like I should point out, just to be on the same page, that you didn\u2019t need to go through all this trouble. I would have believed you no matter what.\u201d\nThat is obviously bullshit, because Bruce had literally questioned him like, two hours ago. \u201cYou literally questioned me like, two hours ago,\u201d Tim says. \u201cYou told me it was a nightmare.\u201d\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re a child who got shot yesterday.\u201d Bruce\u2019s voice is calm, patient. \u201cBut you\u2019re right, I did question you, and I was wrong. For that, I apologise.\u201d\nTim stares at him, and continues staring until he feels like his heart is beating fast enough that it\u2019s going to jump out of his chest. Blood is rushing in his ears, and he is pretty sure he couldn\u2019t talk right now even if he wanted to, because Bruce has never apologised to him before. Not once. \nIf he was still unsure whether his theory is correct, then this would be the moment that convinced him. \n\u201cI do have one question, actually,\u201d Bruce says, and Tim, still feeling like his world has just fundamentally shifted, nods at him. \u201cWho\u2019s Batman?\u201d\n*\nBruce has, apparently, swapped places with himself from an alternate timeline. Not actual places, just their consciousness, since his body has well over a hundred scars he does not remember, as well as a knife wound in his chest that he is still recovering from. Dick told him that once Tim took that bullet for him, Bruce got stabbed. \nWell. \nWhat he said, specifically, is, once Red Robin took that bullet for him, Batman got stabbed. \nBecause in this timeline, Bruce is a superhero. \n\u201cNot a superhero,\u201d Dick corrects him wearily, and not for the first time. \u201cA vigilante.\u201d\nBruce is a superhero, and he has a nemesis, like Captain America and Hydra. \n\u201cYou are not like Captain America\u201d, Dick says. \u201cCaptain America has super strength. If anything, Superman is Captain America.\u201d\nBruce has entered a world where men call themselves Superman or dress as giant bats, and they also get their children to fight for them. It\u2019s that point that grates on him the most. He could not care less what an alternate version of him does with his time, and if he wants to become a superhero, why not, Bruce himself once considered joining the cops before he realised that would mean carrying a gun. But.\nBut. \nRed Robin took a bullet for him. \n\u201cAnd Tim,\u201d he asks, keeping his tone quiet even though Tim and Damian had left him and Dick alone for this discussion, \u201cis my\u2026sidekick?\u201d \nAnd then Dick says, \u201cOh, no.\u201d\nHe says, \u201cTim hasn\u2019t been your sidekick in more than a year.\u201d\nHe says, \u201cWe gave that role to Damian.\u201d \nDamian. Who recently celebrated his tenth birthday. (Bruce needs to get him a present.)\n(Bruce needs to get all of them presents. There are so many birthdays he missed.) \nDamian, who, when pestered enough, showed him his math homework. They\u2019ve only just started with decimals in school. \nBruce made a kid who barely knows what decimals are his sidekick. \nWeary, because at this point, he can\u2019t be anything but, he asks, \u201cWhat about you?\u201d \nDick tilts his head, confused, before it dawns on him. He beams. \u201cI\u2019m Nightwing. I was the first Robin, actually, but that\u2019s a long time ago now.\u201d He launches into a story about one of their first adventures together, and Bruce tries to listen, he really does. But all he can think of is, how old was Dick when that happened? Did he know what decimals are? \nWhat on earth possessed him to make not just one, but three kids into mini-superheros and allow them to fight criminals? \nWait. \nHe doesn\u2019t have three kids. He has four. \nHe waits until Dick has finished, and gently interrupts him before he can start the next story. \u201cWhat about Jason?\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t think he imagines the way Dick pales. \u201cJason? What about him?\u201d\n\u201cWas he Robin, too?\u201d\nDick scratches his neck, evidently uncomfortable. He doesn\u2019t meet Bruce\u2019s eyes as he says, \u201cYeah. Jason was Robin, too.\u201d\n*\nJason is busy hacking through a guy\u2019s neck with a saw when the call comes. He ignores it, set on finishing this job before he can go home and sleep for a week, but then somebody says, \u201cRed Hood\u201d right into his earpiece, on a comm line that nobody should have. Then again, Tim has never much cared about that. \n\u201cI\u2019m kind of in the middle of something,\u201d he says and curses when some blood splatters on his mask. Getting blood stains out of clothes sucks. \u201cDon\u2019t hack my comm again.\u201d \n\u201cYou\u2019d have an easier time of it if you used a bone cutter,\u201d Tim tells him obnoxiously, confirming that he\u2019s hacked the cameras, too, like the little creep he is. Jason snorts. \n\u201cDon\u2019t let the big bat hear you say that.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a brief silence at the other end of the line. Jason uses it to finish up and putting the severed head in a bag. A jute bag, because he cares about the environment. He\u2019s not an asshole. \n\u201cHave you talked to him recently?\u201d Tim finally asks, sounding oddly uncertain.\nJason snorts again. \u201cYou know I haven\u2019t.\u201d \n\u201cYou should. He\u2019s- I think it\u2019s best if you come to the manor. See for yourself.\u201d \nJason shoulders the bag, delivers a kick to the headless body at his feet, and says, \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to do better than that, replacement\u201d before dropping his earpiece in a puddle. He is getting angry again, the kind of angry that makes him want to pick up the saw again and cut off a few more body parts. He knows when he\u2019s being manipulated, but you\u2019d think that Tim would at least try. He\u2019s so earnest in everything else, but he can\u2019t even bother to properly lie to Jason? Does he think Jason is an idiot? \nNo, Tim is smarter than that. This has to be part of a ploy. Reversed psychology or something. Well, Jason is not going to play into it. He\u2019s staying as far away from the manor as possible, and the next time Tim hacks his comm, he\u2019s going to have another thing coming. \nLess than twelve hours after the call, there\u2019s a knock at his door. The door of his safehouse. The safehouse that nobody knows about.\nOf course.\nJason has his gun out before he can fully think it through. This time, he promises himself, there\u2019s going to be blood to pay, and Tim won\u2019t- \nIt's not Tim standing outside his door. \nIt\u2019s Bruce, wearing a hoodie that says Superman and a hopeful expression on his face. Somehow, it\u2019s the stupid hoodie that makes Jason not slam the door immediately.\n\u201cJason,\u201d Bruce says, and it is Bruce talking, not Batman. For a blissful and also crazy weird second, it\u2019s like his dad is back. \nThen Bruce asks, \u201cIs that blood on your shirt?\u201d and the spell is gone.\n\u201cWhat if it is?\u201d Jason demands. \u201cGoing to arrest me? I have a gun here that says otherwise.\u201d\nBruce blinks. \u201cDo you have a licence for that?\u201d he asks, before chuckling. \nChuckling.\nBruce just chuckled. \n\u201cSorry, I keep forgetting \u2013 you\u2019re all superheroes. You probably don\u2019t need a licence. Still, though, are you injured?\u201d\n\u201cAm I- what?\u201d Jason asks slowly. His mind is still stuck on the superhero thing. \nBruce shoulders his way in, just shoving past Jason, who is too confused to do anything but let him pass. He makes his way into the bathroom, Jason following, and starts opening cupboards. \u201cWhere do you keep your first aid kit?\u201d\n\u201cBottom drawer,\u201d Jason says. What is happening?\nBruce opens the bottom drawer, makes a sort of aha noise upon successfully spotting the first aid kit, and motions for Jason to take off his shirt. Jason complies on instinct. \nThe next few minutes pass in a rush: Bruce shaking his head at the stab wound and Jason\u2019s poor attempt at bandaging it, Bruce looking wide-eyed at the many scars that mottle Jason\u2019s torso, Bruce disinfecting the wound and rewrapping the bandage, Bruce ruffling Jason\u2019s hair and telling him that he should go to bed and Bruce will be back soon with ice cream.\nAt this point, Jason is more or less convinced that this is a fever dream. \nHe goes to bed.\n*\nTwo out of four children are currently injured, and while one is safe in the manor, the other is, well, more or less safe in a rundown house in downtown Gotham. Since Bruce himself is currently also in said rundown house, and is therefore several miles away from the manor and his other injured child, he calls Dick and tells him to stuff Tim and Damian into one of the cars and come here. \n\u201cGet ice cream on the way,\u201d he says. \u201cAs much as you want, and make sure there\u2019s enough for Jason, too.\u201d\n\u201cWait a minute,\u201d Dick says. \u201cThe address you just gave me \u2013 is that Jason\u2019s address?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you soon,\u201d Bruce says and hangs up, but not before adding an, \u201cI love you\u201d. Verbal affirmations of love and cherishment are important. \nDuring the time it takes for Dick to manage his brothers and acquire ice cream, Bruce walks around the house \u2013 safehouse \u2013 and takes a note of everything that\u2019s missing. There\u2019s a microwave, but no kettle. There is only one towel. There is toothpaste, but only the cheap kind. There is a lot of instant ramen in the cupboards. Bruce frowns at all of this and is still busy writing out a grocery list when the door opens. \nHe doesn\u2019t miss that nobody rang the bell. \nDamian straightens, his hand casually falling to his pocket like he is not putting away a lock pick. Behind him, Tim and Dick are carrying five cones of ice cream between them. Tim has evidently practiced better self-restraint than Dick, who is halfway through eating his own ice cream and, since he needs both hands and can\u2019t wipe his mouth, has chocolate all over his face. \n\u201cDid Todd kidnap you?\u201d Damian demands. He glances from Bruce, to Jason\u2019s sleeping form on the bed, to Dick, his gaze turning accusing. \u201cYou said Todd kidnapped him.\u201d\n\u201cPossibly. I said possibly kidnapped him. If I had been one hundred per cent positive, would I have stopped for ice cream first?\u201d\nDamian scoffs and turns to Tim. \u201cDrake. Prove that you\u2019re not completely useless and hand me my cone.\u201d\nEven from where he is sitting at Jason\u2019s bedside, Bruce can see Tim\u2019s shoulders tensing, can see him reading himself for a retort. It\u2019s easy enough to guess how this might go on: Tim will retaliate, Damian won\u2019t let the insult stand, at some point somebody is getting an ice cream cone shoved in their face, and all of this would be very healthy sibling fighting if not for the fact that for the three days Bruce has been in this timeline, he has already seen the malicious nature to it. \nOne way or another, this stops now. \n\u201cDamian,\u201d he says, more sharply than he ever has. Both Damian and Tim come to attention. Dick, looking uncomfortable, subtly tries to wipe his mouth on his t-shirt. \u201cApologise to your brother.\u201d\nDamian sneers. \u201cDrake is not my brother. He-\u201c\n\u201cDamian.\u201d\n\u201cAs the blood son, I-\u201c\nBruce crosses his arms and waits. He can be very patient when he needs to be, and right now, he knows that if Damian goes for the waiting game, that\u2019s a game that Bruce is going to win. \nA minute passes, maybe more. The silence grows tenser with each second, and so does the unhappy look on Dick\u2019s face. But he\u2019s not going to interfere, and that\u2019s all that matters.\nFinally, Damian breaks eye contact. He mumbles something, too quiet to make out, but Bruce distinctly hears a \u201csorry\u201d, and that\u2019s enough. \n\u201cCome here,\u201d he says. In the background, Tim is staring at him like he\u2019s grown a second head, and Bruce is going to deal with that in a moment, but for now, he needs to make sure his lesson sticks. \nDamian reluctantly sits down next to him on the bed. It is clear to Bruce that what they need to discuss is not going to work with people listening in. He wants Damian relaxed, not on edge, or at least not more on edge than he already is. Jason is still asleep, but as for the others- \n\u201cTake a walk.\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Dick says, but Tim, a resigned look on his face, turns and is out the door within seconds of the request. Dick looks from him to Bruce, unsure, before cursing and going after Tim. The door shuts behind them, leaving Bruce and Damian to privacy, or at least to as much privacy as they\u2019re going to get. \n\u201cDamian,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you something that I haven\u2019t told any of the others. Can you keep a secret?\u201d\nDamian nods stiffly. Bruce hadn\u2019t expected anything less. \n\u201cFour days ago,\u201d he says into the quiet of the room, \u201cI had no children. This didn\u2019t make me upset. It wasn\u2019t that I actively chose not to have kids, it\u2019s just that the timing never quite worked out. That\u2019s just how it goes, sometimes. I didn\u2019t mind. There are bigger problems in the world than not being a parent. But when I woke up in this universe, and realised that not only am I a father, but that I\u2019m a father of four, I could not have been happier. When I grew up, I always wanted siblings. I was overjoyed by the fact that my children would grow up to have not just me, but each other.\u201d \nHe pauses, making sure that Damian is looking at him, before continuing. \u201cI\u2019m a father of four, not a father of one. Blood doesn\u2019t matter, paperwork doesn\u2019t matter. I don\u2019t care if we ever drew up official adoption paperwork, or if the other version of me kidnapped his neighbour\u2019s kid-\u201c\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201c-my point is that what matters is what\u2019s in the heart. And I, for one, know that I love all of you equally. Do you understand?\u201d\nThis silence is even longer than the last. Eventually, though, Damian bows his head. \u201cYou love us,\u201d he says. \u201cI will guard this secret with my life.\u201d\n\u201cUm,\u201d Bruce says. \n\u201cI will also,\u201d Damian says seriously, \u201clive your failed dream for you.\u201d\nFailed dream, Bruce mouths to himself. \n\u201cI will bond with my \u2013 siblings, and when you die, we will light the funeral pyre together.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Bruce says weakly. \u201cGreat. Thank you, chum.\u201d\n\u201cYou are welcome,\u201d Damian tells him.\nThe moment is broken when Jason stirs on the bed. He winces as he sits up, his wound presumably pulling at the movement, and Bruce hopes he doesn\u2019t rip any stitches. His frown gets more pronounced when he spots Damian. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s he doing here?\u201d\n\u201cBonding with you,\u201d Damian announces. \u201cWe have brought you ice cream. Where is it?\u201d\nLong melted by now, Bruce thinks. He stands, clapping Damian on the shoulder and reaching over to pat Jason on the head. Jason looks alarmed. \u201cI\u2019ll find your brothers and get some real food. We can have dessert afterwards. Pizza okay? I won\u2019t tell Alfred if you won\u2019t.\u201d Neither of them reply immediately, which Bruce takes as agreement. He nods at them. \u201cJason, watch your little brother, make sure he doesn\u2019t run off. Damian, watch your big brother, make sure he doesn\u2019t aggravate his wound. I\u2019m trusting you both with this.\u201d \nThe last he hears before the door closes behind them is Jason\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m not a babysitter\u201d. He smiles to himself. Kids.\nUnfortunately, while two of his kids are now busy with the task of babysitting each other, his other two kids are nowhere to be found. Bruce is in \u2013 Crime Alley? He thinks they call it Crime Alley here, and from all he\u2019s heard, it is not a safe neighbourhood for two children to be in, even if one of those children is in his mid-twenties and both of them are superheroes. \nHe tries calling, but they don\u2019t answer, so it looks like he\u2019s going to have to find them on foot. While he walks through the streets, he scrolls through his text messages, something he is finally able to do now that he knows the passcode. Dick texts him the most, but even that chat is suspiciously short, and the others are even worse. From what Bruce can tell, if his kids text him at all, he rarely replies. One time, Tim texted to ask if it was okay to spend the weekend at the manor, and Bruce left him on read for twelve hours, after which Tim texted again to say that it\u2019s fine and he\u2019s sorry for asking. Bruce left him on read again. \nHe has just realised that he took a wrong turn and landed in an alley that\u2019s a dead end, when he hears steps behind him. The steps have a menacing quality to them. \n\u201cTurn around with your hands up.\u201d\nBruce, for lack of anything better to do, turns around with his hands up. A man is pointing a gun at him, his hands shaking, his eyes bloodshot. \u201cHand over your purse and your phone.\u201d\n\u201cYou can have my purse,\u201d Bruce tells him, \u201cbut my phone is off-limits.\u201d He knows, realistically, that he can just buy a new phone and reprogram his kids\u2019 numbers. But that would take a while, and also, right now, two of his children are still missing. What if they call because they need his help?\n\u201cPurse and phone, now,\u201d the man barks. \u201cGet a move on.\u201d \n\u201cOkay,\u201d Bruce says, \u201calright. Let me just-\u201c He makes a show of patting down his pockets, frowning, patting them again. \u201cI\u2019m sure I have it here somewhere- maybe it\u2019s in the other pocket-\u201c\n\u201cHands back up,\u201d the man says, approaching him with unsteady steps. \u201cI\u2019ll look for them myself. You move, I blow your brains out.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Bruce says. The mugger is close enough to reach now, and Bruce is on him immediately, forcing the arm that\u2019s holding the gun up in the air, so that the resounding shot is fired into the sky. He takes the weapon from him, turns the safety back on, and hits the man across the face with it, all in one swift motion and hard enough that the man sags. Bruce checks that he\u2019s breathing before taking out his phone and calling the police. He leaves the gun with the mugger, but only after he\u2019s removed the bullets. \nHe doesn\u2019t wait for the police to arrive, instead resuming his search. He walks past several abandoned hair salons that are clearly a front for money laundering, ignores a bunch of men playing poker on the street using cut-off fingers instead of chips, and the streets are already looking slightly more cared-for and not as likely to be the background scene for a horror movie, when he hears voices. \n\u201c-didn\u2019t mean it,\u201d Dick says. \u201cI told you.\u201d\n\u201cHe never means it.\u201d That\u2019s Tim\u2019s voice. Bruce fastens his steps. \u201cHe never means it, and therefore he's never in the wrong, and as soon as they were alone, he probably told Bruce that I was, was provoking him or something, which is obviously crazy because why would I do that when I know that there\u2019s no point, and-\u201c \n\u201cBoys.\u201d They both flinch, turning to face Bruce from where he\u2019s just crossed a corner. They are leaning against a wall, Tim with his arms crossed, Dick radiating guilt with every muscle in his body. \u201cGot room for one more?\u201d\nThey part, and Bruce joins them at the wall, his upper right arm pressing warmly against Tim\u2019s shoulder, the other pressed against Dick\u2019s. He thinks this conversation might work better with no eye contact. \n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Tim says. The words sound practiced. \u201cI know he\u2019s younger, I know he was raised by assassins and doesn\u2019t know any better, and I didn\u2019t mean to cause a scene.\u201d\nBruce mentally notes raised by assassins as things to look into more closely in the future, and puts an arm around them both. Dick melts into the touch immediately, but Tim tenses, like he\u2019s unsure what is happening. \n\u201cThe reason I sent you out of that house,\u201d he says, \u201cis because some things need to be said without witnesses. What I talked about with Damian is between me and him, just like this conversation is between me and you two. But I am going to tell you the same thing I told him: You are siblings, not enemies. I expect you to act as such.\u201d\nDick winces, and Tim extricates himself from Bruce\u2019s grip, just slipping out under it and putting some space between them. \u201cI know,\u201d Tim says. \u201cI\u2019ll do better.\u201d\n\u201cDamian will do better,\u201d Bruce gently corrects. \u201cHe is going to improve his behaviour, and when he does, I would like you to encourage him. In the meantime, I need you to know that neither did you cause a scene, nor would I be upset with you if you did. You can cause as many scenes as you like. It\u2019s what your teenage years are for.\u201d\nTim opens his mouth and closes it, lost for words, but that\u2019s okay. Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day. \nBruce smiles at his boys. \u201cPizza?\u201d \nOn the way back, they walk past an alley that is encircled by several police cars. Even though he\u2019s in civilian clothes right now, Bruce can tell that Dick still wants to take a look, so he says, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Just a mugger. They\u2019re arresting him now.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know it\u2019s a mugger?\u201d Tim asks suspiciously. \n\u201cI got a little distracted when I was searching for you. But I took care of it.\u201d\nDick grips his shoulder, hard enough to bruise. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cWhat I said.\u201d\n\u201cBut-\u201c Dick looks around and lowers his voice. \u201cBut you\u2019re a civilian,\u201d he hisses. \u201cJust a civilian.\u201d\n\u201cDick,\u201d Bruce says patiently, \u201cI may be from an alternate timeline with no people running around in masks, but we have crime too. My parents were killed in a robbery when I was eight. That\u2019s forty years ago. Plenty of time to learn how to defend myself.\u201d\n\u201cBut,\u201d Dick says again, and stops, like he has run out of things to say. \n\u201cNot here,\u201d Tim says, pointedly nodding towards the police cars. \u201cWe can discuss it when we\u2019re home.\u201d \n\u201cI just,\u201d Dick says, and to Bruce\u2019s surprise, Tim, who has never once initiated touch since he\u2019s woken up in this universe, lays a hand on Dick\u2019s shoulder. \n\u201cDick. I get it. But this isn\u2019t the time or the place.\u201d\nDick breathes in shakily. Nods. Breathes again. \u201cAlright,\u201d he says. \u201cYeah, alright. Let\u2019s get pizza.\u201d\n*\nFive days after Tim was shot and Bruce woke up all wrong, Tim enters the kitchen to find Bruce already up. This in itself is not that strange; Real Bruce is a late sleeper, but that\u2019s mostly because he spends his nights on patrol. Without that, there is no real reason for him to be up until four in the morning. \nWhat is surprising, however, is that Bruce is a. in a suit and b. making sandwiches. Alfred is nowhere to be seen. \nTim rubs his eyes and blinks, but the picture says the same. Bruce, spotting him, waves at him with a buttery knife. \u201cMorning,\u201d he says. \u201cYou mentioned last night that you\u2019d be going back to school today.\u201d\nTim is fairly certain he has said nothing of the sort. If he recalls correctly, what he said yesterday is, I\u2019m well on my way to recovery, so there is no reason why I shouldn\u2019t work tomorrow. Bruce must have interpreted work as school. Not an unreasonable assumption to make, considering the circumstances, but one Tim must correct nevertheless. Except-\n\u201cAre you\u2026making me lunch?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve made lunch for Damian for the past few days,\u201d Bruce says, going back to spreading peanut butter on toast, \u201cand since you feel better now, I\u2019m making lunch for you, too.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Alfred\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cLeft me to my task. He understands this is something a father needs to do for his boys.\u201d Bruce smiles, finishes the sandwich, and moves on to the next. \nThere is something stuck in Tim\u2019s throat, something that no amount of convulsive swallowing will remove. His boys. Tim knows, has always known, that before Jason\u2019s death, Dick and Jason had a different relationship with Bruce, a relationship that\u2019s in no way comparable to Bruce\u2019s relationship with Tim. But still, to hear him say it like this \u2013 to hear Tim included \u2013 makes him feel weird, like his skin is all itchy.\nStill, though. Bruce\u2019s mistake is understandable, but still a mistake. \nTim clears his throat, trying to get rid off the lump. \u201cI don\u2019t- I dropped out of high school, actually.\u201d\nThe hand holding the knife stills, but only for a second. \u201cOh?\u201d Bruce says, clearly aiming for a neutral tone. \n\u201cLast year. You- our- Batman died. Dick took over the vigilante thing, but there was still Wayne Enterprises to consider. Jason is still legally dead, Dick was stressed out enough already in between being Batman and raising Damian, and Damian was too young. I stepped up.\u201d\nBruce has given up all pretence of preparing lunch and instead gives Tim a strange look. \u201cYou\u2019ve taken over Wayne Enterprises.\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Tim says, wondering if he\u2019s about to be told what in inadequate choice he is. \n\u201cYou\u2019ve become CEO at, what, thirteen-\u201c\n\u201cSixteen. I\u2019m almost seventeen now,\u201d Tim adds helpfully. \n\u201c-you\u2019ve become CEO of my company, and you dropped out of high school for it?\u201d\nTim nods.\nThere\u2019s a clash as the knife lands on the counter. Bruce is on him in two steps, and the next thing Tim knows, he\u2019s being pressed very tightly against Bruce\u2019s body. Hugged? Is he being hugged? Is that what this is? \nBruce doesn\u2019t say anything, just holds him close, and after a few seconds, Tim relaxes. His skin has stopped itching, and he thinks he could grow to enjoy this feeling. Dick has hugged him many times, but the closest Jason came to him is when he almost beat him to death, Damian has made his feelings clear, and Bruce \u2013 Real Bruce \u2013 has sometimes clapped him firmly on the shoulder, but he\u2019s never done this. \nBruce\u2019s next words send an icy shower through him.\n\u201cYou\u2019re quitting,\u201d he says as he pulls away. \n\u201cWhat?\u201d Tim says. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d\n\u201cYes, you are. I\u2019m not dead now, am I?\u201d\nTim takes a second to consider this. \u201cTrue,\u201d he concedes, \u201cbut you- Batman wasn\u2019t dead for the last year or so, either. He seemed fine with letting me continue my work. I don\u2019t think he liked his job very much.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re sixteen,\u201d Bruce says, like that explains everything. \u201cI\u2019m an adult. If I don\u2019t like my job, I can get a different one. That\u2019s how it works.\u201d\n\u201cBut-\u201c\n\u201cLuckily,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019m not Batman, and I do actually enjoy what I do. So I\u2019m taking back over as CEO, which I would have done anyway, and you\u2019re officially fired. What\u2019s your school? Gotham Academy?\u201d Bruce waits for Tim\u2019s reluctant nod before getting out his phone.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Tim demands, alarmed. \n\u201cGetting you back enrolled.\u201d \nThis is crazy. Does Bruce realise how crazy this is? \u201cDo you realise how crazy this is?\u201d Tim asks, just to be sure. \nBruce is, for some reason, frowning down at his screen. \u201cThis school\u2019s website says their extracurricular activities are mostly focused on sports. This is unacceptable.\u201d\n\u201cI can do sports,\u201d Tim offers, even though he would really prefer not to. He trains literally every day, and he gets even more exercise at night. He doubts that being on the rowing team would change much.\n\u201cDo you want to do sports?\u201d Bruce counters, and Tim has no good reply to that. Luckily, Bruce isn\u2019t waiting for one. Only about a minute after firing Tim, he is on the phone with the headmaster. Tim takes that opportunity to leave, but only after Bruce has just made a reference to yesterday\u2019s PTA meeting. For an insane second there, it sounded like Bruce had joined the PTA, and Tim doesn\u2019t plan to stick around and find out if that\u2019s true.\n*\n\u00a0The bare walls of his bedroom are slowly driving Bruce insane. After two weeks in this timeline, he has learned many things about his children and, based on that, reached his own conclusions about his counterpart. He has opinions on that, of course he does, but hasn\u2019t voiced them for now. He reminds himself frequently that he does not know if, or when, he will return to his own universe, that it could be tomorrow or next month, and that the only thing he can do in the meantime is to be the best dad possible and to also not ruin his children\u2019s relationship with their existing dad, no matter what he might think of him.\nSo he makes them packed lunches, he ruffles their hair and tells them how proud he is, he listens to their stories and asks them to call if they\u2019ll be home late. He does all that, and he keeps his mouth shut. \nBut the walls. \nWhere are all the pictures, he wants to ask his counterpart. Where are the photographs that show his kids, growing up or already grown? Where are the pictures they drew, in school or at home, with clumsy fingers or more skilled? Where are the photos that they took themselves? Where are the mismatched vases that they made, the table mats, the pasta necklaces? The essays and tests and report cards, what about them? What did his counterpart do with those? \nEvery morning he wakes up, not to an alarm, but to his inner clock, finely tuned to wake him six o\u2019clock every day without fail. And every morning the first thing he sees are the empty walls. \nEnough.\nHe corners Damian first, because he already knows that his youngest son takes art classes, and also because he is sure that his other kids would be much more suspicious. \nThen again, Damian is frowning at him as soon as he says, \u201cCan I have a moment of your time, buddy?\u201d, so maybe that guess was wrong.\nHe leads them into the kitchen, where he has asked Alfred to prepare hot chocolate and cookies as both a snack and a bribe. A part of him still cannot quite believe that he can ask Alfred to do things again, that Alfred is really alive and breathing. It makes his eyes sting every time he thinks about it.\nDamian ignores the cookies, but he does take a small sip of the hot chocolate, so that\u2019s a win for step one of the plan: make Damian comfortable. \nNow comes step two. \n\u201cSay, I don\u2019t know all that much about art,\u201d Bruce says. \u201cBut a little birdie told me that I have a veritable expert right here in the manor.\u201d\n\u201cDr- Timothy sold me out?\u201d Damian growls. He looks murderous, but he\u2019s also at least attempted to use Tim\u2019s first name, so that\u2019s progress. Even so-\n\u201cTim hasn\u2019t said a word.\u201d And Bruce really should have known better than to use a bird metaphor in a house full of boys who either currently go, or used to go, by some version of the name Robin. \u201cAs a matter of fact, I talked to your teacher.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nBruce falters. \u201cIt was parent-teacher conference last night. I thought you knew about that.\u201d\n\u201cI did. I was unaware that you also knew.\u201d Damian seems disgruntled by this discovery. His bad mood is hard to take seriously, though, when he has a milk moustache on his upper lip. \nOf course he knows, Bruce wants to say, but hesitates. That\u2019s not the point here. He can talk to Damian about just how involved Bruce has become in his school at some later time. \u201cI talked to your art teacher,\u201d he tries again, attempting to get them back on track. \u201cShe showed me your last project, and I thought it was really good. She wouldn\u2019t let me take it home with me because it hasn\u2019t been graded yet, so I figured I\u2019d ask you to make me a new one, just for me.\u201d\nDamian cocks his head, like a cat. \u201cYou wish me to make you a painting with potato printing?\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d \n\u201cNo,\u201d Damian snaps, as fierce as though Bruce has just told him he\u2019s thinking of replacing Damian with a better-mannered lamp. \u201cThis \u2018potato printing\u2019 is beneath me, and it was demeaning of that teacher to force us to do a task meant for toddlers. I think it is some form of psychological torture designed to break my will,\u201d he confesses to Bruce, glancing around in paranoia. Bruce, for lack of a better reaction, nods along. \u201cI will make you a better picture,\u201d Damian decides. \u201cA real one. Not using vegetables. What\u2019s your favourite animal?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been partial to anteaters,\u201d Bruce says. \u201cTheir noses make me laugh. They\u2019re so long.\u201d\nNever has he ever seen Damian look at him with such obvious judgement. \u201cAnteaters,\u201d he repeats in disgust. \u201cFine. I will draw you anteaters.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait, buddy,\u201d Bruce tells him, and means it.\nHe doesn\u2019t have to decide which of his kids to approach next, because they approach him first, specifically: Tim. He knocks on Bruce\u2019s office, well, one of his seventeen offices, after school, and takes a seat at the desk, back ramrod straight. Bruce signs a document, recaps the pen, and takes off his half-moon glasses before giving Tim his full attention. \nAt first, he thinks his son is here to have another conversation about high school, or to be more precise, another conversation on why high school is unnecessary. Bruce doesn\u2019t particularly mind. He has zero experience with raising teenagers, but he does think this is a healthy stage of their development. And since Tim is apparently sixteen and not, as he\u2019d previously assumed, in his early teens, he\u2019s exactly at that age where kids are most likely to question authority. Of course Tim thinks high school is stupid. Of course Tim wants to drop out. Of course Tim is presumably one provocation away from getting a piercing and threatening to go sleep under a bridge just to provoke Bruce. Bruce\u2019s job is to keep him away from sketchy piercing parlours and to make sure he graduates, and anything else he can bring up when Tim has children of his own. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d he asks once it becomes clear that Tim has no intention of speaking first. \nTim\u2019s eyes flit around the room, focusing on anything but Bruce. \u201cDamian says you asked for a drawing.\u201d \n\u201cI did,\u201d Bruce says. \n\u201cAnd Dick mentioned that you said something about the walls in your bedroom?\u201d\n\u201cI did.\u201d Bruce hadn\u2019t realised Dick had picked up on that. It had been a throwaway comment, more to himself than to his son. \n\u201cHe didn\u2019t really get it- he asked if I knew what you meant. And I did. I do. The walls in my parents\u2019 house weren\u2019t bare, we always had lots of expensive art. But my friends\u2019 houses always had plenty of family photos. I mean, we had a family portrait, but that\u2019s only one, and when I was seven my mom put it in the garage because we redecorated and it didn\u2019t fit the colour scheme anymore. So.\u201d\n\u201cI see,\u201d Bruce says, even though he doesn\u2019t. All he knows is that Janet and Jack Drake sound like assholes, and now he\u2019s glad that in his own timeline, he didn\u2019t agree to do a business deal with them. \n\u201cSo,\u201d Tim says, more forcefully, \u201cI wanted to offer- I\u2019m not very good at drawing, but I still have my old camera around somewhere, from when I used to take photos of Batman and Robin. I could take pictures of everybody. So that you\u2019d have something to put up your walls.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Oh.\u201d \n\u201cOr not,\u201d Tim says quickly. \u201cIt was stupid. Batman always said that anything can be used as evidence, especially personal stuff, and we should keep that in mind.\u201d\n\u201cTim,\u201d Bruce says, and Tim finally looks at him. \u201cI would be honoured. But I have a condition. Tomorrow, or whenever you\u2019re free, we go to a store, and you help me pick out a camera of my own. In turn for your help, you can pick out whatever you want in that shop.\u201d\n\u201cBut- why do you want a camera? I told you. I can take pictures.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I can\u2019t wait to see them. But you forgot something very important. If you\u2019re the one taking the pictures, who takes pictures of you?\u201d When Tim frowns, about to protest, Bruce says, \u201cIt\u2019s not just about filling my walls. It\u2019s about filling my walls with things that remind me of the people I love. You\u2019re a part of that.\u201d \nTim looks like he has trouble processing this, but he doesn\u2019t outright object, and the next day, he goes camera-shopping with Bruce. The day after, Bruce wakes up to two new additions to his wall. First is a beautifully drawn picture of an anteater family. He counts five of them, one significantly larger than the rest. \nThe other is a selfie, obviously taken with a phone and not with the camera he\u2019s bought Tim, printed out hastily and put up while he was still asleep. It shows his four kids, smiling or scowling or making silly faces. Bruce\u2019s answering smile is so wide that it hurts his cheeks. Take that, Batman, he thinks. 1:0.\n*\nSomewhere far away, in a very different Gotham, Batman resists the urge to punch a wall. They don\u2019t have magic here. They don\u2019t even have particularly bad crime statistics here. Everybody is more excited about the latest iPhone than about stabbing someone forty-one times with a steak knife just because they took the last soda, which is what happened in Batman\u2019s Gotham two weeks ago. \nSimply put, there is no way for Batman to get home on his own. \nHe is sure that Red Robin is already working on a solution, and he trusts Nightwing to keep everyone in line while he\u2019s gone. But he doesn\u2019t know how long it will take Red Robin. Last time it took him a year. \nBatman cannot wait a year. He can\u2019t stay in a universe where his counterpart is signed up for three different yoga classes. \nSo he goes to the only person who might be able to help. \nHe goes to Drake Manor next door.\nBATMAN HAS LEFT US FLYING BLIND (more on page seven)\nGONE BATTY? WHERE HAS BATMAN GONE?\nBREAKING NEWS: GOTHAM IS HAVING A BAT TIME WITHOUT ITS FAVOURITE VIGILANTE\nFor nearly three weeks, Gotham has stayed vigilante-free, as the vigilantes in question have either been taken to a different timeline (Batman) or gone on an impromptu vacation to watch the person who has taken his place (not Batman). For nearly three weeks, it\u2019s worked. Batman and Robin have never truly been able to stop most crimes that happen, anyway. It\u2019s not so much about stopping them as it\u2019s about prevention. Batman works on a system based in large parts on fear and shadows. \nFor nearly three weeks, nobody even notices that Batman is gone. \nThen, there\u2019s an explosion in an old industrial building in Crime Alley that\u2019s turned out to not be as abandoned as everyone assumed, and everyone is on high alert. \nWell.\nEveryone meaning Dick, Tim and Damian. Jason is out doing his own thing, like killing people with a chainsaw while laughing like a maniac, and Bruce has his half-moon glasses on and keeps nodding off in his armchair while the news is playing in the background.\nThe news, where the anchor just showed footage of the explosion. \n\u201cTo the Cave,\u201d Dick says as everyone stands up at once. \u201cRobin, you\u2019re with me. We\u2019ll work on getting people out of there. Red Robin, you see if you can get any details on what happened, who\u2019s responsible. No going anywhere before you check in.\u201d \n\u201cGot it,\u201d Damian and Tim say simultaneously, and leave. Dick is already on the go as well, but turns at the door, torn. The man napping in the armchair is not Batman. He knows this. He does not expect a civilian Bruce to put on a cape, not without training, not like this. But- \n\u201cHey. Hey, Bruce, wake up.\u201d \nBruce blinks sleepily up at him, but the minute he catches sight of Dick\u2019s face, he sobers, instantly alert. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d\n\u201cExplosion downtown. We\u2019re going out now to take care of it.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Bruce says, voice sharp. \u201cWho\u2019s we?\u201d\nDick has no time for this. He puts a hand on Bruce\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWe should be back by morning. You can ask Agent A \u2013 Alfred for the details. For now, just don\u2019t go out under any circumstances. We\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d And, because Bruce has a look on his face like his whole world is falling apart and Dick feels bad about it, he does, he adds, \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d\nIt's not enough, he knows it\u2019s not, but that\u2019s just the way it\u2019s going to have to be for now.\n\u201cWhat took so long?\u201d Tim asks when Dick finally arrives in the Batcave. \n\u201cNothing,\u201d Dick says shortly. They have other matters to attend to. \nFor the rest of the night, they\u2019re busy. Nightwing and Robin start a rescue mission that takes several hours, and Red Robin\u2019s investigation is interrupted by Scarecrow, not because he has something to do with it, just because he heard about the explosion and thought he could join in on the fun and chaos. It\u2019s not great, it\u2019s not the cleanest operation they\u2019ve ever done, but in the end, it works, everyone is safe, and Red Robin has made an arrest.\nBruce is waiting for them when they get home. He must have stayed up all night, deep circles under his eyes that are dark enough to rival Tim\u2019s, and he looks wrecked. \n\u201cIs everyone safe?\u201d he asks. \u201cThey didn\u2019t say so on the news. Is everyone okay?\u201d\nIt\u2019s at the same time very similar to and very different from Batman asking them for a report at the end of a mission, asking if they\u2019re injured to plan the next mission accordingly, to figure out who needs more additional training, who should be scolded and/or benched. \nWell. \nDick suspects that that last part is still going to hold true. \n\u201cEveryone is fine,\u201d he says. \u201cDamian, Tim, upstairs. Now.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t answer to you,\u201d Damian sneers, but Tim, glancing between Dick and Bruce, seems to realise that something is about to go down, because he takes Damian\u2019s hand \u2013 Bruce\u2019s bonding exercises have either worked in a spectacular fashion, or Tim has gotten a hit on the head tonight after all \u2013 and leads him out of the Cave. \nDick crosses his arms, chin held high as he faces Bruce. \u201cLet\u2019s hear it.\u201d\n\u201cWhat you did tonight was reckless,\u201d Bruce says. He says it calmly, no anger bleeding into his tone at all, and that makes it worse. \u201cI realise I\u2019m new to this universe. I realise I have no idea what it\u2019s like to put on a cape and go out fighting crime. I don\u2019t know much about your supervillains, and what they might do if there were no more superheroes. I acknowledge this. I also acknowledge that you\u2019re an adult, and that I can\u2019t tell you what to do. But tonight, you put not just yourself in danger, but you dragged your brothers into it, too. That\u2019s unacceptable.\u201d\n\u201cThey chose this life,\u201d Dick counters. He\u2019s trying to emulate Bruce\u2019s calm, but he\u2019s not succeeding. This reminds him too much of his arguments with the other Bruce, the screaming matches that threatened to bring down the manor around them. \u201cThey want this life. I\u2019m not taking that choice away from them.\u201d\n\u201cDamian is ten years old, Dick. Ten. If we let him, he\u2019d choose to not go to school and only eat candy for dinner every day, too. That\u2019s why we don\u2019t allow children to make these decisions until they\u2019re old enough to be sensible about it.\u201d\n\u201cTim chose not to go to school, and you seemed fine with it,\u201d Dick says. Bruce flinches, and he doesn\u2019t know why, until Bruce says: \n\u201cI was not fine with it. I enrolled him back as soon as I realised he had dropped out.\u201d \nOh. Right. Wrong Bruce. Dick feels like he\u2019s standing in a deep fog, with everything moving more slowly around him, slightly out of synch.\n\u201cAre you firing me?\u201d he asks. His tongue feels numb. \n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re fired, Dick. Get out of my Cave.\n\nHe's Nightwing now, though, he reminds himself. Batman can\u2019t fire him, can\u2019t-\n\u201cDick? Are you okay, son?\u201d\nIt's unfair, Dick thinks. He\u2019s trying so hard, he\u2019s been trying so hard. He wants to do a good job at being Nightwing, to prove to Batman that he is devoted, he is-\nAnything less than total devotion to this cause is simply wasting my time.\n- but he wants to be a good brother, too. He tried with Jason, and he failed, and he tried again with Tim, and he failed that, too, and if Bruce is saying he can\u2019t even be a good brother to Damian now, then what is Dick doing? What\u2019s the point of him then? \n\u201cBreathe, Dick.\u201d Someone is touching him. Batman. \u201cYou\u2019re okay. You\u2019re fine.\u201d No, not Batman. Bruce. \nDick breathes, and soon enough, the world comes into focus again. They\u2019re still in the Batcave, but the man in front of him is not the same man who fired him all those years ago. \n\u201cLook at me,\u201d Bruce demands quietly, and Dick does. This Bruce\u2019s eyes are the exact same shade of blue as the other\u2019s \u2013 of course they are, since they only swapped consciousnesses. But they still look different, somehow. Dick just can\u2019t put his finger on why. \u201cI\u2019m upset, and I wish you would see my side of it. But I\u2019m sorry if I made you uncomfortable just now. I never mean to make you feel inadequate, Dick. It\u2019s not about that. I just don\u2019t understand how someone as big-hearted as you can seriously justify allowing children to fight crime.\u201d\nDick breathes in shakily, breathes back out, and reminds himself that this is not Batman. Different timelines, different men. \u201cI was sixteen when I became Robin. And I know how that sounds, I know it sounds bad, but at that point I\u2019d been training for several years. I was prepared, I was ready.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Bruce nods. \u201cI can see how that would seem okay. Did the others train for several years, too?\u201d He sounds like he already knows the answer, but he can\u2019t possibly, not when until this moment, Dick never even thought about this himself. \n\u201cJason was trained by Batman for six months. He was-\u201c He hesitates. \u201cHe was twelve. Both when Batman found him, and when he started as Robin.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Bruce repeats. \u201cAnd Tim? Did he get six months of training, too?\u201d\nDick hesitates once more. \u201cYes,\u201d he says reluctantly. \n\u201cBut?\u201d\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t trained by you. Batman trained him for only a few weeks before sending him abroad to complete his training elsewhere.\u201d\n\u201cI see,\u201d Bruce says. He does not sound like he sees. \u201cWhat about Damian?\u201d\nDick swallows convulsively. He\u2019s not stupid, he knows that so far, Bruce, even though he gave no outward indication of it, has been silently judging his other universe\u2019s counterpart for these choices. But Damian is not a choice Bruce made for himself. \n\u201cI was the one to ask Damian to be Robin,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cHe was nine. It happened last year when we thought Batman had died and I took up the role of Batman for myself.\u201d \n\u201cDick-\u201c Bruce starts, but Dick is on a roll now. He has to say this, has to confess all his sins, before he loses courage.\n\u201cDamian was trained,\u201d he says, \u201cbetter trained than any of us, probably. He\u2019s spent the majority of his life with the League of Assassins. And then he came here, and you didn\u2019t like him, and he lashed out in return. You were the only one he respected, and it was so obvious that you didn\u2019t want him there. He needed a father. When his father died, I thought that if he couldn\u2019t have that, if he couldn\u2019t have you, he could have the next-best thing. So I made him Robin, to give him a purpose, to ground him. It worked. But there\u2019s always a price, and that price was Tim. He still hasn\u2019t quite forgiven me, I think. Not for taking Robin away from him, and not for not believing him about Batman being alive, either. I gained one little brother last year and lost another one. That\u2019s two little brothers I\u2019ve lost, now.\u201d\nDick bows his head, ready to await judgement.\nBruce hugs him. \n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says, his voice a rambling baritone that soothes Dick\u2019s nerves as much as the hug does. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry that you were in that position. That you had to make these choices. That I wasn\u2019t there to take that burden away from you.\u201d\n\u201cYou were dead,\u201d Dick mumbles into Bruce\u2019s neck. \u201cAnd also in a different timeline. It wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Bruce says. \u201cI\u2019m still sorry. For all of it. For everything my counterpart did or failed to do, and for every moment I spent in that other timeline, not even knowing that I had sons, unaware that they needed me. I wish I could have been there for all of you.\u201d\nDick is crying, he realises suddenly. Tears are streaming down his face and he hadn\u2019t even noticed. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he says, and means it. \u201cYou\u2019re here now.\u201d\n*\nBruce thinks long and hard about the best way to go about this, and in the end, he decides that there is really only one thing that might have a chance of working. So he\u2019s going to try that, and he\u2019s going to do his humanly best to not screw this up.\nAfter he calls a family meeting in the dining room, it\u2019s not a big surprise that Damian is the one to arrive first. What does surprise him is that Jason is second, followed immediately by Tim, who looks very pleased with himself. He also has what might be a developing bruise on his face, but that must be only a small setback in what is otherwise undoubtedly joy over having not just gotten Jason to attend, but to having also won one week of pretend sick leave in school, signed by Bruce as the promised reward for his victory.\nDick is last. He slinks into the room like a man ready to face the executioner. Of course, he\u2019s also the only one of Bruce\u2019s children who knows, or at least suspects, what is about to go down, so maybe that\u2019s not that surprising.\nBruce waits until everybody is seated, then closes the doors. Everyone visibly starts. For the past few weeks, Bruce has made it a point of always leaving his office door open, making sure that he\u2019s available at all times. Now, he hasn\u2019t actually locked them in, but just the act of shutting the door seems to be enough to make everybody tense.\nTaking a deep breath, Bruce turns back to face them \u2013 these four boys, his four children, the sons he never knew about and who have, in a few short weeks, become the most important thing in his life.\nHe hopes they don\u2019t start hating him after this.\n\u201cBefore we begin, I would like to remind you all of one simple fact. I am not Batman, I have never been Batman, and I do not intend to ever become Batman. I realise that in some people\u2019s eyes, this may make me seem like the weaker version. I understand if that\u2019s what you think, too. But I want you to remember that what I\u2019m about to do is something Batman would never manage. I\u2019m not going to use my authority as your guardian or boss to command something. I\u2019m going to make a request.\u201d\n\u201cGo on,\u201d Jason says, though his uncertain look betrays his faux-confident tone. \u201cJust say it.\u201d\nBruce makes sure to look each of them in the eye once, before saying, to the room at large: \u201cI would like you all to give up being vigilantes.\u201d\n\u201cWhat,\u201d Jason says, \u201cthe fuck.\u201d\n\u201cLanguage,\u201d Dick says automatically, but he sounds tired more than anything. He\u2019s sounded tired since talking to Bruce yesterday.\n\u201cDon\u2019t\u00a0language\u00a0me, asshole. Did you hear what he just said?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a but coming,\u201d Tim says suddenly, ignoring his brothers\u2019 argument and instead looking directly at Bruce. \u201cIsn\u2019t there?\u201d\n\u201cThere is,\u201d Bruce confirms, and Jason and Dick fall silent. \u201cLike I said, it\u2019s only a request. However, I\u2019m fully aware that not only are two of you over eighteen, but I am also an impostor in this world. I have no legal authority over any of you. Even if I did, I doubt that I could stop you. Ultimately, you may do what you like. What I\u2019m asking of you,\u201d he says, \u201cis to let me present my case. Hear me out at least before you condemn my words.\u201d\nSlowly, reluctantly, they nod, all of them except Damian, who has yet to speak up or even move. But Bruce would be a fool to think that this means his youngest son isn\u2019t listening to every word he says.\nHe sighs. He has thought long and hard about the best way to go about this, and in the end, he decided that there was really only one thing that might have a chance of working.\nTell the truth.\nSo he does.\n\u201cI look at you,\u201d he says quietly, \u201cand I see children. I see children who have been groomed into joining a war that is not their own, children who feel like their lives are immutably tied to the cause. I see a child who has died, and I see three others who would be willing to do the same. And it makes me angry with my counterpart, but most of all, it makes me sad. I look at all of you, and I feel like my heart is breaking. I\u2019ve only just gained four children. Perhaps it\u2019s selfish, but I\u2019m not ready to lose any of you so soon. Not because of a pointless war that some ill-adjusted version of myself has started.\u201dIt\u2019s out there now. Words that can\u2019t be taken back, not that Bruce would want to. He means what he said.\nThere\u2019s a horrible screeching noise as Jason\u2019s chair gets pushed back, scraping over the hardwood floor and falling to the ground as Jason carelessly stands up and storms out, not looking back once. The entire thing has taken less than five seconds.\nDick moves as if to go after him, but Bruce holds up a hand. \u201cLeave him for now. Give him time to calm down.\u201d\nDick slumps back into his chair, clearly lost now that his task has been taken from him. His hands twitch, his eyes glancing between his brothers like he wants to reach out for either or both. But where the Dick Bruce has gotten to know so far would have not hesitated in initiating physical contact, this new, silent Dick who has emerged after yesterday\u2019s talk keeps his hands to himself. It makes Bruce want to reach out himself, but it\u2019s not the time for that. Not yet.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat I propose,\u201d he says, \u201cis a compromise.\u201d\nTim\u2019s head snaps up at that, blue eyes nailing Bruce down with a piercing stare. \u201cWhat kind of compromise?\u201d\n\u201cCompromises are for the weak,\u201d Damian sneers. \u201cWaynes do not compromise.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cRed Robin and Robin,\u201d Bruce says, noting their surprise at his use of their codenames, \u201care restricted to the Batcave until they are eighteen, or until a major crisis breaks out. In the Batcave, they are allowed to help out over the comms, or in any other fashion they deem fitting, so long as they stay within the parameters of the Cave.\u201d\n\u201cUnacceptable. I turn eighteen in eight years.\u201d\u00a0\nBruce is not an idiot. He had expected protests, and he had expected them most from Damian. Damian, who has been groomed since birth. He\u2019s not proud of it, but the strategy he's thought up includes some manipulation of his own. \n\u201cThat is eight years more to train,\u201d he says, and feels Damian\u2019s gaze sharpen. \u201cEight years to become stronger, faster, better. And you\u2019re forgetting something. You\u2019re not just Robin. You\u2019re a Wayne, too. You need to keep up the family image,\u201d says Bruce, who could not care less about the family image. \u201cThat requires education,\u00a0good grades, having a functioning social life, attending charity galas with me or your brothers. This is a duty you can\u2019t just shirk, and it\u2019s going to require a lot of your attention. I expect you to give it your all.\u201d\nHe knows he\u2019s found the magic words when Damian nods sharply. \u201cThat,\u201d his youngest son says, \u201cis acceptable. I will train, and I will represent the family. You can count on me.\u201d\n\u201cAlways knew I could, buddy,\u201d Bruce says, allowing himself to smile, just a little, as Damian slips out of a chair and leaves. But the battle is not yet won. He\u2019s got one down, three to go. \n\u201cWhat about Red Hood and Nightwing?\u201d Tim asks, as the door falls shut behind Damian. \u201cYou haven\u2019t mentioned them.\u201d\nBruce makes himself shrug, trying to appear casual. \u201cThey\u2019re adults. I meant what I said earlier. I can\u2019t tell you guys what to do, Jason and Dick least of all. I respect that.\u201d\n\u201cYou really mean that, don\u2019t you,\u201d Dick says. \u201cThat you can\u2019t tell us what to do. That you\u2019ll accept whatever we choose.\u201d\n\u201cI really mean that,\u201d Bruce confirms. For some reason, this makes his son deflate. \u201cDick? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nDick smiles ruefully. \u201cWhen I was fired as Robin, I left. Bruce never called me even once. It\u2019s like once he took away the cape, he was done with me, too. Like the cape was all that mattered.\u201d \n\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d Tim says, even though he sounds unsure himself. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t- he really didn\u2019t call?\u201d\n\u201cNot once.\u201d\nTim is chewing on his lip, a nervous habit that Bruce has never seen on him before today. \u201cHe must have been busy,\u201d he says. \u201cLike- maybe he was working really hard, and it all got too much, and he just forgot. Parents do that sometimes.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Dick agrees. \nBruce surprises himself by how forceful his \u201cNo\u201d is. He hadn\u2019t meant it to come out like that, but- \u201cParents do not forget to call. Not good parents, anyway.\u201d He thinks of Dick, moving out and waiting for a call that never came, and then he thinks of Timothy Drake, not the one sitting opposite him at the ridiculously large dining table, but the one from his own universe, the quiet, well-mannered child he\u2019s seen at galas sometimes, never making trouble for his parents and being scolded anyway. His heart aches not just for Dick and Tim, suddenly, but for that other Tim, too. For one brief, insane second, he wonders if it would be possible to return to his timeline just to collect that Tim, and then return to this one. \n\u201cI\u2019m going after Jason,\u201d Dick says suddenly, standing up with enough force that the table shakes. \u201cHe needs me.\u201d He looks at Bruce with his jaw clenched, like he\u2019s daring him to disagree. \nBruce isn\u2019t going to. \u201cGo. I trust your judgement on this.\u201d \n\u201cOh.\u201d Dick blinks. \u201cOkay. Bruce?\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019ll talk to him, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to stop being Red Hood. I won\u2019t convince him otherwise. It's his choice.\u201d \n\u201cOf course,\u201d Bruce agrees readily. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have expected anything less from you. You\u2019re a good brother, Dick.\u201d\nDick blinks again, more rapidly this time, eyes suspiciously wet. He nods, and with that, he\u2019s gone.\nTim is the only one left now. He is, as always, sitting ramrod straight, and he\u2019s steepled his fingers in front of his chin, solemnly gazing at Bruce. It makes him look like a tiny adult, which in turn almost makes Bruce smile, at least until he remembers that two weeks ago, Tim was CEO of a company. No doubt that in Tim\u2019s mind, he is an adult. This won\u2019t make the following conversation any easier.\n\u201cTim-\u201c\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to bother. I\u2019ll stop being Red Robin.\u201d Tim gives him a sincere-looking smile. \nAt the sight of that smile, Bruce\u2019s heart stops for a beat. \nNot noticing this, but picking up on his silence, Tim adds, his voice dripping with reassurance, \u201cYou\u2019ve made some good points. I know you\u2019re just worried about us. You convinced Damian, but Jason and Dick are in too deep, so there\u2019s no chance with these two. But you don\u2019t have to worry about me, because I\u2019ll stop. It\u2019s no problem.\u201d\n\u201cSo,\u201d Bruce says, once his heart has picked up its rhythm again and Tim\u2019s smile begins to falter in the wake of Bruce\u2019s unresponsiveness, \u201cyou just lied to my face several times, and I would like to know why.\u201d\nIf he hadn\u2019t been looking out for it, Bruce would have missed the split-second freeze before Tim\u2019s mask is back in place. \u201cLie?\u201d he repeats, still in that weird voice. \u201cI didn\u2019t lie. But I understand that we are, if you think about, complete strangers, so you might not trust me yet. That\u2019s okay. I will work hard to-\u201c\n\u201cStop it,\u201d Bruce says. \u201cThis routine might have worked on Batman, but I\u2019m not a moron. So you get a choice. You either tell me the truth, or I\u2019m going to handcuff myself to you to physically stop you from leaving this house without a chaperon. What\u2019s it going to be?\u201d\nTim narrows his eyes. \u201cI know how to pick locks.\u201d\nBruce nearly sighs with relief. Defiant is good. Defiant is miles better than the smiling stranger Tim just turned into. \u201cWell, you may know how to pick locks, but I\u2019m bigger and faster than you. You run, I\u2019ll catch you.\u201d\nThey\u2019re caught at a standstill, each eying the other with suspicion, trying to guess at a bluff. But Bruce isn\u2019t bluffing, and so eventually, Tim looks down. \u201cMy entire life,\u201d he says, \u201chas revolved around Batman. I was obsessed with Batman and Robin when I was a kid \u2013 I used to follow them around at night, taking photos, and sometimes, I used to sneak onto the grounds of Wayne Manor and look through the windows, just trying to catch a glimpse of them eating dinner or watching a movie. I never wanted to become Robin, it wasn\u2019t like that. I just wanted- I just liked the idea of it. Of being a family. \u2013 Don\u2019t say it,\u201d Tim says, catching Bruce opening his mouth. \u201cI know what you\u2019re going to say, and you\u2019re wrong. You don\u2019t know this, but some time ago, my dad found out about the whole vigilante thing, and told me to give it up. I did, and it was the most miserable time of my life. And now that my dad is dead \u2013 if I give up Red Robin, what then? What do I have left? All my friends are superheroes, and apparently when Dick left, you didn\u2019t even call, and I know I\u2019m back at school but I have no interest in going to college, and I don\u2019t- I can\u2019t- I\u2019m not ready to leave this yet. I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m just not.\u201d \n\u201cAre you done?\u201d Bruce asks and, when Tim nods, he puts his hands on his shoulders. His hands are big, and Tim is so small, and he kind of feels like one wrong move could crush him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t want me to say it, but I\u2019m going to say it anyway, because you need to hear it. You do have family. Your family is right here at the manor. And I can promise you that no matter where you are, no matter what you decide to do with your life, as long as you\u2019re more than ten miles away, I\u2019m going to call. If you don\u2019t believe me, just ask Jason.\u201d\nTim lets out a small, shaky laugh. \u201cI don\u2019t need to. He complained about it on the way here. Every day, really?\u201d\n\u201cThere you go, then.\u201d Bruce allows himself a smile. \u201cEvery day. I\u2019ll do it more often if you like. Twice a day. I can call you during work hours, too, every time I step out for a cigarette.\u201d\n\u201cBut \u2013 you don\u2019t smoke.\u201d\n\u201cNo, but my employees don\u2019t know that. I\u2019ll tell them I\u2019m a chain smoker and call you every hour.\u201d\nTim laughs again, and really, that\u2019s all Bruce ever wanted. To make his children happy. \u201cI appreciate it,\u201d Tim says. \u201cI really do. But-\u201c\n\u201cBut your argument still stands. Okay. Let me present you with another reason then: Damian.\u201d\nTim cocks his head. \u201cDamian?\u201d\n\u201cHe just agreed not to put on a cape until he\u2019s eighteen. If the same rules don\u2019t apply to you, too, he\u2019s going to find that very unfair indeed. Besides, big brothers should lead by example, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\u201cI want you to know that I realise what you\u2019re doing,\u201d Tim announces. \u201cThis is textbook manipulation.\u201d\n\u201cWell? Is it working?\u201d\n\u201cA little,\u201d Tim admits. \u201cFine. I turn eighteen next summer. That\u2019s only one more year.\u201d\nBruce is overwhelmed by the sudden urge to ruffle Tim\u2019s hair. He does, and Tim doesn\u2019t even look annoyed, just blinks slowly, like he doesn\u2019t quite understand what\u2019s happening. \u201cThank you, son. A very mature choice to make.\u201d\nThey\u2019re already on their way out when Tim asks, \u201cWait, does this mean I can\u2019t help out the Teen Titans anymore, either?\u201d\nThe what?\n*\nIt's a quarter to seven, which means Conner and Bart are supposed to arrive in exactly fifteen minutes. Tim\u2019s palms are sweaty. He wipes them on his jeans, to no avail. \nThe only good thing, he reflects, is that when Damian heard Tim is having friends over, he decided not to be outdone and announced the next day that he\u2019d also be spending the evening at a friend\u2019s place, which means he, at least, won\u2019t be here tonight. For someone who has never expressed an interest in making friends thus far, Damian sure moves quickly. Tim is a little impressed. Bruce, naturally, was thrilled, either not realising that his youngest son has turned befriending people into a competition, or not caring. \nWhat Damian had not known at the time is that of course, Tim had not invited Conner and Bart willingly. He\u2019s not that insane. Even if the old Bruce hadn\u2019t been ridiculously paranoid over having strangers in the house, Tim still would have preferred to keep his friends as far away from his family as possible, and now more than ever. Jason is home much more frequently than he used to, and Dick must have lied to his workplace about being on parent leave or something, since he\u2019s always here. It doesn\u2019t matter that they\u2019re both clearly upset about the No Cape suggestion. They still keep drifting into Bruce\u2019s general vicinity every day, like they can\u2019t help it. It\u2019s a little pathetic, to be honest, but Tim gets it. Bruce keeps ruffling his hair for some reason, and it\u2019s somehow the nicest thing Tim has ever felt. Crazy. \nBruce also ruffled his hair after finding out about the Teen Titans. He\u2019d gotten all weird and quiet for a few seconds, but in the end, he\u2019d just made a humming noise before asking Tim if he would like to invite any of his little friends over for dinner. Tim, thinking fast, had announced that they\u2019re all suffering a bout of bubonic plague and can\u2019t leave the house right now, or in the foreseeable future. \n\u201cThe bubonic plague has been eradicated,\u201d Bruce had said.\n\u201cNot in this universe,\u201d Tim had replied. Unfortunately, mysteriously, Bruce seems to be able to tell whenever Tim is lying to him, so he\u2019d called bullshit and told Tim that of course he doesn\u2019t have to invite anyone if he doesn\u2019t feel comfortable with it, but that Bruce would love to get to know this part of his life, too. What was Tim going to do? Tell him no? \n\u201cAre you brooding?\u201d Jason asks, stepping out from the shadows of the drawing room Tim had been using for his freak-out. \n\u201cJesus,\u201d Tim says, waiting for his heartbeat to slow down. \u201cHow long were you standing there?\u201d\n\u201cLike, ten seconds? I\u2019m sneaking back in because this is the only room that\u2019s got a fire escape, and I wanted a quick smoke. Why, how long were you in here?\u201d\n\u201cNot long,\u201d Tim says quickly, and Jason snorts.\n\u201cListen, Replacement, before you feel too sorry for yourself, keep in mind that Bruce asked me to bring over my friends, next. I didn\u2019t know how to explain to him that most of my friends are criminals.\u201d \n\u201cAre you guys brooding?\u201d Dick asks, entering through the window. \u201cWhy are the lights off?\u201d\n\u201cTim is having a fit of teenage angst,\u201d Jason says. That traitor. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to tell him that he\u2019s got nothing to be worried about. Bruce is literally the nicest guy I\u2019ve ever met. He\u2019s so nice it freaks me out a little. There is no way tonight can go wrong. Although-\u201c\nTim doesn\u2019t stick around to find out what Jason is going to say. He slams the door, then slams it again for good measure, then silently apologises to Alfred, and he\u2019s only taken two steps into the hallway when he runs into Bruce. Literally. \n\u201cSorry, chum,\u201d Bruce says, holding out a hand to help Tim up. \u201cDidn\u2019t see you there. I just need to- give me one second.\u201d Bruce finishes typing something on his phone, smiles briefly, before putting it away and giving Tim his full attention. \u201cI was just on my way downstairs. Have you seen your brothers?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Tim says, at the same time that someone slams against the door of the room he just exited. They must\u2019ve figured out that he removed the doorhandle. \u201cI\u2019ve no idea where they are.\u201d\nBruce\u2019s sigh is drowned out by the doorbell ringing. \u201cTeamwork. Would you like to free your brothers or go greet your guests?\u201d\n\u201cNo need to free them,\u201d Tim calls out, already on the stairs, \u201cI\u2019ve been reliably informed that there\u2019s a fire escape.\u201d \nWhen he arrives in the entry hall, Alfred walks past him with a leather jacket and Conner, now only dressed in a t-shirt, is visibly fidgeting. He is also alone.\u00a0 Why is he alone? \n\u201cWhy are you alone?\u201d Tim demands. \nConner scowls. \u201cBart was here when we arrived thirty seconds ago. He left to \u2018take care of something\u2019. Said to get started without him.\u201d \n\u201cAre they here?\u201d Bruce asks, joining them. \u201cTim, did you tell them that- oh.\u201d Bruce stops in his tracks when he sees Conner and, presumably, nobody else. He gets a weird, constipated look on his face. \n\u201cI invited more people,\u201d Tim says, feeling oddly defensive. \u201cBut Cassie is busy and Bart apparently just ditched us.\u201d He stops just short of insisting that he swears he has more than one friend, because that would perhaps be a little too pathetic. \n\u201cSir.\u201d Conner sticks out his hand. Before inviting them, Tim gave all his friends a quick summary of the situation, aka, told them that Batman got replaced with a nicer and capeless version of himself, that he really wants to parent Tim, and that he forced Tim into this dinner with a mixture of kindness and guilt. Bart thought this was hilarious, but Conner had seemed thoughtful. Probably he\u2019s thinking how to replace Superman, Tim thinks a little spitefully. \nBruce shakes his hand easily and invites them into the dining room, where Alfred has put the pizza they ordered half an hour ago. This was a fascinating fight to witness: Alfred had insisted on cooking, whereas Bruce had insisted that growing boys would prefer pizza to a five-course meal. When Alfred had then insisted on making the pizza from scratch, Bruce had said, \u201cIt\u2019s about the principle of it, Alfred. Trust me.\u201d As a result, Alfred has the evening off, effective immediately as soon as the guests arrive, and Bruce, who always acts a little weird when Alfred is around, had been a mixture of happy and guilty. \nAs he\u2019s just about to walk through the door, Jason, having apparently freed himself from his interim prison, pounces on him, or at least he tries to. Tim likes to think that he would have moved out of the way with ease and grace, but he doesn\u2019t get the chance, because Conner, too quick for the human eye to notice, is suddenly there, acting as a human or, well, alien shield between Tim and his murderous brother. \n\u201cLet me through,\u201d Jason snarls. \u201cSomeone is begging to get a good beating.\u201d\n\u201cStop,\u201d Conner says, and, miraculously, Jason stops. It takes Tim a second to realise that this is because Conner has a tight grip on his wrist. He can almost hear the bones grinding, ready to break. \n\u201cBoys,\u201d Bruce says loudly. \u201cStop squabbling. You can apologise to each other later. Jason, where\u2019s Dick?\u201d\n\u201cHere,\u201d Dick says, a bit sheepish as he comes in after them and flops down on a seat next to Bruce. \u201cSorry I\u2019m late.\u201d\n\u201cI locked him in the room again,\u201d Jason announces. Bruce invitingly pats the chair on his other side. He scowls and sits down next to Dick. \nTim takes the chair that Jason scorned, if only so that Conner can\u2019t. Not that it helps any. Bruce is still staring at Conner for some reason, and the staring has only increased over the course of the past sixty seconds. \nConner, clearly uncomfortable, waits until Bruce is occupied by asking Dick if he wants to help him build a treehouse tomorrow, before leaning in and saying quietly, right by Tim\u2019s ear, so that only Tim can hear him: \u201cDo I have something on my face?\u201d\n\u201cI think he\u2019s just happy I have a friend,\u201d Tim says insincerely. \u201cDon\u2019t mind him.\u201d \nBut it\u2019s hard not to. Bruce\u2019s eyes seem to track every one of Conner\u2019s movements. \nIt's when Tim\u2019s arm brushes against Conner\u2019s by accident that he suddenly realises what\u2019s happening \u2013 or, apparently, what Bruce thinks is happening. \nIn Bruce\u2019s defence, it\u2019s not that crazy an assumption. Tim knows a lot of people have remarked on how close Red Robin and Superboy are. A little too close, some would say \u2013 some have said. They\u2019re wrong, of course. He and Conner are friends, nothing more. But does it really matter if Bruce clearly thinks otherwise? \n\u201cSo, Conner,\u201d Bruce says, and both Tim and Conner startle a little because this is the first time Bruce has directly addressed him. \u201cDoes your \u2013 do your parents know about this side of your life?\u201d\nConner stiffens, presumably because he has no parents, and Tim also stiffens, because what the hell. \n\u201cWhat the hell, B,\u201d Jason says, for once having Tim\u2019s back. \n\u201cJason, eat your greens,\u201d Bruce says without glancing over at him. Jason, who has piled several pieces of bacon and sausage pizza on top of each other and who has absolutely zero greens, spitefully eats a piece of sausage. \n\u201cI don\u2019t have much contact with my family, sir,\u201d Conner answers diplomatically. Tim is impressed. Conner must really be trying hard to be nice to this alternate universe version of Bruce. \nBruce frowns harder. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that. Family is important, and boys like you \u2013 well, or Tim, I suppose \u2013 need a strong role model to show them what really matters in life. It\u2019s easy to enter the wrong path at your age.\u201d\nConner stiffens again, and this time Tim knows it\u2019s because he\u2019s heard Tim\u2019s heartbeat speed up. He tries to take in slow, measured breaths, but it\u2019s not really working. Wrong path, Bruce said. Is that what he thinks? That this is wrong? He wouldn\u2019t be the first in Tim\u2019s life to say so. But-\nBut Tim had kind of assumed Bruce would be different. \nDick, picking up on the tension but misreading it with the earnestness of someone who has never doubted their sexuality even once, says, \u201cStop intimidating Conner, Bruce. It\u2019s weird.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not intimidated,\u201d Conner says immediately. \u201cSir.\u201d \nJason, also picking up on the tension and reading it correctly, announces to the room at large: \u201cI\u2019ve sucked dick.\u201d\nDick looks disgusted, but that might be more because of Jason\u2019s unfortunate phrasing. Tim is more concerned with Bruce\u2019s reaction. Bruce looks \u2013 well. \nA bit confused, a bit worried, but mostly encouraging. \u201cExploring and embracing one\u2019s sexuality is important,\u201d he says. \u201cBut-\u201c\n\u201cBut don\u2019t do it in public?\u201d Jason interrupts. His eyes have that murderous glint again. Conner shifts in his seat. \u201cBut don\u2019t talk about it?\u201d\n\u201cBut please do it safely,\u201d Bruce says. \n\u201cI\u2019ve sucked dick, too,\u201d Dick says suddenly. They all turn to look at him, and he shrugs. \u201cWhat? Jason doesn\u2019t have a monopoly on being gay.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not gay,\u201d Tim says, feeling a headache forming behind his eyes. \n\u201cI\u2019m not gay, either,\u201d Jason says. \u201cWhat, does sucking dick make you gay now? That\u2019s homophobic.\u201d\n\u201cIt is a little bit,\u201d Dick agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s not always about sex, Tim.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, Tim,\u201d Jason says, \u201cGod. Get it together.\u201d\nBruce appears to be getting a headache too, judging from the way he pinches his nose. \u201cEveryone out.\u201d\nSilence. \n\u201cWhat?\u201d Jason asks with uncharacteristic uncertainty. \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d\n\u201cLeave. Go find us some dessert and pick a movie to watch. And find me some aspirin while you\u2019re at it. \u2013 Hold on. Not you two.\u201d Bruce points first at Tim and then at Conner. They both freeze. \u201cAlright,\u201d Bruce says when Dick has dragged a protesting Jason out of the room, \u201cyou\u2019re going to be explaining some things.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t kick me out,\u201d Tim blurts out. Next to him, Conner goes rigid, inching his chair a little closer like he\u2019s ready to jump into action. \u201cWe aren\u2019t even dating, and apparently I\u2019m the only one of your sons who hasn\u2019t sucked dick yet, so it would be really unfair of you to do this when I\u2019m not even acting gay.\u201d\n\u201cIf you do kick him out,\u201d Conner adds, voice low and threatening, \u201cyou will go up against the Teen Titans, and you will lose.\u201d\nBruce sighs. \u201cNobody is getting kicked out. That\u2019s not what\u2019s happening here.\u201d\nTim hesitates. \u201cI really am gay, though,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m just not acting on it. I just want you to know all the facts before making any final decisions.\u201d\n\u201cThere are no facts that could make me kick you out,\u201d Bruce says, and for a minute there, he almost sounds like Batman with how certain he is, how clear his voice rings out into the room, like the world will revolve around his words just because they\u2019re his words. \u201cNot a single thing will make me change my mind about you.\nThat\u2019s my decision.\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019re not \u2013 mad?\u201d\n\u201cTim.\u201d Bruce reaches out across the table, and Tim reluctantly places his hand in Bruce\u2019s. The warm skin contact actually makes him feel a bit calmer. \u201cIt\u2019s your choice how to spend your life, how much or little you want to explore your sexuality. I said this to Jason earlier, and I\u2019ll say it again to you, as often as you need to hear it. I just need you to know that I will never be mad because you\u2019re gay.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Tim says, feeling weirdly exhausted by this conversation, like he has run a marathon, or like he\u2019s gotten kidnapped again and had to free himself because Batman called it good practice. \u201cThat\u2019s- wait. So why were you glaring at Conner?\u201d\nTo his surprise, it\u2019s Conner who speaks up. \u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019m a clone.\u201d\nBruce\u2019s smile fades away into a frown, and Tim feels himself freeze again, an instinctive reaction to seeing Batman be visibly unhappy with him. Maybe some day, he will be able to train himself out of this. \u201cYou\u2019re a clone? Your universe clones people?\u201d\n\u201cYour universe doesn\u2019t?\u201d\n\u201cI think my universe stopped at cloning sheep,\u201d Bruce says, tapping his lip thoughtfully. \u201cSo you\u2019re Superman\u2019s clone. Alright. Do you live with him?\u201d\n\u201cConner lives at Titans Tower,\u201d Tim interrupts, eager to contribute to the conversation and especially eager to talk about how Superman has, honestly, been kind of a dick to Conner. \u201cSuperman doesn\u2019t talk to him.\u201d\nConner kicks Tim under the table, but he does it gently, because Tim\u2019s leg doesn\u2019t break. \u201cI share DNA with Superman and Lex Luthor,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt has been hard for him to interact with me without seeing his archnemesis.\u201d\n\u201cHis archnemesis? Superman has an archnemesis? Do I have an archnemesis? Wait, do you kids have an archnemesis?\u201d\n\u201cEvil,\u201d Conner says at the same time that Tim says, \u201cJason\u201d and, considering for a second: \u201cShellfish.\u201d\n\u201cBut,\u201d Bruce says, getting back on track, \u201cin that case, who pays for your education?\u201d\n\u201cI have an eidetic memory,\u201d Conner says. \u201cI don\u2019t need education.\u201d\n\u201cI basically have an eidetic memory too,\u201d Tim says quickly. \u201cRight, Conner?\u201d \n\u201cHm,\u201d Conner says doubtfully. \nMomentarily distracted, Bruce says, \u201cTim, you\u2019re failing physics.\u201d\n\u201cBecause I fall asleep in class, not because I can\u2019t do the tasks.\u201d\n\u201cDo you need help with physics?\u201d Conner asks, concerned. \u201cI can help.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t need help, I need- Bruce? What are you doing?\u201d\nBruce is on his phone again. His fingers are so large that he keeps hitting the wrong keys, so typing always takes him ages. \u201cI\u2019m just checking something,\u201d he says. \u201cDon\u2019t mind me, I can multitask.\u201d\nBruce really can\u2019t. One time, Tim saw him trying to fry an egg while making tea, and he somehow managed to burn both. Another time, just the other day, he promised to give Tim a lift to school, and he did, but they were also halfway to Metropolis before Bruce realised that Tim had been strategically asking questions to distract him from taking the correct turn or reading the road signs.\n\u201cI just need to- here we go. All done.\u201d \n\u201cDone what?\u201d Tim asks, and Bruce smiles sunnily. \n\u201cJust rearranged Wayne Enterprise\u2019s financing a little. I also got you a physics tutor. And I texted Alfred to never serve shellfish, ever.\u201d\nBefore Tim can reply, there is a knock at the front door. It shouldn\u2019t be audible from the dining room, but it is, because it sounded like someone took a sledgehammer to it. Is Wayne Manor under attack, or is Jason acting out? Could be either, could be both. \n\u201cStay here,\u201d Bruce commands, and leaves.\nConner and Tim exchange a glance and follow him. They come running into the foyer at the same time as Bruce, just in time to see the massive oak door vibrate again and then splitter as someone punches a hole through it. \nIt's Superman.\n*\nMany things are different in this universe, but even more things are the same. Bruce still lives in Gotham, for example, and for another instance, Gotham is still objectively a place nobody should live in. There are many similarities.\nAnother similarity is that both universes have a Clark Kent. Only Bruce\u2019s Clark Kent does not, to his knowledge, fly around in a cape. \nBruce is one hundred per cent sure that he is not supposed to know Superman\u2019s secret identity. All his children are hyper-aware of his ignorance regarding this world\u2019s superheroes, and all the files on the Batcomputer are password-protected. \nLuckily, once he figured out his phone\u2019s password, he was able to figure out all the other ones, too. \nSo Bruce has done a little reading. Well, a lot of reading. It\u2019s not stalking if he\u2019s stalking himself, he reasons, and it\u2019s also not stalking if he\u2019s stalking his children. He\u2019s already befriended all of them on Instagram, it\u2019s not like he doesn\u2019t see what they\u2019re up to anyway. \nIt's especially not stalking, he has decided, if he\u2019s stalking potential threats to his family. \nThe Justice League made number one of that list. \nBruce is not sure why he\u2019s still funding them, exactly. But he would have been willing to let it slide, perhaps. He has a lot of money, after all. \nWould have been willing. \nUntil he found out about the Teen Titans. \nKnowing that some version of himself, however twisted that version might be, turned all his children into vigilantes is bad enough, but at least in this case he quite literally only has himself to be angry with. But the Teen Titans are a colossal screw-up that has multiple adults not just involved, but directly responsible, and it seems that so far, nobody has done anything about it. The Justice League encouraged it, even. \nWhich is why earlier this evening, he sent out an email announcing that he\u2019s cutting all funding for the League, effective immediately, and putting the money into a trust fund for all the Teen Titans instead. \nThis was Bruce being nice. It was Bruce knowing about the Teen Titans as a general concept, from the files on the Batcomputer, from the internet, and from Tim. But his research had been mostly focused on the Justice League. He hadn\u2019t really paid attention to this other team, besides knowing that they\u2019re all child soldiers supported by a bunch of people in their thirties and forties.\nThen he found out that not only is Clark Kent\u2019s son part of that team, but he also doesn\u2019t have the grace to at least talk to said son. \nSo Bruce stopped being nice. \nIn his second email, he pleasantly informed the League that he\u2019s calling CPS on them.\nJudging by the fist-shaped hole in his door, he assumes that Superman checked his email. \nSuperman steps through the destroyed door \u2013 literally steps through it, and destroys it more in the process. He looks weird without his glasses. \n\u201cRed Robin, Superboy,\u201d he snaps, \u201cget away from him. He might be mind-controlled.\u201d\n\u201cWe went over this,\u201d Tim says, sounding long-suffering. \u201cHe\u2019s not. Trust me, we checked.\u201d\n\u201cA clone, then,\u201d Superman says, disdain dripping from every word. From the periphery of his vision, Bruce can see Conner flinching. \n\u201cActually,\u201d Bruce says, taking a step forward and subtly angling his body so that he\u2019s standing in front of the boys, shielding them, \u201cI\u2019m not a clone, either. I\u2019m just a good father.\u201d\n\u201cA good-\u201c Superman stops, considering. \u201cAmnesia?\u201d he guesses. \n\u201cAlternate universe,\u201d Tim corrects. \u201cI\u2019m working on it.\u201d\n\u201cWork harder,\u201d Superman says, and this time Tim is the one who flinches. \u201cWe\u2019ve all seen the headlines, even before those ridiculous emails. Gotham needs Batman.\u201d\n\u201cThe Justice League needs my money, you mean.\u201d Bruce\u2019s smile is sharp and unpleasant. \u201cBut that\u2019s not happening any longer. Now get out of my house before I call the police.\u201d\nSuperman shakes his head in disbelief. \u201cThe police. That other universe really must be something. Fine. Superboy, you stay here and keep an eye on things. Red Robin, you\u2019re with me.\u201d\nBruce makes sure to keep Tim behind him, ready to tell Superman that he wasn\u2019t kidding about calling the cops, but Tim speaks up first. \n\u201cDo I have to?\u201d he asks. \n\u201cNo,\u201d Bruce says immediately. \n\u201cYes,\u201d Superman says, incredulous. \u201cI wasn\u2019t asking. You will report your progress on solving this issue to the League. You should have alerted us as soon as the situation arose, but it\u2019s too late now. Batman can discipline you when he gets back.\u201d\n\u201cNo offence,\u201d Tim says, \u201cbut I don\u2019t really see what you can do to help. When Batman got stuck in the timestream, I wasn\u2019t getting any help from your corner, either. I think I\u2019ll take my chances.\u201d\n\u201cBruce,\u201d Superman says, having apparently decided to stop bothering with Tim and instead looking straight at him, \u201cI understand that you are new to this world. But no matter what these two-\u201c He nods towards Tim and Conner. \u201c-have told you, you are still a version of the world\u2019s greatest detective. Don\u2019t believe what anyone tells you. Try and see the facts.\u201d\n\u201cThe facts are perfectly clear,\u201d Bruce says. \u201cThe facts are that if you don\u2019t leave right this second, I\u2019m going to the press and I\u2019ll reveal more than just my secret love of baked goods, Clark.\u201d \nSuperman goes pale. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cIf my identity gets revealed, so does yours. You\u2019re bluffing.\u201d\n\u201cI might be,\u201d Bruce agrees. \u201cBut can you really afford to stick around and find out for sure?\u201d\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t over,\u201d Superman snaps, but it is. It really is. \nBruce exhales deeply once Superman is gone again. He will have to fix the door before Alfred gets back. But first, he needs to talk to Tim and Conner and, eventually, to Dick and Jason, too. He needs to-\n\u201cWow,\u201d says someone, a teenager who was definitely not in the foyer two seconds ago, \u201cI got distracted somewhere in East Asia and completely lost track of time. Seems like I missed a lot. Did I just run past Superman outside?\u201d \nTim says, \u201cI told you I invited more people.\u201d\n*\nThe Tim Drake of this universe has failed Batman. He\u2019s weak. He hasn\u2019t suffered like the other one has. It makes him useless for Batman\u2019s purpose. \nHe has not even attempted to track down this universe\u2019s Dick Grayson or Jason Todd. They are of no use to him as civilians. \nSo instead, Batman is holed up in the manor, and he waits. He waits for Red Robin to hurry up. As soon as he\u2019s back, they can have a conversation about what timing is and is not acceptable for a rescue mission.\nAs soon as he\u2019s back.\nJason has moved back into the manor. He claims he did it to make sure Bruce doesn\u2019t give his room to yet another child \u2013 there is one more now than there was a week ago, and at this rate, they\u2019ll have run out of rooms by Christmas \u2013 but really, he doesn\u2019t much care if Tim\u2019s boyfriend lives with them now or if Bruce wants to adopt a million more kids. \nIf he\u2019s completely honest with himself, he moved back in because he likes being around this Bruce. \nThis Bruce has not given him any indication that he cares about anything more than his children. And the thing is- the thing is that, look, Jason is aware that this Bruce is no vigilante, that he\u2019s never fought crime on Gotham\u2019s streets at night, and that he doesn\u2019t really know this life. But he still feels like if he got killed by a clinically insane clown again, this Bruce would stop at nothing to avenge him. \nThey\u2019re not completely different, this Bruce and the Bruce Jason grew up with. But this Bruce keeps his darkness contained, letting it out in only very specific situations, like when someone is threatening his kids. \nJason can take care of himself, but he still likes knowing that if he was beaten to death with a pipe for a second time, his new dad would at the very least invite his siblings to the funeral. \nMoving back in has come at a cost, though. Namely, he has to deal with being the only one of his family who is not wilfully blind to that the Replacement is clearly up to something. Some days, Jason thinks he\u2019s going crazy with how obvious it is. How can nobody notice? \n\u201cHe literally excused himself from dinner yesterday to work on a project,\u201d he tells Dick at breakfast, eyes wild. \nDick has not moved back in, Jason knows. What he does not know is why, then, he is somehow still always here. \n\u201cI think it\u2019s great that he\u2019s taking school more seriously,\u201d Dick tells him blithely. \u201cHey, are you eating that?\u201d\n\u201cYeth,\u201d Jason says after shoving the entire waffle into his mouth at once to prevent his idiot brother from taking it. \n\u201cAnyway, I think you\u2019re being a little paranoid. Leave the kid alone. When I went to check on him yesterday, he was at his desk doing homework. What\u2019s your problem?\u201d \nMy problem, Jason thinks, is that Tim doesn\u2019t do homework. He hates school. Which Jason thinks is a bit rich of him, figuratively and literally, because going to school is a privilege that was ripped from Jason when he died at sixteen, and the least Tim could do is to show up to his English Lit class on time. But he doesn\u2019t say any of that, partly because he\u2019s aware that he sounds like jealous and spiteful, and partly because the Replacement has just entered the dining room, followed by Superboy, who holds himself like a bodyguard. Well, like Tim\u2019s bodyguard. \n\u201cTim,\u201d Dick says happily, \u201ccome sit with us.\u201d\n\u201cNo time,\u201d Tim says, \u201cI\u2019m kind of in the middle of something.\u201d He makes a beeline for the plate with waffles that Alfred has deposited on the table earlier, frowning when Jason pulls it out of his reach. \n\u201cIn the middle of what?\u201d he demands. \n\u201cDecapitating someone and putting their head in a duffle bag,\u201d Tim says. \u201cOh, wait, that\u2019s you. Give me a waffle.\u201d\n\u201cNot until you tell me what you\u2019re up to, holed up in that room all the time.\u201d\n\u201cHomework,\u201d Tim says, obviously lying. \nDick has never looked more smug. See, his face seems to say, see, didn\u2019t I tell you? But that\u2019s why Dick is the one who got his tongue stuck to a pole one time, and yes, Jason also got his tongue stuck to a pole, but he did it on a dare. Dick did it to see what happens. There\u2019s a difference. \n\u201cYou\u2019re not getting food until you cut the crap,\u201d Jason says, then curses suddenly and violently when Conner twists his arm to take the plate away and hold it out to Tim. Tim selects a waffle and nods at his boyfriend, who returns the plate to the table and follows Tim out of the room, throwing them all a suspicious look. \n\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Tim says, voice muffled, just before he rounds the corner, \u201cif I can get the others off my back for a little longer, I can finish this by the end of the week.\u201d\n\u201cDid you hear that,\u201d Jason hisses.\n\u201cI heard you harassing your little brother,\u201d Dick says primly, and refuses to talk any longer about Jason\u2019s completely valid concerns. \nBut Tim is up to something. Jason knows he is. And he\u2019s going to get to the bottom of it if it kills him (again).\n*\n\u201cPass the remote, Replacement.\u201d\n\u201cIf you call me Replacement one more time-\u201c\n\u201cTimothy, if you pass the remote to me, I will reward you generously.\u201d\n\u201cTim. Timmy. Timtam. Give it to me. Give it to your favourite big brother. Come on.\u201d\n\u201cIt is my turn to pick the movie, and I am not going to let any of your vultures take that from me. Especially not since I was going to skip movie night in the first place, if you hadn\u2019t dragged me from my room.\u201d\n\u201cYes, because we all suspect you\u2019re building a bomb in there. What? Don\u2019t look at me like that, Dick, it's not harassment if it\u2019s true.\u201d\nBruce smiles to himself as he walks past the television room. His children are going to be arguing for a while longer, so there is plenty of time left before the movie starts.\nIn the kitchen, Alfred is making popcorn, though he turns at Bruce\u2019s approach. \u201cSir?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re still arguing.\u201d\n\u201cAh.\u201d Alfred returns to his task and Bruce, content to just watch for a while, sits down at the massive kitchen island and props his chin up on his folded hands. He feels like a teenager again, watching Alfred cook for him and having his offers of help firmly, but politely declined. The Alfred from his universe had never let him help, not once. Bruce hadn\u2019t known how to fry an egg until he was twenty-five.\nHe hadn\u2019t known how to cook anything until he was twenty-five. He\u2019d had to teach himself. \n\u201cAlfred,\u201d he says, and stops, unsure what to say. \nAlfred faces him again, his face kind. His wrinkles are deeper than Bruce remembers from his Alfred, but then again, the last time he saw Alfred was over twenty years ago. \n\u201cMaster Bruce?\u201d\nBruce shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s nothing. Please continue.\u201d\nAlfred does. The corn has started popping in the pan, an unrhythmic plop-plop-plop that sounds like it\u2019s hailing. Trusting that this spectacle is going to continue on for a while, Alfred turns to another pot, where he\u2019s been preparing hot chocolate. He stirs, each movement practiced and calm, and his voice is calm, too, when he asks, \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me asking \u2013 how did I die? In your universe?\u201d\nEvery muscle in Bruce\u2019s body tenses. But somehow, he can still speak, even though by all rights he should have been rendered mute by the question. \n\u201cAccident,\u201d he says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t anybody\u2019s fault. Just an unfortunate combination of circumstances.\u201d\n\u201cThat,\u201d Alfred says, \u201cis most often the case, I\u2019ve found.\u201d He stirs some more. The popcorn continues plop-plop-plopping. \n\u201cAlfred,\u201d Bruce starts again. \u201cI-\u201c He stops when Alfred sets down a steaming mug of hot chocolate in front of him. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d\n\u201cA cure for ailments of the heart.\u201d \nPlop-plop-plop.\n\u201cI miss you,\u201d Bruce says suddenly. \u201cYou\u2019re right in front of me, and I still miss you. Do you think that\u2019s odd, Alfred?\u201d\n\u201cWherever my counterpart is now,\u201d Alfred says, the wrinkles on his face deepening as he smiles wistfully, \u201cI\u2019m sure he misses you, too, sir.\u201d\n*\nTim is not, unlike what Jason seems to think, completely oblivious. He knows that for the past couple of weeks, Jason has been tailing him, stalking him, for lack of a better word, and the irony of it makes him laugh. Who would have thought, once upon a time, that their roles would end up being reversed? These days he can barely round a corner without running to Jason, who will stand there with his arms crossed and his eyes narrowed, and it would drive Tim crazy. He\u2019d surely assume that Jason is out to ruin his plans, not on purpose, but because Jason is, to be honest, the most unreliable and unstable person Tim knows. \nSo, yeah, Tim knows that Jason thinks he\u2019s up to something, and he\u2019d probably be worried about him ruining everything.\nIf it weren\u2019t for the fact that he has already finished the antidote last week. \nThe thing is that once you understand how the multiverse works, it\u2019s not that hard to figure out the rest. All he needed to do was to figure out the blueprints of a time machine, combine that with the blueprints of a submarine, then steal a probe of Bruce\u2019s blood, and then- \nIt doesn\u2019t matter. Tim figured it out, is the point, and it wasn\u2019t that hard, because he really was not lying to Bruce when he said that his issue with physics is not that he doesn\u2019t understand. So he built the machine, and the result of his efforts is a small vial with a clear fluid inside. Harmless to anybody who drinks it except people whose consciousness is stuck in another universe. Bruce can mix it in orange juice, tea, soup, or he can even just drink it undiluted. As soon as he finishes it, his consciousness will be swapped with Batman\u2019s consciousness, and everyone will be back in their original universe. \nThe vial has sat in the drawer of his desk, untouched, for several days now. \nHe hasn\u2019t told anyone about it, not even Conner. Conner knows what he was working on, but Tim hasn\u2019t told him that he\u2019s done. Conner assumes that Tim hit a snag, that he\u2019s been taking a break to figure out what the problem is, and Tim hasn\u2019t corrected him. Worse, he\u2019s told Bart to distract Conner by taking him on a Teen Titans mission. \nTim feels sort of bad about that. He knows that Bruce wishes all of them would quit, not just his own kids, but all of the Teen Titans, too. But he also knows that Conner and Bart aren\u2019t going to, and he suspects that Bruce, who told Conner that he\u2019s welcome in the manor every time and offered to sue Superman for paternity rights, knows it, too, even though he doesn\u2019t want to admit it. \nSo Conner has been gone from the manor for a few days, everyone else thinks he\u2019s working on a school project, and Jason thinks he\u2019s building nuclear weapons. \nTo distract himself, he goes on a rowing trip with his family. \nSummer vacation starts next week, and Bruce has been talking about going on a holiday, just them and Alfred, somewhere warm and sunny. \nIt\u2019s warm and sunny today, and it\u2019s even hotter in the car. They had to split into two groups, and Tim\u00a0 rides with Dick and Jason, and they fight over who gets to drive the entire time it takes them to get to the lake, getting lost two times in the process, and when they finally arrive, Bruce and Damian are already there, wearing lifejackets and setting up the two boats.\n\u201cDami and I were getting worried about you,\u201d Bruce says, eyes twinkling, as he hands them paddles. \u201cWe thought you had gotten lost.\u201d\n\u201cWe know you got lost,\u201d Damian corrects, \u201cbut Father told me to be nice about it. Timothy, I wish us to share a boat. You may try to regain your sense of navigation.\u201d\n\u201cOh, um, sure,\u201d Tim says, surprised. It doesn\u2019t take long for him to realise the reasoning behind Damian\u2019s suggestion. They\u2019ve been rowing for approximately five minutes when behind them, Dick and Jason\u2019s argument, continued on straight from the car, gets louder, drowning out Bruce\u2019s soothing rumble, and two minutes after that, there is a huge splash. \n\u201cShould we check on them?\u201d Tim asks. \n\u201cThey will be fine,\u201d Damian decides, and continues rowing. \nBruce, Dick and Jason\u2019s boat gets overturned three more times. After the second time, they lose one of the paddles. Bruce gives one of his to Jason, who promptly starts using it to start an impromptu sword fight with Dick. They all land in the water again, and lose two more paddles. Tim hasn\u2019t laughed this hard in a really long time. \nStill, it\u2019s nice. Bruce made them all put on sunscreen earlier, but it\u2019s still so hot that Tim\u2019s nose gets sunburned anyway, which he only realises when they take a picture together and he looks like a lobster on it. But that\u2019s okay, because Jason, Bruce and Dick all look like the thing from the lake, completely swamped. Only Damian looks okay in the photo. \nAfter the guy who rented the boats to them has finished scolding Bruce for losing so many paddles and not keeping his kids in check, they all go out for burgers. Just before entering the restaurant, Tim stops, falling to the back of the group and letting them enter before him. He doesn\u2019t follow them in. \nBruce, noticing, has let himself fall back, too, and now he gives Tim a quizzical look. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s up, champ? That sunburn bothering you?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Tim says, hands flying up to probe at his face automatically. He doesn\u2019t explain. \nBruce waits for a few seconds and then smiles. \u201cYour birthday is coming up,\u201d he says. \u201cTwo more weeks, right?\u201d\nTim has to think about it for a moment. \u201cYes,\u201d he says then. \u201cI think so.\u201d\nBruce laughs and reaches out to ruffle his hair. \u201cForgot about it, did you? Well, it\u2019s of no consequence. Seventeen is a big number. We\u2019ll have to do something nice. What did you do last year?\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Tim says, feeling supremely awkward, \u201cwell. I had a lot going on at the time, so it kind of slipped my mind. Bart and Conner planned this surprise party with all of the Teen Titans, but then we got this hologram message from the future, about how one family member would betray us all, so I spent like, the entire day dealing with that crisis.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Bruce echoes. \u201cThat sounds-\u201c\n\u201cAnd then,\u201d Tim says, on a roll now, \u201cafter, like, two days of fearing that one of the people I trust most in the world would poison us all in our sleep, it turned out that it was all a hoax. It was Batman\u2019s birthday gift to me.\u201d\n\u201cBatman\u2019s birthday gift to you was\u2026trust issues?\u201d\n\u201cHe said it was to test my detective skills,\u201d Tim says, and he\u2019s surprised by how bitter he sounds. He hadn\u2019t been this bitter at the time, he thinks. Just, well. He\u2019d been happy about that surprise party, back then, and he\u2019d maybe been a little upset that they had to cancel it all to investigate a case that turned out to be an elaborate prank. They didn\u2019t even get to eat the cake. \nBruce is silent for several seconds before slinging an arm around his shoulders and pulling him in tight as he steers them in the direction of the restaurant. \u201cLuckily, I love throwing birthday parties,\u201d he says. Tim knows that he is keeping his tone deliberately light, but he doesn\u2019t mind. \u201cDo you like ice cream cake? I always wanted ice cream cake when I was a kid. Alfred hated it.\u201d\n\u201cIce cream cake sounds nice,\u201d Tim offers politely. He doesn\u2019t particularly care for sweets, but it\u2019s not about that. It hadn\u2019t been about that at his last birthday either. \n\u201cAnd we\u2019ll have to get you a party hat,\u201d Bruce is continuing, \u201cand, hey, do you want a bouncy castle?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m turning seventeen, not seven,\u201d Tim reminds him. Bruce laughs and ruffles his hair again like Tim has said something hilarious, and Tim melts into the touch because he\u2019s weak like that. \n\u201cRight you are, buddy,\u201d he says. \u201cWell, is seventeen too old for gifts, too? I thought not,\u201d he says when Tim shakes his head. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\n\u201cA tattoo,\u201d Tim says promptly. \u201cAnd a gun.\u201d\nBruce laughs again, eyes sparkling with fondness, and he doesn\u2019t let go of Tim all the way until they are seated with the others. \nTim is going to really miss this.\n*\nThey\u2019ve developed a routine of sorts, during the first week of summer holidays. Bruce will wake up first, because he\u2019s always been an early riser. He will have an early breakfast with Alfred, then do his morning yoga in what he and his parents have always called the \u201cgarden\u201d even though it has approximately the size of a mid-sized town, and by the time he goes back inside, sweat dripping from his brow, Damian will be up, too. He will have a small second breakfast with his youngest son before driving him to the art class he\u2019s taking at a local community centre, and when he gets back from that, Dick and Jason will already be halfway through the first argument of the day. It\u2019s nice, sitting down at the kitchen island with a small third breakfast and letting their voices wash over him. \nFinally, Dick will leave to give Damian a ride home or, usually, get distracted on the way back and make a detour to go get ice cream together, and Jason will be off to his room, where he will blast music loud enough to be heard in every single room of the manor. \u201cIt\u2019s a phase,\u201d Bruce had told Alfred just yesterday. \u201cHe\u2019s testing me. He\u2019ll get over it.\u201d\n\u201cIf you say so, sir,\u201d Alfred had agreed, but he\u2019d sounded doubtful about it. \nAnd finally, awoken by the sound of persistent screaming (Jason\u2019s taste in music leaves much to be desired), Tim will wake up, stumble into the kitchen, and Bruce will have an even smaller fourth breakfast while his son works his way through two pots of coffee. \nIt's nice, all of it. Bruce likes having all his kids home. He\u2019ll take them all on a real vacation soon. To the beach, maybe. All children should spend time at the beach at least once a year. Skiing is nice, too, but that\u2019s more of a winter activity. He can still take them skiing for Christmas. Or maybe it\u2019s better to celebrate Christmas at home, and they can go over New Year\u2019s. He\u2019ll figure it out. \nThe music has started five minutes ago and, right on time, Tim arrives in the kitchen. Alfred sets down a plate with bacon and eggs in front of him, a smaller plate with cut-up fruit in front of Bruce, and pours Tim coffee and Bruce a glass of freshly pressed orange juice. \n\u201cTrade you a piece of mango for a piece of bacon,\u201d Bruce whispers conspiratorially as soon as Alfred\u2019s back is turned, holding out his fork. Tim allows him to steal some bacon and accepts a piece of pineapple in return, but his heart doesn\u2019t seem to be in it. Perhaps he didn\u2019t sleep well. \n\u201cAlfred,\u201d he says, \u201care you going grocery shopping today?\u201d\nAlfred puts the last plate in the dishwasher, turns it on and, as the faint rumbling starts, says, \u201cI\u2019m just about to leave, Master Bruce. Any special requests?\u201d\n\u201cChocolate,\u201d Bruce says. \u201cTim isn\u2019t feeling well. Chocolate will do the trick.\u201d\n\u201cWise words, sir,\u201d Alfred says, taking out the grocery list to write down chocolate. \u201cI do believe you missed your true calling as a doctor.\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m feeling fine,\u201d Tim says, once Alfred is gone. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do that.\u201d\n\u201cTechnically, Alfred is doing it,\u201d Bruce says. \u201cI\u2019m just paying the grocery bill. And the dentist bill later on.\u201d\nIt makes Tim smile, but weakly, like he\u2019s only going through the motions for Bruce\u2019s sake. \n\u201cIced tea,\u201d he decides. \u201cIt\u2019s too hot for anything else. None of that coffee nonsense today. And then we\u2019ll go do something fun afterwards. How do you feel about going to the pool?\u201d\nHe stands, rummaging around in the fridge in search of the iced tea he knows for a fact Alfred prepared earlier this morning. When he finally finds it, he pours a glass for Tim and puts a pink umbrella in it to lighten his mood. Tim smiles at it as Bruce presents it to him, but again, it seems pale. \n\u201cThanks,\u201d he says. \nBruce nods and eats more fruit and steals another piece of bacon. He\u2019ll need more protein if they really are going to the pool. He should text Dick, tell him to gather up Damian and meet them there. He can bring their swimming clothes. \n\u201cBruce,\u201d Tim says, just as Bruce lifts the glass of juice to his mouth. Bruce immediately sets it back down, concerned. \n\u201cYes?\u201d\nTim\u2019s eyes are glued to the glass. \u201cNothing,\u201d he says. \u201cSorry.\u201d\nBruce glances from the juice to the iced tea. \u201cWould you like to swap?\u201d he asks. \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t even ask if you wanted juice instead.\u201d\n\u201cIced tea is fine,\u201d Tim says, and quietly repeats, \u201cSorry.\u201d Bruce doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s sorry for, but he hesitates to ask. In his experience, it\u2019s not always good to push. Tim will come to him when he\u2019s ready. \nThey eat in silence for a while, Tim more solemn than usual, and Bruce worrying about Tim being worried. Maybe, he thinks, it\u2019s boy troubles. \u201cConner hasn\u2019t come to visit in a while,\u201d he says casually. \n\u201cHe\u2019s on a mission with Impul- with Bart.\u201d\n\u201cAre Conner and Bart close?\u201d Bruce asks, aiming for casual again. Judging by the look Tim gives him, he's not very successful at it.\n\u201cConner and Bart are friends. Conner and I are also friends.\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d Bruce says. \u201cYou should invite him over again. I meant it when I said Conner could stay with us any time.\u201d\nTim swallows audibly. \u201cI know,\u201d he says. \u201cI appreciate it.\u201d\n\u201cAny time, kiddo,\u201d Bruce says, and wonders why Tim looks so sad. He lifts his juice to his mouth to hide the downward tilt of his lips, not wanting to concern Tim. Tim has enough on his plate as it is without Bruce to-\n\u201cStop!\u201d\nBruce freezes. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\nTim has gone deathly pale. \u201cI need to tell you something.\u201d \nFinally, Bruce thinks. \n\u201cI\u2019m listening,\u201d he says. \u201cWhenever you\u2019re ready, buddy.\u201d To underline his words, he puts one supportive hand on Tim\u2019s bony shoulders. \nTim opens his mouth, but no sound comes out. He finally takes a sip of his iced tea, possibly to gather courage, possibly to stall. That\u2019s okay. Bruce can wait. He uses the brief respite to take a sip of orange juice, half-wondering if he should have made some iced tea for himself, too. \n\u201cI- did you drink that?\u201d Tim asks suddenly, eyes wide. \nBruce sets the glass down. It\u2019s still almost full, and at the sight of it, Tim slumps in relief. The words come rushing out of him now, tumbling over each other in haste. \u201cI figured it out,\u201d he says, \u201cbut then I wasn\u2019t sure, but then you kept talking about that vacation, and my birthday, and you were being so nice, and suddenly I felt really bad because I realised I was actually being so unfair to you, you have this entire life to get back to and here I am, tying you down with making me packed lunches and sending me to school, and I\u2019m just taking that choice away from you, I mean, you didn\u2019t have any kids in your world, there\u2019s probably a reason for that, right? So I- I just-\u201c\n\u201cBreathe,\u201d Bruce advises him. \u201cTake deep breaths, now.\u201d\nTim takes a deep breath and looks him dead in the eye. \u201cSo earlier when you weren\u2019t looking, I slipped something in your drink.\u201d\nAh, Bruce thinks. \nTim doesn\u2019t have to explain any further. Bruce can guess well enough. \nHe looks from Tim, to the glass of juice, and back to Tim. \u201cSo what now?\u201d he asks. Calm. He sounds calm. \nHe does not feel calm. \n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Tim says, sounding panicked. \u201cYou only took a sip of it, so it shouldn\u2019t \u2013 or maybe it\u2019s gone wrong. Maybe it never worked in the first place, maybe I screwed it up. I\u2019m so sorry, Bruce.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t screw up anything,\u201d Bruce says. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019m sure that you got it exactly right.\u201d\n\u201cThen why isn\u2019t it working?\u201d\nBruce thoughtfully regards the glass. \u201cMaybe I need to drink it all,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll just-\u201c\nTim catches his wrist. \u201cStop,\u201d he says again. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n\u201cThis is important to you,\u201d Bruce says. \u201cSo it\u2019s important to me, too.\u201d\n\u201cBut I basically roofied you,\u201d Tim protests. \n\u201cTim,\u201d Bruce says, \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter what you do. I\u2019ll always be on your side. I\u2019ll always have your back. So let\u2019s-\u201c\nHe gets cut off mid-sentence. \n\u201c-figure this out together,\u201d he says to an empty kitchen.\n*\nFinally.\nBetween one blink and the next, Batman has been transported from the bedroom to the kitchen. He knows what this means. \nHe takes a second to inspect his surroundings. It wouldn\u2019t do to make a mistake now. The curtains are drawn, probably to keep out the heat, and the calendar on the wall tells him it\u2019s mid-July, same as the universe he just left. There is also Tim, dressed in shorts and a t-shirt and staring at him, fiddling with his hands like he\u2019s nervous about something. \n\u201cBruce?\u201d he asks tentatively. \n\u201cRed Robin,\u201d Batman says in greeting. \u201cTook you long enough.\u201d\nTim slumps. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure which timeline you\u2019d been transported to, so I first had to find your coordinates, which-\u201c\n\u201cDon\u2019t make excuses,\u201d Batman says. \u201cBe better next time. Where are the others?\u201d\n\u201cJason is in his room, and Dick and Damian-\u201c Tim stops as animated voices suddenly drift in from the direction of the foyer. \u201c-just arrived.\u201d\nHis room, Batman thinks. He\u2019s been gone for several weeks. Did Jason move back in? Something to think about later. \n\u201cTimothy,\u201d Damian calls out before he\u2019s even entered the kitchen, \u201cyou must give me a lift tomorrow. Grayson embarrassed me.\u201d\n\u201cUh, guys-\u201c\n\u201cI didn\u2019t embarrass him,\u201d Dick says, coming in and immediately making a beeline towards the fridge, \u201call I did was-\u201c\n\u201cGuys-\u201c\n\u201c-you pinched my cheek. In front of everybody.\u201d\n\u201cSeriously, just-\u201c\n\u201cEnough,\u201d Batman thunders, and instantly, everybody falls silent. He notes that Dick and Damian have snapped to attention. Good. \u201cNightwing,\u201d he says, \u201cyou\u2019re accompanying me to the Cave. I want to hear about your patrol routes during my absence. Robin, Red Robin, I expect to see you in the training room. No more slacking off, and no more-\u201c He nods towards the iced tea that\u2019s sitting in front of Tim. \u201c-indulgences.\u201d \nTim nods, while the others appear to be frozen still. It doesn\u2019t matter. Now that Batman is back, he has more than enough time to restore order to this house.\n*\nThe last few weeks have felt, at times, like a fever dream. Like something from Jason\u2019s deepest, most secret desires. A family that only argues about who ate the last cereal instead of who made what mistakes on patrol. A father who genuinely cares. \nOther times, it\u2019s felt almost like a cruel joke. This is what they could have had, had they only been born in a different timeline. \nFever dream or joke, whatever it is, it\u2019s over now. It\u2019s been over for days. On Wednesday morning, Jason came downstairs to find Damian and Tim training, and when he, following a hunch, went further downstairs to the Cave, he found Batman shouting at Dick. \nNot Bruce. Batman. \nThe worst thing is that Dick has just taken it. For as long as Jason can remember, Batman and Dick have gotten into screaming matches loud enough to be heard three houses over. It\u2019s not been pleasant, exactly, but at least he always got the impression that Dick could hold his own. He still follows Batman where it counts, yes, but he also made it pretty clear when he disagreed with Batman\u2019s methods. \nThat is not what Jason saw this time. \nThis time, Batman shouted while Dick just stood there, head bowed, fists clenched, like he actually agreed. \nJason didn\u2019t stick around to see the rest. He can guess. \nSo he packed up his shit, and he returned to one of his safehouses, and he\u2019s spent the days since then obsessively checking the news for any Batman and Robin sightings, and obsessively checking his phone for any news directly from his family. There are plenty of Batman sightings but, somehow, no Robin ones. \nHis phone stays silent. The family group chat, wherein just a few days ago Bruce had sent a clip of one cat licking another cat\u2019s ears, and which is usually spammed by Dick at least once every hour, does not have a single new message added to it. It\u2019s eery. \nIf Jason is honest with himself, which admittedly does not happen a whole lot, he can admit that he always knew they would have to return Bruce to his own universe eventually. That he was here in the first place was a fluke, and while Jason personally would have been happy to leave Batman stuck in another timeline, it\u2019s clear that his siblings would disagree. \nBut. \nBruce had seemed so sure that he was going to stay for a while. He kept telling Jason to go to night school, get his diploma, and then go to college afterwards if he wants. He kept talking about what they should do for everyone\u2019s birthdays, for Christmas, which weekend they should take off to go see the Grand Canyon. Those are not plans made by someone who plans to leave immediately. \nHe hasn\u2019t even said goodbye, is the worst thing. Jason had been in his room listening to music, and when he stopped, Bruce had just been gone. He still doesn\u2019t know how it happened \u2013 randomly, like it did the first time around? Or did Batman figure it out in the other universe and switched them back? Or \u2013 or did Bruce figure it out, somehow, and switched himself back on purpose? \nJason doesn\u2019t know, and it\u2019s driving him crazy. \nOn Saturday, he gets a phone call. \n\u201cI am coming over,\u201d Tim announces. \u201cWhich safehouse are you at? Wait, don\u2019t tell me. The one next to the laundromat where they killed those folks by putting them in a washing machine last month?\u201d \n\u201cYes,\u201d Jason admits reluctantly. Gotham is so messed up. Then Tim\u2019s words catch up with him. \u201cWait, what? Don\u2019t come over.\u201d\n\u201cToo late,\u201d Tim says and rings the bell, which doesn\u2019t seem possible unless Tim has developed superhuman speech.\nThe mystery gets solved when Jason opens the door just in time to see Tim nodding towards Bart, who waves back before taking off. \nInside, Tim inspects every available surface, obviously searching for one that doesn\u2019t have dried blood on it. He won\u2019t find one, Jason knows, and indeed, Tim gives up eventually and just sits down on the couch. \u201cYou\u2019re disgusting,\u201d he declares. \n\u201cMy place may have a little blood problem,\u201d Jason says, \u201cbut at least I\u2019ve never broken an ankle tripping over all my shit because I\u2019m chronically incapable of cleaning up.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not incapable of cleaning up, there\u2019s an order to it, and I tripped over a rugby ball you had left there, going into my room without permission, and also I didn\u2019t even break it.\u201d\n\u201cFor someone who didn\u2019t break it,\u201d Jason says, \u201cyou sure cried about it like a little-\u201c He falters. \u201cWimp,\u201d he says. \n\u201cNice save,\u201d Tim says sarcastically. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t cry, I- wait. Stop it. You\u2019re doing it again.\u201d\n\u201cDoing what? I\u2019m not doing anything.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re riling me up because you want me to leave. That\u2019s not going to work. You literally cannot do or say anything that would make your company less pleasant than staying in the manor right now.\u201d Tim says it like a joke, but Jason doesn\u2019t think it is, somehow. For the first time since Tim arrived, he really looks at him, and he finds he doesn\u2019t like what he sees. \nIf Tim can look this defeated, he thinks, then what about Damian, who is younger? What about Dick, who Jason left alone in the middle of getting screamed at? \n\u201cHow\u2019s the old man?\u201d Jason asks, trying to find even footing again before this conversation gets away from him. \n\u201cHe\u2019s-\u201c Tim\u2019s breath hitches. Jason, alarmed, rests a hand on his shoulder in what he meant to be a supportive gesture the way he\u2019s seen Bruce do, and what came out forceful enough to bruise. He wonders if Tim is going to cry. That would suck, like, so much. \u201cHe\u2019s Batman,\u201d Tim finally says. \u201cThat\u2019s all there is to say, really.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\nFor a while, neither of them says anything. Tim picks at the blood stains on the couch, and Jason tries again with the hand clap, doing a marginally better job this time. \nFinally, because if he doesn\u2019t ask this he\u2019s going to actually go insane, he says, \u201cDid Bruce say anything to you before he left? I mean- did he say goodbye? Or, you know, something else. Or whatever. It\u2019s cool.\u201d\n\u201cHe said he\u2019s on my side,\u201d Tim says, smiling faintly with the memory. \u201cWhich was really nice of him, considering I\u2019d just roofied him. He also-\u201c\n\u201cStop, wait, stop, go back. You what?\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Tim says, sitting up straighter and inching away from Jason a bit, \u201cI sent him back to his universe.\u201d\n\u201cWhat.\u201d\n\u201cIt was clear that none of you were going to do anything about it,\u201d Tim says defensively, \u201cand Batman couldn\u2019t do it himself since that other universe didn\u2019t have the right technology for it, so I had to step up and get him back. And I did.\u201d\n\u201cStand up,\u201d Jason demands. \n\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d \n\u201cJust do it,\u201d Jason says. \nTim stands up, clearly suspicious. Jason stands too. \u201cHey, quick question,\u201d he says. \u201cDo you actively try to be an asshole, or does it just come naturally?\u201d\n\u201cI-\u201c\nJason cuts off his answer by sucker punching him. \n\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d Tim yells as he goes down, \u201cwhat the fuck-\u201c\n\u201cLanguage,\u201d Jason snaps. \u201cGet back up.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not getting back up if you\u2019re just going to punch me again,\u201d Tim says.\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d Jason says. \u201cCome on.\u201d\nTim has only just gotten back on his feet when Jason punches him again. \n\u201cHow dare you,\u201d he says, his whole body vibrating with anger. \u201cHow can you just stand there, in my house, and tell me that you replaced our dad with an abusive sociopath because none of us had the guts to do it ourselves?\u201d\n\u201cI-\u201c\n\u201cStop it,\u201d Jason yells. \u201cStop evading. Stop lying. Just tell me- what did you expect would happen? Did you really think that Batman would return and he\u2019d play house with us just because Bruce did? Are you seriously that delusional?\u201d\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d Tim yells back. \u201cBut Bruce was stuck here. He didn\u2019t choose this life, he was literally forced into it.\u201d\n\u201cLike you forced Batman to make you Robin?\u201d Jason sneers. \nAnd suddenly, it\u2019s like all the anger over being attacked just leaves Tim. He sounds perfectly calm when he says, \u201cYes. Exactly like that. Batman didn\u2019t really want me. And Bruce didn\u2019t really want us. It would\u2019ve been unfair to make him stay here forever.\u201d\n\u201cNo, you know what\u2019s unfair? Putting words in his mouth. Making an assumption based on one man\u2019s character because you just so happen to know an alternate version of him. Did you ask Bruce what he wanted? Of course you didn\u2019t,\u201d he says when Tim mutely shakes his head. \u201cBecause you already know best. You\u2019re just like Batman.\u201d\nTim flinches, harder than he did when Jason hit him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cI really am. I- I was so nervous that Bruce would actually drink that glass. Every time he came near it, I kept wanting to take it away, to pour it all down the drain. But I also kept thinking, maybe this is for the best. Maybe I\u2019m doing him a favour. I guess we\u2019ll never know now. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d \nTim falls silent, but Jason\u2019s mind is already working, stuck on what his little brother just said. I guess we\u2019ll never know now. \nI guess we\u2019ll never know now.\nI guess we\u2019ll never-\n\u201cDoes it only work with switching consciousnesses?\u201d he asks abruptly. \u201cOr could you also send someone over entirely?\u201d\n\u201cSend someone over entirely, I guess,\u201d Tim says. \u201cWhy-\u201c\n\u201cDo it. Send us over there. Let\u2019s go talk to Bruce.\u201d Jason offers Tim a hand up from the floor. Tim stares at it for several seconds, eyes flitting from the proffered hand to Jason\u2019s face. \nHe takes it. \n\u201cAlright,\u201d he agrees. \u201cLet\u2019s talk to Bruce.\u201d\n*\nDick is tired. He has never been this tired in his life. He came close a few times: When Bruce fired him as Robin. When Jason died. When Bruce died. For as long as he can remember, his life has fallen apart, restructured itself, and fallen apart again, in a never-ending cycle. This time it\u2019s fallen apart not because Batman died, but because Batman returned. \nWhat\u2019s worst, he thinks, is that he feels so guilty. When Tim brought Batman back last year, he\u2019d been ecstatic to have him back, relieved to not have to shoulder the burden of Batman and raising Damian anymore. There is none of that now. There should be, but there isn\u2019t. \nBatman thinks Dick failed. \nThe list of accusations is too long to count, so Dick hasn\u2019t bothered. He\u2019s let it all wash over him, has accepted the lecture on why he isn\u2019t good enough, all the while thinking, who is going to kiss Damian goodnight now? Who is going to make sure Tim goes to school? Who is going to talk to Jason without yelling? \nDick. \nBut Dick has already tried to do all of that last time, and while he does a good job of being a big brother, he has to admit he didn\u2019t do a great job at being a dad. He\u2019s still going to try, because someone has to. \nBut a tiny, selfish part of him wonders why it can\u2019t be Batman who tries for once. It\u2019s Batman who adopted all of these kids. Why does it have to be Dick who makes sure this family doesn\u2019t fall apart? \nHe's on his way to the Cave, where he\u2019s supposed to be writing up detailed mission reports not of any actual missions, but on life at the manor these past few weeks, when he walks past the calendar that\u2019s hanging in the kitchen. \nBefore Bruce, that calendar hadn\u2019t held too much information. Some birthdays, if they remembered to note them down, Damian\u2019s occasional dentist appointment, a gala Batman needed to attend as Bruce Wayne. But Bruce had been weirdly obsessed with that calendar. He\u2019d insisted on putting down everything. Every appointment, every family activity, even mealtimes. Family Dinner: 7 pm is scrawled across every single day. \nLooking at it now, Dick immediately takes note of two things. First, Damian\u2019s art class is doing an exhibition tonight. Second, it\u2019s Tim\u2019s birthday tomorrow.\nIn the Batcave, Batman is at the Batcomputer, evidently hacking into police files. \u201cJuly 11th,\u201d he says without turning around. \u201cWhere were you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Dick says. \u201cCan I talk to you for a second?\u201d\n\u201cThere was an armed robbery. In Nightwing\u2019s domain. Where were you?\u201d \nDick thinks back. \u201cParent-teacher\u2019s night for Tim\u2019s class, just before the holidays started,\u201d he says as it comes back to him. \u201cBruce- I mean, the other you, went to talk to Tim\u2019s teachers, and we all went out for pancakes afterwards to celebrate that Tim isn\u2019t failing physics anymore.\u201d \n\u201cThere was an armed robbery,\u201d Batman repeats. \u201cIn Nightwing\u2019s domain.\u201d\n\u201cAnd it was parent-teacher\u2019s night for Tim\u2019s class,\u201d Dick repeats. \nAt this, Batman does turn around. He is scowling. \u201cRed Robin is a vigilante. Tim Drake is CEO of Wayne Enterprises. What is he doing in high school?\u201d\n\u201cGetting his diploma, I suppose,\u201d Dick snaps before he can stop himself. \u201cLook, can we not do this right now? I wanted to talk to you about something.\u201d\n\u201cI will talk to Red Robin about this,\u201d Batman says, no longer listening. He types something, then asks, \u201cWhere were you on June 29th?\u201d\nSensing that this isn\u2019t going anywhere, Dick decides to ignore him. \u201cDamian\u2019s art class has an exhibition tonight at eight,\u201d he says. \u201cTheir teacher rented a room at Gotham Gallery for it. I\u2019m going, obviously, but I just wanted to ask- well, I just think it\u2019d be nice for Damian if you could come, too.\u201d\n\u201cJune 29th. Another robbery in Nightwing\u2019s domain.\u201d\n\u201cDid you hear what I said?\u201d\n\u201cI heard you.\u201d\n\u201cWell? Are you coming?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t have time to attend the school events of a fifth grader. Neither should you or Robin. I expected better from you both.\u201d\n\u201cDamian,\u201d Dick says slowly, \u201cis ten years old.\u201d\n\u201cHe is Robin.\u201d\nDick laughs. It comes out slightly hysterical. He is feeling slightly hysterical. \u201cThis is pointless,\u201d he realises. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I bothered. By the way, it\u2019s Tim\u2019s birthday tomorrow. He\u2019s turning seventeen. Did you know that? Do you care? What do you think we should get him as a gift? Should we bake him a cake? Or is cake too much of an indulgence for a seventeen-year-old?\u201d\n\u201cYou are forgetting yourself.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I am. I think I\u2019ve never seen things more clearly, actually.\u201d Dick laughs again. The absurdity of the situation hits him all at once. \u201cWe\u2019re not your kids, we\u2019re your soldiers. I can\u2019t believe I never realised this before.\u201d\n\u201cNightwing, take a walk,\u201d Batman orders sharply. \u201cCome back when you\u2019ve composed yourself.\u201d \n\u201cYou know what the funny thing is? You almost got me to be just like you. I thought I was, when I made Damian Robin. I thought I was doomed to repeat your mistakes, over and over again. But then I realised that I don\u2019t have to. That if I do something wrong, I can make up for it. I can try again, try to get it right this time around. Have you ever done that? Just once? I don\u2019t think you have. I think you just wait until the next kid comes around. The next blank slate who can be turned into Robin.\u201d\n\u201cEnough.\u201d Batman stands, and for one crazy moment, Dick thinks Batman is going to hit him. But Batman just points at the door. \u201cLeave, or I\u2019ll make you.\u201d\n\u201cFuck you,\u201d Dick says. \u201cJust, seriously, go fuck yourself. I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m done.\u201d Every instinct in him is screaming not to turn his back on Batman, but he does. \nHe's only taken three steps when he runs into a broad chest. Batman. \nNo, not Batman. \nBruce.\n*\nBruce has never thought about how big his house is. How ridiculous it is for a single person to live in a manor. There is nothing but space here, nothing but empty rooms, nothing but silence except for his own footsteps. \nHe tries to take time off work, only to realise that in his absence, his counterpart has already informed Wayne Enterprises that he\u2019s going on an extended sabbatical. All for the better. This way, Bruce can quite literally spend all his time brooding. \nThe first thing he does, when he realises what happened, is to look up Dick and Jason. He finds nothing on Dick, but there is an article about Jason, just a photo of all the high school graduates from some local school, with Jason, who towers over most of his classmates, standing in the last row, third from left and smiling into the camera. \nTim, he doesn\u2019t have to google. He knows he\u2019s just a house over, no more than a mile away. That makes it worse, somehow. \nDamian, he doesn\u2019t have to google either. In this universe, Bruce has never slept with Damian\u2019s mother, so Damian does not exist. \nBruce thinks about going to see Tim, at least, but he doesn\u2019t even finish the thought before realising that there\u2019s no way he could. Not only would it break his heart, but it is also just plainly creepy, visiting an almost-seventeen-year-old who doesn\u2019t know him. \nAlmost seventeen.\nHe's going to miss Tim\u2019s birthday, and Damian\u2019s exhibition, and the rugby game Jason wanted to go see with him even though neither of them care about rugby, and his weekly midnight milkshake with Dick. Instead, his counterpart is going to get to do all of that with them, and the worst thing, the absolute worst thing, is that Bruce knows, deep down, from all he knows about Batman, that his counterpart isn\u2019t going to bother. \nHe wonders how long it\u2019s going to take before Tim and Damian go back to being vigilantes. How long until Tim drops out of school, until Damian drops out of school. Until Jason moves back out. \nHe is so busy brooding that he almost misses the sound of the key clicking inside the lock. Almost.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe that worked,\u201d someone says, just as Bruce has gripped a vase to use as a potential weapon. \u201cSame locks. That doesn\u2019t seem very safe.\u201d\n\u201cTo be fair, it\u2019s not like people regularly jump in between timelines just to rob themselves,\u201d says a second voice. \nBruce knows both of these voices.\nHe drops the vase.\nFootsteps, but not his own this time. Two sets, one slightly heavier than the other. \nBruce doesn\u2019t wait for them to reach them. He meets them halfway. Just as they round the corner, he pulls both of them into a hug, not giving them time to breathe, to say anything, to do anything but hug him back.\nSomehow, Tim and Jason have come to his universe, and they\u2019ve come to see him. \u201cBruce,\u201d comes Tim\u2019s slightly choked voice, \u201clet me go- you\u2019re strangling me-\u201c\nBruce pulls back, but only slightly, just enough to ease up. \u201cLet me enjoy this,\u201d he mumbles into their hair. \u201cJust a moment longer.\u201d\nHe's not sure, but he thinks Jason just hissed, See?\n\u201cAlright,\u201d he says when he finally feels ready to let them go. \u201cOut with it. What\u2019s the bad news?\u201d\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t any,\u201d Tim says at the same time that Jason says, \u201cWe want you to come back because we hate Batman.\u201d\nBruce\u2019s mouth drops open. \n\u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d Jason says. \u201cBatman sucks. And you don\u2019t suck, so we want you back. You have to come home with us.\u201d And, when Bruce doesn\u2019t immediately reply, he adds a quiet, devastating, \u201cPlease, Bruce.\u201d\nTim, unaware of the many conflicting emotions raging inside Bruce right now, elbows his brother and says, \u201cThat\u2019s not- we\u2019re not guilt-tripping you. I swear we\u2019re not. Any choice you make is fine. We just wanted- I guess we just wanted you to know that you can come home with us. If you wanted to.\u201d\nJason nods rapidly, looking more desperate than Bruce has ever seen him. \u201cPlease,\u201d he says again. \nBruce\u2019s heart is breaking, breaking, breaking. \n\u201cAh, children,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for leaving you like that.\u201d\nTim rubs the back of his neck. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought I was doing you a favour.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Bruce says simply, and Tim\u2019s eyes widen in surprise. \u201cYou said so already when I drank that juice. You said that you knew I didn\u2019t have any kids in this universe, and that there must be a reason. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Tim admits. \n\u201cWell, you\u2019re right. There is a reason. I\u2019ve always thought myself to be pretty indifferent to children. Had the right partner come alone, I would\u2019ve been open, but she never did, so it\u2019s never even been a consideration. Deep down, I always suspected that I might not make the best father. But when I woke up in your universe and realised I had not just one child, but four, all that indifference and all of those worries just fell away, just like that. Suddenly, there was nothing more important than you kids. And it\u2019s been killing me, knowing that I\u2019m just standing in for somebody else, somebody who puts you in danger and doesn\u2019t care for your wellbeing, somebody who wears my face while telling you you\u2019re inadequate.\u201d Bruce stops, breathes for a moment. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, you\u2019re my kids. Mine. Not Batman\u2019s. I can appreciate you trying to give me a choice, but to be honest, my choice was made the minute I woke up in that bed and heard your voices.\u201d \n\u201cSo you\u2019re coming with us?\u201d Jason demands. \nBruce nods. \u201cI\u2019m coming with you. But first, let me pack a suitcase. If I\u2019m taking Batman\u2019s place, I want to do it in my own clothes this time.\u201d\n*\nThey end up bringing three suitcases and a yoga mat. Bruce is carrying two suitcases, Jason is carrying one, and Tim was allowed to carry the yoga mat. He feels vaguely insulted, but mostly, he feels really, breathtakingly, burst-to-the-brims happy. He keeps glancing at Bruce from the side as they walk through the hallways of the manor \u2013 well, both manors \u2013, worried that if he blinks or looks away, Bruce is going to just disappear. But he doesn\u2019t. He stays, and every time he catches Tim looking, he smiles at him. \nJason must be happy too, Tim thinks. He, too, glances at Bruce a lot. \nBruce is staying. Batman is still here, and they can\u2019t exactly send him back to the other universe, which means they have two Bruce Waynes now and they will have to figure something out, but none of that matters right now, because Bruce is staying, and that\u2019s the most important part. Tim thinks he can take a hundred punches to the face for that. \n\u201cHow did you get that black eye?\u201d Bruce had asked earlier during packing, and Tim had shrugged. \n\u201cSlight disagreement between brothers,\u201d he\u2019d replied. \u201cWe\u2019re fine now.\u201d\n\u201cIf you say so,\u201d Bruce had said, clearly doubtful, but willing to let it slide. \n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see Dickie\u2019s face,\u201d Jason says now, after they\u2019ve finished putting Bruce\u2019s things into his bedroom. \u201cWhat do you think he\u2019s going to say?\u201d \nEver since they arrived back in this timeline, Bruce hasn\u2019t said all that much. His eyes have a faraway look in them, like he\u2019s thinking about something else entirely. \u201cI think-\u201c He stops, suddenly, head tilted slightly. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cGo where?\u201d Jason asks, but Bruce is already walking through the hallways at a brisk pace. \u201cBruce! Go where?\u201d\nTim swallows. He knows what Bruce heard. \u201cDick is shouting,\u201d he says. \u201cDown in the Cave.\u201d \nJason\u2019s hesitation only lasts a second before he nods and starts jogging to catch up with Bruce. \u201cHey, Bruce! Wait up!\u201d\nBruce doesn\u2019t wait up. By the time he reaches the grandfather clock in the main study, Tim and Jason have to run to keep up with him. \u201cWhat\u2019s the code?\u201d Bruce asks, voice unusually sharp. \nTim and Jason both wince. \n\u201cWhat?\u201d Bruce asks impatiently. \u201cI saw you kids open this entrance by resetting the time, but I didn\u2019t see the numbers. Is it the day of someone else\u2019s gruesome murder? What is it?\u201d\n\u201cTen-forty-eight,\u201d Tim says. \u201cThat\u2019s the time your-\u201c\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Bruce says as he moves the hands to 10:48, the time his parents died. \u201cOf course it is.\u201d\nThe shouting gets louder as they enter the Cave, loud enough to make out some words. They\u2019re arguing about Damian, Tim thinks, and, with a sinking feeling, realises that no, now they stopped to argue about him instead. It makes his breathing go all funny, listening to two people argue about his birthday, of all things, about the way he\u2019d behaved at that last gala, about his C in English, about whether hiring a new nanny is really worth it if he\u2019s old enough to take care of himself-\n\u201cHey,\u201d Jason says, flicking his fingers against Tim\u2019s face and bringing him back to reality. \u201cDon\u2019t space out.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not spacing out,\u201d Tim says, but he says it absently, because now that he\u2019s tuned back in, he can hear Dick yelling-\n\u201cI think you just wait until the next kid comes around. The next blank slate who can be turned into Robin.\u201d\nJason is frozen to the spot, and this time it\u2019s Tim who flicks his fingers against his face. \u201cDon\u2019t space out,\u201d he says, and, realising something is wrong- \u201cWhere\u2019s Bruce?\u201d\n\u201cEnough.\u201d That\u2019s the growling voice of Batman, ringing through the Cave like a gunshot. \u201cLeave, or I\u2019ll make you.\u201d\n\u201cFuck you,\u201d Dick says, just as they enter the main area of the Cave. Batman and Dick are facing each other, but Dick turns to leave, now, tenser than Tim has ever seen him. Angrier, too. \u201cJust, seriously, go fuck yourself. I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m done.\u201d \nBruce steps out of the shadows just as Dick goes to leave. It is, Tim reflects, a very Batman-like thing to do. \nDick freezes at the sight of Bruce. \nSo does Batman. \n\u201cBruce?\u201d Dick asks, shocked. \u201cWhat are you doing here? Why aren\u2019t you back in your own universe?\u201d\n\u201cYour brothers reminded me of something important,\u201d Bruce says, lips quirking upwards. \n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cThat all the people I care about are in this universe.\u201d\nDick hugs him, then, and Tim is torn between the urge to step forward and join in, and to keep his distance and avert his eyes, because this moment feels too intimate somehow. \nIt turns out he needn\u2019t have worried, because Batman seems to have regained his composure. \u201cNightwing, step away,\u201d he growls. \u201cNow.\u201d\nIt's pretty clear to Tim that Dick intends to do no such thing, but then Bruce is shoving him away \u2013 no, shoving him behind him. And as Batman takes one threatening step forward, Tim realises that Jason just stepped in front of him, too. Bruce is shielding Dick, and Jason is shielding Tim, and it\u2019s ridiculous because neither of them need protection since they can handle themselves, but it still makes Tim\u2019s eyes prickle. \nIt's only later that he thinks about it and knows: he knew they could protect themselves, he didn't know that Batman wouldn't hurt them. He still isn't sure. \n\u201cGet away from him,\u201d Batman demands. It is unclear whether he is talking to Bruce or to Dick, until he says, \u201cYou are a danger to this universe. You have managed to compromise Nightwing and the others. I don\u2019t know what method you used, but rest assured that I will find out, and I will make you pay.\u201d\n\u201cMy method,\u201d Bruce says, \u201cis called parenting. You should try it sometime.\u201d\nBatman takes another step forward. And suddenly Tim can see it all play out in his mind. He knows exactly what\u2019s going to happen. \nBatman has two priorities right now: get Dick away, and subdue Bruce. Since talking has not worked, and Bruce is shielding Dick, Batman will have to act on the second agenda in order to complete the first. He is going to attack Bruce. \nBruce will put up a fight. By now, Tim has learned not to underestimate him. So Bruce will fight. \nBut in the end, Batman is more skilled, more experienced. He may not be wearing his armour, but Bruce is still no match for him. It's going to be quick and brutal, and by the end of it, Bruce will end up locked in a cell, likely injured, highly guarded, until Batman figures out what to do with him. Tim can see it all.\nBut nobody sees him. They aren\u2019t paying attention to him at all. Batman is slowly approaching, Bruce is trying to keep Dick behind him, and Jason- \nJason is looking straight at Tim, eyes narrowed. Then he nods. And then he flicks Tim\u2019s face.\n\u201cThis is your last chance,\u201d Batman says. Then he seems to sense something, years of fighting crime having honed his instincts, and he turns his head slightly, but it\u2019s too late. \nTim\u2019s plan had been to put himself between Bruce and Batman, catching the first and maybe second hit while Dick realises what\u2019s going on and gets Bruce to safety. \nThat, it turns out, is not Jason\u2019s plan.\nJason has taken out his gun and shot Batman in the thigh. \nBatman, to his credit, doesn\u2019t go down. He merely grimaces, but remains standing, eyes going from Jason, to Dick, and finally settling on Tim. \u201cRed Robin,\u201d he snaps. \u201cDon\u2019t just stand there. Help.\u201d\nTim crosses his arms and doesn\u2019t move. \u201cMy name,\u201d he says, \u201cis Tim.\u201d\n*\nMetropolis is too bright. Batman needs darkness, needs the shadows, needs Gotham. But it has been made clear by the impostor that Gotham is off-limits. That Wayne Manor is off-limits. Batman\u2019s life has been stolen from him by someone who wears his face and bears his name, and he has had no choice but to let this happen, because with an injury like that, it\u2019s best to retreat. \nHe cannot believe Jason shot him. \nHe cannot believe his children would turn on him like that. Nightwing, perhaps. He\u2019s always been weak, eager to please. Jason, maybe, at least the Jayson that returned from the dead. \nBut Red Robin and Robin. Their betrayal, Batman had not expected. \nFollowing a strange impulse, he pulls out his phone. His actual phone; the one thing the impostor has not been able to take from him. His thigh hurts as he has to stretch to get it from the couch table \u2013 Ikea, he notes sourly. Clark has abysmal taste \u2013, but he manages. \nHe pulls up the group chat without thinking. There have not been any new messages in several days; no doubt they created another as soon as Batman was out the door, flown away to safety by Superman. \nHe scrolls up, past cat videos and strings of emojis, some of which the impostor has sent, until he reaches the first photograph. It\u2019s the five of them, standing in front of a lake and smiling widely, except that it\u2019s not the five of them, because that person on the picture is not Batman. \nBruce Wayne looks happier, he thinks. Happier than Batman can ever remember himself being. \nHe closes the chat, puts away the phone, and leans back. As he does, his eyes fall on the calendar in the kitchen. July 19th. Something in his memory shifts, ready to be acknowledged, but as much as he thinks about it, he can\u2019t remember why today\u2019s date would ring a bell.\nHe supposes that if he cannot recall, it can\u2019t be that important."
