    "text": "Kaveh\u2019s not quite sure how he never noticed.\n\u00a0\nFor a man of his intellect, it\u2019s rather embarrassing that he didn\u2019t draw the conclusion sooner. Clearly, his time at Kshahrewar taught him nothing \u2013\u2013 especially nothing about observational skills.\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s an architect, he\u2019s supposed to have an eye for picking up the details put right in front of him. His eyes have been trained to weed out the elements hidden in plain sight. He can differentiate between the intricate Ashvattha floral tiling styles. Various fabrics and textiles are no match for his particular tastes, but  this  has managed to somehow completely escape his attention.\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham is deaf.\n\u00a0\nIn all the years of knowing the man, and as his roommate, Kaveh cannot believe that he had no idea that Alhaitham is hard of hearing. It\u2019s even more embarrassing now, since they live together. He wants to be angry \u2013 angry that Alhaitham didn\u2019t tell him sooner (or at all, really) \u2013 but he\u2019s more mad at himself for not coming to the conclusion faster.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s taken Kaveh an entire year of living under the same roof as the brutish idiot to figure it out.\n\u00a0\nTo his credit, Alhaitham was pretty good at hiding his deafness. His speech is unhindered and he spoke just as fluently as any other hearing person. He also reacts to sound and is capable of having conversations with his back turned to people (a fact that Kaveh has experienced firsthand, on  multiple occasions). He\u2019s deaf, but he\u2019s not helpless.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe doesn\u2019t know exactly  how deaf  Alhaitham is. It could range anywhere from moderate hearing loss to a total lack of hearing, but the fact still remained. Now that Kaveh\u2019s scrutinizing it, there were a few obvious tells:\n\u00a0\n1.) Alhaitham has a very intense stare. He\u2019s observational to a fault.\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham was constantly aware of his surroundings. He had a tendency to survey everything he came across with an analytical stare. His eyes would flicker to every doorway that opened, regardless of if it creaked on the hinges or not. He would take note of every person who entered the room and have their mannerisms committed to memory after conversing once.\n\u00a0\nThe level of detail he paid mind to was truly impressive, and Kaveh thinks that he might have made a wonderful architect if he didn\u2019t have an absolute and utter disregard for the arts.\n\u00a0\nWhen they first met, Kaveh was intimidated by Alhaitham\u2019s sharp green and red pupils following every minute movement, taking in every shuffle, twitch of muscle, and breath of air with rapt attention.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTo be completely honest, it was a little off-putting. Kaveh felt unnecessarily exposed under Alhaitham\u2019s acute gaze, and he was hyper aware of every movement he made around the man.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis was especially true whenever Kaveh would speak directly to him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe first few months of their friendship consisted of Kaveh talking  at  Alhaitham, rather than  with  him, and while most would consider it rude, it was really the only way the two were able to communicate. (Kaveh uses this term\u2026.  loosely.  ) He quickly picked up that Alhaitham was not much of a conversationalist and was more than content with being a listening ear, but  Archons,  the way he goes about it is the most pretentious, asshole-y thing ever.\n\u00a0\nKaveh would start a spiel and Alhaitham wouldn\u2019t even glance up from whatever book he\u2019s got his nose buried in this time around.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt pissed Kaveh off to no end. He flourishes under a shower of attention (as reported by his peers, he likes to describe it as preferring to have an engaged audience), and the lack of visual response made Kaveh feel like his words were going in one ear and out the other.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEventually, after nearly a month of one-sided rants, Kaveh stops his praise of the construction of Pardis Dhyai and explosively yells, \u201cDamn it, Alhaitham, look at me when I\u2019m talking to you! Are you even listening to me?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe words cause Alhaitham\u2019s spine to stiffen, and for a long, horrible moment, Kaveh fears that he may have gone too far. He waits for Alhaitham to say something,  anything , and when the linguist remains quiet, Kaveh physically wilts.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe air had gone cold around them, and Kaveh can practically feel the ire radiating off of Alhaitham. It\u2019s not exactly a secret that Alhaitham\u2019s not the most\u2026 social person at the Akademiya, but Kaveh can tell that he\u2019s a good friend. Of course he would be listening.\n\u00a0\nAn apology formed at the edge of his lips, but he holds his tongue, and decides to just start packing up his things. It\u2019s obvious that Alhaitham didn\u2019t want him there, and it would do well to just leave.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWith his heart in his stomach, and the guilt of what he said weighing down on his chest, Kaveh focuses his eyes downward as he shoves his drafting papers and sticks of charcoal into his bag. His eyes start to burn and he feels  awful .\n\u00a0\nThen, Alhaitham asks, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\n\u00a0\nKaveh freezes as he lifts the top of his knapsack. A quizzical noise escapes his throat and he looks over at Alhaitham.\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s put his book down, a bookmark shoved in between the pages, and green eyes trained on him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI, uh.\u201d says Kaveh intelligently, unable to handle the weight of Alhaitham\u2019s stare.\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham  tsks  , taking initiative, \u201cYou were talking about how the design of the Pardis Dhyai drew inspiration from the surrounding flora,\u201d he rolls his eyes as he makes quotations marks and repeats in a mockery of Kaveh\u2019s voice, \u201c  the open air concept truly is reminiscent of a Nilotpala Lotus blossoming in the dead of night. A work of genius! \u201d\n\u00a0\nKaveh makes an undignified noise, \u201cI do  not  sound like that!\u201d He ignores the way his chest tightens at the fact that Alhaitham  was  listening.\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham crosses his arms as he resettles in his chair, his body facing toward Kaveh now. \u201cHad me fooled, honestly. But do go on.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKaveh launches a stub of charcoal at him before returning to his monologue, trying to tamp down the fuzzy feeling in his chest.\n\u00a0\nThe way Alhaitham\u2019s eyes carefully watched his lips as they moved sent shivers down Kaveh\u2019s spine. (A furious blush also began to creep its way up his neck but he\u2019s not touching  that  with a 10 foot pole. He\u2019ll just have to live with saying that he was caught off guard by how intently Alhaitham was listening to him at that moment).\n\u00a0\nKaveh has never doubted if Alhaitham was listening after that.\n\u00a0\nBut he understands now that Alhaitham was reading his lips because he couldn\u2019t hear, not staring him down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.) Alhaitham signs to himself sometimes.\n\u00a0\nThe action is much more subdued nowadays, but back at the Akademiya, Kaveh would notice him fidgeting with his hands sometimes when poring over an assignment. At first, he thought it was a nervous tic, but hindsight is 20/20. Alhaitham\u2019s hands would lazily sign something as he skimmed a textbook, though it seemed that he was completely unaware of it. Kaveh has no idea what exactly it was that he signed, but he thinks it may have been a memorization trick, much like how repeating something out loud would help the idea stick.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe habit shows its face at home, whenever Alhaitham is reviewing documents for his job as the Scribe, or whenever he\u2019s in a hurry to memorize mission notes and needs to retain the information quickly.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKaveh hasn\u2019t commented on the action in fear of Alhaitham stopping out of embarrassment, so it\u2019s a private little moment that Kaveh holds dear to his heart when he catches Alhaitham in the act.\n\u00a0\nThese days, Alhaitham has taken to crossing his arms whenever talking to people. He says it serves as an intimidation tactic, and proves incredibly useful whenever he\u2019s interrogating or trying to wheedle information out of someone. Kaveh thinks it\u2019s bullshit, he\u2019s pretty sure that he just wants to put his infuriatingly beefy arms on display because he secretly likes being ogled at. But he can see the way Alhaitham\u2019s fingers twitch where they rest on his bicep, the digits halfway to forming a word mid-conversation.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3.) He literally wears a hearing aid all the time.\n\u00a0\nKaveh has never seen him without it. The green and the gold accents of the device are a stark contrast against his ash gray hair, and practically scream  \u2018Hey, look at me!\u2019 \n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s never thought to ask Alhaitham about it because if he\u2019s being honest, Kaveh thought that it was just some random accessory that he had taken to wearing everyday. It\u2019s hardly the strangest thing that he\u2019s seen people wear around the Akademiya. It\u2019s student culture to modify the uniform to the point of being unrecognizable. He himself has added a few accessories to his daily wear.\n\u00a0\nHe should have picked up on it immediately when he moved in. Alhaitham never took it off, even when he sheds his nonsensical, ridiculously  tight  outfit that he wears everyday for his looser-fitting lounge clothes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe only time Kaveh can recall seeing him without the earpiece is when he accidentally ran into Alhaitham leaving the bathroom after a shower.\n\u00a0\nHis things were bundled up in his arms and a towel was secured around his waist, his upper half entirely exposed. In the warm light of the oil lamps scattered around the house, Kaveh could see the way the water from Alhaitham\u2019s hastily-dried hair tantalizingly trailed down his neck to his sculpted chest. It took Kaveh a little too long to realize what was happening before turning around and muttering something about indecency and regard for other people.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s safe to say that Kaveh was too distracted by other things to notice that he hadn\u2019t put his hearing aid back in.\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham eyed his form quietly, the ghost of a smile hinting at his lips. He hadn\u2019t heard exactly what Kaveh said, but he had an idea. He shuffles past Kaveh, annoyingly unaffected, and it takes all of the architect\u2019s willpower to not crumble on the spot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5.) Alhaitham is constantly adjusting his hearing aid.\n\u00a0\nAdding on to the last point, Kaveh notices that Alhaitham has a habit of reaching up to his hearing aid and adjusting the settings on it. Kaveh originally thought that he was just scratching an itch or moving a piece of hair out of his face, but after some subtle observation (it was  observation , to sate his researcher\u2019s heart, not infatuated staring, because what a ridiculous notion that is, right?), he notices the nearly-imperceptible dials and sliders on the side of the aid.\n\u00a0\nWhenever in a noisy area like a busy cafe, or when the students in the Akademiya\u2019s library get a little too rowdy, Alhaitham will brush his fingertips over the side of the aid and adjust the volume level. Or so Kaveh suspects, he still hasn\u2019t had the courage to ask him exactly how the device works. It\u2019s a matter of pride at this point.\n\u00a0\nHe recalls that Alhaitham once said that they\u2019re noise canceling, and he wonders if that was some sort of subtle joke towards his deafness or the actual truth. It\u2019s hard to tell with his imperturbable attitude.\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham loves to take full advantage of the feature, especially in arguments with Kaveh, because he likes to tune out Kaveh  entirely  by turning the damn thing off.\n\u00a0\nKaveh used to think that Alhaitham had mastered the art of ignoring him. The man would remain unflappable as he continued to read his worn copy of  The Origins of Enkanomiyan Language , even when Kaveh was a hair\u2019s breadth away from shattering the windows of their house with his severity of pitch.\n\u00a0\nNo amount of screaming, threats to throw things, or violently waving in front of him could get Alhaitham to pause in his thirst for knowledge. As it turns out, Alhaitham literally just turns his hearing aids off so he doesn\u2019t have to listen to Kaveh.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s for this exact reason that Kaveh has decided to learn Sumerian Sign Language.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2026\n\u00a0\nOkay, perhaps it\u2019s not the  only  reason. Deep down, Kaveh believes that it\u2019s his duty as Alhaitham\u2019s roommate to learn what is technically his native language, but he also refuses to lose arguments because of something so petty.\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s tired of their debates getting cut short because Alhaitham doesn\u2019t want to listen to him anymore. It\u2019s then that he devises the perfect plan: he\u2019s going to become fluent in SSL, and the next time Alhaitham decides he\u2019s amounted to background noise, he\u2019ll continue the conversation right where he left off.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a bit of an audacious plan, he will admit, but Kaveh is nothing if not stubborn. He will get the final word if it\u2019s the last thing he does.\n\u00a0\nSo, he studies. It\u2019s quite possibly the worst thing to ever happen to him.\n\u00a0\nAlthough he graduated top of his class, Kaveh was just blessed to be born with a natural affinity to the material given to him. All it took for him to nail a concept was a single explanation or demonstration and he\u2019s already committed it to memory. He\u2019s never had to study or practice for a single test.\n\u00a0\nWhich is what makes learning SSL so difficult.\n\u00a0\nFor any language, the basis of learning is repetition. It means doing the same thing over and over and over again until it becomes second nature.\n\u00a0\nKaveh never had the patience for any of that. He\u2019s too fidgety to be able to sit down and study the same information for an extended period, he constantly wants to do more, even if he hasn\u2019t entirely mastered something yet. \u201cThe jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one\u201d and all that.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not very conducive to his learning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis is awful,\u201d he complains as he rests his forehead on the desk, his hands still held in the air, fingers caught between fingerspelling his name for the fifteenth time. \u201cDo we really have to do this?\u201d\n\u00a0\nTighnari, who has so graciously offered to be his teacher (Kaveh showed up at his doorstep and practically begged him), whacks him on the head with a roll of paper. \u201cNo talking, I\u2019m deaf and I can\u2019t hear you. Also, sit up. Half of SSL is rooted in facial expressions. Practicing with your face down on the desk is the equivalent of speaking with a muffled voice.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAlright, alright,\u201d Kaveh grumbles as he sits up, \u201cI thought it was customary for the deaf person to give you a name, so why do I have to spell it out?\u201d\n\u00a0\nTighnari crosses his arms and leans back in his chair, an eyebrow raised mockingly at him, \u201cDo you always ask stupid questions? How are they supposed to give you a name if they don\u2019t know how to spell it?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou know, if I wanted a green asshole to teach me SSL I would have just asked Alhaitham to teach me himself.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTighnari rolls his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who wants to learn. Don\u2019t take it out on me.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKaveh\u2019s digits cramp on the \u2018V\u2019 in his name and figures that a break is in order. He sits up and massages the joints. He\u2019s pretty sure that he\u2019s never endured this much fatigue in his hands, even when he was practically bound to his chair the year he had to come up with his senior thesis.\n\u00a0\nHis heart stings at the thought of a younger Alhaitham going through the exact same thing.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m curious, how did you become fluent in SSL anyway?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTighnari shrugs, \u201cIt was an elective I took for a few years while at Amurta. I figured it would be useful if I ever had any hard of hearing patients in the future.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKaveh makes a hum of acknowledgement, \u201cWas it worth it? As far as I\u2019m aware, you don\u2019t get too many deaf patients.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTighnari smiles slightly, \u201cI mean, I\u2019m teaching you now, so I would consider it pretty useful.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKaveh evens him out with a dead stare.\n\u00a0\nOne of Tighnari\u2019s ears twitches, and he swats away one of the bugs that had flown into his personal hut. \u201cBut to answer your question, yes, I would consider it pretty worth it. Even though I\u2019ve only had a handful of deaf patients so far, it\u2019s always nice to see the smile they get when they realize that they can communicate comfortably. It\u2019s not something that they experience often.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKaveh wonders how Alhaitham would react. Would he be that appreciative? It\u2019s hard to imagine that his face has the necessary muscles to smile, so that idea is out the window. A more appropriate response would probably be to make fun of him for his clunky signing. Kaveh would not at all be surprised if he had the gall to just close his eyes to avoid the conversation.\n\u00a0\nHe looks forward to it.\n\u00a0\nTighnari, ever the diligent leader, whacks him again with the roll of paper. \u201cBack to work, you\u2019ll never become fluent at this rate.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nKaveh practices every moment he could get to himself. Whenever he goes out to eat, he always signs his order under the table as he reads it off the menu. He bought a small mirror to put in his room to practice his facial expressions. Even during the long hours he spends holed up in his studio to draft, he signs out his entire thought process. He became so engrossed in practicing that he nearly forgot about Alhaitham\u2019s presence in his life. Their exchanges are cut short when Kaveh is always rushing out for work or to visit Tighnari. It leaves no time for their typical banter.\n\u00a0\nOf course, Kaveh could only hide his newfound hobby for so long. The frequent weekends away when he wasn\u2019t scheduled to be the lead architect were bound to rouse suspicion and eventually, Alhaitham picked up on Kaveh\u2019s change in routine and the lack of animosity from the architect. It comes up in conversation one night when he comes home particularly late from Gandharva Ville after a lengthy lesson with Tighnari.\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham is stretched out on the couch in the living room, and doesn\u2019t look up from whatever book he\u2019s reading this time when he asks, \u201cFun night out on the town?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHis tone is dry, and the raised eyebrow he dons could only be referring to the overnight bag that Kaveh has ungraciously slung over his shoulder. He was in Gandharva Ville for longer than he expected, and when he finally checked the clock, it was well past his time to leave. He ended up just shoving all of his belongings back into the bag and not bothering to organize until he got back home.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe trek from Gandharva Ville was not a short one, and it had started raining during the last leg of the trip, so he had no other option but to sprint through the rain all the way back to the house.\n\u00a0\nKaveh had to propose a draft to a construction board the following morning, it was already late at night, and he was dripping all over the floor. He shucks off his shoes and leaves them by the door to dry. He sighs, \u201cCould we not do this right now? I\u2019m tired and I have a proposal meeting tomorrow.\u201d He wants nothing more than to rest.\n\u00a0\nBut Alhaitham has a talent for pushing his buttons. \u201cNot until you tell me where you\u2019ve been going on the weekends.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKaveh pads over to their linen closet to pull out a towel and frowns. \u201cWhat are you, my dad?\u201d\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham flips a page, feigning nonchalance, \u201cHardly. Technically speaking, I\u2019m your landlord, and I think as one of my tenants, I should be allowed to know where you\u2019ve been.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKaveh\u2019s face twitches with annoyance. \u201cWe\u2019re both grown adults, am I not allowed the right to privacy?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe flips another page, and it irks Kaveh, because there was simply no way he had finished a page in that amount of time. He knew Alhaitham, and he could see the beginnings of irritation lingering in his expression. For whatever reason, his outings bother the linguist.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I said, I was simply asking where you\u2019ve been.\u201d\nThe comment causes Kaveh\u2019s eyes to narrow. \u201cWhy does it matter to you, anyway? As far as I was aware, you wanted me out of your house as soon as possible.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnother flipped page, and Kaveh knows for sure that Alhaitham\u2019s just doing it to goad him at this point. Alhaitham\u2019s tone is clipped at his next response. \u201cNo need to get defensive, I was just asking where you go on the weekends. You\u2019re out so often that I\u2019m wondering if you even get the full worth of your rent money.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKaveh\u2019s jaw drops open, \u201cWhat is that supposed to mean?\u201d\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham finally closes the godforsaken book and sits up to place it on the table. His multicolored eyes focus on Kaveh\u2019s form. (He\u2019s still dripping all over the floor, but he\u2019s not sure if it's the dampness or the weight of Alhaitham\u2019s stare that sends shivers down his spine).\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI just simply meant that if you found yourself a place to stay, there\u2019s no point in paying rent here anymore, hm? From the looks of it, you and Tighnari have been getting on swimmingly in Gandharva Ville.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKaveh splutters, because he genuinely has no idea what to say. \u201cTighnari\u2013 what does he have to do with any of this?\u201d Then, \u201cAnd how did you even know about that? I never even told you where I was going?!\u201d\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham purses his lips, \u201cI have my sources\u2013\u2013\u201d\n\u00a0\nKaveh scoffs, \u201cDo your sources include an abuse of diplomatic power?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe continued unhindered, \u201c\u2013\u2013and I found by asking around that you had been regularly asking to hitch caravan rides out of the city to visit a certain Amurta graduate. If I wasn\u2019t looking at you with my own eyes, I might have believed that you were seeking private treatment from him for a hidden ailment. But I think something more personal is afoot.\u201d\n\u00a0\n Something more personal\u2026?  Kaveh shakes his head, flinging droplets of water everywhere. \u201cOkay, wait, wait. Now I\u2019m lost. Care to elaborate? Since you seem to have the whole situation figured out.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham only narrows his eyes.\n\u00a0\nKaveh huffs. \u201cOh, now you\u2019ve got nothing to say? You seemed to be filled with quips when you were  accusing me of being a homewrecker!\u201d  The absurdity of the situation is hilarious, because never in a million years could Kaveh imagine inserting himself into Tighnari and Cyno\u2019s\u2026 relationship? He\u2019s actually not quite sure what their status is, but at this point, he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they had some legal officiation tucked away somewhere.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say that you were a homewrecker, those words came out of your own mouth,\u201d says Alhaitham pettily.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKaveh hits his boiling point, and starts pacing around the living room. \u201cI\u2019m not seeing Tighnari romantically! Archons, Alhaitham what is your deal!? It\u2019s almost like you care about who I\u2019m seeing\u2013\u2013\u201d He\u2019s cut off with a scoff from Alhaitham.\n\u00a0\nA \u201c What is it now?\u201d  was poised on his tongue when the realization struck him. Was Alhaitham\u2026? Surely not, because that would be ridiculous.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe laughs incredulously, \u201cAre you jealous?\u201d\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham\u2019s eyes immediately divert from him and focus elsewhere. He seems to catch his mistake though, and forces his attention back to Kaveh.\n\u00a0\nThe action is subtle but the damage has already been done. Kaveh drops his bag and it hits the floor with a wet  thud.  \u201cYou are! You\u2019re jealous and you\u2019re worried that I went and found a new roommate!\u201d\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham turns and mutters something to himself that sounds suspiciously like \u201cI would hardly attribute the jealousy to something as cursory as a roommate.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKaveh smiles guilefully, \u201cWhat was that, dear Scribe? I couldn\u2019t quite catch that.\u201d He can see the way that he\u2019s started to back the linguist into a corner. The high from potentially winning the argument just barely overshadows the growing feeling of butterflies fluttering in his ribcage. The implications of  something else  driving the jealousy has his heart doing flips.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s none of your concern.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI actually think that it\u2019s completely within the realm of my concern.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham  tsks , and redirects instead. \u201cYou\u2019re dripping water all over the floor, go change and mop up your mess.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you serious? You\u2019re just going to leave it at that? Tell me why you\u2019re jealous, Alhaitham.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Scribe doesn\u2019t even dignify him with a response. Instead, he snatches his book up off the table and resettles into the comfortable position he had before.\u00a0 He makes a big show out of opening the book to the page he had left off on and trained his eyes to move robotically over the words. Before Kaveh can get a word in edgewise, he\u2019s already reached up and cut off all auditory contact.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh no you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKaveh\u2019s heart races, because  this is it. This is the exact moment he had been waiting for.\n\u00a0\nHe unceremoniously lifts Alhaitham\u2019s legs up to make space to flop down onto the couch and grabs the book out of his hand. The Scribe starts to complain, both at the loss of his precious read, and also at the fact that Kaveh was getting water everywhere.\n\u00a0\nKaveh ignores him and instead chooses to yank Alhaitham into a sitting position. He makes sure that he\u2019s fully facing him when he signs,  \u201cI\u2019m not done talking to you.\u201d \n\u00a0\nAlhaitham\u2019s eyes widen in shock and he\u2019s pretty sure that\u2019s the most emotion he\u2019s ever seen on the man.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Apathetic\u2019 is the word that most people would use to describe Alhaitham. Kaveh knows better, that buried somewhere deep inside the unnecessary muscle and the bullheadedness is a sliver of something resembling a human being with emotions. He\u2019s never seen it himself, not when Alhaitham\u2019s grandmother had died, not when he had his first research project approved, not when he graduated from Haravatat, nor when he was promoted to Scribe.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s never experienced the full range of Alhaitham\u2019s emotions, but if he had to take a guess at what they looked like, it would be the image of Alhaitham now.\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s frozen on the spot, his kaleidoscopic eyes drowning in pure, unfettered shock, and his mouth slightly open, like his lips were chasing the words to say but couldn\u2019t quite catch them.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe looks so  human .\n\u00a0\nFor a moment, Kaveh worries that he messed up. He scoured his brain for grammatical errors, Tighnari had given him the stamp of approval to start signing with Alhaitham. He\u2019s not as fluent as he is verbally, but he knows enough to get his point across. \u2018Conversational,\u2019 Tighnari had dubbed him.\n\u00a0\n \u201cAlhaitham? Are you alright?\u201d he signs again.\n\u00a0\nStill no movement. Apprehension quickly mounting, he opts to wave in Alhaitham\u2019s face. \u201cHello..? Is anyone there?\u201d he calls out. He realizes belatedly that he couldn\u2019t hear, but he\u2019s sure that Alhaitham could read his lips.\n\u00a0\nThe lack of response (or any indication of life, really) was starting to stress Kaveh out and he began rambling, \u201cI know you can read my lips, Alhaitham. Was it insensitive of me to sign with you? I didn\u2019t mean to offend you if it was, I learned it just to keep quarreling with you, I didn\u2019t realize that it would cause such a reaction. I\u2019ll stop if you want me to\u2013\u2013\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo it again,\u201d Alhaitham whispers.\n\u00a0\nKaveh almost didn\u2019t catch it in his frantic apologies. \u201cHuh?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo it again,\u201d says Alhaitham; an emotion that Kaveh couldn\u2019t identify starting to color the edge of his words. \u201cSign again, please.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe complete turnaround has Kaveh reeling. Was he mad? It was hard to tell, but he hadn\u2019t tried to kill Kaveh yet, so perhaps not.\n\u00a0\nThat being said, he\u2019s not quite sure what to say, but the way Alhaitham is staring has him scrambling to find something to sign. He decides on the basics, and introduces himself.\n\u00a0\n\n \u201cHello. My name is K-A-V-E-H.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham drew a sharp breath, watching as Kaveh\u2019s fingers formed words familiar only to him. His face bears an unrestrained fascination, like he can\u2019t believe what he\u2019s seeing with his own eyes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKaveh had only signed five words, but he could tell that they meant millions more to the Scribe.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \u201cHello Ka\u2013\u201d  a sign that Kaveh didn\u2019t know yet followed the greeting. Alhaitham had reached up to his head and made a pinching motion, like he had pulled a feather from his scalp.\u00a0 It takes a few seconds for him to register that this must be the name that Alhaitham is giving him, and it probably refers to the quill he has sticking out of his hair. The action is so intimate that it nearly hurts. \u201c  My name is A-L-H-T-M.\u201d \n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s Kaveh\u2019s turn to be shy now, because all he can manage is a short, bashful wave. He\u2019s not quite sure what to say after that.\n\u00a0\nLucky for him, Alhaitham takes the initiative.  \u201cYou know SSL?\u201d he asks.\n\u00a0\n\n \u201cYes, Tighnari taught me.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n \u201cWhy?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n \u201cTo argue with you, obviously.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham barks out a laugh, reaching up to turn his hearing aids back on. \u201cOf course that would be why you learned it.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere\u2019s something guarded in his eyes, and Kaveh can feel the walls start to go back up. The short peek he had gotten at Alhaitham\u2019s soul was enough to have him addicted, and he would do anything to keep being exposed to it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the only reason,\u201d he blurts a little too quickly. His face flushed with embarrassment because he sounded so desperate. It was humiliating.\n\u00a0\nBut it\u2019s worth it. Alhaitham carefully eyes him, and Kaveh swallows his pride to admit quietly, \u201cI learned it because I wanted you to have someone to sign with. Even if you can speak just fine, I think you at least deserve the courtesy of having someone to converse with in your native tongue.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe admission feels like a declaration of his feelings. Nobody in their right mind would just learn another language to argue with their roommate. That type of commitment is reserved for a certain emotion. One he had been afraid to name, but it\u2019s hard to deny love when it\u2019s staring you in the face.\n\u00a0\nThe urge to escape is strong, but Kaveh forces himself to stay put, waiting for Alhaitham\u2019s response. He needs to know how he feels about Kaveh\u2019s near-confession.\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham only nods, processing the information.\u00a0 Kaveh can feel his spirit deflate. He had said too much.\n\u00a0\nAfter a moment, Alhaitham puts up another sign. This one is completely foreign to Kaveh, and he studies it carefully, trying to decipher it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham\u2019s hand was palm out, all fingers up, save for the middle and the ring, which were curled inward. It resembles the rock \u2018n roll symbol that he\u2019s seen the odd musician make here and there.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Kaveh asks.\n\u00a0\nA familiarly enigmatic smile makes a home on Alhaitham\u2019s lips. \u201cThat\u2019s a secret, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll figure it out one day.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe cryptic answer forces a huff out of Kaveh. Fine, if Alhaitham didn\u2019t want to tell him, he can keep his secrets. Kaveh respects privacy,  unlike a certain silver-haired Scribe. \n\u00a0\nHe thinks that\u2019s the end of it, and starts to get up to change out of his still-wet clothes. They were starting to stick uncomfortably to his skin, and the bodily chills he was starting to feel are getting unbearable. Just as he pries himself from the leather of the couch, Alhaitham grabs his wrist.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKaveh raises an eyebrow at him in question.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you a hint at what the sign means, if you\u2019ll let me.\u201d There was a hint of nervousness to be heard.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSate my curiosity, please.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham says nothing and stands up, moving into Kaveh\u2019s space. The proximity is disorienting, despite the fact that Kaveh had Alhaitham\u2019s legs draped over himself for the last 20 minutes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe can smell the scent of Kalpalata Lotuses and worn pages from this close, and it\u2019s hard not to be intoxicated.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKaveh worries that his heart is beating loud enough that the hearing aid would pick it up. \u201cYou\u2019re rather close for this explanation, Alhaitham. Is the translation so lucrative that you need to whisper it to me?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou talk too much,\u201d is all Alhaitham says before pressing his lips to Kaveh\u2019s. It effectively shuts him up.\n\u00a0\nHe was able to figure out what the sign meant after that.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLater, after Kaveh takes a warm bath and  finally  dons some warm clothes, Alhaitham beckons him to join him on the couch. Kaveh takes the opportunity to stretch out on top of the Scribe, slotting himself between the book in hand to lay his head on his chest. Kaveh relishes in the way one of Alhaitham\u2019s hands settles on his back.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI just have one request for you, Kaveh.\u201d The deep rumble is a novelty from this position.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat is it, \u2018Haitham?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cFor the love of all that is sacred, stop building your mock-up models in the middle of the night. Even when I take my hearing aids out, I swear I can still hear you hammering away in your room. I\u2019m going to kick you to the streets if you don\u2019t cut it out.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKaveh only laughs, pressing a placating kiss to Alhaitham\u2019s shoulder. \u201cCreativity waits for nobody, dear. I will try but I can\u2019t make any promises.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham rolls his eyes, but makes no move to argue further. If Kaveh can learn to sign for him, he can learn to listen.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham is deaf.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis is not a fact that he openly advertises to people. He hates the way that it changes their behavior after he tells them. They treat him like he\u2019s fragile, incapable of doing even the barest minimum on his own. He\u2019s  deaf,  not stupid.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe type of deafness he was born with is sensorineural hearing loss. It can result from aging, injury, disease, or genetic inheritance. In most cases, his included, it can\u2019t be medically or surgically treated. But to Alhaitham, it\u2019s just a fact of life; the sky is blue, the leaves are green, and he is deaf.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHis mind is sharp, and he\u2019s developed a few habits to circumvent his shortcomings: he learned Sumerian Sign Language, learned to read lips, and his grandmother created hearing aids for him. He even studied the mannerisms of hearing people so that he could act like them too.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSome may argue that doing all of this is a waste of his time and energy.  \u201cThere\u2019s no shame in being disabled!\u201d they would say. It\u2019s this exact phrase that causes his blood pressure to spike.\n\u00a0\nHe is not ashamed of being deaf. Quite the contrary, really. As one of the top Haravatat scholars, he\u2019s incredibly proud of himself for mastering over 30 languages, many of them spoken, even with his hearing loss. What he has an issue with, is how quickly his abilities are dismissed.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere\u2019s this common misconception that all disabled people are helpless. Alhaitham vehemently disagrees, but he digresses.\n\u00a0\nHe used to tell people that he was deaf upon meeting them, but there was always an underlying sense that they were holding back on him somehow. Like they believed that he couldn\u2019t handle whatever it was they were trying to offer him, all because he couldn\u2019t hear. Eventually, he got sick of it and just kept the fact that he was deaf to himself. His quality of life increased drastically after that.\n\u00a0\nTime and time again, he\u2019s noticed a distinct contrast in the way people will treat him before and after finding out that he\u2019s disabled. It almost makes him hate being deaf. To be clear, it\u2019s not his deafness that Alhaitham hates, but rather the incurable stupidity of the people around him.\n\u00a0\nThe point is, he makes the effort to keep up this well-guarded \u2018secret\u2019 of his because it just makes his day-to-day life easier. He can skip past the shallow pleasantries and the shifts in behavior if he acted like he was never deaf in the first place.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIf people manage to figure out that he\u2019s deaf, good for them, but he\u2019s not going to go out of his way to announce it to the world.\n\n\n\nThat being said, he is still human, and there have been times that he\u2019s screwed up. Mistakes are unavoidable, much to his chagrin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Mistake 1: Be sure to make eye contact when conversing with people. \n\n\n\n\nAlhaitham likes to catalog his mistakes to reflect and improve on at a future date. His motto is \u201cspending more time on contemplation and less time on execution.\u201d If he can pinpoint exactly what it is that went wrong the first time, it\u2019ll be a quick and easy fix for him later on.\n\u00a0\nHis first year at the Akademiya was rough for him. Being homeschooled for the first half of his life made the switch rather difficult, and he definitely had bumps along the way.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe most memorable for him was when he had argued with his professor, telling him that his class was a titanic waste of his time, and he would be better off doing some self-study at home. Naturally, the professor didn\u2019t take kindly to that, and he was dropped from the class immediately.\n\u00a0\nWord of that incident spread like wildfire, because, \u2018Who did this first year think he was, speaking to the Professor like that? The nerve!\u2019 \n\u00a0\n\n \u2018Honestly, the students get bolder and bolder every year. It\u2019s a wonder that he wasn\u2019t expunged for that behavior!\u2019 \n\n\u00a0\n\n \u2018A guy like that must be a nightmare to be around. If anything, I\u2019m glad that he\u2019s not in the class anymore.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\nFollowing the establishment of his reputation as a quick-tempered firecracker, Alhaitham found it difficult to connect with his peers. Many avoided him in fear of triggering an argument.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe didn\u2019t pay any mind to the baseless rumors. It\u2019s not his fault that the professor was a high-class idiot. If everyone else failed to see that, then they were probably of a similar caliber. He was more than content to wander the halls of the Akademiya by himself than to surround himself with bumbling fools.\n\u00a0\nEnter Kaveh, the bumbliest of fools.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s one of the few people who possessed the courage (or the stupidity) to approach him. It was a shift in Alhaitham\u2019s reality.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKaveh was an anomaly to Alhaitham. His mind is as keen as his own, but he put it towards something as arbitrary as architecture. He might have made a great Haravatat scholar if he had the patience to sit down and study for longer than three seconds.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKaveh had bounded into his life, always equipped with a bright smile and a rant that took up the better part of their lunch break. Alhaitham wasn\u2019t much of a conversationalist, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to tell Kaveh to leave him alone. There was something about the blonde that he found intriguing.\n\u00a0\nHe lets Kaveh go on his long tangents about his awful classmates and mind numbing assignments. Alhaitham would simply nod along, because it wasn\u2019t like he could get a word in with the stream of words that fell from Kaveh\u2019s mouth. It saved him the trouble of having to speak anyway, so it worked out in the end.\n\n\n\n\n\n(It\u2019s a bygone worry now, but back when he had first gotten his hearing aids, Alhaitham was acutely aware of the way his voice sounded when he spoke. He could never get his mouth to properly form the words the way he wanted to, and as a result, his speech ended up stilted and wrong-sounding from a lack of practice. It was easier to not speak than to try.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe eventually got the hang of it, if the numerous commendations he\u2019s received as a top Harvatat student are anything to go by, but he still prefers to keep his mouth shut in fear of stumbling over his words. This is a habit that he carries to this day.)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen they first met, Alhaitham believed that Kaveh\u2019s presence in his life was going to be temporary. He gave the architect the standard treatment that he gave everyone else: short, curt responses, and perhaps the time of day if he was in the mood. It unfortunately does nothing to deter him.\n\u00a0\nWhat he appreciates about Kaveh is that he is incredibly direct. Most of the people that Alhaitham encountered liked to beat around the bush in discussions. Kaveh was refreshingly blunt, it was nice to meet someone who could keep up with his own attitude.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBetter yet, Kaveh never comments on Alhaitham\u2019s self-imposed reticence. He never asks why Alhaitham prefers to listen over speaking. It results in a lot of one sided conversations that Kaveh carries, but Alhaitham wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\n\u00a0\nOnce he realizes that Kaveh is well and truly stuck to his side, Alhaitham allows himself to relax a little. He starts giving in to the bickering here and there, but more often than not, he just basks in his presence and maybe listens to the monologue of the day if the topic is interesting enough.\n\u00a0\nThat being said, his lack of participation in conversation left him with a lot of freedom to let his mind wander.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s only half focusing on the book in front of him, and he\u2019s even less focused on whatever praise Kaveh is spewing about Pardis Dhyai. It\u2019s probably the same as usual. The majority of his attention is on the way Kaveh looks particularly eye-catching today.\n\u00a0\n\u201c...I can\u2019t believe that something so beautiful could have been created. Surely it must have been a gift from the heavens,\u201d Kaveh says.\n\u00a0\n Couldn\u2019t have said it better myself, thinks Alhaitham privately. He\u2019s not referring to Pardis Dhyai.\n\u00a0\nIt takes all of his self restraint to not stare Kaveh down and take in the way his long golden hair flows past his shoulders. In the corner of his eye, he can spot the stubborn strand that wouldn\u2019t keep out of his face despite the intricate webbing of hairpins he had shoved into his head. It irks him. No one person should possess such a high level of aestheticism.\n\u00a0\nInstead, he makes sure that his eyes are perfectly focused on the pages in front of him, even if he retains none of it.\n\u00a0\nKaveh continues with his meaningless rabble, \u201cI have to meet the creator! I mean seriously, I have so many questions to ask. Like, how do you come up with such a beautiful vision? The execution was flawless\u2013\u2013\u201d\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham never really liked the way noise in general sounded. Perhaps it was a byproduct of being deaf, but hearing was never a part of his natural state of being. It was a foreign concept to him, and it was an overwhelming and distracting sensation at best. He would never be truly comfortable with it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHowever, Kaveh\u2019s voice had the perfect pitch and timbre. It was smooth and scratched his brain in a way that he couldn\u2019t quite describe. Every time he spoke, Alhaitham found himself scrambling to adjust the dials on his hearing aids to hear it better. Not that he would ever admit that aloud. If Kaveh caught wind of that, his ego would inflate to the size of the moon.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201c\u2013\u2013and the open air concept is truly reminiscent of a Nilotpala Lotus blossoming in the dead of night. A work of genius!\u201d\n\u00a0\nHis eyes do another perfunctory sweep of the paragraph that he is supposedly reading. He\u2019s not quite sure when he had started thinking about Kaveh like this, but it was embarrassing, to put it lightly.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nContrary to popular belief, Alhaitham is not a robot. Not that he cared for other people\u2019s opinions of him, but it should be known that he is capable of feeling emotion. Truly an inconvenience.\n\u00a0\nMore annoyingly, he feels, and he feels his emotions fiercely. It\u2019s like they\u2019re amplified by a factor of five with the loss of his hearing.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s been less than a year since they met, but Alhaitham already can\u2019t imagine his life without Kaveh. It\u2019s a depressingly pathetic realization. Was he truly so lonely that he felt the need to latch onto the first person he met?\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s so lost in thought that he misses the first four times that Kaveh had called his name. It\u2019s only by a miracle that he manages to catch the fifth.\n\u00a0\n\u201c...Alhaitham? Damn it, Alhaitham, look at me when I\u2019m talking to you! Are you even listening to me?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s shaken out of his musing by the tone of Kaveh\u2019s voice. It shook dangerously, and his face twisted into an expression of intense displeasure.\n\u00a0\nOh. He is  pissed. \n\u00a0\nAlhaitham\u2019s spine stiffens. The words are heartbreakingly familiar and remind him of his childhood \u2013\u2013 pre diagnosis \u2013\u2013 when his parents would beg him to just  listen,  but he literally  couldn\u2019t. The admonition makes him irrationally angry. Not at Kaveh, but at himself.\n\u00a0\nFor the better part of his life, Alhaitham didn\u2019t have any speaking people in his inner circle. His primary form of communication was through SSL. Naturally, his eyes were drawn to a person\u2019s hands, rather than their eyes. Sure, there was the component of expressions in SSL, but most of the importance was placed on the hand signs.\n\u00a0\nThis minute detail is something that he would later learn to be wildly different in spoken conversations. It was something that his grandmother had stressed to him to fix whenever speaking with someone.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \"Eye contact is important, it lets the other person know that you are listening.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s been so long since he\u2019s slipped up. He\u2019s supposed to have perfected the art of blending in. His grip on the leatherbound tightens and he tries not to slap himself for his carelessness.\n\u00a0\nA part of him wishes that he could just come clean about his deafness. He\u2019s just afraid of fundamentally changing Kaveh in a way that is irreversible. He likes the bickering that comes along with the blonde; it fills him with the strange feeling of being accepted. Now he\u2019s gone and messed it all up.\n\u00a0\nKaveh at least has the decency to look guilty. Immediately following his outburst, he opens his mouth to apologize before deciding against it. His eyes are downturned as he begins to quickly gather his drafts and sticks of charcoal to shove into his bag.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHis brain finally kicks into gear and he stops Kaveh just as he\u2019s about to close the top of his knapsack. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\n\n\nKaveh looks dumbfounded. \u201cI, uh.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\n What is it that they were talking about again?\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0\nIn an attempt to cover his tracks, he repeats whatever prose he managed to catch in a mockery of Kaveh\u2019s voice.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe blonde flushes a pretty red, and indignantly cries, \u201cI do  not  sound like that!\u201d\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham tries to ignore the way his heart stutters at the sight. He resettles in his chair, making sure to face Kaveh this time. \u201cHad me fooled,\u201d he drawls, \u201cBut do go on.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe dodges the stub of charcoal that comes flying his way and learns all about the ingenuity associated with Pardis Dhyai.\n\u00a0\nWhether he was focused on Kaveh\u2019s lips to read them or for some other mysterious reason is anyone\u2019s guess.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Mistake 2: He must keep his hands still at all costs. \n\n\n\n\nHis interest in Kaveh wavered once he realized how annoyingly perceptive the architect is. Many people have described Alhaitham as observant, but his own habits are dwarfed by Kaveh\u2019s watchful eye.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham has a habit of signing to himself, this is a fact he knows. It\u2019s one of the few things that he can\u2019t conceal about being deaf. Asking himself not to sign is like asking Kaveh to not run his mouth. An absurd idea, and near-impossible to properly execute.\n\u00a0\nHe sees the way Kaveh's eyes catch his fingertips. Alhaitham feeds him some bullshit lies about crossing his arms being an intimidation tactic. It\u2019s a flimsy diversion, but Kaveh takes it at face value, though not without a snide comment about his physique.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn reality, physical restraint is the only way he can stop himself from signing. If distracting Kaveh with his  \u2018infuriatingly beefy arms\u2019  would get him to stop asking questions about his unconscious signing, then so be it.\n\u00a0\n(He tries not to laugh at the description. Why it mattered to Kaveh whether or not he worked out was beyond him. He just wanted to stay in the prime of his health is all. However, he always loved to provoke the architect and would never pass up the opportunity to bicker.)\n\n\n\n\n\nAlhaitham\u2019s indulging in a riveting book on some ancient runes found in the Hypostyle Desert when he feels Kaveh\u2019s resentful gaze from somewhere beside him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your problem now?\u201d he asks.\n\u00a0\nKaveh huffs and narrows his eyes at him. \u201cIt just pisses me off.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAh, yes.  \u2018It.\u2019  How incredibly descriptive and insightful of you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKaveh continues as if he hadn\u2019t heard, \u201cAs a Scribe, what do you need all of this brute strength for? Lifting 60 textbooks at once? Perhaps you need the insurmountable brawn to move your pen across the signature line on all your approval forms.  \u2018Feeble scholar,\u2019 my ass.\u201d\n\u00a0\nA small smirk finds its way to Alhaitham\u2019s face. \u201cDo you want to know why I need this  \u2018brute strength ?\u2019\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cEnlighten me, O knowledgeable one.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s to pick up all of the slack you leave around here. The dishes won\u2019t do themselves, you know,\u201d he answers flippantly.\n\u00a0\nHe doesn\u2019t even bat an eyelash at Kaveh\u2019s affronted gasp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Mistake(?) 3: He must never forget his hearing aid anywhere. Ever. \n\n\n\n\nThis is a no-brainer. Obviously Alhaitham should carry his hearing aids around for the fact that he is deaf.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWere she still on the face of Teyvat, he\u2019s sure that his grandmother would give him a lengthy lecture about the dangers of being taken advantage of while having his hearing impaired.\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019ll be fine, thank you very much.\n\u00a0\nAlong with them being a necessary tool for him to facilitate his daily life, the hearing aids are his most damning piece of evidence. It\u2019s obvious that Alhaitham has to conceal them, because they\u2019re practically a sign glued to the side of his head that reads:  Hey! Look at me, I\u2019m deaf! \n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not as though he couldn\u2019t function without them. He was perfectly capable of going through his day without his hearing aids, but it\u2019s more of a minor setback.\n\u00a0\nHe can\u2019t be stupid and just leave them lying around anywhere for Kaveh to find. The man is a Kshahrewar graduate. With that infuriatingly bright mind of his, he\u2019d be able to recognize them for what they were at a glance.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s somewhat of a moot point now, seeing that Kaveh lives with him and he was bound to find out at some point, but Alhaitham was too deep into this charade. It\u2019s not any more skin off his back to remember to wear his hearing aids anyway, but it still paid to be precautious.\n\u00a0\nFor the most part, he wore his hearing aids for the duration of the entire day. He only took them off whenever he had to take a shower or when he was going to sleep. He used to take them off whenever he got home, but he had to stop doing that once Kaveh moved in since he has a habit of knocking on Alhaitham\u2019s door to ask him inane questions.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere is exactly one instance where he forgot to take them with him:\n\n\n\n\nAlhaitham was up late the previous night finishing up some thesis approval forms for the Akademiya. As a result, he woke up a little late and had to rush through his morning routine. He jumped up from his bed and straight into the shower.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe furiously scrubbed at his face and ran the shampoo through his hair. He moved so quickly that he\u2019s worried that there would be a clump of suds still in his gray locks. He snatches the towel off the rack, pats himself dry and blindly reaches along the countertop, searching for his hearing aids to put on while he brushes his teeth.\n\u00a0\nHe swears once he realizes that in his haste, he left them on his nightstand, along with the clothes that he was going to change into.\n\u00a0\nNo matter, his room was right across the hall from the bathroom anyway, so he\u2019ll just slip past Kaveh without him knowing.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe ties the towel around his waist, bundles up his now discarded sleep clothes, and steps out into the hallway.\n\u00a0\nWhen he opens the door, a familiar head of messy blonde hair enters his field of view. His hair is mussed with sleep and the warm morning light caused his skin to glow beautifully.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0He hadn\u2019t heard him walking up, and Alhaitham hopes to Celestia that he doesn\u2019t notice that he\u2019s not wearing his hearing aids.\n\u00a0\nKaveh\u2019s eyes widen and his mouth drops open. Alhaitham takes note of the way his pupils move over his bare skin, and how a hint of red flooded his ears. After a moment, his roommate whips around to give him some semblance of privacy.\n\u00a0\nIn the dim lamplight, he can see Kaveh mumbling something about indecency and how there are other people living in his house and he has to bite back the urge to remind the architect exactly who owns the place.\n\n\nInstead, he fights down the grin from realizing that Kaveh was  flustered  at his state of undress before shuffling back into his room, thanking the Archons that he hadn\u2019t noticed that Alhaitham couldn\u2019t hear a damn thing he\u2019s saying.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Mistake 4: Asking Kaveh to move in with him. \n\n\n\n\nWhile unrelated to his hearing problem, Alhaitham is sure that his greatest mistake was offering Kaveh a place to stay.\n\u00a0\nBefore he moved in, Alhaitham\u2019s home was a peaceful sanctuary. He had the freedom to leave his books wherever he pleased; he had the mora in his pockets to do whatever he wanted with.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd quiet. His house used to be so blessedly quiet.\n\u00a0\n(Every time Kaveh comes home, Alhaitham immediately reaches up to turn down the volume of his hearing aids. It\u2019s for the sake of his sanity.)\n\u00a0\nWhen he extended the offer, Alhaitham was under the impression that Kaveh would keep mostly to himself until he could get back on his own two feet. He was not expecting such an\u2026 eccentric roommate.\n\u00a0\nHe should have known better. Kaveh\u2019s presence was bold and boisterous, even when the man was down on his luck and had a total of three mora to his name. He leads his life without any plan or direction, and lets whimsy guide his way. It is the antithesis to all of Alhaitham\u2019s life principles, and it drives him insane.\n\u00a0\nThe result is the two of them constantly being at odds with one another.\n\u00a0\nNow, he has to listen to Kaveh\u2019s constant nagging about putting his books back on the proper shelves and his bitching about Alhaitham\u2019s allegedly horrible taste in furniture.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe has to make space for the endless rolls of drafting paper and the hundreds of cups filled with all manner of pens, quills, and compasses.\n\u00a0\nThe Scribe\u2019s wallet aches every time they hit the tavern and Kaveh manages to swindle him into paying off the bar tab. And as the icing on the cake, after paying, he has to drag the dramatic idiot back to their house because he got so wasted that he couldn\u2019t walk straight.\n\u00a0\nAnd then there was the fact that Kaveh was  constantly  aware of him and everything he did.\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham isn\u2019t sure if it\u2019s just part of the architect\u2019s considerate nature, or if he possesses some freakish, prophetic power, but he always remembers every last one of Alhaitham\u2019s quirks. It was kind of scary, how much Kaveh noticed.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019ll always get a snarky remark about the way his black coffee will send him to an early grave, or how he\u2019s doomed to shriveling into a shrimp if he keeps up his awful posture while reading. Once, Kaveh noted that he always balances one leg on his thigh whenever he\u2019s focused on something, and Alhaitham was acutely conscious of it in the days following.\n\u00a0\nThere are other peculiar things that Kaveh decides to file away in that strange, strange brain of his. For example, he remembers that one time Alhaitham had offhandedly mentioned wanting to buy a specific collector\u2019s edition of one of his dictionaries.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not a necessity, so Alhaitham totally forgets about it. It\u2019s not until a few months later that Kaveh comes home one day, book in hand, and drops it on the desk in front of Alhaitham.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\n\u00a0\nKaveh shoots him a look. \u201cIt\u2019s that one book you wouldn\u2019t stop talking about getting. I saw it at one of the booths in the market today and got it for you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nFirst of all, Alhaitham mentioned it  once. It was over some wine during a late night at the tavern. Alhaitham barely recalls this conversation himself.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHow he manages to remember all of these minute details is a mystery to Alhaitham. He thinks that Kaveh could use the mental capacity to remember more important things, like paying his rent on time, or not blowing his entire paycheck on silly keychains that are obviously a scam and not some sort of meal package for orphaned children.\n\u00a0\nThe clothbound cover is as beautiful as he remembers, and it must have cost quite the pretty mora.\n\u00a0\nStill\u2026\n\u00a0\n\u201cI appreciate the gesture, but I hope you know that it doesn\u2019t exempt you from rent this month.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThat comment earns him a swiftly-placed punch to the arm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s not all bad, though. After a while, Alhaitham learns to side-step the rolls of paper dangling precariously off one of the desks so as not to knock it over. His boots find a place on the rack next to the white and gold flats near the door.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe learns to put up with the hideous choice of curtains that Kaveh had begged him to buy, and he remembers to start putting out two plates instead of one. He\u2019s gotten used to the habit of pouring two cups of coffee and the sight of the extra bottles of soap in the bathroom. Everywhere he looked, there was a piece of Kaveh.\n\u00a0\nHe starts to look forward to Kaveh patting his pockets down in the morning, double, triple, and quadruple checking that he remembered to bring his keys, lest Alhaitham take them by \u2018accident\u2019 again.\n\u00a0\nThe slightly askew painting in the hallway suddenly doesn\u2019t bother him that much anymore, and he even anticipates the heated screaming matches they get into that end with him turning his hearing aids off for some peace and quiet.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe grew to like the domesticity of it all.\n\u00a0\nThat is, until Kaveh suddenly started disappearing every weekend.\n\u00a0\nAt first, Alhaitham didn\u2019t think much of it. If anything, he was glad that he finally had some time to himself. Kaveh always tells him that he has a place to stay, and to not expect him back for a few days. In response, Alhaitham indulges in leaving his books strewn all over the floor and takes the opportunity to walk around the house without his hearing aids on.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTrue to his word, Kaveh is gone Friday evening, and back by Monday morning. Wherever it is that he goes has changed him, because Alhaitham notes that he engages in far less squabble and bickering than before. It\u2019s hard to offer anything past a quick greeting because he\u2019s gone before Alhaitham can say much else.\n\u00a0\nHe decides to investigate after Kaveh stumbles in well after midnight one night, shrouded in a secrecy that Alhaitham couldn\u2019t quite crack.\n\u00a0\n\u2026He missed his roommate, alright? Shame on him for wanting to spend a little more time together.\n\u00a0\nKaveh could only use the excuse of going out to the tavern so many times before Alhaitham suspected that he was a budding alcoholic.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe begins asking around for Kaveh\u2019s whereabouts, starting with Lambad\u2019s tavern, because that\u2019s the excuse Kaveh gives most often.\n\u00a0\n\u201cKaveh? I haven\u2019t seen him around here in a while. He mentioned something about a project that he was working on, but beyond that, he didn\u2019t say anything else.\u201d\n\u00a0\nFrom there, he goes to Kaveh\u2019s superior and asks for any information about his ongoing projects. He\u2019s nearly laughed out the door when the superior revealed that Kaveh hadn\u2019t been scheduled for anything in a few weeks.\n\u00a0\nThe rest of his search continues similarly, and the weeks pass of Alhaitham going on this wild goose chase to find out the truth of his roommate\u2019s secret nightlife.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s about to give up when he gets his answer in a passing comment from Cyno.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTell your roommate to go home on the weekends. I\u2019m sick of listening to Tighnari griping about him.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham\u2019s head whips around. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u00a0\nCyno looks like he wants to whack Alhaitham on the head with his staff. \u201cKaveh,\u201d he deadpans, \u201cThe one who has been catching rides to Gandharva Ville every weekend.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham has a similar idea with the sword strapped to his back. It would be so easy to just butt the General in the head with the hilt of his blade. \u201cNot sure if you\u2019ve noticed, but we haven\u2019t necessarily been around each other as of late. He\u2019s been disappearing under my nose and refuses to tell me where he goes,\u201d he grits out.\n\u00a0\nCyno shrugs, \u201cWhatever, just tell him to get his act together. If I have to hear Tighnari say one more thing about his attitude, I\u2019m going to blow a fuse.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not his  handler. \u201d\n\u00a0\nCyno eyes him, \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019ll be doing us both a favor if you manage to rein him in.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham shoots Cyno a particularly rude gesture before stalking off to send a message to Gandharva Ville.\n\u00a0\n\u2018 Why is Kaveh at your house all the time?\u2019 he writes.\n\u00a0\nTighnari\u2019s response comes quickly, but is irritatingly vague and concise:\n\u00a0\n\n \u2018That is not information I can divulge. Perhaps you should just ask him yourself.\u2019 \n\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham crumples the note and tries not to throw one of the ugly vases that Kaveh bought with his money.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nIt all comes to a head on a particularly rainy evening.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham is stretched out on the couch, hearing aids tuned to the max to hear Kaveh\u2019s footsteps through the drumming of the rain. He tries to pick up a book to pass the time, but he can\u2019t focus on anything other than his roommate and his frequent late-night rendezvous with Tighnari.\n\u00a0\nHad Alhaitham offended Kaveh so egregiously that he felt the need to storm out and seek shelter elsewhere? He\u2019ll admit that he did deliver some biting snipes recently, but it wasn't anything unusual for them.\n\u00a0\nMaybe he\u2019s finally moving out. The idea makes him snort, because there was no way that Kaveh could bear to part with all of the touches he added to their shared space.\n\u00a0\n\u2026Or perhaps he and Tighnari have some sort of ongoing fling. That\u2019s a revelation and a half. He thinks back to Cyno\u2019s comment about solving a problem for both of them.\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s kind of mad that Kaveh is avoiding talking to him directly. He\u2019d appreciate some sort of heads up. He doesn\u2019t mind that Kaveh is pursuing romantic endeavors; he is his own person. He\u2019s just \u2026hurt that he doesn\u2019t trust Alhaitham enough to tell him about it. They were friends, were they not? He could take it.\n\u00a0\n(He ignores the way his heart twists in his chest at the idea of Tighnari and Kaveh together.)\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s about to entertain the possibility of Kaveh suddenly developing a vested interest in becoming a forest ranger when the man of the hour stumbles through the front door.\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham chances a peek over the top of his book to assess Kaveh\u2019s state and wow, he looks awful.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHis blonde hair was slicked back from the rain, and his overnight bag hung limply from his shoulder. His chest heaved with exertion beneath his soaked shirt. He must have run all the way back home. He resembles something like a wet cat.\n\u00a0\n A very attractive wet cat,  his mind supplies helpfully.\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham pretends to focus on his book. \u201cFun night out on the town?\u201d he asks.\n\u00a0\nKaveh only sighs, \u201cCould we not do this right now? I\u2019m tired and I have a proposal meeting tomorrow.\u201d Again with the vague, deflective answers.\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham refuses to give up so easily. \u201cNot until you tell me where you\u2019ve been going on the weekends.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKaveh shucks his shoes and moves to their linen closet for a towel. \u201cWhat are you, my dad?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHardly,\u201d Alhaitham says as he fiddles with another page, \u201cTechnically speaking, I\u2019m your landlord, and as one of my tenants, I should be allowed to know where you\u2019ve been.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re both adults, am I not allowed the right to privacy?\u201d\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham\u2019s jaw tightens considerably. Leave it to Kaveh to put words in his mouth. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I said, I was simply asking where you\u2019ve been.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKaveh narrows his eyes at him. \u201cWhy does it matter to you, anyway? As far as I was aware, you wanted me out of your house as soon as possible.\u201d\n\u00a0\nYet another lie, but Alhaitham is not going to give Kaveh the satisfaction of telling him that, so he does the most logical thing instead: antagonize him further. \u201cNo need to get defensive,\u201d he clips, \u201cI was just asking where you go on the weekends. You\u2019re out so often that I\u2019m wondering if you even get the full worth of your rent money.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKaveh\u2019s jaw drops open. \u201cWhat is that supposed to mean?\u201d\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham shuts the book in hand with a bit more force than is necessary and tosses it on the table. \u201cI just simply meant that if you found yourself a place to stay, there\u2019s no point in paying rent here anymore, hm? From the looks of it, you and Tighnari have been getting on swimmingly in Gandharva Ville.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThat breaks the dam, and Kaveh makes a noise of disbelief. \u201cTighnari\u2013 What does he have to do with any of this? How did you even know about that? I never even told you where I was going?!\u201d\n\u00a0\nA self-satisfactory bolt shoots through Alhaitham. There was his confirmation that he and Tighnari were convening. Then, he realizes that he had just incriminated himself.\n\u00a0\nHe purses his lips. \u201cI have my sources\u2013\u2013\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo your sources include an abuse of diplomatic power?\u201d Kaveh scoffs.\n\u00a0\n\u201c\u2013\u2013and I found by asking around that you had been regularly asking to hitch caravan rides out of the city to visit a certain Amurta graduate. If I wasn\u2019t looking at you with my own eyes, I might have believed that you were seeking private treatment from him for a hidden ailment. But I think something more personal is afoot.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham can literally see the gears turning in Kaveh\u2019s brain. The architect attempts to shake off the confusion and flings water everywhere. \u201cOkay, wait, wait. Now I\u2019m lost. Care to elaborate? Since you seem to have the whole situation figured out?\u201d he asks. His sharp red eyes scrutinize Alhaitham, as if searching for some sort of explanation in his face.\n\u00a0\n\u2026He appears to have miscalculated.\n\u00a0\nKaveh tongues his cheek, \u201cOh, now you\u2019ve got nothing to say? You seemed to be filled with quips when you were accusing me of  being a homewrecker!\u201d He all but shrieks.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say that you were a homewrecker, those words came out of your own mouth,\u201d Alhaitham replies pettily.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSteam practically blows out of Kaveh\u2019s ears. \u201cI\u2019m not seeing Tighnari romantically! Archons, Alhaitham, what is your deal? It\u2019s almost like you care about who I\u2019m seeing\u2013\u2013\u201d\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham scoffs. Of course he cares. He doesn\u2019t let  just anyone  invade his personal space like he does Kaveh.\n\u00a0\nThe noise causes Kaveh to whip around, when another revelation strikes him. He laughs incredulously as he asks, \u201cAre you jealous?\u201d\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham avoids his gaze.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe can hear the shocked gasp and the thud of his bag as it hits the floor.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou are! You\u2019re jealous and you\u2019re worried that I went and found a new roommate!\u201d Kaveh points out accusatorily.\n\n\nAlhaitham huffs, muttering under his breath, \u201cI would hardly attribute the jealousy to something as cursory as a roommate.\u201d Kaveh couldn\u2019t see, but under the headset, Alhaitham\u2019s ears burned an embarrassed red. How could he have been so careless? He supposes that Kaveh just had that sort of effect on him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt only entertains Kaveh further. \u201cWhat was that, dear Scribe? I couldn\u2019t quite catch that.\u201d The look on his face tells Alhaitham that he\u2019s reached a conclusion, one that he probably won\u2019t like.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s none of your concern,\u201d he deflects.\n\u00a0\nKaveh dons a stupidly smug grin. \u201cI actually think that it\u2019s completely within the realm of my concern.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham  tsks,  and changes topic. \u201cYou\u2019re dripping water all over the floor, go change and mop up your mess,\u201d he says.  You\u2019ll catch a cold in those clothes,  he doesn\u2019t say.\n\n\nNaturally, Kaveh ignores him. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d he asks, \u201cYou\u2019re just going to leave it at that? Tell me why you\u2019re jealous, Alhaitham.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham doesn\u2019t even deign to respond to him. Instead, he snatches his book up off the table and resumes his comfortable position from before.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe forces himself to stare at the book in front of him and at the book only. He fears that if he makes eye contact with Kaveh, his carefully constructed facade would crumble in an instant. Logically, he knows that this makeshift wall of his equates to less than a shattered window, but he couldn\u2019t possibly hope to confront his feelings at this exact moment.\n\u00a0\nThe whole thing is becoming too much for Alhaitham, and he takes the only out he has. He reaches up to his hearing aids and turns them off. The ensuing silence is a frail shield.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn his peripheral vision, he can see the way Kaveh is shouting expletives at him. He thanks the Archons for modern technology, because he can\u2019t hear him. He can definitely read his lips, though. He wants to smirk at the  \u2018You are such an infantile bastard!\u2019  but he\u2019s deliberately ignoring the architect in hopes that he\u2019ll just give up and leave like he always does.\n\u00a0\nKaveh has never been one to adhere to his expectations, and unfortunately, that\u2019s what Alhaitham loves about him.\n\u00a0\nHe does not appreciate the fact that Alhaitham muted him. He glowers at Alhaitham before saying something that the Scribe couldn\u2019t quite catch.\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham starts to get invested in his paragraph when he feels Kaveh lift his legs and plop down beside him. If he thought that sitting there would bother Alhaitham, then he had another thing coming for him. No matter, he\u2019ll just have to keep up the impassive attitude.\n\u00a0\nKaveh\u2019s palms suddenly take over his vision, and his precious book is torn from his hands. He makes a noise of complaint because Kaveh was still dripping from the rain and he could smudge the ink on the pages.\n\u00a0\nThen, a hand tangles itself in his shirt and yanks him upright. He\u2019s about to reprimand Kaveh, since it was his favorite shirt, but is immediately met with the sight of Kaveh signing.\n\u00a0\nHis roommate. Signing. In SSL.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \u201cI\u2019m not done talking to you.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham\u2019s eyes blow wide with surprise.\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham\u2019s brain is well and truly scrambled. He\u2019s never explicitly told anyone that he\u2019s deaf simply because he doesn\u2019t take pity or handouts. All of his accomplishments will come from his own hard work, not just because the people around him decided that he was  defective,  and called for misplaced charity. He doesn\u2019t need accommodations, nor does he need people to accommodate him.\n\u00a0\nAnd yet, here Kaveh is, signing to him. He\u2019s decent at it too, based on what he\u2019s seen so far.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHow did he even know that Alhaitham was deaf? Who did he learn SSL from? Because he certainly didn\u2019t know any last time he checked. And more importantly,  why did he learn it? Could it have been for him?\n\u00a0\nHe dares not to entertain that last idea, lest his hunch be wrong, but in his heart of hearts, he really hopes that it\u2019s true.\n\u00a0\n\n \u201cAlhaitham? Are you alright?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\nHe genuinely cannot wrap his brain around the fact that Kaveh is signing to him. His heart swells painfully because of it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe hasn\u2019t said a word, and that sends Kaveh into a nervous spiral. \u201cI know you can read my lips, Alhaitham. Was it insensitive of me to sign with you? I didn\u2019t mean to offend you if it was, I learned it just to keep quarreling with you, I didn\u2019t realize that it would cause such a reaction. I\u2019ll stop if you want me to\u2013\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe speed and amount of words that came tumbling out of Kaveh\u2019s mouth became too much for Alhaitham to keep up with. He could catch a lot of apologies in the spiel, but he decided to ignore them to make a request instead.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo it again,\u201d he whispers.\n\u00a0\nKaveh is thrown off course. \u201cHuh?\u201d\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham hopes that his voice doesn\u2019t sound too strained when he repeats, \u201cDo it again. Sign again, please.\u201d He needs to make sure that he isn't dreaming.\n\u00a0\nKaveh stares at him like had grown three heads, but he acquiesces anyway. He thinks about what to sign for a second before,\n\u00a0\n \u201cHello. My name is K-A-V-E-H.\u201d Kaveh\u2019s sharp red eyes are hard with concentration, and his brow furrows slightly. He looks so focused on his task and Alhaitham is struggling to not crack at how endearing it is.\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham draws a sharp breath. The crazy bastard actually went and did it. He learned Sumerian Sign Language.\u00a0 He can\u2019t tear his eyes away from Kaveh\u2019s hands. He hasn\u2019t signed with anyone else in a long time, and it\u2019s strange to see the words that only he and his family had been familiar with.\n\u00a0\nHis hands move on their own. \u201cHello, Ka-veh.\u201d He came up with the sign name for the architect a long time ago, and of the many that he\u2019s given, it\u2019s probably his favorite. It highlights the beautiful, blue quill that he has nested in his blonde mane. It\u2019s probably far too personal for something as ordinary as a name, but hopefully Kaveh wouldn\u2019t catch onto the nuance. Alhaitham thinks that he wouldn\u2019t mind if Kaveh did. \u201cMy name is A-L-H-T-M.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKaveh manages a meek wave.\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham\u2019s curiosity will always get the best of him, so he asks,  \u201cYou know SSL?\u201d \n\u00a0\n\n \u201cYes, Tighnari taught me.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\nWell, that explains the frequent weekends out, but he still doesn\u2019t get the other thing.\n\u00a0\n \u201cWhy?\u201d What was the point of learning a language that nobody knew? A bubble of hope rises in his chest. Selfishly, he hopes that his hunch is true.\n\u00a0\n\n \u201cTo argue with you, obviously.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham barks out a laugh, because what else can he do? He reaches up to turn his hearing aids back on. \u201cOf course that would be why you learned it,\u201d he says, his tone coming off plainly.\n\u00a0\nHe had been a fool for believing that Kaveh would go to such lengths because he  cared about him. It was rather obvious that his roommate didn\u2019t like him or his personality, so of course the hatred would fuel him enough to learn SSL just to argue with him.\n\u00a0\nThe response is so perfectly Kaveh that he can\u2019t even be mad.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStill, it breaks Alhaitham\u2019s heart.\n\u00a0\nHe schools his face into something decidedly less miserable and begins to pull back. They were suddenly far too close for his liking, and his poor soul couldn\u2019t take it.\n\u00a0\nHe slowly swings his legs off of Kaveh\u2019s lap and places them on the floor. He sits up and attempts to hide the stiffness in shoulders. He can\u2019t stand to look Kaveh in the eyes right now, so he turns away.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the only reason,\u201d blurts Kaveh.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThat gets his attention, and he returns his gaze to Kaveh, albeit a bit guardedly. He can\u2019t afford to let himself down any more than he already had.\n\u00a0\nHis stare pierces through the man, and Kaveh swallows nervously. His cheeks are tinged with a light pink as he admits quietly, \u201cI learned it because I wanted you to have someone to sign with. Even if you can speak just fine, I think you at least deserve the courtesy of having someone to converse with in your native tongue.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThat\u2026 is so sweet. Alhaitham is incredibly touched by the gesture, and he doesn\u2019t have the words to convey that, so he goes with the next best thing.\n\u00a0\nHe uses this sign sparingly, reserved for only the most cherished people in his life. His fingers curl around the word  \u201cI-L-Y.\u201d \n\u00a0\nApparently, Tighnari hadn\u2019t taught Kaveh this one yet, because Kaveh cocks his head slightly, trying to figure it out. Another squeeze to Alhaitham\u2019s heart.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham feels himself smile. \u201cThat\u2019s a secret, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll figure it out one day.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKaveh huffs at the answer, but doesn\u2019t press any further, seemingly respecting his choice to keep it to himself.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham was expecting more of a fight, so he grabs Kaveh\u2019s wrist as he gets up to change. He feels bad for making him suffer through the wet clothes for a little longer, but he needs Kaveh to understand what he\u2019s trying to say.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you a hint at what the sign means,\u201d he says, before quickly tacking on, \u201cIf you\u2019ll let me.\u201d The possibility of rejection is terrifyingly real.\n\u00a0\nKaveh\u2019s gaze softened considerably. \u201cSate my curiosity, please.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham\u2019s heart thumps dangerously in his chest. He\u2019s worried that Kaveh would be able to hear it as he steps into Kaveh\u2019s space. From here, he can count every last mole and eyelash. He wants to look forever.\n\u00a0\nThe blonde is equally as jittery, and it shows when he asks, \u201cYou\u2019re rather close for this explanation, Alhaitham. Is the translation so lucrative that you need to whisper it to me?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe really wants to kiss Kaveh now, so he says, \u201cYou talk too much,\u201d before leaning in.\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham loves the way Kaveh smiles against his lips when it clicks in his head.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTighnari eyes them dubiously from across the table. \u201cIs it finally over? I find it hard to believe that you guys are actually together now.\u201d\n\u00a0\nCyno holds a similar sentiment. \u201cYou\u2019re not acting any differently than you normally do. You two aren\u2019t even sitting next to each other.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAlhaitham doesn\u2019t look up from the cards in his hand. \u201cThat\u2019s because Kaveh cheats. He likes to look at my deck.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKaveh gasps offendedly. \u201cThat is not true! I will not have you tarnishing my reputation like this!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYour reputation as a dirty, lying cheat?\u201d\n\u00a0\nKaveh puts up a rather rude gesture, and Alhaitham smirks down at his hand. \u201cThat\u2019s not actually a word in SSL, Kaveh.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTighnari groans, and Cyno reaches over to pat him on the back. There\u2019s really no putting a stop to their bickering, but he\u2019s happy for them at least.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0"
