    "text": "\nMost of the members of the recently formed Justice League believe that Batman has no sense of humor. Superman, who had known The Bat for years prior, insists he does; it\u2019s just a wicked, dry, sarcastic sense of humor. Flash and Green Lantern constantly argue that they would have witnessed a joke by now if that was the case. Green Lantern and Green Arrow have agreed he was born a sour-puss, but Flash has come to the conclusion the Joker had something to do with his no-jokes-allowed sensibility. Any time the topic is brought up around Wonder Woman, she is quick to squash it, stating: \u201cIt is none of their business\u201d and to leave Batman alone.\u00a0\n\n\nBatman, of course, does have a sense of humor. And he finds it very funny to annoy and tease his new teammates. A particularly fun method he found is utilizing his civilian identity.\u00a0\n\n\nAnytime Brucie Wayne is brought up, he is sure to be present to insert some scathing comment: from calling himself \u201ca vapid trust fund baby that never grew up\u201d to \u201ca floozy with minimal brain function whose child runs his company\u201d. These comments in themselves are fun to make, but the others\u2019 reactions are what\u2019s really so funny.\u00a0\n\n\nThey have all been known to interject a disagreement over Brucie Wayne\u2019s character. Oliver never fails to step in to try to defend his friend\u2019s honor, but in an effort to conceal how exactly he knows Bruce Wayne, he usually ends up floundering and accidentally insulting Bruce. Clark always gives his usual disapproving look and chimes in with something along the lines of: \u201cI know how he is often spoken about in the media, but I\u2019ve met him on a few occasions and he\u2019s really not like that.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n(It\u2019s also funny to watch Clark trying to avoid outing himself as a reporter, as his high regard for Bruce Wayne stems from an interview where Bruce \n\ndid \n\nflirt with Clark relentlessly but also went into great detail on the dozens of Wayne Enterprise projects helping to rebuild Gotham into a better city \u2013 Clark wrote a very flattering article following that interview.)\u00a0\n\n\nFlash pushed one day, \u201cWhy are you always defending him, Supes? Do you\u2013 oh my god, do you have a crush?\u201d He manages to work \u2018crush\u2019 into a two syllable word.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWhat, no!\u201d Superman responds, in a panic, far too quickly, \u201cHe\u2019s just\u2026 Look, Bruce Wayne has done a ton of stuff for Gotham: his company has built orphanages, and schools, and hospitals. He\u2019s created dozens of care-programs, renovating housing and public buildings and creating scholarships for kids who wouldn\u2019t have even graduated highschool otherwise. And\u2026 and he\u2019s just really\u2026 selfless.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThat got a chuckle from nearly everyone listening.\u00a0\n\n\nSuperman huffs, then continues, \u201cI\u2019m serious! There was this one time, he was in a hostage situation \u2013\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u201cGo figure,\u201d Green Lantern interrupts, Bruce\u2019s kidnappings are a running gag at this point.\u00a0\n\n\nSuperman ignores the interruption, \u201cHe was visiting an elementary school,\u201d he now has everyone\u2019s full attention, \u201cThe thug was waving his gun around, really on edge. I was timing my entrance to take him down without startling him so he wouldn\u2019t start firing randomly into a room full of children. But, Bruce; he was totally calm. He talked the guy down. I\u2019ll never forget it, he just got the man\u2019s attention in a real gentle voice and said,\u201d Clark does a shockingly accurate copy of Bruce Wayne\u2019s voice as he reiterates the words he\u2019d heard, \u201c\u2018These are kids, listen to me, these are just kids. If you need to point the gun at someone, point it at me.\u2019 He got the guy to hand over the gun and turn himself into the police.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThe room is eerily quiet for a few beats before Flash breaks it, \u201cSo, that was when you fell in love?\u201d The room eruptes into chaos and a few laserbeams.\u00a0\n\n\nLater that day, after the responsible parties clean the mess hall from their miniature battle, Superman sought out Batman.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWhy are you always insulting when Bruce Wayne is mentioned? I mean, like, do you just have some sort of grudge against him or do you know something I don\u2019t?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWhy do you care? Don\u2019t tell me Flash was right.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nSuperman\u2019s face flushes, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not \u2013\u201d He takes a steadying breath, \u201cI do really like and admire him. But, I trust your judgement, so if you think Wayne is bad news, I\u2019ll believe you.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nBruce carefully measures his words, \u201cMaybe you just see something in him I can\u2019t,\u201d he pauses, \u201cI trust your judgement, too.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nBruce is gifted with a dazzling Superman smile, so he figures he navigated that confrontation well.\u00a0\n\n\nThe next time Bruce found an appropriate opportunity to use his alter-ego for his amusement was when Batman uncovered a new insidious plot floating around Gotham\u2019s underbelly: a plot to kidnap Bruce Wayne on the orders of Lex Luther. If it was nearly anyone else organizing this kidnapping, Batman would have simply dropped in and shut down the whole operation \u2013 but Lex Luther wanting him, that was different.\u00a0\n\n\nWhen Batman decides to inform Superman as well as the rest of the JLA, he comes prepared with a plan.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cLet me get this straight, you want to let Wayne get kidnapped \u2013 \n\nagain\n\n \u2013 despite us knowing it\u2019s coming this time.\u201d If it were possible Green Lantern\u2019s jaw would be on the floor.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cNo, I want you to protect Wayne and supervise the potential abduction. If he is taken, you follow and learn what Luthor wants.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nSuperman looks stricken, \u201cYou want to use him as bait?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\nDidn\u2019t he just say that?\n\n Exasperated, Batman huffs, \u201cAre you saying four members of the Justice League can\u2019t protect \n\none \n\nperson?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nWonder Woman steps in, sensing the fight that was about to begin, \u201cI agree with Batman\u2019s plan. We should allow Luther\u2019s plans to go forward, under our safeguard, and learn what he wants with Mr. Wayne.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m down too,\u201d Flash adds, \u201cBut, the only thing I don\u2019t get is why you won\u2019t be there, Bats? Like, out of all of the JLA, you're the stealthy, reconnaissance guy.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI have a prior engagement.\u201d Batman departs immediately to deter any followup questions.\u00a0\n\n\nHe doesn\u2019t get away quick enough and still hears Hal say, \u201cFifty bucks he just doesn\u2019t want to get stuck babysitting Princess Brucie.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThe following week, Bruce returns to his office after sitting through a meeting to be greeted by none other than the Justice League. Inwardly he sighs, they did nothing to prep Bruce ahead of time, they just broke into his office on the day of. Outwardly, Bruce startles dramatically, flailing and purposely knocking over a lamp.\u00a0\n\n\nSuperman rushes to his side and attempts to right Bruce. Bruce stumbles over his own feet, carefully falling into Superman\u2019s chest \u2013 knowing from experience throwing his full weight onto him would be akin to walking into a brick wall.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cOh my!\u201d He exclaims in his Brucie-voice, \u201cThe Justice League! What are you doing in my office?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nSuperman has a light blush dusting over his cheeks, he carefully avoids Bruce\u2019s eyes and uses his most commanding, I\u2019m-in-control voice, \u201cWe are terribly sorry to intrude, Mr. Wayne. We\u2019ve uncovered a plot that puts you in direct danger. We\u2019re here to protect you.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nBruce allows himself to fawn, \u201cOh wow, Superman, that sounds so scary! It\u2019s a good thing Timmy isn\u2019t here today, I\u2019d hate to think of my son getting wrapped up in this.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nBruce can\u2019t help but press at the fact that their poor planning could have put an innocent young man in jeopardy \u2013 at least, if Tim was an innocent young man and not, in fact, an active vilagente. Superman grimaced slightly as he seems to remember that Bruce\u2019s son is usually present at Wayne Enterprises, as he runs a good portion of the company these days.\u00a0\n\n\nSuperman clears his throat and finally guides Bruce off his position of leaning against his chest to stand on his own. \u201cYes, that is\u2026 lucky,\u201d Superman says, looking at Diana. Who, in return, only shrugs.\u00a0\n\n\nBruce contains his eye-roll as he makes his way to sit on the loveseat under the largest window of the room. \u201cSo who exactly do I have to thank for saving my life this time?\u201d He puts on his best dumb-socialite smile.\u00a0\n\n\nFlash shuffles his feet before answering, \u201cBatman was the one who \u2013\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nBruce gives a long sigh, successfully cutting off Barry, \u201cOh, not that over dramatic furry!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nFlash instantly chokes and dissolves into a coughing fit. Green Lantern barks out a laugh he couldn\u2019t stifle. Wonder Woman manages to stay composed, but Bruce can see the mirth in her eyes. Superman is frozen in place, an expression of horror painted on his face.\u00a0\n\n\nBruce laughs loudly, \u201cCome on! I\u2019m not wrong! I mean, how can he dress up as a damn bat and stay so serious \n\nall the time!\n\n\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nWonder Woman, naturally, is the first to find her voice, \u201cI am sure Batman would not agree with you.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nBruce waves his hand dismissively, \u201cYeah, yeah. The big ol\u2019 bad bat would have my head, but, come on! It\u2019s \n\nfunny\n\n! You all work with a guy that dresses up as a flying rodent, \n\non purpose\n\n!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nFlash giggles out a laugh, his face turning a concerning shade of red.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou know what, Mr. Wayne?\u201d Green Lantern leans towards Bruce, obviously attempting a flirtatious tone, \u201cI think you have a point.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cOf course I do,\u201d Bruce allows his gaze to trace over Hal\u2019s body and affixes his up-for-anything leer, \u201cAnd please, call me Bruce.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cBruce,\u201d Green Lantern echoes, light pink just visible peeking out under his mask. Bruce chuckles lightly, Hal is sorely mistaken if he thinks he can out seduce the infamous Brucie Wayne.\u00a0\n\n\nSuperman finally breaks out of his daze, \u201cMr. Wayne, I think it will be best if we stick to the matter at hand.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWhatever you say, Superman,\u201d Bruce turns the full force of seductive Brucie Wayne towards him, \u201cI\u2019ll listen to \n\nanything\n\n you tell me to do. And, really, if Green Lantern is calling me Bruce, I have to \n\ninsist\n\n you do too.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nHis charms have significantly less effect than he was expecting, a pretty blush decorates Clark\u2019s face, but he doesn\u2019t become the stuttering mess Bruce has managed to turn him into in his reporter persona. Green Lantern looks suitably put out that his flirting was sidelined.\u00a0\n\n\nSuperman goes over the plan for monitoring Bruce\u2019s upcominging kidnapping and assures him of his safety throughout. Bruce pays enough attention to understand, while still giving a convincing Brucie Wayne performance of being too ditzy to really care about the finer details of anything. Really his mind is occupied with puzzling through Superman\u2019s contained reaction to his come-on.\u00a0\n\n\nClark had made it obscenely obvious that he was not immune to the charms of Brucie Wayne, and moreover he had been significantly wooed by the more real, generous side of Bruce as seen through the WE outreach projects. Bruce has gotten Clark blushing and shy, stuttering and awkward, and even, on one occasion, breathless and near desperate. But today, Superman stayed perfectly calm and collected. And Bruce wants to be annoyed by it, he really does, but he only feels that ever present magnetic pull to the Man of Steel become stronger.\u00a0\n\n\nIf Clark can contain himself, then why has he ever revealed his reactions to Bruce? If Superman \u201creally likes and admires\u201d Brucie Wayne, why wouldn\u2019t he take this chance to show his interest?\u00a0\n\n\nThe mission goes as well as is to be expected. Rather inexperienced goons corner Bruce as he leaves the building, Bruce has to hold his hands several inches apart to keep the zip tie from falling off his wrists.\u00a0\n\n\nHe asks what the goons want from him, as instructed through the earpiece provided by the JLA. They ask for five million dollars and Bruce has to refrain from rolling his eyes \u2013 he\u2019s a well known \n\nbillionaire\n\n, demanding a couple million dollars is just embarrassing \u2013 but they also want passwords for and information on Project Green Mile. Bruce, of course, has \n\nno idea\n\n what they are talking about, just because his name\u2019s on the building doesn\u2019t mean he knows what the company does.\u00a0\n\n\nUpon prodding from Bruce, the goons reveal they don\u2019t know that they\u2019re working for Luther \u2013 he\u2019s inclined to believe it, they didn\u2019t even blindfold him on the car ride to the generic\u00a0\nwarehouse, if Luther was more hands on with these guys they wouldn\u2019t be making a million rookie mistakes.\u00a0\n\n\nThe JLA takes down the goons with little effort, none of them even manage to get a shot off. Wonder Woman goes to Bruce to help him out of his bindings, only for Bruce to place the still intact zip tie in her hands.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThey barely even tightened it,\u201d Bruce huffs, \u201cThey left my eyes uncovered on the drive over. They didn\u2019t even bind my legs and one of the guys with a gun left the safety on!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nEach member of the League gave him a skeptical look.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWhat? You think I don\u2019t know how a kidnapping \n\nshould\n\n go?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThat got Green Lantern snickering into his hand.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI trust you have a way home, Bruce?\u201d Superman asks.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWait, wait,\u201d Bruce walks closer to his colleague, \u201cThe Green Mile Project, it\u2019s a green energy design. We\u2019re currently focusing on creating a car engine, but in the long-run, the goal is to implement them into homes \u2013 it will have the ability to power entire buildings: lighting, heating and cooling systems, state-of-the-art kitchens, entertainment centers, you name it \u2014 it has the capacity to power it. It\u2019s\u2026 a battery, essentially; a really strong, Earth safe battery.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t know what goes on in your company?\u201d Green Lantern sounds genuinely shocked.\u00a0\n\n\nBruce actually rolled his eyes this time, \u201cSeriously? You literally found me today \n\nworking at my company\n\n. If I actually didn\u2019t care about it, why in the hell would I be at its offices?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nSuperman leans over to Green Lantern, \u201cTold you,\u201d he whispers low enough Bruce couldn\u2019t hear \u2013 but he can read lips.\u00a0\n\n\nAt that moment, Bruce\u2019s phone rings.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHey, Alfred,\u201d Bruce answers in code, \u201cYou know, I think we should clean up the basement.\u201d \u2013 \n\nI\u2019m currently surrounded by my Justice League colleagues, at least one of which has super-hearing, as Bruce Wayne, so don\u2019t talk about Batman.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll look into it, Master Bruce,\u201d Alfred replies in code for \u2018\n\nI don\u2019t need Batman, but I need to relay information\n\n,\u2019 \u201cI\u2019m afraid Master Richard is in need of my assistance this evening. You will need to find another way home.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nBruce carefully moderates his voice to not hint at the worry eating away in his gut, \u201cWill you have dinner ready?\u201d \u2013 \n\nIs Dick hurt?\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAlfred\u2019s tone is even, \u201cI\u2019ll find the time.\u201d \u2013 \n\nDick is injured, but it\u2019s not serious.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBruce hangs up his phone and makes a show of pouting down at it.\u00a0\n\n\nSuperman clears his throat, \u201cDo you need assistance getting home?\u201d \n\n\n\n\nBruce gasps dramatically, \u201cYou were eavesdropping!\u201d he accuses. A guilty expression flits across Superman\u2019s face, as he struggles to remain a stoic superhero.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I forgive you\u2026 \n\nif \n\nthat was you offering to take me home.\u201d Bruce replies in a suggestive tone.\u00a0\n\n\nThe same light blush from earlier adorns Clark\u2019s face, \u201cYes, if you would like, I can fly you to Wayne Manor.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cOr I could give you a lift!\u201d Green Lantern interjects.\u00a0\n\n\nBruce doesn\u2019t even spare Hal a glance, \u201cWho in their right mind would say no to Superman?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nSuperman opens his arms in a gesture of picking Bruce up, but instead of just grabbing him asks, \u201cWith your permission.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHow chivalrous!\u201d Bruce loops his arms around Clark\u2019s neck, \u201cOf course.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nSuperman lifts off from the ground leaving Flash looking rather dumbfounded, Green Lantern dejected, and Wonder Woman ready to go home.\u00a0\n\n\nBruce doesn\u2019t hate flying, as many members of the JLA have assumed due to his upset mumbling anytime someone scoops him off his feet. He\u2019s just not overly fond of the loss of control accompanied with being forced to fly at someone else\u2019s mercy. But the act of flying itself, of course he enjoys \n\nthat\n\n \u2013 he willingly jumps off buildings and swings off ledges with a grapnel gun every night in Gotham. So, Bruce lets go of his Batman sensibility for just a moment, just one flight, and enjoys the feeling of being safely tucked into the chest of his most trusted confidant and revels in the feeling of soaring through the night sky.\u00a0\n\n\nThe pair arrive at the manor far sooner than Bruce would have preferred, Superman gently placing Bruce back on the ground.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThank you for your assistance today, Bruce,\u201d Superman says, his hands still resting on Bruce\u2019s shoulders.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cIt was the least I could do,\u201d Bruce smiles, wide and very Brucie, but genuinely, \u201cI make a very good hostage.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nSuperman chuckles and starts to float just slightly, \u201cHave a good evening\u2013\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWait!\u201d Bruce grabs Superman\u2019s hand tugs forcefully to get him back to eye level, \u201cThank you,\u201d Bruce\u2019s voice drops close to a whisper, \u201cfor keeping me safe.\u201d \n\nAlways.\n\n Bruce leans in and kisses his cheek. Lightly, just a press of affection, of desire, of gratitude. Half a second of honesty.\u00a0\n\n\nHe pulls back and meets his friend\u2019s eyes. He doesn\u2019t know what Clark is seeing in his expression, but Bruce knows his face is too open, too honest, too real. Bruce allows his dopy lopsided grin to take over, pushes his emotions away.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cBe seeing you,\u201d Bruce turns and stalks towards the manor before Superman can say anything.\u00a0\n\n\nBatman organizes a meeting to be apprised of the abduction\u2019s outcome the following day, as he should have not have any knowledge of the specifics \u2013 not that anyone would question him if he did. Bruce uses the meeting to analyze his team\u2019s debriefing abilities.\u00a0\n\n\nAfter the meat of the meeting is covered it devolves into aimless chatter which naturally moves to the topic of Bruce Wayne. Green Arrow had caught wind that Lantern tried to get into Bruce\u2019s pants \u2013 unsuccessfully \u2013 and will not let him live it down.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cSo from the valuable information I\u2019ve gathered,\u201d Oliver ribs Hal, \u201cNot only did Brucie ignore your advances, he was all over Supes!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou should have seen it, man,\u201d Flash joins, \u201cEvery word out of his mouth of innuendo!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cSounds like Bruce,\u201d Green Arrow mutters.\u00a0\n\n\nGreen Lantern turned to Superman, his annoyance evident, \u201cWhy\u2019d you have to step on my game, dude?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t \u2013 I wasn\u2019t \u2013\u201d Superman spudders, trying to find the words to explain himself.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou took him home!\u201d Hal exclaims, \u201cDid something happen? What happened?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nAs Superman steadily turns red, Bruce speaks up, \u201cI see we will be getting no more work done. This meeting is concluded.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nBatman makes his exit, ready to leave Superman to stutter through an explanation of offering Bruce Wayne a flight home. But, instead, a few feet down the hallway Superman catches up to him, calling for his attention.\u00a0\n\n\nBatman turns to his friend as he says, \u201cThe thing with Bruce\u2026 It really wasn\u2019t like how it sounded in there, B!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nBruce can\u2019t stop himself from teasing slightly, \u201cAnd what did it sound like?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nSuperman reddens slightly, but his voice remains steady, \u201cEveryone gets starry eyed over Superman. I get it all the time. But, I would \n\nnever\n\n entertain the idea of using Superman to\u2026 seduce someone.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nBruce allows the smallest, slightest smile to show, \u201cI know.\u201d He turns to leave, thinking the conversation finished.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Superman continues, \u201cI know you know that I \n\nlike\n\n Bruce Wayne. That I want him to like me, not Superman, but \n\nme\n\n. But, you also have to know\u2026 If I had to choose between my two favorite Gothamites, I would always pick you.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nSeveral things become suddenly clear to Bruce. Superman didn\u2019t try to woo Bruce because he wants to charm him as Clark Kent. But also, Clark only \n\nlikes\n\n Bruce Wayne. Where with Batman, he\u2026 \n\nhuh.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re Superman, Clark,\u201d Bruce picks his wording very carefully, \u201cYou have many talents that ensure you\u2026 You won\u2019t have to choose.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nBatman turns and leaves Superman sputtering behind him.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cClark? Wait, Bats! How did \u2013 When did you \u2013\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nBruce lets a real smile break out on his face.\u00a0\n\n\nBatman enters the Watchtower mess hall and is greeted by a loud conversation concerning the maintenance of the space station. Many Justice League members are throwing around numbers, different costs for things, others are estimating man hours of labor.\u00a0\n\n\nBatman cuts into the conversation, genuinely curious, \u201cDo you not know who funds all of this?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nHe\u2019s met with an array of blank expressions.\u00a0\n\n\nHe lets out an annoyed huff, he hadn\u2019t even tried very hard to conceal it. \u201cBruce Wayne.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThe room erupted, immediately giving Bruce a headache. He moves to make himself the coffee he ventured away from his work to have. Soon the room quiets to the normal level of noise.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cSo, Spooky,\u201d Green Lantern gets his attention, \u201cSince the guy paid for all this, could we get Brucie up here? Give him a tour or something?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nWith his back still to the group, Batman smirks into his coffee. That could be fun.\u00a0\n\n\nBatman addresses his teammates, \u201cI\u2019ll speak to him.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nFlash gapes, \u201cWait, do you actually know him?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou could say that,\u201d Bruce doesn\u2019t technically lie.\u00a0\n\n\nBruce allows himself to get dragged around the Watchtower by various members of the JLA.\u00a0\n\n\nAquaman ushers him to the large aquarium affixed to his quarters to show off his marine telepathy. Bruce points out the pair of dolphins happily playing and asks if they are \u201clike, endangered or something? I think WE is doing something with endangered species.\u201d Which then sets Arthur off on a tangent about marine life dying, to which Bruce tells him about Wayne Enterprises efforts to be 100% eco-friendly and their various ocean cleaning projects. By the time Bruce is dragged off by Flash, Aquaman is looking at him starry-eyed.\u00a0\n\n\nFlash, in turn, brings him to the mess hall. He loads him up a plate of all his favorite dishes that Bruce \u201cjust has to try.\u201d Bruce, seeing the nearly one-foot tall pile of the greasiest food he\u2019s ever encountered, inquires: \u201cI read somewhere that super speed makes you, like, super hungry all the time. What\u2019s, like, the fastest you can eat?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nBarry has Bruce time him as he devores the heaping plate, much to Bruce\u2019s relief. Once he finished Bruce, praises in the same fashion he used on Jason when he was Robin \u2013 which, as predicted, leaves Flash looking at Bruce like he hung all the stars in the sky.\u00a0\n\n\nGreen Arrow pulls him away next to his archery range. He shows off his perfect aim, only stumbling over his stories occasionally in an effort to not reveal himself as Bruce\u2019s \n\nactual\n\n friend Oliver Queen. Bruce smiles at him and asks if he can teach him how to shoot an arrow.\u00a0\n\n\nBruce gets his stance and grip wrong, allowing Oliver to coach him on the technique Bruce has no business knowing. He purposely misses his first dozen shots, getting whiny about not\u00a0\nbeing able to get it right. After Oliver corrects him a few more times, Bruce shoots a bulls-eye. He jumps up and down cheering as Green Arrow congratulates him.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI only got it because I had such a good teacher,\u201d Bruce preens, causing Oliver to support a slight flush.\u00a0\n\n\nThe day continues on in that fashion. Wonder Woman shows off her impressive sword collection and Bruce asks her to explain the benefits of one type of blade versus another.\u00a0\n\n\nGreen Lantern directs Bruce to the hanger to see the fighter jet he\u2019s converting to a spaceship with the help of Batman and Martian Manhunter. Bruce asks about the effects of extended space flight because he \u201cheard somewhere that being in space for a long time is, like, bad for people or something,\u201d causing Hal to explain the mechanics that makes \n\nhis\n\n ship better than the rest by drawing power from his ring.\u00a0\n\n\nThe next person to pull him aside is J\u2019onn, he brings him to the lab where Batman and himself have been studying a new alien plant species.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI know who you are,\u201d J\u2019onn says, not one to mince words.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Bruce lets his voice drop closer to his Batman tempo, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to spoil this for me, are you?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nJ\u2019onn pauses, his face unreadable as always, \u201cYou find this\u2026 funny,\u201d he eventually says.\u00a0\n\n\nBruce sighs, \u201cIt\u2019s \n\nso\n\n funny.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nJ\u2019onn nods once, \u201cSuperman is coming,\u201d he begins to leave, but pauses at the door, \u201cIt \n\nis\n\n funny.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThe martian departs and Bruce knows his secret is safe.\u00a0\n\n\nA moment later Superman appears in the doorway, \u201cHey, B, uh, I mean, uh, Mr. Wayne \u2013 or uh, Bruce! Bruce.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nBruce quirks an eyebrow as his only response.\u00a0\n\n\nSuperman takes a deep breath, \u201cI was wondering\u2026 if we could talk?\u201d\n\n\nBruce smiles, \u201cSure, let's go somewhere private. Like, by your quarters.\u201d Bruce walks past Clark, leading the way to the hallway housing Batman\u2019s and Superman\u2019s rooms, side by side.\n\n\nOnce they arrive at their destination, standing between the two rooms, Clark speaks again, \u201cI wanted to ask you, just to be sure \u2013 I think I know the answer, but just in case\u2026\u201d he trails off, looking to Bruce hopefully.\u00a0\n\n\nBruce sighs and walks to the door to Batman\u2019s room. He puts his hand on the bio-scanner which lights up green, allowing him entrance. He turns back to his friend, \u201cYou coming in, Clark?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nSuperman smiles and follows behind the vigilante.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou know, you could have just told me,\u201d Clark says once the door shuts behind him, \u201cLike, actually told me, without all the puzzles.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an investigative journalist, I knew you\u2019d figure it out.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nClark rolls his eyes, but then his face grows more serious, \u201cWhy do you always insult yourself?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean,\u201d Bruce responds flatly, sitting on his bed.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYes, you do,\u201d he insists, \u201cI\u2019ve heard Batman call Bruce Wayne all sorts of horrible things. And I\u2019ve interviewed you, you never have a kind word for Batman. You can\u2019t really hate yourself, right?\u201d Clark\u2019s voice nearly breaks.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI never said I did,\u201d Bruce disagrees, \u201cBatman, playboy Bruce Wayne. Yeah, I don\u2019t like them. They\u2019re necessary evils \u2013\u201d \n\n\n\u201cBruce\u2026\u201d Clark cuts him off.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d Bruce continues, \u201cThey\u2019re not me. They\u2019re both performances, neither of them is who I really am.\u201d Bruce meets Clark\u2019s gaze, \u201cI know you can understand, you\u2019re not wholly Superman \u2013 bigger than life, superhero \u2013 and you're not completely Clark Kent \u2013 mild-mannered, bumbling reporter. You\u2019re somewhere in between the two,\u201d Bruce drops the eye contact, \u201cThe best parts of each of them.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nHe looks back to Clark when he feels the bed dip beside him. Clark looks at him with a shy smile and a cute blush, \u201cSo, who are you really, then?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nBruce steels himself, \u201cYou could come over to the manor sometime, have dinner with me. I wouldn\u2019t mind you learning who I am when I'm\u2026 just Bruce.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cJust Bruce,\u201d Clark echoes, with a smile he adds, \u201cKal.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my birth name\u2026 on Krypton. Kal-El,\u201d Clark rubs the back of his neck, \u201cFor when we\u2019re just us\u2026 just Bruce and\u2026\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cKal.\u201d Bruce finishes.\u00a0\n\n\nClark smiles at him, blindingly bright, but Bruce doesn\u2019t dare turn away.\u00a0\n\n\nClark starts to ask, \u201cCan I \u2013\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nBruce cuts him off, \u201cJust kiss me already.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI have not heard of this game,\u201d J\u2019onn is saying.\u00a0\n\n\nBruce pauses outside of the mess hall, listening to the current conversation before making his presence known.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty self explanatory, man,\u201d Green Lantern interjects.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWell, yeah, kinda,\u201d Flash explains, \u201cSomeone will pick three famous people. And you just have to pick which one you would marry, which you would fuck, and which one you would kill. Hypothetically.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m picking first!\u201d Hal announces.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cNo superheroes,\u201d Clark demands, \u201cWe learned the hard way it\u2019s a very bad idea \u2013 and I\u2019m not going through that again.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d Lantern sighs, \u201cDwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson, Robert Downey, Jr., and Bruce Wayne.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nBruce hears a collective \n\nooh\n\n sound off and one hesitant \n\nuhh\n\n from Clark.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI would kill Robert, unfortunately; fuck The Rock, to show him I can rock his world,\u201d the room boo\u2019s Hal\u2019s terrible pun, \u201cAnd marry Brucie for that sweet dough and sweeter sex.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nBruce should have expected that, to be honest.\u00a0\n\n\nDiana speaks next, \u201cKill Downey, fuck Wayne, marry Johnson.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nBruce thanks each of Diana\u2019s gods she went into zero detail.\n\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d Oliver gives his ranking, \u201cI\u2019m definitely marrying Bruce, then I guess, fuck The Rock and kill RDJ.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nArthur announces his picks to the room in booming voice, \u201cI doubt Robert has the stamina I look for in a partner, so I would kill him. The Rock would be good for one night, I\u2019m sure. And I would marry Bruce Wayne and we would use his vast fortune to save ocean life everywhere. Besides, I have heard of his many sexual exploits and we would be sure to please eachother for many years to come.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nBruce runs through several breathing exercises to keep his face from flushing bright red.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your line up, J\u2019onn?\u201d Flash prompts him.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cKill Dwayne Johnson, fuck Bruce Wayne, marry Robert Downey, Jr.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cNow, you Supes,\u201d Hal asks.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cUm, kill Dwayne, fuck Robet, marry Bruce,\u201d Clark says very fast.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cOf course you want to marry Brucie\u2026\u201d Hal says with obvious jealousy, \u201cOkay, Flash that just leaves you.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nBruce really wishes he had just walked away when he realized what the game was. Please, no one chose to kill him, please have Barry be the exception.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Barry starts, \u201cFirst of all, eat the rich and all that.\u201d \n\n\nClark mumbles, \u201cOh, I intend to.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThe room is filled with shocked gasps and one \n\n\u2018Suuupes\u2019\n\n.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cDid I say that out loud?\u201d Clark adds in a horrified whisper. Bruce can \n\nhear \n\nthe blush coloring Clark\u2019s cheeks.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d Barry continues, \u201cI would kill The Rock, god rest his mighty soul. Fuck RDJ. And marry Brucie just to be his sugar baby.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nCould have been worse, Bruce decides.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cBatman, what is your pick?\u201d J\u2019onn says dilerbertally loudly, despite knowing Bruce heard everything that was said.\n\n\nBruce can hear J\u2019onn\u2019s delight being projected into his mind as he turns the corner and enters the mess hall. Bruce thinks back, \n\nDamn you.\n\n But he can\u2019t help but share in the humor of the situation.\u00a0\n\n\nWell, if this will be the last time he can use this joke, Bruce is going to go out swinging.\u00a0\n\n\nWith everyone\u2019s eyes on him, Bruce makes a show of out thinking it through before declaring, \u201cMarry Robert Downey, Jr., fuck Dwayne Johnson, and kill myself.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nClark, who has been diligently avoiding looking at Bruce, suddenly stares at him, wide eyed.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cUm, that\u2019s not how the game works,\u201d Barry tries to correct him, \u201cYou have to choose for Bruce.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nBruce says, \u201cOh, I did,\u201d as he reaches up and pulls off his cowl and then sits back to enjoy the show.\u00a0\n\n\nOliver frankly looks like he is short circuiting, no doubt trying and failing to align his mental image of his terribly stupid friend to match that of his cunning teammate. Barry looks like he could start crying and Hal looks to be about two seconds away from flying into space and never coming back. Arthur, to his credit, looks slightly embarrassed, but is suppressing it well.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI told you there was more to Bruce than you\u2019d think,\u201d Clark supplies.\u00a0\n\n\nOnce Diana comes back to herself, a smile graces her features and she says, \u201cI\u2019m glad you have chosen to share this with us.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nBruce smirks, \u201cDon\u2019t be too glad. As I do have to inform you, your dreams of swindling me for my money through marriage won\u2019t come to fruition. I\u2019m taken.\u201d Bruce gives a level look at his boyfriend.\u00a0\n\n\nFlash\u2019s jaw drops open, \u201cYou and Supes?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cFuck!\u201d Green Lantern exclaims.\u00a0\n\n\nOne by one everyone gives their congratulations and blessing to the couple, then Diana and J\u2019onn usher their friends out of the room, leaving only Bruce and Clark at the table.\u00a0\n\n\nA mischievous smirk works its way onto Bruce\u2019s face, \u201cSo, you want to marry me, Kal?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cBruce\u2026\u201d Clark wines.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d Bruce pretends to relent, \u201cbut tell me you\u2019ll make good on your promise to eat the rich.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\"Bruce!\"\n"
