    "text": "In all the years he's known Bakugou Katsuki, Midoriya Izuku, somehow naively, thought that nothing can surprise him anymore when it comes to his childhood-friend-turned-bully-turned-significant-other. At this point in their lives, the time they've spent without each other even in the periphery is absurdly miniscule compared to the ones that do, to the point that Izuku honestly can't think of a life without Kacchan ever being by his side.\nWhile not all-encompassing, the explosive blond has been the center of a lot of his firsts\u2014 his first friendship, his first surge of genuine admiration, his first hurt, his first real heartbreak. In the end, Bakugou Katsuki had been his first love, in all the ways that counted and mattered, and despite the common belief that this kind of love never lasts, Izuku had been determined to beat the staggering odds, too stubborn and hardheaded to do anything else.\nJust as he never gave up on his dream to become a hero.\nIt's a long, winding, thorny road to his destination. And with everything that has happened to him, Izuku could confidently say that it was wholly worth it, accepting One-for-All from his hero, All Might, pursuing the same path as his idol, making new friends and reconnecting with old ones. He has gained more blessings than he has ever dreamed of in his life, alongside a heavy duty that he now must bear and see through for the sake of the world.\nBut not alone. Not anymore, not when he had his family, his friends, his mentors and allies.\nNot when he has Kacchan.\nThe shift in their relationship is volatile, fast-paced, total, and overwhelming. Izuku would have been content just to be Kacchan\u2019s friend again, to just have the blond look at him and acknowledge that he\u2019s worth something. Not approval, exactly, but merely an acceptance of Izuku\u2019s existence, of his abilities to stand on his two feet and remain at the other\u2019s side as a comrade, as an equal. Izuku has never cared for glory or titles; he only wanted to save people, and is more than willing to let his once-boyhood friend lead them on that path, because Kacchan, at his very core, also wants to be a hero, more than anyone else Izuku knows.\nInstead, what he gets is much, much more.\nDating is the period wherein a person gets to know someone else, in a better, more intimate setting. Izuku thought things wouldn\u2019t really change once they started their own relationship, meeting the blond as a snot-nosed kid who didn\u2019t know any better. But being the object of Katsuki\u2019s affection is radically\u2026 different from being anything else in his life. The other gives himself wholly to anything he deems worthy of his time and effort, and once Izuku manages to shift into that category in the other teen\u2019s mind, his interactions with his\u2026 boyfriend (and gosh Izuku would forever flail internally and squeal silently whenever he thought of Kacchan as\u2026 that) are still the same, but wildly new, at the same time.\nKacchan still butts heads with him. Still yells and sneers and curses when angered or provoked, but Kacchan also kisses and touches and holds him with such temperance and care. Now, he looks and acts as if Izuku is something to be cherished, and it still amazes Izuku all the time, to know that he can draw out Kacchan\u2019s gentler, softer side that he keeps carefully hidden away and somehow manages to express so roughly.\nThis, in itself, doesn\u2019t shock Izuku at all. His beloved might be rough and sharp at his edges, but ultimately, Kacchan is a good person. His bark is much worse than his bite, and slowly but surely everyone else is realizing that too. So when people exclaim in amazement that his boyfriend\u2019s actually been so helpful to them, that he isn\u2019t as bad as they think, Izuku merely smiles and beams in pride. He has always known that from the very beginning, even if it did, admittedly, take a while to get Kacchan to that point visibly.\nBut the things he is discovering about his boyfriend now\u2026 are so completely out of left field that even he has a hard time processing it completely.\nLike most life-altering events, it happens on a typical, unremarkable day. It\u2019s early evening, just after the end of the day\u2019s classes, and Izuku and the rest of his classmates are back in or around the dorms, spending their free time the best way they know how. Since they all live together now, arrangements have to be made when it comes to activities and household chores in an attempt to learn independence and shared responsibility. Everyone is on a rotation doing all of the chores at least once a week, and admittedly, some days are better than others when it comes to meal times. But everyone has learned to look forward to the start of the weekend dinners since that\u2019s the time when Kacchan and Satou are in charge of the dishes, and today is no different.\nWhile his boyfriend is slaving away making them delicious, yummy food, Izuku is in the common room with his friends, opting to finish his homework sooner rather than later. He\u2019s joined by a few people, and they are all appropriately quiet as they work on their respective subjects, speaking up once in a while to ask for help on something specific. Izuku likes these impromptu studying sessions when they happen, always willing to help and be helped in turn, and it\u2019s always a nice feeling to bond with friends on a shared activity.\nAt the same time, Kacchan\u2019s loud, distinguishable noises can be heard somewhere in the vicinity of the kitchen, already hard at work, and Izuku hides a smile as he jots down an answer in his notebook.\nEverything is normal. Quiet. Peaceful.\n\nUntil it wasn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cBABE!\u201d\nIzuku\u2019s head jerks up, blinking, wondering if he\u2019s heard correctly. A few people also raise their heads, jolted from their concentration, and everyone shares a moment of confusion as to what just transpired, until\u2014\n\u201cBabe, come here a sec!\u201d\nIzuku\u2019s jaw drops, pencil rolling away from his now equally slack fingers as his nearby friends whip their heads to stare at him, unnervingly in unison. The silence that enveloped the common room is pronounced, abrupt, with not one person moving a single inch.\nNo one dared to breathe, even as they all exchanged looks. Because they must be having a collective auditory hallucination, surely? They must have heard Satou calling out, of course, how obvious, despite their buff classmate recently expressing his single status after his brief but whirlwind affair with a General Course student. That has to be it, right?\nBecause the alternative, the other option, the actual truth, is absolutely, completely impossib\u2014\n\u201cBabe! The fuck\u2019s takin\u2019 you so long?!\u201d\nAshido manages to let out an aborted shriek before being tackled to the ground. Todoroki manages to speak afterwards, his wide, mismatched eyes and hoarse voice as he faces Izuku\u2019s direction the only indication of his extreme shock.\n\u201cMidoriya\u2026 I think Bakugou\u2019s asking for you.\u201d\n\u201cM-Me?!\u201d Izuku manages to answer, voice equally high and strangled, still not quite able to believe what he has just heard. His face is starting to burn from the combination of scrutiny and mortification. \u201cAre y-you sure?! B-But Kacchan doesn\u2019t really\u2014!\u201d\n\u201cDEKU!\u201d His boyfriend yelled again, tone shifting from general annoyance to seriously pissed off this time. \u201cGet your ass in the kitchen now!\u201d\n\u201cOh my gosh\u2026\u201d A floating tank top and shorts across from him starts to giggle maniacally, gloved hands rapidly gesturing, \u201cdid you just hear that?! Bakugou just called Midorin \u2018bab\u2014\u2019!\u201d\n\u201cI-I\u2019ll go and see what he needs!\u201d Izuku yelps, cutting Hagakure off as he scrambles to his feet, almost tripping on the table leg in the process. \u201cKacchan, I\u2019m coming!\u201d\n\u201cNot if you don\u2019t get here within two seconds!\u201d His boyfriend hollers back, and with that, the stillness and tension that has been steadily growing inside the room finally shatters.\nThe ensuing uproar feels like a physical punch to the gut, and Izuku escapes as fast as his legs can carry him, calves flickering briefly with the contained power of One-for-All as he leaves the chaos behind. Izuku has never felt more relieved to see the sight of the stove happily bubbling away with cooking food.\nInside, his boyfriend is alone, ladle in hand as he hovers over a pot, and Izuku makes a beeline for him immediately.\n\u201cKacchan!\u201d\nThe blond turns to face him, expression grumpy, but doesn\u2019t look to be in a terrible mood. \u201cTook you long enough. Here, taste.\u201d He presses a small saucer to Izuku\u2019s lips without preamble, already filled with a bit of soup. \u201cNew recipe. My tastebud\u2019s fucked from all the chili for lunch earlier.\u201d\nFingertips brush against the back of his boyfriend\u2019s hand as Izuku automatically takes an obedient sip, the savory, tangy, salty taste of miso coating his tongue. He feels Kacchan studying his face closely for any change in expression, but as always, his boyfriend\u2019s culinary skills shine through even on the first attempt.\n\u201cMm! It\u2019s really good, Kacchan!\u201d Izuku beams at him, finishing up everything in the saucer. \u201cIt tastes like how my Mom usually makes it!\u201d\n\u201cThat so?\u201d Kacchan returns back to the stove, but not in time, Izuku notices, to get rid of the small, upward, pleased quirk of his lips. \u201cThought I fucked up the ratio a little, Auntie Inko uses a lot more dashi in her broth\u2014\u201d\nSomething grabbed into Izuku\u2019s chest, wrapped around his heart, and squeezed. \u201cKacchan,\u201d he starts, voice wobbly, because really? His boyfriend would go so far? \u201cDid you ask my mom for the recipe?\u201d\n\u201cStuff it,\u201d the blond growled, the back of his neck turning scarlet. But he doesn\u2019t move when Izuku throws himself at the other\u2019s back, arms wrapping themselves around that lithe waist and holding tight. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask, nerd. She gave it to me. So might as well try it out since we have the shit for it and everything.\u201d\n\u201cKacchan, you\u2019re the best.\u201d Izuku sighs happily, placing a tiny smooch in the middle of his boyfriend\u2019s back, just where the edge of his tank top meets bare skin. \u201cThank you. I miss Mom\u2019s cooking a lot.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah, fuck off, this ain\u2019t for you, shitty Deku.\u201d The blond muttered, the glaring lie just making Izuku cling on that much more. But the ensuing comfortable silence just makes the ruckus still going on in the neighboring space that much more apparent.\nAnd soon enough, Izuku feels the other turn towards the commotion.\n\u201cThe hell\u2019s happening outside? What\u2019re the extras doing now?\u201d\nAnd it just reminds Izuku of the things his boyfriend has to answer for.\n\u201cYou happened, Kacchan!\u201d Izuku whisper-screams, quickly untangling himself and slugging his boyfriend in between his shoulder blades. He deserves much, much worse, but Izuku just can\u2019t make himself punch enough to hurt. He would never hurt Kacchan deliberately. \u201cDid you really have to say that in front of our friends?! Really?!\u201d\n\u201c\u2018s not like the side characters don\u2019t know we\u2019re together,\u201d Kacchan rolls his eyes, lowering the heat on the stove before facing him again, leaning against the counter, bare arms crossed on his chest. Izuku tries not to stare, bright pink brushing across his cheeks. \u201cFucking idiots makin\u2019 a big deal outta everything. Like I don\u2019t see a coupla them makin\u2019 out on the staircase every other fuckin\u2019 day\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s still your fault, though!\u201d Izuki flails, starting to feel faint from the barrage of memories that decided to assault his mind. The heat of the kitchen isn\u2019t doing any favors for his rising body temperature. \u201cDid you really have to call me b-b-b-b-ba-bab\u2014\u201d God, just trying to say it out loud is enough to make Izuku fall into an aneurysm.\n\u201cWhat, you gotta problem with that?\u201d His boyfriend deliberately straightens out and ducks his head down to bring his face down at Izuku\u2019s eye-level. \u201cYou tellin\u2019 me what I can and can\u2019t do, dollface?\u201d\n\u201cD-Dollface?\u201d Izuku squeaks, face suffused with a dark blush and thoroughly distracted as his boyfriend\u2019s handsome features completely fills his line of sight. First it was b-b-bab\u2014 whatever, and then another one! Izuku is seriously going to pass out. \u201cW-What\u2019s gotten into you? Are you serious right now? Are you making fun of me?\u201d\n\u201cHaah?\u201d An incredulous look on his boyfriend\u2019s face. \u201cWhy the hell would I wanna make fun of you? Deku, if I wanted to, trust me, I\u2019da done it way worse than this.\u201d\nAnd from previous experience, Izuku knows that to be a stone-cold fact.\n\u201cAnd \u2018sides\u2026\u201d Kacchan continues, shrugging, \u201cthere\u2019s no real reason. Just felt like it. \u2018Cause you\u2019re mine, and I can.\u201d\nAs if his casual words weren\u2019t making Izuku\u2019s heart do crazy trapezes inside his ribcage.\nIzuku wheezes. Or gurgles. Or maybe a combination of both. \u201cKacchan\u2014\u201d\nWine-colored eyes alight on his figure, taking in his red-hot face with the amused look of a predator playing with its food before it goes in for the kill.\n\u201cYour reactions too.\u201d A hand comes up to pinch at his cheek, exactly over where his freckles are. \u201c\u2018s cute as fuck.\u201d\n\u201cMean! So you are making fun of me!\u201d Izuku cries, trying to breathe, to calm his heart down, and failing both miserably.\nIn response, his boyfriend merely draws closer, near enough for Izuku to inhale the familiar, intoxicating smell of smoke and nitroglycerin, close enough that Izuku\u2019s eyes slip shut of their own accord, body tensing, anticipating. The hand on his cheek travels, a lone finger slowly tracing the curve of his neck from the tip of his ear to the top of his collarbone in a way that makes Izuku break out in a full-body flush.\nKacchan\u2019s voice murmurs into his ear, hot and low and gravely, soft spikes of hair teasing the sides of his face.\nIzuku shivers, goosebumps rising on his skin.\nThen the finger on his chest gives him a solid push back, and just like that, the moment is broken.\n\u201cCome on, get outta here.\u201d His boyfriend starts to shoo him out of the kitchen. \u201cAnd the shitheads fuckin\u2019 eavesdropping,\u201d his boyfriend called over at Izuku\u2019s shoulder, causing a domino effect of tumbling bodies, judging from the sound of it, \u201cshould go an\u2019 make themselves useful by setting the goddamn table, dinner\u2019s almost done.\u201d\n\u201cYou got it, bro!\u201d Kirishima answers cheerfully from the doorway, not even attempting to hide their crime, and Izuku groans out loud, pressing his palms to his cheeks as he\u2019s thrown out of the blond\u2019s territory.\nHis face feels hot. He can\u2019t even think, ears burning and knees weak as he stumbles into the dining room to help out the others with the utensils.\n\u201cMidoriya-san? Are you all right?\u201d Yaoyorozu places a light hand on his shoulder, apparently having just arrived at the common room. \u201cYou look really flushed. Are you sick?\u201d\n(\u201cNot my fault you can\u2019t take a little teasin\u2019, doll.\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d Izuku manages to cough out, categorically refusing to make eye contact with anyone else, especially those who are giving him teasing, knowing looks.\nIf mastering One-for-All doesn\u2019t manage to kill him, then his boyfriend\u2019s antics definitely will.\nIzuku\u2019s boyfriend doesn\u2019t stop at the one.\n\u201cKacchan, do you have a second?\u201d\nIt has been a few days. Everything goes back to normal, and Izuku has mostly convinced himself that what happened is a fever dream that his mind managed to make up. His friends vacillate between letting it go and dying to discuss it openly, if the way Iida mouths the word-that-must-not-be-named every so often in Izuku\u2019s presence. But in the end, they don\u2019t bring it up during conversation (not in front of him at least), and Izuku is grateful.\nOverall, their reaction is simply baffled, and honestly, Izuku doesn\u2019t blame them. The ash blond has always been expressive orally, his opinions constantly heard and available to anyone who cared to listen. Negative sentiments are usually the norm, but then again, is it so hard to believe that Kacchan can also go to the other end of the spectrum and express his feelings about things he likes?\nBut then again, his boyfriend hasn\u2019t done it like this before. Izuku still gets heart palpitations when he has his guard down and the memory surges back into his mind.\n(And if he spent the rest of that night screaming into his pillow, giggling and kicking his legs giddily onto his yellow and blue All Might bedsheets, that\u2019s for him and his limited edition figurines to know and for no one else to find out.)\nLike most of his classmates, he\u2019s working on his assignments for the day. People are always free to work in their own rooms if they want the peace and quiet, but for those who want a little bustle and the shared feeling of struggling together, they have blocked off a set of hours in the common room that\u2019s dedicated to studying and tutoring so people will know when not to do anything that can distract the rest of the class. It\u2019s a system that\u2019s worked well so far, and Izuku takes full advantage of it, going to the table that the blond has commandeered as \u2018his\u2019 during these sessions, alongside the people Izuku affectionately calls in his head as his boyfriend\u2019s squad.\nKacchan, who is in the middle of a lull after a long lecture to the group, glowering at their lowered heads, pauses and looks up at him. The rolled up notebook against his palm unfurls.\n\u201cYeah, I got a bit. S\u2019up, baby?\u201d\nIn front of them, Kaminari starts to choke, and Kirishima starts thumping him on the back, heads whipping in Izuku\u2019s direction so quickly he winces. He\u2019s sure he hears a few necks crack, and Izuku feels like he should be concerned.\nAshido is almost vibrating out of her seat in excitement, and Sero trains his already larger-than-normal eyes on them, agog. Their silence is unnerving, and Izuku can feel the start of a blush creeping up his face. Seriously, when will Kacchan stop teasing him? With a willpower he doesn\u2019t know he actually possessed, he forcefully pushes his feelings aside and ignores the peanut gallery to get to the matter at hand.\n\u201cC-Can you help me? I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve gotten the formula right for this section, but my solution\u2019s coming up different every time.\u201d Izuku\u2019s okay with numbers, but only if they\u2019re used in the practical sense. Theoretical formulas are just confusing to him. \u201cYou\u2019ve always been better at Math.\u201d\n\u201cGive it, it\u2019s prolly you skipping a few steps again,\u201d Kacchan leans forward at the same time Izuku places his notebook on the table, picking up his pencil. \u201cWhich one?\u201d\n\u201cHere,\u201d Izuku points at the section, and watches avidly as his boyfriend works through the problem set, bending over and setting his elbows on the table, unabashedly staring. It\u2019s always a treat to see the blond up close and personal like this, completely focused on his task, and Izuku can\u2019t help the small, dreamy, and most probably silly grin on his face.\n\u201cAww, look, Midori\u2019s so in love with him,\u201d Izuku hears from Ashido, voice not as quiet as she thinks it is. Izuku manages not to splutter, heat blooming hotter on his cheeks at his obvious swooning.\n\u201cI know, so manly,\u201d Kirishima sighs happily, beaming at them like a proud mother, and yeah, Izuku thinks as blood rushes through his face, he should really stop looking at Kacchan like that, shouldn\u2019t he?\n\u201cThought so,\u201d his boyfriend says after a few minutes, glancing at him. He probably isn\u2019t listening to the commentary, which is a relief. \u201cYou forgot to apply the formula on both sides of the equation, idiot.\u201d\n\u201cH-Huh? I did?\u201d Izuku slides closer to his boyfriend\u2019s side to check, absentmindedly placing a hand on Kacchan\u2019s broad back as he squints at his work. \u201cWhere?\u201d\nHis boyfriend tilts his head up at Izuku then, clicking his tongue as a familiar scowl appears on his face.\n\u201cStop hoverin\u2019, motherfucker. Can\u2019t fuckin\u2019 talk to you like this, it\u2019s irritating as shit. Come\u2019ere, bunny.\u201d\n\u201cBunny,\u201d Sero repeats in a way that suggests that he\u2019s actually dying, and Izuku deeply empathizes. But whatever response he has to the new name is dashed away when a warm hand snags itself around his waist and tugs him sideways.\nRight on top of Kacchan\u2019s lap.\n\u201cWaah\u2014cchan!\u201d Izuku flails a little, now perched on one of his boyfriend\u2019s thighs like a toddler. The chair surprisingly does not give, given the additional weights, but Kacchan is strong, taking in Izuku\u2019s entire, bulked up mass without a change in expression. His muscles don\u2019t even spasm under the weight. \u201cWhat are you\u2014?!\u201d\n\u201cListen up and take notes nerd, \u2018cause I ain\u2019t tellin\u2019 you more than once,\u201d Kacchan starts, the hand on his waist securing him in position as he taps at the notebook with the other. Izuku doesn\u2019t think he doesn\u2019t have any blood left in his body as the rest of it goes towards his head and face, fingertips tingling even as he tries to ignore the sudden clamor on the other side of the table. \u201cSo here\u2019s where you screwed up\u2014\u201d\nIzuku tries his best to pay attention, and surprisingly does. Kacchan is a good teacher if someone knows where to meet him halfway, and Izuku now has a better understanding on where he went wrong as his boyfriend patiently explains the correct process to him. The arm around him is grounding, keeping him alert and in the present, and Izuku, despite himself, leans against his boyfriend completely, nodding along as his mistakes are pointed out and corrected.\n(Dimly he registers the sound of a phone camera shutter going off, and Izuku makes a note to ask them for a copy of the photo, after he gets over the wave of utter mortification that settles over him like a weighted blanket.)\n\u201cOh, I get it now!\u201d Izuku says once everything has been made clear to him. \u201cThank you, Kacchan!\u201d He beams at the other male in gratitude. \u201cI think I can finish it now.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018s no skin off my back. I know you\u2019re usually a klutz, but dammit Deku, this is elementary stuff. Check your lines and operations, shithead.\u201d The fingers on his side squeezes in both reprimand and reminder. \u201cAnything else, strawberry?\u201d\nThen the air that\u2019s on the way to Izuku\u2019s lungs suddenly encounter a major roadblock, and the sound he makes afterwards is definitely something no normal person can produce.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Izuku manages to squeak, while the rest of his boyfriend\u2019s squad looks like they\u2019ve been given a severe dose of whiplash. \u2018Strawberry\u2019\u2026 is probably a good moniker for how Izuku looks right now. \u201cI\u2019m good. Thanks again.\u201d\n\u201cGood. Now fuck off so I can ream these motherfuckers out for not knowing the difference between art types and art periods.\u201d A quick nuzzle to the back of his ear, and Izuku is unceremoniously displaced from his post, but not ungently. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a long way to go before these idiots even get half of what I\u2019m sayin\u2019 right now.\u201d\n\u201cStrawberry,\u201d Kaminari states, utter delight dripping from every pore in his body, and Izuku takes the offered out, retreating quickly and strategically before the rest of their friends decide to pay attention to him instead.\nHe can still feel his heart pounding in his ears. A quick check in the window reveals Izuku\u2019s face, skin so brightly red that he might as well be sunburned.\nSome part of him still thinks his boyfriend is doing this to tease Izuku. Why wouldn\u2019t he, when Izuku reacts like this, so openly and blatantly, unable to hide every emotion as it appears on his face?\nIzuku knows that if he sincerely asks, Kacchan will stop. He isn\u2019t that person in middle school anymore who disregards Izuku\u2019s wishes and wants, and if it is truly uncomfortable for him, his boyfriend will go back to how he usually is, no ifs, buts or questions about it.\nBut the thing is\u2026 Izuku is far from bothered by it.\nHe shouldn\u2019t be this happy. It feels wrong, somehow, to feel this elated, like he can walk on air the moment those casual, insignificant names escape the blond\u2019s lips. It just feels so good, to have those small but tangible proofs of Kacchan\u2019s affection for him, that what they are feeling for each other is reciprocated, as real as the sky above and as concrete as the earth below their feet.\nEven now, Izuku sees as he looks at his reflection, he can\u2019t stop smiling, cheeks already aching from the stretch of his mouth.\nHe shouldn\u2019t get used to this. If he does there\u2019s no turning back. Kacchan is\u2026 Kacchan. His words don\u2019t matter as much as his actions do, and if Izuku lets himself get carried away there\u2019s no saving his dignity and his self-worth, especially if his boyfriend decides to randomly stop one day.\nIzuku would have to start taking meds soon. Perhaps go to Recovery Girl later for a check up, just to make sure?\nBecause he\u2019s feeling a literal heartache right now, and his boyfriend will take a toll on his health and sanity if he doesn\u2019t get a hold of himself.\nBut again, exceeding all expectations, once the fiery explosion that is Izuku\u2019s boyfriend gets started, there\u2019s no stopping him any time soon.\n\u201cWhat the fuck was that, freckles?!\u201d Kacchan snarls over the communicator they were using for today\u2019s Heroics class. For this lesson, it\u2019s a joint training session with Class B at Ground Beta, and Izuku already regrets ever getting himself at this point in his school life. \u201cI saw that pussy-ass attempt at a Manchester Smash! If you let Copycat Bitch take you out this early I\u2019ll murder you myself, Deku!\u201d\n\u201cBit busy right now trying not to lose, Dynamight!\u201d Izuku yells back, even as his classmates cooed and cackled and heckled over the shared communication line. The moment it catches on to the rest of their friends that Katsuki is, apparently, an endearment type of guy, they have never lived it down since, and have taken every spare moment to continuously remind them of it. \u201cPlease stop distracting me!\u201d\nWell, Izuku at least; his boyfriend doesn\u2019t seem bothered by all the poking fun at his expense. In fact, he seems to take pride in it instead, deadpanning those who attempted to tease him that he likes, ignoring those that he tolerates, and flat out attempting to blow up those he doesn\u2019t.\n(\u201cYou chucklefucks are just jealous that I\u2019m in a relationship and you\u2019re not,\u201d he accuses smugly during one lunchtime when Kaminari tried to get a rise out of him again. \u201cGet on my fuckin\u2019 level, noobs!\u201d\n\u201cShit yeah, we really are,\u201d Sero sighs in the end, glum, while at the next table, Asui is whacking Izuku on the back, trying to dislodge the piece of tonkatsu that suddenly made itself a home in his throat.)\n\u201cBakugou, another word out of you about Midoriya and I will expel you,\u201d Aizawa growls threateningly through the receiver, and Izuku wonders whether it\u2019ll be too late to go and hurl himself at the side of the nearest building. Maybe the impact will help him disintegrate completely from the face of the earth.\nSure, All Might will be supremely disappointed in him, but he\u2019s willing to take the feelings of crushing dismay and failure from his mentor if it means escaping this bubbly, embarrassing giddiness that\u2019s spreading in the pit of his stomach.\n\u201cOya, associating ourselves with the riff raff, are we?\u201d Monoma simpers from the building across from where he\u2019s perched on the window. That\u2019s right, Class B can also hear everything that\u2019s going on, and Izuku kind of wants to kick a hole on the concrete and bury himself underground for a few hours, at least until the intense urge to come up to his boyfriend and press kisses on his face completely disappears.\nNo, Izuku bad. He\u2019s in class right now, training to be a hero and surrounded by a lot of powerful, destructive quirks. Monoma and his team deserve his complete attention, at least if he wants to win, and Izuku rushes forward.\n\u201cPlease stop talking about Kacc\u2014 Bakugou like that, Monoma-kun.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s really no accounting for taste when it comes to you, is there?\u201d Pale blue eyes roamed over his form, thin lips curled into a sneer of distaste as Monoma dodges.\nIzuku, who has seen true hate on another person\u2019s face before, barely flinches and readies another attack.\n\u201cA pity, Deku, that you choose to lower yourself with the likes of those will only bring an end to others because of their selfishness.\u201d Monoma drones on, forehead twitching a little at Izuku\u2019s non-response. \u201cBakugou should consider himself lucky he isn\u2019t expelled. Or perhaps because he\u2019s merely bidding his time before he finally switches over to the side of the villains?\u201d\nIzuku freezes. Distantly, he hears Shouji whisper into his microphone.\n\u201cOh, shit.\u201d \nIzuku turns to the blond slowly, tendrils of teal-colored lightning skating down his thighs and biceps, the sudden surge of One-for-All throughout his body displacing the nearby air and turning them razor sharp as concrete cracked under his steel-toed boots.\n\u201cMonoma-kun, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Izuku starts in a calm, cheerful voice, but his eyes are anything but as he considers his opponent carefully. Monoma can\u2019t Copy his quirk, not completely, and during that first discovery Izuku has been nothing but relieved since it meant that the other isn\u2019t in danger of losing his limbs anytime soon.\nThis time, however, Izuku would love nothing more than to have his quirk separate Monoma\u2019s head from his body. Permanently.\nHe takes his stance, lowering his center of gravity and putting one foot forward as he directs Full Cowling towards his legs in preparation for his Shoot Style.\n\u201cBut I\u2019m going to stop holding back on you now, not until you take back what you said.\u201d He doesn\u2019t raise his voice one bit, but the cold fury in his tone is palpable, and enough to set off any self-preservation alarms.\nAnd Monoma, bless his little black heart, has realized it too, based on the grimace on his face.\nBecause no one talks badly about Bakugou Katsuki in front of Midoriya Izuku and walks away.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing, trying to provoke me like that, but it worked, Monoma-kun. If you want a fight, then I\u2019ll give you one.\u201d\n\u201cProblem child,\u201d Aizawa sighs from the control room as Izuku launches on the offensive, \u201ctry not to kill him.\u201d\n\u201cI make no promises, Aizawa-sensei.\u201d\n\u201cFuck yeah!\u201d Izuku hears his boyfriend cheer on from the sidelines, and feels his chest grow warm. \u201cThat's what I'm fuckin' talking about! You got this shit, go kick his ass, doll!\u201d\n\u201cBakugou Katsuki!\u201d \n\u201cCome on sensei, let Deku-kun protect his man!\u201d Uraraka piped up, indignant. \u201cIf you talk shit, you get hit! Monoma has it coming sir, you can clearly see that!\u201d \n\u201cSee, Round Face gets it,\u201d his boyfriend agrees, sounding smug, and Izuku hears the familiar slap of hands meeting in a high-five.\nAnd no, he still doesn\u2019t know how his boyfriend and once-crush became such good friends.\n(\u201cNone of your damned business, Deku,\u201d Kacchan answered rather severely when Izuku managed to ask. \u201cMe an\u2019 Round Face just have a lot in common, \u2018s all.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Uraraka chirped, exchanging a meaningful look with the blond that made Izuku think that it was probably better to leave his questioning where it is.\nAs long as they\u2019re not fighting, Izuku will accept it.)\n\u201cHeroes should not be provoked into attacking because of something someone said to them!\u201d Aizawa growls back, but he still sounds like he needs to sleep like, a day ago.\n\u201cWith all due respect sensei, what Monoma-kun is saying about Bakugou-kun is close to slander, and he doesn\u2019t need to hear something like that from a future colleague.\u201d Iida says unexpectedly, and Izuku finds himself a little touched that the normally stiff teen is making attempts to get along with his boyfriend. They would probably never be friends, their personalities just don\u2019t get along that well, but Izuku is thankful Iida is trying, nevertheless.\n\n\u201cThe fuck? I don\u2019t need you speakin\u2019 up for me, Four Eyes!\u201d\n\n\u201cStill, I never thought I\u2019d see the day when Bakugou is properly encouraging towards someone else,\u201d Jirou comments lightly, sounding more than a little awed. \u201cMidoriya\u2019s a miracle worker.\u201d\n\n\u201cPipe the fuck down, Floppy Ears!\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the last time, it\u2019s Jirou and I know you know that, Bakugou!\u201d\nIzuku\u2026 might have blanked out for the rest of it, concentrating on chasing Monoma and the rest of his teammates down. While he does want to win in general, now it\u2019s an absolute necessity, because he will never let anyone speak badly of his Kacchan, no matter who it is.\nIn the end, his team demolishes Monoma\u2019s, but only in the best of ways: calculated and precise, with no unnecessary damage to the surroundings and all given objectives fulfilled. Even Aizawa doesn\u2019t have anything left to say, waving them off with a thumbs up, and Izuku bounds back to the waiting area, significantly more calm and back to his usual self.\nAll at once, his friends converge, congratulating them on the win, and Izuku smiles back, happy to share the victory with the rest of the class. But the one that he wants to hear from the most is still silent, and once the crowd disperses, he quickly approaches the lone figure wrapped in black, orange, and green, standing a ways from the rest of the group.\nIzuku carefully peers into a bandana-covered face, carefully expectant.\n\u201cHow did I do, Kacchan?\u201d\nBright crimson irises flickered up to meet his own, twin rubies glittering amongst the surrounding darkness. After a moment, the blond straightens out from his slouched position, a gauntlet-covered hand grasping Izuku\u2019s arm and tugging him out of the room, away from the direct line of sight of anyone else.\nIzuku\u2019s slowing heartbeat picks up its pace again when he\u2019s crowded against the nearest wall, suddenly aware of the sweat still dripping down his neck, the dust and grime still covering his body, the fact that their teacher and class are just a few meters away\u2014\n\u201cKacchan, we shouldn\u2019t\u2014!\u201d\nGloved thumbs and forefingers gently catch skin between them and instantly pulls, stretching Izuku\u2019s cheeks to its absolute limit.\n\u201cThe fuck you think I was gonna do, huh, perv?\u201d The grin on his boyfriend\u2019s face can rival a thousand suns as he continues to pinch Izuku\u2019s face, his expression quietly approving. \u201cRelax. I ain\u2019t gonna touch you, you\u2019re fuckin\u2019 filthy. Just wanna get some damn peace and quiet \u2018fore I get called in.\u201d\nIzuku blushes at his assumptions. It\u2019s not his fault that he\u2019s been conditioned to think that way! \u201cKacchan!\u201d Nevertheless, Izuku beams, pleased by the, in his boyfriend\u2019s standards, very high praise. \u201cOw! Hursch! Leggo!\u201d His own comes up to cover larger ones, trying to stop the abuse being heaped onto his poor freckles.\nAfter a few more seconds, his cheeks are released, the muscles sore from the pressure. Izuku rubs at it, trying to take the sting off, until he finds himself being drawn upward, his jaw cradled in warmed, porous gloves, his head tipped back as a mouth is brushed against his lightly chapped lips.\nIt was light, gentle, a flutter of butterfly wings, so unlike the person who is now holding him in his hands. Izuku presses back, silent and just as careful, now finally able to relish in the triumph he has worked hard for.\nKacchan draws back with a harsh exhale, their foreheads touching as Izuku forces his eyes to open, only to meet blood-tinged irises, similarly wide and dark and blown open.\n\u201cThat was inspired, baby, you have no idea.\u201d Kisses rained down on his face, from top to bottom, each one subtly harder than the last. Izuku giggles, tilting his head back as he was helplessly spoiled by his beloved. His hands circled around Kacchan\u2019s waist, only able to hold on, and there was a pang of regret that he\u2019s still wearing his full gauntlets, fingers twitching for full skin-to-skin contact.\n\u201cShit, you were just\u2026 you were perfect out there, gorgeous.\u201d His boyfriend\u2019s voice is hushed, reverent, pressing one final kiss on Izuku\u2019s mouth, so hard it almost bruised. \u201cFuckin\u2019 breathtaking.\u201d\nIzuku\u2019s breath hitches, warmth filling his cheeks as he suddenly feels uncharacteristically shy, mouth opening to justify his actions, even if no one was really looking for one.\n\u201cI can\u2019t let him\u2014 Monoma-kun is wrong about you, Kacchan. I had to\u2014 he was wrong.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t gotta protect me from assholes like him, darlin\u2019.\u201d Kacchan\u2019s voice is husky, warm and shamelessly indulgent as his thumb stroked at the pulse on Izuku\u2019s neck. \u201cGuys like him only know how to run their mouths. If they can\u2019t fuckin\u2019 take it, then they shouldn\u2019t dish it in the first place.\u201d\n\u201cI know, I know that,\u201d Izuku interrupts, forceful as his fingers wrap themselves around the material of his boyfriend\u2019s tank top, because he needs the love of his life to understand. \u201cBut\u2026 I can\u2019t do it.\u201d He shrugs, helpless, but not regretting his actions in the least.\nIzuku turns his gaze to his boyfriend then, letting him see his eyes, hard and uncompromising.\n\u201cI won\u2019t walk away. Not from that.\u201d\nAround his fingers, Izuku feels the blond\u2019s ribs suddenly constrict, air leaving his boyfriend in a rush as a stunned expression crosses the other\u2019s features, visible even through his mask.\nKacchan finally growls, low and seething, but the usual anger is non-existent as he lunges forward and bites under Izuku\u2019s jaw. \u201cYou precious little fuck. Who the hell do you think you are, doin\u2019 whatever you damn please?\u201d\nIzuku gasps, the sensation sharp and heated, and yanks his boyfriend closer in retaliation, gaze narrow as they stare at each other. \u201cI\u2019m yours,\u201d Izuku shoots back, fierce, \u201cbut you\u2019re also mine. So I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to take care of you too.\u201d\nInside the waiting area, the next group is called to the grounds. Silence. Izuku doesn\u2019t break eye contact, and neither does his boyfriend.\n\u201cKacchan, it\u2019s your team\u2019s turn. You should go.\u201d\nWith one last look, his boyfriend eventually pulls away first, taking a step back as he adjusts his grenade gauntlets back into a more proper position. \u201cTch. Stupid.\u201d But it doesn\u2019t stop him from running his fingers through Izuku\u2019s hair, curls now partly dry and fluffier to the touch.\nWith a firm tug, Izuku lets his head be coaxed up, forest meeting magma so they can be face-to-face once more.\n\u201cYou better watch me out there, Izuku.\u201d Kacchan rumbles, tone and expression fierce. \u201cDon\u2019t fuckin\u2019 tear your eyes away, no matter what.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve never looked away, not even once.\u201d Izuku admits, more breathless than intended. Because it\u2019s the truth; the moment his eyes landed on the blond he\u2019s never been able to force his gaze away, not back then, and especially not now. He can afford to be honest, and he has nothing to hide from the other.\nNot anymore.\n\u201cI will always be there to watch you win, Katsuki.\u201d\nThe smile he is gifted with is savage, bright, and beautiful, and with a final press of lips on his cheek, his boyfriend strides back into the room, getting his team together without looking back.\nAnd Izuku collapses back on the wall, fingertips touching his still lightly throbbing cheek as a small smile plays on his lips.\nIt\u2019s\u2026 too late, for him, probably.\nAnd yet\u2026\nIzuku can\u2019t find it in himself to feel the slightest hint of guilt.\nHe can\u2019t find anyone.\n\u201cKacchan!\u201d Izuku yells as he runs, head whipping in all directions. \u201cUraraka-san! Todoroki-kun! Everyone! Where are you?!\u201d The dread is sinking into his bones, turning his veins into ice and threatening to claw out of his skin. \u201cAnyone?! Answer me!\u201d\nBut anywhere he looks, what greets him is destruction. Unmoving bodies are littered carelessly on the broken ground, with buildings crumbling and streets filled with all kinds of wreckage.\n\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Izuku whispers as he races past another road, despair threatening to drown him with still no sign of his friends or anyone else.\n\u201cLooking for this, Deku?\u201d A chilling voice asks behind him, and he whirls around, ready to fight, only to meet a mountain.\nA mountain of human corpses, and his eyes widen in horror as he recognizes them.\n\u201cNo\u2026!\u201d\nTodoroki\u2019s evenly split white-red hair. Iida\u2019s helmet. Uraraka\u2019s pink hero costume. Asui\u2019s goggles.\n\u201cNO!\u201d\nAizawa\u2019s capture weapon, wrapped around a head with its eyes gouged out of its skull. His classmates, strewn around in various bits in pieces as their bodies pile up to serve as a makeshift staircase to the top, where someone awaits.\nAnd right there, right at the apex of the massacre, All Might\u2019s golden locks and frail body is distinct, underneath the feet of Shiragaki Tomura, sitting on a throne made out of bones, his deceptively frail-looking fingers wrapped around a pale throat, a familiar body limply hanging from his grip.\nIzuku can\u2019t think. He can\u2019t breathe. He\u2019s screaming inside his head, grief and agony ripping through his core as he faces the results of his complete and utter failure.\nHe\u2026 wasn\u2019t even able to save any of them\u2026!\n\u201cLooking for this?\u201d The villain drawls, shaking the person in his grip, the shredded tank top and broken arms swaying lightly alongside the wind that\u2019s tinged with the thick, sticky coppery smell of spilled blood. \u201cWell? Aren\u2019t you going to save him, hero?\u201d\n\u201cGive him back\u2026\u201d The terror and rage he feels is indescribable, and Izuku powers up One-for-All to its maximum power, not giving a fuck if it breaks his body in the process, as long as it meant taking the bastard down with him.\nIzuku can beg for forgiveness towards his loved ones in the next life, and he will bring Shiragaki\u2019s decapitated head alongside him as payment for his incompetence.\n\u201cGIVE HIM BACK, SHIRAGAKI!\u201d\nShiragaki grins lazily, and gives in to Izuku\u2019s shrieked demand, letting the man roll down from his perch, ending right in front of his feet.\nAnd what meets Izuku\u2019s horrified gaze are blank and unseeing garnet, Katsuki\u2019s dissolved neck letting his head roll back and face him completely.\n\u201cIZUKU!\u201d\nIzuku gasps, vision blurry as his eyes snap open, chest heaving and cold sweat and tears dripping down and sticking to his skin. The recognizable sizzle of ozone permeated the room, his entire body straining as the dark bedroom is lit up by the now volatile teal lightning of his quirk.\nAnd on top of him, straddling his legs and pinning his arms in place, was his boyfriend, with a bruise on his cheek and a set jaw, eyes alight with grim determination as he kept Izuku restrained with his entire weight.\nIzuku can\u2019t breathe, air leaving his chest in sharp bursts as his mind tries to reconcile what he\u2019s seeing from the nightmare he just had (it\u2019s just a dream, it\u2019s not real) just seconds ago.\nHis throat hurts, shredded raw and grating against his ears as he tries to speak.\n\u201cK-Katsuki\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. It\u2019s me, babe.\u201d Kacchan releases the hold immediately once he\u2019s cognizant, and takes Izuku\u2019s badly trembling hand, slamming it against his chest.\n\u201cFeel this. Concentrate.\u201d\nIzuku chokes, the refixed bones in his fingers aching from the sudden pressure applied to them, but his boyfriend refuses to let up even the slightest. Kacchan\u2026 actually looks scared, brows furrowed as he watches Izuku carefully but anxiously for any more signs of distress.\nBut once it finally sinks into his mind that what he\u2019s feeling under his palm is his boyfriend\u2019s heart, his active, still beating heart, racing as fast as his own\u2026\n\u201cI\u2019m here, Izuku.\u201d\nIzuku promptly bursts into tears.\n\u201cKacchan\u2026!\u201d\n\u201cShit, come here\u2014\u201d Izuku is hauled upwards, his face buried into his boyfriend\u2019s front as he\u2019s gathered in the blond\u2019s arms. Izuku bawls in earnest, unable to stop even if he tries, as the fear and tension bleeds out of him like a festering open wound.\nHe\u2019s always been a loud and messy crier. His mom has always been open with her emotions, and it\u2019s something he gets from her, with all the good and bad that comes along with it. He doesn\u2019t do it as often now, but with the career path he now chooses to lead, with the things he\u2019s gone through, his emotions have been exacerbated and amplified on both sides of the spectrum. Not just him, but with the rest of his classmates as well.\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for them to wake up in the middle of the night, woken up by someone else screaming somewhere inside the dorm rooms.\nOffering up the peace and quiet of their own minds; the price they pay to save people\u2019s lives.\nLike everything else, they developed a system to help each other cope. Some people only needed to be checked on by the doorway, others needed all-out sleepovers. Izuku is a mix of both, depending on how bad the dream was.\nAnd this one\u2026 is really, really bad.\nStrong arms wrap around him, keeping him tucked under a chin and against a study chest. For a moment Izuku feels lost, wondering how his boyfriend got there so quickly until he remembered that the blond was sleeping over in his room since it\u2019s the weekend and they wanted to go on a morning run together. Izuku might have bulked up a lot but Kacchan is still broader, and the way Izuku can just\u2026 sag against him with the knowledge that the blond can still keep him together when he\u2019s on the verge of breaking apart, that he can wholly depend on Kacchan right now to be strong when he feels so weak\u2026 is extremely comforting.\nSo Izuku continues to wail, limbs wrapped around his boyfriend like a too-sticky octopus. Blunt nails dig into muscled shoulder blades harshly, but Izuku can\u2019t bring himself to care, wanting to embed himself so deeply in the other there wouldn\u2019t be any start or end to either of them.\nMaybe then the visions he saw, his worst fears, won\u2019t become reality\u2014\nIzuku flinches, and a hand cradles the back of his head, smoothing down the curls sticking out from the back, another running up and down his back, tracing over the knobs of his spine in soothing, repetitive motions as Kacchan continues to murmur into his ear.\n\u201cShh, it\u2019s okay. Breathe, sweetheart. It\u2019s just a dream, it\u2019s not real, you\u2019re here, you\u2019re with me\u2026\u201d\nThe words are said softly, again and again like a prayer, its steady, unchanging cadence dulling the panic that still wrapped around Izuku\u2019s senses. Eventually, like pulling teeth, Izuku\u2019s body unravels, his sobs becoming more and more quiet as the minutes pass, until his body simply can\u2019t cry anymore.\nHis head flops against Kacchan\u2019s shoulder, exhausted and spent. All throughout, his boyfriend didn\u2019t say a thing unless it\u2019s to assure and comfort, and Izuku is glad for the darkness and silence that covers them both, trying to wipe at his swollen eyes and runny nose.\n\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d Izuku mutters, the first words since he\u2019s properly woken up, and cringes at the sound. It\u2019s like he just gargled broken glass, and judging from the displeased sound from the other, Kacchan is not happy hearing it.\n\u201cAss o\u2019clock in the morning\u2014 I don\u2019t fucking know.\u201d His boyfriend lets out an irritated sigh. \u201cShit. We need some light in here.\u201d He reaches for something behind Izuku, keeping a hand on his back as the bedside lamp on top of Izuku\u2019s headboard flickers on.\nThe room is bathed in a warm glow, and Izuku takes a moment for his eyes to adjust to the sudden light.\nAnd when it finally does, the aftermath is worse than he imagines.\n\u201cKacchan! Your face! I\u2019m so sorry, did I do that?!\u201d Izuku frets, upset at the sight of the other\u2019s swelling cheek. His hand hovers over the damage, ignoring the twinge of pain in his throat. \u201cWhat happened?! Did I attack you while we were asleep?!\u201d\n\u201cJust a lucky shot. \u2018s nothing, heroics class is worse,\u201d his boyfriend grunts back, \u201cand shut the fuck up, you sound like roadkill.\u201d Kacchan\u2019s palm roughly rubs at Izuku\u2019s cheek, removing the tear tracks that remained. \u201cWhat\u2019s your number? Use your hands, for fuck\u2019s sake.\u201d\nIzuku raises said appendages to let the other know of his general well-being, 1 for bad, 10 for good, when suddenly, a few sharp raps at the door. They both tense up, Izuku once again gathered back and shielded by his boyfriend\u2019s body as Kacchan\u2019s head jerks sharply at the direction of the door, a dog catching a whiff of a powerful scent.\n\u201cYou should go and see who it is,\u201d Izuku eventually croaks out when the knocks don\u2019t stop. As much as he appreciates Kacchan\u2019s protectiveness, he isn\u2019t going to fall apart if the blond needs to leave for a short moment. Not anymore, at least. \u201cIt\u2019s probably one of the people on my floor, I have to let them know\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI thought I told you to stop talking, asshole! Fucking\u2014\u201d Kacchan snarls, hands groping around Izuku\u2019s bedsheets, tipping Izuku towards himself so he can snag the blanket trapped beneath their legs. \u201cCan\u2019t you think of yourself for once, shitty nerd?!\u201d\n\u201cI must have disturbed some people tonight,\u201d Izuku continues to insist, obedient and compliant as the All Might blanket is expertly and methodically wrapped around his body like a burrito. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine, I\u2019m okay now. Can you please just apologize for me, Kacchan?\u201d\n\u201cFor the love of\u2014 fine!\u201d His boyfriend hisses back, setting Izuku at the juncture of his bed and bedroom wall, warm, snug and tucked in securely, as well as giving him a complete line of sight for all potential access points. \u201cFive minutes. Count if you gotta. You ready?\u201d\n\u201cYes, just go Kacchan\u2014\u201d The doorknob is rattling now, and Izuku would rather not replace his door lock again within the span of three months.\nWith a final curse, Kacchan climbs off the bed, striding towards the entrance as fast as he could, disappearing from Izuku\u2019s sight as the door is finally thrown open.\n\u201cThe fuck do you want?\u201d\n\u201cBakugou?\u201d Tokoyami\u2019s deep voice sounds surprised. \u201cWhat are you doing here? You shouldn\u2019t be in Midoriya\u2019s room\u2014\u201d\n\u201cCut the crap Feather Face, I am not in the mood,\u201d Kacchan cuts in testily, a foot constantly tapping near the doorway. \u201cOut with it. Whaddya want?\u201d\nThere is a considering pause before Tokoyami speaks again, this time around with a note of worry.\n\u201cDark Shadow and I heard Midoriya screaming earlier\u2014\u201d Izuku flinches, remembering with crystal clarity the bright red seeping from the cracks in between his and Koda\u2019s broken bodies, squelching against his boots. \u201cAnd Dark Shadow tells me that the darkness has encroached while Midoriya lays prone and defenseless. Is he all right?\u201d\n\u201cNightmare,\u201d Kacchan answers gruffly, with a dull thump against the doorframe. \u201cYou know how it is, Feather Face. Don\u2019t worry, \u2018m on it. Deku says sorry an\u2019 shit.\u201d\n\u201cUnderstandable.\u201d Izuku can almost see the incline of Tokoyami\u2019s beak as he answers. \u201cTell Midoriya there is nothing to forgive. Is there anything we can do to help?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026 Water. Lots of it. And if you meet any extras on the way you can tell them if they need to know.\u201d\n\u201cCertainly. I\u2019ll retrieve the necessities you\u2019ve requested quickly.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever. Also, why\u2019re you here? Isn\u2019t your room like, two doors over?\u201d\n\u201cMineta and Aoyama are deep sleepers, and Dark Shadow has always been more sensitive to the negative emotions in the atmosphere,\u201d Tokoyami answers blandly. \u201cIt is not the first time I\u2019ve been privy to Midoriya\u2019s confrontations with the monsters that make their home in the abyss.\u201d\n\u201cTch.\u201d A moment of silence, then Kacchan\u2019s voice again, this time lower. But it\u2019s not enough to escape Izuku\u2019s One-for-All-enhanced hearing. \u201cThis happen often?\u201d\n\u201cIf it does, then Midoriya makes no mention of it. He is strong. But\u2026\u201d Tokoyami hesitates.\n\u201cHe chooses to fight his battles alone. It is a lonely existence. I think it is his way of showing care.\u201d A pause, then Tokoyami speaks again, this time stronger and more certain.\n\u201cBut he shouldn\u2019t have to. Not when we are also strong, and able to help him carry the burden that weighs heavily on his shoulders.\u201d\nThe silence that ensues is surprised, and Izuku doesn\u2019t blame his boyfriend; he is too, startled that other people can see through him so easily.\nAnd more than a little moved by Tokoyami\u2019s declaration; he hasn\u2019t talked to the other teen much, but it\u2019s nice to know that he considers Izuku a friend.\n\u201d\u2026 You know what, you\u2019re not actually useless,\u201d Kacchan eventually says, sounding begrudgingly impressed. \u201cGimme your name, Feather Face.\u201d\n\u201cTokoyami Fumikage. We\u2019ve only been in one class for more than a year, Bakugou.\u201d The deadpan note in Tokoyami\u2019s voice is more than enough to lift Izuku\u2019s spirits, an unbidden giggle slipping past his lips. \u201cLet me know if there is anything else I can assist with. If you are with Midoriya, then I can be assured that he will be in safe hands. I\u2019ll also get you something for your face, Bakugou.\u201d\n\u201cDamn fuckin\u2019 right. Now get, and make it quick.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not too soon before his boyfriend returns with Tokoyami\u2019s gathered items in his hands, under five minutes as promised. Izuku remains calm, the wrap doing its job with its lingering heat and weighted softness, as his boyfriend sits down on the edge of the bed, an ice pack already on his bruised cheek.\n\u201cDrink everything,\u201d Kacchan says gruffly, thrusting a liter of bottled water in Izuku\u2019s grasp. \u201cYou sound like shit and it\u2019ll help with the headache.\u201d\nIzuku doesn\u2019t ask how he knows, and takes the bottle quietly after the top is screwed off, taking small, measured sips. His throat is thankful for the liquid, its coolness also helping the throb in his temple recede a little as the blond stands guard, making sure every drop disappears down Izuku\u2019s gullet.\nIt\u2019s only when Izuku drains everything that Kacchan moves again, throwing the bottle in the trash and picking up Izuku from his spot, sheets and all, to settle with him, the other\u2019s back against the headboard as Izuku sits on his thighs, leaning sideways against his torso.\nIzuku, wanting to help, takes the ice pack instead, not even minding the ache that the chill causes on his fingers as he adjusts its place on his boyfriend\u2019s face.\nIt\u2019s only when they\u2019re fully situated that they manage to exhale in relief, Izuku curling up in the familiar warmth and scent of burnt caramel.\n\u201cKacchan,\u201d Izuku hiccups, utterly miserable as he snuffles against his boyfriend\u2019s neck. \u201c\u2018m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cThe fuck\u2019re you apologizing for?\u201d Kacchan looks down on him, brows wrinkled, hissing at the press of ice on his injuries. \u201cShit happens, ain\u2019t no one\u2019s fault. Feelin\u2019 better, sweets?\u201d\nA small sniffle as Izuku nods minutely. \u201c\u2026 Yeah. It\u2019s stupid, I know it\u2019s just a dream, but\u2014\u201d\n\u201cShut your mouth, this ain\u2019t stupid.\u201d Kacchan cuts him off with a glare. \u201cWe all get it. You ain\u2019t no special fuckin\u2019 snowflake. Get over yourself.\u201d\nThe harsh and crude words make Izuku smile. His bedside manner is terrible, but his boyfriend is trying to make him feel better, in his own way. \u201cI know that. Thank you for taking care of me.\u201d\nHis boyfriend scoffs, hands going under Izuku\u2019s knees and around his waist to shuffle him closer. \u201c\u2026 D\u2019you wanna talk \u2018bout it?\u201d\nIzuku shakes his head quickly, the sight of soulless red eyes still fresh in his mind. \u201cI can\u2019t, please don\u2019t make me say it.\u201d He begs, body once again turning rigid, because all that blood, All Might\u2019s body, Katsuki\u2019s corpse\u2014 \u201cI can\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u201cShit, okay, calm down. I won\u2019t ask anymore.\u201d Kacchan hushes him, rubbing at Izuku\u2019s back. \u201cSorry, baby. That bad?\u201d\nIzuku nods, shuddering out a breath as he tries to ground himself in the present. Because everything is fine, it\u2019s not real, and Kacchan is here.\nThat\u2019s the most important thing he should focus on.\n\u201c\u2026 Fine. But you gotta visit Hound Dog after. You know the rules.\u201d\nIzuku\u2019s head jerks out from under his boyfriend\u2019s chin as he looks at the blond beseechingly. \u201cBut\u2026 this hasn\u2019t happened in a while. I\u2019m fine, maybe it\u2019s just the stress\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThe rules are there for a reason, dipshit. Fuck, Izuku\u2014 you sounded like you were dying.\u201d Kacchan\u2019s voice breaks at the end. \u201cYou were screamin\u2019 like you were getting murdered and I couldn\u2019t do fuck all about it.\u201d\nIzuku\u2019s heart hurts, guilt crushing his chest as he looks at his boyfriend. \u201cKacchan\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou were fightin\u2019 me so hard I thought I gotta bring Aizawa here to keep you down. You were sayin\u2019 \u2018give him back\u2019.\u201d Kacchan\u2019s expression pinches, closing off as he forces himself to ask the rest of the question out.\n\u201cIs it the time when I was\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNO!\u201d Izuku blurts out, stopping the guilt before it can have the chance to appear. \u201cGod, Kacchan, no. It\u2019s not\u2014 I haven\u2019t dreamt of that in a long time,\u201d he answers truthfully. \u201cThis is something\u2026 different. Worse.\u201d The culmination of Izuku\u2019s worst fears in one gory, mangled mockery of his childhood dream. \u201cBut like you said. It\u2019s a dream. It\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d Izuku will die first before it even comes to pass. \u201cIt just\u2026 it\u2019s so vivid.\u201d\n\u201cNo shit. That\u2019s what nightmares are, idiot.\u201d Kacchan grumbles, knocking his head back against Izuku\u2019s headboard in exhaustion, taking the ice pack from Izuku\u2019s grip and throwing it towards the desk. \u201cThink you can sleep? We still have a few hours before daylight.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026 don\u2019t think I can,\u201d Izuku admits. He doesn\u2019t want to close his eyes, terrified that he will be dragged into the same scene again. He can feel that the image of his boyfriend in that way will star in his future nightmares for the next few months. \u201cYou should sleep, Kacchan.\u201d He says instead, voice growing soft. \u201cAs long as I can still feel this,\u201d he raises his hand to the blond\u2019s heart, separated by layers of clothing and bedding. \u201cI\u2019ll be okay.\u201d\nHis boyfriend replies by harshly nipping the tip of his ear, making Izuku squeak. \u201cStubborn little bunny,\u201d the blond growls into his ear. \u201cYou think I can\u2019t stay up with you? Is that it, doll?\u201d\n\u201cN-No! That\u2019s not it!\u201d Izuku exclaims, making sure to keep his voice low. They lucked out with Tokoyami, the other teen isn\u2019t likely to gossip about Kacchan being in Izuku\u2019s room for the night, but they won\u2019t be as lucky next time if it was Aoyama who wakes up next, or god forbid, Mineta. \u201cYou want to run this morning, right? So you should get some more rest!\u201d\n\u201cTough, \u2018cause that ain\u2019t happenin\u2019 anymore,\u201d his boyfriend snarks as he starts to slide back down to the mattress, dragging Izuku along with him so they\u2019re both laying down again. Izuku\u2019s blankets are loosened around him and thrown over Kacchan\u2019s body instead, both of them now under the covers as Izuku\u2019s entire body is pressed against the other's side. \u201cYou\u2019re gettin\u2019 some sleep. No fuckin\u2019 way you can go out after all that.\u201d\nIzuku\u2019s head shoots up, betrayed. \u201cB-But Kacchan!\u201d\n\u201cNo buts! Knowing you, you\u2019ll trip all over yourself on the trail at this rate, you klutz!\u201d An arm wraps itself around Izuku\u2019s shoulder as his head is shoved against the blond\u2019s collarbone. \u201c\u2018Sides, you\u2019re going to Hound Dog later today. So suck it up, babe.\u201d\nIzuku huffs, settling back down on his bed because his boyfriend is right, Izuku isn\u2019t up for any physical activity today. He\u2019s exhausted, but his mind just won\u2019t stop working, still apprehensive, still unsure and scared.\nAt least, until what his boyfriend said to him mere moments ago filtered through his brain, innocuous in its command, but strangely resonating with clarity inside Izuku\u2019s soul.\nIzuku feels a wry smile tug on his lips.\nSuck it up, huh.\nA simple, if indelicate, solution for everything that\u2019s happening in life.\nTranquil silence.\n\u201c\u2026 Kacchan.\u201d\nA grunt. \u201cWhat.\u201d\nIzuku wiggles as closely as he can, hesitant for just the shortest moment as he throws an arm around his boyfriend\u2019s middle. Insurance, just in case. \u201cJust\u2014 I just wanna say, that\u2014 um, please don\u2019t be mad but\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOi! The hell?\u201d Kacchan exhales sharply, a sign of his dwindling patience and rising frustration. Fingers come up to tweak at Izuku\u2019s curls. \u201cFuckin\u2019 shit\u2014 Japanese, Deku. Use it.\u201d\n\u201cT-The pet names!\u201d Izuku shrieks into the blond\u2019s tank top, feeling his blush rise right up to his ears. \u201cJ-Just wanted to l-let you know. I l-like it. It feels nice.\u201d\nIzuku feels the other freeze, the fingers in his scalp stopping, and braces himself for the inevitable explosion.\n\u201cHaah?!\u201d The heat that flares from the blond\u2019s body is palpable, even to Izuku\u2019s duller sense of touch. \u201cWhere the hell did that come from, shitnerd?!\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d Izuku warbles, thoroughly embarrassed but unable to back down anymore. He clings tighter around the other\u2019s ribcage, on the off chance that it will save him from a literal explosion. He likes these sheets, thank you! \u201cShh, Kacchan, people are sleeping! But I just needed to let you know!\u201d\n\u201cThen stop bein\u2019 so embarrassing in the middle of the night, Deku!\u201d His boyfriend yells back, tone equally as mortified, putting Izuku\u2019s head in a headlock and throwing him around. \u201cFuck you!\u201d\n\u201cHie! I\u2019m sorry!\u201d Their minor scuffle ends with Izuku landing on top of the blond, a palm slapped over the other\u2019s mouth to stifle the noises he was making, taking care not to aggravate the bruise on the other\u2019s cheek.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d His boyfriend grunts when they finally stop and quiet down, too tired to continue roughhousing. The warmth of his boyfriend\u2019s body underneath his own feels just perfect, and Izuku resists the temptation to just flop forward and furl onto himself like a cat. \u201cYou want me to stop?\u201d\nIzuku immediately shakes his head. \u201cI just told you I l-liked it.\u201d He mutters, unable to look his boyfriend in the eye as crimson stains his cheeks. \u201cWhy would I ask you to stop? Just\u2026 \u201d he trains his gaze everywhere, anywhere other than the person in front of him.\n\u201cP-Please don\u2019t do it so much? My heart c-can\u2019t take it.\u201d\nThe blond becomes contemplative, the warm glow of the lamplight intensifying his surprisingly delicate features. Ruby-colored eyes glimmered in the dim light, studying Izuku\u2019s face carefully, for any hint of a falsehood or lie.\nThen, Izuku feels Kacchan\u2019s lips growing wide, captivating and intent and wicked, taking Izuku\u2019s hand off his mouth.\nThe look spells nothing but trouble for Izuku in the future.\n\u201cThen\u2026\u201d The blond drawls, bringing a chill down Izuku\u2019s back as his stomach clenched, both in dread and terrible anticipation.\n\u201cYour heart better be strong enough for next time, darlin\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cOh god I\u2019m so late for my training with All Might!\u201d Izuku cries as he dashes in the common room a week later, startling the classmates who are downstairs as well, enjoying their weekend. \u201cKacchan, why didn\u2019t you wake me up?!\u201d\n\u201cNot my fault you didn\u2019t set your alarm for this, dipshit!\u201d His boyfriend barks back, lounging on the counter with his mug of Jade Leaf Macha (a gift from Yaoyorozu, because no one else can afford it on a daily basis). \u201cHurry up doll, don\u2019t keep All Might waiting!\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t, just give me a sec!\u201d Izuku tears through the kitchen, getting a bottle of Bocari from the fridge and a piece of leftover toast from this morning\u2019s breakfast. Kacchan will definitely get on his case about not getting proper food especially before training, but they can definitely agree on the retired Hero being a top priority.\n\u201cOi! Aren\u2019t you forgettin\u2019 something?!\u201d\nIzuku quickly runs through the mental list in his mind, checking if there\u2019s anything he missed. Towel. Sports drink. Training attire, notebook, pen, phone.\nBut Kacchan still looks expectant, staring at him with a raised eyebrow.\n\u201cOh, right!\u201d Izuku comes up to the blond and leans upward on his toes to give him a quick smooch on the cheek. The other stumbles a little, almost losing his grip on his mug as Izuku exits the area. \u201cBye honey, love you, see you later!\u201d\nIzuku dashes through the rest of the rooms and out the front doors without waiting for a response. He\u2019s a little confused with the sudden burst of mayhem behind his back, but resolving to ask his boyfriend about it later.\nIt\u2019s a little embarrassing, Izuku thinks as he crams the bread into his mouth, jogging towards the meeting spot, to pull that on his boyfriend so suddenly without warning.\nBut if Kacchan can give him all sorts of cute, romantic names, then Izuku can also do the same. He\u2019s given up, this will be A Thing for the both of them from now on, and all Izuku can do now is to roll with the punches and enjoy it for as long as he can.\nAfter all, all\u2019s fair in love and war\u2026 right?\n(Inside the Class A dorms, the people downstairs who saw everything go down continue to jeer and cackle towards Bakugou Katsuki, who is leaning against the counter, a hand pressed to his face, the visible skin from his neck upwards a deep, violent shade of red.\nNear his elbow, there is a medium-sized box covered in cloth, the edges tied together in a rough bow that can also serve as a handle for the homemade lunchbox.\n\u201c\u2026 I meant the food, you idiot.\u201d\nThe sound of noodles being slurped up to a hungry mouth. \u201cGetting a taste of your own medicine doesn\u2019t feel nice, does it, ladykiller?\u201d\n\u201cShut the fuck up, Half-n-Half asshole.\u201d)"
