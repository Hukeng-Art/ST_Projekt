    "text": "*\n\u201cIt\u2019s not physical, Draco.\u201d\n\u201cBut...It has to be.\u201d\n\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t.\u201d The Healer sighs, placing the papers down on the desk between them. \u201cWe discussed this being a possibility, given what you\u2019d outlined to us as the problem in your first appointment, your symptoms. Your pre-existing\u2026condition.\u201d He folds his hands, delicately, rubs at an ink smudge on his knuckle. He smiles, and it\u2019s meant to be kind, understanding. Draco\u2019s lip curls, his fists clenching. \n\u201cIt has to be something physical.\u201d\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t bare your teeth at me.\u201d The Healer laughs, and Draco wishes he could remember his name so he could curse it. \u201cNo, we\u2019ve got the results of last night\u2019s examination, and all physical function is perfectly normal,\u201d he smiles again, the patronising fucker, \u201cwhich means the cause of your problem is mental.\u201d He taps the side of his head with one finger, as if Draco might not understand what he\u2019s saying, and Draco is ready to snap. He was ready before he sat down in this sterile and medicinally bland room and Mr I Think You\u2019re a Dumbarse is not helping. \n\u201cSo,\u201d the Healer continues, fixing Draco with his soft brown gaze, \u201cit is now my pleasure to refer you to someone else, who can help you with this situation.\u201d \nHe hands Draco a card, small and embossed with a name and floor, and before Draco can reply he\u2019s ushering him out the door and into the elevator. \n\u201cMind Healer,\u201d Draco reads unhappily when he arrives at his floor, as he stands in front of the white door. \u201cFucking hell. This is not what I came here for.\u201d \nHe turns and is about to leave, when he stops. He thinks of Pansy\u2019s worried face as she made him swear to find out what was wrong with him, after he passed out in the shop\u2019s small bathroom in summer. He thinks of the heavy bags under his eyes, the sleepless nights, the worsening fatigue. He thinks of his mother, urging him to take care of himself, even though she doesn't really understand, and still tears up whenever she remembers what he is now. It\u2019s hard for her, born and raised with the idea of blood purity as being so important, and precious, to reconcile that with what her son is now. She still hasn\u2019t really come to terms with what Fenrir did to him. His father can\u2019t even say the word out loud, his lips pursing on the \u2018we \u2015\u2019 before they pinch together, as he stares into his drink and they all change the subject. \nSometimes, Draco suspects he hasn\u2019t really come to that good a terms with it himself, but he\u2019s still miles ahead of the pair of them. It\u2019s less easy to pretend it doesn't exist, he supposes, when he\u2019s staring up at the moon longingly and downing a pint of Wolfsbane each month. It\u2019s been nearly eight years, after all. \nIt\u2019s even harder to ignore when he has to deal with the urges \u2015 the ruts \u2015 that happen four times year, like sweaty, randy clockwork. The last one was the worst he\u2019s had yet, the aftermath taking him off work for a week, and leaving him unfortunately unable to hide how unwell he was from Pansy. The downside of working with his best friend, he knows now, after nearly three months of her pestering him to get properly checked out. After she threatened to tell his mother how sick he really was, Draco finally caved. He\u2019s due for another rut in a fortnight, and perhaps the Healers can give him something to knock him out, so he can hibernate through this one. Hello Autumn, he thinks wryly. It always used to be his favourite season. \nRegardless, loitering in a hallway at St Mungo's like a pilchard isn\u2019t helping matters. Draco puffs his cheeks out, turning on his heel and taking the three steps back to the Mind Healer\u2019s door. He raps on it sharply. \nShe\u2019s nicer than he expects. \n\u201cDraco, is it?\u201d The Mind Healer extends one hand, and he shakes it. \u201cTake a seat. My name is Olivia,\u201d she introduces once he\u2019s sat down on the chair opposite her. There are no desks in here, in an attempt at informality, and the windows are open, potted plants on the sills and standing by a far wall. It\u2019s bright, and comforting, and Draco doesn\u2019t like it, the smell of Autumn\u2019s arrival wafting in through the open windows and making him antsy.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been referred to me from Healer Fitzpatrick,\u201d she says, looking into his file and nodding as she reads. \u201cHow did you find him?\u201d she asks. \n\u201cHorrible,\u201d Draco replies honestly, and she nods again without looking up. \n\u201cYes, he\u2019s got the bedside manner, as we say, of a troll.\u201d She meets his eyes, smiling sharply and Draco wonders if this is an empty attempt at currying favour, at earning his trust before she gleans his dark and humiliating secrets, but it doesn\u2019t seem like that. He finds he quite likes her, even though her office is too bright and cheerful, and the fact that there is a Self-Inking Quill poised to scratch out her analysis on the parchment on her small table to the left. He lets himself smile, wanly. \n\u201cYeah, total prick,\u201d he mumbles, sitting back in his chair. \u201cSo, what\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d he asks bluntly before he can get too comfortable. He feels tired, not well rested, even after a night spent in St Mungo\u2019s magical sleep lab as they took his magical readings, and then deduced, annoyingly, that he was fighting fit. He\u2019s frustrated by the morning he\u2019s wasted with this Fitzpatrick fellow, the smarmy git. \n\u201cYou lost consciousness in a bathroom at your place of work last season,\u201d she replies equally as bluntly, marking something off on his chart, and Draco is suddenly reminded of Pansy. He frowns. \n\u201cNo.\u201d His frown deepens at her raised brow. \u201cWell, yes, but it wasn\u2019t as bad as you make it sound, I just \u2015 \u201d \n\u201cAnd again, in spring, and three months before that. After the turn of each season,\u201d she says pointedly as she taps at the page with a short and brightly painted \u2015 fuschia \u2015 nail. \u201cIt says you were dizzy, disorientated and non-responsive when you were brought in, requiring IV fluids and overnight observation, before you discharged yourself.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Draco smiles, but it feels like more of a confused grimace, \u201cbecause I was feeling better.\u201d \n\u201cAnd before? In what way were you unwell?\u201d She flicks him a piercing look. \u201cDid something happen during your rut?\u201d\nDraco shifts against the soft black leather of the chair, unwilling to answer. She knows anyway, it\u2019s in his sodding chart. \u201cI don\u2019t see how the events at the turn of the seasons,\u201d he licks his lips, feeling a flush of embarrassed colour spread over his cheeks, \u201care really pertinent here.\u201d\n\u201cNo. But I do.\u201d She puts the chart down, fixing him with a keen look. \u201cIt\u2019s all connected.\u201d She folds he hands over her lap. \u201cWhich brings us to the matter at hand. And, I\u2019m afraid, some rather personal questions.\u201d\nThey are both silent for a long moment: the Mind Healer, searching Draco\u2019s face, and Draco, unsure of what the hell he should say. He doesn\u2019t like being stared at. \n\u201cDo you have any trouble achieving orgasm?\u201d she asks, soft and abrupt. \n\u201cMerlin.\u201d Draco looks at her, then away again quickly. \u201cNo, that. That\u2019s all fine.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d She hums. \u201cAnd when was the last time you were sexually active with another person?\u201d \nDraco folds his arms, unfolds them again. \u201cNot recently,\u201d he replies defensively. \n\u201cHow long ago is not recently?\u201d\n\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cFine, bloody \u2015\u201d Draco runs a hand over his jaw, as he thinks, his face heating. \u201cI think, roughly ten months.\u201d \n\u201cAnd your partner,\u201d Olivia crosses her ankles neatly, one behind the other, \u201cwere they lycanthrope, or \u2015\u201d\n\u201cHuman?\u201d Draco interrupts with a sneer. \n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t what I was going to say,\u201d she replies, her voice carefully even, devoid of emotion. But Draco can see that she\u2019s taken note of that response. The Self-Inking Quill scratches something furiously against the parchment and he stares at it, balefully. \nUnresolved issues regarding transformation, he imagines it might say, resentment towards magical medical personnel and terminology. Really, any Mind Healer worth their salt shouldn\u2019t be surprised by that, though. After the slew of bites and recently turned werewolves, that were left after Greyback and his companions\u2019 rampage after the war and before they were captured, wizarding kind had to adapt to a significantly increased lycanthropic population. They had gone from a small and mostly ignored minority, to a...well, larger and now mostly accepted and supported minority, but that came slowly, and there are still many pockets of society who were reluctant to get on board with that, with accepting the newly bitten and turned. It seemed the older, the purer the blood a person perceived they were in possession, and the less association they wanted to have with those in possession of a lycanthropic problem. \nDraco being turned was a slap in the face to his parents \u2015 and a deliberate one from Greyback, at that \u2015 and had all but ostracised the Malfoys from the self-declared eliter parts of society. Draco didn't mind; he wanted nothing to do with them, anymore, and if those who had quietly supported He Who Must Not be Named with their silence wanted to now shun Draco, he was all the gladder for it. It wasn\u2019t as if his family was on high society\u2019s Christmas card list anyway, after their actions in the war, as Draco had once yelled in his father\u2019s face during a particularly bad post-bite fight. He\u2019d busted his stitches, during that one, he recalled, the large wound on his side splitting open as he threw his glass at the wall. His mother had all but pulled him to bed, after that, glaring wordlessly as Lucius\u2019s stunned and silent face. \nHis father hadn\u2019t brought it up again, at least, Draco\u2019d thought with wry pleasure as he\u2019d let his mother redress his ribs. Merlin, everything about Greyback had to be over the top; even his bite wounds took forever to heal, resisting even the sturdiest of healing spells. His mother was quite deft at them, though, and proved marvellously resilient as well when Draco participated in an interview with the Prophet about werewolf rights, and their place in society. He\u2019d hated every second of it, but he felt he ought to at least try and do something to make life a little easier for those who, like him, had been affected \u2015 just in case anyone out there might be listening. The words I am not a coward, became his mantra as he answered question after question, as he made himself do this one brave thing, as he ignored the sting of the healing teeth marks in his side. \nJust one brave thing. \n\u201cAre you trying to read my notes?\u201d Olivia asks, snapping Draco back to attention. \n\u201cYes,\u201d he admits, trying to wrongfoot her with the truth. It doesn\u2019t quite work. \n\u201cI\u2019m afraid they won\u2019t make sense, unless you know Magi-wizard shorthand.\u201d Her smile is tight, professional, but her eyes are glinting with humour. \n\u201cThey were not turned,\u201d Draco says quietly after a moment, too tired to keep up his glaring match with the quill. \u201cMy last sexual partner.\u201d\n\u201cAnd your ruts?\u201d She asks, gently adjusting her glasses. \u201cHow many would you say you have a year?\u201d\nDracos\u2019s jaw tightens, as he slides a little lower in his chair. \u201cThe normal amount.\u201d\n\u201cSeasonal?\u201d\nDraco nods. \n\u201cAnd what do you do during them?\u201d\nDraco looks up sharply, then shrugs, pursing his lips. \n\u201cYou do nothing?\u201d She furrows her brow, but her expression isn\u2019t surprised. It\u2019s all in his charts; she\u2019s just teasing the information out of him. \u201cManagement is important, Draco.\u201d\n\u201cI manage them,\u201d he says, defensively, and he knows it\u2019s only half of a lie. \u201cI take the prescribed potions, and I wait them out, what else am I supposed to do?\u201d\n\u201cYou need to knot, Draco.\u201d\nThe room is filled with sudden, thick silence, as Draco tenses. \u201cI can\u2019t do that,\u201d he says hoarsely. \u201cWhich you know, because it is in that sodding chart I filled in yesterday, along with every other detail of my personal life down to, I don't know, my favourite bloody colour!\u201d \n\u201cYou can\u2019t knot, or you refuse to?\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t!\u201d he snaps. \u201cBut that\u2019s not why I\u2019m here, getting those tests, which are all useless anyway because Healer Fits-prick found nothing wrong with me \u2015\u201d\n\u201cPhysically, nothing is,\u201d Olivia confirms. \u201cThe symptoms are physical yes, but the cause is not. Physically, you are quite healthy. Mentally and magically, on the other hand?\u201d She looks at him seriously. \u201cThat, I believe, is the source of the malady.\u201d \nDraco inhales, shutting his eyes and trying to steady his racing heart. Frustration, anger, and a just a little bit of I told you so! from his inner Pansy mingle inside him as admitting out that doing that one basic thing that all Alphas do \u2015 knot their partners \u2015 is something he is incapable of. \n\u201cDraco. As an Alpha, you need to knot. The emotional, hormonal and chemical release is important for all aspects of your well being \u2015\u201d\n\u201cLook,\u201d he interrupts, moderating his tone, \u201cthat\u2019s all well and good, but it just doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d He leans forward. \u201cIt has never happened, with anyone, or not since \u2015\u201d He breaks off, then looks away, flushing slightly. Olivia's eyes narrow. \n\u201cNot since...?\u201d she prompts, staring at him intently from behind her wire-framed glasses. \u201cWhat about on your own?\u201d She glances back at the chart sitting open next to her. \u201cYou were turned at seventeen, sexually mature. You would have presented immediately, the change of the seasons affecting you as it does all werewolves. So, something\u2026.happened?\u201d\nDraco\u2019s mouth presses into a tight line, and he folds his arms across his chest, crosses one leg over the other. \n\u201cYes,\u201d is all he replies, refusing to elaborate. He doesn't want to talk about the night at the Manor, the sweat, the fever he\u2019d woken up with, the pain in his side and the wonderful throb between his legs. Most of all, he doesn\u2019t want to remember the blind panic he\u2019d felt when it happened, when he\u2019d slipped his hand down beneath his sheets and wrapped his fingers around his cock, and then around \u2015 that. \nAs if he hadn\u2019t felt like enough of a freak, like damaged and inhuman goods, already. \n\u201cI can tell by your face that you don\u2019t enjoy recalling this,\u201d Olivia says, pouring a stream of Aguamenti water into the tall glass by Draco\u2019s left side. \n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Draco lies. \u201cIt happened once,\u201d he confirms, \u201cbut hasn\u2019t happened since. It doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d he emphasises. By the time he\u2019d come to terms with his new status as a werewolf, his cock, it seemed, had lost all interest in knotting. Rut, no rut, it didn\u2019t matter; it never happened. \nOlivia hums thoughtfully \n\u201cI\u2019ve had partners,\u201d Draco goes on to say, running a hand through his hair in frustration, \u201cwolf, non-wolf, Omega, Beta, even bloody Alpha, and it just does. Not. Happen.\u201d\n\u201cAnd during a rut?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Draco sits back. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d he licks his dry lips, reaching for the water. He takes a long slow sip while Olivia watches him shrewdly. \u201cI don\u2019t have sex during those.\u201d\n\u201cNever?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cDo you masturbate?\u201d\n\u201cIf I must,\u201d Draco croaks. \n\u201cSo, you rely heavily on the suppressants in the days leading up to and on the night of a rut?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you have done so for eight years?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d Draco jiggles his foot impatiently. \n\u201cAnd then when you inevitably burn out, exhausted and magically depleted, right after these unfulfilled ruts, you tell yourself it\u2019s not connected, and you\u2019re just unwell?\u201d Her voice is not unkind, but it is far too honest, and Draco momentarily hates her. He glares. \n\u201cI don\u2019t see how that has anything to do with knotting.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d She smiles. \u201cThat\u2019s what Magi-Medical personnel are for, though. Making these connections.\u201d \nDraco\u2019s lip twitches as his eyes narrow further. Olivia just smirks back at him. \n\u201cSo knotting would fix this?\u201d he asks petulantly. \u201cThat\u2019s the miracle cure, is it?\u201d \nOlivia simply looks at him, then stands. \n\u201cWhat prompted you to finally come forward?\u201d She moves towards two tall filing cabinets at the back of the room, a large potted fern standing between them both. The quill and parchment follow her, still marking off indistinct symbols on the page as it hovers at shoulder height. \n\u201cMy,\u201d pain in the arse friend, \u201cco-worker suggested it,\u201d Draco says with a shrug, over-simplifying the situation. \n\u201cMiss Parkinson, is it?\u201d Olivia continues to rummage, leafing patiently through file after file as Draco watches her. \n\u201cCorrect.\u201d After a moment he adds, \u201cwe run a store together.\u201d\n\u201cA bookshop, yes?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d Draco frowns as she nods, finally retrieving the file she was after. \u201cShe\u2019s...my friend. My oldest friend.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s important,\u201d Olivia says sincerely, sitting down once more. The quill and parchment faithfully trail behind her, fluttering to a still and settling against the cushioned seat. \u201cPeople who support you are important.\u201d\nDraco fights not to roll his eyes. From her smile, Olivia looks like she can tell. \n\u201cSo. You\u2019re due for another rut in two weeks,\u201d she pronounces, and rolling his eyes starts to sound like an even better idea for Draco. \n\u201cYes, I know.\u201d Honestly, as if he didn\u2019t know that already. \n\u201cIt\u2019s important you don\u2019t spend it alone,\u201d she says, her voice growing quieter as it grows more serious. \u201cIt\u2019s important you don\u2019t use suppressants this time.\u201d\nDraco spreads his hands, lets them hit his thighs in exasperation. \n\u201cIf I don\u2019t use the suppressants, then I\u2019ll \u2015\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d she interjects kindly. \u201cYou will need companionship.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d he shakes his head, \u201cno, I spend ruts alone.\u201d\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s bad for you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve never spent one with someone.\u201d \n\u201cAnd it\u2019s bad for you,\u201d Olivia repeats. \u201cThe desire to mate won\u2019t go away, Draco.\u201d \n\u201cI don\u2019t want to mate,\u201d he hisses vehemently, wiping his sweating palms on his trousers. \n\u201cAs an Alpha, biologically, you do,\u201d she insists. \u201cYou\u2019ve ignored it this long, but never knotting, never spending a rut with a compatible Omega, it\u2019s...\u201d she shakes her head, and her expression is sympathetic. \u201cThat\u2019s what your body does four times a year, it needs that now, and your altered magic is right on board with it. The longer you ignore it, the more it damages you.\u201d\nDraco swallows. \u201cBut, suppressants \u2015\u201d \n\u201cYou can suppress it for so long, but not indefinitely.\u201d Draco sighs, and looks away, defeated, as she continues to talk. \u201cIt\u2019s making you ill. You need the release \u2015\u201d\n\u201cRelease,\u201d Draco scoffs. \n\u201c \u2015 magically, emotionally, mentally.\u201d Olivia smiles. \u201cYou are physically capable of knotting, but you need to spend a rut with someone who is compatible, who you are comfortable with.\u201d She spreads her hands. \u201cAnd knot them.\u201d\nDraco groans, frustrated \u2015 at her, at the task, at his own infuriating biology for causing this. \u201cAnd who, exactly, is going to provide that for me during this unsuppressed rut, huh?\u201d He pushes his hair back, smoothing it away from his face. \u201cGot a friend in mind, an Omega sex doll, what?\u201d \nHe looks away, face burning, but looks back when she hands him something. It\u2019s a small card, no name. Just an address, a Floo number to contact, and a description of the services offered. \nHe looks up at her with incredulous eyes.\n\u201cA Heat Companion?\u201d Draco\u2019s mouth turns down as he reads off the card. \u201cYou want me to see...a prostitute?\u201d \nFor the first time, Olivia laughs, and the sound is light, and sweet. \u201cMerlin, no, it is not that. Heat Companions provide a valuable and discreet service, for this very kind of situation.\u201d\n\u201cWerewolves with broken cocks?\u201d\nOlivia laughs again. \u201cYou\u2019re not broken, Draco. You just need...a little help. I\u2019d like you to meet with this person,\u201d she goes on. \u201cThey\u2019ve retired, but \u2015\u201d \n\u201cOh,\u201d Draco scoffs, shaking his head. \u201cGot a favour to call in, do you? I\u2019m a favour?\u201d he finishes unkindly.\n\u201cNo.\u201d She tilts her head, eying the file on her lap intently. \u201cNot like that. He\u2019s very good \u2015\u201d\n\u201cHe?\u201d \n\u201cYes.\u201d She looks up quickly, her brown curls around her face. \u201cIs that an issue? Your chart said\u2026\u201d She stops as Draco swallows, a little curl of shame trying to unwind inside him, but he shoves it away. \n\u201cThey\u2019re very invasive, aren\u2019t they. The questions we ask,\u201d she says softly. It\u2019s not an apology, but it is something, and Draco suddenly can put his finger on who she reminds him of, other than Pansy; Granger. Figures he\u2019d get saddled with a Mind Healer who is a combination of the only two women he\u2019s ever been properly scared of. He\u2019s expecting the Weaslette to burst in any minute now. \n\u201cNo, it\u2019s all right. He is...He is preferable,\u201d he says quietly. She smiles, and it\u2019s genuine. \n\u201cGood. I can arrange an initial meeting, for three days time.\u201d She rests her elbows on her knees, looking at him until she has his full attention. \u201cAs I was saying, he\u2019s not really Companioning anymore, he\u2019s retired mostly, but this is not a favour I\u2019m calling in.\u201d She straightens. \u201cI\u2019ll offer him the job, and he\u2019ll want to help here. He likes helping.\u201d She smiles at Draco\u2019s doubtful look. \u201cHe\u2019ll want to help you.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Draco asks skeptically. \n\u201cOh, you\u2019ll discuss that with him.\u201d Draco looks like he wants to argue, but she cuts him off. \u201cDraco, you are under no obligation to engage his services, or that of anyone like him. I\u2019d like you to go to the initial meeting, but that\u2019s all. Don\u2019t misunderstand me, this is the best and most effective method for dealing with this, but of course, if you\u2019re not comfortable with it.\u201d She clasps her hands together, then stands. \u201cThen we\u2019ll find other arrangements, other treatments.\u201d\nDraco looks down at the card. \u201cThree days\u2019 time?\u201d\n\u201cThree days\u2019 time,\u201d she repeats as Draco stands. She extends her hand for him to shake it, and he does so, cautiously. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not locked into anything,\u201d she adds, seeing his still wary expression. \u201cYou\u2019ll discuss it all with him.\u201d \nDraco lets go of her fingers, scheduling another time to meet her before he leaves. His heart feels heavy, his head light, as the steps into the lift taking him back to the Apparition points. It\u2019s the early onset of the lead-up to a rut already making itself known, and he\u2019s used to this. He rubs his temple, eyeing the small bin in the corner of the lift as he considers throwing the card away. It\u2019s stupid; he doesn't want to hire someone to fuck, and even if he did, it wouldn't help. He doesn\u2019t knot. His body can\u2019t, won\u2019t, whatever it is. Any time he\u2019s felt like it might happen, something's stopped him, held him back. Why the hell would an Omega Heat Companion change that? \nDraco runs the pad of his thumb over the embossed letters, stepping aside to let a woman and young child in. As the lift doors slide close in front of them with a gentle hum, Draco slips the card back into his pocket.\n*\n\u201cA Heat Companion?\u201d Pansy stirs her tea. \u201cCirce\u2019s soggy drawers, I didn\u2019t even know that was a thing.\u201d\n\u201cBlessed is the innocence of the unbitten,\u201d Draco replies, as he slips his last book into its place, then steps down from his wooden ladder. \u201cYou lead such untroubled lives.\u201d\n\u201cOh, come off it, Saint Malfoy.\u201d Pansy sets her tea down next to the till, folding her arms. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know it was a thing either.\u201d\nDraco sniffs. \u201cNo, true.\u201d He flicks her an amused gaze. \u201cI still don\u2019t think I do.\u201d\n\u201cSo it\u2019s someone who has a heat with you, while you have your quarterly\u2026\u201d Pansy waves her hand, then thrusts her hips in a lewd gesture. Draco makes a face at her. \n\u201cI\u2019m so grateful I have such sensitive friends.\u201d\n\u201cI know, I'm a treasure.\u201d She cups his cheek as he walks past, picking up another book form the pile of new stock they received. \u201cThat\u2019s what it is, though, yes?\u201d\n\u201cCorrect.\u201d Draco sighs, taking a sip of Pany\u2019s tea. He grimaces \u2015 too sweet \u2015 before he undoes the top button of his robes, exposing his throat. \u201cSomething like a sex therapist, I gather.\u201d\n\u201cVery hands on kind of therapy.\u201d\nDraco laughs. \u201cQuite.\u201d He rubs at his neck, his shoulder a little sore. \u201cHe\u2019s retired, apparently.\u201d\n\u201cWait, so,\u201d Pansy spins on the spot, leaning against a shelf, \u201che\u2019s old?\u201d\n\u201cMerlin, I hope not.\u201d Draco laughs again. \n\u201cAgeist,\u201d Pansy quips, grinning. \n\u201cYou shag him, then.\u201d Draco looks up at her from under the fall of his hair. It needs a cut, just a little on the too long side, but he\u2019ll do that in Autumn proper. He\u2019s too agitated for that this week.\n\u201cDarling, I don\u2019t need to,\u201d she leers, \u201cmy cock works just fine.\u201d\n\u201cOh, you have a cock now?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, top drawer.\u201d She grins, and it\u2019s salacious. \u201cBigger than yours, I\u2019d wager.\u201d\n\u201cI thought Millie was looking especially well-fucked these days.\u201d\n\u201cPfft,\u201d Pansy rocks on her heels. \u201cAs if I need a cock for that.\u201d\nShe winks, and Draco picks up a copy of Bezoars and Belligerence then tries to whack her on the arse with it. She giggles, and spins away. \n\u201cSo, when are you going to go and meet your geriatric paramour?\u201d\n\u201cMerlin. Tomorrow, unfortunately,\u201d Draco replies heavily. \n\u201cDon\u2019t look so glum, my love.\u201d Pansy steps closer, heels clicking on the bookshop\u2019s wooden floor. \u201cPerhaps it really will help?\u201d She looks at him sincerely, and Draco pats her hand. He still feels a little bad for scaring her last season, when he collapsed in the upstairs bathroom. \n\u201cYeah.\u201d He smiles, standing and kissing her forehead as he Summons his cloak. \u201cI\u2019m going to head off. Get my beauty sleep before \u2015\u201d He stops as the door to the stop jangles. \n\u201cWe\u2019re closed!\u201d he and Pansy both yell in unison. The figure at the door laughs. \n\u201cIt\u2019s only me! I\u2019ve come to talk with you about the encyclopedias we discussed the other day.\u201d\n\u201cOh, shit,\u201d Pansy frowns faintly, tossing her hair back. It\u2019s just long enough to skim her shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019s Ellie. I think I was drunk when I said we would stock her \u2015 No, don\u2019t leave!\u201d she pleads as Draco stands, heading towards the back of the shop. \n\u201cShe\u2019s your friend,\u201d he says in a deep, you brought this on yourself, tone. He continues walking backwards, to where he knows the Floo is, as Pansy glares at him. \n\u201cFine, abandon me. Go get your beauty sleep for your Heat Grandpa.\u201d She chuckles as Draco rolls his eyes, before he flips her two fingers. He would normally stay, have tea and an admittedly weird chat with Ellie, but he\u2019s tired, anxious, more apprehensive about tomorrow\u2019s meeting than he\u2019d like to admit. The rut is bearing down on him, getting closer and more tangible with every day, and he\u2019s more than aware that if it doesn\u2019t work out then he\u2019s up shit creek for the coming week. He\u2019s never weathered a rut without suppressants, and he\u2019s never been around an Omega in heat. He knows they follow the same seasonal phases as Alphas, four heats a year, that their desire to be fucked is as intense as that which Alphas feel, in reverse. At least, Draco assumes it is; he usually spends his ruts doped up to the eyeballs. \nHe\u2019s stepping into the flames before Pansy has the door open, falling into bed as soon as he can. He lies awake still, after a restless hour\u2019s contemplation on who this Companion might be, what they\u2019ll be like. Will they be tall, young, old, friendly. Handsome, or funny? He\u2019s dying to find out, and terrified at the same time, some instinct within him flexing its claws at the idea of an Omega while the rest of him tells it to shut up, and sit down. \nHe curls onto his side, wraps his arms around his pillow and imagines what it would be like to have company in a week\u2019s time, to share his bed with someone. He\u2019s twenty five, and he\u2019s got his friends, his shop, but he knows he also has a scar the size of a dinner plate on his side, a plethora of others on his chest, and enough emotional baggage to cover a whole table in the Hogwarts Great Hall. He\u2019s known for some time that he\u2019s getting by rather than getting on with his life, and he\u2019s mostly okay with that; after living through the war, he\u2019ll take dull, and a bit lonely with the occasional fainting spell, any day. But he can\u2019t help but think the Healers are onto something, that more than anything the physical contact with another person, another wolf, might be nice. \nAs Draco finally falls asleep, he knows that a not insignificant part of him is hoping that he and the Companion will be compatible.\n*\nOf course it\u2019s Potter.\nDraco stands out the front of the cafe for a full thirteen minutes, reeling from the sight of that messy dark hair, the familiar glasses, as Harry sits in the window seat of The Picnic Table, the East London cafe Draco was told to arrive at. Harry\u2019s wearing jeans, a grey t-shirt, his hair a little on the too long side and as wild as ever, and Draco wipes a hand over his mouth, realises his fingers are shaking and stuffs them into his pocket. He takes a step forwards, then immediately takes another step backwards, his stomach churning with something like anger, like humiliation, like queasy surprise. The rut hormones are in there too, making him jittery, flighty, tense. He wants to Disapparate away right now. \nOf course it\u2019s fucking Potter!\nHe shakes his head angrily, the wilting summer sun making him just a little too warm in his Muggle cotton shirt, his thin trousers. More than angry, than surprised, he\u2019s furious with himself for letting his hopes rise, for imagining something might happen here. It\u2019s Potter, and for whatever reason he\u2019s agreed to do this. Is he claiming his life debt, in some fucked up way? Is this revenge, seeing Draco at his lowest, a cowering dog that can\u2019t knot, can\u2019t stay on its feet, hasn\u2019t learnt its new tricks? \n\nPotter\u2019s a werewolf too, idiot. \n\nDraco stops, bringing himself out of his anger. It\u2019s true, as his subconscious knows; Harry was bitten not long after Draco was. Maybe six months, a year? He brought down Greyback himself, while still only in Auror training, still in the ugly, grey robes of the not-yet-graduated. Draco remembers that day, how he\u2019d crowed inside seeing Fenrir\u2019s face as he was carted off to prison, and then how he\u2019d visited his mother. She wasn\u2019t there, only Lucius, and when Draco had burst into surprised, horrible, relieved tears on the Manor doorstep, his father had offered him a rare hug, held him tight and smoothed a broad hand over his head like he used to when he was little. \nDraco hasn\u2019t thought about Harry since that day. Not really. Not in any tangible way, anything worth remembering, he tells himself. \nDraco knows that if Harry is working \u2015 or did work, at least \u2015 as a Heat Companion, then he\u2019s coping with what he is better than Draco. He suddenly remembers Olivia the Mind Healer\u2019s insistence that Harry would want to help him, would take his case on even though he doesn\u2019t do this work anymore. Draco sneers, a further curl of annoyance inside him. \nFucking Saint Potter and his charity cases. Draco\u2019s damned if he\u2019ll be one. He finally makes himself walk inside. \n\u201cPotter,\u201d he spits, as he stands before him. \n\u201cHi,\u201d Harry says, looking up, and Draco is momentarily taken aback by the hue of his eyes, the intensity of them. He\u2019s not sure why he expected them to have faded, like his memories of Harry have somewhat, but they\u2019re as bright as ever, as quick. Draco fights the urge to take a step back; he always feels oversensitive before a rut, to bright colours, loud sounds. They don\u2019t upset him but elicit responses that he might otherwise overlook. Harry doesn't seem remotely surprised to see Draco, but of course he isn\u2019t; he\u2019s the one holding all the cards here. Draco\u2019s ire rises again. \n\u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of sick game you\u2019re playing here \u2015\u201d\n\u201cI ordered us both cake,\u201d Harry interrupts, \u201cbut then you were late, and I ate mine.\u201d He looks at the other, also empty plate, and Draco follows his gaze, slightly lost for words. \u201cAnd then I ate yours too,\u201d Harry admits sheepishly, \u201cbecause I wasn\u2019t sure if you were going to actually come in, or just stay out there.\u201d He gestured towards the window, at the street Draco had been standing in, before he stands, pulling out Draco\u2019s chair for him.\nDraco feels a mortified flush creeping over his cheeks at Harry having known he was there. He tries to hang onto his anger from before, but it\u2019s slipping away, and he drops down into the chair, lets a waitress pour them both some water. \n\u201cEverything okay?\u201d she asks. Her name badge tells Draco her name is Larissa, and he nods. \n\u201cYes, my friend is just,\u201d Harry smiles apologetically, at her, and then mostly at Draco, \u201cI surprised him.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d Larissa tilts her head understandingly, in the practiced way of those who work in hospitality and are accustomed to helping smooth over tense social interactions. \u201cCan I get you anything more?\u201d\n\u201cTea,\u201d Draco croaks quickly, determined not to let Harry order for him. \u201cPeppermint, if you have it, please,\u201d he adds, remembering his manners. \n\u201cWe do.\u201d She smiles, and Draco decides he likes her. She leaves them to it, bringing them both a large pot to share, and a biscuit for Draco, on the house she tells him, and Draco suspects Harry has arranged it somehow. He breaks a corner off, dusts the crumbs off his fingers, then fixes Harry with a stare. \n\u201cWhat are you...What is this?\u201d Draco asks, unable to keep the bitterness out of his tone. \nHarry looks at him openly. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly what Olivia told you it would be.\u201d\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t say it would be you!\u201d\n\u201cShould she have?\u201d\n\u201cWha \u2015\u201d Draco laughs, the sound caustic in his throat. \u201cYou knew it was me,\u201d he retorts, and Harry picks up the teapot, then decides to let it steep a little longer. He smiles. \n\u201cYes,\u201d he meets Draco\u2019s eyes, \u201cthat's why I took the job.\u201d\nDraco flexes his fingers in his lap, sits a little straighter. He wants to be sick. \u201cWhy?\u201d he asks, and it comes out in a hoarse whisper. He braces for the answer, for the slap it surely will be, but Harry just looks at him again. \n\u201cBecause I want to help you,\u201d he responds easily, and it doesn\u2019t sound like a lie, but Draco knows that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t. He folds his arms across his chest. \n\u201cWhy?\u201d he repeats, louder and more pointedly, and Harry\u2019s smile turns a little wry. He leans his elbows on the table, doesn\u2019t answer for a moment. \n\u201cI read your interview,\u201d he says after the silence stretches on slightly too long. Draco doesn\u2019t know what Harry is talking about, and he almost snaps as much, until all too quickly the pieces slot together. He feels his lip curl. \n\u201cAh. My interview,\u201d he says dryly. \nHarry\u2019s eyes are serious as he nods. \n\u201cDone your research on me, have you?\u201d Draco looks away, pouring himself some tea to have something to do with his slightly shaking hands; he manages to only spill a little on the table. \u201cI imagine it\u2019s not too hard to dig that old rag up,\u201d he mumbles, feeling oddly exposed. \n\u201cI\u2019ve had it since it came out,\u201d Harry replies. \n\u201cHad?\u201d Draco frowns, setting his teacup in front of him. \n\u201cYes,\u201d Harry smiles. \u201cI\u2019ve had a copy since it came out,\u201d he reiterates, pushing his hair back behind one ear. HIs fingers are long, his arms slightly tanned, and Draco doesn't know what to say. \n\u201cWhen it came out...\u201d he says, too surprised to remember he\u2019s angry. \u201cThat was years ago.\u201d\n\u201cSeven years, yeah. Or seven and a half, I guess,\u201d Harry sighs, heavily, and his breath lifts a curl of hair which has fallen back across his forehead. Harry sweeps it back. \u201cIt helped me.\u201d \nDraco opens his mouth, eyes wide and mind whirring at a thousand beats a second. \n\u201cHo \u2015\u201d Draco rubs his jaw, then his cheek. \u201cHow?\u201d he finally manages to ask, softer and more sincerely that he\u2019d intended. \n\u201cIt helped me tell people,\u201d Harry says again, in that easy and open and utterly genuine manner. Draco feels floored by it. \n\u201cNo, but you weren\u2019t,\u201d Draco clears his throat. \u201cYou weren\u2019t bitten at the time. Not until a year or so after I did that stupid interview. You...Greyback, you were in training, and you got the fucker, and that\u2019s when you were bitten, turned.\u201d Draco frowns, but Harry just twists his mouth, mouthing the word nope. \n\u201cNo,\u201d Harry says out loud, sitting back, \u201cit wasn\u2019t stupid, what you did. And no,\u201d Harry nods again, \u201cI just didn\u2019t tell anyone \u2018til after Greyback. After I left the training program. After you.\u201d \nDraco\u2019s mind is reeling. He feels almost dizzy with the knowledged that Harry was bitten around the same time he was, and then didn\u2019t tell anyone for nearly a year. \u201cYou hid it? Why?\u201d he asks before he can stop himself. \nHarry shrugs, the movement fluid while his face is tense. \n\u201cHonestly? Shame.\u201d Harry sighs. \u201cOne of the bravest men I ever knew was a werewolf, and I looked up to him. I thought he was so strong, invincible, indestructible. Even when he died, I thought of him like that. But there were times, when I,\u201d he bites his lower lip, \u201cI judged him, and harshly. I never told him what I thought of him, never took the time to \u2015\u201d He stops, inhaling and puffing out one cheek. \u201cAnyway, that\u2019s another story.\u201d He looks back at Draco, his eyes a little bright. Draco realises he\u2019s holding his breath, the whistle and hum of the cafe seeming to fade out behind them. \n\u201cAnd then I got bitten, and I just\u2026\u201d Harry raises his brows. \u201cI hated myself. Instantly. I hated transforming, I hated the potions, I hated the stigma. I hated the person who had done this, that they hadn\u2019t looked after themselves better, hadn\u2019t sought help to manage the moon.\u201d He rests his cheek in his hand. \u201cI thought, I\u2019d been through so much already, and now there was bloody this to deal with. What kind of system of fairness is that?\u201d He looks at Draco wryly, and Draco swallows, wonders if he should answer. He doesn\u2019t think he can. He inclines his head, motioning for Harry to go on. \n\u201cThen I got over the self pity,\u201d Harry says, \u201cwhich was surprisingly not as bad as what came next. Which was the self-loathing. And the shame,\u201d he makes the word sounds so heavy. \u201cI felt like such a fucking hypocrite. Nearly his whole life, and Remus had been fighting this, fighting off this Dark Magic, and I never really appreciated it. I even thought he was a coward for running from Tonks, from bringing a child into this, and then,\u201d Harry swallows, thickly, \u201cthen it happens to me and I wanna throw myself off the first building I see. The empathy was bad enough, but god, I just, hated myself for not being more okay with it, for being so angry, and then I had my first heat and that was like the icing on the already rotten cake, so I just\u2026.kept it hidden. People close to me knew, but only a couple of Healers, and I planned to just keep it that way. Stay in the Aurors, pretend it never happened, tell no one.\u201d He shrugs, and his smile is brighter than Draco thinks it should be, at contrast with this slightly watery eyes. He doesn't say anything for a moment, only presses his finger onto the end of his spoon, raises it slightly. \n\u201cShame\u2019s gross, huh?\u201d Harry says, as though this is something Draco might understand, and Draco still doesn\u2019t know how to answer. His heart is thumping, his chest tight. \nHe swallows, setting his cooling tea down. \u201cAnd then?\u201d he asks hoarsely. \n\u201cWell.\u201d Harry smiles, and his teeth are white and straight, his eyes fierce. \u201cThen some blond prat I went to school with did an interview with the Prophet, holding his own against a reporter who clearly had a bias against him, and who had even more reason than me to hide what he was now.\u201d Draco\u2019s stomach lurches as Harry keeps talking quietly. \u201cAnd I pulled my head out my arse, and started telling people too.\u201d His smile quirks up to one side. \u201cWell, took me a few more months, but I did it.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Draco closes his eyes. \u201cBecause of me?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Draco opens his eyes to see Harry watching him, almost kindly. \u201cIt was brave of you. Inspiring.\u201d\nAt that, Draco manages a laugh. \u201cI find it very unlikely that I inspired you,\u201d he croaks around the lump of emotion in his chest. Fuck, he hates the week before a rut. Everything seems to hit him ten times as hard. \n\u201cWeirder things have happened, Draco.\u201d \nDraco laughs again, inclines his head in concession. Harry\u2019s got a point there. \u201cWhy are you telling me all of this?\u201d\nHarry makes a face, almost embarrassed. \u201cI\u2019m...annoyingly honest these days,\u201d he says, grinning self deprecatingly. \u201cEspecially, um. In these kinds of scenarios. It\u2019s good to be direct, forthright.\u201d \nDraco raises his brows at the reminder of what they\u2019re here for, at the motive behind Harry\u2019s candor. He wants it to rankle him, but it doesn't. \n\u201cI hated doing that interview,\u201d he abruptly admits. \u201cI wanted to leave, as soon as it started.\u201d He isn\u2019t sure why he feels compelled to say this, whether it\u2019s to shatter any idea Harry might have that he is brave, or worthy of any stock Harry has put in his character, or if he just feels like he owes Harry some kind of equally bone-deep honesty. \n\u201cBut you did it anyway.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cAnd do you regret it?\u201d\nDraco furrows his brow. \u201cNo. Not at all.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s brave.\u201d Harry takes a sip of tea, makes a face when he finds it only lukewarm, and Draco almost smiles. \u201cStaying and doing it even when you want to bail.\u201d Harry raises his teacup. \u201cThat's the only kind of bravery I know, anyway.\u201d \n\u201cMaybe I just couldn't find the exit?\u201d Draco raises an eyebrow, trying to break the spell, the tension between them. It\u2019s not bad, but he wants to snap it anyway. \u201cOr a window to jump out of?\u201d Harry laughs. \n\u201cStill brave. I won\u2019t be talked out of it,\u201d he says definitely. \u201cYou didn\u2019t jump out a window, I didn\u2019t jump off a building, and now here we are.\u201d \nDraco crosses one leg over the other. \u201cAnd tell me, where are we exactly?\u201d\nHarry laughs again. He does it a lot, Draco realises. \n\u201cIn a Muggle cafe, discussing sex.\u201d \n\u201cWe\u2019re not discussing sex, Potter.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re about to.\u201d\nDraco quirks his lip, as Harry raises his brows at him. \u201cDown to business, then, is it?\u201d His tone is dry, but Harry doesn't seem fazed. \n\u201cI imagine you have questions,\u201d he asks, offering the floor up to Draco. Draco sits a little straighter, rests his hands on his knee. \n\u201cHow is it you came to be a prostitute?\u201d he asks bluntly. He doesn't mean it to be cruel, but he\u2019s dying to know. And okay, a little bit of him does mean to be cruel, to pull Harry\u2019s metaphorical pigtails. Some habits are hard to break. \nHarry only laughs, giving him a sharp but fond look. \u201cI\u2019m not a prostitute.\u201d\n\u201cNo?\u201d Draco looks down and then back at Harry\u2019s eyes. \u201cRetired prostitute?\u201d\nHarry\u2019s laugh is louder this time. \u201cNo. Retired freelance sex and intimacy therapist,\u201d he corrects. Draco blinks. \n\u201cThat\u2019s quite a job title, Potter.\u201d\n\u201cTax time was a nightmare,\u201d Harry agrees, and Draco huffs in amusement. He can\u2019t tell if Harry\u2019s joking or not, can\u2019t remember if he used to be this funny, or quick-witted, back at school. He certainly always gave Draco a run for his money. Harry\u2019s sitting back in his chair, his t-shirt pulled tight over his chest and a smile on his lips, and Draco feels something stir inside him. Attraction. He looks away, but he knows Harry\u2019s seen it, maybe even scented it. Omegas are more attuned to that than Alphas, more able to pick up scents. The closer it comes to the rut, the more Draco will be able to scent too, but for now, he can only faintly pick up Harry, his cologne, and something else underneath it. Something heavier and lighter at the same time, stronger and yet still tantalisingly far away. \nThe attraction stirs again inside him, and Draco tightens his fingers on his knee. \n\u201cHow do you know Olivia?\u201d he asks. \n\u201cAh.\u201d Harry stretches, and Draco can\u2019t stop himself from watching the movement. He feels hot, hotter than the weather would explain. \u201cThat\u2019s a long story really. We met...a while ago. Before I was working.\u201d\n\u201cShe was your Mind Healer,\u201d Draco states, thinking quick. Harry wrinkles his nose. \n\u201cSort of, yeah.\u201d\n\u201cAnd she got you into this work?\u201d Draco can\u2019t stop the distaste from entering his voice.\n\u201cNo, no.\u201d Harry shakes his head, and then his hair out of his eyes. \u201cThose two things were not connected. I\u2019d stopped seeing her, when I started Companioning. It was about a year later, we bumped into each other and she asked how I was going with everything, and from there I told her. I kind of thought she\u2019d think it was weird, but she said it was great for me. I mean. What she actually said was that it showed I was both accepting what I was now, and helping other people in a way that soothed my persistent saviour complex in a productive manner.\u201d Harry smiles wryly, eyes crinkling at Draco\u2019s expression. \u201cAnd then I reminded her she should stop bloody diagnosing me, considering we were both off the clock and in a pub.\u201d\n\u201cI like Olivia,\u201d Draco says quietly, and Harry laughs sharply. \n\u201cOf course you do.\u201d He rubs a hand over his chin. \u201cAnyway, from there she started referring people to me. Well, she used to, when I was working properly, before I stopped.\u201d He leans forwards, rests his elbows back on the table as he looks at Draco evenly. \u201cAnd stop making that face. Which, yes, you are making,\u201d Harry laughs. Draco opens his mouth, taken aback by Harry\u2019s directness but he doesn't look angry. \u201cIt\u2019s a legitimate job,\u201d Harry continues, \u201cbeing a Heat Companion. You need to be certified, accredited, before any Healer or Mind Healer will refer clients to you.\u201d\n\u201cBut you...You don\u2019t do this, this Companion thing anymore?\u201d Draco asks quietly, slightly chagrined. \n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\nHarry takes a moment to think. \u201cIt can be...tiring. Emotionally, mentally. Heats are only four times a year, but there\u2019s a lot more that we do. Building rapport with clients, working through emotional problems, physical ones too. I took a step back, just briefly, and then I,\u201d Harry shrugged, \u201cfound it hard to step back in.\u201d\n\u201cAnd during heats?\u201d\nOh,\u201d Harry\u2019s smile is lopsided. \u201cI just do what everyone else does. Lock the door, block my Floo, hide my phone and wank myself raw.\u201d\n\u201cBlock your Floo?\u201d Draco asks as a flush blooms on his cheeks. \u201cWhy?\u201d\nHarry shakes his head slightly. \u201cUm, embarrassing really. So I don\u2019t contact anyone, ask them to. You know. I can be a bit, um, insistent, and, well\u2026.\u201d Harry\u2019s mouth turns down. Draco\u2019s eyes widen and Harry waves his hand again, a little bit red in the face himself. \u201cThat\u2019s not relevant right now though, that\u2019s a,\u201d he clears his throat, \u201ca conversation we will have if you decide to do this. If you want me.\u201d\nDraco swallows, heat rushing through him at Harry\u2019s words. \u201cSo why have you agreed,\u201d he weighs his words, \u201cto discuss taking on this job?\u201d\n\u201cYou, you mean?\u201d Harry\u2019s look is searching, warm. \u201cWhy have I agreed to take on you?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Draco confirms quietly. Harry leans even closer. \n\u201cBecause I want to help you. And I can,\u201d he says sincerely, emphatically. He holds a hand up before Draco can protest. \u201cLiv \u2015 Olivia,\u201d Harry qualifies at Draco\u2019s frown, \u201cshe referred this specifically to me, because she knew I would want to take this, and that I\u2019d be good at it.\u201d\n\u201cIs this a regular day\u2019s work for you, then?\u201d Draco can\u2019t stop the bitter snap that creeps into the tone of his voice. \u201cSpecialising in impotence, broken Alphas who can\u2019t knot?\u201d \nHe winces, immediately regretting what he\u2019s said. Sure, both of them know that's what this is, but he hadn\u2019t wanted to fucking lay it all out there, just like that. He\u2019s glad, at least, that they\u2019re by the far window, away from any other patrons. The staff seem uninterested in them, in Draco\u2019s somersaulting emotions. \nHarry, on the other hand, is staring at him intently. His brow furrows slightly. \n\u201cHow do you want me to answer that?\u201d he asks quietly, and Draco feels worse for a moment, before he gives up.\n\u201cHonestly,\u201d he forces himself to say, and Harry nods, a deep bow of his head. \n\u201cOkay.\u201d Harry takes a deep breath. \u201cYes, this is the kind of stuff I do, or did, so I guess it was a regular day\u2019s work as you said.\u201d Draco feels himself withdrawing, and Harry\u2019s expression falls slightly. He continues talking anyway. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t specialise in impotence, or knotting issues. I don\u2019t specialise in anything, except,\u201d he tilts his head, and his hair falls over his glasses before he swats it away, \u201cintimacy. Which is the actual issue here.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s your professional opinion, is it.\u201d Draco ties to make professional sound dirty, but he\u2019s too on edge, his hackles raised. \n\u201cYes. It\u2019s mine, and Olivia\u2019s.\u201d Harry\u2019s smile is kind, but there\u2019s something in his eyes which is tentative. \u201cTouch is important, Draco, and you\u2019ve not let yourself have it for a long, long time, not really.\u201d\n\u201cAnd one night with you will fix that, will it?\u201d There\u2019s a plaintive note in his voice under the barb. \u201cIs that all it usually takes for your clients, one rut and they\u2019re back on the streets, packing steel between their legs?\u201d\nHarry\u2019s eyes soften as he watches Draco. He worries his lower lip before he replies. \u201cI don\u2019t think you actually want to talk about past clients, Draco,\u201d is all he says, and Draco runs his hand over his mouth. He nods, embarrassed at being called out, at being read so easily. He doubts it was hard at all. \n\u201cWell,\u201d Harry looks at the teapot in between them, \u201cI think now is as good a place as any to leave it.\u201d \nDraco looks up sharply, Harry\u2019s decision unexpected. \u201cAlready?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Harry tucks away that errant curl of hair once more. \u201cFrom here, it\u2019s up to you. If you want to go any further than this,\u201d he clarifies. \u201cYou can owl me, or Olivia with your decision with a simple yes or no. We have time but I would say no longer than two days. We\u2019ll need to meet again before the turn of the season hits. To discuss specifics.\u201d\n\u201cMoney, you mean?\u201d \nHarry shrugs noncommittally. \u201cSure, money, generating compatibility, everything. Sex, of course. What can happen, what can\u2019t.\u201d Harry smiles. \u201cThe contract.\u201d\n\u201cMerlin,\u201d Draco breathes, and Harry holds up a hand. \n\u201cThat\u2019s to worry about next time, if you want to.\u201d\nThey lapse into silence, as Harry seems to get ready to leave, waiting for acknowledgement from Draco first. Draco himself feels odd, panicked, the morning having slipped away so quickly, before he\u2019d even noticed it. He should let Harry leave, should make a decision later, but he thinks he already knows what he wants. He knew it on some level as soon as he walked in, sat down, as soon as Harry opened his mouth. Saying it, however, is a different matter. \n\u201cI\u2019d like,\u201d Draco straightens his posture, uncomfortable but determined, \u201cto engage your services.\u201d \nIt\u2019s overly formal, stiff and awkward, and he sounds like he\u2019s asking Harry to come and clean his Floo, but Harry doesn\u2019t look put out, or like he\u2019ll laugh. \n\u201cReally?\u201d Harry smiles, once, a brief and brilliant flash of white teeth. \u201cRight, um, that\u2019s.\u201d He grins again, vibrant. \u201cGreat. So, I\u2019ll have Olivia draft up the contract, she always handled that for me before. Then she\u2019ll send it to you, and then we should meet again asap to go over it. Before um. Before the big night,\u201d he finishes playfully, lips quirking. It\u2019s unexpected, and Draco smiles before he realises it.\n\u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, don\u2019t call it that.\u201d \nHarry laughs once, almost silently. \u201cHow about, before I get you out of your rut?\u201d\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s fucking dreadful, Potter,\u201d Draco laughs softly too, despite himself. \u201cI changed my mind already.\u201d \n\u201cNah,\u201d Harry stands, pats his pockets down to make sure he has everything. \u201cYou won\u2019t change your mind.\u201d He looks almost hopeful, happy, and Draco doesn\u2019t know what to make of that. \u201cRight, well. See you soon.\u201d\nDraco inclines his head in a polite nod, even though his insides are doing a jig. Harry smiles one last time, causing another flash of heat in Draco\u2019s belly, his chest, before he leaves. \nSeven minutes and one cup of cold tea later, Draco leaves too.\n*\nThe contract arrives faster than Draco expects.\nIt\u2019s early, the day after their first meeting on Draco\u2019s morning off. He doesn't like leaving Pansy alone in the shop, but he has to concede she\u2019s easily as organised as he is, in her own scattered way, and she\u2019s better at handling the Muggle inventory these days. Most of their clientele are Muggle these days, their bookshop straddling both worlds \u2015 literally, as it has one entrance of Diagon Alley, and another on high street. It\u2019s a complicated Charm, but one for which they fought for approval, and it\u2019s the only way they can survive as a business. Not enough wizards would buy from them to keep them afloat, and not enough Muggles buy books full stop, but between them both Flowers and Dragons is keeping afloat.\nThe parchment is stark white, the kind St Mungos uses, and he doesn't recognise the handwriting on it, until he suddenly does \u2015 the Self-Inking Quill, from Olivia\u2019s office. The tawny owl taps at the window of his bedroom, rousing him, and he curses it, grumbles as he get up to let it in. With a squawk and a flurry of feathers the bird flaps past him, settles on his bedside table and watches him with large, expectant eyes. \n\u201cGood morning,\u201d Draco says grumpily, still muddled with sleep. He\u2019s shirtless, wearing only thin pyjama bottoms. The weather is still more summer than autumn, and it\u2019s not cold. He pads downstairs, the bird hopping along the bannister next to him as it waits for a treat and Draco smiles. He\u2019s never seen an owl do that before, he thinks, as he watches it hop after him, claws scratching without leaving marks against the polished wood, wings extended. The letter on its ankle rustles against the wood. \n\u201cYou\u2019re very odd,\u201d he says to it, as he fetches the owl treats from the kitchen drawer, hands it one, and then two. It hoots softly, sticking its leg out again, and Draco sighs, then unwraps it with a lurching stomach. The owl watches him with avian curiosity, turning its head this way and that the way only an owl can, and Draco realises it will be waiting until he replies. He stops, unaccountably nervous about this whole thing, before he sighs, then makes himself a strong pot of first flush Darjeeling tea. Once it\u2019s steeped and ready, he sits at the kitchen counter stool, puts on the glasses he pretends he doesn't need and begins to properly read. \nIt\u2019s more formal than he expected it to be. \nEverything is drawn up in the vein of a business contract, the expectations and obligations of both parties outlined clearly, and Draco takes a moment to be surprised by that before he realises it makes sense; this is a business contract. His lips twists slightly, something stirring inside him, but he pushes it away. It\u2019s good that this is formal, controlled. If there\u2019s one thing Draco can respect, it\u2019s that. \nHe reads the three pages twice, as well as the letter form Olivia\u2019s office explaining what to do. Initial each page, indicating he understands the terms, except for two sections he should leave blank: section C.3, indicating that all \u2018events of the heat will be pre-discussed and agreed to between client \u2015 D. L. M \u2015 and Heat Companion \u2015 H.J.P \u2015 in accordance with their mutual needs, preferences, and desires, and with the understanding that consent can be withdrawn by either party at any time\u2019, and section C.4 \u2015 something titled the Voluntarily Involuntary Full Disclosure Agreement. \nDraco makes a face at that, the contradiction of it baffling him. He isn't sure which one sounds more ominous, the fact that he\u2019s doing to have to negotiate with Harry what he wants in bed, and then be told what he needs, presumably, or the fact that there\u2019s an entirely blank section dedicated to some kind of disclosure he will have to make. He\u2019s beginning to feel not only second, but also third and fourth, thoughts, when he notices that there is a small note stuck to the back of the page, in a different handwriting. It\u2019s messy, untidy, and somehow incredibly familiar. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t panic about this bit, it\u2019s not as bad as it sounds. I\u2019ll explain it all properly, without the legalese, when we meet up. Does tomorrow at ten sound good? I\u2019m technically an unemployed layabout, so can do whenever. Let me know. \n\n\nH.P.\u201d\n\nDraco sets the small note down on top of the contract, smooths a hand over it. The owl trips a little closer, still walking with that strange hop-gait it has, and Draco scratches it behind the ear, deepens the caress as it tilts its head happily. \n\u201cAre you his owl?\u201d he asks softly and the owl hoots again. \nDraco hums, not sure why he finds that idea so comforting \u2015 why Harry\u2019s note has settled his nerves. He didn\u2019t write the contract, but he must have checked it over, looked through Draco\u2019s copy and sent it from his house, with his own strange and endearing messenger. He must have known that it would be baffling, confusing, a jumble of unfamiliar terminology, and perhaps he did this for all the clients he met with. Draco\u2019s stomach twists a little at that thought, and he takes another sip of his tea. It doesn't matter whether Harry has done this for others, he tells himself. Draco likes that he did it for him, and he lets himself have that, the little spell of warmth in his chest at the sight of Harry\u2019s friendly, messy scrawl. \nHe writes back \u2015 \u201cYes. You choose where.\u201d \u2015 and sends the note with the owl. \nHe spends the rest of the morning in his garden, reading, or trying to at least, but he\u2019s restless, keyed up. He feels anxious about meeting Harry tomorrow, but it\u2019s an excited kind of anxiety, one he\u2019s felt before. The night before dates, before birthdays, before Christmas morning arrives. It\u2019s confusing, and worrying, and he can\u2019t concentrate on the words on the page before him as he sits partly in the shade, and partly letting the sun warm his shoulders, kiss them with its sting. The Full Disclosure Agreement is bothering him, because he suspects that will terminate the contract. There\u2019s bad blood between them, between himself and Harry, some of it literal too, he thinks as he recalls the way the water turned red around him as Sectumsempra sliced open his chest. He wants to be angry about that, but he never was, not even after it happened; there was too much else to be terrified for, and he strangely found himself believing Snape when he told him he didn\u2019t think Harry knew what the spell did. Harry\u2019s face, the brief glimpse of it Draco had seen, didn\u2019t look like the face of someone who had wanted to hurt him like that. He looked horrified. \nHe looked different when he\u2019d come back for Draco, pulled him out of the flames. He looked like that had been done on purpose. \nDraco snaps his book shut, drops it onto the grass by his feet and then pulls them up onto his wicker chair. He scrubs a hand through his hair. And what about what Draco had tried to do, with Dumbledore, by helping the Death Eaters get into the school? Harry won\u2019t have forgotten his part in that, he thinks, as a lot of people won\u2019t have. He won\u2019t have forgiven that, Draco thinks, or Draco for the people he lost. Draco hasn\u2019t forgiven himself, not entirely, for the people he lost during that, too. They can't pick and choose what parts of their history to remember, can\u2019t gloss over it, and \u2015 \n\nAnd Harry agreed to this.\n\nDraco flexes his toes against the unyielding frame of the chair. He rests his chin on his knee, forces himself to calm down. More than that, Draco tells himself, Harry wants to do it, and he was perfectly candid about why. Perhaps, in the end, Harry\u2019s not as stuck in the past as Draco thinks he should be, or is himself. \nDraco sighs, cracking his stiff neck and standing up and out of the slightly too hot sun. Either way, that\u2019s enough internal bloody self-crucifixion for one day, he decides with determination, heading for the shower. He\u2019s not sure if it\u2019s the surprise of finding out the Companion is Harry, or if this is how it feels this close to a rut, but he feels emotional, raw, introspective and slightly volatile. He\u2019s usually taking suppressants by now, upping the dosage each day, and supplementing them with his own cocktail of other potions. It reminds him of the lead up to a transformation, but it\u2019s not quite the same. He\u2019s not angry, sore, but he does feel disorientated, hyper aware of those around him. Everything is starting to smell more vibrant; the orange he had for breakfast, as he rolled the firm fruit against his cheek, made his tongue almost tingle with its zest, and the scent of the jasmine in the garden borders now on overwhelming. \nHis body feels more sensitive too, as the water from the shower sluices over his skin, massages over his scalp. It\u2019s nice, warm, and he feels his cock thickening between his legs, hanging hard and heavy as he threads his fingers through his hair, pressing them just on this side of too hard as he lathers the shampoo. He runs one hand down his chest, avoiding the edge of the bite scar as he skates his fingers over his ribs, his belly, to his erection. It thickens further under his touch, and he braces one hand against the wall of the shower, moves his fist in a slow, firm pace. He keeps his mind a careful blank. \nIt takes only moments to bring himself off, coming in thick spurts over his fist as he rests his forehead on a cold section of tile. He sighs, licking his lips as the last of his orgasm ebbs away, and he feels better for it. There\u2019s a tension that leaves him, as he washes himself off, dries himself with quick sweeps of his towel. \nHe\u2019s late for work, in the end, stepping through the door as Pansy taps her watch pointedly, pretending to glower. He smiles back, handing her a danish and a peach he picked up on the way, its flesh soft and perfectly ripe, as an apology. He smiles even wider when she beams at him \u2015 he knows they\u2019re her favourite \u2015 and splits the fruit easily with a tap of her wand, offering him half. The juice slips over his thumb, down his wrist, and he licks at it, curls his tongue around the heel of his hand, then back up to the peach. \nThe flavour bursts on his tongue as he bites into it.\n*\n*\nHarry chooses a different cafe for the second meeting. It\u2019s smaller, and no less quaint than the first, but when he arrives, Draco sees Harry is standing outside, rather than waiting for him with a table.\nHe\u2019s also holding two takeaway cups. \n\u201cWorried I wouldn't come in again?\u201d Draco makes himself say, and Harry only smiles, his eyes unreadable behind his dark, prescription sunglasses. He\u2019s wearing jeans, trainers, and a thin black jacket over the top, the sleeves rolled up to reveal his forearms. It\u2019s not as hot as the day before, a little bit of a cool breeze, and Draco wore a t-shirt himself. The faded Mark is still visible there, and he sees Harry\u2019s eyes flick to it, but if Draco\u2019d been expecting Harry to be shocked, he isn't. His smile doesn't leave his face once. \n\u201cNah,\u201d Harry replies casually, offering Draco one of the takeaway cups in his hands. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice enough day, so I thought we could walk and talk. And sign,\u201d he pulls the side of his shirt away to reveal his own copy of the contract tucked into his jeans. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly the kind of conversation we want people to overhear,\u201d he adds conspiratorially. \n\u201cAh.\u201d Draco takes the offered cup, nodding in understanding. \u201cIs that why you keep choosing Muggle locations?\u201d \n\u201cNo,\u201d Harry replies, starting to walk towards a park at the end of the street. \u201cThat\u2019s because I don\u2019t want to be seen.\u201d\n\u201cWith me?\u201d Draco snaps, and Harry stops, looks at him.\n\u201cNo, no, I mean seen at all.\u201d He lifts his sunglasses, searching Draco\u2019s face. Draco can see his eyes, and without the usual frames, they seem even brighter than they were the other day. It\u2019s such an unusual green, the colour that Harry has inherited, such a vibrant hue that Draco\u2019s never seen on anyone else before. Right now, those eyes are staring at him intently. \n\u201cSeriously, I just.\u201d Harry licks his lips. \u201cPeople recognise me, in Diagon, or Hogsmeade. But we can go there, if you prefer, instead of \u2015\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s. No.\u201d Draco bites his lip, annoyed with himself. It doesn\u2019t look like Harry\u2019s lying, but either way, Draco didn\u2019t want to reveal that what Harry might be thinking bothered him. He looks away and then back again. \u201cPeople recognise me there, too.\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d It\u2019s another moment before Harry lowers his glasses, the tinted black covering up the green. \u201cShall we, then?\u201d he says, and Draco nods as they begin to walk towards the park once more. \nThey walk half of the way in silence, each sipping on the tea Harry procured them. It\u2019s peppermint again and Draco is quietly pleased that Harry remembered what he took last time. He\u2019s also far too polite to mention it\u2019s not his favourite; he doesn't want to make Harry uncomfortable, or feel foolish. That\u2019s certainly a new feeling, he realises with a wry smile. He puts it down to the phase of the season, and the general bizarreness of this whole situation, but he knows that\u2019s not really the truth. \nAnother few steps, and Draco says, \u201cI thought you couldn\u2019t see without them.\u201d He gestures towards Harry\u2019s eyes, and Harry\u2019s lips quirk as he steps aside to let a woman with a pram pass him. \n\u201cOh, I can see your face fine.\u201d Harry gestures with his cup. \u201cThat sign over there though? Couldn\u2019t read that to save my life.\u201d\nDraco makes a contemplative sound. \u201cLet\u2019s hope your life never depends on finding your way to Bennetts Street, then.\u201d Harry laughs, softly, and Draco likes it. Bloody hell, has the world gone mad? \u201cSo where are we going?\u201d Draco adds, and Harry points at the park. \n\u201cIt\u2019s nice in there. Little bit of a lake, not that many people this time of day. Thought we could go over any questions you had, get to the finer points of the contract.\u201d They wait at the lights for them to flash green, their elbows almost touching and the sun causing Draco to lift his hand and shield his eyes a little. The lights change, beeping gently but entirely too loud, and Draco hurries across the street, Harry by his side and thoughts of contracts \u2015 negotiations \u2015 swimming in his stomach along with the slightly bitter mint tea. \n\u201cOver there.\u201d Harry leads them away from the crowd, and into the park. It\u2019s larger than Draco expected, small pockets of people sitting around and he follows Harry onto a pebbled pathway, flanked by some trees. There\u2019s less people, and Draco breathes a sigh of relief he hadn\u2019t known he\u2019d needed as he steps into the shade, the quiet. \n\u201cSame,\u201d Harry says, quietly, and Draco frowns. \u201cCan\u2019t handle crowds this close to the turn,\u201d Harry elaborates, and Draco almost wants to protest that that\u2019s not what this is, that he just needed a bit of quiet, but Harry might be onto something. He does immediately feel calmer once he\u2019s away from the sensory onslaught of the busy street and the chattering clatter of the city-goers. \n\u201cThis is all slightly new for me,\u201d he confesses, and Harry doesn\u2019t look surprised. \u201cMind you, I\u2019m not a fan of busy streets at the best of times, so perhaps it isn\u2019t such a novel experience.\u201d\nHarry laughs. \u201cThere\u2019s a gazebo up ahead. Little bit of a botanical park. We can talk there, assuming it\u2019s not occupied.\u201d He crosses his middle finger over his index in a hopeful gesture, and Draco suddenly wishes he could see his eyes. They continue walking in mostly companionable silence, Draco\u2019s brogues and Harry\u2019s trainers crunching in tandem against the small stones of the path. \n\u201cIs this the kind of thing we should be discussing in public?\u201d Draco asks, after another moment of internally debating whether he should or not. \u201cThe contract,\u201d he clarifies needlessly. Harry makes a pensieve sound. \n\u201cSome of it, no. And therefore we won\u2019t.\u201d He tips his sunglasses onto his head, pulls them off and then replaces them with his regular lenses. Draco finds himself, again, comforted by the return of Harry\u2019s visible eyes, his easily readable expressions, to the conversation. \u201cI think we should go to my house, or yours, for those sections, if that\u2019s okay with you. But some of it is much better done somewhere...less private.\u201d Draco furrows his brow in confusion but Harry doesn\u2019t elaborate. Instead, he says, \u201cI also just thought this would be a nice place.\u201d Harry smiles, and it\u2019s a little bit tired. \u201cI kind of really needed to get outdoors, get some fresh air, if I\u2019m honest.\u201d \nDraco\u2019s frown deepens as he registers the light purpling smear of lack of sleep under Harry\u2019s eyes, the slightly feverish pink of his cheeks. \u201cYou\u2019re unwell?\u201d he asks, feeling genuine concern build inside him. \n\u201cNo.\u201d Harry shakes his head. \u201cNot exactly. No more so than you are.\u201d He rubs at a spot at the top of his shoulder, grimacing as his fingers move to the base his neck. \n\u201cI don\u2019t feel unwell,\u201d Draco says absently as he watches Harry\u2019s fingers work over the same spot, methodical and soothing. From just under his t-shirt, at the base of Harry\u2019s neck, Draco can see the tip of a faint scar on his collarbone. He wonders if that\u2019s where the bite is, and he looks away, feeling his face heat. It\u2019s strange, the feeling of worry that hits him \u2015 at the idea of Harry not feeling well, at the sight of what might have been the bite that turned him. Draco clenches his fingers into a fist then releases them, fanning them out. He finishes his tea, then discreetly pulls his wand out, shrinks the empty cup and places it in his pocket. \nWhen he turns back, Harry is watching him, his own cup put away too. Draco manages a smile, and he suspects it looks exactly as forced as it feels. \u201cPerhaps I don\u2019t feel all that well, actually.\u201d\nHarry\u2019s returning smile lights up his face, and Draco has to look away again.\n\u201cHere we are,\u201d Harry says, hopping lightly up the small steps to the gazebo. Its metal frame was painted white at one time in its life but it\u2019s mostly peeled away to reveal its bare bones, now. Draco wrinkles his nose as he follows Harry towards the small table in the centre, takes a seat opposite him on the long concrete bench. It\u2019s small, their elbows almost touching as they both rest them on the metal table. \n\u201cNice isn\u2019t it?\u201d Harry says, looking around. \n\u201cNot really, no,\u201d Draco replies honestly, with a smirk, and Harry makes a face at him. \n\u201cIt has charm,\u201d he counters, but his eyes are crinkling with laughter. \n\u201cIt\u2019s falling apart.\u201d\n\u201cCharmingly falling apart.\u201d\n\u201cPotter, I\u2019m sitting on a concrete bench under a pile of impending tetanus,\u201d Draco enunciates, looking up at the rusting roof of the gazebo. \u201cAs far as crumbling charm goes, it\u2019s hardly the Colosseum.\u201d\nHarry laughs, deep and loud. \u201cBeauty can be more than skin deep, Draco.\u201d\n\u201cYes, but it does still need to be there in some form.\u201d Draco looks around at the peeling paint, the exposed metal, the leaves littering the floor. It\u2019s a good cover for trying to hide his smile. Harry laughs again, sitting back and pulling out his copy of the contract. \n\u201cWell, I think this place is charming,\u201d he insists in a low voice, and Draco swallows, feeling a little flushed. It\u2019s warmer with the canopy of leaves above them, he thinks. That must be what it is. \n\u201cWell, first things,\u201d Harry says. \u201cWe\u2019ll start with item one.\u201d He looks at Draco seriously. \u201cThe events of the heat,\u201d he says in a faux ominous voice, his slight smile betraying him. \nDraco pauses as he unshrinks his own copy from his pocket, then raises an eyebrow, his face heating a little. \u201cI would have thought that was the part we might not...have out in public.\u201d Draco carefully unrolls his parchment. \u201cShould we not start with this Full Disclosure business? That seems quite \u2015\u201d \n\u201cNo.\u201d Harry shakes his head. He twists his lips, tucks some of his hair behind his ear before he retrieves a quill from his pocket. \u201cNo, that is item three on today\u2019s agenda, Mr Malfoy.\u201d He\u2019s using that tone again, the pretend-professional, and it\u2019s cutting through the awkwardness quite nicely. \u201cTrust me, you don\u2019t want to do the Disclosure here.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d Draco doesn\u2019t like the sound of that. \u201cAnd that is because\u2026.?\u201d\n\u201cBecause,\u201d Harry scratches his head, drawing out the word. He smiles up at Draco through his fringe, \u201cwe are starting with this one.\u201d He taps the parchment with his finger and Draco snorts, unimpressed. \n\u201cMerlin, that makes no sense.\u201d Draco folds his arms, sitting back slightly and staring at Harry's messy hair. Harry only shrugs, glances back down at the parchment and doesn\u2019t elaborate on the subject, and Draco rolls his eyes. \u201cFine, off we go then, Mr Potter,\u201d he mutters petulantly. \n\u201cAnal sex,\u201d Harry states without looking up, and Draco chokes. \n\u201cPardon?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I assume anal sex is okay with you?\u201d Harry flicks him a glance, fingers splayed on the parchment of his contract. He looks slightly amused. Draco blinks, taking a moment before he replies.\n\u201cYes, that is fine,\u201d he says stiffly. \u201cI\u2019m quite flexible in that regard,\u201d he adds after a moment, somewhat unnecessarily. He swallows, feeling his face colour a little. \u201cNot that that really matters here,\u201d he says, feeling a little bit wrong footed by the questions. Surely it\u2019s a given that will happen? \nHarry, though, just shrugs. \u201cIt all matters.\u201d \n\u201cPotter,\u201d Draco scoffs. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be able to knot if I\u2019m balls deep in the air while you fuck me.\u201d\n\u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d\nHarry\u2019s question takes him aback, and Draco stares, nothing around them but the quiet sounds of the far off park goers, the rustle of the wind in the leaves above their heads. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have assumed so,\u201d Draco says, after a moment. \nHarry shrugs again, eyes never leaving Draco\u2019s. \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised.\u201d He smiles, and it's slightly heated, amused. \u201cBut I think in this instance, given the fact that I\u2019ll be...well.\u201d Harry scratches his ear. \u201cI\u2019ll be quite insistent on certain things,\u201d he says, and it\u2019s almost a mumble. Draco\u2019s heart beats a little faster at the thought of what Harry\u2019s referring to. \u201cAnd that brings us to...Fingering?\u201d Harry says, and Draco blinks, then nods, flushing further. Merlin, but Potter\u2019s questions are certainly\u2026 forward, for want of a better word. \n\u201cOf course. I quite enjoy it,\u201d Draco replies, and then, not one to be outdone by Harry\u2019s directness, he adds, \u201cI'm good with my hands.\u201d \nHarry\u2019s smile widens, showing his teeth. \u201cGreat.\u201d He stares at Draco for a moment. \u201cI'm good with my tongue.\u201d \nFuck. \nDraco laughs, and he knows he\u2019s flushing even pinker. \u201cTouch\u00e9, Potter.\u201d \n\u201cYou can call me Harry.\u201d \n\u201cAll right, Potter.\u201d Draco smiles to show he\u2019s joking. Mostly. Harry looks back down at his contract, at the list there now. Draco sees one has formed on his own. \n\u201cSo I can assume from that exchange, that oral sex is okay,\u201d Harry says, marking something off. \n\u201cYes,\u201d Draco responds, distractedly as he reads the slightly eye-watering list of sexual yeses and nos, his brows lifting. \u201cAny kind of mouth action is fine by me, and I'm not exactly delicate about where mine goes.\u201d When Harry doesn't respond, Draco looks up from his slightly wide eyes reading; the list goes over onto the next page, for Merlin\u2019s sake. \u201cWhat?\u201d Draco asks, as Potter flushes a little, looks away. \n\u201cNothing.\u201d Harry shakes his head, looking slightly sheepish at being caught. \u201cI just didn't expect that.\u201d At Draco\u2019s raised brow he adds, \u201cthat you would do those sorts of things.\u201d\n\u201cI'm a broken Alpha, Potter, not a puritan,\u201d Draco says, slightly bitterly. \u201cI don\u2019t live entirely devoid of touch, despite what you might think.\u201d He knows he\u2019s being petty, and at the look on Harry\u2019s face he immediately regrets it. Harry\u2019s brows knit together. \n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant, when I said that. And you're not broken, Draco \u2015\u201d he starts. \n\u201cMoving on,\u201d Draco interrupts. \u201cHarry,\u201d he adds to soften the rudeness. It oddly looks like it works, as Harry\u2019s scowl eases, his expression softening a little. Draco clears his throat, then turns his contract around, pointing to it with one long finger and drawing Harry\u2019s attention to it. \u201cDo we need to go through all of these?\u201d he asks, a little disbelieving. Harry shakes his head, but it\u2019s not quite a no. \n\u201cIt\u2019s standard procedure, to negotiate everything that happens before we. Y\u2019know.\u201d Harry\u2019s lip quirks up slightly. \u201cBefore the heat.\u201d\nDraco\u2019s mouth drops a little. \u201cAre we going to do all of this?\u201d He looks back down at the list. \n\u201cNo, god.\u201d Harry runs a hand through his hair. \u201cWell, not unless you want to. And if I want to. That's the point of this discussion.\u201d Harry licks his lips. \u201cSo we both know what is okay, what isn't, before anything happens.\u201d \n\u201cSalazar,\u201d Draco mutters. \u201cWell, I mean.\u201d He sits up a little straighter. His eyes skim over the list once more. The words Bondage, light impact play, prostate massage, orgasm delay, blare back up at him, along with a plethora of other things. It's making his mind race. \u201cTo be frank, there\u2019s nothing here I object to, or don't enjoy, but I think\u2026\u201d He stops, worrying his lower lip. Harry moves his fingers, prompting him to go on. \u201cI think I would prefer, just. Something less\u2026\u201d \n\u201cOverwhelming?\u201d Harry offers in an understanding tone. \u201cSame, really. Honestly, that\u2019s what I would have suggested here from the beginning. This is more for\u2026 longer term arrangements.\u201d Draco looks away, something in his chest tightening at that. He doesn't know quite know what to call the emotion. \u201cBut anyway,\u201d Harry goes on, \u201cit's the way the contract is done up, so best we go through it.\u201d\n\u201cIt seems an odd list,\u201d Draco croaks, to cover how strange he's suddenly feeling. Longer term arrangements. He isn't sure if he\u2019s put out Harry has had them before, or that Draco isn't one of them. It\u2019s\u2026 unexpected, he decides, putting a name on an emotion he would usually call \u2018jealousy\u2019.\n\u201cOh?\u201d Harry asks, eyes glittering with something like humour again. \u201cHow so?\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s just an odd assortment.\u201d Draco shrugs. \u201cThere\u2019s no connecting link here.\u201d \n\u201cSure there is.\u201d Harry sticks his tongue in his cheek. \u201cMe.\u201d \n\u201cYou?\u201d \n\u201cYeah. This is all stuff I like.\u201d Harry grins. \u201cWell, chose. There\u2019s a massive list they give us, it\u2019s a bit bonkers really, and we choose what we\u2019re into. And I'm not going to include stuff I don't personally like, am I?\u201d He makes an unimpressed face. \u201cSaviour complex\u2019s not quite that bad yet,\u201d he adds self deprecatingly, and Draco finds himself laughing again, a sharp and surprised sound. \n\u201cNo.\u201d He can\u2019t help but smile at Harry. \u201cI\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t do things you don\u2019t like.\u201d \nHe means it to sound off-hand, to continue the joke, but it comes out more sincere than he means. He considers adding something else, something cutting, but he changes his mind at Harry\u2019s look. At the end of the day, Draco reasons, he does mean that. The idea of Harry doing anything he doesn\u2019t enjoy, with him or otherwise, feel instantly and distinctly repugnant to him. \n\u201cGood,\u201d Harry replies softly. He\u2019s not smiling, but his expression is warm, intense, eyes focussed intently on Draco from under the light shadows his hair casts over his eyes, his cheeks. Draco shifts a little uncomfortably in his seat, reminding himself that Harry chose to accept him as his client. That Harry wants this \u2015 him. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, though.\u201d Harry does smile now. \u201cYou\u2019d hear about it. If anything happened which I didn\u2019t like, that is.\u201d\n\u201cHas it?\u201d Draco asks quickly, something strange churning in his stomach. He clasps his hands in his lap, thumbs pressing tightly together, as Harry frowns then shrugs one shoulder as he realises what Draco is asking. \n\u201cNo. Well, not really,\u201d he qualifies, pushing his hair back away from his face and not quite meeting Draco\u2019s eyes. Draco can feel his knuckles turning white as he tightens his fingers. \n\u201cThat\u2019s not no,\u201d he says, and he\u2019s surprised by his own voice, how low it is. He\u2019s even more surprised by the tight and angry feeling in his chest, by the lurch in his stomach. By the look on his face, Harry is too. \n\u201cOh no, nothing like that,\u201d he says quickly. \u201cIt was nothing I couldn\u2019t handle, or resolve, um, quickly,\u201d he says with a huffed laugh, tucking that errant strand of hair away again. It keeps falling over his glasses, over one eye. Draco\u2019s been watching it. \u201cIt was just one guy, and\u2026.\u201d Harry trails off, staring at Draco in concern. \u201cShould I keep talking about this?\u201d he asks carefully, searching Draco\u2019s expression. Draco shuts his eyes. \n\u201cYes, please,\u201d he grits out, feeling like a complete idiot. He can\u2019t help it, though. He doesn't want to know what this prick did, what Harry\u2019s idea of \u2018resolving things quickly\u2019 is, but at the same time he knows it will drive him mad if he doesn\u2019t find out what it was. The feeling is solid, horrible, in his stomach, his chest, constricting his lungs. It\u2019s anger, but it\u2019s something deeper too, and it\u2019s not on his behalf \u2015 it\u2019s on Harry\u2019s. He can\u2019t remember the last time he felt such a sudden surge of emotion. He suddenly misses the numbness of the suppressants, and at the same time doesn't at all. \nHe hears Harry\u2019s sigh, the parchment rustling slight. \u201cWell, it was during a heat. An Alpha I was helping, only he had trouble with\u2026 boundaries,\u201d Harry says after another a moment. He\u2019s choosing his words carefully, Draco knows, and he\u2019s grateful for it. It infuriates him. It's Harry\u2019s story; why should Draco be the one so affected by it? Still, he keeps his eyes shut, tries to regulate his breathing. \u201cAnd I terminated the arrangement,\u201d Harry says, voice quiet. \n\u201cWhy?\u201d \n\u201cDraco \u2015\u201d \n\u201cWhy?\u201d Draco repeats, eyes still carefully closed. \u201cUnless you don't want to tell me, I would.\u201d He lays one hand over his knee, then does the same with the other. His fingers ache from being clenched. \u201cI would like to know.\u201d \nDraco can hear the wind in the leaves again, can hear the splash of waterfowl in the lake on the other side of the park. Distantly, he knows that\u2019s not normal, that he shouldn't be able to hear that well, to smell the scent of the last of the white wisteria flowers as they drop their petals onto the water below. It's too far away, he knows that, but his body doesn't thinks so. It feels lit up, the way that\u2019s been slowly building for days now. He knows if he concentrated on Harry he could scent him, could count the eyelashes that brush his cheeks as he blinks, could measure the beat of his pulse from here. He wants to, and it terrifies him. He focusses on the flowers instead. \nHe\u2019s counting the petals on the ripples of the lake, when Harry finally answers him. \n\u201cHe tried to bite me.\u201d\nDraco\u2019s eyes fly open. \u201cBite you? Where?\u201d he snaps, but he knows the answer already. \n\u201cI think this is upsetting you,\u201d Harry says, genuine worry tinging in his voice. \n\u201cLit fireplaces upset me, Potter,\u201d Draco snaps, breathing harshly. \u201cDoesn\u2019t mean I avoid them. Draco shuts his eyes, takes a moment to choose his words as his mind reels, and to avoid the stricken look on Harry\u2019s face. \u201cAre you telling me,\u201d another laboured breath, a shaky exhale, \u201cthat someone tried to make a...to bond with you?\u201d Draco finishes on a sibilant hiss. \n\u201c...Yeah,\u201d Harry says after a moment, and Draco\u2019s visions swims. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t successful.\u201d\nHis words are measured, and Draco is again aware than Harry\u2019s not doing it for his own sake. It's Draco that Harry is worried about, and Draco wishes he felt ridiculous about it. Instead he feels murderous, incensed, by what Harry is indicating almost happened. \n\u201cFucking hell,\u201d he croaks, looking away and massaging at his chest, at his diaphragm, where he imagines his lungs meet his ribs. Maybe then he can get the bloody things to work properly. \nDraco knows what a bond is, how it happens; take an Alpha, an Omega, and a possessive bite on the neck, et voila. They\u2019re not unbreakable, but they are \u2015 to Draco\u2019s mind at least \u2015 terrifying. The idea of one being made without the Omega being fully willing, of an Alpha doing it in the frenzy of a rut, has caused him more than his fair share of sleepless nights, before he\u2019d pushed them down into the deepest recesses of his mind. He hadn\u2019t thought about that, hadn\u2019t even factored that as a risk, but now. Now the idea of it is making his blood boil, and freeze at the same time. \n\u201cDoes that happen often?\u201d he manages around the nauseous lump in his throat. \n\u201cNo,\u201d Harry says quickly, looking relieved that Draco is talking again. Whatever insane emotion Draco is feeling about hearing this story, Harry is feeling something different, but he doesn't look unaffected. There\u2019s a blush on the tops of his cheek, his eyes bright as they watch Draco intently. \u201cNot before, and not since.\u201d \nDraco breathes out in a rush. The relief feels like a burst of cool air over him, but it doesn't absolve him entirely of the gnawing feeling in his chest, crawling up his neck. \n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asks, hand still massaging the peak of his ribs. He presses the heel of his palm against it, using the point of contact to centre him. \n\u201cWith him?\u201d Harry shrugs again, distracted as he looks at Draco's jaw. \u201cNothing much, until he thought he\u2019d try it on. Unluckily for him, I wasn't so out of my head I could figure out what he was doing,\u201d Harry\u2019s smile is wry, but there all the same, and Draco realises he missed it. He\u2019s glad he kept his eyes open this time. \u201cTried to spin some crap about being so far gone on me he couldn't help it, but that didn't really ring true.\u201d Harry\u2019s looking at him pointedly now, and Draco presses his hand harder against his chest. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s really how it works, not from the Alphas I\u2019ve spoken too. Once an Omega has made it clear they don\u2019t want that, then unless they change their tune, unless they ask. Well.\u201d Harry still hasn't broken eye contact. \u201cThe urge will be there, for any Alpha, for you, but you won\u2019t act on it. Not unless you choose to.\u201d\nHe raises his brows, that curl of hair hanging over one, and Draco knows Harry is answering a question right now \u2015 one that Draco didn't want to ask, but that Harry knew was there. Once again Draco is grateful, and infuriated by that feeling. He doesn't like being easily read, but he presses what Harry has just told him as close to his chest as his hand is pressing now. He needed to know that, that he would have control of that still. He feels something loosen in his chest, some fear that's burrowed deep inside sighing away, and he finally eases his hand from his chest. He runs his fingers through his hair. \n\u201cAnd you\u2026 resolved it quickly, you said?\u201d His voice has regained its usual timbre, and he\u2019s fighting not to feel embarrassed. Something good just happened; he doesn't want to lose it in the fog of self-consciousness. \nHarry laughs, and it\u2019s loud and relieved, and genuine. Draco feels so glad to hear it he can\u2019t even muster to energy to wonder why.\n\u201cWell, I\u2019d like to say I did a daring feat of magic, but I actually just,\u201d Harry rubs a hand over his jaw, \u201celbowed him in the solar plexus, swore a lot, and then left. He\u2019s working his shit out with someone else now, and before you ask, yes, there are ways to prevent an Alpha from being able to try and make a claim like that.\u201d Harry looks away. \u201cI just didn't have them implemented.\u201d \n\u201cWhy the fuck not?\u201d Draco can\u2019t stop himself from blurting. \nHarry\u2019s lips twist as he tries to contain his smile, but his eyes are lit up with it. \u201cI\u2019ve been told I can be a little bit reckless.\u201d\nDraco\u2019s laugh is silent, almost a wheeze of a sound as it gusts out of him. Fucking Potter. Of course he would overlook something like that. Draco finds the familiar exasperation comforting. \n\u201cI have to ask, then.\u201d He carefully lets his hands lay on top of his contract again. \u201cWhy that\u2019s not mentioned in here?\u201d He flicks his eyes down to the contract, and then back up again. Harry sighs, puffing his cheeks out. \n\u201cGood question. But I already told you the answer.\u201d\n\u201cBecause you don\u2019t think it\u2019s a risk?\u201d Draco asks, and he can hear the slight disbelief in his voice. \u201cYou don\u2019t think I'm a risk?\u201d\n\u201cYes, in a way.\u201d Harry tilts his head to the left. \u201cMostly it\u2019s because I trust you.\u201d\nDraco can\u2019t respond to that. He wants to, but it\u2019s a full fifteen seconds before he can get his voice to work. \u201cIs that wise?\u201d he manages after another three seconds of shocked gaping. He can\u2019t think of a single reason why Harry should trust him, and any number of reasons why he shouldn't. Harry, though, doesn't look phased in the slightest. His expression is unyielding, confident and pleased, and he folds his arms in something that could almost be a challenge. \n\u201cI think it\u2019s wise, yes,\u201d Harry says, picking a leaf off the table and throwing it on the ground casually. \u201cI thought it was before today, and I\u2019m certain of it now.\u201d \nDraco opens his mouth, closes it again. He scratches at his shoulder, let's his nails slip under the sleeve of his t-shirt and rake gently over the bump of it. \u201cAll right,\u201d he mutters, still slightly poleaxed by Harry\u2019s declaration, and more than a little warmed by it. \u201cJust do me a favour and keep your elbows ready, though?\u201d he half jokes, half implores. Harry might trust him, but Draco\u2019s never done this before; he\u2019s not sure he fully trusts himself, yet, but he suspects, for the first time, that that\u2019s been most of his problem all along.\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay, Draco,\u201d Harry says and Draco almost shivers at the tone, the familiarity of it. \u201cBut if it makes you feel better, I\u2019ve got the quickest elbows in London.\u201d\nHarry\u2019s smile is lopsided and Draco nods, buoyed by Harry\u2019s confidence. He\u2019s about to reply, to think of something to say that will snap through the startling affection he\u2019s feeling for Harry, but Harry suddenly stands. He quickly walks around to the other side of the table, then sits again, legs straddling the stone bench beside Draco. Draco blinks, lips parting as he turns his body to better look at Harry. \nHe can\u2019t think of a single thing to say that isn\u2019t either redundant, insipid, or the word \u2018um\u2019. Wisely he says nothing, only raises one eyebrow at Harry\u2019s unexpected change of position. \n\u201cOkay, so,\u201d Harry starts gently, almost bashfully. He reaches out, tapping the tips of two fingers to Draco\u2019s contract. \u201cI think we\u2019ve actually covered the section that was up next,\u201d his smile is open, easy, \u201cwhich was item two on the agenda \u2015 the hard nos. I feel like we\u2019ve been pretty comprehensive about that?\u201d\nHe looks questioningly at Draco, who is still a little too taken aback by the sudden proximity to register he needs to reply. \u201cOh,\u201d Draco looks away and then back again. He smiles back, and it's not as open as Harry\u2019s but it\u2019s getting there. \u201cYes, I think so. No biting,\u201d he says. \n\u201cNo biting,\u201d Harry taps the side of his neck with his index finger, \u201chere,\u201d he corrects softly. \u201cOther places are okay.\u201d Draco follows the movement of his fingers slowly, letting his eyes track slowly back up to Harry\u2019s mouth. \n\u201cOkay,\u201d he says breathily, then swallows, surprised by his own voice. He shifts a little, then impulsively swings his own leg over the seat until he\u2019s straddling it too. It gives him something to do, at least, and Harry certainly looks surprised by the move, as Draco's position mirrors his own. \n\u201cWhat\u2019re we doing, Harry?\u201d Draco asks in a conspiratorial whisper, and Harry laughs. Draco likes that even more. \n\u201cThis is item three on the agenda,\u201d Harry mumbles, looking at Draco\u2019s mouth and then back up to his eyes. Harry\u2019s cheeks are a little pink again, that faint blush creeping over them again. It makes his eyes look bright, almost feverish. Draco likes it. He\u2019d be lying if he said he\u2019d never noticed Harry was good looking before, but he\u2019s never looked at him up quite this close up, never registered exactly how attractive he is. Or perhaps, Draco wonders, the difference is that he\u2019s never let himself properly notice how attracted he is to Harry. Either way, he feels he is\u2026 permitted to notice it now. He licks his lips, feels a little warm himself when he sees Harry\u2019s eyes follow the movement. \n\u201cItem three is face each other on a bench?\u201d Draco asks quietly, somewhat facetiously. He\u2019s finding himself curiously thrilled every time Harry laughs, every time Draco makes him laugh. \n\u201cNo. Ah.\u201d Harry\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple bobs as he swallows. \u201cIt\u2019s to assess our compatibility.\u201d He doesn\u2019t bother with the faux professional tone this time, but Draco thinks they don\u2019t need it, anymore; there\u2019s a tension between them still, but it\u2019s different now. \n\u201cOh,\u201d Draco clears his throat, frowning a little. \u201cHow exactly does one test for that?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a pretty effective way.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d Draco prompts, pretending to be focussed on brushing a leaf off of his shoulder but really, he\u2019s hanging off of Harry\u2019s every word. \n\u201cKiss.\u201d\nDraco looks up sharply, the leaf slipping from his fingers. He lets his hands drop down to his lap, sits a little straighter. Whatever he was expecting, it was not that. He makes himself meet Harry\u2019s eyes. \n\u201cHere?\u201d he asks, trying to focus on the practicalities of the situation and not on the dizzy feeling creeping over him at the idea of kissing Harry. Harry nods, and he looks as though a little of his composure is slipping. Not out of embarrassment, Draco surmises, and not exactly nervousness, although Harry does look a little jumpy, and a little wired. Draco thinks this is the same energy that made Harry want to get outdoors, away from the sensory overload of the crowds. \n\u201cHere is good,\u201d Harry says a little absently, rubbing his palms over his denim-clad thighs. \u201cIf you, if that\u2019s okay with you, that is,\u201d he adds, exhaling shakily. \u201cI mean, there\u2019s other ways, but this is...pretty bulletproof.\u201d Harry trails off. \nHe moves his hand to his shoulder again, rubbing over that same spot as he had earlier, and Draco watches the motion, then looks around. There\u2019s no one nearby, not that he can see, and when he closes his eyes and focusses, he finds he can\u2019t hear anyone either. He wonders if that would stop him. He's never kissed a man in public before, never really thought too much about why that is. He lets his eyes open, glances back at Harry, who is still gently rubbing over the same spot at the base of his neck, and staring at Draco\u2019s collarbone.\n\u201cHere is fine,\u201d Draco agrees quietly, feeling a rush of adrenaline as soon as he\u2019s said it. Harry looks up at him, dropping his hand back to his thigh as though he\u2019s only just noticed what he was doing. \n\u201cOh, good,\u201d Harry breathes, and Draco leans a little closer. He has no idea what he\u2019s doing, but Harry responds to it, their knees bumping against each other and his brows furrowing as he watches Draco\u2019s face. Draco leans a little closer still, until he can almost brush his lips against the corner of Harry\u2019s mouth.\n\u201cI assume we don\u2019t need to negotiate this?\u201d he mumbles, and he can feel Harry\u2019s breath gust over his mouth as he laughs, roughly. \n\u201cNo, this is,\u201d Harry\u2019s lips catch on Draco\u2019s as he talks, his head tilting as he leans into Draco, too, \u201cjust like any kiss.\u201d\nThe words are faint, trailing off, as Draco presses his lips softly against Harry\u2019s bottom lip. He does it again, feels Harry sigh against his mouth as he pulls at his lips softly with his own, and then again. It\u2019s softer than Draco thought it might be, gentle but not tentative. He can feel Harry\u2019s somewhat shaky breaths, the rise and fall of his chest as Draco lets the knuckles of one hand rest against his ribs, but still they move at the same slow pace. \nDraco can feel his heart, still thumping with adrenaline, as it beats in his chest, can still smell the wisteria petals on the lake, the leaves as they rustle above the gazebo, and something else, now, too. He can feel Harry\u2019s pulse, a staccato rhythm, against the backs of his fingers as he brushes them over Harry\u2019s t-shirt, feels the heat of his skin underneath it. It\u2019s rhythmic, intoxicating, and Draco wants to kiss Harry harder, wants to pull him against him, but he doesn\u2019t. Instead, he lets himself just feel it. His head is spinning slightly, that scent he can\u2019t place making him furrow his brow, open his mouth distractedly as Harry\u2019s lips move more insistently against his own. \nIt\u2019s familiar, the scent, something Draco has been aware of all day but hasn\u2019t known how to place it, how to acknowledge it, and he inhales sharply when it finally hits him. Harry, he thinks, moving his lips faster to match Harry\u2019s pace. It\u2019s Harry. \n\u201cFuck,\u201d Draco mumbles, letting his free hand rest against Harry\u2019s thigh, against the warm denim. Clean, he thinks, Harry smells clean, and warm, and like something else. Something that reminds him off vanilla, of fresh cut grass, of burnt sugar and cold limes muddled over alcohol. Draco lifts his hand from Harry\u2019s thigh, move it to his shoulder, and feels Harry shiver as he rubs over the spot Harry had touched earlier. \nAlmost immediately, the tension bleeds out of Harry\u2019s shoulders, his brows furrowing as he distractedly pushes his glasses up onto the top of his head and deepens the kiss. He makes a soft sound when Draco\u2019s tongue touches his, moving one hand to Draco\u2019s collarbone, to the neck of his shirt. Harry hooks them there, the first hint of what he\u2019s holding back, and his knees press against Draco\u2019s insistently as he rises up slightly, fingers pulling at the neck of Draco\u2019s t-shirt. \nDraco leans into it, gasping slightly. He suddenly thinks he could pull Harry into his lap, could slide his hand up the back of his shirt and feel Harry\u2019s skin against his bare palms, his body against his own, and he groans. He could do it, he thinks, feeling Harry\u2019s juddering heartbeat against his fingers, Harry\u2019s mouth insistent against his own. He could do it, but Harry said this would be just like any other kiss, and so Draco slides his hand over Harry\u2019s chest, up to his throat, and gently, with forefinger and middle, pushes him back. \nHarry\u2019s eyes snap open immediately. \n\u201cOh, holy shit,\u201d he mutters, blinking and resting his forehead, his nose against Draco\u2019s. \u201cSorry,\u201d he says emphatically. \u201cShit, sorry. That was not meant to be like that.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Draco\u2019s voice is rough and he clears his throat. \u201cIt\u2019s more than fine,\u201d he whispers. \u201cI assume that was what you meant by...effective?\u201d he mumbles. \n\u201cGod, that was \u2015 yeah.\u201d Harry laughs shakily. \u201cAren\u2019t you glad we did that here?\u201d he mumbles against Draco\u2019s lips. Draco tilts into it slightly, frowning. \n\u201cWhy?\u201d he whispers.\n\u201cBecause we can't do anything more than this.\u201d Harry\u2019s lips move against his own, before he drops his head to Draco\u2019s shoulder with a soft groan. \u201cNot that I apparently didn\u2019t try.\u201d\nDraco makes a sound himself, resting his cheek against Harry\u2019s head. His hair is soft, the curls against the stubble at his jaw, and Draco stares out at the park behind them. He lets that scent settle over him again, as he waits for his heartbeat to settle, for Harry\u2019s breathing to even out. \nHe\u2019d always imagined an Omega\u2019s scent would be overwhelming, overpowering, but it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s sweet, in a way, and rich, almost like the way new earth feels. He inhales again deeply, watching a middle-aged woman and a man walk past. The woman looks at them and Draco glances away quickly. He stiffens, wondering what kind of a sight he and Harry might make, but it\u2019s hardly obscene. Harry\u2019s breathing is still uneven, rough, but the couple can\u2019t see that; all they have is a view of two people, in a slightly haphazard embrace. \nWhen the woman looks back at them Draco holds her gaze. He\u2019s amazed when she simply smiles back, and as he watches them meander further up the path, Draco can\u2019t help but laugh. \n\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry says, tensing. His voice is a little strained, and he starts to lift his head, but Draco impulsively smooths a hand over Harry\u2019s back.\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Draco says. He cards his fingers through Harry\u2019s hair, then rests them at his nape. At Harry\u2019s soft sigh, he rubs over the spot. \u201cIs this what you\u2019ll be like?\u201d he asks gently, curiosity and warmth running through him. Harry hums, then nods. \n\u201cSomething like this, yeah,\u201d he says shakily. \u201cWe should...We should head off now.\u201d He starts to lift his head again, and Draco lets him this time. He can\u2019t stop the wave of disappointment he feels; he isn\u2019t quite ready to leave this yet, he finds. Something of it must show on his face, and Harry smiles as he settles his glasses over his slightly-too bright eyes. \n\u201cItem four on the agenda,\u201d he explains gently, still looking a little dazed. Draco forces himself to look away from the mesmerising bloom of red on the apples of Harry\u2019s cheeks and down at the contract. He\u2019d managed to almost entirely forget about that. \n\u201cAh. The Full Disclosure,\u201d he mutters, moving his hand towards the dotted line that needs his signature. \u201cCan\u2019t we just \u2015\u201d \n\u201cNo, don\u2019t sign it here.\u201d Harry\u2019s fingers are warm over Draco\u2019s as he pulls them away from the contract. He releases them again, after a moment. \u201cWe should sign these somewhere,\u201d he looks around them, \u201csomewhere a little more private.\u201d \n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s Charmed. It will, well. We need to be honest with each other, about any mitigating circumstances, about any way this might negatively impact either of us.\u201d Harry looks apprehensive, and Draco nods. \n\u201cYou mentioned your house?\u201d he replies softly, and something in Harry\u2019s posture relaxes. \n\u201cYeah.\u201d He breathes out. \u201cYeah, if you don\u2019t mind? We could go to yours, of course, but I\u2019m...\u201d Harry trails off. \n\u201cYou\u2019re?\u201d Draco prompts. Harry laughs, self-deprecatingly. His cheeks are still red, his voice a little hoarse. \n\u201cStupid really. This close to the heat, though, your place. It will be full of you, your things, your scent, pheromones.\u201d He licks his lips, a flash of pink tongue. Draco can\u2019t stop himself from staring at it. \u201cIt will be better if we go somewhere where I\u2019m less likely to not be able to control myself.\u201d He laughs again, that slightly bashful sound. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s good in the sense that compatibility is clearly not going to be an issue. Not remotely.\u201d He shakes his head in slight wonder, then bites at the side of his lip. \u201cBut you're kind of driving me mad, and it hasn\u2019t even started yet. \u201d\nDraco blinks, taken aback. In all the time he\u2019d imagined being near an Omega during their heat, he\u2019d never thought about losing control being an issue for them. He\u2019d always pictured himself, the beast lurching inside his chest and clouding over his mind, taking and taking and taking, but he\u2019d never stopped to consider it might be the same on the other side of the coin. He thinks of Harry, the feverish tension of that kiss, the urge Draco had felt to pull Harry into his lap \u2015 and Harry\u2019s near attempt to do it. Draco realises he was the one to stop that, to pull back when needed. He clutches at that thought, wrapping his mind around it, and for the first time since this began, since he was bitten perhaps, he feels like perhaps he has more control of himself than he ever realised. \nIt\u2019s a good feeling. \n\u201cShall we walk there?\u201d Draco offers, and Harry hums again, nodding. His face is still flushed, but he looks like he\u2019s regaining his composure, slowly. Draco can\u2019t even quantify how much he likes knowing that he was the reason for it, that kissing him, being close to his scent, has affected Harry like this. The rush it brings him is almost enough to make him dizzy, and he makes a soft sound of wonder at that. Harry\u2019s right; it hasn\u2019t even started yet, and yet Draco feels more alive, alert and aroused, than he has in longer than he can recall. \n\u201cI\u2019ll lead the way,\u201d Harry says, standing and gathering up the contract. Draco follows suit, following Harry out of the quiet and shade of the latticed gazebo and out into the sun.\n*\nHarry\u2019s house has a rather splendid garden, but item four, Harry informs him insistently, is best done indoors.\n\u201cSomewhere safe, and quiet,\u201d he says, as he opens the back door then leads Draco inside. \nHarry\u2019s house is not what Draco expects. His living room, which leads to the back garden, is large, nicely furnished \u2015 and also absolutely cluttered with a family\u2019s worth of detritus. \n\u201cYou have a child?\u201d he asks, stepping around a stuffed toy. There are drawings pinned to the walls, childish and bright and hung with the kind of reverence parents reserve for the creations of their children. Draco remembers seeing his mother, his father, treat his own scribbles this way, as they wobbled on spindly legs across his Charmed parchments. These ones are better than his, though. They\u2019re even not half bad, for clearly being done by someone under ten. \n\u201cWhat? Oh, no,\u201d Harry laughs, picking the stuffed toy duck up off the floorboards and throwing it into a small wicker basket by the sofa. Draco sees it\u2019s full of other toys, colourful wooden blocks and plush animals. \u201cNo, just godchildren.\u201d Harry rubs his hand over his jaw, then keeps walking into the adjoining kitchen. \u201cTeddy is the artist,\u201d Harry waves a hand at the wall, a note of pride in his voice. \u201cAnd Rose is the fan of ducks. She\u2019s mad for them, really. It\u2019s sweet.\u201d He smiles at Draco\u2019s polite confusion. \u201cShe\u2019s Ron and Hermione\u2019s daughter,\u201d he explains. \u201cI babysit a lot. And I spoil her. Both her and Teddy,\u201d he adds, with that same note of pride, of happiness, creeping into his voice, and a little bit of defiance too. I spoil my godchildren and just try and stop me, Draco thinks the set of Harry\u2019s jaw is saying, and he wonders slightly why it means as much to Harry as it clearly does. \n\u201cWell.\u201d Draco breathes out, manages a smile. \u201cLittle children should be spoiled.\u201d Harry laughs, and Draco braces for the cutting remark about him, his own parents and his rotten behaviour back at school, but it doesn't come. Harry just looks a little pleased with himself, but there\u2019s something fierce and somewhat sad in his slightly bright eyes. \n\u201cThey should,\u201d he croaks, then clears his throat. \u201cThey should be loved. And know it,\u201d he says quietly, and Draco knows there\u2019s something more there, but he doesn\u2019t feel it\u2019s his place to ask. \n\u201cTeddy...Lupin?\u201d he asks softly, and Harry inclines his head in a yes. \u201cThere\u2019s a familial relation there,\u201d Draco adds, somewhat uselessly. Harry would know that, already, but Draco\u2019s fishing for a change in conversation, feeling Harry\u2019s slight discomfort as keenly as if it was his own. \n\u201cYes, he\u2019s your second cousin I think.\u201d\n\u201cFirst cousin once removed,\u201d Draco corrects, smiling a little wider at Harry\u2019s surprised expression. \u201cWhen you come from a family like mine, you learn how to calculate relations rather quickly,\u201d he explains quietly. He doesn\u2019t really want to talk about his family. He suspects it will end in a fight, especially as he can\u2019t quite read the meaning behind the set of Harry\u2019s jaw. \u201cIt\u2019s the best way to avoid any accidental incest,\u201d Draco adds, and Harry laughs, sudden and sharp. \n\u201cDon\u2019t want any Malfoys with seven toes?\u201d he says, his tone lighter than before, and Draco shakes his head curtly, trying not to smile.\n\u201cPerish the thought.\u201d He purses his lips, then adds, \u201cIt wouldn't be the first time it\u2019s happened, though.\u201d\nHarry laughs again, setting the kettle to boil with a flick of his wand as they enter the slightly cleaner kitchen. It\u2019s decorated in cool whites and yellow, and Draco likes it. He never expected Harry would have good taste. \n\u201cThat all falls on your shoulders, yeah?\u201d Harry says, fussing with tea bags and mugs; Draco nods when Harry lifts one in an offer. \u201cThe production of future Malfoys, with the correct amount of toes,\u201d Harry continues. Draco looks away. \nIt\u2019s asked lightly, nothing in it but genuine curiosity or perhaps a desire for a polite change of direction in the conversation, but Draco feels an icy trickle down his spine. \n\u201cI\u2019m sure seven toes would be preferable to some people in my family than any child of mine, considering they would be less than entirely human.\u201d He swallows, thickly, hating himself for that answer, and for the truth in it. He isn\u2019t sure how his father would treat any children he had, although he\u2019s sure his mother would love them. It would always be there, though, that disappointment that they aren\u2019t the grandchildren, the future of the lineage, that they wanted. It makes Draco almost furious to think of it. The anger disappears as soon as he looks up and sees Harry\u2019s expression. \nHe looks like he\u2019s been slapped. \n\u201cDo\u2026 Do you feel like that?\u201d he asks, an almost frantic note in it. Draco before he responds, taken aback by the emotion he sees in Harry\u2019s eyes, etched across his face. He looks worried, upset, and Draco feels awful for being the cause of that. The rush of empathy is unexpected, and unpleasant. He licks his lips, knowing his answer obviously means something here, and he tries to think of what he should say, but he quickly discards that notion. He goes for honest. \n\u201cI couldn\u2019t give a flying fuck what they were,\u201d he says, folding his arms. \u201cIf I\u2019m ever lucky enough to have a child, then,\u201d Draco folds his arms tighter, feeling oddly exposed, \u201cthen they could be green for all that I\u2019d care,\u201d he says with feeling, and he means it. He\u2019s never talked about this with anyone, but he\u2019s always wanted children. Heirs, sure, he and Pansy used to gloat about how they were going to produce heirs, but Draco never really cared about that. It was all lip service to what his parents had drilled into him was important. As he got older, he realised he didn\u2019t care so much about carrying on the Malfoy bloodline; he just wanted to be a father, to raise a child. He wondered if he\u2019d be good at it. He wondered if he\u2019d ever get a chance at it. It made him furious to imagine his own father, or mother, might not treasure a child of his because of what Draco was now. He finally forces himself to look up and gauge Harry\u2019s response to his answer. \nHarry\u2019s frown hasn\u2019t eased, but his shoulders relax, tension ebbing out of him as he sighs. He nods, looking as if that answer meant more to him than Draco can reasonably fathom. He blinks down at ther tea mugs, shaking his head when he realises he\u2019s left the tea bags in too long. His hands shake as he tries to open the carton of milk, and he spills a little, then gives up. Draco hasn\u2019t had the heart to tell him he takes his tea black. He feels unaccountably unhappy at seeing Harry upset. \n\u201cRemus was a werewolf,\u201d Harry says, handing Draco a mug of the slightly oversteeped tea. \u201cAs you know. That doesn\u2019t mean. Teddy\u2019s not...he\u2019s not less than human,\u201d Harry says, his voice thick with emotion, and Draco nods, chagrined. \n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to upset you,\u201d he says, setting his tea down and feeling his stomach flip uncomfortably. He suddenly feels awful for what he said, for the carelessness of his words; he\u2019d completely forgotten about Teddy\u2019s father, and as well, how much Teddy and his parents\u2019 memory must mean to Harry. \u201cI should perhaps go before I can \u2015\u201d clumsily stick my foot any farther into my own stupid mouth, he\u2019s about to say, when Harry interrupts. \n\u201cNo!\u201d Harry sets his hand on Draco's elbow, urging him to stay where he is. \u201cNo, no, please stay, I\u2019m not upset. Well, I am, but not with you, anyway. I always feel\u2026\u201d Harry shakes his head. \u201cJust more, around this time of the season. It\u2019s not bad, it\u2019s just...hard to hide when something bothers me.\u201d He looks down, and then up at Draco through his fringe. \u201cMaybe you can relate?\u201d\nDraco tilts his head. He considers admitting that he got turned on by a peach the other day, that he felt murderously angry at just the idea of someone doing something Harry didn\u2019t like, but he\u2019s aiming for at least a little bit of self-preservation. Instead, he lets himself say, \u201cYes. I can empathise with that.\u201d He waits a beat, then quietly adds, \u201cI\u2019m sure your godson is a wonderful child.\u201d\nHarry sighs, shakes his hair away from his face. \u201cShall we\u2026?\u201d Harry gestures for them to head to the small sitting room which adjoins the kitchen. There\u2019s a sofa in there, large with soft cushions, coloured a deep, dark blue. Draco sits next to Harry, nursing his tea. It tastes a little bitter, but he savours it all the same, glad he hasn\u2019t messed something up too badly. He\u2019s glad Harry doesn't want him to leave, that the silence between them feels charged but not angry, or uncomfortable. He waits until Harry speaks again.\n\u201cThat\u2019s how my aunt and uncle felt about me, you know,\u201d he says softly. \u201cI think it would have been preferable for them if I\u2019d been anything other than what I was. Well. Maybe not. They might have disliked having to look after me no matter who or what I was. But either way, they very much didn\u2019t want me, and didn\u2019t bother to hide it.\u201d Draco blinks, taken aback, by the words, and as well by the matter of fact way in which Harry says it. There\u2019s little to no emotion in it, just a kind of deep resignation that makes Draco\u2019s chest ache; for all his parents\u2019 flaws, he always grew up knowing he was cherished. He can\u2019t really imagine not having had that as a child. \n\u201cMe not being their kind of normal,\u201d Harry continues, tapping his finger against the mug. \u201cThat bothered them. And now, I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t like the idea of people thinking about Teddy like that, or any\u2026\u201d He pauses, sucking on his lower lip. \u201cAny kids I would have, or you would have.\u201d He takes a sip of tea, swallows with some effort. \u201cChildren should be loved,\u201d he says, echoing his earlier sentiments, and Draco looks away, staring down into his tea mug. \nThere are a thousand questions stirring inside him, about Harry\u2019s family, about why he hasn't had children of his own given he clearly adores his godchildren so much, but he doesn't voice them. It feels too personal a thing to ask, and Harry might ask him the same. He doesn\u2019t think, though, that Harry wants sympathy from him, or platitudes. He suspects Harry is just being honest. Still, Draco doesn't really want to talk about that, not just now at least. Strangely, he can imagine talking about it with Harry someday. The realization is bizarre to say the least, but he likes Harry\u2019s bluntness, his determination not to avoid the less than pleasant topics that come up between them. Once upon a time, they would have dissolved into a fight at the first hint of a differing opinion, a misused word, and Draco knows they still easily could. He finds that now, though, that while they know where each other's buttons are, how to get a reaction out of Harry, he doesn\u2019t want to make his temper rise. It\u2019s as satisfying, if not more so, to make him laugh, see his cheeks flush. He suspects Harry is doing the same, using the same desire to rile the other up that they\u2019ve both been carrying since they were eleven to different effect now. It\u2019s unexpected, and rather refreshing, exhilarating. Draco runs his finger around the lip of his mug, runs his tongue over his teeth in contemplation. \n\u201cFor what it\u2019s worth.\u201d He turns to Harry, finds him watching Draco with that avid stare. \u201cMy parents, their attitudes. They\u2019re...somewhat old fashioned,\u201d he says quietly. It\u2019s as close as he can get to saying outright that he doesn\u2019t share their world views anymore. He feels his cheeks warm when Harry smiles at him. \n\u201cThat\u2019s a very diplomatic way to put it.\u201d\n\u201cYes, well,\u201d Draco takes a sip of tea, crossing one leg over the other. \u201cI\u2019m too polite to call it what it really is.\u201d He allows himself a small smile, delights in the lopsided grin it earns from Harry. \n\u201cYou are many things, Draco, but I\u2019ve never thought of you as polite.\u201d\nDraco sniffs. \u201cFuck off,\u201d he drawls, feeling his heart rate kick up a little at the fondness in Harry\u2019s eyes. \u201cI\u2019m impeccably polite. You just haven\u2019t always appreciated my manners.\u201d\nHarry laughs, and then exhales, the last of the tension easing out of him. \u201cWell. That was an unexpected turn of conversation,\u201d he says, smiling a little wryly. \n\u201cYes,\u201d Draco replies, pursing his lips. \u201cShall we add that to a list of topics to delicately skirt around?\u201d\nHarry shakes his head. \u201cThat would just make it even more necessary for us to talk about it, don\u2019t you think?\u201d He rests his head back against the sofa, something a little tired in his expression. He doesn't look upset anymore, and Draco feels such a rush of warmth at that that he can\u2019t quite explain it. He sits back against the sofa himself, his tea delicately placed on pack of cards on the coffee table, given there are no coasters. He magnanimously doesn\u2019t chide Harry about this entertaining faux pas. \n\u201cMerlin, you are determined to be abominably upfront, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\nHarry bites his lip, setting his own mug on the floor. \u201cYep.\u201d\n\u201cA sort of perpetual full disclosure, then?\u201d he offers softly, and Harry\u2019s lips twitch. \u201cIt\u2019s terribly un-British of you,\u201d Draco murmurs, lifting one brow. Harry\u2019s smile widens. \n\u201cYeah,\u201d he laughs. \u201cGuess that\u2019s sort of how I live my life now.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve noticed.\u201d Draco pulls his contract out of his pocket, if only for a reason to look away from the warmth in Harry\u2019s expression. \u201cSo, I still don\u2019t think I entirely understand what the purpose of this is.\u201d He unfolds the parchment. \u201cOr why you\u2019re dreading it, considering you\u2019re quite bloody open about everything else?\u201d he suggests lightly. \nHarry pulls a face. \u201cIt\u2019s just a little invasive,\u201d he admits, lifting his hips off the sofa so he can pull out his own copy from his jeans pocket. \u201cIt\u2019s charmed, I think I mentioned. It will make me, and you, disclose anything mitigating, anything that could jeopardise a successful and healthy working arrangement. Sex is\u2026\u201d Harry shrugs. \u201cIntimate. It\u2019s best that we know all there is to know about each other and anything that might negatively impact us. The contract will, when you sign that section, it will make you say it. Involuntarily, anything I need to know. Anything that would mean we should stop here and not go any further.\u201d Harry sighs. \u201cI hate it,\u201d he says lightly. \nDraco looks at Harry, stunned. \u201cIs that why you\u2019re not looking forward to it?\u201d he asks, and Harry nods, nose wrinkled. \n\u201cMmm.\u201d Harry shifts against the cushions, pulling one over his lap and hugging it to himself. \u201cBecause I suspect I know what I\u2019m going to say. And I\u2019m not looking forward to it.\u201d\nDraco slowly turns back to the contract. \u201cIs it going to be a succinct summary of our entire history together?\u201d he says, apprehensively. \u201cBecause I\u2019d hazard that would all come under \u2018negatively impacting us\u2019.\u201d His voice sounds a little hollow, mirroring the feeling in the pit of his stomach. He\u2019s suddenly quite certain that this is going to be end of their arrangement, before it\u2019s even begun; even if it\u2019s all been relegated to water under the bridge, of a sorts, there is still a lot of it there. \nHarry though, doesn't look quite so bleak. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s not quite like that.\u201d He sits up, unrolling his parchment, and Summoning a quill to sign with. He taps the feathered end against his wrist. \u201cWe already know all about that, don\u2019t we?\u201d he explains. \u201cThat\u2019s all on the surface, as it were. What this,\u201d he taps the feather against Draco\u2019s contract, \u201cwill do is make us confess things to each other that we don\u2019t already know.\u201d He sniffs, then brushes the feather against his chin. \u201cAll you have to do is sign, and then anything the Disclosure Charm thinks I need to know will just...\u201d he sticks his tongue out, miming something falling out of his mouth. \n\u201cDo we sign...together?\u201d Draco asks, still apprehensive and baffled. \u201cOr shall I go first?\u201d he offers, itching to get this over with. \n\u201cOh, yes, of course.\u201d Harry hands him the quill, his fingers brushing against Draco's as he does so. \u201cIf you like, you can go first.\u201d\nDraco tightens his fingers against the quill, pressing the nib to the parchment. He steadies it against his knee, signing as quickly as he can. He wants to get this over with as fast as humanly possible. He can\u2019t stop the sinking feeling in his gut that whatever this is going to make him say, isn\u2019t going to be good, but it\u2019s more than that. Today has been nice, more than nice in places. He doesn\u2019t like the notion that he\u2019s about to blurt something out which will change whether this happens again, and he really, really doesn\u2019t want to hear what Harry will say in return. He finishes signing his slightly wobblier-than-usual signature with a flourish, then sits back. He braces himself for whatever he\u2019s about to confess. \nNothing happens. \n\u201cWell,\u201d he clears his throat, continuing in an unimpressed tone, \u201cI don\u2019t think that worked at a \u2015 I\u2019m scared I won\u2019t be able to knot you.\u201d He blinks, looking down at his lap, but he\u2019s talking again before he can really process what\u2019s happen. \u201cI\u2019m scared I won\u2019t be able to knot you, and terrified about what will happen if I do, how it will feel. I\u2019m also far more attracted to you than I feel comfortable admitting, and I\u2019m confronted by the way that you make me feel better about myself. I like it. It confuses me.\u201d Draco licks his lips, feeling his face start to colour with humiliated stains of red, one high on each cheekbone. \u201cAnd whenever I feel like that, in the past I usually lash out, which I know is defensive and hurtful, but I do it anyway.\u201d Draco opens his mouth, refusing to look at Harry. He feels like an idiotic goldfish, his eyes wide and his mouth half-open, as he waits to see if the Charm wants to dredge any other mortifying admissions from him. He\u2019s furious when he hears what he says next. \n\u201cI don\u2019t like people seeing the scars on my body, not only the ones you put there and the stupid one I let Him put there, but the bite scar as well, because they make me feel weak, and on top of the kidney damage it caused it just looks awf \u2015 fucking hell!\" Draco cuts himself off, clenching his teeth together. \nIt\u2019s only through merit of being raised to be incredibly well-mannered that Draco doesn\u2019t grab the cushion off of Harry\u2019s lap and cram it into his own mouth. He folds his arms instead, glaring at the contract, and internally daring it to make him say anything else. He wants to rip the stupid thing up. \n\u201cAnd I don't want to lose control, bite you, hurt you,\u201d he grinds out through gritted teeth, feeling the last of the compulsion to speak ebb away when he adds, \u201cduring the rut.\u201d He opens his mouth one last time, testing whether he has full control over what comes out of it, then clacks his teeth together. \n\u201cThat had better be bloody it,\u201d he snarls, turning belligerently to Harry. He looks away again quickly, cringing. \u201cOh Merlin, don\u2019t look at me like that!\u201d\nHarry\u2019s expression, stuck in one of shock and sympathy, twists into a kind of guilty confusion. It\u2019s everything Draco has been dreading since he heard himself mention the scars. \n\u201cDraco,\u201d Harry starts sincerely, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry about Sectum \u2015\u201d \n\u201cNo,\u201d Draco interrupts, cheeks flushing again, but this time angrily, indignant on not only his own behalf but also Harry\u2019s. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to apologise, we don\u2019t need to do this \u2015\u201d\nHarry holds his hand up, his expression earnest. \n\u201cI really didn\u2019t know what that spell did, I know it\u2019s no excuse, but I really didn\u2019t \u2015\u201d \n\u201cNo, Potter, Harry, this is ridiculous!\u201d Draco interrupts again. He sits up, flinging his contract onto the coffee table, and watching it slide almost to the opposite edge. \u201cI don\u2019t care that bloody much about the scars!\u201d He angrily rubs his jaw. \u201cAnd even if I do, there\u2019s no reason you should know about that. I mean is there?\u201d He turns furious eyes onto Harry. \u201cBecause from where I\u2019m sitting, all this has achieved is to make me feel awkward as all bloody hell, and make you feel shit about things that happened, by accident, eight sodding years ago!\u201d Draco lets his breath out in a furious rush, shaking his hair out of his eyes. \u201cWe don\u2019t need a stupid legal document to guilt trip you about using that curse. I know you didn\u2019t do it on purpose,\u201d he declares, and he means it. Of all the things the charm decided Harry needed to know, he can\u2019t fathom a single positive thing coming out of this one, and whether or not he doesn\u2019t like the fact that his upper half looks a little worse for wear is something for Draco and his own vanity, regrets and self esteem to grapple with. Not for Harry bloody Potter to beat himself up about. \nHarry looks gobsmacked. He turns away, lips twisting into an odd expression, a combination of surprise, relief. \u201cI had...I had rather thought you would end up yelling at me about that, instead of on my behalf.\u201d\n\u201cOh, god, it\u2019s,\u201d Draco shrugs one shoulder, \u201cwhat would be the point of that?\u201d He runs his fingers through his hair. \u201cI yell at you about a few scars, then you yell at me about, what, the first half of your life? It\u2019s hardly very fucking productive, is it?\u201d He sighs. \u201cI wasn\u2019t exactly a saint at school,\u201d he finishes, a little quieter but with no less conviction. \u201cAnd the others marks, they\u2019re...well those\u2019re my fault,\u201d he mumbles. \nHarry\u2019s brows crease into a small frown. He opens his mouth, as if to protest, before he stops himself, thinking better of it. In the end he asks softly, \u201cHow bad is it?\u201d He gestures with two fingers. \u201cThe bite scar.\u201d\nDraco sighs, then scratches his ear. He shrugs, noncommittally, then drops his head back to rest against the sofa. It\u2019s surprisingly comfortable. \u201cCould have been worse,\u201d he mumbles. \n\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\n\u201cIt means the Healers weren\u2019t sure if the fucker was trying to turn me or eviscerate me,\u201d Draco replies, a little snappily, \u201cso considering all I lost was the full use of one kidney and gained in its place the directive to take good care of myself and moderate my alcohol intake, I repeat, it could have been worse.\u201d He turns to Harry, and raises one eyebrow at his slightly startled expression. \u201cBesides, it looks like I\u2019m doing a fabulous job of ignoring Healers\u2019 orders and not looking after myself properly, so it\u2019s all rather a moot point. And I was never that partial to drinking anyway,\u201d he adds lightly.\nHarry licks his lips, holding eye contact. He looks like he\u2019s choosing his words, his eyes still a little unfocussed, the way they have been since they kissed. \u201cNo?\u201d Harry mumbles after a moment. \n\u201cNo,\u201d Draco tries to smile, and finds it actually feels sincere. \u201cIt makes my cheeks pink. Very undignified,\u201d he quips.\n\u201cYou do actually blush really easily, yeah.\u201d Harry grins, and it\u2019s toothy and real. Draco realises he\u2019s missed it, and before he knows it, he\u2019s grinning back.\n\u201cFuck you.\u201d Draco tries not to laugh. \u201cI do not.\u201d He feels some more of his discomfort over the things he said, and the aftermath of it, easing away. \n\u201cI don't think you need to worry,\u201d Harry says suddenly. \u201cAbout how the bite looks. I mean, I know that\u2019s not how that works, that me saying this doesn\u2019t change how you feel, but.\u201d The corner of his mouth slips up into a thoughtful smile. \u201cYou\u2019re very attractive.\u201d\nDraco feels his cheeks start to colour, flushing with confused and pleased warmth. \u201cWell. Um,\u201d Draco clears his throat, beyond flustered as he tries to think of a suitable response. The compliment is making his insides feel fluttery and uncooperative, and he\u2019d like to blame that on the hormones currently dizzying up his system, but he suspects Harry calling him fit would take him off guard at any time of the year. \u201cThank you,\u201d he manages. \n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Harry\u2019s eyes crinkle as his grin widens, the position of his head against the sofa making his glasses sit slightly askew. He looks younger, all of a sudden, a bit more like the boy Draco knew at school, and entirely different at the same time; Draco never saw Harry look at him like this back at Hogwarts. \u201cAnd you do blush easily,\u201d Harry repeats, almost cheekily. \u201cWhich is also very attractive.\u201d \nDraco barks a surprised laugh, running one hand over his hot cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re drunk on hormones right now, aren\u2019t you Potter?\u201d he says as blithely as he can, but his voice comes out a little scratchy. He forces himself not to look away. \nHarry shakes his head, hair catching against the back of the sofa. \u201cNo. Mildly tipsy, at best.\u201d The light glances off his glasses as he turns away, obscuring his eyes and making them hard to read. \u201cI\u2019ve noticed how you look before now.\u201d \nDraco makes a dismissive sound, hoping his face isn't still looking as warm as it feels. \n\u201cWell, thank you for validating my appearance. I feel so much better about myself knowing that the great Harry Potter approves,\u201d Draco drawls, ignoring the little voice inside him saying, admit it, you kind of do though. \u201cYou\u2019re not so bad yourself,\u201d he mumbles, wishing he had something to do with his hands. \nHarry clicks his tongue, running it over his teeth then pressing it into his cheek. \u201cYou already mentioned that, actually.\u201d \nDraco blinks, confused, then cringes. His eyes flit to the contract, then back to Harry\u2019s grinning face. He groans.\n\u201cBollocks.\u201d Draco laughs wryly. \u201cSo I did.\u201d He glares at the contract on the table. \u201cI can see why you hate that bit, now,\u201d he says with feeling. Harry\u2019s lips slant back up into that fond smile. \n\u201cYou know, it\u2019s kinda nice that,\u201d Harry\u2019s expression turns earnest, \u201cthat I make you feel a bit better about...this.\u201d He waves a hand at Draco\u2019s sides and Draco groans again, resting his elbow on the arm of the sofa and his head in his hand. \n\u201cOh for Circe\u2019s sake,\u201d he picks the quill up, flings it at Harry, \u201ccan we do you now? I\u2019d love to share some of this humiliation around.\u201d \nHarry laughs, catching the quill as it hits his chest. He bites his lip, then shrugs. \u201cGuess we\u2019d better.\u201d\nHe continues to chew at his lip, teeth worrying at the side of it, as he quickly scribbles his name in a familiar, untidy scrawl. He lays the quill down, sighing heavily and covering his mouth partly with his fingers, a smear of ink on one of them. His voice is a little muffled by them when he speaks. \n\u201cI used to want to have sex with you back when we were at Hogwarts.\u201d Harry takes a deep breath. \u201cIn sixth year. Possibly a bit before then, but I didn't really know what sex was or have much of an interest in it. But by sixth year, definitely. First guy I ever thought of like that, really. I\u2026 I\u2019m not sure what exactly I wanted, but it was sex, in so far as I knew how sex worked. I wanted to sleep with you. Do something with you. I still wanted to punch you in the face half the time, but the other half. Well.\u201d He shuts one eye, looking embarrassed. \u201cIt was weird.\u201d\nDraco waits. Harry looks at him sheepishly from under the fall of his slightly too long, and always too messy, hair. \n\u201cWait...That\u2019s it?\u201d Draco wonders softly, when another minute passes and Harry says nothing. \n\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry says quietly, still looking a little coy. \u201cGod.\u201d Harry shakes his head, fingers still partly over his mouth. \u201cI knew that was coming, I mean. I was pretty sure that was what I was going to end up saying. But it still.\u201d He makes a face, stick his tongue out briefly. Draco spreads his hands indignantly.\n\u201cWhat, no embarrassing body image issues, or, I don't know,\u201d he searches for something, \u201capprehension about what it will be like, whether I\u2019ll be able to, you know,\u201d he blanches, \u201cactually knot, because I'm pretty bloody sure you should be concerned about that. Just\u2026You liked me back at school?\u201d\n\u201cOh no. I didn't like you at all,\u201d Harry replies quietly. \u201cWhich I don't think will surprise you. I was attracted to you,\u201d Harry explains. \u201cLike I said, it was pretty bloody confusing, and a lot of the time I was just angry with you.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cBut, still. Thought about shagging you.\u201d He purses his lips, then scratches at his ear. Draco continues to struggle to process any of what Harry has just said.\n\u201cWhy is that even an issue?\u201d he eventually asks. \nHarry exhales heavily. \u201cWell, it might not be. But it's been bothering me.\u201d He settles back against the sofa, pulling one foot up and resting his forearm against his knee. \u201cThe same way the stuff you said has been bothering you, albeit on a pretty subconscious scale.\u201d He looks pensive, a little uncomfortable, and yet determined as he tries to choose his words. \u201cIt's been bothering me because it makes it seem like this is opportunistic,\u201d Harry says quickly, seriously. \u201cThat I'm only doing this to\u2026\u201d \n\u201cGet a leg over?\u201d Draco suggests softly, and Harry nods, once. \n\u201cYep.\u201d He scoffs, shaking his head. \u201cI wouldn't be surprised if you thought that.\u201d \n\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Draco replies honestly. \u201cI'm slightly too shocked by this information to form an opinion, I confess.\u201d \nHarry laughs, meeting his eyes again finally. \u201cWell, it's not opportunistic. For what that\u2019s worth. I'm doing this for the reasons I told you I was,\u201d Harry says, and it sounds heartfelt, his voice almost a little imploring. \n\u201cYou just also felt compelled to tell me that you thought I was fit roughly nine years ago?\u201d He keeps his voice light, wanting Harry to know he\u2019s not antagonising him. \n\u201cYeah.\u201d Harry closes his eyes, face tilted up towards the ceiling as he settles against the cushioned back of the sofa. \u201cJust felt like something I ought to be upfront about, considering what we\u2019re doing now.\u201d He licks his lips, then adds, \u201cI wasn\u2019t even sure if things would get this far, to be honest. Didn\u2019t really expect us to have much chemistry, you know?\u201d \nDraco nods, internally agreeing with a kind of baffled vehemence. He shakes his head, feeling a bit overwhelmed, too much new information and honesty swimming around in his head. It's not unpleasant, but he does feel like he\u2019s done an emotional relay here. \n\u201cIt\u2019s because you\u2019re much less annoying now,\u201d he says, and Harry barks a loud, relieved laugh, tilting his head to look at him fondly. \n\u201cYeah, you too,\u201d Harry agrees. His face is a little pale now, the bags under his eyes visible, and he stifles a yawn with the back of his hand. \n\u201cYou\u2019re tired,\u201d Draco states softly.\n\u201cI am knackered,\u201d Harry agrees with feeling. \n\u201cWell, I should probably be going,\u201d Draco says as he stands. \u201cAnd I assume we\u2019ll be in contact before...\u201d He stops himself from saying something self-deprecating like, before the big disappointment. In the surreal pleasantness of their afternoon together, he\u2019d managed to forget about the whole reason he\u2019d been advised to seek out Harry\u2019s services. He feels forcibly reminded of it now. Harry looks like he can tell. \n\u201cIt's not an issue, you know,\u201d Harry says abruptly, his knees clicking slightly as he stands too. \u201cIf you don\u2019t knot.\u201d He steps forward, almost chest to chest with Draco, looking up at him from his ever so slight height disadvantage. \u201cIt won't be an issue for me,\u201d he repeats. \nDraco swallows thickly. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t\u2026 I\u2019ve never,\u201d he shakes his head in frustration. \u201cWhat if it doesn't happen?\u201d he asks in a low whisper. \n\u201cThen we\u2019ll do other things,\u201d Harry replies easily. \u201cTo make you comfortable. Until it does. Until you\u2019re ready.\u201d He pulls his lower lip into his mouth, then releases it again. His eyes are unwavering as he regards Draco, and Draco feels pinned to the spot by them. \u201cAnd when you feel ready, when you want to and it feels right. Then it\u2019ll happen.\u201d \nDraco swallows again. He wants to protest that that's stupid, that if it were that simple it would have happened already, but something about what Harry says resonates with him. He\u2019s deeply relieved by it, too, but the apprehension about what\u2019s going to happen is still hard to shake. \n\u201cWill it hurt?\u201d he asks, his earlier admission still playing on his mind. \n\u201cYou?\u201d Harry frowns, and Draco shakes his head. \n\u201cWill it hurt you.\u201d Draco worries his lip, not wanting to elaborate. He feels silly, inexperienced and out of his depth in a way he hasn\u2019t felt for a long time, and he doesn\u2019t like it. He knows the technical details of what will happen, but he knows startlingly little about the rest. He\u2019s always suppressed all of it, locked himself away for the night of the rut, and sweated out any urges he\u2019s felt during. He isn\u2019t sure what he\u2019ll actually be like, what Harry will be like, and he hates the unknown. \nHarry\u2019s brows lift in understanding. \u201cOh. No.\u201d Harry touches the back of his hand with his fingertips, just briefly. \u201cIt feels good. Trust me about that,\u201d he adds at Draco\u2019s sceptical look. \n\u201cI just don't want to....\u201d the words \u2018hurt you\u2019 are left unsaid.\n\u201cYou won't,\u201d Harry assures, then laughs once. \u201cHave you ever hurt anyone?\u201d he asks, searching Draco\u2019s face. Draco feels his stomach lurch as he watches the smile slip away from Harry\u2019s face, replaced with a small frown of concern. \n\u201cWhat an incredibly loaded question,\u201d he mumbles around the lump in his throat. He feels Harry\u2019s fingertips return to his hand, a little firmer this time. He\u2019s glad Harry doesn\u2019t refute it though, doesn\u2019t challenge him. Some things, Draco knows, just need to be accepted. Oddly, he feels a little closer to that himself. \n\u201cI should go,\u201d he mumbles again after a minute, flicking his eyes back up to meet Harry\u2019s avid gaze. \n\u201cOkay,\u201d Harry says quietly. \u201cYou\u2019ll be able to Disapparate from here,\u201d he mutters, and Draco nods, watching Harry's mouth. \n\u201cI\u2019ll see you soon,\u201d Draco breathes. \n\u201cYou will.\u201d Harry licks his lips, and Draco inhales again, deeply, feeling suddenly awkward and flushed. He isn't sure how to leave a situation like this, what the etiquette would be. Should he shake his hand, should he offer the address to his Floo, or should he just leave? He stands still, weighing his options up, as Harry watches him with that same intense, slightly heated gaze. \nImpulsively, he leans forwards and kisses Harry\u2019s cheek instead. \nIt\u2019s meant to be quick, intended to be nothing more than a brief peck, but Harry's face is warm, soft, and he makes a soft sound like a sigh as Draco\u2019s lips meet his cheek. Draco inhales again, to try and steady himself, and catches that scent again. Citrus, again, and salt, and something underneath so sweet it makes hims shut his eyes and clench his fist lest he slip his fingers over Harry\u2019s bare wrist. Draco turns his face into Harry\u2019s cheek, pulling back a little, and he can hear rather than see Harry opening his mouth to speak, his fingers brushing the hem of Draco\u2019s shirt. Draco wants to kiss him again, to bury his face in his neck and breathe that scent down until it\u2019s all he can think about, and he opens his mouth, brushes his lips over Harry\u2019s skin once more. \nHe steps back again quickly, clearing his throat and nods at Harry\u2019s dazed expression. \n\u201cI should really go,\u201d he says, and Harry inclines his head in slightly frantic agreement. \n\u201cYou really, really should,\u201d he says with feeling. \u201cBecause I really, really don\u2019t want you to.\u201d\nDraco\u2019s stomach flips, heat blossoming in his chest, over his collarbone and up onto his neck. \u201cSee you in two days, then,\u201d he manages, and it sounds wobbly and breathy even to his own ears. \n\u201cYou will,\u201d Harry says, and it sounds like a promise. \nDraco takes a deep breath, and Disapparates with a soft pop. \nIt's only when he\u2019s home, heating up some leftover supper and resting one shoulder against the wall as he stares absently into the pot, that he realises that that didn\u2019t feel much like a contract negotiation \u2015 it felt an awful lot like a date. Which is\u2026 more than a little confusing. Perhaps that\u2019s how it always felt between Harry and the clients he used to have. Draco frowns, itching his ribs, and then absently trailing his fingers over the slightly raised skin of the bite scar on his side. That doesn\u2019t seem quite right though. \nHe flicks his wand, watches the ladle stir the leek and potato soup, and thinks back on their conversation. The kiss, under the gazebo, and then again when Draco left. It all feels surreal, and incredibly, impossibly, nice. His body is aching already, his limbs a little heavy and tired, and he knows he\u2019ll be feeling wired soon enough. Everything seems brighter, louder, more potent than usual, and he wonders if Harry\u2019s scent has lingered on his clothes, or if it just feels like it\u2019s still around him because he can\u2019t get it out of his head. For the first time, the fact that he hasn't taken the usual cocktail of suppressants doesn\u2019t worry him. \nHe only realises he\u2019s smiling about that when he catches sight of himself in the reflective surface of his kitchen window, and he scrubs a hand over his mouth, trying to wipe the giddy look away. He heads to the dining room to eat, alone. Impulsively, he puts on a record, the soft sounds filling the room for the first time in what feels like months, possibly even years; it's been an age since he\u2019s felt like listening to music. \nWhen he catches his mouth twitching up into a smile again, this time he lets it.\n*\nThey agree that Harry will arrive the evening before his heat is expected.\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clockwork, you know?\u201d he explained via the Floo, earlier in the week. \u201cBut there\u2019s always the chance it\u2019ll come early, and having me in your house, familiar to you, might help when you. You know.\u201d Harry waved a fiery hand at Draco\u2019s general vicinity. \u201cWhen you, uh. Respond to me.\u201d\n\u201cRespond to you?\u201d\n\u201cOkay, when you want to fuck me,\u201d was Harry's reply, heated and playful in equal measure. \u201cThe heat is usually a little earlier than a rut would be, and when it hits. Well. You\u2019ll want to fuck me.\u201d \nHis voice was a little muffled by the flames, but the words went right to Draco\u2019s groin, making him shut his eyes and and turn away. He was useless for the rest of that afternoon, distracted and trying to will his half-hard erection to go away, to no avail. He\u2019d ended up wanking in the kitchen, sliding his hand into his trousers and feeling his cock thicken fully in his fist as he slipped his shaky fist up and down the length of it. He was an average size, he thought, or perhaps a little on the longer end of things, and he ran his fingertips over the moisture collecting at the head, hissed at the feel of it. He pulled his t-shirt up to his armpits, letting his knuckles skate over the ridge of his scar and jerked at the jolt of sensation he felt there. It wasn\u2019t exactly pleasure, but it definitely wasn\u2019t pain, reminding Draco instead of something in between. It made his cock jerk in his fist, his breath hitch, and he ran his fist down to base of his cock, imagined what it might feel like to be buried deep inside Harry, to feel him clench and writhe underneath him and for his cock to thicken further, filling Harry up and \u2015 \nDraco came suddenly, in the middle of the day in his sunlit kitchen, with a strangled groan. He laughed shakily, rinsing his hand under the tap and then spelling away the mess on his floor.\nHe was half-hard again by the time he finished. \nThe day that Harry arrives, Draco tries to keep busy. He wakes up late, the tension in his body feeling like it\u2018s strung even more taut then ever, and his stomach growling. Of all the things he wasn\u2019t expecting, the sudden appetite truly takes him by surprise, as he works his way through a bowl of muesli and then half a loaf of bread. He feel ravenous, and overheated, as if he has a fever, except he doesn't feel ill in the slightest. His body aches a little, as if he\u2019s been for a slightly too long run, but he\u2019s not lethargic. He feels alert, the room around him illuminated a little as he becomes aware of scents he\u2019s never noticed before. The newly turned earth in his garden, the presence of the small ginger tomcat that visits him every now again. Draco can tell what path the cat took, as it tiptoed over his fence and over the fallen autumn leaves from his maple tree, as they litter the grass. He crushes one as he drinks his tea, holds it an arm\u2019s length away from himself and delights in the strange tang as its scent fills the air. It's wonderful, bitter and thick, and Draco isn't sure if he\u2019s only able to pick these things up now that the rut is a day away, or if he\u2019s always been able to and has been suppressing that he suppresses a lot of what he feels. He lets the crumpled leaf fall to the ground, near his bare feet, and wiggles them against the grass. Whatever it is, he can sense it now. \nHe remembers again that Omegas are more sensitive to scents than Alphas, and he suddenly wonders what it\u2019s like for Harry. He\u2019s aware that he can't wait for Harry to arrive, and is hellishly nervous about it at the same time. He\u2019s looking forward to having some company who can relate to how he\u2019s feeling; Pansy and Millicent were fabulously crude and unhelpful when they came around the previous evening, and Blaise was refreshingly uninterested when he Floo\u2019d. Draco hasn't tried to explain to any of them what the barrage to his senses is making him feel, nor who exactly his heat companion is, no matter how much Pansy has tried to cajole him into it. It's silly, he knows, but he likes that he\u2019s excited about seeing Harry, that the memory of the times they\u2019ve met and spoken make him feel warm and nervous, and he doesn't want that to be spoiled by Pansy\u2019s predictably unhappy reaction. He knows this is a contractual agreement, that Harry is providing a service, but it doesn't feel like that to Draco. He isn't sure if it\u2019s wise or incredibly idiotic to foster those feelings, the startling attraction and even budding friendship and affection he feels towards Harry, but he can\u2019t be bothered trying to pretend he doesn't feel it. If it comes back to haunt him then he\u2019ll deal with that when it happens. At the least, he trusts that Harry will let him down gently, and honestly, when it comes to him packing his bags and tearing up the contract. He doesn't want to think about what happens after the heat though, in a rare moment of not indulging in his finely cultivated pessimism. \nHe thinks, instead, back on that kiss in the park, the feel of Harry\u2019s lips against his, the way he\u2019d pressed forwards \u2015 of Harry\u2019s scent. \nDraco leans forwards, swearing lightly as he fists his rapidly swelling cock through his joggers. He rests his other hand on the guest bed he was setting up for Harry in the spare room, fists the light blue sheets between his fingers. Draco hasn't been able to stop thinking of his scent, even impulsively buying limes and creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e when he went to the markets the previous day. It's not the same, not remotely, as he ran his fingers over a vanilla pod, then cracked the burnt sugar top of the creamy dessert last night. It reminds him of the way Harry made him feel, though, and that\u2019s enough at the moment to set him off. \nHe doesn't come as quickly this time. He pulls the soft material of his pants down, until it rests just under his balls, and pulls himself off with long slow strokes. He hits his eyes, a shiver running up his spine to his neck, over his throat as he trails his fingers over it and he pulls his t-shirt over his head, lets it drop carelessly to the floor. He looks down the length of his chest. \nThe scars are faint, thin, even wispy in places. Some of them are barely visible. He\u2019s pale himself, and always has been, and he wonders if they would stand out more if he had a darker complexion. They crisscross his torso, down to his stomach, and he runs one hand over them, lets his fingers stop as he reaches the thicker but no less pale werewolf bite. Again, the jolt of pleasure-pain is startling, another reminder that this is no ordinary scar. The Sectumsempra curse meant that the scars never fully healed, the lingering malevolent magic burned into his skin, and the werewolf bite is again something different. The magic behind that is dark, runs deeper than any curse; it's in his blood, entwined with his own magical core, and will never heal, the damage it caused permanent. He traces the line of it with the tips of his fingers, gasping gently as he moves lower, to the slight jut of his hips. He ups the pace of his fist, moving along the length of his cock in smooth and certain strokes, faster and then faster again, feeling the pleasure build and then peak. He gasps, spreading his knees as wide as he can while trapped in the material of his pants as he comes in warm, wet pulses over his fingers, onto the bedspread beneath him. His head falls forward as he pants, hips rolling and thighs clenching, as he lets the final waves of his orgasm skitter along his nerves. His fingers still stroke his oversensitive cock, his come making his grip slick and almost soothing. \nAfter a moment he sighs, then exhales roughly in a loud puff of air. He shakes his head, then his hair out of his eyes. \n\u201cThis is ridiculous,\u201d he mumbles, standing up and righting his clothes, then Summoning his wand and cleaning the sheets. Merlin\u2019s tits, he\u2019s as bad as a teenager again, he thinks as he moves to peel the sheets away so he can replace them. He can only wonder what it would be like for Harry, given he\u2019ll be on the verge of a heat and likely to be even more susceptible than Draco to the scents around him. He rubs his fingers over the untucked corner, wondering what his scent must be like for Harry, if it would linger in the room. The idea of it sends a thrill down him, and he impulsively retucks the corner of the sheets over the edge of the mattress, stands and leaves before he can think better of it. \nThen, he waits for Harry.\n*\nHarry arrives exactly seven minutes late.\nDraco knows, because he was avidly staring at the clock, unable to think of anything else to do with the nervous, antsy energy running through him. He manages to stop himself from actually standing by the door, but it takes no small effort. He can't remember the last he was this nervous about something, or this excited. \nIt's dark outside, but even before Harry steps in the door Draco can see he\u2019s dressed incredibly casually, in blue jeans with a fraying rip in the knee, a black t-shirt and an unzipped hoodie. He\u2019s wearing those familiar wire lenses, his face a little pale underneath them, and when he lifts them off his eyes Draco can see that they're even brighter than the last time he saw them, shining with what at any other time Draco would assume was a fever. He\u2019s also carrying a duffel bag, and the sight of it makes Draco\u2019s pulse quicken. He isn't sure why, but the battered overnight bag precariously balanced on Harry\u2019s shoulder makes it seem real, inevitable. \nThey stand at the open doorway for a long time, Draco barefoot against the cold floorboards, and Harry\u2019s cheeks slowly blush a faint pink. \n\u201cHello, Harry,\u201d Draco makes himself say, trying to remember his manners, along with how to function like a reasonable human being. It's hard when he can't stop staring at Harry\u2019s cheeks, at the line of his collarbone just visible above his t-shirt neck.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Harry croaks, clearing his throat. He inhales softly, then frowns, making a small sound. Draco can barely hear around the thud of his heartbeat, and he quickly steps aside and waves Harry in. He takes a steadying breath, trying to clear his head, and then groans as he\u2019s suddenly hit by Harry\u2019s scent. \nIt's the same as before, only brighter somehow, louder, and Draco shuts his eyes, feels his knees almost buckle with it. He concentrates on breathing steadily as he waits for his mind to clear, for his reaction to dull. He moves one hand to his stomach, spreads his fingers wide against the soft material of his t-shirt. It helps, somehow, to ground him and he slowly opens his eyes, braced for Harry to surely be watching him like he\u2019s completely lost his mind. He\u2019s not prepared for what he does see. \nWhatever Harry\u2019s looking at him with, it's not disdain, or amusement, at Draco\u2019s brief lapse in control. He\u2019s barely moved from the doorway, standing just opposite Draco, and his bag has slipped from his shoulder to his elbow, pulling his t-shirt aside and revealing the line of his shoulder, and then the ridged edge of a healed yet jagged white scar. Draco doesn't even know how to categorise the rush of emotion \u2015 protective, angry, aroused, protective \u2015 he feels at the sight of that. \n\u201cChrist,\u201d Draco mutters vehemently, and Harry groans, then nods. \n\u201cYeah. You smell\u2026\u201d He tilts his head back against the wall with a soft thud, then visibly shakes himself. \u201cFuck.\u201d \n\u201cIs this\u2026\u201d Draco starts, pushing his hair up and away from his face. \u201cAre you \u2015\u201d \nHarry grunts, then puffs his cheeks out, eyes still closed. \n\u201cNope. Just,\u201d he waves a hand then laughs. It sounds somewhat incredulous. \u201cYou smell fucking incredible.\u201d\nDraco reaches out, touches the hallway wall. It's cold against his fingers, and he leans his weight against it, willing his erection down. \n\u201cSo this is just\u2026us,\u201d Draco tries, \u201cbeing ridiculous in the fucking hallway?\u201d he finishes with deep conviction. He certainly feels like an overstimulated prat. He drags his eyes away from Harry\u2019s throat. \n\u201cYeah.\u201d Harry laughs, finally opening his eyes as he leans forwards. He nods, then scrubs his hand over his face, almost swaying a little bit. \n\u201cRight.\u201d He shakes himself briskly again. \u201cI'm good. We\u2019re fine.\u201d He jangles his arm, the bag on it making a heavy sound. \u201cWhere can I\u2026 Can I put this somewhere?\u201d \n\u201cOh, yes of course. Sorry.\u201d Draco starts down the hallway, thankful he put on a loose-ish pair of trousers; they conceal his half-hard cock well, although he does walk a little stiffly.\nHe stops at the spare bedroom, then clears his throat. He gestures for Harry to enter. \n\u201cPlease, make yourself at home.\u201d \n\u201cIs this your guest room?\u201d \n\u201cYes, I. Well, I wasn't sure if\u2026 if you would sleep here, or in the master, with me.\u201d Draco can feel himself turning red, and he lingers in the doorway then finally steps into the room after Harry. \u201cSo. I set it up for you anyway.\u201d He clears his throat. \nHarry carefully drops his bag on the chair by the small window. \u201cThis is nice,\u201d he mumbles distractedly, flicking Draco a gaze and then peeling his hooded jumper off. \u201cThank you.\u201d \nDraco looks away, adjusts a book on the shelf to his left to stop himself from staring at Harry\u2019s exposed arms, at the brief flash of his stomach when he peeled his hoodie off. \n\u201cDo you sleep in here?\u201d he asks breathily and Draco frowns as he considers the question. Before he can answer, Harry\u2019s shaking his head, breathing out roughly. \u201cStupid question. Course you don\u2019t.\u201d \n\u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d Draco folds his arms over his chest. \n\u201cAh.\u201d Another shaky laugh from Harry. \u201cScents\u2019 just. It's strong in here.\u201d There's a small frown between his brows, as he rubs his hand over his mouth and then up into his hair. It's neater than usual, at least it was until Harry distractedly teases his fingers through it. \n\u201cMy scent \u2015 oh.\u201d Draco isn't sure what Harry means, until suddenly he is; the room would be filled with Draco\u2019s scent, his earlier indiscretion cleaned away but not so much that Harry won\u2019t be able to tell. \n\u201cIs that a problem?\u201d he inquires, as evenly as he can around the strange rush of emotion inside him. It's not embarrassment, as he thought it might be, nor humiliation. He can't think of a word for it, but pride might cover it, which is startling enough. He feels an odd sense of proprietary pleasure in knowing Harry can still sense his presence among the sheets, and his prick begins to harden once more. \n\u201cNo.\u201d Harry rubs one palm over his jeans, and Draco stares at his eyes, refusing to track the movement of his hands. Refusing to look down. \u201cNo, it's not a problem,\u201d he says in a hushed tone. \nHis hair is sticking up a little from where Harry was careless with his fingers, his lower lip reddened from being worried by his teeth. Draco wants to kiss him, to run his lips over his jaw. The desire is at once stark, urgent, and moderated at the same time. His head swims with it, like the rush that comes from holding his breath too long, and it leaves as quickly as it comes. He sucks his own lip into his mouth instead, delights in the way Harry watches him do it. He\u2019s never seen someone mirror his own arousal like this, so plainly and so in sync with what he\u2019s feeling himself. There\u2019s a tug of war between them, a rope that\u2019s ready to snap tight, and Draco knows that he could tip the balance now. He could pull Harry to him, kiss him soft and then hard, take him in here like he fantasised about earlier. His body is thrumming with the desire to do it, the sentiments echoed by Harry\u2019s tight posture, by his avid and hungry gaze. But Draco also knows he can wait, that it will happen between them, and happen soon. He doesn't need to tip the balance at all; it's tipping on its own, with a gentle inevitability. Draco knows that he can wait. \nHe feels almost dizzy with the feeling of power it brings him. And then again, as he watches Harry gaze turn heated once more. \n\u201cWhat's my scent like?\u201d he suddenly asks, stepping closer to Harry. Harry sighs, staring at Draco\u2019s mouth. \n\u201cYour scent,\u201d he repeats, looking away. He rubs the back of one knuckle over his cheek. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Like a lot of things, familiar things, but not like them at all at the same time. I don't know how to describe it.\u201d \n\u201cTry.\u201d\n\u201cAll right.\u201d Harry fixes him with a piercing gaze. \u201cYou smell like sex.\u201d \nDraco inhales sharply, licks his lips as Harry now takes a step forward. They\u2019re standing almost toe to toe, Harry\u2019s trainers nearly touching Draco\u2019s bare feet. \n\u201cYour scent is like mint, like wood.\u201d Harry\u2019s voice is low, a shock of dark hair falling over his glasses. Draco\u2019s fingers itch to touch it. \u201cLike rain when it hits warm concrete. But mostly.\u201d Harry draws in a shuddering breath, then shuffles backwards. He brushes that hair away from his face, and Draco lets his fingers relax. \u201cMostly you just smell like sex to me.\u201d Harry turns and starts to unzip his duffel bag. \u201cWhich is\u2026\u201d \n\u201cIncredible, and driving you mad?\u201d Draco suggests, after Harry doesn't finish. \n\u201cGod, yes.\u201d Harry straightens. He pulls a pair of joggers from his duffel, then a soft white t-shirt. Draco can smell the laundry detergent on it. He weighs them slightly in his hands, lips twisted in thought. \u201cI\u2019ve missed this, you know.\u201d \n\u201cThis?\u201d \n\u201cTalking to someone. About how this\u2026\u201d He folds one corner of his shirt down, then flips it back. \u201cHow it feels. Right before it happens.\u201d\nDraco tilts his head to the side. He toys with a cushion at the end of the bed, then sighs, throws it up towards the headboard. \u201cThis is all a bit new for me.\u201d He focusses on how much he likes talking about this, instead of the jealousy he feels at the idea of Harry being with other people. He forces the unwelcome feeling away, smiles at Harry. His expression turns quizzical when he sees Harry regarding him now with a strange look. Open, maybe, even more so than usual, and perhaps a little vulnerable. \n\u201cThis feels a bit new to me as well, to be honest.\u201d Harry licks his lips, Adam\u2019s apple bobbing as he swallows. Draco\u2019s smile softens, even as the whirring feeling inside his chest quickens. He tries to think of something to say, a way to ask what exactly that means, but he stops himself. Instead, he flexes his fingers then reaches forward and brushes that errant curl of Harry\u2019s away from his glasses. He tucks it behind Harry\u2019s ear, lets his fingers trail over Harry\u2019s cheek. He doesn\u2019t imagine the way Harry turns his face into the touch as Draco draws his hand away. \n\u201cI\u2019ll leave you to unpack,\u201d Draco says quietly as Harry nods. \u201cThe bathroom is through there.\u201d He points to the door directly to Harry\u2019s left. \u201cIt adjoins this room, and my bedroom is on the other side.\u201d he crosses his arms over his chest again. \u201cThere are towels, toiletries. I imagine you brought your own, but nevertheless. Make wildly liberal use of whatever you want to while you\u2019re here.\u201d\nHarry laughs. \u201cWildly liberal use of your toothpaste?\u201d\n\u201cIf you must.\u201d One corner of Draco\u2019s mouth tilts up. \u201cYes.\u201d\nHarry laughs again, much softer. \u201cI do need to take a few potions.\u201d He makes a face at Draco\u2019s confused frown. \u201cThey\u2019ll take about four hours to kick in, and I\u2019m not due until the morning, but. Better safe than sorry, if anything happens in the night.\u201d He puffs a laugh, but Draco only shakes his head, his hair tickling at his cheeks. \n\u201cSorry, I\u2019m not following entirely. Is it\u2026 For the heat?\u201d\nHarry looks at him sideways. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says slowly. \u201cFor\u2026 Well. For the obvious.\u201d\nDraco raises both brows. Whatever Harry\u2019s referring to, it\u2019s not obvious to him. The usual potions he took for his ruts involved a mild sedative, a pheromone and hormone suppressant, another which helped with fertili \u2015 \n\u201cOh,\u201d Draco mumbles, rubbing his palm over his chin as Harry\u2019s meaning dawns on him. \u201cYou mean contraceptives.\u201d He breathes, suddenly feeling overwhelmingly hot. \n\u201cDid that not occur to you?\u201d Harry says kindly, tilting his head forwards to try and better gauge Draco\u2019s expression. \n\u201cNot,\u201d Draco clears his throat, fiddles with the neck of his t-shirt, \u201cOnly in the abstract.\u201d He feels his face growing even hotter, his neck and collarbone flushing too. He isn\u2019t quite sure why he\u2019s reacting like this, but he\u2019s somehow not really connected the idea of Harry and fertility before now. It\u2019s silly of him; it\u2019s the purpose of the heat. The Healer\u2019s words ring through his head. \u201cYour body wants to mate, Draco.\u201d Of all the things Draco has never had even the vaguest interest in, it\u2019s always been that at the top of the list. He\u2019s stunned, now, by the wave of emotion surging inside him. Mating, fertility, conception. He swallows, looking away. He knows he\u2019s gone right past pink and flushed a deep crimson. \n\u201cDraco.\u201d\n\u201cGive me a minute,\u201d Draco croaks, eyes fixed determinedly at the wall. He\u2019s going to ride this weird reaction out.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Harry says softly. \u201cShould I perhaps give you some space?\u201d\n\u201cThis is your room.\u201d Draco\u2019s pleased to hear his voice has returned to a slightly more normal timbre. He suspects his hands are still shaking, though. He shakes them out, risks a look at Harry. \n\u201cGod,\u201d Draco looks away from the confused and concerned warmth in Harry\u2019s gaze. \u201cMy apologies. I think I should.\u201d He tucks his hands into his pockets. \u201cI should leave you to settle in,\u201d he utters. \n\u201cAll right.\u201d Harry coughs into his fist to clear his throat. \n\u201cI\u2019ll probably try and get a bit of sleep,\u201d Draco says, slightly redundantly. It\u2019s ten pm; he\u2019s usually sound asleep by now.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Harry tilts his head from side to side, cracking his neck. \u201cI\u2019ll aim to sleep for a bit, too. Before\u2026.\u201d He puffs his cheeks out, mimes an explosion with his hands. The gesture is childish, and overdone, and Draco laughs, a little too loud and far too genuine. Harry grins at him, looking relieved to hear Draco\u2019s laugh. \n\u201cNight, Draco.\u201d He looks relieved, tired, a little unsteady on his feet, and impossibly, breathtakingly handsome, and Draco wants to kiss him again. He thinks he probably can, but he knows he\u2019d have trouble stopping, so he lifts two fingers in a wave instead. \n\u201cGood night, Harry,\u201d he says instead. \nHe walks through the adjoining bathroom to his own bedroom.\n*\n*\nDraco is in the potions classroom.\nThe room is dark, dimly lit, and his classmates sit around him, focussing on their slowly heating cauldrons. \nHarry is sitting on the desk in front of him. He swings his bare feet, his heel hitting the table leg with a rhythmic thump. He\u2019s smiling, his red and gold tie undone and his shirt rolled up to reveal his forearms. Draco can\u2019t make sense of it. Potter never smiles at him. \nDraco doesn\u2019t understand what he\u2019s doing here. \nThe room is hot, stifling. His shirt feels like it's smothering him, the air thick and cloying. No one else seems to have noticed though, to be bothered by it. Sweat trickles down Draco\u2019s spine, his armpits, dampening his shirt. His trousers feel too tight, and he glances down briefly, then away again in embarrassment. He thinks he\u2019s getting hard, and he hopes no one has noticed. But then again, why would they, considering they also haven't noticed how fucking hot it is in here. And why has Snape not told Potter to get off of Draco\u2019s desk? Draco purses his lips.\n\u201cSir, he\u2019s \u2015\u201d \n\u201cIt's all right, Draco,\u201d Snape drawls, turning a page of his book. He doesn\u2019t look up. \u201cHe didn't do it on purpose.\u201d\n\u201cWhat \u2015\u201d \n\u201cSuperficial wounds heal easily.\u201d Snick. Another turn of the page. \u201cBut Dark Magic leaves its mark.\u201d\nDraco glowers down at his lap. He isn\u2019t sure what that means, but it sounds familiar. He wants to ask Snape more, to shove at Harry\u2019s knee, but he frowns as something brushes against his calf. Draco sits up straighter. \nIt brushes over his calf again. \nIt\u2019s soft, furred. Draco\u2019s skin prickles. Danger. He swallows around the lump of fear, listens for the faint clack of teeth. He feels it again, the brush of a warm pelt, of bristled fur against his legs, and then the heave of a large animal as it rests near his feet. He hears its jaw click as it yawns, feels its wet nose bump against his hand. Danger, he thinks again but it's different. He feels the rough lick of a smooth tongue over his fingertips. There's no danger here. Draco curls his toes against the wolf\u2019s soft pelt. \nHe looks back up at Harry. \nThump. Harry\u2019s heel hits the wood. Thump. Thump. \nThump. \n\u201cPotter, why are you being so weird?\u201d he hisses, but Harry's smile doesn't waver. The hair on Draco's skin standing on end, and he shivers as a trickle of sweat runs down his spine.\n\u201cWake up,\u201d Harry silently mouths, and Draco frowns. He is awake, already, he\u2019s awake and in class. He\u2019s not meant to be here though, he\u2019s meant to be in the Room. He\u2019s meant to be in the Room, repairing the cabinet, not here with Harry bloody Potter sitting on his desk. Harry who is smiling at him, and how can he even see Draco without his glasses? \n\u201cBennetts street, boy,\u201d Snape says in a bored tone. \u201cDo pay attention. Fifteen points from Slytherin.\u201d\n\u201cWake up, Draco.\u201d \nHarry's teeth are visible as his smile widens, pointed canines bumping against his full lower lip. Draco curls his toes again at the sight, frowning harder. He tightens his hands against his thighs, then presses his legs together. He can feel his erection growing. He can feel the wolf stirring. \nHe can feel the room getting hotter. \nWake up, now.\nDraco lurches upright with a start. \nThe room is dark, and silent, except for the shuddering sound of his breathing, and it takes him a moment to remember where he is. He blinks in the darkness, letting his eyes adjust, and easily makes out the scant furniture of his room, the shape of his wardrobe and mahogany dresser. He sits forward, hunching forward and holding his stomach. It rolls again, strange and queasy, but he doesn\u2019t feel sick. He feels hot, intensely so, and out of breath like he\u2019s run a marathon, had a nightmare. He hasn't though, he thinks, half-remembering the strangeness of his dream. It\u2019s not even close to the weirdest thing that\u2019s ever popped into his head during the night, and it wasn\u2019t remotely frightening. He gasps again, as he remembers Harry\u2019s persistent, fond smile and the strangely alluring smells of the cauldron fumes. An odd spike of sensation runs up his side. \n\u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d he mutters, desperately untangling his legs from the wreck of his sheets. He kicks them away, growling in frustration when his heel catches on a corner before he manages to finally fling them away from his body and onto the ground. He rests his head back, staring at the ceiling as he waits for the dizziness, the disorienting buzzing feeling in his head, to subside, but it doesn't. He scrubs a hand through his hair, then tries to smooth it down. It\u2019s messy, tangled, the usually neat strands damp at his nape and he suddenly realises he\u2019s covered in sweat. His skin is tacky with it, his t-shirt cloying and clinging to him uncomfortably, and he pulls it over his head. It catches on his ears and he grunts again in annoyance, then in relief when he manages to pull the material free. He bunches the t-shirt up, runs it over his body, then shivers as he feels the cool air of the room meet his overheated skin. He gasps when the material brushes over the bite scar on his side, his cock jumping. He drops the t-shirt, leaning forwards as he rides the surge of pleasure to its plateau, waits for it to ebb away again like it has previously in the last few days. \nAgain, it doesn't. \n\u201cShit,\u201d Draco mumbles, stilling as he properly makes sense of what\u2019s happening. He runs his fingers over his ribs, down the jagged expanse of the bite scar. He closes his eyes, bites his lip. \u201cShit,\u201d he repeats emphatically as another overheated shiver runs over his prickling skin.\nThe dream woke him up, but now Draco knows it's more. His mouth falls open on a sigh, twisting into a low and strangled groan. The scar on his side throbs, deep and insistent, and his heart is beating a steady rhythm inside his chest. His cock aches, his head spinning, and when he inhales deeply he catches it. Scent. \nOmega. \n\u201cFuck, fuck, fuck,\u201d Draco mumbles frantically, as he staggers upright from the bed. It takes him two tries, and he has to press his hand to his bedroom wall, swaying a little on the spot as he breathes heavily. He needs water, he thinks desperately, to cool down, to get a grip. He rubs his hand over his face, over the stubble at his jaw. He knew this was coming, knew this was going to happen. He\u2019s still somehow not prepared for it, though, wasn\u2019t entirely braced for the reality of what\u2019s happening to him now, unhindered by potions and running rampant through his system. It\u2019s stupid, he tells himself, but even though it feels good, exciting, it\u2019s riddling him with anxiety. He wants to wake Harry up, he thinks, to ask him about it \u2015 to ask what he\u2019s supposed to do, how he should act, what happens from here. Harry will know, he thinks, as he heads towards the door to the adjoining bathroom.\nIt\u2019s difficult to walk with his erection thick and heavy between his legs, and he laughs thickly, unhappily, at how ridiculous this all is, at the sight he must make. He wants to go back to bed, to pull the covers over his head and lock the door until the feeling goes away, but he doesn\u2019t let himself. Harry, he thinks frantically, just bloody go and get Harry. He feels his skin prickle pleasantly at the thought, his cock jumping, and he grips the door handle, trying not to think too much about how much of an idiot he\u2019s going to make of himself, waking Harry up at 1am with an erection and a cold sweat. He makes himself twist the door handle, easing it open. \nHe isn\u2019t expecting Harry to be already up and waiting for him, on the other side of the door. \nDraco opens his mouth to speak, to say something, but he can\u2019t manage it around the dual waves of immense relief he feels at seeing Harry, and the frightening spike of arousal at being in his presence that follows. Harry is shirtless, his hair damp and pushed back as if he\u2019s wet it, pushed it back from his forehead with his fingers, more than once. It sticks up in awkwardly tangled waves, and he\u2019s left his glasses by the bathroom sink. There\u2019s a little mark on either side of his nose where they would usually sit, both slightly whiter than the rest of his face, which is flushed and ruddy. His posture is tense, his fingers clenching and unclenching at the material of his grey joggers and his breathing shallow. He\u2019s standing close enough to Draco to touch, evidently having been waiting on the other side of the door. His eyes are even more startling than before, somehow unfocussed and yet focussed intently on Draco at the same time, and Draco forces himself to look away, down the length of Harry\u2019s body. He tries to remember what he was going to ask, but his cock twiches, his neck and chest flushing with heat as he see the trail of dark hair leading from Harry\u2019s navel into the line of his joggers. Draco can see the shape of his erection there, and he inhales sharply, eyelids fluttering as he shakes his head to try and clear it. He looks away, eyes drawn to the pale line of the scar on Harry\u2019s shoulder, so different to the one on his forehead. It\u2019s not as big as he thought it would be, not as pronounced as Draco\u2019s own, and he shivers at the sight of it. His skin prickles again with that strange and proprietary longing. His cock throbs. \nDraco groans, then claps his hand over his mouth, muffling the sound, but it\u2019s too late. He sees Harry\u2019s brows furrow, one shoulder lifting as he worries his lower lip and runs a sweaty palm over his the thigh of his joggers as he stares at Draco\u2019s chest. He clutches the material in his fist. \n\u201cDraco,\u201d Harry starts, then stops. He opens his mouth, makes a sort of vague gesture with one shaking hand, then gives up and drops his head to Draco\u2019s shoulder with a groan. \n\u201cThank fuck you\u2019re awake,\u201d he says emphatically into Draco\u2019s skin, leaning almost his entire weight on him as he inhales deeply. Draco grips the doorframe, trying to keep them both upright. He clenches the fingers of his other hand, not sure what to do with them \n\u201cYou were waiting?\u201d he whispers, not trusting himself to speak any louder. He doesn't want to hear the way his voice cracks, can\u2019t imagine what it would be like if he aimed for a normal tone. Harry nods, hair tickling at Draco\u2019s jaw, and Draco swallows down the breathy sound he almost makes. \n\u201cHow long?\u201d\nHarry shrugs noncommittally, his shoulders tight. \u201cDunno. Hour. Maybe longer. Haven\u2019t\u2026 Couldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d \n\u201cFuck,\u201d Draco mumbles, slipping an arm around Harry\u2019s waist. He moans again through tightly pressed lips as his fingers brush over Harry\u2019s hot skin, and he feels Harry\u2019s shiver, his breath warm against his shoulder. Harry turns his face into Draco\u2019s neck. \n\u201c\u2018S waiting for you to wake up,\u201d he mumbles feverishly, and Draco moans again, this time open mouthed and loud.\n\u201cYou could have woken me up,\u201d he mutters, running his fingers over Harry\u2019s spine, turning his own face towards Harry\u2019s hair. He brushes his lips over it, presses the heel of his other palm against the doorframe. He feels Harry's lips move against his skin as he speaks. \n\u201cWould\u2019ve been rude,\u201d he answers, and Draco huffs a laugh. The sound is sudden, loud, echoing through the quiet bathroom.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry asks, raising his head from Draco\u2019s shoulder. His cheeks are red, the pulse point in his neck fluttering as his chest rises and falls rapidly with the pace of his breathing. His brows are furrowed in confusion, his expression open and heated. Draco shakes his head again, presses his fingers more firmly against Harry\u2019s back. \n\u201cI was coming in here to wake you up,\u201d he explains softly. Harry\u2019s breathes out in understanding. \n\u201cBecause you have no manners,\u201d he says playfully, his voice thick and low, referring to their conversation from a few days ago. Draco groans again, warmth and fondness running through him, and he pulls Harry closer to him before he even really realises what he\u2019s doing. Harry steps forward easily, sighs shakily when his chest touches Draco\u2019s. \n\u201cGod.\u201d He moves his own hands around Draco\u2019s waist, tries to angle his hips away, to stop his erection from touching Draco\u2019s thigh. \u201cYou smell so good,\u201d he moans. \n\u201cHarry.\u201d Draco inhales deeply, shakily. \u201cWhat do we do from here?\u201d he asks. His voice is shaking, some of his anxiety having ebbed away after being simply in the same room as Harry. Harry moans against his skin. \n\u201cWhat do I do, Harry?\u201d he asks again, more insistently, and Harry groans. He kisses Draco\u2019s throat. \n\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d he says breathily, lips moving again as he kisses up to Draco\u2019s jaw. \n\u201cI, god,\u201d Draco feels Harry\u2019s hands at his hips, pushing him backwards, and Draco lets him. He lets his hand fall away from the doorframe. \u201cI want you to tell me what to do.\u201d He tilts his head to the side, mouth parting as Harry pulls his earlobe between his teeth, then sucks on it gently. \u201cTell me what you want me to do,\u201d he grinds out as he feels Harry\u2019s erection press against his hips. \n\u201cWhat I want,\u201d Harry repeats absently, his voice low and almost distant as he moves one hand to Draco\u2019s neck, kisses distractedly at it again. \u201cWhat do I want?\u201d he asks, pulling back to search Draco\u2019s expression, then kiss at the corner of his mouth. \n\u201cYou tell me,\u201d Draco replies. Harry\u2019s hands paw at his waist, slipping under the hem of his pyjama bottom as he grinds himself against Draco\u2019s thigh, and Draco tightens the arm around Harry\u2019s middle. He can smell it, he realises, smell Harry\u2019s escalating arousal, as easily as he can see the vacant expression creeping into Harry\u2019s eyes, the way his body shivers and trembles against his as he rolls his hips against Harry\u2019s legs. \u201cYou tell me what you want, Harry,\u201d he insists . \n\u201cI don\u2019t, ah, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Harry rolls his hips again, shaking his head as he tries to concentrate, he rubs at one eye. \u201cJust, touch me?\u201d he says, looking at Draco imploringly. He kisses over Draco\u2019s neck again, insistently walking him backwards towards his bed. Draco cards his fingers into Harry\u2019s hair, tilts his head back slightly. He licks his lips, then brushes them over Harry's mouth, the rush of blood loud in his ears. \n\u201cAnything else?\u201d he whispers, feels Harry sigh into his mouth. He shakes his head frantically, lips moving in a light kiss as he mouths the word \u2018no\u2019 against Draco\u2019s mouth. \u201cJust touch you?\u201d Draco repeats hoarsely, pulling back when Harry tries to deepen the kiss. Harry moans, more urgently than before. \n\u201cYeah. Touch me.\u201d He rolls his hips again as Draco stops, his legs hitting the side of the bed. \u201cPlease?\u201d \n\u201cGod.\u201d\n\u201cPlease?\u201d \nDraco sits down, adjusts himself in his pyjama bottoms and keeps his other hand on Harry\u2019s thigh to keep him standing. He kisses over Harry\u2019s stomach, his ribs, massaging his own cock through the thin material. He groans as he slips his fingers below his waistband, then grips himself. His cock feels like a hot brand against his palm, and he tightens his fingers when he hears Harry moan above him. \n\u201cAh.\u201d Harry leans over him slightly, fingers tangled in Draco\u2019s hair. \u201cGod, yes, that.\u201d\n\u201cHarry,\u201d he whispers, fingers gentle, shaking, as he traces them over the line of Harry\u2019s erection through his joggers. Harry makes another whimper-moan of frustration, hips rolling forwards against the air. His body jerks when Draco gently rubs his palm over his cock, presses the heel of his hand against it. \n\u201cOh, fuck,\u201d Harry gasps, and Draco does it again. \n\u201cHarry.\u201d He rests his forehead against Harry\u2019s stomach. \n\u201cFuck.\u201d Harry gasps again. \u201cDraco,\u201d he chokes out. \u201cI need you to, please, can you \u2015\u201d \n\u201cThis?\u201d \nHarry nods his head frantically, his voice high and breathy as Draco moves his hands up to cup his arse. He fits his palms around the rounded globes of it, feels Harry push back against them. \n\u201cI want you,\u201d he rumbles, kissing the line of his abdomen again. He moves his hand, gently parting Harry\u2019s cheeks. His cock throbs against his joggers, and he aches to feel Harry\u2019s skin against his. \n\u201cGod.\u201d Harry\u2019s voice shakes, ends on a groan as he drops his head down, cants his hips forwards. \u201cYes.\u201d \nDraco takes a steadying breath. \u201cCan I \u2015\u201d \n\u201cYes.\u201d \nDraco eases Harry\u2019s joggers down. \nHarry\u2019s skin is smooth and feverishly hot, as Draco runs his hands over it, rests the waist of Harry\u2019s joggers just against the top of his thighs, exposing his cock and arse. He kisses the base of Harry\u2019s stomach, then his hip. He hears Harry moan as he does it again, and Draco curls his toes, rolls his own hips up against nothing as he grips Harry\u2019s arse cheek. He moans again, guttural and loud, as his hands run over the bare skin. Draco can feel his thighs trembling, can barely think around the overwhelming wave after wave of the scent that fills the air. It curls around him, fills his senses, and he feels Harry shiver as Draco kisses, open-mouthed, at the base of his cock. \n\u201cAh!\u201d Harry moans again, little mewls of sound as his hips roll forward, searching for friction, for more contact, against his cock. \u201cFuck, I need,\u201d Harry spreads his legs wider, stretching the material taut as he pushes his arse back against Draco\u2019s hands, his prick bumping against Draco\u2019s chin. \u201cI need, Draco please.\u201d \n\u201cMmm.\u201d Draco moves his hands again, still kneading at Harry\u2019s arse. \u201cYou want me,\u201d he mumbles incredulously into Harry\u2019s skin, and Harry cants his hips again, fingers tight in Draco\u2019s hair. \n\u201cSo much,\u201d Harry moans, \u201cso fucking much.\u201d He\u2019s breathing as if he\u2019s in pain, fast and loud, and Draco blinks the hair out of his eyes, shaking his head as if in disbelief. He kisses Harry\u2019s stomach again, then the base of his cock, runs his lips over the trail of hair low on Harry\u2019s belly, inhales the scent there and groans so loudly he\u2019d be embarrassed if it was with anyone else, in any other scenario. He returns his hands to Harry\u2019s arse, spreads Harry wider still, panting himself now, and feels the glistening slick there as he moves the index fingers of both hands to Harry\u2019s hole. \n\u201cDraco.\u201d\n\u201cFuck,\u201d Draco groans, low and guttural, swaying forwards before he even really registers he\u2019s doing it, he licks a long stripe over the tip of Harry\u2019s cock. He does it again, listening ecstatically as Harry almost shouts with relief, as he sucks the head of Harry\u2019s cock into his mouth. This close the scent is overwhelming, maddening, on his tongue, his lips, and he swirls his tongue around the slit of Harry\u2019s cock. He does it again, moaning almost uncontrollably. He can feel Harry\u2019s skin trembling, the muscles of his thighs trembling as he fights to keep still, his hips twitching back and forth. He\u2019s trying not to thrust, not to push his cock further into Draco\u2019s mouth, while at the same time trying to shift Draco\u2019s fingers inside him, and Draco inhales his scent again, feels Harry\u2019s fingers pull on his hair. He pulls back, lips resting on Harry\u2019s cock as he swirls his tongue again, runs the tip of one finger over his hole. Wet, he thinks dizzily, Harry is so wet. His hole contracts against Draco\u2019s finger, and Harry gasps again, high-pitched and loud, when Draco slips his index finger inside then flicks his gaze up to look at him. \n\u201cOh god, fuck.\u201d Harry draws in a breath, pushing his tangled and sweaty hair away from his face. \u201cFuck, can you \u2015ah!\u201d He groans as Draco twists his finger, moves it deeper. He kisses down the length of Harry\u2019s cock, open mouthed and wet, as he withdraws his finger. He rolls the slick on it between forefinger and thumb, feels another wave of arousal over him, then pushed two fingers back inside Harry. \n\u201cGood,\u201d he mumbles against Harry\u2019s cock, pulling his joggers down lower with his other hand. \u201cThis is good?\u201d\n\u201cYe \u2015 ah, god, yes.\u201d \nDraco pulls his fingers out, then presses them back inside in a slow, deep glide. They slide in so easy \u2015 so good and right \u2015 and he bites his lip, fucking them into Harry slowly at first and then faster, deeper. Harry\u2019s body is shaking, thighs tense as he raises his weight onto the balls of his feet, moves his hands to Draco\u2019s shoulders. He\u2019s bent almost double over Draco, nails digging into Draco\u2019s skin as he gasps a near constant stream of breath sounds, high-pitched and desperate. Draco moves his fingers faster, feels the slick run down his fingers, over his knuckles. He moves his other hand to the back of Harry\u2019s thigh, can feel the wetness there too, and he leans forwards, moves his mouth back to Harry\u2019s pelvis. Draco kisses the base of his cock again, rubs his overheated cheek over it. He groans at the way Harry shivers at that, then rests his forehead against Harry\u2019s quivering belly, feels the muscles of Harry\u2019s stomach jump as he moves his fingers faster, feels Harry buck against him. \n\u201cDraco, can, ah,\u201d Harry\u2019s knees buckle slightly, and Draco grits his teeth, wraps one arm around Harry\u2019s leg. \n\u201cWhat,\u201d he asks, rubbing his forehead over Harry\u2019s skin. \u201cTell me.\u201d\n\u201cMore,\u201d Harry gasps, fingernails leaving dents in Draco\u2019s shoulders. \u201cMore, please, anyth \u2015 oh, fuck, fuck.\u201d \nDraco feels almost dizzy with the rush of warmth and arousal running through him as he pulls his fingers back, then adds a third. He closes his eyes and twists them, groaning as Harry makes another low, guttural moan. It sounds half like relief, like frustration, as Harry moves his hips back and forth, forcing Draco\u2019s fingers in deeper and searching for contact against his leaking cock. Draco slides his tongue along the length of it, moves back and brushes his lips over the head. The salty taste is sharp on his tongue as he grips Harry\u2019s cock with his other hand, moves his fingers down it in a long, slow stroke. \n\u201cFuck,\u201d he whispers hoarsely, \u201clisten to you,\u201d he chokes out roughly. He moves his fist faster up the length of Harry\u2019s cock, listens to his breathing growing louder and louder still. \nHis own cock is heavy and aching, full, and he\u2019s desperate for relief, but more than that he feels dizzy with want, with need, to feel Harry come. The scent is filling the room, setting Draco\u2019s nerves on fire \u2015 he can feel Harry\u2019s escalating arousal, in his body and in the changing pulse of his scent. His slick is on his fingers, his knuckles, and Harry clenches around his fingers, trying to draw them deeper, push back against them. The sound of his fingers as they move inside Harry is loud, wet and maddening, and Draco groans, moving his other hand faster over Harry\u2019s cock. He swipes his thumb over the head, fist moving in swift movements as he gasps against Harry\u2019s skin, forehead brushing over the wiry curls at the base of Harry\u2019s cock.\n\u201cFuck, you can, ah.\u201d Draco pulls back, licks at the head of Harry\u2019s cock again. \u201cCome, Harry,\u201d he groans frantically, \u201cyou can come.\u201d\n\u201cUh!\u201d\n\u201cI want you to come.\u201d Draco looks up at Harry desperately through his fringe, his own hips pushing up against nothing, as Harry stares back down at him, wide-eyed and open mouthed. \u201cI want you to come, now, on m \u2015 me, fuck.\u201d He breaks off on a groan, huffing a shocked laugh. His fingers are aching, the angle awkward as he pumps them inside Harry, and he\u2019s surprised by his own words even as he moves his hand faster over Harry's cock, as he realises how true it is. He wants Harry to come, so badly he feels on fire with it, wants to feel it, to hear him, to have that scent fill the room. It\u2019s all he can think about, the needs of his own aching cock taking a backseat to the sudden and urgent desire to make Harry feel good, to feel his scent around him, on him. He tightens his fist, straightening his shoulders as he feels Harry clench around him one last time before he comes with a shout. \n\u201cYes,\u201d Draco hisses, as Harry\u2019s cock spurts warm and wet against Draco's chest, his collarbone and neck. Harry gasps, high-pitched and loud as Draco\u2019s fingers continue to work him over, and Draco moans as Harry pulses again, and again. His back is prickling with sweat, his hands aching and his cock hard and leaking a damp patch onto the front of his pyjama bottoms and he can feel Harry\u2019s scent over him as Harry\u2019s cock spurts one last time, against Draco\u2019s throat and chin. \n\u201cFuck,\u201d Draco moans. He moves his wet fist down the length of Harry\u2019s still hard cock, before he releases it. Harry whimpers, fingers digging hard into Draco\u2019s shoulders as he sways, knees buckling. He pants hard as he rests his full weight on Draco. \n\u201cFuck,\u201d Draco repeats, running a shaking his hand over his chest and smearing the come there over his collarbone, his Adam\u2019s apple. He can barely think properly, and he shuts his eyes, exhaling roughly before he inhales that intoxicating scent again. Harry, he thinks. Sweat, and skin, and vanilla, and Harry. Draco inhales again, his cock jumping as he withdraws his fingers.\nHarry whimpers at the loss of contact, and Draco opens his eyes, looks down at his fingers. He sees the glistening slick on them, feels Harry\u2019s eyes on him, and without thinking he slips them into his mouth. He looks up at Harry\u2019s face when he hears his sharp intake of breath, feels his nails dig into his shoulders as Harry watches him, eyes glassy and wide. His cheeks are flushed a deep, ruddy red, his mouth open. His cock is still hard, glistening with his own come, and his lips curl into a grimace of arousal as Draco moans around his own fingers, pressing them against his tongue. \nHe shoves Draco roughly onto his back. \n\u201cOff,\u201d he growls, pulling at Draco\u2019s pyjama bottoms as Draco blinks up at him in surprise. \u201cGet these off.\u201d He roughly pulls them to his ankles as Draco does his best to kick them away, to help. His legs are shaking, though, his cock hard and aching and the scar on his side throbs in time with each steady rush of blood as it pumps through him. \n\u201cI need you, need you to fuck me.\u201d Harry kicks his own remaining clothing away then straddles Draco\u2019s waist. He drops his head to Draco\u2019s neck, mouthing frantically over his jaw. He bites it gently. \nHis lips part on a shattered groan as Harry grips his cock, pressing it against his hole. He breathes out thinly through his teeth as he eases himself down, letting Draco\u2019s cock slowly split him open. \n\u201cAh,\u201d Harry\u2019s whole body shivers as Draco\u2019s cock slips inside him, inch by slow, perfect inch. \u201cJe \u2015 Jesus,\u201d he laughs. \u201cYou have no idea how g \u2015 good that feels. How bad I need \u2015 ah!\u201d \n\u201cFuck,\u201d Draco grinds out, eyes open wide and back arched. He feels Harry\u2019s hand on his chest, nails over his skin as Harry closes his eyes, mouth open as he smiles, gasping out in ecstatic relief as he settles fully over Draco\u2019s cock. \n\u201cYes.\u201d Harry drops his head to Draco\u2019s shoulder, knees skidding against the bedsheets as he begins to move in short, quick snaps of his hips. \u201cGod, yes,\u201d he moans again, when Draco moves his hands to Harry\u2019s thighs. He grips them tightly, moves his hands around to Harry\u2019s arse, to where he can feel his own cock pressing inside him. His balls are tight, drawn close to his body and Draco lifts his shoulders off the bed, mouths at Harry\u2019s collarbone. He can barely speak, the pleasure so big it feels like it\u2019s choking him, like every muscle in his body is strung taut and ready to snap and he mouths over Harry\u2019s neck, over his chin to his lips. \nHe feels his cock jerk, beginning to spurt as soon as Harry\u2019s lips meet his. \n\u201cFu \u2015 ahh!\u201d he gasps nonsensically against Harry\u2019s mouth as Harry keeps kissing him, running his mouth over Draco\u2019s in rough messy kisses. Draco\u2019s toes curl, hips lifting off the bed as far as he can as he comes in an overstimulated rush, his cock pulsing inside Harry. He grips Harry\u2019s arse, moves his fingers closer to his hole and feels the slide of his own come as it runs down the length of his cock. \n\u201cGod,\u201d Harry mumbles, pushing back against Draco\u2019s fingers. \u201cGod, you feel so good.\u201d\nDraco\u2019s head drops back against the bed, Harry still kissing him and Draco slowly begins to kiss him back properly as his breathing evens out into something less frantic. He sucks Harry\u2019s lower lip into his mouth, feeling his cock press against his belly, and he\u2019s not sure if Harry came, if he\u2019s hard again, if he ever went soft. Draco\u2019s stomach feels wet, and his head is spinning and he kisses Harry again, deep and soft, moves his lips down over Harry\u2019s jaw. \nHe waits for the pounding in his head, in his body, to subside as his lips move languorously over Harry\u2019s hot and salty-sweet skin. \n\u201cFuck,\u201d Draco rumbles against Harry\u2019s neck, his cock still twitching inside Harry. \u201cI should,\u201d he starts, beginning to move Harry\u2019s hips so he can pull out. He stops when Harry shakes his head.\n\u201cNo, no don\u2019t,\u201d Harry says feverishly, clutching at Draco\u2019s shoulders. \u201cStay inside me,\u201d he whispers, running his lips and then his tongue over Draco\u2019s jaw. \n\u201cAren\u2019t you, ah,\u201d Draco breaks off on a moan as Harry rolls his hips slightly, then sits up, Draco's cock slipping deeper inside him. He can feel his come slide down his balls, feel how wet Harry is now, and Draco runs a hand through his ruined hair. \u201cAren\u2019t you sore?\u201d he asks, looking up at Harry. \n\u201cNo,\u201d Harry shakes his head, grinning almost euphorically as he rolls his hips again, Draco\u2019s still half-hard cock beginning to thicken once more. \n\u201cOh, shit,\u201d Draco mumbles, smiling faintly in surprise, in overheated delirium. \u201cMerlin, I\u2019m hard,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m hard again.\u201d \n\u201cNo, still.\u201d Harry smiles down at him, licks his kiss-swollen lips. \u201cYou\u2019re hard still.\u201d He roll his hips again. He bites his lip, his frown deepening as Draco\u2019s cock swells to full hardness inside him once more. \u201cGod.\u201d Harry\u2019s head drops back, one hand trailing down Draco\u2019s sternum as he cants his hips forwards, runs his other hand over his own swelling cock. \u201cYou have no idea how good that feels.\u201d He flicks his thumb over the head. \u201cHaving you inside me, after waiting for it for so long.\u201d\nDraco\u2019s breath hitches, even as his lips slant into a half-smile. \u201cI thought you were only waiting about an hour,\u201d he rumbles, smiling up at Harry. \n\u201cMmm, well.\u201d Harry runs his tongue over his teeth, then puffs out his cheeks. He shrugs, blows his hair out of his eyes then shrugs playfully. \u201cAn hour. Since we kissed in the park. Give or take.\u201d\nDraco gasps, his overstimulated cock twitching inside Harry. \u201cThat was days ago.\u201d Harry lifts up, the head of Draco\u2019s cock resting inside him, and Draco chokes out another sound. \u201cYou weren\u2019t in heat.\u201d \n\u201cNo.\u201d Harry flicks his hair away from his face, smiles lopsidedly at Draco. \u201cI wasn\u2019t \u2015 oh,!\u201d He sighs in pleasure as he slowly grinds back down, his stomach muscles quivering as a shiver runs over his skin. \u201cFuck.\u201d His fingers curl against Draco's stomach, nails skidding lightly over the skin. \n\u201cYou weren\u2019t in heat then,\u201d Draco repeats dizzily, staring at the way Harry\u2019s body moves, at the tense and release of his muscles and the sheen of sweat over his skin. Harry lets his head drop forward as he smiles slightly, then leans forward and kisses Draco, deep and dirty. He pulls back, lips inches from Draco\u2019s own. \n\u201cStill wanted you to fuck me so badly I couldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d he whispers against them. His grin widens at Draco's groan, and he pulls away, sitting back up when Draco tries to deepen the kiss. Draco laughs breathily, then groans again as Harry runs his fingers over the thin, pale scars before moving them to the thicker bite scar. His cock jerks, elbows twitching up off the bed. \n\u201cFuck, why....\u201d Draco takes a moment to wait for the surge of pleasure-pain to subside. \u201cWhy does that feel \u2015\u201d\n\u201cLike you\u2019ve developed a new erogenous zone?\u201d\nDraco huffs a laugh, ending on a moan as Harry rocks his hips and simultaneously rubs the pad of his thumb, hard, over Draco\u2019s scar. \u201cYes, that,\u201d he gasps out, back arching. \u201cWhy?\u201d \n\u201cNot totally sure,\u201d Harry mumbles, watching Draco avidly as he continues his run his fingers in light and then harder strokes over the oversensitized area. \u201cMine always feels sore, at first. Hard to ignore.\u201d He licks his thumb then brushes it over the area where the scar reaches Draco\u2019s ribs, and Draco moans. \u201cDoesn\u2019t make me react quite like...this, though,\u201d Harry mutters, eyes a little wide as he watches Draco\u2019s face. \u201cBut mine always feels sensitive, kinda turns me on. \u2018Ve been told by others that it happens to them, too.\u201d\n\u201cOthers?\u201d Draco says, his voice low and his eyes narrowing. He clamps down on the surge of possessiveness he feels at the mention of Harry with other Alphas, tries to bury it down, but he sees Harry\u2019s eyes cloud over a little more. \n\u201cDo you have,\u201d Harry whispers hoarsely, \u201cany idea how hot is it when you do that?\u201d\n\u201cDo what?\u201d \n\u201cGet jealous.\u201d Harry leans forward, kissing him again. His cock is hot and hard as it presses against Draco\u2019s stomach, leaving a damp smear against the already drying mess on his belly. \u201cI can sense it,\u201d Harry hisses, placing his hands against the bed and riding Draco faster. \u201cEvery time it happens it\u2019s like, ah, like your scent gets stronger, thicker.\u201d Harry kisses him again, tongue sliding against his. \u201cIn the park, just now. I can sense it.\u201d Another biting kiss, Harry\u2019s lips rough against his own. \u201cWhen you\u2019re jealous, turned on, when you want me. I can sense it.\u201d\nDraco moans, lifting his hips off the bed and knocking Harry off his rhythm slightly. His lips pull up into a grimace as he feels his cock jerk then spurt lightly inside Harry, and he clenches his jaw. His breath whistles out through his teeth. \n\u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d he pants as he lets his head drop back against the mattress. The sheets are rucked up under him, pressing uncomfortably against his lower back, and he can feel Harry\u2019s cock grinding against his stomach still as he buries his face in Draco\u2019s neck, shuddering and gasping hotly as he comes in a warm, wet pulse over Draco\u2019s stomach. He exhales roughly, chest heaving against Draco\u2019s as his rhythm turns languorous once more.\n\u201cGod,\u201d Harry says, letting his head tilt to the side. He smiles down at Draco lazily. \u201cI forgot what this was like,\u201d he says, his grin turning almost goofy. \u201cBeing in heat with someone.\u201d His hair is sticking up on one side, and he rubs the base of his hand over his eyes, still tightening and releasing around Draco. He rubs his eyes again. It\u2019s a tired gesture, absent-minded, and the almost ecstatic smile on his face makes Draco\u2019s overstimulated prick throb. He\u2019s never wanted someone so much in his life, never felt arousal and desire like this, and he feels the jealousy over Harry's other partners rise a little, before something else slips in beside it. He frowns. \n\u201cI didn\u2019t knot,\u201d he whispers, frowning slightly. Harry\u2019s expression softens a little, but his eyes are still unfocussed, his cock half-hard and angling away from his body. It\u2019s shorter than Draco\u2019s, thicker, the head flushed a deep and ruddy red. Draco licks his lips.\n\u201cNight\u2019s still young,\u201d Harry replies, fisting his cock. Draco tears his eyes away from it, meeting Harry\u2019s. \n\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t, if it, oh.\u201d He swallows as Harry runs his other hand over Draco\u2019s neck, thumb pressing lightly over his Adam\u2019s apple. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\u201cThen we keep doing this until it does.\u201d Harry runs his fingers down Draco\u2019s collarbone, down to one nipple. \u201cOr until the heat ends,\u201d he says, expression heated. He pinches the raised nub, rolls it between thumb and forefinger. \n\u201cBut what \u2015\u201d\n\u201cDraco?\u201d Harry pinches his nipple again, hair falling over his brow. His gaze is hooded, fond. \u201cStop thinking so much,\u201d he whispers, lips quirking into a smile. \nDraco frowns. \u201cAnd then it will happen?\u201d\nHarry laughs, eyes sliding shut as he continues to roll his hips. \u201cAre you overthinking not overthinking?\u201d \nDraco groans, face flushed. \u201cPossibly,\u201d he mumbles. \u201cYes.\u201d \n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Draco.\u201d Harry flexes his fingers against Draco\u2019s chest. \u201cJust feel.\u201d\nDraco starts to reply, to argue, but he sighs as another slide of slick runs down his cock, then his balls. He moves his hands to Harry\u2019s waist, tries to curb the worry that\u2019s gnawing inside him, and focus instead on how Harry's skin feels underneath his. Oddly, he find it works. \n\u201cHow long will. Will this.\u201d Draco gasps softly, shutting his eyes against the persistently rolling pleasure in his legs, his belly, his groin. \u201cHow long does it last like this?\u201d \nHarry\u2019s smile widens as he sits upright again, Draco\u2019s cock slipping deeper back inside him. \u201cUntil I\u2019m done with you,\u201d he mutters shakily, messy hair covering one eye. \nHis eyes are still glittering that feverish green, his cheeks ruddy, and Draco\u2019s fingers clench in the bed sheets, itching to touch him. He skates them over Harry\u2019s ribs, down over his thighs, something building in his chest again. He knows he\u2019s just come \u2015 twice \u2015 and that it felt good, but he still feels wired, unsatisfied. There\u2019s something pumping in his veins, along with his blood, something stirring inside him. It\u2019s frightening, new, but not out of his control, Draco reminds himself as he looks up at Harry, at the long plane of his chest. He rakes his nails over Harry\u2019s sides, down to the hair at his belly, then pulls at it lightly. He smiles, baring his teeth when Harry groans, and he pulls at the hair again, harder this time. \nDraco grips Harry, lifting him and flipping him onto his back, feels Harry\u2019s full erection as it presses again, hot and stiff, against his belly. \n\u201cWhen you will be done with me?\u201d he says, resting his hands against the bed, his face inches from Harry\u2019s own. When Harry leans up to kiss him, he pulls back and out of Harry\u2019s reach, and Harry laughs dizzily, then groans, settling his head against the haphazard pillows. \n\u201cWhen the sun comes up?\u201d Draco whispers, brushing his mouth against Harry\u2019s jaw and pushing inside him slowly. Harry groans again. \n\u201cMaybe,\u201d he says, shaking his head a little in contradiction, his voice hitching on a sound as Draco brushes over his prostate. His hands are on Draco\u2019s hips, his sides, clawing at the small of his back. He looks at Draco, and there\u2019s something in them, something that Draco isn't imagining. He\u2019s never heard someone make the word maybe sounds so much like no, and the feel of it, the implication of what Harry means, thrills down his spine. \n\u201cMaybe longer than that?\u201d Draco hears himself ask. His voice is low, his breathing loud as it fills the room and Harry\u2019s eyes slide shut on a low and keening moan as he cants his hips up again. \n\u201cYeah.\u201d Harry swallows, arching his spine. \u201cOh, fuck, yes!\u201d he hisses as Draco starts fucking him again, moving in and then out in slow and shallow thrusts. \n\u201cYes what?\u201d\n\u201cYes, longer than \u2015 ah!\u201d\nHarry\u2019s face creases into a grimace of pleasure, his mouth open, brow furrowed, and Draco\u2019s heart is racing. He\u2019s never been with someone likes this, so responsive, so open. He thinks it\u2019s probably the heat, but then again he thinks that doesn't seem right; it\u2019s not that, not just that. It\u2019s Harry. It\u2019s the way he arches, the way his eyes keep sliding closed then blinking open again as though he wants to keep looking at Draco. \n\u201cYou want me to fuck you through the sunrise,\u201d he states, upping his pace, and Harry lifts his legs higher, one heel skidding into the small of Draco\u2019s back, the other firm at the top of his thigh. Harry\u2019s nodding, his hair catching on the pillow and his hands shaking. \n\u201cFuck, yes,\u201d he says, and then again. \u201cThat, I want that,\u201d he groans, high-pitched and shattered as the bed starts to creak beneath them, gently hitting the wall. Draco lists slightly to the side, leaning his weight fully on one hand, on his knees, as he fucks into him. He runs the fingers of his free hand over Harry\u2019s neck, does it again when Harry tilts it back, exposing the line of his throat to him. Draco presses his thumb gently over his pulse point, imagines he can feels the thud of Harry\u2019s heartbeat against it, before he winds his fingers up into Harry\u2019s hair, over the sweat at the nape of his neck. He licks the line of Harry\u2019s throat, sucks gently at the skin there, breathes that scent down. Sweat and skin and Harry.\nThe urge to bite, to claim, is rising, but that\u2019s all it does. He clenches his teeth, looks down at the skin of Harry\u2019s neck, at the way the tendons pull. He wants his mark on it, wants to own it, but he won't. Draco\u2019s skin prickles with the desire, the urge, the exhilarating rush of holding back and doing what Harry asked. He feels static thrill over his arms, making the hair on the back of his neck stand on end as he feels magic coiling inside him. It's his, but not his at the same time. It feels like it's coming from deep inside him but whipping around him, like air rushing in his ears, and he rubs his teeth over Harry\u2019s skin, nips gently at it then pulls back. He doesn't remember the last time something, anything, felt so good. \n\u201cYes,\u201d Harry keens again, as Draco's lips graze over his sensitive neck once more. \u201cYes, Draco, fuck, keep doing that.\u201d\nDraco does.\n*\nIt\u2019s 6am.\nDraco\u2019s body aches, throbs, blood thudding through his veins and making a racket in his ears. Harry\u2019s on his stomach beneath him, coiled strength and rippling, wiry muscles. His skin is burning against Draco\u2019s, hot and hot and hot and Draco pushes inside him again, slow and hard and sure. \n\u201cFu \u2015 fuck, Draco,\u201d Harry stammers, moaning uncontrollably now. He turns his face into the pillow, one hand curled under it, the other clawing at Draco\u2019s thigh. \nDraco thrusts down again, runs his lips over Harry\u2019s neck then brushes the hair away from his nape. He kisses Harry\u2019s skin, open-mouthed and wet, then gasps out a sound as Harry bucks beneath him, grinding down against the pillow between his legs. He doesn\u2019t know how many times Harry has come, how many times he has himself. He can\u2019t differentiate one rush of pleasure from the next now, the peak and ebb of it blurring into one constant, endless, pulse of sensation. Harry is pliant beneath him, loose and open as he whimpers then bites into the pillow when Draco lifts his knee up higher on the bed, spreading his legs wider. Draco rests his forehead against Harry\u2019s messy hair.\n\u201cHarry,\u201d Draco chokes out, \u201cI want.\u201d He kisses mindlessly at Harry\u2019s hair, his overheated cheek. \u201cI want,\u201d he attempts again, not sure what\u2019s he\u2019s trying to say. Harry\u2019s hair catches on the stubble of his cheek as he frantically nods, curving his back and pushing himself onto Draco\u2019s cock. \n\u201cDo it,\u201d he whines. \u201cDo it, I want it, so, so.\u201d His mouth drops open on a shuddering moan. \u201cPlease, do it.\u201d \n\u201cYes.\u201d\nDraco\u2019s side is burning. He can feel every point of the scar, every ridge of it pulling as his muscles work, his abdomen tightening and releasing as he rolls his hips and thrusts his cock inside Harry. Wet, he thinks, Harry is so wet, and Draco\u2019s oversensitive cock slides inside him in easy, maddening glides. He feels on fire with overstimulation, with the need to come, even though he know he has already, again and again. His cock jerks as Harry tightens around him, and Draco rests his weight on one hand, moves the other to Harry\u2019s arse. He grips it, spreading Harry wide. He watches his cock move inside him, gripping Harry\u2019s arse cheek tight, watching the way Harry fucks back against him. Draco feels the sweat prickle down his spine, over his forehead, and his hand skids out from underneath him. He drops down to his elbow, kissing over Harry\u2019s shoulder, over the ridge of his scar, then back to his neck. \n\u201cFuck, Harry.\u201d \n\u201cPlease, Dr \u2015 Draco, \u201d Harry says, imploringly, and Draco nods even though he isn\u2019t sure what Harry is asking. Harry must be so tired, Draco thinks absently, so tired and sore, and Draco wants him to feel good. He wants to give Harry what he wants, what he needs. He rolls his hips again, his hip bones grinding against Harry\u2019s arse and his cock still buried deep inside him. Whatever it is Harry\u2019s asking for, Draco wants to give it to him. \n\u201cDraco,\u201d Harry says again, low and desperate. \u201cPlease, do it, I need,\u201d he breaks off on a choked gasp, hands clawing at the sheets beneath him as he pushes back against Draco. \u201cI want \u2015\u201d \n\u201cYes,\u201d Draco croaks against Harry\u2019s skin, rubbing his nose over the top of his spine. He feels Harry shiver as he curves his hips down again, his cock stroking into him without really pulling out. He wants to be deeper, he thinks, wants to fill Harry up, but he already is. It doesn\u2019t make any sense, he thinks dizzily, but he doesn\u2019t care. He pushes his hips forwards again, kisses over the bump at the top of Harry\u2019s spine, then moves his lips to Harry\u2019s scar. Harry jolts as if burned. \n\u201cAh!\u201d Harry\u2019s hand flies back to Draco\u2019s neck, to grip his hair, and Draco does it again, harder this time. Harry keens, the sounds growing louder, higher, as Harry pushes back against Draco, searching for more, for something. Draco licks over the scar again. \n\u201cFuck,\u201d Harry pants, \u201cFuck, please.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cPlease!\u201d \n\u201cYes,\u201d Draco whispers again, his voice hoarse and raw. He doesn't know what he\u2019s answering, but at the same time he does. He knows what Harry wants, what will end the heat, what Harry needs. He knows. His hips stutter in their pace, as his teeth graze hard over the skin of Harry\u2019s neck, and Harry gasps \u2015 before Draco quickly pulls away.\n\u201cSor \u2015 fuck, sorry,\u201d he mumbles, shaking his hair out of his eyes. \u201cI won\u2019t \u2015\u201d he starts, but Harry shakes his head. \n\u201cThis, like this,\u201d Harry tightens the fingers in his hair, pulling him back towards him as Draco presses his chest against Harry\u2019s back, feels his nipples tighten as they brush over Harry\u2019s skin. He kisses Harry\u2019s neck again, hears him moan, and then tentatively sucks at the skin there. Harry mewls. \nDraco feels his cock thickening, feels it become harder to pull out with each thrust, each deep grind forwards meeting resistance when Draco pulls his hips back. His knees catch against the sheets, Harry\u2019s legs bracketing them. He can feel his own come as it slips out of Harry, feel the slick as it runs down the inside of Harry\u2019s leg, and Draco burrows his face into Harry\u2019s neck, wraps his arm under him and hikes him up higher. He focuses on that scent, on the feeling of Harry\u2019s hair against his cheeks, of the salty tang on his skin beneath his lips. The rush of arousal builds inside him, rolling up his spine in a sensational and terrifying wave, and he chokes out a sound against Harry\u2019s neck, as he tries to pull out \u2015 and can\u2019t. \n\u201cAh, ye \u2015 yes!,\u201d Harry\u2019s hand flies to Draco\u2019s hip, keeping him still, even as Draco jerks, then tenses. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay,\u201d Harry whispers frantically. His voice is reedy and unfocussed as his body trembles beneath Draco\u2019s, as he tries to make himself speak; Draco clings to it. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, le \u2015 let it happ \u2015 uh \u2015 it\u2019s okay, Dra \u2015 uh!\u201d \nHarry gives up, rolling his hips against the pillow beneath him and bucking up against Draco as he shouts, his body tightening around the thick weight of Draco's cock and his cock pulsing onto the pillow beneath his hips. Draco shuts his eyes, slips both arms around Harry\u2019s chest as he jerks and twists. He pulls Harry as close to him as he can, repeating Harry\u2019s half-spoken words inside his head. \nLet it happen, he thinks, rolling his hips and grunting at the overwhelming pleasure of it, as he feels his cock swell further, his balls drawing up even tighter. Let it happen, let it happen, let it \u2015 \nDraco\u2019s whole body stills. He blinks the sweat out of his eyes, feels his cock twitching and pulsing. It feels like he\u2019s coming, only at the same time it feels entirely different, like an orgasm only every muscle on his body is centred on it \u2015 on the point where Draco\u2019s cock is buried deep inside Harry, where Harry\u2019s hole is stretched wide, impossibly wide around him. Draco makes another sound, trying to speak, but he can\u2019t, can only manage a strangled grunt against Harry\u2019s skin. He feels Harry nod frantically beneath him, \u201cyes,\u201d tumbling out of his mouth as his fingers scrabble at Draco's thigh, as he pushes himself back against Draco. Draco struggles to get more air inside his lungs, to push it out again, but the room is spinning. His lips move over Harry\u2019s neck, the scent of his skin grounding him, stopping Draco from panicking even as wave after wave of dizzying release makes his heart pound, his head spin, makes the air crackle around him. \n\u201cYes,\u201d Harry whispers giddily, \u201cDraco, fuck, yes, that\u2019s \u2015\u201d \nWarm, Draco thinks, rolling his hips and shutting his eyes, he\u2019s warm, and safe, and his body jerks again, his cock aching and thrilling with pleasure at the same time.\n\u201cYes,\u201d he hears Harry ecstatically whisper one last time, fingers tight as they grip Draco\u2019s, before the room slips into darkness.\n*\nIt\u2019s light again when Draco opens his disoriented eyes, sunlight barely streaming in through the crack of his closed curtains.\nHe\u2019s thirsty, he thinks, incredibly thirsty, and sore, but mostly he\u2019s warm, and exhausted, and his arms are wrapped around a lean, strong body. Draco hums, nuzzling closer. He doesn't want to wake up yet, he thinks, and he burrows his face further into the mess of hair in front of him, breathes in deeply. He runs his fingers over the back pressed to his chest, before he frowns. He\u2019s lying on his side, he realises, somewhat diagonal across the bed, and he tries to sit up, to right the sheets that someone has pulled half way over his legs. He hisses as the strange jolt of pain he feels, of resistance, when he realises he can\u2019t.\n\u201cWhat,\u201d he whispers in hoarse confusion, trying to sit up again. He looks down his body, resting his weight on one elbow and widening his eyes when full comprehends why he can\u2019t pull away from Harry. \u201cFuck,\u201d he mumbles, slightly panic-stricken, tensing further when Harry stirs. \n\u201cNo, s\u2019okay,\u201d Harry mumbles thickly, his hand gripping Draco\u2019s thigh. \u201c\u2019ll go down soon.\u201d\n\u201cWhat \u2015\u201d\n\u201cShh.\u201d Harry pulls Draco arms around his chest again, rubs his cheek over Draco\u2019s forearm, then kisses the back of his hand. Draco groans at the warmth that blooms in chest at that, as his cock twitches almost painfully inside Harry. \n\u201cGod,\u201d he breathes out shakily. \u201cKnot,\u201d he murmurs. He chokes out a thick laugh. \n\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry agrees, his tone drowsy. He doesn\u2019t sound tired, so much as dazed, and Draco lifts his head. Harry\u2019s eyes are open, staring ahead, as his fingers stroke the back of Draco\u2019s hand in slow, rhythmic gestures. His chest is rising and falling evenly. \u201cS\u2019weird, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he murmurs drowsily, and Draco bites his lip, then nods. He tightens his hands around Harry, rests his cheek on the side of Harry\u2019s head. He shuts his eyes. \n\u201cDoes it feel okay?\u201d he whispers roughly, not trusting himself to speak any louder. He feels Harry hum, the vibrations soft against the hand Harry has cradled against his chest. \n\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry replies softly. \u201cVery.\u201d He swallows, throat clicking. \u201cFeels amazing. Full,\u201d he adds after a moment. \u201cFeels almost like I\u2019m high, but I\u2019m not. Like Felix,\u201d Harry mumbles, then dopily puffs a soft laugh, and Draco frowns, not sure what that means. He likes it though, like that Harry isn\u2019t sore, isn\u2019t uncomfortable. He must be though, Draco thinks, must be aching, but Harry only sighs, low and contented as he relaxes further against Draco, his body limp with exhaustion. \u201cTalk more later,\u201d Harry murmurs. \u201cTalk properly later, but now. You.\u201d Harry shifts, then closes his eyes. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asks softly. \nDraco rouses himself, opening his eyes with some effort. He isn\u2019t sure how to answer that. His body still feels wired, antsy, but it doesn\u2019t feel uncomfortable anymore. He feels good, he realises, right down to his bones, sated and satisfied. He curls his toes, sitting up as far as he can and then finally reaching the corner of the sheets. He grunts with the effort of it, feels Harry stir below him, and Draco runs his knuckles soothingly down his side. He looks at Harry\u2019s profile, as much as he can see. His eyes are closed, now, his mouth slack with sleep. The fingers of one hand twitch as Draco slips the sheets around Harry. It fills Draco with a sudden and striking affection, and he Summons a pillow from the floor and then slips it under Harry\u2019s head. He lays back down, hands around Harry\u2019s waist once more. He slips his fingers between Harry\u2019s own.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d He kisses Harry\u2019s shoulder, then does it again when Harry moans softly. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m okay.\u201d\n*\nWhen Draco wakes again, they\u2019re no longer tied.\nHe also feels like he\u2019s been hit by a small train, if not the Hogwarts Express itself. He smacks his lips together, frowning as he rubs his forehead over his pillow, trying to decide if he's properly waking up, or going back to sleep. His bed is ruined, the sheets messy and lying half on the floor, and he thinks he slept half the night without a pillow, given the way his neck aches. He groans as tries to twist it and ease away the knot of pain, when he blinks eyes wide. \nKnot. \n\u201cSalazar,\u201d Draco mumbles shakily, trying to process what\u2019s happened. He did it, he thinks giddily \u2015 did it, and nothing bad happened. The world didn't end, he didn't feel out of control, animalistic, beset by Dark Magic. Draco smiles, happily and only a little wryly, as he thinks of all those years of dreaded seasonal turns, of the taste of the potions and the Healer visits. And then, of course, the slowly worsening aftermath of the rut \u2015 the dizzy spells, the nausea, and then the eventual blackouts. Draco remembers waking up to see Pansy\u2019s worried face hovering over his own, the feeling of the bathroom tiles cold as they pressed against his steadily bruising cheek. He remembers how tired he felt, how panicked, how wrong. He feels tired now, but it's not the same. There's nothing gnawing inside his gut, behind his eyes. He feels dizzy, but from lack of sleep, and his body aches but this time from exertion. Underneath, he knows he feels good. He knows he\u2019ll have to go back to the Healers to confirm it, will spend the next few days on the lookout for any signs that something is still wrong, and he doubts he\u2019ll be able to escape Olivia\u2019s clutches when he returns. He thinks she\u2019ll want him to talk about it, about the other issues weighing him down, and he oddly doesn't feel that put off by the idea of it. He already feels a little lighter, after a week of disarming honesty with Harry.\nDraco presses his cheek against the pillow again, feels a folded corner creasing his skin. His face flushes, familiar and unfamiliar warmth running through him. He hopes he can keep talking about this with Harry, too, he realises. He curls his arms a little tighter around the pillow as another realisation, both surprising and not surprising in the least, hits him properly. \nHe doesn't want Harry to leave.\nDraco starts when he feels a hand on his back, a broad palm curving around his shoulder. He sighs when Harry kisses the back of his neck. \n\u201cDraco?\u201d Harry whispers, and Draco grunts in response, exhausted and aching and incredibly, suddenly, relieved that Harry is still here. He breathes out roughly against the pillow, trying to get his racing heart to stop. Of course he\u2019s still here, Draco tells himself. He\u2019s not likely to have run off the second he could; even if he\u2019d wanted to, he's probably too knackered to get very far. At least, that\u2019s what Draco tells himself, trying not to have to think properly about how he feels about Harry \u2015 at least not just yet. \n\u201cY\u2019h?\u201d Draco mumbles, turning so he can look at Harry. \nHarry looks exhausted. There are deep bags under his eyes as he leans on one elbow and looks down at Draco. His hair is phenomenally messy, dark wavy strands curling around his neck, over his forehead, and there\u2019s a bruise on his neck. From me, Draco thinks, flushing. From where he\u2019d sucked the previous evening. Draco runs his fingers over his mouth, stares back at Harry\u2019s wide green eyes, vibrant behind the frames of his glasses. His breath hitches a little when Harry smiles. \n\u201cHey,\u201d he says softly. \u201cYou're awake.\u201d \n\u201cMmm.\u201d Draco runs his cheek against the pillow. \u201cWhat an incredibly asinine observation,\u201d he replies. \nHe brushes his leg against Harry\u2019s to let him know he\u2019s joking, smiles up at him through his own tangled fringe. Harry\u2019s cheek dimples as he returns it. \n\u201cDo you want to have a shower with me?\u201d he asks, head rested on his shoulder. \n\u201cOh,\u201d Draco stretches, turning onto his back. Impulsively, he runs the backs of his finger down Harry\u2019s chest, lets them linger over one nipple. Harry shuts his eyes as Draco runs his knuckles over it, feeling it harden under the touch. He exhales on a sound, a sharp little moan. Draco watches his face, the flicker of arousal over it and the flush still lingering on his skin. He leans forward and quickly licks the peaked nub, then sucks it into his mouth.\nHarry suppresses another moan as Draco slips his hands between his legs and finds him hard. Draco hums, pulling at Harry\u2019s nipple with his lips before releasing it. He\u2019s not hard himself, and he\u2019s somewhat surprised \u2015 delighted \u2015 to find Harry is. He rubs his hand over Harry\u2019s prick, listens to him hiss slightly at the contact on his oversensitive skin. Draco frowns as a thought occurs to him. \n\u201cAre you still \u2015\u201d he begins to say, but he stops when Harry shakes his head. \n\u201cNo, heat\u2019s done.\u201d He looks to the side then back again. \u201cFor the most part, anyway.\u201d \n\u201cThe most part?\u201d Draco leans over Harry, forcing himself to sit up with some effort. Merlin, it's unfathomable that he feels this knackered after sex, he thinks. But then again, he\u2019s never had that much, consecutively or otherwise, in any other scenario in his life. He looks at Harry evenly. \u201cThat sounds maddeningly vague,\u201d he finishes, and Harry laughs. \n\u201cLife as an Omega often is,\u201d he says, with a tone of playful, faux wisdom. Draco runs his hand down Harry\u2019s stomach. He likes the hair there, he thinks, the way it runs along the line of his abs, below his bellybutton and then to his groin. \n\u201cSo you\u2019re not in heat anymore,\u201d Draco rests his fingers just above Harry\u2019s prick, \u201cjust randy?\u201d \nHarry\u2019s belly twitches as he laughs. \u201cI am and I\u2019m not.\u201d He sits up, resting his weight on his hands. \u201cIt\u2019s like,\u201d he grimaces a little as he adjusts his position, \u201cresidual\u2026\u201d Harry\u2019s eyes slides closed as he searches for the word, smiling. Draco can\u2019t stop himself from laughing. \n\u201cMerlin, Potter.\u201d He moves his hand to Harry\u2019s thigh, watches him open his eyes. \u201cAre you sure you're okay?\u201d \n\u201cBeing knotted just feels incredibly good,\u201d he replies, grinning goofily again, and Draco flushes. \u201cMy body's kind of\u2026 still feeling it.\u201d \n\u201cOh.\u201d Draco clears his throat, cheeks burning. \u201cI. Um.\u201d \nHarry\u2019s smile widens. He raises his leg, bumps it against Draco\u2019s side. \n\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d \nDraco bites his lip. Exhausted, wonderful, and like I want to kiss you until you can\u2019t breathe, Draco thinks, but instead he waits a moment, lets the impulse to blurt that out pass him by. \n\u201cSticky,\u201d he eventually says, mouth curving into what he\u2019s sure is a stupid smile. It gets wider when Harry huffs a laugh in reply. \nDraco suspects he might look smitten, and it worries him \u2015 or it would, really, if Harry\u2019s shoulders weren't shaking with pleased laughter, his knee still against Draco\u2019s side. Draco wonders if perhaps he\u2019s feeling the effect of residual pheromones from the rut himself, if that\u2019s what\u2019s making his stomach flip. The argument would be much more convincing, though, if he hadn't already felt this impossible fondness beforehand. He thinks that being romantically and sexually interested in someone before, during, and the morning after a night like that means he\u2019s just\u2026. romantically interested in them, raging hormones or no. Draco leans his weight into Harry a little more. \nIt means he just likes Harry. \nHarry laughs again, softly this time. \u201cCome and have a shower with me,\u201d he repeats. \nDraco\u2019s forehead creases as he considers it. His legs are sore, his stomach empty. His shoulders ache, and even his forearms hurt, and there's a twinge in his jaw from being clenched. \n\u201cBath,\u201d he says after a moment. \u201cWe should have a bath.\u201d\nIn the end, they compromise, and decide to have both in order of suggestion. \nDraco steps over the lip of the tub, letting the shower spray hit him. Immediately he steps back until his shoulders hit the tiles, carefully avoiding the tab. His shower is over his bath, a large white porcelain tub that can easily fit them both, and he lets Harry fiddle with the temperature. He shuts his eyes, sagging a little against the wall, then hums when he feels Harry\u2019s hands on his shoulders. \n\u201cDon't fall asleep.\u201d \n\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d Draco snorts. \u201cNot quite fifty yet.\u201d \n\u201cDon't fall over, either,\u201d Harry whispers. \nDraco laughs, groaning as he turns around. He lets the water run over his head, listens to the sounds of the room distort as the water fills his ears. \n\u201cMarginally more likely,\u201d he mumbles. He feels Harry\u2019s arm curve around his waist, then closes his eyes under the spray, dropping his head back to Harry\u2019s shoulders. He moans softly, as Harry begins to massage his scalp.\n\u201cIf you keep doing that,\u201d Draco hears Harry pop open the cap of the shampoo, then begin to work it into Draco\u2019s hair, \u201cI may actually fall asleep.\u201d\n\u201cMmm.\u201d Harry tilts Draco\u2019s head to rinse the shampoo out, working his fingers over Draco\u2019s neck. \u201c\u2018M not surprised.\u201d He picks up the soap, then begins to work his sudsy hands down over Draco\u2019s shoulders, his back. \u201cAfter last night.\u201d \n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you? More tired, that is,\u201d Draco clarifies, resting his hands against the shower wall and stretching his shoulders out. \nHarry\u2019s hands stop at his hips. He squeezes them gently, leans close to Draco\u2019s ear. \u201cJust got better stamina, I think.\u201d He bites at Draco\u2019s earlobe playfully. \n\u201cOh, fuck you very much,\u201d Draco retorts as Harry laughs, moving his hands over Draco\u2019s chest and letting the suds build over his skin. Draco sighs, almost sad to have the last of Harry\u2019s scent, his come, wash off of him. It\u2019s bizarre, he knows, and he shakes his head at himself, squashing down the laugh that wants to burble out of him. Of all things to get bloody sentimental over, he thinks, as Harry\u2019s hands leaves his body and he begins to wash himself off. \n\u201cI\u2019ll crash later,\u201d Harry says after a moment. \u201cIf history is indication, that is. I\u2019ll wake up well, then get stupidly hungry, then hit the wall in a few hours and be no good for anything until tomorrow.\u201d He stretches his arm out, washing down the length of it. The movement accidentally brings him closer to Draco, bent forwards slightly and pressed against the wall as he is, and Draco smiles. \n\u201cHarry?\u201d \n\u201cYeah?\u201d \nDraco bites his lip when he feels Harry\u2019s erection pressing against his arse again. \u201cAre you planning on fucking me?\u201d he mumbles, still smiling. Harry steps back quickly with a shaky laugh. \n\u201cOh, god, sorry. Didn\u2019t realise I \u2015\u201d\n\u201cYou can, you know,\u201d Draco moves back, pressing himself against Harry. \u201cI like that,\u201d he adds, when Harry sighs, slipping his arms around Draco\u2019s waist and letting his cock press against his arse cheek. \u201cOr you can just do that.\u201d\n\u201cBut you\u2019re tired.\u201d Harry kisses the wing of Draco's shoulder blade. \u201cI don\u2019t have to \u2015\u201d\n\u201cI want you to,\u201d Draco blurts, moving his hand to Harry\u2019s hip and pulling him closer. He sighs when Harry\u2019s cock slips between his cheeks, the soap suds making it slide easily.He smiles when Harry drops his forehead to Draco\u2019s shoulder, and begins to rock his hips gently. \n\u201cI want you to come,\u201d he repeats, and he means it. He isn\u2019t sure he can come again himself, if he\u2019s even likely to get full hard, but he wants Harry to. He likes the noises he makes, the way his prick feels pressed against Draco\u2019s skin, the way Draco can still catch his scent in the air, despite the spray of the shower and the faint lavender of the soap. He likes that there is no rush to this, the thrust of Harry\u2019s hips almost lazy compared to how he felt last night, and Draco sighs when Harry moves his hand between his legs, touching his flaccid cock. \n\u201cYou\u2019re not \u2015\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d Draco says emphatically. \u201cFeels nice.\u201d He sucks on his lip as Harry moves his hand lower, cups his balls. \u201cMerlin, that.\u201d Draco swallows. \u201cFeels nice,\u201d he repeats, with feeling. \nHarry kisses his shoulder again, his cock sliding between Draco\u2019s cheeks. He gasps as Draco moves his fingers to his arse cheek, reaching behind him to run them gently over Harry\u2019s hole. He sucks gently at Draco\u2019s shoulder, kissing up to his neck as his pace falters, his hips jerking as Draco moves his fingers over the slick of his abused rim. \nDraco bites his lip as he feels Harry\u2019s cock twitch, that scent filling the air again as Harry\u2019s come hits the base of his spine, his arse, before it\u2019s washed away. Harry\u2019s hands tighten on his hips, his mouth open and his tongue resting against Draco\u2019s skin as he kisses him again, then pulls away. \n\u201cFuck,\u201d Harry pants. \n\u201cMmm.\u201d Draco returns his hands to the wall. \u201cWhat was that about stamina?\u201d he murmurs. He feels Harry laugh, then breathe out heavily. There\u2019s a moment before he replies. \n\u201cMight amend that to \u2018completely wrecked\u2019,\u201d Harry mumbles, his voice thick and drowsy. He\u2019s leaning more than a little of his weight on Draco, and Draco reaches out, dropping the plug onto the basin of the bath. He maneuvers it into the hole with his toe, letting the shower stream begin to fill the tub, making the executive decision that standing up was not longer something either of them could be bothered with. \n\u201cCome on.\u201d He nudges Harry with his shoulder, then turns, sitting down as the tub continues to fill around them. He changes the temperature with a wave of his hand, then pulls Harry back against his chest. He\u2019s pliable again, rubbing at his eyes in what is now a familiar gesture, and Draco rests his chin on his head. \n\u201cToo hot,\u201d Harry grumbles, lying one leg over the edge of the tub. Draco tightens his arm around his waist. \n\u201cPerfect temperature.\u201d \n\u201cHot,\u201d Harry insists with a laugh, letting his hands float in the water ahead of him. Draco turns the tap off with another wave of his hand, listens to the sudden quiet of the bathroom. The waters swishes as they move, settling comfortably. Draco feels overwhelmingly happy, sated, excited, but there\u2019s something else underneath which won\u2019t quite leave him. He looks at the water dripping off of Harry\u2019s leg and onto the bathroom tiles, the way his chest rises and falls as he breathes evenly. Draco presses his tongue against his teeth, before forcing himself to speak. \n\u201cSo what happens from here?\u201d he asks quietly. There\u2019s another moment of quiet, before Harry hums. \n\u201cDepends, really.\u201d Harry swishes one hand through the water. \n\u201cOn?\u201d\n\u201cOn what you want to happen from here,\u201d he says quietly. \n\u201cI want.\u201d Draco licks his lips, takes a deep breath. \u201cI want to make you breakfast,\u201d he says into Harry\u2019s hair. He feels rather than hears Harry laugh softly in response.\n\u201cIt\u2019s late. Well past breakfast time,\u201d he says, a little playful, but there's something else underneath it, that Draco can't quite place. A little hopeful, he thinks, but the kind that Draco's all too familiar with; it\u2019s hope, but hedged with caution, uncertainty. Draco\u2019s own heart kicks up a beat. \n\u201cBrunch, then,\u201d he murmurs, brushing Harry\u2019s wet hair away from his forehead. Harry chuckles. \n\u201cOkay. Yes. Feed me.\u201d His eyes are closed, his head against Draco\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThen what do you want to happen?\u201d\nDraco traces his finger down the line of the faint scar on Harry's forehead. It\u2019s so much paler, smaller than he remembers it being. He wonders if this is why Harry always wears his hair a little on the long side, always lets it flop over his forehead. He swallows, adding this to the ever growing list of things he wants to know about Harry. \n\u201cI want you to stay,\u201d he whispers quickly, the words falling out of his mouth in a rush. \u201cTonight.\u201d he clears his throat, forces himself to ask again, louder this time. \u201cWill you stay again tonight?\u201d \nHarry\u2019s forehead creases a little as he sits up. It\u2019s not a frown, more the beginning of an expression Harry can\u2019t seem to contain. Confusion, perhaps, Draco thinks it might be. He tucks his own wet hair behind his ear. \u201cMy heat\u2026 my heat\u2019s over,\u201d he says quietly, as if Draco might not be fully aware of that, or as if he needs to be sure that Draco knows this. \n\u201cI know.\u201d Draco licks his lips, searching Harry\u2019s eyes and trying to ignore the queasy roll of his stomach, the loud thump of his heart. \u201cWill you stay again tonight, anyway?\u201d The waters sloshes as Harry moves again, looking at Draco\u2019s face intently, and Draco starts talking again, half nervousness and half determination to say this out loud, whether his churning insides like it or not. \u201cAnd can we get tea again?\u201d he murmurs, looking at Harry closely, his stomach fluttering as Harry starts to smile. \u201cSomewhere you choose. Wherever.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d Harry says shakily, then nods. He looks happy, surprised, and still a little bit confused, as he adds, \u201cI\u2019d...like that.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Draco can feel his cheeks pulling up into a stupid grin as Harry lays down once more, his back against Draco\u2019s chest. \u201cAnd we can go back to the park,\u201d he murmurs, rubbing his nose against Harry\u2019s cheekbone. He can feel Harry\u2019s cheeks as they slip into a wide smile as well. \n\u201cYou hated the gazebo.\u201d\n\u201cI liked it with you.\u201d\nHarry laughs, a little too loud. It\u2019s genuine and goofy, and he moves his hand over his mouth. \u201cAnd I\u2026 can. I can come over again?\u201d Harry stops, pressing his lips together. \u201cWe can do this again?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d Draco runs his lips over Harry\u2019s temple. \u201cI want you to come back.\u201d\nHarry makes a soft sound, running his hand over his jaw. His mouth moves as he starts to form a question, then stops. It takes another few tries, Harry\u2019s face flushing a soft red before he finally gets the sentence out. \n\u201cAnd it would be. Can.\u201d He takes a breath, turning his face back towards Draco. \u201cJust to be clear that we\u2019re on the same page. I mean I think we are, but. Can.\u201d Harry rubs at his cheek. \u201cCan we do it without a contract?\u201d\nDraco laughs, nodding. His nose bumps against Harry\u2019s cheek as Draco slides lower in the tub. His face hurts from smiling. He kisses the line of Harry\u2019s cheekbone, can feel how hot his face is. \n\u201cYes.\u201d He kisses Harry\u2019s cheek again. \u201cNo contract. Just...us.\u201d He sighs, then stretches his leg out. His stomach is churning still, but no longer anxiously. It feels like excitement, like happiness. \n\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry murmurs, laughing again. \u201cI\u2019d like it to be just us.\u201d He bends his legs, knees poking out of the water. Draco stares at them. They\u2019re a little knobbly still, a little boney. He feels an incredible rush of fondness, alongside the reminder of who this is, of their shared past. He knows there\u2019s more that they'll have to talk through, that telling people will be difficult, possibly even explosive. He knows that they\u2019ll probably fight as well, the two of them, and that he himself is no walk in the park to date, based on the few people he\u2019s tried it with. He can\u2019t bring himself to care, though. He doesn\u2019t want to overthink this, to sabotage it with uncertainty before it\u2019s even begun. The feeling is nice, and so is having Harry\u2019s skin against his. Let it happen, he thinks, then almost laughs, giddy and stupid. \nHe traces one finger around the edge of the bite scar on Harry's shoulder, not quite touching it, and lets himself imagine for one dizzy moment what it might be like to have company after the full moon, someone who feels as awful as he does. The thought alone makes his chest lurch with emotion. \nHe turns his face into Harry\u2019s hair, breathes his scent down easily. Water, soap, and underneath that, vanilla, burnt sugar and lime. \nJust let it bloody happen. \nDraco sighs, smiling. \n\u201cI\u2019d like it to be just us, too.\u201d\n*"
