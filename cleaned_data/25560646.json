    "text": "\nIt was a normal day when the chaos started, emphasis on the \u2018\n\nwas\n\n\u2019. Class 1-A was in session, school was about to end for the day, and the weekend was only an arm\u2019s length away. The students were barely listening to their homeroom teacher as they did their best to sneakily pack their bags- and then, abruptly, Aizawa shut off the display, facing them head on.\n\n\n\u201cAlright, since you\u2019ve all decided that this lesson isn\u2019t \n\ninteresting\n\n enough to keep your attention,\u201d Aizawa started, flashing his Quirk for good measure, \u201cwe\u2019ll be doing a more...hands on approach to the matter.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThe statement managed to catch the interest of his students, the twenty kids finally giving their full attention to the man. After all, the topic had been about creating hero personas, and how some heroes separate their normal identity from their hero one by acting differently...how could Aizawa turn the lecture into an assignment?\n\n\n\u201cMost of you seem to act as you normally would when you put on your hero outfits, except for a select few of you,\u201d Aizawa pointed out, eyeing them with boredom. \u201cThe only student that I can firmly say is creating a type of persona is Midoriya. The rest of you don\u2019t change a single thing.\u201d Most of the class shrunk in on themselves, embarrassed for not changing themselves or, in Midoriya\u2019s case, being so obvious that his smile was for show like All Might.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThat isn\u2019t necessarily a \n\nbad\n\n thing, just like it isn\u2019t automatically \n\ngood\n\n. That\u2019s why, instead of forcing you all to create hero personas...I\u2019m going to have you put on a peer\u2019s persona.\u201d\n\n\nAizawa took a moment to pause, letting his students work themselves up into a flurry of questions with this new information.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cIf no one but Midori has a persona, how are we supposed to mimic anyone else?\u201d Ashido asked, confused.\n\n\n\u201cHow will we decide who is who?\u201d Iida asked. \u201cWill we draw lots, or be allowed to choose for ourselves?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCan there be more than one of a person? Are people just swapping roles?\u201d Hagakure asks. \u201cOoh! Can I be Yaomomo? Or Deku?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy the \n\nfuck\n\n would you want to be Deku? He just cries the whole time!\u201d Bakugou sneered, and Midoriya curled in on himself even more, if that was even possible.\n\n\nMore questions filled the air, and after a few more moments of excitement Aizawa cleared his throat. The class quieted immediately.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI will choose who everyone gets. There will only be one of each person. I will give you your peer to copy, and you may \n\nnot\n\n directly say who you are supposed to be to \n\nany\n\n of your classmates. The point is to get into character as best as you can...without going into the other changing rooms, of course.\u201d Aizawa let the girls take a second to glare at Mineta, who flinched.\n\n\nSmirking, Aizawa added, \u201cI will give some of you more difficult personas, ones that will directly conflict with your normal actions. I expect you all to stay in character the entire day on Monday.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIs there a prize for the best actor?\u201d Ashido asked, and Aizawa hummed before grinning wider.\n\n\n\u201cSure. The student who acts the most like their character gets a perfect score. The student who successfully strays away from their own personality in order to achieve their characterization gets five points extra credit. The person who freaks out Present Mic the most while achieving those other goals will get a free pass off of any assignment of their choosing.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThe class perked up at the offers, and Aizawa rolled his eyes as he watched his students grow determined to win. Sitting down, Aizawa quickly wrote down each of his students\u2019 names on little slips of paper, then passed them out. As the bell rang, Aizawa called out, \u201cRemember the rules. Don\u2019t tell anyone who you are, do your best, and stick with the character for all of Monday.\u201d\n\n\nOh, if only he knew what chaos he had started.\n\n\n-----\n\n\nMonday starts about as normally as any Monday does, but it\u2019s a little off kilter from the very beginning. Usually, Iida is the first one to enter the room. However, today is different.\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s why Ochaco Uraraka is the first student to enter the classroom, half an hour early to class like an overachieving student would be. She walks with a stiff gait and her head held high, a tenseness in her shoulders that is never there normally. She sits in her seat, diligently pulling out her notebook and sitting properly.\n\n\nAnd then she giggles, but nobody knows because she\u2019s all alone- except for Aizawa, but he\u2019s well asleep on the floor.\u00a0\n\n\nIt takes seven minutes for the next student to arrive, now only twenty-three minutes remaining before class. Mina Ashido walks in, steps far more graceful and far less bouncy than usual. Her hands are clasped politely in front of her- and then her small smile breaks into a careless grin as she spots her peer.\n\n\n\u201cHey, \u2018Raka!\u201d Ashido greets, a little too loud, and then she cringes. \u201cI mean, good morning.\u201d Voice softer, and with a polite nod, Ashido takes her seat.\n\n\nEight minutes pass, with fifteen minutes before the bell, and more students arrive. Yuga Aoyama frowns as he enters, dark eyeshadow and mascara on in an attempt to seem...goth? Tsuyu prances into the room, giving a carefree wave as she drops into her seat. Rikido Satou curls in on himself, but still gives a warm smile as he enters. Hanta Sero greets everyone politely, and tries to be more at ease. Mashirao Ojirou, however, seems to have a wider, almost forced smile that seems just a little too big.\u00a0\n\n\nThree more minutes pass. Twelve minutes remain before the bell. Denki Kaminari comes in, mouth covered with a mask and surprisingly quiet for once. Ejirou Kirishima walks in, waves, then pulls out a packet of sugar and pours it into his mouth- only grimacing at the taste once, to his credit. Kyoka Jirou walks in, blush on her cheeks and a kind smile on her face. Mezo Shouji walks in, freezes, and then excitedly shakes his limbs- all six of them- as he greets them, as if trying to be more noticeable. Koji Kouda walks in last, still meek but trying as he gestures to the makeshift belt around his waist, then pulls out some glitter and throws it into the air. (Aoyama breaks character for a moment to cheer Kouda on, but Aizawa seems to still be sleeping so his peers let it slide.)\n\n\nTwo more minutes pass. Ten minutes remain before class. Tooru Hagakure walks in with a loud \u2018kero\u2019 before heading to her desk. Minoru Mineta walks in, cut up cords hanging off of his ears, and what looks like two of his purple balls stuck to his chest. (If Uraraka throws the boy out of the window, claiming it\u2019s her \u2018duty as class representative\u2019, nobody bats an eye. She\u2019s staying in character, hand chops and all.)\u00a0\n\n\nA minute passes, with only nine left. Shouto Todoroki walks in, calm as usual as he sits at his desk. Then he pauses, blinks, and says, \u201cYou guys are so manly\u201d in the most unenthusiastic tone the phrase has ever been spoken in.\n\n\nAnother minute goes, with eight remaining. Mineta runs back into the classroom, Quirk-supplied balls notably absent, and Uraraka lets him sit down. Fumikage Tokoyami follows seconds after, looking at them all with disinterest before sitting at his desk. He doesn\u2019t say a word, and no one is quite sure if he\u2019s playing a character or not.\u00a0\n\n\nTwo minutes pass, six are left. Momo Yaoyorozu walks in, expression one of regret as she passes the front, before schooling into determination.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cMy apologies,\u201d Yaoyorozu whispers, and that\u2019s the only warning Ashido gets before the normally prim and proper girl tugs at the other\u2019s skirt, lifting it a mere centimeter before rushing off, face bright red and full of remorse. The class stares for a moment before everyone forces themselves back into character, sure that their shock will end there.\n\n\nA minute passes, five remain, and the class is proven wrong as Katsuki Bakugou walks in. His head is down, shoulders drawn in, and for once the boy seems to have found his belt and his tie. His peers blink at how poorly the tie is done, surprised.\n\n\n\u201cExplains why he never wears a tie,\u201d Hagakure remarks, voice passive, and the class is surprised when Bakugou doesn\u2019t shout before remembering the goal of the day.\n\n\nTwo minutes pass, and only three remain. Tenya Iida walks in, looking displeased at being so \u2018late\u2019 even as he tries to relax. Sadly, the boy can\u2019t quite untense his shoulders as he shoots a wide smile at his peers before dropping into his seat.\u00a0\n\n\nAnother minute passes, and the class grows restless. No one is quite sure how to talk to their peers, because they can\u2019t quite tell who is who. A few are obvious, with Yaoyorozu as Mineta- the poor girl- and Kirishima as Satou, but too many are just acting shy and some are just smiling wider than usual. It\u2019s not much of a change.\n\n\nThe final minute passes, and the bell rings. Aizawa stands up, looking around.\n\n\n\u201cGood morning, students,\u201d Aizawa says, and that\u2019s all he gets a chance to say before the door slams open.\n\n\nAnd then Izuku Midoriya walks in, his normally bunched up, too short tie completely forgotten, shirt untucked and pants starting to sag. The class stares at him as he walks into the room without so much as a \u2018hello\u2019 or an explanation for his lateness, nonchalantly making his way to his desk.\n\n\nOr so they thought.\n\n\nMidoriya stops a desk too early, glaring at Bakugou with a look of open disdain that no one from 1-A has ever seen on his face before.\n\n\nAnd then he opens his mouth.\n\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing in my seat, shitty nerd?\u201d Midoriya asks, lips parted into a sneer that is far too similar to Bakugou\u2019s for his peers\u2019 liking. \u201cGet the fuck up, \n\nDeku\n\n.\u201d\n\n\nBakugou, apparently Midoriya, \n\nscrambles\n\n out of the spot, eyes wide and teary. \u201cR-right, Kacchan!\u201d He bows awkwardly before moving into Midoriya\u2019s normal spot, trembling even after Midoriya drops into the blond\u2019s seat, a smirk on his face.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cNo \n\nfucking\n\n way,\u201d Ashido whispers, accidentally breaking character, and Aizawa shoots a glare at her that shuts her right up.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cBakugou,\u201d Aizawa starts, and to 1-A\u2019s surprise Midoriya looks up without hesitation, but with a look that seems to try defying authority without words. \u201cTry not to be late next time.\u201d\n\n\nMidoriya rolls his eyes, and somehow the action is enough to further shake his peers. \u201cYeah, whatever. Let\u2019s just get started or something.\u201d He sounds bored, as if he\u2019s ready to just ditch class and go back to the dorms.\u00a0\n\n\nAizawa does, indeed, start class, brushing off Midoriya. The rest of the class slowly looks away from the greenet, and the day continues.\n\n\n-----\n\n\nThe day continues, but it\u2019s one of the most bizarre days that 1-A has ever faced, and perhaps ever will. If one were to ask the students what they considered the oddest moment, it\u2019s unclear what would be the final, definitive answer. Some considered their peers\u2019 entrances to be the most shocking, as it was the first impression they all got of one another- and some personalities were so different, they\u2019d be ingrained into their heads forever. Ashido would point to this moment, as Midoriya and Bakugou\u2019s interaction had shaken her to her very core.\n\n\nHowever, others may point to different moments of the day. Hagakure would point to English class, where Yamada-sensei freaked out upon hearing one of his favorite students- yet again, Midoriya- talk\u2026\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\u201cAlright, listeners!\u201d Yamada cheers, smacking his hand on the board with \n\nfar\n\n too much enthusiasm for a Monday morning. \u201cWho can tell me the correct way to arrange the following words?\u201d He gestures to the cluster of words that he\u2019s written, all in English of course. \u201cBonus points if you can explain \n\nwhy\n\n, of course!\u201d\n\n\nThe room is silent, each student trying to figure out how they\u2019re supposed to react. Ashido, for once, cringes as she realizes that she \n\nshould\n\n raise her hand, as she\u2019s Yaoyorozu...but she doesn\u2019t actually know the answer, which is quite un-Yaoyorozu like, in her opinion.\n\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, Iida practically vibrates in frustration, knowing that Kaminari never answers unless he absolutely \n\nhas\n\n too, and even then the answer is usually thrown together. It\u2019s rather frustrating, in his opinion, and Iida makes a mental note to talk to the electric boy about this issue...and then promptly wonders if making mental notes is breaking character or not.\n\n\nAs Ashido panics internally and Iida has a mental crisis that starts to edge towards \u2018mental breakdown\u2019 territory, Yamada decides to call on one of his favorite students, oblivious to the reaction he\u2019ll get.\n\n\n\u201cMidoriya!\u201d Yamada cheers, and doesn\u2019t notice how Bakugou glances up after a mere second of hesitation. \u201cWhat do you think it is, buddy?\u201d\n\n\nMidoriya slumps further into his seat, eyeing the board with obvious boredom as Bakugou makes a show of biting his lip, puffing out his cheeks in contemplation.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI, uh,\u201d Bakugou starts, but it\u2019s too soft and Yamada doesn\u2019t notice it.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cMidoriya?\u201d Yamada tries again, and his smile drops into a soft frown when Midoriya, once again, doesn\u2019t pay any mind to the teacher. \u201cListener, are you alright?\u201d\n\n\nHere, Midoriya \n\ndoes\n\n look up, but it\u2019s to roll his eyes and scoff. Yamada pauses at the noise, and opens his mouth to ask a question when Bakugou finally speaks up.\n\n\n\u201cSensei, the- the answer would be \u2018I will run with my friends on the Friday after next\u2019, right?\u201d Bakugou looks to Yamada with an obviously hesitant expression, and a few students have to hold back their laughter when they see the confused look on their teacher\u2019s face.\n\n\n\u201cAh, yes,\u201d Yamada says after a moment, nodding. \u201cThat\u2019s correct, Bakugou! Thanks for answering!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t fucking answer, but go off,\u201d Midoriya mutters under his breath, and those nearby do their best to hold in their laughter. Yamada blinks, looking at Midoriya with a concerned gaze.\n\n\n\u201cListener?\u201d Yamada asks, eyebrows creasing as he slowly asks, \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d\n\n\nMidoriya shrugs, the movement fluid and lazy. Raising his voice, he repeats, \u201cI didn\u2019t \n\nfucking\n\n answer, but go off.\u201d Lips twitching into a smirk, he asks, \u201cHappy now, \n\nsensei\n\n?\u201d\n\n\nYamada shakes his head slightly, lips curving downwards more and more with every passing second.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cBut I...I was talking to \n\nBakugou\n\n?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, I fucking \n\nknow\n\n,\u201d Midoriya snarks, and Yamada looks terrified at Midoriya\u2019s tone of voice.\n\n\n\u201cExcuse me for a moment, class,\u201d Yamada says, and then walks outside, shutting the door. This action does nothing to give him privacy, as the entire class easily hears as the man shouts, presumably into his phone, \u201c\n\nShouta\n\n! What the fresh \n\nfuck\n\n is happening to Midoriya today?\u201d A pause, then, \u201cHe\u2019s \n\nswearing\n\n, Sho! He \n\nnever\n\n swears! Did you break him?!\u201d\n\n\nInside of the classroom, Midoriya doesn\u2019t even bat an eye, instead leaning his head back and shutting his eyes, tuning out the world. He doesn\u2019t react when a clearly shaken Yamada returns, and the rest of the class is in awe at the boy\u2019s lack of reactions to Yamada\u2019s dramatic ones.\u00a0\n\n\n-----\n\n\nOf course, there are moments that \n\ndon\u2019t\n\n relate to Midoriya that are just as memorable. If one asked Jirou for her favorite part of the day, she\u2019d point to the many, \n\nmany\n\n times that Kirishima pulled out sugar at completely random times, only to chug the packets with a slight grimace, then proceed to act like he had gotten stronger. Aoyama adored every time that Kouda threw glitter, which usually happened after a teacher said something he liked, or during breaks between classes. Asui croaked out a laugh when Iida tried speaking in memes, only to utterly fail in his attempts, to the point that Kaminari broke character in order to give Iida a crash course in online humor.\u00a0\n\n\nSome students don\u2019t stand out much on their own, but definitely shine when next to the right person. Todoroki, for example, seemed to excel the most when banking off of Midoriya, complimenting the boy and actually smiling a few times. Tokoyami\u2019s character was only revealed when he followed Bakugou around, beak curving into a subtle smile as he muttered about how, \u201cyou\u2019re \n\nclearly\n\n All Might\u2019s child, Midoriya\u201d, which earned Tokoyami a quick scowl before Bakugou remembered himself, and instead gave a stuttered denial.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd, of course, there was the class that made and broke multiple students\u2019 impressions, and confirmed everyone\u2019s belief that Izuku Midoriya is a \n\nterrifying\n\n actor...\n\nFoundational Hero Training\n\n.\n\n\n----\n\n\nClass 1-A heads off to their Foundational Hero Training course at long last. The twenty students go to their locker rooms to change- with Uraraka having to throw Mineta into the boy\u2019s locker room before slamming the girl\u2019s door shut behind her- and everyone opens their cases without any further excitement.\n\n\nAnd then Midoriya lets out a shout.\n\n\n\u201cWho the \n\nfuck\n\n let me grab the wrong case?!\u201d Midoriya shouts, and everyone blinks in surprise, first at the swearing, then at his apparent mistake. Because Midoriya is holding case number eighteen, which...\n\nis\n\n his case.\n\n\n\u201cMidoribro, that\u2019s not the wrong one?\u201d Kirishima points out, confused, but then he lets out a squeak when Midoriya grabs him by the shirt and pulls him close.\n\n\n\u201cListen up, \n\nSugar High\n\n,\u201d Midoriya snarls, and someone snorts, \u201cI don\u2019t know who the \n\nhell\n\n you think you are, calling me by \n\nDeku\u2019s\n\n name, but this isn\u2019t my \n\nfucking\n\n costume!\u201d Unlatching it, he points to the green jumpsuit and says, \u201cLike I\u2019d wear a \n\nbunny suit\n\n.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nNone of the boys seem to know whether to laugh or cry at that. So they just stare at him as he turns on Bakugou, yanking the boy\u2019s case out of his hands before shoving his own in place of it. The blond in question glares at Midoriya for a moment, then quickly fixes his face into a pathetic frown before nodding, rushing to get into the costume.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAre...are we \n\nsupposed\n\n to swap outfits?\u201d Hanta asks, and gets a few shrugs in return.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI refuse to wear that cloak,\u201d Aoyama says bluntly, pointing at Tokoyami\u2019s outfit. \u201cThere\u2019s no shine.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I can fit into Kaminari- I mean, \n\nmy\n\n outfit!\u201d Iida says, awkwardly chopping his hand.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cBunch of wimps,\u201d Midoriya complains, and then he scowls as he pulls out the gauntlets that come with Bakugou\u2019s outfit.\u00a0\n\n\nBakugou looks over, eyes narrowing as he looks at the gear, his own hands holding the arm braces that Midoriya usually wears. The 1-A boys freeze, wondering if the two will break character over this. They...they wouldn\u2019t continue if it meant risking damage to themselves, would it?\n\n\nLuckily, Midoriya seems to have a way to get around the issue without letting up on the snarky personality. Scowl growing, he says, \u201cDeku, give me those stupid braces.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cY-yes, Kacchan,\u201d Bakugou replies, forcing the stutter as he holds out the requested pieces. In return, Midoriya shoves the gauntlets at Bakugou.\n\n\n\u201cYou can carry these around, maybe you\u2019ll be able to throw better hits after carrying the extra weight,\u201d Midoriya comments rudely, already pulling the braces on and stomping out of the locker room. Bakugou quickly follows. It\u2019s a rather odd sight, seeing Bakugou in a green jumpsuit that\u2019s a few inches too small, with his normal gauntlets and boots.\u00a0\n\n\nTodoroki blushes as he pulls on his own costume, and Kirishima looks at him oddly.\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up with you?\u201d Kirishima asks, and Todoroki avoids eye contact.\n\n\n\u201cMid- \n\nBakubro\n\n looks extra manly today,\u201d Todoroki gets out, and Kirishima laughs at the impression.\n\n\nAs it turns out, the girls have a similar reaction to the sight of Midoriya in the explosive teen\u2019s tank-top-including hero outfit. Midoriya, for his part, simply huffs and looks away, acting as if he\u2019s unaffected by the attention.\n\n\nAll Might blinks at the outfit, looking between Midoriya and Bakugou with quickly growing confusion.\n\n\n\u201cYoung Midoriya,\u201d All Might starts, and is promptly cut off by Bakugou\u2019s cheerful, \u201cYes, All Might?\u201d\n\n\nAll Might looks at Bakugou with apprehension, then rubs his eyes. \u201cYoung...Bakugou?\u201d He asks warily.\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you \n\nwant\n\n?\u201d Midoriya asks, and All Might actually takes a step back, much to the growing delight of 1-A.\n\n\n\u201cI...I may need to go see Recovery Girl,\u201d All Might admits to the class sheepishly. \u201cI do believe I\u2019ve hit my head on something.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNonsense, All Might!\u201d Uraraka shouts, chopping her hand through the air thoroughly. \u201cOur peers are simply doing an assignment, there is nothing to be concerned about!\u201d\n\n\nThis seems to bring relief to the hero, who chuckles awkwardly before finally starting the lesson.\n\n\nThings, of course, only go worse from there.\n\n\nMainly because All Might decides the day will be focused on \n\nsparring\n\n- specifically Quirk fights. Unfortunately, when All Might calls out for the pairs, he uses their real names...which means most of the students don\u2019t go where their teacher tells them to. A \n\nfew\n\n do, but that\u2019s only because they\u2019re set to fight one another...namely Sero and Ojirou, and, of course, Bakugou and Midoriya.\n\n\nAll Might has the bright idea to have everyone watch the individual matches, stating that they can all improve by seeing what their peers do correctly and incorrectly.\n\n\nWhich means that \n\neveryone \n\nsees the shitshow that promptly goes down the moment Bakugou and Midoriya\u2019s fight begins.\u00a0\n\n\nReally, with how spot on Midoriya has been all day, no one should have been surprised that Midoriya would change his fighting style to match Bakugou\u2019s. But despite this obvious leap, everyone was still stunned when \n\nMidoriya \n\ncharged forward immediately, starting with an infamous right hook.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Bakugou\u2019s opening move,\u201d Uraraka murmurs, eyes widening in awe as Bakugou leaps out of the way, clearly confused by the movement- and apparently irritated, if his narrowed eyes are anything to go by.\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s so \n\nmanly\n\n,\u201d Todoroki whispers when Midoriya dodges Bakugou\u2019s right hook, letting out a taunting, \u201cTryin\u2019 to copy me, shitty nerd? As if I\u2019m \n\nthat\n\n predictable.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh shit,\u201d Kaminari murmurs, once more breaking character. \u201cHe\u2019s \n\nroasting\n\n Bakugou.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t talk like that,\u201d Shouji murmurs through one of his extra limbs, then realizes his mistake and winces.\u00a0\n\n\nThe fight only devolves from there, Midoriya throwing out insults and goading Bakugou, riling up the blond as he effortlessly leads the fight. A few gasps can be heard when Midoriya mimics Bakugou\u2019s explosive \u2018flight\u2019 by flicking his fingers at the ground, using bursts of air to shoot himself above Bakugou in a precise motion that helps him land a solid hit on the blond.\n\n\n\u201cMotherfucker!\u201d Bakugou shouts, and Midoriya laughs.\n\n\n\u201cLook at that, the nerd has a mouth on him!\u201d Smiling cruelly, he says, \u201cAnd here I thought that was beat out of you \n\nyears\n\n ago.\u201d\n\n\nAnd everyone knows that the line is the killing blow when Bakugou freezes, only to restart with a shriek of rage and an explosive punch. Everyone winces, worried for Midoriya- only to be soothed when the boy easily pins Bakugou, knocking him to the ground.\n\n\n\u201cLooks like you\u2019re still below me, huh,\u201d Midoriya says, voice contemplative yet cocky, smirking cruelly. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised, you\u2019ve \n\nalways\n\n been a pebble underneath my feet.\u201d\n\n\nIn the blink of an eye, Midoriya is thrown off of Bakugou, the blond shoving the greenet to the floor before storming off, leaving Midoriya on the ground.\n\n\nAs Bakugou stomps away, screaming incoherently, All Might can only turn to Midoriya with a concerned expression.\n\n\n\u201cAre you quite alright, my boy?\u201d All Might asks, and the class watches on as Midoriya turns to him with a sneer.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not \n\nyour boy\n\n,\u201d Midoriya snarls, teeth exposed, and then scoffs as he pulls himself off of the ground. \u201cAs if I\u2019d ever be related to \n\nyou\n\n.\u201d\n\n\nUraraka can\u2019t help but break character in order to console the Number One Hero, who, despite knowing that Midoriya and Bakugou have \u2018swapped\u2019 personalities, seems hurt by the words.\n\n\n(All Might would later admit to Midoriya that he had, indeed, been wounded by the scathing insults, to which Midoriya would apologize with an overabundance of tears.)\n\n\nMidoriya, for his part, just stomps away from the sad hero, angrily muttering about how \u2018stupid Deku tried to impersonate me\u2019.\n\n\nAs if on cue, the bell rings, ending the period. Awkwardly, the rest of 1-A heads back to the changing rooms, then to their classroom, wondering what their teacher will say upon their return.\n\n\n-----\n\n\nAizawa sighs as he looks over his notes, observations he\u2019d noticed and comments he\u2019d received from his coworkers written down for him to factor into his students\u2019 final scores for the day. Glancing up, he scans his twenty students- all of whom currently work silently- and recalls what he\u2019s seen and heard.\n\n\nMost did well. It was a fun activity, he supposes, so it makes sense. Of course, most of them had flaws in their performances.\n\n\nSome, like Ashido, had an unfortunate habit of breaking character- especially when they thought they wouldn\u2019t be noticed. The morning was especially bad, as it was obvious that the early students had assumed he was \n\nactually\n\n asleep- as if he\u2019d miss their first attempts at acting as someone else. He\u2019ll have to talk to those students, make sure they understand that the moments where they think they\u2019re safe are the most dangerous ones, as that\u2019s when an enemy can get the jump on them.\n\n\nThen there are those like Todoroki, who didn\u2019t quite act well enough. Sure, Todoroki said all of the right phrases, and even stuck to the right \u2018friends\u2019, once he knew who was supposed to be who for the most part, but the emotion was nonexistent. Words and actions aren\u2019t always enough, emotions- fake or not- are also part of the equation when it comes to personas.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd, of course, there are those who reduced their assigned classmates to one-off jokes or vague representations. While Kirishima\u2019s random consumptions of sugar \n\ndid\n\n clarify who he was, Satou is much more than that. Hell, if Kirishima had just mentioned a new episode for some random baking show, he would have been much better off than he is now, having downed at \n\nleast\n\n thirty packets of sugar.\u00a0\n\n\nFinally, there are those who cracked after seeing how they were portrayed...like Bakugou. Which, in the blond\u2019s case, is quite disappointing, because Bakugou had been doing quite well. The boy had been nearly flawless in his execution of Midoriya\u2019s little ticks and actions, from the stuttering to the poorly done tie. If their sparring match hadn\u2019t been against one another, and Bakugou hadn\u2019t seen how Midoriya had immediately copied his fighting style- which Aizawa will get back to, because that...that was \n\nimpressive, \n\ndare he think it- he likely would have gone the entire day without folding. He would have been competing with Midoriya for the perfect score, but instead Aizawa has to dock off some points for that final reaction.\n\n\nWhich brings Aizawa to the \n\none\n\n student who did perfectly. Izuku Midoriya, set up to be Katsuki Bakugou.\u00a0\n\n\nTo be quite honest, Aizawa hadn\u2019t expected Midoriya to do so well. Midoriya is a rather timid boy, most of the time, always flinching away from sudden movements and questioning himself. But apparently, \u2018most of the time\u2019 doesn\u2019t include when Midoriya has to act, because Midoriya had come in, metaphorical guns blazing, going so far as to be late in order to make a grand entrance. From there, Midoriya had acted just like his peer, from the cursing to the casual, slouched posture that Bakugou always has.\u00a0\n\n\n\u2018\n\nDoesn\u2019t Midoriya have an analysis notebook?\n\n\u2019 Aizawa wonders, recalling a few mentions of the thing. He\u2019s pretty sure that it\u2019s about Quirks, but Aizawa wouldn\u2019t be surprised to hear that it\u2019s got more than just that by now. And considering Midoriya has known Bakugou for years, the two coming from the same middle school, and likely the same elementary school as well...well, if Midoriya has been analyzing for that long, it\u2019s not \n\ntoo\n\n big of a stretch to see how Midoriya was able to copy the boy so perfectly.\n\n\n(Although a part of Aizawa is concerned about what apparently happened at the end of the fight. Midoriya\u2019s comments are...worrying, to say the least. He\u2019ll have to talk with the boy soon, but that\u2019s for another day.)\n\n\n\u2018\n\nAt least he scared the shit out of Hizashi,\n\n\u2019 Aizawa thinks with a smirk. Nodding to himself, Aizawa gives Midoriya all three prizes- the perfect score, extra credit, and a note that he has a free pass to get out of any assignment he wants. Aizawa doubts that the boy will actually \n\nuse\n\n it, but he\u2019s earned it. Acting like Bakugou must have been tough, straying so far away from his own nature and having to face the surprised reactions of his teachers without so much as flinching.\u00a0\n\n\nActually...Aizawa wonders how Midoriya would fare, acting as someone \n\nnewer\n\n to him. With Bakugou, the boy has had years to study his person...what if he\u2019s only known the subject of choice for \n\nmonths\n\n, and doesn\u2019t see them out of school?\n\n\n\u201cMidoriya,\u201d Aizawa calls out, just as the bell rings. With the day ending, the problem child finally listens to the sound of his actual name, perking up. \u201cStay after for a moment, will you?\u201d\n\n\nMidoriya nods, and Aizawa watches as the class empties out. It\u2019s only when the two of them are remaining that Aizawa smirks and asks, \u201cMidoriya, how would you like to impersonate someone else for tomorrow?\u201d\n\n\nMidoriya\u2019s eyes spark with anticipation, a question falling from his lips automatically. \u201cWho would it be, sensei?\u201d Midoriya asks, and Aizawa hums.\n\n\n\u201cMyself,\u201d Aizawa answers, and Midoriya\u2019s shaky smile quickly turns into a wide grin.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be honored,\u201d Midoriya says, and Aizawa finds himself mirroring the boy\u2019s expression.\n\n\n\u201cPerfect,\u201d Aizawa says, and internally he thinks, \u2018\n\nI can\u2019t wait to see how this goes\u2026\n\n\u2019\n\n\n-----\n\n\nIt goes wonderfully. Aizawa has to hide his smirk when Midoriya walks into class seconds before the bell, a mug of coffee in his hand and a spare capture weapon wrapped around his neck- which Aizawa didn\u2019t even \n\ngive \n\nhim, how did Midoriya get that?-, with a tired expression worn into his face.\u00a0\n\n\nInstantly, the silence is replaced with a multitude of questions, the rest of 1-A trying to understand this change of events. Midoriya glares at the class, and Aizawa almost chokes because Midoriya\u2019s eyes seem to glint and darken despite the boy \n\nnot having a Quirk to do that\n\n.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cSilence, or you\u2019re out,\u201d Midoriya says, and the room falls quiet. Well, except for one.\n\n\n\u201cWhy do \n\nyou\n\n get to dress up again?\u201d Mineta asks, and Midoriya sighs and points to the door.\n\n\n\u201cGet out,\u201d Midoriya says. \u201cYou\u2019re expelled.\u201d\n\n\nAs the class devolves into pandemonium once again, Aizawa decides that he\u2019s completely okay with his decisions.\n\n\n\u2018\n\nMaybe next time, they\u2019ll listen to my goddamn lecture,\n\n\u2019 Aizawa thinks, and if he chuckles, only one green-haired boy actually catches it.\n\n\nAnd that is quite alright.\n"
