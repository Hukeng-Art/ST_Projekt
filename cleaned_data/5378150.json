    "text": "He had just been trying to lighten the mood a little. It had started like this:\n\"I have a game we can play.\"\nFrom his left, Ladybug groans. Though his gaze had settled over the city of Paris, cast now in the pinks and purples of the twilight sky, Chat still knows his Lady was rolling her eyes.\n\"I don't want to play any of your games, Chat.\"\nIt's the answer he's expecting, but he can tell his plan is already working. There's a curiosity resting on the edges of her words, a lilt that tells him she's more interested than she'd letting on. \n\u201cSurely My Lady isn\u2019t afraid of losing to this lowly alley cat?\u201d he presses. \nChat turns to her and raises one eyebrow dramatically. He\u2019s able to duck away from the swat she aims towards the side of his head, but he\u2019s completely incapable of ignoring the hot twist in his gut when Ladybug lets loose a laugh at his antics. \nLaughter had been scarce their last few meetings. While he had no idea what life was like for the girl on the other side of the spotted mask, the slump of her shoulders when they met to patrol and the weary sighs that escaped her lips once the thrill of a successful akuma cleansing had cooled told him that all was not well. She\u2019d seemed tired, and distant, and Chat knew he had been little better. School was becoming more demanding, photoshoots and runway appearances more frequent, and akuma attacks more direct. They were up to three attacks a week, on average, with one awful week maxing out at six. Almost always someone he knew. As much as he loved every moment spent saving the city with Ladybug, it was getting harder to enjoy when it meant hours of aching bones and blearily half-completed homework afterwards. He was getting tired of fighting his friends. \n\u201cPlease,\u201d she says with a snort, \u201cIt\u2019s almost not worth playing when we both know I\u2019ll sweep the floor with your fuzzy behind.\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds like something someone afraid of losing would say,\u201d he teases. He delights in the indignant flush that lights up the skin along the edges of her mask. Ladybug\u2019s cheeks puff out; his heart stammers in his chest.\n\u201cAre you calling me\u2026 a scaredy cat?\u201d\nChat could kiss her. Truth be told, it doesn\u2019t take much for him to feel that way, but there\u2019s something irresistible about the way her lips quirk up when she turns his awful jokes back on him.\n\u201cMe? Call you a scaredy cat? That\u2019s something I would never do on purrpose, My Lady.\u201d\nThis time he lets her land the light smack on his shoulder; the ensuing giggle is worth it. Ladybug pulls her legs up from where she\u2019d been letting them dangle over the edge of the roof and turns to face him. She crosses her arms over her chest, and dieu did the challenge sparking behind her electrifyingly blue eyes send a jolt to his system. \n\u201cFine. What\u2019s this game of yours? It doesn\u2019t involve little mouse toys or string, does it Chaton?\u201d\nI wouldn\u2019t play any game with you and string in public he thinks, and Chat\u2019s glad he has the sense to chew the words back before he makes a fool of himself, because really, did that even make sense? \nHe settles for a purred, \u201cNot this time,\u201d and swings his legs back onto the roof. Chat crosses them and turns to face her - their knees brush. \n\u201cThe game\u2019s simple: two truths and a lie. Each of us will tell the other person three things. Then the other person will say if they\u2019re right or not. Whoever gets the most right, wins.\u201d\nLadybug tenses, ready to pull away. A frown graces her features.\n\u201cYou know how I feel about discussing our\u2026 other lives.\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn't have to be about anything like that,\u201d he says hurriedly. He places a hand on her knee, as if that would really keep her there should she change her mind. His Lady was nothing if not a force of her own. \n\u201cIt\u2019s bound to be personal,\u201d Ladybug argues. She neatly sweeps his hand away and begins to stand. Her reaction was far from what he\u2019s intended, and he scrambles to fix it.\n\u201cI loathe Camembert cheese,\u201d he starts, \u201cand I\u2019m allergic to feathers. My favorite color is green.\u201d \nCuriosity killed the cat, he thinks. Ladybug hovers, no longer sitting, not fully upright. Her eyes scan his face, then flick upwards. Whether she realizes it or not, she nibbles lightly on her bottom lip.\n\u201cThe last one is the lie,\u201d she says slowly. \nSatisfaction brought it back, he finishes. It\u2019s difficult to keep his expression cool: Chat loves when he\u2019s right about his partner-in-not-crime. Done thinking it through, Ladybug\u2019s eyes refocus and slide back to him. Waiting.\n\u201cAbsolutely correct, My Lady. How\u2019d you know?\u201d\nLadybug sits back down, and a smile flickers across her face. \n\u201cYou made it obvious. I already knew about the feathers from Monsieur Pigeon, and over the summer you\u2019d mentioned how mad you were over Plagg leaving a wedge of Camembert in your pocket and it melting over your stuff. I think you said something like \u2018If I never saw another piece of Camembert again, that would be the happiest day of my life.\u2019\u201d\nShe rolls her eyes, likely reliving his hyperbole. \u201cBut it\u2019s obvious even without that,\u201d Ladybug continues, \u201cYou like green, and probably wear it a lot, because it\u2019s a flattering color for your complexion - skin and hair and all. But it\u2019s not your favorite color. You only wear it all of the time because other people like it on you, and you always give in when it comes to things you think people like.\u201d\nChat\u2019s jaw drops, leaving him looking for all the world like a fish trying to gulp in air. \n\u201cI-\u201d he starts, but the words fail him, bad luck. \u201cI think it\u2019s your turn.\u201d\nThe lingering look Ladybug leaves him makes it clear that his avoidance of her words hasn't gone unnoticed, but he thinks the game might be compelling enough for her to drop it. Her gaze slides back to the sky - darkening now, and spots of stars peeking out - and gently lifts a finger to her lips.\nShe\u2019s quiet for the next minute, and Chat wonders what will come out. What little he\u2019s learned of her has been through inattention or accident: she goes to a local lycee, they\u2019re around the same age, it is her mother who is Chinese. She has a crush on someone from her school. She\u2019s achingly insecure about her Miraculous-less self. \n\u201cI like fairy tales best, I have a younger brother, and my favorite color is pink,\u201d she finally says. She still avoids his stare; she still looks nervous.\nIt strikes him, how instantly he seems to know the answer. For as little as they\u2019d shared, how long had they been together? It was impossible not to know the person he fought beside for over a year.\n\u201cYou don't have any other siblings,\u201d Chat says decisively. \nLadybug\u2019s look of surprise melts into a smile. If he had a kiss for every time she rolled her eyes at him\u2026 \n\n\n\u201cI am the best at this game, non?\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah, yeah, you got it right,\u201d she says, flapping a hand at him dismissively, \u201cCare to explain your sudden stroke of genius?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPlease, I am always this brilliant,\u201d Chat purrs. He leans forward, resting his hands on her shoulders, and whispers conspiratorially, \u201cWhenever children are in danger from an akuma attack, you always hesitate, just for a second, before picking them up. It\u2019s not because you don't want to rescue them - it\u2019s more like you're figuring out how to haul them off without hurting them or something. If you had a younger sibling, you\u2019d be so used to scooping them up that there would be no delay, no question.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nHer eyebrows raise far over the top of her mask - if he had to read her expression, he would say impressed. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2026 is pretty brilliant,\u201d she admits, \u201cI\u2019d never noticed that myself.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI only ever noticed because I do the exact same thing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nChat knows she\u2019ll document that tidbit. Unlike her, he\u2019s been dropping hints about himself from the start. As time passes, the clues feel more like breadcrumbs laid out with intention; it\u2019s all he can do not to grab her by the shoulders and shout \u2018Follow the trail! Find me!\u2019 (or, when he\u2019s feeling low, more like now, \u2018I'm alone at the other end of this, and so are you. Please, let\u2019s meet in the middle.\u2019).\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYour turn.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nFor nearly twenty minutes they meander through each other's lives. Ladybug proves more willing with each round to reveal a fraction more about herself - Chat can't tell if it's a function of the game, lowering her defenses, or if all of that resistance she\u2019d offered for so long wasn't more of a strain on her than she\u2019d really wanted. Regardless, he commit each detail, every implication, to memory: she preferred tea to coffee (he\u2019d gotten that one wrong); she was interested in fashion and design; she never read the Ladyblog unless she had to (he confessed he had every update sent to his phone - Chat Noir would never miss an opportunity to see his Ladybug - and let her laugh over his blush); she made incredible macarons. Most surprisingly, Ladybug personally knew the girl who ran the Ladyblog, though she had no clue. He wants to say he knows Alya too, that maybe they do know each other, but he refuses to risk ruining the good luck he\u2019s had in the game.\n\n\n\n\nIn turn, he proved there was still some mystery behind the mask. She\u2019d guessed incorrectly when he told her he had a large extended family (\u2018I can\u2019t believe it, you\u2019re so over the top, you had to be fighting for attention from cousins!\u2019. Chat keeps the cold, empty halls of his father\u2019s mansion to himself), and while Ladybug had gotten his prestigious, well-off upbringing right, she\u2019d seemed surprised when he confirmed it. The tinkling giggle she let loose when he went into an in-depth description of formal place settings had been worth the memory of his father, scolding him over a misplaced salad fork. \n\n\n\n\nStreetlights below suddenly flicker to life, warming the streets with their orange glow. Chat would like to think they spark to attention for her, as her laugh had done the same to him countless times before. Paris erupts into brightness all around them, and Chat barely contains a gasp. It had been too long since the City of Lights had taken his breath away, but in this moment it dawns on him that it is as much the girl at his side as the city below. Chat stares at her and smiles. It\u2019s his turn.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI am in love with the most incredible girl,\u201d he says, softly, \u201cI have never met someone more beautiful, and becoming Chat Noir and meeting Ladybug is the best thing that has ever happened to me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nSitting there on the edge of the roof, knees touching, leaning in to one another, high above the tranquilly bustling city, seems like the perfect moment to confess, and so he does. There\u2019s no way it comes as a surprise to her, but he\u2019s never managed to string all of the words together. The last time he\u2019d tried had been St. Valentin\u2019s, and had ended poorly. \n\n\n\n\nHe\u2019s ready for rejection. As playfully as she\u2019d rebuked his advances before, he knows. He\u2019s even prepared to be laughed at, swatted off, turned away with the delicate flush of cheeks only Ladybug can seem to produce. A minuscule part of him - the Adrien part, the hopeless romantic - is even ready for her to lean in, close the distance between them, say yes.\n\n\n\n\nWhat Chat is not ready for is the way Ladybug deflates. Without warning she buries her face in her hands and bows her head. Shoulders hunch forward, knees jerk up to her chest - she\u2019s curled in on herself. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the way the game is played, Chat,\u201d she says. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cI know, ma cherie,\u201d Chat says, \u201cI cheated and told three truths instead.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nBut that's not what she wants to hear either; her fingers tangle up into her hair and she tugs miserably. He still can't see her face, but the gesture strikes him as so familiar it almost gives him pause. The thought is swept aside when Ladybug speaks.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe boy I like barely knows that I exist. I\u2019m not good enough for the affection of my partner, the only person who knows about this side of my life, the only person I can truly trust. Becoming Ladybug has never made me happier or confused me more.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nEach word hits like a bullet. \n\n\n\n\nHe doesn't want to hear the muffled sob in her voice, but there it is. He doesn't want to hear the conflict, doesn't want to hear about another man, doesn't want to hear the promise, the implication in her last statements. Chat reaches out to her. He starts for her shoulder then, second-guessing himself, ends up settling once more for her knee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the way the game is played, Ladybug. It\u2019s called two truths and a lie, not three very obvious lies.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChat\u2019s brain plays a quick game of connect-the-Ladybug-spots: he doesn\u2019t like the picture he sees, but the weariness, the sighs, the weeks of exhaustion and unhappiness in his partner suddenly come together. Before, he\u2019d blamed school and the work, but never would he have thought that her feelings for him, clearly at odds with her attraction to this other boy, had been the root of her gloom. The longer he thinks on it though, the more his heart seems to beat back his own despondency. He might just have a chance. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBesides,\u201d he continues, \u201cWho would be foolish enough not to notice you?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHer answer is mumbled but unmistakable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAdrien Agreste. And he\u2019s not a fool, I am.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHis hands slide from her knees. Face still obscured, Ladybug doesn\u2019t see the way his eyes widen, or how he covers his mouth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve heard of him, I\u2019m guessing,\u201d Ladybug says, \u201cHe goes to my school. I\u2019ve sat behind him in class almost every day for the last year, and still, I can\u2019t get one coherent sentence out around him.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut that means-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI thought maybe it\u2019d get easier, once, well, you know-\u201d she peels a hand from her face and gestures vaguely at him, and no, he does not know what she means by that, \u201cbut I\u2019m useless when I\u2019m not Ladybug.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat Ladybug-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHer other hand leaves her face, giving him no time to school his expression. Ladybug sees the look on his face and chuckles humorlessly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI know it must come as a shock, but it\u2019s true. I\u2019ve never wanted you to know who I am when I\u2019m not Ladybug, because that girl is so pathetic, so\u2026 worthless that you\u2019d be embarrassed if you actually knew her.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe black hair. Those blue eyes. A love of pink. Knows Alya. Sits behind him in class. He struggles to register that she\u2019s still talking; his head seems full to bursting as the pieces swirl together. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLadybug leans back, propping herself up to stare at the sky. The motion catches his attention - he has to focus, because what she says next is going to be important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTake, for example, Adrien\u2019s last birthday. I made a scarf for him. Saved up every bit of my allowance for the right kind of yarn and spent days making sure it was right. I must have unravelled and re-knit that scarf four times before it was perfect.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe thought he\u2019d been hit before, that her words had taken a large enough bite out of him that he\u2019d be fine with anything else. But then there\u2019s a blue cashmere scarf, soft and fine, tucked under his pillow - a gift from his father. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd then I clammed up. Tried to give him the gift and instead freaked out and made an idiot of myself. So then I delivered it to his house, but forgot to sign my name - an idiot, again - and then snuck back in to sign the gift, but then Nino became possessed by an akuma and well, you were there for that, and then- and then the very next day, Adrien shows up to school. Wearing the scarf I had made him.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChat doesn\u2019t want her to look back at him, because surely she\u2019d read everything there: the confusion, the understanding, the hurt he knows she\u2019d misinterpret. Ladybug lets out a sharp huff, sounding less tearful and more annoyed with herself. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHe said it had been a gift from his father, that it was the best gift he\u2019d ever gotten from him. And Adrien just smiled. I\u2019d never seen him like that before, and I caved. I couldn\u2019t tell him. It made me so happy to see him smile like that. I couldn\u2019t ruin it for him. But maybe if I\u2019d said something\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLadybug groans and shakes her head. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis whole time- and his father-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd I can\u2019t ruin this for you. This person you think I am, this person you lo- care about so much. She\u2019s the one you deserve. She\u2019s the one who has taken too long to realize just how\u2026 miraculous you are.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStraightening, she levels Chat with a look somewhere between amused and heartbroken. Her eyes are too blue, too easy to read, and he wonders how he didn\u2019t see it before. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis was a stupid game, Chat.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt had started out as a game, really. Just a little something to lighten the deep hue of melancholy they\u2019d both been painted in. Facile.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd it wasn't like he\u2019d planned on letting that cat out of the bag; it was more like he\u2019d opened the bag expecting a treat and instead found that drenched and hissing beast at the bottom. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cChat?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny other moment would have found him shuddering in delight at the honey-laced worry of his name on her lips. Tonight, the shudder that trips down his spine is ignorant of the girl who leans in and places a red-clad hand on his shoulder. On the narrow ledge of the roof he can feel the heat of her body. He stands. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat is it? Cat got your tongue?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe frantic note in her voice undermines the joke. She too stands and peers up at him, trying to catch his gaze. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe thinks he manages a choked \u201cI'm fine,\u201d before he turns and launches himself over to the next rooftop, but he\u2019s not entirely sure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the next morning, Adrien\u2019s feelings had settled from an angry yowl to an agitated flick of the tail - metaphorically speaking. Plagg didn\u2019t push him, didn\u2019t say much at all. Were he not so wrapped up in his own head, Adrien might have noticed just how strangely subdued the kwami chose to act. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly once the night before did Plagg intrude into his thoughts. The little kwami, who tended to spend his nights buried in a pile of Adrien\u2019s clothes (they smelled like cheese!) or floating just above his head, instead tucked himself onto Adrien\u2019s pillow, right against his cheek. The space had been devoid of warmth or weight, empty of the scarf he normally slept with. It felt better with Plagg there, though his presence seemed to highlight its absence. Abandoned to the floor, the scarf huddled in a sad, limp pile. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou realize this means she likes both of you? Or all of you, I guess. Or maybe it means she likes you and me...\u201d Plagg muses quietly. His small body hums against Adrien's cheek. It's a small comfort, to know there is at least one person (or creature) who will always be there for him. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first half of the next day was agony bundled in a blanket of misery. Truly, the only thing miraculous about it was that Adrien didn\u2019t keel over and die before lunch. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite having never spent much time regarding the girl who sat behind him, Adrien was aware from the moment she stepped through the door that something was wrong. Marinette\u2019s greeting, normally cheerful if not incomprehensible through her nervous stammering, came to him flat and fluid. The simplest realization that Marinette always said good morning to him, and that he'd never registered the habit before floored him. Did he always return the kindness? Or had he just replied in automatic politeness? How many days had she greeted him only to find him distracted, likely thinking of Ladybug, to the point that he didn't respond? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlagg must feel him tense - a moment later he delivers a sharp pinch right under Adrien\u2019s collar. It snaps him out of his dizzying thoughts long enough to pipe up with a high-pitched, \u201cGood morning, Marinette.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShe jumps a little at his response and nearly drops her bag. Marinette recovers quickly, sliding into the seat behind him. Papers rustle as she digs through her bag. It\u2019s evident she doesn\u2019t expect further conversation from him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe boy I like barely knows that I exist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDid you, uh, have a nice evening yesterday?\u201d Adrien asks. In an instant he\u2019s cursing himself - what a stupid, bland question to ask, what a way to try too hard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking up, Marinette furrows her brows. How often had he seen that exact expression from behind a red and black mask? Adrien fights the urge to slink out of the classroom, alley cat that he is. There is next to no way he doesn\u2019t botch everything.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was fine,\u201d she says slowly. No stammer interrupts her words, and she sounds so much like his lady that it hurts. How much sooner would be have figured it out if she'd been able to string together a normal conversation with him before?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPapa made me work for a few hours after school, which I wouldn't mind if I weren't always on the register and were in the kitchen instead. I met up with a friend but\u2026\u201d she pauses to bite her bottom lip. For an entire year, he\u2019d been blind. \u201cBut I think we got into a fight.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cFriend? Fight? I know you two aren\u2019t talking about me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRambunctious as always, Alya slides right into her seat and the conversation with a grin. Her chin plops down on her hand and she looks from Adrien to Marinette with big, delighted eyes. Marinette lets out a startled laugh, while Adrien merely blinks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYes, Alya,\u201d Marinette says once she\u2019s recovered, \u201cYou. Me. Alley behind the building. A fight to the death!\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey roll their eyes at each other, synchronized. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNot everything is about you-\u201d Marinette continues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWell it should be-\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBut I was talking about, well, you know before you so rudely interjected.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdrien is certain he\u2019s been dropped from the girls\u2019 conversation until Alya looks over a moment later and smirks. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOur little Marinette has a mysterious male acquaintance that she keeps spending all of her time with. Apparently he goes to \u2018another school\u2019 and \u2018nobody knows him\u2019. I haven\u2019t met him, but according to Mari they\u2019re \u2018mostly just friends\u2019.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlya puts air quotes around the last part and watches Adrien\u2019s reaction with a keen eye. Marinette tucks her face into her hands, moaning something about how embarrassing her friend is. It\u2019s the longest conversation he\u2019s been involved in with Marinette (as Marinette), but he feels a ripple of blistering jealousy at the mention of this friend of hers. The jealous feelings only half make sense - he\u2019d only ever half known her, after all. But they make even less sense when Adrien puts Marinette\u2019s words and his own night together and realizes that, if he\u2019s right, he is the mysterious friend in question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdrien is saved from his thoughts and any further idiocy by the appearance of the teacher, bringing along with her the first bell of a very long day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe should have just stayed home, for all school was wasted on him. But home would mean no Marinette, and no Marinette would mean no answers, and he\u2019s not about to let himself chase his own tail over that. But where does he start? Pry and charm out information until every suspicion is confirmed (or worse, denied)? Confront her head on, regardless of the risks? Adrien and Chat circle the same mouse, yet can\u2019t agree on when to pounce. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s no clear answer, and the very presence of Marinette at his back all morning further muddies the water. Chat Noir\u2019s enhanced hearing isn\u2019t necessary to note each time she shifts in her chair or lets loose a quiet sigh. Hyper-aware, Adrien almost startles out of his skin when Marinette taps him on his shoulder and smoothly asks him if he could grab the pencil she\u2019d dropped on accident. His hold on the pencil lingers as she thanks him and grabs it, and he lets himself stare a few moments longer than might be deemed acceptable. Marinette must notice, given the way she blushes and looks away. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlan A is to go to the source itself. Fifteen minutes before class is released for lunch, Adrien begins to prepare himself. Breathe. Think of what you\u2019re going to say. Don\u2019t freak out, and don\u2019t freak her out. The mantra beats a tattoo in his brain that matches the quake of his heart. As focused as he is on not panicking the moment the bell rings, he does not hear the bell ring. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the time the ebb of students alerts him to the start of the lunch hour, someone else has already come to Marinette\u2019s desk. Adrien turns to see Juleka, tears welling at the corners of her eyes, begging Marinette for help. He tries to say something - anything - to get Marinette\u2019s attention, maybe to ask if she wanted to eat lunch together when she was done sewing the obvious gash in Juleka\u2019s skirt, but his words drown in the warm waters of the soft smile she gives the other girl. Marinette is gone in an instant, guiding Juleka by the shoulder. So much for Plan A. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlan B. Plan B will be easier. Adrien takes a deep breath and coaxes his mouth into action. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHey Alya - have a minute?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow the girl managed to eat her lunch, update her blog, and complete her homework for her afternoon class all at the same time remained one of the major mysteries of the universe. Currently, half a sandwich hung from Alya\u2019s mouth as she tapped out a paragraph for the infamous Ladyblog on her phone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2018Eah, whaffup?\u201d she said through her food.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeep breath. Like yanking off a bandaid. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201ci just had a quick question. You know that blue scarf I wear?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe flustered expression that rose to her face answered the question he hadn\u2019t yet asked. Alya swallowed hard. Part of her sandwich caught in her throat, launching her into a coughing fit and Adrien into a mild panic. A few thumps on the back and a hurried apology later, Alya draws in a deep breath and answers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d she says, \u201cYou got it for your birthday, right?\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cLast year. It was from my dad.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe watches her reaction carefully. It\u2019s a stroke of irregular good luck that Alya has such a terrible poker face; were she ever to discover Ladybug\u2019s identity, there would be no chance of it remaining a secret. It\u2019s a good thing she has no clue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt must be nice, with the weather getting cold soon,\u201d Alya says, trying to keep her voice neutral. There\u2019s still a rising tone there, a clutch of nervousness in her voice that mirrors the widening of her eyes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \"It is nice, it's one of the nicest gifts I've ever gotten.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That's great!\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShe looks strained now, eyes shifting to avoid his gaze.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Alya?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Adrien?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Did Marinette make it?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlya is fortunate she'd put her sandwich down after their conversation began in earnest, as it's clear she would have choked on it once more. Her face flares, matching the red of her hair in seconds. There's some spluttering, frantic sounds that make their way through her lips - Adrien has never seen Alya act so much like her best friend than in that instant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Alya.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShe can't look at him. She tries, once, but her eyes dart away. Her fingers toy at the wrapper of her sandwich. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"She did,\" Alya finally breathes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven though at his core he'd known it, the revelation doesn't make the ache that hits his chest any softer. Standing upright on solid ground, the breath evacuates Adrien's chest like it's been punched away by the force of a hard fall. He stares down at Alya, who peeks back up at him from under her bangs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Why- why didn't she-?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut he can't finish the question, because the moment he tries to pull air back into his lungs, Adrien finds his heart jumpstarted into the midst of a marathon, and its relentless palpitations are painful. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Marinette made it for your birthday last year,\" Alya says. \"She wanted to give it to you in person, but she becomes the human equivalent of Jell-O whenever someone so much as breathes your name.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat should be news, if it means what he thinks it means, but right now it just feels like more debris swept into the hurricane of his confusion. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So after school we went to your house so that she could deliver it to you. She left it in that weird delivery box outside of your house, but Mari forgot to sign the tag on it - what a mess. She went all the way back just to fix it, but I guess it didn't matter. The next day, you were showing off your scarf to Nino, and you mentioned it had been a gift from your father and, well...\" Alya trails off, a bitter smile playing on her lips, \"It was obvious what happened. But it was also obvious how happy the whole thing had made you... when Marinette saw that, she decided not to tell you.\" Alya looks up at him. Her mouth firms into a frown and her brows furrow just so. \"She's amazing like that,\" she continues, her sharp tone a clear warning of what could happen if he disagreed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's a mute nod. He puts a hand to his temple, pounding, then fidgets to pull out his phone, changes his mind, and puts his hands back to his head. He's distinctly aware of the weight of each breath he takes, and how his breathing seems to be accelerating to match his racing pulse. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Adrien? Are you... are you okay?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I- I'm fine,\" he says, but he can hear how distraught he sounds. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlya's expression softens, though she sounds wary when she asks, \"Are you mad?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe thinks about it, if thinking is what the chaotic spin of words and feelings sweeping along his brain can be called.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Mad, no. Upset, yes.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's back in an instant, Alya's sharp defensiveness, but this time there's a fire to it. \"You'd better not blame this on Marinette,\" she snaps, \"All she wanted was for you to be happy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt made me so happy to see him smile like that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdrien groans, letting his head slip to the desk. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm not,\" he says, voice muffled, \"I'm not upset with Marinette.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's not entirely true, but it's not entirely false, either.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlagg might still be tucked in the inside pocket if his undershirt, but it is nonetheless Chat who rears his angry head the moment Adrien steps foot in the Agreste mansion. Where to direct his rage is still uncertain. Nathalie for lying to him? Ladybug, for taking the comfort of his most precious gift and rendering it useless? Marinette, for refusing to stand up for herself? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it hits him again that Ladybug and Marinette are the same person, and the new burst of anger sits lower in his gut, burns hotter, because this whole time, they could have been-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonths of Chat Noir pining over Ladybug, and Marinette swooning for Adrien, both of them too buried in their own feelings to see the person right beside them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdrien is, above all, livid with himself, but Nathalie makes the unknowing mistake of stepping into the hallway in front of him, and the claws immediately come out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNathalie,\u201d he snaps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s rumble of satisfaction in his chest when she startles to attention - a reaction he\u2019s only ever seen his father provoke. She glances up from her tablet, confirming that it is indeed not Gabriel Agreste before her. Yet Nathalie does not relax once she sees the displeasure on Adrien\u2019s face. In one hand is clutched the blue scarf she\u2019d delivered to him on his birthday months ago. Dark eyes move to the scarf, then back up to his face. Just like with Alya, Nathalie\u2019s strained expression confirms everything he\u2019s heard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAdrien?\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe has to admire how even her voice remains. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAt my last birthday, you brought me this as a present.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI did.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd you told me it came from my father.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHer mouth tightens to a fine line. She raises her tablet, ready to dismiss him. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI did. Now, if you\u2019re done recounting basic fact-\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo finally speak is to break the spell. Any last vestiges of magic in a blue scarf, swept away. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou lied to me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNathalie sighs and pinches the bridge of her nose. Some small bubble of vexation in his chest deflates. So that\u2019s it. Not much else to be done. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAdrien, it was almost a year ago,\u201d she starts, \u201cand you should be aware by now that your father is far too caught up in work to find the time to purchase gifts on his own. He trusts me to make those kinds of decisions.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHis grip on the scarf loosens. Marinette means nothing to the woman before him, and Adrien means little more. But Nathalie is just a facade, a bizarre cover for his own father who must, Adrien knows, be even less concerned. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t even purchase it, Nathalie,\u201d Adrien spits, \u201cMy friend made it and you passed it off as a gift from my father. I suppose you\u2019re lucky that it\u2019s flawless - imagine how upset p\u00e8re would have been to be associated with some handmade piece of garbage. Then again, he does associate with you, so he\u2019s used to it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlood drains from her face as Nathalie\u2019s surprise turns into outrage. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy, you-!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe turns on his heel and storms out of the house before she can continue, before she can decide to hold her tongue or hurl abuse. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdrien makes it three blocks before the venom of his words addles his brain. Without a doubt there will be hell to pay when he gets home - from both Nathalie and his father. Adrien had been raised better than that, raised to be polite, to listen, to bend to his father\u2019s indomitable force and never break. Whatever bond of pity he\u2019d had with Nathalie had surely snapped in his outburst. His father, ever distant, would discipline without discretion, without ever trying to understand. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChat had brought Adrien freedom, and Chat did not need Gabriel Agreste or Nathalie Sancouer. Neither did Adrien. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarinette Dupain-Cheng made him a scarf by hand for his birthday. Marinette had saved his life, again and again and again. Chat needed Marinette, and so did Adrien.\n\n\n\n\nChat has never been this nervous. Adrien has been nervous - plenty of times, some of the most vexing instances today, even - but until now the green glow of his transformation always seemed to whirl away his woes. Rather than saunter, Chat stomps; rather than a purr, he feels a growl stuck in the back of his throat. \nWhat irritates him most is the lack of certainty. Months ago, when they\u2019d set their patrol schedule, it had been with the intent of alternating nights. It had seemed reasonable at first that they would split the duty to keep either one of them from burning out, or to allow the other person a few free nights in their civilian life. But that had been months ago, and in the last two months both had fallen into the habit of joining the other on patrol even on their off day. It had started by accident, he thinks, the night after a particularly nasty akuma attack. The attack had been in the very arrondissement Chat was scheduled to begin in that night, and when Ladybug looked down on the street and realized where they were, she\u2019d offered him a shrug and a light \u2018May as well keep you company\u2019. \nTonight was technically Chat\u2019s night on. Ladybug had shown up every night for his patrol for weeks on end, but that didn't mean she would show now. \nHe picks up his pacing, on his way to wearing circles in the rooftop. The vintage bookstore below has been closed for over an hour, leaving any detection of him unlikely. That doesn't mean that he shouldn't be wary. The last thing Chat needed was an akuma or law enforcement, or worse, an unruly fan, to interfere with what he hoped would be happening tonight.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d he hisses under his breath. Chat pauses long enough to kick at a small chunk of concrete dislodged from the roof. \nJust his luck, that Ladybug would decide to be a no show on what was arguably the most important evening of their lives. Would she push him away without a word, trying to keep her identity her own at the cost of their partnership?\nNo. Chat shakes his head, trying to fling the thought away. Questions and uncertainties were Adrien. Chat had to be answers. \nFive more minutes. That\u2019s all he would give her. His patrols should have started nearly twenty minutes ago, and he wasn\u2019t about to let his feelings get in the way of his duty. Definitely not. \nFrom behind him something creaks. He spins on his heel towards the sound. His hand is already on the baton at his back when he processes Ladybug paused halfway through the door to the roof, staring at the door knob as though it had personally affronted her. Her nose wrinkles and her brows dip as she pouts at the thing. \n\u201cSorry I\u2019m late,\u201d she whispers, like they\u2019re not on a roof, like she didn\u2019t just come through the oldest, loudest door in all of Paris. \nIt\u2019s her. From toe to tip. From the way her shoulders scrunch up towards her ears in annoyance to the pop of her hips as she swings past the door, letting it shut behind her. Marinette.\n\u201cI got held up by a friend,\u201d Ladybug continues, walking towards him, \u201cI don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going for you, but mine are starting to get a smidge suspicious about all of my sudden disappearances. There are only so many times that \u2018last minute babysitting\u2019 and \u2018I can\u2019t, I\u2019ve got to wash my hair\u2019 are going to fly.\u201d\nThe tension in his chest unbuckles. Chat can breathe. \n\u201cI know you would never avoid me on purrpose,\u201d he says. Chat tries to shoot her his classic smirk, but a giddy smile slips out instead. \nShe returns his smile, and her shoulders go slack as whatever concern had held her stiff loosens. Her walk is pure confidence, like she\u2019s never been more comfortable in her life. Deep in his gut there\u2019s a hot and heavy twist. His pulse picks up in his ears. \n\u201cDoing alright?\u201d \nIt\u2019s with ease that she loops an arm around his elbow and rests her hand on his upper arm. The struggle is not to melt into her right then. Blue eyes peer up at him. The mask does a good job of obscuring much of the dark circles planted just below her eyes, but they two of them are close enough now for him to notice. He puts a hand on her arm to keep his hands from drifting up to cup her face. His thumbs twitch - they want to trace under each eye and sweep the weariness away. \n\u201cBetter now that you\u2019re here, My Lady,\u201d he says on a happy sigh. His smile doesn\u2019t falter, not once. \u201cLast night and this morning were\u2026 pretty pawful for the cat on the other side of the mask, but everything turned out okay. Wonderful, even.\u201d\nLadybug huffs at his pun, indignant, but holds smiles nonetheless. She tugs him over to the edge of the building so that they can look over the Jardins du Luxembourg. Chat watches as Ladybug\u2019s eyes track the gentle paths of the pedestrians below. The look seems part benevolent shepherd watching her flock, part queen surveying her holdings. Both suit her. He could watch her watch them for days. He knows he doesn't have much time left.\n\u201cGood,\u201d she says softly. Ladybug doesn't pry - never pries - though just this once Chat wishes she would. Oh, the things he has to share.\n\u201cReady to go?\u201d\n\u201cAlmost,\u201d Chat says. He looks down at her and finds her staring back up at him. \n\u201cI wanted to say thank you first,\u201d he continues.\n\u201cFor what?\u201d\nAdrien had spent hours rehearsing what he was going to say. Each word, every intonation, down to the breath and the bend of his brow. But what\u2019s easy in front of a bathroom mirror becomes impossible in the mirror of her eyes, when they\u2019re inches apart and all he wants to do is learn how her lips feel under his. The breath he takes to steady himself comes out shakily. All those poetic sentiments seem to vanish with it.\n\u201cThank you for my scarf, Marinette.\u201d\nIt\u2019s two-part reaction. For a split second she smiles, warm and shy, and then she freezes. Ladybug\u2019s smile jerks into a harsh line.\n\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d she whispers. \nHer hands are still on his arm, but her grip has tightened painfully. Chat\u2019s never seen her expression this wide open, this fearful. \nThere\u2019s no taking the words back. Forward is the only direction left to him.\n\u201cI wish you hadn't felt like you had to keep quiet about it. I wish we could have started being friends all that time ago. At school, I mean.\u201d\nHundreds of akuma, hundreds of life threatening moments, and Chat has never seen Ladybug as scared as she does now. Her lips part, she blanches. He knows there will be bruises under his suit from where she holds on. \n\u201cWhat did you call me?\u201d\n\u201cMarinette.\u201d\nHe could say her name forever. But she recoils, finally letting go of him. She staggers back and nearly trips on her own feet. Never does she break his stare, but she\u2019s no doubt maneuvering towards the door.\n\u201cMarinette, stay. Please.\u201d \nThe pleading in his voice is all Adrien, and he realizes he\u2019s doing this all wrong. Ladybug hesitates long enough for him to hiss, \u201cPlagg, come on out.\u201d\nHis transformation peels away with a flash. Scorched, it takes his eyes a moment to readjust. \nLadybug\u2019s lips form a delicate circle, an unspoken Oh. As if in slow-motion, her hands rise to cover her mouth. She\u2019s gone red, and gets redder as Adrien approaches. He\u2019s a few feet from her when she breathes something.\nThe warmth is unbelievable. Bathed in a soft pink light, Adrien marvels at how much power comes off of her fading transformation alone. He\u2019s blanketed in a gentle caress of feeling - it trails around his neck and winds up to ears, as if to say All is well, now. The magic dims. \nMarinette peeks out from over her fingertips. Her hands don\u2019t drop, trying to hide what her mask no longer can: the redness of her cheeks, the smattering freckles on her nose. \n\u201cAdrien\u2026?\u201d she says in a muffled voice.\n\u201cC\u2019est moi.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re Chat.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not a question.\n\u201cYup.\u201d \nAdrien spreads his arms and shrugs a little, opening himself to her gaze. Instead, Marinette squeezes her eyes shut and groans.\n\u201cI-I\u2019ve been such an idiot,\u201d she says, \u201cYou must be so disappointed. We, ah, we don\u2019t have to-\u201d\nHe closes the final few feet between them and places his hands over hers. She doesn\u2019t resist when he pulls her hands away from her face, but the discomfort, the worry, is evident. Keep yourself together, Adrien repeats to himself, Don\u2019t freak her out. It\u2019s a hard impulse to control. To not intertwine his fingers with hers and tug her to him seems an impossible feat. \n\u201cI\u2019m not disappointed,\u201d he says softly, \u201cYou could have been Chloe.\u201d\nWhat he thought would be a comfort only seems to upset Marinette more - her lips purse, and he can feel her shaking. \n\u201cI also could have been anyone other than boring old Marinette.\u201d\nHer eyes drift down to their hands and she shakes her head. \n\u201cAll of the boys in all of Paris, and you had to be Chat,\u201d she says. \nThe edge in her voice cuts with shocking force, and his heart gives a painful thud. Just last night she\u2019d said- she couldn\u2019t really mean-\n\u201cI\u2026 I thought you liked me?\u201d His words sound frailer than he\u2019d like. \nThe \u201cI do!\u201d that follows comes out more as an anguished moan than actual words. Marinette draws her hands back like she wants to cover her face again, but only succeeds in yanking him forward. Their knees bump and their bodies sway to regain balance.\n\u201cI do,\u201d she says again, quieter, \u201cI really, really do. A minute. I need a minute, I think.\u201d \nHe lets her go and shoves his hands in his pockets to keep himself from pulling her back. Marinette ducks past him and stiffly walks over to the roof\u2019s ledge. Carefully she sits and crosses her legs, back to him. There\u2019s a flutter of movement at her shoulder - something small and bright red - and Marinette cocks an ear towards it. Her kwami, he realizes, and the desire to simply know everything about her surges up from his chest. \nPlagg, hovering at the back of his collar, floats past his ear and beelines for Marinette. Adrien is so stunned he almost doesn\u2019t catch him, but at the last moment he plucks the tiny kwami out of the air. \n\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d Adrien mutters. Plagg wriggles and sticks his tongue out at Adrien before going limp. He floats, belly up, and glares at his captor.\n\u201cTo catch up with Tikki, duh. What gives?\u201d\n\u201cTikki?\u201d\nTogether, they glance over at the girl. It\u2019s impossible to hear what she\u2019s saying, but it\u2019s clear she\u2019s deep in conversation with her small companion. Marinette is gesticulating wildly, occasionally grabbing her head and tugging at her hair. He can just make out Tikki\u2019s tiny arm patting the girl on the back. \n\u201cYeah, she\u2019s a bit of a goody two-shoes,\u201d Plagg says, rolling his eyes, \u201cbut she\u2019s okay company. It\u2019s been forever since us kwamis have had a good get-together, with your Ladybug all up in arms about her identity.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get your chance,\u201d Adrien says, still keeping his voice low, \u201cBut I think... maybe... we should just leave Marinette be for right now.\u201d\nPlagg snorts and tugs a little at his tail, but Adrien holds firm. \u201cYou humans and your crushes. At the rate you two go, I'll be 6000 and you\u2019ll still be all \u2018Oh, ah, euh!\u2019. It took you two long enough to figure each other out as it was.\u201d\nAdrien narrows his eyes.\n\u201cWell I was about to let you go, Plagg, but now I think you have some explaining to do. Did you know Marinette was Ladybug? This whole time?\u201d\nThe kwami\u2019s gaze slides to the side and he crosses his arms. \u201cJust because you were too dumb to see all of the obvious signs\u2026\u201d\n\u201cPlagg\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI may or may not have been able to sense Tikki every time you two were close. For a while it was hard to tell which one of your classmates it was, but after that weirdo art kid got possessed by the akuma and you guys were stuck on that boat together, it was pretty obvious.\u201d\nHis black nose goes up in the air, an attempt at defiance, but Adrien can see Plagg\u2019s ears flatten. \n\u201cAnd I guarantee Tikki\u2019s known since then, too,\u201d Plagg finishes with a sniff.\n\u201cWhy didn't you tell me!\u201d Adrien yelps, throwing his hands up in the air.\nJudging by the way Marinette\u2019s head whips around, she must have heard. Her eyes are still wide, though now rimmed in red. Adrien and Plagg shrink back simultaneously. \n\u201cSorry- just- Plagg\u2026?\u201d Adrien says. He lets go of Plagg\u2019s tail, and the kwami shoots her a wave and a grin.\nShe rubs her eyes and returns a watery smile. Tikki pops up over her shoulder and spots Plagg. Her two antenna stick straight up at the sight, and she tucks back besides Marinette\u2019s ear to whisper something. After a moment, Marinette nods.\nTikki zooms over, flying straight for Adrien\u2019s face. He feels the rush of air as she speeds past his ear and collides with Plagg. The two tumble away in a buzz of laughter and groans. When the two finally stop spinning, Tikki flutter-drags them both back around to Adrien\u2019s front. \n\u201cHi, I\u2019m Tikki!\u201d she chirps. Tikki sounds like trilling flutes and honey, and it\u2019s so warm, it makes so much sense. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to officially meet you, Adrien.\u201d\nHe shakes the tiny paw she offers, utterly charmed. And it\u2019s clear he\u2019s not the only one: Plagg\u2019s taken to nuzzling up under her chin, only stopping to scowl and look away when he notices Adrien noticing.\n\u201cI thought it would be better for you and Marinette to find each other on your own, but\u2026\u201d Tikki glances at her charge, who has gone back to staring out at the gardens below, \u201cMaybe I should have said something.\u201d\nAdrien bites his bottom lip, a weight in his stomach. He wishes he\u2019d known forever ago, wishes he\u2019d seen it as easily as Tikki and Plagg. Wishes one of them had spilled. But he can\u2019t hold it against Tikki, knowing how hard Marinette had fought to keep her identity safe. As unlikely it seems of Plagg, he must have had some respect for Ladybug\u2019s wishes as well.\n\u201cIs she mad?\u201d\nShe shakes her head. \u201cConfused, mostly. A little scared.\u201d\n\u201cScared? Of what? Me?\u201d\nThis time, Tikki nods a sad affirmative and sighs. \u201cMarinette doesn\u2019t always see how wonderful she really is. She thinks there\u2019s no way you could possibly love her.\u201d She pauses and drifts a little closer, smile returning to her face. \u201cBut I know that\u2019s not true.\u201d\nThe blush that burns his cheeks is impossible to quench, and she laughs delightedly at the sight of it. As red as his face, Tikki swoops up to his cheek and places a light kiss there. Adrien stammers out something that ultimately fails to be words. \n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Adrien. Marinette is the bravest person I know. It won\u2019t be long at all until she\u2019s ready to face her fears.\u201d\n\u201cCh- Adrien?\u201d\nThey freeze at Marinette\u2019s voice. Her back still faces them, but she\u2019s sat up straighter and unfolded her legs. Adrien can tell she\u2019s tipped her head back and is listening, waiting.\n\u201cSee?\u201d Tikki whispers. She pats him in the same place she left her kiss and then zips away, Plagg following behind. \nA deep breath is necessary before he crosses the roof to her. Adrien exhales slowly, bracing himself and trying to swallow the nerves clawing up into his throat. He goes. \nMarinette\u2019s legs kick lightly at the air as they dangle over the building\u2019s ledge. At first glance the motion comes across as carefree, but Adrien can see how she squares her shoulders. On the precipice of something this big, Marinette is steeling herself for battle. \n\u201cMarinette\u2026\u201d\nShe turns to look up at him. Her lips purse and one brow pops up, curious. Just like that, he\u2019s taken captive.\n\u201cWhen did you figure it out?\u201d she asks, unwavering. \n\u201cLast night. Just last night, when you starting talking about, ah, you know, about\u2026\u201d\nAdrien can\u2019t bring himself to say it. \n\u201cAbout you,\u201d Marinette supplies, \u201cYou you. Like, current you.\u201d\n\u201cYeah. You talked about the scarf, and sitting behind me, and it all just clicked.\u201d\nShe nods along with his words, face unreadable. Marinette doesn\u2019t pick up when his sentence trails off, leaving his heartbeats to fill the silence. Were it not for the suffocating tension, he\u2019d be content in the lull to simply take her in. Even disguising her emotions Marinette proves lovely, especially framed as she is by the darkening sky. \n\u201cWhy did you leave when you figured out who I was?\u201d\nAdrien flinches - it\u2019s clear she tries to hide the bitterness in her words, but it still scrapes over him. There was no way she could have determined why he freaked out and fled. The memory of her from this morning, unenthusiastic and tired, makes him wish the roof below his feet would collapse, swallow him. \n\u201cYou making my scarf meant that it hadn\u2019t been a gift from my father. He hadn\u2019t known about it, or cared. After thinking for all of that time that he might have been different, it was\u2026 it was a shock. My mind went blank. I just didn\u2019t think.\u201d\nSadness worms its way onto her features, and the fact that she could still be upset for him, could care so much as to let her own feelings go unknown for his sake astounds him. Disbelief and wonder pound at his chest in equal measure. Marinette\u2019s eyes slip closed for a moment and she takes a long, heavy breath. Her head rises an inch and when she opens her eyes again, it\u2019s with a look somewhere between cautious and defiant.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t because I\u2019m\u2026 me?\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t because you\u2019re you,\u201d Adrien says firmly, \u201cThe only disappointment from last night was my father. Never you.\u201d\nThe sound she makes is so slight that he almost doesn\u2019t catch it. Another \u2018oh\u2019, soft and happy, curls around her lips as they toy with the idea of a smile. He catches her glancing up at him and decides that he never wants to look away again. \n\u201cSo this is it, huh?\u201d she asks, \u201cUs? Ladybug and Chat Noir, insufferable idiots, Paris\u2019 heroes brought down by their own awkward timing.\u201d\nThe setting sun weaves golden streaks into her hair and drapes over her shoulders, radiant. Adrien would curse the lost year, the months of inattention where Marinette sat on his periphery, were in not for the desire to stay on this roof and make up for all of that lost time in one sitting. The void of her only made greater the space she could fill - he would take in the sight until all of him was overrunning with her.\n\u201cA-at least now I can put together most of a sentence,\u201d she says, still stumbling on her words when she registers how intently he\u2019s staring, \u201cAdrien seemed so impossible to talk to, but Chat? Easy peasy. When I could get a word in edgewise, of course.\u201d\nAnd suddenly, she\u2019s teasing him. No masks, no secrets. Marinette teasing him. Adrien. Wholly awed by the change, he complies when she pats the space on the ledge next to her. \n\u201cLet\u2019s play a game,\u201d Marinette says. Her thigh rests against his; neither shift away.\n\u201cIt\u2019s called two truths and a lie. Heard of it before?\u201d\nIt takes him a moment to respond, frozen as he is by the cold trickle of fear. She shatters the sheen of ice when she nudges him in the ribs with an elbow.\n\u201cDon't worry, I'll start.\u201d\nA flicker of concern passes over her face now. She breaks the hold she\u2019d had on his gaze and stares down past her knees, down to the city. Marinette takes a deep breath.\n\u201cI like Adrien Agreste. I like Chat Noir. I've definitely never thought about kissing either of them.\u201d\nAdrien doesn\u2019t need to breathe. Not now, not ever, not when Marinette\u2019s words knock the air right out of him and replace his insides with absolute fire. He knows he should ask but he doesn\u2019t - he grabs her hand and presses it to his lips. They\u2019ve gone through this motion a million times, but somehow the intensity becomes exponential now that they\u2019ve dropped their masks. Her skin feels soft. Her eyes are very, very blue, and she does not roll them to the heavens when he lets go. \n\u201cThe last one,\u201d he says, \u201cis the lie, I think. I hope.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Marinette says slowly, feeling out the weight of each word as it comes, \u201cYou are good at this game, Adrien.\u201d\nIf it were within the realm of scientific reality, he might have started glowing then and there. Every nerve in his body lights up, thrumming with the way Marinette intones his name: sweetness and a shiver, like she\u2019s been waiting to say it, like she can\u2019t believe it. What follows is nothing new, not to either of them, but it seems truer than it ever has before. \n\u201cI am in love with the most incredible girl,\u201d Adrien says, \u201cI have never met someone more beautiful. I\u2019ve also never thought about kissing her.\u201d\nAnd to think, he\u2019d been getting used to hearing her voice without her tripped and stammered syllables. Marinette makes a series of embarrassed noises, each rising in pitch and becoming less and less coherent. \n\u201cBut, I\u2019m-\u201d she gestures to herself, wrinkling her nose. I'm Marinette, she wants to say, as if that would dampen the surge of fire just under his skin. Adrien can\u2019t - won\u2019t - help it, he leans in until it is not just their thighs that touch, but the entire line of their bodies, hip to shoulder. He wants the air left between them to vacate. He wishes he could lean in a few inches closer, but the last thing he wants to do is crowd or push her away. Instead, he settles for words.\n\u201cYou\u2019re what? The only person on Earth who knows my secret? The girl who has saved my life more times than I can count? The creator of the best gift I've ever gotten-\u201d\n\u201cCh- Adrien,\u201d she groans, hiding her face in her hands once more. Pink still stands out on her skin. He'd never get tired of that color. \n\u201cToo kindhearted for your own good? The best friend and partner I've ever had?.\u201d \nThe words pass his lips without thought because he\u2019s so flooded with what\u2019s true. Adrien had known Ladybug since the first day he sat down in front of her and returned her choked, timid hello. He\u2019d known Marinette since the first day she\u2019d swung down from the Paris skyline, yo-yo spinning at her side. To separate the two struck him as impossible, needless. \n\u201cStop it!\u201d she whines, sounding mortified, but her protest is weak. Adrien catches a sliver of a grin from between her fingers. \n\u201cWhy should I?\u201d \nMarinette\u2019s response is low and garbled. Despite his best efforts, Adrien can\u2019t make it out, but he gets the feeling it\u2019s more than a little embarrassed.\n\u201cWhat was that, Marinette?\u201d he asks, trying and failing to control his teasing tone. He can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s Chat or Adrien anymore, and for the first time ever, he doesn\u2019t have to care because she likes all of him. \nHer arms go limp and her face is revealed to be a spectacular palette of pinks and reds and blue. Marinette puts on her best exasperated face and won\u2019t meet his eyes, but she can\u2019t control her quiver as she says, \u201cYou should stop because I would like to kiss you, Chat. You, I mean. Adrien. Kiss you. And you\u2019re talking too much for me to do that.\u201d\nYou\u2019re the one who\u2019s babbling, Adrien wants to say, but he\u2019d rather not give her a reason to go back on her sentiment (and he knows Ladybug would, if only to tease him). So he nods and produces a jumble of sounds that might mean something like \u2018I would like that,\u2019 and then Marinette is turning her body toward him and stretching up just a little, staring at him with want and worry and ghosting her lips lightly across his. \nThe touch sends lightning down his spine - Adrien grabs her by the hips to ground himself. Wordless, they shift until they\u2019re no longer half-dangling on the side of the roof. There\u2019s an awkward shuffle as knees and elbows and feet are arranged to something resembling comfortable on the hard concrete. Satisfied, Marinette leans in to Adrien\u2019s pull and kisses him again. She wraps her arms around his neck and their knees bump together and Adrien forgets what being cold ever felt like. \nFor the first few forevers they simply press their lips together. It would be ungainly if it weren\u2019t so perfect - neither of them knows quite what to do with their hands or their mouths - but presentation is ignored for the sake of sensation. Eventually he settles for running his hands up and down her sides, while she dedicates herself to gently dragging her fingers through his hair. \nThe nighttime sky is lit with stars and the Eiffel Tower glimmers, hazy in the distance, by the time Adrien deepens their kiss. It\u2019s a hesitant question that he starts with a flick of his tongue and ends by letting his teeth graze gently across her bottom lip. Her answer is punctuated by a heady gasp and a sudden pull at his hair. Marinette\u2019s lips part. \nWhere they go from there, Adrien can\u2019t keep track of, but he knows it\u2019s marked by too many painful collisions with their teeth, a moan he isn\u2019t able to swallow in time, and a shocked giggle from Marinette the first time their tongues slide together. Eventually they find a rhythm. From that point on, Adrien is certain he\u2019s never known anything except for the feel of Marinette on his skin.\nOnly once does Marinette pull away. The two of them are lit in the gleam of streetlights and passing cars, but he can see how undone she looks even in the dark. \n\u201cWe should probably stop. Patrols,\u201d she says, chest heaving as she sucks in forgotten air. \n\u201cParis can survive one night without us,\u201d Adrien says. He dips back in to leave a quick kiss on her lips. Marinette tries to follow his lips as he leans away, showing her hand.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lie,\u201d Marinette says, laughing, but she lets him kiss her again and again anyway."
