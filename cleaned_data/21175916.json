    "text": "\u00a0\n\nSee, here\u2019s the thing. Zuko might be a cantankerous, dangerous pain in the ass, but he\u2019s a useful pain in the ass. He can help out with Aang\u2019s little not-knowing-how-to-firebend problem, he can hunt, he can cook, he can fight...and he doesn\u2019t really ask for much in return. He\u2019s like the best polar bear dog in the world, if polar bear dogs came shaped like teenage boys and equipped with fire.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSokka doesn\u2019t really like him, and he doesn\u2019t really trust him, but he\u2019s a guy who can recognize somebody useful. A good chief never throws away a serviceable tool.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHa.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTool.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe point is that Sokka doesn\u2019t have to like the guy, but he accepts him as he comes as best he can because Sozin\u2019s Comet is \n\nright around the corner\n\n. He\u2019s got to be reasonable about this if he wants to even consider a future if they can win. Toph agrees with him on that front, luckily, but Katara\u2019s so focused on Aang that she can\u2019t even consider it. Sokka\u2019s not an idiot, though. She\u2019ll either change her kind or she won\u2019t, but she knows that under no circumstances is she allowed to murder the prince of the Fire Nation.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s a terrible plan. Sokka\u2019s had his share of terrible plans but that one might actually be The Worst Plan.\n\n\u00a0\n\nZuko\u2019s still kind of a dickhead, though.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThanks for breakfast, ricebender,\u201d he says that morning when Zuko scoops him a bowl of congee out of the cooking pot, \u201cYou didn\u2019t poison it, did you?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Zuko says sweetly and for just a second sounds \n\nso much like Katara\n\n that Sokka realizes immediately that he fucked up, \u201cLet me help you with that.\u201d He reaches out and touches the bowl that Sokka\u2019s holding on the bottom with a fingertip and it immediately goes so hot that Sokka screeches and nearly drops it.\n\n\u00a0\n\nZuko snickers under his breath like the asshole he is.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWanted to make sure it was hot enough.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nToph cackles from across the room, and Sokka glares, sets his bowl down, and blows on his fingers.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou wanna go?\u201d he threatens. Zuko lifts his jaw imperiously and stares down at him. There\u2019s a little furrow between his eyebrows that means he\u2019s holding himself back from throttling something; Sokka sees that furrow a lot.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWith you? Absolutely not.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe acts like a throwdown with Sokka\u2019s not even worth his time, and it makes Sokka want to knock him upside the head with Boomerang. But no. If Katara\u2019s not allowed to murder him, Sokka isn\u2019t either.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe thinks it\u2019s a bit of a shame sometimes.\n\n\u00a0\n\nZuko turns away from him, and Sokka lets it drop but doesn\u2019t forget.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe waits until Aang gets distracted by a dragon-butterfly, and leaves Zuko alone in their training ring. Then he approaches, meteorite sword in hand.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d he calls, and Zuko turns to look at him. \u201cPut up or shut up. Go get your steel unless you\u2019re pigchicken!\u201d Golden eyes sharpen, and Zuko\u2019s already grouchy face gets even grouchier.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cFighting you wouldn\u2019t be worth the time it takes to get them,\u201d he retorts.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSokka expected this, wheels around, and takes off running. A lifetime of bothering Katara has prepared him for just this moment.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cGuess they\u2019re mine, then!\u201d He hollers and makes off in the direction of Zuko\u2019s room. For a second, he thinks it hasn\u2019t worked and then hard, pounding footsteps sound behind him. Then, Zuko passes him and bolts down the hall for his blades. Having appropriately goaded a dual-wielding firebender, Sokka stops running and moseys his way back to the training ring.\n\n\u00a0\n\nZuko\u2019s got pride and lots of it. He won\u2019t let this shit slide, and Sokka\u2019s depending on it. He\u2019s not surprised when Zuko stomps back from whence he came, face drawn tight and eyes furious, holding his dao like he was born with them. Not fucking fair that can do that \n\nand\n\n bend. Not even fucking fair.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou ready to go now, Princess?\u201d Sokka mocks him and doesn\u2019t even give Zuko a chance to reply before he\u2019s flying at him with a shout. Blades come together with a clang, and it doesn\u2019t take long for Sokka to realize that he may have miscalculated.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s seen Zuko firebend, of course, and knows that he\u2019s fast and strong and aggressive, knows that he wouldn\u2019t stand a chance if this was a bending match even if he \n\ncould \n\ncontrol one of the elements. What he didn\u2019t take into consideration was the fact that Zuko might actually be faster and stronger with steel than he is with flame, and even though Sokka starts out with the element of surprise, he doesn\u2019t get to keep it for long before Zuko\u2019s backing him up, attacking and defending seamlessly by turn.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSokka whips around and swings, but Zuko slips behind him and pulls a move he \n\nknows\n\n he\u2019s seen Aang do more than once. Pressing a hand to the space between Sokka\u2019s shoulders and keeping behind him, doing little more than being a wily, annoying piece of shit while poking him in the thigh with the tip of his sword, not hard enough to draw blood, but definitely hard enough to piss Sokka right off.\n\n\u00a0\n\nLet it not be said that a firebender can\u2019t learn some new tricks. Sokka just didn\u2019t know how many he had.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cQuit fighting like an airbender,\u201d Sokka snarls, still unable to turn around. Zuko takes pity on him seconds later and lets turn to face him, only to duck his next swing and get right up in Sokka\u2019s face.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIf it ain\u2019t broke,\u201d he huffs, and then somehow gets Sokka\u2019s sword between both of his, twists, and wrenches it out of his hands to send it flying across the ring. Sokka lurches forward but Zuko immediately backs off, lowering his blades like he thinks they\u2019re done.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOh, no way.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd then Sokka throws himself at him and punches Zuko right in the face, grabs him by the collar, and throws him to the ground.\n\n\u00a0\n\nZuko yelps, but he\u2019s startled, and it slows him enough that Sokka can avoid his first wild, flailing hit. Not the second one, though, when Zuko whips out his leg to knock Sokka\u2019s feet out from under him and then clocks him in the jaw.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey scuffle on the ground for a good minute until Sokka manages to pin Zuko enough to scramble up and sit on him, pressing down on his belly and digging his own knees into the dirt, pushing Zuko\u2019s shoulders down with his palms.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBoth of them are heaving, trying to catch their breath, and Sokka can\u2019t help but grin down at him.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cLesson one of the Southern Water Tribe,\u201d he tells him smugly, \u201cIt ain\u2019t over til it\u2019s over.\u201d Bragging\u2019s not cute, but he hardly ever gets to do it.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe expects to get immediately thrown off, but it never comes.\n\n\u00a0\n\nZuko\u2019s very, very still on the ground, and his eyes are so wide that even the one with the scar is showing white all around. Sokka can feel him practically vibrating under his hands and experimentally, just to see what\u2019ll happen, puts a hair more pressure on him. Zuko sinks down, silent and strangely pliant, as if all the fight\u2019s gone out of him.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey, man,\u201d Sokka says, \u201cYou good?\u201d He wanted to beat Zuko up a little, but he didn\u2019t wanna give the guy brain damage. Sokka doesn\u2019t know him super well, but he knows he\u2019s not a quitter, and he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s ever seen him so motionless. \u201cYo, Jerkbender!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe feels like maybe he should check for a pulse, so he moves his hands from where they curl quietly over the curve of Zuko\u2019s shoulders to the exposed line of pale throat exposed by his red tunic. They close to touch flesh and at the contact, Zuko about jumps out of his skin.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAll the color that the exertion of their match brought to his face drains down into his collar to leave him ghost white. Zuko shoves \n\nhard\n\n, throwing Sokka off of him like it takes absolutely nothing and leaping to his feet with a loud clatter.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c\n\nDon\u2019t touch me\n\n,\u201d Zuko snarls like some furious, wild thing, but Sokka\u2019s distracted by the fact that his hands, always so steady even when moving, are shaking violently. \u201c\n\nDo not put your hands on me.\n\n\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey, dude, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Sokka tries to apologize because he doesn\u2019t understand what the hell just happened. Zuko won\u2019t look at him or even come closer, and instead starts backing away, step by unsteady step, until he takes a sharp inhale, turns around\u2026\n\n\u00a0\n\n...and flees.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSokka\u2019s left, then, standing bruised and tired in the middle of the ring, alone.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nZuko doesn\u2019t come back that evening.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe doesn\u2019t come back for lunch. He doesn\u2019t come back to work with Aang that afternoon. He doesn\u2019t even come back for dinner. Sokka\u2019s the last person to see him, and he fields off the inevitable questions with as much diplomacy as he can without giving away details that aren\u2019t anybody\u2019s business. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s going to go out of his way to tell everybody he got his ass handed to him and then proceeded to lose the Avatar\u2019s firebending teacher.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe feels like that particular direction of questioning wouldn\u2019t go well.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo, what?\u201d Toph demands, \u201cY\u2019all just fought and then he \n\nleft\n\n? You\u2019re not leaving \n\nanything\n\n out?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nCurse that blind monster\u2019s built in lie detector.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNope,\u201d Sokka squeaks, nonetheless, \u201cHe just left.\u201d Not a complete lie, but definitely not the truth.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSomething happened; he\u2019s just not sure what it is.\n\n\u00a0\n\nToph glares at him but doesn\u2019t keep interrogating him. For whatever reason, she actually really likes Zuko, and she knows he\u2019s being shady. But whatever his heartbeat tells her, she lets it drop.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be back soon,\u201d Aang says optimistically because Aang\u2019s world is a bright and shiny place that makes sense, apparently.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSokka wishes he had that much hope.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nZuko does come back.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe waits until he thinks that everyone\u2019s got to be asleep before he slinks back into the temple. If Sokka wasn\u2019t watching for him, he\u2019d never have known because while he\u2019s not hiding, his steps are soft and above all, \n\nsilent\n\n. It doesn\u2019t take Zuko long to realize that Sokka\u2019s awake and sitting up and watching him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe looks \n\nterrible.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nZuko\u2019s hair has that dried up sweaty look of someone who worked themselves out past the point of comfort for too long, his eyes are red-rimmed, and his hands are still trembling a little bit. Not as badly as before, but he\u2019s yet to build back his composure completely.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSokka doesn\u2019t know what exactly happened, but he knows that it was \n\nbad\n\n, and in the name of not running the other boy off again, makes a point of making himself look non-threatening. When Zuko doesn\u2019t come any closer, Sokka waves to him.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some food saved if you want it,\u201d he says softly.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo thanks, I\u2019m good,\u201d Zuko says stiffly with absolutely no feeling in his voice and takes a step in the direction of his room, the heels of his feet toeing the wall.\n\n\u00a0\n\nZuko is, like, the opposite of good.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cPlease come sit for a bit, maybe eat something,\u201d Sokka says. He\u2019s not a spiritual kind of guy, but he\u2019s got pretty decent people skills. He has a feeling that if he doesn\u2019t do something about this with Zuko, they might never see him again. \u201cWe were worried about you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nZuko doesn\u2019t look like he believes it but it\u2019s enough to make him take a step forward, out of the shadows and towards what\u2019s left of the campfire, eventually settling down across from Sokka and keeping the fire between them. Sokka\u2019s not sure he means to do it, but the gesture\u2019s meaning, subconscious or not, is obvious.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThis is my weapon and I am prepared to use it.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nSokka lets Zuko keep his space and goes to scoop him a bowl of stew that Katara\u2019s had chilling in a box of ice. It won\u2019t keep for too long but there\u2019s more than enough for breakfast.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cold,\u201d he says when he returns, making a point of sitting next to him and not across from him,\u00a0 \u201cbut you can take care of that.\u201d He hands Zuko the bowl and is relieved when the banished prince breathes, long and purposeful, and steam starts wafting from the now-hot food. \u201cI think Katara used some of your red stuff in it.\u201d Zuko\u2019s red stuff is a jar of some Fire Nation spice that makes everything just a little bit fiery, a paste of red chilis and tons of wild grass-garlic. Zuko puts it in \n\neverything\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\nZuko takes an appreciative whiff and takes a bite, and Sokka takes advantage of his mouth being full to talk.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cListen, man, I\u2019m really sorry for earlier. I just wanted to check your pulse, I wasn\u2019t trying to, like, strangle you. But I probably still should have warned you first, and I didn\u2019t, and I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nBecause at the core of it, Sokka doesn\u2019t hate Zuko. Even when they were fighting earlier, he didn\u2019t even really want to hurt him. It\u2019s just that sometimes it\u2019s easier to talk with actions than with words. And Zuko is really, really bad at using his words.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s...it\u2019s okay,\u201d Zuko says, finally, and Sokka shakes his head.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s not okay, though. There\u2019s a difference between forgiveness and something being okay, and Sokka knows the difference. He has a sinking feeling that Zuko maybe doesn\u2019t.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t okay. It\u2019s okay for it to not be okay. I just\u2026I\u2019d rather you accept my apology if you can, and if not, that\u2019s fine too. But don\u2019t lie to me and say what I did to you was okay because it wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s a solid five minutes of silence, and Zuko eats without meeting his eyes, and Sokka feels like he\u2019s going to scream if this is how it ends.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026\u201d finally some words come out of Zuko\u2019s mouth, very quiet and very deliberate. Sokka stops twisting his hands. \u201cSometimes somebody will do something and my brain shuts off. I \n\nknow\n\n you didn\u2019t mean to, you know, but I don\u2019t think\u2026I don\u2019t think my brain knew that.\u201d Sokka\u2019s got no clue what he means by that, but then he thinks back and remembers what Zuko looked like before, like a tiger-seal pushed up against a wall, and then he thinks he does. \u201cIt\u2019s...bad, sometimes.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBad \n\nseems like an understatement.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat makes it happen most?\u201d \n\nSo that I can never do it again\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\nZuko flinches.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSudden movements, sometimes. Sometimes not. Sometimes, uh, sometimes Uncle would try and hug me and it would be bad. One time he had to pull me out of the rafters when I still had my ship. Dao, uh, my ship\u2019s cook touched my shoulder once when I didn\u2019t see him. I nearly knocked him out, and Uncle had to spend the rest of the night with me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThat\u2019s...that\u2019s really bad\n\n, Sokka thinks, and maybe he shouldn\u2019t have been surprised. Most of Zuko\u2019s life seems like a waking nightmare from what he knows about it, but what he describes sounds more happens when you\u2019re so used to being hurt that you expect it every time somebody touches you.\n\n\u00a0\n\nZuko\u2019s not some craggy old dude who\u2019s been on the front lines for the last thirty years. He\u2019s a \n\nkid\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just spend your whole life like that! You\u2019ll either freak out and kill somebody or\u2026\u201d Something worse. \u201cHow are you gonna find a nice Fire Nation girl to marry you if she can\u2019t even hold your hand?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWeirdly, Zuko just shrugs.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent the last three years knowing I probably wouldn\u2019t survive this. That hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nSokka can\u2019t stand for that and takes the bowl right out of his hands to set it on the floor and takes Zuko\u2019s hands in both of his, squeezing tightly. He\u2019s so \n\nwarm\n\n.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDude, that\u2019s like the most awful shit I\u2019ve ever heard come out of your mouth,\u201d he exclaims, \u201cDon't ever, ever say that around Aang.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThough Zuko looks like he\u2019s never said it around anybody, because his eyes are wide and shocked and almost horrified. His hands are tight in Sokka\u2019s, coiled and tense, and he gives them another squeeze, a softer one this time.\n\n\u00a0\n\nZuko doesn\u2019t pull away.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIs this bad?\u201d Sokka asks and slowly, so slowly, the firebender shakes his head.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he answers finally, \u201cThat\u2019s...that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s fine.\u201d It\u2019s like he\u2019s trying to convince himself more than anyone else but honestly, he does seem to calm and settle under the touch.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSokka gives his hands another firm squeeze and marvels at what his life has become.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cListen, man, I know you\u2019re big and tough and shit, but you can\u2019t live thinking everybody\u2019s gonna hurt you\u2014\u201c\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c\n\nEveryone has hurt me\n\n.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nSokka freezes, and it\u2019s like Zuko reanimates, shaking his hands away from him and pulling them back towards himself.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThis isn't a poor me pity party,\u201d Zuko continues as if that was a totally fucking normal thing to say, \u201cBut it\u2019s the truth and it\u2019s the way that it is. I accepted that before I was even banished. Some things aren\u2019t gonna change, even if I want them too. I fucked over the only person that never--nevermind. Nevermind.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s just fucking heartbreaking.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSokka grabs his hands back and ignores Zuko\u2019s sharp inhale of breath, scoots closer until they\u2019re hip to hip, side pressed up against side.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay, but listen,\u201d he emphasizes each word with a firm squeeze of fingers, \u201cHere\u2019s the thing. And I know you\u2019re not gonna believe it, but I\u2019m gonna say it anyway. Not everybody wants to hurt you. I don\u2019t. Not maliciously. Not outside of a training match, and not really even then. I want to win, but like, even then the goal is not to hurt you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nSokka switches tactics because the current one\u2019s not working, shuffles around to sit cross-legged in front of Zuko and look him very seriously in the eyes.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou know, we have a thing in the South Pole. They say that when a baby\u2019s born, you can give it food and shelter and safety and it\u2019ll still die if you don\u2019t touch it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAre you \n\nseriously \n\nimplying that I wasn\u2019t cuddled enough as a baby?\u201d Zuko asks, completely deadpan.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNah, man, nah. You\u2019re missing the point. I\u2019m just saying that maybe that kind of stuff doesn\u2019t really go away, you know? Look how much Aang and Katara touch people. Hell, even I do! Even \n\nToph\n\n likes to be touched. What I think is that somewhere along the line, somebody started fucking you up, and it\u2019s \n\nstill \n\nmessing you up because the need doesn\u2019t go away even if you want it to. And, okay, maybe some people don\u2019t like being touched and that\u2019s cool, but I...I think that you do.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe words land like a blow, and Zuko flinches even though he hasn\u2019t been struck. Sokka softens it by rubbing his thumbs over the ridges of Zuko\u2019s knuckles like he\u2019s a frightened ostrich-horse. His palms and fingers are calloused and scarred from years of bending and training and whatever else a prince needs to do, but the tops are soft and smooth.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe never have to talk about it again if you don\u2019t want to, but be honest. Does it feel good?\u201d Sokka slackens his grip enough that if Zuko moves even a bit, his hands will be freed and drop. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna \n\nhurt\n\n you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nZuko sags forward like a puppet with its strings cut and he tightens his grip on Sokka\u2019s hands like it\u2019s all that\u2019s keeping him upright. He slips downward until his forehead rests so softly on Sokka\u2019s sternum that if he\u2019d had his eyes closed, he wouldn\u2019t have felt it at all. The guy looks \n\nexhausted\n\n, like he could easily sleep for a week and then go back to bed. The tension drains out of his body, and his fingers hold solidly onto Sokka\u2019s hands, no longer trembling.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt feels good,\u201d he admits like it hurts. Maybe it does. \u201cPlease don\u2019t move.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSokka doesn\u2019t move. He\u2019s not sure how long he sits there like a statue to let Zuko pull himself together, but eventually the other boy sits up and lets him go on his own.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe won\u2019t look at him at all, but the way he gets up and walks back to his room is looser and more easy than Sokka\u2019s ever seen him.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nThings are...weirdly normal after that.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSokka isn\u2019t sure what he expected to change, but honestly, it\u2019s like their conversation the past night never happened. And that\u2019s fine, Sokka doesn\u2019t need to be his best friend, he just needs the guy to exist functionally so that Aang might actually live to see thirteen. While it doesn\u2019t seem to have affected Zuko all that much, Sokka\u2019s annoyed to find that he\u2019s more attuned to him now.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNot just whether he looks like he\u2019s going to double cross them, but more like his general state of being. Once he starts looking it\u2019s actually really easy to see what starts to ruffle him up; they\u2019re all used to hearing him shout and holler and screech, but it seems that when Zuko gets really, truly upset, he goes quiet.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd Zuko is so quiet after they get back from their \n\nhorrible fucking field trip \n\nto Boiling Rock.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s jumpy, evasive, and silent when they return with Suki, Chit-Sang, and Dad in tow, and any attempt to train with him, talk to him, or touch him is met with extreme prejudice and more than a few hours of Zuko hiding himself in every corner he can find like a feral pygmy-puma. This is a problem now because Sokka is \n\ninvested\n\n and also a natural connoisseur of poking things that should not be poked, including but not limited to, banished, firebending princes.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe won\u2019t come within six feet of Dad, and if he\u2019s got the option he\u2019ll choose the other side of the room, even if it\u2019s the side that opens out into where the chilliest breezes blow. Maybe it\u2019s because he knows that Sokka and Katara talked so much shit about him the last time they saw each other.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMaybe it\u2019s not.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSokka doesn\u2019t know whether it\u2019s what they went through at the prison, or seeing his sister, or his ex-girlfriend betraying his sister to help them, or any or all of the people they brought back with them, but he can\u2019t take much more of it.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe corners Zuko after reminding Toph about the last time Aang tried to skip practice with her so she\u2019ll have him \n\nall day\n\n, and Katara\u2019s been so wrapped up with Dad that Sokka won\u2019t have to worry about her, and starts his deep, meaningful conversation with Zuko by tossing his swords at him.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cCome on, Princess,\u201d he taunts, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nZuko doesn\u2019t give in and merely dusts off his swords still safely in their sheaths and turns away.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t think so,\u201d he grumbles, which is a distinct upgrade from stony silence. \u201cNot today.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes today!\u201d Sokka leaps forward and Zuko throws his hands up, which is exactly what Sokka wanted him to do as it puts them into solid grabbing range. Which he immediately does, holding them snugly in his own and sidling closer. \u201cYou\u2019re spiraling.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou think I don\u2019t \n\nknow\n\n that?!\u201d Zuko snaps helplessly.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo let someone \n\nhelp you, \n\nyou dumb idiot.\u201d \n\nLet me help you\n\n is what Sokka doesn\u2019t say, but it\u2019s what he means. When he tugs on Zuko\u2019s hands the other boy goes as if on a tether, like he has no other choice, until he bumps him in the chest and goes stiff. Recoils. \u201cEasy, easy. I already said I\u2019m not gonna hurt you. We\u2019re not fighting, you\u2019re fine,\u201d Sokka says and releases one of them to reach up and curl around Zuko\u2019s shoulder and reel him in like a fish until he feels the other boy\u2019s heart pounding like a war drum against his chest.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s definitely not anything like a hug, because if it was, Toph would laugh herself sick. If it was a hug, then Zuko definitely would not be letting him do it, and he \n\ndefinitely \n\nwouldn\u2019t be leaning into the touch like he needs it.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe poor dumb fucker definitely needs it.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cCan you use your words?\u201d Sokka asks.\n\n\u00a0\n\nZuko cannot use his words, and Sokka gives him a squeeze until the energy vibrating off of him settles, then releases to give him space.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDad\u2019s gonna cook tonight,\u201d he tells him, \u201cIt\u2019d be nice if you showed up for it. I\u2019ll even sit across from him and save you a seat by me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nZuko\u2019s glare deepens, and he doesn\u2019t say anything. That evening, he shows up from whatever hole he dug himself down into and throws himself down next to Sokka. He doesn\u2019t even get snippety when he\u2019s wordlessly handed his jar of chili-grass-garlic paste, and Sokka doesn\u2019t think twice about reaching out to give his hand a squeeze.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s so proud of Zuko learning how to be people.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd then, Zuko goes stiff as a board, and Sokka realizes that he just grabbed his hand in front of everybody like Zuko\u2019s his new girlfriend, and he\u2019s gonna have an awkward conversation with Suki in his future judging by the look on her face.\u00a0 Katara looks like she\u2019s going to swallow her own tongue. He\u2019s definitely gonna have an awkward conversation with \n\nDad\n\n in the future judging by the look on \n\nhis\n\n face, and Aang and Toph...are \n\ngrinning.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s the most terrifying fucking thing that Sokka\u2019s ever seen.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSokka, you\u2019ve done it,\u201d Toph says, and Zuko suddenly looks like he regrets every single one of his life choices that brought him here, \u201cYou\u2019ve finally fucking done it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe pauses for dramatic effect like the monster she is.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c\n\nYou\u2019ve broken the seal.\n\n\u201d\n\n\u00a0\nZuko\u2019s not even got the time to get out the words broken the fucking what before he\u2019s got an airbender filling the empty space between him and Katara, and Toph bodily shoves herself between them on his other side. Aang grabs one arm, Toph grabs the other, and then as one borderline inhuman nightmare, they squish Zuko into a firebender sandwich.\n\u00a0\n\nA firebender sandwich who proceeds to blush red all the way down his collar and squirms where he sits.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe doesn\u2019t hate it, though, because if he did, he\u2019d definitely be climbing the walls to get away. Zuko accepts his fate with more dignity than Sokka could have ever expected. And, if he\u2019s reading it right, Zuko can\u2019t figure out which way he wants to lean and sways a little until they take mercy on him and squeeze him tight enough that he doesn\u2019t have to choose.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s adorable.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt should have been \n\nsuper weird, \n\nbut watching Zuko tuck his chin in and let a couple of very dangerous children cuddle him is cute as hell. What\u2019s better is that thanks to Sokka\u2019s newly-awakened Zuko Safety Sense, he can see clearly that far from being being uncomfortable, Zuko\u2019s calmer and more relaxed than he thinks he\u2019s ever seen him. And embarrassed, but that is nothing new.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHow did we get here?\u201d Sokka asks into the void. The void answers back with resignation and some wry humor and sounds a whole lot like Zuko,\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure but I think it had something to do with the Avatar.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nSokka\u2019s Safety Sense may be closely attuned to Zuko, but even he can sense danger that night when Hakoda stops him on the way to his room and asks for a few minutes. Sokka would give Dad all the minutes he had, but he has a sinking feeling he knows what this talk is about.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey\u2019ve been fighting the Fire Nation for practically forever and even though Dad\u2019s been around the world enough to know better, part of Sokka\u2019s worried that he\u2019s gonna try and beat up Zuko for being the The Enemy even though the guy had a substantial hand in rescuing him in the first place. Sokka\u2019s spent \n\nway \n\ntoo much time trying to help Zuko sort himself out to let him be murdered because somebody doesn\u2019t like where he\u2019s from. Obviously, Zuko wants nothing to do with Hakoda because of his own reasons, but he doesn\u2019t want his dad to think that that\u2019s because Zuko has a case of casual racism either.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd like, okay, the Fire Nation\u2019s done some terrible shit and honestly Zuko\u2019s done some pretty terrible shit, but when you compare it to what\u2019s been done to him, he comes off looking way better. What Sokka\u2019s learned to understand is that there are terrible people everywhere and good people everywhere, and where you come from has nothing to do with who you are.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSokka\u2019s surprised to discover how ready he is to correct any misunderstanding on the matter.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cListen, Dad, you can't be mad about Zuko,\u201d he starts in a rush before Hakoda can say anything, \u201cHe\u2019s not gonna do anything to hurt us ,and he\u2019s not like his dad at all and he\u2019s not...he\u2019s a total wreck, but he\u2019s a good dude. I didn\u2019t even ask him to help break you out of prison, but he did anyway, even though we could have \n\ndied\n\n and his horrible, terrifying sister could have gotten her hands on him, and he\u2019s been through so much garbage, Dad, that it\u2019s absolutely insane.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHakoda just blinks at him. Has he forgotten what words are? Has it been that long since they\u2019ve really talked that they don\u2019t even understand each other anymore?\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSon,\u201d he says very slowly, but Sokka talks over him before he can say anything else.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cLike, he doesn\u2019t know how to \n\ntouch\n\n people, Dad, and he wants to and somebody \n\nhurt him\n\n and now he\u2019s scared as shit \n\nall the time\n\n, and you can\u2019t be mad about him because I won\u2019t let you!\u201d\u00a0 That\u2019s his line in the sand and he\u2019s sticking to it.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nDad\u2019s boggling at him as if he\u2019s wondering who the hell Sokka is and where he came from.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSon,\u201d he tries again, and Sokka tries again, but Dad wised up since the last time and uses his own tactic on him by just talking right the fuck over him, \u201cI am not mad about Zuko.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re...you\u2019re not?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThat was not what he expected.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHakoda snorts at him, and shakes his head.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cFirst of all, son, you\u2019ve been a man of the tribe since I left, and you\u2019ve been more involved in this war than I would ever have liked, but you\u2019ve done it so well and I\u2019m unspeakably proud of you. If you trust Zuko, then I support you. But,\u201d he continues, \u201cYou are right that this talk is about him.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nSokka swallows hard.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat I was going to ask before you interrupted me was how long it\u2019s been that you\u2019ve been courting him and when you had planned on telling me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nSokka stares.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHakoda stares back.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSokka narrows his eyes, looking for the joke.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDad narrows his eyes right back.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c\n\nUm\n\n,\u201d is the only thing his mouth will make and it comes out in a horrifying squeak, \u201cWhy would you even \n\nsay that\n\n?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe all saw you holding his hand,\u201d Hakoda points out. Sokka resists the urge to laugh hysterically. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that you care for him, and he cares for you in return. I don\u2019t know how they do it in the Fire Nation, but it looks like courting to me. There\u2019s nothing wrong with you if you have feelings for men, it\u2019s perfectly normal and natural\u2014\u201c\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c\n\nI do not have \n\n\nfeelings\u2014\n\n\u201c\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c\n\nAnd\n\n,\u201d Hakoda continues aggressively, as if Sokka had said nothing, \u201cWhat kind of father would I be if I didn\u2019t support my only son in his quest for happiness? And then to find out that my \n\nonly son\n\n thought that I was the kind of man who would beat up his boyfriend?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nSokka has to reach out and grab the wall because that\u2019s where he\u2019s going to die, right here, right now. He can\u2019t believe how completely wrong Dad\u2019s got it, how \n\ntotally wrong he is, \n\nbecause what the fuck, he\u2019s definitely not \n\ndating \n\nZuko. And to be honest, a part of him warms because in the scheme of things, he\u2019s so lucky to have a father who\u2019s not complete and fiery garbage, who loves him and supports him even though he\u2019s absolutely, definitely wrong about what he\u2019s supporting.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWith that in mind, Sokka drags himself off the wall and throws himself at his dad, wrapping his arms around him and holding tight, lets himself feel small and safe. There\u2019s no hesitation in Hakoda hugging him back just as tight.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThey really messed him up, Dad,\u201d he whispers somewhere into Hakoda\u2019s chest. It feels good to say something to A Real Adult. \u201cI\u2019m not dating him and if I was, I promise that I\u2019d let you know. I\u2019m just...helping him.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBy holding his hands.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nSokka feels his cheeks burn.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt helps him calm down!\u201d He defends himself, \u201cSomebody touches that guy out of nowhere and they\u2019re gonna go down, friendly or not.\u201d What Sokka doesn\u2019t say is how much his soft, squishy heart hurts when he thinks about how something that\u2019s supposed to make you feel good has been so ruined for Zuko, but he thinks Hakoda hears it anyway if the way he pets his head is any indication. \u201cI just...I want to show him that not everybody wants to hurt him.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIn that case, you\u2019re a very good friend to him.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDad \n\ntotally\n\n doesn\u2019t believe him but Sokka will take what he can get.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good friend to us, too.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nSokka cannot \n\nbelieve\n\n they actually made it.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe thinks he might honestly be in shock from it all, but the bottom of his stomach is stubbornly cold when he thinks of what might have gone down in the caldera where the palace resides. Where Zuko and Katara went to have words with Azula.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s so terrified of what he\u2019s going to find when he gets there, and not even Dad\u2019s steadying hand on his shoulder is enough to quell his anxiety because he can feel the minute trembles running between them and he knows that Dad\u2019s just as afraid. Probably not \n\nso\n\n much for Zuko (other than he\u2019s still determined that Sokka\u2019s trying to court him) but definitely for Katara.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAzula is one crazy piece of work.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s been the longest twenty-four hours of his life, but Sokka knows that, broken leg or no, if he stops now he doesn\u2019t know when he\u2019ll start again, and he can\u2019t stop until he knows what happened in the capital. Toph\u2019s equally antsy in the airship, and Aang vacillates from elated to sick with worry by turn. Iroh\u2026Iroh looks like he\u2019s halfway through his grieving process and got stuck. He hasn\u2019t said a word since they picked him up. He hasn\u2019t taken a sip of tea, hasn\u2019t done anything but twist his hands in his robes and breathe deeply in a way that Sokka finds extremely familiar.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s Zuko\u2019s brand of deep breathing, he recognizes, that thing he does when he\u2019s on the verge of flying right off the fucking handle and needs to sit on himself.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey got the Fire Lord, but what of the rest?\n\n\u00a0\n\nIs there even going to be anyone to sit on the throne when the dust clears?\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt feels like forever that they sit in nauseating silence until somebody (Suki, he thinks? She took the flying shift after his) hollers that they\u2019re nearing Capital City, and that they should be landing within a half hour. Sokka scrambles to the nearest window to look. Iroh doesn\u2019t move.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe good news is that nothing seems to be on fire.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe bad news is that nothing seems to be on fire?\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe can\u2019t even spare a thought to the pain in his leg, wrapped and cast to keep it still, as they maneuver the airship right down to land in front of the palace, where Sokka is sure that airships definitely aren\u2019t supposed to be parked, and clamber or hobble out of it. The city is dead silent.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nMaybe the rest of the world has been shocked into stillness in the aftermath.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd then, suddenly, the palace doors slam open with a great booming crash. There\u2019s Zuko standing in the doorway wearing loose red and gold robes that don\u2019t even pretend to hide the bandages wrapping his entire upper body, and \n\nsnow and sea\n\n, there\u2019s Katara behind him, safe and sound and perfectly, beautifully irritated. Sokka\u2019s so fucking happy he could start crying, because somehow they got lucky enough that \n\neveryone he cared about lived\n\n. Zuko stares at the lot of them like he can\u2019t believe it either, and then very slowly the biggest, dopiest, sunshiniest grin spreads all over his whole face. Sokka\u2019s never seen that kind of look on him before. Zuko looks like hell, but that doesn\u2019t stop him from throwing himself down the palace steps three at a time with a focus.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cCan you \n\nat least\n\n slow down so you don\u2019t wreck all your healing progress?\u201d Katara snaps at him and hustles herself after him, and Sokka feels like he gets hit with a tank when Zuko slams into him without hesitation, picking him up off his feet and crushing him to his chest, then doing the same to Toph, Aang, and even Suki. Then, Zuko looks up to see his uncle standing behind them with Hakoda and \n\nflings\n\n himself into his arms.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe old firebender rocks back on his feet from the impact, but catches Zuko easily, like he weighs nothing, folding him close and holding him so tightly Sokka thinks for a minute that Iroh\u2019s gonna just pick him up and run away with him and never come back. He doesn\u2019t do that, though, and Sokka takes the time to squeeze the hell out of his baby sister (and Aang too because why the hell not, kid deserves a few more hugs too, and if Toph and Suki get in on it too then that\u2019s totally fine) because all the optimism in the world wouldn\u2019t take away his fears of \n\nwhat if, what if\n\n. Then, Dad\u2019s there holding onto both of them, and things finally feel \n\nright.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe hears a noise from the Zuko end of things, and he feels wrong to look at something that\u2019s clearly a private moment happening right there on the lawn, and Sokka goes still. And he realizes that at some point Zuko started laughing into Iroh\u2019s chest and now it\u2019s like he can\u2019t stop. It gets louder and higher and more hysterical, and Sokka realizes with abject \n\nhorror\n\n that Zuko\u2019s burst into tears and is now sobbing into Uncle\u2019s robes like his heart\u2019s been broken into pieces. The old dragon looks shocked out of his mind and stricken like his own heart\u2019s been snapped right along with Zuko\u2019s.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSokka manages to peel himself away from his own personal cuddle puddle and makes a beeline for them because he cannot \n\nhandle\n\n that, and drapes his whole body over Zuko\u2019s back, presses him down until he\u2019s squished between them like an emotional support sandwich.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay, you\u2019re gonna be fine,\u201d Sokka mumbles nonsensically into the nape of Zuko\u2019s neck and pets his hair until the noise dies in his throat and all he can do is shake. This is going to do exactly nothing for Dad\u2019s opinion on their relationship, and he can\u2019t make himself give a shit.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIroh\u2019s got an awfully interesting look on his face, though. Not totally unlike Hakoda\u2019s that first night he saw his son grab Zuko by the hand and hold.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDad needs to quit smirking; it\u2019s not cute at all.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSomehow, the lot of them manage to drag themselves into the palace where a whole lot of painfully respectful and extremely uncomfortable house staff shuffle them all into a parlor and push food and drinks and cushions on them. Sokka doesn\u2019t miss how Zuko ends up with a massive blanket bundled up around him that makes him look kind of like an exhausted caterpillar who needs to go back to bed. Iroh manages to goad Hakoda into a game of pai sho on the other side of the room where he can surreptitiously keep an eye on his nephew. Being annihilated by a smiling, tea-drinking tile shark is exactly what Dad gets for all of his teasing.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey talk and laugh and tell stories for what feels like forever, until they\u2019re so full of food that none of them could eat another thing, and all the self proclaimed grown ups have walked away to be boring or to take a nap. Sokka leans over to curl into Zuko\u2019s heavily blanketed, delightfully soft side. Zuko, who\u2019s being bracketed by Toph to his left, Katara with Suki\u2019s head in her lap, and Aang being rude as hell and laying on top of all of them.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHow did we get here?\u201d Sokka asks absently into the void. Once again, the void answers back with resignation and some wry humor and sounds a whole lot like Zuko,\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure but I think it had something to do with the Avatar.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nTonight\u2019s a bad night.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe comet is just a few days out and they\u2019re all about to crawl out of their skin with stress. Aang\u2019s missing and for the first time Sokka\u2019s brain is filled with the static of \n\nnot knowing\n\n. He\u2019s the plan guy. He always has \n\nsome\n\n kind of plan, and right now his plan stops at \n\nfind an adult, \n\nbecause that\u2019s all he\u2019s got right now.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing, is finding a goddamn adult, who happens to be former General Iroh. This and not just his constant struggle with existence on a human kind of level is Zuko\u2019s current malfunction.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSokka knows that their relationship might not necessarily be complicated, but it is fraught and they didn\u2019t part on good terms. He also knows that Zuko is \n\nscared shitless\n\n of seeing Iroh again. Nyla\u2019s leading then to Ba Sing Se, another place that Sokka never thought he'd be going again. Even a shirshu needs to rest, so they\u2019ve set up camp about a day\u2019s move from the city, ish. They should only have to do this once more.\n\n\u00a0\n\nKatara\u2019s crawled into her bedroll, definitely not crying quietly before slipping off into sleep. Toph\u2019s closed herself off in her rock tent. Suki...Sokka doesn\u2019t even know where she\u2019s gone off to.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s a bad night.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut he\u2019s still got Zuko who looks like he can\u2019t decide whether he wants to run away and never come back or just burn the world to the ground and start over.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cCan you please just stop pacing?\u201d Sokka mumbles into quiet.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the point?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe point is that the pacing is giving me a headache, and I can\u2019t deal, so either\n\n go away\n\n or come over here so we feel awful together.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSokka doesn\u2019t have the give for this. All this time, all he can think of is that this was what people felt a hundred years ago, when they needed the Avatar, and \n\nhe wasn\u2019t there\n\n. He wants to have faith in Aang, but the only thing he knows is that Aang\u2019s not here. They\u2019ve got no choice but to do this thing without him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd Sokka feels \n\nguilty.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s not stupid, he knows that Aang\u2019s crisis was kickstarted with trying to teach him to kill, and why the hell had Sokka thought that Melon Lord was a good plan?\n\n\u00a0\n\nAt least Zuko\u2019s plan had also sucked, Sokka thinks with a tiny bit of vindication. He\u2019s at least not sitting here on top of Shame Mountain all by himself.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe prince in question throws himself roughly to the ground next to Sokka, and it\u2019s practice and a borderline desperate need to just connect with someone that has Sokka leaning into him and curling an arm around his waist. Zuko freezes for just a moment but accepts the contact, tentatively wraps his own arm around Sokka\u2019s shoulders to pull him flush against his side. Sokka\u2019s used to being the one who comforts, and it\u2019s a funny role reversal, but it feels \n\nreally good\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\nZuko\u2019s a solid guy, all muscle and bone, but he knows well how to be gentle, and the way with which he handles Sokka right now is so gentle that it almost hurts.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThis fuckin\u2019 sucks.\u201d The words are way harsher than Zuko\u2019s being right now, rough and raspy. Sokka remembers that until Aang showed back up, Zuko had been on a ship for three years. Maybe he misses it.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt really, \n\nreally \n\nsucks,\u201d Sokka agrees vehemently with a nod that shakes his whole upper body, and lets himself settle into the natural warmth that firebenders give off, lets himself take what Zuko\u2019s willing to give. \u201cI\u2019m trying so hard not to be angry.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAt Aang?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c...yeah.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nBecause what it comes down to is that yeah, Sokka is kind of angry with Aang for putting them here but more than that, he\u2019s mad at himself. He thinks that out of anyone here, Zuko understands that. Of course, Zuko doesn\u2019t say that he understands, but the way he tilts his head to let his cheek press against Sokka\u2019s hair says enough about it.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat if Uncle doesn\u2019t want to see me?\u201d Zuko whispers so quietly that if Sokka hadn\u2019t been waiting for him to speak, he wouldn\u2019t have even heard him.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe will.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBut what if he \n\ndoesn\u2019t?\n\n\u201d Zuko\u2019s voice takes on a nearly hysterical lilt that makes him sound about half his age. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026how can I believe that? I don\u2019t even want to see me most of the time. He spent \n\nso much time \n\ntrying to help me, and I was so ungrateful, and couldn\u2019t even choose him when it mattered.\u201d These words are poison, and Sokka wonders how long Zuko\u2019s been poisoning himself on them with nowhere for them to go. \u201cI tried...on the day of Black Sun, I tried to break him out of the Fire Lord\u2019s prison.\u201d Not \n\nmy father\n\n. It hasn\u2019t been \n\nmy father\n\n in a while. \u201cBut he was already gone.\u201d This has clearly been eating at him.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how the Fire Nation does things,\u201d Sokka says, soothed almost against his will by not being so \n\nalone\n\n right now, \u201cBut when someone we love does us wrong, and comes to us and apologizes, we forgive them. And your uncle \n\nloves you, \n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way he won\u2019t at least want to see you.\u201d Sokka knows that the only way to allay Zuko\u2019s fears is for him to face them, but that doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t try and help. \u201cAnd if things go badly, you\u2019ve still got us.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nYou\u2019ve still got me\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat Zuko needs to hear is that his uncle is not his father, and Sokka can\u2019t in good conscience say that without feeling like he\u2019s lying somehow because he doesn\u2019t know. He wants to think so because if he\u2019s wrong, he knows that Zuko won\u2019t survive it. He \n\nknows\n\n. And Zuko will fight and do what he has to because that\u2019s what he knows how to do, but on the inside his heart will probably just curl up and die. So Sokka has to believe that Iroh will want to see Zuko, and he had to try and believe that Aang will pull through in the end even though it all seems so fucking hopeless.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful,\u201d Zuko says finally. He doesn\u2019t really have a normal speaking voice, Sokka\u2019s noticed; he\u2019s either very quiet, or he\u2019s yelling until he\u2019s hoarse and very little in between, but this is the closest he\u2019s come to it. \u201cFor all of you, but especially for\u2014 for \n\nyou\n\n. I wouldn\u2019t be here without you, and I\u2019m grateful.\u201d The funny thing about Zuko is that while everything embarrasses him, he can somehow manage to make the most horrifyingly forthright, honest words come out of his mouth without the slightest bit of shame. Sokka couldn\u2019t have managed it without at least hiding behind a bush as he said it.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe also can\u2019t help but give Zuko a firm squeeze around the middle because now he\u2019s \n\nfeeling things\n\n, and he thinks he\u2019s gonna explode if he doesn\u2019t do something. He tries to put all his care into that squeeze, because Zuko might be great at saying mortifying things, but Sokka tries to avoid it at all cost.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cZuko, listen,\u201d Sokka says, \u201cWhen we win, I\u2019m gonna hug the absolute shit out of you. And not before! Otherwise it\u2019s a pre-ward, and we might be fucked. When we beat this thing and all come out alive, I am giving you the greatest hug of your life.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe kind of expects Zuko to laugh it off or loosen up, but what he doesn\u2019t expect is for the other boy\u2019s \n\nwhole fucking face \n\nto soften into something so gentle Sokka can\u2019t even look at it, so he buries his own in Zuko\u2019s shoulder in a misguided attempt to pretend he didn\u2019t see it. Zuko\u2019s arm around him is warm and heavy and solid, and his hand comes up to the nape of Sokka\u2019s neck, squeezes, and holds so softly that it\u2019s like it\u2019s not even there.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll look forward to it,\u201d Zuko says so honestly that Sokka has to believe he\u2019s not kidding.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s still a bad night, but it\u2019s better together.\n"
