    "text": "Izuku was so excited! UA, the best school he could possibly get into, and he was going there! As a student this time! He had already thanked Nedzu a thousand times for letting him in on recommendation. Not that he wouldn\u2019t have done well on the entrance exam, it was, well, more like he still wanted other people to get in. His kind were really rare, and he was a smart one, so when Nedzu had taken him under his wing (Paw?) he couldn\u2019t have been more grateful. Learning his powers hadn\u2019t been easy, both sets of them.\u00a0\nBut now he was here! Really here! And oh no he was going to be sick. Too many nerves. What if they didn\u2019t like him? Creature discrimination hadn\u2019t been a real danger in years, but it still made him nervous. Especially when his kind were already a rarity.\u00a0\nHe stopped at the door that was much bigger than he was. Probably for creatures that were bigger than the average human. Ok. He could do this. He wasn\u2019t going to be sick. He was going to walk in and meet the people he\u2019d be spending the next three years with. Ok.\u00a0\nSo Izuku took a deep breath, and opened the door. Only to be greeted with two angry mages. The door was promptly slammed shut. Nope. Not dealing with that. He did not want to deal with Kacchan right now. Not when his wild magic was already firing off in his palms. And he recognized the other one, the boy with innate superspeed. He was the younger brother of Ingenium, Iida Tensei.\u00a0\nSee, in their world, nearly everyone has a type of magic or power, usually called a Quirk. There were different variants, all of which were interesting. First were the normal people that had magic. They had a designated type and couldn\u2019t perform it outside of that, but everyone was interesting and exceedingly interesting. They made up the most amount of magic users. Second were the people who had mutations because of their magic, mostly to use it properly. Third, and final, were the creatures. Beings that held a resemblance to humans and were either full or part creature of some sort.\u00a0Their powers could\u00a0technically be called a Quirk, but it wasn't especially accurate.\u00a0\nIzuku was the third type.\u00a0\n\u201cOh, hello!\u201d A chipper voice piped up from Izuku\u2019s right. He turned, and saw a girl. \u201cYou\u2019re in 1-A too, right?\u201d\n\u201cUh, y-yeah.\u201d\n\u201cSooo why\u2019re you standing out here?\u201d\n\u201cI, er, people a-are fighting. I d-didn\u2019t want to try and go pass, passed them.\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re here to socialize, you can leave.\u201d\nIzuku stifled his yelp as something talked from the floor. Looking down, he saw his teacher. He had met Aizawa-sensei before, but him and his sleeping bag (which Izuku mentally dubbed the caterpillar cocoon) still managed to surprise him a lot. He also knew he found it amusing to see students reactions to it on the first day.\n\u201cGet to your seats,\u201d Aizawa-sensei told them. Izuku hurried inside, finding himself behind Kacchan. The girl was on the other side of the classroom.\u00a0\nAizawa then rolled to the front of the classroom and stood up, somehow still inside his sleeping bag, before unzipping it and stepping out. The rest of the class was silent, though Izuku had a feeling Kacchan wanted to turn around and blast him into tomorrow.\u00a0\n\u201cI am your teacher.\u201d Aizawa-sensei grabbed a box of uniforms from behind his desk and set them on top. \u201cPut these on and meet me outside, we\u2019re having a test.\u201d\nThe class murmured amongst themselves when Aizawa-sensei left. Izuku just sighed, and retrieved a gym uniform. Everyone else followed his lead to the lockers. Being taught by Nedzu for the better part of two years definitely helped his ability to navigate UA\u2019s halls.\u00a0\nOnce outside Izuku began to mentally panic when Aizawa announced they were doing what was essentially fitness testing, but using whatever power they had at their disposal. Izuku was panicking because his wasn\u2019t suited for this sort of thing. Well...maybe? It depended on what the guidelines were really.\u00a0\nHe then watched Kacchan launch his ball over 700 meters away, and suddenly really wanted to go home.\u00a0\nSome of the exercises were alright. Stretching has always been super easy for him. The long jump wasn\u2019t the worst, but it could have been better. For the dash he experimented with his teleportation. As far as his classmates were concerned he disappeared in a flurry of pink and red, and then reappeared at the other end with a time of one second. Izuku avoided Kacchan like the plague after that stunt.\u00a0\nThe ball throw...did not go as he expected. His powers didn\u2019t help with almost any of the tests. He had to do something to get his ranking up, or he would be expelled. Aizawa-sensei wouldn\u2019t hesitate just because Nedzu let him in on recommendation. So he did the only thing he could think of, using the power he had been given.\u00a0\nHis arm lit up with green sparks as he wound it back. With as much force as he could muster, he threw the ball.\u00a0\nAnd it landed only a couple dozen meters away. Izuku knew what happened. He knew who his teacher was afterall, and if anything was sort of expecting this to happen.\u00a0\n\u201cNo breaking bones, Problem Child,\u201d Aizawa-sensei scolded, tossing a new ball to him. \u201cYou would be useless in the field if that happens. You break your arm and you\u2019re expelled, understand?\u201d\nIzuku nodded, catching the new ball. Ok. He could do this. If he wanted to get a good score he still needed to use One for All, but he couldn\u2019t break his whole arm.\nWell, Aizawa-sensei never said anything about his finger.\u00a0\nWith another wind up, the ball soared off into the sky. Eventually it landed, showing a score just above Kacchan\u2019s. Said Kacchan almost immediately tried to attack him.\u00a0\n\u201cHOW DID YOU DO THAT, HUH DEKU?!\u201d He screamed, flying through the air on the power of his explosions.\u00a0\nGray scarves wrapped around and restrained Kacchan, holding him in the air where he was. His explosions stopped. Izuku uncurled from his flinch to watch the spectacle. Aizawa-sensei\u2019s magic cancelling really\u00a0came in handy for being a hero teacher.\n\u201cI will not have you attacking your classmates, Bakugou,\u201d he said calmly, setting the seething boy on the ground.\u00a0\n\u201cBUT HE CHEATED! THE FUCKER IS A USELESS CAT MORPH!\u201d\n\u201cI assure you, he did not. If he did then he would be expelled.\u201d\nKacchan yelled incoherent before finally backing off. Izuku let himself relax slightly, and merged with the crowd again. His finger was broken, but it was better than his whole arm. He was told he had high pain tolerance anyway.\u00a0\nThe rest of the tests were relatively simple. Izuku didn\u2019t have anything that could help with them. At least nothing he wanted to show off.\u00a0\nThat was, until he saw one of his classmates sneaking towards the group of girls. Izuku remembered his name was Mineta, and he was suddenly very high on his list of \u201cpeople to watch out for.\u201d He stared intently as the tiny grape rat edged his way closer to some of the girls, who hadn\u2019t noticed him.\u00a0\nIzuku snuck up to the purple boy, and stood directly behind him. \u201cWhat\u2019re you doing, Mineta?\u201d\nMineta jumped, and spun around. He calmed down when he saw it was Izuku, but the idea that he would be tense in the first place was discerning.\u00a0\n\u201cOh, Midoriya, it\u2019s just you,\u201d he said. \u201cHey, you wanna help me?\u201d\n\u201cWith...what?\u201d\nMineta got a disgusting look on his face. One Izuku didn\u2019t like one bit. \u201cGetting a look at the girls.\u201d\nIzuku scowled down at the midget, who was grinning up at him. Disgusting, he thought. Izuku opened his mouth.\u00a0\nIn an instant of pink, Mineta was gone. The noise seemed to attract the attention of everyone else, or at least the girls and Aizawa-senei. One look at Izuku\u2019s puffed cheeks and their teacher sighed heavily.\u00a0\n\u201cMidoriya, spit him out,\u201d he sighed in exasperation. The girls watched in interest. \u201cNedzu did not teach you that just to eat your classmates.\u201d\n\u201cBuf he \u2018as \u2018eing gross!\u201d Izuku cried, muffled by his cheeks.\n\u201cAnd I can deal with that properly. Now spit him out.\u201d\nIzuku grumbled, but spat Mineta out onto the ground. No one got a good look at how he had done it, too focused on the boy on the ground. Mineta was covered in slimy looking spit and small cuts. He was laying on the ground about and complaining about how gross it had been. The whole class stared at Izuku in shock, while said boy refused to look up from the ground. More annoyed with Mineta than embarrassed.\u00a0\n\u201cMineta, what were you doing that made Izuku do that,\u201d Aizawa demanded.\u00a0\n\u201cI was just trying to look at the girls!\u201d He wailed.\u00a0\nThe girls all glanced over at Izuku in surprise, who was glaring daggers at Mineta. The purple boy crawled as far away from Izuku as he could. Aizawa-sensei sighed once again, and picked Mineta up by the back on his uniform.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re finishing the tests. Mineta, stay away from the girls. Izuku, no more eating people.\u201d\n\u201cYes Sensei,\u201d they all said, some more begrudging than others.\nThe day went decently smoothly from there. People whispered about Izuku, but that was nothing new. The subject was different this time though. In middle school it had been mostly how useless a simple cat morph power was. Here, in UA, it was apparently going to be how he \u201cate\u201d his classmate after he acted gross. And how he could teleport when he was a \u201csimple cat morph.\u201d Izuku nearly started laughing. While part of what he was was a cat morph, he was anything but simple.\u00a0\nThe scores were displayed for all to see. Izuku wasn\u2019t last, and he finally let himself fully relax. Mineta, however, was. Aizawa expelled him on the spot, citing his behavior and lack of creativity with his power. Had he acted differently, Izuku would have asked him how his power worked. It had to be a type of magic mutation, since Mineta himself looked like a Dwarf or Gnome.\u00a0\nThey walked back to the classroom. Some of them quiet at the prospect that someone had been expelled so soon, and others in contemplation. The girls were happy Mineta was gone, at the very least. Izuku felt he had done something good by helping get rid of the pervert. Even if Aizawa-sensei didn\u2019t let Izuku send him to another dimension.\u00a0\nOnce everyone had grabbed a syllabus they started chattering. Izuku kept well away from Kacchan. Instead gravitating towards the girl he had met that morning and the younger Iida.\u00a0\n\u201cHey, Midoriya, how did you do that this morning?\u201d The girl, Uraraka he learned, asked.\n\u201cYes, I would like to know as well,\u201d Iida said a bit too loudly. It drew the attention of others, and Izuku knew they were paying attention to him now too.\u00a0\n\u201cEr, my powers a-are very complicated,\u201d he stuttered.\n\u201cCOMPLICATED MY ASS,\u201d Kacchan yelled, stomping up and grabbing Izuku\u2019s shirt collar. \u201cYOU\u2019RE A WEAK CAT MORPH, DEKU. HOW THE HELL DID SOMEONE LIKE YOU DO THAT!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not, not j-just a c-c-\u201d\nThe door slid open to reveal their teacher. Everyone immediately stopped what they were doing. Even Kacchan, reluctantly, let go and sat at his desk. Izuku let out a breath he had been holding and followed their example.\n\u201cMineta has been expelled, as you all saw. I will not tolerate inappropriate behavior in this class. Same goes for attacking classmates. This is your first and final warning to not follow previous examples.\u201d Aizawa-sensei paused, sweeping his gaze over the classroom. \u201cWith that said, you may leave.\u201d\nThe first day was done. One student expelled, and one that held a grudge against Izuku.\u00a0\nThis year was going to be fun\nIt was supposed to be a normal field trip. It was supposed to be a normal field trip. There were not supposed to be villains. There wasn\u2019t supposed to be a thing that looked like creatures and magic had been sewn together into something resembling Frankenstein\u2019s Monster. Izuku could nearly see the waves of clashing magic rolling off of it.\u00a0\nThey tried to leave. Tried to escape while Aizawa-sensei held the villains off. Izuku wanted so badly to just run back and help his teacher. He couldn\u2019t take on that many villains, he knew that. Even before Nedzu had offered to help him, he had known about the pro hero Eraserhead. He knew he fought without physical magic or having creature mutations. His capture scarf was one of the only weapons he used. Against a hoard of villains with all types of magic? The odds weren\u2019t entirely in his favor.\u00a0\nA villain appeared in front of the class. Murky and dark and made of mist. A physical mutation from their Quirk, Izuku guessed. But now was not the time to get into the physics of Quirks and magic. Right now was the time to try and find a way out.\u00a0\nIzuku couldn\u2019t do anything as Kacchan and Kirishima launched themselves at the villain. They fell through him, landing harshly on the concrete. Izuku thought he caught a glimpse of metal, but he didn\u2019t have time to think about it. The mist expanded around them, blanketing the whole class in darkness.\u00a0\nAnd then Izuku was falling. When the darkness finally receded he found himself falling towards water. Why of all things did it have to be water?! He hated water. To be fair, he was technically part cat, so it made sense. Didn\u2019t make the situation any better.\u00a0\nHe lashed out when he hit the surface, trying to stay afloat. He knew how to swim, but that didn\u2019t mean he liked it. Especially when he saw a shark villain swimming towards him. Nopenopenopenopenope big nopity nope.\u00a0\nHe was suddenly yanked from the water and found himself on the deck of a ship. Tsuyu landed not a second later.\u00a0\n\u201cYou ok, Midoriya?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cY-yeah, I\u2019m fine,\u201d he replied, vigorously shaking his limbs to get rid of the water. \u201cAny idea how we\u2019re getting off this ship?\u201d\n\u201cNot currently, ribbit.\u201d\nIzuku hesitantly walked to the edge of the ship and looked into the water. It made him a bit nauseous, but he had to do it. There were villains, at least a dozen of them. Way too many for the two of them to take on themselves. Izuku knew what he had to do, but it wouldn\u2019t be pleasant.\u00a0\n\u201cOk, so, h-how well are you w-with gross things?\u201d He asked, turning away from the water.\n\u201cAlright I think, ribbit. Why?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I c-can teleport us out of, of here, b-but I would need to...um, e-essentially need to, uh...eat, you.\u201d\n\u201cLike you did with Mineta?\u201d\n\u201cY-yeah. It might be a bit, bit gross, but it would g-get us off the ship.\u201d\n\u201cOk.\u201d\n\u201cOk?\u201d\n\u201cIf that\u2019s the only way you can think of, ribbit, then I think it will be ok.\u201d\n\u201cS-sure. Ok. Just, um, don\u2019t freak out.\u201d\nIzuku was hesitant to do anything. He had been raised to keep his stronger powers contained and sealed up inside of him. Then when he actually wanted to use them, they had been out of control. Which is why Nedzu had offered to teach him. Now he had a good grasp on his powers, but a lifetime of hiding them made him reluctant to reveal them to anyone.\u00a0\nWith a deep breath, he teleported the two of them. Just outside of the giant pool of water. Tsuyu was set on the ground almost instantly, not covering in spit like Mineta had been. She did look a bit shell shocked though.\u00a0\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t kidding, ribbit,\u201d was all she said.\u00a0\n\u201cUh, y-yeah. S-sorry about th-that.\u201d\n\u201cAt least I didn\u2019t come out looking like Mineta.\u201d\n\u201cHe deserved it,\u201d Izuku said simply, scowling for a second. It quickly melted off when he looked out from their cover.\u00a0\nAizawa-sensei was beneath the hulking abomination. Arm bent in an angle it definitely should not be bent at. His other one was bleeding and looked...cracked? The man covered in hands was laughing, and the mist-man was besides him.\n\u201cKurogiri, did you take care of Thirteen?\u201d The hand-man asked.\n\u201cThey have been incapacitated, Tomura Shigaraki, though a student managed to escape.\u201d\nShigaraki growled, scratching furiously at his neck and muttering to himself. Izuku watched, frozen, as the abomination didn\u2019t move, but neither did Aizawa-sensei.\u00a0\n\u201cThe boss isn\u2019t even here. This level is corrupted. Let\u2019s go.\u201d\nIzuku almost sagged with relief. They were leaving? Just like that? And someone had gotten out, so reinforcements were probably on the way. They would be alright.\n\u201cBut before we go,\u201d Shigaraki said, stopping his scratching. He turned, and stared directly at Izuku and Tsuyu. Izuku had never felt fear like he did in that moment. \u201cLet\u2019s leave the heroes a message. Nomu.\u201d\nIzuku had hardly a second to realize what was happening. The abomination, the Nomu, was on the two of them in an instant, swinging it\u2019s oversized fist with speed that shouldn\u2019t be possible for something so big. It wasn\u2019t aiming at Izuku though, no, it was aiming for Tsuyu.\u00a0\nIzuku didn\u2019t think, only moved. One moment Tsuyu was just starting to turn and look behind her, the next Izuku was there in place of her. The impact shattered at least a few bones. Good thing he was more resilient than normal humans.\u00a0\nHis back hit a tree, and then another tree, before he finally slumped to the ground. He felt more than heard the Nomu coming after him.\u00a0\nCall it instinct or panic or adrenaline. Anything you will, but now out of sight, he let himself loose.\u00a0\nThings came out of his mouth. Jagged teeth and tentacles that logically should not fit where they did. Jaws that expanded and multiplied and grew. All of it descended on the Nomu, and swallow it whole.\u00a0\nIzuku stumbled forward as he returned to normal. He could hear Shigaraki shrieking somewhere for the Nomu to come back. Seeing as it had just been eaten, it decidedly could not. Izuku shook his head and crept out of the trees.\u00a0\nIt was then that the doors to the USJ burst open. All Might stepped in in all his glory. Izuku, no matter how many times he saw the man, was still in awe.\u00a0\nThe villains turned to All Might. Shigaraki laughed, though it sounded more like a hyena cackle. \u201cFinally, the boss arrives! Nomu!\u201d\nNothing happened. Izuku stayed where he was. The Nomu couldn\u2019t hear Shigaraki. All Might zipped down, retrieving Tsuyu and getting her to safety. He did the same for Izuku a second later. One moment\u00a0he was in the bushes and the next he was standing at the top of the stairs.\u00a0\nShigaraki and Kurogiri quickly retreated once they realized the Nomu wasn\u2019t coming back. The class was quickly brought back together. No one was hurt too badly, which lifted a lot of their spirits.\u00a0\nThe police arrives not long after the other pros did. Each kid was brought to the side to be questioned. Izuku was one of the last, which gave him time to calm down and think about what exactly had just happened.\u00a0\nThe fact was that he ate the Nomu, a creature meant to destroy All Might. And he had eaten it. Even if it was being held in a pocket dimension right now, and was alive.\u00a0He could technically choose to actually eat it, but he really didn't want to do that.\u00a0\nHe was called to questioning after a while. An officer with a notepad stood with him near the edge of the police car line.\n\u201cOk kid, just need to ask you a few questions. That alright?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cY-yeah.\u201d\n\u201cGood. First, did you catch any information that could be useful in finding the villains responsible for this?\u201d\n\u201cUm, I, I heard their names. One was Kurogiri, he was tall and made of black mist that could t-teleport things. The second was called Shigaraki, he had, um, blue hair. He, he had a b-bunch of hands as a costume too.\u201d\n\u201cOk. Second, what happened after this Kurogiri separated your class?\u201d\n\u201cI was dropped into, into the shipwreck z-zone with Tsuyu Asui. I used m-my...powers to teleport us o-out. Then we, we saw Aizawa-sensei get hurt by the, by the Nomu.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard about the Nomu, but no one knows where it went. Did you see what happened to it?\u201d\n\u201cI ate it.\u201d\nThe officer looked up from their notes to stare at him. He blinked back at them innocently. \u201cYou...ate it.\u201d\n\u201cI can spit it out if you need it back. I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll attack without orders.\u201d\n\u201cUh, yeah, give me a sec, kid. Stay there.\u201d\nThe police officer ran behind a few police cars. Izuku waited patiently. They came back a few minutes later with a man dressed in a trench coat.\n\u201cHello there,\u201d the man greeted. Izuku waved. \u201cNow, I\u2019m just here to confirm something, apparently. You said you know what happened to the Nomu.\u201d\n\u201cYes. It, it was trying to attack me, so I ate it. I can give it back if you want it.\u201d\nBoth officers blinked in shock. The first one spoke into his communicator. Another minute went by before a whole squad of police came marching up.\u00a0\n\u201cYou said you could...spit it up, right?\u201d The second man said. Izuku nodded. \u201cOk then, go ahead, I guess.\u201d\nIzuku took a step away from any people, and spat the Nomu back up. It landed on the ground and didn\u2019t move, though it wasn\u2019t dead. It was, however, covered in spit. He had to make a conscious effort to not get stuff on things if he wanted to do that.\u00a0\nHe got to return to his class without anything else to do. No one had seen him eat or spit out the Nomu. It was alright, the danger had passed. For now, at least.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBonus:\n\u201cWait, so you\u2019re telling me, that \u2018sunshine smile and looks like a fluffy cat\u2019 Midoriya, teleported you...by eating you.\u201d Uraraka gawked at Tsuyu, trying to process what she had just heard. Midoriya was getting interviewed right now, so she couldn\u2019t demand answers from him.\u00a0\n\u201cYes, ribbit. It was odd, but I didn\u2019t come out covered in slime like Mineta, ribbit, so I\u2019m alright.\u201d\nUraraka had one thought and one thought only. Just what the heck is Midoriya?!\nThe sports festival was one of the most hyped up events of the year in Japan. With so many different Quirks, it was no wonder why. Izuku himself watched them almost religiously every year. Though the third years had the most attention, the first and second years were still popular.\u00a0\nIzuku was nervous. He had to go out and show off to the whole country. It wasn\u2019t just that, but it ran the risk of someone figuring out what he was. Not...necessarily a bad thing, but it still made him anxious. At least he could probably get by with only using One for All.\nThen Todoroki challenged him. Well, more like stating he was better than everyone, but Izuku saw the meaning behind it. He fired right back. Kacchan was angry, but didn\u2019t get to say much before they were called out.\u00a0\nThe first competition was interesting. An obstacle race. Izuku couldn\u2019t use his normal powers, and One for All still wasn\u2019t exactly easy to use yet, so he improvised. Shooting himself like a rocket might not have been what he imagined himself doing when he arrived that morning, but it worked.\u00a0\nRound two was fun. Izuku was explicitly told he could not, in fact, eat the headband to keep his one million points. Or people. He could not eat people in this round, or any of the other ones. He wasn\u2019t keen on using the snapping teeth to deter people either, since it left a big blindspot. Leaving Kacchan in a blindspot was a big no no.\u00a0\nThey survived that round by the skin of their teeth, all four of them moving onto the third round. It was 1v1, like\u00a0it was every year.\u00a0\nTodoroki pulled Izuku aside during lunch. He listened intently, and with a growing hate of Endeavor. When the boy had finished his story, Izuku growled to himself. Todoroki looked a bit taken aback at the sound.\u00a0Right, not everyone knew he was part cat.\u00a0\nIzuku looked up and stared down Todoroki. \u201cDo you want me to eat him?\u201d\n\u201cDo I...what?\u201d\n\u201cDo you. Want me. To. Eat him.\u201d\n\u201cNo? I...honestly don\u2019t know what you mean. At least I hope I don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cI can transport him to a different universe too. Or keep him in a pocket dimension until he learns his lesson. Or I can punch him through a wall, probably. Might break my arm, but it\u2019ll be worth it.\u201d\n\u201cUh, no thanks, Midoriya. I just wanted to tell you why I must beat you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not All Might\u2019s son, Todoroki,\u201d Izuku groaned, hiding his face in his hands. He looked back up a second later. \u201cIs there anything else you wanted to tell me?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cOk, come on then. You\u2019re eating lunch with us, and I will not take no for an answer.\u201d\nIzuku grabbed Todoroki\u2019s wrist and dragged him down the hallway. Right before they entered, he had an idea.\u00a0\n\u201cHey Todoroki, can I prank your dad?\u201d\n\u201cI...guess so. His security is tight though. Any human activity is monitored.\u201d\n\u201cHuman activity, you say?\u201d Izuku grinned mischievously. Oh how he was going to have fun this weekend.\nThe 1v1\u2019s came sooner than Izuku expected. He won against Shinsou, but only by getting help from the past users of One for All? He didn\u2019t exactly understand it. What he did understand was that Shinsou wanted to be a hero. And he was going to be a great one, he knew that for a fact.\u00a0\nHis match against Todoroki was next. Having been told he can\u2019t eat him, which would be counterproductive for what he wanted to do anyway, he would have to rely on One for All. Good thing he was completely willing to break a few bones to help his classmate.\u00a0\nThey stepped into the ring, and were off. Todoroki sent a wave of ice, and Izuku broke a finger. Rinse and repeat. Their dance continued until Todoroki started yelling at Izuku.\u00a0\n\u201cWhy are you trying to trying so hard to get me to use his fire! I told you why I never use it!\n\u201cIt\u2019s not his, Todoroki!\u201d Izuku screamed\u00a0back.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re doing nothing! You can\u2019t win this!\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t win this? Todoroki, you haven\u2019t put a scratch on me yet!\u201d\nTodoroki grumbled to himself, and sent another wave of ice. Izuku leapt over it, thankfully not breaking his legs.\u00a0\n\u201cWhy are you so willing to break yourself! I will never use his power, and nothing can change that!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s yours! Your Quirk, not his!\u201d\u00a0\nIzuku\u2019s scream made both freeze. It had come out tinged with something definitely not human. Hopefully the audience didn\u2019t catch that, he found himself thinking.\u00a0\nAnd then Todoroki caught fire. Izuku smiled in the new light.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you are, but you\u2019re crazy.\u201d\nIzuku never knew losing could feel so good.\nEmotionally, that is. His hand and arm were still broken, as Recovery Girl reminded him as soon as he walked into the halls. At least this time she didn\u2019t whack him with her cane. That thing hurt.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt was the weekend now. Saturday, to be specific. Izuku put the final item in his backpack and headed out.\u00a0\n\u201cBye, Mom! I\u2019ll be back later!\u201d\nShe reminded him to come back before it got dark, and he was off. A skip in his step as he walked down the sidewalk towards the train station. The ride would be a while, but completely worth it.\u00a0\nAfter all, Todoroki said humans were recognized in the security system. Cats, on the other hand...well, he could fit the pieces together just fine.\u00a0\nThe smile never left his face on the train. It would take an hour or so to get to Endeavor\u2019s main agency, so he used that time to plan things out. The cans of spray paint in his bag would be his\u00a0centerpiece.\u00a0\nOnce off the train, and hidden in an alleyway, he changed forms. Izuku was extremely grateful that his clothes changed with him instead of being left on the floor. The backpack didn\u2019t, but that didn\u2019t matter when he could just store it in a\u00a0pocket dimension.\u00a0\nNo one paid any attention to the alleycat wandering down the street. A few children pointed him out, since he was green and all. It wasn\u2019t uncommon for animals to be odd colors nowadays, so a green, curly-haired cat walking down the street wasn\u2019t too out of place.\u00a0\nThe front of Endeavor\u2019s agency was intimidating and flashy. There weren\u2019t many people going in or out right now. Izuku knew the hero himself wasn\u2019t there either, since he was out all day on the weekends. Which meant it was the perfect time to sneak in and cause some trouble.\nIzuku, as a cute little cat, trotted his way down the alley along the side of the agency. No one was down there thankfully, save for one person. And Izuku was in luck, because the person was taking out the trash for the agency. The door was left open because of it.\u00a0\nNo one noticed the green cat slip into the building. Izuku stuck to the wall, fur brushing it as he crept along on silent paws. Cameras were mounted on the walls, but he could stay in the blind spots since he was so small. There weren\u2019t many people that he could sense in the building too. Maybe a few sidekicks, but that was it.\u00a0\nA few turns later and Izuku was at Endeavor\u2019s personal office. Set in the front corner of the building and lined with windows. Izuku smirked, or at least as much as a cat could. There were no cameras in here.\u00a0\nHe transformed back into a person, and spat his bag onto the floor. The contents spilled out, but that was ok. Izuku checked to make sure everything was there anyway. Three cans of spray paint, two of silly-string, streamers, and the poster he had made and subsequently hidden from his mom.\u00a0\nFirst, Izuku took out the paint. He wasn\u2019t the best artist by any means, but he was decent. Good enough to paint a caricature of Endeavor with comically big eyebrows and a scowl to match. And to spray lines along his office walls that looked like confetti. It might have been a tad bit more destructive than what he would usually do, but he deserved it. Nedzu\u2019s personality might be\u00a0rubbing off on him a bit too much too.\u00a0\nNext, Izuku had fun with silly-string and streamers. By the time he was done it looked like an American high school party gone wrong, but without any alcohol. Before he put the poster up, Izuku turned back into a cat. Claws were a wonderful thing to use for furniture damage. In the next few minutes Izuku went haywire turning each and every chair, table, and especially the curtains into worn out pieces. Some might call it vintage and distressed, others would call it claw marks from an angry cat.\nWith that done, he taped the poster up (as a human). He surveyed the office proudly, especially the sign. It said \u201cCongratulations on being a horrible human being!\u201d with a smiley face at the end. Izuku made sure nothing he did could be traced back to him or Todoroki.\u00a0\nBefore turning back into a cat, Izuku unlocked the window and propped it open. Just enough to not set the alarm off, but enough for a cat to slip through. He swallowed the bag again too. With that he leapt onto the windowsill and out of the building. One advantage of being a cat was that he always landed on his feet, even if he was two stories up.\u00a0\nA green-haired boy walked out of the alley a cat had walked into, and not a single person batted an eye.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBonus:\nEndeavor was satisfied with his work today. Even if it did generate paperwork, as it always did. Might as well get it over with, he grumbled\u00a0as he walked to his office.\u00a0\nWhat he found was...a mess. His walls had neon stripes, his furniture and curtains were shredded, there was a ridiculous caricature of him behind his desk, and silly-string was everywhere. It also looked like everything on his desk had been swiped off, though most of it wasn\u2019t broken. Then he noticed the poster.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s safe to say his\u00a0whole office needed to be rebuilt after he quite literally burst into flames from anger.\u00a0\n\nIzuku knew he should have insisted Iida talk about his brother. He should have done something more to make sure he was ok. If he had, then maybe he wouldn\u2019t be racing over rooftops, desperately searching for his friend in the chaos that was currently Hosu.\u00a0\n\n\nThen he saw Iida, but his heart just sank further. The Hero Killer, Stain was standing above his friend. Another hero was there too, slumped against the wall behind Iida. Izuku leapt down, rebounded off an alley wall, and kicked Stain from behind.\u00a0\n\n\nThe Hero Killer stumbled off of Iida, leaping back once he had balance. Izuku hissed at Stain, standing over his friend protectively. No one touched his clan. Not without consequences.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAnother child,\u201d Stain grumbled.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cLeave him alone!\u201d Izuku snarled, his arms crackling with light.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou have good friends, Ingenium.\u201d Stain shifted his stance, and Izuku tensed. \u201cBut fake heroes must be culled.\u201d\n\n\nStain rushed forward faster than a human should be able to. Izuku took a single step back, but regained ground by punching his attacker. He reeled backwards, not expecting the force behind it.\u00a0\n\n\nBehind his back, Izuku sent out a distress signal. Hopefully another one of his classmates was in the area. That or they could at least tell a pro. He put his phone away, balling his fists in a guard.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s how it will be?\u201d Stain said. \u201cSo be it.\u201d\n\n\nIzuku made the first move before Stain could. He shot from where he was, lightning dancing over his body. Stain easily dodged. Too easily. He was too quick to be human.\u00a0\n\n\nThe realization hit Izuku just as a knife did. He lurched backwards, but not fast enough. Stain was on him in an instant, licking his cut.\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku collapsed like his strings had been cut. He tried to struggle, tried to move, anything. But he couldn\u2019t. Nothing worked. Not One for All or any of his other powers. He couldn\u2019t do anything to help.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cShame, you seemed to be one of the good ones,\u201d Stain mused. \u201cBut the fakes must die.\u201d\n\n\nStain raised his sword, poised over Iida. Izuku yelled, tears streaming down his face now.\u00a0\n\n\nThen a column of fire burned down the alley. Stain had to leap away from Iida and the hero to avoid it. Izuku sobbed in relief when he saw Todoroki standing there.\n\n\n\u201cBe more specific next time Midoriya, I was almost late.\u201d A sheet of ice drove Stain farther back, and allowed Todoroki to get to Izuku. \u201cAre you ok?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let him get your blood,\u201d Izuku warned almost frantically. \u201cHe\u2019s a vampire with a paralysis Quirk!\u201d\n\n\nTodoroki nodded, getting back to his feet, just as Stain dove for him from over the ice. Izuku tried to move again, and found himself able to twitch a finger.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWhy are you doing this?!\u201d Iida yelled, he was crying too. \u201cThis is my fight! I\u2019ve taken my brother\u2019s name, he\u2019s mine!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFunny,\u201d Todoroki called back, avoiding another sword swing. \u201cThe Ingenium I knew would never say something like that.\u201d\n\n\nA knife grazed Todoroki\u2019s cheek, just enough to draw blood. His left side flare before Stain could reach it. Another knife was thrown in the air, while Stain lunged forward at the same time with a sword. A trap. A dangerous one.\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku screamed, and found himself able to move once again. He grabbed Todoroki and pulled bot of them out of the way. The two retreating to Iida.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cPlease, don\u2019t spill any more blood for me,\u201d he cried. \u201cThis is \n\nmy fight\n\n!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIf you want us to stop, then stand up,\u201d Todoroki said, before sending more ice towards Stain.\u00a0\n\n\nA knife came flying out of nowhere and stabbed Todoroki\u2019s shoulder. Izuku watched as if it was in slow motion. His friend stumbled backwards, a hand coming up to the wound. Blood dripped down his arm, staining his costume. His eyes were wide.\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku...he felt something snap. He turned to look at Stain, everything felt slow. One for All ignited beneath his skin. He felt more than saw part of his other side emerge without conscious effort.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou hurt my clan,\u201d he whispered. Though it boomed down the alley like it had been screamed. Something inhuman and distorted laced each sound. \u201cYou made them bleed.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cClan?\u201d Stain questioned, coming to a stop for a mere moment.\n\n\nIt was all Izuku needed.\u00a0\n\n\nHe moved too fast for the eye to track. One moment he was next to Todoroki, the next he was in Stain\u2019s face. Expression twisted into a snarl and eyes alight in more ways than one. His mouth opened as if he was going to breath fire, but something very different came out.\n\n\nA cluster of teeth and tentacles surged towards Stain. The vampire managed to dodge, but just barely. Izuku did not stop. He dove forward again, and again. Stain wasn\u2019t infallible. He could make mistakes.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd he did. One simple slip. Quite literally, as he tripped on a piece of ice. All it took was a second.\n\n\nIzuku lashed out with his hands, tentacles retracting. Though he didn\u2019t punch like he usually did. No, he raked claws down the side of Stain\u2019s face. It didn\u2019t look like more than a glancing blow, certainly not something for such a strong villain.\n\n\nAnd yet, Stain backpedaled down the alley, one hand covering his face. The mask he wore fell down in shreds. Izuku didn\u2019t stop. He rushed forward again with a One for All powered punch straight to Stain\u2019s face. Iida rushed in, seeing the opportunity, and kicked Stain in the ribs. Izuku followed it up with a kick of his own. Todoroki made a ramp to let them get down safely.\u00a0\n\n\nNone of them moved, Stain included.\n\n\n\u201cIs it, is it over?\u201d Todoroki asked, breathing heavily.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s unconscious.\u201d Iida edged closer. Stain didn\u2019t move an inch, though Iida\u00a0noticed the five deep gashes that cut across his face.\n\n\n\u201cMidoriya, are you ok?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku vaguely knew he heard Todoroki, but he felt...detached. Like he wasn\u2019t in control right now. Sounds were muffled, smells were loud, and everything he saw was like he was underwater. His instincts were still screaming at him to protect his clan. To make sure his family was safe. To dispose of the threat for good.\u00a0\n\n\nA tap on his arm made him look up, but it didn\u2019t feel like it was fully him.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cMidoriya?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cClan. Safe?\u201d He chattered, sounding like a cat. Oh dear.\u00a0\n\n\nOh, that\u2019s what was happening. His mother had told him about this. If his clan, his family, was in danger, then he could revert to instincts. Not human instincts, that is. Which...was a problem.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYes, we\u2019re alright now, Midoriya,\u201d Iida answered.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cClan safe. Good.\u201d Izuku felt himself start to purr.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cMidoriya, how are you doing that? Are you ok?\u201d\n\n\nIzuku opened his mouth to answer, but suddenly the ground was a lot closer than it had been before. Not in the sense that he fainted. No, that would have been too kind a fate. Instead, he looked down and saw paws. His thoughts were no clearer than before.\n\n\nTodoroki and Iida sort of just, stared at him. Their mouths open as he trotted up to them. Todoroki let out a strangled noise as Izuku rubbed his cheek against Todoroki\u2019s left leg.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s...a cat,\u201d Todoroki stated.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cBakugou did say something about him being a cat morph. Perhaps\u00a0us being in danger brought it out?\u201d Iida suggested, leaning down to scoop up the purring green kitty. Izuku made no protest. The contact was helping him think at the very least.\n\n\nIt was then that the police and heroes showed up. Stain was tied up, and all weapons removed. The two boys were questioned, which included why they had a cat. The explanation seemed to satisfy the officers.\u00a0\n\n\nThe three were taken to a hospital and checked for injuries. A very much still a cat Izuku watched the nurses carefully as they checked over his friends. He still couldn\u2019t transform back. Probably wouldn\u2019t for another hour or two when he finally calmed down.\u00a0\n\n\nFor the time being, his friends were content with the purring green fluff-ball that curled up in their laps. Izuku would freak out when he finally transformed back into a person, but that was a problem for future Izuku.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIzuku knew this camp wasn\u2019t going to be extremely fun when him and his class were yeeted off a cliff. He did get to meet the Pussycats though! That was fun. The next day was very much not fun. At least Aizawa-Sensei took his aversion to sharing his other abilities to heart and let him practice in the trees. He did have to fight Tiger though. Once again, not very fun.\u00a0\n\n\nThe test of courage \n\nsounded\n\n fun, in theory at least. They get to try not to scream at 1-B, and then hide in the forest to try to make 1-B scream. Izuku thought Kacchan looked a bit too excited at the prospect of scaring the pants off people. Knowing him, he might take it literally.\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku was just happy he didn\u2019t get a bad partner. Then again, he didn\u2019t get one to begin with. Sero had gotten teamed up with Ashido and Kaminari, and all three of them had failed the final. Honestly not too much of a surprise since they were teamed up against \n\nNedzu\n\n. Izuku\u2019s mentor wasn\u2019t an easy opponent to beat, even if he was going easy on them.\u00a0\n\n\nThen he smelled smoke, and saw the fire a second later. Azure flames that ate away at the forest. Swirling clouds of dark gas rose from somewhere too, blanketing the trees and path.\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku physically stumbled when Mandalay said she didn\u2019t know where Kouta was. Right. His secret hideout. The one up on a cliff that only Izuku knew about.\u00a0\n\n\nHe hardly stayed long enough to tell a teacher where he was going. Green sparked off his body as he pushed his limit. He need to go faster. Needed to protect Kouta. Needed to \n\nprotect the lonely kit\n\n.\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku saw the looming figure, and the child at his feet, and dove without regard for himself. He scooped up Kouta in his arms and jumped away. A fist bigger than his arm slammed into the ground not a second behind the two.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cOh ho ho. Seems like I have another challenger!\u201d\n\n\nIzuku dared to look up, Kouta clutched to his chest. He took a few steps back, because in front of him was an Oni. It was missing an eye, and his horn only a stump near his hairline. This one must have been half human, Izuku noted, since his skin was the same color as one. The Oni also seemed to have some sort of magic, since he could see the muscles physically escaping his skin.\u00a0\n\n\nThis particular Oni was one Izuku knew too. Recognized, at least. Muscular, a villain known for his psychopathic nature. An S-ranked villain, the most dangerous rank. And he was here at his summer camp. Probably with the league.\u00a0\n\n\nMuscular was also the one to kill the Water Hose duo. Kouta\u2019s parents.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cOh I know you!\u201d He shouted, he sounded happy. \u201cYou\u2019re on our list, like that Bakugou kid! So I can\u2019t kill ya, but Bossman never said you had to be conscious.\u201d\n\n\nIzuku muttered possible plans under his breath. Kouta was clinging to his shirt like a lifeline. Muscular was smiling like a lunatic, which he was, and saying something about showing him blood. Izuku\u2026really didn\u2019t see an easy way out of this.\u00a0\n\n\nMuscular darted forward with more speed than Izuku thought was possible. He swung a fist, backed up by more muscle than his arm could contain. Izuku took Kouta and lunged out of the way, towards the trees. Maybe Muscular wouldn\u2019t be able to navigate as well in the dense forest.\n\n\nHe was proven wrong when Muscular just yelled and mowed down the trees like a rampaging elephant. If he could just avoid him for long enough. If he could just get to camp, then the pros could handle it.\u00a0\n\n\nThey wouldn\u2019t make it. He realized that in the split second before Muscular\u2019s fist collided with his side. Izuku went flying, curling protectively around Kouta. He was the priority. He had to keep Kouta safe.\u00a0\n\n\nBut he couldn\u2019t fight Muscular using One for All. At the percentage he could use now, it was essentially a weaker version of Muscular\u2019s own Quirk. Unless he wanted to risk breaking his arms so bad he couldn\u2019t ever use them again. Which he was, but right now it would do more harm than good.\n\n\nWhich left one option. Not one Izuku was particularly happy about, but\u2026it would keep Kouta and his classmates safe. If it would protect them, he\u2019d be willing to do almost anything.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cKouta,\u201d he said, loud enough for the kid to hear, \u201cI need you to close your eyes. Don\u2019t open them until I say so, ok? I\u2019m going to set you down in a bush, so you need to stay quiet.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cO-ok.\u201d\n\n\nIzuku checked that Kouta\u2019s eyes were closed, then hid him in the greenery. Satisfied the kid would be alright, he dashed farther from the hiding spot before stopping. Muscular was there in an instant. He stopped a few feet from Izuku.\n\n\n\u201cYou finally standin\u2019 and fighting then?\u201d He crowed, smiling more. \u201cThen come at me!\u201d\n\n\nIzuku swayed at the thought of what he was about to do. Quietly, he said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFor what, kid?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cFor breaking a promise I made.\u201d\n\n\nIzuku took a deep breath, and opened his mouth.\u00a0\n\n\nThe teeth and jaws were familiar to him. Not to Muscular obviously. The insane villain hesitated, and it was all the time Izuku needed.\u00a0\n\n\nHe felt the crunching of bones and the taste of blood. He felt whatever he bit off being dragged to different places, different pockets of space and time. His eyes were closed. Izuku didn\u2019t want to see what he had done. He felt the blood splatter on his legs anyway.\u00a0\n\n\nHe retracted his jaws and tentacles, feeling more blood smear over his mouth. A thump told him the other half was down now too. Izuku didn\u2019t look, and went to find Kouta.\u00a0\n\n\nAizawa-sensei found them on their way back. The two must have been quite the sight. One crying little kid and a teenager looking like he\u2019d gotten splashed by something darker than water. Izuku knew he couldn\u2019t get sick from what he\u2019d just done, not fever kind of sick at least, but he did feel like he wanted to puke up everything in his stomach.\u00a0\n\n\nHe handed off Kouta, and went off to find Kacchan. He was in danger. He had to protect him.\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku sat on his hospital bed. His stomach had long been settled, though his nerves were not. The teachers had discovered what remained of Muscular while he was unconscious. They didn\u2019t blame him, but he knew the looks Vlad-sensei gave him. It was why he avoided using his powers. Why he jumped at the chance to have One for All and not be associated with what his ancestors had done.\u00a0\n\n\nHis class didn\u2019t know. They all visited him. Kirishima told him their plan for rescuing Kacchan. Izuku agreed almost instantly. Anything to get his old friend back. Even if Kacchan had long since left him, Izuku still wanted him safe.\u00a0\n\n\nThey left that night, sneaking along in disguises in Kamino Ward. The tracker lead to a warehouse of Nomu.\n\n\nThen the building caved in. All at once it was obliterated, as well as the heroes that had broken in in the first place. A single man, if he could even be called that, strode out into the open.\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku instincts were \n\nscreaming\n\n. Repeating \n\ndanger, danger, danger to clan, chase away, kill, dangerous\n\n over and over in a mental mantra. It made his head hurt.\u00a0\n\n\nThe villains, and Kacchan, appeared not a minute later. All of them emerging from some sort of gray goo. Izuku went to leap up, to help Kacchan and get him away, but a hand stopped him. Iida was holding onto his sleeve, pinning Todoroki where he about to move alongside him. A glance to the side showed him Yaoyorozu was clinging to Kirishima\u2019s arm to stop him from running out too.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201c\n\nWe said no fighting\n\n,\u201d Iida hissed quietly.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cBut Kacchan\u2019s right there,\u201d Izuku growled. \u201cWe have to save him!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI will not allow you to become a vigilante, Midoriya!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThen help me find a way to get him out!\u201d\n\n\nSilently, Todoroki held up his right hand and made an ice cube. Izuku nodded, and waited for the pieces to snap into place for the others.\u00a0\n\n\nBefore Izuku knew what was happening, he was flying up an ice ramp with Iida and Kirishima. He risked looking down, and saw Kacchan shooting himself in the air. He was alright. He was safe. All Might didn\u2019t have to hold back now.\u00a0\n\n\nThey landed not too far from the ruined buildings. Todoroki and Yaoyorozu had promised to meet them at the train station. Kacchan was set down, though he didn\u2019t let go of Kirishima\u2019s hand. None of them commented on it.\u00a0\n\n\nThe four of them cautiously made their way to more populated streets. No villains tried to stop them thankfully.\u00a0\n\n\nHis clan was safe. Kacchan was with them now. Izuku finally let himself relax for the first time since the training camp.\n\n\n\n\n\nHitoshi Shinsou was finally moved to the hero course following the events of Kamino Ward. He was ecstatic. The hero course! It was his dream, and had been since he was a little kid.\u00a0\nThat being said, his new classmates were\u2026a bit odd. He knew most of them, but not their Quirks. Some were obvious, like the dude with a tail and the invisible fae girl. Others were definitely not, like the person that kept flirting with him. Even if he literally sparked when Hitoshi snarked (read: flirted) back.\u00a0\nThen there was Midoriya. Hitoshi had a decent opinion of the kid. They had fought in the sports festival, and Midoriya had shifted his world view by telling him that his power was so dangerous when he first tried to use it that one part had broken his limbs and the other had almost eaten someone. He was also still nice to Hitoshi after learning his Quirk, so Midoriya was automatically bumped up on his list of \u2018people he hated the least.\u2019\u00a0\nMoving into the dorms was\u2026fun. Well, the moving itself was alright, but living with nineteen other teenagers proved to be more chaotic than Hitoshi had originally been prepared for. The number of times he had witnessed something weird in this dorm, in the one week they had been living there, was already in the double digits. He usually just ignored it or walked out of the room.\nCurrently, it was maybe one am. Way past curfew, but Hitoshi didn\u2019t really care. He was awake and thirsty, so he went down to the kitchen. Aizawa-sensei wouldn\u2019t do more than warn him off of doing it again anyway.\u00a0\nIt was pitch black in the hallway though. Curfew meant literally all the lights went off, save for the ones inside rooms. Hitoshi improvised and used his phone flashlight so he didn\u2019t trip over anything.\u00a0\nHe was mindlessly playing on his phone, checking for things on the floor every few seconds, when he heard a noise. It made him look up, and Hitoshi immediately tripped. The crash caused whatever had made the noise look over at him. He promptly covered his mouth to muffle his shrieking. Because there was\u2026something, standing in the kitchen. It was looking at him with glowing yellow eyes.\u00a0\nFor a moment Hitoshi was outright convinced Mothman had broken into their dorm kitchens.\u00a0\nThe thing, obviously startled too, yelled and stumbled back a step. Except that when they opened their mouth, tentacles came out. Ones that had teeth on them. Hitoshi pointed his flashlight at whatever it was in his panic.\u00a0\nWhat he saw was a wide-eyed Midoriya staring at him with what looked like half an octopus coming out of his mouth. Hitoshi\u2019s mouth gaped open like a fish. The tentacles retracted, letting Midoriya start stuttering out incomprehensible phrases.\u00a0\n\u201cNo way,\u201d Hitoshi breathed. He knew he had stars in his eyes and an awed expression. \u201cYou\u2019re a Flerken.\u201d\u00a0\nMidoriya was now moved onto his \u2018people he actually liked\u2019 list. Currently only occupied by Eraserhead, Present Mic, and now Midoriya.\u00a0\n\u201cUm, y-you know wh-what those are?\u201d\n\u201cOf course I do! I, uh, I went through a phase of obsessing over different magics, especially creatures. Sorta never got over Flerkens and how cool they were.\u201d Hitoshi paused for a moment. \u201cWait, does that mean you can turn into a cat?!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not\u2026scared?\u201d\nHitoshi leveled a deadpan look at Midoriya. \u201cI\u2019m a Siren, Midoriya. I\u2019m the last person that would be scared of you.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Hitoshi couldn\u2019t be sure, but he thought Midoriya was blushing. \u201cT-to answer your qu-question, yes, I can t-turn into a cat.\u201d\n\u201cSo cool,\u201d Hitoshi whispered. An idea suddenly lit up light a lightbulb in his mind. \u201cHey, does the class know you can turn into a cat?\u201d\n\u201cY-yeah, Kacchan yelled about it on the first day. Only Iida and Todoroki know what I look like though. None of them\u2026none of them know I\u2019m a Flerken though.\u201d\n\u201cWh- how?\u201d\n\u201cNot a lot of people know what we are anyway.\u201d Midoriya shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t really care if they find out though.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d Hitoshi smirked, idly wondering if Midoriya could see in the dark. \u201cWant to help me pull a prank on them then?\u201d\nWhen Midoriya smiled, Hitoshi was suddenly reminded of why cats were predators.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHitoshi was either really early to class or borderline late. There was no in-between. So his classmates didn\u2019t exactly worry when they were all there before him. Aizawa-sensei wasn\u2019t supposed to come in for another few minutes anyway.\u00a0\nHowever, most of them were shocked when he walked in carrying a cat. A cute, fluffy little thing that had curly fur. It was dark green too, almost black. The class didn\u2019t move for all of thirty seconds before they descended on him like a flock of reporters.\u00a0\n\u201cAwww,\u201d Ashido cooed. \u201cHe\u2019s so cute! Where\u2019d you find him?\u201d\n\u201cCan we pet him?\u201d Hagakure squealed.\u00a0\n\u201cIs he yours?\u201d Uraraka asked.\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s not mine,\u201d was all Hitoshi said. The cat gave a small nod when Hitoshi glanced down at him. \u201cBut you can pet him.\u201d\nMost of the class almost instantly stroked the kitty. Hitoshi saw a few more of them coming up to see what was going on. He held back a laugh when he saw someone dragging Kouda over.\u00a0\n\u201cKouda! Kouda! Come talk to the cat! Ask what his name is!\u201d\nThe shy boy edged closer until he was finally near the cat. They blinked up at him. Kouda froze, which surprised a lot of them.\nThen he started signing wildly. Hitoshi, one of the only one to actually know sign in the class, got the general message.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat is it Kouda?\u201d Kirishima asked.\u00a0\n\u201cNot a cat,\u201d Kouda whispered, his voice laced with a bit of worry. \u201cNot a cat. Not a cat. Not a cat. Where did you find him Shinsou?\u201d\nIt was then that Todoroki walked up to see what the fuss was. He stopped for a moment, before scooping up the cat from Hitoshi arms. They didn\u2019t protest, so Hitoshi let him. Everyone else looked extremely jealous as the cat started purring in Todoroki\u2019s arms.\u00a0\nOne of the last to come over was Iida. He walked by, stopped for a moment, and pat the cat on the head. \u201cGood morning, Midoriya.\u201d\nThe rest of the class was in an instant uproar. Hitoshi was smiling like Aizawa-sensei when he revealed a logical ruse. Todoroki, Iida, and Bakugou seemed unaffected. Only Hitoshi knew why, and he loved it.\u00a0\n\u201cWait, wait, WAIT,\u201d Kaminari yelled over everyone else. \u201cDidn\u2019t Bakugou say something about him being a cat morph?\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah, he did, didn\u2019t he.\u201d\n\u201cWasn\u2019t it on the first day of school?\u201d\n\u201cAfter he threw the ball, right?\u201d\nHitoshi didn\u2019t say a thing, too busy trying not to laugh. Midoriya was watching everything from his perch on Todoroki. Everyone else was busy arguing over not remembering Midoriya was a cat morph.\nMidoriya meowed loudly, so Todoroki set him on his desk. The green cat then changed back into a green-haired teenager. Everyone stopped talking. Bakugou was cackling in the background.\u00a0\n\u201cHey everyone.\u201d\nThere were sixteen cries of \u201cMidoriya!\u201d that followed. He jolted from the sudden noise, but stayed where he was. Uraraka was the first one to ask him anything coherent.\n\u201cHow\u2019d you do that Deku?\u201d\n\u201cI, uh, remember when I, I told you and Iida my powers are complicated?\u201d She nodded, with the rest of the class was listening intently now. \u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019m a, a Flerken.\u201d\nHitoshi was proud of his friend for telling everyone. They all seemed to still be processing, when Bakugou stormed up and grabbed Midoriya\u2019s shirt collar, lifting him off the desk he was sitting on.\n\u201cWhat the FUCK is a Flicken,\u201d he growled.\n\u201cFlerken,\u201d Hitoshi corrected, tapping Bakugou\u2019s shoulder. \u201cAnd I would suggest putting him down before he eats you.\u201d\n\u201cThis useless cat can\u2019t do anything.\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah, isn\u2019t it that cat-thing that can hold pocket dimensions and universes in its mouth?\u201d Kaminari piped up.\u00a0\nBakugou dropped Midoriya on the ground. He slowly turned to stare at Kaminari, who looked about ready to use Kirishima as a shield. Midoriya picked himself up and brushed off his uniform.\n\u201cHe\u2019s right, Kacchan,\u201d he said, though softly.\nIt was silent, then Bakugou spoke again. \u201cYou\u2019re lying,\u201d he growled. \u201cYou\u2019re a lying cat that learned magic somehow. You\u2019re not powerful, you\u2019re not some mythical creature, you can\u2019t be because all you\u2019re useless ass can do is turn into a weak little cat.\u201d\nBakugou\u2019s palms glowed as he dove for Midoriya. Everyone moved forward, but it wasn\u2019t needed. Midoriya turned into a cat, effectively dodging the blast from Bakugou. The enraged dandelion then swung at the green, hissing cat.\u00a0\nNo one expected for a giant mouth and tentacles to make Bakugou disappear. The cat blinked, and leapt onto Midoriya\u2019s desk. Serenely licking a paw with a normal cat tongue. Everyone was staring at him, asking themselves if they had seen that correctly.\u00a0\nAizawa-sensei chose that moment to walk into class. Everyone scrambled for their seats, except for Midoriya. He stayed a cat sitting on his desk. Aizawa swept his gaze over the class. His eyes fell on Midoriya and the empty seat in front of him.\u00a0\n\u201cMidoriya, not again,\u201d he sighed heavily. \u201cI assume you told them this time?\u201d\nHe got a meow in answer. Aizawa pinched the bridge of his nose.\u00a0\n\u201cMidoriya spit Bakugou out right now.\u201d\nClass 1-A watched as the tiny cat spat a mostly dry Bakugou out onto the floor. Midoriya licked his paw again, though Hitoshi noticed he looked ready to run. Aizawa-sensei had one hand on his capture weapon.\n\u201cBakugou, sit down. Midoriya, please turn back into a human, cats can\u2019t take notes.\u201d\nBoth boys complied quickly. Bakugou looked, well, stunned was putting it mildly. He also looked slightly murderous, so there was that. Aizawa-sensei just looked done.\u00a0\n\u201cAny questions can be directed at Midoriya after class. Now then, today\u2019s heroics lesson is-\u201c\n\u00a0\nIzuku spent every period between classes trying to explain things to his class. Ranging from why Kacchan called him only a cat morph to explaining that, no Kaminari, he cannot send his homework to another dimension because he forgot to do it. He knew Shinsou was trying not to laugh at some of it, being the only one to know what a Flerken was apparently. It sure explained why Iida and Todoroki didn\u2019t figure it out after Hosu. \u00a0\nKacchan exploded for a minute, but cooled down eventually. Izuku had to explain that he had no control whatsoever over his powers in the beginning, which is why he never showed it. Seeing as he didn\u2019t want to actually eat someone on accident.\u00a0\nThe questions eventually trickled to a stop. Everyone was curious, that much was obvious, but\u2026they weren\u2019t mad. None of them were yelling or treating him different. No one accused him of being a villain or eating people for fun. It was\u2026nice, having them accept him. At least now he had an actual alibi for One for All.\u00a0\nClasses went on as normal, minus the chaos trio (Ashido, Kaminari, and Sero) asking if he could eat various things. \u201cFor science\u201d they claimed. The list included, but was definitely not limited to: Paper, pencils, two textbooks, Kacchan\u2019s extremely spicy curry (he ate that one like normal. The whole class amazing and slightly disturbed), a shirt, a tie, his backpack, and an entire desk. Everything but the curry was spit back up to where it belonged. Everyone asked if he could eat something at least once. Homework was off the list of things he would eat though.\u00a0\nAll in all, it wasn\u2019t a bad way for his class to find out what he was. They were his family now, his clan. And he wasn\u2019t about to let them go anytime soon.\n\u00a0\nBonus:\n\u201cHey Todoroki, Iida, he used his tentacles and things in Hosu, right?\u201d Jirou asked at lunch, maybe a week after he had revealed he was a Flerken. \u201cSo then, how come neither of you figured it out?\u201d\n\u201cAh, I did not know what a Flerken was,\u201d Iida answered. \u201cAnd I assumed it private, since Midoriya did not choose to share his powers with us.\u201d\nJirou nodded, accepting the answer. She turned to Todoroki next. Izuku went ahead and hid his head in his arms.\u00a0\n\u201cSoooo, Todoroki, why didn\u2019t you figure it out?\u201d\nThe split boy looked up passively, shrugging. \u201cI just thought it was a thing normal cats do.\u201d\nThe table was quiet. Ashido finally broke it when she said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I should be sad for you, or laugh. Why didn\u2019t you know what a normal cat was??\u201d\n\u201cMy father didn\u2019t want distractions for me.\u201d He shrugged again. \u201cI didn\u2019t get out much either, so I had never interacted with cats before.\u201d\n\u201cSo then, what\u2019s the verdict on cats?\u201d Jirou asked, waving a chopstick at him.\u00a0\n\u201cThey\u2019re nice, especially ones that tear up my father\u2019s office.\u201d\nIzuku squeaked, and curled into a tighter ball. Everyone else was looked at the two of them with raised eyebrows. Because how could the cute little kitty boy destroy anything that belonged to a hero? Surely not Izuku. Never. He loved heroes too much.\u00a0\nIzuku smirked as his class whispered. Perhaps it was time to remind them that cats had claws."
