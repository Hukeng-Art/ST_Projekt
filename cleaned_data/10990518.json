    "text": "They told the story late at night around a campfire. A harrowing tale, truly\u2014one of risk, action, reunion, and love. Everyone, even those who had witnessed the events firsthand, listened with rapt attention over cups of steaming tea. Ginseng. Zuko brewed and served it himself, to high praise from the ex-prisoners.\n\u201cMy uncle makes it better,\u201d he promised, and gave a small nod, \u201cbut thank you.\u201d He was almost certain he\u2019d forgotten a step or two. The Jasmine Dragon felt years removed from his memory.\nThe tea served, he took his place at the periphery. He was half shadow, sitting back just slightly from the others as he listened. After months as the center of attention, it was a welcome reprieve. He did not miss the spotlight of royalty, nor the hundreds of eyes\u2014belonging to servants, citizens, palanquin bearers, fathers\u2014that had studied his every move at the Palace. There were, it now seemed, some benefits to treason and disgrace; namely, that he could drop his guard, drink his tea, and listen to Chief Hakoda regale the group with the tale of their escape.\nThe water tribe warrior was a master storyteller. He wove in just enough suspense to keep his listeners hooked, incorporated just enough detail to paint a vivid picture of the scene. His voice rose and fell, the cadence perfectly matching the action he described. Zuko had to remind himself, every now and then, that he shouldn\u2019t be on the edge of his seat\u2014he knew Chit Sang hadn\u2019t identified Sokka as the imposter\u2014but he felt the suspense regardless. Hakoda was good. Very good.\n\u201cAnd then the gondola started moving, farther and farther from the platform,\u201d Sokka chimed in. \u201cBut Zuko wasn\u2019t on it. He was trying to break the lever so they couldn\u2019t stop us. It took a few tries, but he chopped it right in half.\u201d Sokka looked over at Zuko with a grin and made a huge swiping gesture with his hand. \u201cKapow!\u201d\nToph frowned, inclining her head toward Zuko. \u201cWait, how\u2019d you get on the gondola?\u201d\nZuko shrugged. \u201cI jumped.\u201d\n\u201cOh no,\u201d Sokka interjected, shaking his head. \u201cHe more than jumped. He leaped. I thought he wasn\u2019t going to make it. For a few seconds, I was sure he was going to fall into the boiling lake.\u00a0\n\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d Zuko added. Across the circle Katara snorted.\n\u201cReally? I never would have guessed.\u201d\nThey laughed, and he smiled along with them.\n\u201cThat was all on me,\u201d Sokka continued. \u201cHe was a few feet short, but I reached out and grabbed his arm mid-air. We make a good team.\u201d He grinned, and Zuko offered a smile in return.\nSokka seemed to have a similar gift as his father. Uncle Iroh possessed it as well\u2014the talent of storytelling. Zuko, on the other hand, would probably have described their trip to the Boiling Rock in the most bland, straightforward of ways. He was happy to just listen, and leave the storytelling to those with an ear for embellishment.\n\u201cWe\u2019re so glad to have you back, Dad.\u201d There was a gentleness in Katara\u2019s eyes that Zuko hadn\u2019t seen since Ba Sing Se.\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to be back. Although, it really has only been a few weeks.\u00a0\nAcross the fire, Aang frowned. \u201cStill, you were in prison. That must have been hard.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I was lucky you kids came along. We all were,\u201d the chief noted, looking at the other two still wearing the rough, red uniform. \u201cThe food wasn\u2019t so good, either. I\u2019ve really been missing Stewed Seaprunes.\u201d\n\u201cEugh.\u201d\nHakoda barked a laugh at Aang\u2019s disgust. \u201cThey\u2019re definitely an acquired taste.\u201d\n\u201cRemember that time Sokka got sick and was only allowed to drink seaprune juice for a whole week?\u201d\n\u201cUgh.\u201d Sokka grimaced at his sister\u2019s words. \u201cDon\u2019t remind me.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019d been out hunting for seaotter-lions, right, son? And you lost your parka somehow\u2026\u201d\nThe story of the icy tundra disappeared somewhere in Zuko\u2019s mind. He simply observed as they reminisced, the chief with the booming laugh flanked by Katara on his left and Sokka on his right. The fire swelled in front of them, lighting their faces as they smiled at memory. Zuko hardly noticed it becoming lighter, lighter, the flames climbing higher and swelling even larger.\u00a0\n\u201cUh, Zuko?\u201d\nHe blinked at Aang\u2019s voice, and saw the fire deflate. He had interrupted their story\u2014everyone was looking at him, now.\n\u201cOh. Sorry. I didn\u2019t even realize\u2026\u201d He felt the good side of his face grow red. Stupid. He hadn\u2019t been paying attention. He was better than that. Across the circle he caught Chief Hakoda studying him. Zuko stood and changed the subject. \u201cIs everyone done with their tea?\u201d\nHe collected the cups in a balancing act fit for Ty Lee\u2019s circus, taking them over to where the dishes and pots from their late dinner sat forgotten. He took a deep breath and turned back toward the fire, toward the circle of friends and allies and former enemies. Laughs bounced off the stone pillars of the temple\u2014Sokka must have cracked a joke. Zuko felt his mouth pull into a soft smile. A foreign expression for years, the motion had become familiar since arriving here.\nIt made little sense, logically. In the past two weeks, he had turned on everything he\u2019d once believed, been condemned as a traitor, and nearly killed twice by his only remaining immediate family. The fate of the world rested on his shoulders, and his destiny was upon him.\nAnd still, he felt as if his ragged edges had been sanded smooth. He smiled. Softly.\nHe sat down again not at the fire but at the temple\u2019s edge. His feet dangled over the precipice, daring gravity; his firebender\u2019s eyes, made for the white-hot light of flame, couldn\u2019t make out a thing despite how much they strained. Pitch-black opened beyond the ledge. He thought of Toph, then unwittingly of three-year-old panic that had eclipsed even the searing pain engulfing the left side of his face\u2026\n\u2026I can\u2019t\u2026Father! I can\u2019t see! Father?...Uncle? I can\u2019t\u2026\nHe shut his eyes against the memory. The bandages had come off, eventually, and the world had returned. But Father wasn\u2019t there, and what he saw beneath the gauze had made him wish\u2026\nTonight, though, he did not mind the darkness. It quieted the noise in his head. Soothed him.\n\u201cPrince Zuko?\u201d\nHe had not heard the footsteps approaching; that was twice in one night he\u2019d let his mind drift. Zuko stood and bowed the traditional Fire Nation greeting. \u201cChief Hakoda.\u201d\n\u201cPlease, just Hakoda. Mind if I sit?\u201d\n\u201cNot at all.\u201d\nHakoda took a seat at Zuko\u2019s left, folding his legs under him. \u201cI should thank you, Prince Zuko.\u201d\n\u201cIf you are just Hakoda, then I\u2019m just Zuko,\u201d the boy pointed out. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t have to thank me.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWell, Sokka told me that he\u2019d tried to go alone and that you\u2019d insisted on coming with him. So I really do have to thank you, because frankly I\u2019m not sure my son would have made it back without you.\u201d\nZuko smirked. \u201cCan\u2019t disagree with you there. He was going to try to take Appa.\u201d\n\u201cYou risked a lot to go with him. I appreciate it.\u201d\u00a0\nZuko waved it away with his hand. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to let him infiltrate a maximum security prison without backup. That\u2019s just stupid.\u201d\n\u201cStill, the punishment for treason is execution,\u201d Hakoda pointed out. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty gutsy to break into the most heavily guarded Fire Nation prison with a price just placed on your head.\u201d\nA shrug. \u201cI\u2019m pretty used to being unwelcome in my homeland.\u201d And to the bounty isn\u2019t exactly new either.\n\u201cYeah, I noticed that it wasn\u2019t exactly the warmest of homecomings,\u201d Hakoda admitted, scratching the back of his head. \u201cNo pun intended.\u201d Zuko almost laughed. Almost.\n\u201cMy sister isn\u2019t the warmest of people.\u201d\n\u201cBlue-fire-girl, right?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\nSomething peculiar crossed Hakoda\u2019s face, and Zuko fidgeted. \u201cWhat?\u201d\u00a0\nHakoda leaned back on his hands and uncrossed his legs, letting them dangle over the edge. The chasm yawned at their feet. \u201cShe just seemed awfully eager to watch us get boiled alive in that lake.\u201d\u00a0\nAs the father of two children with a sibling relationship that was actually functional, Zuko doubted the chief could understand why he\u2019d chuckled at the statement. To Hakoda, Azula\u2019s presumed final words to her brother would have seemed cold at best. Goodbye, Zuko.\u00a0\n\u201cAzula\u2019s wanted me out of the picture for a long time,\u201d Zuko dismissed.\n\u201cI see. Birthright?\u201d\nHe just shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s more complicated than that. Azula\u2026 she\u2019s got a lot of our father in her.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cAnd you?\u201d\u00a0\nZuko did not hesitate in his answer. \u201cI take after our mother.\u201d And her grandfather.\u00a0\n\u201cWhere is she n\u2014\u201d\n\u201cGone.\u201d Zuko\u2019s eyes searched the darkness. The other cliff-face was over there, somewhere. \u201cFor years now.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nZuko nodded, and remembered something. The cave had been lit by a soft green glow, and his own words had echoed\u2026\n\u2026that\u2019s something we have in common\u2026\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry about your wife.\u201d\nHakoda sighed wearily. \u201cThis war has taken something from everyone.\u201d He cast a sideways glance, and Zuko felt the chief\u2019s eyes tracing the outline of his scar\u2014where pale skin met wrinkled, leathery flesh.\u00a0\nHis ruined eye drifted shut. \u201cKatara and Sokka were lucky to have you\u2026 after.\u201d The words reached his ears and he hated how transparent they sounded.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t around very long after Kya died. All of the men left to fight in the war.\u201d Hakoda bowed his head. \u201cMy children\u2026 That was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever had to do. Six years, before I\u2019d see them again.\u201d\nZuko looked away, a phantom burning in the left side of his face.\n\u201cSokka did a good job protecting the village. You should be proud. He built a watchtower and everything.\u201d\nHakoda quirked an eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019ve been there?\u201d\n\u201cOnce.\u201d Zuko paused. \u201cWhen I was a different person.\u201d\nHakoda seemed to catch on. \u201cAh. When you were chasing Aang?\u201d\nOh, how even the memory of that blue-white beam of light still filled his stomach with vestigial hope and desperation. Three years of sickening obsession were not so easily left behind.\n\u201cI crashed my ship into the village.\u201d Shut up, came a cry from the corner of his mind, but Zuko didn\u2019t listen. He could not stop. \u201cI threatened them. Women and children. I bent fire.\u201d They were emotionless declarations. He looked to Hakoda to gauge his reaction, searching for the anger that had to be there somewhere, beneath that calm and forgiving demeanor. Zuko prodded one more time: \u201cI fought Sokka. I broke his spear in half.\u201d He looked again, out of the corner of his slotted eye. Where was the rage, the explosive fury at such wrongdoing? The other shoe had to drop.\nPerhaps Hakoda realized he was being tested, because he didn\u2019t take the bait. Instead, he quirked an eyebrow. \u201cSokka tried coming at a group of armored firebenders with a spear?\u201d\nTension drained from Zuko\u2019s shoulders, and he felt his rigid posture give a little. A small smile crept onto his face. \u201cHe actually managed to get the best of me, at one point.\u201d\n\u201cThe boomerang?\u201d\nZuko grimaced and rubbed the back of his head. Hakoda clapped him on the shoulder with a throaty laugh. The contact was unexpected, and Zuko stiffened. \u201cI\u2019ve been hit by accident a few times on hunting trips. Saw stars for hours afterwards. Sokka\u2019s gotten a lot better since those days, though\u2014wish I could take credit for it.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t teach him?\u201d\n\u201cNope, he taught himself to use that thing. It took him forever and got a lot of bumps on his head, but he\u2019s nothing if not persistent.\u201d\nZuko pursed his lips. \u201cUncle Iroh always said the same about me, but I\u2019m not sure it was a good thing.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s gotten you this far, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d\nThere are four characters inscribed on a pearl blade and engraved in his mind. \u201cThere were some things I should have given up on a long time ago. But I was too stubborn to see the truth.\u201d What could he have saved, if he hadn\u2019t been so blinded by determination? Time, heartache? Lives? He\u2019d been consumed for three years, entirely.\nMost of that time blurred together. There were deeds, fuelled by grief and desperation, that he could not even remember. When Suki had said he\u2019d burnt down her village, he\u2019d had to stop himself from asking and which one was that?\nIn those three years, he\u2019d disobeyed his mother\u2019s final command.\nHakoda was silent for a moment, but never looked away from the young man before him. His gaze was heavy and thoughtful.\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent a lot of time at sea in the past six years. You know how it is, one port to the next, not much to break the boredom.\u201d\nZuko responded with a curt nod, and waited for the chief to go on.\n\u201cAnd you know how sailors love scuttlebutt. Rumors flew around at every port we ever went to.\u201d\n\u201cThat was mainly how I tracked Aang.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s an efficient network, as long as you don\u2019t take everything at face value. Rumors are still rumors. And I heard a lot of stories over the years.\u201d Something in his demeanor shifted. Zuko stiffened. \u201cBut there was one, a few years after we left the South, that I still think about.\u201d\nZuko swallowed, eyes fixed on the darkness in front of him. \u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cMhmm. We were docked in some seedy Earth Kingdom port, waiting for a storm to pass. A merchant had come to trade with us. Talking passed the time.\u201d Hakoda paused for a moment. \u201cHe asked if we\u2019d heard the news. About the Fire Nation prince.\u201d\nZuko\u2019s face froze. He stared straight ahead as the water tribe chief continued.\n\u201cHe was thirteen, according to the merchant. Sokka\u2019s age. I was\u2026 fascinated.\u201d\nFascinated. Zuko had grown accustomed to this reaction. He\u2019d seen morbid curiosity shining in the eyes of onlookers\u2014who didn\u2019t know the first thing\u2014for years now. His life was a curious exhibition and few could bring themselves to look away.\n\u201cThe merchant said that the boy had been exiled and sent to complete an impossible mission. He\u2019d disrespected one of his father\u2019s generals and been ordered to fight a fire duel.\u201d Hakoda shook his head. \u201cBut I guess it wasn\u2019t the general\u00a0he had to fight.\u201d\nThree-year-old horror settled in Zuko\u2019s gut. He did not want to hear this, but he made no move to stop the chief. His throat had sealed shut, and he could only stare forward into the black. Hakoda\u2019s weighted words hung in the air for a moment before dropping like stones into the void.\n\u201cThe boy prostrated himself before his father and pledged his loyalty. He refused to fight.\u201d\nZuko\u2019s knees ached from where he\u2019d fallen, hard, on the cold white stones. He remembered just how the desperate pleas had tasted on his tongue\u2014like salt water and bubbling, acrid horror. He had never felt so small.\n\u201cThen the Firelord decreed that the boy would suffer. He reached out a hand as if to wipe away the tears\u2026\u201d\nOh, a great storyteller indeed. Zuko waited for the blow.\n\u201cAnd he lit his child\u2019s face on fire.\u201d\nSomething strangled rose from Zuko\u2019s throat as Hakoda\u2019s words tore through him like his father\u2019s damning flames. He sucked in a breath and found that his lips were once again damp with salt water. He tasted burning flesh.\nZuko knew the story better than anyone. That scene had replayed through his mind on a torturous loop for three years\u2014but always from his own perspective. Never before had he heard the story from someone else\u2019s mouth. Was this what his uncle had seen that day? His sister? The general he\u2019d insulted?\nIt was devastating; even more so, to think that this boy curled up around his agony\u2014whose screams had long since grown hoarse and whose young body was a spectacle of seeping crimson upon cold, white tiles\u2014would spend the next three years fighting for nothing more than the love of the man who\u2019d done this to him. The air filled with foul, flesh-burning smoke and Zuko wanted to go to the writhing form, to force open the bubbling, mutilated eye and make it see everything that had recently become so obvious. So painfully obvious.\nHis own voice echoed off the walls of the bunker. It was cruel, and it was wrong!\nHakoda was looking at his scar. He was looking straight through it. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe him.\u201d\nZuko looked up. \u201cWhat?\u201d His voice was hoarse from the child\u2019s screaming.\n\u201cThe merchant. Sailors love to exaggerate and spin tales. I refused to believe it.\u201d Hakoda heaved a weighty sigh. \u201cBut then Sokka told me you were there, at the Boiling Rock. He said you were on our side. And then I saw you. I saw the scar. And I\u2026\u201d\nHakoda was a brave man, Zuko decided, to be speaking of such things. Very few had ever acknowledged his disfigurement outright\u2014the work of pity, he knew. But Sokka\u2019s father spoke freely of the taboo, and Zuko wasn\u2019t sure if he was relieved or affronted.\nThere was a peculiar weariness in the older man\u2019s face that Zuko had seen many times on his uncle\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019d refused to believe it\u2026 but it was all true, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Hakoda looked to the prince for confirmation. Zuko couldn\u2019t bring himself to nod, and that was answer enough.\n\u201cYou were just a kid.\u201d Sokka\u2019s age, Zuko heard.\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\u201cYour father didn\u2019t deserve your loyalty. And you didn\u2019t deserve what he did to you.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d Zuko ran a hand through his long, unkempt hair, over his mangled stub of an ear. \u201cI told him as much. When I left.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he took that well.\u201d So, sarcasm ran in the family. Zuko\u2019s mouth turned upward in morbid amusement.\n\u201cHe shot me full of lightning.\u201d Zuko looked down at his fingertips, and with the soft light from the campfire behind them could make out the fading patches of black from where the bolt had entered and exited his body. Sometimes when he lay in bed at night, he could still feel residual tingles and jolts that lay dormant in his chi.\nHakoda quirked an eyebrow. \u201cAnd you\u2019re still here? When that happened to Aang he\u2026 well, died.\u201d\nZuko was still looking at his fingertips. \u201cMy uncle taught me how to redirect the lightning. Between my sister and father, I guess he knew I\u2019d need it.\u201d Zuko had been so eager that day on the hilltop to practice with real lightning. He\u2019d been ready. He\u2019d needed practice, and Iroh refused\u2026\n\u2026What, are you crazy?! I\u2019m not going to shoot lightning at you!\nOzai would have, Zuko had thought then\u2014and Ozai did. Shame and regret filled his stomach, and he tasted sick on the back of his throat. Ginseng tea and residual, metallic electricity. So many mistakes.\n\u201cRedirect lightning? I\u2019ve never heard of that before.\u201d\n\u201cUncle invented it, by studying waterbenders.\u201d How ridiculous the notion had seemed initially, to his closed mind. Zuko now knew it was nothing short of genius.\n\u201cYour uncle, is he still\u2026?\u201d Hakoda treaded lightly. He must have known he\u2019d left the prince raw.\nZuko blinked. \u201cI made a mistake, in Ba Sing Se, and Uncle paid the price. Ask Katara, she\u2019ll tell you all about it.\u201d Chest-crushing guilt masquerading as bitterness. \u201cBut he\u2019s alive. He escaped from prison during the eclipse.\u201d\nThere was a hand on Zuko\u2019s shoulder and once he resisted the urge to pull away, it was actually quite comforting. \u201cYour uncle will forgive you.\u201d\nThe uncertainty ate Zuko\u2019s words and stifled him silent. He could not bear the other possibility. Hakoda waited him out.\n\u201cMy uncle travelled with me for three years. And I was not the\u2026 easiest person to deal with, then.\u201d Angry jerk with a ponytail, Toph had quoted Sokka. \u201cHe was the true father to me, and I didn\u2019t appreciate him. The whole time, he knew the truth about my banishment, but he couldn\u2019t tell me because I wouldn\u2019t listen. He just\u2026\u201d Zuko shook his head, baffled. \u201cSupported me. And tried to guide me in the right direction.\u201d\nHakoda\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cThe truth of your banishment?\u201d\nZuko shoulders were heavy. \u201cThat my father never intended for me to capture the Avatar. That he favored Azula as his heir and had been looking for an excuse since mom\u2014\u201d He stopped himself, composed himself, breathed. \u201cHe was looking for a reason, and speaking out of turn was as good as any.\u201d\nHakoda raised an eyebrow in disbelief. \u201cThat was all you did? Speak out of turn?\u201d\nZuko shrugged. \u201cI was foolish and brash. Inexperienced in politics.\u201d\n\u201cYou were a child.\u201d\n\u201cYou keep saying that,\u201d Zuko noted pointedly.\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s true!\u201d Hakoda shook his head, and spoke to himself, \u201cThe fate of the world rests on the shoulders of children.\u201d\nZuko gritted his teeth. \u201cWe are more than capable\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBelieve me,\u201d the chief chuckled humorlessly, \u201cI know. I\u2019m only saddened. It\u2019s a great burden to bear. And you\u2019ve had to bear one heavier than most.\u201d\nSomething flared within the prince. \u201cI don\u2019t want your pity.\u201d\n\u201cNot pity,\u201d Hakoda corrected, turning his whole body to face the boy. \u201cRespect.\u201d\nZuko\u2019s shoulders deflated and both eyes, good and bad, widened slightly. Doubt burned gold in his irises and he stole a glance behind them, across the temple to the group still gathered around the fire. Hakoda seemed to understand.\n\u201cYour mistakes are in the past. You\u2019re righting them, now.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to,\u201d Zuko agreed. \u201cBut there\u2019s\u2026 a lot.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019ve already welcomed you into their group,\u201d Hakoda pointed out. \u201cThey know that you only did all those things because you wanted to go home.\u201d\nZuko paused. Oh. His eyes fell to the side. He couldn\u2019t see Hakoda, but he could feel the pointed, almost disbelieving stare.\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t told them?\u201d\nHis answer was quick. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t come up.\u201d\n\u201cNot even when you were trying to explain why you were suddenly on their side?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to seem like I was making excuses for my actions. And I didn\u2019t want pity.\u201d\nHakoda hummed. \u201cYou are a proud man, Prince Zuko.\u201d\nOne good eyebrow slanted downward, the younger looked up at the older. The chief was certainly not the first to accuse him of that. Usually, that word had come with others\u2014arrogant, selfish, spoiled. But that was then.\nHakoda held up his hand. \u201cI don\u2019t mean that in a bad way. I meant that you are\u2026 dignified. Noble.\u201d\nHonorable, he might have said.\nZuko\u2019s face softened, but still the fact remained: \u201cThey didn\u2019t need to know.\u201d Sure, joining the group probably would have gone a lot more smoothly if he\u2019d whipped out his sob story, but he\u2019d managed without it. Barely.\n\u201cEven after all those months of chasing and attacking them?\u201d\nZuko\u2019s gut twisted. He bristled. \u201cWhat, so I owe it to them?\u201d His hands made fists at his side.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Hakoda asserted, and Zuko relaxed. \u201cA man\u2019s past is his own business.\u201d\n\u201cThen\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cThere are other reasons to do things besides necessity or obligation.\u201d\nZuko absorbed this, methodically. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d\nThe chief studied him. \u201cI\u2019m sure you know by now that when you came here, you weren\u2019t just signing on as Aang\u2019s firebending teacher. From what I can tell, there\u2019s a lot more that goes with being a part of their group.\"\n\u201cThey\u2019re really close,\u201d Zuko agreed. He\u2019d ridiculed them for that, when he was chasing them. Always letting their emotions interfere. Weakness, his father would have said.\nZuko knew now it was their greatest strength.\n\u201cMy son is a warrior,\u201d Hakoda began, \u201cand in the watertribe, we warriors are like brothers. We trust that the other will follow our lead. We trust that the other will fight bravely. And we look out for one another.\u201d A knowing smile plays at the chief\u2019s mouth. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I saw you two doing at the Boiling Rock. To Sokka, you\u2019re a fellow warrior now.\u201d He let that settle, then added, \u201cA brother.\"\nZuko felt that soft smile on his lips again.\n\u201cAnd Aang,\u201d Hakoda continued, \u201cWell you\u2019ve heard him talk about all the friends he had from all over the world, before the war.\u201d A word drifted to Zuko from months ago, unconsciousness lingering around the edges of the name Kuzon\u2026\n\nDo you think we could have been friends, too?\n\n\u201cZuko, you\u2019re not just Aang\u2019s teacher, but a friend\u2014and from what Katara\u2019s told me, since the kid never had a family, he takes friendship very seriously. Look at how he\u2019s stuck by my children.\u201d Hakoda glanced back at the group around the fire. The group sat laughing. \u201cNow, the earthbender\u2026 I don\u2019t know her very well. But it seems to me that she\u2019s found in you a partner in crime.\u201d\nHakoda\u2019s argument had begun to take shape, but there was one piece quite notably missing.\n\u201cAnd Katara?\u201d It was a vulnerable question, Zuko knew. Doubt colored her name.\nHakoda gave a wry smile. \u201cShe\u2019s been giving you a hard time, huh?\u201d\n\u201cShe still blames me.\u201d\n\u201cZuko, my daughter is\u2026\u201d A heavy sigh. \u201cWhen we lost Kya, Katara stepped up. She\u2019s fiercely protective of her family, and this\u2026\u201d he gestured around them, \u201cis her family. Not just Sokka, but Aang and Toph, too. Up until recently, you\u2019ve always been a threat to that. She doesn\u2019t take that lightly.\u201d\nIn the darkness before them, the prince saw light rippling off a pond. That\u2019s what mothers are like, Zuko\u2026\n\u201cI was with Katara for quite a while after Ba Sing Se,\u201d Hakoda continued. \u201cI watched her heal Aang. It was a\u2026 tense time. This war has taken its toll on everyone.\u201d\n\n\u2026every time I pictured the face of the enemy\u2026\n\nZuko\u2019s blackened fingertips drifted to his disfigured eye. \u201cShe needed someone to blame. I understand.\u201d\nThere was a hand on his arm, suddenly. Calloused and firm and sympathetic. Hakoda moved Zuko\u2019s hand away from the scar\u2014he wanted the boy to look at him. \u201cMy daughter is protective and she can certainly hold a grudge,\u201d Hakoda guaranteed, \u201cbut she is also a healer at heart; she helps those who need her. And she always wants to believe the best in people, although the war\u2019s made her a bit more like Sokka.\u201d The father gave a light chuckle. \u201cShe\u2019ll forgive you, in time. But even until then, you are still a part of her family. She, and all of them, care about you.\u201d Hakoda\u2019s eyes were bright blue even in the low light\u2014like water, calm and reassuring. \u201cThey would want to understand.\u201d\nZuko didn\u2019t know how to tell the chief that he couldn\u2019t tell that story\u2014that in the three years he\u2019d carried this mark, he\u2019d never once found the words to describe that day in the arena. He\u2019d never had to. It was his story to keep locked inside.\nBut there were words, he knew. There were always words, but he would not speak them.\n\nI begged for mercy and he was my father and I wouldn\u2019t do it and he branded me like a\u2014\n\nZuko was years older and wiser, now. He understood all of what the boy shaking at his father\u2019s feet could not. But even now, that boy was still inside him, tearing at bandages that blocked the world and crying, Father, is that you?\nHe\u2019d only just heard the story told for the first time tonight. He wasn\u2019t ready yet to hear it from his own mouth.\n\u201cI\u2019m not a very good storyteller,\u201d he told Hakoda instead.\nThe chief waved a hand dismissively. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be. What happened that day shaped you into the man you are now\u2014one way or another, they would just want to know. They\u2019re your family now. They care.\"\nPrivately, Zuko made his decision. After the war, he vowed, after the world is saved. He realized (as that soft smile found a home on his lips once again) that he wanted them to know. Understanding was an enticing offer.\n\u201cYou remind me of my uncle, Chief Hakoda. He always knew what to say.\u201d\nA grin. \u201cI\u2019ll take that as a compliment. I\u2019d like to meet this Uncle Iroh of yours, once this whole mess is over.\u201d\n\u201cHopefully he\u2019ll be Firelord Iroh by then,\u201d Zuko mused.\nA frown touched Hakoda\u2019s lips. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to take the throne?\u201d\n\u201cMy uncle is the rightful heir.\u201d If Lu Ten hadn\u2019t died and Ozai hadn\u2019t suggested and Azulon hadn\u2019t ordered and Ursa hadn\u2019t loved her son enough to\u2026\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be Firelord?\u201d\nSomehow, Hakoda knew just how to cut right to the heart of Zuko\u2019s inner struggle. Maybe it was a father\u2019s skill\u2014Ozai had known, too, but he\u2019d wielded that knowledge as a weapon. Where Zuko\u2019s father had sought to tear him apart, Hakoda sought to mend.\nMaybe that was why the chief reminded Zuko of his uncle.\nZuko looked down at his hands. There was warmth in his fingertips, seeking a way out. He allowed a small flame to dance in the open air and stared, entranced, at its movement. \u201cI try not to think about it.\u201d\n\u201cBecause you don\u2019t think you\u2019re ready?\u201d The little flame cast light on Hakoda\u2019s curious expression.\nZuko closed his fist around the fire. \u201cBecause it\u2019s a distraction. Right now I need to focus on training Aang so he has at least a chance at ending the war. What happens afterward\u2026\u201d He shook his head. \u201cWe\u2019ll worry about that once my father\u2019s dead.\u201d\nPerhaps Hakoda was surprised by this\u2014that would explain the sharp intake of breath that the chief couldn\u2019t quite hide. Perhaps he was horrified that a son could speak so callously of his father\u2019s death, no matter past abuse. Perhaps, when he caught Zuko\u2019s shoulder and turned square to face him, Hakoda was expecting bloodlust in the boy\u2019s eyes.\nPerhaps he was relieved to find sadness instead.\nZuko shuddered and pulled away. It was easier to face the pitch-black void than Hakoda\u2019s searching, liquid gaze.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want him to die.\u201d\nThe prince\u2019s heart sent up a shield of flames. \u201cHe deserves it.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you deserve a father that wouldn\u2019t sear half your face off. That\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d\nWere all men of the Water Tribe this blunt?\n\u201cHe needs to be stopped. This is the only way.\u201d\n\u201cBut if it were up to you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not up to me!\u201d A flaming fist collided with the concrete, the impact resonating up Zuko\u2019s arm. He grimaced. \u201cMy father is responsible for the death of thousands\u2014he\u2019s made his bed. There is no choice involved here. The Firelord has to be taken out.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Hakoda prompted, and Zuko sighed.\n\u201cI know what needs to be done, but I\u2019m not happy about it.\u201d His hand ached. Dormant electricity prickled up his spine.\n\u201cThat\u2019s because you are a good son, Prince Zuko.\u201d\nAnd oh, what a tragic compliment.\n\u201cDon\u2019t think it will interfere with how I train Aang,\u201d came Zuko\u2019s steely promise. \u201cI won\u2019t hesitate to show him how to\u2026 do what he needs to do.\u201d He was not looking forward to having that conversation with a twelve-year-old, pacifist monk.\n\u201cYou\u2019re allowed to be sad, you know.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d His voice was barely a whisper. \u201cBut that\u2019s for afterward.\u201d\nAfterward, alone, at the graveside. Once the world was saved.\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t always evil, you know.\u201d Zuko flicked a piece of loose stone into the ravine. He did not hear it land. \u201cOur family was happy, once.\u201d There was a hand on his shoulder that wasn\u2019t Hakoda\u2019s\u2014it was bigger, warmer, and ghostly. There had been laughter, before the burning screams. Azula had liked to make sandcastles.\n\u201cPride and power can do terrible things to a man,\u201d Hakoda nodded. \u201cSome are more easily corrupted than others.\u201d\n\u201cI think it runs in the family.\u201d From Sozin to Azulon to Ozai to\u2026\nHakoda must have anticipated that train of thought. \u201cYou\u2019re not your father, Zuko.\u201d\n\u201cSozin was good once, too. And I\u2019ve chosen the wrong path many times before.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Hakoda\u2019s mouth was pressed into a firm line. \u201cYou were deliberately misguided, but never corrupted.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t kn\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYour presence here is all the proof I need.\u201d\n\nFrom Roku to Rina to Ursa to Zuko.\n\n\u201cThe crown still has a long and bloody history.\u201d\nHakoda quirked an eyebrow. \u201cThe crown is only as good as the man who\u2019s wearing it. Firelord Ozai has had to grab for power because he cannot earn respect. Instead, he relies on fear. That\u2019s no leader\u2014there\u2019s no honor in that.\u201d\nPerhaps, cried a little voice in Zuko\u2019s head, that\u2019s why he tried so hard to steal yours.\n\u201cYour men respect you, Chief Hakoda.\u201d A reasonable assumption. \u201cAnd you\u2019re so sure of yourself. But I can barely figure out my own path\u2014how can I expect others to follow?\u201d His eyes were wide with doubt and he looked to Hakoda for answers.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve had to struggle. But you have found your path now, and you did it on your own. Your people will respect you all the more for that.\u201d The chief gave a small smile. There was a proud hand on Zuko\u2019s back, real this time. \u201cYou will be an honorable leader, Prince Zuko. History will look fondly on you.\u201d\nZuko\u2019s inner fire breathed with him, swelled, and calmed.\n\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d the chief encouraged, giving Zuko\u2019s shoulder a final pat and standing up from the edge of the ravine. \u201cLet\u2019s go join the others at the fire. It\u2019s getting cold over here.\u201d Hakoda offered his arm to help Zuko up.\nThe prince accepted it with wry smile. \u201cYou\u2019re from the South Pole! I didn\u2019t know you could get cold.\u201d\n\u201cBut in the South Pole we have parkas,\u201d Hakoda noted, \u201cnot Fire Nation prison uniforms. And I\u2019m freezing.\u201d The chief turned to walk toward the others. Blinking, Zuko reached out to stop him.\n\u201cUh, I\u2026\u201d He scratched the back of his head. \u201cThank you.\u201d\nHakoda simply grinned. \u201cYou stopped my son from trying to break me out of prison on a flying bison. Consider us even.\u201d\nWith that, they walk back toward the fire, their friends and their family. Zuko found a place near Sokka, who grinned and held up his favorite weapon.\n\u201cZuko! You just missed it! I was just telling Suki, Toph, and Chit Sang all about when boomerang and I kicked your butt the first time we met.\u201d\nToph punched him in the arm.\u201cI\u2019d love to have been there for that one.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, and then there was that time with the pirates\u2026!\u201d\nZuko looked around the fire, closed his eyes, and smiled softly."
