    "text": "\u201cCongrats, by the way.\u201d Megumi says offhandedly over breakfast one morning, not quite making eye contact as he pokes at his eggs with an uncharacteristic level of stiffness. It makes Nobara freeze in place, cup of coffee pressed against her lips, eyes narrowing over the rim to stare him down suspiciously.\n\u201cFor what.\u201d She says, with no small amount of trepidation. Megumi clears his throat, resolutely not looking up.\n\u201cY\u2019know.\u201d He coughs. \u201cYou and Itadori.\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d Nobara nods, returning to her coffee, only really processing Megumi\u2019s words when she\u2019s got a sizeable mouthful. She chokes on a wheeze and spews it everywhere, gagging around her every breath, batting away the fistful of napkins Megumi offers her, choosing instead to conserve her energy to shriek, at the top of her lungs, \u201cWhat?\u201d\nMegumi grabs her wrist and stuffs the napkin into her grip, grabbing his own handful to start mopping at the puddle on the table. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re so surprised.\u201d He says, matter of fact, that strange bit of strain still grating every word that leaves his mouth. Nobara would probably take note of that if she wasn\u2019t trying to fight off death\u2019s cold coffee-scented embrace. \u201cSomeone was bound to notice with everything he\u2019s been doing for your two month anniversary.\u201d\n\u201cHrghf?\u201d She says intelligently. Megumi keeps slapping the napkin in the pool of coffee, even though it\u2019s soaked through and just making a bigger mess.\n\u201cEveryone knows.\u201d His voice is quiet and firm, and for a moment he stands there, staring into the stagnating pool of coffee. \u201cEveryone.\u201d\nHe puts the napkin on the table and picks up his half-finished meal and storms off to the kitchen looking like he\u2019s going to use a plate of runny eggs to commit a murder. Nobara finally gets some air back in her lungs and wheezes out, desperate and confused and concerned, \u201cwho the fuck\u00a0told you this?\u201d\n\u201cPanda-senpai.\u201d Megumi replies, more clipped and curt than he normally is. He disappears into the kitchen. There\u2019s the sound of plastic rustling, the sink running, and then he\u2019s storming back out, right back to his room, saying, \u201cI\u2019m going now.\u201d\n\u201cHave fun.\u201d Nobara replies faintly. The only response she gets is the firm slam of the door. And there she sits, alone in the dining room, soaked in now-cold coffee, left to ponder whether or not she\u2019s slipped into an alternate reality where her standards dipped so low to the point where she\u2019d date Itadori fucking Yuuji. Maybe this is just some horrible nightmare that happens to be incredibly realistic. Maybe the sensation of being covered in coffee is just a sign that she pissed the bed.\nShe pinches herself. Ow. Cool, not a dream or a nightmare. No bed wetting yet. She\u2019s still holding out for the parallel dimension thing, because at least if she somehow ended up in a bad timeline, it wouldn\u2019t be her mess to deal with.\nShe\u2019s often found that life isn\u2019t so kind. Nobara lets out a deep and soulful groan, dropping her head to the table and forgetting that it\u2019s covered in coffee. Great. Just her fucking luck.\n\u00bf?\nPanda\u2019s in the sparring room, sitting in what Nobara assumes to be his version of criss-cross applesauce, his hands(paws?) folded neatly in his lap. His eyes are closed, his breathing deep and purposeful, the literal image of zen, if zen just so happened to be a panda. Nobara frowns, shifting in place. She really\u00a0doesn\u2019t want to disturb him, partly because she doesn\u2019t want to be a dick but mostly because Panda can be pretty scary at times and she\u2019s not in the mood to get flung across the room.\nHowever. This is a crisis of the highest degree. Fear has no place in a mission as important as this one.\n\u201cPanda-senpai?\u201d She asks hesitantly, edging a little ways into the room. He doesn\u2019t even twitch, resolutely remaining in place. She raises her voice, trying again. \u201cExcuse me, Panda-senpai?\u201d\nNot so much as even a stutter in his breath. Nobara blinks. Damn, he must be really into it. The guilt grows, just a little, but desperate times call for desperate measures. She takes a deep breath, squares her shoulders and says, loud and clear, \u201cPanda-senpai!\u201d\nPanda shifts. Nobara freezes in place, feeling the very distinct and horrible feeling of fucking up in an incredible way. She waits with baited breath as a moment passes, and then another, and then\u2014\nSNNNNZZZRRRK. It\u2019s a noise so loud it seems to rattle the very foundation of the building, deafening in its volume and ferocious in its intensity. Nobara flinches, clapping her hands over her ears, and it\u2019s only when the high-pitched ringing in her ears has subsided that Nobara realizes that the noise wasn\u2019t the sound of a portal to hell opening beneath the school building, but instead Panda\u2019s snoring.\nNobara\u2019s jaw drops. \u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d She shrieks in dismay before charging forwards and round housing kicking Panda in the side. He jolts awake with a yelp, head swivelling wildly, quickly identifying his assailant mostly thanks to the fact that she kicks him again.\n\u201cOw, hey, what the fuck Nobara-chan!?\u201d He shouts, tucking his knees in and doing his adorable little panda roll away from her. Most of the time she stops and coos over him whenever he does that. This time she pulls out her nails and hammer and lifts them threateningly. Panda immediately lifts his paws(hands?) in surrender. \u201cOkay, okay! I\u2019m sorry!\u201d\n\u201cYou better be!\u201d She snaps, drawing herself up to her full one hundred and sixty centimetres, looming over his cowering form on the floor. \u201cWhy the fuck did you tell Fushiguro that I\u2019m dating Itadori?\u201d\nHe pauses, brightening for a moment. \u201cOh yeah, congrats about that by the way!\u201d He says brightly. Nobara lifts her hammer again. He returns to his cowering. \u201cI\u2019m also sorry! For spreading the news!\u201d\n\u201cFor spreading fake\u00a0news.\u201d Nobara corrects him darkly.\nPanda blinks. \u201cOh. Really?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cY\u2019know, that checks out.\u201d He muses thoughtfully. \u201cI never thought you guys were into each other and I was kinda weirded out when Shoko-sensei told me but then I was like y\u2019know, I gotta support the homies\u2014\u201c\n\u201cWait.\u201d Nobara\u2019s jaw drops. \"Shoko-sensei told you that we\u2019re dating?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cLike, big mama MILF Shoko-sensei?\u201d\n\u201cBig what?\u201d\n\u201cNever mind!\u201d Nobara squeaks. There is. So\u00a0much happening. She starts backing out of the room, mind racing a mile a minute. \u201cJust. Don\u2019t tell anyone else. At all. I have to go.\u201d\nPanda lifts one of his hand-paw-things and waves. \u201cOkay!\u201d He says, much too put together for just having been held hostage. \u201cSee you later!\u201d\n\u201cWatch your fucking back Panda-senpai!\u201d Nobara shouts back, because she\u2019s got a reputation to maintain god damn it.\n\u00bf?\n\u201cOh, Nobara.\u201d Shoko says pleasantly, elbow deep in what looks like a human body. Maybe. It\u2019s quite mangled, so Nobara\u2019s not quite sure. Shoko\u2019s smile is serene, one hand emerging from the body with a squelch to wave at Nobara. She\u2019s holding a very large knife.\n\u201cHi sensei.\u201d Nobara waves back, albeit a little faintly. Listen. She\u2019s a sorcerer. Dealt with curses her whole life. Lives with two stinky boys. She\u2019s not some weak little bitch. But there is an absurd amount of blood on the table and on Shoko\u2019s jacket and on\u2026 everything. Really.\n\u201cIf you need anything I\u2019m a little occupied at the moment.\u201d Shoko says, gesturing at the body like Nobara might have happened to miss it, somehow. \u201cBut there\u2019s Tylenol and cough drops in the top drawer.\u201d\n\u201cNo I\u2019ll be\u2014\u201c Nobara starts, stopping when she realizes that there is, in fact the beginnings of a headache behind her eyes. She\u2019s got the shitty feeling that it\u2019s not going away any time soon. \u201cY\u2019know what, thanks sensei.\u201d\n\u201cAnytime.\u201d Shoko turns back to the body. What\u2019s left of it, anyways. Nobara shuffles over to the cabinet, tugging open the top drawer. There\u2019s lemon cough drops, a half open bottle of TUMS, what appears to be a human hand floating in a light green liquid, and a vape pen. No Tylenol. Nobara sighs and closes the drawer.\n\u201cUh, sensei?\u201d She starts, tentatively. Shoko hums her reply. \u201cUm. So, Panda-senpai told me something kinda weird\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt was perfectly legal at the time.\u201d Shoko replies tersely. There\u2019s a sickening squelch from the body.\nNobara blinks. \u201cWhat? What was legal?\u201d\nShoko turns and blinks back. \u201cOh, so it wasn\u2019t about the Yokohama thing?\u201d She asks, tilting her head.\nNobara feels distinctly like she\u2019s having a fucking stroke. \u201cWhat? What Yokohama thing? No I\u2019m talking about him thinking that Itadori and I were dating.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Shoko says, and then whispers what sounds suspiciously like \u201cthank fucking God.\u201d\n\u201cSo uh.\u201d Nobara wets her lips. \u201cWe\u2019re not? Dating?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I figured.\u201d Shoko laughs, shaking her head. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like I told Panda that you were dating, I told him that I heard\u00a0you two were dating.\u201d\nNobara sighs. Finally, she\u2019s getting somewhere. \u201cWho\u2019d you hear it from?\u201d She asks, as innocently as possible.\nShoko smiles at her, all too knowing. \u201cInumaki-kun.\u201d She says sweetly.\nNobara blinks. \u201cNo way.\u201d\n\u201cI did.\u201d\n\u201cSensei, please.\u201d\nShoko shrugs. \u201cI\u2019ve given you all the information I can offer.\u201d She turns back to the body on the table. \u201cNow, if that\u2019s all you needed from me\u2014\u201c She shoves her hand back in. The body starts fucking screaming.\nNobara stumbles away. \u201cYes that\u2019ll be all thank you!\u201d She shrieks, running out the door at a full tilt, leaving the fucking horror movie behind her.\n\u00bf?\nIt takes Nobara the better part of an hour to track down Inumaki, mostly because he was sitting on the roof the entire time. She can\u2019t really be mad at him for it cause. Well, it\u2019s Inumaki. Just the sight of him, cross legged with a box of pocky and a juice box on the ground in front of him, pensively staring out at the horizon as he methodically unwraps his snack\u2014 it's enough to make her pause, enough to quell her frantic frenzy just the slightest. \nNobara clears her throat. \u201cInumaki-senpai?\u201d She calls. His gaze snaps to her, eyes brightening with recognition.\n\u201cSalmon!\u201d He replies brightly, waving her over and patting the spot on the ground next to him. Nobara can\u2019t help but grin back, dusting off the spot he clears and folding her legs beneath her to sit next to him. He tilts his head, offering one pocky to her. \u201cSalmon?\u201d\n\u201cNo thanks Senpai?\u201d She replies. He shrugs, popping it into his mouth. They sit in silence for a moment, staring out at the treetops together.\n\u201cLeaf mustard?\u201d He asks, nudging her slightly.\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m good.\u201d She replies. He blinks at her, pocky still hanging between his lips, before bringing both hands up to make a heart. He traces little curves in the space just under his eyes, pointing at her again. \u201cAre you asking if me and Itadori are dating?\u201d\n\u201cSalmon.\u201d\nNobara sighs. \u201cWe\u2019re not.\u201d She grumbles. She can\u2019t yell at Inumaki cause it\u2019s morally equivalent to punching a kitten. Inumaki hums, crunching on the pocky a little more. \u201cInumaki-senpai, where\u2019d you hear that we were dating?\u201d\nInuamki blinks at her. He holds up two fingers. \u201cHold on, are we doing charades right now?\u201d Nobara asks, mostly joking.\n\u201cSalmon.\u201d Inumaki replies, looking deadly serious.\nNobara is frankly floored. \u201cAll right. So, two syllables?\u201d She guesses. Inumaki gives a thumbs up. He puts one hand behind his head in a fist, twisting his face into a scowl. \u201cAre you pretending to be them?\u201d\n\u201cSalmon.\u201d\n\u201cUh, okay, um\u2026\u201d Nobara frowns, and then, very hesitantly says, \u201cis it\u2026 Maki-senpai?\u201d\nInumaki bends over and shakes with silent laughter for two whole minutes, ignoring Nobara\u2019s desperate pleas for him to never\u00a0tell Maki-senpai she said that please Inumaki-senpai spare her for the love of God.\nEventually he calms down, wiping away tears from his eyes with the palm of his hand. He points to his left eye, drawing a triangle over it, one edge running along the path of his hairline and one point ending somewhere in the middle of his cheek. He traces its path again.\nNobara squints. \u201cIs that a scar?\u201d She asks, cheering when Inumaki gives her a double thumbs up. The joy quickly dissipates when the realization sets in. \u201cWait, you\u2019re telling me fucking Todo told you that me and Itadori were dating?\u201d\n\u201cSalmon.\u201d Inumaki nods, miming the act of texting. Nobara stares at him.\n\u201cWhy do you have Aoi Todo\u2019s phone number?\u201d\n\u201cTuna mayo.\u201d\n\u201cWhat does that\u00a0mean!?\u201d\n\u00bf?\nHey Todo. &lt;&lt;\nSenpai. &lt;&lt;\nMan I really don\u2019t wanna call you senpai &lt;&lt;\n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt; WHO IS THIS\n&gt;&gt; WHO DID YOU GET MY INFORMATION\njesus fucking christ &lt;&lt;\nit\u2019s kugisaki. from tokyo. &lt;&lt;\n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt; AH KUGISAKI MY FRIEND\ndelete my number after this conversation I swear to fucking god &lt;&lt;\nalso can you quit it with the all caps &lt;&lt;\n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt; I CANNOT FIGURE OUT HOW\nof course &lt;&lt;\n&gt;&gt; WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU KUGISAKI?\nokay im gonna cut to the chase &lt;&lt;\ndid you tell inumaki-senpai that me and itadori were dating?? &lt;&lt;\n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt; I DID\n&gt;&gt; I WANTED TO CELEBRATE YOUR UNION\nokay well we\u2019re not so thanks for that &lt;&lt;\nalso why would you say it like that &lt;&lt;\n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt; MY BROTHER IS A MAN OF HONOUR!\nthat doesn\u2019t make any sense &lt;&lt;\n&gt;&gt; LOVE VERY OFTEN DOES\nWE\u2019RE NOT IN LOVE FFS &lt;&lt;\nWHO EVEN TOLD YOU THAT WE\u2019RE DATING &lt;&lt;\n&gt;&gt; THERE\u2019S NO NEED TO BE SHY KUGISAKI\n&gt;&gt; LOVE IS SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL\n&gt;&gt; AND WHILE YOU MAY NOT FIT MY BROTHER\u2019S IDEAL TYPE\n&gt;&gt; IT MUST BE CELEBRATED!!\nwe\u2019re not dating &lt;&lt;\nwait &lt;&lt;\nwhat is itadori\u2019s ideal type &lt;&lt;\n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt; HE LIKES TALL AND VOLUPTUOUS WOMEN, WHO HAVE BEEN GIFTED WITH A ROUND DERRIERE\nitadori\u2019s an ass man??? &lt;&lt;\nhuh &lt;&lt;\nwait didn\u2019t you just say that i\u2019m short and that I have a flat ass?? &lt;&lt;\n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt; I MEANT NO OFFENSE\nI\u2019m going to fucking kill you todo &lt;&lt;\ngod you\u2019re distracting me!! &lt;&lt;\nwhere\u2019d you even hear this shit from &lt;&lt;\n&gt;&gt; WHY I HEASDRFSDKJFBFGFK\nhello?? &lt;&lt;\ntodo ???? &lt;&lt;\ndid you fucking die &lt;&lt;\n&gt;&gt; unfortunately he\u2019s still alive\nwho is this?? &lt;&lt;\n&gt;&gt; it\u2019s mai zenin\noh &lt;&lt;\nwhat the fuck &lt;&lt;\nwhy are you here &lt;&lt;\n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt; mostly cause todo was being annoying\n&gt;&gt; and I need him to shut the fuck up\n&gt;&gt; but then I saw that he was texting the bitch who broke my sister\u2019s heart\nwhat &lt;&lt;\nwait WHAT &lt;&lt;\n&gt;&gt; yeah, she texted me crying cause the girl she liked so much ended up dating the shitty little cursed twerp and I off-handedly mentioned that I was going to kill for it and this fucking oaf decided to go spreading the news\nyou told todo? &lt;&lt;\nmaki-san told you?? &lt;&lt;\nMAKI-SAN LIKES ME??? &lt;&lt;\n&gt;&gt; that\u2019s what I just said\nholy shit I have to go &lt;&lt;\n&gt;&gt; you better fix this or I\u2019ll rip your teeth out\nfuck you too Mai &lt;&lt;\nthank you though &lt;&lt;\n&gt;&gt; tch\nyou seriously did not just &lt;&lt;\n\u2018tch\u2019 &lt;&lt;\nme over text &lt;&lt;\n&gt;&gt; MY APOLOGIES KUGISAKI\n&gt;&gt; I WAS SUDDENLY ACCOSTED\ndude. &lt;&lt;\n\u00bf?\nThe path to Maki\u2019s room is one Nobara\u2019s walked a thousand times. Dragging Panda to her door to rat him out for being weird, begging for help with the impossible math homework Gojou likes to inflict on them, simply heading over for movies and popcorn and conversations. She\u2019s familiar with it, but this time, for some reason, every step she takes is laden with dread. Her heart sits high in her throat. Her hands are slick with sweat.\nShe knocks on the door, three times, neat and sharp. She waits, her mouth dry, her hands shaking.\nMaki opens the door. She looks awful. Deep bags beneath her eyes, skin pale and hair tangled. She\u2019s wearing a too big black sweater that she seems to be trying to melt into. She looks at Nobara and something awful twists her face. \u201cAh.\u201d She says, sounding absolutely exhausted. \u201cNobara.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not dating Itadori.\u201d Nobara blurts. She feels her face heat. \u201cMaki-san\u2014\u201c\nMaki offers her a smile, weary and worn. \u201cIt\u2019s okay Nobara.\u201d She says, all too gently. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to lie.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not lying!\u201d Nobara is going to burn this fucking building to the ground, and then kill Itadori with her own two hands this time. \u201cMaki-san, I don\u2019t even have a crush on him, we\u2019re not dating we never were dating, I\u2019d rather eat my own shit\u00a0than date him\u2014\u201c\n\u201cI\u2019m happy for you.\u201d Maki-san lies, like a lying liar. Nobara feels like she\u2019s going fucking crazy. \u201cReally Nobara, you deserve\u2014\u201c\nThankfully, Maki stops talking then, but mostly because Nobara grabs the front of her hoodie and pulls her down into a kiss. Her eyes screwed shut, her knuckles white around the fabric, her heart beating in her ears, Nobara tries to push every single bit of reason that Maki refuses to hear through her lips. Tries to make her understand.\nNobara pulls away. God, she probably looks like a fucking tomato. Maki looks stunning, red flush high on her cheeks, lips parted and shiny. She brings one hand up, touching them, looking somewhat dazed. \u201cYou\u2026\u201d She starts, trailing off, someone blushing harder.\n\u201cMaki-san.\u201d Nobara says fiercely. \u201cI like you so fucking much. I have big dumb sapphic feelings for you. Itadori is stinky and stupid and he fucking eats fingers. No way in hell am I putting my lips anywhere his mouth.\u201d\nMaki stares at her dumbly for a moment, and then another. The air between them is thick and still. Nobara\u2019s heart pounds somewhere in her throat. Her ears somehow grow even warmer. She adds, just to be careful, \u201csorry I did that without your permission by the way.\u201d\nMaki\u2019s eyes crinkle in the corners and she leans her head against the doorframe and closes her eyes and laughs. Bright and high and happy, like windchimes and dewdrops and the smell of fresh crepes and macaroons. \u201cGood lord.\u201d She gasps. She pulls Nobara in, nestling her cheek on the crown of Nobara\u2019s head. Nobara closes her eyes, breathing in the scent of Maki all around her. \u201cWhat a mess\u00a0this all is.\u201d\nNobara whines, weakly hitting her shoulder. \u201cI did nothing wrong!\u201d She protests, giggling through her words, feeling almost giddy when she hears Maki\u2019s laughter start again. \u201cIf there wasn\u2019t a stupid rumour mill going round that my standards were low enough to date Itadori then we wouldn\u2019t be in this mess! I still need to know who told you\u00a0this shit!\u201d\n\u201cOh I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d Maki says. Delight rings clear in every syllable. She steps back, bringing one hand down to Nobara\u2019s waist, smile brightening at the sound of Nobara\u2019s squeak of surprise. \u201cBut first I wanna just\u2026\u201d\nShe pulls Nobara through the door. It clicks shut behind them.\nIt doesn\u2019t open again for a very long time.\n\u00bf?\nNobara\u2019s pretty close to blowing a fucking gasket upon hearing the identity of Maki\u2019s informant, and is pretty sure the only reason she doesn\u2019t completely lose her shit is because Maki\u2019s hand is really soft and running gently through her hair and it feels. Really nice. She\u2019s not even that mad when she has to leave, getting a few goodbye kisses at the door, practically skipping down the halls of the building. Her good mood quickly evaporates at the sight of her culprit, lounging on the sofa with an obscenely large latte like he\u2019s king of the fucking castle. Which he kind of is. Doesn\u2019t stop it from being annoying though.\n\u201cGojou-sensei.\u201d Nobara says with the utmost severity. She strides into the room, arms crossed, chin high. \u201cI need to talk to you.\u201d\n\u201cAh, the other half of the happy couple!\u201d He greets cheerfully. She\u2019s certain his bright blue eyes are sparkling under that stupid blindfold of his. \u201cWhat can I do for you, Kugisaki?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not dating Itadori.\u201d Nobara grinds out through gritted teeth. \u201cAnd I want to know where you heard something as stupid\u00a0as that.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not?\u201d Gojou asks with a tilt of his head. It\u2019s just shy of genuine shock, which means that bastard knew and still\u00a0told Maki, the fucking prick. \u201cWell that\u2019s a surprise. My source was quite reliable, after all.\u201d\n\u201cAnd who is said source.\u201d Nobara slams her hand on the arm of the sofa. It\u2019s not that effective, considering it\u2019s fabric and doesn\u2019t make a lot of noise.\nGojou smiles at her serenely. \u201cWhy, I heard it straight from the horse\u2019s mouth!\u201d\nNobara stares at him. \u201cWhat.\u201d\n\u201cI caught him shopping for your anniversary present.\u201d His smile goes sharp in the corners. \u201cReally sweet of him, he\u2019s definitely a keeper.\u201d\n\n\u201dWHAT.\u201d\n\n\u00bf?\n\u201cITADORI FUCKING YUUJI.\u201d Nobara shouts, kicking down the door to his room. The culprit in question shouts, falling off his bed, looking up at her from the floor. His eyes grow wide.\n\u201cOh shit.\u201d He mutters, scrambling to his feet.\n\u201cYeah, no fucking kidding, I\u2019m gonna fucking kill\u00a0you.\u201d Nobara seethes, storming forwards, slamming a fist down on the top of his head.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to!\u201d He cries, ducking out of the way of her next swing. \u201cHonest, it just slipped out, it was a mistake!\u201d\n\u201cHow do you accidentally tell Gojou-sensei that I\u2019m your girlfriend!\u201d She roars, lunging for him. He yelps and dives out of the way. \u201cWhat the fuck is wrong\u00a0with you?\u201d\n\u201cI needed to tell him something!\u201d Yuuji shouts back. \u201cHe started asking questions about what I bought, and I just panicked\u2014\u201c\n\u201cAnd said that we\u2019re dating?\u201d Nobara stares at him incredulously. \u201cHow does that explain anything? What the fuck were you even buying?\u201d\nYuuji blanches, avoids her gaze, ducks his head to the floor. He mumbles something, low and quick and quiet. Nobara frowns. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d\nHe mumbles again. Nobara groans, massaging the bridge of her nose. \u201cSeriously, Itadori, I can\u2019t fucking hear you\u2014\u201c\n\u201cIt was a skirt!\u201d He snaps. He lifts his head. His eyes are bright, his face is burning. By his sides, his hands are clenched into fists, so tight Nobara wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he opened them to show off his bleeding palms. He takes a deep breath, shaky and uncertain. \u201cI wanted to buy a skirt.\u201d He repeats, quieter this time.\nNobara feels like she\u2019s been slapped in the face. \u201cItadori\u2014\u201c\n\u201cThey just, look so pretty.\u201d He\u2019s saying, quiet and miserable Nobara didn\u2019t even know he could ever look this uncertain, look this scared. \u201cAnd there was one in this store that I couldn\u2019t stop looking at, but I couldn\u2019t try it on there were so many people so I just bought one and I was going to wear it at home but that was when Gojou-sensei was looking for me to get us back on the train and he saw me buy it and I had to say something\u2014\u201c\nThe bone-crushing hug she yanks him into is less of a conscious thought and more of a primal impulse, an instinctual reaction to the sight of the fat tears leaking out from the corners of Yuuji\u2019s eyes. Yuuji reacts to her touch with a full body shudder before his hands latch onto her shoulders and he curls over her frame, trembling like she\u2019s the only tether to earth that he has. \u201cit\u2019s okay.\u201d Nobara says, her own voice thick and shaking. She can\u2019t really reach his hair so she runs her hand along his back in soothing motions, letting him press sobs into her shoulder. \u201cI understand now, it\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have used you either.\u201d He sniffles. \u201cI didn\u2019t have to say it was you, I could\u2019ve made up a name, or said it was secret.\u201d\n\u201cNo, Itadori\u2014\u201d Nobara starts, and then stops, and then sighs. \u201cYeah, you probably should\u2019ve done that instead.\u201d Yuuji chokes out a little laugh. She gets on her tip-toes, reaching up to noogie him as best as she can, evidently successful based on his offended little squawk. \u201cYou could\u2019ve also told Gojou-sensei the truth, and let me kick his ass if he made fun of you.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s the strongest sorcerer in the world.\u201d\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s immune to an ass kicking.\u201d Nobara mutters. Yuuji laughs, stepping back. His eyes are red and his smile is bright and wobbly. She pats his arm, the motion just as clumsy as her words when she says, \u201cYou good?\u201d\nYuuji wrinkles his nose, sniffling, \u201cStop being nice to me, it\u2019s weirding me out.\u201d\n\u201cAll right, go fuck yourself.\u201d Nobara fires back immediately. He laughs, gently and affectionately punching her arm. She smacks him back with all the force she can muster. Still affectionately though, even if Yuuji doesn\u2019t seem to appreciate it. \u201cI\u2019m always this kind.\u201d\n\u201cSure.\u201d Yuuji says dubiously, laughing again and dodging her next swing. He rolls onto his bed, shifting over to let Nobara take a seat on the edge. They sit in silence for a moment, Nobara looking at the posters on the wall, Yuuji staring up at his ceiling. The silence is broken by the mattress creaking beneath him as he sits up and shuffles next to her. \u201cBy the way, how\u2019d you even find out about this?\u201d\nNobara sighs, rolling her eyes, elbowing him in the ribs.\u00a0 Lightly, of course, because she\u2019s being nice. \u201cItadori. Everyone thinks we\u2019re dating.\u201d\nHe stares at her dumbly. \u201cOkay?\u201d\nShe turns with a growl, grabbing his stupid face with both her hands and smacking his forehead with her own. She pinches his cheek when he blinks, forcing him to stare right into her unwavering glare. When I say everyone, I meaneveryone.\u201d\u00a0She hisses, low and purposeful. Yuuji blinks back at her.\nSomething hits the floor. The two of them spring into action, Yuuji jumping to his feet and shifting his weight, bending low, ready to pounce. Nobara lets her hammer slide out from her sleeve, bringing up two nails between her fingers. They turn to face the noise and are greeted with the sight of Megumi, grocery bags tipped over by his feet, contents spilling across the floor, his hands slack by his side. His dark eyes are blown wide, a deep pink high on his face. There\u2019s something incredibly open there, but open in the way of shattered glass.\nNobara straightens, hands coming up. \u201cFushiguro\u2014\u201c\n\u201cSorry. I got\u2014 I\u2019ll just\u2014\u201c He stammers, stumbling back and out the door, not looking at either of them, not picking up the bags on the floor, seemingly not aware of the tears that well in his eyes and carve lines through the open heartbreak on his face. The door slams shut behind him, its finality echoing through every inch of the room.\nYuuji turns to look at her, eyes wide, something akin to horror spread across his face. \u201cEveryone?\u201d He asks, high and panicked.\nNobara buries her face in her palms and wonder when her life of sorcery and curses devolved into a B-List romcom. \u201cYes you fucking moron.\u201d She sighs, more exhausted than she ever thought she could be.\n\u201cOh my god. Fushiguro thinks we\u2019re dating. Oh my fucking God everyone thinks we\u2019re dating.\u201d Yuuji babbles, voice pitching higher and higher as the reality of this miserable miscommunication hits him harder and harder. \u201cOh my fucking god.\u201d\n\u201cYeah you dipshit, your crush thinks you\u2019re dating someone else.\u201d Nobara groans into her palms. \u201cSo how are we going to fix this.\nShe feels him freeze next to her. \u201cHow\u2019d you know I have a crush on him?\u201d He asks, bewildered.\n\u201cItadori, I swear to God.\u201d\n\u201cRight! Sorry, focusing.\u201d\n\u00bf?\nMegumi comes to breakfast the next morning looking downright miserable. There are deep bags beneath his red eyes, his normally messy hair looks downright disastrous. There\u2019s a bone deep exhaustion radiating from every single part of him. He avoids eye-contact with Nobara, not even grunting out a greeting, stumbling to the kitchen like a dead man walking.\nNobara watches him, quietly sipping her coffee.\nShe waits until he\u2019s returned with his plate, collapsing into the chair across from her and half heartedly picking at his food. \u201cGood morning, Fushiguro.\u201d She says sweetly. Megumi grunts. \u201cYou know, if you had waited just a little longer yesterday\u2014\u201c\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t Kugisaki.\u201d Megumi says. His voice is rough with emotion. \u201cPlease. I\u2019ll\u2026 I\u2019ll get over this, okay? Please just. Don\u2019t.\u201d\nNobara blinks, shrugging. \u201cOkay.\u201d She says, and pulls out her phone.\nThey sit in silence, Megumi mechanically working his way through his plate, Nobara tapping away at her phone. He\u2019s wound tight with tension. Nobara rolls her neck and lets it crack into the air.\nMegumi winces at the sound, freezing then sighing. He puts down his chopsticks. \u201cKugisaki\u2014\u201c\n\u201cOh hey guys!\u201d Maki brightly says, sweeping into the first year kitchens with a broad smile on her face. She nods at Megumi, and then bends down, pressing a kiss to Nobara\u2019s lips. \u201cHey babe, ready for our date today?\u201d\nNobara grins up at her. Out of the corner of her eye, she can see Megumi\u2019s dumbstruck expression in its full, stunned, stupid\u00a0glory. \u201cYou bet!\u201d She smiles back, leaning up and kissing Maki again. She turns as she stands, waving at Megumi. \u201cSee you later Fushiguro!\u201d\nShe\u2019s halfway out the door when she hears Yuuji\u2019s voice, somehow uncertain and nervous but still bright and firm. He calls out Megumi\u2019s name, the each syllable quieter than the last. She rolls her eyes. She told him to be confident about it, to assert himself and stride forwards with confidence. Then again, it was hard enough to get him to agree to this plan at all. She already had to concede to letting him pick out the rest of his outfit.\nShe wonders how the scene looks, behind her. Fushiguro hasn\u2019t gotten up yet, there was no sound of chair scraping against the floor or his distinct heavy footsteps. Is he staring at her back or has he turned to face Yuuji? Are his hands slack by his sides or have them been brought up to run through his hair like he always does when he\u2019s nervous? She saw the skirt Yuuji bought, a hideous pleated hot pink and lime green checkered monstrosity that falls right to the centre of his thighs. God, she hopes that he didn\u2019t pair it with his yellow hoodie. She\u2019s almost certain that she did.\nA few feet ahead of her, Maki turns around, meeting Nobara\u2019s gaze with eyes that are warm and sparkling. \u201cEverything good?\u201d She asks, a smile playing at her lips.\nNobara beams back. \u201cOh yeah.\u201d She replies, grabbing the handle of the door on her way out and closing it quietly behind her."
