    "notes": "<p>This was supposed to be 3K max. I started this before Helping Hands, but it flew out of control. I've spent so much time fiddling with this fic, I'm so happy to finally upload it.</p>\n<p>I've been thinking a lot about how the world might react to underage heroes. I mean, being a superhero is DANGEROUS. Really, really dangerous, and likely to end in major injury or death. Teenagers, out on a battlefield? Lots of adults are going to be very upset about that. </p>\n<p>Some housekeeping:<br>-Peter is 16, nearing 17.<br>-Super is slang for superhuman/superhero.<br>-I love Nova, but I had to have an underage superhero die to kick start the story, so. *shrugs* Pretend it\u2019s another, nameless Super, if it bugs you too much.<br>-I'm not American. Hopefully this is not too obvious.</p>\n<p>EDIT: Cover art is by the wonderful bitterbiracialbibliophile on tumblr! Thanks so much!</p>\n<p>EDIT (2): More <a href=\"https://starpaw0007.tumblr.com/post/162678997499/fanart-for-the-spider-man-fanfiction-safeguard\" rel=\"nofollow\">art</a> by starpaw0007. Thank you!</p>\n<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#work_endnotes\">more notes</a> and <a href=\"#children\">other works inspired by this one</a>.)</p>\n<p>I know, Deadpool is the poster boy for shitty morals, but I think even some characters must have things they aren\u2019t okay with. Here, Deadpool\u2019s is consent. (And the character himself has a history of sexual abuse in the comics, SO.) I ship Peter with a lot of people, but I hate ships that depict Peter in high school, dating someone in their late 20s/30s. Little 15/16 year olds dating people 30+? Creepy. CREEPY. Also, very illegal. </p>\n<p>I love the Avengers, including Tony. However, the man\u2019s roles in some things (Ultron, Civil War, ect) make me so mad. I can love a character and admit they still have a lot of faults. The Avengers are my favourite superhero group, and I write them as the softest, kindest sweethearts. And maybe I made Tony more dickish than usual in this\u2014especially considering the fact that I usually write him as a secretly schmoopy, selfless individual\u2014but hey. Whatever.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>WOAH, this is the longest thing I\u2019ve ever written? It's taken a lot of time, effort, and blood, and so feedback is very much appreciated. :)</p>",
    "text": "\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, no,\u201d Peter says, words slipping out on a rough exhale.\nHe swallows around his mouthful of pancake. The food has turned bland and rubbery in his mouth. It no longer tastes like syrup and choc chips, but something equally familiar, something that taste a little like grief, a lot like panic.\n\u201cHm?\u201d Aunt May looks up from where she\u2019s cutting her own pancakes. She sees his face, slack and ashen, and sits up straight.\n\u201cPeter?\u201d she prompts. \u201cHoney?\u201d\nStare fixed on the small TV in their kitchen, Peter simply shakes his head. Aunt May looks over, sees the Breaking News, and gasps.\nThe TV is on mute, but the script along the bottom of the screen reads: Super killed in battle \u2014 revealed to be 15 years old.\n\u201cMy god,\u201d Aunt May murmurs, hands clapped over her mouth.\nThe footage cuts to a vaguely familiar streak of black and gold being caught around the middle and thrown to the ground. A much larger figure pounces on top of the Super. The villain\u2019s huge clawed hand curls around the Super\u2019s torso, reaching up and snatching an identifiable helmet off their head\u2014\nPeter stands suddenly, chair scraping loudly against the tiles. \u201cNova!\u201d\nThe villain has Nova pinned, looming over him. He holds a huge, jagged sword aloft, before arching his back, bringing it down and plunging the blade\u2014\nAunt May cries out and flinches away, eyes squeezing shut. Peter can\u2019t breath; he\u2019s heard of Nova, knows Supers who are close with him. Peter had met him once, very briefly, caught the end of the other\u2019s bad quip before he\u2019d flown away.\nPeter reaches over and turns the volume up.\n\u201cLike many Supers,\u201d the newswoman says, \u201cNova had maintained a secret identity throughout his career. His name and age were unknown until last night. His death has sparked a controversial, national debate on the ethnics of Supers and secret identities. Have other children taken up dangerous heroism under the guise of a mask? And if so, what is being done to protect our children?\u201d\nPeter feels strangely hot, scrutinised somehow, like he\u2019s under a magnifying glass, a thousand eyes trained on him.\nThey replay the footage again, though sharply cut it short, ending before Nova\u2019s abrupt death. Peter thinks, frantically, that could\u2019ve been me. Might just be, one day.\n\u201c15 years old,\u201d Aunt May says sadly. \u201cWhat a tragedy\u2026 He\u2019s only a year younger than you, Peter.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter says, numbly.\nThe news woman places a finger to her ear, listening to something. She straightens, and says, \u201cI\u2019ve just received word that the death of the Super Nova and the subsequent national call for action, has resulted in Congress accelerating the Bill concerning the identification of underage Supers that has been in debate for some time now.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Peter chokes.\n\u201cOh, good,\u201d Aunt May says, and Peter stares at her, betrayed. \u201cI think almost everyone in this city wants to protect our heroes. I\u2019m glad the government is on our side on this.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter says, because he feels like he has to.\nAunt May goes back to her breakfast, and Peter stares down at his pancakes. He inhales deep, grounding breaths, and tries to convince himself that this isn\u2019t the beginning of the end.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPeter sees the first sign of it on his way to class\u2014he\u2019s not late, for once, walking leisurely with his skateboard tucked under one arm, and so has time to look around, let his stare wander.\nA small, family run connivence store that Peter frequents sometimes, has posted a sign in its store window. It\u2019s not too large, clearly homemade. In orange WordArt it reads, Friendly Supers welcome! Supers in need shop for free. Water, food, first aid\u2014we got your back!\nThere\u2019s a little sketch of Captain Marvel striking a winning pose in the corner. Peter stares at it, dumbstruck.\n\u201cHuh,\u201d he says. That\u2019s new.\nHe passes three electronics stores on his way to school. Large flat-screens are displayed in all of the shiny storefronts. Most of them are playing the news coverage of Nova. Every time Peter sees it, he feels suddenly bereft of air.\nAll day, his classmates are talking about Nova\u2019s death. Most says it\u2019s so sad and such a tragedy. Some scoff and ask, what\u2019s the big deal? Who cares?, and Peter has to wrestle down the urge to punch someone.\nTo his classmates, Nova is a distanced figure, a Super on the other side of the city that slipped up in battle and payed for it. To Peter, he\u2019s something else. Someone like him. Someone he could\u2019ve called friend.\nNova\u2019s age is mentioned in conversation often\u2014the topic is even openly discussed in Peter\u2019s Lit class. When his teacher looks his way, prompts him to join the discussion on the merits of secret identities, Peter shakes his head.\nHe swallows, and offers up his shyest look. \u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t really have the authority to comment on something like that,\u201d he says. He hears Flash snort several rows behind him, agreeing.\nThe teacher purses her lips, but looks away and draws on someone else. Peter is relieved, though his stomach is still tangled in knots, and it is hard to breath around the lump in his throat.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s on the news a few days later.\n\u201cThe Bill concerning underage Supers received a yes vote today,\" a newsman says. \u201cThe Bill, if successfully passed, will identify all Supers who are under the age of 18 years old, similar to what people are calling the Superhuman Registration Act, which is still in the early stages of development.\u201d\n\u201cTurn it off,\u201d Peter says, thickly swallowing his mouthful of mashed potatoes. His upset stomach can barely handle his Aunt\u2019s beautiful cooking tonight, let alone that kind of news.\n\u201cPeter?\u201d Aunt May asks, eyebrows pinching together.\nHe reaches across the table and takes one of her hands in his, running his thumb over her wrinkled knuckles. He is painfully aware that he may lose her one day. This comfortable, domestic setting cannot last forever. With Uncle Ben, Peter hadn\u2019t realised that. Now, he can\u2019t forget it.\n\u201cI just want to talk to you, Aunt May. Can we not focus on politics?\u201d\nAunt May smiles, touched. \u201cOh, Peter, of course we can.\u201d\nThe newsman is still discussing the acceleration of the Bill; \u201cIt is likely the Underage Superhuman Act will pass sometime in the next week--\"\nAunt May turns off the TV.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPeter avoids the TV for the better half of the week. He blocks out any conversation near him about the Bill, and runs away from this the best he can.\nLike always, it comes back to bite him in the ass, ambushing him in the form of Tony Stark.\nHe corners Peter on a high up rooftop. Peter stares, mouth agape under his mask. \u201cIron Man?\u201d he asks, voice far higher than usual.\nTony Stark\u2014Peter can physically feel the part of his brain that deals with coherent speech shutting down, because woah\u2014steps forward. The man is resplendent in red and gold, armour glinting in the afternoon sun. Peter watches, awed, as Tony holds out a gauntlet, something blue clasped tight in metal fingers.\n\u201cI come baring gifts,\u201d Tony says, gesturing for Peter to take the handful of fabric. Peter does so, and unfolds it. He holds it up.\n\u201cUm,\u201d Peter begins, eyeing the baby blue jacket. \u201cThanks?\u201d\n\u201cThe Underage Superhuman Act passed this morning,\u201d Tony explains, and Peter feels his blood turn to ice. \u201cThat\u2019s the standard issued jacket to publicly identify underage Supers.\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Peter asks. The jacket is trembling in his hands, and he feels cold all over, stomach like lead, heart beating wildly. \u201cThis is a\u2014a\u2014\u201d\n\u201cRegulation Jacket,\u201d Tony finishes.\nPeter throws it to the ground and scrambles back on shaky legs. \u201cI\u2019m Spider-Man. Man! How do you even know I\u2019m underage\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSHIELD is a very extensive organisation,\u201d Tony says, coming forward, scooping up the jacket and holding it out once more. Peter flinches away from it. \u201cThey keep track of high-profile cases, and despite the bright spandex and the whole high-schooler thing, you\u2019re a very high-profile case.\u201d\nPeter is in shock, numb. When Tony lifts his arms and guides him into the jacket, Peter doesn\u2019t fight it. He doesn\u2019t move when Tony zips him into the baby blue jacket, or when he steps away, surveying Peter, nodding to himself.\nPeter stutters a little when Tony\u2019s boots whine, firing up. \u201cIt\u2019s the law, kid,\u201d Tony tells him, perhaps trying for reassuring.\nPeter does not feel reassured.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe coat is a pale baby blue\u2014could they have picked a more childish colour? Bleugh! \u2014with its collar sitting snug under his chin. It\u2019s small, ending halfway up his torso and flaring slightly around his ribs, its short sleeves sticking out.\nEverything from the colour\u2014blue so light it stands out in stark contrast against his darker blue and red suit, painfully obvious\u2014to the style makes Peter want to rip the thing off and set it on fire.\nPeter, sitting slumped where\u2019s hidden himself away in a building\u2019s high up alcove, picks at the restricting collar.\nIn the distance, red and blue lights flare to life, sirens blaring into the night. The thought of going out in the jacket makes embarrassment flame in his cheeks.\nPeter deals with a ridiculous amount of embarrassment as Spider-Man. He\u2019s overheard Flash and his classmates, even random admirers on the street, talk about how cool it must be to be Spider-Man, how awesome he is, how much respect and awe Spider-Man must garner from those he encounters. Ha ha.\nThe sirens grow louder as more police cars join the procession. The situation must be growing dire.\nPeter takes a deep breath, and stands. He\u2019s a hero, he reminds himself. Embarrassed or not, crappy passed Act or not.\nHis feet leave the building\u2019s edge, and Peter is thrown into free fall, easily swinging past skyscrapers and over traffic.\nHe can do this, jacket or not.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe follows the progression of police cars to a bank robbery, which he takes down in a record time, barely seen as he flits about in the shadows, webbing the robbers from a distance rather than dropping down and engaging them.\nHe feels accomplished afterward, and stops three almost-muggings on his way back through the city. An aborted car accident, another mugging, and an hour later, and Peter feels as though nothing has happened.\nBy the time Peter hears about the super-villain further in the city, Peter has entirely forgotten about the jacket.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cTimes Square?\u201d Peter says to himself. \u201cAre you KIDDING ME?\u201d\nSuper-villains, with their stupid egos; they always want to be the centre of attention. It\u2019s a Saturday Night, and Times Square is crawling with people.\nThe NYPD are losing, badly, by the time Peter arrives. The super-villain of the night has flying robots\u2014wow, so inventive\u2014that appear imperative to bullets, impossible for the cops to fight. The cops dive for safety behind upturned vehicles. Peter swings closer, sticking to the shadows as he approaches.\n\u201cAny Supers sighted?\u201d a police officer says into his comms. His dark hair is balding, the dark cycles under his eyes telling tales of nights spent working through to dawn.\n\u201cNo,\u201d a tinny voice crackles out of the comm. \u201cNo Supers spotted.\u201d\nThe villain jumps into the air on rocket boots (okay, fine, Peter\u2019ll admit it; he\u2019s a little impressed and very jealous) and laughs manically, firing a round of bullets at the police, who hunch closer to the ground, curling in on themselves.\n\u201cNo Spider-Man?\u201d the officer asks, practically begs. He does not sound like Jameson, or any other annoyed reporters, or like a thousand cops before him who had taken one look at Spider-Man and tried to pepper him with bullets. He sounds beseeching, like he hopes the answer will be yes.\n\u201cNo,\u201d someone on the comm replies sadly.\n\u201cFuck,\u201d the cop whispers.\nThe villain explodes a part of the pavement and sends pedestrians running and screaming. The cop tries to stand, but the moment he tries, the villain subdues him with warning shots.\nThe officer has no choice but to flinch back for cover. He leans his forehead against the body of his gun, and murmurs again, with feeling, \u201cFuck.\u201d\nPeter creeps even closer, skidding off the awning and swinging upside down beside the car the cop is crouching behind.\n\u201cYou should watch your language,\u201d Peter says idly.\nThe other man starts, head swivelling up to look at the masked hero. His eyes go wide, and a smile begins to bloom on his lips. His shoulders relax, just a little.\nPeter sticks out a hand. \u201cI\u2019m your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man, and I\u2019ll be your designated hero for tonight.\u201d\nThe cop laughs, taking Peter\u2019s hand and shaking it as he says, \u201cI\u2019m Jeff, and I know who you are, bug boy. We were wondering if you\u2019d show.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Peter says, flipping to his feet and stretching lazily, \u201ccan\u2019t disappoint my adoring fans, now can I?\u201d\nOn the street, the villain continues to spew chaos, ignorant to Peter\u2019s arrival. The pavement is torn up, several cars reduced to husks of burnt and warped metal, but there are no bodies yet. The villain seems to be growing cocky though, and he is moving steadily closer to the curious civilians watching on the far side of the square.\nA little girl screams as a jet of fire whirls barely a metre to her left, and Peter jumps to his feet. The cops on the police radio are swearing up a panicked storm.\n\u201cGotta go,\u201d Peter says quickly. \u201cDuty calls.\u201d\nHe leaps over the car and swings closer. Behind him, Peter can hear the elated calls of \u201cSpider-Man!\u201d Several cops whoop victoriously, and his super-hearing lets him hear the rest\u2019s relieved exhales, the soft murmurs of, \u201cthank god.\u201d\n\u201cHey, douche-baguette!\u201d Peter shouts. The villain freezes, turns to him, and scowls. \u201cTry picking on someone your own size, huh?\u201d He leaps, flips, and lands closer, web shooters pointed at the prick\u2019s face. \u201cLike yours truly!\u201d\nHe webs the villain\u2019s face and the joints of the rocket boots, and the villain splutters in midair before being sent craning down, colliding painfully with the ground. His hands race to his face to try and tear the sticky stuff off, but his fingers just tangle in the long strands.\n\u201cGoing to give up, bud?\u201d Peter asks casually. The villain trips over his own feet, sprawling over the pavement. \u201cCome on, man, this is just embarrassing. Quit while your\u2026 well, not ahead, but not completely humiliated yet.\u201d\nThe villain scrambles back up, and pants roughly. His eyes flit around the square, surveying his webbed robots, the police officers that are moving out from their protected hunches, moving to help the frightened pedestrians. He looks up at the undamaged big screens, where his face is blown up to massive proportions. Most screens seem to be centred on Spider-Man, though. Specifically, his torso.\nThe on-lookers point and stare, caught between awe and shock, and something like concern.\nHis Spider-senses tingles. He\u2019s on red alert as the villain doubles over laughing.\n\u201cThat\u2019s rich!\u201d the bastard says. \u201cOh\u2014 Oh, my god. You\u2014Ha!\u201d\nPeter shifts his weight, looking around frantically for any sign of danger. There is none. Peter is not reassured.\n\u201cUm,\u201d Peter begins. \u201cYou alright there, pal? You need a drink of a water? A blankey?\u201d\nThe villain smirks. Villains are always doing that; smirking. Is there some kind of super-villain handbook? How to Look Pompous and Evil 101? Chapter 1: Smirking and Slicking Hair Back. Chapter 2: Leather Pants and British Accents.\n\u201cWhat about you, Spider-kid? Need a juice box?\u201d Smirky-Smirk-face says.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Spider-Man,\u201d Peter snipes back, like he always does when someone questions his age, or hears his teenage voice crack.\nThe villain\u2019s smirk grows even more pompous. \u201cEvidently not,\u201d he says.\nPeter blinks at the guy. Now that the villain is still, silent, Peter focusses on the pedestrians, on their whispering and pointing. At him. At his baby blue jacket, in the middle of Times Square, blown up to epic proportions on the huge towering screens.\nOh.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Peter says, dumbly. \u201cOh no.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Mr Conceited Prick says.\nHe turns and laughs at the crowd, opening his mouth to say something witty and insulting. Peter tackles him before he can get the words out.\n\u201cI\u2019m old enough to beat you,\u201d Peter says. He webs the other\u2019s mouth shut before he can respond, then webs his arms together, his thighs, his legs, and jumps back to survey his work.\n\u201cSpidey!\u201d\nThat\u2019s the cops, calling to him as they rush over. Their guns aren\u2019t pointed at him, and no one is asking him to put his \u201cfucking arms in the air or else!\u201d He\u2019s faced that dozens of times before, back when he was just starting out, and he\u2019d rather not deal with it again.\n\u201cSpidey\u2014\u201c There\u2019s the officer from before, Jeff, pushing past his colleagues and rushing toward him. \u201cI just realised\u2014your jacket, it means\u2026 Spidey, you aren\u2019t\u2026 are you\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cA competent hero? The awesomest spider this side of New York? Very much hoping you aren\u2019t going to try and arrest me? All of the above.\u201d\nJeff blinks at him. He\u2019s an inch or two shorter than Peter, but he is stockier and appears far older. He looks like a good man, Peter thinks.\n\u201cArrest you\u2026 No, no!\u201d Jeff shakes his head fervently. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t do that anymore, we\u2019re supposed to help you out when we can. We had a meeting about you and everything, it\u2019s all good.\u201d\nPeter blinks down at the other blankly\u2014the NYPD had a meeting about him, about not shooting him, about helping him. Holy cannoli.\nThe other officers hover several metres away, some clearing rubble from cars, others talking to pedestrians or into radios. Four are in the process of arresting Mr Villianous Ass over to Peter\u2019s right.\nNone of them are shouting or glaring at him. Their hands do not even hover over their guns, or ghost over the trigger as though itching to shoot themselves a spider. A blond cop sees him staring and smiles.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Peter says.\nHe hopes his sincerity is obvious. The other man waves the gratitude away with one airy hand.\n\u201cNo problem,\u201d the cop says casually. \u201cBut\u2026 Your jacket.\u201d\n\u201cYou like?\u201d Peter jokes. He twirls in a circle, holding his hands daintily to his chest. \u201cPretty, right? Got it from the cutest little boutique\u2014\u201c\n\u201cSpidey,\u201d the cop says. \u201cKid.\u201d\nPeter sighs, lets his hands drops to his sides. He doesn\u2019t try to run. He knows that will achieve nothing.\n\u201cLook,\u201d Jeff says, \u201cI was talking to some of the others, and we\u2019re worried. You\u2019re a good person, you\u2019ve saved so many, but this is dangerous\u2014\u201d\nPeter snorts a laugh. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t need to be out here if it wasn\u2019t so dangerous. I climb walls and swing off buildings. I can lift cars. I think I\u2019ll be right.\u201d\nThe cop narrows his eyes, and Peter realises how arrogant he sounds. He shakes his head and adds quickly, \u201cNot\u2014not that I think I\u2019m invincible! I don\u2019t! Trust me, I don\u2019t, I\u2019ve been shot so many times, and bleeding out in spandex in back alleyways gives you a better understanding of how not invincible you are, trust me\u2014\u201c\nHe\u2019s rambling and the cop is still staring, but the jacket\u2019s collar is tight against his throat, a reminder that an aspect of his identity has been permanently outed. Peter rambles when he panics, okay? It\u2019s a thing.\n\u201c\u2014annnnnd I\u2019m making things worse by telling you about all the times I was mortally wounded, BUT the moral of this story is that I\u2019m capable of looking after myself. And New York. I\u2019m not defenceless. I know what I\u2019m doing. Mostly. I mostly know what I\u2019m doing. Thank you for the concern, but, er. It\u2019s not needed, Mr\u2014um.\u201d\nHe almost adds \u2018Mr Police Officer, Sir\u2019 on the end, but decides against it. That would not make him sound more grown up.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need for that,\u201d the other man corrects. \u201cIt\u2019s still Jeff.\u201d\n\u201cYour concern is not needed,\u201d Peter repeats. \u201cJeff.\u201d\nJeff sighs heavily and rakes a hand through his hair.\n\u201cKid,\u201d he says. \u201cI know how capable you are, but\u2026 we\u2019re all kind of shocked. I didn\u2019t even realise what the jacket meant until someone told me a few minutes ago. Lots of the guys at the station\u2026 We\u2019re indebted to you, Spidey. Half of New York is. You\u2019re our hero, and we worry about you.\u201d\nPeter wants to say something like, \u2019N'awwwwwww, you do care!\u2019\nOr: \u2018Baby, you know I love you, too!\u2019\nInstead, he nods, solemnly. 12 months ago, when he was less renown and still fumbling through the basics of superhero-ing, he was used to people throwing trash at him and shouting threats. The police\u2019s \u2018shoot on sight\u2019 method had resulted in more than one unlucky incidents, where Peter had had to sit in class the next day, biting his lip, pretending not to be suffering through the agonising process of healing. Doing calculus was a lot harder with bullet holes in your thighs.\nNow, though, actual real life police officers are telling him they cared. Just\u2014Wow.\n\u201cBe careful, alright?\u201d Jeff adds.\n\u201cNo promises,\u201d Peter says.\nPeter steps away as he notices more police officers heading their way, looking prompt, like they mean business. Legal waffle, questioning; Peter likes to avoid it.\nHe leaps onto a car\u2019s roof, using it as a step to jump into the air and swing down the street.\nJeff smiles ruefully to himself.\n\u201cDammit, we needed to ask him a few questions,\u201d a cop says as she approaches. She notices his little smile, and asks, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cSpider-Man,\u201d Jeff says quietly. She stares, confused, as Jeff laughs softly, smiling to himself.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPeter uses Aunt May\u2019s kitchen knife to destroy the jacket. He pulls at the seams, using the blade to rip the blue atrocity in half. Afterward, he enthusiastically slam dunks the destroyed material in the bin.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOn Monday, the usual suspects are abuzz with gossip.\nPeter, head down, fumbling with his Modern History textbook and his notes on 20th century Russia, overhears Flash Thompson several lockers over. The blond is waving something in the air, and talking animatedly with a growing crowd of people.\n\u201cLook!\u201d Flash says, pointing at the paper in his hands. \u201cLook at this! You know what this jacket means?!\u201d\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d a girl in the year below them says.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d the boy next to her asks. \u201cWhat am I missing?\u201d\nFlash positively beams, and says, loudly, \u201cSpidey is our age!\u201d\nPeter hunches his shoulders, wanting to disappear. For once, he wishes someone would come and push him into his locker, so long as they shut the door behind him.\n\u201cWoaaahhhhh,\u201d someone in the crowd says. Flash may be popular (and mean and pompous, ugh), but when it comes to Spidey Talk, he\u2019ll talk to anyone. A cluster of people huddle around Flash at the moment. There are a distressingly large number of them. All of them are, Peter suspects, other dedicated Spider-Man fans.\nTo be fair, most of the school are huge Spider-Man fans. Peter is very, very embarrassed about this fact.\n\u201cSpidey is too cool,\u201d a shorter girl says, sceptic. (Peter chokes on a laugh\u2014him? Cool?) \u201cYou really think a high schooler could be that cool?\u201d\n\u201cDude\u2019s taken bullets, lifted cars,\u201d a footballer agrees. \u201cHe\u2019s a hero. You think someone like that can\u2019t even legally drink?\u201d\nFlash scoffs. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing about Spider-Man, though. He\u2019s the underdog! He\u2019s a hero who defies all expectations and kicks butt! He\u2019s the kind of guy who\u2019d say \u2018fuck the dangers\u2019 and \u2018fuck the consequences\u2019 and go out save people, because saving people is more important than doing homework. So, yeah. Teenage Spidey all the way.\u201d\nPeter literally tries to shove his entire head into his locker, his cheeks flushing red. Praise is a foreign concept to him, both in the suit and out of it.\nThe group breaks out into noisy chatter. Some are arguing against, talking about how it\u2019d be too hard to be a Super while still going to high school. It\u2019d be hard to hide it from parents and teachers because come on, someone would notice if a guy was coming to school with gunshot wounds and marks all up their face from being slammed by super-villains.\u00a0It\u2019s more likely a hoax, or photoshop.\nBut Flash has a fair few number of supporters who are arguing for Spider-Teen, saying how it makes sense, how much cooler and more relatable it makes the hero.\nThe first bell rings, and the crowd disperses, still chattering as they walk away.\nPeter is frozen, hands crumpled around his messy notes, eyes wide and ears red. He does not move until the hallways are almost empty, and then, slowly and cautiously, he wanders over to Flash\u2019s locker.\nThere, left crumbled on the ground, is a newspaper. A photograph of Spider-Man takes up the front page. In the photo, he\u2019s crouched low, mid-fight with the mediocre villain Peter had nabbed in the middle of Times Square. The baby blue jacket stands out against the darker red-and-navy suit.\nThe headline reads: SPIDER-MAN OR SPIDER-KID?\n\u201cOh no,\u201d Peter says.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPeter refuses to look at the newspapers after that.\nHe refuses to look online, and pretends not to hear Jameson on the big screen around New York, shouting, \u2019teenagers!\u2019 and \u2018I knew it! High school menace!\u2019 and \u2018send the bug to juvie!\u2019\nNo. Nope, he certainly hears nothing of the kind.\nDenial, thy name is Peter.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe next time Peter sees police officers, it\u2019s after he\u2019s stopped a bank robbery.\nIt had seemed so simple at first. Nothing out of the ordinary, just a couple of criminals Peter could take down one handed.\nAnd then the criminals had pulled out machine guns, seemingly out of no where. Not even Peter\u2019s Spidey senses and his superhuman reflexes could save him and the large group of hostages from that many bullets.\nFive causalities\u2014five people who wouldn\u2019t be returning to their families tonight, one of them a twelve year old kid.\nPeter had bodily taken three bullets when the leader had pointed a gun on a six year old boy, and he\u2019d panicked and jumped in front of the nozzle.\nPeter manages to survive, somehow, and webs the criminals up. Before he can make his retreat, the cops arrive. Peter\u2019s relieved, largely because the hysterical hostages calm down some, reassured at seeing the boys in blue.\n\u201c\u2018Afternoon,\u201d Peter says when the first group of officers burst in. The greeting sounds dull. Peter can\u2019t muster up the joking energy he usually saves for emergency services first arriving on the scene. He gestures to the far wall, where the four bank robbers are webbed together. \u201cCriminals that\u2019a way.\u201d\nThe first cop nods, heading toward the bank robbers, but the second hesitates, eyeing Peter carefully. Peter tiredly waves him away, pointing at hostages, tears still wet on their faces, blood still thick on the ground. \u201cHostages, that\u2019a way.\u201d\nThe cop nods and disappears behind the bank\u2019s counter where several people are huddled, traumatised. Peter rubs at his thigh, where a bullet is buried beneath layers of web and skin.\nPeter\u2019s going to get out of here in a minute. He\u2019s going to get up from his leant position against the wall, and walk out those doors with only the barest hints of a limp, and then swing home. He will\u2026 just as soon as he finds the energy.\n\u201cSpidey?\u201d Peter looks up. A cop with dark skin and soft eyes approaches him slowly, hands spread non-threatening in front of her. \u201cHey, bud. How hurt are you?\u201d\n\u201cNot hurt,\u201d Peter lies.\nTwo other cops jog over, hovering behind the soft-eyed police woman, glancing from her to the half-crouched vigilante. He\u2019s long since destroyed the Regulation Jacket, but their eyes still trace him, searching up and down his suit. Whatever they see make them purse their lips, eyes crinkling with worry.\n\u201cSpidey!\u201d A familiar figure runs into the complex, spotting him immediately. The man heads over, ignoring his three colleagues and coming to brace an arm around Peter\u2019s shoulders. \u201cHey there, remember me?\u201d\n\u201cJeff,\u201d Peter breathes.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Jeff says. He supports Peter, guiding him away from the wall and toward the bank\u2019s glass-doored exit. The three officers gape at them, the soft-eyed cop staring at Spidey, hands clenching into worried fists. \nPeter ducks his head, embarrassed, and Jeff snaps, \u201cDon\u2019t you all have jobs to do?\u201d\nTwo of them scurry away to assist their colleagues, but the first one doesn\u2019t move, gentle brown eyes focussed on Peter. \u201cYou going to be okay?\u201d she asks.\nPeter glances at Jeff. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says, and this time, he isn\u2019t entirely lying.\nThe woman nods, and leaves, heading toward a distraught hostage struggling to breathe through their tears. Jeff sighs, and says, \u201cC\u2019mon, Spidey.\u201d\nJeff helps Peter limp toward a pair of paramedics. Jeff waits with him as they do their best to cut away his webs, dig out the bullets, and stitch him back up. Peter refuses to go to a hospital. Jeff refuses to leave the younger man\u2019s side.\nNothing anyone can do could help Peter forget the image of the preteen, mouth open in horror, skin ashen in death, blood pooling onto the bank floor. Still, Peter feels a little better. Jeff\u2019s hand on his shoulder, a pair of steady hands cleaning up his wounds; Peter feels like he can breathe.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPedestrians slow when they pass the hot dog van. Some of them pause briefly, just long enough to see what\u2019s drawn so many New Yorkers\u2019 gaze, before huffing angrily and stomping away, muttering to themselves about menaces and damned Supers. Others smile when they see the costumed figure, or point and whisper excitedly to one another.\nThe owner of said hot dog van smiles to himself. He ignores the crowd, the stares, the pair of red and blue legs swinging over the side of his van\u2019s roof, and continues making hot dogs.\n\u201cMustard this time?\u201d he questions.\n\u201cOf course!\u201d Spider-Man says, offended the man had to ask. \u201cWhat is a \u2018dog without mustard, honestly! You\u2019re supposed to be the hot dog professional here, seriously, where did you get your hot dog degree, good sir\u2014\u201c\n\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d the man says, smiling and holding the hot dog into the air above him. \u201cTake the damn thing before I give it to a paying customer.\u201d\nThere is a superhuman flash of limbs and his hand is empty, the food gone. An upside-down Spider-Man smiles closed-mouthed at him, mask pulled up to his nose, mustard smearing his cheek.\nSpider-Man swallows and beams. \u201cThanks, Stan!\u201d he says, before disappearing from sight.\nStan knows the vigilante is lazing upon his roof now, using it like his personal sofa. He does it often enough.\nSeveral months ago, Spider-Man had saved Stan and his van from being flattened by an out-of-control truck. Stan saw the Super two weeks later, when he\u2019d fallen hard upon the pavement mid-swing, his hands bloody, his breathing ragged.\nStan had helped the guy up, like any descent person would. He hadn\u2019t called an ambulance, though he could see the difficulty Spider-Man was having breathing. He hadn\u2019t called the police, or the Bugle, or said anything about an autograph.\nInstead, Stan had offered him a hotdog.\n\u201cYou look hungry,\u201d Stan had said.\n\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t have any money\u2026\u201d Spidey replied weakly.\nStan had patted the guy on the back, and smiled.\n\u201cFor you?\u201d Stan said. \u201cOn the house. A free hot dog, whenever you want.\u201d\nSince then, Spider-Man had been by once a month. Once a month turned into once a fortnight, then every other a week. Now, Stan feels concerned when he doesn\u2019t see the hero sitting on his van at least once a week.\nIt helps that the bug was good for business. A few pictures of Spidey sitting astride his van had even made it into the papers.\nFive minutes pass in companionable silence. Stan sells hotdogs\u2014he always sells twice the usual amount when Spidey\u2019s sitting on his van\u2014and the costumed hero takes deep breaths and heals from whatever beating he\u2019d taken earlier, recharging his mental batteries.\n\u201cUm.\u201d A college-aged boy approaches cautiously. An Avengers shirt is stretched over the broad expanse of his chest, a jean jacket covered in pins looped over his arm.\n\u201cHere to buy something?\u201d Stan asks bluntly. He can see the way the boy\u2019s eyes flit to the hero nervously, and Stan\u2019ll be damned if he lets someone bug Spidey when he\u2019s resting. The masked kid trusts him, has become something like a friend. Stan knows how much nosiness freaks Spidey out.\n\u201cNo, erm. Sir, are you aware Spider-Man is sitting on your roof?\u201d\nStan stares down at the other man.\n\u201cSpider-Man?!\u201d Spidey interjects, his voice pitched jokingly high. \u201cWhat?! Where?\u201d\n\u201cHa, ha,\u201d Stan says flatly. \u201cYou\u2019re hilarious.\u201d\n\u201cI like to think so, yes.\u201d\n\u201cOh, my god,\u201d the boy whispers to himself, jaw hanging low as he stares, awed.\n\u201cHiya,\u201d Spidey says. The hero\u2019s scooted to the edge of the van, his legs hanging over the side again. \u201cCan I\u2026 help you?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I just\u2026 You\u2019re Spider-Man.\u201d\n\u201cI am?!\u201d Spidey says, faux alarm in his voice. He glances down at his spandex-clad chest and lets out a little shriek. \u201cOh my god! How long? I never knewwww!\u201d\n\u201cSpidey,\u201d Stan admonishes gently.\n\u201cHa, sorry, man. I just get that a lot\u2014\u201c Spidey cuts off mid-sentence. He shuffles even closer and leans down to peer at the college kid, as though only just seeing him for the first time. \u201cHey, nice badges!\u201d\nThe kid\u2014baby-faced, but likely older than Spidey, Stan thinks\u2014starts, looking down at his jean jacket. He would be holding up the line, but at this point, people are standing away, too surprised to see Spider-Man talking to two random New Yorkers to even think about venturing closer or buying a hot dog.\n\u201cOh,\u201d the boy says, \u201cthanks!\u201d\nThe boy unfolds the jacket and lifts it into the air so Spidey can see the badges properly. The masked man lets out a delighted \u2018ooh!\u2019 sound. He points at four of them\u2014a captain american pin, two mutant rights pins, and one anti-Underage Superhuman Act pin.\n\u201cI really like these,\u201d Spidey says. The kid shifts his hold on the jacket, and Spidey coos as he spots a red and blue webbed pin. \u201cIs that a Spider-Man badge? Dude!\u201d\nThe boy blushes. \u201cSorry, that must be weird, I just\u2014\u201c\n\u201cNo, no! I like it, it\u2019s cool.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2026 you really think so?\u201d\nSpidey nods earnestly, and the kid beams.\n\u201cWell, then,\u201d the boy says as he unpins the badges Spidey had pointed to. \u201cHere. You can have them.\u201d\nSpidey squawks and jumps back. \u201cI can\u2019t take your things! Just\u2014direct me to the site or the store you bought them from, and I\u2019ll buy them myself!\u201d\nStan huffs a laugh. \u201cYou can\u2019t afford hot dogs most days,\u201d he points out.\n\u201cI\u2014er,\u201d Spidey begins. He falters, looking lost; Stan knows just how broke the guy is, has heard the dramatic whining sounds he makes whenever the subject of his bank account is brought up. \u201cWell\u2026 You refused whenever I tried to pay you for \u2018em!\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Stan says, \u201cbut you stopped offering because you don\u2019t have enough money to pretend. Nice try, Spidey.\u201d\nSpider-Man makes sad sounds\u2014there they are, the sad \u2018I\u2019m so brokkkkkkkke!\u2019 noises\u2014and Stan laughs softly to himself.\nThe kid moves forward and grabs hold of Spidey\u2019s gloved hand. He manually opens it palm up, pushing the badges into his hand.\n\u201cTake them,\u201d the kid insists. \u201cReally.\u201d\n\u201cAre you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d\nSpidey is silent for a long moment. He shakes his head, before putting the pins safely in a hidden pocket around his waist.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Spidey says. His voice is thick with sincerity and gratitude over four meagre badges.\nSpidey, still perched on the roof of Stan\u2019s van, leant forward over the edge to talk to the both of them, stiffens suddenly. The hero immediately looks to all the pedestrians nearby\u2014now starting to go about their busy lives, now that it\u2019s evident nothing overly exciting is going to happen.\n\u201cSpidey-sense\u2026?\u201d Spider-Man murmurs to himself, rubbing at his temple. \u201cThere\u2019s no danger, what the heck is up\u2014OOF!\u201d\nAnd Spidey goes flying off Stan\u2019s roof in a blur of red and flashy gold, spandex limbs tangled in iron ones.\nThe college kid stares off after them, mouth agape.\n\u201cWas that\u2026 was that Iron Man?!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIron Man finally stops several streets away, atop a relatively secluded rooftop, and Peter disentangles from the older hero.\nPeter already knows what this is about; he\u2019s been expecting something like this for a while now. He\u2019s heard about lots of the older Supers personally enforcing the Regulation Jackets. Peter steels himself, ready for a fight.\nStark grabs him around the shoulder and thrusts a wad of blue fabric into Peter\u2019s chest. Peter lets it drop to the floor.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Peter says. \u201cNo, nope, nada. Not this time.\u201d\n\u201cYou have to,\u201d Iron Man tells him, firmly.\n\u201cDo I have to say it in spanish? No.\u201d\nPeter tries to run, jump off the building and swing away, only to have repulsers blasted warningly near him. He tries a second time and steel arm wraps around his throat, prohibiting him from making a hasty get away.\n\u201cYou have to wear it,\u201d Tony keeps saying. \u201cC\u2019mon, kid, we\u2019ve been through this.\u201d\nIron Man\u2019s faceplate is cold, expressionless, and Peter refuses to admit how intimated he is (Iron Man! An Avenger! Peter may be angry, but even the sudden realisation that his longtime idol is actually kind of a huge dick can\u2019t quell that tiny part within him that\u2019s star-struck).\n\u201cThat\u2014that right there is why I refuse to!\u201d Peter says. \u201cI\u2019m a superhero, alright? Kind of hard to be symbol of hope when everyone keeps calling me \u2018kid.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the law.\u201d\n\u201cTHE LAW CAN SUCK A DICK!\u201d\nPeter flails in Stark\u2019s grip. When Stark flips his faceplate up, Peter manages to elbow him in the nose before backflipping and sprinting across the roof. He\u2019s halfway to freedom, when he hears Stark say into his comm: \u201cAlright, hawk-brain. Your turn.\u201d\nAn arrow lodges in his leg, and Peter goes down hard.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe jacket is itchy and ugly and Peter HATES IT.\nHe\u2019s nursing a sore leg and an even sorer grudge. The arrow that had buried in his thigh was small, barely thicker than one of his thin fingers, but it had hurt.\nPeter doesn\u2019t care about whatever guilt the two Avengers are harbouring, or whatever happened to them to make them so damn protective of teenagers who throw themselves in front of bullets, because seriously. How dare they try and meddle in his life.\nPeter shreds the jacket with vengeance as soon as he gets home. He refuses to wear that thing again. The first time had been humiliating enough.\nWill the older Supers come after him again? Yes. Does Peter care? Okay, also yes, but the jacket must DIE.\nThis time, instead of throwing the tatters of the ruined jacket in the rubbish, he lights the fireplace in his living room and burns it.\nAunt May comes home to find him laughing, crazed, over an alarmingly large fire. Peter rubs his hands together, staring deep into the flames as something pops and crackles as it melts.\n\u201cBurn,\u201d Peter murmurs to himself, voice high and vaguely hysterical. \u201cYes, burn, burn!\u201d\nAunt May tiptoes away from the living room.\nTeenagers, she thinks, shaking her head.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey pin him again the next day. Stark throws another jacket at his head. Peter brushes it away, letting it fall to the ground.\n\u201cYou stubborn shit,\u201d Stark shouts, picking the jacket back up and shoving it into Peter\u2019s arms. \u201cWear it. I\u2019m not fucking around.\u201d\nPeter lifts his mask to his nose and sticks his tongue out at the older Super. Tony throws his hands in the air and activates his boots, rocketing away, disappearing into the skyline.\nOn the way home, Peter drops the jacket into the sewer.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey call in Deadpool. THEY CALL IN DEADPOOL. Deadpool isn't even supposed to be allowed in New York, good lord.\n\u201cActually, no one called me,\u201d Deadpool says when Peter screams this into his hands. \u201cVolunteered for this all by myself, Spidey!\u201d\n\u201cWhy,\u201d Peter moans, words muffled by his hands and mask. He feels bullied.\n\u201cTo make sure our li\u2019l spider was eating his greens! You been drinking enough milk, kiddo? Have any homework you need ol\u2019 Deadpool to help you with? Actually, scratch that, I hate homework, used to set it on fire or make paper planes out of it, or used it to make paper planes that caught fire when they flew, ooh can we do that\u2014?\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you care about this stupid law?\u201d Peter interrupts. \u201cWho cares about some dumb jacket? Why should you care that I\u2019m a high schooler?\u201d\nThe anti-hero sobers, shoulders straightening in a worrying way.\nAll of Wilson\u2019s behaviour today has been worrying. The merc isn\u2019t bouncing forward to sling an arm over Peter\u2019s shoulders, cuddling up close, or slipping an arm around his waist and groping Peter\u2019s ass, like Deadpool often does. There was no wolf-whistling when Peter had first swung past, no shouts of \u2018Spidey-babe! Sweet cheeks!\u2019 Nothing lewd, nothing alluding to Wade\u2019s dick and what he wants Peter to do with it. Unusual.\n\u201cSpidey,\u201d Deadpool says. \u201cI thought you were an adult. Okay, not a very old one, but you know, at least 22, 23, not some fucking high schooler, fuck\u2026\u201d\nPeter remains unimpressed, if not a little unnerved by Deadpool\u2019s relatively serious tone. \u201cSo?\u201d\n\u201cSo? So? So, I\u2019ve been working my \u00a0game on you!\u201d Deadpool gestures between them. \u201cI\u2019ve been flirting up a storm! I seduced a higher schooler!\u201d\n\u201cYou did not seduce me,\u201d Peter says, deadpan.\nDeadpool continues as though Peter had never spoken; \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to get into the pants of a kid. I\u2019ve literally tried to shove my hand into your pants several times.\u201d Deadpool had succeeded, too, once or twice. Peter feels red hot with embarrassment. Despite the red and black suit firmly in place, Peter can see how sickened the merc is. \u201cI\u2019m a creep, sure, but I\u2019m not a pedophile\u2014\u201c\n\u201cI never thought you were,\u201d Peter says quickly, because c\u2019mon, he\u2019s sixteen, not six. \u201cI\u2019m almost an adult\u2014\u201c\n\u201cYou\u2019re a teenager!\u201d\n\u201cWho cares?\u201d\n\u201cWho cares\u2014? Spidey!\u201d Deadpool moves forward, closer, puts both of his hands on Peter\u2019s shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m an adult, I should\u2019ve\u2014ugh, I\u2019m not good with this. There\u2019s, like, moral ambiguity\u2014yes, I know, I sound smart as fuck with my big-ass fancy words\u2014about teenagers and their\u2014their ability to consent. Adults\u2014\u201d Deadpool gestured at himself, and then at the rest of the city, where other heroes and villains and civilians slept, \u201c\u2014do shit to heroes. I\u2019ve seen it Spidey, the way ungrateful people act when you save them. Sometimes they swear or shout death things or shout sex things, and.\u201d Deadpool clenches his fists angrily. \u201cAnd you\u2019re a fucking kid.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not a child\u2014!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a fucking high schooler!\u201d\nPeter lets out a frustrated groan. Here Deadpool was, finally acting like an adult for once, and he does it to gang up on Peter.\n\u201cWhat is it with everyone thinking they know better than me?! I can\u2019t drive, so freakin\u2019 what? You know what I can do? Save people. Lift cars. Make a difference.\u201d\n\u201cNo one\u2019s saying that you can\u2019t, Spidey.\u201d Baby blue fabric is thrown at him\u2014and come on, how many of these ugly jackets does the city have?\u2014and Peter catches it instinctively. \u201cIf you were against a stranger in a suit, and you had orders to take them out by Fury, or torture them for info, would you still do it if you knew the target was actually a 13 year old?\u201d\nLectured on morals by Deadpool. Peter would be proud of his friend if he wasn't so frustrated, didn\u2019t feel a tiny sting of betrayal, didn\u2019t feel a little bit honoured that the merc cared.\nStill, it was strange seeing Deadpool so serious. Peter had never seen him act even remotely like this before. Deadpool looked oddly passionate about this, about the rules of consent. There must be a story behind that.\n\u201cI\u2019m not 13,\u201d Peter says.\n\u201cWould you do it?\u201d Deadpool presses.\nPeter\u2019s hands are fisted in the folds of the jacket. He stares at it, willing it to catch fire.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Spidey admits, \u201cbut I don\u2019t kill or torture people as a general rule anyway so\u2014\u201d\n\u201cPut the damned jacket on, Spidey.\u201d\nThe jacket is pulled on over his webbed suit. This time, there are no insistent hands pushing him into it, no rough tugging from someone else, no one else to tighten the collar around his throat like a vice.\nThis time, Peter pulls the jacket on himself.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe goes out in the jacket.\nNothing really changes that first day. He swings around, still hears shouts from people as he passes them\u2014some awed, some angry\u2014and he still saves people. He almost managed to forget about the jacket entirely.\nThe next morning is a Tuesday. Peter munches on a bowl of cornflakes and honey, and watches Aunt May go about making herself a bowl of oats. The tiny television on the kitchen provides a soft drone of noise.\n\u201cOh!\u201d Aunt May says suddenly.\nPeter looks up sharply, limbs going tense, ready to spring up and fight at a moments notice.\nAunt May is only focussed on the TV. Peter relaxes, relieved, but then Aunt May flicks the volume up, and he stiffens and crushes the metal spoon in his hand in half.\n\u201cSpider-Man was spotted yesterday evening preventing a car accident. The masked hero was wearing a blue jacket, and our sources confirm it is the same Regulation Jacket assigned to underage superheroes in the wake the Super Nova\u2019s death several weeks ago.\u201c\nThe shot of the newsman cuts to shaky iPhone footage. It\u2019s him, Peter realises, Spider-him, using his webbing to pull a tiny Volkswagen and its passengers out of the path of an out-of-control truck. He pulls several frozen onlookers out of the way too, before darting forward and trying to web the truck to a stop.\nThe truck merely slows, not stopping, and Spider-Man bodily puts himself in front of it, hands out, feet firmly planted, to push the truck back. He stumbles a little, but manages to right himself in time, and slow the truck to halt before it could crash into the building full of people barely a metre away.\n\n\u201cSpider-Man appeared to sustain some damage from the impact\u2014\u201c\n\nThat had hurt, Peter remembers. He\u2019d grabbed the truck the wrong way, and the full weight had caught him around his upper body.\nThe newsman continues, \u201cThe jacket suggests that Spider-Man is under 18 years old, legally a child. The pedestrians we interviewed appeared alarmed at the idea of a teenager putting themselves in such a dangerous situations, and also being harmed due to\u2014\u201c\nAunt May\u2019s eyes are wide, both hands clasped against her mouth. Peter thinks for a moment she\u2019s worked out that Peter\u2019s Spider-Man, and the breath is stolen from his lungs.\n\u201cOh god,\u201d she whispers. \u201cThat poor boy.\u201d\nPeter relaxes, then he scoffs, saying, \u201cPoor? Aunt May, he\u2019s a Super.\u201d\n\u201cBut he\u2019s still a person. It must be so hard to deal with it, so much violence\u2026 I\u2019ve been an adult for a long, long time and it\u2019d frighten me too much to even move.\u201d\nPeter subtly bends his metal spoon back into shape beneath the table, and says, casually, \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s not that scary.\u201d\nAunt May cuffs him lightly round the ear. \u201cPeter, unless you\u2019re the one out there helping people, you should have some respect. Everyone should. Spider-Man is very brave.\u201d\nPeter takes a large bite of cornflakes to hide his smile. \u201cYeah?\u201d he asks with a full mouth.\nAunt May nods. \u201cHis parents must be so proud. I know I would just be bursting with it\u2014and oh! His poor parents. I can\u2019t imagine how hard that would be to see your child out there, in danger\u2026\u201d Aunt May picks up her bowl of oats and joins Peter at the table, leaning forward to ruffle Peter\u2019s hair lightly when she\u2019s in reach.\n\u201cThank goodness you have a nice, sensible hobby like photography,\u201d she tells him. Peter discreetly pretends he isn\u2019t choking on his breakfast.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPeter finds the pins he\u2019d received from the young New Yorker, the one with the jean jacket and the huge, awed eyes, outside of Stan\u2019s hotdog van.\n\u201cHuh,\u201d he says, staring at them appraisingly. He\u2019d forgotten all about them in wake of Tony Stark\u2019s abrupt arrival.\nHe thinks about what to do with them. Pin them on his satchel? Maybe. Stick them on his own jean jacket? Peter doesn\u2019t own a jean jacket. He only owns his beat up brown one, and the awful baby blue\u2014\nWait.\nIf I\u2019m going to wear it, Peter thinks, I might as well go all out\u2026\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPeter stops the Juggernaut on a Wednesday. It\u2019s a sunny afternoon, everything clear and visible in the middle of a crowded New York street. Peter is glad\u2014he makes sure to arch his back, puff out his chest a little, and stand still enough for people around him to catch a photo of him.\nIt\u2019s on the internet before Peter makes it home.\nHe finds one of the photos on twitter, with the caption: This is the most passive-aggressive thing I\u2019ve ever seen. Kudos, Spidey.\nThe photos\u2014Peter standing tall, chest out, gazing to the right where a webbed up Juggernaut struggles on the pavement\u2014shows off the pins Peter had stuck to his Regulation Jacket. The Anti-Superhuman Registration Act pin is the biggest and immediately catches the viewer\u2019s eye, surrounded by the two anti-Mutant Registration Act pins and the smaller Captain America one. Peter had almost left that one off, after the aggressiveness of Iron Man, his fellow Avenger, but Peter can\u2019t bring himself to.\n\u201cAh yes,\u201d Peter says to himself, stroking an imaginary beard on his chin, eyeing the increasing number of retweets\u2014well into the thousands, good lord\u2014with a satisfied smile. \u201cGood.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPeter is not shouted at as much.\nWell, no, that\u2019s not quite true. People still dislike Supers, some people always will. Jameson gets worse (spitting words like \u201cmenace\u201d and \u201cteenagers,\u201d like they leave a dirty taste on his tongue), but the general public stops throwing trash at him.\nMost of them.\nGenerally, the whole city had already gotten better before the Nova incident. Most of New York liked him, loved him even, but there was still a part of the population that felt inclined to throw soda cans and harsh words his way when they saw him in costume.\nNow days, Peter sees those people less. They still exist, but now, when they start shouting, aim themselves with projectiles, people in the vicinity shout back. It\u2019s\u2026 nice. Bewildering. A bewildering kind of nice.\nThe most obvious case of this is on a Tuesday afternoon, the sunlight thick and warm in the streets. Peter tends to stick to the air, swinging on his webs high above the cars, but today, he\u2019s ventured lower, and is glad for it when he sees a man about to be crushed by a falling steel beam.\nPeter tackles a construction worker out of the way, and they tumble into the street from the force. Peter is reaching down to help the man to his feet, an apology on his lips, when he hears it.\nA man, an angry Southern one, shouts from a yard over, \u201cHey, freak!\u201d\nPeter ignores him and hauls the construction worker to his feet.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d the man says breathlessly. \u201cCrap, shit. I was almost crushed\u2014thank you so much.\u201d\n\u201cTry to make those beams a little sturdier next time?\u201d Peter suggests with a laugh, patting the man on the shoulder, brushing off the dirt on the man\u2019s uniform.\n\u201cHEY, you! I\u2019m talking to you! Look at me when I\u2019m talking to you, you fucking freak!\u201d\nPeter sighs hugely, knowing the words are aimed at him. He wants to flip the man off, but wide eyed children skirt along the edges of his vision\u2014a pair of boys with matching, agape mouths, a little girl hiding behind her mother\u2019s dress, a toddler reaching for Peter\u2019s strange, brightly coloured costume from his mother\u2019s arms\u2014and bites down the urge.\n\u201cWhat a dick,\u201d the construction worker mumbles angrily under his breath. \u201cSome people, I swear. No respect.\u201d\nPeter shrugs. \u201cI get it a lot,\u201d he confesses. \u201cNew Yorkers, y\u2019know.\u201d\n\u201cGet the FUCK off my streets, you hear me? No one needs you fucking freaks in our city, attracting weird shit and\u2014and criminals.\u201d Peter sighs again, planning to say goodbye to the construction worker and beat a hasty retreat up into the skyline, but freezes as the man continues: \u201cIt\u2019s YOUR FAULT people keep dying. All those people those villains kill, and fucking car crashes and shit\u2014where were YOU, you goddamn\u2014!\u201d\nPeter\u2019s whole body has gone taunt, shoulders curling around his neck like they do when he\u2019s plain old Peter Parker, making himself smaller, trying to form a barrier, a shell, between him and the world.\nIt hurts, to hear the words that ring in his head throughout the day echoed back at him. This man\u2019s words, his insults. The truth. It hurts.\n\u201cHEY!\u201d The construction worker straightens up, a good 6 feet in height. His huge muscles, disguised by a beer belly, bulge as he curls his hands into fists. \u201cYou want to shut up, pal?!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s true!\u201d the shouter says. \u201cThis fucking\u2014\u201d\nHe\u2019s come closer, too close, outstretching a hand toward Peter as though to grab him and shake him, or tear into him more than his words already have.\nPeter tenses even more. He wants to run, take off like a skittish animal, but his boots are rooted to the ground, heartbeat pounding in his ears.\nThe man lunges forward, his fingers so close to Peter they brush against his back. Several things happen at once; the woman with an armful of toddler, shrieks at the man (\u201cHEY, STOP\u2014!\u201d), and the pair of casually dressed men to his right, previously chatting idly, jump into the scene when the shouter moves, catching Peter\u2019s would-be attacker by the scruff of his shirt. An older woman, around his Aunt\u2019s age, rushes over, spitting swear words over her conservative cashmere sweater and pearl necklace.\nThe construction worker has sidestepped in front of Peter, fists braced in front of him, a physical barrier between the teenager and the attacker.\n\u201cFuck off,\u201d the construction worker tells the man. \u201cYou hear me? Fuck off.\u201d\nThe mother presses her toddler\u2019s face into the crook of her neck, and hisses, \u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you? How dare you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou fucking\u2014\u201c the older woman says around a lipsticked grimace, looking about ready to clobber the man over the head with her handbag.\nThe man in a loose tie, holding the prick in a tight hold, shakes him and says, \u201cYou want to pick a fight, mate? Pick one with me.\u201d\nPeter\u2019s would-be attacker thrashes in his grip, and his friend helps him restrain the guy, gripping at him tight, anything but gentle.\nThe aggressive man bares his teeth, nodding his head at Peter. \u201cThe freak fucking deserves to take a goddamn beating, look at him\u2014\u201d\nThe people surrounding Peter, the tiny crowd who\u2019ve assigned themselves as his protectors, do not take kindly to this, leaping in with their own indignant shouts:\n\u201cHey, shut the FUCK UP\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhat the fuck, man\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou ignorant\u2014you have no idea what exactly\u2014\u201d\n\u201cErm,\u201d Peter says. Five New Yorkers are shouting at someone who attempted to hurt him, visibly bristling, throwing words and looking ready to throw fists. The man\u2019s words\u2014nothing Peter hasn\u2019t heard spat his way before, really\u2014are drowned beneath a sea of angry rebuttals, the shouts of people coming to Peter\u2019s defence.\nThey are a spectacle on the packed street. People hover around them, excited at the drama. Many of them hear their argument, work out what exactly the fuss is about, spot Peter clothed in spandex and confusion, and become agitated themselves, angry on his behalf.\n\u201cGuys,\u201d Peter tries. None of them hear him. \u201cGuys?\u201d\n\u201cHow ungrateful, trying to hurt someone who risks life and limb to protect this city and undeserving pricks like you!\u201d\n\u201cThe bitch doesn\u2019t do shit for this city, he ruins it, it\u2019s his fault New York is\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s a child, how could you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDude, it isn\u2019t his fault\u2014\u201c\nThe angry man kicks one of the men holding him in the shin\u2014who immediately clutches at it, howling\u2014and elbows the other in the face. The construction worker stalks closer, fists bared, and the attacking man draws his arm back to sock him in the face.\nPeter darts in-between them, just in time to catch the punch meant for the construction worker right in the mouth.\nPeter feels blood thicken his mouth, his lip splitting. There are immediate howls of protest from people around him, more people hurrying forward to do something. A bigger fight, a full on brawl waiting to happen. It suddenly occurs to Peter that getting hurt is the worst possible thing he could\u2019ve done in a situation full of protective New Yorkers.\n\nYou sure messed this up, Parker. Had to make it worse, didn\u2019t you?\n\nPeter grabs hold of his attacker before anyone else can, jumping into the air, leaping across the street with the protesting man in hand. Peter deposits him on the other side of the road. The guy\u2019s an asshole, but Peter isn\u2019t about to let him be beaten to death by a mob of angry New Yorkers.\n\u201cGet out of here,\u201d Peter tells him, as coherent as possible with a mouthful of blood.\n\u201cI don\u2019t need your help,\u201d the man spits. \u201cThis is your fault\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019ve said that enough in the last ten minutes. Now go, before the dozen or so angry people across the street come after you.\u201d\nThe man looks at him with unkind, beady eyes, a snarl caught on his lips, but sees the bristling mob behind Peter, the promise of violence still hanging in the air, and wisely scampers off.\nPeter swings over to the mob once the man is out of sight, landing in a crouch on top of a street pole rather than flat footed on the sidewalk. The group look up at him, halfway worried, halfway confused.\n\u201cSpidey,\u201d the construction worker begins, stepping forward.\n\u201cThanks for the save,\u201d Peter says.\n\u201cJust returning the favour,\u201d the construction worker says with a tired smile. \u201cYou okay?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter says honestly. His lip is swelling, but it will have healed within the hour, and the words the man had shouted at him have dimmed, slipped off him in the wake of these people\u2019s actions. He raises his voice to address the crowd; \u201cThanks for being my knights in shining armour, everyone. I, er. Actually appreciate that a lot.\u201d\nA few open their mouths, more shifting closer to him, but Peter stands and jumps into the air and leaves quickly.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cNew Yorkers,\u201d Peter pants out as he soon as he lands, \u201care crazy.\u201d\nStan doesn\u2019t even look up. He just nods as he gathers up another hotdog, squirting ketchup into a fresh bun. \u201cDon\u2019t need to tell me that, pal.\u201d\nPeter slumps against the van. Blood is no longer welling up in his mouth, but there\u2019s still a lingering sting and awful copper taste that makes him rub at his jaw, smack his lips together and wince.\n\u201cSeriously.\u201d Peter makes an aborted, frustrated gesture with one hand. \u201cJust\u2014why.\u201d\nStan looks up, spots the blood still wet along Peter\u2019s mask, and almost drops the hotdog he\u2019s holding. He reaches across the counter and touches Peter\u2019s jaw, looking horrified when his fingers come away red. \u201cSpidey! What happened? Are you okay?\n\u201cNot you too,\u201d Peter dismays. \u201cCan\u2019t a man go about his business in peace in this city?\u201d\nHe leans back, surveying Peter. \u201cYeah,\u201d Stan decides, \u201cyou\u2019re okay. What happened?\u201d\nPeter shrugs. He doesn\u2019t much feel like getting into it. \u201cJust\u2014just people. You know.\u201d\nStan nods seriously, pretending to understand, and pours mustard over the sausage. Peter is grateful; Stan, at least, treats him with some semblance of respect. He trusts Peter\u2019s judgement.\n\u201cYou\u2019d think after all the Supers in this city, New Yorkers would become desensitized to it all but no, they keep hurling abuse\u2014\u201d Stan shoves a hotdog into Peter\u2019s hand. Peter stares up at the vendor. \u201cI love you.\u201d\nStan rolls his eyes. \u201cCareful, don\u2019t let my wife hear.\u201d\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t people be as chilled as you, Stan?\u201d Peter asks around a full mouth.\nStan watches him with steady eyes and a cocked head, considering Peter calmly. \u201cEventually, people will understand. They will, if it\u2019s you. You\u2014you inspire something in people, Spidey.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Peter\u2019s jaw is covered in crumbs, smudged mustard decorating the curve of his jaw.\nStan laughs. \u201cShut up and eat your \u2018dog, kid.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDoctor Octopus is manic, deranged, hugely dangerous, but he\u2019s someone Peter\u2019s dealt with before. He knows Doctor Ock. He can handle him and his \u2018bots.\n\u201cGet out of here, kid,\u201d Tony Stark tells him when Peter lands in the middle of the battle. The older man has both repulsers up, shooting oncoming Octobots, and barely even turns to Peter to dismiss him. \u201cWe got this, run along home to mummy.\u201d\nPeter takes it in-stride; he\u2019s used to the teasing from other Supers, often dishes it out twice as bad as he gets.\n\u201cToo much for you, old man?\u201d Peter quips, webbing an approaching Octobot to the road. It writhes there, tentacles splayed out, and Tony shoots it dead. \u201cDon\u2019t want to be shown up by someone younger and more attractive than yourself?\u201d\n\u201cYou wish,\u201d Tony says.\n\u201cI get it, you have a Snow White complex! Yeah, you don\u2019t want someone younger to outshine you as the fairest in the land.\u201d Peter snickers to himself, as he runs along the roof of a car, backflips off the end, and lands on a bot, crushing it with his weight and force of his jump. \u201cN\u2019aw, are you insecure?\u201d\n\u201cNice jacket,\u201d Tony quips back. \u201cGlad to see you\u2019re following daddy\u2019s orders.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018Daddy\u2019, wow, kinky. Though, hey, can you even get it up, nowadays? Don\u2019t you older guys have to take special medication and shit? Not that I\u2019d know, of course.\u201d\nTony stares at him, or glares at him, or maybe just looks vaguely in his direction\u2014with the emotionless metal faceplate it\u2019s hard to tell. Still, it\u2019s unnerving, intimidating. Maybe Peter shouldn\u2019t mention the guy\u2019s dick? Maybe he really is getting insecure in his old age. Maybe Peter hit a nerve.\nTony activates his rocket boosters, and with an electronic whine and a burst of light, he rockets upward, so fast he\u2019s nothing but a blur of red and gold.\nPeter\u2019s ears are ringing, and he stares up, watching Tony disappear further into the city, fast as a bullet.\n\u201cShow off,\u201d Peter grumbles. He\u2019s secretly impressed.\nFive minutes and four destroyed Octobots later, and Tony is back, landing in the rubble in a heroic pose that certainly doesn\u2019t make Peter feel inadequate in his brightly coloured spandex. Nope. No insecurity here.\n\u201cHe\u2019s still here,\u201d Iron Man says, not to Peter. His comm, likely. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll talk to him, Cap\u2019.\u201d\nAnd then Iron Man is coming over, towards Peter, and his begins to heart races. Maybe this is it. What Peter\u2019s been dreaming of since he was 12 and first saw the group of superheroes on TV.\nHere it comes: I\u2019d like to talk to you about the Avengers Initiative. Would you consider joining?\nPeter Parker, Spider-Man, full time Avenger.\n\u201cHang up the mask,\u201d Tony says, and Peter\u2019s heart stumbles in his chest, breath frozen in his throat. \u201cYou\u2019re too young for this. You shouldn\u2019t be out here.\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Peter hisses. He feels betrayed, more upset than when Tony Stark had held him on that rooftop and forced him into a horrid, violating Regulation Jacket.\n\u201cThis is too dangerous,\u201d Tony says. \u201cYou\u2019re, what? Twelve?\u201d\nPeter\u2019s hands turn into fists, muscles going taunt.\nTony continues, and to Peter, he sounds infinitely arrogant, \u201cYeah, you should go home, do some homework, take a nap. Hug your parents. Whatever, just get of here and leave it to the big boys, okay?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me what to do,\u201d Peter says. Quips are beyond him, his humour having fled him.\nThe robots are in shambles around them. In the distance, Peter is sure Black Widow or someone equally awesome is punching Doctor Ock in the face. Normally, Peter\u2019d give anything to see that. Now, his stomach is full of stones, weighing him down. It feels as though his idol is spitting in his face.\nTony says, \u201cI\u2019m an adult\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI swear, if the next words out of your mouth are I know better\u2014\u201c\n\u201cLook, you\u2019re too young. Come back when your balls drop, okay?\u201d\nPeters hands tremble, blood pumping in a rage. \u201cHow could you just\u2014how could you order me to stop being Spider-Man when you\u2019ve never even cared before.\u201d\n\u201cYou could get hurt next time,\u201d Tony says flippantly, ignoring Peter. \u201cCan\u2019t have another teenage death on our hands.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve never cared before,\u201d Peter repeats, \u201ceven though I know SHIELD has been aware of my age for ages. You\u2019ve never cared about my family, or the super-villains\u2014like Doc Ock\u2014I\u2019ve fought before, or even dropped in and offered help when the news was playing footage of me getting shot full of bullets. When I almost died, alone, without anyone ringing me or banging on my door asking if I was okay, even though you all knew I was injured. You\u2019re a hacker, you work with SHIELD, a goddamn secret intelligence organisation, don\u2019t pretend you didn\u2019t know. \u201d\nPeter huffs, suddenly out of breath. He feels light, full of adrenaline, like he\u2019s just run a marathon. Anger continues to chase a path through his veins. He continues, \u201cSo how dare you try and order me around now, when you never gave a damn before.\u201d\nDid Iron Man know Nova? Did the Avengers even care about the 15 year old being hurt by super-villains? Apparently not, if they can\u2019t even bring themselves to help Peter, or offer him access to their medical facilities rather than trying to get him to run home, despite the injuries currently decorating his body. Here he is, in front of an Avenger, out of breath and half covered in bruises and blood, littered with deep cuts where he\u2019d been too slow and the sharp ends of the Octobots\u2019 tentacles had sliced into him.\nPeter\u2019s 17 years old next week; he\u2019s 18 months older than Nova was.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Iron Man says, \u201cwe never knew.\u201d\n\u201cBullshit,\u201d Peter says, the swear escaping him without thought. Peter never swears.\nThis is the first they've cared, and it\u2019s in an abstract, distanced sort of way, and they do it by ordering Peter out of this life he\u2019s built for himself?\n\u201cGo home, kid,\u201d Tony says. He jumps into the air, and flies away, leaving Peter shaking in the dust.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPeter has known the Hulk for some time now. They\u2019re not particularly close, but they have an understanding. They\u2019re friends, in a way.\nSo when Peter sees the Hulk heading toward a small invasion of radioactive rabbits\u2014yes, apparently this is Peter\u2019s life now\u2014he doesn\u2019t hesitate to swing over and help.\n\u201cSpider small,\u201d the Hulk says immediately when Peter lands catlike in the middle of the road, ready to join in the firefight.\n\u201cObviously,\u201d Peter says. He gestures to himself, where his spandex does little to hide his narrow frame, delicate shoulders, and thin wrists and ankles.\n\u201cSmall,\u201d Hulk repeats. His stare is intense, but Peter isn\u2019t fazed; they\u2019ve been friends for a while, and though they sometimes go for months without seeing one another, they\u2019re an oddly protective pair. Peter refuses to let anyone treat the Hulk like a wild animal, and Hulk won\u2019t let anything hurt Peter.\nHulk adds, \u201cBaby spider. No fighting.\u201d\nA dangerous concoction of frustration and rage has been simmering away slowly, eating away at the linings of his insides, and it rises forward now, bubbling up his throat. \u201cI\u2019m NOT A CHILD!\u201d\nHe\u2019s never shouted at the Hulk before. The other Super sometimes says things that are hurtful, but Peter has always taken it in stride, let it roll of his shoulders. Now, bristling from Tony\u2019s curt dismissals the day before, Peter is seething.\nHe knows the Hulk won\u2019t lash out and crush him. The Hulk has control, and actually likes Peter. He won\u2019t hurt him. Probably.\n\u201cNo. Spider is,\u201d the Hulk argues, petulant. \u201cYoung. Too small.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m NOT\u2014\u201d\nThe Hulk lays a huge hand on Peter\u2019s chest and pushes him back. He tries for gentle, but Peter still stumbles from the force, though he\u2019s made of sturdy stuff, and stays on his feet.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d Peter says. \u201cI\u2019m going to help no matter what you say.\u201d\nHe takes a couple of steps back before jumping into the air, flipping to shoot a web far above him. The Hulk is fast though and so much stronger, and he snatches Peter out of midair and puts him down on the road.\nPeter tries to dart away, swing back into the skies, but again, the Hulk catches onto his ankle, pulls him down\u2014roughly this time, the Hulk\u2019s annoyance bleeding through\u2014and Peter crashes down hard enough to make the road around him crack.\nHealing factor or not, that\u2019s going to bruise brightly.\n\u201cLeave,\u201d Hulk says. \u201cSpider go be safe.\u201d\n\u201cHulk,\u201d Peter tries weakly, climbing to his feet, rubbing at his side, \u201ccome on, buddy. We\u2019ve helped each other out a bunch of times before, and I was fine then.\u201d\n\u201cTony says\u2014\u201d\n\u201cTony\u2019s an asshole.\u201d The Hulk breathes hot air in his face, eyebrows screwing up, and Peter realises how close those two are, suddenly. He amends, \u201cI mean, he\u2019s a great guy, sure, he\u2019s kind of been my idol since forever, but\u2026 He\u2019s an adult. He doesn\u2019t get it, y\u2019know?\u201d\nApparently, the Hulk doesn\u2019t know, because he says, \u201cTony says spider could get hurt.\u201d\nAh. The Hulk has always been paranoid about that, even before anyone had whispered suggestions in his ear, mentioning how particularly vulnerable Peter is. The Hulk is so large, practically indestructible, and the people around him aren\u2019t. It must be like being friends with glass figurines. The Hulk\u2019s always hovered around him, been there to pull him immediately out of danger.\nPeter\u2019s shoulders slump. He\u2019s so tired. \u201cYeah, bud, I could. I know I could, but I don\u2019t care if I get hurt.\u201d\n\u201cHulk care.\u201d\nThe mask hides Peter\u2019s small, sad smile. \u201cThanks, man, but shouldn\u2019t I get a say about it? It\u2019s my right. I have the freedom to decide what to do with my life.\u201d\n\u201cSpider too small.\u201d\nPeter\u2019s hands form fists, tiny in comparison to the Hulk\u2019s huge meaty ones. His smile is gone; the mask hides that, too.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Peter says. Something blooms in his chest, aching. The familiar sting of betrayal. \u201cOkay.\u201d\nHe wants to blame the Hulk for this\u2014really, really wants to. He wants to blame someone, but can\u2019t quite find it in himself to do so. Everyone\u2019s just\u2026 looking out for him.\nPeter walks away from his friend. He\u2019s usually a blur of movement, walking with his head thrown back, eyes to the sky, but now, he takes level steps, head hanging low, shoulders curled. Like this, Peter does appears small.\nMaybe, Peter thinks, a weight in his stomach, they\u2019re all right.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis jacket is a cage. It\u2019s a physical barrier between Peter and those he wants to help. Needs to help. Spider-Man needs to help people.\nBut this jacket\u2014it\u2019s all people see. When Peter lands flat footed in the streets, people see the blue of his jacket and shut him out. New Yorkers, emergency services, other Supers. They won\u2019t let Peter help.\nSitting on the edge of a high rising building, jacket clenched in white-knuckled fists, Peter tries his best not to shake apart.\nHe takes a deep breath. Another. His fists are bunched into the blue fabric like a lifeline, stopping him from tearing himself apart or falling off the ledge, plummeting, webs unable to pull himself up. Peter\u2019s been having a lot of dreams like that lately.\nHe feels a bit like that now, like he\u2019s falling. Everything is going past him too fast and Peter is scrambling, desperately fighting for purchase on the walls racing past, but he can\u2019t. He\u2019s falling, and the winds whipping past him are like blades, like fingers, ripping into his skin, ripping the suit away from him. Taking Spider-Man away from him.\nPeter exhales roughly. This weariness is not a unique feeling among Supers. He\u2019s spoken with plenty of them. The Fantastic Four, Daredevil, rogue X-Men; they all agree. This life is hard. It brings you down.\nPeter pushes away from the building\u2019s ledge. He finds his bag, tugs on his jeans, tugs off his mask, and goes home.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPeter stops going out.\nThe mask is shoved somewhere under his bed, hidden by a pile of dirty laundry. His Aunt May has stopped digging through his things, respecting his privacy. The mask remains undisturbed.\nThe Regulation Jacket is folded neatly in a locked box on the floor of his cupboard. Untouched.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNew York Times, page 8;\nSince the Super Nova\u2019s death, over a dozen Supers have worn the regulation blue jacket that signifies they are under the age of 18, legally a child. In that time, crime rates have rose drastically, along with the number of deaths in high risk situations involving super-villains, and disunity in inter-superhero relations.\n\nWhich begs the question; are the Regulation Jackets worth it?\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA week later, and the front cover of the morning paper reads, Spider-Man missing?\nThat afternoon, just as school is ending, Peter is ambushed by Johnny Storm.\nThe blond pulls up outside Midtown High in a flashy red car, side window rolled down, the collar of his leather jacket popped. Peter stands on the curb, unimpressed even as Johnny grins winningly at him.\n\u201cGet in,\u201d Johnny says.\n\u201cGo away,\u201d Peter tells him. \u201cYou\u2019re beginning to attract attention.\u201d\nIt\u2019s true, he is. The students flittering out of the school glance at the fancy car, the red paint job glinting prettily in the sun. They eye Peter too, standing by it in raggedy sneakers and old jeans. It\u2019s not a secret that Parkers don\u2019t have much money; Peter\u2019s often teased about it. That Parker kid, with his scholarship and poor family. Poor Parker. Poor, puny Parker.\nJohnny\u2019s expression slides into something harder. \u201cPeter. Get in the car,\u201d he demands.\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d Johnny reaches down to unbuckle his seatbelt. \u201cI\u2019ll just hop out, then. We can chat in front of your school. Bet everyone would love to see the famous, very recognisable Johnny Storm, Human Torch, conversing with regular ol\u2019 Peter Parker, huh?\u201d\nPeter gets in the car.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPeter huddles into the kitchen counter, long fingers playing with a mug of tea. Johnny had pushed it into his hands as soon as Peter had sat down\u2014\u201cSue pushed manners onto me, so now I have to push hot drinks onto you. Apparently, it\u2019s polite.\u201d\u2014but he hasn\u2019t touched it, letting the tea grow cold.\nJohnny is a storm of conversation, bustling around the joined kitchen and living room, fiddling with the TV, fixing them snacks. Constant movement, distracting. Without even realising it, Peter finds himself relaxing.\nPeter\u2019s been to the Baxter Building plenty of times. Now, though, Peter doesn\u2019t feel the usual happy buzz he associates with the familiar place. He feels cold. Empty.\n\u201cPeter,\u201d Johnny says suddenly, catching his attention, leaning against the kitchen bench opposite Peter. \u201cYou know, this whole thing isn\u2019t that bad.\u201d\nPeter immediately goes taut, glaring at the blond. \u201cLike you\u2019d know.\u201d\n\u201cHey, I\u2019m underage, too.\u201d\n\u201cHaven\u2019t seen you wearing the\u2014\u201c Peter screws his face up in disgust. \u201c\u2014the jacket.\u201d\n\u201cWell, yeah, I\u2019m part of a team of adults. There\u2019s a clause.\u201d Johnny clears his throat, and quotes, haughtily, \u201c\u2018If the Super\u2019s identity and age are known to two or more superhuman teammates, then they are not required to wear a Regulation Jacket.\u2019\u201d\nPeter glares harder. \u201cShut the fuck up, Storm.\u201d\nJohnny pretends to gasp, body curling back, scandalised. \u201cPeter Parker, you swore! Call Captain America, the boy scout swore!\u201d\n\u201cI said, shut the fuck up.\u201d\n\u201cThere! You did it again! Whatever happened to \u2018being a role model for little fans\u2019, huh?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no kids here.\u201d Peter squints at Johnny, and corrects, \u201cWell, aside from you.\u201d\nJohnny laughs, and the moment is broken. The blond hero darts off to collect something from another room, playfully ruffling Peter\u2019s hair as he passes.\nIt isn\u2019t until Peter gets a call from his Aunt a little while later, asking him to hurry home and could he please buy milk on his way, that Johnny catches him around his arm, and turns serious again.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Peter,\u201d Johnny tries.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d Peter says hoarsely.\n\u201cYou\u2019re strong; you\u2019ll make it through this. You always do.\u201d\nPeter shrugs him off. \u201cYeah, well. It\u2019s different this time, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nJohnny Storm is a good friend, a good person. Empathetic, concerned after the wellbeing of others; he\u2019s more like his sister than he\u2019ll let on. His worry shows in his open expression. \u201cPeter, is there anything the Four can do?\u201d\nPeter\u2019s gaze remains hard. \u201cUnless you have a time machine? No.\u201d\n\u201cHey, you never know what Reeds has down in his labs.\u201d\nJohnny attempts a light-hearted smile, but it falls flat, only managing to stretch out his face, looking wrong, plastic.\nThere\u2019s an awkward moment where Johnny stares at Peter, a lump stuck in his throat at he fumbles with this, the limitations of their friendship. Johnny has no idea how to reach past that barrier and help his friend. He wants to fix this, but he has no idea how to. Johnny should\u2019ve\u2014he should\u2019ve interfered sooner. Helped Pete.\nPeter, drowning in his situation, struggling keeping his chin above the surface, does not meet Johnny\u2019s gaze.\n\u201cI have to go,\u201d Peter says finally.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Johnny says.\nPeter leaves. Johnny stays in the middle of the kitchen, hands curled into frustrated fists, staring after him.\nSue comes home soon after, and looks surprised to find Johnny standing by himself, glaring at the doorway\n\u201cJohnny?\u201d she prompts. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Is\u2026 is there anything I can do?\u201d\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t happen to have a time machine, would you?\u201d When that fails to elicit even a smile from her, Johnny sighs deeply. He pauses, then frowns, then looks at her, considering, a plan beginning to take form. \u201cActually, Sue\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cPeter?\u201d\nPeter\u2019s voice is muffled, words collected by the pillow he\u2019s shoved his face into. \u201cGo \u2018way!\u201d\n\u201cPeter, you have to come down sometime.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m staying in my room forever!\u201d\nPeter hears the door to his room creak open slowly, and then his Aunt\u2019s soft, sympathetic voice; \u201cOh, honey.\u201d\nThe mound of pillows and blankets moves as Peter shifts on his bed, rolling over and pulling down his comforter enough to expose his bloodshot eyes and the top of his bed-head.\n\u201cEverything is terrible,\u201d Peter tells her solemnly. \nAunt May takes a seat on the edge of his bed, running a hand through his hair and scratching at his scalp like she usually does when he\u2019s sick and whiny. \u201cYou want to talk about it?\u201d\nPeter presses into her touch, letting his eyes flutter shut. \u201cReally don\u2019t,\u201d he says.\nMaybe he\u2019s not dealing with this like an adult. Maybe building himself a nest of blankets and pillows and taking refuge in the dark isn\u2019t the mature, responsible way to deal with this. After all, Peter has been demanding other\u2019s treat him like an adult and yet here he is, acting like a small child.\nBut, hey. Everything is terrible, and his Aunt May is the best. Can anyone really blame him?\n\u201cI made cookies,\u201d says Aunt May.\n\u201cOh, my god,\u201d says Peter. \u201cI love you.\u201d\nAunt May disappears, and returns less than five minutes later with a plate of warm choc chip cookies and a tall glass of milk, a folded newspaper tucked under her arm.\nPeter just about drools at the desert she hands him, but scrunches up his nose at the paper.\n\u201cI thought you liked doing the crosswords?\u201d\nPeter makes a face. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see another newspaper ever again.\u201d\nAunt May nods, accepting that easily\u2014probably assuming it has something to do with the disastrous job interview Peter had a few months back with the Bugle for a temporary internship. Admittedly, Peter does cringe whenever he thinks about it; he still has nightmares about Jameson, plagued by vivid images of the man\u2014the way his upper lip jiggled when he yelled, decorating with sweat and spittle, and a dancing caterpillar of a moustache. Eugh.\nAunt May unfolds the paper, moving to put it away. Peter catches a flash of the front page and his heart jumps into his throat.\n\u201cACTUALLY,\u201d Peter shouts, starting fully upward. The sudden movement jostles his glass, and milk spills all over his pyjamas. \u201cAh, fudge\u2014\u201d\n\u201cPeter,\u201d Aunt May admonishes gently.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the\u2014the paper, can I just\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got milk everywhere. You need to be more careful.\u201d\nStill, she hands him the paper, and he snatches it up, standing up to inspect the front page. Peter stands in the middle of his room in soiled pyjamas, mouth hanging open, unbelieving. \u201cIs this\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t released you were such a big Fantastic Four fan, Peter.\u201d\n\u201cEr,\u201d he says, looking up at his suspicious Aunt. \u201cI think they\u2019re cool?\u201d\nShe laughs at his bewildered, half-guilty look, and says, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, Peter.\u201d Quieter, she says, \u201cThat Johnny Storm is rather handsome, I can\u2019t blame you.\u201d Peter ignores that.\n\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d he says, surveying the photograph splayed over the front page.\n\u201cStrange, I know. I always thought everyone in the Fantastic Four but Johnny Storm were adults?\u201d\nThe photo on the front page is of Fantastic Four mid-battle. It\u2019s nothing uncommon\u2014Supers\u2019 fights often end up on the front page of newspapers\u2014but Peter\u2019s eye catches on their uniforms and the contrasting tones of blues.\nThe Fantastic Four uniform is a dark blue, while the Regulation Jacket is a horrid, powdery baby blue. The two tones clash horribly, looking worse than they had on Peter. All four of them wear the Regulation Jacket, including a visible Sue and a Johnny Storm not fire and Ben, who\u2019s jacket looks like it was specially tailored six sizes up to fit him.\nPeter cannot breath; he knows how much effort it would take to wear those jackets. Johnny and Sue couldn\u2019t have used their powers due to it, and Ben looks distinctly uncomfortable.\nAunt May peers at the picture. \u201cMr Fantastic is greying. They all definitely look like adults.\u201d\n\u201cThey are,\u201d Peter says.\n\u201cThen why\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cWho knows?\u201d His grip on the paper is tight, and his lips creep upward, a slowly blooming smile. They did this for him. \u201cWho knows\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s still not enough.\nPeter thinks about putting the suit back on, but every time he tries, he catches sight of the obnoxious blue of the Regulation Jacket, smug and pristine next to his weathered suit, and he just. Can\u2019t.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnother week slips past without a Spider-Man appearance.\nPeter wants to go out; he misses it, and finds himself drifting off in class more, daydreaming about careening arches through the sky, air whipping past him, the swoop of his stomach during free-fall, the joy when he pulls and arches back up again\u2026\nHe really, really misses it.\nHe\u2019s not the only one missing Spider-Man. On Thursday, Peter overhears Flash talking frantically with several classmates behind him.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think something\u2019s happened to him, do you?\u201d Flash asks, wringing his hands. He looks like a nervous mother. \u201cIt\u2019s not like him to stay away this long.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s been missing for longer,\u201d a shorter boy points out.\nFlash bites at his lip. \u201cMaybe\u2026\u201d\n\u201cMaybe he was grounded,\u201d Sally Avrin adds from two seats over, snickering to herself. \u201cOr he was probably too busy at middle school to bother with crime fighting.\u201d\n\u201cShut the hell up,\u201d Flash snaps. He has no patience for people bad-mouthing Spider-Man.\n\u201cWhy are you so enamoured with a child?\u201d Sally asks.\n\u201cSpider-Man\u2019s a hero,\u201d Flash says.\n\u201cA child,\u201d Sally repeats, scoffing. \u201cNew York is better off without him.\u201d\nPeter sinks lower in his seat, pulling nervously at the sleeves of his hoodie.\n\u201cNew York is suffering without him,\u201d Flash shoots back.\nThe two classmates behind nod, the short boy piping up, \u201cYeah, haven\u2019t you seen the crime rates? They\u2019ve gone up by a lot, and the number of deaths in muggings\u2014\u201d\nPeter\u2019s breath has caught in his throat. He sits up straighter, biting back thoughts of his gasping Uncle dying under his shaking, useless hands. Hadn\u2019t Peter vowed to do everything he could to prevent that? To always be there, to stop that happening to other people?\n\u201c\u2014has also increased, not to mention the number of super-villains attacks.\u201d\nFlash nods. \u201cYeah, New York needs Spider-Man!\u201d\nSally huffs angrily and turns away. \u201cWhatever, enjoy fangirling over some little twerp in tights, see if I care.\u201d\nThe teacher marches in then and calls the class to attention, halting the class\u2019 conversations. Peter doesn\u2019t listen to a single thing said during the period, frozen in his seat, focussed the entire hour on breathing around the ball of guilt and anxiety swelling in his chest. First Uncle Ben, now countless New Yorkers. How many more have to die before Peter stops neglecting people who need him? Selfish, Parker. Selfish, selfish.\n\u201cHey, Peter?\u201d\nPeter starts violently, coming back to himself to see the class beginning to file out for lunch. Flash Thompson stands beside him, looking confused at Peter\u2019s reaction.\n\u201cUm,\u201d Peter says, shaking himself, \u201csorry. Er. What did you say, Flash?\u201d\n\u201cI was wondering what you thought about Spider-Man coming back,\u201d Flash says, eyeing Peter with furrowed brows.\nPeter hides his hands under his desk, clenching and unclenching them into fists. \u201cHow should I know?\u201d\nFlash shrugs and looks away. \u201cWell, you used to take photos of him, right? Before Jameson turned you down for the internship?\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Peter takes a deep breath. Lets it out. \u201cI think. I think Spider-Man\u2019s going to come back.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d Flash asks, hopeful.\nPeter steels his shoulders. No more running. No more letting down the people he\u2019s sworn to protect. Who have protected Peter in turn.\n\u201cReally,\u201d Peter promises.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe have a code red in progress!\u201d Jeff ducks to avoid a thrown motorbike, one hand braced to protect his head, the other holding his comm. \u201cRepeat, code red.\u201d\nFloating above the confusion, Electro laughs, rippling with energy. Head thrown back, chest thrown forward, arms stretched out. Electricity shoots around him, cracking the pavement and sending pedestrians running screaming as the buildings around them began to crumble, lights flickering on and off sporadically.\nJeff stands amongst the chaos, shouting into his comm, \u201cDoes anyone have visual on any Supers?\u201d\nWhen he receives no response, he grits his teeth, and bites out, \u201cRepeat! Does anyone have visual on Supers? Does anyone have visual on Spider-Man?\u201d\nThe police had quickly learned to rely on Supers out of necessity. Here, in a battlefield far above their abilities, the NYPD are out-gunned.\nElectro spews destruction, laughing manically, felling buildings with the barest effort. The police has been thrown in the deep end, and without the aid of Supers to keep the city afloat, they\u2019d drown.\nA glob of web hits Electro in the shoulder, unbalancing him and drawing his attention. \u201cWhat\u2014!\u201d\nSpider-Man flips out of the sky, landing in the middle of the destruction with a flippant, \u201cYou rang?\u201d\nJeff slumps, near boneless, against the cruiser at his back. He offers the Super a blooming smile, and greets, \u201cSpidey! Good to have you back!\u201d\nPeter offers a tiny wave, laughing easily like he hasn\u2019t been missing for over a month. \u201cYou miss me, Jeff?\u201d\n\u201cYes!\u201d\nJeff\u2019s vehement answer must throw Spider-Man off guard, because the small Super tips his head back, eying Jeff. \u201cHuh.\u201d\n\u201cSpider-Man!\u201d Electro has collected himself, now flat-footed, electricity gathered in both hands. He looks pissed. \u201cI thought you were gone for good.\u201d\nSpider-Man shrugs again, far too unconcerned and casual in the middle of such chaos. \u201cNothing can keep me down for long.\u201d\nElectro snarls, throwing a handful of sparking light at Spidey, who ducks and rolls out of the way, climbing to his feet and then into the air.\nThe fight is fast paced, electricity and webs flying faster than the eye can catch, but it is over soon enough, Electro left wheezing against the pavement, limbs bound by webs. Spider-Man stands over him, triumphant.\n\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d Spidey, the cocky shit, says. He does a little, victorious shimmy, swinging his hips, wrists held high above his head. \u201cWho\u2019s the spider? I\u2019m the spider!\u201d\n\u201cYou wish,\u201d says Electro, smiling up at Spider-Man. \u201cYour real battle has only just begun.\u201d\nSpider-Man drops his wrists, straightening up. \u201cWow, that wasn\u2019t ominous and cliche at all. What \u2018real battle\u2019? My battle to find an opponent who\u2019s actually capable of holding their own against me? Ha!\u201d\nElectro manages a cocksure smirk, bound and incapacitated as he is. \u201cHow about five other opponents?\u201d he asks, eyes pointedly looking up. Spider-Man freezes.\nFive figures descend from the sky, landing in a wonky circle around the tense Super, surrounding him. Jeff swears under his breath, and fumbles with his comm, whispering commands for back up. They\u2019re going to need so, so much back up. (\u201cCall the Avengers, the Fantastic Four,\u201d Jeff pants, voice shaky, \u201cthe\u2014the president, just call someone, send\u2014send everyone, shit!\u201d)\nJeff surveys the villains, recognising them\u2014Doctor Octopus, Rhino, Sandman, Vulture. He spots Shocker freeing Electro from the binding webs and helping the other villain climb to his feet.\nAll of them are past enemies of Spider-Man, he realises with a jolt. Oh, no.\n\u201cUm,\u201d Spider-Man says weakly. \u201cEvening fellas?\u201d\nThe six super-villains remain unimpressed, looking angry and menacing. Rhino cracks his knuckles pointedly.\n\u201cTaking a leaf out of the Avengers book with the whole team-up thing, huh?\u201d Spidey babbles. \u201cI have to say, team of super-villains, that\u2019s actually pretty smart. Terrifying\u2014like for real, oh my god, holy cannoli, I definitely peed a little\u2014but smart. Kudos, guys. Do you have a super-cool super-villain name, yet?\u201d\n\u201cThe Sinster Six,\u201d Sandman says proudly.\nSpidey claps, nodding his head. \u201cHey, I like that! Good work, guys. You got the man-power, you got the cool name, now all you need is some skill to actually defeat me.\u201d\nA growl ripples through the villains. Rhino ducks his head, rolling his shoulders in preparation. \u201cYou little twerp,\u201d Rhino rumbles. \u201cI\u2019m gonna destroy you.\u201d\nDoctor Ock smiles, something wicked sharp and promising. \u201cNo, Rhino. We will crush him.\u201d\nSpidey glances around at the six villains, stretching their arms, readying themselves to charge, to attack, and swallows audibly.\n\u201cCan\u2019t we talk about this?\u201d Spidey tries. \u201cSit down, maybe have some dinner\u2014\u201d\nHe\u2019s cut off as Rhino and Vulture lunge for him. He backflips into the air, swinging away. The Six follow him in a mad scramble of limbs.\nJeff is forced to crouch behind a police cruiser during the ensuing fight. This is so, so far above his pay grade. He doesn\u2019t have the abilities to handle this; he can do nothing but huddle into himself, and watch as his hero struggles against a brutal, fast paced fight.\nJeff squeezes his eyes shut. Spidey\u2019s losing, badly. The Super is going to need medical attention, the serious kind, if he even manages to worm his way out of this fight at all.\n\u201cRequesting back up,\u201d Jeff repeats into his comm. \u201cMultiple armed, dangerous super-villains. Spider-Man is injured and outnumbered, hurry, I\u2019m not sure how long he\u2019ll be able to fight them off\u2014\u201d\nOne of Doctor Ock\u2019s tentacles catches Spidey around the middle, sending the underage hero into the arms of Rhino, who holds him tight, grinning as Spidey struggles wildly.\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna crush a bug!\u201d Rhino says.\nSpidey coughs, trying desperately to inhale properly\u2014choked off, breaths sounding wet with what Jeff hopes isn't blood\u2014and attempting and failing to form a snappy reply.\n\u201cI have awaited this day a long time,\u201d Doctor Ock says, advancing on the restrained vigilante. \u201cTo see you, bound and helpless, brings me true happiness. I am so looking forward to your death.\u201d\n\u201cI want to do the honours,\u201d Shocker pipes up. \u201cLet me at him.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not fair, I wanted to kill the freak,\u201d Vulture squawks.\nRhino growls. \u201cI want to!\u201d\nPeter can barely keep his eyes open. His body has started to shut down from his mounting injuries and the exhaustion of fighting six super-villains at once. As his eyes shutter close, he barely makes out the blur of red and baby blue, though he clearly hears the shouted, \u201cHey! I\u2019m the one who does the killing around here, buck-o!\u201d\nPeter is dropped to the ground, and groans as his injuries are jostled. He looks up to see Rhino frozen, Deadpool bolting toward them, katana held high, bringing down his weapon in a high arch.\n\u201cNo killing!\u201d Peter shouts, and Deadpool stills the blade bare inches from Rhino\u2019s throat.\n\u201cN\u2019aww,\u201d Deadpool whines, dropping the katana, and crossing his arms over his chest dramatically. \u201cMooooom, you never let me have any fun! Dad always lets me kill the bad guys!\u201d\nPeter isn\u2019t sure if Deadpool is making a joke, or alluding to someone else being the father to Peter\u2019s mother. He hopes Deadpool doesn\u2019t mean Daredevil. That is not an image he wants to preserve.\n\u201cOi, who the \u2018ell are you?\u201d Shocker demands, glaring at Deadpool\u2019s sulking figure.\nDeadpool\u2019s voice drops, deep and gravelly, a distorted cross between Batman and Wolverine. \u201cYour doom,\u201d he says, before issuing a high pitched war cry and leaping at Shocker and Rhino. Shocker shrieks, high-pitched.\nPeter tries to jump away from the fight, but he\u2019s exhausted, drenched in sweat and blood, and aching all over. One of Ock\u2019s tentacles snakes around his waist, dragging him forward to face the sneering villain.\n\u201cSpider-Man,\u201d Doc Ock spits, \u201cyou\u2019ve acquired a friend since we last spoke, have you? No matter, it will not stop us from defeating you.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you people have anything better to do?\u201d Peter asks, weakly. \u201cSeriously, doesn\u2019t villainry get old? Get a hobby, man. Pick up knitting or something.\u201d\nOck makes an annoyed noise in the back of his throat, and the mechanical tentacle tightens, growing painful. Peter yelps and tries to wiggle in Ock\u2019s grip to no amends.\n\u201cYou cannot escape us this time,\u201d Ock says. \u201cThis time, it is your blood that\u2014\u201d\nA hammer throws Ock bodily across the street. Peter sprawls along the pavement, blinking up at the golden image Thor makes, Mjolnir in hand, his brilliant image marred only by the baby blue jacket stretched across his shoulders.\n\u201cYou will not harm the young hero, villain,\u201d Thor says lowly. Peter can hear the order in his voice.\nOck stumbles to his feet, gaping at the prince. \u201cAn Avenger?\u201d\nCaptain America jogs to stand by Thor, shield in hand, wearing his full suit, a blue jacket, and a steely expression. \u201cTwo Avengers.\u201d\nBlack Widow melts from the shadows. \u201cThree.\u201d\nPeter\u2019s advanced senses allows him to hear the distant, answering, \u201cFour!\u201d It came from high above them, a lower building\u2019s rooftop. Peter glances up to see a waving purple glove and the hint of a quiver full of arrows.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t sign up for this,\u201d Sandman says. He transforms back into his flesh and blood form, his skin looking pale around his striped shirt.\n\u201cThen you should\u2019ve thought twice about attacking this nice young man,\u201d Captain America says dryly, grinning.\nElectro shouts, angry and full of energy, and he scrambles off of the ground to lunge at Peter. His arm, outreached and glowing, is knocked away before it can make contact with Peter. Electro howls as the shield bounces away from his limb, returning back to Captain America easily.\nDoc Ock has already climbed back to his feet, and he ignores all the other Supers, racing toward Peter\u2019s still hunched form, his actions mirrored by a swooping Vulture, Sandman, and Electro. Shocker aims his hands at Peter.\nPeter squeezes his eyes shut, bracing himself, only to hear the clash of metal, the thud of colliding flesh, and nothing coming near him. When he looks around him, he sees Thor high above, winning in a fight against Vulture. Black Widow has thrown her thighs around Shocker\u2019s waist, and twists, throwing him against a wall in a move Peter himself has been trying to imitate. Captain America darts between Electro and Sandman, shield ricocheting around the street.\nDeadpool has a fistful of Ock\u2019s hair, a katana through one of the villain\u2019s shoulders\u2014non-lethal, maybe, but Peter still winces at the brutality of the act. Deadpool is pulling out Ock\u2019s tentacles, twisting and tugging until they wrench free, spraying wires and sparks, before throwing them over his shoulder and starting on the next tentacle.\nRhino lays face down in the road several metres away, twitching sporadically. An electric arrow juts out from his back.\nPeter lies on the street, eyes wide. He aches all over, and each passing moment it grows harder to breath, but\u2026\nBut the Supers around him are here. Peter remembers, when he was younger, before he became a Super himself, admiring superheroes with huge, awed eyes. Peter feels that awe now, that same wonder and amazement. He feels\u2014for the first time since he put on the suit, since Uncle Ben bleed out under his shaking hands\u2014safe. Like maybe everything will be okay.\nThese people are here. Fighting for him. Each wearing identical Regulation Jackets.\n\u201cAw!\u201d Johnny Storm stands in the middle of the street, arms crossed over his own baby blue jacket, glaring at the other Supers. \u201cNo fair, I was hoping to be the knight in shining armour today.\u201d\n\u201cWe came all the way out here for n\u2019thing?\u201d Ben asks. His Regulation Jacket is beginning to split around the seams.\n\u201cSeems like it,\u201d Sue says, leaning against Reed and sighing. The Four appear exactly like that had in the newspaper with their matching clashing-blue Regulation Jackets and and suits.\n\u201c\u2018Torch?\u201d Peter calls. Maybe the Six did really kill him, maybe he\u2019s really ripping open, floundering in a public street, and this is all one big, hallucination induced by excessive blood loss. Peter wobbles on shaky feet.\n\u201cShit, Spidey!\u201d Johnny jogs to his side, placing a hand around Peter\u2019s back, steadying him. \u201cDude, are you okay?\u201d\nPeter laughs at that, high and mostly hysterical, because he\u2019s confused, he\u2019s in in shock. Fear and the dregs of adrenaline race through his blood. \u201cMaybe? God, just\u2014what\u2019s going on?\u201d\nJohnny grins. \u201cSupers got to look after each other, Pete\u2019. Who else will, otherwise?\u201d\nJohnny is dragged away by the rest of the four, only to be replaced by a slightly damp Deadpool\u2014sweat? Blood? The red suit makes it difficult to tell; Peter supposes that\u2019s the point\u2014running a hand over the crown of Peter\u2019s skull and cooing over how adorable a damsel in distress Peter makes. The mercenary is chased away by an approaching Captain America giving him the evil eye.\n\u201cYou okay, son?\u201d Captain America asks, offering a hand to Peter, who takes it, letting himself be hauled up.\n\u201cI am now, but\u2014\u201d Peter glances around at the unconscious Six; at the news-crew gathering down the street, where they\u2019re free to stand without worrying about being caught in the middle of a fight should violence break out again, interviewing the Four; at Thor and Black Widow staring blankly at a bouncing Deadpool; at the Captain, smiling gently at him. Peter blurts, \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Captain America repeats.\n\u201cWhy\u2014why did you step in? They\u2019re my villains, I was the one that pissed them off, and they were only after me\u2026\u201d\nThe Captain smiles gently, and Peter forgets his injuries, feels warm and guarded. \u201cBecause,\u201d he says, \u201cyou\u2019re a Super. I\u2019ve seen the things you do for this city, how you protect it. You deserve to be protected yourself.\u201d Steve glances down at his own chest, where a Regulation Jacket is straining over his broad shoulders. \u201cAnd it was the least we could do, after the hassle these caused this.\u201d\n\u201cThe jackets?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t agree with them,\u201d Steve says. \u201cNever did. Some of the others are beginning to realise that, too.\u201d\nA loud grumble and the panicked cries of the journalists down the street catch their attention. The Hulk stands by Thor and breathes through his nose, glaring at the Asgardian.\n\u201cYou missed a mighty battle,\u201d Thor says, grinning. \u201cNot that it matters. I was there, and so everything was well.\u201d\n\u201cThor\u2014\u201d Hulk begins.\nSteve sighs and calls the Hulk over before Thor can egg the larger Avenger into a fistfight. The Hulk comes eagerly when he spies Peter.\n\u201cSpider,\u201d Hulk says. He doesn\u2019t seem happy to see patches of blood smudging Peter\u2019s suit.\nPeter opens his mouth, a greeting on his lips, but the Captain cuts him off. \u201cHe\u2019s here,\u201d Steve says, and Peter freezes.\nA golden and red suit lands in the middle of the street with a whine of engines. Iron Man approaches Peter, and he feels something seize in his throat. Apprehension, maybe. Panic. The knowledge that nothing good happens to him\u2014and, Peter has learned, that if it does, he doesn\u2019t deserve to hold onto it\u2014and so the universe has come to right itself, take away what little hope the Supers had restored in Peter tonight.\n\u201cHey, big guy,\u201d Iron Man says to the Hulk. \u201cWant to give me and bug-boy here some privacy?\u201d The Hulk huffs a displeased breath. \u201cPleasssse? Come on, five minutes?\u201d\nThe Hulk grumbles under his breath, but lets the Captain come forward and guide him away. Peter knows most people are terrified of the Hulk. He makes people feel unsafe, with his temper and large bulk, but as Peter watches the Hulk go, he feels a growing sense of unease.\nWhen they\u2019re finally alone, Iron Man addresses Peter; \u201cI see the calvary arrived in time.\u201d\nPeter nods, a stilted, jerky movement. \u201cSurprisingly, yeah.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well\u2026\u201d Iron Man shifts, as best one can in a heavy mechanical suit. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re okay. It would suck if you were vulnerable because of those damn jackets.\u201d\n\u201cDoes this mean you\u2019re not going to hunt me down if I don\u2019t wear one?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? No, no, of course not, we\u2019re all wearing them, so.\u201d\nPeter stares at Tony expectantly, awaiting an explanation. When Tony fails to present one, he presses, \u201cSo?\u201d\n\u201c\u2018So?\u2019\u201d Iron Man gestures at the Supers around them, some supervising the arrest and transport of the Six, the others chatting with each other or, in Johnny\u2019s case, the press. All of them still wore their Regulation Jackets. \u201cSo, everyone\u2019s wearing the jackets. The kids, the adults, the\u2014Deadpools.\u201d\nPeter continues to stare. \u201c\u2026.So?\u201d\n\u201cSooo, you can\u2019t tell who the underage Supers are if everyone\u2019s wearing the jackets, can you?\u201d\nIron Man\u2019s suit begins to come apart. First, the helmet falls back to reveal a soft eyed Tony Stark, then the suit\u2019s middle rips open, revealing a pastel blue jacket hidden beneath the layers of metal, worn atop a band t-shirt and ratty jeans.\n\u201cYou too?\u201d Peter asks, barely breathing. His pulse is loud in his ears.\nTony offers him a small smile. \u201cYeah. Me too.\u201d\nPeter lifts shaking fingers to the zipper of his own Regulation Jacket, hardly daring to hope. After all the hurt this thing had caused, the isolation, the desperation, could Peter really just\u2014\n\u201cGo ahead,\u201d Tony urges.\n\u2014take it off.\nThe jacket unzips easily, and Peter throws it across the street, letting it land on the damp pavement metres away.\nTony cups his hands around his mouth. \u201cHey, Hulk!\u201d he shouts, waiting for the Hulk to raise his head and look at them. \u201cYeah, buddy, you see that blue thing?\u201d Hulk points at the scrap of baby blue, formerly Peter\u2019s, sitting abandoned in the street. Tony grins. \u201cYeah, that. Feel like destroying it for us?\u201d\nHulk smiles eagerly. \u201cHulk smash?\u201d\n\u201cHulk smash.\u201d\nHulk pounds a meaty fist over the jacket, cracking the concrete around it, before lifting the jacket, an end in each hand, and tearing it brutally down the middle. Tatters of blue cloth rain down around him.\n\u201cSpidey?\u201d Tony murmurs. Both of them are focussed on the grinning Hulk, neither of them looking at each other. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nPeter forgives him.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe New York papers feature a brightly coloured montage of Supers the next day. Peter refuses to look at any of them, too busy being wrapped in bandages in the Baxter Building, but if he did, he wouldn\u2019t have been disappointed at the headlines.\n\nSPIDER-MAN DEFENDED. THE BIRTH AND DEATH OF THE SINISTER SIX. SUPERHUMAN ALLIANCES. THE LEGITIMACY OF THE REGULATION JACKETS; ARE THEY REALLY NECESSARY?\n\nA week later, Peter finds a newspaper that Aunt May strangely left out on the kitchen table. He fiddles with it, tracing the cover with a long finger.\nSPIDER-MAN AND THE REGULATION JACKET, the headline reads. Beneath it is the subheading in bolded black text.\n\n\u2026Speculation says Spider-Man isn't underage after all.\n\nHuh.\n\u00a0\n."
