    "text": "Timothy has been crying for almost an hour now. Increasingly annoyed, Jack has been starting to eye the whiskey, even though they have to leave the house soon, and painkillers have done nothing to ease Janet\u2019s headache. Pretty soon, she\u2019s going to be reaching for the whiskey herself if her son doesn\u2019t stop. \n\u201cBe quiet,\u201d she says for what must be the dozenth time. \u201cJust for a little while, okay, honey? Just until Mommy and Daddy are gone.\u201d\nThe words have the opposite effect. Timothy wails harder, clutching the bars of his crib. Jack sighs loudly and leaves the room, but Janet hasn\u2019t yet finished packing, and at this rate she never will, not with all this noise. \n\u201cIf you don\u2019t stop crying-\u201c She says, and stops. She won\u2019t be around to carry out any punishment she might use as a threat, and there is no way she\u2019s going to let the nanny administer it. But she just. She just needs this to stop. \nSuddenly, inspiration hits. Janet bows down until she\u2019s on eye-level with her son, and says, \u201cIf you don\u2019t stop crying, Batman is going to come and take you away.\u201d\nTimothy\u2019s mouth falls open. \u201cBa\u2019man?\u201d\nJanet nods firmly. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Batman comes for misbehaving little boys and takes them away forever. Do you want that?\u201d\nHer son, tears slowly drying on his face, shakes his head, and Janet nods again and pats him lightly on the cheek. \n\u201cGood,\u201d she says. Finally, there is silence.\n*\n\u201cDon\u2019t chew with your mouth open.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\u201cIf you chew with your mouth open, Batman will come and get you.\u201d\n*\n\u201cTimothy, I\u2019ve told you before, hurry up, Suzie hates it when people are late to her gatherings. And you know who else hates it when people are late? Batman.\u201d\n*\n\u201cWhen are you coming back?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve told you, we\u2019ll contact you when we know the details.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but are you coming back this month? Or next month? Can\u2019t you tell me anything?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk to your mother like that, young man. You\u2019re never to take that tone with her, do you hear me? If I hear you being rude again, I think you can guess who I\u2019m going to tell.\u201d\n\u201cDad, no!\u201d\n\u201cWhoa, I didn\u2019t say I was going to, did I? I just said I might. Kids these days.\u201d\n*\nDick has gotten into a fight with Bruce, again. If Bruce had just listened to him for one goddamn time, the plan could have worked. But he didn\u2019t, and so it didn\u2019t, and Bruce ended up with bruised ribs and, naturally, still insisted on finishing patrol for the night. \nIn order to avoid getting into (yet another) shouting match on Gotham\u2019s streets, they\u2019ve split up their usual patrol route. At least, Dick thinks, he\u2019s allowed to go solo. At least Bruce still trusts him that much. \n\u201cStupid Batman,\u201d he mutters under his breath. \u201cStupid-\u201c He breaks off as he hears a loud noise that sound suspiciously like an explosion. A small one, but, still, an explosion. \nInstantly, he jumps into action, his bad mood forgotten. It\u2019s not hard to follow the noise, seeing as it\u2019s only two blocks away, and within less than a minute, he lands in an alley, where there is a trashcan on fire. That, in itself, is not that unusual for Gotham. What is unusual is that first, the trashcan is the only thing on fire, and second, there aren\u2019t any teenagers or drunk idiots nearby who would be obvious culprits. In fact, the alley is suspiciously empty.\nDick looks around, wary, and tenses when someone emerges from a doorway. \nAs soon as the person fully steps into the light of the flickering streetlights, he relaxes again, though only a little bit. In Gotham, anyone can turn into a surprise enemy. \nAlthough, Dick has to admit, it doesn\u2019t seem likely that this one will. \n\u201cOh,\u201d says the little kid that\u2019s now staring at him, pale face illuminated by the flames, \u201cit\u2019s you.\u201d\nDick laughs. \u201cSounding a bit disappointed there, kiddo.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d the kid says quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s an honour to meet you, Robin. I just- is there any chance I could talk to Batman?\u201d\n\u201cBatman? Why?\u201d Dick asks, but the boy doesn\u2019t reply. Making sure his voice is gentle, Dick asks, \u201cWould you like to report a crime?\u201d\nThe kid straightens at that. \u201cYes! Yes, I would.\u201d\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Dick says carefully. \u201cHow about you tell me first, and then we\u2019ll go find Batman, okay?\u201d\nFor a few seconds, there is no sound except the crackling and sizzling of the fire. Eventually, though, the boy nods. \u201cOkay. I\u2019d like to turn myself in. It was me.\u201d\nDick\u2019s mind blanks. \u201cWhat was?\u201d\nThe kid points at the trashcan. \u201cThat. I did that, and I\u2019m- I\u2019m not sorry.\u201d\nThere is clearly a lot to unpack here. Dick decides to start with the easiest one. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\u201cTim.\u201d The kid says it like it\u2019s a challenge. \n\u201cAnd where are your parents, Tim?\u201d\n\u201cNot here,\u201d Tim says, crossing his arms. \u201cWhy are you- wait. You\u2019re going to take me home, aren\u2019t you? You lied to me.\u201d\n\u201cLook, Tim,\u201d Dick says, holding up his hands to show he means no harm, \u201cI\u2019m sure your parents are very worried about you. Why don\u2019t you tell me where you live, how does that sound? I promise I won\u2019t tell Batman a thing about this,\u201d he adds, following a sudden bout of inspiration. He adds a wink, to show Tim that they\u2019re on the same side here. \nTim, though, does not seem receptive to this. He only repeats, \u201cYou lied to me,\u201d in a voice of utter betrayal. Dick feels bad about this, he does, but he fixed it, didn\u2019t he? He knows Batman can be scary, and he told the kid he won\u2019t tell on him, something that Tim is clearly worried about.\nThere\u2019s one thing left to try, and it\u2019s a good, old-fashioned bribe. Dick gets down on one knee, to be more on eye-level with the kid, and says, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what. There\u2019s a diner only two blocks from here. We\u2019ll go there, I\u2019ll buy you ice cream, and we\u2019ll just chat a bit more, alright? There\u2019s no harm in that, is there?\u201d\nTim considers this. Eventually, he gives a stiff nod. Dick smiles at him. \u201cExcellent. I\u2019ll just put out that fire real quick, and then we can be on our way.\u201d\nHe does what he said, dutifully extinguishing the flames until all that\u2019s left is a smouldering pile of plastic. Oh, well. Someone will be around in the morning to take care of it. \nDick turns out, ready to properly impress the kid with his grapple gun \u2013 only to stop dead, turning his head in every direction, searching for someone who, frankly, is not there anymore. \nHe calls out the kid\u2019s name, but it\u2019s too late, like he\u2019d suspected it would be. No one answers. Tim is gone. \nLater, when they\u2019re in the Cave and Bruce, either having forgotten about their earlier argument or choosing to ignore it, asks how the rest of patrol went, Dick thinks about mentioning the kid he met. In the end, though, he doesn\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t a big deal, all things considered. Nothing really happened. Just a strange conversation, nothing more. By the next morning, he\u2019s already forgotten all about it.\n*\n\n3 years later\n\n\u201cSorry for missing your birthday, kiddo,\u201d his dad says. The connection must be bad, because his voice comes out tinny and the line is cracking with static. \nTim puts the phone a bit further away from his ear and says, \u201cNo problem, Dad.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll celebrate when we\u2019re back, scout\u2019s honour,\u201d his dad says. In the background, Tim can hear his mom say: \u201cYou were never a boy scout, Jack.\u201d\nHis dad, mock-offended, says, \u201cOnly because I was busy with soccer practice. Do you know how much of my time that took up? Tim, are you on the soccer team yet?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Jack sounds disappointed, and Tim\u2019s stomach sinks. \n\u201cI\u2019ll try out, though,\u201d he hastens to add. \u201cThey\u2019ll hold try-outs when school starts again. I\u2019ll do my best to get in.\u201d\n\u201cYou do that,\u201d his dad says, while his mom, a bit clearer now as she must get closer to the phone, tells him, \u201cThere\u2019s no point in doing your best if you can\u2019t get in. Either make sure that you do get accepted, or don\u2019t try out at all.\u201d\n\u201cYes, Mom,\u201d Tim says, but he gets drowned out by his dad telling his mom an anecdote about his own team try-outs back in the day. Halfway through the story, the phone call abruptly ends. Connectivity issues, Tim tells himself, because the alternative is that they hung up on him without even saying goodbye, and he doesn\u2019t want to think about that. They didn\u2019t tell him happy birthday, either, but that\u2019s fine. He knows they\u2019re busy. He\u2019ll see them next month, probably, and they\u2019ll celebrate when they return, and he\u2019ll feel bad that he ever doubted them in the first place.\nFor now, he should be happy with what he has. And what he has is more than enough. He has a camera, he has two functioning legs, he\u2019s got the bus schedule and a map of Gotham safely stored in his backpack, and, most importantly, he has time, due to his parents cancelling their trip home last-minute. Tim is going out tonight to watch Batman and Robin, and that\u2019s better than any birthday present his parents could have gotten him, anyway. \nIt's a warm night in July, and a rare cloudless one, too. Even the ever-present smog has cleared for once, at least a little bit. Tim thinks he can see a few stars, maybe, if he squints. He stares at the sky the entire time it takes him to get to the bus station which, because the infrastructure in Gotham is terrible and Bristol is even worse, takes a while. He walks past the Wayne estate, smiling to himself when he sees that the lights are already out. Mr Wayne and Jason will be changing into Batman and Robin by now, and soon, they\u2019ll be out on the streets. \nBy the time he\u2019s climbed the roof of one of the less savoury buildings in Crime Alley, the moon is right above him. Tim frowns a little at that. Batman operates in the shadows, everyone knows that. He hopes this won\u2019t hinder him. \nIt\u2019s been a long time since Tim was first out here. The memory makes him cringe in embarrassment these days. He\u2019d just turned seven, he hadn\u2019t seen his parents in weeks, and everything had just felt like so much, suddenly. But, really, none of that excuses what he\u2019d done next. In retrospect, Tim can\u2019t believe he really thought setting something this small on fire would have been enough to get Batman\u2019s attention. A trashcan, really? It should have been a car, maybe, or even a house. (An abandoned one, of course. Tim isn\u2019t a monster.) \nIt's entirely clear to him now why Robin refused to let him speak to Batman. It\u2019s like with his mom and dad. They\u2019re busy people, with their company and their digs and their social life, and nobody could ever just call them, they have to talk to a secretary first, and then that secretary decides if the matter is worth their attention. Tim himself has been turned away at least half the times he\u2019s called, so really, he should not have been surprised that Robin turned him away, too. It\u2019d been ridiculous to expect otherwise, especially for something as small as this. \nHe checks his watch. Batman should be going past this building any minute now. Tim gets his camera, waits \u2013 and waits. \nNothing. \nHe frowns. Batman must have gotten held up. Nothing to worry over, but it\u2019s a little annoying. If he had picked one of the first streets of tonight\u2019s patrol route, he would have seen them by now, but he specifically wanted it to be this one. This is a particularly bad part of town, even for Crime Alley standards. Some action is bound to happen here tonight. \nThere\u2019s nothing to do but wait. Tim pours himself a cup of tea from the thermos he brought, checks his watch one more time, and looks up at the stars again. \nOf course, he thinks, back when he\u2019d first been here, he\u2019d still been, like, ninety per cent sure that Batman would take one look at him and swallow him whole, like his mom had said he would. At seven, Tim had just been old enough to still believe that. \nThat\u2019s another thing he\u2019s learned. Batman doesn\u2019t eat children, of course he doesn\u2019t. Sometimes, he adopts them, even. This, even seven-year-old Tim had known, and it had been the ten per cent that had convinced him to light a fire that night. \nThese days, he\u2019s ninety-nine per cent certain that Batman wouldn\u2019t harm kids, ever. \nRegretfully, he\u2019s also realised that Batman doesn\u2019t just randomly take in every kid he meets, either. There must be something special about the ones he does adopt, Tim knows. He\u2019s spent hours studying this. Dick Grayson had been an orphan, just like Bruce Wayne. Jason Todd, too, had been orphaned. So, that\u2019s apparently one requirement. There is, maybe, also the aspect of family wealth. Neither the Graysons nor the Todds had been wealthy. They had left their sons without any means to support themselves. Mr Wayne, meanwhile, had had every means. So that\u2019s another requirement. \nAs neither an orphan nor poor, Tim obviously does not qualify, he realises this now. \nIt's alright, really. He\u2019s made his peace with the fact that he won\u2019t ever interact with his heroes. It\u2019s better if he doesn\u2019t, anyway. The first and last time he tried, Dick Grayson lied to his face and tried to rat him out to his parents. Tim doesn\u2019t intend to find out if Jason Todd would be more sympathetic. \nAnd besides \u2013 there\u2019s still, well. \nThere\u2019s still just a little bit of fear left from the hundreds of times his parents used Batman as a threat. As long as he is up here on a roof, watching Batman and Robin from a distance, it\u2019s perfectly fine. But just the thought of actually talking to Batman, of Batman seeing him, approaching him, makes a shiver run down his spine. At seven, Tim had been desperate enough to take his chances. At ten, Tim has learned his lesson. \nSo, roof. Tim is fine with roof. \nAnother twenty minutes pass without anything happening. Then, finally, a noise \u2013 except that it\u2019s not coming from the street down below. It\u2019s coming from behind him. \nTim freezes. He slowly turns around, not sure what he\u2019s expecting. A criminal, definitely. Hopefully not one of the scary ones. A tiny part of him hopes that it\u2019s just someone going out for a smoke.\nWhen he sees who\u2019s standing there, only a few metres away from him, leaning against a wall, he realises that is, in fact, someone out for a smoke. Except that the person who\u2019s just lit their cigarette isn\u2019t just anyone. \nIt's Robin. \nRobin hasn\u2019t spotted him yet, but the roof isn\u2019t very big. If Tim moves, he\u2019s going to draw attention to himself. What, then? Should he just stand here and wait until Robin leaves? Except, well. This is such a great angle, and Tim\u2019s already holding his camera. It\u2019d be a shame to miss it.\nThe second the tell-tale clicking sound of a camera going off has sounded through the night, Robin is on him, holding his wrist and taking the camera away from him, the cigarette abandoned on the ground.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he demands. \u201cLooking to sell a picture of Robin smoking to the papers? Who hired you?\u201d\n\u201cNobody,\u201d Tim says quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s just me.\u201d\nAs soon as Robin hears him speak, he releases Tim, although he doesn\u2019t step away, either. Beneath the domino mask, Tim can see him frowning. \u201cHow old are you?\u201d\n\u201cFifteen.\u201d\nRobin snorts. \u201cWant to try that again?\u201d\nTim slumps. \u201cTen.\u201d \nTo his outrage, Robin snorts again. \u201cSeriously, how old?\u201d\n\u201cI told you, I\u2019m ten,\u201d Tim snaps, getting somewhat annoyed now. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not going to sell the pictures to anyone, so you can stop interrogating me.\u201d\n\u201cHuh,\u201d Robin says. \u201cAlright, shorty, I believe you. Still, it\u2019s a little past your bedtime. Do you live in this building?\u201d \n\u201cYes,\u201d Tim says quickly. \u201cI came out here because I couldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d he adds, warming up to the lie now, \u201cbut I\u2019m cold, so I\u2019m going back to bed now. Bye!\u201d He shoves the thermos into his backpack, grabs the camera from Robin, and runs down the fire escape, entering through the first door he sees, which turns out to lead into a hallway. \nFor a few seconds he just stands there, heart hammering, trying to listen for any strange noises that might indicate Robin following him. But nothing comes. He stays here for ten more minutes, just to be safe, before leaving the building and going to the next bus stop. His night\u2019s been cut short, but he can\u2019t be mad, because he got a great photo of Robin smoking, and also, in the brief conversation they did have, Jason didn\u2019t lie to him, which is more than could be said for the previous Robin. \nBriefly, Tim considers that, technically, he\u2019s the one who lied. But, he thinks, it\u2019s okay, because there was no way he could have told the truth. Lying is okay if there\u2019s no other option. And besides, after tonight, he\u2019s never ever going to speak to Robin again, so it\u2019s fine. Completely fine.\n*\nBy time school starts again in early September, Tim\u2019s parents have been back to Gotham twice, once for a weekend, once for merely twelve hours. They never did get to celebrate his birthday, but that\u2019s okay. The good thing about birthdays is that they happen every year. Maybe next year will be the one.\nAt least this means, though, that there is nobody to remind him to try out for the soccer team. Tim already has karate training two times a week after school, and krav maga on Saturdays, and he neither has time for soccer, nor is he particularly interested. He does okay in PE, but he\u2019s not a very good team player. \nSo instead of joining yet another sports club, he continues on as he always has, with school, martial arts, and night-time photography to keep him company and fill the empty hours. He\u2019s always sad when summer break ends, because he\u2019s got much less time to go out into the city at night, but he still tries to go once a week at least. If Jason can manage being Robin on top of school, Tim can manage this, too. \nIt's the second week after the break when the school closes early, an alarm shrilling through the hallways. Nobody knows what\u2019s going on, an Arkham breakout maybe \u2013 they\u2019re supposed to have a different alarm for every emergency, but that got so confusing that the school stuck to having just a universal one for everything \u2013, and Tim\u2019s class is directed by the teacher to go the gym. \nTim waits until they bypass another class in the corridor, which was bound to happen and which always makes for more chaos, to slip away. \nHe\u2019s going to come back! But his teacher hasn\u2019t taken attendance yet today, and so it will take her a while to figure out who\u2019s missing, especially because Tim called in sick with a cold yesterday. \n(He forwarded an email to the administration from his dad\u2019s account, whose password he figured out ages ago. He wasn\u2019t actually sick, but he figures that because he had a cold last year and came in to give his maths exam anyway, he\u2019s owed this.) \nSo, yeah, Tim is definitely planning to return to his class at some point. But for now, he wants to figure out what\u2019s actually going on, since nobody is telling them.\nHe goes to the administration office first, which is empty, since the mass-evacuation includes staff. Good. Tim\u2019s phone doesn\u2019t have reception in school, and it would take way too long to hack the school from one of the computers in the library, but doing it from their own computer is simple enough. \nHe's only just logged in when there\u2019s a pointed cough. Shit, Tim thinks, but it\u2019s too late to cover his tracks. If this is a disgruntled school official, it\u2019s going to be hard getting out of this. \nExcept that when he looks up, it\u2019s Jason. Not Robin, but Jason Todd, wearing his Gotham Academy uniform and a scowl to boot. \u201cWhat are you doing? Why aren\u2019t you outside?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m hacking the school,\u201d Tim tells him. \u201cDid you know that there\u2019s a protocol for situations like this? While evacuation is ongoing, the administrator has to register the reason for it, unless it\u2019s, like, a life or death situation. I\u2019m just checking what they put down.\u201d\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d Jason says. \u201cStill, I think you should probably leave now. Might be dangerous here.\u201d\n\u201cProbably not,\u201d Tim says absently as he opens the right file. \u201cLast year, the alarm rang, like, twenty-six times. That\u2019s one every week of the school year. I think the only serious one was- oh, here we go. See, I told you.\u201d He angles the screen so that Jason can take a look, too.\n\u201cPossibly magic-related crocodile infestation in the sewers,\u201d Jason reads out loud. \u201cHuh, alright. Not that serious.\u201d\n\u201cI told you,\u201d Tim repeats. He logs out, shuts down the computer, and gets off the chair. \u201cWe can go now,\u201d he tells Jason graciously. \nWhen Jason only stares at him for a second, Tim abruptly remembers that they are, technically, strangers to each other. Whether Jason recognises him or not (probably not, he thinks, since their encounter was seven weeks ago, at night, in a completely different setting), he definitely thinks that Tim doesn\u2019t know who he is. Tim takes the weird staring-second to think about what information Timothy Drake, grade five, future heir to Drake Industries, would reasonably have about Jason Todd, newly adopted son of Bruce Wayne. \nName, yes, school, yes, grade, maybe, family, yes, details of personal life, no. Alright. He can work with that.\n\u201cI\u2019m Tim, by the way,\u201d he says, holding out his hand in a formal manner. \n\u201cJason,\u201d Jason says, shaking it and shaking his head, too, like he\u2019s dismissing whatever thought had been keeping him occupied just now. \u201cLet\u2019s go, then. I think everybody is down at the gym.\u201d\n\u201cWhat were you doing up here?\u201d Tim asks while they navigate Gotham Academy\u2019s many hallways, which by now are mostly vacated. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you outside?\u201d\nIt's curiosity that\u2019s making him ask, coupled with the smug knowledge that he\u2019s allowed to pose the question at all, since Timothy Drake doesn\u2019t know much about Jason Todd and would reasonably be wondering why he\u2019s not with his class. \nJason shrugs. \u201cI was in the bathroom when the alarm started. When I got back to my classroom, everyone was gone, so I went up to the office, to see if there was anyone here who could help me find my class.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a good story, Tim thinks. It makes sense, and the casual way with which Jason told it is completely believable, as well. He also thinks that this probably doesn\u2019t count as Robin lying to him, since Jason is not dressed as Robin right now.\nThey walk in silence for a while, until they reach the first floor. The gym is just outside, only a two-minute walk away now. \n\u201cYou weren\u2019t scared,\u201d Jason suddenly says, holding the massive front doors open for Tim. \n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t know about the crocodile thing when you walked up there.\u201d\n\u201cProbability dictates-\u201c\n\u201cYeah, but I joined this school last year. I might not have been here long enough to know every alarm, but I was here for at least half of those you mentioned. And I know for a fact that there were a few serious ones there, too. There was, what, a twenty per cent chance that this was serious, is that right?\u201d\nTim nods, surprised. \n\u201cAnd you still you weren\u2019t scared? Not even a little bit?\u201d \nThis time, Tim is the one who shrugs. \u201cI grew up in Gotham. And you weren\u2019t scared, either.\u201d \n\u201cYeah, but I\u2019m-\u201c Jason stops. \u201cOlder,\u201d he says, after a split-second pause that Tim thinks he would have missed if he hadn\u2019t been listening so intently. \u201cAnd bigger.\u201d Jason smirks. \u201cMuch bigger. Scarier, too, I bet. If those crocodiles infested the school, they wouldn\u2019t dare touch me, but you know who\u2019d be a great mid-morning snack for them? You.\u201d\n\u201cHey!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault you\u2019re bite-sized!\u201d\n\u201cIf crocodiles do infest the school,\u201d Tim says firmly, \u201cI\u2019d deal with it. I can take care of myself.\u201d\nJason\u2019s smile is rueful when he says, \u201cNot waiting for Batman and Robin to protect you?\u201d\nTim hesitates, easy banter giving way to something else, a fear that\u2019d been instilled in him since he could think. He knows Batman would protect him, it\u2019s literally his job. But he\u2019d much rather know in theory than find out in reality if Batman\u2019s protection of Gotham extends to a kid like him. \n\u201cNot really,\u201d he tells Jason. \u201cNot if I can do it without anyone\u2019s help.\u201d\nTo his surprise, Jason claps him on the shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s good thinking, Timmy. Never rely on a guy dressed like a bat to save you, you hear me? Robin though \u2013 I think it\u2019s safe to say that you can trust Robin.\u201d He winks. \nBefore Tim can think of a witty reply, they arrive at the gym, where Jason\u2019s teacher, undoubtedly frantic about losing the Wayne heir, corners him immediately, and Tim is able to slip away unnoticed.\n*\nTwo months into the school year, Tim\u2019s caught up with enough of his work that for an entire glorious week, he\u2019s able to go out every single night. He watches Batman and Robin arrest dozens of criminals, he takes photos of all of it, and, perhaps most importantly, he takes photos of what happens after, too. At the end of patrol, Batman will tell Robin what a good job he did, or he\u2019ll ruffle his hair, or he\u2019ll even take him out for three am milkshakes. \nTim watches this, too, and he yearns. In moments like these, he doesn\u2019t understand how his parents could ever use Batman to scare him as a child. Who would be scared of a man who asks his son if he wants to get a Batburger before going home? \nBy the end of the week, Tim is so tired that he thinks he could fall asleep standing, and he still feels like that on Monday morning, when the first Autumn storm of the year is brewing on the horizon. He considers calling in sick, but he can\u2019t take too many sick days before the school gets suspicious, and it's only eight or so hours, anyway. He\u2019ll go to his lessons, have a good long sleep tonight, and be right as rain tomorrow. \nSpeaking of rain.\nIt\u2019s drizzling a little when he leaves the house, but the walk to the bus stop is long, and by the time he\u2019s walking past the Wayne estate, the light drizzle has turned into heavy rain. Tim pulls his coat tighter around himself and hopes that the bus won\u2019t be held up by the weather. \nSuddenly, there\u2019s the sound of a car honk nearby, once, twice. A car has pulled up next to him, black and sleek, and the window slides down before Tim can make up his mind to run or call for help. \nInstead of a paedophile, it\u2019s Mr Pennyworth, his old, kind face frowning. \u201cDreadful weather we\u2019re having today. May I offer you a ride?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s alright,\u201d Tim says, shaking his head. \u201cI\u2019ll just take the bus.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve got somebody here with me who insists,\u201d Mr Pennyworth says, and then a second window rolls down, this one in the back, and Jason sticks his head out.\n\u201cCome on, get in! We\u2019re going the same way, it\u2019d be crazy to leave you out here.\u201d\nFaced with this much well-meaning insistence, all Tim can offer up in protest is a weak, \u201cI don\u2019t want to get your seats wet.\u201d\n\u201cI can assure you that those seats have seen much worse,\u201d Mr Pennyworth tells him as he gets out and opens a door, even if that means he, too, is now standing in the pouring rain. \nTim thinks that, actually, this is a valid argument. Objectively speaking, water is much better than blood, and also Mr Pennyworth is getting wet now, too, all because Tim can\u2019t make up his mind. \nHe gets in. \n\u201cIs your chauffeur indisposed, Master Drake?\u201d Mr Pennyworth asks when they\u2019re on the road again, this time with an additional passenger. \n\u201cWe don\u2019t have one,\u201d Tim says. \u201cMy parents like to keep the staff to a minimum, and I don\u2019t mind taking the bus.\u201d\n\u201cDuring a storm?\u201d Jason asks sceptically. As if to highlight his words, there\u2019s a lightning strike just as he's finished speaking, followed by thunder. \u201cCouldn\u2019t they drive you at least?\u201d\nTim knows where this is going, and he\u2019s going to put a stop to it before it can escalate. \u201cThey\u2019re busy with work. Drake Industries employs hundreds of people, and taking time off isn\u2019t always as easy as they\u2019d like. It\u2019s no trouble taking the bus if it means five hundred people receive their paycheck. Anything else would be selfish.\u201d\nIt is, almost word for word, what his mom has told him countless times when he was younger and hadn\u2019t yet learned which things are acceptable to ask of his parents, and which aren\u2019t.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Jason says after a pause (Tim has no idea how much time actually passed, since the warmth of the car and the soothing rumble of the engine have him fight not to fall asleep), \u201cyou know what else would be selfish? Not giving a ride to our next-door neighbour when we literally go the same way every day.\u201d\nTim\u2019s tired mind is having trouble processing this. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI believe Master Jason is offering to make today\u2019s situation a regular occurrence,\u201d Mr Pennyworth says, eyes fixed on the road as he switches lanes. \u201cI\u2019m inclined to agree with him.\u201d\nThat\u2019s enough to snap Tim out of his fatigue. \u201cYou really don\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\u201cWe really do,\u201d Jason argues. \u201cActually, we should have done this much earlier, as soon as I realised that you live next-door. I told Dick about the kid who was hacking the school during an evac, and when I told him your name, he asked if I meant Timothy Montgomery or Timothy Hendrix or Timothy Drake, and I said I had no idea, but I told him what you look like, and he remembered you from a few galas. He says to tell you hi.\u201d\n\u201cUm,\u201d Tim says dumbly. \u201cHi?\u201d\n\u201cSo it\u2019s settled then,\u201d Jason says, leaning back in his seat in obvious satisfaction. \u201cGive me your number, I\u2019ll text you tomorrow when we\u2019re outside your house. Hey, are you okay? You look tired.\u201d\n\u201cLate night,\u201d Tim mutters while he enters his number into Jason\u2019s phone. \nJason frowns, but doesn\u2019t get the chance to question him further, because at this moment Alfred pulls up outside the school gates. Tim thanks them both for the ride, gets out and immediately attaches himself to a group of classmates whose parents dropped them off at the same time, all to avoid further interaction with his unexpected benefactor. His classmates look bemused, but easily include him in their conversation, and Tim has long since congratulated himself on his quick thinking by the time the end of the school day comes around, and he steps outside his classroom to find Jason waiting for him. \n\u201cThought we\u2019d go meet Alfred together,\u201d he says, falling into step besides Tim. \u201cWouldn\u2019t want you to get lost and end up at the bus stop instead.\u201d\n\u201cYou seriously don\u2019t have to do this,\u201d Tim says. \u201cI don\u2019t need-\u201c His words get cut off when he almost walks into a set of glass doors, held back only because of Jason\u2019s quick reflexes. He blinks. Were those doors there that whole time? \n\u201cChrist,\u201d Jason says, \u201cI\u2019m starting to think your night wasn\u2019t just late, but that it stood you up altogether. Did you sleep at all?\u201d\n\u201cI kept nodding off during English Lit.\u201d\nJason\u2019s look of open-mouthed shock would be funny if Tim wasn\u2019t feeling dead on his feet right now. \u201cYou- what- during- why?\u201d\nLetting Jason hold the glass doors open so he can pass through like a normal person instead of attempting to walk through matter, Tim says, \u201cWe\u2019re reading A Wrinkle in Time. But I already looked it up on Wikipedia, so.\u201d He yawns. \nThe storm has passed when they walk outside, but there is an entirely different storm brewing on Jason\u2019s face as he evidently tries to process this. \u201cBut \u2013 reading is fun. \u2013 Hold up, kiddo. Alfred\u2019s waiting over there.\u201d To Tim\u2019s utter mortification, he uses the straps of Tim\u2019s backpack to pull him back from where he\u2019d been using Jason\u2019s distraction to subtly slink away to the bus stop. \nThe first thing Jason does once they\u2019re in the car is say, accusation clear in his voice, \u201cTim fell asleep in class today.\u201d\nTim whips his head around so fast that the seatbelt strains against his chest. \u201cDid you just tell on me?\u201d\nAlfred, coming to a stop at a red light, says serenely, \u201cWould you perhaps like to come home with us, Master Tim, to use your afternoon to catch up on sleep?\u201d\n\u201cUm,\u201d Tim says, \u201cum, no, thank you. That\u2019s okay.\u201d\nJason starts protesting, but Tim leans his head against the window, watching the rain start up again. He'll just close his eyes for a moment, he thinks. Just one second, and then he\u2019ll tell Jason why, exactly, it\u2019d be super weird if he came to the Wayne estate to sleep when his own house is literally only a mile away. One second.\n*\n\u201cJason, have you seen my- who\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u201cThat, sir, is Timothy Drake, heir to Drake Industries and, I believe, your next-door neighbour.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what is he doing on my couch?\u201d\n\u201cMaster Jason, realising the little distance between our respective houses, offered him a ride to and from school. A permanent offer. Following this, we-\u201c\n\u201cBruce, he fell asleep. What were we supposed to do, throw him out of a moving car?\u201d\n\u201cI see. So, instead, you chose to let him sleep, then carried him inside a house he\u2019s never been to before and will not recognise upon waking up, with mostly unfamiliar faces surrounding him?\u201d \n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cJay, do you realise that most people would call that kidnapping?\u201d\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re not one to ta- oh, hey, I think he\u2019s waking up.\u201d\n*\nTim wakes up to three faces peering down at him. He recognises Robin \u2013 wait, no, Jason, his mind supplies \u2013, and Mr Pennyworth, and\u2026\nHe flinches back into the cushions (cushions?) before he can stop himself, feeling the blood drain from his face. He has no idea where he is, or how he got here, but it must be pretty bad if Batman is here. Has Batman found out that Tim got a ride home instead of taking the bus like usual? Is he here to give Tim a lesson? \nThen Batman asks, \u201cHow are you feeling, chum?\u201d, and Tim\u2019s mind blanks, goes offline and reboots, all in the blink of an eye. \nOh, right, he thinks. This isn\u2019t Batman, it\u2019s Mr Wayne, and he\u2019s here because this, by the looks of it, is his house. Which leaves the question of why Tim is in his house.\n\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d he says, sitting up. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\u201cYou fell asleep, so we brought you here,\u201d Jason supplies helpfully. \u201cYou can stay for dinner, right, Alfred?\u201d\nTim doesn\u2019t get the chance to think of an excuse because Alfred is already doing it for him. \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ve kept Master Tim long enough already. No doubt his parents are expecting him.\u201d\n\u201cThey are,\u201d Tim hastens to say. \u201cThey must be wondering where I am.\u201d\n\u201cIn that case,\u201d Mr Wayne says smoothly, \u201cwhy don\u2019t I call them? I believe I\u2019ve got their contact information here somewhere\u2026.Alfred, we have the Drakes\u2019 number, right?\u201d\nAlfred nods his confirmation, but Tim isn\u2019t listening, his tired mind suddenly wide awake and alert. There is, right now, almost nothing that would be worse than Mr Wayne trying to call his mom and dad, for so many reasons. \u201cThat\u2019s not necessary! It\u2019s not a long walk to my house. I\u2019ll just tell them myself when I\u2019m home.\u201d\nMr Wayne raises his arm, and Tim flinches again, but it turns out that he only did it to wrap an arm around Jason\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIf that\u2019s what you want,\u201d he says, his face betraying nothing of what he\u2019s thinking. \u201cBut there is no need to walk. Alfred will drive you.\u201d\nTim, heart still racing, is, abruptly and yet ultimately, done. This day has been an emotional rollercoaster, and he thinks that if he has to accept yet another ride from one of the Waynes today, he\u2019s going to lose it. \nPushing himself up off the couch, he straightens up and says formally, \u201cI prefer to walk, but thank you for offering, and thanks for earlier, too. I\u2019m sure my parents will be pleased to hear that you helped me out.\u201d \nLooking bemused, Mr Wayne says, \u201cNo problem. Are you sure you don\u2019t want-\u201c\n\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d Tim interrupts. \u201cI really have to go now, though, I don\u2019t want my parents to worry. Bye, Mr Wayne \u2013 Mr Pennyworth \u2013 I\u2019ll see you around, Jason.\u201d \nLater, when he\u2019s back in his empty house, he thinks how nice his lie was, how much better it is than real life. It would be nice to know that his parents really were worried about him coming home late, to know that they\u2019ve kept dinner warm for him, that they called him, even, to see where he is and what\u2019s keeping him. \nHe thinks it\u2019s what Mr Wayne would have done, had Jason gone missing.\n*\nThe rides to school become a daily occurrence, if only because Jason and Mr Pennyworth keep showing up at his house and it would be rude to let them make the drive for nothing. At least Tim was able to put his foot down when it comes to the ride back \u2013 he may have exaggerated the number of times he has karate practice, but it is true, at least, that when he does, he takes the bus into a sports centre in Gotham instead of going straight home.\nStill, though, he now starts every morning with being in the same car with Robin. On the one hand, this is exciting, and sometimes, Tim has to force himself not to beam at Jason. On the other hand, this means he now has to lie to Robin, like, a lot.\nFor some reason, Jason has started to ask about his parents. Just little remarks or questions, like asking if they made Tim homecooked lunch today, or if they\u2019re going to parent-teacher night next week, or saying how weird it is that Jason\u2019s never seen their car in the driveway. Tim comes up with answers to all of them (he buys lunch at school, his parents get updates on his performance in school every month via email and don\u2019t need an additional meeting about it, they have a garage), and most of it is the truth, but it still grates on him. \nBesides, there are the times when he really does have to lie.\n\u201cWant to go to my house after school later?\u201d Jason asks once Alfred has dropped them both off in front of the school gates. \u201cWe can play video games.\u201d\n\u201cUm,\u201d Tim says, conflicted. \n\u201cCome on, it\u2019ll be great! Bruce is even home today, so he can call your parents and ask if you can stay for dinner. They won\u2019t say no if he\u2019s the one asking.\u201d\nTim, because he sucks and has yet not been able to rid himself off the reflex, pales at the mention of Mr Wayne. \nHe knows Mr Wayne only beats people up at night and in costume, but he\u2019s also really big, and last week, it was him driving them to school and not Mr Pennyworth because he had an early meeting and was going into town anyway, and when he waved them goodbye, his muscles strained his suit so much that a button popped.\nTim only weighs sixty pounds. Karate lessons or not, there is no way he\u2019d be able to defend himself against that. \n\u201cI\u2019m busy,\u201d he says quickly. \u201cMy parents are home early today, and we\u2019re going to the cinema.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Jason says, disappointed. \u201cWhich movie?\u201d\nDamn, Tim thinks. This is why he usually thinks more carefully about his lies beforehand. Improvisation only works when there are no follow-up questions. \u201cI\u2019m not sure yet, I think we\u2019re going to decide when we\u2019re there.\u201d \n\u201cWell, you better tell me all about it tomorrow,\u201d Jason says. \u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to drag Bruce to the movies with me, anyway.\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Tim promises, and spends his afternoon googling the plots of every single movie that\u2019s in the cinema right now.\nSo, those are the downsides to his new morning routine. But while he does feel bad about all the stories he\u2019s forced to make up about his family life, he can\u2019t deny that it\u2019s kind of nice to have someone to talk to every day. One time, Mr Pennyworth even made him a packed lunch, and although Tim ended up having an allergic reaction to the sandwich spread and had to go to the nurse, it was still the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to him. \nWell, the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to him during the day. His nights are still very much occupied with stalking Batman and Robin. \nThe nights have been getting colder, but Tim has used his credit card to buy himself a new, sturdier coat, and he\u2019s bundled up in it now, perched on the roof with his camera as he waits for Batman and Robin to show. It\u2019s Christmas next week. School ended today, which means that he can now spend every single night out here. It\u2019s the best present ever, and he sorely needs it, because this morning, his parents\u2019 secretary emailed to inform him that they changed their flights to February. \nThe last time Tim saw them was in August. It's the longest they\u2019ve ever been away from Gotham, and if he thinks about it too much, he\u2019s going to cry, which he\u2019s way too old to do. It\u2019s much better to just be out here, doing what he loves and pushing every thought of his parents to the back of his mind.\nHe's lucky tonight: Batman and Robin come right on time, and he gets to watch them stop a robbery. Tim takes pictures until his fingers are numb, lowering the camera when finally, Batman claps Robin on the shoulder and tells him good job. Tim\u2019s too far away to hear Robin\u2019s reply, but he can see him beaming. \nHe watches them split up \u2013 it\u2019s freezing tonight, and they probably want to be done soon, so splitting up their patrol route makes sense. Tim packs up his stuff. He thinks he\u2019s going to call it a night. He\u2019ll be back tomorrow, anyway. \n\u201cIt\u2019s you again.\u201d\n\u201cRobin,\u201d Tim says nonsensically, as Robin lands on the roof, coming to a stop right in front of him. \n\u201cWant to explain what you\u2019re doing out here in the middle of the night?\u201d Robin snaps, anger radiating off him in waves. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be-\u201c\n\u201cRobin,\u201d Tim interrupts, more firmly this time. \u201cLong time no see.\u201d\nThat makes Robin shut up as he stares at Tim, face red beneath the domino mask. It takes him a second before he says: \u201cI was really hoping I wouldn\u2019t see you up here again.\u201d\nThey\u2019ve narrowly avoided what surely would have turned into a disaster, Tim thinks, relieved. Had Jason let slip that he knows Tim beyond their brief rooftop encounter all those months ago, there would have been no coming back from that.\n\u201cI told you,\u201d he says, \u201cI come out here when I can\u2019t sleep.\u201d\n\u201cYou also told me you live in this building,\u201d Robin points out, and for a second Tim thinks he\u2019s close to blowing his cover again, but then he adds, \u201cbut I looked at the list of residents, and there was no mention of a child living here.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe the list isn\u2019t up to date,\u201d Tim says, even as his mind is already trying to come up with a way to get out of this. \nRobin snorts. \u201cReally?\u201d\nSometimes, Tim thinks, the best cover story is rooted in truth. \u201cAlright,\u201d he says, allowing himself to slump a little, \u201cso I don\u2019t really live here. But I wasn\u2019t lying about the rest. I really do come out here when I can\u2019t sleep.\u201d Can\u2019t, won\u2019t, it\u2019s the same thing, basically. \n\u201cAnd how do your parents feel about that?\u201d\nThis time, Tim doesn\u2019t even have to fake the dejection in his voice. \u201cThey don\u2019t know. Please don\u2019t tell them.\u201d\n\u201cGive me one reason why I shouldn\u2019t.\u201d\nThis is it, Tim thinks, this is what\u2019s going to make or break this moment. \u201cThey can be a lot,\u201d he says, \u201cand I don\u2019t want to worry them.\u201d Both technically true, but missing the crucial information that even if Robin would try to talk to his parents right this minute, he wouldn\u2019t find them. They\u2019re in Namibia. But Robin doesn\u2019t know that, and if Tim has any say in the matter, he never will.\nRobin, undoubtedly sympathetic to the difficult nature of parental figures, says, \u201cFine. But I can\u2019t just let you go out here again.\u201d\n\u201cAfter tonight, you\u2019ll never see me again,\u201d Tim promises. And because Robin looks unconvinced, and he really, really needs this to work out, he says the one thing that weeks upon weeks of daily rides to school and daily discussions about how he\u2019s getting home later have convinced him will always work. He says, \u201cListen, if it\u2019s not too much trouble, could you maybe help me get home?\u201d\nHe's won. Jason, straightening up and taking out his grapple gun, nods. \u201cNever too much trouble to help someone out. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll make sure you get home safe.\u201d\nIs this taking advantage, Tim wonders, clinging to Robin while they fly from roof to roof. It\u2019s not, he decides eventually, when he\u2019s already lying in bed. Jason offered a million times, and Tim merely took him up on it. Sure, Robin doesn\u2019t realise that Tim knows who he is, but an offer is an offer, and also, it was all worth it for the exhilarating rush of happiness he felt when they were flying through Gotham at night. That, Tim thinks, would be worth anything.\n*\nChristmas passes in a blur of loneliness, another one for the collection. Tim attempts to make hot chocolate and burns the pot so badly that he has to throw it away afterwards. His parents call a record-breaking four times over the holidays; he thinks they feel bad for leaving him alone. Not that they need to, he knows how busy they are. \nHe spends the entire January doing three things: stalking Batman and Robin, doing his best that Batman and Robin don\u2019t spot him so he doesn\u2019t have to break his promise, and bracing himself for the inevitable news that his parents have postponed their flight again.\nBut to his surprise, by the time February comes, there has been no talk of cancellation, and finally, on February 3rd, his parents return to Gotham. \n\u201cAnd I\u2019m going to show them the art project that I made, and my dad promised to take me to a soccer game, and my mom measured me this morning and I\u2019ve grown a whole inch since last summer,\u201d he tells Jason the morning after their return, unable to keep the pride from his voice. He was able to hold back while they were in the car, not wanting to talk Mr Pennyworth\u2019s ear off, but now that they\u2019re entering the school\u2019s main building, he has to tell someone or he\u2019ll explode.\nHe\u2019s about to launch into a story about the nice restaurant his parents took him to yesterday after they got home from the airport, when he sees the weird look Jason is giving him. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cHow long were your parents on that trip exactly?\u201d Jason asks. \n\u201cNot long,\u201d Tim says immediately. \u201cI\u2019m just happy that they\u2019re back. By the way, you don\u2019t have to give me a ride tomorrow! My dad promised to drive me.\u201d He\u2019s off before Jason can ask any more questions.\nHis dad really did promise to drive him, and he does so every day for the following week. Tim sees Jason in the hallways a couple of times, but their grades eat lunch during different periods, so it\u2019s not that often. Tim finds that he misses their morning talks, even if he never quite got over the sensation that he\u2019s inconveniencing both Jason and Mr Pennyworth somehow, but having his dad drive him is good, too. \nAnd then on Friday, two days before his parents are scheduled to fly out again, Jack wanders into the kitchen where Tim is eating a bowl of cereal, rubs the back of his neck and awkwardly says, \u201cJust got a phone call from Georgie. He said that-\u201c\n\u201cYou have to leave,\u201d Tim says, heart sinking. \u201cWhen?\u201d\n\u201cYour mom is already packing. Our flight isn\u2019t until this afternoon, but we have a business lunch first with- it doesn\u2019t matter, I know kids don\u2019t care about that kind of stuff. But, hey, I guess you\u2019re looking forward to being on your own again, eh? Got this whole big house all to yourself, bet you can\u2019t wait for your parents to get out of here.\u201d His dad laughs. \u201cLike, what\u2019s that movie called? Home Alone. Living the dream.\u201d\nTim forces himself to laugh, too, because it\u2019s expected. He doesn\u2019t point out that Home Alone ends with the kid realising he misses his family, and he doesn\u2019t remind his dad that he was going to give him a ride and that by now, he\u2019s already missed the bus. It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s all fine. He can walk. If he leaves right now and walks really fast, he might still be able to make it just in time.\nExcept that when he\u2019s outside, there\u2019s a heavy snowfall, winter rebelling one last time against the oncoming spring, and it\u2019s hard bracing himself against the harsh wind. Tim readjusts his hood, takes a moment to mourn the fact that he forgot his hat, and keeps walking. He\u2019s going to miss the first bell, but he should make it to second period at least.\nThe snowfall is so heavy by now that he can barely see the road. Just once, a car drives past him, close enough for him to recognise it as his dad\u2019s BMW. For one blissful second, he thinks that his dad remembered, that he\u2019s picking him up after all, but then the car drives on, and he realises that it must be his parents on their way to the business lunch. \nSome indeterminate time later, every step feels like a chore, and he\u2019s just started to think that maybe he should just turn around, when he sees headlights. A car approaching, another one, coming from the opposite direction. Tim steps out of the way, or at least to what he thinks is out of the way, but the car doesn\u2019t drive past, instead coming to a stop.\n\u201cDad?\u201d Tim asks, but his teeth are chattering so much that he\u2019s not sure his dad understands him, until-\n\u201cNot quite.\u201d Strong arms left him up, brush snow off his face and coat. \n\u201cOh,\u201d Tim mutters, only to be answered by a laugh. \n\u201cSounding a bit disappointed there, kiddo,\u201d the person says. That sentence nudges something in Tim\u2019s memory, sluggish though his mind feels right now. \u201cDick,\u201d he mutters, and the arms around him tighten briefly. \n\u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019m just going to get you into the backseat and then we\u2019ll be off, okay?\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d Tim shouts, or at least attempts to. His fingers feel numb, but he still tries to push himself outside of Dick Grayson\u2019s grip. \u201cYou can\u2019t! You promised.\u201d\n\u201cPromised what?\u201d Dick asks as he gently drops him inside the car, doing up the seatbelt for him. \nTim has never been this cold in his life, and it\u2019s hard to think, but this is important. \u201cYou told me,\u201d he mutters even as he\u2019s falling asleep, \u201cyou promised I could talk to Batman. You lied to me.\u201d His lips have gone so numb that he can barely understand himself, but as his eyes close for the final time, he\u2019s way past the point of caring.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Tim has woken up in a strange place that a quick look around identifies as one of the living rooms in Wayne Manor, but it\u2019s the first time he does so while straddled in a mount of blankets, all while someone is noisily eating a bag of chips in his general vicinity.\n\u201cHey, you\u2019re up,\u201d Dick Grayson says, smiling at him from where he\u2019s sitting next to him on the couch. \u201cYou were out for so long, I was beginning to get a little worried. Potato chip?\u201d\n\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d\n\u201cSuit yourself.\u201d Dick eats two more chips, swallows, and says, \u201cBefore you freak out \u2013 I know it\u2019s been a while since my last gala, but just in case you don\u2019t remember me, I\u2019m-\u201c\n\u201cDick Grayson. You were in the car that stopped when you saw me.\u201d\nDick smiles. He, too, is covered with a blanket. \u201cGot it in one. Do you remember how we met?\u201d\nIt's a trap, Tim thinks suddenly. There is no way Dick can be referring to what Tim thinks he\u2019s referring to. Maybe he\u2019s just checking if Tim has amnesia. (He doesn\u2019t. He\u2019s really, really cold, but he can remember everything that happened today all the way until that car pulled up, and he can guess the rest: Dick must have seen him, recognised him as Jack and Janet Drake\u2019s kid, realised he was in danger of getting frostbite, and brought him to the next-best place, which is Wayne Manor. It doesn\u2019t take a genius to figure that out.)\nBut the way Dick\u2019s smile is just slightly uneasy makes Tim think that maybe Dick doesn\u2019t mean the first time they met at a gala a couple of years ago. Which leaves-\n\u201cThat night at the circus.\u201d\nDick pales, and Tim has just enough time to curse himself before he says, \u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Tim hastens to say. He attempts to hold up both hands in a gesture of submission, but he\u2019s been wrapped so firmly in the blanket cocoon that he can only move his head. \u201cForget it.\u201d\n\u201cNo, go on. I was sure we\u2019d met at a charity event,\u201d Dick says, smile tight, tight, tight, \u201cbut I\u2019ll happily stand corrected.\u201d\nThere\u2019s no good way to talk himself out of this, so Tim settles on the truth. \u201cMy parents took me to the circus a few years ago,\u201d he says quietly, almost whispers it, like a confession. \u201cYou told me you were going to do a flip just for me.\u201d\nDick looks like he\u2019s been slapped. \u201cI don\u2019t remember that,\u201d he says.\nTim shrugs. \u201cThat\u2019s okay. I\u2019m sure you met a hundred kids every day.\u201d He doesn\u2019t tell Dick that they met the night the Graysons fell. Dick doesn\u2019t need to know that.\n\u201cI thought-\u201c Dick says, but breaks off, shaking his head ruefully. \u201cWell, clearly I thought wrong. Now, what do you say to waiting here while I sneak down to the kitchen and get us some hot chocolate?\u201d\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s okay,\u201d Tim says, \u201cI should probably-\u201c He is, suddenly, overcome by a horrible realisation. \u201cOh no,\u201d he whispers, \u201cI am so late to school.\u201d He\u2019s definitely missed the first few periods, maybe even the entire day \u2013 how late is it? The storm is still raging outside the window, at least.\nTo his surprise, Dick laughs. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about that one bit. I\u2019d say hypothermia is a very good reason for missing a day.\u201d\n\u201cHypothermia?\u201d\n\u201cJust a little bit. It\u2019s what all those blankets are for. When I brought you in, your lips had turned blue. You\u2019d only just stopped shivering a few minutes before you woke up.\u201d\nThis is bad, Tim thinks. He\u2019d guessed the general course of events that have led to him waking up on the Waynes\u2019 couch (again), but Dick is making it sound like something serious. But it can\u2019t be serious, because if it is, then Tim is going to have to answer questions, and that\u2019s never a good thing.\n\u201cI\u2019ll get that hot chocolate,\u201d Dick says, clapping him on the shoulder, \u201cyou just sit here and hang on tight. I\u2019ll be right back. Oh, fair warning \u2013 Alfred\u2019s out running errands right now, so it\u2019s just Bruce, Jason and me right now. I told Jason to not let Bruce anywhere near the stove, but I guess we won\u2019t know until we taste it. Be right back.\u201d He winks.\nTim, left on his own, struggles once more with the blanket cocoon. He\u2019s just managed to shrug off the first layer when the door opens again. But it\u2019s not Dick. It\u2019s Jason \u2013 and Mr Wayne.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe-\u201c Jason starts, but Bruce holds up a hand.\n\u201cLet me speak with him first. Alone, please, Jay.\u201d\nJason scowls but, faced with the calm look Mr Wayne gives him in return, nods his agreement, slamming the door behind him as he goes.\nTim, seeing Mr Wayne approach, wishes again that he wasn\u2019t effectively trapped right now. It\u2019s easy enough to think that Mr Wayne would never hurt him when he\u2019s out at night, watching Batman smile at Robin\u2019s jokes. It\u2019s another matter when they\u2019re alone in a room together, with nobody stopping Mr Wayne from doing what he wants.\n\u201cTim,\u201d Mr Wayne says, tone serious.\n\u201cMr Wayne,\u201d Tim says, his voice squeaking embarrassingly.\nMr Wayne holds up his hand again. \u201cPlease,\u201d he says, \u201ccall me Bruce.\u201d\nTim, ready to do whatever it takes to make the man back off, obediently mutters, \u201cBruce.\u201d\nThankfully, Bruce doesn\u2019t take Dick\u2019s vacated seat on the couch, instead choosing an armchair that\u2019s a fair distance away. \u201cI\u2019d like to talk to you about what happened today. Dick says he found you on the road during that storm, but what I\u2019m wondering is why you were there in the first place. Why weren\u2019t you at school?\u201d\nBruce sounds so openly disapproving that Tim\u2019s ensuing shiver has very little to do with the cold. \u201cI was on my way. I\u2019d missed the bus, so I had to walk.\u201d\n\u201cJason told me you declined to ride with him this week, because your parents would give you a lift instead. Is that not true?\u201d\n\u201cIt is!\u201d Tim says, almost yells, because he doesn\u2019t want Jason to sound like a liar. \u201cMy dad did give me a lift these last few days. It\u2019s just that he was busy today. Something came up, and when he told me, the bus had already gone.\u201d\n\u201cJust to make sure I\u2019m understanding this correctly \u2013 due to some unforeseen circumstances, your dad was unable to give you a ride today, and when you realised you\u2019d missed the bus, you decided to walk instead. Yes?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Tim says miserably. He thinks the way Bruce is phrasing it is almost making it sound like this is Tim\u2019s fault, that he shouldn\u2019t have been late for the bus. He supposes that if he\u2019d been in the kitchen a little earlier, maybe his dad could have \u2013 but no, his dad came in when Tim had already been sitting there for a while, meaning his dad only just got the call. There\u2019s nothing Tim could have done, right?\nBruce nods slowly. \u201cWas it snowing when you left?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cAnd was it snowing when your dad talked to you earlier, when he told you he couldn\u2019t drive you?\u201d\n\u201cI mean, I guess, yeah.\u201d\n\u201cSo you left the house on your own, during a snowstorm, while your dad stayed behind at home?\u201d\nTim thinks back, then shakes his head. \u201cHe didn\u2019t- it\u2019s just that my parents had to pack because they\u2019re going to the airport right after their business lunch, so they had to hurry up. But they left shortly after I did. It\u2019s not like they were making me go out into the cold to punish me or something.\u201d\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d Bruce agrees smoothly. \u201cThank you, Tim, I think that\u2019s all. Now, would you like to stay up here, or come downstairs into the kitchen with me?\u201d\nTim thinks about it. \u201cKitchen?\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s free you from those blankets, then.\u201d Bruce moves to help him, and Tim-\nTim flinches.\nBruce freezes. \u201cTim-\u201c\n\u201cSorry, you just surprised me,\u201d Tim says, taking deep breaths to calm his racing heart. This is ridiculous. He is being ridiculous. \u201cI can do it on my own.\u201d To prove his words, he shrugs off another layer, wriggles himself out of the third, and stands, free at last. Instantly, he feels cold again.\n\u201cGood job, buddy,\u201d Bruce says, but he sounds distracted, and he continues to be distracted the entire time it takes them to get downstairs which, due to the Wayne Manor being huge, takes quite a while.\nWhen they get there, Jason is holding up an iPad, reading out loud: \u201cIt says here that we need to stir the entire time, or else the milk burns-\u201c\n\u201cWe can probably just leave it for a bit,\u201d Dick says confidently. \u201cYou don\u2019t know this yet, Jay, but I\u2019ve watched Alfred make this a hundred times. I can do it in my sleep.\u201d\n\u201cThen why did you make me read the instructions to you?!\u201d\n\u201cBecause when you and Bruce were in charge, you burned the pot beyond recognition!\u201d\nTim, dazed, thinks this argument could probably go on forever. Bruce, evidently thinking the same, snaps out of whatever has occupied his thoughts these last few minutes. \u201cBoys,\u201d he calls out, in a tone that brooks no argument. Tim wraps his arms around himself and inches a bit away from him.\nDick and Jason pause for exactly two second, long enough to glance at them and wave at Tim, before Jason says, \u201cYou\u2019re burning it right now,\u201d and Dick says, \u201cit\u2019s supposed to smell like that!\u201d, and just like that, they\u2019re off again.\nBruce turns to Tim, voice long-suffering as he says, \u201cThey\u2019ll be at for a while. Can I leave you here while I make some phone calls, or would you prefer to accompany me?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll stay here,\u201d Tim says immediately. \u201cJust- actually, nevermind,\u201d he says. There\u2019s no need to dump his problems on Bruce.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Bruce asks, because of course he does.\nTim winces. \u201cJust, I missed school today, so I need to call them and- but it\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll do it myself when I get home.\u201d\n\u201cWhen will your parents be returning from their trip? If it\u2019s soon, perhaps they can handle it upon their return.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know yet,\u201d Tim says, which is true. They told him they\u2019d be back in April, but that might change.\nBruce, after a brief hesitation, says, \u201cIn that case, I\u2019ll take care of it for you. It\u2019s no trouble.\u201d\nThe thing is that Tim should really decline, but actually, Bruce handling this is way easier than the alternative, which is hiring someone to play his dad on the phone. \u201cThanks,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cThat\u2019d be great.\u201d\n\u201cNo problem,\u201d Bruce says and leaves just as the fire alarm goes off.\n*\nSeeing as this is the second time Tim has been brought to the Wayne manor without his explicit consent, he figures that he can at least take advantage of it, especially since everyone seems so insistent that he stay the night. They\u2019ve all been really nice: Dick and Jason made him play videogames with them, Alfred told him repeatedly that if he needs anything, he should just ask, and Dick added that he doesn\u2019t even have to ask, he can just take whatever. \u201cI go to the fridge late at night all the time,\u201d he says, \u201cand it\u2019s no big deal.\u201d\nAlfred presses his lips together and says nothing, and Dick, evidently taking this as permission, hugs him enthusiastically.\nSo, Tim supposes that he\u2019s just doing what Dick told him to. Yes, Dick probably meant, like, if he gets hungry or needs a towel or something, but he did say whatever. Tim explicitly heard him use that word, and he\u2019s ready to quote it in a court of law. So this means that Dick basically gave him permission to wait until everybody is in bed (or, to be more accurate, until everybody has made a great show of pretending to go to bed), then sneak out of the guest room he\u2019s been given, and go searching for Batman\u2019s secret lair.\nThis is the opportunity of a lifetime, and Tim knows he could get into serious trouble if he gets caught, but it\u2019s worth it. Besides, all he has to do is not let himself get caught, right? That\u2019s easy. He does it every night in Gotham, and so far, Robin has only spotted him twice. That\u2019s a pretty good ratio.\nHe's prepared to spend the entire night searching, but in the end, it turns out he doesn\u2019t have to. Just minutes after he\u2019s snuck out of his room, he hears footsteps. Tim presses himself flat against the wall, partially hidden by a large suit of armour that\u2019s a part of the Wayne manor hallway decoration for some reason, and doesn\u2019t dare breathe as someone walks past him. It\u2019s Jason, dressed in pyjamas. He hasn\u2019t noticed Tim.\nAt first, Tim thinks he\u2019s on his way to the bathroom, but Jason passes that door without stopping. Tim follows him quietly downstairs. Jason walks past the kitchen, too, and past several closed doors as well, until finally, he enters a living room. Tim, not wanting to give himself up, waits just outside that room for a few minutes, counting down the seconds beneath his breath. Nothing happens. Jason doesn\u2019t come back out.\nEventually, Tim peaks inside the room. It\u2019s empty. The windows are shut, there are no other exits, nor large pieces of furniture that could hide a 13-year-old boy.\nJackpot, Tim thinks.\nHe takes his time. Sure, the longer he takes, the more a risk he runs of being discovered, but that doesn\u2019t mean he shouldn\u2019t be careful. Who knows if there are any boobytraps hidden, any precautions that Batman has taken to ensure his secret stays safe? So Tim diligently inspects the three large paintings on the walls, then runs his hand along the tapestry, searching for a hidden switch. He finds nothing, but he\u2019s not discouraged. Teenage boys don\u2019t just disappear.\nSuddenly, a loud gong fills the air. It\u2019s the huge grandfather clock in one corner, striking midnight. Tim holds his breath, irrationally afraid that someone might hear all the noise and come in, but nobody does. Once the clock has struck twelve times, it stops, and Tim is ready to turn away, when something occurs to him.\nThe clock. It must be. There\u2019s no other explanation.\nHe first searches for a handle or switch and, finding nothing, he starts messing with the hands. Nothing comes from that, either, but he\u2019s sure that he\u2019s on to something. It\u2019s like entering a pincode. The problem with pincodes is, of course, that there are so many possibilities that it takes ages to try them all, and, again, Tim doesn\u2019t know if Batman has had a mechanism built that\u2019s triggered when you get it wrong a certain number of times. It\u2019s what Tim would do.\nSo, he gives up, and goes back to bed. He\u2019s done enough discovering for one night. Sometimes, it\u2019s smarter to cut your losses, and Tim knows when to back off.\nThe next morning, Dick tentatively mentions that the storm is still raging, and Bruce, eyes worried, says that he hasn\u2019t been able to reach Tim\u2019s parents yet.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they have reception right now,\u201d Tim says. \u201cBut it\u2019s fine, really. I can go back home now, I\u2019ll be okay.\u201d\nDick and Bruce share a look. \u201cPerhaps,\u201d Bruce says, \u201cit would be best if you would stay with us for another day. I don\u2019t feel safe letting you go to an empty house after what happened yesterday. Of course, if you\u2019re uncomfortable-\u201c\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Tim says immediately.\nBruce frowns. \u201cOkay?\u201d\nTim swallows a bite of cereal and says, \u201cIf you think it\u2019s best if I stay until tomorrow, I\u2019m fine with it. I trust your judgement.\u201d\nDick beams and ruffles his hair. \u201cThat\u2019s the spirit, Timmy.\u201d\nTim eats some more cereal and tries to ignore the look Bruce is levelling at him. He recognises that look from the mirror. It\u2019s one full of suspicion, and coming from Batman, it makes Tim so uncomfortable that all he wants is to shrink under that gaze. But he can\u2019t. If he does, then it\u2019s all for nothing.\n\u201cTim-\u201c Bruce starts, only to be interrupted by Jason: \u201cCan we go outside and make an igloo? Tim wants to, right, Tim?\u201d\n\u201cOf course he does,\u201d Dick answers before Tim gets the chance, \u201cbecause igloos are awesome. Everyone, outside in ten minutes! We\u2019re going to make the biggest igloo ever.\u201d\nTim feels a little bit bad as he follows Jason upstairs to change into warmer clothes. But it\u2019s not like he was lying to anyone. He doesn\u2019t want to go back to his house any sooner than he has to, and he\u2019s never built an igloo before, either. It sounds like fun, and he\u2019s already been invited, so he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s selfish to accept.\nThe fact that this means he gets to spend another night figuring out the mysteries of that grandfather clock is just a bonus.\nThat night, he sneaks out of the guest room as soon as he\u2019s bid everyone goodnight. He goes to the living room and hides behind a curtain, and then, he just waits.\nShortly after the clock has struck twelve, there\u2019s some movement, and Tim sees Bruce come in and -ha! \u2013 move the clockhands until the door swings open. Once it\u2019s closed again, Tim moves out from his hiding spot to check which time the clock has been set to. He does it just in time, too: he\u2019s only just seen 9:45 when the hands are turning again, being set from the inside until they\u2019re matching the actual time of shortly after ten.\n9:45, Tim thinks, memorising the number. Alright then.\nHe goes back behind the curtain, and watches both Dick and Jason come in and enter the entrance hidden behind the clock in quick succession. Jason, when it\u2019s his turn, actually looks around briefly, but it seems to be more paranoia than anything else, and soon enough, he, too, is gone.\nIt's getting late, but luckily, due to excessive stalking, Tim knows exactly when the Bats usually hit the streets in Gotham, and so he also knows that by the time it\u2019s midnight, Batman\u2019s lair must definitely be empty.\nTim\u2019s hands are trembling as he sets the clock\u2019s time to 9:45, but when the door swings open, he feels suddenly, strangely calm. He goes down a long flight of stairs, and just like that, he\u2019s in a gigantic cave. This is it, he thinks. Finally, this is it.\nHe absently notes that there seem to be actual, real-life bats here. He briefly glances at the dinosaur, frowning, but before he can investigate this further, his eyes are drawn to a huge computer. This must be where Batman enters case files and patrol reports and Justice League matters, and he probably has files on everyone he knows, and Tim is just dying to look at all of it.\nWell, why not? The cave is empty. There is literally no one stopping him.\nThe first thing Tim does once he has successfully logged onto the computer (which was, all things considered, not that much more difficult than illegally logging into the school administration computers) is to delete all the camera footage of the Cave from the past 10 minutes, then shut down the cameras completely for now.\nThen, he hacks into the latest case files (again, not that hard, and Batman should seriously reconsider his security measures), but just as he\u2019s really getting somewhere with case #C0482.4, an alarm goes off, and the computer screen flashes CODE 203 in neon-red letters.\nWithout thinking, Tim closes the file and types the code name into the computer search bar. What he finds is a list of every possible emergency. He scrolls down to the two hundreds. Code 200, Arkham outbreak (minor), Code 201, poisonous fog, Code 202, poisonous smog, Code 203, comm system down.\nOkay. Tim can work with that.\nFirst things first, bring the comms back up. Then, while he\u2019s trying to find out how the system broke down, he opens a live map of Gotham that has Batman, Robin and Nightwing\u2019s trackers blinking green. Nightwing and Batman seem to be in the middle of fighting some gang together, but Robin is much further away, and the tracker pinpoints him in abandoned building.\nFinally, the alarm stops, as the comm system is back. Immediately, Tim puts on the headset and logs on, just in time to hear Batman say, \u201c-knew Agent A was on vacation tonight. That\u2019s why I told you to stay behind. It\u2019s why I asked you here.\u201d\n\u201cWell, excuse me for realising that you could use all hands you needed in that fight,\u201d Nightwing shoots back testily. \u201cOh, hey, I think the comms are working again. Robin? Robin, can you hear me?\u201d\nRobin doesn\u2019t answer, probably because he\u2019s busy dismantling a bomb that is blinking red, red, red on the screen and also because, Tim suspects, his earpiece got damaged earlier as he was breaking down the door of that building.\n\u201cRobin,\u201d Batman demands in his characteristic growl. \u201cReport immediately.\u201d\nTim\u2019s hand hovers over the button that will activate the microphone. He\u2019s still hesitating, though. He wants to help, but he also knows that giving himself up like this will have the worst kind of consequences.\nHe leaves the button alone. Instead, he sends a message to both their phones, one that contains nothing except Robin\u2019s location. He has no idea if they even check their phones during patrol, but it\u2019s the best he can do right now.\nHe listens in for a few seconds more, just long enough to confirm that Nightwing saw the message and is now heading in Robin\u2019s direction, before breaking the link. He\u2019s just about to log off the computer, when he hesitates.\nIt's probably going to take Batman, Robin and Nightwing at least another thirty minutes to return to the cave, and that\u2019s if they\u2019re cutting patrol short. Either way, this leaves him enough time to do one last thing.\nHe has no idea if Batman is going to take his suggestions on how to improve his security, Tim thinks later once he\u2019s safely in bed, but at least this way, if Batman ever gets hacked by someone who isn\u2019t Tim, it won\u2019t be Tim\u2019s fault.\n*\nTim spends the entire breakfast quietly panicking that Bruce will be able to see through him, that he\u2019ll take one look at him and know immediately what he was up to last night. But not only is Bruce\u2019s attention mostly occupied by the newspaper, but also every time he does move to pour himself another cup of coffee or get another piece of toast, he makes sure to do so slowly, carefully projecting all of his movements. He does this without looking in Tim\u2019s direction, but Tim still feels like it\u2019s for his benefit.\nIt's only when Jason comes downstairs, already dressed in the school uniform but with his tie still hanging loosely around his neck, that Tim realises suddenly that it\u2019s Monday, which means he has school, which means he needs his books and his folders and his uniform.\nHe's just about to point this out, already mentally calculating the time it will take him to run to his house, when Mr Pennyworth \u2013 \u201ccall me Alfred, young sir\u201d \u2013 comes in, holding up Tim\u2019s uniform. \u201cI\u2019ve taken the liberty to wash and iron this for you,\u201d he says. Your backpack is by the door, Master Tim.\u201d\nTim abruptly remembers that the whole reason he is here is because Dick found him on his way to school. He\u2019d borrowed some clothes from Jason during the last couple of days, and in doing so, had completely forgotten that most of the stuff he needs for school is right here, in this house.\nHe gets dressed as quick as he can, and when he runs back down into the kitchen, it\u2019s just in time to hear the end of a whispered conversation:\n\u201c-investigate this matter.\u201d That\u2019s Bruce. He sounds worried. Worried and serious.\n\u201cWhoever it was, he certainly showed us up alright,\u201d someone answers \u2013 Dick, who must have joined the family in the kitchen while Tim was upstairs. \u201cThat\u2019s gotta be pretty embarrassing for you, B.\u201d\n\u201cJason, you\u2019ve been quiet all morning,\u201d Bruce says. \u201cIs something worrying you, son?\u201d\n\u201cActually-\u201c Jason starts, but it\u2019s at that moment that the floorboard beneath Tim\u2019s feet gives an ominous creak. The conversation immediately comes to a halt.\n\u201cTim,\u201d Dick calls out cheerfully, \u201cis that you? Hurry up, I\u2019m driving you guys to school today, give Alfie a bit of a break.\u201d\n\u201cThanks, Dick,\u201d Tim says, ducking his head shyly as he comes in, taking care to not look at Bruce for fear that his face would be giving something away.\nAll in all, he thinks later that day when he\u2019s sitting in class and doodling on his folder, this all went much better than expected. He got to see the Batcave, he learned how to build an igloo, he roasted marshmallows with Dick and Jason in one of the Wayne Manor\u2019s ancient chimneys, and Bruce hasn\u2019t even mentioned his parents again, so it looks like it\u2019s all good on that front. No one is calling CPS, no one got hypothermia, and no one is arresting him for breaking and entering. It\u2019s been a good weekend.\nIt's during lunch break that Tim realises he may have been too hasty in his judgement. He\u2019s in the canteen, eating the pastrami sandwich Alfred made him this morning, when someone sits down next to him. Tim looks up, thinking it\u2019s one of his friends, but it turns out to be Jason instead \u2013 who, he supposes, technically also counts as a friend these days. The thoughts fills him with excitement: Tim can call Robin his friend. Robin!\n\u201cAre you coming home with us later?\u201d Jason asks. \u201cYour parents are still gone, right?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but I\u2019m fine,\u201d Tim says. \u201cAnd also I\u2019ve got karate training.\u201d\n\u201cDo you?\u201d Jason asks, a strange glint in his eyes. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve looked up every sports centre in this city, and the only one that offers karate training on Mondays is at the other end of the town.\u201d\nTim, whose sports centre is only 20 minutes away from the school, by foot, tries to make his shrug look casual. \u201cI don\u2019t mind the drive.\u201d\n\u201cI bet you don\u2019t,\u201d Jason says, which strikes Tim as a really weird thing to say. \u201cWhat about after? You can come over, stay the night again. Bruce won\u2019t mind.\u201d\nTim thinks it\u2019s reasonably probable that this is accurate. Bruce won\u2019t mind a friend of his son\u2019s sleeping over, how could he? The manor is big enough that two dozen people could spend the night, maybe more. It\u2019s just that Bruce also can\u2019t be thrilled, either, about a kid invading his home like, four nights in a row. Not minding something is not the same as being enthusiastic about it, and Tim has always been good at knowing when his presence isn\u2019t wanted. His parents like him to make himself scarce a lot when they\u2019re home, so he\u2019s gotten in a lot of practice.\nAlso, there\u2019s the fact that Tim hasn\u2019t been out on the streets following Batman and Robin in nearly two weeks now, and he\u2019s itching to go out again.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t,\u201d he tells Jason. \u201cBut \u2013 maybe I can come visit some other day this week? If that\u2019s still okay? Only if you\u2019re not-\u201c\n\u201cSure,\u201d Jason interrupts. \u201cAny time. Don\u2019t be freaked out about this, but Bruce is probably going to invite you to dinner a lot these coming weeks, just while your parents are still on their trip. But that shouldn\u2019t be too long, right?\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d Tim lies. \u201cDefinitely not.\u201d\n\u201cGreat,\u201d Jason says, winks at him, and steals his juice box before he goes.\nThat night, Tim notices a change to the patrol route. Of course, Batman and Robin change their patrol route frequently, but they usually follow a certain pattern, one that Tim noticed ages ago. Tonight is different, though. It seems more random, less prepared, almost like they\u2019re forcing the change for some reason.\nDue to this, it\u2019s difficult to follow them, and more difficult still to stay out of sight. There are a couple of close calls, and Tim doesn\u2019t get to take a single picture. He spends the next day recalculating their route based on what he\u2019s seen tonight, and then the next night, he\u2019s on the roofs again and realises that they\u2019ve changed it all again. It\u2019s infuriating.\nIt goes on like this for over a week. Tim goes to school, he goes to karate training, he checks his phone for calls from his parents (zero), he has dinner with the Waynes two times, and at night, he watches Batman and Robin patrol without a pattern. Perhaps, he thinks, there\u2019s something in the air, a new poison fog outbreak or something. The last time that happened, everyone in Gotham had to wear gas masks for three days. It was super annoying, and it wasn\u2019t even a villain\u2019s fault, it was just the Gotham sewer system breaking down.\nBut whatever it is, it\u2019s pretty clear that only Batman and Robin are affected. Mind control? Except that when Tim has dinner with them, they seem perfectly fine.\nIt's after Robin and Batman patrol the same street two separate times in one night, each without realising that the other has already been here, and simultaneously missing a gang fight happening three blocks from there, that Tim decides enough is enough.\nLeaving a note to Batman and Robin in Gotham is too risky \u2013 he doesn\u2019t want anyone else to find it, and he has no way of making it so that only the recipients are able to open the letter. Luckily, that\u2019s not an issue. After all, Tim knows where they live.\nThe next time Jason invites him over, Tim excuses himself to go to the bathroom, then climbs out a window, sneaks back in downstairs, hastily enters the Batcave, leaves the letter with the USB drive on the desk, runs back upstairs, climbs up a drainpipe, flushes the toilet for show and exits the bathroom again just in time for dinner, all in under ten minutes. He\u2019s a little out of breath, but he doesn\u2019t think anyone notices.\u00a0\nEntering the Batcave again also made him realise that there are still no additional security measures anywhere. It\u2019s all Tim can do not to leave another note about that, too, because in the end, it\u2019s Batman\u2019s business, but really, shouldn\u2019t a man like that be more paranoid? It\u2019s disappointing, is what it is. If Tim was Batman, he\u2019d have the entire place boobytrapped.\nHe really wants to find out if Batman took his helpful feedback concerning patrol routes, but fate has other plans. The day after, he\u2019s only been in school for the first half of English Lit before the window to the classroom shatters and his teacher gets hit in the neck by a shard of glass and turns into a zombie.\nShit, shit, shit, Tim thinks as he\u2019s trapped in the crowd of his classmates, who, in their panic, are all trying to leave the classroom at the same time. This is not a problem he\u2019s going to solve by hacking some computers.\nNo alarm has gone off yet, which he takes to mean that nobody else in the school is in crisis mode so far, and the fire alarm is just outside the door but for that, he has to get out of here, and he can\u2019t, and the zombified teacher is already advancing.\nTim ducks under an arm, tries again to push through the crowd, when suddenly, his phone vibrates in his pocket. Mechanically, he pulls it out. It\u2019s an email from his parents\u2019 secretary, telling him his parents have postponed their flight again, but they\u2019ll be home in June for sure.\n\u201cNo phones in the classroom,\u201d his teacher screeches, and, hey, looks like the zombie thing made her voice stronger, too, because everyone winces simultaneously under the almost deafening shout. Immediately, people\u2019s attempts to get out of here become more frantic.\nTim, meanwhile, has been pushed into a corner, but it\u2019s okay, because he\u2019s actually more safe here than before. Here, he\u2019s able to take out his phone again, scroll down the list of contacts until he finds the right one, and press call.\n\u201cPick up, pick up, pick up,\u201d he mutters.\n\u201cTim?\u201d Jason asks, after what feels like an eternity. \u201cWhat\u2019s up? I had to sneak out the classroom, so this better not be a butt dial.\u201d\nTim wastes no time. \u201cGotham Academy is under attack, Ms Greenburg turned into a banshee-zombie, and we could really use a rescue right now.\u201d\nThere\u2019s silence at the other end of the line.\nTim, getting more panicked himself now, says, \u201cI can\u2019t get to the fire alarm, and the police won\u2019t get here fast enough. Look, can you just call Batman and tell him that he needs to come down here?\u201d\nMore silence.\n\u201cPlease, Jason,\u201d Tim says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get eaten by my English teacher.\u201d\nFinally, Jason says, \u201cFor the record, we will be talking about this later. Now, I\u2019ve texted B, but it\u2019s going to take him at least ten minutes. What\u2019s the situation?\u201d\nThe wave of relief that\u2019s running through him nearly makes him dizzy, but he has to concentrate. He holds his phone high up in the air, so that Jason can hear the screams of his classmates and the sound of his teacher trying to bite someone\u2019s leg off. \u201cDid you hear that?\u201d Tim asks, holding the phone close to his ear again.\n\u201cThat\u2019s pretty much been our last few minutes.\u201d\n\u201cCan you find somewhere to hide?\u201d\n\u201cNot really.\u201d\n\u201cTry,\u201d Jason orders. \u201cI\u2019m on my way.\u201d As if to underline his words, the alarm starts blaring. \u201cNow, just sit tight while-\u201c\nTim\u2019s teacher picks that moment to let out another scream, this one somehow even louder than the next. It makes most of the students drop to the floor, and Tim, too, is swaying on his feet already. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go,\u201d he tells Jason. \u201cI think she\u2019s trying to- oh no.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Jason demands. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d\nTim is no longer listening. The phone has slipped out of his unresisting grip, and he can only stare in horror as the teacher, having changed directions, is now on her way to where he\u2019s still perched in the corner. Her eyes are red.\nTim grabs a shard of glass from the floor and holds it out like a weapon. \u201cDon\u2019t come any closer,\u201d he says, and he\u2019s proud of the way his voice trembles only a little bit. \u201cIf you do, I\u2019m going to stab you.\u201d\n\u201cTim Drake,\u201d his teacher says. \u201cI\u2019ve never liked you. You never read a single one of the books even once.\u201d With that, she opens her mouth to scream again.\nTim doesn\u2019t think. He just throws the glass shard.\nIt lands in her open mouth. The teacher stops, chews, spits it out and says, her eyes glowing red again: \u201cI\u2019ve told you a million times, no gum in class.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s just depressing,\u201d Jason says as he jumps in through the window. Wait, not Jason. Robin. A part of Tim wonders if Jason has the Robin costume always with him, but he can also acknowledge that this is probably not the best time to be asking that question. \u201cB, did you hear how depressing that is?\u201d\n\u201cI heard,\u201d Batman confirms. He, too, climbs through the window.\nThe teacher gives another one of her banshee screams. This one is enough to knock Tim out for good this time, but it doesn\u2019t matter, he thinks as he slips into unconsciousness. He knows Batman and Robin will take care of it.\n*\nTim worries about being released from the hospital \u2013 his parents are neither in the country, nor inclined to answer phone calls, and his emergency contact is his grandfather, who died three years ago \u2013, but it turns out that wasn\u2019t necessary. As soon as the doctor declares him good to go, Dick and Jason enter his room. Dick is smiling. Jason isn\u2019t. Where Bruce is, Tim has no idea. Possibly preparing a nice cosy cell in the Batcave for him.\n\u201cTimmy,\u201d Dick exclaims, \u201clet\u2019s get you out of here. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve talked my way into letting you be released into my custody-\u201c\n\u201cFlirted your way into, you mean,\u201d Jason interrupts.\nDick\u2019s smile doesn\u2019t waver. \u201c-and so I say, let\u2019s get pancakes. My treat.\u201d\nWondering whether pancakes is code for something, and thoroughly unnerved by the way Jason is staring at him, Tim mutters, \u201cI should probably get back to class. I\u2019ve got a test today.\u201d\n\u201cWhat,\u201d Dick says, sounding aghast. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to school today. You almost got killed!\u201d\n\u201cBut the test-\u201c\n\u201cAnyway, I spoke to your headmaster earlier, and the rest of today\u2019s classes are cancelled,\u201d Dick adds. \u201cSo there\u2019s no reason why you can\u2019t have pancakes with us.\u201d\nBefore Tim can voice any further protests, Dick is already leading him down the hallways, his arm firmly around Tim\u2019s shoulders, both a steadying weight and a way to make sure he can\u2019t escape. Tim gulps.\nHe waits until they\u2019re in Dick\u2019s car, safely out of earshot of any hospital workers, to say, \u201cAbout what I said earlier-\u201c\n\u201cDick,\u201d Jason says, talking right over Tim, \u201cI think I forgot my phone in the waiting room. Can you go check?\u201d\nDick frowns. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, did you forget that you have two working legs?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but I don\u2019t want to leave Tim on his own. Tim wants me here, right?\u201d\n\u201cUm,\u201d Tim says, shrinking under Jason\u2019s glower, \u201cyeah. Yes. I do.\u201d\n\u201cSee,\u201d Jason says smugly, reaching over Dick to open the driver\u2019s door. \u201cOut you go.\u201d\nDick throws them both a suspicious glance, but in end, he gives in. \u201cDon\u2019t mess with my seat,\u201d he orders before leaving.\nAs soon as he\u2019s gone, Jason slides into the driver\u2019s seat to adjust the settings, moving it until it\u2019s as far away from the wheel as possible. \u201cSo,\u201d he says while he\u2019s shuffling through Dick\u2019s collection of CDs, \u201cjust so you know, I didn\u2019t tell Bruce or Dick anything. Yet. I wanted to hear what you\u2019ve got to say first. And if I don\u2019t like what I hear, then I\u2019m telling Bruce immediately.\u201d\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t tell him,\u201d Tim blurts out. \u201cI promise your secret is safe with me. I haven\u2019t told anyone so far, so-\u201c\n\u201cWait,\u201d Jason says, narrowing his eyes, \u201chow long have you known?\u201d\n\u201cUm,\u201d Tim says, alarmed. \u201cNot long? Why, how long do you think I\u2019ve known? Because it\u2019s probably that.\u201d\n\u201cWhat I know is that you\u2019ve been stalking us at night for several months. What I thought is that you stumbled upon the Cave by accident when you were staying over that first night, and that it made you realise who we are. But now I\u2019m thinking that\u2019s not quite right, is it?\u201d\nTim deflates. \u201cNo,\u201d he admits quietly. \u201cI\u2019ve known a bit longer.\u201d\n\u201cHow long?\u201d\nTim hesitates. \u201cWell,\u201d he says, \u201cthe first time I technically met Robin \u2013 well, Robin in costume \u2013 was three years ago, but I\u2019ve only really known who you are for two years, and I\u2019ve only been following you for one and a half. You\u2019re doing a great job, by the way, but you go off on your own too much, and if you partnered up with Nightwing more, you could increase your efficiency by twenty per cent. It\u2019s all in my file.\u201d\nJason is staring at him with wide eyes. Right now, he looks less like badass Robin and more like a kid who\u2019s just had a fundamental revelation about the world dropped in his lap. \u201cWow,\u201d he breathes, \u201cyou\u2019re, like, a proper stalker. Crazy. Wait a minute, I wasn\u2019t Robin three years ago!\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Tim says, shrugging faux-casually even though his heart is hammering a mile a minute, \u201cI met Dick first. But he lied to me, and superheroes are not supposed to lie, even if you guys are technically vigilantes, so I think you\u2019re way better than him. But you really do go off on your own too much.\u201d\n\u201cI cannot believe you met Dick,\u201d Jason says, clearly not listening. \u201cAnd that asshole didn\u2019t even tell me about it.\u201d\nTim shrugs again. \u201cMaybe,\u201d he says delicately, \u201che lied to you. He does that.\u201d\n\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d Jason says, but Dick picks that moment to return to the car. Jason only has time to make a cut-throat motion before his big brother flops back into the driver\u2019s seat, glaring at him.\n\u201cThere was no phone!\u201d\n\u201cOops,\u201d Jason says, pulling the offending item out of his pocket, \u201cyeah, I guess it was here the whole time, sorry about that.\u201d\nThe brothers start arguing, but Tim leans his head against the window and tunes them out. It\u2019ll be okay, he thinks. Jason has not told Dick, and he\u2019s not going to tell Bruce, probably. It can be like their secret. It\u2019s only fair, after all, if Jason has a secret about Tim, after Tim had one about him for so long.\nIt\u2019ll be a secret, and Bruce will never, ever find out and, therefore, Tim will never, ever have to face the consequences of his actions. He supposes that under the circumstances, it\u2019s the best he could hope for.\n*\nFebruary gives way to March gives way to April, and throughout all those weeks, Tim waits for Jason to tell on him, and Jason never does. They don\u2019t talk about Jason\u2019s nightly activities, exactly, but every once in a while, Jason will say something like, \u201cGot in pretty late last night\u201d or \u201cmy ribs still hurt from that hit I took\u201d. Tim is never sure what he\u2019s supposed to reply to these sorts of statements, and at first he just keeps quiet, but eventually, he\u2019s unable to keep his mouth shut any longer, and he says, \u201cYour ribs wouldn\u2019t hurt so much if you watched your left side more. You never do.\u201d\n\u201cWere you watching us again?\u201d Jason exclaims. \u201cI told you not to.\u201d\nThey\u2019re in Jason\u2019s bedroom, and until just now, they were playing scrabble, which Jason insisted on and which he\u2019s been winning at ever since they started, but now, Jason shoves the board away to lightly punch Tim\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI didn\u2019t see you,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty good at hiding. Worryingly good, actually.\u201d\nTim knows he\u2019s blushing, but he can\u2019t help it. He tries to hide his face by looking out the window, where it turns out that two storeys down below, Bruce and Dick are in the \u201cgarden\u201d (more like a park), doing their best to\u2026fell a tree? Or something?\nJason, following his gaze, says, \u201cThey\u2019re building a treehouse. Bruce read somewhere that it\u2019s good for kids to have one. He\u2019s subscribed to, like, three different parent magazines. Last week, he got me a nightlight. We go fight crime five times a week, and he thinks I need a nightlight shaped like a racoon.\u201d\nTim remembers, abruptly, that he used to be scared of the dark. He\u2019d liked to keep his door open at night and, when his parents objected, he kept the lamp on his bedside table switched on. He\u2019d done it this way for a few weeks, until his parents realised what he was doing and-\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need a nightlight, do you, Tim?\u201d his dad had asked. \u201cYou\u2019re a big boy.\u201d\n\u201cBut Mom said that Batman only comes when it\u2019s dark,\u201d Tim protested. \u201cI don\u2019t want him to come.\u201d\nHis mom had pursed her lips. \u201cDon\u2019t talk back to your parents. If you do, Batman is not going to care what time it is. He makes exceptions for little boys who\u2019re especially naughty.\u201d\nThat had been that. Tim hadn\u2019t turned on the light again, and after some time, he\u2019d been able to fall asleep anyway.\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d Jason says, effectively bringing Tim\u2019s conscious back to the here and now of Jason\u2019s surprisingly tidy bedroom, \u201cI know you have karate lessons, but that\u2019s not going to be enough for one scrawny ten-year-old who\u2019s getting attacked by a grown man. You should have a few more tricks up your sleeve.\u201d\n\u201cLike what?\u201d Tim asks, his interest piqued. \u201cCan you show me?\u201d\nIt's a bold question, so bold that a few months ago, he wouldn\u2019t have dared ask. But that was Before \u2013 before Jason befriended him, before the daily rides to school and the family dinners everyone keeps inviting Tim to for some reason, before Tim revealed that he knows what Jason and Bruce do after dark. Now, he feels certain that Jason is going to say-\n\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d Jason grins at him. \u201cBut we can\u2019t do it here, not if you don\u2019t want B to find out. We\u2019ll have to meet at your place.\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d Tim says, even though he\u2019s already freaking out at the thought of it. He\u2019ll have to clean his room, and he\u2019ll have to distract Jason enough so that he won\u2019t notice that clearly, there has been no one but Tim here since February, and also, what if Jason is going to think he\u2019s useless at fighting?But he also really, really wants to get taught by Robin. So he ignores all those anxieties, and later, it turns out he needn\u2019t have worried anyway, because Jason doesn\u2019t want to go inside the house, anyway. They go to the Drakes\u2019 garden (an actual garden, albeit a big one), and Jason shows Tim everything: how to punch someone in the throat, how to headbutt them, how to knee them in the groin and, finally, how to run away.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want you to have to do any of this,\u201d Jason tells him once they\u2019re done and the sun is already setting, wiping the sweat from his brow, \u201cbut if you\u2019re really going to follow us, you should be prepared. By the way, I\u2019ve been meaning to ask \u2013 how did you meet Dickhead, anyway? I asked him, but he said something about his parents\u2019 circus, and that can\u2019t be right.\u201d\n\u201cWe did meet there,\u201d Tim says, summarising the incident as quicky as possible. \u201cBut then a couple of years later, I, um. I was trying to get Batman\u2019s attention, but then Robin came instead. It\u2019s dumb. I know I shouldn\u2019t have gotten my hopes up.\u201d\n\u201cWhat hopes?\u201d\nTim blushes again, he can\u2019t help it. What he did is already embarrassing enough, but talking about it, actually admitting to how pathetic he is, makes it so much worse. \u201cAll the stories said that Batman comes for kids who\u2019re bad, so I thought if I\u2019m really, really bad, then Batman will come and take me away. I told you, it\u2019s really dumb.\u201d\nJason tilts his head. \u201cStories?\u201d he repeats questioningly.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Tim shrugs. \u201cLike, you know when you did something bad as a kid, your parents would tell you, don\u2019t do that or else Batman will come for you in your sleep?\u201d\n\u201cWhat,\u201d Jason says flatly.\n\u201cLike,\u201d Tim says, warming up to the subject now, \u201cif you\u2019re getting a B on an exam or chewing too loudly, then your parents are gonna ask if you think Batman would like that sort of thing, and you know that he won\u2019t, and so you stop. Didn\u2019t your mom ever do this with you?\u201d\n\u201cShe really, really didn\u2019t.\u201d Jason is staring at him like he\u2019s grown a second head. \u201cAre Bristol parents really using Batman as the boogieman? Unbelievable. B is gonna hate it.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell him,\u201d Tim says quickly, only realising he\u2019s made a mistake when Jason narrows his eyes.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not still scared of Batman, are you?\u201d\nTim shakes his head immediately. \u201cNope. I just don\u2019t think you should bother him about this. He\u2019s really busy.\u201d\n\u201cHm,\u201d Jason says. He sounds suspicious.\n\u201cLet\u2019s start training again,\u201d Tim suggests. Anything to get Jason off his back.\nLuckily, it turns out Jason can\u2019t resist an excuse to show off his skills, and by the time they finally stop, they\u2019re both so exhausted that their earlier conversation is all but forgotten.\n*\nThe school year is nearing its end, the holidays are just around the corner, and it\u2019s warm enough that Tim doesn\u2019t even need his coat anymore when he goes out at night. A heatwave has Gotham firmly in its stronghold, and he\u2019s already been invited to go canoeing with the Waynes this weekend. He\u2019s never been canoeing before, but he\u2019s looking forward to it.\nHis parents called him two days ago. Something came up, but they\u2019ll be home in July for sure, in time for his birthday. Tim hasn\u2019t seen them in almost four months.\nHe tries not to think about this as he climbs a rooftop. It\u2019s early still, so he spreads his blanket over a patch of roof that doesn\u2019t have an oil puddle on it (a remnant from the oil rain yesterday, thanks, Gotham), and then he spends some time looking through the pictures he took yesterday, pausing briefly at each of the better shots.\nBatman and Robin are back to their usual patrol route. When Tim brought it up, Jason told him that it\u2019s Batman\u2019s paranoia that had encouraged him to change it.\n\u201cHe\u2019s not very paranoid when it comes to his home security,\u201d Tim had said.\n\u201cHe\u2019s extremely paranoid,\u201d Jason had corrected \u201cwhich is why it drove him crazy to know that someone had been in the cave two times without him knowing.\u201d\nTim thanks his lucky stars that he only befriended Jason when he was ten. Three years ago, he would have certainly used his knowledge of where the Batcave is to try and blackmail Batman into stealing him away from his parents, and he\u2019s certain that Batman would not have taken too kindly to that. Besides, knowing both Jason and Dick has made Tim realise that Batman definitely doesn\u2019t need another son. He already has two great ones. What does he want with Tim?\nHe's been up here maybe half an hour when he hears a weird noise behind him. As he turns around, he sees that it\u2019s Robin who\u2019s landed behind him.\nRobin grins at him. \u201cThought I\u2019d see you here.\u201d\n\u201cLemonade?\u201d Tim asks, holding up a thermos. \u201cI made it myself earlier.\u201d\n\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d Robin says. \u201cJust came here for a quick smoke.\u201d\nTim watches as Robin lights a cigarette. He can\u2019t help but feel warm inside. They\u2019ve come so far since that night Tim first caught Robin smoking by accident. Jason trusts him with these things now.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Robin says once he\u2019s exhaled the first breath of smoke, \u201cI can\u2019t stay long, but I wanted to say hello to my favourite stalker. Don\u2019t stay out too long, okay? You\u2019ve got that test tomorrow.\u201d\nTim does have a test, but he\u2019s mostly stuck on the fact that Jason remembers what Tim mentioned in passing. He remembers, and he worries.\n\u201cI\u2019ll go home soon,\u201d he promises. \u201cJust another hour, maybe.\u201d\n\u201cOne hour. I\u2019ll hold you to that,\u201d Robin says and flicks his cigarette to the ground.\nDirectly into the puddle of oil.\nWhich goes up in flames.\nTim jumps back, and Robin does, too. Both of them are helpless to do anything but watch as the fire spreads from puddle to puddle, quickly consuming over half the roof.\nThey need to get out of here. Tim\u2019s camera is around his neck. The rest of his backpack is too far away, so he won\u2019t have a choice but to sacrifice it. \u201cCome on,\u201d he yells at Robin, taking him by the wrist to drag him in the direction of the fire escape. \u201cWe have to go!\u201d\nRobin allows himself to be dragged along, but when they reach the stairs, he shakes his head, pulling out his grapple gun instead and shooting it at the next building before grabbing Tim. Together, they land on the street before the building that is currently in the process of burning down.\n\u201cShit,\u201d Jason says, \u201cshit, shit, fucking shit-\u201c\n\u201cCalm down,\u201d Tim tells him, grabbing him by the shoulders, \u201cyou need to calm down, okay? You can\u2019t freak out.\u201d\n\u201cA building is burning down because of me,\u201d Robin yells at him. \u201cB is going to bench me for this. Worse, he\u2019s going to take Robin away entirely, and it\u2019s going to be justified, because I singlehandedly burnt a building to the ground.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe we can extinguish the fire,\u201d Tim says, but he already knows that there\u2019s no point. By now, someone might have called the fire department, but the flames have already spread too far, courtesy of the stupid oil rain. They\u2019ll be lucky if it\u2019s only one building and not the whole street.\nRobin\u2019s breath is going fast and panicked. \u201cHe\u2019s going to kill me,\u201d he mutters. \u201cHe\u2019s going to kill me and I won\u2019t even protest because I\u2019m the worst moron alive.\u201d\nTim abruptly remembers playing with matchsticks once as a toddler, and he remembers being scolded for it by his mom, who told him -\n\u201cIf you keep at that, you\u2019re going to light the house on fire, and I think you can imagine what Batman\u2019s going to do.\u201d\nAt four years old, he had been able to imagine.\nAt seven, he thought that this would be the perfect opportunity.\nAt ten, seeing Robin panic at the thought of Batman finding out that he did, in fact, lit a house on fire, Tim realises what he has to do.\n\u201cLeave,\u201d he blurts out. \u201cBatman is going to be here soon. You can just say you were patrolling somewhere else, he won\u2019t find out.\u201d\n\u201cWhat,\u201d Robin says, voice edging on hysterical, \u201cthere are cameras, of course he\u2019ll find out-\u201c\n\u201cHe\u2019ll only check the footage if there\u2019s no perpetrator. But there will be, because I\u2019m going to tell him that it\u2019s me who did it.\u201d\nRobin is staring at him now, eyes wide. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but he doesn\u2019t know that. This way, you won\u2019t get benched. It\u2019s fine, okay? Go.\u201d\nThree agonising seconds pass. Then, finally, Robin hugs him, says, \u201cThank you,\u201d and is gone.\nTim stands frozen to the spot while behind him, the fire is raging on. Jason hugged him. Robin hugged him. Technically, he supposes it\u2019s his second Robin hug. He\u2019s going to start a collection.\nIn the end, it doesn\u2019t matter whether the fire department was alerted or not, because Batman gets there first. One minute, Tim is alone, and the next, he\u2019s not.\nBatman steps out of the shadows, his mouth set in a grim line as he looks down at Tim.\nAnd Tim-\nTim is suddenly seven years old again, he\u2019s set a fire to a trash can, and all he wants is for Batman to take him away from his parents and adopt him. But now that Batman has actually come, now that he got what he asked for, he\u2019s realising that there is no way Batman is ever going to adopt him. Instead, he\u2019s going to realise how bad Tim is, and he\u2019s going to punish him, and when he\u2019s done, he\u2019s going to send him back home, and that might be worse than any physical pain he could possibly inflict.\nHis pulse speeds up, but Tim forcibly reminds himself that this isn\u2019t about him. It\u2019s about helping Robin, helping Jason.\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Batman demands.\nTim takes a deep breath and says, \u201cIt was me. I set the building on fire. It\u2019s my fault.\u201d\nBatman looks from him, to the burning building, and back to him. He takes a step forward. Instinctively, Tim takes a step back, heart thundering. He forces himself to stay still the next time Batman moves, but he still can\u2019t stop himself from flinching when Batman raises a hand.\nBatman stops, hand hovering a few inches above Tim\u2019s shoulder. When he speaks next, he sounds like he\u2019s actively trying to sound less growly. \u201cThis is no place for a child. We\u2019ll go somewhere where we can talk.\u201d\nIt takes an enormous amount of effort to nod, but Tim manages. \u201cOkay,\u201d he says. \u201cLet\u2019s talk.\u201d\nBatman hesitates. \u201cYes,\u201d he agrees finally. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk.\u201d\nTim nods again, trying to be encouraging now. Maybe it\u2019s been a while since Batman punished a kid instead of adopting it. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry,\u201d he tells him. \u201cI won\u2019t resist. I\u2019m not promising that I won\u2019t scream when you hurt me, because making promises like that just sets people up for disappointment, but I\u2019ll do my best. So we can go have that talk now.\u201d He winks, even though he\u2019s secretly filled with dread.\nBatman stares at him. \u201cI\u2019m taking you to the Batmobile, and we\u2019ll talk there.\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d Tim agrees, as Batman wraps an arm around his shoulders and starts guiding him away, \u201cthat\u2019s totally cool. I love conversations. Conversations are the best.\u201d He\u2019s babbling, but he thinks he\u2019s allowed, because if he doesn\u2019t, then his throat is going to close up in terror.\nBatman steers him towards the Batmobile, opens the door for him and, once they\u2019re both inside, locks the doors. Tim feels the blood drain from his face. This is happening. This is-\n\u201cYo! Open up!\u201d It's Robin, knocking on the window on Batman\u2019s side. \u201cB, seriously, let me in!\u201d\nBatman slides down the window. \u201cTake care of that fire,\u201d he orders, \u201cand then finish patrol. I\u2019ll join you as soon as possible.\u201d\n\u201cB, you don\u2019t get it,\u201d Robin says, \u201cI\u2019m the one who-\u201c\n\u201cI\u2019ll speak with you later,\u201d Batman says, and rolls up the window again. Immediately, Robin starts knocking on it again. Batman sighs, then presses a button, so that the glass switches from see-through to black.\n\u201cThat\u2019s so cool,\u201d Tim breathes, before he remembers that Batman is probably doing this so that there aren\u2019t any witnesses. He gulps. \u201cIn case you\u2019re going to eat me,\u201d he says, \u201ccan I close my eyes?\u201d\nBatman blinks. \u201cI\u2019m not going to eat you. Why would you think I\u2019d eat you?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I committed arson,\u201d Tim explains helpfully, \u201cand if you think about it, I\u2019m actually a repeat offender, so I think probably you would have let me get off mildly the first time but this time there\u2019s no way you can just let me go. Can I just ask one question though?\u201d\nBatman looks dazed. He doesn\u2019t reply, which Tim takes for permission.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2019ve been wondering,\u201d he says, \u201cwhat made you adopt Dick and Jason \u2013 sorry, Nightwing and Robin?\u201d\n\u201cWhat,\u201d Batman says.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Tim says, \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about this a lot, and I know they\u2019re both orphans and poor, but there\u2019s lots of poor orphans in Gotham, so it must have been something else. Is it because they kind of look like you? Or was there some sort of test? Could someone who\u2019s got wealthy parents also take that test? Like, theoretically speaking. Like, if you were taking applications, which I know you aren\u2019t! But if you were.\u201d\nBatman looks like someone\u2019s hit him over the head with a blunt object. It\u2019s not a very impressive look. \u201cBe honest with me,\u201d he growls, and Tim immediately sits up straighter at his tone. \u201cDo you know our true identities?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but it\u2019s okay. Like I said to Jason, I\u2019m not going to tell on you guys. But I guess it doesn\u2019t matter anyway after today, because it\u2019s not like I\u2019ll be able to talk to anyone from a cell. Wait, do you let your prisoners make phone calls? I think you should. It\u2019s what they do in prison. Do you even get reception in the Batcave?\u201d\n\u201cStop,\u201d Batman says. \u201cStop talking. I need to- I should- I need to think about this. You have to be quiet now so I can think about it.\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d Tim says. \u201cCan I press the button that tinted the windows? Or does it only work for your fingerprint? If not, I think you should change it. All your technology should be wired so that only you can use it. I\u2019ve been meaning to write you a letter about that.\u201d\n\u201cTim,\u201d Batman says, massaging his temples, \u201cplease. Please be quiet now.\u201d\nThis time, Tim presses his lips together and vows to say nothing more. He\u2019s already in enough trouble as it is, he doesn\u2019t need to antagonise Batman. It\u2019s just that this is the first time he\u2019s in the Batmobile, and Batman is the only one who can answer his questions, and he has so many of them. Maybe once Batman has locked him up, Tim can ask him whenever he comes to give him food. He will give Tim food, right? He wouldn\u2019t just let him starve?\nTim opens his mouth to ask, but Batman looks deep in thought, so he shuts it again. He\u2019ll ask him later. Actually, he thinks suddenly, he should probably text his parents, tell them he might not be home for a while. Then again, it\u2019s not like they\u2019ll be home any time soon, either. Maybe they won\u2019t even notice.\nThat thought puts a damper on his excitement over being in the Batmobile, and he spends the next few minutes moodily staring at the darkened window, wondering what\u2019s going to happen to him. He\u2019s no longer panicked, or at least, he\u2019s not really panicked. Maybe just a little. But mostly, he\u2019s made his peace with the situation. He supposes this was always coming.\nEventually, after what feels like an eternity, Batman turns to him. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask you a few questions,\u201d he says, \u201cand I want you to-\u201c\nOne of the back windows shatters.\nBefore anyone can react, Nightwing wipes away the remaining glass shards and sticks his head inside. \u201cHey, guys,\u201d he says cheerily. \u201cWhat\u2019re you up to?\u201d\n\u201cNightwing,\u201d Batman says, sounding aggrieved, \u201ccould you-\u201c\n\u201cTim, are you okay?\u201d Robin asks, shoving Nightwing aside so he can get a better look at them. \u201cB, he looks scared to death! What\u2019d you do to him?\u201d\n\u201cSeriously, it\u2019s fine, guys,\u201d Tim says. \u201cBatman is just thinking about my punishment. My mom was never really clear on that, but I guess it has to be different depending on the crime, right? Like, for forgetting to turn off the light, you get beaten up, but then for talking back to your parents you get shoved in a cell and you\u2019re never seeing the sun again, and then, I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going to happen for arson. Do you guys know?\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Nightwing says loudly, \u201clet\u2019s get you out of here. Batman, unlock the door, please.\u201d\nBatman does not seem inclined to do so. \u201cWhere are you taking him?\u201d\n\u201cHome. Bludhaven. Robin told me everything, and clearly you\u2019re not equipped to handle this sort of thing, so I\u2019ve decided to take Timmy with me. Tim, do you like protein shakes? It\u2019s all I\u2019ve got in the fridge right now, but if you don\u2019t like that, we can buy some cereal, too. A growing boy needs a healthy snack like that.\u201d\n\u201cCereal isn\u2019t healthy, moron,\u201d Jason says, \u201cand if you\u2019re taking Tim to Bludhaven, I want to come too. B, open the door so we can go to Dickwing\u2019s apartment!\u201d\n\u201cNobody is taking anyone to Bludhaven,\u201d Batman roars, \u201cbecause we\u2019re all going to the manor, right now. Robin, Nightwing, you\u2019re taking Nightwing\u2019s bike. Tim and I will be taking the Batmobile. Someone inform Agent A we\u2019re on our way. If I don\u2019t see you in the Cave in fifteen minutes, I\u2019m going to look for you, and you won\u2019t like it when I do.\u201d\nOn the way to the manor, Batman runs over three red lights, but Tim doesn\u2019t point it out. His breath is going fast again. He\u2019s never heard Batman shout like that before, but it fits in with all the stories. And now Batman is angry at Nightwing and Robin, too, so Tim\u2019s sacrifice was for nothing. This is really the worst day.\nThey arrive in the Batcave at the same time as Nightwing and Robin, who, too, must have broken the speed limits to get here this quickly. They both take off their domino masks as soon as they\u2019re there, and Batman, too, takes off his cowl. It doesn\u2019t make him any less intimidating, and Tim suddenly feels very small, standing next to him.\n\u201cNow,\u201d Bruce says, \u201cI believe we need to talk. All of us. Jason, you go first. Everything, please.\u201d\nJason has moved so that he\u2019s now close enough to stand slightly in front of Tim, and Tim realises belatedly that he\u2019s shielding him. While he listens to Jason explain everything \u2013 how they met, how Jason realised Tim knew their identities, and anything that came after \u2013, he keeps sneaking glances at Bruce, trying to gouge whether he looks upset. Bruce, though, is wearing a pokerface that Tim cannot read at all.\nJason, obviously used to giving clear, succinct reports, leaves nothing out. He only stumbles a bit when he explains what happened tonight. Tim tries to stop him by tugging on his sleeve, but Jason ignores him as he tells Bruce all about how, exactly, that building came to burn down. \u201cSo it\u2019s on me,\u201d Jason finishes, \u201cand Tim tried to take the fall for me.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you let him,\u201d Bruce says, tone unreadable.\nJason crosses his arms. \u201cYes, but I changed my mind immediately once I remembered what Tim had said about his parents. So I called Dickie instead, and he came immediately, and you locked the doors so getting a crowbar and shattering the windows was our only option, really, and you can\u2019t shout at me for that.\u201d\n\u201cCan confirm,\u201d Dick says, raising his hand like he\u2019s in school.\nBruce ignores him. It\u2019s obvious he\u2019s still in investigation mode, which Tim would find really cool if this was any other day, any other situation. \u201cYou\u2019ve mentioned Tim\u2019s parents. What about them? What did he say?\u201d\n\u201cUm,\u201d Tim says, tugging at Jason\u2019s sleeve again, \u201cI don\u2019t think we need to-\u201c\n\u201cEvery time he did something wrong, they told him Batman would come and eat him,\u201d Jason says, immediately and accusingly. \u201cHe\u2019s spent his entire childhood being scared of you, B. Is that messed up or what?\u201d\n\u201cThis is why I\u2019ve suggested a costume change,\u201d Dick says, raising his hand again. \u201cI told you many times that you\u2019ll scare the kids like this.\u201d\n\u201cTim, is this true?\u201d Bruce asks. He looks stricken. \u201cYou\u2019re scared of me?\u201d\nTim glances from Bruce, to Dick, to Jason, and back to Bruce again. He\u2019s caught between not wanting to lie, and knowing that Batman won\u2019t like hearing the truth. Then again, his parents told him many times that lying alerts Batman to your whereabouts instantly, so.\n\u201cI\u2019m not not scared,\u201d he says eventually. \u201cI mean, I know all the good you do for this city! I\u2019m a big fan. It\u2019s just that you\u2019re, you know, really big, and every time you talk to me I remember all the things my parents said you\u2019d do, and then I remember all the times I\u2019ve been bad, and then it just sort of spirals from there. And I know rationally that you probably don\u2019t eat children, but I don\u2019t know all the other stuff! Setting a trashcan on fire is minor, but knowing your identities, that\u2019s like, huge, and I can\u2019t tell how you\u2019re going to react, so that makes me nervous.\u201d\nStunned silence answers him. At long last, though, it\u2019s Dick who speaks up.\n\u201cI remember us meeting now,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten, but Jason mentioned it, and then you mentioned that trashcan, and it came back to me. This was something like three years ago, right? You were so tiny, I thought you were much younger than you actually were. One day on patrol,\u201d he says, speaking directly to Batman now, \u201cthere was this kid who\u2019d started a fire, and he wanted to speak to you. He insisted on it.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you lied to me,\u201d Tim accuses, the old hurt from that night still not fully gone, not even after all these years. \u201cYou told me you were taking me home instead.\u201d\nDick smiles ruefully. \u201cAt the time, I thought I was doing you a favour. I\u2019m sorry, Tim. But- what I still don\u2019t understand is this: if you were truly that scared of Batman, why did you want to meet him so badly?\u201d\nThey\u2019re all looking at him, and it\u2019s hard not to shrink away under all that attention. And yet, Tim\u2019s voice is clear when he admits, \u201cMy parents told me that if I was bad, Batman would take me away. I thought that it\u2019d be worth the risk. I mean, maybe he\u2019d hurt me, but it could only be better than living in an empty house, right? So I decided to take my chances.\u201d\nDick moves forward, so suddenly and quickly that in the first panicked second, Tim thinks he\u2019s going to hit him. Instead, he\u2019s enveloped in a tight hug instead.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Dick says again, whispers it into his hair. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry that I didn\u2019t let you speak to Batman that night. Your parents were right in one instance. He would\u2019ve taken you away immediately. He\u2019d have adopted you that very night.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d Tim asks, his words muffled by being spoken into Dick\u2019s broad chest. \u201cEven though I\u2019m not an orphan or poor?\u201d\n\u201cEven then,\u201d Dick promises. \u201cRight, Bruce?\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d Bruce says, his tone gruff. \u201cI\u2019m aware we haven\u2019t spent much time together, but I do know that if I had met you back then, I would have been glad to have another son.\u201d\nTim nods. This makes sense, he thinks. This was before Bruce had Jason, so maybe he always wanted two sons all along, and then when he adopted Jason, he\u2019d reached his quota.\n\u201cAnd,\u201d Bruce continues, clearing his throat, \u201cI hope I\u2019m not out of line when I say that I would still be happy to get another son.\u201d\nTim almost pushes Dick away in an effort to turn around to stare at Bruce. \u201cReally?\u201d he asks breathlessly. \u201cDo you mean that? What about the test?\u201d\n\u201cTest?\u201d Jason echoes.\nBruce shakes his head. \u201cThere is no test. You don\u2019t have to decide now, anyway. But when you do, it\u2019s just a yes-or-no question, nothing more. So whenever you\u2019re ready-\u201c\n\u201cYes,\u201d Tim interrupts. \u201cYes, I would like to be adopted, please, Mr Batman, sir. I know you can\u2019t really adopt me, because I still have parents, but maybe you could be, like, my secret dad, and I could come over once a week and we could play secret catch and have secret meals, and my real parents would never know.\u201d\nHe sees Bruce and Dick share a look, but he\u2019s too happy to figure out what that means. He thinks this is genuinely the happiest he\u2019s ever been in his life, and he never wants this moment to end. When he set fire to that trashcan all those years ago, he hadn\u2019t dared imagine a best-case scenario for himself, but he thinks that if he had, this would have been it. Exactly this, nothing more, nothing less. It\u2019s an exhilarating feeling.\n*\n\nThree years later\n\nOf all the ways to break his arm, this has got to be one of the more stupid ones. He didn\u2019t break it because of the giant-spider invasion (not to be confused with the giant spider-invasion, which happened last month) that happened this morning and caused Gotham Academy to shut down for the day, again. No, he broke it when on his way out the school gates. Tim had been busy texting, and with his eyes glued to the phone, he hadn\u2019t watched where he\u2019d been going. A painful tumble down the stairs later, he\u2019s learned his lesson, but his arm still hurts like hell.\nThe ride in the ambulance is supremely boring, especially because his phone cracked during that fall, so now he can\u2019t even distract himself from the pain. And of course this all happened when tomorrow, his class is going on a rowing trip, too. Maybe he\u2019ll be able to stay home, at least. He thinks if he has to go sit in another class, he\u2019d literally rather drink a glass straight from Gotham River (a bunch of scientists tested it recently, and found that the water bears alarming similarities to oil, but only if oil were also poisonous).\nTim\u2019s lying in the hospital bed, waiting for his X-Rays to come back, when a nurse comes in, giving him a sympathetic look. \u201cWe have to call someone,\u201d she says, \u201cbut-\u201c\nIn that moment, Tim can feel his stomach sinking. He\u2019s been at this before.\nWe\u2019ve tried calling, but nobody picked up. We\u2019ve tried calling, but could only reach your parents\u2019 secretary.\n\u201c-but it seems there\u2019s a problem with your file,\u201d the nurse finishes, cutting through his thoughts. \u201cIt\u2019s been updated a few years ago, but there seems to be a mistake.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d Tim asks, already panicking again.\nThe nurse says, \u201cI think someone has maybe been playing a misplaced joke here. It says that your emergency contact is one Mr Bruce Wayne.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Tim says as relief rushes through him, \u201cyeah, no, that\u2019s correct.\u201d\n\u201cBruce Wayne?\u201d the nurse asks sceptically. \u201cThe Bruce Wayne is your emergency contact?\u201d\n\u201cActually,\u201d comes a deep, amused voice from the door, \u201cI\u2019m a little more than that. If you turn to the second page, you\u2019ll find that I\u2019m his guardian.\u201d Bruce steps inside the room and instantly turns to Tim, now sounding worried as he asks, \u201cAre you okay, buddy? What happened?\u201d\nDespite the pain, Tim smiles up at Bruce. \u201cNothing much,\u201d he says. \u201cJust fell down some stairs.\u201d\nBruce holds up his phone. \u201cJason says you didn\u2019t text him back, so I knew something was up. You gave us all quite the scare.\u201d\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Tim mumbles. \u201cThanks for coming.\u201d\nBruce returns his smile. \u201cNo need to thank me, Tim. I\u2019ve told you. I always come for my children.\u201d\n\u00a0"
