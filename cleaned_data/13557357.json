    "summary": "<p>So this is based on a tumblr prompt by Mauraders4evr (https://www.tumblr.com/dashboard/blog/marauders4evr)<br>\"Harry Potter AU where Harry is hiding in the cabinet in Borgin and Burkes. And he sees Lucius grab Draco with his cane. And he hears the hiss, \u201cWhat did I tell you?\u201d And he hears the quiver in the blonde boy\u2019s voice, \u201cDon\u2019t touch anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>And Harry knows.</p>\n<p>Because he\u2019s used the voice that Draco uses for the past twelve years.</p>\n<p>He knows.</p>\n<p>Because now that he\u2019s lived with the Weasleys for over a month, he knows that that\u2019s not the way that a father\u2019s voice should be.</p>\n<p>He knows...\"</p>\n<p>And it wouldn't leave me alone so...</p>\n<p>Wow, so I absolutely did not intend to make this the longest chapter I've written so far, but I just love the duelling club scene and thought it would be so much fun to explore it with the new dynamic I've created between the characters. Also, I'm super excited, because now this document is 102 pages, double spaced- yay! Anyway, we are beginning to wind down with the chamber arc, and I'm really excited for you guys to see how I plan to wrap it up. Then we are gonna have Christmas and meet Narcissa's muggle girlfriend! Yay! I am also so excited to go into year three, it's gonna be so much fun. Anyway, sorry I haven't updated in a bit. I was really on a roll with this story, but then Thursday I had like six hours of homework and yesterday I got distracted reading fanfiction when I meant to write it. Ooops...<br>Anyway, lots of love (unless you're an asshole),<br>Mod des ;)</p>",
    "notes": "<p>Okay, so this is obviously gonna be way different from canon (the slytherins aren't mindless evil-doers, somebody does something about the Dursley's... etc) and some of the ideas for this fic (like Harry's extra-sensory perception of magic) are my own details. I'm not entirely sure where I'm going with this but I honestly cannot wait to get there. Me and my fickle muse (Bassy the Basilisk) hope you enjoy it. Well, I hope you enjoy it; Bassy's still mad that I won't let her slither out and eat any of you. Love forever (unless you're an asshole),<br>Des ;)</p>\n<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#work_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)</p>\n<p>TW: A lot of child abuse referenced in this chapter.</p>\n<p>Another chapter- the longest so far, and the last for the night, unfortunately. But I'm quite proud of this one. They go back to Hogwarts, I've changed a lot from canon, and I happen to think it's quite humourous. Although... I've been told I'm only funny to myself, so who knows? Anyway, enjoy! <br>Lots of love (unless you're an asshole),<br>Des ;)</p>\n<p>Well, this chapter's a lot less humourous than the last one, but I happen to think it's very good and shocking (and uniquely my own) although you're free to disagree. I hope you enjoy, though.<br>Lots of love (unless you're an asshole),<br>Des ;)</p>\n<p>This chapter is a bit shorter (only about 800 words) and more of a filler than anything, but I was still angry with Dumblefore and wanted an excuse to yell at him some more, so here you go.</p>\n<p>So, next chapter! Quick note, in this version, Harry is not a horcrux (there still are Horcruxes, but Harry isn't one. It just doesn't work with what I have planned). This is also where the plot really gets going. Anyway, enjoy.</p>\n<p>So, this chapter is pretty long... one of the longest I've written, which I hope will satisfy as it's all I've got for the night. Anyway, we getting into the thick of things! Yay!</p>\n<p>Hey guys! So, here's another chapter. I realized today that this document for the fic is 76 pages, double-spaced, as of this chapter! That's an insane amount of writing for me to get done in the space of the week. Maybe Bassy just likes that she's working on a fic featuring her kin, lol.</p>\n<p>So this chapter is mostly just a bit of mindless h/c fluff because, heck, it's Monday, but it does have a purpose in the plot as well, as you'll see at the end. Shorter than usual, but it's one am and I'm ready to see the Sandman.</p>\n<p>New chapter; love y'all.</p>\n<p>Hey guys, last chapter for the night :/. Quick note- I've changed the timing of the quidditch game a bit to fit my plotline. And don't worry, Draco will still be on the quidditch team for slytherin, just not his second year. With everything going on and without his father to pressure him into trying out the minute he was eligible, he just didn't quite get to it this year. He will still be the seeker his third year, though, and I do plan on taking the story that far, and farther, I hope.</p>\n<p>HI! More stuffs for my pals.</p>\n<p>This chapter is a VIPP- Very Important Plot Point. Dun Dun Dun.</p>\n<p>Now we're getting somewhere! And yes, the gang is now very into muggle entertainment. And thank @Bairnsidhe for the idea for the final line of this chapter. And yes, I know snakes on a plane didn't come out until 2007. Just go with it- they still had snakes and planes in 1992.<br>Lots of love (unless you're an asshole)<br>Des ;)</p>\n<p>For what was, in the original book, a pivotal chapter, this part's rather shorter than you'd think it would be. But well, it's Minerva McGonagall, and she goes BAMF! Hope you enjoy, and that it's not too anticlimatic.</p>\n<p>Yay, another chapter! Not too much integral happening here, but it's almost 2000 words. Somehow my fluff chapters seem to always be longer than my crucial, integral plot-point chapters.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_28_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoyed. And for anyone who follows the baker street boys, yes, that was a johnlock reference at the end. ;)</p>\n<p>Not too much going on here; just a fun little chapter. Forgive me if there are more grammar errors than usual; I'm exhausted.<br>Lots of love (unless you're an asshole),<br>Mod des ;)</p>\n<p>So this is a pretty short chapter today, mainly just some filler. I'm gonna do a chapter about Christmas then another chapter or two just wrapping up second year, although there won't be too much action happening, which is also why I've been a little slow updating the past couple chapters (that and I had the flu). Then this work will be finished, but I've decided to make this a series of works. I've got ideas for the next one- It's gonna be called The Prisoner of Azkaban and the Incompetence of the Wizarding Judicial System. Then I hope to do fourth year, which I will call The Goblet of Fire and Juesus Fucking Christ what the fuck is wrong with you people?! After that, well, who knows?<br>Lots of love (unless you're an asshole),<br>Des ;)</p>\n<p>Hey, so another of my heacanon-y AU's towards the end of this chapter. Don't worry; all shall be explained eventually....</p>\n<p>Also, I don\u2019t speak Latin, but as a Spanish major I realise that the fact that I used google translate means that the translation is most likely fucked. I apologise to anyone who speaks Latin and is offended by this.</p>\n<p>Gods, this fluffy little bit was so much fun to write. We are winding towards the end of the chamber, and then it's time for the next work...</p>\n<p>LAST CHAPTER OF MY FIRST COMPLETE FIC IN THIS SERIES! YAY! I AM CRAZY PROUD OF MYSELF FOR MANAGING TO FINISH THIS. Okay, small letters now. I am so excited to start the next work in the series, The Prisoner of Azkaban and the Incompetence of the Wizarding Judicial System, and I hope to have the first chapter or two up in the next few days.</p>\n<p>Next chapter will hopefully be up soon-ish, but I've got a service project early tomorrow (don't worry, I usually have Saturday's free, it's just this one day for this one class, so weekends will probably be my most usual time to update. Well, maybe not every weekend, and maybe it will be randomly in the middle of the week. I try to make plans and life laughs at them, so, eh).</p>",
    "text": "\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry slid further back in the cabinet in Borgin and Burkes as he listened for signs of Lucius Malfoy leaving with his son.\u00a0 It was ironic that this cabinet would have been far more comfortable than his cupboard at the Dursley\u2019s if it weren\u2019t for the tangible, visible presence of dark magic cloaking the entire place, threatening to choke him.\u00a0 With effort, he did the same thing he did at Hogwarts and the Burrow so the swirling colours of the magic there wouldn\u2019t blind him- he imagined closing the \u2018eyes\u2019 in his core to the putrid black, fetid swirls of magic.\u00a0 He\u2019d been so blissfully ignorant last year, when he thought that the darkness in Quirrell\u2019s turban was merely his fear of everything, but now especially he couldn\u2019t ignore the taint of forbidden magics in the air without extreme effort.\u00a0 He wondered how anyone could.\u00a0 His vision cleared, but he could still feel it, still smell it, like rotting flesh, still hear it, like whispers from the grave.\u00a0 Which was why, despite the habit of attention to his surroundings he had developed of necessity in his many years with the Dursley\u2019s, he didn\u2019t notice how near Draco Malfoy had ventured to his hiding place until he heard his voice.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cFather, you promised you\u2019d buy me a present.\u201d\u00a0 Harry\u2019s schoolmate tried to sound confident, detached, but Harry could hear the whine in his voice.\u00a0 Notice me, it seemed to say.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot here! \u00a0What did I tell you?\u201d\u00a0 Lucius\u2019 voice was harsh and cruel.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t touch anything.\u201d\u00a0 Draco warbled, and his voice had gone from a posturing but desperate cry for attention to a warble of true fear.\u00a0 And all of a sudden Harry knew.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry hadn\u2019t spent twelve years with the Dursley\u2019s without knowing what that tone meant.\u00a0 In his case, he knew that the tone precipitated swings with frying pans and hits with belts and canes and even Marge\u2019s dog chains, knew that it meant pain and hunger and lonely nights in his cupboards trying not to cry at the thought of the new scars that further signalled him for what the Dursley\u2019s thought he was, what he had spent every moment of his life until last year believing he was: a freak.\u00a0 He assumed that all parents used that tone before they punished their children, and that his punishments were just more severe than others.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But a month with the Weasley\u2019s had taught him that loving parents didn\u2019t talk to their children like that.\u00a0 Even when the twins had created an explosion in their room, scorching the walls, Mrs. Weasley hadn\u2019t responded like that.\u00a0 She\u2019d yelled, to be sure, and George and Fred had scrubbed the wall until it shined, but her voice had not once, in the entire month Harry had been there, sounded like that.\u00a0 Hadn\u2019t sounded the way that Uncle Vernon\u2019s did nearly every time he spoke to Harry: like the sharp edge of a knife, promising retribution.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When Harry made his decision, he made it without really making a conscious decision.\u00a0 Sure, Malfoy had been a prat to him, but they were twelve, for Merlin\u2019s sake.\u00a0 Harry wouldn\u2019t have even wished upon Dudley the things he was subjected to at \u2018home,\u2019 and Dudley had claim to a good handful of Harry\u2019s many scars.\u00a0 So why would he wish it on a boy who had called him a few names?\u00a0 These thoughts flashed through his mind more in abstract concepts than actual words as he burst out of the cabinet, grabbed a very surprised blonde by the hand, and began running for all he was worth.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Malfoy, Draco, didn\u2019t seem to fully understand what was going on, but he picked up his pace and ran alongside Harry, which was good, because even after a month of being fed properly (too properly, in fact, as the rich home cooking of the Weasley\u2019s had left him running to hidden places to be sick more often than not after being starved since term ended), Harry could not drag the other boy.\u00a0 They skittered along without really getting anywhere, and it wasn\u2019t until a creepy old hag tried to shove a disembodied finger practically up their noses that Draco\u2019s brain seemed to catch up with his legs and he took the lead, grabbing Harry\u2019s overlarge sleeve and dragging him down another alleyway, and then another, and another, until Harry forgot how long they had been running.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Then they burst into the sunlight of Diagon Alley, and Harry was almost blinded, because Gringott\u2019s magic was so vivid and he was just so tired from running that the level of suppression he\u2019d been using to block out excess ambient magic was almost too much.\u00a0 As the spots cleared from his vision, he witnessed Mrs. Weasley galloping towards them like the blessed cavalry, sweet little Ginny practically being dragged along.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh Harry!\u00a0 Where have you been?\u00a0 We were so worried about you!\u00a0 Oh, I should have floo\u2019ed with you!\u201d\u00a0 It was a long moment of checking him over before she noticed the blonde beside him.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat on earth is the Malfoy boy doing with you?\u201d\u00a0 Her hands stilled from rubbing soot off his face long enough to really look at who Harry had dragged along.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry was still winded, and very, very overwhelmed, so all he managed to squeeze out was something along the lines of \u201cbad shop\u2026 dark\u2026 Lucius\u2026mean\u201d before Draco took over.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThis prat got himself lost in the floo, I presume, and he was hiding in exactly the worst possible place to be hiding, because even Crabbe and Goyle aren\u2019t too thick to tell you that his luck is absolutely terrible, and he witnessed my father being a bit of a prat, and because he\u2019s an idiot and far too noble for his own good, he comes charging out and grabs hold of me and then we\u2019re running like bloody mad.\u201d\u00a0 Mrs. Weasley looked like she didn\u2019t know quite which part of that statement to react to first, and there wasn\u2019t time, because suddenly a very dishevelled and enraged Lucius Malfoy is running at them, green light spilling out of his wand at every angle, and Harry is frozen for a minute, because he\u2019s seen the green ones before, it\u2019s right there tugging at his subconscious, if he could only remember\u2026\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And then there\u2019s no time for any more thinking, because Molly Weasley is shoving all three children behind her and pulling out her wand, maternal fire practically spitting from her eyes as she faces Lucius Malfoy, and then Draco is telling him to \u201crun, you idiot, run!\u201d And it all seems so insane as he\u2019s trying to apologize to everyone they\u2019ve nearly bowled over, and Draco is telling him to do that later, and they\u2019re already going a little bit slower than they were at first because Draco, oddly enough, is making sure Ginny is placed firmly in front of him so they can\u2019t misplace her, and everything seems to blur around him in a flurry of sensation and oh Merlin are those magical colours or is he about to lose consciousness?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Then there\u2019s a veritable flock of redheads crying \u201cWhere could he be?\u201d and suddenly Fred and George crying \u201cfound him!\u201d as one and they\u2019re in front of Flourish and Blotts.\u00a0 Then everything seems to calm down for just a moment before it all goes further to hell.\u00a0 Because suddenly there\u2019s Mrs. Weasley, and she\u2019s been chased into the storefront and hit with some kind of stunner that Harry can feel is darker than a stunner is supposed to be, and it smells like ozone and sounds like the sizzle of a hot pan when you run it under cold water and then Arthur Weasley\u2019s face is redder than his hair as he launches himself, wandless, at Lucius Malfoy, who is so surprised that he too, drops his wand.\u00a0 Two adults are rolling on the floor like angry muggle school children, ripping robes and hair and punching as Harry tries to make it to Mrs. Weasley to see if she\u2019s okay, but is near the point of falling over himself, and Draco\u2019s arm is holding him in place and a distant voice that sounds like his school nemesis but far nicer is telling him to just sit down, dear god.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, finally, Harry, who has lost track of even what he himself is doing at that time, sees the blessed form of Hagrid pulling apart Lucius Malfoy and Arthur Weasley by the scruff of their necks, gripping Malfoy noticeably harder.\u00a0 And then there\u2019s a lot of talk, none of it which Harry can quite catch, like when Vernon is yelling at him after a hard hit to the head and he just can\u2019t focus, and then there are aurors and Lucius Malfoy being dragged away in ropes of vivid magic and some weird blonde ponce yelling \u201care you getting this?\u00a0 It will launch us to the front page!\u201d\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Suddenly Harry feels himself being lifted into the arms of one of the twins (George, he thinks, because he has a small mole on his right collarbone), and then George is saying something about how he\u2019s \u201cstill so pitifully light, even after a month of good food,\u201d and he tries to respond but he ends up drifting off to sleep against the comfortable chest, and the last thing he hears is Mrs. Weasley telling Draco that \u201cof course you can stay with us dear, we\u2019ll take care of you,\u201d as she waves off a hovering medi-witch.\u00a0\n*****\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hours later, after the streets have cleared and all is relatively quiet as everyone closes up shop, Susan Bones is returning from her shopping to meet her best friend Hannah Abbot and her parents as she realizes that she forgot to get a new diary.\u00a0 And then her eyes snag on a small black book, in good condition and blank, and sweet little Susan thinks it must be a gift from Mother Magic herself.\u00a0 Smiling to herself, she picks it up.\u00a0\nGeorge Weasley was concerned about the small child in his arms.\u00a0 Of course, George Weasley had been concerned about him since they\u2019d gone to pick him up and seen the bars on his windows and his gaunt, tired face.\u00a0 And then they\u2019d gone to get his trunk and he and Fred had shared a look because, was that a cot? Another look when they saw the blood stains on the sheets of the bed in the locked room.\u00a0 Harry clearly didn\u2019t want to talk about it though, and he was safe with them at The Burrow, so George and Fred, in silent agreement, had kept silent for the time being.\u00a0 But then Harry comes charging through Diagon with Draco Malfoy, of all people, followed by Draco\u2019s father, who looked completely unhinged, and George\u2019s suspicions grew to the point that he couldn\u2019t ignore them.\u00a0 Now he was holding his brother\u2019s best friend, who is so very light, and so tired from the exertion of the day that he doesn\u2019t even wake up when George carries him through the floo, and his unease grows.\u00a0 He goes to readjust Harry in his arms, and his hand brushes against some odd ridges under his over-large t-shirt, and the dark-haired boy groans slightly in his sleep.\u00a0 George swallows a sense of dread as he gently pulls the collar of the shirt away from Harry\u2019s neck and casts an eye at his back.\u00a0 What he sees has him choking back bile.\u00a0 As soon as the last of their eclectic group is through the fireplace, he acts.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMum, Dad, Fred- kitchen.\u00a0 Now,\u201d he says, and they listen, because his voice is as grave as they have ever heard it.\u00a0 Still carrying Harry, who he has come to love as much as any of his biological siblings, he leads the way into the cosy breakfast nook and shuts the door- the other kids will have to find out eventually, but by Merlin, they sure as hell don\u2019t need to see it now.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGeorge, what is it?\u201d Arthur asks his son, and he is afraid, because George looks like he doesn\u2019t know whether to cry or murder someone.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDidn\u2019t you guys wonder how, exactly, Harry knew to drag Draco away?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, to be honest dear, there wasn\u2019t really much time to think about it,\u201d Molly Weasley wrinkles her forehead, knowing the question can\u2019t be rhetorical.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s because he knows what to look for.\u00a0 I found this carrying him through the floo.\u201d Without any further theatrics, George slide\u2019s Harry\u2019s shirt up, and the adults gasp as Molly has to choke back a sob.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry looks like he\u2019s been tortured- his back is covered in scars, some that look years old, far too many years old on the body of a twelve-year-old, and some that are still red, inflamed welts, clearly from just before he came to stay with them.\u00a0 They can see every bone in his spine, even though he\u2019s been eating well for a month, and Arthur and Molly know that they don\u2019t want to know what the poor child looked like a month ago.\u00a0 They thought their boys had been exaggerating when they claimed Harry was living off scraps, but clearly \u2018scraps\u2019 was a charitable term for whatever food his relatives had seen fit to give him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The world seems frozen for a moment, and it\u2019s like the kitchen in The Burrow has suddenly become a liminal space, the most horrible liminal space one could possibly imagine.\u00a0 Then Harry stirs, and everything springs into a flurry of activity.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Molly casts a sleeping spell on the little Potter- he doesn\u2019t need to be awake for what\u2019s going to come next.\u00a0 Then she motions her husband and her twin sons to follow her into the living room again, where three sets of eyes immediately turn to them, questioning.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ron and Draco are playing chess and the blonde looks only marginally uncomfortable, and Molly takes a moment, somewhere in the back of her subconscious, to feel proud of her son.\u00a0 Ginny is watching them, and Draco is letting her tell him where to move the pieces, because he seems to have taken an odd sort of protective position when it came to Ginny, ever since he made sure she was safe from errant spell-fire back in Diagon Alley.\u00a0 But now they\u2019ve frozen as if in a painting, astute enough to see that something is wrong, but none wanting to be the first to ask what.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou dears keep playing; we\u2019re just going to pop over to see Dumbledore right quick.\u201d\u00a0 Mrs. Weasley has injected so much false cheer into her voice that even Draco can tell their suspicions were correct.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy\u2019re you taking Harry, mum?\u201d Ginny pipes up.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s still asleep Gin, we just don\u2019t wanna wake him.\u201d\u00a0 Ginny is about to say something else, as Fred looks far too serious for this to be anywhere near the truth, but Ron interrupts.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHey Gin, how about we go show Draco our quidditch field?\u201d\u00a0 He wants to know what\u2019s going on as much as any of them, but he knows that something is seriously wrong with his best friend, and that fixing it should take precedent over everything else.\u00a0 As oblivious as he is to some things, he has the mind of a chess-master when it comes to strategizing and finding patterns, and he wants to help his parents help Harry.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAlright\u2026\u201d Ginny takes Draco by the hand, not convinced that everything is alright, but knowing when to follow Ron\u2019s lead when he has an expression on his face like the one he\u2019s currently wearing.\u00a0 \u201cC\u2019mon Draco, we don\u2019t have any fancy brooms, but it\u2019s fun to toss an apple around.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat does sound nice.\u00a0 And uh, maybe tomorrow I can owl my mum n\u2019 see if she\u2019ll send over my Nimbus.\u201d\u00a0 Draco sounds unusually shy, but Ron gives him the first genuine smile Draco\u2019s seen all day, and that\u2019s enough for him smile shyly back as they race towards the yard.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As soon as they\u2019ve ensured their younger bunch won\u2019t try to follow them into the floo, the four, well, five including a sleeping Harry, make their way to the fireplace, and Molly wastes no time calling out \u201cHogwarts\u2019 Hospital Wing\u201d in a slightly tremulous voice.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ***\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Poppy Pomphrey is organizing Potions stores for the upcoming school year when her fireplace flares to life, and she is immediately on alert, wondering who could possibly be coming in on a random Wednesday evening in the summer.\u00a0 When she sees four Weasley\u2019s and a sleeping Harry Potter, her stomach drops all the way to her sensible shoes.\u00a0 This can\u2019t be good.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d She asks, putting aside her personal anxiety in favour of being brisk and ready for business.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The group looks at each other before Arthur speaks up tentatively.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019ve accidentally discovered some\u2026 unfortunate truths about Harry\u2019s home life that require immediate medical attention.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cVery well.\u201d\u00a0 Poppy swallows around the knot in her throat.\u00a0 \u201cWhich area needs my attention?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHis torso,\u201d George responds, setting Harry on his usual bed with the utmost care.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Poppy wastes no time vanishing the offending article of clothing and the entire group gasps.\u00a0 The Weasley\u2019s hadn\u2019t seen his chest yet, or the many deep scars and prominent ribs there.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2026 um, it was his back, that we saw,\u201d Fred stutters, his voice little more than a whisper, and Poppy turns him softly, needing to have a complete picture of what she was dealing with.\u00a0 This is when she loses her composure, and a sob wrenches its way from her chest.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat can we do?\u201d George prompts the woman, wanting to prod her out of her catatonic stance.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI need, I need the, um, the fireplace.\u00a0 I have to call Severus.\u201d\u00a0 Nobody groans at the name of the hated potions professor, and it truly settles on them then that things are more serious than they\u2019d thought.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSeverus- I need you here now with the following: Blood Replenisher, Fever Reducer, Anti-Inflammatory salve, Infection-fighting potions, whatever you have, Nutrient Potion, various balms for skin lesions, and\u2026\u201d she looks back at the bed, where one of Harry\u2019s prominent ribs looks bent out of its proper shape, \u201can extra bottle of skele-grow.\u00a0 Now!\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Severus Snape has no idea why Poppy would need these potions immediately in the middle of the summer, but he\u2019s learned not to question her in his years of working with her to create potions for the hospital wing, so he grabs everything on her list with years of learned efficiency and steps through the fireplace to the hospital wing.\u00a0 At first, he\u2019s not sure why he\u2019s here, but then his eyes snag on Harry Potter, the son of his enemy and his beloved best friend, in a state that Severus remembers all too well from his own childhood, although he\u2019s sure he never looked that bad.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The phials in his arms go crashing to the floor, saved only by a rapid levitation spell by Molly, and Severus feels like his whole world, his whole perception, has been flipped on its head and then bashed repeatedly against the hard-stone floor.\u00a0 \u201cI think\u2026 I think that I may owe the child an apology\u2026\u201d he breathes, his whisper so soft it\u2019s almost a wheeze, and then he clamps his mouth shut and stares some more, each scar, lash, and prominent rib driving in the fact that he\u2019s failed, he\u2019s failed her, he had one job, to protect her son, and he was so blinded by his hatred that he couldn\u2019t even do that right.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSeverus, you bumbling idiot, get your arse over here and feel sorry for yourself later!\u201d All four Weasley\u2019s eyes widen, because none of them had ever heard Poppy Pomphrey talk like that, not even at the height of the war.\u00a0 It serves its purpose however, as Snape is shocked enough to mechanically move his feet to Harry\u2019s bedside and follow Poppy\u2019s instructions as they begin their work.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWeasley\u2019s!\u201d Madam Pomphrey barks, and Fred and George look up, because that is the Fred and George tone used by all the teachers.\u00a0 \u201cGo get Dumbledore, and Minerva.\u00a0 The password to the headmaster\u2019s office is \u2018Bertie Botts.\u2019\u00a0 Feel free to accidentally break something of his on your way.\u201d\u00a0 Fred and George set off immediately, not even taking the time for a sarcastic salute.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When Harry awakens, it takes him a few moments to figure out where he is.\u00a0 In the state he\u2019s in, it requires much more effort than usual to supress the vibrant sights and smells and scents and tastes of the magic surrounding the area enough for him to see the actual place.\u00a0 When he does, he begins to panic.\u00a0 \u201cHospital wing oh no oh no ohnowhatdotheyknow?!\u201d he thinks, frenzied with worry.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He becomes aware of Dumbledore\u2019s presence, and the fact that he\u2019s spoken out loud, when the old man looks down his crooked nose at Harry, eyes bereft of their usual twinkle.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cEverything, I\u2019m afraid, my dear boy,\u201d Albus says softly, and Harry\u2019s head stops spinning long enough to see that the headmaster is looking at him with pity.\u00a0 Harry is horrified.\u00a0 This is why he didn\u2019t tell anyone and dear Merlin what would the Dursley\u2019s do when they found out would he even survive the summer?!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This time Harry is sure his thoughts are quiet, but it doesn\u2019t matter as he feels Albus\u2019 magic probe his mind gently, and he\u2019s reeling far too hard to push it away.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou will not be going back there, child.\u00a0 I am man enough to admit I\u2019ve made a mistake.\u00a0 I knew you were unhappy there, and I should have kept closer oversight.\u00a0 I thought, for the sake of the protection offered, that a general state of discontent and some mutual dislike would have to be acceptable.\u00a0 This, however\u201d and he waves a hand at Harry\u2019s body, \u201cis absolutely not.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSir\u2026\u201d Harry begins, not entirely sure what he plans to say.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYour guardianship has been transferred to Minerva per her request.\u00a0 As your head of house and the fact that your relatives, your only biological relations, have been arrested, it was easily granted.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cArrested?!\u201d\u00a0 Harry gasps, and this time Albus (thankfully) does not need legilimancy to know what he is thinking.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot for child abuse, although in different circumstances, I would love to see\u2026 never you mind, he\u2019s been arrested for embezzlement and tax fraud, and as Petunia now has no means of support, she is unable to take you.\u00a0 This can stay your secret.\u00a0 Although,\u201d he continues, \u201cI would recommend you tell your closest friends, as it is unlikely you can keep it from them for long.\u00a0 Molly and Arthur are rather upset.\u201d\u00a0 Harry blanches.\u00a0 \u201cNot at you, of course,\u201d Albus is quick to amend, wondering how he, a headmaster, is apparently so terrible with vulnerable children.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m afraid I have some work to do in my office.\u00a0 Minerva will probably be by tomorrow.\u00a0 She\u2019s currently sleeping- we had to pour quite a few calming draughts into her, you see.\u201d\u00a0 And Dumbledore left.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Out of everything the professor had said, Harry found himself most upset (after the fact that he now had to tell Ron and Hermione, and oh god, Draco, about the Dursley\u2019s, of course) that it looked like he\u2019d have to spend at least tonight in the hospital wing.\u00a0 And he\u2019d been so careful.\u00a0 He\u2019d used wandless (and therefore untraceable) scouring charms to get the blood from his back and chest off his clothes and sheets, he\u2019d not changed in front of any of them, made sure they couldn\u2019t hear when his malnourished body got sick and forced him to throw up after meals where Mrs. Weasley piled too much on his plate.\u00a0 He found himself wishing that he hadn\u2019t thought he\u2019d gained enough weight to take the glamours down.\u00a0 Except\u2026 he never had to go back to the Dursley\u2019s, so that was something.\u00a0 It was also hard to process after he\u2019d been wishing in vain for so many years, and he was glad when the twins\u2019 entrance provided him with a distraction, even if their smiles did look rather forced.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHarry, old chap!\u201d\u00a0 Began Fred.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSo good to find you awake!\u201d Continued George.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe wanted to bring you a Hogwarts toilet seat, but it seems that they\u2019ve magically nailed them all down after our escapade last year.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry smiled.\u00a0 He loved the twins and how they seemed to know, instinctually, that what he needed now was normalcy.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s alright guys.\u00a0 I wish I still had the one from last year, but it\u2019s probably better that Madam Pomphrey took it.\u00a0 The Dursley\u2019s aren\u2019t too fond of modern art.\u201d\u00a0 Harry immediately wished he could take back that last sentence, because now his little offhand remarks about the Dursley\u2019s had a much darker meaning.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 George and Fred merely looked at each other and smiled tightly again.\u00a0 \u201cWell that\u2019s okay Harry, because mum\u2019s gonna put another bed in Ron\u2019s room for when you stay with us, and you can hang as many toilet seats there as you want.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As if summoned by her name, Mrs. Weasley appeared with a plate of food.\u00a0 \u201cHarry darling, you\u2019re awake.\u00a0 Wonderful.\u00a0 I\u2019ve brought you some dinner.\u00a0 But,\u201d she added with a rueful smile, \u201cdon\u2019t eat any more than you can handle.\u00a0 Madam Pomphrey and Professor Snape are going to start you on a nutrient potion regimen until your appetite improves.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cProfessor Snape!\u201d Harry\u2019s big green eyes widened.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes dear, Professor Snape.\u00a0 Madam Pomphrey needed him to help heal you, and right now he\u2019s down in the dungeon having a good long period of introspection.\u00a0 We\u2019ve all given him a good scolding, although to be honest I think he\u2019s being hardest on himself, and I expect that he\u2019s going to start being much nicer to you.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSnape\u2026 nice to me!\u00a0 That\u2019ll be so\u2026 weird.\u201d\u00a0 Taking a look at Harry\u2019s face, Molly laughed despite herself.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell I suppose you\u2019ll just have to get used to it then,\u201d she smiled, kissing his nose and setting the plate on the nightstand by his bed.\u00a0 \u201cWell, I\u2019ve got to get back through the floo.\u00a0 Everyone is currently trying to help Draco beat Ron at chess, so that\u2019s them taken care of, but Arthur\u2019s been into these things called \u2018spark plugs\u2019 lately, and I\u2019m not sure how long I can be gone without the child I married blowing up the house.\u201d\u00a0 Harry smiled at her.\u00a0 He loved the Weasley\u2019s so much.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019ll stay with ickle Harrykins until he falls asleep.\u201d\u00a0 Fred and George said in unison.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry didn\u2019t think he could ever fall asleep at this point, his head was swimming with so much information.\u00a0 To top it off, another worry came to his head.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDraco\u2026 is he\u2026\u201d Harry didn\u2019t know quite how to finish the sentence.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s fine, Harry.\u00a0 His father did sometimes get physical with him, but nothing that would cause lasting damage, and nothing that would leave a scar.\u00a0 He\u2019s perfectly healthy right now, but his dad is looking at a pretty long sentence in Azkaban for his rampage down Diagon.\u00a0 Those were some pretty dark spells he was tossing about all willy-nilly,\u201d Said Fred.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYeah,\u201d added George, \u201cand even if he wasn\u2019t looking at hard time, not even the ministry is dumb enough to leave a kid with someone who\u2019s that clearly bonkers.\u00a0 Mum and Dad have temporary custody while the aurors try to figure out if his mum was complicit in the abuse, and if she wasn\u2019t, if she\u2019s sound enough to care for Draco.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWow, so Draco\u2019s living with us now?\u201d\u00a0 Fred and George both glowed at the way Harry said us without even thinking about it.\u00a0 \u201cHow\u2019s Ron taking that?\u201d \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s actually pretty cool with it.\u00a0 We all saw how he was protecting you and Ginny back when all the craziness was going on.\u00a0 And apologized, actually.\u00a0 He said to send our apologies on to you as well.\u00a0 Ron may be a bit of a git sometimes, but he understood how it might have influenced Draco\u2019s behaviour, having a father like that with very clear expectations for \u2018how a Malfoy should act.\u201d\u00a0 Fred said, while George mimicked Draco\u2019s expressions as he\u2019d mocked the way his father lectured him about \u2018filial piety\u2019 and all that nonsense.\u00a0 Harry laughed again, and was surprised to realise that he\u2019d managed half the plate Mrs. Weasley had sent him, due to the fact that Fred and George had been feeding him forkfuls and he\u2019d absentmindedly swallowed them.\u00a0 He yawned.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, ickle Harrykins is getting sleepy, Fred.\u00a0 I dare say it\u2019s time for a bedtime story.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cRight you are, old chap.\u00a0 Let\u2019s see\u2026\u201d George thought for a moment before beginning.\u00a0 \u201cThere once was a greasy dungeon bat and two noble red-headed heroes\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Draco Malfoy was marvelling how much his life had changed in the past twenty-four hours.\u00a0 His father was in Azkaban, and Draco would be lying if he said he felt anything other than relief.\u00a0 While his father might not be as bad as some physically, only occasionally hitting him hard enough to leave bruises, he was emotionally a nightmare to live with, and the pressure to be the perfect pureblood heir was stifling.\u00a0 And Harry Potter had rescued him!\u00a0 If Draco hadn\u2019t been so worried about him, he\u2019d still be smiling and blushing hours later.\u00a0 Did this mean Harry wanted to be his friend?\u00a0 It was like a genie had granted Draco\u2019s greatest wish!\u00a0 And wait until he told Pansy and Blaise that he was friends with the Weasley\u2019s now, and that Ron was even better at chess than Blaise- they were going to be besides themselves with shock.\u00a0 But Draco knew that after that, they\u2019d be perfectly willing to make nice with his new friends, even if they were Gryffindors, because Pansy and Blaise were his best friends, and they trusted him to know what he wanted.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The only thing that worried Draco was his mother.\u00a0 She loved him, surely, and she had tried to balance out his father\u2019s rougher side, so he hoped he was able to live with her again.\u00a0 It\u2019s not like she\u2019d chosen to marry Lucius, after all.\u00a0 That was all her father\u2019s idea.\u00a0 And if his mother couldn\u2019t take him, who would?\u00a0 The Weasley\u2019s couldn\u2019t take him forever- they had their own family to support, and as bad as Draco felt for making fun of them before, it is true that having an extra mouth to feed would be a real strain for them.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDraco,\u201d one of the redheads- Ron this time- poked him in the side.\u00a0 \u201cStop worrying. \u00a0Everything\u2019s gonna work out.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWith me maybe,\u201d Draco countered, \u201cbut what about Pott- Harry?\u00a0 Why is he still at Hogwarts?\u00a0 They wouldn\u2019t be keeping him there overnight unless he was in the hospital wing.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMaybe he\u2019s just over-exhausted, y\u2019know, from all the excitement, so Madam Pomphrey decided to keep him for the night, like for observation or something,\u201d Ron ventured.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWeasel,\u201d Draco huffed, exasperated, but lacking malice, \u201cc\u2019mon.\u00a0 You\u2019ve seen Harry ride out a bucking broom, fall off of it, catch the snitch in his mouth and walk away like nothing happened.\u00a0 Do you really believe he\u2019d be bested by a little running unless there was something else wrong?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI was just trying to be positive\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBeing positive gets you killed.\u00a0 Think, Weasel, think!\u201d\u00a0 Draco made the motion of hitting his palm against his forehead while exhaling huffily.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re friends now\u2026\u201d Ron grumbled, but still offered Draco one of his pepper imps.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIf anyone wants to know what I think,\u201d Ginny piped up.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s that your both idiots.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The two boys, both smoking at the ears from the candy, turned to look at her, affronted.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOi!\u00a0 Why\u2019s that?\u201d Ron took another candy from the bag and threw it at his sister, who deftly caught it and popped it in her mouth.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ginny took her time chewing the imp before she answered.\u00a0 \u201cWell, think about it.\u00a0 You guys went to get Harry in the flying car,\u201d Draco\u2019s eyes widened at \u2018flying car,\u2019 but he kept his mouth shut.\u00a0 \u201cYou find him locked in his room with bars on his window and looking like he\u2019s been put through the ringer.\u00a0 Then he just knows there\u2019s something wrong with your home life from witnessing one interaction with your father, Draco?\u00a0 The Dursley\u2019s were obviously abusing him, and that\u2019s why mum and dad and the twins were in such a hurry to get to Hogwarts.\u00a0 It\u2019s Dumbledore who put him with those awful muggles after all, and haven\u2019t you seen mummy giving Harry worried looks all month?\u00a0 She\u2019s obviously gone to give the headmaster a piece of her mind, and it must be pretty bad if Harry\u2019s still there\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The boys\u2019 eyes widened, and they looked at each other, swallowing nervously.\u00a0 \u201cWhy didn\u2019t he tell us?\u201d Ron asked.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe same reason Draco didn\u2019t tell anyone.\u00a0 He was scared and ashamed and they probably told him to keep his mouth shut.\u201d\u00a0 Draco\u2019s hands clenched slightly, but he nodded to concede Ginny\u2019s point.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut I can\u2019t believe there weren\u2019t any signs or anything,\u201d Ron said.\u00a0 \u201cI mean, Draco was a right arse because he was acting like his dad wanted him to.\u201d\u00a0 Draco hit Ron on the arm, but had to nod in agreement.\u00a0 \u201cAnd Harry didn\u2019t like, show anything.\u201d\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDid he not show anything or did you just not see it?\u201d Ginny prodded.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, he was kinda weird at meals sometimes\u2026\u201d Ron mused.\u00a0 \u201cHe had this look on his face, like he wasn\u2019t sure if he was allowed to just reach out and grab for something.\u00a0 And on the train!\u201d\u00a0 Ron jumped suddenly, remembering something.\u00a0 \u201cWe asked if his relatives might be proud that he rescued the stone, and he laughed and said they\u2019d be mad he didn\u2019t manage to get himself killed.\u00a0 We thought he was joking!\u201d Ron looked absolutely stricken.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have known\u2026\u201d Draco began, only to be interrupted as Mrs. Weasley walked in.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat are you children up to?\u00a0 It\u2019s almost time for bed,\u201d she tutted, picking up various toys and games and she bustled around the living room.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMum?\u00a0 Did the Dursley\u2019s hurt Harry?\u201d Ron blurted out.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Molly dropped a book and averted her eyes.\u00a0 \u201cWell dear, that\u2019s something you\u2019re just going to have to talk to him about,\u201d she muttered, and the three knew that that was an unfortunate \u2018yes.\u2019\u00a0 \u201cNow, why don\u2019t you run along to bed and you can see Harry tomorrow if he\u2019s feeling well enough.\u00a0 Off you go.\u00a0 Draco, I\u2019m sure Ron can loan you an extra pair of pyjamas, although they might be a little big\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnything you can give me will be fine, ma\u2019am,\u201d Draco said.\u00a0 \u201cThank you for\u2026 for being so nice to me.\u00a0 I know I don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNone of us can help being victims of circumstance, dear.\u00a0 We\u2019re just glad things are going to be better for you from here on out.\u00a0 Now sleep tight, and don\u2019t mind the ghoul.\u00a0 He\u2019s harmless.\u201d\u00a0 Draco looked a bit taken aback but then nodded.\u00a0 On an impulse, he reached out and hugged Mrs. Weasley.\u00a0 She looked a bit surprised, indeed Draco was surprised himself, but it could never be said of Mrs. Weasley that she didn\u2019t have a hug for everyone who needed him, so she took him further into her arms and hugged him back, and by the time the three slinked off to bed for an anxious night\u2019s rest, Draco at least felt like things might be looking up from here.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Minerva McGonagall woke up the next morning and immediately headed for the hospital wing.\u00a0 She wasn\u2019t done yelling at Dumbledore, but her child came first (although honestly, she\u2019d made it very clear from the beginning that Harry was not going to be well-treated in a place like that.\u00a0 Why she\u2019d listened to the man, as if he were God or something, well, she wasn\u2019t quite sure she\u2019d ever forgive herself for that).\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Minnie found her little boy sleeping angelically on his bed, long dark eyelashes brushing toffee-coloured cheeks.\u00a0 The next thing she noticed was Dumbledore sitting haggardly in a chair beside the bed, looking as if he\u2019d passed a rough night.\u00a0 \u201cGood,\u201d Minerva thought vindictively, which was most unlike her, but she\u2019d be lying if she said that sweet, selfless, good-mannered Harry Potter hadn\u2019t secretly been her favourite student since he\u2019d walked into the Great Hall that first day last year, blinking owlishly as if he\u2019d never seen something so wonderful.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMinerva,\u201d the headmaster greeted her tiredly.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAlbus.\u201d\u00a0 Her voice was tight, barely restrained.\u00a0 \u201cLet\u2019s go into Poppy\u2019s office and have a little talk.\u201d\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Professor Dumbledore followed his Deputy Headmistress into the office looking like a man on his way to the gallows, but who knew he deserved what he was about to get.\u00a0 Minerva shut the door behind them and turned towards the old wizard, struggling to keep her voice down.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI understand for the sake of Harry\u2019s privacy that we are not going to bring your\u2026 disgusting negligence and lack of oversight to the school governor\u2019s or the Wizengamot.\u00a0 So, I shall decide your punishment, and you will take it with your mouth shut, are we clear?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes ma\u2019am.\u201d\u00a0 Dumbledore had never called his younger colleague by the honorific before, but with the tone she was using on him there was really nothing else he could have addressed her by.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGood.\u00a0 First, I understand there was a monthly stipend from the Potter fortune going to the Dursley\u2019s for Harry\u2019s\u2026 care, correct?\u201d\u00a0 Her tone implied that she knew she was correct, and that any other answer would mean deep trouble.\u00a0 Dumbledore nodded in confirmation anyway.\u00a0 \u201cI thought so,\u201d the tabby animagus pursed her lips.\u00a0 \u201cWell, they clearly didn\u2019t use it for Harry, probably to buy more toys for that monster of a son; thusly, you will repay the total sum of all the stipends to date out of your own salary, back into Harry\u2019s vaults.\u00a0 I don\u2019t care if it doesn\u2019t really make a difference in his fortune, I will not see him having paid galleons out of his own pocket only to get it stripped out of his skin.\u201d\u00a0 Her eyes were fire, and it was clear she was only just beginning.\u00a0 \u201cFurthermore, for any classes Harry has to miss for Dursley-related health reasons, such as his severe immune-deficiency wrought by malnutrition and being beaten and worked like a slave, you will tell the other teachers to be extremely lenient.\u201d\u00a0 Her nostrils were flaring, and anyone who didn\u2019t know Minerva would have thought her animagus a dragon, not a cat.\u00a0\n\u201cFinally, any other hare-brained plans you have for this school, like putting a precious relic guarded by potentially fatal obstacles in a castle full of children, will have to be approved by me first, as I will not have you doing anything stupid that puts my child at risk.\u00a0 Now, I think I hear him stirring, so I\u2019m going to check on him.\u00a0 You, get out through the floo here.\u00a0 Harry doesn\u2019t need you to be around him right now.\u00a0 Don\u2019t let me see you near him without my permission.\u201d\u00a0 Dumbledore, suitably chastised, got up, head bent, to do as he was told, and Minerva congratulated herself on managing not to hit him in the face.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Harry woke up again to see Professor McGonagall standing over him, a worried look on her face.\u00a0 \u201cPr\u2019fess\u2019r?\u201d He slurred.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes Harry, I\u2019m here.\u201d Her eyes misted up a bit as she added \u201cI\u2019ll always be here,\u201d in a soft, emotional voice.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry looked up at her, vision still slightly out of focus.\u00a0 \u201cSo, you\u2019re my guardian now?\u00a0 Like, permanently?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes dear, permanently.\u00a0 I am, for all intents and purposes, your legal adoptive parent.\u00a0 As such,\u201d she smiled at him slyly and winked \u201cyou may call me Minerva or Minnie when we\u2019re not in class.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry looked up at her like to do so would be sacrilege.\u00a0 Minnie laughed.\u00a0 \u201cBaby steps then, we\u2019ll get there.\u00a0 Do you need anything.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry wrinkled his brows\u2026 come to think of it, he did need something, but he didn\u2019t want to be a bother\u2026\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Minerva sensed his thought process.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s alright dear, you can ask me anything.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, alright\u2026\u201d Harry ventured nervously.\u00a0 \u201cI was wondering if you could maybe draw the curtain over the potions cabinet?\u00a0 The magic\u2019s really bright.\u00a0 Normally I can block it out, but I\u2019m just so tired\u2026\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Minerva started, her mouth an \u2018o\u2019 of surprise.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry panicked slightly.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026 it\u2019s no big deal, really, I\u2019ll be fine, never mind.\u201d\u00a0 He chewed his lip.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShhh, Harry, it\u2019s alright.\u00a0 Of course, I\u2019ll close the curtain.\u00a0 I\u2019m just a little surprised, is all.\u00a0 Being able to see magic is a very rare ability.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou mean, not everyone can see it?\u00a0 Or feel it or hear it or smell it or taste it?\u201d\u00a0 Minerva had to work very hard to keep her draw from dropping to the floor.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, sweetheart.\u00a0 Those are called mage senses, and to have even one is very rare.\u00a0 To have them all together, well\u2026 that\u2019s almost unheard of.\u201d\u00a0 Minnie tried not to sound as surprised as she felt.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh.\u00a0 I was wondering how everyone else had such an easy time controlling it.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, sweetheart, we really didn\u2019t tell you much, did we?\u00a0 I imagine you felt quite overwhelmed.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Harry smiled softly at her.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, you still managed to get fantastic grades despite everything else you had demanding your attention last year,\u201d Professor McGonagall remarked, trying very hard not to think of her child half-dead, miles underneath the school.\u00a0 \u201cAnd we can at least get you some glasses that help temper extraneous magical input.\u00a0 It\u2019s probably time for a new pair anyway.\u00a0 How long has it been since you\u2019ve seen the eye doctor?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve never seen the eye doctor, Pr\u2019fess\u2019r.\u201d\u00a0 Harry looked embarrassed, like the failings of the Dursley\u2019s were his own fault, and Minerva had to fight down her anger at them all over again.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNever, sweetheart?\u201d Her heart was breaking for sweet little Harry.\u00a0 She didn\u2019t think it could break anymore after yesterday, but she\u2019d been wrong.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo.\u00a0 Aunt Petunia got those out of a charity bin.\u00a0 She said if I could see well enough to do my chores, then they were good enough.\u201d\u00a0 Harry\u2019s cheeks, which should still be round with baby fat at his age but instead were far too hollow, were red in shame.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lilly is rolling in her grave, Minerva thought, but out loud she said \u201cwell, we\u2019ll just have to take you to the eye healer once you get out of here, then.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDo you know when I can get out?\u201d he asked her, and Minerva\u2019s shattered heart gave a pang at the way he looked so like James, bored to death of being in the hospital wing after yet another quidditch accident.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnother couple of days, I\u2019m afraid.\u00a0 You have a couple of broken bones that have started healing the wrong way, so Madame Pomphrey is going to have to rebreak them and set them properly.\u00a0 You\u2019ll be sore for a while so she\u2019ll have to keep you here; it\u2019s a bit more complicated than fixing a bone the first time.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh.\u201d\u00a0 Harry sighed, but he showed no signs of complaint.\u00a0 Blessed sweet child, Minerva fretted.\u00a0 She hadn\u2019t felt so sentimental in years, not since she\u2019d reluctantly seen a little boy with a fresh lighting bolt cut left on the front steps of a quiet muggle neighbourhood.\u00a0 She\u2019d cuddled him as a tabby cat all night and wished she could keep him forever.\u00a0 Now she could, but there\u2019d been so many years of damage since then that the only thing keeping her from bursting into tears was the thought that she had to stay strong for the little boy in front of her.\u00a0 She almost asked how he\u2019d broken his wrist, two ribs and three bones in his right leg since he\u2019d left school in June, but a selfish part of her didn\u2019t think she could handle the answer, and a less selfish part of her didn\u2019t want to make Harry face it yet.\u00a0 He needed to heal physically first, then she would do everything necessary to help him, slowly and gently, through the emotional trauma.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 She cursed herself for being so macabre and forced a smile on her face, offering to show Harry some of the transfiguration on the curriculum for the next year.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He smiled as she turned beetles into buttons.\u00a0 \u201cC\u2019n I try?\u201d He breathed excitedly.\u00a0 She started to explain that not even in Hogwarts was it permitted to use magic in the summer, but the scrawny boy had already placed one slightly crooked wrist above the beetle in her hand, and, with his earnest little face scrunched in concentration, produced a (slightly shiny) button.\u00a0 Minerva gasped.\u00a0 Controlled wandless magic at his age!\u00a0 Raising Harry Potter was going to be\u2026 exciting.\u00a0 Minnie couldn\u2019t wait.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Severus Snape put his head in his hands and sighed.\u00a0 Two days in a row now, he had put off seeing Potter in the hospital wing.\u00a0 What was he even supposed to say to the child who he\u2019d relentlessly bullied for a year, turning his safe space from an abusive household into another place where he couldn\u2019t let his guard down, all because he, a professional, had schoolboy issues with the child\u2019s long-dead father?\u00a0 Had he really asked a first-year questions from a N.E.W.T.\u2019s-level textbook on the first day of term just so he\u2019d be able to take points from Gryffindor? It was all such a giant mess, a mess he, Severus, had created.\u00a0 And the thought kept circling in his head that however much he deserved this suffering he\u2019d wrought upon himself, there was an innocent child in the hospital wing suffering far worse, partly through his actions.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Snape thought back to the year that had just passed.\u00a0 Besides when he\u2019d been hovering over the boy, making him nervous, Harry had been a competent brewer, and he had a feel for the mechanics of it that pointed to years of experience in the kitchen.\u00a0 He had, on more than one occasion, shown a reckless disregard for his own safety that suggested he\u2019d never had someone care before.\u00a0 Overlarge clothes, taped up glasses with scratched lenses that still didn\u2019t keep him from squinting at the blackboard\u2026 the signs were all there, he\u2019d just refused to see them.\u00a0 He\u2019d known Harry was living with muggles, he should have realized that it would be Petunia, and that Petunia wouldn\u2019t have matured from her childhood grudges any more than he had.\u00a0 Well, less than, really, because as horrid as Severus could be, he would never hit a child under his care.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Snape sighed.\u00a0 Wallowing in pity and self-loathing were all well and good, but as much as he wanted to flee the country so he\u2019d never have to face the boy he\u2019d wronged, he had a job, and that job currently involved bringing more nutrient potions to the hospital for said boy.\u00a0 Additionally, Harry\u2019s treatment was heavily potion-oriented, and as Poppy wasn\u2019t as well-versed in potions as he was, it was his duty as both a teacher and a potions master to make sure that the regimen he was on was working for him.\u00a0 Severus swept up the phials he needed in long fingers and wrenched himself reluctantly from the sanctity of the dungeons.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When he opened the door to the hospital wing, Harry immediately turned to look at him, despite the fact that Snape had entered quietly and that the Weasley twins were loudly entertaining him.\u00a0 On the lookout for threats\u2026 another sign then, Severus thought bitterly.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry looked nervous to see him, and no wonder.\u00a0 Snape exhaled slowly and pinched the bridge of his nose.\u00a0 \u201cMr. Potter,\u201d he began in a neutral tone, \u201cit\u2019s good to see you looking slightly better.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cEr\u2026 um, thanks?\u201d\u00a0 Harry phrased it as a question, still searching for the hidden insult in the statement.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIndeed.\u201d\u00a0 He looked at the Weasley twins, who had steel in their eyes, and their unusually serious faces seemed to say be nice to our brother or else, try us.\u00a0 Severus had no intention of trying them.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMessrs. Weasley, if you would be so kind as to let me a moment alone with Potter so I may check his that everything is on schedule with his potions?\u201d\u00a0 George and Fred nodded stiffly, and Fred squeezed Harry\u2019s hand and leaned down to whisper in Harry\u2019s ear.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019ll be right outside the door.\u00a0 Cough twice if you need us.\u201d\u00a0 Severus rolled his eyes.\u00a0 Honestly, Weasleys had no sense of subtlety.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAlright Mr. Po- Harry, I know that you are, understandably, uncomfortable in my presence, so I will try to keep this brisk.\u00a0 Are you having any discomfort or odd reactions to any of the potions you\u2019re being treated with?\u00a0 Any excessive pain from the skele-grow?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cN\u2019sir.\u201d Harry mumbled, although he had a look on his face that told Severus that he did have something he was debating on bringing up.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhatever you need to say, you may say it and trust that I will not fault you for asking.\u201d\u00a0 Snape felt the need to clarify this point, as any abused child had trouble asking for something, more so for an abused child who needed something from an adult who\u2019d shown him animosity in the past.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, it\u2019s just\u2026 the potions are working great, and the skele-grow doesn\u2019t hurt too bad, and the cuts I\u2019ve got are healing real nice, but well, now that they are, they\u2019re a little itchy.\u00a0 Erm, a lot itchy\u2026\u201d Harry flushed red and looked decidedly embarrassed, as if he were confessing some taboo he had broken.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMay I?\u201d Severus asked, gesturing to the dressing gown over Harry\u2019s back and chest.\u00a0 Harry flushed again but nodded, and Severus sat him up gently and moved the fabric to look at the lesions.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh yes, they do appear to be at the stage of healing where such a reaction is common, and I can easily make something to help ease the discomfort.\u00a0 I must commend you, Mr. Potter, for not clawing at the afflicted areas like a toddler with dragon pox, as that would make both our lives a lot more difficult.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry looked dumbfounded at receiving a compliment, even a backhanded one, from Severus Snape of all people, and the man couldn\u2019t help a bitter chuckle.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI should wonder at your reaction, but I do believe that\u2019s the first nice thing I\u2019ve ever said to you, is it not?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry looked wary that to answer that question would be to fall into a trap, so Snape briskly stood up.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, I must get to brewing a salve, and I will let the twin terrors continue with their roguish influence.\u00a0 I will come back in a couple hours once it is ready.\u00a0 Do try not to scratch between now and then, as it might open the skin and risk inviting the infection we\u2019ve only just gotten rid of.\u201d\u00a0 Harry nodded once, his mouth still a wide \u2018o\u2019 of surprise at the strangeness of a civil conversation with the evil bat of the dungeons (and yes, Snape was aware of all the nicknames and rumours circulating around him.\u00a0 And no, he did not drink the blood of innocents or sleep hanging upside down).\u00a0 Snape forced his face into what he hoped was a kind smile, but probably more closely resembled constipation and left through the floo, calling \u201cPotions\u2019 lab\u201d and disappearing in a flare of green smoke.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The Burrow was a veritable hive of activity as everyone bustled about putting things away and straightening up.\u00a0 Harry was coming home today!\u00a0 Draco\u2019s mum had sent him his trunk, which he was currently trying to lug up the stairs with Ron\u2019s help.\u00a0 Ginny was picking up all the schoolbooks the others had been using to do their summer homework in the living room, Fred and George were sweeping the floor and singing along to the new Celestina Warbeck song on the radio, Molly was trying to scrub a scorch mark off the living room wall, and Arthur was sadly carting his spark plugs, the cause of said scorch mark, out back to The Shed of Banished Muggle Things.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cUh, Mrs. Weasley, the soup\u2019s boiling over!\u201d Draco called from his vantage point on the stairs.\u00a0 Ron turned \u2018round to look as well and lost his grip on the trunk.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBloody buggering hell, Ron- that was my foot!\u201d Draco cried out just as the floo flared to life and McGonagall stepped through with Harry.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMr. Malfoy! If I heard that kind of talk during the school year I\u2019d be taking points,\u201d Minerva barked.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSorry ma\u2019am,\u201d Draco mumbled, before catching sight of Harry, who was smiling slightly at the whole interaction, squeaking, and falling down the three steps he and Ron had actually managed to surmount.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOi! Draco! I can\u2019t hold this thing up on my own,\u201d Ron cried, and Professor McGonagall took pity on them and flicked her wand so that the trunk floated neatly up the stairs.\u00a0 Ron skipped down to the first floor, where Harry was trying to help Draco off the floor, and Draco\u2019s blushing face was the colour of a strawberry.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHarry, mate, you\u2019re back! \u00a0We missed you.\u00a0 Mum said we might be able to visit, but then later she said you weren\u2019t feeling up to it.\u201d\u00a0 Ron sighed as if five days without his best friend was the greatest travesty in the world.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI felt alright, but you know how Pomphrey is,\u201d said Harry, blushing and nervously scratching his neck.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m just glad you haven\u2019t completely replaced me with Draco.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWho? This git!\u201d Ron laughed, \u201che\u2019s great, but you\u2019re kind of irreplaceable.\u00a0 I\u2019ve just added him to our group.\u00a0 It was getting kinda overrun by girls, so this is really great.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWeasel, there\u2019s one girl in our group.\u201d\u00a0 Harry smiled; he didn\u2019t miss the way Draco said \u2018our group.\u2019\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYeah, but Hermione nags enough for three!\u201d Ron complained.\u00a0 Ginny came over and smacked him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou know,\u201d she said, \u201cone day you\u2019re gonna fall madly in love with Hermione, and right as you ask her to marry you, I\u2019m gonna tell her you said that.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, you won\u2019t, because even if I were to marry Hermione, which will never happen, mum wouldn\u2019t let you sabotage it.\u00a0 I\u2019m her first hope for grandkids.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd just how do you figure that, young man?\u201d Minerva had been listening and was very curious to hear this line of reasoning.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, Bill\u2019s gay, Charlie only wants to raise dragons for the rest of his life, Percy is too annoying for any girl to put up with, Fred and George scare away anyone who isn\u2019t family or crazy, although they kinda overlap, to be honest, and Ginny\u2019s gonna be a famous quidditch player who\u2019s not gonna want to start a family until later in life.\u201d\u00a0 Ron looked quite proud of this line of reasoning.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGay people can start families!\u201d Molly cried, at the same reason Ginny smacked Ron and said \u201cBill\u2019s bisexual, dumbass.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMs. Weasley!\u00a0 Ten points from whatever house you go to for your atrocious language!\u201d Professor McGonagall chastised.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShame,\u201d Draco said, faux-haughtily, \u201cI was thinking you\u2019d be good to have in Slytherin, but not \u2018worth-ten-points-right-off-the-bat\u2019 good.\u201d\u00a0 Ginny smacked him too, and stuck her tongue out.\u00a0 Minerva and Molly, luckily, didn\u2019t see, as Minnie was handing the Weasley matriarch a large bag.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThese are Harry\u2019s potions,\u201d she told the other woman, \u201cand there\u2019s a list in there of the dosages and frequency with which he must take them.\u00a0 There are a couple that have to be applied directly, so I will let you and Harry work out how that should be done and by whom.\u00a0 Harry dear,\u201d she said, redirecting her attention to the short boy talking animatedly with his friends, \u201chave fun, be safe, floo if you need anything, anything at all, and I will see you in a week, alright darling?\u201d Harry nodded, and she kissed his head of messy hair, leaving Harry blushing at being hugged and kissed by his head of house, of all people, but he hugged her back awkwardly (he was still getting used to the whole concept of people wanting to be affectionate with him, especially adults) and waved goodbye as she stepped through the fireplace and back to Hogwarts.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry looked around to see Ginny, Draco, and Ron casting curious eyes between him and the large bag of potions, and he sighed.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAlright, I guess I have some explaining to do, and you guys are my best friends, so I might as well get it over with\u2026\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The rest of the week passed in a haze of happy memories and soon it was the early morning of September the first.\u00a0 They\u2019d all been kept up late by Draco\u2019s animated impressions of \u2018Things Professor Snape Does in the Common Room,\u201d and Ron and Draco were struggling to keep their eyes open, but Harry, a natural morning person and sleeping better than ever due to the blessed and unusual absence of pain, was wide awake and chipper about going back to school.\u00a0 He\u2019d tried to enthuse about the upcoming year\u2019s transfiguration curriculum with Ron and Draco, but all he\u2019d received in response was a \u201cnrmagerd, Harry!\u201d from Ron and a \u201cShove it, Potter,\u201d from Draco, so he turned to talk to Ginny instead, who was going into her first year and thus filled to the brim with excitement to match Harry\u2019s.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They\u2019d eaten a quick breakfast (Molly was glowing with pride that Harry had managed to finish his whole plate) and packed the car, Mr. Weasley proudly and surreptitiously showing Harry the expanded trunk of the Ford Anglia.\u00a0 They piled into the car, which comfortably fit them all thanks to Arthur\u2019s tinkering, but Harry had no sooner said a silent \u2018see you next summer!\u2019 to the beloved old house when they were back for Fred and George\u2019s filibuster fireworks, then again for Draco\u2019s new Weasley sweater.\u00a0 (\u201cI had it hanging out to dry! I can\u2019t go without it- it has my name on it! And a dragon!\u201d)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By the time they\u2019d gotten to King\u2019s Cross, it was very late.\u00a0 Harry wasn\u2019t too worried- he was a hell of a runner thanks to Dudley and his gang- but Percy\u2019s fretting of \u201cI can\u2019t be late! I\u2019m a prefect!\u201d was starting to try even his considerable patience.\u00a0 He looked at Draco and rolled his eyes as they rolled into the station with five minutes before the train departed.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They rushed to platform 9 \u00be with 90 seconds to make it through, and Mrs. Weasley went through with Ginny, then Arthur with Percy, followed by Fred and George.\u00a0 Harry had just taken off at a run with Draco and Ron in his wake and a good 45 seconds to spare when\u2026 BAM! He hit a solid brick wall, and even for a kid with a considerable pain tolerance, that hurt. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Draco and Ron crashed behind him, and he got a back full of Ron\u2019s trunk (and ouch! Some of those scars were still tender!) and a chest full of Draco, who, while blushing profusely, seemed strangely serene with the state of things as he made no move to get up.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ron was the first to react.\u00a0 \u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d he sputtered, getting to his feet and hauling Draco to his before supporting a still-dizzy Harry by the arm.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry blinked the rest of the spots from his vision and then looked closely at the platform, tapping the lenses of his new glasses to remove the magical suppression so he could evaluate the situation.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s not natural\u2026 Somebody purposely blocked us from getting on, and it doesn\u2019t look like any human magic I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\u00a0 Harry tapped the lenses again to restore them so that they blocked out the colours of the wall and then cast a wandless reparo on a crack in the frames.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell that\u2019s just bloody brilliant\u2026\u201d Draco grumbled, having picked up Ron\u2019s tendency towards colourful language.\u00a0 \u201cCome on, we\u2019re starting to attract attention just standing here.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They pushed their trunks back out to wait by the car.\u00a0 Ron put forth the brilliant idea of flying it to Hogwarts, but Harry and Draco vetoed that idea immediately, Harry because he actually had a loving parent that cared about his safety now and didn\u2019t want to do something that would no doubt worry and upset her, and Draco because \u201cI\u2019m not a bloody Gryffindor, thanks.\u00a0 Honestly, why I\u2019m so fond of you, Weasel, I\u2019ll never know\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, they waited.\u00a0 And waited.\u00a0 And waited some more.\u00a0 When Arthur and Molly finally did return to the car, they looked rather frazzled.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, thank Merlin!\u201d Molly cried upon seeing them.\u00a0 \u201cWe didn\u2019t see you lot get on the train, and we searched the whole station.\u00a0 Harry, is that a bruise?!\u201d Harry did, indeed, have a very large bruise on his forehead and a bloody nose that he hadn\u2019t noticed in all the excitement, both of which tend to be common results of hitting a brick wall.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe platform was blocked, Mrs. Weasley,\u201d Harry explained, sounding very nasal indeed as Molly performed a spell to fix his nose while he talked.\u00a0 \u201cSomeone did it on purpose, and the magic looked and felt really odd\u2026 I think it was some sort of creature magic.\u00a0 It sounded like it was underwater, kind of, but I couldn\u2019t smell it or taste it because, well, I hit my face,\u201d he finished, his voice going back to normal as the fretting wand moved up to his forehead.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHmm, that is strange, and concerning\u2026 well, let\u2019s get back to the house, and you can floo to school.\u00a0 And I\u2019ll have a word with Minerva about the platform as well\u2026\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The noontime traffic from London was horrendous, and the true depths of Mrs. Weasley\u2019s worry about someone trying to keep the children from boarding the train was revealed when she said \u201cArthur, maybe you ought to put the invisibility booster on and fly home\u2026 we need to get the kids to school on time.\u201d\u00a0 The three boys knew it was a thinly veiled excuse over her worry about the strange magic blocking the platform, but none of them could bring themselves to be overly concerned because\u2026 holy shit! Flying car!\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Draco especially embodied this sentiment, as he had never ridden in it at all, and he had his face pressed against the glass of the window as they flew high above the city, until the poor buggers still stuck on the highway looked like multicoloured ants in a line.\u00a0 Ron took the other window, and Harry jostled his face up next to Draco\u2019s and marvelled just as much, as he\u2019d not ridden in the car in the day when he could see everything, and it was even better now that he wasn\u2019t starving and injured and could properly appreciate being up in the air in a vintage ford.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The ride was over far too soon (for the boys, and the side of Arthur that was giddy over his flying car) and not soon enough (for Molly and the other side of Arthur, that was a responsible, worried parent).\u00a0 Yet they all climbed out and piled inside, Draco stopping to pick up an errant gnome and swing it over the fence, earning a \u201cGood Show!\u201d from Ron, and then Mrs. Weasley was absently putting a plate of sandwiches in front of them and handing Harry his nutrient potion (he kind of wished she would\u2019ve forgotten that bit; it tasted like dirty socks and rotten spinach.\u00a0 Ron said it was because it was essence of Snape.\u00a0 Draco explained that it was due to the necessary balance of magic and macronutrients).\u00a0 Harry was still making a face and chugging pumpkin juice to wash down the potion when McGonagall stepped into the kitchen.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, sweetheart, are you alright?!\u201d she rushed up to Harry, gently grasping his chin and looking him over.\u00a0 \u201cMolly said the platform was blocked, and that you hit it!\u201d\u00a0 Harry had never seen his head of house looking frantic, and supposed it must be the addition of \u2018parent\u2019 to her title that made it so.\u00a0 He\u2019d never had that before, not that he could remember, at least, so as unnecessary as he felt this particular worry was, it felt\u2026 nice.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cM\u2019fine Minnie,\u201d he mumbled shyly, and Professor McGonagall took a moment to glow in satisfaction that he\u2019d called her \u2018Minnie,\u2019 even if he hadn\u2019t realized it.\u00a0 \u201cMrs. Weasley fixed me right up.\u201d\u00a0 He smiled at the redheaded woman, who patted his shoulder gently in response.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou know, we hit a wall too,\u201d Ron grumbled half-heartedly.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cFrom what I understand, you hit Harry, and I\u2019m sure your parent has taken the time to make sure you suffered no ill effects as a result, Mr. Weasley.\u201d Minerva said primly, back to teacher mode.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mrs. Weasley mentioned that they should probably be getting back to school, and the boys and their teacher headed back through the floo, McGonagall going through alongside Harry, as nobody seemed quite ready to let him go on his own after the events in Diagon Alley that day.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was a good three hours before the rest of the school was to arrive, and Harry smiled at the thought that they\u2019d have the whole school to themselves for that time.\u00a0 Then he noticed that they were in a corridor outside the hospital wing, and his stomach sank.\u00a0 Uh oh, this can\u2019t be good, he thought to himself.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMr. Potter, I understand you hit a wall,\u201d Madam Pomphrey exclaimed, bustling up to him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYeah, but I\u2019m fine! Mrs. Weasley already fixed my face!\u201d Harry protested.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, well, I\u2019ll be the judge of fine,\u201d the medi-witch informed him, waving her wand over his head in a diagnostic charm.\u00a0 \u201cAh!\u00a0 See, you\u2019ve a mild concussion, and I wouldn\u2019t consider the headache you\u2019re indubitably suffering \u2018fine,\u2019 Mr. Potter.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut I didn\u2019t notice a headache,\u201d Harry told her.\u00a0 After his stay in the hospital wing last year, Poppy was one adult he felt comfortable arguing with.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, well, I suppose it\u2019s understandable that you wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Poppy softened, her eyes bearing a hint of just-concealed sadness.\u00a0 \u201cNevertheless,\u201d she bristled, \u201cI\u2019ll be keeping you overnight for observation.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat about Draco and Ron?\u00a0 They hit the wall too,\u201d Harry tried, using Ron\u2019s earlier argument against him as the two shot him a dirty look.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s not how I heard it- which reminds me, I need to have another look at your back.\u00a0 If you\u2019re good, you can have an ice lolly.\u00a0 Minerva, would you take those two back to their common room, please?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut I\u2019m not a Gryffindor!\u201d Draco seemed affronted at the very thought.\u00a0 Sure, he might be happy to hang out with some now, but it should be quite clear to everyone that he was the common sense and rationality of the group\u2026\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOf course you\u2019re not, dear,\u201d Madam Pomphrey muttered absently.\u00a0 \u201cBut Minerva will have no problem taking you back to Hufflepuff, I\u2019m sure\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Draco\u2019s indignant sputtering was almost enough to make Harry okay with being stuck in the hospital again.\u00a0\nMadame Pomphrey, very reluctantly, let Harry out the next morning.\u00a0 She\u2019d wanted to keep him another night, \u201cjust in case,\u201d but Harry pointed out that unless there was an actual verifiable reason to keep him, there was no point in his missing the first day of classes, and she\u2019d reluctantly let him go.\u00a0 He was happily skipping down to breakfast, and looking very much like an ecstatic Snoopy from those Peanuts comic strips he used to sneak out of the trash and into his cupboard, excited to see Hermione again for the first time since the year ended, when he was almost bowled over by the running green-clad form of someone just slightly taller than he was.\u00a0 Looking up, he saw that he was encircled in the arms of none other than Pansy Parkinson.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 His first macabre thought was that he was being suffocated very slowly for accidentally taking the House Cup out of the Slytherins\u2019 grasp last year.\u00a0 He was about to apologize and gasp please pretty please can I have some air when the pressure ceased slightly and Pansy pulled back.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cUm\u2026\u201d was Harry\u2019s very articulate response to whatever was going on.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou saved my best friend- thank you!\u201d she gasped before hugging her again, and Harry had time to register that her magic smelled like cinnamon and felt very, very hot against his skin before she let him go completely.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSorry about that,\u201d Pansy said, looking not at all sorry.\u00a0 \u201cBut I\u2019ve been worried about Lucius for years, and no one would listen to me.\u00a0 So- thanks, for getting him out and all.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cUm\u2026 it was no problem,\u201d Harry responded, scratching his neck.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pansy looked him up and down.\u00a0 \u201cYes, you\u2019ll do perfectly.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get on quite nicely,\u201d she said, patting Harry genially on the head before walking back to her table, leaving him to wonder what, exactly, he\u2019d do perfectly for.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Snape had also been on his way to breakfast when he witnessed the interaction.\u00a0 \u201cAh,\u201d he said to a gobsmacked Harry, \u201cI see you\u2019ve made friends with Parkinson, Potter.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t think it was so much making friends as it was a friendly assault, Professor,\u201d Harry responded, shaking his head.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat does tend to be the way with her,\u201d Snape chuckled.\u00a0 \u201cIf you were planning on making allies in Slytherin, I would have suggested starting with Ms. Greengrass- far more subdued.\u00a0 But when Pansy chooses someone, they\u2019ve made a friend for life.\u00a0 There\u2019s nothing for it but to accept your fate, I\u2019m afraid, Mr. Potter.\u201d\u00a0 Harry blinked at him.\u00a0 Was Severus Snape\u2026 smiling\u2026 and joking?\u00a0 Had he slipped into a coma after hitting the platform and merely imagined everything since?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Professor Snape stood smirking at him a moment longer before handing him a phial of the nutrient potion.\u00a0 \u201cWell, don\u2019t just stand there, Potter, go eat.\u00a0 I expect you to have the energy to maintain your performance in my class.\u201d\u00a0 Harry stood looking at him a moment longer before walking into the hall in a daze.\u00a0\n*******\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry was almost bowled over again as he reached the Gryffindor table, but he recognized this magical signature- the smell of old books and the feel of warm rain was uniquely Hermione.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re back!\u00a0 I was worried about you last night.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cUm, sorry about that.\u00a0 I missed you too.\u201d\u00a0 Harry smiled and hugged her back.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re doing better, then?\u201d Hermione asked.\u00a0 Harry had explained everything in a letter about the Dursleys and such the same day he\u2019d told the others in person.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYeah.\u00a0 And I just had a civil conversation with Snape, of all people.\u00a0 It felt\u2026 wrong, almost.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was Hermione\u2019s turn to laugh.\u00a0 \u201cBet it wasn\u2019t as weird as when I got Draco\u2019s apology letter.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI got a hug from Pansy Parkinson this morning\u2026 well, more of an enthusiastic attack, actually.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cFine.\u00a0 You win,\u201d Hermione giggled.\u00a0 \u201cNow drink your potion.\u00a0 I\u2019ve already made you a plate with a balanced mix of all the food groups you need.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry smiled.\u00a0 How predictably Hermione.\u00a0 He was just uncorking the phial and wrinkling his nose when Draco came over and plopped down.\u00a0 He was proudly wearing his Weasley sweater and seemed impervious to the astonished stares from the rest of their table.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHey, prat,\u201d Ron greeted, mouth half full.\u00a0 \u201cSlytherin\u2019s that way.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAs if I could possibly not know where I am amongst all this obnoxious red.\u00a0 I merely didn\u2019t want to miss Harry\u2019s face as he drinks the potion; I\u2019ve come to view it as my morning entertainment.\u00a0 Now pass me a waffle and scoot over, Weasel.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0Draco took command of the situation as if he did this every day, and Ron merely shrugged and made room as Dean, Seamus, and Neville gaped at them.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLongbottom, I assume you know what we\u2019re doing in Herbology.\u00a0 Care to divulge?\u201d\u00a0 Neville\u2019s eyes just about bugged out of his head, but he managed to squeak \u201cmandrakes\u201d in response to the questions.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh bugger, I\u2019ve heard those are simply monstrous to work with.\u00a0 You\u2019re good with this stuff, any advice?\u201d\u00a0 And just like that, Draco was integrated.\u00a0\n***\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They were listening to Neville enthuse about his new Venomous Tentacula when Harry caught sight of that blonde ponce from Diagon Alley.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh no, what\u2019s he doing here?\u201d he groaned.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s our new Defence teacher!\u201d Hermione bubbled.\u00a0 \u201cGilderoy Lockhart, teaching us! Isn\u2019t it brilliant?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cA brilliant pain, maybe,\u201d Harry grumbled.\u00a0 \u201cI read his books while I was in the hospital wing, and I think I prefer staring at a blank wall.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCome on, Harry, you can\u2019t mean that!\u00a0 Just look at all the brilliant things he\u2019s done.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou mean the ones he put in a paragraph or two about in between talking about how pretty he was?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Draco snorted and choked on his waffle, and Ron had to pat him on the back.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIs someone making fun of Lockhart?\u201d Fred and George asked, on their way out of the hall with their drinks.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCareful!\u201d Draco screeched at them.\u00a0 \u201cYou almost spilled pumpkin juice on my Weasley sweater!\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAww, is ickle Dway-Dway obsessed with his sweater?\u201d George teased.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll get another one for Christmas,\u201d Ginny told him, whacking her brother on the arm.\u00a0 Honestly, couldn\u2019t they see he loved that sweater so much because it was the first thing somebody ever made for him?\u00a0 She shook her head.\u00a0 Boys were so dense.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hermione gasped and looked at her watch.\u00a0 \u201cCome on, we\u2019re gonna be late!\u201d she exclaimed, shoving a last piece of bacon in Harry\u2019s mouth and shooing them out of their seats.\nThey were making their way to Herbology when Harry got an eyeful of a bright flash that definitely was not magic.\u00a0 He blinked the spots away to see a kid in Gryffindor robes that was almost exactly his height (Harry was actually an inch or two shorter, but this was the closest anyone had come to being his special brand of tiny that he\u2019d encountered so far).\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re Harry Potter!\u201d squeaked the first year (he must be a first year, as Harry didn\u2019t recognize him).\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m Colin Creevey! I\u2019m a muggleborn, but I\u2019ve heard all about you.\u00a0 Can I get a picture to send home to my da? He\u2019s a milkman, and he\u2019ll be so excited to see pictures of what I\u2019m doing here at Hogwarts.\u00a0 And a kid in my dorm said that if I develop it in a special potion, the picture\u2019ll move!\u00a0 And then maybe could you sign it?\u201d Colin was chattering so much he was nearly hyperventilating in excitement.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cUmm\u2026\u201d Harry started.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Draco came to his rescue.\u00a0 \u201cHarry doesn\u2019t really like giving out signed photos.\u00a0 He just wants to be treated like a regular person,\u201d he informed the boy, kneeling slightly so that he could make eye contact.\u00a0 Harry shot his friend a grateful look, and that would\u2019ve been the end of it if one Gilderoy Lockhart hadn\u2019t been walking by.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat\u2019s this about signed photos?\u201d he asked, intruding on the conversation.\u00a0 \u201cOh, Harry, I should have known it\u2019d be you.\u201d\u00a0 Harry thought this rather presumptuous, as this git had never actually met him before.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cUm, nothing,\u201d Colin stuttered.\u00a0 \u201cJust a misunderstanding, Professor.\u201d\u00a0 But the \u2018professor\u2019 didn\u2019t pay him any mind.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHey, how about I do you one better?\u00a0 You take a picture of Harry and I and we\u2019ll both sign it.\u201d\u00a0 Harry opened his mouth to refuse, but then he was being tugged to Lockhart\u2019s side, and the older man clearly didn\u2019t plan on letting go.\u00a0 His magic was cloying and smelled like cheap drug store perfume, so Harry signalled to Colin to \u2018just take the picture\u2019 so he could escape, and then he was rushing towards the greenhouses as fast as he could without breaking into a sprint.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGreenhouse two today chaps,\u201d sweet, dumpy Professor Sprout informed him, and Harry went to file in with the rest of the class when a hand gripping his shoulder from behind made him flinch and jump a mile in the air.\u00a0 He turned to face his Gilderoy Lockhart, and was suddenly very glad his wand was in his robes, because otherwise he would have been instinctually pointing it at anyone who snuck up on him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMight I have a word with Harry before class, Pomona?\u201d\u00a0 In different circumstances, Professor Sprout might have conceded, but she knew that Minerva had taken custody of Harry and could figure from his reaction to Lockhart coming up behind him that it had been out of necessity and that the child clearly did not feel comfortable around the stranger, so she brusquely denied him and waved him into the greenhouse, waving off Harry\u2019s relieved thank you and patting him gently on the back.\u00a0 Harry silently resolved to extend his mage senses a bit whenever he was walking the halls or the grounds so that he could feel Lockhart coming and avoid him the next time.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They were, as informed by Neville, working with Mandrakes, and Hermione won points for Gryffindor by reminding them that the cry of the Mandrakes was fatal.\u00a0 Draco and Ron lost points for making moss moustaches and trying to see who could do a better Dumbledore impression.\u00a0 Harry thought it was worth it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Then it was time to repot the Mandrakes and everyone rushed to grab a pair of earmuffs that wasn\u2019t pink and fluffy.\u00a0 Harry, being short and unable to elbow his way to the front very well, was unfortunately stuck with one such pair.\u00a0 Fortunately, one silent switching spell later and Draco was holding the pink monstrosities and thinking bemusedly that he had surely grabbed a green one while Harry smirked behind his hand.\u00a0 Wandless magic was awesome.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Repotting Mandrakes was hot, sweaty work, and they all marched back to the castle for a wash before their next class.\u00a0 Normally Harry put up glamours when he was in the boys\u2019 shower room so he could make it to class with time to spare, but today he waited until the rest of his dorm mates finished showering and then went in.\u00a0 Glamours were an energy-intensive spell, and to be honest, he wouldn\u2019t mind being a little late for Lockhart\u2019s class.\u00a0 Ron seemed to share the sentiment, as he waited for Harry to emerge so they could head out of the tower together, Harry fighting with his hair all the while and thinking to himself that this was the last time he used a drying charm\u2026\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Fortunately, or unfortunately, Harry and Ron were not late.\u00a0 They slid into a table in the back row, where Neville and Draco were complaining about pureblood etiquette lessons and Hermione was studiously setting up her books, nearly shaking in excitement.\u00a0 Pansy came in a moment later and slid in bedside them as they all sat waiting for their teacher.\u00a0 Harry was still struggling with a curl that was sticking straight up at the back of his head when she reached over and neatly tucked it behind his ear.\u00a0 He looked at her in astonishment.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWitchcraft,\u201d he gasped.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pansy smirked.\u00a0 \u201cYeah, well that is kinda why I\u2019m here.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cRight,\u201d Harry turned red in embarrassment.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, quit it Potter.\u00a0 Besides, your hair isn\u2019t that bad.\u00a0 It merely requires some raw talent and- what is it that the muggles say?\u00a0 A little bit of knee-joint grease.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cElbow grease,\u201d Hermione supplied.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThank you, Mia.\u201d\u00a0 Hermione was rendered speechless for a moment as she stared at the other girl, unsure how to react to being thanked by Pansy Parkinson, of all people.\u00a0 After a moment, she settled for:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s Hermione.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI know,\u201d the other girl smirked again, somehow obnoxious and endearing at once.\u00a0 \u201cBut that\u2019s so long.\u00a0 Even my name only has two syllables, ergo, nobody needs more than that.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hermione stared at her a moment longer before saying \u201cyou should probably get your books out; this should be a brilliant lesson.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pansy rolled her eyes.\u00a0 \u201cIf being good-looking were all that was required to make someone a brilliant teacher, Professor Sinestra would be world-renown.\u00a0 I\u2019m calling bullshit on this guy.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hermione looked scandalized (not by her apparent preferences, but because she had insulted a teacher, and with such crude language.\u00a0 She was still opening and closing her mouth like a fish when \u2018Professor\u2019 Lockhart walked in.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt is I\u2026\u201d he began, and that is all Harry heard before he zoned out, uninterested in hearing the man ramble on about his charming smile award or whatever.\u00a0 His mind wandered to quidditch.\u00a0 Madame Pomphrey and Professor McGonagall had confiscated his Nimbus until he managed to put on ten more pounds It was so bloody unfair, he\u2019d been playing at his current weight- or less- for all of last year, after all.\u00a0 Yes, but you were either wearing glamours or baggy clothing that hid that, his mind supplied.\u00a0 His thoughts went on in that vein for quite some time, trying to come up with an argument for why he should be allowed to have his broom back, like, right now, until a piece of paper landed in front of him.\u00a0 A reading quiz- well, that shouldn\u2019t be too bad, then.\u00a0 He had read all the books, after all, even if they\u2019d nearly bored him to death.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But the quiz wasn\u2019t on DADA techniques.\u00a0 It was a bunch of personal questions about the stupid git.\u00a0 Harry remembered the defence-pertinent information, but he had no idea what Gilderoy Lockhart\u2019s favourite colour was.\u00a0 Nevertheless, he struggled through the first few questions.\u00a0 By the time he got to, \u201cWhat is Gilderoy Lockhart\u2019s ideal birthday gift?\u201d however, he was fed up.\u00a0 He bit the end of his quill angrily and scribbled \u201chow is this even useful? Am I supposed to just go up to a troll and yell \u2018Oi, pea-brain! I know what Gilderoy Lockhart wants for his birthday, so you better back off!\u2019? I\u2019d be better off hitting him in the head with his own club.\u2019\u201d Then he put his quill down and crossed his arms in a huff, trying to ignore the many Gilderoy Lockhart photographs winking at him stupidly.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By the time their quizzes were collected, even Hermione was looking ruffled, and actually looked embarrassed when Lockhart announced she was the only one to get a perfect score (but of course she did; she was too concerned with her class performance to sacrifice a quiz grade to be cheeky like Harry did).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Then Lockhart started talking again.\u00a0 Ugh.\u00a0 When he mentioned that \u201cno harm can befall you while I am here,\u201d Harry actually snorted.\u00a0 Extending his mage senses to the covered cage, he realized that there were Cornish pixies under there.\u00a0 This should be interesting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As he expected, it was Pandemonium with a capital P.\u00a0 The pixies grabbed Lockhart\u2019s wand and threw it out the window (Harry hoped they\u2019d broken it).\u00a0 Two had picked Neville up by the ears, and it was only through the combined efforts of Draco and Seamus holding his legs that he managed to stay close to the ground instead of on the chandelier.\u00a0 Then the bell rang, and it was only their little group in the back as everyone fled, many without their things, and Lockhart asked them to \u201ctake care of it.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They were still wrangling the nasty (and fast) little buggers without much success fifteen minutes later when Ron said \u201cHarry, can\u2019t you use your magic?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat do you think I\u2019m trying to do?\u201d He retorted as he swung a book at one and flung a silent stunning charm at another and Hermione\u2019s freezing charm just missed a cluster of them as they scattered.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, your mage senses!\u201d Ron ground out, yelping as a particularly malevolent pixie bit him on the finger.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI never thought I\u2019d say this, but Weasel, you\u2019re brilliant!\u201d Draco exclaimed.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHarry, tune into the atmosphere and see if you can do anything,\u201d Hermione joined, apparently thinking it was their best shot.\u00a0 Neville, Pansy, Seamus, and Dean looked rather shocked that Harry had not only a mage sense, but mage senses, plural, but now was not the time to discuss it.\u00a0 They looked at each other and shrugged as they joined the circle protecting Harry so he could work, most putting up their wands again (except for Pansy, who grabbed a discarded candlestick, lit it on one of Seamus\u2019 randomly smoking eyebrows, and started swinging it about.\u00a0 One of them had scratched the sleeves of her favourite blouse, and she was out for blood).\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry ignored the sounds of the scuffles raging and felt around, trying to block out everything except for the pixie\u2019s specific magical signatures.\u00a0 Having no idea if this would work, he felt for the hyperactive core of one of the pixies and imagined giving it a \u2018tug\u2019 with his own magic.\u00a0 He felt the pixie jerk, and flung it back into the cage.\u00a0 Glad he\u2019d found something that was effective, he did it again, picking up the pace so that he could grab three or four at a time after he\u2019d gotten into a rhythm.\u00a0 Five minutes later, they were all safely locked away as the children wiped sweat of their foreheads.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They looked at each other for a moment and then burst out laughing, the adrenalin and sheer absurdity of the situation going to their heads.\u00a0 By the time they managed to start walking to lunch, the were out of breath from prolonged fits of giggles.\u00a0\n***\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lunch was halfway done by the time the group made it to the Great Hall, and this time Pansy too joined the group of red-clad students at their table, ignoring the stares coming their way.\u00a0 She grabbed a corn beef sandwich and ripped into it ravenously as McGonagall came their way.\u00a0 She and Draco both prepared to refuse to leave their friends, but McGonagall wasn\u2019t even paying them any mind.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhere have you all been?\u201d she asked anxiously, but looking at Harry almost exclusively as she laid out his various lunchtime potions in front of his plate.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLockhart couldn\u2019t handle the Cornish pixies he set loose and left us to deal with them,\u201d Harry grumbled, uncorking the first phial and tossing it back.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, that man!\u201d Minerva looked furious.\u00a0 \u201cTo think, Dumbledore\u2026 I\u2019ll have to have a word, why we even\u2026\u201d she eventually stopped her rage mumbling long enough to look at the group of second-years again.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIs anyone hurt?\u201d she asked again, once again looking only at Harry, who shook his head no for himself but added that a couple of the others had been bitten.\u00a0 McGonagall healed the cut on Ron\u2019s finger and then looked at Pansy\u2019s nose, which was speckled with dried blood.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMy, miss Parkinson, that is quite a nasty nip.\u201d\u00a0 She tapped the wound with her wand, then tapped it again so that it closed completely.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPans got \u2018em back though,\u201d Seamus enthused, apparently not even noticing that he\u2019d called the Slytherin by a nickname.\u00a0 \u201cShe set it on fire!\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 McGonagall looked impressed.\u00a0 \u201cTen points to Slytherin,\u201d she said.\u00a0 Then, \u201cwait, scratch that.\u00a0 Ten points to everyone who helped with the pixie conundrum.\u00a0 I wish I could terminate Lockhart right on the spot, but even if Dumbledore allowed it,\u201d the tabby animagus\u2019 face clearly showed what she thought about the fact that he surely wouldn\u2019t, \u201cno one else applied for the position.\u201d\u00a0 Then her face lit up in a smile that the Marauders would have given anything to see, as it was a pranking smile.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, I\u2019m afraid that you children will have to deal with his incompetence on your own.\u00a0 All I have to say on the matter is that any detentions that he gives you will be overseen by me,\u201d she said, emphasising the word detention in such a way that the group knew that it wouldn\u2019t actually be a real punishment.\u00a0 \u201cOh,\u201d she added, as she turned to walk away.\u00a0 \u201cTell the Weasley twins this offer extends to them as well.\u00a0 And just some completely general advice that has absolutely nothing to do with this discussion, try to ensure everyone stays out of the hospital wing.\u201d\u00a0 Then she was gone, and Hermione and Pansy were both smiling like Cheshire cats as they leant their heads together and took out a piece of parchment.\u00a0 The boys couldn\u2019t decide whether to be scared or exhilarated by this.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 At breakfast the next morning Draco got a letter from his mother telling him that she\u2019d been awarded sole custody, and he smiled.\u00a0 He wasn\u2019t really surprised however, as his mother had always done everything she could to shield him from his father\u2019s abuse, even going so far as stepping in and taking a blow meant for Draco.\u00a0 That was two years ago, and the first time his mother had directly witnessed any physical abuse.\u00a0 It was also the last time his father tried to get physical with him, as the bruise on his wife\u2019s cheek and the fire in her eyes deterred him from hitting her son again.\u00a0 With his hands, at least.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t until he got to the end of the letter that he was truly concerned.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Oh, and Draco dear, there will likely be an alarming news story in the prophet this morning.\u00a0 However much it may shock you, it is true, unlike most of that rubbish they print, and just remember that I am an adult and that I know what I\u2019m doing, that this is what I want, that I\u2019m free now.\u00a0 Oh, and do be sure to tell Harry that his parents were completely in love with only each other by the time they got married.\u00a0 And tell all of your friends (yes, even the loud but endearing Weasley brood you\u2019ve grown so fond of) that they are welcome at the manor any time.\u00a0 \n\nLove, \n\n\nMummy.\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well that didn\u2019t sound ominous at all.\u00a0 Draco looked at Hermione, who was spreading jam on her toast and humming to herself.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMia!\u201d he yelled, startling her, and she looked up, but seemed to expect that the nickname was stuck.\u00a0 \u201cHave you looked at the prophet this morning?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo\u2026\u201d she began, but Draco had already ripped the copy away from her plate, where it rested, waiting to be read, and the entire group of Slythendors (the nickname that Seamus had given them) crowded in to look as well, intrigued by Draco\u2019s reaction.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If they were expecting something shocking, they weren\u2019t disappointed.\u00a0 There was a picture of Draco\u2019s mother, wearing a loose blue muslin dress with her hair curled down her back, looking more relaxed than Draco had ever seen her.\u00a0 She was holding hands with another woman Draco didn\u2019t recognize, who had short brown hair and was wearing a muggle t-shirt and shorts.\u00a0 They were spread out on a picnic blanket in the grass, looking blissfully happy.\u00a0 Next to the pictures, there was an article even more surprising.\n\nNarcissa Malfoy Caught Snogging Muggle Woman\n\n\nBy Rita Skeeter\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nBy now, everyone knows that Lucius Malfoy is in prison for his unexplained rampage down Diagon Alley, and that it has since come out that he was abusive to his wife and son.\u00a0 Narcissa Malfoy, who has filed for a divorce and now has complete custody of heir Draco Malfoy, has created even more of a scandal as of late when this reporter managed to catch a peek of just what she\u2019s been up to.\u00a0 Hidden in a perfect spot to watch and listen, I discovered her on a romantic date with a muggle, and not just any muggle!\u00a0 This muggle, whose name is Aralynn Smithson, I have learned, has been having an affair with the Lady Malfoy for years, almost since the birth of her son!\u00a0 I was shocked to discover the truth of the illustrious pureblood\u2019s illicit philandering, as shocked as you surely are now, dear reader.\u00a0 I stayed in my spot, suffering discomfort in order that I may bring you, my devoted following, the full scoop on these juicy dealings.\u00a0 \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Lady Malfoy leaned in close to whisper in her lover\u2019s ear, and it was only through the use of a silent sonorous charm that I was able to determine what was said.\u00a0 \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m finally able to get away,\u201d Narcissa whispered lustily.\u00a0 \u201cNow we can do the thing properly.\u00a0 No more hiding.\u201d\u00a0 \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Muggle Aralynn seemed delighted by this proposition, stating that she \u201ccouldn\u2019t wait to meet little Draco,\u201d and \u201cwas so glad that things were better\u201d for her magical girlfriend. It is obviously a seriously committed relationship, as besides its duration, I personally witnessed Lady Malfoy casually performing simple cleaning charms as they got up to leave their secluded picnic spot.\u00a0 While doing magic in front of a muggle partner is not against the law, it is advised to wait until the relationship is serious, and it is mandatory to send an owl to the Obliviation Department in the event things don\u2019t work out.\u00a0 This obviously isn\u2019t the case with these two, however, as they walked away smiling, hand in hand and trading chaste kisses.\u00a0 I\u2019d have been touched if it weren\u2019t for the sheer immorality of the thing.\u00a0 \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For those who are old enough to have gone to Hogwarts with Narcissa Malfoy, however, such scandalous behaviour shouldn\u2019t strike one as completely out of character.\u00a0 It was swept under the rug for years, but those of us who attended Hogwarts during Narcissa\u2019s sixth and seventh year and were privileged enough to have access to closely guarded gossip will remember that Narcissa Malfoy nee Black\u2019s marriage contract with Lucius Malfoy was almost terminated by the latter\u2019s father, Abraxas.\u00a0 Why, you ask.\u00a0 Well, even fewer were privy to that information, but it\u2019s not for nothing I\u2019m a journalist- I have excellent contacts.\u00a0 \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I have been informed by a very reliable source (who wishes to remain anonymous due to the sensitive nature of the material) that the marriage, a result of an agreement between the not-so-happy-couple\u2019s noble parents, was almost called off because Narcissa Black had been involved in a romantic relationship with Lily Potter, then Lily Evans.\u00a0 \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That\u2019s right, readers.\u00a0 Noble Lily was not always enamoured with her husband-to-be (I have it on good authority that she more than once called the Lord Potter an \u2018arrogant toe-rag\u2019 during the earlier years of their education), and from her fourth to fifth year was involved in a secret liaison with Narcissa.\u00a0 Our beloved Lady Potter, future mother to the hero of the wizarding world and Boy Who Lived Harry Potter, was not as innocent and pure as we would have liked to believe.\u00a0 I only hope that our poor saviour is not too traumatised by his mother\u2019s checkered past.\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By the time they\u2019d finished the article, Draco was pale, but Harry was furious.\u00a0 A burst of fire shot from his hand and torched the paper.\u00a0 Ron grumbled something about embers in his cornflakes to try to ease the tension, but was unsuccessful as Harry tried desperately to control his breathing.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHow dare she say such a thing!\u201d he boomed, and the entire Gryffindor table (and the Slytherin\u2019s therein) were shocked that such a loud voice could come from such a small body.\u00a0 They had never heard Harry yell before, as he tried his best, however unsuccessfully, to be unnoticed most of the time (the only exception being quidditch, and even there the eyes of the school were just an unfortunate concession to be made for the feeling of swooping around after the snitch).\u00a0 \u201cHow dare this awful woman imply something was wrong with my mother because she liked girls too, or because she dated Draco\u2019s mum, or because she might not have been a\u2026 a virgin when she married my dad!\u00a0 How dare she!\u201d \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Draco and Hermione, who were closest to Harry, tried rubbing his shoulders gently in the hopes of relaxing him slightly, as the dining hall was starting to shake.\u00a0 Harry was doing his best to reign in his temper and his magic, but the one thing that could infuriate him beyond all reason was someone insulting his parents.\u00a0 He\u2019d had to listen to the Dursley\u2019s do it for ten years, and some of his worst beatings were from the few times he lost his temper and dared argue with them, and without the threat of the belt or the cane, he was having trouble holding it in.\u00a0 Pebbles were beginning to rain down from the ceiling of the Great Hall when McGonagall came to the table.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHarry, sweetheart, I know you\u2019re angry, you have every right to be, I\u2019m angry too.\u00a0 But if you don\u2019t manage to reign your magic in, I\u2019m afraid the ceiling will cave in.\u201d\u00a0 She murmured soft, soothing words into his ears and ran her fingers gently through his hair and along his shoulders as her child, breathing raggedly, slowly stopped shaking in anger, and the vibrations of the castle in turn came to a standstill.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere\u2019s a good boy,\u201d Minerva praised.\u00a0 \u201cSo strong, so brave.\u00a0 Come on, I think you need some time to decompress.\u201d\u00a0 As she said this, Harry, exhausted from his outburst of anger and accidental magic strong enough to shake the foundations of a thousand-year-old stone castle held together by ancient and powerful magic, swooned and passed out in his guardian\u2019s arms, and Minerva, impervious to the concerned glances of Harry\u2019s friends and the stunned stares of the rest of the school, picked Harry up as if he weighed nothing at all (which he nearly did, in her motherly opinion) and carried him out of the hall, followed quickly by Poppy and Severus, who sensed their help would be needed.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell,\u201d Lockhart said, not reading the mood at all.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m glad that\u2019s taken care of.\u00a0 Although rest assured, we were never in any danger.\u00a0 Should it have come to that, I knew just the spell to stop the shaking.\u201d\u00a0 Pansy glared darkly at him (not that the pompous git noticed) and crossed several of the more benign pranks off the list she was creating with Hermione.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Minerva rushed with Harry to the hospital wing, putting him down on his usual bed and beckoning Madame Pomphrey over to run diagnostics on him.\u00a0 She waved her wand over the unconscious boy as quickly as she could while still maintaining accuracy.\u00a0 When the results flashed, she breathed a sigh of relief.\u00a0 Then anger again as she noticed Dumbledore had followed them.\u00a0 She shot him a glare but stayed silent for the time being.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s fine.\u00a0 Just emotionally and magically exhausted.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Snape pinched the bridge of his nose.\u00a0 \u201cThe level of depletion to his core- is it dangerous?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The medi-witch pursed her lips and ran a hand through her hair, unintentionally teasing a few strands out of their tight bun.\u00a0 \u201cSurprisingly, no.\u00a0 Not even potentially.\u00a0 Around the exertion of a fifth year after O.W. L\u2019s- completely exhausting, but not harmfully so.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou mean to say that he threatened the structural integrity of Hogwarts in a fit of accidental magic and then suffered no lasting repercussions as a result?\u201d\u00a0 Snape, a man very good at hiding his emotions, seemed to have an impossible time doing it with Harry Potter.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes Severus, that is what I said.\u201d\u00a0 Poppy wasn\u2019t going to ease the potions master through his flood of newfound emotions.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMerlin\u2019s saggy balls.\u201d\u00a0 Minerva surprised even herself with the expletive.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, well, what are we going to do about it?\u201d\u00a0 Dumbledore obviously wasn\u2019t intimidated enough by the glares of his colleagues to stay silent.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t insult his dead parents, obviously.\u201d\u00a0 Severus drawled.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 McGonagall jumped in.\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t think we need to be talking about my child as if he\u2019s a miscreant or a danger to the school.\u00a0 He clearly had every right to be angry; I was furious when I saw how that Skeeter woman slandered Lily.\u201d\u00a0 Her eyes were still spitting fire.\u00a0 \u201cAnd he was able to calm himself down.\u00a0 The structural wards would have kicked in before any real damage occurred.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cStill, you can\u2019t deny that was an extreme show of magical power.\u201d\u00a0 Dumbledore stroked his beard, still looking concerned.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSo, you\u2019re going to punish Harry for having a large magical core!\u201d\u00a0 Minerva\u2019s nostrils flared.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNow, no one said anything about punishment\u2026\u201d Dumbledore began, but Minerva was finished putting up with him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSilence, Albus!\u00a0 I\u2019ve had enough of your insinuations.\u00a0 I thought I told you to stay out of the way I\u2019m raising Harry!\u00a0 Harry is, in most respects, a model student.\u00a0 The only time he\u2019s ever broken school rules was when you, Albus, were manipulating him into doing so.\u00a0 Perhaps we should view this as what it is- Harry feels safe enough to express his anger now that he\u2019s out of an abusive home, a home that you, again, placed him in, and his magic got a little out of hand.\u00a0 Accidental magic is still quite common at his age.\u00a0 And if Harry\u2019s a little more powerful,\u201d seeing the looks on her colleagues\u2019 faces, she amended, \u201cor a lot more powerful than is perhaps common, children come to Hogwarts to learn how to use their magic.\u00a0 Considering his position in the wizarding world, and those who might wish to harm him because of it, I\u2019d say that his impressive abilities can only be a good thing.\u201d\u00a0 She exhaled angrily.\u00a0 \u201cHonestly Albus, it\u2019s not as if he\u2019s an obscurial- and we should thank our lucky stars that it didn\u2019t come to that!\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 She cast a glance to Madame Pomphrey.\u00a0 \u201cIs there a reason he must stay specifically in the hospital wing?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Poppy shook her head.\u00a0 \u201cAnywhere he can rest that is peaceful and comfortable should be just fine.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The tabby animagus nodded.\u00a0 \u201cI shall take him to his room in my quarters, then.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Albus turned to face her.\u00a0 \u201cYou had a room built in for him?\u00a0 I\u2019m surprised I hadn\u2019t heard of construction in the castle.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Minerva actually growled.\u00a0 \u201cYes, well, in case you\u2019ve forgotten, you may be headmaster, but you don\u2019t own the school, and not every decision has to go through you.\u00a0 Of course, I built a room for my child!\u00a0 Unlike some people, I know how to raise a child.\u00a0 Now, I need to leave before my magic acts up.\u201d\u00a0 She picked up Harry, almost impossibly gently, and cradled him to her chest as she left.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The others also turned to go back to the Great Hall while Albus stood frozen, still stunned from being disciplined by his deputy for the second time in as many weeks.\u00a0 Just as he grasped the handle, Severus turned back.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cA word of advice, Albus,\u201d he said, and the irony of the situation was almost too delicious.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re a skilled wizard with a good heart, but perhaps you would do well to remember that you\u2019re not the only one with any authority.\u201d\u00a0 And he twirled on his heel and stalked out.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Harry hovered just out of consciousness in the most comfortable bed he\u2019d ever felt.\u00a0 As he slowly came to, he realized he was lying on a soft mattress, propped up by pillows and covered by a warm red tartan patchwork quilt.\u00a0 He could vaguely make out walls in red and gold, a pattern without his glasses that looked indistinctly blurry.\u00a0 If he\u2019d had his glasses, he would have seen the wallpaper was red with golden snitches, and that they were also decorated by various quidditch posters, with a bookshelf on one end.\u00a0 At the moment, however, all he noticed was his guardian leaning over him feeling his forehead.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cM\u2019na?\u201d \u00a0he slurred, and Minerva froze for a minute.\u00a0 It almost sounded like he said mama.\u00a0 She tried not to tear up, but her eyes got misty anyway.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes Harry, I\u2019m here.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWha?\u201d\u00a0 he struggled with his thoughts for a moment before bolting upright so quickly he startles Minerva, and Harry himself wobbled a little.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIs everyone okay? Did I break anything? Is\u2026\u201d\u00a0 Minerva squeezed his hand gently.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShhh Harry\u2026 everything\u2019s fine.\u00a0 Nothing happened.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd I\u2019m not in trouble- shouldn\u2019t I be punished?\u201d\u00a0 Minnie\u2019s heart broke again.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHarry, of course not.\u00a0 It was just some accidental magic.\u00a0 Granted, it was powerful, but it\u2019s still normal at your age.\u00a0 Especially with all the stress you\u2019ve been under lately.\u201d\u00a0 Or forever, she thought grimly.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026 I\u2019m still not sure how this is supposed to work.\u00a0 The whole thing with, well, having a good parent.\u00a0 I\u2019m sorry if I don\u2019t get it right sometimes.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, Harry.\u201d\u00a0 Professor McGonagall ran a thumb along his cheek.\u00a0 \u201cThe only thing you have to do is be a kid.\u00a0 You just have fun, play with your friends, go to class and let me take care of any problems that come up.\u00a0 If you need anything, I\u2019ll help you.\u00a0 I\u2019m your guardian now, and we\u2019re going to figure this out together.\u00a0 Okay?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOkay,\u201d Harry looked down at his hands, intertwined in his lap, and blushed.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGood, that\u2019s it darling.\u00a0 I love you.\u201d\u00a0 Minnie realized what she said and worried it would be too much.\u00a0 Of course, it was true, but she was afraid it would overwhelm him.\u00a0\nBefore she could figure out what to say, however, Harry smiled so brightly Minerva felt like the room lit up.\u00a0 \u201cI love you too.\u201d\nMinnie smiled back at him and kissed his forehead.\u00a0 \u201cI have to go teach my afternoon classes, but you should rest for the rest of the day.\u00a0 This is your room, and your glasses are on the night table.\u00a0 If you get bored and want to read a book or have a snack, just call for Plonky.\u00a0 She\u2019s my personal house elf, and she\u2019ll get you anything you need.\u00a0 Your bathroom is attached through that door,\u201d she pointed at the back wall.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ll be back as soon as the last period is over.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry blinked at her.\u00a0 \u201cThis is my room?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Minnie smiled.\u00a0 \u201cOf course, dear.\u00a0 My child gets his own bedroom.\u00a0 Now, I really have to go, or I\u2019ll be late, and then I\u2019ll never be able to lecture tardy students again with my dignity intact.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry smiled at her as she walked out and then called for Plonky.\u00a0 Considering his experiences this summer, he figured it couldn\u2019t hurt to learn about house elves.\u00a0\n***\nMinerva got to her classroom just before the bell rang (she might have run most of the way as a cat, but nobody need know that).\u00a0 Just as she was opening her door, she was accosted by Harry\u2019s group of friends.\u00a0\n\u201cProfessor!\u201d Pansy had stepped directly in front of her, demanding her attention.\n\u201cIs Harry okay?!\u201d Hermione stood shoulder-to-shoulder with her Slytherin friend.\u00a0 The boys jostled for a position where they could watch the professor\u2019s face as she gave her answer, but the girls weren\u2019t yielding their space, and quick (and eerily matching) side-eyed glares from the two were enough to have them standing still.\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s fine, children, just exhausted.\u201d\u00a0 Pansy watched her face carefully and then squeezed Hermione\u2019s hand twice, the signal for \u201ctelling the truth.\u201d\u00a0 Growing up in pureblood political circles, Pansy was an expert at reading the sincerity in someone\u2019s voice and body language.\u00a0 She was thinking of teaching Hermione, but she knew the boys were a lost cause.\u00a0 If Draco didn\u2019t get it after all these years\u2026\nAnyway, Harry was fine, and she gave a sharp nod to the professor before turning to go back to the classroom.\u00a0 The rest followed them in.\u00a0\n\u201cDraco,\u201d she ordered her best friend.\u00a0 \u201cYour handwriting is pretty; take notes for Harry.\u201d\u00a0 The blonde looked like he might argue with Pansy about her characterisation of his handwriting, but he just bit his lip and took out a peacock feather quill.\u00a0 It was for Harry, after all.\u00a0\nThey were walking out of the room an hour later when Ron poked Draco in the shoulder. \u00a0He smiled as if this were a splendid joke.\u00a0 \u201cHe already knows how to turn beetles into buttons, you know, those fancy notes are pointless.\u201d\u00a0\nDraco hit him in the shoulder.\u00a0 \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have told me an hour ago, git!\u201d\u00a0\nRon hit him back.\u00a0 \u201cI didn\u2019t say he wouldn\u2019t like to have them.\u201d\u00a0 Draco blushed.\nPansy whacked both of them in the back of the head.\u00a0 \u201cStop it, you two, and go fetch the twins.\u00a0 We have a prank assault to plan, and we\u2019re waging it gorilla-style.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cGuerrilla-style,\u201d Hermione corrected.\u00a0\n\u201cThank you, Mia.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Harry was almost assaulted by all his friends the next morning, plus Blaise Zabini and a little blonde Ravenclaw first year, who were apparently part of their group now.\u00a0 Harry shrugged.\u00a0 The more the merrier.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMisstaaa Pottah!\u201d George Weasley greeted him in a good imitation of an irate Professor Snape.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHey guys,\u201d Harry giggled, and from the head table, Snape reluctantly ceased his plans of giving the Weasley terror a detention for his unflattering role playing.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSo, Harrykins,\u201d Fred picked up.\u00a0 \u201cYou know Blaise, and this little eaglet is Luna, Ginny\u2019s playmate.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ginny smacked him.\u00a0 \u201cBest friend, doofus.\u00a0 We haven\u2019t been playmates since we were five.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGinny, don\u2019t blame your brothers for their giggledrake infestation,\u201d Luna chided.\u00a0 While that made no sense to anyone else, Ginny just sighed and smiled, plopping her arm on the other\u2019s shoulder.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIf we could all get down to business, please,\u201d Pansy declared.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe have an announcement.\u201d\u00a0 Hermione continued, pulling out the parchment she and the Slytherin had been working on since yesterday.\u00a0 The boys had dubbed it The Super-Secret List of Doom, not least because any attempts to look at it or add their input resulted in head smacks.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLET THE PRANK WAR ON ONE DILDO-DOY LOCKFART BEGIN!\u201d George whisper-shouted.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe did not approve that nape,\u201d Hermione snorted, and Harry and Draco looked at each other and gulped.\u00a0 Both of them were worried that Hermione and Pansy had started mimicking each other\u2019s inflections and mannerisms in the first two days of their friendship.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOkay, so we\u2019ve narrowed down the list of possible first pranks to four options, and we\u2019re gonna let you guys give your input on which one we should do.\u201d\u00a0 Hermione said.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYeah, but only one of them is right, so this is a test.\u00a0 We\u2019re curious as to your competence.\u201d\u00a0 Pansy added.\u00a0 Hermione nodded in agreement.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Just then, Harry heard a voice bouncing along the walls, reaching his ears.\u00a0 \u201cLet me rip.\u00a0 Let me tear.\u00a0 Let me kiiiiiillll you\u2026\u201d He started.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGuys, did you hear that?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHear what?\u201d Ron asked.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou know, that voice!\u201d Harry reiterated.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere\u2019s no voice, Harry,\u201d Fred said, looking concerned.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYeah, lil\u2019 bro.\u00a0 You\u2019re probably still a bit tired from yesterday.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYeaaahhh,\u201d Harry hummed, non-committal, but he knew he wasn\u2019t imagining it.\u00a0 He knew that type of voice- he\u2019d heard it from the snakes when he was talking with them in Petunia\u2019s garden for years.\u00a0 But he didn\u2019t want to say it here.\u00a0 Apparently, understanding snakes wasn\u2019t normal for wizards either (of course it wasn\u2019t).\u00a0 But he wasn\u2019t going to bring that up at the table; he\u2019d wait until they were somewhere more private.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He barely registered that they were going to be putting a slow-acting hair removal potion in Lockhart\u2019s shampoo and a discolouration serum in his teeth whitener as he ruminated on the implications of what he\u2019d heard.\u00a0\n***\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He pulled all his friends (including Luna and Blaise) aside the during morning break.\u00a0 Luckily, first, second, and third years had the same study period- right after the first class of the day.\u00a0 He\u2019d pulled them all into the Gryffindor common room and up to his bedroom in Minerva\u2019s quarters.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhere are we?\u201d Blaise asked, once he\u2019d shut the door and they were all seated on Harry\u2019s bed, floor, armchair, or squashy-puff seat.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThis is my bedroom.\u201d\u00a0 Harry answered, and he couldn\u2019t help being a little bit of pride leaking into his voice.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBrilliant!\u201d Ron said.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, yes, but let\u2019s talk about that later.\u00a0 We have a problem.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIs it that voice again, mate?\u201d asked Fred.\u00a0 \u201cBecause you know we don\u2019t doubt you, Harry, but\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, I know, you didn\u2019t hear it,\u201d the first year interrupted.\u00a0 \u201cBut I know it was there.\u00a0 And I know what it was.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t know not everyone could do this, but I talk to snakes.\u00a0 I know it was a snake.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou speak Parseltongue!\u201d Blaise gasped, and Draco almost squeaked in excitement.\u00a0 Pansy was excited too, but she could restrain herself, thank you very much.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s called?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, you dork.\u201d\u00a0 Draco flung an arm around his friend\u2019s shoulder.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHarry, that\u2019s really uncommon\u2026\u201d Hermione breathed.\u00a0 Oh, the academic opportunities!\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAren\u2019t the Potters descended from the Perevells?\u201d\u00a0 Pansy asked.\u00a0 \u201cThey were a really old family; I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they had some Parselmouths in their line somewhere.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPans, \u2018Mione, you can salivate over the research opportunities later.\u00a0 The point is, there was a snake, and I heard it talking about killing people!\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMaybe it was a grass snake and it was just talking about hunting mice or something\u2026\u201d Ron put forth.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYeah, did you feel it, or like, sense it in any way?\u201d\u00a0 Hermione asked, referring to Harry\u2019s mage senses.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, but it wasn\u2019t right, I\u2019m telling you.\u00a0 If there were little grass snakes running around, I would have heard them before now!\u201d\u00a0 Harry said.\u00a0 \u201cI can prove it too!\u00a0 Summon a snake.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDoes anyone know the spell for that?\u201d\u00a0 Draco asked.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou do, idiot.\u201d\u00a0 Pansy snorted.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cRight,\u201d Draco blushed and put his head down.\u00a0 Honestly, he was so flustered lately\u2026\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Draco did the Serpentsortia spell, and Harry watched carefully.\u00a0 Could come in useful\u2026\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A long black snake popped into the room, and everyone jumped back.\u00a0 Of all the snakes to summon, an adder had to pop up.\u00a0 He wriggled angrily for a moment before Harry spoke.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHello,\u201d he soothed the little (well, not-so-little) snake.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cA speeeeakerrr,\u201d the adder hissed in

leasssst.\u201d Harry gulped.\u00a0 The snake was very big for an adder, about a metre long, so hundreds of her could not be good.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0

nest-mother, but I think it should be alright.\u00a0 Let me just\u2026\u201d he summoned a terrarium beneath the sunny window and carried the snake to it, setting her on a rock.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThank you speeeeakerrr.\u201d\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0

me Du.\u201d\u00a0 Harry knew from a short Welsh unit in primary school that the name meant \u2018black.\u2019\u00a0 It certainly fit the obsidian serpent.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThank you for the help.\u00a0 Why don\u2019t you take a nap while I talk to my

\u201cYou\u2019re bitter as fuck.\u201d Pansy snorted, and it said a lot about the Slytherin\u2019s influence on her new friends that Hermione didn\u2019t scold her for her language, merely hid a laugh behind her hand.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry was already running out the door.\u00a0 \u201cMinnie\u2019s class ends in fifteen minutes; I gotta go

Blaise voiced.\u00a0 \u201cWe should follow him.\u201d\u00a0 They all stumbled up and after him, although Ginny especially did so with some reluctance (she had commandeered the puffy chair).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They never went looking for adventure, but it looked like it had found them again.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Harry ran urgently towards Professor McGonagall\u2019s classroom, but slowed when classes ended and the hallways filled- no need to cause suspicion.\u00a0 He felt his friends and their distinct magical signatures following him, Blaise in front.\u00a0 He was glad that he had a group that was willing to back him up- he remembered wishing he had friends like that for years during primary school, and he felt so lucky that he finally did.\u00a0 Of course, it would be better if they weren\u2019t trying to figure out what to do about a man-eating snake, but you can\u2019t have everything.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He reached his guardian\u2019s classroom and knocked on the door.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWho is it?\u201d Professor McGonagall

aside.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCome in, dear.\u00a0 No need to knock when it\u2019s you.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cUmm, okay.\u00a0 Thanks.\u201d\u00a0 Harry entered and wondered exactly how he was going to tell her that there was a potentially immediate danger to the school.\u00a0 He was used to taking care of his problems on his own, so this was new for him, as well as a bit of a leap of faith.\u00a0 It seemed a lot simpler in his room.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 His room, he thought.\u00a0 Given to him by his guardian, who told him he could come to her with anything.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cUmm\u2026 I\u2019m a parselmouth!\u201d he blurted out quickly.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh?\u201d McGonagall raised an eyebrow, but didn\u2019t show her surprise otherwise; she didn\u2019t want to make him nervous.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2026 I found a snake, and I really like her.\u00a0 She\u2019s in a tank in my room.\u00a0 C\u2019n I, can I keep her, please?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, of course dear, as long as she knows not to bite anyone or wander about in areas crowded with students.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOkay!\u00a0 Thanks Minnie!\u201d\u00a0 Harry smiled at her, a moment of happiness for his new pet temporarily overriding his anxiety.\u00a0 Key word: temporarily.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Minerva was still smiling because he called her Minnie when the little boy tentatively pulled at her sleeve.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHmmm?\u201d she asked, still glowing with contentment.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe also have a bigger problem\u2026\u201d Minnie\u2019s stomach sank as she saw Harry\u2019s friends inching into the room.\u00a0 If Harry thought it was a problem, especially a problem that needed an adult to solve, it had to be serious.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell I promise I will do everything in my power to help,\u201d she told him sincerely, trying not to think about when he tried to warn her about the stone and her dismissal almost got him killed.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI know you will,\u201d he smiled up at her, and despite everything he\u2019d already been through, his green eyes were so innocent and captivating it was heart-breaking.\u00a0 \u201cWell, this morning, I thought I heard a voice that sounded like a snake.\u00a0 And it didn\u2019t feel right, so we,\u201d he swept his arm towards the group, \u201csummoned a snake and I asked her- Du, that is, my new pet- if she could sense the snake too, and she said she could, and that it\u2019s a snake\u2026 a big, man-eating snake.\u00a0 And woman eating snake,\u201d he added, catching Pansy\u2019s glare.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh my\u2026\u201d Minerva gasped.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd it\u2019s really hungry\u2026\u201d Harry was about to say more, but just then, Draco gasped.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOhmygods! The Chamber!\u201d\u00a0 The other Slytherins, and Hermione, blanched.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cFuuuuuuuck\u2026\u201d Pansy groaned, squeezing Hermione\u2019s shoulder so hard her knuckles were white.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Minerva didn\u2019t even scold her for her language; hell, she was feeling a similar sentiment.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2026 no; it cannot be\u2026 it\u2026 dear Merlin, no!\u00a0 Last time it was opened, a student died.\u201d\u00a0 Minnie had to sit down at her desk, her hand reaching for Harry, as if to assure her he was still there, still safe.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMoaning Myrtle!\u201d\u00a0 Hermione and Pansy gasped at the same time.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s called the Whomping Willow, and it\u2019s not gonna do us any bloody good in this situation,\u201d Ron grumbled.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, idiot! \u00a0Moaning Myrtle is the ghost in the girl\u2019s bathroom on the first floor.\u201d Ginny sighed.\u00a0 Honestly, for a brilliant chess-master, her brother\u2026.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cFirst a troll and now a ghost!\u00a0 What the hell is wrong with the girls\u2019 lavatory?\u201d Was Ron\u2019s only response.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd you wonder why we go in groups\u2026\u201d Pansy grumbled.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, I should say we must go see what she has to say\u2026\u201d McGonagall was reluctant to bring the children to danger, but she knew Myrtle would not wish to talk to her.\u00a0 She was a prefect the year the chamber was opened, and in all the chaos, Minnie hadn\u2019t realized the lonely Ravenclaw was being bullied.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019ll wanna talk to us,\u201d Hermione said, motioning to herself and Pansy.\u00a0 \u201cShe\u2019s really sensitive with any girls who come into the bathroom; she thinks we\u2019re there to bully her.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt makes it very hard to do what we came to,\u201d Pansy added.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHarry\u2019s good with people,\u201d Ron broke in.\u00a0 \u201cHe should talk to her.\u00a0 He made Draco like us, after all.\u201d\u00a0 Draco opened his mouth to argue, found nothing to say, closed it again, and hit Ron on the arm.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cJust because it\u2019s true doesn\u2019t mean you need to say it out loud, Weasel,\u201d he pouted.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t know about that\u2026\u201d Minerva was nervous to let her child have any part in this.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s okay Minnie, you\u2019ll be right outside the door.\u00a0 And I\u2019ll be super careful.\u201d\u00a0 Harry was intuitive enough to sense the cause of her hesitation.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIf we must\u2026 alright.\u00a0 I suppose there\u2019s no way to keep you out of an issue you discovered.\u201d\u00a0 She was still reluctant, but better Harry know that she trusted him to be capable and come to her for help than have him feel stifled and go off on his own.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ***\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Myrtle\u2019s bathroom was very wet, Harry noticed as he lifted his robes and waded through to the sound of anguished sobbing.\u00a0 He was glad he was no longer wearing Dudley\u2019s old trainers; they would have soaked through right away.\u00a0 He also noticed that there was an odd patch of old and ambiguous magic over by the sinks, but he was distracted from that as the sobbing reached a crescendo.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWho\u2019s come to bother me now?!\u201d Myrtle wailed, and Harry couldn\u2019t help but smile a bit.\u00a0 No matter the situation or the age (or corporal status, apparently) teenagers had a repertoire of basic reactions in common.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m not meaning to bother you- sorry.\u00a0 I\u2019m Harry.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The sound of his voice caused the ghost to poke her head through the stall door.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re not a girl; you\u2019re a boy!\u00a0 Are you even old enough to go to Hogwarts?\u201d\u00a0 Harry sighed; malnutrition was a bitch.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m actually a second year- just really short.\u00a0 I get a lot of grief over it, too.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Myrtle perked up.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019ve been bullied too?\u201d she asked excitedly, and Harry sensed his opportunity.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMy whole life,\u201d Harry confirmed, silently apologizing to his friends- it would probably hurt them to hear this.\u00a0 \u201cMy cousin and his gang used to chase me around and try to beat me up, so I spent most of my free time hiding in a tree.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI didn\u2019t have any trees to hide in, so I always came here,\u201d Myrtle informed him.\u00a0 Then she sighed theatrically.\u00a0 \u201cIn fact, I died here too\u2026\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry had been worried about brining it up, but hearing this he was relieved.\u00a0 Not only did she bring it up, she seemed rather proud of it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAbout that\u2026 we\u2019re investigating something of the sort.\u00a0 Would you mind if I asked you about that?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Myrtle\u2019s face lit up even further.\u00a0 \u201cOh, it was simply terrible!\u201d She enthused.\u00a0 \u201cI was hiding in this stall, right here, after Olive Hornby made fun of my glasses, when I heard a boy\u2019s voice speaking some weird hissy language.\u00a0 I opened my door to tell him to use his own bathroom, and then there was a great pair of bulbous yellow eyes, and I just\u2026 died.\u00a0 Like, I sort of seized up and then I was floating away\u2026 oh, it was so strange.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Blaise and McGonagall both gasped from outside the door.\u00a0 \u201cBasilisk\u2026\u201d this word seemed to resonate with the group, and they were the most ruffled they\u2019d been all day, which was saying something.\u00a0 Harry didn\u2019t know what a basilisk was, but he figured it couldn\u2019t be good.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He walked over to the area that Myrtle had pointed to, and where he felt the strange magic.\u00a0 \u201cGuys, there\u2019s a little snake emblem here!\u00a0 I bet it opens with Parseltongue.\u201d\u00a0 He turned to Myrtle.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCan my friends come in to look at this?\u00a0 I know you don\u2019t feel comfortable with a lot of people, but we\u2019re trying to get to the bottom of what happened, of why you died.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Myrtle bit her lip but looked pleased with all the personal attention, and someone respecting her boundaries.\u00a0 \u201cGo ahead,\u201d she waved them in.\u00a0 \u201cI need to know what happened, and why it happened to me.\u00a0 I may have haunted Olive Hornby, but I lost a lot.\u00a0 It\u2019s time to put this to rest.\u201d\u00a0 For all she was damaged and depressed, Myrtle had also had decades of experience with some cognizance or other, and she wasn\u2019t immature.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The group practically fell through the door in their rush to join their friend and examine the emblem.\u00a0 Hermione and Pansy elbowed their way through first, then made way for McGonagall.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHow does it feel, Harry?\u201d was the first thing she said after looking at it for a moment.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWeird\u2026 not dark exactly, but old.\u00a0 And\u2026\u201d Harry took a deep breath and tuned in further, \u201cit\u2019s not bad in itself exactly, but somebody used black magic here a very long time ago.\u00a0 It\u2019s very faint, but it\u2019s there.\u00a0 I, I can\u2019t put my finger on it, but it feels\u2026 vaguely familiar.\u00a0 I\u2019ve\u2026 I haven\u2019t seen this exact signature before, but something similar\u2026 I don\u2019t\u2026\u201d he trailed off, not sure exactly what it was that was making him uneasy.\u00a0 Besides, what he\u2019d already said was enough to fill the assembled (including Myrtle, who decided she rather liked this nice, living boy with the crazy hair) with a deep sense of foreboding.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Minerva practically rushed them out the door, Harry first.\u00a0 \u201cThis is an immediate threat.\u201d\u00a0 She pursed her lips.\u00a0 \u201cLuckily, basilisks have an exploitable weakness.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHagrid!\u201d Hermione exclaimed, and that was all the incentive needed to head towards the groundkeeper\u2019s hut.\u00a0 But before they were halfway there, they ran into the man himself.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHagrid, thank Merlin!\u201d Minerva began, \u201cWe need to talk to you.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cC\u2019n it wait a moment, pr\u2019fessor?\u00a0 I need to talk to Dumbledore- got to get permission to do a bit of magic.\u00a0 Summat\u2019s bin killin\u2019 all ma roosters.\u201d \u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDid a say summat wrong?\u201d the large man asked as everyone in front of him blanched.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hagrid watched confusedly as there was a moment of panicked silence and anxious looks.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t understand what was so frightening about something pecking off his roosters- it was inconvenient for him, yes, but it was probably just a stray fox or some smaller magical carnivore.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut couldn\u2019t we bring in more?\u201d Harry was asking.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s a good idea,\u201d Minerva acknowledged, \u201cexcept for the caveat- for the cry of the rooster to be fatal, it has to have been hatched on and spent its entire life on the same property as the basilisk was created.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cEre\u2019s a basilisk?!\u201d Hagrid boomed.\u00a0 He wasn\u2019t excited, either.\u00a0 Even he knew that those were fatal and should not be messed with.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShhh\u2026 Hagrid, you\u2019re gonna send everyone into a panic if you just go blurting it out!\u201d Pansy reprimanded, tugging his arm to get him to look at her.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, I think we still need ta tell Dumbledore!\u201d he told the Slytherin.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Not even Minerva could disagree with the necessity to inform the headmaster, so they all headed to Dumbledore\u2019s office.\u00a0 \u201cLemon Drop.\u201d Minerva pursed her lips as she said the password.\u00a0 She never could tolerate the candies since the night when Dumbledore was happily sucking on them as he casually dropped Harry on the Dursley\u2019s doorstep.\u00a0 Harry did not seem to have the same sentiment of malcontent, his big eyes widening adorably as the staircase started rotating upward and he stared at the paintings lining the stairway.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All the children and their adult escorts piled into the office, and they all looked around interestedly.\u00a0 Harry caught sight of the brilliant red bird in the corner and gasped.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHis magic is gorgeous!\u00a0 What is he?\u201d\u00a0 Dumbledore looked at Harry and forced the usual twinkle into his eyes despite the sadness and guilt he felt over his recent interactions with him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat, young Harry, is a phoenix.\u00a0 His name is Fawkes; he\u2019s my familiar.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry scrunched his eyebrows.\u00a0 \u201cFawkes is your familiar? \u00a0But the bond feels weird; it\u2019s different than the one I have with Hedwig.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cVery astute, Harry.\u201d\u00a0 Harry didn\u2019t see how a talent he just naturally had for perceiving magic could be \u2018astute,\u2019 but Dumbledore was still talking.\u00a0 \u201cOur bond is different than a normal familiar bond because Fawkes is the familiar of all Hogwarts Headmasters, so it isn\u2019t an exclusive familiar bond of the type you are blessed enough to have with Hedwig.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHedwig is your familiar, Harry?\u00a0 That explains why you seem to understand each other so well,\u201d Hermione remarked, while Hagrid looked ecstatic that the owl that he picked out for Harry was his familiar; finding one was a lucky and fairly rare thing for a wizard.\u00a0 It was also a blessing more ways than just magically; a familiar and their wizard had an implicit understanding of each other and their lifelines were tied together, meaning that as long as the wizard or witch didn\u2019t die young, the animal would live much longer than a normal pet.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI believe we\u2019re getting off track here.\u201d\u00a0 The fact that it was George who said this only served to reinforce the knowledge that they were here for a serious problem.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHarry, you know the situation best.\u201d\u00a0 Minnie gently nudged him, and he began explaining.\u00a0 When he\u2019d finished, with occasional input from his friends, the headmaster sat back and stroked his beard.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThis is indeed a serious problem\u2026\u201d he began, \u201cbut I believe it can be dealt with quite simply.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe roosters are dead, Albus,\u201d Minnie pulled a very Snape-ish mood and pinched the bridge of her nose in irritation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat is of no consequence, as we are not going to kill the creature.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Minerva openly gaped at him.\u00a0 \u201cAnd why ever the hell not?\u201d she snapped.\u00a0 She seemed to be cursing a lot lately in her interactions with Albus.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, there is no need.\u00a0 Harry only heard the snake wake up, that does not mean that it can feed without the heir, of which there is none.\u00a0 So, we simply seal the chamber for extra protection and go on as usual and the basilisk should go back to sleep soon.\u00a0 They don\u2019t need to feed often to survive, so it will eventually return to hibernation without the heir present.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd in the meantime, Harry will just go through his lessons hearing a giant snake going on about killing people?\u201d Minnie didn\u2019t like that one bit.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cUnfortunate side effect of being a parselmouth, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d Dumbledore looked only mildly concerned.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Minnie was about to say more, but Harry broke in.\u00a0 \u201cS\u2019okay.\u00a0 I\u2019m used to hearing people tell me how much they\u2019d like to kill me.\u201d\u00a0 He kicked himself afterwards as he saw the other\u2019s faces.\u00a0 He had to be more mindful about his tendency to gallows humour when he was nervous\u2026\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell,\u201d Professor McGonagall cleared her throat awkwardly.\u00a0 \u201cWhat spell are we going to use to seal the chamber?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSomething very strong,\u201d Dumbledore said, and Minnie was glad to know that he at least had that much sense.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The headmaster cast a sonorous charm on his voice.\u00a0 \u201cAll teachers to my office,\u201d a thought flashed visibly across his face.\u00a0 \u201cExcept Professor Trelawney: you may continue whatever it is you are doing.\u201d\u00a0\n***\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The staff all entered the already crowded office.\u00a0 Snape looked especially disgruntled at being summoned.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI was in the middle of brewing, Albus.\u201d\u00a0 He ran a hand through his greasy hair.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou smell like skele-grow,\u201d Harry blurted, wrinkling his nose.\u00a0 Then his eyes widened.\u00a0 He was already nervous, and when added to his uncertainty as to how he was supposed to interact with the potions master as of late, he seemed to just be offering completely useless information.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, well- Quidditch is starting soon, and I had a feeling a little Gryffindor brat might be needing it soon enough.\u201d Severus quipped, deadpan.\u00a0 He couldn\u2019t quite keep the corners of his mouth from twitching into a smile, though, so Harry felt safe enough to stick his tongue out at him.\u00a0 Minnie shot Severus a look, one that said \u2018don\u2019t you dare give him any ideas.\u2019\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All playful banter ceased, however, when Dumbledore explained why they were there.\u00a0 Then they were at first shocked, then horrified, then grimly determined to do what they needed to do.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThis spell will need the combined effort of all of us, as it involves an immense output of magic.\u00a0 Ideally it could also use the aid of a parselmouth\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo.\u201d Minerva refused.\u00a0 \u201cYou don\u2019t seem to think there is enough danger to inform the student body to be on their guard, so there will certainly be no foolish thoughts of involving a second year in a spell that requires multiple trained adults with knowledge far beyond N.E.W.T.\u2019s level.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Flitwick, who had an extensive knowledge of the particular charm they were performing, was looking particularly stony-faced.\u00a0 \u201cI agree.\u00a0 I would sooner recommend shutting the school down than involving a child in this spell.\u00a0 We will just have to be confident that our combined prowess is enough to deal with this threat; it certainly should be if the threat is merely hypothetical, as you are suggesting, Albus.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That was that, so Harry merely led them to the bathroom, requested of Myrtle permission to do the spell in her space, and showed them the chamber.\u00a0 Then he waited outside the bathroom with the rest of his friends while the adults did the spell.\u00a0 It was complicated, taking nearly two hours, so they had a lot of time to just kick around.\u00a0 Harry had already finished all his homework for yesterday\u2019s and this morning\u2019s classes, and courses were cancelled for the rest of the day for \u2018a teacher seminar\u2019 (that\u2019s what the rest of the school thought, anyway), so he played gobstones with Draco while Blaise and Ron played wizard\u2019s chess with a portable set the Slytherin always carried, Fred and George whispered together about some prank or other, and Hermione and Pansy sat side by side, pouring over a very large book.\u00a0 Ginny laid on her stomach scribbling in a sparkly pink notebook with a muggle pen Harry had bought her, while Luna was giving her tips such as \u201cno, not quite.\u00a0 The radshanopper\u2019s tail is slightly puffier and not so long.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When the adults finally came out, they looked rather exhausted, but Dumbledore smiled.\u00a0 \u201cIt went well.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Snape grunted. \u00a0\u201cIt better have, if I have no more energy to brew.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to go take a nap.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWash your hair first,\u201d Fred mumbled under his breath.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDetention, Weasley.\u201d\u00a0 Severus snapped, but tired enough that it didn\u2019t sound as menacing as usual.\u00a0 When four redheads responded to the surname, he sighed.\u00a0 \u201cOr, which one of you demon twins- oh, never mind.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll have reason to assign another soon enough.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As he walked away, Ron whistled.\u00a0 \u201cBloody hell, someone needs to make him do that spell before every class.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cUnfortunately, Mr. Weasley, that would create an inhumane work environment,\u201d Professor Sprout remarked, wiping a hand across her sweating forehead.\u00a0 \u201cI will see you all at dinner- if I\u2019m awake for it.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The rest of the adults dispersed to their well-earned respite as well, but Minnie stopped in front of Harry first.\u00a0 \u201cYou know where my bedroom is, don\u2019t be afraid to come get me if you need anything: consider it your compensation for not getting to scream me awake as an infant.\u201d\u00a0 Harry smiled and promised he would before turning back to his game.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDraco!\u00a0 Those stones were on my side of the board!\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou said he wouldn\u2019t notice\u2026\u201d the blonde grumbled at Ron as Harry took his winning game pieces back.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 When Harry woke up the next morning, his head felt like it was full of rocks that hammered his skull when he so much as blinked; his throat was sore and he couldn\u2019t breath through his nose.\u00a0 An attempt to take a deep breath through his mouth only ended in a coughing fit that tore at his chest and already-sore throat.\u00a0 A cold then- he found it unfortunate, but force of habit kept him from even realizing that he should consider begging out of classes for the day; the thought that he could didn\u2019t even cross his mind.\u00a0 So, when Neville spoke up, aggravating the pounding in his head, what he said took him off guard a bit.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMerlin, Harry!\u00a0 You look awful; you should go to the hospital wing.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWha? Why would I do that? S\u2019just a cold,\u201d the smaller boy rasped at his friend.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell you should still go; even if it was just a cold, which it doesn\u2019t sound like, it should still be treated before it gets worse.\u201d\u00a0 Harry took a moment, somewhere in the back of his fever-addled brain, to note that they didn\u2019t give Neville nearly enough credit for his blunt practicality.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHere, Harry, you just lie back down; I\u2019ll go get Minnie,\u201d Ron said.\u00a0 Harry\u2019s friends had taken after his new habit of calling her Minnie outside of classes (of course, unlike Harry, they never said it to her face).\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry thought bed sounded like a good idea, so he fell back in and was burrowing around trying to find a cool spot on his pillow when he felt a blessedly cool hand on his forehead and the relaxing embrace of Minnie\u2019s magic, which felt like crisp Scottish evening and smelled like fresh shortbread.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He was dragged up from his half-aware fugue by her worried voice.\u00a0 \u201cYou feel quite hot, luv.\u00a0 Let\u2019s get you to Madame Pomphrey, yeah?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMm\u2019kay Min,\u201d he agreed, sure that he would regret his easy compliance later when he was stuck there bored out of his mind, but so out of it that he felt sleepily compliant and couldn\u2019t really bring himself to care.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Minerva reached for his hand to help guide him along, and Harry placed his little hand in her larger one without further prompting, practically purring as he basked in the affectionate contact.\u00a0 Even when due to sickness, Harry was much better at accepting affection when he was half asleep.\u00a0 He looked much younger than he was in his oversized Gryffindor pyjamas, rubbing his eyes with his free hands as he stumbled along after his guardian, who gently placed his glasses on his face so he wouldn\u2019t be dealing with an influx of visible magic to worsen his headache.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ***\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Madame Pomphrey merely clucked in concern when he walked in.\u00a0 \u201cThere\u2019s been a cold going around, so I was wondering how long it would be before he wandered in with a full-blown case of the flu,\u201d she tutted, feeling his forehead.\u00a0 She left Susan Bones, who had been administered a pepper-up potion and was looking a little peaky, and helped Harry into bed.\u00a0 She had to gently shake him awake twice so she could get all the necessary potions into him, and the last thing Harry noticed before truly dropping of was that Susan\u2019s magic was oddly faded for just a normal cold.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cNice snake.\u00a0 Good snake\u2026 please don\u2019t bite me!\u201d Draco screeched as he dropped a dead mouse into Du\u2019s terrarium.\u00a0 He had no idea why he\u2019d agreed when Harry asked him to feed Du while he was in the hospital wing.\u00a0 While he thought snakes were awesome and fascinating, he had no desire to actually get close to one.\u00a0 The adder merely snatched at the rodent and looked at him, as if to say really, human?\u00a0 Who\u2019s the bigger one here?\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell who\u2019s the one with poisonous fangs?\u201d Draco said out loud.\u00a0 Oh dear, he was having a conversation with a snake, and unlike his friend, he couldn\u2019t actually speak to them, so this just was just an opportunity to question his sanity.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDraco!\u201d Pansy called, \u201chave you already fed Du?\u00a0 Professor McGonagall said we could take her to Harry.\u201d\u00a0 She poked her head into Harry\u2019s bedroom.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Draco gulped.\u00a0 \u201cFeeding her was one thing, but now you want me to pick her up?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHonestly, Dray, you\u2019re such a wimp.\u201d\u00a0 His best friend rolled her eyes at him, turning to lift the lid off the tank.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMay I?\u201d she asked the adder, who laid her pretty black head across the Slytherin\u2019s hand in acquiescence.\u00a0 Pansy picked her up, avoiding the area of her mid-section that was bulging with her recent meal.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShe won\u2019t hurt you, you know.\u00a0 She knows Harry likes you.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Draco nodded shakily but stepped back.\u00a0 \u201cStill\u2026\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou are an embarrassment to our house sometimes, you know.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou can always go to Gryffindor if you\u2019re so bothered by it.\u201d Draco quipped back, and Pansy\u2019s wrinkled nose showed exactly what she thought of that idea.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI could always just trade you for Mia; I don\u2019t know what that tattered old hat was thinking when it put her here- she\u2019d be a credit to Slytherin.\u201d\u00a0 Pansy started walking towards the portrait of the fat lady before Draco could respond to the insult.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019ve bitten off more than you could chew with that one, huh dear?\u201d the portrait asked him as he in turn went to scramble through the hole.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou don\u2019t just decide to make friends with Pansy- she claims you and you\u2019re stuck with her,\u201d Draco snorted.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, I know the type.\u00a0 My girlfriend was like that; but she was fiercely loyal.\u00a0 And an excellent kisser.\u201d\u00a0 Draco awkwardly sped away at this admission.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHmph.\u00a0 Little Pansy seemed to quite like that bit of information.\u201d\u00a0 The painted lady smoothed her dress and sat down to her novel.\u00a0\n***\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDu!\u201d Harry exclaimed, voice still raspy, when he saw his friends with his pet.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo love for the rest of us, Potter?\u201d Pansy quipped, fake-indignant.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThanks Pans, you\u2019re the best.\u201d\u00a0 The corners of Harry\u2019s mouth quirked into a smile.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTell me something I don\u2019t know,\u201d she sniffed.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCan I copy your notes, Draco? \u00a0Madame Pomphrey won\u2019t let me have any of my work.\u201d\u00a0 Harry asked the other student in the room.\u00a0 But he had no sooner performed a duplicating spell on Draco\u2019s neat notes (wandlessly; Pomphrey had confiscated that as well) than the Medi-witch, sniffing rebellion, came out of her office.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ll be taking that,\u201d she said, snatching the parchments.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut I\u2019m feeling better!\u00a0 And I\u2019m bored!\u201d Harry whined.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell then I suppose you\u2019ll just have to stay bored until your fever\u2019s gone,\u201d she responded, mercilessly.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s just schoolwork\u2026\u201d her patient grumbled.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhile you\u2019re here, it\u2019s contraband.\u00a0 Besides, Minerva tells me you\u2019re already ahead in all your classes,\u201d Poppy pointed out, unimpressed with Harry\u2019s argument.\u00a0 \u201cAnd,\u201d she added, \u201cno more wandless magic, either, or I\u2019ll charm your hands to the blankets.\u201d\u00a0 Harry figured now wasn\u2019t the best time to point out he didn\u2019t actually need to move to cast wandlessly, so he just nodded and sighed.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m being punished for having a bad immune system,\u201d Harry grumbled to his friends as the nurse returned to her office.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHonestly, Harry, it\u2019s just a bed and some free time to rest.\u00a0 I\u2019d love a nap right about now.\u00a0 You\u2019re the most dramatic creature I\u2019ve ever met, unless you actually should be reacting to something, of course.\u201d\u00a0 Pansy rolled her eyes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re one to talk about being dramatic,\u201d Harry giggled, rubbing Du\u2019s scaly black head with one finger.\u00a0 Pansy could swear the serpent was smiling.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHumph, if I\u2019m going to be insulted, I\u2019ll be on my way.\u201d\u00a0 She stuck her nose in the air.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo!\u00a0 I was just kidding- please stay!\u00a0 I\u2019m bored,\u201d Harry sort-of apologized.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe'd love to, oh great chosen one, but Minnie told us to let you rest after we dropped of Du, and Mia and I have an assault on Lockhart to plan.\u00a0 You didn\u2019t think we\u2019d let him off with just thinning hair and yellow teeth, did you?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m just glad Hermione\u2019s there to keep you from going full-out evil queen,\u201d Harry told her honestly.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, you\u2019re so cute, thinking Mia\u2019s holding me back- I\u2019ve long since corrupted her,\u201d Pansy smiled like the cat that got the canary as she pulled Draco out with her.\u00a0\n***\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was two days later and classes had just ended for the week when Harry was deemed well enough to leave, just in time to head to the great hall for dinner.\u00a0 Draco couldn\u2019t figure out why he blushed when Harry walked in, rested his chin on the blonde\u2019s shoulder, and reached to nab a chip from his plate.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve already made you a plate, Harry, so you can stop stealing from Draco\u2019s now,\u201d Hermione scolded him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMmm, but he\u2019s already got vinegar on his chips,\u201d he responded, licking his lips.\u00a0 Draco blushed again and had to look away.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSit down and drink your potions; we all know that\u2019s what you\u2019re really putting off.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSnape revolutionized the sleeping draught by cutting the brewing time in half, but he supposedly can\u2019t make any of these taste better?\u00a0 I call bullshit; he wants me to suffer,\u201d Harry sighed, pulling the cork of a bone-strengthening draught.\u00a0 He finished the rest of his regimen (nutritional, immunity, respiratory, and heart-strengthening potions, all designed to combat the long-term effects of malnutrition) and reached for the pumpkin juice before saying anything else.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou good?\u201d Blaise asked as he finished chugging his drink and made a face.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYeah, anyway- I ran into Nearly-Headless-Nick, or rather, through him, on my way down here, and he invited me to his Deathday party, and I said yes.\u00a0 Anyone else wanna come?\u201d \u00a0He held up his hand and Hermione jumped up.\u00a0 \u201cI already know you and Pansy are coming for the \u2018research opportunity,\u2019 \u2018Mione.\u00a0 Anyone else?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m good, thanks,\u201d Seamus said.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMake sure you bring food; there won\u2019t be anything edible there,\u201d Neville said, having gone to more of Great-Grandfather Longbottom\u2019s deathdays than he cared to remember.\u00a0 \u201cAnd a coat, it\u2019ll be freezing with so many ghosts there.\u201d\u00a0 Seamus looked like he regret his decision now as he looked over at Dean; a freezing room full of ghosts would have been a great excuse to snuggle his best friend/crush.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI know Fred and George won\u2019t be there; they have some big Halloween prank planned,\u201d Ginny said.\u00a0 \u201cBut Luna and I\u2019ll come.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSure, why not?\u201d Blaise shrugged.\u00a0 \u201cThere\u2019s a feast every year, after all.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ll invite Millie too,\u201d Pansy cut in.\u00a0 \u201cBut nobody tells her to bring a coat; this is my chance to make my move.\u201d\u00a0 The others just rolled their eyes; Pansy\u2019s infatuation with the other Slytherin girl was common knowledge in the group.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSay what you will; at least I\u2019m aware of my emotions,\u201d she harrumphed, and once everyone had looked away she slid her eyes almost imperceptibly towards Draco, who was blushing as Harry laughed at a joke the blonde had told him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Time passed quickly the next few weeks, filled with schoolwork and social time amongst the group, who traded between sitting with the Slytherins, Gryffindors, and Ravenclaws.\u00a0 Fred and George joked that they ought to pick up a Hufflepuff next.\u00a0 The mention of Hufflepuff jogged something vague in Harry\u2019s memory, but he could never quite grasp it, so he dismissed it as unimportant.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The quidditch between Gryffindor and Ravenclaw match was scheduled for the day before Halloween, and by the night before that, Harry, who had been weighing himself obsessively all week, finally managed to put on the last of the ten pounds required to be allowed to play.\u00a0 McGonagall sighed at him fondly when he went bursting into her office to show her.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cVery well,\u201d she said, looking at the numbers coming from his wand, which he had used to cast the weighing spell, \u201cyou may play in the match.\u00a0 But eat a complete breakfast tomorrow, and be careful!\u00a0 And keep working on putting on weight afterwards- don\u2019t think I haven\u2019t seen you struggling through seconds this whole week.\u201d\u00a0 She ruffled his hair in mock exaggeration.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry smiled sheepishly at her; caught out.\u00a0 \u201cThanks Minnie!\u00a0 I\u2019ll make Gryffindor proud.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI know you will,\u201d she told him, running a thumb over his cheek.\u00a0 \u201cBut I\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t take any unnecessary risks.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe snitch will stay out of my mouth this time,\u201d he told her solemnly, before they both broke into giggles.\u00a0\n***\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The next day dawned gloomy and overcast, the sky pregnant with impending rain.\u00a0 Harry was put off by the thought of food, but he struggled through his breakfast and gulped down his potions, which seemed to taste even worse than usual.\u00a0 He and his friends made his way down to the pitch, and they split off as he and the twins headed to the changing room.\nHe tried to find a quiet corner to change, ashamed of his scars but seeing no point in putting up the glamours since Fred and George would only scold him for it, so he was grateful when the two sensed his hesitation and positioned themselves in a way that no one else would see the spot Harry picked to put on his quidditch robes.\u00a0 As soon as he was dressed and going for his broom, he was accosted by Wood, who was disgruntled that Harry hadn\u2019t been able to come to practice and was talking at him so quickly that his words about strategy and plays were barely comprehensible.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They\u2019d lined themselves up at the field and were waiting for Madame Hooch to bring the balls when Oliver turned to Harry one more time.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAlright Potter, the Ravenclaw seeker, Cho, is good, two years older, and a heck of a lot bigger than you, but you\u2019re better.\u00a0 We were so close last year; we\u2019ve simply got to win the cup this time, so get the snitch or die trying.\u201d\u00a0\nBefore Harry, or anyone else, could respond to that, Madame Hooch called for the captains to shake hands, then she\u2019d blown the whistle and they were off.\u00a0 Things seemed to be going well at first as Harry watched the game from above.\u00a0 But Gryffindor had barely scored their second goal when a bludger came rocketing at Harry\u2019s nose.\u00a0 He managed to dodge it when he realised that there was some sort of curse on it.\u00a0 Before he could register why the magic felt familiar, however, it came at him again, this time from the back.\u00a0\nFred and George looked worried, and what started as just George tailing him out of concern soon turned to both of them surrounding him as the bludger doubled its violent efforts.\u00a0\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s tampered with this bludger,\u201d Fred ground out as he whacked it away for the fourth time.\u00a0\n\u201cI know; I can feel a curse.\u00a0 I just can\u2019t seem to\u201d- Harry was cut off as the bludger came from it again.\u00a0 Two more minutes and Wood called a time out.\n\u201cFred, George- what is going on!\u00a0 Angelina nearly got hit by a bludger and now Ravenclaw is ten points up!\u201d\n\u201cWe were trying to stop the other one from hitting Harry,\u201d George grit his teeth as he responded.\u00a0\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s messed with it!\u201d Fred added.\n\u201cCan we call for an inquiry?\u201d Harry asked, thinking of Minnie\u2019s plea to be careful.\u00a0\n\u201cNot without forfeiting the match,\u201d Wood replied.\u00a0 \u201cLook, Harry, you\u2019re a good flyer.\u00a0 You can handle this.\u00a0 Fred, George, you need to back off so he can actually see to look for the snitch.\u201d\nThe twins both opened their mouths to argue, but Harry held up a hand.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s okay guys, I\u2019ll be fine.\u00a0 Besides, I couldn\u2019t play the finals last year, and we lost.\u00a0 I owe Oliver this.\u201d\u00a0\nBefore the twins could respond that Harry didn\u2019t owe Wood anything, Madame Hooch asked if they were quite finished, and Oliver, who had taken Harry\u2019s response as the end of the matter, shouted that they were.\u00a0 They were up in the air without any time for more discussion, and while Fred still trailed Harry, he was zipping around too fast both to look for the Snitch and evade the bludger that the beater, on his old Comet 260, couldn\u2019t hope to keep up.\u00a0 He only hoped someone caught the snitch soon and put an end to this madness; at this point he didn\u2019t care who won.\u00a0\nHarry finally spotted the Snitch hovering just below Cho, who had stopped to take a breather, and dove for it.\u00a0 The bludger trailed after him.\u00a0 The Ravenclaw\u2019s eyes widened for a moment as she just saw Harry rushing towards her, only to drop towards the snitch, which, along with Harry, was already far ahead of her.\nHarry\u2019s hand was two feet from the snitch\u2026one foot\u2026 eight inches, when- BAM!\u00a0 The bludger smacked him in the elbow and he saw stars as he felt the familiar sensation of bone cracking.\u00a0 But never mind that; he was so close.\u00a0 He gritted his teeth and shot forward, quickly reclaiming the ground the snitch had covered.\u00a0 He took his good arm off the broom handle and reached for the little gold ball, holding on with his legs as he managed to get a hold of it and the match ended.\u00a0 He was a foot from the ground when he rolled off his broom and into the soft mud.\u00a0\nProfessor McGonagall rushed up.\u00a0 \u201cWhat the hell was that?\u00a0 Why did no one call of the match!\u00a0 I tried to get Hooch\u2019s attention, but she told me you all had decided to continue.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cBlame Oliver,\u201d Angelina ground out bitterly.\u00a0 \u201cHe told Harry to get the snitch or die trying, and Harry of course was too sweet to disappoint.\u201d\u00a0 Nobody on the team was very happy with Oliver at the moment.\n\u201cMr. Wood!\u00a0 Detention for a MONTH!

Pomphrey had to set him on a higher dose.\u00a0 Not even the news that their whole group- he, Draco, the Weasleys, Pansy, Blaise, Seamus, Dean, and Neville- were going to be spending Christmas break at the Malfoy manor with Narcissa, Dobby, and Aralynn managed to ease the overarching wave of anxiety that seemed to settle over the castle.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hoping to ease the tension, especially out of fear for Harry\u2019s health, Minerva had owl-ordered a muggle television, and with the combined genius of Hermione, Pansy, and the Weasley twins, had managed to rig it to work with the castles magic.\u00a0 Now the entire Gryffindor common room crowded around it in the evenings to watch muggle telly programs, and for a short time, it seemed to relax the students, although after some trial and error, it was generally agreed that sitcoms were the better choice in the current situation, as the students, especially Harry and Draco, tended to jump and flinch frequently at any programme that included loud noises or excessive violence.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m telling you, Mia, you\u2019re such a Monica\u2026\u201d Pansy was telling her friend in the hallway one day.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m not saying that I\u2019m not, I\u2019m just saying that you\u2019re just as much of one.\u201d\u00a0 Hermione was waving her hands around as she argued.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell yes, but I\u2019ve got a delightful touch of Phoebe thrown in.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHey, I thought we all agreed that Luna was the Phoebe of our group.\u201d\u00a0 Ginny shouted over them.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m not claiming all of Phoebe, just like, a little bit.\u00a0 I\u2019m too gay to be completely Monica,\u201d Pansy shouted as she waved her hands around and almost smacked an unwary Draco in the face.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cQuiet down, Miss Parkinson,\u201d Snape, who was escorting them to Herbology, barked at her.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSuch a Ross,\u201d Pansy rolled her eyes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing he doesn\u2019t know what that means,\u201d Harry giggled, nudging Pansy in the side, exactly where she happened to be ticklish.\u00a0 She screeched and reached to give him a noogie, and for a moment they almost forgot why Professor Snape was escorting them in the first place.\u00a0 That is, until one of the mirrors surrounding them caught the light and glanced over a paper on the wall.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Ginny asked, as they all crowded closer.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDuelling club, open to all students, starts this Thursday at 6 pm,\u201d Blaise read.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShould we go?\u201d Draco asked, nudging Harry.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIs that even a question?\u00a0 Of course we\u2019re going- we need to learn to defend ourselves!\u201d\u00a0 No one was surprised that this came from Hermione.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCouldn\u2019t agree more, Mia dear,\u201d Pansy said, looping her arm through the Gryffindor\u2019s.\u00a0 \u201cI wonder who\u2019s going to be sponsoring it; I do hope it\u2019s Flitwick, he was a duelling champion.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPlus, he might be privy to some goblin war secrets.\u201d Hermione picked up again, brown eyes gleaming like a bronze warship.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHow did I ever get along without you, Mia dear?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cStop doing that! It\u2019s creepy; you\u2019re starting to sound like the twins,\u201d Ginny shuddered.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCome along children,\u201d Severus drawled, but Harry noticed he had just a hint of a smirk around the corners of his mouth.\u00a0 He knew something, then.\u00a0 Thursday couldn\u2019t come fast enough.\u00a0\n***\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Great Hall was, as expected, filled to the brim come Thursday evening, and the house tables had been pushed to the side.\u00a0 A platform had been erected where the teacher\u2019s table normally stood, and on it stood a grinning Gilderoy Lockhart, what little hair he had left clinging in wisps to his scalp, his teeth the colour of lemsip (the kids had been waiting for the ball to drop, but nobody seemed willing to tell Lockhart and ruin the splendid joke).\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWelcome, welcome, girls and boys, to my duelling club!\u201d\u00a0 he exalted, opening his arms as if he were welcoming an adoring crowd, who, in place of being adoring, seemed to be stuck between whether to groan or snort derisively.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh no,\u201d Ron groaned, gripping Neville\u2019s shoulder.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWait, guys, look,\u201d Harry pointed to Snape, who was leaning against the wall in a shadowy corner, smirking faintly.\u00a0 \u201cThis might get interesting.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And indeed, it did, as the blonde ponce continued talking (wow, there\u2019s an unusual sentence, Harry thought idly).\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI have with me today Professor Snape, who has a little duelling experience himself and has agreed to be my assistant.\u201d\u00a0 Snape, instead of looking bitter, merely smirked harder.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The entire school waited with baited breath.\u00a0 Snape had been much less of an arse this year, and although nobody outside of Harry\u2019s group really understood why, the fact was that Severus\u2019 somewhat improved demeanour, when set alongside Lockhart\u2019s incompetence and arrogance, made him a clear fan-favourite that evening.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lockhart and Snape stood at opposite ends of the platform, and when Lockhart announced that they would bow and begin, Snape responded to his gratuitous flourish with a jerky little nod.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Gilderoy shouted something incomprehensible and wiggled his wand, and a weak spell shot towards Snape.\u00a0 Harry, who\u2019d removed the magical suppression on his lenses to better enjoy the show, leaned over to whisper to Draco that it looked like a pixie fart, and the blond was trying so hard not to laugh that he almost missed Severus lackadaisical sidestep and shout of Expelliarmus!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Gilderoy was knocked bodily off the platform, and the assembled students cheered.\u00a0 Lockhart, trying desperately to conserve his dignity, began to mumble something about \u201cLet him win,\u201d and \u201ccould have easily blocked it\u201d before Severus\u2019 venomous glare shut him up.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cVery well, do quiet down,\u201d the potions master drawled, although not sounding at all like he meant it.\u00a0 \u201cI am going to pair you up to do a practice.\u00a0 Harry, Draco\u201d the two boys, who had been giggling over some private joke, both looked up at the sound of their names.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou two would be an excellent pair for a demonstration, if you\u2019re amenable,\u201d the teacher said, and Harry was struck by how much he had changed, that he was even framing it as an option instead of a demand.\u00a0 He looked at Draco.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou ready to lose, blondie?\u201d\u00a0 He quirked his left eyebrow, and his scar, which ended just after cutting through the outside of that eyebrow, wrinkled mesmerizingly.\u00a0 Draco, who had been distracted watching it, almost missed the question before he shook himself back to reality.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m ready to look good while winning, you giant twat.\u201d\u00a0 He lowered his voice.\u00a0 \u201cBut no mage senses; that\u2019s cheating.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI think a Slytherin would call it playing to your advantages.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSucks that you\u2019re a Gryffindor, then.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIf you\u2019re quite done flirting,\u201d Snape\u2019s voice cut across the hall.\u00a0 \u201cWe don\u2019t have all night.\u201d\u00a0 Both boys blushed brilliantly, although Draco\u2019s was far more visible under his fair skin.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They stepped onto the platform.\u00a0 \u201cScared, Potter?\u201d Draco asked, trying to save face.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou wish,\u201d Harry responded as they bowed to each other.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As they began the duel, Draco got the sense that Harry was going easy on him.\u00a0 In another world, he would have responded to that by using a Serpentsortia, but besides knowing that summoning a snake would probably help Harry more than him, he didn\u2019t want the whole castle knowing that Harry was a parselmouth.\u00a0 Besides the fact that it would surely foster distrust, Draco liked the idea that it was something that very few people knew about.\u00a0 It made him feel warm inside, like Harry had acknowledged him as special over everyone who didn\u2019t know.\u00a0 He shook his head again and shot a Rictumsempra, which Harry blocked with a Protego at the last second.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t go easy on me, you arse,\u201d he taunted his friend.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m a big boy, I can take it!\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAlright then,\u201d the Gryffindor laughed, emerald eyes alight.\u00a0 \u201cJust remember that you asked for it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Draco suddenly found himself flat on his back, but his back was flat against not the floor, but a small muggle trampoline that bounced him up and down, up and down, automatically.\u00a0 He tried to shoot a spell Harry\u2019s way, but it missed by a mile before his friend blessedly disarmed him.\u00a0 When he once again found himself blessedly upright, he caught his reflection in one of the mirrors surrounding the students and gasped: his pale blonde hair and eyebrows were now a vibrant shade of red and gold.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, you complete and utter prat!\u201d he shrieked, running towards his friend.\u00a0 Harry was laughing so hard that, even though he saw Draco coming, he could do nothing to respond.\u00a0 Draco, who had the advantage of height, had trapped him in a bear hug and was giving him a very long noogie.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cChange it back you twat; change it back!\u201d he screamed, although he hurt his own cause when his hysterical screeching only set Harry laughing again.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOkay, okay, I\u2019ll fix it!\u201d his friend gasped once he could breath again.\u00a0 \u201cJust loosen up so I can move my wand arm.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo- I know you can do it without, and I\u2019m not letting you go anywhere until my hair is its usual perfection, something you wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d\u00a0 Harry, whose hair was, if possible, even more mussed than usual, had to concede he had a point as he silently cast a counter-charm.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBoys, boys, as amusing as that is, I would like to have another demonstration.\u00a0 Granger, Parkinson, would you like to come up and do a practice before we turn you all loose to practice on your own?\u201d\u00a0 Snape ushered a still-laughing Draco and Harry off the stage and Pansy and Hermione walked gracefully up to take their place.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pansy and Hermione were clearly more evenly-matched, skill wise, than the two boys, but they also weren\u2019t normal second years.\u00a0 They spent a lot of time doing independent studying, and it showed.\u00a0 As close as they were, there was no holding back, and spell-fire was flying so quickly, to Harry, the stage was like a firework show.\u00a0 Harry was glad Dumbledore wasn\u2019t in the hall, as he knew the headmaster would not approve of some of the spells the two second-years were learning.\u00a0 It\u2019s a good thing the group themselves knew that it wasn\u2019t the spells they used, but how they used them that made the real difference.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was twenty minutes later when Severus, who had taking over as the unofficial club leader, called a stalemate.\u00a0 The two girls were sweating and panting, but as for actual damage, Hermione sported only a slightly singed curl in her bushy hair, and Pansy\u2019s robe dragged a ripped hemline like a tail when she walked off the stage.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMerlin\u2019s saggy balls, Pans, \u2018Mione, I don\u2019t think most seventh years fight like that!\u201d\u00a0 George whistled.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell then, they should get on our level,\u201d Pansy tossed her hair over her shoulder and put her arm around Hermione.\u00a0 \u201cWe aren\u2019t gonna be sitting ducks the next time something in this school tries to kill us.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHow many times has something actually tried to kill you?\u201d\u00a0 Blaise rolled his eyes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, none for me, and only once for Hermione,\u201d Pansy admitted.\u00a0 \u201cBut now that we\u2019re all friends with Harry, The Boy with the Worst Luck, \u201cI think that number\u2019s about to go up.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThanks for the vote of confidence, Pans,\u201d Harry remarked, looking up from where he\u2019d been tracing patterns in the air with his wand.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHarry darling, you know we love you, so why don\u2019t you just be content that we\u2019ll either die together or not at all?\u201d\u00a0 Pansy sarcastically waved her fingers at him.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCheerful,\u201d Seamus snorted.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShut up and pair up!\u201d Snape shouted from the front of the room, and for the remainder of the hour, there was very little talk and a lot of flying wands.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Two days after the duel, Draco, Harry, Pansy, and Hermione were enjoying some quiet time in Harry\u2019s room.\u00a0 The others had all laughed at Hermione\u2019s offer of homework and study schedules, but now they were busy catching up on everything they\u2019d procrastinated while the Hermione and the three of them, who\u2019d thought it was a good idea to take Hermione\u2019s advice, basked in the sunlit warmth of Harry\u2019s bedroom.\u00a0 Draco had his nose buried in a Spiderman comic while Pansy and Hermione devoured some new muggle vampire series the Granger had sent their daughter.\u00a0 Harry, who had been rereading his favourite Spiderman comic until the blonde who currently sat engrossed in it had snatched it away, lie on the carpeted floor with Du lounged on his chest, translating a Wonder Woman graphic novel into parseltongue for the adder.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou know who we haven\u2019t seen in a while?\u201d the question came from Draco, who had just finished his comic and was now tickling Hermione\u2019s bare feet with an eagle-feather quill?\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWho?\u201d the muggleborn asked as Draco dodged the kick she sent his way.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMyrtle.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been visiting her less than usual since we can\u2019t go anywhere without a teacher.\u00a0 We should ask Minnie if she\u2019d mind taking us down there.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s a good idea,\u201d Pansy agreed, setting down her own book.\u00a0 \u201cBesides, all the protagonist has been talking about for the past ten pages is this stupid boy.\u00a0 Personally, I don\u2019t see why she doesn\u2019t just drink him and spare herself the trouble.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThis!\u00a0 This is why most of our year is terrified of you!\u201d Harry emphasized, going back to an argument they\u2019d been having the day before.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWimps.\u00a0 It\u2019s not as if I go around drinking boys.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou would if you had half a chance,\u201d Hermione, hummed, setting down her own novel.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPoint taken,\u201d Pansy agreed stoically.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Draco, who, hands on his neck, had gone to get McGonagall during this conversation, returned with the professor.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIf you\u2019re all quite done with your plans to drink away the patriarchy, perhaps you\u2019d like to see Myrtle,\u201d Minnie said primly, but couldn\u2019t stop the twinkle in her eyes.\u00a0 As she led the foursome down to the first-floor bathroom, Pansy continued outlining how she would be the best vampire overlord.\u00a0 (\u201cI\u2019d be like, the anti-Buffy, Mia.\u00a0 Wouldn\u2019t that be awesome?!\u201d)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHey Myrt, sorry it\u2019s been so long,\u201d Harry said cheerfully as he almost bounced into the bathroom, eager to see a female friend that wasn\u2019t discussing a new world order.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHi Harry,\u201d the ghost greeted distractedly, floating outside her usual stall and looking mildly puzzled.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhatcha doin\u2019?\u201d the Gryffindor asked.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s very strange.\u00a0 I was just sitting in my toilet, having a nice nap after having Peeves do my bidding all morning, when somebody chucked a book through my head?\u00a0 As best as I can figure, it\u2019s just a normal blank book, so why would somebody try to throw it in a toilet?\u201d\u00a0 She rubbed her incorporeal chin as she stared at a black, leather-bound notebook in a puddle of toilet water on the floor.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat is weird,\u201d Draco agreed, going to pick it up, but Harry, who had extended his mage senses to poke at it, practically knocked him over as he reached for it.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDON\u2019T TOUCH THAT!\u201d Draco jumped; the only time he\u2019d ever heard Harry yell that loudly was when Rita Skeeter had insulted his mum in that Prophet article.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s gross; it\u2019s black as hell.\u00a0 It\u2019s practically slimy.\u201d\u00a0 McGonagall grew even more concerned than she had been when Harry yelled; her boy almost never cussed, certainly less than she\u2019d been doing lately, so it must be bad.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy would a notebook be a dark artefact?\u201d Pansy wondered aloud.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I think it drains magic.\u00a0 It\u2019s got this other signature in it, and it feels like a kid\u2019s.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Draco blanched and scrambled further back, dragging Harry with him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe have to take this to Dumbledore,\u201d Minerva sighed.\u00a0 \u201cAs much as I loathe to admit it, he may know more about this type of thing than I do.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHow are we going to get it there?\u00a0 I don\u2019t want any of us touching it or levitating it until we know exactly how it works,\u201d Harry warned, and since he was the only one who could sense its magic in any way, the others nodded their head in agreement.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI have an idea!\u201d Myrtle actually brightened as she put her fingers in her mouth and let out a piercing whistle.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou called, my lady?\u201d A tired looking Peeves called a moment later.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh, hello Peeves.\u00a0 Pick that up and carry it to Dumbledore\u2019s office with us.\u201d\u00a0 Peeves did as instructed, and Myrtle floated behind, keeping a close eye on Peeves to make sure he was cooperating and that the diary didn\u2019t seem to be possessing him instantly.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Minnie said the password (Bertie Botts) and they all mounted the moving staircase.\u00a0 Dumbledore looked mildly surprised at being disturbed, but he stopped instantly when he saw the diary, which had flipped open as Peeves set it on his desk.\u00a0 The name Tom M. Riddle stood out like blood on white sheets.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThis\u2026 where did you find this?\u201d the headmaster asked, almost in a whisper, and Myrtle explained what had happened.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd you think this diary has been possessing a student?\u201d he turned to Harry when the ghost had finished her story.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes.\u00a0 And,\u201d he took a deep breath.\u00a0 \u201cIt obviously has something to do with the chamber.\u00a0 The signature on the diary is similar to the residual black magic around the chamber, and there\u2019s someone else\u2019s magic being held captive in there.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDo you know whose magic is trapped inside?\u201d the headmaster asked Harry.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0 Harry sighed.\u00a0 \u201cIt feels slightly familiar, but if I knew exactly whose it was, I would have said that.\u201d\u00a0 Despite the situation, Minerva smiled a bit.\u00a0 She really appreciated Harry\u2019s sass.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, in that case, I suppose we must handle the situation otherwise.\u201d\u00a0 Dumbledore cast a sonorous charm and made a general announcement for the student who lost their diary to please come to his office, and that the Gargoyle would open for them.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When a tired Susan Bones trekked up the stairs ten minutes Later, Harry bit his lip so he wouldn\u2019t gasp.\u00a0 It was Susan!\u00a0 He distantly remembered when he had the flu a few weeks back, when she was in for a pepper-up and her magic had felt faded.\u00a0 Enough time with McGonagall had taught Harry to know that a situation like this wasn\u2019t his fault; he couldn\u2019t be expected to remember that when he had a fever so high he was only dimly aware of where he was.\u00a0 No, what surprised him was how faded Susan\u2019s magic was now.\u00a0 Whatever the diary had been doing to her, it had obviously only gotten worse.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSusan, dear, this is yours?\u201d Dumbledore asked, motioning to the diary.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2026it was\u2026 but I don\u2019t want it anymore.\u201d\u00a0 Her lip quivered and the dark circles under her eyes stood out in stark relief against her skin, which was far paler than her normal skin tone.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI see.\u00a0 Would you mind telling us why?\u201d\u00a0 Dumbledore asked, and McGonagall thought that all this circumnavigating around the topic was rather cruel to the girl, but before she could say so, Susan broke down in tears.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2026 I di- hic, I didn\u2019t mean to!\u201d\u00a0 She sobbed.\u00a0 \u201cI found the diary in Diagon alley, and when it wrote back, I\u2026 I thought it was just an interesting little novelty\u2026 I didn\u2019t know it would do that!\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDo what?\u201d Dumbledore prodded, and Minerva shot him a glare.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2026 I think I ope- I opened the\u2026 the chamber!\u201d She wailed.\u00a0 \u201cI started feeling really tired all the time, and I wasn\u2019t too worried, but then\u2026 then I started losing my memory.\u00a0 And I woke up covered in rooster feathers.\u00a0 And then the red paint- and the whole time I was talking to Tom, and I, I didn\u2019t think that\u2026 that he could be doing it!\u00a0 I thought there was something wrong with me, but I was afraid.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t want them to lock me up, but I swear I didn\u2019t mean to.\u00a0 Tom didn\u2019t want me to throw him away, but I forced myself.\u00a0 Please don\u2019t send me to Azkaban!\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Before Dumbledore can respond again, Harry slowly and gently wrapped an arm around Susan and started rubbing her shoulders.\u00a0 \u201cNo one\u2019s gonna send you to Azkaban, Susan.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t your fault- whatever this is, it\u2019s super dark.\u00a0 A grown wizard couldn\u2019t have resisted that kind of power.\u00a0 Nobody\u2019s gonna punish you; nobody is even gonna know you were the one possessed,\u201d Harry soothed.\u00a0 \u201cRight, Headmaster?\u201d Harry looked at Dumbledore, and there was a note of steel in his kind eyes.\u00a0 Even if Dumbledore hadn\u2019t felt like he owed the child something, the power and conviction in his small face would have convinced him to go along with his ideas.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOf course not, Susan.\u00a0 No lasting harm has been done, we\u2019ll just lock the diary away and reseal the chamber.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo lasting harm!\u00a0 Albus, an innocent student has been possessed by a dark artefact and traumatised in her place of learning- we cannot go on as before!\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, what do you propose that we do?\u201d Dumbledore asked, rubbing his forehead tiredly.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSend Miss Bones to the hospital wing to be taken care of and tell Severus to prepare to gather potions ingredients from a very large corpse.\u00a0 As for me, I will need to borrow Fawkes and the Sword of Gryffindor.\u201d\u00a0 Professor McGonagall clenched her hands.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m going to blow up a monster,\u201d Minnie said, covering Harry\u2019s ears with her hands.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve had it with this motherfucking basilisk in this motherfucking chamber!\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hey babes: so lthis isn't a chapter, but I hope to get another one or two up today.\u00a0 This is, rather, a quick little note on Harry's\u00a0mage senses and to adress some of the plot holes that could potentially come up from this idea.\u00a0 Harry sensing magic is one of my favourite headcanons, but it's definitely kinda difficult to work properly- hence why I didn't make Harry a horcrux.\u00a0 But Harry, although unusually magically powerful in this story, is not invincible or all-powerful.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For example: Scabbers.\u00a0 While Harry would normally have the ability to detect a witch or wizard in their animagus form from a normal, non-magical animal, magic is more or less visible depending on how often it is used (in my opinion).\u00a0 So Scabbers, who has been in his animagus form constantly for the last eleven years and is also surrounded by the magic of the burrow and also carries residual magic from all the Weasley kids practicing spells on him.\u00a0 And since Harry can't remember meeting human Peter and his magical signature is so weak because he hasn't used his magic since the night Voldemort killed the Potters, Harry just doesn't pick up on it.\u00a0 Also, Harry is surrounded by a lot of magic, all the time, when he's at Hogwarts, so he doesn't really pay a tonne of attention to any one thing- he actually spends a lot of time trying to block out most of the surrounding input.\u00a0 So he doesn't notice everything.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Next is Snape's dark mark.\u00a0 I don't know if you guys spend as much time thinking about all the potential plot holes as I do, but Harry\u00a0can\u00a0feel the dark mark on Snape; however, he doesn't really know what a dark mark\u00a0is\u00a0yet, and a little bit of dark magic in Severus' overall magical signature wouldn't be all that surprising to Harry, because, well, he's Snape, and everyone has a mix of different feelings of magic.\u00a0 It's not necessarily the classification of magic that affects it, but how it is used.\u00a0 So\u00a0dark\u00a0magic isn't necessarily bad, although Harry can feel when it's been used to kill people and such, hence why the\u00a0black magic surrounding the chamber feels so abhorrent to him.\u00a0 Although Snape has the dark mark, the fact that he doesn't really fall into the category of 'devoted death eaters' means his own magical signature would temper that input a little bit (and I'm not defending canon-Snape's actions here; I'm just saying that however much he sucked, he wasn't as abhorrent as the devoted, really-believed-in-Voldemort's-cause death eaters).\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Also, Harry doesn't recognise Tom Riddle's magic as Voldemort's magic (although it feels relatively familiar) or Quirrell's turban magic as Voldemort's magic because Voldemort's magic has changed forms a lot.\u00a0 Voldemort fucked up his soul so much that the residual magic in the chamber, the magic in the diary, the magic in Snape's dark mark, and the magic in Quirrell's turban all felt somewhat different.\u00a0 As I mentioned in the first chapter, Harry thought the darkness in Quirrell's turban was his fear of everything; he was new to the wizarding world and it didn't make a lot of sense yet.\u00a0 Also, Voldemort was sharing Quirell's own magic and his turban, not-corporeal form is different than body-of-his-own Voldemort's magic; mainly in that it's weaker.\u00a0 In the same vein, another death deater who is more devoted to Voldemort, like Bellatrix, and thus would have welcomed the dark mark further into her and made it more a part of her own identity would have a mark that feels closer to Voldemort's own magic.\u00a0 Lucius would be somewhere in between, because while he believes in the blood-purity bullshit, his main loyalty is to himself, and besides, Harry didn't really have that much time to focus on Lucius at all when he was surrounded by the black magic of Borgun and Birke's and then running for his life.\u00a0 Anyway, I've spent a lot of time doing a world-building sort of exercise so I can include this but not have it make Harry some sort of invincible wizard or have this create a bunch of plot holes.\u00a0 I'm gonna get back to working on my next chapters now, so just read this please, because I think it's important.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cUh, Minerva\u2026\u201d Albus began carefully in response to this bold proclamation.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, do shut up Albus,\u201d she snapped at him.\u00a0 Then she turned to the kids.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAlright team, this is how it\u2019s going to work\u2026\u201d despite the situation, Pansy was nearly bouncing on the balls of her feet- this was like a muggle spy movie!\u00a0 \u201cPansy, you\u2019re going to go get the rest of your group with Draco.\u00a0 Even though I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s actually going down into the chamber, Harry\u2019s the only one who speaks Parseltongue, and there\u2019s safety in numbers.\u201d\u00a0 Pansy nodded and headed off.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHarry, you and Hermione take Susan to the hospital wing.\u201d\u00a0 Hermione nodded, but Harry looked at his guardian.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cUh, Minnie\u2026 if I go anywhere near the hospital wing, Madame Pomphrey is gonna try to keep me there for one reason or another.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 She nodded at her child.\u00a0 \u201cGood point\u2026 Hermione, catch up to Pansy and Draco.\u00a0 When you\u2019ve gotten the others, bring Neville and Luna with you back here to aid Susan.\u00a0 Leave Neville with her as moral support and bring Luna to Myrtle\u2019s bathroom.\u201d\u00a0 Hermione nodded briskly, sprinting down the stairs.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOkay Harry,\u201d she knelt down to look her boy in the eyes.\u00a0 \u201cYour part is very important, but I also need you to stay safe.\u00a0 You are going to open the chamber, I am going to descend.\u00a0 Then you are going to call the basilisk; as a parselmouth, you should have some measure of control.\u00a0 I am going to have Fawkes peck out the eyes and then I am going to stab it until it dies.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSounds simple enough.\u00a0 But shouldn\u2019t we do something about the diary first?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh yes, smart boy.\u00a0 What would I do without you?\u201d\u00a0 Harry blushed at the compliment as Minerva grabbed the sorting hat off a stool in the corner and stuck her arm in it, fishing around a moment before she pulled out a great, ruby-encrusted sword.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAlbus, step back from the desk and send your Patronus to Severus to ask him to meet us up here.\u201d\u00a0 The headmaster, accepting that he was no longer the one in charge of the situation, merely nodded and did as instructed.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Minerva picked up the heavy sword with as much ease as she picked up her wand- it wasn\u2019t for nothing she was named after the Roman goddess of wisdom and battle.\u00a0 She closed one eye and lined up the blade before plunging it downwards into the diary, and the book let out a terrible scream and a putrid cloud of fetid blackness, visible not only to Harry but to the others in the room, exited the pages with a scream.\u00a0 Harry gripped Susan\u2019s hand reassuringly as she blanched.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, that\u2019s one obstacle out of the way,\u201d she said, her voice far calmer and steadier than the situation called for.\u00a0 Pansy and Hermione came rushing into the room with the others a moment later, and Severus Snape (who had not run but merely walked briskly; he wasn\u2019t at Albus\u2019 beck and call, thank you very much) followed shortly after.\u00a0 Minerva quickly explained the plan to them, and they were all serious faces and ready for action.\u00a0 Hermione, Neville, and Luna patted Susan on the arm and led her gently out, and the rest of them (minus Dumbledore, Minerva made it quite clear he was not welcome) headed to Myrtle\u2019s bathroom.\u00a0 Peeves had been dismissed as soon as he\u2019d deposited the diary, but the ghost had stayed quietly in the corner of the room.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m going down with you professor,\u201d her tone was confident and steady, with no trace of the sobbing ghost of earlier years.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m already dead; the worst that could happen is petrification, and it would be good for you to have an extra line of defence.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou make an excellent point, Myrtle, and if this is truly your wish, I cannot stop you.\u00a0 I will merely remind you that, should you get petrified, it will be until nearly June before the mandrakes are ready to restore you,\u201d Minerva told her seriously, not with the tone of a teacher to a student, but of one talking to another, equally qualified professional.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve been dead for fifty years and I\u2019ll be here for thousands more.\u00a0 What\u2019s a few months?\u201d she shrugged, and Minerva nodded in approval.\u00a0 They were ready.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Minnie led the way, holding Harry\u2019s hand to make sure that he was safely ensconced beside her.\u00a0 Although he knew he was probably to old for it, Harry didn\u2019t argue- he rather enjoyed it, to be honest, and it wasn\u2019t completely ridiculous, considering the situation.\u00a0 His friends didn\u2019t say a word about it either, wonderful people that they were.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They got to the bathroom, and Harry hissed the chamber open.\u00a0 Fred and George stepped forward, each putting a hand on his shoulder.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAlright professor,\u201d Fred said.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re going to put a sonorous spell on Harry; after he calls the basilisk, he can feel for it and tell you if you\u2019re in danger of looking into his eyes.\u00a0 After Fawkes, who Harry will also be feeling for, has blinded it and thus rendered it safe to look at, Fred and I are going to cast a videotaping spell, because let\u2019s be honest, this is going to be bloody brilliant and it must be documented for posterity.\u00a0 Once you\u2019ve gone all boss on it and killed it, Professor Snape can come down to start harvesting the corpse.\u00a0 Also, I think it\u2019s fair to say that anyone who wants to take a peek around should be allowed down once it\u2019s dead- this is a thousand-year-old hidden chamber, and it\u2019d be fun to check it out,\u201d George picked up, and both teachers present had to agree that this would be an excellent educational opportunity, and after the basilisk was dead there would be no reason to stay away.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cVery well; I approve these requests,\u201d Minerva said, and Severus gave a brisk nod as his colleague slid into the unknown.\u00a0 There was a tense few moments of waiting before the professor\u2019s magically magnified voice called out a terse \u201cready.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOkay, I\u2019m calling it!\u201d Harry yelled, before switching to parseltongue.\u00a0 He wasn\u2019t sure exactly what to say, and he wasn\u2019t exactly the most articulate on the spot, so he eventually just went with \u201ccome on, big snake.\u00a0 Just uh, find the pretty bird!\u201d\u00a0 He was glad none of his friends spoke the language, they\u2019d never let him live it down.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pushing his not-so-epic battle cry out of his mind, Harry set himself on the floor, Fred and George moving in front of him, and tuned in to feel around for the basilisk.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t hard, he just looked for the really fucking big, snake-shaped magical signature and followed it.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIncoming!\u201d he shouted down.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s about to be outgoing!\u201d Minerva yelled back up, and Harry stifled a tension-giggle.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As soon as the basilisk entered the central rotunda, Harry expanded his senses to include Fawkes, who was dodging the angry serpent as it thrashed about, trying to reach him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSsssstoppp it, sssssstupid fire-chicken,\u201d the basilisk yelled, followed by a scream of agony as Fawkes managed to peck out the fatal magical orb in its right eye socket.\u00a0 It flapped upwards for just a moment, diving back down with the precision of a hawk when the snake\u2019s angry thrashing exposed its other eye for the phoenix\u2019s waiting claws.\u00a0 The red bird seemed to take special pleasure in pecking this eye out with a lot more vehemence than was strictly needed.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cEyes down, eyes down!\u201d Harry yelled, and this time he watched his guardian\u2019s signature, anxiously, specifically, as Minerva danced around the chamber, dodging the basilisk\u2019s fangs as it lunged randomly in a blind rage.\u00a0 With far more agility than one would expect from a prim, seemingly straight-laced middle aged academic, everyone watched through the newly-cast video spell as the tabby animagus leapt onto the base of a statue of Salazar Slytherin.\u00a0\nAn overpowered levitation spell and another leap had her perching elegantly on top of Salazar\u2019s hands, and strands of grey-streaked ebony hair loosed themselves from her bun and whipped around her face with a vengeance as she took a great, bounding jump and landed atop the basilisk\u2019s back.\u00a0 It thrashed again, but she adjusted herself with an agility that bespoke her feline side as she plunged the great red sword directly in between two bones in the spine.\u00a0 The snake gave a great shudder that shook the chamber, and the students gasped as one as even Myrtle\u2019s bathroom gave a small shudder.\u00a0 The professor herself merely dismounted the corpse, cast a charm to rid her robes of the scarlet blood, and pulled her hair back into its proper bindings.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou may come down now!\u201d She shouted up to them.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s perfectly harmless at the moment.\u201d\u00a0 The kids wolf-whistled and cheered as they lined up to slide down.\u00a0 Their professor was a goddamn boss!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Harry, who\u2019d never had the pleasure of going to any amusement parks with the Dursleys, very much enjoyed the ride down through the twisty slide.\u00a0 \u201cWoo!\u201d he laughed as he tumbled to the bottom and landed against Ron.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOy mate!\u201d the redhead laughed, picking Harry up off the floor as Draco came tumbling down.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere\u2019s dust all over my new robes!\u201d the blonde complained, brushing himself off.\u00a0 Harry sneezed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNow there\u2019s dust in my nose!\u201d he coughed.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIs your nose made from 100% silk?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re such a prat!\u201d Harry hit him on the arm as Draco jumped back.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Before the boys could get too involved in their wrestling match, a very disgruntled Severus Snape came rocketing down the slide, a large messenger bag in his lap and a scowl on his face.\u00a0 The Weasley twins looked unbelievably delighted.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOne word from you two and you\u2019ll be looking at the insides of the cauldrons you\u2019ll be scrubbing until you leave school.\u201d\u00a0 Then he caught sight of the basilisk corpse, and all irritation left his face and he looked like he might actually cry of joy.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSo many ingredients- so rare!\u201d he whispered, walking forward as if in a haze.\u00a0 He crouched down and gently stroked one of the large fangs in the basilisk\u2019s open mouth.\u00a0 \u201cI can do so much with these\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHas he gone mad?\u201d Neville nudged Seamus as they watched Snape reverently run a finger over the scales by the basilisk\u2019s ruined eyes.\u00a0\n\u201cOh, you poor, non-Slytherin, out-of-the-loop little darlings.\u00a0 Snape has never been normal.\u201d Pansy laughed, patting Neville\u2019s shoulder.\u00a0\n\u201cGuys, guys!\u00a0 Look over here!\u201d Harry, who had broken away from the main group and started running his hands along the walls, pointed to another snake symbol.\u00a0 \u201cI think there\u2019s a secret door.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s such a mystery novel clich\u00e9,\u201d Pansy groaned, but looked excited nonetheless as Harry hissed something and the wall slid open.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s a secret library!\u201d Dean gasped.\u00a0\n\u201cAnother clich\u00e9,\u201d Pansy muttered.\u00a0 Then, pulling Seamus back, \u201cWoah there sparky.\u00a0 You\u2019ll probably burn the amazing historical clich\u00e9.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cSome of these books are in parseltongue.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t even know there was a written language\u2026\u201d Harry said reverently, pulling out a book and wiping the dust on Draco\u2019s robes.\u00a0 The other made a face in protest, but Harry merely put a finger to his mouth before he could say anything.\u00a0 \u201cThey\u2019re already dirty, you twat.\u00a0 Look at this!\u201d He pulled out another book and smiled.\u00a0\n\u201cMerlin\u2019s balls!\u201d Draco yelled, his expletive ricocheting around the room.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Salazar\u2019s personal journal!\u00a0 It\u2019s got his homemade spells and everything!\u201d\u00a0\nHermione practically ran over and leaned over Draco\u2019s shoulder as he thumbed, enraptured, through it.\u00a0 \u201cLook at this!\u00a0 Do you know how much wizard historians would give to be right here?\u201d\u00a0\nPansy called out to her from another shelf.\u00a0 \u201cMia, there\u2019s multiple volumes!\u201d\u00a0\nTheir noise had drawn Severus and Minerva to them.\u00a0 \u201cDear gods of old, have I finally died and ascended to a better plane of existence?\u00a0 Look at this place?\u201d\u00a0 Snape\u2019s eyes were the size of large black saucers.\u00a0\n\u201cWhile I cannot possibly let that comment by without pointing out how unbelievably dramatic you are, I must agree that this is an absolute wonder,\u201d Minerva responded.\u00a0\n\u201cProfessor Snape- look over here! There\u2019s a parseltongue potions journal,\u201d Harry called, and Snape, with effort, kept himself from sprinting over.\u00a0\n\u201cHow much do I have to offer you to translate this?\u201d the potions professor asked him?\n\u201cFree quiz grade?\u201d Harry shrugged.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u201cDone.\u201d Snape agreed without hesitation.\u00a0\n\u201cWow.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t think that would actually work.\u201d\u00a0 Harry\u2019s mouth was hanging open.\u00a0\n\u201cHarry, this is Salazar Snape\u2019s personal library.\u00a0 You could melt every single classroom cauldron I own and I wouldn\u2019t care.\u201d\u00a0 Snape didn\u2019t even seem to be aware of what he was saying, he was so lost in reading book titles.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t recommend trying that, though,\u201d Pansy told him.\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, he\u2019ll be back to normal when he comes down,\u201d Draco added.\n\u201cWhenever that is.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNot for a while, I\u2019d reckon.\u00a0 I\u2019ve never seen him without a scowl or a smirk.\u201d\u00a0 George, who had slinked into the room with Fred while everyone was distracted watching Severus Snape lose his damn mind over the Chamber of Secrets, had put another discreet filming spell on the scene.\n\u201cShhh,\u201d he whispered to Harry, \u201cI want a free quiz grade too.\u201d\n\u201cGood luck,\u201d his surrogate brother snorted.\u00a0 \u201cBlackmailing a Slytherin, that\u2019ll end well for you.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNever thought I\u2019d be spending Saturday night in the library,\u201d Ron muttered, but he was looking interestedly at a moving jade statue of a drakon.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between a dragon and a drakon?\u201d Dean asked as he read the inscription.\u00a0\n\u201cA dragon is bigger and stockier,\u201d Pansy told them.\u00a0 \u201cA drakon is like an overlarge lizard with wings.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cDo dragons speak Parseltongue?\u201d Harry asked.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, chosen one, considering I\u2019ve never asked one.\u201d\n\u201cYou know Pans, sometimes you are unnecessarily sarcastic.\u201d\n\u201cYou can be unnecessarily sarcastic?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cAccording to my calculations,\u201d Hermione looked up from where she was reading a large old tome.\u00a0 \u201cYou cannot.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cMia has spoken, and she\u2019s smarter than all you bitches!\u201d Pansy made a peace sign.\u00a0\n\u201cWhy did we let her watch F.r.i.e.n.d.s. again?\u201d Harry turned to Seamus.\u00a0\n\u201cBecause there were only two of us that knew muggle entertainment well enough to voice an opposition?\u201d the Irish boy guessed.\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, Hermione wasn\u2019t about to argue when she and Pansy are practically joined at the hip,\u201d Dean added, resting his elbow on Seamus\u2019 shoulder.\u00a0\n***\nThe Hogwarts dinner bell was apparently a powerful force, because it could be heard all the way down in the Chamber.\u00a0\n\u201cDo we have to go?\u201d Hermione and Pansy asked, as one.\u00a0\n\u201cYes, you all need to eat,\u201d Minerva said, looking at Harry specifically.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd some of you still have homework.\u201d Hermione reminded them not-so-gently, as she, Pansy, Draco, and Harry, the \u2018no homework left\u2019 crew, made plans to come back after dinner and explore the chamber some more.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Riding up in a giant human chain hanging by Fawkes tail was kind of awkward, so Harry, before sealing the chamber again, hissed \u201cstairs\u201d as an experiment before leaving, and the slide folded up over itself into a set of heavy stone steps.\u00a0 Snape, in a true testament to his good mood, didn\u2019t even grumble about how they should have tried that in the first place, although Draco, apparently not forgetting about his \u2018ruined\u2019 robes, certainly did.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHave a Snickers, you\u2019re not you when you\u2019re hungry,\u201d Harry quoted an American commercial at him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThen who the hell is Weasel?\u201d Draco asked, and he and Harry both broke down giggling, while Ron mumbled that he \u2018must have been bloody mad when he made friends with Draco,\u201d although anyone who knew him could tell he didn\u2019t really mean it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSomeone\u2019s mad he didn\u2019t do his homework earlier!\u201d Pansy sing-songed, and Ron just transferred his mumbling to general complaints about Slytherins.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They got to the Great Hall, and the heavenly smell of curry wafted over them.\u00a0 Harry was inhaling deeply, a smile on his face.\u00a0 He loved Indian food.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHungry?\u201d Draco teased.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cStarving.\u201d Harry smiled at him as the unlikely group all wandered into the hall together.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In the weeks that followed, Harry and his friends had taken to hanging out in the chamber, specifically the library.\u00a0 Once Susan recovered from her experience in the chamber, she and Hannah Abbott started spending time with them as well, and as genial and fun as they were, they were easily assimilated into their group.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hermione, Draco, and Pansy were trying to find ways to better the standards of living for house elves.\u00a0 Hermione had been uncomfortable with the idea that they were basically bonded slaves, but a trip to the kitchens had opened her eyes to the fact that they seemed to like the current state of affairs. However, they all agreed that something needed to be done, and Draco felt very keenly for Dobby\u2019s former state of misery. So they had started The Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare (the three founders called it the society, and the rest of the group jokingly called it SPEW behind their backs) with the goal of puzzling out a way to ensure that house elves were well-treated and had at least the option of autonomy, should they desire it, without coming across as threatening to the elves who felt it an offense to be freed.\nHarry had offered to help with SPEW, but the other three claimed to have it well under control, and Harry didn\u2019t understand the subtleties of house-elf culture, being muggle-raised, so they had told him they might recruit his assistance once they had a plan of action.\u00a0 Thus, as November faded into December, those three worked on SPEW and the rest of his friends spent their time in a quiet nook of the chamber library, cramming for exams because they\u2019d laughed at Hermione\u2019s study schedule and thus had no free time like the other four, while Harry sat surrounded by Salazar Slytherin\u2019s parseltongue manuscripts on various subjects.\u00a0 He spent hours, quill in hand scribbling away as he translated and memorized everything from previously unknown potions formulas to alternate, meditation-based pathways of achieving an animagus transfiguration.\u00a0 He even found a spell that allowed for the temporary creation of mental walls that worked even for those without knowledge or skill in Occlumency, and he practiced this until he could do it both wandlessly and silently, figuring it could come in extremely useful.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Another thing he found interesting was the founder\u2019s view on muggleborns.\u00a0 It seemed unlikely to Harry\u00a0 that he was as invested in pureblood superiority as wizards like Lucius Malfoy seemed to think he was, and that his selective admittance policy was more out of fear of medieval witch hunts than anything else.\u00a0 He reasoned that it was dangerous to expose young wizards to the truth of their identity when it could only endanger them in the interim years between learning they had magic and becoming trained fully enough to keep themselves safe with it.\u00a0 While Harry had to agree with that, he thought that the founders should have worked together to find ways around that instead of squabbling over ideology.\u00a0 He also thought that Salazar\u2019s idea of secretly putting a basilisk in the castle as a last line of defence in the event of a total apocalypse (or whatever reason) was a terrible idea.\u00a0 Whatever, he was just pleased that the man who\u2019d created such an incredible library wasn\u2019t an awful racist like they\u2019d thought he was.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He was so fascinated by everything he was learning that Minerva sometimes had to come down and shake him awake near curfew, when she realised he\u2019d once again fallen asleep over his books.\u00a0 Even his dormmates, who were studying desperately for exams and not in pursuit of independent knowledge, didn\u2019t spend as much time holed up in the library as he did, and the Weasley twins had teasingly placed him firmly in the same category as Hermione, Pansy, and Draco, or \u2018the nerds\u2019 of the group.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Exams were easy, and he\u2019d prepared (and studied far ahead of his grade level via Salazar\u2019s library) well enough that he could have performed them all wandlessly (although he didn\u2019t; he wasn\u2019t a show off).\u00a0 Ron groaned and said he hadn\u2019t known that Harry was as much of a bookworm as Hermione, but the truth is Harry had always been smarter than people gave him credit for.\u00a0 He had enjoyed reading, and had often hidden from Dudley and his gang the one place they would never look for him, i.e. the library.\u00a0 He just normally didn\u2019t take quite so much of an interest as Hermione, but with the discovery of the chamber library and Wood firmly prohibited from dragging the team outside to practice in the ice and snow, he had a lot of time on his hands.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry also put a lot of thought into what he should get for his now much-increased number of friends and his guardian.\u00a0 He knew Minnie liked his homemade shortbread, but that wouldn\u2019t stay fresh long, and besides, he wanted to get her something nicer than just that.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Since Snape had been so nice lately, Harry had copied the newly translated parseltongue manuscripts into nice, leather-bound notebooks.\u00a0 He had, ironically, been the easiest to take care of, gift-wise.\u00a0 Ron had gotten a limited-edition Chudley canon\u2019s jersey and some new quidditch gloves, and for Draco, Harry bought the same gloves in green and a cashmere jumper in a soft grey to match his eyes.\u00a0 Each of the Weasley twins was getting a three-month subscription to Zonko\u2019s new Surprise Me Sampler Basket, Neville, Seamus and Dean got a similar subscription from Honeyduke\u2019s, and Harry was sure that Pansy would be pleased with her soft, rose-coloured ballet flats and the lavender midi-skirt he\u2019d bought her, as the Slytherin had been expressing an interest in muggle fashion as of late.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For Susan and Hannah, Harry had Fred and George give him the spell they used on the television set and bewitched a pair of new CD players to work in the castle.\u00a0 He\u2019d gotten Minnie a felt mouse full of catnip as a joke, and all that was left before the holidays was to figure out her real present and to get something for Narcissa, Ginny, and Luna.\u00a0 Ginny was more of a tomboy than the other girls, and Luna was\u2026 well, Luna was Luna.\u00a0 Draco had told him the name of his mother\u2019s favourite jewellery shop, and Harry eventually picked out, on the advice of Du, a silver brooch in the shape of a snake with emeralds for the eyes.\u00a0 He eventually decided to get Ginny a collector\u2019s edition set of all his favourite Wonder Woman comic books, as he had a feeling she\u2019d love them as much as he did, and he found a muggle jumper with a picture of a rainbow unicorn that just screamed Luna.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Which, again, still left him without a clue for what to get Minnie.\u00a0 When he\u2019d asked if there was anything she might like, she\u2019d responded with \u201cwhy, I\u2019ve got everything I could ever need; I\u2019ve got you, dear,\u201d which, while it made Harry glow in satisfaction, brought him no closer to having something to wrap and put under the Christmas tree.\u00a0 Eventually he realised that since Minerva loved him so much, she would indubitably enjoy something made by him.\u00a0 Petunia had made him learn to knit so that he could make all her contributions for the children\u2019s charity events at the church, so he\u2019d ordered some red and gold wool and begun to knit, without using magic to speed up the process, a warm checkered shawl.\u00a0 He\u2019d tied off the last stitch on the morning school ended for the term and spent the train ride adding a fringe along the edges.\u00a0 \u00a0Minnie had stayed in her office to do some work but would be using the floo to join them at Narcissa\u2019s that night.\u00a0 As the train pulled into King\u2019s Cross, Harry slipped the shawl into his trunk with the rest of the gifts he needed to wrap and put a strong locking charm to keep his friends (especially Ron and Draco) from trying to peek at what he\u2019d gotten them.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Narcissa and Aralynn had welcomed them on the platform, and Harry liked both of them immediately.\u00a0 Draco was a bit shy about meeting his mother\u2019s long-time girlfriend, but she\u2019d swept him up into a hug right away.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDraco! \u00a0It\u2019s so good to finally see you.\u00a0 Although, with all the stories your mum\u2019s told me, I feel like I\u2019ve known you for years.\u201d\u00a0 She was wearing a soft yellow blouse with jeans and trainers, and her short hair was wind-swept from the floo-ride to the station.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t say the same, unfortunately, but it\u2019s lovely to meet the woman who\u2019s made my mum so happy.\u00a0 Are you living at the manor full-time now?\u201d\u00a0 Draco asked her.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes, I have been for a few months now.\u00a0 I haven\u2019t sold my flat yet, but if you decided you were amenable to having me around all the time I might- not for a few months though, so no pressure to make a decision about me yet.\u201d \u00a0Her laugh sounded pleasant, with a sweet little snort at the end.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Draco looked her up and down.\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll need that time.\u00a0 I like you already, and besides, my mother has impeccable taste.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Narcissa laughed.\u00a0 \u201cThat I do, dragon.\u00a0 That I do.\u00a0 It\u2019s so lovely we will be able to host all your friends and their families this year.\u201d\u00a0 She turned to the group of students.\u00a0 \u201cHarry luv, Minerva told me she\u2019ll be arriving in a few hours after she finishes grading exams, and Neville, your grandmother said she\u2019d be staying in her own manor until Christmas eve.\u00a0 Seamus, Dean, your parents have made friends with the Grangers and are currently playing muggle football in the gardens, I believe, and Molly Weasley has commandeered my kitchen for the past three days and has made so many goodies, I soon won\u2019t fit into my robes.\u201d\u00a0 She laughed and winked at Ginny, who was closest to her out of all the Weasleys, and then looked at Luna, who was leaning against the redhead\u2019s shoulder.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLuna, I must say, your father is a fascinating man.\u00a0 He was going to accompany us to bring you all back, but we wanted to be less of a crowd, and besides, he been distracted in the library, painting all the horklumps?\u201d\u00a0 Her face betrayed she hadn\u2019t the foggiest clue what that meant, but Luna smiled serenely, so Narcissa waved them all through to the floo at the end of the platform.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Harry swore he had never seen a house as impressive as Malfoy manner.\u00a0 In its own way, seeing it gave him the same sense of awe as Hogwarts had, although in a different way.\u00a0 The magic, in place of the busy, vibrant warmth of the castle, had a more subdued but comforting feel, and the colours were mainly soft pastels instead of the vivid brightness that overwhelmed him at school when he didn\u2019t close off his senses.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDo you like it, Harry?\u201d Narcissa asked, looking at his wide eyes.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s amazing, Mrs. Malfoy,\u201d he smiled at her, and she ran a thumb along the dimple in his right cheek.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPlease dear, call me Narcissa, or Cissa\u2019s even better.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOkay,\u201d he blushed again, and Narcissa thought that surely he was the most adorable child she\u2019d ever seen (well, Draco was equally as cute when he wanted to be, she supposed, but he was her child so she had to say that).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMinerva should be here soon; in the meantime, why don\u2019t you show Harry your room, Draco,\u201d Narcissa turned to her son, who nodded and dragged Harry away by the hand.\u00a0 Cissa smiled at her before dragging Aralynn away to their room.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ***\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWoah, Draco, your room is so cool!\u201d Harry enthused as he looked around the giant bedroom.\u00a0 In the centre was a giant canopied four-poster bed with sky blue bedding, and a pair of silver and green painted dragons flew and twirled about on the painted walls.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThanks, I designed it myself,\u201d Draco said, blushing brilliantly.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cUm\u2026\u201d there was an awkward silence on the blonde\u2019s end as Harry fascinatedly took in the rest of the room and Draco wondered what he should say next. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDo you wanna play chess?\u201d he eventually asked, watching the shorter boy examine the marble set on the activity table.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harry agreed, and spent the next few hours playing with his friends and losing spectacularly.\u00a0 He was trying to coax a rook into capturing Draco\u2019s night (it was a trap, of course) when there was a knock on the

now she was frowning over Harry\u2019s medical files.\u00a0 Madame Pomphrey had been hoping to be able to start giving him his vaccinations by now, but with the state of his immune system at this point, a vaccination would only make him sick.\u00a0 The immune-boosting potions were a poor substitute for an actual, well-developed immune system, and Harry had been in the hospital wing with a bad cold or case of the flu three times already since the return to school after the Yule holidays.\u00a0 Severus was worried as well (he would, of course, deny this if asked) and was trying to develop a more effective potion since the standard brew wasn\u2019t working as hoped.\u00a0 But it was a tricky thing to make an industrial strength potion that would be safe to give an underweight twelve-year-old.\u00a0 It was\u2026 a troubling conundrum, and Minerva was rubbing her temples when she felt something nudging her ankles.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 She looked down to see a tiny black kitten bumping her insistently with its little nose.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHello dear.\u00a0 Have you lost your owner?\u201d She gently leaned down to pick up the little guy when it looked at her with brilliant green eyes.\u00a0 Emerald eyes.\u00a0 The kitten looked at her intelligently and mewed.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHarry?

kitten into cute little wizard again.\u201d\u00a0 Harry hissed grumpily as Minnie picked him up by the scruff of the neck and brought him to an open area in the middle of her

\u201cBut at least don\u2019t tell professor Snape,\u201d he begged, referencing his guardian\u2019s habit of fondly regaling the staff room with his exploits.\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019ll never let me live it down!\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSorry dear,\u201d his guardian told him, not sounding at all sorry.\u00a0 \u201cBut Severus is responsible for working with Poppy on your potions regimen, and a brewer needs to know about any special conditions like an animagus

told him, trying not to laugh.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh Merlin, I\u2019m never gonna hear the end of this\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Severus did excessively tease Harry about his animagus form, but he also excessively threatened the ministry official who registered him, the result being that Harry\u2019s status as an animagus (however adorable it may be) was kept out of the Daily Prophet.\u00a0 And alright\u2026 it must be admitted that his new tiny, furry skill was wonderful for perpetuating their prank war on Lockhart, who, in addition to being bald and yellow-teethed, had been proven to be a fraud.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 It turned out he was only too willing to make conversation with the kitten who\u2019d started visiting him in his office, which included telling him all his secrets, such as the fact that he wasn\u2019t really a competent wizarding hero (go figure) and also that he had a deathly fear of spiders (and if Harry\u2019s new kitten form happened to be wonderful at hunting, catching, and relocating spiders to Lockhart\u2019s quarters, well\u2026).\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lockhart\u2019s secrets being released to the public (and he still couldn\u2019t figure out how the Weasley twins had managed to get that recording.\u00a0 The only one he ever talked to about his deepest, darkest secrets was that friendly little kitten\u2026) had embarrassed him to such a degree that he had immediately resigned his post, effective as soon as the school year ended.\u00a0 His classes had gone from awful re-enactments of his shitty books to quietly studying defence from a standard-issue textbook, occasionally punctuated by the sounds of sobbing.\u00a0 March turned into April, Harry got the flu again, April turned into May, the Weasley twins somehow became the first to claim the honour of having ridden the giant squid, and then May turned into June, during which finals were completed without fuss (the entire group had decided to utilize Hermione\u2019s study plan this semester, although Ron did so with some grumbling) and Mrs. Norris was revived and sent to Filch\u2019s new address in a perforated box.\u00a0 Soon it was the night of the goodbye feast, and the Harry and his happy little group of friends were sitting at the Hufflepuff table laughing at some reference to one of the muggle telly programmes they all gathered in the Gryffindor common room to watch.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t believe Slytherin and Gryffindor tied for the house cup this year,\u201d Pansy was saying.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAt least no \u2018last-minute points\u2019 were awarded this time.\u00a0 That trick Dumbledore pulled last year was rather
