    "text": "\u201cI can\u2019t believe I just watched you lose so  disastrously to a bunch of fifteen year olds,\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nComes Robin\u2019s voice from the backseat, piping up after a calm moment of silence where Steve  wasn\u2019t  being tormented in his own car. A little handful of giggles follow, Dustin, Max, Lucas and  Eddie, all deviously chuckling away at his transgressions.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah, yeah, laugh it up. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m wasting all my gas driving you guys back home later,\u201d Steve tosses a glare over his shoulder, shutting up only Lucas, who gives him a little polite smile, still twinged with mischief.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nEddie grins, rugged and effortlessly attractive in a way that has his stomach turning. \u201cNo, she\u2019s right, Stevie, who knew bowling was your weakness?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMaybe I was just letting Will win. It\u2019s his birthday, asshole,\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBullllllshit! Will didn\u2019t even  win,  Max did!\u201d Dustin protests from his place in the front seat, pointing accusingly. \u201cYou put the ball in the gutter  every time!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPipe down, dipshit, you\u2019re distracting me, the driver, remember? Driving you guys around?\u201d Steve scolds, scowling off into space, taking a slightly more aggressive turn than necessary.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nWill\u2019s birthday was a pretty big affair, a warm day in May just as they all recovered from the fight against Vecna. They\u2019d just stopped the fourth gate from opening by the skin of their teeth\u2014Hopper\u2019s government friends arriving just in time to stop Jason from helping Vecna kill Max by proxy, leaving her with just the  one broken arm.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nEddie had got out of the Hawkin\u2019s Lab hospital pretty recently, after Steve had lugged his sorry half-corpse through the portal in the weak hope that they could do  something\u2014 and they did. His heart stopped a few too many times and now they were worried about long term complications, or something, some new technology called a heart monitor\u2014but right now he was lax, leaned back and grinning in the backseat of his car, continuously catching his eye in the rear view mirror.\n\n\n\n\nSteve had a gnarly scar, raised and angry across his throat, one that looked like someone had tried to slit it, or something\u2014but Eddie had said it was pretty sick. Plus, it was a contributor to why they\u2019d been stuck in the hospital together for a couple weeks. Turns out the bats  did have rabies, sort of\u2014at least some kind of sickness, like the flu, or the plague, as Robin had said.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(It was pretty cool having matching scars with Eddie where the bats had taken huge chunks out of their torsos, but no normal person would ever fucking say that, so Steve kept that one to himself.)\n\n\n\n\nSo now they were on the way to some corny, kiddy pizza place, one of the new ones with animal robot mascots and shit, but more excitingly\u2014an arcade. Pizza, plus arcade? Happy kids. Very, very happy kids.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nHappy kids who were very excited to get there, who slammed the doors of his car on their way out even as he grumbled in warning to  not do that, ignoring him entirely as they reunited with the other cars in the lot.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nJoyce had hitched a ride in Hopper\u2019s new station wagon, Will, El and Mike all stuffed in the back, Jonathan and Nancy pulling up shortly afterwards, ABBA blaring out of the car speakers as they did.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAnd it was nice, he thought, sunglasses slightly askew on his face as he tilted his head up to enjoy the sun, the corners of his eyes crinkling as he took a deep breath in, preparing himself for hyper, angsty teens and the greasy power of pizza.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThen comes a hand on the small of his back\u2014Eddie, friendly, touchy Eddie, who shoots him a smile before chasing on after Dustin.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nSteve swallows, trying not to think about the gesture  too hard, before setting off, lagging behind the group a little as a result. And it\u2019s strangely nice, comforting, sort of, watching them all from behind, watching the way they move together, a small, friendly army. Studying the way they\u2019ve healed, grown older, grown together.\n\u00a0\nThen he realizes it\u2019s sort of creepy, and starts jogging to keep up\u2014when he notices the bracelet.\n\u00a0\nEl\u2019s bracelet. The little blue one she\u2019s had on her wrist for a while. It\u2019s fallen just a little way from where she\u2019s walking now, just ahead of Steve.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCrouching down, he scoops it up\u2014calling out to her. There\u2019s a pause where she turns back and looks a tad baffled, because it\u2019s not like her and Steve have ever  spoken, really, but they\u2019ve meshed together in the midst of alternate dimension battle, and that\u2019s always sort of been enough.\n\u00a0\nHe wiggles the bracelet in the air, smiling at her warmly, growing into a grin when her face lights up in recognition, and she jogs a little awkwardly over to his beckoning.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut it\u2019s when he turns, just at a slightly different angle, adjusting to be able to give it to her, does he see something in the corner of his eye, just behind them. A shift, a form, a man.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt only takes a glance, an inch of movement for Steve to see  something  thrown, or  drawn  aggressively upwards in the direction of the approaching Eleven, who\u2019s yet to notice. Nobody else  has noticed.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJust Steve.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSteve, who grabs Eleven and tosses the two of them in a completely different direction, a choked apology tumbling out of his mouth as he knocks her to the floor hard enough to leave a nasty bruise. He\u2019s not really sure if he even managed to get it out before he\u2019s standing over her, staring down at the sheer terror and confusion that marks her like a deer in headlights.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree shots ring out.\n\u00a0\nSteve hears them before he feels them; a warm, wet pain burning in his torso, intolerably excruciating.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere\u2019s a bundle of squawks and screams, outbursts of panic and anger, and it\u2019s only when Hopper falls forwards to take Steve up into a slightly rough, protective hold, does he realize that two of those shots have lodged themselves in his own flesh and bone. (Realizes that he\u2019d moved, instinctively, to shield El, despite never having spoken to her, who\u2019d the gun had been so precisely pointed at, aimed for.)\n\u00a0\nSteve Harrington watches his own blood pool and trickle over a series of hands pressed against him, small and large, soft and rugged, and for a moment, wants to stay like this. He can\u2019t.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nBecause then Joyce is running for a phone, and Jonathan has Will pressed against him as if he expects another round, another gun; perhaps a relic of their time in California, something Steve had always meant to ask about but never managed to. Nancy is trying to wrangle Max, who\u2019s shouting and fighting to get away\u2014get to  him, he realizes, vaguely, while Robin pushes past them to do just that, her shaking hands trying to soothe him, one on his face while the other braces her body against the concrete of the pavement he\u2019s begun to bleed out on.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThe kids\u2014he thinks, in a fleeting moment of panic\u2014only to find them all, crowding the gaggle of limbs he\u2019s become, listless and entirely out of his control. Their hands pressed hard enough to scald, so when Steve choked on his own startled sob; he blamed it partly on the pain, another on the mere idea that these kids even know what to do when someone they know is shot in broad daylight.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nLucas is looking wildly back and forth between Steve and Max, as if trying to choose who to try and comfort, and Steve wills the dead weight of his tongue to move, to tell him to go to her; any attempt is shushed by Mike, who looks furious. It\u2019s a familiar expression\u2014identical to Nancy\u2019s anger, all contained to the small downward curve of their lip, stuffed into that compact countenance when they know it\u2019s not the time or place to let it run free.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThen there\u2019s Dustin, who\u2019s causing the most trouble for Hopper, practically on top of Steve, periodically shaking him back and forth by the shoulders. He only gets a handful of the constant stream of heartbroken shrieking that comes tumbling from his mouth, a collection of \u201cDon\u2019t do this to me Steve,\u201ds and \u201cStay awake, you can\u2019t do this,\u201ds, \u201cYou can\u2019t do this to me,\u201ds. Tears streaming down round cheeks, one disrupted by a broken handprint of already-drying blood, probably from the one he can no longer feel.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nSteve doesn\u2019t remember touching Dustin\u2019s face, searches for it in the occasional blackouts he keeps falling victim to; supposing that it\u2019s just second nature, at this point. To try and comfort him first. But the more he tastes the bitter bile in the back of his throat, the metallic taste of blood in his mouth, trickling down his chin, does that become more difficult to do.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(He wonders, briefly, if this is how Eddie felt. The sickening, feverish guilt of making the kid who practically worships you sob about your possible, impending, looking pretty likely death.)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Then Steve gets to thinking about Eddie, searches for him, in the gaggle of his terrified onlookers, and finds him, uncharacteristically silent with sheer anguish as he hovers, too scared to get too close. For all of the hands pressed to Steve, big and small, he longs, for a second, for the limp, ring-clad fist at Eddie\u2019s side to grasp at him too, and finds himself too far gone to speculate about why that might be.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nMaybe he asked, though, he\u2019s not sure he can speak at all\u2014or maybe the look in his eyes was pleading enough; pathetic enough. Because as soon as Eddie chances a glance in his direction, he\u2019s collapsing to his knees by Steve\u2019s side, taking his wrist between two rough palms, lacing their fingers together until the cool metal of his rings has a bloody chuckle oozing out of his mouth.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nIt hurts to do, sets a fire of wet, fresh agony alight in his chest, but he wins, really. Eddie meets his eyes, a melancholy fondness growing in them, pooling in the form of tears at their corners, and smiles at him crookedly, setting one of his hands against Steve\u2019s face, thumb brushing beneath one of his eyes. \u201cCmon, man. You\u2019ve got this.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nSteve\u2019s not sure what he\u2019s got, but if it has Eddie looking at him like that, it must be pretty great.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re Steve  Harrington.  You\u2019re\u2014the most metal guy I know. Bat-wielding, bat-fucking-teeth-shredding  maniac. \u201d Steve\u2019s not really sure what Eddie\u2019s saying, but that\u2019s comforting in a sense, because Steve isn\u2019t really ever sure what Eddie\u2019s trying to say.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d Comes the bubbling, anxious addition from Robin, who\u2019s lap is cushioning his head, sharing the weight of his enervated body with Hopper. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2014you\u2019ve, we\u2019ve, survived  way  , way-way-way-  way  worse than this, Steve, you can\u2019t\u2014it\u2019s. It\u2019s just a couple bullets. It\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s not so bad. You\u2019re gonna be totally fine, cuz if you aren\u2019t, I\u2019m gonna have to pick up your shifts at work too, and that\u2019s gonna totally blow, because, well, think of all\u2014all the babes you\u2019ll miss, and I\u2019ll\u2014I\u2019ll have to organize the tapes according to, to  my  recommendations, and you\u2014you know my movie choices totally suck, you can\u2019t,\u201d She draws in a gasp of air, chest heaving. \u201cYou have to be there, you know\u2014you know I\u2019m totally useless under the crushing pressure of responsibility, Steve, I\u2019ll totally get us both fired and I\u2019ll feel  so, so bad,\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nIf she wasn\u2019t already crying, she was now, a steady stream of sobs wracking her jittering form as she leaned over him, panicked babbles now just whimpers and cries. Maybe that\u2019s what breaks the real headline to Steve, the breaking news of,  you\u2019re going to die this time.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\nBecause Nancy pulls Robin away from him, gathering her into her fierce arms and holding the girl with such a force that it sets Steve\u2019s head spinning\u2014wondering if they had really become that close after Vecna, or if Steve was really, really screwed. It starts to feel like the latter, because then he finds Max at his feet, cradled by Lucas as she grips his shins and cusses him out, and she\u2019s bawling, too. It makes him uneasy; Max hadn\u2019t cried in front of Steve since they\u2019d caught her, saved her from Vecna\u2019s curse at the foot of Billy\u2019s grave\u2014that thought brought a crushing revelation to the drowning attentiveness he had left.\n\n\n\n\nMaybe that\u2019s what this all reminds her of. That\u2019s what Steve is doing to her, here, forcing her to relive that again. He feels sick, his own blood spilling out over his own lips, watching Dustin and Max sobbing over him as his actions force them to experience some of their worst trauma all over again.\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s what finally gets him talking again, picking up his tongue from where it lay, dead, in his mouth, dragging it to form the panicked prattle of apologies that he can\u2019t stop once they start; a sorry for Hopper, who he\u2019s collapsed against, bleeding all over, Joyce, who\u2019s shouting at onlookers hysterically, desperate to help him, Robin, who\u2019s not even trying to hide how she feels this situation is going to go, having a full-blown panic attack in Nancy\u2019s arms, who he apologizes to, too, for everything, past and present, to Jonathan, who\u2019s resembling a kicked puppy, the way that had Steve hesitate in feeling resentment for him all those years ago, now just turning a fresh blanket of guilt in his gut, for Will, who\u2019s birthday he\u2019s just absolutely fucking ruined, Mike, for never quite understanding him as much as the other kids, for dying to save his super-powered girlfriend, Dustin, for giving him the rapport of fatherly, brotherly support he\u2019d so desperately needed only to rob away from him now, Lucas, for forever forcing him to join him in being the more mature one of the kids, for leaving him in the Creel House to get near beat to death by Jason while he was out of reach in the upside down, Max, for usurping Billy as her brother, only to leave her in the same way, leaving her more vulnerable to Vecna, should he ever return, to Eddie, for every King-Steve lookalike who\u2019s ever called him shit that makes his stomach turn to hear now, for every member of the godforsaken town who still graffitis his trailer, still throws things at him on the streets despite the Hawkin\u2019s Lab fantastic, government pardon they\u2019d donned as soon as the situation was \u2018contained,\u2019 and for not having enough energy to understand why he\u2019d liked wearing his vest jacket so much, or why he\u2019s so needily searching his eyes for the answer now, the light around his vision beginning to fade.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAnd to El. For forcing her to experience someone else dying in her stead, for putting the weight of his life on her shoulders along with the rest of the world, for layering a fresh coating of blood on her hands, giving her another nightmare to live with forever.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThat last apology has Hopper grip him tighter, suddenly, as if he\u2019d decided that Steve couldn\u2019t do that, couldn\u2019t damage his daughter even more than his previous failures already had. Large arms scoop under his, searing, white hot pain climbing him in vines and branches as the newly-reinstated police chief begins bodily dragging him across the pavement towards the small gathering of cars parked at the roadside, ignoring the screams that rub his throat raw, the pain so bad it sinks him into the suffocating darkness of near-unconsciousness multiple times.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThe next time his vision returns, he\u2019s splayed across the backseat of a car he doesn\u2019t recognize, and his words are so heavy in his mouth he can\u2019t shift his tongue to speak. This doesn\u2019t stop him from trying, only to find a hand cradling his face, shushing him. They smell vaguely of flowery perfume and the confusing addition of a faint, cheap men\u2019s cologne. Had he been in a better state of mind, he probably could\u2019ve played the gentle, motherly touches as Joyce\u2014unfortunately, he wasn\u2019t, and instead what came was a strained, pitiful little wheeze.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMom?\u201d To be fair to himself, he couldn\u2019t really see, or feel, past the pain\u2014but he felt her stiffen beneath the limp strength of his neck.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nA gruff voice is muttering away in the front seat, and part of Steve is sure he can recognize the tone, the vague outline of the body even as it swerves and jolts. Driving with such a force that the three people in the back cradling Steve keep holding too tight, choking a wailing scream out of him, deliriously thrashing with as much force as he can muster before a colorful harmony of strained voices pull him back into place, before he inevitably falls back into the cool darkness of before.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0There\u2019s Hopper, screaming at Dustin, who\u2019s in the front seat and keeps screaming at  him,  fearless in the face of Steve\u2019s fickle chances of survival as they hurtle their way towards the hospital, having decided the ambulance wouldn\u2019t get to them in time. Now reaching the sixth minute since the undercover American government agent pulled a gun and shot two rounds into Steve before Hopper returned the favor, blowing his brains out on the sun-warmed pavements of Hawkin\u2019s central town plaza, they were swiftly running out of time. The sentiment was all the more urgent whenever Robin would cry out that Steve had fallen asleep again and  wouldn\u2019t wake up, Hopper instructing Eddie, sat between Joyce and Robin with his hands pushing down on Steve\u2019s bleeding torso, to push down harder, use the pain to wake him up again.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nEvery blood-curdling scream that came out of the guy\u2019s mouth brought bile to the back of Eddie\u2019s throat, the dry feeling of Steve\u2019s flaking blood between his fingers mingling with the fresh, wet, thick renewal of it from the wounds he\u2019s trying and failing to keep enough pressure on almost enough to have him faint himself. The only things keeping  him  awake is the distressed shrieking of Dustin in the front seat, the white knuckles of Robin, whose fingers are digging into his arm hard enough to draw blood, the firm trust of Hopper and the fear of his disapproval, for he\u2019d pointed at him, hand bloody from Steve\u2019s paling body, and said, \u201c  You, Munson, come with us, now,\u201d\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\nHe was the chosen one, in all of this. Robin was Steve\u2019s soulmate, in a sense, she could never leave him and fled Nancy\u2019s embrace to do just that. Dustin was similar, though at first Hopper protested, they had no time for arguments, the boy throwing himself into the shotgun of the \u201cborrowed\u201d civilian truck.\u00a0\nJoyce\u2014he hardly knew the woman, outside of the warm hug she\u2019d given him that one time when he\u2019d given Will a lift home as a new member of Hellfire (Rebranded to Demobat\u2019s Dungeon to avoid persecution) and thanked him, for letting Will play, for being kind to him, as if he  wouldn\u2019t be. She was cradling Steve\u2019s upper body now, uncaring for the blood and gore he shed over her clothes, something he thought impossible for a middle aged mother, who, in his imagination, were all about hating stains and keeping things pristine.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nWhich is probably why the faces of his fellow passengers looked so grim when Steve spoke up through his spotty wakefulness to ask after her as if she truly was his mother\u2014a sign that they were on the brink of losing him for good.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nSteve\u2019s eyes were rolling back into his skull until all Eddie could see were the whites of them, not the deep, chocolate-brown, puppy-like gaze he was so used to pining after, seeking, and all he could think of was Chrissy, the thud of her body on his floor, the weight of her in his arms when she refused to wake up.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u201c Steve.  Steve, man, you gotta stay awake for me,\u201d He pushes his hands down into the blood again, cringing at the feeling of the raw flesh, but when it doesn\u2019t earn him a heart-wrenching cry from the boy splayed across his lap, he falters, going cold all over. \u201cSteve. Steve?  Steve!\u201d\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\nCasting a hand over his face, Eddie grips him by the chin, trying to rouse some kind of signs of life while Dustin\u2019s crying hikes back up again in the front seat, Robin spewing panicked rambles about what he should and shouldn\u2019t do to wake him, Joyce and Hopper shouting over each other from the opposite ends of the car.\n\n\n\n\nEddie slaps him, then, though he doesn\u2019t really remember doing it, just the burning aftertaste of guilt when those eyes flutter open again, drowning in confusion as they lull up to stare at him. \u201cThere we go, that\u2019s it, pretty boy, keep those eyes on me, you got it? Let\u2019s not sleep just yet, Stevie,\u201d He casts one hand through his hair, stroking the side of his face, Joyce mirroring his actions a little more delicately.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nSteve just looks entirely too confused for it to be fair, in this situation, the situation  he  put himself in, in the line of fire, like a hero,  again\u2014  but then he starts humming, and Eddie\u2019s throat goes dry, not needing to warn the driver that they were running out of time, running out of  Steve,  and any sense he ever had  left.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\nBut then he listens, just a little, amongst the sounds of anguish, at the gentle, rasping tune Steve hums to him, cold, limp hand doing its best to grip the front of his shirt.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n Hmm, hmm hmmm hmmm. Hmm-hhm hrmm hmm hmmmm. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d And Eddie laughs, then, because Steve had been complaining about missing  the most metal concert ever,  as described by Dustin, and Eddie had fulfilled his promise to play it for him just the other day, a little stoned, a little drunk on his full attention. And now Steve was bleeding out in his lap, trying his very best to hum Metallica\u2019s  Master of the Puppets  to him as he died.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEddie,\u201d Steve\u2019s hand flops weakly, an invitation, one he takes readily, looking at a worried Robin briefly before returning his full attention to the man of the hour. \u201cEd.  Ed\u2014 \u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nHis throat feels like sandpaper. \u201cSave your strength, Stevie boy, you\u2019re not looking so hot right now,\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2014well that\u2019s, that\u2019s rude,\u201d Comes the bloody giggle, lips and teeth stained with it as he chokes out any quip he can muster. \u201cYou don\u2019t think I\u2019m\u2014pretty, Ed? I thought I was,  pretty boy, to\u2014to you,\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nSomething settles in his gut, a warmth, yet also a dread. \u201cCome on Stevie, don\u2019t do this to me right now,\u201d He casts another bloody hand through his hair, inexplicably fond.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d It\u2019s so  earnest,  it hurts, and it has Robin shout at Hopper to go  faster.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n \u201cHey,\u201d Eddie jostles him a little. \u201cWe already heard your apologies, Stevie, I don\u2019t think we can take any more.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nJoyce nods silently in agreement, giving Steve\u2019s hand a little squeeze.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBut\u2014your jacket. Ed, Eddie, you, I need to,\u201d He coughs, a handful of blood spilling out of his mouth, down his chin and neck, eyes rolling back again. \u201cIt\u2019s, I\u2014folded. In my, table, by\u2014by my bed. I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t get it,\u201d Another wet cough. \u201cBack to you. I meant to.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nHe doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s crying until he feels wet hot tears running over the slightly lopsided bridge of his nose, sniffling a little as he gives Steve another gentle slap to the cheek. \u201cHey now. It suits you, Stevie. I thought I told you to keep that thing?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nBut he\u2019s gone, lulling back into the intoxicating draught of the unconscious, the whites of his eyes twitching uncomfortably through thick, damp eyelashes, before Robin takes her turn, hitting Steve in a frustrated move of pure distress, gripping his face with both hands, determined.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRob?\u201d Steve\u2019s eyes bounce up and down and back, misty and milky and far too distant to be right. \u201cRobin, we gotta\u2014we\u2019re gonna be sooo,\u201d He hiccups. \u201cSo, so late for work, Rob, it\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll tell\u2026! Keith,  Keith, I\u2019ll tell \u2018im I\u2026 forgot, that I have a car, \u2018n he\u2019ll just \u2018ave\u2019a go, \u2018t me,\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u201c Steve,\u201d Robin weeps, bitterly, pressing a firm kiss to his forehead, one of her tears beginning to roll down his face from where it had dropped from her.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nHe goes again, for longer this time, pale enough and breathing so shallow that Eddie was sure, for just a moment that he\u2019d died, dedicating his last words to  Keith, of all people\u2014but after Joyce had cried out to Hopper and he cut a corner hard enough to climb the curb, Steve had startled awake again, eyelids heavy and pupils blown wide.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDustin, I\u2014I gotta, find Dustin,\u201d His eyes don\u2019t fix on anyone, voice feebly begging to anyone listening. \u201cM\u2019s \u2018Ender\u2019sson, she ge\u2019s so, so  worried,  s\u2019mmhm, givin\u2019 mhm a liff\u2019\u2019ome, \u2018ome where\u2019s\u2026 where\u2019s my  kid, I can\u2019\u2014I can\u2019 fin\u2019d\u2019im,\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nSteve\u2019s sobbing, tears mixing with blood, staining his supple face with tracks of agony. \u201cI can\u2019 t find\u2019m,\u201d\n\n\n\n\nOne of his hands grips Eddie\u2019s hard enough to bruise. \u201cY\u2019gotta\u2014y\u2019gggh. Y\u2019ggh,\u201d And he looks up to meet eyes with Dustin, who\u2019s abandoned his front seat, climbing as much as he can into the back to reach for Steve, reach for  Eddie,  crying hard enough that he can feel it in his  chest, a deep, primal reaction.\n\n\n\n\n\u201c Steve,\u201d  Dustin eventually manages, leaning over the seat to hold his head, tilt it his way. But Steve looks past him, at first, eyes distant and foggy.  \u201cSteve!\u201d\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s just a second, a fleeting moment, a final one\u2014where those deep, beautiful eyes clear, just long enough to see Dustin. A gentle, fond smile stretches across his face, barely there, as Steve uses the last of his strength to drag his hand over where Dustin\u2019s rests, over his heart, and threads one or two of their fingers together.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nJust a second.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nBecause Eddie watches, firsthand, as despondent horror grows on Dustin\u2019s face. He feels the last of Steve\u2019s body go limp, head falling back into his lap.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nFeels as the last of his life leaves him, stretched out across them like a martyr.\u00a0\n\nThe next time Steve opens his eyes, he\u2019s younger. Everything is, really\u2014his house, carpets softer than the hardwood floors in the foyer now, walls still the gently peach colour they were when he was a kid, reminiscent of the warmer colours of the seventies. There\u2019s a picture hanging there, one that no longer does so\u2014it\u2019s a family portrait, when getting those taken was the trend of the week in Hawkin\u2019s suburbia.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve can see his murky reflection in the glass of the frame before he looks through it\u2014and fleetingly, he knows he must be about seven, about \n\nmiserable, \n\nthe hand of his father gripping his shoulder just a little too firmly. If he tries, he can still remember the light purple indents, the bruises, left from posing for that stupid, ugly picture, remembers being nine, watching his mother use it as ammunition the third or fourth time Harrington Senior was caught having an affair on a \u2018business trip.\u2019\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019d been when they\u2019d begun to go together every time, after that argument, when nobody had picked up the broken glass from the picture frame and Steve had stayed quiet about the piece he\u2019d accidentally stepped on, the piece he\u2019d pulled out of the flesh of his foot like a ribbon from a gift, bleeding all over the pristine tiles of his en-suite bathroom. When his mother wanted to be certain, at least, that his father was sleeping with a prostitute in the motel room next door. It was less humiliating for her, in that way.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nBut where Steve is now, the portrait still hangs. So Steve must be seven.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nHe wonders why, distantly. If he\u2019s dead, why would this be the afterlife? He thinks fleetingly about a debate he had with Nancy one (though nobody could really \n\ndebate \n\nwith Nancy), about how heaven wasn\u2019t real, how she\u2019d said that people who \u2018saw the light\u2019 had all just experienced some trick of their dying brain chemistry.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nMaybe that was this.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nIt doesn\u2019t really matter, because Steve feels himself grow detached, falling back into the footfalls he\u2019d practiced to be quiet back then, as the Harringtons liked their son to be seen, not heard; though sometimes the first wasn\u2019t applicable, either.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve Harrington is seven years old. It is the week before Christmas, and Steve Harrington is seven years old, Steve Harrington is home alone for the first time. Steve Harrington is not very good at reading, or math, but he can run faster than most boys in his class, which is why Kelly and Jenny and Tiffany and Shannon all have crushes on him at the moment.\u00a0\n\n\nSteve Harrington is seven years old, and he\u2019s lost two of his baby teeth, one of which was wobbly, so his dad tied a string to it and the door handle, slamming it until it flew out in a bloody mess, because Harrington men don\u2019t ever do things halfway.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve Harrington is home alone, he\u2019s seven years old, and he\u2019s scared of the dark. Steve hasn\u2019t slept properly since his parents left on their trip, because Steve is scared of the dark, and has never been on his own for this long before, and Steve is scared. Steve wants to come and live with Tommy H and his family, because Tommy H is also scared of the dark, and they bought him a nightlight instead of locking him in a cupboard for a little while.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Steve doesn\u2019t know Tommy H\u2019s landline number by heart, doesn\u2019t really get how the phone works, and it is much, much too dark to try and walk to his house now.\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve Harrington is seven years old when he falls down the stairs\u2014it\u2019s not the first time he\u2019s done it, he crawled backwards as a baby. But this time Steve trips at the top of the stairs because he can\u2019t keep his eyes open any longer, and his head hits the bottom step with a sickening \n\ncrack, \n\na crack so loud that for a moment he thinks he\u2019s dead. Steve Harrington is seven when he blacks out worrying about the small pool of blood that empties itself from the head wound, staining his mother\u2019s nice, fluffy carpets.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nMaybe that\u2019s why they got rid of the carpets, Steve doesn\u2019t really remember. What he does remember is trying to single-handedly care for the first, (not the last) and one of the worst concussions of his life. He remembers throwing up for days, struggling to stay awake, fighting to eat any of the pre-made sandwiches his mother had made with numbers stuck to the white sliced bread so he wouldn\u2019t eat them all in one go.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nHe remembers crying on that same step that almost killed him when his parents got home on Christmas Eve, screaming about the sick stains, blood stains, but did not so much as tut over the large dip in the side of his head, one Steve can still find with his fingertips if he studies his scalp for long enough.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe remembers forcing himself not to cry when his dad took the Christmas bike wrapped up for little Steve apart piece by piece, scattering it across their garage. Remembers spending Christmas Day trying to rebuild it, believing he had, and trying to ride it to Tommy H\u2019s house, only to discover that mechanics would never really be his thing when the wheel came off after a few pedals, and he still managed to break his little wrist.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nBut that\u2019s not quite how it goes this time. Seven year old Steve Harrington lies in his halo of sticky, hot blood at the bottom of the stairs, and is convinced that he\u2019s dying. Only this time, the front door opens, and a girl, one much taller and older than him, stands there, a gentle stream of blood dripping from her nose.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe has no hair, which little Steve finds sort of weird, but he can\u2019t really say that, because it\u2019s rude, and Steve gets into trouble when he\u2019s rude. He doesn\u2019t complain when the bald girl crouches by him and frowns, giving the dip in his head a little \n\ntut, \n\nand does her best to carry him to the leather sofas in his living room.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve thinks she\u2019s sort of strong, because his mother says he\u2019s too heavy to carry these days, but this girl with no hair carried him sorta far, and she didn\u2019t even drop him.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Steve is too far away now to really remember that this is a memory, entirely warm and content in letting Eleven invade the discomforts of the past and right them, at least for now, bundling him in warm blankets from the laundry closet, the nice ones that he\u2019s not allowed to touch.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nHe lets himself curl up in her lap, lets the child of the past receive a sense of closure, and distantly sort of understands why he\u2019s here. He supposes it\u2019s meant to be some kind of lesson, a relinquishment, a promise that he\u2019s capable of letting someone else take care of him. And he does, he lets seven year old Steve Harrington be cradled, ignoring the bratty urge to exclaim that he\u2019s way too old for this, when really he never really stopped craving this sort of care, even now.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt will be ok,\u201d The girl with no hair says, putting her hand to his temples with just the tiniest pinch of pressure. It feels a little bit like she\u2019s rifling through his brain, but seven year old Steve doesn\u2019t really mind, he\u2019s hit his head so hard it feels like cotton between his ears anyway. \u201cBut you need to wake up. Steve. So you have to\u2026 fall asleep.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIt makes no sense. It\u2019s nonsense, little Steve thinks, with a dopey smile. But he\u2019s tired, and the girl with no hair is gently patting his hair like his mother used to do when he was really, really tiny, so he doesn\u2019t really protest. He just wiggles a little until he\u2019s comfortable on the cool leather of the sitting room sofa, gives a weak little sniffle, and lets his heavy eyes fall shut.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd it\u2019s like one of those dreams, where you fall off a tall building, the adrenaline your brain fools itself with startling you awake in a fit of sweats and a racing heart rate.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve sits up, only to grab his side and \n\nscream, \n\nbecause it burns, red-hot pain, and he can\u2019t move for wires, tubes and stiff white bed sheets, black spots behind his eyes as he fights the urge to pass out from the agony of it all.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lights flicker, just for a minute, and he uses them as a distraction to take in his surroundings, finding the girl from his dream\u2014\n\nEleven, \n\nso his \u2018dream,\u2019 then, at the foot of his bed, trying to subtly wipe the blood from her nose.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThey told me not to,\u201d She says earnestly. \u201cBut every one is upset. They need to know that you are okay.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve just stares, wheezing softly through the oxygen mask strapped to his face.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nEleven just looks a little guilty. \u201cThey need you. I could\u2026 feel you. Hiding, in your\u2026 head. They need you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd before Steve can protest, she flees, pulling the door nearly-closed behind her without so much as touching it, abandoning him with his foggy thoughts and excruciating pain.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nHe\u2019s not alone for long\u2014Nancy takes her place in a flurry, Jonathan at her heels in a trance that Steve isn\u2019t sure whether to blame on weed, stress or exhaustion. And she\u2019s chewing him out, he knows that she is\u2014but he\u2019s so fuzzy, so confused, that eventually she stops, and holds his hand in a way that once he would\u2019ve taken as a sign. Now he just struggles to give it a weak squeeze in return, and dares to take Jonathan\u2019s hand, too, from where it awkwardly sits at his bedside, to the boy\u2019s complete shock.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m,\u201d His voice is so raw it hurts, at first. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about Will. I know, you\u2026 you wanted today to be good for him.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s a serious possibility, Steve thinks, that Jonathan considers socking him in the face. Because he\u2019s wearing an expression similar to the \n\nlast \n\ntime Steve spoke about Will, during their alleyway scuffle, all screwed up like an angry pug.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nHe doesn\u2019t, though, instead he just grips Steve\u2019s hand hard enough to hurt, and struggles with his words, because the two of them are civil, sure, but this is way out of their comfort zone. \u201cSure, this, totally\u2026 sucks, for a birthday, but I think Will\u2019s day would be way worse if you had let one of his best friends get shot in the head,\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy hisses \n\nsomething\n\n in a hushed, strained tone, some sort of complaint about his phrasing, but Steve just smiles, chuckling once until he discovers that he\u2019s pretty sure forcing out another one might reopen the surgical stitches that crawl up his chest.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pair of them go quiet then, hovering over him like they\u2019re worried he might go into hysterics, or shock, or something, and then they seem to make some sort of unconscious decision. Because Nancy presses a kiss to the top of Steve\u2019s head, a rough, fleeting one, and Jonathan gently readjusts Steve\u2019s pillow so it\u2019s under him properly, not at the funny angle it had been in when they arrived, before leaving together.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve\u2019s not really sure how long they were there for, or how long it is before his next visitor arrives, because he closes his eyes for a little while, rousing to a nurse fiddling with one of the many tubes plugged into him.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s Lucas, next. Steve sort of gets the idea that they\u2019re sending them in small groups to avoid his fragile extremities collapsing from exposure, but as the boy sits on the end of his bed and helps him eat a hospital pudding, he also tells him that some of them are worse for wear.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRobin went into shock, sorta, when you died in the car,\u201d Lucas taps the handle of the spoon against the skin of Steve\u2019s forearm, who just listens quietly. \u201cJoyce had to call her parents. They took her home, but they said\u2014they said they\u2019d bring her here as soon as she was more. Y\u2019know?\u201d He makes a vague hand gesture in the way young teenage boys do.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d Steve tries not to feel like the world is crashing down on him. \u201cAnd, uh, Dustin\u2026?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nLucas gives him a grimace that says enough.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cCool. Cool cool cool.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nA sympathetic wince twitches onto the younger boy\u2019s face, and they drown a little in the uncomfortable silence for a few minutes, Steve entirely put off of the hospital pudding.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cUh, Steve?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHe lifts his head up to attention as best he can.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nLucas shifts. \u201cJust, y\u2019know. You said a lotta stuff when you were bleeding out on the pavement.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s his turn to grimace, then. \u201cJesus, if it was anything\u2014\n\nshitty, \n\njust, ignore it. I can\u2019t pretend I remember much of it, dude.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nShaking his head a little frantically, Lucas bites at his lip. \u201cNo, no, it wasn\u2019t, \n\nbad, \n\nlike, in the way you\u2019re thinking, you just. It sorta sounded like you were apologizing for all the shit Jason did, like\u2026 you had anything to do with that. It was totally out of your control, man, he was a raging psycho.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMouth a little dry, Steve offers a light shrug, too weak to do much more physically. \u201cI just shouldn't have let you, Erica and Max be in that house alone. Not when we knew Jason was on some witch-hunt.\u201d He swallows. \u201cBilly was bad enough. Jason did a fucking number on you, and I shoulda been there, or you shouldn\u2019t have been there. So yeah, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nLucas\u2019 eyebrows raise, pinching in a frustrated line down his forehead. \u201cWhen Max says your head is just a block of concrete, I usually defend your honor, Steve, but that\u2019s some stupid shit,\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNo, hey yourself,\u201d As if to prove a point, Lucas indignantly eats a spoonful of Steve\u2019s hospital pudding. \u201cYou know my parents still think of you as the golden boy of Hawkins, right? The hero who saved their son from big bad Billy?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve looks incredulous, doubt clouding his sickly-pale face.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI mean it, man, no joke,\u201d Lucas folds his arms. \u201cYou were my hero too, back then.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI \n\nlost\u2014\u201c\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou took a \n\nplate \n\nto the head. For \n\nme, \n\nSteve. I\u2019d never had someone do something like that for me before.\u201d Lucas clicks his tongue, and for a moment Steve sees where the Sinclair siblings share their authoritative attitude. \u201cSometimes me and Dustin would meet up just to talk about how cool you were, after it all happened. You got the worst beat down of your life for me, then still went into those stupid tunnels just cuz we were, and then you picked Dustin up and used yourself as a human shield against the demodogs, even when it looked like your face was ready to fall off.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s a pause where Lucas expectantly waits for Steve to argue, but finds himself pleased by the older boy\u2019s exhausted inability to do so.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cJason Carver is a total wack job, but he doesn\u2019t scare me half as much as Billy did. Plus, when he smashed a vase over my head? I was like, \n\nsick, \n\nnow I really feel just like Steve,\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHe smashed a \n\nvase \n\nover your head?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the point,\u201d Lucas scolds, though humor eats away at his expression. \u201cThe point is that if you keep trying to take ceramics to the head to protect me, I\u2019ll never learn how to protect myself, and you\u2019ll get, like, permanent brain damage.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSo stop beating yourself up. Other people do that to you enough,\u201d Lucas taps his arm with a light fist bump. \u201cOkay?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHeaving out a sigh, Steve feels the corners of his eyes crinkle fondly, shifting to give Lucas a proper fist bump. \u201cFine,\u201d Then a weak smile. \u201cStarting to feel like we need to leave the house with helmets these days though, just in case any stray pottery comes flying.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSleep came in and out in dregs again, a steady stream of nurses and doctors poking and prodding him, making sure he\u2019s still alive. Then Joyce returns with Will, whose eyes are slightly red rimmed, and doesn\u2019t have a whole lot to say. Which is okay. Steve got the feeling that he had a lot more talking to do later on\u2014and if he knew anything about Will, he knew the kid was tactile. Sensitive, too.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo he used the little strength in his arms to pull him in for a loose hug, ignoring the aches and groans of his gown-clad body for the sake of letting Will cry it all out into his shoulder, ignoring the weird feeling that came with the gentle, sad looks Joyce kept shooting Steve from across the room. He just lets him work it all through, because if Steve learnt anything from the way his dad raised him, not being allowed to cry it all out makes you a major, repressed douchebag in high school, and he\u2019d much rather suffer a wet patch on his shoulder then ever have to envision Will turning out the way \n\nKing Steve \n\nhad.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m not allowed to say sorry,\u201d Under strict instructions from Joyce, \u201cYou can pick the music in my car until your next birthday. That sound good?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd if the fearful chuckle was any indication, Steve thinks Will was pretty down for that idea. He left soon after, leaving Steve with Joyce for just a few more moments, who pressed a kiss to his forehead, and heart-wrenchingly made him promise to never die in her arms again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMike is delivered through the door next, Hopper practically tossing him inside, a firm hand wrangling the teenager by the shoulder.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMike has something to say to you,\u201d Comes the gruff insistence from the police chief, despite the clear displeasure of his fellow visitor.\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve shuffles in his bed a little, trying to get comfortable despite the clear \n\ndiscomfort \n\nof this situation, which only grows when Mike glowers at him with that typical Wheeler rage.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI wanted\u2014I wanted,\u201d He balls his fists at his side. \u201cTo say thank you. Even though you\u2019re fucking stupid, and you made everyone go totally batshit insane because you\u2019re an idiot with a goddamn death wish.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nIt looks like Hopper is seriously considering smacking him upside the head, but he contains the urge.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cListen, I think you\u2019re a jackass,\u201d Mike says, with his usual teenage boy charm. \u201cBut,\u201d He takes a breath. \u201cIf\u2014if you hadn\u2019t done what you did, El, would. El probably wouldn\u2019t have\u2014made it.\u201d Mike\u2019s chest heaves a little, and his eyes drop to the floor. \u201cSo thank you.\u201d And then he turns on his heel and storms out, slamming the door behind him.\n\n\n\n\n\nHopper settles his hands on his hips, one jutting out a little. \u201cThat kid\u2019s gonna be the death of me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve chuckles\u2014only to be met with a sharp glare. He gets the sense that he was set up, somehow, with that one.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOh no, Harrington, you don\u2019t get to laugh about that one. You died, back there. Your heart \n\nstopped.\u201d \n\nAnd then he stalks over, with all the swagger of a middle aged man in a mood, and drags the chair nearest the bed a little closer with an uncomfortable squeak of the legs on linoleum.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSorry, Hopper, Sir,\u201d Steve chokes out, bewildered.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nIf anything, that just makes him more pissed, because then suddenly Hopper points a finger at the thickest of Steve\u2019s bandages, right over where the first shot had hit him dead center in his chest. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to apologize,\u201d He swallows, shifting in his chair. \u201cThat bullet wound, there, right here?\u201d That finger hovers over the bandages, the man\u2019s brow creasing. \u201cThat\u2019s just about level with El\u2019s head. Almost exactly. If you\u2014if you hadn\u2019t,\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHopper sets a rough, large hand on Steve\u2019s shoulder, squeezing. \u201cHe would\u2019ve shot El straight in the head. Neutralized her in one shot. There\u2019s no coming back from a shot like that, Harrington. We would\u2019ve lost her forever,\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nVulnerability creeps its way onto Hopper\u2019s expression. He falters. \u201cI would\u2019ve lost her forever. So I don\u2019t want you to apologize,\u201d He stands, uncomfortable, voice thick with the threat of an emotional outburst. \u201cBut you can\u2019t scare the shit out of us like that again, Harrington\u2014Steve. You can\u2019t. Are we clear?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nNodding a little dopily, Steve is a dangerous mix of ashamed and proud in the wake of Hopper\u2019s confessions. \u201cYes\u2014yes. Clear.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nWatching as Hopper slaps his own thighs and prepares to awkwardly stalk from the room, Steve surprises himself, voice scratching from out his throat just before he\u2019s alone again. \u201cHopper?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah, kid?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPlease tell her it\u2019s not her fault. Slander me however you like, I just\u2014don\u2019t let that shit sit on her conscience.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHopper just smiles, and nods silently, watching the relief ease into Steve before taking a swift, calculated exit before any more underlying emotions are brought up to be discussed. (Because for the love of God, that is so not Jim\u2019s strong suit.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMax is a little harder. Because he\u2019s actually asleep this time, and waking up to find the girl studying him intently is a lot startling, Steve having to swallow down the urge to yelp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI was making sure you were breathing properly,\u201d She admits, eventually, when Steve\u2019s been silent for long enough. Max then cringes, and rolls her eyes. \u201cOnly because your brain can\u2019t afford to be starved of any more oxygen.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve coughs, wincing. \u201cThanks Max,\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThen they stew in silence for a while, both of them entirely aware of what\u2019s hanging between them, the elephant in the room. It\u2019s not just awkward, it\u2019s suffocating, and Steve fights to not break the silence, knowing that if he says the wrong thing in a conversation like this with Max, the topic will never be broached ever again.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not Billy,\u201d Steve has to force himself to not quip back a \n\nthank you\n\n to that, again.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nMax balls her fists. \u201cYou\u2019re not Billy, and I don\u2019t want you to be Billy. I\u2019ve never wanted you to be Billy.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve just blinks. \u201cOkay,\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cShut up,\u201d She takes a shaky breath. \u201cJust\u2014just listen, okay? You always think you know best but you don\u2019t, so be quiet and listen to me,\u201d As instructed, Steve nods slowly, albeit bewildered.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBilly was my brother. So\u2014so I\u2019m, like, obligated to care about him in a way. He was my brother, Steve. He had no choice. He was awful to me and my friends and \n\nyou, \n\nand then he died and it hurt me because he was my brother, and I couldn\u2019t choose for it not to hurt me if I tried,\u201d Max grips the railing of the bed, refusing to meet Steve\u2019s eyes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not Billy, because you\u2019re not my brother, but, mostly because you,\u201d A shaky intake of breath. \u201cYou\u2019ve chosen. You\u2019ve chosen to care about me, you had the choice and you \n\nchose, \n\nyou protected me when I was just some random girl to you, and you did\u2014you did and you acted in every way that I wanted \n\nBilly \n\nto act like, you acted like you were my brother and I hated you for it because Billy would never choose to do the same even with a goddamn gun to his head,\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nShe hugs herself, arms loosely gathering around her torso. \u201cAnd sometimes I speak to you and I wish you were my brother. I imagine that my mom met your dad, that they got married instead of\u2014instead of Billy\u2019s dad, I imagine that you cared about me from the start, looked after me, looked out for me,\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBut you aren\u2019t my brother, Billy was. And Billy died and I felt like the worst person in the world for wishing he wasn\u2019t my brother, for wishing that you were, but you haven\u2019t\u2014you haven\u2019t \n\ntaken \n\nhis place.\u201d Max rushes forwards all of a sudden, a fire burning in her eyes with such a ferocity Steve wonders how anyone could hear her speak and not be entirely captivated and a little afraid of the way she does so. \u201cYou two aren\u2019t\u2014comparable. But you still act like, how\u2014how I\u2019d want a brother of mine to act, to\u2026 to care.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMax furiously wipes away the threat of tears with the sleeve of a jacket she\u2019s borrowed off of Lucas, body shuddering under the weight of her words. \u201cSo if you\u2014if you ever fucking \n\ndare \n\npull shit like that again, Steve, I won\u2019t put up with it. If you die I\u2019ll go completely insane and it\u2019ll be your fault. So you can\u2019t. You can\u2019t do that to me, okay? It\u2019s not just Dustin who cares, Steve, you were dying and that\u2019s \n\nnot okay,\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPromptly bursting into tears, Max falls into the embrace Steve hesitantly offered as her words stumbled into sobs, though stunned, he forces his arms to curl around her, before eventually she clambers onto the bed and curls up in a ball against his chest, arms looped around his neck as full-body, guttural cries tear through her, soothed slowly by the constant rise and fall of Steve\u2019s breath.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nHe can\u2019t place exactly how long they stayed that way\u2014he only knew that they both fell asleep at some point, exhausted, drained\u2014Max pried away from him when it was later, Hopper gathering her in his arms to take back to his cabin for a much needed sleepover with Eleven.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve knows he slept most of the night, too, the good pain stuff finally sending him on his merry way, which is what he attributes to feeling someone casting a hand through his hair gently and speaking to him slowly, gently, because when he finally manages to open his eyes, there\u2019s nobody there.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Robin returns, though, it\u2019s four in the morning, and she definitely makes herself known. She chucks a large variety of different, brightly coloured sweet packets onto the bed, one of them directly at Steve\u2019s head, smacking him square in the face.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRob\u2014hey? Ow?\u201d Steve makes sleepy gestures to his wounds, rubbing sleep from his eyes.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the worst person I\u2019ve ever met and I hate you more than ginger beer,\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOk. I still don\u2019t get why you hate ginger beer, Rob, it\u2019s good,\u201d Steve blanks, watching Robin pace violently back and forth across the small space of his hospital room. \u201cWhat is all this stuff?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nRobin smacks her hands together, making Steve startle a little. \u201cI raided the vending machine with Eddie, he broke it and everything poured out. That\u2019s not the point,\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWait, Eddie\u2019s here?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOh my \n\ngod, \n\nSteve shut up!\u201d Steve shuts up. \u201cY\u2019know that time when we got stuck in that Russian paradise under the mall\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI mean, yeah, Rob, that\u2019s pretty hard to forget\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFor his troubles, Steve gets another walloping from a stray bag of sweets, stiff from being in the machine for god knows how long.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe got stuck in there, and you\u2014you did this thing, where you kept going first, kept stepping in front of everyone and I was like, gee, this guy is such a macho man, I bet he wants us to applaud his manly bravery, blehblah,\u201d Making wild hand gestures, Robin suddenly grips the railing of Steve\u2019s bed, shaking it back and forth a little. \u201cBut that\u2019s the thing! You weren\u2019t doing it because, like, you wanted to be manly or whatever, you just\u2014you do this thing, where you try and protect everyone like you\u2019re some human shield and it\u2019s so goddamn stupid!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve is too scared to speak for the sweet artillery, but he does offer Robin a dopey little facial expression. \u201cEven when actual, armed Russian soldiers with actual guns were trying to kill us, you made Dustin and Erica run away, and then you kept \n\ntalking, \n\nand I only recently realized that you kept talking cuz you knew I can\u2019t shut up unless someone else is speaking all the time. And you kept talking til you annoyed that freaky Russian guy and they dragged you away and they tortured you first because you wouldn\u2019t shut up, and I was sat at home thinking oh my God, that fucking weasel!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nRobin throws another sweet packet at him, despite his silence. \u201cYou weasel! You did it on purpose, made them take you first because you knew that Dustin would pull it off, you decided to stall them with your stupid face getting a stupid beat down! You kept speaking so they wouldn\u2019t choose \n\nme, \n\nand, and for like\u2014twenty minutes down there I thought you were dead.\u201d She swallows, thickly. \u201cThey strapped you against me in that chair and for twenty minutes I was so scared that they\u2019d just strapped your corpse to me because you wouldn\u2019t move or groan when I moved around and I couldn\u2019t feel you breathing!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even like you back then, not til it was all said and done and I realized that oh, Jesus, Steve Harrington is my favorite person in the whole world, how messed up is that? And then you were my best friend, and I love you so fucking much, I, like, don\u2019t think I could go a day without talking to you, Steve, it\u2019s like, being platonically obsessed with you,\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nRobin makes very little space for breathing in her rant, having to pause just to pant for a second or few. \u201cThen\u2014then Vecna happened, and we were out on Lover\u2019s Lake and you just started getting \n\nnaked \n\nand I was like \n\nshit, \n\nhe\u2019s doing it again! And I annoyed the fuck out of Nance asking her how long you\u2019d been down there every ten seconds because I was so scared, Steve, I was terrified you wouldn\u2019t come back up, that somehow Vecna would get you and you\u2019d drown before we realized,\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThen you came back up,\u201d Robin\u2019s hands are shaking uncontrollably, Steve notices. \u201cAnd I was so relieved. I was like, shit, he\u2019s put himself in the line of fire and hasn\u2019t\u2014been \n\nmaimed. \n\nAnd I think I cursed you because then you got pulled down and I was so horrified, Steve, not scared to go after you, scared\u2014scared I\u2019d be too late. And we almost were.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nShe leans forwards, tracing the scar that spans across his throat. \u201cAnd today we were too late. Steve, you \n\ndied. \n\nLike, you heart stopped, blue lips \n\ndied. \n\nEddie, he still\u2014he can\u2019t get all of your blood off his hands, and that\u2019s probably why he hasn\u2019t come to see you yet because I think he\u2019s gone through like. Six cigarettes and counting, and maybe he thinks this is karma, because I told him what you were like when \n\nhe \n\ndid this to us, but he\u2019s forgiven because it\u2019s the first strike for him\u2014this is strike what, for you Steve?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nRobin puts up her hands. \u201cLet\u2019s count. One, you went back inside the Byers\u2019 place and saved Nancy and Jonathan with a bat from an inter dimensional monster you knew \n\nnothing \n\nabout.\u201d She puts a finger up. \u201cTwo\u2014you went along with those stupid kids and almost got eaten by demodogs protecting them. Three\u2014you pushed yourself in the way of Max and those dogs when they almost got in the trailer,\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI think that should count as just one\u2014\u201d Steve gets hit in the face with a packet of Parma Violets.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cFour, you went to a showdown with Billy Hargrove, who\u2019d been looking to kick your ass since the school year began. Five, you stepped between him and Lucas and got beat so bad Hopper had to try and fight you to get you to come to the emergency room. Six, you followed those kids into those tunnels. Seven\u2014you picked Dustin up and prepared to get \n\neaten \n\nor \n\nshredded \n\nby those demodogs, and only didn\u2019t because of pure luck, Steve.\u201d Just for the look on his face, a Sherbet Fountain is launched his way. \u201cEight, you refused to let anyone but you touch that glowing green stuff in the Russian elevator.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nRobin takes another breath. \u201cNine, you got into a fight with an armed Russian. Ten, you held the door while Dustin and Erica got away. Eleven\u2014you got yourself tortured for \n\nme, \n\nand almost definitely nearly \n\ndied. \n\nTwelve\u2014you packed those kids into that car and you drove in your state. Thirteen, you turned \n\naround \n\nand drove back to help them even though it was almost certain death.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve tries to argue that Robin was with him for most of this, too, but falls silent when she raises a drumstick lolly in warning.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cFourteen, you totaled Billy Hargrove\u2019s car to save Nancy, Jonathan and the kids. Fifteen, you helped them fight that huge mega monster with fireworks.\u201d Robin stalks over to him, eyes blazing with earnest fondness. \u201cSixteen, you followed Dustin to Reefer Rick\u2019s house because you trust him, even though it sounded like Eddie was a murderer. Seventeen, you took a shard of glass to the neck for your troubles. Eighteen, you refused to leave Max alone even though Vecna could\u2019ve got you, any of us. Nineteen, you got half naked in that stupid boat on Lover\u2019s Lake and you dove down there. Twenty, you got dragged through the gate.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTwenty-one, those bats nearly fucking killed you. Twenty-two, you stayed in the Upside Down with Nance because Vecna got her, when you could\u2019ve left her there and been way safer. Twenty-three, you stole and drove a whole mobile home just because Eddie said it was the best move and we needed weapons. Twenty-four, you went into Vecna\u2019s lair first, twenty-five, you almost died just trying to cut me down from those vines. Twenty-six, you fought \n\nVecna \n\nafter all of your goddamn,\u201d She makes a hand gesture to his neck. \u201cNeck trauma. Twenty-seven, you refused to leave Eddie\u2019s body behind, and did CPR with your stupid lifeguard training in the Upside Down when any old monster could\u2019ve come and \n\nate \n\nyou.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTwenty-eight, you lugged him all the way to Hawkin\u2019s Lab before we even knew you were sick. Twenty-nine, those bat bites? They \n\ndid \n\nmake you sick.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nRobin points to his gun wounds. \u201cThirty. You got shot protecting El. Twice. And then you \n\ndied. \n\nFor real, \n\ndied. \n\nThat\u2019s thirty strikes Steve, not three strikes and you\u2019re out\u2014thirty! Do you realize how insane that is?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOkay, but some of those should definitely not count. Loads of the rest of you did them too,\u201d Robin hits Steve with a Skor Candy bar.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah. Sure, we did. But we don\u2019t already have a track record for stupid heroics, jackass!\u201d And then she shoves him, then drags him back up again, pulling him into a really, really tight hug. Despite the searing pain in his chest, he reciprocates, shoving his face into her shoulder and closing his eyes.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nShe wasn\u2019t wrong. Maybe they were a little codependent. His nose wrinkles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHey\u2014are you wearing my aftershave?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nRobin grins at him. \u201cYeah, rich boy Steve. I swung by yours, since, y\u2019know, you gave me a key and all\u2014picked you up some essentials. Like your hair products, dingus.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve lights up like a Christmas tree. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYour favorite person ever? The best? I know, Steve. And I love you. But if you get to strike thirty-one, don\u2019t be surprised if I give you strike thirty-two when I smack you so hard you fall into the Upside Down.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce firmly admonished by Robin (and then her parents, who still seem to think they\u2019re irrevocably in love) Steve, against the wishes and strict instructions of his doctors, dragged himself out of bed. With one hand holding the metal pole on wheels that attached the main machines and IV bags he was hooked to, Steve limped and wheeled his way through the quiet, artificially lit hospital corridors, searching.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf he knew Eddie, he\u2019d be here. Skulking about somewhere. There was no one else holding down the fort\u2014but no way would they leave Steve alone. Hopper was home with Eleven and Max, Will and Jonathan had gone back with Joyce, Nancy and Mike in tow, and Steve had no doubt that the Sinclairs and Hendersons were a merged family unit for the night. Robin had just been dragged back home.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThey wouldn\u2019t leave Steve alone, someone would be holding down the fort.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd there he was, just outside the hospital doors, smoking as the sunrise just began, the air warm and thick and quiet in the fifth hour of the morning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEddie?\u201d His voice is raw, and still a pain to try and use, especially as Steve tries to keep pushing on forwards on limbs that should probably not be in action right now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYes, Steve\u2014\n\nSteve?\u201d \n\nEddie whips around, cigarette falling from his fingers, abandoned on the floor as he stumbles over, taking Steve by the arms and balancing out some of his weight. \u201cWhat the fuck, man, Jesus Christ, you should \n\nnot \n\nbe out here!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah, Steve agrees, as his vision clouds a little from the pain. \u201cRobin said you were here.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBuckley is a meddlesome minx,\u201d Eddie scorns, looping his arms around Steve to take his weight. \u201cWe\u2019re going back to your room, now, before you keel over and die \n\nagain.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201c\n\nHey,\u201d Steve grumbles, though he follows Eddie\u2019s lead as they begin to trudge back through the hospital. \u201cYou can\u2019t be mad at me. You did this whole, thing, like\u2026 a couple months ago. You died on me \n\ntwice \n\nwhile I tried to give you CPR.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nEddie chuckles, dragging him round the corner. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, offended the Harrington kiss of life didn\u2019t wake me up, Prince Charming?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFeeling heat around his neck as Eddie jostled with the door handle, Steve resides to just roll his eyes. At the time, the CPR had been entirely practical, when all he was able to worry about was Eddie\u2019s life hanging in the balance, not the fact that technically he was mouth to mouth with another dude.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother dude, who he enjoyed looking at. Just a bit too much.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nBut this dude just helps him clamber back onto his bed, though he does falter for a second when Steve\u2019s gown saves little for the imagination\u2014Eddie suddenly finding the ceiling fascinating until Steve is safely sat down and much more modest.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201c\n\nFor your modesty, man,\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve wishes Eddie had another jacket to throw at him, or something, right about now.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nHe\u2019s snapped from his thoughts when Eddie takes a seat on the bed beside him, looking pained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve gotta stop making eyes like that at me man, it\u2019s not fair,\u201d Steve isn\u2019t really sure what that means, this is just his face\u2014and now that same face looks about ten times more confused. \u201cYes, that face, \n\nSteven\n\n, that face,\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve grimaces at the use of his full name. \u201cSorry, dad, when did you get here?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nA grin sparks its way onto Eddie\u2019s face, ruffling Steve\u2019s hair. \u201cSorry, Stevie. You like that better?\u201d His voice is tender, entirely too soft for it to come out of Eddie \u2018The Freak\u2019 Munson, yet it does, gently making the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah. That\u2019s better,\u201d Steve looks up at him, mellow and maybe a little smitten, when Eddie suddenly smacks his arm. \u201cOw,\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThose eyes! Stop making those eyes at me, man, normal people don\u2019t make eyes like that at their very male, very \n\nnot\n\n Nancy Wheeler, \n\nfriends\n\n, Stevie!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce again, Steve is just completely lost. \u201cI thought we \n\nwere\n\n friends?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stare Eddie gives him is nothing short of utter disbelief. \u201cY\u2019know, when Max said you had a concrete block for a brain, I defended you, man. You\u2019re not helping your case.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy do people keep saying that?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother incredulous look from Eddie. \u201cYou wanna disagree with Max Mayfield\u2019s authority, Stevie?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah, no, fair point,\u201d Steve lies back down on his bed, staring over at Eddie from where the other boy still sits upright, one of his eyebrows raised up to his bangs.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThey stay like that for a minute or two, maybe even a second longer\u2014before Eddie finally breaks their stasis, shifting until he\u2019s lying beside Steve in the hospital bed, clunky boots hovering just a little above the cool white sheets.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nWith another little pause for awkwardness to subside, Steve eventually throws caution entirely to the wind\u2014and wriggles down a bit until his head is level with Eddie\u2019s chest, and cushions it there. He can feel the way Eddie withholds his breath for a moment, as if he\u2019s scared that exhaling too heavily will hurt Steve, or scare him away. Ringed fingers creep up his bandaged side in feather-light touches until it flays out across his back like a happy starfish. He feels the light traces of Eddie\u2019s fingertips drawing patterns into the skin of his back, touching the flesh exposed by the gaps in his hospital gown.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s tender. It sets Steve alight, again, but not with pain\u2014a sense of need, or the warmth of such a gentle touch from someone so rough around the edges. Eddie smells of cigarette smoke, and vending machine chocolate.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDo you think he\u2019ll, like, come around?\u201d Comes a tentative whisper, Steve gently shifting so their legs can tangle together over the bedsheets. There\u2019s not really enough space for the two of them to lie comfortably, separately\u2014so he makes sure every bit of him has contact with Eddie someplace, somehow.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMmh? D\u2019you mean Dustin?\u201d Eddie drags his nails up the space between Steve\u2019s shoulder blades, chuckling when it makes him shudder pleasantly. \u201cHe\u2019s gonna stay mad for ages. But he\u2019ll come and see you soon. I\u2019ve been tryna wrangle him here, but you know what he\u2019s like. Stubborn as a Minotaur, that kid,\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve isn\u2019t really sure what a Minotaur is, but Eddie\u2019s arm is curled around his waist and he\u2019s wound their legs together properly, not in the loose, cowardly way Steve had initiated before. So he doesn\u2019t really mind.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nFingers finding a lock of Eddie\u2019s hair, Steve absentmindedly twirls it around his index finger, taking more of it to play with when he finds doing so appeals to him. \u201cHe loves you, that kid does. You\u2019re like his\u2026 deity \n\nslash\n\n dad. You practically broke his heart in that stupid truck earlier,\u201d Falling silent when Steve tugs at one of his messy curls with a tiny bit more force than he had the others, Eddie shuffles a little, readjusting himself. \u201cUh, y\u2019know\u2014you remember what you were saying, right?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSearching for anything he could recall from the car ride, Steve gives a noncommittal shrug. Eddie presses on. \u201cYou got real scary in the end, Stevie. Started talking about how you had to get Dustin home to Mrs Henderson, then you flailed around real crazy like saying you\u2019d lost \n\nyour\n\n kid,\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve cringes, burying his face in Eddie\u2019s chest. He feels the echo of another chuckle between Eddie\u2019s ribs. \u201cYou know what it\u2019s like. With his dad,\u201d Going very, very still when Eddie\u2019s hand settles in the hair at the nape of his neck, Steve tries his best to keep breathing when Eddie begins to lightly fiddle with the softer locks of hair there, the gentler wisps untouched by his various products. \u201cYou pretty much gave him everything he\u2019s ever wanted, and then took it away again,\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re Steve Harrington the Hero, to those kids. But you can\u2019t keep doing shit like that man. Today, it\u2019s like\u2026\u201d Eddie rests his face on the top of Steve\u2019s head, breathing him in. \u201cIt really showed everyone that you\u2019re our glue, dude. You hold the party together, you\u2019re like\u2026 our moron leader with a thick head of cement and a serious death wish.\u201d When Steve tries to speak up to protest, Eddie scoffs, and presses his head back down into his chest. Steve doesn\u2019t complain.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEveryone fell apart when the doctors were tryna revive your shit, Stevie. There was a second where they weren\u2019t sure they could. And we all stood there in, like\u2026 \n\nhysterics\n\n, hating ourselves for not doing this that or some fucking other.\u201d Eddie drags his fingers through Steve\u2019s hair from the roots to the top of his head, sending ripples of warmth to trickle up his spine. \u201cWe almost lost you. \n\nAgain\n\n.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nEddie presses his cheek against the top of Steve\u2019s mop of finger-tousled hair, and closes his eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t lose you. We\u2014we can\u2019t. The Party needs you.\u201d Though he doesn\u2019t say it, Steve can hear the \n\nI need you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe shifts, again, moving until he\u2019s lying on Eddie almost entirely, lifting his chin up until they\u2019re practically nose-to-nose, eyes tracing every line of the boy\u2019s face. Steve studies him, admiring every twitch, every jitter, the gleam of his dark eyes and the length of his eyelashes. Marks every breath he takes. Watches those eyelashes bat bashfully, watches Eddie mark him with that look again. The reluctant fondness.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t look at me like that, Stevie.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAn exhale. \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nEddie inhales. \u201cYou know why. It\u2019s not fair.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat,\u201d Steve shifts one of his aching hands until it splays out across the side of Eddie\u2019s neck, fingertips brushing the line of his jaw. \u201cIsn\u2019t fair?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAs he swallows, Steve watches Eddie\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple bob, hesitant, a little uncertain. \u201cThis is dangerous territory, Stevie. Friends don\u2019t\u2014do stuff like this. Not with \n\nme\n\n,\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nEddie looks pained. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky you\u2019re hurt, Stevie, otherwise I really wouldn\u2019t spell it out for you.\u201d He swallows, again, and inhales, as if his body is preparing for fight or flight, here, cuddled up in Steve\u2019s hospital bed. \u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t exactly seek the company, of, uh. \n\nMaidens\n\n.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve looks blank. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cJesus Christ. Okay.\u201d Dragging a hand down his face, Eddie flushes, face warm. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014want to go steady with any old girl, Stevie. In fact\u2014\n\nno\n\n. No girl at all, ever.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother blink. \u201cSo you\u2019re celibate?\u2014\n\nwait\n\n. Oh. \n\nOh\n\n, no, I get it\u2014\n\nsorry\n\n.\u201d Steve turns an entirely different colour, blood rushing to his face so fast it\u2019s a wonder he doesn\u2019t pass out again. \u201c\n\nShit\n\n, sorry that was a stupid thing to say, the celibate thing, it was just cuz Robin was talking about how some, magazine she saw was talking about how \n\ncelibacy\n\n, is like, the \n\nnew\n\n sex, or some stupid shit, it was just rattling around in my head, y\u2019know, \n\ncement\n\n\u2014\u201c\n\n\n\n\n\nEddie seized his face in both of his hands, the cool metal of his rings pleasant for the heat in Steve\u2019s cheeks. Then he takes a deep breath, and furrows his brow. \u201cYou are so fucking stupid. You\u2019re lucky I like you so much.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd Steve can\u2019t protest, not at all, because then Eddie pulls him forwards, one hand keeping hold of his chin while the other finds the nape of his neck again, angling himself so when their lips crash together in a clumsy, pleasant conclusion, Steve finds no desire to protest ever again. In fact, he can\u2019t think of much past Eddie, and Eddie\u2019s hands, where they now sit on his back then his neck and journey back and forth between them, careful to shift around the worst of his injuries.\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve, on the other hand, abandons all worries of caution, and practically clambers into Eddie\u2019s lap, straddling him, keening when Eddie presses a kiss into the corner of his mouth, then his chin, then scatters them across his jawline, leaving a trail of light red marks that Steve knows will be proudly bruised the next day, baring his throat to him.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nHe\u2019s too tired, too high on the opportunity he was given to live again to even consider that this is so new, so strange\u2014Steve Harrington, ladykiller, serial dater and known Casanova is making out with Eddie \u2018The Freak\u2019 Munson while he sits in his lap in a hospital bed, of all places, having just asked if he was celibate, not gay, and discovering that Eddie is definitely one of those things, and the other is looking rapidly unlikely in the wake of Eddie\u2019s hands sliding under Steve\u2019s hospital gown.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve follows his lead until he\u2019s flat on his back, hand searing into the side of Eddie\u2019s face as he fists another in his long, soft hair and drags him down with him, ignoring the dull ache of his wounds for the blazing glory of this, ignoring the protesting creaks of Hawkin Hospital\u2019s low budget bed\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nBut they can\u2019t really ignore Steve\u2019s hospital room door suddenly swinging open hard enough to collide with the already-scuffed wall beside it, nor can they ignore Dustin, Dustin Henderson\u2014standing there, dumbstruck, holding a slightly wilted bouquet of Get Well Soon flowers.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nDustin shrieks. Eddie screams. Steve just lies there on his bed like a dead starfish.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, suddenly, he\u2019s alone in his hospital room again. Eddie vaulted off the bed and left him high and dry, likely to find somewhere private enough to adjust those skinny jeans that really did him no favors in times like this. (In other times? Steve thinks those jeans do him lots of favors.)\n\n\n\n\n\nDustin fled, though for just the stretch of the corridor, because by the time Steve has dragged under his bedsheets again, he\u2019s returned, still gobsmacked, mouth hanging open in the doorway.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDustin\u2014\u201c\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSteve. Steve!\u201d And then he\u2019s clambering onto Steve\u2019s bed, whacking him with the bouquet of flowers that no doubt Mrs Henderson insisted he take with him.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOw, Dustin,\u201d Steve groans, before seizing the attacking flowers, wiggling them out of the boy\u2019s grip.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a jackass! Is this why you wouldn\u2019t date Robin even though she\u2019s perfect?\u201d Steve grimaces, not entirely sure what he\u2019s being asked there. \u201cYou\u2019re such an asshole! Why did you waste my time while I tried to set you up with Robin when if you told me about Eddie I could\u2019ve had you guys married by now!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFlushing, Steve drags a hand down his face, then pops it on Dustin\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014a new thing. Let\u2019s not.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about? You\u2019ve got to go after him Steve!!! Don\u2019t let him slip away!!\u201d Though he definitely missed Dustin\u2019s enthusiasm, Steve\u2019s gunshot wounds were already greatly displeased by his decision to tussle with Eddie just then, now complaining about Dustin shaking him back and forth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDustin\u2014Dustin no. I really don\u2019t. He\u2019s gonna come back, he just\u2026\u201d Steve swallows. \u201cNeeds a second. Besides, I told him you and me need to talk.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe kid falls quiet then, staring at him with those big eyes, owlishly. Steve swallows his guilt. \u201cUh. So\u2014I just. I wanted to say\u2014\u201c He\u2019s cut off when Dustin suddenly throws his arms around him, arms looped around his neck as he topples them both over, squeezing the air out of Steve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t do that again,\u201d He whispers, mumbling into Steve\u2019s ear, and completely obliterates the mature conversation set up he had in mind as he feels his stomach drop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t apologize for doing it,\u201d Steve ruffles Dustin\u2019s hair, faintly fond as he smells the hair products he uses in the kid\u2019s mop, too. \u201cBut I am sorry for screwing you up like that, kid. It\u2019s not fair on you. What kinda heroes are me and Eddie if we keep putting you in total hysterics, right?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nDustin screws up his face. \u201cYou\u2019re my heroes\u2014the Party\u2019s heroes. But you\u2019re also a huge dickhead. Being a hero doesn\u2019t mean you have to keep dying,\u201d He takes a deep breath. \u201cSometimes the most heroic thing to do is stay alive,\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve sits back, a little stunned. \u201cJeez, how long you been stewing over that one?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSince I got home,\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah, I can tell.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSilence blankets the two of them, save for the steady beeping of whatever machine Steve is still hooked to\u2014and he gives Dustin a squeeze, again. A reminder he\u2019s still there.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care that you\u2019re gay, Steve,\u201d Dustin suddenly says, valiantly.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nBlinking, Steve flicks the back of Dustin\u2019s head. \u201cI\u2019m not gay. I like girls,\u201d Sensing the protest about to spit out of Dustin like venom, Steve instinctively shushes him. \u201cI like girls, and I also like Eddie. I also got shot to death, like, a few hours ago, cut me some slack on the self discovery journey here, Dustin.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re like David Bowie,\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve just pats his head. \u201cSure, whatever that means.\u201d He finds that better than questioning him\u2014because eventually Dustin gets comfortable, even if Steve isn\u2019t entirely in a wound-friendly position as he holds him, the younger boy knocking out. Sleeping soundly in a gaggle of limbs on his bed.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the time Eddie returns, Steve\u2019s eyes are almost too heavy to stay open\u2014but he lifts his hand off of Dustin\u2019s back to beckon him back over, shuffling the two of them a little to the right to offer the pretense of space. They both know that there isn\u2019t any\u2014but Eddie squeezes in anyway, spooning Steve while Dustin continues to toss and turn in the disastrous way he always has done.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen they wake up, it\u2019s in a tangle of limbs and Steve grumbling about pain, the bemused doctor who came to give him his morning meds just fixing him a look that says all. Dustin scarps down most of his hospital breakfast, Eddie scavenging the leftover bits Dustin doesn\u2019t like, the mushrooms, the beans\u2014while Steve just stares at them both.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nHe sips his orange juice, trying his best to be pissed off, but as Eddie starts to wrestle Dustin for the last piece of toast on the plate, all he can really muster is irrevocably fond.\n"
