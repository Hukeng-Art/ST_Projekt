I tried to keep it true to word but it\u2019s a bit of a read.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been a fan of Yuuri since his \u201cunknown\u201d days, since I have the fortune of sharing the same hometown as him. (Yes, I\u2019ve seen him skate in person. Last time, I was in middle school and just before he left for America.) I\u2019m not an expert in him or anything, but I may be at an advantage here at knowing some things most people aren\u2019t privy too. It\u2019s nothing too explicit, just things that are common knowledge here, so don\u2019t go ragging on me for sharing lol. Because I want to give my thoughts on possibly why Yuuri\u2019s performance in the Grand Prix was as abysmal as it was. Not as an excuse, but as a reason.\nTwo important things to know are:\n\u201c\nGot your attention?

It\u2019s not all about him, you know. Besides, we all know as soon as Katsuki doesn\u2019t qualify for the final then Victor is going to drop him like a hot potato. Which I\u2019m looking forward to because then Victor can come back and skate on the ice again. He belongs in the rink, not on the side of it.\nAnd don\u2019t even get me started with the shipping.

A lot of Victor and even Yuri Plisetsky fans have been really aggressive and hostile towards Yuuri Katsuki fans and ALL of you need to STOP.  Katsuki won the Hot Springs on Ice showdown fair and square (  a figure skating expert can even tell you why  ), Katsuki isn\u2019t taking Victor away from the sport (and is in fact, showing us all  a new side of him  ), and more importantly,  they\u2019re all friends .\nIf anything, just imagine how disappointed Victor would be if he found out you guys were acting this way.

Though I was blessed with support, I couldn\u2019t take full advantage over it. I always felt like I was fighting alone. \n\n\n But since Victor showed up to be my coach, I\u2019ve seen something totally different. My \u2018love\u2019 is not something clear-cut like romantic love, but the more abstract feeling of my relationships with Victor, my family, and my hometown. I was finally able to realize that something like love exists all around me. \n\n\n Victor is the first person I\u2019ve ever wanted to hold on to. I don\u2019t really have a name for that emotion, but I\u2019ve decided to call it \u2018love.\u2019 \n\n\n Now that I know what love is and am stronger for it, I\u2019ll prove it to myself with a Grand Prix Final gold medal!\u201d \n\n\u00a0\nTHIS ENTIRE THING STRENGTHENS ME\n\u00a0\n---\n[Page 1 of 5]\n[&lt;&lt; 1 2 3 4 5 &gt;&gt;]\n\u00a0\n(Anonymous)\nI WILL GO DOWN WITH THIS SHIIIIP\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (Anonymous)\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 AND I WONT PUT MY HANDS UP AND SURRENDER\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (Anonymous)\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 THERE WILL BE NO WHITE FLAG ABOVE MY DOOR\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (Anonymous)\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 VICTUURI IS IN LOVE AND ALWAYS WILL BE\n(rathofgrapes)\nholy shit if that\u2019s not a love declaration idek anymore man\n(zenseis)\nholyyyy shiiiiittttt omg\n(pork-bowling)\ncan confirm, \u00a0 japanese fandom also losing their shit about it \n(Anonymous)\nBBY IS ALL GROWN UP\n(Anonymous)\nngl at first i was skeptical about all this victor/yuuri shipping going around but now i can totally see it\npls send help\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (katsudone)\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 sorry bro no help here\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 just let it happen\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 shhh\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nthree-spins-up reblogged nikifaverov\n\n\u00a0\nThe Theory of Victor Nikiforov\u2019s Forehead\n\u00a0\n[ image ][ image ]\n[ image ][ image ]\n[ image ][ image ]\n[ image ][ image ]\n\nborntobehistory\n\nno listen to me\ntheory #3928309 on why victor is possibly leaving figure skating: he\u2019s balding\n\u00a0\n---\n\ndavaidavai\n\ncursed post\n---\n\nnikifaverov\n\ni hate and love this website and this post aklsjflkg\n\u00a0\nSource: borntobehistory \u00a0#lmao oh my fucking god #victor nikiforov #burn this post\n1,257 notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nphichit+chu\n\n[ image ]\n1,291 likes\nphichit+chu \u00a0look who I ran into at dinner! #Beijing #VictorNikiforov #YuuriKatsuki\n\u00a0\nkite-likes \u00a0hot pot!! that looks really good!\nlostdonut \u00a0TAKE LOTS OF PICS PLS\nmordynka \u00a0good luck at the competition!\n\u00a0\n\nphichit+chu\n\n[ image ]\n412 likes\nphicit+chu coach, hold on!!

(self.katsuyuudon)\nsubmitted 4 hours ago by demigodsays\n\u00a0\nSo we all were shocked and surprised when Victor jumped at Yuuri after his free skate program and I know a lot of people have been rooting for them, and the immediate assumption is that they kissed. And don\u2019t get me wrong, I hope that\u2019s the case but a lot of people are saying otherwise? So now that the flailing and shock is gone by now\u2026 Did we really see a kiss?\nNone of the TV cameras were able to get a good angle so we\u2019re left wondering. (Proof: video compilation of all the angles taken, but none of them show anything because Victor\u2019S DAMN ARM) Also, it looked like they shared words after, but again, no one knows what they said for sure.\nWhat\u2019s the consensus folks?

No surprise. A male-male coach-skater pair, however? A little eyebrow raising. Usually we like to stick to two people who compete together in the court, field, rink, or wherever, but we\u2019re bending the rules a little for Yuuri and Victor.\nThe figure skating community experienced a more than mild uproar when Russian living legend figure skater Victor Nikiforov announced taking the season off earlier this year. And when it was found out that he was coaching 2015 Grand Prix Final\u2019s 6th placer Yuuri Katsuki in the meantime, well, didn\u2019t that cause a lot of tongues to waggle.\nBut over the course of the year, the pair\u2019s chemistry became more and more undeniable. From Victor\u2019s constant instagram and twitter posts, to little moments captured on camera (more rink-side hugs than any other figure skating pair this year -- we counted), to Yuuri constantly seducing Victor with his \u201cOn Love: Eros\u201d routine -- it was no wonder people (all of us) were starting to think their relationship was more than platonic.\nAnd we were all proven right during the Cup of China, when the viral so-called \u201cVictuuri Kiss\u201d happened.\n\u00a0\n[ image ]\n(Sweet, sweet  victory  victuuri)\nTrust me, we all screamed when it happened, too.\n\u00a0\n\u2026\n\u00a0\n\nFacebook Conversations\n\nSort by: Top\n\u00a0\n\nKaterina Johnson\n\nSMH Yuuri and Victor should\u2019ve been #1\nLike.

I would like to apologize beforehand if it\u2019s not easy to understand, as English is not my first language and I\u2019m possibly ranting a little bit.\nLast year, a lot of people criticized Yuuri Katsuki for getting the pressure get to him at his (first!) GPF. Today, I\u2019m seeing a lot of the same regarding JJ Leroy\u2019s short program performance.\nIf you didn\u2019t watch today\u2019s performances, JJ is currently in last place at a personal low of 86.71 points after flubbing most of his jumps in his short program. From what we can glean, it seems like he possibly had an anxiety attack early on his program that affected the rest of his performance. To give him credit, it did look like he tried to snap out of it, but as all of us that have experienced it before know, most of the time it\u2019s not that easy.\nI skate competitively in local competitions. I know a lot of skaters. For many of us, the nerves never really go away and the best we can do is skate our way through it. Feeling nervous is natural and nothing to be ashamed of, and nothing to be shamed by. Because imagine this:\nYou\u2019re the top skater of your country. You\u2019re the best your country has to offer. That\u2019s why you\u2019ve been selected to represent your country.\nYour family, friends, and fans - they want and expect you to do your best. They mean well, but the expectations of those you know almost always weigh heavier than of strangers\u2019.\nYou\u2019re in the Grand Prix, and in the Final at that, where only the best of the best can compete in. You\u2019re expected to do your personal bests and make your country proud by performing as perfectly as you can.\nSometimes, something has to give.\nThe pressure of professional sports is hard to comprehend if you haven\u2019t experienced it. So I would just like to remind everyone to take consideration of what the athletes are experiencing before you criticize or explicitly vocalize your \u201cdisappointment\u201d (which to what I have seen, is borderline bashing sometimes).\n---\n\nnikifaverov\n\nYour English is fine! I understand how hard it is to express yourself in a secondary language, but I was able to get the gist of it, even as an ESL myself.\nThank you very much for your post though. I hope people take note of it and tone down with the extreme criticism.\n---\n\nunderstatedgarments\n\nI kinda wish this was around last year, but better late than never.\nBut yeah, I\u2019m getting uncomfortable flashbacks to the Yuuri Katsuki hate train last year so I\u2019m glad this is being pointed out. People forget that for some professional sports, it\u2019s not only about physical well-being, but also mental well-being as well. \nSource: sunnyskates #good post #figure skating\n32,091 notes \n\u00a0\n[Grand Prix Final 2016]SP is over, ranking predictions?

He also has a big lead over everyone else after his SP (new WR wtf). If he nails it perfectly like he did his SP, then he\u2019s guaranteed gold.\nGiacometti has a reputation of catching up very well in his FS. He\u2019s been constantly second to Victor for the past few competitions they\u2019ve both been in, and if it weren\u2019t for that 16 point difference between him and Plisetsky, I\u2019d would\u2019ve said he\u2019d take gold.\nNow, Altin is a dark horse but he did get bronze at the last World\u2019s, and he\u2019s currently second place, so it\u2019s an ideal place for him to be at for him to stand on the podium. But, Katsuki\u2019s FS this year is strong PCS and TES wise, so if he nails all his program components - especially the quad flip at the end of his program - then he has a real shot of making up all the points he lost in the SP and at least getting bronze.\nOn Chulanont and Leroy: Chulanont, despite winning gold at the Cup of China, I don\u2019t think can match up the other programs especially since he\u2019s comparatively weaker with his quads. His score is heavily dependent on his PCS. I think he shines when he\u2019s more focused on performing and entertaining the crowd, which won him China in the first place.\nNow Leroy. Oh JJ. His SP was a mess. He did evidently try to recover, but his score suffered poorly by his messed up jumps. Depending on how his FS goes, he maaaaaaay recover and grab fifth or even fourth if someone else messes up worse.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYuuri Katsuki Fan Club (katsuki_fc) wrote\n@  2016  -  12  -  xx  \u00a0  08:39 am \nEntry tags: + grand prix 2016  +  watch party \n\u00a0\n Grand Prix 2016 Watch Party DAY TWO  \nToday is the free program and they\u2019ll be skating according to the short program rankings from lowest to highest score!\nSkate order is as follows:\nRules:\nand most importantly,\n---\n[Page 4 of 137]\n[&lt;&lt; 1 2 3 4 \u2026135 136 137 &gt;&gt;]\n\u00a0\n(Anonymous)\ni\u2019m not a big fan of jj but i\u2019m rooting for him today\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (Anonymous)\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Same.

SO SO CLOSE. Both Yu(u)ri\u2019s broke Victor\u2019s world records and rumor has it that Victor is making a comeback soon. (I find it a little funny, because Victor choreographed both the programs that beat him lol) And JJ also made an incredible recovery and managed to get bronze.\nThis has been a wild ride. And the season isn\u2019t even over yet! There\u2019s still the respective country\u2019s Nationals, Four Continents, European Championships, and then World\u2019s!

Get a little sentimental here.\nBecause this time last year we were a little less than 100 members, and only 20 pages in comments for the entire weekend. In comparison to the other grand prix finalists last year, the collective Yuuri Katsuki non-Japanese fandom was a respectable size, but not comparable to the other skaters.\nAnd look where we are now.\n3,501 members (a lot of you still lurkin\u2019 anons, but I see youuu) and that\u2019s just in this site, which let\u2019s be real, is a dying platform. The /r/katsyuudon subreddit 11,081 subscribers as I type this, and it\u2019s growing each day. Our Tumblr counterpart yuurikatsuki-fc has 41,928 followers. And let\u2019s not forget our fellow fans in Japan - their top Yuuri fansite/forum boasts a fantastic 398,923 followers.\nWe\u2019ve grown as a fandom together with Yuuri this past year, and it gives me FEELS to see how far we\u2019ve gone. I\u2019ve been an unapologetic Yuuri fan since the beginning, and every time I watch and support him through his low and high points with everyone, I feel like will never be anything else otherwise.\nI am so so proud of everyone, and especially of Yuuri. He suffered harsh criticism and people telling him to retire early on this year, but he turned it all around to better himself and started being more open about his struggles with anxiety, showing us a whole new side of him. This season has been a new starting point for both the fandom and Yuuri (and Victor, let\u2019s not forget the man who encouraged the possibility), and I\u2019m crying. Legit tears.\nWhatever happens for the rest of the season, remember how far our favorite skater has gotten, and let\u2019s keep cheering Yuuri-chan on.\nThank you, Yuuri, and keep doing your best!\nEDIT: Sort of related, but a  \u201cThank You, Yuuri\u201d Project  is being started by the tumblr fc, prompted by  this really moving open letter from a young amateur skater. Please check it out and consider participating. Our boy needs constant reminders that he\u2019s very much appreciated and admired as a skater and a person.\n---\n[Page 1 of 29]\n[&lt;&lt; 1 2 3 4 5 \u2026 29 &gt;&gt;]\n\u00a0\n(Anonymous)\nMOD-SAN ;A;\nMOD-SAN WE LOVE YOU\n(Anonymous)\noh god now i have ALL THE FEELS ;-;\n(katsudone)\nThank you for everything, mod-san &lt;3\n(demiguises)\nmod-san, you\u2019ll always be #1 yuuri fan in our hearts ((u can fite me, minami kenjirou))\n(Anonymous)\nI\u2019m so glad for all of you.
