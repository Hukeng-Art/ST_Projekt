The tags have been added and if you'd like more detail about the warning please see the end notes of this chapter.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_7_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoyed, I was extra nervous about this chapter ;;</p>\n<p>Comments and kudos appreciated.</p>\n<p>Edit: Additional Warnings - Dubious Consent !!Spoilers!!<br>This warning will apply to this chapter and to some future chapters. I initially didn't add it because I didn't think it applied but upon further thought (inspired by reviews) I have decided better safe then sorry. The situation is, basically, Draco doesn't at this time feel like he has a choice when it comes to sex, both of them are horrid communicators in this fic and (like Ron worried) Harry has no experience with dealing with this kind of trauma and hasn't realized that Draco feels that way. So that's where the dubious part comes in.</p>\n<p>The good news is: if Draco realized the situation for what it is and wasn't currently in denial about what he wants, he would have (non-dubiously) agreed to it. I promise eventually they start communicating more effectively, but as a heads up it does take them a rather long time.</p>\n<p>Thanks for continuing with this story! Hope you enjoy.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_8_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading! comments and kudos appreciated.</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading, Hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_9_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>So i know that generally the black family tree shows birth and death dates but for the sake of this au and to further angst it doesnt, just to clarify how Draco didn't know his parents were alive till Harry said he'd been writing to them. </p>\n<p>Hope you enjoyed~ Thanks for reading.</p>\n<p>Thanks for all the responses to the last chapter, it's so appreciated!</p>\n<p>There are some schedule notes in the end note so please be sure to check that out.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_11_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading, hope you enjoyed!</p>\n<p>As a heads up I may not post any new chapters for the next two weeks. I meant to warn last chapter but I forgot, sorry. I'm getting married and while I should have internet access, and I might update, it's definitely not going to be a priority for me. I'll be back to my regular schedule in June though so, hope to see you all then.</p>\n<p>Thank you all for all the well wishes! They were all so nice to read. &lt;3&lt;3 <br>I'm a married man now, so back to writing/posting fic. I don't believe there will be any more interruptions to posting this fic but I will try and let yall know if that changes. </p>\n<p>Thank you for reading, I hope you enjoy.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_12_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>I'm sorry? I always hate leaving chapters on a down note but sometimes you just gotta.</p>\n<p>We still have a ways to go before this fic is over, and I hope that you all continue to enjoy. Comments and kudos appreciated.</p>\n<p>Hello again everyone, thanks for sticking with this fic and i hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_13_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>This chapter is the longest one in the whole fic if i recall correctly.

I hope you continue to enjoy.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_14_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Fun fact: this is version 2 of this fic, and the folder it's in is still called the \"I'm Horny Version\" bc this version has a least 200% more sex. Still not as much sex as it could be, but a lot more than unpublished version 1. </p>\n<p>Thanks for reading, I hope you enjoyed. Have a wonderful day!</p>\n<p>Thank you for your continued support. &lt;3</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_15_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading, I hope you enjoyed!</p>\n<p>Comments &amp; Kudos appreciated.</p>\n<p>Sorry this update is a bit later in the day, hope you enjoy anyway!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_16_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>So I vaguely recall something about how when something comes in contact with fiendfyre it is immediately consumed by it but I dont remember if that was a canon thing or just something I read in a fic but for the sake of this fic that isn't the case. </p>\n<p>Thanks for reading, I hope you enjoyed. Comments &amp; kudos appreciated.</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading, hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_17_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>This chapter was actually a late addition, because Teddy making an appearance was such a popular request and because I felt the story needed a bit of breathing room between the previous chapter and the one that is coming next.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoyed! Comments and kudos appreciated.</p>\n<p>Hello! Thank you for reading, I'm so glad you've made it this far.</p>\n<p>As a heads up I wont be posting the week of August 2nd, as I have family visiting and I'll be far too busy cleaning that week in preparation to be able to give that chapter the editing focus it deserves.

If you're interested in more please feel free to let me know in comments or on twitter. I'm not sure when I'll feel up for it but I wouldn't be opposed to adding more scenes if theres anything you wanted to see, and I'm also always open to new fic ideas.</p>\n<p> I currently have a bonus chapter planned to celebrate that we reached a kudos milestone, but I don't yet know when I'll be able to get that finished so its up to you if you want to keep this fic bookmarked for that. </p>\n<p>Thank you so much for reading and I really hope you enjoyed, comments and kudos so appreciated.</p>\n<p>We reached a kudos goal a while back so here's a soft little Christmas themed bonus chapter. Hope you enjoy~</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_24_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Might do a few more of these maybe, I have a few other ideas.</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoyed. Comments and kudos always appreciated.</p>\n<p>(also if you have name suggestions for baby #2 that'd be cool, otherwise i might just go back and choose another from the ones people already gave.)</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been a long time! But I finally got around to finishing another bonus chapter. Also, this fic got a spanish translation! I\u2019m so excited and thankful. It\u2019s thanks to that that I found the motivation to finish this bonus chapter. <br>Thanks to the hard work of <a rel=\"nofollow\">Dragonlytherin</a>, a spanish translation can now be found <a rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. <br>Also sorry in advance to any Jeremy\u2019s out there. I just chose a random name.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_25_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been like\u2026 almost two years (I think?) since I\u2019ve written anything for this fic so I felt kinda rusty, hopefully it's not too different from the rest.</p>\n<p>I didn't find a chance to fit much of Cyrus into this chapter but I imagined that Delilah got Harry\u2019s hair and Draco\u2019s eyes and that Cyrus is the opposite and got Draco\u2019s hair and Harry\u2019s eyes.</p>\n<p>Thank you everyone for the continued support. I don\u2019t currently have anything else planned for this fic but I do have a few other Drarry fics I\u2019m working on (just want to get them a bit closer to done before I start posting to hopefully avoid any posting gaps).</p>\n<p>And as always, I hope you enjoyed.</p>\n<p>thank you for reading! kudos and comments appreciated. </p>\n<p>please check out my profile for any links to other social media.</p>",
    "text": "Draco Malfoy has been missing since the end of the war.\nHarry would be lying if he said he personally has made it a priority to look for him, he\u2019s pretty sure only Malfoy\u2019s parents can count themselves among that group. \nBut he isn\u2019t exactly not looking for him either.\nThere are rumors of course, about what had happened to him, that he\u2019d presented as an omega some time during the final battle and been spirited away by dark wizards or witches unknown, to be sold off to the highest bidder. Or that his parents had sent him away to the U.S. to avoid trial. There are also rumors that he\u2019d presented as an alpha, and that he and Harry had fought to the death during the final battle, with Harry, obviously, being the victor. \nHe knows some of the rumors to be false, but... he doesn\u2019t know if any of them have any truth to them, and he wonders. About Malfoy, about what had become of him.\nNo one really knows what happened to him, he supposes, except presumably whoever is involved in making him disappear and stay disappeared. \nStill, during idle moments Harry will often find himself searching the news for that familiar name. At the presentation parties he is endlessly invited to, and sometimes attends just because he is tired of people complaining that he is still single, there is always some small part of him disappointed not to spot a certain blonde slytherin among those being presented to society as freshly minted, and available, omegas.\nWhich is just ridiculous really, because even if Malfoy had been found and even if he had presented as an omega and even if he wasn\u2019t already bonded to someone, and that was an awful lot of if\u2019s, it will have at least made the papers before the party. Probably.\nBut mostly he has moved on. \nIt\u2019s not like he and Malfoy had ever been together, it\u2019s not like prior to Malfoy\u2019s disappearance he had ever even wanted to be with Malfoy, but still\u2026 he wonders.\nWhen Harry finally gets news that Malfoy has been found it comes not from the Daily Prophet, or the Quibbler, or even from any of the high society gossips Harry is forced to socialize with at the presentation parties, but instead, surprisingly, from Ron.\nRon and Hermione had lived with Harry for a while after the war, but they had eventually moved on to a place of their own. The three of them still get together once a week for dinner though, and it is at one of these dinners that the subject comes up.\nRon arrives late, still in his auror robes and looking taxed. Harry is hosting this week, and when Ron arrives he is finishing up dinner and Hermione is reviewing some case files of hers.\nRon immediately goes to Hermione and sweeps her up in his arms, holding her tightly and burying his face in her hair. \nRon, who had entered the auror academy shortly after the war, had taken to being an auror like a fish to water, but there are still some things he has to see and deal with in the course of his job that make him question if he wants to keep doing it, and it seems that today has been one of those days.\nOnce Ron has been sufficiently calmed by his mate\u2019s presence and reassurances, dinner is ready so they all settle in at the large wooden table in Harry\u2019s kitchen to eat.\n\u201cRaid today. Illegal brothel.\u201d Ron says eventually. \u201cWe found\u2026\u201d\nHe has to stop to clear his throat, and Hermione leans into his side in a comforting gesture.\n\u201cWe found a lot of trafficked omegas.\u201d\nOmegas being bought and sold isn\u2019t technically illegal, so long as it is under the pretense of bonding and dowries paid to the omega\u2019s families. After all, an omega belongs to the head of their family until such a time as they are bonded, then they belong to the person they are bonded to. \nOmega prostitutes, though, are extremely illegal. Unfortunately, they can also fetch a much higher price for their rarity and desirability. So it isn\u2019t unheard of for this kind of thing to happen. \n\u201cThe healers say that they should\u2026 should survive.\u201d\nProstitution is a line of work that will kill an omega eventually, if nothing else does first. Being mounted by someone who isn\u2019t their bonded mate would be physical and mental torture, as would being repeatedly marked and bonded.\nThere is only so much a person can take.\nRon is holding on to Hermione like he needs the reassurance that she is there and okay, and she is trying to comfort him with quiet murmurs.\nHermione is a beta, and she\u2019s more than capable of holding her own in a fight if needed. But Harry can understand Ron, who is an alpha same as Harry, needing the reassurance that his mate is okay either way.\nInstincts aren\u2019t exactly logical things after all.\nHarry feels like he is intruding on a personal moment watching them, so he turns his attention back to his food, even though his appetite is gone.\n\u201cSome\u2026 some of them are going to have to stay at St. Mungo\u2019s.\u201d Ron continues, eventually. \u201cAnd there are some we still have to sort out bond wise.\u201d\nThere would have to be trials, to determine the legal validity of any bonds any of the omegas were still under, but with a case like this the trials should be over quickly with the Ministry ruling them invalid and sending the omegas home to their families.\nThese omegas will likely always be considered \u201cdamaged goods\u201d, and will likely never be able to make as good of matches as they otherwise would have, but... omegas are desirable and rare enough that their families will manage. \n\u201cBut there\u2019s one, even\u2026 even if his trial goes the way it should and his previous bond is deemed invalid, we\u2019ve got nowhere to send him.\u201d Ron says. \u201cHe only has one alpha relative, and he\u2019s a known criminal so the ministry can\u2019t release custody of an omega to him.\u201d\nHermione frowns. \n\u201cDoesn\u2019t the ministry have a program to help find suitable mates for omegas in cases like this?\u201d Hermione asks. \n\u201cYeah, but it\u2019s all voluntary.\u201d Ron says. \u201cThere\u2019s loads of alphas happy to take on an orphaned omega, and some even willing to take one with a troubled past, but the problem is we doubt anyone who qualifies for the program will be interested in this one.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s\u2026 he\u2019s in bad shape. Tons of marks. The healers were shocked he was still alive.\u201d Ron says, adding as an afterthought \u201cMust have been there for years.\u201d\n\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t get any decent offers, I\u2019ll take him.\u201d Harry says. He hasn\u2019t even consciously had the thought before it's already out of his mouth.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cMate, no.\u201d Hermione and Ron speak at the same time.\nHarry shrugs. \n\u201cWhy not? I haven\u2019t found anyone I\u2019m interested in elsewhere. I don\u2019t mind about the marks, and it sounds like this guy could do with someone treating him kindly for once.\u201d He didn\u2019t plan to volunteer, but now that he has he thinks he rather likes the idea. \n\u201cHarry, when you kept turning people down I thought you just weren\u2019t interested in settling down yet-\u201d Hermione says, before Ron interrupts. \n\u201cYou know I\u2019m not supposed to name names in cases like these even with you guys but mate you can\u2019t just agree to that sort of thing without even knowing who we\u2019re talking about.\u201d Ron says.\nHe knows Ron has a good point, but he\u2019s kind of commited to this idea now. \n\u201cDoes it matter? You guys know I\u2019m not picky about gender and stuff.\u201d Harry says. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s safe to say at this point, that I\u2019m never going to find the \u2018one\u2019 or whatever.\u201d\n\u201cSo why not help if I can?\u201d\nRon makes a strangled kind of frustrated sound and gestures at Harry with a wild look at Hermione as if to say \u2018help me talk some sense into him\u2019.\nHermione just shrugs, which only seems to make Ron more frustrated. \n\u201cFine. Fine, I know if I try to push this right now, you\u2019re just going to dig your heels in and become more stubborn about this so fine.\u201d Ron says, sounding exasperated. \u201cJust- just promise me you won't officially agree to anything without finding out who it is first.\u201d\n\u201cI feel bad for the guy, and I want him to find a place where he can recover, but it\u2019ll do neither of you any good if you rush into this and then realize its not something you can actually deal with.\u201d Ron says. And Harry feels sufficiently chastised for being so flippant about the matter. \n\u201cOkay, I won't rush into anything.\u201d Harry says, and Ron sighs in relief. \u201cBut I do want to consider what I can do to help, whatever that is, so how do I go about finding out more?\u201d\n\u201cWell Ron, you can talk about the available omegas with the alphas in the program can\u2019t you? Harry hasn\u2019t officially been approved yet but we all know he will be its just a matter of having to fill out a bit of parchment really. He far exceeds the program\u2019s minimum requirements for housing, finances, and good standing. So maybe you could just tell him?\u201d Hermione says, she frames it like this is all to make things go smoother and easier for the two of them, but they can both see her barely contained curiosity.\nRon thinks about it a moment. He\u2019s certainly not opposed to bending or even breaking the rules on occasion, but maintaining the confidentiality of the people he helps in cases like these is more than just a rule to him, it\u2019s something he considers very important.\n\u201cNo matter the outcome, this information goes no further than here.\u201d Ron says, seriously.\n\u201cOf course.\u201d Hermione says, and Harry nods as well.\n\u201cIt\u2019s.. it\u2019s Malfoy.\u201d Ron says. \nHermione gasps. Ron keeps talking, but to Harry everything sounds far more distant than it did a moment ago.\n\u201cMaybe you could write a letter to put in his file, if you\u2019re still insistent on helping somehow. That should help at least, with those that are hesitant about him having a dark mark and everything. You can still see it, I mean it\u2019s faded and kind of mangled by scars, but it\u2019s still there-\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d Harry says quietly, rushing into something he isn\u2019t sure he can actually handle. He clears his throat and says again, louder. \u201cI\u2019ll take him.\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t know why, but he just feels like this is something he needs to do.\nHermione had been right. Getting approved for the program is a breeze. The ministry witch who is handling his application doesn\u2019t even bother with the home inspection. She uses the interview, which is supposed to be used to confirm that he is of fit mind to take on and bond with a vulnerable omega, instead as an excuse to question why he is interested in going this route to getting a mate, when he has so many options.\nShe doesn\u2019t seem to believe that he could possibly just be philanthropic, or that he may be harboring an old flame for his former classmate. She mentions her niece, a lovely young girl and newly presented omega, no less than ten times.\nBut he gets through it, and it seems to have been, in his case at least, merely a formality really. His application is already stamped and approved by the time the interview is over, much to the chagrin of the witch he\u2019d been interviewing with.\nAfter that, it\u2019s only a matter of waiting until Malfoy\u2019s trial. \nWhich proves more difficult then he expects. \nHarry doesn\u2019t work, he doesn\u2019t really need to between his investments and savings, and the seemingly endless hours between being approved and Malfoy\u2019s trial are the first time he really regrets that decision. \nHe tries to occupy his time with Teddy and home repairs, but Teddy\u2019s a growing kid and only has so much time to spend with his godfather and Harry has already fixed up pretty much everything in Grimmauld Place over the last few years. \nSo he finds himself fixing things at Hermione and Ron\u2019s instead. \nThey\u2019re both so busy with their respective jobs, so there\u2019s always something that\u2019s not quite working right even in their small starter home, and Harry had found, after throwing himself into renovating Grimmauld Place after the war, that this sort of work relaxes him. \nThat\u2019s not to say though, that things at Ron and Hermione\u2019s are exactly tension free. Ron still doesn\u2019t get why he\u2019s doing this and Harry doesn\u2019t know how to explain something he doesn\u2019t really understand himself.\nHermione at least, seems not to question it. \nInstead she hounds him with facts and advice and tips from the stack of books she had picked up about both dealing with omegas, and previously trafficked people. \nOn the one hand, he\u2019s happy that she at least seems to be okay with his decision, on the other... their discussions on what Malfoy may or may not have been through do nothing to settle his fraying nerves.\nHarry attends the trial.\nHe\u2019s not required to, but at this point he\u2019s desperate to see Malfoy for himself. To confirm with his own eyes that Malfoy really has been found, that he is okay. And though he knows that Malfoy may very well not even notice him in the crowd, he hates the thought of Malfoy having to face this alone.\nMalfoy\u2019s father is a convicted death eater. Though he had spent the years since the war seemingly doing nothing but accepting his sentence, Azkaban followed by parole, and searching for his son; convicted criminals of his level were not people the Ministry could release custody of, or information regarding, a vulnerable omega to.\nNarcissa, as an omega, was allowed to stay in her home and with Lucius, as she had been his mate a long time prior to his conviction and there was no evidence to suggest that she needed to be removed for her safety, but as an omega she was no more able to take custody of her son then her son was to take custody of himself. \nAs far as Harry knows, Malfoy\u2019s parents still haven\u2019t even been informed that he had been found. \nHe\u2019d have to remember to find out how Malfoy wants to handle that. He doesn\u2019t exactly relish the thought of having Lucius and Narcissa over for tea, but if Malfoy wants a relationship with his parents Harry will do what he can manage to accommodate that. \nOf the omegas who were found in the raid, all of those who currently have bonds, and who were deemed by healers to be fit for release, have their trials today. This is, Harry knows from his conversations with Ron and Hermione, to reduce the amount of times the raiding aurors have to testify, and to allow the omegas to take comfort in each other's presence while they wait for their turns. \nBecause of this the trials will likely take most of the day. \nHe had planned to try to stay calm. He had hoped that, if Malfoy did see him, that he could be some sort of comfort to him by remaining calm. But having to watch omega after omega being brought into the room to face whatever scumbag they are currently bonded to, the smell of their fear heavy in the room, has him practically clawing at the armrest on his chair before they even get to Malfoy\u2019s case. He can hardly hear Hermione sitting next to him, trying to tell him to calm down.\nMalfoy is bonded to some low level john. This man\u2019s arrest isn\u2019t exactly a big win for the department, but Harry still hopes he gets punished as much as possible. \nWhen Malfoy enters the room, it feels as though all the breath has been knocked out of Harry\u2019s lungs. \nThe Slytherin is almost unrecognizable. \nHis platinum blonde hair hangs limply around his face, and it looks as though it had been cut clumsily by hand. His eyes, when he briefly scans the room upon entering, look dull and whatever brief flicker of hope may have been there is gone by the time he drops his head again to stare at the floor. \nHe is wearing a button up shirt, a jacket, and trousers, same as the others, but Harry can still see some of the marks. They crawl up his neck, and he even seems to have some on his hands.\nHarry feels sick. And as they continue with the trial, with Malfoy not once speaking or looking up again, he can feel fury burning in his throat. \nMalfoy, who had always been such a proud git, looks so small and so broken, alone in a rickety looking chair before a crowd of strangers. \nHarry wants to tear apart whoever is responsible.\n--------------\nDraco had tried. He had tried very very hard, not to hope. But so many of the others had come back to the room they had them waiting in crying about how such and such relative was out there, in the room where they were holding the trials, waiting for them. \nHe knows, he knows how dangerous it is to hope for things. \nIf this had happened when he was younger, he is sure he would have cried when he realized that his parents are decidedly not there. In fact the only people he recognizes in the crowd are Potter and Granger, and just the memory of the fury in Potter\u2019s gaze as he looked at him makes him shiver.\nThere had been some part of him in his early time\u2026 away... that had hoped, desperately, that Potter would someday come and save him.\nAfter all, it\u2019s what Potter did. \nBut that stupid naive part of him had died years ago. \nHe spends the rest of the trial with his head down, and he doesn\u2019t really hear anything that is said. The trials are really just a formality, the aurors had explained to them. Officially they have to happen, and the people on trial are entitled to face them. But the bonds are going to be deemed invalid, the evidence the aurors found in the raid too strong for anyone to squirrel their way out of a conviction.\nDraco can\u2019t particularly find it in himself to care. He probably couldn\u2019t pick out who he is bonded to in a line up. Some of the others are struggling with their emotions though, and when he is led back to the waiting room he can hear them talking and crying about it.\nOn the one hand, they want to be free of this, free to seek out proper bonds, but by their nature their bonds make them, at least to some extent, want to stay bonded to whoever they are bonded to currently.\nHe wonders what will become of him now. What will become of him, an omega not legally able to care for himself, with the bond he is currently in deemed invalid, his masters all in prison, and his parents either unwilling or unable to come for him. \nWhere will he be sent from here?\nPart of him kind of hopes it will be back to St Mungos. The thought of spending a lifetime in the small room they had assigned to him there isn\u2019t exactly a pleasant one, but he knows there are far worse ways to live. \nThat seems unlikely though. \nHe\u2019d serve no purpose locked away in his quiet white room, and why would anyone pay for that.\nHe\u2019s not sure how much longer the trials take. The others don\u2019t bother trying to speak with him, having already learned there is no point. \nHe picks at the hem on the shirt he had been given. He doesn\u2019t let himself think more on what will become of him. Not thinking about anything is a talent for which he has a great deal of practice. \nAt some point, it seems the trials are over, and aurors start appearing to lead them off individually. The others mostly follow the aurors with a mixture of excitement and trepidation.\nEventually he is the last one left.\nIt\u2019s uncomfortably quiet now, and he does not know how long he waits there alone. It\u2019s been a long time since time really had any meaning to him.\n\u201cMalfoy.\u201d \nIt\u2019s Weasley. He\u2019s an auror now, which is weird to try and wrap his head around, and he had been there during the raid. Draco\u2019s mind briefly remembers the shameful state he\u2019d been found in, before skittering away from the painful thought. Weasley is standing in the doorway, and looking to Malfoy expectantly.\nDraco drops his gaze but stands and goes to Weasley obediently. Weasley leads him out of the room and down a hallway. \n\u201cWe have a program in place to find places for people in your position.\u201d Weasley begins as they walk, all business. \u201cSince you don\u2019t have anyone who can claim you, the ministry has paired you up with a suitable alpha volunteer.\u201d\nDraco stomach turns. He has never had any choice in the alphas he\u2019d been with, it doesn\u2019t surprise him not to have a choice now, but belonging to a singular alpha had always gone worse for him then belonging to a group of masters who would make him work for his keep.\nA singular master would grow frustrated with him quickly he is sure, and then where would he be sent?\nWeasley stops abruptly in front of a door and takes a step closer to Draco. It is only a great deal of practice that keeps Draco from flinching when the alpha reaches towards him.\nIt seems auror training has done Weasley good though, because he seems to notice the fear even despite Draco\u2019s restraint. \n\u201cSorry.\u201d He says in a hushed voice. He stops reaching towards Malfoy and instead holds up what is in his hand for Draco to see. It\u2019s a small scrap of parchment.\n\u201cMy floo address.\u201d Weasley continues, in that same hushed voice that makes Draco feel sick. \u201cIf you need anything, call me.\u201d\nWeasley tucks the parchment into the pocket of the jacket Draco had been given. Draco nods, because he\u2019s pretty sure that that is what Weasley wants him to do.\nWeasley smells bonded. But alphas can have multiple bonds, and anyway it wouldn\u2019t be the first time Draco has met an alpha just looking for a little bit on the side. \nThe thought of being Weasley\u2019s \u2018little bit on the side\u2019 makes him feel a bit sick, just over the fact that it\u2019s Weasley, but if he\u2019s honest Weasley is young and fit and he\u2019s been mounted by far worse.\nWhen Weasley opens the door for him and he steps through to meet the alpha who has apparently volunteered to claim him though, suddenly Weasley doesn\u2019t seem like all that bad of a prospect. \nPotter stands in the middle of the small cluttered office, and he had clearly just been pacing before Weasley had opened the door. Potter\u2019s eyes are wild as they sweep over him, before he turns his attention to Weasley. \nDraco can practically feel the angry energy coming off of him. \nAnd in that moment Draco realizes that he desperately does not want to be given to Potter.\n\u201cAll good?\u201d Potter asks Weasley. \n\u201cYeah, everything\u2019s in order.\u201d Weasley says, striding over to the desk and digging around in the stacks for a moment before pulling out a folder. He hands the folder to Potter.\n\u201cYou can use my floo so you don\u2019t have to go through the lobby again.\u201d Weasley says, nudging aside a squashy armchair with his hip to reveal a fireplace. \nPotter looks relieved. Draco feels like he can\u2019t breathe past the lump in his throat.\n\u201cOwl when you\u2026 when you get settled.\u201d Weasley says, lighting a fire with his wand and handing Potter a sugar bowl full of floo powder.\n\u201cWill do. Thanks Ron.\u201d Potter says. He pulls Draco close, surrounding Draco in his smell, and before Draco even has a chance to react, he\u2019s been pulled through the floo and they are gone.\n\n\n.::Harry::.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry is in a horrible mood. He\u2019s in over his head. He knows it, Ron knows it, and if the look on Malfoy\u2019s face when he reaches for him is anything to go by, Malfoy knows it too. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThis is not going well.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAfter the trials were done with, he had exited the courtroom only to be bombarded by reporters. Somehow, someone had leaked that he was there and why. He had wanted to just shove them aside and leave, as was his general policy with reporters, but as Hermione had helpfully pointed out the victims and their families were still inside. If one of the reporters caught wind of who they were, they might \u201caccidentally\u201d reveal it in an article. Which would only serve to further damage the reputations of, and retraumatize, the victims.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo instead, Harry had led the reporters away. Indulging their questions with gritted teeth while the aurors and ministry staff had lead the victims and their families to other offices and exits.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s not sure how long he had stood there, answering the same questions just worded slightly differently again and again. Trying to explain why someone like him, with so many prospects, would decide to go this route to people who would never understand wanting to help someone just for the sake of helping them.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBy the time the reporters were finally finally shooed away by the aurors and Ron took him back to his office, he had already had a splitting headache. \n\n\u00a0\n\nRon went to go get Malfoy, and Harry tried not to worry about what Malfoy must have thought being left alone for all this time. He needed to get control over himself, and come up with a plan.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen the omega arrived at the office with Ron, Malfoy\u2019s spirit seemed just as broken as it had at the trial. Aside from one quick sweep of the room upon entering, he had stared at his shoes. There was no snide comment about Ron\u2019s tiny cluttered office, and Harry was confused to note that he missed it.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen Malfoy and him step through into the sitting room of Grimmauld Place, Malfoy stumbles slightly on the rug. Harry steadies him with the arm he still has around Malfoy\u2019s shoulders, but he lets go and steps back once he is sure Malfoy is steady on his feet again. Malfoy\u2019s shoulders had been boney and tense under his hands, and Harry can\u2019t help but feel that they could both use a break.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cKreacher\u201d Harry calls, and a moment later the house elf appears with a pop. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThis is\u2026 Draco.\u201d He says, hesitating for a moment before using his first name. Malfoy is his now, officially at least, so he supposes he should get used to being more familiar with him. \n\n\u00a0\n\nKreacher, who had already been thoroughly briefed on the situation, seems like he might actually manage to keep his promise not to bother Draco too much upon his arrival, but his eyes still gleam with delight at the prospect of being able to serve a Black again, even if Draco doesn\u2019t bear the name.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWill you show Draco to his rooms, and get him any food or drink he wants. Then will you send up some headache potion and some tea to me in the study.\u201d Harry says.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe elf bows. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry has to suppress a snort of laughter. Things between him and Kreacher had certainly improved since Harry had \u201cavenged Master Regulus\u201d, as Kreacher had put it, but he is certainly never this well behaved when it is just the two of them.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOf course Master Harry, right away.\u201d Kreacher says, nose still nearly touching the ground. He straightens and turns his attention to Malfoy. \u201cRight this way Master Draco, Kreacher will show you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco seems uncomfortable, from what Harry can tell. He is staring at the floor again, shoulders still tense. Harry wants to say something, but he doesn\u2019t know what to say and in the state he is in... he worries he\u2019d say something that would make things worse somehow. So he just watches them go, Draco following Kreacher out of the room obediently, head still bowed, then sighs and make his way up to the study.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.::Draco::.\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Potter\u2019s aged house elf to leave takes some doing. The rooms he leads Draco to include a bedroom and an ensuite, and are far nicer than any place Draco has been in years. The elf then insists on showing him around, from the wardrobe of clothes that had been chosen for him, and even how to work the taps on the massive tub in the bathroom. The odd old elf shows Draco the various bath products, and proudly tells Draco that he does all the shopping. He tells Draco to let him know if there is anything he needs, an idea which, to Draco, just sounds like asking for trouble. \n\n\u00a0\n\nNo doubt if he does ask the elf for anything, this information would be reported back to Potter. Any inappropriate requests would surely be punished.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe elf also insists on getting Draco something to eat and drink before he leaves him, and insists that Draco decide what that should be. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThis conversation alone is a headache in and of itself. Draco doesn\u2019t know what is expected of him, what is allowed, and he knows better than to ask outright. But his attempts to talk around the issue, and not make a decision that could potentially land him in more trouble than he already feels he\u2019s in, seem to serve only to frustrate both him and the elf. \n\n\u00a0\n\nEventually the elf seems to at least gather that Draco is fishing for recommendations and they settle on a type of sandwich it seems Potter is fond of and some tea. The tea is nice, and the sandwiches are filling. \n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco doesn\u2019t much care for pastrami personally, but food is food, and\u2026 \u00a0hopefully, if anyone gets in trouble for the selection it won\u2019t be Draco, because he had just followed the elf\u2019s recommendations. \n\n\u00a0\n\nAlone at last in the rooms that are apparently, at least for now, his, Draco finds himself drawn to the armchair near the window. His cooling tea and partially eaten sandwich sit on the desk, and he knows he should eat more while he can, in case he has to wait a while for his next meal, but if he eats too much too fast he will only be putting himself at risk of being sick. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe looks out of the tall window to see that under the fading light the house has a small and unruly back garden. The garden seems to have become overrun by children\u2019s toys and play equipment. He curls up in the armchair, turning away from the yard to instead watch the gathering darkness in the sky. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe wonders if Potter has kids. \n\n\u00a0\n\nPotter doesn\u2019t smell bonded, but that doesn\u2019t mean he hasn\u2019t been in the past, or that he hasn\u2019t had children outside of a bond. \n\n\u00a0\n\nOr maybe he is bonded, and Draco is just reading things wrong. \n\n\u00a0\n\nMaybe Draco has spent too long among too many omegas who reek of far too many bonds, and he just doesn\u2019t have a good sense of smell anymore. \n\n\u00a0\n\nGranger had certainly seemed close enough to Potter at the trial, whispering in his ear the whole time, her hand on his. Draco had not been able to tell what she was from across the crowded room, but she could be Harry\u2019s mate. \n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd he remembers, Potter had always seemed close with Weasley\u2019s sister back in school. Maybe she is Potter\u2019s mate.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco, from what he remembers of them in school, is pretty sure neither of the women had presented as omegas, but then again, he hadn\u2019t thought he would either. Stranger things had happened and... he doesn\u2019t even know if that sort of thing matters to Potter. Lots of alphas prefer omegas, but he knows some don\u2019t mind betas.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPotter could have a whole harem of mates, for all Draco knows. He certainly seems to have the money and standing for it, if that is what he wants. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe house seems pretty empty from what Draco can tell, it has the kind of stillness to it that well occupied homes do not have, but it could be that the rest of the family has just been sent away for the time being while Harry does\u2026 whatever the hell it is he is planning on doing with Draco.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe wonders if Potter will come to his rooms tonight.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIf Potter wanted to fuck him, he would be far from the worst Draco had had, and if he wanted to hurt him\u2026 it wouldn\u2019t be the first time a master or client had desired that\u2026 but... the anger he remembers seeing in Potter scares him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nUnable to handle that line of thinking any longer his mind wanders again. He wonders how many children Potter has, how old they are. He wonders if they look like Potter. \n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s a cute thought, a bunch of kids playing with the toys in the yard on a sunny afternoon, all with untamable black hair and brilliant green eyes just like their father. The bright happiness of the image that comes to his mind hurts to think about too much though.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco, much to the disappointment of former masters, has never been good around children. Despite being an omega, he has never been able to live up to the idea of a natural caretaker. He doesn\u2019t have much in the way of experience, and they make him very nervous. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe doubts Potter will let him anywhere near his kids though. If Potter was looking for someone to look after them he surely would have chosen an omega who \n\nisn\u2019t\n\n a former death eater. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe lets himself wonder again, why Potter has volunteered to take responsibility for him. What does he have planned? Draco shivers at the thought. \n\n\u00a0\n\nPotter clearly still hates him. \n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s fair, Draco thinks, he is a rather despicable person, but it doesn\u2019t bode well for what Potter plans to do with him now that Draco is legally his.\n\n\u00a0\n\nShoving his hands in his jacket pockets in an attempt to still the shaking, that he will not admit even to himself is definitely not from cold, his fingers brush against a slip of parchment.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWeasley\u2019s floo address. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe wonders what has happened between the two of them. They had certainly had explosive fights in the past, he remembers they\u2019d had quite the spectacular row in fourth year, but they always seemed to make up fairly well. Maybe it had something to do with Granger... Weasley and Potter are both alphas after all, of that he was sure, and if Granger had presented as an omega and they had both wanted her\u2026 \n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco weighs his options. \n\n\u00a0\n\nGoing to Weasley is a risk. A big one. He\u2019d have to sneak down to the sitting room to use the floo. And legally he is Potter\u2019s now. Weasley is an auror, and Draco is pretty sure technically it would be his job to return Draco to Potter. Weasley had seemed genuine in his offer, but there is no way to be certain. And even if Weasley does help Draco escape the no doubt almighty wrath of the chosen one, he will definitely want something in return.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe only thing Draco has left to offer is his body and though he has definitely had worse, he still shudders at the thought of being mounted by Weasley. \n\n\u00a0\n\nStill though, is all of that\u2026 the risk and the... price... worth a chance of not facing whatever unknown thing Potter has planned for him?\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco doesn\u2019t like pain. He has made it his goal in life to avoid pain as much as possible. Which, until the raid, he hadn\u2019t had much control over really, but\u2026\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco is also really really tired, so tired he can feel it in his bones.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIf he goes to Weasley, even if he manages to escape, even if Weasley\u2019s offer isn\u2019t a trap, who knows how long he will have to service Weasley\u2019s\u2026 interests... until the alpha feels sufficiently paid back for his aid. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWho knows what will become of him after Weasley grows bored of him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAt least with Potter, he knows that, probably, when Potter grows bored of punishing him... or whatever it is he plans to do with Draco... at least Potter will probably finish the job and Draco can be\u2026 done.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe really really wants to just be done with all of this. He is so tired.\n\n\n.::Draco::.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco awakes, hungry and stiff, still seated in the armchair by the window. There is soft morning light coming in through the window, and as he stretches and looks around he is disappointed to note that his leftovers had been cleared away sometime when he was asleep. In their place on the desk is a note. He picks it up, and recognizes Potter\u2019s messy scrawl immediately.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDraco,\n\n\u00a0\n\nI am sorry about last night. Please come find me downstairs when you are ready for breakfast.\n\n\u00a0\n\n-Harry\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nPotter is an endless mystery. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThough he had done it twice the night before, it still strikes Draco as odd for Potter to use his first name, and the way the letter is signed makes Draco worry that perhaps he is supposed to refer to Potter as Harry now. \n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd then there is the actual content of the letter. So short and yet\u2026 what is Potter apologizing for? What counts as \u201cready for breakfast\u201d? Is he expected to come straight downstairs upon waking? Or is he expected to be\u2026 presentable... first? What would Potter even consider as presentable?\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco worries his bottom lip and looks to the wardrobe. Kreacher \n\nhad\n\n said the clothes inside are for him. Does that mean he is supposed to choose his own outfit? What will happen if he chooses wrong? Is he supposed to bathe first? Is that why the house elf had insisted on showing him how to use the bath?\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco hates not knowing what is expected of him. \n\n\u00a0\n\nIf he knows what is expected of him, he can do it, and then things will go\u2026 smoother. He likes clear decisive orders. They are easier to follow. Masters that phrased things as requests and questions are far harder to please, in Draco\u2019s experience.\n\n\u00a0\n\nEventually he decides on a quick wash and a change of clothes. He desperately hopes it is the right decision, as he quickly goes through the motions.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2018Potter already hates me,\u2019 he tries to remind himself, \u2018I am going to get punished regardless\u2019. But still, all his experience and training is yelling at him that he needs to make this alpha, his new master, happy.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe tries not to get caught up in the bath. The warm soapy water feels heavenly on his sore muscles and stiff joints, and the hair and skin products, which Kreacher had said he could use, are clearly nicer than anything he has used in a long time. \n\n\u00a0\n\nAs he scrubs and massages his stiff muscles, he wonders how long is a long time. He tries not to think about it, usually, but he has no idea what year it is, or how old he is. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019d tried to keep track of course, at first. There were a lot of things he had tried to keep track of, at first. But the days had melted into weeks, the weeks into months and the months into years. And it\u2019s not like he\u2019d been allowed to get the daily prophet.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow, it\u2019s all just a big messy blur, one that hurts to think about too much. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe shakes himself from that line of thought and continues with his cleaning. He does his best to be quick and thorough. Alphas don\u2019t like to wait, but they also don\u2019t tend to like if you still smell too much like your previous client, he had learned.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe had learned a lot of things.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWashed and dried and dressed, he stands before the full length mirror in his bedroom and, reluctantly, forces himself to look. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe doesn\u2019t like what he sees, he never does, but he forces himself to keep looking. Checking to make sure that the clothes he had selected, a soft grey turtleneck and some black trousers, cover as many of the marks as possible. \n\n\u00a0\n\nIt isn\u2019t possible to cover all of them. He wishes he could wear some gloves, but not only had there been none in the wardrobe but he would look ridiculous and draw more attention to the issue if he did.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSome alphas seemed weirdly into the\u2026 dirtiness\u2026 of being with an omega with so many marks. And others seemed to be into pretending that that they were going to leave a mark that was somehow going to be more significant than the others. Most though, just tried to ignore it as best they could. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe had heard that the cost of marking a prostitute, even one with as many marks as him, was high, so clearly it was something they wanted enough not to care that he was already covered. Some of the others had said that, supposedly, marking the omegas made it felt better for the alpha. Draco figured it must be true, and only wished it had made anything feel better for him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSighing, and knowing his appearance is the best it is going to get, Draco steels himself to go look for his master. \n\n\u00a0\n\nAside from the route from the sitting room to his rooms, Draco knows nothing about the layout of the rest of the house, and he hopes he will be able to find Potter before accidentally stumbling into somewhere he isn't supposed to be. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe needn\u2019t have worried though, because as soon as he steps out of his bedroom Potter\u2019s house elf appears beside him with a crack. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMaster Draco\u201d the house elf says, ignoring Draco\u2019s surprise at his sudden appearance, \u201cKreacher is to be showing you to the kitchens, this way.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nWithout waiting for an answer, the house elf turns and makes his way to the stairs. Draco is grateful for it\u2019s apparent indifference, as he continues to try to calm his racing heart. He has not been around house elves much lately, his masters had not owned any that he knew of, and the only ones he\u2019d seen recently belonged to clients. \n\n\u00a0\n\nClients he had to visit in their homes, or who brought their house elves along with them, tended not to be Draco\u2019s favorites. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe kitchen is on the ground floor, near the back, and when Draco enters the room he allows himself one brief glance over Potter, seated at a long table in the kitchen drinking tea with a book in his hand, before dropping his gaze and assuming what he hopes is a sufficiently submissive stance.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPotter seems in a far better mood then he had been the day before, and the hesitant smile he directs at Draco makes something inside him twist painfully. \n\n\u00a0\n\n.::Harry::.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen Malfoy enters the kitchen, Harry is relieved to see he is already looking somewhat better than the night before. Not that one night could make all that much of a difference, Malfoy is still unhealthily skinny and looks tired beyond measure, but at least it looks like the bath in his room had agreed with him better then the cleaning spells at St Mungo's. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen his eyes briefly glance over to him, he hopes for the briefest of moments, but then Malfoy drops his gaze to the floor again. \n\n\u00a0\n\nTime, patience. All of Hermione\u2019s books and Ron\u2019s experience had said that these things would take time, he reminded himself. Malfoy probably has a lot to unlearn.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe stows his own feelings, this isn\u2019t about him he reminds himself, and clears his throat. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou hungry?\u201d He asks. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe can\u2019t see Draco\u2019s eyes, his hair falling in his face hides them from view, but he can see Draco bite his lip. He seems to be debating his answer for some time before shrugging slightly. \n\n\u00a0\n\nRon and Kreacher had both warned him that Draco doesn\u2019t do well with questions but he had thought that that one would have been an easy one.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe had wanted to ask what Draco wanted for breakfast, but now that seemed like it would probably be too much. He puts down his book and stands. \n\n\u00a0\n\nEven though he is still looking down, Harry feels like he can feel Draco\u2019s eyes on him. He clears his throat again, awkwardly.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI was thinking of maybe making a fry up, that sound ok to you?\u201d He asks, realizing a moment too late he had asked another question. \n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco hesitates again, looking uncomfortable, and Harry almost thinks he isn\u2019t going to respond. But then he nods slightly. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry moves to the fridge to start pulling out what he will need, Kreacher makes his way off to the pantry to gather the rest. Draco stays awkwardly standing in the entryway.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cGo ahead and sit if you want to.\u201d Harry says, not turning to look at him. \u201cDo you have any allergies or food restrictions?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco\u2019s file, the one Ron had given him, had said he didn\u2019t but best to check anyway. There are things that might not have made it into the ministry\u2019s records, and it is possible things had changed. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Draco replies, after a moment.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s the first time he has heard Draco\u2019s voice since before... probably since whenever he had seen him last during the final battle. \n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s a nice sound, though it kind of sounds like Draco isn\u2019t used to talking much. Which matches with the notes from St Mungos. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2018Avoids talking and decision making as much as possible.\u2019 \u2018Antisocial\u2019 \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019d read Draco\u2019s file in full last night. It hadn\u2019t been pleasant. The information from before the war was pretty normal, school records, some medical records the ministry had retained for whatever reason, a few notes about different committees and boards his father had once been on.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAfterwards, it was all notes and forms from healers and aurors. Where and how he had been found, by who, what injuries he had had, the general state of his physical health, assessments by mind healers.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry forces himself to think of something else. He doesn\u2019t want to get upset again and make Draco uncomfortable. They have a lot to deal with today as it is.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe glances behind him, and is pleased to note Draco has taken a seat at the table, opposite where Harry had been sitting. He catches, briefly, Draco staring at him with open curiosity before Draco notices his gaze and quickly lowers his head again.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDo you have a question?\u201d Harry asks, turning back to his cooking. \u201cIt\u2019s okay if you do, you can ask. It\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe finds that he very much wants to know what is on Draco\u2019s mind. \n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco doesn't respond for a long time, and Harry again thinks that maybe he won\u2019t.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou- you have a house elf\u2026\u201d Draco starts, hesitantly. \u201cAnd yet you cook?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry snorts with laughter. \n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco sounds so worried that his question might offend Harry, and he doesn\u2019t want to give him the wrong impression, so he hurries to respond.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah well, Kreacher makes very good sandwiches.\u201d Harry says, glancing at the elf and hoping the praise will be enough for the next part not to offend him. He normally doesn\u2019t care, but Harry doesn\u2019t know how he will react to anything with Draco involved. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBut not a whole lot else.\u201d Harry says, adding on hopefully \u201cHis talents lie outside of the kitchen.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nKreacher seems satisfied with the addition and the praise for his sandwich making. He had gotten to make Draco a sandwich last night, and had been delighted by it. He\u2019d told Harry, three times.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry glances at Draco, who looks thoughtful. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe looks far better like this, engaged with the world around him, then the shuttered dead eyed look he\u2019d worn yesterday, Harry thinks to himself.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen the food is ready he tells Kreacher to make himself a plate, and then he plates up the rest and takes it to the table. He places an empty plate in front of Draco and one in front of his own spot.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cGo ahead and help yourself. If there\u2019s anything you don\u2019t want, you don\u2019t have to eat it.\u201d Harry says, with what he hopes is an encouraging smile. \u201cI won't be offended in the slightest.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco glances up at him, briefly, then nods slightly. He hesitates for a moment and starts to fill up his plate. He takes small portions, which Harry isn\u2019t pleased with but doesn't comment on, and avoids the tomatoes but otherwise takes some of everything else. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry wonders if he doesn\u2019t like tomatoes in general or just doesn\u2019t like them when they are prepared like this. He wants to ask, but also... he doesn\u2019t want to make Draco feel uncomfortable for showing a preference.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen given the choice of orange juice, water, milk, or tea; Draco hesitantly chooses orange juice. Harry lazily summons the juice from the fridge and a glass from the cupboard, and is unable to interpret the look in Draco\u2019s eyes as he watches him from behind the hair that is once again covering his eyes.\n\n\n.::Harry::.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry is beyond nervous about his plans for the day. He knows what he needs to do, Ron and the healers had said that it was in Malfoy\u2019s best interest to get it done with as soon as possible\u2026 but, he is still hesitant.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMarking Malfoy is a big step, and it seems kind of ridiculous to expect himself not to be nervous about it. \n\n\u00a0\n\nOmega\u2019s can only handle being bonded so many times, what if Harry\u2019s bond mark is the one that pushes him over the edge?\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd- and this seems dumb even in his head, but Malfoy is far more experienced than him. What if he does something wrong? Messes something up? Embarrasses himself?\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe isn\u2019t even sure why he cares so much. Because really, all his worrying goes far beyond not wanting to cause someone pain, far beyond wanting to save someone. The fact is that he wants Malfoy, properly, as his mate in every sense of the word. He wants a bond with Malfoy like the one Hermione and Ron have. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe still has no idea why he wants Malfoy like this, but he desperately doesn\u2019t want to screw this up.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhere should he even do it? Asking Malfoy back to his bedroom after breakfast seems far too forward but surely it would be weird to just do it right there at the kitchen table?\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd where on Malfoy should he mark him? The shoulder and neck area is traditional, and Hermione had said it shouldn\u2019t matter really, the bond would take regardless, but... he doesn\u2019t know if Malfoy would prefer him to cover up one of the previous marks or try to find a place for a new one. Is there a way to ask that without offending?\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn the end, he doesn\u2019t even end up really making any of these decisions, not consciously at least, and just lets chance and his instincts guide him. He\u2019s asked Draco to follow him upstairs, still trying to decide where to take him, when Draco trips on an errant rug in the hallway.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry catches him easily, reflexes having him reaching out even before he has consciously realized Draco is falling. The other man weighs so little, it is easy for Harry to pull him close to steady him, and once he is close\u2026\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe omega\u2019s smell, up close and no longer hindered by whatever side effect of the cleaning spells they had used at St Mungo\u2019s, is quite intoxicating.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry lets his instincts take over, and presses his lips to Draco\u2019s. At first, Draco stiffens under him, his hands coming up to Harry\u2019s chest almost as if he plans to push him away. This, Harry thinks, is probably a last ditch effort of self preservation of the bond Draco\u2019s in currently, the one with the john. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThough the ministry had deemed it invalid, the only ways to actually end a bond are the death of either party, or replacing the bond with a new one.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhich is why it\u2019s important that Harry bond with Draco as soon as possible, Draco will be uncomfortable otherwise, without his mate. He\u2019ll pine for him, and Harry growls at the thought, jealousy, irrational though it is, coursing through him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco relents then, to the press of Harry\u2019s lips and body, relaxing in his hold, lips parting invitingly. Harry licks into his mouth, exploring. Lust and instincts and Draco\u2019s sweet smell clouding his mind, he presses Draco against the wall of the hallway and kisses and kisses and kisses him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry has never known kissing to be so good, he doesn\u2019t have much experience... but still this is far above and beyond anything he had been expecting. \n\n\u00a0\n\nInstincts have Harry pulling away from Draco\u2019s mouth, pressing messy open mouthed kisses along his jaw, below his ear, down his neck; pulling away the neck of Draco\u2019s shirt as he goes. He may have torn it, he isn\u2019t sure, but he doesn\u2019t really care. He\u2019d buy Draco another.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco is making the most delicious sounds now, muffled as they are by him biting at his own kiss swollen lip, and when Harry experimentally rolls his hips against Draco\u2019s he is thrilled to feel an answering hardness pressing back against him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFeeling a delighted, desperate, possessive noise rumble through his chest, Harry gives into the instinct to sink his teeth into the juncture where Draco\u2019s neck meets his shoulder.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco whimpers, but Harry is so lost in the moment he hardly hears it. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe can feel the bond forming, tying Draco to him, can taste the blood on his tongue as he laves at the place where his teeth are still buried in Malfoy\u2019s skin, he can feel Malfoy shivering under him as he continues to bite and claim and rut against him. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen he finally feels that the bond has formed and it is okay to release his hold on Draco\u2019s neck, he licks and kisses at the wound till it stops bleeding. He continues as the skin begins to knit itself back together.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn this moment there is nothing that he wants more then to sweep his new mate up into his arms, carry him to his bedroom, and knot him. \n\n\u00a0\n\nBut when he looks up from the wondrous sight that is his mark on Draco\u2019s skin, it\u2019s not to the equally lust blown and blissed out expression he expects. \n\n\u00a0\n\nMalfoy looks pained, and there are tear tracks running down his cheeks.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt feels like Harry\u2019s been dropped into icy water, and now all he can feel is guilt and worry and panic, rising like bile in his throat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.::Draco::.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s not fair. It is absolutely 100% positively not fair.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco has long since known that the world is not a fair place. If it was he would have been an alpha, like he was supposed to be, or even a beta like a majority of people were. If it was a fair world, he would not have presented suddenly and unexpectedly, and immediately gone into a painful heat, alone, unprepared, and in the middle of a battle.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIf this was a fair world, a lot of things that had happened, would not have. So Draco knows that this is not a fair world. But this\u2026 this is on another level.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt isn\u2019t enough cosmic punishment, it seemed, simply to give him legally to a Potter that still seems to hate him. It isn\u2019t enough that Potter still smells like safety and comfort, as he had that night when he had saved Draco from the fiendfyre. It isn\u2019t even enough that Potter\u2019s physical advances cause Draco\u2019s body to respond in ways that it hasn\u2019t responded to anything outside of the haze of a heat in years.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDifferent bonds, bonds with different people \n\nfeel\n\n different.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt isn\u2019t something most people know, as a typical person would only have, at most, few bonds spread across a lifespan. But Draco, who has been bonded so many times in such a comparatively short amount of time, notices the differences. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHis previous bond had been a dull grey, a touch of gossamer, barely there even when it had been formed. \n\n\u00a0\n\nBut Potter\u2019s bond... he can feel Potter\u2019s bond thrumming through his veins and warming his skin. \n\n\u00a0\n\nPotter\u2019s bond feels like coming home.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd it\u2019s too much. Far far too much. \n\n\u00a0\n\nBecause there is no way, can be no way, that \n\nanyone\n\n can want someone\u2026 something... like him the way that he wants Potter in this moment, least of all Potter.\n\n\u00a0\n\nUnder his hands, which at some point had come to rest against Potter\u2019s chest he feels Potter tense.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe forces himself to open his eyes, to look at Potter. He needs to know what kind of reaction Potter is having so that he can be prepared.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe expects anger. He\u2019s not supposed to be acting this way, realizing with horror that he\u2019s actually been crying.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut instead of anger, Potter looks horrified with himself, and Draco can practically feel his rising panic.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Draco says, voice shaking, unsure if he is trying to reassure Potter or himself. \u201cJust\u2026 just a lot of feelings. I\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nPotter\u2019s brows knit together in confusion and worry, but he seems to accept what Draco had said anyway. Potter closes the space between them, holding Draco close. \n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco isn\u2019t sure if the hug is meant to soothe him or Potter, but he leans into it anyway, letting himself be comforted by Potter\u2019s solid presence and soothing smell. Just this once. \n\n\n.::Draco::.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe next morning, when Draco awakes to weak sunlight trying to make its way into his room past a cover of clouds, having fallen asleep in the armchair by the window in his room again, he tries to take stock of himself.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPhysically, he feels okay. He\u2019s been feeling a bit nauseous, and had barely managed any dinner last night much to the apparent concern of Potter, but the healers at St Mungo\u2019s had warned them that this sort of thing is a very common side effect of stopping the potions their former masters had had them on. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHis neck is sore, and if he focuses he can still feel the bond humming under his skin, but when he forces himself to check in the mirror he can tell the wound is already healing nicely. It will make a tidy mark, even though it was a rather deep bite.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAlpha\u2019s have the ability to help heal the wounds they cause when claiming an omega by licking and kissing the wound. Not every alpha bothers with that though, and Draco has the messily healed scars to prove it. Potter\u2019s though, with all the attention he had paid to it, will probably heal well.\n\n\u00a0\n\nEmotionally\u2026 Draco feels\u2026\n\n\u00a0\n\n...\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe doesn\u2019t know how to finish that sentence. He moves on. \n\n\u00a0\n\nAside from his loss of control during the actual bonding, he thinks he had managed to hold it together fairly well yesterday. But Potter is still maddeningly unclear about what he wants from Draco, and constantly feeling on edge had made Draco end the day exhausted and feeling worn out.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe had expected Potter to fuck him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe had been grateful, at first, that Potter had allowed him some respite after marking him. He had clearly needed some time to get himself under control. But then the day had dragged on and though Potter hovered around, seeming worried, he hadn\u2019t taken Draco to a bed, or fucked him anywhere else. \n\n\u00a0\n\nIt seems, to Draco, that Potter hadn\u2019t exactly planned on claiming him. Once whatever lust filled spell Potter had been under when he\u2019d done it had broken, he must have been too disgusted with himself, and probably Draco too, to be interested in such things.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco tries not to let it worry him, tries to just be relieved. Why would he want that anyway? But it does worry him. \n\n\u00a0\n\nIf sex isn\u2019t what Potter wants from him, then what is?\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco isn\u2019t sure he has anything else to give. \n\n\u00a0\n\nStomach still churning, from anxiety or the side effects of potion withdrawal, he makes himself go about the motions of getting washed up. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe debates what type of shirt to wear for as long as he dares. Potter has given no indication that he is supposed to be down for breakfast by a certain time but, he thinks, better not to risk it.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe problem is, he\u2019s unsure if Potter would prefer he cover the mark that the alpha clearly regrets... or if he would take offense to Draco not showing it. There is no way to know and if he chooses wrong it will no doubt be bad for him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nEventually he just closes his eyes and chooses whichever shirt feels the softest.\n\n\n\n\n\n.::Harry::.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry had barely slept. \n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco had said he was okay, that he\u2019d just been overwhelmed, but Harry still couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that he had fucked up. \n\n\u00a0\n\nMonumentally. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe tried not to hover. He wanted to be there for Draco; almost needed to be close to him, help him in any way he needed, but... he also wanted Draco to have space if he needed it. He didn\u2019t want to overwhelm him even more. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe problem is he doesn\u2019t know where Draco is at, mentally, emotionally, because even though he did manage a few responses in addition to what he had said when Harry had panicked, getting him to answer even simple questions is still a chore. And even in those times when the reluctant omega did answer, Harry got the distinct impression that Draco was just saying whatever he thought Harry wanted to hear.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo Harry had spent the day trying to be there, but not too much, and worrying endlessly that he had irredeemably messed up. When he said good night to Draco, retiring to his rooms not because he actually thought he\u2019d be able to sleep but because he had a headache and could tell he was getting irritable, the look Draco had given him as he said goodnight in return was, at least to Harry, unreadable.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry had spent the night worrying and horny beyond all belief in turns. Endlessly unsatisfied by his hand, and by the way he had left things with Draco.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe wishes it was just easier to talk to, or read, the man. But Harry finds him confusing and intimidating all at once. \n\n\u00a0\n\nKreacher can tell as soon as Harry enters the kitchen that he is in a mood, and he makes sure to steer clear of the room and let him work through it himself.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBy the time he is finishing up the food he feels calmer and like he has more of a handle on himself. The timing is good because not a moment later Draco enters the room. Harry can smell him the moment he does, and the smell has desire coiling in Harry\u2019s abdomen.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco smells positively delicious, like always, and now he smells like he\u2019s Harry\u2019s. It\u2019s a heady mixture.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cGood morning.\u201d He manages, resolutely not looking at Draco as he finishes things up.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe takes a deep breath, plates the food, and heads to the table. He\u2019s glad he gets the plates set down before he finally looks up at Draco, sure he\u2019d have dropped something otherwise. \n\n\u00a0\n\nStanding there, nervously in the doorway, Draco has his head bowed so his hair covers his face and his hands are clasped nervously in front of him. The shirt he is wearing today does not have a high neck, like the one he had worn yesterday had had. In this shirt, Harry can easily see his mark on Draco\u2019s neck.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe tries to move deliberately, so that Draco will know he is approaching, and steps over to the other man, his mate, his brain reminds helpfully.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe raises shaking hands, wanting to get a better look at the mark, but then hesitates. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIs it okay if I\u2026?\u201d He asks, not sure how to word what he wants.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco swallows but gives a small nod, still not looking at Harry.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe moves slowly, gently brushing the pads of his fingertips against the raised flesh of his claiming mark. Draco shiveres at the touch, but doesn\u2019t seem to be in any pain. The mark looks to be healing well, but it is likely still sensitive.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe really does not want Draco to be in any pain from something that, in Harry\u2019s opinion, was so wonderful so he leans in and starts placing gentle kisses all over the mark. Draco trembles, but he tips his head to the side, baring his neck more for Harry. Harry supposes that means it\u2019s okay.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s not sure how long they stand there, Harry\u2019s mouth on Draco\u2019s neck, but eventually Harry forces himself to step away. Flustered and incredibly hard though Harry is, Draco needs to eat he reminds himself.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco doesn\u2019t talk while they eat, which Harry is coming to expect, but he does manage to eat more than he had at dinner, so Harry counts that as a win. \n\n\u00a0\n\n.::Draco::.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt would seem that the soft shirt with the low collar had been the right decision. He had been so worried, especially when Potter had greeted him so tersely, but whatever frustration Potter had had with him had seemed to melt away the moment he spotted his mark on Draco\u2019s neck. \n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco does not expect the kisses. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe mark is already healing well, they aren\u2019t necessary, but he is not going to complain. Still so new, the mark is very sensitive, and having his alpha\u2019s lips on the mark that ties Draco to him releases some stupid omega hormones that make Draco feel lighter than air.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPotter eventually pulls away for food, and Draco refuses to admit he misses the contact.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAfter breakfast though, it doesn\u2019t take long for Draco to find himself pushed up against a wall again with Potter\u2019s warm mouth latched on to his neck. Potter kisses him feverishly, his warm hands holding Draco close, as he rolls his hips against Draco in a grindingly slow pace. It makes Draco feel like he is burning from the inside out, and yet he is still, to his frustration, as shaky as a leaf in a winter wind. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen Draco is sure that soon he will embarrass himself and anger Potter by cumming in his pants like some stupid teenager, and is trying to come up with some plan to stop that from happening, Potter lets out a frustrated growl, his hips stilling and his lips pulling away from his claiming mark. \n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco tenses, sure he has done something wrong.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPotter presses his nose into the juncture of Draco\u2019s neck and jaw and breathes in deeply, nuzzling Draco\u2019s scent glands. It\u2019s such a contradictory gesture to the one before, that Draco is left confused and anxious.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSorry.\u201d Potter says, his voice kiss roughened and his lips brushing Draco\u2019s neck as he speaks. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat does he mean by that? Is he as confused by his hot and cold reactions regarding Draco as Draco is?\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat\u2026 what do you want to be doing?\u201d Draco asks. \n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s too much, he knows better than to question alphas but he desperately wants to know what Potter wants from him. If he knows what he wants it will be easier not to get into trouble.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s whispered against the skin of Draco\u2019s neck but he hears it despite how muffled it is. Potter rocks his hips against Draco\u2019s with a whine, just in case Draco had any doubts about what he means. \n\n\u00a0\n\nOh.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSurely he can\u2019t mean? \n\n\u00a0\n\nPotter had always been unfailingly awkward as a teenager when it came to romantic situations, and Draco had heard there was a rather disproportionate number of alphas in their generation (with many people blaming the war), but surely\u2026\n\n\u00a0\n\nPotter could not be a virgin. \n\n\u00a0\n\nPeople would have no doubt been throwing themselves at him since the end of the war, and though Potter did seem the type to have old fashioned ideas about certain things\u2026 that didn\u2019t explain what he was doing with Draco if that was the case\u2026\n\n\u00a0\n\nMaybe he does have those kinds of ideas, but just decided Draco doesn\u2019t count? Maybe he had decided that Draco could be thought of more as a\u2026 tool\u2026 to relieve some tension and get some experience in while he looks for the right mate?\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco can understand that, he can work with this.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMost of Draco\u2019s clients had wanted him to be as submissive and quiet as possible, but he\u2019d heard from others about some clients who were nervous or inexperienced and wanted the omega to take charge till they built up the \u00a0courage to take charge themselves.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTentatively, still scared he has somehow read this wrong, he reaches out to cup Potter\u2019s face. His cheeks are rough with stubble and he seems surprised by the touch, but he complies easily with Draco\u2019s gentle, cautious, encouragement for him to look up. When he does, Draco searches his face for a moment, before taking his chances and pressing his lips to Potter\u2019s.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPotter whimpers, one hand flying up from where he had been gripping Draco\u2019s hips to gently hold his face as he presses himself as fully as he can against Draco, kissing him back desperately.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco could get lost in a feeling like this, he thinks, but that\u2019d be a very dangerous thing to do.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTesting the waters, Draco tries gently pushing Potter away, who immediately, if reluctantly, pulls away to look at Draco with pupils blown wide with lust. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhere- \u201c Draco has to stop and clear his throat, \u201cWhere do you... want me?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nIf Potter wants to fuck him right here in the hallway there isn\u2019t really anything he can do about it, but he does rather hope that Potter might be convinced to move somewhere with a bit more accomodating furnishings.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt seems to take Potter a while to process what Draco had said, but when he does his eyes widen and he nods.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cUm yeah\u2026\u201d Potter says, still staring at Draco stupidly. \u201cYeah we should um\u2026\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nPotter seems to give up on talking, and instead leads Draco by the hand upstairs to a bedroom across the hall from the one Draco had been given. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThis bedroom is smaller than his, he notes with some surprise. He had expected to have been given the smallest one. The bed in this room is big and looks far comfier than the floor of the hallway though, so Draco definitely can\u2019t complain. He glances at Potter to find him standing by the closed door hesitantly.\n\n\u00a0\n\nGathering what courage he can, he reminds himself that this is, he\u2019s pretty sure, what his master wants. He moves in front of Potter and drops to his knees, shaky hands moving to the button and fly on Potter\u2019s jeans. He makes quick work of undoing them. Potter watches him with lust filled eyes, and makes a strangled sound of relief and pleasure when Draco pulls his dick from his pants.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFuck, Potter is big. \n\n\u00a0\n\nAlphas usually are, with omegas typically having the smallest cocks if they have them at all, but if Draco\u2019s experience is to be trusted, Potter is on the high end of things, even for alphas.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOf course he is. \n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco pushes uncharitable thoughts about his own, embarrassingly omega, cock aside and sets to work mouthing and licking at Potter\u2019s. Swallowing this one down will take some doing, and Draco needs to work up to the challenge without letting Potter get too bored or impatient. \n\n\u00a0\n\nBut Draco\u2019s not even managed to get halfway down when Potter is pulling at his hair insistently to pull him off. Potter encourages Draco to stand and he\u2019s looking at Draco with desperate wild eyes.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI- Draco that feels\u2026 amazing\u2026 brilliant,\u201d Potter says, blushing a deep red \u201cbut- I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m not going to last if you keep that up and I\u2026 I want\u2026\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nPotter darts a glance at the bed. He doesn\u2019t have to say it, Draco knows what he wants. \n\n\u00a0\n\nPotter\u2019s an alpha, and if there\u2019s one thing Draco knows about alphas it\u2019s that they love to bury their knots in omegas.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Draco says, and Potter relaxes a bit at having been understood. \n\n\n\n\n\n.::Harry::.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco barely gets undressed. Instead of taking off his trousers and pants like Harry had expected he chooses to simply undo them and shimmy until they\u2019re midway down his thighs. He has more marks down here, on his hips and arse and disappearing down his legs. Harry wonders if this is why he doesn\u2019t want to get undressed, wants to tell Draco that it\u2019s okay, that he doesn\u2019t mind the marks but...\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut then Draco is climbing onto his bed, on his hands and knees and then pressing his face to the mattress giving Harry a wonderful view of his arse, and all thoughts of talking leave Harry\u2019s head.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMerlin, he can see slick glistening around his entrance and sliding down one of his slender pale thighs.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe doesn\u2019t bother getting more undressed either, and climbs onto the bed behind Draco. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDo\u2026 do I need to\u2026 to... prep anything?\u201d He makes himself ask, embarrassed. \n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco seems to be doing fine in the lubrication department, but the books Hermione had gotten him had said that sometimes after traumatic experiences an omega might need some extra preparation before sex, more like betas did, because their bodies might take some time to adjust back to being able to prepare themselves. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Draco says, and though his face is partially buried in Harry\u2019s comforter and mostly covered by his hair, Harry can make out a blush on his cheeks and one of his grey eyes, watching him. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cPlease\u201d Draco begs, rocking his hips back towards Harry, and the last of Harry\u2019s hesitation evaporates before the heat in Draco\u2019s voice.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe kneels behind Draco, and lines himself up. He presses, experimentally, against the slick entrance a few times, still feeling as though this must be some dream, before he presses in. \n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco is slick and warm and so so tight. Harry continues pressing, and while his movement is eased by the generous amount of slick Draco is producing, he\u2019s still so tight that it seems to take forever before Harry bottoms out, his hips pressed tightly against Draco. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe leans over, resting some of his weight on his arm on the bed beside Draco\u2019s head, pressing his still shirt covered chest to Draco\u2019s equally covered back. He just\u2026 needs a moment. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe slick and the heat and the knowledge that he is balls deep in Draco Malfoy, his mate, are all just a bit overwhelming, and he needs a moment to get a hold on himself.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco doesn\u2019t seem to want to let him though, for after a few moments Draco starts pressing back against Harry with small rocks of his hips. Unable to form words at this point, Harry grips Draco\u2019s hip with his hand to still him, growling in his ear and licking his claiming mark. \n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco shivers and stills. \n\n\u00a0\n\nFinally, after what feels to Harry like forever, he feels ready to move. He holds Draco still with his hand on his hip and pulls nearly all the way out before pushing back in. This time he slides more easily into Draco and Draco whimpers when he bottoms out again, hands clenching in the blanket beneath him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry repeats the action, and finds it even easier this time. He tries to set up a rhythm of long slow thrusts, but his hips stutter ever time a whine or whimper manages to escape from Draco\u2019s tightly clenched jaw. \n\n\u00a0\n\nAlready feeling himself nearing the edge far too soon he leans in closer to Draco, pressing his nose against his scent glands and then mouthing at his claiming mark. Draco lets out a particularly loud whine and his hips strain against Harry\u2019s grip. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry can feel his knot beginning to swell, and, worried he might get it stuck outside of Draco or hurt him on the way in, he switches to shallower faster thrusts, buried deep in Draco and barely pulling out before pushing back in. \n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco keens, and Harry gives up on trying to still his hips. He groans as Draco pushes back against him and he sinks even deeper. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThey\u2019re out of synch more often than they\u2019re in synch, but Harry can feel a low pleased rumbling sound coming from his own chest at how eager his mate is behaving. Lost in the feelings, Harry gives into his instincts and pounds into Draco as much as he can, his still growing knot pulling at Draco\u2019s rim before Harry slams back in as deep as he can go.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMine, my mate, mine, is all he can think as he continues to mouth at his claiming mark before giving in to the urge to bite down on it again. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe can feel Malfoy\u2019s orgasm overtake him as he buries his teeth in the mark, Malfoy tensing and trembling beneath him, pressing back against Harry, his body clenching and unclenching around Harry\u2019s knot.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry sees white, and he\u2019s sure he\u2019s never cum so hard in his life, spilling deep inside Malfoy. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHis hips twitch weakly afterwards, a pleased rumble going through his chest when he\u2019s sure he\u2019s well and truly stuck, his knot too swollen inside Draco to let him move.\n\n\u00a0\n\nCollapsing to the side, and careful to pull Draco with him so as not to hurt him where they are now tied together, he pulls Draco close, kissing his mark once more before succumbing to unconsciousness. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.::Draco::.\n\n\u00a0\n\nLiving with Potter is odd.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s nothing like he expected that first night, and he still has questions. Endless questions, questions he knows he is not supposed to ask. But there are also a lot of\u2026 pleasant\u2026 things about living with Potter. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe doesn\u2019t understand it, and he definitely doesn\u2019t trust it, but\u2026 it\u2019s not an entirely horrible experience, at least not yet.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe still has his own rooms, which he sleeps in every night, and aside from Kreacher, presumably for cleaning, no one goes into them but Draco. He gets a more than decent amount of food to eat, and he can tell Potter is trying to make foods that he will like.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe still doesn\u2019t understand why Potter is treating him this way, but voicing such questions can only lead to trouble.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s been far from easy. Not knowing what is expected of him makes it far more likely that he will make mistakes, and Potter does get very angry on occasion when he breaks some rule or crosses some line he didn\u2019t realize was there. \n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco always expects to get hit, or to receive some other punishment, something\u2026 but it doesn\u2019t come. Potter takes some deep breaths, or excuses himself, and then he is calm again. \n\n\u00a0\n\nIt makes Draco nervous. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe feels sure this is building up to something, and always feeling like something bad is bound to happen is exhausting.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPotter doesn\u2019t seem to work, and he doesn\u2019t seem to have any jobs planned out for Draco beyond fucking him at least once a day. Draco feels a bit at a loss as to what to do with himself. He can't remember how long its been since he has had so much free time.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPotter, eventually picking up on some of Draco\u2019s unasked questions, or maybe just hoping to get him out of his rooms more, clarifies that Draco is welcome in any part of the house or gardens, except the attic, where Potter explains he still keeps some potentially dangerous items he doesn\u2019t know what else to do with, and the bedroom on the right on the third floor. That bedroom isn\u2019t the one Potter uses, he\u2019s learned by now that Potter uses the smaller one across the hall from Draco. \n\n\u00a0\n\nPotter doesn\u2019t explain that rule further though, and Draco doesn\u2019t ask.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSometimes, like that first morning in the kitchen, Potter notices him wondering about something and tells him to just ask the question on his mind. Sometimes, Draco does. Other times he makes up a question that he hopes is better than the one he had actually been wondering about. \n\n\u00a0\n\nOne day, Potter notices him staring at some kids toys in the sitting room, wondering again why Potter has so many kids toys if he does not have kids, which at this point, he is fairly sure Potter does not. Potter encourages him to ask his question. Draco knows it isn\u2019t a good idea, this could very easily be a sore subject, but he finds himself asking anyway.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDo you have kids?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAh no. No.\u201d Potter says eyes widening and shaking his head, as if the very suggestion is shocking. He seems to actually notice what Draco had been looking at for the first time, and adds in to clarify. \u201cI do have a godson though, Teddy. These are all his for when he visits.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco doesn\u2019t know how to feel about this information. He tucks it away and decides to think about it later.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe explores.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s a library, it\u2019s not as big as the one in the manor but it is far more books than Draco has seen in all his time since Hogwarts. After catching him staring, but not touching, Potter lets him know he is allowed to read any of the books he wants. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe accepts the offer and reads in the library when he feels up for it, but he never takes any of the books out of the library; too worried they might somehow get damaged in his care.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe finds the study that Harry had mentioned, that first night. A couple of desks by large narrow windows, some more book shelves and an assortment of comfortable looking arm chairs and couches. This is the room Potter is in most, when he isn\u2019t \u201caccidentally\u201d finding himself in whatever room Draco is in. \n\n\u00a0\n\nExcept Draco\u2019s rooms.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPotter has not once been in them since Draco has been here, and he isn\u2019t sure if he is relieved or nervous about that. \n\n\u00a0\n\nPotter still fucks him plenty, but it\u2019s always elsewhere, in Potter\u2019s room or on a couch in the library, or once on the table in the kitchen. But if Draco goes into his rooms, Potter does not follow. It\u2019s strange, and Draco doesn\u2019t know how he feels about it. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe feels safe in his rooms, secure, but that security also feels false. He doesn\u2019t want to trust it. He knows better than to trust it.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn his explorations he also finds a secondary sitting room, it\u2019s smaller than the one they arrived in, and clearly sees far less use. Though, Kreacher obviously still cleans it. In it, on the wall, Draco finds a tapestry of the Black family tree. The tapestry is old and worn and has several large scorch marks, but it is still beautiful, and Draco can feel the magic thrumming through it\u2019s threads as he approaches it.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take him long to find his mother. Linked to her is his father, and there growing from them is his name and portrait. He bites his lip as his hand hovers, quaking, above his mother\u2019s portrait. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s too afraid to touch.\n\n\u00a0\n\nKreacher\u2019s voice from behind him startles him, though not as much as it would have a few days ago. For a rickety looking old thing, he sure can move quietly sometimes.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMaster Harry inherited the house from his godfather, Master Sirius.\u201d The house elf says. He nods towards the tree where beneath one of the scorch marks Draco can just barely make out Sirius\u2019 name. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMaster Harry is not the sort that my Mistress would like Kreacher to be serving\u2026\u201d The elf continues, sounding conflicted. \u201cBut he has treated Mistress\u2019 house with\u2026 reasonable\u2026 respect and he\u2026 he helped Kreacher fulfil his Master Regulus\u2019 final order.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen Draco glances at the elf again he is alarmed to see that the thing looks like it might start crying. He follows the elf\u2019s watery gaze to a name and portrait beside Sirius\u2019 scorch mark. \n\n\u00a0\n\nSirius\u2019 brother it would seem, his portrait had not been burned off\u2026 but judging by the portrait he had also died quite young.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cKreacher is of course, so pleased to be serving a proper Black again, Master Draco.\u201d Kreacher says, seemingly recovered from whatever bought of sentimentality he had previously been suffering under.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAs he leaves the room, Draco is almost sure he hears something about how Kreacher hopes Master Harry and Master Draco will get on with having some children to continue on the House of Black. But that is a whole lot of things he can\u2019t deal with right now so, again, he files it away for later.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAt dinner that night, while Harry is distracted by some letters he seems to need to deal with, Draco studies him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIts honestly the first time he\u2019s allowed himself a proper look, not just one meant to assess things important for immediate survival, like status and mood.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s grown, which shouldn\u2019t really be surprising since the last time Draco saw him before his trial he\u2019d been seventeen and only recently presented as an alpha. He is still a bit short for an alpha, but definitely still in that size range. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s also filled out well since the half starved teenager he\u2019d been at seventeen. There is a casual strength to him, both physically and magically. Harry has often lifted Draco like he weighs nothing, and Draco has never met anyone who can perform wandless and wordless magic with such ease. Yet Potter almost doesn\u2019t even seem aware that he is doing anything special when he does these things.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd there is a\u2026 kindness\u2026 in his eyes that some stupid part of Draco that evidently hasn\u2019t been hurt enough yet wants to believe in.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd that isn\u2019t even to bring up his smell, woodsmoke and clear night air, comfort and safety and freedom.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco had never wanted to be an omega. And he had certainly never wanted to present suddenly and painfully, alone, in the middle of a battle.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut... he thinks, in another life, one that had not been so cruel to either of them, that maybe Potter is the kind of alpha he might have actually wanted. \n\n\n\n\n\n.::Harry::.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOver the next few days, Harry finds it hard to let Draco out of bed. He doesn\u2019t want to overwhelm him, or make him feel like that\u2019s all Harry cares about, but also Harry has literally never felt anything better than having Draco in his arms and his knot buried inside the blonde.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe tries to distract himself with trying to find out as much as he can about Draco, and it mostly works.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe finds that if he makes sure not to seem like he is looking, he can catch Draco looking at things other then the floor. The man is still clearly very uncomfortable with eye contact, but Harry is relieved that he seems, at least to some extent, interested in his surroundings.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe also finds that he is constantly surprised by the things he has to explicitly tell Draco. It seems that unless he is told he is allowed to do something, Draco will assume he is not. It makes sense, given what has happened to him, but it\u2019s still something that is hard for Harry to wrap his head around.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry gets upset sometimes, not at Draco, but over the things he\u2019s been through and at the people who have put him through all that. It scares Draco, which just makes Harry more upset because now he is the one causing Draco trouble and he needs to stop. He practices breathing techniques Ron teaches him, and it is usually enough to calm him down. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen it\u2019s not, he makes sure to find somewhere else to be. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe tries not to follow Draco around the house too much. He doesn\u2019t want to make him feel stalked or uncomfortable in any way, but he also always wants to be with Draco. He finds himself fascinated with the other man.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen Draco looks at something with longing or curiosity or even frustration, it makes Harry feel hopeful for the future. He\u2019s still very very closed off, aside from when they\u2019re fucking when he seems unable to hold things back as well as he is otherwise able to, but these moments make it clear that even though he mostly hides it, he still feels things about normal everyday stuff.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry looks forward to the day when Draco finally feels comfortable sharing and asserting these feelings again.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe debates with himself about how to handle things with Draco\u2019s parents. He wants them to be able to rebuild their relationships if that is what Draco wants, but\u2026\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco hasn\u2019t mentioned them, he barely talks still so it\u2019s not exactly surprising\u2026 but it worries Harry. \n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco, and the calm they seem to have managed in their house, still feel so fragile to Harry. He wants to protect Draco. The urge is stronger then he anticipated, and he\u2019s not sure what to do with all of this restless energy because really, despite what his instincts seem to think, there\u2019s no one here for him to fight. \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe isn\u2019t sure what Draco wants, and he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019d get a proper answer out of him even if he asks. He thinks that Draco tries to answer him honestly, but there is also so much he is holding back, and he\u2019s so so cautious. Harry knows sometimes Draco just gives Harry the answer he thinks Harry wants to hear.\n\n\u00a0\n\nEventually he decides to write to them, they at least should know that their son had been found and is safe, though whether or not they would agree that their son is safe with him he isn\u2019t sure. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019d test the waters, see where they are at, and if he feels it is going to be okay to do so, he\u2019d let Draco know that he can write to them if he\u2019d like. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThat is enough for a start right?\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe writes and rewrites the letter so many times he loses count, before eventually settling on:\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDear Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy,\n\n\u00a0\n\nI am writing to inform you that your son was found recently in an auror raid. He was attended to by healers at St. Mungo's and will be fine. As Draco is an omega, it was necessary for him to be released into the custody of an alpha, and as Mr. Malfoy has been convicted of serious crimes the Ministry did not consider him eligible. As such, I have taken custody of him and have claimed him as my mate. He now resides with me in our home, and I am doing my utmost to take care of him. \n\n\u00a0\n\nI am unsure as of yet if I am comfortable with you contacting him directly, as he has been through a lot and may not be in the best state for it currently, but I felt that you at least ought to know he is safe while I consider the matter further. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe wards have been adjusted so that you may owl me, if you would like.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nHe isn\u2019t happy with it. It sounds stiff and awkward and far too formal for him to be comfortable with, but he knows he could sit here endlessly revising and never be happy with the result, so he sends it anyway. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe response arrives just before he\u2019s going to start dinner. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDear Mr. Potter,\n\n\u00a0\n\nThank you for writing us, we understand that you were under no obligation to do so but that you did anyway is immensely appreciated. \n\n\u00a0\n\nI hope you can understand, but my wife and I would very much like the chance to see and speak with our son. We understand that such things must now be done at your discretion and we wish to impress upon you that we will do whatever necessary to gain your approval of such. \n\n\u00a0\n\nI understand that given our history, and my past actions, you may be reluctant or unwilling to allow me to owl or visit, but I ask of you to still consider the possibility of my wife being allowed to do so, even if I am not. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWe love our son dearly Mr. Potter, and it is our sincerest wish that, if he can not be returned home to us, that he at least be somewhere he can be safe and happy. If there is anything we need to or can do to ensure this, we will do it gladly.\n\n\u00a0\n\n-Lucius Malfoy.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe reads it several times, feeling silly now for worrying about sounding too formal in his letter. He is both surprised, and not, by its contents. He\u2019d known that the Malfoy\u2019s were desperate to find their son, but he\u2019d somewhat anticipated Lucius still being too proud for some of the things he\u2019d said in the letter. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe request that he at least consider Narcissa being allowed to write and visit, even if Lucius is not allowed, is not something he had expected; and he doesn\u2019t know how to interpret the slight wobble in the otherwise elegant script that appears exclusively in that part of the letter. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe last paragraph almost makes it sound like Harry is holding Draco for ransom, which is definitely not what is happening. Though, he tries to think of it as maybe a positive that at least if he was, the Malfoy\u2019s care enough to pay. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe thinks it through while he cooks. \n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd when the food is ready, he reads the letter again while he eats. Draco doesn\u2019t comment, he never does. Harry misses his snark and wit, but it is nice at times like these not to have to answer questions before he is ready. He is stalling though at this point, and he knows it, so eventually he forces himself to put the letter down and look at Draco.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco, seated across from Harry, as had become their new normal, quickly bows his head from where he had been looking at Harry a moment ago. Harry thinks he might be able to see a bit of a blush through the curtain of hair that is now blocking most of Draco\u2019s face from view.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe wishes he\u2019d just look up, he\u2019d only ever seen Draco blushing like that through his curtain of hair while they were fucking and he was a little bit desperate for a better look. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry bites his lip, trying to push aside his arousal, and forces himself to focus instead on the matter at hand.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve written to your parents.\u201d Harry says, indicating the letter he had been reading. Draco looks up at him eyes wide. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d like to hear from you, and you are welcome to use my owl to contact them, though you are under no obligation to do so if for some reason you do not want to.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s the first time that Draco has held eye contact with him this long, and there are so many emotions flashing underneath their grey surfaces... but Harry can\u2019t decipher any of them.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe moment passes. Draco drops his gaze back to his plate, and simply nods in response. The rest of dinner passes quietly and Harry worries if he\u2019s made the right choice. \n\n\u00a0\n\n.::Harry::.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe next week passes much the same. It is quiet in their house, but he thinks\u2026 he hopes really\u2026 that Draco is becoming more comfortable. The only thing that\u2019s different really, this week, is that Harry exchanges several letters with Draco\u2019s parents. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe lets them know that Draco knows that, when he is ready for it, he is allowed to contact them but he also stresses that they are to wait for him to make that first move. They respect that, and have not once tried to owl Draco directly. Not that the house would have allowed that, the wards are still rather strong, but Harry would have been notified if an attempt was made regardless. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe letters from Lucius are overly formal, and generally short. He always makes sure to make it clear though, that they will do whatever Harry requires of them in order to secure the safety of their son. Harry tries to reassure the older alpha that Draco will be safe and well looked after with him regardless, but the message just does not seem to be getting through. \n\n\u00a0\n\nNarcissa\u2019s letters on the other hand, are often long and filled with sentiment. She asks Harry to pass on her love in every single one and when she finds out Harry is struggling to get Draco to voice his opinions on things she fills her letters with suggestions about foods and books and even music that he, at least used to, like.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo throughout the week, Harry talks with Lucius and Narcissa far more than he has ever wanted to. And Draco does not.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIf Draco does not want to talk to his parents yet, or ever, Harry won't force him. But there\u2019s something in the expression on his face if he sees Harry reading a letter or the once when Harry catches him staring at his parent\u2019s portraits on the tapestry in the little sitting room, that makes Harry think there\u2019s something more complicated to this issue then he is understanding. \n\n\u00a0\n\nEventually, one quiet night when they are tucked away in the library, Draco curled up in an armchair by the fire reading one of the books Harry had picked up on Narcissa\u2019s suggestions, Harry can\u2019t stand the curiosity any longer.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI wondered if we could talk for a bit.\u201d Harry says. \n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco, when he glances up from his book and scans over Harry briefly, looks worried. He drops his eyes to the floor, hair falling in front of his face, and shuts his book. He puts the book down on the end table almost reverently, always so cautious not to give Harry any reason to be displeased with him.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cUm\u2026 so,\u201d Harry says, berating himself in Draco\u2019s stead for sounding so dumb. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been writing your parents.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to, you\u2019re not in trouble and I\u2019m not\u2026 I\u2019m not upset with you\u201d he rushes to reassure when he notices the hands clenched in Draco\u2019s lap begin to tremble. \u201cI just\u2026 I kind of... wondered... why?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou always seemed\u2026 so close with them before\u2026\u201d Harry says, his nerves making him ramble on. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to explain anything to me if you don\u2019t want to, I just\u2026 I just wondered.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe bites his lip to keep from saying any more. Malfoy stares down at the hands in his lap, not saying anything. Harry drops his own gaze to his lap and wonders if there will be any salvaging their evening of quiet companionship now that he has thoroughly put his foot in it.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhy\u2026 why weren\u2019t they at my trial?\u201d Draco finally asks, his voice quiet and rough with disuse.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen Harry looks up at him, Draco is now looking at the fire, his hands still clenched in his lap, his eyes glassy, and there is such a look of pain on his face that it makes Harry\u2019s heart ache.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSomeone\u2026 someone told me they were dead.\u201d Draco continues, and Harry can see how much it had hurt Draco to be told that, to not have any way to verify it. \u201cI- I didn\u2019t want to believe them because\u2026 because people \n\nlie\n\n.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBut then, everyone else\u2019s family was there at the trials. Why weren\u2019t they there?\u201d Draco demands, and Harry would be proud if he wasn\u2019t feeling so heartbroken.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAre they that disappointed in me?\u201d It\u2019s said as barely a whisper, but in the quiet of the room Harry hears it anyway.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry doesn\u2019t want to scare Draco, or make him more uncomfortable, but he needs to comfort him, somehow. So he finds himself kneeling before Draco\u2019s armchair, trying to be as non threatening as possible as he covers Draco\u2019s hands with his own, squeezing in a way he hopes is reassuring. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDraco, no. They aren\u2019t disappointed in you.\u201d Harry says trying to put as much feeling into his voice as he can. Draco closes his eyes but does not pull away from Harry.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI- I didn\u2019t realize\u2026 Draco I\u2019m so sorry I didn\u2019t realize\u2026 I\u2019d have talked to you about this sooner if I had known.\u201d Harry says, wracked with guilt. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m sure your parents would have been there if they\u2019d known about it.\u201d Harry continues. \u201cThey never stopped looking for you Draco.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco takes a shuddery breath at this and Harry squeezes his hands again, wishing he could do more, wishing he could go back and tell Draco all of this right away.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAs an omega, the ministry could only release you into the care of an alpha. And your father\u2026 because of his criminal past\u2026 was not deemed eligible.\u201d Harry says. \u201cThat\u2019s how you wound up with me. I\u2019d have told you this all from the start if I\u2019d known that you didn\u2019t know\u2026 I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco doesn\u2019t respond, but he entwines his fingers slightly with Harry\u2019s where their hands sit in his lap, and that is far more of a response then Harry expected. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry\u2019s not sure how long they sit there like that, quietly, while Draco works to regain his composure. When his breathing has slowed and he doesn\u2019t look quite so on the verge of breaking down again, Harry speaks. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou are, of course, welcome to contact them yourself whenever you feel ready\u2026 but in the meantime, if you\u2019d like, maybe it might help... to read the letters they\u2019ve sent me?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco looks up at him with wide, red rimmed, but studious eyes. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe chews his lip and seems to debate a moment before speaking.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhy would you let me read your letters?\u201d He asks.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry smiles at the suspicion in his voice and can\u2019t help but reach up and place a hand on Draco\u2019s surprisingly still tear free cheek fondly.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all about you, if you want them they\u2019re yours.\u201d He says.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco seems to debate with himself a moment before he nods. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry gives his hands one more squeeze before reluctantly pulling away and standing up. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re in the study, I\u2019ll go grab them for you.\u201d He says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.::Draco::.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe letters, unlike the books in the library, Draco takes back to his room. He has already behaved incredibly inappropriately tonight, and he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll be able to maintain suitable control over his emotions while he reads these.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s not even sure if he wants to read them. He considers just putting them on the desk and leaving them till morning\u2026 but he knows that he won't be able to get any sleep from thinking about them.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s also some part of him that is scared to go to sleep, scared that when he wakes up this will all have been a part of some bizzare dream. \n\n\u00a0\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be the first time where he had dreamed of hopeful things or happy news only to wake and find that the world was just as dreadful as it had been when he had fallen asleep. It always feels like losing something he had never even really had, and he hates that feeling. \n\n\u00a0\n\nReading the letters is hard.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt hurts. \n\n\u00a0\n\nMaybe, partially, because they are in fact, still them. Just as he remembers, or nearly. His father\u2019s pride is not so much as it once was, and they both sound\u2026 older, tireder in a way, like the years had worn on them. But at their cores they are the same as he remembers them.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut he... he is not the son they have been missing.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey don\u2019t realize it yet, their letters are full of hope for their son\u2019s return. They\u2019ll learn, eventually, what he is, what he has done, the person he became. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe disappointment and resentment will come. They want their son back, and he died. He died a long time ago.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe reads and rereads the letters late into the night, tucked up in the armchair by the window. Sleep finally claims him as the stormy sky outside begins to lighten. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n.::Harry::.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco misses breakfast the next morning. Harry worries at first, but Kreacher lets him know that Draco is just sleeping late. So he sets Draco\u2019s food under a warming spell and tries not to worry anyway. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMaster Draco was awake very late last night.\u201d Kreacher says, shooting Harry a disapproving frown. \u201cSuch things are not good for Master Draco\u2019s health.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault Kreacher.\u201d Harry says, catching on to the not so subtle blame in the house elf\u2019s tone. \u201cI never go in there you know, and it's not like I asked him to do anything that would keep him up all night.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMaybe Master Draco would be sleeping better if he were to be sleeping in his proper place.\u201d Kreacher says pointedly.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cKreacher, we\u2019ve been over this before.\u201d Harry says \u201cI\u2019m not going to make him sleep in the same room as me. If he wants to sleep in my room or if he wants to invite me into his, he is welcome to do so. But until he does so\u2026\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHave you told Master Draco he is allowed to be doing so?\u201d Kreacher asks, interrupting.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry pauses, he hadn\u2019t told him. He hadn\u2019t thought it was something he\u2019d need to say, but given all that he has had to explicitly give Draco permission for already\u2026\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI... I hadn\u2019t thought of that.\u201d Harry says, and the elf doesn\u2019t seem surprised. \u201cI\u2019ll\u2026 I\u2019ll consider it. Thank you Kreacher.\n\n\u00a0\n\nKreacher looks almost smug as he leaves the room to go about his day. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry drums his fingers against the table. Now is the point in his day where he\u2019d usually try to find some excuse to be in whatever room Draco is in, but since Draco is still in his rooms and Harry has not yet been invited he will have to find something else to do.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe hasn\u2019t seen as much of Ron and Hermione lately, he\u2019d decided to put off their weekly dinners until he feels like Draco is more settled, which they had both understood, but they\u2019ll both be at work this time of day. \n\n\u00a0\n\nEventually, Harry settles down to read in the sitting room. \n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s a few hours later when he hears a commotion in the hall. He exits the sitting room to see Draco hopping around on one foot, the other grasped in his hand, a frustrated and pained expression on his face. It looks as though he has tripped somehow and hit his foot on one of the banisters.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe would wonder how Draco manages to be so clumsy, but Draco is still dressed in the, now very rumpled, clothes he had been wearing the night before, his hair is sleep tousled, and when he looks up and sees Harry there is panic in his eyes. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s ok.\u201d Harry says, moving closer, needing to comfort his mate. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco drops his foot to the floor, his head dropping and he seems to shrink in on himself somewhat. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI.. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Draco says quietly, voice trembling. \u201cI slept in so much... I didn\u2019t mean to\u2026 I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey, hey, it\u2019s okay, it\u2019s fine. No need to worry.\u201d Harry says soothingly, as he reaches out and pulls Draco into a hug. Draco stiffens at first, but relaxes into the embrace a moment later. \u201cI\u2019m not angry with you, you\u2019re not in trouble.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAfter a moment of holding Draco and rubbing his back in what Harry hopes is a soothing gesture, Harry pulls back slightly. Just enough so that he can put a hand on Draco\u2019s chin and gently turn his face up towards Harry. Even facing him, Draco looks down and away.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDraco, you are allowed to sleep in however late you feel like.\u201d Harry says, firmly, wanting Draco to understand. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI mean\u2026 I missed you at breakfast,\u201d he adds, nuzzling against Draco\u2019s nose and cheek. \u201cBut as much as I love to spend time with you, sleep is important. You are allowed to sleep as much as you need.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco doesn\u2019t respond, but Harry isn\u2019t expecting him to.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.::Draco::.\n\n\u00a0\n\nJust after lunchtime, breakfast for Draco, he is going to head to the library but Potter stops him.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDraco,\u201d Potter says, and the apprehension showing in his voice and face sets Draco on edge. \u201cSo um\u2026 I normally meet up with Ron and Hermione for dinner once a week. I haven\u2019t lately, because I wanted to get things settled here a bit more first\u2026 but this week I was thinking I... would?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d be coming over here, and\u2026\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe hopes Potter is just going to confine him to his rooms while he has his guests over. He doesn\u2019t want to consider the possibility that Potter might want to share him, or trade him or something.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSuch things had once been so common in his life, but his time ensconced here with only Potter have spoiled him and he does not want to go back to the way things had been before. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIf you want to eat with us, I\u2019d love that, but if it\u2019ll make you too uncomfortable you totally don\u2019t have to. We\u2019ll just be in the kitchen and the downstairs sitting room so... if you wanted you could just stay upstairs and Kreacher could bring you your dinner, but\u2026\u201d Potter pauses and Draco thinks he might be blushing. \u201cBut yeah, I don\u2019t know... I\u2019d like your company if you felt up for it?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco doesn\u2019t like being given choices. It\u2019s weird, unnecessary, and carries with it the possibility of making the wrong choice. Potter gives him loads of choices, and its maddening because half the time even after he\u2019s chosen he doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019s chosen right.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis time, it sounds like Potter wants him to choose to eat with them. But, on the other hand\u2026 staying out of the way in the, probably false, security of his room seems far safer\u2026 especially around Weasley. He still hasn\u2019t figured out what the deal is between Weasley and Potter, and if there is conflict between the two alphas Draco doesn\u2019t want to be anywhere near it.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd Granger, Granger is still a mystery. He has no idea what she had presented as, or how she would fit into all of this.\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe had seemed pretty cozy with Potter at his trial though\u2026\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco nods, and Potter looks relieved.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cGreat.\u201d Potter says, and he kisses Draco on the forehead affectionately before heading off to the study, presumably to let Ron and Hermione know that their dinner plans are on. \n\n\u00a0\n\nPotter still makes no sense to Draco. He\u2019d thought the man just wanted him as a placeholder, a doesn\u2019t-really-count practice for when he found a proper mate, and it\u2019s still the only explanation for Potter\u2019s behavior that makes any sense to Draco\u2026 but there are\u2026 inconsistencies... \n\n\u00a0\n\nThere really is no need for Harry to be treating him with so much\u2026 affection. \n\n\u00a0\n\nIf he\u2019s honest it worries him, an alpha that conflates satisfied lust with actual affection may lash out when situations require they realize the difference.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe chews his lip and resolves to try and figure out more, but... not right now. One daunting challenge at a time, and right now he needs to focus on the dinner he had so foolishly agreed to. \n\n\u00a0\n\nPotter turns him down when Draco asks him if he would like his help with anything, and tells him to just relax and go about his day.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt seems kind of a ridiculous notion, Draco is sure there is no way he will spend the afternoon anything but tense and anxious, worried about what is to come, and regretting his choices.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco goes back to his rooms, and rereads the letters from his parents. It does nothing to quell his anxiety... but it does pass the time. \n\n\u00a0\n\nDinner time draws closer at a snail's pace.\n\n\u00a0\n\nProbably starting far too early he starts getting washed up. He\u2019d been in such a rush when he\u2019d realized he\u2019d overslept this morning he hadn\u2019t even changed clothes. And if he is honest, the time he spends in the bath every morning has become his favorite time of his day. He likes to lay there in the warmth and the suds and let himself forget he exists on this plane. \n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco doesn\u2019t know what is expected of him appearance wise for the dinner. If his father had invited him to join him for a dinner party it would have meant formalwear; had it been his old masters, lingerie would have likely been the right choice. But Potter doesn\u2019t seem the type to host formal dinner parties, and there had been no lingerie in the wardrobe of clothes that Draco had been provided with.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo casual clothes it is.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe debates about shirt collars for a moment, he wants to choose something with a high neck, wants to hide as much as possible\u2026 but he knows Potter likes it when he can see his mark. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe ends up going with one with a low neckline. \n\n\u00a0\n\nIf anything does get\u2026 tense\u2026 he wants it clear who he belongs to. He doesn\u2019t know why, but he suspects it probably has to do with Potter and his stupid smell. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHow does one even smell like \n\nsafety\n\n? Draco certainly doesn\u2019t know. \n\n\u00a0\n\nPotter\u2019s in the kitchen when Draco goes back downstairs, cooking quite an absurd amount of food by the looks of it. He had said it would just be Granger and Weasley joining them hadn\u2019t he?\n\n\u00a0\n\nPotter\u2019s still in the clothes he had been wearing earlier, Draco notes, so casual clothes was probably a good choice. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe can see Potter\u2019s eyes darken when he looks at Draco, even from his spot near the doorway, and he shifts nervously. They hadn\u2019t fucked today, \u00a0and Draco wonders if it might have been smarter not to spend the whole afternoon in his rooms. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe moment passes though, and Potter smiles at him warmly. \n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco ignores the way his heart trips over itself at the sight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.::Harry::.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry hadn\u2019t realized just how much Draco has been improving until Ron and Hermione arrive. It\u2019s not that he\u2019s exactly bursting with confidence when it\u2019s just the two of them\u2026 but he is definitely doing better. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen Ron and Hermione arrive through the floo though, it\u2019s back to staring at the floor and taking up as little space as possible. Harry greets his friends with familiarity and warm hugs, and Draco stands back in silence. Harry doesn\u2019t miss the way Draco leans ever so slightly closer to him afterwards, though he doesn\u2019t know what it means.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDraco, it\u2019s so good to see you.\u201d Hermione greets the omega with a warm smile, but Harry doesn\u2019t miss the way her eyes flash curiously over the visible marks on Draco\u2019s neck and hands, and he\u2019s sure Draco doesn\u2019t either. \n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco hesitates then manages a quiet response. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou as well.\u201d His tone isn\u2019t hostile or derisive, like some part of Harry had been slightly worried it might be, but he is clearly uncomfortable. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry\u2019s not sure if it\u2019s just that he\u2019s still uncomfortable talking in general, or if it\u2019s also that he\u2019s specifically uncomfortable talking to Hermione. \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDraco,\u201d Ron greets, eyes scanning over him. \u201cYou look well.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco hesitates again, but to this he only nods slightly. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe food is already ready, and set out on the table, so Harry sits, and pulls Draco down into the spot on the bench next to him. He figures they\u2019ll all be more comfortable sitting next to their mates, and if the way Draco subtly leans into the arm Harry leaves wrapped around his waist is any indication, it was the right decision. \n\n\u00a0\n\nDinner passes much like countless other dinners with Ron and Hermione before... except... Draco is there too, which is... different. \n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco doesn\u2019t participate in the conversations, which mostly revolve around what\u2019s been going on with Ron and Hermione\u2019s jobs, and what\u2019s been going on with the rest of their friends and family, and a bit about what Harry\u2019s been up to. Ron and Hermione do try a few times to engage Draco in the conversations, but his replies, if he gives them, are short and don\u2019t encourage further discussion. \n\n\u00a0\n\nInstead he eats quietly, tucked up close to Harry\u2019s side, and when Harry sneaks a glance at him he can\u2019t help but smile, overcome by affection for his mate. \n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco tenses any time anyone asks him something, and he only responds verbally if he can\u2019t answer with a shrug or a nod, but it\u2019s worse if it\u2019s Ron who is addressing him. Harry figures it may be because Ron\u2019s an alpha and Hermione is not... but he resolves to ask Draco about it later. For now he lets his fingers brush reassuringly against Draco\u2019s bond mark whenever he feels Draco getting too tense beside him and he hopes it\u2019s enough.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAfter dinner, they retire to the sitting room. Draco sticks close to him in the hallway, and Harry doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s as unintentional as Draco pretends when their arms brush. He briefly catches Draco\u2019s hand during one of these passes and gives it a quick squeeze. He thinks he sees a bit of a blush peeking out from beneath Draco\u2019s hair. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry hadn\u2019t planned to have Draco sit with him in the sitting room, Draco prefers the armchair nearest the window and he hadn\u2019t seen any reason why he shouldn\u2019t sit there before, but once he\u2019s seated on the couch he notices the distance between where he\u2019s sitting and the armchair... and Draco\u2019s hesitation.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe pulls Draco down to sit next to him, and like at dinner he leaves one arm wrapped around him casually. \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco seems ever so slightly relieved, and Harry is glad he made the right choice.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey talk for a while, about this and that, and eventually Hermione brings up some bit in a book she\u2019s having difficulty with. She sends Harry a pointed look. Harry, trying to figure out what it is that look is supposed to tell him, realizes the book she is talking about is one of the ones Narcissa had mentioned, and that he\u2019d asked Hermione\u2019s help in ordering, and he gets the hint. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry hadn\u2019t mentioned to Ron and Hermione yet that he\u2019d given Draco the letters from his parents, and he hopes Draco doesn\u2019t mind the obvious ploy too much. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that one you\u2019ve been reading Draco?\u201d Harry asks. He brushes his fingertips over the bond mark. \n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco swallows at Harry\u2019s question, and he looks up at Harry briefly, searching his expression. Harry tries to look reassuring, and apologetic. Draco lowers his gaze again and nods. Harry expects that to be it but...\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes. I\u2019ve read it before... but I\u2019ve\u2026 I\u2019ve been rereading it lately.\u201d Draco says, quietly. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh really?\u201d Hermione says. \u201cBecause I\u2019m on chapter eight and I don\u2019t really understand\u2026.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry doesn\u2019t follow the rest of the conversation, but Draco manages several multi word responses, and Harry is so proud of him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen he can feel Draco growing overwhelmed, Harry steers the conversation elsewhere. Draco relaxes into Harry\u2019s arm gratefully as the focus shifts away from him, and Harry lets his fingertips drift from Draco\u2019s neck into his hair. \n\n\u00a0\n\nEven sitting right next to him Harry barely hears Draco\u2019s little relieved sigh.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBefore Draco had come back into his life, Harry wouldn\u2019t have minded how late Ron and Hermione stayed, he\u2019s always been happy to catch up with them as long as their schedules would allow, but now....\n\n\u00a0\n\nAs much as he loves seeing them, he looks forward to their leaving.\n\n\u00a0\n\nA few hours later sees them headed home through the floo, and once they are gone he pulls Draco into a kiss. Draco\u2019s lips are soft beneath his, and he responds with the same slow pace as Harry uses. \n\n\u00a0\n\nPulling away from the kiss, Harry leans his forehead against Draco\u2019s. Draco has his eyes closed, and he looks so beautiful Harry nearly can\u2019t stand it.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou did so good today.\u201d He says, and he hopes Draco knows he means it. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco takes a deep shuddery breath, and shrugs. Harry\u2019s worried that\u2019s all he\u2019s going to get.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Draco says. \u201cGlad I didn\u2019t mess things up?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe says the last bit like it\u2019s a question, so Harry responds as though it is. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t. You did so good, I\u2019m so proud of you.\u201d Harry responds, placing light kisses to the tip of Draco\u2019s nose and his forehead and cheeks. \u201cI know it was difficult, but you managed so well.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco seems relieved. Harry presses a kiss to his lips again. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n.::Draco::.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPotter takes him up to his room after Granger and Weasley leave. Draco\u2019s expecting it, and he\u2019s kind of relieved. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThis, he knows. This, he understands.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPotter presses him against the back of the door and kisses him with the hunger of a starving man. Draco lets himself get lost in the feelings, the instincts, this moment.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd then Potter drops to his knees before him, undoes his trousers and is mouthing at his cock through his pants and for a moment Draco\u2019s brain stutters to a stop.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat- what are you doing?\u201d He manages to ask. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMm.. gonna blow you.\u201d Potter says nuzzling and mouthing at Draco\u2019s erection through the fabric of his underpants. \n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco bites his lip to try to suppress a whimper as Potter pulls his pants down and presses his nose into Draco\u2019s crotch, breathing deeply. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cW-why?\u201d Draco asks.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWanna reward you, for trying so hard tonight and doing so good.\u201d Draco shudders, somehow the knowledge that this is a reward because Potter thought he\u2019d done well makes it all the hotter. \n\n\u00a0\n\nAlphas don\u2019t do stuff like this, Draco has never\u2026\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMmm w-wait-\u201d Draco manages. He doesn\u2019t want to stop Potter, hates himself a little for saying what he\u2019s said already.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPotter stops, and turns concerned eyes on Draco. He waits for him to continue. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d Draco clears his throat, he can feel the blush burning on his face and down to his chest, \u201cI want your- your knot.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIf thats ok.\u201d He adds on nervously.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe wants this too\u2026 the mere idea of Potter\u2019s mouth on him threatens to pull an embarrassing moan from him\u2026 but tonight\u2026 \n\n\u00a0\n\nMerlin, tonight he needs some reassurance.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWeasley\u2019s calculating looks all night had made him feel so on edge and even though Granger is a beta he\u2019d felt so unbearably jealous whenever Potter so much as smiled at her.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo, tonight he really, really, just wants some reassurance. \n\n\u00a0\n\nReassurance that, for now at least, he is Potter\u2019s and Potter is \n\nhis\n\n. \n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco wants to savour this, for whatever time he has left, before Potter gets another mate, a proper mate, before Potter sends him away, before something comes along like he knows it will and messes up this somewhat kind of pleasant existence he has right now.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd the best way to reassure himself of that right now, is to have Potter\u2019s knot buried inside him and his mouth on Draco\u2019s bond mark. \n\n\u00a0\n\nPotter stands, taking Draco\u2019s hands in his and bringing one up to his mouth to kiss the palm. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOf course. Anything you want.\u201d He says, like it\u2019s nothing, and Draco supposes, for him it probably is.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco pushes aside bitter thoughts about not making promises you don\u2019t intend to keep, and leans up to kiss Potter.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPotter groans into the kiss, he always seems to love it when Draco initiates kisses, and he pulls Draco with him over to the bed.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe lays Draco down on his back and climbs on top of him, his hand on Draco\u2019s hips, his knee between Draco\u2019s legs and his lips on Draco\u2019s neck. Draco covers his mouth with his hand, hoping to muffle the sounds threatening to escape him as Potter grinds his thigh against Draco\u2019s aching erection. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIs\u2026 would it be okay if we stayed facing each other?\u201d Potter asks, breathless from kissing Draco\u2019s neck. \u201cI think we\u2019ll need to take your trousers off completely\u2026 and if you don\u2019t want to we don't have to-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah. It\u2019s fine.\u201d Draco says. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe doesn\u2019t want Potter to see his legs, would prefer to be as covered as possible, but\u2026 \n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019d be far easier to look at Potter this way, and Potter naked and fucking him is a sight that Draco can\u2019t seem to get enough of. \n\n\nPotter rumbles happily and presses his nose into Draco\u2019s neck. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThank you\u201d he murmurs breathing in Draco\u2019s smell deeply.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPotter sits back and makes quick work of Draco\u2019s pants and trousers, and undresses himself as well, kicking and throwing their clothes to the floor. \n\n\u00a0\n\nLeaning forward onto his arm again, Potter\u2019s fingers dance just under the hem of Draco\u2019s shirt, and Draco\u2019s nearly ready to agree to that too if it\u2019ll get Potter to just fuck him already, but Potter doesn\u2019t ask.\n\n\u00a0\n\nInstead, his hand drops lower, ghosting over Draco\u2019s inner thigh before pressing a finger tentatively against Draco\u2019s entrance. Potter groans into Draco\u2019s neck and he can see Potter\u2019s hips shift above him. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMerlin Draco.\u201d Potter says face still pressed against Draco\u2019s neck and voice coming out rough with desire. \u201cYou\u2019re so good, all ready for me.\u201d\n\n\nDraco whimpers into the hand he still has pressed to his mouth and his hips twitch. \n\n\u00a0\n\nPotter sits up, and through heavily lidded eyes Draco watches him grip his long thick cock. Potter is biting his bottom lip and he\u2019s looking down at what he\u2019s doing. Then Draco can feel the blunt head of Potter\u2019s cock pressing against his entrance. It breaches Draco\u2019s rim and slowly, always so so slowly, Potter sinks in.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWith Potter fully pressed into him, Draco feels so deliciously wonderfully full. \n\n\u00a0\n\nPotter looks up once he\u2019s buried inside Draco\u2019s ass, and then he leans forward, pressing his lips to Draco\u2019s.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd then he\u2019s moving and merlin has he gotten better at this since the first time, far more confident and sure of himself as he fucks Draco. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe kisses Draco breathless, then pulls away and nuzzles his nose against Draco\u2019s neck, before finally, finally, mouthing at Draco\u2019s bond mark. \n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco arches, head lolling to the side to give Potter as much access as possible.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco lets himself give into the sensations, and give into the fantasy. The fantasy that Potter is really his, that he\u2019ll never put Draco aside or get another mate, that Draco will never have to go back to working, that they can be some weird little family. He knows that it\u2019s nothing more than a fantasy, something that can never really come to pass, but it feels so good, with Potter pounding into him and the bond humming happily in his blood, to pretend.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe clings to the blanket below him to prevent himself from grabbing onto Potter, and as he feels his orgasm fast approaching he finds it harder and harder to suppress the sounds that want to escape him. \n\n\u00a0\n\nPotter rumbles happily in response to a particularly audible moan Draco fails to stop, and Draco, recklessly, decides to experiment.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe lets the next whimper fall from his lips unobstructed, and the rumbling is louder this time, and Potter\u2019s grip on his hip tightens.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe hesitates a moment, biting his lip and debating a moment before giving in.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cY-yes.\u201d He lets out on a breathy moan, and Potter\u2019s hips stutter and his knot begins to swell.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cFuck.\u201d Potter says against Draco\u2019s neck, lips brushing his bond mark and hips adjusting their rhythm to his growing knott. \u201cFuck, so good. Love the way you sound.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMy omega, my mate.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s what Draco needs to hear, and suddenly his orgasm is crashing over him. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYours. Yours. Always yours.\u201d He manages in a whisper as he shakes and shivers under his alpha as pleasure washes through him in waves. \n\n\u00a0\n\nPotter growls and sinks his teeth into the bond mark, and Draco can feel him pumping him full of seed a moment later.\n\n\u00a0\n\nChest still heaving, Potter collapses to the side and pulls Draco close, nuzzling his hair and neck. Draco expects Potter will fall asleep. He doesn\u2019t always, but it is fairly common for Potter to sleep through most of the time they are tied together. Which works fine for Draco, as it gives him some time to recompose himself.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDraco,\u201d Potter says, sounding half asleep already. \u201cWill you\u2026 will you stay with me tonight? You don\u2019t have to, but I\u2019d like that, having you close\u2026 with me...\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco should really say no, he should retreat to the perceived safety of his rooms as soon as Potter\u2019s knott goes down enough for them to separate.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe should remember \n\nhis place\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut the day had been so tiring, and he\u2019d slept so little the night before, and Potter is so warm and his arms feel so good around Draco.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Draco agrees, and he can feel Potter\u2019s smile against his neck before he presses a kiss against Draco\u2019s bond mark.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.::Harry::.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWaking up with his mate still in his arms, warm and soft and still sleeping peacefully, is easily one of the best experiences Harry\u2019s ever had.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s still weird, even to him, that he\u2019s chosen to have this with Draco Malfoy, but... he\u2019s always looked forward to having a mate, always known he wants that domestic bliss, that partnership, that feeling of family, that kind of love. \n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd he feels that way about Draco. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s not sure when he started feeling that way, but he\u2019s sure of it now, as he looks at the beautiful man in his arms. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe lets himself study the blonde. Draco gets uncomfortable if Harry looks at him too much normally, so Harry tries to avoid staring, but now he lets himself look his fill. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s doing better. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHis skin and hair look better, he looks less tired, and he\u2019s gained some weight, though still not quite as much as Harry would like.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco looks peaceful like this, Harry thinks. When he\u2019s awake Draco always seems so\u2026 tense, wary\u2026 but like this he looks relaxed... comfortable even.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s still covered in old marks. He always will be. They may fade a bit with time, but as powerful magical marks, they\u2019ll never really go away. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry expects to still feel jealous or angry when he looks at the marks, but he finds that while he still has some anger that Draco had to go through all of this, he doesn\u2019t feel it as sharply as he did before. Now he mostly just feels amazed. Amazed that his mate is so strong to have gone through all of that and survived, amazed that he gets to have a life with Draco.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe presses his nose to the scent glands in Draco\u2019s neck, breathing in the wonderful smell of his mate, and then kisses his bond mark.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco snuggles closer to Harry, and shifts to give Harry more access to his neck. Harry can\u2019t help the rumble of happiness as he kisses his mate more, holding him tighter and reveling in this quiet moment. \n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco wakes slowly, though Harry can tell by the way he tenses when he becomes aware that he isn\u2019t alone.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cShh,\u201d He says soothingly. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, you\u2019re okay. I\u2019ve got you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe brushes his hand through Draco\u2019s silky hair and nuzzles his neck, relieved when Draco relaxes.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe moves his hand from Draco\u2019s hair to his cheek, and pulls Draco into a lazy open mouthed kiss. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cGood morning Draco.\u201d He says, resting his forehead against Draco\u2019s. \n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco blinks back at him, and Harry\u2019s breath catches in his throat.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe so rarely gets to see Draco\u2019s eyes, and now they are so close and looking back at him, so open and vulnerable. If Harry hadn\u2019t been sure about his feelings earlier he is now.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cGood morning\u2026 Harry\u201d Draco says, and again, Harry can do nothing to stop the pleased rumble that overcomes him. He leans in and catches Draco\u2019s lips in another kiss, more heated this time then the last. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s been hard since he woke up, and he would very much like to give Draco a blowjob now. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019d been happy last night to change his plans, excited even, since it wasn\u2019t often Draco was so vocal about a preference, but he hopes this morning will be different. He doesn\u2019t think he was imagining how much Draco had wanted to be sucked off last night, he had apparently just wanted to be knotted more.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe moans at the memory as he kisses down Draco\u2019s neck. Just the thought of his mate, his omega, asking for his knot like it wasn\u2019t already his whenever he wants it, has him aching with the desire to knot him again. \n\n\u00a0\n\nBut not right now.\n\n\u00a0\n\nReaching the collar of Draco\u2019s shirt he hesitates. He wants to ask Draco to take it off, wants as much of Draco as he\u2019s willing to give but\u2026 he also doesn\u2019t want to push things. Another time maybe.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe untangles his arms from around Draco, places his hand on Draco\u2019s hips, and slides down the bed till he\u2019s level with Draco\u2019s naked waist. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe glances up at Draco\u2019s face, where he is watching Harry with wide hungry eyes, and then turns his attention to what is before him. He\u2019s never sucked someone off before, and he wants to do a good job.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco\u2019s cock is\u2026 and Harry knows Draco would hate this description... adorable. Harry loves it. It\u2019s small but so well proportioned. Draco is hard already, and his cock is flushed the softest shade of pink.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPressing his nose against the small patch of white blonde hair at the base, Harry can smell Draco, his natural smell strong down here, and with that, he can also smell sweat, Draco\u2019s arousal, the slick leaking from him somewhere down below, and... he can smell his own seed from when he fucked Draco the night before.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s not a clean smell, but Harry loves it.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe nuzzles the soft skin of Draco\u2019s cock, noticing the tip is leaking precome. Experimentally he licks it. He doesn\u2019t like the bitter taste, but the full body shiver from Draco makes it more than worth it.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe glances up to Draco\u2019s face, and notices with disappointment that Draco is covering his mouth with his hand again.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThat won\u2019t do, he thinks, and he reaches up to gently pull Draco\u2019s hand away, guiding it to his messy black hair instead. Draco gets the hint and tangles his fingers into Harry\u2019s hair. He hums in approval and it sends another shiver through Draco.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry tries to remember what he\u2019s read, and what he\u2019d enjoyed when Draco has sucked him off, and grasps the base of Draco\u2019s cock. He presses a kiss to the tip, then licks again.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco moans above him, this time unmuffled by his hand, and the sound draws a happy rumble from Harry.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe presses an open mouthed kiss to Draco\u2019s cock and sucks the tip in. Draco whines, his hand twitching in Harry\u2019s hair. \n\n\u00a0\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take him long to build up to being able to take Draco\u2019s whole cock in, it\u2019s sloppy and he\u2019s sure he\u2019s not very good at this, but Draco\u2019s cock is small enough that he manages. He has no idea how Draco manages his cock, he\u2019s sure he would never be able to handle that.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOnce Draco lets go of holding back his sounds, he\u2019s quite noisy. Harry loves it, he loves all the gasps and moans and breathy whimpers. He tries to keep track of what all gets the best responses, but he\u2019s sure he\u2019ll have forgotten by the next time he tries.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd he really really hopes there is a next time.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHis jaw is just starting to feel sore when Draco tugs on his hair slightly and gasps.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cH-Harry I\u2019m-\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry pulls back but not all the way off. He\u2019s not confident enough in his ability not to choke to let Draco come when he\u2019s all the way in, but he does want to try to swallow\u2026\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe keeps just the tip in his mouth, sucking and licking, until Draco arches off the bed and comes with a cry. \n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco\u2019s seed is bitter and warm, and Harry doesn\u2019t like the way it feels down his throat when he swallows, but Draco seems to have enjoyed himself and really, that is the whole point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.::Draco::.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s never really had to\u2026 perform\u2026 post orgasm before. If his clients cared if he came, it was pretty much only because they wanted him to come on their knott and things were always over so fast after that, there was never much else Draco had to do besides lie there.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe worries, for a moment that Potter might want him to return the favor. He doesn\u2019t think he can manage at the moment, he feels as if all his bones have been turned to jelly.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut instead, Potter spreads Draco\u2019s legs further, settles between them and pushes in.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt almost feels like too much, he feels so sensitive and Potter\u2019s unforgiving pace and his uncanny ability to hit that spot inside that makes Draco see stars is\u2026 a lot. But he\u2019s relieved that he isn\u2019t expected to do anything but lie there and take it.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPotter latches on to his bond mark with his mouth, and pounds into Draco, and it\u2019s all Draco can do to cling to Potter\u2019s strong shoulders and try not to cry from how intense it all feels. \n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s doesn\u2019t take much longer though, before he feels Potter\u2019s knot swelling inside him and then Potter is pumping him full.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPotter collapses to the side and pulls Draco close, nuzzling his neck and humming affectionately before promptly dozing off again.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco tries to gather his thoughts, to compose himself. Last night was a lot, this morning was a lot. But, he reminds himself, he just needs to hold it together long enough for them to come untied and then he can be off to his rooms to break down in private.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBecause he\u2019s screwed, he knows he is.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe wants too much for the fantasy to be real, and it can\u2019t be. Eventually something is going to come along and force him to remember what he is, who he is, and what his place in this world is. \n\n\u00a0\n\nSomething will come along and force him to remember that things like him don\u2019t get happily ever afters with mates like Harry Potter.\n\n\u00a0\n\nEventually Potter will move on. And Draco\u2026 Draco may not have been so wrong that first night. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen Potter is done with him, Draco could probably be done\u2026 though it seems more likely now that Draco will have to finish things off himself.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe doesn\u2019t want to go back to working, can\u2019t stand the idea of being set aside, or being forced into a bond with someone else, but\u2026 he can\u2019t imagine a future where these things don't happen, not realistically. \n\n\u00a0\n\nSo maybe it's for the best then. When Potter is done with him, he\u2019ll be done. \n\n\u00a0\n\n.::Harry::.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHermione, I\u2019m sorry I know you\u2019re at work, but it\u2019s kind of an emergency and I don\u2019t know what to do and I didn\u2019t know who else to call-\u201d Harry starts in as soon as the floo call connects. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHermione is seated at the desk in her office, going over some paperwork, but she comes to kneel by the fireplace as soon as Harry appears in the fire.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, what\u2019s wrong? Are you okay?\u201d She asks, eyes flicking over what she can see of him. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m- I\u2019m yeah. It\u2019s Draco\u2026\u201d Harry says, sure Hermione can hear the panic in his voice. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong but he\u2019s in pain and he won\u2019t let me take him to St. Mungo\u2019s and I don\u2019t know what to do\u2026\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWell then budge over, I\u2019ll come over and have a look, see what I can do.\u201d Hermione says, going for her own supply of floo powder to make the trip, but frowning when Harry doesn\u2019t move.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s\u2026 he\u2019s in heat.\u201d Harry says.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s beyond worried about Draco, and he knows Hermione isn\u2019t a threat\u2026 but it\u2019s still hard to make himself let anyone near his mate while he\u2019s like this.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh Harry.\u201d Hermione says, looking at him with fond exasperation, but there\u2019s a sternness in her voice as she continues. \u201cGet ahold of yourself and move over.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry does as he\u2019s told.\n\n\u00a0\n\nA moment later she\u2019s beside him, dusting off her robes and wrinkling her nose at the strong smell of an omega in heat which has permeated the whole house. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s\u2026 he\u2019s this way.\u201d Harry says stiffly, and leads the way to Draco\u2019s bedroom.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe knocks on the door, heart stuttering and hands clenching as there\u2019s another pained moan from somewhere behind it.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDraco, Hermione is here.\u201d He says through the door, resisting the urge to just break it open. \u201cIs it okay if she comes in and checks on you?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Comes the terse reply from behind the door. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry can feel his jaw clench. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cPlease Draco.\u201d He says. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m really worried.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco doesn\u2019t respond, but a moment later Harry hears the lock on the door click open. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe sighs and takes a step back, ignoring Hermione\u2019s raised eyebrows and gesturing for her to go ahead. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe has never hated respecting Draco\u2019s space more than having to watch Hermione disappear into Draco\u2019s rooms while he stays out in the hallway. He tries to listen in, but clearly Hermione puts up a silencing charm because he hears nothing from inside anymore.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo, he paces in the hallway just outside the door.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt seems like forever before Hermione comes back out, lock clicking shut again behind her.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s\u2026 I think he\u2019s going to be fine.\u201d She leads with, noting the worry in his face and body.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThis is, apparently... normal for him. He doesn\u2019t show any signs of anything that I believe justifies forcing him to go to St. Mungos if he doesn\u2019t want to go.\u201d She continues. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBut he\u2019s in pain.\u201d Harry says, none of the books had said anything about heats being painful for omegas, uncomfortable certainly, but not like this.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe pales as there\u2019s another pained sound from Draco\u2019s room. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d Hermione says simply. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it justifies forcing him to go to St. Mungos if he does not want to go, and he does not, he was clear on that.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBut Hermione-\u201d Harry starts.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThere are some things you could do to help.\u201d She says, interrupting him. \u201cFrom what he described, the pain he\u2019s dealing with is similar to muscle aches, extreme, but I trust you know how to help ease that kind of pain.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d He says, he\u2019d played enough quidditch as a kid to know how to deal with sore muscles. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe won\u2019t let me in though.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHermione sighs at this, like she already knew, and was expecting this but also didn\u2019t really want to have this conversation.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s scared Harry.\u201d She says, \u201cHe\u2019s had\u2026 bad experiences... with alphas during his heat in the past. Painful ones.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s afraid it will hurt if you try to\u2026 have sex\u2026 with him right now.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI won't then.\u201d Harry says immediately.\n\n\u00a0\n\nGetting knotted was usually a way to ease the difficulties of a heat, but if it\u2019d hurt Draco\u2026 Harry never wants Draco to hurt again, especially not because of him.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI know you won\u2019t Harry.\u201d Hermione says. \u201cBut he\u2019s been through a lot. I imagine this kind of trust is still hard for him.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat am I supposed to do then?\u201d Harry says, feeling defeated.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cRespect his boundaries, talk to him, build trust.\u201d Hermione says, sympathetically. \u201cThe two of you can get through this, it\u2019ll just take time.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAnd when this is done with, try and convince him to see a healer.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry frowns confused.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI thought you said-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI said I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to force him to go to St. Mungos in the middle of a heat when he doesn\u2019t want to go and isn\u2019t in any immediate danger.\u201d Hermione says, \u201cAnd I\u2019m saying, after this heat, try to convince him to see a healer willingly.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m certainly no expert on this, but heats aren\u2019t supposed to be this way. He\u2019s not in any immediate danger, but just to be on the safe side\u2026 best to check that it\u2019s not indicative of some other health problem.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe sees Hermione out, worry heavy on his mind, and relocks the floo behind her.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThen he goes back to Draco\u2019s door and leans his forehead against it, trying to think of what to say.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDraco\u2026 I\u2019m here.\u201d He says to the dark wood of the door. \u201cI won\u2019t come in unless you say it\u2019s okay, but I\u2019m here. I just want to help.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe only reply he gets is a pained whimper. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHis jaw clenches and he practices the breathing exercises Ron taught him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOnce he thinks he\u2019s calmed down enough to keep the frustration out of his voice he continues, speaking to the door, hoping Draco is listening.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHermione said it\u2019s like muscle cramps?\u201d He asks, not expecting an answer. \u201cHave you tried taking a bath? There should be a bath soak in there, I forget what it\u2019s called, but it\u2019s in a blue bottle with yellow on the label, that should help also.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSome professional quidditch players use it, to help with the aches after practices.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOr I could have Kreacher get you-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t take a bath.\u201d \u00a0Draco\u2019s voice is quiet, but it seems to come from surprisingly close to the door.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Harry asks, dropping down to his knees to press close to where Draco\u2019s voice seems to be coming from.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c...don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to get in the tub. Too weak....\u201d Harry only just hears. He shuts his eyes against a fresh wave of instincts yelling at him to get to his mate right now.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIs there anything I can do to help? I could send Kreacher in-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Draco says with a chuckle that sounds pained. \u201cAnything but that.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Harry says, his heart aching for his mate. \u201cNo Kreacher, got it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nNeither of them says anything for a while, Harry listens to Draco\u2019s breathing, trying to be comforted by it and at a loss as to what to do or say.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHave you been drinking enough water? I could send some more in for you, no need to get Kreacher.\u201d Harry says, grasping for anything he can do to help.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe hears the lock click open, and holds his breath, hoping.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWill you help me to the bath?\u201d Draco asks, ignoring Harry\u2019s question, not that he cares.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah. Yeah, I can do that.\u201d Harry says, and stands. He takes a deep breath, gathers his focus, and opens the door.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt smells even more in here, like slick and arousal and Draco. His cock throbs with desire. But then he sees Draco, on the floor near the door, hunched over in pain. Draco\u2019s knees are drawn up to his chest, his head is down, and he tightens his arms around himself when Harry looks at him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s in pajamas, probably the ones he\u2019d been wearing before he woke up to this, and Harry can see that the bottoms are quite wet with slick. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry kneels down beside him. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d he says softly. \u201cDo you\u2026 do you think it\u2019d be better if I tried to levitate you? Or can I pick you up?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cJust- just pick me up.\u201d Draco says quietly to his knees, and even past his hair, Harry can see his cheeks alight with a blush.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Harry says.\n\n\u00a0\n\nLifting Draco is still easy enough, though not as easy as it used to be, he is glad to note. He tries his best to do it gently, pulling Draco to his chest and supporting his weight with an arm under his knees and one around his back, but Draco still winces when Harry pulls him up with him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe presses his nose to Draco\u2019s silky hair, and breathes in his smell. He\u2019s still really worried, but already the smell of Draco, the weight of him in his arms, is soothing Harry. \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHis mate is here, right here, and he\u2019s helping, at least somewhat, he hopes.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe sets Draco down gently to sit on the polished stone countertop next to the sink, and turns on the taps of the large clawfoot tub with a wave of his hand.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe forces himself to step away, and eyes Draco\u2019s clothes. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cCan you manage the top by yourself?\u201d He asks, and Draco nods. He\u2019ll probably need help with the bottoms, if he\u2019s been having trouble standing.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco starts on the buttons of his shirt, and Harry busies himself with finding the bath soak he had been talking about. Once he\u2019s found it he turns back to Draco and has to take a moment to compose himself, the sight of Draco\u2019s pale chest and back, reflected in the large mirror behind him, even covered with old claiming marks as they are, brings arousal back to the forefront of Harry\u2019s mind.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe clears his throat and walks back over to Draco. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThis okay?\u201d He asks, showing Draco the bottle. \n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco glances over it and nods.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry adds some to the water near the tap, and sets the water swirling with another wave of his hand to mix it in.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen the tub is full of warm sparkling deep blue water, he turns off the tap and turns back to Draco.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe stands close, wanting to be closer, and places a hand on the waistband of Draco\u2019s pajama pants, over his hip.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNeed help with this?\u201d He asks, trying to push his arousal down so as not to show it in his voice, not wanting to make Draco nervous or uncomfortable.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco nods, and Harry helps him to stand, supporting most of his weight with an arm under his shoulders, so Draco\u2019s shaking legs don\u2019t have to. He unties the drawstring of Draco\u2019s pants and helps to slide them over Draco\u2019s hips and to the floor. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe has to bite his lip to suppress a groan though, at how soaked they are.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMerlin he wants Draco so badly. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe helps Draco into the tub as gently as he can. Draco whimpers as he goes in though, in relief or pain Harry doesn\u2019t know. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry\u2019s shirt is soaked after, having gotten splashed as he tried to help, but he ignores the clinging fabric.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco has his eyes closed, and his head resting against the built in headrest. It looks like it\u2019s helping, somewhat, though Harry can still see him tense when the pain, which seems to come and go in waves, hits.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe tries to think of how else he can help.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWould a massage help?\u201d He asks.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco\u2019s eyes open and he blinks up at Harry. He studies Harry for a moment\u2026 searching his face for something. Then he closes his eyes again, and shrugs.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry thinks its the best answer he\u2019s going to get, and he goes to get the chair from the desk in the room. He settles it behind the headrest end of the tub, it isn\u2019t exactly ideal positioning... but it\u2019ll be more comfortable than trying to just sort of crouch next to the bath.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe reaches out, tentatively, and lets the backs of his fingers brush Draco\u2019s cheek gently as he moves, not wanting to startle the blonde. He traces their bond mark on Draco\u2019s neck with a finger and Draco shivers.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe starts with Draco\u2019s shoulders, working his fingers into the tense muscles there. He starts with the slightest of pressure and gradually builds up more, testing what Draco is comfortable with. Settling on a pressure that Draco seems to like best, he works his way across Draco\u2019s shoulders and down his back, what little he can in this position.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco is biting his lip, and trying to be quiet. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry nuzzles his nose against Draco\u2019s cheek as his hands continue to work. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou can make noise, it\u2019s fine Draco.\u201d He says, trying to sound reassuring but pretty sure he just sounds turned on. \n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco, almost reluctantly, lets go of his lip and stops trying to force himself to be quiet. Harry tries to focus on the task at hand, tries to ignore his hips shifting of their own accord in the seat, his body trying to relieve some of the pressure building in his pants. He massages up Draco\u2019s neck, over his scalp and down his arms. Any part of him he can reasonably reach while Draco soaks in the bath.\n\n\u00a0\n\nEventually he goes back to his shoulders, because he can\u2019t think of anything else to do and he wants to keep his hands on Draco. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHis fingers brush against their bond mark any opportunity he has.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s pretty sure Draco would stay in the bath all day if he could, it\u2019s charmed never to lose its heat and he thinks at some point Draco may have even drifted off to sleep for a bit, but eventually Harry decides it\u2019s probably not a good idea for Draco to stay in the water too much longer. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDraco... I\u2019m sorry love, but you should probably get out soon.\u201d He says.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco whines and sinks down lower in the water.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI know... I\u2019m sorry, but we don\u2019t want you getting sick on top of already not feeling good.\u201d Harry says, fighting the urge to just give in to his adorable mate. \u201cC\u2019mon. I\u2019ll help.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nGetting Draco out of the tub sets Harry\u2019s clothes awash with a fresh wave of splashing water, but he ignores it as he wraps Draco up in the biggest fluffiest towel he can find.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco seems a little steadier on his feet, less shaky in general, but Harry still sweeps him up into his arms once he\u2019s bundled up in the towel and carries him to the bed. He sets Draco down carefully and tucks him into the soft blanket. \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco yawns and snuggles deeper. Harry turns away to try and adjust himself less obviously. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s when he notices the potions still sitting on the desk.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDraco,\u201d he says going over to the desk, \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you take these?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t.\u201d Draco says, sounding sleepy. \u201cMy stomach was too upset. Could probably manage now though.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry brings the potions, a general pain relieving potion and a nutrient potion, to Draco frowning. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say anything?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco just shrugs and shifts up onto his elbows to drink the potions as Harry hands them to him. Harry puts the empty vials back on the desk. He kneels down next to the bed, resting his arms on the bed and his head on his arms and looking Draco over worriedly.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhere does it hurt? Is it all over or\u2026?\u201d Harry asks.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAll over, but\u2026 it's worse around my stomach.\u201d Draco says, he looks uncomfortable, embarrassed. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Harry says, and places a hand on Draco\u2019s cheek, leaning in to kiss him as he stands. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe thinks he sees sadness in Draco\u2019s eyes for a brief moment before his expression becomes carefully blank. Harry doesn\u2019t understand it, but it makes his heart hurt.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cJust a moment, really. I just need to get some things.\u201d He says hesitating, and he tries to give Draco a reassuring smile.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe goes to the door and leans out into the hallway, kind of worried if he leaves the room he won't be welcome back.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cKreacher\u201d He calls. The elf appears with a pop a moment later, wringing his long bony fingers with worry.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIs Master Draco okay?\u201d The elf asks. Harry\u2019s not sure between the two of them who has been more worried about Draco since waking this morning to this\u2026 situation.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be fine, he\u2019s just not feeling well right now.\u201d Harry says, trying to be reassuring despite his own still very present worry. \u201cWill you get a warm water bottle and a fresh set of pajamas for me?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cRight away Master Harry.\u201d The elf says, and disappears with another pop.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry waits in the doorway, knowing Draco does not want Kreacher coming in, and the elf returns a few moments later with the requested items.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Harry says, taking the items and going back in the room, shutting the door behind him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco\u2019s eyes are on him, he can feel it, but he knows as soon as he looks Draco will try to look away. Draco doesn\u2019t like to be caught staring. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe sets the temperature on the water bottle and hands it to Draco. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIf you hold that against the parts that hurt worst it might help.\u201d He says, trying not to look as Draco unfolds the blanket and towel to press the water bottle against his belly. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to go change.\u201d He says gesturing at the door to the bathroom with the fresh set of clothes in his hand.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco doesn\u2019t respond, and Harry shuts the bathroom door behind him with a soft click. He leans back against the door with his eyes closed and presses the heel of his palm against his aching cock. \n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019d be inappropriate to wank right now, he knows, but merlin does he want to.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe straightens and sheds his wet clothes, replacing them with the pair of sweats and tshirt that Kreacher had brought him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe rubs a hand roughly over his face, takes a deep breath, and goes back into the room.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco is watching the door, but when Harry comes through it he glances away. Harry goes to the bedside and kneels down again. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHow are you feeling? Is it helping any?\u201d He asks, brushing some of Draco\u2019s hair out of his face.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco nods, but a moment later he tenses and bites his lip as a fresh wave of cramps and pain hit him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry can only watch and hope it passes soon, worried, frustrated, and unable to think of anything he can do to help.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen Draco\u2019s face relaxes again, and he releases his already rather abused looking lip, Harry leans in and kisses him gently. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry love.\u201d He says, voice rough with emotion. \u201cIs there anything you can think of that I can do to help?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco hesitates, glancing at Harry and away again, seeming to think over his answer. \n\n\u00a0\n\nEventually, as if he\u2019s giving in, he closes his eyes and in a quiet voice he asks.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWill you hold me?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOf course\u201d Harry replies. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s going to have to be careful about it, doesn\u2019t want to go poking Draco with anything that might make him uncomfortable, but he\u2019ll manage if Draco thinks it might help. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe climbs onto the bed, behind Draco who stays on his side facing away from Harry, curled around the hot water bottle, and pulls him close to his chest. Their positioning reminds Harry of how they lay when he\u2019s knotted Draco, only now he keeps his hips well away.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco sighs happily and snuggles back against him and Harry\u2019s heart feels like it does a somersault. He nuzzles his nose against Draco\u2019s neck and into his hair, and presses kisses all along Draco\u2019s neck and jaw, wanting him to be able to feel how loved he is.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry\u2019s not sure how long they lay like that, Harry trying to hug and kiss Draco through any pains, but somehow during this time Draco\u2019s hips have drifted back towards Harry\u2019s and as Draco shifts again Harry feels the faintest brush of Draco\u2019s towel covered ass against Harry\u2019s pajama clothed erection. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry grips Draco\u2019s hip to still him and bites down a moan. His body wants him to press forward, to seek out more of that warmth and friction and pressure, but he reminds himself, Draco does not want that. He will do whatever it takes to prove himself worthy of the trust Draco placed in him when he let Harry in.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSorry.\u201d Draco says, sounding miserable, his hip still twitching slightly in Harry\u2019s grasp. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cS fine.\u201d Harry says, reminded that he isn\u2019t the only one struggling with this. \n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco is in heat, and while his heats do seem to work differently than what is typical, he had been hard every time Harry had looked, so that part at least\u2026 seems to be the same as what you would expect. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWhich gives Harry an idea.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDraco, I know you don\u2019t want to have sex, and that\u2019s fine.\u201d Harry says, rushing to reassure when Draco tenses at his words. \u201cBut have you ever tried\u2026 y\u2019know\u2026 wanking?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just, that sort of thing can be\u2026 relaxing afterwards right? So I dunno, maybe it\u2019d help?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe presses his burning face against Draco\u2019s shoulder, cursing his apparent inability to think before speaking. \n\n\u00a0\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem like Draco will respond, and Harry almost feels grateful, he doesn\u2019t need any further confirmation that he\u2019s an idiot because of course, of course, that would have been something Draco would have already considered. Not necessarily for relaxation purposes maybe, but Draco would have surely tried wanking at some point during one of his past heats, and if it had been helpful or nice surely Draco would have got to it already.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco\u2019s arm, which is wrapped around the one Harry has draped across Draco\u2019s chest, tightens, and he traces invisible patterns on Harry\u2019s wrist with his thumb nervously. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry\u2019s about to try again to reassure that whatever Draco thinks is best is fine, that it was just a stupid idea, but Draco speaks first.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I can.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry says, concern and confusion building. \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry blushes when he remembers a chapter of one of the books he\u2019d read on omegas that had talked about heat aids, tools to simulate being knotted that unmated omegas would use to help them through their heats. \n\n\u00a0\n\nMerlin, Harry hadn\u2019t even thought to order anything like that, he hadn\u2019t thought they\u2019d need it, and he can\u2019t imagine any store having that sort of thing just\u2026 in stock. What if Draco needs something like that though? What would he do? He tries to think of omegas he knows that he can ask, but the only one coming to mind in this moment is Mrs Weasley and he\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019ll die if he has to talk about this sort of thing with her.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just\u2026 I\u2019m not good at it.\u201d Draco says, face now buried in the pillow, stopping Harry\u2019s runaway thoughts in their tracks. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Harry asks. \n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco shrugs.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDraco, I\u2019m sorry I know this is\u2026 uncomfortable\u2026 but I just\u2026 I don\u2019t understand.\u201d Harry says. \u201cI want to help if I can but.. I need to understand what you mean first.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco buries his face deeper into the pillow, and Harry doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s going to get an answer but a moment later Draco flops over onto his back and covers his eyes with his arm, looking defeated. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2026 always feel\u2026 bad... when I try. Ashamed.\u201d Draco says. \u201cIt never\u2026 I never get anywhere with it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNever?\u201d Harry asks, throat feeling dry.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco doesn\u2019t respond, but Harry can see him grimace under his arm. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHow have you managed to get through so many heats without ever\u2026?\u201d Harry asks. \n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco uncovers his eyes and looks at Harry in confusion, and Harry feels like he\u2019s missed something obvious.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOmegas in heat are worth more\u201d Draco says, like its some simple fact of life. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cEven whiny bitches like me.\u201d Draco adds, the self loathing practically dripping from his voice, before he turns back on to his side, facing away from Harry again.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry tightens his arms around Draco pulling them as close together as he can, arousal completely forgotten in the face of this. He kisses and licks their bond mark, wanting to just sink his teeth in and reassure both of them that Draco is here now, that he is Harry\u2019s and that Harry is going to love and treasure him forever, but he also needs his mouth to speak.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDraco, Draco I\u2019m so sorry. Draco you\u2019re not\u2026 you\u2019re not that\u2026 and it's\u2026 you told Hermione that sort of thing hurts when you\u2019re in heat\u2026 it\u2019s horrible that they made you still\u2026 do that sort of thing anyway.\u201d Harry says, still holding Draco\u2019s tense form close to him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe kisses and nips at the bond mark, desperately trying to comfort his mate, and eventually Draco gives in to the onslaught of affection and relaxes against him. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThey lay quietly for a while, both lost in their own thoughts. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI bet you\u2019re a great wanker.\u201d Draco says suddenly, out of the blue. Harry is too shocked and happy by the hint of Draco\u2019s old humor in his tone to be offended at being called a wanker.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh yeah, I\u2019m a great big tosser.\u201d He says, grinning.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco glances back at him with a smile, and Harry\u2019s heart skips a beat.\n\n\u00a0\n\nA moment later though he can feel Draco\u2019s muscles tensing under his arm and Draco grimaces in pain.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry lets out a concerned noise and kisses Draco\u2019s neck and bond mark, trying to be as comforting as possible. When the pain passes, Draco sighs and adjusts his head so Harry has better access to his neck. Harry gladly continues to kiss and suck and lick.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco gasps and shivers when Harry nips at their bond mark, and Harry can feel warmth pooling in his abdomen again.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat- what do you think about\u2026 when you\u2026 you know?\u201d Draco asks breathily. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou.\u201d Harry says, without hesitation. \u201cAlways you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco shivers, his hand twitching where its holding Harry\u2019s wrist, almost like it wants to move elsewhere\u2026\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou can if you want to.\u201d He says. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with wanking, and I love the sounds you make when you feel good, Draco.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco groans, and his hand leaves Harry\u2019s wrist to travel downward. Harry shifts his hips away from Draco, knowing he wont be able to keep them still if Draco makes any more amazing noises.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco shivers, but he\u2019s biting his lip again, and his face doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s enjoying himself. Harry presses a kiss to their bond mark.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cRelax Draco,\u201d he says, letting his lips brush against Draco\u2019s feverish skin, \u201cyou\u2019re doing fine. Just enjoy yourself.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco whimpers, and Harry can see the blanket moving where Draco is pulling himself off. Harry groans, but tries to muffle it by kissing Draco\u2019s neck again. \n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco\u2019s thoughts seem to start to get off track again whenever Harry is quiet for too long, so eventually Harry is just rambling and hoping he\u2019s saying the right things.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re so amazing Draco. So wonderful.\u201d Harry says. \u201cLook at you, being so good, doing just what I asked you to.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco whimpers at that, and Harry has noticed how he seems to like being praised so he leans into that.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSuch a good boy.\u201d He says, and he feels something brush his hip. He realizes with a start that it\u2019s Draco\u2019s hand reaching behind himself to finger at his entrance.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMerlin, he can hear how wet Draco is. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry muffles a whimper in Draco\u2019s neck, his hips rocking to no avail. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMy good boy Draco. My mate, my love.\u201d He rambles on.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco\u2019s whole body seizes up, and he comes with a whine. Harry bites his own lip painfully to regain control of himself, and then he kisses their bond mark.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSuch a good boy, you were amazing.\u201d Harry says. \n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco doesn\u2019t respond, and Harry realizes that he\u2019s already asleep. \n\n\n.::Harry::.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey get through Draco\u2019s heat somehow, though Harry\u2019s not entirely sure how. Thankfully, it seems Draco\u2019s heats tend to be on the shorter end of the spectrum and only last a few days rather than a full week like some. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry is grateful, he\u2019s not sure he could have survived a full week. \n\n\u00a0\n\nIt ends some time when Harry is managing to get a bit of sleep, and when he wakes up to Draco sitting on his cock he nearly blacks out from how good it feels after days of being turned on with no relief. \n\n\u00a0\n\nEven both exhausted as they are by having just survived Draco\u2019s first heat since they\u2019ve been mates, they manage to have sex three times that day.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco seems to be doing better now also. He\u2019d been tired and worn out the first few days afterwards but he also seems\u2026 more comfortable, around Harry now, and it makes Harry\u2019s heart swell with happiness every time he notices. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe is just thinking he should start dinner when he hears a loud crash and a shattering of dishes from the kitchen. \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nRealizing with worry that he has no idea where in the house Draco is, Harry rushes to the kitchen. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe first thing he sees when he enters the kitchen is Ginny. She\u2019s staring at something, and holding her hand out like she\u2019s trying to calm some wild animal. He follows her gaze across the kitchen and, over by the stove, spots Draco, who looks terrified. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry moves quickly to his mate, wrapping his arms around Draco and putting himself in between him and the other alpha in the room. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSorry Harry.\u201d Ginny says from across the room. \u201cDidn\u2019t mean to startle him.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry nods in response but his focus is still on Draco who is clinging to him and shaking.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay Draco.\u201d He says quietly, nuzzling against the top of Draco\u2019s head and trying to calm him. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You\u2019re okay. I\u2019ve got you, I\u2019m not going to let anyone hurt you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco swallows several times, and his eyes look glassy, but he seems to be regaining his composure. His hands drop from where they had been tangled in Harry\u2019s shirt, and after several deep breaths he stops shivering. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry kisses the top of his head, then glances for the first time at the mess around them. A large tray, several broken dishes, and\u2026\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDid you make treacle tart?\u201d Harry asks incredulously.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco blushes and looks away with a shrug. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry beams at him. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s incredible Draco.\u201d Harry says, kissing him on the cheek. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you could do that, you\u2019re so talented.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco doesn\u2019t respond but his blush spreads to his ears and down his neck.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAw\u201d Ginny says, still on the other side of the room, \u201cyou guys are so cute.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco tenses when she speaks, and Harry squeezes him a bit tighter. He turns to look at Ginny, and feels Draco huddle close to his back, practically hiding behind him.\n\n\nDraco really is very uncomfortable around other alphas, Harry thinks. He\u2019ll need to make sure to let everyone know that unexpected visits are no longer welcome, he doesn\u2019t want Draco feeling unsafe in his own home.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey Gin, what\u2019s up?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMmm I\u2019m on a break from team stuff and mum wanted me to bring this stuff by.\u201d She says gesturing lazily at a large basket that looks full to the brim with homemade foods. \u201cI swear she\u2019s convinced that any of us that don\u2019t live at home will starve if she doesn\u2019t send us food.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNot that you need it.\u201d Ginny continues with a smirk. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a house elf and a cute little omega to make you food.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe feels Draco grab his shirt tightly, and glances back at him, but Draco\u2019s staring at the floor, so Harry can\u2019t read his expression.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s honestly not fair.\u201d Ginny says with a joking pout. \u201cYou really should learn to share.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nFuck.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco tenses behind him, and Harry can practically feel his fear.\n\n\u00a0\n\nGinny\u2019s a great friend, and Harry knows she is just joking around, and that she would never be joking like this if she knew about Draco\u2019s past but\u2026 Draco does not know this. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry tries to think of the best way to handle this.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh fuck off Gin\u201d He says, trying for a similar joking tone. \u201cThis one\u2019s mine, and I\u2019m keeping him.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe reaches behind him and pulls Draco forward, wrapping an arm around him and hugging him close. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe even made me treacle tart, Gin.\u201d Harry says. \u201cTreacle tart.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah... he\u2019s pretty jumpy... but I reckon he\u2019s a keeper.\u201d Ginny says with a genuine smile.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco seems to be picking up on the fact that Ginny was joking, and he leans into Harry more. Harry kisses his cheek, giving his shoulder a squeeze.\n\n\u00a0\n\nGinny\u2019s pouting again now. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh honestly,\u201d she says, with no real heat to her words, \u201cyou two are worse than Ron and Hermione.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m leaving, I\u2019m too single for this.\u201d She says as she heads back to the kitchen floo. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMaybe you wouldn\u2019t be so single if you spent less time on quidditch and more time looking for a partner.\u201d Harry says jokingly.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou sound just like mum.\u201d Ginny says, flipping him off. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe moment she\u2019s gone he turns to Draco, cupping his cheek and turning his face towards him. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d He asks, worriedly. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco looks at him for a moment then shakes his head no.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHis eyes drift down to the floor and over to the mess of broken dishes.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Draco says dejectedly.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. You have nothing to be sorry for.\u201d Harry insists. \u201cI\u2019m sorry she scared you, I should have told her not to come by unless I said it was okay, I didn\u2019t think.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry she made you uncomfortable.\u201d He continues. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know\u2026 and she doesn\u2019t always think things through.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco still looks miserable so Harry tries to think of how to cheer him up.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI still can\u2019t believe you made treacle tart, that\u2019s amazing.\u201d He says. He\u2019d always been shit at baking, and he hadn\u2019t expected Draco to have any cooking experience.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI ruined it though. And I broke your dishes.\u201d Draco says, still sounding upset with himself.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, and it\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d Harry says. \u201cI\u2019ll have Kreacher clean up the mess, and if you\u2019re still craving treacle tart we can go out and get some.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.::Draco::.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco had wanted to surprise Harry. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019d been so good to Draco, during his heat. He hadn\u2019t fucked Draco once during his heat despite how much he clearly wanted to, and Draco had never had a heat with so little pain. So, Draco had wanted to do something for Harry. Something special.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe doesn\u2019t have much to offer though.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt was Kreacher, actually, who came up with the idea, mentioning not so casually to Draco that Harry likes treacle tart. It was Kreacher, also, who had acquired the recipe book, after assuring Draco several times that it was fine and that he had a budget for such things when he\u2019d do Harry\u2019s shopping.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo really, Draco hadn\u2019t done all that much. Just followed the recipe, which was really quite easy compared to some of the finicky potions Draco had brewed in the past.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut despite how little he had to do, he\u2019s still managed to mess it up.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019d just gathered everything onto a serving tray, and was getting ready to take it up to Harry, when Weasley\u2019s sister suddenly came through the floo.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019d dropped the tray in his surprise, and then the fear had set in.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe had wondered about her, about why Harry isn\u2019t with her instead of doing whatever it is he is doing with Draco, but the moment she steps into the kitchen he knows.\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe is an alpha too. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe is glad when she leaves, glad when Harry\u2019s attention turns fully back to him, irrationally jealous of her even still. Then he sees properly, for the first time, the mess he has made, and he feels his heart sink again.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe can\u2019t even properly hear what Harry is saying anymore, and he feels his eyes stinging like he might actually cry. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe used to cry a lot, and honestly that should have been a hint as to what he would present as but he had been too proud to see. He had learned not to cry, over anything, he\u2019d learned that there is no point to such foolishness. But Potter it seems, is still excellent at making Draco lose control, and now he is barely stopping himself from crying over some stupid destroyed pastries.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe feels a warm hand on his cheek, turning his head to face Harry\u2019s. He doesn\u2019t look at him, sure he will fall to pieces if he does.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry kisses him.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDraco, you\u2019re okay.\u201d Harry says. \u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco closes his eyes and leans into the hand on his cheek. He has to swallow several times to push down the emotions threatening to overcome him.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHere c\u2019mon, I have something for you.\u201d Harry says, and Draco follows numbly when Harry takes his hand and leads him up to the study.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco watches distantly as Harry digs around in a desk drawer.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe straightens a moment later, turning back to Draco and holding a plain narrow box.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco\u2019s breath catches in his throat, it can\u2019t be.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSorry I didn\u2019t give it back sooner.\u201d Potter says sheepishly\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen Harry hands him the box, Draco takes it with shaking fingers. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI just\u2026 I wasn\u2019t sure at first\u2026 and then I didn\u2019t know when would be a good time\u2026\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco opens the box, and inside is a wand. His wand. The one Harry had taken back at the manor, during the war.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe feels the tears on his cheeks before he even has a chance to try and stop them.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe takes the wand with shaking fingers, clutches it to his chest. He hasn\u2019t been allowed to have a wand since\u2026 since the people who had taken him from the battlefield had destroyed the borrowed one he had been using\u2026 and this\u2026 this is \n\nhis\n\n wand. His. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWith his wand in his hands he feels more whole than he has in a very long time.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry pulls him into his warm arms, and Draco\u2019s not sure how long he cries.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.::Draco::.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco taps his shirt with his wand again, and watches in the mirror as the color changes.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFrowning he taps it again, and again the color shifts.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s spending far too long on this, the healers won\u2019t care what color shirt he wears, but he\u2019s nervous and he doesn\u2019t have anything useful he can do so\u2026\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen the time to leave comes, he apparates to the kitchen. He\u2019s been using magic excessively lately, for things he really doesn\u2019t need to use it for, but... he\u2019s just so happy to be able to use it again he can\u2019t seem to stop himself from using it at every opportunity.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPotter gives him a look of fond exasperation but doesn\u2019t comment.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cReady?\u201d Potter asks.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNo, would be the honest answer. Draco nods \u2018yes\u2019.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPotter pulls him close and kisses him on the top of his head.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019d been persistent, and Draco, resolve weakened by too much good treatment and the fact that he had a wand now, had given in easily.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere is no point to seeing a healer, he\u2019d been seen by healers before, but if Harry insists on wasting time\u2026 Draco will let him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis healer would come to the same conclusions that the others had.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNothing to be done, nothing wrong with him, Draco just makes a big fuss over something that other omegas go through without complaint every day.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco tries not to look up as they leave the house to apparate to St. Mungos. He\u2019d tried going in the back garden the other day, and even enclosed as it is by a high stone fence he\u2019d felt dizzy at the amount of space stretching above him. So he keeps his eyes down and holds on to Potter tightly.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOnce they\u2019re outside the wards, Potter apparates them to St. Mungos.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhile Potter handles the check in, Draco continues to hold onto his arm and pointedly ignores the witch behind the desk. He really can\u2019t handle being jealous of some receptionist on top of everything else. This place makes him uncomfortable, reminds him of when he\u2019d been brought here by aurors, and he tries not to be too obvious about pressing his nose against Potter\u2019s shoulder, breathing in and letting the alpha\u2019s scent comfort him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey don\u2019t have to wait long before they are called back to a private room.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen the healer enters, a short beta with her hair pulled back into a severe bun, Draco tries to tune out her conversation with Potter as much as possible.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAs much as he knows what is coming, he is still not looking forward to what the healer will have to say. He knows he\u2019s pathetic, but that doesn\u2019t mean he likes to hear it said yet again.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDraco\u201d Potter says softly to him, squeezing his shoulder lightly. \u201cIt\u2019s probably best if you answer these questions, you\u2019d know better than me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco takes a few deep breaths, trying to steel himself. Then he nods.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe healer clearly knows about Draco\u2019s background and Draco wonders vaguely if she was on his case. He remembers none of the hospital staff from his time here then, so for all he knows she could have been. Her questions are uncomfortable, to say the least. She asks about every little detail, no matter how terrible or embarrassing. He tries to answer them detachedly, giving just the bare minimum facts whenever possible.\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe takes notes, and somehow, Draco thinks, that makes it worse. He doesn\u2019t like the thought that somewhere there\u2019s going to be a record of this.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAnd what about this last heat? The most recent one.\u201d She says finally.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco hesitates.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt had for some reason been weirdly easier to talk about his past, then to talk about his present situation.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t hurt as much.\u201d Draco says eventually, going with the truth.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nPotter shifts next to him, but he doesn\u2019t remove his arm from around Draco\u2019s shoulder, for which Draco is grateful. He can\u2019t look at Potter or the healer and he can feel a blush blooming on his cheeks.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d Says the healer, sounding interested. \u201cAnd what was different about this one?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe doesn\u2019t know how to answer the question, he doesn\u2019t really understand it himself.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut something about Potter\u2019s presence, the things he did, or how he handled things had eased the pain gradually. In fact, towards the end, the pain had gotten so much less and the horrible empty feeling that had persisted throughout his heat had gotten so bad, that he had almost decided to just ask Harry to knot him anyway, even if it did hurt. But his heat had ended before he had come to a decision, so he hadn\u2019t had the chance to find out if it would be worth it.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. A lot was different. He was there.\u201d Draco manages, and he is relieved when the Healer shifts her inquisitive gaze to Potter.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWell, Mr. Potter, what are your recollections of the events?\u201d The healer asks.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cUmm\u2026\u201d Potter stumbles \u201cwell\u2026 Draco described the pains like\u2026 muscle cramps, so I tried to treat them like you would muscle cramps from sports or something.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe healer nods, and Potter continues on sounding uncomfortable.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo lots of warm baths and massages and rest.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI see.\u201d The healer says, taking notes again. \u201cAnd how many times did you knot him?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nPotter tenses, Draco still can\u2019t handle looking at him but he\u2019s sure he\u2019s got to be blushing at this point, Draco certainly is.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cUmm\u2026 none?\u201d Potter says. \u201cDraco said that being knotted hurts when he is in heat, so umm\u2026 we didn\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe healer hmms and writes more.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAnd Draco, were you able to reach orgasm without being knotted?\u201d The healer asks, not looking up from her notes where she is still writing quickly.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco\u2019s face burns.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe manages a nod, which thankfully the healer sees because he doesn\u2019t think he could speak past his embarrassment right now.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay, and how many orgasms did you have?\u201d The healer asks, like she\u2019s asking what he had for breakfast.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI.. I don\u2019t know.\u201d Draco says, unable to recall anything useful past his mortification.\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe glances at Potter who hesitates for a moment before answering.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cEleven.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nMerlin, Draco wishes the floor would just open up and swallow him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe room is quiet for a few minutes while the healer reviews her notes. Potter presses his nose against Draco\u2019s hair and Draco can feel the tension in the arm around his shoulder.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWell then,\u201d She says eventually, \u201cFrom what you\u2019ve both said, it sounds as if Draco may have some sort of hormonal imbalance or condition that is causing these unusual symptoms.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe good news is that these things are not typically that serious, and we should be able to get you some regular medication that should relieve the unpleasant symptoms.\u201d She says, kindly. \u201cThe bad news is that first we have to run some tests, confirm my theory and figure out what exactly is wrong so we can treat you appropriately. And that is going to take some time.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take a blood sample today, and we should be able to get you the results in a week or so.\u201d She continues. \u201cBecause of how recently your last heat was, it seems unlikely that you will have another before we get your results but just in case you do, I advise you to try to handle things the way you did the last time as it sounds like that helped.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco feels thunderstruck, and hardly registers anything as they leave.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis, this could actually be a real thing? A real confirmable medical condition? It might not have just been him being unable to handle things everyone else could?\n\n\u00a0\n\nPotter pulls him into a tight hug the moment they step through the door of Grimmauld place, and Draco lets himself relax into the embrace.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.::Harry::.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Harry asks, still holding his mate tightly in their entrance hall.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe had been relieved by the healer\u2019s confirmation that whatever is going on with Draco, that it probably isn\u2019t serious. But Draco had seemed shocked, and he has been silent and absent since.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe doesn\u2019t understand Draco\u2019s reaction, but he wants to comfort him anyway.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Draco says eventually, quietly. \u201cI\u2019ve never\u2026 no healer has ever believed it was actually\u2026 actually something before.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe holds Draco tighter, his heart aching as he remembers Draco\u2019s words during his heat. He had called himself a \u2018whiney bitch\u2019 and Harry wonders how many times he had been told that that is what he is.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe doesn\u2019t know what to say, so he holds Draco, one arm around his waist and one hand holding the back of his neck, and tries to reassure him as best he can.\n\n\u00a0\n\nEventually Draco pulls away slightly and asks if Harry wants him to make dinner.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco has been helping out with cooking since the treacle tart incident, and Harry is pleased. Harry knows how to cook fairly decently, but mostly just meals his Aunt Petunia had had him make. Draco has had Kreacher pick him up some recipe books, and he has so far proven himself capable of making any of the dishes in them.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIf you want.\u201d Harry says. \u201cCan I help though?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey make dinner together, with Draco taking the lead and correcting Harry gently whenever he is doing something wrong.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s not until later, much later, when they are snuggled close together in Harry\u2019s tangled bedsheets, that the subject of what happened with the Healer is brought up again.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDid\u2026 did it really help?\u201d Harry asks, quietly. \u201cDuring your heat\u2026\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Draco says, also speaking quietly in the dark room.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAt first, it was like all the other times\u2026 but then it got\u2026 less. It got easier.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nRelieved, Harry presses his lips to the bond mark.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n.::Harry::.\n\n\nA week later sees them back at the healer\u2019s for the results of Draco\u2019s tests. Harry\u2019s stomach is twisted up in knots as they sit in the room, waiting for the healer to arrive to talk it over with them. Draco is tucked under his arm, and he looks calm, his face blank\u2026 almost bored looking, but Harry can feel the tension in his shoulders, the slight tremor in the hand holding his.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen the healer enters, Harry searches her face for any hint of what is to come, but her calm professionalism reveals nothing.\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe sits across from them, arranges her notebook and quill and then looks up at them.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo how have you both been? Any new developments since I saw you last?\u201d She asks them, quill poised.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry looks to Draco, but then shakes his head \u2018no\u2019 when he can tell Draco isn\u2019t going to answer her himself.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe healer smiles kindly at them, and thankfully moves right on to the reason they are there.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo as you both know, we ran some tests on a blood sample provided by Mr. Malfoy.\u201d She says, and Harry holds his breath. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t find any hormonal issues, and all the tests we ran came back normal.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry feels Draco\u2019s shoulders sink in defeat under his arm and he pulls him closer, pressing a kiss into his hair.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBut given the reported symptoms, I felt there must be something I was missing so I went back and reviewed your file again Mr. Malfoy\u201d The healer continues, possibly noting that the lack of results had upset both of them. \u201cAnd I believe I found the cause.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry swallows, she had said the hormone things were usually not serious, but this\u2026 this could be anything.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAs you know for your legal case a bond scan was performed.\u201d She says, and Harry doesn\u2019t know where she\u2019s going with this. \u201cAnd upon further study of the results it seems that, at that time, you were under more than one bond.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry\u2019s throat feels dry.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Draco asks, barely a whisper, his eyes wide and fear written across his face.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very uncommon, but it does happen sometimes.\u201d She says. \u201cOccasionally with very strong bonds, new ones can\u2019t\u2026 take\u2026 if they aren\u2019t strong enough of a connection. Very rarely this can result in the new bond forming but being unable to completely get rid of the old one.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt seems that that is likely what happened.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry\u2019s mind is whirling, trying to process all of this.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIs\u2026 is the other bond still active?\u201d he asks, and Draco tenses further.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d The healer says firmly. \u201cI checked with the blood sample Mr. Malfoy provided at the last appointment, he now only has his bond to you Mr. Potter.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cCan you trace who the other bond was with?\u201d Harry asks, and he hears a sharp intake of breath from Draco but he doesn\u2019t look, he can\u2019t look.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s not sure what expression will be on Draco\u2019s face, and Harry\u2019s not sure he can handle it if he sees that Draco wants to pursue this other bond. This very rare, very powerful bond.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cUnfortunately no\u201d the healer says, \u201cthe trace of it was so faint on the scan, there\u2019s no way to get a magical signature. That\u2019s likely why it was missed the first time, if no one was looking for something like this, it can be easy to miss\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nYears, Draco must have been bonded to this person for years. Despite who knows how many other bond marks had been forced on him, that bond had held on.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry couldn\u2019t blame Draco if he wanted to explore that possibility, but the thought of having to let him go\u2026\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBut\u2026 but that doesn\u2019t make any sense!\u201d Draco says, suddenly speaking up.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry looks at him, and all he can see is how upset and confused he is.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always, always been like this.\u201d Draco says, voice trembling. \u201cBut the first time I\u2019d never been marked, and this most recent time\u2026 you said I only had the one bond this time.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWell, with this last time\u2026 Omega\u2019s aren\u2019t supposed to be under more than one bond, and you were... likely for years, it\u2019s going to take your body some time to adjust.\u201d The healer explains patiently. \u201cYou said it was better this time? Easier? It\u2019ll probably continue to get easier, your body just has to adjust to not fighting itself over who it should want.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAnd as for the first time\u2026 I\u2019ll be honest that I don\u2019t really know.\u201d She says, and Draco makes a very frustrated noise. Harry would be feeling proud of how emotional and vocal he\u2019s being if he himself wasn\u2019t already feeling so emotionally wrecked by all of this.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThere are some cases, stories really, you have to understand this sort of thing is so rare, of bonds being formed without there necessarily being a\u2026 a bite involved.\u201d The healer continues tentatively. \u201cThere\u2019s next to no research on the subject, again it is \n\nextremely \n\nrare, but\u2026\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt seems in some cases, cases where the pair is very compatible, and there are extenuating circumstances, and some other magical scar is made while the pair is in contact\u2026 sometimes that\u2019s enough for the bonding magic.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.::Draco::.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey return home in silence, and Draco\u2019s not sure when he started referring to Potter\u2019s house as home but\u2026\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe dark expression on Potter\u2019s face makes him nervous, and reminds him he shouldn\u2019t be letting his guard down in these ways.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe moment they step inside and shed their outer layers, Potter is on him, crowding Draco against the wall, wrapping him in his arms, and pressing his nose to Draco\u2019s neck.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe doesn\u2019t kiss him, or grope, or ask Draco to go to bed with him and for a moment Draco is confused, but then it clicks.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAlpha\u2019s are notoriously possessive of their omegas, and they have just spent the last hour discussing Draco having been bonded to other people.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPotter needs reassurance.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco doesn\u2019t really know how to offer that.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe tries his best anyway, tilting his head more to the side, giving Potter better access to his neck and his bond mark. He then tentatively brings his hands up to Potter\u2019s hips, not pulling or pushing\u2026 just... holding on.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPotter takes a shuddery breath and squeezes Draco tighter briefly before releasing him and lifting his head to try to look Draco in the eye. Draco can\u2019t meet Potter\u2019s stare, but he resists the urge to turn his face away or hide.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDo you\u2026 do you want to try to find whoever you had that bond with?\u201d Potter asks, and Draco\u2019s heart feels like it stops, alarm flooding through him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe glances over Potter\u2019s face with wide eyes, and the alpha looks pained.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Draco says firmly.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Potter asks, and the words sound like he has to force them out.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure.\u201d Draco says. \u201cI... I just want you. Only you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nPotter groans and buries his face against Draco\u2019s neck again. He seems placated, for now,\u00a0 but Draco still feels scared and jittery, desperate to prove his loyalty to Harry, desperate to not get himself sent away.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cPlease\u2026\u201d Draco asks, his voice shaking slightly. \u201cPlease knot me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nPotter lifts his head and looks at Draco in concern, searching his face for something that Draco hopes desperately is there.\n\n\u00a0\n\nUnable to handle the scrutiny any longer he pushes himself up on his toes and presses his lips to Potter\u2019s. Potter doesn\u2019t return the kiss.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco can't stop the panicked noise that escapes him as he pulls away.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThat Potter reacts to, tightening his arms around Draco and looking even more concerned.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s comforting. Today has been\u2026\u201d Draco admits reluctantly.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cPlease.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nPotter searches his face for a moment longer before he responds.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nLater, much later, when they are sweaty and tied together on Potter\u2019s bed, and he can hear Potter snoring gently behind him, only then does Draco let himself acknowledge the small burn scar on his ankle that\u2019s been itching ever since the healer had said that a bond didn\u2019t necessarily need a bite.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe fact is, there is only one alpha he\u2019d been in contact with that day in a way that could have possibly caused a bond to form.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd that alpha had been Potter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.::Harry::.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHarry, it\u2019s been weeks. He misses you.\u201d Andromeda says, her face flickering with the green flames of the floo.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI know, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Harry says, feeling incredibly guilty. \u201cI\u2019ll come over-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to have to meet sometime.\u201d Andromeda says, cutting him off.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry knows this, but\u2026\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI know you have your reasons for being reluctant to introduce them.\u201d Andromeda says, her voice softening. \u201cBut they\u2019re family. And we could all use some more family these days.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry swallows, she has a point but-\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m dropping him off in a half an hour. So if you have any preparations you need to make I suggest you make them.\u201d Andromeda says, voice backed with steel and not giving Harry a chance to respond before ending the call.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cShit.\u201d Harry mutters to the now empty hearth.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019d developed a good relationship with the older woman since the war due to their mutual interest in Teddy\u2019s wellbeing but\u2026\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s times like these that Harry\u2019s reminded of Andromeda\u2019s other relatives.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe scrubs his hands over his face, and mutters some more curse words, before standing. He needs to find Draco, give him a heads up.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe finds Draco in the library, like he had expected. Draco\u2019s a voracious reader it seems, and it occurs to him that maybe he should try to invite him to go to a bookstore sometime\u2026 but then again he always seems reluctant to leave the house and had turned down all of Harry\u2019s past offers for anything outside the house aside from the healer\u2019s visits.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry clears his throat to let Draco, who is caught up in his reading, know that he\u2019s there.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco blinks up at him, eyes sweeping over him before he averts them. Harry knows he has his attention now though.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cUm\u2026\u201d Harry starts sheepishly \u201csorry for the short notice but my godson is coming over. He\u2019ll be here in around twenty minutes.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco tenses.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t\u2026 you don't have to do anything.\u201d He clarifies. \u201cI can keep him restricted to downstairs if you\u2019d like\u2026\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe takes a deep breath.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBut if you\u2019re okay with it I\u2019m sure he\u2019d love to meet you.\u201d Harry says. He wants Draco to be okay with it. He\u2019s terrified, Teddy isn\u2019t the most tactful of kids and Harry\u2019s so scared Teddy will say something that will hurt Draco but\u2026\n\n\u00a0\n\nIf he\u2019s honest he\u2019s kind of grateful to Andromeda for not giving him the option to continue putting this off. He doesn\u2019t want to put it off any more, but he knows he would have if it\u2019d been left up to him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco is quiet for a while, and Harry hopes he\u2019s just thinking things over and hasn\u2019t decided to just not respond.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m not good with kids.\u201d Draco admits finally, sounding resigned.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s not really the response Harry expects.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHas Draco even had any experience with kids? He wonders. He sounds like he\u2019s expecting to be reprimanded for this admission, and Harry tries to think through how to reassure him that he will not be.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat- that\u2019s okay.\u201d He says, going for a light hearted tone and stumbling over his words slightly. \u201cTeddy\u2019s not too great with people. You\u2019ll make a great pair.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe means it to reassure Draco, a joking way to say Draco won\u2019t be alone in his awkwardness, but it falls flat. Draco just looks even more tense and resigned.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s okay.\u201d Harry says, kneeling down in front of Draco and putting a hand on his knee in a way he hopes is reassuring.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou really don\u2019t have to meet him if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d Harry says, \u201cAnd if you do meet him, you\u2019re welcome to keep it as short as you want. He\u2019s\u2026\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry trails off trying to think of how to word this.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI love him but Teddy\u2019s... very... direct. It can be a bit much sometimes.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco swallows and Harry wonders if this conversation is over.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat\u2026 what if I do something wrong?\u201d Draco asks, quietly.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe wants to pull Draco into a kiss, but he resists, instead taking Draco\u2019s hands in his own.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAre you going to hurt him?\u201d Harry asks calmly, knowing the answer but wanting Draco to understand.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco looks at him sharply, surprise and alarm written clearly on his face.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo. I would never-\u201d Draco says in a rush.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry squeezes his hands reassuringly.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThen it\u2019s going to be fine.\u201d He says.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco\u2019s quiet again a moment, and Harry can see him working to regain his composure.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat if\u2026 what if he asks about-\u201d here Draco gestures vaguely at the scars on his neck.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry uses his thumbs to trace circles against the backs of Draco\u2019s hands.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe probably will.\u201d He admits. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to respond however you feel is best.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco almost looks like he\u2019s going to bring up some other issue, but then the chiming of the doorbell echoes throughout the house.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.::Draco::.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nPotter was right about one thing.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWoah you have a lot of scars!\u201d is the first thing to come out of the kid\u2019s mouth when he spots Draco, who is definitely not hiding by the stairs trying to watch without being seen.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco panics at the comment, and at having been caught, and he considers just turning tail and going to his rooms, but the broad grin that Potter sends his way makes him feel rooted to the spot.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI have a scar too.\u201d The child says, bounding over to Draco excitedly. \u201cWant to see?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco once again considers fleeing, but Potter\u2019s watching him still and he looks\u2026\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe looks so happy.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco manages to nod, and crouches down so he\u2019s on the same level as the boy. The kid excitedly pulls up his own sleeve to proudly show Draco a barely there scar on his forearm. He then launches into an excited and dramatic retelling of his encounter with a particularly angry garden gnome at the Weasley\u2019s.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco tries to pay attention to the story, he really does, but he is thoroughly distracted as the child\u2019s hair gradually shifts from the light brown it had been when he\u2019d arrived to a vibrant Weasley orange.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco glances to Potter, worried that somehow he has caused this, but Potter doesn\u2019t seem bothered. He comes up to them and casually ruffles the kid\u2019s now fully ginger hair.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou hungry?\u201d Harry asks. The kid nods enthusiastically. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go find Kreacher and ask him for some sandwiches?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe kid lights up and excitedly runs off towards the kitchens.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco stands, trying to decide if it would be okay to ask about the hair. Harry pulls him into his arms, pressing his nose to Draco\u2019s hair and humming happily.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco tries not to be obvious about leaning into Harry\u2019s warmth, or that the wave of relief that he feels that it seems he hasn\u2019t messed up yet makes him feel a little light headed.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a metamorphmagi.\u201d Harry says, after a few moments. \u201cHis grandmother says he should get some more control over it as he gets older but for now it\u2019s mostly just his hair that changes and its usually subconscious.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d Draco says, that explains why Harry didn\u2019t react.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis sort of thing is probably normal for them. It must be a pain to keep track of him anywhere with a crowd, he finds himself thinking. He\u2019s not sure he could manage it, he feels panicky just at the thought.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe same curiosity that brought him to the bottom of the stairs earlier compels Draco to join Harry and Teddy in the kitchen for lunch.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nTeddy takes twice as long to eat as the two adults because he spends so much time animatedly talking to them about this and that. Harry responds occasionally, but Teddy doesn\u2019t seem to mind that Draco just nods instead of speaking.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAfter lunch, Teddy wants to play out back. Draco makes his excuses and heads up to his room instead of joining them, still not comfortable outdoors after spending so long exclusively inside and unsure how to explain it to Harry or the kid if that panic shows on his face.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe originally plans to read. But as soon as he sits in the armchair by the window his eyes are drawn down to the yard.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWatching Potter play with his godson in the shifting sunlight as the occasional cloud drifts overhead, reminds him somewhat of his thoughts that first night, especially as he sees Teddy\u2019s hair shift from orange to black to match Potter\u2019s.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe wants to turn away, read like he had planned, but he can\u2019t turn his eyes from the happy scene unfolding down below him. He should just be happy he hasn\u2019t messed things up, that he\u2019s not in trouble, but seeing Potter like this pokes at the ache in Draco\u2019s heart, and fills him with longing for things he knows he can\u2019t have.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n.::Harry::.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry leans back against the heavy front door of Grimmauld Place, and thinks to himself that a door shutting has never sounded so loud before.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe looks at Draco, who is standing silently in the entrance hall a little ways away from him. Draco\u2019s face is still completely closed off, and his body is rigid with tension. Harry wants to pull him into a hug, comfort him, but he\u2019s not sure that would be welcome given what they\u2019ve just found out.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019d been so worried when Draco had collapsed that afternoon, he had rushed his unconscious mate to St. Mungos. And when the healer had told them that Draco would be fine, that he was just pregnant and that his body was just trying to adjust, that this fainting spell wasn\u2019t that unexpected given that while Draco\u2019s health was improving, he\u2019d been severely malnourished not all that long ago\u2026\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry had had a moment of pure unencumbered joy, a moment of thrilled excitement... but then he\u2019d looked at Draco\u2026 and he\u2019d seen the fear and panic and\u2026 and... how much Draco does not want this. He\u2019d only seen it for a brief moment before Draco\u2019s expression had smoothed and gone carefully blank, so he can\u2019t be sure but\u2026\n\n\u00a0\n\nFuck. He\u2019d really fucked up.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe had just assumed that Draco would want kids, he\u2019d never thought to ask. He should have made sure they talked about this sort of thing before\u2026 before they\u2019d started having sex.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDraco.\u201d Harry says, his voice coming out hoarse. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco nods stiffly, and Harry leads him into the sitting room. Draco sinks wordlessly on to the couch, his back ramrod straight and his hands clenched in his lap. Harry debates for a moment before sitting on the floor in front of him.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe wants to stand, wants to pace, but he knows that that will make Draco uncomfortable and, fuck does he not want to make this any worse than it already is.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe pulls at the fibers of the rug beneath him as he tries to figure out what to say, staring at its intricate pattern without seeing it. He\u2019s still at a loss as to where to start when Draco speaks.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cPlease-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cPlease\u2026 don\u2019t make me get rid of it.\u201d His mate pleads. \u201cI\u2019ll- I\u2019ll do anything. Please.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry looks up sharply, and he sees that the mask is gone. Draco is crying openly, and he has his arms curled around his belly protectively.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry can feel his heart breaking for his mate and he is already sitting on the couch and pulling Draco into his arms before he\u2019s even realized he\u2019s decided to move.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDraco,\u201d Harry says, pressing his nose to the top of Draco\u2019s hair, \u201cOf course, of course you can keep it if you want to.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do anything you don\u2019t want to, Draco. If.. if you want to terminate the pregnancy you can..\u201d Draco sobs harder into Harry\u2019s shirt at this, and Harry squeezes him tighter. \u201cBut if you want to\u2026 to have this baby that\u2019s okay too.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhatever you want.\u201d Harry says.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry feels lost, he doesn\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on with Draco, and he doesn\u2019t know how to help.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI want\u2026 I want my baby.\u201d Draco says shakily, still crying, arms still wrapped around himself.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay, okay\u2026\u201d Harry says petting Draco\u2019s hair and rocking them both slowly. \u201cThen I will do everything I can to make it so.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt takes a long while before Draco calms enough to try talking again.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI'm sorry.\u201d he says sounding miserable.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou have nothing to be sorry about Draco.\u201d Harry insists. \u201cIm sorry, I should have talked to you about this sort of thing, instead of just assuming.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIts your body Draco, whatever you decide, I'll go along with.\u201d Harry doesn\u2019t want to say this, it\u2019s the truth\u2026 he\u2019d never force Draco to go through with something like this if he doesn\u2019t want to\u2026 but\u2026 still.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe hates that he\u2019s put them in this position where they\u2019re having this conversation now, instead of having had it when they should have.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco sounds resigned when he speaks up again.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHaving a kid with\u2026 with me will cause problems for you in the future, so if\u2026 if you wanted to send us away\u2026 that would be understandable\u2026\u201d Draco says, struggling over the words.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry\u2019s arms tighten around his mate.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhy on earth would I send\u2026\u201d he still can\u2019t refer to Draco\u2019s pregnancy as his kid yet, not when he\u2019s still half terrified that Draco doesn\u2019t want to have a kid, \u201c...you away?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe thought of being away from his mate is painful enough, Draco hasn\u2019t been back in Harry\u2019s life all that long but the thought of being without him for any extended period of time\u2026\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe can\u2019t imagine any scenario where he\u2019d want that, want to be away from his mate, away from their child.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2026 when you get a proper mate they won\u2019t like having us around, you\u2019ll probably-\u201d Draco starts, before Harry cuts him off.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cProper mate?\u201d Harry asks, only getting more confused and concerned as Draco speaks. \u201cDraco, \n\nyou\n\n are my mate.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco shrugs.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cFor now.\u201d he says, and Harry can hear the tears he is trying to hold back even though Draco\u2019s face is hidden against his chest. \u201cBut eventually you\u2019ll find a real mate.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDraco,\u201d Harry speaks slowly, needing Draco to understand. \u201c\n\nYou\n\n are my real mate, my proper mate, I don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t want anyone else... and I'm never going to- to put you aside for someone else. I only want you-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous!\u201d Draco interrupts, sounding angry. \u201cYou\u2019re Harry Potter. You\u2019re rich and fit and kind and you\u2026 you saved everyone... Harry. Everyone.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou should be with someone \n\nworthy\n\n of being your mate, not\u2026 not something like me.\u201d Draco finishes, his disgust and self hatred clearly evident in his voice.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDraco\u2026 you\u2019re not\u2026 you\u2019re not some disgusting thing\u2026 you\u2019re someone... you\u2019re someone who is smart and funny and so incredibly brave.\u201d Harry says, throat constricting with emotions. \u201cYou\u2019ve been through so much, you\u2019ve survived so much Draco.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c... and you are someone who I love and admire, and I chose \n\nyou\n\n, over everyone else.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI want you by my side forever, and\u2026\u201d Harry takes a shaking breath \u201cI want a family with you... whatever form that takes.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco is crying again, silently this time, and shaking his head as if to deny what Harry is saying but when Harry pulls him into a kiss, trying to make him feel the sincerity of his words, Draco relents and kisses back almost immediately.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nA long while later, when Draco\u2019s head is resting against Harry\u2019s chest and Harry is almost sure his mate has fallen asleep, Draco speaks up again.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo.. so you\u2019d really be okay with it? Being\u2026 being my mate? Raising a family with\u2026 with me?\u201d Draco\u2019s voice is quiet, disbelieving.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDraco, I\u2026 I want that very much.\u201d Harry says, wishing he knew some way to make Draco believe him. \u201cI\u2019ve never wanted anything more.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco is quiet, and Harry begins to wonder if he has fallen asleep but then the omega speaks up again, sounding vulnerable but\u2026 hopeful too.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019d really like that.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n.::Harry::.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen Draco shows up in the kitchen the next morning for breakfast, he\u2019s practically vibrating with nervous energy. Harry wants to go to him, and find some way to set those worries aside, but he doesn\u2019t know if that\u2019d be welcomed.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMorning\u201d Harry says, not turning around. He tries to force some cheerfulness in his voice, and he hopes if Draco notices the hollow note to it that he just puts it to Harry not having had his morning fix of caffeine yet.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe thing is, he\u2019d kind of thought, hoped really, that Draco would sleep with him in his room the night before. It\u2019d been a trying day for both of them, they\u2019d gotten such big news and he had thought that they had made such progress with their relationship, but when they\u2019d reached the hallway outside their rooms Draco had turned and disappeared into his own rooms, with hardly a good night thrown over his shoulder.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry had been left standing alone in the hallway, confused and disappointed, but he didn't press the issue.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nPatience, time, he reminds himself.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAs he\u2019d gotten ready for bed he had tried to tell himself that probably Draco just needed some space to think things over, but worry had gnawed at him late into the night.\n\n\u00a0\n\nRubbing at his tired eyes, he tries to focus on the omelets he\u2019s making for them, and not the burning feeling of Draco\u2019s eyes on his back.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s not very successful, but the food still turns out ok.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019d already given Kreacher his omelet and shooed him away, not yet ready to have the pregnancy conversation with the house elf\u2026 not sure he ever would be\u2026\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo all that is left is to plate up his and Draco\u2019s and take them to the table.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen he sets Draco\u2019s down in front of him, already sliding the salt and pepper shakers towards him before he has a chance to ask, Draco shoots him a shy glancing smile and Harry\u2019s heart thuds in his chest.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThanks\u201d Draco says quietly, accepting the salt and pepper happily and adding his fill to the top of his omelet.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry isn\u2019t sure where they stand, where Draco is at, emotionally speaking, but this is surely a good sign, he thinks.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe hopes.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey eat quietly, aside from the occasional happy hum from Draco when he takes a bite he particularly enjoys, each quiet sound sending arousal spiking through Harry.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe wonders if he\u2019ll ever get used to this, if the attraction he feels towards his mate will ever stop being so\u2026 consuming.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry wonders again how Draco ever thought he wasn\u2019t serious about being his mate, he\u2019s pretty sure he wanders around the house all day every day looking at Draco like he\u2019d hung the stars. It\u2019s certainly how he feels.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd again Harry berates himself for not making his affection, and intentions, clearer sooner.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nEventually, finished eating, Draco puts down his utensils and dabs at his, still immaculately clean, face gently with his napkin.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHarry.\u201d Draco says, \u201cI- I want to talk to you about something.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco almost never speaks up first like this, and Harry feels worry clenching around his heart and throat. He\u2019s not yet finished his omelet, but his appetite is gone, his throat gone dry with nerves.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry sets down his own utensils, and nods at his mate.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco takes a deep breath, like he\u2019s steeling himself for something, and Harry feels his worry reach new heights.\n\n\u00a0\n\nUnder the table, Draco lifts one of his feet and places it in Harry\u2019s lap.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cLook at the ankle.\u201d Draco says cryptically.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry, confused, rolls down Draco\u2019s sock so he can examine his ankle.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d He asks, Draco\u2019s ankle doesn\u2019t seem injured, but his anxiety rises anyway. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe looks up to Draco\u2019s face, hoping for answers, and sees that Draco is biting his lip and looking at him, searching Harry\u2019s own face for some sort of reaction.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s not sure how he\u2019s supposed to be reacting. Draco doesn\u2019t seem injured, and as Harry runs his hand over the ankle in his lap to check again, Draco\u2019s eyes slip closed and a contented sigh escapes him.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat day\u2026\u201d Draco says suddenly, voice quiet, nervous, sure. \u201cI\u2019ve\u2026 I\u2019ve been thinking about what the healer said\u2026\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry\u2019s heart stutters. Had he changed his mind about the pregnancy?\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat day\u2026 when you saved me from the fiendfyre\u2026\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s not what Harry expects, and he can\u2019t follow the jump in subjects. Harry\u2019s hand clenches slightly, unconsciously, around Draco\u2019s ankle. He still has nightmares about the fiendfyre sometimes\u2026 though not nearly as often now that Draco lives with him.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhile you were flying us out of there, I got burned a little\u2026 just on my ankle...\u201d Draco says, eyes still closed. \u201cI presented shortly after we parted ways.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt takes Harry a moment to catch up to what Draco is implying, why he\u2019s bringing all of this up, and when he does he feels like he can't breathe.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2026 Are you saying\u2026 the other bond, was with... me?\u201d He asks, not sure what answer he wants to hear.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco nods, then says, voice dripping with trepidation.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the only possibility that makes any sense.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nFuck.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis whole time. Draco had been in so much pain because of a bond to him. He hadn\u2019t known. But his mate had been in pain and had been so mistreated and\u2026\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd he\u2019d done nothing.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDraco, I had no idea.\u201d he says voice breaking under the weight of his emotions. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco shakes his head and brushes away the apology like it doesn\u2019t matter, like he doesn\u2019t need it.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe healer told me, after she sent you off to go do paperwork\u2026\u201d Draco says, eyes still closed. \u201cI don't think she wanted to upset you... but she told me\u2026 that as much as it hurt to have two bonds...\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry\u2019s heart aches, it was his fault. His fault his mate had been in pain.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat the bond that stuck around probably\u2026 probably saved me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry\u2019s breath catches in his throat.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI wanted so badly, early in\u2026 that time\u2026 for you to save me.\u201d Draco says, and then he opens his eyes and meets Harry\u2019s causing Harry\u2019s stomach to do somersaults with the intensity of his gaze.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAnd you \n\ndid\n\n.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n.::Draco::.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry looks thunderstruck. Draco can\u2019t really blame him.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s been a crazy week, and this at least is something Draco has had some time to come to terms with himself. The rest\u2026\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco bites his lip.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe rest still feels like too much. His brain shies away from the intensity with which he wants to believe that Harry genuinely considers him his mate, that he will never be put aside and that they\u2026 that they can raise this child, their child, together.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt still feels like it can\u2019t be real.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe doesn\u2019t doubt Harry\u2019s sincerity, but\u2026 surely things can\u2019t just work out.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHis life just isn\u2019t like that.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThese thoughts are pointless and stressful, so for now he puts them aside.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco stands and crosses around the end of the table until he\u2019s standing before Harry.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt feels weird to be looking down on an alpha like this, and he almost feels like he should apologize, but instead he goes forward with his plan.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe leans down and pulls Harry into a kiss.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe alpha sighs into the kiss, immediately returning it. Draco\u2019s eyes flutter closed, and he can feel the warmth of Harry\u2019s hands on his hips through the layers of clothes.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe wants to get lost in this moment.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut eventually he pulls away, resting his forehead against Harry\u2019s.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco\u2019s hands shake with how nervous he is, and Harry, no doubt feeling the tremors where Draco\u2019s hands rest against his cheek and chest, turns confused eyes on him.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAre\u2026 are we okay?\u201d Draco manages to force himself to ask. It\u2019s not enough, it doesn\u2019t properly encompass all the things he wants to ask, all the things he needs Harry to confirm.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d Harry says, so sure of his answer.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco tries to swallow down the tears threatening to overwhelm him, and wonders if its too early to blame his wildly out of control emotions on the pregnancy.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDraco,\u201d Harry says, brushing the tip of his nose affectionately against Draco\u2019s \u201cI love you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco\u2019s heart flutters.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSomehow it\u2019s all the answer he needed, to all of the questions he couldn\u2019t ask.\u00a0\n\n\n.::Draco::.\n\n\n\u201cDraco\u2026 can I take this off?\u201d Harry asks hesitantly, fingertips skimming underneath the hem of Draco\u2019s shirt.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco bites his lip, he doesn\u2019t want to. He\u2019d volunteered taking off his trousers and pants, that was just practical and he\u2019d found that he much preferred the range of positions they could manage if he didn\u2019t have those on, but his shirt\u2026\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere just isn\u2019t any practical reason why they need that off, and he\u2026 he still doesn\u2019t want Harry to see any more of him than he has to.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2026 I guess\u2026 if you want to.\u201d Draco stutters.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe can feel Harry\u2019s eyes searching his face, and fights the impulse to turn away from that gaze.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDraco\u2026\u201d Harry says, nuzzling his face against Draco\u2019s neck in a way that makes Draco\u2019s heart flutter. \u201cIt\u2019s your choice. It\u2019s okay if the answer is no.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco\u2019s throat constricts.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe hasn\u2019t been punished once since coming to live with Harry, he reminds himself. Harry said that he thinks of Draco as his mate, his proper mate. Harry told him that he loves him.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe takes a few deep breaths, and lets the alpha\u2019s scent comfort him.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI- I don\u2019t want you to see.\u201d He manages to say, hands shaky where they rest against Potter\u2019s own bare chest.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBecause of the scars?\u201d Harry asks, giving their bond mark one more quick kiss before lifting his head to better look at Draco\u2019s face.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco\u2019s throat feels tight with anxiety again and he nods.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry sighs and presses a kiss to Draco\u2019s forehead.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThank you for telling me Draco.\u201d Harry says, and Draco briefly lets himself bask in the warmth of the alpha\u2019s words,\n\n his\n\n alpha he reminds himself. \u201cAnd if you want to keep the shirt on that\u2019s okay, but\u2026\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry presses kisses to Draco\u2019s nose and cheeks.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about the scars, they don\u2019t bother me.\u201d Harry says, his fingertips tracing along some of the faded bond marks on Draco\u2019s leg.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco shivers.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI- they\u2019re... ugly\u2026 and shameful\u2026\u201d Draco says, barely managing to remember to switch the \u2018I\u2019 for \u2018they\u2019, knowing the later will upset the alpha less.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDraco\u2026\u201d Harry says sitting back on his heels. Draco immediately misses his warmth.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry just looks down at him for a moment, thinking. Draco tries not to fidget anxiously.\n\n\u00a0\n\nEventually, maybe noticing Draco\u2019s discomfort, Harry sighs and leans back over Draco to nuzzle against their bond mark reassuringly.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDo you want me to put my shirt back on?\u201d Harry asks quietly.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco immediately shakes his head \u2018no\u2019. Why would he want that?\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI have scars too.\u201d Harry says, as if hearing Draco\u2019s unasked question.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco swallows. Harry does have scars, loads of them. Weird ones, magic ones, barely-even-there-any-more ones, but\u2026 Harry\u2019s scars are different then Draco\u2019s. He traces the starburst scar on the center of Harry\u2019s chest with his fingertip, biting his lip.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry\u2019s scars are from saving the world, accidents at school, quidditch\u2026 they tell the story of a life that has had value\u2026 merit...\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco\u2019s scars tell a very different story. One Draco is sick of hearing.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s different.\u201d Draco says. It\u2019s all he can manage.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNot to me it isn\u2019t.\u201d Harry says, voice gone rough with emotions.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDraco,\u201d Harry continues, lips so close to their bond mark that Draco can feel them brush as he speaks, \u201cI love \n\nevery\n\n inch of you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco\u2019s heart stutters in his chest.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry pulls back and he manages to catch Draco\u2019s eye before he has a chance to look away. Draco just lays there, feeling frozen in place by the intensity he can see in Harry\u2019s eyes.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry searches Draco\u2019s eyes for a moment, before pressing his lips to Draco\u2019s. Draco\u2019s eyes flutter closed a moment after Harry\u2019s, and he gives himself over to the feeling of the kiss.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry, true to his words, doesn\u2019t press the shirt issue. He doesn\u2019t ask again, and he doesn\u2019t try to remove the shirt. He just goes back to kissing Draco the way he had been before.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco\u2019s glad for it, at first. He lets himself relax back into the bed beneath him, Harry a warm solid presence above him as the alpha slowly drives Draco mad with kisses.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco is making a mess of the bed, he\u2019s sure of it. He can feel the slick leaking out of him and onto the bed sheets. But if Harry notices, he doesn\u2019t seem to care, he just keeps kissing Draco, a hand occasionally ghosting along Draco\u2019s side or leg, but his hips frustratingly always out of reach of Draco\u2019s.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cH-Harry\u2026 please\u2026\u201d Draco whines.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry groans, his hips twitch, the tip of his erection just barely skimming against Draco\u2019s thigh even as he tries to reign in his reaction.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cPlease what?\u201d Harry asks, lips brushing against Draco\u2019s ear as he speaks. \u201cWhatever you want.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco shivers, heat flooding his face with a blush.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2026 I want you\u2026 I want your knot.\u201d Draco says, desire making it easier to push past the embarrassment.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry tenses, and pulls away from Draco, searching his face.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWould\u2026 would that be okay?\u201d Harry asks, sounding worried.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco\u2019s confusion must show on his face because Harry clarifies a moment later.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat with\u2026 with the pregnancy and all\u2026\u201d Harry is blushing now, and Draco catches him dart a glance down towards Draco\u2019s belly before looking back at his face.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d Draco says. If he\u2019s honest, he'd been kind of caught up in all of this and the memory of Harry\u2019s \u2018I love you\u2019 earlier and he had kind of somewhat forgotten about that particular bit of big news.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh yeah, that should be fine.\u201d Draco says, and when Harry still seems unsure he adds. \u201cI promise.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Harry says, like Draco promising is enough for him, and Draco realizes, as Harry leans back down and resumes kissing him, that maybe it is.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen Harry\u2019s questing fingers find Draco\u2019s entrance to check if he is ready to go Harry rumbles happily.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo good\u2026 how\u2019d I ever get so lucky?\u201d Harry mumbles against Draco\u2019s shoulder as he lines himself up.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco lets himself bask in the warmth of the alpha\u2019s praise, as Harry pushes in.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe slow slide of Harry\u2019s cock feels amazing, and Draco arches his back pressing up against Harry\u2019s bare chest and pushing back against Harry\u2019s cock pulling it in deeper faster.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry gasps against Draco\u2019s neck.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow that he knows, well... he strongly suspects, that he\u2019s allowed to, Draco can\u2019t get enough of touching Harry. And as his hands glide over the shifting muscles of Harry\u2019s back as he thrusts into Draco again and again, Draco wonders for the first time if maybe there is a practical reason to be shirtless.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019d certainly be able to have far more skin to skin contact with Harry if it wasn\u2019t for the shirt he is wearing.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cH-Harry\u201d Draco manages to gasp out, trying to get the alpha\u2019s attention.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry rumbles happily in response, grinding extra deep and nipping at their bond mark. Realizing the miscommunication, Draco tries again.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHarry no I-\u201d Harry freezes, and when he turns worried green eyes on Draco, Draco realizes he has messed up again.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo, I- I\u2019m fine I just\u2026 I want this off.\u201d Draco says, pulling at the hem of his shirt.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry looks relieved for the clarification, and he sighs and takes a moment to just breathe before he asks.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAre you sure? You don\u2019t have to.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco thinks about it again, then nods.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry, still inside him, sits back on his heels.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDo you want-\u201d Harry starts to ask but Draco has his shirt off and tossed somewhere on the floor before he can even finish.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco can\u2019t look at Harry\u2019s reaction. He avoids looking in mirrors as much as possible, but he\u2019s still pretty sure he has a good idea of what he looks like. And\u2026 it\u2019s not great.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen he\u2019d decided about the shirt he\u2019d just been thinking about touching, about more skin on skin contact. He hadn\u2019t really accounted for the amount of time Harry would look at him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s just started to regret his decision when Harry surprises him by pressing a kiss to the center of Draco\u2019s chest.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMerlin, I love you Draco.\u201d Harry mumbles against Draco\u2019s skin.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco\u2019s heart thunders so loudly in his chest he\u2019s sure Harry must be able to feel it.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry starts moving his hips again, but his mouth doesn\u2019t return to Draco\u2019s neck. Instead his lips dance across what newly exposed parts of Draco he can reach. His tongue licks broad stripes across Draco\u2019s nipple, causing Draco to gasp in surprise from the feeling of it. Then he pulls it into his mouth and sucks, causing Draco to shudder and whine.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry rumbles happily, and gives Draco\u2019s other nipple the same treatment.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe kisses and licks at every inch of Draco\u2019s chest his mouth can reach, his tongue tracing the overlapping scars from past bond marks.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nDraco shudders helplessly below him, and he\u2019s honestly not sure how much longer he can last against this new onslaught.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nLuckily for him, it seems he\u2019s not the only one who is enjoying the result of his impulsive decision, and it\u2019s not long before he feels Harry\u2019s knott beginning to swell.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo good, so beautiful.\u201d Harry is mumbling in between pressing kisses all across Draco\u2019s skin.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco can\u2019t hold back his whimper at the praise, but the sound only seems to please his mate.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry\u2019s having trouble keeping up the onslaught on Draco\u2019s chest, as he keeps having to pause to gasp desperately against Draco\u2019s overheated skin.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry shifts, his mouth meets Draco\u2019s. Draco kisses back as best he can manage and Harry groans in response.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry\u2019s lips make their way to Draco\u2019s ear, and when he speaks his voice is ragged from exertion as he continues to thrust and grind into Draco.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI love you.\u201d He says.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco shivers. He\u2019s so close.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry\u2019s mouth moves down Draco\u2019s neck, and when his teeth sink into their bond mark Draco\u2019s orgasm crashes over him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry\u2019s follows swiftly after.\n\n\u00a0\n\nLater, when they\u2019re more settled and starting to calm down, still tied together, Draco hesitantly asks.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAre\u2026 are you sure this is what you want?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry chuckles, and Draco is not sure how he\u2019s supposed to take that.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDraco\u2026\u201d Harry says, voice soft, an arm wrapped around Draco\u2019s middle as they cuddle on the bed. \u201cIn this moment I have everything I have ever wanted here in my arms. Yes I\u2019m sure.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat\u2026 what do you mean?\u201d Draco asks. It doesn\u2019t make sense. None of this makes sense. He knows it's pointless to try to make sense of Potter but still\u2026\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019ve always wanted this.\u201d Harry answers. \u201cA mate, a family.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI- I\u2019ve had a lot of offers.\u201d Harry admits, and Draco\u2019s heart sinks.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBut none of them ever seemed\u2026 right? I don\u2019t know\u2026 but it was different with you. It just, it felt right.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAlphas aren\u2019t compelled by their bonds to stay faithful to their mates, but still, Draco\u2019s sure that what Harry\u2019s describing has something to do with their lingering bond. Even so, there\u2019s comfort in his words and in the weight of his arm around Draco, and, for once, Draco is the first to fall asleep.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.::Draco::.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDraco stop fretting. You look fine.\u201d Harry says, and Draco glares at him through the mirror.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry just smiles back at him, the git.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco goes back to adjusting his shirt to try to hide his baby bump. It\u2019s still pretty small, but it seems like its getting bigger and more noticeable by the day and Draco can't help but feel very self conscious about it.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDraco,\u201d Harry says with a sigh. \u201cI know this is important but you already look beautiful and we really do need to go.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco, cheeks pinking at the compliment, sighs and decides that it really will do no good to be late.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry helps Draco into his coat, and tucks him under his arm when they step outside. Once outside the wards, he pulls Draco even closer and apparates them to an alley around the corner from the cafe they are headed to.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco holds onto Harry tightly while he waits for the world to stop spinning around him. Apparation is becoming increasingly unpleasant as the pregnancy goes on.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOnce the world has stilled he looks up, glancing around the deserted side street Harry had apparated them to. Being outdoors still makes him uncomfortable, but it\u2019s getting easier with practice. There are people walking by on the busier cross street down at the corner, but on their end of the street they are alone. He shifts the collar of his jacket higher, hoping to ward off strangers staring at his scars.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAlright?\u201d Harry asks.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco considers it a moment before he nods.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey walk to the busier road, Draco once again tucked under Harry's arm. It only takes a few minutes to walk to the cafe, and none of the muggles passing them seem to notice Dracos scars.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen they arrive at the cafe, the people they are there to meet have already arrived and are seated stiffly at a small table well away from the other patrons.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco\u2019s breath catches in his throat as he sees his parents for the first time in years. Harry squeezes his shoulder gently and guides him over to the table.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey look the same as he remembers them, just... older, more so then they really ought to\u2026 as if the stress of looking for him has added years to them.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHis father, when he spots them, eyes them suspiciously but manages to otherwise keep his face politely blank. His mother\u2019s eyes shine with unshed tears when she spots her son.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDraco.\u201d She says, making a move to get up and go to him but she\u2019s stopped by her husband's hand on her shoulder.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMother.\u201d Draco greets with a nod, his voice rough with emotions.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry pulls out a seat for Draco before dropping inelegantly into the seat next to him. Harry drapes his arm across Dracos shoulders and lets his hand brush lightly against their bond mark. It's a comforting gesture, and Draco, whose nerves already feel very frayed, appreciates it.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMr Malfoy, Mrs Malfoy. It's good to see you both.\u201d Harry says politely.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco\u2019s mother, still misty eyed, stares at him. She is studying every visible inch like she's trying to memorize him. His father stares seriously at Potter and almost seems to be refusing to look at him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHis stomach turns nervously.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe server appears at that moment, and Harry orders for the both of them. A coffee for himself and a pastry for Draco.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHis efforts to make Draco fat seem to have redoubled now that he knows Draco is pregnant, and he never misses an opportunity to make sure Draco eats. Not that Draco minds entirely, if he's honest.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe table is silent while they wait for the server to come back, but when she has left their food and drinks his father jumps right into things.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo, Mr. Potter have you reconsidered my offers? As I have written to you several times, my wife and I will do anything you require to-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes I recall.\u201d Harry says interrupting. Draco can see his father's nostrils flare, the only visible indication of his anger. \u201cI also recall telling you several times in our written exchanges that Draco is my mate and as such I will not be sending him away. Not even to his parents.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco had never worked up the courage to send his parents a letter. Harry though, had continued to correspond with them.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt would seem that tensions between the two alphas had been steadily growing though, which is why Harry had asked Draco if it was okay if he set up today.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry hoped that if Draco\u2019s parents actually got a chance to see that Draco was fine and that Harry was taking care of him, that that might finally convince Lucius that he is genuine in claiming Draco as his mate.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cFather.\u201d Draco says hesitantly, not sure what he will see when his father looks at him properly for the first time.\n\n\u00a0\n\nLucius\u2019 expression remains the polite mask it has been this whole time, but Draco can see great depths of emotions in his eyes briefly before they become too closed off and glacial.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe intensity of the guilt he sees there shocks him, and he understands then that his father blames himself for all the things Draco has been through, and all the things he imagines Draco is still going through.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe cant speak past the emotions choking him for a moment, and he has to take a sip of his water before continuing.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cFather\u2026 this isn't exactly what I imagined for my future, and getting here was... not pleasant I'll admit, but I'm actually quite happy with Harry. He.. He takes good care of me and\u2026 and he makes me feel valued.\u201d Draco can feel a blush burning across his cheeks and flat out refuses to acknowledge the sappy look Harry is no doubt giving him.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIm happy. Very happy. Harry is a good mate. We\u2019ve\u2026 we\u2019ve decided to start a family.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nNarcissa makes a surprised noise, obviously spotting the hand Draco has subconsciously placed over his belly.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh Draco, are you pregnant?\u201d She asks.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco nods, blush worsening.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe glances at his father who is looking away and seems to be trying to compose himself.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAre.. Are you excited?\u201d Narcissa asks, hesitantly.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d Draco says, turning his attention back to her. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m very nervous too\u2026 but yes. I\u2019m excited.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh Draco\u2026 I'm so happy for you.\u201d Narcissa says, tears in her eyes.\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe launches into so much pregnancy and baby talk it makes Draco\u2019s head spin, he tries to pay attention but he's sure he misses at least half of it.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt honestly just feels so nice to hear her voice again, and he lets the sound of it wash over him soothingly.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe glances at Harry while he and his mother talk, and is greeted by such a look of love and adoration it makes his heart stutter and he wonders how he ever thought Harry wasn't serious in his affection.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n.::Draco::.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHarry it\u2019s traditional.\u201d Draco says with fond exasperation.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI know, I know\u2026\u201d Harry says, nuzzling Draco\u2019s neck as they lay sprawled out on their bed. \u201cIt\u2019s just... it\u2019s important\u2026 and you\u2019re so much better at this sort of thing then me\u2026 I don\u2019t want to mess it up.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey\u2019ve had this conversation before.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI know, but\u2026 it\u2019s traditional for the alpha parent to chose the name. It\u2019s important to me.\u201d Draco says, squeezing Harry\u2019s hand where it\u2019s resting on his swollen belly.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Harry says, surprising Draco. He\u2019d expected more whining. \u201cBut, is it okay if you help me?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cJust..\u201d Harry continues, not giving Draco a chance to protest. \u201cIf I tell you what kinds of names I\u2019m thinking of, could you help me come up with some options, and then I\u2019ll choose from there?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco thinks about this a moment, Harry would be ultimately deciding\u2026 he doesn\u2019t suppose there is any problem with helping him with ideas.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay\u201d Draco concedes.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry beams at him, causing Draco to blush and look away.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI was thinking if it was a girl we could go with a flower name since both of our mums sort of have flower names\u2026\u201d Harry says, sounding nervous. \u201cAnd for a boy I was thinking maybe some sort of star or constellation name\u2026 if you\u2019d think that\u2019d be okay?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe looks so nervous as he waits for Draco\u2019s response and Draco\u2019s affection for this man, his mate, threatens to overwhelm him.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019d be wonderful Harry.\u201d Draco says, pleased with the realization that for all his reluctance and whining Harry has actually been putting thought into this.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay, so you\u2019ll help me come up with some ideas?\u201d Harry asks.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah, we can make a list of options for each.\u201d Draco says.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry pulls him into a kiss, and Draco is pretty sure he couldn\u2019t be happier, warm and safe with the man he loves, planning for their growing little family.\n\n\n.::Harry::.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHarry\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s a breathy needy whisper, barely audible even in the quiet of their dark room, but it\u2019s enough to startle Harry awake.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he asks, confused and still half asleep \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco whines and presses back against him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMerlin he\u2019s so wet, and his skin is so warm\u2026 feverish almost.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt hits him finally what is going on, Draco is in heat.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco presses back against him again.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWant you so badly.\u201d The omega whines.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry\u2019s hips jerk of their own accord, pressing his aching cock harder against his mate\u2019s ass.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nMerlin this is different, he thinks.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis is only Draco\u2019s second heat since coming to live with Harry, since his heats had stopped while he was pregnant and for a few months after, and it is already vastly different than his first one.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe swallows down a moan at the slick slide of Draco wiggling against him, and he forces himself to get up.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco makes a terrified noise and tries to pull him back.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe catches Draco\u2019s hands in his and kisses them both.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry love.\u201d He says \u201cI will be back as soon as I can be, I promise. I just need to get Delilah to your parents so your mom can watch her while you\u2019re in heat. I will be right back, I promise.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco\u2019s eyes clear a bit and he nods, biting his lip to keep down another whimper.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s been the plan for a while, for Delilah to spend Draco\u2019s next heat with her grandparents. Neither Draco nor Harry would be well equipped to take care of her while Draco is in heat, and they had built a pretty good relationship with Draco\u2019s parents during the pregnancy. Draco\u2019s parents adore Delilah, and while things are still sometimes tense between Harry and Lucius, he suspects that that will always be true and is just a fact that one has to live with when mated to Lucius\u2019 child.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry hastily grabs some clothes off the floor, throwing them on haphazardly as he makes his way to the door. He pauses a moment in the adjoining nursery to collect himself as best he can. He grabs the bag they had prepared of Delilah\u2019s belongings and then crosses to the crib. She is sleeping peacefully, but when Harry picks her up she blinks awake and burbles at him happily. She\u2019s the least fussy baby Harry\u2019s ever met, and everyone who meets her seems to adore her.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOverwhelmed by love and affection he gently brushes her soft baby hair back from her face and kisses her forehead.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe had thought he couldn\u2019t love anyone as much as he loves his mate, until the day that Delilah came into their lives.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe wraps her up snuggly in a blanket, carries her outside of the wards, and apparates them to the manor. Once there, he reluctantly passes Delilah over to a delighted Narcissa.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nLucius looks a little green, but he doesn\u2019t comment.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry can\u2019t imagine what it must be like, knowing what Harry and his son are likely to be getting up to as soon as Harry returns.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nMerlin he does not look forward to having to potentially deal with that sort of thing when Delilah is older.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe apparates back to Grimmauld, and the smell that hits him as soon as he steps inside is by itself enough to bring his erection back to full hardness.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHe heads directly to their bedroom.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen he opens the door his eyes are immediately drawn to his mate. Draco has pushed aside the blanket and has one hand wrapped around his cock and the other pushing into himself.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHarry sways in the doorway, a fresh wave of arousal overwhelming him.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cH-Harry\u201d Draco whines when he sees him, his hips jerking back against the hand inside him. \u201cNnngh\u2026 it\u2019s- it\u2019s not enough\u2026 please.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry moves towards the bed, shedding his clothes as he goes. When he reaches the bed he nudges Draco to encourage him to roll onto his stomach and then crawls onto the bed behind him, between his spread legs.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco whines and shifts beneath him, seemingly caught between rubbing himself against the bed below him or pushing his ass up towards Harry.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cPlease, please Harry please-\u201d Draco is murmuring on repeat, his hands twisting into the sheets beneath him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s the single most arousing thing Harry has ever seen. Draco, his mate, so disheveled and desperate, excess slick leaking from him and creating a shining trail downwards, his voice shaking as he begs for Harry.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry wants to make Draco feel as good as Draco makes him feel. Harry wants to make it so Draco enjoys this heat. The need to please his mate, his love, is just as consuming as ever.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry grips Draco\u2019s cheeks, and spreads them apart exposing his leaking hole. Harry rumbles happily at the sight. This is his, Draco is his, and he is going to make Draco feel so good.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe licks a broad stripe along the crease. Darco gasps in shock, his hands clenching tighter into the sheets and his hips pushing back against the pressure of Harry\u2019s tongue as it passes over his asshole.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco\u2019s slick tastes delicious.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry laps at it, at Draco\u2019s hole, and Draco sobs and whines below him, desperate for something to be inside him. Harry licks and nips at the outside a few more times before giving in to Draco\u2019s want and pressing his tongue inside of him.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco keens and presses back against Harry\u2019s face, trying to draw him in deeper.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco doesn\u2019t really need to be prepped or stretched or anything, his body is already more than ready, but Harry wants to make this good, wants this heat to be fantastic. He lets himself enjoy the taste of his mate, the feel of him around his tounge, and the desperate whines that he makes.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cPlease, please Harry.\u201d Draco starts up the begging again, in between his whimpers and groans.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry pulls his mouth away, and Draco sobs at the loss of the tongue inside him.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cPlease what?\u201d Harry asks, moving so he\u2019s leaning above Draco and can whisper his questions in his ear. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry knows the answer already, but he never tires of hearing Draco ask.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cPlease- I want your knot please.\u201d Draco gasps out, his hips shifting as he tries to press up against Harry.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Harry says with a smile, nuzzling against their bond mark. \u201cAnything for my good boy.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco shudders at being called a good boy, and Harry shifts his weight to one hand so he can use the other to line himself up with Draco\u2019s hole.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe pushes in slowly, enjoying the feeling of sinking into his mate. Draco immediately tries to push back against him, to draw him in deeper faster, but Harry, anticipating this, grips his hip and holds him in place so he can go as slowly as he wants to.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nOnce buried to the hilt in Draco, he stills. Draco whines and shifts beneath him, and Harry nuzzles against Draco\u2019s neck trying to soothe him.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Harry says quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I promise I\u2019m going to take care of you. You just gotta give me a moment.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco whines but stills.\n\n\u00a0\n\nA pleased rumble goes through Harry at his mate\u2019s compliance and, when he feels like he can move without all of this ending prematurely Harry sits back up and starts to pull out watching as Draco\u2019s hole clings to him as he slowly pulls out all but the very tip.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe thrusts back in shallowly before pulling out again, his eyes glued to where their bodies connect.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMerlin, I love the way you take my cock Draco.\u201d Harry says, glancing at Draco\u2019s face in time to see the pleased flush of his cheeks before he buries his face against the pillow.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry smiles moving forward again so his chest is over Draco\u2019s back and he can nuzzle against Draco\u2019s face where he\u2019s trying to hide.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI love you Draco.\u201d Harry says. \u201cI\u2019m going to make you feel so good. I promise.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe thrusts forward again, burying himself all the way. He repeats the action, again and again, hitting Draco\u2019s prostate as often as he can. It\u2019s not long before Draco is little more than a writhing whining mess below him, and Harry rumbles happily over pleasuring his mate.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo good Draco, you\u2019re so good to me.\u201d Harry murmurs against Draco\u2019s neck. \u201cI\u2019m going to cum inside you, knot you, over and over again. By the end of your heat you\u2019re going to be so full of my seed there\u2019s no way you wont be pregnant again.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco whines and pushes back against Harry harder, drawing him in deeper.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry rumbles happily.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah, you want that baby? You want to be fat with my cub again? You want to give little Delilah a younger sibling?\u201d He asks, voice shaking with desire as this plays into both of their heat encouraged instincts.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey\u2019d talked about it before, after Delilah was born. About whether or not they wanted more and if so, when. Harry had been surprised by Draco\u2019s willingness to have another as soon as possible, and Harry had certainly had no objections.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019d always loved the idea of a big family, he just hadn\u2019t expected that Draco would want that too.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes! Yes Harry please. Please.\u201d Draco practically sobs beneath him. \u201cI want your cum, I want your babies.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry groans against Draco\u2019s shoulder. He can feel his knot beginning to swell. He starts grinding his hips against Draco\u2019s, pressing against his prostate as much as possible.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cGood boy\u201d Harry says, voice ragged with arousal and exertion, before he sinks his teeth into their bond mark.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco comes with a shudder and a whine, and Harry follows swiftly after.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAs they lay spooning, trying to recover their breath, Harry takes stock of how Draco is doing. His sweat soaked skin is still feverish, though it is cooler than before, and his eyes seem clearer.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHow are you feeling? Any pain?\u201d Harry asks.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco smiles at him tiredly.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo pain. Just\u2026 tired. And\u2026 I guess it's still weird to think this is how a heat is supposed to feel.\u201d Draco says. \u201cI\u2019m not used to it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWell you better get used to it\u201d Harry says. \u201cBecause I\u2019m never letting you have a bad heat again.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco chuckles softly, and his smile makes Harry\u2019s breath catch.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI love you Harry.\u201d Draco says fondly.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI love you too.\u201d Harry says back, just as fondly.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n.::Draco::.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s seven pm on Christmas Eve, and Draco knows Harry is hoping they can get Delilah to bed soon. They have a big day tomorrow, between visiting the Burrow and Draco\u2019s parents, and a well rested toddler is a better behaved toddler.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry\u2019s only just gotten a wiggly Delilah changed into her new pajamas that they had just opened. Draco hangs back in the doorway, watching his mate and their child as they play together on the rug before the fire. The carefully wrapped present clutched behind his back temporarily forgotten as he watches the happy scene before him.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nBetween the war, and his time when he\u2019d been captured, Draco spent so long, so much of his life, thinking that a life like this, happiness like this, could never be his. That it wasn\u2019t real, or at least it was something reserved for things far more deserving than something like him.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDraco?\u201d Harry asks, he\u2019s still playing with Delilah but now he\u2019s looking at Draco with concern.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco still has bad moments.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nTimes when the fear and the pain of his past overwhelms him. Times when it feels like he\u2019s still broken, like he\u2019ll never be fixed. Times when he\u2019s still scared and distrustful of any alpha, even the ones he knows wont hurt him.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut those times pass.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry helps bring him back, or Delilah.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco wipes his face with the hand not hiding the present behind his back, and is only mildly surprised to find there are tears on his cheeks.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d Draco says, reassuring his mate. \u201cJust happy.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco can tell Harry is still at least a little worried, sees him glance at where Draco is clearly hiding something behind his back, but the alpha doesn\u2019t press for more information. He trusts Draco to tell him if there\u2019s anything he needs to know, and this thought warms Draco almost as much as the sound of their daughter\u2019s giggle a moment later.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco makes his way into the room, keeping the present hidden as he carefully sits on the edge of the couch. He bites his lip nervously.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI- I have one more present I thought we should open tonight.\u201d Draco says, pulling the neatly wrapped present from behind his back.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDelilah\u2019s eyes light up. She\u2019s young enough to still be more interested in the wrapping paper than the presents mostly, but she \n\nloves\n\n wrapping paper.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI thought we were just doing the pajamas tonight and saving the rest for tomorrow?\u201d Harry asks with a raised brow, but he\u2019s already encouraging Delilah to toddle across the rug towards Draco.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah, but I thought this one would be a good one for tonight too.\u201d Draco says. \u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry moves closer once he\u2019s sure Delilah has managed to get a hold on the couch next to Draco. He rests his head on Draco\u2019s knee, and Draco lets his fingers comb through his mate\u2019s perpetually unruly hair while they watch Delilah tear into the present.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe gets it open pretty quickly, and, like Draco expected, completely ignores the picture book that falls out in favor of further tearing the wrapping paper.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry pics the book up though, and looks it over.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI- I thought you could read it to her tonight before bed.\u201d Draco says, trying his best to keep the nervousness out of his voice. \u201cShe loves when you read her a bedtime story.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen Harry grins up at him, it makes Draco\u2019s heart skip a beat. Harry reaches up to pull Draco down into a sweet kiss.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThank you, it was a wonderful idea.\u201d Harry says, pulling away only just enough to speak. Draco can feel the blush burning across his cheeks.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe sound of Delilah blowing a raspberry pulls their attention back to her.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cGwoss\u201d she says, frowning dramatically at them, before giggling a moment later and crawling into Harry\u2019s lap.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe\u2019s been spending too much time around Ginny, Draco thinks.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAround twenty minutes later Delilah\u2019s laying in her bed, with Harry seated beside her and reading the book Draco gave her. Draco\u2019s standing nearby, still trying not to let his nervousness show. He can tell he\u2019s not succeeding one hundred percent, because of the questioning glances Harry keeps sending him.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco hopes he isn\u2019t too distracted to get the point of Draco\u2019s present.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDelilah is already nodding off, always so quick to fall asleep when Harry reads to her.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c... and that is how I became a big sister.\u201d Harry reads from the book, turning to the next page, fully ready to just keep reading but instead he just freezes and stares at the page before him blankly.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco chews on his bottom lip nervously as he watches his mate. Draco knows what\u2019s on that page. He\u2019s looked at it himself plenty since he\u2019d bought the customized book.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry looks up at him, finally, after what feels to Draco like ages of simply staring down at the book. He has tears in his eyes and a hopeful expression on his face.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d He asks.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco can only manage to nod.\n\n\u00a0\n\nA moment later Harry has lifted Draco off the ground in a hug, his happy laughter filling the room as he spins Draco around in his arms.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re happy?\u201d Draco asks, when they slow to a stop and Harry sets him down again.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d Harry says, cupping Draco\u2019s face with his hand and pulling him into a kiss. \u201cAre you?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d Draco says, honestly. \u201cI\u2019m so happy.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe book, left forgotten on the floor is still open to the page Harry had been staring at, the positive results of Draco\u2019s pregnancy test printed across it.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDraco, it's not that big of a deal.\u201d Harry says as they come through the doors to Grimmauld Place. He\u2019s holding a pouting Delilah\u2019s hand and Draco is carrying little Cyrus. \u201cThey\u2019re kids. Biting is pretty normal, and you know they\u2019re far too young for any sort of bond or anything to form.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry bends down in the entryway to help Delilah with her coat but she\u2019s pouting and wont let him.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDelilah, honey, we need to take your coat off.\u201d Harry says to her gently.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s always gentle, with all of them.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s one of the things Draco loves about his mate, but also something he\u2019s jealous of.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nGentleness doesn\u2019t come easily to him. He loves his mate, he loves their kids. He would die for any of them, gladly.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut he\u2019s still more prickly than your average cactus.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBiting is unbecoming of a young lady.\u201d Draco says, primly. \u201cDelilah I know you know how to behave better than that.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cJeremy deserved it!\u201d His daughter yells as she stomps her foot.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry finally manages to get her coat off.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he did that kid is a little-\u201d Draco starts, but falters when Harry shoots him a look.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey\u2019ve been trying to watch their language in front of the kids. Delilah already picks up enough bad words from her plethora of \u201caunts\u201d and \u201cuncles\u201d who seem to think it's cute to teach her these things.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWell, he\u2019s not exactly a young gentleman.\u201d Draco says, instead of calling the kid a little shit like he was going to. \u201cBut his bad behavior doesn\u2019t excuse yours young lady.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019d Jeremy even do that got you so worked up sweetie?\u201d Harry says, working on his own coat. \u201cYou\u2019ve been getting a lot better at not lashing out as much.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDelilah hesitates to answer, dropping her eyes to the floor and scuffing at it with her shoe, and it makes Draco actually worried about the situation instead of just mildly annoyed.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nTheir little girl is a firecracker, she\u2019s fierce and opinionated and confident. She\u2019s a handful, but he loves that she\u2019s like that. He loves that she feels comfortable taking up space and having her thoughts and opinions heard. He thought this was just some normal playground dispute, but if she\u2019s reacting this way\u2026 what if he missed something? Something big, something important?\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSweetie?\u201d Harry asks again, also looking a bit more concerned now.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe said something mean about Papa.\u201d She says, eventually.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry hesitates.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat did he say about Papa?\u201d he asks.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nDelilah fiddles with her clothes nervously.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe said that he heard his mum tell her sister that Papa is a... a death eater whore.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe stumbles over the words a bit, obviously not very familiar with them, but it\u2019s clear what she means.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe said that his mom said that Papa is a slut and a bad person and that Daddy deserves better.\u201d She finishes.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor a moment it feels like everyone in the room is holding their breath. Even little Cyrus is quiet, though that might just be because he\u2019s due for a nap.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco knew this would come up eventually. That eventually they\u2019d have to talk about it. He just thought they\u2019d have more time.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe sighs.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHarry, will you go put Cy down for his nap?\u201d Draco says, and does his best to make his tone gentle and warm. \u201cI think Delilah and I need to talk.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Harry asks, even as he comes over to take their son. \u201cI could-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHarry.\u201d Draco says, a little firmer. He smiles at his mate and pulls him in for a kiss. \u201cI\u2019m okay. I\u2019ve got this.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry looks a little starry eyed when he pulls away from the kiss and Draco loves that he can still get a reaction like that even after having been together all these years.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Harry agrees simply.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBe back in a bit sweetie.\u201d He says to Delilah before heading upstairs with Cyrus in his arms.\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe still looks upset, and a bit confused.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco kneels down beside her and brushes his fingers through her hair, it\u2019s black and wild just like her father\u2019s, just like he\u2019d dreamed it would be.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we go sit down in the living room my love? Then we can talk okay?\u201d He says, trying for a gentle tone.\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe nods and follows him, her hand tiny in his.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe settles on the couch and pulls her onto his lap. She\u2019s old enough that she\u2019s started saying she\u2019s too old for cuddles from her parents, but today she lets him hold her close without complaint.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry someone said that to you.\u201d He starts. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry it upset you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt probably won't be the last time someone says something like that.\u201d He gently informs her. She traces the faded scars on his wrist with her finger.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBecause of the scars?\u201d She asks, her voice small.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes, partially because of the scars.\u201d He says.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe tries to think of how to continue, how to tell her about this. Harry and him have talked about it of course, but Harry trusted him to handle it however he felt was best.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cA long time ago, before you were born, back when your father and I first presented, there was a war. I know you\u2019ve heard of it before.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe nods, watching him intently with grey eyes that match his own.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cGrandpa and I, we made some bad decisions during the war.\u201d He continues. \u201cWe chose the wrong side, and by the time we realized it\u2026 we were stuck.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI was a death eater. I did some bad things.\u201d He rubs his thumb over her cheek and she leans into his touch. \u201cNot as many bad things as some people think, but it\u2019s okay if they\u2019re still upset.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cJust because you apologize doesn\u2019t mean someone\u2019s gotta accept it.\u201d She says, parroting something they\u2019ve been trying to teach her.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah that\u2019s right.\u201d He says. \u201cSo that\u2019s the death eater part. The rest of it\u2026\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHow to even start?\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cTowards the end of the war, during the final battle-\u201d He says.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhen Daddy saved the world!\u201d she interjects excitedly.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco rolls his eyes but his voice is fond when he continues.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhen your father was fighting Voldemort, yes, that\u2019s when I presented.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI was alone, Grandma and Grandpa were stuck on the other side of the battlefield and everything was a mess.\u201d He has to pause here to reign in some of his emotions so he doesn\u2019t make her anxious.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSome bad people got a hold of me in all that chaos, and they stole me away.\u201d He says.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDelilah gasps.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThey stole you?\u201d She asks. \u201cFrom grandma and grandpa?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u201cYes. They stole me.\u201d He reiterates. \u201cIt was during that time that I got all these scars. They made me\u2026\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe swallows past the emotions threatening to choke him.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThey were very bad people.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDelilah reaches up to his face, and wipes away tears he hadn\u2019t meant to let fall.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThey hurt you Papa?\u201d She asks.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes, they did.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe looks so upset for him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe smiles at her, even if it causes a few more tears to fall.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s okay, because you know what happened next?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d She asks, hanging on his words.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYour Uncle Ron came to my rescue.\u201d He says.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe lights up with excitement.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cUncle Ron did?\u201d She asks.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYep. He got me out of there. And when the hospital said I was okay to go home he brought me here.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe knows he\u2019s skimming over a lot of the story, but he thinks she\u2019s still a little young to know the details of court proceedings and plenty of the rest of it.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt was hard for me at first, living here with your father.\u201d He says, trying to choose his words carefully.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBecause he\u2019s a gryffindor idiot.\u201d Delilah says, so sure of her answer.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWell, there was that.\u201d Draco agrees, trying not to laugh.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBut it was also because I had been hurt so much, I had begun to believe that that was just how things were.\u201d He tells her. \u201cBut that\u2019s not how your father is. He may be a foolish gryffindor idiot, but he was gentle and kind to me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe taught me how to be a person again. Gave me a place where it was safe for me to figure out who I was after all I had been through.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAnd then you and your brother came along and I\u2019ve never been happier than I am now with all of you.\u201d She giggles when he kisses her on the forehead.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThere are always going to be people who judge me because of my past and because of my scars. But to me, these scars help tell the story of how I got here. And I love here. I love your father, your brother, and you so so much.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe hugs her tight, and she hugs him back.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI love you too Papa.\u201d She says against his chest.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHis heart feels fit to burst with how much he loves her.\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe looks at him thoughtfully when she pulls away from the hug.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI think your scars are cool.\u201d She decides.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAnd next time I see Jeremy I\u2019m going to tell him his mum\u2019s a nosy bitch who should mind her own business.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraco\u2019s jaw drops.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDelilah! That is no way for a young lady to talk.\u201d He reprimands, as she leaps off his lap to run down the hall giggling, narrowly missing running right into Harry as he comes down the stairs.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe reprimand is half hearted, and they all know it.\n"
