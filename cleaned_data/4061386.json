    "text": "\u201cProfessional couple only\u201d the ad said, and normally, this is the point where Dean would shrug and call up some other hunters to do the job- he knows at least a few couples who hunt together. A haunted apartment building would be a walk in the park for them.\nBut when he explains this to Cas over burgers at a roadside diner somewhere in Iowa, Cas frowns slightly. \u201cYou two impersonate FBI agents all the time,\u201d he says, glancing between Sam and Dean. \u201cA \u2018professional couple\u2019 is probably much easier, and no doubt less illegal to impersonate.\u201d\nSam raises his eyebrows in amusement across the table while Dean makes a pained face.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten mistaken as a couple enough to last us a lifetime, thanks,\u201d Dean says dismissively around a mouthful of burger.\n\u201cAs if I would date that,\u201d Sam says, nose wrinkling in distaste as he watches Dean chew. Ignoring Dean\u2019s offended expression and hand on his heart, he drops his eyes back to his laptop screen.\nCas shrugs. \u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d he says.\nDean and Sam both turn to stare at him.\n\u201cDo what?\u201d Dean asks, a sense of impending doom slowly settling in overhead.\n\u201cDate you,\u201d Cas says, looking right at him. \u201cFor the duration of the hunt,\u201d he amends, as Dean feels his face heat.\nOn his side of the booth, Sam makes a noise that sounds like he\u2019s desperately trying to cover up a laugh. Dean kicks him hard under the table, and Sam coughs loudly.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he says, obviously not sorry. Dean wants to deck him.\nDean turns back to look at Cas.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he says firmly, as if that somehow settles it. He takes a sip of coffee, wondering if it\u2019s possible to drown himself in his mug.\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Cas asks.\nDean puts down his mug and rubs a hand over his brow.\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s weird?\u201d He finally comes up with. His face is flaming, and judging by the grin on Sam\u2019s own face, it\u2019s completely obvious.\n\u201cDean, if you\u2019re uncomfortable with same sex relations, I can assure you-\u201d Cas starts, and Sam legitimately laughs out loud as Dean sighs heavily, holding out a hand to shut Cas up.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely not about that,\u201d he snaps, annoyed that he can\u2019t actually come up with a reason why this is a terrible idea.\u00a0\nCas is looking at him with solemn eyes.\n\u201cPeople are dying, Dean,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have no real idea what\u2019s going on, and without my grace to aid us, this may be our only way to put a stop to it.\u201d\nFor fuck\u2019s sake, Dean thinks. Of course when Cas puts it like that he just feels like an asshole for saying no.\u00a0 He catches Sam\u2019s eye across the table, and Sam watches him carefully, no trace of his previous mirth there.\nDean sighs again, this time in defeat.\n\u201cFine,\u201d he grouses, stomach squirming. He claps Cas on the shoulder. \u201cLet\u2019s go buy a haunted apartment in Vermont\u2026 honey.\u201d\n***\nThey drive back to Kansas first, arriving at the bunker in the early morning. All Dean wants is to conk out for the next four hours, but instead, he shuffles into his bedroom and starts repacking his duffel with clean clothes. They called the landlord from the car, setting up an appointment two days from now. When she mentioned for them to email her their references, Dean almost hung up right then and there, but managed to smile through the inanity of it all. It\u2019s easy enough to make sure all the \u201creferences\u201d route back to Sam, and Sam promises to give him and Cas glowing reviews.\n\u201cI promise,\u201d Sam says, adopting a terrible accent and fluttering his eyelashes, \u201cThose two boys were the nicest, gayest couple I\u2019ve ever seen. They just loved to hold hands. That one taller fella was also big into PDA. There was nothing he liked more than laying a big wet one on his boyfriend for the whole world to-\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to murder you,\u201d Dean says. \u201cI\u2019m literally going to shove you out of this moving car while we\u2019re doing 70 on the freeway and I\u2019m going to stop, back up over you, and then run you over again.\u201d\nSam rubs tears of amusement out of his eyes.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he says, (again, not sounding so sorry), \u201cIt\u2019s not every day I get to watch my overcompensating, macho brother squirm this much.\u201d\nDean glances up at the rear view mirror, making sure Cas is still zonked out in the backseat.\n\u201cI already said it wasn\u2019t about that,\u201d he says, suddenly not in the mood for joking anymore. This really is a terrible idea, but there\u2019s no way he\u2019d ever tell Cas the real reason why.\n\u201cI know,\u201d Sam says, serious again. \u201cI figured you\u2019d rather me rib you than actually try and talk to you about it, god forbid.\u201d\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re only sort of right,\u201d Dean says, reaching to snap on the radio. He keeps it low enough not to wake Cas, but definitely loud enough to deter conversation. \u201cI\u2019d rather not talk about it at all.\u201d\n***\nSam, the lucky bastard, has the luxury of sleeping on their long ass haul to Vermont, passed out in the back seat with his duffel bag as his pillow. Cas sits in the passenger seat, notebook in hand.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realize there\u2019d be an interview,\u201d he says, idly clicking his pen.\n\u201cYeah, well, it\u2019s to stop people from doing exactly what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Dean says. \u201cTo make sure we\u2019re really a-\u201d he stumbles over the word for a moment, but forces himself to get his head in the game. \u201ccouple,\u201d he finishes, swallowing. He may as well get used to it for the time being.\nAfter clearing his throat, Dean says, \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be too hard to tweak our backstory. We have known each other for a long time. We should probably just\u2026 leave out the part where you rescued me from hell.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the apocalypse,\u201d Cas adds.\n\u201cAnd the war in heaven,\u201d Dean continues.\n\u201cAnd the leviathans.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d Dean acquiesces, \u201cMaybe it\u2019ll take a lot of tweaking.\u201d\nHe drums his fingers on the steering wheel as he underthinks. He\u2019s settled on the simple principle of trying not to overthink this whole thing. He just wants to do the job and get it done. So what if he\u2019s pretending to date Cas? They\u2019ve been through tons of shit together, it can\u2019t be that hard to fake an attraction towards the guy.\nHe glances at Cas out of the corner of his eye, struck by the way the sun highlights his profile.\nYeah, that\u2019s a real fake attraction you got going there, buddy, Dean tells himself, gritting his teeth. The fakest.\nHe turns on the radio low, hoping it\u2019ll distract him from the task at hand, but no dice. Deciding to bite the bullet, he gives in and says, \u201cYou really don\u2019t find anything weird about this?\u201d he gestures between the two of them. \u201cAbout us doing this?\u201d\nCas shrugs. \u201cI guess I don\u2019t have the same hang-ups as you do about this,\u201d he says calmly, clicking his pen again. \u201cIt\u2019s just another hunt.\u201d\n\u201cRight, yeah, I get that,\u201d Dean says, even though he totally doesn\u2019t. He decides to pick at the wound once more, \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 do you really think we can pull this off? I don\u2019t even know if I can be a good fake boyfriend to be honest.\u201d\n\u201cWell can I fake being in love with you?\u201d Cas says wryly, as if he\u2019s sharing some kind of inside joke with himself. \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to do our best.\u201d\nThat\u2019s a fun context to put the L-word in. Dean needs a beer. \u00a0\n\u201cFor the hunt,\u201d Dean says sardonically, as if he\u2019s making a toast. \u201cThis damn ghost better be one for the ages.\u201d\nCas taps his pen against the notebook.\n\u201cTo even get to the ghost we need that backstory,\u201d he tells Dean. \u201cSo where would you like to start?\u201d\n***\nThe Official (Totally Fake) Epic Love Story of Dean and Castiel started on September 18th, 2008 (not that their future landlord needs to know the exact date, \u00a0but what the fuck, Cas supplied it so they may as well write it down).\n\u201cEw, did you really just call our love story \u2018epic\u2019?\u201d Dean asks, wrinkling his nose. \u201cDon\u2019t tell the landlord that during the interview.\u201d\nCas underlines the word \u201cepic\u201d on the first page of his notebook, Dean assumes, just to annoy him.\n\u201cOkay, so we got the time, what about the place?\u201d Dean asks. \u201cWhere did we meet on September 18th, 2008?\u201d\n\u201cHell,\u201d Cas says promptly.\n\u201cThe fake story, Cas.\u201d\nCas grumbles. \u201cI don\u2019t like changing our story,\u201d he says. \u201cIt feels disingenuous.\u201d\nDean rolls his eyes. \u201cMaking up a fake story isn\u2019t going to change the real one, dumbass. We can\u2019t just walk in there and start spouting hell-talk. It upsets the normal people.\u201d\n\u201cAnd of course,\u201d Cas says neutrally, \u201cOur real story isn\u2019t a love story.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026 true,\u201d Dean says after a moment\u2019s hesitation. He\u2019s looking at Cas, but as soon as Cas catches him looking, he suddenly becomes very interested in staring out the windshield.\u00a0\n\u201cOur story is one of friendship and faith and devotion,\u201d he says, looking out the passenger side window. \u201cAnd family,\u201d he adds after a moment, almost shyly.\nAnd those are all very nice things, and things Dean treasures dearly, that\u2019s true. But it also somehow seems inadequate to describe what he feels for Cas.\nDean nods along, knowing he could probably say something very after school special here, but catches himself at the last second.\n\u201cOur story is also how you suck at vacuuming,\u201d he says instead, \u201cAnd how you always watch the history channel just so you can point out when they\u2019re wrong.\u201d\nCas snaps his gaze back to Dean\u2019s and narrows his eyes in an \u2018oh so THAT\u2019S how you\u2019re gonna play this\u2019 look.\n\u201cInteresting,\u201d he muses, \u201cBecause I thought our story was about how you always steal the last piece of pizza without asking if anyone else wants it.\u201d\nDean shrugs, unperturbed. \u201cSorry Cas, but as a former angel of the lord I figured you\u2019d understand survival of the fittest.\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t aware hoarding the last piece of pizza was considered \u2018fit\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe not, but it is awesome.\u201d He raises his eyebrows at Cas. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to fight me on that, but I\u2019d think twice about it.\u201d\n\u201cYou just said it yourself, Dean, I\u2019m a former angel of the lord. It\u2019s you who should be thinking twice about fighting me.\u201d\n\u201cNo worries, darlin\u2019,\u201d Dean drawls, \u201cWe\u2019ll have plenty of time to settle just who should be thinking twice about fighting who in Vermont.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll hold you to that,\u201d Cas says, \u201c\u2026 dear.\u201d\nDean\u2019s been calling Cas pet names partly as a joke and partly to get in character for this whole charade, but hearing Cas offer him one in return is so bizarre that he laughs loud enough to wake Sam up in the backseat.\n\u201cWuzgoin\u2019on?\u201d he mumbles, face completely obscured by his hair.\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Dean grins at him in the rear view mirror, \u201cMom and Dad are just exchanging playful banter.\u201d\n***\nThey switch off driving in Springfield, Illinois, and Dean pretends- as he always does- to be grumpy when he hands the keys off to Cas, but really, he\u2019s tired as fuck and the lines on the road were starting to waver so he reigns in the usual complaining. As they pass each other in front of the car, Cas briefly rests his hand on Dean\u2019s shoulder in a simple, comforting gesture, and Dean swears it buzzes for the next twenty miles.\nThey continue to work on their backstory, but it\u2019s proving to be more difficult than Dean thought. He suggests everything from meeting in a coffee shop to accidentally receiving each other\u2019s mail, but no matter what he suggests, Cas shoots him down.\n\u201cMaybe something symbolic,\u201d Cas thinks out loud, arm resting casually on the steering wheel. \u201cWhat place on earth would you liken to hell?\u201d\n\u201cThis car ride,\u201d Dean mumbles petulantly, before sighing and saying, \u201cFuck, Cas, I dunno. Who cares.\u201d\nCas glances at him.\n\u201cYou\u2019re very tired,\u201d he observes.\n\u201cOh, am I?\u201d Dean says sarcastically, \u201cI\u2019ve just been awake for the past 48 hours. I didn\u2019t realize.\u201d\n\u201cDo you want to stop at a motel?\u201d Cas asks. \u201cOur appointment isn\u2019t until Wednesday. We have time.\u201d\nDean slumps down in his seat, waving a hand vaguely. \u201cYeah, sure. Whatever.\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t mean to be so up and down on Cas, and he thinks he\u2019ll be better after actually getting some sleep, but this whole endeavor is kind of wigging him out. He\u2019s trying not to overthink it, and he\u2019s trying to be cool about it, but it\u2019s hard. Fake dating the person you probably-maybe want to be real dating is a pretty tricky situation.\nWhen they pass the nearest road sign, Cas squints at it before saying, \u201cAshland is 100 miles away. Is that okay?\u201d\n\u201cSounds good, chief,\u201d Dean says, closing his eyes and running a hand down his face. It\u2019s quiet for a few minutes in the car, the only sound the engine rumbling under them. Dean imagines what it\u2019s going to be like, house hunting with Cas. Potentially picking out drapes with Cas. What the fuck.\n\u201cDean,\u201d Cas says quietly, \u201cIf you\u2019re really this uncomfortable, I\u2019m sure we could find another way.\u201d\nDean doesn\u2019t open his eyes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Cas,\u201d he says.\n\u201cAre you su-\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Dean says. \u201cI\u2019m sure. A little late for cold feet, don\u2019t you think? We\u2019re about to move in together.\u201d\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Cas says, though he offers a reconciliatory huff of laughter and Dean actually cracks a smile.\nThey lapse back into silence again until Dean has an idea.\n\u201cMaybe we don\u2019t have to change our story,\u201d he says.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nDean sits up, grabbing the notepad and pen off the seat beside him.\n\u201cMaybe we can turn it into a love story,\u201d he says, and it\u2019s only after he\u2019s started writing that he realizes what he\u2019s said. He thinks the tips of ears turn pink, but if Cas notices, he doesn\u2019t say anything.\n***\nThe motel in Ashland is unsurprisingly underwhelming, and Sam is the only one grumbling about the \u201cexecutive decision\u201d made while he was conked out to stop for the night.\n\u201cYeah, well, the big boys were doing actual work while you were snoozing,\u201d Dean says, \u201cSo you don\u2019t get a vote.\u201d\n\u201cYou guys were writing a self-insert love story,\u201d Sam gripes as they make their way to their room. \u201cI was the one who did all the research on this case in the first place.\u201d\nDean turns around so he can roll his eyes at Cas, and Cas just raises an eyebrow in reply.\nNone of it means anything, because five minutes after they get in the room, Sam sprawls on the bed nearest the door, once again dead to the world. Dean scoffs, tempted to throw a pillow at his brother\u2019s head.\n\u201cGuess we\u2019re sharing tonight,\u201d he says as neutrally as possible. Then, he tacks on weakly, \u201cIt\u2019ll be good practice, I guess. Sleep together before we\u2026\u201d he trails off. \u201cSleep together. Or. Pretend to.\u201d he finishes lamely.\nEmbarrassed, he pulls off his shirt and grabs his toiletry bag out of his duffel.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to shower,\u201d he announces, heading into the bathroom before Cas has a chance to respond. He closes the door behind him, turning the shower on before he brushes his teeth to give it a minute to warm up. In old motels like these, the warm water tends to take its time.\nHe stares at himself in the rapidly fogging mirror.\n\u201cC\u2019mon, Dean,\u201d he says to his reflection. \u201cIt\u2019s just a job.\u201d A job that leaves dangerous ideas lingering in the margins. A job that dredges up feelings Dean thought he had under control. But all in all, just a job. He\u2019s playing a part. Simple.\nHe steps into the shower once it\u2019s warmed up, allowing the day\u2019s travel to wash off him. He uses the cheap complimentary shampoo and soap, at first ignoring how his dick perks up in interest as he runs soapy hands over his chest, coaxing his nipples to harden beneath his ministrations. Naturally, his first thought is ordering himself not to think about Cas, which then leads to him thinking about Cas.\nBeing around Cas always seems to leave him on simmer at least, some kind of lowkey arousal that sits warm and content in his belly. It started a long time ago, before the apocalypse even, but he\u2019s always done his best to ignore it. Not ignore it as in not jerk off to it because he\u2019s done that more times than he can count, but ignore that every time he comes with Cas\u2019 name on his lips, he\u2019d much rather Cas was the one to hear it instead of the bare walls of a skeevy motel bathroom.\nAnd now, the bullshit domestic fantasies have started to wiggle their way in. It got bad enough once Cas fell permanently and came to live with them in the bunker, but this? Actually buying an apartment together, even if it\u2019s only temporary? His knees are weak with it. He can\u2019t believe it. He\u2019s going to be playing house with Castiel, former angel of the fucking lord.\nEven thinking about it sends little sparks sputtering through him, and his soapy palm closes around his eager dick in response. He gives his dick a couple pulls, imagines him and Cas actually sharing a bed together. Not like in motels like these where when they share, there\u2019s a very firmly drawn line down the center that neither of them are allowed to cross, but the kind of bed sharing where Dean can follow the body heat to his heart\u2019s content, can slip an arm around Cas and kiss the back of his neck whenever he wants.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nHe presses his free palm to the shower wall, swallowing every noise that threatens to burst out of him when he thinks of Cas\u2019 hand in place of his own. As a kid who grew up in motel rooms and was thus stuck with dealing with his sexual awakening in said motel rooms shared with his brother and father, he\u2019s long since learned the art of quietly jacking himself off. He\u2019s certainly not perfect, has slipped up more than once and had it lead to an awkward conversation or two. There was even that time back when Cas was still an angel a couple years ago and he had said Cas\u2019 name a little too loud while in the moment. Five minutes later, once all the evidence had been neatly discarded and Dean was in the middle of cracking open a beer, Cas had appeared in all his rumpledness, asking why Dean had called for him. His genius response at the time had been, \u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d with a guilty glance towards the garbage can where he had thrown the tissues he used to clean himself up.\nSince then, though, he\u2019s been extra careful. With Cas\u2019 mojo gone at least the danger of Cas popping up at random intervals has disappeared, but the guy has ears. And eyes. He\u2019s pretty savvy, so Dean tries to be discrete.\nHe\u2019s not after anything special tonight. This is more of a necessity than anything, because the last thing Dean needs when platonically sharing a bed with Cas is to wake up in the morning with a raging hard-on tenting the goddam covers. It\u2019s almost perfunctory, the way he jacks himself, a simple flick of the wrist and a fondle of the balls. The orgasm is definitely not the most satisfying he\u2019s ever had, but it takes the edge off, and that should hopefully get him through the night. He stands under the spray for another minute or so, making sure all the jizz has washed down the drain because the last thing he needs is for Cas to slip in the shower because Dean doesn\u2019t know how to clean up after himself. He makes sure to leave Cas a couple minutes of hot water as well, cause he\u2019s just such a swell guy. He towels off, wraps it around his waist, and gathers his clothes in a pile. He exits the bathroom, only to find Cas already asleep on the side of their bed closest to the wall, and Dean rolls his eyes fondly.\nAfter searching through his duffel for a moment he comes up with some cotton pajama pants and simple white t-shirt, and quickly slips them on, hanging his towel up on the rack behind the bathroom door. Not too long after they wrapped up the Mark of Cain business, Dean started actually sleeping in honest to god pajamas. After an adjustment period of feeling weird without his lower half being wrapped in denim at all times, he actually started to enjoy it. It helps him disassociate from the shit he sometimes has to do during the day, and he thinks that it\u2019s even helped the nightmares ease off a bit.\nCas, on the other hand, has passed out in his clothes on top of the covers. Dean considers waking him up to tell him to at least change, but instead he just ends up sliding into bed, fighting momentarily with the covers Cas is sleeping on top of. He can just make out Cas\u2019 outline in the dark of the room, and thinks about how he\u2019s told himself over and over that this is enough. That he can live with just this and he\u2019ll be happy.\nThen, apparently he pulls the covers too hard because he feels a hand swat at his face and an irritated, gravelly voice from beside him say, \u201cstop stealing the covers, Dean.\u201d\nDean sputters in indignation and hisses across the bed, \u201cYou\u2019re the one on the covers you fuckin\u2019 doofus!\u201d\nThere\u2019s an annoyed sigh, and Cas shimmies up toward his pillow, pulling at the covers until he manages to slide under them like a normal person, grumbling in quiet Enochian the whole time.\n\u201cYou better not be cursing me out in a language I can\u2019t understand,\u201d Dean warns from his side of the bed.\nCas\u2019 response is, unsurprisingly, exasperated and in Enochian. He ends it with a prickly, \u201cShut up and go to sleep, Dean.\u201d Which almost makes Dean laugh because as annoying as Cas can be when he\u2019s unceremoniously woken up, his irritation is also often hilarious.\n\u201cOur first night sleeping together and you\u2019re already nagging me I can\u2019t believe it,\u201d Dean says, amused, keeping his voice low so he doesn\u2019t wake Sam too. \u201cAre you gonna banish me to the couch?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Cas says, and Dean can picture his eyes narrowing in the dark. \u201cI\u2019m just going to physically knock you out of this bed. You can sleep wherever you want after that.\u201d\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like something a loving boyfriend would say,\u201d he tsks. It\u2019s so much easier to lie here in the dark and joke about it. He tries not to worry about the actual sleeping arrangements they\u2019re going to decide on once they get the apartment.\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Cas says, \u201cIt\u2019s something an annoyed boyfriend would say.\u201d\n\u201cI love you too, babe,\u201d Dean says, and it\u2019s supposed to be a glib joke but even he can hear the way his voice wavers. \u00a0\u00a0\nCas is silent for a minute before saying a quiet, \u201cGoodnight, Dean.\u201d Thanks to the slight jostling of the bed, Dean knows that Cas rolls over almost immediately, putting his back to him.\nHe stares at the ceiling and tries to remind himself that he\u2019s a professional, goddammit (or as professional as a hunter can ever get, at least). He\u2019s used to playing a part. He\u2019s good at playing a part.\nJust play the part, he tells himself.\u00a0\u00a0\n***\nHe wakes up in the morning and the very first thing he notices is that he doesn\u2019t have morning wood, which is great. He praises himself for his forethought in the shower last night.\nThe next thing he notices is that he\u2019s lying in a wet spot. When he opens his eyes, he finds himself turned towards Cas, head on the inner corner of his pillow. Cas is turned away from him again, still seemingly asleep. In the bathroom, Dean can hear Sam brushing his teeth.\nHe sits up, rubbing at his eyes. It\u2019s gross, but he assumes he just fucking drooled all over the place in the night. However, when he moves to rub any \u2013ew- dried drool off his cheek, he\u2019s surprised to find there isn\u2019t any there which is\u2026 weird. And then he looks back down at his pillow and where he was lying on it- aka pretty damn close to the person he\u2019s currently sharing a bed with- and he finds his suspicious gaze landing on Cas.\nOn a hunch (a hunter\u2019s hunch, no less) he grabs the pillow that Cas is currently sleeping on and drags it out from under him. Cas makes a sound like an angry cat, but Dean ignores him as he examines the pillow, and sure enough, it won\u2019t take a montage from a procedural drama to figure out that the drool on Cas\u2019 pillow is the same as the drool on Dean\u2019s.\nDean makes a sound that could probably be described as \u201cdeeply offended\u201d and starts hammering Cas with his own pillow.\n\u201cYou drooled on my pillow you piece of shit!\u201d Dean yells, punctuating each word with a smack of the pillow.\nSam chooses this moment to stick his head out of the bathroom to see what all the commotion is about, toothbrush in hand and toothpaste all over his mouth.\n\u201cHey,\u201d he says, \u201cwhat the fuck\u2019s-\u201d\nHe\u2019s interrupted when Cas- who Dean honestly thought he\u2019d just beat into submission with the pillow- sits up, steals his pillow, and wacks Dean hard enough with it that he literally careens off the mattress and into the space between the two beds.\nThere\u2019s about three seconds of silence, and then Cas casually says from his perch on the bed, \u201cI warned you.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026 Okay then,\u201d Sam says curtly from the doorway, stepping back into the bathroom. He shuts the door behind him this time.\nOnce he actually catches his breath, Dean rolls over onto his back, once again stuck staring at the motel ceiling. Cas\u2019 head pops over the side of the bed and he watches Dean carefully.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he says, \u201cSometimes I forget I\u2019m still a little bit too strong for you.\u201d He offers a hand down to help Dean up, but Dean doesn\u2019t miss the shadow of a smirk on his face. His hair looks like he just stuck his finger in a wall socket, and Dean wants to run his fingers through it.\n\u201cFuck you,\u201d Dean bites, but he takes the hand anyway, using it to pull himself up. He certainly won\u2019t forget the first time he watched Cas as a human take Sam down in about three seconds in an arm wrestling match. It was absolutely hilarious until Cas managed to beat Dean even faster. They\u2019re not sure if Jimmy was a closet superman or if whatever residual grace is leftover in Cas helps him out, but either way, it\u2019s gotten them out of some sticky situations in the past (and is also great for vacuuming under heavy furniture).\nDean\u2019s thought about alternative uses for that strength before, but has kept it confined mostly to showers and when he\u2019s alone behind a locked door.\nHe trundles over to his duffel, dusting himself off with as much dignity as he can muster, grabbing a clean shirt and his jeans from yesterday.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to get breakfast,\u201d he says over his shoulder, \u201cYou comin\u2019?\u201d He turns around when Cas doesn\u2019t answer, only to find him asleep again on what looks like Dean\u2019s pillow. He chuckles while simultaneously trying to ignore the fondness blossoming in his chest.\n\u201cI\u2019ll come,\u201d Sam says as he walks out of the bathroom, \u201cAs long you\u2019re done with pillow fights for the time being.\u201d\n\u201cYou keep that tone up little bro and I\u2019ll sic Cas on you.\u201d They both turn to where Cas is still snoozing, looking way too unassuming. \u201cHe\u2019s lethal with a pillow.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind,\u201d Sam snorts as he heads out the door.\nDean grabs the Impala\u2019s keys off the desk and is just about to follow suit when Cas calls out from behind him, \u201cCoffee, please. A lot.\u201d\n\u201cI know your order,\u201d Dean says, \u201cBe back soon.\u201d\n***\nAs they\u2019re waiting for coffee and breakfast sandwiches at a local caf\u00e9, Sam keeps sending furtive looks Dean\u2019s way, and Dean\u2019s been steadfastly ignoring them for the better part of twenty minutes. Between the drive here and the actual waiting time, he feels like he deserves some kind of award for once again refraining from kicking Sam out of his car.\nFinally, when Sam starts adding smugness to the looks, Dean snaps.\n\u201cWhat, Sam?\u201d He snaps. \u201cTake a fucking picture, Jesus.\u201d\nSam shrugs high enough that he practically touches his ears, and it\u2019s literally the most obvious tell in the world. Dean rolls his eyes.\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Sam says. \u201cNothing at all.\u201d\n\u201cYou can walk back to the motel,\u201d Dean threatens.\u00a0\nSam runs a hand through his hair, obviously deciding on whether to actually say anything or not. Eventually, he cracks.\n\u201cI\u2019ve just been\u2026 thinking,\u201d he says.\n\u201cThinking,\u201d Dean echoes.\n\u201cYeah, thinking.\u201d\nThey stare at each other in silence until Dean says, very slowly, \u201cThinking what, Sam?\u201d\nSam keeps a very straight face as he says, \u201cWell, y\u2019know. I just thought it was weird that when we took this case we didn\u2019t bother considering all the options.\u201d\nDean exhales, trying to stay relaxed enough not to alarm the other early morning customers.\n\u201cAll the options,\u201d Dean repeats.\nSam shrugs again. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says simply.\nDean shakes his head. \u201cSorry, Sam, if you\u2019ve finally decided you fake wanna get with this-\u201d he gestures to himself, \u201cthat ship has sailed.\u201d\nSam makes a face. \u201cEw. No.\u201d He shakes himself, as if trying to get rid of an ugly mental picture. \u201cNo, what I was saying was\u2026\u201d and that tone starts revealing itself again, the one Sam adopts when he\u2019s about to be a little shit that Dean hates. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to fake date Cas, then, whatever. I could always step in. I\u2019d have no problem fake dating Cas.\u201d\nRecord scratch.\nDean jerks so hard at that suggestion that he sends the salt shaker on their table flying halfway across the restaurant before he manages to get himself under control. He gapes at Sam for a full ten seconds before going to retrieve the (thankfully unopened) shaker, fully aware that there\u2019s more than one pair of eyes on the guy who just hulked out at like 7 in the morning in a local coffee shop. He slides back into his seat, making sure to put the shaker on the far side of the table. He coughs awkwardly.\n\u201cUm. Yeah.\u201d he stammers. \u201cWell, whatever. It\u2019s fine. Cas and I- Cas and I have already worked out\u2026 some stuff. Y\u2019know. Our story and everything. So it wouldn\u2019t even\u2026 make sense really\u2026 In fact I think\u2026 I think we\u2019ve got it covered, frankly, so\u2026 Yeah.\u201d He clears his throat.\nSam stares at him in disbelief.\n\u201cWow,\u201d he says, nodding. \u201cJust wow.\u201d\nSomeone behind the counter calls their order number, and Dean practically jumps at the chance to go get it. As he\u2019s getting up his foot catches on the corner of their booth and he almost face plants in the middle of the aisle, but manages to catch himself at the last second. He moves his ass away as fast as possible, Sam\u2019s muttered, \u201cJesus Christ, Dean,\u201d following him all the way up to the counter. He\u2019s flustered enough that when the girl tells him to enjoy his sandwich he replies with \u201cYou too\u201d.\nHe lets Sam drive back to the motel only so he can glare at him the whole time without worrying about crashing into a lamppost.\n***\nBy the time they get on the road again, Dean\u2019s calmed himself down to maybe 150% power, and the speed and gusto with which he\u2019s inhaling coffee probably isn\u2019t helping much. Sam keeps looking at him weird from the passenger seat, and Cas stares out the back window pensively, like he\u2019s in some kind of sad music video or something.\nBoyfriend, Dean thinks, because he\u2019s trying to get used to the idea. Cas is my boyfriend. My fake boyfriend. But of course he won\u2019t introduce Cas as his \u201cfake boyfriend\u201d. As far as their soon-to-be landlord is concerned, Cas and Dean are boyfriends. Real, bona fide, probably-have-sex-at-least-twice-a-week-and-bicker-over-stupid-shit boyfriends. Even the idea of someone looking at the two of them and thinking that is\u2026 Dean glances at Cas in the rear view mirror.\nOverwhelming, is the word he\u2019s looking for.\n\u201cI can hear you overthinking from here,\u201d Sam mutters. \u201cYou need to chill, Dean. It\u2019s just a fucking job.\u201d\nDean scoffs. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who\u2019s been giving me shit about this job since we decided it was a good idea.\u201d\n\u201cNone of our ideas are ever good,\u201d Sam says, which, well, true. He glances in the rear view mirror to make sure Cas\u2019 attention is still elsewhere and then says, \u201cHey, think of it as a trial run. Y\u2019know, thirty day money back guarantee?\u201d\nDean feels his eyes widen and his pulse spike.\n\u201cW-what?\u201d he stammers. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what you\u2019re talking\u00a0 abou- y\u2019know what, Sam? Fuck you.\u201d\nSam puts his hands up in surrender. \u201cIt was just a suggestion,\u201d he says.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s just a suggestion?\u201d Cas asks from the backseat, and Dean\u2019s brain stops working for a second, before restarting with a cough and the sound of a bolt falling out of place somewhere.\n\u201cHow long it would take you to butt into our conversation,\u201d Dean retorts.\nSam rolls his eyes. \u201cJust figuring out the fastest way to get to Vermont,\u201d he tells Cas, throwing a bitchy look Dean\u2019s way.\n\u201cWe agreed taking I-90 was the fastest, didn\u2019t we?\u201d Cas asks, somewhat confused. It still throws Dean, sometimes, how familiar Cas has become with the roads crossing America.\n\u201cIt is, and we did,\u201d Sam says pointedly. \u201cDean\u2019s just being his usual difficult self and trying to take the long way round.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake, Sam,\u201d he grumbles. Before Cas can start chirping at him about I-90, he holds up a hand. \u201cI got it, Cas,\u201d he says. \u201cI-90 it is.\u201d He glares daggers at Sam, who ignores him. Dean glances at the clock on the dashboard and grits his teeth.\n\u201cAmazing,\u201d he says, \u201cOnly another eight hours to go.\u201d\n***\nFinally, they make it to Highbury, Vermont. Population just over 2000. Quaint. Homey. And apparently pretty damn haunted.\u00a0 They grab dinner at a local Italian joint, settling themselves into a booth as far as possible away from the dinner rush.\nDean\u2019s about to slide in next to Sam, mostly because he\u2019s still wigged from the car ride and has apparently regressed back to a sixth grade mentality, but Sam raises an eyebrow high enough that he relents, taking his usual seat next to Cas and trying not to be a grumpy asshole about it (usually that\u2019s Cas\u2019 shtick, though Dean\u2019s hardly a stranger to being both grumpy and an asshole).\u00a0\n\u201cNow that we\u2019re in town, you can pretty much consider this the beginning of your cover,\u201d Sam says. He waves a sloppy hand between Dean and Cas. \u201cI now pronounce you boyfriends, or whatever.\u201d\n\u201cWow, that was real heartfelt, Sam. Remind me not to ask you to make a toast at the wedding.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this charade will have to go as far as marriage,\u201d Cas says solemnly, though there\u2019s a lilting undercurrent in his tone that\u2019s become a tell for Cas\u2019 sarcasm in the past few years.\n\u201cNot ready for an old ball and chain, huh?\u201d Dean asks, boffing Cas on the shoulder and trying to keep it casual. \u201cSmart.\u201d\nCas shakes his head. \u201cI don\u2019t understand that idiom,\u201d he muses. \u201cMy understanding of marriage is that you\u2019re supposed to love the person you\u2019re betrothed to. Referring to your significant other as a \u2018ball and chain\u2019 seems unreasonably harsh.\u201d\nDean snorts. \u201cWell if it makes you feel any better my only ball and chain here is sitting right across from us, and we\u2019re probably not getting married any time soon.\u201d\nSam looks like he\u2019s about to kick him under the table, but Dean\u2019s shins are saved by the arrival of their waitress. She\u2019s a young woman, cheery and college aged. After she greets them and takes their orders, she pauses for a moment before saying, \u201cI have to say, I haven\u2019t seen you folks around here before. Just passing through? Or sticking around a while?\u201d\nIt\u2019s a simple question. One Dean\u2019s answered in many a roadside diner to many a charming waitress. But with their current\u2026 situation, he finds himself struck mute, mouth half falling open in what probably isn\u2019t his best look ever.\nInstead, it\u2019s Cas who takes the reigns. \u201cRenting an apartment, actually,\u201d he smiles at her like he doesn\u2019t have a trouble in the world. \u201cIt\u2019s a lovely place to settle.\u201d\n\u201cOh, awesome!\u201d The waitress says. \u201cWelcome to town, guys. I\u2019ll have your order out in a jiffy.\u201d\nAnd that\u2019s it. Frogs didn\u2019t rain from the sky. Volcanos didn\u2019t erupt. Cas didn\u2019t even bother specifying who was doing the renting. Christ, Dean\u2019s heart is beating.\nSmirking slightly at the whole scene, Sam stands up.\n\u201cGotta hit the head,\u201d he says. \u201cBe right back.\u201d\nAs soon as he lumbers off, Cas turns his gaze on Dean.\n\u201cYou\u2019re still having trouble with this,\u201d he states. \u201cYou and I.\u201d\nDean opens his mouth to disagree, but cuts out halfway through because there is really no way to play off the failure of his vocal cords just now. \u201cYeah,\u201d he admits. \u201cI guess I am.\u201d\nCas nods, and Dean swears a flash of hurt crosses his face, but it\u2019s too quick for him to be sure. \u201cI can do the talking from now on,\u201d Cas says, \u201cIf you think it\u2019ll help.\u201d\nDean waves him off.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ll both just\u2026 do a normal amount of talking. Like normal people. Who just happen to be\u2026 dating.\u201d\nCas stares at him reproachfully.\n\u201cSpeaking of, you\u2019re allowed to talk to me, Dean,\u201d Cas says. \u201cIf you\u2019re nervous or if you\u2019re getting cold feet, it doesn\u2019t matter. You can tell me.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well, we all know me,\u201d Dean says weakly, \u201cI\u2019m just a chatty Cathy.\u201d\nCas sighs, scrubbing a hand over his jaw. It\u2019s a habit he picked up from Dean. \u201cSince I fell permanently, I\u2019ve tried my best to be forthcoming,\u201d he says. \u201cYears of watching you and Sam lie to each other coupled with my own various deceptions,\u201d he grimaces. \u201cIt was enough to make me want to at least try to be more honest in all aspects of my life.\u201d\n\u201cI know, Cas,\u201d Dean says, because he really does. Everything from \u201cthat shirt is very ugly, Sam\u201d to something as terrifying as \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll ever be able to explain how much you mean to me, Dean\u201d. Cas has spent the last couple years really not pulling any punches, and for the most part, Dean\u2019s been grateful for the bluntness. Not to mention that he also finds it endearing, and he\u2019s liable to fall in love at least a little bit when someone else insults Sam\u2019s shirts as often as he does.\n\u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d Cas says. \u201cBecause there\u2019s something I\u2019ve failed to mention for a very long time.\u201d\nDean swallows hard, and he can hear the blood pounding in his ears.\n\u201cUh, Cas,\u201d he says, gesturing around at the restaurant, \u201care you sure this is the place to um,\u201d he clears his suddenly very dry throat, \u201cthe place to\u2026 get shit off your chest?\u201d he finishes lamely.\n\u201cWhat I have to say won\u2019t change no matter the setting we\u2019re in,\u201d Cas says determinedly, and Dean\u2019s heart thuds dully against his rib cage.\nHe thinks about getting rid of the Mark of Cain, and Cas\u2019 subsequent fall. He thinks about how Cas held him through the former, and how he did his absolute best to hold Cas through the latter. For probably too long, they traded off sitting at each other\u2019s bedsides, more stubborn than either of them had any right to be. Things were intense for a while, and Dean remembers thinking at the time that maybe it was all going to culminate in\u2026 something. But then he got better and Cas got better, and they had backed off the precipice, no longer held together by the end of the world or the promise of the end of one of their lives. They just became Cas and Dean, and learning how to relate to each other as simply people instead of soldiers or hunters or angels or righteous men turned out to be a lot harder (and easier) than Dean expected.\nFor example, Cas left his dirty socks everywhere. Hardly a crime by any standard, but it sure as hell annoyed Dean.\nBut, more importantly, before Cas decided to go all out with his always honest shtick, he spent a long time telling nobody anything, and would lock himself in his room for days. That particular rough patch lead to Dean saying some things he still regrets to this day, and culminated in Cas slamming the door of the bunker behind him as he disappeared for two weeks without so much as a phone call.\nDean either remembers moments from those weeks crystal clearly or not at all. He remembers the anger that surged through him for those first two days, anger he swore to himself was just leftover remnants of the Mark of Cain, even though even then he knew it was nothing more than an excuse. The anger faded into sick fear fast enough, and he spent the remaining days before Cas returned mourning something he had never had, trying to sort out the relentless waves of emotion that crashed through him without end. The only half-clear memory he has of that time is getting stupidly drunk one night and unloading some kind of epic, slurred speech to Sam that he\u2019s sure would only embarrass himself if he remembered it in its entirety. It\u2019s probably because of that speech (not that Dean\u2019s asked or Sam has mentioned) that Sam\u2019s been so incredibly annoying about him and Cas for the past months.\nThe only reason Dean never chased after Cas after that initial blowout was because Sam begged him to just back off for a while. He gave Dean the whole speech about Cas being in charge of himself, and probably even dropped everyone\u2019s favorite buzzword, free will, into the mix a couple times. To this day, Dean\u2019s still not sure if not going after Cas was the right decision. Despite the conflict between them long being resolved, Dean still finds himself some nights staring up at his bedroom ceiling and wondering.\nIt would have made sense, maybe, when Cas finally came home at the end of two of the longest weeks of Dean\u2019s life, that something would finally happen. \u00a0Dean remembers the way his pulse jumped- much like it currently has as they sit in a restaurant in Highbury, Vermont- as the door opened and he spotted the familiar shape of Cas at the top of the bunker\u2019s stairs, looking windblown and unkempt but alive and here, which were pretty high on Dean\u2019s priority list.\nThey made eye contact, Cas from his perch by the door and Dean down below in the library. Neither of them said a thing. Dean watched like a hawk as Cas made his way down the stairs, the trench coat he left wearing nowhere in sight.\nHe came to a stop in front of Dean, leaving a socially acceptable amount of space between them. His tentative smile was exhausted but genuine when he said, \u201cHello, Dean,\u201d and Dean made a noise that could probably be described as a whimper and dragged Cas into his arms, reminding him of a certain riverbank in Purgatory.\nIf there was ever a time for a something to happen, that was probably it. And it almost did, too. Dean had his arms around Cas and Cas was hugging him just as tightly back, and he could feel Cas\u2019 scruff rasping against his neck and ear and Cas\u2019 hair was tickling his nose. His hands trailed lower, coming to rest in the much more intimate space of Cas\u2019 lower back, and he briefly pressed his lips to Cas\u2019 shoulder, mouth burning through the plaid.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Dean mumbled into his shoulder. \u201cCas, I\u2019m so-\u201d\nCas shushed him, and Dean shuddered as Cas started trailing fingers through Dean\u2019s hair.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry too,\u201d Cas murmured. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have pulled away like that.\u201d\nDean straightened up at that, pulling back to look Cas in the eye though his hands merely moved to Cas\u2019 hips.\n\u201cHey, no,\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t fair, Cas. I was impatient and I didn\u2019t want to wait and I got angry. I was afraid\u2026\u201d he swallowed. \u201cI was afraid you were regretting your decision.\u201d\nCas cocked his head.\n\u201cTo become human?\u201d he clarified. At Dean\u2019s nod, he continued, \u201cDean, this isn\u2019t my first time falling. I knew what I was signing up for, and it was my choice.\u201d\n\u201cI know but-\u201d\nCas shushed him again, this time pressing the pad of his thumb to Dean\u2019s lip. \u201cI should have communicated my distress better, and perhaps you weren\u2019t as patient as you could have been,\u201d he allowed. After a moment, he added, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for walking out on you. If it had been the other way around, I would have hated it.\u201d\nDean let out a breath he didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d been holding, and found himself falling forward into Cas, bumping their foreheads together. For a moment, he just breathed in the space between them, listening to Cas\u2019 steady rhythm.\nThe sound of the front door opening jarred them both to action, Dean taking a good three steps away, feeling like he\u2019d just been electrocuted, while Cas\u2019 head whipped around to greet\u2014Sam, as it turned out, who was just back from town.\nThe somewhat less emotionally charged, but no less happy reunion that took place between Sam and Cas was enough to effectively kill the moment, but ever since then, Dean\u2019s wondered when and if they\u2019d ever get that something after all. \u00a0\nAnd now of all places, Dean wonders if it\u2019s gonna fucking happen in the middle of a fake Italian restaurant while he\u2019s fake pretending to be Cas\u2019 boyfriend.\n\u201cDean, I-\u201d Cas says\u2014\nAnd then Sam slides back into the booth, and Dean has no idea if he wants to kill or kiss his cockblocking baby brother. Sam must have taken a goddam class on significantly timed entrances or something.\n\u201cNo drinks yet?\u201d Sam asks.\nOut of the corner of his eye, Dean watches Cas\u2019 jaw clench.\n\u201cNo, Sam,\u201d Cas says stiffly. \u201cThe waitress has not brought our drinks yet.\u201d\nDean\u2019s feeling more than a little lightheaded at the moment, so his snort of laughter very quickly snowballs into full blown, tear-wiping laughter. People at nearby tables turn to look at him, but Dean doesn\u2019t care. He laughs his jitters out, laughs his nerves out, literally laughs until he\u2019s gasping for breath and Sam and Cas are staring at him with equal parts concern and annoyance.\nOnce he finally gets himself under control, Dean wipes one more tear out of his eye.\n\u201cNo drinks yet, Sammy,\u201d he says, chuckling.\n***\nOnce they get their food, things return to relative normality. Dean drinks beer and Cas carefully examines his garlic bread before taking a bite. The days of everything tasting like molecules are long over for Cas, but he can still be a picky bastard when he wants to be.\nSam\u2019s more focused on his laptop and notes than his (ew) vegetable lasagne because Dean decided to swallow his pride and ask Sam to go over the case again, since (and not that he mentioned this part) he\u2019s been kind of occupied the last couple days with the practical (fake boyfriends) side of their plan instead of the research part. Sam had rolled his eyes but bless his heart had also pulled out his laptop as he was doing so.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cSo this building-the Painter building- you\u2019re going to be renting in was built in the early 1900s,\u201d he explains. \u201cVery. Um. Rustic, from what I can tell. There\u2019s been a renovation or two to add things like air conditioning and electricity over the years, but for the most part, the building remains unchanged.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u201cWhich means there could be about a million things littered around that place that could belong to our ghost,\u201d Dean finishes, taking another pull of beer.\n\u201cI only assume it\u2019s a ghost,\u201d Sam says. \u201cCan\u2019t be sure yet. There\u2019s no evidence of ectoplasm and the place wasn\u2019t built on any kind of burial ground that I can find.\u201d\n\u201cWell I mean, what are our other options?\u201d Dean asks.\n\u201cPretty much whatever you can think of, though I do agree that it\u2019s probably a ghost,\u201d Cas says unhelpfully as he finally takes a bite of the garlic bread. He grimaces for a moment as if expecting to hate it, but he\u2019s obviously pleasantly surprised at the taste and seems to genuinely enjoy it.\nSomething shifts in Dean and he jokes, \u201cThat better not be better than my garlic bread.\u201d\nCas\u2019 gaze flits to him as he swallows. \u201cOf course not,\u201d he says, and Dean suddenly feels too warm.\n\u201cYeah, well\u2026 good,\u201d he says lamely, grabbing his beer for another sip as an excuse to take his eyes off Cas. He\u2019s had a lot more time in the past months to work in the kitchen, honing his cooking skills to something actually halfway decent. Growing up cooking for Sam all the time had given him the creativity he needed, and his year at Lisa\u2019s had filled in whatever he blanks he hadn\u2019t already filled, and the bunker and lack of world ending catastrophe finally gave him the means. Ever since they found the bunker, really, the domesticity has been leaking into Dean, slowly but surely. Cooking for Sam as a kid had been about making sure his little brother didn\u2019t starve, but cooking for Sam (and Cas, and whoever else decides to stop by) as an adult is more than a necessity. It\u2019s something Dean genuinely wants to do. Maybe the reason he always romanticized family dinners was because he never got to have one (if he did, he certainly can\u2019t remember), but either way, nothing quite beats that feeling of sitting down to a supper and providing for his family. Not much warms him more than seeing Cas or Sam truly enjoy something he made.\nSam is looking at the two of them with learned patience, like a teacher waiting for their class to finally get with the program and shut the hell up. When they both turn back to look at him, Sam continues like there was no interruption.\n\u201cSo I\u2019ll scout the town out tomorrow while you two are signing the papers, ask some questions,\u201d he says. He leans forward, dropping his voice just a little. \u201cAll the other falsified papers are good to go, so make sure you bring those with you to the appointment.\u201d\n\u201cYes sir,\u201d Dean says.\nSam rolls his eyes and glances at Cas.\n\u201cCas, make sure you bring them with you to the appointment,\u201d he amends. At Cas\u2019 nod, he continues again at a normal volume. \u201cThe bottom floor of the building used to be a general store, but they converted it in the 30s. The murders that have taken place in the building have been scattered, to say the least. No real pattern that I can find.\u201d He glances at his notepad. \u201cSome men died during the initial building. Then, murders in 1910, 1915, 1917, 1927, 1931, etc. Just random years and different methods of murder. Some were drowned, some had heart attacks, electrocution, stabbings, slit wrists, falling out windows, all kinds of different ways.\u201d\n\u201cSome of those sound like accidents, y\u2019know,\u201d Dean says. \u201cSometimes people just die.\u201d\n\u201cIn a small apartment building in a town like this?\u201d Sam asks. \u201cNot that many people. Besides, there have been a few occasions of people having literal, gaping holes in their chests. That\u2019s definitely no accident.\u201d\n\u201cHearts missing?\u201d Dean asks.\nSam shakes his head.\nDean taps a finger on the table in contemplation.\n\u201cOkay so we got a lot of bad ju ju,\u201d he concludes. \u201cWe don\u2019t know much else, but we know that.\u201d He looks at Cas. \u201cYou ready to fight some ghoulies?\u201d\nCas nods solemnly with a mouth full of garlic bread.\n***\nThey spend the night in a motel on the edge of town that Sam\u2019s going to be staying in while he plays FBI for the duration. Dean spends a second night in a row curled up in a bed next to Cas that\u2019s simultaneously too big and too small. They manage to avoid any more pillow mishaps, but at some point during the night, Dean does wake up to find Cas\u2019 fingertips just barely brushing against his arm. He doesn\u2019t bother rolling away, but by the morning they\u2019re long gone.\nSince \u201cProfessional\u201d was firmly stated in the ad, Dean and Cas do their best to dress for the part. Dean finds himself in a forest green sweater and dark blue jeans, while Cas steps out of the bathroom in a sleek navy button down with the sleeves rolled up to the elbows and black jeans that fit really\u2026 really well. Dean tries not to stare, but one glance is more than enough to get his dick interested.\n\u201cLook at you,\u201d Dean says, practically feeling his pupils dilate. \u201cYou clean up nice.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Cas says vaguely, plucking at his stylishly untucked shirt. \u201cThe man at the department store said it was very \u2018on-trend\u2019.\u201d\nDean snorts, dropping his eyes for a moment as he stares at Cas\u2019 casual brown oxfords. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says, swallowing, \u201cNaturally.\u201d\nSam barges in then with a tray of coffee held in his hand. When he spots Dean and Cas in their new get ups, he grins. \u201cLooking good,\u201d he says, deeply amused. \u201cThat\u2019s definitely how professionals dress on their days off.\u201d\n\u201cOh, shut up,\u201d Dean says, grabbing both his and Cas\u2019 coffees. He hands it back to Cas, and as Cas takes the coffee, their fingers momentarily brush and Dean\u2019s left thinking about how Cas\u2019 fingers felt against his arm in the middle of the night.\nSam rifles through his bag, digging out the papers they need. \u201cOkay,\u201d he says, handing them off to Cas, \u201cEverything has already been finalized over the phone. You two just need to show up and sign on the dotted line. And, obviously,\u201d he hands Dean and Cas two new ID\u2019s. \u201cYour new names.\u201d\nDean is now Leo Stark, and Cas of all people is Steve Winchester.\nDean definitely (definitely) doesn\u2019t mind lending Cas his last name, but he was actually more concerned with Cas\u2019 first choice, since Steve was what he went by when he became human after the angels fell and, frankly, didn\u2019t have a great time. And it was almost entirely Dean\u2019s fault.\nAs they drive back into town, Dean itches absently at his forearm where the Mark of Cain used to be, only because it\u2019s become something of a habit.\u00a0\n\u201cHey,\u201d he says, \u201cAre you sure about the Steve thing?\u201d\nCas looks at him balefully.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019ve already been over this, Dean, and it\u2019s far too late to change it now.\u201d\n\u201cI know, but\u2026\u201d Dean trails off. This is more about his own stubborn guilt than anything. \u201cYou just had such a rough go with that name, I figured you\u2019d choose something\u2026 I dunno. A joke. A musician. Or something that\u2019s important.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, you mean like a man who flies around in a mechanically improbable suit that\u2019s not even made of iron?\u201d\n\u201cOkay, first of all, Tony Stark is awesome. Second, shut up.\u201d\nCas looks down at his lap for a moment before turning to look at Dean again.\n\u201cI chose this first name because it\u2019s practical and I was once used to responding to it. I chose it for convenience.\u201d His expression softens. \u201cIt was the surname I chose that holds meaning for me.\u201d\nDean\u2019s stomach flips, but in a good way. That fluttery sensation in his fingertips is probably just caffeine, though. Maybe.\n\u201cI\u2019ve told you before we can get your name changed,\u201d Dean says, trying to keep his tone from dripping too much sentimentality all over Cas. \u201cI mean, probably not legally. But close enough that as far as anyone will ever know, you\u2019re a Winchester.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Cas says. \u201cAs it always has, the gesture means a lot.\u201d\nDean claps him on the shoulder. \u201cMy name is your name, Cas.\u201d\n***\nHighbury is pretty homey, as far as homey goes. Quaint main street with red bricked, squat buildings that sport cheerful, handmade signs. Trees that are probably very pretty whenever it\u2019s not the dead of November line the center of the road dividers, and the small downtown area is full of twinkle lights and colorful banners welcoming you to downtown Highbury.\nTheir building is next to an old stone bridge leading out of town, under which flows a happily burbling creek. It\u2019s similar to the rest of the older buildings in town, and absolute prime location. Dean whistles lowly as he pulls into the sparsely populated tenant parking lot out front (all arranged in attractive, tourist-town diagonal lines along the front of the building), leaning forward to glance out the windshield at the place.\n\u201cThis is so\u2026\u201d he says, and then stops because he can\u2019t quite think of the right word.\n\u201cPicturesque?\u201d Cas supplies.\n\u201cI was gonna say it feels like the inside of a snowglobe, but I guess that\u2019ll do, too.\u201d\n\u201cWell then let\u2019s shake things up,\u201d Cas says, grinning, and Dean groans because he walked right into that one.\u00a0\nTheir landlord is a cheerful, nosy blond woman named Helen who almost aggressively forces onto them a plate of lemon squares before they\u2019ve even stepped over the threshold.\n\u201cSteve and Leo, right?\u201d she bubbles, already bustling around to take their coats and hang them up in the nearby closet.\n\u201cThat\u2019s us,\u201d Dean says, trying to keep it casual. His palms are sweating.\n\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d Cas smiles. \u201cHighbury is a lovely town.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d Helen gushes, \u201cI\u2019m just so happy to finally fill this apartment,\u201d she chatters, ushering them over to the kitchen counter where there\u2019s a single paper waiting with a pen lying next to it. Dean\u2019s brain tries to categorize it as ominous, but he tells it to shut up. They still have to have this \u201cmeeting\u201d or whatever to prove that they\u2019re suitable candidates, even though Sam told them it was more of a formality than anything.\nThe apartment building itself is squat and red bricked and blatantly old. As Sam said, it\u2019s definitely rustic. Based on the size of the place, Dean imagines there are maybe fifteen apartments at most, and that\u2019s being generous. The inside is all scuffed wood floors and peeling paint, the furniture not dusty, per say, but dated (hell, the fact that the place came furnished at all was a win for them). The kitchen and living room share the same space, and Dean assumes the hallway off to the left is where the bedroom and bathroom are. He doesn\u2019t know a lot about apartments or the housing market, but he\u2019s pretty sure that under non-haunted circumstances, this thing could fetch a pretty penny.\n\u201cThe last person who lived here died, didn\u2019t they?\u201d Dean asks, starting slow. When Helen\u2019s smile slips off her face, he adds quickly, \u201cWe\u2019re not gonna back out or whatever. Just curious.\u201d\nThat doesn\u2019t seem to appease her much, but Dean assumes she must have some kind of landlord-y obligation to answer their question because she sighs and says, \u201cYes, that\u2019s true. It was very unfortunate.\u201d\n\u201cIt happened, what, six months ago?\u201d Dean asks. \u201cSo you\u2019ve been trying to unload this apartment since then?\u201d\nHelen nods. \u201cBut I assure you, anything that, um. Needed to be replaced was replaced.\u201d\nCas, who\u2019s off examining the living room, meets Dean\u2019s eye knowingly. The last death in here, as far as they could tell from the vague newspaper headlines, was pretty messy. The tenant himself was an apparently non-descript guy, something inoffensive like a desk clerk at a car rental place or something. Hardly a dude with a lot of enemies or a lot of secrets that would put him at risk for a death so gruesome.\n\u201cThis building\u2019s had some pretty bad luck over the years, huh?\u201d Dean asks. \u201cLots of\u2026 accidents.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose,\u201d Helen says, her smile much less genuine than before. She bustles forward into the living room, taking a seat in the arm chair. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind,\u201d she addresses both Dean and Cas, \u201cWe should probably get started.\u201d\nDean relents for now, heading into the living room to join Cas on the couch. He\u2019s about to sit on the opposite end, then realizes that\u2019s probably weird to sit so far away from a significant other? He thinks? He ends up doing a weird little shuffle thing while Cas and Helen stare at him strangely, then overshoots by parking himself probably too close to Cas, but there\u2019s no way he\u2019s moving now.\nHelen tries to plaster a smile back on, and Dean feels kind of like a dick for grilling her within the first five minutes of meeting her. \u201cSo,\u201d she says, glancing between the two of them, \u201cTell me a little bit about yourselves.\u201d\nDean and Cas exchange a look, and Dean clears his throat. Time to pony up.\n\"We, uh, met almost eight years ago,\" he says. \"C- Steve pulled me out of a, um... tight spot. We worked together for a while, er, some diplomatic work. International, I guess you could say.\" Interdimentional, but whatever. Close enough. \"Then we... stopped working together for a while, and... started... again?\"\nYeah, okay, he's going down in flames here. He thought he could do this, but maybe he overestimated himself. He glances at Cas for help, and Cas nods slightly.\n\"You know what?\" Dean smiles at Helen, feeling the corners of his mouth trembling slightly as they struggle to hold the expression in place. \"I'm terrible at telling stories. Steve can tell it way better than I can.\" He's about to pat Cas on the shoulder and then halfway through the gesture thinks, oh god that would be a weird thing for couples to do, wouldn't it? Slapping arms is a buddy thing, like we're fucking buddies who do buddy stuff shit shit shit and amidst his own internal existential crisis, some wires obviously get crossed because instead of thumping Cas on the shoulder he's reaching for his hand instead.\nWhen Dean's hand brushes Cas' palm he immediately allows Dean to lace their fingers together, almost as if the gesture is automatic. Cas does squeeze his hand, Dean assumes, to ask what the fuck he's doing, or maybe, why is your hand so sweaty, but Dean just keeps that stupid fucking smile plastered on his face and says, \"go on, then.\"\nHelen, for what it's worth, indulges them despite the fact they probably look like teenagers fumbling for their first above-clothes grope. She must be really relieved to have moved on from the haunted apartment spiel.\n\u201cWhat Leo is trying to say,\u201d Cas swoops in smoothly (Dean can hear the additional wryness in his voice even if no one else ever could), \u201cis that we\u2019ve been through a lot and we\u2019re ready to settle down.\u201d\nWell, that certainly condenses the story. Dean\u2019s glad he spent so much fucking time sweating over it.\nHelen nods, her smile returning to a more genuine curve.\n\u201cThat\u2019s so nice to hear that someone made it,\u201d she says, and Cas squeezes Dean\u2019s hand again.\n\u201cWith both of us working from home and living in a small town like this, it\u2019ll be a welcome change of pace,\u201d Cas says, his own voice turning content, reverent even, not a trace or sarcasm in sight, \u201cWe used to be on the road a lot.\u201d\nGod, they\u2019d talked this out (minus a few small embellishments on Cas\u2019 part) but Dean didn\u2019t quite realize just how weird this would be, listening to Cas talk about them settling down together. Well, Steve and Leo settling down together, but either way, it throws him. He knew it would be weird to some degree, but he definitely underestimated the strange, stunned pleasure that curls in him at the thought. Back when Cas was still an angel he never ever dared to even think Cas and domesticity in the same sentence, but Cas has taken to humanity with aplomb give or take an existential crisis or two. Dean loves watching Cas be so present, loves watching him garden and read and even bitch endlessly about whatever historical inaccuracies have been ingrained into pop culture\u2019s collective memory. Cas is such a visceral presence. Quiet and unassuming a lot of the time, but underneath it all he\u2019s a live wire. Nothing gets Dean weaker in the knee than when Cas Classic comes out to play, carrying all that intensity of the first night he and Dean met in that barn showering down around him like sparks. There may not be much of a light show anymore, (unless Cas actually decided to rig one up one day, which Dean would definitely not put by him) but his eyes still flash in exactly the same way.\n\u201cThis is a nice town you boys picked,\u201d Helen says, breaking Dean out of (not his first) reverie where he thinks about just how much Cas means to him.\nThere\u2019s no point in beating around the bush. Dean lo-\n\u201cIt is,\u201d Cas says warmly, interrupting Dean mid-thought. \u201cWe\u2019re happy to be here and excited to get settled.\u201d\nHelen nods, obviously satisfied. She stands up, delicately flattening her bright yellow sweater. \u201cLet\u2019s not drag this out any longer, then,\u201d she says, back to her cheerful self, \u201cOf course you two were going to get the place.\u201d\nDean and Cas stand to follow her, and Dean drops Cas\u2019 hand.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he mumbles, wiping his palm on his thigh. Shit, his hand was really clammy.\n\u201cDon\u2019t apologize,\u201d Cas says quietly, \u201cI think that\u2019s what sold her.\u201d He leads Dean into the kitchen where they both sign the paper, and Dean feels like he\u2019s having an out of body experience as he watches himself sign a co-lease with another man\u2019s name. Cas signs after him, and then Helen waves the paper around happily.\n\u201cCongratulations, gentlemen!\u201d she chirps as they walk her to the door. \u201cWelcome to your new home.\u201d\nCas thanks her as she leaves, and as soon as he shuts the door Dean collapses back against it, closing his eyes and scrubbing a hand down his face.\n\u201cHoly shit,\u201d he groans, \u201cThat was exhausting.\u201d\nHe listens as Cas opens the front closet again, and shuts it with a touch too much force.\n\u201cI apologize that this fake relationship has already become so taxing for you,\u201d Cas says, not without bite.\nDean cracks open an eye to stare at him. \u201cWhoa. Are you mad at me?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Cas says passive aggressively.\n\u201cOkay, that sounded a lot like a \u2018yes\u2019\u201d.\nCas takes a deep breath, the lines in his face smoothing out. \u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d he promises Dean, and even though Dean doesn\u2019t completely buy it, he\u2019s willing to put it aside for now. \u201cWe should go grab our things from the car.\u201d\nThey do exactly that, peering furtively around as they lug more salt back up the stairs than any couple could ever need.\n\u201cIf anyone asks, we\u2019re just into freaky sex stuff,\u201d Dean says, and Cas rolls his eyes.\n\u201cWhat kind of freaky sex stuff could we possibly be into with fifty pounds of salt?\u201d Cas asks.\n\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d Dean amends. \u201cWe tell them we just drink a lot of tequila then.\u201d\nThey bring up the iron rods and the shotguns and the salt rounds, and Cas even brings in some kind of purifying incense that he seems convinced will calm any wayward spirits down for a while. Sam and Dean were never big on using incense during hunts (it was a little too witchy for Dean\u2019s taste) but Cas is in tune with nature or whatever, and he\u2019s told Dean more than once that all the purifying properties of things like sage and rosemary and jasmine are just as good at dispelling evil as they are at creating it. According to him, it\u2019s all about how you use it.\nFinally, they bring up duffel bags full of clothes, and Dean drops his on the floor of the living room with a sigh, collapsing onto the couch again.\n\u201cI know I sound like a broken record, but this is so weird,\u201d Dean says. \u201cLike, if you had told me ten years ago that I\u2019d be playing gay house with a former angel of the lord, I think I would\u2019ve shot you just on principle.\u201d\nCas offers a slight huff of laughter as he says, \u201cA lot can change in ten years.\u201d\nDean thinks about where Cas was ten years ago and where he was ten years ago. Cas would\u2019ve been doing who knows what up in heaven, strumming a harp, fighting a war, singing hallelujahs maybe. As for him, ten years ago was 2006. He hadn\u2019t even sold his soul yet.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he says, half in awe. \u201cTime sure flies.\u201d\nCas disappears down the hallway for a moment, and Dean realizes belatedly he hasn\u2019t even seen the bathroom or the bedroom of his new apartment yet. Before he goes, however, he quickly checks under the cushions, but it interrupted by Cas.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to go buy sheets for the bed,\u201d Cas says as he returns to the living room, \u201cToilet paper, towels, soap, things like that.\u201d When he sees Dean fiddling with the couch cushion, he asks, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\nDean puts the cushion back in place in defeat. \u201cChecking for a pull-out.\u201d\nCas just looks at him.\nDean shrugs defensively. \u201cWhat? We don\u2019t have to be a couple when no one\u2019s watching, you know.\u201d\nCas rolls his eyes, letting out an annoyed breath.\n\u201cNo offense, Dean, but can you pull your head out of your ass for like two seconds?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Dean squawks indignantly.\n\u201cFirst of all, your back couldn\u2019t handle a pull-out bed, and it definitely couldn\u2019t handle the couch. Second of all, we\u2019ve shared a bed for the past two nights and multiple times before that. I know you have reservations about the way we\u2019re handling this hunt, but you need to relax, Dean.\u201d\nDean stands up, taking a long, low breath and trying to calm himself. \u201cI know,\u201d he says. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m just\u2026\u201d he licks his lips. \u201cSorry.\u201d\nHe brushes by Cas to grab his jacket out of the closet, wondering idly if he should just go without it in the November chill. It might freeze him to death and save him from the inevitable shitshow this is going to turn into.\nHe\u2019s just shrugged it on when Cas lays a hand on his upper arm.\n\u201cI know this has the potential to be\u2026 awkward,\u201d Cas says, a distinct note of discomfort in his voice, and Dean feels his eyes widen slightly. Is he really going to start the feelings talk right here right now? Dean thought the diner was a one off, but maybe he was wrong. He thinks of every single time something seemed like it was going to happen between them and didn\u2019t.\nCas seems to steel himself. \u201cBut as you said, this is merely a cover. We\u2019re being practical. Professional.\u201d\nDean\u2019s never done a professional thing in his life, but he nods along anyway, ignoring the way his stomach clenches and how tension seems to hover between them like a particularly dense layer of fog.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he agrees, swallowing, \u201cPractical. Professional. Sounds like a Winchester plan of action.\u201d\n***\nAccording to Sam\u2019s text, he\u2019s still kicking around town talking to locals and flashing his badge, so Dean and Cas head out to the Bed Bath and Beyond down Route 7 with list in hand. The car ride doesn\u2019t do much to dissipate the tension in the air between them as they talk only briefly about other things to add to the list. The dull colors of late autumn pass by outside the Impala\u2019s windows and Cas stares determinedly at them, as if trying to will the leaves to drop through the weight of his stare alone.\nOnce they actually head into the store, though, things instantly take a turn for the better. Cas is infinitely fascinated by stores like these, and Dean\u2019s not far behind in that department, despite knowing all the As Seen on TV gadgets are more of a scam than anything. Unfortunately, Cas had to learn that the hard way a couple months ago when he was pressured by late night tv into ordering a slap chop. Long story short, he almost ended up slap chopping a fingertip off that Dean then had to sew back on with a needle and thread. Cas\u2019 finger healed fully, but the slap chop didn\u2019t fare nearly as well when Dean chucked it into the garbage.\nCas does love his snuggie though, because Dean\u2019s life is a joke. (He managed to talk him out of the leopard print one, at least.)\nAs they walk through the store, things between them settle, and soon enough they\u2019re back to their normal, bickering selves.\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you, Dean, we should get the light blue.\u201d\n\u201cNo, Cas, we should get the dark brown.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know brown sheets will match?\u201d\n\u201cJesus, Cas, it\u2019s brown. It\u2019s a neutral, it goes with everything.\u201d\n\u201cWell I think the blue would look nicer.\u201d\nDean slouches against the wall of sheets covered in plastic. \u201cOh my god. Okay, look, interior decorating tip number one, always get dark sheets if you have the option.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t realize you were an interior decorator on the side. You should have told me.\u201d\n\u201cDark sheets don\u2019t show stains, Cas. You so much as drool wrong on light sheets and you\u2019re fucked.\u201d\nCas narrows his eyes, as if trying to suss Dean out. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about drool,\u201d he parses, \u201cYou want to eat in bed, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026 No.\u201d\n\u201cDean Winchester, so help me if the only reason you want dark sheets is so you can eat in our bed-\u201d\n\u201cOkay, maybe that\u2019s a part of it, but-\u201d\n\u201c-We\u2019re getting the blue-\u201d\n\u201c-What I said about stains still stands, and we all know how you are about drool-\u201d\nCas hits him with the plastic bag of sheets. Not hard or anything, but enough that Dean\u2019s eyebrows rise.\n\u201cOkay, one, I\u2019m not getting into another pillow fight with you. I admit I learned my lesson last time. And two, I\u2019m not getting into a pillow fight with you in Bed Bath and Beyond. Jesus.\u201d\nCas taps him this time, lighter.\n\u201cSo I win, then,\u201d he says, clutching his precious blue sheets a little tighter.\nWhat happens next Dean is firmly against calling a pillow fight. More like a brief sheet scuffle.\nAs it stands, they end up buying both pairs of sheets.\n***\nThey meet Sam back at the motel, and when he offers them some of his leftover pizza, his eyebrows draw together in legitimate concern when Dean declines.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d he asks immediately. He looks to Cas. \u201cHave you let him out of your site today?\u201d he stands up. \u201cI\u2019m getting the holy water and silver.\u201d\nDean rolls his eyes and holds out a hand. \u201cWould you calm your tall ass down please? We\u2019re going to the grocery store after this and I\u2019m going to make some real food back at the apartment.\u201d\nSam sits down, a shit-eating grin spreading across his face.\n\u201cOh, of course,\u201d he says, folding his hands together. \u201cTo celebrate.\u201d\nDean reaches over to pick up a limp piece of pizza, frowning at it.\n\u201cTo save ourselves from eating cardboard,\u201d he corrects. \u201cI could cook better pizza than this in like ten minutes.\u201d\n\u201cWine?\u201d Sam asks, holding up a fake bottle in one hand, \u201cOr champagne?\u201d he holds up the other.\n\u201cHow about the chardonn-knock you the fuck out?\u201d Dean asks. \u201cI hear it\u2019s free and very crisp.\u201d\nSam grabs a cold piece of pizza and chomps into it, obviously very pleased with himself. Dean turns around to plead at Cas.\n\u201cYou just gonna stand there? You\u2019re my fake boyfriend. Defend my honor.\u201d\nCas doesn\u2019t even look up from his phone. \u201cNo,\u201d he says in a very bored voice.\n\u201cWow. Rude.\u201d\n\u201cAre we going to discuss the case or not?\u201d Cas asks, slipping his phone into his pocket. \u201cI\u2019m very hungry and want to leave.\u201d\n\u201cSheesh Cas, tell us how you really feel. You\u2019ll be lucky if I cook you ramen with an attitude like that.\u201d\nCas sits in the chair waiting at the desk and stares at Dean balefully, almost petulantly.\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d Dean says, this time turning to Sam for help. Sam just shrugs.\n\u201cYour fake lovers\u2019 quarrel, not mine,\u201d he says. He squares his laptop in front of him. \u201cAre we gonna do the debriefing thing or not?\u201d Before either Dean or Cas can answer, he grimaces at the notepad beside him and says, \u201cNot like it\u2019s gonna take long.\u201d\n\u201cThat means it\u2019s either good news or bad news but judging from our entire life I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s bad,\u201d Dean says.\nSam nods. \u201cYep.\u201d I spent all afternoon talking to people all around town.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, and got nothing?\u201d Dean asks.\nSam huffs. \u201cExactly the opposite, actually. Too much. I\u2019ve got pages of stories and anecdotes and he-said-she-said going back literally hundreds of years. Seems like this is the kind of town where everyone had a great great grandfather who had some kind of ghost story that had been passed down through their family for generations, blah blah.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, join the club,\u201d Dean says. \u201cWhat about our building specifically?\u201d\nSam shrugs, flipping through his notebook. \u201cSame,\u201d he says. \u201cTons of stuff.\u201d\n\u201cSo now it\u2019s just a matter of sorting fact from fiction,\u201d Cas finally chimes in, and Dean turns to him with a raised eyebrow.\n\u201cI\u2019m headed to the library tomorrow morning,\u201d Sam says. \u201cYou guys coming?\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t we already agree that the new guys in town hanging out with the FBI agent who also just got into town look weird?\u201d\n\u201cUh, not that I recall,\u201d Sam says. \u201cSounds like you\u2019re just trying to get out of doing research.\u201d\nDean waves a hand vaguely. \u201cPssssshaw,\u201d he scoffs. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like me at all.\u201d Truthfully, there are some things at the apartment Dean wants to get in order. Figuring out what goes in which cupboards, what color towels to get for the bathroom, deciding if they want to move the furniture around or not\u2026 Y\u2019know. Stuff that\u2019s completely necessary for the case they\u2019re working.\n\u201cUh huh,\u201d Sam says, sounding thoroughly unimpressed.\n\u201cAnd the history of the place?\u201d Cas asks. \u201cDid you find out anything pertinent?\u201d\n\u201cNope,\u201d Sam says. \u201cAside from all the bizarre deaths, this place is pretty boring, history-wise. I\u2019ll dig into it more tomorrow at the library, but I can\u2019t guarantee I\u2019ll find anything.\u201d\nDean glances at his watch.\n\u201cAlright, well, we better go then,\u201d he says, standing up and grabbing his jacket, glancing at Cas. \u201cYou good?\u201d\nCas nods, and as they head toward the door, Sam says, \u201cYou got dinner reservations or something?\u201d\n\u201cI already told you we\u2019re eating in tonight,\u201d Dean says over his shoulder. \u201cNah, Sammy, tonight we\u2019re meeting the neighbors.\u201d\n***\nThey\u2019re in the baking aisle of the grocery store when Dean glances around to make sure they\u2019re alone and says, \u201cSo, like, we haven\u2019t actually talked about\u2026 how we\u2019re supposed to act. As a couple.\u201d\nCas peers at a jar of maraschino cherries where they sit on a shelf like they hold the secrets of the universe. \u201cWe seem to be doing just fine so far.\u201d\nFine is an interesting word to describe their situation, given that Dean\u2019s palms have been sweating at an alarming rate all day.\n\u201cHelen seemed to believe us,\u201d Cas says, half his attention still on the merchandise.\n\u201cYeah, well, we\u2019re paying Helen, and Helen is desperate to sell that place,\u201d Dean says. \u201cShe might be willing to overlook how twitchy her two newest tenants are.\u201d\n\u201cSo?\u201d Cas asks. \u201cAs long as Helen buys it, why does it matter what anyone else thinks?\u201d\nDean half rolls his eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s the whole point of cover in the first place,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re lying low, which means we want everyone to buy this. Us.\u201d He gestures between them.\nCas puts the sprinkles he was just examining back on the shelf and finally turns to look at Dean, frustrated.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve noticed, but I\u2019m playing my part just fine,\u201d Cas says smoothly. He steps into Dean\u2019s space before Dean even has a chance to register the movement, pinching his lapel between two fingers and straightening his jacket. He pats Dean on the chest and steps away, blas\u00e9 as anything.\nDean\u2019s ears are ringing.\n\u201cWe still need bread and orange juice,\u201d Cas says, like nothing just happened, and starts walking down the aisle.\nDean blinks and snaps out of it, hurrying after Cas with hot cheeks.\n***\nThey eat dinner and then they talk to the neighbors. They hear what Dean assumes is just the same-but-slightly-different stories from the ones Sam heard earlier today. They talk to the slightly aloof middle aged couple across the hall, and the most they get from them is that the building has a reputation for cold spots, but the couple next to them more than makes up for that.\nSandy and Dave are exuberant almost to the point of nausea, and Dean does his best to smile along while Cas looks slightly perplexed at best. Over (too much) wine, Sandy tells them the story of the \u201chorrifying vision\u201d she had a couple years ago while Dave was off on a business trip to Ohio.\n\u201cSo there I was,\u201d she exclaims, face red and bob haircut bouncing with even the slightest movement, \u201cSealing up some chopped veggies for Cici Carter\u2019s Fourth of July Annual Summer Blowout Bonanza, and I-\u201d she falters here for a moment, searching for words, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I heard anything, exactly, but I felt it, I guess. It was like I was being watched. Spooky.\u201d She shivers, and Dave puts an arm around her. Stuck on the loveseat, Dean and Cas\u2019 knees knock together. \u201cI turned around and I swear on my mother\u2019s grave that I saw a man standing in my kitchen.\u201d She leans forward, \u201cA man covered in blood. But before I even had a chance to scream, he vanished!\u201d She snaps her fingers. \u201cJust like that.\u201d\nDean feels his eyes widen slightly. \u201cWhoa\u2026\u201d he says, playing along, and that\u2019s probably the alcohol talking. \u201cAnd you think\u2026 you really think it was a ghost?!\u201d\u00a0\nSandy nods solemnly. \u201cI never believed in all that paranormal nonsense until we moved in here,\u201d she says seriously. \u201cThings get lost, or moved around even though nobody touched them. Lights turn on and off when no one\u2019s in the room. Sometimes I swear I can hear footsteps walking down the hallway in the middle of the night even though we\u2019re both in bed.\u201d\nDean leans forward as well, using Cas\u2019 knee to brace himself. \u201cDo you have any idea what could be going on?\u201d he asks. \u201cI mean, d\u2019you think it could be someone who used to live in this building? Who died here, maybe?\u201d\nSandy takes another sip- gulp, more like- of wine. \u201cOooooh dear, I don\u2019t know,\u201d she says, shaking her head. \u201cThese things give me the heebie jeebies. I try not to think about them too much.\u201d\n\u201cHave you considered moving away?\u201d Cas asks. He\u2019s had less wine than Dean, but there\u2019s still a pink tinge to his cheeks, and his hair, in the span of a couple hours, has somehow become even messier than usual. His eyes are strangely intense.\n\u201cOh, of course,\u201d Sandy says. \u201cEveryone who lives here has considered it at some point or another. Some people have gone, of course, bless them. But the rent is just so gosh darn cheap. And, really, what\u2019s a couple lost house keys in the grand scheme of things?\u201d\nDean exchanges a glance with Cas, and then says quietly, \u201cDid you know the person who lived in our apartment before us?\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0\nAt that, both Sandy and Dave go very still. Dean clears his throat awkwardly. \u201cUh, sorry,\u201d he says roughly, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to pry or anything.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no hon that\u2019s not- it\u2019s fine,\u201d she assures him, reaching over and patting his knee. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know them very well. He was a younger man, I think. Kept to himself for the most part.\u201d She swallows, obviously uncomfortable.\n\u201cWe walked by the crime scene before we knew\u2026 just how messy it was,\u201d Dave finishes. \u201cThere was blood everywhere.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Dean says, and Sandy tries to smile at him.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, dear,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s just fine. Unfortunate accidents happen all the time.\u201d\nThrough the haze of alcohol, Dean thinks, shit, these poor bastards don\u2019t even realize. They haven\u2019t connected the murders to the other signs of ghost activity. He takes his hand off Cas\u2019 knee, leaning back into the couch and shoving a hand into his pocket, fumbling the protective hex bag there. Cas asks another question that Dean doesn\u2019t pay attention to, trying to hide his arm behind Cas as he works the hex bag in between the couch cushions. The last thing they need is any of their new neighbors dying and having police swarming all over the place, taking names and asking questions.\u00a0\nWhen they spoke (very briefly) to the couple across the hall earlier, he had managed to stick a protective bag into the bowl of plastic fruit on their counter, but he got such a strong we don\u2019t take kindly to your folk round here vibe from them that he almost took it back just on principle.\nIt\u2019s later than they realize when they head back to their own apartment, Sandy begging them to stop by and visit them again soon. As Cas fumbles with his key at the lock, Dean leans in close and whispers to him, \u201cLook at us, bein\u2019 all neighborly and shit.\u201d\nCas chuckles as the lock clicks and the door swings open. Dean practically stumbles in, throwing an arm around Cas to steady himself.\n\u201cRight,\u201d Cas confirms, \u201cWe should definitely go to bed.\u201d\n\u201cThe same bed,\u201d Dean says solemnly, then laughs.\nDean lazily shucks his shirt, sloppily fumbling at the button on his jeans while Cas does the same on the other side of the bed. He digs around in his duffel for a pair of sweat pants, yanking them on and collapsing into bed (freshly adorned with their light blue sheets). Cas doesn\u2019t even bother putting on pants, instead opting to sleep in just boxers, and Dean takes a hazy to moment to think, not fair. \n\u201cWell, happy one day anniversary,\u201d Dean says once they\u2019ve got the lights turned out and they\u2019re both comfortably under the sheets. The doorway and window sills are lined with salt, and in the morning they have to paint sigils on the walls. \u201cHere\u2019s to many more.\u201d\nIt feels strange but good to know that they\u2019re sleeping on sheets they cared enough about to fight over.\n***\nThe next morning, they paint the sigils on the wall of their bedroom. The paint they\u2019re using is similar to the already cr\u00e8me walls, since anything brighter would look strange when they paint over again after the hunt is finished. It\u2019s likely they over-sigil instead of under-sigil, but Dean figures if they have the time, they may as well. Better now than whenever they find this thing and potentially get caught with their pants down. As the years go by, Dean, Sam, and now Cas all have to minimize the amount of times they can get thrown into walls by ghoulies before something snaps that can\u2019t be fixed by dental floss and cheap whiskey. (Not that he particularly liked getting thrown into walls when he was 20, but he sure as hell came to like it a lot less the older he got.)\nThey paint in silence, mostly to concentrate on the sigils they\u2019re trying to ink correctly. Cas only threw on a t-shirt after rolling out of bed, and he looks more like a stray mutt that got loose in an art studio than an actual human being as he frowns at his phone screen where he keeps pictures of all the sigils he hasn\u2019t memorized yet. He has a streak of paint on his cheek that Dean\u2019s not entirely sure he\u2019s noticed yet, and he silently wonders how long it\u2019ll take Cas to realize.\nHe focuses back on his own sigil, a jagged one that\u2019s supposed to ward off mermaids or something, (yeah, okay, but Dean\u2019s not taking any chances) and when he raises his brush back to the wall he finds that he also didn\u2019t escape this art project unscathed. Just under the crook of his right elbow is a strip of paint that he doesn\u2019t remember noticing, and he feels himself swallow as he stares at the vague 7-shape it makes on his arm.\n\u201cDean?\u201d Cas asks, obviously having noticed him go stock-still. When he doesn\u2019t reply, Cas puts his brush down and tosses his phone onto the bed as he steps over into Dean\u2019s space. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asks, but as soon as he follows Dean\u2019s gaze to the paint splotch on his arm, his mouth thins in understanding.\n\u201cDean-\u201d he starts, but Dean brushes him off, turning slightly away from him.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he mumbles, \u201cI\u2019m just being stupid.\u201d\nIt\u2019s been over a year since they\u2019ve gotten rid of the Mark, but Dean still swears he can feel it burning under his skin, sometimes. Anytime he gets angry- like, well and truly and genuinely angry- there\u2019s always a part of him waiting for some kind of spark to catch, and it\u2019s the Mark that he wants to strike that match against. He doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s ever going to go away completely, now just as much a part of him as the scar tissue in his fingers from that salt\u2019n\u2019burn way back in \u201898 or the way the freckles on his face darken in the summer. Some days he looks down at his arm and still expects to see it there, just as red and charred and mean as the first time he ever saw it.\nIt\u2019s long gone, but not really. Dean still carries the shit he did under its influence, the fights with Sam and the punches he threw at Cas, the innocent people he hurt and the lives he ruined. He\u2019s tried to keep on trucking, working through the stuff he can, trying to live under the weight of the stuff he can\u2019t. Things are probably about as back to normal as they\u2019re ever gonna get, but he still catches flashes of black in the mirror sometimes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Cas says softly, reaching out. He curls a careful palm around Dean\u2019s elbow, sliding his hand down to cover the paint splotch.\nDean tries to take his arm back, but Cas has always had a firm grip.\u00a0\n\u201cNot really,\u201d Dean says, harsher than he means to. \u201cI just got tripped up by a paint stroke.\u201d\nCas slides his palm down the rest of Dean\u2019s forearm, the paint streak gone. Dean tries not to roll his eyes. Cas can still do what most people would refer to as parlor tricks, just little tiny things like managing to get that last, impossible squeeze out of the tube of toothpaste or knowing just the right moment to stop the microwave so that the leftovers are perfectly heated up. Similar to the not-superman-but-still-pretty-damn-strong theory, they\u2019re not sure if it\u2019s holdover from Cas\u2019 grace, or if human Cas is just naturally a little more in tune with the world around him.\nApparently, this specific brand of parlor tricks is also helpful in removing the paint color egg shell from arms, and Dean feels like an idiot for getting caught up in the first place.\n\u201cIt\u2019ll take time,\u201d Cas says quietly. \u201cJust give it time.\u201d He keeps his hand on Dean\u2019s arm for a moment longer, before allowing it to fall away and stepping back, eyes still trained on his face.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Dean says gruffly. \u201cI know.\u201d He\u2019s miles ahead from where he was at this time last year, at least. When he was having nightmares every time he closed his eyes and would wake up sobbing in the pervading darkness of his room.\n\u201cYou\u2019re here now,\u201d Cas says, gently but firmly. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not letting you go, ever again.\u201d The words aren\u2019t funny, but the fact that Cas is saying them with three day old stubble and hair that looks like a bird\u2019s nest is. His t-shirt is too big for him and the boxers are just the cherry on top of this whole dumb cake. Dean actually lets out something that wants to be a giggle. Maybe it\u2019s the paint fumes messing with his head.\n\u201cAre you- laughing?\u201d Cas asks, obviously confused. Potentially even offended that Dean is terrible at receiving his particular brand of declarations.\nDean clears his throat.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he says, bending down to pick up his brush again. It\u2019s really not that funny, but it kind of is. Him and Cas discussing the darkness that\u2019s plagued their lives for as long as they\u2019ve lived, as they paint the walls of their shared bedroom in the apartment they apparently now live in.\nIn their pajamas.\n\u201cOur lives are fucked, dude,\u201d he says, chuckling. \u201cI mean, this is the most normal we\u2019ve ever been probably, and that\u2019s what\u2019s so fucked about it.\u201d\n\u201cWe are still hunting something,\u201d Cas says slowly, \u201cAnd we did just stick protective hex bags in all our neighbor\u2019s apartments last night.\u201d\nDean snorts laughter.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I mean,\u201d he says. \u201cLike, this is as close to normal as we\u2019re ever gonna get. You with the magic tricks. Me with the Mark bullshit.\u201d He gestures at the sigils drying on the wall beside them. \u201cAll that nasty business.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cI think I\u2019m having an epiphany.\u201d\nCas looks at him, brows raised.\n\u201cWas that the epiphany?\u201d he asks, a little baffled, \u201cThat we\u2019re never going to be normal people? I thought that was something we\u2019d established a species-change and a half ago.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? No,\u201d Dean says, waving him off. \u201cThe epiphany part was that this is a good thing. This- this weird, strange, half-domestic-half-hunting thing. Like.\u201d Dean grins, gesturing around them. \u201cLook at us. Standing in a home that doesn\u2019t also double as the secret clubhouse of a secret society of dudes doing secret things.\u201d\n\u201cYou love that it\u2019s a secret clubhouse of a secret society of dudes doing secret things, though,\u201d Cas says.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Dean says. \u201cAnd that will always be very, very cool.\u201d He holds up his paint roller. \u201cBut this will also always be very cool.\u201d\nFondness creeps into Cas\u2019 eyes as he cocks his head slightly and looks Dean up and down.\n\u201cYes,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it will be. Very cool, that is.\u201d\nDean thought he learned his lesson with the pillows, and then he thought he learned his lesson with the sheets. But now he tests the waters again because he\u2019s feeling buoyant for reasons he can\u2019t exactly explain but he\u2019s sure are related to the epiphany he just had, and reaches forward to wipe a long streak of eggshell down the front of Cas\u2019 shirt with his roller.\nCas doesn\u2019t move, but stares at Dean with wide eyes. Dean stares right back.\n\u201cWhy\u2019d you do that?\u201d he asks.\nDean steps forward, the newspaper they\u2019d laid crackling under his feet. He holds his roller out in front of him.\n\u201cBecause I can?\u201d\nCas takes a step away.\n\u201cDean,\u201d he says measuredly, and Dean knows he\u2019s only trying to sound like the voice of reason because he doesn\u2019t currently have a weapon/paintbrush with which to fight back.\n\u201cCas,\u201d he says back in the same tone of voice, advancing slowly with the roller.\n\u201cDean,\u201d Cas says again, more urgently this time. His foot bumps against the paint tray where he dropped his brush earlier, and holds both hands in the air as he bends down to pick it up. It\u2019s way less threatening than the paint roller, and Dean smirks.\n\u201cC\u2019mon, babe,\u201d he says jokingly, gesturing with the roller, \u201cGet over here and lay one on me.\u201d\nCas holds the paintbrush out, giving it a couple half-hearted waves.\nDean feels his smirk slip into something more predatory as he advances. Cas must see the glint in his eye, because he blinks, and then in the next second he\u2019s tearing out of the room and the chase is on.\nDean follows, practically falling flat on his face as he slips in the salt laid across the doorway. He slides into the wall opposite, using the momentum he has to push himself off and charge down the hallway. Cas is standing on the opposite side of the couch, looking awfully naked in his boxers and now dirty shirt.\n\u201cThis is not a productive use of our time, Dean,\u201d he warns.\n\u201cYou only say that because you got the short end of the stick,\u201d Dean says, nodding to the paintbrush he\u2019s holding. \u201cLiterally.\u201d\n\u201cDean,\u201d Cas repeats, and Dean tries not to think about how often Cas says his name, how much he likes Cas saying his name.\nCas gives himself away though, his mouth turning up just barely at the corners. Cas always likes to think he\u2019s some stoic badass, but Dean\u2019s known him for long enough that he can read him like a book. The smallest curl of Cas\u2019 lips is just as obvious to Dean now as raucous laughter from someone else.\n\u201cYou think you can take me?\u201d Dean asks, raising an eyebrow. A weird tension has erupted between them, despite being almost across the room from each other. It feels like a challenge.\nCas lets his expression slide into a lazy smirk. \u201cI\u2019m two for two already,\u201d he says, twirling the brush expertly between his fingers. \u201cI\u2019m happy to make it three for three.\u201d\nDean beckons Cas forward with a curl of his finger, \u201cWell then, time to shine, clementine. Show me what you got.\u201d\nCas flicks paint at him.\nFrom across the room.\nAnd grins.\nDean feels a spot of white land on his cheek.\n\u201cYou little shit,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s cheating.\u201d\n\u201cYou only say that because you got the inefficient end of the stick,\u201d Cas says, dry as a bone, and flicks more paint at him.\n\u201cHey, HEY!\u201d Dean yells, holding his hands in front of his face. \u201cThat shit could be toxic! How would you feel if I swallowed some and died all because you were too chickenshit to face me head on?\u201d\n\u201cI would be very sad, Dean,\u201d Cas says somberly, \u201cThen I would find a way to break into heaven and kick your ass for being stupid enough to swallow toxic paint,\u201d he continues, much less somberly. He flicks some more paint. \u201cI was a strategist in heaven, if you\u2019ll recall. I\u2019m strategizing.\u201d\n\u201cWhile there\u2019s nothing I love more than watching my boyfriend utilize his celestial skillset to flick paint at me while hiding behind the couch, I think I\u2019m just gonna take matters into my own hands,\u201d Dean decides, advancing again.\n\u201cNo, Dean,\u201d Cas says. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cOr what, you\u2019ll throw your brush at me?\u201d\nHe sprints forward, prepared to paint role Cas into next week if he has to. He vaults over the couch and Cas makes a break for it, and Cas is pretty quick but Dean, perhaps for the first time ever, is quicker. He manages to paint a wide, if somewhat messy stripe all the way from Cas\u2019 ass to his shoulders, and when Cas turns around, resigned expression and all, Dean doesn\u2019t shy away from Cabbage Patching over to him, grinning right up close.\n\u201cWhat was that about three for three?\u201d he asks, cupping his ear and leaning in.\n\u201cYou\u2019re insufferable,\u201d Cas says, half-annoyed and half-fond, his breath warm against Dean\u2019s cheek. Dean feels his eyelids flutter.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m a winner,\u201d Dean corrects, pulling away and trying to regain his bearings. \u201cBut that does sound like something a sore loser would say.\u201d \u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not sore,\u201d Cas says sorely. \u201cAnd I\u2019m also not a loser. I\u2019ve won the last two.\u201d\nDean blanches. \u201cWhat, the pillow fight and the sheet thing? That doesn\u2019t count. We never agreed that that counted.\u201d\nCas looks at Dean, assessing.\n\u201cThat sounds like something a sore loser would say,\u201d he says lightly.\nDean oscillates between tackling Cas and yanking him in by his paint covered t-shirt to probably do something to Cas\u2019 mouth with his mouth. Instead, he settles on leaning forward and pointing a finger in Cas\u2019 face, because Cas hates being pointed at. He finds it condescending, or something.\n\u201cFine,\u201d Dean says, \u201cI\u2019ll give you this one-\u201d\n\u201cTwo.\u201d\nDean grits his teeth. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll give you these two. But I\u2019m gonna even the score eventually.\u201d\nCas leans forward as well, wrapping a hand slowly and deliberately around Dean\u2019s pointed finger.\n\u201cI look forward to it,\u201d he says, literally pumping his fist once on Dean\u2019s finger before pulling off with what Dean would almost describe (with very sweaty palms and very tight pants) as a leer. His brain makes the same sound as a car engine does when something is very wrong with it, and his throat goes dry.\nWithout another word, Cas turns around and starts walking back toward their room, while Dean stands there like King Midas just grabbed his ass and turned him into gold.\nOnce Cas disappears down the hallway he calls back, \u201cI\u2019m not finishing these sigils on my own, by the way.\u201d\nHe snaps out of paralysis, and heads towards the bedroom.\n\u201cJust so you know, your ass looks like a two lane road,\u201d he says belligerently, loud enough for Cas to hear.\n\u201cHow nice of you to notice,\u201d Cas says mildly as Dean walks into the room. Luckily, he doesn\u2019t bother dropping any of the dozen \u201cdrive me\u201d or \u201cride me\u201d puns that were most definitely at his disposal.\nThey finish painting the rest of the sigils, and when they step back to admire their work Dean nods in satisfaction.\n\u201cLook at us go,\u201d he says. And Dean looks at Cas, standing beside him, always smiling more with his eyes than his mouth, and thinks, I\u2019m not letting you go, either.\n***\nTwenty minutes later there\u2019s a knock on the door, and long term habit has Dean shoving his gun into the back of his waistband and keeping a hand at the ready just in case. Cas hovers warily just behind him, still in his goddam boxers.\n\u201cReally?\u201d Dean hisses at him, before rolling his eyes and opening the door to reveal Sandy from down the hall, jacket in her hand looking strangely like the one Dean swore he wore back to the apartment last night.\nWhen she gets a proper look at both of them, her eyes widen almost comically.\n\u201cUm,\u201d she says, and Dean\u2019s suddenly self-conscious of all the paint Cas fucking flicked at him earlier. \u201cIf this is a bad time\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat, no of course not.\u201d\nAnd then Dean actually realizes what she means, and wonders how quickly his face can turn red. Him and Cas, a couple who just moved into a new apartment, at least one of them in a state of semi-undress (Dean glares at the boxers again), while they\u2019re both covered in dried white stuff. He shoots a glance at Cas, and that probably doesn\u2019t make them look any more innocent. Cas, as usual, looks like someone forgot to iron him this morning, hair sticking up in all kinds of weird places.\n\u201cOh!\u201d Dean says, forcing a laugh, \u201cNo, god, um,\u201d he gestures to Cas, \u201cWe were painting, I, uh. I swear. Eggshell, it\u2019s called. Y\u2019know, cause, um, white.\u201d He points to the mess on Cas\u2019 torso and knows he\u2019s cringing. His face must be the color of a firetruck. \u201cJust covering up some chips in the paint.\u201d He smiles weakly.\nSandy clears her throat, working up a way more convincing smile than Dean\u2019s.\n\u201cNo worries!\u201d she says, holding out Dean\u2019s coat. \u201cI think the wine left this behind last night.\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d Dean takes it. \u201cThanks a lot for bringing it by.\u201d\nSandy\u2019s expression turns sheepish. \u201cI have to admit,\u201d she says, \u201cI did have another reason for stopping by.\n\u201cDid you?\u201d Dean asks, probably not hiding his lack of enthusiasm very well. It\u2019s all in the teeth. He keeps them too closely gritted sometimes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just that, I know today is only your second day, but there\u2019s an old dance hall in town and they put on a get together every month for what I guess you\u2019d call our neighborhood watch,\u201d she explains, \u201cIt\u2019s definitely something of a tradition in town, but it\u2019ll also allow you boys to get to know everyone.\u201d She leans in like she\u2019s about to tell them a secret, \u201cNot much goes on around here, as I\u2019m sure you already know. Gives us a good chance to get gussied up.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026 Oh.\u201d Dean says. \u201cSo it\u2019s\u2026 a formal thing?\u201d\nSandy shrugs. \u201cThere\u2019s refreshments. There\u2019s dancing. You certainly don\u2019t have to show up in a tux. Though I will say Dave usually wears a tie. It starts at 7 tonight, five a person at the door.\u201d\nOh, shit, Dean doesn\u2019t want to deal with this. But there\u2019s no way he can just pass up a lead like this when it practically falls into their paint-covered laps.\u00a0 He shoots a look at Cas, who simply shrugs one shoulder in return.\n\u201cWhy not,\u201d Dean says. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be a blast.\u201d\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s wonderful!\u201d Sandy says, and her genuine delight does actually ease Dean\u2019s reluctance slightly. She leans in again, her tone turning almost cheeky. \u201cAnd may I just say, that you two make such a handsome pair,\u201d she says. \u201cThe town is already a titter and everyone is very excited to meet you.\u201d\n\u201cSounds like fun,\u201d Dean says, then pretends to check his watch before he realizes he hasn\u2019t put his watch on today. \u201cWe\u2019ll see you and everyone tonight then.\u201d\n\u201cBye bye!\u201d she says, heading off back down the hall.\nDean closes the door.\n\u201cShit,\u201d he sighs.\n\u201cThis could be a lead, Dean,\u201d Cas says. \u201cSurely Sandy and Dave invited us in case we\u2019d like to talk to anyone about the hauntings.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I know that,\u201d Dean says. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m worried about.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, so what are you worried about?\u201d Cas asks.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n***\nFancy shit.\nAnd even though he loves those tiny little cocktail weenies, he has horrible luck with dropping them and staining nice clothes, and getting stains out of nice clothes in laundromats was always a bitch and a half.\u00a0 At least now they have the bunker (and their apartment, Dean has to keep reminding himself), any weenie related mishaps can be fixed relatively quickly, and Dean\u2019s even carrying a stain remover stick in his pocket like an almost responsible adult. But he still feels weird at these things, uncomfortable in his own skin. This upper-middle class town pto stuff was never his life and he\u2019ll never quite fit in. He\u2019s not bad enough to blow their cover or anything, but most times when him and Sam had to show up to things like this, it was like people could smell on them that they weren\u2019t quite up to snuff.\nCas, though. Cas is from a different world, and sometimes Dean forgets that, especially now that he\u2019s- for the most part- just like any other human. Cas knows how to walk and how to talk, all that soldier shit heaven crammed into him however many million years ago when they put him together still clunking around somewhere in there. Dean was raised a solider as well, but not one who walked with his back straight.\nThey did their best with the clothes, but like the interview shit the other day they were kind of flying by the seat of their pants. Cas ends up wearing a black vest over a striped navy and white dress shirt, a black tie nearly knotted at his neck. (They\u2019re long past the point of Dean needing to tie Cas\u2019 ties for him, but tonight Cas had grumbled with the fabric until Dean finally got tired of hearing it and reached around Cas\u2019 neck to tie it himself.) He\u2019s wearing the same black jeans from the interview and his black FBI shoes. Dean attempted not to drool over Cas quite so much this time, but vests seem to like Cas\u2019 broad frame, and Cas seems to like rolling up his sleeves, so Dean works with what he\u2019s got.\nDean, on the other hand, isn\u2019t sure if he\u2019s once again drawn the short end of the stick or not. He\u2019s in plaid, which he likes, but he\u2019s also wearing suspenders and a bow tie, which he doesn\u2019t like near as much. But it had been the fastest outfit he could throw together in the store (since they found themselves running late because Dean had to yell at Cas about putting a comb through his hair), and it was the fasted \u201cnice\u201d outfit he could grab. The lighter blue in the plaid goes nicely (he thinks) with the navy of the suspenders and pants and bow tie. He didn\u2019t actually think about how he and Cas kind of matched until after they had parked, and then he groaned because he sighed up to date Cas, not take him to prom.\nWhen Cas asks what he\u2019s grumbling about, Dean explains the wardrobe malfunction and Cas looks desperately like he\u2019s trying to keep a straight face.\n\u201cWould you like me to go home and change?\u201d he asks, quirking a brow. \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019re going to be the talk of the town because we both wore shades of blue tonight.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a dick.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one who doesn\u2019t want to take me to prom. Me. Your boyfriend. To prom.\u201d\n\u201cCas, you didn\u2019t even go to high school.\u201d\n\u201cThey say it\u2019s supposed to be the best years of your life.\u201d\n\u201cThey lied.\u201d\n\u201cWho is \u2018they\u2019, anyway?\u201d Cas muses as they head toward the building. Dean can hear the music drifting through the walls. \u201cAnd why does their opinion matter so much more than everyone else\u2019s?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe you can write a paper on it for sixth period English,\u201d Dean says.\n\u201cPerhaps I will,\u201d Cas says. \u201cThough I\u2019d argue this type of paper is best suited for philosophy.\u201d\nDean shakes his head. \u201cAlways such a stickler.\u201d\nOnce they get to the door Dean expects someone to be waiting to take their entrance fee, or at least someone to bustle outside with a moneybox, but there\u2019s simply a lone can sitting on a table with a sign that reads: HIGHBURY NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH MONTHLY ROUND-UP: $5.\n\u201cAre these people idiots or just na\u00efve?\u201d Dean wonders out loud as he stuffs a couple fives into the can.\n\u201cMaybe they\u2019re more afraid of the kind of people who can\u2019t steal their money,\u201d Cas says knowingly.\nDean turns to look at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d Then, he realizes, \u201cOh, ghosts, yeah.\u201d They\u2019ve pretty much decided by now they\u2019re dealing with a ghost (or ghosts), mostly because it helps them narrow the suspect pool.\n\u201cThis town is actually quite peaceful,\u201d Cas says, \u201cBarring the occasional supernatural homicide, of course.\u201d\nThey head inside, and Dean immediately feels weird. This isn\u2019t the higher end shindig he thought it was gonna be, but it still makes his palms sweat regardless. Him and Sam cornered a couple vamps in an abandoned dance hall in Texas years ago, but Dean\u2019s never been inside one that\u2019s still in use. It looks almost like a barn minus the hayloft with its vaulted ceiling and wooden floors. There\u2019s old jazz playing from speakers in the corners, and about half the people here are swishing around on the dance floor.\n\u201cWhat year is it?\u201d Dean says to no one in particular. Some of the women here are actually wearing poodle skirts. There\u2019s a couple dudes smoking pipes over in the corner.\nDean and Cas walk over to the side of the room that isn\u2019t currently being used as a dance floor, taking two seats at an empty table.\n\u201cThis is fuckin\u2019 weird,\u201d Dean says, no preamble.\nCas, watching the people dancing, says, \u201cSandy did say there wasn\u2019t much to do around here.\u201d\n\u201cI thought she just meant people play a lot of videogames instead,\u201d Dean says, \u201cI feel like everything should be in black and white.\u201d\nAs if her ears were burning, Sandy and Dave emerge from the crowd, taking the empty seats beside them.\n\u201cWelcome!\u201d Sandy grins, at least wearing modern day clothing. \u201cI\u2019m so happy you two made it.\u201d\n\u201cHappy to be here,\u201d Dean lies.\nThey make small talk for a while, and their table slowly fills up. Sandy and Dave keep calling out to people walking by, introducing them to Dean and Cas. Some sit down to talk, and both Dean and Cas spend the next half hour or so having the same conversations over and over again. Every time he introduces Cas as his boyfriend, his cheeks heat, but he eventually gets better at it. All he can say is that he\u2019s glad as hell this case is in a blue state, and even then he\u2019s seen some not-so-friendly glances from a couple people that have steered clear of their table. Obviously word is getting around.\nEventually, they seem to have settled what Dean assumes is the \u201ccore\u201d group of the neighborhood watch in all available seats. Dean\u2019s actually not one hundred percent sure what neighborhood watches do other than having meetings, even though he was in one back when he lived with Lisa and Ben. Put up signs, maybe? Either way, he kind of expects everyone to say, \u201cthe greater good\u201d in sync at least once, and is disappointed when they don\u2019t. At one point he leans over to Cas and mumbles, \u201cWe\u2019re in fucking Sandford, Sergeant Angel.\u201d Cas shoots him a quick grin before being pulled into conversation again, and Dean turns back around to listen to a story he hasn\u2019t been paying attention to at all.\nA couple minutes later, a guy whose name Dean can\u2019t remember asks from across the table if they\u2019ve met the \u201cGhost of Painter Building\u201d yet, and every conversation around them grinds to an abrupt halt as Sandy glares at him, like he stole her thunder or something. Dean thinks she introduced the guy as her brother, which would explain why he seems to know where he and Cas live. Everyone is suddenly staring at him and Cas, and one woman says, \u201cYou live in the Painter building?\u201d\n\u201cSure do,\u201d Dean says, somewhat awkwardly.\n\u201cSeen anything strange yet?\u201d Someone else asks.\n\u201cNot really,\u201d Cas says.\nEveryone kind of looks at each other, and Dean senses some tension at the table. Out on the dance floor, couples continue to twirl, unaware. He assumes the Painter building has long been a source of debate, especially since a neighborhood watch is technically supposed to help people, and the people in this neighborhood keep dying \u201caccidentally\u201d.\nFinally, a blond woman a couple seats down from Dean sighs and says, \u201cWe need to do something about that place.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be done,\u201d a guy says from across the table. \u201cWe\u2019ve been over this a million times, Janet.\u201d\nJanet\u2019s eyes flash. \u201cThere\u2019s something going on in that building,\u201d she says, shooting an almost apologetic look first at Sandy and Dave, then Dean and Cas. \u201cThere must be someone we can call or s-\u201d\n\u201cWho you gonna call? Really?\u201d the guy asks in disbelief. \u201cWhat, professional ghost hunters?\u201d He snorts.\nDean and Cas exchange a look.\nThis all sounds like ground that has been tread before, and Dean doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s hilarious or sad that these people (most of them, anyway) still have no idea what\u2019s going on, or will even admit that what\u2019s right in front of their eyes is real.\nDean likes this Janet lady, though. She might have something to say. While he waits for the fight to blow over, Dean shoots off a text to Sam with updates. Sam had practically snorted coffee out his nose when Dean told him this morning where they were gonna be tonight, but even he had to admit that it could lead to some good info. Dean ends his text with a suck on that, and hits send with a smirk.\nOnce the hubbub has died down and tempers have simmered and the table has moved onto other topics, Dean taps Cas on the shoulder, letting him know he\u2019s going to be back in a minute. He takes the seat next to Janet that\u2019s just been vacated, holding out a hand.\n\u201cHey,\u201d he says, \u201cWe got introduced from across the table earlier. I\u2019m Leo.\u201d\nJanet takes his hand and re-introduces herself.\n\u201cI hope I didn\u2019t freak you out with that Painter talk,\u201d she apologizes. \u201cI\u2019m just\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Paranoid, I guess.\u201d\n\u201cI gotta say, I\u2019m more interested in that place than freaked out,\u201d Dean says. \u201cHave you ever seen anything yourself?\u201d\nShe hesitates.\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe me.\u201d\nOh man, if Dean had a nickel.\n\u201cTry me,\u201d he says.\nShe sighs. \u201cI lived there. For six months. After that I couldn\u2019t take it anymore, and moved somewhere more expensive across town.\u201d\n\u201cAnd by \u2018it\u2019 you mean\u2026 ghosts?\u201d Dean prompts.\nShe half-laughs, probably more out of discomfort than anything. \u201cIt sounds so dumb,\u201d she says self-consciously. \u201cEven just saying the word out loud. Shit.\u201d\nDean shakes his head. \u201cNah,\u201d he says. \u201cHey, some of the shit me and Steve have seen?\u201d he jerks his thumb over his shoulder at Cas. \u201cNothing compared to that, I promise.\u201d\nShe swallows, tucking a stray strand of hair behind her ear.\n\u201cEvery town has some sort of haunted spot,\u201d she says. \u201cSomething the locals always tell stories about. The house on the hill the kids are always warned against going near. The witch who lives at the end of the road. Whatever. It\u2019s all fake, all weird. Like a creepy reverse Santa Clause or tooth fairy.\u201d She glances ruefully at Dean. \u201cThe Painter Building is haunted. Not cutesy haunted like Casper or kitschy haunted like bad pipes that gurgle in the night, but seriously pissed off haunted. Helen even changed it so that no one person could rent anymore. That\u2019s why she wanted couples only, so they could at least keep an eye on each other.\u201d\n\u201cCold spots?\u201d Dean asks. \u201cShit moving around on its own?\u201d\n\u201cFreezing room,\u201d Janet corrects, \u201cand shit getting thrown around like it just got caught in a tornado.\u201d\nOkay. Probably not a poltergeist. Probably not the ghost of anyone deceased in the last couple decades. It takes a long time for a spirit to build up that kind of thunder.\n\u201cI almost died probably three or four separate times?\u201d she guesses. \u201cMy ceiling fan detached and crashed about a foot away from me. A steak knife flew across the kitchen, close enough that it sheared off a chunk of hair. Some invisible force almost pushed me off my balcony.\u201d She nods in affirmation. \u201cAny of those events separately I could maybe explain away. But that\u2019s only the tip of the iceberg. I\u2019ve seen shadowy figures standing behind me in mirrors, and when I turn around they\u2019re gone. I\u2019ve seen them in my kitchen. In my bed, once.\u201d She shudders. \u201cI slept at a friend\u2019s house for a week after that.\u201d\nDean lets out a breath. Pissed off is a pretty generous way of describing that.\n\u201cSo much for not freaking me out,\u201d he jokes. Then, more seriously, \u201cI\u2019m glad you got out.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry you got in,\u201d she says, grimacing. A shadow crosses her face. \u201cMost of the neighborhood watch just thinks I\u2019m crazy,\u201d she says. \u201cBut they do have a point. I don\u2019t even know how we\u2019d go about fixing whatever the hell is wrong with that place.\u201d\nThere\u2019s no way Dean\u2019s going to ruin this woman\u2019s life by confirming that everything she just said definitely does not make her crazy. Instead, he just keeps his eyes on the prize.\n\u201cHumor me here,\u201d he says, \u201cBut, assuming this ghost is real, do you have any idea who it could be? Like, who died first, y\u2019know? Who started the chain?\u201d\nJanet swallows, looking at him a little strangely. This always happens near the end of an interrogation, when the witnesses start realizing they\u2019re getting asked probably-not-department-mandated questions. Apparently it goes for new neighbors as well.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know much,\u201d she admits. \u201cThere was a fire back in the 70s that ate up a lot of old records in the town hall. I didn\u2019t look much further into things than figuring out the land under the Painter Building- way before the building itself was around- was the center of some kind of property dispute? And I mean this was way back in the day. I only know because the building was named after one of the guys who owned some of the nearby land.\u201d\n\u201cThis guy, Painter?\u201d Dean asks, \u201cWhen was he around?\u201d\n\u201cBefore the war.\u201d\n\u201cNumber one or number two?\u201d\n\u201cRevolutionary,\u201d she says.\nDean does a double take. \u201cUh, as in declaration of independence, no taxation without representation, that war?\u201d\nJanet nods, and Dean thinks, oh shit.\n\u201cWell, thanks for the history lesson,\u201d he says out loud, trying not to sound freaked out- look at that, she succeeded after all. He\u2019s never actually fought a two hundred fifty year old ghost before, and they\u2019ve taken way bigger fish than that, but it\u2019s still the kind of info that threatens a migraine and begs for alcohol to temper. His chair scrapes when he stands up. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll see you around.\u201d\n\u201cNot at your place,\u201d Janet says dryly, and Dean manages a smile.\nWhen he gets back to Cas, he doesn\u2019t even sit down. He just presses a firm hand into his shoulder, bending down so his mouth is by Cas\u2019 ear.\n\u201cWe gotta talk,\u201d he says lowly. In the background, Dean vaguely notices the music change into something slower, more romantic. The lights dim slightly. A bunch of people stand up all at once, and Dean straightens up in surprise. He watches as husbands all around him hold out a hand to their wives, and then the joined couples head towards the dance floor.\nOh, shit, he thinks for the second time in two minutes.\nSandy and Dave walk by, but stop when they get to Dean and Cas.\n\u201cWhenever the lights go down, that\u2019s supposed to be a call to everyone to make their way onto the dance floor,\u201d she says pointedly. \u201cThose that didn\u2019t come with partners pair up, and those that did, well,\u201d she pats Dave on the arm. With her other hand, she reaches out to tap Cas on the elbow. \u201cSee you boys out there,\u201d she says cheerily, and then they\u2019re whisking away.\nDean watches them go, and he\u2019s pretty sure his mouth has fallen open.\n\u201cNo way in fucking hell,\u201d he says. After a second, he looks down at Cas, scandalized, as if expecting Cas to agree.\nCas, of course, just shrugs.\n\u201cYou said you wanted to talk to me,\u201d he says. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to interrupt us on the dance floor.\u201d\nDean pinches the bridge of his nose.\n\u201cDancing isn\u2019t really my thing,\u201d he says, which is maybe the understatement of the century.\n\u201cSandy seems very intent on integrating us into town life,\u201d Cas says knowingly. \u201cMaybe we should indulge her.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not integrating into anything,\u201d Dean snaps, to remind himself more than Cas. Cas only stares at him until Dean relents with an eye roll. \u201cFine.\u201d\nCas stands up and holds out a hand, glancing around to make sure there\u2019s no one listening.\n\u201cDean Winchester, may I have this dance?\u201d he asks. He\u2019s making fun of Dean, but he\u2019s smiling as well. He wiggles his fingers a little bit.\nDean sighs dramatically, but by this point it\u2019s not for much more than keeping up appearances. Cas leads him out onto the dance floor. Dean pulls at his bow tie. \u201cI feel like a dancing monkey,\u201d he mumbles.\nCas ignores him, and when they reach an appropriately empty spot, Cas stops, leaving only a couple inches between them.\n\u201cFor what it\u2019s worth,\u201d he says, \u201cI know how to dance.\u201d\nDean snorts. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m guessing you learned how to dance from the guy who invented dancing in the first place.\u201d\nCas turns their palms so that they\u2019re simply folded around each other, stepping closer and putting his other hand on Dean\u2019s waist. Almost automatically, Dean puts a hand on Cas\u2019 back.\n\u201cNot quite,\u201d Cas says, quieter now that they\u2019re so close. His eyes are dark in the dim light, and they\u2019ve taken on a strange, liquid quality. \u201cI\u2019ve taken no formal lessons. Just\u2026 observed.\u201d\nThey start swaying on the spot, and admittedly, Dean feels like kind of a dumbass.\n\u201cDon\u2019t like\u2026 dip me,\u201d he feels the need to say. \u201cOr throw me into the air or whatever.\u201d\nCas laughs, and it feels like a private, intimate thing. There\u2019s hardly a breath between them as The Flamingos sing in the background about only having eyes for you.\n\u201cI think the music choice restricts me in that area,\u201d Cas assures him. His hand is so warm against Dean\u2019s waist. \u201cI promise to save my \u2018moves\u2019 for another time.\u201d\nDean quirks an eyebrow. \u201cYour \u2018moves\u2019?\u201d he asks, amused. Then, less sure, \u201c\u2018another time?\u2019\u201d\nCas doesn\u2019t reply, just watches him intently. He\u2019s so soft in this lighting. Dean\u2019s heart twists in his chest, swaying along to the music regardless.\nThey\u2019re teetering again. Always teetering, the two of them.\nThere\u2019s almost no space between them. It would be so easy to sway in, to finally let the current take him. He drops his gaze to Cas\u2019 mouth briefly, then loses his nerve and drops it further. He stares firmly at Cas\u2019 chest.\n\u201cDean,\u201d Cas says.\nHe waits until Dean finally looks up at him. They\u2019re staring at each other, and Dean thinks, now, finally. Something.\nAnd then the song ends, and the sound of a room full of dress shoes taking a couple steps back reminds him of exactly where they are. Some people clap, and Dean rolls his eyes, feeling the tension between him and Cas ebbing away again, diluting among the crowd. He steps away from Cas, dropping both his hands back to his sides. Across the room, he makes eye contact with Sandy, who winks. He smiles weakly back.\n\u201cYou wanted to talk to me,\u201d Cas says. \u201cI assume it wasn\u2019t about dancing technique.\u201d\nDean coughs. \u201cYeah, I\u2026 got distracted,\u201d he says. He glances around. \u201cLook, you think we can just go? I got some info and I doubt we\u2019ll get much more from this crowd.\u201d\nCas nods. \u201cI suppose,\u201d he says. \u201cThe man I was talking to had a lot to say about gardening, which I appreciate, but was less than helpful when it came to our case.\u201d\n\u201cAwesome,\u201d Dean says, meeting Sandy\u2019s eye one last time and waving. For good measure, he puts an arm around Cas. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\n***\nOn the way home, Dean fills Cas in on their potentially great-great-great-great-great pal, Painter. Cas texts Sam with the details, and Sam promises to dig up what he can.\nDean\u2019s just locked the apartment door behind them when a tingle goes down his spine.\n\u201cHey,\u201d he says to Cas, who\u2019s a couple steps ahead, \u201cYou feel t-\u201d And then he\u2019s flung halfway across the room, falling painfully on his side. As he struggles to sit up, he sees Cas slumped against the back of the door, grimacing in pain.\nTamping down on the panic mode he always wants to fall into whenever he sees Cas-as-a-human-aka-fragile get hurt, Dean scrambles to the coffee table where he put an iron crow bar just earlier today. They put salt all around the apartment, so Dean grabs the box there and tosses it in Cas\u2019 direction.\nYeah, protective hex bags aren\u2019t gonna do a damn thing against this ghost.\nDean scans the room carefully, but nothing else seems to be out of place. He takes a step forward, and is about to order Cas into the bedroom where he at least hopes the amount of sigils in there will ward it off for now, when he gets tossed again, this time down the dark hallway.\n\u201cDean!\u201d he hears Cas shout out in panic.\nDean lands on his face and hears something crack in his nose as it hits off the wood flooring. He\u2019s voting for carpet next time.\nHe rolls over with a groan, head pounding and at least a couple ribs bruised from that first hit. When he looks up, there\u2019s a dark figure walking down the hallway toward him. Dean can feel the rage emanating off this thing, and imagines feeling that way for over two centuries.\nIf things with the Mark had gone differently\u2026\nNo time for that line of thinking. Dean tightens his grip on the handle of the crow bar as the thing gets closer. Dean times his swing for when it\u2019s just close enough to him, and as he fights from the floor, he watches as an entire box of salt is upended over its head from behind. It disappears along with the shower of salt, and all that\u2019s left is Cas standing there, empty box in his hand.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a little overkill, don\u2019t you think? We only have six million more boxes,\u201d Dean tries to joke, but his vision is swimming a little and his breathing is tight.\nCas bends down in front of Dean, and it looks like there are two of him instead of one, but at least neither of them is bleeding anywhere Dean can see. Both Cas\u2019 reach out to him, but only one pair of hands cup his face.\n\u201cLook at me, Dean,\u201d Cas orders. Dean blinks sluggishly and obeys. Cas first probes carefully at his nose, making Dean wince. Cas murmurs an apology, then just looks into his eyes for a moment.\n\u201cNo concussion,\u201d he decides, voice somehow both relieved and tight with worry, \u201cBut you need to rest.\u201d He grabs Dean\u2019s arm and hauls him up gently, bringing him into their room. \u201cThe sigils will work,\u201d Cas assures him as he helps Dean get in bed, \u201cFor another week, maybe.\u201d\n\u201cOh, great,\u201d Dean says, his injured noise making him sound like he has a head cold.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have it figured out by then,\u201d Cas says firmly, then exits the room.\n\u201cCas!\u201d Dean hisses. \u201cCas!\u201d What kind of fucking moron just leaves the one safe zone when there\u2019s an old ass ghost jonesing for a fight just outside?\nCas is back in literally twenty seconds, a damp washcloth in hand. Dean glares at him.\n\u201cReally?\u201d he snaps.\n\u201cReally,\u201d Cas says, sitting on the edge of the bed. He cradles the back of Dean\u2019s head gently as he wipes the blood from his nose away. \u201cTake your shirt off,\u201d he commands next, and normally Dean would complain but he just shrugs out of it tonight, fighting with the fucking suspenders until Cas silently unclips them from his belt loops. He wriggles out of his pants as well because he\u2019s too tired to care, and sits up, sheets pooling at his waist as Cas once again checks out his injuries.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s just bruising,\u201d Cas says, and his fingers on Dean\u2019s side make him think of Cas\u2019 hand on Dean\u2019s waist as they danced earlier. \u201cMaybe don\u2019t sleep on this side tonight.\u201d\n\u201cThanks, doc,\u201d Dean says. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d\n\u201cMy injuries are superficial,\u201d Cas says, turning off the light and walking around to his side of the bed, shucking clothes as he goes. It\u2019s decidedly unsexy, but Dean finds himself entranced anyway. Also, it\u2019s kind of funny to watch two (now one and a half) Cas\u2019 stripping.\nCas slides into bed, and Dean realizes that not sleeping on the side with the bruises means he has to sleep on the side that ends up with him staring at Cas all night. Cas rolls over so he\u2019s facing Dean, watching him carefully.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s a little weird that we\u2019re still sleeping in a bedroom in a haunted apartment with a ghost that wants to kill us?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be less weird now that the ghost is here?\u201d Cas asks. \u201cNow it\u2019s just a simple case again.\u201d\nThis was never just a simple case, Dean doesn\u2019t say. Instead, he says, \u201cYeah, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\nSilence falls between them for a moment, but Cas doesn\u2019t seem interested in turning away like Dean expects him to. Dean can just barely see him blinking in the dark, the moonlight coming in through the window barely washing over his features.\n\u201cSometimes I wish I was still an angel,\u201d Cas says quietly. \u201cNot because I miss it, but because I could heal you with a simple touch. I could burn that ghost out by merely looking at it, and then none of this would have happened.\u201d\nDean swallows. It had taken weeks for Cas to finally come around after falling. Not that Dean was surprised, since he\u2019s pretty sure species-changes rank pretty high on the \u201cmost stressful things ever\u201d list. But he had adjusted eventually, learning how to carve out his own small space in the world like all people do. He likes gardening and stray cats that make Dean sneeze. He likes fabric softener and the Food Network and the Discovery Channel. Earlier this year, he and Dean had watched Shark Week together, curled up on separate ends of the couch for hours at a time, drinking beers and bickering over which shark was best.\nSometimes, he still gets that faraway look in his eyes, and Dean can relate, to an extent. Cas is mourning a part of himself, something that\u2019s gone and never coming back, no matter how many stray cats he pets or how many flowers he plants in the springtime. Dean wasn\u2019t in hell for near as long as Cas had been an angel, but he knows what it\u2019s like to leave something of yourself behind. It\u2019s not something that ever goes away, really, and the emptiness where that piece used to be can\u2019t be filled up by food or beer or sex or even love. Not that Dean\u2019s an expert in coping or grief by any means necessary, (though really, he should be by now with all the people he\u2019s lost) but he did what he could to help Cas through. Tried to explain that though the emptiness was there, it wasn\u2019t the only thing that was there.\n\u201cYou\u2019re more than what you\u2019re not, Cas,\u201d Dean had promised.\nAnd he\u2019s stuck to that promise as well as he can. He doesn\u2019t let himself wish for Cas\u2019 mojo anymore. He doesn\u2019t let himself dwell on how Cas used to be able to drop in at a moment\u2019s notice to save the day. When him or Sam get smacked around by their monster of the week, he doesn\u2019t think about how Cas healed him way back when in Lucifer\u2019s Crypt with a hand cupping his cheek. \u00a0\nCas has expressed similar regrets before, and Dean refuses to take the bait, like always.\n\u201cThe only reason I\u2019d want you to be an angel again is so you could read my mind and know for sure that I don\u2019t care about any of that shit, Cas,\u201d Dean says. \u201cWe do how we always do, regardless of a bumped head or a bloody nose.\u201d\n\u201cOne day it\u2019s going to be more than that,\u201d Cas says, not as if he wants to contradict Dean, but like he\u2019s stating a sad, inevitable truth of the universe. Which he is.\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s not going to be today,\u201d Is all Dean can offer, because he\u2019s more than aware of this fact as well. So maybe he lied. Maybe he\u2019d want Cas to be an angel again if it meant Cas being able to heal himself, in case it ever came down to it. But that train left the station a long time ago, so Dean does what he always does, and deals.\nDealing, of course, meaning that, not for the first time, Dean wonders what his life- and Cas\u2019, and Sam\u2019s- would be like if their lives weren\u2019t always hanging by one thread or another. If possible death didn\u2019t wait for them around every corner and down every dark alleyway.\nHis epiphany from earlier today nags at him. Yeah, maybe Cas could pass as a legit street magician in Vegas. Maybe Dean still sees black eyes when he looks in the mirror. Maybe they\u2019ll never live that white picket fence life that Dean fantasized about for years. Really, it\u2019s just not feasible.\nBut normality is relative, isn\u2019t it? Dean doesn\u2019t want to have climb into bed every night, thankful that Cas just managed to survive the hunt of the day by the skin of his teeth. As the years have gone on, and the family around Dean has dwindled low enough to count on one hand, he\u2019s found his priorities shifting and re-shifting. It was always about keeping his family together, but then it was about keeping himself together so he could keep the world together. Then for a long time, it was just about the world, and everyone stopped caring about Dean\u2019s little family. They kept it together with shoestring and twine, escaping with barely an inch of wiggle room. But then the world kept spinning, because it didn\u2019t care. It kept taking people away that Dean loved, and he slowly stopped being about the world again. This hunk of rock will keep spinning, he promised himself. Someone will always save it, but they sure as hell won\u2019t save you and your own.\u00a0\nSo that\u2019s what they tried to do. After heaven and hell got sealed back up like they finally belonged, Dean and Sam and Cas set out to save themselves, and save others and their own.\nThat\u2019s not so bad, Dean thinks. There\u2019s nothing much warmer, or safer, or more normal than the three of them in the Impala, the taste of the interstate in the air and the rumble of the engine below.\nActually, Dean concedes, this here, Cas warm and safe and normal beside him might give the Impala a run for her money (not that Dean would ever tell her that).\nHe falls asleep warm.\n***\nDean wakes early the next morning, and to his very great surprise, Cas isn\u2019t beside him. Dean can probably count on one hand the amount of times Cas has ever willingly gotten up before 10am of his own volition, and when he glances at his phone and realizes it\u2019s not even 7 yet, he can feel the question marks hovering over him like those cartoon birds people hallucinate when they get hit on the head.\nSaid question marks turn to exclamation points when he can\u2019t find Cas anywhere in the apartment, and then bolded exclamation points when he notices Cas\u2019 coat is gone. He grabs his own jacket and shoves on his boots, tromping down the stairs and feeling strangely weird about waking up with an empty spot next to him instead of the human version of a grumpy dumpster cat.\nThe Impala hasn\u2019t moved, and Dean searches around for a while before spotting Cas kneeling by the river behind their building, staring out at it. For about three seconds Dean gets hurled back into the greys and browns of purgatory, the relief he felt thrumming through his teeth and his fingertips and his ribcage at the sight of Cas, dirty and rumpled and alive, crouched by the river that they would eventually use to help guide them home.\nHe shakes his head, because this isn\u2019t purgatory. This isn\u2019t live or die. This is just Cas by a river in a small town in Vermont. Dean knows Cas knows he\u2019s here, but he doesn\u2019t say anything. Dean walks up beside him, standing slightly behind him. Cas\u2019 breath puffs out of him in small white clouds. It\u2019s frigid out this morning, the world frosty.\u00a0\n\u201cI woke up and you weren\u2019t there,\u201d Dean says stupidly, like Cas should\u2019ve left a note or something.\nCas doesn\u2019t look up at him, just drapes an arm over his knee and lets it swing against his shin. The casualness with which he moves still startles Dean sometimes, despite the fact that even for a long time before Cas fell he was exhibiting a human tick here, a human quirk there.\nAnd before he fell, of course, Cas was star stuff, asteroid dust, God\u2019s dandruff, whatever. The cosmos poured into a jar, taking the shape of whatever container it occupies. Even though Dean may not always have seen it, Cas has always flowed.\n\u00a0\u201cI should have left a note,\u201d Cas says, \u201cSorry.\u201d\nDean says, \u201cOh,\u201d because being on the same wavelength with Cas is weird. He sighs and stretches, the cold air making his eyes water. \u201cWhat are you doing out here so early? I didn\u2019t even know you were aware there was a 7 in the morning.\u201d\n\u201cI woke up\u2026 agitated,\u201d Cas says. \u201cI came out here to walk it off.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, did I kick you in my sleep or something?\u201d Dean asks, even though he\u2019s really saying \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nCas turns back to look up at him, but doesn\u2019t say anything. Finally, Dean gives in and scuffs his boot on the ground, then parks himself next to Cas, freezing his damn ass off.\n\u201cYou\u2019re very warm,\u201d Cas tells him, like he\u2019s talking about the weather. \u201cIt was strange waking up to.\u201d\nDean bites the inside of his cheek for a moment.\n\u201cWeren\u2019t you the one who said this didn\u2019t matter because we\u2019ve already done this a million times before?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cI was,\u201d Cas agrees, \u201cAnd we have. I didn\u2019t realize it would be\u2026 different.\u201d\n\u201cDifferent how?\u201d\nCas definitely knows the answer to this question, and Dean probably knows the answer to this question, but neither of them answer it.\nThey sit together and watch the frozen river sludge its way to its destination.\n***\nThey meet up with Sam again at the Italian place, and he comes prepared. He lays a crapload of old photocopies of various records from the town hall on the table in front of them, watching Dean pointedly. There\u2019s a lot to sift through, but there\u2019s still a bunch he couldn\u2019t get his hands on because of the fire back in the 70s.\n\u201cThought it wasn\u2019t a good idea we meet up while you two are working on your whole\u2026 charade,\u201d Sam says innocently.\n\u201cYeah, well, this ghost is pissed and we need all hands on deck. Easier to do research over tortellini than the phone.\u201d\n\u201cOh, now you wanna do research.\u201d\n\u201cNo, now I wanna deck you.\u201d Dean dramatically picks up his menu and starts turning pages. \u201cBut far be it from me to make a scene in a wholesome family restaurant.\u201d\nSam smirks at Cas, \u201cGuess you\u2019re a good influence on him.\u201d\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Dean says.\n\u201cActually,\u201d Cas says, \u201cIf you recall, it was Dean who convinced me to rebel against the entirety of heaven and everything I\u2019ve ever known to help you two stop the apocalypse. If anything, Dean has been a good influence on me.\u201d\nSilence falls over the table, Sam grinning like the cat who just the cream, and Dean staring fixedly at the salt and pepper shakers while his cheeks redden. Cas stares out the window, blas\u00e9 as ever. As if rebelling against the entire host of heaven based on faith in one human is just a normal thing to do. \u00a0\n\u201cAw,\u201d Sam says, grinning at the two of them.\nDean shakes the salt shaker at his brother, covering Sam in little white beads.\n\u201cAway, demon,\u201d he says flatly.\nSam flicks a grain of salt off his shoulder, but doesn\u2019t stop grinning.\nAt that same moment, a friendly voice says, \u201cwell, hello there, gentlemen!\u201d and it\u2019s the same waitress from last time, smiling brightly at them. \u201cWelcome back!\u201d\n\u201cHello again,\u201d Cas says, smiling gently, while Dean gruffly nods and Sam continues to pick salt off himself.\n\u201cHave you two settled in yet?\u201d the waitress asks as she pours water into their glasses, glancing between Dean and Cas. Her question is obviously an innocent one, but Dean finds himself caught off guard that somehow she managed to suss out it was him and Cas doing the renting. The implication that the two of them give off the impression of being together is terrifying, despite the fact that was exactly what they were going for. Dean\u2019s palms start to sweat.\n\u201cWho says it was us doing the renting?\u201d Dean asks a little too aggressively, and immediately feels bad because the waitress\u2019 face turns a deep red, and she tucks a strand of mortified hair behind her ear.\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d she says, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to presume- I just thought the two of you-\u201d she swallows, \u201cGod, sorry, I shouldn\u2019t have- shouldn\u2019t have assumed.\u201d\nDean gets twin kicks from Sam and Cas under the table, and tries to plaster a reconciliatory smile on his face. He clears his throat.\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d he says, much softer. He takes a deep breath, glancing at Cas beside him, who\u2019s watching him patiently. \u201cYou were right, but we were kinda planning on taking that part slow. New place new town, y\u2019know?\u201d\nThe waitress nods furiously. \u201cGosh, no, of course,\u201d she says, still deeply embarrassed. She shakes her head slightly, digging in her apron for a notebook, fumbling it as she pulls it out and flips it open.\nShe takes their orders after that, Dean trying to be as not-gruff as possible when he tells her he wants the cannelloni. Cas taps his toe to Dean\u2019s shin much lighter this time, just briefly, and Dean catches himself staring into the middle distance as Sam orders something with the word \u201cparmesan\u201d in it.\nAfter she leaves, Dean watches her duck desperately back into the kitchen and he feels like even more of an ass. Across the table, Sam shakes his head.\n\u201cYou really need to chill,\u201d he says. \u201cHoly crap.\u201d \u00a0\nInstead of arguing, Dean just says, \u201cTrust me, I know,\u201d and stares down determinedly at the town hall records. His chest unclenches just a little when Cas\u2019 foot gently bumps into his own and stays there for the duration of their meal.\n***\nThe records turn out to be useless, which, no surprise there. Once their waitress comes back with their check, she hovers briefly, biting her lip. She looks at Dean again.\n\u201cUm, I just wanted to say,\u201d she says nervously, \u201cHighbury isn\u2019t perfect or anything, but it is nice.\u201d She shoves both her hands in her pockets, and looks down at her feet for a moment, as if gathering her nerve. When she looks back up, her whole face has changed. It\u2019s gone soft and reverent, and she smiles like she\u2019s thinking the happiest thoughts in the universe. She says, \u201cMy girlfriend and I love it here, and I think you will too.\u201d\nBefore Dean can say anything to that, she nods at all of them and wishes them a good night, and then takes her leave. As she walks away, Dean sees her slip her phone out of her apron and start typing away. It\u2019s not too difficult to guess who she\u2019s texting.\nDean looks at Cas, and Cas is looking right back at him. Obviously their waitress wasn\u2019t the only one feeling soft and reverent tonight, and Cas\u2019 gaze makes Dean\u2019s chest tight.\n\u201cThat actually was really sweet,\u201d Sam says seriously as he slides out of the booth. \u201cGuess she decided you weren\u2019t a heathen after all, Dean.\u201d\n\u201cIt really was,\u201d Dean finds himself agreeing as he digs out his wallet. He makes sure to leave a very generous tip.\nCas says he has to go to the bathroom, so Dean and Sam head out to the Impala, freezing their asses off between the restaurant and their parking spot. Once they\u2019re inside with the heat cranked and Dean\u2019s still rubbing his hands together to try and generate some friction, he peers inside the diner and notices Cas speaking to their waitress. They\u2019re off to the side, and his head is down like they\u2019re keeping their voices low.\n\u201cBathroom my ass,\u201d Dean says.\nHe waits until they drop Sam back off at his motel, and on the deserted stretch of highway back to town, he pulls off on the shoulder of the road, the engine clicking in the sudden silence. He stares out the windshield as he says, \u201cI saw you talking to that waitress back at the diner. What\u2019s up?\u201d He\u2019s not sure why he felt the need to pull the car over for this conversation, but since he did, he lets his gaze swivel towards Cas and hold. In the dark, Cas looks almost ethereal. Dean feels the stirrings of lightning under his fingernails.\nCas turns towards him, and a shaft of moonlight plays over his face, washing out his color. His eyes go arctic blue, just like they do in bright sunlight. It\u2019s just Dean\u2019s mind playing tricks on him, but this looks like Cas the angel, not Cas the human. Not that it ever seems to matter, because Cas will always be Cas and Cas will always be it for Dean, no matter his species, no matter how hot his own face gets when he thinks about it all too hard.\nBut for what it\u2019s worth, Cas the angel had never rocked third day stubble.\n\u201cI was just curious,\u201d Cas says thoughtfully, though his words carry a very specific kind of weight. \u201cI asked her what led her to believe that we were together, under the guise of us still wanting to keep things \u2018low profile\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cAnd?\u201d Dean asks, suddenly nervous. His entire relationship with Cas flashes before his eyes, and he wonders if everyone\u2019s been able to see it all this time. If he\u2019s worn it as plain as the clothes on his back, as obvious as the handprint on his shoulder.\nCas tilts his head, a small smile pulling at his lips.\n\u201cShe said it was how we looked at each other,\u201d he says, \u201chow we moved around each other, like it was the most natural thing in the world. How you put an arm across the top of the bench and your fingertips were mere inches from the back of my neck, and we were both intimately aware of that fact. How I stole a bite of your food without asking and you only half rolled your eyes, and fondly\u2026\u201d his smile turns mischievous. \u201cHow you checked out my ass when I got up to use the washroom before we left.\u201d\nDean makes a strange sound in the back of his throat. \u201cThere\u2019s no way she said all that,\u201d he says hoarsely, his heart fluttering against his ribcage. He doesn\u2019t deny any of it, though.\n\u201cI may have embellished slightly,\u201d Cas says, deadpan.\nDean watches him for a long time, unsure of what to say. So eventually, he just nods and says \u201cokay\u201d and then starts the car again.\nOn the way home, Cas puts his arm across the back of the seat, and his fingertips ever so gently brush the nape of Dean\u2019s neck.\n***\nThey spend the next couple of days skirting around the Painter building, trying not to get their faces ripped off by any pissed ghosts. Technically, ghosts are just as powerful during the day as they are at night, but any serious activity in the daylight is unlikely. Ghosts do have a penchant for the dramatic, after all. Especially ones that have stuck around for as (potentially) long as this one has.\nThey talk to the people on the other floors, and other than a handful of stories similar to what they\u2019ve already heard, they find nothing new. But from what they gather, no serious incidents have occurred lately, which both relieve and worry Dean and Cas.\n\u201cIt could be gearing up for something big,\u201d Dean says, back in their apartment. \u201cQuiet before the storm kind of thing.\u201d\n\u201cIt could also just be focused on us,\u201d Cas says. \u201cIt might see us as more of a threat.\u201d\nThey\u2019ve since painted sigils all around the apartment, and it seems to have worked to an extent. Dean swears he\u2019s lost his razor and Cas is missing a shoe, but other than that they haven\u2019t had a visit from the ghost since the first night.\nBetween research sessions with Sam, they think that this guy Painter must be the ghost. Thanks to Sam sweet talking a librarian from the next town over who apparently holds some kind of grudge against Highbury\u2019s library, they managed to gather at least a little bit of intel on their guy. Back in the early 1700s, when land was still being settled and towns still being formed, there was a big disagreement in this county who, exactly, would have the village center on their land. Apparently, it was a wildly competitive race, with potential owners fighting and trying to off each other at every turn. There was a ton of backstabbing, a ton of in-fighting, and a ton of threats that may or may not have ended up turning out to be legitimate.\nPainter won the land in the end, and his hands were probably the dirtiest. Not long after winning the land, he too mysteriously vanished, most likely murdered by those he had wronged.\nThe only problem, of course, is that\u2019s where the trail goes cold. And even if they knew where he was buried, there would be nothing to dig up because a body that old would have completely decomposed by now. Generally, Sam and Dean have found over the years that if a spirit is attached to a body, that body has to be reasonably intact for it to happen. \u00a0\n\u201cThere has to be something,\u201d Dean says, dragging a hand down his face. \u201cSomething that got passed down through the family, or a lock of hair, or a goddam toenail. Ghosts can\u2019t exist without being tied to something.\u201d\n\u201cPainter had no siblings, no nieces or nephews. No children, no wife. He was the last of his line,\u201d Cas says. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have had anyone to pass anything down to.\u201d\n\u201cNo official children,\u201d Dean says, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t have \u2018em.\u201d\nCas is silent for a moment before saying slowly, \u201cWhat about something more intangible?\u201d He looks pointedly around the room. \u201cThis building carries his name, after all. And as far as the research says, there were no suspicious deaths here before the building was built.\u201d\n\u201cCould be something,\u201d Dean agrees, \u201cBut it could also just be the fact that it\u2019s hard as hell to find records of anything that old and that obscure.\u201d\nCas glances out the window at the darkening sky, sighing.\n\u201cWhatever it is,\u201d he says, \u201cWe need to hurry up and find it.\u201d\nPerhaps ominously, a knock on the door punctuates Cas\u2019 statement. Sam\u2019s officially Not Allowed at the apartment, just in case, so it\u2019s definitely someone they probably don\u2019t want to see. Dean looks nervously around the room, not wanting anything to potentially raise any eyebrows. All the painted sigils are hidden behind furniture at least, but Dean grabs the crow bar on the table, sliding it under the couch and just out of the sight.\n\u201cJust a second!\u201d he yells towards the door as he waves at Cas to help him grab the boxes of salt they had on the table, shoving them into a still-empty cupboard in the kitchen.\n\u201cGo close the bedroom door,\u201d he tells Cas, another precaution. The sigils are way more obvious in there, and they still have salt lining the windows and doorway.\nCas disappears down the hallway and Dean opens the door to find Helen on the other side. She\u2019s not near as perfectly coiffed as she was a couple days ago, and though she looks like she\u2019s trying to cover up some severe exhaustion, Dean can still see the bags under her eyes.\n\u201cLeo!\u201d she greets, and there\u2019s a slight pull to her voice, \u201cHow are you tonight?\u201d Her eyes flick over his shoulder, glancing into the apartment.\n\u201cHey, Helen, we\u2019re good. What can I do for you?\u201d He steps back to give himself some room, but Helen misinterprets it as an invitation, smiling at him as she walks in.\n\u201cThe place looks great,\u201d she says, looking around, \u201cDidn\u2019t take you long to settle in at all.\u201d\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t,\u201d Cas says, emerging from the hallway as he joins the conversation. \u201cHow are you, Helen?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m excellent, thank you,\u201d she says, and Dean feels his expression turn doubtful. \u201cI just wanted to check in on you two, make sure you were adjusting okay. Did you have any questions? Was there anything you needed?\u201d\nDean glances at Cas.\n\u201cI think we\u2019re good,\u201d he says, \u201cThanks. We went to that monthly neighborhood watch thingy the other day and everyone-\u201d Bit of an exaggeration, but whatever- \u201cwas really, uh, welcoming.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Helen says, tone cooling. She nods, as if in understanding. \u201cLet me guess,\u201d she says, \u201cSandy and Dave?\u201d\n\u201cThey invited us, yes,\u201d Cas begins, and he\u2019s about to say something else but Helen cuts him off.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve gotta be careful with that lot,\u201d she warns the two of them, and Dean feels his eyebrows rise when he sees a genuine spike of malice behind her eyes. \u201cThey\u2019re not good for much more than fear mongering and trouble stirring.\u201d\nDean thinks about everything Janet and the other residents of the Painter building have told him.\n\u201cHuh,\u201d he says innocently, \u201cThey seemed a little argumentative, maybe. I mean, to me, politics is mostly squabbling anyway, but they had good intentions as far as I saw.\u201d\nHelen\u2019s mouth twists slightly.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to overburden you with our town\u2019s silly little disagreements in your first week here,\u201d she says, with somewhat forced sweetness. She keeps trying to get a better look at the apartment, and Dean thinks, yeah, definitely scoping the place out.\nHe shouldn\u2019t be surprised, honestly. Evil landlord is right up there with mustache twirling villain. Isn\u2019t there some kind of urban legend about the little old landlady who spikes people\u2019s drinks with cyanide? Dean\u2019ll have to write this one down for the Men of Letters\u2019 playbooks for sure.\nDean holds up his hands genially. \u201cHey,\u201d he says, \u201cNo worries. We\u2019re still learning the lay of the land, right babe?\u201d He shoots Cas a tiny, significant look, but all it takes is a blink in return and Dean knows Cas is in on it.\n\u201cRight,\u201d he says, tensing up just slightly.\nHelen nods, seeming to feel the tension in the room that just ratcheted up.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to intrude like this,\u201d she apologizes, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to interrupt you if you were working.\u201d\n\u201cUhh\u2026\u201d Dean was expecting some kind of pointed remark that would lead to an inevitable showdown where he and Cas get the info they need from her to gank the ghost and get the fuck outta dodge, but apparently his brain is moving way faster than the rest of this conversation. \u201cNnnnno,\u201d he says awkwardly. \u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d He throws a confused glance Cas\u2019 way, and Cas shrugs slightly.\n\u201cI have to admit,\u201d Helen says, \u201cI had an ulterior motive for visiting tonight.\u201d\nOh, okay, this is it. Dean flexes his fingers. She\u2019s just a little late on the delivery is all.\n\u201cI was hoping to get my plate back,\u201d she says. \u201cFrom the lemon squares?\u201d\nFor two seconds Dean is convinced that \u201clemon squares\u201d is a code word that\u2019ll like, sic a ghost on them or something, and then he remembers that the first day they moved in she actually gave them lemon squares.\n\u201c\u2026 oh,\u201d he says after a long pause. Somewhere out there in the universe, a record is scratching dramatically. \u201cUh\u2026 Yeah. I\u2019ll grab it for you.\u201d\nHe takes the clean plate out of the dishwasher (the squares themselves were actually really really good) and brings it out to her.\n\u201cThanks,\u201d he says to her, almost making it sound like a question. \u201cThey were great.\u201d Is he complimenting an evil or just nosy landlord\u2019s baking?\nHelen smiles tiredly at them. \u201cI hate to intrude,\u201d she says again. \u201cI really hope I didn\u2019t interrupt anything.\u201d\nSince she seems so worried, Dean plasters on a fake smile and puts an arm around Cas. \u201cAre you kidding?\u201d he says. \u201cAfter nine years together I\u2019m still convinced this guy just plays Minesweeper all day.\u201d\nHelen\u2019s brows briefly draw together and at the same time, out of her view, Cas pinches the back of Dean\u2019s arm, hard.\n\u201cLeo\u2019s not so great with numbers,\u201d Cas says smoothly, \u201cHonestly, sometimes I think he mistakes my spreadsheets for a computer game.\u201d\nDean\u2019s about to protest, but Cas snakes an arm around his waist and keeps a grip tight enough to let Dean know to keep his mouth shut.\n\u201cThanks for stopping by, Helen,\u201d he says, dragging Dean forwards with him as he ushers her towards the door. \u201cIt was kind of you to check up on us.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, well, let me know if you need anything else!\u201d she says, and there\u2019s still that slightly off-note to her voice that registers strangely to Dean.\n\u201cGood night,\u201d Cas says, and then he\u2019s closing the door.\n\u201cDude, what the hell was that?\u201d Dean snaps, rubbing his arm.\nCas holds out a hand, ear pressed to the door. After a moment, he glares at Dean.\n\u201cNine years?\u201d he asks, \u201cReally? Because a couple of days ago, it was eight years.\u201d\nDean rewinds the conversation, mentally smacking himself over the head.\n\u201cOh, shit,\u201d he says. \u201cYou think she noticed?\u201d\n\u201cShe noticed,\u201d Cas says flatly.\n\u201cWell. Ugh. Fuck, Cas, I was a little too busy thinking we were about to get torn apart by her or her pet ghosts or whatever. Tell me you weren\u2019t getting that super sketchy vibe too?\u201d\n\u201cOf course I was, Dean. But it\u2019s going to be more difficult to get information from her because now she knows something\u2019s up.\u201d\nDean throws his hands up in the air, more annoyed at himself than Cas, \u201cWe can go make out in front of her right now, Cas, huh? How about that? Maybe that\u2019ll bring her back over to our side.\u201d As he speaks, he knows his eyes involuntarily flicker down to Cas\u2019 mouth. He swallows.\nCas watches him darkly, and Dean feels that familiar electric magnetism pulsing between them again, like it tends to do. The air practically vibrates with it. Without him even realizing, Cas has backed him up against the door, standing less than a foot away.\n\u201cYou think that\u2019ll convince her?\u201d he asks, voice low, almost suggestive. Dean\u2019s heart picks up the pace.\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s not her that needs to be convinced,\u201d Dean says quietly.\nFor a brief second, Cas pulls back slightly, blinking at him owlishly in the semi-darkness of the apartment. Then, his gaze narrows in on Dean\u2019s, intent clear. He leans in, and when their mouths are inches from touching, the lights suddenly flicker, and the lamp over in the corner blows out with a bright spattering of sparks.\nDean\u2019s immediately heading for the couch to grab the crowbar, but Cas grabs his arm before he can go any further.\n\u201cWait, Dean,\u201d he says, and sounds more frustrated than anything else.\nDean tries to pull away, \u201cDude, we have company,\u201d he says, panicked, gesturing at the lamp.\nCas rolls his eyes.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the ghost, Dean. It was my mistake.\u201d\nDean stops pulling away from Cas, but Cas still holds onto his arm.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he asks, confused.\nCas sighs. \u201cConsider it part of my \u2018magic tricks\u2019,\u201d he says, sounding put out. \u201cIt happens sometimes.\u201d\nDean stares at him.\n\u201cYou just been randomly blowing fuses for over a year?\u201d he asks. \u201cAnd have somehow failed to mention this?\u201d He thinks back to tiny little things that have happened since Cas fell. The lights in the bunker flickering once or twice, his new alarm clock fizzing out after only a week, the bulb in the fridge that stopped working.\nCas shrugs. \u201cIt took me a while to figure out I was even the cause of it, and then I just\u2026 dealt with it,\u201d he says.\nDean continues to stare at him. Finally, he huffs a laugh. Cas lets go of his arm, and the tension dissipates.\n\u201cY\u2019know, if we paid an electric bill for the bunker, I\u2019d send it to you,\u201d he says.\n\u201cI would just use our money to pay it, but I appreciate the gesture,\u201d Cas says.\nDean snorts. \u201cYou and sparks,\u201d he says fondly, \u201cEver since first meeting in that barn. Always a flair for the dramatic.\u201d\n\u201cI tried to keep it as low-key as possible,\u201d Cas assures him dryly. \u201cI know how you are about surprises.\u201d\n***\nThey invite Helen to dinner. Since they aren\u2019t quite 100% convinced yet that she\u2019s an evil hellbeast or witch or ghost or whatever, they have to lie low on the threats for now, and see if she\u2019ll give anything up either by accident or involuntarily.\nIf she\u2019s not a hellbeast at all, then their only goal is to prove to her just how A-grade-farm-fed legitimately her two newest tenants actually are in a relationship.\nDean\u2019s much more afraid of the second option, mostly because he has way less experience with it.\nThey both stand behind the door in the silence after her first knock. She\u2019s exactly on time.\nDean takes a deep breath. \u201cReady to play?\u201d he asks, straightening his sweater nervously. He honestly never thought he\u2019d see the day where both him and Cas were wearing sweaters.\nCas nods, stepping fractionally closer to Dean. The warmth he brings with him relaxes Dean, and the hand on his lower back is startling at first, but Dean quickly finds himself leaning into it.\nThis is good, he thinks. Helen\u2019ll eat this up.\nThey had discussed earlier in the night how exactly to play their cool-not-cool game.\n\u201cWhat do normal couples do?\u201d Cas had asked, arms crossed, like he knew this was a futile endeavor. (It is, because Dean and Cas have never been anything other than Dean and Cas.)\n\u201cShit, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Dean had said, and that was very quickly the end of that.\nDean barely has time to register how nice Cas\u2019 hand feels right where it is before Cas is opening the door and inviting Helen inside with a smile. She still looks exhausted, like she\u2019s been up all night doing landlordy (or evil) things. Obviously oblivious to their suspicions, she graciously offers up a large bowlful of Caesar salad.\n\u201cFor the lasagne,\u201d she says. \u201cYou said you were making lasagne, right?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cUh. Yeah, of course,\u201d Dean says, deciding to be polite and resist stating that putting that much meat and cheese next to that much greenery is just unholy. (He catches a whiff of the dressing as he puts it in the fridge, and maybe that changes his mind. A little. In fact, Dean may have come around to the fact in the past few years that not all green things are terrible, but he knows that if he doesn\u2019t hold this grudge against salad until the day he dies, Sam will become absolutely impossible to deal with.)\nCas walks her into the living room, offering her wine. As Dean lurks in the kitchen, he listens to Cas smoothly cajole her into a glass. He really is slick when he wants to be. Dean pulls three glasses out of the cupboard (they had to go buy a matching one today for the occasion) and waits against the counter for Cas to walk in.\n\u201cSmooth,\u201d he says quietly, and the corner of Cas\u2019 mouth ticks up.\n\u201cI figured alcohol may loosen her tongue a bit,\u201d he shrugs, taking the wine (another purchase from today) and filling each glass about halfway. He lightly bumps Dean\u2019s hip with his own. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t linger too long.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Dean says, \u201cShe might think we\u2019re up to something.\u201d\nHe gets a soft laugh for that, and Dean can\u2019t help but smile.\nThey keep the topics neutral for the majority of before dinner conversation. The smell of lasagne starts to waft through the apartment, and soon enough Helen is sniffing at the air, obviously excited.\n\u201cThat smells delicious,\u201d she says, \u201cGoodness, maybe you should have been making me the lemon bars.\u201d\nDean\u2019s about to laugh and brush her off, but before he can Cas steps in, putting a hand on Dean\u2019s knee. Dean\u2019s suddenly so focused on that point of contact that he barely hears Cas say, \u201cHe really is, though sometimes he\u2019s too modest to admit it.\u201d He looks at Helen as if he\u2019s sharing a secret with her, \u201cHe loves to remind me all the time, though. It\u2019s how he gets me to always do the less exciting chores.\u201d\nHelen laughs, and Dean wonders if there\u2019s an award for best fake boyfriend out there because Cas would probably get it. He lays it on thick, but it never comes off like he is. He sings Dean\u2019s praises and shares sly looks with Dean and touches him in all the ways that make Dean warm. Dean does his best to keep up, and with the way Cas keeps looking at him and the way Helen is looking at the two of them, he thinks he might actually be making this work.\nWhen the timer dings to say that the lasagne is fully cooked, Dean presses a hand to Cas\u2019 shoulder as he gets up.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got it,\u201d he says warmly. Then, to Helen, \u201cWe don\u2019t actually have a dining room table, or a dining room for that matter.\u201d He scratches the back of his neck awkwardly, \u201cWould you mind just eating here for tonight?\u201d\nHelen, who\u2019s already on her third glass of wine, says, \u201cOf course not, dear! Please, I\u2019m very eager to try it.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, then,\u201d Dean smiles, first at her, then at Cas. \u201cI\u2019ll bring it right out.\u201d And maybe it\u2019s because everyone is so eager to eat what he\u2019s made, or because he\u2019s just pretty happy in general right now, or because he\u2019s not thinking at all, but Dean leans down and pecks Cas on the lips, just because he thinks he should.\nThe press of lips is brief, chaste, hardly something inappropriate for current company. It\u2019s the exact kind of thing a \u201cnormal\u201d couple would do, Dean\u2019s almost positive. Of course, they\u2019re not normal. And Dean just kissed Cas. His throat tightens and his lips tingle and his face flushes. A moment of wordless communication passes between them, Cas\u2019 eyes wide and glued to his, mouth slightly parted, and Dean has to be the one to pull away before this starts to look weird. He escapes to the kitchen and grabs the lip of the counter, silently freaking out. Out in the living room, he hears the conversation start up again, haltingly on Cas\u2019 side.\nHe slumps against the counter, prepared to really flip out, and then another ding! from the impatient oven timer interrupts his thoughts. He scrambles to get it out before the cheese browns too much on top, and as he\u2019s doling pieces out onto the nicest plates they could find on short notice, he keeps thinking about Cas\u2019 lips on his own.\nWe\u2019re just playing the part, he tells himself feebly. He feels almost slightly nauseous, nerves ringing. Maybe he\u2019s been thinking about the something happening between them for so long he forgot what would actually get done once said something happened. All because he slipped up on a case.\nOh, fuck.\n\u201cLeo, you need any help in there?\u201d Cas calls, and Dean rolls his eyes at the pointed use of his fake name.\n\u201cI\u2019m good, thanks,\u201d he calls back, trying not to sound too choked as he takes a few deep breathes. He\u2019s fine. He\u2019s cool. He\u2019s collected. Partners kiss each other all the time, and him and Cas are supposed to be playing partners. Easy as that.\nPredictably, Cas ignores him. When Dean feels a soft hand on his waist, he almost upends three plates of lasagne onto Cas\u2019 torso, and only manages to right himself because Cas steadies him with an palm cupped around his elbow.\n\u201cShould I just start wearing a rain poncho all the time?\u201d Cas asks, teasing. Closer to Dean than he should be. \u201cFirst the paint, now this.\u201d\nDean pulls out of his grip. \u201cWhat do you think \u2018I\u2019m good, thanks\u2019 means?\u201d he hisses. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep holing up in here or she\u2019s gonna think it\u2019s weird.\u201d\nCas raises an astute eyebrow. He\u2019s not an idiot. He can read the embarrassment on Dean\u2019s face like his every emotion is spelled out in flashing lights above his head.\n\u201cI highly doubt a couple taking a moment\u2019s reprise from entertaining will send up any alarm bells, Dean.\u201d\n\u201cWhat happened to not lingering?\u201d\nCas gives him a look. \u201cI came in here to make sure you were\u2026 okay,\u201d he finishes, even though Dean suspects that\u2019s not the word he wanted to use.\nDean backs down, setting the plates of lasagne back on the counter.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he says awkwardly, folding his arms across his chest. \u201cSorry about that. I kind of sprung it on you. I wasn\u2019t thinking and-\u201d\nCas\u2019 face works through multiple expressions for a moment, finally seeming to settle on faintly amused. He puts a solid hand on Dean\u2019s arm. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, Dean,\u201d he assures him. Before Dean can say anything, Cas is right up in his space, putting his hands on either side of the counter, bracketing him. He leans forward, slotting his mouth against Dean\u2019s, sweet and warm and much less chaste than the last one. It takes Dean\u2019s brain maybe a second and a half to catch up with his lips, and then just as he\u2019s finally kissingCasbackholyshit Cas pulls away, smirking at him.\n\u201cNow we\u2019re even,\u201d he says archly, leaning around Dean to grab the salad bowl off the counter. Without another word, he brings it out into the living room.\nDean gives himself exactly ten seconds to punch the air and run a hand down his face, making sure it didn\u2019t just melt off or something and this isn\u2019t some kind of dying death wish dream. When his face doesn\u2019t fall to the floor, he grabs the lasagne and follows Cas back out to the living room, probably looking like he got run over by a truck full of Valentine\u2019s Day merchandise in the last couple minutes.\nDinner goes well, and Dean and Cas subtly continue to interrogate Helen, though by the time they\u2019ve all finished the bottle of wine and are happily cracking open a new one, she hardly needs any prodding to talk. Every once in a while she\u2019ll wince when Dean and Cas mention certain murders in the building over the years, but get absolutely no reaction at the mention of Connor Painter or the origins of the town.\nAt the end of the night, as they\u2019re carefully walking a somewhat unbalanced Helen to the door, she turns around to grasp each of their hands separately.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she slurs, \u201ct\u2019you so much. Y\u2019er both so\u2026\u201d she hiccups. \u201cDelightful.\u201d She grabs Cas\u2019 hand and grabs Dean\u2019s hand, and then puts them on top of each other. \u201cY\u2019love each other s\u2019much,\u201d she smiles, \u201cIt gives hope to t\u2019rest of us.\u201d She turns to go, using the doorframe to guide herself out into the hallway, and after a moment of stunned silence, Cas mumbles, \u201cI\u2019ll make sure she gets upstairs okay,\u201d, grabs the keys, and closes the door behind him.\nDean stares at the back of the door for a solid thirty seconds, before he robotically collects the plates from the living room table and brings them back into the kitchen. He scrubs them by hand instead of putting them into the dishwasher, needing something to do with his hands as his brain fizzes and pops, about as useless as a crumpled tissue.\nHe doesn\u2019t even register the sound of the apartment door opening, and then Cas is back, suddenly at his side and wordlessly drying the wet plates and silverware.\nDean can feel the tension mounting between them, like a storm about to break. Cas has been fairly non-chalant about this whole thing, but Dean kissing Cas by accident and then Cas kissing Dean and Dean kissing back? That\u2019s a whole other can of worms. Sure, Dean felt like he could lift an entire car over his head in the moments after said kiss, but that hardly translates to the real world. He has to keep reminding himself that none of this is real. That, yeah, maybe there\u2019s something between him and Cas, and that\u2019s okay, but acting on that something? That\u2019s dangerous. It\u2019s been fun playing house, and Dean\u2019s not dense enough to pretend that he doesn\u2019t like it, that he doesn\u2019t like it with Cas. But their reality is so far removed from this. He tried to bridge it with the speech about normal being relative, but it all suddenly feels like such bullshit he doesn\u2019t know what to do.\nThe longer the silence goes between them, the clumsier Dean\u2019s washing becomes. Eventually, Cas has to put the plate he\u2019s trying to dry down with a sigh.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an entire noodle still stuck to this plate,\u201d he says patiently to Dean.\nInstead of replying like a normal (there\u2019s that word again) person, Dean puts the knife he was just trying to clean down with a clatter, dropping his head and gripping the counter with both hands.\n\u201cThis is bad news, Cas,\u201d is all he can say. Despite his reasoning for putting an end to this being totally stalwart and true (it is, he\u2019s positive, because he doesn\u2019t know how to think about things any other way), it\u2019s also surprisingly hard to put into words. Maybe because there\u2019s a million reasons it would never work between them. Maybe because there\u2019s zero.\nDean\u2019s good with the flirting, with the unsaid stuff. Bad with the cliff these things are always, inevitably heading towards. That\u2019s why, initially, he didn\u2019t even want to take the case.\nHe tries not to think about how him and Cas sailed off that cliff a long long time ago, and are somehow still going.\nBeside him, Cas stills. He doesn\u2019t look at Dean, because suddenly this isn\u2019t a joke anymore. His jaw tenses, and he very slowly puts his plate down on the counter. He doesn\u2019t say anything, just walks out of the kitchen. The front door opens and shuts- it doesn\u2019t slam, it just shuts with the same click it always does- and Dean is standing alone in the apartment.\nFor thirty seconds he debates with himself, mostly repeating with Cas or without Cas because that\u2019s the best his brain can come up with at the moment. Once he decides with Cas, as if it were ever a question, he curses, grabbing their keys from the hook by the door and heading out into the hallway.\nHe\u2019s just about to head down the stairs and look for Cas in the parking lot, when he hears a shrill scream from somewhere above him. Hunter\u2019s instinct kicking in, he turns around and pounds up the stairs, following a second scream to the apartment in the corner of the fourth floor where he knows Helen lives.\n\u201cHelen!\u201d he shouts, throwing himself against the door. \u201cHelen, hang on!\u201d\nOn his third try, the door bursts open and he stumbles directly into the middle of a hurricane. Papers, tissues, glasses, even a chair are swirling around the room at a nauseous rate, wind blowing fast enough that Dean can barely catch a breath. In the middle of the chaos, Helen is slumped on the floor, arms covering her head. Dean runs to her, dodging the errant chair along the way. A couple pieces of paper catch him across the face, and he can feel them slice at his cheeks and forehead. Once he arrives at her side, he bends down, pressing a hand to her back. He tries to pull her up, to escape the room with her, but she\u2019s become dead weight, impossible to lift.\n\u201cHelen, c\u2019mon,\u201d Dean says loudly to her, \u201cYou gotta work with me here.\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t even think she can hear him with all the wind surrounding them, and Dean despairs as he searches the room urgently, trying to find some way of switching everything way off. In a shadowy corner of the room, he spies the same dark figure he saw in his and Cas\u2019 apartment earlier in the week, watching him malevolently. He\u2019s about to get up to try and grab salt, iron, anything that\u2019ll slow it down, but as he stands the chair that\u2019s still flying through the air changes direction completely and whirls towards him, forcing him to dive to the ground again to avoid being hit.\u00a0 Once he\u2019s on the ground, he has to roll out of the way as a set of steak knives aim for him, just barely missing them as they dig into the carpet next to him with loud thunks. The figure continues to stare at him, and it seems to bristle with indignation as it sends a couch cushion flying hard enough at Dean that he actually gets major airtime as he\u2019s knocked backward into the wall.\nAnd then, an iron bar is coming down fast and swift between the figure, forcing it to disassemble.\nEverything stops.\nPapers flutter back to the floor. Silverware falls with a thud and a clatter. The chair scrapes the tile in the kitchen.\nStanding where the figure just was is Cas, breathing hard, iron pipe from their apartment in hand. He scrambles over to Dean, putting one hand on his neck and the other on his shoulder.\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asks brusquely, searching Dean\u2019s face. Underneath the gruffness, Dean can hear the worry clear as day.\n\u201cM\u2019fine,\u201d Dean grumbles, shoving at the cushion where it\u2019s landed beside him. Other than having the breath knocked out of him and a face that stings, he actually is.\nCas gives him a hard look before retreating and checking on Helen, speaking to her in quiet tones. One step at a time, she unfurls, and soon Cas is leading her down the hall and into her bedroom.\nAs Cas obviously has The Talk with her- or a version of it, at least, since Dean has no idea what the deal with their cover is anymore- Dean attempts to clean up the apartment as best he can. He puts the chair rightside up again, reassembles the couch, slots the steak knives back into their block on the kitchen counter. He has no idea what to do about all the papers, and just ends up gathering them in one big pile and leaving them on the coffee table. Cas still isn\u2019t out of her room yet, so Dean paces up and down twiddling his thumbs.\nEventually, Cas emerges from the room with Helen, pale faced and twitchy, in tow.\n\u201cHelen is going to sleep in our apartment tonight,\u201d Cas informs Dean, and Dean just nods, grabbing her keys from the counter and following them back downstairs. Once they enter the apartment, Cas tries to lead Helen to their bedroom, but she pulls back. She\u2019s still obviously a little inebriated, but Dean knows that a tangle with a spirit like that goes a long way to sobering you up.\n\u201cI\u2019ll take the couch,\u201d she says, and when Cas looks like he\u2019s about to argue, she holds up a hand. \u201cPlease don\u2019t let me intrude on you anymore. I just need somewhere to rest.\u201d\nThey get her settled on the couch- which, surprise! Is a pull-out- and before they can even offer her a blanket, Helen has passed out on the mattress, obviously exhausted. Cas grabs a blanket from the Impala to lay over her, and according to him there were more than a couple tenants poking their heads out of their apartments on his way out and back.\nAs they settle into bed, Dean asks, \u201cD\u2019you think we should be worried? About the other tenants?\u201d\nCas shakes his head. \u201cThese recent attacks have been violent, but don\u2019t seem to occur in rapid succession. For tonight, everyone should be okay.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re running out of time for this,\u201d Dean says. \u201cWe gotta figure out what the hell to salt\u2019n\u2019burn and hurry.\u201d\n\u201cWe do,\u201d Cas says, and then rolls over, effectively ending the conversation. Dean knows a cold shoulder when he sees one. He lies there in the dark, staring at the ceiling. He\u2019s not thinking about this dumb fucking case. He\u2019s not thinking about what an actual, true blue domestic life would feel like. He\u2019s just thinking about Cas. Working cases with Cas, living in a house with a white picket fence with Cas, it doesn\u2019t matter. Only Cas does.\n\u201cI was going after you,\u201d he admits a couple minutes later. Cas doesn\u2019t roll back over, but Dean can see how the lines of his back go taught. \u201cI got side-tracked by our buddy with violent tendencies upstairs, but I was on my way to you,\u201d he says.\nCas very slowly rolls over to look at Dean in the dark.\n\u201cI was,\u201d Dean insists, though he knows Cas already believes him. He hesitates for a moment, then forces himself to swallow it as he cups a palm to Cas\u2019 cheek. Cas doesn\u2019t turn away, which is good. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have let you go all those months ago,\u201d he says. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have let you just walk out of the bunker.\u201d He lets out a breath. \u201cAnd tonight, I wasn\u2019t going to let you go. Not again.\u201d\n\u201cNot even if it\u2019s bad news?\u201d Cas asks, with somewhat of a wry undertone.\n\u201cFuck, Cas, honestly, I don\u2019t care what kind of news it is. I just want to read it.\u201d\nCas watches him for a long time without saying anything. Dean\u2019s head spins in about a thousand different directions, convinced that they\u2019re finally out of gas, they\u2019re going down.\nAnd then, almost casually, Cas says, \u201cFrankly, Dean, not having to hide my feelings for you has been very\u2026 refreshing.\u201d\nAnd then Dean says, \u201cWhat?\u201d\nAnd then Cas says, \u201cI love you,\u201d\nAnd then Dean says, \u201cWhat?\u201d and then stammers out, because he\u2019s a jackass sometimes, \u201clike\u2026 fake-boyfriends fake-love?\u201d\nAnd Cas glares at him and says, \u201cDon\u2019t play dumb.\u201d\nAnd Dean sighs, and processes that, and churns it through all the cogs in his brain. What said brain comes up with in response is, \u201cI love you, too. Like, not fake-wise. For real\u2026 sies.\u201d\nSometimes he\u2019s not so hot on the \u2018playing\u2019 part of playing dumb, but fuck it, he\u2019ll give himself a pass this time because it has been a crazy kinda day, week, year, life, etc.\n\u201cFor realsies,\u201d Cas says, and Dean knows he\u2019s never ever gonna hear the end of this one.\n\u201cYou can always focus on the other half of that sentence,\u201d he grumbles.\n\u201cOh, I am,\u201d Cas assures him, moving closer. Dean closes the distance between them, hesitantly at first, because there\u2019s no pretense this time, however thin. This isn\u2019t \u201cLeo\u201d and \u201cSteve\u201d kissing, it\u2019s Dean and Cas, and as Dean puts a hand on Cas\u2019 cheek, he can feel the difference.\nWhen they pull back to breathe, Dean can feel the awe on his face as he says, \u201cThis was probably a long time coming.\u201d\n\u201cThat is an astute observation, Dean,\u201d Cas says dryly before pulling him back in.\n\u201cHey, I mean it,\u201d he says, putting a hand on Cas\u2019 chest to hold him in place, because Cas can be pretty fucking single minded when he wants to be. Which is\u2026 well, which is pretty fucking great a lot of the time, but a pain in the ass at least a strong some of the time.\nCas has gotten better at talking about feelings and emotions and junk in the past months, but he\u2019s still the guy who preferred to dramatically flap off in the middle of a sentence when he decided he didn\u2019t like the way the conversation winds were blowing, and there are still shades of that in him (not that Dean\u2019s any better, really, but with his lack of wings, the most dramatically he can leave a conversation he doesn\u2019t like is by stomping loudly away and maybe slamming a door. Cas could literally whip himself away to the opposite side of the galaxy in no time if he didn\u2019t like how someone was dissing petunias or whatever).\nSo Dean gets it. Cas is very go big or go home. Guy comes from a family that tried to start the apocalypse because god\u2019s kids were all more sensitive than a stubbed toe and thought gullible was written on the ceiling even though they live in the sky. He gets it. Dean\u2019s been a slave to his own upbringing for literally his entire life.\nBut Cas also likes helping baby birds and sitting at the pond to watch the ducks swim around. He likes to watch Dean cook and steal bits and pieces when he thinks Dean isn\u2019t looking, even though he totally is, because his eyes have been glued to Cas since day one in that barn.\n\u201cLike\u2026 I feel like you should know I feel like I\u2019m gonna throw up right now,\u201d Dean says, ever the romantic. \u201cMy stomach is\u2026 I dunno. Fluttering? Like when you blink really fast and your eyelashes do the thing. That\u2019s how I feel\u2026 right now,\u201d he finishes lamely.\nCas looks at him for a couple seconds before saying a definitive, \u201cHm.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s always a good sound,\u201d Dean fires back, jittery.\n\u201cDo you know how long I\u2019ve loved you?\u201d Cas asks in return, \u201cBecause I don\u2019t,\u201d and Dean thinks, oh shit, we\u2019re going big, \u201cBut when I was an infinite, celestial being I had an almost-perfect grasp of time, down to the tiniest nanosecond. I knew exactly when the sun would set every night, and I knew when it would rise in the morning. I knew the moment the tide would start to recede from the shore. I could calculate the exact moment I found you in the pit, and the exact moment your head broke the surface after climbing out of your own grave in Pontiac, Illinois.\u201d He cocks his head slightly. \u201cBut I\u2019ll never be able to pinpoint the moment I fell in love with you.\u201d Beneath the covers, he grabs Dean\u2019s hand. \u201cEvery time I thought I\u2019d figured it out, I remembered a time before that, and then a time before that. Eventually I came to the conclusion that ever since we\u2019ve met, you\u2019ve been happening all around me. Happening to me. It\u2019s absurd to think a shell won\u2019t get wet if you drop it in the ocean. You\u2019re my ocean, Dean.\u201d\nDean blinks.\nThen he blinks again.\nThen he blinks one more time.\nHe takes a shaky breath, and he thinks he means to say something profound and inspiring, or at least acknowledge that the depth of his love for Cas is indescribable and infinite and something he feels in his very core, but this has been a very trying conversation and his higher brain functions are still processing pretty much everything that\u2019s happened in the past eight years between the two of them, so his brain to mouth filter is a little bit stuck when he says \u201cI still can\u2019t believe you made me crawl out of my own fucking grave.\u201d\nDean and Cas look at each other a lot, but there has been an excessive amount of looking lately and this conversation is no exception.\nCas looks at him, and looks at him, and looks at him some more. Almost like he\u2019s chewing on those words just as much as Dean has been chewing on his.\nFinally, he says, slightly exasperated as if Dean called him just as he\u2019s next in line at the grocery store to ask him to grab one more thing, \u201cI just pulled you from hell, Dean. Forgive me if my aim was shaky.\u201d\nDean actually chuckles.\n\u201cAn epic love story,\u201d he snorts, laughing into Cas\u2019 shoulder now, \u201cand my date couldn\u2019t even walk me to my front door.\u201d\nCas squeezes his hand, pressing his lips to the spot just below Dean\u2019s ear.\n\u201cTo be fair,\u201d he murmurs, \u201cYou didn\u2019t have a front door at the time. A front bumper, maybe.\u201d\nDean and Cas can\u2019t seem to do anything the normal way, so it\u2019s almost unsurprising when a yell and a crash from the living room interrupt their first makeout session ever, and Dean silently wonders as they stumble out of bed and towards their various weapons of choice if asshole ghosts ever get lessons in cockblocking.\nThey charge down the hall, tripping over their own feet and each other\u2019s, ghostbusters-lite to the max. There are more important things happening right now, but Dean really hopes his erection chills out. Last thing he wants is to fight an undead spirit while he\u2019s sporting a raging chubby.\nWhat he\u2019s not expecting is to see Sam standing in the middle of their living room, chanting in a language Dean\u2019s too distracted to decode, while the ghost of Connor Painter screams and writhes in the air, flames licking at his torso. Dean can just barely see Helen\u2019s blond head peeking over the couch as she cowers, hands over her head once more tonight. The room itself is in chaos, wind whipping around and the sigils painted behind the couch glowing fiercely, bright light eeking out from behind the cushions. Sam\u2019s hair is blowing into his face, obscuring his vision, but he reads on, shouting over the din. When he spots Dean and Cas across the room, his words falter for a moment as he takes a second to roll exasperated eyes, and then continues on smoothly.\nDean and Cas share a glance , wherein Dean says \u201cWhat the f-\u201d and Cas says, \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d and then Sam\u2019s chanting speeds up, along with the winds, but somehow he manages to keep his feet as Dean and Cas get sent flying into the nearest wall, one of Cas\u2019 flailing elbows accidentally sinking into Dean\u2019s stomach. Dean grunts, while Cas sends him an apologetic look.\n\u201cThis is what I love,\u201d Dean says flatly after regaining his breath. The room continues to flip into chaos in front of them. \u201cGetting magically stuck to walls. There is nothing I love more than getting magically stuck to walls like some kind of fly made out of super glue. It\u2019s not a hunt unless at least one Winchester has been magically stuck to at least one wall.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to elbow you in the stomach again,\u201d Cas says from beside him. \u201cOn purpose this time.\u201d\n\u201cTry me, pal. In case you\u2019ve forgotten, we\u2019re both magically stuck to a wall.\u201d\nThe room lights up in orange as the flames climb higher on Painter\u2019s body.\n\u201cI\u2019m very aware of our situation, Dean. As you just pointed out, we\u2019re both in the same boat.\u201d\n\u201cWell then good luck elbowing me, doofus.\u201d\nCas glares at him.\nIn the background, there\u2019s a ghostly howl from Painter.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t specify when, exactly, this elbow was going to happen.\u201d\nDean rolls his eyes. \u201cOh, big man. Talks the talk but can he walk the walk?\u201d\n\u201cIf this is you challenging me to a fight, Dean, I\u2019d tread carefully.\u201d He smirks. \u201cI\u2019m still winning, you know.\u201d\nA thrill shoots through Dean, and he quirks an eyebrow. \u201cWell, consider this me finally evening the score.\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds like someone who already thinks he\u2019s won,\u201d Cas mock-muses. \u201cBut last I checked, the \u2018gloves\u2019 have yet to come off.\u201d\nDean swallows. Okay, so maybe they weren\u2019t exactly talking about a good old gentlemanly round of fisticuffs. Cas got the hang of fingerquotes a long time ago so it\u2019s not like he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing.\n\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d Sam yells from across the room. The wind has died down enough that he can obviously hear their conversation.\n\u201cWe\u2019re magically stuck to a wall, Sam!\u201d Dean barks, his face hot, \u201cWhat the fuck do you expect us to do, play cards?\u201d\n\u201cYou could help with the hunt we\u2019re currently in the middle of,\u201d Sam snaps as he throws a handful of some kind of powder into a bowl. It bursts into a bright white cloud and Painter howls again.\n\u201cWhat do the words \u2018magically stuck to a wall\u2019 mean to you, Sam?\u201d Dean asks. \u201cBesides,\u201d he says dismissively, \u201cyou\u2019re doing just fine on your own.\u201d\nWith one final pinch of some kind of red powder, Sam sends Painter whirling into the kind of ghost-y black hole that one probably doesn\u2019t pull themselves out of without a considerable amount of effort and maybe a tank or two. The cacophony in the room dies down, and Dean and Cas thump to the floor as Painter\u2019s hold on them drops. Cas helps him up with an offered hand, his thumb lingering briefly on Dean\u2019s second knuckle.\nSam groans.\n\u201cI called both of you like fifty times, thinking you were dead or something, but no! No, instead you were so busy making moony eyes at each other you may as well have been in outer-fucking-space!\u201d\nDean sputters, red-faced, \u201cThat is not- that is- completely untrue and unfounded, if I do say so myself.\u201d He makes a face and elbows Cas, who immediately stands ramrod straight and says robotically, \u201cYes, that is untrue. Unfounded, even.\u201d\nSam glares between the two of them, muttering under his breath. It\u2019s not like Dean can give we were busy confessing our undying love for each other in the bed we were supposed to be fake-sharing as an excuse for not picking up his phone, so he leaves his pathetic non-alibi as is. Either way, it probably wouldn\u2019t do much to ease the bitchy look on Sam\u2019s face.\nA sound that could maybe be used to describe a very confused kitten occurs on the couch, and Dean and Cas both say, \u201cHelen,\u201d at the same time, and rush over, Sam right behind them.\nShe\u2019s sitting up now. Her hair looks like it went five rounds with a blender and lost, and there\u2019s still a trace of alcohol in the wide, deer-in-the-headlights way she\u2019s looking at them.\n\u201cUm,\u201d she says meekly, words rasping out of her throat, \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to get your security deposit back.\u201d\n\u00a0And then she falls forward, fainting into Sam\u2019s bewildered arms.\n***\n\u201cWait, I\u2019m sorry, I think you need to say that again.\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have to say it again if you had actually picked up your fucking phone.\u201d\n\u201cSam.\u201d\n\u201cDean.\u201d\n\u201cSam.\u201d\n\u201cDean.\u201d\n\u201cCas,\u201d Cas interjects flatly.\nDean throws up his hands in defeat. \u201cOkay, jesus! I should have picked up my phone. My fucking bad. Now can we talk about how you just sent an old ass ghost to fucking purgatory?\u201d He turns to Cas. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not allowed to watch Shrek anymore.\u201d\nSam blinks slowly at him.\n\u201cYou just spelled it out, like, right there. I sent a ghost to purgatory.\u201d\nDean\u2019s mouth twitches, and then he turns to Cas, who\u2019s perched on the other end of the bed Dean\u2019s sitting on. After finally calming Helen down properly and assuring her there would be no more indoor tornados tonight, they hightailed it back to Sam\u2019s hotel to debrief.\n\u201cYeah, but, do ghosts even go to purgatory after they flame out?\u201d Dean asks. He may have spent a year there, but Cas is still resident expert. \u201cI don\u2019t remember ever meeting a ghost there.\u201d\nCas shrugs one shoulder. \u201cWith all the stress put on the various dimensions in the last decade or so, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s possible. The lines are much blurrier than they used to be.\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure a salt\u2019n\u2019burn would be enough, honestly,\u201d Sam says. \u201cI found some copies of old letters written between Painter\u2019s enemies where they talked about ganging up on him, taking him out of the running for village center, and they seemed to agree that the best place to dump the body was in Otter Creek, which is the creek running right by your apartment building, by the way.\u201d He runs a hand through his hair. \u201cNo way we\u2019d ever find every last bit of him after all this time, even if the sediment at the bottom preserved him. Besides, I think by a quarter century later, burning his remains may not even work. He was pretty strong.\u201d\n\u201cHuh,\u201d Dean says. \u201cSo was it these dudes that killed him, then? And he\u2019s out for revenge or something?\u201d\n\u201cThat seems to be the case,\u201d Sam says. \u201cI assume he attacks anyone he thinks would be a threat.\u201d\nDean waggles his eyebrows at Cas.\n\u201cHear that, Cas? We\u2019re scary enough to threaten a 250-year old ghost. That\u2019s pretty badass.\u201d\n\u201cDean, I\u2019m much older than 250.\u201d\n\u201cUgh, which probably explains why you\u2019re such a buzzkill all the time, grandpa.\u201d\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t calling me grandpa when we were-\u201d\nSam clears his throat pointedly.\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t finish that sentence,\u201d he says.\n\u201cBut I was just going to say-\u201d\nSam holds up a hand.\n\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cSo wait,\u201d Dean says, \u201cWhy would he attack Helen, then? In her own apartment?\u201d\n\u201cGuilt by association, probably,\u201d Sam says. \u201cAccording to him, she was probably fraternizing with the enemy.\u201d His expression turns quizzical. \u201cWhich reminds me, why did you two have her over for supper?\u201d\nDean says \u201cuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\u201d for way too long, so Cas steps in.\n\u201cWe thought she was a suspect,\u201d he says, and Dean thinks, okay, so he\u2019s not going to- \u201cAnd also to prove to her that Dean and I were a legitimate couple, because we were worried we had slipped up.\u201d\nHe did.\nDean sighs, and Sam\u2019s visibly biting his lip to keep from laughing, all his previous ire forgotten.\n\u201cOh,\u201d he says, snorting, \u201cI\u2019m sure you two were very convincing.\u201d\n\u201cShut your face, Sasquatch,\u201d Dean says. \u201cAnd tell us how you figured all of this out. I thought you were having trouble finding records that old.\u201d\nApparently it\u2019s Sam\u2019s turn to go red, and Dean immediately prepares himself to rip on his favorite little brother.\n\u201cWell remember that librarian?\u201d Sam shakes his hair awkwardly, clearing his throat. \u201cFrom the library over in Sanex? She had some\u2026 uh\u2026 other pertinent info that she was willing to part with.\u201d He rubs the back of his neck, and Dean laughs in delight.\n\u201cSammy, you sly dog,\u201d he crows. He slaps Cas on the shoulder. \u201cLooks like we weren\u2019t the only ones shacking up this week, babe.\u201d\n\u201cEugh, Dean,\u201d Sam makes a face, obviously (hopefully) taking the joke as a joke, but completely missing the part where the pet name that just slipped out of his mouth was very much accidental and very much not part of the joke. He looks straight ahead, trying not to give himself away, but he can see Cas out of the corner of his eye staring at him, surprised. The surprise very quickly melts into affectionate amusement as Cas says, \u201cYes, Dean,\u201d very pointedly, \u201c\u2018Ugh.\u2019\u201d\nDean stands up. \u201cOkay, that\u2019s it,\u201d he declares, \u201cI\u2019ve had enough of this abuse. I\u2019m heading back to the apartment to clean up.\u201d\nSam\u2019s eyes practically bug out of his head.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to clean up after a hunt?\u201d he asks, aghast. \u201cIt\u2019s like I don\u2019t even know you.\u201d\n\u201cWe always clean up after a hunt you big dumb lug.\u201d\n\u201cBodies, yeah. Not overturned furniture.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll overturn you,\u201d Dean snaps, before grabbing his coat and heading for the door.\n\u201cAw,\u201d Sam says cutely, and Dean flips him off over his shoulder.\n***\n\u201cI\u2019m a suburban menace,\u201d Dean announces to the room at large, which currently only consists of Cas. \u201cI\u2019m a fucking domestic goddess.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not in the suburbs, and you missed a spot over there,\u201d Cas says mildly, pointing to the spot Dean did, in fact, miss.\nDean tsks loudly as he goes and sweeps the last of the dirt he missed. Where the hell Painter found dirt to scatter, Dean\u2019ll never know. \u201cHonestly, Cas, once a buzzkill, always a buzzkill.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe if you were better at sweeping I wouldn\u2019t be such a buzzkill,\u201d he says wryly.\n\u201cI\u2019ll fucking sweep you,\u201d Dean warns.\n\u00a0\u201cIs that a threat or a proposition?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll proposition\u2026 you\u2026 wait. Fuck. Disregard that sentence.\u201d\n\u201cI was quite curious as to where that was going, actually,\u201d Cas says archly. \u201cWe never got to finish our conversation earlier\u2026 you know. The conversation we were having. In bed. The conversation we had in the bed we were sharing.\u201d\n\u201cThe poison?\u201d Dean asks. \u201cThe poison for Kuzco?\u201d\nIt took them the better part of the night to put the apartment back in working order, but it looks almost as good as new. A bit of plaster where Dean\u2019s head dented the wall last night after he was magically stuck to it and a fresh coat of paint over all the sigils, and maybe, despite Helen\u2019s dire predictions, they can get their security deposit back.\u00a0\nThey\u2019ve worked in silence for the most part, but Dean\u2019s pretty sure they\u2019ve just been trading loaded glances when they don\u2019t think the other is looking.\nFinally, when they\u2019re done and the sky outside is gray with both impending morning and snow, they collapse side by side on the couch, knees knocking. Dean looks around their now clean apartment, satisfied, and drops an arm along the back of the couch.\n\u201cY\u2019know,\u201d he says, surveying the place. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t ours for long, but it was ours.\u201d\nWhen he glances over at Cas, Cas is staring right back at him, and it takes maybe a total of three seconds for Cas to fist his hands in the front of Dean\u2019s plaid, yanking him in and kissing him hot and heady. Dean feels like he just got launched into space, and scrabbles for purchase as he struggles to keep up, because Cas seems intent on taking him on the ride of his fucking life.\nBut because Dean Winchester is Dean Winchester, he feels the need to clarify that he\u2019s probably going to be one of the fuller luggage carts at the airport before he falls ass over teakettle into something he\u2019s never going to be able to unass or unteakettle.\n\u201cCas, wait, wait,\u201d he mushes against Cas\u2019 mouth, because Cas, apparently, is an eager beaver, both in his voracious approach to kissing and his apparent disinterest in caveats. He pulls back just barely, watching Dean with that classic Cas combo of exasperation and impatience.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat, Dean?\u201d he asks. Suddenly, his brows pull together and his voice goes a little unsure. \u201cDo you not want to do this?\u201d\nDean does a double take.\n\u201cWhat? Shit, no, Cas. I mean, yes! Yes, clearly I want to do this, holy shit. I thought I made that pretty obvious.\u201d\nCas\u2019 expression clears. \u201cThen let\u2019s get to it,\u201d he says promptly, leaning in again.\nDean literally puts an entire hand on Cas\u2019 face.\n\u201cListen up, Romeo,\u201d he says, \u201cI gotta say something first.\u201d\nCas makes such a disgruntled face that Dean almost laughs, but he knows this clarification is really important because if he didn\u2019t make it and Cas regretted it later he\u2019d be kicking his own ass into the stratosphere for it.\n\u201cPlease say what you need to say, Dean. I want to be kissing you.\u201d\nDean takes a deep breath and the plunge, \u201cOkay, like, look, I don\u2019t want to scare you away or whatever,\u201d and uh oh, here\u2019s Dean the party pooper, here to poop on all parties involved, \u201cI just need you to know, like, that shit you said to me last night?\u201d He raises his eyebrows, as if that\u2019s all the road signs Cas needs, \u201cI\u2019ll never be able to. I dunno. Express myself like that. You said it like a fucking magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat, and I just can\u2019t do that. I can\u2019t be that. I\u2019m not\u2026 Flowery. Or pretty. Or even nice, half the time.\u201d\nCas pulls back just slightly.\n\u201cOh,\u201d he says dryly. \u201cWell, in that case, I guess I\u2019m calling this whole thing off.\u201d He sits back on his haunches, resting his hands on his thighs as if to say, well, I tried. \u201cGuess I\u2019ll go pull someone else out of hell and start another epic love story with them, then.\u201d He puts a finger on his chin, mock-thinking. \u201cMaybe an English teacher this time? Someone good with words.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYou are such a sarcastic little asshole.\u201d\nCas kisses him again, softer this time.\n\u201cYou need to stop with the qualifiers,\u201d he instructs quietly. \u201cI\u2019ve known you for so long, Dean. You may still believe them, but I never have and I never will and there is literally nothing you can say at this point to \u2018scare me away\u2019.\u201d His mouth quirks, \u201cThough, for the record, you are very pretty.\u201d\nDean leans forward this time, capturing Cas\u2019 mouth with his own.\n\u201cI can give you all I got, Cas,\u201d he promises. \u201cI dunno if it\u2019ll be enough.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019ll always be enough,\u201d Cas assures him, lifting a hand to fit Dean\u2019s cheek. His thumb traces gently over the seam of Dean\u2019s lips, and Dean opens his mouth slightly, pressing a kiss there. Cas\u2019 whole expression softens, and when he kisses Dean again, it\u2019s like the tide has gone out again, the heat ebbing, but the ocean remains as vast, as wide, as deep as it always has been and always will be.\n***\nThe tide comes in eventually. It is a cyclical phenomenon, after all.\nCas works his fingers into Dean right there on their comes-with-the-place couch (that twenty minute interlude where they practically sprinted to the drug store down the road to buy lube maybe wasn\u2019t the most subtle, but it was the quickest way to penetration town, and Dean\u2019s fucking glad his GPS doesn\u2019t have to recalculate a route) and Dean keens into it, barely able to form coherent thoughts, let alone a sentence.\n\u201cSo, does fake-fingering you mean I get to fake-fuck you?\u201d Cas asks, voice still wry but Dean can see how quick his breathing has gotten. Cas may be Mr. Smooth, but sticking your fingers into a dude\u2019s ass for the first time would probably be an overwhelming sensation for pretty much anyone.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u201cYou can fake-do whatever you want to me, Cas, just do it now.\u201d\nCas\u2019 fingers still in Dean, and just when Dean\u2019s about to crack open an eye and ask what the hell, he finds Cas staring at him so reverently that his body has to work double time just to get enough blood back to his face so he can flush.\n\u201cI think I\u2019d like to do it for real,\u201d Cas says quietly, leaning his forehead against Dean\u2019s.\nDean swallows. \u201cIt\u2019s always been real,\u201d he says. Of course it has. They\u2019d just been fucking around before, but dropping the joke sharpens the reality of this, of them.\nCas pulls back to search Dean\u2019s face, and almost seemingly unconsciously starts to slowly work in Dean again. This is an incredibly important moment, and Dean\u2019s definitely going to remember this forever, but it\u2019s awfully hard to concentrate when Cas\u2019 fingers idly brush over his prostate and an involuntary whine is pulled from him like a parachute\u2019s rip cord. Cas\u2019 eyes snap back to his at the sound, and his face suddenly splits into a grin so wide it cracks open a similarly sized crevice in Dean\u2019s chest. He surges forward to seal his mouth to Dean\u2019s, fingers working with a renewed fervor. He carefully inserts a third finger, and Dean hisses through the burn, then relaxes into it.\n\u201cThat was definitely real,\u201d Cas murmurs into his ear, laughing into the crevice between Dean\u2019s neck and shoulder.\n\u201cGuess the jig is up,\u201d Dean says breathlessly. Then, just because he can, \u201cYou got me, darlin\u2019.\u201d\nCas shudders on top of him, leaving a hot trail of kisses down the side of Dean\u2019s neck as he readjusts Dean\u2019s leg where it lays over the top of the couch, hefting it over his shoulder- \u201cCareful, Cas, jesus. I\u2019m not a rag doll. People don\u2019t bend that way.\u201d- His other leg is dangling off the couch, foot pressed flat to the floor to get the best leverage possible so he can fuck himself back onto Cas\u2019 fingers.\n\u201cI feel bad about this couch,\u201d Cas says idly as Dean writhes beneath him.\n\u201cDo you-ah- really?\u201d Dean asks, voice catching when Cas twists his fingers just so.\nCas smirks.\n\u201cNo.\u201d He reconsiders. \u201cAlthough we probably could have put down a blanket, at least.\u201d\n\u201cGlad someone\u2019s thinking about the- nnnngh- practical things.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised, Dean Winchester,\u201d Cas says mischievously. \u201cMy mind works in mysterious ways. For instance, I\u2019m currently thinking about the way you look beneath me, flushed from head to toe and completely unabashed, and I salivate at the thought of what\u2019s to come-\u201d\n\u201cWho the fuck told you that you could talk like that?\u201d\n\u201cBut I\u2019m also thinking about your hands, and your eyes, and your back, and your kneecaps.\u201d He kisses Dean lightly, chastely. \u201cYour lips. Your freckles. Your toes and your ears and your knuckles and your stomach.\u201d He kisses Dean again, quirking his fingers until he finds Dean\u2019s prostate for a second time and massages it with the pad of his finger. Stars burst in front of Dean\u2019s eyes and he whimpers, lit up from the inside like a Christmas tree. Tears form at the corner of his eyes, hot and itchy and overwhelming. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about how much every part of you means to every part of me, and I am\u2026\u201d he kisses Dean for a third time, long and languid and slow, and Dean\u2019s gut simmers, revelling.\u00a0 \u201cWell, I\u2019m speechless.\u201d\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Dean teases. \u201cTell that to the dictionary you just-\u201d Cas\u2019 fingers slide slowly out of Dean, and the empty feeling they leave behind isn\u2019t a pleasant one. \u201cHey! I wasn\u2019t done with those.\u201d\nCas raises an eyebrow at him.\n\u201cI was thinking we could replace those with something a little more\u2026 substantial,\u201d Cas offers suggestively. His brow furrows as he shakes the hand that was just inside Dean, holding his wrist with a grimace. \u201cAnd an appendage less susceptible to cramping,\u201d he adds, frowning at his own hand. Dean watches the way the early morning light glints off Cas\u2019 still-lubed up fingers and thinks, holy shit those were just inside me.\nHe can feel Cas\u2019 dick, hard and leaking where it presses insistently into his hip, and he has to swallow a large, sudden excess of saliva as his mouth starts to water. He was so distracted by Cas\u2019 fingers that he didn\u2019t even bother thinking about the second course, and now that it\u2019s here staring him in the face he finds he\u2019s more than ready, finds that his empty ass literally aches for something to clench against. He drags his hands up and down Cas\u2019 naked back, hoping that\u2019s encouragement enough for him to continue. Instead, Cas leans forward, pressing their mouths together again, hot and insistent and wet.\n\u201cTell me,\u201d he orders softly. \u201cTell me what you want.\u201d\nDean rolls his eyes. \u201cYeah, Cas, shit, put the thing in the thing.\u201d\nCas pulls back and eyes him.\n\u201cI am going to insert my penis into your rear end now, Dean Winchester.\u201d\n\u201cShut up, smartass. And don\u2019t forget the lube.\u201d\nCas slicks himself up, and when Dean offers a hand, Cas bats him away.\n\u201cI think it may be better if I do it,\u201d Cas informs him in the tone of voice that is supposed to convey complete composure, but instead conveys complete internal upheaval. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll last if you do it.\u201d\nDean looks down at his own aching dick, leaking precome at the head, and says, \u201cYou may have a point there. Maybe we should have saved the triple X stuff for romp numbers two through infinity.\u201d\nOoh, infinity. Now there\u2019s a scary word. Less scary when applied to Cas, though.\nCas sits back on his haunches, slick dick bobbing, aching at the ready. Dean feels like he\u2019s being saluted.\n\u201cYou want to wait?\u201d Cas asks, and the thing is, Dean knows he would. If he called red-light on this whole sexcapade right now, Cas would probably just nod in complete understanding and jerk himself off, kissing Dean when he finished for being such a good sport.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I said,\u201d Dean clarifies. \u201cI really want you to stick your penis into my rear end, Castiel.\u201d\n\u201cMy fake-penis into your fake-rear end?\u201d\n\u201cYour real dick into my real asshole.\u201d\nSo Cas goes ahead and does exactly that. He holds Dean\u2019s hand through it and whispers encouragement into his ear, and somehow they both manage to last a not-so-respectable couple minutes, probably because the initial discomfort manages to deflate the roaring arousal in Dean\u2019s stomach at least a bit, and Cas is so focused on not hurting Dean that he almost forgets to tell Dean exactly how good he feels, wrapped up in him. Cas repeats something about the ocean, and those tears that were threatening finally fall in quick, twin falls down the side of Dean\u2019s face.\nCas puts his hands on either side of Dean\u2019s face and says, \u201cI love you,\u201d and Dean manages to choke out a very undignified \u201cI love you too,\u201d right back, because he really really does.\n***\nAs they drive home to Kansas, security deposit in hand and Helen\u2019s \u201cfor emergencies\u201d cell number in their pockets, Dean watches Sam in the passenger seat pull out his wallet, grab a twenty, pass it to his other hand, then put it back in his wallet with a small, satisfied smirk.\nHe glances in the rear view mirror, but Cas is still conked out in the backseat, unable to offer any insights.\n\u201cWhat was that,\u201d he asks Sam warily, keeping his eyes on the road.\nSam shrugs the most unconvincing shrug Dean\u2019s ever seen, and he once had Sam try to deny there was an iPod jack in his car while he was literally staring at an iPod jack in his car, put there by Sam.\n\u201cSam, why did you just do that,\u201d he pushes.\n\u201cDo what?\u201d Sam asks innocently. He\u2019s just playing with Dean now.\n\u201cSam so help me god-\u201d\n\u201cI was just cashing in on a bet,\u201d Sam interrupts, the smirk doing its best to slide back onto his face. Sam fights valiantly, though.\n\u201cA bet? With\u2026 yourself?\u201d\n\u201cUh huh.\u201d And there\u2019s the smirk.\n\u201cPray tell what was this bet.\u201d\nSam\u2019s eyes flick up to the rear view mirror and then back.\n\u201cHonestly,\u201d he says, laughter in his voice, \u201cYou two are so transparent you may as well be cling wrap.\u201d\nDean could say a lot of things in response.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he says instead.\nSam gives him a very dramatic look.\n\u201cDean, there were a million other ways we could have tackled this case,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you and Cas somehow talked yourselves into the most unlikely cover by posing as a couple. And then you took like ten times longer than normal to solve a simple salt and burn. And I\u2019m also pretty sure you completely forgot I was working the case. And maybe you forgot there was a case, period.\u201d\n\u201cWell, shit, Sam, you\u2019re just making me sound like one goddam great hunter right now.\u201d\n\u201cYou are a great hunter.\u201d Sam smirks. \u201cAnd also, I just won twenty bucks from myself.\u201d\n***\nThe Official (Totally Not Fake) Epic Love Story of Dean and Castiel started on September 18th, 2008, though it wasn\u2019t named as such until more than eight years later on the way to a dumb hunt in a small city in Vermont. They bickered over the name and they bickered over what details to change and what details to keep in. They snapped at each other over bad suggestions and got way too into the backstory for a case that barely required a frontstory, but since they\u2019re Dean and Cas, they did it the goddam hardest way.\nThey barely knew what they were doing, stumbling into something they\u2019d been stumbling into for the past eight years. They said the wrong things and touched at inappropriate times and forgot important details they should have remembered, pretty much like any normal couple does. They painted sigils on bedroom walls and hid hexbags in apartments that weren\u2019t theirs and sent a 250 year old ghost packing to purgatory, pretty much not like any normal couple.\nThey had no idea what they were doing, because if they\u2019re being honest, they\u2019ve never known what they\u2019re doing. No one stumbles on purpose, but at least they ended up stumbling into each other.\nFrom the beginning, this whole thing was a crapshoot, a gambit, a roll of the dice. They had no idea what they would roll, but they rolled, regardless. Took a chance and a plunge directly into unknown waters.\nYou could probably say they were making it up as they go.\u00a0\n\u00a0"
