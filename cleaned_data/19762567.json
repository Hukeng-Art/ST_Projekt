(New Vegas for life). Then after writing it I realized I'd written Shigaraki liking a game where (SPOILERS) the central plot twist is that the villain is a child who was ripped away from his family and raised to lead a sinister villainous organization... and then I made myself sad.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_2_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>i didn't give natsu much focus in my todofam month fics and he deserves better, so he's the star of the show here. it's important that you all know that natsuo is taller than every single league member with a canon height. also he is indeed a med student! he studies medical welfare. i know he's canonically heat-sensitive but i still really like the hc of him being quirkless.</p>\n<p>korusukan-ku is named after coruscant, of course, following in horikoshi's proud tradition of naming everything after star wars places (see: musutafu, kamino, hosu). yes, storming tartarus is a reference to the area 51 raid, what a time to be alive.</p>\n<p>ALSO my good pal <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/users/Saccha/pseuds/Saccha\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sacchari</a> decided to write the <b>VERY NSFW</b> <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cjOM6SVYR-qSt4V3f2I7Ny6o2Z__EgcYqXrCiauDskQ/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">thirsty tweets</a> from the video at the start of this episode. i would disintegrate my phone too. </p>\n<p>the response to every story in this universe has been absolutely mind blowing, thank you guys so much. i definitely have more stories i want to tell in this series- i want to do something following up on the deku bit at the end of this story, something focusing on a certain winged someone who's spent the story so far desperately trying to avoid getting caught in the league's videos, and, of course, more hero theory, as well as maybe others. </p>\n<p>i can't promise when any of those will be finished, since i'm currently very busy and i like to take my time on these stories, and they take longer since each is more or less self-contained, because i don't want to ever leave you guys hanging, but i definitely want to write them.</p>\n<p>&lt;3 love you, folks!</p>",
    "text": "It starts with Toga\u2019s sneak-uploaded response video to a certain theorist channel publishing a theory on Dabi\u2019s true identity as Touya Todoroki. The video is about thirty seconds long, shaky and handheld, and consists of Dabi screaming obscenities and ranting against both his father and brother, blue sparks raining from his fists, as Shigaraki cackles hysterically offscreen.\nDespite being flagged and removed multiple times, it garners a total of upwards of five million views in the first twenty-four hours.\nNow, of course, that could have been the end of it, with the League of Villains subsiding back into the shadows of their notoriety, existing only as a threatening phantom in the public consciousness. It could have been. But Himiko Toga is a person who loves two things very much: her friends\u2026 and attention.\nSo, perhaps unsurprisingly, that isn\u2019t the end of it at all. It\u2019s just the beginning.\nThe first channel pops up around ten days after the Dabi/Touya debacle. It has a blank icon, and is just called Himi and her Friends :). The first video, uploaded shortly after the channel creation, is as follows.\n\u00a0---\nThe video opens on a slightly shaky shot of what looks like a rundown, nondescript basement. In the distance, voices can be heard yelling indistinctly, as well as the undertones of what sounds like a television in the background.\nThe camera flips around briefly to show Toga, who puts a shhh finger to her lips, before flipping back around and approaching a nearby doorway. As it draws nearer, the voices (it becomes evident that there are three, all overlapping) become both louder and clearer, allowing the viewers to catch snippets.\n\n\u201c-no, listen, you are so full of shit-\u201d\n\n\n\u201c-just won\u2019t admit that you\u2019re wrong-\u201d\n\n\n\u201c-fucking fight you-\u201d\n\n\n\u201c-can you both just shut up-\u201d\n\nThe camera reaches the door, a scene coming into view: Shigaraki and Spinner glaring each other down, shouting at each other. Dabi is standing between them, a hand twisted up in each of their collars, physically holding them apart. He looks somewhere between furious and exasperated, smoke rising from the seams in his wrists. It is evident that none of them know they are being filmed.\n\u201cFallout Four is not better than New Vegas!\u201d Spinner shouts. \u201cYou\u2019re- wrong! You\u2019re just wrong!\u201d\n\u201cNew Vegas doesn\u2019t even have a plot, you\u2019re just wandering around the desert!\u201d Shigaraki yells back. \u201cFallout Four has story!\u201d\n\u201cNew Vegas lets you choose your own adventure and actually affect the wasteland! What\u2019s the point of \u2018story\u2019 if it\u2019s just Finding Nemo but sadder!\u201d\n\u201cOh, what, do plot twists make you cry, you little baby?\u201d\n\u201cCry with boredom, maybe! I saw it coming a mile away!\u201d\nThe camera pans briefly over to the television- a paused game of Fallout 4 is on the screen- before moving back to the fight.\n\u201cYou\u2019re so full of shit,\u201d Shigaraki snaps. \u201cAt least my game isn\u2019t buggy as shit-\u201d\n\u201cThey were on a deadline!\u201d Spinner cuts him off. \u201cAnd the game is even more impressive for the limits they had to work with!\u201d\nDabi groans. \u201cAre you two done yet?\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d the two bickering parties yell at approximately the same time, before glaring at each other even more fiercely.\nDabi rolls his eyes, hard, and in doing so catches sight of the camera- he focuses on it, eyes widening before narrowing abruptly. \u201cToga, you better not be-\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s she- oh, shit,\u201d Spinner says, twisting around to catch sight of what Dabi is looking at. Dabi releases both of the shirts he\u2019d been holding, clenching his fists, and then the picture disappears into a blur of darkness as the filmographer makes a hasty escape, her giggles audible in the background.\n\u00a0---\nFallout 4 vs. Fallout New Vegas: League of Villains Debate\n19,787 views\n\nComments \u2022 133\n\nAmmi\nIs this.

The shot is at a diagonal angle, as though whoever is taking it is trying not to look like they\u2019re filming. On the table is a half-built pyramid constructed of shotglasses and playing cards. Spinner and Mr. Compress are hovering over it, the latter unmasked except for his balaclava, as Compress neatly lays a layer of playing cards over the mouths of the top layer of glasses.\n\u201cOkay, for real though,\u201d Spinner is saying. \u201cWhy do you carry those around everywhere?\u201d\nCompress smiles cryptically. \u201cYou never know when they might come in handy.\u201d\n\u201cSure, but are there really that many situations where they\u2019re handy?\u201d Spinner persists. \u201cThis is like the third deck. When would you need three decks of cards?\u201d\n\u201cA magician never reveals his secrets,\u201d Compress says, unruffled, as he places a new shot glass in the center of the next layer of the pyramid.\n\u201cThis is boring,\u201d Dabi\u2019s voice calls, and the camera jerks over to where he\u2019s seated a few feet away, watching with a supremely bored expression, head propped up on one hand. \u201cFill the glasses, cowards.\u201d\nCompress raises his eyebrows (probably- it\u2019s difficult to tell behind the mask). \u201cIs that a challenge?\u201d\n\u201cSo what if it is?\u201d Dabi saids, grinning.\nCompress is silent for a moment before turning towards the direction of the camera. \u201cToga, be a darling and go grab me the whiskey.\u201d\n\u00a0---\nTen Foot Tall Shotglass Tower TOPPLES\n54,081 views\nBert Bally\ngod this just gets funnier the longer it goes on\n\u6c34\u306e\u4e2d\nOn one hand I feel bad about all the wasted work Compress put in but on the other hand there\u2019s no way he didn\u2019t set that up to fall exactly the way it did\nWen Were\n7:02 when Dabi started sparking and everyone started screaming because of all the flammable alcohol everywhere\u2026 fdgfhdgsfhj\nMay Juugo\nWHY DO THESE VIDEOS KEEP GETTING TAKEN DOWN I JUST WANT TO WATCH WANTED CRIMINALS BE IDIOTS\n\u00a0---\n\u201cToga.\u201d\nToga considers her options. Shigaraki is using the Leader Voice (it was a work in progress, but had reached about a fifty percent success rate). That means whatever it is is probably serious, and furthermore, she will not be able to dodge out of this conversation.\n\u201cYe-essssss?\u201d she says slowly, hands tangling together behind her back.\nShe\u2019s pretty sure she has an idea of what it was about, but that won\u2019t stop her playing dumb for as long as was humanly possible.\nShigaraki stares her down. She stares back, yellow eyes big and innocent.\n\u201cYou need to stop posting those videos.\u201d\nToga\u2019s face crumples into an expression of anguish. \u201cBut they\u2019re so fun! And they\u2019re not hurting anyone!\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re hurting our image,\u201d Shigaraki says emphatically. \u201cThey\u2019re making us into a laughingstock.\u201d\n\u201cActually,\u201d Compress speaks up suddenly (Toga wonders briefly when he entered the room before deciding not to question it), \u201cI disagree. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve been reading the comments-\u201d\n\u201cOf course I\u2019ve been reading the comments, what do you take me for,\u201d Shigaraki mutters.\n\u201c-but people like the videos,\u201d Compress continues, unfazed by the interruption. \u201cMore importantly, though, they like us. The videos make us more relatable. More likable. Which means people are more likely to listen to our message.\u201d\nShigaraki makes a considering face. \u201cSo you mean-\u201d\n\u201cBefore, we launched Noumu attacks downtown to get attention. To get an audience,\u201d Compress presses. \u201cBut with the videos, we can accomplish the same thing much more successfully and, if I may say, at a much lower cost. It\u2019s just basic showmanship.\u201d\n\u201cBut people are laughing at us,\u201d Shigaraki protests.\n\u201cBecause they like us!\u201d Toga chimes in again. \u201cThey think we\u2019re fun! And funny! That\u2019s a good thing!\u201d\nShigaraki inhales, and sits in silence for a long moment. Toga opens her mouth to continue, but Compress shoots her a warning look (or at least, she thinks he does) before she can.\n\u201cFine,\u201d Shigaraki finally says. \u201cBut from now on you\u2019ll run all the videos past me before you post them to make sure they don\u2019t give anything away. You\u2019re also going to give the whole League the login, so anyone can post videos. If we\u2019re doing this we might as well make it official. I\u2019m going to make one explaining our manifesto.\u201d\nToga blinks. \u201cWe have a manifesto?\u201d\n\u00a0---\nLeague of Villains: Mission Statement\n201,081 views\n\nComments \u2022 591\n\n\u4e0b\u3055\u3044\nthis video is like 10% about the actual lov and 90% railing against stain\nAnnagramma\nBetween this and Hero Theory, it kinda looks like the heroes vs villains fight is going digital. Does this mean we can stop rebuilding downtown every other week??\nYuu Masaki\nOKAY IM JUST GONNA SAY IT\nHAND DUDES FACE ISNT HALF BAD WITHOUT THE DISEMBODIED LIMBS\nJo Journey\nAsgdgd i love how you can tell the rest of the league are like. just BARELY offscreen\n\u00a0---\n\u201cJust tell me,\u201d Tsukauchi says, briefly pinching the bridge of his nose, \u201cis there anything in the video that we can actually use?\u201d\n\u201c...no,\u201d Officer Yamato says reluctantly. \u201cIt was filmed in an empty warehouse, and it seems to have been checked for any locational giveaways beforehand. It could have been anywhere in the city. It might not even be in this prefecture.\u201d\n\u201cI see,\u201d Tsukauchi mutters wearily.\n\u201cDr. Matamoto is having a field day, though,\u201d Yamato offers after a moment, nodding over at their department\u2019s resident criminal psychologist, who is scribbling in a notebook with the latest video paused on her computer screen.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure she is.\u201d Tsukauchi shakes his head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense. They\u2019re more than a month now into a lull with no major criminal activity connected to them, ever since the last noumu incident. And it\u2019s not like they\u2019re releasing hostage videos or anything of the sort. They\u2019re practically a comedy channel. Even this \u2018manifesto\u2019 has giggling audible in the background.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Yamato says slowly, \u201cit\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s better than them doing crime? Right?\u201d\nTsukauchi throws his hands up. \u201cI mean, I guess!\u201d\n\u00a0---\n\u201cIs it filming? Toga, is it filming? There\u2019s no little red light.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s filming! It\u2019s filming! Wait. No, it\u2019s not. Wait.\u201d\n\u201cI knew it.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, now I\u2019m sure it\u2019s filming. Anyways, whenever you\u2019re ready!\u201d\nThe video is slightly grainy from lack of light, the only source of illumination a bare light bulb somewhere off screen, and focuses on Spinner, who is sitting on a ratty couch with a low table covered in cloth. He grins at the camera.\n\u201cHello, YouTube! I\u2019m Spinner, of the League of Villains. And today I\u2019m gonna- uh, Toga, drumroll, please?\u201d\nThere\u2019s the sound of someone somewhat clumsily drumming on a concrete wall before Spinner jerks the cloth off of the table with a flourish. Revealed is a spread of various sharp and shiny things, mostly knives with the occasional sword or shuriken.\n\u201cToday, I\u2019m gonna review some of my knife collection, for any fellow enthusiasts out there!\u201d\n\u00a0---\nReviewing My Knives (Part 1)\n67,232 views\nLion King\nis he in cosplay?\nYoroshika\nMan I just realized when the league finally gets taken down we\u2019ll lose this stream of absolute comedy gold\u2026 any chance we can lobby the heroes to let them have cameras in jail?\nEna Matsu\nBruh a genuine traditional wakizashi??

Spinner reviews weapons and extols Stain\u2019s ideology. Toga films everything from prank videos to stolen makeup reviews (she favors bright red) to slightly ominous videos taken in public places, zooming in on random faces and giggling. Twice vlogs, and is terrible at it.\nCompress tends to upload cryptic videos, full of strange imagery, either silent or with garbled, distorted audio. Shigaraki is like, ninety percent sure he\u2019s running an ARG. At least it seems to be keeping him busy.\nThe only one who hasn\u2019t apparently taken to it is Dabi- Touya, who\u2019s still sulking about getting outed in Toga\u2019s very first video. He\u2019s also angry they\u2019ve all but stopped using his dumb alias in the videos, but it\u2019s his own fault for lying to them, in Shigaraki\u2019s humble opinion.\n\u00a0---\nLeague Youtube Tracker @LOVTracker\nNew video!

A few miles away, the employees of a chain grocery store are going to be very surprised when they arrive at work in the morning and find the sliding glass doors have been reduced to dust.)\n\u201cWhat- how is it my fault?\u201d Shigaraki objects, voice pitching up with indignant fury.\n\u201cYou could\u2019ve stopped Toga way before this got so out of hand, is all I\u2019m saying,\u201d Dabi says.\n\u201cYou think I can stop her when she has her mind set on something?\u201d Shigaraki asks with a roll of his eyes. \u201cBesides. She wasn\u2019t completely wrong. We have a fanbase now.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what, that\u2019s a good thing? People watching us all the time?\u201d\n\u201cOh, what, is Mr. Fights the Number One Hero on Live TV scared of a little publicity?\u201d\n\u201cFirst of all, I\u2019m not scared of shit. I\u2019m just saying, the Internet\u2019s fucked us over before.\u201d\n\u201cUh, no,\u201d Shigaraki says, shifting the jug of orange juice to his other arm so he can point at Dabi. \u201cThe Internet fucked you over, Touya, and that was because of your own brother more than, like, anything else.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t remind me,\u201d Dabi groans, head falling back so he can glare up at the smoggy sky. \u201cPeople keep commenting telling me to call my mom.\u201d\n\u201cThen call her, dipshit,\u201d Shigaraki says, kicking a pebble a few feet down the alley. \u201cOr stop whining about it.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not whining.\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d Shigaraki says, and rolls his eyes again, even harder. The effort is sadly wasted, though, since Dabi isn\u2019t even looking at him, the asshole. \u201cHey, speaking of him and his, uh, sparkplug friend. If we keep doing this, you know, we\u2019ll probably beat them for followers eventually.\u201d\n\u201cNot if our channel gets getting deleted every fucking week,\u201d Dabi says, but he\u2019s obviously interested. Hah. Shigaraki absolutely has his number.\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not getting a following,\u201d Shigaraki says. \u201cThat only means more and more people are paying attention to us. What you have to understand, Touya, is that all publicity is good publicity.\u201d\n\u00a0---\nHero Theory Episode 37: Is Shigaraki Tomura Related to Shimura Nana?\n967,771 views\n\nComments \u2022 2,072\n\nAddie Bowie\nOh my god??

He mouths \u2018karma\u2019 with a wide grin, then flips the camera around.\nShigaraki can be seen sitting on the bare concrete floor, staring blankly into the middle distance. There\u2019s a half-melted phone lying beside him, and the floor and walls all around him bear the tell-tale signs of someone with a five-point disintegration quirk having an emotional meltdown. The hands are nowhere to be seen.\n\u201cHey!\u201d Dabi calls from behind the phone. \u201cHow\u2019s it going over there, Tenko?\u201d\nWithout hesitation, Shigaraki snatches up the half-disintegrated phone and hurls it directly at him. The camera abruptly jolts downwards as Dabi ducks, still cackling to himself.\n\u201cShut the fuck up, Touya!\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely fucking not!\u201d Dabi shouts back gleefully. \u201cThis is the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to me. I\u2019ve had to put up with this bullshit for months. Now it\u2019s your turn.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, I gotta ask,\u201d a voice says from offscreen, and the camera pans around to focus on Twice. Toga is beside him, perched on the arm of the sofa. \u201cDoes anybody else here have secret hero parentage we should probably know about? I only ask cause, like, we\u2019re already two for two, so like-\u201d\n\u201cI have some hero blood in me, does that count?\u201d Toga offers.\nTwice appears to consider it. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, dude.\u201d\n\u201cBoth of you shut up!\u201d Shigaraki screams, and the room quiets.\n\u201cRight,\u201d Toga stage-whispers to the camera. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be quiet while Shiggy has his existential crisis.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d Shigaraki grinds out, \u201ca crisis. I\u2019m just. Thinking.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been thinking for a long time,\u201d Spinner\u2019s voice says from somewhere out of frame. \u201cIt\u2019s been like three hours now. You sure you\u2019re-\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d Shigaraki screeches, sounding the furthest thing from fine.\nDabi says, with obvious glee, \u201cThis is the best thing Shouto has ever done for me.\u201d\n\u00a0---\nshigaraki in crisis lmao\n292,083 views\n\nComments \u2022\u00a0723\n\nMieru\nplease tell me the hero theory kids have seen this\nChristmas Lights\nI can\u2019t believe *this* is the first video Dabi ever posted- wait, no, I absolutely believe it.\nJA Stein\nis he okay???????\nCortizone\nI cannot BELIEVE\n\u00a0---\nAdelaide Bowie @bowieb1\n@AllMightOfficial have you seen this????? https://bit.ly/2G453snmC\nAll Might @AllMightOfficial\n@bowieb1 Yes!

Toga, from behind the camera, is unfazed.\n\u201cPleeeeeease? Our loyal fans are getting worried about us!\u201d\n\u201cThen go complain to Shigaraki! Not that he\u2019ll listen, of course, there\u2019s absolutely no point in you doing that.\u201d\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not like he banned us from uploading videos! Just from doing murders and stuff! Different thing!\u201d\nTwice appears to consider this for awhile, before conceding. \u201cAlright, fine. For the fans, okay?\u201d he says, then turns fully to look into the camera and peels the lower half of his mask up, exposing his mouth.\n\u201cCheck this out,\u201d he says, then sticks out his tongue and, with a quick twitch, splits it into two tongues with his quirk.\u00a0\n\u00a0---\nTwice Does Tongue Tricks!!\n78,433 views\n\nComments \u2022\u00a090\n\nYoroshika\nokay so you can make out spinner and compress and i thiiiiink dabi (harder to tell cause he wears all black) in the background when the camera starts jerking around but??? no shigaraki?? where is he??\nEmandem\n\ud83d\udc40\nMLPB\nAre we all just gonna ignore the fact that apparently the league\u2019s got a no-murder rule now?

I think the League of Villains is turning vigilante.\nFirst of all, a quick recap for those of you who haven\u2019t been paying attention to the League\u2019s YouTube uploads (and if you haven\u2019t been, I don\u2019t blame you, they have a new channel practically every other week and their videos get taken down even more often- @LOVTracker on Twitter and @AchivingLOV on Tumblr both do great work keeping track of them if you want to catch up):\n- Following the Endeavor v Noumu fight from a few months ago, where Dabi (Todoroki Touya, a story in itself worthy of a post) there\u2019s a period of radio silence from the league, with no high profile attacks. During this time members of the league, starting with Himiko Toga, start uploading youtube videos, mostly little comedic candid moments. They get popular very rapidly and the rest of the League quickly joins in.\n- About three and a half months into the league\u2019s rise to youtube fame, our very own boys at hero theory upload a video (guest starring ALL MIGHT HIMSELF) about Tomura Shigaraki potentially being the grandson of Nana Shimura/Adamant (the focus of hero theory ep 20). Kaminari says in the video that this was partially prompted by the league getting their own channel and the popularity of their other villain-based videos.\n- Around seven hours after this video goes up, the league (specifically Dabi) uploads a video that appears to confirm the theory, and furthermore that the revelation apparently had a hardcore emotional impact on Shigaraki/Shimura(?).\n- About a week later video uploads from the league resume, but with the notable exclusion of Shigaraki. The first video posted after the break (which you can find here) also features Toga saying Shigaraki has banned them \u2018from doing murders and stuff.\u2019\n- A few days later a burgeoning drug trafficking ring based in Musutafu is basically annihilated with signs from both Shigaraki and Dabi\u2019s quirks connected to the scene.\n- What I\u2019m saying is LOV = League of Vigilantes, basically.\n\u00a0---\nLeague Youtube Tracker @LOVTracker\nWe\u2019ve got a new video!!!

He looks absolutely furious, and is clearly blushing. He takes a step forward and the camera immediately disappears into a blur of motion as Toga sprints away, accompanied by manic giggling.\nThe video then cuts to a title card by way of a clumsy Powerpoint transition: League of Villains Reads Thirsty Tweets.\nIt then cuts to Spinner, who is looking down at what is obviously a different phone, reading slowly aloud. \u201cCall me a\u2026 scalie\u2026 but\u2026\u201d he reads before trailing off into stammering silence. \u201cI\u2026 um\u2026 what?\u201d\nIt then cuts to Touya, who stares at the phone for a full half minute without blinking before raising his head to glare flatly at the camera. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cAw, but Touya-\u201d Toga pouts.\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nFinally, it cuts to Twice, who reads his tweets with great enthusiasm and absolutely no hesitation.

She\u2019s sprawled on the sofa in 1-A\u2019s dorm, her legs across Yaoyorozu\u2019s lap. \u201cTheir editing is so bad. Honestly, you\u2019d think these people have never seen Movie Maker in their lives.\u201d\n\u201cNo, babe,\u201d Yaoyorozu says without looking up from her notes.\n\u201cBut-\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t give the villains video editing lessons, Kyouka.\u201d\n\u201cNot even if they really need them?\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0---\nThe video is clearly taken on a phone camera held vertically, shaking slightly as the filmer walks through a decrepit hallway. A green-scaled hand reaches out and shoves a door to the left open, and the footage moves into a moldy bathroom. The tile is yellowish, the rusty tap dripping. The entire sink is stained black. There are rusty splashes of dried blood on the tiles and in the bathroom, and what used to be a white bathmat is now mostly brown.\n\u201cLook at this!\u201d Spinner\u2019s voice says from behind the camera, zooming dramatically in on the bloodstains. \u201cLook! Is it too much to ask for a little decency! Like, we\u2019re fugitives, sure, but we don\u2019t have to live like animals!\u201d\nThe camera footage blurs; it\u2019s evident that Spinner is tossing his arms up in exasperation. \u201cHydrogen peroxide and lemon juice for bloodstains! It\u2019s so easy!\u201d\nThe camera swings over to the stained sink. \u201cAnd for hair dye! Dish soap and vinegar! Again, easy! Or, just a thought, someone could stop being an edgy fuck because the whole world knows he\u2019s a natural redhead now anyways, I\u2019m just saying\u2026\u201d\nHis voice dissolves into inaudible grumbling for a few seconds before he wrenches the cabinet above the sink open. \u201cAnd don\u2019t even get me started on the toothbrushing!

The game footage is lagging just slightly, a sure sign that the streamer is suffering from bad internet, perhaps the kind one might struggle with if one was living under several feet of concrete in an abandoned part of town.\nDespite this, there are upwards of two\u00a0hundred thousand people watching, and the number keeps climbing.\n\u201cFuck!\u201d Shigaraki hisses as a monster appears unexpectedly from behind a wall onscreen, and his character furiously backpedals, spraying the enemy with gunfire.

Eat lasers, bitch, I\u2019m your real god.\u201d\nHe emerges into an open area of the game where some NPCs appear, triggering a cutscene. As it plays, he glances away from the game and at the livestream chat scrolling down the side, squinting at the small words. \u201cYou can ask your questions now, I guess, stupid fuckin\u2019 game doesn\u2019t let you skip the cutscenes.\u201d\nEpicGamerGuyMan\nbruh why not stream on twitch since your youtube videos keep gettin flagged\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t I- because I have standards, that\u2019s why,\u201d Shigaraki says acidically.\nYuyuSho\nr u still in touch with afo?\n\u201cAf- oh.

The rest of the league is clustered around him, listening to the call play out.

Shigaraki waves a hand to quiet her, but his posture has tightened even further, and he looks seconds from hurling the phone into a wall.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he says flatly.\nThere\u2019s a long pause before Ujiko\u2019s voice abruptly says, \u201cVery well,\u201d and the phone hangs up with a click.\nThe resulting silence in the hideout drags out for a long, long time.\n\u201cI think that went well,\u201d Compress says eventually.\n---\u00a0\nCap Addie @bowieb1\nlov fans TURN ON THE NEWS AND LOOK AT WHATS HAPPENING IN KORUSUKAN-KU\nCap Addie @bowieb1\npinging @LOVTracker since they have an actual following\nLeague Youtube Tracker @LOVTracker\no fuck @bowieb1 thanks for the heads up\nLeague Youtube Tracker @LOVTracker\n\u2757\ufe0f\u2757\ufe0f\u2757\ufe0f ALERT: LEAGUE SPOTTED BATTLING NOUMU IN SOUTHERN MUSUTAFU \u2757\ufe0f\u2757\ufe0f\u2757\ufe0f\nLeague Youtube Tracker @LOVTracker\nUpdates to follow as I receive them, in the meantime everyone please don\u2019t panic!\nLeague Youtube Tracker @LOVTracker\nThe story is being covered on most major news channels right now and Korusu-TV has a live helicopter feed.\nLeague Youtube Tracker @LOVTracker\nAll League members confirmed present by various camera shots.\nLeague Youtube Tracker @LOVTracker\nNoumu appears to be the largest one seen yet.

Noumu status: dust in the wind.\n\u00a0---\n\n Breaking News: League of Villains Sighted Battling Noumu in Southern Musutafu \n\nThe League of Villains, famous for their highly-publicized attacks in Hosu and on Yuuei Academy, and more recently for their status as unexpected internet phenomenons, were sighted publically for the first time in weeks today.\nAt approximately 17:20 in the Korusukan district of Musutafu, the police were flooded with calls reporting a massive noumu causing widespread devastation. The presence of the League was also reported; however, callers noted that the League appeared to be attempting to stop the noumu rather than controlling or encouraging it, as was the dynamic witnessed in Hosu.\nHeroes arrived shortly after the noumu was defeated. A search of the scene found no dead bodies save that of the noumu; the League was nowhere to be found, though multiple eyewitnesses have reported members receiving severe injuries in the brawl. Casualties are unknown but, at the moment, it is unlikely that any bystanders died, though some did require hospitalization from falling debris and smoke inhalation.\nAs the situation is still developing, many questions are still unanswered. Foremost being: what happened to place the League at odds with the noumu when in every prior appearance they have been allies? Why did the fight take place? If the League were not controlling this particular noumu, who was?\nThis article will be updated as more facts become clear.\nThe location and status of the League is currently unknown.\n\u00a0---\nThe video is posted about half an hour after the noumu fight. It opens on Twice. He\u2019s not wearing his mask- his face is smoke-stained, hair messy. There\u2019s a gash on his cheek, which he doesn\u2019t seem to notice, and his face is decorated with smaller cuts. He looks exhausted. No other members of the League are visible.\n\u201cHey,\u201d he says. \u201cSo, we\u2019re all pretty fucked up and we also pissed off our go-to doctor. I\u2019ll link a gofundme in the description. If you could donate to it so we, like, don\u2019t die, that would be super awesome.

There\u2019s a television, hooked up by way of several extension cords that snake out of sight, quietly playing a report about the noumu battle.\nShigaraki, pupils blown wide with concussion and one arm obviously broken and inexpertly splinted, leans forward from his perch on a bloody couch to squint at the intruder as the door clangs shut behind him, flexing his functioning hand in preparation to use his quirk. \u201cWho the fuck\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cHey,\u201d Natsuo says, and drops the bag with a heavy thud. \u201cToga gave me your address.

I can\u2019t believe you haven\u2019t keeled over from infection yet.\" Natsuo snorts, standing with the disinfectant tucked under one arm, and glances around the room. \u201cRight, who\u2019s closest to death?\u201d\n\u00a0---\nReason @lovelifeheroes\nday 5 with no word from the lov DDDDD: where are they???\nHitsumi Tatsuya @burnboiburn\nPLS I NEED TO KNOW THEY\u2019RE OKAY I HONESTLY HALF HOPE THEY GET ARRESTED JUST SO THEY CAN GET SOME MEDICAL CARE\nAnna Cisco @theciscokid\nif the only youtube celebs ive genuinely liked in years are dead im gonna be so mad\nLeague Youtube Tracker @LOVTracker\n\u2757\ufe0f\u2757\ufe0fNEW VIDEO! NEW VIDEO! NEW VIDEO! LINKS BELOW!\u2757\ufe0f\u2757\ufe0f\n\u00a0---\nThe first video in a week to be posted to a villain channel opens on a face that the viewers aren\u2019t familiar with, with a shock of bright white hair. There\u2019s a surgical mask pulled up over his face, but his eyes are crinkled up as though with a grin.\n(In the UA dorm, Todoroki Shouto swears and drops Kaminari\u2019s phone.)\n\u201cHey!\u201d the mystery person says, waving at the camera. \u201cSorry, not quite back to regular programming yet. But since I\u2019ve seen Twitter blowing up for the past few days, I thought you guys would appreciate some reassurance.\u201d\n\u201cFirst of all,\u201d he says, and the camera flips around as he walks through a door, \u201cthe idiots are all still alive.\u201d\nThe camera pans over Spinner (clean bandages running across his chest and one arm in a sling) and Toga (bandages wrapped around her head, giving the camera a peace sign) and pauses briefly on Touya, who has one leg in a cast and what looks to be a makeshift crutch fashioned out of fused scrap metal leaned up next to him, and is pointedly looking anywhere but the camera.\n\u201cFeeling better, Touya?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Fuck off.\u201d\n\u201cNever. You\u2019re stuck with me now.\u201d\n\u201cThis is hell,\u201d Touya tells the ceiling, irritably flipping off the camera in what looks like an almost automatic gesture. \u201cI\u2019m in hell.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you deserve it,\u201d the cameraman says primly before panning to the next target- Compress, whose shoulder and torso are heavily bandaged and whose usual coat is absent.\nCompress nods politely to the camera, or perhaps to the cameraman, before the pan continues and comes to an eventual halt on Shigaraki.\nShigaraki has one arm in a cast and appears to have his ribs wrapped in pressure bandages. There\u2019s a bright pink bandaid on one cheek. He glares directly at the camera.\n\u201cWhat,\u201d he says, the word clearly directed at the mystery person behind the camera.\n\u201cYour fans want to know just what happened in Korusukan!\u201d\n\u201cHow was I supposed to know that?\u201d Shigaraki complains. \u201cYou won\u2019t even let me use my phone.\u201d\n\u201cScreens are bad for concussions!\u201d the cameraman says. The camera shakes slightly- one gets the sense a finger is being waved. \u201cYou\u2019ll make the headaches worse. No screens. That\u2019s doctor\u2019s orders.\u201d\nShigaraki groans dramatically. \u201cFine. Not like it\u2019s much of a story, anyways. Just one old geezer being a real bastard.\u201d\n\u201cWe broke up with our old doc,\u201d Twice calls from offscreen. He sticks his face into frame from Shigaraki\u2019s other side, and it can be seen that his face is plastered with colorful bandaids. \u201cAnd he was a bitch about it!\u201d\n\u201cIneloquent but basically correct,\u201d Compress agrees, half-visible on the other edge of the frame.\nShigaraki rolls his eyes and waves the hand that\u2019s not immobilized in a cast, as if to say \u2018yeah, that.\u2019 \u201cYeah, that. So he set his latest greatest pet monstrosity on us, and we kicked its weak ass.\u201d\nThere are some cheers from offscreen. It sounds like Spinner and Toga.\n\u201cRight, so that\u2019s been this week\u2019s League of Dumbasses update,\u201d the cameraman says, flipping the camera around to focus on himself again. \u201cStay tuned for more when they\u2019re all more recovered.

Todoroki, in the desk behind him, ignores him, eyes focused on his phone.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s perfect! The villain episodes have always been hella popular, and since we know nothing about the guy we could go wild with theories! Who is he? Where did he come from? How did he get in contact with the League?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cBut why?\u201d Kaminari whines, leaning back even further to make upside-down puppy eyes at Todoroki. Suddenly, he straightens up, chair legs thumping against the floor, and whips around to look at Todoroki normally. \u201cUnless\u2026 you know something?\u201d\nTodoroki does not make eye contact. Kaminari gasps loud and long enough that Kirishima reaches over to thump him on the back, prompting a fit of coughing. Once he\u2019s recovered, he says, \u201cYou do!\u201d\nTodoroki is silent for a long moment, then rolls his eyes, pulls something up on his phone, and shoves it into Kaminari\u2019s chest. Kaminari has to scramble to grab it before it falls on the floor, and squints against the glare of the classroom lights on the screen.\nIt\u2019s a family picture. It\u2019s a picture of a picture, really, an old and slightly singed photograph carefully aligned with the phone\u2019s camera. There\u2019s a mother, an instantly recognizable father, and four young children, all looking various degrees of stiffly uncomfortable.\nKaminari focuses first on Touya (\u201cHe has a face!\u201d \u201cOf course he has a face, did you think he was born with staples?\u201d), so it\u2019s a moment before he sees it.\n\u201cDude.\u201d\nA sigh. \u201cI know.\u201d\n\u201cDude. Todoroki, your family.\u201d\nTodoroki buries his face in his hands. \u201cI know.\u201d\n\u00a0---\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying people should storm Tartarus to kill All for One,\u201d Spinner says, and then gives the camera an extremely meaningful look. Toga, seated crosslegged beside him on the sofa, nods seriously. \u201cBut if I was, I\u2019d say to do it all on one day, say, the fifteenth, and in a big group, and do it at around, oh, six PM, at about the time the guards are changing shifts-\u201d\n\u201cSpinner, what the fuck are you doing?\u201d Dabi\u00a0shouts from offscreen.\n\u201cNothing!\u201d Spinner yells back.\n\u201cHe\u2019s organizing All for One\u2019s death by mob violence!\u201d Toga answers brightly at the same time.\nThere\u2019s quiet for a moment.\n\u201cI guess that\u2019s okay, then,\u201d Dabi finally says.\n---\u00a0\nStorm Tartarus to Kill All for One (+ Explaining the Korusukan Thing)\n837,402 views\n\nComments \u2022 1,927\n\nBad for Education\nGfhdsjkgaf \u2018if you see this old bald bastard just brain him with a brick\u2019 god i love the LOV\nYonsenen\nwelp time to mark my calendar for the raid let\u2019s do this\nAkio Yamato\nWAIT WAIT at the start at 0:03 that\u2019s the doctor guy\u2019s voice in the bg???

Said stream opens on a shot of the white-haired doctor sitting on the beaten couch that\u2019s become a staple of the League\u2019s videos. This time, he\u2019s not wearing the facemask. Toga and Twice are perched next to him, leaning together over a phone.\n\u201cOkay!\u201d Toga chirps, clapping her hands excitedly. \u201cLet\u2019s do this! Twice and I will read off questions and N- our friend here will answer!\u201d\nSaid friend gives the camera a grin and a thumbs up.\n\u201cFirst question- oh, a lot of people are asking what his name is. Sorry! We agreed to save that till the end!\u201d\n\u201cFor maximum dramatic impact,\u201d Twice agrees.\n\u201cSo just skipping over that to the next one for now- \u2018how old are you?\u2019\u201d\n\u201cNineteen!\u201d Natsuo answers easily.\nTwice shakes his head, managing to come across as\u00a0somewhat forlorn even through his mask. \u201cI still don\u2019t understand how you\u2019re younger than almost all of us. I mean, I ate my Wheaties. I exercised. What did I do wrong?\u201d\nToga pats his arm, and scrolls down to the next question on the screen with her other hand. \u201c\u2018How did you end up working with the League?\u2019 Oh! I can answer this one! He messaged me on Twitter and said he wanted to help! And when he told me who he was I said sure! Next question- \u2018Are you a doctor?\u2019\u201d\n\u201cNope!\u201d Natsuo says. \u201cNot a licensed one, anyways. I\u2019m in med school. I\u2019m gonna be focused in therapy, assuming I don\u2019t get arrested over this.\u201d\nToga blinks. \u201cOooh, could that happen?\u201d\nA shrug. \u201cProbably not. I haven\u2019t committed any actual crimes or anything. Since you guys haven\u2019t done any murdering since I\u2019ve been helping you I don\u2019t think I\u2019m even an accomplice.\u201d\n\u201cHey, more motivation for us to stay on the more-or-less straight and narrow!\u201d Twice says.\nToga nods. \u201cMhm! Next question- oh, actually I don\u2019t know this. \u2018What\u2019s your quirk?\u2019\u201d\nNatsuo grins. \u201cI don\u2019t have one!\u201d\nToga and Twice both gawk in almost comical unison. \u201cReally?\u201d\nThere\u2019s a sigh in the background of the video, and then Dabi walks into frame, pausing behind the sofa. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s true. Even bigger disappointment than me.\u201d\n\u201cHell yeah,\u201d the disappointment in question says, and holds up a fist for a fist bump. Dabi gives it a flat look.\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cYou have, like, seven years of absence to make up, you brat, do it or I\u2019ll call in Fuyumi.\u201d\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cYou wanna try me?\u201d\nDabi groans, and bumps his fist against Natsuo\u2019s. Twice and Toga are grinning as though the entire exchange is the best thing they\u2019ve ever seen. Dabi glares at them and shoves his hands in his pockets.\n\u201cWhat are you smiling about, you morons?\u201d he snaps, and doesn\u2019t wait for an answer before storming off screen.\n\u201cI love you,\u201d Twice tells Natsuo seriously.\nNatsuo grins, and points a thumb towards the camera. \u201cThink they\u2019ve figured it out after that?\u201d\nToga giggles. \u201cMaybe! But we should probably be sure there's no confusion. So, final question! \u2018What's your name?\u2019\u201d\nIn response, their guest leans forward, looking directly into the camera with a wide grin, and says, \u201cNatsuo Todoroki.\u201d\n---\u00a0\nNew Doctor: Q&amp;A (500k Milestone!!)\n1,867,489 views\n\nComments \u2022 2,746\n\nMissNova\ni- a- w- WHAT\nFutsuka Mikka\nSOMEONE PLEASE GET SHOUTO ON CAMERA WITH A REACTION STAT\nAkio Yamato\n^^^ Kaminari lend an EAR\nNanana1\nyknow since the legal definition of vigilantism is \u2018unlicensed quirk use\u2019 if he's quirkless our boy natsuo can't be arrested for vigilantism anyways\nMimeija\nGod how angry do you think Endeavor is rn\n\u00a0---\ngoodforhealth reblogged from n30t0ky0\nso of the todorokis we know about, one is the number one hero, one is a hero student and youtube celeb, one is a famous villain and youtube celeb, and one is a vigilante doctor (and youtube celeb)\nwhat is WITH this FAMILY\n\n2,849 notes\n\n\u00a0---\n\n Suspect Behind Korusukan Noumu Attack Arrested \n\nDr. Ujiko Daruma (mugshot shown at right), cited by the League of Villains as the creator and controller of the massive noumu that ravaged Korusukan earlier this month, was found this morning outside the door of the Musutafu Central Police Department with his hands tied behind his back.\nThe suspect had severe burns and had lost a lot of blood from what appeared to be a series of knife wounds, and was also missing the fingers of his right hand.\nMr. Ujiko has been brought to the hospital for surgery and will be under heavy police guard until such time as he has recovered suitably to stand trial for the crimes he is accused of, which include human experimentation, causing grave injury, and mass property damage.\nInvestigation into his true identity is ongoing, as a person named \u2018Ujiko Daruma\u2019 has never legally existed.
