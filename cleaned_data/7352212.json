    "text": "\n\u201cKeith.\u201d\n\n\nHis hands are sweating in his gloves, slippery on the controls he\u2019s holding in a death grip. He glances up to the screen and sees Lance\u2019s image. His eyes are hard and focused under a pinched brow, entirely focused on maneuvering his Lion through the maelstrom. Keith has never seen him look so serious.\n\n\n\u201cKeith, if we make it out of this alive, I\u2019m going to kiss you.\u201d\n\n\nAnd then his feed blinks out, leaving Keith feeling awfully and terribly alone.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen he opens his eyes, everything is bathed in a red haze. There\u2019s a distant beeping that\u2019s just loud enough to be annoying, and it\u2019s what Keith latches onto to pull himself into consciousness. He\u2019s sprawled out across the floor, head bent at an uncomfortable angle up against the control panel, torso facing up while his lower half is twisted to the side. And he has absolutely no will to get up. Even without moving, he feels stiff and sore and who knows how long he\u2019s been lying here like this?\n\n\nIt\u2019s when he feels a tug at his consciousness that he actually realizes he should probably try to get up. \u201cRed\u2026?\u201d\n\n\nHis Lion is prompting him. He can feel the waves of concern lapping over his mind like a balm. After a few minutes of deep breathing, he\u2019s able to muster enough strength to twist his legs into the proper position and sit up. He groans and rubs at his neck, which aches with the worst crick he\u2019s ever had. \n\n\n\u201cYou there, buddy?\u201d he asks his Lion. \n\n\nThere\u2019s a soothing hum in reply, but the ominous beeping continues and it\u2019s obvious that everything is not all right with the machine. From the slight tilt to the floor, Keith thinks that they\u2019ve landed lopsided. Wherever they are\u2026\n\n\nWith a jolt, the disastrous escape from the Galra command comes back all at once. The wormhole malfunction\u2026 Keith\u2019s hand flies up to his comm and activates it. \u201cHello? Shiro? Allura? Is anyone there?\u201d\n\n\nHe\u2019s answered by static.\n\n\nHis stomach gives a violent lurch. He has to get out and see where he is. He can\u2019t panic yet. \n\n\nBut when he climbs to his feet, pain sears through his middle and he doubles over with a groan, latching onto the chair for support. Well, this isn\u2019t good. Hope nothing\u2019s broken. It takes a minute or two, but the pain eventually dies down and he\u2019s able to straighten up. His side throbs but he figures if he doesn\u2019t move too quickly it\u2019s bearable at least.\n\n\nFirst thing\u2019s first, he needs to run a diagnostic on Red. The screen lights up under his fingers and he breathes a sigh of relief. While the diagnostic is processing, he opens the visuals screen and finds himself looking out at a forest landscape. Red\u2019s head is nestled in a copse of tall, vine-like plants and Keith can\u2019t see very far out due to all the foliage. \n\n\nHe sits back in the accelerator chair and gingerly presses against his ribcage. There\u2019s definite bruising. At worst some cracked ribs, but nothing gives under his fingers so it\u2019s probably safe to say nothing\u2019s broken. He can deal with that. When he takes stock of the rest of his body, he discovers blossoming bruises and aching joints, and his neck is sore beyond belief, but nothing is terribly alarming. \n\n\nHe tries the comm link two more times before the diagnostic check is complete with no success. \n\n\nThe list is\u2026not as bad as he\u2019d feared. But it\u2019s certainly not good. Namely, the main power feeds to the engine were damaged in the crash which means he won\u2019t be flying Red Lion anywhere anytime soon. And while he\u2019s got the basics of mechanics down, he\u2019s no genius like Pidge and he doesn\u2019t trust his skill enough to mess with the Lion\u2019s inner workings. \n\n\n\u201cLooks like I\u2019m going to have to get us out of this,\u201d he mutters. \n\n\nAs a bit of an afterthought, he tries the comm one more time through the screen. His gut\u2019s already sinking at another failed attempt when he receives nothing but white noise in return, but then\u2026 He hears something vaguely resembling a voice through the crackling. \n\n\nHe pulls in a sharp breath, two fingers flying up to the earpiece in his helmet. \u201cHello? Is someone there? Hello?\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\u2026eith\u2026k\u2026s\u2014at you?\u201d\n\n\nBlood is rushing in Keith\u2019s ears. He moves around the cockpit slowly to see if he can pick up a better signal. \u201cHello? Hey! Who\u2019s there? I can\u2019t\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cK\u2026Keith!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLance?\u201d Keith is so relieved to hear him he\u2019s actually smiling. When did things get so bad that even Lance\u2019s voice would bring a smile to his face? \u201cOh, thank god. Where are you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t know. Somewhere in a forest, I think.\u201d\n\n\nKeith sinks into his chair in relief. \u201cOkay. Good. Me too. You must not be too far off.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cKeith\u2026\u201d\n\n\nHe taps on his screens. \u201cCan you activate your tracking signal? I\u2019m turning on my scanner. I\u2019ll see if I can find you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t\u2026Keith, I\u2019m\u2026\u201d \n\n\nKeith pauses. Now that the signal\u2019s clearing up, he can hear Lance\u2019s voice better. It sounds strained, breathless. And not at all like Lance\u2019s usual tone.\n\n\n\u201cLance?\u201d A feeling of unease settles in his gut. His newly settled heartbeat begins to race again. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? You okay?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t\u2014I can\u2019t get to the control panel. My leg is\u2014I think my leg is broken. I can\u2019t move it.\u201d He\u2019s breathing hard, his panting coming in harsh, crackly puffs over the mic. \u201cKeith, it hurts.\u201d\n\n\nShit. A sick feeling rolls through Keith\u2019s gut. Lance sounds scared, and that\u2019s probably the most unsettling thing. He can hear his pain through the rickety comm connection\u2014he sounds like he\u2019s in agony. It\u2019s so unlike him that Keith feels tingling panic creep up his spine, making a sweat break out all over his body. It must be bad. \n\n\nKeith takes a deep breath in through his nose. If Lance is panicking that means he has to be the one to keep his head. Good thing he\u2019s never had a hard time staying calm even when he\u2019s terrified. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s okay, Lance. I\u2019ll find you. You just sit tight and don\u2019t move. I\u2019ll come get you.\u201d\n\n\nHe hears Lance take several steadying breaths as well. \u201cOkay. Okay.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing a long-range scan. Trying to see if Red\u2019ll pick you up.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026 Just stay on the comm, okay?\u201d\n\n\nKeith swallows hard. He sounds so frightened. Keith\u2019s overcome with the need to put his mind at ease. \u201cWhy? You miss the sound of my voice?\u201d\n\n\nLance huffs out something resembling a laugh. \u201cSomething like that, I guess.\u201d\n\n\nKeith hums. Meanwhile his eyes are trained on the red waves on the screen, looking desperately for any indicator that something\u2019s out there.\n\n\n\u201cHey, Keith, how\u2019re you? How\u2019s Red Lion?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m, uh. I\u2019m a little banged up, but I\u2019m okay. Red\u2019s not getting up, though.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Blue can get up either. I can\u2019t feel her.\u201d\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s, well, that\u2019s equally as unsettling. If Lance can\u2019t even feel Blue Lion\u2019s connection, their crash must have been really, really bad.\n\n\n\u201cHave you heard from any of the others?\u201d Lance asks. \n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d He taps out a few more commands. \u201cYou\u2019re the only one I\u2019ve gotten through to.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWh\u2026where do you think they are?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a clue.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow\u2019re we gonna\u2026how\u2019re we gonna find \u2018em if our Lions aren\u2019t working?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll find a way, Lance. Everything\u2019s gonna be fine.\u201d Keith\u2019s fingers beat incessantly on the panel. \n\n\nThen, at long last, the scan picks up a signal and he sits up straight in his chair reflexively. And then he stifles a groan and cradles the ache in his side. \n\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he says through gritted teeth. \u201cI locked onto your signal. It looks like you\u2019re a mile or so away, so I\u2019m gonna pack a few things and start heading over there.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSounds great.\u201d \n\n\nThey fall into silence while Keith rummages through the stores and fishes out a med kit, an emergency pack, and all the spare rations he can find. He stuffs them in the pack, takes another good look around to make sure he isn\u2019t leaving anything important, and opens Red Lion\u2019s hatch. \n\n\nGetting down is a bit more daunting than he expected. Every sudden movement sends pain jolting through his torso, and it\u2019s all he can do to keep from grunting. He can hear Lance\u2019s heavy breathing through the mic and aggressively tries not to think of how bad a situation they\u2019re in, or how much worse it could become. \n\n\n\u201cHow you holdin\u2019 up, Lance?\u201d Keith asks after he\u2019s been trudging through underbrush for a solid five minutes.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m great. Just dandy.\u201d\n\n\nKeith frowns. \u201cSeriously. How are you feeling?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMy leg\u2019s pretty numb now, so I guess that\u2019s an improvement.\u201d More ragged breathing. \u201cBut I\u2019m tired. Like, really, really tired.\u201d\n\n\nKeith swings his Bayard at another branch. \u201cStay with me \u2019til I get there.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Lance gasps, and then grunts like he\u2019s shifting his weight. \u201cJust hurry up.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDoing my best.\u201d\n\n\nIt\u2019s hot. Keith\u2019s hair is damp with sweat and is clinging to his neck and face. He kind of wants to take his suit off, but figures it\u2019s not a risk worth taking. For one, he needs to keep his helmet on to talk to Lance. For another, who knows what kinds of things these weird alien plants could do to him if he touched them with his bare skin. He can feel the back of his spandex suit getting soaked, but he\u2019ll put up with it. It\u2019s only a mile. \n\n\nThat\u2019s what he keeps chanting in his head as he continues to trek through dense foliage. A new ache has started up in his shoulder and his neck won\u2019t stop hurting no matter which way he turns it and the pain in his side has gone from a dull throb to a sharp stabbing. He probably should\u2019ve checked it out before he left his Lion, but he\u2019s eager to get to Lance, who\u2019s in a much worse condition.\n\n\nIt takes longer than he\u2019d like, but eventually the little blip on his visor\u2019s tracker comes into range. He catches glimpses of blue between the leaves and feels a new surge of energy. \n\n\n\u201cLance, I\u2019m here. I\u2019m outside,\u201d he says as he carefully climbs over a giant root and finally enters the clearing.\n\n\nHe freezes.\n\n\nThe Blue Lion looks terrible. It\u2019s lying on its side, face and body covered in dirt and uprooted plants. Keith doesn\u2019t even have to get close to see the gashes and dents in the metal and places where the paint is chipped off. It\u2019s a sickening sight. \n\n\nHe limps as quickly as he can to the Lion\u2019s mouth. \u201cCan you open the hatch?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2026I\u2019m trying.\u201d Lance\u2019s breathing is picking up again, punctuated by grunts of pain. \u201cThis isn\u2019t\u2014augh!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLance?\u201d Keith stares up at the robot, feeling incredibly helpless. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\n\n\nFor a few moments he doesn\u2019t answer, and Keith has to listen to his labored breaths as he tries to get the pain under control. Then he hears Lance groan and hiss. \u201cOh, god, I\u2014ah, fucking shit\u2014m-my leg isn\u2019t\u2026numb anymore.\u201d\n\n\nKeith\u2019s hands curl into fists. \u201cBe careful. Take it slow.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\n\nListening to Lance drag his injured body across the floor is hard and sets Keith on edge. When the hatch finally opens, he has to force himself not to sprint inside. As much as he wants to, sudden movements aren\u2019t a good idea for him either. So he gets to the cockpit as quickly as he can.\n\n\nAnd freezes again. This time panic spikes through from his chest all the way down to his feet. \n\n\nHe was not prepared for how bad Lance looks.\n\n\nHe\u2019s barely sitting up, upper body leaning heavily against the dashboard, one hand still resting on the button for the hatch. His right leg is stretched out before him awkwardly, bent at an unnatural angle. The armor there is smashed in and cracked along the shin. The rest of his suit is scuffed and dented\u2026and spattered in blood. When Keith looks closer, he can see trails of it on the accelerator chair and various parts of the cockpit. \n\n\n\u201cLance!\u201d He quickly removes his helmet and tosses it to the side before rushing to the injured boy and dropping to his knees. He helps Lance take off his helmet as well and is instantly struck by how pale and sweaty his face is. There\u2019s a trail of dried blood leaking from his nose. \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d\n\n\nHis eyes are half-closed. He seems dazed. \u201cBetter, now that you\u2019re here.\u201d\n\n\nKeith has to forcibly keep himself from brushing back short locks of damp hair. If these were normal circumstances, Lance would never hear the end of it for making a comment like that. Now, though, all Keith feels is a concerning tug in his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. You\u2019re gonna be okay.\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\u2018Course I am.\u201d\n\n\nKeith\u2019s eyes roam over the blue paladin\u2019s prone form, trying to decide the best course of action to take. Nothing about this is going to be pleasant. \u201cWe need to get your suit off.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI was afraid you were gonna say that.\u201d\n\n\nIt\u2019s a slow and painstaking process, but they manage to remove it piece by piece. The blood, he discovers, originated from multiple lacerations at various places on Lance\u2019s body where the plating was punctured. He\u2019ll need to patch them up, but for the time being they\u2019re not too concerning. When Keith moves to his injured leg, however, Lance reaches out a hand to stop him.\n\n\n\u201cWait. Can\u2019t we just\u2026leave that part on?\u201d His voice is weak and trembles at the end of the sentence.\n\n\n\u201cI have to get to your leg to treat it, idiot,\u201d Keith says. \u201cI\u2019ll be careful. Take a deep breath.\u201d\n\n\nLance does. His hands clench into fists and he bites down on his lip. When Keith\u2019s fingers grip the warped material, he lets out a pitiful whimper and Keith almost lets go, but steels his nerves at the last second and lifts off the armor. \n\n\n\u201cMmmmph,\u201d Lance groans, doubling over.\n\n\nKeith is sweating. \u201cYou okay?\u201d\n\n\nThe taller boy breathes unevenly for a few moments before giving a shaky thumbs up. \n\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Keith turns his attention to his injured leg and winces at the sight of it. It\u2019s definitely broken. Thankfully there\u2019s no exposed bone, but there is a noticeable bend in the shin a few inches below the knee and it\u2019s swollen and purple. \n\n\nHe must be making a face, because Lance is watching him closely. \u201cHow bad is it?\u201d\n\n\nKeith pulls his lip under his teeth. \u201cIt could be worse, but\u2026I\u2019m gonna have to set it.\u201d\n\n\nLance\u2019s eyes widen in what looks very much like terror and his chest begins to heave. \u201cNo. No, Keith, please, it\u2014it really, really hurts. Please don\u2019t touch it. Please.\u201d\n\n\nIf Keith was told that one day Lance would be begging him for something, he never would have believed it. He hates that his pleading, desperate tone makes his heart feels like it\u2019s tearing in half. Lance is outright shaking and Keith knows he\u2019s not exaggerating at all.\n\n\n\u201cI have to. You know that.\u201d\n\n\nLance looks sick. He\u2019s paler than Keith has ever seen him, but he swallows and sets his jaw firmly. \u201cI know, I just\u2026 Oh, fuck. O-okay. Just\u2026just do it fast.\u201d\n\n\nKeith nods. His heart is pounding. He set his own finger, one time, when he was out in his shack and tripped and fell on it wrong, and he\u2019s taken enough first aid to have a good idea about what to do, but actually doing it to someone else\u2026 Well, it\u2019s not like he can do more damage. It\u2019ll be\u2026fine.\n\n\nThe med kits are well-stocked, fortunately. He finds something to splint Lance\u2019s leg with and sets it down at the ready beside him. Then he positions his hands on either side of the break. He\u2019s always prided himself on being able to do what needs to be done, even if it\u2019s hard, so he digs down deep to find that resolve, to forget about who he\u2019s about to do this to, and to forget the terror thrumming in his veins. He takes a deep breath. And then he snaps the bone back into place.\n\n\nLance screams. \n\n\nAnd god, Keith would trade anything to be able to forget that sound. \n\n\nHe splints the leg and wraps it up as tightly as he can, as quickly as he can, because Lance seems nearly delirious with pain and he won\u2019t be able to keep his hands steady much longer. He fishes out painkillers and water, but he no longer knows what to do. Lance is making wounded sounds, head pressed back against the dash, fingers clenching and unclenching on the floor at his sides, chest heaving tremendously and his eyes clamped shut. And\u2014\n\n\nOh, shit, there are tears streaming down his face. \n\n\nKeith is suddenly struck with the desire to pull him into his arms. He blinks, utterly confused as to where that came from. Absolutely not. Instead he scoots a bit closer and puts a hand on the blue paladin\u2019s shoulder. \u201cLance? You okay?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPeachy,\u201d he gasps. His brow is knit and his skin glistens with sweat. \n\n\nKeith pushes the sick feeling of guilt deep, deep down. \u201cWell, at least that\u2019s over with.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not\u2014ever\u2014doing that\u2014again.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll thank me later when your leg doesn\u2019t heal crooked.\u201d He holds out a hand with the painkillers. \u201cHere. Take these.\u201d\n\n\nLance pours them in his mouth, but his hands are shaking so badly he can\u2019t grip the water bottle. It\u2019s strange to see him acting so weak and pitiful, and Keith doesn\u2019t want to admit that he\u2019s currently filled with concern and sympathy, so he counteracts it by rolling his eyes before he takes the water bottle and holds it up to Lance\u2019s lips. \n\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Lance breathes once he\u2019s swallowed. \n\n\n\u201cD-don\u2019t mention it.\u201d Keith busies himself with tending to the multiple gashes Lance is sporting, tearing open a packet of antiseptic wipes with his teeth. \n\n\nLance groans when he presses it to the slice on his arm and lets his head fall back again. \u201cMan, this sucks.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cHow long do you think we\u2019ll be stuck here?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Keith says. \u201cHopefully not too long. Allura and Coran\u2019ll be looking for us. The castleship has that long-range scanner, and with both our Lions on this planet I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll take them long to find us.\u201d\n\n\nThis seems to set Lance\u2019s mind at ease a little bit. \u201cYeah\u2026yeah. You\u2019re right.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNever thought I\u2019d hear those words come out of your mouth.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, well, I never thought I\u2019d be stranded on an alien planet and have you nursing my wounds.\u201d\n\n\nKeith smirks a little as he tapes a patch of gauze over the cut. \u201cFair enough, I guess.\u201d\n\n\nHe finishes tending to the rest in silence. Once the last bandage is on, he sits back and blows out a long breath. Now that things are calming down a bit, he can feel his own injuries aching more prominently. \n\n\nLance suddenly wraps his arms around himself and shivers. \u201cS\u2019cold in here.\u201d\n\n\nAnd that brings them to a new problem. \u201cWe need to make a fire,\u201d Keith says. \u201cBut for that we need to go outside.\u201d\n\n\nLance pales again. \u201cI\u2019m not\u2026I don\u2019t know if I can\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCan you try?\u201d Keith doesn\u2019t mean for his voice to come out sounding so soft, but it does. \u201cYou need to keep warm.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t you, like, not supposed to move broken limbs? I think I remember that from class.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s more important to make sure you don\u2019t die of hypothermia.\u201d\n\n\nLance heaves a pained sigh. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026probably right. God, I can\u2019t believe I just said that again.\u201d\n\n\nKeith laughs softly. \u201cRemind me to hold it over your head later.\u201d He heaves himself up, concealing a wince when the movement pulls at his side. \u201cI\u2019m going to scope out a place to make camp. Be right back.\u201d\n\n\nHe\u2019s almost to the hatch when Lance calls out after him. \u201cKeith?\u201d\n\n\nHe pauses to look back. \u201cYeah?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCan you, uh\u2026bring your helmet with you? Just in case.\u201d\n\n\nKeith opens his mouth, intending to tease him about getting lonely, but stops when he sees the blush spread over Lance\u2019s cheeks and he realizes, oh, he\u2019s still scared. And he just\u2026can\u2019t bring himself to tease him like this. A rush of warmth pools in his stomach and for a split second he acknowledges it as affection. \n\n\nHe ends up blinking awkwardly. \u201cUh, y-yeah. Sure, no problem.\u201d He scoops up his helmet from the ground and puts it on. \u201cBe back soon.\u201d\n\n\nThe night air is colder outside Blue Lion. Once he\u2019s out and away from Lance, he realizes that his heart is beating fast. At first he thinks it\u2019s because of the intensity of what just transpired. He\u2019s certainly shaken\u2014seeing Lance in this condition is way more unsettling than he could\u2019ve imagined. Lance, who\u2019s usually so cocky and energetic and cracking bad jokes every ten seconds, trembling and terrified and in so much pain he can\u2019t even put on a brave face, let alone criticize Keith about anything. It\u2026makes Keith feel weird. \n\n\nThat isn\u2019t all of it, though. He can still feel the warmth of Lance\u2019s skin on his fingertips, smell the faint scent of exhaust and sweat emanating from him\u2014which should\u2019ve been disgusting, but for some reason he wasn\u2019t disgusted. He wanted to run his fingers through Lance\u2019s hair, wipe away his tears and smooth the distressed wrinkles between his brows. He wants to comfort him, protect him, make sure he knows that he won\u2019t let anything happen to him. And that\u2019s\u2026that\u2019s concerning. He isn\u2019t sure when he started becoming endeared by Lance\u2019s smile instead of annoyed by it, or when he\u2019d come to look forward to their bickering, or when he\u2019d stopped thinking of the blue paladin as an asshole and started noticing little indications of insecurity and doubt instead. It must have been very recently. He\u2019s always thought Lance was attractive, but actually being attracted to him is something else entirely. \n\n\nA memory suddenly strikes him, something Lance had said. But that couldn\u2019t be right\u2014\n\n\n\u201cKeith?\u201d\n\n\nHe stops in his tracks. \u201cI\u2019m here. You okay?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah. Just wondering if you\u2019ve found anything yet.\u201d\n\n\nRight. Campground. \u201cUh, not yet. Still looking.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHurry it up before I f-freeze, will ya?\u201d\n\n\nThe introspection will have to wait until later.\n\n\nHe ends up finding a nice spot where the roots of a massive tree form an overhang. At least, he hopes it\u2019ll be nice. He still doesn\u2019t know anything about the planet they\u2019re stranded on, and he doesn\u2019t really want to learn the hard way. But right now, their options are very limited. \n\n\n\u201cOkay, I found a place. I\u2019m coming back now.\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\u2018Bout time.\u201d\n\n\nOn his way back, he grabs a long, sturdy stick with a fork at one end and thinks it might work as a crutch. He\u2019s apprehensive about moving Lance, but as long as they do it carefully, there shouldn\u2019t be too much issue. \n\n\nWhen he returns, Lance takes off his helmet and gives a tiny smile. There\u2019s a fluttering in Keith\u2019s belly that he adamantly ignores. \u201cReady?\u201d\n\n\nLance shrugs. \u201cAs I\u2019ll ever be.\u201d\n\n\nKeith kneels beside him and hands him the crutch, which he takes without comment. Then he loops one arm over his shoulders and braces himself to stand and support Lance\u2019s weight. His side gives another tweak, but he ignores that too. \u201cI\u2019m gonna stand up now.\u201d\n\n\nLance exhales slowly. \u201cOkay. Okay. Let\u2019s do this.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll go slow.\u201d\n\n\nLance\u2019s hair tickles the side of his face as he nods. Keith can feel the taller boy\u2019s lean muscles contracting under his hands as they stand together, and he pretends like he doesn\u2019t notice. \n\n\nLance grunts in pain as his leg slowly moves from lying horizontal to vertical. He tucks the stick up under his armpit and shuffles a bit until he\u2019s adequately supported, breathing harshly all the while. \u201cAll right. I\u2019m good.\u201d\n\n\nThey set off. Keith underestimated just how slow a pace they\u2019d have to keep. Not that he\u2019s complaining, necessarily. Lance\u2019s breath comes in damp puffs against his neck and his torso is solid and warm beneath the black spandex suit. He hasn\u2019t ever been so close to Lance for such a long period of time before. It feels strangely intimate.\n\n\nThe hardest part is getting down the ramp. They\u2019re both concentrating so hard that Keith can\u2019t even be distracted by Lance\u2019s tall body pressing against him. Once they\u2019re on the ground, though, the going is a bit smoother and it only takes a few more minutes before Keith is helping lower Lance to the ground under the roots.\n\n\n\u201cFu-huh-huuuck,\u201d Lance whispers on an exhale as he stretches his leg out again.\n\n\n\u201cYou good?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMhmm.\u201d \n\n\nHe\u2019s not; Keith can see that, but Lance has taken such a big blow to his pride today already that he lets it go. Instead he runs back to get the kits, shoves a ration bar and a water bottle into Lance\u2019s hands, and goes about making a fire. \n\n\nHe\u2019s kneeling beside a pile of dry tinder and twigs to light it with some futuristic space lighter he\u2019d found in a pack when he can\u2019t hide it anymore. One wrong move sends pain stabbing through his middle and before he knows what\u2019s happened, he\u2019s letting out a strangled cry and hunching over himself, lighter dropped in the wood. \n\n\n\u201cKeith?\u201d Lance shuffles in the leaves like he\u2019s trying to get up. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\n\nKeith rolls back onto his ass and cradles his ribcage. \u201cNothing. I just\u2026I think I bruised something in the crash.\u201d\n\n\nIn the light provided by Keith\u2019s helmet, he sees Lance frown. \u201cYou better let me take a look.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLet me finish this first.\u201d He picks up the lighter again and manages to get a fire going this time. He nurses the flame into a small blaze before packing up the supplies and scooting himself gingerly back towards Lance. \n\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s time for you to take off your suit,\u201d Lance says.\n\n\nSomething about his expression causes Keith to blush. He undresses quickly down to his under-suit and rolls up the hem of his shirt. They both wince when his ribcage is uncovered. There\u2019s a long gash along the left side, surrounded by dark, red-purple bruising that mottles the majority of his torso. The swelling makes it look downright nasty.\n\n\n\u201cDude,\u201d Lance says. \u201cHow the heck have you been carrying me around like that?\u201d\n\n\nKeith shrugs. \u201cYou do what you gotta do. I don\u2019t think anything\u2019s broken.\u201d \n\n\nLance raises his eyebrows, and if Keith didn\u2019t know any better he\u2019d say he looks impressed. He mutters something under his breath that sounds an awful lot like, \u201cYou should\u2019ve told me.\u201d After staring at the wound intently for a few seconds, he holds out a hand. \u201cHand me the first aid kit.\u201d\n\n\nKeith huffs, but does as he asks. \u201cI can just patch it up myself, you know. You need to be taking it easy.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNah, I gotta return the favor or this\u2019ll be hanging over my head forever.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHave I ever told you that you\u2019re fucking weird?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOnce or twice.\u201d Lance pulls out an antiseptic wipe. \u201cHold still.\u201d\n\n\nKeith sucks in a sharp breath when the cold, wet fabric touches his exposed skin. It stings like hell and he grits his teeth. \n\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Lance murmurs. \n\n\nHis fingertips brush over Keith\u2019s side and Keith hopes to high heavens he won\u2019t notice the goosebumps breaking out over him, which he probably will because they\u2019re everywhere. But then again, Lance is an idiot. And Keith hates himself for actually enjoying this. There are more important things to be concerned with, but Lance is so close and he\u2019s touching his naked torso and shit, Keith never thought he\u2019d be in this situation, ever. He was not prepared for feelings about Lance to suddenly assault him, and now of all times. \n\n\nLance seems to take his sweet time wiping down the cut and bandaging it. Keith watches the way he focuses closely on what he\u2019s doing, brow furrowed and gaze glued to his hands, with a hot face and a chant of he is not cute he is not cute he is UGLY playing in his mind. \n\n\nWhen he ties off the bandage and draws back, Keith is almost disappointed. Almost. \n\n\n\u201cThere,\u201d Lance says, looking quite pleased with himself. \u201cI think you\u2019ll live.\u201d\n\n\nKeith rolls his eyes and pulls his shirt back down. \u201cWhat would I ever do without you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d be really lonely right now, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHmph.\u201d Keith\u2019s about to dismiss the comment (however true it might be) before he notices the sag around Lance\u2019s eyes and the odd tightness to his mouth. And that\u2019s, well\u2026that\u2019s not normal. He doubts it can be attributed to physical pain alone, either. \n\n\nOh, great. He regrets the words before they\u2019re even out of his mouth. \u201cI\u2026I am glad you\u2019re here, Lance.\u201d\n\n\nThe blue paladin\u2019s eyes widen marginally as color rushes to his cheeks. His head snaps up and he scratches the back of it, a motion Keith has come to learn means he\u2019s feeling uncomfortable. \u201cYeah, well\u2026I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here too. I was\u2014I was really scared when I first woke up and Blue had no power and I couldn\u2019t get in touch with anyone.\u201d\n\n\nThe thought of Lance being stuck here, injured and alone, makes Keith feel kind of sick. I\u2019m glad I\u2019m here for you, he thinks, and wishes he could find it in himself to say it aloud. Damn. He\u2019s really not good with all this sappy, emotional stuff. He was in the same position in the castleship not too long ago when he\u2019d run to Lance\u2019s side and watched him smile bravely and speak his heart despite being gravely injured and in pain. Keith could only reply with a smile then, and he can only reply with a smile now. \n\n\n\u201cThanks, Keith.\u201d\n\n\nThat makes him pause. He looks at Lance quizzically. \u201cFor what?\u201d\n\n\nLance\u2019s face is blazing now. \u201cFor\u2026taking care of me. I couldn\u2019t\u2026I don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done if you weren\u2019t here.\u201d\n\n\nKeith\u2019s heart flutters uncomfortably in his chest. This\u2014this is what he finds so endearing about Lance. It must be. That underneath that self-assured, cocky facade, he\u2019s uncertain and sincere and so, so kind. Underneath his flaws is the kind of character that Keith\u2019s always wished he had. He doesn\u2019t get many glimpses of it, but he must have seen just enough to make him care more than he ever wanted to about this stupid, lanky boy. \n\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Keith says, trying desperately not to let on how warm he\u2019s feeling. \u201cIt\u2019s the least I can do for a teammate, yeah?\u201d Teammate. Yeah, sure.\n\n\nLance gives a short laugh and looks down at his lap. \u201cSo\u2026I told you something. Just before the crash.\u201d\n\n\nKeith tilts his head. \u201cDid you?\u201d\n\n\nThe blue paladin\u2019s eyes flicker between Keith\u2019s face and his hands uncertainly. He shuffles a bit and clears his throat. \u201cI guess you don\u2019t remember. That\u2019s okay. It wasn\u2019t\u2026important.\u201d\n\n\nKeith thinks back. Honestly, the most he remembers before the crash was flashing lights and wailing alarms and spinning and screaming and chaos. But\u2026he does remember Lance saying something. He\u2019s remembered it before, but he thought there was no possible way he could be remembering it right. The more he concentrates now, though, the clearer he can hear Lance\u2019s voice cutting through the pandemonium. He\u2019d said\u2014\n\n\nOh, god.\n\n\n\u201cYou said you would kiss me, if we made it out alive.\u201d\n\n\nLance is blushing to his ears, but he nods and meets Keith\u2019s eyes. \u201cYeah. And we\u2019re alive.\u201d\n\n\nKeith is breathing hard, now, and his stomach starts turning somersaults in his gut. \u201cI\u2019d say that\u2019s pretty important.\u201d \n\n\nAnd before he can lose his nerve, he leans in. One hand curves around the back of Lance\u2019s neck to draw him closer. He sees Lance\u2019s eyes flutter closed right before their lips press together firmly. It\u2019s a sloppy kiss, desperate and eager, but nothing has ever set Keith on fire like this before. He hadn\u2019t realized just how hungry he\u2019d been for physical contact. And judging from the way Lance is kissing him back, he feels the same way. \n\n\nThey\u2019re anchored to each other in this moment, both physically and emotionally. Twenty-four hours ago, Keith might\u2019ve gagged if he\u2019d known he would ever have to rely on Lance for anything. But now he can\u2019t think of anyone he\u2019d rather be stranded with, and he wants to be close to him. \n\n\nHe\u2019d be lying if he said he\u2019d never thought about kissing Lance before. He\u2019d never thought seriously about it, of course, because that would have been stupid. But when he had thought about it, he\u2019d imagined their first to be slow and gentle, unsure and experimental, the way first kisses usually are. He should\u2019ve known better. There is nothing slow and gentle about this. It\u2019s not aggressive, really, but it is hungry, and passionate. Like they\u2019ve both been waiting for this for so long that they can\u2019t hold back. There\u2019s a lot more tongue and teeth and saliva than Keith would have thought. He chalks the way he grabs at Lance\u2019s face and neck and arms up to the fear that\u2019s been sitting under his skin since he woke up from the crash, the need for reassurance and comfort. The kind he\u2019s been wanting to give to Lance. \n\n\nThey pull back when one of Lance\u2019s hands grabs his ribcage and accidentally presses on the tender bruising there. Keith instinctively backs up and gasps in pain.\n\n\n\u201cOh, shit, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Lance says, breathless and wincing. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Keith says, panting for air. \n\n\n\u201cI ruined it\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLance, it\u2019s okay.\u201d He cups the back of the taller boy\u2019s head and draws it forward until their foreheads are pressed together. \u201cYou didn\u2019t\u2014ruin it, I\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cUm.\u201d Lance\u2019s eyes, up close, are dazzling, especially when his pupils are blown so wide that Keith can see stars in them. \u201cI\u2019ve\u2026been wanting to do that for a while.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCould\u2019a fooled me.\u201d\n\n\nLance laughs. His entire mouth is wet. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Was that\u2026okay? I mean\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Keith nods a little. \u201cYeah, it was\u2014good.\u201d\n\n\nThe other boy lets out a loud sigh. \u201cOh, man.\u201d Then he pulls Keith forward and wraps his long arms around his shoulders tightly. \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve never actually hated you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s good to know.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI might think I do, sometimes, but I\u2026I don\u2019t.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re such a romantic.\u201d\n\n\nLance\u2019s back shudders as he laughs. \u201cI\u2019m really scared, Keith.\u201d\n\n\nKeith breathes out, long and slow, and winds his arms around Lance\u2019s waist. \u201cMe too. But we\u2019ll\u2014we\u2019ll be okay.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes I do. We\u2019ve got a universe to protect. We\u2019re too important to die here.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd you call me arrogant.\u201d\n\n\nKeith squeezes him and draws back. Lance looks shaky, but he\u2019s still smiling despite the terror in his eyes. Keith smiles back, reassuring and confident. \u201cYou are arrogant.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, so are you.\u201d\n\n\nHis heart isn\u2019t in it, but the fact that he\u2019s back to arguing is comforting. Keith leans forward to kiss him again, quick but meaningful. \u201cYou know, you scared me earlier. But if we\u2019re back to insults now, I guess that means you\u2019re going to be okay.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOf course I\u2019m going to be okay.\u201d This time, he\u2019s the one that leans forward to kiss Keith. \n\n\nWhen they pull back, Keith places a hand on his chest. \u201cWe should probably get to sleep.\u201d\n\n\nLance nods, a bit reluctant and a bit relieved. If Keith\u2019s feeling this worn out, he can only imagine how exhausted Lance must be. \n\n\nHe rolls out the sleeping bags from the emergency packs and arranges them next to one another by the fire.\n\n\n\u201cWhy two?\u201d Lance asks. \n\n\nKeith unzips one. \u201cOne for each of us, stupid.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t\u2026I don\u2019t know, share?\u201d\n\n\nHe makes a face. \u201cNo. You smell.\u201d\n\n\nLance gives an offended noise. \u201cYou just made out with me!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how I know you smell.\u201d With a sigh, he sits back and rests an arm on his knee. \u201cLook, we\u2019re both injured, and you\u2019re probably one of those people who move around a lot in your sleep. I don\u2019t want you to hurt yourself.\u201d\n\n\nAnd just like that, the irritation melts off Lance\u2019s face and is replaced by a corny grin. \u201cAw, you\u2019re worried about me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cYes, you are.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLance, get in your sleeping bag and go to sleep.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOkay, okay. Jeez.\u201d\n\n\nKeith ends up having to help him get his leg situated inside. He really is concerned about Lance jostling it in his sleep, but there\u2019s not much he can do. Once he\u2019s settled, he crawls into his own bed and zips up the flap. \n\n\n\u201cGoodnight, Keith,\u201d Lance says, smiling over at him childishly. \n\n\nKeith rolls his eyes at the dorky expression. \u201cGoodnight, Lance.\u201d He closes his eyes, looking forward to getting some sleep after such a rough day.\n\n\nUntil Lance clears his throat. \n\n\n\u201cUm. Keith?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCan we, like\u2026hold hands?\u201d\n\n\nKeith\u2019s eyes fly open. \u201cHold hands?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI, uh\u2026\u201d \n\n\nWhen he looks over, Lance is red again, which he thinks is a bit ridiculous since they just spent so much time locking lips, but there\u2019s something else. Something that reminds Keith of a small child, asking his parents to sleep in their bed during a thunderstorm. \n\n\n\u201cI just would\u2014I think I\u2019d feel better. If we did. But if you don\u2019t want to\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s\u2026\u201d Great, now Keith is blushing again, too. This is utterly ridiculous. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\n\nAnd so he reaches out and his fingers find Lance\u2019s, calloused and spindly. They twine together, and Keith won\u2019t admit that he instantly feels better like this, too. \n\n\n\u201cGoodnight, Keith.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGoodnight, Lance.\u201d\n\n\nKeith falls asleep with hope in his chest and the sense that everything really will be okay. They\u2019ll find the rest of their team, and eventually they\u2019ll save the entire universe. It\u2019s all stemming from the warm hand that\u2019s wrapped around his. They\u2019re scared, but they\u2019ll make it. \n"
