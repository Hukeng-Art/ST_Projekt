    "text": "Stiles\u2019 face takes up most of the screen, but there\u2019s still enough room around the edges that it\u2019s clear he\u2019s in his bedroom, which is lit with the watery grey light of dawn. His eyes are bloodshot, wild, and his whole face twitches several times before he starts to speak.\n\u201cHey, Dad,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cThis is, um. So. I have to\u2014I\u2019m leaving. For a while. And I thought I\u2019d videotape this instead of leaving a note so you\u2019d know that I wasn\u2019t being, like, held at gunpoint or something, because I\u2019m not. It\u2019s just me. Leaving. I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ll be gone. But you called Aunt Rose, and Dad, I\u2019m really sorry but there is no way I\u2019m going back there, I\u2014\u201d\nStiles stops. He takes in two careful, slow breaths before he continues.\n\u201cI\u2019m leaving my phone behind, so you can get on a cheaper plan. All State called\u2014they\u2019re scrapping the Jeep. I think they\u2019re sending a check in the mail? So. Yay? Make sure you take your meds. Stay away from bacon. Have fun with Melissa on Friday night. Um.\u201d\nStiles\u2019 eyes flick to the right, and then down, before finally going back to the camera.\n\u201cI love you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTheir road trip has been very quiet.\nIt\u2019s not that Derek\u2019s a talker. It\u2019s not that his last road trips\u2014the six months he and Laura took to make it to New York, and the two days he spent racing back to Beacon Hills after her death\u2014had been particularly filled with conversation. It\u2019s not even that he thought Cora would fill the silence with aimless chatter. He doesn\u2019t know what he thought, exactly, except that when he thinks back, way back, he remembers road trips filled with sing-alongs and Mad Libs and very short-lived games of Who Can Be Quiet the Longest.\nHe still doesn\u2019t know where Cora was all these years. She hasn\u2019t said.\n(Maybe she\u2019s waiting on Derek to make the first move for that, too.)\nBut Cora, while quiet, isn\u2019t cold. She might even be happy, although it\u2019s hard for Derek to adjust to the idea that a happy Cora isn\u2019t a Cora running around the house yelling \u201cPretend I\u2019m a horse, pretend I\u2019m a horse, \u2018kay? Neeeiighh!\u201d She\u2019s smiling more than she did in Beacon Hills, at least. That\u2019s something.\nShe might be getting tired of Chinese food, though.\n\u201cWe could get pizza tomorrow,\u201d Derek offers, breaking the silence.\nCora opens her mouth to reply, but closes it as a car whips past them and leaves billows of red dust in its wake. Derek does his best to shield the bag of food, and blinks his eyes clear in time to see her shrug.\nHe coughs to clear his throat of the dust, debates, and then says, \u201cDo you still only like cheese?\u201d\n\u201cI like whatever,\u201d Cora answers.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Derek says, after a beat. \u201cSure.\u201d\nHe glances up at the motel to check their progress. They\u2019re almost back. He feels vaguely sad about that; their daily trip down the road for dinner is the most exciting thing they do all day.\nThey move from the dirt path beside the road onto the pavement of the parking lot, which is still scorching hot despite the fact that the sun is almost set. Part of him wishes that they\u2019d stayed at an actual hotel, somewhere in town, but he likes the quiet on the outskirts of town too much, and swamp coolers make the air smell better than air conditioning units do.\nHe\u2019s fishing in his pocket for the key to the room, gratefully stepping into the shade of the awning, Cora trailing behind him, when out of the corner of his eye he spots a figure on the other side of their Toyota.\nIt takes a moment for the scent to register, probably because the last thing Derek is expecting to find in the middle of the desert is a gaunt Stiles Stilinski propped against the shady side of their Toyota, lacrosse bag stuffed full and tucked under his butt. His head keeps tipping forward and then jerking back up, like he\u2019s just barely keeping himself from falling asleep despite the wickedly hot metal of the car.\nDerek is a second away from dismissing it as a heat-induced hallucination, because seriously, when Cora says, \u201cOh. My. God.\u201d\nWhich basically nips that idea in the bud.\nStiles jerks and springs up, tripping over his lacrosse bag and smacking his hand against the side mirror of the Toyota when he flails. His shirt moves oddly, pooling into hollows that weren\u2019t there when Derek last saw him. \u201cShit\u2014Derek! Cora! Hi!\u201d\n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d Cora demands.\n\u201cSitting,\u201d Stiles shoots back. \u201cIs that a crime?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Cora says.\n\u201cYeah, well\u2014it\u2019s not,\u201d Stiles says.\nCora looks unimpressed. \u201cGo home, kid.\u201d\n\u201cMake me,\u201d Stiles challenges, like an idiot.\nDerek just barely gets a hand out in time to stop Cora from advancing.\n\u201cWhat are you doing here, Stiles?\u201d he sighs, as Cora gleefully bares her teeth.\n\u201cUh,\u201d says Stiles, looking unsure of which Hale he should be paying attention to. \u201cPossibly. Crashing your road trip?\u201d\nOf course he is.\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re not,\u201d Cora says immediately. \u201cThis is Derek\u2019s road trip, okay, not an excuse for you to have a stupid adventure. Go home.\u201d\n\u201cFuck off, nobody asked you,\u201d Stiles snaps.\n\u201cNobody asked you to be here in the first place,\u201d Cora fires back.\n\u201cYeah, well, I think if it\u2019s Derek\u2019s road trip, then Derek should be the one talking, shouldn\u2019t he?\u201d Stiles says.\nAnd suddenly both Cora and Stiles are glaring at him, and all Derek wants to say is that it\u2019s really not his road trip and he wishes Cora would stop saying that. It was Cora who had wanted to go; Derek had just wanted to keep her happy.\nClearly, Stiles\u2019 presence is making her unhappy.\nOn the other hand, Stiles is exactly the type of person who would corral everyone else into playing Mad Libs on a long car ride.\n\u201cI believe it\u2019s called loitering,\u201d he tells them, and turns toward the door to their room, key in hand. \u201cAnd it is a crime. Both of you get inside.\u201d\n\u00a0\nDerek pours half of his wonton soup into the ice bucket, surrenders two of the egg rolls, hands Stiles a spoon and sets the bag of shrimp chips between them. Cora doesn\u2019t give him so much as a piece of broccoli, despite the fact that she\u2019s been quietly hating Chinese food since Tuesday. Stiles looks skinny enough that one meal isn\u2019t going to make a difference, anyway.\nThey eat in silence. Cora hasn\u2019t known Stiles long, but she definitely knows that he\u2019s doing two things wrong already: he\u2019s not talking, and he\u2019s not eating like pig.\nDerek hesitates. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like it\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Stiles mumbles, hurriedly stuffing a shrimp chip in his mouth.\nCora grabs the remote and flips on the TV. The first shot is of an Amish woman and Harrison Ford. She scowls and pushes the UP button until it lands on the Food Network; they\u2019re making something with steak tips and corn that looks fucking delicious.\nDerek glances at it, then at her, and then resolutely focuses on his soup.\nCora mechanically stuffs hunks of chicken into her mouth.\nThe third time Stiles picks up a dumpling and then lets it plop back into the ice bucket, Cora dumps her food on the bed and grabs Derek by the arm.\n\u201cCan we talk for a minute?\u201d she grits out, though Derek is already allowing her drag him up and toward the bathroom. She spares a glance at Stiles as they leave. \u201cDon\u2019t touch my food.\u201d\nStiles rolls his eyes.\nCora shuts the door behind them, flips on the bathroom fan, and then pauses to check on Stiles but through the noise of the fan and the television, she can\u2019t hear him. She turns to Derek.\n\u201cCan you hear\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI can hear whatever you can hear,\u201d Derek reminds her. He glances ruefully at the fan behind his head. \u201cProbably less.\u201d\nRight. Her fault.\nShe swallows, musters her fury, and says, \u201cHe is not staying.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you liked him,\u201d Derek says, like that is actually the issue.\n\u201cI tolerated him. Barely.\u201d She studies her brother\u2019s face, but she hasn\u2019t relearned it well enough yet. \u201cLook. You can\u2019t tell me that you want him to be here.\u201d\nDerek shrugs.\n\"Do you want him here?\u201d Cora asks. \u201cHe\u2019s an asshole. He\u2019s going to cost money and demand we go places and entertain him\u2014he\u2019s going to treat this like a vacation, Derek.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that what this was supposed to be?\u201d Derek asks.\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s\u2014\u201d Cora takes a breath for patience. \u201cDerek, he wants to use you. That\u2019s not okay.\u201d\nDerek rolls his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s Stiles. He just needs a little help.\u201d\n\u201cLike that Jennifer bitch needed a little help?\u201d Cora asks, eyebrows raising just as Derek\u2019s face shuts down.\nDammit.\n\u201cYou have to stop helping people, Derek,\u201d Cora insists.\n\u201cI helped you,\u201d Derek says stubbornly.\nShe looks away and grits her teeth. She tries to listen again for Stiles, but all she can hear is the damned Food Channel.\n\u201cWhy are you so against this?\u201d Derek asks her, frowning.\n\u201cWhy are you for this?\u201d Cora demands, whipping back to face him. \u201cYou don\u2019t even like him! He\u2019s not your pack. He\u2019s not anything, he\u2019s just some stupid kid that\u2019s going to\u2014\u201d\nDerek\u2019s face is, impossibly, shutting down even further.\nCora changes tactics, her brain scrambling for something, anything.\n\u201cHow do you think he found us?\u201d she asks. \u201cHm? How did\u2014do you think his father knows he\u2019s gone? Scott? What\u2019s gonna happen when they follow Stiles here and discover that he\u2019s hiding out with us? I\u2019ll tell you what, Derek, they\u2019re going to think we kidnapped him across state lines and that\u2019s a federal crime. Did you think of that?\u201d\nFrom the expression on his face, Derek had not.\n\u201cThey take kidnapping really seriously in the US,\u201d Cora continues. \u201cYou\u2019ll go to prison for years. You\u2014\u201d\nThere\u2019s a tapping on the bathroom door, and she and Derek both jump about a foot in the air.\n\"Uh, guys? Just FYI, no one\u2019s gonna go to prison for kidnapping me, okay? For one, that would only count if you were the ones to transport me across state lines, which you definitely weren\u2019t. Also, even if my dad wanted to find me, he couldn\u2019t.\u201d\nCora glares mutinously at the door.\n\u201cJust saying,\u201d Stiles adds.\n\u00a0\nStiles sits on the edge of the bed. Cora very subtly stands in front of the door.\nDerek, after a moment of deliberation, sits down on the edge of the bed as well. It\u2019s exactly as close as he needs to be to hear Stiles\u2019 heartbeat, and also, it\u2019s been long enough that it\u2019s sort of nice to see Stiles again. So nice it sort of takes him by surprise, because, well, it\u2019s Stiles. He doesn\u2019t like it.\nFor a very quick moment he longs to be an Alpha again so he could be sitting across the room right now. Just for a moment.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d says Stiles. He looks at his hands, which are twisting in his lap. \u201cOkay. I left my phone at home and all my money\u2019s in cash. I have my computer, but it doesn\u2019t have Lo-Jack or anything and I\u2019m not going to turn it on. But more importantly, it\u2019s\u2014my dad needs some space right now. He\u2019s not going to go after me.\u201d\n\u201cReally,\u201d Derek says flatly.\nStiles\u2019 heartbeat is steady, but he can\u2019t imagine a world in which the Sheriff wouldn\u2019t go after his runaway son.\n\u201cIf he\u2019s not going after you, then why all the precautions?\u201d Cora asks.\n\u201cScott,\u201d Stiles says, and after a beat, \u201cand Danny.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been planning this,\u201d Derek says.\nStiles shrugs, grinning a little. \u201cI plan everything, dude. I am the master of procrastinating productively.\u201d\nCora is scowling.\nDerek doesn\u2019t know what to do. He should, as a reasonable adult, put Stiles on the next bus back to Beacon Hills. Stiles isn\u2019t like them. He has a father who loves him and a pack that find him useful.\nStiles seems to sense his indecision.\n\u201cListen, I\u2019m sorry that I\u2019m crashing your road trip,\u201d he says, slumping a little. \u201cBut my dad was going to send me away, all right, and I just\u2014wanted to make my own choice about it. You guys get that, right?\u201d\n\u201cWhat, that even your own father doesn\u2019t want you?\u201d Cora asks. \u201cYeah, I thi\u2014\u201d\n\u201cCora,\u201d Derek says sharply.\n\u201cLet me stay a week,\u201d Stiles begs. \u201cPlease. You guys have been in this motel for four days, you\u2019re clearly not going anywhere. I\u2019ll sleep on the floor, and pay for my own food. I\u2019ll be quiet. I\u2019ll give you money for the room.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know how long we\u2019ve\u2014\u201d Derek starts to ask, eyes narrowed, when his phone vibrates with a new text message. He stops, pulls his phone out, and sighs when he sees the sender.\n\nSorry to bother you dude but weird question, you haven\u2019t heard from Stiles right?\n\nDerek looks up at Stiles, eyebrows raised. \u201cIt\u2019s Scott,\u201d he says.\n\u201cOne week,\u201d Stiles pleads. \u201cJust give me one week.\u201d\nOut of the three people in the room, Derek is pretty sure he is not the one who should be making this decision. Stiles looks ready to cry and Cora looks ready to bite his head off, but Derek could really care less about the outcome. What does it matter if Stiles stays? The stakes are Derek\u2019s general level of annoyance for the next few days\u2014if that. There are no lives in the balance, here.\nExcept, maybe Stiles\u2019 life is. Maybe running away from home is the worst possible thing he could do for himself, the thing that will set him on a course of self-destruction that will end in a sad, lonely death, and it will all be Derek\u2019s fault. Or, maybe, running away from home will be what ends up saving Stiles from that.\nOr maybe it\u2019s neither, and it\u2019s just a few days of Stiles being annoying and Cora being tetchy, and five years from now none of them will even remember it.\nNo. Sorry, Derek texts Scott.\n\u201cOne week,\u201d he tells Stiles, and prays this won\u2019t end in death.\n\u00a0\nAs the bus rolled over mile after mile of pavement, taking Stiles away from Beacon Hills, he\u2019d felt the cords around his heart loosen. By the time he\u2019d made it to the dusty town Derek and Cora were staying in, he could actually feel his heart beating in his chest for the first time in weeks. The cold, silent hole was gone. Stiles had been cautiously optimistic.\n\n(\u201cIt\u2019s only for a little while,\u201d Dad tells him, pulling him from Mrs. McCall\u2019s bed. He\u2019s in his deputy uniform and he\u2019s got a bottle of whiskey in one hand. \u201cDo you remember your aunt Rose? She\u2019s coming to pick you up. \u00a0It\u2019s like an adventure. Like Sam Gribley.\u201d\n\n\nMr. and Mrs. McCall are screaming at each other, somewhere else in the house.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re my Frightful,\u201d Stiles whispers to little Scott, who\u2019s hiding under the bed.\n\n\nScott lifts his dark mop of hair to reveal blood-red eyes and a mangled peregrine falcon in his mouth.\n\n\nDad shoves him down the hallway. \u201cIt\u2019s only for a little while. You have to be brave for your dad. He loves you very much, but he\u2019s going through a hard time and he can\u2019t take care of you right now. Can you be brave for him, Stiles?\u201d\n\n\nThey come to the stairs.\n\n\n\u201cBe a hero, Stiles.\u201d\n\n\nThen he\u2019s falling down the stairs\u2014he remembers his father pushing him\u2014and he\u2019s tumbling, banging, it\u2019s all so dark, and he knows, he knows, he knows that when he opens his eyes he\u2019s going to see Gerard\u2014)\n\nHe wakes up on the floor of the Motel 6, heart pounding so hard he thinks it might break through his chest.\n\u00a0\nThe noises Stiles makes during his nightmare wake Derek long before he feels the cautious poke at his arm. The acrid stench of bile and sweat and tears is nearly overwhelming now that Stiles is looming over him. He makes a face at it, because it\u2019s fuck o\u2019clock in the morning and Stiles\u2019 puny human eyes won\u2019t see it anyway.\nHe grunts in response to the poke.\n\u201cDerek?\u201d Stiles whispers.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going for a walk.\u201d\nDerek sighs. Very quietly.\nStiles bites his lip. \u201cJust\u2014don\u2019t leave. Or something. I\u2019m coming back. Unless I\u2019m not back by noon, because then you should definitely go find my body.\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d Derek grunts, when Stiles continues to hover over him.\n\u201c\u2019Kay,\u201d says Stiles. \u201cThanks.\u201d\nDerek rolls over and buries his face in his pillow, which he promptly regrets, because even after four nights here the pillows still smell disgusting. A second later, he hears Stiles trip and brain himself on wall trying to find the door.\nThis is definitely going to end in death.\n\u00a0\nDerek doles out Pop Tarts and Milk Chugs from the vending machine for breakfast. Stiles tries to give Derek money for it, but Derek just stares at him until he puts it back in his pocket. Cora can\u2019t believe she\u2019s related to such a dumbass.\nAfter breakfast, she pulls out her book of word searches and Derek pulls out whatever douchey novel he\u2019s reading this week, and they settle in.\nStiles lasts an impressive thirty minutes.\n\u201cIs this, uh, what you guys normally do?\u201d he asks, sounding almost hesitant about breaking the silence.\nCora scowls at him.\nDerek, the fucking moron, looks amused. \u201cI thought you were going to be quiet?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I will, just\u2014I didn\u2019t know if this was what you guys normally did, or if you were hanging around the room for me. Or something. Because if you are, you don\u2019t\u2026 have to?\u201d Stiles all but mumbles.\n\u201cNot everything\u2019s about you,\u201d Cora says sourly.\n\u201cThis is what we do,\u201d Derek tells him, and goes back to his book.\nStiles blinks. \u201cOh.\u201d\nAnd that\u2019s it. He goes back to staring listlessly at the wall.\n\u201cYou got a problem with that?\u201d Cora demands, inexplicably irritated.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles says.\n\u201cLiar.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well\u2026\u201d Stiles trails off, and there\u2019s a tired pause before he eventually adds, \u201cYour\u2014face is a liar.\u201d\n\u201cSeriously?\u201d Cora asks, eyebrow raised.\nThe corners of Stiles\u2019 mouth twitch. \u201cI thought it would go over better than a \u2018your mom\u2019 joke.\u201d\nCora snarls, and Stiles flinches back a satisfactory six inches.\n\u201cChildren, behave,\u201d Derek says, not looking up from his book.\nCora pulls her teeth back in, scowling, and goes back to her word search. She viciously circles the backwards LATVIA she found right before Stiles started being annoying. More annoying.\nOn the floor, Stiles pulls his hood up over his head and curls into a ball between their beds.\n\u00a0\nLife on Derek and Cora\u2019s Excellent Adventure is not\u2026 adventurous. It\u2019s quiet. For the first time in his life, Stiles kind of likes that. He ends up borrowing a book from Derek\u2014who is apparently an avid reader\u2014and spends most of his first day with them reading and napping and feeling his muscles slowly relax. He does wish they weren\u2019t in the desert, though, so he could go walking when it wasn\u2019t night time, but they are and there\u2019s no way he\u2019s walking any distance in that heat.\nThe highlight of the day seems to be the dinner run. It\u2019s ungodly hot outside when they set off, even though the sun is almost half-set, but Stiles gets the feeling that if he doesn\u2019t go with them he\u2019s not going to eat.\nOn the bright side, it turns out that the sunset is crazy beautiful in the desert.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Stiles says eventually, and takes in a deep breath. \u201cDerek. Thanks for the book, dude.\u201d\nDerek glances at him. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t take you for the type to read LGBT books,\u201d Stiles continues. He hadn\u2019t even bothered to read the back cover of The Mysteries of Pittsburgh, so boy had he been surprised when Arthur had suddenly started dating a man. There was even a sex scene. A butt sex scene.\n\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Derek says, quirking an eyebrow at him. \u201cI just read books.\u201d\nStiles rolls his eyes. \u201cReal deep, Derek.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to share my books with you,\u201d Derek says.\n\u201cSee,\u201d Stiles says, a hesitant grin coming onto his face, \u201cI don\u2019t even know if that\u2019s a good thing or a bad thing, because your book stash is all books I\u2019ve never even heard of.\u201d\n\u201cI would be surprised if you had,\u201d Derek says.\n\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re a total book hipster,\u201d Cora pipes up, out of nowhere.\nDerek looks at her in surprise. \u201cNo,\u201d he eventually says, with a hint of a smile. \u201cI have eclectic tastes.\u201d\n\u201cHipster,\u201d Cora retorts.\nA car zooms past, and Stiles\u2014who learned his lesson yesterday, walking to the motel\u2014holds his breath and shuts his eyes, walking resolutely forward through the dust cloud. But he misjudges the curve of the road and stumbles into the rise of pavement.\nA hand catches his arm before he goes flying into the street, yanking him upright. His sneaker pulls away from the pavement coated in sticky black residue.\n\u201cGross,\u201d Stiles says, staring at the melted asphalt in fascination. Then he looks up at Derek. \u201cUh. I mean, thanks.\u201d\nDerek shrugs.\n\u201cSo, what\u2019s for dinner?\u201d Stiles asks eventually.\n\u201cPizza?\u201d Derek says, looking to Cora.\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d says Cora.\n\u201cWe can get cheese,\u201d Derek tries.\nCora shrugs.\n\u201cCheese is cool,\u201d Stiles says after while, though Derek hadn\u2019t ever looked to him for his opinion.\n\u00a0\nStiles wakes him up for the second night in a row with his whimpers. Derek always wakes up when other people are having nightmares. It\u2019s one of his least favorite things about himself, aside from his rabbit teeth and his tendency to fall for serial killers.\nJust like last night, Stiles eventually pokes him.\n\u201cDerek. I\u2019m going out again.\u201d\nDerek is too uncoordinated from sleep to facepalm, so he just throws an arm over his eyes instead. \u201cIs this going to be a nightly thing?\u201d\nStiles doesn\u2019t say anything for a minute. \u201cSorry,\u201d he eventually mumbles.\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t go walking around the desert at night,\u201d Derek tells him, feeling inspired to say something adult-like in the face of Stiles\u2019 uncharacteristic apology.\n\u201cWhat, you think I\u2019m gonna get mugged?\u201d\n\u201cI think you\u2019re going to step on a nest of scorpions and die,\u201d Derek replies.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Stiles says, and when Derek doesn\u2019t reply, he leaves. He doesn\u2019t trip over anything this time.\nDerek can\u2019t go back to sleep for a long time.\n\u00a0\nThere are four phone numbers in Cora\u2019s phone: Derek\u2019s, Boyd\u2019s, Scott\u2019s, and AT&amp;T Tech Support. She used to have Uncle Peter\u2019s, too, until Derek explained why everyone hated him nowadays.\n(She can\u2019t bring herself to delete Boyd\u2019s number, even though he\u2019s dead and somebody else is using his number now. She tried calling it the night of the lunar eclipse when Derek wouldn\u2019t wake up and Cora had felt like she couldn\u2019t breathe. She hasn\u2019t called it since.)\nIt had only been days after her rescue from the bank vault that Derek had taken her in to the store and told her to pick any phone in the store. She\u2019d deliberately picked the most expensive one there. The old Derek would have taken her into a headlock until she cried for mercy or until Laura broke it up and told Derek off for beating up their baby sister\u2014but this new Derek just nodded and signed a two-year contract for her.\nThe plan has international texting. Cora bets that if she promised to stay in touch, Derek would let her keep the phone.\nThen again, Cora bets that even if she didn\u2019t promise to stay in touch, if she took off in the middle of the night without so much as a farewell, Derek would keep paying for the phone. He\u2019s pathetic like that, now. Sometimes it\u2019s all she can do to stop herself from grabbing him by the shoulders and shaking him. She learned how to be alone. Why can\u2019t he?\nShe\u2019s so fucking bored. She misses the estancia, and her horses, and when she only had the energy to do one word search a day.\nShe\u2019s so very, very, very fucking bored.\n\u00a0\nWhen Stiles wakes Derek up the next night, Derek surprises the hell out of him by rolling out of bed and grumbling quietly as he shoves his feet into his boots. They\u2019re quiet as they wander through the desert, Derek occasionally pulling Stiles away from various deadly creatures hidden by the darkness (or so he claims).\n\u201cWhat are you going to do about school?\u201d Derek asks, after a long while.\n\"Summer school,\u201d Stiles answers. \u201cOr maybe I won\u2019t have to. School\u2019s been a total shit show, since, you know, half a dozen of our teachers are dead now.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Derek deadpans.\n\u201cActually,\u201d Stiles continues, after they walk a while longer, \u201cif you\u2019re looking for someone new to date, I\u2019m pretty sure no one would miss Se\u00f1ora Himmelfarb\u2014ow!\u201d\n\u201cMosquito,\u201d Derek says.\n\u00a0\n\"Can I have your old crossword puzzles?\u201d Stiles asks her on the fourth day of his invasion, after another sad lunch from the vending machine. \u201cThe ones that you\u2019re done with, I mean.\u201d\nCora narrows her eyes. \u201cWhy.\u201d\n\u201c\u2019Cause I like to look for the words they accidentally put in the puzzle,\u201d Stiles says, shrugging. \u201cIt\u2019s more challenging that way.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot,\u201d Cora tells him.\nStiles grins, because her brother has clearly already ruined him. \u201cSo, can I?\u201d\nAnd she\u2019s about to say yes, because what the hell, when she realizes that she\u2019s actually enjoying this.\n\u201cNo,\u201d she says, scowling at him. \u201cGo read your book.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n\u201cShut. Up.\u201d\nShe glares at him until he reluctantly returns to Embassytown.\nCora has no idea what the book is about, but she\u2019ll probably find out when they walk to dinner tonight. Stiles and Derek have taken to discussing the books he\u2019s reading then, if only for a few minutes. And she thinks the whole \u2018nighttime stroll\u2019 business is also becoming a habit for them. And this morning, when Stiles was curling up on the floor to take one of his naps, Derek had snapped at him to \u201cJust use the bed, Stiles, you look pathetic.\u201d\nStiles is insinuating himself, and it\u2019s pissing her off.\nShe scowls down at her crossword puzzle and starts to look for BOJANGLES (should be easy, there\u2019s a J), when suddenly Stiles closes his book with a snap.\n\u201cYou know what? No,\u201d he says.\nOh, joy.\n\u201cThis is stupid,\u201d Stiles announces. \u201cYou\u2019re both stupid. Actually, no, that\u2019s not my point\u2014my point is that you\u2019re both miserable, and for some reason you don\u2019t seem to care. Every day here is the same. Neither of you are happy. It\u2019s bizarre. And stupid.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not stupid,\u201d Cora says haughtily.\n\u201cReally,\u201d Stiles says, looking unimpressed. \u201cYou\u2019re going to tell me that you\u2019re actually happy here? Neither of you are silently wasting away on your beds every day?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Cora says stubbornly.\n\u201cStiles,\u201d Derek breaks in, looking gratifyingly annoyed. \u201cWe\u2019re fine.\u201d\nStiles flails. \u201cOh my God, aren\u2019t the two of you walking lie-detectors? How is this shit flying? Why are you both such martyrs?\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re unhappy, go home,\u201d Cora suggests.\nStiles stares at her disbelievingly, and Cora resists the urge to eat his face off.\n\"Okay,\u201d Stiles says, visibly centering himself. \u201cOkay. Derek. Would you be unhappy if we packed up and got on the road? No, no, don\u2019t look at Cora, this isn\u2019t about Cora.\u201d\nDerek shrugs.\nStiles turns to Cora, eyebrows raised. \u201cCora. Would you be unhappy?\u201d\nCora shrugs.\nStiles throws his hands up. \u201cDo you not see the problem here?\u201d\nDerek hesitantly looks at Cora. \u201cWe could\u2026 try somewhere else?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Cora snaps, throwing her word search book down. \u201cNo, we are not going anywhere else. We\u2019re just fine here.\u201d\nShe stands, jams her feet into her sneakers, and marches toward the door.\n\u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n\u201cGo home, Stilinski.\u201d\n\u00a0\nCora doesn\u2019t come back for hours. Derek is restless and twitchy, irrationally pissed at Stiles, and when Cora finally stomps back into the motel room Derek understands why his mother had slapped him across the face for running away as a child. But if he\u2019d expected Stiles to be apologetic, he\u2019s not. Stiles goes to dinner by himself, because Cora says she isn\u2019t hungry and Derek doesn\u2019t want to leave her alone in the motel room, and he brings back a veritable feast of Indian food.\nIt\u2019s the first time anyone has ever passive-aggressively eaten at him.\nWhen Stiles goes to bed, curled up on the floor between their two beds, Cora descends upon him.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d she says, tugging at his arm. \u201cOr do you only take nighttime desert walks with Stiles, now?\u201d\nDerek glares at her, before glancing at the sleeping Stiles. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t leave him alone. Or\u2014we should leave a note.\u201d\nCora stews as Derek writes out a message on the back of a receipt and then leaves it carefully next to Stiles\u2019 head, along with his phone so Stiles can call Cora\u2019s if there\u2019s trouble. Just in case. Stiles is exactly the type of idiot who would wake up alone and run out into the desert to try to find them.\nWhen they walk, Cora doesn\u2019t immediately speak. Derek wants to break the silence to ask Cora if she\u2019s jealous, or when she started hating Stiles, but he\u2019s pretty sure neither of those questions would go over well.\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t let him guilt you into doing things,\u201d Cora says eventually.\nDerek is thrown, and it takes him a few seconds to object with an incredulous, \u201cThat\u2019s not what he\u2019s doing.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Cora allows. \u201cBut, Derek, this road trip is about you. What he was spouting off earlier about me being unhappy, that was bullshit, okay\u2014I don\u2019t know what the hell Stilinski cares anyway. He\u2019s never given a shit about either of us before we were suddenly in charge of his entertainment.\u201d\n\u201cCora\u2014\u201d Derek hesitates. He almost always says the wrong thing and all he wants in the world is to not drive Cora away. But he has to say it. He can\u2019t keep it inside any longer. \u201cCora, the road trip isn\u2019t about me, all right?\u201d\nCora stops and stares at him. \u201cYes it is.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s about us,\u201d Derek says. \u201cYou and me. Stiles showed up, yeah, but I\u2014what I want is\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Cora says flatly.\nDerek doesn\u2019t know what to do with that. He doesn\u2019t even want to start with that.\n\u201cDo you\u2026 want get on the road again?\u201d he asks instead, after a long pause and some quiet swallows.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about what I want, Derek,\u201d Cora protests.\nDerek hates it when Stiles is right.\n\u201cFirst thing tomorrow,\u201d he sighs, \u201cwe\u2019re pulling out the map and picking a highway to follow.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\n(\u201cWhere\u2019s my dad?\u201d Stiles demands, craning his head back.\n\n\nTara towers over him, hollow eye sockets staring straight ahead, a hand on either of his shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019s only for a little while. You have to be brave for your dad. He loves you very much, but he\u2019s going through a hard time and he can\u2019t take care of you right now. Can you be brave for him, Stiles?\u201d\n\n\nThe sheriff\u2019s badge glints on her chest. It\u2019s crushed and dripping with blood.\n\n\nShe\u2019s the one who killed him.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only for a little while,\u201d Tara repeats, and pushes Stiles down under the water.)\n\n\u00a0\nAfter a long discussion that mostly involves Stiles having opinions he isn\u2019t entitled to, they decide to head north. Derek goes to gas up the Toyota, leaving her and Stiles alone to pack up the motel room. It\u2019s blessedly quiet for a whole ten minutes before, of course, Stiles has to open his mouth. Cora bets he can\u2019t wait to start rubbing it in her face that he was right.\nBut no. That isn\u2019t it.\n\u201cAre you jealous?\u201d Stiles asks. \u201cIs that why you suddenly hate me, because you think I\u2019m, like, poaching on your territory?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Cora says.\n\u201cBecause seriously,\u201d Stiles goes on, apparently impervious to her scowl now, \u201cyou had like six weeks on your own to bond with your brother, and\u2014\u201d\n\u201cListen, Stilinski, I hate you because my brother is on this road trip to get away from people using him, and you are ruining that,\u201d Cora snaps. \u201cBack the fuck off and let him heal.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m ruining it?\u201d Stiles asks incredulously. \u201cExactly what do you think you\u2019re going to do to him when you take off in a week, or a month, or whenever it is that you\u2019re planning to leave him?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not leaving,\u201d she says stiffly, even though she is. She was. She wants to.\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d Stiles says.\nCora wants to punch him.\n\u201cIf you tell Derek\u2014\u201d she threatens.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to,\u201d Stiles says quickly, jerking back. \u201cI won\u2019t, oh my God, put the teeth away!\u201d\nShe\u2019s tempted to hurt him\u2014to throw him around, dig her claws in, pound it into him that he will keep this secret\u2014but she reels herself in and settles for a snarl.\n\u201cHoly crap,\u201d Stiles breathes.\nCora lets out a slow breath. She wants to demand to know how he knew she was leaving, and how he knew that she and Derek were miserable here, and how he knew where to find them in the first place, how he seems to know everything. But she\u2019s not willing to give the little shit that much credit.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go home?\u201d she demands instead, and when he opens his mouth she cuts him off. \u201cNo, I mean it, Stilinski. What the hell\u2019s got you so scared? You faced down a pack of psycho Alphas and an evil druid chick and you didn\u2019t even think of running. So what\u2019s so bad there now that\u2019s got you running?\u201d\n\u201cZombies,\u201d Stiles says petulantly.\n\u201cOh, I see. So that\u2019s what\u2019s been making you cry in your sleep every night?\u201d she asks.\nStiles sucks in a breath.\n\u201cAt least when I leave Derek,\u201d Cora says acidly, \u201cI won\u2019t be leaving behind a family member, or a packmate, or even a friend. Derek and I are nothing to each other. It would take a real selfish son to a bitch to leave all those behind.\u201d She stares at him pointedly. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cFuck off. You don\u2019t know the first thing, you don\u2019t know\u2014you don\u2019t know anything,\u201d Stiles says, chest heaving. \u201cAnd if you think you\u2019re nothing to Derek, you\u2019re a fucking dumbass, because Derek looks at you like you\u2019re the center of the goddamn universe, all the time\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDerek is nothing to me,\u201d Cora spits, claws flying out, vision flashing red, \u201cand whatever horseshit dreams he has about being a family again, they\u2019re not my problem.\u201d\nStiles gapes at her.\nEven Cora can\u2019t believe she said it out loud. She\u2019s been thinking it since day one but it sounds uglier hanging in the air than it ever did in her head. Worse is the way that Stiles is still staring.\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t even,\u201d she says hotly, forcing her claws back in. \u201cLike you ever gave a flying fuck about either of us, back in Beacon Hills.\u201d\n\u201cUh, excuse me?\u201d Stiles says, flailing. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re looking at the dude who saved your life, right here.\u201d\nCora bares her teeth, advancing. \u201cYou took a bath, Stilinski. Derek saved my life.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, no, I definitely gave you CPR while we were hiding out in an ambulance. These lips? Life-savers. Literally. And don\u2019t even get me started on the number of times I\u2019ve saved your brother\u2019s ass.\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d she grits out, taking another step forward. \u201cFine. So I owe you, too. What do you want? Money? You wanna fuck me? I have it on good authority that a werewolf\u2019s vag is\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOh my God, no, what the hell,\u201d Stiles says, wide-eyed, tripping over himself in his effort to move backwards. \u201cWhat the hellis wrong with you?\u201d\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Cora snarls.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Stiles says incredulously. \u201cBut, you know, if you\u2019re following through with that logic, you\u2019re either gonna have to sex up Scott\u2019s mom or take her on a road trip, too, because she totally restarted your heart when Dad and I brought you in to the hospital.\u201d\nShe is so done with this.\n\"Just\u2014shut up, Stilinski. God, you're such a child,\" she breathes, grabbing a shirt and furiously shoving it back into her duffle bag. \"Such a fucking child.\"\n\"We're the same age,\" Stiles retorts.\nCora snorts. \"We're really not.\"\nStiles makes a frustrated sound through his teeth, but takes his anger out on his clothes, violently packing up the rest of his things in silence. Cora zips the main compartment of her bag shut and disappears into the bathroom to grab her toiletries. When she comes out, Stiles is packing up Derek's things. Her anger abruptly fizzles out, leaving behind only the sickly taste of jealousy.\n\u00a0\nFor the first time in days, Stiles feels restless. He doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s because they\u2019re finally in a car and going somewhere, or if it\u2019s just an unlucky coincidence, but either way, he thanks his lucky stars that the Toyota is almost as much of a gas-guzzler as his Jeep was. The books are no longer doing it for him, and he keeps feeling the itch to turn on his computer. Which would be bad. So to distract himself, Stiles buys a handheld fishing game and fifty-pack of AA batteries at the first gas station they stop at.\nThe device is shaped like a real fishing rod handle, with the spinny thing on the side and everything. It even has cool sound effects\u2014though Stiles only gets to use them for about two seconds before both Derek and Cora are threatening to leave him on the roadside if he doesn\u2019t mute it.\nAt the next gas station, Stiles finds a racing game (\u201cFor Ages 5+\u201d) that\u2019s in the shape of a real steering wheel. He buys that, too.\n\u201cYou look like you should be in a car seat,\u201d Cora says waspishly, glaring at him from the front seat.\n\u201cI look like someone having fun,\u201d Stiles replies, jerking his little red wheel to the left as he encounters a sharp turn on the race track. He\u2019s not quick enough. His little racer spins out, and the wheel vibrates as he donuts over rumble strips.\nThe game actually is challenging, because the wheel isn\u2019t the most responsive, but that just means it\u2019ll be all the more satisfying when Stiles finally wins.\nHe restarts the race, this time prepared for the sharp turn at the end of the course, but he hasn\u2019t even gotten halfway through the first lap when his concentration is broken by Derek\u2019s phone ringing.\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t answer your phone while you\u2019re driving,\u201d Stiles remarks, as Derek fishes it out of his pocket with one hand.\n\u201cWerewolf,\u201d Derek replies, and brings the phone up to his ear. \u201cHello?\u201d\nStiles rolls his eyes, and makes a mental note to get Derek one of those I drive like a Cullen bumper stickers. He turns back to his game, in last place now, only to hear\u2014\n\u201cStiles. It\u2019s for you.\u201d\nHis head shoots up. \u201cW-what?\u201d\nDerek stares at him via the rear view mirror. \u201cIt\u2019s for you.\u201d\nStiles forces himself to breathe. He wonders if Derek and Cora can hear his heartbeat, wonders if hearts get louder when they get faster or if that's just how it seems when it's your own heart inside your own chest. Stiles can hear his heart beating. And if Stiles can hear his heartbeat with his puny human ears, won't the werewolves be able to hear it?\nHe forces another breath. \"Who is it?\"\nDerek doesn't answer. He just holds the phone out, eyes on the road.\nStiles realizes that he's still gripping the toy steering wheel. When he releases it, his hands start to tremble.\nDerek's phone is heavy and expensive in his hand. Stiles\u2019 own phone is\u2014was plastic. Cheap. After the one he'd smashed in the gas explosion\u2014his third phone in eight months\u2014Stiles hadn't had the money or the optimism to buy another nice one. Derek\u2019s phone, on the other hand, definitely cost a pretty penny. Stiles wonders if Derek is really that optimistic, or if he somehow has a lot of money to drop on phones. Neither seems likely. It's probably just another example of Derek being perpetually hopeless at long-term planning.\nHe finds it weirdly endearing, actually.\nBut. Right. The phone.\n\"Hello?\" Stiles says, feeling faintly sick.\n\"Stiles.\u201d\nStiles chokes on air, not sure if it\u2019s in relief or terror. \"Uh\u2014Lydia. Hey?\"\n\"It's been five days,\" Lydia says crisply. \"I thought you at least would have checked in.\"\n\"N-no,\" Stiles says. \"I mean, yes! No, wait. I\u2014\"\nIt hits him, then, the only reason that Lydia would be calling.\n\"What's wrong?\" he demands, heart suddenly in his throat. Images flash through his mind. Dad. Scott. Mrs. McCall. Allison.\n\u201cYou mean besides the fact that you disappeared into the night and haven\u2019t sent us so much as a text message since?\u201d\nStiles swallows. \u201cSo\u2014so no one\u2019s hurt? Everyone\u2019s okay?\u201d\nLydia sighs. \u201cYes, Stiles. Beacon Hills is still standing. Everyone\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d he says, though his heart is still pounding madly. He doesn\u2019t quite believe that. \u201cReally?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Lydia says emphatically. \u201cNow, tell me about you.\u201d\n\u201cMy dad\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIs fine. Tell me about you, Stiles. Are you feeling better?\u201d\nStiles looks down at his jeans. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Been fine. Who said I wasn\u2019t fine?\u201d\nSilence.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles admits, eventually. He\u2019s speaking quietly, even though there\u2019s no point. Derek and Cora will hear every word of this conversation. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014I think I\u2019m out of range. Or something. It\u2019s not as bad, out here.\u201d\n\u201cI know I didn\u2019t say anything,\u201d Lydia says carefully, after another long pause, \u201cbut I did notice. I know what psychological torture looks like, Stiles.\u201d\nStiles doesn\u2019t say anything to that.\n\u201cI just thought\u2014\u201d Lydia starts to say, but then cuts herself off with a frustrated huff. \u201cNo. Never mind.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? No, Lydia, this is so not your fault,\u201d Stiles says immediately, sitting up straight. \u201cOne hundred percent not you. I left a note, I thought you guys would see\u2014it wasn\u2019t because of you, or Scott or Isaac or anyone, okay? It was my\u2014I was\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Lydia says firmly. \u201cTell me more about you.\u201d\nStiles exhales, recognizing a wall when he sees one. \u201cFine. But there\u2019s not\u2026 much to say.\u201d He casts around for a bit. \u201cDid you know that Derek\u2019s a book hipster?\u201d\nCora snorts. Derek sighs.\nThat\u2019s what they get for being nosy assholes.\n\u201cJust because he reads something other than comic books doesn\u2019t make him a book hipster, Stiles,\u201d Lydia says archly.\nStiles smiles slightly. \u201cThey\u2019re graphic novels, and you know it. Also, two words: Nicholas Sparks.\u201d\n\u201cAt least those are actual books,\u201d Lydia retorts.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re just snot rags in disguise,\u201d Stiles says.\nLydia sniffs. \u201cPlease. Have you ever even read one of his books?\u201d\n\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d Stiles snorts.\n\u201cBoys,\u201d Lydia sighs. \u201cBut\u2014you sound better, Stiles.\u201d\nStiles swallows. \u201cHow did you know I was with\u2014where I was? Does everyone know?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just me. And I guessed you\u2019d gone to Derek because I knew you\u2019d been keeping tabs on him since\u2014\u201d\n\"Lydia,\u201d Stiles hisses, face flaming. His eyes go frantically to the front seat, where Derek is now staring at him with raised eyebrows in the rear view mirror.\n\u201cYes. Well, I have to go,\u201d she says breezily. \u201cI want regular updates from now on. At least every other day. Understand?\u201d\n\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d\n\u201cI will full-name you, Stiles,\u201d Lydia warns.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know my full name,\u201d Stiles scoffs.\n\u201cOh? So it\u2019s not Mel\u2014\u201d\nStiles hangs up.\n\u201cTabs?\u201d Derek asks.\nCora\u2019s turned around, watching him intently.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles says, deflating. \u201cUh. Derek. Remember how you used my computer to set up your new phone after your old one died a sad, watery death in the school pool?\u201d\n\u201cYou stalked him?\u201d Cora demands.\nStiles exhales. \u201cOkay, firstly, your brother has kind of written the manual on stalking. Maybe you weren\u2019t aware. Secondly, I did not stalk you. It didn\u2019t even occur to me until you guys took off, and even then I just\u2026 checked up on you. Once or twice.\u201d\n\u201cFreak,\u201d Cora mutters, turning around, but it\u2019s not as vitriolic as Stiles had expected.\n\u201cI\u2019m changing the password,\u201d Derek sighs. \u201cAnd give me my phone back.\u201d\nStiles hands it over and settles back into his seat. The phone call comes crushing down on him, hard and fast.\nFuck.\nHe should have pressed Lydia for information about his father. At least to hear that he was eating okay, and happy with Melissa. If his father missed him. He should have told Lydia that it wasn\u2019t her fault he left, that it was just his stupid ADHD brain making him more susceptible to the Nemeton than Allison and Scott. She should know better than that. It\u2019s always Stiles\u2019 stupid ADHD that\u2019s fucking things up. Fuck, he should have asked about Lydia.\n\u201cHey, Stilinski,\u201d Cora says.\nStiles looks up glumly.\n\u201cWhat is your first name, anyway?\u201d she asks.\nStiles snorts. \u201cHah. Sorry. Scott and my dad are the only people in the world who know it.\u201d\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be that bad,\u201d Cora prods.\n\u201cOh yes it can,\u201d Stiles says.\nCora gives him a skeptical look, but doesn\u2019t press.\nStiles sighs, then forcefully pushes the phone call from his mind and grabs his racing game. This time, he makes the left turn.\n\u00a0\nThey finally stop for the night in Big Arm, Montana. Cora keeps seeing signs for Wild Horse Island State Park, and it makes her ache for her girls back home. She wonders if Derek remembers her childhood obsession with Marguerite Henry. He used to tease her about it relentlessly.\nThe motel is built to look like a log cabin. There are moose on the bedspreads and the soap dispenser is in the shape of a black bear. It also shares a parking lot with a Denny\u2019s, open twenty-four hours, so they grab an extremely late dinner there before crashing in the room. Or, at least, Stiles crashes. Cora waits until he drifts off, curled up on the floor between the two beds, then pulls Derek out for another late-night walk.\nDerek follows along silently, after he leaves his phone and a note for Stiles.\nShe walks toward the lake, the lake with the island with the horses, but doesn\u2019t force the conversation. She doesn\u2019t have anything in particular to say. She just\u2014wants to be out here, with Derek.\n\u201cYou\u2026 okay?\u201d Derek asks tentatively, after a long while. They\u2019ve reached the shore by then, and are walking among the trees, following the lake south.\nShe nods.\n\u201cWe told Stiles a week,\u201d Derek says, after another long while.\n\u201cYou told Stiles a week,\u201d Cora corrects, before she can stop herself.\nDerek looks away.\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d she mutters. \u201cHe\u2019s not that bad. He can stay however long he wants. Who are we, his parents?\u201d\n\u201cNot that bad?\u201d Derek repeats incredulously.\n\u201cShut up,\u201d says Cora.\n\u201cUh-huh.\u201d\nShe whacks him on the arm and turns her gaze out to the lake, squinting. The moon is waxing, and she can see pretty well across the water, to where the island is. Derek doesn\u2019t ask her why she\u2019s suddenly changed her mind, but her conversation with Stiles this morning is rolling around her head anyway.\nIt\u2019s a long while before Cora finally feels settled enough to lead them back to their motel. When she buries herself under the moose bedspread, she falls asleep almost instantly.\n\u00a0\nAfter he gets back from his walk with Cora, Derek barely gets the chance to drift off before he hears the beginnings of a nightmare from Stiles. Resigning himself to not sleeping just yet, Derek rolls onto his stomach and casts a hand down, rooting around until he finds a shoulder, and then gives Stiles a rough shake.\nStiles jerks upright and gasps, pants harshly, and when Derek raises his head Stiles is staring at him with wide eyes.\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Stiles whispers, when he\u2019s calmed down.\nDerek takes in a deep breath, and tries not to sound too long-suffering when he asks, \u201cWalk?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles breathes. \u201cYeah, that\u2019d be great.\u201d\nSo Derek once more pushes away the exhaustion from driving fifteen hours, writes a note for Cora, puts on his boots, and at the last minute yanks his leather jacket out of his duffle bag. He shoves it at Stiles before he opens the door.\n\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d Stiles tells him, fingering his hoodie.\nNot even halfway across the parking lot, Stiles starts to shiver. For a moment Derek thinks about being an asshole and putting the jacket on\u2014three months, ago, he would have\u2014but now, he just holds it out and waits silently as Stiles puts it on.\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Stiles says, jamming his hands into the pockets. \u201cGuess I didn\u2019t really plan for Montana in November when I was packing.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did you pack for?\u201d Derek asks.\n\u201cGetting out.\u201d\nDerek hangs a right on the road, the direction that will take them away from the lake. It would be too weird to retrace the path he and Cora had taken with Stiles.\n\u201cI mean, like,\u201d Stiles continues eventually, \u201cI\u2019d totally done the research. It\u2019s kind of my hobby\u2014planning things, I mean. When I can\u2019t sleep or whatever. Like, I could give you a detailed description of how to go about becoming emancipated. Or what I would do to survive if a tsunami hit Beacon Hills. I planned how to run away years ago. But. When I thought \u2018pack for all varieties of weather\u2019, I guess I just thought\u2026 \u2018pack for all varieties of Californian weather\u2019. Kinda dumb, I guess.\u201d\n\u201cYou knew to leave your phone behind,\u201d Derek offers. \u201cTo take cash.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m a regular Jason Bourne,\u201d Stiles mutters. \u201cOnly with ADHD, for added fun times.\u201d\nDerek just barely keeps himself from looking over at Stiles. He has never, in ten months of knowing him, heard Stiles mention his ADHD. Derek only knew because he\u2019d made a comment back in June and Scott had gone off on him.\n\u201cWhat are you doing about Adderall?\u201d he asks instead. \u201cWhat\u2019s your plan for that?\u201d\n\u201cCan we just\u2014not talk about it?\u201d Stiles asks.\n\"You were the one who started rambling,\u201d Derek points out, rather shortly.\nStiles huffs. \u201cYeah, well. Let\u2019s talk about you, huh?\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s not,\u201d says Derek.\n\u201cNo, let\u2019s,\u201d Stiles insists. \u201cC\u2019mon, man. We\u2019ve been bonding and shit.\u201d\nDerek carefully inhales, then exhales. \u201cStiles.\u201d\n\u201cNo, dude, seriously. You\u2019re all quiet and literary and stuff out here, and at first I was like, \u2018Whoa, what universe did Bizarro!Derek step out of?\u2019\u2014well, no, first I was kind of a wreck and didn\u2019t even notice you being weird. But then I did. And now I don\u2019t know if the whole colossal asshole thing was just a Beacon Hills\u2026 thing, and this is what you\u2019re really like? Or if you\u2019re just switching the asshole off right now because you\u2019re recovering or whatever? Or\u2014or something else? Mega-confusing, dude.\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\u201cDuh.\u201d Stiles flaps a hand at him indignantly. \u201cOf course it does. You just had the most traumatizing two months\u2014nine months, really\u2014six years\u2014okay, so basically, you\u2019ve had the most traumatizing life in the history of ever, and we all thought, you know, you were going on this big Road Trip of Healing. That\u2019s how Scott sold it, anyway. And I\u2019m just saying, it seems like you\u2019re really\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about this.\u201d\nDerek hasn\u2019t wanted to examine the way he feels about Stiles, why he let him stay, why he\u2019s been going on these walks, why he feels the ever-increasing draw to protect, but right now it makes him sick. Stiles makes him sick. He can\u2019t take this, not now.\u00a0\n\u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n\u201cStiles, I am tired, and I am not doing this right now,\u201d Derek says, trembling and barely keeping it out of his voice. \u201cYou can either shut the hell up, or we\u2019re going back to the motel and I\u2019m going to bed. Which one is it going to be?\u201d\nHe can\u2019t even wait for the response. He just starts walking, strides long and furious.\n\u201cHey, hey, hey!\u201d Stiles says, jogging to catch up. \u201cOh my God, dramatic much? All you had to say was \u2018Stiles, be quiet.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cBe quiet,\u201d Derek orders.\n\u201cZzzppp,\u201d Stiles says, zipping his lips shut.\nDerek breathes deep, but it doesn\u2019t relax him. In fact, it takes him almost a mile before he finally starts to feel the tension ease, and it has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that that\u2019s just about when Stiles silently links their arms together.\n\u00a0\nThere\u2019s a weird, silent moment of communication with Stiles around six in the morning, when Cora raises her head and sees him handling Derek\u2019s phone. For a moment, she thinks he\u2019s stealing it, but then he sees her and pointedly turns the phone so that she can see it\u2019s on the alarm screen. He makes a show of turning the alarm off, putting the whole phone on silent, and then points to a sleeping Derek.\nShe nods, gets up and quietly closes the curtains, then lays back down to go to sleep.\nThey pass the morning silently. Stiles is reading another one of Derek\u2019s douchey books\u2014this one with a creepy lime-green eye on the cover. The title is too small for her to read from a distance, but whatever it is, it apparently requires turning the book upside down every other page. At one point, he takes a nap. Unlike his first few days, where he\u2019d slept at least half the day, Stiles has now weaned himself down to only a morning nap. Cora alternates between watching TV on mute with closed captioning and playing mindless games on her phone. Derek sleeps on, quiet and unmoving.\nShe doesn\u2019t like looking at Derek like this. It\u2019s fine when it\u2019s night and the room is dark, because then the situations are separate in her head, but right now all she can think of is what Derek looked like the day he had to go and save her life. He hadn\u2019t woken up for hours. She\u2019d had Peter whispering in her ear and no Boyd and the ever-preset knowledge that Derek might die because of her.\nCora owes Derek her life. She knows that. That\u2019s why she\u2019s here.\nBut does he have to lie so still?\nWhen noon passes by and Derek is still sleeping, Stiles mimes that he\u2019s going for food. She hands him a ten with a list of requests, including Derek\u2019s favorites. Stiles comes back with almost more food than he can carry, and a two-inch stack of brochures in one hand. Literally, it\u2019s two inches thick.\nThe floor space between their beds quickly becomes a mosaic of brochures, sorted into piles that make no sense to Cora.\nDerek finally wakes up around two, blinking muzzily at the Stiles and Cora. He has some truly spectacular bed-head going on.\n\u201cGood morning, Starshine,\u201d Stiles says.\nDerek grunts, rolls out of bed, and stumbles into the bathroom.\nCora glances at Stiles, who shrugs. She shrugs back. She\u2019s pretty sure this is actually a good thing, though she doesn\u2019t say that out loud. Once upon a time, when Derek would come down the stairs in the morning, Mom would always smile fondly and say, \u201cOh, look, the caveman lives,\u201d and Derek would grunt and glare, and everyone would laugh.\nThis is the first time since then that she\u2019s seen Derek do anything other than spring from bed, expression grim and muscles tense. So. It has to be a good thing. Right?\n\u00a0\nDerek comes out of the shower feeling loose and awake, which is unquestionably strange. Judging by the hopeful looks Cora and Stiles subtly give him when he comes back into the room, they definitely conspired about this. He hopes the cessation of hostilities isn\u2019t a temporary situation. It\u2019s kind of nice that they\u2019re getting along, even if he suspects that it\u2019s mostly out of apology.\nStiles has procured at least five dozen different pamphlets for things to do in the area, and it takes Derek a moment to remember the literal wall of them that had been in the motel\u2019s lobby.\n\u201cI take it we\u2019re staying here another day?\u201d Derek asks, as he studies the multitude of stacks Stiles has sorted them into.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so awesome here!\u201d Stiles says happily, looking up from his piles. \u201cI didn\u2019t know there were actually things to do in Montana, but they\u2019ve got, like, cherry picking and scenic drives where you can see glaciers, and snowshoeing.\u201d\n\u201cI think snowshoeing requires snow,\u201d Cora says dryly.\n\u201cAnd if you go hiking here, you have to watch out for bears and moose. Like, they actually cross the trails and stuff. Did you know they have pepper spray for bears? I wonder if it would work on werewolves. Oh my God, wait, wait, wait\u2014who would win in a fight, a werewolf or a bear?\u201d\n\u201cThe werewolf,\u201d Derek says, \u201cbecause he\u2019d feed his annoying human to the bear and then run away while it was distracted.\u201d\nStiles sticks his tongue out at him.\n\u201cWe got you lunch,\u201d Cora says, pointing to a pile of vending machine items on the table.\n\u201cI got you lunch,\u201d Stiles corrects.\n\u201cI paid,\u201d Cora says, rolling her eyes.\n\u201cYeah, with money from Derek\u2019s wallet.\u201d\nDerek tunes out their bickering and opens the bottle of cranapple juice.\nAn hour later, Stiles has persuaded them to drive up to Glacier National Park, mostly because Stiles wants to stand on a glacier (\u201cOr lick one! I\u2019d totally lick a glacier! It\u2019s got to be good luck, like the Blarney Stone!\u201d). Derek doesn\u2019t think that you can actually stand on glaciers, not without a helicopter or something, and he\u2019s pretty sure they\u2019re not something you\u2019d want to lick, but he\u2019s not going to be the one to crush Stiles\u2019 dreams.\n\u00a0\nWhen the seventh day dawns, Stiles doesn\u2019t say anything about going home. Neither do Derek or Cora. He spends the whole day on edge, until night falls and Cora mentions that Yellowstone would be a good place to spend the upcoming full moon, and Derek looks to Stiles to ask if he\u2019s okay with that.\nStiles is so, so okay with that.\nBefore they leave the next day, they stop at Goodwill. Derek donates the books that he and Stiles have read and buys a few new ones. Stiles finds a warm jacket of his own so he can stop stealing Derek\u2019s, and a massive binder of mix CD\u2019s with no track listings and totally nonsensical labels. There\u2019s one titled Lawrence of My Labia. Stiles needs to know what music is on that CD like he needs to breathe.\nCora buys The Complete Book of Baby Names, and when they get in the car, she joins him in the backseat.\n\u201cMy fishing game has a two-player mode,\u201d Stiles tells her, as Derek starts the car.\n\"Don\u2019t be an idiot. I\u2019m sitting this close so that I can hear your heartbeat,\u201d Cora says witheringly. Then she opens The Complete Book of Baby Names.\n\u201cAre you going to go through that whole book?\u201d Stiles asks, horrified.\n\u201cNo,\u201d says Cora. \u201cI heard Lydia say the first syllable. This shouldn\u2019t take long at all.\u201d\nStiles doubts his name is actually in there, but peers curiously at the pages as Cora flips to M. When she gets to the Mel section, Stiles catches a glimpse of where his name would be, alphabetically, but is luckily not.\nWhew.\n\u201cStiles,\u201d Cora says. \u201cIs your name\u2026 Melancton?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d says Stiles.\n\u201cMelanion?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cMelbourne?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nStiles also turns down Melchior, Melford, Mele, Melik, Melker, Melor, Melrose, Melun, Melville and Melvin, all with a steady heartbeat.\n\u201cIt has to be one of these,\u201d Cora says, scowling at him. \u201cWhat other Mel names are there?\u201d\n\u201cTold you it was bad,\u201d Stiles says smugly.\n(Though, he\u2019s not gonna lie, if he\u2019d been given any of the names Cora had just listed off, he\u2019d probably still go by Stiles. They\u2019re not as bad, but damn, they\u2019re still bad enough.)\n\u201cIt might not be M-E-L,\u201d Derek offers from the front. \u201cIt could have been Mal, Mil, Mol, or Mul. Cell phones distort sounds.\u201d\nCora brightens, and immediately starts flipping to a new section of her book.\n\u201cThanks, Derek,\u201d Stiles says sarcastically.\nDerek grins.\n\u00a0\nIt turns out that getting a motel at seven o\u2019clock in the evening near Yellowstone is easier said than done. It takes them over an hour to finally find one with a room, and the manager warns them that the room is booked the following night and he\u2019ll be double-charging them if they stay a minute past eleven. Derek doesn\u2019t trust himself to reply to that without losing the room, so he just takes the key with a nod.\nThe room is cold. Derek turns the heat on and hopes it\u2019ll warm up quickly.\nHe waits until after they\u2019ve eaten dinner and are walking home, Cora between them, before Derek says to Stiles, \u201cSo, you haven\u2019t talked to Lydia since she called on Monday.\u201d\nHe says it very casually, non-confrontationally. He\u2019s been working on it since they crossed into Wyoming, debating the merits of I-statements and waiting for the right time to bring it up.\n\"That was Monday?\u201d Stiles says, startled. \u201cOh. Yeah. I guess it was. Weird. How do people know what day it is when they\u2019re not in school? It\u2019s like they\u2019re all the same.\u201d\n\u201cI think you should call her,\u201d Derek says carefully. \u201cShe asked you to.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Stiles says.\nCora smacks him on the arm. \u201cCall her, dickface. She\u2019s worried about you.\u201d\nStiles snorts. \u201cOh, yeah. That\u2019s rich, coming from you.\u201d\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Cora snarls, jerking toward him, but Derek catches her wrist and pulls her back.\nStiles sticks out his tongue at her.\n\u201cI thought you two were getting along, now,\u201d Derek sighs, though mostly he\u2019d just been hoping.\n\u201cWe are,\u201d Cora says, \u201cwhen Stilinski isn\u2019t being an immature little asshole.\u201d\nStiles glares at her. \u201cI have a first name, you know.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Do you?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Stiles. Sti-les. Say it with me.\u201d\n\u201cUgh,\u201d Cora says, disgusted.\nStiles doesn\u2019t call Lydia.\nWhen they go to bed, the room is still cold despite the heater working at full blast, so Derek gives Stiles the comforter from his bed (these are thankfully plain green and moose-free, although Derek is dismayed to discover that the underneath it are fuzzy flannel sheets printed with little grizzly bears). Stiles looks at him in surprise for approximately half a second, before snatching the blanket and practically swaddling himself.\nOn their walk that night, following a nightmare from Stiles, Derek finds himself mumbling out before he can stop himself, \u201cYou really should call her.\u201d\nStiles sighs. \u201cReally, dude? You\u2019re Mr. Passive over everything on this trip, up to and including what toppings we get on our pizza, and this is the one thing you decide to push?\u201d\nDerek opens his mouth.\n\u201cDon\u2019t even deny it,\u201d Stiles snaps, glaring at him in the darkness. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re terrified that if you say you want pepperoni\u2014which I know you do, I know what you like on your pizza\u2014the pizza dude will accidentally chop off his hand in the middle of slicing it and bleed out on the floor of the kitchen. Newsflash: the pepperoni comes pre-sliced. You can ask for it. You won\u2019t accidentally kill anyone.\u201d\nDerek breathes through that for a few minutes, because he knew Stiles was an asshole when he started this conversation. All teenagers are. They\u2019re too wrapped up in self-discovery and their own invincibility to conceive of anything else.\nEventually, he sighs heavily and says, \u201cIf you call her, I\u2019ll let you listen to that stupid CD in the car. The Lawrence one you were bothering me about.\u201d\nStiles almost trips over his own feet. \u201cOh my God, really?\u201d\n\u201cOne track for every phone call,\u201d Derek says.\n\u201cHow about text messages?\u201d Stiles tries, after a beat.\n\u201cHow about if you don\u2019t call her, I\u2019ll snap the CD in half?\u201d Derek replies.\n\u201cYou\u2019re an asshole,\u201d Stiles complains.\nDerek raises an eyebrow at him, despite the fact that Stiles can\u2019t see it, and refrains from pointing out the obvious.\nEventually, Stiles groans and kicks at a pebble. \u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d\nDerek sighs.\n\u00a0\nCora calls Lydia that night, when Derek and Stiles are out.\n\u201cStiles?\u201d Lydia answers groggily, though it\u2019s only just past midnight back in California.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Cora,\u201d she says shortly. \u201cStilinski is being a little bitch about calling you. I thought you\u2019d appreciate knowing that he\u2019s alive.\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Lydia asks, her voice sharpening into something cold and hard.\n\u201cAlive,\u201d Cora repeats. \u201cOf the living. Not dead.\u201d\n\u201cYes, thank you, I heard. I was more concerned that you apparently feel qualified to call Stiles a \u2018little bitch\u2019, meaning not only that you are arrogant enough to judge someone else for the way that they cope and recover from extreme trauma, but also that you are under the delusion that applying the word \u2018bitch\u2019 to a man somehow strips it of its inherent misogyny.\u201d\nWell. Lydia sure wakes up fast.\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d Cora says, rolling her eyes. \u201cNext time I won\u2019t call.\u201d\n\u201cThe calls aren\u2019t for my benefit,\u201d Lydia says witheringly.\nCora scowls. \u201cAren\u2019t you\u2014he left you. He left everyone.\u201d\n\u201cHe had reasons.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about his dad?\u201d she challenges. \u201cIsn\u2019t he worried?\u201d\n\"His dad is drowning himself in alcohol and guilt.\u201d Lydia\u2019s tone is cool and clinical. \u201cThat isn\u2019t Stiles\u2019 fault, and it certainly isn\u2019t a reason for him to come running back, so don\u2019t you dare tell him.\u201d\nCora only met Mr. Stilinski for about thirty minutes, and she was pretty woozy for most of it, but she doesn\u2019t like the image that Lydia is painting. At the same time, though, it gives her a surprising amount of satisfaction. She doesn\u2019t like that either.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t he leave because of his dad?\u201d she asks.\n\u201cHe thinks he did,\u201d Lydia replies.\n\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Cora demands.\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Lydia says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware you cared about the \u2018little bitch\u2019.\u201d\nShe doesn\u2019t. She definitely doesn\u2019t.\n\"Well\u2014how come you\u2019re not mad?\u201d she asks, pressing onward. \u201cStiles left you. He just took off and left, abandoned all of you, and it\u2019s like you don\u2019t even care.\u201d\n\u201cI love Stiles,\u201d Lydia says plainly.\n\u201cExactly.\u201d\n\"No, you\u2019re not listening,\u201d Lydia says sharply. \u201cStiles is my friend and I love him, and I want what\u2019s best for him. Of course I was upset when he left, but what\u2019s more important is that he heals, and that he\u2019s happy.\u201d\nCora grits her teeth. \u201cBut how can\u2014\u201d\n\"This conversation is over,\u201d Lydia interrupts. \u201cUnlike you, I have school tomorrow, and need to sleep. Good night.\u201d\nShe hangs up before Cora can get in another word.\nCora scowls at the END CALL screen. She doesn\u2019t know why she\u2019d thought that would be anything other than a waste of time.\n\u00a0\nThe following morning, Stiles calls Lydia, only to remember when he gets her voicemail that it\u2019s Thursday and she\u2019s in school.\n\u201cI called!\u201d he protests, when Derek does not let him play the first track on Lawrence of My Labia anyway. \u201cYou said call. I called.\u201d\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t count,\u201d Derek replies.\n\u201cNo fair,\u201d Stiles whines.\n\u201cShut up, Stilinski,\u201d Cora says.\nStiles rolls his eyes. \u201cOh my God, can you say anything else?\u201d\nShe\u2019s been particularly grouchy this morning, reminiscent of their desert days, for no apparent reason. Maybe the upcoming full moon.\n\u201cShut up, or you\u2019re sleeping outside tonight,\u201d Cora replies.\nStiles is at least seventy-five percent sure that Derek wouldn\u2019t let her do that. Seventy percent sure. Stiles was kind of an asshole to him last night, possibly, so Derek might take some passive-aggressive revenge.\nBut, see, that\u2019s Stiles\u2019 whole point! The old Derek would have just ripped his throat out, or punched him, or at least shoved him to the ground last night. Bizarro!Derek is passive-aggressive. Not that Stiles wants to be punched or anything, but it\u2019s not\u2026 natural. Just because Derek\u2019s been hanging around quietly in the background while Stiles and Cora loudly and dramatically deal with their issues, doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s fine. If anything, Derek\u2019s the one who should being loudly and dramatically dealing with his issues. If issues were dollar bills, Stiles and Cora could retire comfortably at age seventeen. Derek could probably buy out NASA.\nOkay, that\u2019s probably hyperbole. But that doesn\u2019t mean he isn\u2019t right.\nStiles stews about this for the rest of the drive to their next motel, which unfortunately isn\u2019t very long, so he doesn\u2019t have nearly enough time to get himself worked up into a good old-fashioned strop.\nThey have their new motel room for three nights. It was the only one in the area that had a room open, and it was a single king bed instead of two queens like they had been getting, but three nights is more than enough time for the full moon to come and go, so all in all they got pretty lucky. Assuming Cora and Derek don\u2019t claw each other to death in their sleep or something.\nStiles is so glad he sleeps on the floor.\nDerek\u2019s phone doesn\u2019t get great service in the park, so it isn\u2019t until they\u2019re coming back into town for dinner that Lydia\u2019s missed call comes up on Derek\u2019s phone. Derek doesn\u2019t say anything, just passes the phone back to Stiles and turns into the parking lot of a pizza place.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a fancy pizza place\u2014and by fancy, Derek means the floor isn\u2019t sticky and the cups aren\u2019t plastic. He\u2019s not a pizza elitist. Laura had quickly adopted New York City cuisine snobbery, from the pizza to the bagels to the tap water, but the pickiest Derek will get is stating that if given the choice he\u2019d prefer a Chicago-style pizza to a New York-style.\n\u201cWooow,\u201d Stiles says, looking over the menu. \u201cWhat\u2019s reggianito?\u201d\n\u201cCheese. From Argentina,\u201d Cora says. She wrinkles her nose at the menu. \u201cEw, crab.\u201d\nStiles squints at the bottom of the menu. \u201cThey import their tuna. Who imports tuna?\u201d\nDerek wonders if there\u2019s anything this restaurant doesn\u2019t import, right before he sees the pizza with bison meat.\n\u201cThese are really weird pizzas,\u201d Stiles says, flipping the page.\n\u201cThey\u2019re are all douchey and gross-looking,\u201d Cora complains.\n\u201cWhat? No, we should try one!\u201d Stiles argues.\n\u201cYeah, let\u2019s spend money on food we\u2019ll probably hate,\u201d Cora says. \u201cGreat idea.\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to get one of the specialty ones\u2014we can build our own,\u201d Derek interjects, as he notices their server giving them a pained look from across the room. \u201cWe could just\u2026 get pepperoni.\u201d\nStiles perks up, and after a moment, grins tentatively at Derek.\nDerek feels a flush creeping up the back of his neck.\nBut then Cora butts in with a wrinkled nose and vehement, \u201cNo way. I hate pepperoni. Can we just get cheese?\u201d\nStiles glares at her. \u201cHey, if Derek wants to get pepperoni, you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Derek interrupts, staring at Cora.\nShe glares at him and looks back down at her menu, but Derek has been learning to read her and he knows she\u2019s pleased with herself.\n\u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n\u201cCheese is fine,\u201d Derek says firmly, unable to help the small smile tugging at the corners of his mouth.\nCora kicks his foot gently under the table.\nDerek kicks back.\nStiles sighs and slumps back in his seat. \u201cYou guys are so boring.\u201d\nEventually, Stiles leaves to go call Lydia back while they\u2019re waiting for the pizza to cook. Derek nudges Cora and says smugly, \u201cI knew you still only liked cheese.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Cora mutters.\nOutside, he can hear Stiles complaining to Lydia about unadventurous eaters, and it makes him grin even wider.\n\u00a0\nThe room only has one bed.\nAs they\u2019re changing into pajamas, Cora makes the executive decision that Stiles will not be spending the night on the floor. She remembers being relocated into the guest room with Derek and Laura whenever Dad\u2019s siblings would visit, the three of them squishing into the tiny queen bed for nights on end, Cora relegated to the middle because she was the youngest.\n\u201cStilinski,\u201d she barks, when Stiles comes out of the bathroom, jabbering on about the wolves that apparently live in Yellowstone, and whether Derek and Cora will commune with them during the full moon.\n\u201cI have a first name,\u201d he says.\n\u201cAnd if you tell me what it is, I\u2019d be happy to call you by it,\u201d Cora replies.\nStiles rolls his eyes. \u201cI bet I\u2019m even in your phone as Stilinski.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not in my phone, idiot,\u201d Cora says.\n\u201cWhat? Why not?\u201d Stiles looks betrayed.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t even have a phone anymore,\u201d Cora reminds him, irritated.\nStiles pauses, his face blanking. Then he blinks, visibly pulling himself back together. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cWell, if I get one again. You\u2019ll be getting my number.\u201d\nCora feels bad, which mostly pisses her off, but she tries to bite it down. \u201cSure. Whatever. You\u2019re sleeping in the bed, tonight.\u201d\nDerek turns his head to stare in time with Stiles. It\u2019s hard to say who looks more incredulous.\n\u201cDerek kicks,\u201d Cora says, shrugging.\n\u201cI kick people who snore in my ear,\u201d Derek retorts.\n\u201cI don\u2019t snore,\u201d Cora insists. \u201cAnd even if I did, it\u2019s no reason to kick me. So you can kick Stiles.\u201d\nDerek sighs.\n\u201cDo I get a say I this?\u201d Stiles asks.\n\u201cDo you want to sleep on the floor?\u201d Derek asks, raising his eyebrows at Stiles.\nStiles makes a face.\n\u201cAll right, then,\u201d Derek says.\nThey pile in, Derek closest to the door because he\u2019s a paranoid freak and always has to be in the bed closest to the door (as she\u2019d eventually figured out, after she\u2019d spent four nights in the bed closest to the door in a motel in Arizona and kept waking up to an increasingly sleep-deprived Derek). Cora rolls away from them both, facing the wall. Behind her, she can hear Derek and Stiles arranging themselves, Stiles\u2019 heart beat pounding fast in her ears.\n\u201cDude. If you kick me,\u201d Stiles whispers into the darkness, \u201cI\u2019m gonna kick you back.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to kick you.\u201d\n\u201cBut if you do\u2014\u201d\nGo to sleep, Stiles.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just saying\u2026\u201d\nCora kicks him.\n\u201cOw!\u201d\n\u201cShut. Up.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going back on the floor, if this is how I\u2019m going to be treated.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re going outside, if you don\u2019t shut your mouth.\u201d\nThere\u2019s shifting behind her, the dull thud of bone on bone, and then suddenly Stiles\u2019 heart is beating double-time. She wonders what her brother\u2019s done to him (smothering comes to mind), but whatever it is, it\u2019s shut him up, she\u2019s not going to roll over on the off chance that it gets him started again.\n\u00a0\nStiles wakes up in a tangle of werewolf limbs, morning wood fully engaged, and that\u2019s so radically different from how he\u2019s woken up for the past\u2026 ever\u2026 that it takes him a moment to realize that he\u2019s waking up and it\u2019s morning and he has only a vague memory of a nightmare last night that had ended in shushing and quiet murmurs and the feeling of safety.\nAnd, dude, erection. He hasn\u2019t had felt his dick stir in weeks.\nOf course the first time he\u2019s horny in two months, he\u2019s in cramped quarters with two werewolves. Ugh. His life.\nHe knows that he should try to force it down, think nasty thoughts and all that, but\u2014but it\u2019s like the first green sprout of life poking its way out of a volcano-ruined landscape. His body is saying, look, we\u2019re healing, there\u2019s life in here still! How could Stiles destroy that? It would be cruel.\nStiles disentangles himself from Derek, who has turned out to be quite the sleep-cuddler, and Cora, who starfishes and doesn\u2019t care who or what her limbs end up on top of, and stumbles off to the bathroom. He\u2019ll turn on the fan and get in the shower, and that\u2019s as much courtesy as the werewolves are getting this morning. Stiles has an orgasm to enjoy.\nIf he were older, he\u2019d probably be able to take his sweet time with it. He\u2019d really milk it, play with his balls, finger himself, bring himself to the edge and then back down three or four times, work his body into a dizzying fervor until he was simply overcome.\nBut Stiles is seventeen and hasn\u2019t masturbated in weeks. It takes him about three pulls before he\u2019s coming in long, white ropes that spatter against the shower wall with quiet thumps. As he comes, images of Derek\u2019s smile, the feel of Cora\u2019s leg between his thighs, the sharp sting of stubble burn on his neck against the hot water of the shower, fly though his mind.\nHe tries not to think about it, afterward.\nIt\u2019s not like Stiles hasn\u2019t masturbated to people he knows, before. It\u2019s not like he hasn\u2019t masturbated to thoughts of Derek, or Cora, before. So why does he feel so dirty right now?\nMaybe it\u2019s because they\u2019ve been so nice to him on this road trip, letting him know them in a way that makes objectification uncomfortable, now. It\u2019s what had happened with Lydia.\nMaybe it\u2019s because he thought of them both in the same session.\nMaybe it\u2019s because they\u2019re right outside the bathroom, and can probably hear him.\nStiles cups his hands together, collects water from the shower spray, and splashes it against the wall so it runs down and washes his come down to the bottom of the shower, and down the drain. He uses the motel-provided shampoo and conditioner, but steals some more of Derek\u2019s body wash, because using a bar of soap makes his skin feel tight and dry, and Derek has nice shower gel. He has nice hair products, too, but Stiles feels that using those might be crossing some sort of line.\nWhen he steps out of the shower, he realizes that in his erection-induced excitement he forgot to take today\u2019s clothes into the bathroom. He debates for a moment, but eventually decides to head out in a towel to fetch them and hope that Derek and Cora are still asleep.\nNo such luck.\nCora is waiting outside the bathroom, clothes in a bundle against her chest, and as soon as Stiles steps out she\u2019s shoving past him.\n\u201cNo, wait\u2014\u201d\nShe shuts the door.\nBalls.\nStiles turns around, clutching his towel, to see that Derek is also awake, sprawled out on the bed with one lazy eye cracked open to stare at him. His shirt has ridden up, displaying about two inches of his happy trail.\n\u201cMorning,\u201d Stiles says, knowing his face is heating.\nHe\u2019s getting hard again. Shit. Why had he been happy about regaining his ability to get aroused, again?\nDerek grunts and rolls over, planting his face into the pillow. The spot where Stiles had slept.\nStiles really needs to stop looking at Derek. He needs to not be hard. He needs to think of dead kittens, and Finstock in a bikini, and his dad\u2014\nHis dad.\nWell, that certainly does the trick. The wave of sickening guilt and sorrow that crashes over him at the thought of his father is so powerful that he almost physically flinches back from it. God, his dad. It\u2019s been creeping up more and more on his mind that maybe he was wrong, maybe he\u2019d jumped to conclusions, maybe he\u2019d\u2014\nHe can\u2019t think about that. If he starts thinking about it, he\u2019ll go back to Beacon Hills, and the thought of going back there\u2026\nNo. Just. No. \u00a0\nStiles changes his clothes mechanically, forcefully running through Fifty Nifty United States over and over in his head as he does.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nDerek doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s the full moon, or the fact that he had an almost-uninterrupted sleep last night, but when he eventually stumbles out of bed and starts to wake up in the shower, he realizes that he feels like running. Not away from or toward something. Actually, what he wants is to run with Stiles and Cora, and for a moment he wishes he could be an Alpha again so that he could make Stiles a wolf, so they really could all run together.\nNot that Stiles would agree to the bite.\nOr maybe he would, now. He\u2019s different than he was nine months ago, different even than he was before Derek left Beacon Hills. Derek could tell him that what had happened in Beacon Hills wasn\u2019t what it was really like to be a werewolf. It was better. Stiles could stay with him and Cora, on the road, pack, until they found some place to call ho\u2014\nBut it doesn\u2019t matter. Derek isn\u2019t an Alpha anymore.\nStiles wouldn\u2019t say yes, even if he was.\n\u00a0\nCora spends the first hour at Yellowstone trying not to hum Journey\u2019s Open Arms. It\u2019s all Derek\u2019s fault. The idiot apparently bribed Stiles into calling Lydia by promising Stiles a track of one of his stupid mix CD\u2019s for every time he called her, which Cora definitely would not have agreed to, and now she\u2019s stuck with the corniest love song of the eighties\u2014and that\u2019s saying something\u2014on repeat in her head.\nBut then Old Faithful goes off, shooting a good thirty meters into the sky, and even Cora can admit that\u2019s pretty fucking badass.\nThey\u2019re coming down off one of the boardwalks, into a trail that bisects a grassy valley, when out of nowhere Derek grabs both her and Stiles by the collar and yanks then to a stop.\nCora glares. Stiles gags and flails, and then opens his mouth to probably start on a diatribe about abuse of humans, but Derek claps a hand over his mouth and jerks his head to the left. They both turn to see a gigantic moose standing about twenty meters away, staring straight at them. Its antlers must be a meter and a half wide.\nOr maybe it\u2019s an elk. Or a caribou. Are they all the same thing? It\u2019s probably a moose.\n\u201cCool,\u201d Stiles breathes, when Derek lowers his hand.\n\u201cIt won\u2019t come closer,\u201d Derek says quietly. \u201cIt can sense that we\u2019re predators.\u201d\nWell, it can sense that Derek is a predator, anyway. Cora learned a long time ago how to not only quiet that part of her so she could work with The animals, back on the estancia, but how to call them to her.\nShe turns to Derek, a spark of excitement leaping in her chest, and says, \u201cStay here.\u201d\nThen she takes Stiles\u2019 hand and pulls him forward.\nThere\u2019s some silent communication between Stiles and Derek, where Stiles stumbles and looks back and Derek gives some nonverbal reply, but Cora isn\u2019t watching and all that matters is that in the end, Stiles follows her and Derek stays.\nThe moose watches them as they take slow, cautious steps forward. It\u2019s truly massive, with huge dark eyes and a fat belly that give it the illusion of stupid slowness. Cora\u2019s been to bull fights before. She knows better. And she\u2019s painfully aware of Stiles\u2019 hand gripping hers. But, she\u2019s spent the last five years hiding herself from animals she worked, lived, and occasionally slept in the stalls with, and she\u2019s confident that she can do this.\nThere\u2019s ten meters between them and the moose when she stops.\nI am not a predator, she thinks, breathing in air and willing herself to become like it. I am a friend. I am like you.\nMinutes pass in silence.\nCora is patient.\nThen Stiles\u2019 heartbeat kicks into overdrive, and the moose is moving toward them. Cora grins and squeezes Stiles\u2019 hand.\nIt\u2019s past mating season but too early for calving season, and while she doesn\u2019t think moose hibernate, they\u2019re at least preparing to settle in for a long, slow winter. From the easy gait the moose is taking, she bets moose are just as friendly as cows once you stop coming off as a predator. She\u2019s good with cows.\nThe moose stops a meter away from them.\nCora holds out a hand. The moose pauses, then leans forward to sniff it.\nStiles has stopped breathing.\nYeah, she\u2019s just showing off, now.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh my God,\u201d Stiles says, when they\u2019re safely back on the boardwalk. \u201cOh my God, that was not natural. You\u2019re like werewolf Snow White.\u201d\nCora looks pleased.\nDerek is frowning, arms crossed over his chest. \u201cHow did you do that?\u201d\n\u201cPractice,\u201d Cora says, and tugs his arm. \u201cCome on. Jealousy isn\u2019t a good look on you.\u201d\nDerek scowls.\nStiles is mostly just glad that he didn\u2019t get skewered.\nCora practically skips down the path, and Derek\u2019s scowl only lasts as long as it takes them to find Abyss Pool about a mile down the trail (though it comes back when Stiles leans what Derek considers to be \u2018too far\u2019 off the railing to get a better look at the depths of the pool). You\u2019d never know that the full moon was tonight, though. Not like you would with Scott. Maybe that\u2019s a thing with born werewolves, where they\u2019re less cranky? Or maybe Derek and Cora just have more experience?\nAlso, where Scott prefers to huddle inside with lots of snacks and video games for a full moon, Derek and Cora apparently like to go out and run around like actual wolves.\n\"Seriously?\u201d Stiles asks\u2014tries not to whine\u2014when Derek informs him that he\u2019ll be staying at the motel alone, tonight. \u201cI was joking when I said you guys should commune with the local wolf pack!\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to commune with wolves, Stilinski,\u201d Cora says, rolling her eyes.\n\u201cCora might,\u201d Derek allows, \u201cgiven how she was making friends with the elk earlier. But I won\u2019t be.\u201d\nCora slaps him on the arm. \u201cI wasn\u2019t making friends. And that was a moose.\u201d\n\u201cIt was an elk,\u201d Derek says.\n\u201cIt was definitely an elk,\u201d Stiles agrees. He holds up the animal safety brochures he\u2019d picked up. \u201cThere\u2019s a guide in here.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d Cora grouses. \u201cThe point is, neither of us are communing with wolves tonight. We\u2019re just going out to run. It\u2019s normal.\u201d\n\u201cNormal for\u2026 werewolves,\u201d Stiles says slowly. Deliberately.\n\u201cIt\u2019s normal for werewolves, in a pack, when they\u2019re not threatened,\u201d Derek explains. \u201cIt was\u2026 Beacon Hills was always too dangerous. When I was there.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d says Stiles. \u201cWe just had a big, awkward sleepover where Allison and Scott wouldn\u2019t look at each other, Isaac and Lydia had a catfight about the twins, and I got really, really drunk in the corner.\u201d\n\"You see why we run,\u201d Cora says dryly.\n\u201cYeah, but\u2014\u201d\nStiles stops, at a loss for how to put the awful feeling in the pit of his stomach into words.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll leave one of the phones with you,\u201d Derek says.\nStiles shrugs and tries for a smile. \u201cCool. Sure.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThey run for hours. Yellowstone is massive, more massive than any space than any space Derek has ever run in before, and it\u2019s incredible to not have to run in circles to keep to safe zones. The night air is cold and fresh, the scent of industry as faint as Derek\u2019s ever smelled, and Cora fights the same way she did when she was a pup.\nThere is a pack of wolves in Yellowstone, but they seem to sense that they\u2019d be beaten by werewolves, or maybe there\u2019s even other werewolves that run in Yellowstone sometimes. He sees a wolf or two out of the corner of his eye, watching from the shadows, but they don\u2019t engage. At least for tonight, this is Derek and Cora\u2019s territory.\nDerek runs hard and fast. He ran faster as an Alpha, but when he\u2019s going fast enough that his lungs are burning and his muscles ache, he can forget that. Cora pounces from behind and Derek throws himself into a roll, and they go down the slope of the valley together, Cora clinging to his back. They pick up more and more momentum, gravity powering their roll, until finally Derek hits her on a down-roll and springs up, free.\nCora rolls the rest of the way down, pushing herself up with a backflip when the ground evens out. Derek is already running past her, toward the icy river.\nThey hit it together, splashing down and bobbing back together like corks. Cora dunks him in seconds.\nDerek comes up laughing.\n\u00a0\nThey head back to the motel early, hours before dawn. Stiles is awake, wide-eyed, the television on, the bed scattered with The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner, his handheld games, Derek\u2019s phone, and the Bible that had come in one of the drawers of their motel room. He blinks a lot at them when they walk in.\n\u201cHey. Hi! You\u2019re back.\u201d\nCora strips her clothes, barely noticing the stiffness of frozen cloth as she does. Behind her, she can hear Derek doing the same.\nStiles stares, open-mouthed.\nThe moon is still singing in her veins as she slips into sweats and a t-shirt. She leaves her clothes on the floor to melt. It\u2019s not like the carpet isn\u2019t already stained. The television is too loud and bright, so she turns that off, then she starts picking things off of the bed.\n\"You guys\u2026 okay?\u201d Stiles asks.\nDerek switches off the lights. \u201cFine. Lay down.\u201d\n\u201cW-what?\u201d\nCora pushes him down, probably too hard, and crawls into bed beside him. She settles on her stomach, head facing the wall, but throws an arm over Stiles to keep him from popping back up. She hears Derek getting into bed on Stiles\u2019 other side, and then the bedcovers are coming up over them. It\u2019s warm. The bed smells like Stiles since he\u2019s been sitting here for so long.\nTheir last full moon, they\u2019d sat in a motel on the outskirts of Phoenix and stared at the walls. Cora had thought that it was too soon to ask Derek to run, thought maybe he wanted the quiet night in, and had sat in quiet misery instead. She thinks, now, that Derek was probably sitting there that whole night thinking the same thing about her.\n\u201cOoookay,\u201d says Stiles, between them.\nCora is already half asleep.\n\u00a0\nStiles sleeps through the night.\n\u00a0\nOn their final day in Yellowstone, Stiles drags them back to the park to see Old Faithful one last time. As they wait for it to go off\u2014Old Faithful is not as faithful as rumor would have it\u2014they argue over where to go next. Or, Cora and Stiles argue. Derek doesn\u2019t much care. When Cora finally sells Stiles on The Badlands, just in time for Old Faithful to go off, Derek can\u2019t help but notice that their trajectory is headed steadily further and further away from California.\nEver since Stiles showed up, Derek has been wrestling with the guilt of pulling Stiles away from his education, his family, his pack\u2014everything Derek had lost. Stiles was seventeen. He had no idea know what he was leaving behind.\nNow, Derek questions how he could possibly ever let Stiles go back.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDerek\u2014plural noun.\u201d\n\u201cTeeth.\u201d\n\u201cCora\u2014adjective.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026flatulent.\u201d\nDerek sighs, but Stiles actually giggles as he scribbles it down.\n\u201cOkay, Derek. Another adjective.\u201d\n\u201cImmature,\u201d Derek says, with a pointed look at Cora.\nCora sticks her tongue out at him.\n\u201cCora\u2014noun.\u201d\n\u201cPassive-aggressive older brothers.\u201d\nStile pauses. \u201cI\u2026 don\u2019t think that\u2019ll fit in the blank.\u201d\nCora smiles with all her teeth. \u201cWrite small.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Badlands are exactly as bad as Stiles predicted. They\u2019re flat and brown and the Things To Do brochure doesn\u2019t even unfold to a three-page leaflet. It\u2019s just the one panel. The main attraction seems to be a scenic drive around the park, and there\u2019s no way Stiles is suffering through that tomorrow without the opportunity to spread the misery a little, so when they settle into their motel for the night, Stiles goes outside to call Lydia.\n\u201cStiles,\u201d Lydia says, when she picks up.\nStiles inhales. \u201cHey, Lydia.\u201d\n\u201cHow are you?\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d Stiles says. He can see his breath in the night air when he says it. \u201cWe\u2019re at The Badlands, which is literally the worst place on earth.\u201d\n\u201cThe Badlands are an important source of American geological and paleontological research, Stiles,\u201d Lydia says primly.\n\u201cYeah, maybe, but that doesn\u2019t mean I want to vacation here. It\u2019d be like going on a vacation to CERN.\u201d\n\u201cPeople do vacation to CERN,\u201d Lydia informs him.\nStiles wrinkles his nose. \u201cBoring people.\u201d\nLydia sniffs. \u201cDo you even know what they\u2019re accomplishing over there?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Dark matter, quarks, string theory\u2014\u201d Stiles flaps a hand. \u201c\u2014Star Trek stuff.\u201d\nLydia sighs exasperatedly, and Stiles smiles.\nShe presses him for a few more details. Stiles gives her the unimportant ones\u2014what they ate for dinner, the funny names of towns they had passed through, the creepy gas station bathroom with dozens of dead butterflies in shadowboxes, each neatly pinned and labeled. He works toward whatever arbitrary quota Lydia has set for this phone call, wanting to get this over and done with before he gives in to the growing, sickening urge to ask about his father.\n\u201cAaannd\u2026 I got to level five on my racing game,\u201d Stiles says, desperately casting around for something else to say. He hasn\u2019t told her about the sleeping situation, or his newfound libido, or the fact that Cora is werewolf Snow White. \u201cUh. The vending machine here has Combos?\u201d\n\u201cMm-hm,\u201d Lydia says disinterestedly.\nStiles thinks harder. \u201cI\u2014\u201d\n\u201cStiles,\u201d Lydia interrupts. \u201cThis is riveting. Really. However, we have something to discuss. You\u2019re not going to like it, but I think it\u2019s time.\u201d\nStiles\u2019 mouth goes dry.\nLydia pauses. \u201cStiles. You need to know\u2014and I think you already do\u2014that you didn\u2019t leave Beacon Hills because your father was going to send you away.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Stiles all but croaks. \u201cYes, I did. I\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t play stupid.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not playing stupid.\u201d\nLydia sighs, but carries on with an obvious forced patience. \u201cStiles, if you really thought that your father was through with you, why did you take so many measures against being found? The cell phone, the cash, the computer\u2014\u201d\nStiles inhales, exhales. \u201cDanny\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d says Lydia flatly.\n\u201cHe was,\u201d Stiles insists. \u201cHe was going to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cStiles, you left Beacon Hills because you wanted to,\u201d Lydia says, steamrolling over him as she clearly abandons any pretense of patience, \u201cand that\u2019s okay. You weren\u2019t wrong. You should have left. You needed to leave.\u201d\nStiles glances at the door to their motel room. At the parking lot. Anywhere.\n\u201cYou did. I know this isn\u2019t easy,\u201d Lydia tells him, with all the sympathy of a hunk of steel. \u201cBut you need to accept that, because it means that when\u2014if you come back, it can be different. It\u2019s going to be different.\u201d\n\u201cDifferent how?\u201d Stiles asks faintly.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be better, for you. The Nemeton clearly has some hold over you that it doesn\u2019t have over Scott and Allison, and we\u2019re going to put a stop to it\u2014Deaton agrees with me, and he\u2019s concerned for what it could mean. We\u2019re working on it together.\u201d\nGod, of course they are.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not\u2014it\u2019s not the Nemeton, Lydia,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cYou can\u2019t fix this.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d Lydia says dismissively. \u201cYou\u2019re better than that moronic, self-deprecating teenager shit. I know you are. Deaton and I have a very good theory in the works right now ab\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOh my God, Stiles, this isn\u2019t that difficult!\u201d she huffs. \u201cDo you trust me?\u201d\n\u201cOf course I do,\u201d Stiles says instantly. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThen trust me when I say that it will be better here, when you come back,\u201d Lydia say sternly, so sternly that it\u2019s like she thinks she can will it to be so with her words alone.\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d Stiles sighs. \u201cYes. I believe you.\u201d\n\u201cNo, not whatever,\u201d Lydia says. \u201cDon\u2019t patronize me, Stiles. I know it was terrible for you here, and you had every right to leave, and you have every right to not come back, but if\u2014if you\u2019re going to leave your family and your friends behind, then it will not be because you\u2019re too cowardly to admit that coming back is an option.\u201d\nStiles gapes. It\u2019s a few seconds before he manages to form words. \u201cF-fuck you. Fuck you, you have no idea, you\u2014you sat on your ass for two months and watched me, apparently knew all along what I was going through, and now you\u2019re going to call me a coward?\u201d\n\u201cYou could have asked for help,\u201d Lydia says frostily.\n\u201cYeah, with all that time we spent together\u2014oh, wait. No. You were too busy fucking Aiden. And even if you hadn\u2019t been, it wouldn\u2019t have mattered, because you can\u2019t fix this. You can\u2019t fix me. It wasn\u2019t the Nemeton, it was me, it was just me. So leave it alone. All right?\u201d\nThere is a long pause, and then Lydia sighs like Stiles is inconveniencing her. \u201cFine. Be that way. Go sleep on it and we\u2019ll talk more about this later.\u201d\n\u201cNo, we won\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cYes, we will. You\u2019re braver than that, Stiles. I know you\u2014\u201d\nStiles hangs up, jabbing his thumb onto the END CALL button and then stops, standing there, clutching the phone in front of him and trembling. He\u2019s close to hyperventilating right now. He has to calm down.\nHe can\u2019t think about this right now.\n\u00a0\nStiles comes back into the motel room pale and shaking, taking care of any lingering doubts that Derek had about getting another room with one king bed instead of two queens. And he isn\u2019t surprised at all when Stiles wakes both him and Cora up in the middle of the night, jerking and muttering and inconsolable until they manage to wake him up.\n\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d Derek says, guiding a wide-eyed Stiles out of bed. \u201cC\u2019mon, let\u2019s walk. Get out of here.\u201d\nStiles looks back at Cora.\n\u201cGo,\u201d she says dismissively, waving a hand at them and already laying her head back down. \u201cI\u2019ll keep the bed warm.\u201d\nThey bundle up and head outside, where it\u2019s begun to snow. Stiles sticks close.\n\u201cFuck,\u201d he breathes, ducking his head against the wind. \u201cIt\u2019s fucking freezing, I was not built for this.\u201d\n\u201cAren\u2019t you Polish?\u201d Derek asks.\n\u201cYou\u2019re Welsh,\u201d Stiles retorts. \u201cBut do you see me making sheep jokes?\u201d\nDerek has no idea what being Welsh has to do with sheep, but he doesn\u2019t want to ask.\n\u201cHow are you not cold right now?\u201d Stiles demands, glaring.\n\u201cWerewolf,\u201d Derek reminds him.\nStiles huffs. \u201cYeah, okay, but you guys don\u2019t run that much hotter than humans. Plus, if you think about it, you should be more susceptible to cold. See, because cold is just the magnitude of the difference between your body temperature and the environmental temperature, so it makes sense that you guys aren\u2019t bothering by heat because it\u2019s just closer to your internal temperature, but cold\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWerewolf, Stiles.\u201d\n\u201cScience,\u201d Stiles retorts.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get you a hat and a scarf, tomorrow,\u201d Derek promises.\n\"Does that mean we\u2019re staying in the north? Because I vote we move south. This is nuts. I thought wasn\u2019t supposed to snow until Christmas,\u201d Stiles grouses.\n\u201cWherever you guys want,\u201d Derek says, shrugging.\nStiles stops walking, and turns to stare at Derek disbelievingly. \u201cYou don\u2019t have any opinion on the subject? None at all?\u201d\n\u201cNot really,\u201d Derek says, honestly.\n\u201cOh, come on,\u201d Stiles urges. \u201cWe talked about this, dude. You can have opinions on things without killing people.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m aware,\u201d Derek says, gritting his teeth.\n\u201cSo, tell me where you want to go. Or where you don\u2019t want to go. It\u2019s just like the pizza thing, I promise, you\u2019re not going to acci\u2014\u201d\n\u201cStiles, I don\u2019t care,\u201d Derek grits out, hands balling into fists. \u201cI don\u2019t give two shits about where we go next. That\u2019s all there is to it.\u201d\n\"What do you care about, then?\u201d Stiles demands, his own hands flying up in irritation. \u201cHuh? You don\u2019t care if we go north or south, if we go hiking or driving, if we get steamed or fried rice, if I sleep on the floor or between you and Co\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou,\u201d Derek interrupts forcefully, grabbing Stiles\u2019 hands and pulling them down, covering them with his own palms.\nStiles stares, mouth hanging open.\n\u201cI care about you,\u201d Derek says, calmer. \u201cAnd Cora. I want you two to be happy. That\u2019s all. Okay?\u201d\nStiles blinks. His mouth is open in a perfect O, his cheeks and ears rosy with cold, and there are melted snowflakes glittering in his hair. He\u2019s beautiful.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Derek says, releasing one of Stiles\u2019 hands but keeping the other, gripping it tightly against the cold. \u201cIf you stand still too long, you\u2019ll turn into a snowman.\u201d\nStiles stumbles after him, and doesn\u2019t say anything for the rest of their walk, not even when Derek slips their joined hands into Stiles\u2019 coat pocket.\n\u00a0\nStiles is being weird, today. And by weird, Cora means annoying as shit. He basically hasn\u2019t stopped talking since he woke up, has the attention span of a goldfish, and twitchy to the point of almost being a danger to himself. If she hadn\u2019t heard the rattle of the pill bottle this morning, she\u2019d think that Stiles had just decided to go without Adderall today.\nHe has also, seemingly out of nowhere, picked up an encyclopedic knowledge of the history of The Badlands, and has been spewing it at Derek and Cora whenever there\u2019s a half-second of silence. Which, because it\u2019s Derek and Cora\u2026 There are a lot of those.\nShe tries to tune him out, which isn\u2019t too hard because she really likes The Badlands. They look like a literal wasteland\u2014dead, jagged, and silent save for the winds that whip across them. It\u2019s so different from home. In a weird way, it makes her ache to go back. But before she can delve too deeply into that ache, Stiles\u2019 jabbering keeps pulling her out of her thoughts.\nBy mid-afternoon, she can\u2019t take it any longer.\n\u201c\u2014no one really bothered to figure out exactly where the boundaries were, so when the US military started firing off\u2014\u201d\n\u201cStiles,\u201d she interrupts.\nDerek looks over at her sharply from the driver\u2019s seat.\u00a0\nCora raises her eyebrows at him.\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Stiles asks, worrying at the fur of the idiotic wolf hat he\u2019d bought at the park\u2019s gift shop this morning. \u201cShit. Sorry. I\u2019m talking too much, aren\u2019t I?\u201d\nDerek shakes his head minutely.\nHe\u2019s been oddly indulgent of Stiles, today. That\u2019s been pissing her off, too.\n\u201cJust a little,\u201d Cora says eventually, through gritted teeth.\n\u201cOh,\u201d says Stiles. \u201cSorry. I\u2019ll.\u201d\nShe can hear him worrying the fur, still.\nIt\u2019s quiet for almost ten minutes before Stiles starts up again.\n\u00a0\n\n(Soft, warm hands wake him. Stiles thinks it\u2019s Mom, until he sees Tara\u2019s face staring down at him in the soft light of his room, and the wave of disappointment is so fierce he almost starts to cry right then and there. Mom\u2019s dead. She\u2019s been dead for weeks. He should know better now.\n\n\n\u201cHi, sweetheart,\u201d Tara whispers. \u201cSorry to wake you up.\u201d\n\n\nStiles is confused. His nightlight is on and it\u2019s still dark, so it can\u2019t be time for school. Why is Tara here? Where\u2019s Dad?\n\n\nThen he notices Sheriff Briggs standing in the doorway of his bedroom, which is even more confusing. Sheriff Briggs is really tall and really thick, and Dad always says he\u2019s a \u2018good man\u2019. But why he is here, in Stiles\u2019 bedroom?\n\n\n\u201cYou need to get up, Stiles,\u201d Tara says, pulling him out of bed.\n\n\nStiles sleepily complies, shivering in the night air. Tara pulls a soft hoodie over his head, the one with dragon spikes on the hood, and helps Stiles push his arms through the sleeves. Sheriff Briggs is holding his Scooby Doo suitcase, the one Bubbe had gotten him for Hanukkah for when he came to visit. Is he going to see Bubbe?\n\n\nSheriff Briggs hands the suitcase to Tara and picks Stiles up, settling him easily on his hip.\n\n\nDad can\u2019t pick Stiles up anymore. Stiles is too big. It feels nice. Sheriff Briggs is all warm and solid.\n\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Dad?\u201d Stiles mumbles against Sheriff Briggs\u2019 collar.\n\n\n\u201cYour dad\u2026 He isn\u2019t in a good place right now, sonny boy,\u201d Sheriff Briggs tells him.\n\n\nStiles yawns. \u201cWhere? Are we gonna get him? Wha\u2019bout Bubbe?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, he means\u2014your dad\u2019s been really sad about your mom, sweetie, so he talked to us, and we all agreed to get him some help, and while you dad\u2019s getting better, he thought you\u2019d be happier somewhere else,\u201d Tara explains gently, as she follows them down the stairs. \u201cIt\u2019s only for a little while. Do you remember your aunt Rose? She\u2019s coming to pick you up. It\u2019s like an adventure. Like Sam Gribley.\u201d\n\n\nSam Gribley is Stiles\u2019 favorite.\n\n\nBut\u2014\n\n\n\u201cYou gotta sign my slip,\u201d Stiles slurs, trying to lift his head. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018nother detention one. Miss Marquez says if I don\u2019t get it signed, I\u2019ll get \u2018nother s\u2019pension.\u201d\n\n\nStiles has had a lot of detentions and suspensions, lately. He doesn\u2019t mean to get them. They\u2019re boring, and Dad always looks so tired when Stiles hands him the pink slips of paper to sign. He can\u2019t get another suspension.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll talk to Miss Marquez,\u201d Tara promises.\n\n\n\u201cWhat \u2018bout Scott \u2018n\u2019 Heath\u2019r?\u201d Stiles asks.\n\n\n\u201cMaybe they can come visit,\u201d Tara says. \u201cI don\u2019t know. We can ask Aunt Rose.\u201d\n\n\nAunt Rose. Stiles is going to live with Aunt Rose.\n\n\n\u201cWhat about my dad?\u201d Stiles asks, because if he lives with Aunt Rose how will he live with Dad?\n\n\n\u201cYour dad\u2019s gonna get better while you\u2019re gone,\u201d Tara says.\n\n\nStiles frowns, not like that answer at all. \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave. I want my dad.\u201d\n\n\nThey stop at the bottom of the stairs, and Tara runs a hand over his hair. \u201cI know, sweetheart. But it\u2019s only for a little while. You have to be brave for your dad.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s crying, now. \u201cI want my dad. He wants me, too. He loves me, even when I\u2019m bad.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe loves you very much, but he\u2019s going through a hard time and he can\u2019t take care of you right now,\u201d Tara says soothingly. \u201cCan you be brave for him, Stiles?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo. No, I want my dad, where\u2019s my dad?\u201d He\u2019s really sobbing, now, squirming against Sheriff Briggs\u2019 arms. He looks frantically around the living room for his dad through tears, but his dad isn\u2019t on the couch like he usually is. There\u2019s just empty bottles. \u201cDad? Dad! Where\u2019s Dad?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s at the station,\u201d Sheriff Briggs says firmly. \u201cHe\u2019s not in good shape, Stiles. He\u2019s a little drunk right now.\u201d\n\n\n\"No,\u201d Stiles hiccups, twisting, kicking, hysterically trying to get away. \u201cNo, no, no, no, I want my dad, I want Dad, I want\u2014I want Dad\u2014Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad\u2014\u201d\n\n\nHe can\u2019t breathe.\n\n\n\u201c\u2014Daddy\u2014\u201d\n\nHe can\u2019t breathe.\n\n\u201c\u2014Dad\u2014\u201d)\n\nHe can\u2019t breathe.\n\u00a0\n\u201cStiles,\u201d Derek says urgently, but it\u2019s no good because Stiles is curled away from him. \u201cCora, tell him to breathe. Make eye contact, make him\u2014count.\u201d\n\u201cDad,\u201d Stiles manages. \u201cDad, call\u2014call Dad.\u201d\nCora forcibly rolls Stiles over so that he\u2019s facing Derek. \u201cI\u2019ll call his dad. You deal with the breathing\u2026 thing.\u201d\nDerek passes her his cell phone and pushes down the bed covers, resisting the urge to grab Stiles by the shoulders. \u201cStiles. What\u2019s your dad\u2019s number?\u201d\nStiles shakes his head.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know it?\u201d\nHe keeps shaking his head, staring up at Derek helplessly.\n\u201cI\u2019ll call Lydia\u2014she\u2019ll have it,\u201d Cora says.\nDerek turns his gaze back to Stiles, locking eyes. \u201cYou need to breathe, Stiles. Breathe. Deep breaths, come on.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014am,\u201d Stiles pants, through rapid-fire breaths. \u201cI am\u2014I can\u2014breathe\u2014shit.\u201d\nDerek snorts, suppressed panic leaking through in spurts of giddiness. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the time to be contrary, Stiles.\u201d\nStiles chokes for a second, lets out a sort of giggle-snerk that ends in him taking harsh, lung-filling breaths of air. They sound stressed, wheezed, but at least he\u2019s breathing deeper.\n\u201cStiles, Stiles, quite contrary, how does your garden grow?\u201d Stiles breathes, all in a high rush, giggling manically between gasps of air.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cLydia, it\u2019s Cora. No, don\u2019t hang up, it\u2019s an emergency. I need Stiles\u2019 dad\u2019s number, right now.\u201d\nStiles closes his eyes, his breathing picking up again.\n\u201cStiles, look at me,\u201d Derek orders. \u201cOpen your eyes and look at me. It will help. I promise.\u201d\nStiles shakes his head.\n\u201cStiles.\u201d\n\u201cGot it, I\u2019ve got it,\u201d Cora says, shoving the phone at Stiles, which isn\u2019t helpful because Stiles isn\u2019t looking. Derek takes the phone from her, cautiously takes Stiles\u2019 hand, and when he doesn\u2019t flinch away, he places the phone in it and brings it up to Stiles\u2019 ear.\nHe glances up a Cora, who stares back at him.\n\u201cHello?\u201d Derek hears the Sheriff say, from the other end of the line.\n\u201cDad,\u201d Stiles chokes out, and bursts into tears.\n\u201cStiles? What\u2019s wrong? Are you hurt? Where are you?\u201d the Sheriff demands. \u201cStiles!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Stiles sobs. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I left, it wasn\u2019t your fault, I tried, I-I\u2019m a bad person and a bad son and\u2014\u201d\nDerek definitely feels like he should no longer be within hearing range of his conversation. Judging by the look on Cora\u2019s face, she\u2019s feeling the same way.\n\u201cBreathe, Stiles,\u201d the Sheriff orders, suddenly calm. \u201cLet me hear you breathe. One breath. In.\u201d\nStiles breathes in, deep, until he chokes on another sob.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Stiles. Give me another one.\u201d\nStiles breathes in again, this one better.\n\u201cGood. That\u2019s two. Again, now.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d Stiles insists, sucking in a huge lungful of air. \u201cI\u2019m okay now, I\u2019m okay, I\u2019m okay\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBreathe, idiot,\u201d Derek and the Sheriff stay in unison\u2014though it\u2019s just Derek who tacks on the insult.\nStiles inhales again, and then again unprompted. He does sound better. Derek\u2019s pretty sure the hyperventilation stopped the moment Stiles heard his dad\u2019s voice, but the subsequent sobbing definitely hadn\u2019t been good, either. He wonders what would have happened if they hadn\u2019t been able to reach Stiles\u2019 father.\nDerek and Cora get up to leave, but Stiles snakes a hand out, grabbing Derek as his eyes shoot to Cora.\n\u201cW-where are you going?\u201d\n\u201cStiles?\u201d the Sheriff asks, sounding confused.\n\u201cTo give you privacy, dumbass,\u201d Cora says.\nStiles\u2019 heart trips a little at that. \u201cLike\u2014like out of the room?\u201d\nDerek looks around. There isn\u2019t really anywhere else to go. Except\u2026\n\u00a0\n\u201cReally, Derek? Really?\u201d Cora asks, as they sit on the floor of the bathroom, backs against the wall.\nDerek shrugs, not meeting her gaze.\nShe rolls her eyes and sighs, but lays her head on his shoulder, closing her eyes to go back to sleep.\n\u00a0\nWith the calmness that came from finally talking to his father, comes the crushing realization that Stiles has, in fact, called his father.\n\u201cStiles?\u201d his father asks tentatively, after Stiles has been quiet for too long. \u201cAre you okay? You\u2019re not hurt, are you?\u201d\n\"No,\u201d Stiles says, after a pause.\n\u201cOkay. Are you in a safe place?\u201d his father asks slowly.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cIs someone there with you? Someone you trust?\u201d\nStiles\u2019 eyes flick to the closed bathroom door. \u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cDo you want to get something to drink?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2014\u201d Stiles swallows, and asks in a small voice, \u201cDad, on\u2014on a scale from one to ten, how disowned am I?\u201d\n\u201cWith\u2026 ten being the most disowned?\u201d Dad asks.\n\u201cUh-huh.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Dad says thoughtfully, \u201cconsidering that, I guess I\u2019d have to say about a negative three. Or a negative four.\u201d\nStiles blows out a breath.\n\u201cChrist, Stiles. What did I do wrong that you think I\u2019d disown you?\u201d\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Stiles says miserably. \u201cIt\u2019s just me and my stupid brain.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with your brain, Stiles,\u201d Dad says, like always.\n\u201cDad,\u201d Stiles says quietly. \u201cDad, I\u2014you remember the magic tree that the Darach held you guys hostage under?\u201d\n\u201cThe\u2026 nematode? What does that have to do with your brain?\u201d\n\u201cNematon, yeah. Well. To find you guys, Scott, Allison and I sort of had to\u2026 bind ourselves to it, a little bit. So now we all sort of have this, uh, darkness. Around our hearts. It\u2019s sort of like the Horcrux locket from Harry Potter? The one in the seventh book?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026evil?\u201d Dad tries.\nA horrible, cold abyss right in the center of your chest, creeping around your heart and ensnaring your lungs until both are frozen and you\u2019re sure you\u2019re dead.\n\u201cKind of,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2014bad. Like this awful thing in your chest, all the time. And, anyway, the only way to deal with it is to ignore it. Focus on other things, you know? But. But I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t filter out distractions,\u201d Dad fills in heavily, when Stiles can\u2019t finish the sentence.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d \u00a0\nDad sighs. \u201cDammit, Stiles. Why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d\nStiles swallows hard, feeling his throat tighten. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a long, long silence.\n\u201cDad?\u201d Stiles asks, and there\u2019s no helping the quaver in his voice.\n\u201cYou know when I\u2014after your mother died, when you went to live with Aunt Rose while I\u2014got better,\u201d Dad says slowly, and Stiles basically stops breathing because this is like numeros uno, dos, and tres on the Stilinski List of Things We Don\u2019t Talk About. \u201cAfter that first week, when I came to visit you for the first time. It was. Stiles, the moment I saw you again, that was\u2014it was the happiest I\u2019d felt in months.\u201d\nStiles remembers the hug his father had given him after that week apart, huge and sweeping and bone-crushing, like you see in movies. He remembers his shirt collar coming away wet, and his father smiling even though there were tear running down his face.\n\u201cYou being away,\u201d Dad goes on quietly, \u201cit made me realize how much I couldn\u2019t ever lose you. And every visit after that, before I brought you back home\u2014they were the brightest parts of my days. Seeing you is always the brightest part of my day, Stiles. Even when we\u2019re fighting, or you\u2019re bouncing off the walls, or you\u2019re lying to me about werewolves, of all things. And I will always want you around.\u201d\nStiles is crying again. \u201cDad\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIn that video you left me, you mentioned Aunt Rose,\u201d Dad says, sounding old and tired. \u201cYou thought I was going to send you away again.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles says through tears. \u201cI mean, no. It was the Nemeton, it got in my head. I had nightmares, and hallucinations, and\u2014shit, I owe Lydia an apology\u2014but I didn\u2019t really think that\u2026 You. You wouldn\u2019t. I know you wouldn\u2019t, Dad.\u201d\n\u201cStiles, I swear to you, there is nothing on this earth that would make me send you away again,\u201d Dad says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t in my right mind, back then. Losing your mother was the worst thing that has ever happened to me, and I\u2014I screwed up, kid. I screwed up bad.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Stiles says thickly.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Dad replies.\nStiles sniffles. \u201c\u2026so I can come home?\u201d\n\u201cYou can always come home, Stiles.\u201d\nStiles chokes on a sob and nods. \u201cOkay. Okay, I\u2019ll come home. I love you.\u201d\n\u201cI love you too, kid. You gonna be okay? You need me to come get you?\u201d\n\u201cNo. No, I\u2019ll be okay. They\u2019ll drive me home. Can I call you in the morning, though?\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\nStiles sniffles again. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Dad says.\n\u00a0\nEventually, there\u2019s a tentative knock on the bathroom door, and then it opens to reveal Stiles. His eyes are puffy, face tear-stained, and his expression is exhausted. He takes in the sight of Derek and Cora sitting on the floor of the bathroom, though, and a small smile tugs at the corners of his lips.\nCora lifts her head, yawning. Derek wonders if he should move the arm he has around her, but she doesn\u2019t seem to mind, so he keeps it there.\n\u201cWere you listening?\u201d Stiles asks quietly.\nDerek shakes his head.\nStiles looks down. \u201cI\u2014I talked to my dad. Would it be all right if you guys drove me back home, tomorrow?\u201d\n\u201cIs he forcing you to go home?\u201d Derek asks, eyes narrowing.\n\u201cNo!\u201d Stiles says, head jerking up. \u201cNo, no, oh my God, no. I want to go home. Not that you guys haven\u2019t been awesome. These two weeks were\u2014you guys helped me so much. And we had fun. I got to touch an elk! I am so, so grateful\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe get it,\u201d Derek interrupts.\n\u201cAnd it was a moose,\u201d Cora puts in helpfully.\n\u201cElk,\u201d Stiles and Derek reply in unison.\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d Cora says through another yawn. \u201cWe\u2019re taking you home tomorrow. Awesome. Can we go to sleep?\u201d\nDerek looks to Stiles, who nods, before he starts to get up. Cora\u2019s already standing and leading the way back to the bed, but she waits for Stiles to get in first before laying down next to him. Derek crawls in last, on Stiles\u2019 other side, and flicks off the lamp. The pillows smell like the three of them, the scents of others before them completely obliterated, and he can hear both Stiles\u2019 and Cora\u2019s hearts beating. He can hear them breathing.\nHe doesn\u2019t need to have Alpha-level senses for this. Now, here, when they\u2019re snuggled in close, being a Beta is just fine.\n\u00a0\nThey sleep late in the morning, but luckily wake up before check-out time. Stiles packs his stuff, zips up his coat, pulls his wolf hat snugly over his head, and goes outside to call his father. Cora\u2019s tempted to listen in, but when she makes a move toward the door, Derek gives her an exasperated look and she glares, but goes back to packing.\nThey hit the road by eleven.\nIt\u2019s good that Stiles is going home, she guesses. He should go home. And despite everything, she does recognize that without Stiles she and Derek would probably still be miserably congealing in that motel in the desert. She\u2019s glad that he came. She might even go so far as to say that she\u2019ll miss him when he\u2019s gone. Without Stiles to act as a buffer, it\u2019ll too be weird to only get one-bed rooms any longer.\nCora had sort of been looking forward to Chicago, but she\u2019s not crushed to be missing it. And more importantly, she thinks she has a good idea of where she wants to go after they drop Stiles off.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d is the first thing Stiles says.\n\u201cObviously,\u201d Lydia replies archly.\nStiles sighs, and doesn\u2019t know why he was expecting anything more. \u201cI\u2019m coming home. I should be there late tomorrow night.\u201d\n\u201cMm-hmm,\u201d Lydia says, sounding utterly unsurprised.\n\u201cWhatever you and Deaton are working on,\u201d Stiles goes on, hesitantly now. \u201cI\u2019ll\u2014well, I\u2019ll try it, but I\u2019m not expecting it to work. I still don\u2019t think it has anything to do with the Nemeton taking a special interest in me, or whatever.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d Lydia says. \u201cIt will work.\u201d\nStiles rolls his eyes. \u201cUh-huh.\u201d\n\u201cIt will. We have an amulet almost ready to go that should definitely help. Also, in case you\u2019d forgotten, we have finals in three weeks. I need someone halfway intelligent to study with, so you\u2019d better be caught up with your work by then.\u201d\n\u201cUgh,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI was planning on failing and going to summer school.\u201d\n\u201cUnacceptable,\u201d Lydia declares.\n\"We can negotiate when I get home,\u201d Stiles says, though he already knows that he\u2019ll lose. The word \u2018negotiate\u2019 does not exist in Lydia\u2019s vocabulary.\n\u201cOf course we can,\u201d Lydia says smugly, because she knows she\u2019s already won as well.\n\u201cLet me keep my illusions of dignity. Good bye, Lydia.\u201d\n\u201cGood bye, Stiles,\u201d she says, and then adds, in a tone of voice that is finally soft, \u201cand\u2026 I\u2019m glad you\u2019re coming back.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWhen Stiles gets back in the car, he\u2019s smiling. Derek can\u2019t help but let Stiles\u2019 happiness catch on, despite the impending separation hanging heavily over their heads. He\u2019s glad, at least, that Lydia\u2019s going to be helping Stiles out this time. It\u2019ll make it easier to say goodbye.\nThey wait for Cora to finish using the bathroom in silence, until Stiles breaks it.\n\u201cSo, uh,\u201d says Stiles. \u201cThanks for trying to talk me through that panic attack last night, instead of\u2014kissing me. Or something.\u201d\n\u201cKissing you?\u201d Derek repeats, going for amused even as he feels a flash of worry that he\u2019s been reading this whole thing between them wrong.\nStiles nods. \u201cYeah. Uh. Historically, that is a method that people have used to try to stop my panic attacks.\u201d\n\u201cDoes it work?\u201d Derek asks, frowning.\n\u201cActually, it does. Really well. But\u2014\u201d Stiles stops, and Derek has to stop himself from demanding Stiles finish that sentence.\nBut what?\nStiles looks up from his lap, meeting Derek\u2019s eyes in the rearview mirror, then looks back down. \u201cBut if you were\u2026 gonna kiss me. For whatever reason. That\u2019s kind of a crappy one.\u201d\nDerek smiles at that, ducking his head to the side so Stiles won\u2019t see it in the mirror. When Cora gets back and they set out on the road again, he pushes play on Stiles\u2019 stupid mix CD, and lets him listen to it the whole way through. Just once.\n(They listen to it more than once.)\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s their last night together. \u00a0They find a motel in the middle of Nevada, and they get a king bed for the night. None of them speak as they stumble into the bed, Derek wrapping himself around Stiles, who grabs at the starfished Cora to pull her closer. It\u2019s the last night they\u2019ll do this.\nSomehow, all three of them fall asleep within ten minutes anyway.\n\u00a0\nStiles can feel the Nemeton, as they get closer. It feels like his chest is being slowly compressed by a block of ice, the pressure getting worse and worse as they approach, but it doesn\u2019t seem as soul-crushing as it had when he left. He concentrates on Derek, and Cora, and the newest sheet of Mad Libs, and sings along at the top of his lung to the fantastic notes of Lawrence of My Labia, and it seems almost bearable.\n\u00a0\nThey pull into Beacon Hills in the late afternoon. Stiles asks Derek to drop him off at the end of the block he lives on, if only to spare him and Cora an awkward interrogation. After Derek parks, it takes Stiles almost ten minutes to finish rooting out the last of his miscellaneous candy wrappers and soda bottles, and then a few more to stuff the winter jacket and the ridiculous wolf hat into his lacrosse bag. He leaves the fishing and the racing game in the car.\n\u201cIn case you guys get bored,\u201d Stiles says, looking from Derek to Cora significantly. \u201cAnd I left the binder of mix CD\u2019s, if you get tired of the radio. And the Mad Libs! Though I don\u2019t know how much fun it\u2019ll be with just two people. Oh, and there\u2019s extra batteries for the games, in the pouchy thing behind Derek\u2019s seat. Are you guys sure you don\u2019t want the rest of my Sour Patch Kids?\u201d\n\u201cEw.\u201d\n\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d\n\u201cAll right, all right,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cFine. No stale Sour Patch Kids for you.\u201d\nStiles plays with the strap of his lacrosse bag, which is sitting at his feet. Derek and Cora are awkwardly assembled before him, and Cora can see that Derek is going to make no move to break the awkward, so she takes it upon herself.\n\u201cWell,\u201d she says. \u201cCatch you later.\u201d\n\u201cBet you\u2019re happy to finally get rid of me, huh?\u201d Stiles asks.\nCora scowls. \u201cDon\u2019t be an idiot, Stilinski.\u201d\nStiles brightens at that. \u201cOh! Hey! Dad said he kept my phone. Gimmie yours, I\u2019ll program my number in.\u201d\nCora sighs, but hands her phone over. When she gets it back moments later, the new contact is not saved under \u2018Stiles\u2019 or \u2018Stilinski\u2019.\n\u201cMel-whatsit-what?\u201d she says, staring at the name on the display.\nDerek peers at it curiously. His eyebrows shoot up.\n\u201cTold you,\u201d Stiles says smugly.\n\u201cWhat the hell language even is that even from?\u201d Cora demands.\nStiles grins. \u201cHebrew.\u201d\n\u201cHuh,\u201d Cora says, staring at the name again, because that doesn\u2019t help at all in figuring out how to pronounce it. She looks up when she realizes that they\u2019ve descended into awkward silence again, and rolls her eyes before shoving her brother forward.\nBoys. Honestly.\n\u201cYou, uh,\u201d Derek mumbles. \u201cYou okay to carry that to the house?\u201d\nStiles rolls his eyes. \u201cDude. I carried it from the bus stop to your motel when it was like a thousand degrees out. I think I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\u201cI was just asking,\u201d Derek says defensively.\nStiles deflates at that, stares at Derek for a moment, then comes forward and wraps his arms around Derek in a hug.\nDerek stiffens, relaxes, then gradually reciprocates. That\u2019s something Cora\u2019s definitely going to have to fix in the upcoming weeks. They\u2019ve been using Stiles as their affection buffer for long enough, now.\nThen, somehow, the hug transforms into Derek kissing Stiles.\nCora watches with raised eyebrows as this time Stiles is the one to stiffen, relax, then gradually reciprocate. It\u2019s a careful kiss, modest\u2014there are definitely no tongues involved\u2014and less than a minute passes before Derek breaks away but keeps Stiles steadily in his arms.\nStiles is grinning dopily.\n\u201cAm I your pepperoni?\u201d he asks nonsensically, when he catches his breath.\nDerek grins, small and private. \u201cI guess so.\u201d\nUgh. Romance. Give her horses, any day.\nCora sends a text message to Stiles\u2019 phone\u2014a generic it\u2019s Cora so he\u2019ll have her number\u2014as Stiles and Derek grin at each other like loons for a few moments. She supposes they\u2019ve earned that. Eventually, they both remember that the rest of the world exists and turn to look at her with weirdly guilty expressions.\n\u201cWhat, do you want my blessing?\u201d she asks.\nDerek\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cUh\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMove over,\u201d Cora orders, walking over to the pair of them and elbowing Derek out of the way. He goes easily enough, allowing Cora to take Stiles\u2019 face in her hands and plant the biggest, wettest kiss she can right on his lips.\nStiles stares at her, wide-eyed, when she pulls back. His eyes go to Derek, and then back to Cora. \u201cUh.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d kiss you, too,\u201d Cora tells Derek, \u201cbut eugh. No.\u201d\n\u201cSo. You\u2019re okay with\u2026?\u201d Derek asks tentatively.\n\u201cYes,\u201d says Cora, exasperated. \u201cNow c\u2019mon. You\u2019re just going to stand here staring into Stiles\u2019 eyes and we\u2019ve got ground to cover before the sun sets. Bye, Stiles! Thanks for traveling!\u201d\nDerek huffs, but he\u2019s smiling as he does.\n\u201cWhere are you guys going next?\u201d Stiles asks, tentatively shouldering his lacrosse bag.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d Derek tells him easily, and then he swoops in for a last, quick kiss, before heading around to the driver\u2019s side. \u201cSee you later, Stiles.\u201d\n\u201cWait,\u201d Stiles says suddenly, frowning. \u201cWait a minute, am I dating both of you right now? Is that what\u2019s going on?\u201d\nDerek doesn\u2019t answer, and Cora just smirks at Stiles through the passenger window. Stiles flips her off. She waves cheerily.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s weird, to have Stiles gone. Quiet. Derek wouldn\u2019t say that he\u2019s tempted, necessarily, to open the binder of mix CD\u2019s. But he could perhaps see a time in the distant future when he might unzip it and pop one of the CD\u2019s into the player. Perhaps.\nThey stop for gas just outside of Beacon Hills, at the same place where Chris Argent broke the window of the Camaro, almost a year ago.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Derek says, as the gas pumps. Cora\u2019s finished pushing the layer of dead bugs off the windshield with the squeegee, and is watching the numbers on the terminal go up alongside him. \u201cYou said, a while ago, that\u2014that this trip wasn\u2019t about us.\u201d\nCora looks at him, and then looks back at the meter. \u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Derek continues carefully, \u201cthen I want to know. If it\u2019s not about us, then what is it about?\u201d\nThe gas pump clicks as the tank reaches capacity. Derek doesn\u2019t move to pull it out.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t about us,\u201d Cora sighs, not looking at him. \u201cI didn\u2019t want it to be. But\u2014now it is.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s\u2026 okay?\u201d Derek asks.\nCora turns to look at him. \u201cYou wanna see my home?\u201d\n\u201cYour\u2014\u201d Then Derek gets it, and he stares at her.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a drive,\u201d Cora admits.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Derek says immediately. \u201cYes, I want to see.\u201d\nCora grins.\n\u00a0\n You:   About to cross the Mexican border. If you don\u2019t have international texting, get it.\n Melchizedek:   I have it.\nMelchizedek:   Wait, do you guys have passports? How are you getting across?\n You:   Werewolves.\n Melchizedek:   OMG your answer to every plot hole cannot just be WEREWOLVES\n You:   Derek says to remind you that we don\u2019t actually live in a movie.\n Melchizedek:   Do not even, we could make a freaking epic out of our lives. Star Wars has nothing on us.\u00a0"
