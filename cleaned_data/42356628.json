However, if you feel the need for more details about how Harry and Draco will affect the past, you\u2019re in luck because I have something resembling a sequel already half-written. Subscribe to the series for part 2, which will feature a much higher ratio of feels to humor, a depressed Harry adjusting to life without Ron and Hermione, a Regulus/Draco bromance, a marauder-worthy master of death, a jealous Remus, a very barebones description of the horcrux hunt because it\u2019s been done before by others with more enthusiasm than I can bother to muster, a semi-redemption for Peter and a purely-hypothetical redemption for Snape, and some hopefully humorous Harry-shenanigans-centric drinking games.</p>",
    "text": "James and Sirius are already together when they get the summons from Dumbledore. It\u2019s strange because they\u2019re not scheduled for back-up duty tonight, nor are they important enough to the Order to be roped into specialized projects.\nWell, until now. Maybe this is their big break. A chance to prove themselves.\nThey bow out of Pub Night, bidding giddily nervous goodbyes to Lily, Moony, and Wormy, and apparate to the designated safehouse. Dumbledore is already there, along with Moody (James still can\u2019t bring himself to think of the man as Alastor) and McGonagall (ditto about Minerva), which is the second strange thing about tonight because McGonagall is very rarely involved in Order affairs while Hogwarts is in session. James blinks at her, mentally confirms that it\u2019s barely May, and, yes, May is during the school year, and greets her with a puzzled smile.\n\u201cThank you for coming on such short notice,\u201d Dumbledore says, ushering them inside. They\u2019re at the Devon safehouse, a plain two-storey home mostly filled with bedrooms, medical supplies, and a potions lab. Oh, and its secret dungeons are the securest the Order has.\nJames is suddenly less excited about this mysterious chance to prove himself.\n\u201cOur Hogsmeade patrol responded to a burst of potent magic earlier tonight and happened across a pair of unusual wizards,\u201d Dumbledore explains. \u201cThey\u2019re still unconscious at the moment but we are having trouble identifying them.\u201d\nJames blinks and re-assesses the assembled Order members. Two long-time teachers at the only magical school in the Isles and the Head Auror, unable to identify someone? Perhaps they\u2019re foreign wizards, except that wouldn\u2019t explain why James or Sirius would somehow be able to accomplish what their elders can\u2019t.\n\u201cHow do you think we can be of assistance?\u201d Sirius asks smoothly while James is still just processing, like an idiot fresh out of school\u2014 which, well, he likes to think that a whole year of adulthood is enough to disqualify him from that category, but these days in the Order, it doesn\u2019t always feel that way.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve determined that they\u2019re not under the influence of polyjuice, glamours, nor human transfiguration. Usually we can assume unrecognizable wizards might be foreign-born or educated abroad, but they bear none of the usual signs. For one, their shoes and clothes, though somewhat strange-looking, all carry labels of British sellers.\u201d\nJames and Sirius exchange a glance at Dumbledore\u2019s fashion assessment\u2014 he\u2019s one to talk\u2014 but allow him to continue.\n\u201cStrangest of all, both bear a shocking resemblance to well-established British wizarding families, but neither Minerva nor I can ever recall meeting them.\u201d\nFinally, it starts to make sense. \u201cYou think one of them\u2019s a Potter?\u201d he clarifies.\n\u201cAnd one of them\u2019s a Black?\u201d Sirius adds with audible distaste.\n\u201cPerhaps not a Black but a Malfoy. Alas, you are the most closely related to the Malfoys of anyone else in the Order, so I am going to have to ask you to bear the mantle of Malfoy Expert for us, for the moment.\u201d\nJames doesn\u2019t even have to look to know the kind of grimace Sirius is making at that. But, \u201cfine,\u201d he says, and Dumbledore leads them down the hallway towards the dungeon stairs. \nBehind them, James hears McGonagall decide she\u2019s no longer needed and take her leave. Moody grunts an agreement but is clearly sticking around for back-up around two unknown prisoners.\nTheir steps echo strangely on the damp stone stairs to the dungeons. Sirius descends them almost silently, which makes James all the more self-conscious of every thump he makes. It\u2019s a bit strange how nervous he is, because it\u2019s not even like he knows for sure the prisoner\u2019s a Potter, but his parents just died less than a month ago and anything to do with family is a bit of a touchy subject for him these days.\nThey reach the bottom of the stairs, which turns left into a short hallway between two rows of stone cells. Only one of them appears to be in use, so they all gather in front of a heavy oak door that Dumbledore spells transparent. \nInside are two boys bound to chairs. It\u2019s hard to see their faces, because both their heads are sagging down towards their chests, but honestly, the hair alone is enough to justify Dumbledore\u2019s suspicions. The boy to the left has ink-black hair the exact same length as James\u2019 \u2014 the only length his locks have ever deigned to grow out to\u2014 and it sticks up at odd angles. The boy on the right is a silky platinum blond, a dead-ringer for the Malfoys.\nThe Potter-haired boy is wearing strange muggle clothes (fine, Dumbledore might have been right about that). Which, yes, Potters generally have no qualms about dabbling in muggle fashion, but these clothes are definitely not fashion. They\u2019re dirty and torn\u2014 and charred?!\u2014 in places and seem to swamp the boy\u2019s small frame. The Malfoy-looking boy, at least, has robes made of expectedly fine, expensive material, if in a slightly unusual cut. Now that James is looking, though, his robes, too, look a bit big on him, like they might have been well-tailored before he lost a stone or so.\nIt\u2019s utterly bizarre because the boy\u2019s too young and skinny to be Lucius; and the one on the left is clearly not James, although he\u2019s the only known Potter under the age of 87 these days.\n\u201cBlimey,\u201d Sirius whispers. James can only nod dumbly in agreement.\n\u201cWhy would anyone try to pose as members of such well-known families?\u201d James mutters. It just doesn\u2019t make sense; it\u2019s a stupid disguise when you could go for non-descript instead, especially when anyone would be suspicious to see a Potter and a Malfoy together, this far into the war...\n\u201cAre they Marked?\u201d Sirius asks.\n\u201cThe, well, for lack of a better identifier, the Malfoy boy is. The Potter one isn\u2019t,\u201d Dumbledore says.\nSome tension that James didn\u2019t even realize he was holding in his gut releases at that. Not that the lack of a Dark Mark automatically means he\u2019s not a Death Eater, but, still. Small mercies.\n\u201cMalfoy hair, Malfoy allegiances\u2026\u201d Sirius shrugs. \u201cLooks like a Malfoy to me. Can\u2019t say I\u2019ve heard of any Malfoys disowned in recent memory, though, which Aunt Druella definitely would\u2019ve ferreted out before she let Narcissa get married. So that\u2019s strange.\u201d\nDisowned? James frowns, but he follows the thought. Potters haven\u2019t been very big on disownment of family for, well, living memory, although technically, these days, living memory just boils down to James and his senile Uncle Charlus, who probably isn\u2019t much longer for this world. Still, though, for a kid this young, James would imagine he\u2019d have heard something about a schism in the last few generations, or maybe a child born out of wedlock. Or even a squib. Although maybe he\u2019s the son or grandson of an older Potter squib whose family line they lost track of?\nRegardless. He feels like he should have come up with some kind of idea of who this boy is. \u201cYou\u2019re sure they\u2019re not wearing disguises?\u201d he says doubtfully. \n\u201cI checked quite thoroughly.\u201d\nJames frowns and squints harder at the Potter-haired boy. From this angle he can just glimpse the black frames of glasses, which also hints at the accursed Potter eyesight. But wigs and specs are easy enough to fake without magic, aren\u2019t they? Unless Lily was having a go at him again?\n\u201cHave you checked his glasses?\u201d he asks Dumbledore.\n\u201cHis glasses?\u201d\n\u201cI mean, are they prescription? If I was a non-Potter trying to pretend to be a Potter, I\u2019d go around in frames filled with regular glass lenses.\u201d\nDumbledore hums thoughtfully. \u201cI found no charms or other spells on them but I\u2019ll admit I did not test their efficacy myself.\u201d\nBefore he\u2019s even made the conscious decision, James has spelled the door open and is walking inside.\n\u201cProngs!\u201d Sirius hisses.\nJames waves him back absently. \u201cThey\u2019re unconscious!\u201d he whisper-yells back. Dumbledore doesn\u2019t protest, so James figures he\u2019s alright to just check those specs real quick.\nHe bends down slightly to tug the glasses off the boy\u2019s face and catches sight of a fresh shiner blooming on the boy\u2019s cheekbone. Ah, well; he\u2019ll only worry about that if the kid turns out not to be a Death Eater after all.\nOne glance through the glasses confirms that they are (1) prescription; (2) of a strong enough prescription to fall within the particular Potter range of visual impairment; and (3) as dirty as the rest of him. James wrinkles his nose and clumsily wedges the frames back onto the boy\u2019s head.\nThe boy seems to stir at the contact to his face, so James wastes no time in high-tailing it back out of the cell and shutting the door behind him. The clang of the lock seems to jolt the boy the rest of the way awake, because his head pops up and James finds himself staring into an eerily recognizable face with incongruously green eyes.\nHis breath catches. Those eyes, they look so familiar but for some reason he can\u2019t place them when they\u2019re set in his own face\u2014\n\u201cBloody hell,\u201d Sirius murmurs. \u201cHe looks just like you, James.\u201d\nJames can only nod.\nThe boy has started struggling against his bonds and looking frantically about the room, swearing vociferously. His gaze lands on the blond boy next to him. \u201cMALFOY!\u201d he yells. \u201cYOU BASTARD!\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Sirius mutters. \u201cAs if we had any lingering doubts about that.\u201d\n\u201cMALFOY!\u201d the boy yells again. He looks much less like a boy now that he\u2019s awake and furious, though. Those eyes alone could age him a decade; they look exhausted.\nThe Malfoy boy starts to stir, now, too; his impatient companion scoots his chair slightly to the right to kick at his ankle with one bound leg.\n\u201cWhere the fuck are we, Malfoy?\u201d\nMalfoy finally pulls his head up with a grimace and blinks uncomprehendingly at his surroundings. \u201cPotter?\u201d he mutters, sounding genuinely confused.\nJames is also genuinely confused. He thinks a part of him is excited to meet a new, unheard-of Potter, although his familiarity with a Death Eater is slightly concerning. Then again, the familiarity does not seem very friendly, so perhaps there\u2019s hope. James glances at Dumbledore and Sirius, both of whom seem equally content to sit back and see what they can learn by observing them through the door.\n\u201cThis thing\u2019s only transparent one-way, right?\u201d James murmurs.\n\u201cNaturally,\u201d says Dumbledore.\nGood. James returns his attention to his strange green-eyed relative, who seems to be on the verge of panic.\n\u201cWhere the fuck are Ron and Hermione?\u201d he snarls.\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know where the fuck we are, Potter!\u201d Malfoy returns. \u201cGive me a bloody minute\u2014 I don\u2019t remember how we got here.\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah right, because I\u2019m just tied up in a dungeon somewhere and you and your daddy\u2019s Death Eater buddies had nothing to do with it.\u201d\n\u201cHe even sounds like you,\u201d Sirius murmurs.\n\u201cWhat? No he doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cHe does. Well, his voice sounds like yours. Accent is terribly common, though.\u201d\nJames has no response to that. \nThe Malfoy boy, at least, sounds like the proper rich ponce he\u2019s expected to be. \u201cHonestly, Potter, the last thing I remember is tracking you through Hogwarts to get my wand back.\u201d\nPotter stills, suddenly, and squeezes his eyes shut. \u201cWe were in the Room of Requirement?\u201d\n\u201cWhat in Merlin\u2019s name is the Room of Requirement?\u201d\n\u201cOh come off it, like you didn\u2019t spend all your free time in there last year fixing your precious vanishing cabinet,\u201d Potter spits.\n\u201cThe Room of Hidden Things?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, whatever.\" Potter's shoulders suddenly tense, and his eyes narrow. \"You jumped me trying to get your wand back,\u201d he accuses.\n\u201cYou stole my wand!\u201d\n\u201cYour family was trying to kill me!\u201d\n\u201cI stalled as much as I could,\u201d Malfoy retorts. \u201cFat lot of good that did me.\u201d\nPotter sighs. \u201cThe Room is the last thing I remember,\u201d he says despondently.\n\u201cMe too.\u201d\n\u201cFuck, but\u2014 RON! HERMIONE!\u201d he bellows. Malfoy winces deeply. \u201cRON!! HERMIONE!! ARE YOU HERE?!\u201d\nMalfoy groans. \u201cShut the fuck up, Potter, I think I hit my head.\u201d\n\u201c\u2014MIONE!!\u2014 What?\u201d\n\u201cI think I hit my head,\u201d Malfoy repeats with audible impatience. \u201cYou shouting a foot from my ear is not bloody helping!\u201d\n\u201cOh, god forbid I give you a headache when you\u2019ve gone and gotten us captured,\u201d Potter snarls.\n\u201cMuggle-raised,\u201d Sirius murmurs. \nJames jumps, startled to be pulled out of this strangely riveting melodrama and back into his own surroundings. He finds himself leaning against the door, face and palms pressed to the transparent wood like glass in a window. \u201cWhat?\u201d he mumbles.\n\u201cHe said god forbid. He must be muggle-raised. Can\u2019t really be a Potter.\u201d\n\u201cCould be descended from a squib Potter,\u201d James offers.\n\u201cHave there been any squib Potters in the last century?\u201d Dumbledore asks curiously.\n\u201cNot that I know of, but,\u201d James shrugs. \u201cCan\u2019t figure out how else\u2014 who else he could be.\u201d\nNobody seems to have additional thoughts at the moment, so they turn their attentions back to the cell. Malfoy seems to have convinced Potter not to shout for his mysterious companions any longer, but they\u2019re only yelling at each other now instead.\n\u201cAs if my father would leave me locked up in a dungeon if we were captured by the Dark Lord\u2019s forces!\u201d Malfoy is protesting.\n\u201cCome off it,\u201d Potter says. \u201cHe knows you could\u2019ve identified me back at the Manor and you didn\u2019t. You might as well be a blood traitor now.\u201d He sounds both pitying and vindicated by this. James only feels increasingly more lost.\nMalfoy is swearing profusely under his breath. \u201cNo,\u201d he finally decides. \u201cWe were obviously both knocked out in an altercation in the Room of Hidden Things. Vince and Greg both think I was hunting you down to turn you over to the Dark Lord. That I didn\u2019t manage it makes me a failure, not a traitor.\u201d\n\u201cLike Voldemort cares about the bloody difference,\u201d Potter mutters.\nJames sucks in a shocked breath. Few people these days are brave enough to say the full name. He glances at Dumbledore, who looks equally surprised at this development.\nMalfoy swears some more.\n\u201cLook, Malfoy,\u201d Potter says wearily. \u201cIf Ron and Hermione\u2014\u201d his voice cracks slightly. He tries again. \u201cIf they made it out alive, then they\u2019ll be coming for me, and they\u2019ll probably call in the whole Order.\u201d\nJames feels his eyebrows creeping up his forehead. Who does this kid think he is that he and his absolutely unheard-of friends could mobilize the entire Order of the Phoenix at the drop of a hat?\n\u201cBully for you,\u201d Malfoy mutters.\n\u201cMalfoy,\u201d Potter repeats, more urgently. \u201cI know you hate being a Death Eater. I know you\u2019re not cut out for torturing people and I know you\u2019ve been punished for it.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you\u2014?!\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Listen. If you help me escape right now, I\u2019ll make the Order take you under their protection.\u201d\nMalfoy sneers, but it doesn\u2019t completely mask his uncertainty. \u201cHow do I know you\u2019re not some trap set by my aunt?\u201d\n\u201cHow do I know you\u2019re not some trap set by your aunt?\u201d\n\u201cBecause the Dark Lord wouldn\u2019t bother? He\u2019d have already killed you himself.\u201d\nPotter hums. \u201cGood point, yeah,\u201d he says. \u201cDunno why he'd have me taken somewhere else when he had a whole army already in place. Unless he decided to go gallivanting across the country checking again on all the ho\u2014 things I stole from him.\u201d He turns pensive while Malfoy gapes. \u201cYou\u2019d think by now, actually, he\u2019d have heard of my capture.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe he\u2019s just on his way.\u201d\n\u201cWell yeah, but I\u2019d have felt it.\u201d\n\n\u201dFelt it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I get\u2014 You know what, don\u2019t worry about it. The point is, this obviously isn\u2019t a trap for me, because why bother, and this is obviously not a trap for you, because nobody would consider using me in any scenario to trick you when I could be much more lucrative turned into Voldemort himself, yeah?\u201d\n\u201cUnless you\u2019re not actually Potter, in which case, it very well could be a trap for me.\u201d\nPotter sighs heavily. \u201cOkay. Erm. Ask me something only I would know then.\u201d\nThere ensues a silence that only grows more awkward the longer it goes on.\n\u201cBit hard to do when we hate each other and only interact in public, huh,\u201d Potter eventually says, which draws a mean snicker from Sirius.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing only you\u2019d know that other people don\u2019t,\u201d Malfoy agrees.\n\u201cOkay, well, how about I just start talking and you let me know when you\u2019re convinced?\u201d\n\u201cAlright then,\u201d Malfoy says doubtfully.\nPotter draws in a deep breath. \u201cThe first time we met was in Madam Malkin\u2019s and you asked if my parents were both magical and then said the \u2018other sort\u2019 shouldn\u2019t be allowed in, and then you saw I was there with Hagrid and insulted him too\u2014\u201d\nMalfoy interrupts with a gasp. \u201cThat was you?\u201d\nFor a moment, Potter looks genuinely taken aback. \u201cWho else did you think I was?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, some other random boy! Why would they send that oaf Hagrid, of all people, to Diagon Alley with their precious saviour?\u201d\nJames blinks. Saviour? At eleven??\n\u201cSee, Malfoy,\u201d Potter says bitterly. \u201cThis is why you\u2019re such an arsehole. Ingrained blood purism aside, Hagrid was my first friend and you insulted him right to my face and you were such a stuck-up self-important eleven year-old that you didn\u2019t even bother asking the name of the kid you were talking to.\u201d\n\u201cOr maybe that wasn\u2019t Potter at all and you\u2019re the actual boy I met at Madam Malkin\u2019s posing as him.\u201d\n\u201cOh, for\u2014 fine. D\u2019you really want me to go into the time you tried to crucio me and I almost killed you in that lavatory?\u201d\nMalfoy turns grey in the face and shakes his head, then winces. \u201cNo. But Snape was there. Try something else.\u201d\nPotter rolls his eyes dramatically. \u201cSpeaking of lavatories, d\u2019you remember when you were hanging out with Crabbe and Goyle in the common room during Christmas Hols second year, and they asked you what you knew about the Heir of Slytherin and then ran off with stomachaches?\u201d\n\u201cWhat the hell, Potter?\u201d Malfoy asks with narrowed eyes. \u201cHow do you know about that? And what does that have to do with lavatories?\u201d\n\u201cIt was actually me and Ron under polyjuice that Hermione brewed in Moaning Myrtle\u2019s loo,\u201d Potter says with vicious glee.\n\u201cAbsolutely not. No way.\u201d\n\u201cYes way. You found us wandering aimlessly around the dungeons and brought us into the common room\u2014 the password was pureblood, which, eurgh\u2014 and then when you said you hoped it would be Hermione who died, Ron got so angry I had to suggest it would be better if the monster killed me instead.\u201d\n\u201cYOU IMPERTINENT, SCHEMING BASTARDS!\u201d Malfoy yells. He starts writhing in his ropes.\nPotter sits back within his bonds, looking extremely pleased with himself. \u201cOf course, you\u2019ve no proof that was really me, either, but if you\u2019re still not convinced, I can continue\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNO, FUCK YOU, POTTER! No one else could possibly possess such disregard for the rules and the hallowed sanctity of the Slytherin common room\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThird year, Hermione punched you in the face and called you a \u2018foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach,\u2019\u201d Potter continues with a contented sigh, ignoring Malfoy\u2019s blustering rage. \u201cI remember every detail of that moment, I assure you; it was the best day of my life.\u201d\n\u201cFine!\u201d Malfoy yells. \u201cFine, Scarhead, you want to prove your identity? At the beginning of last year, I caught you snooping under your invisibility cloak\u2014 eurgh, you really have no respect for other people\u2019s privacy, what the fuck\u2014 and then I broke your hand. Where did I leave your invisible, helpless, petrified body to be found?\u201d\nPotter scowls darkly. \u201cThe Hogwarts Express, and you know as well as I do it was my nose, and fuck you again for that, you prick.\u201d\n\u201cSeems like you are Potter after all,\u201d Malfoy says with a poisoned-honey smile.\n\u201cBloody great. Can we get back to the real problem now?\u201d Potter grumbles.\n\u201cRight.\u201d Malfoy huffs out a steadying breath as his eyes rove the walls of their cell. \u201cI don\u2019t recognize these dungeons. Might be some unfortunate group of snatchers too dumb to recognize either of us?\u201d\n\u201cMy sodding face is plastered along every free wall in Diagon Alley. It\u2019s not even swollen this time.\u201d\nThis must be at least the third time by now that Potter has suggested the entire wizarding world is supposed to recognize him on sight, and James is getting so dizzy trying to keep up with this absolutely bonkers conversation and also try to process the facts in a way that makes sense because you\u2019d think, if everyone knew who this Potter was, then surely James should know him too?? There\u2019s something not adding up but he can\u2019t figure it out and they just keep talking, he wishes they would just give him a few minutes to think\u2014\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Malfoy sighs. \u201cAlso, anyone desperate enough to be a snatcher wouldn\u2019t have access to an actual dungeon.\u201d\n\u201cIs snatching only for the lower-class, then?\u201d Potter sneers.\n\u201cUsually,\u201d Malfoy answers, ignoring the vitriol in the question. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for people to try to worm their way up the Dark Lord\u2019s ranks and into power. But anyone wealthy enough for dungeons has much easier ways of ingratiating themselves with him.\u201d\nPotter frowns in an eerily familiar manner that communicates that he can't argue with the logic, but he's not happy about it. \u201cAlright then. I'm out of ideas.\"\n\u201cNever mind,\u201d Malfoy says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter why we\u2019re here. If you can get me out of these ropes I\u2019ll mastermind your escape, since clearly your three Gryffindor brain cells don\u2019t have the capacity.\u201d\n\u201cBut we would\u2019ve definitely seen him if he was a Gryffindor?\u201d James protests weakly. Sirius grunts in agreement beside him.\n\u201cThree whole brain cells? That\u2019s practically a compliment from you.\u201d Potter wriggles his arms. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure if I just dislocate my shoulder a bit\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Malfoy splutters. \u201cMerlin, Potter, are you insane?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve seen me on the quidditch pitch,\u201d Potter returns cockily. The look on Malfoy's face suggests that Potter\u2019s behaviour on the quidditch pitch does, in fact, support the diagnosis of insanity. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m an old pro at popping it back into the socket\u2014 just gotta\u2014\u201d he shifts around on the seat some more and starts straining his shoulders.\n\u201cDumbledore!\u201d James hisses, pushing himself back and off the door. \u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s time to step in?\u201d\n\u201cDo you think so?\u201d Dumbledore says mildly. \u201cHmm. Yes, I suppose.\u201d He waves his wand at the door. \u201cStay out here for now.\u201d\nThe moment Dumbledore walks into the room, both boys freeze. For that first half-second, Malfoy looks haunted by guilt, and Potter, filled with a combination of hope and something sadder and more intense. Then their expressions shift as one into suspicion, and then, for Potter, rage.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the fuck you\u2019re hoping to accomplish by impersonating Dumbledore, but I can assure you, it is not doing you any favours,\u201d Potter says coldly. \nJames is shocked by the hatred in his eyes. Also by the immediate assumption that Dumbledore is somehow impersonating himself. Equally strange is the fact that Malfoy is shiftily avoiding eye contact with both of them. James wishes he could see the headmaster\u2019s face from this angle, but he can\u2019t.\n\u201cI can assure you, my boy, that I am impersonating nobody but myself.\u201d\n\u201cGet fucked,\u201d Potter spits.\nSirius makes a sound that James translates as I can\u2019t believe anyone, let alone an imprisoned teenager, had the bollocks to tell Dumbledore to get fucked, and I am both appalled and impressed by it. James makes his own noise in return that means I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m related to someone with the bollocks to tell Dumbledore to get fucked, and I am equally appalled and impressed by it.\nSuddenly, Potter stops glaring at the headmaster and jerks his head to the side, now glaring at a nondescript patch of stone wall. \u201cAh, shit,\u201d he mutters with feeling. \u201cShould\u2019ve been practicing this whole time.\u201d\n\u201cForgive me,\u201d Dumbledore says affably, before James can figure out just what Potter was supposed to be practicing. \u201cI only wished to verify that you know who I am. Perhaps a formal introduction would have sufficed. I am Albus Dumbledore, Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m the Prince of Wales,\u201d Potter sneers at the wall.\n\u201cMay I ask for your name?\u201d Dumbledore inquires politely.\nPotter, from what James can see from the side of his face, scoffs and rolls his eyes but says nothing; it's Malfoy who answers. \u201cPlaying that dumb is not a good look for an interrogation,\u201d he says. Potter snorts.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to pardon me for my rudeness if we\u2019ve met before; it must have slipped my mind,\u201d Dumbledore continues, unruffled.\nMalfoy and Potter both stare disbelievingly at Dumbledore. Potter quickly flicks his eyes away, though, back to the wall, then through a low arc to the right until he\u2019s looking at his fellow prisoner. \u201cWhat kind of mind-fuckery do they teach you lot to utilize these days?\u201d he whispers.\n\u201cI swear nobody has ever recommended impersonating a dead headmaster and pretending they don\u2019t know who you are,\u201d Malfoy mutters back.\nDumbledore\u2019s head twitches at the mention of dead headmaster, but otherwise he remains calm. \u201cIt seems my presence has caused some distress,\u201d he finally remarks. \u201cI do apologize. Perhaps, as a token of my goodwill and hospitality, I can bring a healer to look you over?\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps, as a token of goodwill and hospitality, you can dispel these ropes?\u201d Malfoy snarks.\nJames can practically hear the headmaster's eyes twinkling in response. \u201cAlas, I am not quite confident enough in your loyalties to do that; however, I will ensure that you get prompt medical attention.\u201d He sweeps back out of the room before the boys can respond. \nThe door shuts behind him and Dumbledore joins Sirius and James in their observation once more, although he does shoot a Patronus off somewhere, so maybe a healer really is coming.\n\u201cWhat the fuck was that,\u201d Potter mutters.\n\u201cI truly have no idea,\u201d Malfoy says.\n\u201cThe nerve!\u201d\n\u201cThis is not the time for a tantrum!\u201d Malfoy hisses. \u201cWe need to figure out who that was, and then hopefully where we are, and then how we\u2019re getting out!\u201d\n\u201cRight, right.\u201d Potter takes several deep breaths. \u201cOkay, well, I can guarantee you no one in the Order would pull something like that, so, we\u2019re looking at your people.\u201d\n\u201cAre you sure? It sure seems like something your lot would do if they were desperate enough?\u201d\n\u201cWhat is that supposed to mean?\u201d Potter snaps.\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like I wasn\u2019t attempting to kill him a year ago,\u201d Malfoy mutters. James sucks in a sharp breath of surprise. How did he miss news of an assassination attempt\u2014?\nPotter makes a disparaging sort of noise with his throat. \u201cI told everyone who asked that you lowered your wand. No; if anyone\u2019s trying torture or taunt you with Dumbledore, it\u2019s your own people. You did fail the task Voldemort gave you.\u201d\n\u201cFuck,\u201d Malfoy says. Then, after a beat, \u201chow do we know they\u2019re not targeting you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not the one who\u2019s tormented by the very sight of the man!\u201d\n\u201cEveryone knows you had a bunch of special meetings with him last year,\u201d Malfoy presses. A quick glance at Dumbledore and his raised eyebrows suggests that, on the contrary, not even Dumbledore knows about Potter\u2019s alleged special meetings with him last year. Curious. \u201cThere\u2019s all sorts of people who\u2019d be interested in what plans you were making together.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, they think pretending to be him will make me somehow believe he\u2019s miraculously alive and just spill everything we talked about?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say it was a particularly good plan,\u201d Malfoy mutters defensively. \u201cBut there are plenty of followers of the Dark Lord stupid enough to try it.\u201d\nPotter glances over with a wicked glint in his eyes and his mouth open, ready to comment\u2014\n\u201cNO, Potter,\u201d Malfoy growls.\nPotter snickers. \u201cFine. Then who could it be?\u201d\n\u201cSomeone either high enough to be trusted with you on the Dark Lord\u2019s orders, or, perhaps, someone looking to rise in the ranks or, perhaps, exact some kind of personal revenge.\"\n\u201cGreat, so, anyone.\u201d\n\u201cNot anyone,\u201d Malfoy insists. \u201cWas that or was that not a very convincing imitation of Dumbledore?\u201d\n\u201cWhat, so like, someone good enough at transfiguration to pull that off? Because you can\u2019t polyjuice into dead people?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I meant someone with decent enough self-control and acting skills, but yes, that too.\u201d\n\u201cAnyone can pretend to be a friendly old grandpa for two minutes, Malfoy,\u201d Potter huffs.\nMalfoy rolls his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ve met my aunt.\u201d\n\u201cMmm, yeah. Not Bellatrix, then.\u201d\nSirius lets out a long, angry hiss through his teeth. James is struggling to follow his thought process, though. Bellatrix isn\u2019t an aunt. Well, Andromeda has a daughter, but there\u2019s no way Bellatrix would acknowledge Nym as her niece. And also she\u2019s a girl and a Tonks. Except she is a metamorphmagus, so she could look like a boy Malfoy if she wanted, and she could call Bellatrix her aunt if she wanted, but why she would pretend to be a Malfoy is unclear. \nAnd the fact that Bellatrix could be an aunt to a Malfoy in the future through Narcissa is hovering somewhere in the periphery of James\u2019 thoughts but he doesn\u2019t know what to do with that, so maybe there are just other psycho aunts named Bellatrix out there in Voldemort\u2019s forces, who knows?\n\u201cNot any of the Lestranges, really. Not Dolohov, not Macnair, definitely not the Dark Lord himself\u2014\u201d\nPotter shudders. \u201cHe would never.\u201d\nMalfoy looks askance at him for that but shrugs and continues. \u201cSo someone who\u2019s a good enough actor and good enough at transfiguration, but stupid enough to think this ploy would work.\u201d\n\u201cPettigrew,\u201d Potter says with a scary sort of intensity. James\u2019 heart stops for what feels like several beats. He can\u2019t mean\u2014 \u201cWait, no, never mind. Whoever that was, he\u2019s also a legilimens, so add that to your list.\u201d\nJames lets out a shuddery breath and exchanges an equally bewildered look with Sirius. They\u2019ll have to hash that out later.\n\u201dHe\u2019s a legilimens?!\u201d Malfoy screeches. \u201cMerlin\u2019s saggy Y-fronts, Potter, why didn\u2019t you say something earlier?!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m saying it now, aren\u2019t I?\u201d Potter snarls.\n\u201cWell, fuck. Was he good at it? Are you any good at occlumency?\u201d\n\u201cHe was very good at it and I\u2019m utter pants, thanks for asking, so really\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re fucked.\u201d\n\u201cWell, yeah, except I don\u2019t think he tried it after that first time, so.\u201d\n\u201cWhat was he looking for?\u201d\n\u201cMeeting Dumbledore.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re fucked,\u201d Malfoy repeats with a hint of schadenfreude.\n\u201dThe point is,\u201d Potter continues around gritted teeth. \u201cWho do you know that\u2019s good at transfiguration\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOr glamours.\u201d\n\u201c\u2014Fine, or glamours, and also good at acting and legilimency, but comes up with absolutely bonkers plans that nobody would ever fall for?\u201d\nThey\u2019re both quiet for several moments.\n\u201cI\u2019d say Snape, but\u2026\u201d Potter starts. \nJames whips his head around to share a wide-eyed look with Sirius. \u201cSnape!\u201d They whisper-shout in tandem.\n\u201cHe\u2019d never attempt something so idiotic,\u201d Malfoy says superciliously.\n\u201cNot even just to fuck with me?\u201d Potter pushes. \u201cHe\u2019s finally got me prisoner and now he\u2019s got a chance to taunt me with dead people I used to rely on? Don\u2019t tell me he wouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cHe definitely knows at least a dozen potions that could produce a similar effect without having to dress up as the man he notoriously murdered,\u201d Malfoy decides after a minute of thought.\nJames\u2019 blood runs cold. Yeah, Snape\u2019s a right git, and yeah, he\u2019s dangerous with some of the spells he uses, but even the thought of him killing Dumbledore is inconceivable. He shudders.\nExcept, oh yeah, obviously he didn\u2019t kill Dumbledore, because Dumbledore is right here and very much alive, so obviously the prisoners are just off their rockers. Right. Okay.\n\u201cProbably,\u201d Potter sighs. \u201cWell, how do I know we\u2019re not in some kind of potions-induced hallucination anyway? Or that you\u2019re even real?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m real, I can assure you.\u201d\n\u201cYeah but that\u2019s what a hallucination of you would say, too.\u201d\n\u201cSweet Salazar, Potter, we don\u2019t have time for your drivel. If you\u2019re suffering potions-induced hallucinations, there\u2019s no hope for you but outside rescue, so for the moment, you might as well play along.\u201d\n\u201cSays you.\u201d\n\u201cAre you suggesting you know more about potions and torture methods than I do?\u201d\nPotter lapses back into disgruntled silence.\n\u201cIt seems like they really think you\u2019re dead,\u201d Sirius observes.\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d Dumbledore says pensively. \u201cCuriously, the Potter boy does indeed remember meeting me at Hogwarts, although I can\u2019t say I recall the same of him.\u201d\n\u201cI would\u2019ve remembered if he was a student at Hogwarts,\u201d James insists.\n\u201cSame,\u201d says Sirius. \u201cHe looks too much like James.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d Dumbledore repeats.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got no one,\u201d Malfoy eventually decides.\n\u201cYeah, me neither,\u201d Potter says glumly.\n\u201cMust be some kind of thestral,\u201d Malfoy muses.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cSome kind of thestral?\u201d Malfoy repeats. Potter just looks at him blankly. \u201cYou know, invisible but powerful, comes out of nowhere when you\u2019re least expecting them, you never see them until it\u2019s too late?\u201d\nPotter\u2019s face flickers with realization and understanding, and then something akin to humour. \u201cA dark horse,\u201d he mutters, mostly to himself.\nThat comment seems to utterly befuddle Malfoy, who declines to respond.\n\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t they transfigure the hand?\u201d Potter eventually asks into the quiet.\n\u201dThat\u2019s what you\u2019re concerned about?\u201d Malfoy says scathingly.\nPotter just shrugs. \u201cCould be important. Who knows.\u201d\nJames looks at his companions to see that they are equally mystified about the hand comment. They are distracted, though, by a short muffled conversation upstairs, and then Dorcas descends into the tiny hall of the dungeons. Funnily enough, she looks like she\u2019s just come from a pub night too; she\u2019s wearing stylish clothes and her curly black hair is wrapped up in a colorful scarf. The expression on her face is all business, though.\nDumbledore turns from the cell door to greet her. \u201cWe captured two young men earlier this evening who were involved in a mysterious and highly magical event. They\u2019re both conscious now and deeply paranoid, and possibly suffering from some kind of shared delusion that involves my death,\u201d he explains, sounding impressively unaffected by the topic. \u201cThe young man on the right claims to have hit his head and is sensitive to loud noise; the one on the left may or may not have dislocated his shoulder attempting to free himself.\u201d\nDorcas nods stoically. \u201cDo you believe them to be dangerous?\u201d She glances at Sirius and James. \u201cAm I going in with backup?\u201d\n\u201cCaution is always wise but I have yet to see them attempt violence. I believe it best, at the moment, not to overwhelm them with new faces,\u201d Dumbledore says.\nThe three of them step back as Dorcas goes in with her medical kit. Both boys\u2019 eyes narrow in suspicion at her but Potters\u2019 flicker with uneasy recognition, as if he can\u2019t quite place her.\n\u201cHi, my name is Dorcas, and I\u2019m a healer,\u201d Dorcas starts. Potter sucks in a sharp breath but clenches his jaw shut and shakes his head when Malfoy looks questioningly at him. Dorcas hesitates a beat, but continues. \u201cHeadmaster Dumbledore called me in to look you over. I promise I\u2019ve taken my Healer Oaths and I mean you no harm. I\u2019m just here to check you for serious injuries and treat them, that\u2019s all.\u201d\nShe points her wand at Malfoy and he tenses, his face contorting into terror tempered only by resignation. It strikes James as the expression of someone who\u2019s been tortured before and is about to be tortured again. He swallows loudly.\nDorcas isn\u2019t torturing him, though, obviously; she hums to herself as her charms flicker back different colors in different parts of his body. \u201cYou have a concussion, Mr\u2026.?\u201d She starts. Malfoy shakes his head timidly. Dorcas shrugs and turns to rummage around in her kit. \u201cWell. You\u2019re lucky I have the right potions for that on hand; here, start with this, it\u2019s to re-establish the correct levels of chemicals in your brain. This second one will heal any stretching or damage to your brain cells.\u201d\nShe holds the vial up to Malfoy\u2019s lips, which he\u2019s pursing as hard as he can. \u201cI promise it\u2019s just a medical potion,\u201d she says. It changes nothing. Dorcas sighs. \u201cIf you were an ordinary patient you\u2019d be allowed to refuse treatment, but at the moment you\u2019re a captive by an active war force so I\u2019m required to ensure your good health or else we all get pulled in front of the ICW when this is all over. So. You can either drink this yourself or I spell it into your stomach, which, I have to warn you, isn\u2019t exactly a pleasant experience for conscious patients.\u201d\nMalfoy\u2019s mouth remains firmly shut. Dorcas taps the vials, one-two, with her wand and Malfoy lets out a choking sound and grimaces. \nDorcas turns to Potter and holds up her wand. He tenses all over for one small millisecond and then starts writhing frantically within the bonds on his chair. He actually manages to pull one arm out of both its socket and the ropes before Dorcas body-binds him. He glares at her with the rest of his body frozen solid.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Dorcas says, not sounding sorry at all. \u201cI promise I\u2019m not going to curse you.\u201d She proceeds with the same spells as before, although one lights up orange all over his body and another bursts deep black and red from his forehead. James still can\u2019t see her face, but he could swear the tendons in Dorcas\u2019 neck seem to stand out farther with each spell. Finally, she drops her wand and sighs. \u201cYou\u2019re a bit of a mess, huh,\u201d she says kindly. Potter only glares harder at her. \u201cAll I\u2019m going to do is reset your shoulder for the moment, but if you\u2019re captive long-term we\u2019re going to have to treat your malnutrition and get that forehead scar looked at.\u201d\nThis, for some reason, sends Malfoy into hysterical giggles. \u201cGet that forehead scar looked at,\u201d he repeats between gasps for air. \u201cGet that forehead scar looked at!\u201d\nDorcas frowns but otherwise ignores him and goes about restoring Potter to rights and re-binding him to the chair. She twirls her wand sharply at the end of the incarcerous and assures him sternly that even dislocating joints won\u2019t get him out of this one, so please don\u2019t try. She then cuts his sleeve away to rub bruise paste along the shoulder, which she explains will reduce the inflammation around the joint. There seems to be a bit of paste left over on her hand when she\u2019s done, which she dabs onto his purpling cheek for good measure. Potter can\u2019t exactly fight it but he does go cross-eyed trying to keep track of the hand approaching his face. Then she repairs his clothing and finites the body-bind; Potter spits invectives at Dorcas until the door slams shut behind her.\n\u201cMay I ask what else you discovered about Mr. Potter?\u201d Dumbledore inquires.\nDorcas frowns and looks at James. \u201cHuh,\u201d she says. \u201cHe does look like you.\u201d\nJames can only shrug helplessly in reply.\n\u201cWell, he\u2019s got some serious malnutrition going on, and some unusual osteo history. There\u2019s a cut on his forehead that\u2019s both fresh and over a decade old, and both malevolent and protective. So I have no idea what\u2019s going on there\u2014 you\u2019d need to call in a specialist\u2014 but as far as I can tell it\u2019s not actively progressing and he doesn\u2019t appear to be in any pain from it, so.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cI\u2019m not quite sure what to tell you to do about it.\u201d\nDumbledore strokes his beard pensively. \u201cAnd they\u2019re not under the influence of behaviour- or perception- altering potions?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cNaturally-occurring mental disorders?\u201d\n\u201cNone of the most common, at least.\u201d\n \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t discover any traces of appearance-obscuring magic on either of them, did you?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d says Dorcas. \u201cNor any tracking spells or latent transportation magic, although I assume you already checked for that, too.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d Dumbledore affirms. \u201cWell, thank you for your help tonight. Hopefully we will have no further need of healing in the foreseeable future.\u201d\nDorcas nods and walks back out. James returns his attention to the cell. Surprise, surprise: they\u2019re arguing again.\n\u201c\u2014The hell that orange spell was, but if it did something to my entire body it\u2019s probably hard to get rid of,\u201d Potter is saying, sounding on the verge of panic.\n\u201cThat was the same medi spell she did on me, you moron. Only there\u2019s something wrong with your entire body, and she said you're malnourished, and frankly it\u2019s already obvious to anyone with eyes that you\u2019re practically starving.\u201d\n\u201cYou try living in a fucking tent for a year and see how well you eat, Malfoy!\u201d Potter snarls. \u201cWe haven\u2019t all been feasting on the hard work of your house elves this whole time!\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s on you, isn\u2019t it? What\u2019s the point of stealing an elf from my father if you can\u2019t even get it to cook for you?\u201d Malfoy sneers back.\n\u201cDON\u2019T YOU DARE TALK ABOUT DOBBY!\u201d Potter screams. \u201cDOBBY WAS A FREE ELF! HE WAS MY FRIEND AND HE WAS HAPPY AND NOW HE\u2019S DEAD! AND HE DIED RESCUING US FROM YOUR FUCKING MANOR, WHERE YOUR BLOODY AWFUL FAMILY ABUSED HIM FOR YEARS, SO YOU JUST SHUT UP ABOUT DOBBY!\u201d\n\u201cGood Godric,\u201d Sirius murmurs.\n\u201cSalazar's sake,\u201d Malfoy says as well. He looks like he wants to rear back from the tirade but, of course, he isn\u2019t physically able to move like that. Instead, he closes his eyes as if praying desperately for patience. Meanwhile, Potter now looks on the verge of tears, instead of the verge of panic. It\u2019s not exactly an aesthetic improvement.\n\u201cDo the Malfoys have a house-elf named Dobby?\u201d James asks Sirius. It would be nice to know whether literally anything these boys are saying has some basis in reality.\n\u201cFuck if I know,\u201d Sirius mutters back. \u201cYou know I hate all stuffy pureblood elves on principle.\u201d\nJames sighs. It was worth a try.\n\u201cJust,\u201d Potter finally mutters. \u201cJust don\u2019t talk about Dobby. Okay? We still have to figure out how to get out of here anyway.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, alright,\u201d Malfoy agrees warily. \u201cDid you know that mediwitch?\u201d\n\u201cI know who she\u2019s pretending to be,\u201d Potter says grimly. \u201cDorcas Meadowes. Died in the first war. Moody said Voldemort himself did her in.\u201d\nJames attempts to process this last tidbit of information and finally reaches the maximum amount of confusion his brain is able to contain at one time. He throws out his hands to each side. \u201cWhat the fuck is going on?\u201d he whisper-shouts at Dumbledore.\nDumbledore is now stroking his beard and studying the captives thoughtfully. He doesn\u2019t look ready to speak, though, so James turns plaintively to Sirius instead.\nSirius is staring intensely at the two boys, but also glancing between James and Potter with something that looks like mischief. \u201cY\u2019know,\u201d he says, conversationally. \u201cThat Potter bloke really does look a lot like you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve noticed,\u201d James says dryly.\n\u201cExcept for the eyes,\u201d Sirius continues. \u201cNeither you nor your parents nor your Uncle Charlus, for that matter, have green eyes.\u201d\n\u201cYeah? Potters have the hair and the eyesight but nothing about eye color usually stands out in the family line.\u201d\n\u201cNope. Not for Potters, anyway. But pretty green eyes like those? You\u2019ve seen them before.\u201d\nJames frowns at Sirius, then frowns at Potter, who\u2019s once again wriggling at his bonds and having a fruitless row with Malfoy. Whenever he glances at the door, James peers at those eyes and remembers that nebulous sense of familiarity. It\u2019s still niggling at the back of his mind, but not getting any clearer.\n\u201cOh for fuck\u2019s sake,\u201d Sirius huffs. \u201cYou spent the majority of your free time years 4-6 trying to list out romantic-sounding comparisons for Evans\u2019 eyes and now you can\u2019t bloody well remember what they look like?\u201d\nJames sucks in too much air all at once and has to cough some of it out. Now that Sirius has pointed it out, though, the revelation is all he can think about. There\u2019s a Potter boy before him with eyes the exact shade of green as Lily Evans\u2019. In fact, they\u2019re even the same almond shape. \u201cD\u2019you reckon that\u2019s what our kids might look like?\u201d he muses.\nHe doesn\u2019t realize he\u2019s said that out loud until Sirius slaps him across the head. \u201cYou\u2019re being dense, Prongs. That\u2019s a Potter kid with Evans eyes and a Malfoy kid with an Aunt Bellatrix. They both obviously went to Hogwarts, but none of us, not even Dumbledore, has ever seen them before. They claim to know how and when a lot of people we know will die. Put the pieces together, mate.\u201d\nIt takes an embarrassingly long few minutes for James to accept the premise that Sirius is suggesting. \u201cThere\u2019s no way,\u201d he breathes. \u201cThat\u2019s really my kid? And Narcissa\u2019s? From the future? Impossible.\u201d\n\u201cDumbledore?\u201d Sirius prompts.\n\u201cImplausible, but I do so hate to assume that anything is impossible,\u201d Dumbledore offers. \u201cI daresay that much more of what they\u2019ve said makes sense in that context.\u201d\n\u201cNo way,\u201d James repeats dumbly.\n\u201cLet me talk to them,\u201d Sirius suggests in the headmaster's direction. \u201cI know the most about both their families and I\u2019m good at winging it. Maybe I can get more information out of them.\u201d\n\u201cI dunno,\u201d James says. \u201cWe don\u2019t really know much else about them, do we? Just that they think Dumbledore is dead.\u201d\n\u201cWe know Potter\u2019s still involved with, and apparently important to, the Order. And if he\u2019s your kid then I\u2019m definitely his favourite uncle, so he might trust me. And Malfoy\u2019s family is all Death Eaters and he obviously wants to get out, which he probably knows I did better than anyone, so maybe he\u2019ll trust me too.\u201d\nA strange surge of possessiveness sweeps away all of James\u2019 lingering doubts. \u201cIf anyone\u2019s going in interrogating someone who might be my kid, it should be me!\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Dumbledore cuts in, still sounding pensive, \u201cyou might like to speak with them together.\u201d\nJames and Sirius look at each other, shrug in tandem, and head in.\nPotter\u2019s reaction is instantaneous. As soon as Sirius sidles through the door, James behind his shoulder, Potter\u2019s face contorts into the kind of rage Sirius used to channel when he fought with Regulus in the halls. The kind of rage that\u2019s true anger, yes, but also deep hurt. \nIt\u2019s extremely not reassuring.\n\u201cYOU BASTARDS!\u201d Potter roars. \u201cHOW DARE YOU! IF THIS HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH BELLATRIX I SWEAR I\u2019LL TEAR HER GUTS OUT WITH MY BARE HANDS! THAT\u2019S A PROMISE!\u201d\n\u201cWhoa there,\u201d James says, raising his hands gently. \u201cWe come in peace.\u201d\nPotter does not look at all pacified. He is glaring pure murder at Sirius and can\u2019t seem to look at James at all. James tries not to take it personally.\n\u201cIF THIS IS SOME KIND OF SICK TORTURE FOR YOU PEOPLE\u2014\u201d Potter starts again. He\u2019s cut off by a swish of Sirius\u2019 wand; it\u2019s admittedly a nice relief from the yelling but James doubts it will do anything to gain Potter\u2019s goodwill. He\u2019s still ranting and raving under the silencing charm. Malfoy, for the most part, looks deeply unnerved but is studying both of them intently.\n\u201cLook, we think there\u2019s been some misunderstanding,\u201d James explains diplomatically.\n\u201cAnd perhaps some magical mischief involved,\u201d Sirius adds.\n\u201cI\u2019m James Potter,\u201d James says, to be polite, and also because he has no guarantee this Malfoy kid will know who he is.\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m Sirius Black.\u201d\nPotter thrashes so hard his chair screeches back several inches. It\u2019s not promising.\n\u201cAnd today is May 2, 1979,\u201d James finishes.\nBoth boys stare at them incredulously for a long, still moment. Then Potter resumes his thrashing.\n\u201cYou\u2019re barking,\u201d Malfoy finally decides.\nIn response, Sirius casts a verbal ascribo diem. Bright gold letters pop into existence declaring the date May 2, 1979. Sirius twirls his wand to rotate the result, so that the boys can read it properly. \nMalfoy keeps shaking his head as if in a daze. Potter looks utterly unconvinced but at least he\u2019s stopped trying to break his chair.\nSirius is unfazed. He conjures a chair of his own and straddles it backwards to peer intently at Malfoy. \u201cWhat are the odds you\u2019re Narcissa\u2019s kid?\u201d he asks.\nMalfoy just tilts up his chin. \u201cWhat\u2019s it to you?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re cousins then,\u201d Sirius replies. \u201cFirst cousins once removed, that would make us. Can\u2019t say I approve of your father but I got along with Narcissa alright when we were young. If you don\u2019t want to be involved with their ilk, I\u2019m happy to give you tips on how to get yourself disowned from a Dark pureblood family.\u201d\nThe Malfoy boy does not appear at all impressed. \u201cThis is definitely a trap,\u201d he mutters.\n\u201cListen,\u201d James butts in. \u201cI swear we\u2019re not Death Eaters. Look: neither of us are Marked, yeah?\u201d He rolls up his sleeves and waits for Sirius to do the same.\n\u201cSo you\u2019re snatchers,\u201d Malfoy says in a bored drawl.\n\u201cWhat the bloody fuck are snatchers?\u201d\nMalfoy doesn\u2019t answer. When he makes no further move to say anything, James breaks the strange silence. \u201cWe mean you no harm if you mean us no harm.\u201d\n\u201cWe mean you no harm, he says, to the wizards trussed up like turkeys in some dungeon cell,\u201d Malfoy sneers.\nJames just so happens to glance at Potter then, and he could swear he sees the boy mouth something about a peacock. James smirks appreciatively at him, which immediately wipes away any traces of mirth on Potter\u2019s face. Damn.\n\u201cOnly until we can establish you\u2019re not a threat,\u201d James soothes. \u201cWe\u2019re part of an underground group of witches and wizards fighting against Voldemort\u2019s forces. It sounds like you\u2019re not exactly opposed to our goals, so, I say we can help each other out. When are you from? Or, er, what year was it, when you last checked?\u201d\nInstead of responding, Malfoy just mouths James\u2019 last words silently back at him, looking distinctly dumbfounded.\n\u201cLook,\u201d Sirius sighs. \u201cYou two were involved in\u2026 something\u2026 hugely magical earlier tonight and we just want to know who you are and whether it might be dangerous. We don\u2019t yet know what exactly the phenomenon was. I was hoping maybe you could enlighten us.\u201d\n\u201cSo sorry, no idea, can\u2019t help you,\u201d Malfoy says sarcastically. \u201cIf that\u2019s all, you might as well let us go.\u201d\nJames eyes Potter, hoping he might be more reasonable, but the boy\u2019s still glaring daggers at him and Sirius. James runs his hand through messy hair and Potter only seems to glare harder at the affectation. \n\u201cJust, it seems like you two can\u2019t have been born yet, and a displacement of two wizards through that much time would certainly answer our questions about the minor magical explosion you caused, and I think at this point we\u2019re willing to be convinced that\u2019s your story, if you\u2019re willing to be convinced as well.\u201d\n\u201cThis is the barmiest interrogation I have ever been witness to,\u201d Malfoy mutters.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how else to prove to you we are who we say we are and, well, the date\u2019s what we say it is.\u201d\n\u201cTake us to Diagon Alley,\u201d Malfoy says imperiously. \u201cLet us see the latest Daily Prophet for ourselves. Well,\u201d he adds after a beat. \u201cMaybe not Potter, because he has a price on his head. But I\u2019m willing to take the risk for both of us.\u201d\nPotter snarls silently but furiously at Malfoy for that suggestion.\n\u201cOkay, obviously we can\u2019t do that. But I think\u2026\u201d James looks back at Potter wistfully. \u201cI think we could find some common ground, if you let us try.\u201d\nMalfoy only looks more bewildered at that. He turns to look at Potter, who has his lips tucked demonstratively inwards and is shaking his head firmly with a fierce glare.\nSirius sighs impatiently. It\u2019s clear they\u2019re not making much headway by talking at them. \u201cJust think it over, yeah? Talk it over, even,\u201d he flicks his wand at the Potter boy, who\u2019s breathing heavily enough to be heard now. \u201cLet us know if you think we can be of mutual assistance to each other.\u201d \nHe swans with attitude back out of the room. James follows him out after one last rueful glance towards the teenager that might be his son.\nThe door closes and they find Dumbledore has conjured a curved sofa for their viewing comfort. It\u2019s plushy and purple, but that\u2019s not why James is eyeing it wearily. It might as well be embroidered with rainbow letters spelling out it\u2019s going to be a long night. James reluctantly takes a seat.\nA minute or so into their vigil, Potter speaks again. \u201cDon\u2019t tell them anything. Not even the year.\u201d\nMalfoy scoffs. \u201cWhat possible nefarious purposes could they have in mind for which they need you to tell them the blasted year, Potter?\u201d\n\u201cA ransom video? I dunno.\u201d\n\u201cA what?\u201d\n\u201cOh, honestly,\u201d Potter groans. \u201cYou\u2019re such a pureblood twat sometimes.\u201d\nMalfoy smirks. \u201cOnly sometimes?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a horrible git the rest.\u201d\n\u201cWell, here I was about to give you some much-needed advice, but I guess if I\u2019m such a horrible git, maybe I\u2019ll just keep it to myself.\u201d\n\u201cAdvice? If it\u2019s not about getting us the hell out of here, which it\u2019s in your best interests to divulge anyway, then I don\u2019t give a rat\u2019s arse.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s about surviving an interrogation, actually, but fine.\u201d\nPotter glowers at Malfoy, who looks resolutely forward with his nose up in the air. It\u2019s not a great angle for him from James\u2019 point of view, but it seems to annoy Potter, at least.\n\u201cNothing you can say will suddenly make me a master occlumens, so honestly, it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Potter finally decides. He starts jerking at his bonds again. \u201cOur only options are to find a way out of here or last until Ron and Hermione come for me.\u201d\n\u201cHow in Merlin\u2019s name are they going to find you in some dumpy dungeon with a bunch of crazies who like to pretend they don\u2019t even know who you are?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019ll find me,\u201d Potter says with iron faith in his voice. \u201cThey\u2019ll come.\u201d\nThey sit in silence for several more minutes, during which Potter keeps tugging determinedly at his ropes and Malfoy half-heartedly attempts the same for a bit, then gives up.\n\u201cPotter,\u201d he starts. \u201cHave you considered that maybe they\u2019re not lying?\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s not lying?\u201d Potter asks distractedly, glaring at his lap as he kicks his feet.\n\u201cThe\u2014 people. Dumbledore, James Potter, Sirius Black.\u201d\nPotter stills and gapes at his companion. \u201cHave you gone barmy?\u201d \n\u201cI just\u2014! Nothing else comes to mind that makes nearly as much sense!\u201d\n\u201cBut travelling some, oh, twenty years into the past does?\u201d\n\u201cConsidering all the impossible things that happen to you several times a year, Potter? Yeah, actually. Honestly, I\u2019d think you\u2019re due for a mishap in history by now.\u201d\nThere ensues a very expectant silence during which Potter looks interestedly around the very uninteresting dungeon. Stone, a bit of moss, a few cobwebs, some insect carcasses in the corners. Fascinating.\nMalfoy\u2019s jaw drops. \u201cAre you telling me you\u2019ve already had a mishap in history?!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely not telling you that.\u201d A beat. \u201cAnd I wouldn\u2019t exactly call it history seeing as we only went back three hours.\u201d\n\u201dHow?!\u201d Malfoy howls. \u201cWhen? Why? Who\u2019s we?\u201d\n\u201cErm,\u201d says Potter. \u201cThird year? With Hermione? She had a time-turner. Which, by the way, all have limits in hours for how far back you can go; it\u2019s impossible to travel twenty bloody years\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWho could possibly have given Granger a time-turner?!\u201d\nPotter smirks. \u201cThe Ministry and Hogwarts, to let her take more classes, because she\u2019s brilliant. Of course, she brought me along to rescue Sirius, but,\u201d he turns a vicious smile on the other boy, \u201cwe also stole a hippogriff.\u201d\nIt takes approximately three seconds for Malfoy, at least, to understand this reference to a hippogriff, even though James feels quite lost and is honestly much more interested in why Sirius needed rescuing. But apparently that is not of highest importance to Malfoy, who breaks into an ugly flush.\n\u201dYou let that beast get away?\u201d he splutters. Potter laughs. \u201cYou\u2014! Snape was right about you! Just going around breaking laws and stealing off with dangerous creatures wanted by the Ministry and everyone just lets you get away with it because it\u2019s precious Potter\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re one to talk about getting away with bullshit, the way your father ran around that year persecuting Hagrid for nothing but your sick pleasure!\u201d\n\u201cMy sick pleasure!\u201d Malfoy repeats, shrilly and indignantly. \u201cHe brought a murderous ravening beast to a lesson for a bunch of thirteen year-olds! He deserved to be sacked!\u201d\n\u201cBuckbeak wasn\u2019t a murderous ravening beast! You insulted him when Hagrid explicitly told you not to and he barely gave you a scratch!\u201d\n\u201cIt nearly tore off my arm! That thing deserved to be executed!\u201d\n\u201cYou were healed up in ten minutes,\u201d Potter scoffs. \u201cBloody Lockhart\u2019s done worse to me and you know it.\"\n\"Just because we don't all go around getting all the bones in our arms vanished\u2014\"\n\"Bet it wasn\u2019t even about your injury, anyway,\u201d he continues loudly. \u201cYou just couldn\u2019t bear the humiliation of having screamed like a little girl when something finally knocked you down a peg.\u201d\n\u201cI swear to Salazar, Potter, as soon as I\u2019m out of these ropes I\u2019ll tear your eyeballs out with my fingernails,\u201d Malfoy growls.\nPotter only laughs again. \u201cStruck a nerve, have I?\u201d\n\u201cFuck\u2019s sake, go back to talking about Sirius,\u201d James mutters under his breath.\nThey don\u2019t. Another silent glare-off ensues and it lasts, impressively, several minutes, until Potter finally looks back at his ropes. He\u2019s not struggling anymore, but staring down at his chest with a strange look on his face. \n\u201cIs he trying to do wandless magic?\u201d Sirius guesses.\n\u201cJust looks a bit constipated to me,\u201d James observes.\nSirius snorts. \u201cThat\u2019s how you look when you\u2019re concentrating, Prongs.\u201d\n\u201cIs not!\u201d\n\u201cIs too. Exactly the same. Uncanny, really.\u201d\nJames smacks him upside the head. Sirius only sniggers.\n\u201cNew plan,\u201d Potter announces. \u201cScoot your chair over here and untie me.\u201d\n\u201dYou come over here and untie me!\u201d\nPotter rolls his eyes. \u201cYou literally just said that as soon as you\u2019re untied you\u2019ll rake my eyes out, or something equally vicious that you\u2019re definitely too squeamish to actually follow through on\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIf I\u2019m too squeamish to do it, then there\u2019s no reason I can\u2019t be untied first, then, is there?\u201d Malfoy retorts.\n\u201cFucking\u2014 fine,\u201d Potter huffs. \u201cI\u2019ll untie you, because you\u2019re probably shit at it anyway. Then you untie me, because you know you\u2019ll never make it out of here alone, even if you won\u2019t admit it, and then when we\u2019re good and shot of these fucking dungeons I\u2019ll let you take your best swing at me over Buckbeak, which I\u2019m not at all worried about because neither of us has a wand, pureblood ponces like you have shit form for muggle brawling, and I\u2019m very good at dodging punches.\u201d\n\u201cSalazar\u2019s sake, Potter, that\u2019s how you bargain? You wouldn\u2019t last a day in Slytherin,\u201d Malfoy drawls, but he doesn\u2019t sound exactly opposed to the idea.\nPotter laughs, already kicking his legs and twisting awkwardly. The chair moves about an inch to the right. \u201cTell that to the Sorting Hat.\u201d\nMalfoy\u2019s brow furrows, and then he gapes horribly. \u201dYou? In Slytherin?\u201d\nPotter laughs again. The chair screeches another two inches over. \u201cI asked it not to though, so it put me in Gryffindor.\u201d\n\u201cWhy in Salazar\u2019s castle would you possibly pick Gryffindor over Slytherin?\u201d\n\u201cWell, a certain poncy blond git had just gotten sorted there, hadn\u2019t he? And I couldn\u2019t bear the thought of dealing with your presence all the time. Not after you were so rude to Ron.\u201d\nMalfoy flushes even more unattractively than he had over whatever that hippogriff bit was. \u201cYou rejected all of Slytherin House because I was mean to a Weasley on the train?\u201d\nPotter manages several inches on his next scoot. \u201cI don\u2019t like bullies,\u201d he says bitterly.\n\u201cFuck me,\u201d Malfoy moans. \u201cIf it ever gets out I single-handedly pushed the most famous wizard of our age away from Slytherin House, my reputation will never recover.\u201d\nPotter snickers. \u201cI mean, Voldemort sure didn\u2019t help any. But yeah.\u201d He finally manages to close the distance between them and grunts some more as he twists his chair around to get ahold of the ropes around Malfoy.\nJames shoots a worried glance at Dumbledore, who waves an unconcerned hand. \u201cThose ropes cannot be untied nor loosened without magic,\u201d the headmaster says.\nSirius hums in acknowledgement. James turns his eyes back to his probably-son, who fumbles with the ropes fruitlessly for several minutes before Malfoy speaks again.\n\u201cListen. About the time travel theory.\u201d\n\u201cNot this again!\u201d\n\u201cOh, could you stop being such a paranoid bastard for one second and hear me out?\u201d\n\u201dParanoid bastard?\u201d Potter shrieks. \u201cParanoid bastard? You spend ten months as bloody Undesirable Number One and then talk to me about paranoia! You survive the number of murder attempts I have, and then talk to me about paranoia! Hell, the number of murder attempts by my own professors\u2014!\u201d\n\u201cAlright, alright!\u201d Malfoy interrupts. James realizes he is probably cutting off the circulation in Sirius\u2019 arm, he\u2019s gripping it so hard. Sirius, good mate that he is, hasn\u2019t even complained. \u201cI take it back about the paranoia. You\u2019ve earned it.\u201d\n\u201cDamn well I\u2019ve earned it,\u201d Potter grumbles.\n\"Yes, fine, but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not paranoid! Honestly, if you keep this up, you\u2019ll end up worse than Mad-Eye Moody.\u201d\n\u201cMad-Eye kept a lot of people alive,\u201d Potter says fiercely. \u201cBut go on, keep insulting my dead and see if I help you out of these ropes.\u201d\n\u201cBloody hell,\u201d James mumbles. \u201cIs there anyone left who isn\u2019t dead?\u201d\nMalfoy only scoffs with offense. \u201cYou have to admit he was insane! He turned a fourteen year old student into a\u2014!\u201d\nJames can\u2019t figure out why Malfoy has suddenly stopped talking. That is, until an enormous, devious smile spreads across Potter\u2019s face. \u201cSay it, Malfoy,\u201d he taunts.\n\u201cYou know what he did,\u201d Malfoy mutters.\n\u201cSay it!\u201d\n\u201cFuck off!\u201d\n\u201cFerret!\u201d Potter supplies gleefully, and then breaks into gales of full-blown laughter.\n\u201cFuck you, Potter, I\u2019ll turn you into a ferret!\u201d Malfoy growls, flushing fiercely.\n\u201cOh, man, I can\u2019t believe you brought that up yourself,\u201d Potter gloats. Malfoy descends into increasingly violent curses and threats. \u201cTalk about the other best day of my life. I\u2019d be wiping tears off my face right now if I wasn\u2019t bloody tied up.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll wipe all the skin off your face if you don\u2019t shut up right now!\u201d\nPotter chortles one last time. \u201cOh Merlin. What a great memory for these dark times. Anyway, if you\u2019ll recall, the real Moody never turned you into a ferret at all; it was Barty Crouch.\u201d\nThe shock seems to pull Malfoy abruptly out of his sulk. \u201cThe Head of International Magical Cooperation?\u201d\nUnsurprisingly, Malfoy only gets angrier when Potter blinks and then guffaws some more. \n\u201cYou know, for someone whose personal catchphrase as a kid was \u2018my father will hear about this,\u2019 you sure didn\u2019t hear much from him in return. You are drastically underinformed.\u201d\n\u201cLess gloating, more untying, Potter,\u201d Malfoy demands.\n\u201cAlright then,\u201d Potter says happily. \u201cFeel free to just sit there and wonder how the most straight-laced official in the entire Ministry went so wrong.\u201d\nMalfoy lasts an impressive three minutes of Potter silently picking at his ropes before his outburst. \u201cFine!\u201d he yells. \u201cSince you\u2019re obviously always right in the sodding middle of everything that can possibly go wrong, bloody, explain it to me then.\u201d\nPotter smirks. \u201cExplain what?\u201d\n\u201cExplain what Crouch was doing impersonating a Hogwarts professor!\u201d\nPotter tsks condescendingly. \u201cThat\u2019s not how the story came up though, is it?\u201d\n\u201cI swear to Salazar, Potter, I will murder you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAlright, alright, no need to get all worked up. I\u2019ll explain the Ferret Incident in all its gory detail.\u201d\n\u201cYou pompous, condescending, infuriating nitwit!\u201d\n\u201cDamn, Malfoy, tell me how you really feel.\u201d\n\u201cPOTTER!\u201d\n\u201cAlright, alright,\" Potter says. For someone tied to a chair in a dungeon (and not the fun kind), he sure appears to be enjoying himself. \"The thing is, Moody that entire year wasn\u2019t Moody at all, but Barty Crouch. Junior.\u201d\nMalfoy scoffs. \u201cHe died in Azkaban.\u201d\n\u201cDid he?\u201d\n\u201cFuck you, Potter, just explain.\u201d\nAfter one last victorious, condescending grin in Malfoy\u2019s direction, Potter finally starts to talk in earnest. He proceeds to tell a story of a mother\u2019s love, a prison break, an unforgiveable, a missing ministry official, a scapegoated house-elf at a World Cup, an attack on an ex-auror, a kidnapping plot, a Triwizard Tournament, a necromancy ritual, and an extrajudicial execution via dementor. \nIt sounds like the kind of story Sirius used to weave to distract hapless new Defense teachers from half a day\u2019s worth of lessons. Frankly, it\u2019s unbelievable, except that Potter\u2019s face is grim and deadly serious throughout the entire retelling.\n\u201cYou realize literally all of your stories sound like a four year-old made them up,\" Malfoy drawls. James smirks to himself at the unwitting comparison of Sirius to a four year-old.\n\u201cBlame your Lord, not me.\u201d\n\u201cCirce's tits,\u201d Sirius breathes. \u201cCan we go back to the theory that they\u2019re both just stark raving mad?\u201d\nMalfoy humphs. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand is how you can have lived through, what, seven full years of such ridiculously contrived plots to kill you and yet you refuse to consider the possibility of time travel.\u201d\n\u201cOh, for fuck\u2019s sake, Malfoy!\u201d\n\u201cJust!\u201d Malfoy insists. \u201cRationally speaking, what possible advantage would they get out of pretending not to know the Boy Who Lived?\u201d\n\u201cBoy Who Lived?\u201d James whispers. He can practically hear the capitalizations in Malfoy\u2019s voice and it sends ominous goosebumps across his arms.\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to trip us up.\u201d Potter says this as if it should be obvious.\n\u201cThey\u2019d do a much better job of tripping us up if they pretended to be those people and also knew who we are,\u201d Malfoy argues. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to tell me you\u2019d be less vulnerable to emotional manipulation if all your dead father figures came in and told you they love you and miss you and wanted to hear what you\u2019ve been up to since they died?\u201d\n\u201cYou shut the fuck up Malfoy!\u201d Potter snarls, practically in his ear. Malfoy snaps his mouth shut with an audible click.\n\u201cProngs?\u201d Sirius sounds uncharacteristically timid in the resulting silence.\nJames only shakes his head; it\u2019s all he can acknowledge right now.\n\u201cYou realize there\u2019s an easy way to prove their identity?\u201d Malfoy prompts, voice extremely even.\n\u201cBy all means, enlighten me,\u201d Potter says sourly.\n\u201cJust ask them questions only they would know the answer to, like we did.\u201d\nExcept for the occasional frustrated curse, Potter is quiet for a few minutes, picking at Malfoy's ropes. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he finally admits. He sounds small and vulnerable in those two words, and James instinctually hates it.\n\u201cWhat do you mean you can\u2019t?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a single thing that I know about either of them from the first war that any old Death Eater couldn\u2019t find out.\u201d\n\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d Malfoy huffs. \u201cHe\u2019s your father!\u201d\n\u201cAm I or am I not famously an orphan?\u201d Potter snarls.\nJames chokes. Sirius suddenly has his wrist in a bone-crushing grip.\n\u201cHe\u2019s still your father! And your\u2014 whatever Sirius Black was to you; Mother never wanted to get into it,\u201d Malfoy ends on a mutter.\n\u201cMy godfather,\u201d Potter whispers. His eyes are unfocused and he sounds ineffably sad. Something sinks inside James\u2019 chest.\nSirius leaps to his feet. \u201cI\u2019m going back in,\u201d he declares. James grabs his arm and pulls him back down onto the couch.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t mean I know anything about him,\u201d Potter continues.\n\u201cYou knew Black, though, right?\u201d\nPotter sighs bitterly. \u201cFor two years. And, I repeat, anything he could have told me about my dad, Wormtail could have told the Death Eaters.\u201d\nJames chokes again. All the air in the small dungeon hallway seems to have vanished. Sirius stands abruptly before James can make another grab for his arm and opens the door.\nDamn. Sirius gets like this, sometimes, when he\u2019s worried or upset; he just barges into whatever mad plan he thinks will make things better and usually leaves a trail of chaos and detentions in his wake.\nStill, James would never let him do any of it alone. He slips into the cell after him.\n\u201cSo we\u2019re both dead where you\u2019re\u2014 erm, when you\u2019re from, then?\u201d Sirius opens, with absolutely no tact.\nOn the bright side, Potter seems at least a little bit curious about the time-travel thing, maybe, because he doesn\u2019t immediately start yelling at them again. Or more likely, judging by the look on his face, he\u2019s very aware of the incriminating position he\u2019s been found in, hands mere centimetres from Malfoy\u2019s ropes. Fortunately for him, Sirius is much too worried about other issues to call him out on that.\n\u201cYes,\u201d says Malfoy.\n\u201cMalfoy!\u201d Potter hisses.\n\u201cWhat? If we\u2019re really in our time, everyone already bloody knows that anyway.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re just trying to get you comfortable with answering their questions.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe they\u2019ll let us be more comfortable if we do!\u201d\n\u201cAhem,\u201d Sirius says loudly. \u201cI think we\u2019d very much like to know how we died.\u201d\nJames puts a warning hand on his shoulder. He doesn\u2019t expect it to really help.\nMalfoy studies Sirius suspiciously, then cranes his neck around to an angle that can\u2019t possibly be painless to whisper something in Potter\u2019s ear. Potter twitches and looks at him with incredulous eyebrows raised, and Malfoy whispers something else at him. Potter fights him on it, brows furrowing, but Malfoy keeps hissing insistently back, and then Potter appears to give in.\nAfter a long, contemplative pause, Potter looks back at James and Sirius. It\u2019s suddenly extremely unnerving to be the sole object of his attention. James does not like looking at eyes so similar to Lily\u2019s holding such hurt and suspicion. \nFinally, he speaks. \u201cPeter Pettigrew is a Death Eater.\u201d\n\u201cFuck,\u201d says Sirius.\n\u201cNo,\u201d James protests, though it comes out more as a whimper. \u201cNo,\u201d he repeats, but he still can\u2019t make it sound like he means it, because hasn\u2019t Potter dropped enough hints already? But that doesn\u2019t means it\u2019s true, doesn\u2019t mean James has to believe it\u2014\nBut Potter continues to speak, slowly and clearly and surely, his calculating eyes assessing Sirius and James in turns. \u201cWhen my parents, Lily and James Potter, went into hiding, Pettigrew turned their location over to Voldemort. I was still a baby when he came to the house and personally murdered my parents.\u201d His voice turns hard. \u201cHe killed my dad first. His last words were \u2018Take Harry and run. Go. I\u2019ll hold him off.'\u201d\nIt takes a moment to register over the thrumming of his gaping dread, but James realizes he finally has a name for this Potter boy. \u201cHarry,\u201d he breathes. It\u2019s just a tiny little nugget of warmth amidst the cruelty spilling from his child\u2019s mouth, but he grabs ahold of it tightly. \u201cMy grandpa Henry used to go by Harry as a kid.\u201d\nA flicker of something like doubt wavers behind Harry\u2019s eyes, but he blinks it away and continues. \u201cVoldemort found my mum in the nursery, in front of my crib. She pled for my life; he told her to step aside and she refused. He killed her, and then tried to kill me. For years I thought I was too young when they died to remember anything from that night but a flash of green light. Then I got too close to a dementor, and I heard my parents\u2019 last words.\u201d\nMalfoy lets out a little guilty-sounding \u201coh,\u201d but he\u2019s ignored. Harry\u2019s gaze lingers on James, who already feels like he\u2019s drowning under the horror of this story, unable to breathe. Sirius, though, manages to suck in a shaky breath, and it seems to finally turn Harry\u2019s attention to him.\n\u201cSirius Black found me alive in the blown-up nursery, but he abandoned me to go chase after Pettigrew. He was the only one left, you see, who knew that Pettigrew had been my family\u2019s Secret Keeper. But when Sirius finally had him cornered, Pettigrew yelled for all the witnesses to hear that it was Sirius who had betrayed my parents; then he blew up the entire street to fake his death, and slipped away down some sewer pipe. Sirius was just standing there, laughing like a maniac, when the Aurors showed up. Voldemort\u2019s right-hand man, they called him. He spent the next twelve years in Azkaban without trial.\u201d\nAgain, Harry falters; he\u2019s been staring avidly at Sirius the whole time he\u2019s been telling his story and James could swear his entire face has creased with doubt every time Sirius flinched. \nHarry looks at Malfoy for reassurance. Malfoy doesn\u2019t turn back around to whisper to him, but he does say, quietly, \u201cthey really don\u2019t look like they\u2019re acting. Or like they knew any of this before.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry murmurs.\n\u201cFinish the story,\u201d Sirius demands. His voice sounds odd. James finally tears his eyes away from his son\u2014 his orphaned, grown-up son\u2014 to look properly at his best mate. Sirius is trembling all over and his eyes are wild; like, \u2018fresh onto the Hogwarts Express after a whole summer with Walburga\u2019 wild.\nHarry studies him quietly for a moment, but continues. \u201cSirius escaped from Azkaban eventually to come after Wormtail, who had been masquerading as a child\u2019s pet. He briefly got ahold of him during a confrontation in which my friends and I and Lupin learned the truth, but Pettigrew got away. He ran off to locate Voldemort and a year later Pettigrew helped him resurrect himself.\u201d\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t I kill him when I had the chance?\u201d Sirius whispers brokenly.\n\u201cI told you not to,\u201d Harry says with a strange note in his voice that James can\u2019t possibly hope to identify. \u201cI didn\u2019t want you to become murderers. I was going to hand him over to the dementors.\u201d He barrels on over Sirius\u2019 angry mutters, now splitting his gaze between Sirius and James again. \u201cHe\u2019s dead now, though. I watched it happen. Maybe even made it happen, I think. I\u2019m not sure. He was strangled to death by his own magical hand.\u201d\nJames feels extremely queasy. He can\u2019t quite fathom the depths of what this boy\u2014 his boy\u2014 has suffered, let alone process Peter\u2019s betrayal, Sirius\u2019 injustice, James\u2019 own untimely murder. His head is spinning and Harry is still just looking at him with Lily\u2019s eyes and worse, James honestly has no idea what Harry\u2019s seeing; he can\u2019t feel his own face enough to guess at his expression.\n\u201cAlright then,\u201d Harry says quietly. \u201cProve it\u2019s really you.\u201d\n\u201cHow?\u201d asks James.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Harry admits. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nJames frowns. The Order has been working off of security questions lately, but it\u2019s not the only system they have in place. He draws his wand and winces at Harry\u2019s flinch. \u201dExpecto Patronum,\u201d he casts.\nHis ethereal stag leaps out of the wand and canters right up to Harry. The boy fights momentarily against his ties, as if he forgot he was bound and tried to reach out to Prongs. Immobile as he is, all he can do is stare with lips slightly parted and eyes shining.\nWhen the stag finally fades away, Harry blinks rapidly, clears his throat, and turns to Sirius. \u201cNow you,\u201d he demands.\nSirius obliges and his familiar wolf pops out. Harry stares at it in shock which quickly morphs into suspicion.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not Padfoot,\u201d he accuses.\n\u201cOf course not.\u201d Sirius sounds as confused as James feels. \u201cIt\u2019s Moony.\u201d\nThe suspicion eases, which is nice, but Harry looks even more bewildered than the rest of them. After several speechless seconds, he manages to ask, \u201cwhy would your Patronus be Moony?\u201d\nSirius shrugs. \u201cHe\u2019s mine and I\u2019m his. Always have been.\u201d\nThe longer Harry stares, the uneasier James feels about it. The kid said Remus was still around, didn\u2019t he? And he found out Sirius was innocent? Why wouldn\u2019t he know Sirius\u2019 Patronus is Moony? Why would it be such a surprise??\n\u201cYou know your Patronus isn\u2019t always your\u2014\u201d James cuts himself off before he and Sirius manage to incriminate themselves in front of Dumbledore. \u201cI mean, it can represent lots of things. Your inner character, or who you love, or, erm, other things.\u201d\nHarry\u2019s eyes are wide and only growing wider. James could swear he\u2019s mouthing who you love to himself. It\u2019s not doing anything to help the unease in his gut.\n\u201cFuck,\u201d Sirius says quietly. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know about me and Moony?\u201d\n\u201cThis is not happening right now,\u201d Malfoy mutters.\nHarry clears his throat and frowns. \u201cI never\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDid he move on?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t\u2026\u201d Harry shakes his head helplessly. \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone he was with when you were alive. But if you two got back together, you never told me.\u201d\n\u201cWhen I was alive?\u201d Sirius echoes hollowly. \u201cHe\u2026 after I was dead?\u201d\nHarry looks away and shrugs awkwardly.\n\u201cWas it serious?\u201d \n\u201cObviously it wasn\u2019t you,\u201d James quips. Sirius punches him quite hard in the stomach for that, but James reckons, upon further thought, that he probably deserved it.\n\u201cErm, you could say that,\u201d Harry answers, his voice high and uncertain.\n\u201cThis is not happening,\u201d Malfoy mutters to himself. \u201cI am not here for this.\u201d\nSirius hunches his shoulders, rests an elbow on one crossed forearm, and pinches his nose. \u201cJust tell me.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2026 married and had a kid,\u201d Harry admits. Sirius lets out a noise like he\u2019s been punched. \u201cAlthough\u2014\u201d Harry starts, sounding desperately uncomfortable, \u201cit\u2019s possible he only got married because of the kid. I mean, it all happened pretty fast, but\u2014\u201d\n\u201cPlease stop,\u201d Sirius begs. Harry shuts up immediately, looking guiltily relieved.\n\u201cDid my Patronus change?\u201d Sirius asks, ever softer and more unsure.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Harry admits. \u201cI never saw your Patronus.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you said you knew me for two years?\u201d\n\u201cI mean yeah, but after so long in Azkaban\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHe never said that,\u201d Malfoy interrupts loudly. \nBollocks.\nHarry jerks his head up to glance sharply at the back of Malfoy\u2019s head, then even more sharply at Sirius and James, and back. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou said that to me earlier but not to them just now. They\u2019ve been watching us.\u201d\nIt hurts, this time, to see Harry\u2019s eyes narrow in suspicion. He starts struggling with his ropes again. James feels inexplicably devastated, like he\u2019s let his son down, even though all he\u2019s done is follow Order protocol and observe unknown entities for possible signs of their loyalties.\n\u201cFine then,\u201d Harry says nastily. \u201cProve you\u2019re who you say you are. Show me the real Prongs and Padfoot.\u201d\nAll James does is glance uncertainly at Sirius, but apparently it\u2019s enough to prove their guilt.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t, can you? Because either you\u2019re not really you, or someone else is watching us, even now, and you don\u2019t want them to know.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014\u201d James runs an anxious hand through his hair, feeling, not for the first time, like the night is spinning rapidly out of his control. \u201cLike I said, we didn\u2019t know who you were\u2014\u201d\n\u201cFuck off,\u201d Harry spits. \u201cI don\u2019t trust them,\u201d he says to Malfoy.\nThe door opens and Dumbledore enters.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Harry and Malfoy mutter in tandem. Then they immediately look at each other in mutual disgust.\n\u201cI do apologize for my rudeness, but I won\u2019t deny that I consider the eavesdropping an unfortunate necessity during these uncertain times,\u201d Dumbledore announces without preamble. \u201cOtherwise, I fear, the very act of observation would disturb the observed system, no?\u201d\nJames blinks at Dumbledore with a bemusement echoed by Sirius and Malfoy. Harry doesn\u2019t seem unfamiliar with whatever theory Dumbledore is spouting, but he looks nevertheless unimpressed.\n\u201cSo kind of you to make your presence known,\u201d Malfoy drawls after a beat. \u201cDoes this mean we\u2019re trusted enough to be informed of your observation?\u201d\n\u201cIn a manner of speaking,\u201d Dumbledore says.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Harry says. \u201cOkay.\u201d He sounds like he\u2019s trying to reassure himself. \u201cI can work with this.\u201d He pins Dumbledore with that same calculating gaze; James shivers with relief not to be subject to it this time. \u201cWhen you visited Tom Riddle to deliver his Hogwarts letter, how did you prove to him that magic is real?\u201d\nDumbledore\u2019s feathery eyebrows rise, but he otherwise remains composed. After a beat of assessing Harry right back, he answers. \u201cI alerted him to the presence of several objects in his possession which did not, in fact, belong to him.\u201d\nHarry scowls at the answer, narrows his eyes further, and says, after an unnervingly pregnant pause, \u201cdid you or did you not set his bed on fire?\u201d\nDumbledore\u2019s lips thin. \u201cI did not,\u201d he finally answers. James lets out a breath of relief only to find that he has reacted too soon. \u201cIt was his wardrobe.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Sirius mutters to nobody in particular. \u201cWhat happened to transfiguring teacups?\u201d\nEveryone else, thankfully, ignores him.\n\u201cAnd what rune did you hide in your signature when you were writing letters to teenage Grindelwald?\u201d Harry asks.\nAnother trick question, James thinks, but at least a funny one. Or, at least, it would be funny if Dumbledore hadn\u2019t just paled dramatically, and also, James would swear his eyes just flashed. James chokes on air.\n\u201cNo way,\u201d Sirius mutters. Once again, he is ignored.\n\u201cThe symbol of the deathly hallows, in the window of the A,\u201d Dumbledore says.\n\u201cHalf the wizarding world has read that book, Potter,\u201d Malfoy grouses.\nDumbledore twitches something awful. James feels increasingly out of his depth trying to follow this conversation.\n\u201cLike you said, Malfoy. It\u2019s not about the information but their reaction,\u201d Potter mutters back.\nMalfoy looks genuinely impressed before he catches himself and sticks his nose in the air. \u201cAbout time you acknowledged my superior advice.\u201d\n\u201cI must admit you seem to have me at a disadvantage,\u201d Dumbledore interjects. \u201cYou know much about me and yet I know so little about either of you.\u201d\n\u201cNot a nice feeling, is it?\u201d Harry says bitterly. \u201cBut maybe if you sit out there spying on us long enough, you\u2019ll hear something useful.\u201d\n\u201cAllll-right,\u201d James butts in. \u201cWe aren\u2019t going to be best mates in a night\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNot when you\u2019ve got us tied up in a dungeon,\u201d Malfoy says with sickly sweetness.\n\u201c\u2014But we\u2019ve got to start somewhere,\u201d James continues, undeterred.\n\u201cYou could try untying us.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll untie you when I\u2019m convinced you\u2019re convinced we\u2019re on the same side.\u201d\nMalfoy sneers some more but cranes his head around to look at Harry, who\u2019s still sitting perpendicular to Malfoy\u2019s back. Harry sighs and starts throwing his weight around to scoot into a more comfortable place from which to speak quietly with him. Sirius levitates his chair gently into position, which, alas, doesn\u2019t seem to endear him to Harry at all. James backs away from the captives and leans against a wall, gesturing for Sirius and Dumbledore to join him.\nOnce they're content with the space they've been afforded, Harry and Malfoy begin a whispered conversation which quickly devolves into a hushed, but still perfectly audible, shouting match.\n\u201c\u2014Which you\u2019d know if you\u2019d paid attention in Potions at all, Potter.\u201d\n\u201cOh, you mean if you hadn\u2019t been sabotaging my cauldrons at every possible opportunity? Or do you mean if the class had been taught by someone who wasn\u2019t a traitorous lying Death Eater with a personal grudge against me just because I look like my father?\u201d\n\u201cSure, blame everyone but yourself! Honestly, it\u2019s a simple fucking brew; any middling dunderhead would be able to tell you how to make it.\u201d\n\u201cSorry we don\u2019t all grow up with our own private potions labs in the nursery and Potions Masters for godfathers,\u201d Harry snarks.\n\u201cGodfather? Please. Just because all the insane rumours about you in school turned out to be true doesn\u2019t mean that one is.\u201d\n\u201cYou say that like I didn\u2019t literally watch you and Parkinson feed straight lies to Rita Skeeter in fourth year.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m quite sure you didn\u2019t!\u201d\nHarry snorts. \u201cGive it up Malfoy, I know she\u2019s an animagus. Hermione kept her in a jar that whole summer.\u201d\nAll of a sudden, James finds himself extremely grateful that his animagus form is too large to fit in a jar. From the faintly greenish tinge of Sirius\u2019 cheeks, he is thinking along the same lines.\n\u201cGranger?!\u201d Malfoy chokes. He almost sounds\u2026 impressed. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t think she had it in her,\u201d he says faintly.\n\u201cSkeeter finally stopped spreading lies about me all across the front page, didn\u2019t she?\u201d\n\u201cCome off it; you love the attention.\u201d\n\u201cI assure you, Malfoy, I really don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cWere you or were you not handing out signed photographs as a second year?\u201d\nHarry splutters indignantly. \u201cI wasn\u2019t! That was entirely a mortifying misunderstanding caused by the unholy trinity of you, Colin, and Lockhart, and I never wanted any part of it!\u201d\n\u201cPlease. Nobody gets into as many public death-defying stunts with dragons as you do without a genuine desire for attention,\u201d Malfoy scoffs.\n\u201cI just explained how I was forced into the Triwizard Tournament against my will.\u201d\n\u201cFine! Then explain the one you rode out of Gringotts!\u201d\nJames\u2019 eyebrows shoot up his forehead and he turns his head to share a glance with Sirius. James\u2019 look is saying who the hell raised my child and let him commit death-defying stunts with dragons and steal them from Gringotts? Alas, he finds no helpful answers in Sirius\u2019 returning look, which only says, definitely Marauder spawn.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have a choice. We needed something from a vault. I can\u2019t tell you more than that,\u201d Harry warns darkly.\n\u201cOoh, look at me, I\u2019m Harry Potter and I have top-secret important missions that I can\u2019t tell anyone about! I\u2019m so special I just go around stealing dragons and robbing Gringotts and inciting goblin wars!\u201d Malfoy mocks in a deep voice. \u201cBut noo, of course I don\u2019t have some sort of pathological need for attention!\u201d\n\u201cAre you hearing yourself?\u201d Harry exclaims. \u201cYou only think I love the attention because that\u2019s all you\u2019ve ever wanted!\u201d\n\u201cI've never needed it, because, unlike you, I don't have some kind of poor abandoned orphan complex where I need everyone else's love and admiration to make up for my lack of parents!\"\n\u201cOh, please. If you\u2019d tried any harder to be the center of attention you would\u2019ve single-handedly established the Hogwarts Drama Club.\u201d\n\u201cYou say that like you weren\u2019t the single biggest source of drama in the whole school for the entire six years you were there!\u201d\n\u201cYou say that like you didn\u2019t dress up as a dementor just to ruin a quidditch game!\u201d\n\u201cYou say that like you didn\u2019t wait to out yourself as a parselmouth until you were on a literal stage in front of half the school!\u201d\n\u201cOoh,\u201d Harry croons. \u201cYou\u2019re just mad because up \u2018til then everyone thought you were the Heir of Slytherin. Were you terribly jealous when they all decided it was me?\u201d\nJames can\u2019t help himself; he\u2019s been trying so hard not to react aloud to the suggestion that his son broke into Gringotts and broke out of it on a dragon but this final insinuation is the last gobstone. He gasps much too sharply and descends into a violent coughing fit. Harry and Malfoy both startle and look at him as if they\u2019d forgotten about his presence. That theory bears out when, after a beat, they backtrack significantly, and with a far lower level of vitriol.\nHarry clears his throat irritably. \u201cSo you know how to make the potion?\u201d\n\u201dYes, and I know it because I\u2019m just naturally gifted at Potions and I bothered to pay attention in class.\u201d\nHarry looks unconvinced. \u201cSnape\u2019s really not your godfather?\u201d\n\u201cFor your information, my only godfather is my dead Uncle Regulus,\u201d Malfoy says with lofty airs.\nHarry snorts derisively. \u201cDid your parents know he died robbing Voldemort when they named him honorary godfather, or\u2014?\u201d\nThis time it\u2019s Sirius who can't contain his desperate gasp. He also renews the death grip on James\u2019 wrist. James feels this is quite fair, and lets him.\nOnce again, the boys blink in their direction, Harry even winces apologetically, and then they lower their voices further and bring their heads back together. The next time they\u2019re audible, it\u2019s a sharp, vehement denial from Harry.\n\u201cIt\u2019s perfectly safe, I swear,\u201d Malfoy says exasperatedly.\n\u201cI don\u2019t fucking care, nobody\u2019s taking my blood for any sodding potions. Absolutely not.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not Dark Arts, you imbecile, honestly.\u201d\n\u201cDark Arts!\u201d Harry repeats shrilly. \u201cYou want Dark Arts!? Last time anyone took my blood for a potion it produced a terrifying fucking quasi-immortal snake man, so, you\u2019ll forgive me if\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOh, cry me a river.\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\nJames finds his own hand now gripping Sirius\u2019 wrist with equal fervor. He really, really doesn\u2019t need to learn more about the future any time soon. At this rate, neither of them will make it out of this dungeon with ulnas unscathed.\n\u201cClearly the Dark Lord doesn\u2019t need any more resurrection, you buffoon, so obviously your one absolutely implausible concern doesn\u2019t apply here.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not letting anyone take my blood, Malfoy, and that\u2019s final,\u201d Harry growls.\n\u201cWell then you\u2019ll just have to take it yourself.\u201d\n\u201cOh, sure, if I wasn\u2019t bloody well tied up, maybe.\u201d\n\u201cWe can untie you,\u201d James blurts out. He earns a sharp look from Dumbledore for that, but ignores it. If this is really his kid, then sod it all, James feels like he should have some say in the matter. He steps forward. \u201cIf there\u2019s something you need to do to prove, erm, our theory, then we can untie you. Briefly,\" he adds belatedly. \"Under supervision.\"\n\u201cThere you go, Potter,\u201d Malfoy says smugly. \u201cTake your own blood.\u201d\nHarry glowers at the boy. James gets the impression that his own agency in the matter is not exactly the issue at hand, but clearly the opportunity to be freed from his bonds is too tempting to pass up.\n\u201cFine. We\u2019ll take a paternity potion.\u201d\nAh. Well, that\u2019s a much more reassuring option for \u2018potions requiring blood\u2019 than some of the possibilities that had been running through James\u2019 mind. \u201cRight,\u201d he says. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ve still got an in with St. Mungo\u2019s, so I can pop over and borrow one\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d says Malfoy. \u201cEither I brew it myself or I supervise the brewing personally.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that a bit much?\u201d James asks, running a hand through his hair.\n\u201cHonestly, are all Potters blithering idiots at potions?\u201d Malfoy complains with a roll of his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely difficult to differentiate a properly brewed paternity potion from a false-positive paternity potion, so I\u2019ll have to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a false-positive paternity potion.\u201d\n\u201cOh Prongs,\u201d Sirius sighs, wrapping a playful arm around his shoulder. \u201cMagic bless you and your loving, Light-aligned family. So naive, so innocent.\u201d\nJames raises a disgruntled, unamused eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019re saying they exist.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yeah. Bane of the blood supremacist paters, they are. My Grandfather Pollux used to have the house-elves remove all the hemp from all the potions labs on all the Black properties as soon as he heard about a pregnancy in the family.\u201d\n\u201cBlacks,\u201d James mutters. He ignores a condescending snicker from Malfoy.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a reasonable solution, though, all things considered,\u201d Sirius decides. \u201cDumbledore?\u201d\n\u201cIt may be worthwhile, at this stage, to bring in one of the Order\u2019s most talented brewers, yes,\u201d Dumbledore says with a hint of mystery and mischief. He looks expectantly at James while he says that, which is a bit odd because James is definitely not one of the Order\u2019s most talented brewers; really, that distinction rightfully belongs to\u2014\n\u201cOh!\u201d he says. He feels his eyes widen. \u201cOooh! Right. I\u2019ll just. Erm. Bring her over. And we\u2019ll get set up in the lab upstairs?\u201d\nDumbledore nods agreeably. James shoots one expressive look at Sirius, determines he\u2019s at least not any more of a mess than James feels at the moment, and bolts out the door.\nJames vaults over the purple sofa, leaps up three stairs at a time, and blows by Moody, still on watch, with nothing but a, \u201cbe right back!\u201d\nSuddenly he is desperate, aching, for Lily\u2019s presence and he honestly can\u2019t wait another second. The utter incredibility of tonight\u2019s events is threatening to overwhelm him and he just needs to be with her, immediately.\nHe disapparates a single step outside of the wardline and arrives on the threshold of their flat. He unspells and throws the door open to find his girlfriend lounging on the couch with a book, nursing a glass of wine, as if their pub night of less than two hours earlier had never happened. James, already struggling with the concept of linear time, gamely decides to just not think about it.\n\u201cHey Jam,\u201d she says distractedly in greeting.\n\u201cLils,\u201d he breathes. It comes out somewhere between elated and terrified, and gets Lily\u2019s attention immediately.\n\u201cJamie?\u201d\nJames strides over and hugs her tight to his chest, buries his face in her long, soft hair. He\u2019s struggling to find words so he just holds on harder instead.\n\u201cJames?\u201d Lily tries again. \u201cEverything okay with your impromptu mission?\u201d\n\u201cErm. Nobody\u2019s hurt? But we need you to come to the safehouse and brew a potion there.\u201d\n\u201cOh, well, that\u2019s easy enough.\u201d\nJames only nods into the side of her neck because he's not quite ready yet to expound upon the extenuating circumstances.\nLily pats his back. \u201cI\u2019ll need to take a sober-up first, love, so you\u2019re going to have to let me go.\u201d\nThe idea of letting her go has never sounded less appealing. In fact, James is overcome by the urge to ensure he never has to again. Knowing what they become to each other, and also knowing how short their time could be, makes him feel like he has to seize this day, and the future mother of his child, and just hold on.\nIt\u2019s an impulsive decision that will ruin Sirius\u2019 and Remus\u2019 carefully-made plans, but, well, James is no stranger to ruining those anyway. He lets Lily up to rummage through the medicine cabinet and runs to his wardrobe. By the time Lily\u2019s got her boots and cloak on, he\u2019s ready to go as well. They apparate to just outside the wards, leaving, James realizes, a walk of only about 50 meters over dewy dark grass during which to warn Lily about what awaits her.\n\u201cRight, so, just so you know,\u201d he begins, and clears his throat. \u201cYou\u2019ll be brewing a paternity potion for one of two wizards we found at the site of a powerful magical phenomenon. Dumbledore originally brought me in to identify him because he\u2019s very obviously a Potter.\u201d\nLily hums uncertainly. \u201cYou know that paternity potions can only tell you whether any two people are father and child?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I know.\u201d They\u2019ve reached the door to the safe house. James stretches out a hand and stops Lily from going in. The other hand, he runs through his hair. \u201cThe thing is, well, we think he\u2019s my son.\u201d\nAfter a long moment of utter shock, Lily\u2019s face crumples, but morphs quickly into indignation. \u201cA child?\u201d She blusters. \u201dWhose? And, and how? And\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a child,\u201d James blurts out. \u201cHe\u2019s\u2026 We think he\u2019s a time traveler.\u201d\nLily blinks owlishly at him. \u201cAh.\u201d Her face un-crumples and her shoulders drop back down to a normal height, which seems like a good sign. \u201cMaybe we should just go in and see him.\u201d\nJames nods dumbly and follows her in, past an ever-vigilant Moody, to a blue door on the left. Inside the plain but clean potions lab stands Dumbledore along one wall, across from Harry and Malfoy, who are still bound to their chairs. Sirius has both hands planted atop the centre workbench, shoulders thrust forward to loom over a grimly defiant Harry. \n\u201cBlack,\u201d Malfoy is saying. \u201cIf even Potter says it\u2019s gruesome, you should trust him that you don\u2019t want to know.\u201d\nJames clears his throat to announce their arrival and the row ceases abruptly. Sirius glances guiltily at them and steps back to lean against the wall by Dumbledore.\nLily is stopped dead in the doorway, looking at Harry. James can\u2019t see her face but he can peer over her shoulder and Harry is staring at her like she\u2019s the last thing he\u2019ll see before he dies. His jaws are clenched fiercely together but his eyes are still tearing up and he just looks terribly, hopelessly overcome.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Lily says softly. \u201cHe does look quite a lot like you, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\u201cExcept he has your eyes,\u201d James adds in the same tone of voice: reverent.\nLily hums. \u201cHe does.\u201d She walks over to crouch before Harry. \u201cI\u2019m Lily. But you probably already knew that.\u201d\n\u201cDraco Malfoy,\u201d Malfoy drawls. \u201cHow I\u2019d love to shake your hand, if you\u2019d just untie me\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYeah, nice try,\" Sirius snorts. \nLily raises an eyebrow. \u201cPleasure.\u201d\n\u201cThis is Harry,\u201d James offers, because it feels a bit wrong to make the boy introduce himself to his own mother.\n\u201cHi Harry,\u201d Lily says. She lays a careful hand on Harry\u2019s shoulder and his eyelids flutter shut, though not before a few tears leak out. \nJames looks at them in that moment and feels indescribably full, like this is all he\u2019s ever needed in his life: Lily and their son, and their love. Ropes notwithstanding. James is immensely grateful to have weathered the whole instant-suspicion-and-hate phase earlier tonight, to have given these two a chance to greet each other as they deserve.\nHarry opens his eyes. \u201cHi mum,\u201d he whispers. \n\u201cOh dear,\u201d Lily sighs. \u201cThat\u2019s not how you look at a mum you\u2019ve seen recently, is it?\u201d\nThere\u2019s one tremulous moment in which Harry only stares at her, and then he jerks his head down. It might be enough to hide the tears but it can\u2019t disguise the shaking of his shoulders.\nLily leans in and tucks Harry\u2019s head against her clavicle, cards her fingers gently through that Potter hair. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she says. James is dazzled by her ability to empathize, to feel love and loss on behalf of this boy she\u2019s just met; to comfort him when he clearly needs her, regardless of the fact that motherhood is not yet a milestone she has personally crossed. \nShe turns her head towards James, who\u2019s now leaning against the wall next to Padfoot, to support his gooey knees. \u201cIs it really necessary to keep him tied up like this?\u201d Lily asks.\nJames scratches awkwardly at his neck. \u201cTechnically, we haven\u2019t completely confirmed he is who he says he is. Nor, for that matter, that we are who we say we are.\u201d\nHarry sucks in a shuddery breath. \u201cIf this is a Death Eater trap I\u2019ll destroy every last one of you.\u201d\nSirius barks out a laugh that breaks the tension in the room. \nLily sighs and stands back up. \u201cPaternity potion, then?\u201d\n\u201cPaternity potion,\u201d James confirms.\nLily nods and starts selecting ingredients and laying them out on the worktable. She lights the fire, primes and fills the cauldron, and pulls out a knife.\nMalfoy coughs significantly. \u201cI can\u2019t quite see the worktable from this angle,\u201d he says. He sounds like he\u2019s trying hard and just barely failing to cut down on that trademark Malfoy superciliousness.\nJames finds it rather amusing, to be honest. He transfigures the legs of Malfoy\u2019s chair longer until he can see everything easily. \n\u201cThank you,\u201d Malfoy says imperiously. Then he side-eyes Harry, whose seat is now several inches lower than his, with a triumphant smirk. James rolls his eyes and transfigures Harry\u2019s chair to the same height. \n\u201cI didn\u2019t realize this was an exhibition,\u201d Lily comments drily. \n\u201cI\u2019m just the impartial assessor who will ensure it\u2019s not a false-positive,\u201d says Malfoy.\n\u201cAh. In case this is a Death Eater trap.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed.\u201d\n\u201cWell, colour me pretty well concerned that a bunch of teenagers of my own child\u2019s generation are still worried about Death Eaters in\u2014 what year are you from, supposedly?\u201d\nMalfoy raises a challenging eyebrow at Harry. Harry glares back at him. James wonders if now is a bad time to ask Lily what random vidyo means.\n\u201c1998,\u201d Malfoy answers.\nLily whistles. \u201cThat\u2019s a long time for a community as small as ours to be at war.\u201d\n\u201cThere was a period of peace there in between,\" Malfoy says, and shifts uncomfortably in his seat.\nLily nods casually, though her knuckles whiten on the grip of her knife. \u201cDidn\u2019t last though?\u201d\nWhen no one else seems inclined to elaborate, James coughs. \u201cThere was some talk of a resurrection.\u201d\nLily nods again with a grimace and drops the subject. She swaps out her knife and starts smushing puffapod beans with the side of the new blade.\n\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to cut those up,\u201d Malfoy says sharply.\n\u201cThe pickled puffapod beans? Yes, I believe that\u2019s what the standard recipe says, but you\u2019ll release the juice much better by crushing them with the flat side of a silver dagger.\u201d\nHarry, who has seemed benignly uninterested in the rest of the potion-making process so far, suddenly gasps. It echoes loudly in the quiet of the lab, such that all eyes end up on him. \u201cWhere did you learn that?\u201d\n\u201cAn old friend of mine realized, I think. We used to experiment with potions quite a bit when we were younger, before\u2026\u201d she trails off awkwardly.\nSnivellus, James thinks bitterly. He is nonetheless surprised to hear his son reach the same conclusion.\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me it was Snape?\u201d Harry asks, sounding absolutely gobsmacked.\nLily glances up at him warily. \u201cIt was.\"\nHarry looks like his entire world is crashing down around him; it\u2019s honestly hilarious. James can practically feel Sirius\u2019 amusement wafting off him in waves. \n\u201cYou were friends with Snape? But\u2014 but why?\u201d\nThey\u2019re interrupted by a ringing peal of laughter from Sirius. \u201cNo need for paternity potions,\u201d he guffaws. \u201cThat\u2019s definitely your son, Prongs.\u201d\n\u201cWe grew up in the same neighborhood,\u201d Lily explains with a sigh, looking more at her cutting board than at Harry. \u201cHe\u2019s the one who taught me about magic. He was my best friend.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Harry croaks. \u201cNo. No way. No. He\u2019s a bitter old bullying git and a traitor and he called you a mudblood and HE KILLED DUMBLEDORE!\u201d Harry ends on a roar.\nLily inhales sharply at that, eyes flashing. She looks almost desperate for Malfoy to contradict it, but he\u2019s only barely stayed upright in his chair given how hard he just flinched; all he can manage at the moment is a sad shrug.\n\u201cOh, Sev,\u201d she says mournfully.\n\u2018Sev,\u2019 Harry mouths incredulously. He looks like he\u2019s going to be sick. \nDefinitely my son, James thinks.\n\u201cWe grew apart,\u201d Lily offers in penance. \u201cHe got pulled into the Dark Arts and the Death Eaters. It\u2026 wasn\u2019t unexpected, I guess, though I was devastated all the same.\u201d\nJames watches Harry struggle and fail to acclimate to the concept that his mum was friends with Snape, and swallows down a surge of belated understanding for Lily that he never quite managed at sixteen. Harry hasn\u2019t explained to them how or when Peter turned, after all. Has he, too, already been pulled into the Death Eaters?\n\u201cSo,\u201d Lily says lightly after several awkward minutes of quiet. \u201cHow did you two end up here, anyway?\u201d\nMalfoy looks at Harry. Harry looks at Malfoy. Both of them shrug. \u201cThere\u2019s all sorts of strange artefacts in the Room of Hidden Things,\u201d Malfoy says eventually. \u201cWe probably knocked into something during the fight.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t exactly remember much,\u201d Harry adds, still quite sullen over the Snape revelation.\nLily sprinkles in the last of the dandelion roots, stirs three times each direction, and sets a timer. \u201cOkay, this will simmer for nine minutes.\u201d She sits back down on a stool behind her. \u201cWill you tell me about yourself in the meantime?\u201d\nHarry looks warily at her for a moment, but acquiesces. He starts talking, haltingly, clearly steering around some topics, though James can\u2019t quite identify what they are. Nevertheless, James learns that his son is a Gryffindor (he already knew that, but he\u2019s thrilled to hear it again), he likes treacle tart (classic Mama Evans), he has two best friends (NOT Malfoy, who looks supremely and hilariously offended at Lily\u2019s innocent misunderstanding, given they did arrive here together), he\u2019s a quidditch prodigy (Malfoy looks supremely and hilariously offended at that assertion as well, but, even more hilariously, he can\u2019t deny it), he\u2019s good at Defense Against the Dark Arts (practical! James, as a responsible father-to-be, approves), and he had a snowy owl named Hedwig until about ten months ago (definitely a bit of a bummer; James is relieved when Lily\u2019s timer interrupts that explanation).\nFinally, the potion is ready, and James cuts his finger to let three drops of blood into the cauldron. He then walks over to hand Harry the knife, casually placing himself between Harry and Lily, just in case, and spells off his bindings. \nHarry sighs with the release of the ropes and stands stiffly. He looks at the knife with grim anxiety etched all over his face, turns his palm up as if ready to cut, hesitates, and looks back at Malfoy for some kind of reassurance.\n\u201cThree drops,\u201d Malfoy says evenly.\nHarry nods, holds his hand over the cauldron, grits his teeth, and cuts himself. The blood drips into the potion and turns it a blinding white. Harry steps back a bit, blinking his eyes.\n\u201cCongratulations,\u201d Lily says softly. \u201cIt\u2019s a boy.\u201d\nHarry raises his eyebrows at Malfoy, who nods. \u201cThat\u2019s a positive.\u201d\nSomething loosens in James\u2019 shoulders. That\u2019s really his son, he thinks. Harry, his son. Funny how it felt so real before and now, having received incontrovertible confirmation, it somehow feels surreal.\nIt only takes a second for Lily to carefully remove the knife from Harry\u2019s grasp, set it down safely on the worktop, and sweep him into a hug. Harry grasps the fabric of her shirt and holds on to her for dear life. Sirius claps James on the shoulder and pushes him forward; he wraps his arms around Lily, sandwiching Harry between them.\nThey stay like that for what feels like hours, though it\u2019s probably only a couple minutes, max, until they\u2019re interrupted by an awkward but insistent throat clearing behind James.\n\u201cAm I just to remain tied up forever, then?\u201d Malfoy drawls.\n\u201cHarry,\u201d Dumbledore calls. \u201cYou are willing to vouch for Mr. Malfoy\u2019s loyalties?\u201d\nHarry finally pulls himself away from his parents, looks at Malfoy, then at Dumbledore, and nods. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s a shit Death Eater. I reckon he\u2019s been trying to defect for ages.\u201d\nMalfoy sniffs but he\u2019s clearly too intelligent to refute the point, degrading though its presentation may be. \u201cI\u2019ll have you know I was forced into it to begin with,\u201d he clarifies. \u201cAfter you got my father arrested,\u201d he adds with some heat.\nHarry glares back at him. \u201cAfter he got Sirius killed? I\u2019m not sorry.\u201d\nA long, low groan announces Sirius\u2019 reaction to that news. \u201cKilled by fucking Lucy?\u201d he whinges. \u201cFucking rough.\u201d\n\u201cErm,\u201d says Harry, scratching at his neck. \u201cTechnically he only lured us to the battle? It was really Bellatrix who got the final blow. And the, erm, Veil of Death?\u201d\n\u201cIn the Department of Mysteries?\u201d Dumbledore asks with intensity.\n\u201cNow there\u2019s a cluedo solution for the ages,\u201d Lily quips.\nSirius groans again.\nHarry\u2019s shoulders tense. \u201cYeah. There was a battle there.\u201d\n\u201cAhem,\u201d Malfoy repeats. \u201cRopes?\u201d\n\u201cRight-o, cuz,\u201d Sirius says. He waves his wand and Malfoy\u2019s restraints disappear.\nMalfoy immediately springs up to rub at his wrists and ankles and chest, trying in vain to smooth out the wrinkles in his robes. \u201cYou didn\u2019t happen to find a wand or two with us, did you?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid not, dear boy,\u201d Dumbledore says sadly.\nMalfoy sighs. \u201cFucking typical.\u201d He continues to grumble under his breath about something that sounds a whole lot like \u201cScarhead\u201d and \u201cPotter.\u201d\n\u201cHarry,\u201d says Dumbledore, like a crup with a bone, \u201cwhat was the purpose of the battle in the Department of Mysteries?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a long story.\"\n\u201cI think we\u2019d like to hear it,\u201d Lily says. \u201cAll of it. Let me just clean up the lab here and then why don\u2019t we sit down and go over everything?\u201d She vanishes the muck on the workstation, rubs the cutting board down, and then turns around to scrub the knives and cauldron out in the sink against the far wall. While she\u2019s thusly occupied, James steps over behind her and kneels down.\n\u201cNo way,\u201d Malfoy breathes.\n\u201cThis is definitely not how it was supposed to happen,\u201d Harry whispers anxiously.\n\u201cOh, come on,\u201d Sirius groans. \u201cWe had a plan, Prongs! A good plan!\u201d\nJames only looks over his shoulder to give him a sheepish but unrepentant grin.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Lily says absently, rinsing the cauldron out. When nobody replies, she finally looks over.\nAnd turns around completely to find James on one knee, ring in hand.\n\u201cOh.\u201d Her quiet breath of surprise is almost, but not quite, covered up by the clang of the forgotten cauldron falling into the sink.\n\u201cLily Marie Evans,\u201d James starts, embarrassed to hear his voice is already creaky with emotion. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the future tonight, our future, and he is strong and clever and loyal and wonderful, just like you.\u201d He tears his eyes from Lily\u2019s face, with effort, to smile softly at Harry. He\u2019s wiping at his eyes with the sleeve of his jacket, and James turns back around to find Lily doing the same thing. This small, beautiful congruency fills James\u2019 chest even closer to bursting.\n\u201cHarry\u2019s story was\u2026 darker and more awful than I could ever have imagined, but\u2026 no matter how dark this war gets, Lily, you will always be the light of my life. And no matter how long or short our lives end up being, and no matter how awful the end, I want you to know it\u2019s all worth it, to fight and even die by your side. Because I found out tonight that I really will die for you, and it only made me more determined to live for you, too, to make sure you know every single day how much I love you. I\u2019ve been waiting to marry you for years, Evans, and I might not have that many years left to wait, and I just refuse to wait any longer.\u201d\nHe pauses for a steadying breath before the big question, but never gets around to answering it. \u201cOf course I will, you daft sod,\u201d Lily answers. James\u2019 beaming smile is unaffected by her irreverent epithet.\n\u201cJust call him an arrogant toerag, why don\u2019t you,\u201d Sirius jeers.\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough from the peanut gallery,\u201d Lily shoots back. She cups both hands around James\u2019 face. \u201cJames Fleamont Potter, you have been shockingly wise tonight for how much of a toerag you truly were at fifteen.\u201d She crooks a half-smile at Sirius\u2019 triumphant hoots but otherwise ignores him. \u201cI consider myself lucky to know the brave, steadfast, loving man you\u2019ve matured into. And I\u2019ll consider myself even luckier to be your wife.\u201d \nShe leans down to kiss him and James surges up to meet her, to spin her around in his arms, warm, triumphant, ecstatic.\n\u201cBollocks,\u201d Harry mutters. \u201cIt\u2019s official. I've meddled with time. Hermione\u2019s gonna be so mad.\u201d\n\u201cWe already know you ruin everything, Potter,\u201d Malfoy snarks, but his watery voice betrays his emotion.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe I got to witness my parents\u2019 engagement live but had to share it with Malfoy. Of all the absurd things I\u2019ve been through\u2026\u201d\nJames finally pulls back to let out a snort. Trust his own sprog to ruin the moment. \nHe pulls Lily\u2019s hand away from his face and carefully, reverently, slides the ring onto it. It\u2019s an old Potter heirloom, all topaz and rubies, but still elegant. It suits her, he thinks.\nLily kisses him again, then they finally turns to face their motley group of spectators: his teenage son (weird, but good), his best mate (annoying, but good), his headmaster (weird, but fine), and a Malfoy (annoying, but, he guesses, fine). Well, James tells himself, this is what he gets for ignoring Remus and Sirius\u2019 carefully laid plans.\n\u201cMoony\u2019s gonna be so mad he missed this,\u201d Sirius remarks, as though following James\u2019 train of thought. \u201cWe were all there together at pub night just hours ago and yet you waited for whatever this is, instead, where he\u2019s not.\u201d\nJames sighs. \u201cI\u2019ll just have to propose again with the original plan, then, won\u2019t I?\u201d\n\u201cKnowing you lot, this is actually the more sensible proposal,\u201d Lily remarks drily, \u201cso maybe I should be glad it happened first.\u201d\n\u201cYou wound me!\u201d Sirius cries dramatically. \u201cOi, Harry, you\u2019ll help us with the re-do, won\u2019t you? We\u2019ll need someone to fill in for Wormtail anyway.\u201d\nHarry flashes him a blinding smile that makes something in James\u2019 chest ache. \u201cYeah, alright.\u201d\n\u201cBrilliant,\u201d Sirius says. \u201cWe need to go out and celebrate!\u201d\nJames instantly agrees; Lily, responsibly, looks to Dumbledore for a dismissal.\n\u201cCongratulations to you both on your engagement,\u201d Dumbledore rumbles, shaking their hands. \u201cAnd far be it from me to keep you from a much deserved celebration. I daresay we can leave off further well-meaning interrogation of our new allies for later this week. However,\u201d he says to Harry and Malfoy, \u201cI\u2019ll need to see to your temporary living arrangements before you go.\u201d\n\u201cHarry\u2019s coming back with us,\u201d James says at once. \u201cHe\u2019s our son and we\u2019ve got a comfy couch and I\u2019m good at transfiguration. Problem solved.\u201d\nHarry looks utterly thrilled by the offer for all of fifteen seconds before Padfoot ruins it.\n\u201cNot tonight!\u201d Sirius interjects with a lascivious cackle. \u201cNot when you two\u2019ll be shagging all night as soon as you get home.\u201d\nHarry turns promptly green in the face. Malfoy sniggers too.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll both come home with me,\u201d Sirius insists. He walks over and manouvers himself between the two teens, clapping a long arm over each of their shoulders. Harry looks significantly more comfortable with this arrangement than Malfoy does. \n\u201cMoony and I have a whole empty guest room and it\u2019s got an entire real bed I can duplicate for the night. And then when Prongs and Lily have gotten all the crazy engagement sex out of their system, Haz, you can go live with them, and you, cuz, will stay with me and Moony and we\u2019ll get drunk and bond over the trauma of the House of Black and plot to steal Reg back from the wankers, yeah?\u201d\n\u201cErm,\u201d says Malfoy.\n\u201cSounds perfect!\u201d Harry chirps, beaming all the harder at Malfoy for pure spite.\nMalfoy looks imploringly at Harry. \u201cWho\u2019s Moony?\u201d he whispers.\n\u201cProfessor Lupin,\u201d Harry whispers back.\n\u201cProfessor Lupin!\u201d Sirius crows. \u201cOh, he\u2019ll love that. Might even make up for the whole missing the Prongs-posal thing. A professor!\u201d He starts shuffling them out the door, repeating \u201cProfessor Lupin!\u201d with glee at regular intervals.\nJames wants to linger behind for a quiet moment with his fiancee, but Lily intertwines her pale fingers with his and pulls him towards the door instead. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go make sure Sirius isn\u2019t corrupting our son,\u201d she says. \nAnd just like that, they're a family of three."
