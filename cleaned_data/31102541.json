    "text": "\nThere is a tragedy in being selfless.\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku Midoriya had it down to an art.\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku had followed Katsuki his entire life. He often mused if there was a specific moment in which he fell in love with the blonde, but he was unable to find it. There were hundreds of memories when they were young that sprang to mind at the thought. He thought that perhaps his affections would disappear in their middle-school years, when all he heard from Bakugu was hatred and bitterness, but they did not. As they both became heroes and grew, they eventually became friends again. Forgiveness was given and earned, and slowly, Izuku found those crimson eyes lingering, Katsuki seeking him out to train, hands brushing while studying together.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd then the confession.\u00a0\n\n\nHe blamed himself, in the end, for not noticing sooner. For ignoring the tickle in his throat, the blood that sometimes leaked out between his teeth. He was too blinded by joy, by overwhelming relief that finally, finally, someone loved him.\u00a0\n\n\nThat was his first mistake.\u00a0\n\n\nHis tragedy began there, by believing that he could ever be enough for Katsuki Bakugou. He deluded himself into trusting that it was his hand that Kachaan wanted to hold, his eyes that Kachaan wanted to stare into, and his laugh that Kachaan wished to inspire. He convinced himself that the years of growth they shared would be enough to make him stay.\u00a0\n\n\nHe should have known that he would never satisfy Katsuki.\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku was never good enough. Why would that change now?\u00a0\n\n\nIt was his naivety that shielded him from realizing the truth. He was merely a placeholder for someone else. Someone with red hair, not green. Someone with sharp teeth and a big smile, someone with spiky locks and a boisterous voice.\u00a0\n\n\nSomeone who was, in every way, better than Izuku.\u00a0\n\n\nHowever, he was not an idiot, and soon enough, he noticed it too. When Mina broke up with Kiri, Katsuki was the first one at his side. He stayed in the redhead\u2019s room for hours, consoling him and giving him a shoulder to cry on. He canceled training with Izuku to get Kirishima back on his feet. He pushed back their dates to cook dinner for him. He disregarded Izuku\u2019s texts to spend time with him.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd Izuku, \n\ntragically\n\n, understood.\u00a0\n\n\nAs the first petal tumbled from his busted lips after returning from patrol one March evening in their third year, he understood \n\nperfectly\n\n.\u00a0\n\n\nAt first, he had wanted to be angry. He wanted to scream and wail and bring the building crashing down on the pair. But he could not. Katsuki had been a wonderful boyfriend. He had cared about Izuku even if he had never really loved him, and that was more than Izuku could have ever hoped for. He had held his hand and pushed back his curls to kiss his freckles. He had laughed with Izuku and made Izuku laugh, crimson eyes lighting up whenever the sound occurred. He cooked him katsudon whenever he asked, he brought him flowers, he listened to Izuku talk about heroes for hours.\u00a0\n\n\nHe had been perfect.\u00a0\n\n\nSo perfect that it made sense why Izuku was inadequate.\u00a0\n\n\nSeven months. Izuku had gotten seven months with Kachaan. As he sat in his room, looking at the picture of his boyfriend that had been chosen for his phone\u2019s lock screen, he cried. As he did, he felt something in him break. Years of torment, neglect, and abuse finally caught up with him, and he shattered on his dorm floor.\u00a0\n\n\nThe next morning, he got up, flashed a smile to his classmates, boyfriend, teacher, and kept going.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nIzuku deserved better. It was something that Katsuki had known for a while now. He deserved someone who loved him unabashedly. He deserved someone who would never look at anyone else while they were with him.\n\n\n\u201cDeku,\u201d He paused. Izuku deserved more than that, than this. He deserved the world. The least Katsuki could do after everything was call him by his name. \u201cIzuku.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nHis boyfriend lifted his head from the blonde\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHmm?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026\u201d\n\n\nHe took a deep, shaking breath, and prepared for the worst.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in love with Kirishima.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku did not react like he thought he would. There were no screams or All for One fuelled punches to the face. Instead, a scarred hand enclosed around his own and squeezed. Katsuki\u2019s wide eyes darted up to his. Green irises shone with horribly kind understanding.\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku\u2019s lips curled into a very sad smile. \u201cI know, Kachaan.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nKatsuki\u2019s stomach dropped. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou always tell me how \u2018annoyingly smart\u2019 I am, Kachaan,\u201d the boy replied with a chuckle. \u201cYou really think I wouldn\u2019t notice?\u201d\n\n\nThe explosive teenager blinked in shock.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just honored you would let me love you for a little while,\u201d Izuku grinned, and for a moment Katsuki saw the five-year-old from all those years ago. Izuku had been in love with him since they were kids, and now Katsuki was going to break his heart all over again. \u201cNow go on.\u201d\n\n\nKatsuki\u2019s hands were shaking in Izuku\u2019s. He gripped them tighter. Jerking his head towards their friends, he added, \u201cThey\u2019ll understand.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cIzu-,\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say anything, Kachaan. These past few months have been the best of my life,\u201d he whispered, and Katsuki tried to ignore how his chest tightened at the tears in his green eyes. \u201cAnd I love you. I love you, Kat, which means I have to let you go. Now run along. Eiji is probably waiting for you.\u201d\n\n\nKatsuki took Izuku\u2019s hands and kissed his knuckles.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThank you, Izu.\u201d\n\n\nThe smile he received was heartbreakingly beautiful. \u201cGoodbye, Katsuki.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nIf he\u2019d thought a little harder past the giddy relief, Katsuki would have found it off that Izuku had used his first name with that mourning tone. He did not wait to think of such things, however, and he released Izuku\u2019s hands and took off towards his love. He did not notice the flower that was torn from Izuku\u2019s throat as his newly ex-boyfriend disappeared around the corner.\u00a0\n\n\nNo one did.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThey started an agency together. They called it 1-A, and Aizawa denied his misty eyes as Bakugou and Midoriya cut the red ribbon that stretched across the doors. It was almost unheard of for two new heroes, only two years out of graduating from Yuuei, to start their own company, but they had done it. Jirou, Iida, Kaminari, Shinso, and of course, Kirishima, joined them in their endeavor. Their team quickly moved up the hero ranks, and the dreams that each of them had fostered since childhood finally began to be realized.\n\n\nBetween the grins and the heroic battles, Izuku felt the plant within his chest continue to grow. Bakugou and Kirishima became one of the public\u2019s favorite couples, and their faces graced the covers of multiple papers and magazines a month. Whispers of engagements and weddings began to surface, and Izuku tried to ignore them.\u00a0\n\n\nThe first full flower ruptured from his bloody throat the day they defeated Shigaraki.\u00a0\n\n\nIt was a normal Tuesday. The clouds were overcast, ready to explode with torrents at any moment. The League of Villains was making their final attempt to bring chaos into Japan. All For One thrived within Shigaraki, and he met Izuku on the battlefield with blank eyes and roaring voice. Izuku, according to press the next day, was unnaturally quiet during the ordeal. He dominated the war like Achilles, unstoppable and courageous. With nine quirks at his fingertips, he flew through the air like a bullet, landed like a meteor, and landed blows like his predecessor.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYOU WILL FAIL!\u201d Shigaraki screamed with his distorted voice.\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku, bloody, shattered bones, did not smile. Instead, he wiped his broken nose and answered back, calm, collected, and utterly sure.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou better believe I will,\u201d he croaked. \u201cBut I\u2019m taking your crusty ass with me.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nHe had never used United States of Smash before, but the world would remember this debut. Lightning crackles across the entire sky. Green electricity arced down from the dark clouds and into his body. From the sidelines, his comrades all gaped at the power that rippled across his broad shoulders.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Kaminari whispered.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cNo kidding,\u201d Jirou snorted.\u00a0\n\n\nKatsuki smirked proudly.\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku heard the voices of the past resound in his mind. He raised his eyes, vibrant green and charged with more energy than he had ever felt before.\u00a0\n\n\nShigaraki never stood a chance.\u00a0\n\n\nOnly after it was over did his friends dare to approach. Slowly, climbing over building debris and rubble, they neared the shaking form of the hero Deku. Green lightning buzzed around his body. His breathing trembled and he did not even appear to hear them approach.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cDeku,\u201d Kachaan began hoarsely.\u00a0\n\n\nTerrifying green eyes darted to meet his. The blonde froze.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just me, nerd. It\u2019s your Kachaan.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku felt the vestiges of One for All dim, settle, fall back to their dormant state within him. The energy fled from him like ants from fire and he dropped. Katsuki caught him, strong arms holding him up before he faceplanted. Blood poured from his mouth, his nose, his side.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cShh, shh, I\u2019ve got you,\u201d Katsuki lowered him to the ground, worried brows furrowed.\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku curled into his embrace. \u201cDid\u2026 is it done?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nHis best friend ran a bloody hand through green locks. \u201cYeah, nerd. You did it.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWe did it,\u201d the freckled man amended. He raised a fist. Kachaan tapped it with his own.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYeah, Izu. We did it.\u201d Bakugou curled protectively around him, pulling him further into his arms to try and stop the bleeding.\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku\u2019s chest clenched and his throat seized. He began coughing for a completely different reason than his wounds. Blood drenched his chin anew, mixing with the rain as it hit his skin. He felt the petals beginning to make their way up to his esophagus and he gasped, trying to push Katsuki away from him.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cNerd, Deku! Stop it!\u201d Katsuki continued running a hand through his hair and only gripped him tighter. \u201cStop! You\u2019re hurt!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nHis other friends began to crowd as his vision blurred. Breath stuttered in his cramped lungs and he took one last straggling gasp before his vision darkened. He felt a petal on his tongue; he only prayed that none of them noticed.\u00a0\n\n\nHe woke in the hospital. It was quiet. Soreness riddled his body, but he was alive.\u00a0\n\n\nA quiet snore sounded beside him. He glanced to the left and was greeted with the most beautiful sight he had ever witnessed.\u00a0\n\n\nKatsuki was collapsed against his bed, head pillowed atop his crossed arms, sound asleep.\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku smiled fondly, reaching up to run his fingers throw those blonde spikes. His throat tickled, and he should have stopped. However, Izuku never knew when pain was too much, and he had no idea if he would ever get this moment again.\u00a0\n\n\nHe looked so beautiful like that. The evening light turned him golden. Izuku wondered if this was how Kirishima saw him every morning. Was he this calm? This sweet? Did he open his crimson eyes and gaze at Eijirou like he was the most perfect thing he had ever seen?\n\n\nHis chest ached suddenly and he bent over. Horrible hacking filled the quiet room and he felt his airway close.\u00a0\n\n\nThe familiar texture of flower petals filled his mouth, but this one was so much \n\nbigger\n\n.\u00a0\n\n\nHe retracted his hand from Katsuki\u2019s hair and coughed into his elbow. The sound alerted his companion, who began to wake. Violently shaking, he felt the petal fall from his mouth, sticky and covered in red. Only, it was not a petal.\u00a0\n\n\nIt was an entire damn flower.\u00a0\n\n\nFuck.\u00a0\n\n\nHe scrambled, shoving the flower behind his pillow before Katsuki could notice.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cIzuku!\u201d Bakugou surged forward, pulling him into a tight hug.\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku allowed the embrace to happen, and tried to convince himself that his sobs were of relief.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nAuntie\u2019s funeral was quiet. It was a tragically small affair, for how wonderful the woman was. Her kindness touched so many, and yet her funeral begged no more than twenty visitors. The distant Midoriya relatives did not even show. Mostly Izuku\u2019s friends and classmates came to show support, but Katsuki wanted to kick half of them out.\u00a0\n\n\nNone of them understood. None of them knew the support that Aunti Inko had provided, the unwavering faith she had in her son when no one else did.\u00a0\n\n\nNone of them knew the true horrors that Izuku had experienced when he was younger. None of them understood that when Katsuki stopped being Izuku\u2019s hero and turned to childish villainy, Inko was always the one who made him smile again.\u00a0\n\n\nNo one else knew how old Izuku had to become so quickly either. None of these extras understood that he had to become the man of the house by six, how his deadbeat father never showed his face again, how Izuku learned to cover his bruises with concealer, how he learned to patch up his own wounds like a battlefield medic, how he taught himself to smile like All Might because he had forgotten how to smile by himself. No one else understood the weight of this death, this loss, this grief of innocence.\u00a0\n\n\nThe last shred of childhood goodness, lowered into the ground and buried.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd so Katsuki growled at anyone who tried to offer meaningless condolences. He even snarled at Eijirou, who had tried to tell Izuku that she was in a better place. Fury had coursed through Bakugou like a raging volcano and he squared his shoulders, glaring so vehemently at his boyfriend that the redhead had stepped away, hands up in surrender.\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku finally turned then and shook his head. \u201cNo, Kiri, you\u2019re fine. Thank you.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nKatsuki growled again and put an arm around Izuku\u2019s shoulders. He did not mention the trembling beneath his palm as they both turned back to the stone. He heard Eijirou turn to leave and did not look back. He would apologize later, when Izuku did not need him.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to stay, Kachaan.\u201d he muttered, hands wringing. Katsuki\u2019s gaze fell to his fingers. They were so scarred and misshaped; years of physical malfunction had turned his hands into monuments of pain. He knew they still ached constantly, and yet he never complained.\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku did not complain about anything. Katsuki often wondered how much he withheld in that big brain of his. How much trauma he never talked about, the pain he never acknowledged.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAnd leave you here alone?\u201d He scoffed. \u201cAuntie would haunt my ass.\u201d\n\n\nThe taller man hummed, but it was not happy. \u201cKiri should feel threatened.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nKatsuki forced a laugh at his poor attempt at humor. \u201cShut up, nerd.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku hummed again. \u201cShe always thought that we would end up together. Childhood friends and all that.\u201d\n\n\nHe reached forward and placed a trembling hand on her headstone. Shaking fingers traced her engraved name with love. \u201cShe was a hopeless romantic that way.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nBakugou leaned into Izuku, giving the silent support that he needed. It was nice to be needed, as awful as the situation was. Though they owned an agency together, though they patrolled together, though they saved lives together, ever since graduation, Izuku had been distant. He always felt too far for Katsuki to reach. He was never close enough for him to help, to protect, to love. A sadness had grown in his best friend\u2019s eyes since the end of their third year that Katsuki could not fix.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cBut\u2026 I think she also knew that we would never last.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nKatsuki raised his head at Izuku\u2019s mournful tone. \u201cWhy?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nGreen eyes lifted from cold stone, but they were no warmer. \u201cYou\u2019re like the sun, Kachaan. I never shone bright enough to match you, and I think she noticed. I was content to live in that shadow, but you didn\u2019t want that.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nKatsuki felt confusion well in him. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku shrugged, eyes lifeless. Katsuki had never seen him so emotionless before. It was horribly disconcerting. \u201cYou wanted someone who would challenge you, who would put you back on your feet, who would be enough to\u2026 who would be enough.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThe blonde pulled away, anger beginning to replace his befuddlement. \u201cYou told me it was okay.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku\u2019s eyes, which had returned to his mother\u2019s grave, did not move as he asked, \u201cPardon?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou told me that you had known and you were okay with it!\u201d He removed himself from any physical contact, taking his support with him. Tears burned the edges of his eyes. \u201cWhat the hell does that have to do with anything now? It\u2019s been six years since we broke up, \n\nDeku\n\n.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThe minute the nickname came out of his mouth, he regretted it. Not the name itself, because its meaning had changed so much, but the way he said it. It was all anger and spite and borderline hate. It was a tone that neither had heard in years.\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku flinched, and Katsuki\u2019s heart dropped. \u201cIzu-,\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Kachaan,\u201d was his gentle interruption. He was always too gentle. Katsuki wanted him to be angry. He wanted him to let out the emotions that he was so used to seeing. \u201cYou can go. I\u2019m sure Kiri is waiting for you.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThe words were so similar to that day six years ago. Why did they hurt so much? \u201cWhy are you pushing me away? You\u2019re my best friend, Izu.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThe green-haired man turned. The deadness in his gaze was something Katsuki had never seen before. It was so unnerving that the blonde took a step back, away from the foreign Deku in front of him. Away from the emotionless corpse his friend had become.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou really have no idea, do you?\u201d\n\n\nKatsuki stared, eyes wide and mouth gaping.\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku huffed and nodded. He turned back to the tombstone, to the burning incense, and muttered, \u201cHave a nice evening, Kachaan. Thanks for coming.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nKatsuki burned with anger and confusion, and he let it drag him furiously away from his friend. He slammed the door to the car and turned the keys, ignoring Kirishima\u2019s concerned questions. He did not look in his mirror as he pulled away, and he did not think of Izuku.\u00a0\n\n\nHe did not stay to see Izuku crumble against his mother\u2019s grave, sobbing broken apologies and purple flowers into the dead grass.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nHitoshi was the one that found him up there.\u00a0\n\n\nThe roof had always been a place of solace for Izuku. As the end continued to near, he found himself up there more and more often.\u00a0\n\n\nThe purple-haired hero slid his legs through the railing as he sat down, shoulder bumping against Izuku\u2019s with a comforting warmth. Neither said anything. Instead, Shinso pulled a purple petal from his pocket and handed it to Izuku. The taller boy did not ask how Shinso had figured out it was his, or where he found it. He simply took it silently and sniffed.\u00a0\n\n\nHe tossed it over the roof\u2019s edge and contemplated throwing himself after it.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHow long?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cSince third year.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAre you going to get the surgery?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cNope.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nShinso\u2019s jaw clenched. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t deserve you.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku hummed. \u201cIt\u2019s not his fault I\u2019m unloveable.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThe other hero did not reply, but Izuku could see the anger in his eyes.\u00a0\n\n\nHe shifted, laying his head on Hitoshi\u2019s shoulder, and wished that he was not made of broken dreams.\u00a0\n\n\nThey stayed up there until morning.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSince when do you have a dog?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nKatsuki stood in Deku\u2019s doorway, bag of decorations hanging off his arm. A large golden retriever panted happily in front of him, tail wagging.\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku poked his head around the corner to the kitchen and a small smile worked its way across his lips at the canine. \u201cSince yesterday.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201c\n\nWhy\n\n do you have a dog?\u201d He walked down the hall and laid his bag on the counter, leaning against it and petting the animal as he watched Izuku busy himself around the kitchen.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cFound it in a collapsed building yesterday and brought it home,\u201d He explained.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou really think that you have time for a pet?\u201d Katsuki snorted, fingers scratching behind the dog\u2019s ears. The animal happily shifted closer to him, content just with the simple attention.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHis name is Yagi, and I can make time,\u201d His friend replied as he grabbed Katsuki a glass of milk. \u201cBesides, the boy needed a home and I\u2019m lonely. Seemed like a perfect solution.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re lonely?\u201d Katsuki\u2019s heart clenched at the thought of Izuku sitting by himself in this apartment. It made sense, he supposed. Izuku had never dated since high school. He always claimed he did not have the time for it and he never wanted to drag someone into his dangerous life. Now that he thought about it, Izuku did not invite anyone over either. This was the first party they had had in the number one\u2019s apartment in\u2026 forever, actually. There was something very unsettling about that. Deku was social. He was enthusiastic and a people person and thrived in helping and loving others.\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku was not made for loneliness. He was made to be happy.\u00a0\n\n\nThe man, unaware of Katsuki\u2019s brooding, answered casually, \u201cWell, yeah, Kachaan. I guess I needed a friend.\u201d\n\n\nHis heart hurt at the nonchalant tone. \u201cYou \n\nhave \n\nfriends.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThe green-haired man waved him off over his shoulder. \u201cYeah but all of you are busy with more important things.\u201d\n\n\nKatsuki stiffened. \u201cYou\u2019re important.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku\u2019s shoulders fell slightly and he turned to face his friend. \u201cDon\u2019t do this, Kachaan.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re slipping back into old habits, then you need to-,\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d he interrupted, waving around his spatula. Yagi, who seemed to be able to sense his master\u2019s unease, departed from Katsuki\u2019s side and ran to Izuku\u2019s. The man sighed, his smile reappearing as he knelt to reassure the canine that he was alright. \u201cIt\u2019s just nice to have someone to listen to everything, okay? And he gives great cuddles.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMaybe I should get one,\u201d Katsuki scoffed, trying to judge whether or not he should jump on that last statement. \u201cEiji is a horrible listener as of lately. Can\u2019t get one word in edgewise. Driving me up the damn wall.\u201d\n\n\nIzuku turned, green eyes alight. \u201cYou have me.\u201d\n\n\nBakugou paused, lifting his head. \u201cWhat?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou have me, Kachaan,\u201d he repeated, soft and sure and so Izuku. He stood and walked over to him.\u00a0\n\n\n\"You'll have me,\" Izuku grinned. \"Until every single galaxy dies.\"\u00a0\n\n\nHe bumped Katsuki's shoulder. \"You'll have me.\"\n\n\nSomething in his stomach curled. He pushed his shoulder back against Izuku\u2019s. \u201cYou have me too, you know. I\u2019m here to\u2026 listen too. You don\u2019t need a damn dog when you have me.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku searched his eyes, but the smile he gave was not as genuine as Katsuki would have hoped. He wondered when his smiles stopped making it to his eyes.\u00a0\n\n\n\nTell me, Deku\n\n, he wanted to scream. \n\nTalk to me. Tell me what\u2019s wrong so I can fix it\n\n.\u00a0\n\n\nGreen eyes probed his. He swallowed, quietly laughing sorrowfully. \u201cKachaan, I-,\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThe door flew open and Eijirou\u2019s voice echoed down the hallway. \u201cWe\u2019re here! Jirou brought the booze!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nKatsuki turned to yell back, \u201cTook you long enough, you damn idiots!\u201d\n\n\nBy the time he turned back, ready to hear what Izuku had to say, the man had returned to the other side of the kitchen and his cooking. His back was to Katsuki, who felt like he had just lost his chance at hearing the truth.\u00a0\n\n\nFor the rest of the party, Katsuki tried to get a second of alone time to wrangle the truth out of his childhood friend, but Eijirou hung off his arm constantly, and while he adored his boyfriend, he found it increasingly annoying as the night continued. The nerd seemed content to sit with his new furry friend, however, and Katsuki forced himself to be satisfied that at least he had gotten some form of companion, even if this one could not talk or actually listen.\u00a0\n\n\nAs people began to leave, he knelt in front of the dog and petted his long fur. \u201cListen here, mutt. You take care of my Deku. He takes a lot of work and he\u2019ll talk your ear off, but he\u2019s easy to love. Make sure\u2026\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nHe paused, suddenly overcome with emotions. Gosh, there was so much that Katsuki missed about Izuku. He missed hearing the laugh that he saved for just them. He missed the wide smile and the glistening eyes. He missed the harmless pranks, the crude jokes that shocked anyone who heard them fall from the goodie-two-shoes\u2019 mouth. He missed the snowball fights and the movie marathons and the never ending fountain of love that poured from his every word. \n\n\nHe desperately missed everything that Izuku was.\u00a0\n\n\nKatsuki had not realized how much he had lost by becoming so distant. Ever since Auntie\u2019s funeral, they had grown farther and farther apart. While he still considered Izuku his best friend, that would never change, there was a divide between them now that Katsuki did not know how to jump.\u00a0\n\n\nThat had to change.\u00a0\n\n\nHe swallowed, shocked that tears were turning his vision blurry. He raised his head to where Izuku and Eijirou were doing dishes. The redhead was going on about how delicious Izuku\u2019s cooking was, while the other listened attentively, accepting the compliments with humble misdirection.\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku was always there for everyone else, whether it was to save their lives or listen to them ramble about American cuisine.\u00a0\n\n\nWhen was the last time that anyone was really there for Izuku?\n\n\nHe refocused on the retriever. \u201cMake sure you love him, okay? He\u2019s\u2026 he is the best man I know, and he deserves to feel loved. You can do that, can\u2019t you?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nYagi barked, tongue wagging like his tail. Katsuki took it as an oath.\u00a0\n\n\nKiri finished drying the dishes and walked over to his boyfriend. \u201cReady to go, babe?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nKatsuki nodded. \u201cThanks again, Izu.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThe green haired man smiled as he wiped his hands on the dish towel. \u201cThanks for coming.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cOf course!\u201d Eijirou snorted. \u201cAs if we would miss an Izuku Midoriya party! I mean, I've never even seen your apartment before, dude! We should have get togethers more often. Especially if this handsome guy is sticking around.\u201d\n\n\nAt this he stooped to happily rub the dog\u2019s face. The dog snorted and butted his nose against Kirishima\u2019s hand.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYagi, leave Kiri alone,\u201d Izuku commanded softly. The dog immediately obeyed, turning to his place at his master\u2019s side. \u201cDrive safe, you guys.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nKatsuki wanted to ask what he had been going to say before. He wanted to know what Izuku thought he could not trust his Kachaan with. He wanted to know what had stolen his Deku, where it was, and how he could kill it. He wanted to know who had taken his laughter, his motivation.\u00a0\n\n\nHe wanted to know who had stolen his heart.\u00a0\n\n\nHe wanted to kill them.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cTake care, nerd,\u201d is what he said instead. \u201cTake care of that stupid cough. And get a real therapist, not a dog.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku laughed lightly. Katsuki wished the sound was not so fake. \u201cWill do, Kachaan. Goodnight.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cNight!\u201d Eijirou said, bowing respectfully and exiting.\u00a0\n\n\nBakugou waited a moment. He held Izuku\u2019s gaze and whispered, \u201cGoodnight, nerd.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku\u2019s eyes shuttered and he swallowed. \u201cGoodnight, Kachaan.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nAs Katsuki closed the door behind him, he felt so scared his hands shook.\n\n\nWhy did that goodnight sound like a goodbye?\n\n\n\n\n\nIzuku blinked the tears away. They returned just as quickly.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cIzu?\u201d Kachaan asked, leaning closer across the table.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI think you stumped him, babe,\u201d Kiri laughed, blush dusting his cheeks. \u201cWho knew that this was the way to stop his ramblings. We should have asked him to be our best man a long time ago.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku felt the branches in his chest clench so violently that he doubled over in a coughing fit. He waved away their concerned cries, gesturing to the glass of water beside his plate. He desperately tried to catch his breath and force the deadly vines back into the pit of his stomach. Once the hacking was mostly under control, he straightened, covering the last few coughs in his elbow.\u00a0\n\n\nHe raised his eyes to meet Katsuki\u2019s. Crimson shone with unadulterated love.\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku felt the thorns twist tighter around his heart.\u00a0\n\n\nHe was such a fool.\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku laughed his pain off just as he always did and mustered up a disbelieving smile. \u201cYou - you want me?\u201d\n\n\nBakugou scoffed. \u201cWell duh, shitty nerd. Who else would we ask?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku had an answer. \u201cDenki, maybe? Hanta?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDenki is pretty occupied planning his own wedding,\u201d Kiri replied easily.\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku tried not to let the admission that he was the second choice even now hurt him. It did not work.\u00a0\n\n\nSomething must have shown in his eyes, because Kachaan quickly added, \u201cAnd you\u2019re my best friend, idiot. I wouldn\u2019t want anyone else.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nHow often had Izuku prayed he would hear those words from Katsuki? God, it must have been often. He stared at the pair in front of him. How he ever thought he could have compared was beyond him. They were perfect. Eijirou stared at Katsuki like he hung the sun in the sky, and Katsuki looked at Eijirou as if he was the only thing keeping him breathing. Their intertwined hands on the table caught the sun, glinting off the beautiful engagement ring on the redhead\u2019s finger.\u00a0\n\n\nIn that small second, Izuku wished he was not so selfless. He wished all the heartbreak and pain had made him bitter, harsh, unforgiving. He wished it had not made him kind.\u00a0\n\n\nThe second was gone soon after, and in its place was a dull acceptance. He grinned, shoulders shaking with a light laugh. \u201cWell, I\u2019d be honored. Fair warning though, most of my stories will be embarrassing.\u201d\n\n\nThe couple laughed along with him. Neither of them noticed the tears in his eyes.\u00a0\n\n\nNeither of them noticed the small stream of blood that he quickly wiped away.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of Izuku\u2019s favorite things to do was talk at schools. He had been so excited when Aizawa had invited him and Shinso to talk to the Yuuei heroics class.\u00a0\n\n\nBesides, it was probably the last opportunity he would get to pass on his knowledge and experience, and he was more than willing to sacrifice patrol time to do just that.\u00a0\n\n\nThe students, each wide-eyed and full of big dreams, listened with rapt attention to the number one hero. Afterward, he signed autographs and answered dozens of questions. He felt so warm by the time they left, warmer than he had in months. The branches within his chest felt so small in comparison to the legacy he was leaving behind.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d Hitoshi\u2019s voice brought him back to reality. \u201cIt\u2019s our old classroom.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku followed him into the empty room. Nostalgia swept through him like a cool summer breeze. \u201cGod, it looks exactly the same.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cDo you remember when Todoroki turned Iida into an ice cube because he wouldn\u2019t shut up about the dress code?\u201d The mind-controlling hero smirked, tracing his fingers over his old desk.\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku snorted, leaning against his own. \u201cOr when Mina accidentally melted her homework straight through her desk?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nShinso chuckled smugly. \u201cOr the time when Bakugou tripped over Sensei in his sleeping back trying to get your attention?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThe silence that followed was not as heavy as it could have been. Izuku felt the tickle in his throat and mustered up a smile. He swallowed, hoping that he did not break down into a coughing fit in front of his friend. However, the plant within him did as it well pleased, and the choking sound soon filled the quiet room. He gripped the desk in front of him, bending over to expel the horribly painful flowers from his throat.\u00a0\n\n\nHis stomach flipped at the sight of them. He could barely make out the purple in the three hyacinths. They were drenched in blood, the sticky substance leaking onto Izuku\u2019s hands as he held them, staring in fear. He barely had time to look up at Shinso before another round of hacking overtook him. He shuddered, tears pricking the edges of his eyes as he felt more blood fill his mouth. Four more flowers expelled themselves from his lungs, crimson in color and horribly large. He staggered, body trembling with fear.\u00a0\n\n\nHis breathing picked up, wide eyes searching for the grounding purple in Hitoshi\u2019s, who knelt before him with a fearful gaze. His friend took one flower from him. \u201cWhat\u2026 what does that mean?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku felt tears begin to drip down his face. \u201cI- I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t die.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nWhat a stupid sentence. Everyone died. His mother, All Might. Izuku was just a small tragedy in a long history of tragedies. Shinso said it like it was a crime, an impossibility. He said it like it was truly something that could never happen.\u00a0\n\n\nExcept that it was happening right in front of them.\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku felt his chest seize again.\u00a0\n\n\nHe was dying.\u00a0\n\n\nHe was \n\ndying\n\n.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard that repeating a word makes it lose meaning,\u201d He muttered. He looked around their old classroom and wished that everything could go back to the way it was. \u201cI\u2019ve stayed up repeating his name over and over and over again, praying that he will mean less to me with each breath. But then - then I see him at work the next day and it\u2019s like I fall in love all over again.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nHitoshi pulled the stupid flowers from his shaking hands and laced their fingers together. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have mentioned Bakubitch. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nMidoriya shook his head. \u201cNot your fault. It\u2019s mine. It\u2019s all my fault.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t say that,\u201d He squeezed his scarred hands.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny,\u201d Izuku huffed wetly. \u201cTrying to get over someone who was never even mine. Having to heal a heart I broke by myself.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cStop it, Izu,\u201d Hitoshi warned sadly, eyes misting. Why was he crying? Had Izuku done that too? \u201cYou are wonderful. Anyone would be lucky to be loved by you.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cSometimes I pretend that he wishes he were mine,\u201d He admitted, ashamed. \u201cI create this entire fantasy in my mind that he secretly wants me, that he\u2019ll leave Kiri at the altar and run to me like he\u2019s always \n\nbeen \n\nmine. I do it so much it infects my dreams, Toshi. And then - then I wake up and I sometimes forget that it\u2019s all in my head.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku sighed. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want me. And he\u2019s not mine.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re allowed to be angry, Izu.\u201d Shinso pulled him closer. He ran a hand through wild green locks, trying to pull him back to reality. \u201cYou don\u2019t owe it to anyone to be okay with all this.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI chose him, but he didn\u2019t choose me.\u201d He took a deep, rattling, soul aching breath. The vines in his chest crawled into the entrance of his throat. He did not have much longer now. \u201cAnd that\u2019s okay. That is not Kachaan\u2019s fault. I can\u2019t be mad at him, not when\u2026 not when he\u2019s so happy.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWhat about you, Izuku?\u201d Hitoshi hissed, but the anger was only to disguise his tears. \u201cWhat about your happiness?\u201d\n\n\nThe Number One hero smiled sadly, wistfully, almost like he was already gone. \u201cMy happiness has never been part of the equation.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSeeing the nerd so close to the edge made Katsuki want to throw up. He was unsure what he expected when he saw Brainwash\u2019s eyes widen with fear and heard him mutter, \u201cDeku\u2019s on the roof\u201d, but this was not it. He expected hysterical crying, mourning a civilian he could not save, maybe loyal and happy Yagi had died.\u00a0\n\n\nHe did not expect to see that same dead look from his mother\u2019s funeral. He did not expect to see the empty vessel of his best friend, staring at the horizon, looking for all the world like he wished to disappear. Silent tears fell down freckled cheeks as he bent over the railing.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cDeku, get away from the edge.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nTo his horror, the hero barely acknowledged him. There was a soft hum and a tilt of his head, and nothing more.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cDeku, I\u2019m serious.\u201d Katsuki moved towards him, terror mounting with each passing moment of silence. \u201cCome over here, idiot.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s the wedding planning going, Kachaan?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThe question pushed him off-kilter. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI heard Todoroki and Momo referred you to their florist. Good idea. The flowers at their wedding were beautiful.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cDeku, get away from the damn ledge.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku hummed again, leaning farther over the abyss. \u201cYou should get Mina to color coordinate everything, though. She\u2019s a goddess when it comes to that kind of stuff.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nKatsuki could feel his heart rampaging in his chest. The wind tousled Deku\u2019s hair, twisting those green locks around dead eyes. It was so so wrong. Deku was not \n\nthis\n\n. \u201cYou\u2019re okay, Deku. You\u2019re okay, just step away from the railing. Please.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nMaybe if he said it enough, he could keep lying to himself and believe it was true.\u00a0\n\n\nHe was finally close enough to grab him. He gripped his shoulders tightly, jerking him away from the danger of falling, and pulled him toward the middle of the roof. Desperately, he ran his fingers through Izuku\u2019s hair, down his face, counted freckles like a deranged man, and thanked God he had not wasted a minute before running up the stairs to the roof.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cKachaan?\u201d\n\n\nKatsuki, who had been wiping the tears from his best friend\u2019s cheeks, paused long enough to answer. \u201cYeah, nerd?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWould you miss me if I died?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nHis heart froze in his chest.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku reached up slowly and wrapped his cold - Christ, his fingers were \n\nfreezing \n\n- around Bakugou\u2019s wrists. \u201cYou\u2019ll miss me, right? Tell me at least you\u2019ll think of me every once in a while?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat the ever-loving \n\nfuck \n\nare you talking about?\u201d Terror wormed its way into his chest, making it difficult for him to breathe.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI know that we\u2019ve had our differences and we\u2019ve grown apart, but you\u2019ll miss me, right?\u201d Izuku sobbed, breath hitching. \u201cGod, Kachaan, I\u2019m so scared.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t dying, you idiot.\u201d Katsuki\u2019s grip tightened. He was sure that it was becoming painful, but he did not care. Images of a dead Izuku Midoriya flashed across his brain like a horror film reel. He choked on his own gasp and shook his head. \u201cYou aren\u2019t dying, Izu. What is going on?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI tried so hard, you know,\u201d Izuku laughed hysterically. \u201cTo get over it. I tried to convince myself that I was insane. I was just wallowing or I was making a big deal out of nothing. God, you were right, Kachaan. I\u2019m just a hopeless crybaby who can\u2019t handle his emotions and now it\u2019s killing me.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nKatsuki had never been more scared in his entire life. He desperately tried to keep up with the conversation, but he had no idea what was going on. He had let this happen. He had continued to put off asking about Izuku, his health, how he was doing. He used business as an excuse, the wedding as a way of avoiding the emotional confrontation he hated so much. He had prioritized himself when Izuku was so clearly suffering and now something was horribly, devastatingly \n\nwrong\n\n.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAnd I get that I\u2019m not enough,\u201d Izuku continued manically. \u201cI get that I\u2019m too clumsy and I\u2019m ugly and I talk too much - hell, I\u2019m doing it right now - and I can\u2019t save everyone and I\u2019ve failed. I\u2019ve failed, I\u2019ve failed, I\u2019ve failed!\u201d\n\n\nKatsuki shook him. \u201cWho the fuck told you that? Tell me and I\u2019ll kill the fucker, Deku. I\u2019ll fucking incinerate the one who taught you that. I want names, I want descriptions, and I want to murder them, you hear me? Look at me!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nGreen eyes met crimson.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t any of those stupid lies.\u201d Bakugou\u2019s grip softened, hoping his eyes did the same. \u201cYou are smart and funny and gorgeous.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nAlmost to emphasize his point, he ran his hands through those beautiful foresty locks. \u201cYou don\u2019t talk too much; your rambling is endearing. You save so many people, Izu. You\u2019re a \n\nhero\n\n.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t save myself,\u201d Izuku wheezed. \u201cI can never save myself.\u201d\n\n\nKatsuki swallowed, tears falling from his chin. \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to. Let others do that.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nHe pushed closer, into Izuku\u2019s personal space. He crowded so close so that he could chase away those horrible thoughts. He would fight them all, he\u2019d explode the fuckers so they could never hurt Izuku again.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cLet \n\nme\n\n. Let me save you, Izu. Please.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku sobbed into Katsuki\u2019s shoulder, and Katuski desperately wished he could interpret the sound of sorrow.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cLet me be your hero.\u201d\n\n\nHe chuckled sadly, shaking his head. \u201cYou\u2019ve always been my hero, Kachaan.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHow long do you have?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nIt was the first question that Shota asked him when he opened the door. Izuku\u2019s hand, still raised to knock against the wood, froze. His eyes widened and he swallowed. \u201cPardon?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nHis former teacher, now retired from hero work and just mentoring students, examined him with sad eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not your friends, Problem Child. I know you have hanahaki.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku\u2019s heart clenched. He had never acknowledged the title to what was happening to him. Part of him hoped it was just a fluke, that it was all a bad dream, that he had been hit with some quirk all those years ago and had never gotten over it.\u00a0\n\n\nPart of him still hoped to wake up one day and the pain would be gone, Katsuki would be at his door, and all would be well.\u00a0\n\n\nHe must have looked a right mess. He knew the bags under his eyes were dark, his gaze was vacant. His cheekbones were more prominent than ever. While his form was still full and the symbol of bravery and heroic strength, he moved like an old man; every gesture creaked like ancient wooden boards. He looked at himself in the mirror in the mornings and wondered how more people \n\nhadn\u2019t \n\nnoticed. Then again, he had always been good at pretending to be invincible.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cMidoriya?\u201d Sensei\u2019s hand came up to rest on his shoulder. His grip tightened, grounding him when all he wanted to do was float away. \u201cHow long?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku snorted sadly. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m shocked it hasn\u2019t happened already.\u201d\n\n\nAizawa sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s Bakugou, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nHe nodded.\u00a0\n\n\nHis teacher opened the door and let him inside. He guided his favorite student to the couch.\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku felt some of his anxiety and sorrow ebb away in this familiar place. Especially after Yagi died, he had grown close to his old teacher. He had a wonderful ability to convince Izuku he was worth something, even if it was just for a little while.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re smart, Izuku,\u201d the use of his first name washed over him like a warm bath. \u201cIf you had to put a timer on it, how long would you say you have?\u201d\n\n\nHe swallowed, shoulders falling as he leaned back into the soft cushion. He shifted, meeting his mentor\u2019s eyes. Ebony was filled with empathetic adoration. A smile quirked at the edges of his lips. \u201cI think I\u2019ll get to make my best man\u2019s speech at Hitoshi and Denki\u2019s wedding. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll make it much farther than that.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nShota moved some straggly curls from his face. \u201cYou\u2019re speaking at his too, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHmm?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cBakugou and Kirishima\u2019s.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku nodded. \u201cI was honored they asked.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cIt hurts though, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nHe whimpered. \u201cYeah.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nHis teacher\u2019s hand remained in his hair, soothingly untangling the mess atop his head. \u201cYou always wore your heart on your sleeve. Even in your first year, I could tell that you loved him. You challenged each other, pushed one another to the limit. You inspired each other. He loved you too.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nIt hurt most because it was true. Katsuki loved him very much, it just wasn\u2019t the love that Izuku wanted. \u201cI know.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI suppose me trying to convince you to get the surgery wouldn\u2019t work.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cNah.\u201d He lifted his eyes again. \u201cAre - are you crying?\u201d\n\n\nA thumb brushed his cheek. \u201cI wish you were allowed to be happy, Problem Child.\u201d\n\n\nIzuku sighed. His own eyes were getting misty. \u201cMe too.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou came to ask me about One for All, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\nThe younger man sputtered, a surprised laugh escaping his trembling lips. \u201cHow did you know that?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nShota shrugged, smile smug. \u201cI do have a few years of experience, Problem Child. Besides, you were taught that your Quirk was the only important thing about you for your entire life. I assumed it would be weighing heavily on your mind.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku nodded. \u201cIt is. I don\u2019t know who to give it to.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cLet it end with you.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThe curtness of Shota\u2019s words cut through him. He flexed his hands. Scars crisscrossed across his skin.\u201cBut it\u2019s not done-,\u201d\n\n\nAizawa scooted closer, grabbing his shoulders. \u201cYes, it is, Izuku. One for All served its purpose. You took down Shigaraki and ended All for One your first year as a pro hero. Its purpose was fulfilled. Don\u2019t burden someone else with the legacy which Yagi placed on you. Don\u2019t make another child shoulder that weight.\u201d\n\n\nHe sniffed. No one understood this burden as Aizawa did. His entire life, his Quirk (or lack thereof) had been the only important thing about him. His entire thought process was dedicated to what he could do for others, who he could help next, what could he sacrifice so that others could be happy. Shota once said that it was because he was raised in a society that taught him his worth was subservient to everyone else\u2019s; he was probably right. Maybe that was why Izuku never got mad that Bakugou was not his. Maybe it was why he didn\u2019t fight back in high school. He had never deserved the things that other people got, that people with Quirks deserved. He took each blow like it was expected, like he had earned it, like it was \n\nright\n\n.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThere is a tragedy in being so selfless,\u201d Shota hummed softly, hand back in his hair. The other wiped tears from his cheeks. \u201cYou have believed that everyone else must come before yourself, and no one was ever able to help you believe otherwise.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Izuku leaned into the comfort that his mentor provided. It was so seldom that he felt warm anymore.\u00a0\n\n\nAizawa smiled, but he had never looked more devastated. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\n\nHe shrugged in reply, content to let himself revel in this small relief. He hardly ever felt content now. He was always cold, always empty. It was impossible to find warmth living with thorns crushing his heart. But this, this small pleasure, was enough.\u00a0\n\n\nIt had to be.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve done so well, Izuku.\u201d\n\n\nFor a moment, Izuku let himself believe it.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nHis speech was lovely. It was the thing that Katsuki remembered most about that day.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI think the first time I realized that Katsuki and Eijirou were meant for each other was six months after our resident explosion made the mistake of dating me.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThe crowd all laughed at the jab. Katsuki snorted, squeezing Kiri\u2019s fingers between his own as they watched their best friend stand and address their company. Izuku had worn a green tux, which brought out the colors of his hair and eyes. He looked radiant and happier than he had been in months. Katsuki was put at ease by staring at his best friend\u2019s gorgeous grin. It made him feel whole.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI remember watching Katsuki stare at Eiji like he had hung the stars in the sky,\u201d Izuku continued. \u201cThat was the first time I believed that soulmates might actually exist.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nKatsuki\u2019s breath caught. Beside him, he could hear Kiri already begin to sniffle.\n\n\n\u201cThe first time I realized how in love Katsuki truly was was about two weeks after that. A quick turnaround, I know.\u201d another round of laughter. \u201cHe barged into my room at two in the morning before one of the biggest hero tests we ever took. I was burning the midnight oil, half my hair was sticking up, and I was one cup of coffee away from insanity, and he looked like he had just run a marathon from murdering clowns.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nKatsuki snorted, shoulder shaking from barely contained cackles.\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku cleared his throat and continued, grin softening to something unbearably fond. \u201cI asked him what was wrong, and he looked me right in the eyes and said, \u201cDeku, you piece of shit. I think this is what it\u2019s like to be fucking high.\u201d\"\n\n\nFrom the front table, the Bakusquad finally let their laughter break the silence. Mina almost fell from her chair, only stopped by Denki\u2019s quick reflexes. Katsuki and Eijirou snorted, and Eijirou leaned over to kiss his cheek.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cKatsuki is a planner. Anyone who meets him knows that he has a strict schedule that he sticks to closer than scripture.\u201d Izuku paused, gaze shifting to rest on the happy couple. \u201cEijirou Kirishima was the best thing that he never planned.\u201d\n\n\nKatsuki wiped his cheek. God, he was becoming such a sap.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known Katsuki for my whole life, and I never thought that anyone would be good enough for him. He was always too bright, too strong, too perfect for anyone to meet my expectations of his other half,\u201d Izuku shrugged, placing another notecard in the back of his stack as he continued. \u201cIt has been a pleasure to be proved wrong every single day that Kirishima loves him.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nFinally, Eiji broke. His quiet cries filled in the background music to the remainder of Deku\u2019s speech.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWhatever happens, they are always there for each other. They protect each other, love each other, remind each other of their worth every single day.\u201d the number one hero paused, reaching up to wipe away his own tears. \u201cThey are two halves of one whole, and it is a pleasure to be a part of their journey. When they asked me to be their best man, I did not think I would ever be able to convey just how much their love has changed me, how they have changed each other. However, I whittled it down to two things.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nIzu cleared his throat, and Katsuki watched him force his tears to remain in his eyes. \u201cEiji told me once, a month after their first date, that loving Katsuki was as effortless as breathing. He described loving him like a warm hug, a ray of sunshine through the clouds, the first rain of spring. Eiji was a poet, Katsuki his muse and subject, and he wanted to fill libraries with the novels he would write about him.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nKatsuki turned to his husband, who stared at him with so much love he could hardly bear it.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cKatsuki turned to me the week before he asked Eijirou to marry him and told me that he had never known how to love himself until Eiji loved him first.\u201d Izuku laughed wetly. \u201cWhich is not nearly as many words, but the same idea.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThe crowd, being reduced to various forms of happy crying, responded with pathetic laughter. Not that the grooms could judge them. They were suffering from the same.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cLove is unbeatable,\u201d the best man claimed with an air of finality. \u201cIt is a force that cannot be stopped, cannot be moved. It takes residence in you and grows until it consumes you. It is the most wonderful thing that any of us can experience, and they found it.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nHe turned back to the couple and raised his glass. \u201cTo many more years of continued discovery. Please join me in toasting to Eijirou and Katsuki Kirigou!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThe crowd responded with loud hurrahs, and Katsuki kissed his husband, a happier man he could not imagine.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nKota laid his head on Izuku\u2019s shoulder as they sat in the grass outside of the dorms. \u201cHeroics is going well. I\u2019m ranked third. Eri is second.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku raised a hand and ruffled the boy\u2019s black hair. \u201cThat\u2019s amazing! Kota, bud, I\u2019m so proud of you!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThe teenager shied away from the praise, blush dusting his cheeks.\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku leaned down to be on his level, eyes sincere. \u201cSo proud.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nKota smiled shyly. \u201cThanks.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHave you perfected that new move yet?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nHe huffed. \u201cOnly took me two months.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThe pro hero chuckled. \u201cHey, don\u2019t put yourself down. You\u2019re here to learn, remember? Taking two months to perfect a special move is important.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSays the man who can change the weather with a single punch.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku flicked his ear. \u201cAnd we both know how long it took me to get where I am today. So cut yourself some slack, bud. We all have learning curves.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Kota groaned. He swallowed, glancing at his brother and then back to his hands. \u201cCan\u2026 can you keep a secret?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThe twenty-five-year-old forced himself not to laugh. \u201cOf course, Kota.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nHis charge swallowed and murmured something softly and quickly.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to speak up just a little bit, buddy,\u201d Izuku whispered. \u201cYou know you can trust me.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nKota wrung his hands together. Izuku reached out to stop him from picking at his fingers. \u201cHey, hey, it\u2019s just me.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThat seemed to comfort the boy and he sighed. \u201cI\u2026 I think I like Eri.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku felt the first genuine grin spread across his face in a long time. \u201cKota! That\u2019s wonderful!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThe kid shied away from the excitement. \u201cShut up old man! Someone will hear you!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHave you told her?\u201d Izuku asked gently, smile fading to something soft and warm.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d Kota seemed mortified at the thought. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d the green-haired man glanced towards the fluffy clouds that dotted the sky. \u201cIf you don\u2019t do it now, you might never get the chance. She might pick someone else if you don\u2019t try now.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cLike you and Uncle Bakugou?\u201d\n\n\nIzuku stiffened. He glanced back at his brother. Kota stared back with a knowing gleam in his eyes. \u201cAm I that obvious?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cNope,\u201d Kota shook his head. \u201cI just know what to look for.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThe pro hummed, wrapping an arm around the boy. \u201cBut yes, like me and Kachaan. I don\u2019t want you to feel like I do, buddy. And who knows\u2026 she might like you too.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThe boy pushed him off, punching him in the arm.\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku feigned pain, rubbing the spot with a grimace. \u201cOw! Man, what a punch!\u201d\n\n\nKota could not fight his grin. \u201cYou think so?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWatch out. Next thing you know, you\u2019ll be the next Symbol of Hope!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThe boy rolled his eyes, elbowing his adopted brother in the side. \u201cShut up. As if I could ever replace you.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku bent over and kissed his hair. He pulled back, meeting those big eyes and smiling warmly. \u201cI can think of no better successor.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nKota\u2019s face turned as red as a tomato and he looked away. \u201cShut up, you old sap.\u201d\n\n\nDeku laughed loudly and pulled the kid in for a hug.\u00a0\n\n\nThey stayed there until the sun set behind the gates. Kota gave him one last hug before returning to the dorms before curfew. Izuku watched him go, pride pouring out of him like molten gold. He stuffed his hands in his pockets and turned to leave.\u00a0\n\n\nA white scarf wrapped around his arm and he stopped. Strong arms pulled him into a warm chest, and Izuku fell into the embrace like a child.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take care of him,\u201d Aizawa promised.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Izuku whispered.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nHe volunteered for the mission. That was the first signal that something was off.\u00a0\n\n\nNot that he volunteered at all, that was all too Deku. No, it was how he had taken one look at the mission debrief, glanced at the hero roster, and made a single change. Eijirou was supposed to be on infiltration. His name was switched out with Izuku\u2019s on the chart, and then turned back in.\u00a0\n\n\nKatsuki should have realized. Izuku never altered Iida\u2019s mission plans. They were often foolproof. However, something in his gaze had caused the former class president to accept the change with a single nod and send it around to the rest of the group.\u00a0\n\n\nHe did not even remember the villain\u2019s name; that was the least important thing about that day. He did remember Izuku\u2019s tired eyes, his weary smile, and how he leaned into Brainwash like he was the only way the greenette could feel warm. He remembered the lack of murmuring from the nerd, the silence in which he suited up, and the lack of goodbye as he set off. He remembered watching through the hacked security footage of the warehouse, noticing his slumped shoulders, his cough, and the way he walked.\u00a0\n\n\nHe walked with death in his shadow, and Katsuki did not \n\nnotice\n\n.\u00a0\n\n\nThe security footage cut out twelve minutes into the mission, but none of them were too worried. Deku was on a direct link with Earphone Jack where he could send updates. They were backup just in case things went wrong.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI hate the waiting part,\u201d Jirou hummed.\n\n\n\u201cAs if anything is going to happen to Deku,\u201d Kiri chuckled, crossing his arms. \u201cHe\u2019s \n\nDeku\n\n.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThirty minutes into the mission, the sound hero straightened from her bowed position. Jirou leaned back in her chair, glancing at Shinso. \u201cHe wants a direct line with you.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI swear, if he wants to nerd out about this villain\u2019s quirk I\u2019m hanging up,\u201d The brainwashing hero rolled his eyes and dished out his phone.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cPut him on speaker,\u201d Katsuki grinned. \u201cWe can all shout at him when he goes off.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThe purple-haired man snorted and did as asked. He held out the phone for the others to crowd around. It had been too long since Katsuki had heard the nerd ramble about quirks. He leaned into Eijirou\u2019s shoulder and closed his eyes, ready to hear the voice that had the excitement of a child yet the timbre of a man.\u00a0\n\n\nThe phone line crackled and the voice surfaced.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI think you and Denki are going to need a new best man, Shinso.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nShinsou chuckled, rolling his eyes. \u201cRecovery really gonna take you that long?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nA hitched breath that could have passed as a laugh sounded through the phone. \u201c\n\nToshi\n\n.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nImmediately, his face paled and the smile disappeared. \u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nKatsuki felt the mood shift in the room. Something was horrible, terribly \n\nwrong\n\n.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI wrote it down, so just get someone to read the speech, okay?\u201d Izuku laughed lightly, and only then did Katsuki hear the wetness in his words. Blood. \u201cI am so sorry that-,\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you \n\ndare \n\napologize to me,\u201d Shinsou suddenly snarled, harsh and angry and heartbroken. \u201cYou don\u2019t owe me \n\nanything\n\n.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cShinsou, what the hell is going on?\u201d Jirou whispered, low enough that Deku would not hear.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYeah, I do,\u201d Izuku\u2019s next chuckle came out as a whimper. Katsuki almost wanted to tell Shinsou to turn off speaker mode because this sounded like a personal conversation, but he was speechless. \u201cI owe you so much. I - Toshi, I think that if I didn\u2019t have you, this would have happened months ago.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t say that-,\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI was always meant for tragedy, Toshi. I mean, I thought I would have been dead by the end of middle school. I probably should have been.\u201d\n\n\nKatsuki\u2019s breath had ceased. Something caved within him and his heart stuttered with the image of Izuku\u2019s green curls matted with crimson, body broken from his roof-top fall, poisoned words spilling from the blonde\u2019s mouth the catalyst. \u201cWhat is he talking about, Brainwash?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd then I got the chance to keep going even when I shouldn\u2019t have,\u201d He laughed pathetically. \u201cAnd I got to be a hero.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the best hero, Izu,\u201d Toshi managed brokenly, leaning closer to the phone.\u00a0\n\n\nKatsuki felt his heart flip at the nickname. That was his nickname for Izuku. He had coined it when they were still little brats together, unaware of the tragedy they would encounter, the fame, the glory, and the heartbreak. When had that changed?\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d He croaked.\u00a0\n\n\nShinso growled. \u201cFuck you, yes you are.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku laughed, but nothing about this was funny. Katsuki felt like he was back on that roof, desperate and lost and so out of his depth he wanted to scream. \u201cSomeone get him a medic.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nNo one moved. A horrible understanding settled across the room like a fatal blanket.\u00a0\n\n\nNothing could be done.\u00a0\n\n\nKatsuki fumed against the idea. \u201cEarphones, get him a fucking ambulance.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cKat,\u201d Eijirou began, but Katsuki slapped his hand away.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI need you to look after Yagi for me, just until Kota gets his own place when he graduates.\u201d the number one hero choked, and Katsuki could almost smell the blood on his tongue. \u201cHe likes Dagobah Beach the most for walking, okay? Tell Kota there\u2019s a letter for him under my bed. There\u2019s a whole box of them, Toshi. Make sure everyone gets them, okay? I - I need you to - to do that for me. Please?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nBefore Izuku could continue his desperate rambling, Shinso let out a choked sob. \u201cI\u2019ve got it, Izu. Don\u2019t - don\u2019t you worry about a damn thing, okay? I\u2019ve got this.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nKatsuki felt a horrible chill beginning to creep up his spine. This could not be happening. Izuku was not allowed to die. He tried to imagine a life without Izuku Midoriya by his side, but it was impossible. They had been together for their entire lives. He was not sure he knew how to function without his annoying, loud, bright, wonderful, absolutely fucking amazing presence.\u00a0\n\n\nHe was not sure he could go on without Izuku. He was not sure life continued after Izuku.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cGod, I know we\u2019ve been expecting this, but somehow, I\u2019m still so scared.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nDenki turned into his fiance\u2019s shoulder and began to cry. Shinso reached up with shaking hands and carded his fingers through his partner\u2019s blonde locks. \u201cDon\u2019t be scared, Izu. Just keep talking to me, okay? Just keep\u2026\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nHe could not finish. Cold acceptance began to fill his eyes and he closed them against the horrible reality. \u201cJust keep talking.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI think that if it hadn\u2019t been him, it would have been you,\u201d Izuku admitted, shame lacing his tone like poison. \u201cSo even if I hadn\u2019t fallen in love with him, I would have with you, and I would still end up right back here.\u201d\n\n\nShinso sobbed loudly. Tears dripped down his cheeks, catching the afternoon light from the open windows. How could it be so beautiful outside, when the sun was dying?\n\n\n\u201cWho the fuck is he talking about?\u201d Katsuki demanded. Who the hell wouldn\u2019t love Izuku Midoriya?\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t supposed to live, Toshi.\u201d Izuku\u2019s voice was so heartbroken. All Katsuki wanted to do was heal him. \u201cThe universe is just fixing that mistake.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nShinso could offer no reply except louder cries.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cDo you know what purple hyacinths mean, Toshi? Forgiveness. Hanahaki is making me cough up flowers that mean forgiveness.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThe word made Katsuki stiffen. \u201cHold the fuck up-!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEven now,\u201d a new sound came from Izuku. Horrible, wet, bloody coughing. With dread, Katsuki recalled each time he had heard the nerd cough recently. Was this his secret? Was this the truth he could not bear to tell his Kachaan?\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cEven now I\u2019m begging,\u201d he continued hoarsely, brokenly. \u201cI\u2019m saying sorry.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nShinsou whimpered, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cSensei knew. Did I tell you that?\u201d his voice was fading, and Katsuki felt like the world was ending.\u00a0\n\n\nMaybe it was. Maybe this was the end.\u00a0\n\n\nHe was not sure the world went on after Izuku.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou did,\u201d Shinso whispered.\u00a0\n\n\nAnother round of coughing sent Jirou to her knees. She covered her ears and sobbed. Iida knelt beside her, attempting to console her through his own cries. Eijirou grabbed his hand in a vice, but Katsuki barely felt it. Nothing felt real. Nothing was real except Izuku\u2019s voice on that damn phone.\u00a0\n\n\nHis breath was coming quicker now. Izuku stammered, \u201cDon\u2019t listen, Toshi. Hang up before it happens. You don\u2019t need to hear it happen. Please.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not letting you die alone.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHE\u2019S NOT FUCKING DYING!\u201d Katsuki finally exploded, volume shooting up to a scream.\u00a0\n\n\nMore coughing, rougher, louder, more damning. More deadly.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cKachaan?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nKatsuki tore out of his husband\u2019s grip and stalked towards the phone. \u201cI\u2019m right here, nerd. Tell me who this fucker is and I\u2019ll kill him.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cKachaan,\u201d his tone switched from shock to contentment. \u201cKachaan.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThe blonde swallowed. \u201cI\u2019m right here, Izu. It\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he whispered.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t owe me a fucking thing.\u201d Katsuki growled through his tears. \u201cJust don\u2019t - don\u2019t\u2026 you can\u2019t die.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nHe was falling. Falling, falling, fallen.\u00a0\n\n\nThere was no recovery from this.\u00a0\n\n\nThere was no healing that could save his shattered heart.\u00a0\n\n\n\nHumpty Dumpty sat on a wall\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\u201cThank you for being my friend,\u201d he wheezed. \u201cYou made my life worth living.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThen keep living,\u201d Katsuki moaned. He took the phone from Shinso\u2019s shaking hands and held it up to his ear. \u201cKeep living for me, Izuku. We\u2019ll figure it out. We\u2019ll find this bastard and I\u2019ll kill him for you, okay?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\nHumpty Dumpty had a great fall\u2026\n\n\n\n\u201cKatsuki.\u201d\n\n\nThe blonde was prepared to beg. He was willing to give anything. \n\nPlease, God. Don\u2019t take him. You can have anything else. Not him. Please not him\n\n. \u201cYeah, nerd?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI love you.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nBeside him, Shinso finally collapsed. His legs gave out from under him and he thudded to the floor, Kaminari following him down.\u00a0\n\n\nKatsuki felt his breath escape him.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI love you too, Izuku. You\u2019re my best friend.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\nAll the king's horses and all the king's men\n\n\u2026\n\n\nThere was no answer.\u00a0\n\n\nKatsuki\u2019s heart stopped.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cIzuku?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nNothing. Nothing but dreadful, horrible, life ending silence.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cIzuku, I love you too.\u201d\n\n\n\nCouldn\u2019t put Humpty together again\n\n.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen they found him, he was holding the building like Atlas with the world on his shoulders, and he was dead. As Cementos lifted the last piece of rubble, he fell to the side, body limp and cold. Below him was the unconscious body of the villain and a sea of purple hyacinths, kept alive by Deku\u2019s final sacrifice. Blood had dripped from his mouth like a faulty water fountain, coating the violet petals with crimson.\u00a0\n\n\nKatsuki dropped to his knees beside him, pulling his broken and bloody body into his shaking arms. He pushed his hair from his face, pressing soft kisses to his freckles. He rocked back and forth, praying to anyone who was listening to bring him back, to take him instead. He begged to fix it, that he would be better, that he would save him if it was the last thing he did.\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku remained cold and still in his arms.\u00a0\n\n\nA soft smile graced his lips.\u00a0\n\n\nHe looked more at peace than he had in years.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nDear Katsuki,\n\n\n\n\nThere is so much I wish I could have told you. But, even if I could do it all over again, I wouldn\u2019t change a thing. In fifty years, I hope you can look back and say the same. The future is in your hands, Kachaan, and I know you\u2019ll do what\u2019s right. I know you will. You always have.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nI would have followed you anywhere, you know. To the gates of hell and back.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nI know that I was your best friend.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nYou were so much more.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nI was only a sentence in your life, and I have filled libraries with my thoughts of you. And that\u2019s okay. You were never meant to be mine. The anger I felt was so quick that I don\u2019t remember it, because love means wanting what is best for the other person, and I was never that for you. I want you to be so happy, Kachaan. I want you to be happier than you can ever imagine.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nI want you to have a happy ending, Kachaan, even if it never involves me.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nYou deserve to be happy.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nI hope that, in some small part, I helped create that.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nGo on, now. Go and live your life. Be great, be the best hero this world has ever seen.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nI love you, Katsuki. \u2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttached to the letter was a purple flower. It was beautiful.\u00a0\n\n\nThe blonde held it in his hands like it was the most precious treasure, and he wept.\u00a0\n"
