    "text": "Derek doesn't have a lot of practical experience with hospitals. He's never woken up in one before.\nIsaac is asleep in a chair. The angle of his neck makes Derek wince in sympathy.\n\"Isaac,\" Derek says.\nIsaac snaps awake immediately.\n\"You're-\"\n\"Where's Stiles?\"\n\"Stiles?\" Isaac asks.\nJesus. It's not like they know more than one.\nDerek pulls out an IV line, yanks plastic tubing out of his nose. It's unpleasant. Standing isn't great, his legs feel shaky from disuse.\n\"Where's Stiles?\" He asks again.\nIsaac stands up, cracks his neck, points out the door. \"Down the hall,\" he says, \"Room 304. Are you-\"\nDerek ignores him. There's a thin bathrobe hanging over a hook by the door to the bathroom. Derek puts it on before he heads out of the room.\n304 is four doors down on the left, Derek finds it half by sight, half by smell. He can hear Stiles' heartbeat: steady, strong.\nScott is slumped over by the bed, his position worse than Isaac's. Derek shakes him awake and he blinks up, slow, disbelieving.\n\"Is he-\" Derek starts. \"Is he-\"\nStiles bolts awake, sitting up, eyes wide and panicked. He says, \"Derek-\"\nDerek doesn't let him finish the thought, just climbs onto the small hospital bed and grabs Stiles' face, one hand on either side of his head.\nHe says, \"Stiles. Stiles. It's ok. You're awake now.\"\nStiles looks at him: relieved, confused, unsure.\nDerek says, \"The first thing I ever said to you was, 'This is private property.'\u201c\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles says, voice hoarse, \u201cI remember.\u201d\nDerek says, \u201cThis is real.\"\nStiles echoes, \"This is real.\"\nDerek tilts his head forward, touching their foreheads together. They stay that way, eyes closed, just breathing for a long time, until Scott says, \"What the hell is going on?\"\n\nStiles is watching a dumb commercial selling an ugly necklace when he sits up suddenly, spine stiff. He asks, \"How did we meet?\"\n\n\n\"What?\" Derek asks, \"What do you mean? We-\" But he stops. He doesn't have an answer.\n\n\nStiles says, \"You can't remember either.\"\n\n\nDerek can remember lots of things, but some things are hazy, indistinct.\n\n\nStiles asks, \"How did your parents die?\" Derek shakes his head, mind blank. \"Laura? I don't think you ever told me.\" \n\n\nDerek can feel their absence like an open, aching wound, but the answer doesn't come. \n\n\nStiles says, \"I remember my mom dying but I don't remember sophomore year of high school. Honestly, most of high school. Did I go to graduation? Were you there?\" \n\n\nStiles turns off the TV, stands up, and walks to the kitchen, not meeting Derek\u2019s eyes. Derek follows him, grabs his arm, makes him turn and look at Derek.\n\n\nDerek asks, \"What\u2019s going on?\"\n\n\nStiles squirms out his grasp, moves behind the kitchen island, away. He says, \"Something is very wrong here. Tell me you feel it, too.\u201d\n\nTwenty minutes ago, Derek wasn't thinking about much more than getting a couple steaks out of the freezer to thaw, but now.\n\nDerek nods.\n\n\nStiles slumps forward onto the butcher block, relieved.\n\nStiles is seventeen. Seventeen.\n(They just celebrated Stiles\u2019 twenty-third birthday last week. Derek had gotten him a cake shaped like an X-wing and a birthday balloon with dinosaurs on it. The woman at the store had given him a strange look when he'd said they were for his boyfriend. Stiles had laughed when Derek told him about it after, had said, \u201cOh man, making yourself look like a pedophile is like, half the gift, it's perfect.\u201d)\nMelissa McCall doesn\u2019t like or trust Derek, likes and trusts him less now that she\u2019s pulled him off of a twin bed with a teenage boy. Any other nurse would have called the cops, Derek is grateful she just kicked him out of the room.\n\u201cI get that you\u2019ve been through a traumatic experience together,\u201d she says, \u201cBut you have to understand how it looks to people who don\u2019t know the, um, the circumstances.\u201d\nDerek looks down the hospital hallway, away.\nMs. McCall pushes a strand of hair off of her forehead and blows out a deep breath. She says, \u201cYou need to remember that he\u2019s still just a kid, ok?\u201d\nMs. McCall looks at him and it\u2019s the same hard, wary expression he gets from Scott all the damn time.\n\u201cIt won\u2019t happen again,\u201d Derek says.\n\n(Stiles says, \"Honey, I'm home.\" He does that a lot; it stopped being cute years ago. Derek hasn't told him, yet.\n\n\nDerek says, \"We're having frozen pizza, I don't feel like cooking.\"\n\n\n\"Sounds good to me,\" Stiles says. He comes up behind Derek, plants a noisy kiss on the back of his neck. He drops Derek's house keys onto the counter, to the right of where Derek's wrestling a frozen pizza out of the plastic wrap.\n\n\nStiles says, \"Left those in the door again. Someday an axe murderer is just gonna waltz in here and kill us all.\"\n\n\nStiles reaches over, grabs a frozen pepperoni off the pizza.\n\n\n\"Don't do that,\" Derek says. Stiles smiles, unapologetic.)\n\nDerek is standing in the hall, awkward, avoiding Scott and the sheriff and the hospital staff, when Boyd arrives with a cup of bad coffee and a newspaper.\nOn some level, Derek remembers the fight that landed them here, but it was a long time ago. The details are fuzzy. He doesn\u2019t know what happened after Stiles lost consciousness, after Derek followed.\n\"You went down, Erica ripped the witch\u2019s throat out, but neither of you would wake up,\" Boyd says, \"We didn't know what to do. Deaton said to bring you here.\"\n\"It's ok,\" Derek says, \"You did the right thing.\"\n\"It's been three months,\" Boyd says. He taps the dateline on the newspaper as proof.\nDerek's face feels scratchy when he runs his hand over it, but he doesn't have a beard. They'd shaved Peter regularly, the nurses at Beacon\u2019s Crossing. Cut his hair. It was standard practice for residents. Derek had always thought it was creepy, but he appreciates it now.\n\n(Stiles pumps his fist in the air, nearly knocking his laptop off the arm of the couch. He says, \u201cHa! You\u2019re so totally wrong, he slipped and hit his head during a snow-storm. He didn\u2019t die of a heart attack. I was right, you were wrong.\u201d\n\n\nDerek says, \u201cFine. You win.\u201d\n\n\nStiles says, \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing you\u2019re pretty.\u201d)\n\nStiles glances up at him, scratching at the Band-Aid on the back of his hand. He says, \u201cI heard you ripped yourself out like Neo in the Matrix.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Derek says. Whatever Isaac told him is probably more impressive than how it actually happened.\nStiles rolls his eyes, says, \u201cAlways gotta be the badass.\u201d\nStiles' hair isn\u2019t long, but it\u2019s longer than he usually keeps it. Derek can\u2019t stop looking at it, it looks wrong.\n\"The nurses, uh, thought it was cute like this. I don't like it,\" Stiles says, tugging on a lock behind his ear.\nDerek says, \"I can-\" He stops himself. He forgot that he doesn't own clippers.\nStiles exhales noisily, says, \"Jesus Christ this is weird. This is so fucked up.\"\nIt really is. Derek wants, badly, to reach out and touch Stiles, something that was second nature yesterday, and now seems wildly inappropriate.\n\"I don't know what to do with you,\u201d Stiles says, \u201cYou're both, you know, the guy who tried to kill Lydia and the guy who put me on his Costco membership.\"\nDerek breathes, tries not to think too hard about anything. \u201cIt was a spell,\u201d he says, \"It wasn't real.\"\n\"You think I don't know that?\" Stiles says, \"Fuck, I still have to finish high school.\"\n(Stiles had been ecstatic after he'd gotten his bachelor's degree, spent hours bouncing on his heels, and shouting \"Magna cum laude, bitches!\" at anyone who would listen. When Derek had said, \u201cWell someone in this family had to be good at something,\u201d Stiles had leered at him, said, \u201cYou're good at lots of things.\" Then he'd thrown up on Derek's shoes.)\nDerek says, \"You were valedictorian last time, you'll do fine.\"\nStiles half-smiles. \"Great,\" he says, \"Now I have to live up to myself.\"\n\n(Derek says, \u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n\n\nStiles says, \u201cWhen it comes to nondeterminism, I promise I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about, either.\u201d Stiles rolls his eyes, gestures to the book on his lap. \u201cBut I have to get at least an 87 on this test.\u201d\n\n\nIf he gets straight As this semester, he gets new tires for the jeep. The sheriff\u2019s idea. It\u2019s been a surprisingly effective motivator.\n\n\n\u201cOk,\u201d Derek says, \u201cThen tell me again about the-\u201d Derek looks down at the chicken-scratch notes in his hand, says, \u201cThe Cook-Levin theorem.\u201d)\n\nMs. McCall comes back through on her rounds. She doesn\u2019t look surprised to find Derek there, just sighs and takes Stiles\u2019 vitals down on a piece of paper.\nStiles looks up at her nervously, says, \u201cCan we walk around? I don\u2019t want to get, like, deep vein thrombosis.\u201d\nMs. McCall rolls her eyes and says, \u201cFine, but if the doctor sees you out of bed, it was your idea.\u201d\nStiles takes his first few steps like Bambi on the ice, but he gets better at it quickly. He\u2019s always been stronger than he looks.\n\u201cI used to think, like, all the time, \u2018How did I get so lucky?\u2019\u201d Stiles says after a while, looking anywhere but at Derek directly. \u201cI didn't think the answer would be evil witches.\"\nDerek says, \"No one expects evil witches.\" His tone is off; it's not really funny anyway.\n\"You\u2019re the best thing that ever happened to me,\u201d Stiles says, suddenly.\nDerek says, \"I'm not-\"\nStiles waits for him to finish, but Derek isn\u2019t sure what he\u2019s trying to say. Stiles isn\u2019t talking about Derek \u2013 not the Derek Hale who\u2019s walking through the long term care ward of Beacon Hills General, the alpha of the Hale pack. The person he\u2019s talking about wasn\u2019t a werewolf, hadn\u2019t spent the majority of his adult life making the wrong decision.\nDerek says, \"I'm not the best thing that happened to anyone.\"\nStiles is looking at him, calculating. He says, \"No, I guess not.\"\n\"They weren't-\" Derek starts, doesn't know how to finish, ends up muttering, \"We're not them.\"\n\"Yeah,\" Stiles says. Derek knows that voice; usually he'd reach out, pull Stiles in. But. Seventeen. Nothing about this makes any God damn sense.\n\"Maybe we should try to\u2026 forget,\" Derek says, \u201cWe should forget.\u201d\nStiles stop walking, looks down, scuffs his toe against the hospital linoleum, and Derek has lost any right he once had to try and interpret that gesture.\n\u201cProbably,\u201d Stiles says.\n\n(Stiles does a thing a lot where he switches words or just says the wrong one. Month instead of year, tiger instead of lion, foot instead of shoe; small things. Derek doesn\u2019t usually notice, but Stiles gets frustrated and some things make it worse: stress, caffeine, lack of sleep.\n\n\nIt takes him four tries to get through an explanation of the build problems they\u2019ve been seeing at work and finally he gives up and says, \u201cFuck it, it doesn\u2019t matter anyway.\u201d He mumbles to himself, \u201cI hate my stupid broken brain.\u201d\n\n\nDerek wasn\u2019t really paying attention, but he says, \u201cI like your broken brain.\u201d Stiles isn\u2019t always coherent, but he\u2019s never boring. Derek likes that, always has, he thought Stiles knew that.\n\n\nStiles goes 100% still, mouth hanging open. He says, \u201cYou-\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI what?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNothing, never mind,\u201d he says, but his face is flushed, cheeks pink. It was obviously something.)\n\nThey run a battery of tests on Derek, on Stiles. Cognition. Blood work. Urinalysis. The doctors didn't know what was wrong with them before, they don't know what's right with them now.\nHalf the town comes by at one point or another: Derek's pack, most of the Sheriff's department, Lydia, the entire high school lacrosse team. An endless parade of people who were worried, who bring flowers and casseroles.\nStiles looks at Scott, asks, \"Allison?\"\n\"She's home with strep,\" Scott says, \"I've been over there, like, a bunch of times, but we thought it wouldn't be a good idea for her to come here.\"\nStiles makes a sympathetic face, says, \"I had that a couple years ago, it sucked.\"\n(Stiles was miserable the whole time he was sick. He didn't like being alone, but his skin was over-sensitive and he didn't want Derek touching him either. Derek had spent a week saying, \"It'll get better, you should get some rest, I'll bring you more ginger ale,\" and carefully not laying his hand on Stiles face, his shoulder, the back of his neck. It had been hard on both of them.)\nScott looks confused. He says, \"You've never had strep throat.\"\nStiles won't meet Derek's eyes. \"You're right,\" he says, \"Ignore me, I don't know what I was thinking.\"\n\n(\u201cHow have you never had a cold before?\u201d Stiles asks, shaking out the thermometer.\u00a0 \u201cHow is that possible?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Derek says.\u00a0 His voice sounds weird.\u00a0 He says, \u201cI just don\u2019t remember ever having one as a kid.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Stiles says, \u201cI\u2019ll make you chicken noodle soup.\u00a0 Family recipe.\u00a0 Family recipe plus kale, kale is good for you, we should eat more kale.\u201d)\n\nThe hospital discharges them in the morning, Stiles looks at Derek like he wants to say something the whole time, but he lets his father pack him quietly into the back of a patrol car.\nErica picks Derek up in a Lexus SUV that he doesn't recognize.\nShe asks, \"Did you miss me?\"\n(They hadn't lived completely in a bubble; they'd had friends. Stiles did Geeks Who Drink Wednesday nights, Derek went to happy hours with coworkers, but they\u2019d lived cut off from Stiles' high school friends, Derek's pack. Stiles had remembered Lydia a little, Scott a little less. Anyone that would have made them remember or see the wrongness of the situation had been edited out, surgically removed. In order to miss her, Derek would have had to have been aware of her existence. He missed her, anyway.)\n\"Yes,\" he says.\n\"Good,\" she says, \"Because I missed the shit out of you.\" She pops her gum and smirks and Derek is glad to be awake, for once.\n\u201cYou\u2019re smiling,\u201d she says, \u201cIt\u2019s freaking me out.\u201d\n\u201cGet used to it,\u201d Derek says, scowling.\nErica laughs, says, \u201cNow that\u2019s the alpha I know.\u201d\n\n(Derek says, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to \u2013 you say it every time. It\u2019s like you think you have to.\u201d\n\n\n\"I don't know,\" Stiles says, \"It's a habit.\"\n\n\nDerek says, \"It's a weird habit.\"\n\n\"Fine. It's a weird habit. You've got me,\u201d Stiles says. He shrugs. \u201cBut I yelled at my mom before I left the hospital once and I woke up in the middle of the night terrified it would be the last thing I ever said to her. I made my dad drive me back at like  three A.M.  so I could see her. What If I get hit by a bus? What if the last thing I ever said to you was, I don\u2019t know, \u2018pick up some more ice?\u2019 That would fucking suck, man.\")\nDerek has an apartment, comes home to a neat stack of grocery circulars, junk mail, water and electric bills all marked 'PAID' in Boyd\u2019s neat, blocky penmanship. His plants have been watered and the basil on the kitchen sink is getting big enough that it should probably be re-potted.\n(Stiles couldn\u2019t keep a cactus alive. Derek had to travel for a month-long work project in Lakewood, Florida and when he came back Stiles looked guilty and said, \u201cPlease tell me you didn\u2019t have a lot of emotional attachment to that rubber plant.\u201d)\nHe doesn\u2019t go into the bedroom because he knows that it\u2019ll be clean, tidy: no crumpled receipts on the nightstand, no ancient, ugly afghan draped haphazardly on the bed, no pile of dirty laundry shoved into the corner.\nHe falls asleep on the couch.\n\n\"I don't think anything is real,\" Stiles says.\n\n\nDerek wants to think he's crazy, it'd be easier to understand that way.\n\n\nDerek says, \"You seem pretty real to me.\"\n\n\nStiles smiles, picks up Derek's hand and presses a small kiss against Derek's knuckles.\n\n\n\"Yeah,\" he says, \"But everything else\u2026\"\n\n\nDerek says, \"Yeah.\"\n\n\nHe spent all day watching his coworkers. They never did a single unexpected thing. It was like watching a video on repeat. A loop.\n\nStiles shows up on his doorstep the next day, backpack slung over one shoulder. He says, \u201cCan I come in?\u201d\nIt's a bad idea.\nDerek shrugs, says, \u201cKnock yourself out.\u201d\nStiles helps himself to a bottle of mineral water from the fridge.\n\u201cWhat you doin\u2019?\u201d he asks.\nDerek says, \u201cPeter thinks it\u2019s a good idea if we set up a file server.\u201d What he\u2019d actually said was something about putting his supernatural reference materials in 'the cloud;' it had made Derek\u2019s eye twitch.\nStiles stares over Derek's shoulder at the command prompt while Derek types. Derek can't understand why Stiles is interested, it's boring even to Derek.\n\"Before,\" Stiles says, \"I would never have guessed you knew Linux.\"\nDerek sighs, pushes a hand through his hair in frustration. He says, \"I don't know where you got this idea where I've been living in the woods my whole life. I went to-\"\n\"CUNY, I know, I remember. I was listening,\" Stiles says.\n(Derek's CIS degree was an old argument, no, not an argument. More like a running joke. Stiles said, \"Have you tried turning it off and on again?\" in a British accent a lot. Stiles thought he was hot shit because he had a 'real' CS degree, but that just meant that they both got bull-headed and snippy trying to troubleshoot problems with the printer, the router, Stiles' phone: constantly grabbing back and forth, hissing, \"No, no, that's a stupid idea, let me try.\")\nStiles kind of starts laughing, says, \"You hate Macs! Oh God, I thought, you know, you always looked like Peter's laptop was going to bite you - I didn't know it was because of your weird Steve Jobs issues.\"\nDerek rolls his eyes, says, \"I don't have Steve Jobs issues-\"\nStiles is full-on laughing now, silent, his shoulders heaving.\n\"I just don't know what he has against buttons. I can't do everything using a damn spinning wheel,\" Derek finishes. Stiles wipes tears away from the corner of his eyes. His face is red, blotchy, but he looks. Derek hasn't seen him really smile since they woke up.\nStiles says, \"Never fucking change, man.\"\nStiles' heartbeat is fast, tripping over itself, though Derek doesn't understand why. He hitches his backpack strap higher, says, \"Yeah, I'm gonna, um, I'm gonna head out.\"\nAfter he's gone, Derek doesn\u2019t know why he came by in the first place.\n\n(Stiles always does his taxes on April 14th, has filed for an extension twice in the last five years, but Derek likes to get it over with as soon as he gets his W-2s.\n\n\nHe's halfway through itemizing his charitable donations when Stiles sits down too close, makes large gestures opening his laptop, settling into the couch. He types obnoxiously loud and Derek finally looks over at him, exasperated.\n\n\n\u201cWhat the hell are you-\u201d Derek starts, confused. \u201cWhy are you googling \u2018mariachi pants?\u2019\u201d\n\n\nStiles cracks up laughing, bent nearly in half. He says, in short, hiccupy pants, \u201cJust to see your face.\u201d\n\n\nDerek rolls his eyes, shoves Stiles off the couch.)\n\nStiles comes by again the next day, too. He says, \u201cCan I hang out here? Scott and Allison are doing a thing.\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d Derek says. He shouldn\u2019t be encouraging this, but he doesn\u2019t actually want Stiles to leave.\nFor a long time they don\u2019t even talk. Stiles does his homework, fucks around on Derek\u2019s wi-fi while Derek watches college football. Penn State beats Illinois; it\u2019s not a very interesting game.\nDerek switches off the TV and when the silence gets uncomfortable, Stiles says, \u201cIt's weird being a virgin again.\u201d This is something Derek has actively tried not to think about. \u201cOr, I mean, I don't think it counts - I'm not unsullied. I've been sullied. Thoroughly.\"\n\"Stiles,\" Derek says, in the tone of voice where Stiles is synonymous with stop.\n\"Ok and this is the part where you say it wasn't real. Let's skip it, I'm tired,\u201d Stiles says, waves his hand between them. \u201cDo you remember who won the World Series in 2013? I could put a bet on it now, like in Back to the Future II.\"\nDerek sighs. He says, \u201cWe didn\u2019t time travel, it doesn\u2019t work like that.\u201d\nThe oven timer goes off, a reminder he set earlier, before Stiles came over. He was supposed to do something.\nStiles says, \"Laundry.\u201d\nDerek looks at Stiles, confused, and Stiles says, \"It's Saturday.\" He shrugs.\nDerek, yeah, he has to go down to the basement, move his clothes into the drier. He never remembers, once left a load of t-shirts in a washing machine long enough that they started to smell sour.\nStiles says, \u201cDon\u2019t forget a drier sheet. And quarters! They\u2019re in the closet by the door.\u201d\n(The Mets won the World Series in 2013. They won it every year. He should have taken that as a sign; the Mets are terrible.)\n\n(\u201cI thought you had it,\u201d Stiles says.\n\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. You always remind me to grab it and you didn\u2019t this time, so I forgot,\u201d Derek says.\n\n\n\u201cHow are you making this my fault?\u201d Stiles asks. He looks sideways at Derek, disbelieving, angry. He says, \u201cIt\u2019s in no way my fault that you have a shitty memory.\u201d\n\n\nDerek says, \u201cYou\u2019re better in the mornings than I am, we both know that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI have bad days sometimes, I was up too late last night, I thought you\u2019d remember.\u201d\n\n\nDerek says, \u201cIt\u2019s not important, I don\u2019t want to fight about this.\u201d\n\n\nStiles looks like he has more to say, but he lets it go. It\u2019s fine.)\n\nDerek doesn\u2019t check who it is when there\u2019s a knock on the door. Stiles doesn\u2019t bother to ask permission to come inside, says instead, \"Mrs. Mayes from downstairs was our sub in Econ today. I almost hugged her. It was awful.\"\nDerek knows logically that the witch built what she did from their combined subconscious, but it's unnerving when he runs into people he recognizes \u2013 Anthony from work; Mona, Stiles' friend from his trivia team; Jose the remarkably nosy pharmacist. They're not the people Derek knows; she just borrowed their faces, their voices, how they walked.\nDerek says, \"It will get easier.\"\nStiles quirks an eyebrow at him, says, \"You sure about that?\"\nIt has to.\n\"You could always move after you graduate,\u201d Derek says, \u201cSomewhere you haven\u2019t been before.\u201d\n\"Did she make up Chez Panisse?\" Stiles asks, \"Or is it gonna really be there?\"\nDerek clears his throat. \"It's real. I ate there a long time ago.\"\nStiles pumps a fist in the air. He says, \"See? You can go home again.\"\n(They went there a few times \u2013 Derek\u2019s promotion, Stiles\u2019 graduation, after Mona had the baby \u2013 it was too expensive to make a habit of it, but Stiles had liked it. Talked about it. They met Alice Waters at a book signing once and Stiles almost knocked over a display of decorative teacups.)\nStiles says, quietly, \"I only applied to Berkeley.\"\nScott is going to the local community college, Isaac too. Erica applied to UCLA, Riverside, Davis, most of California and Boyd's going where she's going. Jackson and Lydia are taking their melodrama to the east coast and Derek will be glad to see the back of them, honestly. Derek didn\u2019t want to ask what Stiles\u2019 plans were.\n\"What?\" Stiles says, indignant under Derek\u2019s scrutiny. He says, \"I already know my way around the campus.\"\nDerek doesn't say what a bad idea it is. It's not like Stiles listens to him anyway.\n\n(Stiles shoves a couple files into a backpack, pours coffee into a travel mug, and says to himself, \"I love my job. I love my job. I love my-\"\n\n\nDerek glares and mutters, \"You could try loving it less.\"\n\n\nStiles makes a pinched face but doesn't say anything. They have this fight all the time, he knows how Derek feels.\n\nStiles perches on the arm of the couch, Derek attempts to be very invested in the NFL pregame show he's nominally watching. The 49ers are going to be good this year, apparently. They drafted that running back from  Cal , Derek had liked watching him play last year.\n\n\"We can try that place you were talking about tonight,\u201d Stiles says, and Derek can tell he\u2019s stalling, he won\u2019t leave if Derek is actively mad at him. \u201cUm. The one with the Vietnamese sandwiches?\u201d\n\n\n\"Sure,\" Derek says. He turns away from the TV, those guys are idiots anyway. He says, \"Go on, go, it\u2019s fine. Try not to stay too late.\"\n\n\nStiles brightens. He says, \"Text me if Kaepernick throws an interception - I have the Seahawks\u2019 defense.\" He smiles and kisses Derek goodbye and says, \"I love you,\" and leaves.\n\n\nThe 49ers win easily, 31-10. The Seahawks' defense sucks.)\n\nDerek isn\u2019t thinking, answers the door shirtless \u2013 he\u2019d been doing pull-ups, sweating \u2013 and he\u2019s overwhelmed by the smell of Stiles, the strong odor of want.\n(They'd had - Stiles called it married sex. Derek went to bed early most nights, Stiles worked all hours and came home tired. It wasn't urgent or all the time - not like when Stiles was nineteen and wanted to try everything twice.)\nStiles, seventeen-year-old Stiles smells eager, ready, good-to-go every time he's around Derek. The rest of the pack politely ignores it, but it's harder for Derek. Before, he'd had dulled, human senses. He only knew Stiles wanted him because Stiles told him, curved his body into Derek's hands. He doesn't do that now, but it's worse this way, hearing his heart beating fast, catching his scent on Isaac's lacrosse uniform.\nStiles looks embarrassed, says, \"I'm sorry. You look, I mean, you know what you look like.\" He doesn\u2019t ask to come inside.\n\n(\u201cIs that your-\u201d Anthony asks.\n\n\nDerek looks up, Stiles is parallel parked outside of the bar, sitting against the hood of the jeep, kicking his feet. He looks twelve, not twenty.\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Derek says.\n\n\nAnthony says, \u201cI pictured something different.\u201d Derek glances over at him. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that\u2019s a bad thing.\u201d\n\n\nStiles always says he\u2019s unconventionally handsome, that it\u2019s his winning personality that brings all the boys to the yard, but Derek just sees Stiles.\n\n\n\u201cHey drunky,\u201d Stiles calls out and Anthony cracks up laughing. Stiles asks, \u201cNeed a ride?\u201d)\n\nStiles turns eighteen and Derek isn\u2019t very surprised when he shows up drunk at Derek\u2019s door.\n\"So,\" Stiles says, \"So this is kind of bullshit. I'm in love with you. Why are you pretending it didn't happen?\"\n(Stiles smells like lime juice and tequila. He smells like the trip they took to Mexico in December of 2016, the one where Derek got food poisoning and Stiles called him a dumbass for ordering ceviche in the first place.)\n\"Because it didn't,\" Derek says. It's pretty much that simple. \"You're not in love with me.\"\nStiles was in love with a normal guy, a sysadmin at a medium-sized tech company who spent too much time on Reddit. That guy had never hurt anyone, never had blood or ash or graveyard dirt on his hands.\nDerek says, \"You have to let him go.\"\u00a0 He says, \u201cGo home, Stiles.\u201d\nThe look Stiles gives him is familiar: angry and stubborn. He says, \"Fine.\"\n\n(\u201cYou order stupid mixed drinks all the time,\u201d Derek says.\n\n\nStiles rolls his eyes, says, \u201cI have like, one every three months.\u201d\n\n\nDerek frowns, that doesn\u2019t sound right. \u201cYou used to have them all the time,\u201d he says, \u201cYou have them every time we go out.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI have them when we go to nice places,\u201d Stiles says, \u201cWhich we don\u2019t do anymore. Remember when you used to try and impress me?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNever happened.\u201d\n\n\nStiles smiles, leans into him, laughs, the corners of his eyes crinkling, slightly. He takes a sip of his drink \u2013 Wild Turkey on the rocks, nothing Derek can make fun of \u2013 and raises an eyebrow in challenge.\n\n\nDerek\u2019s breath catches in his throat; he has to look away.)\n\n\u201cThis is really good,\u201d Erica says, \u201cWhere\u2019d you get the recipe?\u201d\nDerek looks down at his hands, away from her.\nErica swallows loudly, says, \u201cNever mind.\u201d\n(Contrary to popular belief, Derek did cook.\u00a0 He grilled a couple bison steaks every Wednesday, roasted Brussels sprouts and sweet potatoes.\u00a0 He just didn\u2019t like to make the elaborate, twelve-ingredient, soak overnight kind of recipes Stiles liked.)\nIsaac helps with the dishes, and then Boyd and Isaac leave. Boyd\u2019s shift at the ice rink starts at seven, Isaac has plans that make him shy, embarrassed. Erica hangs back, puts her hand inside the crook of Derek\u2019s elbow to make him stand still.\n\u201cHe's not like, seeing anybody,\" Erica says, \"He doesn't even flirt.\" She sounds disappointed.\nDerek says, \"Why are you telling me this.\"\nErica says, \"Don't you miss him?\"\n\"I see him all the time.\"\nShe looks at him, pitying.\nWhen he chose her it was in part because she'd seemed mature, older than her years. Strong. Determined. Things that make her a good werewolf, a good friend, make her unpredictable and stubborn. He should have picked someone dumber, easier to control. But that's what Peter had thought about Scott and look where that got him.\nShe says, \"You know him. You know he'll wait forever.\"\n\"He's waiting for someone that doesn't exist.\"\nErica says, \"No, dumbass, he's waiting for you.\"\nSame thing.\n\nIt almost doesn't matter if Derek thinks something's wrong too. He knows that once Stiles gets an idea in his head, he's going to run with it until he runs out of road. Derek can tell already that Stiles' mind is made up, so either Derek goes with him or Stiles goes it alone and Derek can't let that happen.\n\n\n\"I haven't seen a good movie since the last Batman,\" Stiles says, \"I mean that. I haven't seen a movie in years that I didn't think, 'I could have written that myself.'\"\n\n\nDerek nods. Fashion trends haven't changed much. Food trucks are popular. People at work still talk about craft beer, mixology. All the trivial shit that Derek never bothered to pay attention to, to care about, it hasn't changed. He keeps upgrading the servers at work to new versions of Red Hat, Weblogic, Java, but there hasn't been a new breakthrough tech since Twitter. The more Derek picks at the seams, the more it starts to unravel.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a dream,\u201d Stiles says, \"We need to wake up.\"\n\n\nThey could stay. It's not terrible here.\n\n\n\"Yes,\" Derek says, \"I think we do.\"\n\n\nStiles says, \"I have an idea.\" He says, \"I think-\"\n\n\nDerek interrupts, says, \"I've seen Inception. I can see where this is going.\"\n\n\nStiles hiccups a sick laugh, says, \"Please don't remind me about your thing for Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Oh God.\"\n\nWhen Derek is hit with unexpected memories at odd times, it's always the good things. The first time Stiles got really, really drunk on whiskey cocktails and they\u2019d fucked, uninhibited, Stiles pulling his hair so hard it hurt. Leaving a catered, black-tie event and Stiles saying, \"Damn, I'm hungry, want to get Wendy's?\" Sprinting through the bitter fucking cold, laughing, to get to the library right before they locked the doors, Stiles' sad eyes charming the student assistant into letting them in.\nBut it wasn't perfect. They fought, sometimes. Derek hated Stiles' job, how much time it took, how they didn't respect him there. Derek got sick of being the only who ever put gas in the car, got the tires rotated, the oil changed. Stiles didn't like that Derek's wasn't better at saying important things; said, more than once, \"You make me feel like I'm alone in this,\" and Derek never knew what to do when he got like that, usually he didn't say anything, just felt angry and helpless.\n\nDerek doesn't ask where the gun came from. Probably Stiles' dad, probably without permission. Illegal firearms possession is, at this point, the least of their problems.\n\n\nStiles says, \"Dude, you're way too fucking zen about this.\"\n\n\n\"Don't call me dude,\" Derek says, automatic. He says, \"I feel like this isn't that bad, that we've seen worse. Don't you?\u201d\n\n\n\"Yeah,\" Stiles says, \"And that's what's freaking me out.\" Stiles looks pensive. He says, \"What if we're, I don't know, serial killers. Mass murders. Slobodan Milosevic. Worse. Do we want to know?\"\n\n\nDerek says, \"You're not a mass murderer, Stiles. You break for rabbits.\"\n\nStiles snorts, rolls his eyes. He says, \"What if we don't know each other? What if we don't like each other? We've got a good thing going here.\"\n\nThis is the part in the movie where the hero says, \"I\u2019ll find you,\" or, \"Every me loves every you, no matter what.\" Derek doesn't say anything. Stiles knows how he feels about him.\n\n\nStiles stares down at the gun for a while, looks up at Derek over the kitchen island.\n\n\"Why does this feel so damn familiar?\" He asks, eyes wide. Scared. \"Maybe we shouldn't do this, if this is the kind of thing we're used to.\"\n\nDerek asks, \"Do you want to spend the rest of your life not knowing what's real?\"\n\n\nStiles shakes his head. He says, \"Ok. Ok. I'll do it. I'll do it.\"\n\n\nStiles picks up the gun and stares at it. It looks heavy, large in his inexpert grip. Derek is grateful he volunteered.\n\n\nStiles looks up, meets Derek's eyes.\n\n\n\"Look, honestly, I don't think I can do this,\" he says. Derek lays one hand against his chest, high up where his collarbone meets the start of his neck. \n\n\nDerek says, \"Yes, you can.\"\n\nStiles is strong enough for the both of them. Derek knows this, even though he knows nothing else, anymore.\n\n\"I'll be right there,\u201d Stiles says, \u201cI love you.\"\n\n\nDerek wakes up.\n\nDerek comes out of the bathroom and Stiles is sitting on the couch, staring down at his hands. He wasn\u2019t there when Derek went into the bathroom, usually he calls or knocks on the door; he\u2019s never just let himself in.\n\"What are you-\"\nStiles says, \"You left your keys in the door.\"\n\"I - what?\"\nStiles holds up his hand, Derek's house-keys dangling, hooked around his middle finger. The keychain is a Chinese fish, Erica's idea, bright orange and blue. She'd said, \"Maybe if you can see it from space you won't forget so much.\" But it hadn't worked. Obviously.\n\"You did it all the time. It used to drive me crazy. I came here because, you know what, I don't remember. It doesn't matter. We weren't different people. I saw your keys and I thought, 'Ugh, again? He's gonna get us killed.' Just like I did when you did it last month.\"\nStiles sighs, runs a hand over his newly-buzzed hair.\nHe says again, \"We weren't different people.\"\nWhatever restraint has been keeping him calm, quiet snaps.\n\"And this,\" he says, jumping to his feet and grabbing an empty bottle off the counter. \"The recycling bin is literally two feet away. It's actually more work to put it in the wrong place, but you do it anyway!\"\nDerek really doesn't know what's happening right now.\n\"You lectured me all the time about putting my shit away, but I was always the one who hung up your jacket so you'd find it in the morning. I bet you can never remember where you left it anymore.\" Stiles chucks the bottle into the bin and throws his hands up. Derek can see his leather jacket where he threw it over a chair last night. He'd spent 10 minutes looking for it yesterday before finding it in the backseat of the Camaro.\n\"Stiles, what are you-\"\nStiles makes an impatient noise, lurches forward and kisses Derek. How they got from Stiles enumerating Derek's shitty habits to this? Derek is lost. But, Jesus, Stiles. He can't help but kiss back, it's almost automatic.\n\"See?\" Stiles says, lips brushing against Derek's mouth as he talks, \"You do that the same, too.\"\n\"What are you-\u201d Derek starts, cuts off, frustrated, confused. He says, \u201cStiles, we talked about this. It wasn't real.\"\n\"The situation wasn't real,\" Stiles clarifies. He looks really meaningfully into Derek's eyes before pressing Derek's keys into his hands. \"The people we were when we were in that situation? That was real. That was us. And I was thinking, you know, if the bad things about you are still exactly the same, if the shit that drove me crazy is 100% pure, unadulterated Derek fucking Hale, then why not the good stuff, too?\"\nDerek says, \"I\u2019m not-\"\n\u201cYes, you are,\u201d Stiles says. He sounds so sure about it. \u201cI know you.\u201d\nDerek looks down at their hands joined over the stupid-bright fish keychain.\n\"Oh,\" he says.\n\"Yeah, oh,\" Stiles says, mocking, but he's smiling. \"You are such a fucking dumbass, but I have a wealth of compelling evidence that you and me could be really good together. Wanna give it a shot?\"\nDerek is getting really sick of looking for his keys, his jacket. He's getting really sick of not finding Stiles where he's supposed to be, either.\nDerek says, \u201cSure.\u201d"
