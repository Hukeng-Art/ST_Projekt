    "text": "The day that everything changes starts out a lot like every other day of that January. They\u2019re edging into the last year of the curse and Jackson still shows no sign of being less of a tremendous scaly douchecastle; it\u2019s snowing.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be ceramic forever,\u201d Stiles tells Scott mournfully as he oversees the preparation of Jackson\u2019s breakfast. It\u2019s been his catchphrase for the last two years, as the denizens of the castle have watched the petals fall off of the rose in the west wing and still the gates remain locked and not a single viable candidate for True Love has stopped in to stay for a long weekend.\n\u201cYou keep saying that,\u201d Scott says irritably. \u201cDude, I know, okay?\u201d\nStiles hops over to where Greenberg is frying eggs in an extremely surly fashion; he always flips them a hair too late, unless Stiles reminds him, and then Jackson yells for hours about how his egg-white omelet is singed along the edge. Stiles isn\u2019t really sure where his ears even are, anymore, so his options for plugging them during one of Jackson\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m surrounded by incompetence and ugliness and everything in my life is pain\u201d screaming fits are severely limited. \u201cFlip,\u201d he orders Greenberg.\n\u201cNo, but, seriously,\u201d Scott says, \u201cthe roses are still blooming.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s impossible,\u201d Stiles says dismissively. \u201cWe may be in northern California but even here roses don\u2019t bloom in January. It\u2019s snowing, Scott.\u201d\nScott frantically waves one of his candlesticks towards the huge windows facing the back gardens. \u201cLook!\u201d he shouts, pointing with a guttering flame. \u201cRoses!\u201d\nMuttering to himself and checking the internal temperature of his tea, Stiles spins on his base and looks out of the bay windows. They\u2019re kept pristine mainly by virtue of Finstock being psychotically focused on cleaning schedules, and Stiles has a moment to appreciate that at least some people didn\u2019t respond to the curse by locking themselves in a wing of the house and destroying all of their antique\u2014and hugely expensive\u2014furniture before he realizes, huh, Scott\u2019s actually right, for once.\n\u201cWhoa,\u201d he says involuntarily.\nScott preens. \u201cI know! Do you even know how he does that?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles admits. \u201cThe trade secrets of the gardening staff have never really been my forte.\u201d He gestures his spout back towards the stove. \u201cObviously.\u201d Clustered around the base of the fountain and gazebo complex that Jackson\u2019s mother had insisted on before bailing, along with the rest of his useless family, at the sight of her hideous monster of a son, are a series of rosebushes that are basically exploding flowers into the open air. A light dusting of snow covers the top of them, like confectioner\u2019s sugar on the apple cake that Stiles sometimes makes for tea.\nThey\u2019re actually the loveliest sight Stiles has experienced in a long time. There\u2019s something intensely warming\u2014and it\u2019s not just his tea\u2014about the explosion of red and pink and orange and yellow in the marble white deadness of the back garden.\n\u201cDerek,\u201d Stiles willingly declares, \u201cis scarily good.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe he made a deal with the witch,\u201d Scott says thoughtfully.\nStiles laughs, spitting tea towards the stove. \u201cYeah, because he asked for magical gardening skills instead of being turned back into a human.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know!\u201d Scott insists. \u201cHe\u2019s weird. He might\u2019ve.\u201d\n\u201cAren\u2019t you responsible for the entire downstairs staff? Go check on the silver. Every time I turn around I see Matt sticking a piece of the dinner service into one of his hidden drawers.\u201d Stiles prods Scott with his handle. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get back to supervising breakfast.\u201d\n\u201cMatt is scary,\u201d Scott whines, but he nonetheless hops off of the kitchen counter and skips towards the door. The flames from his candles flutter at the motion, guttering in and out with the force of Scott\u2019s propulsion. He\u2019s not really that fantastic a candelabra, all things considered\u2014and by \u2018all things\u2019 Stiles means \u2018twenty years\u2019 worth of jokes about Scott not being the brightest bulb on the Christmas tree\u2019\u2014but he takes his duties as the lower butler fairly seriously, at least. Well, when Stiles reminds him.\n\u201cBreakfast rolls out in ten,\u201d Stiles shouts, rounding on the contents of the stove. \u201cGreenberg, seriously? I turn my back for five seconds and you\u2019re burning the spinach. I can\u2019t even begin to know how.\u201d\nBreakfast gets out on time by sheer force of will, and Stiles consigns Greenberg and the other pans to the stove for a thorough washing while he goes to check on how the rest of the downstairs is doing. Finstock and his flock of mops are hard at work in the main foyer, scrubbing up nonexistent dirt like nobody\u2019s business, and Stiles is moving into the library to check on the French dusters when there\u2019s a series of frantic knocks on the front door.\nStiles freezes mid-jump and his lid jangles nervously. \u201cDid you\u2014hear that?\u201d he asks the nearest mop.\n\u201cHoly fucking shit,\u201d the mop breathes, which is clearly a yes.\n\u201cOH GOD,\u201d Stiles shouts helplessly. \u201cOPERATION ALPHA, EVERYONE.\u201d\nThe mops scatter in all directions; Finstock and the bucket throw themselves into an open closet that used to hold Mrs. Whittemore\u2019s collection of shoes, before she took them all with her in a separate car during her ignominious flight from the castle grounds. This leaves Stiles alone in the foyer, and there\u2019s no way that anyone is going to think that a teapot in the middle of a gazillion acres of marble floor isn\u2019t weird; Stiles skids in a patch of leftover soapy water as he races forth sheltering fronds of a nearby potted palm.\nTen achingly long seconds later, the front door creaks open. \u201cHello?\u201d the man in the door calls out. \u201cJesus, Helen, this place is completely empty.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d the woman behind him says snippily, \u201cthat I can\u2019t predict the emptiness of a house based on the way it looks a half-mile away.\u201d\nTo the potted palm, Stiles quietly comments, \u201cNeither of them seem particularly like True Love material, do they?\u201d The palm isn\u2019t one of the members of the household staff, so it doesn\u2019t answer. \u201cWell. Fuck.\u201d\n\u201cHello?\u201d the man shouts, slightly louder now. \u201cWe had some car trouble and both our cells died. Can we use your phone to call AAA?\u201d\nThere\u2019s no response; Stiles realizes that his lid is clicking nervously and he forces it to stop. Marta isn\u2019t connected to outside lines anymore\u2014one of the specifications of the curse is no indirect access to the outside world, like they\u2019re somehow going to whip a loophole out of thin air using their combined Google-fu\u2014but she hates being picked up and she\u2019ll probably rip them a new one if they try.\nNormal people are probably not used to talking phones.\nStiles slumps over, resting his spout against the palm\u2019s pot. He can see a possible solution to the curse slipping away in front of his eyes\u2014he\u2019s never going to be human again, and one day his porcelain is going to disintegrate from lack of care and he\u2019s going to be dust particles, which frankly sounds disgusting\u2014when there\u2019s a low, throbbing hiss from the top of the stairs.\n\u201cShit,\u201d Stiles says to the potted palm, surprisingly calm considering what he knows is about to happen.\nJust as predicted, the front door slams shut behind the couple\u2014who are bickering about whose fault it is that they lack a working cell phone between them\u2014under the force of Jackson\u2019s leap from Danny, the main chandelier. Clinging to the wood paneling with dripping claws, he snarls at the couple and his forked tongue slithers out from between his lips.\nThe man faints; the woman shrieks, whips a can of pepper spray from her purse, and tries to nail Jackson in the face with it. She\u2019s not quite fast enough; Jackson hits the back of her neck with his venom and she collapses like her strings have been cut, the can of pepper spray falling out of her limp hand to roll across the marble floor.\n\u201cWas that really necessary?\u201d Stiles demands, crawling out from his hiding place.\nJackson\u2019s tongue flicks out and touches his left eyeball; it\u2019s one of the most magnificently unattractive things Stiles has ever seen, and he\u2019s been a fat teapot in a castle full of reflective surfaces for almost ten years.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to let them leave so they can call the police,\u201d Jackson says bitchily.\n\u201cWell, what are you planning on doing with them, genius?\u201d Stiles demands. \u201cNow you\u2019ve got two unconscious people in your foyer and their car somewhere a half-mile away. And they\u2019ve seen that a fucking big reptile lives here.\u201d\nFinstock ducks his bristles out of the front closet. \u201cAre you going to kill them?\u201d he asks, a bloodthirsty interest soaking the question.\n\u201cNo!\u201d Stiles shouts at the same time that Jackson says, \u201cMaybe.\u201d\nStiles gives him a dirty look. \u201cNo,\u201d he repeats. \u201cWe don\u2019t kill people here! That is the opposite of a good plan, Jackson.\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you figure out what to do with them, then?\u201d Jackson suggests. He promptly climbs up the nearest tapestry and flings himself at Danny; three seconds later, his tail is disappearing around the corner of the staircase that leads to his lair in the west wing.\n\u201cEverything sucks and is awful,\u201d Stiles tells the universe at large, hopping closer so he can get a better look at their new guests. Both of them are wearing clothing that screams INCREDIBLE EXPENSE WENT INTO MY PURCHASE and he\u2019s fairly certain that the man\u2019s undershirt has been tailored. They\u2019re so the type of people that will be missed.\n\u201cI guess we could fake a car accident,\u201d Stiles observes with a palpable lack of enthusiasm.\n\u201cSounds like a plan, Bilinski,\u201d Finstock says. The bucket\u2014Maribel?\u2014begins to back away, presumably so that Finstock\u2019s murderous impulses don\u2019t put her in his line of fire. The housemaids were underappreciated and generally interchangeable even before the curse took hold; Stiles can\u2019t tell any of them apart now that he can\u2019t guess based on hair color.\nSometimes, Stiles misses the ability to rub his temples more than anything; he can feel a major headache looming on the horizon, and he doesn\u2019t even have the ability to radiate irritation. \u201cWe aren\u2019t killing anyone,\u201d he says to the ceiling. \u201cSend someone to get Derek and we\u2019ll lock them in the dungeons until I can come up with a better idea than murder.\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d Finstock huffs, actually upset that they aren\u2019t going to be killing their unexpected houseguests, and he sweeps out of the foyer towards the conservatory off of the main parlor, which is the fastest way to get to the gardener\u2019s shed where Derek and the rest of the Hales spend the majority of their time.\nStiles puts on his thinking cap as he bounces around the perimeter of the collapsed bodies, waiting in case the man decides to wake up. Stiles hasn\u2019t had to take on a human in ten years, but worse comes to worse he can just shoot boiling tea at his face. Unfortunately, three rounds later Stiles still has no idea what to do with them and he\u2019s kind of tired of moving. He nudges his spout into the woman\u2019s fallen purse, looking for any kind of wallet.\nAccording to her ID, her name is Helen Martin, and she\u2019s a well-preserved 47-year-old from Beacon Hills, which is the closest town to the castle outside of the boundaries of the Preserve. In addition to her wallet, her purse also has a dead cell phone. Stiles assumes the slim brick thing is a cell phone, at least\u2014he hasn't seen one in ten years, but the only other stuff in her purse is a bunch of tampons and a bag with a scary amount of black-cased, professional-grade make-up.\n\u201cWhat, Stiles?\u201d Derek asks in tones of long sufferance as he and his sister appear from the main parlor.\n\u201cI did nothing,\u201d Stiles states immediately, out of habit, and then he scowls at Laura, who laughs. \u201cShut up, both of you! This is 100% the work of Jackson Whittemore, asshole prince of the night.\u201d He tilts his lid in the direction of the slumped bodies. \u201cI was thinking we should stash them in the dungeons until we figure out how to handle this.\u201d\n\u201cEach time Jackson overreacts to a situation I think it\u2019s going to be the top of the list, worst thing ever,\u201d Laura remarks as she leaps off of Derek and comes over to look at the couple, \u201cbut then he surprises me with how deep his dickishness really goes.\u201d She flips over and nudges the woman with her handle. \u201cUgh, they\u2019re all floppy.\u201d\n\u201cCan you guys move them?\u201d Stiles asks. \u201cI ask because, um, weak and tragically small, here.\u201d He gestures to the body of his pot with his spout. \u201cWe need to get them locked up before the venom wears off. Or this one wakes up, I guess.\u201d\n\u201cFainters,\u201d Laura huffs dismissively. She tucks her base under the man\u2019s shoulders and heaves, dragging him towards where Derek is tilted towards the ground. \u201cC\u2019mon, baby bro, let\u2019s help the damsel in distress.\u201d\nStiles has basically left himself wide open for that one, but he still weakly protests, \u201cI\u2019m not a damsel, exactly.\u201d\n\u201cThe tea service, then,\u201d Laura modifies; her mouth is under the man\u2019s jacket, but Stiles can hear her shit-eating grin loud and clear.\nDerek accepts both of the bodies without a single groan, and Stiles sits wedged into the crook of the man\u2019s arm as they navigate the stairs down to the basement. The dungeons aren\u2019t part of the normal cleaning schedule because dirt and cobwebs are thematic necessities, but all of the locks are polished and oiled once a month\u2014just in case.\n\u201cDump them in the cleanest one,\u201d Stiles advises, and he and Laura critically analyze which cell appears to have the fewest number of eight-legged inhabitants before picking randomly between the two that have mattress padding not infested by rats. Derek silently tilts the couple onto the packed-dirt floor and wheels backwards out of the room.\n\u201cHave a nice stay!\u201d Stiles calls out to them as Laura pushes the door shut and the locks slide smoothly into place. The woman replies with a muffled groan; her husband (?) is still unconscious, which: wimp, clearly.\nAs Derek, Stiles, and Laura stare at the woodwork of the door, Stiles finally lets himself say, faintly, \u201cThis is either going to end very well or with all of us locked in a government warehouse in Reno and Jackson at Area 51.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit,\u201d Laura says cheerfully. \u201cIn you go, Stiles,\u201d she continues, and she scoops him up and dumps him into Derek, who responds with a muffled noise of surprise as Stiles skids across the bottom of his tray.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Stiles remembers to ask when they\u2019re halfway up the stairs. \u201cDid you make those roses bloom? The ones in the back gardens by the kitchen? Because Scott\u2019s under the impression that you, like, sold your soul to that hackneyed bitch Gerard Argent for the ability to make plants bloom whenever you want.\u201d\n\u201cScott is an idiot,\u201d Derek replies.\nStiles rolls his eyes. \u201cYes, thanks for that thrilling and unexpected update on my best friend, but seriously\u2014was it you?\u201d\nAfter a long pause, as Laura cackles silently to Stiles\u2019 left, Derek says, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cOh man, that is so freaking cool,\u201d Stiles enthuses, and Derek\u2019s wheel misses the next step and almost sends the three of them backwards into the basement. \u201cWhoa!\u201d Stiles shouts. \u201cYou okay? These stairs aren\u2019t crumbling, are they? Shit, we can\u2019t stash prisoners in a basement with a staircase about to go, I\u2019m pretty sure that's in violation of the Geneva Convention.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fairly certain kidnapping is a felony,\u201d Laura points out, and since she\u2019s right, Stiles just swallows down the guilty lump in his throat and nestles himself further into the front corner of Derek\u2019s tray, which seems the corner least likely to spit him out if Derek stumbles again.\n\n~\nStiles has the kitchen staff make a lot of sandwiches and then he puts them on a tray in the fridge and sends four of them down every six hours along with a pitcher of water and some of the less talkative glasses. He has Finstock supervise and hopes that the watching goes in both directions; Finstock will keep the soft-hearted cutlery from offering to let the humans out, and the cutlery will keep Finstock from murdering the couple out of\u2014well, out of whatever bizarre reasoning Finstock uses to guide his decision-making process.\nTwo days later, when Stiles still has no idea what the hell to do with their, um, guests, there\u2019s another knock on the front door. Stiles is in the kitchen this time, staring at the pile of produce that had been outside of his cabinet when he\u2019d woken up this morning, but he finds out fast enough when Scott skids into the door breathlessly and shouts, \u201cTHERE\u2019S A GIRL IN THE CASTLE,\u201d and promptly brains himself on one of the casserole dishes.\n\u201cDude,\u201d Isaac says in a deeply betrayed voice. \u201cThat kind of majorly hurt.\u201d\n\u201cOH MY GOD,\u201d Scott shouts. \u201cA GIRL. IN. THE. CASTLE.\u201d He rubs one of his tapers against his forehead, pressing out where he\u2019d been slightly dented from one of Isaac\u2019s handles, and in the interim there comes a high-pitched squeal from the foyer.\nStiles throws himself off the counter, leaving Greenberg to his own devices while the zucchini finish saut\u00e9ing, and lands in a clatter of his delicate parts. He hops like he\u2019s never hopped before and makes it into the foyer with most of the parlor furniture, where the source of the squealing turns out to be Finstock, who\u2019s being firmly gripped\u2014in a distinctly not fun-looking way\u2014by probably the most beautiful girl Stiles has ever seen in his life, and Mrs. Whittemore had left her Limoges prints up in the breakfast room when she\u2019d left.\n\u201cI don\u2019t recall imbibing any hallucinogens,\u201d the girl says in a terrifying logical way, \u201cand I was fine while I was driving, so it appears that this castle is filled with living furniture.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not furniture,\u201d Stiles barks, and great: he\u2019s now officially a barking teapot. He\u2019s a Harry Potter character.\nThe girl waggles Finstock, says, \u201cI\u2019m disinterested in semantics,\u201d and drops him. \u201cHowever, I\u2019m pleased to note that my mother\u2019s purse is on your hall table.\u201d\nRachel guiltily tries to scuttle away, but the girl has scarily fast reflexes; she darts over and snatches the burgundy leather bag before Rachel has a chance to break for the billiards room. \u201cWhere are my parents?\u201d she demands, shaking the bag at Stiles.\nStiles opens his mouth and snaps it shut a second later as Scott\u2019s gleeful shout echoes in his head. THERE\u2019S A GIRL IN THE CASTLE. Oh. Shit.\n\u201cLock the doors!\u201d Finstock bellows and there\u2019s a stampede as a set of wardrobes from the second floor guest bedrooms race to be the first; the girl looks confused for a second, and then astonished, and then furious. But by then, the wardrobes are blocking the doors and her only option is to throw herself\u2026out of one of the fourteen other exits to the outdoors that exist on this floor alone.\n\u201cThis was poorly conceived,\u201d Stiles informs the entirety of the foyer. \u201cThere\u2019s no way that she\u2019s going to agree to just stay on her own now that she knows you\u2019re all psychotic.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d the girl demands, and that\u2019s naturally, when there\u2019s a hysterical hiss from the upstairs banister.\n\u201cNO, JACKSON,\u201d Stiles, Scott, and Isaac yell in unison, but he\u2019s already hanging from Danny by his tail, swinging back and forth like a murderous Cirque du Solei performer, dripping paralytic toxins all over the newly-cleaned floors.\nJackson rudely demands, \u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d and the girl, who looks like she can\u2019t decide whether to be terrified or furious, settles for a (still incredibly attractive) combination of the two.\n\u201cWho am I?\u201d she echoes. \u201cWho are you? And where the hell are my parents?\u201d\nIf you\u2019d asked Stiles twenty minutes ago if Jackson could be termed \u2018clever,\u2019 Stiles would\u2019ve laughed himself sick and spilled half of his tea everywhere as he rolled around the floor of the kitchen\u2014but ten minutes later, the girl has agreed to stay as long as Jackson releases her parents, and Derek and Laura are being dispatched to collect the couple from the dungeons.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re going to be able to hold me,\u201d the girl\u2014Lydia\u2014comments with her nose firmly in the air as her parents scramble the get themselves out of the door as fast as possible; their lack of interest in the fate of their daughter says a lot of worrying things about their relationship. \u201cI\u2019m smarter than all of you.\u201d\n\u201cProbably true,\u201d Stiles admits. \u201cHowever, we\u2019re desperate and there are way more of us. So I guess it\u2019s kind of a draw.\u201d He wants to say something like, Jackson is kind of stupidly hot when he\u2019s not a lizard, so you should fall in love with him and break the curse so we won\u2019t be appliances for the rest of our lives, but he\u2019s not allowed to talk about how pretty Jackson is, re: Gerard Argent\u2019s curse guidelines.\nAs Lydia follows Scott up the main staircase to the room in the east wing that will be hers for the duration of her stay\u2014God knows how long that will be; Stiles doesn\u2019t plan to hold his breath about her sticking around for breakfast, although he\u2019ll be prepared with cinnamon and brandy French toast if she is\u2014Stiles finds himself wedged into a corner with Derek as the rest of the household staff gossips furiously.\n\u201cWhat do you reckon?\u201d he asks Derek, nudging him companionably with his handle. \u201cTwenty-four hours? Tops?\u201d\n\u201cTwelve,\u201d Derek says darkly. \u201cLet\u2019s not kid ourselves.\u201d\n\n~\nLydia is at breakfast. She eats Stiles\u2019 French toast delicately and makes a surprised noise when she takes the first bite. Stiles knows that he\u2019s a great cook\u2014for one thing, Jackson still eats his food even though he should probably prefer living rodents, considering his biology\u2014but the soft moan that Lydia makes around her fork is so gratifying that Stiles hovers a few inches off of the ground all day. His lid rattles every time he speaks, but he can\u2019t really help it.\nStiles spends the afternoon planning the evening menu with the kitchen staff, including Greenberg, who sleeps through it and spares the rest of them his idiocy. Through the bay windows, Stiles can see Derek and the other Hales hard at work in the back gardens. Peter is rather cheerfully sniping at deadhead roses, the blades of his shears reflecting the sun in a way that\u2019s slightly frightening, and in the background Derek is a steady presence, towing his family members and bags of mulch and burlap sacks of bulbs to and fro.\nProduce is still showing up in absurd quantities outside of Stiles\u2019 cupboard at night. Since only Jackson, and now Lydia, actually consume food, Stiles has more zucchinis than he could conceivably use to feed a crowd of biblical proportions. But they\u2019re all fantastic examples of their vegetative kin\u2014symmetrical squash; plump, ripe berries; bundles of fresh herbs, ready for drying or spicing or garnish\u2014and Stiles wants to cook like he hasn\u2019t been able to in years, not since the majority of the castle was human and Mr. and Mrs. Whittemore were still around.\n\u201cI was thinking a simple five course?\u201d Stiles suggests, flipping to the section of his recipe notebook entitled FOOD FOR LOVE. \u201cNot too much pressure, but enough to encourage conversation and romantic lighting and such.\u201d\n\u201cAre you sure that\u2019s a good idea?\u201d Isaac asks.\n\u201cWhat, dim lighting?\u201d Stiles laughs. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d Isaac says. \u201cConversation. Jackson doesn\u2019t really know how to talk to someone without sounding like a pretentious asshat.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a long pause as everyone at the kitchen table digests this.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Stiles finally says, \u201cyes. That\u2019s very true. But she\u2019s got to fall in love with him and since I can\u2019t exactly cut out Jackson\u2019s tongue, I just have to hope my food is good enough to seduce her into a better frame of mind.\u201d Even as the words come out of Stiles\u2019 mouth he\u2019s aware of them being complete and utter bullshit, but his delusions are all he has now, and he keeps them close. It\u2019s not like anything else keeps him warm at night; the china cabinet is fucking freezing.\n\n~\nEvery night, as Stiles and his flock of tea cups bring Lydia her nightly tea, Lydia manages to work into the conversation at least once that she likely won\u2019t be around come morning. After two months, the threat becomes a bit stale, but Stiles honestly has no idea what\u2019s holding her back. Jackson is still surly, uncommunicative, and awful, and Stiles isn\u2019t arrogant enough to think that his cooking is actually capable of tying her to the castle.\nHe manages by the skin of his teeth not to ask Lydia outright, but when he goes to sit on the bench outside of the kitchen windows and look at the roses that are still stubbornly blooming, he spills his thoughts to Derek, who works at the vegetable patch with a single-minded devotion that\u2019s fairly staggering.\n\u201cI\u2019m wondering,\u201d Stiles tells him on a Thursday, \u201cif maybe she\u2019s waiting until the curse is set and then she\u2019s going to skin Jackson, turn him into a pair of shoes, and take over the castle herself. That seems like the kind of thing she might do.\u201d\n\u201cYou sound excited,\u201d Derek says. He seems more silent than usual, which Stiles hadn\u2019t been aware was an achievable state without actually being mute.\nStiles shrugs. \u201cOne master\u2019s kind of like another, you know? And it\u2019s not like Jackson has earned any kind of devotion. He\u2019s a shit-head and it\u2019s his stupid fault that we\u2019re even stuck here. If he hasn\u2019t called Kate Argent ugly, I could still have working arms right now.\u201d\n\u201cJackson could\u2019ve been Mary fucking Poppins and Gerard still would\u2019ve cursed us,\u201d Derek says. The way that he says it\u2014namely, forcefully\u2014tells Stiles that he knows what he\u2019s talking about. Stiles hadn\u2019t been aware that Derek had known either of the Argents; but then again, Stiles hadn\u2019t even known Derek when they were still human. As far as he\u2019d been concerned, the produce that the kitchen had used was a gift from benign gardening fairies.\nStiles shrugs again, more laconically this time. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to hate Jackson, who lives here with us and still refuses to use the goddamn stairs, than Gerard Argent. God knows where he is. Hopefully rotting in hell.\u201d\nDerek says, \u201cAmen,\u201d which is hilarious.\n\u201cI hope he gets one of those fates like Sisyphus,\u201d Stiles says dreamily, leaning back against a vine of ivy clinging to the back of the wrought iron bench on which he\u2019s perched. \u201cLike, thousands of splinters in all of the tender areas of his body. Or maybe he\u2019s filled up with tea and he keeps on having to pour it out and pour it out and he\u2019s still full.\u201d\n\u201cOr maybe,\u201d Derek says quietly in a queerly pained voice, \u201che\u2019s surrounded by things that he needs and he can\u2019t have them.\u201d\n\u201cThe gods already did that to Tantalus,\u201d Stiles points out, deciding to ignore the whole bits of that sentence that have BAD FEELINGS written all over them, \u201cbut A+ on the revenge scheme. I\u2019m personally pulling for the scenario where his bodily organs are continually set on fire while still inside his body.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Derek agrees. \u201cI like that one.\u201d\n\n~\nIn the middle of April it begins to rain and then it won\u2019t fucking stop. Lydia had basically moved into the library on day two of her stay, but even she looks like she\u2019s beginning to climb the walls from frustration. Day four of \u201cWe don\u2019t live in Seattle but you sure couldn\u2019t tell from the meteorological data,\u201d Erica shows Lydia where Mrs. Whittemore stashed her extensive nail polish collection, and Lydia spends long hours trying different color combinations until the whole upstairs reeks of acetone.\nJackson bitches; Lydia says, sweetly, \u201cOh, can you smell? Your lack of nose had made that unclear,\u201d and Jackson shoves a spoonful of Stiles\u2019 spring onion soup into his mouth, mumbling something unintelligible as a comeback.\nThe staff does their best to encourage romance. In addition to Stiles steadily moving through his FOOD OF LOVE recipes, Finstock blackmails Harris into playing bittersweet piano concertos so that the notes drift down the hall from the music room. Derek and Laura leave vases of roses and daylilies in all of the rooms in which Lydia spends time; the library takes on a sweet, honeysuckle smell. Derek always leaves a few cuttings for Stiles from the rosebushes that are still\u2014still; Stiles is beginning to seriously contemplate the \u201cDerek sold his soul to the devil to be the best gardener in the state\u201d Scott McCall hypothesis\u2014blooming.\nStiles appreciates that Derek is enough of a creeper to know how much rosewater goes into Stiles\u2019 romantic recipes, but frankly Stiles is running out of ways to use the roses. Eventually he gives up and just asks one of the vases in the window over the sink to hold them; the next time Derek stops in with a delivery of cream from the dairy in the barn, he looks as close to beaming as Derek can get without breaking his face.\nIt\u2019s kind of an oh fucking shit moment, for Stiles.\n\n~\nStiles was barely equipped to deal with his emotions even before he was turned into a delicate example of Rouen soft-paste porcelain, so he does what comes naturally to him and talks, as loudly and obtrusively as possible, whenever he and Derek are in the same room. He talks to Laura about the history of the glass perfume bottle; he talks to Scott about their fantasy lacrosse teams, which they take great joy in making up stats about since they never hear about the real scores; and he talks a lot at Danny, who is so long-suffering about Jackson continually hanging on him instead of using the stairs that he\u2019s probably going straight to heaven after this farce of an existence is all over.\nHe does not, however, talk to Derek, except in a falsely bright voice in an awkwardly high register; and even then, it\u2019s about what the kitchen needs from the gardens.\nStiles watches himself do it, and he watches Derek dim against the contrast of Lydia burning brighter and brighter as time passes and something grows between her and Jackson that\u2019s inexplicable and disturbing but also real, and Stiles basically hates himself and everything he does, but he\u2019s also incapable of stopping.\nIf Stiles does something spectacularly human like fall in love, he wants to fall in love as a human, with another human, instead of us as teapot with a wheelbarrow. There are whole books and books of wrong with the latter scenario; it wakes Stiles up in the middle of the night, his tea running cold, at the thought of being stuck forever at the mercy of Gerard Argent\u2019s biting sense of humor.\nStiles has never actually tried to get drunk as a teapot, but in the middle of August he has a TO HELL WITH EVERYTHING kind of day wherein Isaac and Scott are cozying up in the bay window of the main parlor, Scott managing through sheer luck and Isaac\u2019s occasional intervention not to set any of the drapery on fire, and he asks one of the brandy decanters in the library to pour some of its contents into his pot.\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d the decanter asks, hiccupping. \u201cKinda\u2014rich stuff, here.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Stiles says irritably, \u201cthat would be the point, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d and the decanter cheerfully tips over, sloshing brandy into Stiles\u2019 tea.\nThe effect is shockingly quick; Stiles barely makes it off of the sideboard before he\u2019s weaving on his base, his spout knocking at pieces of furniture. \u201cSrry,\u201d Stile apologizes blurrily, and the furniture grins and moves out of his way. He doesn\u2019t want to go to the kitchen because he spends way, way too much time there already, so he goes and finds a dark corner of the library and settles down on a shelf that doesn\u2019t provide a single glimpse of any of the gardens.\nHe tries to brood, but it turns out Stiles is short of hugely shitty at brooding and he\u2019s a very sleepy drunk; he nods off and jerks away two hours later, still drunk but a little less debilitating, to the sight of Lydia\u2019s face hovering in front of him. \u201cBAH,\u201d Stiles shouts, and nearly topples off of the shelf.\n\u201cAre you seriously drunk right now?\u201d Lydia asks, and Stiles considers nodding before deciding that he doesn\u2019t want to do something embarrassing like spurt tea all down the front of Lydia\u2019s nice dress; besides, she\u2019s a smart girl, she knows the answer to her question.\n\u201cYesh,\u201d Stiles tells her, because he\u2019s polite.\nLydia settles back on her heels and laughs so hard that she hits her head on one of the shelves and has to recover. \u201cThe sheer incompetence of everyone here is astonishing,\u201d she remarks quietly, but affection lies heavily over her words.\n\u201cAre you going to stay?\u201d Stiles asks her. \u201cWe like you a lot and you\u2019re a goddess and Jackson\u2019s like 0.12% nicer when you\u2019re around because he wants to impress you.\u201d\n\u201cI know that,\u201d Lydia says, flicking a lock of hair over her shoulder. \u201cYou have to make boys like Jackson work for it, or else they get lazy and complacent.\u201d\n\u201cJackson\u2019s like the opposite of lazy,\u201d Stiles observes, resting his handle against a bookend so he won\u2019t get vertigo and tumble to the ground. Finding out what will happen if he shatters isn\u2019t on his agenda for today. \u201cHe\u2019s got a very strict schedule. Always broods from 11:30 to 1:30 and takes lunch at 1:40. I have to steam his broccoli, you know; he won\u2019t take it boiled. Loses too many nutrients.\u201d\nLydia\u2019s eyebrow lifts comically high. \u201cWhat kind of lizard monster is worried about nutrients?\u201d\nStiles thinks, the kind that used to be a prince with an eight-pack and biceps the size of grapefruits, but the curse won\u2019t let him say that. \u201cThe not-lazy kind,\u201d he says instead. \u201cJackson can be very focused on what he wants. Iss, um, goal-orientated.\u201d\nLaughing, Lydia arranges the fall of her skirt over her knee. \u201cOh, I can see that,\u201d she says. \u201cAs flattering as it is to be the goal of a guy who owns a house that\u2019s probably larger than the entirety of Beacon County, I don\u2019t want to play Morticia to his Gomez.\u201d\n\u201cJackson is way too preppy to be Gomez,\u201d Stiles rushes to assure her. \u201cIf anything, you\u2019d be the Jean to his Patrick Bateman.\u201d Stiles frowns. \u201cWait, that\u2019s still wrong. Jackson isn\u2019t a serial killer. He\u2019s a yuppie with a scaly skin problem.\u201d\nLydia says, \u201cI don\u2019t particularly want to be a WASP housewife either, Stiles,\u201d and before Stiles can tell her that he didn\u2019t mean that, either, she stands up, brushes off her skirt, and vanishes back into the stacks, moving too quickly for Stiles to follow.\n\n~\nCome September, things are fairly bleak. The rose is on its last petal; Jackson has stopped socializing and spends all of his time with Danny close to the plaster molding; the roses in the back garden are beginning to slow their reckless propulsion of blooms. The mood in the castle is one of desperation tinged with resigned despair; there\u2019s no way that they\u2019re going to find another girl to fall in love with Jackson in the next two months, and Lydia looks more and more irritated each time she has to be dragged out of the library to join Jackson for dinner.\nStiles hasn\u2019t seen Derek in two weeks. That\u2019s mostly his own damn fault.\nOn the fall equinox, Stiles comes to the page entitled \u201cLast Fucking Resort\u201d in his FOOD FOR LOVE recipe collection. He manfully girds his non-existent loins and hops out into the garden, which is filled with frenzied harvesting of the last of the season\u2019s produce before the cold snaps set in with a vengeance. The back garden is filled with Hales that aren\u2019t Derek, but once Stiles makes his way along the outside edge of the house to the gardens behind the east wing, he finds Derek and Laura deep in the pumpkin patch, doing something complicated-looking with their uncle the pruning shears.\n\u201cHey!\u201d Stiles calls out. Laura and Peter both politely swivel in his direction; Derek turns in the opposite direction, which is about as pointed as you get can when you\u2019re a wheelbarrow full of baby pumpkins.\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d says Stiles, immediately stricken. \u201cThey\u2019re so cute!\u201d\n\u201cPretty damn adorable,\u201d Laura agrees. \u201cWhat can we do for you, Stiles?\u201d She seems some combination of amused and worried; everyone in the castle has some sort of baseline concern running through them constantly. Stiles operates at a slightly more advanced level of persistent worry, but he generally exists at a more intense plane than most people.\n\u201cI need two very attractive pie pumpkins and four others that\u2019ll be good for stewing but otherwise it doesn\u2019t really matter how they look.\u201d Stiles climbs on top of a nearby pumpkin to get a good look at how the patch is doing. The answer is very well; Derek is the best head gardener that the castle has had in at least three generations, and that\u2019s without even factoring in his wheelbarrow handicap.\n\u201cIt\u2019s done,\u201d says Derek, surly.\n\u201cAnything else?\u201d Laura asks.\nYes, Stiles thinks. Why are my roses dying?\n\u201cNope!\u201d he chirps. \u201cCan you bring the pumpkins to the kitchens by lunch?\u201d\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d Derek mumbles, and he drives off with his collection of baby pumpkins in the general direction of the gardening shed. He can move fairly fast when he wants to; there\u2019s no way, even if Stiles wasn\u2019t a sniveling coward, that he could catch up to him.\n\u201cThis is kind of the opposite of what I wanted,\u201d Stiles says sadly, watching Derek hit a bump and the baby pumpkins become airborne for a handful of seconds. \u201cWhy\u2019s he so mad?\u201d Stiles asks Laura.\nShe sighs and tucks herself underneath a pumpkin, lifting it so Peter can snip at some weedy growth along its base. \u201cDo you really need me to answer that? I thought you were the clever one, Stiles.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m the cleverest,\u201d Stiles agrees. \u201cBut I\u2019m\u2014a teapot! He\u2019s a wheelbarrow!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like that stops Scott and Isaac,\u201d Laura points out. \u201cIf Lydia doesn\u2019t break the curse, we\u2019re going to be stuck like this for either eternity or the rest of our lives, depending on how evil Gerard Argent really is. There\u2019s no point in suppressing how you feel because of some embarrassment about lacking a human body. It\u2019s just hurting everyone, and by everyone I mean you, Derek, and everyone who has to live with Derek because he\u2019s a broody brooder who broods a lot.\u201d\nStiles doesn\u2019t really know what to say to that; for all of his whining, he\u2019s always been sure, in the back of his mind, that the curse will be broken and they\u2019ll manage to become human again. He doesn't want to make life plans based on an outcome where Jackson stays a stupid, angry lizard and Stiles has to pour tea out of his orifices for the rest of his life.\n\u201cNgh,\u201d Stiles says, in lieu of words, and he makes a tactical retreat to the kitchen so he can begin preparations for the Last Fucking Resort meal.\nAll things considered, it\u2019s pretty much the most spectacular thing Stiles has ever crafted. He makes bowls of pumpkin and butternut squash soup with roasted butter and maple syrup, served in hollowed pumpkins. He sends out pecan-encrusted chicken on a bed of linguine as light as air. Dessert is basically a miracle; so much lavender-infused Chantilly cream goes into its creation that the whole kitchen smells like burnt sugar and lavender when Stiles finally has Isaac carry it out.\nScott is technically in charge of romantic atmosphere; nevertheless, Stiles sneaks out of the kitchen and hides in one of the alcoves off of the dining room to supervise, just in case. Scott is in the middle of the table, his candles for once perfectly straight, and Harris has been wheeled into one of the back corners, where he is plonking through the greatest solo piano compositions of Robert Schumann and still, somehow, managing to sound angsty as hell.\nIn the low light from Scott\u2019s candles, Lydia is breathtaking. Jackson is still a butt-ugly lizard monster, but he looks like he\u2019s having a religious experience with Stiles\u2019 trifle, so that\u2019s validating in a weird sort of way.\nOther members of the household staff are squirreled away in alcoves and behind doors and windows; Stiles can see most of them. He can feel the air of the room holding its breath, waiting for the conclusion to an evening that couldn\u2019t have been more perfect if Stiles had forced Jackson to put on a tux and take Lydia to the Rainbow Room.\nPlease, Stiles prays desperately. Please, just tell him you love him. We know. We all know. We don\u2019t really understand, but we know. You just have to say the words.\nLydia swallows a mouthful of cream and comments, \u201cIt\u2019s been eight months.\u201d\nOh shit, Stiles thinks.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Jackson cautiously agrees. \u201cIt has.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve followed your asinine house rules, read most of the contents of your library, and endured dinner with you every night. I think it\u2019s about time for me to get on with my life.\u201d\nShit shit shit shit shit, Stiles thinks.\nThere\u2019s a delicate pause. \u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d Lydia adds sweetly.\nJackson folds his arms across his chest and leans back in his chair. His is not a face made for pouting, but he somehow manages it. \u201cWhatever,\u201d he mumbles, clearly desperately grasping for some kind of equilibrium.\nLydia smirks into her dessert. Stiles is overwhelmed with the desire to strangle her\u2014is she playing a game? Is this some kind of power play? This is their lives, and she\u2019s trying to manipulate Jackson with a set of juvenile headgames?\n\u201cI give up,\u201d Stiles announces, and he leaves as Lydia leans forward and blandly says, \u201cI\u2019m glad we\u2019re in agreement, then.\u201d\nStiles is apparently the only one to have given up hope; the corridors beyond the area directly outside of the dining room are completely deserted. As Stiles hops down a line of Persian runners, his tea bubbles nervously. He tries to reassure himself that he always knew it would come down to this; without his pretty features, Jackson is just an insecure dick-faced weasel, and Lydia Martin is basically perfection given human form.\nWithout conscious input from his brain, Stiles ends up in the back gardens. His rosebushes are limp and sad in the twilight; they\u2019ve lost their vibrancy, sort of like Stiles. Derek is parked underneath the yellow bush, staring into space or glowering or whatever he does to pass the time when he isn\u2019t gardening.\n\u201cMan, fuck this noise,\u201d Stiles says, coming to rest at his side. \u201cLooks like Operation: Last Resort is a bust.\u201d\n\u201cDid you really expect whipped cream to fix everything?\u201d Derek asks in a mean sort of voice.\nStiles nudges Derek\u2019s wheel with his spout. \u201cDon\u2019t be a bitter asshole, okay? I was avoiding you because a fundamental part of me is terrified by the thought of being a teapot in a relationship with a fucking wheelbarrow. But you light up my world or some shit like that and I\u2019m trying to apologize. Or maybe start a conversation that will end up in an apology, I haven\u2019t decided yet.\u201d\nThere stretches out after that a long second of silence, after which Derek deflates and says, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s kind of scary.\u201d\n\u201cDoes this mean you\u2019ll make my roses better?\u201d Stiles asks. \u201cThey\u2019re depressing right now, dude. Look at them.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t call me dude,\u201d Derek says.\n\u201cMan, so not the point,\u201d Stiles replies. \u201cThe point is that your brooding has killed my roses. \u201c\nDerek snorts. \u201cOh, right, your roses.\u201d\n\u201cYes, my roses,\u201d Stiles says, \u201cthey\u2019re so obviously mine that it doesn\u2019t even need to be verbalized,\u201d and he leans over to poke Derek in the wheel again and halfway through the motion there\u2019s this clarion ringing out, like glass being shattered, and a blinding light explodes out of the center of the house and whips past Derek and Stiles and pulses through to the edge of the grounds.\n\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Stiles says, \u201cwhat the ever-loving crap was that?\u201d\nTo his left, Derek says, \u201cI think the spell is broken,\u201d in a shell-shocked voice.\nStiles shakily lifts one of his hands, which is pale but no longer painted with blue vines or capable of pouring tea. \u201cOH MY GOD,\u201d he shrieks, and he turns and flings his arms around Derek, who is about Stiles\u2019 height when they\u2019re sprawled on the ground. \u201cOh my god,\u201d Stiles repeats weakly a second later, as he realizes that Derek is the kind of astonishingly attractive that previously Stiles had only associated with Jackson. \u201cUm,\u201d he says.\nDerek looks just as shocked as Stiles. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2014\u201c he bites out, and then he groans, \u201cShit,\u201d and he and Stiles are frantically kissing because, to Stiles\u2019 everlasting delight, his libido has come back along with his dick and he\u2019s fully capable of appreciating how shockingly hot Derek is, down to a layer of stubble across his sharp jaw and a pair of shoulders that were clearly built by years of hard labor.\n\u201cSex,\u201d Stiles says frantically, tugging at Derek\u2019s flannel work shirt, \u201csex now,\u201d and Derek promptly pushes him backwards onto the dirt and Stiles is so happy to be human that he gives in to nervous, full-body giggles that just melt into laughter as Derek latches his teeth into Stiles\u2019 neck and bites.\n\u201cThe curse is broken,\u201d Stiles whispers happily, and the tendrils of the rose bush above his head unfurl and burst into bloom. \u201cOh man, it was totally the Chantilly cream. Go me.\u201d"
