    "text": "Dean hears the tinkle of the bells on the side door and balances one more set of plugs on the tiny shelf, then closes the glass cabinet and turns.\nGod dammit.\n\u201cHey, man, I\u2019m really sorry, but you\u2019re gonna have to leave your coffee at Gabe\u2019s or drink it there,\u201d he sighs, stripping off his glove and slingshotting it into the trash can. Fucking three-pointer, right there. \u201cFood\u2019s unsanitary, can\u2019t have it in here.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d says his customer, wide-eyed, \u201cmy apologies. I\u2019ll be back shortly, in that case.\u201d Dean has a couple of seconds to take a good look before the door tinkles again and a wave of coffee blows through the usual vaseline-and-disinfectant smell of his shop.\nHe\u2019s got half a mind to just fucking board up that glass door between his side of Physical Graffitea and Gabe\u2019s, but it does bring in a ton of customers, so he won\u2019t. He makes a mental note to bitch at Gabriel to put up more no food/drinks signs on his side, and then his brain turns right back to the guy who\u2019d just walked back into the coffee shop.\nIt\u2019s not like weird people never come in. Weird is good. Dean likes weird people. This guy, though, looked cookie-cutter suburban for all ten seconds that he\u2019d been in \u2013 sensible collared shirt, sensible jeans, sensible fucking wingtip oxfords.\nHe mentally shrugs, pulls out another glove, and opens up the wall cabinet again. There are three more shelves that need to be re-arranged because of last night\u2019s shipment, plus the glass display under the counter. And probably the other wall case, too. It\u2019s Ash\u2019s day off and Jo\u2019s not going to be in until 4, so he can\u2019t shove it all onto her until then.\nHe sighs.\n\u00a0\nTen minutes and a shelf and a half later, the door chimes. Cookie-cutter is back, hands in his pockets, and peering interestedly at a row of bone and horn jewelry.\n\u201cCan I help you out with somethin\u2019?\u201d he asks, because as much as he\u2019d like to keep quietly going about his business, it\u2019s also his business to make business.\n\u201cI\u2019m just admiring the artwork,\u201d the guy answers. Dean tries not to stare, he really does, but there\u2019s something about the clean lines of the way that tucked-in shirt hugs his hips that\u2019s unfairly nice. Dean forces himself to check out the guy\u2019s ears instead \u2013 those are weights he\u2019s looking at \u2013 and realizes that he doesn\u2019t even have a standard 18G ear piercing.\n\u201cAh, that stuff\u2019s meant to be shown off, not sitting in a case,\u201d Dean sighs. It really is. Honestly, he\u2019d be wearing a pair of those catalox filigreed tunnels if he ever decided to not be stingy. And if they weren\u2019t hundred-fifty-dollars-each leftovers from Crowley\u2019s days. He closes the cabinet yet again and walks up to the case, next to cookie-cutter. \u201cThose are mammoth bone, by the way.\u201d\nNever let it be said that he doesn\u2019t like showing off. Just a little bit.\nThe raised eyebrows he gets in response are priceless. He chuckles.\n\u201cYep, those beauties are carved from fossilized mammoth. Over 30 grams each.\u201d\n\u201cSurely that\u2019s too heavy for hanging weights,\u201d murmurs cookie-cutter, and frowns at the jewelry. Dean\u2019s nearly speechless. This guy looks like he\u2019s the type to say \u2018gauges\u2019 instead of \u2018stretched ears\u2019 (or worse, to call the whole shebang barbaric), but apparently, Dean is being much too quick to judge by appearance.\n\u201cNah,\u201d he says, \u201cweights aren\u2019t meant to be worn for a long time, anyways.\u201d\n\u201cVarious cultures would disagree. I apologize if I\u2019m intruding, but are you from Kansas, perhaps? Or southern Nebraska, maybe, or northern Missouri.\u201d\nDean blinks, completely thrown for a loop.\n\u201cI\u2013 why?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re exhibiting the low-back merger, along with some short-a raising,\u201d he rattles off casually, like he\u2019s talking about the weather. \u201cOf course, you\u2019ve also got some significant Texan influence, what with your monophthongalization and vowel breaking.\u201d\nDean stares.\nA full twenty seconds pass.\n\u201cForgive me,\u201d says cookie-cutter with a sigh and tight lips, \u201cI keep forgetting it\u2019s not polite to go without preface. I study dialectology.\u201d\n\u201cDude,\u201d Dean finally says, \u201cI still have absolutely no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\nOkay, yeah, he\u2019s officially being categorized as \u2018weird.\u2019 This is probably the most interesting, weird thing to happen to Dean in a long time and, despite himself, he\u2019s actually intrigued.\n\u201cDialectology is the study of a language\u2019s dialects,\u201d he explains, with a patience that makes it obvious he has to explain this at least three times a week. \u201cI, personally, have taken an interest in dialects of American English, and I can usually guess where someone is from.\u201d\n\u201cJust based on how they talk?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cDamn,\u201d says Dean, grin creeping across his face, \u201cthat\u2019s badass.\u201d He realizes he\u2019s still got a glove on so he pulls it off and walks it to the trash can. \u201cI am, actually, from Kansas,\u201d he continues. \u201cKinda grew up all over, though. Stayed in Dallas for a while.\u201d\n\u201cInteresting,\u201d muses cookie-cutter.\nIt occurs to Dean that he should introduce himself and learn this guy\u2019s name, but the introvert in him hisses like an angry cat at the thought of being social, on top of Gabriel wanting him and Sam to go out to dinner tonight to meet his new-in-town-cousin and socialize. His job might involve brushing elbows with lots of people, but that doesn\u2019t mean he likes them.\nThe side door jangles harshly, making moot his entire train of thought.\n\u201cHeya, Dean-o,\u201d calls Gabriel loudly, Shit-Eating Grin #9 plastered on his face and half a pastry in his hand. Dean slams a fist on the countertop.\n\u201cGabriel, for fu\u2013 for god\u2019s sake, stop bringing food in here!\u201d he snaps. \u201cHow many times do I have to tell you it\u2019s not sanitary?\u201d\n\u201cOh, good,\u201d Gabe says, ignoring him completely and turning inexplicably towards cookie-cutter, \u201cyou\u2019ve met already.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Dean realizes that both of them said it at the same time, which means he\u2019s not the only one confused as fuck.\n\u201cDean,\u201d says Gabriel, and Shit-Eating Grin #9 turns into Cocky Smirk #14, \u201cmeet my baby cousin, Castiel.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nCastiel smoothes down his tie out of habit, takes a short drink of water, and straightens out his cuffs for what feels like the hundredth time.\n\n\u201cLooking nice doesn\u2019t mean you have to wear a tie,\u201d grumbles Gabriel from next to him, sprawled inelegantly as ever in his chair. \u201cI bet you anything, Dean\u2019s gonna drag his ass here in a flannel shirt.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe standard I hold myself to has nothing to do with the standard others hold themselves to,\u201d Castiel replies stiffly.\n\n\u201cHey, Gabe!\u201d booms someone from behind them, and Castiel turns to find arguably the hugest human being he\u2019s ever seen loping towards their table.\n\n\u201cHeya, Sammy,\u201d says Gabriel cheerfully, and nods towards the person borderline sulking behind him. \u201cI see you convinced him to ditch the flannel.\u201d Sam is the younger brother, Castiel remembers, and Dean is the brother he met earlier. Sam makes a face at Dean, who glares right back, then extends his hand.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Sam\u2013\u201d Castiel remembers to shake his hand after Gabriel kicks him under the table. \u201c\u2013and I heard you already know Dean.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, we met,\u201d says Dean, and smiles politely. It\u2019s a little distant, a little plastic, but it still lights up his face and gives Castiel an excuse to take a long look.\n\n\nHe\u2019d already come to the conclusion that sitting across from him is probably one of the most gorgeous people he\u2019s ever seen, but he takes a step back to look at him more objectively. Dean\u2019s grin shows off a lone stud sitting under the middle of his bottom lip (he can\u2019t remember the name for it, but it\u2019s something with a Latinate root, labio, labium, labrum) and a perfect set of cheekbones. The lighting in the restaurant is low so he only catches a short glimpse of long eyelashes and the quick-bright flash of a ring in his nostril and, for a handful of milliseconds, Castiel is transported back to India, back to dim red light filtering through thin cotton, gold jewelry glinting dully through the haze of sweet-sharp incense.\n\n\nThe waiter comes by and they order drinks and appetizers and food; Sam is talking at a mile a minute and the more he talks, the more Gabriel indulges him with witty banter, Castiel notices that Dean relaxes until his smiles are unfiltered and his laughter is genuine.\n\n\nOne hand keeps his notebook open so he can jot down all of the features of the Northern Cities Shift that the waiter exhibits, and he\u2019s halfway through transcribing the waiter\u2019s most recent visit when Dean interrupts him.\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asks, amused and genuinely curious. Castiel holds up a hand in the universal wait gesture, finishes the sentence, and sets down his pen.\n\n\n\u201cIPA transcription, right?\u201d Sam blurts excitedly.\n\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he replies, surprised. \u201cNot a lot of people guess correctly.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what is it?\u201d presses Dean, chin in one hand and leaning forward. Gabriel groans loudly.\n\n\u201cOh, god, don\u2019t get him started,\u201d he complains. \u201cHe\u2019s gonna tell you where you\u2019re from, and he\u2019ll never shut up once he gets going.\u201d Dean shoots him an easy grin.\n\n\u201cYeah, he already did that,\u201d he says, and Castiel makes a soft, bashful noise. Intelligent though he might be, a braggart he is not.\n\n\u201cI told you I study dialectology,\u201d he starts. \u201cIPA is a way of representing every sound with a symbol, a sort of universal phonetic alphabet.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo you write something down, and anyone can read it off and pronounce it correctly.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d says Castiel, surprised again. Very few people catch on this quickly. \u201cI would like to write a dissertation on the Northern Cities Vowel Shift, hence the move here, for graduate work. I\u2019m lucky that Gabriel lives so close to the university.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait, you\u2019re a grad student here?\u201d asks Sam, and he\u2019s so excited that Castiel is worried he\u2019ll shoot off like a rocket. He nods in confirmation. Sam is instantly endearing to him, throwing his emotions wide open for everyone to see. He glares accusingly at Gabriel. \u201cYou never said anything!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou never asked, kiddo,\u201d replies Gabriel with a maddening smirk.\n\n\n\u201cIn any case,\u201d Castiel continues with a furtive glance to check if the waiter\u2019s coming, \u201cI\u2019ve been transcribing what the waiter said. He\u2019s a fairly advanced shifter, and I could use this.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat Cassie means to say is that he\u2019s an eavesdropper,\u201d Gabriel says. Castiel glares at him.\n\n\n\u201cA linguist needs to be able to\u2013\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know, I know,\u201d laughs Gabriel, cutting him off. \u201cDon\u2019t get your panties in a bunch. You guys are coming over for a beer, you know.\u201d He changes topic with a nod at Sam and Dean.\n\n\u201cHell yes,\u201d says Dean loudly, smacking the table with his palm and earning a glare from the old couple a table over. Gabriel sneers at him.\n\n\u201cConvenient, how you\u2019re only social when you know I buy the good beer.\u201d\n\n\nCastiel knows there\u2019s no malice in it and he catches himself chuckling quietly; it\u2019s surprisingly easy to fall back into step with him and, by extension, it\u2019s easy to feel comfortable around Sam and Dean in a way he\u2019s really only ever felt comfortable around Gabriel and Balthazar and Anna. If it\u2019d been glaringly obvious over the phone to what extent Gabriel had taken Sam and Dean under his wing, it\u2019s practically tangible now.\n\nSam is warm and open in a way that\u2019ll attract anyone; Dean is guarded, careful of his emotions and careful in choosing who he\u2019ll open up to. By some miracle, he thinks he\u2019s found himself in that tiny circle. He\u2019s known these men, this family, for less than twenty-four hours but there\u2019s something tugging at him that this is something he shouldn\u2019t let go of, something he can\u2019t afford to let slip. Gabriel values these people to an extent that\u2019s almost absurd and if that\u2019s not a reason to trust them, he doesn\u2019t know what is.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe first thing Dean does at Gabe\u2019s (other than cracking open one of his beers) is to unbutton the top of his shirt. Sam had forced him into what he called a \u2018nicer\u2019 button-up, some dark cottony thing (he doesn\u2019t understand why the nice, soft, worn, plaid flannel had merited an \u2018ugh, Dean\u2019), and he\u2019d bitchfaced until he tucked it in, too. Fancy dinner be damned, Sam\u2019s still getting itching powder for this.\nHe sighs and unbuttons his cuffs, too, as Gabriel bangs around next to him in the fridge and fishes out three more beers. Sam\u2019s voice is carrying from the living room as he motormouths the living shit out of Castiel.\n\u201cDude, I don\u2019t know how much longer your cousin\u2019s gonna be able to deal with Sam,\u201d he grunts, rolling up one of his sleeves.\n\u201cHe\u2019s patient,\u201d Gabe says with a shrug, \u201cand polite. At least Sam shuts up when he drinks.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, thank god,\u201d mutters Dean, and finishes the other sleeve. He follows Gabriel into the living room but misses the couch in favor of helping himself to the sound system. He\u2019s had extra copies of most of his favorite albums here for at least three years, so he sets his beer down on a side table and decides that tonight is a Physical Graffiti sort of night. Ha, ha.\n\u201cYour brother talks a lot.\u201d\nDean nearly drops the side A/B vinyl. Castiel just fucking materializes out of nowhere at his elbow, regarding the sleeve with a regal sort of calmness that his cousin rarely displays.\n\u201cJesus christ, dude, you need to make noise when you walk,\u201d he says, and clears his throat to recover. \u201cYou a Zeppelin fan?\u201d\nCastiel frowns, and Dean\u2019s hopes plummet.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never...\u201d Castiel gestures towards the stereo. Dean sets his jaw.\n\u201cAlright, then you\u2019re about to be educated,\u201d he declares, and lets the album play \u2013 not too loudly, but loud enough. He taps the sleeve as \u2018Custard Pie\u2019 starts rumbling through the speakers. \u201cThis is Physical Graffiti.\u201d Castiel\u2019s frown disappears.\n\u201cOh,\u201d he says, and Dean can practically see the lightbulb. \u201cGraffi-tea. And your shop\u2013 bodily, physical art. Graffiti. Clever.\u201d The first semblance of a grin Dean\u2019s ever seen spreads across Castiel\u2019s face. It\u2019s gorgeous. He chooses to ignore that. \u201cI\u2019m sure it took a good amount of convincing for Gabriel to approve that.\u201d\n\u201cIt was worth it,\u201d Dean says with a shrug. \u201cHe thought it was lame, you know, Physical Graffitea? Who the hell\u2019s gonna come in? Joke\u2019s on him now, though. We get, like, 90% of the coffee-drinking, cafe-food-eating, pierced, tattooed student population through our doors.\u201d\n\u201cHow did you end up working together?\u201d Castiel asks, taking a sip of beer, and Dean definitely does not watch the way his tongue darts out to catch a stray drop on the mouth of the bottle. \u201cGabriel isn\u2019t one for details.\u201d\n\u201cOh, man, it\u2019s kind of a long story.\u201d Dean runs a hand down his face and tugs on his plugs, a habit he never checks that tends to weird people out. Thankfully, Castiel doesn\u2019t seem to care. \u201cI moved out here four years ago. I met Gabe completely by accident, actually. Knew someone who knew someone, that kind of thing. Crowley and Gabe and I were all looking for a new place to start up business, so we figured we might as well do it together.\u201d He takes a long draught of beer and leans against the bookcase. He is so not used to telling this story. Most people just don\u2019t care, they just want their tattoo and breeze out. \u201cSammy started school here a year ago, \u2018bout the same time Crowley went back to the UK.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cLong, complicated, boring story, but that\u2019s basically it.\u201d\nDean shifts his weight. It\u2019s a little unnerving, the amount of staring that Castiel does, because Dean can\u2019t remember the last time someone gave him such absolute focus. Especially when telling some dumb story.\nHe hasn\u2019t even known the guy for twelve hours but Dean can already tell that Castiel is awkward where he\u2019s charismatic, quiet where he\u2019s brash, thoughtful where he\u2019s insensitive, and as clich\u00e8 as the yin-yang thing might be, he could definitely learn to dig this.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLife goes on. Sam starts school in two weeks \u2013 he\u2019s already stressing \u2013 and Dean shamelessly spends nearly every other night with him at Gabe\u2019s, drinking in Castiel\u2019s company.\nThings shift. Castiel starts joining Gabriel when he visits him and Sam, and then sometimes it\u2019s just Castiel, and Dean will keep a constant stream of music going so that everything from early AOR to the peak of hair metal keeps playing softly in the background. Dean has never been more glad that he only lives a block and a half away from Gabriel.\nThe shop gets progressively busier as students trickle back into town for the new school year, and as just-turned-18 freshmen discover that they can do Rebellious Teenager Things like get tattoos and piercings.\n\u201cOh my god, just sleep with him already,\u201d says Jo the Saturday before Sam starts school, completely exasperated.\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Today, of all days, he is not in the mood for dealing with anything. He\u2019d had two complete dumbasses come in for consultations and he\u2019s been booked the whole day, an hour of which was spent with fucking four giggling sorority girls. He\u2019d kicked out the three not being tattooed after the first hour. He\u2019s got five unread texts and a missed call, and his phone chirps yet again from his pocket.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been waxing poetic about him for the past four weeks,\u201d she says stubbornly. \u201cEither sleep with him, or\u2013\u201d\n\u201cGive it a rest, Jo,\u201d he snaps. \u201cI clock out at seven. Seriously, just give me fifteen minutes of goddamn peace.\u201d She sighs and crosses her arms.\n\u201cJust think about it,\u201d she says, more gently this time, and he knows there\u2019s an underlying fine, I give up there. Dean snorts and moves past her into his room. Fifteen minutes is barely enough time to let the autoclave run through everything so he\u2019s definitely going to be going home later than anticipated tonight, and by the time he finishes cleaning and disinfecting, he\u2019s past being in a foul mood and he\u2019s just tired.\n\u201cI\u2019m headin\u2019 home,\u201d he mutters, leaning his elbows on the counter next to Jo and running his hands down his face.\n\u201cGo get some sleep. Or beg some coffee out of Gabe.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d He straightens, pulls Jo into a one-armed hug, and drops a kiss on the top of her head. \u201cDidn\u2019t mean to snap at you.\u201d\n\u201cGo home, Dean,\u201d she laughs, and ducks out from under his arm. The door tinkles. \u201cHey, Castiel.\u201d\n\u201cCoffee, man,\u201d says Dean tiredly. \u201cNot in here.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m in the doorway,\u201d Castiel fires back, deadpan. \u201cI\u2019ve yet to set foot on your premises.\u201d\n\u201cTold you he\u2019d bitch,\u201d says Sam from behind him, all floppy hair and a grin. \u201cGabe\u2019s got coffee for you back there, figured we\u2019d err on the side of caution since you didn\u2019t answer any of Castiel\u2019s texts.\u201d\n\u201cThank christ,\u201d Dean sighs, and pushes past both of them into Gabe\u2019s cafe. \u201cSee ya, Jo.\u201d\n\u201cHey, whoa, Dean\u2013\u201d He can hear Sam scrambling so he turns around, eyebrows up. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna finish eating here, so you\u2019re on your own for dinner.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018Long as you can haul your own asses home,\u201d Dean grunts, and makes a beeline for the paper coffee cup waiting for him in Gabriel\u2019s hand.\n\u00a0\nHe drains the 20oz coffee before he even parks (which is honestly a little impressive, given that the shop\u2019s not even on the other side of the old downtown area), grumbles his way up the stairs, and makes a beeline for the liquor cabinet.\nHe\u2019s a glass and a half into the Hunter\u2019s Helper and sprawled across the couch with The Empire Strikes Back on in the background when Sam opens the door, hauling his bike on his shoulder and talking animatedly to Castiel about something-Latin-something-something.\nDean groans inwardly and stares up at the ceiling. Today of all days, he doesn\u2019t need Sam and Castiel making doe eyes at each other. He\u2019s a mopey little shit and he wants to mope in peace and not think about how Castiel seems to prefer spending time with Sam, how Sam is always around Castiel, how Dean is, in this respect, like in every other, gently pushed to the side.\nHe is very much allowed to be a bitchy teenager after a long day at work.\nSam and Castiel are making the usual racket that accompanies making a place for their bikes in the apartment and he blindly turns up the TV.\n\u201cThat bad of a day, huh?\u201d calls Sam from the kitchen, but his voice is sympathetic. Dean grunts.\n\u201cWhat are you watching?\u201d Castiel asks, leaning on his forearms against the backrest of the couch.\nDead silence.\nArtoo whistles.\nWe\u2019re not going to regroup with the others, answers Luke. We\u2019re going to the Dagobah system.\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d says Sam from the kitchen. Dean\u2019s bolt upright and much closer to Castiel than he\u2019d calculated.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve\u2013 what?\u201d Castiel just looks between him and the TV. \u201cNo. Shut the fuck up and sit down, you\u2019re spending the rest of the night with George Lucas.\u201d\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d Sam mutters again, this time completely exasperated.\nDean\u2019s stuck in the middle of a moral dilemma. By all means, he should be introducing someone to Star Wars starting with the original trilogy, as it should be, but at the same time, those dumb prequels are there for a reason. Unfortunately.\nCastiel parks himself on the couch like he belongs there, which, for some reason, really fucking warms Dean as he\u2019s digging through the DVDs.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to start with Episode I and if anyone asks you, you\u2019re going to tell them you started with A New Hope.\u201d Sam makes a gagging noise from the kitchen. \u201cShut up, Samantha. That goes for you too,\u201d he snaps.\nSam\u2019s still chuckling snarkily as the opening blares and he settles in on the other side of the couch. Dean ignores him; sitting here, on the worn-out couch between Sam and Castiel, is the most comfortable he\u2019s been in a long time.\n\u00a0\nDean\u2019s alarm goes off way too early the next morning \u2013 early, considering the very adult decision he\u2019d made last night to stay up until four in the morning marathoning Star Wars and having more fun being drunk than he\u2019s had in at least a year \u2013 but work is work, and he has to be in before 10 to open.\nHe runs his hands down his face, scrubs at the stubble that\u2019s getting out of hand. Dean\u2019s not entirely sure how he\u2019d managed to shed most of his clothes before passing out but he doesn\u2019t bother putting them back on, ambling across the hall into the bathroom in boxers because clothing just isn\u2019t worth the effort. He feels slightly more human after washing his face and brushing his teeth, which is when he realizes that there\u2019s noise in the kitchen which means breakfast and praise jesus.\n\u201cGoddamn, Sammy, you nev\u2013\u201d\nAnd then he freezes like a deer in fucking headlights because that\u2019s not Sam.\nCastiel is equally as frozen as he is, with a fork in one hand and something sizzling on the stove behind him, but that\u2019s not what matters, what matters is that Dean feels buck fucking naked without a shirt on, without pants on \u2013 not because he\u2019s body-shy (hell no, he knows he\u2019s a fine piece of ass) but because without clothes, Castiel can see his tattoos.\nHe realizes he\u2019s hunching his shoulders up like a freaked-out cat, arching over, and that Castiel is definitely going to take this the wrong way if he doesn\u2019t offer some kind of explanation.\n\nSorry, it\u2019s totally cool that apparently either you broke in or slept here, but you can see my tattoos and that freaks me out. No big.\n\nDean takes a deep breath, pushes his freak-out into his Very Adult Freak-Out Box, and walks up to the stove. Castiel is still staring at him like he\u2019s going to explode at any second, but Castiel is staring at him, at his face. Dean knows exactly what it looks like when someone\u2019s trying to avoid staring at your skin, but this isn\u2019t it. There\u2019s a flood of something warm in his chest.\n\u201cBacon, eggs, and toast? Damn, dude.\u201d He slides a grin towards him. Or, at least, tries to. \u201cIf I paid you, would you do this for me every morning?\u201d\n\u201cThis is a hangover breakfast,\u201d Castiel replies, voice rougher than normal, and now Dean can definitely tell that he looks worse for wear.\n\u201cD\u2019you sleep on the couch or what?\u201d he asks, trying to be casual, because the last thing he remembers from last night was when Sam had called Castiel into his room to double check a something in one of his books or his notes or... something. Castiel hums an affirmative.\n\u201cSam brought out an extra comforter and some pillows.\u201d Dean pulls two plates out of the cabinet (Sam\u2019s not gonna be up until, like, noon), fishes some mostly-dry mugs out of the drying rack, and starts on the coffee.\n\u201cYou know, \u2018mandala\u2019 is a Sanskrit word,\u201d says Castiel carefully. Dean can\u2019t do much more than barely glance at him, meet his eyes for a split second before busying himself with the percolator. He self-consciously tucks in the tattooed elbow in question.\n\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d he answers, and all of a sudden, the tension skyrockets. \u201cTraditional mandalas, they\u2013\u201d He turns around, takes two steps towards the hallway, turns back to face Castiel, then takes half a step back into the kitchen. \u201cI\u2013 okay, just to clarify, I don\u2019t have, like, a no-clothes freakout thing, it\u2019s just that no one\u2019s really seen\u2013\u201d\n\u201cDean, it\u2019s okay,\u201d Castiel says, low and quiet. \u201cI\u2019m intruding. You shouldn\u2019t have to bare your soul to everyone who sees you.\u201d\nWhich, naturally, completely throws Dean for a loop.\n\u201cOh.\u201d\nHe\u2019s never thought of them as his soul. They\u2019re all a part of him -- he can\u2019t imagine life without Vonnegut calmly watching everything from his forearm, without the perfect lines on his side, without the rayed sun-star over his heart that matches Sam\u2019s. He\u2019d never thought of them as his soul, but now that he considers it, it\u2019s completely true.\nAnd here he is, in his kitchen, baring his soul to Castiel.\nAnd it\u2019s okay.\nCas gives him a short, small smile, and piles a fucking mountain of eggs onto a plate.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCas still spends more time talking to Sam, but Dean\u2019s the one who learns more about him. He learns that Cas likes his scrambled eggs with ham and green onion, and that he likes his coffee with half-and-half (which is totally not the reason it starts appearing in the fridge). Cas is a fan of Eastern European fantasy literature and he spent the majority of the last two years between India and Europe; he\u2019s got the majority of some PBS special called Do You Speak American? memorized because he\u2019s seen it so many times. He\u2019s beautifully passionate about language, even though most of their communication is a mug slid across the counter, a movie on in the background, coffee waiting for him after work, extra help grading homework.\nSlushy rain slogs against the windows for what feels like the tenth day in a row; Dean loves this weather way too much, but, as he browses plane ticket prices to John Wayne Airport (and holy shit, an airport named after John Wayne), he thinks it\u2019ll be kinda nice to see what a Californian winter looks like. January is still three months away, but he should\u2019ve gotten this crap done earlier.\nSam murmurs slightly botched Latin from the kitchen and Cas murmurs back in freakin\u2019 perfect Latin, clerical pronunciation, flawless declension. Dean catches every few words, but he knows the quote, anyways.\n\nThough I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.\n\n\u201cYo, Denzel Washington, you know tonight\u2019s your night for dishes, right?\u201d he yells in the general direction of the kitchen. \u201cIt\u2019s almost eleven.\u201d\n\u201cFine, Ellen,\u201d snarks Sam loudly. Cas walks into the living room, chuckling, and hovers over his shoulder.\n\u201cCalifornia?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cBody Arts Expo in January,\u201d Dean says, leaning back in the chair. He doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019s imagining the warmth radiating from Cas or not, but it\u2019s nice, regardless. Cas hums, interested, and he leans over Dean\u2019s shoulder to reach for the mouse when there\u2019s pounding on the front door that sounds like half a Roman army.\nDean gets up, frowning, and checks the peephole before opening the door.\n\u201cJesus christ, Jo, what happened?\u201d he asks after she storms in, eyes brimming and absolutely fucking furious. Cas has some sort of silent exchange with Sam and then he\u2019s practically running towards the kitchen.\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Sam presses, when it\u2019s obvious she\u2019s incapable of non-yelling speech and thus isn\u2019t talking. Jo takes at least five deep breaths.\n\u201cMom\u2019s pissing me off,\u201d she says, carefully. \u201cShe keeps treating me like I\u2019m ten.\u201d\nAnd then everything just fucking goes to hell because she\u2019s sobbing into Sam\u2019s shoulder within a span of seconds. Dean starts quietly panicking because as much as he loves Jo, he\u2019s got no idea how to handle emotional things like this. He turns and Cas is there at his shoulder like he\u2019d fucking teleported, holding a hot mug of something that smells heavenly.\n\u201cHere,\u201d he says, holding it out towards Jo. \u201cGabriel taught me how to make his hot chocolate.\u201d Jo reaches out for it, sniffles nice and wet and manly, and takes a long drink.\n\u201cThanks,\u201d she mumbles, and a couple of stray tears make tracks down her face. Sam makes a you can go now face; Dean rolls his eyes.\n\u201cGot any more of that?\u201d he asks Cas once they\u2019re back in the kitchen. Cas just smiles.\n\u00a0\nSam walks through the kitchen approximately forty-five minutes later, looking tired in just about every single way possible.\n\u201cCrisis averted?\u201d asks Dean, keeping his voice down.\n\u201cCrisis averted,\u201d Sam sighs back. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go crash. She\u2019s gonna spend the night here, talk to Ellen tomorrow. You know how it is.\u201d And with that he stumbles off towards his room. Poor fucker has school tomorrow. Cas frowns.\n\u201cIf Jo\u2019s on the sofa\u2013\u201d\n\u201cMy bed\u2019s more\u2019n big enough, if you\u2019re not squeamish about sharing,\u201d says Dean, aiming for casual and missing it by at least seven astronomical units.\n\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Cas murmurs, and looks oddly at Dean. He clears his throat and pours a tall glass of water, then walks it over to the living room, willing himself with every fiber of his being to calm the fuck down.\nJo\u2019s curled up like a cat under the blankets, and he leaves the glass for her on the coffee table before kissing the top of her head and heading back to the hallway.\nCas is already in his room, hands at the buttons on his collar (no inappropriate thoughts, Dean Winchester, no inappropriate thoughts), and Dean swallows several times before fishing a clean t-shirt and sweats out of his closet.\n\u201cHere,\u201d he says, and holds them out to Cas. \u201cYour clothes are probably a bitch to iron, no point getting \u2018em wrinkled.\u201d\nHe pulls his shirt over his head and shimmies out of his jeans with fucking agonizing casualness as Cas steadily unbuttons his oxford, drapes it neatly over the back of his chair, then steps out of his own pants before folding them in half over the shirt. Dean\u2019s half-surprised to see that Cas is ignoring the sweatpants in favor of just a t-shirt and boxers.\nNo complaints.\nThe bed dips when Cas slides under the covers with him and Dean\u2019s practically swooning; the sensation is so strange but so welcome, and if it\u2019s a little weird that they fall asleep facing each other, it\u2019s no one else\u2019s business.\n\u00a0\nDean wakes up at precisely 4:13 in the morning from one of the most vivid nightmares he\u2019s ever had. He lies in bed for a couple of minutes, trying to breathe, trying to stop panicking.\nHe used to field-strip and clean his dad\u2019s guns on nights like this. Practiced motions, old motions, fluid and easy like breathing. The noise never woke John, drunk and dead to the world, and it was like a lullaby for Sam.\nIt\u2019s out of the question now, so Dean gets up as quietly as he can, shuffles over to his desk, and starts drawing in the weak light coming through the window.\nHe captures the terror in his dream-Hell, the tortured souls, a hand \u2013 his hand \u2013 holding the knife, the too-familiar torture-master\u2019s twisted face. He captures the way radiant light finally burst through the stinking clouds of ash and sulphur and he captures the hope on the faces of all the other souls, but something about the angel that rescued him resists. The face isn\u2019t right, the wings aren\u2019t right, nothing\u2019s right except for a hand, gripping him tight, and his shoulder still tingles where it was burned in the dream.\nDean\u2019s not big on omens or dreams or any of that hoodoo crap, but there\u2019s something about this one he really can\u2019t shake. He\u2019s on his fifth try of the wings when the comforter rustles.\n\u201cDean?\u201d Oh, christ, the way Cas says his name, all sleepy and rough, burns right through him in ways it really shouldn\u2019t.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he whispers back. \u201cI wake you up?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d says Cas, voice low. \u201cI had a... strange dream. Are you alright?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Uh, couldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d He knows Cas knows it\u2019s a lie, but he\u2019ll explain in the morning.\n\u201cCome to bed, Dean,\u201d murmurs Cas, and fuck everything, he so could\u2019ve chosen a better way to phrase that. Dean swallows.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he finally breathes, and drops the pencil back in a jar before sliding back under the covers, honestly a lot closer to Cas than he\u2019d intended.\nCas\u2019s eyes search his face, glimmering faintly in the darkness, and then he reaches out and puts his palm on Dean\u2019s still-bare shoulder.\nIt feels right.\n\u00a0\nDean\u2019s awake before Cas the next morning; he steals a couple of seconds to admire how completely relaxed he looks when he\u2019s asleep, long eyelashes painting shadows on his cheeks, no trace of the typical furrow in his brow. He\u2019s so totally screwed, he thinks for the thousandth time, but he\u2019ll deal with it.\nHe gets out of bed (again), quiet and slow so as not to wake Cas, and checks his phone.\nJo Harvelle\n &gt;&gt; I\u2019m heading home fyi. Sam locked the door behind us, he\u2019s at school and I\u2019m gonna go to the roadhouse\nSasquatch\n &gt;&gt; Jo\u2019s heading back to The Roadhouse. I think she\u2019s feeling okay, for now.\nThey\u2019re from roughly an hour and a half ago; he types back a reply after closing his bedroom door behind him as quietly as possible.\nJo Harvelle\n&lt;&lt; Ok I how you\u2019re doing better. Don\u2019t worry about coming in to the shop today,. Ash and I can deal without a piercer for the day&lt;&lt; Hope*\n\nCas is still asleep by the time he finishes showering; he contemplates shaving the half-beard he\u2019s been growing out of sheer laziness, decides it\u2019s not worth the effort (for the fourth day in a row), and heads for the kitchen.\n\nHe makes a quick detour to put the B-side of The Times They Are A-Changin\u2019 on; it\u2019s not often that he gets in a Bob Dylan mood, but whatever. It has nothing to do with the fact that Cas has an unchecked obsession with this record. It\u2019s not even Dylan\u2019s best \u2013 at least in Dean\u2019s superior opinion \u2013 but he\u2019s the last person to judge musical taste. Well, except when it comes to Sam and Gabe.\n\nSo he starts on some omelettes and coffee and toast and bacon, hums along as he stirs half-and-half into Cas\u2019s coffee, and by the time \u2018The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll\u2019 is on, Cas pokes his head into the kitchen.\n\n\u201c\u2018Morning,\u201d says Dean cheerfully, because it\u2019s obvious that Cas woke up less than two minutes ago and his hair is sticking up everywhere. He drops himself into a chair and Dean passes him his coffee, steadfastly ignoring how.... kind of awesome this feels.\n\n\u201cJo left?\u201d Cas rasps, after taking a long drink of coffee.\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Dean slides the warmer omelette onto a plate and hands it to Cas, then puts his own back onto the pan. \u201cShe and Ellen do this every so often. I get it, though, they\u2019re\u2013\u201d\n\nThe racket his phone makes cuts him off, and he stares at the Ellen Harvelle calling in fear before swallowing and answering it.\n\n\u201cUh, hello?\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you for telling me where my daughter was last night,\u201d comes Ellen\u2019s voice, sharp and familiar.\n\n\u201cI, um\u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cSave it,\u201d she sighs. The pan\u2019s started smoking; he fumbles with the phone, says, \u201cshit, hang on a sec,\u201d and switches it to speaker on the countertop.\n\n\u201cAre you guys\u2013 is everything cool?\u201d he asks, flipping his omelette over and wincing at its half-burned state. Cas snorts at him.\n\n\u201cSame ol\u2019, same ol\u2019,\u201d Ellen replies. \u201cAnd you really think I didn\u2019t know where she\u2019d go? After finding the three of you all squeezed together Jo\u2019s bed every time John had a bad night? I thought you were smarter\u2019n that, boy.\u201d He can feel his ears turning red as Cas starts covering his laugher.\n\n\u201cYeah, well....\u201d He clears his throat. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you later, Ellen.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks, honey,\u201d she says, and Dean hides a smile as he hangs up.\n\n\u201cInteresting,\u201d says Cas, eyes sparkling with mirth. Dean sneers elegantly at him and goes to change the record out of spite.\n\n\u201cWhat time are you teaching today?\u201d Dean eventually asks around a mouthful of egg.\n\n\u201cOne-thirty.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerfect.\u201d Dean swallows and grins. \u201cI\u2019m in the shop at two, I\u2019ll drive you to campus.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll need to stop by my house,\u201d Cas says, then yawns enormously with his arms over his head and his whole body arching into it. Dean accidentally inhales some coffee, coughs, and then drains the rest of his mug\u2019s contents.\n\nCas raises an eyebrow at him then gathers his plate and mug and utensils and sets them down in the sink; Dean scoops up the last of his bacon and follows suit. It\u2019s already nearing eleven and they need to get a move on; Dean changes his boxers and throws on some jeans and his favorite henley as Cas takes a quick, three-minute shower and comes out smelling like Dean.\n\n\u201cThis is what you were doing last night?\u201d asks Cas, leaning over the sketchbook on his desk.\n\n\u201cMm-hmm,\u201d Dean hums back, hunting for a clean pair of socks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d murmurs Cas, and Dean just side-eyes the fuck out of him.\n\n\u201cDude, it\u2019s Hell,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s what I dreamed about. Tortured souls, demons, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why you couldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d Cas phrases it like a statement but it\u2019s more of a question, looking for confirmation. Dean suddenly feels shy, like it\u2019s childish of him to admit to a bad dream.\n\n\u201cYeah, I guess,\u201d he mumbles, and pulls on his socks. \u201cC\u2019mon, we gotta get going if you\u2019re gonna be on time.\u201d Cas looks at him like he understands, which is about seven kinds of weird and not something Dean wants to process right now.\n\nHe grabs a jacket and his favorite scarf from the coat closet (something Sam had gleefully pointed out was chic, whatever that\u2019s supposed to mean \u2013 it\u2019s gray and soft and long enough to pile all around his neck, so he doesn\u2019t give a shit), along with a navy-blue, slightly lumpy, hand-knitted beanie that he mostly only wears because Jo had made one for him and a dark red one for Sam. He is so ready for this weather.\n\nCas puts on one of his fucking metrosexual itchy wool cardigan things and then pulls on his trench coat, the one that Dean\u2019s learned to spot in a crowd. He\u2019s got no idea how Cas stays warm like that but it works for him, so whatever.\n\nThe stop at Gabriel\u2019s house is slightly longer than intended; Cas makes lunch in his slightly-rumpled shirt from yesterday and then starts practically fucking stripping in front of him while Dean\u2019s on the phone with one of yesterday\u2019s consults, rolling his shoulders as he slowly unbuttons and pulls off his oxford, trading it for a clean one. Thankfully, getting changed out of his pants is only slightly less pornographic. Dean doesn\u2019t put it past Cas to be completely unaware of what he\u2019s doing.\n\nThey\u2019re on campus a bit before one; Dean ends up walking with Cas to his office because they\u2019re engrossed in a conversation about which one of Gabriel\u2019s pastries is the best, and, because it\u2019s such a vitally important and pressing conversation, Dean doesn\u2019t want it to end.\n\nCas\u2019s ears and nose are pink by the time they reach his building; Dean pulls off his hat and rotates the jewelry in his earlobes, then tugs on them.\n\n\u201cWhy do you do that?\u201d asks Cas, all curiosity and zero judgement. His voice echoes unnaturally in the stairwell.\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou tug on your ears,\u201d Cas clarifies, and walks out into the hallway proper. It\u2019s much warmer in there than it was in the stairwell.\n\nDean grins and says, \u201cGiving \u2018em some play is good. It keeps the circulation going. \u2018Specially important when it\u2019s cold like this, just like you don\u2019t wear metal jewelry when it\u2019s freezing, because that\u2019s how dumbasses end up with frostbite.\u201d\n\n\u201cInteresting,\u201d says Cas, and leans forward to scrutinize the jewelry he\u2019s wearing. It\u2019s some of his favorite, actually \u2013 gorgeous olivewood plugs with amber cabochon inlays \u2013 but he can smell his own shampoo and body wash on Cas and his hair is still rumpled and it\u2019s all so distracting. \u201cThose look nice on you.\u201d Dean grins even wider.\n\n\u201cUm, excuse me? Castiel?\u201d Both of them turn to see a short, sort of super adorable brown-haired girl shifting her weight and looking everywhere but Cas\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d And Dean can see the shift from Cas-his-friend to Castiel-the-TA.\n\n\u201cI just, um\u2013 I was wondering, on the homework? If it\u2019s okay to use Labovian transcription.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d says Cas, with a reassuring teacher-smile.\n\n\u201cOh, okay,\u201d she says, breaking into a nervous smile. \u201cThank you!\u201d\n\nThe second they walk into Cas\u2019s office, Dean bursts out laughing.\n\n\u201cDude, are all your kids madly in love with you?\u201d\n\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Cas makes a strangled sort of laughing noise and hangs his coat over the back of his chair, then sets his leather satchel on his desk. Dean is forcibly reminded that he\u2019s friends with a guy who owns and uses a leather satchel. He\u2019s also related to another one.\n\n\u201cShe thinks you\u2019re gorgeous,\u201d Dean explains, trying to hide a shit-eating grin, \u201cthat\u2019s why she was all nervous. It\u2019s obvious.\u201d Cas snorts.\n\nThere\u2019s a knock on the open door, and Dean half-turns.\n\n\u201cHey, Castiel, I was wondering if you could proofread something real quick,\u201d says a paunchy, slightly older guy, roughly their height. He\u2019s clearly at the tail end of the graduate program. \u201cI\u2019m not interrupting anything, am I?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, please come in,\u201d says Cas, glancing quickly at Dean.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s your\u2013\u201d A pause, and his eyes flick from Dean\u2019s eyes to his nose to his chin to his earlobes. \u201c\u2013friend?\u201d\n\nDean is instantly on edge.\n\n\u201cZachariah, this is Dean, a family friend.\u201d Dean shakes Zachariah\u2019s hand with a vicious sort of pride at the honor of being called a family friend. \u201cZachariah and I both TA in the department.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll get out of your guys\u2019 hair,\u201d says Dean with a tight smile. \u201cHey, uh, Cas\u2013 I\u2019m at work \u2018till nine tonight, so...\u201d\n\n\u201cOh? Where do you work? On campus somewhere?\u201d asks Zachariah, and there\u2019s a particular kind of sneer curling his lip that makes Dean want to punch his fucking lights out.\n\n\u201cI own my own business,\u201d says Dean, cold and flat, \u201cand if I don\u2019t head out now, I\u2019ll be late. See ya, Cas.\u201d Another curt smile and a nod and he\u2019s out of there.\n\nHe\u2019s still so damn put off by that conversation that he nearly forgets to clock himself in. Ash is instantly wary; he knows how bad Dean\u2019s temper can get when he\u2019s provoked.\n\n\u201cWhat happened, man?\u201d he asks, in that calm voice of his that could pacify a whole plane of crying babies. Dean can feel himself relaxing slightly, being back in his environment, in the familiar smell of the shop.\n\n\u201cNothin\u2019,\u201d he mutters. \u201cSome guy was bein\u2019 a douche, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nDean regrets nothing about his life. Absolutely nothing. He doesn\u2019t regret stretching his ears or any of his tattoos or piercings; he only wishes that people would be polite enough to just leave him alone. He\u2019s never had any huge confrontations over his mods (barring The Diner Incident, but neither he nor Sam will ever talk about that), but all of the little ones add up and make him progressively lose his faith in society. His phone chirps.\n\nCastiel Milton\n&gt;&gt; I\u2019m sorry about Zachariah. He\u2019s often unapologetically rude in his refusal to mind his own business.\n\n&lt;&lt; It\u2019s ok I\u2019ve dealt with douchebags before. Don\u2019t waste your time apologizing for him. Go teach your class remember to file with your students&lt;&lt; Flirt* dammit\n\n&gt;&gt; I don\u2019t flirt.\nDean puts his phone back in his pocket and takes a deep breath. It\u2019s more touching than he\u2019d care to admit, that Cas was worried about him being upset.\nHe spends the hour before his first appointment drafting a tattoo \u2013 a sun/moon themed half-sleeve for next Thursday \u2013 and he\u2019s satisfied with it so far. The appointment goes smoothly, too, since it\u2019s just filling the color on last week\u2019s linework; the dude he\u2019s working on is just the right amount of talkative, and it turns out he\u2019s also a fan of Springsteen so Dean gets to listen to Born To Run as he works. Not bad at all.\nSam comes in and flops down on the couch in their front room approximately twenty minutes later, and Dean shoos him into Gabe\u2019s place because the kid is seriously in need of some coffee and nutrition. He wheedles food out of Gabriel on his break and helps him tie Sam\u2019s shoes together, where he\u2019s sprawled gracelessly in an armchair. He\u2019s back at the shop when Sam wakes up, but hearing the reaction is just as good.\nCas stops by a half hour before the shop closes, while Dean\u2019s cleaning and disinfecting, and Dean\u2019s back home with Sam and the Miltons before he knows it.\nThis, he could get used to.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOctober blurs into November blurs into December and the next thing Dean knows, he and Sam are making plans to spend Christmas Eve with the Miltons before their customary Christmas Day with the Harvelles. Bobby\u2019s coming out from South Dakota this year, which is a fucking momentous occasion, and Dean is both anxious and excited about introducing him to Castiel. He knows that Bobby is gonna like him, though, because Cas is so very much family now that it\u2019s absurd.\nHe\u2019s got all of his presents bought and wrapped \u2013 in proper wrapping paper, even. Dean\u2019s always been total crap at gift-giving so he\u2019s really glad that no one he knows is into it. He usually just gives and gets one thing per person.\nHis phone rings, way too early in the morning. He picks it up without looking at caller ID.\n\u201cHello?\u201d\n\u201cDean, my siblings are coming for Christmas,\u201d blurts Cas, without preamble.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he mumbles, rubbing his eyes and turning over on his back. He can hear Gabriel in the background, sounding frustrated.\n\u201cThey decided that they want to spend Christmas with us,\u201d Cas huffs, clearly irritated at the prospect. \u201cThey\u2019re... They can be difficult, if you don\u2019t know how to deal with them.\u201d\n\u201cSo? Sam \u2018n I\u2019ll just stay home if it\u2019s too crowded at Gabe\u2019s. We\u2019re talking Balthazar and Anna, right?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d says Cas quickly. \u201cWell, yes, Balthazar and Anna, but I don\u2019t want you to stay home. I\u2019d like to spend the holidays with you.\u201d\n\u201cAw, Cas, I feel my heart growing two sizes too big,\u201d Dean teases. \u201cIf it\u2019s cool with you that Sam and I crash your family time, we\u2019ll do it.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d breathes Cas, and Dean can feel his gratitude over the phone.\n\u201cJust next time, don\u2019t call this early,\u201d Dean chuckles. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later, yeah?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Thank you, Dean. I mean it.\u201d\nThey hang up and Dean tosses his phone somewhere near his feet, then scrubs a hand over his face and stares up at the ceiling. He doesn\u2019t know much about Cas\u2019s and Gabe\u2019s family. They don\u2019t like to talk about it; Dean gets it. He doesn\u2019t really talk about his family, either. He\u2019s learned that their family is huge and mega-religious and that it was hard for them to escape, as Gabe had let slip one night while fantastically drunk. Cas has a grand total of five siblings but only two he keeps in contact with \u2013 Balthazar, older than Cas, who grew up in England, and Anna, a year younger than Sam, who moved to England with him when she started college.\nAs selfish as it might be, as far as Dean\u2019s concerned, Cas\u2019s family is him and Sam and Gabe and Ellen and Jo and Ash. They\u2019re the ones who love him and make him smile and cook food for him and make him coffee and tease him; family don\u2019t end with blood, and they\u2019re the evidence.\n\u00a0\nBobby drives into town a week later, and Dean\u2019s hit with a flurry of texts the second he leaves the shower.\nJo Harvelle\n&gt;&gt; Dean I can hear the truck it\u2019s like a mile down the road\n &gt;&gt; Get our ass over here seriously\n &gt;&gt; Your*\n &gt;&gt; BOBBYS HERE asking why you\u2019re not and\n &gt;&gt; Sam\n &gt;&gt; Bring Cas\nEllen Harvelle\n &gt;&gt; If u dnt get ur butt here in 5 min im not going to feed u\nHe hastily towels off his hair and sticks a toothbrush in his mouth.\nCas Milton\n&lt;&lt; You\u2019re not busy right? We\u2019re gonna be at your house in like 2 minutes to pick you up Bobby\u2019s here\nGabriel Milton\n&lt;&lt; Get to the roadhouse asap Bobby\u2019s in town\n\u201cSam,\u201d he shouts through the door, but he can already hear sounds of frantic scrambling from down the hall.\nGabriel Milton\n&gt;&gt; Oh shit. I\u2019ll take a long lunch today and stop by\n\n\u201cI know, I know,\u201d Sam yells back, \u201cJo sent me, like, seven texts. Lemme get dressed.\u201d\n\nCas Milton\n&gt;&gt; You\u2019re lucky I was up early today. Call me when you get here, I\u2019ll be ready to go.\n\nThey\u2019re out the door in record time and Sam\u2019s grinning this grin, huge and infectious, and Dean can already feel it starting to creep across his own face. The Impala purrs to life under his hands; he blasts Led Zeppelin the whole way to Gabe\u2019s place and from there to The Roadhouse, and Sam doesn\u2019t even complain.\n\nBobby, Ellen, Jo, and Ash are still outside when they pull up, and Dean can still feel the heat from the truck\u2019s engine when he vaults out of the Impala.\n\n\u201cHey, Bobby,\u201d he calls, still grinning, grinning, then Bobby\u2019s beard twitches in his own approximation of a smile and Dean hugs him, tight and brief. He can smell the old leather of the truck and grease and gun-cleaning oil and everything his childhood was.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re takin\u2019 care of that car, right?\u201d asks Bobby gruffly.\n\n\u201c\u2018Course I am,\u201d Dean scoffs back, and he knows he\u2019s glowing as Bobby claps him on the shoulder.\n\n\u201cGod damn, Sam, you grow any more\u2019n you won\u2019t be able to fit in a house,\u201d Bobby grumbles, then lets himself get swept up in a huge, Sam-sized hug. \u201cAnd I\u2019m guessin\u2019 you\u2019re Cas, right? The boys\u2019ve been singin\u2019 your praises for months.\u201d He sticks out a hand. \u201cGood to meet you, kid.\u201d\n\nCas shakes it and Dean thinks that if he grins any wider, his face is going to split in half. He looks at Ellen, who\u2019s got one of her rare, soft, I\u2019m-not-going-to-gut-you smiles on.\n\n\u201cFood?\u201d he asks hopefully, and throws in a charming smile. She crosses her arms.\n\n\u201cGet your ass inside, Winchester,\u201d she barks, without real malice. \u201cYou too, boys. No point freezin\u2019 our asses off in the snow.\u201d\n\nBreakfast ends up being a three-hour-long affair with way too much food and apple cider and no beer just yet. Gabriel waltzes in as Ellen brings out the pie, slaps Bobby on the back, and eats nearly as much of the pie as Dean does. At 2:04 in the afternoon, Dean remembers he\u2019s supposed to be at the shop four minutes ago; he grabs his jacket and scarf and distractedly kisses Ellen on the cheek while promising to be back for dinner, he\u2019ll close early and send Ash home at three, it\u2019ll be fine. As he\u2019s leaving, Sam and Cas are huddled close together, discussing something to do with the language used in legislation. He doesn\u2019t let himself dwell on it.\n\nHe\u2019s lucky it\u2019s a Sunday, because he gets away with closing fifteen minutes early and gets back to The Roadhouse at six, where he catches Sam sneaking a drink from Cas\u2019s beer while Ellen\u2019s in the back room. Dean elbows him and says, \u201cyou know you\u2019re driving us home tonight, right?\u201d\n\nSam scowls and Cas laughs, his nose crinkling up in the most endearing way possible.\n\nDean braves the cold and the dark to head outside with Bobby and a flashlight, where he proves that yes, he\u2019s been taking good care of his baby. They stay out there for an hour, verbally picking apart the Impala, and Dean can\u2019t feel the tip of his nose by the time they head back inside, but he forgets about it as soon as Ellen announces that dinner\u2019s ready.\n\nHe ends up really spectacularly drunk and equally as giddy two hours after that, in spite of the truly staggering amount of food he\u2019d eaten. The only things that really stick out to him are belting out \u2018Wanted Dead Or Alive\u2019 with Sam and kissing Gabe on the face for bringing scotch, but everything else comes as brief flashes: Cas\u2019s fingers curling around a glass of beer, the way he laughs, full-throated, when Bobby tells a dumb story about the garage, the look on his face when he tries eggnog for the first time, watching him down a row of shots without even getting fazed.\n\nJo stumbles up to her room at 10:30, yelling at Dean the whole way for having to work Monday mornings when it\u2019s his day off. Dean laughs like it\u2019s the funniest thing he\u2019s ever heard and finishes his whiskey.\n\nSomehow, the clock flies, and then it\u2019s past two and Sam\u2019s ushering him and Cas into the back seat of the Impala while both he and Bobby yell, slurred, that he\u2019d better not screw her up in any way, shape, or form.\n\nIt\u2019s only when they\u2019re back in the apartment that Dean realizes something is off.\n\n\u201cHey, wwhhhoa, Cas,\u201d he says to Sam. Sam raises his eyebrows.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Sam,\u201d he corrects, pointing at himself. Dean shakes his head and immediately regrets it.\n\n\u201cNo, no, no, no,\u201d he says firmly, \u201cCas\u2019s here. Why isn\u2019t he\u2013\u201d He gestures vaguely. \u201c\u2013not?\u201d\n\nSam rolls his eyes. At least, Dean thinks Sam rolls his eyes. Everything is rolling around, at this point. Cas is leaning heavily against the kitchen wall.\n\n\u201cJust go to sleep,\u201d Sam says, and pushes Dean lightly towards his room. He\u2019s struggling to get out of his jacket and button-down and shirt and he catches glimpses of Sam standing in front of Cas in the hallway, his hands at the buttons on Cas\u2019s shirt; Dean makes a sort of half-grumble, half-snort noise and just falls the fuck into his bed with his jeans half-on.\n\n\n\nA phone rings at the fucking crack of dawn the next morning. There\u2019s a grunt from somewhere next to him and the screen\u2019s lit up on the floor next to his bed and a pile of clothes, then:\n\n\u201cDean, hand me my phone.\u201d\n\nCas reaches over him towards the floor and, in the process, presses his chest flush against Dean\u2019s back (and how the hell did either of them even end up\u2013? and Dean could\u2019ve sworn he\u2019d been wearing pants\u2013) so Dean numbly reaches down, grabs the phone, and hands it to Cas.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d He tries to go back to sleep but Cas is still close, much too close, can-feel-his-breath close, and that\u2019s all he can process right now. His limbs feel like lead. \u201cNo. Yes. On a bender.\u201d Dean can\u2019t help but chuckle at Cas\u2019s tone. The voice on the other end of the phone gets much louder.\n\n\u201cOh my god, are you with someone?\u201d comes a filtered, crackly female voice.\n\n\u201cGoodbye, Anna,\u201d Cas groans, and tosses the phone back onto the floor next to the pile of what Dean now realizes is Cas\u2019s clothing. \u201cFor the love of god, Dean, please don\u2019t wake me up for at least the next six hours.\u201d\n\n\u201cUh, yeah,\u201d he manages to choke out, because that\u2019s when it finally clicks that they\u2019re in the same bed, under the same covers, wearing a negligible amount of clothing, and the last thing he registers before passing the fuck out is that that\u2019s Castiel\u2019s arm around his waist.\n\n\n\nHe wakes up some time later to a crippling hangover and Cas curled into his side. Cas\u2019s hair is sort of tickling his shoulder and he does his best not to wake him up as he checks his phone.\n\nJo Harvelle\n&gt;&gt; You works NOT believe how hungover I am\n &gt;&gt; Would*\n &gt;&gt; It\u2019s not fair Ash doesn\u2019t get hangovers and he isn\u2019t working till 1. You owe me coffee so bad\nSasquatch\n &gt;&gt; Are you even awake yet?\nHis phone ends up somewhere between his bed and the floor and he groans quietly because it\u2019s only nine in the morning and the more of this hangover he can sleep away, the better. Cas is still passed out, breathing slow and steady into his shoulder, so Dean turns in to face him and falls asleep like that, with Cas\u2019s hair tickling his nose every few breaths.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDean.\u201d\nA hand and gentle shaking and light coming from the windows and Dean just turns onto his stomach and groans.\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cDean, wake up. You need to eat.\u201d\nBack up, that\u2019s Cas\u2019s hand on his back now so he pushes himself up, blinks blearily, and tries to come up with something intelligent to say. All he can think of is Sam\u2019s hands on Cas\u2019s shirt.\n\u201cYou slept here?\u201d he ends up blurting out. \u201cThe whole night, I mean.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I slept on the windowsill,\u201d Cas deadpans.\n\u201cWait\u2013\u201d He racks his brain and comes up with something that involves a pretty dangerous amount of spooning through the haze of alcohol. \u201cOh.\u201d Then, \u201cWait, you made breakfast?\u201d\nCas gives him this look, like does it look like I could\u2019ve survived this morning without breakfast? and yeah, Cas definitely looks like he\u2019s been through the wringer.\nDean tries to grin but his stomach lurches, so he excuses himself, stumbles into the bathroom, and proceeds to vomit up what feels like all of his intestines and then some.\n\u201cGabriel called,\u201d says Cas from the kitchen when all sounds of retching have stopped. \u201cHe\u2019s wondering if we\u2019re still alive, and he says that Jo seems \u2018unhappy.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cJo do\u2019en\u2019t \u2018ake hango\u2019ers \u2018oo well,\u201d Dean calls back around his toothbrush. Everything tastes fucking squeaky and disgusting. A chuckle from the kitchen.\n\u201cNeither do I.\u201d\n\u201cHey, where\u2019s Sam, anyways?\u201d he asks, after most of the gross is gone from his mouth. He tosses his shirt back into his room from the hallway (it now stinks like sweat, alcohol, and puke) and walks into the kitchen to find Cas in rumpled pants and a half-buttoned oxford, sitting at the table and looking like he\u2019s about to pass out. Again. Cas shrugs in response.\n\u201cGod, yes,\u201d Dean groans, and helps himself to the mountain of pancakes. \u201cCas, seriously, you keep makin\u2019 breakfasts like this and I\u2019mma have to marry you.\u201d\nOops.\nCas\u2019s eyes are wide and he looks like he\u2019s almost about to be on the verge of saying something but Dean winks exaggeratedly and chuckles, smoothing the whole thing over. Good going, dickwad. He pulls out his phone and dials Sam.\n\u201cHey, this is Sam! Can\u2019t reach the\u2013\u201d He hangs up.\n\u201cFine, asshole,\u201d he mutters, and pulls up his texts.\nSasquatch\n &gt;&gt; Where did you run off to please tell me you\u2019re not studying it\u2019s winter break\nJo Harvelle\n &gt;&gt; Go bug Gabe for coffee. He\u2019s probably hung over too\nCas puts his forehead down on the table with a quiet thump.\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m going to throw up again,\u201d he groans.\n\u201cNot at the table,\u201d Dean replies quickly, and pats his shoulder. He gets a muffled grunt in response.\n\u00a0\nThey eventually crawl their way back to Gabriel\u2019s house and find Sam there, sprawled across the couch and with Gabe somehow in the crack between Sam\u2019s gangly limbs and the couch\u2019s backrest. Dean muffles his laughter and takes a picture, definitely not for blackmail purposes.\nCas forces a cup of chamomile-mint tea on him, which tastes like minty, wilted grass, but Dean chokes it down anyways because Cas has promised him in every language he knows that it\u2019ll help settle his stomach.\nHe warms his hands on the mug and looks around the room as Cas changes into old jeans and a t-shirt that\u2019s nine kinds of faded, under the pretense of definitely not sneaking a look at him. He\u2019s never seen Cas in clothing that\u2019s not pants-and-an-oxford (or boxers and a t-shirt but he\u2019s not gonna think about that) but hey, he\u2019s got no complaints. He takes a couple of minutes to study the handful of DVDs Cas keeps in his room. Gabe\u2019s \u2018private collection\u2019 consists of every Casa Erotica DVD ever made, but Dean\u2019s not surprised to see that Cas has fancy collector\u2019s editions of classic movies, and a couple of newer titles, and then\u2013\n\u201cWatchmen?\u201d He whirls on Cas, DVD case in hand. \u201cYou like Watchmen?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a brilliantly crafted social commentary,\u201d Cas says, frowning deeper than the fucking Grand Canyon. \u201cMy interests aren\u2019t limited by medium. The Cold War and mid-eighties were a fascinating time period, and Watchmen frames the\u2013\u201d\n\u201cMy god, dude, I could kiss you right now,\u201d Dean blurts out again, without thinking.\n\u201cUh, am I interrupting something?\u201d says Sam from the doorway, looking distinctly uncomfortable and equally as sleepy.\n\u201cNo,\u201d says Cas smoothly, \u201cunless Dean intends to make good on that.\u201d Dean snorts to cover his tracks and walks out, still holding Watchmen. Gabe turns to look up at him from the sofa.\n\u201cDamn,\u201d Gabriel rasps, \u201cyou sure as hell look happy.\u201d\n\u201cThe next time you find a happy person with a hangover, let me know,\u201d he snaps back, and then throws the Watchmen DVD into the tray, turns the TV on, and flops down by Gabe\u2019s feet.\nThis is getting much too out of hand. He\u2019s already reviewed and assessed the fact that his feelings about Cas are way past the point of his dick saying \u2018god yes\u2019 and have crossed into the dangerous territory of \u2018please don\u2019t leave my life,\u2019 which is a) absolutely terrifying and b) not something he ever wants to admit to, ever, but if his dumb brain keeps up like this, he\u2019s going to seriously mess things up between him and Cas.\nHe can deal with the unrequited thing. That\u2019s cool. He might be egotistical and over-confident at times, but that\u2019s only to mask the fact that he\u2019s got a big fat zero as far as sense of self-worth goes. He loves his job and he loves his mods and he loves Ash and Jo as co-workers and he loves his family but the bottom line is, he\u2019s a high school dropout with a GED who has nothing to offer to someone who graduated with honors from an Ivy League school. He can deal with the fact that in this respect, Sam is much better than he is. Sam is the obvious choice. He can deal with that, as long as he\u2019s still got a little place in Cas\u2019s life.\nA mug suddenly appears under his nose, with Cas\u2019s hand attached to it. The opening title and \u2018The Times, They Are A-Changin`\u2019 just started playing on the TV, which is probably what attracted Cas to the living room in the first place.\n\u201cYou really should finish this,\u201d he says, with one of those dumb adorable not-quite-smiles.\n\u201cYes, Ellen,\u201d he sighs back, and takes the mug. Their fingers touch.\n\u00a0\nAnna and Balthazar fly in from Chicago a few days later and Gabriel forces another nice dinner on them, so, naturally, Sam is freaking out.\n\u201cJesus christ, Sam, it\u2019s not your wedding night,\u201d Dean grunts, and adjusts the uncomfortable collar of his nice, respectable shirt, respectably tucked into a respectable pair of pants. He\u2019s disgusted by his reflection, and puts in the most eye-catching plugs he can find. Rebel against society, that\u2019s him.\n\u201cI know, but this is Cas\u2019s family,\u201d he says, fumbling with his tie.\n\u201cAnd? So\u2019s Gabe.\u201d\nHe gets a long-suffering Dean for that.\nThe drive to the restaurant only serves to make Sam more and more anxious, and put Dean in a progressively worse mood. Parking sucks because it\u2019s primetime dinner hour at a nice restaurant, and Dean can\u2019t help but worry if someone\u2019s gonna accidentally knock his baby.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a reservation, under Gabriel Milton,\u201d Sam says to the Nice Lady Up Front, whose official title Dean can never remember.\n\u201cDean,\u201d comes Cas\u2019s voice from behind, and he turns to see Cas walking quickly towards them, looking distinctly frazzled. His hair is more haphazard than usual.\n\u201cWhoa, is everything okay?\u201d he asks, automatically reaching a hand out towards him.\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna\u2013\u201d Sam finishes by motioning towards the waitress that\u2019s walking away.\n\u201cOh,\u201d says Cas, distractedly running a hand through his hair, \u201cyes. Gabriel is parking, and\u2013 Dean, I have to warn you, Anna and Balthazar can be a handful.\u201d\n\u201cDude, it\u2019s cool.\u201d Dean shrugs. \u201cThey\u2019re your family.\u201d\n\u201cSo are you,\u201d Cas says quietly. Dean can feel the side of his mouth quirking up in a smile and he puts a hand on Cas\u2019s shoulder, just briefly.\n\u201cWe should, uh, follow S\u2013\u201d\n\u201cCassie,\u201d booms someone from the door, \u201caren\u2019t you going to introduce us?\u201d Cas flinches like he\u2019s been electrocuted and whirls.\n\u201cBalthazar, this is Dean,\u201d he says after clearing his throat. \u201cDean, this is my brother.\u201d Dean politely shakes his hand. Balthazar is blonde, with Cas\u2019s bright-blue eyes and lean body, wearing the most ridiculously low-cut v-neck Dean\u2019s ever seen.\n\u201cI\u2019m Anna,\u201d says the willowy, equally-blue-eyed redhead. \u201cCastiel\u2019s sister.\u201d She\u2019s got Cas\u2019s shy smile. Dean shakes her hand, too, and nods at Gabe, who looks tired.\n\u201cSam\u2019s over that way,\u201d he says awkwardly, and they weave towards where Sam\u2019s shaggy head is bent over the menu. He jumps up the instant he sees them and introduces himself enthusiastically; Balthazar seems instantly smitten and Anna does a lot of batting her eyelashes. Dean sits in the corner closest to the window and opens his menu to the alcohol.\nCas sits down right next to him and leans over.\n\u201cRelax, Dean,\u201d he murmurs, just for him, and touches his forearm. Dean experiences the fascinating sensation of having his heart rate triple while simultaneously feeling all of the tension leave his body.\nDinner is a mostly normal affair; Dean finds himself relaxing slightly after half a beer, but it\u2019s still nothing compared to what it was like meeting Cas for the first time. That was all of his walls crumbling as if they\u2019d never existed, realizing that Cas is good, Cas is okay. This feels more like Anna and Balthazar reaching out, feeling his walls, acknowledging them, and leaving it at that.\nHe and Sam leave the Miltons to do Various Family Things and head to The Roadhouse. Dean spends the entire time wishing Cas and Gabe were there.\nThe night passes slowly and the next morning positively crawls. Both he and Sam are mopey and bad-tempered and Dean spends the whole day re-watching his Dr. Sexy DVDs until, at 10:32pm, his phone chirps.\nCas Milton\n&gt;&gt; Are you or Sam home right now?\n\n&lt;&lt; Yeah what's up\n\n\n&gt;&gt; I\u2019m coming over.\n\n\n&lt;&lt; Is everything ok,\n&lt;&lt; ?*\n\n\n&gt;&gt; I\u2019ll be there in five minutes.\n\n\u201cSam?\u201d\n\u201cWhat,\u201d he drones back tonelessly.\n\u201cUh, d\u2019you know if everything\u2019s cool with Cas?\u201d he asks, and pauses Dr. Sexy. \u201cHe\u2019s on his way here, so...\u201d\n\u201cWait, what?\u201d Sam pads out into the hallway. \u201cDid something happen?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve got no clue,\u201d says Dean, frustrated, and hunches his shoulders.\nTrue to form, five minutes later, there\u2019s a knocking at their door. Sam is nearly flattened by the door as Cas storms in, looking more furious than Dean\u2019s ever seen him.\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d asks Sam, quiet and calm. Cas takes a deep breath.\n\u201cCas?\u201d\n\u201cMy, uh, siblings,\u201d he says, enunciating clearly, \u201ccan be difficult to deal with.\u201d\nSam opens his mouth and Dean knows he\u2019s about to ask for clarification, if Cas wants to talk and share, but Dean can tell that\u2019s the last thing he wants right now.\n\u201cHey, sit down,\u201d Dean says, getting up from the couch. \u201cTonight I\u2019m gonna introduce you to Indiana Jones.\u201d And fucking bingo, right there \u2013 Cas\u2019s shoulders relax, ever so slightly, and he looks at Dean with gratitude written on his face.\nSam\u2019s asleep halfway through Temple of Doom and taking up most of the couch, so that Cas is trapped between Sam\u2019s shins and Dean\u2019s side for the rest of the movie, and he\u2019s yawning heavily by the time the it\u2019s over.\n\u201cI\u2019ll shove Sasquatch off so you can sleep,\u201d Dean says, and he\u2019s about to do it when Cas\u2019s arm stops him.\n\u201cNo, don\u2019t wake him,\u201d he scoffs. \u201cThat\u2019s rude.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not gonna sleep on the floor, and I\u2019m sorry, but Sam hasn\u2019t cleaned his room in years. I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s radioactive in there.\u201d\n\u201cYour bed\u2019s more than big enough for two, if you\u2019re not squeamish about sharing,\u201d says Cas, and in the half-light from the TV, Dean can see his mouth quirk up. He puts his hands up in defeat.\n\u201cYour call, dude,\u201d he says, and gets up to find their extra comforter. Cas is already in Dean\u2019s room by the time he walks back into the living room to throw the comforter over Sam, and he can\u2019t help but flick some hair out of Sam\u2019s face. His brother\u2019s turning into a total moose. He also needs to shave those fucking ridiculous sideburns.\nCas is sitting on the bed by the time he goes into his own room, holding his lit-up phone, and looking just plain defeated. Dean know he\u2019s absolutely terrible with talking about it and words and making people feel better, but he thinks he should at least try. He clears his throat.\n\u201cSo, um, what happened?\u201d\nCas glances up at him and sighs.\n\u201cAnna and Balthazar are very loud with their opinions,\u201d he finally says. \u201cSometimes they don\u2019t realize their hurtfulness.\u201d\nDean nudges at some clothing on the floor with his foot, and shoves it in the general direction of his closet. The only light in his room is coming from his desk lamp and Cas\u2019s phone.\n\u201cYeah, I know how that is,\u201d Dean mutters. A sympathetic \u2018sorry\u2019 seems out of place.\n\u201cI was also fairly rash in my reaction,\u201d continues Cas. \u201cGabriel has called four times, Anna\u2019s called twice, and Balthazar three times.\u201d\n\u201cAre you gonna call \u2018em back?\u201d He sits down on the bed, a respectable distance from Cas. A respectable, three-inch distance. Cas shakes his head.\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be better if I let this sit overnight,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cI should\u2019ve expected to get into some sort of argument, though. It\u2019s never peaceful when the four of us are together.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well\u2013\u201d Dean clears his throat. \u201cFamily\u2019s real good at getting you pissed off. Sam and I sure as hell know that.\u201d God, he\u2019s fucking terrible at this; he lifts a hand with the honest intentions of resting it between Cas\u2019s shoulder blades but he ends up stuck on his lower back, with the knots of his spine smooth under his fingers. He knows he should move but his hand isn\u2019t responding. When Cas leans back into the touch, it seems instinctive. \u201cYou, uh, sure you don\u2019t want me to kick Sam off the couch?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d rather sleep with you than wake Sam,\u201d Cas says, voice low.\n\u201cOuch, dude,\u201d Dean replies, and uses a theatrical wince as an excuse to finally move his hand.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d murmurs Cas softly once they\u2019re both in bed and the lights are off. \u201cI\u2019m sure I ruined yours and Sam\u2019s evening.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re always welcome here,\u201d Dean fires back, a little indignant and a lot more touchy-feely than he\u2019d like. He\u2019s never been one for these bedtime confessionals. \u201cI mean, seriously.\u201d He rolls over onto his stomach and slides his hands under the pillow, turning his head resolutely to the side so he doesn\u2019t do something dumb like stare at Cas.\n\u201cThank you, Dean,\u201d Cas repeats, and Dean squeezes his eyes shut so hard it hurts.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nChristmas is the usual food-filled, alcohol-fueled, crazy affair.\nIt turns out that Balthazar is actually a stunning chef (and the person who taught Cas how to cook, which explains a lot) so Christmas Eve\u2019s dinner is probably the best Dean\u2019s ever had. Anna is charming and Balthazar is ribald, and Dean spends the whole dinner pressed tightly between Cas and Gabe at the small table, shoulders rubbing every time either of them moves.\nDean gives Cas a silk-cashmere scarf with a gruff so you don\u2019t have to steal mine all the time. Cas\u2019s whole face lights up and Dean thinks yeah, he made the right choice, because the scarf is the same exact shade of blue that Cas\u2019s eyes are.\nDean gives Sam a huge box of books and movies that he always complains about missing on TV or having to renew from the library. Sam\u2019s grin is his favorite thing in the world.\nThe three of them \u2013 Dean, Sam, and Cas \u2013 sprint to the Impala and haul in a huge, commercial panini press, all wrapped up complete with shiny bow on top. It\u2019s the closest Dean\u2019s ever seen Gabriel to crying.\nDean has to fight back his own tears when he gets a flat, square-shaped box from the three of them, in turn, and opens it to find the rare-as-fuck, expensive, 20th anniversary commemorative Stairway to Heaven set, mint condition. He lets himself get swept up in Sam\u2019s monster hug when he\u2019s finally able to choke out a \u201cthanks, guys,\u201d and buries his face in his brother\u2019s shoulder to hide his grin.\nThe evening winds itself down after that, and they dig out the eggnog; Dean ends up spending a good amount of time talking to Anna, and notices at one point that Gabe pulls Sam aside. He can\u2019t hear what they\u2019re saying, but Gabriel puts something small in Sam\u2019s hand, covers it with his own palm, and then \u2013 Sam must be drunk, god damn, because he\u2019s handing out hugs like nobody\u2019s business tonight.\nHe tries, hard, not to think about the hug Cas gives him when they finally leave.\n\u00a0\nDean wakes up the next morning and decides, arbitrarily, to blast some Asia for no other reason than Christmas Day falling on a Tuesday this year.\n\u201cDude,\u201d Sam complains loudly from his room, \u201cAsia?\u201d\n\u201cC\u2019mon, man, you love this song and you know it,\u201d he yells back, and dances into the kitchen singing along to 'Heat Of The Moment' as loudly as possible.\nSam eventually cuts him off with, \u201cokay, Dean, just\u2013 Merry Christmas, okay, will you shut up?\u201d\nChristmas Day is another whirl of food and booze and laughter and old holiday music at The Roadhouse. Ellen\u2019s food is top-notch, as per usual, and Ash is wearing a sleeveless cutoff shirt, as per usual, and Bobby is drunk by three, as per usual. Dean takes a rare day to let himself bask in his family, how lucky he is to be surrounded by people who yell at him and fight with him and laugh with him and deal with the fact that, essentially, he\u2019s worthless and selfish and undeserving, but who love him despite that.\nThey might not be a conventional family, but Dean would die for any of them in a heartbeat.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBobby leaves the Friday before New Year\u2019s, the day after Anna and Balthazar fly back to England; Dean drives Sam and Cas and Gabriel out to The Roadhouse again, where they all have one last beer before Bobby hits the road.\nEllen hugs Bobby and Ash slaps him on the back and Jo kisses him on his whiskered cheek. He shakes hands with Gabriel and threatens his balls if anything happens to Sam or Dean, then shakes hands with Cas, lets Sam hug him, and then, inexplicably, he pulls Dean aside.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got somethin\u2019 special in Cas, kid,\u201d rumbles Bobby. \u201cDon\u2019t let it go.\u201d Then, in a gesture more sentimental than he\u2019s ever shown, he gently pats Dean on the cheek, and clambers into his truck.\n\u201cWhat the hell was that about?\u201d snorts Sam, coming up from behind him.\n\u201cI... nothin\u2019,\u201d he finally says, dazed, and looks over at Cas. He\u2019s smiling as Bobby pulls away, hands in his pockets and nose pink with cold. \u201cNothin\u2019 I didn\u2019t already know.\u201d\n\u00a0\nNew Year\u2019s Eve finds him and Sam at Gabe\u2019s place, all four of them squeezed onto the couch and already hammered by the time they\u2019re counting down as the ball drops. Gabriel yells loudest of them all when the new year officially rolls around, and Dean laughs until he cries when Sam full-on grabs Gabriel\u2019s face between his huge paws and kisses him, square on the mouth. Cas is laughing harder than Dean\u2019s ever heard him laugh. Sam turns redder than a stoplight and slumps down against the couch, slurring, \u201cyou assholes.\u201d\nDean then entertains the idea of kissing Cas and passing it off as I was drunk, and immediately dismisses that notion with the distinct aftertaste of self-disgust.\nSam ends up wandering away around 3 in the morning and, thirty minutes later, Gabe finds him passed out on his bed. He shrugs, drops his jeans, and kicks the door closed.\nDean\u2019s thoroughly alcohol-sodden brain finds this absolutely fucking hilarious, and he\u2019s still giggling when Cas helps him unfold the sofa bed in the living room and unearth sheets and blankets. He can forget for the night that he\u2019s a full twenty-three years old. Cas stumbles away, laughing to himself, and then with a quiet flick, he turns the lights out.\n\u201cYou bastard,\u201d Dean says loudly, and is overcome by laughter again when he trips over something. He picks out Cas\u2019s dark shape a split second before they collide, shoulders-chest-hips-thighs in a clumsy line.\n\u201cQuieter,\u201d hisses Cas back, and then both of them are stifling laughter and stumbling towards the bed. Cas is pulling at his shirt in the dark, fingers fumbling up over his collar, against his neck, and then Dean\u2019s calves hit the side of the bed and he topples over, bringing Cas down next to him.\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna be so hungover,\u201d Dean says to the ceiling, goofy grin plastered across his face. Cas is tangled up like a rag doll somewhere near him, warm and pliant, and Dean can feel every area where they\u2019re touching \u2013 Cas\u2019s thigh against his knee, a hand splayed across his stomach, their sides pressed together.\n\u201cDean?\u201d\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\nCas slings himself over Dean\u2019s body and that\u2019s it, he\u2019s gone, he can\u2019t even move. He can feel Cas\u2019s fingers, still searching for something on his chest, neck, jaw, warm breaths curling against the patch of skin under his ear \u2013 does he even know what he\u2019s doing to Dean right now?\n\u201cDean,\u201d Cas murmurs again, and then there are fingers wrapping around the back of his neck and a nose bumping accidentally against his jaw and oh, oh, that\u2019s a mouth, and Dean can\u2019t \u2013 he can\u2019t deal with this, even though his body\u2019s arching up to meet Cas against his will, even though he\u2019s sweeping the pad of his thumb across Cas\u2019s bottom lip the way he\u2019s always wanted to, but he can\u2019t, he can\u2019t do this, he cannot do this.\n\u201cI\u2013\u201d He swallows, mouth dry. \u201cI can\u2019t\u2013\u201d And shit, one of his hands is half-curled in Cas\u2019s hair and he\u2019s got no idea how it ended up there.\n\u201cYou are insufferable,\u201d breathes Cas, cheek against his, stubble scratching, and Dean\u2019s impressed that he was able to actually pronounce \u2018insufferable\u2019 before Cas is gone. He slides off to the side and the warmth is gone, but it\u2019s not a rebuke, not with the way Cas\u2019s fingers trail across Dean\u2019s chest. He misses the contact, misses it so much in the split second it\u2019s gone that he immediately reaches out and pulls himself close to Cas.\nCas is out within seconds, breathing softly against his shoulder and with an arm draped across Dean\u2019s hips. Dean lies awake much longer, much more sober than he\u2019d like, drowning in how little he deserves this.\n\u00a0\nThe next morning is positively brutal and Dean swears he\u2019s hung over for the next three days. Cas spends the rest of the week slowly gearing up for the next quarter, and Sam festers in anticipation and anxiety for his new classes. The only ray of light, Sam constantly repeats, is that Cas is TA for the Language and Law course he\u2019s taking.\nDean, in turn, scrambles to make sure all of his paperwork is done for the Body Art Expo \u2013 seller\u2019s permit, health license, re-doing his bloodborne pathogens certification just in case. He also spends a fair amount of time digging through his sketchbooks and folders upon folders of half-finished doodles, trying to find something suitable that could pass as a portfolio. Or something. He eventually whirls into Gabe\u2019s kitchen, slams an inch\u2019s worth of art down on the table, and makes the three of them pick five somethings each. To his surprise, Cas picks out the still-half-finished sketch from Dean\u2019s nightmare all those months ago, where there\u2019s a hand gripping his shoulder tight.\nHe cleans up the pieces that are unfinished while Sam powers through his first week of classes; Cas is the one who drives him to the airport, since Sam has classes and Gabriel\u2019s working. Cas drives a 2008 Prius (and Dean complains about him being a hippie for the whole drive) and stays with him for the whole check-in procedure, as his nerves get steadily worse and worse.\n\u201cRelax, Dean,\u201d he murmurs at one point (Dean\u2019s about to twist his driver\u2019s license in half) and then leans in and puts a palm on his lower back. One simple gesture, and 90% of the tension is gone. He is so, so screwed.\nHe manages to get his bags checked without incident \u2013 he has the airline employee assure him at least three times that the bigger suitcase has been marked fragile, because there\u2019s no way he trusts an airplane to not damage his favorite tattoo machine \u2013 and then Cas gently prods and nudges him towards the security screening and Dean can\u2019t breathe because he\u2019s an hour away from being hurled through the air in a dinky metal tube.\n\u201cAirplanes don\u2019t even look aerodynamic,\u201d he hisses vehemently.\nCas, bless him, is infinitely patient.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine, Dean. I promise.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, right.\u201d\n\u201cRemember to call Sam when you land,\u201d Cas says, and the corner of his mouth turns up. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll want to know all about your ordeal.\u201d\n\u201cYou know, I might still be able to get a refund if I cancel fast enough,\u201d Dean says quickly, shifting his weight and fiddling with the strap of his messenger bag. Cas does the closest approximation of an eyeroll Dean\u2019s ever seen him do.\n\u201cHere,\u201d says Cas, and in one smooth motion, he pulls something out of his pocket, steps much too close to Dean, and fiddles with something on the side of his bag for a good ten seconds.\n\u201cWhoa\u201d is all Dean can say when Cas steps back (too far, much too far away now), because whoa. There\u2019s a keychain dangling from one of the loops on his bag, a round, silver medallion with Jimmy Page\u2019s symbol on one side and Bonzo\u2019s on the other.\n\u201cGood luck charm,\u201d Cas explains, and smiles just a tiny bit wider.\n\u201cThanks, Cas,\u201d he manages to whisper, and then they\u2019re hugging and it\u2019s weird because Dean doesn\u2019t do hugs. Cas is warm and solid and lean in his arms and Dean breathes him in, breathes in Gabriel\u2019s house and the cold chill from outside that still clings and the light smell of his aftershave.\n\u201cHave fun,\u201d Cas says, when they eventually pull apart. Dean realizes that his hand\u2019s stuck on the slope of Cas\u2019s neck and that Cas still has a hand on his side and wow, this is awkward, but Dean resolutely refuses to let go.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he murmurs back, and Cas\u2019s eyes are so fucking blue. He clears his throat. \u201cI should, uh...\u201d\n\u201cGo,\u201d says Cas, and that stupid smile is back on his face. He uses the hand still on Dean\u2019s side to give him a push; Dean reluctantly slides his hand away and moves into the line.\n\u201cAnd relax,\u201d Cas calls after him, \u201cyou\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\nDean looks back once he\u2019s through security, after putting his shoes and flannel shirt and belt and jacket and scarf back on, and grins at Cas, who\u2019s standing on the other side, hands in his trench coat\u2019s pockets and flyaway hair a dark smudge against the huge windows.\n\u00a0\nHe nearly has a heart attack seven separate times on the flight and thanks every deity he can think of for Gabriel reminding him that his phone can play music, too. Metallica sort of helps remedy his anxiety but when he finally lands in Orange County, he doesn\u2019t even stop to flirt with the hot blonde stewardess, just scrambles to be first off of the plane.\nThe airport is small and crowded and there\u2019s a fucking statue of John Wayne in the baggage claim area. Dean takes a picture of it and sends it to Sam, then dials his number.\n\u201cHey, Dean,\u201d he answers brightly, and with that, almost all of the tension and leftover anxiety in his chest dissolve.\n\u201cHeya, Sammy.\u201d\n\u201cHow was your flight?\u201d Sam asks, and Dean can see him snickering.\n\u201cUh, nice, thank you,\u201d he replies stiffly.\n\u201cAt least you landed,\u201d Sam reminds him, much too cheerfully.\n\u201cYeah, okay. I\u2019ll talk to you later, asshole,\u201d Dean snaps, and Sam\u2019s laughing as he hangs up.\n\u00a0\nPre-reg and set-up are long and boring and Dean actually breaks a sweat helping some other artists and piercers set up their booths, because it\u2019s fucking 68 degrees out in January. He ends up running into Sara Eberle, which turns him into a blabbering fanboy when she remembers him and confirms his appointment for Saturday afternoon.\nHe scopes out a couple of stick-and-poke artists and then finds himself in the chair at 5 the next afternoon, getting a kao yord yantra hand-poked by a ridiculously serene guy named Mike, who spent the last 15 years traveling between Thailand and Malaysia and Tibet.\nHe remembers a really shy girl watching nearly the whole process \u2013 she had messy, short black hair and bright blue eyes, which is definitely not the reason she stood out to Dean.\nFriday\u2019s half-day passes in a blur \u2013 between getting tattooed, getting appointments, and three people who\u2019d just sat down, stripped, and said \u2018find some skin and tattoo it,\u2019 he\u2019s had no time to call or text back home. When he finally trudges back into his hotel room, his phone is chirping petulantly at him.\nJo Harvelle\n&gt;&gt; Is Ignacio Barrera there omg get pierced by him so I can live vicariously through you\n &gt;&gt; Buy some jewelry for me too\n &gt;&gt; And this time remember that I\u2019m 27mm NOT 1\u201d\nSasquatch\n&gt;&gt; Knee-deep in work yet?\n &gt;&gt; Wow, guess so. Let me know how it goes.\n &gt;&gt; If you come back with drunk tattoos I\u2019m going to laugh so hard.\n &gt;&gt; I would say \u201cdon\u2019t forget to eat,\u201d but I figure that\u2019s not a problem with you.\nEllen Harvelle\n&gt;&gt; Good luck kiddo have fun :-)\nGabe Milton\n &gt;&gt; Get your ass tattooed. I\u2019ll be checking when you get home ;)\nCas Milton\n &gt;&gt; Sam assures me it\u2019s not disruptive to be texting you. Enjoy yourself, \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0438 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f, divi\u00e9rtete, amuse-toi, hab Spa\u00df, and help me keep Sam from worrying too much. He misses you. I do too.\nHe grins and calls Sam.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not actually going to get your ass tattooed, are you?\u201d Sam asks, without preamble.\n\u201cIt is tattooed, pipsqueak,\u201d he snarks back.\n\u201cOh. Ohhhh, yeah.\u201d He hears a low murmur in the background. \u201cCas says hi, by the way.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, so you\u2019re bummin\u2019 over at Gabe\u2019s place again?\u201d Dean puts the phone on speaker and sets it down in order to tenderly remove his t-shirt and admire the still-red yantra on his back. Sam chuckles.\n\u201cYeah, Cas and I went out for dinner and Gabe was working, you know how it is,\u201d he says, and Dean\u2019s heart drops. An uncomfortable, familiar thought-fear-feeling worms its way into his stomach.\n\u201cWell\u2013\u201d He\u2019s interrupted by a monstrous yawn. \u201c\u2013give Cas a pat on the head and Gabe a nice, big smooch for takin\u2019 care of your ass.\u201d\n\u201cUh, yeah, Dean,\u201d says Sam with an awkward, almost-nervous laugh, \u201csure.\u201d\nDean makes some excuse about waking up early and jet lag and ends the conversation. He ends up falling asleep to vague dreams about chasing after dark wings.\n\u00a0\nThe knot of worry in his chest takes root overnight and grows, snaking tendrils into every inch of his skin, and all he can think about when he\u2019s not tattooing is Cas \u2013 the way he\u2019ll smile at Sam sometimes, the way they have of huddling together to work on something, the way Cas listens when Sam\u2019s talking and talking about something that excites him.\n(It never occurs to him to look at the flip side of the coin.)\nThe second that needle hits skin under his gloves, though, he\u2019s sucked into clean lines and soft colors and that thing that apparently he\u2019s gotten well-known for \u2013 Ash says \u2018all the blogs online\u2019 love the way he fills color but Dean can\u2019t really see anything special about it. It\u2019s not very traditional and it\u2019s washy and watercolory but hey, at least he makes good money for it.\nHis hand\u2019s cramped up like a bitch by the time his appointment with Sara rolls around; she teases him for missing some spots while shaving and cleans up his knees and ankles for him. This is usually where he\u2019d be turning up the charm, getting tattooed by a really ethereally gorgeous woman, but there\u2019s something so Jo about her that Dean keeps the banter strictly outside the bounds of flirting.\nRight before she lays over the transfer paper, Dean\u2019s phone makes a racket from where it\u2019s stuck in his discarded jeans.\n\u201cGo ahead,\u201d says Sara, with a smile and a tilt of her head. Dean fishes the phone out, stares at the Cas Milton calling in warm disbelief, and answers.\n\u201cHey, Cas.\u201d\n\u201cHello, Dean,\u201d comes Cas\u2019s low rumble and fuck, Dean\u2019s filled with a warmth he shouldn\u2019t be feeling. In less than two seconds, all of his worry dissipates. He realizes, belatedly, that he\u2019s grinning. \u201cAm I interrupting?\u201d\n\u201cNah, you\u2019re good. What\u2019s up?\u201d Sara mouths at him and indicates that she\u2019s gonna start with the transfer paper; he nods back at her.\n\u201cOh,\u201d says Cas, \u201cI didn\u2019t have a particular reason for calling. Sam and Gabriel are busy, and it\u2019s very quiet without you.\u201d\nDean chuckles because, oh, the irony \u2013 Cas is trying to say \u2018I miss you\u2019 to someone who has an even harder time choking out \u2018I miss you too.\u2019\n\u201cMan, you\u2019d have a field day here,\u201d he says instead. \u201cTons of people with weird accents.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d Dean can see the way he\u2019d lean forward, way past any normal boundaries of personal space. \u201cCalifornia English, no doubt, and probably some fantastic examples of Chicano English.\u201d Dean laughs and says he\u2019s got no idea what Cas is saying.\nThe end up talking all the way through Sara\u2019s multiple corrections of the pattern, and Dean fumbles through an explanation when Sara says, \u201cAlright, hun, I\u2019m gonna get started,\u201d and the sound of her gun rattles over the phone.\n\u201cI\u2019ll show you on Monday,\u201d he replies, grinning, when Cas asks what he\u2019s getting tattooed.\n\u201cI hope you aren\u2019t taking Gabriel\u2019s suggestion seriously, then,\u201d Cas fires back, and Dean can perfectly picture the wicked, teasing look in his eyes.\n\u201cWhatever, dude,\u201d Dean scoffs, and Sara\u2019s smiling wistfully up at him by the time he hangs up.\n\u201cBoyfriend?\u201d she prompts, needle moving purposefully across the side of his calf.\n\u201cNah,\u201d Dean says, going for off-hand, and his laugh comes out forced. \u201cJust, uh, good friend of mine. Kinda like a family friend.\u201d\nSara just keeps looking at him, much too long to be comfortable, and then nods like she gets it.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got it bad, huh?\u201d she finally murmurs, mouth turning up wryly.\n\u201cNo way,\u201d Dean scoffs automatically, but he can feel the tips of his ears reddening. Sara gives him another look and gently pats his knee with her free hand.\n\u00a0\nSunday finds him hobbling around the expo, trying to move his still-tender new additions as little as possible. He tattoos nearly ten more people after his second session with Sara, then winces his way to where most of the booths selling jewelry are as the expo winds down. There\u2019s a pair of rough-faced amethyst plugs his size that are just begging to be bought so he sighs and splurges, then buys Jo a really stunning pair of plugs hand-carved from rutilated quartz.\nThe expo winds down quickly and it\u2019s actually chilly when they\u2019re taking all of the booths down; Dean gets a solid couple of jetlagged hours of sleep before heading back to the airport, sadly without Cas to see him off this time. His return flight includes a stopover at O\u2019Hare, which is a fucking blessing, and he\u2019s still so traumatized by his flights that he even lets Sam have a quick hug at the airport.\nGabe and Cas are over a half an hour after he and Sam get home, at which point Dean is hobbling around in basketball shorts and trying to find a way to lie down on the couch without actually touching his legs to it.\n\u201cDamn,\u201d sighs Gabe wistfully, \u201cso it wasn\u2019t an ass tattoo.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Cas murmurs when Dean gingerly sits down and ends up resting his feet on the coffee table. \u201cThe level of detail is incredible.\u201d He shakes his head disbelievingly and sits down next to Dean. \u201cIt suits you very well.\u201d\nDean preens. Of course it\u2019s fucking beautiful, Sara Eberle tattooed it \u2013 he\u2019s solid black from his knees to his ankles, broken by swirls and eddies of crosshatching, loops of flesh-tone breaking the black ink. He doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s ever loved a tattoo more than this one.\nHe takes a swig of beer, savoring it with his eyes closed, when a light touch on his shin makes him jump and nearly spill half the bottle down his shirt. Cas\u2019s hand is hovering an inch over his leg and he\u2019s got this sorrowful, apologetic look on his face.\n\u201cMy apologies,\u201d he says, holding his hands up the way you would to a freaked-out animal. Dean snorts.\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d he says back, setting the beer down, \u201cyou just, uh\u2013 wasn\u2019t expecting it. \u2018S kinda tender.\u201d\n\u201cMay I touch it?\u201d asks Cas, carefully moving his hand back down towards Dean\u2019s leg. Dean shrugs.\n\u201cI guess. Just, uh, be gentle. Still hurts like a bitch sometimes.\u201d\n\u201cCute,\u201d says Gabe cheerfully, flopping down on the loveseat next to Sam. Dean rolls his eyes and tries his best not to shiver; Cas\u2019s fingers are dancing softly down his legs, tracing patterns he hasn\u2019t memorized yet, grazing so fucking tenderly across his skin that he thinks he\u2019s finally going to go crazy.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Friday before his birthday, Dean wakes up on the Miltons\u2019 couch at some ungodly hour in the morning to quiet noise in the kitchen. The morning sun is filtering weakly through dark-bellied clouds and there aren\u2019t many lights on, but he\u2019s got an idea of who\u2019d be up this early.\n\u201cCas?\u201d he croaks.\n\u201cMy apologies,\u201d Cas whispers back, standing close with a coffee tumbler in hand, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to wake you. Go back to sleep, Dean.\u201d And then \u2013 he thinks he might be dreaming this \u2013 Cas leans over the back of the couch, gently pushes his fingers through Dean\u2019s hair. By the time he\u2019s at the door, Dean is dead asleep again.\nHe wakes up again somewhere in the region of 9:30 to Gabriel and Sam banging around in the kitchen this time; he sits up, rubs his eyes, and grabs his phone.\nCas Milton\n&lt;&lt; What time are you done today, I\u2019d kill for Ellen\u2019s burgers for lunch\n\nA yawn and a stretch later, he runs a hand through his hair and heads for the kitchen. It smells like Gabe\u2019s doing french toast and his stomach growls in anticipation, but when he rounds the corner, the world stops dead.\n\nSam\u2019s got this goofy grin on his face and he\u2019s leaning down as he folds up the sleeves of his flannel, leaning down to kiss the smirk off of Gabriel\u2019s face.\n\nBack the fun bus the fuck up.\n\nDean makes a choked sort of indignant noise and Sam and Gabe look like deer in headlights and then Sam\u2019s yelling Dean, wait, hold on a second and Dean doesn\u2019t even know where he\u2019s going.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell is going on, Sam?\u201d he hisses, looking between his brother\u2019s earnest, too-big eyes, and Gabriel\u2019s silhouette in the kitchen.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t\u2013?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Sam, I didn\u2019t, so I\u2019d like you to explain exactly what the hell is going on,\u201d he snaps.\n\n\u201cI\u2013 well\u2013\u201d Sam swallows and runs a hand through his hair. \u201cDean, I thought you knew. It\u2019s not like either of us was hiding it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s nearly six years older than you,\u201d Dean says, much louder than intended.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s family,\u201d Sam fires back, even louder.\n\n\u201cSam,\u201d he starts, angry now, but Sam cuts him off.\n\n\u201cI can make my own decisions, Dean,\u201d he snaps. \u201cI don\u2019t need you to be Dad, too.\u201d\n\nDean is outside and slamming the door before he knows it.\n\nThe drive back to their apartment is filtered through an angry, red haze; he\u2019s only home long enough to change into clothes he didn\u2019t sleep in. The reason the house is empty serves to make him even more upset, and the next thing he knows, he\u2019s headed to campus.\nCas Milton\n &gt;&gt; I\u2019ll be done at 10:30. I\u2019d love to have lunch with you.\n\n&lt;&lt; I'm going to campus right now. Sam and I had a fight I kinda need to talk to you about something important\n\n\n\n&gt;&gt; Wait in my office. I\u2019ll be there as soon as I can.\n\nHe fumes his way through the steadily-falling snow and he knows he\u2019s being rude to the people he\u2019s shouldering through to get to the ling department, but he can\u2019t bring himself to care. The door neatly labeled with Castiel Milton, TA \u2013 Language and Law/Dialects of America is ajar so he nudges it open and drops himself into one of the chairs.\nThe clock reads 10:31 when Cas walks into the room; Dean jumps to his feet and they shuffle awkwardly for a second before Dean just blurts out, \u201cdid you know about Sam and Gabe\u2019s\u2013?\u201d and Cas stares at him. \u201cThat they\u2019re\u2013 you know, a... a thing?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2013\u201d It\u2019s the first time he\u2019s ever seen Cas speechless. \u201cI\u2019ve... had my suspicions, Gabriel has always been extremely fond of Sam, but\u2013\u201d\n\u201cHey, Castiel,\u201d chimes in a third voice, and Dean has to exercise monumental self-restraint to not punch Zachariah right in his smug face. He\u2019s leaning casually on the doorframe, eyes flicking between Dean, Cas, and the three inches of space between them, the way Dean is curved around Cas and their arms are brushing together. \u201cI, uh, hate to interrupt you and your friend, but could I borrow you for a moment?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid not,\u201d says Cas, low and dangerous and oh. \u201cDean and I have a bit of a family emergency going on right now.\u201d And then he just blows out the door, right past Zachariah, and Dean can\u2019t help sending a smug smirk over his shoulder as he follows Cas down the hallway.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s something more, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nCas\u2019s voice is soft over the Impala\u2019s deep purr.\n\u201cNothin\u2019,\u201d Dean mumbles, and pointedly stares through the windshield.\n\u201cDean,\u201d says Cas, and he knows that Cas can see right through him.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2013\u201d He runs his palms over the steering wheel, feeling all of the familiar bumps and nicks in the leather. \u201cSam has this way of... bringing Dad into our arguments.\u201d He exhales. \u201cI don\u2019t know, man. I need some time to think about this.\u201d\n\u201cGabriel is much older than Sam,\u201d Cas says, and runs a hand distractedly through his hair.\n\u201cI know,\u201d Dean replies, frustrated. \u201cGod knows Sam\u2019s smart, but I\u2019m scared he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s getting into.\u201d\n\u201cAs much as I care about your brother, I\u2019m worried that Gabriel could either be his usual blunt self and unknowingly or accidentally pressure Sam into something he isn\u2019t willing to do\u2013\u201d\n\u201cCas, jesus, I don\u2019t wanna think ab\u2013\u201d\n\u201c\u2013or, Sam could be seeking to experiment and chose someone whose feelings for him are much more than experimental.\u201d\nThe light is red, so Dean takes the opportunity to stare at Cas in disbelief.\n\u201cYou\u2019re serious,\u201d he says.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Cas deadpans back. \u201cGabriel\u2019s actions and feelings have long been outside the realm of platitude. I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t notice that earlier.\u201d\n\u201cGabriel is Gabriel, though,\u201d Dean grunts. \u201cHe flirts with everyone.\u201d\n\u201cRegardless, I hope both Sam and Gabriel know what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Cas murmurs, and leans his head against the window. Flurries of snow keep dancing in halos around his dark hair through the glass and Dean only realizes the light\u2019s turned green when the asshat behind him honks.\n\u00a0\nSasquatch\n &gt;&gt; I\u2019m staying the night here. We need to talk tomorrow.\n\u201cWonderful,\u201d Dean mutters, and throws his phone into his bag with more force than necessary. Jo looks over at him sympathetically; he clears his throat. \u201cReady to go?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Look, Dean\u2013\u201d\n\u201cDrop it, okay?\u201d He leans his elbows on the counter. \u201cIt\u2019s bad enough I gotta talk to Sam about this.\u201d\n\u201cGo home, have a drink,\u201d she sighs, and squeezes his shoulder. \u201cAsk Cas how it went.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d He turns his collar up before walking out into the near-blizzard; Jo waits for him to lock, gives him a brief, rare hug, and heads home.\nDriving through snow, Dean thinks, would be really great if he didn\u2019t worry so much about his car. He loves winter for its quiet and, somehow, it\u2019s even more ethereal from inside a car \u2013 silent save for the engine, soft and pale and cold, the stark whiteness of snow set off by dark clouds.\nAs much as he loves winter, he\u2019s eternally grateful that his and Sam\u2019s apartment complex has a parking garage. He pulls out his phone again as he climbs the stairs.\nCas Milton\n&lt;&lt; Hey is everything ok with you and Gabriel? I'm home if you wanna stop by or sow thing\n&lt;&lt; Something*\n&lt;&lt; Gonna make dinner too idk if you ate\n\n&gt;&gt; I\u2019ll be over shortly.\n\nWell, okay. He opens the fridge and realizes he\u2019s still got a tray of steak tips he\u2019d bought to make a stew (contrary to what everyone around him seems to think, Dean is actually a great cook, thank you very much). He shrugs, pulls out a pan, and starts heating up some oil to sear them in while he peels potatoes. There\u2019s a knock on the door about thirty seconds after he sets them on the stove.\nCas looks... irritated. It\u2019s better than full-on pissed, that\u2019s for sure, but it still means that something unpleasant must\u2019ve gone down.\n\u201cIs, uh, everything\u2013?\u201d He gestures vaguely. Cas heaves a sigh as he strips off his trench coat and the three layers he\u2019s wearing underneath, until it\u2019s just him in an old t-shirt and those jeans with a hole worn through the knee. Dean\u2019s surprised. Cas doesn\u2019t often do casual.\n\u201cI think...\u201d Cas pauses, rolls his shoulders. \u201cI think they have it figured out. Neither of us gave them enough credit, though that\u2019s understandable, due to the circumstances in which you and I found out.\u201d\nDean takes a deep breath and nods.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he says, and nods again. \u201cOh-kay. So, uh, dinner?\u201d He jabs a thumb towards the kitchen and tries a smile. Cas\u2019s mouth twitches up.\n\u00a0\nThey eat on the couch and Cas ends up roping him into watching one of Sam\u2019s movies, something called The Prestige that Dean is wholly unprepared to love as much as he does by the time the credits roll.\n\u201cCas?\u201d he asks tentatively, because Cas is slumped over like he\u2019s half-asleep. He gets a grunt in response. \u201cYou spendin\u2019 the night?\u201d\n\u201cCopula deletion,\u201d Cas mumbles. \u201cCommon, for you. If you\u2019d like me to, I will.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I\u2013\u201d He clears his throat. \u201cThat\u2019d be, uh, nice.\u201d\nCas sits up and stretches so that the worn cotton of his shirt rides up and, for a brief second, shows a strip of pale skin. Not that Dean looks. Then, to his surprise, Cas gets up, yawns, and pads his way into Dean\u2019s room.\nDean frowns, picks up the dishes, dumps them in the sink, then peers into his room to find Cas sprawled across his bed and already dead asleep, still in the same shirt. He snorts and goes back to do the dishes.\n\u00a0\nTwo in the morning finds Dean at his desk. The street lights through the window are just barely bright enough for him to see what he\u2019s drawing and he can hear Cas\u2019s deep, even breaths behind him; he knows sleep is going to come soon.\nIn the meantime, though, his hand is just itching and he needs to get this out before he can sleep. He\u2019s been thinking about that old Hell-dream he had, about the angel and the light, and he thinks he\u2019s finally got it \u2013 dark, shimmering wings flared impressively, a face full of focus and a wild sort of exhilaration, holy and righteous and beautiful.\nHe lazily scribbles some more shadows and stifles a yawn; he\u2019s done here, and it\u2019s time to sleep. Cas is taking up most of the bed and Dean does his best to clear himself a space free of Cas\u2019s limbs, which ends with Cas unconsciously curling his fingers into the front of Dean\u2019s shirt.\nFor about the thousandth time that day, Dean regards his situation. He still can\u2019t shake how woefully fucking inadequate he must be in Cas\u2019s eyes, and even if now Sam isn\u2019t an option for him, there\u2019s no way Cas would ever stoop so low. Worthless.\nThe thought is almost comforting in its familiarity, like the poison whisper of Alastair in his head, the way he used to snarl not good enough, Winchester, you have to scratch \u2018em till they bleed and bleed and bleed only this time, the tables are turned and he\u2019s the one bleeding. His arm tingles with phantom pain.\nHe squares his shoulders and closes his eyes and the last thing he remember thinking before he slips away is that, somehow, the angel turned out looking like Cas.\n\u00a0\nThe next morning, when Sam walks quietly into the apartment, he and Dean blurt out, \u201cokay, so I overreacted,\u201d at the exact same time. Sam runs a hand through his hair and takes a deep breath.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t\u2013 look, I\u2019m sorry about what I said,\u201d Sam explains, earnest and wide-eyed, \u201cand I coulda said it way better, but I think you need to trust me on this.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you coulda,\u201d Dean says stiffly. \u201cI had reason to worry about you, Sam.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d he mumbles.\nDean shifts his weight. He is terrible at this kind of thing. He has no idea how to explain what he\u2019s feeling because he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s feeling \u2013 honestly, he\u2019s still pretty fucking weirded out because Sam and Gabriel? and he\u2019s worried about Sam and worried about Gabriel and there are really no words for this kind of thing.\n\u201cJust... don\u2019t be dumb,\u201d he finally says. Sam scoffs in an attempt to lighten the mood, which, surprisingly, ends up working. Dean squeezes his shoulder and thinks that even if it\u2019s gonna take getting used to, things are gonna be okay.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt all goes to hell the morning of his birthday.\nHe\u2019s never been particularly fond of birthdays (what\u2019s there to celebrate? only his sixteenth and eighteenth and twenty-first really mattered), but at least he can use the \u2018it\u2019s my birthday\u2019 excuse to get away with doing shit that annoys Sam.\nLike blaring Led Zeppelin the second he wakes up.\n\u201cYeah, okay, happy birthday,\u201d Sam grumbles, rubbing sleep out of his eyes as he slumps down in a kitchen chair.\n\u201cI shoulda quit you,\u201d Dean croons in response, \u201clooooooong time ag\u2013\u201d Sam takes a halfhearted swing at him and he jerks back, laughing, then turns the stereo down.\nWhen they\u2019re done with breakfast and the runout groove has been making muted pops for fifteen minutes, Sam goes to shower and Dean changes the record. He goes for some Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young because he\u2019s sort of in the mood for folky stuff, and then he realizes that Stills\u2019 \u20184 + 20\u2019 is on the record he\u2019s holding.\nIf he\u2019s honest, this is why he doesn\u2019t like birthdays \u2013 the way he always manages to work himself into a deep session of corny introspection that makes him fucking hate everything.\nThe song isn\u2019t helping, he thinks, as Stephen Stills softly sings that four and twenty years ago, I come into this life, the son of a woman, and a man who lived in strife. All of his early memories deal with John, John yelling, John being absent, John moving them on a monthly (sometimes weekly) basis just to chase after something that could possibly earn them some money, John working any job available, John trying to make time for his boys, John trying to make money to support his boys, trying to do the best by them, trying so hard and being so earnest, trying and falling short every time. And he worked like the devil to be more.\nIt kinda goes to show that his most important birthdays were always about Sam \u2013 the only ones that really mattered were when he could finally get a driver\u2019s license to drive Sam to school when John was gone, and when he finally became a legal adult (but he doesn\u2019t want to think about that, though, not when it skirts so closely to the narrow escape from his personal hell).\nAdmittedly, he\u2019s come pretty far from the broken shell of a person he used to be. He\u2019s nowhere near fixed or good or worthwhile but he functions, he\u2019s able to make people happy through what he does, he has some pretty fucking incredible people around him. He\u2019s got Jo and Ash and Ellen and Bobby, Sam and Gabriel. He\u2019s got Cas. Maybe not in the way he wants Cas (but that\u2019s ridiculous, he doesn\u2019t want things, he\u2019s not allowed to want things) but he\u2019s so fucking grateful to have Cas, any way he can get him. He knows he doesn\u2019t deserve a friend like Cas, but that doesn\u2019t mean he isn\u2019t grateful from the depths of his soul.\nStills gets to night after sleepless night, I walk the floor and I want to know, why am I so alone? before Dean just fucking gives up and changes the record, puts on the triple A-side Stairway to Heaven single he got for Christmas instead. He\u2019s not gonna ruin his own mood on the only day he can get away with purposefully annoying everyone else.\n\u00a0\nThey go to Physical Graffitea for lunch and meet Cas there; Sam wolfs his food down and hurriedly kisses Gabe (Dean pointedly looks away) before catching a bus to campus and since Cas is done with classes and teaching for the day, he and Dean loiter for a while before heading back home.\n\u201cI had to find out from Gabriel that it\u2019s your birthday, you know,\u201d says Cas as Dean fumbles with the lock, fingers frozen to the bone.\n\u201cBirthdays aren\u2019t all-important,\u201d Dean snorts. The lock finally turns and he walks into the (mercifully warm) apartment, sighing. \u201cI\u2019m twenty-four now, so what?\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019re as old as I am, for one,\u201d Cas fires back, eyes twinkling, as he sheds his trench coat and shakes snow off of his shoes.\n\u201cYeah, whatever. The only thing that birthdays are good for is having an excuse to be an asshole.\u201d He waggles his eyebrows and winks at Cas. \u201cSo in how many languages can you call me awesome?\u201d\nCas deadpans something in Russian and shakes out his coat, eyebrows up.\n\u201cYou just insulted me, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cI called you a pig,\u201d Cas says matter-of-factly, and nudges past Dean to get in the coat closet. His face is so perfectly composed that Dean can\u2019t help it, he dissolves into laughter and then Cas starts chuckling too and they\u2019re caught against the door of the closet and, okay, Cas is more than a little close and he smells like the cold and then Dean\u2019s body is moving without his permission, pitching way too far forward, and he kisses Cas.\nIt\u2019s brief.\nCas\u2019s lips are chapped and his nose is cold.\nDean stumbles back once he\u2019s able to regain control of his body and stares. Cas is looking right back at him, cool and level, and then Dean panics.\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna\u2013\u201d He lurches for the front door and nearly trips over himself, grabs the doorknob, then whips around to see Cas still staring at him. \u201cCas, I\u2019m sorry, I really crossed a line and I\u2019m\u2013\u201d He swallows nervously and grabs for the doorknob again. \u201cI\u2019m just gonna go and\u2013\u201d\n\u201cDean.\u201d Don\u2019t you fucking open that door, says Cas\u2019s face, stormy and righteous and bearing a really creepy resemblance to the angel from that stupid dream Dean can\u2019t let go of.\n\u201cLook,\u201d he starts, brain wildly trying to find some sort of reason or excuse, and then Cas is close again, crowding him against the side of the couch.\n\u201cThe only reason you should apologize,\u201d Cas says, low and quiet, \u201cis if it was a mistake.\u201d Dean blinks stupidly for a couple of seconds while he tries to put two and two together.\nFour, shouts his brain, unhelpfully.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nCas frowns at him, then reaches out and fixes his necklace so that the clasp is at the back of his neck. The amulet feels like lead.\n\u201cI thought it was obvious how I feel about you. Evidently, I was wrong.\u201d He says it matter-of-factly, like he\u2019s talking about the weather, the same way he talks about everything.\nDean stares, hapless, as Cas walks back and actually puts his coat in the closet.\n\u201cWh\u2013 you what?\u201d\n\u201cNext time I fall for you in every single way possible, I\u2019ll be sure to spell it out for you, clearly, in every language I know.\u201d Cas\u2019s voice is soft now, with that delicate edge of teasing that always hits Dean in all the right places.\n\u201cI\u2013 you\u2013\u201d Dean swallows, tries to swallow around the lump in his throat. \u201cCas, I can\u2019t.\u201d His voice breaks on that last syllable. Cas looks at him, looks through him, and crosses his arms.\n\u201cYou poor, selfish bastard,\u201d he murmurs, \u201cyou don\u2019t think you deserve this, do you?\u201d\nIf it\u2019d been anyone else, Dean would\u2019ve decked them. Instead, he just stands there and takes it because that\u2019s what he is \u2013 a poor, selfish bastard who knows he doesn\u2019t deserve this. Cas\u2019s words just confirm it.\n\u201cThere\u2019s stuff I\u2019ve done that I\u2019m not proud of,\u201d he finally says, unable to meet Cas\u2019s eyes. \u201cPretty bad stuff, okay? I mean, you\u2019re\u2013\u201d He gestures at Cas, in his neat oxford shirt and nice pants. \u201c\u2013and I\u2019m a high school dropout who tattoos for a living.\u201d\n\u201cDean,\u201d says Cas again, and this time his eyes are soft and earnest and then Dean spills everything, tells him all of the things that only Sam knows.\nHe tells Cas the truth about his family, about John and Sam and Mary and himself, about when he started tattooing. He tells Cas about moving city to city every few weeks or, if they were lucky, every few months, because John always drank his way out of holding a steady job. He tells Cas about doodling on receipts and scraps of take-out bags in the car, to pass the time.\nDoodles turned into artwork and the first time they\u2019d met one of John\u2019s old Marine buddies, covered neck to ankles in tattoos, that was it. He\u2019d been bright-eyed with ambition at first \u2013 scrimping and saving to buy his first kit, begging and charming butchers into giving him leftover scraps of pigskin to practice on, buying the cheapest ink possible.\nHe\u2019d been fifteen, sixteen back then and fighting with the law to get a GED as fast as possible; sometimes the seedier tattoo parlors would take him on for the few days they\u2019d be in town and he\u2019d be able to make a solid hundred bucks (if he was lucky) to feed Sam, buy him school stuff, keep his clothes looking nice.\nAnd then they wandered into New Orleans as a hot July turned into an even more hellish August, and Dean met Alastair.\nAlastair had been rough and brash and cruel and he took Dean in with a wicked grin, gave him a gun, and told him to use it like a knife. Alastair\u2019s shop \u2013 no one knew what it was really called, they just called it The Rack \u2013 had been a place where people screamed as they got tattooed, held down by Alastair or whatever gang boss had sent them there while Dean would scratch and scratch, purposefully destroying the skin, purposefully doing it wrong, just to earn money to scrape by.\nHe\u2019d cried while tattooing a woman once, as she begged him to stop. He\u2019d tucked hair behind her ear with a shaking hand, leaving smudges of bloodied ink on her face, and apologized.\nAlastair turned the knife on him for the first time that night.\nJohn Winchester died of alcohol poisoning three weeks before Dean turned eighteen. The second midnight hit on his birthday, he took the Impala, shoved a sleepy Sam into the back seat, and drove for fifteen hours straight before pulling over at a rest stop to pass out.\nThey\u2019d pulled up to Bobby\u2019s garage, bruised eyes from lack of sleep, and Bobby had taken them in without a word.\nSam had started high school locally, near Bobby\u2019s place. After spending a year without tattooing, plagued by nightmares and haunted by the screams, Dean had made the executive decision to just move. Somewhere up north, somewhere cold and calm and the opposite of New Orleans\u2019 oppressive heat. He\u2019d forced Sam to stay in school, stay in one school, to not fuck up the most important part of his education.\n\u201cAnd I guess you know the rest,\u201d Dean finally whispers, licking his lips. He picks at the label of his beer. \u201cI don\u2019t deserve the kindness that anyone has shown me.\u201d\nCas just keeps looking at him, shoulders and thighs still pressed against his, and Dean can\u2019t bring himself to meet Cas\u2019s eyes. Cas sighs and pulls out his phone.\n\u201cI can drive you back to Gabe\u2019s,\u201d mumbles Dean. Cas shoots him an unreadable look.\n\u201cI\u2019m not leaving,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m telling Sam to go to our house after classes instead of coming here. I get the feeling you\u2019d prefer to not talk to him right now.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not\u2013?\u201d\n\u201cWhat I am doing is brewing you a coffee,\u201d Cas says quietly, then fucking kisses his forehead before getting up from the couch and going to the kitchen.\nDean lets his face fall into his hands. It feels weird, to finally confess to someone everything he\u2019s done, everything that makes him such a worthless excuse for a human being. It\u2019s not only weird, it makes him feel lighter. Like it\u2019s okay, somehow. He\u2019s been internalizing everything since Mary died and he started taking care of Sammy, building up walls and a cocky exterior, but now that he\u2019s fucking bared his soul to Cas, offered it up for him to scrutinize, he feels lightheaded and dizzy.\nWhen Cas comes back with coffee in his favorite mug, Dean accepts it with shaking hands. He takes a long drink, savors the bitter burn down his throat, and sets the mug down before slouching over and rubbing his forehead. He\u2019s still shaking and he can\u2019t swallow and he can\u2019t breathe and it still feels like the world\u2019s gone and upended itself, until Cas puts a hand on his back and suddenly everything slows down.\nHe turns and Cas is right there, less than a handspan away, and those stupid ocean-blue eyes are all full of it\u2019s okay. Dean hates being comforted \u2013 he hates pity and sympathy and are you okays, he\u2019d rather deal with a stressful situation by himself like A Grownup \u2013 but it\u2019s different when Cas\u2019s hand starts to curl around his side.\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna kiss you,\u201d Dean mumbles, and reaches up to hold Cas\u2019s face between his hands. \u201cThat\u2019s okay, right?\u201d\nCas just leans forward and kisses him in response, light and soft, and Dean fucking melts. He slumps forward against Cas and buries his forehead against his shoulder; Cas keeps an arm wrapped around his back, fingers carding idly through the hair at the base of Dean\u2019s neck.\n\u201cI have no idea how I haven\u2019t, like, scared you off yet,\u201d Dean croaks, muffled, \u201cbut goddamn, I\u2019m glad I haven\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cYou sell yourself short much too often,\u201d Cas murmurs back. \u201cI am both lucky and proud to be a part of your life.\u201d\nDean\u2019s spared trying to scramble for an answer when his phone rings.\n\u201cSam?\u201d he answers, frowning.\n\u201cHey, uh, what\u2019s going on?\u201d asks Sam. \u201cCas said\u2013\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Dean sighs. \u201cI just need to talk to him about somethin\u2019.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a pause. A much-too-long pause.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d says Sam, in that tone of voice like he\u2019s up to something.\n\u201cSeriously, Sam, forget about it. I\u2019ll see you at The Roadhouse around five, okay?\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Sam says again, still sounding like he\u2019s plotting. Dean hangs up and sighs, then takes another long swig of coffee.\nHe and Cas kill the next hour and a half watching Star Wars \u2013 Cas knows those are his safety blanket movies and puts on Return of the Jedi, god bless him \u2013 and Dean tries not to think about it. The big it. The fact that he lays across the couch when Cas goes to the bathroom with the intention of being spiteful, but when he comes back, Cas just slides in next to him as if it\u2019s commonplace, as if they\u2019d been doing it for years. Or the fact that he catches himself doodling idle circles just under the hem of Cas\u2019s shirt, callused fingertips smoothing over his warm skin.\nEven though everything between them is different, nothing has changed. Cas still nags at him to dress nicely the way he would on any other \u2018nice\u2019 occasion (it\u2019s my fuckin' birthday, Cas, I do what I want) and Dean makes sure Cas takes his own scarf instead of bogarting one of Dean\u2019s \u2013 but then Dean finds himself pressed up against Cas, gathering him up, oversized coat and thick sweater and scarf and all, carefully kissing him while still trying to get his mind wrapped around the fact that this is okay, this is good, this is something he\u2019s allowed.\nHe reluctantly pulls back and shifts his weight, puts his hands in his pockets.\n\u201cHey Cas?\u201d Cas reaches forward and fixes the collar of his jacket. \u201cUm... thanks.\u201d\nIt\u2019s utterly underwhelming and lame as fuck; he\u2019s horrible at gratitude and Cas knows it, but judging by the way he hooks his fingers into Dean\u2019s belt loops and pulls him in for another kiss (Dean can hear his breath catching when he teases at Cas\u2019s lip with his teeth), Cas knows exactly what he\u2019s trying to say.\n\u00a0\nDinner at The Roadhouse is loud and raucous and just the way Dean loves it, shoveling down his very most favorite kind of burger and his very most favorite beer, with Cas next to him on one side and Jo on the other and Sam and Gabriel and Ash on the other side of the table.\nSam makes fun of him for choosing \u2018Radar Love\u2019 at the jukebox and singing along to the whole thing (it\u2019s a song about a dude who\u2019s in love with his car and Dean can totally relate, so what?) and then Jo puts on REO Speedwagon\u2019s \u2018Can\u2019t Fight This Feeling\u2019, which Dean gags at, but he\u2019s also (sort of) drunk enough to justify singing along to it with her.\nSam, bless him, sets down his drink and mocks a terrible waltz with Jo for a few seconds before passing her off to Dean, and he grabs her and twirls her around, laughing because it\u2019s so fucking goofy and they\u2019re acting like they\u2019re six years old and he loves it. He looks at Cas while Jo\u2019s trying to get her breath back from laughing so hard and Cas is grinning like an idiot, nose crinkling up and everything, and Dean knows he\u2019s never gonna forget that blissed-out look on his face. He grabs himself a beer and sits down next to Cas and he can\u2019t stop smiling when Cas slides a hand onto his knee, warm and solid, and Dean is so fucking tempted to just wrap him up in a hug, right there in the middle of The Roadhouse.\nGabe calls for an afterparty at his place, but everyone groans because it\u2019s a Thursday and all of them have work tomorrow, so Dean and Cas end up heading for the Miltons\u2019 while Gabe bickers with Ellen, one arm slung around a food-coma\u2019d Sam.\nWhen they reach the parking lot, Dean ends up crowding Cas against the Impala, fucking desperate because he\u2019d spent all that time so close to Cas and not doing this, kissing every gasp out of his mouth, curling his hands urgently into his clothes.\nCas pulls away and grins at him, sly and dark like he\u2019s never grinned before, and Dean can\u2019t help lurching forward and kissing him again before Cas gasps that they should really, really get home.\n\u00a0\nDean beats Cas back to his own house and he\u2019s leaning against the Impala as Cas pulls into the driveway, fully prepared to give him a nice ha ha, I beat you speech, but Cas slides out of his car with fucking business on his face and then Dean\u2019s meeting him halfway, pressing their mouths together with an almost embarrassing level of need.\nCas pushes both of them towards the house and follows up when Dean\u2019s back hits the front door, crowding him insistently against it; his mouth is deliciously warm compared to the below-zero air around them, and Dean makes an impatient noise when Cas takes longer than half a second to unlock the door.\nThey make it inside and less than a foot past the door and then Dean\u2019s hands are pushing Cas\u2019s trench coat off and Cas shrugs out of it in one fluid, ridiculously fucking attractive motion before Dean grabs at his shirt and pulls them together again because five seconds without Cas\u2019s mouth on his is a waste of time.\nThey shed clothing with each step, on their way to Cas\u2019s room \u2013 Cas nearly trips, toeing out of his shoes, and Dean has to struggle to unlace his boots \u2013 and the next thing he knows, he\u2019s pushing Cas up against the back of his bedroom door, nudging a knee between his thighs, mouthing a line down his neck. Cas makes this noise and it goes fucking straight down to Dean\u2019s dick and oh, yes, he can definitely dig the way Cas\u2019s fingers knot tightly into his hair.\n\u201cDean,\u201d he pants, \u201cbed.\u201d\nAnd yeah, okay, he\u2019s not gonna argue with that. They gracelessly pull and shove each other across the room, shedding pants, hands grabbing at remaining vestiges of clothing, and then Dean\u2019s slowly unbuttoning Cas\u2019s shirt, mouth following his fingers.\nCas\u2019s stomach is winter-pale, broken by a dark line of coarse hair trailing up from his boxer-briefs, and Dean kisses his way back up to Cas\u2019s heaving chest, bites at a collarbone, makes his way up a thundering carotid when Cas throws his head back.\nAt this rate, neither of them is going to last long.\nCas\u2019s hands insistently pull at his shirt and Dean gratefully strips it off, throwing it onto the floor with the rest of their clothes, then refuses to stop kissing Cas even as he expertly wiggles out of his boxers one-handed. Cas arches up to get rid of his own and christ, Dean\u2019s brain blanks out at the blissful touch of flushed skin against his cock. He swallows Cas\u2019s gasp, bites at his lower lip, falls in love with the way Cas\u2019s fingers dig desperately into his back.\nDean grins at him, breathless, then slides his way back down to Cas\u2019s hips. It\u2019s fucking delicious, the way Cas\u2019s breath catches when he licks a line across one of his hipbones, teases his way down, runs his hands up Cas\u2019s sides.\n\u201cIs this okay?\u201d he breathes, mouth so close to Cas\u2019s dick that he can feel the warmth. Cas snarls and curls a hand into Dean\u2019s hair. He swears he can feel his eyes roll back.\n\u201cFuck, Dean, yes,\u201d he growls, and holy shit, there\u2019s something so filthy about the way Cas\u2019s perfect mouth forms the obscenity that Dean nearly fucking loses it, right then and there.\nHe licks an agonizingly slow stripe up the underside of Cas\u2019s cock and then proceeds to go down like the fucking champ he is. Cas\u2019s breathing goes erratic in under a minute, fingers curling spastically into the sheets, and Dean scrambles his way back up, hips-chest-neck-lips, because he needs this so badly it hurts and Cas is gasping into his mouth and he doesn\u2019t even know whose moans are whose any more.\nCas pushes him over onto his back and follows through, wraps a hand around both of their dicks and expertly finds a rhythm they can both work to. Dean\u2019s short of breath in an embarrassingly short amount of time and oh holy christ he isn\u2019t going to last much longer at all, the way Cas is leaving a stinging line of bites down the side of his neck, the way their sweat is making everything slick and smooth, and then he comes with a hand fisting into dark hair and Cas\u2019s name on his lips. Cas follows him less than a millisecond later, muffling a moan into his shoulder, and Dean\u2019s left seeing stars for a full minute.\nHe presses a kiss into Cas\u2019s sweaty hairline and exhales, long and slow. He definitely can\u2019t remember the last time sex felt this good. Cas hums quietly and kisses Dean, deep and slow and good, then pushes himself up and makes a face at the sticky mess on their stomachs. Dean laughs breathlessly, feeling sixteen all over again as Cas grabs a box of tissues and they clean up.\nDean is fishing around on the ground for his boxers and Cas is running a hand through his hair (and damn, does sex hair look good on him) and they end up staring at each other, wide-eyed in the semi-dark.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Dean says awkwardly.\n\u201cSo,\u201d replies Cas, even and cool.\nDean supposes this is where they have A Talk about whether they\u2019re partners or lovers or any of the other equally-terrible labels that he absolutely hates using and he thinks he\u2019s started panicking because he has no idea how to voice what he wants. He\u2019s never allowed himself to have what he wants; he\u2019s always pushed it away in favor of giving Sammy what he wants, because Sam\u2019s concerns are much more important than his own, and he\u2019s worthless, anyways.\nBut he wants this. God, he wants it.\n\u201cSo I guess...\u201d He gestures at the space between them. Cas levels him with a look and then picks up his boxer-briefs, slides them back on like he\u2019s got all the time in the world.\n\u201cYou\u2019re asking whether I\u2019d like our relationship to move past this fumbling attempt at platitude,\u201d Cas says wryly, mouth turning up at the corner.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Dean says, and snaps his fingers. \u201cThat.\u201d\nHe pulls on his own boxers, just to have something to do with his hands, but he and Cas end up gravitating towards each other and there\u2019s still a huge part of his brain that\u2019s in shocked disbelief even as Cas\u2019s thumbs sweep over his hips.\n\u201cOrdinary friendship never really worked, did it?\u201d murmurs Cas, and their noses touch. Dean snorts.\n\u201cOkay, to be honest \u2013 and don\u2019t laugh at me, Cas \u2013 I always thought you had a thing for Sam,\u201d he manages to say around choked-back laugher. In retrospect, the thought is bafflingly ridiculous and he pulls Cas close, loving the way Cas\u2019s laughter rumbles through his chest and both of them are still flushed and it feels so good to feel Cas\u2019s skin against his.\nSam and Gabe should be home soon and he really, really doesn\u2019t want to get caught naked (again); his t-shirt is next to Cas but he ignores it in favor of kissing him instead, because this is something he could really get used to. He can feel Cas grinning against his mouth and he slides a hand around to the small of his back and right then, the door bangs open.\n\u201cOh, good,\u201d says Gabriel, completely unconcerned, \u201cyou\u2019re not naked. We\u2019re home now, just to let you know.\u201d\n\u201cJesus christ, Gabe!\u201d Dean yells (it\u2019s not a shriek, it\u2019s a yell); Cas looks like he could murder. Gabe just winks and sprints out of the doorway. Dean follows him after throwing a t-shirt over his head and getting his jeans (mostly) on and when he bursts into the kitchen, it\u2019s to the sight of Gabriel and Sam sitting at the table. Sam has his hands neatly folded on the tabletop.\nWell, shit.\nCas bumps into Dean\u2019s shoulder as he races to finish buttoning his shirt; the damage is done, though, because Cas has the most blatantly obvious sex hair ever in the history of getting caught in the act. It doesn\u2019t help that Dean\u2019s shirt is on inside-out, or that their clothes are still strewn incriminatingly across the floor in a line that leads straight from the front door to Cas\u2019s bedroom.\n\u201cSo,\u201d says Sam, and Dean runs through every possible version of I swear I\u2019m not a hypocrite his brain can come up with. \u201cThat took you guys long enough.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d blurts Cas. Sam laughs, a little incredulous, and leans back in his chair.\n\u201cCome on, man,\u201d he says, looking back at Dean, \u201cYou know Bobby thought you guys were, like, a thing, right?\u201d\n\u201cWhat the hell,\u201d Dean sputters.\nGabriel rolls his eyes and tilts the chair back on two legs. Dean\u2019s still scrambling to try and figure out just what the fuck is going on. He keeps expecting Sam to react the same way he did, hurt and angry and confused.\n\u201cYou guys are kind of... immovable object/unstoppable force,\u201d says Sam, wrinkling his nose. \u201cIt was only a matter of time.\u201d\nGabe\u2019s chair legs hit the tile and he snaps his fingers.\n\u201cSpeaking of which,\u201d he crows, \u201cyou owe me twenty bucks, Sam!\u201d\n\u201cHold on a second,\u201d Dean barks. \u201cYou were taking bets?\u201d\nCas crosses his arms; Gabriel shoots them both a huge smirk as Sam sighs and pulls his wallet out.\n\u201cSam bet it\u2019d take you guys till spring break to get your shit together,\u201d he explains, and plucks the twenty-dollar bill out of Sam\u2019s reluctant fingers. \u201cMy money was on the end of the month.\u201d\nDean looks at Cas, incredulous and indignant; Cas just runs a hand through his hair, succeeding only in making it stick up even more.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t this... I don\u2019t know, weird you out?\u201d says Dean, shifting his weight uncomfortably. Because wow, fuck, this is awkward beyond belief \u2013 he\u2019s sort-of-maybe-dating Cas and Sam is Doing Things with Gabriel so it\u2019s all like some sort of creepy not-incestuous boyfriends-in-law thing that Dean is just not going to think about.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d says Gabriel, and Dean\u2019s surprised at how soft his voice is. \u201cHow thick are you? Sam and I have, for serious, been expecting this for weeks now.\u201d Cas\u2019s hand grazes against Dean\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen either of you happier than when you\u2019re around each other.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe days blur into weeks blur into months as the snow melts into slush and Dean and Cas figure how to work around each other, how to stop covering things up and let them be. Dean learns that Cas likes sleeping on the side of the bed closest to the wall and that he doesn\u2019t really snore, and he slowly finds all of the places that make Cas suck in a breath and bite his lip (under his ear, his collarbones, the side of his ribcage, the small of his back \u2013 Dean worships them all).\nHe learns how to drive with a hand on Cas\u2019s knee and that while neither of them are really into PDA, he really likes kissing Cas goodbye if he walks him to his office, right where his jaw slopes up to meet his ear. He also learns to absolutely fucking love the look on Zachariah\u2019s face when he sees the two of them, like he\u2019s smelling something gross and trying not to show it.\nCas, in turn, learns about Dean\u2019s body, about all of his little nicks and scars, finds the place on his left arm where the word \u2018worthless\u2019 is still visible under the black, if he squints; Cas kisses the scarred letters and tells Dean that he\u2019s not, that he deserves to have been saved from Alastair. Dean thinks his heart\u2019s going to burst.\nHe eventually succeeds in caressing all of Dean\u2019s tattoos with those long fingers of his, outlines The Hermit on his back, mouths at Vonnegut\u2019s birdcage on his thigh as Dean\u2019s hands fist into the sheets, digs his fingers into the lines down his side while yanking him closer, traces the pentagram over his heart. Dean tells him about every one of them, sometimes while their sweat\u2019s cooling, sometimes when the morning sunlight paints Cas\u2019s face and makes a bright halo in his hair.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDean\u2019s discovered quickly that Wednesdays are the bane of his existence, because Cas has a night class and a graduate seminar and he usually doesn\u2019t even get to see him until close to ten at night.\nHe\u2019s finishing up wiping down one of the glass cabinets when he hears the bells chime on the side door, and he\u2019s elbow-deep in disinfectant so he doesn\u2019t even bother turning around.\n\"Sorry, man, we're closed, but we open tomorrow at eleven,\" he calls from somewhere in the sink region.\n\"I was hoping you'd make an exception for me.\"\nDean turns around way too fast, dripping more than necessary on the floor, and grins when he sees Cas in the doorway\n\"What're you doing here? I thought you had your discussion thing tonight.\" He watches, confused (but hey, without complaints), as Cas shrugs off his coat and drapes it over one of the couches, then stuffs his hands into the pockets of his slacks, rolls his shoulders, and shrugs.\n\u201cWe got done early,\u201d he says. Dean raises an eyebrow. \u201cWell, fine. One of the syntacticians was doing a dress rehearsal of sorts for presenting her paper, and I decided that, ah, I had more urgent business to take care of.\u201d He wrinkles his nose at \u2018syntactician\u2019 and Dean can feel his mouth twitching up because if there\u2019s one thing he knows about Cas\u2019s studies, it\u2019s that he hates syntax with a passion that almost equals how much he loves dialectology.\n\"Playing hooky to come see me?\" chuckles Dean, amused and enamored.\n\"Actually, I wanted to talk to you about something.\"\nCas\u2019s tone turns serious and Dean sets down his rag with shaking hands.\nHere it comes.\nOf course this couldn't last. Of course things were too good to be true.\nThe second-long pause Cas leaves stretches out like years inside Dean's head as he replays their entire relationship \u2013 their entire friendship \u2013 and tries to figure out where he screwed up. He doesn\u2019t know whether he\u2019s going to vomit or just fucking stop breathing.\nHe decides he went wrong somewhere around the time he was born.\n\"I want a tattoo.\"\nIt takes Dean a good ten seconds to parse that as Cas + want + tattoo and not Cas + want + nothing to do with me.\n\"I\u2013\u201d He swallows past the lump in his throat. \u201cWell, shit, Cas, you know I\u2019m the last person to try and persuade you out of tattoos.\u201d\n\"I want you to do it,\u201d Cas says, dead fucking serious, and pulls a piece of paper out of his pocket. \u201cNow. Tonight.\"\nDean panics.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he croaks, and tries to even out his breathing. It doesn\u2019t work. \u201cNo way, Cas. I can\u2019t.\u201d\nHe can\u2019t, he can\u2019t do this to Cas, not to Cas, because that\u2019s leaving a permanent mark on Cas, on his skin and on his life and oh, fuck, this is rattling through Dean\u2019s fear of commitment (shut up, at least he knows and recognizes that fear) and shaking him to the core, blood running ice-cold. He\u2019s 99% sure he\u2019s having some kind of panic attack right now.\n\u201cWhy not? I have total confidence in you.\u201d\nWell, Dean thinks, that makes one of them.\n\u201cCas\u2013\u201d he starts, but Cas cuts him off almost immediately.\n\u201cThis is something that I\u2019ve wanted for a few years now. I\u2019ve thought it through.\u201d\nHis tone is calm and patient but there\u2019s a glint in his eyes. He came expecting Dean\u2019s resistance and he came prepared, that fucker.\n\u201cLet me see it,\u201d Dean mutters, gesturing towards the paper. Castiel hands it over and Dean unfolds it. It\u2019s a bunch of non-English, non-Roman characters \u2013 not Russian or Arabic or Greek or any of the Asian languages Dean\u2019s familiar with, but simple and with a kind of visual poetry to them. In spite of himself, Dean sorta likes it. Even though he\u2019s got no idea what it is.\n\u201cIt\u2019s my name in Enochian,\u201d says Cas, answering his question, and Dean can hear a quiet note of pride in his voice. \u201cAfter I did some digging on the etymology of my name and came up with Enochian, the idea has been chasing after me.\u201d\n\u201cWell, uh,\u201d Dean mumbles, \u201cI mean, it\u2019s not difficult or anything. Simple stuff like this ends up looking good almost anywhere.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you think so,\u201d Castiel replies, loosening his tie right there in the middle of the shop like this is a thing that\u2019s actually going to happen. \u201cI was thinking the base of my neck, between my shoulder blades, about as big as it is there.\u201d\nHe nods towards the paper and strips his tie off, turning to toss it onto the couch by his coat. As much as Dean generally likes Cas taking off his clothes, this is nowhere near okay.\n\u201cAsh is great with lettering, we can\u2013\u201d\n\u201cDean,\u201d Cas growls, and holy fuck, that\u2019s both terrifying and arousing at the same time. \u201cI want you to do it.\u201d\n\u201cCas\u2013\u201d Dean doesn\u2019t even know where to start. He licks at his lower lip and runs a hand over his face. \u201cYou know I\u2019d\u2013 I\u2019d do anything. For you. Uh.\u201d Wow, shit, way to be articulate, Winchester. \u201cI just\u2013 why\u2019d you have to corner me like this, man?\u201d He lets out a weak laugh.\n\u201cIf I\u2019d asked you would\u2019ve said no,\u201d he answers, and tugs the hem of his shirt out of his pants. The way he does it should definitely be fucking illegal.\nDean swallows hard and squeezes his eyes shut. Something much warmer than fear zooms to the front of his brain when Castiel hitches his shirt up high enough to briefly expose a strip of skin along his stomach.\n\u201cCas, tattooing someone makes\u2013 it runs deep, man, it\u2019s leaving my mark on your skin for the rest of your life.\u201d\nCas raises an eyebrow.\n\u201cYou think I haven\u2019t considered that?\u201d he rumbles, eyes icy. \u201cYou are the only person I would trust with this.\u201d\n\u201cBut this...\u201d He runs a hand through his hair. \u201cThere\u2019s a thing between artist and client, I\u2019m leaving something permanent on you, and\u2013\u201d Dean\u2019s fumbling and he knows it, but he can\u2019t do this to Cas, can\u2019t find the words to explain away the horrifying knot of tension in his chest. When Cas finally decides that he\u2019s had enough of him, the last thing Dean wants is for him to be saddled with a lingering reminder. Cas doesn\u2019t deserve that.\n\u201cThis thing, does it exists with every trendy little sorority girl?\u201d Cas crosses his arms and stands straight, real heat in his tone now as he watches Dean shift nervously.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Dean insists, \u201cof course not. But\u2013\u201d\n\u201cDid it exist with that pair of newlyweds who wanted their initials on each other\u2019s wrists?\u201d\nCas pushes on, rounding the counter that Dean had been so glad to keep between them, steps right up into Dean\u2019s space until all he can see are steel-blue eyes and a set jaw.\n\u201cYeah, but Cas, newly\u2013\u201d\n\u201cDean.\u201d\nCas stops him cold with one word and a look. Dean tries to take a step back but he\u2019s out of room; something clinks on the shelf behind him and he glances up and back, but the stony seriousness is still on Cas\u2019s face.\n\u201cWhat about Sam?\u201d\nSilence reigns.\nSam. If he\u2019s honest with himself, tattooing Sam had probably been what had pulled him out of the horrifying slump-slash-actual-depression after Alastair \u2013 even after he\u2019d started tattooing here, after he\u2019d started at the old shop with Crowley, there\u2019d been something broken in him. Seeing the trust in his brother\u2019s face, though, that\u2019s something he\u2019ll never forget.\nIt\u2019s the same thing that\u2019s all over Cas\u2019s face.\n\u201cNo, there was no thing with them,\u201d Dean admits under his breath. \u201cNot like this.\u201d\n\u201cThen you admit that your reluctance is not entirely due to your sense of professionalism.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s me putting a permanent mark on you!\u201d Dean says, loud enough to fill the little shop, but Cas doesn\u2019t even flinch. Dean can feel the echo of old scars on his left arm. Worthless. \u201cYou don\u2019t want that, Cas. Don\u2019t ask me again.\u201d\n\u201cDean,\u201d Cas says softly, reaching out to touch Dean\u2019s arm, \u201cdid it ever occur to you that that\u2019s exactly why I want you to do it?\u201d Dean tries to look away \u2013 he can\u2019t face this, he literally can\u2019t face this \u2013 but Cas catches him with a hand on the side of his face. \u201cDean. I trust you completely, and you know that. This is what I want.\u201d\nAll the anger drains out of Cas\u2019s voice until there\u2019s nothing but quiet reassurance there; he\u2019s practically pleading and it hits a spot in Dean\u2019s core that\u2019s usually reserved for Sam. Dean keeps trying to look at Cas in the eyes but he ends up moving from eyes to mouth to jaw back to eyes and, finally, he exhales the breath he\u2019s been holding.\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\nCas leans in and kisses him, soft and slow and lingering, and Dean lets himself quietly think that maybe he\u2019s made the right decision.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he repeats, murmured against Cas\u2019s mouth, and runs a hand up his back. \u201cI\u2019ll, uh... yeah. I need to prep some stuff.\u201d\nHe kisses Cas again, briefly, and then walks into his room. Cas seems to realize that he needs some time because he doesn\u2019t follow; Dean takes a couple of seconds to hyperventilate, grips the edge of the counter with shaking hands \u2013 he breathes in, out, in, out, closes his eyes, takes one more long breath, and lets it out slowly. His hands are still shaking when he starts re-disinfecting all of his equipment but, for some reason, he finds himself calming down when Cas walks in.\nOnce everything has been meticulously sanitized, Dean drifts his way to Cas, hands coming up to slowly unbutton his shirt. Everything feels slightly surreal; Cas leans gently into him, one hand sliding under the hem of his t-shirt. When Dean finally reaches the last button, Cas shrugs out of his shirt, slim shoulders rippling.\n\u201cDean,\u201d he says quietly, \u201cthank you.\u201d Dean kisses him again because he can\u2019t find words, communicates everything with his mouth instead, swiping a tongue over his bottom lip, exhaling softly.\n\u201cReady?\u201d\nCas takes a deep breath and nods. Dean runs his hands over Cas\u2019s shoulders, down his back, mouths over a knot of spine, before prepping the skin and laying the transfer paper over. He makes Cas nitpick at the placement for about ten minutes before asking him another seven times whether he\u2019s positive that he wants this, if he\u2019s absolutely sure this is where he wants it.\nFinally, he gets up and shuffles through the abridged collection of records he keeps in the shop. He\u2019s got one of those weirdo, old-school record players that can play both the A-side and the B-side since they\u2019re upright \u2013 he\u2019d found it ages ago at a thrift store, covered in dust and barely functional, and he\u2019d fixed it up himself in that year he\u2019d spent at Bobby\u2019s. He decides on Kansas\u2019s Leftoverture tonight, since it\u2019s kinda been a while.\nIt takes everything he has to will his hands not to shake when Cas sits down on the stool in front of him. The Enochian symbols are a stark, ghostly blue on his skin; Dean runs a gloved hand down Cas\u2019s neck, across his shoulder.\n\u201cThis is gonna hurt,\u201d he whispers. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nSix words he says to every single client, every single time, since the day he left New Orleans.\nCas turns his head, just enough to look at Dean out of the corner of his eye. His expression is soft.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Dean,\u201d he says softly. \u201cI have faith in you.\u201d\nEight words he\u2019s never heard before.\nEight words that shake the foundations of his life, rattle him hard enough to clear the rubble, just enough for everything to finally fall into place.\nThe gun buzzes in his hand and the first line comes out cleaner than ever, dark and sharp against Cas\u2019s skin. Cas is totally relaxed and oh, it does wonders for Dean\u2019s nerves. He feels Cas\u2019s hand slide onto his knee and he wishes he could actually press himself close against Cas\u2019s back; he can feel Cas humming along to \u2018Carry On Wayward Son\u2019 under his hands.\nDean loses himself in the rhythm of ink and art and music, and he thinks about the road he\u2019s driven so far.\nHe\u2019s never liked the idea of fate and predestination. He\u2019s a pretty big fan of Do What You Want and, honestly, it works. He\u2019s never tried to walk some imaginary path set in front of him \u2013 he\u2019s just always done what\u2019s best for Sam, what\u2019s best for them and, sometimes, what\u2019s best for him. If he hadn\u2019t made shitty choices (well, okay, double-edged sword \u2013 most of his shitty choices involved shit for him and a better life for Sam, and no regrets) then he never would\u2019ve learned.\nLife sucked for him for a long time. This profession has changed his life so much, for the worse and for the better and now for the best \u2013 the evidence of how honestly incredible his life is sits and lives and breathes underneath his fingertips and he asks this monumental, incredible thing of Dean, and Dean can make him happy. Dean can give Cas what he wants and he can make Cas happy.\nWithout having suffered through Alastair, without having lived away from Sam for four years and without having met Crowley and Gabriel and without this shop, he would\u2019ve never been able to get past Alastair and he never would\u2019ve tattooed Sam or been able to improve his work or get closer to the Harvelles (Ash included, he\u2019s practically a Harvelle) and he\u2019d never have met Cas. Or... fallen for him. Fallen for him, Dean thinks again, firmly, because that\u2019s an acceptably neutral phrase that omits a lot of feelings-stuff he\u2019s not prepared to deal with yet. He wouldn\u2019t change a thing, if it means he wouldn\u2019t have met Cas.\nConsidering a life without Cas is like a punch to the gut. It\u2019s so coldly horrifying that he instantly shoves the thought away and concentrates instead on the warmth under his fingers and the steady rise and fall as Cas breathes.\n\u201cCas?\u201d\n\u201cHmm?\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he murmurs, barely audible, and he can hear his voice break slightly. The hand on his knee tightens in response.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCas\u2019s tattoo heals beautifully, not to toot his own horn. It looks great on him and Dean feels a vain sense of pride every time he gets the chance to run his fingers over it because even though the thought of his mark being on Cas\u2019s skin is still scary, if he\u2019s honest with himself, he kinda loves that he\u2019s a part of Cas. In a totally non-girly way.\nBusiness booms for Dean. Ever since the expo, Ash says, the number of hits on their website-slash-blog has been growing exponentially, and Dean usually gets at least one email a day asking for a consult. His wait list starts dipping into the next year. According to Ash, his name is getting pretty big in the mod community (which fucking astounds him) and when he dazedly tells Cas, Cas tells him that of course he\u2019s getting well-known, of course he deserves this.\nSam and Cas get more and more stressed as spring break creeps up on them, but then Sam suggests spending those two weeks in South Dakota with Bobby and it takes all Dean has to actually wait for Sam and Cas to finish up their last day before break, instead of peeling out the second Sam says hey, let\u2019s visit Bobby.\nIt\u2019s been ages since he last visited South Dakota (the last time was Sam\u2019s high school graduation \u2013 he wasn\u2019t gonna miss that for the world) and driving, taking his baby halfway across the country, through miles and miles of nothing and cracked roads, he\u2019s already itching to leave. Lord, I was born a ramblin\u2019 man, springs to the front of his thoughts, and the Allman Brothers tell it like it is. Dean always feels twitchy if he doesn\u2019t take at least a four-hour drive twice a month or so, so the prospect of a twenty-hour, thousand-mile drive to Bobby\u2019s is heaven on wheels.\nCas and Gabriel are on board immediately when Sam tells them; Cas positively salivates at the thought of going to a dialect area he\u2019s never been to and Dean is really excited because not only is he going on a road trip, he\u2019s going on a road trip to see Bobby, and he\u2019s going on a road trip with Sam and Cas and Gabe to see Bobby.\nWeirdly, as they\u2019re packing up the Impala, Dean remembers what Sam had told him on his birthday, all those months ago \u2013 that Bobby had actually thought there was a thing between him and Cas over Christmas. Bobby, of all people. Gruff, sure-footed, no-nonsense Bobby had pulled Dean aside and essentially told him to keep Cas close.\nWell, he\u2019s sure as hell been following that advice.\nThey plan for an overnight stop in Chicago and leave on a rainy Saturday morning; as Dean watches the view slip from urban to countryside to city to suburbs to farmland, he realizes how absolutely, unbelievably happy he is.\nHe\u2019s still scared \u2013 god, he\u2019s scared, scared of what this means and what he feels \u2013 but things are right with Cas in a way things have never been right before; Cas blows through all of his careful walls like they don\u2019t even exist and he sees everything ugly that\u2019s in him and stays, not in spite of it but because of it, becomes a part of his family because he wants to be, not because he was born into it. It\u2019s terrifying.\nHe\u2019s still scared, but as they\u2019re nine hours into the drive to Bobby\u2019s place \u2013 the radio\u2019s singing that a gathering of angels appeared above my head, they sang to me a song of hope and this is what they said \u2013 Dean looks at Sam and Gabriel in the rearview mirror, sprawled out and dead asleep, looks at Cas, head resting against the passenger-side window and fingers curled loosely between Dean\u2019s, and he thinks that it\u2019s okay to be scared.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nEPILOGUE\n[six years later]\n\u00a0\n\u201cReally, Castiel, I\u2019m so happy for you,\u201d says Kathleen, smile wavering and eyes bright with tears. \u201cThis is amazing.\u201d Cas has to fight his own grin back.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he says, and puts a hand on her shoulder. \u201cI need to get to my office, though, if you\u2019ll excuse me.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, of course,\u201d she says, and sniffles before pulling him into a quick hug. He adjusts his bag and heads down the hallway, where it\u2019s apparent that Raul has already shared the news with absolutely everyone, since he\u2019s interrupted at least four times by a Professor Milton, congratulations!\nHe finally makes it to his office, shrugs off his coat, drapes it over the back of his chair. He\u2019s barely got time to take a sip of coffee before his lanky TA for American Dialects bursts through the doorway, glasses askew.\n\u201cIs it true?\u201d he blurts out, practically shaking with excitement. Cas smiles at him. \u201cC\u2019mon, Professor, is everyone pulling my leg or is it legit?\u201d\nIn answer, Castiel holds up his left hand, where a wide silver band glints from around his ring finger."
