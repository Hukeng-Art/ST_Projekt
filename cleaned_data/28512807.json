    "text": "Cindy Moon thinks she knows weird.\u00a0\nNew York has always been a little strange on its own\u2014there\u2019s a reason it\u2019s so well known despite the general vastness that is the entirety of America. Still, the rise of superheroes and supervillains when she was a little girl had been a punch in the face. Aliens had been more of a straight-up knockout at the time. The Avengers formed and, yeah, that has been somewhat of a wild ride because now there is always\u00a0something happening in New York. Still, those somethings are usually handled by at least one of the wayward superheroes who now live in the city she calls home.\u00a0\nUntil they weren\u2019t. Like half the population of the universe, she just up and died for about five years before they were suddenly resurrected and thrown into a world that they didn\u2019t really belong to anymore. If aliens were a knock-out, she's not quite sure how she'd describe the previous months of absolute anarchy.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s alright, though, because eventually everything calmed down and life is back to its normal amount of weird. Social media is currently bopping\u00a0because she (like half the population) had missed five years\u2019 worth of memes and are desperate to learn. Even now, eight months later, she still hasn\u2019t caught up totally. She still goes to school in the morning. She says hello to the friends that were blipped with her (and says goodbye to the ones that weren't). There are other happier things, too, like that time she caught Spider-Man on the rooftop singing some offbeat pop song. He spent the better part of an hour desperately trying to get her to delete the shaky video she took while trying not to laugh.\u00a0\n(She posted it anyway. It had almost half a million views by the time the week was over.)\u00a0\u00a0\nSo, yeah, Cindy is pretty confident she knows weird.\u00a0\nYou can imagine her reaction when the quarantine started.\u00a0\nNo one is quite sure what caused it, exactly. Cindy had spent late nights on google like any other reasonable person trying to find an answer for why all of New York and most of the east coast has to be locked up in their homes for the foreseeable future. There no certified answer, really, but Cindy can pretty safely assume it\u2019s probably something supervillain-related. That, or it\u2019s aliens again.\u00a0\n(She really, really hopes it\u2019s not aliens.)\u00a0\nThe reason doesn\u2019t change the outcome. Work and schools close. No one is allowed to leave their homes or apartments. Teachers spend exactly a week setting up online classes, and Cindy very much enjoys that break, before she\u2019s forced to attend first-period chemistry at exactly seven-thirty in the morning online.\u00a0If that isn\u2019t enough to certify a horrifying start to her day, then the mandatory \u2018video cameras on at all times\u2019 rule certainly would.\u00a0\nBut that\u2019s all fine. It\u2019s whatever. Video cameras on at seven-thirty for online classes might really\u00a0suck,\u00a0but there are some exciting things about it too. Mainly, Cindy can now confirm her theory about how Suzan hasn\u2019t outgrown her middle school horse girl phase given the number of horse pictures still hanging up on her furthest wall. Or there\u2019s that fact that Flash\u2019s apartment is always strangely empty and startlingly clean despite being so absurdly big and nice. Or that Abe\u2019s bunsen burner collection next to his bed makes him a nerd\u00a0with a capital N.\u00a0\nSo, it\u2019s not all bad. She\u2019s known her classmates (or, at least, she's known half of her classmates) since they were all young, but even she has never really interacted with them in a situation like this. Being stuck in quarantine with everyone else lets her see just a little bit closer into everyone\u2019s lives.\nThis all leads back to the most crucial point\u2014Cindy Moon knows weird. And Peter Parker? Yeah, Peter Parker is\u00a0weird.\u00a0\nPeter\u2019s life is no mystery to most of Midtown School of Science and Technology. Especially not to Cindy, who\u2019s known him since they were both toddlers in the same preschool. He\u2019s not exactly subtle in any way, either. She knows about how he lives with his aunt in Queens, and, subsequently, his uncle\u2019s untimely and incredibly devastating death. She knows how he\u2019s a nerd that likes school, how he wears science pun t-shirts every other day, and how he\u2019s just about as close to a teacher\u2019s pet as you can get while being the school\u2019s greatest genius slacker.\u00a0\nShe also knows that he mysteriously got jacked their freshman year of high school, and no one could ever explain why. Something happened, then, because he quit a lot of their shared activities. Robotics club had been the first causality, but it doesn't stop there. He started getting into furious whispered conversations with Ned more frequently in the hallways when they both thought no one was there. He started skipping decathlon practice not long after, which was perhaps the most startling given how dedicated he had been to decathlon previously. Sometimes he comes in with a limp or sloppily done makeup to cover up a bruise, only for it to disappear the next day. Cindy is also pretty certain\u00a0she isn\u2019t making up the time, right before the blip, that Peter had seemingly disappeared off a\u00a0moving bus\u00a0right as the aliens started attacking.\u00a0\nPeter Park is weird. This isn\u2019t new.\u00a0\nHowever, what really ties this all together is that Cindy might not know everything about Peter Parker, but even she\u2019s fairly convinced his little apartment in Queens is not supposed to look like a log cabin disguised as a mansion. Yet, every morning when she logs onto Zoom for their shared seven-thirty chemistry class, Cindy can definitely make out the beautiful finishes of a massive kitchen with beautifully crafted wood cabinets and a stunning view of the lake through the kitchen window. If Cindy\u2019s paying attention enough, sometimes she catches the blurry image of a toddler running around at seemingly random intervals.\u00a0\nFlash is convinced he\u2019s using a background filter to make himself seem cooler. Cindy is not so sure.\u00a0\nIt takes another week of Zoom University, but the reality of the situation comes crashing down in perhaps the most spectacular fashion. Cindy\u2019s seen a lot of soap operas and medical dramas recently, but absolutely nothing compares to the glorious spectacle that is Peter Parker\u2019s life.\u00a0\nLike most of this weird form of a quarantine adventure, it starts in the regular seven-thirty AM Zoom chemistry class. There\u2019s nothing specifically remarkable about this chemistry period\u2014the most interesting thing so far is how fast the majority of the class had forgone any sense of getting ready in the morning. Even Brad Davis, who has been trying to impress MJ for the better part of the year, did nothing more than roll over and turn on his camera when asked. Cindy herself barely makes it to her desk in her PJs in time for class to start. It\u2019s only MJ, who somehow manages to get up at the ass crack of dawn every morning and still manages to look perfect in time for class, and Peter, who\u2019s still sitting in that picaresque kitchen, that even try to look like they\u2019re ready for the day.\u00a0\nMr. Cobbwell commented on it the first couple of days to get them a little more motivated to be presentable. Now, even he looks like he\u2019s barely holding it all together. It\u2019s truly remarkable how a single Zoom class can expose man's fallacies in such a blatant and brutal manner.\u00a0\u00a0\nSo life continues on. The first part of the class is normal\u2014Cindy's not quite sure what they're learning about but she'll probably figure it out by the time the second test rolls around. Then the toddler runs behind Peter Parker\u2019s screen.\nThat in itself isn\u2019t wholly unusual. Cindy\u2019s not quite sure where Peter is, exactly, but the toddler isn\u2019t anything she hasn\u2019t seen before. In fact, the toddler has made quite a few (adorable) appearances over the last two weeks. The most notable one being the time she ran screaming behind Peter while Peter had been asking a question and Peter never once batted an eye.\u00a0\nThis time, it\u2019s the man that comes running in after her that gives Cindy pause. He scoops her up and says something that Cindy can\u2019t hear due to the mandatory mute rule that Mr. Cobbwell had imposed on them last week after someone\u2019s parents got into a screaming match (swearing and all) halfway through the lecture. He holds her on his hip, kisses her forehead, and almost immediately zeroes in on Peter's computer screen.\u00a0\nThis man isn\u2019t someone Cindy recognizes right away despite the ringing familiarity in her head. She squints, trying to figure out where she\u2019s seen this man and his toddler before and\u00a0why\u00a0Peter is in this man\u2019s house and/or why this man is in Peter\u2019s house.\u00a0\nThe man turns around to face the camera\u2014arm full of toddler and everything\u2014and Cindy finally makes out the fashionable goatee, oil-stained t-shirt, and\u00a0actual arc reactor in his chest\u00a0before she makes the connection and bites one her tongue to keep from shouting in surprise.\u00a0\n\n No way.\u00a0 \n\nShe\u2019s not the only one who\u2019s noticed, either. Mr. Cobbwell (bless his soul) is still droning on about moles or something equally unimportant. The rest of the class, though? Yeah, the rest of the class has noticed if the wide-eyed looks and subtle glances in the direction of Peter\u2019s screen are anything to go by. The tension on the Zoom call is almost palpable.\u00a0\nPeter himself remains blissfully unaware of the entire situation. Cindy wants to scream.\u00a0\u00a0\n Absolutely no fucking way .\u00a0\nThe man\u2014Cindy doesn\u2019t want to call him who she thinks he really is because it makes absolutely\u00a0no sense\u00a0for\u00a0that man\u00a0to be in Peter Parker\u2019s home\u2014doesn\u2019t stay for very long. He ends up wandering out of the camera\u2019s sight not thirty seconds later\u2014she\u2019s not quite sure, but she thinks he might\u2019ve winked before he left too. More than half the class has definitely taken a screenshot by this point. Herself included in this list.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s almost agonizing, having to sit in her uncomfortable desk chair and not say a word. It\u2019s not like she can unmute herself and start what will definitely be the wildest Zoom class fight of the twenty-first century. Mr. Cobbwell probably wouldn\u2019t appreciate her interrupting his stoichiometry equations, the mystery of the Tony Stark lookalike or not.\u00a0 \u00a0\nShe doesn\u2019t have to wait for long, though. Whatever stars are smiling down upon her, Mr. Cobbwell ends up being forced to take an emergency phone call. Cindy bides her time until the exact moment that Mr. Cobbwell had muted himself and walked away off-screen before she furiously unmutes herself.\u00a0\n\u201cPeter fucking Parker,\u201d she says. Peter\u2019s head snaps up so fast that it almost looks inhuman. \u201cDid Tony Stark just waltz in and pick up his child in the background of your Zoom call?\u201d\u00a0\nPeter freezes. Wide-eyed, with \u2018guilty\u2019 written on his forehead in 72, bold, Times New Roman font. It takes a solid thirty seconds before he can put himself together enough to click the unmute button.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2014no?\u201d Peter says. His voice is startlingly high pitched, and his expression is nothing short of horrified.\u00a0\nDamn, if that isn\u2019t anything but a confession.\u00a0\nThere\u2019s a voice in the background that\u2019s too garbled to make out, but Peter quickly mutes himself and turns his camera off despite the mandatory camera-on rule that had been in place for the entirety of the founding of Zoom university. Two messages come through the Zoom chat before Cindy has the chance to wrap her head around the entire transpired interaction.\n [Peter Parker]:  Sorry, Mr. Cobbwell. My mic and video aren\u2019t working.\u00a0\n [Peter Parker]: I think I have a bad connection.\nCindy\u2019s not the only one who finds this bullshit if the look on Flash\u2019s face, in particular, is anything to go by. The rest of the class simply watches this entire interaction with wide eyes. Considering this is the most interesting thing to happen to most of them in the last two weeks, Cindy can\u2019t really bring it in herself to blame them.\u00a0\n\u201cPeter,\u201d Cindy says, loudly. \u201cJust because you muted yourself doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t hear me. What the\u00a0hell\u00a0was that?\u201d\u00a0\nThere\u2019s no answer. Not even a chat message comes through.\u00a0\nCindy\u2019s about to rip into him again, peanut gallery and all, when Mr. Cobbwell decides to make the most inopportune appearance in the history of teachers walking into classrooms at bad times. Truthfully, this one would go right up there on the top of a compilation of worst teacher entries.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat happened to Peter?\u201d Mr. Cobbwell says. He reads the messages in the class Zoom chat. \u201cOh, that\u2019s unfortunate. Peter, let me know if you need any help or continue having trouble before the next class.\u201d\n [Peter Parker]: I will. Thanks!\u00a0\nCindy doesn\u2019t get the chance to wring more answers out of Peter before the class period ends. He\u2019s the first one to leave, lack of camera appearance and all. Cindy logs into her next class confused, and frustrated, and oddly excited all at once.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe next morning, Cindy is the first person to log onto the Zoom call for first-period chemistry.\u00a0\nShe\u2019s not the only one who has this idea. By the time seven am rolls around\u2014a full thirty minutes before class is even set to begin\u2014over half the class is in the Zoom call. It\u2019s no secret that Peter liked to join Zoom calls early, and everyone\u2019s more than a little curious after the events of yesterday morning.\u00a0\nLike clockwork, Peter joins with his camera working at exactly seven-fifteen. He takes one look at the almost-full meeting, does a double take, and scrambles for something on his computer.\u00a0\u00a0\nCindy narrows her eyes. \u201cPeter, if you leave this Zoom call, I\u2019ll have MJ eject you from the decathlon team.\u201d\n\u201cMJ wouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d Peter says but he doesn\u2019t sound so sure.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cThat all depends on how convincing her argument is,\u201d MJ says. Her camera isn\u2019t even on.\u00a0\nThe look Peter gives her is so full of betrayal that Cindy almost wonders why he isn\u2019t on the acting team.\u00a0\n(Then she remembers that Peter has commitment issues on a good day and, well, acting has never really been his thing. He can\u2019t even lie with a straight face, and considering most of what comes out of his mouth this day and age is a lie, it's probably for the best that the idea is never considered again.)\u00a0\n\u201cWhy are we even here? It\u2019s a background,\u201d Flash insists. \u201cHe just coded it or something for attention.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cFlash, shut up,\u201d Suzan says.\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, okay, Flash. Why\u00a0are\u00a0you even here if you think it\u2019s a background?\u201d Cindy shoots right back, full of adrenaline from the Tony Stark-shaped mystery that\u2019s being hung above all of their heads.\u00a0\n\u201cNo, no, no. Flash is right,\u201d Peter says immediately. \u201cIt\u2019s a background. I had Ned help me code it and everything.\u201d\nNed\u2019s in the meeting, but his camera is off, and his mic is muted. Cindy gives Ned a moment to speak up and confirm but there\u2019s not even a twitch. Cindy turns her pointed look back to Peter.\u00a0\n\u201cI said,\u201d Peter says louder. He subtly glances in the direction of the list of names currently in the meeting, \u201cThat I coded that background with Ned!\u201d\u00a0\nNed doesn\u2019t come on to confirm or deny. If the look Peter is sending the Zoom call is any indication, he knows that there will be no help from that corner of the room. Either Ned is watching this all go down with popcorn in his hand like the rest of the class, or Ned is AWOL and won\u2019t be returning in time to save his best friend from getting his ass absolutely grilled.\u00a0\n\u201cRight,\u201d Cindy says dryly. \u201cPeter, you are the worst liar in this entire class.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s a coded background,\u201d Peter insists. \u201cThat\u2019s all it is. It\u2019s a coded background.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not a coded background.\u00a0\nPeter doesn\u2019t log on early the next day. In fact, he logs on a full five minutes late and gets a snide remark from Mr. Cobbwell for his efforts. His camera is on, at least, and Cindy knows he sees her glare if his paling face is anything to go by.\u00a0\n I will find out, she mouths at him.\u00a0\nShe\u2019s pretty sure he doesn\u2019t understand the exact words she said, but her vibes are not hard to guess. He gives her a wide-eyed stare and shakes his head in defiance.\u00a0\nWell. No one can say that Cindy never liked a challenge.\u00a0\nThis time, though, she doesn\u2019t even have to wait until the end of the class period to get more information. Peter does that all for her.\u00a0\nPeter\u2019s unmuted. He had just finished giving Mr. Cobbwell a (correct) answer to the latest chemistry question when there is a\u00a0thunk\u00a0sound from his side of the line. Peter glances up, seeing something that isn\u2019t in the camera\u2019s line of sight, and his expression drops so fast that Cindy\u2019s not convinced he\u2019s seen a ghost.\u00a0\n\u201cWho is that?\u201d a voice says. It sounds strikingly familiar. \u201cPeter, are you chatting with your school friends?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d Peter whispers in poorly disguised horror.\u00a0\n\u201cWell, well, well,\u201d the voice says and, oh god, it\u2019s\u00a0so familiar. \u201cWhat do we have here?\u201d\nPeter lunges for his computer. He turns off his camera and mutes himself before Cindy can even think of a proper response. There\u2019s silence in the Zoom call. Even Mr. Cobbwell can\u2019t find it in himself to reign in the class and break the absolute grappling stillness that is currently holding the entire first-period chemistry class.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s all of thirty seconds before Peter\u2019s camera flicks back on. This time, he isn\u2019t alone.\u00a0\nCindy might have thought about it, and she\u2019s reasonably convinced that she\u2019s right about the entire situation, but truthfully nothing could prepare her for the emotional whiplash upon seeing The Anthony Edward Stark pulling up a chair at the beautifully carved wooden table and plopping in a seat directly next to a red-faced Peter Parker.\u00a0\nTony Stark takes it all in\u2014the leftover Zoom chats from those kids that don\u2019t want to unmute themselves to ask a question, the half-finished equations written on Mr. Cobbwell\u2019s shared screen, and the twenty-something high school kids staring at him with a combination of confusion and awe.\u00a0\n\u201cGood morning to Peter\u2019s class and friends,\u201d The Tony Stark says. Peter\u2019s face seems to get redder and redder. \u201cWhat a wonderful day to continue the education of the youths.\u201d\u00a0\nNed turns on his camera and unmutes his mic. \u201cHi, Mr. Stark, sir!\"\n\u201cHi, Ted,\u201d Mr. Stark says. \u201cGood to see you again.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOhmygodMr.Starkalmostknowsmyname\u2014\"\nPeter buries his head and lets out the world's most pathetic whining noise.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2014,\u201d Mr. Cobbwell stutters out. \u201cMr. Stark, what are you doing\u2026here?\u201d\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a very eloquent way of asking\u00a0why the hell are you in the house of one of my students?\u00a0Cindy has to give him props for not being a stuttering mess. She\u2019s not quite sure she could form actual words currently, even if she tries.\u00a0\n\u201cI love disrupting important conversations,\u201d Mr. Stark says. \u201cAnd I was curious to see what Peter here was doing at so early in the morning. So, what\u2019s on the lesson plan today?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWell,\u201d Mr. Cobbwell says. What\u2019s he going to do, tell the Tony Stark to\u00a0leave? No sane person would even try. \u201cToday, we are working on balancing equations.\u201d\u00a0\nMr. Stark ignores Peter very obviously pushing on his shoulder. \u201cAh, basic stoichiometry. I would say I\u2019m rather adept at that, right, Peter?\u201d\n\u201cNot really,\" Peter says.\nThe Zoom chat starts blowing up. No one wants to verbally get in the middle of what is possibly the most interesting thing to ever happen to them. This is including the time where half the population died for five years.\u00a0\n [Abe Brown]: can someone PLEASE explain whats going on\n [Zach Cooper]: honestly dude if any of us knew i think we would tell you\n\u00a0\u201cRight,\u201d Mr. Stark says. He stands up and lets himself be pushed a little further away by Peter. \u201cI have to do other things right now\u2014very important work things that pertain to the safety of the universe and whatnot\u2014\"\n\u201cMr. Stark, you\u2019re retired,\u201d Peter says.\u00a0\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re in class. Anyway, feel free to send me an email if you ever want a guest lecturer. Well, send Peter an email and I\u2019ll respond through that. Probably.\u201d\n [Betty Brant]: does this mean peter was telling the truth about the internship?\u00a0\n [Sally Avril]: whos gonna tell flash\n [Flash Thompson]: shut up. i can read\n [Sue Lorman]: what are your current feeling, flash?\n [Sue Lorman]: \u2026.flash you there?\n [Sue Lorman]: you know we can see you camera on right\n [Sue Lorman]: ope he turned if off lmao\nMr. Cobbwell gaps, unable to come up with a proper response. Peter\u2019s looking somewhere off-camera with desperation bleeding into his expression.\u00a0\n\u201cMrs. Potts,\u201d Peter says. His voice pitched upwards, almost as if he were whining to Pepper Potts, which of course, Cindy thought of as ridiculous. After all, common sense dictates that no one would ever whine to\u00a0the\u00a0Pepper Potts.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Peter,\u201d a voice says off-screen and, yeah, Cindy has seen enough of the #1 woman CEO\u2019s interviews to be able to recognize her voice. \u201cBut you and I both know that it was only a matter of time before he made an appearance.\u201d\u00a0\nPeter puts his head back in his hands and looks like the picture perfect definition of someone how has tried to fight with the logic of the universe and lost spectacularly. Ms. Potts steps into the view of the camera for the firt time, just as beautiful and as striking as every interview Cindy has managed to get her grubby hands on.\u00a0\n\u201cTony,\u201d Ms. Potts says. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go get Morgan some breakfast?\u201d\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not a suggestion. Mr. Stark doesn\u2019t take it as a suggestion either. He gets up so quickly that it\u2019s almost like he had never been there to begin with.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll sort this out,\u201d Ms. Potts tells Peter. Then, to the rest of the class, \u201cI\u2019m incredibly sorry for my husband\u2019s disruption. I\u2019ll make sure he doesn\u2019t interrupt further so you can finish your class.\u201d\u00a0\nClass had ended almost ten minutes ago and almost everyone will be late for next period, but no one tells her this.\u00a0\nShe leaves them after that\u2014Peter still hasn\u2019t removed his head from his hands, and he doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s about to join the world of the living any time soon. Cindy takes this as the perfect opportunity to maybe-finally figure out the mystery that is Peter Parker and Tony Stark.\u00a0\n(Because as much as she loves being right\u2014and, oh man, this is definitely going on her resume under \u2018amateur detective'\u2014this entire situation only leads to more questions than it does answers. Mainly how the fuck\u00a0does Peter Parker even know Tony Stark? Why is he spending quarentine in that house? How does someone like Peter Parker even get there in the first place?)\u00a0\n [Cindy Moon]: alright which of you has peter\u2019s contact info because We Need To Chat\n [Peter Parker]: we really don\u2019t\n [Ned Leeds]:\u00a0i have it\n [Peter Parker]: ned.\n [Peter Parker]: ned don\u2019t you dare\n [Sue Lorman]:\u00a0guys this is the class zoom chat\n [Sue Lorman]: everyone can see these messages\nShe almost forgets Mr. Cobbwell is still in the meeting, so you can imagine her surprise when she looks up to see him reading the Zoom chat.\u00a0\nMr. Cobbwell closes his eyes with a sigh and says, \u201cI think that we will end the lesson there for today.\u201d\u00a0\n[Cindy Moon]:\u00a0sweet\n [Cindy Moon]: hmu if you want to be added to this new\n [Cindy Moon]: hmmmm\n [Cindy Moon]: lets call it a study group that im making\nHalf the class joins within fifteen minutes of Cindy making it. She\u2019s never been so proud in her life.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCindy Moon\u00a0has added\u00a0Peter Parker\u00a0to\u00a0Explanation Station\n[Peter Parker]: oh no\nPeter Parker\u00a0has left\u00a0Explanation Station\u00a0\n[Cindy Moon]: no you dont\nCindy Moon\u00a0has added\u00a0Peter Parker\u00a0to\u00a0Explanation Station\n[Peter Parker]: please dont do this to me\n[Cindy Moon]: you brought this upon yourself\u00a0\n[Michelle Jones]: spill, parker\n[Peter Parker]: mj you literally already know\n[Michelle Jones]: i mean, yeah, but i really like watching you squirm\n[Peter Parker]: why are you and i friends again\n[Michelle Jones]: i don\u2019t know, loser. why are we?\n[Ned Leeds]: because peter thinks youre really cool\n[Peter Parker]: ned i love you but i am actually going to toss you into the hudson river one of these days\n[Ned Leeds]: :(\n[Flash Thompson]: this is literally disgusting\u00a0\n[Michelle Jones]: Then Leave\n[Peter Parker]: you know for a sec i completely forgot about this entire chat\n[Peter Parker]: so im just gonna,,,,\nPeter Parker\u00a0has left\u00a0Explanation Station\u00a0\nCindy Moon\u00a0has added\u00a0Peter Parker\u00a0to\u00a0Explanation Station\n[Cindy Moon]: bro.\nPeter Parker\u00a0has left\u00a0Explanation Station\u00a0\nCindy Moon\u00a0has added\u00a0Peter Parker\u00a0to\u00a0Explanation Station\n[Cindy Moon]: PETER\nPeter Parker\u00a0has left\u00a0Explanation Station\u00a0\n[Abe Brown]: honestly i don\u2019t know why i expected anything different\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe next day, Cindy is yet again the first person in the Zoom meeting. Yet again, Peter doesn\u2019t show up until some five minutes or so after the 'tardy' bell rings.\u00a0\nUnfortunately for Peter, Mr. Cobbwell is also running late that day so he gets the full brunt of a curious class of twenty or so students who accidentally saw Iron Man on a Zoom call and not once got an answer as to why. Only about a third have their cameras turned on, likely because it\u2019s seven-thirty in the morning and no one actually wants to be here but curiously is a dangerous thing. However, very, very few are muted. It\u2019s as if they\u2019re predicting the argument that is undoubtedly going to take place and are just waiting to jump in like the hungry pack of drama-feeding sharks that they all are.\u00a0\nPeter takes all of ten seconds to notice the silent tension. He yet again freezes on the spot. \u201c\u2026Where is Mr. Cobbwell?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s late,\u201d Suzan says. \u201cLike you are.\u201d\n\u201cOh, great. Uh, I guess I'll be taking my leave\u2014\"\n\u201c\u2014Oh, no, Peter. You are going to sit your little white boy butt down and explain\u00a0why\u00a0Tony Stark and Pepper Potts are in your house,\u201d Cindy pauses and then, \u201cOr are you in their house? Do you even own a house? This is confusing.\u201d\n\u201cWhy would I own a house?\u201d Peter says because of course that\u2019s the part he gets fixated on. \u201cI live right in the middle of Queens.\u201d\n\u201cWell, obviously not right now,\u201d Abe Brown says.\u00a0\nPeter bites his lip and goes silent. Cindy wishes they had class in person so she could wring the answers from him personally.\u00a0\n\u201cPeter,\u201d she says slowly. \u201cThe quicker we get an explanation, the quicker we stop harassing you.\u201d\n\u201cYou could just stop harassing me to begin with and forget about it,\u201d Peter offers helpfully. Some of the class boos. Peter ducks his head and rubs the back of his neck.\u00a0\n\u201cThat's not happening and you know it.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2014ugh, fine.\" Peter doesn\u2019t meet their eyes and instead chooses to fiddle with his notebooks in front of him. Cindy knows this is a lie before it even comes out of his mouth. \u201cI\u2019m, uh, I\u2019m here for my internship?\u201d\nIt comes out more of a question than an actual answer. He still doesn\u2019t meet their eyes. Cindy sends him a look that\u2019s so unimpressed that she can see the exact moment that Peter\u2019s eyes flicker towards the 'leave Zoom meeting' button.\u00a0\n\u201cPeter,\u201d she says. \u201cStark Industries is currently shut down, like the rest of New York, because we are in quarantine. Also, internships don\u2019t usually constitute internees going to their mentor's\u00a0houses\u00a0to attend\u00a0online school.\u00a0So if you are going to lie,\u00a0at least make it believable.\u201d\nPeter gives her a look of utter horror and turns off his camera.\u00a0\n\u201cPeter! You can\u2019t run forever! I know you can still hear me!\u201d\n\u201cI knew it,\u201d Suzan Yang says, quietly.\nThere\u2019s something like muffled laugher that comes from MJ\u2019s computer. Her camera still isn't on.\nPeter is saved by some ungodly force of nature because Mr. Cobbwell takes that exact moment to log into the meeting. Cindy puts on her perfected look of an innocent high schooler and greets her chemistry teacher at ass o\u2019clock in the morning just as she does every day.\u00a0\n(If she sends a particularly vicious look towards the black square labeled 'Peter Parker' at the top of the screen, well, no one can really blame her.)\nPeter never once turns his camera back on.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nExplanation Station\n\n[Jason Ionello]: anyone want to take bets on why peter parker knows tony stark or\n[Flash Thompson]: i still say its fake\n[Betty Brant]: flash the only one youre fooling is yourself\n[Betty Brant]: peter did say he had an internship\u00a0\n[Tyler Corbyn]: are we really going back to the internship thing again\n[Cindy Moon]: weve already debunked the internship theory\n[Sue Lorman]: yeah internship theory died a quite back\n[Betty Brant]: hm. damn i got nothing then\n[Suzan Yang]: i have a theory\n[Betty Brant]: we don't talk about your theory\n[Cindy Moon]: you have said your theory many times in person and i honestly don\u2019t want to think about it at all, ever, so im going to say debunked\u00a0\n[Suzan Yang]: your loss then\n[Zach Cooper]: five bucks on the secret love child theory\n[Brad Davis]: bet\n[Kenneth Lim]: theres no waayyyy lmao could u even imagine\n[Kenneth Lim]: like yikes\n[Sue Lorman]: no, no kenneth shut up i want to hear more about this theory\n[Zach Cooper]: its really quite simple and im sure you can understand it if you read the name \u2018secret lovechild theory\u2019\u00a0\n[Zach Cooper]: where the theory is about a secret lovechild\n[Michelle Jones]: im screenshotting these to send to peter\n[Cindy Moon]: oh right peter said you already knew the reason\n[Cindy Moon]: mj spill challenge\u00a0\n[Michelle Jones]: no thanks\n[Michelle Jones]:\u00a0honestly its more fun watching you guys guess\n[Cindy Moon]: hm alright i guess we need an answer from the source\u00a0\nCindy Moon\u00a0has added\u00a0Peter Parker\u00a0to\u00a0Explanation Station\n[Cindy Moon]: confirm or deny above theory\u00a0\n[Peter Parker]: oh my god\nPeter Parker\u00a0has left\u00a0Explanation Station\n[Abe Brown]: yet again i am not quite sure why i expected something different\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps the most surprising outcome of the entire clusterfuck of a situation is that they\u00a0do\u00a0get something out of it. Of course, it\u2019s not from Peter because Peter is like a steel trap and everything he says only leads to more questions and no answers. Cindy has been trying this for almost a week now. She knows how this goes.\u00a0\nShe isn\u2019t expecting to log on for first-period chemistry like always, only to see The Tony Stark already on the meeting.\u00a0\nShe\u2019s not early this time\u2014she stopped that some three days ago when Peter made it incredibly clear that he wouldn\u2019t show up early anymore either. Instead of wasting thirty minutes of precious sleep, Cindy decides to put her drive towards more obtainable goals like trying to get out of bed instead of trying to grill a person who doesn\u2019t even show up half the time.\u00a0\nMr. Cobbwell is already on too. He seems ecstatic for incredibly obvious reasons. Not many teachers can say that they had Tony Stark guest lecture, after all, even if it is just through Zoom.\u00a0\nHe\u2019s got a little label with 'Tony Stark' and everything. Cindy doesn\u2019t know why she\u2019s surprised that the previous CEO and Iron Man does, in fact, have a Zoom account.\u00a0\n\u201c\u2014I\u2019m sure the students will enjoy whatever you have planned,\u201d Mr. Cobbwell is saying. He checks the timer and startles. \u201cOh! We\u2019re about ready to start. We\u2019re missing a couple students, I think, so we might have a few that log on late. However, you can start whenever you\u2019re ready, Mr. Stark.\u201d\u00a0\nMr. Stark looks at his screen intensely. Then, he stands up from his kitchen table (the same one that Peter has been sitting at. Go figure) and says, \u201cHold on just a moment.\u201d\u00a0\nMr. Stark wanders off-camera just as there\u2019s a crash in the background.\u00a0\n\u201cPeter, you\u2019re supposed to be in class,\u201d Mr. Stark says. It\u2019s muffled, almost impossible to understand, but Cindy\u2019s listening in so intensely that she\u2019s determined to make out every word. \u201cC\u2019mon, kid, Pepper is going to kill me if you skip.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not skipping! I\u2019m just\u2014I\u2019m sick! I\u2019m so sick, Mr. Stark,\u201d Peter\u2019s voice comes through. It\u2019s even more muffled than Mr. Stark\u2019s is. \u201cI\u2019m sorry but I don\u2019t think I can make class today. I\u2019m gonna throw up or something. I\u2019ll just be going back up to my room\u2014\"\nThere\u2019s a sigh. Mr. Stark wanders back into camera view and addresses Mr. Cobbwell and the entire class, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m going to need another moment. Teenagers and all that. I\u2019m sure you understand.\u201d\n\u201cOf course, of course,\u201d Mr. Cobbwell rushes to assure. \u201cTake all the time you need.\u201d\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Mr. Stark says. He turns off his camera and mutes his microphone.\u00a0\nIt doesn\u2019t take long\u2014Cindy\u2019s not counting the time despite being incredibly invested. However, Peter\u00a0does\u00a0log on almost five minutes after the bell should\u2019ve sounded looking distinctly not-sick and incredibly disgruntled. He shoots someone off-screen a look just as Mr. Stark turns his own account\u2019s camera and microphone back on.\u00a0\n\u201cNow then,\u201d Mr. Stark says. \u201cHow about we start this lovely little lesson? High school chemistry is one of my favorite subjects, after all.\"\u00a0\n(Cindy can\u2019t be certain because Peter\u2019s muted, but she\u2019s pretty sure that he gives a little groan when he buries his face in his hands and looks like death personally came to pick him up.)\u00a0\nThe lecture starts. Unfortunately for Cindy and the rest of the class, chemistry isn\u2019t suddenly exciting even when you have a superhero to teach it. It\u2019s still seven-thirty in the morning, they\u2019re still playing the part of innocent Zoom University students, and chemistry itself just really sucks, if she\u2019s completely honest.\u00a0\nTime passes. The class is about to end. Cindy\u00a0does\u00a0manage to learn something even if that something is the fact Peter is not below a couple backhanded comments directed at The Tony Stark. She can\u2019t hear them very well because Peter\u2019s mic is muted but, y\u2019know, Tony Stark is sitting right next to him and his mic definitely\u00a0isn\u2019t\u00a0muted so she gets to hear a couple of gems with the rest of the class. That alone makes this entire thing worth it.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cI would appreciate it if you would all keep this on the down low,\u201d Mr. Stark says right after he had finished his guest lecture on the applications of modern chemistry. It\u2019s possibly the most excited Cindy has seen Peter all week. \u201cPR and all that. I\u2019m sure Pepper could explain more if you wanted her to.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cMr. Cobbwell, are we done?\u201d Peter says suddenly. \u201cI have another class to get to and I\u2019m sure Mr. Stark is really incredibly busy\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI do have a toddler now. And an ungrateful teenager, apparently.\u201d\u00a0\nPeter very distinctly ignores that. \u201c\u2014I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll have enough time to make it to my next class if I don\u2019t leave now. So can I please leave?\u201d\u00a0\nMr. Cobbwell gives him a look but Peter doesn\u2019t back down. Eventually, he says, \u201cAlright. Everyone say thank you to Mr. Stark for so generously spending his morning being here with us\u2014\u201d\nA couple students unmute just to say \u201cThank you, Mr. Stark,\u201d while even more post\u00a0thank yous\u00a0in the chat. Mr. Stark gives them an award winning Iron Man smile and, yeah, he definitely just gave them finger guns as well. Cindy\u2019s not quite sure if that makes him cooler or not, honestly.\u00a0\n\u201c\u2014And with that, class dismissed,\u201d Mr. Cobbwell finishes.\u00a0\nPeter is the first one to leave the meeting.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCindy Moon\u00a0has added\u00a0Peter Parker\u00a0to\u00a0Explanation Station\n[Peter Parker]: cindy its almost 3am\nPeter Parker\u00a0has left\u00a0Explanation Station\nCindy Moon\u00a0has added\u00a0Peter Parker\u00a0to\u00a0Explanation Station\n [Peter Parker]: It Is Almost Three In The Morning\u00a0\n[Cindy Moon]: throw us a bone, peter\n[Cindy Moon]: peter???\n[Cindy Moon]: peter you there???\n[Peter Parker]: listen.\u00a0\n[Peter Parker]: yes, okay, i know mr stark\n[Peter Parker]: and he promised to stay out of my calls originally so No One Else Would Know This but you all saw how well that went\n[Kenneth Lim]: guys its three am\n[Sue Lorman]: no shut up peters about to let something slip something i can feel it\n[Jason Ionello]: oh my god why is my phone going off at 3am\n[Zach Cooper]: everyone shut up let peter type!!!!\n[Peter Parker]: you guys are really invested in this huh\n[Zach Cooper]: dude u know The Tony Stark\n[Peter Parker]: i guess that\u2019s fair\n[Peter Parker]: mr stark heard that he was caught on video the other day and. well.\u00a0\n[Peter Parker]: he decided to make it worse\n[Sue Lorman]: you mean better\n[Peter Parker]: no i definitely mean worse\n[Peter Parker]: im pretty sure hes making you sign NDAs though\n[Cindy Moon]: hes making us do what\n[Sue Lorman]: what\n[Jason Ionello]: oh damn\n[Zach Cooper]: can someone tell me what an NDA is\n[Peter Parker]: i mean. he\u2019ll pay for your college\n[Cindy Moon]: nm my lips are sealed\u00a0\n[Jason Ionello]: same\n[Betty Brant]: yeah u know what. thats fair\n[Peter Parker]: ok! cool now that\u2019s all sorted out\u00a0\n[Peter Parker]: uhhhhhhhhhhh\nPeter Parker\u00a0has left\u00a0Explanation Station\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJust a day later, a mysterious envelope shows up at her door with a return address already stamped. Cindy wishes she could say she\u2019s surprised at the bolded 'Non-Disclosure Agreement' stamped at that top but, really, that would be a lie.\u00a0\nShe does end up reading through the entire thing, mostly because she has a big fat tendency to run her mouth and doesn\u2019t really want to get sued by a man who could buy a team of lawyers just to have them over for breakfast. Seeing the very eloquently written \u2018if you keep your mouth shut, we\u2019ll pay for your entire college and graduate program if you want\u2019 clause is very nice to read.\u00a0\nShe signs it without hesitation.\u00a0\nMr. Stark doesn\u2019t really make many more appearances after that, mostly because quarantine comes to an end and they\u2019re all back in normal school by the end of the month. When she sees Peter Parker in person for the first time, surrounded by both MJ and Ned, they only meet eyes for a second before Peter is hurriedly packing up his backs and heading to his next class.\u00a0\nThey don\u2019t say anything about what happened during those quarantine weeks. In fact, no one does.\u00a0\nCindy doesn\u2019t really ever get an answer as to why Peter Parker is at Tony Stark\u2019s house, of all places. She doesn\u2019t ever really get an answer to why Peter Parker knows Tony Stark in the first place. There are theories, of course, but there had been theories long before The Reveal happened and there will be theories long after. It\u2019s just yet another thing to add to the mystery that is Peter Parker.\u00a0\nHowever, with the prospect of a fully paid college tuition and the many hours of engineering and business tutoring from Mr. Tony Stark and Mrs. Pepper Potts themselves, she finds that she doesn\u2019t quite mind letting sleeping dogs lie. And, yeah, Cindy Moon is pretty sure she knows what weird looks like now.\u00a0\n\u00a0"
