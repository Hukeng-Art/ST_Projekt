    "text": "\u201cHave you ever noticed Malfoy?\u201d\nHermione\u2019s mind was preoccupied with an arithmancy formula, and it took her several seconds to process Ginny\u2019s question. She stared at the page in front of her a moment longer before looking up, bewildered, to meet Ginny\u2019s curious stare.\n\u201cNo. I don\u2019t generally make a habit of noticing Malfoy if I can help it.\u201d She narrowed her eyes as she studied Ginny. \u201cIs there something noticeable about him?\u201d\nGinny was sucking on the end of a sugar quill in a way that made Hermione\u2019s inner dentist wince. \u201cHe\u2019s really tall.\u201d\nHermione stared blankly for a moment before her eyes narrowed further. It was never a good sign when Ginny brought up topics indirectly. The last time it happened, it resulted in the Naked Pygmy Puff Roll, which Hermione shuddered to recall. \u00a0\nShe still woke up in the middle of the night sweating at the memory of Flitwick's expression.\n\u201cTall? That\u2019s what you think I should notice about Malfoy? His height?\u201d\nGinny quirked an eyebrow and licked the tip of her quill suggestively. \u201dWell, isn\u2019t that your thing? Lockhart. Krum. McLaggen. Ron. The only thing they have in common is being tall enough to give me a neck ache.\u201d\nHermione felt her ears grow hot, and she gripped her book tighter. \u201cI don\u2019t have a thing for tall men. Their height is\u2014completely coincidental.\u201d\n\u201cRight...\u201d Ginny said. Her face would be a picture of blank innocence if one eyebrow and the corner of her mouth didn't keep twitching up. \u201cSo you pined after my brother but never looked at Harry twice for a reason that isn\u2019t height related.\u201d\n\u201cHeight had absolutely nothing to do with it. Harry is like a brother to me,\u201d Hermione said, glaring over her book at Ginny.  Honestly.  \u201cIt\u2018s disturbing to think of him that way.\u201d\n\u201cAnd it wasn\u2019t with Ron because\u2014?\u201d\nHermione rolled her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not having this conversation. I don\u2019t have a thing for tall men, but if I did, why on earth would Malfoy be the first person you throw my way? There are dozens\u2014actually hundreds of wizards I\u2019d sooner date than him.\u201d\nGinny shrugged a shoulder and nibbled demurely at her quill. \u201cHe\u2019s not that bad.\u201d\nHermione snorted with disbelief. \u201cAre we talking about the same Draco Malfoy?\u201d\nGinny just looked at her quill. \u201cLast year\u2014He could have been a lot worse if he\u2019d wanted to.\u201d\nHermione scoffed and turned back at her books. \u201cSo what, you want me to notice Draco Malfoy\u2019s height in appreciation for him not being as much of a bastard as he possibly could have been?\u201d Absolutely not. She refused to entertain the notion. Ginny wasn't going to get her that easily. \u201dThat\u2019s a stellar recommendation.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDamnit.\u00a0\nMalfoy was tall.\u00a0\nShe wondered if he\u2019d grown again. He was nearly tall enough to rival Ron.\nIt shouldn\u2019t have mattered at all. Yet it somehow did.\u00a0\nHermione kept finding herself sneaking glances at him during classes, trying to estimate exactly how tall he was. He seemed to be in all her classes.\u00a0\nBugger. That was even worse. She really didn\u2019t want to regard him as being smart.\u00a0\nThis was all Ginny\u2019s fault. Hermione would never have noticed him at all if Ginny hadn\u2019t brought him up first. Now that the subject of Malfoy existed in Hermione\u2019s mind, she couldn\u2019t excise it. Much in the way she found herself incapable of excising the question of whether there were any other commonalities in her crushes beyond height.\u00a0\nSurely there was a deeper and more mature commonality.\u00a0\nShe was haunted by memories of herself telling Harry how much more fanciable he was since growing taller. Oh god, maybe she did have some sort of height obsession.\nIt didn\u2019t help that in the process of noticing Malfoy\u2019s height, she discovered that he wasn\u2019t the way she remembered him. Instead of the pretentious arse she was used to, he was withdrawn.\u00a0\nHe was a good student.\u00a0\nAnd he really was very tall. Which, she kept reminding herself, was of no particular importance.\u00a0\nNone of it mattered. She could be having amortentia wet dreams about him and it wouldn\u2019t make a bit of difference. Draco Malfoy was a bigoted arse. Even if he was the smartest, tallest, most unpretentious person in the entire school population, he would still be the first person who ever called her a Mudblood.\nGinny could date him herself if she was so keen about how much less a bastard he was than he could be.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cGranger.\u201d\u00a0\nShe was never going to forgive Slughorn. Not as long as she lived.\u00a0\nShe stared at the cauldron in front of her and refused to let herself even look up and acknowledge Malfoy or his ridiculous height as he came to join her table.\u00a0\nGracious. She barely reached the top of his shoulders, and her shoes had two-inch heels. She forcibly averted her eyes once more as her skin prickled.\n\u201cLet\u2019s just get this over with then, shall we?\u201d she said.\u00a0\nThere was a silence.\u00a0\n\u201cRight,\u201d was his clipped response. She refused to look at his face, but he sounded\u2014almost hurt.\nIt would be fine. It only took six months to brew Felix Felicis.\u00a0\nShe was never going to forgive Slughorn.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDid he have to always loom everywhere?\nRon was taller, according to Hermione\u2019s surreptitious estimates, but he had always been polite enough to slouch and duck his head down bashfully. It made him feel much shorter. Malfoy always seemed to stand around with a straight spine and squared shoulders, as though the student population might forget how much space he occupied if he didn\u2019t claim every centimetre of it at all times.\u00a0\nA shiver ran down her spine.\n\u201cGranger.\u201d\n Goddammit. Hermione started as she was reaching for a jar of ashwinder eggs and sighed with aggravation. \u201cMalfoy.\u201d\nShe wasn\u2019t sure if he was standing uncomfortably close, or if it just felt that way. The hair on her arms stood up as she turned to look up at him. His expression was closed, and his grey eyes flat and mirror-like.\u00a0\n\u201cHow long is this dance going to go on for?\u201d\nShe schooled her features into a severe expression and jutted her chin out. \u201cWe\u2019re not dancing,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cThere is no dancing for you with me in any future, immediate or distant.\u201d\nThe corner of his mouth pulled in a way that could have been a suppressed smirk or a sneer.\u00a0\n\u201cRight.\u201d He arched an eyebrow, staring down his narrow nose at her. \u201dYou just scuttle off whenever I come near and jump a foot in the air at the sound of my voice.\u201d His expression was tense. \u201cI don\u2019t care what you think of me, but I\u2019d appreciate it if you didn\u2019t sabotage our grade in Potions.\u201d\nHeat flooded across Hermione\u2019s face and up to her ears. \u201cAs if I would.\u201d She glared at him. \u201cDon\u2019t flatter yourself, Malfoy, I\u2019m hardly going to damage my academic record just to spite you.\u201d\nA low flush appeared in the hollows of his cheeks, and his jaw twitched.\u00a0\nShe shoved past him and stormed back to their cauldron.\nHe was lying. She wasn\u2019t overreacting to him or jumping. Their potion assignment was fine.\u00a0\nAfter class she found Ginny and slammed down several textbooks onto the desk beside her. \u201cWhat exactly is supposed to be so great about Malfoy?\u201d\nGinny looked up, raising a thin eyebrow, expression unsurprised. \u201cNoticed now, have you?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Hermione said, her voice snappish. \u201cI just don't know why you even brought him up. Your family has hated his for centuries. It\u2019s practically an established tradition at this point.\u201d\nGinny shrugged and looked away. \u201dYou weren\u2019t here last year.\u201d\u00a0\nHermione\u2019s back stiffened.\nGinny\u2019s voice was subdued, and she looked down at her hands. \u201cYou weren\u2019t. Ron wasn\u2019t. Harry wasn\u2019t. It\u2019s hard to explain what last year was like to anyone who wasn\u2019t part of it\u2014how it felt being here. I came here on my own. Snape was doing whatever he was doing. The Carrows were the ones in charge. The school was practically handed to Malfoy on a silver platter. He could have done anything to the other students if he wanted to.\u201d\nHermione stared at Ginny, and felt sick. \u201cDid he help DA last year?\u201d\nGinny rolled her eyes. \u201cNo\u2014well\u2026 no. Not really. He wasn\u2019t helping the resistance or anything. But\u2014he knew who was in DA, who the Carrows should have focused on, and he never ratted on us. He never did anything to make it worse than it was. When Neville, Luna, and I got caught trying to get the Sword of Gryffindor, Malfoy\u2019s the one who said we should be given detention with Hagrid. What the Carrows wanted to do was\u2014it was a lot worse. I guess I feel like I owe him a bit.\u201d\nHermione swallowed but then narrowed her eyes and folded her arms across her chest. \u201cI don\u2019t see you making any overtures of friendship.\u201d\nGinny shook her head. \u201cMalfoy doesn\u2019t want to be friends with me. Trust me, that\u2019s not why he did any of it. Never mind,\u201d she waved Hermione off. \u201cForget I ever said anything. The thing about him being your type was just a joke anyway.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHermione wished that she could forget.\u00a0\nShe also wished, for the first time in her academic career, that she had a stupider partner. Anyone else would have sat back and let Hermione just make the potion herself, but Malfoy loomed constantly.\u00a0\nHe had the audacity of checking and criticising how she\u2019d minced her squills, and saying her counter-clockwise stir rotations weren\u2019t perfectly circular. Hermione seethed with indignation and couldn\u2019t even argue or explain that the reason for her imperfect mincing and stirring was due to unreasonably-sized humans who were constantly hovering, leaning so close his robes brushed against hers, and affecting her concentration.\u00a0\n\u201dFor god\u2019s sake, Malfoy, has no one ever introduced you to the concept of personal space?\u201d She nearly screamed the question after having a small heart attack when a familiar hand suddenly reached over her head and plucked the book she was trying to reach off the shelf. She tugged at her shirt, fanning herself; when had it gotten so warm in the library?\nShe felt him stiffen behind her.\u00a0\nOh god, had she actually said that out loud? She wanted a hole to open up and swallow her as she awkwardly turned around to face him, her face hot enough to spontaneously combust.\u00a0\n\u201cSorry,\u201d she said without meeting his eyes. \u201cYou startled me.\u201d\nHe was silent, holding the book out without a word.\u00a0\n\u201cThanks,\u201d she grabbed it from him, and their fingers touched. Because he was unreasonably over-sized and had stupidly huge hands with ridiculously long slender fingers that she had never, ever stared at.\u00a0\nThe brief contact shot through her like an electric shock, and she nearly dropped the book.\u00a0\nHer face flushed hotter. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m just on edge sometimes. Jumpy, you know.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cRight.\u201d He turned on his heel.\u00a0\n\u201cWait, Malfoy.\u201d She gripped the book against her chest and forced a smile. Oh god, was she really doing this? Apparently she was. \u201cWould you like to\u2014study with me? I\u2019m working on the essay for History of Magic.\u201d\nHe paused and glanced back at her, expression flat. \u201cNo thanks. Granger.\u201d\nHe walked away.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMalfoy didn\u2019t want to be friends with her, he didn\u2019t want to be friends with Ginny, he didn\u2019t appear to want to be friends with anyone. No one in the school seemed to have anything to do with him. He sat alone at the far end of the Slytherin table, and none of the other students ever sat beside or across from him. His house-mates often went out of their way to hit him with their satchels as they shoved past, leaving the table.\u00a0\nHe\u2019d just sit there, stoic. His eyes were so visibly flat she could practically see the occlumency walls behind them. Even the first year Slytherins seemed to disdain him.\u00a0\nThe rest of the school acted as though he didn\u2019t even exist.\u00a0\nTraitor and Death Eater all at once.\u00a0\nHis old friends seemed to treat him as though he were a contagious disease.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid you mean it? Or did you just say it because you had to?\u201d\u00a0\nShe asked the question as she dropped into the seat beside him at Potions. It was ten minutes before class, and the room was empty besides them. She took a deep breath and then regretted it. He smelled silvery-green, and expensive.\nHow was that even a smell? She refrained from sniffing at him more closely to find out.\u00a0\nHe didn\u2019t look at her. He was sitting, staring across the room at the blackboard on the far wall. His expression was neatly contained.\u00a0\n\u201cMean what?\u201d he said after nearly a minute had passed.\u00a0\n\u201cYou said at trial that you were sorry. Did you mean it, or did you just say it because you had to?\u201d She squared her shoulders and twisted to face him. \u201cI won\u2019t tell anyone what you say, I just want to know.\u201d\nHe turned his head slowly to stare at her. His grey eyes were flat. \u201cWhy does it matter?\u201d\nHermione met his eyes. \u201cBecause I\u2019m the one you hated. So if you\u2019re sorry, I want to hear you say it to me.\u201d\nThe corner of his lip curled, and he leaned closer, his eyes glittering as he stopped, their faces barely inches apart. \u201cWhy? Are you going to take me under your wing like a destitute house-elf if I grovel for you?\u201d\nHermione didn\u2019t budge, but her breath came faster. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t pity you. I just wanted to know if you think you\u2019d have been different if you\u2019d had the chance.\u201d\nHe sat back abruptly, eyes going flat and shuttering again, just as Slughorn came bumbling into the classroom.\u00a0\nThey worked on their Felix Felicis that day without any issue. Hermione finally felt as though she\u2019d recovered a sense of equilibrium, and Malfoy kept his distance, even more withdrawn than usual.\u00a0 After they performed the necessary steps for the Felix Felicis, Slughorn had the class brewing potions to restock the hospital ward while he snored at his desk.\u00a0\nHermione headed for the library when the class was over.\u00a0\n\u201cGranger.\u201d\nShe stopped and waited for Malfoy. He stopped a few feet away from her. Her heartbeat sped up.\u00a0\nHis expression was hard. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have been different.\u201d\nOh. Well\u2026\nHermione gave a short, terse nod of acknowledgement. \u201cThanks for the honest answer.\u201d\nIt was as definitive and unpleasant to swallow as a bezoar.\u00a0\nShe shifted to walk away. Her throat felt tight, and there was a low burning sensation in the pit of her stomach.\u00a0\n\u201cBut,\u201d his voice had a brittle edge to it, \u201cI regret that.\u201d\u00a0\nShe paused, turning back.\u00a0\nHe\u2019d drawn himself up, knuckles white as he gripped the strap of his satchel. \u201cI am sorry. I meant it when I apologised, but I can\u2019t claim that they weren't the choices I made.\u201d\nHis expression twisted. \u201dNot the answer I imagine you hoped for.\u201d\nHe strode past her and up the steps before she could reply.\u00a0\nShe found him in the library. She hung her satchel on the chair next to him and seated herself.\u00a0\nHe looked up at her, surprise flashing across his face for an instant before occlumency walls flattened the expressiveness.\u00a0\nShe pulled her books out of her bag and started working on an essay. \u201dYou gave a good answer.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMalfoy was vastly superior to any other study partner Hermione had ever had. True, her sample group was primarily Harry and Ron, but she\u2019d been paired with various other classmates several times in the past, and none of them had been of any use whatsoever.\nMalfoy pulled his own weight easily, which astonished Hermione until she remembered that his primary companionship in school had been Crabbe and Goyle. They certainly hadn\u2019t been writing Malfoy\u2019s essays for him.\u00a0\nIt was surprisingly pleasant to work with someone who actually contributed rather than waiting for Hermione to hand-feed them all the answers.\u00a0\nOther students stared at them oddly, and Ginny liked doing suggestive things with her eyebrows whenever she caught sight of Hermione, but most everyone left them alone. Hermione had never had many friends at school, her pre-established prickly reputation kept everyone away from both herself and Malfoy.\u00a0\nThey studied together. That was all.\u00a0\nWhich was fine.\u00a0\nIt wasn\u2019t as if Hermione had expected anything as the months of their potion partnership rolled by. She certainly wasn\u2019t entertaining fantasies of dating him. That would be\u2014ridiculous.\u00a0\nHowever, along the way they became partnered in almost all their other classes as well. No one else wanted to work with him; they were already studying together, naturally Hermione volunteered, and he never seemed to mind.\u00a0\nBut work was all.\u00a0\nIt was fine.\u00a0\nIf Hermione had a type, which she didn\u2019t, and Malfoy happened to be it, which he wasn\u2019t, that wouldn\u2019t make her his type.\u00a0\nHermione was hardly the sort to be anyone\u2019s type. She\u2019d been resigned to that for a few years now.\u00a0\nIt was nice just having a study partner who studied. She wasn\u2019t going to let herself start thinking there needed to be anything more to it. She wasn\u2019t going to start daydreaming about things, even if Malfoy did tend to loom and regularly forget about the concept of personal space, standing so close that his body pressed against her back and made her breath catch; leaning over to read something in her notes with his face nearly touching hers.\nShe doubted that he meant anything by it because he refused to let their partnership ever extend beyond schoolwork.\nThey discussed school assignments often and at length, but the instant the conversation ranged anywhere beyond school, he closed up like a clam, his expression shuttered and non-reactive.\u00a0\nOther days, especially on Tuesdays after Potions when Hermione\u2019s hair was frizzing everywhere, still flushed and overly warm from spending hours brewing, or the days with duelling practice in DADA, he\u2019d be visibly discomfited and refuse to even look at her. They\u2019d take a study break and he\u2019d immediately stand up and walk stiffly away, not coming back until after Hermione had given up waiting and resumed studying on her own.\u00a0\nHermione thought that he\u2019d gradually come out of his shell and become vaguely conversational. A little while, and maybe she\u2019d see who Draco Malfoy was becoming post-war.\u00a0\nIt wasn\u2019t as though she was in any way unaware of how talkative he was historically inclined to be.\nBut even after weeks, he remained behind his occlumency walls. In fact, he seemed to progressively withdraw, and become increasingly tense around her. He had yards of notes, but anytime she asked him a question that left his exhaustively outlined research, there was always a long pause, as though he were debating whether to even respond.\u00a0\nHe wasn\u2019t verbally rude, which was novel, but after several months he was barely more communicative than a brick wall.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat did MacMillan want?\u201d Malfoy abruptly asked, when Hermione returned to their desk in the library.\u00a0\nHermione glanced over in surprise and found him glaring at her. Glaring wasn\u2019t unusual. Lately he seemed to spend most of his time either looming around her or glaring at other students or doing both things at the same time.\nShe shrugged.\u00a0\n\u201cHe wanted to know if I already have plans, or if I\u2019m available for Valentine's Day,\u201d she said, glancing at her Transfiguration essay, trying to remember what point she\u2019d been making in the last paragraph when Ernie interrupted her.\u00a0\nThere was a snap, and Hermione looked up to find that Malfoy had broken his obscenely expensive eagle quill in half. He didn\u2019t appear to have even noticed.\u00a0\n\u201cAvailable.\u201d He spat the word out, his mouth twisting as though it had a vile taste. \u201cHe asked if you\u2019re available for Valentine's Day?\u201d\nHis expression was so affronted he looked nearly feral. Hermione didn\u2019t think she\u2019d seen so much emotion on his face since he\u2019d returned to school.\nShe nodded, eyeing him. A shiver raced up her spine.\u00a0\nMalfoy stood up and walked away without a word. He came back half an hour later, gathered up his books and left again.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe glowered at her the next day when she sat down next to him.\u00a0\n\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d\nHe looked away. \u201cNo.\u201d\nHermione sighed and stared contemplatively at her arithmancy assignment.\nShe\u2019d taken every step that had brought them to the point of sitting beside each other in the library every day. All he\u2019d done so far was let her.\u00a0\nPerhaps being jealous of her nonexistent relationship with Ernie MacMillan would be enough to make him finally do something. She wasn't  manipulating him. She was just giving him a little push.\nMalfoy simply glowered. He managed to sulk nonstop through the next two weeks, looming even closer than before and shooting wounded, woebegone looks at her when he thought she wasn\u2019t paying attention. Hermione took deep, calming breaths whenever possible, reminding herself that she needed to respect other people's boundaries and not order them to ask her out.\nShe had volunteered herself as his partner in all their classes and invited herself to study with him daily. There was a point at which he had to take some initiative on his own.\u00a0\nMalfoy withdrew even further, which she hadn't thought was possible.\nOn Valentine\u2019s Day, he was both sulking and loitering suspiciously in the entrance hall as she set out for Hogsmeade Village.\u00a0\nHe blinked when he saw her and then looked her up and down several times with an expression of disbelief. \u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re wearing?\u201d\nHermione looked at herself. She had put on practical shoes, several layers, and a coat that was probably best described as sensible.\u00a0\n\u201cYes.\u201d She raised her eyebrows, \u201cI\u2019m on prefect patrol, since I didn\u2019t have a date for Valentine\u2019s Day.\u201d\nMalfoy stared at her for several seconds. \u201cMacMillan asked if you were available for prefect patrol?\u201d\nHermione gave a short nod. \u201cHe is Head Boy, and I\u2019m not in a relationship with anyone. So.\u201d\nMalfoy looked as though he\u2019d swallowed something the wrong way, the hollows of his cheeks flushed pink, but he didn\u2019t move or speak. Hermione straightened her scarf and pulled her knit hat down over her ears and walked past him without another word.\u00a0\nShe patrolled Hogsmeade, watching the giggling couples and trying not to roll her eyes. Being infatuated was all very well, but did they have to grin like maniacs the entire time? Valentine\u2019s Day was such a stupid holiday anyway.\u00a0\nUgh. She sounded like a resentful spinster. Would Crookshanks put up with it if she got more cats? She doubted it.\u00a0\nThen she spotted Malfoy, skulking alone near Three Broomsticks. That improved her mood considerably as she pretended to not see him. She stopped after passing him for the third time.\u00a0\n\u201cSomething you want to say?\u201d she asked in a crisp voice.\u00a0\nThere was a pause.\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d he finally said.\u00a0\nHer heart sank, but she nodded. \u201cI figured.\u201d\nShe turned away. \u201cMake sure you\u2019re back at the castle before curfew.\u201d\n\u201cGranger...\u201d\u00a0\nShe paused, heart almost racing as she looked back.\u00a0\nMalfoy already looked as though he regretted speaking up. There was a sort of hollowness in the middle of her chest as she stood, staring expectantly at him while he stood there, silent.\u00a0\nWell, she was done talking for both of them. If he felt entitled to sulk and follow her around, he\u2019d also be required to talk on occasion.\u00a0\nHe\u2019d always had plenty to say back when he wanted her dead.\u00a0\nHer stomach twisted.\u00a0\nThe silence stretched on and on, and Malfoy just kept standing there with his occlumency shuttered expression, apparently having decided to resume being monosyllabic and just pretend he hadn\u2019t said anything.\u00a0\nAfter an unbearably long wait, Hermione put her hand on her hip.\u00a0\n\u201cLet\u2019s not do this anymore, Malfoy.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI get it. I\u2019m sure to you it\u2019s monumental to even stand here and contemplate a Muggle-born.\u201d Her voice was bitter. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m supposed to be flattered that you\u2019re even here, but I\u2019m not. I\u2019m not going to beg for you to want me. I don\u2019t have any interest in being this difficult to choose.\u201d\nShe looked away and scoffed. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it makes me a romantic or not, but I don\u2019t want a relationship where I have to go through life wondering whether the cost-benefit analysis still manages to fall in my favour every time I\u2019m vaguely inconvenient.\u201d\u00a0\nShe inhaled until the cold air burned in her lungs. \u201cSo\u2014I\u2019m done now. I\u2014\u201c she forced a smile, \u201c\u2014I won\u2019t be bothering you anymore.\u201d\nMalfoy remained silent and unreactive.\nThere was a quick stab of disappointment in her chest as she waited a moment longer before turning away. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. You don\u2019t need to say anything. You never do.\u201d\nShe pivoted on her toe and continued on the patrol route.\u00a0\nShe heard Malfoy curse as she walked away.\n\u201cWait. Granger.\u201d He\u2019d abruptly reappeared out of an alley, and she barely managed to keep from instinctively stunning him as he caught her by the shoulders.\u00a0\nHe gripped her for a moment before wrenching his hands away and backtracking.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s not because you\u2019re Muggle-born, that\u2019s not why\u2014\u201c he paused. \u201cI\u2019m not\u2014\u201c he swallowed visibly. \u201cI\u2019m not a good person.\u201d\u00a0\nHermione stared at him. \u201cI know.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2014\u201c he hesitated and looked at a loss for words, \u201cBeing nice isn\u2019t something I do.\u201d\nHermione nodded carefully. His eyes didn\u2019t currently have any of that walled flatness to them. They were almost glowing with intensity. His expression was open. He stepped towards her. Something in the back of Hermione\u2019s mind skittered, wanting to back away, but she refused to budge as he closed in, edging closer until there was hardly any space left between their bodies.\u00a0\nHis head dipped down towards her face, his eyes searching.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not hesitating because you\u2019re hard to choose.\u201d His voice was almost a whisper.\nHe felt impossibly close even though they weren\u2019t touching.\u00a0She had never been so vividly aware of the sensation of not touching someone. It was as though every nerve in her body was on fire, just waiting.\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2014that\u2019s not why.\u201d\nHermione lifted her chin. \u201cWhy then?\u201d\nHe inhaled, jaw tensing. \u201cThis is my second chance, right?\u201d He tilted his head to the side as he stared down at her unguardedly. \u201cLast chance, I suppose I should say. Not for redemption, of course, that opportunity already slipped me by. But my one last chance to be sorry.\u201d\nHermione stared up at him, trying to take him in. He was being himself. Not the version Hermione was acquainted with from past years, but the new iteration that he\u2019d been gradually evolving into within the walled cocoon of occlumency he constantly hid behind.\nHe felt\u2014bigger. More vivid. The intensity of him bursting out in a way that she\u2019d only seen glimmers of during the last several months.\u00a0\nHis expression was strained. \u201cYou\u2014are very easy to want to choose. Too easy, if I\u2019m honest, which I\u2019m not generally when I can help it.\u201d His lips twitched into a vague grimace. \u201cI\u2019m greedy, I\u2019ve never been nice in my entire life, and I have never done well with not getting the things I want. So, imagine how it feels to want someone that I know I have no chance with.\u201d\nHis mouth pulled into a bitter smile like a knife blade. \u201cI\u2019ll always be judged by the mistakes of my past now. One misstep is all I have left, and I know I\u2019ll make it because I\u2019ve fucked up practically every single thing I\u2019ve done in my entire life.\u201d His voice was becoming raw and his expression twisted. \u201cBut just think how much worse it will be, when that happens, if there\u2019s someone that I let myself think I could have.\u201d\nHe was impossibly close now. She could feel his robes brushing against her legs and the faintest shiver of his breath across her skin. His hand rose up and hovered near her cheek, so close she could feel the heat of it. It was as though he were an instant from cradling her face in his hand, but his hand stayed suspended.\u00a0\n\u201cSomeone important to me, who I tried to be better for. When I fuck everything up again, she\u2019ll be the first person hurt by it.\u201d\u00a0\nHis hand dropped, not away but lower. Hermione\u2019s heart stalled, and she gave a small gasp as his fingertips pulled down her scarf just enough for his fingers to brush against her throat as his thumb ran across the narrow scar there.\n\u201cI think,\u201d he said staring at it, \u201cI\u2019ve already hurt her enough.\u201d\nHe withdrew his hand and stepped back, clearing his throat. His expression slowly shuttered again, all the light and intensity in his eyes guttered out as he shrank back and reverted to that puppet version of himself. \u201cIt\u2019s not because you\u2019re hard to choose, it\u2019s because you\u2019re almost impossible not to choose. I've never done well saying no to myself, but I am trying to. I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean for you to think it was because you\u2019re Muggle-born.\u201d\nHermione\u2019s heart was pounding in her chest. \u201cOh,\u201d she finally managed to say. \u201cSorry. I just assumed.\u201d\n\u201cIt was a fair assumption,\u201d he said, voice flat, looking away from her.\u00a0\nShe drew a deep breath. \u201cWell, you know, you shouldn\u2019t decide things for other people. You can\u2019t go around choosing which risks they\u2019re allowed to take. Especially not me.\u201d She put her hands on her hips and gave him her most piercing glare. \u201cI really don\u2019t like it when people tell me I can\u2019t do something just because it\u2019s difficult or I might get hurt\u2014so you should just give up any ideas that you get to go around around deciding things for me.\u201d\nShe snorted, rolling her eyes. \u201cHonestly, of the two of us, my decision-making record is vastly superior to yours.\u201d\nMalfoy made a choking sound.\u00a0\nHermione stepped closer and held out her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t decide things for me without asking. Alright?\u201d\nHe hesitated for several seconds before taking her hand and giving a tentative nod.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAfter Valentine\u2019s Day, they weren\u2019t dating exactly, but they had what Hermione privately termed an exclusive hand-holding arrangement.\u00a0\nTheir fingers would wander over and find each other under the desks in class and while studying in the library.\u00a0\nMalfoy had astonishingly expressive hands. And long fingers. Terribly long fingers. His fingertips would dance along the back of her hands, tracing her knuckles or stroking patterns on her palm and inner wrist that sent tingles through her entire body. His little finger would absent-mindedly hook around hers when he was reading, or he\u2019d start massaging the base of her thumb when a rune translation had her ready to start pulling her hair out.\u00a0\nIt was astonishingly erogenous.\u00a0\nHermione felt like some repressed Puritan. Just looking at his hands became enough to make her blush. Heat would start pooling in her lower abdomen and her nipples would harden when his thumb brushed across her knuckles, and she\u2019d squirm when their fingers laced secretly together under the desk at Potions.\u00a0\nHermione had snogged boys and had less of a physical reaction than she had when the back of Draco Malfoy\u2019s hand touched hers. They didn\u2019t even hold hands properly most of the time, normally it was knuckles against each other, and a few fingers enlaced.\u00a0\nSomehow it was the most arousing thing that had ever happened to her.\u00a0\nHermione would find herself flushing warmer and warmer while Malfoy remained stoically silent and externally unruffled while caressing her fingers in a way that felt like it should be a violation of half the school ordinances and possibly illegal.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMalfoy was trying to kill her with frustration.\n\u201cI think we should kiss,\u201d she said abruptly after weeks of having her hand fondled to a degree that had her seriously contemplating jumping Malfoy right there in the library.\nMalfoy went so still he could have been petrified. Hermione turned and found him staring.\n\u201cKiss?\u201d he said after an interminable feeling silence.\u00a0\nShe nodded matter-of-factly. \u201cYes. If you\u2019re comfortable with that.\u201d\nHe slowly moved his head in a vague pattern of assent.\u00a0\n\u201cAlright then. Now? Or later?\u201d The corner of her mouth turned up in a suppressed smile of anticipation.\u00a0\nThere was another long pause. \u201cNow.\u201d\nThank god. She turned towards him but found facing him profoundly awkward. His expression was visibly apprehensive and not at all the way one would hope a boy would look under such circumstances. Hermione wilted.\u00a0\nThis was just ridiculous. Any other boy and they\u2019d probably be having conversations and sex by now. Not Malfoy. Aside from the handholding aspect, he continued to be aggravatingly restrained and about as proactive as a sea sponge.\u00a0\n\u201cI also think I should call you Draco,\u201d she said nodding to herself, \u201cand you should call me Hermione\u2014if you ever happen to address me of your own volition.\u201d\nDraco choked and now looked ready to bolt.\u00a0\nThis was absurd. She was positive that being a teenager was not supposed to be this awkward. Were there steps she was overlooking?\u00a0\n\u201cNever mind,\u201d she said, turning back to her books. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean that we should if you don\u2019t want to. I thought maybe you did.\u201d\n\u201cWait\u2014\u201d Draco\u2019s voice was plaintive.\u00a0\nShe turned to look at him again, eyes narrowing. \u201cDo you want to kiss me? Because if you do, it\u2019s not even remotely obvious.\u201d\nHe stared at her affronted for an instant. Then his eyes gleamed, and he jerked her hand, pulling her sideways and his closed lips met hers.\u00a0\nIn less than two seconds he sat back and scrutinized her, looking worried.\u00a0\nHermione grimaced and scowled at him. \u201cNot like that, idiot. I\u2019m not your mum. Kiss me properly.\u201d\nShe really did have to do everything herself.\u00a0\nShe seized hold of his robes and jerked him forwards.\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t kiss my mother,\u201d Draco managed to say sulkily just as their lips met for the second time.\u00a0\nHermione kissed him properly, and bit him just a little as punishment for always having to do all the work. His lips were soft, a bit thin, but nice. There was definitely potential.\u00a0\nShe started to sit back, but as she drew away, his chair twisted, legs screeching on the wood floor as his hand caught her shoulder and he pulled her back, capturing her lips; half-dragging her out of her chair and into his arms. Her heart somersaulted.\u00a0\nHermione stumbled forward, and his arm wrapped firmly around her waist while his other hand found her jaw, and she toppled into his lap as he kissed her hungrily. She could feel her skin flush warmer as she pressed against him.\nAs with hand holding, Malfoy was excellent at kissing once he actually started doing it. His fingertips ran across the arch of her cheekbones, tracing the curve of her jaw before finding a sensitive place behind her ear that made her shiver while his lips caressed hers. A frisson of pleasure vibrated through her like a string on an instrument. She squirmed in his lap, heart racing in her chest. His tongue flicked against her lips in the same languorous, teasing manner that his fingers often brushed against her hand, which meant that he\u2019d been purposefully making her horny during classes for the last several weeks.\u00a0\nPrat. She kissed him back with a vengeance.\u00a0\nShe had spent an obscene amount of time wondering what kissing Malfoy would be like. Whether she\u2019d like it or find it just alright.\u00a0\nHistorically, she didn\u2019t particularly care for kissing. It tended to be rather anticlimactic or wet. Viktor had been nervous and so chaste it was underwhelming. Cormac had been like being attacked by a whomping willow, his hands and fingers rough and entitled. He\u2019d shoved his tongue into her mouth before she\u2019d even realized they were kissing. Ron was\u2014well, his kisses were rather wet, and his hands never seemed to go where that she wanted them. He had his favourite spots to squeeze, and even when she\u2019d move his hands to preferred locations, they always immediately wandered back.\u00a0\nMalfoy was an entirely new experience in kissing. Every time his fingers so much as shifted against her skin, she felt herself grow warmer and tingles ran through her entire body until her toes were curling in her shoes.\u00a0\nHe nipped at her lower lip with his teeth a moment before his tongue slid against hers. The quick spark of pain melded with the rushing headiness until she could hardly think straight. Hermione moaned and tangled her fingers through his hair, finally mussing up that enraging contained and perfect appearance of his as she shifted, straddling him so that their bodies were pressed together. She wanted to feel all of him, all that intensity he kept holding back from her. She wanted to break through his walls and find those things he kept so restrained. It would just be hers. The thought flared through her like fireworks, and she pulled him closer as he greedily kissed her as though he were breathing her in, snatching the oxygen from between her teeth.\nThe whole world was burning, through her lungs, into her veins and out her fingertips as she sat tangled in his arms. He groaned and his fingers ran up into her hair, twisting in her curls and pulling her lips more firmly against his.\u00a0\nHis hand on her waist had found the edge of her shirt, and his fingers slid under the fabric. Hermione gasped as his hand spanned the small of her back against her bare skin and then slithered up, tracing her ribs. Her whole body tensed and wanting more. Oh god, this was so very good.\nShe shifted closer, arching her back in order to get a better angle, almost kneeling over him in his chair. Both of his hands were under her shirt, nearly spanning her waist and sliding upwards. His head tilted back to meet her lips as she ran her fingers through his hair again, ruffling it, and he moaned against her lips.\u00a0\nThe sound sent a rushing sense of possessive heat straight through her.\u00a0 Her fingers trailed down his neck, using the collar on his robes to pull him closer, loosening his tie, and finding the buttons on his robes.\nHis body against hers was delightfully hard, and\u2014\n\u201cMiss Granger! Mr Malfoy! Twenty points from Gryffindor and Slytherin for indecent behaviour!\u201d\nHermione screamed and nearly jumped out of her skin at the abrupt invasion of Madam Prince\u2019s sharp voice.\u00a0\nShe wrenched herself away from Draco and nearly fell on her face as she scrambled off his chair and struggled to regain her balance as she faced the enraged librarian.\u00a0\n\u201cSorry,\u201d she said, gasping for breath, feeling as though her face was about the burst into flames. \u201cWe\u2014we didn\u2019t mean to. We got carried away.\u201d\n\u201cThis library is the seat of knowledge; it is no place for such carnal behaviours. If I see any further misconduct, it will be fifty points and detention.\u201d Pince sniffed and glared at them both. \u00a0\nHermione guiltily stuffed her shirt back into her skirt. Draco appeared to be impersonating an armadillo, his large frame was curved into a tight ball in his chair and only the tips of his bright red ears were currently visible.\u00a0\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he said in the thick voice without looking up.\u00a0\nMadam Pince glared a moment longer before turning away.\u00a0\nHermione sank shakily into her seat beside Malfoy. \u201cWell...\u201d she finally said, because she couldn\u2019t think of anything else to say.\nMalfoy still hadn\u2019t unfolded. He was breathing heavily, his head nearly resting on the edge of the desk for several minutes.\u00a0\n\u201cRight,\u201d he said when he finally straightened, his voice still thick and almost rasping.\u00a0\n\u201cSorry,\u201d she said, feeling so embarrassed she thought she might die and staring determinedly at her essay. \u201cI got carried away.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014fine.\u201d\nHermione refused to let herself look up, and Malfoy didn\u2019t say anything else. Her heart was still pounding. She kept sneaking glances sideways and finding Draco\u2019s eyes intently fastened on the textbook in front of him, his ears still tinged pink.\u00a0\nShe really should have waited to propose kissing when they were somewhere else. She was just shameless. One kiss and she\u2019d proceeded to practically climb him and start taking off his clothes.\u00a0\nHer face was so hot she could probably warm a cauldron with it.\u00a0\nAfter ten minutes, she was finally able to make herself calm down enough to focus on homework, still keenly aware of Malfoy sitting stiff and silent beside her. Oh god, what if he was angry and embarrassed about it?\u00a0\nHe probably wouldn\u2019t even say so. He\u2019d just withdraw again, or maybe start avoiding her.\u00a0\nShe should have just resigned herself to an indefinite period of erotic handholding. That was apparently all she had the capacity to handle.\u00a0\nA few minutes later there was a light touch against the back of her hand where it was resting on the desk.\nShe looked up.\u00a0\nMalfoy was still reading, but his hand had wandered over and found hers, his index finger running along her knuckles. She turned her hand, arching her fingers to catch and entwine with his.\u00a0\nThey didn\u2019t say anything else, but he didn\u2019t let go until it was time to go to dinner.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey were careful not to kiss in the library again. At least not intensively or for very long. However, occasionally such things were unavoidable.\u00a0\nAs a result, their study sessions mysteriously migrated out of the library into other less populated parts of the castle.\u00a0\nEmpty classrooms, alcoves tucked away behind tapestries. The greenhouses.\u00a0\nDraco still wasn\u2019t talkative, but he was adept at non-verbal communication. A bit too adept. Apparently he was also capable of time travelling because Hermione was certain they couldn\u2019t possibly be spending their entire afternoons each day snogging, yet she found herself staying up to ungodly hours of the night in order to finish reading that she hadn\u2019t managed to get done during study times.\u00a0\nThey weren\u2019t having sex, but only by the vast benevolence of technicality.\u00a0\nHowever, during all the sex they weren\u2019t having, there was an abundant quantity of undressing and fondling and licking. And orgasms.\nMany, many orgasms.\u00a0\nIn the process, Hermione had come to terms with the fact that she was indeed shameless, and decided to embrace this newfound aspect of her personality.\u00a0\nAt the moment, her time table indicated that she was supposed to be drilling arithmancy equations, but instead she was sitting on top of Draco on an abandoned professor\u2019s desk, kissing him slowly while unbuttoning his shirt.\u00a0\nHer fingers traced down his chest, finding the scars that zig-zagged across his torso. She followed one of the slashing lines with her fingertips as she nuzzled his face with her nose, nipping at the arch of his cheekbone. His hands were sliding up her back, peeling her jumper off and over her head.\u00a0\n\u201cThis is a very sturdy desk,\u201d Hermione said under her breath as she shimmied her hips down his body, twisting her hand behind her back to unfasten her bra.\u00a0\n\u201cMhmm,\u201d Draco was nibbling along her neck while he pulled her bra off and his sinfully dexterous fingers began stroking the underside of her breasts in a way that made her head drop as she moaned.\u00a0\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t\u2014even creak, \u201d she said, nearly collapsing as he tweaked her nipple and his thigh pressed between her legs exactly where she wanted him.\u00a0\n\u201cMmm,\u201d was all the response she got from him as he shifted out from under her, pinned her down, and proceeded to kiss her until she could barely think straight.\u00a0\nWhen he finally broke away for air and began kissing his way down her body, she caught him by the hair and tugged him back up until he was looking at her again.\u00a0\nShe really was going to have to do this too.\u00a0\n\u201cDraco,\u201d she held him by the robes and rubbed her thigh against his obvious erection, \u201cwhat I\u2019m trying to say is that we should have sex. Here. On this desk.\u201d\nHe stared. Eyes wide and expression almost closed, but despite the mask his pupils bloomed out, black swallowing the grey. His expression gradually grew hungrier and hungrier.\nThere was still a wall there. She could see it in his eyes.\n\u201cNow?\u201d he finally said.\nHermione blinked owlishly at him. \u201cYes. Obviously now, did you think I stopped you because I wanted to schedule it for next week?\u201d\nBefore he could reply, she pulled him closer until their faces were practically touching and wriggled her hips in a way that made him bite his lip and groan.\u00a0\n\u201cDraco Malfoy, I want you to have sex with me on this desk. Right now. Is that alright with you?\u201d\n\u201cYes...\u201d he practically hissed the word through his gritted teeth.\u00a0\n\u201cGood. It\u2019s settled then.\u201d She kissed him again and shoved his shirt off, running her fingers admiringly over his shoulders. She might not like Quidditch, but it did have certain undeniable benefits.\nIt would have been nicer to have sex somewhere involving a bed, without vague thoughts of splinters or the cold. But the faculty at Hogwarts really went out of their way to ensure that was practically impossible. Hermione forgot to think about most of that within a matter of moments as Draco\u2019s mouth closed on her breast and his long fingers hooked around her knickers, dragging them down her legs. His skin was warm against hers, and it marked with every greedy nip she gave him while finding the buckle of his belt and the zip of his trousers, and then reaching in and curling her fingers around the rigid length of his cock as he groaned and bucked in her hand.\u00a0\nHis fingers curled possessively between her legs, caressing her where she was so sensitive and ready. She shivered as his fingers trailed lower, stroking and sliding slowly into her.\u00a0\nShe gasped and clenched as he bit his lip and pushed his fingers in deeper. She gripped his cock tighter as a familiar heat coiled low inside her pelvis. His thumb pressed carefully between her legs as she gave an incoherent mewl and bucked against his hand.\u00a0\n\u201cOh please,\u201d she said in a ragged voice, torn between parting her legs further and hooking them around his waist in the hopes he\u2019d finally fuck her.\u00a0\nHis thumb pressed her clit again, moving in slow circles as his fingers slid deeper, finding a specific spot behind her pelvis that made her eyes cross.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cNo. I want this with you... \u201d She slid her hand down his length, tugging and shifting her hips until he was aligned.\u00a0\nHe withdrew his fingers. His expression still closed, but his eyes were carefully locked on her face as he pushed in slowly. She exhaled unsteadily, and he instantly froze.\n\u201cIs\u2014?\u201d\nShe cut him off. \u201cThis is good.\u201d\nHer head tilted back as he slid in further with a low groan, his body curling forward, over and around her as he sank in to the hilt.\u00a0\nHermione gave a low sigh, just relishing the sensation of being this close to him. So connected. She rolled her hips up to meet his.\nSuddenly, and quite unexpectedly, he started talking. It took her a moment to register it.\u00a0\nHis head was buried against her shoulder, and she could make out less than half of the words, but she got the general idea because he said everything about a dozen times as he held her close, talking under his breath as he peppered her skin with kisses.\u00a0\nShe hadn\u2019t expected it\u2014it hadn\u2019t even occurred to her that he would talk during sex.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re perfect\u2014Don\u2019t even know\u2014\u201c his hands were roaming everywhere, sliding along the length of her body and up her arms to her wrists until she was stretched out under him, hands pinned above her head. His voice was breathless. \u201cYou\u2019re so perfect\u2014never thought\u2014didn\u2019t even want to dream.\u201d\u00a0\nHe kissed her hungrily and thrust deeper in a way that filled her so intensely that her toes curled. She wrapped her legs tightly around his hips.\u00a0\nHe rested his forehead against hers. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you\u2014never. I swear, I\u2019ll die before I hurt you.\u201d\u00a0\nShould she say something? She felt like she should, but she wasn\u2019t exactly sure what to say.\u00a0\n\u201dNever thought I'd have a chance, \u201d he said nuzzling her ear. \u201dTried not to want you\u2014no idea how hard you are to stay away from. I don\u2019t know\u2014why you would\u2014I\u2019m so happy.\u201d\nHe squeezed her hands where their fingers were entwined as he sank into her again, and she gave a low moan, body tensing under his.\n\u201cSaved me\u2014I thought I was going to be alone for the rest of my life,\u201d he said against her throat, his voice raw.\u00a0\nHermione slid her hands free from his and cradled his face, tilting his head up so she could look into his eyes.\u00a0\n\u201cDraco\u2014Draco,\u201d she said, curling her head forwards in order to press their faces together. \u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d\nHe stared at her. \u201cI just want you to know.\u201d\nShe smiled at him, running her thumb across his cheekbone. \u201cI know. I\u2019m here because I know.\u201d\nHe nodded. \u201cAlright.\u201d\nShe kissed him slowly until he groaned against her lips. His body curled around her as he held her close. The vibrating, raw, unrestrained intensity was finally hers, and she felt as though she could catch fire from it.\u00a0\nHis fingers tangled with hers, and when she shattered, she gripped his hands so tightly she barely knew where she ended and he began.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAfterwards, they stayed tangled together for several minutes. Hermione\u2019s eyes were closed as she lay catching her breath. Draco stroked back a few curls that were sticking to her face before kissing her cheek.\n\u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d\n\u201cMmm?\u201d She cracked an eye open.\u00a0\n\u201cWhy did you ask me, that day in Potions, if I was sorry?\u201d\nHer eyes snapped open. Draco was staring down at her. \u201cOh, well\u2014I noticed you.\u201d\n\u201cYou noticed me?\u201d He arched an eyebrow.\u00a0\nHermione could feel a low flush developing in the hollows of her cheeks. \u201cJust\u2014little things at first. Then Ginny told me that you protected DA last year, and that made me wonder\u2014\u201c\n\u201cWhat did you notice?\u201d He was staring down at her, looking quizzical.\u00a0\nHermione\u2019s mouth twitched and the tips of her ears grew hot. \u201cIt was just\u2014silly. The first thing I noticed. Really, it was finding out about DA that made me\u2014\u201c\nHe cocked his head to the side. \u201cWhat was it?\u201d\nOh god. He wasn\u2019t going to let it go.\u00a0\n\u201cNothing. It really wasn\u2019t\u2014\u201c\n\u201cYou can\u2019t tell me?\u201d There was a flicker of hurt in his eyes.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like that. It\u2019s just\u2014embarrassing.\u201d Her face was growing warmer and warmer. She hid her face in her hand. \u201cYou\u2019ll think I\u2019m so shallow if I tell you.\u201d\n\u201cGranger\u2014\u201c Draco sounded exasperated.\nHermione groaned, she pulled her hand away and stared up at him. \u201cFine,\u201d she said, her voice resigned. \u201cThe reason I first noticed you was because Ginny pointed out how tall you are.\u201d\nDraco blinked down at her, expression blank as though the answer simply didn\u2019t register. Hermione\u2019s face grew molten hot, and she slung her arm over her face to conceal her sense of embarressed horror.\n\u201cYou noticed me\u2026\u201d he said slowly, \u201cbecause of my height?\u201d\u00a0\nShe sat up, crossing her arms. Draco was staring at her, his expression a mixture of amusement and affront.\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2014was just the first thing. That\u2019s not why we\u2019re here now. It was just the\u2014impetus. Once I noticed your height, I kept noticing other things about you that made me more curious.\u201d She inhaled. \u201cI decided to ask that day because I wanted to know if you were someone worth knowing now. And it turned out that you were, which is the important part. That\u2019s the point that we really should be focused on.\u201d\u00a0\nShe ducked her head. \u201cHowever\u2014if I\u2019m entirely honest, it all started because I was trying to figure out how tall you are.\u201d\nDraco eyed her sceptically for a moment longer before his shoulders began shaking with suppressed laughter.\u00a0\n\nThe End\n\n\n\n"
