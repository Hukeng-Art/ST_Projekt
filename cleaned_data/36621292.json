    "text": "Nedzu watched with amusement through the security cameras he was given access to as the HPSC went through a power transfer. Not one they wished willingly to have, but with the amount of blackmail evidence being dangled behind that wide toothy smile and sharp green eyes, well, what could they do? Say no? That would risk a total upheaval of society itself and more than a little jail time. So he was given the privilege of watching the old president of the HPSC get forcefully escorted out of her office as the newly dubbed president, despite his young age, watched on. His face was unreadable past the polite smile that seemed carved into his skin. \n A wonderful way to spend his Saturday morning.\n He could still remember the first time he was approached by the now president. Having already finished all of his necessary schooling and just starting on his first college degree, the newly dubbed teen had shown up at his private gate along the UA wall and politely asked for a meeting. Considering not even the faculty knew of that entrance? It was safe to assume he was curious. \nWhat had followed was a fascinating discovery of another brilliant mind that could not only challenge him, but outdo him when it came to a select few topics. It was marvelous and he had immediately pushed forth for a weekly tea time between them. He wouldn\u2019t dare let an opportunity such as that one slide past him. \nHe chuckled at the memory of the flustered mess the teen had become, embarrassed and yet validated on a level that bordered on desperate. Considering the label of quirkless, it wasn\u2019t a surprise. He was glad that society hadn\u2019t had the time to instill a crippling amount of self-deprecation in him or he may have never been given the chance to know him. \nSociety was always so good at snuffing out that which scares it, silencing the minority while placing those it deems worthy on pedestals. \n(He had a lab setting for his worst nightmare, this teen didn't have such a luxury. How sad is it, then, that something so horrendous could be considered better?)\nThus, he watched. A wide smile that would send his faculty running stretched onto his face as someone who was at the bottom of the barrel just 3 years ago reached out and grabbed his fate with his own hands, yanking it out of society's clutches and making a path for himself.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\u201cAre you being serious? I have no time for games, Nedzu,\u201d he asked irritatedly.\n There was just no way that after all this time, the HPSC would suddenly change its mind. They\u2019ve been keeping UA underneath a microscope for so long, picking at them like vultures to a dead carcass, yet suddenly they want to be cooperative? He doesn\u2019t believe for a second.\n \u201cI am Shouta-kun. I understand your reservations about this all-\u201d\n \u201cJustifiable caution.\u201d\n \u201c-considering previous attitudes, however there is a very easy explanation as to why the HPSC is being so\u2026 lenient.\u201d The rat finished, an amused grin in place of his normal polite smile.\n \u201cAnd what, pray tell, is this explanation,\u201d he grouched, eyes narrowed in disbelief.\n He knew Nedzu wasn\u2019t joking, hell the rat hated the HPSC more than he did. Yet, he just couldn\u2019t believe that the group of stuck up fuckers that reigned like overlords behind the scenes of the world of heroics would be so accepting. Especially considering the attitude the president had, he had only met them once and that was enough for a lifetime.\n Nedzu flashed him a smile he reserved for moments of true victory, all predatory and pleased.\nHe was instantly thrown off guard.\n \u201cSimple, the previous president of the HPSC was removed from office yesterday morning and the replacement is actually a good friend of mine. Someone who knows quite a bit of the dark side of society and wishes to change it.\u201d\n The mug that was placed firmly in his hands slipped.\n \u201cWhat,\u201d he asked flatly, face blank in shock.\n \u201cI do quite enjoy our tea sessions, though I suppose he will be a bit too busy for the next few months as he adjusts. I guess I\u2019ll have to push back our tea time to a later date.\u201d The rat contemplated, completely ignoring him. A little deserved since he just shattered a mug on Nedzu\u2019s floor, but he also just had the metaphorical rug ripped out from underneath him so he feels a little justified.\n \u201cThe president of the HPSC was replaced on Saturday and no one was notified,\u201d he stated calmly, a stark difference to the internal chaos he was feeling.\n \u201cYes!\u201d The Rat chirped. \u201cHe\u2019ll be paying a visit during the exam\u2019s for the incoming 1st years, he\u2019s quite curious about the effectiveness of the new exam format!\u201d\n \u201cIs there a reason as to why this changing of power, one that effects the entire fucking country, was done in absolute secret without anyone knowing?\u201d He ignored the fact that Nedzu knew. \nHe always knows.\n \u201cAh, that\u2019s because the president was coerced into giving up her position!\u201d Hold on a minute- \u201cDon\u2019t worry, the hero community will be notified once the new year starts!\u201d He wasn\u2019t worried about when they would be notified anymore, what did Nedzu just say? \u201cThe current president wants to make some small changes beforehand.\u201d\n What the actual fuck was happening???\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\u201cShouta? Is there something wrong love?\u201d\n \u201cThe world is ending, Hizashi, the rat has friends and they're just as bad as the chimera himself.\u201d\n \u201cOh- oh no.\u201d\n.\n.\n.\n.\nHe gave his mirror a polite smile as he finished tying the knot on his tie, fortunately not looking like he was attempting to strangle himself for once. All that practice had paid off.\n He walked out and gave his mom a goodbye hug, one she happily reciprocated after worrying about him to make sure he looked presentable, before heading out of the apartments to reach his chauffeur. When he reached the inconspicuous car he had chosen- why use an expensive car if it\u2019ll stick out like a sore thumb?- he huffed an amused breath as red entered his vision, the host grinning a bright grin that had become increasingly more common since Saturday.\n \u201cI assume you're my \u2018bodyguard\u2019 then?\u201d He asked the winged hero.\n \u201cAbsolutely Boss-man!\u201d Keigo chirped. \u201cI was appointed-\u201d\n \u201cSelf-appointed,\u201d he cut in, amused.\n \u201c-as your one and only bodyguard for any and all things. Can\u2019t let you go out alone, green bean, that's dangerous.\u201d Keigo grinned a shit-eating grin as he held open the door from him, a single hand waving off his words.\n With an amused glance, he was going to UA which was objectively the safest place in japan for him to be at that wasn\u2019t the HPSC headquarters, he took the offered seat and slid into the car. Keigo sitting in the passenger seat up front with his driver.\n \u201cWe shall arrive at UA within the hour, sir,\u201d a voice chimed from the driver's seat.\n \u201cThank you Aoki,\u201d he said with a proper smile, one he knew the man would see through the rearview mirror. \nAoki was amazing at his job. The man had been reduced to grunt work despite his skill set due to pissing off the previous president. He, upon noticing this, immediately asked if Aoki would be willing to be promoted to his secretary. The man had agreed readily considering his family and the pay increase, but as time passed- as short as it has been- it was obvious he was enjoying his work a lot more than he did before. He would go as far as saying they were close enough to be called friends now.\n \u201cAlways, sir,\u201d Aoki responded, a soft smile on the usually stern face.\n They pulled out of the complex parking lot and began their way to UA, Keigo belting out his favorite songs as Aoki restrained himself from decking the man as they drove. Noticing this, Keigo began to sing even louder- if that was even possible- which led to Aoki\u2019s patience snapping and a particularly sharp turn led to Keigo\u2019s face being plastered to his own window. A giggle escaped him as he held onto the door to keep upright.\n \u201cApologies for the sharp turn sir, I needed to avoid a pothole.\u201d\n Waving off the words, a smirk on his own face, he turned to look out the window as the world passed by in a blur as they drove. The smirk melting into a satisfied smile as a content sigh passed his lips.\n Things needed changing, and now?\nNow he gets to be the catalyst that starts it all.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\u201cWho\u2019s this cutie?!\u201d Nemuri cooed as she reached out to pet green curls.\n Shouta was sitting next to Nedzu at the head of the monitor room where they were all currently waiting for the written exams to end. They had only been there for a few minutes when Hawks, the current number 3 hero which was impressive for his age, walked in while holding the door open for a kid and another person. The kid was short, reaching what looks to be no taller than 166cm, and had the curliest green hair he has ever seen. Wincing in sympathy, he blew some of his own wild black curls out of his face. He could barely tame his own hair, when he tried, let alone the bird\u2019s nest that was on the newcomers. \nThe other person who had walked in was tall, probably as tall as he was, with a blank look to his face that rivaled his own. Short dark purple hair was slicked back, revealing the almost unnoticeable com in his right ear. A quick glance showed that, sure enough, all three of them had com\u2019s placed inconspicuously on their bodies. If it wasn\u2019t for his experience as an under, he doubted he would\u2019ve noticed them at all.\n \u201cAh, Midnight-san,\u201d the kid greeted, a small nod sent in her direction, \u201cA pleasure. My name is Midoriya Izuku.\u201d\n With a squeal, Nemuri ruffled the kids' curls. Marveling over how soft they were with a slight amount of teasing. Hizashi, who was getting ready to leave for the auditorium, gave a small coo at the kid for acting all formal. Shouta, however, didn\u2019t dare. There was something off about this random kid's appearance that didn\u2019t sit well with him. What kind of kid had access to a com system and the secret observation room for UA\u2019s entrance exams? Not a normal one, that\u2019s for sure. \nThere was also the slight twitch of the purple haired man\u2019s right hand when Nemuri reached to ruffle the kid's curls. An involuntary action that, no matter how much you try, can\u2019t be concealed. One that\u2019s present in most bodyguards that are armed. \nWhoever this kid was, they were being guarded closely. \n His unasked question was answered when sharp green eyes snapped over to the seat next to him, Nedzu\u2019s whiskers twitching with glee. The smile that stretched over freckled cheeks was unnerving at best, but it was the dead eyes that accompanied it that really set him on edge. He\u2019s seen that expression on Nedzu's own furry features several times. \nSuddenly, he remembered the conversation he had with Nedzu about the exam changes with a single moment of clarity before the dread set in.\n No-\n \u201cNedzu-chan,\u201d the kid chirped as the faculty choked, \u201cHow\u2019s the processing so far?\u201d\n Dear god.\n \u201cWell Izuku-chan,\u201d Nedzu greeted just as fondly, uncaring of the shivers he sent down their backs, \u201cit seems to be going quite well! Yamada-kun, if you will?\u201d\n He knew it, the world was ending and it was all this sadist-sunshine child\u2019s fault. There was no way someone got so close to Nedzu without having or adopting some of the rat\u2019s more eccentric tendencies. Sadism is just the best bet at the moment.\n Tentatively, Hizashi nodded as he went to leave. Tossing glances back until the door was fully closed. The room was rendered silent as they observed the kid in front of them happily chatting with Nedzu. Random acronyms and words being tossed in that he hadn\u2019t heard of before and really didn\u2019t want to know either, such as the suspicious combination of letters A.D.M.B. in reference to defense systems.\n \u201cUh, Nedzu-san,\u201d spoke up a hesitant, familiar voice, \u201cwhat is\u2026Uh, Midoriya-kun?\u201d The kid gave a nod, confirming that it was indeed his name, but the all knowing smile that followed it made the man gulp. \u201cMidoriya-kun doing here?\u201d\n \u201cOh? I explained a few days ago that he would be coming, did you forget Yagi-san?\u201d\n Shouta groaned, sounding more like a dying man by the minute, into the silence that followed Nedzu\u2019s statement. The teachers snapped their gazes to him questioningly as he face planted into his own hands.\n \u201cProblem child,\u201d he grumbled, looking up enough to catch Midoriya\u2019s gaze, \u201cI\u2019m not explaining,\u201d he voiced to the rest of the room.\n The kid chuckled, amused eyes that still held that sharpness looked towards Nedzu questioningly. He let out an inaudible sigh of relief, glad that those eyes were off of him now. The brat had the same gaze Nedzu did, one that told you your every move was being considered and deciphered until you were as easy to read as a children's picture book. \n Nedzu gave Midoriya a nod, a feral smile accompanying it as Midoriya turned around to fully address the room.\n \u201cIt\u2019s a bit early, the announcement was going to be delivered a week from now but what's the harm? Let me reintroduce myself,\u201d a blinding smile replaced the polite one from earlier, \u201cMy name is Midoriya Izuku, the current president of the Hero Public Safety Commission.\u201d\nThe room was silent.\n\u201cI look forward to working with you all. Oh! I nearly forgot,\u201d a predatory smile appeared on his face, \u201cit\u2019s a pleasure to meet the number 1, even if it\u2019s the second time, Yagi-san.\u201d\n.\n.\n.\n.\nThe exams progressed smoothly after that, the room of teachers all too shocked to do much else than to fall into autopilot mode. Especially Yagi, who looked to be questioning life itself as he glanced warily at the green child talking amicably with Nedzu in the seats closest to the monitors.\n The new format had three different exam styles that the potential students could choose from based on what they assumed they would excel in. Destructive or \u2018flashy\u2019 quirks could choose the original exam which used the usual battle city scenario with robots, mental or subtle quirks could choose the one-on-one battle scenario where they would fight one of ectoplasm\u2019s clones, or a third exam which no one was given the details to but Nedzu seemed especially happy about. \n At one point during the exam, Midoriya had broken into what could only be called a mutter storm. A hand resting across his mouth as he spoke, twitching as if it wanted to write, muffling the already quiet sound. Nedzu was leaning in, listening intently as Midoriya lost himself to his own thoughts for a good few minutes. At the end of it, Nedzu\u2019s face broke into an animalistic smile that sent shivers down their spines before he reached for the student list. Pawing through it until he reached a specific one, he pulled it out and placed it to the side.\n He was curious (sue him), so he moved towards the front, already knowing he was risking life and limb.\n (Dramatic but also completely acceptable considering who he was getting close to.)\n \u201cAh, hello Eraserhead,\u201d Midoriya greeted cordially. \n He pushed down the urge to shudder, refusing to ask why this child knew his hero name. Yes he was the president of the HPSC, but he was also a president that was newly \u2018elected\u2019. He sincerely doubts the kid had enough time to go through every hero listed in their database, which means his name was either specifically searched for, or the kid knew of him for far longer than he wanted to know.\n He gave a nod in return, already reaching to read the selected paper. \n The photo of the selected student showcased wild purple hair and deep eyebags. \u2018Shinsou Hitoshi\u2019 was the name. The kid obviously needed to work on his stamina, considering he had almost failed the one-on-one tests, but he pulled through with his quirk. \n \u201cCurious?\u201d Midoriya asked, his sharp eyes once again intently staring at him.\n \u201cYes,\u201d he admitted. What good would it do to lie? He\u2019s almost 100% sure he\u2019d be seen through anyways, no matter how good his poker face was.\n \u201cWell, Shinsou-kun needs more focused training for his body, that much is clear, but based on his performance and the potential hidden within his quirk it would be a shame to lose him to the general education track. I do believe your particular brand of teaching would suit him well, don't you?\u201d \n This time he couldn\u2019t hold back the shudder, cursing himself for it as he saw a flash of amusement dancing behind emerald green eyes. There was something unnerving about this kid, something so reminiscent of Nedzu that it made him want to crawl into his sleeping bag and never wake up again. No one needed two Nedzu\u2019s. For fucks sake the world was barely hanging on with just one.\n \u201cYes,\u201d he managed to get out, \u201cI had similar thoughts.\u201d\n \u201cGood!\u201d Nedzu chirped, abruptly reminding them all of his presence. \u201cSince he\u2019s just been accepted into class 1-A.\u201d\n He groaned internally, questioning all of his life choices that led him to this moment. Sighing heavily, which earned him an amused smile from Midoriya, he sagged into the last seat left at the front of the monitoring room. He was already here, might as well stay for the long run. \n \u201cOooh,\u201d Nedzu started, his voice edged in a way that made Shouta sit up straighter, \u201cIt seems you were correct once again Izuku-chan.\u201d\n Midoriya perked up, eyes roaming the screens before it settled on the one showcasing a teen with an explosion quirk. Following his gaze, Shouta cringed at the feral smile that decorated the blonde\u2019s face as he destroyed the robots. Great, another superiority complex having flashy quirk user. \n \u201cAh,\u201d Midoriya said, giving a small nod as if confirming his own thoughts, \u201cOf course. Bakugo has always been very\u2026 aggressive with his approach to heroics.\u201d\n Suddenly, green eyes were on him again as a single eyebrow raised in question, a curious look on Midoriya\u2019s face as he watched his expression intently.\n \u201cSay, Eraserhead,\u201d the teen(?) drawled, \u201chow much do you enjoy destroying world views and correcting societies mistakes when it comes to enforcing biased world views through academic environments?\u201d\n His eyes sharpened as he glanced from the screen then back to Midoriya.\n \u201cAbout a solid 6 on a scale of 10, though I do find it a necessary nuisance.\u201d\n \u201cLovely,\u201d Midoriya chirped before going back to watching the screens, Nedzu pulling another paper out and placing it on top of Shinsou\u2019s.\n This is how the exam watching progressed for the next few hours. Random interruptions from Nedzu and Midoriya as they talked to each other, and occasionally himself, watching the students finish their exams. By the end, there were already two stacks of potential applicants for both Vlad and himself to go through. Each stack tailored based on who would do good under which teaching style. Midoriya stood up with a polite smile, a more genuine one than the one he had from when he walked in, heading to the door where Hawks and the other were standing at attention.\n \u201cWell, I\u2019m afraid that I must head out, though I enjoyed my time here. Thank you for the invitation, Nedzu-chan,\u201d Midoriya said, words soft and joyful.\n \u201cOf course Izuku-chan! I\u2019m just sorry that we\u2019ll need to push back tea time, considering how busy we\u2019ll both be very soon. Your insights on the exam were certainly informative!\u201d The rat responded, tail switching in delight.\n With a final dismissal, the teen left and the room plunged into silence once again. Each of the teachers stared at each other in the same bewilderment from earlier. That was until Hizashi walked through the door, a strained smile on his face before he spoke.\n \u201cSo, our new boss is a very green- adorable- sunshine child? How did that even happen?\u201d\n The only response was the delighted cackles from Nedzu.\n\n\u201cShishido-san, the President requests your presence in his office.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nShishido Hisao, having been in the middle of staring aimlessly at the ceiling for several minutes by then, startled at the sound of someone speaking to him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSpinning his chair around, he came face to face with someone he never imagined he would ever see in his entire life while working at the HPSC. Standing there, hair styled back to reveal the full force of the apathetic face he was wearing, was Tsugikuni Aoki. The fucking secretary of the \n\nPresident of the HPSC\n\n. The \n\nPresident\n\n. What the fuck was the secretary of the President standing here in the offices-\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWait a damn minute-\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cM-\u201d he coughed, clearing his throat before speaking once more, \u201cMe? The president is asking for me?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nTsugikuni raised an eyebrow.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIs your name Shishido?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThen yes, he is. Follow me,\u201d Tsugikuni stated curtly before spinning on his heel and headed for the elevator.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nScrambling, Hisao snapped out of his chair and hurried after his superior. His superior by a whole lot. Only a single person stands above the secretary and it's the president. The \n\npresident\n\n. No, he hasn\u2019t freaked out enough over this yet. Thoughts like \u2018God what the actual fuck was happening in his life?\u2019, \u2018What did he do wrong?\u2019, and \u2018Why him?\u2019 running through his head as he caught up.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe elevator ride itself was extremely uncomfortable, like being a rabbit trapped in the same cage as a wolf. He hated every single second of it. Dread crawled up his spine as the numbers displaying what floor they were on went up, and up, and \n\nup\n\n. How many fucking floors were there anyways?!? He never passed the first 10! He would rather be in a fucking meeting where the speakers went over the\n\n same goddamn topics\n\n every single time for \n\nhours\n\n on end then be heading towards the Presidents office. He felt remarkably similar to a criminal on death row, walking his way towards the guillotine.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe hadn\u2019t even met the previous president! He just received orders down the grape vine of superiority complexes and did what he was told so that he wouldn\u2019t mysteriously disappear one day! Hell, it's the worst kept secret of the HPSC that the current president got his seat by \u2018\n\nsuggesting\u2019 \n\nthat it be passed over. That kind of person viscerally terrifies him at his core.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe past president had been horrible, but to dangle blackmail at said horribly terrifying president and coerce them into giving up their seat despite how greedy they are? Well that just means the current president is a fucking demon, thats what.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNo human he knows of is capable of that.\n\n\u00a0\n\nEven Nedzu, labeled the \u2018HPSC\u2019s pain in the ass\u2019 for his ability to fuck with them, hadn\u2019t been able to push that far.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe ding of the elevator chimed that lovely chime it always does and Hisao wanted to toss himself through the ceiling-to-floor windows that decorated the long hallway the doors opened to. Too bad the President's secretary was now turning his vibrant violet eyes towards him, that same impeccably blank facial expression seemed incredibly intimidating despite its lack of\u2026 anything really. He\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019s seen sculptures with more expression than this man. So Hisao did what anyone else would do when faced with a similar situation. He turned towards the long hallway and began to walk.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nGod he wanted to \n\ncry\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTsugikuni followed him closely, quite literally only two steps behind him, and it felt like being escorted by a police officer to a jail cell, or, once again a criminal being escorted to their inevitable death.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe hallway to the president's office was, as stated previously, long. It took over 5 minutes of walking to even see the doorway. What was the point of having such a long ass hallway?!? Intimidation purposes?!?\n\n\u00a0\n\nActually, that\u2019s probably \n\nexactly \n\nwhy it was built like this.\n\n\u00a0\n\nCongrats, he\u2019s thoroughly intimidated.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nOnce they reached the door, Tsugikuni took the lead and knocked on expensive looking mahogany wood. Well, he\u2019s pretty sure it's mahogany. He might not know much about wood types but he\u2019s pretty sure those rich CEO offices in the TV dramas all used mahogany so he\u2019s kinda just assuming.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe door opened and Hisao felt himself lose just a little bit more of his sanity as \n\nHawks \n\nleaned up against the entryway. Piercing gold eyes scanning over them before landing on Hisao and lingering for a good minute before a charming smile broke out across his face.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt wasn\u2019t comforting in the slightest.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn fact, Hisao felt \n\nhunted\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cCome on in, the president is expecting you,\u201d Hawks chirped, stepping away so that he could walk through the door.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHisao crossed the threshold and walked a bit further before he heard the sharp click of a door closing shut. A quick glance showed both Tsugikuni and Hawks standing beside the door at attention. Returning his attention back to infront of him, Hisao audibly gulped as he stared at the back of the office chair in front of him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHow cliche of the \n\nPresident \n\nof the fucking \n\nHero Public Safety\u00a0\n\nCommission.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe was going to have a full blown breakdown at this rate.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSir,\u201d he started, voice wavering with nerves and he silently cursed himself for it, \u201cyou called for me?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI did!\u201d A voice chirped, a \n\nyoung \n\nsounding voice.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSuddenly, the chair spun around and Hisao could physically feel the years being chopped off his life span as he went through several revelations in the span of a second.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThere's a few questions I wish to ask you about concerning the documents that pass through your desk,\u201d Midoriya Izuku- according to the nameplate on his desk- said, sharp green eyes staring directly through his soul as he smiled, \u201cand a few regarding to the orders you received concerning those documents, if you don\u2019t mind \n\nthoroughly \n\nexplaining.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe president of the HPSC was a teenager.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nA teenager had blackmailed the government and \n\nwon\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d he said, feeling resigned even as his eyes burned with unshed tears, \u201cI\u2019ll start from the beginning then, sir.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThat poor, \n\npoor \n\nman,\u201d Keigo lamented, staring at the now closed door that Shishido-san had just left through, \u201che was shivering Boss Man. Absolutely terrified. If I hadn\u2019t experienced a similar situation first hand it would\u2019ve been funny.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cTch,\u201d Aoki clicked his tongue, shaking his head slightly in admonishment before he headed over to his section of the office. A smaller desk was placed off to the side just for him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nKeigo\u2019s feathers ruffled in a pattern Izuku was getting used to recognizing as amusement before he straightened them out, turning from facing the door to looking over his desk as he worked. Aoki and Keigo had developed a unique friendship over the last few weeks, honestly it reminded him of siblings in a way. Aoki\u2019s sarcasm and spite versus Keigo\u2019s little sibling syndrome.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cEh,\u201d Izuku started, pushing a green curl behind his ear as he shifted the documents placed before him, \u201ca little bit of trauma is fine. Adds some spice to life.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nKeigo snorted before stretching, leisurely walking his way towards the office door as he waved his hand through the air in a lazy goodbye.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m heading out for my patrol Boss Man,\u201d Keigo called, tilting his head back to send him a wink, \u201ctry not to have too much fun without me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWell Kei,\u201d Izuku responded, a slow and sharp smile stretching across his face as he read over the newest document he had just grabbed, \u201cI\u2019d rather not make promises I can\u2019t keep.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nWith a rather decisive twist of his wrist, Izuku placed his official signature on the police request form he had found beneath a stack of paperwork. Holding it up to show a curious Keigo who had stopped in the doorway.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMind handing this to Detective Tsukauchi of the Musutafu police department for me? I think he\u2019ll be rather delighted to receive this.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nKeigo sent a feather and retrieved the paper, gold eyes scanning over the document with impressive speed before he choked. Eyes wide as he snapped his gaze to his own, hissing out words faster than he\u2019s ever heard the man speak.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c\n\nDid you just casually sign a warrant for an internal investigation as if it was a field trip permission slip?\n\n\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n(First Day of the New School Year)\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cGood Morning,\u201d Nedzu chirped, his tail wiggling a bit in excitement as he sat on the staff lounge\u2019s couch.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nConsidering class was supposed to start within the hour, all of the faculty were there to jump in surprise at his sudden presence. All but one. Shouta had always been hyper aware of things when he was a student, especially when it concerned himself. He had wanted to cultivate that talent so he did. He was glad his lessons seemed to help quite a bit, he never really could startle the man anymore unless he was actively focusing on him specifically, Shouta was one of the few humans Nedzu considered a friend.\n\n\u00a0\n\nA chorus of greetings echoed in the room as the clearly exhausted faculty tried to wake up before dealing with, and he quotes, \u201cdemon children born from the culmination of human sin\u201d.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNedzu,\u201d Shouta\u2019s gruff voice cut through the air and the room went silent, the man had sounded\u00a0\nwary, \"what\u00a0did you do?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nInstantly, several pairs of eyes snapped to him with unveiled terror. The air in the room grew heavy under the weight of the tension. Unable to help himself, Nedzu grinned. All sharp and bared teeth as he stared at them all. Amused as he watched his faculty shudder in fear before he spoke.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHow harsh Shouta-kun,\u201d he said, reigning back his elation and smoothing the grin into a polite smile, \u201cI\u2019m just excited for a segment that will be happening in about,\u201d he glanced at the clock on the wall and grinned once again, \u201ca minute or two.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat segmen-\u201d Vlad had started before he was cut off by a cheery chime that seemed to resonate in the room.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSuddenly, the lights of the faculty room dimmed and a rather large section of the wall behind him started to open to reveal a screen. Playing on the flat screen tv was the local new station, the speakers in the room instantly syncing up to the audio.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOfficially,\u201d the news reporter started, his voice echoing in the room as the faculty stared at the screen in silence, \u201cas of an hour ago, the president of the Hero Public Safety Commission has changed. The change of power was done yesterday evening and according to the statement they released on the matter, the current President\u2019s name is Midoriya Izuku. Currently, there is no more information regarding who, or what the new President intends to\u2026\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Nedzu started once the volume died down again, \u201ctime for the start of the new year! Good luck with your students everyone, plus ultra!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n(A Week Into the School Year)\n\n\n \u201cI\u2019m this close to strangling the man,\u201d Shouta hissed, hair fidgeting around his shoulders as he glared towards the ceiling of his apartment.\n\u00a0\n\nDeft hands gently worked through his hair, scratching lightly in a soothing motion that helped him calm down. He sighed as he let the tension seep out of him, going boneless on Hizashi\u2019s lap.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cUnderstandable,\u201d his sunshine agreed, looking down at him through his casual glasses and a Shouta\u2019s breath hitched at the quiet panic hidden behind green and red eyes, \u201cI\u2019m just glad that the alarms had been triggered when they did. If someone had managed to jam the signal, or if you had headed in with your class any sooner I-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nReaching up, Shouta gently cupped Hizashi\u2019s cheek. He felt his face softening at the genuine worry that was twisting his sunshines expression. He might hate worrying Hizashi, but to see how much Hizashi cared about him had that warm spot reserved for the blonde flaring hot.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt's okay Hizashi,\u201d he murmured, thumb soothing over Hizashi\u2019s cheek, \u201cit's all in the past now. It won't do you any good to think of the \u2018what if\u2019s\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cTrue,\u201d Hizashi conceded, a soft smile appeared on his face before a glimmer of mirth settled in his eyes, \u201cI guess I should focus more on how the higher ups will handle this.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nCurious, he raised an eyebrow. Silently asking Hizashi to continue.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWell, the attack had to be reported to the commission you know? Now, I\u2019m not a hundred percent positive about it, but the green bean seemed a little hostile towards Yagi didn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe had been. Shouta could remember the way Midoriya\u2019s eyes had bore into the Number 1 with the kind of cutthroat calculation he remembers seeing on Nedzu\u2019s face back when he was dealing with the old president. It had been intriguing to see, especially considering the kids' age. Most teens were still stuck with their rose tinted glasses and worshiped the very ground the man walked on. However, one doesn\u2019t become the president of the HPSC at Midoriya\u2019s age with rose tinted glasses.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe must\u2019ve had a fucking magnifying glass to get where he was.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe gave Hizashi a small nod, agreeing that he \n\nhad \n\nnoticed the hostility. Noting his nod, Hizashi continued while still gently removing tangles and knots from his hair.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI had heard Nedzu talking with Nao earlier about the break in and he had said something about a \u2018friend coming to help me deal with the situation\u2019. We both know that Nedzu doesn\u2019t consider many people \n\nfriends \n\nso that statement was probably referring to Greenie.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cTrue,\u201d he drawled, remembering the time Nedzu gave him a 3 hour long lecture on how trust is dangerous if given to the wrong people.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNow considering the villains had apparently shown up to kill All Might, who wasn\u2019t even there yet due to being late, and add that on to the really weird circumstances surrounding his employment that we aren\u2019t privy to\u2026\u201d He trailed off, glancing back down at Shouta with a raised eyebrow.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d he realized, eyes widening as they stared at each other.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe room was silent for a long moment, the soft sound of pattering paws from cats being the only interruption. Then, at the same time, wide smirks broke out across their faces.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI would give my left kidney to be there during that meeting,\u201d Hizashi smirked, eyes bright with glee.\n\n\u00a0\n\nA ping rang out from both of their phones and Shouta instantly recognized the sound.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt seems we just might get too,\u201d he snickered, while grabbing his phone.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSure enough, right there in his notifications was Nedzu requesting the presence of all the hero faculty in one of the more secured meeting rooms the next day at 9am sharp. Turning his phone, he showed his screen to Hizashi who burst into a fit of cackles.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe was going to \n\nenjoy \n\nthis meeting.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n(A Day Later, Early Morning)\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe was right, he was enjoying the hell out of this meeting.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDressed in a perfectly tailored suit, all black besides the deep emerald tie that was held in place by a Hawks pin for some odd reason, Midoriya Izuku sat at the head of the U shaped table in the meeting room. Legs crossed as he leaned back into his chair with the documents detailing the entirety of the break-in held securely in his lap with a hand. The other occasionally flipped the pages for him to read or grabbed the teacup Nedzu had placed in front of him to drink. Nedzu himself had perched on the unoccupied arm of Midoriya\u2019s chair, occasionally answering any questions the teen had about the papers.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhere was All Might?\n\n\u00a0\n\nA seat, that looked soft at first glance but he knew better, had been placed right in the middle of the U shaped table. Completely isolated from the rest of the faculty and put on display for all to see. The man was \n\nsweating\n\n. Eyes anxiously glancing around the room as the silence wore on. His frail, \n\nreal\n\n, body was shivering with nerves.\n\n\n\n\n\nNot a single soul tried to help.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt was \n\nbeautiful\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHmmm,\u201d Midoriya hummed, flipping to the last page, \u201cthis \n\nis \n\nrather concerning.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe room was still silent, everyone seemingly on edge. Well, it \n\nwas \n\na bit nerve-inducing to have the person who holds their very careers in the palms of his hands sitting in the same room. He, however, was too busy focusing on the way Yagi had flinched at Midoriya\u2019s cold tone. The vindictive and petty part of him preening a bit at the sight of it.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt is,\u201d Nedzu agreed, his usual polite smile replaced by a solemn one as he turned to speak with Midoriya, \u201cI would apologize for dragging you away from the numerous things you would no doubt need to deal with as a newly elected President, however, this takes precedence.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, I probably would have involved myself the minute I caught wind of this anyways,\u201d Midoriya sighed before placing the document on the table in front of him, \u201cfor now I\u2019ve got my secretary overlooking the\u2026 \n\nprojects \n\nI\u2019ve started. He\u2019ll keep everything running smoothly while I\u2019m out.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d Midoriya started, eyes snapping towards Yagi before they settled with a cold calculative look piercing the man, \u201cIt seems we have much to discuss about the USJ Incident. The \u2018League of Villains\u2019, or so they call themselves, have made their point quite clear- and based on reports it seems they\u2019ve invested enough into it to be a bigger problem than previously expected.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nYagi shivered under the look Midoriya was giving him, eyes darting around the room in a futile attempt to avoid the teen\u2019s gaze. Against his wishes, Shouta found himself a little impressed at how good Midoriya was at unsettling people with a mere look.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNow, while having the symbol of peace- a man with countless enemies- would be a danger to have as a school staff member,\u201d Yagi flinched at the thinly veiled jab, \u201cespecially having it publicly announced, I find it rather intriguing that there is a noticeable difference between the time you were scheduled to arrive at work and,\u201d a snap echoed from Midoriya and suddenly the ceiling opened up to lower a screen out of it, \u201cthe last time your hero ID was used to register a point of activity in the system as \u2018completed\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nShouta leaned forward slightly, curious despite the situation. He knew the HPSC had a way of cataloging the hero licenses they issue but the heroes themselves aren\u2019t allowed to see the database. The only people with access to it are kept on a list and placed in a specific department he\u2019s only heard whispers about.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nOn the screen was a list that was categorized based on year-month-day-time in that order. It was a large chart-like list with a single ID number repeated over and over that he realized was All Might\u2019s. The referenced times highlighted in a bright obnoxious yellow, the exact same shade as the one the hero himself wears. He knew. He knew Midoriya was a petty, spiteful, \n\nsadistic \n\nteenager. It was still nice to have confirmation. The teen even had the nerve to put the referenced times- already highlighted with that obnoxious yellow- in bold with an underline.\n\n\u00a0\n\nShouta approves.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m remembering correctly,\u201d Midoriya stated slowly, as if speaking to a child, \u201cUA has it stated in their contracts that unless suitable forewarnings or reasons are given, all teachers are expected to arrive on time and attend the classes they are placed in an authoritative position over. Failure to do so has consequences they must face which range from verbal reprimands to an unverified amount of time where the violator will be subjected to the N.E.Z.U. protocol.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo explain to me, Yagi-san,\u201d Midoriya stated, a sickeningly sweet smile stretching across his face, \u201cI\u2019m curious. What reasons do you have to neglect the job you had asked for? One my predecessor had taken certain \n\nactions \n\nto make sure you received?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c\n\nOh shit\n\n,\u201d he heard someone whisper into the silence, Nemuri\u2019s gobsmacked face coming into view when he turned to see who said it.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOh shit indeed.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n(Same Day Later Time At HPSC Headquarters)\n\n\u00a0\n\nIzuku ran his gaze over those presently sitting at the large oval table the meeting was taking place at. Taking the time to do so, he counted each of the board members that had arrived on time for the meeting he scheduled. Some were late, the type that comes from negligence and not out of unfortunate events, but he had already expected that.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSatisfied that his expectations were correct, he leaned over to grab the tea cup that was placed before him on the table. He could feel the eyes pinned on him as he moved and had to push down the smile that he felt twitching his lips. It would do no good to antagonize them\u2026\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2026yet.\n\n\u00a0\n\nLooking at his watch, Izuku noted that the time to start the meeting had just passed. He would give them 10 minutes. !0 minutes to arrive and be in their seats before he resorted to calling in a bit of help. That seemed reasonable.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBy the time 10 minutes had passed, however, there were still 3 board members missing. Unfortunate but not entirely unexpected, though he had hoped for better.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nDisappointments till the very end.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d he started, placing his tea cup down as he addressed the room, \u201cI believe it\u2019s in our best interest to get started despite the missing members. Unfortunate.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut, once again, not unexpected.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou never specified what this meeting would be about,\u201d a man named Miyaharu Hotaru called out, looking incredibly unimpressed, \u201cMidoriya-kun.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nIzuku, who knows how manners work, smiled politely before speaking.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he allowed, \u201cthough, Miyaharu-\n\nsan\n\n, I do believe my station warrants such secrecy? Especially considering that today will be focusing on several topics labeled under classified?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cTrue,\u201d the man responded, his eyebrow twitching in annoyance, \u201cthough your lack of explanation must\u2019ve interfered with your desire with punctuality, they probably were stuck with more important matters that are taking longer than expected. We are very busy people after all.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo the board members, people who report to the president directly, believe that my requests are optional?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nIzuku let the silence sit for a second, his smile widening slightly when no one spoke.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBesides,\u201d he sent a pointed glance towards the name plate that sat in front of him, the word \u2018president\u2019 engraved in elegant scrawl, \u201cI\u2019m quite busy myself. There are quite a few things that require my attention.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nRunning his gaze over the people present once more, he watched as they shifted and squirmed in their seats. Obviously, this meeting isn\u2019t going how they expected. He knew long before Miyaharu decided to use the wrong honorific that their entitled attitudes were premeditated. Leaning over the table once again, he tapped the table right beside where his name plate was. A beep echoed in the silence and he smiled.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAoki, send someone to retrieve my \n\nemployees\n\n,\u201d he called out, enjoying the offended and enraged expression on Miyaharu\u2019s face, \u201cthey seem to be a bit lost.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Aoki responded, an amused edge to his voice that he knew only he could hear.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe call ended with another beep and Izuku relaxed into his chair. Tossing one leg over the other as he brought a hand up to gesture at the documents in front of him.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSince we have time, why don\u2019t you go ahead and read the itinerary for today's meeting?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYOU CAN'T DO THIS!\u201d Miyaharu spat, his face fading into a concerningly bright red as he screamed, \u201cYOU DON\u2019T HAVE THE AUTHORITY!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nWincing at the volume, Izuku sighed as he once again gestured to his name plate while raising an eyebrow.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he dryly stated, \u201cYes I do.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nBehind him, Detective Tsukauchi nodded despite his head being tucked down as he read off the list of crimes Miyaharu was being arrested for- which was extensive compared to the lists for the others so far- along with several other board members. Though, even if he couldn\u2019t see his face, Izuku knew he was holding back laughter due to the slight shake of his shoulders. There were several similar shouts from the other people being arrested but, frankly, Izuku could care less.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIf you hadn\u2019t broken any laws and abused your given powers, we wouldn\u2019t be having this conversation. Instead, though, I get to sit here and watch as you are restrained with the same metal cuffs the HPSC provides for high profile targets that need maximum security. I do hope you\u2019ll reflect on your actions,\u201d he sighed, sending the man a look that conveyed his repulsion, \u201cbut I sincerely doubt you will. I\u2019ll let you handle it from here Detective.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nGetting up, Izuku sent a nod in the detective's direction as he walked out the back door. Aoki fell into step behind him once he exited the room and they headed for the private elevator that leads to his office.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI have the applicants you chose sitting in the lobby room, will you be addressing them all together or one by one?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAll together,\u201d he responded back, grabbing the papers Aoki had been holding for him, \u201cI don\u2019t have the time to conduct one on one meetings at the moment. They\u2019ve already been cleared by Tsuka anyway. Have the necessary people been informed of the structural change?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes Sir,\u201d Aoki stepped forward and pressed the button for the elevator, \u201cI\u2019ve also set up the gala where the changes will be announced.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d he commented, only half paying attention as he read through the papers detailing the skills of the applicants he was about to meet, \u201cI\u2019ll have you handle the invitations personally. I don\u2019t trust them to get to the right people as it stands. Any messages?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cJust two,\u201d Aoki handed over his phone as they loaded onto the elevator, \u201cNedzu requests your time table so that he can set up a tea and chess session.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cGo ahead and send it over, He\u2019ll pick out a convenient date. Though, do remind him that crashing the gala- no matter how fun arson sounds- would be a pain and I\u2019d rather not need to coerce him into paying therapy fees for his collateral damage.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDone. Also, Inko-san was wondering if you\u2019ll be home for dinner.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s \n\nkatsudon \n\nnight, Aoki.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cUnderstood, I\u2019ll let her know to expect you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe elevator dinged and they stepped out, heading straight for the office he had gotten rather attached to in the last few weeks. There seemed to be millions of things to do, problems popping up one right after the other, but he wouldn\u2019t change it for the world.\n\n\nThings were changing, and he was going to make sure it \n\nstuck\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt's a pleasure to meet you Eraserhead,\u201d the teal haired man said, looking like they would rather be anywhere but there in that moment and he agreed, \u201cMy name is Takahashi Kaze, as introduced during the gala, and I\u2019ll be the head of the UHN section of the HPSC. Considering your rating- after we compiled all of your data and records during your time as a hero- which sits firmly as the top underground hero the HPSC has, you\u2019ll be seeing me an unfortunate amount of times most likely.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d Takahashi-san said, head nodding sagely, \u201cit must be surprising to hear considering the HPSC\u2019s shitty structural systems from previous leadership but it's true. Your arrest record, raid participation, mission completions, descelation skills, lack of extreme force, efficiency. Add it all up and you rank higher than every other hero we have working in the Underground. Same for the spotlights as well but they don\u2019t matter to me. Not my department.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nShouta stared at his new superior, Midoriya having separated the HPSC into three types of heroes, spotlight, twilight, and underground. Within those three sections there were also the differences between healing, combat, and rescue. It has led to an increase in effectiveness in terms of regulating those in the profession and keeping tabs on them closer than before to prevent any toxic and corrupt situations from arising again. But that was besides the point, currently he was still trying to process what the ever-loving-fuck Takahashi had just said.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhy would I be seeing you more often,\u201d he decided on, ignoring the whole fuck-ton of revelations- it was really only one giant one but still- that was dumped on him within minutes of arriving here.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIf it was even possible, Takahasi looked even more done with this scenario.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my job to handle large operations and delegate them to Heroes that might be able to handle them. When I mean large, I mean League of Villains snooping around and developing a large fucking spiderweb big enough to trip a metal giant off the side of a cliff if your not careful kind of large operation,\u201d he sighed, \u201csuch as the one you are involved in already.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAh.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYep,\u201d Takahashi-san said, looking grim, \u201cso here, the full file regarding the information we managed to dig up out of our previous board of directors offices. Surprising right?\u201d The man looked anything but surprised about the thick file folder placed on his desk.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d he sighed.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBoth of them sat there for a second in silence, just staring at the folder on Takahashi\u2019s desk as they contemplated their lives for a second. Then, once the silence sat just a little too long, Takahashi turned to grab another folder and pen to start working again.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s coffee on the right in the breakroom, have at it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThanks.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNedzu,\u201d Izuku greeted, smiling warmly at the screen of his computer where he had just answered his friend's video call, \u201cwhat can I help you with?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIzuku-chan,\u201d Nedzu greeted back just as warmly, \u201cI wanted to check in with you a bit for when you will be available for the next tea session? It hasn\u2019t been long since the last but I would quite enjoy a relaxing time talking with a friend.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d he snapped his head over to his schedule, double checking the date he had circled in red before looking back at Nedzu. \u201cI was just about to send you the date actually! I had a feeling you would after everything that's happened.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWonderful!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYour first-years applied for entrance to the provisional licensing exam that's being held in a month, I just so happen to have that specific day off. I think having tea while watching the newest batch of heroes in training sounds like a good way to spend a day together, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c\n\nDelightful\n\n,\u201d Nedzu chirped, \u201cabsolutely, I\u2019ll clear my day.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo need,\u201d he responded, dropping his voice into a sugary sweet tone, \u201cI\u2019ve gone ahead and taken the liberty of\u2026 adjusting your schedule. It appears Yagi-san will just have to have that meeting next month, pity.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cA pity indeed,\u201d the chimera mused, a sharp grin spreading across animalistic features before he cracked and started to cackle \n\nloudly\n\n. Honestly he\u2019s pretty sure he heard the principal's door slam back shut during his moment of laughter and it tipped him over into his own set of chuckles.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNedzu? You were coming along?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nShouta, who was currently being used as the principal\u2019s form of transportation, huffed. He and Vlad were wrangling all the first-year heroics classes onto their respective buses, or well, he was until he had been called by Nedzu. Apparently the rat wanted to tag along for some reason- he absolutely knows what that reason is but is avoiding it out of necessity- so he had been turned into a shuttle bus for the chimera.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d the principal nodded, a cheery smile on his face.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSir!\u201d He heard from behind and barely held back the groan that wanted to escape him.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHow \n\nwas this child related to terror Tensei in \n\nany \n\nway.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d Iida Tenya, honorary nephew and stickler for the rules, fumbled at the sight of Nedzu, \u201cPrincipal Nedzu! It is an honor to be within your presence today sir!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo need for the formalities, Iida-kun!\u201d Nedzu chirped, his open expression replaced by the polite formal one he adopts for most people he isn\u2019t close to. \u201cI\u2019m just hitching a ride to see a friend-\u201d Goddamn it he \n\nknew \n\nthat was the case \u201c- and it's technically my day off. So no worries!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cUgh,\u201d he slipped, letting his thoughts show for a moment and was rewarded with a truly feral grin from his old mentor. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe would rather be crawling his way through the mud in a forest as skinwalkers crawl towards him than be anywhere near Nedzu right now, and yet he is cursed to walk around aimlessly with a cosmic 'kick me' sign attached to his spiritual back. He has beef with the spiritual deities that had allowed his existence, obviously there was some miscommunication happening because no way in hell has his soul sinned enough to be forced through this nightmare.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cShall we get ready to depart?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cLovely,\u201d Nedzu hopped off his shoulder and began walking towards class 1-A\u2019s bus because of course he did, he always did enjoy messing with people like that, \u201ccome along, Shouta-kun!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNow make sure to pay attention and use your lessons to the best of your abilities, plus ultra and all that,\u201d Aizawa-sensei droned from the front of the group, his monotone indifference actually soothing part of his nerves, \u201cyes, Uraraka?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nTilting his head to get a look, Hitoshi eyed the bob cut of Uraraka from where she was standing in front of him with a hand raised. He couldn\u2019t think of anything that needed clarification so\u2026\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSensei,\u201d Uraraka chirped, voice tinged with curiosity, \u201cwhat's with those mirrors up at the top of the building?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nLooking up, he caught sight of what Uraraka was pointing towards. Sure enough, at the top of the stadium was a box-like room- kind of like those radio/announcer booths you find at pro sports games- that was outfitted with mirrored glass to prevent any onlookers from seeing who was inside. He \n\nalso \n\nrealized why she was asking.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nIf that was the judges booth, then they\u2019ll know when and where to do certain moves within or out of sight. How on brand for the Todosquad, that chaotic law breaking group of chaos.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt's not the judges booth, if that's why you're asking,\u201d Aizawa stated tiredly, slumping even further into his scarf, \u201cthe judges will be placed in several areas among the audience while also having video feed to go over during the final scores stage. That box, however, is still important to consider.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe class paid rapt attention as they saw the look of pure dread on their teacher's face. Just what could have caused Sensei to look like \n\nthat\n\n?\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat box,\u201d Aizawa continued, heaving a sigh, \u201cis where the president of the HPSC sits in order to get an eagle eyed view over the stadium. Normally it's unoccupied but considering this is the first year they have permitted a full class of first-years\u2026\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe class was \n\nfrozen\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat's right!\u201d Nedzu, their principal, cheerily called out from next to Aizawa (when in the hell did he get there?!?). \u201cNow if you excuse me, I have a meeting with the president to attend.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNedzu,\u201d came the toneless yet still somehow sharp voice of Tsugikuni, the secretary positioned off to the side where he was holding open an \u2018employees only\u2019 door, \u201cthe president requests your presence.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Nedzu nodded politely, \u201cdid he receive the gift I sent prior?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Tsugikuni nodded, allowing Nedzu to slip past him, \u201cHe wished for me to inform you that he appreciates the sentiment and is particularly fond of the cinnamon notes within the tea.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI thought he might like-\u201d and that's where the conversation cut off, the door having closed behind them.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d Kaminari piped up from beside him, \u201cnot only are we a year behind everyone here all while we compete under close scrutiny from hardass judges, but the \n\nPresident \n\nof the \n\nHPSC \n\nis going to be watching us.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cLanguage,\u201d Aizawa reprimanded, but the usual heat wasn\u2019t there.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re fucked,\u201d Kirishima softly voiced, eyes wide.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c\n\nLanguage\n\n.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere's the heat.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOverall, they had actually done pretty okay considering the circumstances. 18 out of 20 was an extremely high passing percentage apparently. Honestly they weren\u2019t even expected to have a 50% passing rate, so the fact that the only real reason 2 of them didn\u2019t pass was because of nit picking is impressive.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNot that Bakugo was taking that very well.\n\n\u00a0\n\nStudiously ignoring the ticking time bomb that was Bakugo in the corner of the room, Hitoshi walked over to where Aizawa had called for them to come closer.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAlright,\u201d the man sighed, \u201cwe\u2019ll be heading out after we get the case filled with your provisional licenses. When we get back to UA you ca-\u201d a knock cut the man off.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cCome in?\u201d Aizawa said, raising an eyebrow towards the door that was just out of view from the rest of them.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAizawa-san,\u201d a familiar voice called out before red entered Hitoshi\u2019s vision, a gasp escaping him at the sight of who had knocked on the door, \u201cyou busy?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHawks,\u201d their teacher responded, acting very casual despite the \n\nnumber 2 hero\n\n being the one he was addressing, crossing his arms as he turned to face the hero, \u201cwhy, is there something you needed?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe looked hesitant about that. Obviously the man doesn\u2019t want to leave them alone, and together, considering their rather impressive track record with villains.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYep,\u201d came the cheeky response, Hawks leaning lazily against the door as he spoke, \u201cbut you can bring your kiddies along with. I fear the extended length of time that Nedzu has spent with Bossman and request that you end that immediately.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cFuck,\u201d Aizawa cursed, startling them all. He was pretty sure Ashido\u2019s jaw actually unhinged a bit as she gaped, \u201cwhy are they still together? The exam ended an \n\nhour \n\nago.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cProbably has to do with your little gremlins,\u201d Hawks hummed, glancing over them all, \u201cI know the reason the president stayed for the exam today was so that he could see them in action.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nOh look at that, confirmation that they were the reason the President was here.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThat's not terrifying \n\nat all\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cGreat,\u201d Aizawa flatly stated, \u201cjust great. Lead the way then.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe class of 20 plus the two pro\u2019s walked together in a group, looking remarkably similar to ducklings following their parents as they went through the behind the scenes sections of the stadium. Walking up several sets of stairs and ignoring the blatant cooing the staff was doing over their appearance. It took a couple minutes to get to where they were going, but he recognized exactly where they were when they arrived.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYo,\u201d Hawks called out while he knocked an unfamiliar pattern into the door, \u201cBossman, I brought some ducklings and a very tired looking hobo!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nA few of his classmates snorted, rushing to cover it up when a glowing red glare snapped over to pierce through them with its intensity.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe door was pushed open by the same guy who had come to collect their Principal, their short purple hair impeccably slicked back and violet eyes staring emotionlessly at Hawks as they sighed.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou love me,\u201d Hawks cooed.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cLike a particularly stubborn fungus,\u201d the man replied blithely before opening the door all the way, \u201cin.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOffensive,\u201d Hawks cackled, walking past the man as he glared at him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey all followed in a single file line as they crossed the threshold, curious eyes snapping to the two figures that sat on comfy looking armchairs as they played chess using what looked to be an \n\nexpensive \n\nchess piece set. There was a full tea set off to the side and a stack of papers on the opposite side of that. He would be more curious about that stack of papers, it seemed ominous in the same way Aizawa smiling during homeroom- or at all- did, but his attention had been grabbed by the person playing chess with their principal.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d the unfamiliar figure who sat across from Nedzu started, a choked noise erupting from somewhere in the room, \u201cAizawa-san, a pleasure.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHitoshi glanced around, trying to find who had choked at the sight of who he was 89% sure was the president despite his looks, and almost gaped when he saw who it was. Bakugo, feral pomeranian with hell\u2019s flames licking at his heels and a temper that could melt steel, was pale as a sheet. Face turned several concerning shades white as he began to \n\ntremble\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMidoriya-san,\u201d Aizawa returned in what could be considered a polite tone, \n\nbowing slightly \n\nto the teen who sat in the chair, \u201ca shared sentiment. Now, I was told to retrieve my boss?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhich one?\u201d Nedzu chirped, a cheerful grin stretching across his face.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNot funny,\u201d Aizawa sighed.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI for one,\u201d Hawks piped up, \u201cfind it hilarious.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOf course you do,\u201d Midoriya responded, giving an indulging nod from where he sat, \u201cyou seem the type.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe fuck is that supposed to mean?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d Midoriya continued, cutting off the incredulous response from Hawks, \u201cI assume this is your class of baby hero hatchlings?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cLike you weren\u2019t watching them from here earlier,\u201d Aizawa said, looking as if he would rather be anywhere then here at this moment.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHmmm,\u201d Midoriya hummed, choosing to remain silent before calling out a, \u201cTsugikuni?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSir,\u201d the man who had opened the door, Tsugikuni apparently, responded immediately.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAre their licenses ready?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes, sir. I had assumed this would happen so I had them brought up.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWonderful,\u201d Midoriya breathed, standing up fluidly while straightening out his impeccable suit. The crisp three-piece black suit was highlighted by a deep emerald green dress shirt.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHitoshi has never felt underdressed in his life, to tired or deprived of fucks to give when it comes to other peoples opinions, but even he has to admit Midoriya makes him feel like he had just walked into a formal gala wearing the equivalent to an Adam Sandler outfit. He was dressed in his UA uniform, arguably a more formal option for him to choose, but it didn\u2019t help.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThere we go,\u201d Midoriya said, cutting through his thoughts, as he grabbed a briefcase from Tsugikuni, \u201cnow, may I do the honors?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI honestly couldn\u2019t care any less,\u201d Aizawa said, apparently having given up in more than one way at this point.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cPerfect.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe next 30 minutes were dedicated to being called up by the President of the HPSC to receive their provisional licenses. At this point, he\u2019s half concerned that this is all a fever dream and he\u2019s about to be rudely awoken through those fall dreams he hates. Instead of that, he is being handed a shiny plastic rectangle by Midoriya that grants him certain abilities the average civilian will never get to enjoy in their life. He handed Hitoshi the first step to his \n\ndream\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt's almost enough to forget that the man is Hitoshi\u2019s age.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAre we,\u201d Uraraka shakily spoke up, half crying from receiving her license and half crying out of relief that she had passed still, \u201cignoring that?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIgnoring what?\u201d Midoriya asked, smiling politely yet still somehow seeming so\u2026 \n\ndangerous\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cUh,\u201d Ashido piped up, \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s referring to you\u2026sir.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh, I guess it is rather surprising, I\u2019m so used to my colleagues already knowing that I forget that most people don\u2019t know what I look like. It\u2019s a little shocking isn\u2019t it, to have a president that\u2019s your age?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMore than a little,\u201d he drawled, satisfied at gaining confirmation on Midoriya\u2019s age, \u201chow did you even-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s for me to know and you to never find out,\u201d Midoriya cut in, eyes dark even as his smile remained polite, \u201cI see we have two left out.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe let the topic change gracefully, still trying to settle his nerves that had spiked after being looked at with \n\nthat \n\nface. Those dead eyes had taken his soul out of his body and gave it an impromptu ice bath in the 9th circle of hell. Forget seeming dangerous, he\u2019s met \n\nserial killers\n\n (stain) who didn\u2019t put him on edge as Midoriya does.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou-\u201d Bakugo began, his face still pale but his hands twitch in the tell-tale signs of anger.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBakugo,\u201d Midoriya\u2019s voice was cold while he said the teens name, only returning to normal when he continued, \u201cand Todoroki. Try not to take this too hard, there will be more chances. After all, you are here early. Take your time to relearn some of the things your judges have pointed out on your evaluation sheets. As for the rest of you, welcome to the next stage in your hero carriers! I look forward to the day when you become pro-heros.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d he heard Jirou pipe in from the back, \u201cthat makes you our boss, doesn\u2019t it?!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt would,\u201d Aizawa said, half his face ducked into his scarf so they couldn\u2019t tell but Hitoshi knew the man was smirking beneath it all, \u201cthe minute you all go pro, Midoriya-san here will be your highest superior, just as he is mine.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBossman here is president after all,\u201d Hawks chimed in, standing slightly behind Midoriya in a way that seemed picture perfect for a movie, \u201cHe\u2019ll be the person who holds your careers in the palms of his hands!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cKeigo,\u201d Midoriya sighed, everyone too stunned at this point to speak any further, \u201cyou\u2019ll scare the poor things.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWere you, or were you not the man who gleefully put together an entire document recording the crimes of people who used to work for the HPSC just so you could read it out loud as the police walked in to arrest them?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat has nothing to do with this,\u201d Midoriya grouched, pouting a bit at the hero.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe \n\nwhat\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSir,\u201d Tsugikuni spoke up, tapping his watch.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAh, It seems I have overstayed my welcome. I have a meeting to attend so I shall see you all at a later date. Nedzu, shall we arrange our next tea session for a week from now?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat sounds lovely.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cPerfect,\u201d Midoriya beamed.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere was no way.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe refuses to acknowledge this.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAs the bus started to take them home, pulling out of its designated parking space to head back onto the road, Katsuki found himself at the front by himself. Everyone was already asleep, having been tired out from the stress and exhaustion from the exam (One that he didn\u2019t even pass-). Words echoing in his head even as he turned the volume up on his headphones. Using music to drown out his thoughts.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cBossman-\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cMidoriya-san-\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cPresident-\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHighest superior-\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201c-makes you our boss, doesn\u2019t it?!\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cFuck,\u201d he whispered, hands gripping the seat hard enough to make them creak under the stress. He couldn\u2019t let off explosions now, everyone was sleeping and Aizawa was anal about that shit for some reason, but his hands were sweaty. Sweaty and twitching spastically as his adrenaline spiked with his emotions.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFuck all of this.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFucking \n\nhow\n\n?!?\n\n\u00a0\n\nHow in the hell was the nerd there? As the goddamn \n\nPresident\n\n?!?\n\n\u00a0\n\nSnatching his phone and opening it to pull up a search page, he immediately went straight for the hero news network. Scrolling through the newest articles until he found the exact one he was looking for.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2018Recently, the Hero Public Safety Commission has released a statement that the prior president has gone into retirement. The mantel was then passed down to the new president, a man named Midoriya Izuku-\u2019\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe scrolled further.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2018BREAKING NEWS: Top board members of the HPSC arrested for several crimes, some of which being embezzlement of funds and discriminatory practices on a wide scale level. President Midoriya was the one who had signed off on the police warrant and had given full permission for the police force to-\u2019\u2019\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFurther\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2018New HPSC structure? What could this mean for the future of heroics? During a gala scheduled by President Midoriya of the HPSC, it was revealed that the HPSC was going to separate into three large categories in order to better compensate for the differences-\u2019\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHow the fuck,\u201d he whispered to himself, hand clenching his phone hard enough that the screen protector gained a small crack, \u201cdid I \n\nmiss \n\nthis?!?!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere was no way, \n\nno fucking way\n\n, that Midoriya Izuku aka: Deku became the President of the HPSC. \n\nHe was the same fucking age as him\n\n, this doesn\u2019t make any sense! There was no place on this mortal plane of existence where that weak fucking nerd would ever get a position as fucking high and powerful as the Presidents seat in the HPSC!\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd yet, the proof was everywhere he looked.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nEvery news article.\n\n\u00a0\n\nEvery segment on the actual news channel itself.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTwitter.\n\n\u00a0\n\nReleased statements from the HPSC.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt was real, and he was so incredibly \n\nfucked\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIngenium: What are your thoughts about the newest president?\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nBestJeanist: Can you even have any thoughts considering we haven\u2019t even seen the man's face yet?\n\n\u00a0\n\nIngenium: Party pooper, I meant based off of the changes he\u2019s made so far.\n\n\u00a0\n\nRyuuku: You guys know you could just ask Hawks, right?

That\u2019s really cryptic? Wha-\n\n\u00a0\n\nThirteen: The president is like the unholy clone of Nedzu but shoved into a tiny body and given a VIP slip into the behind the scenes of Heroic Society, I fear\n\n\u00a0\n\nThirteen: I fear\n\n\u00a0\n\nOrca: T-thirteen?!?!?!?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d Katsuki heard from the stadium chairs, freezing immediately as recognition settled over him, \u201cI see the remedial lessons are going quite smoothly.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAh! Midoriya-sama! I didn't know that you would be stopping by today!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe could feel the vein on his head increasing in size as a familiar mess of emotions bubbled beneath the surface. The strongest one being confusion because what in the FUCK was deku doing here?!? The others being a garbled mess of anger (familiar and calming), disgust, and for \n\nsome-fucking-reason\n\n theres this pit in his stomach that refuses to go away.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI had some extra time on my hands,\u201d thats a fucking lie, Katsuki\u2019s seen the changes been made by the HPSC on various articles, the nerd is probably swamped in paperwork so what the fuck, \u201cso I decided to stop by.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt's an honor sir,\u201d the wet squib of a HPSC bastard said, sparkling eyes turned towards his\u2026 superior.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSuddenly, he felt the weight of someone watching him. Staring at him with the type of intensity he was all too used to. Snapping his head over, he caught sight of Deku watching him, eyes boring menacingly into his head as he sat in the front row. Unusually dark and cold green eyes unsettled him to his core. A smile placed on his lips but in no-fucking-way did it reach his eyes.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWho?\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWhat\n\n?\n\n\u00a0\n\nThat- thats not fucking deku!!!!\n\n\u00a0\n\nDeku doesn\u2019t do shit like unsettling!\n\n\u00a0\n\nThen, as if understanding the trail his thoughts took, Deku\u2019s smile got wider. Ever so slightly, and just enough to be considered a change. The difference was this smile was colder than before, sharper, more dangerous in a way he wasn\u2019t used to seeing.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSuddenly, he recalled all those notebooks Deku would make. The analysis ones. The ones that had way more information than they should have. He had conveniently named the his \u2018stalker\u2019 notebooks because who the fuck knows that kind of shit? He can still remember the first time he had read one about himself and was made uncomfortable aware of how his unconscious food intake decisions affected his quirk levels\n\n\u00a0\n\nFuck.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWell, I should be on my way,\u201d Deku mused, he sounded \n\namused\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOf course, let me show you out.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cU-uh, Midoriya\u2026 sama? Sachou? Mr.President? Man in the chair? Heroic societies dadd-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c\n\nKaminari\n\n,\u201d Iida stressed, his face a remarkable pale that reminded Izuku of those clickbait youtube titles where a ghost spawns on the mortal plane to commit atrocities.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMidoriya-san will do just fine,\u201d he said, saving Iida from the aneurysm that would no doubt happen if Kaminari had been allowed to finish speaking that last version.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cCool,\u201d Kaminari smiled, brushing off Iida\u2019s melt down as easily as the teen breathes, \u201cwhat brings you here, Midoriya-san? Aren\u2019t you like\u2026 busy? Being president?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d he agreed, nodding his head slightly as he smiled over the cup of tea he held just before his lips.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey stared at each other for a moment. The entire common room of the class A\u2019s dorms stilling in their curiosity as they all stared at him. It was kind of amusing how they reminded him of curious little puppies that caught sight of a colorful butterfly flying nearby. How \n\nadorable\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSooooooo are you going to explain?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDo I have any reason to?\u201d He questioned back, taking the sip of tea he had meant to a moment ago.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI- You're kind of terrifying.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThank you!\u201d He beamed, radiating happiness. \u201cI try!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou know what?\u201d He heard piped up from the back of the common room, a look telling him exactly who had just spoken. \u201cI don\u2019t want to know. I refuse. Goodnight.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cShinsou it\u2019s 12pm on a saturday?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d Shinsou stressed, \u201cI should have never been awake to witness this.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMood,\u201d drawled a familiar voice. Well, familiar to him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAs screams erupted within the common room, Izuku sighed to himself. He should really make do on that promise of his to put a bell on a collar for Keigo, especially if he was going to sneak around like a little shit.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n\u201cPresident Midoriya, about this-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cPresident Midoriya! According to the data sets-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMidoriya-san, what will you do about-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMidoriya-sama, I swear that this is-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cPresident-san, will you be-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIzuku?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe room stopped, every single person- some of which were the main drivers behind the entirety of the heroics industry, including Izuku himself- going still at the sound of a confused yet warm voice cutting through the volume of the room. It was feminine and soft, like a mothers, and it drew everyone's attention to the door.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAoki, the president\u2019s secretary, was standing in the entrance of the now open door, arm placed delicately on the upper back of a shorter woman who bore strikingly familiar features and green\u2026\n\n\u00a0\n\nGreen?\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMom?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nMom?\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIzuku, sweetie, I came to drop you off some baked goods from our favorite bakery\u2026 but it seems your busy?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh no not at all,\u201d the president smiled, the evidence to the contrary piled high on his desk in the form of paperwork, \u201cthanks mom, I appreciate it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh stop it,\u201d the woman giggled, walking over with a cute little box of cakes, \u201cI\u2019m your mother, let me spoil you sometimes without you being so sweet.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNever,\u201d Midoriya smiled, a genuine smile that was soft and fond.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWho the fuck was this?\n\n\u00a0\n\nMidoriya-san doesn\u2019t do soft and fond.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAnyways, I have to head out now, Mitsuki and I are going for a girls shopping day.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh that's exciting, I hope you have fun. You haven\u2019t hung out much with Auntie Mitsuki in a while.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI will.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd with that, the green haired woman was gone, taking their sanity with her. Obviously that was the president\u2019s mother. They were just having a hard time combining the images of the cold and ruthlessly efficient president with the soft gooey teenager that was talking to their mom.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOh \n\ngod \n\nthat was right, Midoriya-san was a \n\nteenager\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHow many labor laws have they been breaking?!?!\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIf you have a problem,\u201d Izuku spoke slowly, enunciating his words carefully as he let his eyes bore into the teenager who had confronted him, \u201cthen I suggest you find a way to articulate it. Just spewing whatever comes to mind first is terribly inefficient and overall annoying to deal with.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI,\u201d Monoma Neito stammared, face going redder than a tomato as his brows furrowed in anger, \u201cwhat? Who are you to say that to me?!?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAh, it seems he\u2019s been lacking in the exposure department still. He had forgotten that not everyone was aware of his status. 1-B seems woefully confused about this whole ordeal and 1-A\u2019s terrified expressions are probably not helping.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAll he had wanted to do was terrorize Katsuki a bit and then head up to Nedzu\u2019s office to talk about\u2026 things. Well specifically, a possibly giant domino reaction regarding the person that has been carefully and quietly added to their custody as of three days ago. There was a small, very small, chance of reversing some of the damages and considering the members on staff\u2026\n\n\u00a0\n\nWell, he may act cold and ruthless while as president but the opposite is the truth. He\u2019ll act cold if that\u2019s what it takes to save lives.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWho do I think I am?\u201d He questioned, making a show of furrowing his own brows in confusion.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c\n\nYes\n\n,\u201d Monoma stressed, angry puffed up cheeks looking remarkably like a chipmunks.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cM-Monoma,\u201d Kendo, or at least he believes that's her name, spoke up, \u201cI don\u2019t think this is a good idea-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cShut up! He was looking down on me!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nOh. Oh does he hate people with that mentality. The fucking bullshit revolving around the \u2018looking down on me\u2019 inferiority complexes. The byproduct of a shitty education system that revolves around toxic heroic society culture that's a byproduct of the old HPSC. He had to deal with it for over 8 \n\nfucking \n\nyears before he finally managed to get his hands of the very thing that could change it all, and yet here it is again. Being shoved down his throat.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHuh,\u201d he finally spoke, his voice sounding cold to his own ears, \u201cso you're one of those.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Monoma tried, his own voice going slightly shaky despite the man's unsubtle attempts to sound dangerous.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe type of person to make their problems everyone else's,\u201d Izuku continued, a cold sort of fury settling beneath his skin, \u201cmaking everyone miserable because \u2018if I had to be than so do you\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re doing though,\u201d he cut off, \u201cyou're so terrified of being washed away. Of being forgotten or seen as inferior or weak that you lash out. You fight tooth and nail and scream at others to look but in reality you're doing the same exact thing you feared happening to you. You\u2019re calling others weak, just so you won\u2019t get called weak in return. You call others inferior just so they know you\u2019re not like them. You say they suck because you're terrified of being seen as the same. You isolate yourself because you fear what would happen if you let anyone in.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe needs to stop.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s starting to project and he needs to stop, but\u2026\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut this is no longer about Monoma, or even about Katsuki and all their similarities.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis is about society and his number one pet peeve, and he needs to rant.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo Monoma,\u201d he said, smiling that perfectly polite smile he has perfected over the years, \u201cI do believe I have a say. Afterall, I don\u2019t have my title for nothing.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cTitle?\u201d He heard someone in 1-B say, Monoma having gone frozen still after his rant.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we were \n\ntrying \n\nto warn you about,\u201d Uraraka grumbled, \u201cMidoriya-san here isn\u2019t a UA student.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cEh?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the president,\u201d Ashido helpfully added, several eyes snapping to look at her, \u201cof the \n\nHPSC\n\n.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt seems you had fun down there.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cUgh, Nedzu-chan don\u2019t remind me, I almost killed a child.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMy, my Izuku-chan, it seems that you\u2019ve forgotten that you are also a child.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cEw.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAre you alright,\u201d Izuku took a quick glance at their stance, \u201cIchi?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cClose,\u201d the head of the rescue heroic\u2019 department said, their smile fond and amused, \u201cIt's Kiki.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOne of these days I\u2019ll get it right on the first try, you and ichi are similar but there are some minor differences,\u201d Izuku smiled in return, \u201cbesides that, how's the recording algorithm coming along?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Kiki said, \u201cwe\u2019re close to finishing it, Ichi was just too tired to continue last night.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cUnderstandable, I did tell them to take a break if they needed it,\u201d he nodded, walking alongside Kiki as they headed for the records department, \u201cThey might be the only one who can use your quirk in such an intricate way but they're still a valuable friend. I\u2019m not going to force you all to do anything.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe know,\u201d Kiki smiled, something deep and relieved hidden beneath their fa\u00e7ade, \u201cI\u2019ll take my leave now.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAlright,\u201d he agreed, already heading over to where his objective was benign printed.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMidoriya-san!\u201d The head of the printing department cried, all but launching out of his seat to hurry over. \u201cTo what do we owe the pleasure?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAh, nothing huge don\u2019t worry,\u201d Izuku smiled, \u201cI just heard about someone I know completing their remedial provisional license class and wanted to grab his license to deliver it myself. I was heading over to UA to meet with Nedzu anyway.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOf course, sir,\u201d Soroichi nodded fervently, \u201cright this way.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d Katsuki heard the same hauntingly familiar voice say during his homeroom class, Aizawa stopping mid-sentence at the sound, \u201csorry to interrupt.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt was only because he was sitting close enough that he heard a distressed Aizawa mumble \u2018no, no you\u2019re not\u2019 before speaking up to say, \u201cMidoriya-san.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhy,\u201d he whispered to himself, \u201cwhy the fuck. Why the fucking fuck of fucking fuck does he always do this shit?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nIdly, he knew that Jirou and Shoji had turned to him with matching incredulous expressions, but he just didn\u2019t care anymore. Izuku has been terrorizing him for weeks now, fucking weeks and it\u2019s getting on his nerve-\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2026. Since when did he call him Izuku?\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBakugo, Todoroki,\u201d Izuku said, standing at the front of the room, \u201cor should I say Shouto and Ground Zero?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cEh?\u201d He heard half-n-half say, and it was more shocking to hear emotion in the teens voice than it was to see the rectangular cards in Izuku\u2019s hand.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve officially been granted your provisional licenses,\u201d Izuku smiled, \u201ccongratulations.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d He and Halfie both said at the same time. Staring frozen and fixated at the cards being placed on Aizawa\u2019s podium.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cGood luck,\u201d Izuku said, and with that finishing statement, he left the classroom.\n\n\u00a0\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cCongratulations,\u201d Izuku said once again during his time at UA, this time it was up on a podium and directed towards the masses of UA, \u201cfor making it this far despite the tribulations and suffering you\u2019ve no doubt had to persevere through to get to this point.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt has been 3 long years, three years plagued with enemies and hardship. Struggles and peace. Excitement and anxiety. Three years of the best and worst times of their lives, all to get to this point. To get to where they were finally, \n\nfinally\n\n, getting to work in the profession of their dreams. To finally be proheroes.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been watching, as much as I could, as you\u2019ve changed over the years. Grown as heroes and as people who will serve the public and help. To be the good that some people won\u2019t get otherwise. I am proud, as much as I can be, that you\u2019ve chosen to struggle through the times and reach this point. Proud that you\u2019ve decided to enter into the world of saving lives as Heroes.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nKatsuki stared up at Izuku, his old childhood friend turned brother turned victim turned\u2026 \n\nsomething\n\n. Watching as he spoke and soaking up all the differences he could see. It took awhile, and a ton of therapy that was forcefully mandated at some point due to \u2018outside intervention\u2019 (a fancy way of saying the president and principal fraternized with each other to descend on them like well meaning but manipulative devils), but he\u2019s finally accepted that yes. Izuku was in fact the president and wasn\u2019t actually spiteing his very existence. (Casual spite, however, was expected and delivered post-haste as well as deserved).\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe speech wasn\u2019t long, but it was powerful. The way Izuku worked words around and structured them to best deliver his message was always a skill Katsuki reluctantly admired. He had never been skilled in the way of words. Refusing to cherry pick just so some fuck-up extra didn\u2019t get their feelings hurt. Though he could have used it when it came to the more emotional talks he\u2019s had with Izuku over the last year. After finally getting over himself, he had asked for some time for them to talk.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThat had led to several discoveries, one of which being Izuku could pack a mean punch and was \n\nwell trained\n\n.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOnce the speech was over, class A, freshly graduated, had walked over to gather around Izuku. The man having visited them several times over the years to either terrorize them or Aizawa before heading to see Nedzu. He had become a common sight to see in their common room as well. Finally having shed his president\u2019s mask to show more of the honey sweet personality he was known for having when they were kids when he had gotten comfortable.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIzuku!\u201d They all cheered, smiling and crying and laughing as they all celebrated finally reaching this point. Even Aizawa had cracked a grin, a true smile, instead of his usual smirk.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey talked for a while, discussing future decisions and where they were all planning on going from that point onward. Getting advice from the president himself on how to handle certain interactions with the HPSC and to call him at any time if they needed help. They sat there for hours just talking and existing together for a final time before they were separated by their future paths. They would always come back together, in meet ups and hangouts, but for now they would separate.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt was when they had started to walk away, Katsuki having dragged Eijirou with him as they started to head towards the afterparty, when Izuku spoke up.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cKacchan!\u201d He called, making him instantly snap his head around to stare wide eyed at his old friend. \u201cWelcome to heroics!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe area seemed to dull out and muffle around him, his focus kept directly on Izuku. The same person who had discarded that nickname the minute he had decided Katsuki couldn't be his friend anymore. And yet, and yet there it was again. Rolling off his tongue easily, as if he never stopped using it.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOr should I say,\u201d Izuku smiled, a shit-eating grin, \u201cwelcome to \n\nmy \n\nheroics industry.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nYep\n\n, he smiled, amused despite everything as he let out a sharp bark of laughter, \n\nstill fucked.\n\n"
