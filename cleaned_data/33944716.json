    "text": "Summary: Izuku grins to himself as he looks around the spacious office space and finds himself staring up at the HPSC emblem emblazoned on the wall across from the desk, crossing his arms in that self-satisfied way, his grin turns a tad bit feral. You can be a hero Kacchan, go on, it\u2019s all yours. I get it, I can\u2019t be a hero, it\u2019s just not in the books for me. No. I\u2019ll settle. I\u2019ll be your fucking boss instead.\n\n\u2026\n\nAfter bandaging his burns and other various wounds, Izuku washes his hair carefully under the faucet of the bathtub, puts on his nicest suit, tries to tame his otherwise untamable curls. Finishing his attire with a pair of dark sunglasses, he makes his leave from his otherwise empty apartment, whistling pleasantly as he makes his way to work.\nHe\u2019s got himself a nice job. With a nice office, awesome desk chair, a nice view of the city.\nAt fourteen he\u2019s doing pretty good for himself.\nStepping into the large lobby of the massive building, he smiles at his employees as he walks passed them towards the elevator, humming under his breath as he steps into the first one to open, he presses the button for the level his office is on and folds his hands together behind him as the doors close.\nOh, did he forget to mention that he\u2019s the President of the Hero Public Safety Commission?\n\u2026\nWith heroes flanking him, he steps up to the podium on the stage in the HPSC Headquarters auditorium, he vaguely hears Hawks \u2018he is an adorable little baby bird like how\u2014\u2019 but he pays him no mind. \u201cHello,\u201d he leans into the mic. \u201cAs President of this somewhat fine establishment, my first order of business is making some changes, can those who were and or are a part of the Paragon program stand up please?\u201d He hears the winged hero inhale deeply at the mere mention of the program, some of the other heroes behind him mutter questioningly between each other, Izuku feels predatorial eyes stabbing into him from behind. People stand, men and woman, of all different departments, all working in one heinous program. \u201cGood, thank you, you\u2019re all fired. Get out.\u201d Muttering and denials break out among his gathered employees and he nods. \u201cOh no, I\u2019m being very serious, you know where the exits are, you have ten minutes to exit my building before law enforcement gets involved.\u201d\nMore whispers behind him.\nHe hears the winged hero whisper to himself too softly for him to pick up.\n\u201cAwesome, can those who determine the hero rankings stand up.\u201d Hesitantly more people stand. \u201cGreat, thanks a lot, you\u2019re all fired too. Leave.\u201d Izuku waves as they slowly leave, throwing him nasty looks, some on their phones, undoubtedly with their lawyers. That\u2019s fine, he has more than enough incriminating evidence against every single one of those individuals to win any matter of court cases. \u201cGood, now that we took the garbage out, we can move on. Anyone who puts profit or reputation over actual factual statistics will not have employment within my Commission. We stand with the people and for the people, we work with the heroes we do not lord over them like a puppet master controlling the strings. Anyone who willingly puts innocent lives in danger, whether it be civilian, hero, or villain, will have no place in my Commission.\u201d\nThe greenette holds his hand out and an intern sets a thick file folder on it. \u201cSpeaking of which, starting now, all those with life contracts are hereby released from their contracts.\u201d Izuku turns as he pulls the heavy file in before he can drop it. \u201cHawks, come here for a moment.\u201d Hawks blinks in shock for a moment before stepping forward as was requested, it\u2019s comical, how much the man towers over his boss. \u201cHere.\u201d The hero fumbles to catch the thick file when it\u2019s tossed at him. \u201cYour contract is terminated. Do with it what you want. You want to be a hero then be one of your own accord. You\u2019re a human. I won\u2019t own a human.\u201d\n\u2026\nSometimes Izuku forgets his the President of the organization that oversees the entire hero community, especially when he\u2019s at school, only when he\u2019s at school, facing Kacchan and his lackies periodically through the day.\nLike, when Kacchan burnt his notebook and backpack and shoulder, Claws carved into his arm, and he was shoved into this utility closet some two hours ago. Checking the time on his wrist watch, he heaves a deep sigh, he\u2019s going to be late for work at this rate.\nTugging his burnt backpack closer, he prays mentally that his work phone is still intact, his prayers are answered when he opens the front pouch of his bag and his sleek smart phone is in perfect condition. Opening his contacts, he debates on who to reach out to, they all technically worked for him, so they all should respond.\nHe chooses Eraserhead and Hawks. They\u2019re in the area today. He shoots off the messages and sits back, looking back when his phone dings two confirmations, and waits patiently.\nTen minutes later there\u2019s voices on the other side of the closet door, he pushes himself to his feet, and the lock clicks from the outside before the doors tugged open.\nThe winged hero grins at him for a moment, grin slowly fading as he takes in his appearance. \u201cBoss what happened?\"\n\u201cBoss!?\u201d He flinches and glowers at the voice of his once childhood friend, of course he\u2019d be here, though he doubts his bully would recognize Eraserhead, Hawks was rather recognizable, the wings were a dead giveaway, of course he\u2019d follow. \u201cWhy\u2019re you calling a quirkless Deku boss!\u201d\nIzuku looks down to his backpack as he leans over to grab it, ignoring the stares of the two heroes on him for the moment, and grimaces when he pulls the strap up over his burnt shoulder.\nHawks eyes him contemplatively, exchanges a glance with Eraserhead, and turns to the younger blonde standing behind the janitor they\u2019d called on. \u201cBecause he signs my paycheck.\u201d Gold eyes narrow dangerously. \u201cDid you just call him useless?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what he is!\u201d Bakugo shouts. \u201cI don\u2019t know what bullshit\u2014\u201d\nHe has enough of this conversation, he just wants to leave, go home and tend to his injuries, and just climb in bed. So he steps forward, between the two heroes, knowing they\u2019ll follow after him, and pauses in front of his explosive bully.\nBiting back his nerves, he turns his head, even cool emerald eyes meet burning red. \u201cYou\u2019ll never be a hero, Kacchan, never, trust me, you\u2019ll never get the chance.\u201d\n\u2026\n\u201cSo,\u201d Izuku stares the two men before him down, Hawks standing beside him shifting nervously, he\u2019s been trained to keep appearances collected, but his feathers are fluttering, giving him the indication that the man is nervous. \u201cAmenomori, you were Hawks handler, were you not?\u201d\nA scaled man nods stiffly, glaring daggers at him, that\u2019s fine. He\u2019s dealt with hate from everyone he\u2019s ever known all his life, adding one more, two more people to that list isn\u2019t going to cause him much harm.\nThe greenette turns to the other man, furred, a fellow animalistic quirk user. \u201cBanzai, you were Hawks punisher, were you not?\u201d The man nods just as stiffly, though unlike the other man, he keeps his hatred well hidden. \u201cVery good, what is it you would do to him when he was sent to you to be punished, answer truthfully.\u201d\nBanzai huffs. \u201cWe\u2019d pluck feathers from his wings amongst various other things.\u201d\n\u201cInteresting.\u201d He turns to the other man. \u201cAmenomori, you were the one who sent Hawks to be punished every time he was sent, correct?\u201d\nThe reptilian quirked man scoffs and chooses not to answer his question, instead asking one of his own. \u201cAre you firing me sir, or are you not?\u201d\n\u201cOh, I am.\u201d A scowl falls over the man\u2019s features. \u201cBut first\u2014\u201d A light of unease shines in his once heated eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sending you to Sector H for punishment. For abuse of power and willful endangerment. For allowing someone to be tortured.\u201d Hawks turns to look down at him in shock, but he ignores the winged man, focusing solely on the two men before him. \u201cYou two are cousins, correct, Banzai your mother took in Amenormori when he was just a young boy. Your cousins but think of each other as brothers. Correct?\u201d The feline quirked man nods slightly. \u201cGood. Amenormori, it is excruciatingly painful for Hawks to have his feathers forcibly removed. I think an appropriate punishment for you is to experience the same treatment as you submitted your client to.\u201d Izuku turns to the other man. \u201cBanzai, how many feathers would you pull from Hawks wings?\u201d\nHe swallows thickly. \u201cThree dozen. Sir.\u201d\n\u201cGreat.\u201d The greenette nods firmly. \u201cI want you to pull three dozen scales from Amenomori\u2019s person.\u201d The man opens his mouth to protest but he\u2019s already moved on to the other. \u201cAmenomori, you willingly allowed Hawks talons to be filed down to the point of injury, I want you to file down Banzai\u2019s claws just as low as you\u2019d file Hawks talons. You made him bleed from how low his talons were filed. I will have someone monitoring you at all times. I want you to file Banzai\u2019s claws down to the point that blood is shed. There will be consequences if you don\u2019t.\u201d\nThe scaled man stares, face as white as a ghost. \u201cWhat\u2019s to keep me from walking out?\u201d\n\u201cWell, there\u2019s this.\u201d Izuku smiles pleasantly. \u201cI\u2019m not overlooking your constant endurance retrainings you submitted my hero to under the last President, I am not so easily going to overlook your blatant disregard for the wellbeing and humanity of another being. You had Hawks tortured as young as six years old, on multiple occasions, under the guise of him not being good enough. I could very easily inform those in Tartarus of your actions and just what you submitted a child to and throw you in the water with the sharks.\u201d He taps his fingers over the desk top. \u201cFrom what I can recall, Takami Kettie and Takami Kentaro are in Block J, they\u2019ve still got three months of their sentence left. I could have it arranged that the three of you are locked together in a cell, the cameras turned off, guards ordered away from the area, and have them informed as to what you submitted their son and nephew to. From what I can find, both, especially Kettie, loved Hawks very much, do you wish to see what their punishment for your infractions might be. Need I remind you Takami Kettie once scalped a man for something as simple as stealing a feather from him. They\u2019ve done worse for less. Do you really want to find out what they\u2019d do with the knowledge of what you\u2019ve done to one they love so dearly?\u201d\nHawks makes a small sound beside him, as though in disbelief that this cute little baby bird (his words) could be so vicious and cold hearted, or perhaps in amusement at the mental picture of what the man before them would look like after being locked in a cell with his dad and uncle.\n\u201cYou can have one or the other.\u201d Izuku, President of the HPSC, smiles sickeningly sweet at the man who dared try and find an escape route from his sadistic punishment. \u201cI\u2019ll let you chose.\u201d He turns to the other man. \u201cSame for you Banzai, though, if I were you, I wouldn\u2019t want your crimes to be revealed to the two elder Takami men. You may not walk out of that cell in one piece. If you were to walk out at all.\u201d\n\u2026\n\u201cYour request is denied, All Might.\u201d Izuku takes vindictive glee in this one. \u201cYou are not going to scope out a child to use as a guinea pig for your quirk. I will provide you a list of qualifying individuals and you will chose from there. So no, you will not be teaching at UA unless you have a valid teaching license.\u201d\nThe blonde man before him, sickly looking and fall apart, coughs up blood into a handkerchief. Hawks makes a small noise of disgust behind the boy at the desk. \u201cMight I ask why I wasn\u2019t taken to see the President, that\u2019s who I requested to see.\u201d\n\u201cOh ho ho pal.\u201d The teen presses a hand to his chest. \u201cI am the President. Denied.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not possible.\u201d Small Might has some audacity to be insulting him in his own office. \u201cYou\u2019re a child.\u201d\n\u201cYes. I am.\u201d He nods. \u201cA child who asked you if a quirkless person, like me, could be a hero, like you. What was it you said again?\u201d Izuku taps his chin mockingly. \u201cOh, right, it\u2019s not possible, you just can\u2019t say that one could be a hero without a quirk. You told me to be realistic, be a police officer you said, well, the first question on the application for the academy is what your quirk is. Be a doctor you said, well, I can\u2019t get into those kinds of schools, hell, the only high school around here that accepts quirkless students is UA, so my going to college, especially for the medical field, isn\u2019t even slim to none, it\u2019s just plain old none.\u201d He leans forward against his desk. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to dream, the great All Might said, but you have to be realistic too kid. And then you left me on the rooftop of a building alone. So I decided, you\u2019re right, everyone who ever told me I could never be a hero was right, so I gave up that dream, it\u2019s in the past, no.\u201d The teen shakes his head. \u201cNo no no, see, me being quirkless doesn\u2019t make me ignorant, so I did what I do best, ruined someone\u2019s career, and arranged a peaceful transition of power. So no, I don\u2019t want to be a hero anymore, you have no worries, I want to be their boss now.\u201d Izuku smiles cheerfully. \u201cAnd I am. So, as your boss, I\u2019m saying request denied. If you\u2019re caught on UA grounds your hero license will be revoked and you\u2019ll be arrested for breaking and entering. And, in light of how truly medically disadvantaged you are, I wouldn\u2019t want to find myself in prison.\u201d\n\u2026\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t fair!\u201d The greenette is the first one to break the silence in their staring match, both teen President and hero staring each other down, chest to chest (as chest to chest as they can be) with their hands on their hips. \u201cLet me level the playing field mister pterodactyl.\u201d\nKeigo turns as the teen marches around him, raising an amused eyebrow when he tugs his desk chair back and climbs up to stand on the desk, noticeably, how he stands heads above him. \u201cReally now?\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna play that game?\u201d Opening his wings, he lifts himself off the floor, hovering above the kid\u2019s stance. They go back to staring each other down, President standing on his desk, hero hovering above his head.\nIzuku breaks first and whines in defeat. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll move in.\u201d\nHe crows in victory and closes his wings, tucking them into his back, falling to the floor with a thump. Grabbing the small teen by the waist, he lifts him off his desk and turns, plopping him down on his feet in front of him. \u201cYou make it sound like it\u2019s a bad thing. Am I really that much of a bad guy?\u201d\nThe boy heaves a sigh and flops forward into the man\u2019s arms. \u201cNo. I just don\u2019t wanna have to listen to a mother hen all day.\u201d\n\u201cLe gasp.\u201d Keigo curls his arms around the teen leaning against his front and squeezes him close as his hands slowly travel around to his ribs. \u201cIf anything\u2014\u201d he claws his fingers into the boy\u2019s ribs and smiles when he shrieks with laughter. \u201cI\u2019m a tickle monster. Not a mother hen.\u201d\n\u2026\nNedzu cackles in the teacher\u2019s lounge before beginning the yearly staff meeting before the term was due to begin, eyes skimming over the contents of the letter once more, he cackles again. \u201cLadies and gentlemen we are in for quite a treat this year, truly.\u201d\nAizawa groans and faceplants into the table he\u2019s sitting at as it appears he\u2019s going to have to be the one to ask what\u2019s gotten the Principle so excited. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cFirst and foremost,\u201d the stoat begins as he folds the paper up and slides the letter back into it\u2019s envelope. \u201cQuirkless combat and defense will be added to the curriculum this year and hence forth. Heroes these days rely too heavily on their quirks. One must be able to tactfully and skillfully take down their opponent without reliance on their quirk.\u201d He pauses.\nWhispering breaks out among the others.\nThe dark haired man lifts his head to stare at the mammalian. \u201cQuirkless combat, I\u2019ve been fighting for that class since I started teaching here, why\u2019s it only being approved now.\u201d\n\u201cWhy,\u201d Nedzu chirps happily. \u201cThe President of the HPSC is quirkless.\u201d\n\u201cNo way!\u201d Yamada exclaims, Majima and Kayama nodding along with him, Kan hums in agreement. \u201cHe\u2019s got to have some sort of intelligence quirk! He managed to overthrow the previous President at fourteen! He can\u2019t be quirkless!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll allow it to get passed just this once because I don\u2019t believe you hold any ill intention with that statement.\u201d Nedzu takes a sip from his tea. \u201cBut that line of thinking is incredibly Quirkest Yamada, quirklessness does not equate to intelligence, some of the smartest specimens of mankind were quirkless. Our new President is highly intelligent. His ability to initiate a transfer of power between himself and our dear departed President was done from sheer intelligence. That in and of itself, knowing he does not have any sort of enhancement to aid him, makes this feat even more magnificent.\u201d\nEctoplasm changes the subject before it can derail from there. \u201cWho\u2019s teaching the new class?\u201d\n\u201cAizawa.\u201d The eraser hero\u2019s eyebrows raise. \u201cYou\u2019ve been chosen as the one to teach the hero students quirkless combat considering your entire fighting style is quirkless in nature.\u201d\nKayama bites her lip. \u201cIs that it?\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d The Principle chirps again. \u201cOur heroics teacher this year will be Kamui Woods. That\u2019s not what\u2019s got me so intrigued, our newest student this year will be Midoriya Izuku.\u201d He grins ferally when their faces pale. \u201cPresident of the Hero Public Safety Commission. Hawks will be joining him as his security detail, he\u2019s a very influential and high standing young man, he needs the best of the best to stand as his protector.\u201d\nMijima raises his hand slightly. \u201cWhy not have Endeavor then, he\u2019s second in rank, Hawks is third.\u201d\nNedzu hums cheerfully. \u201cEndeavor is no longer on the Commission\u2019s payroll and any heroic acts he commits will be taken as Vigilantism and treated as such.\u201d\n\u2026\nThe new class falls silent when a boy and Hawks appear in the door way to their classroom, both wearing dark suits and sunglasses, hair tied back fashionably, hands in their pockets, identical (not completely\u2014for obvious reasons) in stance.\nIida bows respectfully. \u201cPresident Midoriya.\u201d\n\u201cHello Iida.\u201d The boy\u2019s head bobs. \u201cI hope Tensei is doing well.\u201d\n\u201cHe is, yes.\u201d The youngest Iida nods. \u201cHe wishes for me to thank you for the sidekick recommendations.\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d The greenette, Midoriya, by assumption from Iida\u2019s greeting, bobs his head again as he surveys the rest of the class. \u201cStudents.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a student too Problem Child.\u201d A fond nickname donned by Eraserhead, well-fitting too considering, and both boy and hero turn to face the man in his eyesore of a sleeping bag. \u201cAre you really wearing the same suit?\u201d\nHawks grins. \u201cFirst impression is key.\u201d\n\u2026\n\u201cNo,\u201d Midoriya takes a sip from his tea cup. \u201cAbsolutely not. The Sports Festival will be postponed this year, if we hold it at all, I understand the necessity for students to perform and gain work studies with heroes in the field, but they are children (he skillfully ignores Keigo\u2019s pointed throat clearing\u2014asshole\u2014he\u2019s so gonna fire him) who just went through a traumatic ordeal. They need time to process and heal.\u201d He takes another sip of tea. \u201cAnd, besides that, the whole idea of the Sports Festival is incredibly ignorant. Not only do you announce the students name and what department they\u2019re in, but you also announce their quirk, which is asinine on multiple levels. Not including the vital information it gives away for those intending to go into underground heroics, it puts all students in danger. Any villain with half a braincell could very well watch the Sports Festival, which is broadcasted nationally for any and all to see, learn of their targets quirk and brainstorm ways to combat them. That would leave the students as sitting ducks waiting to be picked off. I am denying this request.\u201d\n\u201cFledgling,\u201d Keigo takes the initiative when the stoat sends him a glance, everyone in the room knows that the teen listens to the winged hero more so then anyone else, for personal reasons. \u201cI understand your reasonings, we all do, and it\u2019s not fair to them. I agree that they need time to process, manage, and heal. Mandatory sessions should be set up with Hound Dog, setting it mandatory that they attend at least two sessions is a great idea and we support it wholeheartedly.\u201d He smiles gently when the teen turns to look at him, green eyes glowing with knowledge, analytics, and calculations. \u201cBut the students need this. We can postpone the Sports Festival for a certain amount of time, but it\u2019s not fair to them to withhold the opportunities their upperclassman were given. Those in the other departments can enter the hero course through the Sports Festival, it\u2019s not fair to those who\u2019ve been training all this time for the chance only to have it snatched from them due to no fault of their own.\u201d Aizawa nods in agreement, everyone in the room knows he\u2019s been training someone, and the winged hero bows his head slightly. \u201cIs there a compromise we can come up with?\u201d\nThe President of the HPSC sighs as he takes a sip of tea. \u201cOkay. I concede to your point. But I have certain stipulations.\u201d He turns to address Nedzu sitting across from him. \u201cFirst, name\u2019s can be broadcast, but quirk cannot. For privacy\u2019s sake as well as safety. Second, I am limiting those who are able to view the broadcast, the live stream will only play over the hero network, no exceptions, I understand that it will cause disruption with the public, but the safety of the students comes first and foremost. Third, all students, and I mean all students, are required to know at least basic self defense tactics. Fourth, everyone involved in the attack at the USJ must complete their two mandatory sessions with Hound Dog before they can qualify for participating in the Sports Festival. Fifth, the Sports Festival will be held two months from now, to give the students an appropriate amount of time to come to terms with the trauma they experienced and begin to heal from it.\u201d\nNedzu smiles pleasantly. \u201cI agree wholeheartedly Midoriya, indeed I do.\u201d\n\u2026\n\u201cI\u2019m rejecting Bakugo Katsuki transfer.\u201d Izuku announces, standing in front of the stoat\u2019s desk, hands in the pocket of his hoodie, Hawks standing beside him in a matching hoodie in the same exact position. \u201cHe\u2019s too volatile, he hasn\u2019t learned a thing, he\u2019s got a superiority complex a mile high. No, I am not allowing him to transfer into the hero course.\u201d He levels a stare on the mammalian across from him, the only one ballsy to do so, and meets him with a dare to challenge his decision. \u201cAnd if you decide to go around my back and transfer him anyway I\u2019ll cut the schools funding completely.\u201d\nThe hero at his side snorts softly. \u201cBaby birds grumpy this morning.\u201d\nHe glares at the man next to him. \u201cShut up Kei.\u201d\n\u201cExcuse you.\u201d Keigo turns to look at him, eyebrows raised, as though questioning the decision the teen just made. \u201cWhat did you just say to me?\u201d\n\u201cI said shut up.\u201d Izuku glowers at him. \u201cAs in, stop talking, be quiet, silence peasant. Shut up.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, first off, watch the attitude.\u201d The blonde man straightens from his slouched position and turns completely. \u201cI know you\u2019re angry, but you\u2019re not going to disrespect me like that, so mind yourself.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t talk to me like that.\u201d The mini President snaps. \u201cI\u2019m your boss.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m your guardian.\u201d Keigo shoots right back. \u201cThat trumps everything. Drop the attitude.\u201d\n\u201cOr what?\u201d\nThe teen yelps when the mans hand snaps out and snags his ear, pinching as he tugs him around by said ear, the man calls over his shoulder as he makes his way across the Principle\u2019s office. \u201cWe\u2019ll finish this meeting later. I\u2019m gonna go roast his backside.\u201d\n\nIzuku sniffles miserably, head resting on his guardian\u2019s chest, enjoying the feeling of fingers playing with his curls. The body under him shifts and lips brush over his temple. Tears were falling down onto the chest of the person under him, something soft brushes against his other cheek, tears of anger and tears of a child with a sore rump to their name.\u00a0\n\n\nLips brush over his temple. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with my precious little Eyas, this isn\u2019t like him?\u201d\n\n\nThe greenette swipes at his nose miserably. \u201cI got to let him into the Hero course.\u201d\n\n\nKeigo makes a face, of all the things he knew of that Bakugo brat, he had no right to even lay his eyes on the hero course uniform. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBecause of Shinsou Hitoshi. He made it in.\u201d Izuku pets the wing curled around him and it curls in closer. \u201cIf I don\u2019t let Bakugo Katsuki in too that would seem as the the HPSC was showing favoritism, or that we are spiteful, and in this case we are, I am, I want to see the look on his face when he doesn\u2019t get the acceptance letter. But we can\u2019t. Because I made it a point to remain impartial to these things unless an explicit reason is given by a professional as to why he shouldn\u2019t be place\u2013\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, I could give you hundreds.\u201d\n\n\nThe greenette giggles softly and wet. \u201cNo Kei, I mean by one of his teachers, one of his teachers would have to give an impartial reason as to why he wouldn\u2019t be fit for the hero course. None of his teachers have any. They\u2019ve already signed him over.\u201d And promptly sniffles again. \u201cAnd just after I thought I was away from him\u2013\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNow hold up just a minute.\u201d A tan hand raises in his line of sight. \u201cIf you think this feathered father slash bodyguard would let some playground bully at his baby bird slash boss then I\u2019m extremely offended right now.\u201d That tan hand comes in and brushes through his curls. \u201cAnd thats not to say you have to let him into Class 1-A, there\u2019s always Class 1-B, just as nice as the original.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, true.\u201d Izuku tilts his head. \u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d\n\n\n\u2026.\n\n\nThere were times, days, when him and the Principle would enjoy a cup of tea together sitting in a secret back room to the mammilians office, where they sit now, sipping at steaming cups of calming tea and watching class 1-B train out in the field behind the school.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cMy dearest friend,\u201d the stoat begins in the silence. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you manage, dealing with hormonal teenage humans is a trial for myself, how do you manage to run an entire Government organization without, with lack of better term, losing your mind.\u201d\n\n\nThe feather dangling down his chest wiggles slightly, a silent inquiry, and he rubs it in response, he\u2019s okay. But the feeling brings a smile to his features as he takes a sip of tea. \u201cKeigo. I\u2019d be a bumbling mumbling mess without him. He takes good care of me. Sometimes I wonder who\u2019s really running the Commission, myself or him, it\u2019s only when I sign his paycheck that I get that reality check that it is in fact me.\u201d\n\n\nNedzu snorts into his drink softly. \u201cHe still gets paychecks?\u201d\n\n\nThe boy cracks a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s for shits and giggles at this point, he laughs every time he sees the envelope on his desk while having a debit card for the Commission\u2019s personal accounts in his back pocket.\u201d Midoriya takes a small sip as to continue. \u201cHe says he\u2019s putting those away in a college fund for me despite the fact I could easily utilize the courses we already have.\u201d He sighs and rubs his thumb down the shaft of the feather, fingers curled around it tightly, and takes another sip. \u201cThere are days I can\u2019t even get out of bed, my doctor, the best the hero world has to offer, says it\u2019s crippling depression, I won\u2019t bore you with the details.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou are a wonder Midoriya.\u201d The stoat hums into his tea. \u201cSo young but so well achieved, a mystery I have yet to solve.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s simple really.\u201d A somber smile is sent his way. \u201cI played russian roulette with Life and Death.\u201d The small boy takes a sip. \u201cDeath won.\u201d\n\n\n\u2026.\n\n\nIzuku wasn\u2019t lying when he said he relied on Keigo, the man kept his sanity from leaving him, he has no idea after an official full year of running the Hero Public Safety Commission how he hasn\u2019t gone insane yet. Running the HPSC and going to school at the same time and full time no less would run anyone ragged. Perhaps that's what happened to the previous President, she didn\u2019t have her own Keigo to keep her from spiraling down into the darkness too deep.\u00a0\n\n\nBut he has his Keigo.\n\n\nA man who knows him better than he knows himself.\u00a0\n\n\nWho caught him when it all became too much and he started crumbling, caught him in his arms, curled him up in his wings, and hid him away from the world until he deemed it was good again.\u00a0\n\n\nHe relied on Keigo in what was most probably an unhealthy amount.\u00a0\n\n\nNeither one of them will ever speak of the weekend after Izuku suggested reopening the Paragon Program with stricter guidelines for the instructors. Keigo had pulled away from him completely and he never realized how truly broken he was until the moment he didn\u2019t have his glue that kept him together. Izuku\u2019s played russian roulette with life a number of times. Death always won. Keigo had come back ready to talk about these stricter guidelines and how they\u2019d get the children and age requirements, things of that sort, and found him on the roof with a bullet in his head.\n\n\nHe won\u2019t bore you with the details.\u00a0\n\n\nKeigo never pulled away again.\n\n\nIzuku wasn't ever allowed to have a gun again.\n\n\nThe sight of the HPSC doctors pulling the bullet out of his charges head as they revived him will forever haunt the man\u2019s dreams.\u00a0\n\n\n\u2026.\n\n\nKeigo\u2019s not blind.\u00a0\n\n\nLet him explain, he can see the weight of the world settling on his poor chick\u2019s shoulders, carrying the weight of the hero world is weighing him down. He was starting to grow a tad darker, like when he brought up the Paragon Program again, something of which, after he explained himself, he agreed with, especially given the fact that he\u2019d be overseeing the training and such himself, because he knew when something was being taken too far.\u00a0\n\n\nBut he also kept a close eye on his charge, he was a wonderful multitasker, he could keep an eye on both things. He could see the bags growing under the boys eyes as his work started growing later and later into the night, his hair became greasier and greasier as he stopped taking care of himself, it was when he noticed him starting to itch \n\ndown there\n\n consistently that he stepped in.\u00a0\n\n\nFirst things first, he left the Paragon Program to Rumi to watch over as he focused his undivided attention on his fledgling.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d he tugs the boy up from his office chair and around from behind his desk. \u201cWe\u2019re going to the doctors.\u201d\n\n\nIzuku perks up. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBecause,\u201d he winds an arm around his shoulders as he leads him out of his office. \u201cYou have a yeast infection, that\u2019s why you\u2019re so itchy down there, we\u2019ll get you the necessary topical cream for down there, go home and get you a nice long shower, get you a nice filling meal, and we\u2019ll settle down in the nest and watch a few movies until you fall asleep for a nice long night\u2019s sleep.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut why?\u201d The greenette tries to duck out from under the man\u2019s arm but gets nowhere. \u201cI got work to do Kei, I can\u2019t afford to\u2013\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t come with me willingly I\u2019ll turn you over and warm up your behind and drag you to the doctor\u2019s by the ear if need be.\u201d Keigo smiles down at him softly. \u201cYour choice.\u201d\n\n\nIzuku rubs at his bottom just at the thought of a spanking. \u201cI\u2019ll come willingly.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGood choice.\u201d The hero slash bodyguard nods and brushes a kiss over the side of his boy\u2019s head despite the greasiness. \u201cThere\u2019s something I want to talk to you about when we get you settled down nice and comfy in the nest too. And I want you to let me speak without interruption, okay, no interruptions, I\u2019m pulling the guardian card which myself, you, and your little bottom knows trumps all else.\u201d\n\n\nIzuku nods. \u201cOkay Kei.\u201d\n\n\nKeigo joins them in the examination room at his boy\u2019s request, it\u2019s ever endearing his fear of doctors, perhaps a tad concerning as well, what could have happened in his boy\u2019s past that made him so fearful of being alone with a doctor. He\u2019d delve into that at a later time. He was there as the doctor did his examination, and immediately rises when he dismisses his boy. \u201cI don\u2019t fucking think so, perscribe him what he needs or so help me god.\u201d He knows the dismissal was because of his quirkless status.\u00a0\n\n\nFacing the possibility of facing the number two hero\u2019s rage was not something the doctor wanted to experience and therefore prescribed him the topical cream he\u2019d need for his yeast infection.\u00a0\n\n\nThe man cooks them a nice large meal while he listens to the shower run, it takes a while, his little one takes a nice long shower just as he said he would, he specifically said under no circumstances was he to come out of that shower in less than ten minutes, he wanted him nice and pruney when he saw him again.\u00a0\n\n\nThey eat in companionable silence, he watches happily as the boy shoves food in his mouth, clearly starving, his cheeks puffed up like a chipmunk, and when he has his fill, he can\u2019t eat any more, he leans back in his chair with a comfortable smile and rubs his full tummy.\u00a0\n\n\nThen they settle down in the nest, Izuku settled in the crook of his shoulder, a small happy smile spread over his features. His itchiness taken care of for the time being (until it was time to apply his cream again),\u00a0 he was nice and clean and not greasy and sticky, and his tummy nice and full, not to mention cuddled up in his beloved guardian\u2019s embrace.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to bring up what I said I wanted to, okay, remember what I said,\u201d Keigo strokes a finger down the bridge of his boy\u2019s nose, smiling at his content sleepy smile, waiting for him to nod before continuing. \u201cFledgling mine, I\u2019m concerned about you, highly concerned, you\u2019re running yourself ragged. I don\u2019t think you should be acting President anymore, not for a while at least.\u201d He presses a finger to the boy\u2019s lips when he makes to speak. \u201cShhh, no interruptions, remember. I want to take over for you so you can rest and heal, and when I think you\u2019re ready, you can come back to your position, but only when \n\nI\n\n think you\u2019re ready. You can still have your say in decisions that we need to make, but I don\u2019t want you to be making the decisions on your own, you\u2019re starting to head down a dark path and I don\u2019t want you to make a decision you\u2019ll regret for the rest of your life.\u201d He strokes a finger down the bridge of the boy\u2019s nose again. \u201cBecause you\u2019re so young and you don\u2019t deserve that. You deserve to rest and heal, act like a child still, focus on your studies, have fun, hang out with friends you\u2019ve made.\u201d\n\n\nIzuku, though sleepy and content, is paying rapt attention to what\u2019s being said. \u201cKeigo\u2013\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo no chick mine.\u201d The hero shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019m not asking. I\u2019m pulling the guardian card and temporarily removing you from power. You\u2019re breaking yourself my little one and I don\u2019t like it. Rumi can take care of the Paragon Program while I\u2019m doing this for you.\u201d\n\n\nThe greenette smacks his lips. \u201cYou and me?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSure, little one, you and me. Mostly me. But you and me.\u201d Keigo scratches at the back of the boy\u2019s neck because he knows how much he likes it. \u201cI just want you to be okay.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOkay Kei.\u201d Izuku nods slightly against his shoulder. \u201cI trust you.\u201d\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\nIt takes time, but Izuku begins to flourish again, the shine that had left his eyes is there once more, the smile that made everyone\u2019s day had returned, and he was making his way through the halls of the Commission Headquarters like a beacon of light, the same beacon of light that had been there for the first couple months after he had taken charge of everything.\u00a0\n\n\nKeigo was ready to tell his baby bird that he thought he was fit to return to acting President, but he didn\u2019t have the heart to, watching him laugh with his friends and play video games and get back into his journaling. Izuku never asked for it either, he never brought it up, and if he didn\u2019t bring it up then he wasn\u2019t going to bring it up either. So he kept the seat to himself, taking care of things internally while their previous president had a good time being the kid he still was.\u00a0\n\n\nSure, they still got together when it came to the big decisions that had to be made, but Izuku never asked for his seat back and he didn\u2019t want to force it on him, he was more than able to run things on his own (for the most part).\n\n\nSo the Presidency stayed with the winged hero as the usurper hung out at the mall with a group of his friends.\n\n\n\u2026.\n\n\n\u201cBoy oh boy is my fledgling giggly today.\u201d Keigo teases, wiggling his fingers in his charges lower belly lightly, smiling at his contagious wild giggles. \u201cI love it when my fledgling gets all giggly.\u201d He crawls his fingers up the youth\u2019s belly and claws his fingers in the boy\u2019s ribs slightly, laughing softly when the boy squeals and bats at his hands. \u201cI can\u2019t get over how ticklish you are, I\u2019m barely doing anything and you\u2019re already a mess.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cKehehehehehei! Stohohohohohop!\u201d (Kei! Stop!) Izuku shrieks with giggles as fingers knead into his ribs. \u201cPleeheheheheheheease! Ihihihhiihihihit tihihihihihihihickles!\u201d (Please! It tickles!)\n\n\n\u201cCoochie coochie coo.\u201d The greenette squeals with laughter when fingers spider down his sides suddenly, up, and down, and up again, and down once more. He wiggles and rocks from side to side in an attempt to get away from the spidering fingers. \u201cTickle tickle tickle.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEeeieiieaiaahahaahhaahhaahahahahaa Keihehehehheheheheeeiieee! Aaaahahhahhahhahahahahahaaaha eeieiieeiaaahahahahahahahahahhahhaaa stohohohohohop tehehehehehehehheasing meheheheheheehe!\u201d (Kei! Stop teasing me!) He squeals when the fingers come up to spider all around his belly, arching his back into the spidering fingers, and squeals once more when they start spidering all over the place, up and down his sides and all around his belly. \u201cKeheheheheeieieiaahahahahahahahahahahaa nohohohohoohohoohohoohhooo nohohhoohohohot thoohohohohohose! Nohohohohot thehehehhehe eiieiaiiaaahahhahaahhhahahhahaaha spihihihihihihiders!\u201d (No not those! Not the spiders!)\u00a0\n\n\nHe giggles wildly when the hands raise, fingers wiggling slightly, looking between them both with wide eyes. \u201cYou know whats coming your way now?\u201d The hands dip and he shrieks with laughter until their raise again. \u201cGuess what\u2019s coming your way.\u201d The teen squeals when they dip, this time touching his belly, and he arches into them, before they lift again. \u201cThere\u2019s a certain kind of claw that the tickle monster utilizes on his victims.\u201d The hands dip, and he squeals, because Izuku knows what he\u2019s talking about and how bad they are. The hands hover over his belly, and he stares at them with wide horrified eyes, giggling wildly, the fingers stop wiggling and curl inwards. \u201cThe tickle claws.\u201d\n"
