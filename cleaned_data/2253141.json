    "text": "\n(Time: inescapable, inevitable, moving)\n\nThere's a tiny clock on his wrist, bright red numbers. It's supposed to tick, supposed to move, supposed to tell him when he'll meet his soulmate. The time will run to zero when they've met, moving numbers will become stationary\u2014the ticking that signified uncertainty transforming to the silent stability of forever.\nIwaizumi Hajime's clock hasn't ticked for as long as he can remember. For as long as he's looked at it, he has seen only zeroes. Nothing else. The bright red light doesn't bring anticipation to him like it does for everyone else. It's a looming, painful reminder that maybe there's not someone out there for him. Maybe his soulmate is gone, dead, left him there. Maybe he's never had one to begin with.\n\u2026\nThe first time he actually remembers looking down at the timer marring his wrist he\u2019s three, a few weeks away from four. His mother is in the kitchen cooking dinner when he walks in, bare feet pounding on the floor with every step\u2014he never did know how to keep quiet when he was that young.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d He pulls on her shirt, gesturing to his wrist when she turns to look at him, all warm eyes and smiles.\n(She can\u2019t see it, of course. He\u2019s the only one that\u2019s able to see the numbers on his wrist, but everyone knows that there\u2019s a clock on each person\u2019s wrist, so it\u2019s easy to guess what he\u2019s talking about.)\n\u201cIt\u2019s a timer. When it stops ticking and reaches zero it means you\u2019ve found the person you\u2019re supposed to be together forever with.\u201d\nHe remembers staring at the red numbers for a moment and not completely getting it, and murmuring a quiet \u201coh\u201d before running off to get back to the toys he\u2019d left strewn on his bedroom floor. The thought of clocks and numbers and forevers are very far from his mind then.\nIt isn\u2019t until much later that he wonders why his timer is at zero already or why he\u2019s never seen it with any numbers besides zero.\n\u2026\n\u201cIwa-chan!\u201d\nIwaizumi can\u2019t explain the weird combination of annoyance and fondness that overcomes him when the too familiar presence lets go of his mother\u2019s hand and runs toward him, nearly tackling him to the ground. (Even to this day, he still can\u2019t explain it, chalks it up to one of those things that will probably always be a mystery.)\nOikawa Tooru has been his friend for as long as he can remember. So many of his memories\u2014of their memories\u2014involve each other that he can\u2019t really pinpoint a time when they weren't together.\nTheir mothers had apparently been old friends, excited to have children who would be born around the same time, wanted them to be friends. Well, they've gotten their wish\u2014Oikawa and Iwaizumi had always been together, part of each other\u2019s lives, best friends.\n\u201cGet off!\u201d Iwaizumi complains, trying to shake Oikawa off of his arm. The younger boy had jumped on him, clinging onto him and chattering excitedly.\n\u201cAww, you\u2019re mean.\u201d Oikawa\u2019s eyes are filled with mischief. \u201cDid you miss your nap again, Iwa-chan? Is that why you\u2019re always so cranky?\u201d\nHe pinches Oikawa\u2019s arm, and the boy yelps in pain, letting go of him and immediately whining. \u201cMom! Iwa-chan pinched me\u2026 again!\u201d\nOikawa Tooru is a brat. He\u2019s spoiled, likes to tease, thinks he can get away with whatever he wants\u2014he probably can, because as bratty as Oikawa is, he\u2019s that charming kid with a cute face and sweet smile that draws attention and makes people want to indulge him.\nIt\u2019s annoying.\nBut at the same time, it\u2019s something he\u2019s grown used to. And even though Oikawa can be a complete pain, he\u2019s still fun to be around, even when he acts like a total crybaby.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Iwaizumi murmurs, not to Oikawa\u2014never to Oikawa, whose crocodile tears and quivering lip are suddenly gone the moment Iwaizumi says it\u2014but to his mother, who probably doesn\u2019t want her son being hit or pinched. It\u2019s not that he wants to say it, but Iwaizumi\u2019s mother probably would have made him say it anyway, so may as well do it before she\u2019s upset with him.\n\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s fine, Hajime-kun,\u201d Oikawa\u2019s mother assures him. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you two go and play?\u201d\nIwaizumi looks at Oikawa, who is smiling expectantly. (See, annoying.) He grabs the other boy\u2019s hand. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\u201cI get to pick what we play to make up for you pinching me, right Iwa-chan?\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d He has to restrain himself from squeezing Oikawa\u2019s hand too tightly.\n\n(Together: companionship, united, close.) \n\nIt\u2019s probably something they\u2019ll always be.\n\u2026\nThe next time he even thinks about the timer on his wrist is when he\u2019s seven. He\u2019s at Oikawa\u2019s house, the two of them outside, hitting a volleyball back and forth. It\u2019s something they picked up not too long ago after Oikawa had seen it on TV and absolutely insisted that they try it. Turns out, it\u2019s not such a bad idea and they both enjoy it\u2014even joined the volleyball club at their elementary school.\nOriginally, Iwaizumi thought it was going to be a phase that Oikawa went through. In their years together, there have been a lot of phases: Pok\u00e9mon, aliens\u2014that one\u2019s still present, though, no matter how much Oikawa likes to say he\u2019s over it, explorers, bug catching. They\u2019re all things that are the be all end all for a short period of time until, without warning, there\u2019s something new to replace it.\nWhen Oikawa first insists on volleyball, it\u2019s not something Iwaizumi expects to stick. But it does, and he\u2019s glad. They have a lot of fun with it, and it\u2019s worth it.\n\u201cOh!\u201d Oikawa exclaims when they stop to take a break, like he just remembered something really important. \u201cDid you hear about my sister?\u201d\nOikawa\u2019s sister is a lot older than them. In high school, Iwaizumi thinks. \u201cNo, what about her?\u201d\n\u201cShe came home the other day yelling about something,\u201d Oikawa explains. \u201cI thought she got into a fight with one of her friends again, but I guess the timer on her wrist reached zero just as she met some older boy at school.\u201d\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d It\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve ever talked about the timers, about finding a soulmate. He thinks of the zero on his own wrist\u2014red and halted and hanging over his head, a weight ready to crash down on him\u2014and shakes his head. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 cool, I guess.\u201d\n\u201cI asked her about it,\u201d Oikawa says. \u201cShe said that everyone has a timer and that it only reaches zero when you\u2019ve met the person you\u2019re supposed to be with. It\u2019s normal, I guess\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I know. My mom told me before.\u201d He really wonders why the thought of zero is starting to bother him now. It hasn\u2019t before\u2026 maybe because he\u2019s never thought about it.\nThe words slip past his lips without him even thinking about it. \u201cHow much time do you have left?\u201d\nOikawa\u2019s eyes darken for a moment before he looks down at his wrist, biting his lip. Iwaizumi wonders why. It\u2019s not a strange question, is it?\n\u201cA lot,\u201d Oikawa finally answers. \u201cYou?\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t know why the answer bothers him the slightest bit, why it feels unwelcome to his ears. \u201cA lot,\u201d Iwaizumi lies. \u201cThat\u2019s normal, right?\u201d\nZero isn\u2019t normal, but no one needs to know that.\nOikawa nods, a smile back on his face, but it seems kind of strained, forced. Not the usual carefree and annoying-looking grin. Maybe he just doesn\u2019t like talking about it. Forever isn\u2019t something seven year olds typically think about, after all. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go and play again.\u201d\nHe grabs Iwaizumi\u2019s hand and pulls him back toward the yard. Again, Iwaizumi pushes thoughts of their previous conversation away. It\u2019s not something he needs to worry about.\nNot yet.\n\u2026\nBeing older has Oikawa laughing sheepishly as girls run up to him and ask how much time he has left. Every answer is a \u201cSorry, I still have a lot left,\u201d and despite the words, he doesn\u2019t really seem that sorry about it. Iwaizumi\u2019s never seen such simple words break hearts like that. One time, some girl from the year below them even cried. Apparently, she had reached zero when she was in the hall, saw Oikawa and swore that he was her soulmate.\nOikawa had brushed it off with a charming smile and some comforting words before sending her on her way. It still didn\u2019t stop the tears, though. \u00a0\n\u201cBeing so popular is tiring,\u201d Oikawa complains, leaning back in his chair as they\u2019re sitting in class that morning, waiting for their teacher.\nLiar. You love it. Iwaizumi turns around and looks at him. \u201cI don\u2019t know why they would want someone like you.\u201d\nOikawa seems taken aback. \u201cIwa-chan! Why wouldn\u2019t they want me? I\u2019m a very attractive and wonderful person, after all!\u201d\nIwaizumi snorts. \u201cYeah, if only they knew you.\u201d\n\u201cIs that supposed to be an insult?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\n\u201cI think that you\u2019re mean and jealous.\u201d Oikawa sits normally again, leans his head on the desk so they\u2019re looking at each other. His tone is serious, voice low and quiet when he speaks. \u201cI never knew so many people reached zero just like that. I never noticed it before\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYeah, me too.\u201d He hasn\u2019t noticed it before, but it seems like an almost weekly occurrence that someone\u2019s timer will reach zero and they find their soulmate. (That\u2019s probably an over exaggeration, he thinks later. But when you\u2019re surrounded by people finding what you can\u2019t have, perceiving it as never ending isn\u2019t so odd, is it?) \u201cYou still have a lot of time left?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Of course.\u201d\nThey don\u2019t get to say more after that since their teacher walks into the room and begins class.\n\u2026\nIwaizumi isn\u2019t sure when things start to change. Unexpected until he realizes that it really isn\u2019t, unwelcome until he knows it\u2019s a feeling he\u2019d always want to have. They\u2019ve always had a very easygoing relationship\u2014one where things just sort of happen without them even realizing it, where they could easily fall into a steady rhythm that\u2019s all their own. Pitch can change with one little tweak, though, and that's exactly what happened.\nEven then, the tug at his heart\u2014something beyond friendship or fondness\u2014when he sees Oikawa, or the warmth that rises to his cheeks when he thinks of things that could be is an odd, unexplainable feeling.\nPossibilities, maybes and could bes are things he shouldn't think about because there is no hope, no chance of anything remotely like that. None.\nNot when Oikawa\u2019s clock is still ticking while Iwaizumi\u2019s is defunct.\nIt wouldn\u2019t be fair to hold him back\u2026 it\u2019d be selfish. He won\u2019t do that, no matter how much he\u2019d like to. He won\u2019t. \u00a0\nDetached. Apathy. Those are easier. Those would be so much easier to feel. But Oikawa is a magnet. He draws people in, makes them feel something\u2014most of the time without even trying. It is impossible to feel apathetic around Oikawa. Impossible.\nHe's been drawing Iwaizumi in since they were little kids\u2014snotty, sniffling brats who met through their mothers\u2019 mutual friendship. No matter how much Iwaizumi has said over the years that Oikawa is annoying and insufferable and can be the worst to deal with, he never looks away.\nHe never wants to look away.\nI am not falling in love with my best friend, is what he tells himself, but really, he knows it\u2019s far beyond that point. He\u2019s already past the careful, do not cross zone and there\u2019s no going back\u2026 which really sucks.\nThanks Oikawa. Really, thanks.\n\u2026\nI can\u2019t think like that. He\u2019s lying in bed, tossing and turning in the middle of the night. He\u2019s been trying to come to terms with this newfound feeling, still doesn\u2019t completely understand the details that accompany the how and the why, but he\u2019s become a little more adept at putting it into words.\nThe moment he is able to pinpoint is when Oikawa was stressing himself out over getting better, over not getting surpassed, over being able to finally beat Shiratorizawa. Because it hurt to watch Oikawa rip himself apart like that. It was painful to watch Oikawa feel so inadequate and willing to break himself, leaves an unsettled feeling in Iwaizumi\u2019s stomach, an ache in his heart. He never wants to let it reach that point again\u2014where Oikawa very nearly does break himself and snap in two, while nothing Iwaizumi says gets through to him.\nBut it\u2019s not like that now. Finally, his words reached Oikawa, finally everything settled. There\u2019s no more of letting his heart break as he witnesses Oikawa sink deeper and deeper into dark and murky depths where there is no reaching him.\n(Iwaizumi will always fight to reach Oikawa, though. He won\u2019t ever willingly let Oikawa\u2014someone he loves\u2014drown in his insecurities and doubts, won\u2019t give up until he\u2019s able to grab his hand, to reach him, to pull him out.)\n\nLove. \n\nHe still wants to laugh at the word. Just double over and laugh to the point where people would probably dub him insane.\nIt\u2019s just so ironic though\u2014falling in love with someone you can\u2019t have.\nWith a soft sigh, he rolls over in the bed, eyes falling on the person who has caused all of this.\nOikawa had asked to come over after the incident where he\u2019d nearly snapped and hit Kageyama earlier, when Iwaizumi had stopped him and finally made him see reason. Iwaizumi had agreed, partly because he still felt a little bad about head butting Oikawa that hard.\nOkay, maybe not. He probably would have agreed anyway. Really, he\u2019s just happy to see a change in Oikawa\u2019s demeanor after that.\nThey had argued for a few minutes about sleeping arrangements\u2014Oikawa insisting they share the bed because \u201cMy body is too tired and sore for the floor. You don\u2019t want me to get hurt, do you, Iwa-chan?\u201d while Iwaizumi is reluctant. In the end, Oikawa wins. He almost always does.\nOikawa\u2019s face is smashed against the pillow, his limbs sprawled out everywhere, his mouth open and drool all over the pillow. He\u2019s truly an ugly sleeper. Anyone who says Oikawa is beautiful has never seen him like this.\nHe\u2019s not. Beautiful, he means. Well, he is. It\u2019s hard to explain. Oikawa stands out, draws attention\u2014for his looks, personality, skills\u2014but a lot of people don\u2019t know the real Oikawa.\nNot like Iwaizumi does.\nAnd honestly, he\u2019d say that seeing Oikawa real and genuine\u2014with a smile that\u2019s warm and inherently happy, one that lights up his whole face, not fake and put on, exaggerated and a perfect calculation\u2014is something that is beautiful. It\u2019s beauty that\u2019s not superficial like the girls who follow Oikawa around at school see. Instead, it\u2019s something innate, something that only those Oikawa allows to see into his heart will know. Because despite his flaws and imperfections, Oikawa is beautiful. That\u2019s what makes him beautiful, real.\nFuck. \u00a0\n\u2026\nAfter a match, another loss against Shiratorizawa, is when things really do change. It\u2019s the last match of their second year of high school, which means they have one more year, one more shot. They have to do it.\nComfort after losses is either hit or miss with Oikawa\u2014he either accepts it full force or wants to pull away from everyone to be completely isolated.\nToday is the former.\nThey haven\u2019t actually talked much\u2014they don\u2019t really have to because sometimes just being there is enough. Iwaizumi\u2019s just glad that Oikawa isn\u2019t pulling away and shutting him out.\nThey\u2019re in Oikawa\u2019s living room on the couch, both leaning against an arm of it, facing each other, toes touching. It\u2019s dark outside, Oikawa\u2019s parents are out, leaving the two of them alone. Not a word needs to be said for them to simply understand that it\u2019s a night Iwaizumi will be staying over. \u00a0\n\u201cI just want to win once,\u201d Oikawa finally says, breaking the silence between them.\n\u201cI know,\u201d Iwaizumi says. \u201cWe will. Next year, we\u2019re going to win.\u201d\nOikawa nods slowly, accepting his promise. With a soft sigh, he moves forward, pushing Iwaizumi\u2019s drawn up legs out of the way and flopping onto his stomach.\n\u201cHey! What\u2019re you doing?\u201d He\u2019s not expecting it, and they\u2019re a tangled mess of limbs, a clash of elbows and knees.\n\u201cGetting comfy,\u201d Oikawa answers as if it\u2019s the most obvious thing in the world, as if lying all over your best friend is completely normal.\nIt\u2019s not comfortable, but when Oikawa adjusts his position so he\u2019s lying more on Iwaizumi\u2019s chest instead of his stomach and they\u2019re looking at each other, he realizes it\u2019s not that bad.\n(Minus the warmth rising to his cheeks at Oikawa\u2019s closeness. That\u2019s kind of bad, and something he\u2019d rather not be teased for at the moment.)\nBut Oikawa surprises him and doesn\u2019t say anything remotely resembling teasing. He\u2019s completely serious instead. \u201cIwa-chan, thank you.\u201d\nThat\u2019s even more surprising. \u201cWhat for?\u201d\n\u201cYou were amazing today. We wouldn\u2019t have gotten that close to winning if it wasn\u2019t for you.\u201d\nHe\u2019s taken aback by the sudden praise. \u201cUh\u2026 you\u2019re welcome\u2026\u201d\nOikawa continues, not done with his thought. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that I couldn\u2019t pull it out for us\u2026 I\u2019ll work harder next time and\u2014\u201d\nThere it is. Self-deprecating tone and all. It reminds him of third year of junior high when things had been at their worst. Iwaizumi frowns and flicks Oikawa in the forehead, stopping the rest of the words before they can come out\u2014as if that will stop Oikawa from thinking about them. \u201cYou really piss me off when you say stuff like that.\u201d\n\u201cSorry\u2026\u201d\n\u201cQuit apologizing, idiot. You\u2019ve got nothing to be sorry for. You\u2019re amazing\u2026 just like always.\u201d\nOikawa looks genuinely surprised by the praise, his eyes wider than they had been the moment before. \u201cYou think so?\u201d\nOf course I do. \u201cYeah. And one day it\u2019s gonna work out, so quit worrying and saying you\u2019re not good enough. Because you are. You are good enough.\u201d You always are. \u00a0\u00a0\nOikawa looks like he\u2019s contemplating the words, but finally nods slowly. \u201cOkay\u2026\u201d He rests his cheek against Iwaizumi\u2019s chest, tangles his fingers in the front of his shirt. \u201cIwa-chan, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re always here. I\u2019m glad that I can always rely on you. Thank you. Thank you for being there. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do\u2014\u201d\nHis heart pounds at the words, chest tightens. He has always known Oikawa felt this way, but to hear it\u2026 to hear it means a lot\u2014lets him know that Oikawa cherishes his presence as much as Iwaizumi cherishes his. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to thank me, dumbass. I want to be here. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d\nOikawa smiles\u2014really smiles for the first time all night\u2014and hugs him tightly. Iwaizumi\u2019s hand may or may not wander to Oikawa\u2019s hair, resting there, fingers twining in soft curls.\n(It\u2019s not his fault if it does. It\u2019s completely involuntary.)\nThey stay like that for a few moments, are only able to hear their own breaths over the silence of the dark room. Things are comfortable between them, steady. Oikawa has seemingly gotten over the loss. Everything is okay for now.\n\u201cYou wanna watch a movie?\u201d Iwaizumi asks after a moment, pointing to the remote on the floor next to the couch.\nOikawa snatches it up quickly. \u201cOnly if I pick.\u201d\n\u201cYou picked last time!\u201d\n\u201cMy house, my rules.\u201d\n\u201cYou picked at my house last time!\u201d\nOikawa ignores him and flips on the TV, immediately surfing through channels for something to watch.\nIwaizumi grabs the remote from his hands. \u201cGuests should pick. Have some manners.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not a guest, Iwa-chan,\u201d Oikawa singsongs. \u201cWe practically live at each other\u2019s houses. Being guests went away a long time ago.\u201d He pulls the remote back and holds it out of Iwaizumi\u2019s reach.\n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna pick one of those horrible cheaply made action movies. Probably about aliens like usual. Or one of those stupid romance movies.\u201d\n\u201cThose aren\u2019t that bad if you actually try them!\u201d Oikawa slaps Iwaizumi\u2019s hand away just as it comes close to getting the remote and moves it out of reach again. He smirks, knowing he has the advantage because he\u2019s still lying on top of Iwaizumi, who has to struggle to reach him. \u201cAnd besides, you have horrible taste! If it was up to you, I\u2019d have to suffer through some horribly gruesome horror movie!\u201d\n\u201cThose aren\u2019t that bad,\u201d Iwaizumi insists. \u201cYou\u2019re just a big crybaby like you\u2019ve always been.\u201d\nOikawa\u2019s mouth drops open, he looks incredulous. \u201cCrybaby? I am not a crybaby, Iwa-chan! Maybe the only reason I ever cried was because you would pinch and hit me. You\u2019ve always had a horrible temper.\u201d\nIwaizumi finally wrestles the remote away from Oikawa\u2019s hands, but drops it on the floor immediately after because Oikawa starts tickling him.\n\u201cDammit! You idiot! Stop that!\u201d he chokes out between laughs.\nOikawa is smiling triumphantly. \u201cDid you think I\u2019d forget how ticklish you are, Iwa-chan? I\u2019ve got this to hold over your head for all eternity!\u201d\n\u201cDumbass! Stop it!\u201d\nOikawa laughs too, leaning in even closer. \u201cNot until you say I win.\u201d\n\u201cLike hell I will!\u201d\nIt stops so suddenly, he doesn\u2019t notice it for a moment. Oikawa freezes, the laughter dies down, and they\u2019re just staring at each other. Their faces are so close. So very close. Only a breath away.\nSuddenly, Iwaizumi is uncomfortable, is sure his face is bright red upon noticing their proximity. But Oikawa\u2019s is a little red too, and it\u2019s strange. It\u2019s\u2014\nOikawa leans down and kisses him. It\u2019s tentative, unsure, but it\u2019s nice. It\u2019s so nice and feels right. So he kisses back\u2014without even thinking, honestly. It\u2019s just a natural reaction.\nThey break apart, and look into each other\u2019s eyes. That\u2019s when Iwaizumi remembers. Timers. Soulmates. Being like this with Oikawa isn\u2019t supposed to be right.\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have done that,\u201d he whispers, looking away from Oikawa\u2019s face, from his swollen lips.\nOikawa touches his face gently, turning it back toward him so their eyes are locked once again. \u201cI wanted to. But I won\u2019t do it again if you don\u2019t\u2026\u201d\nIt\u2019s probably a bad idea. A very, very bad idea. But he can\u2019t help that all of the pent up feelings built up and ready to explode choose right now to completely rush forward and eliminate any rational thought he may have. And he wants to be selfish. For once, he wants to.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid. I want to.\u201d\nTheir lips meet in another kiss, one that feels like forever even though it really isn\u2019t.\n\u2026\nIt\u2019s so easy after that. At least, that\u2019s what he wants to think. They\u2019re still best friends, attached to each other from years of being by each other\u2019s sides. But it\u2019s nice\u2014a little unbelievable, but still nice\u2014to touch, to kiss, to exist as more than just that.\nFor short periods of time, he\u2019ll forget the ever present reminder that he doesn\u2019t belong with Oikawa, ignore the doubts brought on by the zero on his wrist. But those thoughts can never stay away for long. Because ultimately, when Oikawa\u2019s timer runs out there won\u2019t be any more of this.\n(Of course, they\u2019ll still always be friends. No matter what happens, he can\u2019t imagine walking away from someone who has been such an important part of his life. But still, the reminder of what was and what could have been will always hurt even if he comes to terms with letting go.)\nOikawa won\u2019t tell him exactly how much time is left, only that there\u2019s a lot. And when he asks, Iwaizumi lies and tells him the same. It seems promising. It seems like it could work. But there are so many odds stacked against a random relationship like theirs\u2014one outside of the entity of soulmates.\nEveryone says you\u2019re drawn to your soulmate, that you\u2019ll find them no matter what and any previous threads of relationships past are cut. Denying the inevitable is stupid, especially when there exists something as powerful as a soulmate\u2014someone who can shatter your whole world and rebuild it all anew in just one instant.\n(Iwaizumi knows he stands no chance against that.)\nIt\u2019s like a stab to the heart thinking that one day Oikawa will meet the person who completes him while Iwaizumi will be left behind\u2014alone and forever incomplete.\nStill, it doesn\u2019t stop them, doesn\u2019t pull them apart.\nIt doesn\u2019t stop Oikawa from whispering a quiet \u201cI love you\u201d against Iwaizumi\u2019s chest one night.\nIt\u2019d hurt so much less if you didn\u2019t, Iwaizumi thinks. But it doesn\u2019t stop him from curling his arm around Oikawa\u2019s waist and drawing him in closer. It doesn\u2019t stop him from enjoying the warmth radiating from Oikawa\u2019s skin and pressing a soft kiss to his forehead. It doesn\u2019t stop him from murmuring an \u201cI love you too.\u201d\n\u2026\nIt takes everything he has to stop himself from turning around. Class is really boring that day, drags on. The teacher and a student\u2014a particularly outspoken girl\u2014somehow got into a conversation about soulmates. Of course. \u00a0\nNo one is paying attention to the discussion at the front of the class, or if they are, it\u2019s only vaguely so. There are kids hiding other work behind their books, on their phones, sleeping. Oikawa is another story, though.\nWhich brings Iwaizumi to his current dilemma. Oikawa\u2019s seat is behind his, and he\u2019s been subtly kicking Iwaizumi\u2019s chair for the past five minutes, trying to get him to turn around.\nHe wants to turn around, but only to throw his English book in Oikawa\u2019s stupid face. Too bad he can\u2019t do that, though. The chance of getting caught is too high.\n(There have been enough times where he\u2019s gotten called out on in class for reacting to something Oikawa did. He does not need another instance of that, thank you very much.)\nHe\u2019s half paying attention to the conversation going on, vaguely listening to the words as he tries to ignore Oikawa\u2019s foot on the back of his chair every few minutes.\n\u201cFinding your soulmate prevents divorce, makes relationships more stable. There\u2019s less domestic violence. Things are better this way and everyone should at least acknowledge that.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but no one wants to wait around for someone if they have a lot of time left,\u201d the girl argues. \u201cWe should be allowed to have our fun while we wait.\u201d\nIwaizumi looks up from what he\u2019s drawing in his notebook when a piece of paper lands on his desk. A note. Really? Are they back in junior high?\nStill, he opens it and immediately recognizes Oikawa\u2019s handwriting. I think we should break up. This conversation has made me see the light.\nIwaizumi wants to laugh, doesn\u2019t because of class going on, but scribbles an equally sarcastic note back. Who says you can break up with me? I\u2019ll be the one breaking up with you. And he subtly throws it back to Oikawa\u2019s desk when no one is looking.\nOikawa\u2019s laughter is muffled behind his hand, but still noticeable. That, and he kicks Iwaizumi\u2019s chair again. Idiot.\nIt\u2019s kind of ironic that they\u2019re even joking about this, isn\u2019t it? Neither wants it to get to that point, but here they are writing stupid notes and acting like it will all be okay when they do get there.\nHe reads Oikawa\u2019s response, hastily thrown onto his desk and is torn between smiling and rolling his eyes. As if, Iwa-chan. There\u2019s no way you\u2019d be able to break up with this beautiful face. I don\u2019t care about whether there\u2019s some stupid soulmate there or not. \nThey both must have looked like they were not paying attention because next thing he knows the teacher is calling on them. \u201cOikawa-kun, Iwaizumi-kun, is there something funny about this?\u201d\nIwaizumi freezes, unsure of what to say, but Oikawa is quick to recover. \u201cI actually was wondering why we put so much faith in the idea of soulmates. Who\u2019s to say that I can\u2019t find someone that I love just as much, if not more, on my own? Isn\u2019t that what loving someone should be about? Not finding your perfect match in one chance instant, but finding someone you\u2019ve grown to love on your own.\u201d\nDamn. Iwaizumi wants to bury his face in his hands and never look up again, but since everyone\u2019s eyes are on them, he remains calm. At least he thinks he does.\nA bunch of the girls in class sigh at Oikawa\u2019s words, as if they think this gives them a chance with him.\nThe teacher seems surprised by the words, taken aback by Oikawa\u2019s smile. \u201cWell, regardless of the issue, let\u2019s get back to work. Open your books to page\u2026\u201d\nOikawa kicks the back of his seat again when they teacher isn\u2019t looking. This time, Iwaizumi turns around and sees him smiling. He smiles back.\nEven if this is what they both want, what they both feel, there\u2019s no guarantee that years from now it will be the same. And that just makes everything more difficult.\n\u2026\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe in soulmates,\u201d Oikawa declares. It\u2019s late one night, and they\u2019re doing homework together in Oikawa\u2019s room\u2014the brunet sprawled across Iwaizumi\u2019s stomach and reading his textbook while Iwaizumi leans against the pillows of the bed, using Oikawa\u2019s back as a pad to do math homework. It\u2019s not the most practical method, but it\u2019s good enough for them. The closeness is nice.\nIwaizumi sets his pencil down, trails his hand over Oikawa\u2019s back, gentle. \u201cYou say that now, but you\u2019ll change your mind when you meet yours.\u201d He leans back against the pillows and rubs his forehead, hoping that the lump in his throat won\u2019t prevent him from saying more.\nOikawa turns to look at him. \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t even have one?\u201d\nIwaizumi wants to laugh. \u201cDon\u2019t be stupid. Of course you have one. Everyone has one.\u201d\n\nExcept for me, but you don\u2019t need to know that. \n\n\u201cWell then, what if I don\u2019t want to meet mine?\u201d His voice is petulant, has the slight whiny lilt to it that Iwaizumi knows so well from years together. It\u2019s Oikawa\u2019s defiant tone, the one where he declares he\u2019s not doing something and does not back down.\nThe difference now, though, is that he doesn\u2019t know what to say. He\u2019s become so accustomed to dealing with that side of Oikawa that he usually knows exactly how to respond. But now\u2026 now, he doesn\u2019t.\n\u201cIwa-chan?\u201d Oikawa sits up, turns to face him. All thoughts of homework are forgotten.\nThen you could be mine, he wants to say. If I didn\u2019t know any better, I\u2019d say you were. \nBut he doesn\u2019t say that. Instead says, \u201cYou\u2019ll want to. Even if you say now that you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d\n\u201cBecause everyone says you can\u2019t resist getting drawn in by your soulmate when you meet. You\u2019ll forget all about this when that happens.\u201d\nOikawa frowns, brows furrowed as he thinks about Iwaizumi\u2019s words. \u201cYou don\u2019t know that.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe I don\u2019t, but it seems more likely than not.\u201d Iwaizumi looks down at his lap, away from Oikawa\u2019s face as he says his next words. \u201cLet\u2019s just enjoy this while it lasts, okay?\u201d\nIt\u2019s silent, and for a moment he thinks Oikawa is going to refuse, but then he hears a soft \u201cOkay.\u201d\nHe looks up, realizing that Oikawa doesn\u2019t seem pleased with his words, doesn\u2019t seem satisfied. For a quick moment, Oikawa\u2019s eyes are dark\u2014filled with sadness, fear, and a bit of anger. But as quickly as it\u2019s there, it\u2019s gone, almost like Iwaizumi imagined it. \u201cTooru?\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t forget you,\u201d Oikawa mumbles. \u201cI could never forget you, Hajime.\u201d\nHis heart constricts at that, torn between happiness and sadness. Happiness because this\u2014whatever this is\u2014is real, true, will leave a mark on both of them\u2026 something almost like forever. But there\u2019s sadness because it isn\u2019t, and this will break someday. All good things come to an end. Realities can\u2019t touch dreams. Even unbreakable things can be shattered when an even stronger force sweeps in.\nNothing lasts forever. Not them, anyway.\nEventually, all they\u2019ll have left are memories, and who knows if those will even be something they look back on? Years later their memories from right now could be useless, could be collecting dust, a photo album stored away in the darkest corners of an attic\u2014never even looked at anymore.\nHe doesn\u2019t want that. Not at all.\nOikawa leans forward, resting his hand on Iwaizumi\u2019s arm. \u201cDon\u2019t forget me, okay? Please don\u2019t\u2014\u201d\nI could never. Would never. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I could.\u201d\nEven though it\u2019s a promise forged through their shared determination, desire, punctuated with a sure touch, it doesn\u2019t feel like one. Promises should be built on stability, aren\u2019t supposed to break.\nThis one could. Would.\nBecause all things break in the end. Deteriorate. No longer exist.\nBut he hopes that\u2019s not all they\u2019ll amount to. He hopes with all of his heart that they can beat all of the odds even if that\u2019s something more akin to a dream than a reality. \u00a0\u00a0\n\u2026\nIf it\u2019s possible, Oikawa pulls him in even closer, kisses him soft and slow. Their breath mingles together. They\u2019re so close, no part of them left untouched. Everything is familiar. \u00a0\nWhen they're together like this, it feels like they belong. With hushed whispers, and soft gasps, with sure, steady, and gentle fingers, loving presses of lips against skin, they move\u2014in sync, together, a slow burning with every touch, the thudding of their beating hearts.\n\nAlive. Together. Meant for each other.\n\n\u00a0\u201cHajime,\u201d Oikawa breathes out, blunt nails digging into Iwaizumi's skin, leaving marks that prove he belongs there.\n\u201cTooru. I\u2014\u201d Oikawa's lips are on his, then. Kissing him hard, searing, wanting.\nSomething has never felt so perfect, so right.\n\u2026\nIwaizumi is tired, about to fall asleep when he feels Oikawa shift against his chest and lean closer to whisper softly in his ear. \u201cDo you regret it?\u201d\nIt\u2019s obvious that Oikawa is talking about more than sex.\n\nDo you regret loving me? \n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d Iwaizumi answers honestly, his fingers tracing soft circles on Oikawa\u2019s back as he holds him close\u2014as if he could draw a world for just them, where this would be okay, where it would be forever. \u201cDo you?\u201d\n\u201cNot at all.\u201d Oikawa kisses his chest, right over his heart. \u201cDo you think you\u2019ll ever regret it?\u201d\nEven though there\u2019s a chance of this, of them, ending and that will hurt, when he thinks back on the year they\u2019ve spent together like this he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019d be able to regret it. Experiencing this has been worth it. Forever or not.\n\u201cLike hell I could.\" And he draws Oikawa in closer, kisses him again.\n\u2026\nIt\u2019s late fall when he realizes everything is coming to an end. High school, volleyball, them. Everything is drawing to a close. All they know will end with different universities and no more volleyball. Being together is no longer a guarantee. It\u2019s still a choice that they will prioritize, that they will hold above any other option, but there is no guarantee it could be that way. There\u2019s never a guarantee. \u00a0\n\nEverything ends eventually. \n\nOikawa had called him\u2014at almost midnight, no less\u2014and asked him to come over. He gave Iwaizumi no explanation, no reason. Just asked. It wasn\u2019t like the usual demand for him to come over\u2014the annoying, almost whiny, and expectant pleas when Iwaizumi would initially say no.\n(And yes, he would say no to a stupid request at midnight after a long day at school and practice when all he wants to do is sleep.)\nNo, this was different. It was just a simple request\u2014not all dramatic and drawn out. Plain, simple, a \u201cCan you please come over?\u201d\u00a0There\u2019s even a please. He wants to laugh at that. It\u2019s so vastly different than the usual \u201cIwa-chan, come over, I\u2019m bored!\u201d\nFive minutes is all it took for him to pull on a sweatshirt and quietly sneak out of his own house, walking the short distance to the one across the street that\u2019s basically become his second home over all of these years.\nIt isn\u2019t until he gets there that he thinks about getting in. After years of this, he knows how to get into Oikawa\u2019s house\u2014knows exactly which first floor window will open if you jostle it the right way, knows which stairs to be extra careful on because they creak loudly when stepped on the wrong way. It\u2019s become an art, of sorts. A perfectly mastered skill.\nBreaking into Oikawa\u2019s house without his parents\u2019 knowledge\u2026 what a skill to have. That one will be really useful in real world application.\nIt always feels a little awkward doing so without his parents\u2019 knowledge. It feels wrong. Almost. Hasn\u2019t stopped either of them for all of these years, though.\nHe\u2019s about to head back toward the window that he always uses when a voice stops him. \u201cThey\u2019re not home. The door\u2019s open.\u201d\nIwaizumi looks up to where the voice had come from, sees Oikawa sitting on the roof, knees drawn to his chest, chin resting on them.\n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing up there, dumbass? It\u2019s cold out! You\u2019re gonna get sick and we have a tournament next weekend! I swear if you\u2014\u201d\nOikawa grins at him. \u201cYou know, I could have sworn that my mom was gone for the weekend\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou wanna repeat that?\u201d\nOikawa laughs. \u201cNo, no. Sorry, Iwa-chan.\u201d He\u2019s all smiles and it is seriously too late for this. \u201cYou wanna come up?\u201d\nAs if he has a choice. \u201cFine, but only for a few minutes. Then we\u2019ll go inside.\u201d It\u2019s cold, and obvious it will be winter soon. A night out on the roof in the cold air pales in comparison to sleep in a warm bed.\nThis is something he\u2019s familiar with too. They\u2019ve spent countless times up there. When they were kids, going on the roof was a taboo. There was a constant warning that they would fall and get hurt. But one day Oikawa had determined that ten was old enough to climb up there on their own. Their parents didn\u2019t have to know about it if they snuck it in the middle of the night. So they had. Nothing bad happened, fortunately. If anything, the routine stuck and now it\u2019s a place they can go, a place where they don\u2019t have to talk in hushed whispers or fear waking their parents up. No, this is a place all their own.\nBy now, they\u2019re both experts at climbing up there, don\u2019t need any help from each other like they had when they were kids. Still, he takes Oikawa\u2019s outstretched hand and lets him help pull him up.\u00a0\nHe sits down, their shoulders brushing, Oikawa\u2019s hand never leaving his own. \u201cWhat\u2019s up for you to call and ask me over this late?\u201d\n\u201cOh, so I have to have a reason now, Iwa-chan? I can\u2019t just ask you over because I want to?\u201d\n\u201cIdiot,\u201d he murmurs softly, nudging Oikawa\u2019s shoulder with his own. \u201cOf course you can. It seemed like more than that though.\u201d\n\u201cMy parents are gone for the weekend. They went to visit my aunt and uncle and I hate being home alone.\u201d\nIwaizumi knows that\u2019s true. Back in junior high Oikawa\u2019s parents had left him home alone to go to some friend\u2019s wedding under the impression that Oikawa would be fine on his own for a few days. (Really, there was no reason for them to think otherwise, especially with Oikawa\u2019s loud assurances that he would be fine alone.)\nNot even a day had passed and he was spending the rest of his parents\u2019 trip at Iwaizumi\u2019s house because he didn\u2019t like being alone in the house at all.\n\u201cYou still scared of the dark?\u201d\nOikawa pouts at the jab. \u201cAm not. Shut up.\u201d\n\u201cThen it\u2019s that you think someone\u2019s going to break in.\u201d\n\u201cI do not! I just don\u2019t like being by myself.\u201d Alone. Lonely.\nHe quits with the teasing, squeezes Oikawa\u2019s hand tighter. \u201cYou should have said something earlier.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mind, then?\u201d\nAnother gentle nudge of his shoulder.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m here, aren\u2019t I?\u201d\nA smile, a nudge back. \u201cYeah\u2026 you are. You always are.\u201d\nIt\u2019s something that doesn\u2019t need to be answered with words, can instead be conveyed with a reassuring squeeze of his hand. I want to be. \nThey\u2019re quiet after that, just look at each other, enjoying the moment between them. They might not have many more left, so cherishing every single one is important.\nOikawa is bright, radiant against the dark night sky, fits in perfectly. A bright star that won\u2019t stop shining, that won\u2019t go out even when clouds try to cover him.\n(Each look they share, each breath, Iwaizumi falls more and more in love with him.)\nOikawa\u2019s hand is warm in his own, a soft and gentle touch\u2014one that he doesn\u2019t want to end. But it\u2019s a touch that could break, shatter at any moment.\nTime ticks on slowly, will continue to tick until their time runs out. It\u2019s inevitable. It will happen.\n\u00a0\u2026He\u2019s dreading it.\n\nBut\u2026 \n\n\u201cTooru?\u201d\n\u201cHmm?\u201d\n\u201cDid you mean it?\u201d\n\u201cAs wonderful as I am, I don\u2019t have that great of a memory. What is it, Iwa-chan?\u201d Oikawa is smiling at him\u2014that stupid grin he\u2019s become so accustomed to. It\u2019s the type of smile that he either wants to wipe off of Oikawa\u2019s face or brush his lips against. That decision is always such a struggle\u2026\u00a0\n\u201cThat you\u2019d give up something like a soulmate for this?\u201d It\u2019s still a little hard to believe even when he says it out loud. Before, the words seemed like something he had dreamed, told himself as a reassurance, but hearing it our loud\u2026 that made it real.\nOikawa laughs at first, quiet and breathless. \u201cYou put too much faith in that stuff, Iwa-chan.\u201d\n\nHow can I not? It\u2019s normal, isn\u2019t it?\n\nBut Oikawa continues before he can say anything, almost like he doesn\u2019t have to think about the question. \u201cOf course I would. I think I\u2019d always choose this.\u201d\u00a0\nThe wind sends chills down his spine, brings goose bumps to his skin, but Oikawa is warm. His hand is always so warm. He doesn\u2019t want to let go.\u00a0\nSo don\u2019t. \u00a0\nAnd that\u2019s the ideal option. But it\u2019s the unknown of the future that scares him. Getting in so deep with this may have been a bad idea. Because even if he and Oikawa don\u2019t want to let go, that may not hold true in the future. Anything could happen.\n\u201cEverything is going to change soon, isn\u2019t it?\u201d It will. Next weekend is potentially their last volleyball match together. (Potentially, because he still hopes, no knows, that this time they\u2019re going to win and go to Nationals. There will be more. That won\u2019t end yet.) But even when volleyball is over, the rest of the school year will be filled with preparations for college and graduation. So much will change, will continue to change. \u00a0\u00a0\nOikawa frowns.\u00a0 \u201cYeah, but not completely. We\u2019ll still be together. Even though we\u2019re going to different schools we can still live together. They\u2019re not that far apart.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want a fresh start?\u201d It would be the perfect chance.\n\u201cWhy would I?\u201d\n\u201cBecause letting go now is easiest.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a twinge of pain on his arm, like someone just pinched him, but before he can say anything, Oikawa leans forward and brushes their lips together, kissing him for a moment before murmuring against his lips, \u201cJust because something is easy doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the best choice.\u201d\nHe almost laughs. Almost. But instead he presses their foreheads together, swallows any protests or arguments, just looks at Oikawa. Can\u2019t tear his eyes away. \u201cWow, that\u2019s deep. Where\u2019d you get that?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re acting like nothing I say is meaningful, Iwa-chan.\u201d He presses another kiss to his lips, leans in closer.\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s usually not,\u201d Iwaizumi manages to get out between Oikawa\u2019s insistent kisses. \u00a0\nOikawa stops with the kisses, but doesn\u2019t pull back, allows their foreheads to continue resting against each other. \u201cRude.\u201d\n\u201cShut up or I\u2019m going home.\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t let you. You\u2019re here and I\u2019m not letting you leave.\u201d\nIt\u2019s said as a joke, but he wonders if there\u2019s more meaning behind it than Oikawa lets on, wonders if it applies to more than just this particular instance. He\u2019s about to say more, but stops when he feels Oikawa shiver beneath his touch. It really is cold out\u2026 \u201cCome on, we\u2019re going inside. And I don\u2019t care what you say, but I\u2019m going to bed.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, okay.\u201d He takes Iwaizumi\u2019s hand, lets him pull him to his feet so they can head back inside, all thoughts of the cold night air forgotten, replaced with thoughts of holding each other in Oikawa\u2019s warm bed.\n\u2026\nIwaizumi thinks about Oikawa\u2019s words later\u2014about what\u2019s easy and what\u2019s best. On one hand, ending this would be easy. It\u2019s a break that will hurt, but will ultimately cause less pain in the long run. But then there\u2019s the other side of it\u2014the one where he doesn\u2019t want it to end, where he doesn\u2019t want there to be any sort of break between them.\nIt\u2019s not that he wants to give up that easily. Because he doesn\u2019t. He\u2019s willing to fight for this, but wonders if it\u2019s futile in the end\u2014a big waste of time.\nTime. That\u2019s funny, because time is the thing that\u2019s keeping them on edge like this. It\u2019s what\u2019s making this all so difficult.\n(Sometimes he wishes the timers on their wrists were real, had some sort of physical manifestation. Because then he could act on the urge to smash it and stop their time from slowly ticking away.)\nHe can\u2019t imagine looking down at a timer that slowly counts down their time together, that is signaling when things will break between them. For that, he\u2019s not envious of Oikawa. He wonders how Oikawa can look at that every day, a constant reminder that they have a time limit placed on them.\nAt least he doesn\u2019t know when it will end. Watching their time tick by with each passing day would be even more painful. Having the inevitable loom over them as an unknown is one thing. To know the exact amount of time until it is over, until they will break is horrifyingly cruel.\nFor that reason, he\u2019s almost glad he has a zero on his wrist. Almost.\nEven though he doesn\u2019t want it to end\u2014never wants it to end\u2014running is easy. Ending it is easy.\nSomething that can never last is something that should be ended. Before it hurts too much and they\u2019re at the point of no return.\nAnd maybe that\u2019s selfish. Maybe. Probably.\nBut hurting more now than later is the best option. Selfish or not, it\u2019s the best\u2014the only\u2014option.\n\u2026\nThe snow falls slowly around them. The storm from earlier that had left heavy snow covering the whole city had tapered off to a much quieter and peaceful snowfall. It\u2019s serene, beautiful. A memory that will stick in his head, one he\u2019d rather remember than what he\u2019s about to do.\nOikawa is chattering about something\u2014Iwaizumi\u2019s not really sure what about, it\u2019s hard to focus when he\u2019s trying to gather the courage to do this\u2014their fingers loosely intertwined, linking them together.\n\u201cIwa-chan?\u201d Oikawa squeezes his hand, drawing him out of his thoughts. \u201cEverything okay? You\u2019re really quiet.\u201d\nNow or never. \u201cCan we talk?\u201d\n\u201cWe already are talking,\u201d Oikawa jokes, but Iwaizumi can see the curiosity in his eyes, the slight worry behind them. They stop walking, feet firmly planted in the snow, and they\u2019re just looking at each other.\nHe realizes that Oikawa is waiting for him to say what he needs to, and for a moment, he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll be able to. But then it\u2019s tumbling out all at once, so quickly the words jumble together a little. \u201cI think this needs to stop.\u201d\n\u201cW-what?\u201d Oikawa\u2019s hand goes limp in his. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d He asks even though he knows exactly what Iwaizumi means.\n(It shouldn\u2019t feel like he just shot someone dead. It shouldn\u2019t, but it does.)\nFor a second he wants to take the words back, to pretend this never happened, but it\u2019s out there now and he realizes it needs to be. Maybe that\u2019s selfish, but it\u2019s something that at least needs to be addressed.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t keep doing this.\u201d\nOikawa rips his hand away, his initial shock quickly turning to anger. It\u2019s the response that Iwaizumi feared\u2014expected, but feared. \u201cWhy not? If we\u2019ve got time and we\u2019re both happy then why does it have to end?\u201d\n\u201cBecause it will eventually! We can\u2019t keep denying that.\u201d\n\u201cSo I\u2019m only good enough until something better comes along?\u201d\nIwaizumi sighs angrily, grips Oikawa\u2019s arm tightly. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean, and you know it. I\u2019d choose you every single time, but\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBut what? Who cares what some dumb clock says? Why is there a rule that I can't find someone I want to be with on my own?\u201d\nHe\u2019s heard this before. He\u2019s heard this so many times before, and he doesn\u2019t get why Oikawa still doesn\u2019t understand that soulmates will trump any other relationship. There\u2019s no chance of this lasting once their time runs out. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t let me hold you back. I don\u2019t want to be the one who does that!\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t! You never do!\u201d Oikawa grabs his shoulders, holding onto him tightly. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you see that? Why can\u2019t you see that I want this? That I need you?\u201d\nHe\u2019s breathing heavy, looks upset and frazzled and heartbroken. And there\u2019s a pang in Iwaizumi\u2019s heart because he\u2019s the one who caused this in the first place.\n\u201cWhy do you want to give up so easily?\u201d Oikawa asks quietly. He\u2019s still squeezing Iwaizumi\u2019s shoulders tightly, like holding on will somehow prevent the end. Really, it\u2019s just prolonging the inevitable, isn\u2019t it?\n\u201cBecause we don\u2019t have forever.\u201d He doesn\u2019t raise his voice, says it quietly, eyes averted from Oikawa\u2019s. \u201cNo matter how much time there is left, one day it\u2019s going to run out. I don\u2019t want to get to that point and have it hurt worse than ending it now would.\u201d\n\u201cBut we still have plenty of time left. Why not give it a chance and see\u2014?\u201d\n\u201cHow much time is left?\u201d Iwaizumi asks. \u201cAnd I want an honest answer. If you tell me, I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d\nIt\u2019s something they\u2019ve never said, something they\u2019ve always feared talking about. But he wants it in the open now. He wants to know.\n\u201cNone.\u201d\nThat, he isn\u2019t expecting. At all. \u201cNone? What do you mean?\u201d There\u2019s so much confusion, but he can\u2019t help but notice the way his heartbeat picks up its pace. Is there a possibility that\u2014?\n\u201cMine\u2019s at zero,\u201d Oikawa mutters. \u201cIt\u2019s been at zero for as long as I can remember. It doesn\u2019t run.\u201d\n\nWhat? \n\nOikawa must see the shocked look on his face because he continues. \u201cI know it\u2019s not normal. I still don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s like this, but\u2026\u201d\n\nNo way. There\u2019s no way.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry I lied. I couldn\u2019t help it. I couldn\u2019t help that I fell in love with you even though I\u2019m not supposed to.\u201d Their eyes finally meet. Oikawa\u2019s are glassy, the beginnings of tears in them now that the truth is finally out. \u201cHajime, say something. Please say something.\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t. Instead, he leans in and kisses him, catching Oikawa completely off guard. But still, Oikawa kisses him back despite the confusion he must be feeling, and for once it feels like everything is going to work out. It\u2019s weightless. There are no worries, no doubts, no fears. For once Iwaizumi is completely free because this isn\u2019t a maybe or a possibility anymore. It\u2019s a definite. A forever.\nBecause of course it would work out where they\u2019ve had forever within their grasps this whole time, have been dancing around it, unable to see. But now it\u2019s completely clear.\u00a0\n\u201cMine too,\u201d he whispers when they pull apart. \u201cMine has been at zero ever since I first looked at it.\u201d\nOikawa freezes, sucks in a breath slowly when he realizes what this means. \u201cDo you think\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve known each other since we were babies. There would have been no way for us to know if it hit zero back then.\u201d This is all still a little unbelievable. Amazing, perfect, but unbelievable that it\u2019s working out this way.\nOikawa nods. \u201cAnd even if for some reason we\u2019re not, there\u2019s no way to know if there really is someone else out there, so why not continue this?\u201d\nThere\u2019s no reason to tear them apart this time. None. So he doesn\u2019t protest, doesn\u2019t doubt anything when he wraps his arms around Oikawa in a warm embrace. They\u2019re together. They can be together now. For all time, for all eternity. Forever.\nNothing is in their way.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe this,\u201d Oikawa manages to get out, somewhere between a laugh and a sob. His eyes are still slightly teary from before. \u201cAll of this time\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAll of this time,\u201d Iwaizumi repeats, feeling similar, still unable to completely process this all so quickly. Everything he wanted\u2014they wanted\u2014is more than just a possibility now. It\u2019s a guarantee.\nThey don\u2019t speak anymore after that. Oikawa leans in and kisses him and it\u2019s perfect. It\u2019s the best thing he could ever ask for.\nThis had started as a night he wanted to remember nothing about, but now, now he wants to remember everything. He doesn\u2019t want to forget a single detail.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter that it\u2019s freezing out, that they\u2019re outside on a cold winter night. It doesn\u2019t matter that snow is falling on them, that their feet are chilled and uncomfortable from standing on a sidewalk covered in snow for so long that they can feel the cold starting to seep into their bones. It doesn\u2019t matter that their cheeks are rosy, that they\u2019re shivering the slightest bit because they should have been home a long time ago instead of spending so much time walking there.\nAll that matters is that they\u2019re holding onto each other tightly, lips locked and hearts thudding in their chests.\nIwaizumi pulls back first, and Oikawa whines a little, starting to protest their loss of contact. \u201cLet\u2019s go home, Tooru.\u201d\nOikawa looks like he wants to kiss him again, like he\u2019d rather spend all night outside just being, just existing, here with each other. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d\nHe rests his hand on Oikawa\u2019s cheek, leans in to press one last quick and chaste kiss against his lips before he pulls back and takes his hand. Their fingers are intertwined, linked. \u201cWe\u2019ve got forever for this.\u201d\n\u2026\nGraduation brings change. Everything will be different now. No more high school, no more volleyball. They\u2019ll be at different universities that are nearby, granted, but it\u2019s still going to be different not to see each other at school every day, and they\u2019ll no longer be playing volleyball together like they\u2019ve always been.\nBut it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay because they\u2019re going to live together, share a small apartment in Tokyo that\u2019s nearby both of their universities. It\u2019s okay because they\u2019re together, happy.\n\u201cI love you,\u201d Iwaizumi says when they\u2019re alone together after graduation, ready to face their futures by each other\u2019s sides.\u00a0\nOikawa smiles. \u201cI love you too.\u201d\nAnd Iwaizumi leans in close, kisses him with a sort of finality\u2014an irreversible promise sealed between them. \u00a0\n\n(Together: forever)\n\nIt\u2019s something they\u2019ll always be."
