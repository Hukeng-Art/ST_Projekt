    "text": "\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEddie is sure there is a special spot reserved in hell for Monday mornings.\n\u00a0\nHis abuela has a select choice of rapid-fire Spanish words for them.\n\u00a0\nFirst misfire: he overslept, which happens often enough that he has enough sense to set his alarm earlier than necessary to account for it, but all the time in the world couldn\u2019t seem to catch him today. Chris has no clean shirts to wear to school, all of them either in a pile in his room or inside the dryer Eddie never started after getting home from a late shift last night and instead passing out directly into his bed. He\u2019s shaking the wrinkles out of a shirt he found crumpled under Chris\u2019s bed as they rush out the door, eating cereal for breakfast without milk from a Ziploc bag, while simultaneously battling Eddie\u2019s near and dear friend\u2014 LA morning commute traffic!\n\u00a0\nAnd as if the universe decided it wasn\u2019t enough nonsense to throw on a Monday morning at Eddie to warrant a few premature gray hairs, he was supposed to sign up for parent-teacher conferences today.\n\u00a0\nThis is when abuela spits her few choice words. Or really, many.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn an effort to go paperless, Christopher\u2019s school had set up some sort of online sign-up page for the parents to log into and choose a time slot to meet with their children\u2019s teachers next month. But within minutes and every parent in the school trying to long in at once, the site inevitably crashed, leaving hundreds of people on hold with the unsuspecting school secretary now tasked with fielding calls and scheduling meetings their technology could not. Eddie feels for them, but at the same time, if they\u2019d just sent Chris home with a half a sheet of paper, hell, a quarter sheet could suffice, for Eddie to sign up on, they\u2019d have avoided this massively migraine-inducing start to their Monday morning, right?\n\u00a0\nEddie noted some parents stayed behind after drop-off to schedule their conferences in person, but Eddie had to rush to work, so he\u2019s got his abuela on the line with the school, and listens to her complain about their choice in call hold music for the entire twenty-minutes he\u2019s at a stand-still on the highway.\n\u00a0\nThe car barely rolls to a stop in its parking spot before Eddie\u2019s got his bag over one shoulder and is all but running inside to change into uniform, head upstairs, wait and wait and wait some more for his latest parenting crisis and his most god-awful morning in a while to be behind him. He\u2019s just going to hop up the stairs real quick and find a nice comfortable spot on the couch to to sulk in Monday morning blues (and maybe mute his abuela, its not personal he\u2019s just on thin ice with patience today.)\n\u00a0\nHe is immediately met with the sight of his teammates huddled around the kitchen counter by a basket of breakfast pastries that look like they could literally solve every problem in Eddie\u2019s god-awful morning (Carbs! No magic quite like \u2018em!) and is already feeling the slightest bit better at the sight. He\u2019s just happy to see his friends, his family, all in what appear to be much better moods than his, of course. His sudden uptick in mood has absolutely nothing to do with the way a certain blonde-haired firefighter catches his eye almost immediately upon his arrival, before Eddie even makes landing on the last step. Absolutely not. Obviously.\n\u00a0\nIts his friends. Plural.\n\u00a0\nHe hopes his friends-plural miss how he almost trips over a chair when he sees that smile aimed directly at him, like its nothing and everything all at once, suppressing the urge to grin back.\n\u00a0\nHe catches himself in a seat on the couch, phone in hand.\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s content to leave his abuela to her own devices on hold with the school for a minute in favor of sinking into the warm feeling of being here, hoping a little good spirit can rub off on him. He looks on at the three of his teammates with a hint of a smile still playing on his lips and its evident almost immediately what\u2019s happening. Not that it\u2019s really a shock to Eddie in the slightest.\n\u00a0\nEven from this far away and only half focused on their antics, the better half of his attentions still clinging to the hold music on abuela\u2019s line, there\u2019s no mistaking the criminally red tinge to Buck\u2019s cheeks, the pressing laugher that hangs on the edges of Hen and Chim\u2019s smiles\u2014they\u2019re teasing Buck.\n\u00a0\nEddie isn\u2019t sure what for, exactly, but whatever it is has got them wrapped up in their own little bubble, so it must be good, whatever Buck did to warrant it this time.\u00a0 Hen is hunched over the counter, her fingers drumming excitedly and her laugh loud and oddly comforting to hear this morning. It\u2019s having the complete opposite reaction on Buck though, Eddie notes, as the guy squints his eyes shut like he can physically shield himself from their banter, his blush spreading while Chim shakes him by the shoulders on Hen\u2019s right, muttering something Eddie can\u2019t make out.\n\u00a0\nBuck looks like he\u2019s one second away from throwing an everything bagel at Chim and he gets redder, saying something Eddie believes is along the lines of \u201cnot today\u201d which Hen only counters with \u201cyou say that every day\u201d.\n\u00a0\n\u201cEddito? You still there?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, yeah, sorry, just got to work,\u201d Eddie shift his weight forward on the couch, pulls the phone up to his ear and shakes his head out of his thoughts, struggling to pull his eyes away from those absolutely ridiculous Buckley dimples he can see from all the way over here still\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u201cI just got the secretary, she said I am now third in line.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGreat,\u201d Eddie lets out an anxious breath, \u201cGood, you know we need the\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSeven pm slot on Tuesday night,\u201d his abuela finishes seamlessly, \u201cContrary to whatever you may believe, I\u2019m not crazy.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYet.\u201d\n\u00a0\nShe hums on the line and Eddie laughs, twisting the sole of his shoe on the floor nervously, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m not gonna keep you, I got it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAbuela\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re at work, I know what I\u2019m doing,\u201d she argues in a tone Eddie is used to never fighting his way back from, \u201cI\u2019ll just text you when I get the time.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSince when do you know how to text?\u201d Eddie\u2019s eyebrows furrow together.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYour friend Evan showed me how, at dinner last week,\u201d she says, very matter-fo-fact, like it isn\u2019t supposed to make Eddie\u2019s heart somersault thinking about his best friend teaching his grandmother how to send emojis while he was at family dinner.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo one calls him Evan, abuela,\u201d Eddie tucks his cheek to one shoulder before he sports a blush of his own, \u201cThat would make him sound like an actual adult, which is giving him too much credit.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell he was very helpful, unlike someone I know,\u201d she sings, pointedly, \u201cAnd very nice. And liked my food. So I\u2019ll call him Evan.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhatever makes you happy abuela.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo I\u2019ll text you,\u201d she says, \u201cRelax, go eat some breakfast, you\u2019re always grumpy without breakfast.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI had breakfast.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTwo cheerios you stole from your son doesn\u2019t count.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGive Evan a kiss on the cheek for me.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s lucky he\u2019s already sitting, his voice rising uncharacteristically, \u201cAbeula, I\u2019m not gonna\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAdios, Eddito,\u201d she hangs up after the sound of her blowing a kiss, and leaves Eddie to collect himself from that whirlwind of a conversation, running the back of one hand down his face and dropping his phone to his side on the other.\n\u00a0\nWith his senses mostly restored (because yeah abuela, that\u2019s cool! Lemme just walk up to the kitchen counter and kiss Evan on the cheek! He\u2019ll never figure out I\u2019m harboring the world\u2019s worst kept secret feelings for him then! Brilliant!), Eddie claps a hand on his knee, stands up and shakes out his nervous energy as he wanders slowly over to where his teammates seem to still be fully immersed in poking at whatever antics Buck has gotten himself into today.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot with you here,\u201d Eddie can make out Buck\u2019s grumbling, with his back to him, \u201cMaking those eyes at me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut my eyes are so pretty, aren\u2019t they Hen?\u201d Chim comically bats his lashes and it makes Eddie really laugh for the first time today, as he jumps up from his seat and heads over.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, sure they are Chim, but you know whose eyes are even prettier?\u201d but Hen is looking directly at Buck when she says it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhose?\u201d Eddie decides to jump into conversation when he arrives at the counter finally feeling a little better, (and it has nothing to with the way he\u2019d been tracking Buck\u2019s smile from the moment he\u2019d arrived, and everything to do with his abuela helping fix his problems, obviously,) \u201cMine?\u201d he plays along with a wink.\n\u00a0\nHen\u2019s answer catches him by surprise, because he was obviously kidding, but she just says, \u201cExactly yours, dreamy brown eyes. Look at em,\u201d she pinches his cheeks adoringly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, I agree, don\u2019t you, Buck?\u201d Chim says, and Eddie\u2019s so busy looking at Buck for a reaction to cling to that he doesn\u2019t notice Chim\u2019s face when he says it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he breathes, after a long beat, barely a word at all in his huff, \u201cYou want a bagel, Eddie? Maddie brought us breakfast.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWoah, hey, I brought them,\u201d Chim objects earning him an elbow from Buck, \u201cTechnically Maddie bought them before work for us, and I brought them here.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell thank you Maddie and Chim but uh, I am having the Monday from hell so I am going to very responsibly take all my energy and go punch something downstairs,\u201d Eddie says bouncing on his toes, \u201cJust wanted to say good morning first,\u201d and he\u2019d be lying to you if he didn\u2019t drop his gaze deliberately before starting to back up slowly towards the stairs.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAw, but Chim\u2019s face is right here,\u201d Buck squares Chim towards the group and makes a faux pass at hitting him square in the nose.\n\u00a0\nHen leans back on the counter behind her with a laugh at their antics, but adds a genuine, \u201cAnything we can do, Eddie?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh no, yeah it\u2019s just, not my best morning,\u201d he huffs, \u201cNothing going my way,\u201d and he explains as much to his friends who listen attentively, cataloguing the ins and outs of the mile-long list of things gone wrong today before it\u2019s even hit noon. Just letting it all out releases a bit of the tension, feels like half the battle.\n\u00a0\nHen commiserates with him, which also helps, says she had the same problem with Denny\u2019s school and conferences last month.\n\u00a0\n\u201cKaren ended up going without me after the whole mess, but you know Karen.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cVery thorough.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI had a novel of notes to look through on my next 24-hour shift,\u201d she smiles, \u201cThough I gotta say, punching Chim\u2019s face might have helped.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll take back the bagels.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo you want me to call the school?\u201d Buck interjects with an urgent worry, \u201cOr you know, all of us? Increase your odds? With four people on the line they gotta answer one of us at some point.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd Eddie is sure no other person should be able to do that, to care so much about you without wasting a single beat. He schools his features best he can and brushes off the gesture, \u201cI got abuela on it, you know her and her charm. Second only to yours,\u201d he says without thinking, and blinks down to his feet to avoid catching any reactions of any kind, \u201cBut I\u2019m gonna go punch something anyway, not Chim.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou were always my favorite, Eddie!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSave me a muffin!\u201d he yells, before turning to hop down the stairs to the small gym, maybe less so to punch out his frustration and more so to punch out his feelings. That dumb smile still echoing in his mind.\n\u00a0\nHe catches the tail end of something Chim yells that sounds like \u201cA bagel? You were supposed to ask\u2014\u201d but he misses the rest, already hitting the first floor.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEddie\u2019s not sure how much time has passed when he sits back on a small bench in the gym beside a punching bag, a thin bead of sweat rolling down his face. Couldn\u2019t have been too long, but its enough, energy expended and his focus almost fully realigned. He\u2019s still got his AirPods in, listening to some music that\u2019s obnoxious and loud and adult and probably very out of character (Buck has made fun of his music choices before, but Eddie\u2019s sure it\u2019s really just an extreme to counter all the Disney tunes on loop in his home.)\n\u00a0\nAbuela had said soon, and he\u2019s checking his phone again and again waiting for that soon to be now.\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s just about to call her when someone jumps into the room.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou come to tell me you ate the last bagel?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf I did, you think I\u2019d tell the truth, or just pin it on Chim?\u201d Buck quirks, his eyes almost squinting shut, \u201cYou feeling better?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes, actually,\u201d Eddie sighs, dejectedly pushing the bag away from him with little enthusiasm, \u201cThough, I\u2019d be perfect if I got the seven pm conference slot.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWhen he looks back up, it seems like Buck is just finishing a sentence he missed. Between his distracted state and his loud music still playing in his ears, Eddie didn\u2019t hear it, so he adds, \u201cYou say something?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBuck huffs something that sounds like no which Eddie knows means yes, he did say something.\n\u00a0\nEddie doesn\u2019t press it though, just picks up his phone and sees no notification present, then continues to say, \u201cI\u2019m honestly more stressed just thinking about abuela texting me the news, which, apparently, I have you to thank for, Evan,\u201d he smirks, and assumes Buck must just still be blushing from whatever Chim and Hen has been on him about upstairs.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou can be jealous abuela likes me better than you, I can handle it,\u201d Buck says, though it comes out softer than Eddie is expecting, which unexpectedly twists at his insides.\n\u00a0\nEddie drops his phone in his lap but keeps the screen open, and pats the bench next to him, signaling his friend over.\n\u00a0\nAnd at that Buck seems... confused? Conflicted? Eddie\u2019s not sure what there is to struggle with, just to sit next to him in the station gym like they\u2019ve done at least a dozen times before.\n\u00a0\nHe bounces on his feet, Eddie can almost see his thoughts bubbling outside his head, but when Eddie laughs he releases a breath-like laugh too, and sits.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Buck shakes his head, a pause, and then, \u201cYou wanna get dinner?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s 10 in the morning.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot now asshole, like later, as\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\nHis headphones suddenly sound with a loud bing that signals a text message, and when Eddie glances down quickly reads it he sighs loudly, unable to keep a smile off his face. Abeula to the rescue, as usual.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFinally,\u201d he mumbles, and looks up to see Buck shooting him the most earth-shattering, time-stopping smile Eddie has ever seen.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLike, a good finally or\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes, yes all good,\u201d Eddie instinctively drops a hand to Buck\u2019s knee and squeezes it lightly, overcome again with the warmth of knowing how much Buck cares, how Buck leans in close and cares about Eddie, about Eddie and Christopher and his family. Then convinces himself that\u2019s a totally platonic thing to feel and not get to hopeful about it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat time?\u201d Buck asks, and Eddie swears he\u2019ll invite Buck to the next conference with him if he keeps smiling like that.\n\u00a0\nHe shakes the thought, and smiles a little more, leans into the infectious optimism.\n\u00a0\n\u201c7,\u201d Eddie clicks his phone shut, pulls out the one headphone still in his right hear, the music ceasing and his distractions fully gone. He elbows Buck on his way to standing, \u201cSo, dinner?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOr not, I mean it\u2019s whatever you\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re the only guy I know who could eat his body weight in breakfast and immediately think about dinner,\u201d Eddie laughs, tries to keep the wist out of his voice, because its not the first time he\u2019s made platonic dinner plans with Buck, so he should be used to it (he\u2019s not) \u201cBut yeah, dinner sounds good, I\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\nJust when he\u2019s about to finish that sentence with something embarrassing, the alarm saves him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe can uh, make plans later?\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie nods, smiling, then they\u2019re both up and out, getting ready for a call.\n\u00a0\nEddie\u2019s shrugging on his gear, laughing at his abuela\u2019s string of excited victory texts and is about to warn Buck of the monster he\u2019s created, when he sees Hen pulling Buck into her side, squeezing an arm around his shoulder while Chim excitedly jogs backwards in front of them.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat did we say, Buckaroo?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cCan we not do the \u2018I told you so\u2019 right now?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut we told you so!\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie climbs into the truck behind them, their conversation over at his arrival, but their grins plastered wide and permanent.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo, Chim,\u201d Eddie looks up at his teammate sitting across from him, \u201cHeard you ate the last bagel, not cool man.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBuck drops his chin to his chest and taps his toes on top of Eddie\u2019s boot.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe rest of the shift passes by in a blur of low-impact calls, a really delicious dinner from Cap that could have cured every one of Eddie\u2019s Monday morning grievances alone, and some nice downtime up in the loft in between. It doesn\u2019t feel like long before he\u2019s throwing his things into his bag haphazardly and thanking Carla for staying late, letting her know he\u2019s on his way home.\n\u00a0\nHen is shutting her locker at the same time as him, with a loud sigh, \u201cDay get any better?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh god, yes,\u201d Eddie swipes a hand down his face with an exhausted groan, \u201cThank you guys.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t thank us, we didn\u2019t do anything. Just really happy for you. You deserve it,\u201d Hen winks, pats a hand onto his shoulder affectionately, \u201cThe conference thing work out?\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie assumed that\u2019s what she was already referring to, which confuses him for a beat, but he answers anyway, \u201cUh, yeah. Here\u2019s hoping LA traffic cuts me some slack getting from here to the school as soon as my shift ends.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good one,\u201d She laughs, \u201cI\u2019ll pray for you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe echoes her laughter and adds, \u201cI might need to ask Karen to be on standby. She\u2019d probably get more out of that meeting than I ever could.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh you know she would,\u201d Hen says, \u201cWhen I said a novel, I was not kidding.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think so,\u201d he slings his bag over one shoulder and starts to head out the room, \u201cWell, now I need to sleep for three days straight.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHen scoffs out a laugh, agreeing, \u201cSee you bright and early tomorrow, Eddie.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNight, Hen.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe walks out of the room down the long path to the entrance of the station, surprisingly light on his feet in a way he did not think possible at the start of his day. Its strange, how such small things flip his mood in here, in any direction, at any time.\n\u00a0\nThough, some reactions are more routine than others.\n\u00a0\n\u201cEddie! Hey,\u201d Buck springs up from where he\u2019d been leaning on the back of the ladder truck waiting to walk Eddie out to his car.\n\u00a0\nYeah. That one never gets old.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey,\u201d Eddie says back lamely.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo?\u201d Eddie raises his eyebrows at his friend\u2019s strange behavior.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSorry its just, it\u2019s been a while, you know?\u201d Buck laughs nervously, playing with the strap of his bag on one shoulder, \u201cBut you\u2019re good? We\u2019re uh, we\u2019re good?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, why wouldn\u2019t we be?\u201d Eddie bumps his shoulder, \u201cI know I was in a mood this morning but\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo yeah, uh,\u201d and it\u2019s endearing to Eddie, for reasons he can\u2019t name, to see Buck so uncharacteristically bashful for no reason, \u201cI can cook.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou can,\u201d Eddie nods.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI mean for dinner, I can cook dinner for us, if that sounds like something you want,\u201d Buck smiles down at him, and adds a perfunctory, \u201cOr not. I could not.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to cook, Buck,\u201d Eddie hums, \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of work just for me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI want to,\u201d Buck rushes to add, \u201cI want to cook, just for you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay then,\u201d Eddie leans into his shoulder yet again, \u201cIs it my birthday or something that I\u2019m missing?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cFunny,\u201d Buck rolls his eyes, keeps their shoulder pressed together as they arrive at Eddie\u2019s car. Eddie notices Buck\u2019s is across the lot, tries not to read into it to much. \u201cYou\u2019re off on Thursday, right?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d and again, not reading into that.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSeven on Thursday,\u201d Buck points, and that smile comes back, the glowing, hazy, feelings-inducing one from this morning, and Eddie\u2019s not sure he\u2019s processing the motion of getting into his car.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSeven on Thursday,\u201d he echoes softly, and narrowly misses the car horn when his head falls in front of him, emotions giddy and weighing him down.\n\u00a0\nThis is fine. He\u2019ll be fine.\n\u00a0\n(Carla and his blushing cheeks seem to disagree.)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt isn\u2019t until he\u2019s leaving work on Wednesday night that Eddie realizes something is off. He hadn\u2019t been able to pinpoint it since Monday, but Wednesday night, it all makes sense.\n\u00a0\nThe entire 118 has just stopped teasing him.\n\u00a0\nEddie knows he\u2019s never gotten the worst of it in the station, so he\u2019s never complained. He knows this because he\u2019s usually helping Hen and Chim with Buck, which is arguably, the worst of it. But\u2014 he\u2019s also not clueless.\u00a0 And even if he was, they\u2019ve never been shy about it before.\n\u00a0\nThe knowing glances, the quirked eyebrows and coincidences they force, the outright comments and the whispers they think he can\u2019t hear, or maybe they know he can hear and that\u2019s only more infuriating the more he thinks about it.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s fine, it\u2019s never really bothered him, really, only so much as to worry him that it\u2019ll clue Buck into the fact that they\u2019ve never exactly been wrong about it.\n\u00a0\nNot once.\n\u00a0\nBuck will get teased about anything, that sibling love from Hen and Chim (and even sometimes Bobby) that Eddie laughs at and joins in on. He knows.\n\u00a0\nBut the poking and prodding they save for Eddie usually only ever comes in conjunction with the blonde and whatever feelings they\u2019re trying to tease out of him (and at least from Eddie\u2019s side, they\u2019ve come really close.)\n\u00a0\nSo it\u2019s strange, Eddie thinks, when all of a sudden, it stops.\n\u00a0\nHe can\u2019t remember the last time Eddie mentioned getting dinner with Buck that Chim didn\u2019t immediately oggle his eyes at. He doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s ever gotten away with showing Buck a picture of Chris without Hen practically cooing in his ear. It is a 118 staple for someone to ask about the wedding when Eddie sees Buck is on dishwashing duty so he just happens to be nearby and help him with drying.\n\u00a0\nBut Wednesday shift, all three of those things happen, and he doesn\u2019t get a single reaction out of anyone.\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s not going to complain, sure, because the lack of attention should be nice for a change. But instead it\u2019s just unsettling, and gnaws at this paranoia that maybe they know something Eddie doesn\u2019t. That maybe Buck\u2019s had enough of the teasing because it\u2019s just so untrue, that he\u2019d never actually want to marry Eddie and do the dishes with him every night in their home before they fall into their bed together (hypothetically speaking, obviously, Eddie hasn\u2019t thought about this at all.)\n\u00a0\nBut when Buck sits next to Eddie on the couch and reaches his arm up around the back, behind Eddie and practically around his shoulders, and no one says a word, Eddie\u2019s so shaken he almost gets up and leaves the room. But he doesn\u2019t because, Buck\u2019s arm is practically around his shoulders. He\u2019s convinced he\u2019s either been imagining things all the years he\u2019s worked here, or he\u2019s imagining things now.\n\u00a0\nHe considers asking Buck, because that would be the easiest way to figure out what kind of strange alternate universe he\u2019s entered where his nosy friends have decided to give him space. Honestly, it\u2019s concerning. In the nicest way possible. He knows his friends. He knows Hen, he knows Chim, of all people, would have never passed up this opportunity before, when Buck is literally a centimeter from holding his hand down the stairs.\n\u00a0\nBut how do you ask your best friend about why your other friends have stopped teasing you about your feelings without making those feelings glaringly obvious? That conversation just could not end well. In any universe. For anyone.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s kind of a moot point though, Eddie realizes, because Buck either doesn\u2019t notice or doesn\u2019t care enough to notice. For every missed glance or forgotten comment that leaves Eddie knitting his brows together in confusion, Buck is completely unfazed. Eddie guesses maybe being the butt of enough jokes in the team you stop counting and cataloguing how many and what kind. It makes sense Eddie notes the change and maybe Buck just doesn\u2019t. Maybe.\n\u00a0\nBut it\u2019s fine because he\u2019s not going to complain about his friends staying out of his business. They smile and laugh and talk and it\u2019s all normal in a completely un-normal way. It\u2019s fine. He\u2019s fine. Eddie\u2019s not going to be the first person on earth to ask to get teased about his glaringly obvious feelings for his best friend the night before he has a very causal, common-place, completely normally platonic dinner at his best friend\u2019s place that he cooks for them. At seven.\n\u00a0\n(Maybe one day he\u2019ll ask someone about it. Or ask Buck out. Whichever comes first. Either way it\u2019s not happening anytime soon. Or without the world\u2019s worst blush on his face while it happens.)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe week has decided to not cut Eddie any slack, it seems, when he arrives outside Buck\u2019s door on Thursday night at 7:12 with beer and an eight-year-old.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBuck, I am so sorry\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cChristopher!\u201d Buck\u2019s eyes go wide just seconds before he\u2019s almost tackled to the floor in his doorway, catching Eddie\u2019s son in his arms, \u201cDidn\u2019t know I was getting my actual favorite Diaz tonight.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDaddy said six bad words in the car,\u201d Christopher giggles suspiciously to Buck, or rather, onto Buck\u2019s cheek, where their faces are almost pushed together in a tight hug.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDad,\u201d Buck peeks up at Eddie from where he\u2019s crouched next to Chris, still standing in the doorway, a faux authoritativeness lacing his teasing voice, \u201cWhat did we say about bad words?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cShut the fuck up.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh my goodness!\u201d Buck gasps, sending Chris into another fit of laughter before he hip checks the door to swing it shut, winks at Eddie, then throws a hysterical Chris over one shoulder and runs, tosses him with a laugh onto the couch.\n\u00a0\nEddie\u2019s like, three beats away from proposing. And he hasn\u2019t even taken the guy on a first date.\n\u00a0\nHe watches Buck toss the TV remote to Chris, who is adamant he knows how to change the channels himself, so Buck throws his hands up and backs away with a smile still steady.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSix bad words?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid I not just tell you to shut up?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cRight, seven bad words.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI cannot catch a fucking break this week, Buck.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cEight?!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI swear\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\nBuck\u2019s smile buckles under the weight of his laugh, his head dipping before grabbing a beer and tossing it to Eddie, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Eddie shakes his head, thanking Buck for the drink, \u201cLiterally, nothing bad is happening, which is rare for us, so I couldn\u2019t complain, it\u2019s just...\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cA lot?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Eddie tosses back a swig of his drink, \u201cI really am sorry though. Carla is sick and abuela had him yesterday and you know she never slows down and she wouldn\u2019t say no if I asked so I didn\u2019t want to\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWoah wait dude, that\u2019s what you\u2019re worried about?\u201d Buck asks, leaning forward from where he stands, his palms flat on his sides on his countertop, \u201cChristopher?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou said dinner\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cInvitation always includes him, always,\u201d Buck says so firmly, so wholly and genuinely, and Eddie lets out a breath he didn\u2019t know he was holding in.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Eddie whispers shyly, and Buck nods once.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe appreciates my cooking more than you do anyway.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s really not saying much, when he has my cooking to compare it to.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, you said it, not me,\u201d he points, before picking up his own beer.\n\u00a0\nEddie sinks back comfortably, an overwhelming sense of belonging hitting him here, surprising him every time it does. He looks up to check on Chris, who also apparently, feels at home here, lounging across Buck\u2019s entire couch, flipping through TV channels. Before he turns back to Buck he notices a bouquet of flowers on the counter peeking out from behind where his best friend stands, \u201cWho got you flowers?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThere\u2019s a mischievous lilt to his tone to mask the jealously already bubbling up inside him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, no one\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSomeone had to buy them,\u201d Eddie presses, \u201cUnless you got a secret admirer I don\u2019t know about?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, no, I bought them.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, it was\u2026\u201d he shakes his head, as if he\u2019s shaking out the rest of his train of thought with it, \u201cI made pasta! New recipe Bobby taught me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSounds great,\u201d Eddie shrugs at the very sudden change in conversation, but chocks it up to lack of sleep maybe, coming off a 12-hour shift Eddie knows Buck had today that he didn\u2019t. He suddenly feels bad for taking up some of Buck\u2019s only free time with him and his kid, but Buck\u2019s sporting a smile that steals Eddie\u2019s entire train of thought, and his worry right with it. \u201cProbably not much better than the boxed Mac and cheese I was gonna make tonight though.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank god you\u2019re here,\u201d the words are meant to be joking, but they hang heavy in the air between them, Eddie just a step away from Buck.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t miss it.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBuck tucks a shy smile away before peeking up at Eddie under his long lashes, \u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie\u2019s heart free-falls. Over two words.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo,\u201d Buck clears his throat, popping whatever bubble they\u2019d been floating in, \u201cYou wanna go sit at the kids table, or think your culinary talents can handle helping me?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYour faith in me is inspiring, truly,\u201d Eddie takes another sip before putting his glass behind him and stepping up to Buck\u2019s left side, \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBesides stand there and look pretty?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cUh\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cToo strong?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou mean, uh? The sauce?\u201d Eddie balks, floundering inside his own head as he reaches around Buck to grab a spoon to taste the sauce, because, it\u2019s too strong.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d Buck laughs and Eddie can feel the breath on his cheek, \u201cThe sauce.\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie tips his head back and tastes the drop of sauce on his spoon, \u201cNo yeah, not uh, not too strong.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGuess it was just me then,\u201d Buck places a gentle hand on the small of Eddie\u2019s back so he can pass behind him, grab something from a drawer on his right, \u201cI\u2019d worry about asking you to boil pasta but lucky for us,\u201d Buck leans in close, like he\u2019s about to let Eddie in on a secret, \u201cI happen to be a firefighter.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo way! Really?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cLA\u2019s finest,\u201d he brags, moving to grab three plates and finally Eddie can breathe, \u201cI\u2019m great with hot things.\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie\u2019s sure he can hear his heartbeat from three feet away, \u201cSo you can handle kitchen fires?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAmong other things.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEddie isn\u2019t sure how he ended up here. Trapped physically between couch cushions while his best friend tip-toe around his living room picking up Legos and trying not to disturb his son\u2019s sleeping form. Emotionally trapped under how that sentence sounds in his head.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI think they\u2019re multiplying...\u201d Buck whispers, crouched behind his coffee table, \u201cI swear he had like, half of these when we started.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe magic of Legos.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m about two blocks away from giving up and buying him a new set so we can just leave these here,\u201d Buck sighs, taking two very delicate steps towards the couch and, Eddie guesses, very literally, given up, \u201cWhat\u2019s your call here?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to buy my son new Legos.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s just because I\u2019m too lazy to clean them up,\u201d Buck settles his weight next to Eddie, \u201cIt\u2019s not spoiling him if it\u2019s done out of purely selfish reasons.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re a terrible influence, you know?\u201d Eddie whispers, but his smile is so wide when he says it, inches away from Buck\u2019s own that he\u2019s sure no one would believe he means it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not hearing a no in there...\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf I said no, would it matter?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSee?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay fine, I won\u2019t,\u201d Buck concedes, \u201cJust because you\u2019re a really good influence.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou want me to help clean up the Legos, right?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cCan\u2019t a guy give a compliment with no ulterior motives?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot my guy,\u201d eases off Eddie\u2019s tongue before he can realize he\u2019s saying it, and almost trips when he moves from the couch.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI compliment you all the time,\u201d Buck clears his throat and steps around the opposite side of the coffee table.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou spent 20 minutes before dinner talking about how bad my cooking was.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s not personal, I just don\u2019t think we should have to eat your raw chicken,\u201d Buck\u2019s voice drifting towards him barely above a whisper, the TV low and the lights dimmed, \u201cI\u2019m responsible and caring like that.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh really?\u201d Eddie gathers a few blocks of Legos, takes one steps forward that Buck mirrors opposite him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re responsible and caring too,\u201d Buck hums, \u201cJust not with your food.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cFeels like half a compliment...\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re smart, really smart,\u201d another step, another block, \u201cReally good under pressure.\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie blinks, and wonders again how he got here, two steps away from being nose to nose with his best friend and two breaths away from a love confession.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI think you\u2019re funny, which you\u2019ve probably never heard before, so, you\u2019re welcome,\u201d Buck continues, and Eddie\u2019s not sure why, because he thought the compliment jokes died 3 minutes ago, but is making his insides bubble in warmth so. He rolls with it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBuck hides a small laugh in his shoulder, \u201cYou\u2019re a great dad, a great firefighter, a great friend, a great...\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie aches fo finish that sentence.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re good at just about everything, and it would be infuriating if you weren\u2019t so goddamn charming to go with it all,\u201d Buck says as he studies the pattern of his rug, traces a swirl with a finger on his free hand, then picks up a couple more legos into his hand, slightly peeks up at Eddie, who\u2019s almost closed the distance between them.\n\u00a0\nThe air is unnaturally still, which it never is with Buck, Eddie thinks, always alive and thrumming and running towards the next thing.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got...\u201d Buck starts up again in the quiet, so gently Eddie couldn\u2019t blame himself if he just tipped forward and inch and landed a kiss on his nose. But then Buck blinks, and quirks his head to one side and scrunches his nose adorably, \u201cYou\u2019ve got a lego in your hair?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou have a lego,\u201d Buck says, a giggle lining his every breath as he reaches up one gentle hand, brushed past Eddie\u2019s ear and slowly back, \u201cIn your hair.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow the hell\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI have no idea,\u201d Buck marvels at the small red block in his hand before dropping it into his pile, \u201cLooked good on you though, not shocking in the slightest.\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie\u2019s sure his cheeks rival the red hue of the lego.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDaddy?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, buddy,\u201d Eddie jumps up at the sound of Chris, stretched across the couch, groggily rubbing his eyes away, \u201cTime to go home.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHome?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, we\u2019re at Buck\u2019s, remember?\u201d he whispers gently, running and hand over, the boy\u2019s shoulder, \u201cAnd it\u2019s bedtime, so we gotta go home.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBuck\u2019s bedtime?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s about to refute his small statement, but Buck beats him to it, \u201cYeah, I am so sleepy. You wore me out, Superman.\u201d He even tacks on a yawn for effect. This guy.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe could have a sleepover.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, Christopher, you have school tomorrow.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to go.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot an option\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnother time,\u201d Buck nods. He bends down to Chris\u2019s eye level and continues very seriously, \u201cYou wanna pinky promise on it?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cPinky promise?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most serious promise in the world. My sister taught me how to do them when I was smaller than you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSmaller than me?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cCrazy concept, I know,\u201d Buck laughs lightly, steadying himself with one hand on the end of the couch, peeking up at Chris, \u201cBut the special thing about pinky promises, is that you can never, ever break them.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cEver?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNever,\u201d Buck shakes his head, \u201cSo I\u2019ll pinky promise you, Christopher, that if you go home now, and do a good job in school tomorrow, that we can have a sleepover the next time you and your dad aren\u2019t busy,\u201d Buck smiles and holds out his hand, one pinky pointing towards Christopher, \u201cWe got a deal?\u201d\n\u00a0\nChris seems to consider it for only a minute before linking his pinky around Buck\u2019s, beaming so brightly you\u2019d never know it was the middle of the night.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Buck says, holding his and Chris\u2019s hands together with his free hand and a gentle squeeze.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Eddie whispers, scooping Chris up off the couch and heading for the door.\n\u00a0\nBuck trails behind, and Eddie can feel Chris giggling on his shoulder.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe sooner you go to sleep at home, the sooner you go to school, and the sooner we can have that sleepover,\u201d Buck says, and adds in a show whisper, \u201cMaybe we could get rid of your boring old dad too.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey!\u201d\n\u00a0\nChris\u2019s laughter shakes his shoulder, and Eddie clings to the little bits of joy.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPinky promise?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSee what you\u2019ve created here, Buck?\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie can feel Buck ruffle his son\u2019s curls adoringly before dropping to another whisper, but maybe this time, Eddie thinks, one he\u2019s not supposed to hear, \u201cSorry kid, no can do on that one. Between me and you, and don\u2019t ever tell him I said this, but I actually kinda like having your dad around.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s glad he heard it anyway.\n\u00a0\nWhen they reach the front door, Chris is slipping back into sleep, and Eddie turns to face Buck, speaking so carefully as to not disturb the peace they\u2019ve created, and maybe have to pinky promise their way into more.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank you, Buck,\u201d Eddie lets out in a quiet breath, \u201cFor everything.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, it was,\u201d Buck\u2019s smile is quiet too, \u201cIt was perfect.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe silence of the night washes over them once more and Eddie takes that as his cue to leave, but once step and he\u2019s abruptly stopped\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe flowers were for you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe feels the confusion crowd his face.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe flowers, that you asked about before,\u201d Buck clarifies, quickly sporting one of those lego red blushes too, \u201cI bought them. For you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, it was, it was Hen\u2019s idea, and you know, I trust her advice on just about anything in the world, so,\u201d Buck says, but shakes his head after a beat like he\u2019s got to get rid of the whole thing, \u201cSorry, if that\u2019s weird, or anything, I just\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s nice,\u201d Eddie can barely make sense of his own words over how loud his heart thumps in his chest, \u201cNo one\u2019s ever bought me flowers before.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, they\u2019re idiots then.\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie bites his bottom lip, \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing you\u2019re just telling me now though, cause if Chris had seen \u2018em, he might pinky promise you into buying them every day.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI would,\u201d Buck breathes out, \u201cI would buy them every day.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt would be a lie for Eddie to say the next time he thinks about Buck would be at his front door at 7:12 the next morning, but having the guy stand there holding a Spider-Man backpack and a bouquet of flowers sure does help.\n\u00a0\n\u201cUm, good morning?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cForgot Chris\u2019s backpack at my place last night,\u201d Buck pants, like he\u2019s just run here to deliver it personally (Eddie sees his car next to the driveway), \u201cDamn, I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d make it in time.\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie surveys the situation as Buck leans against his doorframe. Buck literally looks like he rolled out of bed and came straight here, his hair askew and his shirt wrinkled, the kids size backpack hanging funnily over his one shoulder.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a sight. An alarmingly attractive one no one should be able to pull off at 7:12 in the morning.\n\u00a0\nEddie focuses his breathing, \u201cAnd the flowers?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell I guess forgetting runs in the family.\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie laughs, watches the morning glow wash over Buck and thinks he\u2019d really like to get used to this.\n\u00a0\n(He doesn\u2019t know how he\u2019s gotten this deep, so far gone, for a guy who so clearly and obviously just wants to be friends. And he\u2019s been pretty deep before, literally. Nothing compares to this.)\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, thank you, for making the trip. You really didn\u2019t have to,\u201d Eddie smiles, because he really didn\u2019t.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, no, its fine, you know, I pinky promised with the contingency that he went to school today and you can\u2019t do that without a backpack so\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, but you could have texted me, cause\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBuck!\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie turns around at his son\u2019s voice, appearing just behind him, dressed and ready for school, breakfast eaten, shoes tied, and... a backpack over his shoulders.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis is not his school backpack.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt is not,\u201d Eddie nods, biting his lips together to keep from laughing as the realization hits Buck head-first.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAwesome.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cJust a bag to put all our toys in for when we visit our friend Buck,\u201d Eddie points, his laugh starting to escape, \u201cI said you should have texted.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBuck ignores his teasing and leans into the arm he has propped on the doorframe, peeking over Eddie\u2019s shoulder to wave, \u201cMorning Christopher!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBuck brought home the stuff you forgot at his house last night,\u201d Eddie turns to face the boy too, \u201cWhat do we say?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank you!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSuddenly, that hour less of sleep feels worth it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBuck\u2019s gonna come with us to school, that sound good?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cReally?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cReally?\u201d Buck quirks.\n\u00a0\n\u201cReally,\u201d Eddie affirms, patting Christopher on the head as he pushes through the doorway and passes them, headed for the car, \u201cIts closer to the station than you going all the way home and back. Plus I\u2019ll get you coffee on the way.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, aren\u2019t you a catch!\u201d Buck sputters leaning back so Eddie can shut and lock the door.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSays the guy who bought me flowers.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey Chris, you want some flowers?\u201d Buck yells, though he doesn\u2019t tear his gaze from Eddie\u2019s, grinning madly, \u201cYour dad\u2019s mean and ungrateful.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s not nice, dad,\u201d Eddie hears Chris say, somewhere not too far off, but he keeps his eyes locked on Buck\u2019s.\n\u00a0\n\u201cVery not nice,\u201d He mutters, then takes the bouquet from Buck\u2019s hands, and starts towards the car with a wink.\n\u00a0\nHe hears Buck call shotgun, like there was another option, but still, it makes Chris laugh so he\u2019ll let it slide, then tucks his nose into the bouquet and sighs at the beautiful scent.\n\u00a0\nIt really shouldn\u2019t be allowed, to have to platonically accept flowers from a guy and pretend the gesture hasn\u2019t been knotting up your insides since last night, and probably won\u2019t lend itself to unknotting any time in the distant future.\n\u00a0\nHe spends half the ride keeping Buck and Chris from making any more pinky promises (a puppy and a trip to Disney World come up in exchange for Eddie to stop cooking for a month) and the other half working up the nerves of steel to face the wrath he\u2019s sure to have to endure from his friends when they walk into work.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s been uncharacteristically quiet for the past week, but Eddie is willing to bet, pinky promise on it, that he won\u2019t be able to show up to the station with Buck and a bouquet and walk away from it unscathed.\n\u00a0\nHe can practically hear Chim\u2019s laugh, the gentle knowing shoulder bump from Hen, that look from Bobby.\n\u00a0\nWhen Eddie parks the truck, he grabs the flowers from the back seat and jumps out, but Buck stays still in his seat, watching Eddie\u2019s movements with an unreadable expression.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou joining us for work today, Firefighter Buckley?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBuck stays still, his eyes grazing Eddie\u2019s stance, from head to bouquet, \u201cYou\u2019re bringing the flowers?\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie\u2019s not really sure what to say, caught in between preserving his feelings and easing the crease in Buck\u2019s brows. So he settles on a very matter-of-fact, \u201cThey\u2019ll die if I leave them in here.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe must like that answer a lot, and it\u2019s not the weather that has Eddie feeling warmer suddenly.\n\u00a0\nEddie\u2019s trying to keep up with the new spring in Buck\u2019s step, chasing him across the parking lot, but it\u2019s a lost cause when he spots Hen slipping her boots on in the locker room and is running full sprint ahead, yelling something Eddie assumes has to do with his flowers. He laughs quietly to himself before he hears a car door shut beside him, finds Chim to be the owner, and braces for impact.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLook who\u2019s showing up to work together!\u201d is what Eddie trains his ears to hear and his embarrassment not to reflect.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGood morning, Eddie!\u201d is all he gets.\n\u00a0\nIn all honesty that takes him more time to recover from.\n\u00a0\n\u201cUh, hey Chim,\u201d he tightens his grip on his bag, swings the flowers behind his back in a very inconspicuous way. And nothing.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid you guys get stuck in that traffic too? God, I think I heard that new One Direction song loop on the radio 3 times before I got out of a standstill.\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie blinks slowly, you guys, so he knows.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, we dropped Chris off at school first, so I think we avoided most of it,\u201d Eddie feels his stomach swoop but that\u2019s the only reaction he\u2019s getting. And he just committed two of the highest offenses on the list of things to tease Buck and Eddie about. He adds to cover up his distress, \u201cAnd One Direction broke up years ago, old man.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, it was one of those guys,\u201d Chim shakes his head, as if this was the thing most troubling to him this morning.\n\u00a0\nAlright, maybe this was part of his plan, Eddie ponders, make him admit it himself. Game on, Han, \u201cHow was your night?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, it was good,\u201d Chim nods, as they cross into the station, \u201cAlbert came over for dinner with Maddie.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAh, sounds nice,\u201d Eddie hums, \u201cDid you cook?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMe? Very funny, Diaz,\u201d Chim looks up at him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, me either.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh that\u2019s right, you had your dinner last night, Maddie mentioned it,\u201d Chim smiles, and how did Maddie know? \u201cYou have a nice night?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Eddie nods, so quickly it gives his every emotion away, perfect bait, but Chim just smiles, \u201cBuck\u2019s a good cook, but I told him I\u2019d give him a run for his money next time. You and Maddie should come.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I thought you said you had a nice night?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI did,\u201d Eddie\u2019s eyebrows scrunch in confusion.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna poison him and invite your old man and his big sister to the next one? After a nice night?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t think that\u2019s how you use the phrase \u2018your old man\u2019.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTake care of him, Diaz,\u201d Chim holds a hand tenderly to his chest and then pats Eddie on the shoulder, before trotting off to the locker room.\n\u00a0\nTake care of... the flowers? Maybe?\n\u00a0\nBuck\u2019s practically skipping over when Eddie walks in, still half hiding the flowers Chim really must want him to take care of and Buck\u2019s pulled them out of seclusion to show Hen before Eddie can even put his bag down, telling anyone who will listen about his very chivalrous act of delivering them to Eddie\u2019s doorstep personally, and how Chris had picked one himself to keep in his backpack for school. Chim\u2019s quiet as he changes, and Hen\u2019s gushing smile rests in her hands where she watches them, and no longer able to hide the flowers, Eddie hides his face that will give it all away behind his locker door.\n\u00a0\nHe really wishes someone would call him out on it, which should have probably been the first red flag.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThings... escalate after that first week, and quickly. Eddie\u2019s stopped questioning it.\n\u00a0\nOr, he tries.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou think they\u2019re being weird?\u201d Eddie slips the question in casually enough one day, on the loft couch during down time on a shift, Buck sprawled our next to him, legs dangling off the arm opposite him, scrolling mindlessly on his phone.\n\u00a0\nBuck seems perturbed by Eddie\u2019s interruption of his reading of facts on fulls moons he\u2019s just researched, but other than that, nothing, \u201cWho?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cEveryone.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to say, if you\u2019d shut up for a minute and listen to me,\u201d Buck drawls, \u201cIt\u2019s a full moon tonight and I read\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, no, I mean, everyone,\u201d Eddie traces his eyes around the room, stops on the three other members of his team sitting by the kitchen, watching Bobby cook dinner, \u201cYou don\u2019t think they\u2019re being weird?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI think you\u2019re being weird,\u201d Buck says, drops a cheek onto Eddie\u2019s thigh, \u201cAlong with 33% of the population tonight.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhere are you getting these garbage statistics from? Gimme that,\u201d Eddie scoffs and grabs for Buck\u2019s phone, but he dodges him in one swift motion, ending up even closer together.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI read it on the internet, Edmundo, so it has to be true.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, you went for the full name, huh?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cCrazy people can\u2019t have cute nicknames.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not crazy,\u201d Eddie defends, but the way Buck looks up at him from where he lays, biting a smile between his lips, the guy might not be that far off, \u201cNext you\u2019re gonna tell me I\u2019m a werewolf.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou might be,\u201d Buck shrugs, \u201cUnibrow is one of the signs...\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe reaches a hand blindly for said unibrow, and Eddie squirms from his grasp.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re the worst, you know that?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cKeep it coming, Eddie, that won\u2019t work on me anymore,\u201d Buck laughs, settling a hand gently on his cheek when he gives up on his unibrow, \u201cI know the truth now.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh yeah?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u00a0\nYou\u2019re right, he almost spills, I am crazy.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCrazy about you.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe clears his throat to suck back the words, \u201cSo you don\u2019t think our friends are being weird?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d Buck affirms, the shake of his head a gentle pressure where it has ended up resting in Eddie\u2019s lap, \u201cPoint it out to me next time you think something\u2019s up though.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSure,\u201d Eddie breathes out quickly, suddenly very interested in distancing himself from Buck\u2019s all-encompassing adoration for him even when he\u2019s crazy paranoid. He makes a fast motion to stand, jostling Buck\u2019s comfortable position, \u201cI\u2019m thirsty, you want anything?\u201d But he\u2019s steps away from the couch before he gets a proper answer.\n\u00a0\nBuck just yells, \u201cSign you\u2019re a werewolf number three: unquenchable thirst!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat Italian place by your house you like.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat about it?\u201d Eddie slips out of uniform and into a t-shirt at the end of a shift.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIs there a dress code?\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie\u2019s looking around the door to his locker at Buck quizzically, slightly worried, \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTrick question!\u201d Buck yells, and could probably wake the entire station up with his enthusiasm if it were a little later, \u201cThere isn\u2019t, but I brought us nice clothes anyway!\u201d He shoves a dress shirt at Eddie, seemingly appearing out of thin air.\n\u00a0\nEddie stumbles back with the surprise force, but tentatively grabs the shirt, his shirt\u2014 how the hell\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u201cI texted abuela and she dropped it off here before going to pick up Christopher from Carla,\u201d because Buck can obviously, read minds, along with all the other super-human perfections he sports.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOf course you\u2019ve texted abuela.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cShe\u2019s my best friend.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd what does that make me?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot my best friend,\u201d Buck smirks, like he knows something Eddie doesn\u2019t. But Eddie tries not to dwell on it, because Buck wouldn\u2019t still be smiling at him like that if their friendship were suddenly over. Buck pushes the shirt to his chest again, \u201cAnd underdressed! Put a shirt on, Diaz!\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe runs out to get the car, and Eddie tries to focus on the buttons on his shirt, and not his rapidly beating heart that hides behind them.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEddie\u2019s caught the attention of a few people on the job, sure, but it\u2019s never bothered him. He always had some excuse, kid, wife, work, or just enough politeness to take the slip of paper with the phone number with a smile and promptly toss it into the garbage once out of sight.\n\u00a0\nSomeone who has always caught people\u2019s attention on the job and never had a problem with it: Buck. Eddie\u2019s seen it enough times in action to know how to handle just about any situation he couldn\u2019t solve with one of his three handy excuses.\n\u00a0\nBut today\u2019s is new, and one Eddie and his very truthful I\u2019ve got a kid and my work schedule is crazy right now has never had to use.\n\u00a0\nBus accident in the middle of the day, minor injuries, most of the damage just some traffic piling up while they cleared the scene in the entire section. Paramedics from another house that was called to the scene have just jumped into an ambulance with the bus driver, who was looking at a broken bone or two, so Cap had the four of them stick around to do simple once-overs on some of the other passengers.\n\u00a0\nEddie is making some very lovely small talk with an elderly woman with a small cut above her right eye when he hears it. 20-something redhead flirting with Buck on his right.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not allowed to bother him. People flirting with him doesn\u2019t bother him, so people flirting with Buck absolutely can\u2019t.\n\u00a0\nBut it can\u2019t hurt to listen, right? To look out for his friend, obviously.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou were really brave out there,\u201d Eddie hears redhead say, has the audacity to bat her lashes while she says it, \u201cI saw you pull that little boy out of the broken window.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, yeah, just doing my job,\u201d Buck hums politely.\n\u00a0\n\u201cA good job,\u201d she sing-songs, \u201cYou like being a firefighter?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBuck smiles genuinely at that, while he clicks his pen light off and starts to put it back in his pocket, \u201cMore than you know.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019d like to.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBuck purses his lips, unsure.\n\u00a0\n\u201cKnow,\u201d she clarifies, \u201cI\u2019d like to know more about you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd there it is. Not the best work Eddie\u2019s witnessed, but for just coming out of bus crash, he\u2019s giving her the benefit of the doubt.\n\u00a0\nBuck seem slower on the uptake, blinking twice, as he pulls out some gauze for a small cut she has on her arm.\n\u00a0\nAnd then, \u201cOh, sorry, uh, I\u2019m\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot a hot single firefighter?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he chuckles lightly, wrapping her injury, \u201cI am really a firefighter though, I promise.\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie\u2019s never seen it happen before, seen Buck lie so easily. It\u2019s the easiest excuse, to say you\u2019re taken when in a situation like this, he\u2019s used it enough before to know it works almost every time. But only when it\u2019s true. And Eddie\u2019s known Buck\u2019s been single for well... he\u2019s known more of single Buck than any other kind.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd hot,\u201d the girl continues, a small red blush to match her hair, but she laughs good-naturedly with Buck enough for Eddie to know she\u2019s not making any more advances (he\u2019s seen Buck fend those off with effort too.)\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know about that,\u201d Buck mumbles again with another laugh, and this asshole, lying again, because everyone knows Buck knows he\u2019s hot.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell someone knows, hot taken firefighter,\u201d she teases, and Eddie sees Buck blush to match her hair. \u201cYou know, the best ones are always either taken or gay.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOr both.\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie almost chokes on the water bottle Hen had passed him.\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s finished with his patient halfway through eavesdropping, so with airways cleared of water, he stalks back to the truck and waits by the door. Buck gently pats the redhead\u2019s shoulder goodbye, waves as he walks away, and practically beams at Eddie when he\u2019s just a few steps away.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s so endearing Eddie tries his best to keep his sudden jealousy out of the way. Keyword being tries. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAll good, Buckley?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYup,\u201d Buck pops the \u2018p\u2019 cheekily, grabs Eddie\u2019s water from his hands and takes a long sip.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDidn\u2019t know you were seeing someone,\u201d and for all his efforts, it\u2019s not as biting as he had thought it\u2019d be, jealousy masking itself for the moment.\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s afraid he misjudged though, when Buck doesn\u2019t immediately answer, just pouts out his bottom lip (don\u2019t look at it Eddie, don\u2019t look) and caps Eddie\u2019s water bottle.\n\u00a0\nAnd then he laughs. Like, honest to god giggles.\n\u00a0\nEddie is stuck in fighting off doubly massive waves of butterflies and confusion, all while Buck just gazes down at him, and laughs.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s cute,\u201d he hears Buck mumble, just before climbing into the truck, calling Eddie after him.\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s so flustered that Chim makes it back to the truck before he\u2019s collected himself enough to join Buck and his giggling, so he stops him and asks urgently, confusion lacing his tone, \u201cDid you know Buck was seeing someone?\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd finally, someone who looks more confused than Eddie feels.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWas I not supposed to?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cStop it!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy? Does it\u2026\u201d Eddie squirms under Buck\u2019s touch, his fingers dancing over his pocket, \u201cTickle?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, yeah, it does,\u201d but it\u2019s barely audible through his laughter, bouncing off the walls of the hallway.\n\u00a0\n\u201cShould have thought about that before you took my keys,\u201d Buck tries to twist around Eddie\u2019s frame again, but he\u2019s got an elbow out to stop him before he can.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSomeone had to be responsible tonight,\u201d Eddie braces himself with one hand against the wall on his left, grabs the keys from his pocket with the right, and jingles them between their faces mischievously.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh and that had to be you? Big hero?\u201d Buck makes a grabby motion for them, \u201cI can do it!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna wake up the entire building.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGo back to drunk Eddie, he\u2019s more fun,\u201d Buck pouts, tickling his fingers over Eddie\u2019s waist again just to be a little shit and Eddie is so distracted he almost forgets how to unlock a door.\n\u00a0\n\u201cStill drunk, Buck,\u201d he laughs, twisting the key, \u201cJust want to get inside.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWith a sigh and a push, the door is swung open, and Eddie all but falls inside with Buck on his toes, very much still buzzed from their brief night out with the team to decompress post-shift.\n\u00a0\nThey\u2019d all had a long week and Christopher was spending the night with his aunt and if Eddie went home he\u2019d have to do laundry or wash dishes or something entirely disgustingly adult that four-beers-deep Eddie never wanted to think about.\n\u00a0\nBut Buck\u2019s place? Basically adult-proof.\n\u00a0\nSo it makes sense, when he\u2019s calling an Uber to set the address to Buck\u2019s apartment building, and it makes sense when Buck insists on paying him back that he silences him with a playful shove and a hand over his lips, and it makes sense that he kept Buck\u2019s keys hostage all night, knowing he\u2019d keep them safer and get to use them later.\n\u00a0\nWhat makes no sense is how no one says anything when Buck drags Eddie out of the bar holding his hand and telling the group the Uber was taking them home, singular.\n\u00a0\nBut Eddie\u2019s four beers and some odd collection of other alcohol deep and all he can focus on is Buck\u2019s fingers dancing up his sides.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIs this quiet enough for you?\u201d Buck makes a show of whispering loudly while Eddie kicks his door shut, locks up.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d Eddie rolls his eyes, pads around the wall by the entrance in the dark, \u201cDo you have a light switch?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have lights in your apartment?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t, sorry.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThere\u2019s a very serious pause between them, and there\u2019s enough light from the city peeking through the kitchen window that Eddie can trace the lines on Buck\u2019s face, the unmistakable scrunch that comes right before\u2014\n\u00a0\nBuck\u2019s whole body is wracked with a bubble of laughter, his forehead falling onto Eddie\u2019s before backing up down the dark entryway.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay fine,\u201d Eddie tries to remain the responsible adult, but he is overcome with laughter too, \u201cWe\u2019ll just sit here in the dark.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAt least buy me dinner first, Diaz!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ve bought you dinner before,\u201d which, Eddie reasons, is probably not the point, but he\u2019s pining. Let him do it in peace.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, I cooked dinner.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou did.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid you like it?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI did.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid Chris like it?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI think that was obvious in the way I had to drag him out your door,\u201d Eddie\u2019s answers roll off his tongue quickly, don\u2019t require as much emotional scrutiny when he\u2019s a little tipsy and sated and fuzzy and warm.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDoes Chris like me?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe question is almost sobering. Almost. Maybe if he hadn\u2019t had that last shot of tequila.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBuck\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBecause I\u2019ve never done this before and I know it\u2019s probably weird for him, and I don\u2019t know how much you\u2019ve told him but I really like Chris and I really liked having dinner with you but I won\u2019t do it again if that\u2019s not\u2026\u201d Buck flops into a puddle of long limbs on his couch, the apartment still dark, and a breathy laugh escapes, \u201cI have no idea how I\u2019m supposed to finish that sentence.\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie\u2019s always known drunk Buck was touchy-feely, even more so than an already affectionate all-the-time Buck. But the feely part of it, Eddie had never known, was so introspective.\n\u00a0\nBut drunk Eddie is the opposite of cautious, no tact, no grace, so he blurts, \u201cYou just like having dinner with me?\u201d\n\u00a0\nIt seems to break Buck out of whatever pit of feelings he\u2019s fallen into, \u201cShut up.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m hurt, Evan!\u201d He all but cackles, collapsing into the seat next to him, on a very large couch, \u201cRight to the heart.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTo the heart?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYup,\u201d Eddie leans into his space.\n\u00a0\n\u201cRight here?\u201d Buck\u2019s forgone the dramatically loud whisper, replaces it with something soft that feels less like it\u2019s said and more like it just floats across the air between them, then places one of his hands on the right side of Eddie\u2019s chest.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d Eddie giggles, wrapping a hand around Bucks and shifting them, together, to the left, \u201cHere.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cRight.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna tell Hen you got that wrong.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t, I\u2019m already on thin-ice,\u201d he giggles back, his fingers flexing over the cotton of Eddie\u2019s shirt. And then suddenly, like the lights have gone on (its still dark), \u201cOh! We could do that!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo what?\u201d Eddie prays to whoever he hears his abuela muttering to all the time that Buck\u2019s gonna keep his hand here.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIce-skating!\u201d Buck grins, like Eddie should have known, \u201cSomething other than dinner.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m terrible at ice-skating,\u201d Eddie hums absently, running his thumb in circles over the back of Buck\u2019s hand. He doesn\u2019t move it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll teach you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t even open your door tonight, and you think you could\u2014\u201d the words get caught in Eddies throat when Buck suddenly shifts his hands into his lap, so he can take one of Eddie\u2019s very calloused palms and trace over every crease, play with it gently with both of his own.\n\u00a0\nEddie isn\u2019t sure howling he takes to take that in, to watch Buck be mesmerized by him, buzzed or not.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou like my hand?\u201d Because drunk Eddie is bold.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSomething like that.\u201d Because drunk Buck makes just as good a case for Eddie to fall in love with him on the spot at regular Buck.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou can keep it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cEven when we ice skate?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSure.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd drive to work?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThey haven\u2019t driven together to work since that morning Buck came over with Christopher\u2019s backpack. But, \u201cSure.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd in the locker room when no one\u2019s looking?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf you want.\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie\u2019s reteaching himself how to breathe.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut not when we\u2019re cooking.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re so bad at cooking, Eddie.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cEvan Buckley, you better\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe doesn\u2019t finish the sentence because Buck\u2019s got his hand clutched under his chin, places a sloppy kiss to his knuckles, then drops it, holds out a pinky.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPromise?\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie promises.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSunlight filters through the windows and gently wakes Eddie up, something he\u2019d taken for granted for years, then had rarely experienced again between having a son and a job in a firehouse.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s nice to be reminded of the calming lull of the morning, muffled sounds of the city and temptation to curl back under a fuzzy blanket, no obligations awaiting him.\n\u00a0\nHe blinks his eyes open anyway, old habits, but gives into the comfort of the unfamiliar blanket he\u2019s nestled into.\n\u00a0\nHe spent the night on Buck\u2019s couch, he gathers quickly, even though all he\u2019s got to show for it is a mild headache and couch cushion creases indented on his cheeks.\n\u00a0\nBuck, apparently, spent the night on his floor. Literally.\n\u00a0\nEddie makes small movements to turn on his side, hand tucked under one cheek and propped up on an elbow, looking down to find his best friend, still in his clothes from the day before, sound asleep on the small floor space between his couch and coffee table. It couldn\u2019t be comfortable in the slightest, Eddie argues, but from the looks of Buck you\u2019d never know. Eddie\u2019s blanket falls about halfway over one of Buck\u2019s legs and a pillow fits perfectly in the narrow tunnel of space. Buck\u2019s out cold, his hair disheveled and disarrayed across the pillow, his eyelashes fluttering so briefly Eddie only catches it because of proximity.\n\u00a0\nSomethings he\u2019s never been able to take for granted: waking up to this. He seizes the opportunity.\n\u00a0\nThere is extra comfort in watching the steady rise and fall of Buck\u2019s chest as he sleeps into the morning. Their lives are so frantic, so full, and so good that way, but he doesn\u2019t remember the last time he saw Buck stop to catch his breath.\n\u00a0\nHe doesn\u2019t mean to wake him, but after a little while Eddie guesses he\u2019s pushed his luck getting away with dreamy morning-breath sighs, as he feels Buck\u2019s weight shift against the bottom of the couch.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMorning,\u201d he grumbles, rubbing at his eyes.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey there,\u201d Eddie sits up a little better, \u201cHeadache?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe nods, \u201cYou?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d and Buck reaches up and runs a gentle hand across his forehead, like that\u2019ll make it go away (and it might, Eddie thinks.)\n\u00a0\n\u201cSee? And you were the responsible one.\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie laughs lightly and watches Buck\u2019s hand flop back onto his own chest, \u201cSo, you gonna tell me why you\u2019re sleeping down there or am I supposed to magically know?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou fell asleep on the couch,\u201d Buck says, smile to match the fuzzy feeling of just waking up in the morning next to him Eddie has felt ache in his chest, \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t wanna wake you up and move you, but I also felt like a dick leaving you on my uncomfortable couch while I took that giant bed. Alone.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIt seems that\u2019s all the explanation he\u2019s going to give, like that simple fact makes it all make sense.\n\u00a0\nIn a way, Eddie thinks, it does.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo I\u2019ve been told,\u201d but he\u2019s still beaming, like he brought the morning with that smile itself, \u201cBut I\u2019ve also heard I\u2019m perfect just the way I am,\u201d he sing-songs, \u201cSo who knows what I\u2019m supposed to believe?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOne of them is definitely right.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Buck sits up, his back against the coffee table, \u201cYou look comfy on my couch.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI am comfy on your couch.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019d offer it up more but I think this floor thing was more of a one-off grand gesture.\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie gives in to the weight of a morning made beautiful by the sunshine, that laugh.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna go get us some Advil and coffee,\u201d Buck leverages his balance with a hand on the table to stand, \u201cYou can take the shower first.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d Eddie shakes his head, \u201cI can just shower at home.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy would you go home?\u201d Buck scoffs, like the answer is the most obvious thing in the world. There\u2019s a pause Eddie can\u2019t figure out how to fill, and then, \u201cOh shit, did I forget?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI think so,\u201d Eddie supplies.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh well, you free this morning? Like 10 to 12?\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie looks down at his wrinkled clothes, Buck\u2019s blanket, Buck\u2019s smile, \u201cI\u2019m already here.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGreat, cause I have brunch with Maddie.\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie\u2019s brows knit in confusion, \u201cSounds like a you problem.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhich, by association, makes it a you problem too,\u201d Buck shuffles around his kitchen, grabs two mugs, \u201cYou wanna come with me?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWas I invited?\u201d Eddie presses that small detail.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBasically,\u201d Buck hums, sliding a mug across the counter and motioning for Eddie to take it, \u201cI mean Chim said he was coming with her last night so, I assumed that meant I was supposed to bring you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd that\u2019s... too much for before coffee to register. Probably why he doesn\u2019t say anything.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to pick Chris up until 3 so,\u201d Eddie carefully makes his way into the kitchen, his headache pounding and his heartbeat to match, \u201cAs long as it\u2019s okay with Maddie.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cCourse it is,\u201d Buck squeezes Eddie\u2019s arm as he rounds out the kitchen island and starts for his stairs, eager and far too awake for someone who only opened his eyes 10 minutes ago, \u201cI\u2019m gonna go get you some clothes to borrow. Although, fair warning, I don\u2019t own flannel.\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie flips him off and is told there\u2019s Advil in the bathroom.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMaybe, Eddie thinks, in some weird twisted way, he liked having all is friends in his business, teasing his feelings out of him. Because maybe, in some weird convoluted way, that investment and embarrassment was at least tangible proof Eddie wasn\u2019t far off in his hope. That maybe they were right, and he was right, and his best friend was right for him.\n\u00a0\nHe puts his arm around Buck on the couch one day just to see some of that proof.\n\u00a0\nNothing.\n\u00a0\nExcept for Buck snuggling in closer.\n\u00a0\n(But that couldn\u2019t mean anything, right? Surely a look from Hen was better proof than the feeling of Buck\u2019s thigh lined up next to his.)\n\u00a0\nHe sighs in defeat and commits the way Buck\u2019s laugh feels in his ear to memory.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow many times do I have to tell you you\u2019re an idiot before it sticks?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTry again.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah no, didn\u2019t work, sorry.\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie has half the mind to punch him in the face. The longer he wears that smirk the more inviting it seems.\n\u00a0\nBut that stupid (read: handsome) smirk is covered in soot and waiting to cough up a lung, so Eddie\u2019s general care for the wellbeing of the guy wins out, as it always does.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid Cap not tell us to get the hell out of there?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe did,\u201d Buck hums, tries to take the oxygen mask off his face to continue the conversation, but Eddie pushes it back on.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd did I not say, \u2018Hey Buck, the exit\u2019s right here, you behind me?\u2019\u201d Eddie grunts, \u201cAnd did you not say \u2018Yeah Eddie, on your back,\u2019?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI did.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd did I not exit the 2-story condo complex that was about to burn through completely, turn around and find I did not, in fact, have an Evan Buckley on my back?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI believe yeah, yeah that\u2019s what happened,\u201d another cough, Eddie is fuming.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo tell me again why you can\u2019t get it through your thick skull that you, today, were an idiot!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou said today,\u201d Buck\u2019s cheeky grin is unmistakable under the oxygen mask, \u201cWhich means I\u2019m not always an idiot.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh my god, I\u2019d kill you but that would defeat the purpose of this conversation.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI saved a dog, Eddie, I am a kid\u2019s hero right now,\u201d Buck swings his feet off the edge of the ambulance, kicking Eddie\u2019s shins where he stands in front of him, scowling.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not gonna win, am I?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d Buck pulls the mask from his face again, and holds Eddie\u2019s hand down to stop him from pushing it back on, \u201cBut I know I have to be careful. I always am now. I wouldn\u2019t have done it if I wasn\u2019t positive I could get out safely to you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie hates how quickly the words worm their way into his heart, how he says it with such certainty he believes it.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNot gonna let that smug look know it though.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPut your mask back on.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t need it,\u201d Buck waves the small silicone piece past his face.\n\u00a0\n\u201cRules of breathing don\u2019t apply to you now?\u201d Eddie nods down.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s just,\u201d Buck looks up sweetly, under those long lashes, \u201cI\u2019m used to it. Because every time you walk into the room\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t finish that sentence, Buckley.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut it\u2019s true! You leave me breathless!\u201d Buck tries to grab for Eddie\u2019s waist, giggling, like he didn\u2019t just give Eddie a premature heart attack 20 minutes ago.\n\u00a0\nEddie manages to side-step him once before he gives in to his own laughter, lets Buck\u2019s hand find his waist and teasingly pull him forwards. Cap had already lectured him, Buck came out scrape free, the oxygen mask mostly a precaution, and Eddie had seen that little boy reunite with his puppy with his own eyes\u2014viral YouTube video worthy.\n\u00a0\nSo he can\u2019t really be too mad. (Even less so when he steps on Buck\u2019s toes and earns another earful of sweet laughter.)\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I had you worried,\u201d Buck says softly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou should be.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cCan I make it up to you?\u201d the sweetness rolls off Buck\u2019s tongue, convincing, like there was any chance Eddie would say no.\n\u00a0\nHe raises his eyebrows to keep up the pretense anyway.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll buy dinner.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSounds like you could make it up to me,\u201d Eddie smiles, stepping back from Buck briefly when his phone buzzes with a text message. He looks down at it and his smile only grows, \u201cHey, someone saw you on the news. Wants to say hi.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBuck looks up at Eddie confused, as Eddie flips his phone around and crouches to Buck\u2019s sitting eye-level.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWho\u2014 Christopher! Hey buddy!\u201d Buck\u2019s face is immediately overcome with a joy Eddie couldn\u2019t contain if he tried. Carla had texted that Chris saw him and Buck on the news at the scene, and was especially concerned as to the whereabouts of Buck and that puppy he rescued. For all his frustration before, Buck really was fine, and the scene was pretty cleared up, so Eddie told Chris he could get a three-minute FaceTime. He was counting.\n\u00a0\nBuck laughs at something he must have missed Chris saying, and Buck pulls the phone closer to his face, his fingers wrapping around Eddie\u2019s.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy were you looking at the news?\u201d Buck questions, a glint in his eye, \u201cDo I officially trump Sponge-Bob?\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie bounces on his toes where he\u2019s still crouched, bites his lip to keep from laughing when Christopher answers with a simple, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo? Oh man,\u201d Buck dramatically falls out of the frame of the phone, \u201cTell me I\u2019m still above dad.\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie scoffs loudly at that, his mouth agape, and he swivels his head up and around to peek into the corner of the screen, \u201cWatch how you answer that, Chris!\u201d\n\u00a0\nBuck leans in closer to the screen and says something just for Chris, but Eddie hears it, \u201cDad thinks I\u2019m an idiot today so we gotta be nice. Show him your picture.\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie hits Buck\u2019s shoulder, mumbles something about being a terrible influence, then adjusts to see the phone better, his head now practically resting on the tip of Buck\u2019s right shoulder. With all three of them in full view, Chris rushes to pick up an off-white piece of construction paper and hold it close to the screen, but Eddie can still make out the image.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a drawing of a building, some red and orange scribbles Eddie assumes to be fire, and then five people dressed in big black suits and hats standing in the front. The one on the end is holding a puppy.\n\u00a0\nEddie\u2019s emotions are bouncing around his chest, but he manages, \u201cWhat\u2019s this for, buddy?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe had to write about kindness this week at school, and I wrote about you at work,\u201d Chris answers, head peeking out from the side of the picture he\u2019s moved just a little, \u201cSo I drew you and all your friends.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe added the puppy today,\u201d Buck whispers, nudging Eddie.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2014 that\u2019s really awesome, Christopher,\u201d Eddie nods, \u201cCan you make me another one I can bring to work?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI want one too!\u201d Buck yells, and Chris pretends to sulk over the work of making two more drawings, but Eddie can tell the kid is over the moon for the firefighter seal of approval.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTurn the TV off and finish your homework,\u201d Eddie urges, his three minutes edging on four or five.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd clean your room!\u201d Buck adds, helpfully, and Eddie grins at him, \u201cWhat? It sounded like the responsible thing to say.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cLove you, kid,\u201d Eddie waves, and Chris echoes as Buck makes a show of blowing three big kisses right up to the screen, catching Christopher\u2019s laughter up until the second Eddie hangs up.\n\u00a0\nBuck leans back in his seat, oxygen mask long discarded, and smiles.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIn case you ever needed reminding, you are always gonna be that kid\u2019s hero,\u201d Eddie implores, running and hand through Buck\u2019s ashy hair, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to run head first into fire and come out with a dog to prove it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThanks,\u201d he answers quietly.\n\u00a0\nEddie just claps him on the shoulder and moves to stand up, head towards the truck to head back to the station.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to bother you guys, but I just had to say something before you left,\u201d both Eddie and Buck turn at the new voice, and find it coming from a young man perched on the end of the ambulance next to them. He\u2019s in good shape, probably just on the oxygen as a precaution like Buck. He smiles brightly, and continues, \u201cYou two have the most adorable family.\u201d\n\u00a0\nOh. So there\u2019s that.\n\u00a0\nBuck, for the first time since he literally walked through a burning building, suddenly seems like he\u2019s having trouble breathing. His mouth works open and closed, like the words keep dying before they make sound.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Eddie supplies, politely, not seeing the need to correct a survivor of an apartment fire on his misunderstanding. He looked so genuinely in awe of them, and Eddie wonders how much he saw, what it looked like to someone so distant from the truth.\n\u00a0\nThe hope tickles somewhere in his chest again.\n\u00a0\nHe waves to the man and practically scoops Buck up with him, walks them back to the truck a few steps before saying, \u201cI\u2019m sorry if that made you uncomfortable, I just didn\u2019t see the point in arguing\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, no, not at all,\u201d Buck rushes to say on top of him, waving his hands objectively, \u201cIt\u2019s not that, it\u2019s just\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\nJust what?, Eddie\u2019s mind screams for an answer, Just another word, family? Or did something about that feel so right to you too?\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to look like an idiot back there,\u201d Buck says as they walk after a beat of silence, \u201cI\u2019m usually much better at that, I promise.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHold on\u2014 \u201cThat\u2019s happened before?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh yeah, couple of times,\u201d Buck shrugs, \u201cRemember that elf when we took Chris to meet Santa?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cShe said something to you?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, and I hope you don\u2019t mind, I usually just play along. I did then, but now\u2026\u201d Buck\u2019s hands swing at his sides, like they don\u2019t know where they\u2019re supposed to be, \u201cI don\u2019t know, things are different, so I didn\u2019t wanna overstep or anything.\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie thinks for a minute, and he does suppose things have changed a lot in the year since the Santa trip.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot a problem at all,\u201d Eddie shrugs, waving to Cap when they make it in sight of the truck, nodding that Buck\u2019s okay, \u201cI mean, if Chris and abuela had any say in it, you\u2019d have been a legal Diaz for a while now.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe doesn\u2019t have the mental capacity to stop that before it comes out, hyped on adrenaline and compliments and hope.\n\u00a0\nBuck kind of likes the answer though, smiling as saying, \u201cAnd what about you?\u201d Eddie can feel his face heating up, like second-degree scorch levels, \u201cWhat if you had a say?\u201d\n\u00a0\nIn all his grace and eloquence and boyish blush, Eddie says, \u201cGet in the truck, Buckley.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m still buying you dinner,\u201d Buck yells over once shoulder, climbing in before Eddie and chancing a glance back to soak up Eddie\u2019s A-level embarrassing grin, \u201cBut a nice answer to that question and I\u2019d be willing to throw in dessert!\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd if anyone notices the giddy grin Eddie sports the entire drive back, they don\u2019t mention it.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEddie\u2019s just coming up from cleaning duty, washing up the trucks and reorganizing one of the supply closets (doesn\u2019t take a genius to guess who\u2019d had the responsibility just before him.)\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019ll be dinner in a minute, and Eddie\u2019s looking forward to the break. They\u2019ve had an exhausting week, call after call, and today was one of their first slow days in a while. Bobby jumped at the first chance in days to get everyone to properly sit down and eat. No one really had to be asked twice.\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s checked in with Carla and Chris, gotten pictures of his science fair project ranging from the delivery there to the mess deposited on their kitchen table after school, ignored in favor of a celebratory ice cream trip with Carla and abuela. And honestly, whenever his thoughts are on Christopher, the kid takes up about 99% of his concentration points. But he happens to catch a few words of a conversation in the kitchen on his way up the stairs.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou sure, Cap?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou gave me more trouble with that ego of yours back when you first started,\u201d a bundle of laughs, \u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie\u2019s not a serial eavesdropper, he promises, but they\u2019re not being quiet and it\u2019s not eavesdropping if he just happens to hear a casual conversation between friends when he\u2019s walking to the couch.\n\u00a0\nTheir backs are to him, Bobby and Buck, leaning against the kitchen counter, and Eddie can tell by the way Buck\u2019s shoulders are tensed that he\u2019s trying to knot his fingers together in front of him, a nervous tick Eddie\u2019s become attuned to.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know who knows, but it seems like the kind of thing I\u2019d mess up, and I didn\u2019t wanna put you or him or anyone else in a difficult situation if, you know,\u201d Buck shrugs, \u201cSomething ever did come up.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou know, surprisingly, this is one of the things that actually gets to be all about you,\u201d Cap offers, a reassuring nudge to Buck\u2019s shoulders, \u201cYour feelings are what matter here, what you can handle and what you\u2019re comfortable with.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBuck drops his chin, and Eddie almost catches a glimpse from a smile when his head turns to look at Cap, \u201cWeird to hear you say that. Can you go back to mean, over-protective Bobby for a minute?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis is still me being over-protective,\u201d he affirms, though it sounds like he\u2019s smiling too, \u201cI\u2019ve got your back on this, in here and out there, wherever you need me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, Hen told me I could tell you,\u201d Buck sighs, \u201cI wanted to, thought you probably knew, but she just...\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe love you, kid, all of us,\u201d Bobby says warmly, \u201cSome more than others, apparently.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh gross, I regret it already,\u201d Buck squirms away teasingly, and the look Bobby gives him, it guts Eddie, cuts straight through his heart, so open and trusting and loving.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou come out whenever you\u2019re ready, no rush. And other than outdated HR relationship forms for when you do, nothing, and I mean nothing, Buck, has to change.\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie feels his whole face catch fire, and he suddenly feels awful for his eavesdropping casually overhearing this specific and apparently, abundantly personal conversation. He\u2019s been situated on the couch for a while but sinks back further into the cushion in his dread.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThanks, Cap.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe slaps Buck\u2019s shoulders and nods, starting towards the stairs, \u201cTable ain\u2019t gonna set itself, kid.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd Eddie\u2019s never seen Buck that happy about setting the table in all the years he\u2019s known him.\n\u00a0\nBobby has run down the stairs, for what Eddie isn\u2019t sure, only that it leaves Buck free to turn around and catch\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u201cEddie?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey,\u201d and it\u2019s Eddie\u2019s turn to attempt to knot his fingers together.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou hear that?\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie twists his lips, \u201cWhat answer do you want to hear?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBuck chuckles softly, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, that was just... It was just for me to feel better. I\u2019ve been talking to Hen and you know how often I mess up this job and for once I figured, I should get ahead of it while I can,\u201d he huffs.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to explain anything to me, Buck.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know, and I know it\u2019s all still new and changing and I\u2019m the only person in the world who probably panics over shit like this so I didn\u2019t wanna bring you down with it,\u201d Buck paces behind the kitchen counter, and Eddie wants, no needs, to fill that space. He stands and slots himself next to the blonde, offers a hand.\n\u00a0\nHe offers a hand. Buck traces the lines on his palm with delicate fingers.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ve only officially come out to like three people before, and I feel like shit that one of them wasn\u2019t you, because even though like, \u2014 thought I owed it to you anyway but\u2014 I don\u2019t know. And this wasn\u2019t how I wanted to do it either. Thought you had ten more minutes on tire shining.\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie shakes his head, his palm curling under Buck\u2019s gentle touch, \u201cBuck, it\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re not mad?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not mad, not even a little,\u201d Eddie sighs, when it looks like Buck still doesn\u2019t get it, \u201cYou want me to prove it? Like I do with Christopher when he thinks I\u2019m mad at him?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMostly just because I\u2019m intrigued by how you convince an eight-year-old that grumpy face of yours isn\u2019t angry.\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie scoffs, turns his shoulders a little bit towards Buck, who\u2019s still shyly tracing the tiles on the floor with his eyes, \u201cTell me someplace close to here.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cJust do it,\u201d Eddie nudges.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Bucks eyes flit back and forth, like he\u2019s really thinking about it, and a big heavy exhale, \u201cThe bunk room.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay good, the bunk room,\u201d Eddie hums, \u201cCouple hundred steps to get us from there to here, right?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Buck nods.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s how much I could ever be mad at you, a couple hundred steps,\u201d Eddie says lightly, shoulder rising and falling nonchalantly, \u201cAnd if I walked there, and came back to you, I probably wouldn\u2019t even be so mad anymore.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBuck is quiet. He quirks up a brow, \u201cIs that supposed to make me feel better?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou gotta ask why.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe rolls his eyes, but humors him, \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBecause I\u2019d miss you,\u201d he says simply, \u201cThat whole way there and back, I\u2019d wish I was right here.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAm I supposed to ask why again?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI do this with an eight-year-old Buck, asking why is like a primal reflex.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, why would you miss me?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cName someplace really far away,\u201d Eddie leans into Buck\u2019s shoulder, \u201cFarthest place you can think of.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBuck lets out a small laugh, his chin hanging, \u201cJupiter.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDamn that\u2019s a good one,\u201d Eddie nods, \u201cChristopher\u2019s only ever gotten as far as the moon.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBuck laughs, genuinely, and the amount of stupidly obvious feelings he\u2019s about to put on the line are all worth it for that moment alone. Buck doesn\u2019t know the game he plays with Chris, he could get away easily, make something up. But maybe hope is gnawing at him a little too brightly today to not give in, just for the moment.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo imagine all the distance from we are right now, in this kitchen, and all the way to Jupiter,\u201d he steadies himself with a breath, looks directly into Buck\u2019s swimmingly blue eyes, \u201cCan you imagine that?\u201d\n\u00a0\nA slow nod.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s how much I love you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie is sure, if you ask him where he\u2019d do it, it wouldn\u2019t be leaning against the kitchen counter in the loft of the firehouse.\n\u00a0\nBut damn if it isn\u2019t magical.\n\u00a0\nEddie can feel Buck\u2019s sharp intake of breath, can feel the loss of air on his cheek, and the flooding of pink tinge that crowds his features there instead. His eyes don\u2019t move, his hands don\u2019t nervously knot, he just looks at Eddie, and Eddie looks at him, and he\u2019s sure. He\u2019s so sure.\n\u00a0\nAll the space in the world couldn\u2019t amount to how big this is, whatever this is between them.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhen you love someone that much, being mad never wins, no matter what.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cKinda actually wanna ask why for that one.\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie breathes for the first time in a minute, in the form of a laugh, \u201cI could walk to Jupiter and back and still be giving you reasons.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBuck\u2019s first breath is shaky, and suddenly he\u2019s got a hand wiping at the corner of his eye, \u201cShit, Eddie, I\u2019ve got a table to set and you\u2019re making me cry.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWasn\u2019t the intention.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah well, that\u2019s what happens when you\u2019re sappy as fuck,\u201d Buck bounces on his feet, and even though he\u2019s teary, that usual energy that surrounds him and the space he takes up returns, and all feels right in the world.\n\u00a0\nThe sky is blue. The moon is in the sky. Buck is happy. Eddie is in love with him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf it helps, I\u2019ll set the table?\u201d Eddie offers to his bubbling, teary-faced and laughing best friend.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI was gonna make you do that anyway.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou can look at really cute pictures Carla sent me of Chris at the science fair today while I do it?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019ll do it, hand him over,\u201d Buck turns, a smile on his wet and shiny cheeks, \u201cYou wanna bring him over tonight?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you come to ours,\u201d Eddie smiles, already moving to grab plates, \u201cI have a better couch.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow\u2019s your floor?\u201d\n\u00a0\nOh, to be young and stupidly in love. To Jupiter and back.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI told you that you didn\u2019t have to come.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd I told you,\u201d Buck leans over from the passenger seat, \u201cThat I wanted to.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m going grocery shopping, not to the movies,\u201d Eddie turns out of the station parking lot after a shift one day, shopping list in hand and, a very optimistic Buck in tow, \u201cI could still drop you off at home first.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, no, let\u2019s go!\u201d Buck waves him on, like the motion itself will get him to move the car towards their destination, \u201cIt\u2019ll be fun.\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie laughs at the thought, shopping being fun, while he turns on the radio, the car hitting the road.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo, I like spending time with my b\u2014 I like spending time with you, sue me!\u201d Buck clears his throat, but the thought is still received, and makes Eddie\u2019s stomach flip, \u201cDon\u2019t care where we have to do it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe spend all day together.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, but you\u2019re a lot nicer to me out here,\u201d and Buck immediately goes to change the station.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t\u2014\u201d Eddie starts to object when Buck\u2019s fingers hover, but decides to pick his battles, \u201cFine. You can pick the music.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSee?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cJust know if you put any sugar in my shopping cart, we won\u2019t be eating it until you\u2019re there to put Chris to bed after.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDeal,\u201d Buck nods, \u201cStill owe the kid a sleepover anyway.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cBuck\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI got you, I got you!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014 shit!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cLanguage, Edmundo,\u201d Buck inches his face just a breath away from Eddie\u2019s, and whispers, \u201cThere are children here.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, and I\u2019m with the biggest one.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cShut up and hold my hand, you big baby,\u201d Buck swivels on his feet and reaches for Eddie\u2019s hand again, that keeps slipping from his grasp every time they move so much as an inch. \u201cTell me how we repelled down from the side of a cliff today, but this is what does it for you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe all have our fears.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIce skating?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you gonna hold my hand or what?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t have to ask me twice,\u201d Buck slips his fingers between Eddie\u2019s, only has to pry one hand away from its white-knuckled grasp on the wall.\n\u00a0\nEddie considers maybe being afraid of ice-skating for the rest of his life. (Wouldn\u2019t be too much of a stretch, this shit is actually terrifying.)\n\u00a0\nYou\u2019d never be able to tell from the expression on Buck\u2019s face though, as he glides backwards in front of Eddie, hands locked between them, alternating between humming Christmas music and laughing.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna get wrinkles man,\u201d Buck laughs and presses a thumb to the crease between Eddie\u2019s brows, like he could push the worry away, \u201cYou don\u2019t believe I\u2019ll catch you if I fall?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to fall in the first place.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI won\u2019t let it happ\u2014 woah!\u201d Buck stumbles on his feet and Eddie is sure his life prematurely flashes in front of his eyes as they wobble on the outskirts of the rink, but then\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou asshole.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBuck is almost crying he\u2019s laughing so hard, clearly enjoying the joys of messing with Eddie on this, as they skate perfectly again.\n\u00a0\nYou might not even be able to guess Eddie hates this, at the rate he\u2019s shooting heart eyes at the man in front of him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat was mean.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Buck apologizes between laughs, pulls their interlocked hands up to his face and kisses the top of Eddie\u2019s, \u201cThink about the super cute hot chocolate we\u2019re gonna drink when we get home.\n\u00a0\nEddie rolls his eyes as Buck swings to the side and instead, links them, arm in arm and side by side, still clutching Eddie\u2019s hand tight to his chest.\n\u00a0\n\u201cC\u2019mon, with the itty-bitty marshmallows inside,\u201d he practically squeals with delight recounting the purchase he made when he tagged along to go shopping the other day.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf we leave now, you can have all of my itty-bitty marshmallows,\u201d Eddie involuntarily leans into Buck\u2019s shoulder, but the other must take it as a sign of giving in, enjoying it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOne more lap?\u201d He wagers.\n\u00a0\nAnd like Eddie was every gonna say no.\n\u00a0\n(He steals all his marshmallows anyway, leaning over the counter with heir mugs between them, their foreheads pressed together while Buck fishes around Eddie\u2019s drink with a blue plastic spoon, giddy and warm and wonderful.)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEddie has stopped counting all the times people have ignored him and Buck, because frankly it had been driving him insane, and the logic behind wanting to get teased for having a crush on your best friend who probably doesn\u2019t reciprocate never really worked out in his head so. Here we were.\n\u00a0\nTotally not caring that he just walked into work with Buck, wearing his LAFD t-shirt because he spent the night and didn\u2019t wanna wake up early enough to go home to get his own, both holding coffee cups with the same sloppy Diaz order name on the side.\n\u00a0\nNot caring one bit.\n\u00a0\nReally, truly, Eddie could not care less. He barely even thinks about it. Doesn\u2019t think about the fluttery feeling in his chest when he sees Buck holding a cup with his last name like its his own. Doesn\u2019t think about how one smile from Hen would ripple the swarm of fluttering repercussions.\n\u00a0\nBecause it\u2019s not weird, not weird at all, that it feels like he\u2019s getting closer to Buck and the \u2018get a room\u2019 comments have an exponentially opposite correlation.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThanks for the coffee,\u201d Buck presses his hand onto the small of Eddie\u2019s back, tips the cup in a small salute as he passes behind him to the opposite side of the locker room.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThanks for the shirt,\u201d Eddie hums, because he\u2019s thankful, obviously, and not at all to get a reaction.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLooks better on you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIf there was a reaction, Eddie\u2019s too busy with his own.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cTell me again, why we thought this was a good idea?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou thought it was a good idea,\u201d Eddie buckles under the weight of another laughing fit, hands covered in flour in his kitchen and absolutely no good explanation for how it happened (he wasn\u2019t even sure there was flour in this recipe), \u201cI said let\u2019s go to the grocery store and buy mini cupcakes for Chris\u2019s bake sale tomorrow.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think you could be this bad at cooking and baking!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAm I really that bad?\u201d Eddie looks at them, up and down, and Buck\u2019s eyes follow, \u201cYou know what? Don\u2019t answer that.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019d drive you to the store but\u2026\u201d Buck shakes something out of his shirt, sugar or baking powder or one of the other ingredients Eddie didn\u2019t even know he had in his house until tonight.\n\u00a0\n\u201c\u2026But we look terrible.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Buck shrugs, eyes dancing across Eddie\u2019s face, \u201cAll that flour, you\u2019re kind of rocking the gray hair look. Nice to know you\u2019ll age spectacularly, shocking no one.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo you\u2019ll still love me when I\u2019m old and gray?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou know it, baby,\u201d Buck runs a hand through aforementioned gray floury hair before bumping Eddie to the side to check their cupcakes in the oven, \u201cIt looks promising.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t lie.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not!\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie crouches down level with Buck to peek into the cloudy glass front of his oven, and sees half the tray is about to burn over to a crisp and the other few are mysteriously\u2026 bubbling?\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay maybe I lied a little bit,\u201d Buck pinches two fingers together, \u201cBut they\u2019ll be edible?\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie corners him with a look.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll buy some donuts on the way to work for you tomorrow?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBetter answer.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBuck laughs and falls back to sitting on the tile floor of the kitchen, arms slung over his knees, \u201cI didn\u2019t even know bake sales were a real thing. I\u2019d give Chris the $20 for a science museum ticket myself to avoid this.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah well, not every fourth grader has a Buck to spoil them rotten,\u201d Eddie counters, leveraging himself with a hand on the counter to stand up, scrape some cake batter off the handle of the oven.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo you think anyone would prefer to put their money into baking supplies rather than just buy the ticket?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMost parents know how to follow the instructions on a box of cupcake mix,\u201d Eddie smirks, picking up the box and tossing it at Buck\u2019s head.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault you\u2019re so distracting!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m distracting?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I said,\u201d Buck states, leaning forwards to tug on Eddie\u2019s pant leg, pull him back down towards him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one who kept trying to get cake batter on my nose.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWait until we break out the icing,\u201d he grins mischievously, and Eddie feels like maybe he got accidentally placed in the oven too, his face feels so hot, \u201cI think aqua blue funfetti is gonna be your color, Diaz.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat are we gonna ice?\u201d He ignores his sly compliments, tries not to think about the implications too much, \u201cNothing normal is coming out of that oven when it rings in five minutes.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo pessimistic,\u201d Buck knocks on the oven window, \u201cI see one good one already.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe need at least twelve.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThere\u2019s only nine spots in the pan.\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie hangs his head with a dejected sigh, before grabbing a handful of flour and tossing it at Buck on the flour.\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s met with an exasperated gasp, \u201cEddie!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m stressed,\u201d he says, by way of explanation, \u201cIt\u2019s a stress response for me to bother you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you stressed all the time?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI bother you all the time?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cJust about, yeah,\u201d Eddie turns to face Buck, and he doesn\u2019t think you should be allowed to say something like that and smile like Eddie hung the moon for him while he does it.\n\u00a0\nBuck grabs Eddie\u2019s hand and pulls him back down.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSometimes you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOnly sometimes?\u201d Eddie catches himself, a hand on either side of Buck\u2019s hips as he drops laughter into his shoulder.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCan think of a few instances,\u201d Buck nudges him forward, so he can lean back and see all of him, both men still consumed by child-like glee, in a mess of baking ingredients on Eddie\u2019s kitchen floor.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFor instance?\u201d It\u2019s a dangerous game to play along to, his feelings bubbling so close to the surface, like they could spill out all over the place like poorly mixed cupcake batter any second. But he\u2019s looking at him like that, and maybe bad decisions are a stress response too.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSuddenly, I\u2019m coming up blank,\u201d Buck teases, his eyes tracing all over Eddie\u2019s face, he can feel it.\n\u00a0\nEddie hmphs in disagreement, biting his bottom lip.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, you got,\u201d Buck nods, his voice so gentle in the inches between them, \u201cYou got flour on your nose.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t bother you?\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie watches the corner of Buck\u2019s mouth quirk up ever so slightly, then he picks up his hand from where it had been resting on Eddie\u2019s leg, and swipes his thumb gently across Eddie\u2019s nose.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot anymore.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe swears he can hear his heart beat, Buck\u2019s too, the second Buck\u2019s hand comes down and his eyes flit up to his eyes, down to his mouth. They\u2019re so close, Eddie knows he hasn\u2019t imagined it.\n\u00a0\nThe silence in the kitchen is louder than it has ever been, thrumming in Eddie\u2019s ears, clouding all rational thought and urging him, begging him, to give into it.\n\u00a0\nHe feels his breath hitch, feels Buck\u2019s fingers on his chin and it\u2019s so quiet you could hear pain drop.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWould it bother you if I\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\nOr, you could hear the oven timer go off.\n\u00a0\nBuck\u2019s released breath is hot on his face, when they\u2019re both startled out of their trance enough to jump back a foot, look at the cupcakes that are supposedly done.\n\u00a0\nEddie\u2019s glad Buck says something, because he\u2019s lost his voice, \u201cDoes it smell like something\u2019s burning?\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie props himself up on his toes, carefully pulls open the oven door, and is hit with another gust of heat, this time in the form of smoke.\n\u00a0\nThey both cough and sputter away from the door, jumping to their feet, and pushing the smoke in the way.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNow that\u2019s familiar,\u201d Buck laughs lightly, leaning up to open the window behind the sink.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s normal that we\u2019re more comfortable handling dangerous smoke than a box of cake mix,\u201d Eddie surprises himself with his even tone, while Buck, for all his wit Eddie knows he has, seems to be trying to manually push the smoke out the window, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI am not letting the smoke detectors go off so we can have Bobby, or worse, Chim, coming down here to put out my cupcake fire,\u201d Buck continues and with his back turned to him for a moment, Eddie runs a hand down his face.\n\u00a0\nNo smoke detectors go off, no fire departments are called, and every last cupcake ends up in the garbage. But Eddie still feels like something is on fire. For a guy that literally puts out fires for a living, he sure is terrible at smothering whatever has his cheeks still burning up, ablaze under just the memory of Buck\u2019s gentle touch.\n\u00a0\nBuck eats a spoon of blue vanilla frosting and pinky promises Chris and Eddie that he\u2019ll buy something for the bake sale tomorrow morning, dips his pinky in the tub of icing before he does, much to Christopher\u2019s giggling delight.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFor once, Eddie\u2019s thankful for the ignoring.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cHi, I\u2019m here for\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMaddie and Howard?\u201d The nurse smiles fondly at Eddie from her place behind the counter at the station.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLot of visitors?\u201d Eddie chuckles, tucking the pink blanket under his arm.\n\u00a0\n\u201cRotating them through all day,\u201d she passes a visitor sticker across to Eddie.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou must be sick of us.\u201d\n\u00a0\nShe shakes her head lightly, \u201cBest part of my job, knowing that little girl is already so loved.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou have no idea,\u201d he takes the sticker and peels off the back, places it on the corner of his jacket.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThird room down on the left.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he whispers, to keep the happy lull of the delivery floor in tact, before starting down the hallway. When he reaches the door it\u2019s already open, but he knocks very gently twice anyway.\n\u00a0\nA couple sets of eyes spot him immediately.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLook who\u2019s here!\u201d Maddie coos, her smile almost too big to fit on her face, \u201cIt\u2019s your Uncle Eddie!\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie\u2019s got a grin to match at the name.\n\u00a0\nHe waves and whispers a hello, and upon further inspection, sees that Maddie\u2019s empty handed in the bed. He looks over at Chim, who immediately warms at Eddie\u2019s entrance (though Eddie\u2019s willing to bet he hasn\u2019t dropped that giddy smile all day, he remembers the feeling).\n\u00a0\nHe hugs his friend tight, \u201cWelcome to team, Dad.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cStill so weird to hear,\u201d a third voice sounds, \u201cChim\u2019s a dad.\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie finds Buck in a chair next to his sister\u2019s bed, so close to her he could be in the bed with her, smiling down at a little bundle of pink in his arms, even as he teases Chim. Good to know some things never change, no matter what life throws.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNow I know why Buck wasn\u2019t answering my texts on what room you guys were in.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou found us alright,\u201d Buck grins, looking up at Eddie, his knee bouncing lightly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, no thanks to you,\u201d Eddie huffs, but looks back at Chim, hands him the blanket, \u201cFor you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cLittle small for me, Diaz,\u201d Chim jokes, and Maddie yells at him to be nice.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know it\u2019s boring but, its useful,\u201d Eddie points, turning between Maddie and Chim, but adds in a knowing sigh, \u201cChris picked out a fun gift. Insists on delivering it to you personally, though.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, is he coming?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s very very excited to come,\u201d Eddie starts, \u201cWhich is exactly why I did not bring him day one. He\u2019s got a lot of energy and I know from experience that\u2019s the last thing you need today.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cEddie, you\u2019re my hero,\u201d Maddie states, a hand clutched to her chest, \u201cAnd it\u2019s a beautiful blanket. You didn\u2019t need to get us anything though, let alone two gifts.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cCourse I did,\u201d he shoves his now empty hands in his pockets, nudging Chim before stepping slowly over to where Buck sits, the newborn swaddled and perched precariously in his arms.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s just trying to beat me out for best uncle,\u201d Buck whispers to his sister, before looking back down and smiling, \u201cBut we all know who\u2019s gonna win!\u201d\n\u00a0\nChim\u2019s phone rings and he dramatically stalks towards the room\u2019s exit, waving his phone to them, \u201cAlbert\u2019s here. And somehow ended up on the transplant floor.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be waiting!\u201d Maddie waves, as Chim steps out to find his lost brother, and Eddie can hear him already exasperated on the phone. He laughs lightly before crouching down in front of Buck\u2019s chair.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHello there,\u201d Eddie hasn\u2019t had practice with his newborn voice in years, but it comes surprisingly quickly, and fills him up with warmth, \u201cNice to meet you, pretty girl.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGets it from me,\u201d Buck whispers and Eddie shoves him lightly, careful not to move the baby, before reaching a finger out, tickling her tiny feet.\n\u00a0\n\u201cShe\u2019s beautiful, Maddie,\u201d Eddie says, \u201cAnd so good. Christopher cried for the first three hours, I think.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI hate to admit it, but she really likes her Uncle Evan,\u201d she giggles.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSeriously?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMy child is not calling you Uncle Buck,\u201d her voice laced with faux distress, and Eddie assumes they\u2019ve been having this argument for a while. But there\u2019s no bite to it, the siblings gently ribbing at one another while they pass smiles at this precious newborn Buck\u2019s still holding. It makes Eddie\u2019s heart swell\n\u00a0\n\u201cShe can call me whatever she wants.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cEven if it\u2019s Evan?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, even that,\u201d he coos, tucking his nose down a snuggling it over her tiny forehead. Eddie\u2019s still got a finger smoothing out the wrinkles of her little blanket, and there\u2019s not much that could tear his gaze away from her, but Buck is making a pretty strong case.\n\u00a0\nFrom the moment Eddie had walked into the room, Buck was staring at his new niece with such a strong sense of awe and wonder, seemingly mesmerized by her tiny fingers and her little puffs of breath. He\u2019s so attentive to her, even just a couple hours old, holding her gently, bouncing her softly on his knee and whispering to her every few minutes, like they\u2019re in their own little world.\n\u00a0\nThere isn\u2019t a word strong enough for Eddie to describe the feeling, how endeared he is to the scene. It pulls at something Eddie hasn\u2019t thought about in a while, melts him and pulls him up solid again all at once.\n\u00a0\nIt should be illegal to ever see the person you\u2019re hopelessly in love with holding a baby.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s like asking to go into cardiac arrest.\n\u00a0\nBuck must catch Eddie staring at some point, knocks his toes into the tip of his with a soft, \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNothing, nothing,\u201d Eddie waves, because that\u2019ll really prove it\u2019s nothing, when its really everything, \u201cJust happy.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah?\u201d It\u2019s such a genuine question, Buck\u2019s eyes pouring into his, Eddie has to bite the inside of his cheek to keep from blurting something stupid and blowing his cover, or worse, waking the baby.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Eddie nods, letting the little girl hold onto his finger, \u201cNot surprising in the slightest that you\u2019re just as good with kids eight hours old as you are with the eight-year-old ones.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cLot easier when they\u2019re both so cute,\u201d Buck hums, and Eddie feels his gaze drift to where the newborn holds Eddie\u2019s finger, \u201cLooks pretty good on you too.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh my god, I\u2019m sick of these hormones,\u201d Maddie laughs from the bed, wiping at a few tear tracks falling from her eyes.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMaddie, no,\u201d Buck warns, \u201cBecause if you start, then I\u2019ll start\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can\u2019t, Evan, it\u2019s just so,\u201d she hiccups in her happy-tear laughter, \u201cYou\u2019re perfect and she\u2019s so perfect and I\u2019m so happy!\u201d She reaches forward and squeezes Eddie\u2019s cheeks adoringly, like he\u2019s her baby brother too.\n\u00a0\nAnd Eddie thinks, he wouldn\u2019t mind, to be a part of this little family, in any way. Would choose it, in a heartbeat.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI keep losing my phone\u2026\u201d she pats around her bed and blankets, head twisting as she searches.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat do you need your phone for?\u201d Buck asks, and tacks on with signature Buckley wit, \u201cEveryone important is here.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cChim\u2019s not here,\u201d Eddie whispers.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, but we know where he is,\u201d he counters.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI wanna take a picture,\u201d she clarifies, lifting up her blanket, and then\u2014 \u201cOh, got it! The three of you,\u201d she waves them together, like she\u2019s orchestrating, \u201cSmile!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cCan she smile yet?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOf course she can smile,\u201d Maddie scoffs, scrolls on her phone as she dismisses her brother, and Eddie tries to object.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh I don\u2019t\u2014 It should just be\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSit down and get in the picture, Eddie,\u201d Maddie says, \u201cOr I could make you guys Uncles Evan and Edmundo.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, she went to the full name?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cShe went to the full name,\u201d Buck laughs as Eddie repositions himself, an arm around Buck\u2019s chair and a finger still clutched in the girl\u2019s grasp.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe has books in the bag that he\u2019s supposed to be reading for school, but I made him finish all his other homework before we came. I put 20 bucks in the front pocket for pizza and washable markers, because he kept asking if he could draw pictures with you?\u201d Eddie shakes his head furiously, a confused look etched on his face that translates to the fact that he just wasn\u2019t gonna fight it anymore, \u201cOh and he\u2019ll probably try to stay up all night to impress you, but he\u2019s gonna pass out at like, 9, so, I put pajamas in there too.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAye, aye, captain,\u201d Buck salutes, one arm perched on the doorframe, \u201cWill that be all?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes,\u201d Eddie nods, turning to leave before he\u2019s late, but then\u2014 \u201cNo, actually. Thank you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot necessary, would do it even if you didn\u2019t need me to,\u201d Buck smiles, \u201cYou know I love hanging out with him.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cStill, thank you,\u201d Eddie looks down at his watch, he\u2019s got a half hour to get top Chris\u2019s school on time for his parent-teacher conferences at 7 (the stress of scheduling that feeling like months ago.)\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou clean up pretty nice for a school night, Diaz.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cShut up.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI mean it,\u201d Buck reaches out, pulls at the collar of Eddie\u2019s dress shirt, his fingers splayed across his shoulder, \u201cYou should get dressed up more often.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll remember a tie next time we have pizza and beers on your couch.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t object,\u201d Buck winks, and he\u2019s making it so hard to leave, that stupidly charming boyish smile, his hands still on him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI have to go,\u201d Eddie pouts, but makes no move to leave.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019ll behave, I promise.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cPinky?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBuck holds up a fist, his pinky out towards Eddie.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, okay, I fucking hate conferences, man,\u201d Eddie shakes his head, turns back towards Buck\u2019s apartment floor hallway, \u201cIf they say anything bad about Chris, he\u2019s your kid, fair warning.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSounds good to me,\u201d and Eddie can hear the smile on Buck when he says it, lets it follow him all the way down the hall, until he hears the door shut and the elevator ding its arrival.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s pretty late by the time Eddie has finished seeing every teacher he had to meet with, fought his way out of several PTA pitches and uncomfortably awkward conversations with parents Eddie\u2019s never seen before, so Buck\u2019s texted him that he left a spare key at the front desk to pick up so he could let himself in whenever he got home.\n\u00a0\nHome.\n\u00a0\n\u201cEvan\u2019s partner?\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie is startled by how quickly he\u2019s recognized by the man working at the lobby desk, but nods anyway.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot about you, seen pictures too,\u201d the older man smiles, slowly turning to unlock a large gray case on the wall behind him with the spare keys, then winks, \u201cAll good things.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, I\u2019d hope so,\u201d Eddie laughs lightly, nervously shoving his hands into his pockets, \u201cThough I apologize, that you get stuck with him talking your ear off.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMakes my day,\u201d the man says, swinging the case door shut, \u201cMy husband is just like him. Never shuts up.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIt makes Eddie laugh again, as he takes the key from the counter, ignoring the way the parallel tugs at his heart.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou have a good night, Mr\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDiaz, Eddie Diaz,\u201d Eddie reaches a hand out to shake, and the old man takes it with such a bright smile.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNice to finally meet you Eddie, you have a wonderful night.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he waves, as he steps over to the elevator.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a quick trip up, so he doesn\u2019t have too much time to dwell on the conversation, the implications of it and how Evan\u2019s partner probably didn\u2019t mean work partner, or how Eddie didn\u2019t bother to correct it.\n\u00a0\nHope flickers again.\n\u00a0\nBefore he realizes it, he\u2019s unlocking Buck\u2019s door stealthily, seeing the kitchen and living room lights are turned off, and the apartment is quiet. He locks up, tosses his keys on the counter, hangs his jacket on an open hook and kicks off his shoes. It\u2019s so wonderfully domestic, Eddie\u2019s embarrassed the pattern makes him smile so wide. He tries to cover it up with a shake, get it out of his system, before he tip-toes further into the apartment.\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s about to go up the stairs, assuming with the lights out they were asleep, when he hears one very familiar giggle come from the living room, behind Buck\u2019s couch.\n\u00a0\nIf Buck and Chris know he\u2019s home, they make no indication of it when he reaches the end of the room, arms crossed and leaning on a beam on the edge.\n\u00a0\nThey\u2019re both laying down on their backs, heads closest to where Eddie stands behind them and feet stretched towards the window. They\u2019re whispering to each other, troublemakers they always are when they team up together.\n\u00a0\nHis heart clenches at the sight just as he sees his son point up at the ceiling, Buck\u2019s gaze seeming to follow it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGot a name for that one, Buddy?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s abuela\u2019s star.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cPerfect choice,\u201d Eddie hears Buck say, like he\u2019s committing it to memory.\n\u00a0\nEddie peeks up to get a look at whatever they\u2019re looking at and he sees it, stars, all over Buck\u2019s living room ceiling. There\u2019re little green neon plastic stars stuck all over the place, lighting up in the dark of the apartment.\n\u00a0\nEddie suddenly remembers a car ride one day, not too long ago, Chris in the back and Buck in the passenger seat on his right, when they were coming home from dinner. Chris had asked them why they couldn\u2019t see the stars in the sky here, but they could in Texas. He remembers rattling off some answer, good enough, it satisfied Chris, but Buck had looked so heartbroken. Eddie teased him, said he could spoil his kid all he wanted, but he\u2019d have to draw the line and literally putting the stars in the sky.\n\u00a0\nBut hell if he didn\u2019t do it. Hang the stars in the sky for him.\n\u00a0\nHoly shit, this man.\n\u00a0\nEddie\u2019s choking back something grossly emotional while he lets them continue, gazes on in wonder and adoration.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo we have the Big Dipper?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHmmm,\u201d Buck pretends to ponder the thought loudly, \u201cYou know, our galaxy is a little different than the Milky Way.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, right.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut you know what we do have?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cA Little Dipper!\u201d And suddenly Buck curls on his side, and tickles his fingers all over Chris, who squirms in gleeful protest.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m the Little Dipper.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou are, my man,\u201d Buck hums, their laughter only slightly petering out while his tickle attack ceases, \u201cWhere\u2019s your star gonna go?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cRight\u2026\u201d Chris points around for ammonite, then stops, \u201cThere.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cRight next to the TV, closest to the video games,\u201d Buck smiles, \u201cSmart kid.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou want your star to be next to mine?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBuck gasps, like he\u2019s literally just won the lottery, \u201cReally?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, really,\u201d Chris beams at the prospect of making Buck that happy.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell okay then, if you say so,\u201d Buck points up happily, \u201cThat one?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Buck starts softly, \u201cWe gotta give your dad a star before he gets home. We can name it the Grumpy Dipper.\u201d\n\u00a0\nChristopher\u2019s laugh floats and bounces off the walls.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, okay fine,\u201d Buck concedes, \u201cDad. Where we putting him?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNext to you,\u201d Christopher states simply, as if the answer were obvious.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Buck agrees, like maybe it was.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo you\u2019ll stay next to daddy forever.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIt wasn\u2019t a question, but Eddie can see Buck roll his head to the side, and take a big deep breath, looking at Christopher, \u201cYeah kid, forever.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDaddy says he loves me to the moon. I think I love you to the moon too.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo way! That\u2019s a lot,\u201d Buck pretends to marvel at the distance, stretching his arms out wide like he can hold the space himself, making Chris giggle at his side, \u201cDo you know how much I love you?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow much?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cStars and back.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lot too.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSure is.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow much do you love dad?\u201d Christopher asks quietly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow much do I love your dad...\u201d he says it so gently Eddie almost misses it, stills his breathing, wants to lean in close and hug the moment to his chest but is so afraid to break the magic that he stays still.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s quiet for a moment, as Buck thinks, then says, \u201cWhat\u2019s the farthest place you can think of?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s what dad asks me, Buck!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m borrowing it!\u201d he laughs, ruffles a hand through Chris\u2019s curls.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe moon, I think.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cChristopher, I\u2019d love your dad even if I was stuck all the way on the moon.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cReally?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, doesn\u2019t matter how far I have to go,\u201d Buck whispers, \u201cI\u2019d love him the whole way.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re not on the moon though.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, me too,\u201d Buck kisses the top of Chris\u2019s head, \u201cKinda like it here.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re unbelievable.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThey\u2019re from the dollar store.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou hung stars on your very expensive loft apartment ceiling so my kid could stargaze.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThey\u2019re stickers, I could take them down tomorrow if I wanted.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut you\u2019re not going to.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t you wanna stargaze with us?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIn the morning?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSleep over again. I have it on good authority the floor\u2019s pretty comfortable.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMy eight-year-old gets your king-sized bed and I\u2019m on the floor?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe loves me to the moon, Eddie!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd I love you to Jupiter, your point?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn hindsight, it should have happened a lot sooner. But Eddie\u2019s grateful to whatever powers that may be that pushed it back at least 20 minutes.\n\u00a0\nThey\u2019re doing clean up on a call, no major injuries, just a down power line, a tree, and a car that\u2019s seen better days. The call itself was generally stress-free, but it came at the end of a long week of long shifts, and everyone was reaching the end of their patience.\n\u00a0\nEddie is working with Buck, Hen, and Chim to clean up some glass from the broken car windows on one side of the street when he sees an older woman approach Buck.\n\u00a0\n\u201cExcuse me, are you the medic?\u201d she asks, brows knitted in worry.\n\u00a0\nBuck looks around to check she\u2019s actually talking to him, and shrugs, his jacket bouncing on his shoulders.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI was walking my dog by the tree that went down, I\u2019m fine but one of the officers told me to find the medic to get checked over anyway,\u201d the woman clarifies, \u201cTall young firefighter, I think she said? Brown hair?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re looking for my partner, Eddie,\u201d Buck sighs in understanding, and points over to Eddie. He waves, with a small smile. Buck leans over to the woman and pretends to hide his next comment behind his hand, a glint in his eyes, \u201cBut don\u2019t let his good looks fool you, he\u2019s actually an old man.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBoth plenty younger than me!\u201d the woman laughs again.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, since you\u2019re here and looking fantastic,\u201d Buck slicks on the charm, kiss ass, \u201cI can walk you over to the ambulance, check you out and get you cleared to go.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, aren\u2019t you a sweet thing,\u201d she croons as Buck makes a show of extending his arm out to her for a proper escort, she turns back and smiles at Eddie sheepishly, \u201cSorry, I might steal him from you!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou keep him!\u201d Eddie waves, but from the look on Buck\u2019s face when he says it, you\u2019d think it sounded more like I love you.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey\u2019re starting to walk away, leaving the three of them smiling, but Eddie happens to catch the tip of their conversation, \u201cHow long have you and your partner been together?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBuck grins at the conversation topic, practically skips across the street in answer, \u201cAlmost a month technically, but feels longer.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s how you know he\u2019s a keeper,\u201d the woman pats a hand on Buck\u2019s bicep, \u201cI won\u2019t actually steal him from you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe sight is sickeningly sweet to watch, Buck with the sweetest woman on his arm gushing about their love lives and the weather and rainbows probably, it\u2019s that good.\n\u00a0\nBut all Eddie hears is white noise.\n\u00a0\n\u201cKid is stealing our jobs,\u201d Chim laments, sweeping up another pile of glass.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s got moves, I\u2019ll give him that,\u201d Hen chuckles, and glances over at Eddie for his comment, and finds him frozen in place, \u201cYou good, Eddie?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe chokes something out like, \u201cWhy\u2019d Buck say we\u2019ve been together a month?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDamn, has it been a month already?\u201d Chim whistles.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut we\u2019ve been working together for 2 years.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t think that\u2019s what she meant, Eddie,\u201d Hen laughs lightly, but Eddie stays frozen. Slightly worried, she tacks on a half-serious, \u201cHow long you\u2019ve been together. Dating.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut me and Buck aren\u2019t dating.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, and I didn\u2019t have a kid with Maddie,\u201d Chim rolls his eyes, and Hen joins in with laughter, \u201cHen, are you not married to Karen either?\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd it should feel nice. Eddie\u2019s literally run through hour long tangents in his mind on why the world was worse off when his friends weren\u2019t teasing him about his feelings for his partner.\n\u00a0\nBut something about this time feels different.\n\u00a0\nHen must catch on to it too.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh shit, you\u2019re serious?\u201d Hen sputters, then slaps at Chim\u2019s shoulder, \u201cChim, I think he\u2019s being serious.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo way, we were all there when Buck asked you out!\u201d Chim yelps, and Eddie could do a spit take, a really good one, like slo-mo and sound effects and all, \u201cI mean, not there there, but, Hen and I practically pushed him down the stairs to do it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Eddie\u2019s voice doesn\u2019t even feel like his own, \u201cBuck\u2019s never asked me out.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou guys went to dinner! Right?\u201d Hen is trying to explain, and Chim is nodding furiously along with her, \u201cYou\u2019re like, really being serious about this Eddie? Because if you are, Buck really thinks\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you being serious?\u201d Eddie balks at the concept, because there\u2019s no way, it couldn\u2019t be, he\u2019s not\u2014\n\u00a0\nHe hasn\u2019t been dating Buck for a month without knowing.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI swear,\u201d Hen says, \u201cEddie, you know we like to make fun\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cExactly! You guys are always going on about \u2018when\u2019s the wedding?\u2019 or \u2018get a room\u2019 and making those eyes,\u201d and Eddie can\u2019t get his thoughts to just focus for a minute, \u201cAnd then you just stopped!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as fun when it\u2019s true!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s not true, though,\u201d Eddie feels like he\u2019s just run a marathon.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo wait, I don\u2019t know what Chim\u2019s reason was, but I stopped because I was being respectful of a very new relationship,\u201d Hen warns with a glace sideways, \u201cWe were so happy for you two idiots!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\nHey, don\u2019t thank us, we didn\u2019t do anything. Just really happy for you. You deserve it.\n\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not dating Buck,\u201d Eddie keeps his resolve, because in the catastrophic mess that is his life it\u2019s one of the only things he knows, clings to the prospect of changing, \u201cI want to be dating Buck, but I know I\u2019m not. Because he doesn\u2019t\u2014 it\u2019s not\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe asked you out!\u201d Chim almost knocks over their bucket of collected glass, and Eddie is again grateful this conversation waited until the very end of a call, \u201cMultiple times. You kept going on dates. Believe me, I\u2019d know.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\nOh that\u2019s right, you had your dinner last night, Maddie mentioned it. You have a nice night?\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think I\u2019d know?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe whole world knew! Of course we thought you knew.\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie\u2019s suddenly on his feet, pacing, trying to get into some sort of rhythm that makes the world feeling it\u2019s spinning on its axis again.\n\u00a0\n\nDid you know Buck was seeing someone?\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWas I not supposed to?\n\n\u00a0\nThis has to be the most cosmically cruel joke the universe has ever played on someone. The world\u2019s most elaborately played prank. A lifetime of karma. Something. Anything. That\u2019s the only thing that could make sense.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBuck!\u201d Eddie searches for a reprieve, some kind of normalcy, Buck is his best friend, this much he knows, \u201cBuck, can you tell Hen and Chim that we aren\u2019t dating? Please.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBuck stumbles back the last few steps, his energy dropping with his smile, as he sides up next to Chim. He looks blankly at Eddie, \u201cAre you breaking up with me?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSomeone mutters a holy shit.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBecause we\u2019re on a call?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBecause we\u2019re not dating.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBuck sputters at the phrase, gestures wildly between Hen and Chim for help they cannot offer him. Eddie watches his chest rise and fall, rise and fall.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re not joking? Because you\u2019ve joked about this before, so I just wanna\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy would I joke about this?\u201d Eddie isn\u2019t sure he can keep his voice level for much longer, a flurry of emotions Eddie can\u2019t pinpoint raging inside him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe girl after the bus crash, I said I was taken and you said\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\nDidn\u2019t know you were seeing someone.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI said I\u2019d cook you a fancy dinner and you were like\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\nIs it my birthday or something that I\u2019m missing?\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI brought you to couples brunch with Maddie and Chim, and you thought\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\nSounds like a you problem.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nHoly shit. Holy shit. He\u2019d been friend-zoning his boyfriend.\n\u00a0\nEddie lets out a shaky breath, because what the actual fuck, man, \u201cYou\u2019ve never called me your boyfriend.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think you liked labels!\u201d Buck defends, his emotions reading wildly across his features, his gestures, his pacing, unlike Eddie who has yet to move, \u201cYou haven\u2019t really dated since I\u2019ve known you and I didn\u2019t wanna make you uncomfortable.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow come I\u2019ve never taken you on a date?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou have!\u201d Buck all but yells, and Eddie\u2019s so thankful the scene is cleared, \u201cYou buy me dinner and drive me to work and I\u2014 I\u2019ve stayed over at your house.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOn the couch, Buck!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI was being respectful.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd goddammit Eddie never thought common courtesy could be so mindlessly infuriating.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been dating a month, right?\u201d Eddie counters, searching for some reasoning here, \u201cAnd we\u2019ve never kissed?\u201d\n\u00a0\n(Didn\u2019t need to know that, Chim whispers, somewhere.)\n\u00a0\n\u201cWas I supposed to spring it on you without your consent?\u201d And Eddie sees it, the tensed shoulders, the fingers he\u2019s knotting together, like stressed-out clockwork, and he wants to run over and hold his hands, let him trace the lines on his palms and breathe, \u201cEddie, I was doing everything in my power not to fuck this up. I\u2019d wait a year to kiss you if I had to. I already waited two!\u201d\n\u00a0\nHold on\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u201cI thought we were gonna kiss the other night, in your kitchen, but we didn\u2019t and it was fine,\u201d Buck shakes his head, \u201cI didn\u2019t even know you were interested until I went to ask you out that morning after you\u2014 shit.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBuck, you okay?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe gym, you were working out,\u201d Eddie watches as Buck takes a few steps back, his voice low, his words calculated, \u201cYou were waiting for a text from abuela about parent-teacher conferences, and you said\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\nFinally.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nEddie doesn\u2019t think there\u2019s any air left in his lungs. His mind reels, the pieces fall into place, but Eddie\u2019s chest is tight and unmoving.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPolice got the rest of the scene covered, we\u2019re good to go,\u201d Bobby is the first once to break the trance the four of them have sunk into when he approaches, after what to Eddie feels like hours of silence, of knowing, of wanting. He must feel the tension immediately and offers a wary, \u201cEverything okay here?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cJust fine, Cap,\u201d Eddie is surprised that Buck is the first one to speak, bouncing on his toes and turning to run away quickly, \u201cMind if I ride in the ambulance?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBuck\u2014\u201d Eddie takes his first step forward.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThere\u2019s a woman I was helping before,\u201d Buck\u2019s eyes are trained only on Bobby as he explains, \u201cJust wanna make sure she\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe can take my spot,\u201d Hen offers up easily enough when Bobby doesn\u2019t answer, obviously sensing there\u2019s more to this than Buck just being a good person.\n\u00a0\nChim follows along without missing a beat, swiftly clapping a strong and reassuring arm around Buck\u2019s shoulders, \u201cC\u2019mon Buckaroo. I\u2019ll let you press the sirens.\u201d Eddie\u2019s glad that earns them a weak smile from Buck.\n\u00a0\nBobby still doesn\u2019t seem satisfied, but nods Hen and Eddie along anyway, and they start towards the truck. Eddie doesn\u2019t even feel like its his own body taking the steps, making the movements, climbing into the seat next to Hen, watching her shut the door.\n\u00a0\nHe does hear something Buck says to Bobby just before he\u2019s inside though.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTold you I\u2019d mess it up.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo here\u2019s how it happened:\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019d been trying to get him to do it for months, I\u2019m not really sure what about that specific day made him finally cave, but, Chim\u2019s right. We practically pushed him down the stairs to do it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMonths?\u201d It\u2019s all Eddie can stick to. Buck had said two years, two years he\u2019d waited\u2014wanted\u2014 to kiss him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe only picked Buck to wingman instead of you because once Buck gets an idea in his head he goes all out with it. We knew he\u2019d do it, and we knew you\u2019d say yes to him,\u201d Hen offers a supportive smile, \u201cAnd you did, you just\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHad no idea,\u201d Eddie finishes.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBuck has that day practically memorized, you made him so happy,\u201d Hen sighs, \u201cI generally did more of the coaching, Chim was mostly a counteractive nagging big brother type of thing. But he recited the whole conversation word for word to us.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI had headphones in,\u201d Eddie explains, \u201cI was listening to music, and I was waiting for abuela to text me, and I was so distracted. I mean, I heard him ask me to get dinner, but we do that all the time! I\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n(He later finds out he missed half of the sentence, do you wanna get dinner, as like, a date, just the two of us.)\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI thought he was asking me what time I got the conference.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Tuesday seven pm slot. Thursday at seven. Their date. That was their date, that was\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u201cI brought my son to our first date.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThere\u2019s a beat of silence in the truck, where Hen sits across from him, and then.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she\u2019s sputtering, a hand covering her mouth to shield her laughter, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s not funny.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBut eventually Eddie catches a case of the giggles too, throws his head back and laughs brightly, \u201cIt\u2019s pretty funny.\u201d It\u2019s calming, in a way, to give into the lunacy of the whole thing just for a minute, alone in the ladder truck with a friend.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut he really liked it,\u201d Hen says, when their laughter has mostly subsided, \u201cYou should have seen how he came barreling into me the next day, talking about his cooking and your movie night and Chris and his flowers.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHeard that was your idea.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThought it would make it seem more like a date,\u201d Hen shrugs, \u201cHe\u2019s got good intentions but, he could\u2019ve used the nudge in the right direction.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m so stupid.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s easier to backtrack now, his mind a little clearer, and catch all the things he missed. All the signs, the looks, the coincidences. The whole time he was looking for them from his friends, his coworkers, their teasing as proof that he had hope, when he should have been looking at Buck. Buck, bless his heart, had been giving him all the signs, the coincidences, the touches and the laughs and the looks. He\u2019d given him everything. And Eddie had chocked it all up to hopeless romanticism.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, no you\u2019re not,\u201d Hen places a reassuring hand on Eddie\u2019s knee, \u201cAnd besides, it shouldn\u2019t matter now. We all heard you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nI want to be dating Buck.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLike he\u2019s ever going to talk to me again,\u201d Eddie huffs, \u201cI\u2019d never talk to me again.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not gonna lie, he might distance himself for a bit,\u201d Hen says to Eddie\u2019s downcast expression, \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t matter how far he gets. That boy loves you. And when you love someone like that, you always come back.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\nDoesn\u2019t matter how far I have to go, I\u2019d love him the whole way.\n\n\u00a0\nFor the first time in a while, Eddie clings to something other than unfounded hope.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHen is right. Not that Eddie ever expected her to be wrong. In anything, but especially this.\n\u00a0\nBuck returns in the ambulance with Chim about an hour after Eddie\u2019s been in the station, sitting on the bench by the punching bag, waiting, a seat open, just in case.\n\u00a0\nHe runs right past him and up to the loft, yelling some wild story Eddie would love to hear.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEddie doesn\u2019t get much time to dwell on it all, even though he knows he\u2019d just work his mind over in circles, running laps of what ifs and why nots and how\u2019d I miss this.\n\u00a0\nHe goes home after that shift and is asleep almost instantly, can\u2019t remember a single dream he had when he wakes up the next morning, rushing around at the last minute in his usual style. He gets Chris out the door with a bag of cereal and a wrinkled shirt and his body barely awake by the time he drops him off at school. It hits him suddenly, that he hasn\u2019t been alone in his car in a while. Buck had been in the passenger seat more often than not, changing the radio, playing games with Chris, sneaking his hand across the center console to gently touch Eddie in all his glorious tactile affection Eddie had mistaken for really good friendship. (Hen had had another good laugh at that one in the truck yesterday.)\n\u00a0\nWhen he gets to work, he tries to separate himself from it, because he knows the last thing he needs is for this to affect his work, his job. He\u2019d overheard Buck having that conversation with Bobby in the kitchen, how as long as it didn\u2019t, nothing had to change.\n\u00a0\nHe climbs up the stars two at a time, eager for what, Eddie isn\u2019t sure, but finds Chim and Hen leaning against the kitchen counter, light conversation flowing over their mugs of warm coffee.\n\u00a0\nBobby tells Eddie that Buck called out sick.\n\u00a0\nAnd it\u2019s a lie for him, Eddie knows.\n\u00a0\nHe apologizes to Bobby and he brushes him off, says he doesn\u2019t know why he\u2019s apologizing. But he squeezes his shoulder before leaving and Eddie knows that he knows.\n\u00a0\nThe shift is not particularly bad, none of the calls even venture into the realm of it, but everything\u2019s worse today. Just is. The 118 is gentle with him for it, and he doesn\u2019t know why, since he\u2019s clearly the bad guy here.\n\u00a0\nHe jumps down the steps two at a time to leave.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cChris, Carla?\u201d Eddie drops his bag off by the front door, barely mustering up the energy to kick his shoes off with it, \u201cI\u2019m home.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJudging by the time, he knows dinner must be over, Chris\u2019s homework finished, kid might have even showered and got his pajamas on. On a normal day, he\u2019d jump into the room and pick up wherever Carla let off, keeping a routine in place, but after the day he\u2019s had, Eddie has no qualms about scooping his son up and hugging him tight for the whole five minutes he knows he\u2019d let him (you\u2019re tickling me, dad!) and huddling up on the couch, watching movies and eating ice cream and sleeping in late on Saturday morning.\n\u00a0\nThe universe, in all its cruel jokes, has other plans.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDad!\u201d Eddie is immediately brightened by a small pair of arms wrapping around his legs, runs a hand through the curly hair nestles into his stomach.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey kid, you have a good day?\u201d He feels the gentle pressure of a nod, \u201cWhere\u2019s Carla?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cShe had a stomach ache,\u201d he answers, simply.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh,\u201d Eddie nods, keeping the confusion out of his voice, \u201cIs she\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cChris, I cannot find your Superman blanket, we\u2019re gonna have to use\u2014\u201d Eddie looks up, finds none other than Buck walking out of the bedroom hallway, holding a bright blue blanket to his chest.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBuck?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cChris, why don\u2019t you go get this set up on the couch,\u201d Buck looks anywhere but Eddie, leans forward and tosses the blanket to Chris, \u201cPick a movie your dad would like.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBuck\u2026\u201d Eddie starts again, not sure how he\u2019d finish the thought.\n\u00a0\nHis son saves him the trouble though, as he runs off, high-fiving Buck as he passes.\n\u00a0\nBuck rubs a hand nervously at the back of his neck, and says softly once Christopher is safely far away and in the living room, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I uh, I meant to text you, it just\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Eddie rushes to say, for him to know. It\u2019s okay, all if it, every last thing.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSomething came up, Carla had a doctor\u2019s appointment, or something, and apparently,\u201d Buck lets out a wheeze of a strained laugh, \u201cI\u2019m next in line on the school\u2019s guardian roster.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019d do it in a heartbeat, Eddie, no questions asked, you know that,\u201d Buck drops his arm, pushes his hands into his pockets instead, \u201cAlways liked Chris better than you anyway.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd Eddie laughs. Buck does too.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you feeling better?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBuck arches an eyebrow.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBobby told me you were sick,\u201d Eddie clarifies, \u201cYou feeling better?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThey both know that\u2019s not what he\u2019s really asking about, but Buck answers anyway.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, false alarm, I think,\u201d he clears his throat, \u201cBut lucky, so I could be here.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cCourse,\u201d Buck shrugs, \u201cDo you think you could come up with some reason for why I had to leave?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBuck\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m fine, it\u2019s just, I have to leave,\u201d he crosses the space they\u2019re standing, squeezes through the small opening next to Eddie to get to the front door, so careful not to touch him, like he could set the whole place on fire if he did, \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want Chris to think I\u2019m leaving just, that\u2014 that I have to leave.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe wants to fight it. He wants Buck to stand there and say he is leaving, he wants Buck to yell at him, and hate him for all the stupid signs he misread, how he humiliated them in front of their friends on a call, how this has ruined every bit of their friendship.\n\u00a0\nEddie is searching for a reaction.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can do that,\u201d his voice is so low, and gravelly, like he could cry at any moment.\n\u00a0\nBuck nods, swallows slowly, turns for the door again, and Eddie wants to stop him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid you really not know?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe sudden question stuns Eddie into another bout of silence.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe whole time, everything I did, did you really not know?\u201d Buck isn\u2019t looking at Eddie yet, but he can tell his eyes are glassed over, and his fingers, twisting knots.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Buck. All the dates\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, not\u2014 not that there were dates,\u201d Buck shakes his head, takes a steady breath, \u201cDid you really not know how much I cared about you?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe wants to scream no, he didn\u2019t know, but he hoped, he hoped through every smile and gentle touch, every car ride and teasing flirt, every late night and early morning, he hoped that the intention behind them meant even half of what Eddie wanted them to.\n\u00a0\nHe doesn\u2019t say anything though. Because as much as he craves a reaction, he\u2019s so scared. That he fucked the whole thing up. That they cannot come back from it, despite anyone\u2019s reassurances otherwise.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, Eddie,\u201d is all Buck says, when the silence stretches too long, \u201cClosest place you can think of?\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie chokes out something between a laugh and a sob.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFront door.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBuck nods, his lips half pursed in a smile, \u201cNight, Eddie.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nChris, obviously, asks where Buck\u2019s gone the minute Eddie throws himself on the couch. Eddie hadn\u2019t come up with a single good answer.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re hogging the blanket,\u201d is all Eddie grumbles, pulling Chris\u2019s small blue blanket up over his knees, sinking into the couch cushions. Eddie hadn\u2019t had many relationship ships in his life, few with proper \u2018break-ups\u2019. He assumes this is what one feels like. He wants ice cream.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat movie did you pick?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWaited for you and Buck to come back,\u201d Christopher tosses the remote into his father\u2019s lap.\n\u00a0\nAnd well shit, here goes nothing, \u201cBuddy, Buck had to go home.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh,\u201d Chris exclaims, \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBecause\u2026\u201d Eddie searches for answers in whatever cartoon in playing on the TV screen, his eyes not daring to look at the puppy dog pout he knows Chris will be wearing, \u201cBecause we had a little fight.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGrown up stuff,\u201d he ruffles his son\u2019s hair, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay to be sad, Dad. You said so,\u201d Chris offers, snuggling in closer to Eddie\u2019s side, like he knows that\u2019s what he needed, \u201cBut Buck didn\u2019t seem sad today.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBecause he didn\u2019t want you to be sad, kid.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy would I be sad?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBecause Buck knows how much you like hanging out with him. And we might not for a little while, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u00a0\nGood lord, with the whys, \u201cBecause Buck didn\u2019t wanna be best friends anymore, and your dad didn\u2019t know that,\u201d he huffs, \u201cNow do you wanna pick a movie?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay if you\u2019re not best friends, Dad, I already knew that.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow\u2019d you know that?\u201d Eddie resists the sudden rise of panic in his voice.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAbuela told me.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd well, he takes a note from Chris on this one, \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou ask a lot of questions, Dad,\u201d Chris giggles, pulling the blanket back to his side of the couch.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell can you answer them for me?\u201d Eddie reaches a hand over to where he knows Chris is most ticklish. He\u2019s a man on a mission at this point, he\u2019s not ashamed to go to extreme measures.\n\u00a0\nWith an exasperated huff Chris says, \u201cI was mad at you that you didn\u2019t let me go to ice skating with Buck. Because we always do stuff together. Because we\u2019re best friends. But abuela said ice skating wasn\u2019t for best friends, and you and Buck weren\u2019t best friends now so that\u2019s why you didn\u2019t take me. And then I wasn\u2019t mad anymore.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd isn\u2019t it wonderful to know the universe got his grandmother and his son in on the joke too.\n\u00a0\nEveryone knew Eddie was dating Buck. Except for Eddie.\n\u00a0\nChris hasn\u2019t taken his eyes off the screen the entire time, much more interested in whatever category of Netflix he\u2019s browsing than the fact that he just gave his father more insight on his relationship than he could figure out himself. Like it wasn\u2019t a huge deal.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Dad, I can still be Buck\u2019s best friend.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cCourse you can, kid,\u201d Eddie wants to cry at the sweetness of the whole thing, kisses the top of Chris\u2019s head. \u201cYou can come ice skating with us next time, if you want.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGross, no,\u201d Christopher sticks out his tongue and crinkles his nose, making Eddie laugh, \u201cThen Buck wouldn\u2019t know it\u2019s a date.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBuck knows they\u2019re dates, just not that your dad wants to keep having them.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cForever?\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie thinks about the sight of his son curled up on the floor of Buck\u2019s apartment, measuring their love in distance to the stars on his ceiling.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah kid, forever.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThen you should tell him that.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMaybe, Eddie figures, at this point in the game he should be taking all romantic pointers from his infinitely wise beyond his years eight-year-old.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou think so?\u201d\n\u00a0\nChris nods, peeking up at Eddie quickly under his glasses, \u201cJust pinky promise him for forever. You can\u2019t break a pink promise.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe says it like it\u2019s that simple, and maybe it is.\n\u00a0\nWith a big exhale, Eddie wraps an arm tighter around him and looks up the TV, \u201cLet\u2019s watch Toy Story, huh? Your dad has a lot to learn about friendship.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhat finally does it is when he shows up to his abuela\u2019s house the next night for family dinner.\n\u00a0\nHis aunt opens the door, all warmth and smiles and kisses, pushes Chris inside, backpack already open and ready to spill his markers on the floor to color with them, but she stops suddenly after placing two sloppy kisses on Eddie\u2019s cheeks.\n\u00a0\n\u201cJust you?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTry to reel in your enthusiasm there,\u201d Eddie drawls sarcastically, as he starts to step into the house.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAy, be quiet Eddito,\u201d she pushes him teasingly on the back of the head, \u201cI just thought your boyfriend was coming. I made him my soup he likes, to take home, I know you don\u2019t feed him well.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\nBoyfriend.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nHis mind is racing, he barely registers anyone still speaking, his aunt yelling to abuela in the other room, \u201cGuess you could bring it home to him, oh, I\u2019m so bad with names, what\u2019d you say it was, Isabel? Evan?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHis name is Buck, tia,\u201d Chris tilts his head, grinning from his seat at the table, \u201cAnd daddy\u2019s sad because he still thought they were best friends.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBest friends?\u201d his abuela chooses now to come into the room from the kitchen, a sly smile on her lips, flourishing her spoon around in the air for effect, \u201cThis one I gotta hear.\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie isn\u2019t sure how long it takes for all his thoughts to settle, for him to see only one answer, but he\u2019s got three people smiling t him when he does.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, Chris? You wanna sleep over abuela\u2019s tonight?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe arrives outside Buck\u2019s door that night without beer or an eight-year-old, but with a pinky promise instead.\n\u00a0\nAdrenaline got him here and nothing else. But now that he\u2019s standing in front of it, he\u2019s scared shitless.\n\u00a0\nHe worked up a laundry list of things to air out, all the things he wanted to say, all the ways he loved him. Because there\u2019s so much, so much he knows he could say, wants to say, has to say, and it still would never be enough. He spent the whole drive here backtracking the last month, hating himself for missing so much, for yearning for something he had and making himself believe he didn\u2019t.\n\u00a0\nBut when Buck opens the door, all that comes out is a whispered, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cEddie?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes,\u201d he tries, with more conviction this time, trying to steady his breathing.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou asked me if I wanted to get dinner, just the two of us, like a date, so I\u2019m saying yes.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cEddie, you don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI have wanted you to ask me that question for longer than I remember, and I can\u2019t believe I was too busy listening to heavy metal to hear it,\u201d Eddie shakes his head, \u201cBecause the answer is yes.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know you feel bad about it, but I told you it\u2019s fine, Eddie,\u201d Buck\u2019s entire demeanor is slouched, retreating, defeated, \u201cI misread, and I made things weird. And I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t have a better explanation for you right now but I thought I had until work on Monday to figure out what to say\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to wait until Monday,\u201d Eddie huffs, \u201cI know you said you\u2019d wait forever for me but I\u2019m done waiting.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cEddie\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cStop saying my name like I\u2019m leaving,\u201d Eddie says, open and raw and earnest, \u201cI\u2019m not leaving, I just got here. I know I\u2019m late, I know it looks like it took me longer but I\u2019m here.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBuck looks like he\u2019s going to say something again, probably just another iteration of his name, but opens and closes his mouth, wraps a hand around the edge of the door.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI am really bad with feelings. I\u2019m bad at understanding my own and understanding other\u2019s and making sense of them, of sharing them the right way, of even feeling them at all I think,\u201d Eddie feels like pacing, but stays locked on Buck\u2019s blue eyes, \u201cBut dammit, Buck, I feel so much. I feel everything for you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBuck\u2019s lips part in a small gasp of air, \u201cEverything?\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie laughs, repeats like a vow, \u201cEverything.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThat doesn\u2019t feel like enough though, and now that he\u2019s started, he doesn\u2019t want to stop.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI feel happy when I see you, when you come running in through my front door, when you smile at me hanging upside down off my couch during movie night. I feel relieved when you run out of a scene unharmed, I feel anxious when you take too long. I feel tired when you keep me up all night, texting me facts about whatever shit you\u2019re mindlessly researching that night but I feel special that you chose to text them to me, that I keep your nightmares away,\u201d Eddie chokes back heavy emotion, dancing his eyes over Buck\u2019s unreadable face.\n\u00a0\nEddie continues, \u201cI feel like you\u2019re a pain in my ass, most of the time,\u201d earning him a laugh, \u201cBut I feel like it\u2019s worth it. I feel calm when you hold my hand in the car like it\u2019s nothing, I feel like a seventh grader with a crush when you borrow my shirts, and I feel downright smitten when I think about you kissing me.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBuck opens his door a little wider.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI feel so many things I don\u2019t have words for, things that emotions don\u2019t exist to describe yet. When I see you with Chris, the way you talk to him and hold him and teach him, make him a part of your world and love him so unconditionally that I feel like we could never deserve it. When I see you in my kitchen in the morning making yourself coffee, asking what I want for breakfast, and feel like this is the life I\u2019ve been missing out on. When I watched you put your niece to sleep in your arms, bounce her in your lap and dote on your sister and Chim like their happiness in that moment made the world spin and you were gonna keep it that way, how I felt like I\u2019d have six more kids just to have them with you like that. How you find me in any room we\u2019re in and make me feel like I made the room worth being in.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBuck bites his lips together, his eyes finding their way back to brightness, \u201cSix kids?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat, you want seven?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBuck laughs, swings the door out with the motion.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd mostly, for the last month I have felt hopeless,\u201d Eddie starts again, seriously, \u201cLike I was seeing things that weren\u2019t there, like I was making up all these feelings in my head, like if I asked for everything I saw to be real, that I\u2019d be asking for things you couldn\u2019t give me. So I didn\u2019t ask for anything at all. Because I\u2019d rather have you at a distance, like, the moon, than not have you at all.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI thought,\u201d Eddie adds on, when Buck just continues to stare into him, \u201cthat everything was normal. I had no idea you had changed our relationship, and I thought it was all still a part of friendship. It drove me crazy, thinking if even this didn\u2019t cross the line, I\u2019d never get you without anything short of a waxing romantic confession. And even then, I wasn\u2019t sure that would work. So I kept it all to myself. And I have no idea what to do next, other than to ask for you to ask me out again so I can say yes. Because I have never wanted something more than I want this with you. I want the first date and the second date and the bad dates and the early mornings and getting you a toothbrush for my bathroom and embarrassing Chris, hell I want the white picket fence and a dog with you, newspapers on our porch when we\u2019re old and gray\u2014 I want everything with you, man.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSilence stretches between them, Eddie counting every beat of his heart while it does. It never slows down, even as time does. Eddie has never put his heart on the line before, has never felt to vulnerable, like he could rip at any moment, and he puts himself actively in the line of danger in work every day. This is infinitely scarier.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s felt like years since anyone\u2019s said anything, and Eddie can hear Buck\u2019s TV playing softly in the background.\n\u00a0\nBuck looks down, then up, at Eddie\u2019s lips and then his eyes, and says, \u201cThat has to be the most romantic thing anyone\u2019s ever said, not just to me, but to anyone in the world,\u201d Buck swallows, \u201cAnd you ended it by calling me man.\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie releases a breath he didn\u2019t know he was holding.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you not a man?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI am,\u201d Buck giggles, honestly giggles and Eddie\u2019s been a goner for a while but holy shit if he\u2019s not falling hard and fast, \u201cAnd it worked, in case you were wondering.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat worked?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe waxing romantic confession,\u201d Buck winks, \u201cYou\u2019ve got a future in rom-coms, if the firefighter thing doesn\u2019t work out.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThanks.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnytime.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis is some really nice banter we\u2019ve got going on here, like really, A+ effort,\u201d Eddie rolls sarcastically, \u201cBut I heard we\u2019ve both been waiting two years for something...\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGod, Edmundo, at least let me buy you dinner first,\u201d Buck quips, reaching out to grab Eddie\u2019s hand and pull him closer.\n\u00a0\nEddie\u2019s eyebrows jump up.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCan I please take you out to dinner?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cJust the two of us?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cLike a date,\u201d Buck whispers, close enough that Eddie can feel it more than hear it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFinally,\u201d Eddie whispers back, before closing the gap.\n\u00a0\nEddie isn\u2019t sure how he ever thought kissing Buck would be (which, is a lie, he\u2019s thought about it plenty) but nothing abstract could compare to the real thing.\n\u00a0\nHis chapped lips fold into Eddie\u2019s, the softest pressure when they meet exploding into something fervent and all-consuming suddenly. The floodgates open and so do Buck\u2019s lips, coaxing Eddie\u2019s into his, teeth biting bottom lip. Eddie seeks purchase in the hem of Buck\u2019s shirt, his fingers wringing, wrapping around his waist as Buck\u2019s fingers dance over his shoulders, wrap around his neck and twist circles into the nape. They don\u2019t stop kissing through it all, the shuffle of feet, the laugh Buck leaves on Eddie\u2019s lips when he tries to pull him closer, hip-check the door shut, the breath Eddie leaves in Buck\u2019s ear as he works gentle kisses across his jaw, as Eddie feels pricks of energy at every point of contact he has with Buck\u2019s body.\n\u00a0\nHe kisses him again and again and again because he can and he\u2019s so self-indulgent about it because he can be. Eddie licks Buck\u2019s bottom lip and memorizes the hitch of breath, Eddie tracks his fingers into one of Buck\u2019s back pockets and relishes in the gentle nudge on he gives him, Eddie traps Buck against the wall next to his now shut front door and breathes in his scent, kisses him again, their teeth clinking together because they both can\u2019t stop smiling.\n\u00a0\nIt sends him to the moon.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI love you,\u201d Buck rushes into a breath before Eddie can capture his lips again, \u201cI can start building the white picket fence tomorrow.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be real,\u201d Eddie shakes his head and the faintest movement nudges their noses together, an intimate gesture that makes Buck giggle, \u201cSeriously, I don\u2019t think men like you can exist.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m case it\u2019s wasn\u2019t already very clear, I want everything with you too,\u201d Buck ignored his rubbing and continues, breathily, not daring to move their faces more than an inch apart, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I had to woo you for a month to get you to realize it, but I\u2019ll woo you for the rest of my life.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cStop saying woo.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll woo you as much as I please, thank you very much, I happen to rather enjoy doing it,\u201d Buck\u2019s smile glints in the dim hallway lighting, \u201cI\u2019ve got a whole list of dates to take you on now that you\u2019re in on it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m warning you, I\u2019m terrible at dating.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d Buck huffs, \u201cI\u2019ve been dating you for a month, you\u2019re fantastic at it.\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie kisses him again. And again.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI love you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo I hear,\u201d Buck teases, his eyebrows quirked and his fingers dancing on Eddie\u2019s lower back, \u201cThough I think eventually you should probably be the one to ask me to marry you, just to avoid any confusion. God forbid I try to pop the question while you\u2019re booking a dentist appointment or something.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo you wanna marry me?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBuck seems stunned at the immediate question, but only for a moment, before settling into a smile.\n\u00a0\nEddie asks it like it\u2019s obvious, and judging by Buck\u2019s grin, maybe it is.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he breathes our gently, before kissing Eddie affectionately all over his face, his cheeks, his nose, between his eyebrows, across his forehead down his jaw.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou promise?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBuck pushes Eddie back, one hand gently on his chest, before bringing his other hand up between their faces, his hand balled in a fist with his pinky out.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI promise.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou can\u2019t break that.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie links his pinky, kisses Buck square on the lips.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo, how about that first date?\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie tosses his head back in laughter, backing up a full step from Buck to take a breath, shake out his adrenaline and start towards the center of Buck\u2019s apartment, \u201cI promise I won\u2019t bring Chris to this one.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you kidding, I love Chris!\u201d Buck yells, appalled that Eddie could ever imply differently, \u201cHe can come on any date. Promise.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBut Eddie just gives him a pointed look.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s a really nice gesture, but any date?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m good with animated movie nights and 9pm bedtime for the rest of my life,\u201d Buck smiles.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Eddie nods, \u201cBut in case it mattered at all, he\u2019s sleeping at my abuela\u2019s tonight.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBuck\u2019s back on in with inhuman speed.\n\u00a0\nAs Eddie\u2019s laughing his way backwards, trying not to trip as Buck eagerly push/kisses him towards his stairs, stopping them for a minute against the kitchen counter, he notices what a mess Buck\u2019s kitchen is. There\u2019s an empty box of tissues, the garbage needs to be taken out, he thinks there\u2019s cold pizza left next to the microwave and\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u201cWere you eating ice cream before I got here?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBuck eyes Eddie up and down, before grabbing his hand and dragging him away.\n\u00a0\nWhile they trip up the stairs laughing, Buck says, \u201cGive me a break, my boyfriend just broke up with me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, so you\u2019re a hot single firefighter now?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTaken, just pinky promised on it,\u201d Buck winks as he pushes Eddie back onto his bed, \u201cBut if you were willing to confer with the hot part...\u201d\n\u00a0\nEddie will walk the distance to the stars loving him.\n\u00a0\nHe pinky promises.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0"
