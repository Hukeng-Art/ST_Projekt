basic idea of like one thing that's going to happen, so hopefully, this doesn't flunk lol</p>\n<p>also the times are in florida time, so just remember george is 5 hours ahead :) (i think)</p>\n<p>like every other fic, this is a work of fiction, hence the name fanfiction, and it's for entertainment purposes.</p>\n<p>now that all of that is out of the way, i hope you enjoy!!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_1_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>i'd appreciate it if i could get some feedback on the way i formatted it! i tried to make it look somewhat aesthetic and nice, but i'm not sure if it turned out good enough;;</p>\n<p>just to clarify, the strikethrough means that they typed it out then deleted it, whether it be a whole message or just a few words</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_3_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>i have gotten a lot more love on this than i expected to get<br>and<br>i'm honestly in shock<br>thank you guys so much ;w;<br>i really appreciate it<br>and it gives me more motivation than i ever deemed possible<br>it's thanks to you wonderful people that i haven't already given up on this like i thought i would, so thank you so so so much &lt;3333</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>also i came up with that pickup line on the spot, and i am honestly super proud of it</p>\n<p>so we're going to pretend the name alyssa was on purpose :))<br>just so that everyone knows, i have nothing against her, and i promise she's not even a bad character in this story<br>she also isn't even going to be mentioned again until the very end<br>so there's that</p>\n<p>sorry this chapter took so long to get out<br>for whatever reason it was kind of hard to write, and i kept getting distracted</p>\n<p>but anyways<br>i hope you all are having a good day, and enjoy the chapter :)</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_4_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>OH ALSO WE HIT TRIPLE DIGITS FOR KUDOS, AND THAT'S SUPER CRAZY TO ME!!!!<br>THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH, YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU FOR READING THIS!!!! &lt;33333333<br>and we're so close to 1000 hits like i'm gonna die when that happens oml</p>\n<p>i completely forgot to mention this in the last chapter but<br>CONGRATS TO DREAM FOR 4 MIL AND GEORGE FOR 1 MIL!!!<br>i'm so proud of theM<br>they're all grown up :,)</p>\n<p>WE DID IT<br>1000 HITS<br>AND 200 KUDOS<br>THIS IS ABSOLUTELY CRAZY, THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH<br>MY MIND<br>IS BLOWN</p>\n<p>take this filler chapter that's two times longer than usual as my thanks for all the support &lt;33333<br>(i apologize if there's any formatting mistakes in this chapter, i'm really tired)</p>\n<p>i apologize that this chapter is kind of short! it's a really important chapter and turning point for one of them, so i wanted it to be by itself. i'm planning on the next chapter being the start of the main plot, but i'm not 100% sure yet, so we'll see :)</p>\n<p>it's finally here</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_8_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>the end :)</p>\n<p>AHHAAIHIAHIAHFIEWUHFWIUFEHWIUFH<br>in the words of our lord and savior dreamus christ YOU JUST GOT PRANKED I'M GONNA P E E MYSELF</p>\n<p>you guys made me laugh SO MUCH that i'm pretty sure my life span increased by 1000 years</p>\n<p>it was really fun</p>\n<p>but anyways<br>did you guys REALLY think i'd have the audacity to end it there?<br>i absolutely HATE sad endings, so i could never bring myself to write one<br>hurt/no comfort is cursed, get that shit away from me i don't want it D:&lt;<br>also, it would be stupid if it ended there<br>because that was only the beginning ;)</p>\n<p>i have no idea how much longer this fic is going to go on but it's probably going to be at least 3-4 more chapters, most likely more depending on how they turn out and any other ideas i may have so don't worry &lt;3<br>ALSO SOMEHOW WE ALREADY HIT 300 KUDOS AND 2000 HITS LIKE Y'ALL CRAZY<br>ew i just used y'all someone kill me<br>BUT TYSM YOU'RE ALL AMAZING AND DESERVE THE WORLD &lt;333333<br>if you're still pissed at me tho that's fair :( i deserve it lmao</p>\n<p>OKAY THIS IS THE LAST TIME I'M GOING TO SCREAM ABOUT ACHIEVEMENTS<br>i reached most kudos out of the dreamnotfound fics under the minecraft fandom!!<br>this is INSANE to me, and i wouldn't have been able to do it without you guys!!!!<br>like seriously, thank you &lt;3333<br>i probably won't stay up there for long, but i'm enjoying it while i can haha</p>\n<p>i didn't even realize that one of the days would fall on july 4th ieufhifeuh but it's fine, i used it to my benefit &gt;:P</p>\n<p>this is my favorite chapter by far ewufhfwie<br>grab a snack before you read this<br>it may be short, but there's a lot packed in this chapter, and it's kinda emotional</p>\n<p>everything going on rn is crazy;;</p>\n<p>also, stay tuned for chapter 14 :D it's already finished, so i'll post it sometime soon</p>\n<p>imagine if i did a chapter with sapnap</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_14_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>it physically hurt me to write such bad grammar :,(<br>also i genuinely don't like this chapter (which sucks because i've been planning to do this for a while, but it felt kind of unnatural, especially with the fact that i made it sound like clay already knows he has a super huge crush on george but like idk man)<br>if you guys don't like it, i'll delete it or rewrite it or have them talk about something else :)</p>\n<p>oops my finger slipped</p>\n<p>so since a few people asked/guessed wrong as to what the deleted message said, i will explain!<br>basically in the text, george was admitting that knowing that clay was giving his attention to sapnap rather than himself made him pretty jealous<br>if he had kept that and continued texting afterwards without realizing how weird that sounded, he would have most likely ended up letting it slip that he's kind of totally head over heels for clay<br>it could've been a confession chapter<br>but it wasn't \ud83d\ude43</p>\n<p>besides that<br>uhh<br>i'm sorry for hurting everyone last chapter, so have this to make up for it :D</p>\n<p>i've been building up to this for 16 chapters<br>here we go-</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_18_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>i know i said i wasn't going to do a chapter where george and sapnap talk since it doesn't fit the flow but i just HAD to;;</p>\n<p>HI OMG I HAVEN'T UPDATED THIS IN 4 DAYS I'M SO SORRY;;;</p>\n<p>just in case anyone gets confused, the time changes to the london time zone when dream lands so that the time isn't wack and confusing :)</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_19_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>and since i can't exactly write the meetup without breaking the texting format i'm just gonna confirm that dream did in fact pick george up and spin him around when they hugged<br>and then<br>kissed him \ud83d\ude33</p>\n<p>HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN??<br>TWO <b>ENTIRE</b> MONTHS???</p>\n<p>i'm so sorry i'm such a bad person<br>i lost interest too fast in this fic<br>i recently got sick, however<br>and got hit with a batch of inspiration<br>so here we are<br>the final chapter of [message redacted] (plus an epilogue that'll come later)<br>enjoy ;)</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_20_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>fin :)</p>\n<p>yo \u270c\ufe0f<br>i can finally sleep at night knowing that this is finished :,D</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_21_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>was about time for me to post the epilogue, yeah?<br>everyone's probably lost interest at this point, but i finally got it the way i wanted (and yet i'm still super unsure about it ughhh)<br>now that i've done this, i can officially say this is the first multi-chapter fic that i've finished</p>\n<p>it was really fun (whenever i actually worked on it haha), and it made me super happy to read all your comments and see that while i enjoyed making it, you enjoyed reading :)</p>\n<p>i hope the epilogue was worth the wait, and it feels so free to finally be <i>finished</i> (even though it's technically been finished...i don't know if the epilogue counts)<br>that being said, have a great day, and thank you for reading [message redacted]!!</p>",
