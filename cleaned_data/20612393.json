The young star that made his debut at the age of seventeen where he secured a role in one of Lan Qiren\u2019s most famous series and his fame has never looked back since. Despite being absent from the entertainment industry for two whole years, the young and talented actor made his full comeback and starred in this year\u2019s mega-hit drama \u201cLove, destiny.\u201d Fans can\u2019t get enough of Wei Wuxian and his captivating smile and honestly neither can we!\n\n\u00a0\n\n[image: Wei Wuxian looking at the camera with a wide smile]\nWe thought it will be fun to share some facts about this wonderful person with you all!\u00a0\u00a0\n\n1.Wei Wuxian is an orphan\n\nYes, you read that correctly. Wei Wuxian\u2019s parents died when he was only two years old and he also lived in an orphanage for a year! He was adopted by Jiang Fengmian at the tender age of three and thus begins the wholesome relationship between the three siblings; Jiang Yanli, Jiang Cheng and Wei Wuxian!\n[image: A smiling, young Jiang Yanli holding two little boys in her arms. Wei Wuxian is looking at the camera with a broad smile while Jiang Cheng looks at his sister meekly with a blush on his face]\nIf you have not been living under a wrong, you\u2019ll definitely know what we are talking about! Those two brother are overly protective of their older sister and Jiang Yanli herself is ready to have a talk with anyone who lash out on her brothers. Honestly this special bond these three share is something really precious and fans can never get enough of their interactions.\n\n2. Wuxian is called wifi\n\nHis name Wuxian means \u201cno envy\u201d, but Wei Wuxian is lovingly called Wifi by his fans, due to the homonym between the Chinese word for Wi-Fi and his name Wuxian.\n[image: Wei Wuxian with his hair in a messy bun wearing a t-shirt with a wifi symbol on it. Jiang Cheng can be seen wearing the same t-shirt sitting behind but he has a look of utter disgust on his face]\n\n3. Wei Wuxian is not single\n\nYes. So any new fangirls planning to make on a move on him, you all are already too late. Wei Wuixan has been dating his highschool crush who is none other than Lan Wangji, the famous singer for three years now. The couple are called \u201cWangxian\u201d by their fans and shippers and they also have been seen using the ship name many times \u00a0They are living embodiment of Childhood Friend to Lovers.\n[GIF: Wei Wuxian greeting Lan Wangj with a kiss on the cheek and lips. This was taken when Lan Wangji made a visit on the set of \u201cLove, Destiny\u201d to surprise Wei Wuxian]\n\n4. He suffers from a severe case of cynophobia\n\nCynophobia is the fear of dogs and our wifi has never missed a chance to express his loathing and fear of them. \u00a0\nRemember the time when Wei Wuxian had to shoot with a dog on set and he almost had a full blown panic attack? The directors had to cut that scene out from the script and Wei Wuxian had later apologized profusely for the inconvenience.\n[GIF: Wei Wuxian looking straight into the camera and declaring his hate for dogs. The subtitles read: \u201cThose awful beasts shouldn\u2019t exist\u201d]\n\n5.He is also a really good artist and singer.\n\nWei Wuxian is multi-talented, there is no doubt about this fact. Before enrolling himself in an acting school, he was actually pursuing to become a graphic designer! If you follow him on his various social media accounts you\u2019ll find him posting his various doodles and sketches. His recent ones mostly include of his boyfriend Lan Wangji and rabbits.\nDo you remember the famous duet by Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian that broke the internet and the fans? It was in a live stream and a fan requested him to sing a song with Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian, bless this man, forced Lan Wangji to sing the song which in his words \u201cYou\u00a0 had written for me, Lan Zhan.\u201d \u00a0Unfortunately we never got to here this song dubbed as \u201cWangxian duet\u201d by the fans again but Wei Wuxian\u2019s singing voice clearly enraptured us all.\n[GIF: Lan Wangji and Wei Wuixan sitting in front of the camera in a live stream. Wei Wuxian cheerfully suggests something to the other. The subtitles read: Let\u2019s sing the song you wrote for me!\u201d]\n\nMORE LIKE THIS:\n\n\n  10 latest upcoming dramas you surely wouldn\u2019t want to miss  \n\n\n  Lan Wangji to release a surprise new single soon!

GUYS!!!! I think I have a new theory??? Maybe.\u00a0\nLan Wangji dropped his new single today out of all days and it was totally unexpected too. So it got me thinking and I wondered why did he release it today (cause my brain loves to spent hours contemplating shitdon\u2019t call me out) and I think I have come up with a solid theory.\nI know whatever I type here remains only a whimsical fantasy of mine but hear me out okay\n*takes a deep breath*\nLan Wangji fell in love with Wei Wuxian today on 12th of September. (or realized that he was in love)\nI know you all are going to call me crazy but I come here with evidence and proofs.\nFirst Nie Huiasang\u2019s tweet here. which gave me the first hint. Lan Wangji clearly looks smitten in this picture. Now a important thing to remember here is the date. 12.09.2009\n\u00a0\nSecond let us see this tweet here from Lan Wangji\u2019s producer which clearly states that \u201csempiternal\u201d had an early release and Lan Wangji especially insisted it to be today. Why? Read my theory above. Now *rolls up sleeves* lets examine the lyrics to this beautiful song as well.\nThe very first line\n\nA story that took place before autumn \n\n(I did my research guys. So in 2009 autumn started on 23 September. And the lyrics say that the story takes place before autumn. ARE YALL GETTING MY POINT? 12 SEPTEMBER!!)\n\nYou looked at me that day,\n\n\nAnd suddenly I realize\n\n\nI can never look away again\n\n(THIS)\n\nDays pass away \n\n\nBut my heart hasn\u2019t rested since\n\n\n\u201cLove\u201d it sang\n\n(okay. So days pass away right? But how many? We don\u2019t know. But but but the next lyrics)\n\nA day before the festival \n\n\nI prepared words to say it all\n\n\n\u00a0you smiled and gazed at me\n\n\nAnd I could remember them no longer.\n\n(a day before the festival. One might think which festival. WELL GUESS WHAT mid-autumn festival was celebrated on 3 oct 2009. Conincidence? I think not)\nNow coming back to the first line.\n\u201ca story that took place before autumn\u201d that means before 23 sep. which means lwj could have fallen in love with wwx before that.\nThis interview here with wwx where he clearly states and I quote \u201cLan Zhan says that he had fallen for me by the time we were 15. Guess how old they were in 2009?\nAnd here and here is a tweet from Jiang Yanli with her brothers and lwj on mid-autumn festival labeled \u201c2009\u201d and she said this picture gives \u201cSempiternal\u201d vibes.\nKnowing how cryptic nhs is I wouldn\u2019t go pass by his tweet. Combining his tweet, lwj insistence to release the song today (12), Jiang Yanli\u2019s tweet and the song lyrics\nLadies and gentlemen, gals and pals, I have come to the conclusion that lwj fell head over heels for wwx on 12 Sep 2009.\nAlso\nThe last line of the song\n\u00a0A story that took place that day\n\nThe day I realized I was in love\n\nI MEAN CAN IT BE ANYMORE OBVIOUS\n\nrealdeal\n\nOP I luv you for this post.

There are some that make us laugh while others simply make us swoon with their public displays of affection, both on and off screen. We are proud to say that Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji fall in both of the above categories! Wangxian is the internet\u2019s power couple; there is no denying this fact. And the history they share together is nothing short of legendry.\nWangxian is every every fanfic trope there is under the sun and listed below are reasons why!\n\u00a0\nWe all know that Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji have known each other since childhood. They went to the same school together, studied in the same high school and enrolled themselves in the same college. One would say that they quickly became friends but wasn\u2019t the case! Infact Wei Wuxian stated in an interview, \u201cI used to try every possible trick in the world to drive Lan Zhan mad! It was no wonder that he hated me back then.\u201d We are not sure about the hate part, because looking at them now, Lan Wangji clearly did not \u2018hate\u2019 him.\u00a0 An interview with Nie Huiasang, the popular stylist and also a school mate of theirs said \u201cLan Wangji and Wei Wuxian were always down on each other\u2019s throat. We all thought they were rivals.\u201d Academic rivalry or more like unresolved sexual tension\u2026..\nAlso\nEnemies to Friends to Lovers, anyone?\n\u00a0\nAs we mentioned above, they both attended the same schools and colleges. But fan will be delighted to know that Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji were also lab partners! \u201cWei Ying is the reason I failed a semester in Chemistry.\u201d Lan Wangji admitted in a talk show. One can only imagine what other kinds of trouble Wei Wuxian got Lan Wangji into!\n\u2026and there was only one bed. Just kidding but Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian shared a dorm together back in their highschool days and despite there being two beds, rumour has it that Wangxian often shared one bed together.\nOh, you read that correctly. Recently Lan Wangji confirmed in a tweet that he fell in love with Wei Wuxian at the age 15. But we all know that Wangxian got together only three years prior, when they were both 22. Lan Wangji, bless his pure heart, pined for Wei Wuxian for seven years straight.\nAnd apparently the pining was not one sided, Wei Wuxian with an interview for TheGossips confirmed as such\n(Excerpt from TheGossips Magzine: \u201cI knew what Lan Zhan and I shared was more than friendship but I couldn\u2019t place a name to that feeling. The idea of being in love with that man back then was\u2026new and terrifying. [He laughs] I\u2019m glad Lan Wangji confessed when he did; otherwise it would have taken me another five years to do so!)\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji made his debut as a singer and actor in the same year as Wei Wuxian with the same series! The thrilling adventures of Hanguang-jun and Yiling Laozu directed by none other than the Lan Qiren, also Lan Wangji\u2019s uncle was an immediate hit, the dynamic between our two heroes both on-screen and off-screen was too hard for the fans to ignore and thus came the emergence of Wangxian shippers. The series had a particular scene where Hanguang-jun and the Yiling Laozu kiss, and that my folks was the first time wangxian ever kissed! Years later during the celebration of the 5 Year anniversary of the show, Wei Wuxian said, \u201dThe kiss was awkward but it also made me realize my feelings for him. Hahaha, I definitely wanted to kiss him again after that.\u201d\u00a0 Unfortunately we will never see this dynamic coupe on screen together again as Lan Wangji mentioned that acting was not his forte and he wants to focus on his music career.\nLike really\u2026..At the age of fifteen, during the mid-autumn festival, when they won their first awards together, at their first red carpet when they were each other\u2019s dates\u2026.like the opportunites were endless.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMORE LIKE THIS:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n  10 times Wangixan were Relationship goals  \n\n\n  \u00a0  \n\n\n  Wangxian PDA: Real or fake?

His embrace is warm, Wei Wuxian wants to stay there forever and never let go.\n\u201cThat got over far too soon,\u201d Wei Wuxian murmurs, \u201cLet\u2019s get married again.\u201d\nLan Wangji\u2019s eyes light up and he lets out a small huff of laughter, he, much to Wei Wuxian\u2019s delight presses his face into his neck to hide it. Wei Wuxian starts giggling. The situation is not funny; it is just that he is just so extremely in love with his husband.\nLan Wangji\u2019s lips move from his neck to his cheek. Wei Wuxian leans forward to share a kiss. What a beautiful feeling it was, knowing that there were in love.\n.\n.\nor in other words\ni write a self-indulgent wangxian marriage and go nuts\n\nLanguage:\u00a0\u00a0 English\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Words:\u00a0 8,054\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chapters:\u00a0 1/1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Comments:\u00a0 500\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Kudos:\u00a0 2009\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bookmarks:\u00a0 147\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hits: 10867\n\n\n________\n\n\u00a0\n\njiangchenghot\n\n[image] [image]\n(Image description: A side by side comparison.

Whether it comes to folk music, country (whatever-the-heck-genre) singer Lan Wangji, you\u2019re one of the two people who fall into these categories: you either love him or despise his existence and his fan base with your entire being (the population of the latter is rather small). \u00a0\nSadly just like any other celeb Lan Wangji is no stranger to gossips and rumuors with the latest one revolving around his affair going on with none other than the hottest sensation Wen Qing! Although it hasn\u2019t gotten much momentum with Sempiternal\u2019s release (and #wangxianday) we are not going to be the evil ones and add fuel to those rumours but the real question that stands right now is: Is Sempiternal really a Wangxian love song?\nThe general answer from most of you all will be \u2018of course, it is!\u2019 But our team did some dirty digging and found out about how this is all just a PR stunt!\nThe famous Wangxian couple is notorious for selling their relationship online.

IT WAS RIGHT IN FRONT OF OUR EYES.\n*crackes knuckles*\nFirst a little detail on A-Yuan. Until now we all only know that he is a distinct relative of Wen Ning and Wen Qing.\nWELL LOOK AT THIS IMAGE. It was taken by\u00a0 paparazzi several months. In this image Wen Ning and Wei Wuxian met for Brunch? Lunch?\nand we all went wild over their reunion. but but but, look closely guys\n[image]\n(image description: A very very zoomed image of the Wei Wuxian-Wen NIng meeting the paparazzi took. The image is zoomed in on a child a little further away from Wen Ning squatting o the ground playing with something)\nTHAT\u2019S FUCKING LAN YUAN. HE WAS THERE. RIGHT THERE.\nThen here, here, here, here, here and here are all the Lan Wangji and Wen Qing meetups. Wei Wuxian is there in almost all of them. (also these were the reasons, the \u00a0Wen Qing is dating Lan Wangji gossip surged up).\nNow go back and check the second article again. See that lady in the black dress sitting beside Wei Wuxain?\u00a0 She is Wei Wuxian\u2019s lawyer!!!! Now have you connected the dots??? if you haven\u2019t then you are really dumb.\nMOVING ON\nthey eloped. they got married. they are husbands now but the question is BUT WHEN??? pls wifi I beg you tell us the date tell us the date\nREMEMBER THAT VACATION WANGXIAN TOOK RIGHT BEFORE SEMPITERNAL\u2019S RELEASE??? I bet my life that it was then.\nMy evidence is right here in the Sempiternal music video. \nYou know how we all complained about how wifi didn\u2019t appear in that video. WELL because of our whining we missed another important detail. GUYS GUYS almost all of the Sempiternal music video displays just Lan Wangji\u2019s fingers playing the guqin. Do you know what one wears on a finger? RING GUYS RING. IT!!!! IS!!!! THERE!!!\nThat is definitely the wedding ring. (lwj rarely wears jewelry y\u2019all that is definetly the wedding ring)\nAND\u2026\u2026the shooting of Sempiternal music video started right after their return from their vacation.
