    "text": "Stiles doesn\u2019t exactly mean to start cleaning up after everybody, it\u2019s just that, well, sometimes he thinks Derek turned them into actual animals. \nThey\u2019ve been meeting at the Hale house for a long time, now, long enough that Derek had finally given in to everybody\u2019s silent looks of disdain (well, Lydia\u2019s silent looks of disdain) and started fixing it up. The first room he finished after the downstairs bathroom was Isaac\u2019s , which is actually too cute for words. But after that it had been the living room, big and drafty, but pretty cozy now that it has things like carpets and curtains and actual walls. Then it was the kitchen, and now it\u2019s just whatever odds and ends and bits Derek seems to feel like working on. Stiles figures he worked on his own room at some point, but nobody\u2019s ever seen it so it\u2019s hard to confirm. \nSo, once there\u2019s an actual house to hang out in, and everyone\u2019s there until the evening exhausting themselves on training, it becomes sort of normal for the whole pack to pile in and watch crappy movies, or sometimes play videogames. They usually convince someone (generally Stiles or Derek, given the existence of their cars) to go pick up takeout. Stiles totally didn\u2019t intend to clean up after anybody, but on this particular night, he\u2019s the last person to go into the kitchen to throw away his paper plate, and it\u2019s just gross. That\u2019s why, when Derek pads quietly into the room, Stiles is up to his elbows in paper towels, wiping off all the things. Seriously, it\u2019s disgusting. \n\u201cI was going to do that,\u201d Derek says quietly, watching him. Stiles figures it\u2019s true, since the house is never horrifying when they get there, although it usually is by the time they leave. It\u2019s hard to imagine Derek scrubbing his kitchen, alone in the evening, but there\u2019s no other obvious explanation.\nStiles shrugs. \u201cI couldn\u2019t leave it like this,\u201d he admits. \u201cIt\u2019s like they were raised by actual wolves.\u201d\nDerek shrugs back, mirroring Stiles. It\u2019s probably subconscious, but it\u2019s hard to say. Derek is better with body language than he is with words. \nDerek closes the door, leaning comfortably back against it. \u201cNeed help?\u201d \n\u201cNah,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cGo kill zombies.\u201d He can hear the sounds of video-game carnage from the living room, though it\u2019s muffled by the door.\n\u201cPack bonding,\u201d Derek says easily. \u201cThey don\u2019t need me around all the time.\u201d He straightens, all easy grace, and crosses the room, running a hand over the newly wiped-down counter. \u201cThanks.\u201d\n\u201cNo problem,\u201d Stiles says awkwardly, and watches Derek empty the trash with his ridiculous muscles. Stiles is pretty lucky no werewolves seem interested in asking him about it, because there\u2019s no way he\u2019d ever be able to convince them that he wasn\u2019t totally ogling Derek\u2019s ass as he slips out the kitchen door, trash bag in tow.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Derek says a second later, startling Stiles. Nobody should be able to move that fast.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Stiles says, because there isn\u2019t really anything else left to do. They go watch bloody zombie murders, and Stiles is surprisingly content.\nSo after that, it becomes some sort of routine. Everyone comes over and eats, and afterward, Stiles and Derek hang out in the kitchen, ostensibly cleaning, but really just basking in the quiet calm of the evening. Or at least, that\u2019s what Stiles is getting out of it. It\u2019s hard to say why Derek participates, although he seems warmer, easier, when they\u2019re alone like this. He still doesn\u2019t talk much, but it\u2019s comfortable, companionable. He seems to like being up in Stiles\u2019 space, nudging against his shoulder, reaching across him to put glasses back in the cabinet. Stiles, well, Stiles doesn\u2019t mind that at all. \nThe next thing that happens is pretty much a result of Derek being an idiot, which isn\u2019t at all surprising.\nSome dickwad first-liner on the lacrosse team is having a big party for all the cool kids, which means that Scott and Jackson are going (carpooling, no less) and Stiles is emphatically not invited. Scott had told Stiles he could still come along, but he\u2019s not in the mood to watch people be annoyed at his general existence. He ends up at Derek\u2019s instead, having a spirited discussion about werewolf biology and restorative herbs. Derek is actually saying sentences containing multiple words, so both the geek part of Stiles\u2019 brain and the part that takes secret enjoyment out of Derek\u2019s pleasure, are happy.\nIsaac interrupts them right when Stiles is getting to the good part of his monologue. Derek looks grateful for the reprieve. \n\u201cGoing to the party?\u201d Stiles asks him, without malice. All the wolf-y kids are cool, nowadays. \n\u201cYeah,\u201d Isaac says, looking a little nervously at Derek for approval.\n\u201cBe back at nine,\u201d Derek says gruffly. \n\u201dNine?\u201d Stiles says, in disbelief. \u201cHe\u2019s sixteen, not twelve!\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019ll be drinking,\u201d Derek protests mulishly.\n\u201cHe can\u2019t get drunk!\u201d Stiles says, because this is seriously ridiculous.\n\u201cOther people can,\u201d Derek says stubbornly. \u201cDrunk drivers.\u201d\n\u201cSupernatural healing,\u201d Stiles says, and then, without really thinking, \u201cMidnight.\u201d\n\u201c11.30,\u201d Derek says. Stiles shrugs at Isaac, trying to convey,  pick your battles. \nIsaac grins at Stiles and nods. \u201c11.30. Okay.\u201d \nAfter he\u2019s gone, Derek looks over at him across the kitchen table, thoughtful. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you at the party?\u201d\n\u201cNot my scene,\u201d Stiles says breezily, because the real answer is that he kind of likes this, bickering with Derek when the night is quiet and cool, having somewhere to go where he can just relax. He never would have thought that Derek\u2019s house would turn out to be Stiles\u2019 zen place, but there it was. \nDerek shrugs, but Stiles doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s imagining the pleased tilt to his mouth. \u201cMovie?\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d Stiles says, and it\u2019s as easy as that.\nEither they aren\u2019t sitting as far apart on the couch as Stiles could have sworn they were, or Derek has freaky ninja powers. Stiles is betting on the second one, because halfway through the movie, Derek actually manages to doze off. His head lolls heavily, coming to a stop against Stiles\u2019 shoulder, and Stiles is really positive they weren\u2019t close enough for that to happen, like 30 minutes ago tops. He doesn\u2019t mind, though. It\u2019s pretty ridiculous how much he doesn\u2019t mind. Derek looks young like this, sleep smoothing the furrows out of his brow. His face looks soft and open, vulnerable. Stiles has never seen him sleep before, and he\u2019s pretty certain Scott never has either, maybe not even Isaac. He doesn\u2019t know what that means, but definitely something. Stiles sighs and lets Derek lean more heavily on him, relaxing into the couch so that Derek can sleepily tuck his nose against Stiles\u2019 neck and sigh contentedly. It should be scary, but it\u2019s honestly just nice. Stiles wraps his arm around Derek\u2019s ridiculous, muscle-y back and tries not to think about anything at all.\nThe movie\u2019s looping on the menu screen when Isaac gets in. Stiles has been staring at it for at least an hour, but he can\u2019t stand the thought of dislodging Derek, who\u2019s well and truly asleep, his breath heavy and slow against Stiles\u2019 throat. Isaac pauses in the doorway, his eyes dancing between the two of them. Stiles tries to shrug without waking Derek. Isaac shrugs back, grinning.\n\u201cHave fun?\u201d Stiles mouths. \nIsaac nods, and something in his face relaxes, like he still has to work to remember that he\u2019s allowed to be happy, that nobody\u2019s going to punish him for it.\n\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Stiles murmurs, shifting a little. His arm is like 100% asleep. Derek makes a low, rumbly noise of protest and sort of slumps more heavily onto Stiles. Stiles tries not to love his stupid face. It doesn\u2019t work.\nThe next couple of weeks are uneventful, except that something\u2019s up with Erica.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up with Erica?\u201d Stiles asks Scott. They\u2019re at Scott\u2019s house and Stiles is trying to force some sort of mastery of algebra into Scott\u2019s head. It\u2019s exhausting.\nScott shrugs, glancing down at his phone. \u201cAre you hungry? I could totally eat a pizza right now.\u201d \n\u201cYour mom said she\u2019s cooking,\u201d Stiles says automatically. \u201cYou really didn\u2019t notice anything off about Erica? She\u2019s like, not nearly as, you know, aggressive, as usual.\u201d It\u2019s the nicest possible way of saying that Erica hasn\u2019t been snarling or showing her teeth to anybody lately, which is so abnormal. \n\u201cWhatever,\u201d Scott says. \u201cI haven\u2019t really noticed anything. Are you sure you don\u2019t want pizza? I could totally eat pizza and supper.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up with Erica?\u201d Stiles asks Jackson at practice, that Friday. \n\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d Jackson says flatly, shouldering Stiles a little harder than strictly necessary. It kind of seems like a love tap, but Stiles still gets the message.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up with Erica?\u201d Scott asks Derek the next evening. They\u2019re sitting at the kitchen table drinking hot chocolate, which is frankly hilarious because it\u2019s Derek. The hot chocolate even has mini marshmallows.\n\u201cSomething\u2019s off,\u201d Derek says darkly, because he hasn\u2019t really learned that not everything automatically ends in tragedy. Stiles is trying to teach him, but these things evidently take time.\n\u201cI know!\u201d Stiles says triumphantly. \u201cNobody else believed me!\u201d\n\u201cShe won\u2019t talk to me,\u201d Derek says, sounding frustrated. \n\u201cYeah, maybe because you\u2019re about as responsive as a brick wall,\u201d Stiles says, grinning when Derek tries to kick him. \u201cOkay, okay, you win at feelings,\u201d he says, and steals a spoonful of Derek\u2019s mini marshmallows while he\u2019s distracted, grinning open and honestly at Stiles. Derek steals them back, grabbing Stiles\u2019 spoon and licking it, looking unconcerned. Stiles\u2019 heart feels painfully tight.\n\u201cYou\u2019re good at talking,\u201d Derek says innocently, around the spoon. \n\u201cOh no,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cDefinitely not. Absolutely not. No way, no how.\u201d\nSo that\u2019s how he ends up talking to Erica.\n\u201cI, uh, you, uh, feelings, have them,\u201d Stiles begins. Derek has Stiles and Erica cornered alone in the living room. Derek probably thinks it was very subtle, which it was not. Stiles waits for Erica to do something typical, like try to slam him against a wall or threaten his unborn children or something. It\u2019s kind of a shock when she bursts into tears instead.\n\u201cOh, uh, okay,\u201d Stiles says awkwardly. \u201cUm, you want to talk about it?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re like, so bad at this,\u201d Erica sniffles, but the crying seems to have tapered off as quickly as it began. Stiles offers her a tissue, and Erica blows her nose. \n\u201cSeriously,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cIs everything okay? Even Derek\u2019s worried, and I think that might be one of the signs of the apocalypse.\u201d\nErica laughs, kind of wet and sniffly, but it\u2019s still an improvement. \u201cDo you think Boyd likes me?\u201d she asks suddenly. She looks surprised, like she hadn\u2019t meant to say it. \n\u201cWell yeah,\u201d Stiles says, because he has eyes, and Boyd does too, and uses them mostly for staring at Erica like she\u2019s the best thing he\u2019s ever seen. \u201cBoyd has said probably 20 words in front of me,\u201d Stiles says, \u201cand at least 75% of them were about you. That\u2019s like a ringing endorsement, from him.\u201d\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t said anything to me about it,\u201d Erica says, looking like she kind of hates herself for admitting that she cares. \n\u201cWell yeah,\u201d Stiles says again, because this one\u2019s actually easy. \u201cBoyd\u2019s really shy, and you\u2019re kind of really hot and intimidating. You\u2019re going to have to make the first move, for sure.\u201d\n\u201cBut you think he\u2019ll say yes?\u201d Erica says. She looks a lot better now, like she\u2019s starting to be okay with all of this. Stiles is suddenly, sharply reminded that Erica has no experience with this, that she\u2019s just as lost as Stiles probably would be, if he was considering talking about his feelings instead of just awkwardly cuddling with a hot werewolf.\n\u201cHe\u2019ll say yes,\u201d Stiles says. \n\u201cThanks,\u201d Erica says, sounding kind of surprised that she\u2019s saying it. She pauses, clearly considering, then adds, \u201cDerek\u2019s happier when you\u2019re around.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Stiles says, surprised. \u201cThat, um, that\u2019s good. I\u2019m glad.\u201d\n\u201cWe are too,\u201d Erica says, and she kind of ruffles a hand over his hair before she bounces out of the room.\nIt\u2019s a surprise to exactly nobody that Boyd practically trips over himself in his haste to say yes. Derek pulls Boyd aside to have a pretty hilarious talk, in which he tells Boyd that he won\u2019t stop Erica from ripping his limbs off or something if Boyd hurts her. Boyd nods and then says, \u201cThis is Erica we\u2019re talking about, I\u2019m kind of more worried about her eating me alive.\u201d \nDerek nods thoughtfully, and then gives the same talk to Erica. It\u2019s so endearing that Stiles pretty much can\u2019t take it at all. \u201cThey grow up so fast,\u201d he says, when Erica and Boyd have gone off to the movies. Derek cuffs him on the back of the head, but it\u2019s so gentle that it\u2019s almost more like a caress. Stiles tries not to read any of the more obvious things into that, but it\u2019s getting kind of difficult.\nThe next time the pack\u2019s around for training, the sky opens up in a sudden, violent downpour, soaking everyone. The training devolves into a mud-fight almost immediately, and even Derek rolls around in it a little, barking out a sharp, surprised laugh when he slips into a tussle between Scott and Jackson. Erica drags Stiles into the middle of the pile, and he\u2019s protesting but really he doesn\u2019t mind at all, because he ends up pressed close to the warmth of Derek\u2019s chest, rolling around until they\u2019re all absolutely filthy. \nEveryone takes off to get cleaned up, but Stiles has very important research things to discuss with Derek. So, it only makes sense to accept when Derek says, sounding kind of shy and unsure, \u201cYou could just shower here.\u201d Scott\u2019s raising his eyebrows at Stiles, and it\u2019s a problem if Scott\u2019s becoming aware of things. But Stiles can\u2019t bring himself to slog home all cold and disgusting, so he just pretends not to see. \nThere are three working bathrooms in the house, but Stiles ends up in Derek\u2019s, because Isaac\u2019s is kind of gross, and the downstairs one is cramped and still smells sterile. Derek\u2019s is warm and inviting, and smells a little bit like his body-wash, more so when Stiles uses some of it, sighing contentedly as he sloughs off the mud. The water pressure is sinfully good. \nHe hears the bathroom door open, freezes for a second but then relaxes because it can really only be Derek. Stiles chooses not to consider why Derek\u2019s presence doesn\u2019t concern him. He can just barely make out the cut of Derek\u2019s shoulders through the shower curtain, a dark blur against the warm light of the bathroom. He smells freshly showered, though Stiles isn\u2019t sure how he can tell through the hazy scent of soap that\u2019s already surrounding him. He hears Derek reaching for something, the clink of his toothbrush and the sound of him turning the tap on. It should be weird, it should be so, so weird, but instead it just feels comfortable. Stiles wishes off-handedly that Derek had climbed in the shower with him instead, but that\u2019s more approaching fantasy than reality, so he\u2019ll take this quiet companionship instead. \nWhen he finally gets out of the shower, he sees that Derek has left a pile of folded up clothes for him. That\u2019s kind of really nice, and Stiles can\u2019t help but press the cotton t-shirt to his nose and inhale the earthy, pleasant smell of Derek. He hates himself a little bit, but Derek\u2019s the one who\u2019s being all thoughtful and clothes-leaving-y, and Stiles can\u2019t help if he takes that thought to its logical conclusion and wonders how Derek will feel about Stiles wearing his clothes. He shakes his head hard, trying to clear it, and puts the stupid outfit on.\nThe weather\u2019s starting to get cool, but when Stiles makes it downstairs he finds that it\u2019s pleasantly warm. Derek\u2019s getting something out of the oven, chicken pot pie, which is just awesome. Stiles wanders through the doorway to tell him so, and he\u2019s rewarded by one of Derek\u2019s rare, honest smiles. Stiles gives it right back to him, and tries not to melt through the floor. \nThey end up in the living room, curled up on the couch. Isaac shows up a few minutes later, evidently drawn out of his room by the smell of food. He grins widely at Stiles, then shoves him over and takes a seat at the end of the couch, leaving Stiles half in Derek\u2019s lap. Derek raises an eyebrow at both of them, like he doesn\u2019t understand their shenanigans but won\u2019t have any of it, then shifts so that Stiles is leaning more easily against him. Stiles doesn\u2019t really know what to do, but he\u2019s too comfortable to move, and besides, Isaac is taking up an unreasonable amount of the couch. Werewolves think they\u2019re so subtle, but they\u2019re really, really not. \nLater, when they\u2019re done eating and Derek is puttering around in the kitchen, Isaac grabs Stiles\u2019 arm and drags him out into the hallway, out of earshot. \n\u201cYou smell like him,\u201d Isaac says. \n\u201cI, uh, used his shower stuff,\u201d Stiles says awkwardly. This conversation is seriously the worst.\n\u201cYou always smell like him,\u201d Isaac counters, and before Stiles can reply, he adds, \u201cHe likes it. We can all tell. You like it too.\u201d\n\u201cUm,\u201d Stiles says. There is seriously no better response available to him.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Isaac says, and his face softens, like he can tell how uncomfortable Stiles is. Well good on him, Stiles probably reeks of discomfort. \u201cWe want him to be happy,\u201d Isaac says quietly. \u201cHe was never very happy, before this.\u201d\n\u201cAnd he is now?\u201d Stiles asks, surprised out of his awkwardness.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Isaac says, and somehow, it sounds like he\u2019s giving his permission, which is ridiculous on so many levels. \u201cNow he is. But remember what you told Erica, about Boyd?\u201d \nStiles nods. He knows exactly where this is going, because he\u2019s not an idiot.\n\u201cWell Derek\u2019s like that too,\u201d Isaac says, like that isn\u2019t patently obvious. \u201cHe\u2019s actually worse, I think.\u201d\n\u201cWell yeah,\u201d Stiles can\u2019t restrain himself from saying.\nIsaac huffs out a laugh. \u201cJust, just know that you make him, uh,\u201d Isaac is kind of blushing, now. \u201cYou make him feel that way,\u201d Isaac finishes, and looks up through his lashes at Stiles. He seems like way more than a year younger than Stiles, open and vulnerable. It makes Stiles\u2019 heart clench in his chest.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he says, clearing his throat awkwardly. \u201cNoted.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Isaac agrees. \n\u201cHey assholes, \u201cDerek calls from the kitchen, not sounding at all annoyed. \u201cRinse your plates off.\u201d\nStiles just has to love him, because how could he not?\n\u201cSo,\u201d Stiles says, the next time he\u2019s alone with Scott. \u201cDo you think Derek\u2019s into me?\u201d\n\u201cInto you?\u201d Scott asks, weighting the words significantly.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles says, uncomfortable. \u201cYou know, into me.\u201d\nScott\u2019s face clears. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says, like it\u2019s obvious. \u201cI\u2019m just pretty surprised that you don\u2019t already know that. \u201c \nIt\u2019s a valid point. If Scott has it figured out before Stiles does, that\u2019s definitely saying something. Stiles abruptly remembers that they\u2019re talking about Derek liking him, and freaks out. \n\u201cDude, your pulse,\u201d Scott says. \u201cAre you having like a heart attack or something?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles chokes out, \u201cI\u2019m just fine.\u201d He is not just fine. \n\u201cOkay,\u201d Scott says, seeming satisfied with that non-explanation. He goes back to staring at Allison\u2019s Facebook. \u201cGood talk, bro.\u201d\n\u201cUh huh,\u201d Stiles says absently, because Derek likes him.\nStiles doesn\u2019t turn up at the Hale house over the next couple days, because he\u2019s extremely busy trying to figure out how he can look at Derek without blurting out a lot of really embarrassing things about feelings and how he wants to maybe lick Derek\u2019s face. In movies this kind of shit is easy. They like each other, so it should be as simple as that. They should be able to run through a rainstorm into each other\u2019s arms, or maybe a field of daisies or something. Okay, perhaps Stiles has been watching too much Lifetime, but he\u2019s in serious need of guidance, here. Derek is Derek, though. He has the total package of issues, and Stiles is just about driving himself crazy with all the ways Derek could say no, all because Derek is too damaged to think this is something he can have.\n\u201cJust talk to him,\u201d Allison advises him, when Stiles breaks down and calls her. \n\u201cIs that how you got Scott to ask you out?\u201d Stiles asks.\n\u201cNah,\u201d Allison says. \u201cScott\u2019s not great at that kind of up-front communication.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you think Derek\u2019s any better?\u201d Stiles asks, incredulously.\n\u201cHmm,\u201d Allison says, conceding the point. \u201cMaybe you could bake him something. Everyone likes cookies.\u201d\nHe could, except they had totally baked cookies last weekend, because Derek probably hadn\u2019t done it since before his life was tragic, and Isaac maybe never had. They\u2019d eaten way too many chocolate chips and Derek had rubbed a little bit of cookie dough off Stiles\u2019 cheek and licked it off his own fingertip while looking softly down at Stiles, so warm it hurt. Derek is never going to say anything.\n\u201cNot interested,\u201d Lydia says, when Stiles tries her. \u201cBut I\u2019m thinking you could just keep doing whatever you\u2019re doing. He\u2019s pretty obsessed with you.\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t help, if he won\u2019t do anything about it,\u201d Stiles half-wails, throwing himself down on his bed in a fit of pique.\n\u201cUh huh,\u201d Lydia says, and apparently the conversation is over.\nIt becomes evident that things are getting bad when the entire rest of the pack shows up at Stiles\u2019 front door.\n\u201cYou made him sad,\u201d Isaac says, sounding betrayed. He pushes Stiles out of the way and Boyd and Erica troop through the door, Jackson following them, looking like it\u2019s under extreme duress. \n\u201cHe keeps training us,\u201d Boyd says. \u201cLike in the middle of the night. I\u2019m a working guy, I can\u2019t be doing laps at 2 AM.\u201d\n\u201cHe never smiles anymore,\u201d Isaac says. \u201cWhen you were around he smiled.\u201d He manages to make it sound like Stiles is the absolute worst, which he kind of already feels, so that\u2019s just great.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be here,\u201d Jackson says stiffly. \u201cBut this has to stop. I can\u2019t do any more push-ups.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll bite your face,\u201d Erica says. \u201cI will, and it will hurt.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Stiles says, hating them all. \u201cI just don\u2019t know how to talk to him.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been talking to Derek all along!\u201d Erica says, throwing her hands up in disgust. \u201cFigure it out!\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d Stiles says flatly, and shoves them all out the door.\n\u201cUm, kid?\u201d Stiles\u2019 dad says from behind him. Seriously? His life is genuinely the worst. \u201cDerek as in Hale?\u201d\n\u201cUm,\u201d Stiles says miserably. \u201cI guess we should talk.\u201d\nHis dad lets him babble on for a good half hour, until Stiles is pretty much exhausted. His dad has the bottle of whiskey out, but he\u2019s only had one shot, which is not too bad.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d his dad says quellingly, taking pity on him. \u201cNow, I know I absolutely should not be approving of this, given many very, very good reasons.\u201d He pauses, eyeing the whiskey, before continuing. \u201cBut you\u2019ve been happy, kid. I haven\u2019t seen you happy like this in years, since-\u201d His dad cuts off, but Stiles knows what he\u2019s saying. He swallows around the lump in his throat, because if his dad really sees that, then this is a bigger deal than even Stiles thought.\n\u201cIf he makes you happy,\u201d Stiles\u2019 dad says haltingly. \u201cHe does make you happy, right? Nothing you, uh, don\u2019t want to be doing?\u201d\n\u201cDad,\u201d Stiles says, ending that line of thought for hopefully forever.\n\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d he says, putting his hands up. \u201cOkay. Then I guess you just need to be the brave one, son. That boy\u2019s been through a lot of hurt. I can see why he wouldn\u2019t want to open himself up for more.\u201d\n\u201cFiiiine,\u201d Stiles says, but he can\u2019t help grinning a little. It\u2019s still unbelievably, all-encompassingly scary, but his dad being okay with it, that helps.\n\u201cWell,\u201d his dad says. \u201cGo make your big move. Don\u2019t ever tell me gory details, or else I might have to show Derek my weapons, which nobody will enjoy.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Stiles says, \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d his dad echoes, but before Stiles can go, he gets up and hugs him, over the table. \u201cBe safe.\u201d\n\u201cUgh,\u201d Stiles says, but he hugs him back.\nWhat seemed like a reasonably solid plan dissolves into nothing during the short drive to the Hale house. Stiles never actually worked out what he was going to say, and since talking to Derek is the entirety of the plan, that sucks. \u201cBe the brave one,\u201d Stiles mutters to himself. Well, Derek did say that he was good at talking. Stiles guesses he\u2019ll just have to use his skills. \nIt\u2019s dark by the time he arrives, but the house looks invitingly warm, light shining out through the windows. Stiles can make out the muted warmth of the living room, and the smaller, brighter square of the kitchen door, through which he can see a hunched form slumped over at the table. It\u2019s clearly Derek, because only he can brood with that level of skill and determination. Stiles tells his stupid heart to stop pounding, and gets out of the jeep, rubbing his clammy hands against his jeans. Ugh. Being the brave one is hard.\nHe doesn\u2019t go in through the front door, because that way lies a pack of angry werewolves, and honestly nothing is worth braving their collective disappointment. He cuts around to the kitchen door instead, opening it gently so as not to startle Derek. \nSomehow he still manages to, which is weird because Derek usually knows he\u2019s coming from like a literal mile away. Derek does an obvious double-take at the sight of him, though, and it kind of breaks Stiles\u2019 heart to see the way Derek shrinks back into himself, like he needs a shield. \n\u201cHey,\u201d he says quietly, raising an awkward hand.\n\u201cHi,\u201d Derek says gruffly, pointedly not looking at him.\n\u201cSorry I haven\u2019t been around much,\u201d Stiles offers. \u201cI had some stuff to figure out.\u201d\nDerek looks up at him, then, like he can\u2019t seem to help it. \u201cOh,\u201d he says, with absolutely no inflection. He really isn\u2019t going to make this easy.\nStiles takes a deep breath, considers, and then says fuck it and just starts talking. \u201cSo, the thing is,\u201d he says, not really thinking at all, \u201cYou like me.\u201d\nDerek makes a noise, like he\u2019s going to deny it, like he thinks it could come back to haunt him if he doesn\u2019t.\n\u201cNo, shut up,\u201d Stiles says impatiently. \u201cYou like me, and obviously I like you too. You could probably smell it on me, if you got your head out of that perpetual cloud of misery or whatever. Everyone else we know is well aware of it.\u201d He holds up a hand as Derek tries to say something again, looking hunted. \u201cNope, I\u2019m not done. No arguments until I\u2019m done.\u201d\nIt feels like a long-shot, but Derek subsides, slumping back down against the table.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you have a lot of reasons why this won\u2019t work, okay? I get it. I really do. But people are saying they can\u2019t remember the last time I was as happy as I am with you, okay? And you? Nobody even knew you had the physical ability to smile, but you do when I\u2019m around. That means something. We\u2019re good together.\u201d Stiles pauses, because that all came out really fast and he needs to catch his breath.\nDerek puts his head up, like he wants to say something. His face looks like Stiles doesn\u2019t think he has ever seen it before, open, and wow, hopeful.\n\u201cAre you going to tell me why this can\u2019t work?\u201d Stiles asks.\nDerek shakes his head no.\n\u201cAny other complaints or problems?\u201d \nDerek shakes his head again.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Stiles says, \u201cThen what?\u201d\n\u201cStiles,\u201d Derek says, and his name comes out choked, like he\u2019s trying not to growl it, or even sob it maybe. \u201cCome here.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Stiles says, and his pulse goes up, just like that, just on those three words. He stumbles over to Derek, closing the distance between them.\nDerek reaches out and puts his hands on Stiles\u2019 hips. He has this stupid look on his face like he doesn\u2019t quite know what he did to deserve this, and Stiles just really wants to kiss him. \nSo he does. He leans his head down and tilts his mouth toward Derek\u2019s unfairly pretty face, and then they\u2019re kissing, warm and soft and perfect, which is to say, at a very awkward angle that Stiles doesn\u2019t care about in the least.\nDerek makes a noise against his mouth and pulls Stiles down onto his lap, and that\u2019s even better. That\u2019s all heat and a wet slide of tongues, and Derek\u2019s teeth scraping gently against Stiles\u2019 lower lip. It feels too good to be real, seriously.\nStiles pulls back fractionally, because he feels like he\u2019s forgotten how to breathe. He gasps huge lung-fuls, his hands tight on Derek\u2019s shoulders. \u201cOkay,\u201d he says, and it comes out all embarrassing and breathy. \u201cOkay, that\u2019s awesome. That is so awesome.\u201d\nDerek tilts their foreheads together, looking up at Stiles. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cYeah, it is.\u201d His arms tighten, one around Stiles\u2019 waist, the other draped across his back. \u201cDon\u2019t go away again.\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cAt least, not if you can promise that\u2019s going to keep happening. That really needs to keep happening.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to happen a lot,\u201d Derek says, \u201cAs long as you want it to.\u201d\nThat\u2019s too cute for words, that Derek\u2019s still not sure that Stiles really wants him, so then Stiles has to kiss him some more, and there might be some pretty inappropriate grinding, especially in a kitchen when other people are in the next room over. So, of course that\u2019s when everyone chooses to barge in, because Stiles is surrounded by complete assholes.\n\u201cAre daddy and daddy still fighting?\u201d Erica asks, sounding altogether too amused. \n\u201cAm I going to have to sleep on Stiles\u2019 floor on the weekends?\u201d Isaac says. \u201cIs it because you don\u2019t love me enough?\u201d\n\u201cYou guys are the worst,\u201d Stiles says, but he can\u2019t stop grinning, because Derek isn\u2019t trying to shove him off his lap. In fact he seems to be holding Stiles even tighter, like he\u2019s afraid Stiles might go away. How bossy, and adorable.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about any of this,\u201d Jackson says, like he\u2019s really worried that they think he might have grown a heart or something. \n\u201cSure you don\u2019t,\u201d Boyd says, and grabs him and Isaac by the scruffs of their necks. \u201cWe\u2019re going to watch a movie now,\u201d he says significantly, like he\u2019s daring any of them to argue, and everyone shuffles out and leaves them alone again. \n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen your room,\u201d Stiles says, because he is awesome at hinting. \nDerek looks amused. \u201cDo you want to see my room?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re actually the worst at this,\u201d Stiles says, but it\u2019s hard to say it seriously when he physically cannot stop kissing Derek all over his face.\n\u201cThat\u2019s probably true,\u201d Derek admits, and Stiles tries to piss him off some more, until Derek puts his annoyingly big muscles to use and carries Stiles up the stairs. It\u2019s a nice room, but Derek is much nicer, in a variety of ways.\nNext weekend, on movie night, everyone shuffles around until Derek and Stiles are sitting together, and Derek puts his arm around Stiles. Stiles just leans into it, because sometimes things really are that easy. \n\u201cYou guys are gross,\u201d Scott says, but he doesn\u2019t mean it at all. \n\u201cYou\u2019re grosser,\u201d Erica says, but she really can\u2019t talk, because Boyd\u2019s head is on her knee, and she looks hilariously happy about it. Scott throws his arm around Isaac companionably, and Isaac grins and elbows him affectionately. Lydia makes a face until Jackson moves over for her, and Allison pushes her way in on Lydia's other side, laughing. Derek wraps his big, warm hand around the base of Stiles\u2019 neck, and Stiles realizes, distant through his contentment, that somehow they\u2019ve built themselves a family."
