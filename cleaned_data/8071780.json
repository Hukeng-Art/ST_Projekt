    "notes": "<p>many, many thanks to mechanical-orange for beta-ing this for me! also i haven\u2019t read the comics and so they aren\u2019t officially \u201ccanon\u201d for this story, but i did pick and choose parts of them to incorporate, essentially wherever they would suit my purposes, and then discarded what didn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>okay so in truth i intended this to be a one-shot, and then it ballooned out of my control so i said it would be a three-shot and then it continued to balloon out of my control, but i truly do believe that the next part will wrap it up.</p>\n<p>This chapter was hard for me to write. At first, I was too anxious about the upcoming election, and then it actually happened and I was too devastated to consider writing fanfiction. But then I stopped and thought about it, about the role of fiction in helping us -- both writer and reader -- process emotion, about how it teaches us how to get into the head of another person, about how cathartic it can be, how hopeful. And then I received a review where the person mentioned how important this story -- this Katara -- is to them, particularly after the election, how it lifted their spirits to see her being independent and strong and fearless.</p>\n<p>All of this led me to restart this chapter and take it in a slightly different direction than I had planned, to delve into a lot of the things I'm feeling and I've heard from others about what they're feeling. I have, here, established a politician-Katara who stands for all that we lost on Tuesday, and who -- if she were real and living in America now -- would never for a second consider giving up. She would stand and fight and never be silenced.</p>\n<p>And so I want to say -- if you're afraid right now, if you're hurting, if you're worried about the future, you are not alone. Don't give up hope, and don't lose faith. Not in yourself, and not in other other people. It seems insurmountable, it feels like things are going in an awful direction, and I'm not going to pretend that it's all magically going to be okay. But I am going to promise that you aren't alone. However alone you feel, however silenced, however afraid -- you are not alone. </p>\n<p>Let us come together, let us take Katara's words to heart, and never, ever turn our backs on people who need us. We need each other now more than ever. Stand together, hang in there, and hold on. It isn't okay now, but we will make it be okay in the future. Just hold on.</p>\n<p>If you ever need someone to talk to, send me a message. I can't promise that I'll have answers, but I will have a listening ear and a shoulder to cry on. And never, ever, ever, ever forget, I cannot stress this enough: <b>you are not alone.</b></p>",
    "text": "act one: this will be my last confession ('i love you' never felt like any blessing)\n.\n.\nKatara sits at the temple under the tree while Aang teaches his new people and tries her hardest to be content, but something inside boils and burns and seeps into her bones, and the thought falls into her head almost of its own accord.\nWhat if she just\u2026 left? Surely he would notice, right?\nSo she leaves, without fuss or fanfare, and wanders around the temple for a while that turns into a long while that turns into a very long while that settles on her heavily.\nAfter two hours, she begins packing.\nAfter three, she goes back to the tree, to see the crowd a little more dispersed, apparently beginning meditation, and Aang there among them, helping adjust this acolyte\u2019s back and that acolyte\u2019s arms. And she has a vision of her future, which is this.\nJust\u2026 this, all the time. Standing off to the side, unnoticed, apart. Of course, Katara can\u2019t really contribute to the Air Acolyte\u2019s lessons, so it\u2019s not as though she could be doing anything else, except everything that isn\u2019t right here. She could be doing something, helping people at least, and instead she\u2019s sitting here \u2013 chained to Aang, useless.\nIt is, very suddenly, not enough to be with him. She isn\u2019t sure it ever was, or if she was simply so desperate to be the person he saw when he looked at her \u2013 angelic, perfect, beautiful and shining and pure \u2013 that she stuffed all of the things that didn\u2019t fit in with him and his schedule for their future down deep into her heart, and convinced herself that this was love.\nBut it\u2019s so clear and so solid and so cold, that this is not where she should be. It\u2019s taken nearly two years to come to this point, but it\u2019s like she\u2019s suddenly fallen off a cliff she\u2019s refused to see coming: she does not belong here.\n\u201cHey, Katara!\u201d Aang says, coming over to her, bouncing and bright and for a moment her resolve falters because he is so unaware that she is going to shatter him and she doesn\u2019t want to break him like this, but it\u2019s just not working. She loves him, she wants the best for him, but she also wants the best for herself, and this is not it, even a little bit. But at the same time, he looks so innocent and happy, and as sure as she knows herself, she knows: she is going to smile and nod and go along with it and ignore this little epiphany \u2013 until: \u201cDid you like the lesson today?\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t even notice that she was gone for three hours.\nIt\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s not like it\u2019s evil, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s a terrible thing. He was simply so engrossed in teaching the Air Acolytes and bettering the world that he never thought to look up to see if she was there. It doesn\u2019t make him a bad person, but it does make Katara certain that this is not how she wants to live.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t here, Aang,\u201d she hears herself saying, a bit distant, almost like she\u2019s watching the scene unfold as though they\u2019re actors on a stage. She can hear the audience begging her not to do it, but her story ends here if she doesn\u2019t. He looks confused, and she sighs. \u201cI\u2026 I can\u2019t do this, Aang. I\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t just sit here and watch you all day, doing nothing.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 welcome to join,\u201d he starts hesitantly, so confused.\n\u201cI\u2019m not an Air Acolyte, Aang, and I don\u2019t want to be. I\u2019m Water Tribe, and I\u2019m going home.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d he says, worrying his lip. \u201cI\u2019ll get my things \u2013 \u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d she cuts him off. \u201cDon\u2019t. You\u2019re doing great things here, the Acolytes need you, and the world needs you and them.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I need you,\u201d he says earnestly, and it tugs at her and twists at her but she can\u2019t do this anymore.\n\u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d she replies. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even notice that I wasn\u2019t here. I\u2019m not criticizing you!\u201d she cuts in suddenly, seeing him opening his mouth to retort. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. You\u2019re a teacher, and you were focused on your students. That\u2019s a good thing. But you don\u2019t need me.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be with me anymore?\u201d he asks in such a small voice that it threatens to dwarf her. She hesitates, and closes her eyes, and her resolves stiffens from coal to diamond.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to spend the rest of my life sitting off to the side, watching you and doing nothing. I don\u2019t belong here, Aang. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to stay here \u2013 \u201d\n\u201cAang!\u201d she cries, because can\u2019t he see that he\u2019s making this worse? But then she thinks that no, no he probably can\u2019t. Aang has never exactly been the best at seeing the world through other people\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou belong here. This is where you are doing so much for the world. But I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not doing anything except following you around. This isn\u2019t what I want, this isn\u2019t the life that I want.\u201d\nThe audience in her mind weeps, and curses her for her cruelty, but this is no one else\u2019s story.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve done plenty!\u201d he says, and she shakes her head.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ve been your girlfriend, that\u2019s all. I think\u2026 I think we shouldn\u2019t have gotten together in the first place,\u201d she sighs, and he looks so hurt that she can\u2019t look at him anymore. \u201cWe weren\u2019t ready. I wasn\u2019t ready, but I felt like I was\u2026 supposed to. Like it was my destiny. Maybe in the future,\u201d she concedes. \u201cMaybe then we can\u2026 work together. But this isn\u2019t a partnership, Aang. Neither of us know how to be.\u201d\nShe\u2019s lying, a bit \u2013 she thinks she could probably figure it out a lot better than he can \u2013 but it makes it seem less like it\u2019s all his fault.\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d he stammers, and she has reached the breaking point within the breaking point, and she cannot stand to do this anymore.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she repeats, choking back tears, and leaves. He calls after her, but she ignores him.\n.\nShe makes a stop in Kyoshi, but Suki is in the Fire Nation, being Zuko\u2019s bodyguard, so the only person she really knows is Ty Lee. And it\u2019s not like they\u2019re friends, or like she wants to confide in the other girl at all, but when she steps off the boat, alone, Ty Lee locks eyes with her and seems to know.\n\u201cTell me,\u201d she gasps, leaning forward and taking her hand. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\nShe spent most of the boat ride crying alone in her room and feeling like The World\u2019s Worst Person \u2013 not helped by the glares she started receiving as soon as word got around who she was and what she did to the Avatar \u2013 so she\u2019s all out of tears.\n\u201cI broke up with Aang,\u201d she says, without inflection or emotion. \u201cI told him that I didn\u2019t want to be an Air Acolyte, and I left. Like a coward,\u201d she adds to herself, miserably.\nShe\u2019s been veering wildly between regret and relief, and she\u2019s landed hard on the regret side this morning. But Ty Lee, for all of her bubbliness, seems to see things differently than other people.\n\u201cYour aura is all one color,\u201d she replies slowly, apropos of nothing, and Katara furrows her brow, confused, so she goes on. \u201cIt\u2019s blue, which means you\u2019re sad, but it\u2019s not conflicted. You were always conflicted before.\u201d\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say anything?\u201d she asks quietly, face burning with shame from so many directions she isn\u2019t even sure where to start untangling it. Ty Lee makes a face.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t want to know,\u201d she answers, and shrugs, pulling her along with her into a small, one-room house that must be hers. \u201cI have a policy of not telling people things they don\u2019t want to know, especially if it\u2019s about themselves. Wait here,\u201d she adds, plopping Katara down at a little table and going over to a big box with a door, opening it and pulling something out.\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d she asks, and Ty Lee glances back at her before shutting the door and beginning to rummage through a drawer.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an icebox. Your brother came up with it! It\u2019s really smart, he had this idea about storing food on ice to make it last longer, and I got the first prototype. Well, actually,\u201d she adds thoughtfully, looking up, \u201cSuki got the first one but then she had to leave for the Fire Nation so she gave it to me. It\u2019s great, and it means that I can have things like this!\u201d\nShe whirls around and brandishes a bucket of\u2026 something, with two spoons. Katara, who has never been fully at-ease around Ty Lee on the best of days, is on immediate alert, but she just sighs.\n\u201cIt\u2019s ice cream, Katara,\u201d she sighs, shaking her head and walking over to the table and setting the bucket in the middle of it. \u201cIt\u2019s made with vanilla and matcha and cream, it\u2019s amazing.\u201d She holds a spoon out to her. \u201cHere.\u201d\nKatara hesitates, but then\u2026 word got around so quickly that she broke the Avatar\u2019s heart, and she\u2019s received a lot of ugly glares in the couple of short stops between the Air Temple and Kyoshi, and a lot of stony silence from the people on the boat.\nTy Lee is the first person who has been on her side.\nShe takes the spoon, and gingerly scoops up a little of the stuff and tastes it.\nIt is good.\n\u201cRight?\u201d Ty Lee gushes. \u201cI\u2019ve been experimenting with flavors, but this is my favorite so far. It\u2019s the perfect cure for heartache. Well, except wine, but this is healthier.\u201d\nShe\u2019s not sure if it\u2019s the ice cream or the friendship, but she does feel a lot better already.\n\u201cI just\u2026 wasn\u2019t happy with him,\u201d she sighs, as though Ty Lee asked. \u201cI tried so hard to convince myself I was, but it never\u2026 worked.\u201d\n\u201cI understand,\u201d she replies, taking a big bite of the ice cream herself. \u201cSometimes you try your best not to hurt someone, but then it all comes out and you end up hurting them more than you would have if you\u2019d just been honest from the start.\u201d Ty Lee sighs. \u201cI wish I had advice, but I don\u2019t know how to fix it.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t need advice,\u201d she says honestly, clenching her jaw and blinking back tears. \u201cI know I did the right thing, eventually. We shouldn\u2019t have gotten together in the first place,\u201d she mutters, and Ty Lee gives her a thoughtful look.\n\u201cNo,\u201d she muses. \u201cYou needed to learn what you wanted and didn\u2019t want out of a relationship. I don\u2019t believe that any love is wasted, even if it goes bad. You learned a lot about yourself, and you had fun, right? It\u2019s worth it, then. Even if the end sucks.\u201d\n\u201cNo offense, but when did you become the Relationship Guru?\u201d\nTy Lee laughs. \u201cSince I had to coach Mai through her and Zuko\u2019s last breakup, and then her whole fling with Kei Lo. And I\u2019ve had a couple of relationships myself, nothing as serious as you and Aang, but I know how much breakups suck, even if you know you did the right thing.\u201d\nKatara pauses, taking a bite of the ice cream and savoring it for a long time. \u201cYou know,\u201d she says finally, quietly, \u201cyou\u2019re the first person who hasn\u2019t hated me for breaking his heart.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about everyone else,\u201d Ty Lee replies seriously. \u201cYou made the best choice for yourself. They\u2019ll come around or they won\u2019t, but you shouldn\u2019t wait for them to get on with your life.\u201d\n\u201cI just feel like\u2026\u201d she starts, still half-caught between that swing of regret and relief, \u201cI feel like it was sudden, you know? Maybe we could have worked it out, but it was like\u2026 all of a sudden, I couldn\u2019t stand it anymore.\u201d\n\u201cThe lies we tell ourselves are the ones that hurt us the most when they break down,\u201d Ty Lee says, as though quoting someone. \u201cYour aura was always so close to you, and muddled. It wasn\u2019t a healthy aura.\u201d\n\u201cIs it healthy now?\u201d\nTy Lee tilts her head. \u201cIt\u2019s healthier than it was before. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong that time won\u2019t fix,\u201d she adds, as though she\u2019s a healer diagnosing Katara\u2019s death rattle as \u201ca little cough, just rest up and you\u2019ll be fine in a jiffy\u201d.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Aang will ever forgive me.\u201d\n\u201cGive him time,\u201d Ty Lee says sympathetically. \u201cYou\u2019ll see. It\u2019ll all be okay.\u201d\nKatara, in spite of herself, smiles.\n.\nIt\u2019s surprisingly hard for her to leave Kyoshi the next morning, and she finds herself giving Ty Lee \u2013 Ty Lee! of the Fire Nation! that girl who stole her bending that one time! \u2013 a hug before she gets on the boat.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she says, feeling a little ashamed and a lot weak. \u201cI really needed to talk to someone about it.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re always welcome here!\u201d Ty Lee chirps, hugging her back tightly. \u201cI love having friends over, and you\u2019ll have to help me make ice cream one of these days.\u201d\nKatara laughs a bit. \u201cI will. Keep in touch.\u201d\n\u201cYou too!\u201d\nShe gets on the boat feeling lighter than she has in, if she\u2019s being honest with herself, nearly two years. Ty Lee\u2019s words echo in her head \u2013 It\u2019ll all be okay, and Don\u2019t worry about everyone else.\nShe holds them close to her like a shield, and goes back home.\n.\nSokka welcomes her into the city with worry all over his face.\n\u201cKatara, what happened?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cNothing,\u201d she answers, and it\u2019s truer than he knows. \u201cNothing happened, and I left.\u201d She sighs, and it\u2019s the opposite of yesterday with Ty Lee, when she couldn\u2019t stop the words from pouring out of her mouth; she does not want to open up to Sokka right now. \u201cWhat needs doing down here?\u201d\nHe watches her for a moment before apparently deciding not to push, and scratches the back of his head. \u201cWell, we just got a shipment of marble in from the Earth Kingdom, Toph came along to help us build the pavilion. You can definitely help us there.\u201d\n\u201cWhat kind of pavilion?\u201d she asks, already walking past him and dreading seeing Toph; if Ty Lee could tell she was lying to herself from her aura, who knows what secrets Toph knows.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Sokka starts, \u201cwe were thinking about a meeting place, I can show you the blueprints. Someplace where everyone can congregate and discuss politics, you know?\u201d\n\u201cRight, like a town hall.\u201d\n\u201cPretty much, but we also want it to be, like, a place where people can go and learn about the tribe and the world and stuff. Dad wants to hire a painter to paint a bunch of cool things from history and hang them on the walls, but wow they do not come cheap.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to start off asking for all the paintings at once,\u201d she chides, smiling a little.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Sokka says, drawing out the word like he really doesn\u2019t like the suggestion. \u201cBut how lame would it look, one really nice painting and then a bunch of blank wall space like, hey we know there\u2019s nothing actually here right now, but just wait!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a work in progress,\u201d she laughs. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what we all really are?\u201d\nBut he isn\u2019t convinced, and anyway, she sees his point, and so she mulls it over for most of the walk to the skeletal frame of what will be the town hall, someday, until she sees a couple of children playing by a fire pit, and the idea strikes.\n\u201cWhat about a mural?\u201d she asks, and Sokka looks at her quizzically, so she goes on. \u201cThe kids,\u201d she prompts, gesturing to them. \u201cGet the kids to paint the wall with pictures of things they know, or like. They don\u2019t have to paint all of it \u2013 in fact, it\u2019s better if they don\u2019t, because then the next generation can add on to it. It\u2019s still a work in progress,\u201d she adds, the inspiration coming over her like a warm blanket, \u201cbut it\u2019s supposed to be. It\u2019s always looking toward the future.\u201d\nSokka thinks about that for a moment, then nods slowly. \u201cI think you\u2019re on to something here,\u201d he says, and opens the door, in spite of the unfinished walls. She thinks privately that that says a lot about the kind of person her brother is. \u201cBecause, like, we\u2019re the ones building it, but it\u2019s really for them, the next generation. So they get to paint it. I like it.\u201d\nA warm glow invades her chest, but before she can put her finger on why, they meet Toph and the glow abruptly shuts down in the wake of cold dread.\nBut Toph just tilts her head.\n\u201cLong time, no see, Katara!\u201d\n\u201cYou too,\u201d she says warmly, and then groans. \u201cRight, that was a joke.\u201d\n\u201cAnd a greeting, don\u2019t sell me short!\u201d she cries, acting offended, but Katara doesn\u2019t believe a word of it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you,\u201d she drawls instead. \u201cHave you been helping a lot with the city?\u201d\n\u201cNot really,\u201d Toph replies, shrugging. \u201cBut Sokka and Dadkoda wanted marble floors in their palace, I think they\u2019re jealous of Zuko.\u201d\n\u201cIt is not a palace,\u201d Sokka growls, through clenched teeth, and Katara rolls her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s a meeting hall, for the \u2013 \u201d\n\u201cAnd so you got them the marble?\u201d she cuts in, determinedly ignoring Sokka\u2019s sputtering.\n\u201cYep,\u201d Toph says. \u201cEven offered out of the kindness of my heart to come all the way down here \u2013 to the middle of icy nowhere \u2013 to install it for them, free of charge. Because I\u2019m an angel.\u201d\nKatara blinks.\n\u201cYour parents must have been really overbearing,\u201d she deadpans, and Toph makes a face.\n\u201cUgh, you have no idea. I\u2019m never going back.\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that the last time?\u201d Sokka asks airily, but Toph shudders.\n\u201cMom wanted to prep me for a real debut, with a party and dresses and shoes and manners. I don\u2019t know how to break it to her that I\u2019m never getting married.\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say never,\u201d Katara says, and Toph raises an eyebrow.\n\u201cYeah, no. I\u2019m not ever getting married. You\u2019re the one who convinced me of that, Sugar Queen.\u201d\nThis brings her up cold, and even Sokka looks surprised.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she asks hesitantly, and Toph scoffs, crossing her arms.\n\u201cYou stopped being Katara the second you hooked up with Aang,\u201d she replies, and Katara feels her face heating up. \u201cThat\u2019s why you dumped him, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she adds on the last with a bit of hesitancy, like she was all prepared for a good old-fashioned roast but realized belatedly that maybe no one else was with her.\n\u201cDumped is\u2026 a strong word,\u201d she stammers, even though it\u2019s not.\n\u201cWell, he thinks he\u2019s been dumped, so if you\u2019re planning to get back together, you know, do\u2026 that.\u201d Toph sounds a little let-down, and terribly awkward, and Katara looks away.\n\u201cI\u2019m not getting back with him,\u201d she mutters. \u201cBecause\u2026 yeah, you\u2019re right.\u201d There\u2019s more, about how she felt like she was just being dragged along with destiny, and how she spent the last year and a half feeling like an accessory, but she doesn\u2019t really want to open up to Toph right now, either.\n\u201cGood,\u201d Toph says firmly. \u201cYou were disappearing.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d she mumbles, and isn\u2019t sure she believes it. \u201cI was.\u201d\n.\n\u201cI mean,\u201d Sokka says to her later that night, holding out a cup of tea and taking a seat with her by the fire, \u201cToph was right. You weren\u2019t really yourself when you were with Aang.\u201d\nShe takes the tea and allows him to sit by her. He\u2019s been treating her like she\u2019s about to shatter all day, ever since Toph made that comment about not getting married, and she doesn\u2019t really know how to respond.\nKatara has always been the rock. She doesn\u2019t know how to be the person who needs support; it\u2019s uncomfortable and awkward, and she wishes Sokka would just leave well enough alone.\nBut he won\u2019t abandon his baby sister.\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t anyone tell me?\u201d\nSokka sighs, and shrugs expansively. \u201cYou seemed happy,\u201d he says, but almost like it\u2019s a question. \u201cAnd anytime someone said or did anything to Aang you didn\u2019t like, you just blew up at them, nobody wanted to make you angry.\u201d\n\u201cI was angry,\u201d she says, empty of emotion. \u201cAt myself, more than anything. I was angry because I wasn\u2019t happy and I thought I was supposed to be. Everyone said I was supposed to be, but I wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Sokka asks quietly, and she heaves a sigh.\n\u201cI just\u2026\u201d she starts, unsure how to word it \u2013 when she\u2019d been talking to Ty Lee, she\u2019d barely had to say anything, and Ty Lee hadn\u2019t pressed her for details. Because, she thinks traitorously, Ty Lee actually knew how to talk to someone who was going through a rough breakup, whereas Sokka is clueless on that front. \u201cI had this moment where I realized I didn\u2019t belong there. He was teaching all his new Acolytes and I was just sitting off to the side and I realized that if I didn\u2019t leave now, this was where I\u2019d be for the rest of my life. And I didn\u2019t want that.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s really confused,\u201d Sokka says, as though easing out onto a precarious branch. \u201cHe thought everything was going perfectly. He was, um,\u201d he coughs and winces. \u201cHe had a pendant all carved for you. He doesn\u2019t know why you left.\u201d\n\u201cOf course he doesn\u2019t,\u201d another voice interjects, and Toph takes the other seat by Katara. \u201cYou spent all that time protecting him from the world, he has no idea how to take a hit. You always told him it was never his fault.\u201d\nHer own words, when she\u2019d left him, rise up in her mind at that, how desperate she\u2019d been to make him think he wasn\u2019t to blame.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t his fault,\u201d she says, a bit obstinately, because she\u2019s bristling at Toph\u2019s tone. \u201cIt was mine, I wasn\u2019t \u2013 \u201d\n\u201cIt was both of yours,\u201d Toph cuts in. \u201cYou weren\u2019t right for each other, you just enabled each other\u2019s worst tendencies. Both of you were in the wrong.\u201d\nShe doesn\u2019t have a good response to that, so for a while she says nothing. Finally, she sighs again and runs a hand through her hair. \u201cIt seems like everyone knew we weren\u2019t right for each other, except us.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that,\u201d Sokka says slowly. \u201cI mean, when you first got together, I thought it\u2019d be great, but you just\u2026 weren\u2019t yourself. It was weird.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re lying if you say that you didn\u2019t know you and Aang were wrong for each other,\u201d Toph adds, but softer. \u201cYou did know, but you didn\u2019t want to hurt him, so you stuck with it until it drove you crazy.\u201d\nShe laughs a bit, hollow. \u201cI would have married him,\u201d she says honestly, eyes burning with unshed tears. \u201cIf he\u2019d proposed to me a week ago, I would have said yes.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Toph sighs. \u201cI\u2019m just glad you came to your senses before you got in so deep that there was no getting out.\u201d\n\u201cI just had this vision of myself,\u201d she goes on, as though Toph didn\u2019t speak, \u201cwhere I was fifty years old and bitter and lonely and still just \u2013 sitting there, watching him do everything and just \u2013 just having his babies and sitting there being pretty and doing nothing for anyone except him. And it was awful.\u201d\nNobody says anything in response to that. Katara suspects there isn\u2019t any kind of response that would suffice.\n\u201cYou did the right thing,\u201d Toph says finally, in a low voice, and Sokka makes a noise of agreement.\n\u201cI know I did,\u201d she snaps, starting to crumble at the seams. \u201cI just wish the \"right thing\u201d didn\u2019t hurt him like that, or make me a horrible person for just dumping him out of nowhere.\u201c\n\"At some point, you\u2019ve got to be selfish, Katara,\u201d Sokka says. \u201cYou weren\u2019t happy. You didn\u2019t want to spend the rest of your life with him. That\u2019s a good enough reason to walk away.\u201d\nShe takes a deep, shaky breath, and Sokka puts an arm around her shoulders.\n\u201cIt takes a lot of strength to leave,\u201d he goes on. \u201cYou both would have been miserable, you did him a favor in the long run.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Toph starts, and Katara can feel the glare that Sokka shoots her over her shoulders, but if Toph notices, she doesn\u2019t care. \u201cHe would never have known better, to be miserable with you. He would have thought that it was just how love is, you go home to your doormat wife and you never wonder if maybe you might have been happier with someone who actually challenged you. He would have thought he was perfectly happy, and he would have been living an empty life.\u201d\nSomehow, this does make her feel better \u2013 she actually did do him a favor, really, by leaving. She helped him to grow as a person, which, as Toph said (and was painfully right about), he wasn\u2019t doing a whole lot of while she was there to shield him from anything that might hurt.\nIt doesn\u2019t feel like much of a favor, though.\n\u201cI mean, don\u2019t get me wrong,\u201d Toph goes on, with some trepidation, like she\u2019s been itching to say this for a long time but doesn\u2019t know how Katara will react, \u201cyou definitely deserve better than to be his accessory wife, but he deserves better, too. Aang can be better than he is right now, but not while you\u2019re there to coddle him. Aang deserves to be happy, really happy, not just going through the motions and thinking that\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to be.\u201d\nShe mulls over that for a moment.\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she says finally. \u201cWhen did you get to be so wise?\u201d\n\u201cI pay attention to people,\u201d Toph replies seriously, as though the question was not intended as a joke to lighten the mood. \u201cAnd I know a lot about being miserable in something that\u2019s supposed to be perfect.\u201d\nKatara identifies with that on a deep and fundamental level, but it also breaks a dam within her and the tears she\u2019s been fighting back come out with violent force. Sokka pulls her into a hug, and then, after a moment, Toph joins in and wraps her arms around her, too.\n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna be okay,\u201d Sokka murmurs. \u201cYou\u2019re both gonna be okay.\u201d\n.\nLittle by little, she moves on. At first she\u2019s consumed by guilt, and starts several letters to Aang, explaining herself, but she always gets frustrated with them and tears them up or throws them away. A small part of her thinks that it\u2019s probably not the kind of thing you explain in a letter, anyway.\nShe just has no idea when she will see him again, or how to be ready if she ever does.\nTo fill up the time, she sets her mind to do all the kinds of things she never would done with Aang, starting with regular trips to Kyoshi to visit Ty Lee and, when she\u2019s there and not guarding Zuko, Suki. On those trips, Sokka comes along and they inevitably reconnect before having to separate again; no one, least of all them, really know where they stand \u2013 officially not together, because Suki\u2019s work takes her so far away for such long stretches, but even when they\u2019re separated it seems like they never take an interest in anyone else.\nSuki never asks why she broke up with Aang. If that\u2019s because Sokka told her, or because she somehow just knows without having to ask, Katara isn\u2019t sure.\nSomehow, Ty Lee becomes a real friend, by sheer force of personality and by simply being there for her when she\u2019s overwhelmed. They sit in her little house and drink wine sometimes and make ice cream (some delightful batches, some less-than) and talk about a lot of things and a lot of nothing; she starts to view it as a safe haven, a place to go when the stress and the guilt get to her.\nAnd there is stress \u2013 she throws herself into the Tribal council and sets herself to bettering the place, starting in little ways. Her first suggestion is the mural, which receives unanimous support, and her second is the establishment of a bending school.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have both healing and fighting techniques,\u201d she says, and gestures to Grand-Pakku, sitting across from her at the table in the still-drafty, unfinished pavilion. \u201cMaster Pakku has already agreed to work with me on blending Southern and Northern fighting styles, and he knows of a healer in the North who has expressed interest in coming here.\u201d\n\u201cHow many amateur waterbenders are there in the tribe?\u201d her father, of all people, asks, but he sounds more curious than accusing. It\u2019s Grand-Pakku who answers.\n\u201cOnly a handful as of yet, but the number will only increase as time passes. And it\u2019s better to start a school when you only have a handful of students you need to accommodate.\u201d\n\u201cAnd we\u2019ll be able to grow the school with the students,\u201d Katara offers, and Hakoda shrugs.\n\u201cI\u2019m all for it.\u201d\n\u201cQuestion!\u201d Sokka chimes in, holding a pencil and looking over a map of the city. \u201cWhere are we going to put it?\u201d\n\u201cIt needs to be somewhere pretty central,\u201d she muses, walking over to look at it with him. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t have to be smack in the middle. Just easy for everyone to get to.\u201d\n\u201cHow about here?\u201d Sokka offers, pointing a spot nearer the coast. \u201cIt\u2019s not quite within the city limits, but it\u2019s not like we\u2019ve built walls yet, and it\u2019s pretty much surrounded by water.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019ll melt in summer,\u201d Katara counters, and Sokka blinks, looking back at the map and making a face.\n\u201cRight, it\u2019s on the ice shelf, dang.\u201d\n\u201cI suggest the top of the glacier,\u201d Grand-Pakku says, raising an eyebrow. \u201cThe entry requirement is being able to reach it.\u201d\nKatara furrows her brow. \u201cNo\u2026\u201d she starts, and looks up. \u201cBecause these are going to be little kids when they start. Two, three years old. We can\u2019t make them hike up a glacier just to learn.\u201d\n\u201cSurviving on the ice would be a great final test, though,\u201d Sokka says thoughtfully. \u201cFor both being a waterbender and just being a tribesman or -woman.\u201d\n\u201cBesides, glaciers move,\u201d she goes on, ignoring Sokka entirely. \u201cWe can\u2019t build a foundation on a moving target.\u201d\nSokka looks at her oddly when she says that, and it will be much later before she realizes how that sentence applies to her in more ways than where she wants to build a school.\n\u201cWhy not attached to the pavilion?\u201d Hokada suggests, and they both look up at him. \u201cWe designed this place to be for everyone, so it\u2019s easy to get to. Everyone already knows where it is, so they won\u2019t get lost trying to get to school. And adding an east wing will be easy since we don\u2019t have the walls for that side yet.\u201d\nKatara mulls it over, before, \u201cOkay. But we have to cut canals into the ice around it.\u201d\n\u201cWon\u2019t that be difficult,\u201d Grand-Pakku says blandly, and she gives him a look.\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s settled,\u201d she says, clapping her hands. \u201cWe\u2019ll add the school on as a new Eastern Wing to the pavilion.\u201d\nAnd the Western Wing, she thinks but doesn\u2019t say because she\u2019s already winning and she knows to quit while she\u2019s ahead (at least for now), we can turn into a healing hut.\n.\nThe day of the painting, nearly six months since she left Aang, she\u2019s unreasonably nervous \u2013 what if it doesn\u2019t look right? what if the kids just sling paint all over each other until their parents take them back home? what if nobody knows where to start? \u2013 but it turns out to be unwarranted. Her father gives the kids a few ideas of things to paint, such as otter-penguins and their houses, but one particularly-artistic child takes it upon herself to paint the aurora.\nKatara helps the little girl, first by holding onto the ladder so she doesn\u2019t fall and then by holding her paints and suggesting little ways to make the colors blend better. It\u2019s definitely the best part, although some of the otter-penguins look pretty realistic and the one little boy who drew Sokka managed to somehow capture her brother\u2019s essence while absolutely failing to paint a recognizable portrait.\nSome of the kids, less-confident in their art or just unsure what to paint, leave their handprints, which gives Katara the idea for everyone who\u2019s there to do the same, and sign them \u2013 we were here.\nIn the end, when they\u2019re all covered in paint and Gran-Gran and Grand-Pakku are bringing out food for everyone, it looks a little haphazard and amateurish, but it\u2019s beautiful, maybe because of that.\nSokka claps her on the shoulder and grins.\n\u201cThis was a really great idea,\u201d he tells her seriously. \u201cI\u2019m glad you came home.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, me too,\u201d she replies, and for the first time she thinks it\u2019s unambiguously true; at this time, in this place, she has no regrets about leaving Aang and coming back here. She\u2019s known it was the right choice for herself, but it wasn\u2019t until right now that she genuinely believed that it was the right choice for other people, too.\nShe is going to be okay. It\u2019s the first time that she really, honestly knows this to be true.\n.\n\u201cSo now you want to build a hospital onto the west wing of the pavilion?\u201d Sokka asks incredulously, and she nods like it\u2019s obvious.\n\u201cFor all the same reasons that it was a good idea to build the school here,\u201d she explains, as she and a Northern waterbender work on cutting the canals into the ground. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to get to, everyone knows where it is, and it\u2019s still not complete.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d Sokka says airly. \u201cA marketplace?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t give me ideas.\u201d\n.\n\u201cSo about that marketplace,\u201d she starts a few weeks later, and Sokka waves a rolled-up blueprint at her.\n\u201cWay ahead of you, sis.\u201d\n.\nSoon, the Water Tribe isn\u2019t big enough to contain her.\nIt starts, then, if there can be a definite place where it starts, at a Council of Four, based in the Fire Nation, marking three years of peace.\nIt\u2019s the first one that she\u2019ll be going to as an ambassador and politician, representing her people alongside Sokka \u2013 they\u2019ve become something of a dream team, he argues from the practical perspective and she argues from the compassionate one, and where they meet, great things happen, and the Southern Water Tribe is (albeit slowly) gaining a reputation as an excellent place to live, if you can handle the cold \u2013 and she\u2019s nervous, but not because of the meeting.\nShe\u2019s nervous because this will be the first time she\u2019s seen or spoken to Aang since she left him at the Air Temple that day \u2013 only a little more than a year, but what feels like a lifetime ago.\nThe one who surprises her when she arrives, though, is Zuko; he surprises her both with his presence and with his closed-off expression.\n\u201cZuko!\u201d she says, stepping off the boat and opening her arms for a hug. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see you.\u201d\n\u201cGood to see you, too, Katara,\u201d he replies tightly, giving her a perfunctory, quick hug, and something is definitely off, but she can\u2019t put her finger on what, and he doesn\u2019t give her the time to. Before she can ask him anything, he\u2019s moved on to greet Sokka with significantly more cheer than he greeted her with.\nShe feels betrayed for a moment, but then she thinks about it, about how badly she treated him while she was with Aang, how dismissive, how she didn\u2019t even respond when he wanted to go find his mother, and she thinks that maybe she deserves his coldness.\nBut before she can come up with a way to apologize, or at least broach the topic of her needing to apologize, Aang is walking up and her breath catches in her throat.\nShe\u2019s spent the whole journey trying to think up how to talk to him again, but nothing ever seemed adequate. There just isn\u2019t anything to say, at the same time that there\u2019s too much to say.\n\u201cKatara,\u201d he says, with a smile that looks forced. \u201cI hear you\u2019ve been doing a lot in the Southern Water Tribe.\u201d\n\u201cI have,\u201d she replies, and the silence is so awkward she wants to sink through the docks and down into the swirling ocean, but before Aang can make things worse, Zuko either takes pity on her or decides that they have more important matters to discuss.\n\u201cWe need to get to the meeting room, Toph and Suki are already there, along with the ambassadors from the Earth Kingdom. You were the last ones we were waiting on.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, sorry,\u201d Sokka says, glancing openly between her and Aang like he\u2019d rather be anywhere else. \u201cWe got delayed, Yakone kept fighting us about the Equal Opportunities Act Katara introduced, he kept saying it wasn\u2019t necessary. You shoulda seen Katara go to town on him, though,\u201d he adds, grinning. \u201cAll about how the Northern Tribe is still so sexist that a bunch of women have already moved to the Southern Tribe, and how women get pigeonholed into these roles and it\u2019s ultimately a detriment to society because you\u2019re blocking half the population from contributing. It was pretty great.\u201d\n\u201cI had notes,\u201d she chimes in, because, honestly, if she says so herself, it was pretty great. \u201cI did a ton of research, the exact number of women immigrating to the Southern Tribe per year, testimonials from those women about why, and a great line about how \"if a woman is good enough to be an Avatar, like Kyoshi, a woman is good enough to be a hunter.\u201d I got applause.\u201c\nIt\u2019s Zuko who looks most interested in the conversation, actually laughing at her airy confidence and appearing appreciative. Aang has a strange look on his face, and she thinks maybe he\u2019s realizing that she really has been better off without him.\nIf that is what he\u2019s thinking, though, he doesn\u2019t say anything about it, and they go into the meeting room to discuss the fate of the world.\n.\nAfter the first day of the Council is adjourned, Aang seeks her out where she\u2019s standing on a balcony looking out over the docks. She cringes to herself when she hears the door open.\n\"Are you planning to ignore me this whole time?\u201d he asks, sounding hurt.\n\u201cAang\u2026\u201d she sighs, running a hand over her face. \u201cI just don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know what happened,\u201d he says in a small voice, and she turns away from him, to look at the railing. \u201cEverything was going fine, we were happy. And then you just\u2026 left.\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t fine, Aang,\u201d she says quietly. \u201cI wasn\u2019t happy. I was trying so hard to be, but I wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cBut why?\u201d he asks, coming around to stand beside her and trying to make her look at him, but she can\u2019t.\n\u201cI told you, Aang,\u201d she replies. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to spend the rest of my life watching you do everything.\u201d\n\u201cBut why didn\u2019t you say anything?!\u201d he cries, and she flinches. \u201cWe could have fixed it, you didn\u2019t have to leave!\u201d\nShe takes a deep breath.\n\u201cWe might have been able to fix it,\u201d she starts in a measured voice, stepping out onto thin ice even within herself, \u201cif I had been able to bring it up when it first became a problem. But I didn\u2019t want to hurt you, so I kept just bottling it up, and by the time it all came out I was so angry that I couldn\u2019t stand to be around you anymore.\u201d\n\u201cWhen did it first become a problem?\u201d\nShe winces, and admits miserably, \u201cBefore we started dating.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d he says, and tries to reach out to her, but she turns away.\n\u201cI could never be honest with you, Aang,\u201d she sighs. \u201cI always felt like I had to be someone I wasn\u2019t, I had to be your perfect angel and protect you all the time. I wasn\u2019t myself, everyone else could see it, but I was so determined to make myself be happy that I didn\u2019t notice how badly I was treating all my friends. It wasn\u2019t fair, to either of us.\u201d\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you think you could be honest with me?\u201d\n\u201cBecause you thought I was perfect!\u201d she cries, finally turning to look at him. \u201cYou had it all planned out and I thought it was my destiny. But I didn\u2019t have any room to breathe when I was with you. I couldn\u2019t be myself, because I always had to make sure I was doing what you wanted, being who you wanted me to be.\u201d\n\u201cI wanted you to be yourself!\u201d he counters, taking a step toward her. \u201cI love you, Katara. You, the good and the bad!\u201d\nThe tears well up in her eyes and she shakes her head, stepping away from him and toward the door. \u201cNo, Aang,\u201d she chokes. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know how bad I could be. You didn\u2019t see it. You didn\u2019t understand. You never could.\u201d\n\u201cSo, you left me because you \u2013 you think you\u2019re not good enough for me? Is that it?\u201d\n\u201cI left you,\u201d she starts thickly, voice rough with both tears and anger, \u201cbecause you didn\u2019t see me when you looked at me. Part of that\u2019s my fault,\u201d she adds, choking back a sob, \u201cbecause I didn\u2019t want you to. I didn\u2019t want you to be disappointed. So I pretended to be someone I wasn\u2019t, I pretended to be happy just sitting there watching you do everything. I should have been honest with you from the start, but I never could. I was selfish.\u201d\nShe thinks of Toph telling her that this is part of her problem, that she\u2019s always trying to make him think that it\u2019s never his fault, that she\u2019s preventing him from growing as a person.\nBut even here, even now, she doesn\u2019t think she has it in her to be completely honest with him. He just looks so hurt and lost, she wants to bundle him up in her arms and tell him that everything is going to be all right.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Aang, I can\u2019t do this,\u201d she chokes, and leaves him, again, calling after her to explain herself.\n.\nShe feels better the farther she is from him; it\u2019s like he projects some sort of unconscious aura that makes her weak.\nInstead of thinking about it, she throws herself into working out the details of the Water Tribe\u2019s new trade proposals with Sokka, who either heard about it from someone else or knows her well enough to guess, and so doesn\u2019t ask why it looks like she\u2019s been crying.\n\u201cYou think Zuko\u2019s ministers will go along with it?\u201d she asks, still breathing heavily as though she\u2019s been running, and in some ways maybe she has.\n\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d Sokka replies. \u201cIt benefits all of us. They\u2019ll get preferential deals from the South on our fishing and hunting goods, and we\u2019ll get them on their technology. The Fire Nation gets new food imports, which they need since the Earth Kingdom wants to retake all the Fire Nation colonies and stop them from sending any food back here, and we finally get to enter this century. Win-win.\u201d\nKatara makes a face. \u201cI\u2019m just not sure how I feel about us selling meat to other nations. Hunts are sacred.\u201d\n\u201cPeople are starving,\u201d he says seriously. \u201cWhen the Fire Nation\u2019s farms get back in condition and their ships finish getting re-converted for fishing instead of killing people, we\u2019ll be able to trade back and forth, and work together. But I put in a bit here about protected waters, so Fire Nation ships have to get permission to fish in Water Tribe territory. I mean, nobody\u2019s gonna get, like, arrested, but we reserve the right to escort any trespassers out of our waters.\u201d\n\u201cIt just leaves a lot open to abuse,\u201d she muses. \u201cOverfishing, I mean.\u201d\n\u201cBut look at what we could get in return,\u201d Sokka counters. \u201cBy opening our arms to them, to help them get back up on their feet, when it gets to be winter and we\u2019re all on the verge of starving, they\u2019ll have incentive to help us.\u201d\nIt\u2019s true that the Fire Nation has been in something of a food crisis, as the shift from a military industry to a production industry lags in the wake of civil wars and rebel factions trying to take down Zuko. Katara wishes she could collectively shake the entire country by the shoulders, and yell at them that it would be better for everyone if they would just work together \u2013 if you\u2019d just stop fighting and plant a damn crop, you wouldn\u2019t have to fight over food!\nBy opening up \u2013 conditionally \u2013 Water Tribe territory to peaceful Fire Nation fishers, and by selling their own surplus catches at a discounted rate to Fire Nation citizens, they can make a lot of headway into helping Zuko feed his volatile nation. She knows Zuko will be all over it, but his ministers are small-minded and conservative and she suspects that half of them have supported at least one or more attempts on his life; they may oppose it just to be obstinate, and claim the whole way that it\u2019s about Fire Nation pride.\nNational pride be damned, she thinks bitterly, your people are starving.\n\u201cIt is a good deal,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I\u2019m not sure all of those stuffy politicians will go for it.\u201d\n\u201cThey will,\u201d Sokka says firmly. \u201cIf they care at all about their people, they will.\u201d\n.\nThe next day of the Council threatens to rekindle the war.\nThe Earth Kingdom dignitaries and the Fire Nation ministers argue over colonies until Katara is genuinely afraid that it\u2019ll come to blows, and Aang \u2013 clearly still stinging over their conversation \u2013 isn\u2019t exactly doing a great job of being the objective arbiter of peace that he\u2019s supposed to be.\n\u201cGentlemen, Ladies, please!\u201d Zuko yells, composure slipping as he tries to be heard over the arguments. \u201cEnough!\u201d\nNobody except Katara, Sokka, and Suki seem to hear him; Toph is getting particularly heated with Aang, about how he\u2019s not doing his job, and Aang is yelling back at her about how there\u2019s not an easy solution here. They all look from Zuko to each other and then back, and something within Katara snaps.\nWithout stopping to think about it, she stands up and tries to call for order and then, when no one pays attention to her, she growls and brings all the water out of the humid tropical air and straight onto everyone\u2019s heads. \u201cWe are not accomplishing anything like this!\u201d she shouts, over the chorus of startled yells, and silence descends. \u201cClearly, we are at an impasse,\u201d she articulates, and then gestures to Sokka. \u201cHow about a change of subject? The Water Tribe would like to propose a series of trade deals with both the Fire Nation and the Earth Kingdom.\u201d\nSokka looks alarmed; there\u2019s nothing in there about the Earth Kingdom, but if Katara proposes anything that even smells like preferential treatment to one of the nations right now, the Earth Kingdom dignitaries will eat her alive.\n\u201cSokka will explain the aspects of the deal with the Fire Nation,\u201d she says pointedly, and adds to herself and I will come up with something for the Earth Kingdom while he talks. Sokka nods, covers up his anxiety, and begins to talk to the seething, steaming silence about their idea for opening their waters to fishers \u2013 he adds in that Earth Kingdom fishers will, of course, be allowed as well, because he\u2019s no fool \u2013 and about working out discounted rates in exchange for technology.\nZuko looks so relieved it almost makes her laugh.\n(And also wet. Her dumping-water-over-everyone trick hadn\u2019t spared him.)\nBy the time the Fire Nation ministers are finished hashing out their deals with Sokka, she\u2019s come up with the sketches of a plan for the Earth Kingdom.\nThe thing is, the Earth Kingdom doesn\u2019t need anything the Water Tribe can offer \u2013 they have plenty of farmland, plenty of waters with fish and ships to catch them. But there is one thing.\n\u201cHospitals,\u201d she offers. \u201cThere are no better healers in the world than waterbenders. I have a school for benders in the South, and Yugoda in the North has spent decades training healers. We agree to send some of our healers into the Earth Kingdom to build hospitals and help the places hardest-hit by famine and war. Plus, we can help with irrigation and rebuilding the farms that have been damaged by the skirmishes that are still breaking out.\u201d\nShe bites her tongue and hopes they accept it. They seem uncertain, so she plows on.\n\u201cLike Sokka said, we will open our waters to Earth Kingdom ships as well, and we can build some hospitals in the Fire Nation \u2013 we don\u2019t want to leave anyone out.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what do you get in exchange?\u201d a sharp-looking woman, representing Ba Sing Se, asks.\n\u201cFood,\u201d she replies simply. \u201cThe summers at the poles are too short for farming, and if we\u2019re opening our waters, we\u2019re reducing our own supplies of food. We allow you to fish in our waters, and in exchange, you sell us food so we can make it through our winters. We can also trade in goods \u2013 whalebone weaponry, whale oil for lamps, furs and artifacts.\u201d\n\u201cHmm,\u201d the Ba Sing Se lady says, watching her calculatingly, as though she can tell that Katara made this up on the fly. But it\u2019s a solid offer.\n\u201cWater Tribe textiles are some of the best in the world,\u201d Sokka chimes in. \u201cWhen poorly-made clothing means you die of frostbite, you have to be really, really good at sewing. And summer berries make unique dyes, you can\u2019t get anywhere else.\u201d\nShe can see the cogs turning in the lady\u2019s head, as she\u2019s imagining how new clothing styles and rare dyes could make her a lot of money in the Upper Tier of the city, and Katara knows they\u2019ve won.\n\u201cAll right,\u201d the lady says finally. \u201cI, for one, can agree to those terms. We all benefit from a more cosmopolitan world, after all.\u201d\n\u201cSounds good to me,\u201d Toph says, and then tacks on, \u201cand, you know, Gaoling.\u201d\n\u201cWorks for Omashu,\u201d another dignitary, sent by Bumi, says. \u201cWe do need a hospital, badly.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Kyoshi is always open to trade with the Tribe,\u201d Suki adds, smiling at Katara.\nZuko also smiles at her, and mouths thank you. Katara glows inside, and pretends not to feel Aang watching her.\n.\nThey hold a little party \u2013 \u201cMore of a soiree,\u201d Sokka, ever-pretending-to-be-a-cultural-authority, explains \u2013 on the last night of the Council, in spite of the fact that nothing has really been solved between the Earth Kingdom and the Fire Nation, and now would be the perfect time, she thinks, to maybe hash things out with Aang, but, dammit, she\u2019s happy.\nThe wine is good and the food is rich and seemingly endless and she\u2019s improved her country by leaps and bounds in the past year and now improved their trade relations with the other countries; she\u2019s flying high, and she doesn\u2019t want her tangled history with Aang to bring her down.\nShe\u2019s explaining the Equal Opportunities Act to an extremely-interested Suki when Zuko joins the conversation and they both stare at him. He looks a bit harassed.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he winces. \u201cMai just got here.\u201d\nSuki nods in understanding, and even though Katara doesn\u2019t know all the details, she knows enough about awkward reunions with exes to show him the same courtesy he showed her when she arrived.\n\u201cWe were just talking about the Equal Opportunities Act we just passed in the Tribe,\u201d she tells him helpfully, and he actually \u2013 again, like when she arrived \u2013 looks interested.\n\u201cWhat are the details of that, by the way?\u201d he asks, and it doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s just trying to come up with conversation to look too busy to talk to his ex.\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty nebulous, honestly,\u201d she admits, and he raises an eye at the word, but Katara refuses to notice. \u201cBut it basically states that, if you\u2019re hiring someone to do a job, you can\u2019t exclude women. The Water Tribe has a bad history of that, although the North has always been worse.\u201d\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s been a segregated society?\u201d Zuko asks, and she nods. \u201cThat seems weird to me, the Fire Nation has always been a lot more equal.\u201d\nIt\u2019s Suki who scoffs at this, and Zuko looks to her, surprised, so she explains. \u201cZuko, the Fire Nation is Equal In Name Only,\u201d she says, with pointed emphasis. \u201cWomen still have to be twice as good as men to get half the respect, sex workers are treated with total disdain \u2013 prostitution is illegal, for example \u2013 and women are still expected to be no more than wives, supporting their husband\u2019s careers.\u201d\n\u201cTo be fair,\u201d Katara interjects, because Zuko looks like Suki has just kicked his puppy, \u201cthat is still a lot more equal than the Water Tribe has been. It\u2019s not perfect, but what is?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a work in progress,\u201d Suki agrees, shrugging. \u201cDon\u2019t think it\u2019s all taken care of, is my point. There\u2019s still a long way to go before you\u2019ve got an equal society, and it\u2019s not gonna happen in our lifetimes. But,\u201d she goes on brightly, \u201cthe first step to solving a problem is acknowledging that there is one.\u201d\n\u201cI had never\u2026 actually thought about that,\u201d Zuko says hesitantly. \u201cI don\u2019t understand, why is it bad that prostitution is illegal?\u201d\nKatara \u2013 who was discussing this with Suki before they got into talking about the Act \u2013 mulls over how to explain it, helped along by the wine which loosens her tongue and makes her less concerned about how awkward the conversation would be otherwise. \u201cIt\u2019s like\u2026 you criminalize the person selling her body, but not the person buying it. So you lock up the woman who asks for money in exchange for\u2026 sex \u2013 \u201d she still says the word quieter, because she is not as open and forward as Suki \u201c \u2013 but not the man who pays.\u201d\n\u201cAnd more than that,\u201d Suki cuts in, \u201cyou can buy an hour of a person\u2019s time to do anything except have sex. You can pay them to paint your roof or build you a shed or even just sit and talk to you, but not to have sex with them. It\u2019s a double standard.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you can give it away freely,\u201d Katara adds, motioning with her glass. \u201cLegally, at least. But you can\u2019t sell it.\u201d\n\u201cAnd \u2013 \u201d Suki goes on, seemingly uncaring that they\u2019re probably totally overwhelming Zuko, \u201c \u2013 it makes it so much less safe. You can\u2019t make prostitution go away by banning it, but when you do make it illegal, they don\u2019t have anywhere to go if they get sick, or if someone hurts them, because they\u2019ll get arrested for prostitution.\u201d\n\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you ever told me this before?\u201d he asks, and Suki makes a face.\n\u201cI\u2019m your bodyguard, not your adviser,\u201d she replies, drunken interest already drifting over to Sokka. \u201cAnd you have a lot on your plate already.\u201d\n\u201cBut I care about all of my people,\u201d he insists, \u201cnot just the men or the rich ones.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but try passing the \"Make Prostitution Legal Act\u201d and see how far you get in the Council,\u201c Suki drawls, but it\u2019s Katara who takes offense at that defeatist attitude.\n\"So don\u2019t start there,\u201d she suggests. \u201cStart smaller, by decriminalization \u2013 like, it\u2019s not condoned, but you\u2019re not going to get arrested if you go to a hospital because the guy beat you up. Argue from the perspective of the woman who\u2019s lost everything and has to resort to prostitution, how awful it is for her to be abused and then, when she asks someone for help, she just gets arrested and abused even more. We could sell that to your Council.\u201d\n\u201cYou could sell that to the Council,\u201d Suki corrects her.\n\u201cYou could definitely sell that to the Council,\u201d Zuko chimes in, and it\u2019s so tempting, but her people need her.\n\u201cMaybe in a year,\u201d she laughs. \u201cWhen I\u2019m sick of the South Pole.\u201d\n.\nZuko tells her, when she leaves with Sokka to go back home, that she\u2019s welcome to return at her leisure, and to keep in touch, and she promises to take him up on the offer, sending the first hawk \u2013 \u201cJust checking to make sure it knows where to go. If you\u2019ve received this message in error, please send me a better hawk.\u201d \u2013 the hour she arrives.\nBut the seed is planted, now, and she can\u2019t stop thinking about all that she could do from the Fire Nation \u2013 not just for the isolated tribe on the end of the Earth, but for the world as a whole. Katara\u2019s ambition, so long set aside for the good of others, is breaking free and setting fire to her soul.\nSokka, of course, is the first to notice it, even before she does.\n\u201cYou\u2019re ready to move on,\u201d he tells her, one sharp spring day, in the weak sunlight of the beginning of the season.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she asks dumbly. \u201cI\u2019m already home.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but the Water Tribe has never been big enough for you,\u201d he explains. \u00a0\"You\u2019re pushing for bigger and bigger ideas, things that integrate us more into the world, but the Tribe doesn\u2019t need to be that integrated. Isolation has always been our policy, and you\u2019ve done a lot for trade, but we still don\u2019t get involved if we can help it. But you get involved. You can\u2019t not.\u201c\nShe doesn\u2019t know what to say, and after a moment, he continues.\n\"How much do you write to Zuko?\u201d he asks, and she blinks.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, whenever I receive a letter, I write back.\u201d\n\u201cAnd he asks you for advice?\u201d\n\u201cSometimes, yeah\u2026\u201d she starts, unsure where this conversation is going.\n\u201cYou drop almost everything to answer those letters,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, you don\u2019t leave Council meetings or family dinner, but just about anything else, you drop and you reply to him. And you spend a long time replying.\u201d\n\u201cAre you suggesting I go to the Fire Nation and offer myself as adviser to Zuko?\u201d\nSokka looks at her in a weird way, but whatever he\u2019s thinking, he doesn\u2019t let on. \u201cI\u2019m just saying, I bet he\u2019d like to see you in person. He could use the help, now that Suki\u2019s back at Kyoshi. He\u2019s all alone there.\u201d\nShe thinks about it for a moment. \u201cI can\u2019t just leave the Water Tribe,\u201d she starts in a small voice, and Sokka sighs.\n\u201cYes, you can,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re itching to. How many projects do you have left to finish?\u201d\n\u201cNot many,\u201d she answers slowly, and the more she thinks about it, the more she realizes that she has been unconsciously drawing things here to a close. \u201cJust this semester at the school, and finish building the ice gardens.\u201d\n\u201cIce gardens,\u201d he repeats, exasperated like he has always been every time she brings it up. \u201cYou\u2019re so desperate to get out of here you\u2019re trying to build gardens on a glacier.\u201d\n\u201cThere are plenty of \u2013 I\u2019m not having this argument again.\u201d She takes a deep breath, the cold air searing her lungs. \u201cI could stand a holiday,\u201d she finally concedes.\n\u201cRight,\u201d Sokka says, and she looks at him oddly.\n\u201cWhy are you so eager to get me out of here?\u201d she asks, a bit accusing, but he looks almost affronted, and it takes him a moment to respond.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want you out of here,\u201d he replies quietly. \u201cI want you happy, and doing what you love. And you\u2019re not happy here anymore.\u201d\nThe question \u201cWill I ever be happy anywhere?\u201d falls out of her mouth before she can stop it, her mind locked on her inability to be happy with Aang, and her brother\u2019s eyes soften.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone except you can answer that,\u201d he says. \u201cI think you just keep trying things on until you find what fits.\u201d\n\u201cYou would use a shopping metaphor,\u201d she deadpans, and he glares.\n\u201cI was trying to have a brotherly moment with my baby sister, but I guess not.\u201d\nShe laughs and punches him lightly in the arm.\n.\nBut he\u2019s right.\nOnce the school is closed for the semester, and \u2013 in spite of Sokka\u2019s protests about how useless they are \u2013 the ice gardens finished, she sends Zuko a letter asking if she can take him up on his offer of hospitality, and, when he replies that she\u2019s welcome to come right away, makes for the Fire Nation.\nIt seems like she\u2019s been coming this way for a long time.\nact two: it started from your arms (and it's a catalyst)\n.\n.\nThe first few days are a bit awkward.\nIt's just that she doesn't know how to talk to Zuko anymore, if she ever truly did \u2013 they had their moments, under Ba Sing Se and here at the palace on the day of Sozin's comet, and they used to be friends, but all that's left now is a couple of years of silence and, she's beginning to suspect, more than some bitterness.\nAfter all, they  used to be friends.\nHe introduces her to his ministers, and some of them are friendly or at least polite, but others look at her with something close to scorn. Surprisingly, it's  not the ones she doused at the last Council of Four \u2013 in fact, they're generally warmer to her, since she can take half the credit for their trade deal with the Tribe, and they know that she's not some clueless teenager.\nIn the first meeting, she keeps her mouth shut and mostly observes, more concerned with paying attention to who supports what (and what kind of) proposals, who seems to have the best interest of the Fire Nation at heart and who seems to care more about their own wealth, who oppose Zuko on principle and who oppose him because they disagree about the best way to govern and who agree with him on altogether  too many fronts to be anything but a brown-noser.\nWhat she comes away from the first meeting with is this: Zuko, more than Sokka knew, really is all alone here.\n Well, she thinks,  not anymore.\nExcept as soon as they leave the meeting, when she's trying to catch his attention to discuss a few things with him, he all-but flees from her. She's pretty sure he heard her say his name, but, she muses, maybe she didn't speak loud enough \u2013 the hall  is  pretty noisy, and she  was  one of the last to leave.\nOr maybe he really doesn't want to talk to her in private.\nA week later, in the second meeting, she tentatively offers her opinion on a few safe things \u2013 an older female minister, perhaps taking pity on her, brings up whether or not they can afford to expand their trade with the Southern Water Tribe, and she's able to work out what sorts of imports the Tribe might need, versus what sort of exports they would be able to offer during the summer months \u2013 but still feels like an outsider.\nThis time, she's certain that he hears her on the way out \u2013 he hesitates \u2013 but he doesn't turn or wait for her.\nIn the entire week, she's only seen him a few times, and he was friendly enough, but when she offered, once, to have a cup of tea with him, he declined with what looked like discomfort and promptly disappeared.\nIt's making her feel pretty unwanted and miserable, and she's laying awake in her room (probably used to belong to Azula, come to think of it) trying to figure out how to tackle this problem, when it hits her \u2013\n\n What ruined your relationship with Aang? \n\nUltimately, it was the fact that she never told him when she wasn't happy. She was never willing to have hard conversations with him, never willing to be up-front and honest. And this situation with Zuko is different, sure, but at the same time, it'll get sunk by the same problem if she doesn't nip it in the bud right here and now.\nShe has to  make him communicate with her. Even though it is definitely going to suck, she can't do anything for him if they're just tiptoeing around each other, never acknowledging the elephant in the room that is how she threw him away when she got with Aang.\nShe figures he's probably still up \u2013 she glances at the moon, the sun\u2019s only been down a couple of hours, of  course he's still up \u2013 and so she throws herself out of bed and dresses hastily, because she knows that if she waits until morning, she won't have the nerve to corner him and get him to admit that he's upset with her.\nHe's in his office, or at least there's light under the door, and so she marches up to it and knocks, hard, before going in without waiting for a response.\nZuko looks up from the desk with bleary eyes and stares at her for a moment.\n\u201cKnocking generally has a  purpose, you know,\u201d he drawls, and she shakes her head.\n\u201cWhat's going on here?\u201d she asks, sitting in the chair opposite his desk. He makes a face.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cI  mean, you sent me letters all the time that made me feel like I should be here to help you in person, but now that I am, you won't even talk to me.\u201d\nHis expression seems to freeze in place; it's the kind of dangerously neutral expression that could be hiding any kind of depths or demons. The silence stretches for a moment, and she takes a deep breath.\n\u201cIs it because of how I acted when I was with Aang?\u201d she offers quietly, cringing a little, and he glances away, so she continues. \u201cI know I wasn't myself. I already got it from Toph and Sokka. And I treated you really bad,\u201d she went on, the words pouring out of her, chased into sound by her own shame and need to fill the crushing silence. \u201cI should have come when you asked me to help you find your mother. I  really should have.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn't want to,\u201d he says, in a thinly neutral tone, and she looks down. It's true and it's not true at the same time: she didn't want to, yes, but not because she didn't want to help him.\n\u201cI had it in my mind that I had to be there for Aang all the time,\u201d she admits. \u201cThat I could never leave his side, and he had other things to do so I went along with them.\u201d\n\u201cThat just doesn't  sound like you,\u201d he bursts out suddenly, and she resists the urge to pull her knees up to her chest like a child.\n\u201cI was trying really, really hard to be someone I wasn't,\u201d she says quietly. \u201cI felt like it was my destiny to be his wife, and I had to make myself be happy with it. I just had to... get over anything else.\u201d\nHe's quiet for a long moment, and then, in a very low voice: \u201cI needed you then.\u201d\nThe memory \u2013 a memory he wasn't a part of, can't know he's dredging up \u2013 rises in her,  I will never, ever turn my back on people who need me!  Except she had. She'd turned her back on everyone else who needed her because she had herself convinced that Aang needed her more.\n\u201cThe lead's gone cold,\u201d he goes on, adding insult to injury, because he's hurting, and the only thing pain ever wants is to be shared.\n\u201cI'm sorry, Zuko,\u201d she breathes, and wishes that she had better words to say, some way to make him understand how awful she feels \u2013 how much more awful now, actually looking at him and  seeing how much she failed him, even after all he did for her \u2013 but there's nothing that will be enough. And even if she could express it, it wouldn't bring his mother back. \u201cI'm so sorry.\u201d\nToph and Sokka both told her that she wasn't herself, that she was disappearing into that relationship, that she stopped being Katara the moment she got with Aang, but they hadn't been as  directly hurt by her throwing everything else aside to be his forever girl.\n\u201cI know,\u201d he replies finally, but he's not looking at her. \u201cAnd I know what it's like to try and be someone you're not for someone you love, how\u2026 important it seems. And I know you're trying to fix things. I know.\u201d\n\u201cBut you can't forgive me.\u201d It's not a question, although she wishes it could be.\nHe still won't look at her, and she knows he's not the sort of person who will say that outright, even though it's true.\n\u201cI understand,\u201d she says, because she  does , even if she doesn't like it. And, well, last time, she was on his side of it, and she was a lot nastier about it. She starts to stand. \u201cI can... I can go back to the Tribe in the morning, I just \u2013\u201d\n\u201cYou don't have to  leave, Katara,\u201d he blurts out, looking up at her, alarmed. \u201cI meant what I said, you're welcome here and I think you can do a lot of good. You've helped me a lot in your letters. A  lot,\u201d he repeats, with emphasis, and she sits back down. He looks away again, uncomfortable. \u201cI keep thinking I'm ready to see you again,\u201d he goes on, in a low mutter, \u201cbut I'm always not.\u201d\nShe decides not to examine why that might be.\nEven though she came here to have this conversation, knowing full well how much it was going to suck, she thinks that she'd really like to turn into a bird and fly right out the window and away from this forever.\n\u201cI'll be fine,\u201d he says, as though reading her thoughts through the top of her head. \u201cI really enjoyed our conversation at the party last summer, it really made me think about a lot. I  do want you here,\u201d he adds, but it's as though it causes him physical pain.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she replies hoarsely, unsure of her ability to say anything else. She feels awful, somehow even worse than she did when she broke Aang's heart, because at least then she'd had the fact that she did the right thing to carry her through; this time, she's coming face to face with the fact that she abandoned and blew off a friend who had risked his life for her and to help her find closure, and she was absolutely, without question, wrong to have done so.\nAnd worse, she did it a long time ago, and hadn't realized how bad it was at the time.\n\u201cI really  am sorry,\u201d she settles on, and Zuko \u2013 for all his faults, Zuko with the heart too big for his own good \u2013 smiles at her, if a bit tightly.\n\u201cI know,\u201d he repeats.\n.\nThe air between them the next day is still cold, but at least it's clear.\nHe turns her down when she offers to have a cup of tea with him, but he at least gives her a legitimate-sounding excuse and a promise to actually take her up on it sometime.\nReally, he's being far kinder to her than she deserves, considering that his mother might be here to help him (them) if not for her carelessness, considering that he might have found the closure that he helped her find once, but instead here he is, alone in the Fire Nation except for Katara, the reason he\u2019s alone.\nThen she thinks that maybe she's being a little unfair to herself.\n Aang was her boyfriend at the time, not Zuko. All that Zuko did for her was given freely, without any promise or expectation of recompense, and she did not, strictly speaking, owe him her time.\nBut even so\u2026 Katara, the Katara that had fought his sister with him, the Katara that had transferred all of her hatred for her mother's murder onto him in the wake of his betrayal, the Katara that had donned the mask of a ghost to save a town, the Katara that he had known \u2013 she would never have thought twice about helping him find his mother, never would have considered not going with him.\nSo maybe the root of it is less that she had abandoned him as it is that she abandoned herself, or that she isn\u2019t who he thought she was.\nIt\u2026 stings to think of.\nSo she makes up her mind to stop dwelling on it. She thinks of Ty Lee's words to her, all the way back at Kyoshi when she was still reeling from what she had done to Aang:  Either they'll come around or they won't, but you shouldn't wait for them to get on with your life.\nEither Zuko will forgive her or he won't, but she shouldn't wait for it to get on with things here.\nShe'll just have to be here for him now, and somehow be here for him hard enough that it undoes the damage she did by not being here then.\nInstead of trying to get him to talk to her alone, she'll simply focus on the proposals brought up in their weekly meetings, and work things out from there. He'll come to her if he ever wants to. It's not like he doesn't know where to find her \u2013 either the expansive palace library or his sister's old room.\nIn fact, that might be part of her problem, come to think of it: she's cooped up in this place with Zuko's uncomfortable silence and a bunch of servants who are too terrified of her, for some reason, to stop and talk. Besides, she thinks that half the problems Zuko is having could be solved if he could just get a perspective that wasn't coming from a rich old noble with his or her own agenda.\nShe makes up her mind to start going into the city, to talk to people who aren't still pretty (justifiably) mad at her or possibly plotting her death or seventy years old and half-senile. Katara has never exactly been a loner; all this being alone with her thoughts will drive her mad before too long.\nThe first time she goes into the city she briefly thinks that it is, perhaps, a mistake.\nShe isn't sure what she expected; perhaps gossip, or glares, or even nasty mutters behind her back \u2013 but not total ignorance.\nNobody here knows who she is. Nobody, it seems, cares.\nIt's more uncomfortable than she expected; she got used to being recognized in the Southern Water Tribe, as both a war hero and a leader, and to come here and find herself anonymous is\u2026 unfamiliar. Still, she gamely decides to go have a cup of tea and some conversation with some strangers, in the hopes that maybe they'll have something interesting to say, or maybe some kind of secret wisdom to help her deal with her problems.\n\u201cHi,\u201d she says brightly, at the first respectable-looking tea shop she comes across. The server smiles at her, although it looks a bit brittle. \u201cDo I seat myself, or should I wait to be seated?\u201d\n\u201cYou can seat yourself,\u201d the woman replies. \u201cThere's a bar if you'd prefer sake, or I can bring you a selection of our finest teas.\u201d\n\u201cTea, please,\u201d she says, and takes a seat near the open window, looking out onto the street. \u201cAnd food?\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d the server answers, with a sweet smile.\nShe ends up with a pot of jasmine green tea and a plate of boarpig dumplings, both of which are delicious; the dumplings are just a bit spicy, complemented by the delicate sweetness of the tea. She makes a mental note to bring Zuko here someday, although hopefully without too much fanfare, if such a thing is possible for the Fire Lord.\nMaybe he can dress down, like they did before he was crowned.\n\u201cWould you like anything else?\u201d the server asks, and Katara glances up, making a split-second decision.\n\u201cI'd love some conversation, if you're not too busy.\u201d\nIt's not unreasonable; at this hour of the day, it's slow enough that she's alone in the teashop, and she thinks that the server is probably about to be finished with her shift anyway. The woman tilts her head, a bit confused.\n\u201cWhat did you want to talk about?\u201d she asks, but doesn't take the seat.\n\u201cWhat's your name?\u201c Katara offers, as a somewhat awkward conversation-starter.\n\u201cChunhua,\u201d the server replies amiably. \u201cIt means spring flower.\u201d\n\u201cIt's beautiful,\u201d she says. \u201cMine is Katara, but I don't know if it means anything. I think my parents just liked the sound of it.\u201d\nChunhua laughs a little, and glances behind her, to see if anyone is watching, before she takes the seat opposite her. She refuses the tea that Katara offers, although she thinks that's perhaps going a bit too far anyway.\n\u201cYou don't look like you're from around here,\u201d Chunhua says, \u201cif you'll forgive my mentioning it.\u201d\n\u201cI'm not,\u201d she replies. \u201cI'm from the Southern Water Tribe. I came here on\u2026 business.\u201d\nShe isn't sure why she feels the need to, for the moment, hide the fact that she's \u2013 at least ostensibly \u2013 a close adviser of the Fire Lord. Maybe it's because she feels like the server will run away from her if she does, or choose her words more carefully.\n\u201cI've heard great things about that place,\u201d she muses. \u201cIt's supposed to be one of the best places in the world to live, but I don't know if I could handle the cold!\u201d\nKatara laughs. \u201cIt  does get pretty ridiculously cold,\u201d she admits, and can't stop smiling at the fact that her home's reputation has filtered down this far. \u201cBut it is a wonderful place to live. And you do get used to it, although I guess I had an advantage, since I was born there.\u201d\n\u201cDoes that mean you're a waterbender?\u201d she asks eagerly, and Katara grins.\n\u201cI am. I helped Master Pakku found the waterbending school there, in fact.\u201d\n\u201cCan you show me something?\u201d Chunhua leans forward, eyes alight with wonder, and Katara draws the tea out of her cup, forming into an ice flower. Her new friend gasps in delight. \u201cThat's so cool,\u201d she gushes. \u201cI've always wished I was a bender, but I'm not.\u201d Her face falls a little at the words, and Katara feels bad for her.\n\u201cMy brother was always the same way,\u201d she says, leaning on her chin. \u201cBut if you ask me, he's smarter than I am. He never had an easy way out. I respect him a lot,\u201d she adds, and it's truer than she meant.\nShe misses Sokka. Somehow, she didn't expect to.\n\u201cBenders have it a lot easier than non-benders,\u201d Chunhua says, and Katara nods in sympathetic agreement, because she's self-aware enough to see that it's true. \u201cThe only public school around here just teaches benders, they don't take in non-benders.\u201d\n\u201cSo, if you're not a bender, you don't get any education?\u201d Katara asks, tilting her head, and Chunhua shakes her head.\n\u201cNot except what your parents can give you. The nobles have their own academy, but you have to pay a lot of money to get in, so if you don't have it\u2026\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYou're left out in the cold,\u201d she finishes, and what neither of them say: and you're left finding low-paying service jobs to make ends meet.\n\u201cIt's not bad,\u201d Chunhua says, although Katara thinks she's just trying to make her feel better. \u201cI mean, my parents taught me a lot. They own this place,\u201d she adds, indicating to the teashop, and it's probably intended to make her feel better, but it has the opposite implication to Katara:\n\n I might have been able to be something more, but I was born to the owners of a teashop, so all I could learn was how to serve tea. \n\nAnd that's fine, if what you want to do is make tea and meet people \u2013 she thinks of Iroh, how happy he is in his teashop \u2013 but what if Chunhua had dreams like Katara's, once, only she didn't have the means to make them happen? Owning a respectable teashop is hardly a shameful fate, but if it's not the one you want, then it's awful all the same. And if you never get the chance to choose, you never get to know if maybe you would have been able to do more \u2013 for others, and for yourself \u2013 if you'd chosen another path.\nKatara doesn't know how to make things better for Chunhua, but she  does know that she owes it to her and others like her to do the most that she can with the opportunities that she does have.\n\u201cMaybe we should open a school,\u201d she muses, and Chunhua smiles wanly.\n\u201cThat takes a lot of work.\u201d\n\u201cWork isn't the problem,\u201d Katara counters honestly, and Chunhua tilts her head. \u201cWe can do the work. I'll have to fight the council on funding, I'm sure,\u201c she adds, a bit darkly, thinking of how much they're gonna  love this one, \u201cbut people who aren't nobles deserve the opportunity to learn. Everyone benefits from expanding education.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Chunhua asks, with some trepidation, \u201cthat you'll have to fight the council?\u201d\nKatara blinks, and decides to dive in. \u201cZuko's \u2013 the Fire Lord's \u2013 Ministers,\u201d she clarifies, and Chunhua's eyes slowly widen. \u201cWe don't agree on much, but I think a lot of them  do want the best for the country. I just have to convince them of it. But you've given me a lot to think about.\u201d\n\u201cYou're on the Fire Lord's Council of Ministers?\u201d Chunhua breathes, backing away as though she's afraid Katara will explode, and she's suddenly missing her earlier anonymity.\n\u201cYes,\u201d she says. \u201cZuko's an old friend,\u201d she adds, although it's only half-true. \u201cI decided to come here to help him, he seemed\u2026 over-stressed.\u201d\n\u201cDoes that mean\u2026\u201d Chunhua starts, sounding a bit faint, \u201cthat you're the waterbender who fought with the Avatar to end the war?\u201d\nShe winces, in spite of herself. \u201cI am,\u201d she replies, a bit tightly, and Chunhua stands rapidly, face pale.\n\u201cI've been so rude, I didn't mean to \u2013!\u201d\nKatara starts. \u201cYou haven't been rude at all!\u201d she says, aghast. \u201cWhy do you think you've been rude?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a hero,\u201d she breathes, hands over her mouth. \u201cI had no idea you were here now!\u201d\n\u201cWell, I've only been here a couple of weeks,\u201d she mumbles, feeling a little embarrassed. \u201cPlease, don't treat me like I'm some kind of\u2026 like I'm special. I just want to know how I can help you.\u201d\nChunhua stares at her blankly, for almost too long, before asking, \u201cWhy?\u201d like it's genuinely strange.\n\u201cBecause that's why I'm here,\u201d she answers, also confused. \u201cTo help.\u201d\n\u201cBut nobody on that council cares about us,\u201d Chunhua says. \u201cIt's all big politics, like trade with the Earth Kingdom and deals with each other about who gets to rule over what. They just tell us what they're going to do.\u201d\n\u201cWell,  I  care,\u201d Katara says firmly. \u201cAnd I want to know what you need.\u201d\nThe silence that falls hard after her statement is long and tense, and after a moment, she decides that she's had enough, and stands.\n\u201cI'll come back in a few days,\u201d she says, laying a few coins on the table to pay for the meal. \u201cI promise, I'm not just saying that. I really  do care.\u201d\n\u201cThey usually say that,\u201d Chunhua replies softly, guarded. \u201cThat they care about us, and then they  don't. They get us into wars and get our  families killed \u2013\u201d this she says with such pointed, emotional emphasis that it can't be anything but personal \u201c\u2013 and they tell us it was for our own good.\u201d\n\u201cI'm not starting any wars,\u201d Katara says, matching her tone, heat and water rising behind her eyes. \u201cI lost my mother in the last one, I'm  not getting behind any more fighting. I want to make things better for people.\u201d\nChunhua tilts her head, eyes softening. \u201cI think I believe you,\u201d she says, and Katara smiles. \u201cI hope to see you again soon.\u201d\nShe nods. \u201cI'll be here. I promise.\u201d\n.\nShe returns in two days, and Chunhua smiles with a sort of uncertainty when she walks through the door, as though she's been burned so many times that she's afraid to hope.\nAnd Katara knows for certain that she has done the right thing by coming here.\n.\nShe writes to Ty Lee that second week, and gets a surprisingly helpful response.\n The ministers are mostly old nobility, Ty Lee writes,  but a few of them actually fought in the war. They\u2019ll be your biggest allies, some of them really lost a lot, they'll support anything they think might end the fighting for good. \nAnd also,  Mai thinks you\u2019re crazy, but she says good luck, but Katara doesn\u2019t know what to make of that. She knows that Mai left the Fire Nation altogether shortly after last year\u2019s Council of Four, and on somewhat-sour terms, although Zuko was never forthcoming in his letters and she didn't really know how to phrase the question; all of her asking-without-asking questions had received perfunctory answers with no details, and she couldn't press for more without coming off as nosy. Suki was a dead end, too, since while Katara  deeply suspects that she knows, she\u2019s always insisted that she has no idea what happened, that Mai just up and left one day.\nSo Mai could have any number of reasons \u2013 good or bad \u2013 to think that Katara is crazy for trying to help Zuko.\n(The \u2018good luck\u2019 was nice, though, even if it  was probably sarcastic. However, Katara has made it one of her life goals to see the best in people, so she\u2019s going to choose to believe that Mai sincerely was wishing her luck.)\nShe\u2019s not sure where to start on opening a public school; she\u2019d like to ask Zuko, but they\u2019re still not really talking, and Ty Lee, for all of her helpful insight into the council, didn\u2019t really know either, and finally, in a fit of mild homesickness, she writes to Sokka, and receives a reply only a day later \u2013 he must have gotten her letter and responded immediately, the way she did when Zuko would write her for advice.\n I wouldn\u2019t go that far this soon, he writes.  You\u2019ll need allies on the council before you can make something like that happen. I think you\u2019ve had the right idea so far, just watch and don\u2019t push. \n Not that you\u2019ve ever been great at not pushing, he adds, and she can almost hear him rolling his eyes.  But it\u2019s you and Zuko against all those ministers right now, the last thing either of you need is to make anybody mad. How is he, by the way? \nShe doesn\u2019t quite tell him the truth; she\u2019s still too ashamed to admit it. Instead, she tells him that Zuko is doing all right, but he really, really needs all the help he can get.\n Good thing he\u2019s got you, then, Sokka writes back, with a little smiley-face drawn next to it, and her heart sinks.\n Yeah, she replies, glad he can\u2019t see her face.  I\u2019m really glad I came here.\n.\nShe tries to take Sokka\u2019s advice, because it\u2019s good advice and because he\u2019s usually better at this kind of subtle pragmatism than she is, but she mentions it anyway at the next meeting, albeit off-hand, as though it\u2019s not that big a deal.\nOne of the ministers, a man about Iroh\u2019s age, scoffs.\n\u201cA  school?  \u201d he sneers. \u201cFor the  masses?  Please, my lady \u2013\u201d this with ironic emphasis that makes her blood boil \u201c\u2013 we are here to discuss serious matters, not those befalling  peasants.\u201d\n\u201cThose  peasants  are the backbone of your country,\u201d she counters, through gritted teeth. \u201cThey till the fields that feed your family, they man the ships that catch the fish on your plate, they fire the porcelain you drink your tea from, they  pick  the tea you drink! You don\u2019t have to agree with me,\u201d she continues, voice low with rage, \u201cbut I  demand that you show respect to the people you claim to speak for.\u201d\n\u201cYou demand?\u201d he snarls, eyes alight, and she\u2019s so angry she could  hit him \u2013 angry because that is what he responded to out of everything she said, angry because they\u2019re even having this argument, angry because she\u2019s alone and she made this bed for herself years ago \u2013 but Zuko steps in.\n\u201cMinister Xu,\u201d he says sharply. \u201cThe Lady Katara has a point. We can discuss whether or not a public school is a practical undertaking, but the people deserve respect, and I will stand behind her demand that you treat them with such.\u201d\nHe won\u2019t look at her, even as he speaks in her defense. It makes something inside of her cringe.\n\u201cOf course, my lord,\u201d Minister Xu says, although it sounds pained. \u201cI do not believe that a public school is a practical undertaking at this time.\u201d\n\u201cShe never suggested that it was,\u201d Zuko counters, raising an eyebrow. \u201cSimply that it was something the people may want in the future. We can revisit the topic at a later time when it may be more practical. I, for one, think it\u2019s something worthy of consideration.\u201d\nShe isn\u2019t sure if he really does think it\u2019s worthy of consideration, or if he\u2019s simply angry with Minister Xu; either way, she\u2019ll call it a win, for now.\nThe meeting ends shortly after that, with little ultimately being decided, but Katara does manage to catch Zuko afterward this time.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she says, a little ashamed at inadvertently turning the meeting into a scene.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good idea,\u201d he replies, shrugging, although he looks far more uncomfortable than his flippant tone would suggest. \u201cXu was wrong to dismiss it out-of-hand.\u201d\n\u201cStill,\u201d she sighs. \u201cI appreciate it.\u201d\nHis eyes soften, but then he looks away. \u201cKatara, I asked you to come here so you could help me make things better. Of course I\u2019m gonna have your back when you want to do that.\u201d\nShe smiles at him, a bit tentatively, and he even returns it, although there\u2019s a sort of closed-off sadness in his eyes.\nHe won\u2019t say it, but she hears it all the same:  even though you didn\u2019t have my back last time.\nBut it\u2019s sadness there on his face, not anger, and Katara isn\u2019t sure if that\u2019s better or worse.\n.\nThis time, she goes to the market; it\u2019s a sprawling, disorganized, open-air affair \u2013 clearly something that sprang up on its own, rather than a planned sort of thing like the market back home \u2013 filled up with people and things to be bought. Some of the shops are centered in buildings, and probably stay there full-time, things like butchers and candle-makers and herbalists, and some of the shops have been set up right there on the street; she sees a woman selling Genuine Southern Water Tribe Textiles in a loud voice, and has to stop herself and her homesickness from going over and buying things she doesn\u2019t need.\nThere are people selling foods she\u2019s never eaten, books she\u2019s never heard of, clothes more exquisite than anything she\u2019s ever dreamed of, silks and satins and brocade, with unfamiliar names like  tomesode  and  aodai; it\u2019s a loud and bustling place, but in between the dazzling array of goods, she sees the beggars and the prostitutes and the buskers.\nThe market attracts all sorts, after all. She gives a handful of silver coins to a woman playing a shamisen, and asks after her story.\n\u201cOh, the usual, I suppose,\u201d she replies, waving a hand airily. \u201cMy husband got sick and died, my son was killed in the war, and I couldn\u2019t run the farm all alone. I heard that there was opportunity in the city, so I sold the farm and came here.\u201d\n\u201cYou live in the area?\u201d Katara asks, and the woman laughs, a harsh sort of bark that speaks to the kind of humor you have to make for yourself sometimes, in the dark places.\n\u201cI live right here, friend. I didn\u2019t have enough to pay rent, and nobody would take me on as a maid, so I used the last of my coin to buy an instrument and now this is how I make my living.\u201d She pauses, sighs a bit, and then gives Katara a more genuine smile. \u201cIt\u2019s not all bad. I always wanted to be a musician, and I  do make enough to get by.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a sort of resigned hope in her eyes, the sort that\u2019s long-since given up on a better life, but merely hangs on to the belief that things might not get worse.\n\u201cOthers have it much worse than I do, my dear,\u201d she goes on, seeing the expression on Katara\u2019s face. \u201cAt least I had a skill I could use to make money, I never had to resort to crime.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re happy, then?\u201d she asks softly, and the woman glances away.\n\u201cAfter my son died, I gave up on happiness as a goal,\u201d she answers. \u201cI get by. That\u2019s enough.\u201d\nThe last is more than just a comment, it\u2019s a gentle admonition, telling Katara to stop pitying her and stop prying.\n\u201cThank you for speaking to me,\u201d she says, a bit lamely, because there\u2019s little she can say to help the lady, and less she can think of to do.\n\u201cThank you for asking,\u201d the woman counters, smiling. \u201cNot many care to.\u201d\n.\nShe gets into it with Minister Xu again at the next meeting, although she tries not to. But he makes a comment about needing more oversight in the marketplace and her visit there is still so fresh and so vivid in her mind \u2013 the beauty, the sprawl of it \u2013 and he backs up his claim with a mention to \u201cthe people who beg on the streets\u201d and it rubs her the wrong way.\n\u201cThe people beg on the streets because they don\u2019t have enough to pay rent or buy a house,\u201d she counters, biting back a righteous fury as she remembers all the kindness the people on the street showed her \u2013 far more, she thinks sourly, than what most of the ministers have.\n\u201cNow you speak for beggars, as well as peasants?\u201d Xu scoffs, and Katara resists the urge to ice over his mouth so he\u2019ll shut up.\n\u201cI speak for the people who have no voice,\u201d she hisses. \u201cThe ones you would never deign to ask, never lower yourself so much as to speak to.\u201d\n\u201cThat sort of bleeding-heart philosophy may work in your\u2026 tribe,\u201d he starts, and she can almost hear the word  savages in his tone, and her hands curl into fists entirely without her input, \u201cbut you are not in the Southern Water Tribe anymore, you cannot simply come into our country, wielding your culture like a cudgel, and remake it all in your image.\u201d\n\u201cSomeone has to speak for them,\u201d she snaps, rising in her seat, and maybe Zuko can see this ending badly, because he stands up fully.\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d he says sharply. \u201cThis meeting is adjourned.\u201d\nShe\u2019s still fuming when one of the other ministers \u2013 the older lady who discussed trade with her at that second meeting, a woman named Minister Lian \u2013 pulls her aside.\n\u201cMinister Xu may allow his emotions to get the best of him, my lady,\u201d she says, and the epithet honestly sounds sincere, \u201cbut he  does have a point. The Fire Nation does not work the same way that the Water Tribe does, and while your perspective as a member of a different culture is valuable, I do believe that it would be good for you to learn more about the country before you try to make sweeping changes.\u201d\nShe takes a deep breath, in a somewhat-failed attempt to calm herself. \u201cThank you,\u201d she says through gritted teeth, because the advice is meant in kindness, even though a part of Katara wonders just why this woman has decided to be on her side. \u201cI haven\u2019t explored the library nearly enough, I admit,\u201d she goes on, with a forced laugh, and Minister Lian smiles. \u201cI\u2019ll start tonight.\u201d\n\u201cI suggest starting with the history,\u201d Minister Lian says, and her kind smile becomes a bit more wry. \u201cThe scrolls of law are\u2026 no small undertaking.\u201d\n\u201cI appreciate your advice,\u201d Katara replies. \u201cBut what made you decide to speak to me?\u201d\nThere\u2019s an odd sort of knowing in the older woman\u2019s face, but Katara can\u2019t place it. \u201cYou have more power than you know, Lady Katara,\u201d she answers enigmatically, \u201cand you have a good heart. I hope to see you at these meetings for years to come, and I would aid you in being the best\u2026 you can be.\u201d\nShe wonders what Minister Lian was going to say after \u2018best\u2019, but isn\u2019t sure she really wants to know.\n\u201cMay you have a good evening,\u201d Minister Lian says, bowing slightly. \u201cI will see you here next week.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d she replies. \u201cI will be here.\u201c And then, remembering her manners: \u201cGood evening to you as well.\u201d\nMinister Lian smiles, and then walks away, leaving Katara alone in the meeting room with her thoughts.\n.\nShe goes to the library straight away, pulling out the scrolls of law even though Minister Lian warned her against them, along with scrolls and books on history, and sets herself up at a small table with a little lamp, and it\u2019s a nice, cozy nest of information, but then she actually starts to read them.\nAnd she realizes that the Fire Nation  really did not choose their historians based on their ability to write engagingly.\nShe makes it through one arduous, painfully-boring scroll before she decides that this little nest will be the scene of her death unless she makes a change, but there\u2019s no way around it \u2013 Minister Lian (and, she cringes, Minister Xu) was right, she  has to read these and understand them. But, she thinks obstinately, she doesn\u2019t have to do it here, in the dimly-lit, quiet, and very sleepy library.\nAll of which leads her to a small, private garden near the center of the palace \u2013 Zuko had breezed by it when showing her around the palace, although he had breezed through most things in that tour, but he did say that she was welcome to come here and \u201cuse the pond\u201d (he winced when he said it and then tried to clarify that he meant for waterbending practice, and he stumbled over himself to the point that he just gave up and went on to the next hall). And she really doesn\u2019t intend to do any waterbending right now, but she  does think the cool night air and the proximity to her element might help her focus.\nIt does, and almost too well; she doesn\u2019t hear the door slide open or Zuko walking through it.\n\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d he starts hesitantly, and she jumps, \u201care you doing?\u201d\nKatara looks up, blinking back to the world around her. \u201cI'm reading up on Fire Nation law,\u201d she replies, as though it's obvious, but he looks confused.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cBecause Minister Xu was right,\u201d she sighs. \u201cI started looking so I could prove him wrong, but he  wasn't. I can't just come into your country, wielding my culture like some kind of \u2013 of cudgel. If I want to help you \u2013 and I  want to help you \u2013 I need to actually understand your country.\u201d\nZuko stares at her for an uncomfortably long moment, and finally she shifts.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nHe makes a face. \u201cI don't think any of those ministers have actually read those scrolls. They teach some of it in school, but  nobody reads the scrolls themselves. They're\u2026 dry.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I didn't go to your school,\u201d she shrugs. \u201cAnd I can tell nobody\u2019s read these. There are so many laws that contradict each other, or just don't make sense. Did you know,\u201d she starts, because it's so bizarre and, in her mildly sleep-deprived state, hilarious, \u201cthat under the reign of Fire Lord Haulo the Second, it was made illegal to ride ostrich-horses on the palace roof? Why is that a law? Did he  honestly have so many people doing it that he felt the need to make a law?\u201d\n\u201cI'm more concerned with how,\u201d Zuko muses, and she glances up to see him peering at the roof, which is very high up and sharply angled. \u201cHow do you even get an ostrich-horse on the roof?\u201d\nThey look at each other, and the decision is made.\n\u201cSomewhere there has to be a roof access,\u201d she says, at the same time that he says, \u201cThere's gotta be a trapdoor or something, big enough you can get one through.\u201d\nHe helps her to her feet. \u201cNow,\u201d she starts, hands on her hips, \u201cif I was a giant trap-door to the roof, where would I hide?\u201d\n\u201cProbably the south wing,\u201d Zuko suggests. \u201cIt doesn't get used as much.\u201d\nEventually, they find it in the north wing, behind a secret passage that Katara stumbles upon entirely by accident.\nIt's very simple, just an opening in the wall that leads to a staircase up to a platform and a well-concealed door that opens up to a parapet on the roof.\n\u201cYep,\u201d she says, to a bemused-looking Zuko (who is apparently learning far more about the kind of people who built his nation than Katara is at the moment), stepping out onto the clay tiles and looking out over the sloping palace and far-below Caldera, \u201cyou could definitely ride a flock of of ostrich-horses through here.\u201d\n\u201cBut why would anyone  do that?\u201d\nShe thinks about it for a moment. \u201cMy theory is, a couple of kids figured out about this passage and decided to have fun with it.\u201d\n\u201cWhere would they get the ostrich-horse?\u201d\n\u201cAll they'd have to do is rent one for a while,\u201d she suggests, and he seems to think it over before shrugging agreeably.\n\u201cI could see that,\u201d he replies, and then hesitates for a moment, before: \u201cMy theory involved crazy assassins.\u201d\n\u201cAlso a possibility.\u201d\n\u201cDon't say that,\u201c he says, with an exaggerated shudder. \u201cI can't walk out of this place without a half-dozen daggers flying at my face, the last thing I need is for them to find a way into my palace.\u201d\nShe laughs, in spite of the dark subject matter. \u201cI take it back, then. Totally assassin-proof.\u201d\nHonestly, it probably is; the only access is from inside the building, and if you were already inside, why go all the way to the roof? Privately \u2013 although things between her and Zuko are too strained for her to dare bring it up \u2013 she thinks that it was probably built-in as a place for the Fire Lord to get away from the rest of the court, perhaps with his or her lover.\nA quiet, secluded place where they could stargaze and look out over the city. It's actually kind of sweet to think about, the Fire Lord (and if it was the one who built the palace \u2013 she cringes internally at the fact that she now knows this \u2013 it would have been Fire Lord Amaya the First) specifically building in a secret place where she and all of her descendants could go for a private, romantic moment.\nIf she was Haulo the Second, she thinks she might have been upset, too, if some snot-nosed prince used this as a way to play pranks on his dad.\nShe takes a seat near the edge, where she can look out over the city, and Zuko joins her after a moment.\nThe Caldera is beautiful from up here, spread out underneath them, a bunch of tiny lights and stars reflected off the calm ocean, and for a long time they just sit in companionable silence, until Zuko takes a deep breath.\n\u201cI appreciate that you're reading up on our laws,\u201d he says abruptly, and she glances at him, so he continues. \u201cI mean, it means a lot to me. Those scrolls are  dense.\u201d\nShe smiles. \u201cPromise me something, Zuko,\u201d she sighs, with more drama than is necessary. \u201cWhen you hire historians to write about all that happened in our lives, make sure they can write a good story. Your sages somehow made the history of  dragon-riding  boring. I wouldn't have thought that was possible.\u201d\nZuko laughs outright at this.\n\u201cBut seriously,\u201d she goes on, leaning back onto her hands. \u201cI meant it when I said I wanted to help you. You've been under  way too much stress.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cAnd\u2026\u201d he hesitates, then rubs the back of his neck. \u201cI'm sorry for being\u2026 mean to you when you first got here.\u201d\nShe looks at him. \u201cZuko, when I felt like you'd betrayed me,\u201d she begins softly, \u201cI threatened to  kill you. You weren't mean, you were just honest. I deserved it.\u201d\nHe looks like there\u2019s something more he wants to say, but whatever it is, he shakes his head and glances away. \u201cStill. I was mad at you for caring more about your boyfriend than me, and that wasn't fair.\u201d\nShe shakes her head, but doesn't press it; Zuko seems to believe that anything that goes wrong is because of his failure, never because of someone else's failings or because the world sometimes just isn't fair.\n\u201cI forgive you,\u201d he says finally, in a bit of a rush, \u201cis what I'm trying to say. Not that\u2026 I don't really think you\u2026 I mean, you said you didn't think I could ever forgive you, but it's not like\u2026 that.\u201d He winces hard and looks away, and she pokes him in the arm to bring his attention back to her, but she doesn't really know how to respond.\nSo, she takes a leaf out of Toph's Method of Dealing With Life, and makes a joke of it. \u201cAnd we didn't even have to go on a life-changing field trip this time!\u201d\nHe laughs, so she calls it a win. \u201cAre you kidding?\u201d he asks, looking at her with a smile on his face. \u201cThis  was life-changing. I know how to get an ostrich-horse on the roof now.\u201d\nKatara laughs.\n.\nHe suggests a cup of tea the next morning, and she smiles.\n.\nThings do begin to improve; the air between her and Zuko is warmer now than it was before, and she has a better grasp on the nuances of the Fire Nation, even though she's only part of the way through the scrolls she's borrowed from the library. In spite of their dryness, each one she reads makes her more determined to read the next one, to  understand, to find a way \u2013 either hidden in the old tomes or of her own making \u2013 to help Chunhua and the shamisen-player and all the others like them.\nShe surprises Minister Xu at the next meeting, when they revisit the topic of \u201ccleaning up\u201d the marketplace, and she cites a Fire Sage's writings about how fire has the power to warm those without coats and bring light to those without lamps, how it is their duty, as leaders, to be warmth and light when there is little to be found elsewhere.\n(Minister Lian seems to have trouble concealing a grin.)\n\u201cI disagree that that is our job,\u201d Minister Xu says thoughtfully, but sounds significantly more respectful than he ever has previously. \u201cPeople can find jobs, if they simply expend the effort to look. There is plenty of work to be done, after all.\u201d\n\u201cBut if you can't get on your feet in the first place, who would hire you?\u201d she counters. \u201cAnd that brings me to my next point, actually, thank you, Minister,\u201d she says, nodding at him and glancing to (an amused-looking) Zuko. \u201cYou have a point, that there  is plenty of work to be done, but there's no organization. People don't know where they can find work. They come to the city because they've heard there's opportunity here, but they don't have anywhere to start. I'd like to propose a sort of\u2026 connecting agency, that finds people who are looking for jobs, and pairs them with people who need help.\u201d\nThere's a short pause as that sinks in, and Zuko nods. \u201cI like it.\u201d\n\u201cI would like to join in this,\u201d Minister Xu says, glancing from her to Zuko, who raises an eyebrow. \u201cI know a number of people who have jobs which need doing, and if the lady can connect them to people needing work, I think we can all benefit.\u201d\n\u201cI have no objection,\u201d Zuko says, but sounds a bit hesitant, and glances at her. She has serious reservations about working with Xu, but, well, everyone  does stand to benefit from this.\n\u201cNeither do I,\u201d she replies, and forces herself to smile.\n.\nLater, she wants to discuss with Zuko how to go about making this agency happen, but he isn\u2019t his office, and the servants tell her that he hasn\u2019t yet gone to bed, and he isn\u2019t in the kitchen or the garden or the library\u2026\nIt hits her while she\u2019s standing in the empty, dark library, trying to figure out where Zuko might be.\nOf course.\nSure enough, he\u2019s on the roof, laying on his back and looking up at the stars, and he starts when she walks through the door, then relaxes.\n\u201cYou found me,\u201d he says bluntly, and she laughs a little.\n\u201cWell, you weren\u2019t anywhere else,\u201d she replies, and lays down beside him; he doesn\u2019t look at her. \u201cIf I was a really serious minister trying to talk to you about serious stuff, I would have given up.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d\nThey lay there for a long moment, and she figures that the politics can wait until tomorrow; in fact, she decides, right here and now, not to talk policy at all up here. She isn\u2019t sure what Fire Lord Amaya the First really intended when she built this place, but  Katara decides that it is going to be a safe haven from all the stresses of being in charge.\nThe night sky is brilliant, this far up above the rosy lamps and bustle of the streets, and it\u2019s a new moon, so there\u2019s nothing up there to see except the stars and the milky white splash near the eastern horizon.\nShe points at it.\n\u201cYou know what that is?\u201d she asks, and it\u2019s only half a question. Zuko glances at her.\n\u201cWhat?\u201c\n\u201cIt\u2019s Torgarsuk\u2019s paint well,\u201d she tells him, turning her head to look at him and catching his eyes for a second before looking back up. \u201cMy mother told me the story, how he painted the sky with stars to please his sister the moon, and we know this because he left his paint on the edge of the canvas of the sky. He also painted the constellations,\u201d she goes on, still feeling his eyes on her and willing herself not to blush. \u201cThe bear, the iceberg, the koi and the penguin-otter and the tiger-seal. All so she\u2019d have company up there.\u201d When Zuko doesn't respond, she prompts him: \u201cWhat stories did you hear?\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d he says, a bit uncertainly, \u201cnobody ever told me stories about\u2026 constellations. But,\u201d he adds thoughtfully, \u201cmy mother  did tell me the story of how the first dragon breathed fire into the sun.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d\nHe glances at her. \u201cThat's\u2026 that's the story,\u201d he mutters lamely, and she snickers at his tone. \u201cThe first dragon breathed fire into the sun to light up the world, it\u2026 it wasn't exactly in-depth.\u201d\n\u201cMy mother told me that the sun and the moon were twins, two sisters,\u201d she says slowly. \u201cThey got into a fight one day, and the sun, Siq, ran away from her sister, Tui, but Tui gave chase, unwilling to give up the fight, and she's so single-minded that she forgets to eat, and that's why the moon wanes. And when Tui catches up to Siq, there's a solar eclipse. That was\u2026 before I knew about the spirit oasis,\u201d she adds, wincing.\nBut Zuko is smiling. \u201cThat doesn't mean it didn't happen, once,\u201d he suggests, and she looks at him, returning his soft smile.\n\u201cSokka says it's nonsense,\u201d she says, sighing and looking back up. \u201cBut I  like  the thought. I  like living in a world where the sun and moon argue, and where a spirit painted the stars to make his sister happy. It makes me feel\u2026 I don't know, less alone.\u201d\n\u201cYou feel alone?\u201d Zuko asks, sounding genuinely concerned, and she bites her lip.\n\u201cMy mom was my best friend when I was little,\u201d she replies, without looking at him. \u201cWhen she died, I felt like\u2026 nobody would ever understand me like she did, or be there for me. I was wrong,\u201d she adds unnecessarily, glancing sideways at him. \u201cBut I guess those feelings die hard. I just like to believe that I live in the world she told me stories about, it\u2026 it sort of keeps her alive to me.\u201d\nThey fall quiet for a long time, until Zuko glances at her, biting his lip.\n\u201cDo they have different constellations down there?\u201d he asks, and she shakes her head.\n\u201cNo, it's mostly the same stars,\u201d she replies. \u201cIn the Northern Tribe, they're all different, but there's plenty of the same ones here. Why?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I'm trying to find  any of those that you mentioned, and I've got nothing.\u201d\nShe laughs. \u201cI think you have to have a  really vivid imagination,\u201d she concedes. \u201cI mean, I've never seen a bear,\u201d she says, pointing at it. \u201cI always said it was a pot.\u201d\nZuko nods slowly. \u201cI've always seen a cart,\u201d he admits, and she tilts her head.\n\u201cYeah, I can see that,\u201d she muses. \u201cYou've got the lead for the ostrich-horse, and then the cart itself. I don't really know how they got a bear.\u201d\n\u201cI did see the dragon,\u201d he says, pointing at the constellation which is, to her, the koi. If she puts herself into the shoes of a little Fire Nation kid, growing up on tales of dragons setting fire to the sun, she can see where he's coming from.\n\u201cI see the koi,\u201d she tells him, and he shrugs.\n\u201cThey do have the same kind of shape,\u201c he says, and then adds, \u201cat least when you're connecting dots. Not\u2026 in real life, they're not really the same shape.\u201d\nKatara laughs, because now she's picturing little dragon-koi in the spirit oasis, and it makes her happy.\nThe silence that settles in after that is warm and light.\n.\nShe and Zuko are both bleary-eyed and nursing large cups of strong black tea in the morning, having spent  entirely too long on the roof discussing constellations, although weirdly enough, he looks less tired than he did when she first got here.\n.\nThe agency doesn't quite go off without a hitch, but it does go a lot smoother than she would have expected, and although she  does receive a few glowers from some of the less-helpful ministers, Xu is a surprisingly enthusiastic coworker. And then, while they\u2019re going over a map to find a place to base the agency out of:\n\u201cI apologize for my rudeness,\u201d he tells her abruptly, and she looks up, startled, so he continues. \u201cYou must understand my perspective. The Fire Lord brought an old friend with very little political experience into his council of ministers and she immediately set about to telling us how we've done things wrong. I thought you naive and arrogant,\u201d he admits, without any apparent shame or compunction. \u201cBut I see now that you do have the best interests of the nation at heart, and so I apologize for being rude.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she replies slowly. \u201cAnd\u2026 I apologize, too, for not taking the time to learn about the nation's laws and history. And for losing my temper.\u201d\nHe smiles thinly. \u201cYou're a passionate young woman, Lady Katara. Perhaps Lian has a point,\u201d he adds, rubbing his beard thoughtfully, \u201cthat such passion and drive to improve the world could be a good thing.\u201d\nSo Lian and Xu have been talking about her? Interesting.\n\u201cHowever,\u201d he goes on, raising an eyebrow, \u201csimply because I respect you does not mean I agree with you in all things.\u201d\n\u201cNor do I expect you to, Minister Xu,\u201d she says, and smiles. \u201cYou're a pragmatist, I wouldn't think you'd agree with all of my ideas.\u201d\nHe sighs and glances out the window. \u201cI was once an idealist, my lady,\u201d he says, apparently out of the blue. \u201cI fought at the Siege of Ba Sing Se,\u201d he goes on, which surprises her, because she had Xu pegged as someone who never fought in the war, \u201cunder General Iroh, when he was still the crown prince. We had great dreams of bringing the light of our civilization to the backwards Earth Kingdom, making things better for everyone by bringing them all under one rule.\u201d\nShe isn't sure how to respond, but he doesn't really give her the opportunity to.\n\u201cI lost my son on that battlefield,\u201d he says softly, \u201cas did the General. I didn't see it happen, I only found his body among the dead later. All that my fighting for a better world accomplished was my son's body in a mass grave.\u201d He looks down, and then back at her. \u201cSo now I confess that I have little patience for ideals, and less for fighting unwinnable battles.\u201d\nKatara thinks over that for a moment, before biting her lip. \u201cDo you know a man named Yon Ra?\u201d she asks quietly, and he raises an eyebrow.\n\u201cI've heard of him,\u201d he replies. \u201cFormer leader of the Southern Raiders, if memory serves.\u201d\nShe nods. \u201cHe is. I tried to kill him four years ago,\u201d she says simply, and Xu actually laughs once at that, although it sounds more surprised than amused.\n\u201cHe stopped you?\u201d\n\u201cI  stopped me.\u201d She pauses for a moment, weighing how much she really needs to tell him to get her point across. \u201cThe Southern Raiders attacked my tribe many, many times,\u201d she sighs. \u201cYon Ra killed my mother. I wanted him dead, I wanted him to  suffer. But when I actually had him at my mercy, I couldn't bring myself to do it, no matter how much I hated him. My point is,\u201d she goes on, looking up, \u201cI didn't come to my idealism from a place of naivety. It's a  choice  I've made, and still make every day, to believe that the world can be  better than the one I grew up in.\u201d\nXu watches her critically for a long moment. \u201cThe Fire Nation killed your mother and destroyed your home,\u201d he murmurs, \u201cand yet you came here with ideas of helping us?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d she answers, nodding. \u201cBecause a better world starts with  me. I can't sit here and preach about peace and a better world if I'm not willing to let go of my own anger. How could I expect anyone else to, if I don't do it first?\u201d\nHe tilts his head. \u201cIf you were anyone else,\u201d he says slowly, \u201cI would expect that you were secretly trying to destroy us from within.\u201d\n\u201cBut you trust me?\u201d\n\u201cTrust is not a word I like to use in the high court,\u201d he counters, raising that eyebrow again. \u201cBut I do believe you when you say that you want peace. We have the same goals, Lady Katara, and I hope that we can work together to bring them about.\u201d\nShe smiles. \u201cI do, too, Minister Xu.\u201d\n.\nThe Fourth Annual Council of Four is coming up much quicker than she thought it would, and the plans for that soon eclipse all other discussion; it'll be in Ba Sing Se this year, and, unfortunately, they're expecting to be revising many of the things that didn't get resolved at the last one, mainly the issue of the colonies.\n\u201cI just have no idea what to  do,\u201d Zuko groans, over a pot of tea in the kitchen late one afternoon. \u201cI get where the Earth Kingdom is coming from, but some of those people have been there for a hundred years. I can't just kick them out and make them come back here.\u201d\n\u201cEspecially when there isn't much  for  them here,\u201d Katara adds, and he looks up at her with something akin to desperation in his eyes. \u201cOur job-finding agency has been pretty successful, but it's not  creating work, just connecting people to it. What we need is some kind of\u2026 I don't know, project that we can hire people to work on, and maybe entice people from the colonies to come back and work there. That way, they'd have a good reason to return, and something to come back to.\u201d\n\u201cBut  what? \u201d he asks, and she sighs.\n\u201cI don't know. I'll think about it, though,\u201d she says, and shrugs. \u201cAnd I'll bring it up in the next meeting. There are a lot of businesspeople on your council, maybe they'll have ideas.\u201d Zuko makes a face, and she leans in over the table. \u201cHey, that's what they're there for. To advise.\u201d\n\u201cThey think they're there to make themselves more money.\u201d\n\u201cNot all of them,\u201d she counters, thinking of Lian's advice and Xu's admission about his son's death. \u201cSome of them really  do want peace and prosperity for the country.\u201d\nHe runs a hand through his hair and drains his teacup, and he looks so frustrated that her heart goes out to him.\n\u201cZuko, it's gonna be okay,\u201d she says seriously, and pours them both another cup. He looks up at her. \u201cI  mean  that. It's going to work out. I'm here, and I'm on your side.  We are going to make this work.\u201d\nHe watches her for a moment with an unreadable expression, before taking a deep breath. \u201cOkay,\u201d he breathes, nodding. \u201cOkay. Just\u2026 think positive.\u201d\n\u201cDon't strain yourself,\u201d she says, smirking, and he gives her a mock-glare.\n\u201cI mean, I can be doom and gloom, if you'd prefer.\u201d\n\u201cPlease, I've seen you at your angstiest,\u201c she retorts, waving a hand. \u201cThat doesn't scare me.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d he counters, with feeling, and she laughs. \u201cNo, trust me, you have  not.\u201d\nA servant comes in with a letter in-hand, and walks up to them with what appears to be apprehension. \u201cMy Lord?\u201d he says, and Zuko looks up. \u201cIt's for you.\u201d\nZuko takes it but doesn't look at it, simply setting it down on the table and thanking the servant, who looks oddly relieved.\n\u201cYou're not going to read it?\u201d Katara asks, and Zuko shakes his head.\n\u201cIt's probably some political drama about the Council of Four,\u201d he replies. \u201cIt can wait.\u201d\nKatara smiles, and sips her tea. \u201cNo crappy politics during teatime?\u201d she suggests, and he snickers.\n\u201cI'm going to make that a new official proclamation. Whatever it is, it can wait until I've finished my damn tea.\u201d\n\u201cI'm all for it,\u201d she says, raising her cup to toast, which he returns, smiling at her. He really looks so much younger when he smiles, she thinks, younger and brighter.\n\u201cTo dealing with it later,\u201d he toasts, and she laughs.\n\u201cTo dealing with it later,\u201d she repeats, and they drink.\n.\nIt must have been something more serious, though, because Zuko doesn't come to dinner and she doesn't see him at all afterward, so she goes looking.\nShe finds him on the roof, holding the letter and looking up like the stars will answer his questions.\n\u201cYou know you have an early meeting, right?\u201d she asks, as a bit of an icebreaker as well as a reminder. Zuko glances at her.\n\u201cI couldn't sleep,\u201d he replies softly, and she sits next to him, waiting. She thinks she knows Zuko pretty well by now: if he didn't want to talk about the letter, he would have put it in his pocket when he heard the door open. But at the same time, he won't want to be asked. He's strange like that. (Or maybe not; she recalls how she spilled everything about her break-up to Ty Lee, who barely asked her anything, but clammed up when Sokka did the same. Maybe there's something in the both of them that feels more need to fill up silences than answer questions.)\n\u201cSomething on your mind?\u201d she prompts, but pointedly keeps her eyes on his face rather than calling attention to it. He sighs.\n\u201cIt's from Mai,\u201d he says, holding up the letter. She does not want to examine the emotion that rises up in her at his wistful tone. \u201cApologizing.\u201d\n\u201cFor what?\u201d she asks, with no small amount of trepidation.\nHe runs a hand through his hair.\n\u201cHer father tried to have me killed last year,\u201d he answers, in a strange sort of tone that makes her think of herself, almost two years ago, wishing that Sokka would just leave her alone, even though it was all threatening to burn her up from the inside out. \u201cShe told me about the plot, but she lied about her father's involvement. Said he was innocent.\u201d He laughs, mirthlessly. \u201cNow she's saying that she made a mistake, and asking me to understand.\u201d\nKatara lets that sink in and roll around in her head for a moment, before forming a response.\n\u201cUnderstanding isn't the hard part,\u201d she muses, and when he looks at her, eyebrow raised, she goes on. \u201cIt's  not. What she did is completely understandable, it's just wrong. I feel bad for her,\u201d she goes on, glancing away. \u201cThat's an awful place to be stuck, and a terrible choice to have to make, but she still made the wrong one.\u201d\n\u201cShe tried to be neutral,\u201d Zuko says, voice deceptively even, and she doesn't know if he's agreeing or disagreeing with her. When he doesn't go on, she feels that powerful need, again, to pour something of herself into the silence.\n\u201cBut sometimes neutrality is  wrong,\u201d she says deliberately. \u201cIf you're walking down the street and you pass someone beating another guy up, and you just say \u201cwell I'm neutral on this,\u201d you've just helped the attacker by  not helping the victim. You might have good reasons not to get involved, but you've still implicitly supported the guy doing the attacking.\u201d\n\u201cShe  did help me, though,\u201d he points out. \u201cShe warned me.\u201d\n\u201cAnd left you with a traitor among your staff, who you didn't know you couldn't trust,\u201d she counters, with feeling. \u201cWhat happens next time, when he keeps her in the dark about it because he figured out that she warned you? Then what?\u201d\nZuko looks away. \u201cThen what, indeed,\u201d he murmurs, almost too quiet to hear, and shakes his head. \u201cYou don't really understand Mai,\u201d he says, louder, and she looks at him, a bit affronted. \u201cShe tried to be neutral because that's what she  does, it's what she was taught to do. Be a mediator, keep things running smoothly. She tries to be neutral on everything.\u201d\n\u201cBut you  can't  always be neutral. Sometimes you  have to pick a side.\u201d\n\u201cForgive me,\u201d he says, with a wry, tired-looking smile, \u201cbut I don't think you've ever been neutral on anything in your entire life.\u201d\nShe laughs a bit at that. \u201cI can't think of much I don\u2019t have an opinion on, that's true.\u201d\n\u201cIt's easy for you, is what I mean,\u201d he adds, more serious. \u201cIt's not easy for Mai. She was brought up to never rock the boat.\u201d\nKatara thinks about it for a moment before replying, in a measured voice, \u201cThen she wasn't right for you.\u201d\nZuko tilts his head. \u201cYou think I don't need someone who's been trained to make things stable?\u201d he asks, and his tone is almost rhetorical; she wonders who he intends to convince.\n\u201cI think you don't need someone who's been trained to maintain the  status quo,\u201d she clarifies. \u201cMaybe if you were crowned in peacetime, when things were already going pretty good for most people, then you'd want someone who keeps things running smoothly. But, Zuko,\u201d she sighs, runs a hand through her hair, and winces at him, \u201cthings kinda  suck  for a lot of your people right now. I mean, people are starving, watching their  children starve, because a lot of the men and women in power aren't willing to let go of the war. You don't need to be compromising with people who would let your citizens starve to death in the cradle.\u201d\nThere's something written in his expression, something she doesn't want to read just yet, something about longing.\n\u201cYou really care about them,\u201d is all he says, though, in a strange voice.\n\u201cI do,\u201d she replies simply. \u201cI care a  lot about them. I've spent a lot of time in the city and the markets, talking to people about what's wrong, and they're good people, Zuko.\u201d She looks at him fervently. \u201cThey deserve better, and if I can help give it to them, I'll do whatever it takes.\u201d\nHe's still looking at her with that odd expression, and she turns away, feeling a bit awkward and unsure of her footing.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nShe looks up at the question. \u201cWhy?\u201d she repeats, a bit dumbly, and he shrugs.\n\u201cWhy do so much for us? For  me?  You could have had the easiest life,\u201d he goes on, sounding a bit agitated. \u201cYou could have married Aang and never had to get involved in any of this. Why did you  choose all this stress and drama?\u201d\nShe turns away from him again, but this time to the sky, the stars, her mother\u2019s story of the paint echoing her in her mind, but it's less the tale that she's listening to, than it is her mother\u2019s voice. It's so far gone to time that it sounds like her own, but she can still close her eyes and  be there  all over again, in the hut during the long, dark winter, listening with her head in her mother\u2019s lap, to the story of how the stars came to be.\n\u201cI have the means,\u201d she answers slowly, after a while. \u201cI can  help them. And if I don't, who will?\u201d\n\u201cThe rest of us,\u201d he replies, but it sounds almost teasing. \u201cYou know things would probably have been just fine, eventually,\u201d he goes on, and she refuses to look at him.\n\u201cJust fine  isn't good enough,\u201d she replies, with force that seems to startle him. \u201cJust fine  would have been my life with Aang, your life with Mai. We would have been  just fine  every day,  just fine  going about our business, going to sleep every night,  just fine. All four nations,  just fine. But not  great,\u201d she continues, hugging herself around the middle. \u201cNot even  good. Not fulfilling, not with the most opportunities, not with real peace and safety.\u201d She pauses for a moment, biting back a hard knot of emotion low in her throat. \u201cMy mother didn't die for me so I could have a  just fine  life.\u201d\nThey're both quiet for a long time, and then he says, in a low voice, \u201cYou know a lot of those ministers don't agree with you.\u201d\n\u201cI'm not going to apologize for doing what I believe to be right,\u201d she replies simply. \u201cIf something happens to prove me wrong,  then  I'll apologize and change what I'm doing, but  only  then. People deserve a better world. I don't care if they worship me or execute me for it, I'm going to  fight for that.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d he says after a moment, looking down toward the city, \u201cif they wanna execute you for it, they'll have to get me first.\u201d\nShe smiles at him and he returns the smile, albeit a bit uncertainly, like he's not sure he's supposed to.\n\u201cWhat are you going to tell Mai?\u201d she asks quietly, and he takes a deep breath as the moment dissolves between them. She isn\u2019t sure she wanted it to.\n\u201cI don't know,\u201d he answers. \u201cShe's at Kyoshi with Ty Lee, but I don't think she's training to be a warrior, I think she's just\u2026 waiting for me to tell her she can come home.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Katara asks, and when he gives her a  really?  look, she goes on. \u201cI thought she hated it here.\u201d\n\u201cShe didn't hate me.\u201d\n\u201cSo?\u201d she counters, and she knows she sounds a bit callous, but that's sort of the point. \u201cTrust me, Zuko, she  will. If you're the reason she has to spend her life trapped in a place she hates, it doesn't matter how much she loves you at the start, she'll hate you eventually. She may never tell you,\u201d she adds, glancing from him to the letter and then away, \u201cjust like I never told Aang. But if I had stayed with him, I would have grown to hate him.\u201d\nIt's the first time she's ever said it out loud, even really formed the thought in so many words, but it's so blindingly true that she can't imagine why she never saw it before. She would have hated him in the end \u2013 she would have been fifty, sixty, seventy years old and bitter and feeling like she'd wasted her life, and she would have hated him for being the reason for all of it.\nEven the sweetest fruit turns sour if it's planted in poisoned ground.\nHe doesn't answer for a long time, and so she takes a deep breath, steeling herself for something she won't even think of too clearly, before asking, \u201cDo you miss her?\u201d\nHe seems to hesitate, still watching her even though she won't look directly at him.\n\u201cNot really,\u201d he admits finally.\n\u201cSo be honest,\u201d she says, and won\u2019t acknowledge the relief she feels when he says that. \u201cTell her the truth.\u201d\nHe laughs, a bit bitterly. \u201cAnd what is that? That I don't hold it against her, but I don't really care if she comes back here or not? I don't think that'll make her feel better.\u201d\n\u201cBetter an unpleasant truth than a sweet lie,\u201d she counters, but still, she sees his point. \u201cYou don't have to be  mean about it. Just say that you don't hold it against her, but you think it's best if the two of you stay apart for a while.\u201d\nHe seems to be undecided, so she stands up.\n\u201cWorry about it in the morning, okay, Zuko?\u201d she suggests softly, reaching out a hand to help him to his feet. He looks at it for a long,  long moment, long enough that she starts to feel uncomfortable, before he smiles like some kind of weight has lifted, and takes it, standing up beside her. He seems reluctant to let go of her hand, or maybe she's just projecting.\n\u201cRight, early meeting,\u201d he says, nodding and running a hand through his hair, before making for the door. \u201cWe should both get some sleep.\u201d\n\u201cWait,\u201d she starts, a bit alarmed. \u201cYou say that like I'm supposed to be there with you. I didn't think I was supposed to be there.\u201d\nHe glances back at her, a genuine, if tired, smile on his face. \u201cI thought you wanted to help me improve the country,\u201d he teases. \u201cWe've gotta get an early start on that.\u201d\n\u201cI'm not a firebender,\u201d she counters, hands on her hips, \u201cI do  not  rise with the sun.\u201d\n\u201cYou're in the Fire Nation, though,\u201d he says, and he looks entirely too amused for her tastes. \u201cIt's a meeting with an ambassador from Ba Sing Se, I think you met her at the last Council. It\u2019s just about the itinerary, it'll be fine, you'll do great.\u201d\nShe sighs, mentally rewriting tomorrow's plans. \u201cFine, but you're coming with me to discuss expanding the job agency with Minister Xu.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you two hated each other.\u201d\n\u201cNah, he's all right,\u201d she shrugs. \u201cWe don't agree on much, but he can be pretty sensible. We really connected while we were working on the first agency.\u201d\n\u201cHuh,\u201d Zuko muses, lingering on the roof as she walks through the door. \u201cLooks like you're settling in.\u201d\nKatara smiles. \u201cI am.\u201d\nact three: and it\u2019s my whole heart (burned but not buried this time)\n.\nKatara receives a letter from Aang a few days later, a week to the day before she and Zuko and a few others will leave for the Council of Four. It\u2019s fairly short, merely talking about matters he intends to bring up at the council, but he also asks if she would speak to him in private after she arrives.\nIt\u2019s with some trepidation that she agrees, although she thinks it\u2019s probably a step in the right direction, and it\u2019s nice that he asked this time, instead of waiting for the Council to start and then ambushing her.\nShe\u2019s not quite as anxious on the boat ride over this time as she was the last, and anyway she\u2019s got more to think about, since she\u2019s in something of a unique position this time \u2013 as an ambassador for two countries simultaneously, she\u2019s going to be occupying a place similar to Aang\u2019s, as a mediator and peacekeeper.\nToph greets them when they get to Ba Sing Se, waving at them to follow her.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still waiting on your brother,\u201d she tells them, \u201cand Aang. But Aang sent word that he was held up by something at the Air Temple, he shouldn\u2019t be much longer.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Sokka?\u201d Katara asks, but a bit deadpan, because she knows her brother, and she knows how he gets so invested in things that he loses track of time. Toph shrugs.\n\u201cI think his story is that the ship ran into trouble right around Kyoshi.\u201d She marks the word  trouble with air quotes and an eyeroll. \u201cEven though Suki\u2019s gonna be here, too. I guess he couldn\u2019t wait.\u201d\nKatara smiles; Sokka has been keeping her (somewhat) abreast of things, and apparently now that Suki doesn\u2019t have to go to the Fire Nation all the time, they\u2019ve been able to really rekindle their relationship. He\u2019s been really happy about it, and even confided in her that he\u2019s been trying to carve a pendant, only he is \u201cnot the greatest carver in the world, I know this shocks you to hear\u201d.\nShe really can\u2019t wait to see him again. It\u2019s strange, and it isn\u2019t at the same time, how much she\u2019s missed her big, goofy brother.\nThey've got a few hours to kill, since half the crew has yet to arrive, and after Toph gives them a somewhat-suspect tour of the Earth King's palace (\u201cBathrooms are over there, the East Wing is where the King lives so don't go there because the Dai Li will probably eat you, we'll be having all the meetings in the South Wing and the festivities in the West Wing, here are the kitchens and here is the wine. This concludes your tour.\u201d) they split up, Zuko saying that he's going to go check out the meeting room.\nAs such, Katara finds herself wandering around the place for the better part of an hour, a bit lost.\nIt's not quite as big as Zuko's palace, but it's more open, so it feels larger and more inviting; the color palate is also greener and bluer, but it somehow seems colder to her, with hard stone floors and sheer stone walls instead of the rugs and tapestries that adorn the palace at the Caldera. The art is pretty, though, with ink-and-water paintings that, although less colorful than Fire Nation art, have their own sort of beauty in their austerity.\nShe's admiring a painting of what is probably Oma and Shu, when Zuko startles her.\n\u201cThat was quite the tour Toph gave us,\u201d Zuko says in a strange voice, as he walks up to her from another hall. \u201cTurns out, the palace is circular. You can  think you're walking to the meeting hall but find yourself standing outside King Kuei's door and getting ambushed by him. He likes bears.\u201d\nKatara can't help it; she laughs out loud at this, a full-on, throwing-her-head-back-and-cackling peals of laughter. Zuko looks so blas\u00e9, and at the same time so harassed, that it brings tears of mirth to her eyes.\n\u201cAt least you didn't get eaten by the Dai Li,\u201d she chortles, and he shakes his head.\n\u201cI  did almost get eaten by Boscoe. Kuei mistook my manners for interest. Did you know that brown bears eat as much as 90 pounds of food per day?\u201d he asks, with an expression of pure fascination. She bites her lip, trying with little success to restrain her laughter. \u201cBoscoe doesn't have to eat as much, because he doesn't hibernate through the winter, but he makes up for it by eating all the time. In fact,\u201d he goes on brightly, \u201cKing Kuei spends more on feeding Boscoe than he does feeding himself.\u201d\n\u201cHow fascinating,\u201d Katara squeaks, and Zuko lets out a long-suffering sigh.\n\u201cI had to fake an allergy,\u201d he deadpans, running a hand over his face. \u201cIf Kuei asks, I'm deathly allergic to bears.\u201d\n\u201cGot it.\u201d\n\u201cYou laugh,\u201d he says darkly, \u201cbut wait until he catches you.\u201d\n\u201cI  like bears,\u201d she counters, shrugging airily, but he shakes his head.\n\u201cNobody  likes bears enough to listen to Kuei go on about them,\u201d he says, with feeling. \u201cI never  thought I hated them before a half-hour ago. Now I think they should be outlawed.\u201d\nShe laughs, and he rolls his eyes, but it\u2019s with over-exaggerated exasperation, and he can't quite hide his smile.\n\u201cBoscoe's sweet,\u201d she says, trying to contain herself, with more success than earlier. \u201cAnd Kuei means well. He's just\u2026 not good at talking to people.\u201d\n\u201cNo, Katara,\u201d Zuko counters, raising an eyebrow. \u201cI'm not good at talking to people. Kuei is an alien.\u201d\n\u201cHe's not an alien,\u201d she sighs, rolling her eyes. \u201cHe's just sheltered.\u201d\n\u201cYou always see the best in people, don't you?\u201d\nShe glances at him, and the humorous mood seems to evolve. \u201cI try to,\u201d she replies simply. \u201cSome people make it hard, but I like to see them for what they mean to be.\u201d She pauses, and thinks about this. \u201cSometimes that's \u201ca huge jerk\u201d but, well,\u201d she shrugs, \u201cyou can't win all the time.\u201d\nZuko laughs at this, the kind of sweet laugh that starts in the eyes and gravitates outward, and it's so warm in here, so she links arms with him and walks toward the nearest balcony.\n\u201cYou see the best in the ministers,\u201d he suggests as they step through the doors. \u201cEven though some of them were huge jerks to you at the start.\u201d\n\u201cIt's okay, you can say Xu,\u201d she says lightly, and he snickers. \u201cBut it's just a matter of perspective,\u201d she goes on seriously, thoughtfully. \u201cI thought at the start that none of them were loyal to you.\u201d\n\u201cThey're not,\u201d he sighs. \u201cI've tried to weed out everyone who sided with my father, but it's hard to know who to trust.\u201d\n\u201cI can't speak for all of them,\u201d she muses. \u201cBut I think mostly, they're loyal to the nation. It's\u2026 both good and bad.\u201d\n\u201cLoyal to the Fire Nation but not to the Fire Lord?\u201d he challenges, but he doesn't sound particularly questioning.\n\u201cExactly,\u201d she says, deliberately ignoring his tone. \u201cThey want the best for the nation: peace, prosperity, qualified freedoms. As long as that's you, they'll support you. But they'd turn on you if they thought someone else would be better.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you think this is a good thing?\u201d\nShe looks at him, startled. \u201cWell, yeah,\u201d she replies, a bit blunt because it's so obvious to her. \u201cBecause you are. The best for the nation, I mean,\u201d she adds, and turns away, looking out over the city. \u201cThey'll support you as long as you have the best interests of the Fire Nation at heart. And you do. So they'll be loyal to you.\u201d\n\u201cYou don't think they could be convinced that, say, Azula would be better?\u201d he counters, looking a bit sour, but she shakes her head.\n\u201cNo,\u201d she says firmly. \u201cAzula thrives in a war zone. The people on that council who've watched their children die in war, they don't want someone who doesn't know how to be at peace. They're  desperate  for peace, but they don't want it to come at the expense of their country's honor. That's where you come in,\u201d she goes on, tilting her head and looking back at him. \u201cYou set out on a journey to regain your honor \u2013 which, by the way, your father never had the power to take from you \u2013\u201d his face comes over sort of queer when she says this, but she barrels on without examining it \u201c \u2013 by bringing back the Avatar, which you did. But on  your terms, not his. You saw a warmonger deposed, and took the throne on the platform of stopping the fighting for good. Look, Zuko\u2026\u00a0\n\u201cYou're approaching this the wrong way,\u201d she says, turning full-on to him. \u201cYou think that it's you against them, and  trust me, I can see why, but it's not really. They  want  you to be the answer,\u201d she says very deliberately, leaning forward and making sure that he is listening to every syllable she is saying. \u201cThey  want  you to be the Fire Lord who brings the nation to peace and stability. Not just the ministers, but the rest of the nation, except for a few jerks in the nobility. They  want you to be the one who saves them and their place in the world. All you have to do is hang on and keep doing what you believe is right.\u201d\nHe doesn't reply for a while, and when he does it's in a strikingly small voice. \u201cI haven't exactly been the answer for them so far. That's why they don't really have faith in me.\u201d\n\u201cWell,  I  do,\u201d she snaps, with righteous force, and he looks up at her. \u201cI  believe in you. And I  know  that you are the answer they've spent a century looking for. You just have to know it, too. That's your biggest problem, Zuko,\u201d she adds, much softer. \u201cYou think you're not worthy of their faith, but you  are. You just have to trust yourself. You know what the right thing is. You know what they need. Maybe you don't know how to go about it,\u201d she goes on, agitated, gesticulating wildly, \u201cbut that isn't the important part, not really. We can figure  that out. What matters is that you have the right goal.\u201d\nZuko watches her for a moment longer, before turning away, blinking rapidly and swallowing hard. \u201cYou really believe in me?\u201d he murmurs.\n\u201cI really do,\u201d she replies quietly. \u201cI wouldn't be here if I didn't.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but,\u201d he starts, looking away from her, \u201chow  long will you be here?\u201d\nShe blinks, the only answer rising in her at the same time that she knows exactly what sort of thing she's getting herself into by saying it. \u201cAs long as you need me,\u201d she answers, and he glances back at her, then to the railing. \u201cI promise, Zuko,\u201d she goes on. \u201cI'm here, by your side, as long I have to be to see the world through this and onto a better future.\u201d\n\u201cIt may be a while,\u201d he says enigmatically.\n\u201cThen I'll be here a while,\u201d she replies, and meets his eyes.\n.\nAang ends up arriving just before dinner, and although he joins the group at the table, he sits far from her and doesn\u2019t look at her, instead conversing with Toph about something that appears to be serious, judging from their expressions.\n\u201cWhat do you think they\u2019re talking about?\u201d she asks Zuko, who\u2019s sitting beside her and looking kind of underwhelmed by the Earth Kingdom food.\n\u201cWho? Aang and Toph?\u201d he asks, glancing down the table and making a face. \u201cLooks serious. Probably something about the colonies, again.\u201d\nShe makes a face. \u201cUgh. Remember that \u201cno crappy politics at teatime\u201d rule? I think it should apply to all meals.\u201d\n\u201cI would be completely on-board with that,\u201d Zuko replies evenly. \u201cActually, I\u2019d be completely on-board with a \u201cno crappy politics, period\u201d rule, but I don\u2019t think I could get away with it.\u201d\nShe snickers. \u201cYeah, I think you\u2019re kind of stuck with it at this point. At least you\u2019ve got me,\u201d she adds, a bit more flippantly than she feels. \u201cI like the political stuff. Usually.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without you,\u201d he replies, with an over-dramatic sigh and a sidelong smirk at her. \u201cBesides go nuts.\u201d\nKatara glances at him, feeling the lightening of the mood but also the serious tone underneath. \u201cYou\u2019d be just fine,\u201d she says, and he glances at her.\n\u201cA wise person once told me that just fine isn\u2019t good enough,\u201d he replies, and she smiles.\n\u201cOnce?\u201d she scoffs, nudging him with her shoulder. \u201cThat was like two weeks ago.\u201d\n\u201cYou did say it once,\u201d he counters, lightning-fast, and she shakes her head, laughing a bit, \u201cit still counts.\u201d\nShe rolls her eyes, but can\u2019t stop smiling.\n.\nSokka is, of course, the last to arrive, just as the sun is setting on the western horizon. She greets him when he gets off the boat, shielding his eyes in the fiery light and scanning the docks until he sees her, and his face splits into a huge grin.\n\u201cKatara!\u201d he cries, dropping his back and opening his arms wide for a hug. She tries to maintain her stern, hands-on-hips glare, but she can\u2019t help but step forward and let him pull her into his arms.\n\u201cYou\u2019re  late,\u201d she accuses when she steps back, but the bite is taken away by her smile. \u201cYou missed dinner!\u201d\nHe rolls his eyes. \u201cI know, I know. But we really did run into trouble.\u201d\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d she replies, raising an eyebrow and he scoffs with exaggerated offense.\n\u201cI mean it! The Unagi hit us, I think it was hungry,\u201d he explains, picking his bag back up. \u201cIt didn\u2019t do a lot of damage, but we stopped for repairs anyway, because I have this thing where I don\u2019t like my boats sinking and drowning everyone.\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d she says airily, \u201cand it just  happened that you took damage right by Kyoshi.\u201d\nHe gives her a mock-glare, but it\u2019s ruined by his grin. \u201cMaybe the Unagi knew that true love was about to be reunited, and it couldn\u2019t wait.\u201d\nKatara laughs, and glances back up to the boat where Suki is still waving her warriors into formation.\n\u201cSo\u2026\u201d she starts, leaning forward, \u201chave you done it yet?\u201d\nSokka winces, and pulls out a misshapen lump of wood. \u201cNo, because this is how far I\u2019ve gotten on the pendant.\u201d\nShe bites her lip, trying not to laugh because she knows this is important to him, but it really does look rather sad. \u201cWhat were you going for?\u201d she asks, and he sighs, stuffing it back into his pocket.\n\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be a fan, you know, for Kyoshi, with the symbol of the Water Tribe under it, but\u2026 It\u2019s bad. You can say it, it looks awful.\u201d\nKatara hesitates, then reaches up to touch their mother\u2019s pendant at her own throat. She\u2019s not really using it, she thinks, and their mother would\u2026 she\u2019d like that.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you give her this one?\u201d she offers, and he looks surprised, then touched, but he reaches out a hand to stop her from taking it off.\n\u201cI appreciate it, Katara,\u201d he says sincerely, \u201cbut that\u2019s yours. You should keep it, and give it to your own kids someday.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s as much yours as it is mine,\u201d she counters. \u201cMom would have loved Suki, she would have been happy to see you give it to her.\u201d\n\u201cKatara,\u201d he says, taking her by both hands. \u201cI know how much it means to you to offer it, and I really do appreciate it, but I\u2019m not gonna take that away from you. I don\u2019t mind waiting until I\u2019ve carved the right pendant for Suki. Keep it.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d she replies, \u201cif you change your mind\u2026 the offer\u2019s open.\u201d\n\u201cIt means a lot to me,\u201d he says, and gives her a slightly watery smile.\n\u201cWhat are you two over here talking about so seriously?\u201d Suki asks loudly, shouldering her own bag and walking down the gangplank to meet them. Sokka jumps, and Katara makes a face.\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s gonna be a serious few days,\u201d she says, extracting herself from Sokka \u2013 who, she can\u2019t help but notice, takes the opportunity to discreetly brush a tear away \u2013 and walks over to hug Suki. \u201cNot much room for fun, at least unless we have another party this year.\u201d\n\u201cYou say that,\u201d Suki counters, laughing, \u201cbut I have good money on you dousing the Council again. Sokka thinks you won\u2019t do the same thing two years in a row, but I think you won\u2019t change a good thing when you find it.\u201d\nShe laughs out loud, shaking her head. \u201cI\u2019m hoping I don\u2019t have to!\u201d\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m hoping a thousand gold coins fall on the ground in front of me,\u201d Suki says, with a smile and an eyeroll. \u201cBut you know how all these stuffy ministers get. I hear you\u2019ve had your hands full in the Fire Nation with them, yourself.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting better,\u201d she replies, and Suki makes a face.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a better woman than I,\u201d she shudders. \u201cI thought I was going to punch some of them in the face more than once.\u201d\n\u201cBelieve me, I wanted to,\u201d she laughs. \u201cBut they\u2019re not as bad as I thought when I first got there.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe they just like you,\u201d Suki says, raising an eyebrow, and glances back at the boat where her warriors are filing onto the docks. One of them, which she recognizes as Ty Lee, standing next to a non-uniform-wearing Mai, waves with over-exaggerated motions, and Katara waves back. \u201cI gotta say, you did me a huge favor by going over there full-time. I never felt like I was actually accomplishing much except beating up terrible assassins.\u201d\n\u201cI actually haven\u2019t seen any assassins yet,\u201d she muses, wondering at that a bit, but Suki gives her an aside glance.\n\u201cYeah, well, you\u2019re famous, not just as a waterbender powerful enough to stop Azula, but also as the world\u2019s best healer. I doubt they\u2019ll stay gone for good,\u201d she adds, more seriously, \u201cbut they\u2019re probably walking more carefully with you there.\u201d\n\u201cDo you think the council is clear?\u201d she asks, and Suki sighs.\n\u201cAs far as I can tell,\u201d she replies. \u201cIt took a while for me to snoop on all of them enough to figure out where their loyalties are, but I think, between me and Zuko, and Mai for a while, that we got rid of all Ozai\u2019s fanatics. I mean, they\u2019re not all great,\u201d she adds, shrugging, \u201cbut I went out of my way to find people Ozai had dismissed. Some of those were because, you know, they weren\u2019t  incredibly competent, but mostly it was just because they\u2019d been loyal to Iroh. I figured that was a safe place to start. What do you think?\u201d\n\u201cI think you made the right call. At worst, I think some of them are, yeah, incompetent, or power-hungry, but at least they\u2019re probably not plotting his death.\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Sokka cuts in, joining them, \u201cthere\u2019s still a lot of people in the nobility who aren\u2019t on that council.\u201d\n\u201cOne thing at a time, Sokka,\u201d Katara says fervently, and Suki smiles, patting her on the shoulder.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got this,\u201d she tells her, with firm confidence that she isn\u2019t sure she deserves, and walks back to her warriors.\n\u201cIf you say so,\u201d she mutters to herself, and Sokka throws an arm around her shoulder.\n\u201cIf you won\u2019t trust Suki,\u201d he says softly, \u201cthen trust  me. You\u2019re doing great. You\u2019ve got this.\u201d\nKatara smiles.\n.\nThis time, it's Katara who finds Aang at the balcony two hours after dinner, looking over the city.\n\u201cHi,\u201d she says quietly, a bit hesitantly. He's grown a lot in the past year, she thinks; he's taller than she is now, and even has the start of a beard going. He looks at her with a slightly pained smile.\n\u201cThanks for coming to see me,\u201d he says, and she shrugs like it's nothing, it's easy. \u201cI wanted to\u2026\u201d he makes a frustrated noise and runs his hand over his head, and then goes on in a bit of a rush, \u201cI wanted to apologize for how I acted when we were together.\u201d\nShe tilts her head. \u201cAang, it wasn't your fault. You didn't do anything wrong.\u201d\n\u201cDon't say that if it's not true, Katara,\u201d he counters, sighing. \u201cYou always tell me that things aren't my fault, even when they are. I didn't realize I was holding you back, but I was. I'm really sorry about that. I hope you can forgive me.\u201d\n\u201cOf course I forgive you,\u201d she says, walking forward to join him, leaning against the railing. \u201cYou never meant anything but the best, and I should have said something a lot sooner,\u201d she says softly, and he nods, glancing away.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he replies, sounding kind of hurt. \u201cYou really should have. It really hurt when you said that you thought we never should have gotten together in the first place.\u201d\n\u201cI was wrong about that,\u201d she says, closing her eyes. \u201cJust because it didn't work out doesn't mean that it was a mistake. No love is wasted,\u201d she adds, thinking about Ty Lee's words and how true they were.\n\u201cYou really did love me, then?\u201d he asks, and she glances at him.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d she replies simply, and he takes a deep breath.\n\u201cYou said that,\u201d he starts, sounding hesitant, and something in her sinks right through the stone floor, \u201cin the future, maybe we could  work  together.\u201d He turns to her, eyes wide and imploring and reaching right into her heart and tugging with all their might. \u201cMaybe that future is now,\u201d he says softly, and it reverberates in her head like a glacier cracking into a thousand icebergs. \u201cWe know where things went wrong in the past,  I  know where  I went wrong. We won't make the same mistakes, we're older and I think we've both learned a lot about ourselves and our place in the world. I still love you, Katara,\u201d he goes on, looking down and looking so nervous, so vulnerable, that it rips her insides to shreds all over again. \u201cI've missed you so much, I just\u2026 I just want to be with you, always.\u201d\nMaybe he can see her hesitation, maybe he can sense it, maybe he always knew he was just getting his hopes up to have them dashed, because he sighs and reaches out, taking her by the hand. She lets him, but doesn't return the pressure.\n\u201cAt least consider it, Katara, please?\u201d he implores, voice cracking a little on the  please and cracking her heart.\nShe is so, so tired of hurting him.\nHe squeezes her hand once more and lets go, starts to walk away, to give her the space she once asked him for, all those years ago on Ember Island, the space he hadn't given her then \u2013 and a tiny part of her thinks that maybe it's a sign, he really has learned, he really does mean it.\nBut she promised Zuko she would be by his side for the duration, and she's not foolish enough to believe that such a promise can coexist with a relationship with Aang.\n(Part of her thinks she's using that as an excuse for the more primal reason: she simply doesn't want to.)\n\u201cI don't need to consider it,\u201d she tells him, clenching her jaw and hearing him stall at the door. \u201cI already know.\u201d\nShe doesn't look back, but she can see him turning in her mind's eye, see the hope she's about to crush in his eyes, and it  hurts .\n\u201cI am happy where I am now,\u201d she says deliberately. \u201cI don't want to go back. I'm sorry, Aang,\u201d she chokes. \u201cI will always love you, but I don't think it's the same way you love me.\u201d\n\u201cYou won't even consider it?\u201d he asks, voice breaking with tears she can't wipe away. \u201cIt wouldn't be going back, it would be  starting over  . We could start over, on the same page this time. You and me, side by side, making the whole world better. You're so good at this, Katara,\u201d he chokes, and she bites her lip, eyes burning and vision blurring as she wills herself not to cry. \u201cYou're such an amazing diplomat, I can't believe I never saw it before. If we were together, we could be\u2026 we could be  incredible, for the whole world. Why won't you even  consider it?\u201d\nThe half-lie about her promise to Zuko is on her lips, but she makes the mistake of turning to him and seeing the devastation in his eyes, and she knows that there is no sense in false hope. It was her being weak then and giving him false hope that led them to this in the first place.\n\u201cBecause I don't want it, Aang,\u201d she breathes, closing her eyes and feeling the hot tears run down her face. \u201cI don't want to be your girlfriend. I don't want to spend my life in your shadow.\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn't overshadow you!\u201d he cries. \u201cThat's what I'm trying to  tell you! I know I did before, I know it was wrong!\u201d\n\u201cYou would still overshadow me, Aang,\u201d she chokes. \u201cYou wouldn't mean to, but you  would.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you think that?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I want to say  yes!\u201d  she cries, finally looking at him and wishing there was still an ocean between them. \u201cBut not because it's what I want, just because I'm sick of hurting you. I  do  love you, you're the person who taught me to have hope and be free and enjoy life, you'll always mean the world to me. But I don't  want  to be in a relationship with you,\u201d she articulates, swallowing hard and taking a deep, ragged breath. \u201cI  can't be in a relationship with you, I'm always ceding ground to you.\u201d\n\u201cYou won't even  try?\u201d \nShe closes her eyes tight and shakes her head, thinking of her own words: better an unpleasant truth than a sweet lie. \u201cI would have hated you, Aang,\u201d she whispers. \u201cIf I had stayed with you, I would have hated you in the end, because I barely had the strength to leave then, even though I was miserable. I can't be honest with you, I know you say that I should be able to but that doesn't  matter  because I  can't. I can't even  look at you right now.\u201d\nThere's a pause, before he says, in a cold and watery voice, \u201cI never had you pegged for a coward before, Katara,\u201d and leaves, shutting the door behind him with a resounding  bang that makes her flinch.\n There it goes, she thinks darkly.  There goes the one person who believed you were perfect.\n And good riddance, another part of her hisses.\nShe thinks, a bit traitorously, that she should have lied.\n.\nToph didn't give them much information about the upper floors of the palace, because they wouldn't be open to the council members, but this is why Katara goes to them: probably no one will be there, and she will be able to be alone.\nShe's halfway to hysteria as it is, and the  last thing she needs is for someone to see her like this.\nShe finds a drawing room in a secluded corner of the north wing, and barrels through it like an avalanche, so quickly and with so much force that she doesn't even realize someone is already there. She's standing at a little table, taking in deep lungfuls of air and choking on her own sobs, when the other person speaks.\n\u201cI'll just go, then,\u201d Mai says, and Katara jumps, looking up at her with an expression that she's sure looks completely insane, before turning back away, horrified that  Mai of all people is the one who saw her.\nIn retrospect, it makes sense: Katara came here to be alone; it's not unreasonable to think that Mai, trying to be fine in the face of Zuko's presence here, might have had the same goal.\nShe hears the footsteps retreating, but out of the corner of her eye, she sees Mai hesitate by the door.\n\u201cWhat\u2026 happened?\u201d she asks tentatively, and Katara runs a hand over her face.\n\u201cIt's\u2026 Aang,\u201d she chokes, trying to breathe but finding it unreasonably difficult.\nMai pauses. \u201cHe\u2026 didn't want to get back together?\u201d she offers, sounding uncertain, and Katara shakes her head.\n\u201cHe  did,\u201d she replies, sniffling. \u201cHe wanted to try again, to\u2026  start over,  \u201d she spits the words out with more force than is necessary. \u201cI don't  want  to start over. I  like my life just the way it is.\u201d\nThere's another pause. \u201cSo\u2026 you're crying because\u2026?\u201d\nShe looks up, gaping at Mai, who is standing beside the door with one eyebrow raised, the only concession someone like Mai could give to confusion.\n\u201cI'm so  sick  of hurting him!\u201d she cries, choking on her tears. \u201cIt's like that's all I've done, he saved the world and all he ever wanted was me and I just can't  stop hurting him!\u201d\nIn the ringing silence, she runs a shaking hand through her hair, and Mai makes a strange noise.\n\u201cLet me get this straight,\u201d she drawls. \u201cYou're upset because he wanted to get back with you, which you  don't want, and you turned him down, which hurt him. And now you're crying alone in a tacky drawing room because you chose not to be someone else's prize for saving the world?\u201d\nShe swallows hard and glares, wondering why she expected Mai to understand.\n\u201cI do  care  about him, you know?\u201d she snarls, taking in a deep, shaky breath. \u201cCaring, it's something most  humans do.\u201d\nMai doesn't take the bait, and Katara is a bit irritated by this, since she's now itching for a fight. \u201cFor the love of Agni and all his dumb children,\u201d Mai snaps, rolling her eyes, \u201che's  sixteen. When I was sixteen, the guy I thought was the love of my life dumped me in a  letter. He'll get over it.\u201d\nKatara hesitates, feeling a bit stupid in the face of Mai's deadpan deconstruction of the thing that's currently turned her life upside-down.\n\u201cAnd,  furthermore,\u201d Mai goes on, folding her hands into her sleeves, \u201che was a real jerk for dumping all this on you right now.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she asks, and Mai raises that eyebrow again.\n\u201cIt's the Council of Four, in case you hadn't noticed,\u201d she says sardonically. \u201cIt's the single most important three days of the year, at least for people like you and Zuko and Aang, and the  last  thing anyone in the  world needs is for anyone to be distracted by their dumb personal crap right now.\u201d\nShe wants to say something about how it's  not  dumb personal crap, it's love and the whole future, but at the same time\u2026 it  is kind of dumb in comparison to the things they're supposed to be here to discuss.\n\u201cLook, Katara,\u201d Mai continues, stepping forward, \u201cyou don't have time for this. The Fire Nation \u2013 the  world   \u2013  needs you to be  on  tomorrow morning, no matter how late you stay up tonight crying over some stupid teenager with delusions of true love. That's what you signed up for when you shacked up with Zuko,\u201d she adds, and heat rises to her face at the implication, but Mai doesn't give her the opportunity to deny it. \u201cIf you're not willing to do it, then you need to get the hell out of here  now, because you're just gonna make everything worse.\u201d\nAlmost against her will, the antagonistic, \u201cIs that what  you did?\u201d slips out of her mouth before she can stop it. She's just stinging from Mai's tone, and still from Aang's when he left her on the balcony.\n(It seems so long ago, when she and Zuko were laughing about Boscoe.)\n\u201cYes,\u201d Mai replies simply, shrugging. \u201cThat  is  what I did. I didn't want to be Fire Lady, I hated everything about it, and loving Zuko wasn't enough to justify staying there and doing all that crap. But you're all about the political stuff,\u201d she goes on, rolling her eyes again and waving a hand irritably. \u201cYou've got all these  plans  about improving the world. I really thought  better of you than this.\u201d\nIt hits her like a slap in the face.\nShe wonders distantly just what Zuko decided to write in his letter to her.\nShe swallows hard, looks away, and takes a deep, even breath. \u201cYou're right,\u201d she says, rubbing at her face angrily. \u201cI need to be focusing on the Council, not on Aang. I\u2026 I just didn't expect this.\u201d\n\u201cWhich, again, makes  him  the asshole here, not  you.\u201d\n\u201cAang isn't an asshole,\u201d she says, kind of dejected, and Mai shakes her head. \u201cHe just loves me more than I love him.\u201d\n\u201cLove makes people do stupid things,\u201d Mai tells her. \u201cIt even makes nice people act like assholes.\u201d\nIt's an entirely different perspective than anything she would have even dreamed of, and although she definitely still feels like a horrible person for shutting him down, it  was kind of short-sighted on his part, to dump all this on her right when she most needed to be focused. Maybe he just couldn't wait; but then, even if she had just fallen right back into his arms, she would have had to jump straight back into politics and ignore their romantic reunion, so what was he really hoping for here?\nStill, the image of his face \u2013 crushed and shattered, with his image of her on that pedestal he'd always kept her on crumbling to the ground \u2013 haunts her.\n\u201cHe'll get over it,\u201d Mai repeats, opening the door. \u201cBut even if he doesn't, his feelings aren't your problem.\u201d\nShe looks up.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she says suddenly, and Mai raises an eyebrow. \u201cFor listening.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d she sighs. \u201cJust don't let this get in your way tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cIt won't.\u201d\nMai looks at her, sizing her up for a moment, before giving her the tiniest of smiles. \u201cGood.\u201d\n.\n\n He'll get over it, but even if he doesn't, his feelings aren't your problem. \n\n\n Don't worry about everyone else. They'll come around or they won't, but you shouldn't wait on them to get on with your life. \n\n\n I never had you pegged for a coward before. \n\n\n You did him a favor in the long run. \n\nIt all echoes in her head and drowns out the exhaustion that lurks under her skin once the tears have washed themselves out. Everyone has an opinion, everyone has advice, everyone has something to tell her about how she should respond.\nIt's all meant well, sure, but it's driving her slowly insane.\nShe gives up on sleep altogether \u2013 it's closer to dawn than midnight, anyway, she'd be doing more harm than good trying to rest at this point \u2013 and goes to the kitchens Toph pointed out, taking care not to wake any of the servants as she makes herself a pot of tea, but she's brought up short by the fact that the kettle is already hot.\nSomeone else is awake.\nBut the kitchen is deathly silent, and anyway, she doesn't really want to talk to anyone right now, so she decides not to question it, not to go looking. Just drink her tea and maybe eat a mango or something and begrudgingly decide to welcome the dawn.\nShe gingerly sets the pot and cup onto a tray and takes it out into the nearest courtyard, but her luck is both with her and not with her \u2013 the early-rising tea-drinker is sitting out there, obvious in silhouette.\nReally, she should have expected it as soon as she noticed the kettle.\nHe turns, hearing her before she can sneak back out, and his face splits into a jovial grin.\n\u201cLady Katara!\u201d Uncle Iroh beams, beckoning her over to him, and his good cheer is infectious enough that she's torn between wanting to join him and wanting to leave him so she can sulk in peace. \u201cYou're up early this morning.\u201d\n\u201cSo are you,\u201d she replies, giving up and walking over to sit next to him. \u201cI only brought one cup,\u201d she starts, but he waves her off, and anyway he has his own cup and pot of tea next to him.\n\u201cAt my age, sleep neither comes easily nor lasts long,\u201d he says, and pours himself a cup from his own pot. It smells much better than the tea she's made for herself \u2013 a simple collection of as many black tea leaves as she could cram into the basket \u2013 but of course, it would. \u201cBut you should be abed! You've got quite the day ahead of you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026 couldn't sleep,\u201d she answers, hoping that the low light is sufficient to hide her puffy eyes. She hasn't really thought about what she's going to do about that in the actual morning, when the sun is up and everyone can see her. \u201cNerves, I guess,\u201d she goes on, laughing and hoping it sounds more convincing to him than it does to her.\n\u201cNonsense,\u201d he says, waving a hand. \u201cYou've nothing to be worried over. According to my nephew, you're the best thing that's happened to the Fire Nation in centuries! Not in so many words, of course,\u201d he adds, eyes twinkling in the dim torch- and starlight, and she can't help but smile. \u201cBut he speaks very highly of you and your prowess as a politician.\u201d\nThere's some sort of undercurrent to his words, something in the vein of  I know you're lying, and she wonders if he can tell she's been crying.\nShe looks down and pours herself a cup of tea, drinking it probably faster than she should. And that's when she knows that he's waiting for her to open up to him and explain why she\u2019s upset, because Uncle Iroh would  absolutely have commented on her shooting dull black tea like it's hard liquor otherwise.\n\u201cAang wanted to get back together,\u201d she finds herself telling him, even though it wasn't quite what she opened her mouth to say. The tea has left a bitter sensation in her mouth, burning and drying at the same time.\n\u201cAh,\u201d he replies, drawing out the syllable and taking a sip of his tea. \u201cThat is the peril of young love: it does not understand letting go.\u201d\n\u201cI really wish he would get the picture,\u201d she sighs, shivering in spite of the warm weather. \u201cI'm so sick of hurting him.\u201d\n\u201cSome hurts are unavoidable,\u201d he says. \u201cHe will learn peace in time, as will you.\u201d\n\u201cThat's what Mai said,\u201d she mutters, a bit mulish in her determination to be upset still. \u201cThat he'd get over it. But I thought that two years ago, and here we are. He thinks we're destined for each other.\u201d\n\u201cDestiny is a funny thing,\u201d he replies thoughtfully. \u201cWhat may seem so clear to you at dawn may turn out to be an illusion by midmorning.\u201d He looks at her sideways. \u201cTake my nephew, for example. For years, he was convinced that his destiny was to capture the Avatar for the Fire Nation and regain his place beneath his father's iron fist. It took a great deal of upheaval for him to realize the truth. Those sorts of revelations never come painlessly, my lady,\u201d he adds, somewhat apologetically. \u201cBut in the end, we are always better for having had them.\u201d\n\u201cEveryone's full of advice,\u201d she grumbles. \u201cBut it seems like they don't really know what I'm feeling.\u201d\n\u201cAsk Zuko,\u201d Uncle Iroh says seriously, and she glances at him a bit critically. \u201cI am serious, Lady Katara, Zuko  does know this pain. He and Lady Mai spent years trying to force their relationship to work, ultimately hurting the both of them far more than they would have had they walked away when it first failed.\u201d\n\u201cMai didn't seem to understand very well,\u201d she counters, but then she thinks about it a bit more, and wonders if maybe she did, and maybe that was  why she was harsh.\n\u201cMai herself is difficult to understand,\u201d he says, as though reading her thoughts. \u201cI doubt she would be very open to discussing such a painful time with a near-stranger. But you and Zuko are close, from what I hear,\u201d he goes on, and she tells herself that she's imagining the slight innuendo in his tone. \u201cI think he would be open to discussing this with you.\u201d\nBut talking about romantic entanglements with Zuko seems\u2026 dangerous.\n\u201cI feel like this is the wrong time for all this,\u201d she mutters, Mai's words about Aang being an asshole for bringing this up now ringing in her ears. \u201cWe shouldn't be focused on\u2026 personal stuff, there's so much more going on.\u201d\n\u201cAlas,\u201d Uncle Iroh sighs, \u201cthe heart is a selfish beast. It does not choose an appropriate time to make its demands.\u201d\n\u201cThe heart may not, but  Aang should have,\u201d she cries, louder and with more feeling than she intends.\n\u201cAvatar Aang is a young man ruled by his heart,\u201d he counters softly, without any apparent reproach. \u201cIt makes him an effective peacemaker and well-loved by the people, but it is not without its downsides.\u201d\nShe doesn't want to let go of the anger that Mai gifted her with \u2013 when she's angry with him, she doesn't have the space in her head to remember how crushed he looked. But all of her anger crumbles in the face of Iroh's good-natured kindness.\n\u201cI thought he wanted to make amends,\u201d she says quietly, running her hand over her face. \u201cWhen he wrote to me asking to speak in private, I thought it was because he was ready to be friends again.  I was ready to be friends again.\u201d\nUncle Iroh pats her sympathetically on the knee. \u201cIt will pass, Lady Katara, and you will find yourself stronger for it.\u201d Maybe he can see that she\u2019s in no mood to be comforted, because he gives her a soft smile. \u201cYou should rest. It will be a long day.\u201d\n\u201cBreakfast is only a couple of hours away,\u201d she sighs. \u201cI\u2019d just be doing more harm than good.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d he counters, raising a finger, \u201cbut the meetings do not start until after mid-morning. You could still achieve four or five hours of sleep.\u201d\nShe thinks about it for a moment, but she isn\u2019t sure; although she doesn\u2019t feel much better, she does feel less scattered and stretched-thin, so maybe she will be able to fall asleep. But she doesn\u2019t want to waste hours trying, only to get a half-hour of sleep and wake up feeling worse.\n\u201cTake it from an old man,\u201d he says softly, \u201cyou  will feel better after sleeping.\u201d\nShe takes a deep breath and runs a hand through her hair. \u201cI guess you\u2019re right,\u201d she mumbles. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be falling asleep in the middle of a meeting, after all.\u201d\n\u201cExactly,\u201d Iroh says, and then waves her off as she starts to gather up her teapot. \u201cAllow me to take care of this, my lady. I\u2019ll send someone to wake you in time for the meetings. Get some rest, now.\u201d\nShe smiles at him a little wanly, and goes back to her room; she doesn\u2019t change clothes or even turn down the blankets again, instead kicking her shoes off and falling onto the bed, where she holds the spare pillow to her chest like a lover, and falls into a deep and dreamless sleep.\n.\nThe first thing she becomes aware of is the knocking on the door.\nThe second thing is that her mouth feels like it\u2019s filled with dirty cotton, and the third is that she is fully-clothed on top of the covers of her bed. It takes her a moment to remember why: the tea, Uncle Iroh\u2019s advice\u2026 Aang.\n\u201cCome in,\u201d she says muzzily, sitting up and blinking in the bright morning sunlight. The door opens tentatively and \u2013 of course, she thinks, she should have expected this from the meddling old coot \u2013 Zuko leans in a little bit, keeping his eyes carefully averted.\n\u201cKatara?\u201d he asks, and she staggers to her feet, taking a bit longer still to return to consciousness. \u201cUncle asked me to wake you, he said you were up really late.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d she replies, shaking her head and still blinking rapidly. \u201cYou can come in.\u201d\n\u201cI saved you breakfast,\u201d he says, stepping through the door and holding out a tray with a pot of tea and a cup, as well as a plate of fruit and rice balls. \u201cAre\u2026 you okay?\u201d\nShe looks up a bit dumbly at his tone, and then down at herself, wincing: her dress is rumpled from sleeping in it, her hair feels as though a bird or seven set up a nest near the back of her neck, and her eyes are still swollen from all of last night\u2019s crying. She definitely doesn\u2019t look like she\u2019s having the best day ever.\nBut on the other hand\u2026 the tea smells sweet and strong, undoubtedly one of Iroh\u2019s recipes, and there\u2019s what looks like a whole mango sliced on the plate, and the rice balls are dusted with lotus seeds and stuffed with red beans, and the morning air is breezy and the sky is bright blue and wide open through the window\u2026 And damn him, Iroh was right, she  does feel better.\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she replies, taking the tray from him with an awkward cringe, \u201conce I clean up a little, sorry.\u201d\n\u201cUncle\u2026 said you seemed upset,\u201d he starts hesitantly, looking concerned. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d\nShe looks up at him, hesitates a half-second, and then smiles. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you about it later,\u201d she replies quietly. \u201cWe\u2019ve got more important things to deal with today.\u201d\nZuko doesn\u2019t seem convinced, but he lets it go. \u201cAt least we\u2019re not dealing with the colonies until tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cAnd thank  all of the spirits that have ever been for that,\u201d she says fervently, popping a rice ball into her mouth and setting the tray down on the bedside table. Zuko laughs a bit, and rubs the back of his neck, watching her with what looks like trepidation as she pours a cup. She raises a questioning eyebrow at him, and he coughs, wincing.\n\u201cI made the tea,\u201d he admits. \u201cIt\u2019s Uncle\u2019s recipe, so it\u2019s probably fine, but\u2026 it may not be great.\u201d\nShe lets out a small laugh. \u201cIt can\u2019t be worse than the tea I made myself this morning,\u201d she says, and takes a sip. It is good, some kind of earthy, vaguely floral black tea. \u201cWhat kind is it?\u201d\n\u201cJasmine and ginseng,\u201d he replies, still rubbing the back of his neck nervously. \u201cUncle swears by it.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s good,\u201d she tells him, and he smiles. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in the meeting hall,\u201d she goes on, gesturing at herself to indicate the need to dress appropriately, and he starts.\n\u201cRight, yeah. Don\u2019t, um\u2026 Don\u2019t get lost.\u201d\nKatara laughs a bit at that. \u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d she says. \u201cThank you for the breakfast, and the tea.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d he replies, still looking awkward, and backs out of the room, wincing a little.\nAlone in the room with her thoughts, she stands still for a long moment, closing her eyes and centering herself.\n Don\u2019t let this get in your way, Mai warned her.\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d she says again, to herself, and nods firmly.\n.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Toph murmurs to her as they take their seats at the table. Katara glances at her, surprised. \u201cI tried to talk him out of it.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d is all she can think to say, and then: \u201cHow is he?\u201d\nToph shrugs, a bitter twist to her lips. \u201cUpset. Said some things I doubt he really means, but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHe doesn't want anything to do with me,\u201d she finishes for her, and Toph winces.\n\u201cGive him time,\u201d she says. \u201cHe  will get over it.\u201d\nShe hesitates, glancing down the table to where Aang is sitting, and although he isn't scowling, he isn't smiling, either. Mai\u2019s words rattle around in her head.\nBut instead of everything she'd like to say, she settles on, \u201cI hope so.\u201d\n.\nUltimately, it's better than last year, when Aang was so frustrated with her that he couldn't focus; instead, he treats her like a stranger, which hurts Katara more but is better for everyone else.\nThe first day of the Council runs relatively smooth, since the main focus is on trade between the nations, and mostly a simple task to hash out. The first tentative year of open-borders trading has been pretty successful, although not as wildly as she and Sokka sort of hoped it would be, and the Earth Kingdom \u2013 this being their first real meeting with the Water Tribe since the last council \u2013 is eager to discuss the expansion of their textile trade, whereas Katara and Minister Lian have pretty much handled the Fire Nation\u2019s trade already.\n\u201cIt seems a bit unfair, really,\u201d Lady Jiayi of Omashu points out, glancing sideways at Minister Lian, \u201cthat the Fire Nation has its own live-in Ambassador from the Water Tribe, whereas the Earth Kingdom has to make do with these yearly meetings.\u201d\nKatara hesitates, unsure how to tackle this (particularly with her sleep deprivation starting to catch up with her), but Lian takes the lead on it.\n\u201cThe difference lies in centrality,\u201d Minister Lian responds smoothly. \u201cThe Lady Katara is only one person, and can only be in one place at one time, whereas the Earth Kingdom would require her presence in several major cities at once, or, alternatively, a series of ambassadors to work with each city individually, thus depriving the Water Tribe itself of many of its own key politicians.\u201d\nShe wants to point out that, also, Zuko really needs her help a lot more than the Earth Kingdom does, but that would make the Fire Nation appear weak; she has to go at it from another angle.\n\u201cMoreover,\u201d Katara adds slowly, \u201cthe Fire Nation is in the middle of a transition from a military industry to a production industry, which is a delicate process. Fire Lord Zuko \u2013\u201d she nods at him \u201c\u2013 and I both thought that the inclusion of a member of another culture may help aid in smoothing that transition, as well as showing the world as a whole that the Water Tribe does not bear ill will toward the Fire Nation for the war.\u201d\n\u201cI note that he never requested the aid of any Earth Kingdom diplomats,\u201d Lady Jiayi starts, but Zuko, apparently thinking fast, steps in.\n\u201cAs a matter of fact,\u201d he says, glancing down the table, \u201cI have actually recently requested the aid of Lady Bei Fong, although I\u2019ve yet to receive a response.\u201d\nKatara is surprised; if he actually did this, and isn\u2019t lying through his teeth to prevent any more fighting with the Earth Kingdom dignitaries than tomorrow is sure to bring, he never mentioned it to her.\n\u201cYeah, about that,\u201d Toph drawls, waving a hand in front of her face. \u201cI couldn\u2019t exactly read the letter myself, and my mother took issue with the idea of me leaving the Earth Kingdom. It turned into a fight. In other news, I\u2019m going back to the Fire Nation with you.\u201d\nZuko pinches the bridge of his nose; Aang, she notes, does almost the exact same thing.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t wish to cause any tension with Gaoling\u2026\u201d Katara starts, hoping to convey through her tone how bad an idea this may turn out to be, but Toph shrugs.\n\u201cI mean, they already know I\u2019m doing it,\u201d she replies, and Katara glances sideways at Zuko, inadvertently catching his eye, and his surprise.\nHe totally  was bluffing. But now the ball is in Toph\u2019s court, and while Toph can certainly be counted on to have their backs \u2013 she didn\u2019t rat him out, for one thing \u2013 she isn\u2019t exactly the reigning champion of tact or discretion.\n\u201cWell, in that case,\u201d Zuko says brightly, all traces of surprise and concern gone by the time he looks up to the rest of the table, \u201cI would be happy to have you accompany us to the Caldera. If the present ministers have no objection\u2026\"\nXu glances between Katara and Toph, then takes a deep breath. \u201cI will admit that I objected to the addition of the Lady Katara, and found myself proven wrong, so, in the interest of not making the same mistake of mistrusting the Fire Lord\u2019s judgment, I have no objection this time.\u201d\nKatara bites her tongue and wants to melt through the floor.\nBut Toph gives Xu a beatific smile. \u201cI promise,\u201d she says fervently, \u201cyou won\u2019t regret it.\u201d\n.\n\u201cSo,\u201d she murmurs to Zuko at the dinner table after the day\u2019s meetings have concluded, \u201cthat went\u2026 well. It\u2019ll be nice to have Toph around.\u201d\nZuko coughs, and winces. \u201cIt was a few months ago, but I  did  actually ask her to come and stay for a while,\u201d he says, as though defending himself, \u201cto help deal with the assassins. She said she couldn\u2019t leave at the time, but she\u2019d come visit whenever she got the chance. So. It wasn\u2019t entirely a lie.\u201d\n\u201cHey, I\u2019m not judging,\u201d she replies airily, and then cringes. \u201cI do worry about her on the Council with Xu, though.\u201d\n\u201cI was trying very hard to forget all about that, thanks.\u201d\nKatara laughs a little, and pats him on the shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019ll be all right. Toph can be\u2026 well, Toph, but she knows how to act like an adult, too. And hey, it does send a strong message about unity, like I mentioned.\u201d\n\u201cNice save there, by the way,\u201d he comments, and she makes a face.\n\u201cThank you, it was made up entirely on the spot.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d he says, smirking at her sideways, \u201cwasn\u2019t that the same way it was with your trade deal with them last year?\u201d\n\u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d she deadpans, struggling not to laugh, and he nods once, slowly.\n\u201cSure you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cNope, not a clue.\u201d\nThey fall into a companionable silence as the servants bring out the first course: a light, clear soup with Earth Kingdom vegetables, paired with a yellow wine she\u2019s never heard of before but finds herself falling in love with all the same.\n\u201cYou like this stuff?\u201d Zuko asks, delicately placing his glass back down with what looks like intense effort not to wince.\n\u201cI do,\u201d she replies, with some defiance.\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 very dry,\u201d he says magnanimously, and she shrugs.\n\u201cI like dry wines,\u201d she counters, glancing around to see if anyone is watching before pouring the contents of his glass into her own and taking another drink. The reason is twofold: for one, she likes the taste, but also whenever her mind stops, the image of Aang\u2019s crushed expression rises up in her eyes.\nZuko watches her for a moment, and she gives him a (slightly-exaggerated, she can admit) look of offense.\n\u201cWhat? You didn\u2019t want it.\u201d\nHe meets her eyes, and she knows he\u2019s thinking of how disheveled she looked this morning, and how she wouldn\u2019t tell him what was wrong, and how his uncle had told him she was upset but now she\u2019s pretending that nothing is wrong\u2026\n\u201cLater,\u201d she murmurs, and takes another drink, looking up and away to prevent the tears from coming back.\n\u201cIf you say so,\u201d he says, but still sounds concerned.\nThe next course comes out with a wine that Zuko likes too much to let her take, or else he\u2019s just pretending to enjoy it so as not to inadvertently enable her bad decision; it\u2019s a little sweeter than the previous, but a deeper orange-red color that she is \u2013 in her tipsy state \u2013 fascinated with.\nBy the time the main dish comes out, Katara is drunk enough to talk to him about it. After all, Uncle Iroh had said he would understand, right?\n\u201cAang wanted to get back together,\u201d she tells him in a low voice, and he looks at her with an unreadable expression.\n\u201cBut you promised me that you\u2019d stay in the Fire Nation,\u201d he infers, sounding somewhat dejected, but if there\u2019s a good reason for it, it goes over her head.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not it,\u201d she sighs. \u201cI just didn\u2019t want to. I probably should have told him that instead, though,\u201d she goes on, picking at her plate a bit miserably. \u201cI decided to be honest with him, and now he hates me.\u201d\n\u201cI doubt very much that Aang could ever hate you,\u201d Zuko says, and she shakes her head.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t see the look on his face,\u201d she mutters darkly. \u201cLike I\u2026 wasn\u2019t who he thought I was.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d he starts, rubbing the back of his neck and taking a large gulp of wine himself, \u201cAang has never exactly had the most\u2026 accurate perception of you. Not that you\u2019re bad, or anything, I didn\u2019t mean\u2026\u201d\nHe looks away, cringing hard, but she just sighs again.\n\u201cNo, he thought I was perfect,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd\u2026 it was just too much pressure. I couldn\u2019t go back to\u2026 pretending. Even though he seemed to think it wouldn\u2019t be that way anymore,\u201d she goes on, agitated, waving a hand and snatching her glass back up. \u201cBut the fact that he was so upset when I was honest with him tells me it would have been. Right?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe?\u201d he replies uncertainly, wincing again. \u201cHe may have thought he had it figured out, but that kind of thing is pretty hard to get over. Or he may have just been upset because you turned him down. It\u2019s hard to say.\u201d\nShe glances at him. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to say yes,\u201d she mumbles, the alcohol chasing the words out, and Zuko raises an eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to make me feel better.\u201d\n\u201cHow\u2019s this?\u201d he offers, face softening as he leans in a little bit. \u201cYou made the right decision. You break up with someone, then you remember how much you cared about them, and so you get back together only to remember why you broke up in the first place, but now it hurts more because you both had all this  hope riding on it. You thought you could beat the odds and get it right this time, but it never seems to work like that. It\u2019s better to just let it go when it\u2019s over, because you\u2019ve already lost what you had, and you can\u2019t get it back.\u201d\n\u201cBut I  really hurt him,\u201d she whispers, and her vision is blurry, so she tries to clear it with another drink; it doesn\u2019t work.\n\u201cIt would have hurt him more if you\u2019d gotten back together, only to break up again later.  Trust me on that, Katara,\u201d he adds, with feeling. \u201cAang will be okay. He\u2019s stronger than he looks.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019ll ever forgive me for this,\u201d she says, thinking about exactly what she said to him, that she would have hated him in the end \u2013 and why, why,  why did that seem like a good idea? \u2013 but Zuko simply nudges her with his shoulder.\n\u201cYou said the same thing about me,\u201d he counters, and when she looks up at him, he gives her a hesitant smile. \u201cAnd Aang is  way more forgiving than I am.\u201d\nShe returns the smile, albeit weakly. \u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d she replies, although she doesn\u2019t quite believe it. After all, Aang\u2019s feelings run a lot deeper than Zuko\u2019s did when she hurt him.\n\u201cYou remember how you told me that everything would work out?\u201d he goes on, apparently hearing her hesitation in her tone or seeing it on her face. \u201cBecause you were on my side, I wasn\u2019t alone in the Fire Nation anymore?\u201d\n\u201cYes\u2026\u201d she mumbles.\n\u201cWell, it goes both ways,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re on my side, I\u2019m on yours. We\u2019re in this together.\u201d\nShe sighs. \u201cThis is a lot\u2026 less important than all of that.\u201d\n\u201cNot really,\u201d he replies. \u201cI mean, to them, maybe,\u201d he adds, gesturing around the table, \u201cbut to you, it\u2019s just as important, and it affects you just as much. It doesn\u2019t matter any less just because it\u2019s personal.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the wrong time for all this, anyway,\u201d she says, a bit hastily, and takes a gulp of wine to drown out an unidentifiable emotion rising in her chest. Zuko shrugs.\n\u201cMaybe, but when would be a good one?\u201d\n\u201cNever?\u201d she suggests, laughing with some desperation, and Zuko looks at her sympathetically but doesn\u2019t comment on it. She bites her lip. \u201cI was trying to be honest with him,\u201d she admits shamefully, \u201cbut I think I went too far in the opposite direction. I can\u2019t seem to get it  right with Aang. I never have.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d he muses, rubbing the back of his neck again, and she wonders what he\u2019s thinking. Probably what Uncle Iroh would say right now, but she doesn\u2019t want Uncle Iroh\u2019s advice, she wants Zuko\u2019s understanding. But what he says instead of any adage or teaching is, \u201cYou got it right with yourself, that\u2019s the most important part.\u201d He takes a deep breath and looks at her with a wry twist to his lips. \u201cTrust me, once you get yourself where you\u2019re supposed to be, everything else falls into place a lot easier. Aang will see that, sooner or later, he\u2019ll realize that you\u2019re better off this way, you both are. That process, though, it\u2019s\u2026 not something you can have a part in. He\u2019s got to figure it out on his own, and you\u2019ve got to walk away and leave him to it.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy,\u201d she says softly.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he sighs, glancing down the table to where Mai is sitting with the Kyoshi Warriors, \u201cit\u2019s not. And I don\u2019t know anything that makes it easier. It\u2019s hard to walk away from someone you love but just can\u2019t be with, when it  should  work on paper, but it just  doesn\u2019t and you can barely even put your finger on why. It\u2019s better in the long run, but\u2026 it really hurts in the now.\u201d\nA silence falls as the servants make a pass around the table, picking up plates, and Katara hands hers over even though she\u2019s barely touched it, making a half-hearted comment about filling up on the soup. When they\u2019ve gone, she looks back to Zuko, struggling to find the words in a way she\u2019s unused to being.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she says, feeling lame that that\u2019s all she can come up with, but he smiles at her instead.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d he replies, shrugging like this emotional interlude really wasn\u2019t difficult for him, even though Katara knows that\u2019s not true, that Zuko struggles with this sort of thing: he\u2019s a great person and has many great qualities, but he\u2019s not much of a speaker. \u201cI mean, we\u2019re friends, right?\u201d he adds, although a bit delicately.\n\u201cRight,\u201d she agrees, and wonders why it doesn\u2019t  feel right.\n.\nAt breakfast the next morning, they all (including Aang, although he sits by Toph and doesn\u2019t look at her) all congregate together, and drink a couple of pots of strong black tea, none of them appearing to have slept very well, Katara included.\n\u201cSo, how are we tackling this?\u201d Sokka asks, leaning in. \u201cThe colonies are pretty much everyone\u2019s business at this point, after all.\u201d\n\u201cThe best we\u2019ve been able to come up with,\u201d Katara replies, gesturing to herself and Zuko, \u201cis a sort of public works program in the Fire Nation, to hopefully entice the colonists to return home. I don\u2019t know if the Earth Kingdom will accept that as a total solution, though.\"\n\u201cIt\u2019s not one,\u201d Aang interjects, but he doesn\u2019t sound hostile. \u201cIt will  help, but it\u2019s not the whole solution. We need to come at this from another angle.\u201d\n\u201cWhat have you been thinking?\u201d she asks, and he looks up at the group, but not at her.\n\u201cI was thinking about establishing a new nation,\u201d he says. \u201cUnder its own governance, not subject to any nation\u2019s rule.\u201d\n\u201cBut will the Earth Kingdom give up their land for that?\u201d Zuko asks, and Aang takes a deep breath, glancing at Toph, who gives him an encouraging gesture.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have to,\u201d Aang replies. \u201cThe Air Nomads are gone, and the temples are just gathering dust. I\u2026 well, Toph and I were thinking about making a trade with them, for the land around the Northern and Eastern Air Temples in exchange for at least some of the land that the colonists are occupying, and we could build a major city there. She said\u2026 well, I\u2019ll let her tell you.\u201d\n\u201cI ran it by my dad, actually,\u201d Toph admits, wincing. \u201cI figure, there\u2019s no one more  quintessentially Earth Kingdom than Lao Bei Fong, so he\u2019d be able to tell me if they\u2019d totally hate everything about it, but he thought about it for a long time and said it might actually be a feasible idea. So I think we\u2019ve got a chance of selling it to them.\u201d\n\u201cThat would actually work as an answer for our problem, too,\u201d Katara says, glancing at Zuko. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to build a new city-state, we\u2019ll need buildings, homes and shops and, well, a city. That would be an effective public works project, and if the Earth Kingdom was willing to help pay for it\u2026 would they be willing to help pay for it?\u201d\n\u201cUnlikely,\u201d Suki offers. \u201cAs far as they\u2019re concerned, they\u2019d be completely in the right to eradicate the colonies altogether. I doubt they\u2019d help pay for it.\u201d\n\u201cLeave that up to me, then,\u201d Katara says, eyes narrowing. \u201cI\u2019ll see if I can convince them. But I think it\u2019s a really good idea, Aang.\u201d\n\u201cThanks,\u201d he replies, but still doesn\u2019t even look at her.\n.\n\u201cYou expect us to simply give up our land, so that the invaders can have it?\u201d Lady Jiayi asks, eyes ablaze, and Aang takes a deep breath.\n\u201cIn exchange for half of the territory traditionally belonging to the Air Nomads,\u201d he replies, showing an impressive degree of patience, even for him. \u201cIt\u2019s been terraced in many places, and there are many orchards and rare fruits. Overall, the land you receive in this deal is more than you cede.\u201d\n\u201cAll so that you can build a new, happy little nation of colonial  monsters?\u201d she counters, blinking rapidly in false interest.\n\u201cAll so that we can take this problem  out of your hands,\u201d Zuko cuts in. \u201cThe colonists are, ultimately,  my problem. The Avatar has gone to great lengths to come up with a solution that benefits the greatest number of people with the lowest amount of sacrifice \u2013\u201d\n\u201cBecause  your people eradicated the Air Nomads!\u201d\n\u201cWith all due respect, Lady Jiayi,\u201d Toph snaps loudly, \u201c get over it. Your pride will be the death of thousands and thousands of people if you don\u2019t \u2013\u201d\n\u201cOur  pride is all that those firebending dogs didn\u2019t take from us!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s wrong,\u201d Katara says quietly, but it lands on the table like a thousand-ton boulder, and Jiayi has the self-awareness to look a bit ashamed. \u201cThe Southern Water Tribe could say that our pride was all that the Fire Nation didn\u2019t take from us, but  not the Earth Kingdom. Your cities are intact, your people thrive, whereas I am the last native waterbender of the Southern Water Tribe,\u201d she adds deliberately, voice wavering slightly with rage as her hands clench into fists under the table. \u201cBut none of the people responsible for that are here today. None of them still hold power, none of them are on Fire Lord Zuko\u2019s council of ministers. It\u2019s in the past. We must deal with the future.\u201d\nA ringing silence falls.\nLady Qiaolian of Ba Sing Se coughs lightly. \u201cKing Kuei,\u201d she says, looking to the King seated beside her, although he looks like he really wishes she wouldn\u2019t, \u201cthis is up to you. Will you agree to the Avatar\u2019s deal?\u201d\nKuei looks from Qiaolian to Aang to Katara to Zuko, and then back. \u201cIf you think it is a good idea, then I have no objection. The people of those colonies, obviously they will have the opportunity to emigrate or return to the Fire Nation, right?\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Aang replies. \u201cNo one is going to be forced to live somewhere they don\u2019t want to be.\u201d\n\u201cHow will you pay for it?\u201d Jiayi interjects, apparently willing to take this fight to the grave. \u201cIf you believe that Omashu will put forth the funding \u2013\u201d\n\u201cActually, I believe King Bumi would be quite supportive of the idea,\u201d Aang counters sharply, and Katara can see the  yes but he\u2019s a very old man forming on Jiayi\u2019s lips, but she must see the look on Aang\u2019s face, and decides not to press it.\n\u201cNot that I disagree with the Avatar,\u201d Lady Qiaolian says, subtly inching her chair away from Jiayi\u2019s, \u201cbut I do have to wonder at how he plans to fund this operation. Do you really feel it morally justifiable, to have us pay for your colonies, Fire Lord Zuko?\u201d\n\u201cI would have us both pay,\u201d he replies, although he glances at Katara when he says it. \u201cMany of those people consider themselves practically of the Earth Kingdom \u2013\u201d he starts, but it\u2019s the wrong thing to say.\n\u201cThey are  invaders, Fire Lord,\u201d Jiayi snaps. \u201cThey are  not  our people. They are  yours, and  your  problem alone.\u201d\n\u201cAs the Lady Bei Fong said earlier,\u201d Katara cuts in, \u201cget over it. The Fire Nation has its own concerns to deal with, it cannot fully fund this project on its own. Everyone stands the opportunity to benefit from this deal.\u201d\n\u201cYou expect us to just let this go?\u201d Jiayi snarls, and Katara gives her a look of pure, icy steel.\n\u201cWhy not? I did,\u201d she says sharply. \u201cAang did. Sokka did. Toph did. Or do you mean to tell me,\u201d she goes on, with false fascination, \u201cthat a group of  teenagers is capable of greater cultural empathy and forgiveness than grown adults with decades of experience who purport to speak for thousands of people?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 different,\u201d Jiayi replies, although she seems to know she\u2019s reaching.\n\u201cPlease, enlighten me as to how,\u201d Katara counters.\nOut of the corner of her eye, she sees Ministers Lian and Xu exchange looks of what might just be amusement.\nJiayi clearly knows that she has no ground to stand on in this argument, at least not with Katara, but she\u2019s also too stubborn to let it drop without a fight.\n\u201cThe Fire Lord is a personal friend of yours,\u201d she lands on, and Katara raises an eyebrow.\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t when we first met,\u201d she says simply. \u201cBut I\u2019m not here on behalf of the Fire Lord. He can speak for himself. I\u2019m here on behalf of the people who otherwise have no voice. You can ask Minister Xu about my feelings on this topic,\u201d she adds, and he pinches the bridge of his nose in irritation, but she also notices that it\u2019s hiding a small smile. \u201cThis is a solution which will benefit us all, as well as create a large number of jobs as the city requires building and maintenance. Jobs which are desperately needed. The Fire Lord has said he will offer half of the required funds, all we ask is that you meet us there.\u201d\n\u201cAnd how much would that  be?\u201d Qiaolian asks, striking for an artery and, unfortunately, drawing blood: none of them actually did that research. Katara glances at Minister Lian \u2013 a businesswoman with long years of experience in managing construction, albeit mostly on weapons of war in the past and now on technology \u2013 for help.\nLian rises magnificently to the occasion.\n\u201cIn terms of manpower,\u201d Lian starts, writing a few figures down on the paper in front of her, \u201cto build the bare bones of a city \u2013 a residential area, a market, and an administrative district \u2013 we would require a few hundred civilians, or half that if earthbenders were involved. In terms of gold\u2026\u201d she pauses, doing a few figures on the paper. \u201cPerhaps 62,000 pounds, all told. That covers the cost of material as well as wages for workers. Beyond that, the city  should be able to fund itself.\u201d\n\u201cSo you want us to supply you with 31,000 pounds of gold?\u201d Qiaolian asks, raising an eyebrow, and Lian looks from her to Zuko.\n\u201cIf the Fire Lord is willing to supply his half, I see no reason why the Earth Kingdom could not do the same.\u201d\nZuko, Katara notes, looks a bit alarmed at that figure.\n\u201cI would hesitate to set the number at that,\u201d Xu interjects, glancing down at Lian\u2019s notes. \u201c62,000 may cover the cost if nothing goes wrong, but we must consider that things may not go according to plan. I would set the beginning cost at 70,000, myself.\u201d\n\u201cYes, well, you\u2019re a pessimist,\u201d Lian mutters, and Xu raises an eyebrow, but doesn\u2019t comment.\n\u201c35,000, then,\u201d Qiaolian says, crossing her arms. \u201cThat\u2019s 35,000 pounds of gold  out  of the pockets of  our  people and  into the pockets of a new nation, with no guarantee of payoff.\"\n\u201cBut look at what you stand to gain,\u201d Sokka counters. \u201cA new nation means new trade, new cultural developments, new technology. For everybody. We all stand to benefit.\u201d\n\u201cI do not believe you know just  how  much 35,000 pounds of gold  truly is,\u201d Qiaolian deadpans, but Kuei steps in.\n\u201cI will fund it,\u201d he says quietly, and everyone looks at him. \u201cI have at least most of that in my own personal coffers,\u201d he goes on. \u201cIf Omashu and Gaoling and Kyoshi are willing to supply, perhaps, a thousand pounds apiece, I can cover the rest without inconveniencing the people in any way.\u201d\nAnother hard silence falls, and Qiaolian bites her lip. \u201cBa Sing Se \u2013 independent of the King \u2013 should also be included,\u201d she says, apparently somewhat ashamed by her king\u2019s generosity. \u201cIn fact, I would say that we could spare two thousand.\u201d\n\u201cA thousand pounds is a lot easier to come up with,\u201d Suki muses. \u201cBut I\u2019ll have to talk to the Elders at Kyoshi before I can say for sure.\u201d\n\u201cAs to that,\u201d Xu cuts in, steepling his fingers and peering at Zuko. \u201cHow do we intend to come up with 35,000 pounds of gold for this?\u201d\nZuko gives him a blank look. \u201cMy own coffers,\u201d he replies, like it\u2019s obvious. \u201cWe have a lot of gold, passed down through generations of royalty, and all it\u2019s doing is sitting around in the vaults. I\u2019m  sure we can make 35,000 pounds out of that.\u201d\nKatara notes the  passed down through generations of royalty, and she hopes that it\u2019s the truth \u2013 the idea of using gold stolen from other cultures to fund this sits wrong with her, and she knows it sits wrong with everyone else, too.\n\u201cWe will perform an inventory upon our return to the Fire Nation,\u201d Lian adds helpfully.\nJiayi looks very much like she wants to disagree, but now that she\u2019s been thoroughly outnumbered \u2013 and now that Kuei has proven his own intent to side with this \u2013 she simply purses her lips.\n\u201cI will discuss this with King Bumi,\u201d she says finally, begrudgingly, and Katara knows they\u2019ve won.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Aang replies, smiling, and for all the world, it looks completely genuine. \u201cI hope to discuss this with you further, when we begin moving forward with construction.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s settled, then,\u201d Kuei says, with a tremulous smile. \u201cWe will take the land surrounding the Northern and Eastern Air Temples, and contribute half of the funds to building a new nation for the colonies to inhabit.\u201d\n\u201cEveryone wins,\u201d Sokka says, sighing in relief, but Katara thinks \u2013 everyone except the Air Nomads.\nBut they lost a hundred years ago, and if it bothers Aang, he won\u2019t show it to these people; or, for that matter, her, not anymore.\nThis is what Zuko was talking about last night; although she wants more than anything to reach out and ask him if he\u2019s  really okay with this, she can\u2019t. He said that he discussed it with Toph, and at any rate, Katara has done nothing but hurt him for two years running. He won\u2019t want to talk to her anyway.\n You\u2019ve got to walk away and leave him to it.\nOh well, she thinks. Oh  well. \nHer own words rise up in her mind:  it\u2019s in the past. We must deal with the future.\nShe smiles at Zuko, and he smiles back.\nact four: this is as good a place to fall as any (we will build our altar here)\n.\nPerhaps not to be outdone by the Fire Nation, Kuei hosts his own party after the final meetings have adjourned, with musicians and an overabundance of food and that dry wine that Katara liked so much and decides to imbibe perhaps entirely too much of.\nAang attends the party, but avoids her in a way that's so painfully obvious that it cuts her \u2013 at this point less because he's avoiding her, than because he doesn't even try to hide it.\n\u201cIt'll be fine,\u201d Suki says with a shrug, and Katara sighs.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d she replies. \u201cIt'll  be fine.\u201d\n It's just not fine now, she wants to say, but lets it go. Now is a time for celebration, for talking about all the good things they have accomplished, for planning ahead and getting a jump-start on the future. What's done is done. All she can do is work with what hasn't happened yet.\nSuki looks at her with a sympathetic quirk to her lips. \u201cI know how much this sucks,\u201d she says quietly, \u201cbut\u2026 I want you to know, I'm  really impressed with you.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she asks, and Suki smiles.\n\u201cUntil Sokka told me this morning, I had no  idea  Aang tried to get back together with you,\u201d she explains. \u201cI would never have guessed that you were hurting, or struggling. You had a job to do and you did it, and you were even better than you had to be. It's really impressive. I'm really,  really proud of you.\u201d\nShe's taken aback by Suki's frank praise, and she knows it's clear on her face. \u201cUm\u2026 thank you. I just\u2026 People are depending on me, I couldn't let them down.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but it's harder than it looks, I know,\u201d Suki replies, draining her glass. \u201cI had to be the leader of the Kyoshi Warriors after me and Sokka broke up the first time, it was rough. I didn't do it as well as you did. You nailed it, Katara. You absolutely  nailed this council, and I think it's amazing that you did it while you were reeling.\u201d\nKatara hides her emotion behind a deep drink of wine. Hearing it actually said to her in so many words is\u2026 overwhelming, so she tries to laugh it off a bit. \"Well\u2026 I know you had good money on me dousing everyone again, so I doubt you're one-hundred-percent happy with me right now.\u201d\nSuki pauses, perhaps sensing that Katara doesn't really know how to respond, and then laughs. \u201cThat is true. I lost five gold pieces to Sokka because of that, so, you know. Thanks,  Katara.\u201d\nShe snickers into her glass. \u201cI'll pay you back.\u201d\n\u201cYou'd better.\u201d\nBoth of their glasses are empty now, so she offers to get the both of them another drink, but Suki shrugs it off, insisting on joining her. It feels\u2026 strange, she thinks, in some small way, to know that Suki \u2013 the proud warrior, the impossibly unshakeable woman, the person who survived being Azula's favorite prisoner at the Boiling Rock when she was sixteen \u2013 is proud of her. It's sort of how she feels when she sees her with Sokka: a bit bewildered at how much Suki softens when she's around someone she loves. It's easy to forget how compassionate the other woman is, when she covers her face with the heavy warpaint and fights with such a deep well of conviction that it's impossible to imagine her ever giving up.\nBut Suki is a person, a woman only a little older than Katara, who has been through awful things and come up out of each and every one of them swinging, who has a heart that's big enough for the whole world.\nSuki wouldn't be upset with Sokka's awful pendant; she'd wear it with pride, because she'd know it was made with love, by someone who loved her so much that he tried to do something he knew he wasn't any good at just to show her how much he cared. Katara makes a mental note to point this out to him.\nThey're at the drinks table, waiting on a new bottle to be opened, when the conversation drifts in from the nearby balcony, and they both freeze.\n\u201c\u2013 all due respect,\" Mai is saying, \"I don't plan to return anytime soon.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Zuko replies, \u201cyou're welcome to, whenever you want. You're not exiled, I mean.\u201d\n\u201cI appreciate that,\u201d Mai says, and Katara can practically hear her raising an eyebrow. \u201cI know more than a few people were telling you to do it.\u201d\n\"They're not the Fire Lord,  I  am.\"\n\u201cNo one does it alone, Zuko, not even you.\u201d There's a pause, and she thinks they really ought to go now that their glasses have been refilled, but she meets Suki's eyes, and neither of them move a muscle. \u201cDon't shut her out like you did me.\u201d\n\u201cIt's not \u2013 it's not like that,\u201d Zuko stammers, and even to Katara \u2013 who knows for a  fact that it's not like that \u2013 it doesn't sound convincing. \u201cI mean \u2013\u201d\n\u201cStop,\u201d Mai snaps. \u201cYou\u2019re a terrible liar. Everyone can see it, and they won't  shut up  about it. I'm not upset, but I  do really wish they had something more interesting to talk about.\u201d\nZuko groans. \u201cMai\u2026\u201d he starts, and then sighs. \u201cI'm sorry.\u201d\n\u201cFor what?\u201d she counters. \u201cI told you, I'm not upset. I don't want to go back to the Fire Nation, and what we had\u2026\u201d she sighs, \u201cit was good while it lasted, but it's long gone now.\u201d\n\u201cThat's true,\u201d he replies, but it sounds a bit forced, or maybe just awkward.\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d Mai starts, and then lets out a long sigh. \u201cFor everything we had that was good, I thank you,\u201d she says in a low voice, almost as though the words are rehearsed. \u201cAnd for all we had that was bad, I apologize. It's over now, and it's long past time for us to move on.\u201d\n\u201cYou're right,\u201d Zuko says slowly. \u201cAnd I apologize, too. I\u2026 wasn't a very good boyfriend to you.\u201d\n\u201cYou were exactly as good a boyfriend to me as I was a girlfriend to you,\u201d Mai replies evenly, and then takes a deep breath. \u201cYou meet people, Zuko,\u201d she says in a strange voice, as though speaking something aloud she's never really thought about before. \u201cYou rise as high as they expect you to. I didn't ask much of you. I didn't believe you'd give it to me if I did, and that was wrong. I was wrong not to have faith in you. But she has faith, just like your uncle does. They believe in you, and it'll make you a better person and a better ruler in the long run, because you'll never let them down again.\u201d\nSuki reaches out and touches her shoulder, and she jumps, glancing aside to catch the other girl's gaze.  We should go, she mouths, and Katara nods.\nThe whole walk away, Suki is watching her out of the corner of her eye, perhaps waiting for her to confirm or deny anything going on between her and Zuko, but Katara wouldn't even know how to answer that question if she was asked. Is there something between them? He was non-committal, but was that because he wasn't interested, or because he was talking to his ex-girlfriend?\nIs this what she wants? To be Fire Lady, the way Mai clearly thinks she will be, and rule by Zuko's side?\nIt has a certain appeal, she can't deny it \u2013 to be the Fire Lady, the second-most powerful person in the nation and, officially, one of the most powerful people in the world. It's a position traditionally associated with social action; Fire Ladies of the past have usually invested in social welfare, in hospitals and schools and safety nets for the poor \u2013 it's actually generally been considered the Fire Lady's job to care for such things, while the Fire Lord concerns himself with foreign policy and defense and the economy.\nIn a successful reign, the Fire Lady is the one who cares about the small-scale, while the Fire Lord is the one who cares about the large. When they work together to bring everyone up, they have, historically, found great success. The position is associated with great influence over social and domestic affairs.\nBut it's not the political part that really occupies her mind.\nShe's thinking distantly of all that she could do as Fire Lady, but she's thinking much more personally and clearly about all the times she's sat with Zuko on the roof and talked about things \u2013 sometimes important things and sometimes about pictures in the stars. She's thinking about having tea with him and assuring him that they would work together to make things right. She's thinking about how they laughed about Boscoe and how he understood her conflicted feelings about Aang.\nShe's thinking about a  partnership, being seen as an equal rather than a perfect goddess who could do no wrong.\nIt's even more appealing than the power to affect great change.\nBut there's something else lurking under the surface of her mind, something that's slowly wrapping its vines around her heart and  squeezing, and she can't put a word to the emotion; it's not jealousy, not really, but it's something like it, something that keeps going over the conversation she's overheard and seething inward. It's upsetting, both at herself and at Mai's calm words, and she can't identify it clearly.\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d Suki asks, and Katara jumps, then gives her a brittle smile.\n\u201cI'm fine,\u201d she lies. \u201cI was a little surprised to hear\u2026 do you think me and Zuko are an item?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Suki replies in a measured voice, watching her carefully. \u201cThe rumor mill has been going, that's true, but I always figured you would have told me, or at least Sokka.\u201d\n\u201cI would have,\u201d she says, almost automatically.\n\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d Suki asks her again, concerned. \u201cDon't worry about what people are saying.\u201d\n\u201cI'm just \u2013\u201d she starts, but doesn't know how to articulate her emotions, so she changes tack to something else, which is only a lie in the sense that it's only just now crossing her mind for the first time: \u201cI don't want Aang to think I turned him down to pursue Zuko. That would hurt him a lot.\u201d\nSuki hesitates, then reaches out to turn Katara so that they're facing each other. \u201cIs that why you've stayed single since you left him?\u201d she asks seriously. \u201cBecause you don't have to wait until he's over you to move on. You don't owe it to him to stay single until it won't hurt him to see you with someone else, even if that someone is a friend of his.\u201d\nKatara takes a deep gulp of wine to hide, again, the startling feeling of transparency, and settles on jokingly-aloof as a solid way to respond. \u201cFor your information,\u201d she says archly, \u201cI've stayed single because I've either been in the Water Tribe with my brother or in the Fire Nation with a bunch of people three times my age. I'm too busy for romance, anyway.\u201d\nThere's a beat, where Suki seems to decide not to press her for more details. \u201cFair enough,\u201d she sighs, holding up a hand in apology. \u201cI just don't want you putting your life on hold because you\u2019re afraid to hurt Aang. You deserve better than that.\u201d\nShe takes a deep breath and gives Suki a brittle smile. \u201cI'm not, I promise,\u201d she says, and wonders distantly if it's a lie.\n.\nHer mood doesn't improve as the party progresses, and she finds herself unconsciously avoiding the people who would make her feel better. Uncle Iroh is organizing the musicians into playing some sort of upbeat dance piece, while Zuko stands beside him with his head in his hand and Toph appears to be trying to convince one of them to teach her to play the drum \u2013 it's like a little pocket of people who would make her happy, but she doesn't want to be cheered up right now.\nThe only person she'd really like to talk to right now is Sokka, but for all that she's scanned the room, she hasn't seen him in a while, and wonders if maybe he left early. Come to think of it, Suki seems to have melted out of the party as well, which probably explains it.\nShe's just about to call it a night so she can go sleep off her bad mood, when Mai's voice surprises her for the second time tonight.\n\u201cYou did good,\u201d she says, and Katara jumps.\n\u201cPardon?\u201d she replies, a bit dumbly.\n\u201cI said, you did good,\u201d Mai repeats, evidently thinking that Katara didn't hear her, rather than Katara doesn't know why she's being complimented. \u201cAt the Council. If I didn't know you were a wreck at the start of this, I would never have suspected it.\u201d\nShe blinks. It's a kind thing to say, and it's meant as a compliment, and not even a backhanded or half-hearted kind of one, either, but her mind sticks on  you were a wreck,\u00a0and she bites her tongue.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she says instead, with a thin smile, but Mai doesn't seem to be paying very close attention. In fact, she looks agitated, as though she's steeling herself up to say something she doesn't want to say. \u201cSleeping on it helped.\u201d\n\u201cI'm sure,\u201d Mai replies, with a fleeting, insincere smile. \u201cLook,\u201d she starts, taking a deep breath and glancing away, \u201ctake care of Zuko, all right?\u201d\nKatara flinches in spite of herself. \u201cIt's not\u2026 I know people are gossipping, but \u2013\u201d\n\u201cI don't really care about your denial,\u201d Mai cuts her off, and Katara finishes her wine with alacrity. \u201cI just care that he's okay. He'll work himself to death if you don't watch out. He has to have  someone there to give him a break sometimes.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Katara stammers, distantly wishing that she hadn't drank so much. \u201cI mean, he'll have both me and Toph there, we'll make sure he doesn't get overwhelmed.\u201d\nMai gives her a deadpan look that nevertheless laughs at her incredulously, and she tilts her chin up against both it and that dark, clawing emotion that threatens to choke the air out of her lungs. It's so much stronger now; she'd almost forgotten about it until Mai decided to be nice for once. She still can't identify it, what exactly it is about Mai right now that is so upsetting to her, why she wants to grab her by the shoulders and scream \u2013 something, something at her, but she doesn't know what.\nMai lets it go first.\n\u201cGood,\u201d she says evenly. \u201cHe should be happy.\u201d\nAnd then it hits her, what it is she wants to scream \u2013 why do you get to be at peace when I can't be?\nIt's  envy, the emotion sucking at her like a whirlpool; envy, raw and running deep, she  envies Mai for being at peace with her past relationship, while Katara's won't stop haunting her. Mai can have a normal conversation with her ex-boyfriend \u2013 someone she loved, and sacrificed for, and lived with, and believed she would spend the rest of her life with \u2013 without either of them leaving in tears or lashing out, and, in fact, both walk away from it feeling better and lighter and calmer.\nEveryone says that peace will come with time, but she doesn't want it  in time, she wants it  now.\nShe wants it three days ago.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Katara says, swallowing the emotion hard, and if Mai can tell that she's a tangle of dark emotion right now, she doesn't give any indication of it, merely giving her a small smile with more sincerity than before, and that smile \u2013 meant in kindness \u2013 fills her with the need to leave the room, now. \u201cHe really should. If you'll excuse me,\u201d she adds, and gives the other woman a slight bow, which Mai returns, before she flees the party entirely.\n.\nIt\u2019s Ty Lee who finds her in Kuei\u2019s private garden, and the all-too-casual way she slinks in makes Katara think that someone \u2013 probably Suki \u2013 told her that she needed a friend right now.\n\u201cHi,\u201d Katara says tightly, \u201csorry I haven\u2019t had much time to talk.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Ty Lee replies, waving it off with a smile, \u201ceverybody\u2019s been super-busy.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a stretched-thin pause, and Katara sighs. \u201cDid someone tell you to come looking for me?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d she says, shaking her head. \u201cI saw you leave the party, you seemed kind of upset. Mai told me about Aang. Did he try to talk to you again at the party?\u201d\nShe bites her lip, considers lying \u2013 but Ty Lee would probably know, and, worse,  not say anything about it. They would just both  know that she lied to a friend who left a party to make sure she was okay, and Katara isn\u2019t sure she can be that kind of person.\n\u201cNo,\u201d she answers, sighing. \u201cHe\u2019s pretending not to know me at all. I\u2026 overheard Zuko and Mai talking, and\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou know they\u2019re not getting back together, right?\u201d Ty Lee says fervently, and Katara shakes her head.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not \u2013 I mean, yes, I know, and I wouldn\u2019t be upset even if they were,\u201d she replies woodenly, knowing deep down that that part is absolutely a lie, but at least it\u2019s the sort of lie she won\u2019t be judged on. Ty Lee keeps her expression very carefully still. \u201cIt just made me think\u2026 I wish I had their peace. I wish Aang and I had that peace. I\u2026 I don\u2019t usually envy other people, it kind of hit me like a ton of bricks.\u201d\nSilence falls, and Ty Lee bites her lip.\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t happen overnight,\u201d she says softly, after a moment. \u201cTrust me, however nasty things got between you and Aang, it was nastier between Zuko and Mai. She said and did a  lot of things she regrets, and I know she feels like she\u2019ll be apologizing for how she acted to him for a long time, no matter what he may say about forgiveness. It\u2019s taken them both a long time to get here.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Katara replies, running a hand through her hair. \u201cAnd I know, it just takes time. I know it\u2019s not fair to expect Aang to \u2013 to wave his hand and be over it. I know.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Ty Lee says, nodding sympathetically. \u201cJust because you know a feeling is wrong doesn\u2019t mean you stop feeling it.\u201d Katara buries her head in her hands, half in frustration and half in a sort of raw, seething resentment that\u2019s directed inward, at herself for feeling such stupid things, and Ty Lee rubs her back. \u201cLook at it this way, you\u2019re hurting because you care, and your caring is your biggest strength. If you were the kind of person who was okay with hurting Aang, you wouldn\u2019t be the kind of person who inspires worldwide change.\u201d\nKatara\u2019s hands tighten in her hair.\n\u201cDon\u2019t wish for not caring, is what I mean,\u201d Ty Lee adds, striking at something Katara hadn\u2019t even thought of in so many words.\n\u201cIt seems like it would be easier,\u201d she mutters, and Ty Lee tilts her head.\n\u201cFor who?\u201d\nKatara opens her mouth to say me, obviously, but then closes it again: if she didn\u2019t care, didn\u2019t hurt for others, if she could just magically \u2013 right now \u2013 make her compassion leave her, then she would be leaving the Fire Nation and the world to hang. Chunhua would never get her school, because no one would argue for it; the poor people in the city would never have a voice in the council to speak for their concerns, because no one would care to listen; the Water Tribe\u2019s place in the world would diminish, because no one would be fighting to include them.\nAnd maybe it would all work out eventually\u2026 but, after all, what didn\u2019t,  eventually, work out for some people?\nAccording to the writings of the Fire Sage Lao Shen, nations weren\u2019t built on the force of ideas or might or power, they were built on the force of  personality. They were built, not because they were necessary or pragmatic or strategic, but because one person stood up and said  I will build this, join me, and people joined them. That was what made the difference between a decent ruler and a great ruler: the ability to say  follow me  and be followed.\nAnd that ability  required  you to care. No leader could be great without compassion, no great things could happen without someone who  cared pushing them forward.\nKatara looks up at Ty Lee, a different sort of unidentifiable emotion rising in her chest: a strange, heavy calm, like the sort that falls after the storm has swept the land clean.\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she says slowly. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be easier for anybody.\u201d\nTy Lee gives her a wry smile. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna be okay, and so will Aang. And you\u2019re gonna do it without blowing each other to bits and regretting everything you\u2019ve done. And then you're gonna go make the world a better place for everyone. If you won\u2019t trust yourself, trust me.\u201d\nKatara returns the smile, albeit with some water, and gives her a tight hug.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she says quietly, and Ty Lee squeezes her back.\n\u201cYou're not alone, you know,\u201d she replies. \u201cWe're all rooting for you.\u201d\nShe closes her eyes and breathes deep. \u201cI know,\" she says. \"I know.\u201d\n.\nThey're all ridiculously hung-over on the trip back to the Fire Nation in the morning. Katara is lucky \u2013 being a waterbender who grew up half in kayaks, she's never in her life gotten seasick, even when the hangover is threatening to evacuate her brain from her skull \u2013 and Zuko spent three years on a ship when he was younger, so he has ironclad sea legs, but Toph is not so lucky.\n\u201cWhy didn't you stop me from drinking all that wine?\u201d Toph moans, leaning heavily on the railing, and Katara sighs.\n\u201cI didn't see you for half the night,\u201d she replies, gingerly holding the younger girl's hair back as she starts dry-heaving again. \u201cAnd I was too busy drinking myself into oblivion, too, anyway.\u201d\n\u201cI'm never touching wine again.\u201d\n\u201cAt least not for a while,\u201d she agrees.\n\u201cLook on the bright side,\u201d Zuko says from Toph's other side, \u201cyou don't have to see your parents for a long time.\u201d\nToph simply groans, and Zuko pats her on the back sympathetically. Katara leans her forehead on the cold railing and takes a deep, steadying breath.\nIn spite of the hangover, she feels better today than she has since walking out onto that balcony to speak to Aang.\nIt will be okay, she thinks, even if it isn\u2019t right now. Just keep moving forward. The only way out is through.\n.\nThe first day back in the Fire Nation, they don't have any meetings \u2013 figuring that they would all need a day to recover from traveling, everyone had agreed not to schedule anything \u2013 but Katara has a few stops she intends to make.\nChunhua smiles at her when she walks into the teashop, and a few people wave. She's become a regular now, and has gotten into a few spirited conversations with Chunhua, her parents and young sister, and other regulars at times, about what the country needs, what the workers and the builders and the artisans need \u2013 although Katara has kept quiet about who she actually is, doubting that people would be quite so open to discussion if they knew that they were speaking with someone who had some measure of real power to act.\nKatara wants to be seen as one of them, a person first and a council member second \u2013 she wants to know what they say to each other, what they think and want, not what they think is pragmatic to ask for, or what they think is realistic to hope for.\nShe wants to know what they  want, not what they'll settle for.\n\u201cHow'd the vacation go?\u201d Chunhua asks, with a twinkle of amusement in her eyes at being in on something secret, bringing out a pot of tea for her. \u201cThis one's on me, I think you'll like it.\u201d\n\u201cI think it went pretty well,\u201d Katara replies, smiling. \u201cI feel like we got a lot done, it was\u2026 refreshing.\u201d\n\u201cThat's great!\" Chunhua says. \u201cIt's always good to get away for a while. How was the city?\u201d\nKatara laughs. \u201cI didn't see much of it, unfortunately. But I'm glad to be back here.\u201d\n\u201cI'm glad to see you back here, too.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d she says evenly, feeling energized. \u201cI have work to do.\u201d\n.\nThe first thing the Council decides is to make a separate, offshoot committee for working on the new city, a committee that will work with Aang and the Earth Kingdom as they move forward, and Katara thinks long and hard about it before deciding, with some internal defiance, to add her name to it. She was sort of expected to, unofficially, but her delicate history with Aang made her hesitate.\nBut the world is more important.\nToph is sort of taking the lead on it, and Katara suspects that she had more than a little to do with its inception in the first place \u2013 at any rate, as their resident Earth Kingdom expert, she\u2019s going to be doing a lot of heavy lifting in making arrangements with the stubborn people who never much wanted this to begin with and are likely to fight her every step of the way. She can\u2019t wait to see one of them try to argue Toph down, though; Toph has pure steel in her backbone, and she believes in this, probably more than any of the rest of them except maybe Aang, if Katara is being honest.\nKatara will help her, if she needs it, but Katara has work to do in the Fire Nation, first.\nAs such, the next thing she proposes is a hospital.\n\u201cWe have \u201cHealer\u2019s Row\u201d off the marketplace, but it's diffuse and fragmented,\u201d she explains, \u201cand their skills can only go so far. I know there are a few barber-surgeons, if we brought a couple of them together with the herbalists and bonesetters and such, we could have a central place where people could go when they need medical help. Plus, building a hospital would provide jobs, at least for a while.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll need to consider the cost,\u201d Xu, of course, says, and Katara nods.\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she replies. \u201cI just wanted to put the proposal out there, so we can begin moving forward on it.\u201d\n\u201cMinister Lian,\u201d Zuko says, nodding at the older woman, who returns the nod and shoots Katara a smile, \u201ccan help you draw up a full proposal, and we can discuss it at length in next week\u2019s meeting.\u201d\n\u201cI would be glad to, Fire Lord Zuko,\u201d Lian says, with a small bow.\n\u201cAnd the secondary committee will meet in three days to begin moving forward on the issue of the colonies and Avatar Aang\u2019s city,\u201d Zuko says to the assembly. \u201cI want a tentative plan of action on my desk that morning, along with a preliminary breakdown of the cost and what we will need to come up with to break ground. Toph, you\u2019re in contact with Aang and King Kuei, right?\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d she replies, fingers tapping on the desk nervously. \u201cAang is staying in Ba Sing Se for the next few weeks, at least, to work out details on that end. I\u2019ll be the go-between for you. Kuei said he would come up with their own estimate for how much we\u2019ll need and send it to me once they\u2019ve got something worked out, so we can compare ours to theirs.\u201d\n\u201cGood, that\u2019s a good start. Does anyone have anything else to ask, or propose?\u201d\nA general murmur of agreement and settling-up passes over the table, and Zuko nods.\n\u201cAll right, let\u2019s get to work,\u201d he says firmly, and they all stand to mosey out of the room.\nToph sighs heavily and runs a hand over her face, and Katara glances at her.\n\u201cThe work never stops,\u201d she mutters, as an explanation. \u201cOne day of rest and then back to the grind.\u201d\nKatara smiles. \u201cThat\u2019s how it goes, I guess,\u201d she says wryly. \u201cThe world never stops moving, so neither can we.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Toph sighs. \u201cWhen did we get to be adults, with all this dumb responsibility?\u201d\n\u201cWhen we stepped up,\u201d she replies, patting Toph on the shoulder. \u201cHey, you could have stayed in Gaoling and had servants feed you grapes all day, you know.\u201d\nToph shudders. \u201cYeah, trust me, I\u2019ll take these meetings and boring reports any day of the week. They kept trying to wash my feet.\u201d\n\u201cIt gets easier,\u201d she says, and Toph shrugs.\n\u201cI guess. I can count on you to help me write out the first draft of my plan?\u201d she asks, and Katara nods.\n\u201cOf course. When do you want to discuss it?\u201d\n\u201cTomorrow?\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d she replies. \u201cI\u2019ve got some meetings in the morning, but we\u2019ll have tea in the afternoon and hash it out.\u201d\n\u201cSounds great,\u201d Toph says, and laughs a little, almost at herself. Katara tilts her head.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d\nToph pauses, then makes a face. \u201cI sound like my mom, making political meetings. I was always against authority, now I am one.\u201d\nKatara hesitates, then sits back down. \u201cThat\u2019s a good thing, Toph,\u201d she says seriously. \u201cYou can stand up for things you believe in, rein in people who try to control you, and help people. You have the power to change things for the better.  We  have the power to change things for the better.\u201d\n\u201cI just never really cared about all this stuff, you know?\u201d she replies. \u201cI just wanted to cheer Aang up, and now I\u2019m in charge of making a city out of nothing. I never asked for this. I just wanted to be left alone, myself.\u201d\n\u201cApathy has never accomplished anything,\u201d Katara says, in a measured tone, and Toph tilts her ear toward her. \u201cYou stepped in when you ran away from your parents to join us and teach Aang earthbending \u2013 have you ever regretted it?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d she answers immediately.\n\u201cOf course not. Nobody who ever stands up and acts for something they believe in  ever  ends up regretting it,\u201d she says, with feeling. \u201cEven if it\u2019s hard, and boring, and you have to deal with tedious little details like how many bricks you\u2019ll need to build a city and how much public restrooms will cost and who to bill for them \u2013 one day, you\u2019ll look back on all you\u2019ve done and all the  incredibly boring meetings you barely managed to stay awake in, and you\u2019ll know that you made something amazing happen.\u201d\nToph pauses, apparently mulling it over, and then smiles, punching her lightly in the arm. \u201cI\u2019m gonna make you sit through all these boring meetings with me, you know.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I know, and we\u2019ll complain about them later,\u201d she laughs. \u201cBut we\u2019ll get things done.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Toph replies, standing up. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna get it done.\u201d\n.\nKatara finds Zuko in the private garden late the following afternoon, sitting on a little stone bench, watching the turtleducks with a sort of blank expression.\nShe sits next to him, and he glances up at her, blinking rapidly in apparent surprise.\n\u201cYou were very engrossed with the turtleducks,\u201d she says, and immediately feels a bit stupid for it. He laughs, rubbing the back of his neck.\n\u201cI think one of them has a nest somewhere,\u201d he replies, pointing at a turtleduck that, to her, looks no different than any of the others, except maybe a little bigger. \u201cHe keeps going back and forth to those reeds on the other side of the pond, I think he's bringing food for his mate.\u201d\n\"You study turtleduck mating behavior?\" she asks, deliberately deadpan, and he gives her a look of mock-affront.\n\u201cI  like turtleducks,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you're gonna be like that, I won't let you see any of the babies.\u201d\nShe has to admit, that actually sounds unpleasant \u2013 they're pretty damn cute as adults, she can only imagine how adorable turtleduck chicks must be. \u201cOkay, okay,\u201d she sighs, holding her hands up in supplication and snickering. \u201cI apologize for pointing out how  huge  a  dork you are.\u201d\nZuko tries to hold onto the affronted look, but he can't hide his amusement. \u201cHey, now,\u201d he says anyway, but she just shoves him lightly in the shoulder.\n\u201cHow many do they usually have at a time?\u201d she asks, and he shrugs.\n\u201cI've only seen a couple of broods hatch before,\u201d he answers, wincing at her and rubbing the back of his neck again, which must be a nervous habit. \u201cMaybe nine or ten?\u201d\n\u201cAre they as  stupidly adorable as I think they will be?\u201d\n\u201cEven cuter.\u201d\n\u201cWhen will we see them?\u201d\n\u201cWhenever they're big enough to learn how to swim, their mother will bring them out into the pond,\u201d he replies. \u201cAll the turtleducks know me,\" he admits, a bit sheepishly, and she has to admit to herself that that is \u2013 although incredibly dorky \u2013 really, really sweet, \u201cso she probably won't get upset if I pick up one of her ducklings.\u201d He must feel her amusement, because he looks up at her, and then away. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cNothing,\u201d she replies airily. \u201cI think it's sweet. You're friends with the turtleducks.\u201d\n\u201cI know it's not the most\u2026 um, manly thing,\u201d he winces, coughing a bit and cringing, but Katara simply shrugs.\n\u201cI can't think of anything better in a guy,\u201d she says, leaning in a little, \u201cthan a nurturing personality. Women don't want a guy who will bail on them,\u201d she goes on cheerfully. \u201cThey want someone who stays and cares for small things, like turtleducks, and children.\u201d\nHe laughs a little, and it sounds kind of nervous.\n\u201cI read your proposal for the hospital,\u201d he says, apparently out of the blue, and she blinks.\n\u201cOh,\u201d she replies dumbly, but catches herself and shifts gears back into politics-mode. \u201cDo you think there's anything I've missed?\u201d\n\u201cXu is gonna say you're lowballing the cost,\u201d he says, shrugging, \u201cbut I think we could handle it if it goes over what you've planned for.\u201d\n\u201cXu is a pessimist,\u201d she scoffs. \u201cI worked that out with Lian, she thinks it's reasonable.\u201d\nHe holds up his hands. \u201cI didn't say I disagreed,\u201d he says lightly. \u201cLike I said, I think we can handle it if it goes over, so we can cover Xu's definite argument. My only concern\u2026\u201d he trails off, wincing, and then looks at her. \u201cDo you think a healing waterbender from the North will agree to come to the Fire Nation on a permanent basis?\u201d\nShe hesitates. \u201cHonestly?\u201d she replies, sighing. \u201cNot really. Not at first, at least. But\u2026,\u201d she goes on, biting her lip, \u201cI think I can do it, at least to get things started. I could go for a few hours a day, I have that time. And, as we grow, and things improve\u2026 well, I think there are some healers in the South who are getting pretty good, and they're young so they probably want to travel\u2026 I think we can make it work.\u201d\n\u201cThat's a lot of responsibility to take on,\u201d he says, in a deceptively neutral tone, and she tilts her head.\n\u201cWhat, you think I can't do it?\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d he cries, surprised. \u201cIt's not\u2026 I just don't want you to get overwhelmed. You're already doing a lot, I just... don't want you to get overwhelmed,\u201d he repeats, a bit lamely, and she wonders what he was going to say.\n\u201cLike I said, I don't have to be there all day, every day,\u201d she shrugs. \u201cThere are herbalists and healers in the Caldera already who can deal with the normal things, I'd just be there to handle things that are beyond their skills.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026 You're doing a lot for us,\u201d he says quietly, \u201cthat's all. You don't have to, you know.\u201d\nShe looks away. \u201cI don't do things halfway, Zuko,\u201d she replies deliberately. \u201cEither I'm here completely or I'm not here at all. I'm not going to stand here and not help to the fullest of my ability just because I don't have to.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d he says, rubbing the back of his neck again and glancing down. \u201cI guess I'm trying to say thank you. For everything you've done when you didn't have to do anything.\u201d\nShe looks back at him and tilts her head, before catching his hand and stopping him from that nervous tic. \u201cI came here to help, Zuko,\u201d she says softly. \u201cI'd be betraying you if I didn't do everything in my power.\u201d\nHe meets her eyes for a second, then looks away. \u201cI mean\u2026\u201d he starts, sounding nervous, \u201cI could never talk to anyone like this,\u201d he goes on, in a bit of a rush. \u201cMai always thought that\u2026 we couldn't talk about anything serious when we were alone, I think she thought\u2026 she was trying to get my mind off of things and help me relax, but\u2026 I don't stop being the Fire Lord when the sun sets. It's my  life, not my job. And\u2026 it's been really helpful, to me, that I can talk to you, and you're always willing to listen and respond.\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d she replies, because she's not really sure how else to respond. He seems agitated now.\n\u201cSo\u2026\u201d he starts, although it sounds slightly disappointed, \u201cum, thank you.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d she says slowly, and then glances away, to the turtleducks. \u201cThank  you. I feel like I\u2019m actually making a difference, making the world a better place. I feel like I\u2019m in a better place since you offered me the position, so. Thank you.\u201d She looks at him again and smiles, and he returns it, albeit tentatively.\n\u201cHow is Toph doing?\u201d\nKatara laughs a little. \u201cComplaining about the boring work, but I think she likes feeling involved, too, although she\u2019s too proud to admit it.\u201d\nZuko snickers. \u201cThat sounds like Toph. I will say this,\u201d he adds, leaning back on the bench and stretching his legs out, \u201cit  is nice to have someone I can trust who can take over a lot of the details on the new city, it\u2019s a weight off my shoulders.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to have someone else we know we can trust here,  period,\u201d she says, leaning back and almost \u2013 but not quite \u2013 against him. \u201cI think the ministers are fine, but it\u2019s nice to have a friend.\u201d\nHe glances at her. \u201cYeah,\u201d he replies in a strange voice. \u201cIt really is.\u201d\n.\nXu, predictably, complains about the cost of the hospital, but agrees that they\u2019ve worked out a reasonable proposal, and pledges to commit some funds to its building, so Katara figures it\u2019s as close to an unqualified win as she\u2019s likely to get, well, ever. The planning for the new city goes less smoothly, because now that they aren\u2019t there in person to argue over it, Kuei (or, more likely, his ministers) is being a little more reluctant with funding and preparing.\n\u201cWe agreed on a fifty-fifty  split!\u201d Toph yells, after Katara has read to her his latest, frustrating letter. \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault that the cost is higher than expected! He can\u2019t just say he agreed to pay however much money, he agreed to pay  half!\u201d\n\u201cWe can talk to Suki,\u201d Katara soothes. \u201cAnd you can talk to your parents. If Kuei isn\u2019t willing to pay any extra, or if he can\u2019t pay any extra, we can talk to other Earth Kingdom cities. This was always going to be the hard part. We can work this out.\u201d\nToph lets out a scream of frustration and punches a hole in the ground. \u201cPolitics are  stupid!\u201d she shouts, and Katara tries not to laugh, because she knows that Toph is truly upset over this stumbling block, since it throws a wrench into her delicate planning. But Toph is the quintessential earthbender \u2013 she never gives up, and she knows how to deal with stumbling blocks. Once she calms down, she\u2019ll realize that there are other ways to handle this setback, and that it\u2019ll be okay.\nIt\u2019s just that right now, she is not calm, and Katara is, unfortunately, the punching bag.\nBut she figures that she knows how to deal with an angry Toph, too, and better than pretty much anyone else here, so it\u2019s better her than them. Toph won\u2019t actually hurt her, at any rate. She\u2019ll yell and throw things and make a bunch of holes in the ground, but she won\u2019t do anything that will actually cause lasting damage.\n\u201cDeep breaths, Toph,\u201d Katara says. \u201cThese things happen. Two steps forward, one step back. We just have to keep moving forward.\u201d\nToph growls and throws herself to the ground sullenly. \u201cThose grapes and footbaths look really good right now,\u201d she mutters, crossing her arms, but Katara rolls her eyes.\n\u201cI mean, I can get the servants to arrange that.\u201d\nToph shoots her a glare, but Katara is utterly immune to those by now, so she simply raises an eyebrow. \u201cFine. Fine! Let\u2019s compose a letter to my parents. I think I can pull out of my inheritance to make up the difference,\u201d she adds in a low voice, as though the idea just occurred to her, and Katara inwardly sighs in relief.\n\u201cExactly,\u201d she replies, pulling out another sheaf of paper. \u201cThat\u2019s a great idea for another way to fund this. Do we address it to your mom or your dad?\u201d\n\u201cMom,\u201d Toph answers shortly. \u201cShe always wants to hear from me anyway, we can fill it with a bunch of nonsense and then tack in the request for money at the end.\u201d\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Katara says, writing  Dear Mother  at the top of the page. \u201cLet\u2019s get started.\u201d\n.\nShe\u2019s standing on the edge of Healer\u2019s Row, looking at the frame of the building that will be the hospital in a few more weeks, while Toph inspects one of the market stalls, when she hears the shout.\n\u201cKatara!\u201d Toph screams, loud and frightened enough to be heard over the sounds of the city. \u201cDuck!\u201d\nThere\u2019s a split-second where it processes \u2013 Toph  never sounds that scared for nothing \u2013 and then she drops to the ground and covers her head as something clatters to the ground not far from her, but before she can look up to see what it is, the earth itself is rising up around it, not two seconds before it explodes, and little pieces of shrapnel and dust shudder off of the box Toph must have bent.\nShe\u2019s shaking uncontrollably as Toph runs up to her, breathing heavily, panic clear on her face.\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she cries, and Katara nods, numb. The noise it made, even boxed in by the ground, even though Toph contained it \u2013 the  noise it made.\nSomeone just tried to kill her, and they tried to take out a whole city block \u2013 along with the new hospital that she\u2019s building \u2013 to do it.\nShe looks around, but the crowds are gathering to see what the commotion is about, and there\u2019s no telling who threw the bomb, from here.\n\u201cDo you know who did it?\u201d she asks, but Toph shakes her head.\n\u201cI just felt someone throwing something at you,\u201d she replies, and Katara sees that she\u2019s shaking, too, maybe even harder. \u201cI didn\u2019t follow them, I wanted to make sure nobody got hurt.\u201d\n\u201cWhy would someone do this?\u201d she asks, but there are a lot of possible answers to that question. Maybe they take issue with the way they\u2019re handling the colonies, maybe they don\u2019t like a Water Tribe woman being involved in their politics, maybe they wanted the healer out of the way so they could take out Zuko. Maybe they just hate her, personally.\nA better, and at the same time worse, question is: how many people feel this way?\nShe scans the crowds for any familiar face, but doesn\u2019t recognize any of them, and in spite of Toph standing next to her with her hand on her shoulder, she suddenly feels very alone.\n.\nZuko is angrier about it than she is. Maybe he\u2019s taking it personally \u2013 that they attacked her because of him \u2013 she isn\u2019t sure, but it\u2019s been a long time since she\u2019s seen him this angry, yelling at his police force to find out who did this and find out where they\u2019re hiding.\n He\u2019s not taking it well, she thinks distantly. He\u2019s scared, and he\u2019s overreacting, and at the wrong people.\nToph hasn\u2019t left her side, although Katara isn\u2019t sure if that\u2019s because she\u2019s afraid they\u2019ll target her (as another foreigner in the Fire Nation\u2019s top leadership) or if that\u2019s because she wants to be able to protect Katara if they try again. If Toph hadn\u2019t been nearby, near enough to shout, near enough to act\u2026\n Toph saved my life, she thinks in that same distant way. Toph was terrified that she hadn\u2019t gotten there in time.\nToph, who always seems so unshakable, even when she\u2019s complaining about boring meetings or yelling about politics being stupid, Toph is still shaking.\nKatara closes her eyes and centers herself, then stands up.\n\u201cZuko,\u201d she says sharply, and he looks at her, paler than usual. \u201cThey already know what they have to do. You can\u2019t yell at them until it un-happens. Calm down.\u201d\nZuko takes a deep breath and looks away, hands clenching into fists. The policemen look uncertain, like they don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve been dismissed, and Zuko doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s about to say anything, so she takes charge.\n\u201cYou\u2019re dismissed,\u201d she says, as calmly as she can. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any leads yet, unfortunately, but I trust you to do the best you can to find the culprit.\u201d\n\u201cYes, milady,\u201d the leader \u2013 a young man by the name of Lu Ten, apparently named in honor of the then-crown-prince \u2013 says, bowing sharply and marching out with his men.\n\u201cZuko,\u201d she repeats, and he flinches.\n\u201cAfter  everything  you\u2019ve done for them,\u201d he growls in a low voice. \u201cFor  us .\u201d\nShe isn\u2019t sure what to say. That change happens like this \u2013 like she told Toph, two steps forward and one step back \u2013 that no one is universally popular and people lash out when they feel unheard? She doesn\u2019t even know  why they did it, if it was against her specifically or against the color of her skin and the country of her birth. Ozai\u2019s poison runs deep in this country, and she\u2019s managed to \u2013 surrounded by people who were cast out by him or who openly supported Iroh \u2013 somehow forget just how entrenched his views on Fire Nation superiority really are out there.\nPeople aren\u2019t always grateful of change, especially when that change is perceived as coming from outside \u2013 in this case, she\u2019s both a woman wielding no small amount of political power, and also unmistakably foreign, an outsider, identifiable from a distance. Spending time with Chunhua, with the ministers, with people who treat her like an equal, she\u2019s managed to forget the fact that Ozai and Azulon and Sozin spent a full century telling the people of this country \u2013 the one she has adopted, intentionally or not \u2013 that everyone who isn\u2019t a native member of the Fire Nation is the enemy, is barbaric, is to be eliminated.\nThese waters run deep. It\u2019ll be long after all of them and probably all of their children are dead before it can ever run clear.\nBut that\u2019s no reason not to try.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll catch him, Zuko,\u201d Toph pipes in, standing up and cracking her knuckles. \u201cI\u2019ll go out there and help them. I\u2019ll be able to keep them safe, too.\u201d\nHe nods tightly, and Toph starts to leave, hesitates, then comes back and gives Katara a tight hug.\n\u201cStay safe in here, okay?\u201d she says quietly. \u201cDon\u2019t go  anywhere alone.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be safe, Toph,\u201d she replies, and Toph nods shortly before leaving, still visibly anxious.\nThere\u2019s a long, taut pause.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere, Zuko,\u201d she says finally, and he takes a deep breath.\n\u201cMaybe you should,\u201d he replies darkly. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t safe \u2013\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t give a  damn  about safe,\u201d she snaps. \u201cI have  work  to do here, and I\u2019m not leaving until it\u2019s done. I\u2019ve promised you, I\u2019ve promised the people. I\u2019m not breaking those promises. I\u2019m not letting them run me off. I\u2019ve never backed down from a fight before,\u201d she goes on, crossing her arms. \u201cI said once that I would never turn my back on people who need me, and I\u2019m not about to start now. People are depending on me. On  us. The future is in our hands, and I\u2019m not about to drop that because I\u2019m  scared.\u201d\nZuko looks at her with an unidentifiable emotion in his face, jaw clenched. \u201cI can\u2019t believe someone would do this,\u201d he says through gritted teeth, and she shakes her head.\n\u201cI can,\u201d she replies, a bit softer. \u201cYour father, your grandfather\u2026 they spent a hundred years telling the people that the Fire Nation was superior to everyone else, and I\u2019m a walking symbol of  everyone else . I can\u2019t change that, and I wouldn\u2019t even if I could,\u201d she adds, even though there\u2019s a part of her \u2013 the small, frightened part of her that feels, right now, like she did when her father walked into their home to find her mother\u2019s body, like the world is falling apart and full of evil people who want to hurt her, specifically, because of who she is \u2013 is thinking about how much easier it would be if she could, or if she could just leave this all behind. But that part of her hasn\u2019t been in charge for a long, long time, and she\u2019s not giving it control today.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d she repeats, placing a hand on his shoulder. \u201cNone of this is going to go away overnight. You can\u2019t make a hundred years of propaganda vanish in five. We\u2019ll be fighting this for the rest of our lives, that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to be. But the only way to make it ever get better is by standing our ground and fighting it and never giving up.\u201d\nZuko nods, swallowing thickly, and then pulls her into a tight hug, tighter than Toph\u2019s was.\n\u201cPromise me you will stay safe,\u201d he says seriously, and she nods into his shoulder.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d she replies. \u201cJust because I plan to stand up to it doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m gonna be stupid.\u201d\n\u201cIf you leave the palace,  please take Toph with you.\u201d\nKatara laughs a little, although she knows it sounds as forced as it feels. \u201cAs if she\u2019d let me leave without her now.\u201d\nHe laughs with her, in that same forced, clipped way, and his arms tighten around her. They stay like that for a long time, until she isn\u2019t sure who\u2019s being comforted here, anymore.\n.\n\u201cDid you find them?\u201d she asks Toph later that night, but Toph scowls into her bowl of soup.\n\u201cNo,\u201d she growls. \u201cWe did find some things, though,\u201d she adds, sighing. \u201cSigns point to the attackers being involved with the New Ozai society. Opinions on the force are divided between them trying to get you out of the way so they could go after Zuko, and them wanting to \u201cpurify\u201d the Fire Nation leadership.\u201d\nKatara flinches at the word  purify, in spite of the fact that she knew this was possible, even likely. It\u2019s probably both, she thinks. \u201cIf it\u2019s\u2026 that second one,\u201d she says delicately, \u201cthen you\u2019re a target, too.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Toph replies, but then squirms a bit. \u201cBut\u2026 well\u2026\u201d\nShe catches on. \u201cFrom a distance, you can pass for Fire Nation,\u201d she infers, and Toph looks away miserably. \u201cStill, you\u2019re not exactly unknown. Just because your skin is paler than mine doesn\u2019t make you safe.\u201d\n\u201cZuko said you were really adamant about not leaving,\u201d Toph says quietly, and she nods.\n\u201cI can\u2019t solve anything from a hiding place,\u201d she answers. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna take any stupid risks or anything, but I\u2019m not backing down, either.\u201d\n\u201cYou want to move forward on the hospital?\u201d\n\u201cOf course I do,\u201d she replies. \u201cSomeone targeting me doesn\u2019t make it any less necessary.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you  dare go out there without me.\u201d\nKatara tries to smile. \u201cI just said, I\u2019m not gonna take any stupid risks. You saved my life,\u201d she adds softly. \u201cThank you for that.\u201d\nToph, to her slight surprise, doesn\u2019t respond with something light-hearted \u2013 it shows just how seriously she\u2019s taking this. \u201cYou know I\u2019m not gonna stand aside and let somebody hurt you,\u201d she says, still scowling and picking at her soup without any apparent desire to eat. \u201cWe\u2019re in this together.\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d she replies, reaching out and taking Toph\u2019s hand. \u201cWe\u2019re in this together.\u201d\n.\nShe determines not to even hesitate, not to give them the satisfaction of thinking that she\u2019s been cowed, and so she and Toph go out the very next day to pick up where they left off, on getting the hospital building finished, and then moving forward on setting it up.\nPeople are whispering all around them, watching her carefully, and she holds her head up high even as a small, frightened voice in the back of her mind wonders how many of them think it\u2019s a tragedy that she wasn\u2019t killed yesterday.\nSun-Li, Chunhua\u2019s young sister \u2013 twelve years old a few weeks ago \u2013 runs up to her, braid flapping behind her. There\u2019s a blue ribbon in her hair, and her hands are full of groceries.\n\u201cKatara!\u201d she cries, and Katara gives her a strained smile.\n\u201cHi, Sun-Li,\u201d she says with forced warmth, and then gestures at Toph. \u201cToph, this is Sun-Li, she\u2019s a friend of mine. Sun-Li, Toph.\u201d\n\u201cHey,\u201d Toph says, and Sun-Li pauses, bowing low. \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d\n\u201cNice to meet you too, miss. Are you going to oversee the building?\u201d\n\u201cWe are,\u201d she replies. \u201cIs the teashop doing okay today?\u201d\nIt\u2019s a belated reaction \u2013 if they\u2019re going after her, they may also target places that she frequents \u2013 but it turns out to be premature, when Sun-Li grins.\n\u201cWe\u2019re great! Sister was really worried about you after yesterday, she\u2019d be happy to see you.\u201d\nKatara smiles with a little more ease. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure to stop by,\u201d she replies, and Sun-Li nods, holding up the bags in her arms.\n\u201cI\u2019m going that way right now, if you wanted to walk with me?\u201d\nShe glances at Toph, who shrugs, and then nods, saying, \u201cOkay,\u201d even though she isn\u2019t quite sure why the young girl wants to walk with her.\n\u201cWe were all  really upset by what happened yesterday,\u201d Sun-Li says, as though making light conversation, as they walk up to the teashop. \u201cChunhua was crying, she said she was scared you\u2019d gotten hurt, or that you\u2019d think everyone in the Fire Nation wanted you to leave.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2026 has crossed my mind,\u201d she admits, and Sun-Li looks up at her with wide, bright eyes.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t!\u201d she cries. \u201cWe  love you. You\u2019ve really listened to us and we really believe in you. That\u2019s why I\u2019m wearing the ribbon,\u201d she adds, swishing her head so that her braid swings back and forth, showing off the blue ribbon. \u201cWe started passing them out this morning, so that you\u2019d know you have people on your side.\u201d\nKatara freezes mid-stride and looks around \u2013 now that she\u2019s looking for it, there are a good number of people wearing blue ribbons, either tied into their hair or around their upper arm or woven into their belts. It\u2019s not everyone, or even most people, but there  are a lot of them, and not all are familiar faces.\nHeat rises to her face and prickles behind her eyes, and her vision blurs.\n We really believe in you.\nChunhua steps out of the teashop, face lighting up as she sees her, and she\u2019s wearing blue ribbons in her hair, too. The teashop seems to be a nexus of them \u2013 everyone inside, that she can see, at least, is wearing one.\n We love you.\n\u201cYou\u2019re okay,\u201d Chunhua gushes, but Katara can\u2019t seem to form words. \u201cWe were so  worried!  I can\u2019t believe somebody tried to hurt you! After everything you\u2019ve done for us!\u201d\n\u201cI \u2013\u201d she starts, but her voice catches in her throat. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize I had this much support,\u201d she manages to choke out, and Chunhua smiles.\n\u201cYou like the ribbons?\u201d she asks brightly. \u201cThey were Sun-Li\u2019s idea, she said we should show you how many people in the Fire Nation are on your side.\u201d\nShe covers her mouth with her hand, unsure how to even begin to articulate what she\u2019s feeling. It runs deeper than simple gratefulness; it\u2019s security, she realizes slowly. Katara always knew how to protect herself, but there\u2019s something about knowing that she is surrounded by friends, by allies, by people who are openly supporting her\u2026 it\u2019s heartening, after a very, very disheartening day yesterday.\n\u201cCan I have one?\u201d Toph asks, and Katara glances at her. \u201cActually, make it two, Sparky will want one once he hears about this.\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Chunhua replies, grinning.\nOf course Zuko will want one, she thinks distantly. Except for maybe Sokka, he\u2019s her biggest fan.\n\u201cYou okay, Sugar Queen?\u201d Toph asks, tacking on the nickname in a transparent attempt to lighten the mood.\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026\u201d she starts, but doesn\u2019t know how to finish the sentence. \u201cThank you,\u201d she tells Chunhua, instead of trying to come up with an answer to Toph, as her eyes fill and brim over with tears. \u201cThank you.\u201d\nChunhua smiles. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to ever feel like you\u2019re not welcome here,\u201d she says seriously. \u201cYou  are. You\u2019re here to help us, of course you\u2019re welcome here. I don\u2019t care what any old Fire Lords of the past have said. You\u2019re my friend, and I\u2019m going to support you.\u201d\nKatara gives her a watery smile, and then a tight hug, which is returned with force.\nIt isn\u2019t much \u2013 they still haven\u2019t caught the guy, they still don\u2019t have much in the way of leads to even start \u2013 but it feels like a big step in the right direction, anyway.\n.\nShe walks away from the teashop feeling energized, feeling less alone; Toph has already tied a ribbon around her arm \u2013 when Katara commented on being a little surprised by her openness, she had actually gotten a little offended, saying, \u201cJust because I make fun of you and yell at you sometimes doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t support you,\u201d like she was genuinely upset at the thought that Katara might not know how much she cared.\n\u201cSeriously, though, this\u2019ll really cheer Sparky up,\u201d Toph says lightly, as they walk to the building site. \u201cI think he\u2019s more upset than you are.\u201d\n\u201cI think so, too,\u201d she replies.\n\u201cWhy do you think that is?\u201d Toph asks, in a strange sort of tone, almost prodding. Katara glances at her sideways.\n\u201cI have no idea,\u201d she deadpans, and Toph sighs, giving no indication of having any ideas as to why that might be, herself.\n\u201cSeriously, though,\u201d she goes on in a lower voice, \u201che\u2019ll be really happy to know that at least a lot of his people love you as much as he does.\u201d\nShe pauses, the breath in her lungs suddenly becoming so much thinner. \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d she asks, but Toph doesn\u2019t give an inch.\n\u201cI  said , he\u2019ll be really happy about this,\u201d she replies in a louder voice, then beckons her to follow. \u201cCome on, I don\u2019t have all day. Let\u2019s get this inspection over with.\u201d\nHealer\u2019s Row isn\u2019t far, and they\u2019re there soon, where it\u2019s going pretty smoothly, but Katara is a bit preoccupied by Toph\u2019s too-casual-to-be-really-casual words, and can only focus so much on how things are progressing. The frame is fully complete, and about half of the inner structure has been finished, and the workers comment to her about how relieved they are to have a decent job right now, does she know what the next building project will be?\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d she replies, with some apology, \u201cbut I was thinking about a school.\u201d\nA school would be good, she thinks, looking at them. Something else they could build, another job they could take on, and which would need near-constant upkeep, guaranteeing them at least some form of work, for quite some time.\nPlus, she promised Chunhua a school, and she\u2019s more determined than ever before to ensure that it happens.\n\u201cLet\u2019s get back to the palace,\u201d she says, and Toph nods, waving at the construction workers as though they\u2019re friends. \u201cDo you know them?\u201d\nToph shrugs. \u201cSort of. I talked to a bunch of them yesterday, to see what they knew. They\u2019re not bad people.\u201d\nKatara looks at her carefully. \u201cYou liked that, didn\u2019t you?\u201d she muses, and Toph gives her an affronted look, so she clarifies: \u201cNot \u2013 I mean, not the attack, but the investigation. You seem\u2026 I don\u2019t know, it just seems to suit you.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely more interesting than politics, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d she mutters, but seems to be mulling it over. \u201cThat\u2019s for  damn sure.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, the day-to-day of politics is pretty boring,\u201d she concedes, stretching her arms out and looking around. There are so many people wearing blue ribbons, so much more than she would have guessed. She supposes that she\u2019s been more visible than she\u2019d thought. \u201cIt\u2019s worth it, but it gets tedious.\u201d\n\u201cUnderstatement of the  century,\u201d Toph replies, and as openly relaxed as she seems, Katara can see her tilting her head this way and that, still looking out for threats and, perhaps, seeing if there\u2019s anything familiar from yesterday. Toph is playing calm, for Katara\u2019s benefit, but Toph is still on-edge.\nIt\u2019s not as though Katara is fully relaxed, herself, but she feels a lot safer with Toph by her side, and with all the blue ribbons around her, than she did right after the attack, when she\u2019d felt completely alone, a blue-and-brown spot in a black-and-white world.\n.\nThe letters start coming in that afternoon.\nThe first one she receives is from Sokka, which is full of freaking out and  tell me you\u2019re okay tell me it\u2019s okay tell me you\u2019ve got Toph by you 24/7 tell me you drowned that guy in his own body fluids tell me you are okay  \u2013 so much of it, in fact, that she\u2019s almost surprised that the words don\u2019t leap off the page and actually yell at her. The second is from Ty Lee, which is almost identical to Sokka\u2019s, and the third is from Suki, which asks if she wants her to come back to the Fire Nation for a while.\nThe fourth is from Mai:  Congrats, it says,  you had your first assassination attempt. Get used to it. It means you\u2019re doing something right. \nThat\u2019s a bit ominous, she thinks.\nThe fifth is from Aang.\n Katara, he starts, and she can almost hear him taking a deep breath while trying to think of what to write,  I\u2019m so sorry this happened to you, and I\u2019m glad to hear that you\u2019re safe. Please stay safe. You\u2019re too important to the world for us to lose. \n\n I also wanted to apologize for what I said in Ba Sing Se. You\u2019re the bravest person I\u2019ve ever met, please don\u2019t ever think otherwise. I hope this finds you safe, and happy. \n\n\n Your friend, always, Aang. \n\nAfter replying to all of them \u2013 some with a lot more comforting required than others, and she isn\u2019t entirely certain that Sokka isn\u2019t already on a boat over \u2013 except the last, which she thinks she\u2019ll need much more time to process and think up a response to, she goes up to the roof. It\u2019s been a while since she\u2019s been up here, too busy with the planning and yesterday too anxious to dare go out in the open, and she\u2019d almost forgotten how calm it is, how peaceful.\nShe\u2019s beginning to think that Amaya the First didn\u2019t make this as a romantic getaway, after all. Maybe she just built it as a place to hide, for a little while, when things got too scary or overwhelming or heavy down below in the palace.\nThe letter from Aang is what she wanted to hear on the balcony, now several months ago, and she wonders how much of it was motivated by the fear of her dying before he could make amends \u2013 even so, she thinks, it\u2019s nice to know that he wants to make amends at all.\nIt\u2019s nice to know that maybe they can repair things, at least enough that they can talk to each other again.\n\u201cI wondered if I\u2019d find you here,\u201d Zuko says, startling her a bit, since she hadn\u2019t heard the door open, but she shifts over to give him room to sit down all the same. He stays standing.\n\u201cI needed to get some air,\u201d she replies, smiling wanly. \u201cToph seems to be getting along well with the police force.\u201d\n\u201cI think they\u2019re more afraid of her than they are me,\u201d he deadpans, running a hand through his hair.\n\u201cSomething on your mind?\u201d she asks, and he laughs a little, sort of desperately.\n\u201cA lot of things,\u201d he replies, but holds out a hand. \u201cRight now, I just wanted to show you, the turtleducks have hatched.\u201d\nShe bolts upright without stopping to let him help her up. That, she thinks, is  exactly what she needs right now: ridiculously-adorable baby animals. He snickers at her enthusiasm, but looks tired.\nThey arrive in the private garden to the sound of quiet, high-pitched quacking, and Katara melts inside when she sees them \u2013 they\u2019re so tiny, and so downy, with orange-brown fluff sticking out all around their little shells as they swim around their mother, begging her to feed them.\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she says faintly, \u201cthey  are even cuter than I thought they\u2019d be.\u201d\n\u201cI felt like we could both use this,\u201d he replies, snickering again. \u201cThey\u2019re soft, too,\u201d he adds.\nAnd alive, she thinks, as he picks one up and hands it to her. Soft and alive and quacking and nuzzling her hand, totally unaware of how ungrateful and awful the world can be sometimes, but also unaware of how wonderful and rewarding it can be, too.\nZuko has a blue ribbon tied around his wrist.\nMaybe they\u2019ll catch the guy \u2013 actually, no, she knows Toph won\u2019t stop until she has him wrapped up in rock and behind bars, so they\u2019ll definitely catch the guy, but it\u2019s only maybe that they\u2019ll catch the rest of whoever he was working for. Or maybe they\u2019ll just disappear into the jungles until they fade away.\nMaybe she\u2019ll live to see the Fire Nation fully accept her the way Chunhua has. She\u2019s off to a great start, if the number of ribbons is any indication; maybe there will always be people who hate her based solely on where she came from and the element she bends, who will never, ever give her a chance.\nBut eventually, they\u2019ll fade away, too, even if it\u2019s long after she\u2019s gone and all that\u2019s left is her legacy, her hospital and her school and whatever else she pushes for, whatever else she leaves here. Maybe that\u2019ll only be policy and a few buildings. Maybe that\u2019ll be more.\nThe turtleduck waddles up her arm and sits itself on her shoulder, snuggling up against her neck, its down tickling her and its light warmth spreading much further than its size would suggest.\nMaybe she and Aang will be real friends again someday. Maybe they\u2019ll just be co-workers in rebuilding the world.\nPeace isn\u2019t something that falls on you, she\u2019s slowly realizing, it isn\u2019t something that just happens when the fighting stops \u2013 peace is something you  build, brick by brick by tedious brick, until finally you look up and you\u2019ve got a foundation of something solid and lasting. Peace isn\u2019t something you find; it\u2019s something you make for yourself, out of the ruins left behind by war and heartbreak and loss. It\u2019s something you put together, out of what\u2019s left after the storm has passed.\nShe reaches out and takes Zuko\u2019s hand, then, on impulse, leans up and kisses his cheek, being careful not to disturb the turtleduck.\n\n He\u2019ll be happy to know that a least a lot of his people love you as much as he does. \n\nToph  would know.\n\u201cKatara\u2026\u201d he says softly, and she smiles, and he seems to lose track of his thoughts. \u201cThank you, for everything.\u201d\n\u201cI told you,\u201d she replies, \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d\n\u201cYou promise?\u201d he asks, squeezing her hand tightly.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d she says, leaning her head on his shoulder. \u201cI promise.\u201d\n.\n.\n coda   \u2013 \nThey're all there for the ground-breaking ceremony, just before the sixth Council of Four is scheduled to take place, on what they've (reluctantly, in some cases; Sokka in particular was pushing for something related to a fifth element) decided to call Republic City. \"Because it will  be a republic,\" Aang had explained. \"A place where everyone is represented and everyone has a voice.\"\nSokka, Katara suspects, was simply bitter about not being able to include his puns on national scale.\n\u201cCome  on, Katara,\u201d he grumbles to her, crossing his arms. \u201cWe had the perfect opportunity to place my wit on the map for all of history. I can't  believe you've betrayed me like this, siding with 'Republic City'. That's so boring!\u201d\n\u201cWit?\u201d she counters, hands on her hips. \u201c\u201cAether City\u201d is your definition of wit?\"\n\u201cWell, if anyone had even  considered any of my other ideas\u2026\u201d\nBehind him, Suki rolls her eyes and makes a hand motion to imitate a flapping mouth, and Katara snickers.\n\u201cHow much of this have you had to listen to?\u201d she asks, leaning around Sokka.\n\u201cYou would not  believe,\u201d she replies fervently.\nSuki sighs heavily in exasperation, but she fingers the pendant on her neck all the same. It\u2019s not perfect, but he put a lot of work into it, and it suits her \u2013 it suits  them, and not just Sokka and Suki. It\u2019s imperfect, but it\u2019s made with love and care and hope, and so it\u2019s something to be proud of.\nAang walks up from behind her and sighs. \u201cHe won\u2019t let go of \u201cAether City,\u201d will he?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019ll have it carved on his grave,\u201d Katara replies. \u201cHow are things at the Air Temple?\u201d\n\u201cPretty good,\u201d he answers, smiling. \u201cI think some of the Acolytes are pretty much masters at this point, they\u2019re starting to take Air Nomad philosophy and apply it to the modern world. They\u2019re excited about the city.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d she says, and means it. \u201cI\u2019m really happy for you.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he says slowly. \u201cI hear there\u2019s reason for congratulations to you, too.\u201d\nHer breath catches in her throat a bit, but she\u2019s wearing the headpiece in her hair \u2013 it\u2019s not like she came here to hide it.\n\u201cFire Lady Katara,\u201d Aang muses. \u201cIt\u2019s got a good ring to it. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re happy,\u201d he adds in a quiet voice. \u201cI really am.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she says, matching his volume. \u201cIt means a lot. I know we\u2019ve had a rocky path, but\u2026 I\u2019m glad we can stand here, as friends.\u201d\n\u201cMe too,\u201d he replies, with a genuine smile. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna be an amazing Fire Lady.\u201d\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Toph cries, joining them and barging into the conversation with all the subtlety of a mallet, \u201clet\u2019s get the future started!\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Katara says, as they walk forward to join Zuko and the builders at the site. \u201cLet\u2019s get the future started.\u201d"
