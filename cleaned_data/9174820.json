    "text": "Consciousness returned slowly to Harry.\nThe first thing he became aware of was a strange, rushing sensation like a gust of wind blowing through his chest, or his stomach -- he wasn\u2019t sure which. But it radiated out through his veins and he could sense it in his whole body, from his hair to his toes. It... vibrated, vague and unsettling.\nHis other senses began returning to him, faint voices talking over each other in angry whispers, a sharp potion-like odor that gave cognizance to his surroundings: he was in the medical wing, yes. Madam Pomfrey was one of the voices.\nStruggling a bit against the whirl of his mind, Harry forced his eyes open. He was greeted by the sight of people standing around his bed: Madam Pomfrey was circling his feet with her wand and murmuring incantations and McGonagall was standing close to his head, her face tight with worry. But her gaze was off to his left, on a man standing in between his and another bed.\nHarry cleared his throat, and watched as three sets of eyes swiveled in his direction. The man was Professor Highlash, the new teacher for Advanced Magical Theory, and with a jolt, Harry began piecing together what happened. He jerked, trying to sit up, and was firmly pushed back into the pillows by McGonagall\u2019s implacable hand.\n\u201cPotter. How you do you feel?\u201d\nHarry cleared his throat again, eyes flicking from one face to another. \u201cBit weird. What happened? I remember\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d Pomfrey asked, still circling her wand, only now over his stomach. The twisty feeling intensified, verging on discomfort.\n\u201cWe were in Advanced Theory\u2026\u201d Harry said tentatively, glancing over at Highlash, who nodded with a severe look on his ancient face, \u201cpracticing connecting our minds with our magical cores. And\u2026 something happened. What happened?\u201d\nThe adults exchanged looks that he couldn\u2019t interpret and dread twisted inside Harry alongside the new sensation. Was that it? Had something happened to his magic? McGonagall laid a gentle hand on his shoulder, and Harry turned his face up to her in raw panic.\n\u201cThere was an\u2026 incident, with your magical core,\u201d she told him quietly.\nHarry pushed back a brief wave of nausea and screwed up his courage. \u201cAm I\u2026 Am I a squib now, or something?\u201d\nPomfrey, who had finished circling his head with her wand, withdrew it abruptly. Cheerfully, she announced, \u201cAll there!\u201d her voice extremely confident and louder than anyone had been yet. Harry sagged against his pillows with relief and began to smile until he noticed another look being exchanged among the adults.\nUncertainly, he looked at Professor Highlash. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\nHighlash looked down to the bed next to him silently. McGonagall answered. \u201cYou tried to intervene when you saw a student attempt to hex someone standing near you. Unfortunately, your shield charm -- though skillful as ever, Potter -- was not quite quick enough. The hex penetrated its intended target and your shield bounced the hex back toward you.\u201d\nHarry had a sudden blurred memory of Zacharias Smith casting his wand with a muttered snicker in his and Malfoy\u2019s direction, and of his own automatic response. He was astonished his shield hadn\u2019t worked in time, but chose not to comment on it. \u201c\nSmith,\u201d Harry supplied grimly. \u201cBloody coward.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed.\u201d McGonagall\u2019s lips were pursed tightly. \u201cHe has been dealt with.\u201d\n\u201cWhat was the hex he sent?\u201d\n\u201cApparently, he thought it would be amusing to bind Mr. Malfoy\u2019s mouth closed. Unfortunately \u2014 for many reasons \u2014 the binding spell was miscast,\u201d McGonagall said with another glance to the bed next to him. Harry thought for a moment about the funny sensation inside him.\nHe sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s Malfoy over there, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cYes. He should wake up shortly.\u201d\nAs if on cue, Malfoy gave a quiet, pained moan and made a bucking motion that Harry could sense even without being able to see him. He saw Highlash murmur something to Pomfrey, who was performing her tests on Malfoy\u2019s midsection. She nodded and removed herself, bustling back quickly with a vial of what Harry recognized as Calming Draught. Pomfrey waited next to Highlash for a moment as the teacher murmured something to Malfoy, and then moved out of the way, no longer obstructing Harry\u2019s view.\nAs Pomfrey handed the potion to Malfoy and resumed her tests, Harry looked long and hard at him. Malfoy gulped down the contents of the draught rather frantically. His face was white and had a greasy sheen to it. He seemed to be attempting to keep still.\nHighlash waited until some of the tension drained from Malfoy\u2019s body, then addressed them both from the foot of their beds, his gravelly voice low and serious. \u201cWe wanted to wait for both of you to be awake to fully explain what\u2019s happened.\u201d\nHarry flicked another glance to Malfoy, who seemed a bit steadier, but whose face showed the same fear Harry felt.\nMalfoy gripped the sheets beneath him and licked his lips. \u201cSomething is wrong with my core,\u201d he said, voice shaking. \u201cSmith\u2026\u201d\nHighlash nodded. \u201cNot wrong, exactly. Your cores have not been drained. Power remains intact for both of you\u2014 Correct, Madam Pomfrey?\u201d\nMadam Pomfrey moved her wand away from Malfoy\u2019s head. \u201cYes, both fully intact and at full strength. But the initial tests hold true; your theory was correct.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2014 What theory?\u201d Harry asked into the sudden pause.\n\u201cSmith sent a miscalculated binding spell that hit you, Mr. Malfoy,\u201d Highlash said with a nod in his direction, \u201cand rebounded to you, Mr. Potter, when it hit the shield charm you had aimed at him. The problem with this is that you both had your guards down and were mentally accessing your cores at the moment, the essence of which drew the binding spell.\u201d\n\u201cPotter\u2019s magic!\u201d Malfoy burst out, squirming with sick realization. He shot Harry a nasty look. \u201cIt\u2019s Potter\u2019s magic, what I feel.\u201d\nHarry started, discomfited when McGonagall pressed a light hand against his shoulder again. \u201cWait, what?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid so,\u201d Highlash confirmed. \u201cThe tests show that your cores have\u2014 Well, fused, for lack of a better word. Magically intertwined. We were hoping that the effects wouldn\u2019t be as strong as they apparently are but if you\u2019re already sensing it, the spell has taken full hold.\u201d\nHarry concentrated on that strange sensation, that silky twisting, like rivulets of water flowing through him. His heart thumped heavily and his voice came out flat. \u201cHow long will it last?\u201d\nHighlash splayed his hands. \u201cWe can\u2019t be sure. Apparently, Mr. Smith intended his original spell to last for a week. There have been a few instances of this, particularly for Unspeakables and Aurors and those who consciously access their magical cores on a regular basis \u2014 so there is a basis for similar occurrences that we\u2019re aware of \u2014 but it is still rare. Extremely rare, indeed.\n\u201cIt should wear off on its own as soon as the original spell was meant to but there are several different variables to account for to ensure that can happen,\u201d he finished, looking back and forth between them as though he couldn\u2019t figure out where to settle his eyes.\nMalfoy made a disgusted noise in the back of his throat and Harry looked over at him again. \u201cSo, what then?\" he scoffed. \u201cWe can\u2019t do magic? Maybe that\u2019ll help Potter to reign in his Savior tendencies and ensure no one else gets caught in the backlash of them again.\u201d\nHarry fought back a wave of fury. \u201cI was trying to help you, Malfoy. Merlin knows why. I guess you just need a lot of saving, don\u2019t you? Maybe next time I\u2019ll let you get blasted.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d prefer that over this,\u201d Malfoy said, sneering. \u201cThis is disgusting, to be forced to feel\u2014 to feel\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a picnic for me, either,\u201d Harry retorted. He shifted uneasily as the vibration, that friction, began to grow and become uncomfortable. It settled somewhere in his ribcage, like heartburn, and almost felt like an itch that had been going on too long.\nMalfoy looked distinctly scratchy too. He pressed his hands flat over his stomach and shot a hateful look in Harry\u2019s direction.\nHighlash stepped forward and held up a hand. \u201cThis is exactly what I mean. Not only will you have to learn to work together, you will both need to figure out a way to utilise your cores as one. There could be repercussions for your magic if you\u2019re unable to do that.\u201d\nMalfoy\u2019s sneer dropped off his face and went back to looking scared. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cI mean that not only do you need to continue using your magic to ensure that your cores remain at full strength \u2014 think of it as magical exercise \u2014 but you need to find a place of connectivity between them. Negative emotions affect your magic in much the same way curses can and when your cores do not act in symmetry, you\u2019re both in danger of shredding them.\u201d\nHarry felt the blood drain from his face. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014 I don\u2019t understand\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYour cores are one now,\u201d Highlash spelled out in a severe tone. \u201cThey need to behave as such or else.\u201d\nThere was a long silence. Finally, Malfoy took a deep breath and lifted his face toward Highlash. \u201cHis magic is\u2026 it\u2019s too strong, too uncontrolled,\u201d Malfoy said grudgingly. \u201cHow am I going to get it to listen to me?\u201d\nHarry nodded. \u201cHis is strange too. It's too... smooth, too shifty. It won\u2019t stay still.\u201d\nMcGonagall pressed her hand on Harry\u2019s shoulder again and this time he let himself take comfort from it. \u201cThere are techniques we will go over shortly. For the time being, you and Mr. Malfoy will be paired in any classes you share, and will have free periods in any that you don\u2019t. During some of these, you will work with Professor Highlash.\u201d\nHarry darted another look at Malfoy, who was staring at him with narrow grey eyes. \u201cWhy? Why do we have to partner?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s imperative you stay near one another until the binding has worn off. A magical core physically separated from a wizard is a very grave thing. Frankly, being rendered a squib would not be the worst of it,\u201d Highlash said, almost gently.\nHarry latched onto the least frightening thing part of that. \u201cHow \u2018near each other?\u2019 We\u2019re in different dorms.\u201d\nThe headmistresses shook her head minutely. \u201cYou will be rooming together for the duration. The rooms in the guests\u2019 tower are completely empty \u2014 one of them will be made up for you.\u201d\nAnother disgusted noise came from Malfoy\u2019s direction and Harry determinedly did not look at him, instead directing his inquiry at Highlash. \u201cCan\u2019t we just\u2026 You know, be around each other a lot during the day? Maybe room next to each other?\u201d\n\u201cThe effects will get stronger as the spell wears on, I\u2019m sorry to say. While it may be possible for you two to sleep apart, at least tonight, it would not be advisable for either of you to have a distance further than a foot between you. If the spell strengthened while you were sleeping, for example, there could be some severe consequences.\u201d\nHarry nodded dully, picking at a loose thread in his bedsheet and finally McGonagall moved away from his bedside. He looked up at her, noting that some of the tightness of her face had faded.\n\u201cWell, gentlemen, once you\u2019re fully stabilized, I suggest you eat a proper dinner and collect your belongings. I shall meet you in front of the guest dormitories at eight o\u2019clock,\u201d she said. \u201cI trust that you will both have the sufficient sense to adhere to Professor Highlash\u2019s warnings and endure this with the decorum I\u2019m\u2026 sure\u2026 you\u2019re both capable of.\u201d\nHarry and Malfoy exchanged sardonic glances as she swept out in perhaps the first moment of full agreement between them, ever.\n***\nIt was much harder to walk into the Great Hall for dinner than Harry had thought it would be. He and Malfoy had barely exchanged two words since leaving the medical wing \u2014 those two being monosyllabic \u2014 and yet Harry could already feel the heightened strain on the connection between them: when Malfoy walked too fast ahead of him on those damned long legs of his, that immense ache would return as a deep itch he could not scratch.\nHarry was pretty sure it was happening to Malfoy, too. Whenever he was too far ahead, he would slow abruptly, waiting for Harry to pull up beside him. It simply became more comfortable to walk shoulder-to-shoulder, so they did that, in silence.\nWhen they finally walked into the Great Hall, a hush swept over the rowdy crowd. Harry had gotten used to stares, even from those classmates who had known him for years, but this felt different -- almost ominous in its completeness. The hush was broken by Ron\u2019s loud, \u201cHarry!\u201d and with relief, he saw Ron and Hermione get up from their seats and run over to his side.\nHermione threw herself into his arms, her thick frizz of curls falling into his face and hiding his view. He clutched at her tightly for a moment. Ron waited until she released him before grabbing Harry\u2019s arm and leading him over to the Gryffindor table. Malfoy stood in place for a split second, then followed wordlessly, which earned him a sneer from Ron.\n\u201cOi, what d'you think you're doing, Malfoy?\u201d\n\u201cLeave it, Ron,\u201d Harry said tiredly. Hermione gave him a worried look and he shot her what he hoped was a reassuring smile.\n\u201cWhat happened, Harry?\u201d she asked as they sat. Malfoy took a place at the edge of the long bench, with as much of the foot of distance allowed between them as he could manage. \u201cProfessor McGonagall wouldn\u2019t let us in to see you and wouldn\u2019t tell us what had happened. All we saw was you and Malfoy, unconscious, and surrounded by a, a light for a few minutes. They took Zacharias away right after.\u201d\n\u201cI heard he was expelled,\u201d Ron supplied around a mouthful of food.\nHermione nodded earnestly. \u201cEveryone\u2019s talking about it. They said he cursed you and Malfoy, but\u2014\u201c\nHarry began piling his own plate with roast beef, mushrooms, and three different types of potatoes. \u201cHe did. He was aiming for Malfoy, and I put up a shield charm that backfired.\u201d\n\u201cMerlin, Harry, why\u2019d you do that?\u201d Ron blurted, eyes wide.\nMalfoy shifted uncomfortably next to him and Harry noticed he hadn\u2019t started eating. Without thinking, he began loading another plate with the roast chicken, dinner rolls, and everything green he could see. He shoved it unceremoniously in front of Malfoy and turned back to Ron with a grimace.\n\u201cHabit, I guess,\u201d he muttered, then turned back to Malfoy, who was staring down at his plate with a look of shock. \u201cYou should eat. They said we need to keep our strength up.\u201d Malfoy gave him a furtive glance and nodded once before primly tucking in to his food.\nHarry began eating, as well. Between bites, quietly, he relayed as much information as he knew. Ron\u2019s face bleached itself of color, leaving his freckles standing out in sharp relief when Harry got to the part about his and Malfoy\u2019s cores being entwined. Hermione chewes on her lower lip. When he'd finished talking, both of them were silent.\n\u201cBlimey, that\u2019s bad,\u201d Ron finally murmured, taking a quick glance around to see who was still listening. Harry followed his eyes; a lot of people were. Fortunately, they had been speaking quietly enough -- and were sitting far enough away from the rest of the table -- that everyone would just have to live with their curiosity.\n\u201cSo we\u2019ve been told,\u201d Harry said darkly. \u201cBut whatever. I lived through last year, I can get through a week of this, right?\u201d He jerked his head in Malfoy\u2019s direction. Malfoy responded by scooting ever-so-slightly closer to him. A tension Harry hadn\u2019t been aware of building inside himself eased off slightly.\n\u201cHarry,\u201d Hermione said slowly, \u201cI mean, of course you can, but I hope you understand the seriousness of this. There are a lot of theories about the magical core of witches and wizards, but it\u2019s not as though they can be fully studied, can they? We know that personal signatures are traceable and are in the blood, but beyond that, it\u2019s mostly guesswork. People have died from depletion of their magical core.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what Highlash intimated,\u201d Malfoy said stiffly, weighing in for the first time. \u201cBut he said there\u2019s precedent for this sort of situation.\u201d\nHermione seemed to struggle with speaking to him for a moment before her natural inquisitiveness got the better of her. \u201cWith who? When?\u201d\nMalfoy glanced at her and didn\u2019t say anything. Harry sighed. \u201cAurors,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Unspeakables. But he said it should just wear off when the original spell was supposed to, if we\u2019re careful. We\u2019re meeting with him tomorrow.\u201d\nThat itch was back. Harry swallowed hard didn\u2019t wait for Malfoy, scooting closer until their shoulders were brushing again. An immediate rush of calm filled his centre, where Malfoy\u2019s annoying magical core had been squirming in the worst way. It was as though a brewing storm had become a light, spring rain.\nHermione settled back into her seat, casting a questioning look between the two of them. \u201cThat\u2019s good to know,\u201d she said uncertainly. \u201cThat means there\u2019ll be something I can research on the subject.\u201d\nHarry took a gulp of pumpkin juice and looked down at his empty plate, then at Malfoy\u2019s. Malfoy had eaten maybe half of what Harry had given him, but that was good enough for him. He nudged Malfoy again and got a surprised jerk in response. \u201cYou ready?\u201d\n\u201cI suppose,\u201d Malfoy gritted out, \u201cif you\u2019re done stuffing your face.\u201d\nHarry felt a slow burn of anger rise but tamped it down. \u201cNot quite,\u201d he said lightly jusy to irritate him. He grabbed a couple of chocolate pasties with one hand. \u201cBut I can finish on the way.\u201d\nMalfoy sneered at him. \u201cYou have absolutely no manners, do you? One would think they starved you, growing up.\u201d\nLike a flash, Harry\u2019s carefully reigned anger transformed into embarrassed fury. He found himself stepping closer to Malfoy wand already in hand. Malfoy looked stunned at his reaction and took a quick step away, then another, as Hermione caught Harry\u2019s arm.\n\u201cHarry, he doesn\u2019t know,\u201d she said in a low voice that finally penetrated the fog in his head. \u201cHe\u2019s just being nasty.\u201d\nHarry slowly became aware of the buzz of other voices beginning to whisper and with it, the simmering pain of Malfoy\u2019s core reacting with his. Malfoy stood stock-still in front of him, grey eyes wide, mouth agape. With monumental control, Harry took a deep breath. He exhaled harshly. \u201cJust keep your bloody mouth shut, Malfoy, and maybe we can get through this. Let\u2019s go.\u201d\nHarry stalked away, trying to ignore the raw plummet in his chest at separating -- and the effortless settling inside that happened when Malfoy caught up.\n***\nThey made haste to the Slytherin dormitories. The common room was just as Harry had remembered it: stone walls, eerie green cast from the lake, posh fireplace. He avoided looking at anyone as his presence was noticed. Blaise Zabini, one of the few Slytherins to return to eighth year, was sitting with Pansy Parkinson and a slightly younger female student Harry didn\u2019t recognize, on a plush, Chesterfield sofa.\n\u201cSo it\u2019s true, then,\u201d Zabini called out. Malfoy headed over to his friends and Harry folllwed. It was only fair, he reasoned reluctantly, trying to hold back his irritation. After all, Malfoy hadn\u2019t complained about sitting with Harry\u2019s friends over dinner \u2014 at least not overtly. Zabini was grinning in a way that made Harry uncomfortable. \u201cSlughorn came in and admonished us to give you two an \u2018easy time of it,\u2019 and said you\u2019re moving in together. Nott told me he heard Smith had cast a marriage spell at the two of you.\u201d\nMalfoy snorted and perched on the arm of the sofa. Harry stood as close as he could without touching him.\n\u201cYou know better than to listen to rumors,\u201d Malfoy said haughtily. \u201cAnd because of that, I\u2019ll spare you the details. Suffice it to say, I\u2019m stuck with Potter for a few days.\u201d\nParkinson\u2019s eyes were bright with glee. \u201cOh, but Draco, rumors are so much fun. Why on earth wouldn\u2019t we listen to them?\u201d Her voice became sly. \u201cAnd maybe add to them if we don\u2019t have enough real information?\u201d\nMalfoy rolled his eyes. \u201cQuit it, Pans. Potter and I are glued together for a week or so. That bitter dolt of a wizard, Smith, thought it\u2019d be funny to try to ruin my life for a bit -- as if he has the talent or power to do so. Just the same shit we\u2019ve been dealing with since\u2026 Well. Potter here was trying to maintain his hero status and, shockingly, it didn\u2019t work out this time.\u201d\n\u201cWhat same shit?\u201d Harry cut in, ignoring the insult. Parkinson looked at him levelly and Harry quite suddenly remembered the note he had received over the summer from her. It had been filled with sardonic comments about his hair and clothing, but somewhere buried in the subtext had seemed to be a genuine apology for attempting to give him up to Voldemort. He had received a few like it, even one from Malfoy, which he immediately dismissed from his mind. He returned her look and gave her a half smile.\nWith a sniff, she looked away. \u201cThe same shit all Slytherins have been dealing with from the other Houses and even a few of the professors. A lot of people aren\u2019t too happy that some of us came back, or that they decided to keep this House at all,\u201d she said, casually studying her silver-polished nails.\n\u201cBut that\u2019s\u2014\u201c Harry's objection was cut off by Malfoy.\n\u201cShut it, Pansy, or he\u2019ll decide we\u2019re another cause,\u201d Malfoy said derisively. Zabini chuckled, watching Harry with a perceptive tilt of his head.\n\u201cFine, fine,\u201d she said airily, miming locking her mouth and throwing away the key. \u201cGo live your dream, Draco. I\u2019ll stay out of it.\u201d\n\u201cLiar,\u201d Zabini coughed. Parkinson smacked him on the shoulder, flashing a wicked grin.\n\u201cAre you okay, Draco?\u201d The younger girl asked in a pleasantly delicate voice. She was rather pretty, Harry noticed objectively, with deep brown hair, matching eyes, and pale skin. \u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d\nDraco tensed up for the first time since returning to the common room. Harry felt it at his shoulder first, where they were touching, that slight clench of muscles and then \u2014 strangely \u2014 in his midsection, like something unpleasant winding up tightly. He looked at Malfoy in question.\n\u201cPerfectly fine, Astoria,\u201d he muttered, not looking at her. \u201cNo need. We should get going.\u201d\nHe grabbed Harry\u2019s arm and began walking off. Behind him, Harry could hear Zabini and Parkinson hoot indecent teases as he and Malfoy ducked into a stone hallway that led to the dorms. When they were out of sight, Draco dropped his arm and pushed open the third heavy stone door they came to. Harry followed Malfoy in and surveyed the room as Malfoy flicked his wand and things began to fly out of his trunk.\nMalfoy\u2019s room was\u2026 rather cosy, Harry thought, walking around to keep close to him as he shrank his things and shoved them into a leather tote. Harry could feel Malfoy\u2019s spells like a flicker on his core, but the discomfort of it wasn\u2019t so bad and he continued looking around. The walls were stone and there were still those green shadows on everything, but Malfoy had photos next to his bed of his family and there was a merry fire crackling in the hearth in the corner of the room, warming it up.\n\u201cI like the fire,\u201d Harry said inanely, having had enough of the silent treatment. \u201cWe don\u2019t have fireplaces in our dorms -- only the common room. \u2026But I guess you\u2019ll see soon enough, right?\u201d\nFor a minute, Harry thought he wouldn\u2019t answer, but then Malfoy grudgingly said, \u201cIt\u2019s the lake. The chill seeps in through the walls and the fire keeps it away. They\u2019re in all the rooms.\u201d\nHarry nodded. He hesitated. \u201cWho was that girl?\u201d\nMalfoy gusted out an irritated exhale. \u201cFriend of the family,\u201d he said curtly.\n\u201cBecause I felt\u2026 I mean, I could feel\u2026\u201d\n\u201cMerlin, Potter, you think I want to talk about your feelings?\u201d\n\u201cActually, I was talking about yours,\u201d Harry continued stubbornly. \u201cI could feel your reaction to her. I didn\u2019t know that was a side-effect of\u2014 of this,\u201d he finished, gesturing between them.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t either,\u201d Malfoy said grimly. \u201cJust keep to your own business, okay?\u201d\nHarry sighed. \u201cFine.\u201d\nMalfoy finished up and they made headed to the Gryffindor tower. Harry expected to make short work of getting his things, but got sidelined by Neville, who was, \u201csure glad this one wasn\u2019t my fault, mate,\" and Ron, who made sure Malfoy heard his gagging noises, and finally Ginny, who glared at Malfoy with implicit threat.\n\u201cTake care of yourself, Harry,\u201d she murmured, clutching tightly at his hands for a moment. He gave her a quick grin and dropped his chin on the top of her head in a light hug, inhaling the scent of her hair \u2014 he always had loved her hair \u2014 before moving away. He felt the same sense of tightness he had in the Slytherin dungeon, only this time the coil felt ready to spring and Harry threw a look at Malfoy.\n\u201cWill do, Gin.\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re quite done groping each other,\u201d Malfoy said in a bored voice, \u201cit\u2019s nearly eight and you haven\u2019t packed yet.\u201d\n\u201cOh, shit,\u201d Harry blurted. He cast a quick spell to check to ensure Malfoy wasn\u2019t having him on, but no \u2014 it was five till. He pointed his wand at the door and sent a Patronus ahead of them to let McGonagall know they were running a behind and heard Malfoy grunt a little at it. He mumbled an apology and led Malfoy to his room.\nQuickly, Harry stuffed his school robes, Invisibility cloak, map, and some random clothing into the little leather bag Hermione had given him for his birthday, which had an undetectable extension charm similar to the one she had made the previous year. He threw in his books, pyjamas, and toiletries, and tightened the drawstring at the top to close it, then looped it around his neck. He turned to find Malfoy immediately next to him, so close Harry could feel the heat coming off him, and an oddly pleanant dizziness stilled him for a moment.\nMalfoy was looking around. \u201cIt\u2019s so\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Harry challenged.\n\u201cRed,\u201d Malfoy said, not bothering to mask his disdain.\nMalfoy blinked at Harry's sudden grin, but his mouth seemed to flick up at the corners in a barely-there, return smile. \u201cIt is, at that,\" Harry said. \"Come on. McGonagall\u2019s waiting.\u201d\nShe was, in fact. She stood patiently at the door that led to the guest's quarters and gave them a small, approving smile when they reached her. \u201cThank you for the Patronus, Potter. It was courteous of you.\u201d\n\u201cSure thing. Sorry we\u2019re late.\u201d\n\u201cHow are you both feeling?\u201d she asked.\nHarry and Malfoy exchanged quick looks. When Malfoy was silent, Harry blurted, \u201cWe can feel it when the other does magic.\u201d\nShe nodded thoughtfully. \u201cOf course. The link between you ties each of you to the other\u2019s actions. Anything else? Feeling ill in any way?\u201d\n\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Harry said, hesitating. \u201cBut we can \u2014 or at least I can, so far \u2014 feel, or sense, what the other is feeling too.\u201d\nMalfoy sighed. \u201cI can, as well. I just chose not to natter on about it like a prat.\u201d\nHarry bristled and McGonagall raised her eyebrow at Malfoy, who dropped his head and shrugged, sort of feebly. \u201cSorry.\u201d\n\u201cWell, then.\u201d McGonagall turned. She tapped the wooden door twice with her wand and murmured, \u201cFawkes.\u201d\nThe door opened and they stepped inside to follow her up a long, narrow stone staircase that led to a wide hallway, dotted with doors. She opened the first one they came to and Harry braced himself.\nIt\u2026 wasn\u2019t bad, actually. He didn\u2019t quite know what he\u2019d been expecting, but something more like how he'd envisioned Professor's quarters, maybe, filled with bookshelves or strange portraits of disapproving adults. In fact, there was only one painting, above the large stone fireplace, and it depicted a Quidditch match \u2014 a historic one, if the uniforms were anything to judge by. The rest of the room was very comfortable-looking. The floors were a polished wood, rather than the stone he had become accustomed to and there was a bookshelf along one wall that had some interesting titles in it like Aurors Through The Ages, Potion Remedies For the Practical Witch or Wizard, and Glamour Charms to Help You Be a New You! There were even a couple of Muggle science-fiction books, which Harry had always had a fondness for. There was a large, comfortably stuffed loveseat in pale brown facing the fireplace with a squashy chair angled beside it, as well as a wizarding chess-set between two chairs in the corner beside a long, highly polished desk.\nHarry and Malfoy wandered around together, taking it in and Harry noted Malfoy\u2019s eyes land on a book title, Making Friends Out of Enemies: Bridging the Gap Between Wizarding Worlds. Malfoy snorted lightly.\n\u201cGuest rooms respond to the preferences of their inhabitants, in a way slightly similar to the Room of Requirement,\u201d McGonagall explained briefly. \u201cThe sleeping quarters are beyond that door. They have washroom accommodations attached. The house-elves have been made aware of your occupation here.\n\u201cI\u2019ll leave you to it, Gentlemen. Please attempt to get some sleep tonight, if you can. You're to head to the medical ward immediately if either of you experience core-pain. Send me a Patronus again if you have a need. I\u2019ll see you both in Advanced Transfigurations in the morning,\u201d she said. She hesitated for a moment as though she wanted to say something else, but refrained, leaving quite abruptly.\nQuite abruptly leaving Harry quite alone with Malfoy.\nThe silence was too loud. Harry looked around wildly for a moment. \u201cWant to play some chess? I\u2019m not very good, but we could kill some time before \u2014 you know, before bed.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I do not want to play chess with you, Potter,\u201d Malfoy said tightly. He thrust a hand through his flaxen blond hair, which had gotten a little longer over the summer. His gesture tousled it attractively and Harry looked away, a sudden heat rising in his cheeks.\n\u201cWell, what do you want to do?\u201d\nMalfoy sighed. \u201cLook, I\u2019m tired. Can we just go to sleep?\u201d\nHarry looked back at him closely. Malfoy\u2019s normally pale skin was slightly waxy and his grey eyes were tinged with red.\n\u201cAll right, fine.\u201d He paused. \u201cDo you need to\u2026 Er, shower or something?\u201d\nMalfoy bit his lip. \u201cI\u2019ll\u2026 We can shower in the morning.\u201d\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Harry said with relief, not quite ready to face the idea of sharing a bathing routine yet.\n\u201cBut--\u201d Malfoy\u2019s jaw suddenly flexed, and he seemed to force the words out. \u201cI need to use the loo.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Heat swamped Harry\u2019s face again, crawling down his neck. \u201cYeah, me too. I\u2019ve thought about that a little, actually. We can just, you know, put up a Muffliato -- and maybe a Disillusionment charm or something -- and stand close to the other, turned away.\u201d\nSomething akin to admiration flickered on Malfoy\u2019s face. \u201cThat should be fine.\u201d\nThey walked through the sleeping quarters to the bathroom, Harry diligently ignoring the massive four-poster bed covered Made up in sumptuous, cream bedcovers with scrolls of gold threading. They each paused for a moment to put down their belongings, side by side, on a trunk at the foot of it, before continuing.\nIn the bathroom, he and Malfoy approached the toilet. Malfoy attempted to put up the quieting charm, with no success. Swallowing hard, Harry tried next, to no avail. They looked at each other nervously. Malfoy cast a Disillusionment charm on himself, which flickered briefly and died. A pit grew in Harry's stomach, a tightness that had nothing to do with their link.\nMalfoy was starting to shift from foot to foot and if Harry was honest, the pressure on his own bladder was not quite comfortable either. With frustration, he growled out the Disillusionment incantation rather loudly, flicking his wand forcefully at himself. Nothing happened but for Malfoy\u2019s sudden, panicked groan.\n\u201cStop it, stop it, Potter,\u201d he gasped.\nHarry lowered his wand. \u201cWhat? I\u2019m sorry\u2014 Are you okay?\u201d\n\u201cJust feel dizzy.\u201d Malfoy swallowed convulsively several times, bending at the waist. Harry reached out a tentative hand, grasping Malfoy\u2019s forearm to help steady him. After a beat, Malfoy straightened and shook off Harry\u2019s touch.\n\u201cI\u2019m all right. Your magic\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOh. They said we were supposed to still use it.\u201d\n\u201cI think\u2026\u201d Malfoy tightened his lips. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can use it on ourselves, or each other.\u201d\nHarry fought back an embarrassed cringe \u2014 he had shared a dormitory with several boys for whom the word modesty had no meaning for the last seven years. He was quite used to hearing things and seeing too much in the bathrooms. But this was, well, Malfoy.\nHe took off his glasses and rubbed his face. \u201cFine. It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s nothing. Take your piss, and I\u2019ll do mine, and we\u2019ll go to bed \u2014 go to sleep.\u201d\nMalfoy pierced him with a long, narrow look before suddenly swiveling on his heel. Harry did the same, so they were back to back. He edged away just enough so that they weren\u2019t touching. There was a shift of fabric and a zipping noise and, after a moment, the steady stream of piss into the toilets. Malfoy is holding his cock right now, Harry thought out of nowhere, and swallowed hard again, humiliated that it even occurred to him. The whole situation was entirely too intimate for them and Harry stood still, unsure where to put his hands or eyes or brain, obviously, if it was going to go such places on its own.\nAfter several long seconds, Malfoy finished and flushed, and Harry heard the rustle of clothing being done up. Wordlessly, as if with one mind, he and Malfoy rotated so that Harry was facing the toilet and Malfoy, away. With fumbling fingers, Harry undid his own flies, aimed, and peed. He shook off, flushed, restored his own clothing.\nThey walked over to the sink to take turns washing their hands. Without speaking they returned to the bedroom. Harry straightened his shoulders and followed Malfoy to their belongings.\nMalfoy began hunting through his bag, finally finding what he was looking for. He pulled out a silvery set of nightclothes and unshrank it. Harry did the same, searching through his bag blind \u2014 the opening was just big enough for his arm to fit through \u2014 until he felt the familiar, worn fabric of his Cannon\u2019s T-shirt. He searched for another moment until something flannel slipped through his fingers. He grabbed it gratefully, yanking out his pyjama pants.\n\u201cTurn again?\u201d Malfoy said abruptly, voice oddly rough.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\nThey faced away from each other and disrobed and exchanged muttered curses like, \u201cWatch it, Potter!\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m not the one stabbing you with my arse, you bony tosser,\u201d when their arses bumped, until they were finished.\nFinally done, they faced each other again and Harry surveyed Malfoy, whose sleepwear was made of some kind of silky material. The top two buttons of his shirt were undone at the throat. It left Malfoy\u2019s collarbone exposed, as well as the shiny edge of a scar at the top of his chest. As pyjamas went, they were pretentious and stupid and probably not nearly as comfortable as Harry\u2019s tee and flannels, but\u2026 They suited him. He looked posh and slightly younger and irritatingly attractive.\nHarry\u2019s eyes flicked up to Malfoy\u2019s face. Malfoy was watching him, eyes compelling and thoughtful. He stood in a shaft of moonlight from the window, which made his hair shine silver.\nHarry turned away with a nervous grunt and was surprised when he was halted by Malfoy\u2019s hand on his arm. \u201cWhat were you just thinking about, Potter?\u201d\nDefensively, Harry shrugged him off. \u201cWhy are you so interested?\u201d\nA crease appeared between Malfoy\u2019s eyebrows and he gestured with one hand. \u201cI felt\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIf it\u2019s not my business what you feel, it\u2019s not yours what I do,\u201d Harry muttered, flushing for the thousandth time in thirty minutes. He jerked his head toward the bed. \u201cLet\u2019s just get in.\u201d\nMalfoy's face tensed, his shoulders coming up. They moved in tandem, climbing into the bed from the foot of it and crawling up to the pillows. After slipping under the covers, Harry cast a quick, wordless Nox and felt Malfoy\u2019s surprised intake of breath. There was a heavy pause, and then Malfoy murmured, \u201cYou can do wordless, wandless magic?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yeah. For some stuff. Basic spells. I\u2019ve only done the more complicated ones accidentally,\u201d Harry said, feeling more comfortable with the light out, even though he was still too aware of Malfoy, just inches away from him.\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 uncommon. For most wizards.\u201d\n\u201cDo you know any?\u201d Harry asked without thinking. It was strange how it seemed, in the dark, they were able to have an almost a normal conversation.\n\u201cI can do some wordless and some wandless, but I haven\u2019t done both at the same time,\u201d Malfoy admitted, somewhat stiffly. His disembodied voice took on a sneering quality. \u201cI guess you\u2019re just good at everything aren\u2019t you?\u201d\nHarry\u2019s hands closed in frustration. He ached to give Malfoy a sharp fist to the nose to repay him for the train in sixth year, but he knew it would only lead to more trouble. Even just the tension brought on by Malfoy\u2019s words had an unpleasant effect on Harry\u2019s chest; his fingers twitched and his legs jerked uneasily from it. He rolled to his side, tugging the blankets with him to more securely warm himself and smiled meanly when Malfoy gave an offended yelp and tugged them back. Harry let go of the extra he had taken and felt Malfoy settle back against his pillows with a huff.\nHe couldn\u2019t figure Malfoy out. His mind returned to the simple letter he had received from him early in the summer after the trials, thanking Harry for speaking up for his mother (and himself, although he neglected to write that part), and for the return of his wand, which Harry had shoved into his hands as he walked out of Wizengamot after being declared free on probation. He remembered Malfoy\u2019s startled expression, that split second of shining joy on his face, which had grown much thinner while he waited for his trial. The letter wasn\u2019t detailed and didn\u2019t ask for a response, but Harry had opened and reopened it in the weeks following to look at the precise, flowing script of it and be surprised anew at the kind, grateful simplicity of its contents.\nHe\u2019d thought\u2026 Fuck, he didn\u2019t know what he thought. He thought, for the first time, that maybe he and Malfoy could have been friends if their families had been different, if their destinies had led them down alternate paths. He\u2019d wondered what would have changed if he had tried being nice to Malfoy in first year, maybe hadn\u2019t turned up his nose at that handshake, while still figuring out a way to defend his friends from Malfoy\u2019s inherent snobbery.\nUpon coming back for eighth year, Harry had searched for Malfoy, picking out the highlights of his pale hair across the Great Hall and expecting Malfoy to respond well to his friendly smile -- which, of course, he hadn\u2019t. He\u2019d sneered, like always, and Harry had felt like an idiot. The idiocy he could cope with (he had a lot of practice) but the weird sense of\u2026 disappointment that had accompanied Malfoy\u2019s sneer had been something else entirely.\n\u201cMalfoy?\u201d\nMalfoy\u2019s voice was rough, on the verge of sleep. \u201cMm, what is it now, Potter?\u201d\nHarry wasn\u2019t sure. Out of the thousands of things he wanted to say, he finally picked out, \u201cNothing. Just wondering if you were asleep yet.\u201d\nMalfoy\u2019s voice grew slightly sharper. \u201cI almost was, you annoying tit. Now shut it.\u201d\nHarry did. He willed his thoughts to Quidditch, replaying the most recent match he had attended in his head. Soon enough, Malfoy\u2019s breath turned deep and even, and Harry rolled back over to face him. He studied Malfoy's relaxed features in the shadows, which were strangely beautiful in repose. Malfoy\u2019s face had filled out some and he\u2019d lost the pinched, pointy look that Harry had long associated with him. His nose was long and straight, his cheekbones high and elegant, and his chin \u2014 well, yeah, was still a bit pointy. His hair fanned the pillow it rested on. Harry turned onto his back again and stared at the bed hangings in the dark.\nSleep, as it turned out, would not come for a long time.\nUnlike the previous evening in the medical wing, consciousness returned to Harry with a snap the next morning. He had been having a delicious dream about staring out at the beach, bare feet in sand when, suddenly, he was back in his bed, with an armful of Malfoy.\nAlthough armful wasn\u2019t quite right, Harry thought, his jumbled thoughts clearing as he woke. Malfoy was more draped across Harry, boneless in sleep. His chest covered Harry\u2019s and his face pressed into the crook of Harry\u2019s neck, his hair falling in Harry\u2019s face. Oh. That was the beachy, coconut smell. Harry could feel Malfoy\u2019s warm breath puff against his skin with every exhale.\nNot quite sure what to do, Harry stayed still. One of his arms had actually come up to wrap around Malfoy\u2019s shoulders in the night and he removed it carefully. Fortunately, his hips were free because wouldn\u2019t that be awkward. Like any of the rest of this is bloody normal, he thought, irritated with himself. But it wasn\u2019t really his fault, he reasoned -- he was a normal, eighteen-year-old boy and waking up with Malfoy on top of him had nothing, nothing, to do with his... usual morning problem, which was tenting his flannel bottoms quite insistently.\nOn the rare occasion it went away completely by itself, but usually Harry had a good morning wank in the shower to take care of it. He sighed, nibbling on his lip. Obviously that wasn\u2019t going to happen today. He used his free hand to adjust it to a less obvious position and grabbed a handful of covers that had fallen off him in the night to flop them over his groin.\nMalfoy was still out cold. Harry took a moment to see if he could still feel Malfoy's magic. He closed his eyes and focused on the sensation in his midsection.\nYes, there. The link was still strong \u2014 stronger than the previous day \u2014 but for the moment, Malfoy\u2019s magic seemed calm. Peaceful and... rather lovely. Like a placid lake with a surface that had been warmed by the sun or the gentle lap of waves on a beach. Harry felt settled by it, by the way it almost seemed to glow inside of him. He finally understood what Hermione said when she had told him that they had been bathed in light.\nHis problem wasn\u2019t going away. If anything, focusing on Malfoy\u2019s magic and the link between them had made it more pressing. Harry shifted his hips uneasily, trying to scoot away, and got a sleepily murmured protest for his efforts.\nHe cleared his throat. \u201cMalfoy,\u201d he said, voice low.\nSlumberous, smoky eyes fluttered, blinking up at him. There was a crease on one of Malfoy\u2019s cheeks, from the sheets or pillow, although Harry couldn\u2019t quite figure out because apparently, he\u2019d been Malfoy\u2019s pillow. Malfoy looked up at him, sleep-warmed and relaxed, completely unguarded for once. Harry had time for a single thought, oh, shit, before he saw the click of understanding on Malfoy\u2019s face. His eyes widened and pupils dilated and he sprang away from Harry, tangled in the sheets, to stared across the length of the bed, panting. They both froze at the same time. The distance between them felt like a rope made of razors, pulling at Harry\u2019s insides. Their link gave a sharp, wrenching twist and Malfoy voiced a guttural little mew before moving back closer until the pain eased off.\n\u201cWhat the fuck were you doing, Potter?\u201d Malfoy finally got out, voice scandalized.\nHarry couldn\u2019t resist a grin. He still hadn\u2019t moved an inch from where he had been. \u201cActing as your mattress, I guess,\u201d he said, raising his eyebrows.\nMalfoy glared at him and sniffed. \u201cAs if I would ever expose myself to secondhand furniture. Merlin, what are you even wearing?\u201d\nHarry glanced down at his worn shirt. There was some loose threading at the hem, a hole in the shoulder seam, and it had been cleaned so often that the Canons emblem was practically worn off, but was all the more comfortable for its age. \u201cMy pyjamas. I was wearing them last night,\u201d he pointed out.\n\u201cI must\u2019ve been too traumatized by the thought of having to sleep next to you to notice,\u201d Malfoy grumbled.\n\u201cI guess you got over that,\u201d Harry said with a snicker. Malfoy\u2019s eyes darted up to his and Harry gave a toothy grin at the pink stain spreading ovet Malfoy's cheeks.\n\u201cIt must have been the spell,\u201d Malfoy mumbled resentfully. \u201cOr you did something.\u201d\nHarry shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s me, Defeater of Dark Lords and nefarious caster of spells that get people to drool on me in their sleep.\u201d He wiped his neck for effect.\nMalfoy rolled his eyes. \u201cWhy am I not surprised. Not enough that they drool on you during all of your waking hours, I suppose?\u201d\nHarry gave a startled laugh. He was pretty sure Malfoy had meant that in a mean way, but there was a lot of truth to his snark. \u201cI guess not.\u201d\nMalfoy\u2019s posture relaxed a little and they sat for a moment in bed, staring at each other. Finally, Malfoy broke their gaze by glancing at the loo in a way that reminded Harry of both the pressure on his bladder and the other\u2026 pressing issue. Fuck. \nThey clambered off the bed in unison and made way for the bathroom. Using the previous night as a template, they stood back to back while each of them took care of their needs. Harry\u2019s problem faded a bit, thankfully.\nWhen he was finished with his turn, he looked over to see Malfoy gnawing on his slender lower lip and staring at the shower stall. Harry\u2019s humour of the morning faltered a bit. The stall was more than wide enough for two people, but that wouldn\u2019t matter when they would need to be near-touching for the whole thing.\n\u201cWe could, er, cast a cleaning charm,\u201d Harry offered quietly.\nMalfoy\u2019s nose wrinkled in disgust. He gave Harry such a fussy, distressed look that Harry actually felt bad for a minute. Malfoy sighed. \"We can\u2019t cast on ourselves yet. Besides, cleaning charms are superficial. I actually prefer to shower at night, and now it\u2019s been over a day.\u201d\n\u201cI offered!\u201d Harry said. Malfoy shook his head silently, still staring at the stall.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll just do it fast,\" he said.\nWith determination equal to that of a Gryffindor, Malfoy strode forward. Harry followed, lingering awkwardly and fiddling with the plush towels hanging by the shower door as Malfoy reached in to turn on the spray and adjust the temperature. Malfoy glanced at him and half turned, fingers dancing down the buttons of his nightshirt and Harry reluctantly began disrobing as well. They made short work of undressing, studiously not looking at each other. Malfoy stepped into the shower and Harry did likewise.\nMalfoy took the first spot under the spray, the extra water bouncing off him and hitting Harry on the shoulder and in the side of his face. Harry hissed.\n\u201cFuck, Malfoy, that\u2019s freezing!\u201d\n\u201cI like it that way,\u201d Malfoy snapped, facing away.\nHarry shivered while he waited, hopping lightly in place to keep his teeth from chattering. Malfoy soaped up and rinsed off quickly, then used two different hair potions, Harry saw from his periphery.\nThat wasn\u2019t all he could see. Down, shifting occasionally with Malfoy\u2019s movements, was the round curve of Malfoy's pale backside \u2014 not actually bony, at all, as it turned out. Harry made an effort not to stare, but it kept drawing his attention like a lodestone. He closed his eyes completely and focused on the freezing water spraying the right half of his body. Malfoy suddenly elbowed him and Harry grunted, opening his eyes. He ticked a glance \u2014 keeping his eyes up \u2014 to Malfoy\u2019s face, which looked irritated and as cold as Harry was. Merlin, his lips were even turning blue.\n\u201cYour turn,\" Malfoy said, training his eyes on the stall door.\nHarry stepped under the spray, resolutely not adjusting the cold water, which it was actually helping his morning problem quite a bit. He washed himself quickly, rubbing a rough washcloth over his bits and under his arms, and grabbed one of the shampoos Malfoy had left on the shelf -- if Malfoy got pissed, all the better. He scrubbed his head, rinsed, and turned off the water as fast as he could, ignoring the occasional brush of wet skin-on-skin he felt whenever he moved.\nMalfoy grabbed a towel for himself and wordlessly handed over the other. Harry took it, grateful to cover up for a moment. They brushed their teeth like that, side by side, staring into the mirror with towels wrapped around their waists. Then Malfoy began a weird ritual of grooming that rather fascinated Harry, not that he would ever admit it.\nFirst, Malfoy began with some sort of cream, which he rubbed thoroughly into his skin. Following this, he applied two more hair potions. The last step, it seemed, was to stroke his hair with a fine-toothed comb that had a mother-of-pearl handle and appeared to have inlaid drying charms. Harry stopped watching. He didn\u2019t know whether to be embarrassed that it took him twenty seconds to comb his own hair, or annoyed that it seemed to take Malfoy an hour.\nTo distract himself, he closed his eyes again and found the link between them. It was there, a glowing little knot of two different forces wound around each other. Malfoy\u2019s grooming routine seemed to have a calming effect on both of their cores.\nHarry stopped, struck at the realization that he could so closely identify the tangled mess linking their magic. Tentatively, visualizing it as just that \u2014 a link \u2014 he gave it an internal nudge. A soft gust of air that edged on a whine escaped Malfoy\u2019s throat and Harry opened his eyes to find Malfoy staring at him in shock.\n\u201cDid you do that?\u201d\nHarry nodded, throat throat working. Whatever he had done had felt\u2026 good, though strange and perplexing. At least, to him.\n\u201cYeah. I was just\u2026 experimenting.\u201d\n\u201cGo experiment with someone else,\u201d Malfoy snipped, looking at Harry distrustfully in the mirror.\nThe calming glow of the link had ceased, replaced by a frantic little thumpthumpthump, like the throb of a panicked heart. Harry bit his lip, resolving to talk to Highlash about it.\n***\nBreakfast was as bad as dinner had been.\nWithout warning or prior discussion, Malfoy marched to the Slytherin table and sat down on the bench hard, outside Parkinson and Zabini. It gave Harry no choice but to follow, only to be quite thoroughly ignored. Harry caught sight of Ron's outraged face from across the Hall and gave a helpless shrug.\nHe sighed and began filling his plate with nearby sausages and toast. He reached over Malfoy to grab the eggs, purposely bumping Malfoy\u2019s arm and smiling vacantly when it caused Malfoy to spill his food. It earned him a glare from Malfoy and, surpisingly delighted smirks from Parkinson and Zabini. But when no one engaged with him, Harry set to work on his food, deliberately attempting to eat with more reticence. So his table manners might be a little lacking for a pure-blood snob like Malfoy; so what? He ignored the little voice in his head reminding him of Malfoy\u2019s insult from dinnertime -- it certainly wasn\u2019t his fault that he\u2019d been half-starved growing up and enjoyed food whenever he could now.\nHe ate diligently and carefully, as happy to tune out the conversation going on next to him as the people having it obviously were for him not to hear. Still, snippets kept bleeding into his ears. \u201c\u2026thing you thought it would be?\u201d Zabini murmured at one point, and Malfoy rumbled a hushed, angry response.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, darling, you\u2019re not going to\u2026 although, I\u2019m not convinced he\u2019s not actually a\u2026\u201d Parkinson whispered, and Malfoy's loud hiss cut her off.\nIt went on like that for a bit and Harry was on his second cup of coffee \u2014 something he\u2019d recently discovered wasn\u2019t at all atrocious when you added enough cream and sugar \u2014 before the sneaky bastards were done talking. He looked down at his plate with a little regret at not finishing everything there but, well, at least Malfoy would have no cause to insult him about his eating habits again. Probably.\n***\nHarry and Malfoy waited in an empty classroom for Professor Highlash to show up. McGonagall had informed them of the time and place during Advanced Transfigurations which had, all things considered, not gone nearly as badly has Harry had expected.\nFor one thing, Malfoy was bloody talented at Transfiguration, Harry had to admit, as good as Harry himself. He knew Malfoy was a better student overall, but Harry had taken a not-insignificant amount of satisfaction in keeping up with him. He even managed to fully Transfigure a live bird in a cage into a fish in a bowl, whereas Malfoy\u2019s fish still had a feather attached to one fin (something he attributed, in a grumble, to being distracted by Harry\u2019s magic).\nOther than that, it had been rather heavy on lecture and light on the spellwork, as classes went, probably out of deference to their problem, but Harry walked away feeling as though it had gone rather decently. If one could define \"decently\" as he and Malfoy managing to not kill each other.\nFollowing that, they had eaten lunch \u2014 this time at the Gryffindor table (Harry employed Malfoy\u2019s not-bothering-to-ask approach), and he\u2019d gotten to talk to Ron as well as Hermione, who had already found eight thick tombs on the theory of magical cores, and was researching for medical cases similar to theirs, though she hadn\u2019t found them yet. Harry had listened, trying not to let his eyes glaze over as obviously as Ron\u2019s, when Malfoy had interrupted her steady string of words.\n\u201cBloodwork,\u201d he\u2019d said suddenly, jerking Harry\u2019s attention back to the conversation.\nHermione had paused. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n\u201cYou mentioned yesterday that the magical signature is found in the blood. Potions used on Wizards interact with the blood; almost all of them have traces of iron or something with an iron base to allow for easier and quicker absorption into the blood,\u201d Malfoy explained, leaning toward Hermione and lowering his voice. His shoulder brushed against Harry\u2019s, causing an odd little flip in Harry\u2019s midsection that had nothing to do with their link. \u201cI mean, there are a certain few that interact with stomach acid, but even those are eventually absorbed into the blood flow. You should cross-reference any spells that do, as well.\u201d\nHarry exchanged a startled glance with Ron before looking at Hermione, whose eyes were suddenly bright. \u201cBecause spells can affect only part or all of the wizard,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cLike glamour spells and warming charms.\u201d\nMalfoy nodded with satisfaction. \u201cYes. Which is what Smith\u2019s should have done. His hex was meant to bind my mouth closed. Obviously, it affected something in our blood too, which is odd, but also telling. If you insist on researching this, you should be cross-checking medical records with potions or spells that had an immediate effect on the blood content of the wizards.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 That\u2019s rather brilliant, Malfoy,\u201d Hermione said with a wide smile. \u201cThank you, that should narrow my search quite a lot.\u201d\nHarry could swear he saw colour rising in Malfoy\u2019s pale cheeks and he felt something akin to satisfaction inside \u2014 definitely not his \u2014 as Malfoy waved a vague hand at her and hesitated. \u201cIf you find yourself in need of help\u2026\u201d\nRon\u2019s eyebrows skyrocketed and he choked on his food, but Hermione simply smiled again and nodded. \u201cYou would do that?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind research,\u201d Malfoy mumbled. With a sneer he'd added, \u201cAnd I want to get rid of him as soon as possible, of course.\u201d\nHermione sighed. \u201cOf course.\u201d\nAfter lunch had been Advanced Potions, in which Slughorn had been delighted by their pairing. Slughorn had been vaguely disappointed by the lack of potions intuition Harry had shown back in sixth year, but Harry had been applying himself diligently since the beginning of term and, without Snape there constantly making him feel like an idiot, he\u2019d improved quite a bit on his own. Potions was one of the most important N.E.W.T.\u2019s for a potential Auror to pass, as many of their investigations had to do with being able to identify or craft them. And he had gotten much better, there was no doubt about that \u2014 a lot of it had to do with actually listening and taking notes, he\u2019d found \u2014 but Malfoy\u2026 Well, Malfoy was simply brilliant with them.\nThey had been assigned a rather complicated potion designed to make the consumer feel euphoria for an extended length of time. When Harry had accidentally reached for the gold flakes instead of the gold shreds, Malfoy had stopped him with a quiet hand over his, gesturing to the right bottle without a word. It happened again when Harry had taken a silver knife to cut the Campion petal; Malfoy simply tugged the knife away and murmured, \u201cTearing it into small pieces with your fingers works better.\u201d\nTheir potion had turned out perfectly, much to the delight of both Harry and Slughorn, who had awarded each of their Houses twenty points.\nIn truth, though, Harry had been most impressed by the quiet competence of Malfoy while working together. When once he would have done anything he could to make Harry look stupid -- even at the risk of his own grade -- today he had efficiently and generously lent his knowledge to Harry in a way that made it possible for them both to benefit.\nIt made Harry almost\u2026 admire him. When Malfoy wasn\u2019t being an arse.\nWhich was a different problem, altogether.\nHighlash finally bustled in, carrying a pile of books and parchment and tearing Harry out of his reverie. He placed his armful on a nearby desk and leaned on it, scrutinizing Harry and Malfoy in a way that made Harry slightly uncomfortable.\n\u201cAll right,\u201d he said finally. \u201cWe\u2019re going to begin with some mental exercises, and I have some for you to work on whenever you have a free period and I\u2019m not able to assist. Do either of you have any questions, first?\u201d\nHarry had plenty, but he was surprised to hear Malfoy speak up first. \u201cWe can\u2019t spell each other or ourselves.\u201d\nHighlash nodded. \u201cThat will come, once you\u2019ve learned how to utilize the other\u2019s core in tandem with your own.\u201d\n\u201cBut we can work other spells,\u201d Harry pointed out, confused. \u201cWhy can we do those, and not others?\u201d\n\u201cThey cause each of you some discomfort, though, when the other casts a spell?\u201d Highlash guessed. They nodded and Highlash clicked his tongue. \u201cHave either of you ever heard of the Devil\u2019s Snare?\u201d\nHarry huffed out a soft chuckle and nodded again, earning him a strange look from both Malfoy and Highlash. After a second, Malfoy nodded too. Highlash continued, \u201cThink of it this way: Anyone unfortunate enough to be caught in it will automatically resist. It\u2019s what we do, as humans. We don\u2019t like to feel trapped. But doing so causes a reaction in the plant \u2014 it holds you tighter. It\u2019s only when you relax your body that the snare releases its hold. In much the same way, whenever you cast \u2014 which is important to keep doing, understand \u2014 the part of your core entwined with another, foreign being, will tighten against the resistance. Once you each learn to work together, to cast together, your cores will relax, and should start responding positively to the other, as an extension of themselves, rather than as intruders they need to fight. t\u2019s a rather intimate thing, I would expect. It might take some time, as I\u2019m aware the two of you are not what most people would call\u2026 friendly.\u201d\nHarry saw Malfoy\u2019s mouth drop open.\n\u201cNo, sir,\u201d Harry said, too-seriously. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been.\u201d\n\u201cWell, you\u2019ll need to work on that. Trust is key,\u201d Highlash said briskly. \u201cNow, then. We\u2019ll be working on isolating the feeling of your individual magic so that you\u2019ll have an easier time separating it, if it comes to that. How much of the lecture do either of you remember?\u201d\n\u201cYou were telling us to visualize our core as the Elements,\u201d Malfoy said promptly. Harry didn\u2019t remember that part but he bobbed his head anyway.\n\u201cYes. All right, as I said, magical energy comes from four of the five elements, Fire, Wind, Water, and Earth; however, there is usually one dominant element in each wizard\u2019s core that is utilized,\u201d the professor said. \u201cI\u2019d like you to close your eyes and search for the connection between you. How easily can you identify it?\u201d\nHarry closed his eyes, focusing, and there it was, pulsing between them. \u201cVery, sir,\u201d he said quietly.\nMalfoy made a little noise in the back of his throat. \u201cYes.\u201d\nHighlash \u201cmmm\u201dd thoughtfully. \u201cCan each of you discern which is yours and which belongs to the other?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s also pretty easy,\u201d Harry said, still examining it in his mind. \u201cI mean, there are places in the link that are tangled and I lose sight of what\u2019s his and what\u2019s mine, but for the most part\u2026\u201d\n\u201cA link. Very good way to describe it, Mr. Potter,\u201d Highlash murmured.\n\u201cI can, too,\u201d Malfoy said after a moment\u2019s hesitation. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t seem as easy as he\u2019s describing. It\u2019s\u2026 bright.\u201d\n\u201cAll right, that\u2019s fine,\" Highlash said. \"Now. Would either of you be able to tell me what the other\u2019s primary element is?\u201d\n\u201cWater and air,\u201d Harry said instantly, the words tumbling out. He opened his eyes, a bit startled, but recognized the truth of it without bothering to examine the tangle of their cores. Whenever he thought of Malfoy\u2019s in any comparative terms, it was always in some form of water or air.\nMalfoy was looking at him, eyes wide. Harry shrugged, a little uncomfortably. Malfoy pursed his lips. \u201cNice of you to pay so much attention to me, Potter,\u201d he mumbled out of the side of his mouth.\n\u201cI can\u2019t help it, you wanker, you\u2019re inside me,\u201d Harry shot back angrily. His words were still echoing in his ears when the double meaning hit him and his face flamed.\nMalfoy snickered. \u201cYou wish, Potter.\u201d\n\u201cAll right, both of you, stop it,\u201d Highlash said with an exasperated sigh. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I can make it clearer to either of you the importance of working together. Mr. Malfoy, can you identify Mr. Potter\u2019s element?\u201d\nMalfoy closed his eyes again for a long moment, and Harry studied him curiously. \u201cFire,\u201d Malfoy said at length. Harry didn\u2019t know why he was surprised. He\u2019d thought to hear Malfoy say Air -- maybe because of Quidditch. Malfoy paused. Then, more tentatively, \u201cBut\u2026 I think, Earth, too?\u201d\n\u201cReally? Interesting!\u201d Highlash said, moving closer. He absentmindedly scratched at his beard as he studied Harry \u2014 again, Harry felt that waver of discomfort at the scrutiny. \u201cDual primary elements happen, of course, but they\u2019re certainly not common. And to find them in two people who have been Bound\u2026 Mr. Malfoy, can you describe why you feel that way?\u201d\nMalfoy flushed slightly, and Harry was so intrigued by the colour in Malfoy's cheeks, he almost forgot to listen to his answer. \u201cIt...burns,\" Malfoy said, not looking at him. \"It surges and fades. But there\u2019s something about the replenishment of it that feels\u2026 Healthy.\u201d\n\u201cVery interesting!\u201d Highlash murmured. \u201cAnd Mr. Potter, you? How have you seen his?\u201d\n\u201cRain. A lake. Ocean waves, calm ones, before he woke up this morning. Once, when it first happened, I thought of wind. And I keep picturing storms,\u201d Harry supplied slowly.\n\u201cVery definitely water and air,\u201d Highlash confirmed. \u201cWell, it\u2019s obviously proceeded much further than I thought possible in a single day if you two have already been able to visualize each other\u2019s Elements. Tell me, can you influence the link at all?\u201d\n\u201cHe can,\u201d Malfoy said quietly. \u201cI haven\u2019t tried.\u201d\n\u201cTry,\u201d the professor urged, looking entirely too fascinated.\nMalfoy huffed softly and closed his eyes again. Harry waited and, after a moment, felt a strange, tiny ping inside, like the vibration of a bell.\n\u201cI felt that.\u201d He turned back to the Highlash, who was watching them with an odd little smile. \u201cThat reminds me, Professor. We\u2019ve also been able to\u2026 Sense each other\u2019s \u2014 I guess, emotions? A few times. Is that normal?\u201d\nHighlash had the audacity to laugh. \u201cNone of this is what I would call normal, but that, at least, is hardly surprising. The link is going to grow and expand in different ways. Your individual cores are very likely experiencing a lot of negative impact, particularly as you two are not\u2026 inclined\u2026 toward friendship. The link is making you listen to each other so that your cores aren\u2019t damaged.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know all of this, Sir?\u201d Malfoy asked abruptly. \u201cA friend of ours said that Magical Cores is a highly under-researched area and that hypotheses abound on the subject.\u201d\nHarry goggled at him briefly, almost too distracted by hearing Malfoy describe Hermione as a \u201cfriend of ours,\u201d to process Malfoy\u2019s actual question. Once it penetrated, he turned to the Professor with interest.\nHighlash\u2019s expression lost its humour. \u201cI\u2019ve been the leading expert on Magical Core Theory for the whole of my career, young man. Most of the books you read -- at least, the ones which have been written in the last few decades -- will either have been written by me or have me quoted in the text. Furthermore, I worked in Magical Research at the Ministry for my first ten years out of Hogwarts.\u201d\n\u201cOf course, Sir,\u201d Harry said, words stumbling. What had just happened? \u201cIt\u2019s good to know we\u2019re in the hands of an expert.\u201d\nHighlash\u2019s face softened. \u201cI understand. This is all academic to me and you two are the one having to deal with the effects of it. Of course you should be interested in my knowledge of the subject.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cNow, then, I\u2019m going to be assigning you some exercises to do tonight and anytime you have a free period\u2026\u201d\nHarry turned his ear to listening, but half of his mind remained on Malfoy -- and the roar of the river he could hear inside of himself.\n***\n\u201cAll right, do you want to tell me what that was about, with Highlash?\u201d Harry asked.\nHe had tried to bring it up at dinner \u2014 at the Slytherin table \u2014 and had been silenced by a swift shake of Malfoy\u2019s head. When Parkinson had leaned forward with gleaming eyes, demanding to know what he was talking about, Harry had understood why.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry your pretty tits over it, Pans,\u201d Malfoy had said lightly, making her laugh, though Harry felt a quick unpleasant thrill over the interaction. It was true that Parkinson did have very nice tits, if one were inclined that way, Harry thought sullenly, eating his dinner as Malfoy began another whispered conversation with his friends. He wondered if Malfoy was still dating her. They were together all the time, obviously, but Malfoy didn\u2019t seem especially nice to her \u2014 not that Harry saw him being especially nice to anyone, really.\nMaybe it was a Slytherin thing.\nAfter dinner, Hermione had wrangled an invite for herself and Ron up to their rooms, where he and Malfoy had wedged themselves together on the loveseat. Ron had levitated the chess table over to them and begun a game with Harry while Hermione had sat on the floor in front of them and talked concepts with Malfoy. Never good at chess, Harry played with an ear toward Hermione and Malfoy\u2019s conversation, the rest of his mind wandering. At one point Harry's ears perked up when Malfoy had asked, \u201cIs Professor Highlash quoted in any of those books?\u201d\n\"Oh yes,\u201d Hermione said blithely. \u201cI was only able to locate one of the ones he\u2019s written, but I think there are two more. He\u2019s probably the most knowledgeable wizard in Britain on the subject of Magical Theory and most of his research was done on Magical Cores. Like I said, though, much of it is hypothesis, as there isn't any safe way to really test the magical core \u2014 or at least, not any way to recreate tests. But he\u2019s very smart.\u201d\n\u201cPotter, you\u2019re three moves from checkmating the Weasel,\u201d Malfoy said out of nowhere. Harry looked down at the board and then up at Ron\u2019s horrified face.\n\u201cI am?\u201d\n\u201cYou are not!\u201d Ron said, affronted.\nMalfoy snorted. \u201cWhy am I not surprised that you didn\u2019t know? Check your knight.\u201d\n\u201cMalfoy,\u201d Ron growled warningly.\nMalfoy looked at him for a moment before throwing his head back on a laugh like Harry had never heard from him before. Straight white teeth flashed and the constant tension in the slant of his mouth eased as Malfoy smiled. \u201cIf you ever have enough courage to play someone you can\u2019t beat with your eyes closed, Owl me,\u201d he said, still chuckling.\n\u201cI mostly play Harry for practice,\u201d Ron grumbled. Harry glared took his queen, positioning for his first chess win against Ron in seven years. Malfoy had laughed again and Hermione joined in.\nDespite the euphoric \u2014 if somewhat stolen \u2014 victory of the night, Malfoy\u2019s odd behavior kept returning to him. They\u2019d worked on their homework (eighteen inches on Transfiguring live creatures and twelve on the differences between mood potions and love potions) and had taken another, even more awkward visit to the bathroom before sharing another freezing shower. They were lying in bed when Harry remembered to ask about it.\nHe felt Malfoy shift next to him. There was a long silence. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I felt like he was more interested in learning about us than treating us.\u201d\nHarry had felt that way, too, although he hadn\u2019t realized it until Malfoy said so. He exhaled, thinking. \u201cWell, maybe. But even if he was, he\u2019s still treating us, so it\u2019s all the same, right?\u201d\n\u201cI suppose,\u201d Malfoy said grudgingly. \u201cNot that you\u2019d ever expect a teacher to turn down helping you, Potter.\u201d\nHarry sat up in bed, suddenly bubbling with frustration. It skimmed through his body like a physical entity. The connection between them heightened, bordering on pain, but Harry ignored it. It really, really sucked that they couldn\u2019t just fight, Harry thought with some desperation.\n\u201cMerlin, what is with you, Malfoy?\u201d he demanded. \u201cI try to be nice and you\u2019re an arse. I try to ignore that you\u2019re a arse and you become an even bigger one. I actually start to feel that you might be a bit decent and then out of nowhere you become you again!\u201d\n\u201cI never claimed to be decent,\u201d Malfoy drawled evenly.\n\u201cWhat was that with helping me with chess tonight? And why are you working with Hermione?\u201d\nMalfoy gave an exaggerated yawn. \u201cI play chess. I simply noticed. Who I hate more has always been a toss-up between you and the Weasel,\u201d he said nastily. \u201cTonight I just figured it would bother him more to lose; you seemed quite used to it.\n\u201cAs for Granger, as I told her, I want out of this situation as quickly as possible and she does seem to have some good ideas,\u201d he continued. \u201cEven if she is a Mu\u2014\u201c\n\u201cSay it and I\u2019ll hex you, I fucking swear,\u201d Harry said dangerously, palming his wand. \u201cI don\u2019t care what the repercussions are, I really don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cI was going to say \u2018Muggle-Born,\u2019\u201d Malfoy sniggered. \u201cBut my, my. It\u2019s not as if I\u2019ve insulted your precious girlfriend. Although \u2014 maybe there\u2019s more there than most people know? Does the Girl Weasel know how to share? She doesn\u2019t seem the type\u2026\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s not,\u201d Harry said curtly. He forced himself to loosen his grip on his wand. \u201cThat\u2019s why Dean never looks at another girl, for fear that Gin will hex his bollocks off.\u201d\nThere was a heavy, extended pause. It seemed to stretch like elastic, growing tighter and tighter in the silence, and Harry waited with a gnawing feeling for the snap.\nTo his surprise, when Malfoy finally spoke again, his voice was quiet. \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware. I thought you two were supposed to get married or something.\u201d\n\u201cThe war changed things,\u201d Harry said, suddenly weary. \u201cNot that it\u2019s any of your business.\u201d\n\u201cI felt your... affection for her.\u201d\n\u201cI feel affection for her, you idiot,\u201d Harry muttered. \u201cThere are lots of different types of affection, in case you didn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s the Greengrass girl?\u201d Harry challenged back, staring at Malfoy in the darkness.\nHis face shuttered. \u201cFuck off, Potter.\u201d\n\u201cJust stop it!\u201d Harry shouted, goaded. \u201cLook, I got your letter. I got it. I know you\u2019re not always like this. And you owe me a little\u2014\u201c\n\u201cWhat,\u201d Malfoy said when Harry broke off, his voice going low and cutting, \u201cis it that I owe you? Why don\u2019t you tell me, exactly? A life-debt? Of course. Feel free to take it whenever you want. I\u2019m not able to do much with mine anymore, anyway. Or do you want something more base than that? Just want to see me humiliated? Do you like looking at me across the hall and knowing I could be your house-elf? I'll bet you just love knowing you could have anything, anything you wanted from me with the snap of your fingers, don\u2019t you?\u201d\nHarry\u2019s heart stuttered frantically. Merlin, the images that conjured. He was slightly ashamed of how quickly his body reacted, how quickly his imagination kicked into overdrive.\nMalfoy\u2019s face was pinched and tight, covered in shadows that had nothing to do with the dark of the evening. His eyes were glassy, reflecting moonlight. Harry\u2019s breath caught, and he felt a warm tingling begin in their link. It started where their cores were joined and radiated out in a flush that spread over Harry\u2019s entire body. His cheeks grew hot and he closed his eyes as a wave of liquid want streaked through him. His cock began to thicken.\nMalfoy propped himself up on an elbow. His face had lost its tension, becoming soft and filled with something that looked like astonishment. He reached out a tentative hand and touched Harry on the wrist with two fingers. Harry almost groaned out loud at the amount of pleasure that Malfoy's skin on his wrenched from him.\n\u201cWhat do you want from me, Potter?\u201d Malfoy asked again, the question quieter and heavy, laced with something Harry didn\u2019t understand \u2014 or couldn\u2019t bring himself identify.\nHarry fought for control. That heat that flowed so effortlessly through him dominated his thoughts, but he forced it aside to assess Malfoy, who was looking at him with what seemed to be the same desire Harry felt, although it had to \u2014 almost certainly \u2014 come from the link.\n\u201cCommon courtesy,\u201d Harry said in a low voice, because it was what he had been going to say before Malfoy\u2019s outburst.\nBecause it was the truth.\nJust not all of it.\nBecause while he had, in his smallest and meanest moments -- those moments he wouldn\u2019t admit even to Ron -- contemplated what Malfoy owed him, Harry knew he could never take something offered because of those debts. Could never take something given because it was his right to collect, no matter how much he wanted.\nFor a minute, he hated himself for it.\nMalfoy\u2019s face, so open and almost hopeful only seconds ago, sharpened and shuttered. He drew his hand away, and laid back down before rolling away so Harry found himself staring at Malfoy's back.\n\u201cThat\u2019s reasonable,\u201d Malfoy said in a muffled voice after a few moments. \u201cGood night, Potter. Sleep well.\u201d\nHarry\u2019s blood was still pulsing through him. He reached out a hand, stopping just before he could skate his fingers over the slide of those silver pajamas. He laid down as well, stuffing his wand back under his pillow, and closed his eyes tightly.\nAsking Malfoy to be courteous to him, Harry thought the next day, was possibly the stupidest thing he had ever done.\nBecause he was. Malfoy was just so goddamn courteous.\nThey woke up much as they had the previous morning, Malfoy\u2019s body snuggled tight against Harry\u2019s side, one long, muscular thigh thrown over Harry\u2019s legs. He wondered momentarily if Malfoy had owned a giant teddy bear growing up, or if he was just a heat-seeker in his sleep. Not that their room was cold. In fact, the longer Harry stayed in Malfoy\u2019s relaxed embrace, the warmer he began to feel. And his problem was back, apparently loving the pressure of Malfoy\u2019s leg on top of it.\u00a0 It took all of Harry\u2019s control to not flex his hips upwards.\nDisgusted with himself, he muttered to his erection, \u201cCan\u2019t you give me a break for a single morning?\u201d\n\u201cWha--?\u201d Malfoy mumbled.\u00a0 His leg shifted and Harry bit back a groan.\nHe was sorely tempted to go with it. It would be so easy -- he could tighten his arms just a little, could nuzzle his nose into the soft, white-blond hair fanning over his face. Could roll his hips up against Malfoy, checking for a response. He could simply blurt out the truth of his ill-advised attraction and maybe try for a kiss, if he felt just a mote less worried that Malfoy would automatically shove him five feet away, possibly killing them both on the spot.\nUntil the previous night, it hadn\u2019t occurred to Harry that Malfoy might be inclined toward, well. Harry had been vaguely aware of his own interest in blokes but it hadn\u2019t really mattered to him. Not until after the thing with Ginny had really ended and he had been left at loose ends with all of the roads in his life suddenly open and unmarked and filled with wonderful, terrifying possibility.\nHe Accio\u2019d his glasses and shoved them on, looking down at Malfoy\u2019s face. Keeping his eyes trained on the curve of Malfoy\u2019s jaw, the delicate shell of his ear, Harry searched again for their link, wondering if he could sense anything more than surface feelings.\nAll was calm inside of them again. Malfoy\u2019s face faded out of focus as Harry stared. Images of loose, floating white feathers filled his vision, Harry slipping into a languid sort of trance. The feathers swirled in a neat pattern of curlicues, gusting up and down against a blue bowl of sky. Harry pressed deeper, vaguely ashamed of snooping but too curious to stop. He could sense water again, like a deeply shadowed pool, and Harry pictured it, saw himself diving in and slicing through it as he swam to the bottom.\nIt was filled with so many things, sour regrets and fear and hopeless longing and even love -- Malfoy's emotions flowing around him. He couldn\u2019t separate them but realized with sudden, anguished frustration that he would be able to, if he was allowed. He would be able to wade through the dark and light of Malfoy\u2019s magic, to the core of who he was, if only he had enough desire to, -- and if Malfoy had enough courage to let him.\nMalfoy made a little sound. His body pulled away from Harry's and Harry was wrenched out of Malfoy's mind, away from the deep secrets that he was suddenly desperate to know.\n\u201cIf you\u2019d let go of me, Potter?\u201d Malfoy asked, voice cool and too-polite. Harry realized that his arms had tightened around Malfoy, whose body had gone stiff. Malfoy pressed his hand against Harry\u2019s ribs in silent entreaty to be released.\nWith some effort, Harry loosened his arms. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Malfoy interrupted, frowning. \u201cI'm not sure what you were doing but I\u2019d very much appreciate it if you didn\u2019t investigate our link without my knowledge or permission. It woke me up and, beyond that, is rude.\n\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Harry said again, a little lamely. \u201cI was just checking, you know, to see if it had grown.\u201d His cheeks heated at the lie.\n\u201cAnd I suppose it has?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I think so.\u201d\nMalfoy stared at him for a moment and shrugged. Harry prepared himself for a nasty comment, but all Malfoy said was, \u201cAll right. Shall we?\u201d\nAlthough not looking forward to another cold shower, Harry nodded, and they walked together to the bathroom.\n***\nMalfoy\u2019s polite streak continued, much to Harry\u2019s aggravation. The worst part was that he didn\u2019t even seem to be doing it for amusements\u2019 sake, as he might have done in prior years, if he\u2019d known it would annoy Harry this much. Instead, he was perfectly civil and even solicitous.\nHarry hated it.\nAt mealtimes, Malfoy offered to sit at the Gryffindor table, \u201cif you prefer.\u201d At first, Harry felt vaguely suspicious and muttered something about, \u201chalf and half is only fair,\u201d so as to not fall into whatever duplicitous trap Malfoy had in store for him.\nThis led to them swapping tables at each meal, much in the same way as before, but at least it had been agreed upon beforehand. Malfoy would sit at Gryffindor and discuss core theory with Hermione while they ate breakfast. Later, they switched to the Slytherin table, whose occupants seemed to be getting used to Harry\u2019s presence enough that not all conversations immediately fell silent when he and Malfoy approached. Parkinson and Zabini continued teasing Harry in that light, snarky way that he was growing accustomed to and actually found rather funny at times, but the whispered conversations stopped when Parkinson began one over lunch, only to have Malfoy shakd his head at her. His face was like stone, washed of all compromise and lacking both amusement and sneer.\n\u201cIt\u2019s rude, Pansy,\u201d he explained levelly.\nAstonishingly, Harry thought it was the look, more than Malfoy\u2019s words that had gotten her to subside. Just as shocking, she did.\nMalfoy loaded a plate of food and handed it to Harry, reminiscent of the first time they had eaten together. Harry looked down and saw all of his favorite things to eat on the plate: two different kinds of roast beef, roasted potatoes as well as mashed with gravy, and a small serving of the steamed and spiced cauliflower, which no one ever seemed to eat.\nNo one but Harry.\nHe threw a swift look at Malfoy and got a patient expression in return. \u201cDid you need anything else, Potter?\u201d\n\u201cEr, no. Thanks. This is great,\u201d Harry said, understanding for the first time Malfoy\u2019s surprise when Harry had piled a plate for him, filling it with his favorite foods. He hadn\u2019t even thought about it, then; it had been simple mechanics. For seven years, he had watched Malfoy. He knew without thinking what foods Malfoy preferred.\nHarry always knew it had been reciprocal but that didn\u2019t explain why he was so stupidly pleased about it.\nAfter another Potions class and Advanced Herbology -- which Malfoy had asked politely that Harry join him in as it was practical work, rather than magical -- they met with Professor Highlash again.\nHighlash instructed them to work on rudimentary spells together, blending their magic as they cast. This was easier explained than done -- there was a constant bristle against each other\u2019s core. When their eleventh Aguamenti had miscast \u2014 this time spraying a weird gray sludge into the professor\u2019s face with Harry\u2019s wand and producing an odd little trickle of brown water from Malfoy's \u2014 Highlash took off his glasses with controlled patience, cast a cleaning charm, and rubbed his eyes.\n\u201cAll right. I can see we\u2019ve been going about this the wrong way,\u201d he finally said. \u201cYou two are such a perfect pairing of Elemental Cores that it should be simpler than this. And yet each of you is resisting using perfectly good magic that is lending to your core strength just waiting to be utilized.\u201d\nHarry sighed heavily, already exhausted. \u201cCould it be an issue of\u2026 clashing personalities?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s doubtful. One of the cases I reviewed was a pair of Auror partners who were incredibly different and in fact had no friendship until after they had been bonded but were quite dedicated to breaking their link,\u201d Professor Highlash said. He flicksd his wand at a bit of sludge sticking to the top of his shoe and continued. \u201cDespite their differences, they had been working together very well for several years. They knew each other.\u201d\n\u201cWe know each other,\u201d Harry said, then wondered immediately how true that was. Knowing the things someone liked to eat and the things they had done, wasn\u2019t the same as knowing them.\nHighlash looked at him and tilted his head. \u201cDo you?\u201d he asked, echoing Harry\u2019s thoughts. \u201cCan you?\u201d\nMalfoy shrugged, looking down at the floor. \u201cWe\u2019re dedicated to breaking the link,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cBoth of us.\u201d\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Highlash said heavily. \u201cWe need to work on trust exercises, I think. We\u2019ll meet again on Friday. Please work on spell casting whenever you have a free period. If you manage to produce a successful spell together \u2014 nothing more taxing than Aguamenti or Wingardium Leviosa, please \u2014 you can attempt casting through one another\u2019s wands. By this I mean, one of you casts, the other holds. And for Merlin\u2019s sake, gentlemen, get to know each other in the meantime. Ask questions. Tell the truth. Talk.\u201d\nIn what looked like a fit of stomping out while trying not to seem like he was stomping out, Professor Highlash left them alone together.\nHarry turned to Malfoy. \u201cSo, er, what's your favorite Quidditch team?\u201d\nAfter a long inhale through flaring nostrils, Malfoy\u2019s face returned to its composed expression. \u201cI\u2019m fairly certain that\u2019s not what he meant, Potter.\u201d\nHarry floundered. \u201cWell, I mean, it\u2019s not a bad place to start, is it?\u201d\n\u201cPuddlemere,\" Malfoy said with a slight grimace, obviously just giving up.\n***\nThey peppered each other with questions throughout the rest of the day. Harry learned that Malfoy\u2019s favorite dessert was a kind of chocolate truffle from France, that he spoke four languages, and that he had seen a few minutes of a cartoon on a Muggle television once as child when his parents had taken him through London on their way to an Apparition point. When Harry asked, Malfoy politely explained that he took Advanced Herbology because of its importance in relation to potions and that he planned to become a Healer. If they let me, went unsaid but was heard in the lengthy silence after his statement.\nDespite their history together, Harry could quite easily see Malfoy in that profession. He was smart, extremely logical, and worked with a graceful sort of efficiency that Harry thought would probably come in handy for someone in the medical field.\nFor his part, Harry answered any questions that Malfoy had a mind to ask. He liked Treacle Tarts, was going to train to be an Auror, and had only been out of England once before Hogwarts, when he was seven, on a trip to Paris when his aunt and uncle couldn\u2019t figure out a way to lock him in his cupboard for five days in a row. (He left that part out, as well as the part about having to sleep in the closet in the hotel.)\nHe wanted to visit Brazil one day because he was interested in the variety of South American magic he had heard of. He rooted for the Cannons, but mostly for loyalty\u2019s sake because it was the first professional Quidditch Team he had ever been introduced to, through Ron. (He did say that part. He quite liked the Puddlemere United as well.)\nWhenever Harry would answer a question, Malfoy would raise his eyebrows a little and murmur, \u201cMmm.\u201d Whenever he would answer one of Harry\u2019s, it was always spoken in a very level tone of voice, not quite pompous enough to be dismissive, but only just.\nIt was driving Harry mental.\nHonestly, it wasn\u2019t as though he liked when Malfoy was a git to him (Mostly. Usually. Although it could be oddly funny at times) but at least when he was, there wasn\u2019t this frustrating distance between them. At least then, he was real.\u00a0 Harry had no clue how they were going to be able to trust each other if he couldn\u2019t dig them out of the mess he\u2019d made by asking for Malfoy\u2019s courtesy.\nIt was unnatural, anyway.\nIt wasn\u2019t until they got into bed that night that it occurred to Harry that the way to push through Malfoy\u2019s rigid propriety might be to just be honest. Or to irritate the hell out of him. That one was better, actually.\nHe waited until they were settled under the covers and swathed in moonlight from the window.\n\u201cUp for a few more questions, Malfoy?\u201d\nMalfoy shifted. \u201cI suppose.\u201d\n\u201cWhere is the coldest place you\u2019ve ever been?\u201d\n\u201cIceland.\u201d\n\u201cThe hottest?\u201d\n\u201cEgypt.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your middle name?\u201d\n\u201cLucius Black.\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s the Greengrass girl?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s\u2014 Fuck off, Potter!\u201d Malfoy blurted.\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s not a Potter,\u201d Harry said dryly, trying to contain his glee. \u201cAnd remember, we\u2019re supposed to get to know each other.\u201d\nThere was another one of those long, controlled inhalations and pauses. Finally, Malfoy said, \u201cIt was never going to work, anyway.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cBeing considerate to you. You\u2019re too\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m too\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cMuch,\u201d Malfoy said, voice surprisingly sad. \u201cFine, I\u2019ll tell you if I get to ask you some real questions, too.\u201d\nHarry felt a ripple of unease. \u201cThat\u2019s fair, I guess. How many?\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s say\u2026 We can start with three each?\u201d Malfoy asked, his tone lacking its usual confidence.\n\u201cOkay,\" Harry said. \"Who is she?\u201d \nMalfoy grunted, and rolled over to face Harry. His face had taken on that familiar tightness Harry could feel in their link. \u201cIf you really must know, our families are in talks.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Harry waited and, when Malfoy didn\u2019t expand, shrugged a little. \u201cAbout what?\u201d\nMalfoy gave an exasperated sigh. \u201cAbout us, you nitwit. Her family is one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight, as is mine. It\u2019s a fairly common practice for Pureblood families to arrange marriages for their offspring when said offspring comes of age. Astoria is in sixth year, so I\u2019d still have some time, but\u2026\u201d\nHarry didn\u2019t know what to say. His mouth felt dry and as distasteful as he found the idea of someone else picking who he was going to marry, he had the fleeting thought that that wasn\u2019t why he was so bothered.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he finally settled on saying. \u201cDo you ever think about saying no?\u201d\n\u201cIs that your second question?\u201d\n\u201cIf it has to be,\u201d Harry said, a little startled.\n\u201cYes, then,\u201d Malfoy admitted. \u201cI think about saying no. Every bloody day. The problem is, I don\u2019t have any real reason to. Even if I did, I\u2019m the sole Malfoy heir, with a duty to produce the next, so there\u2019s that, as well.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 That\u2019s really awful, Malfoy.\u201d\nMalfoy shrugged. His face lost that pinched look and he looked at Harry carefully. \u201cDo you have another?\u201d\nHarry thought for a moment. He immediately dismissed several questions from his mind as either too intrusive or too inappropriate. \u201cHow\u2019s your mum?\u201d\n\u201cMy mother?\u201d Malfoy\u2019s pale eyebrows inched higher on his brow.\n\u201cWell, yeah. All I know is what I read. And she did, you know, save my life,\u201d Harry muttered. \u201cI thought about sending her a letter, but I know how she feels about--\"\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything about how she feels about anything,\u201d Malfoy snapped. He stopped and took a deep, calming breath. In a modified tone, he said, \u201cShe would almost certainly appreciate that. She sends her regards to you in every letter I get.\u201d\n\u201cThanks for telling me,\u201d Harry said sarcastically.\n\u201cI just did, so shut it. To answer your question, she\u2019s better. They allowed her to spend her parole, which is almost over, under house arrest. The Ministry chose not to snap her wand and she's allowed quarterly visits with my father. In many ways, she\u2019s doing much better,\u201d Malfoy said, listing off each item as though it were simply raw data. But Harry felt the pull of something deeper in his core, a breeze of sadness and something sweeter, like pride and love combined.\nHe looked over again and found Malfoy staring at him, brows lifted and mouth quirked. He felt the strange urge to skim his fingers across Malfoy\u2019s lips, curled into a smile that wasn\u2019t mocking or cruel. Harry fisted his hands and looked away. \u201cYour turn.\u201d\n\u201cHmmm,\u201d Malfoy said, voice light and sly. \u201cLet\u2019s see. There are just so many I could choose from\u2026\u201d\nRolling his eyes, Harry fought back a laugh. \u201cOut with it. You get three.\u201d\n\u201cWhy did you and the girl Weasel break up?\u201d\nSurprised, Harry opened his eyes. \u201cReally? That\u2019s your first question?\u201d\nMalfoy nodded.\nHarry drew a hand through his hair. He didn\u2019t want to say anything that would make Ginny look bad, or reveal anything that would make their bed-sharing situation more uncomfortable than it already was, but he had promised to tell the truth. He copied Malfoy and took a long, deep breath.\n\u201cIt was a lot of things. She\u2026 ah\u2026 She was thrown together with Dean during the War a lot. While I was gone. And, er, things happen during a war. And when she told me, I didn\u2019t have the best reaction,\u201d Harry admitted, remembering the utter fury that had swamped him when she had confessed her renewed feelings for Dean, right after Fred\u2019s funeral, and how close they had gotten. He remembered the way her eyes had shined with tears.\nHarry\u2019s throat tightened. He coughed to clear it. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t all her. I mean, I reacted badly. But it wasn\u2019t like we were together, not really. I left her alone for a really long time. There were times when she thought I was dead; she always knew I could be. And I changed, too, a lot, while I was gone. I don\u2019t think it would have worked out, anyway, really. We\u2019re trying to be friends now. I think we can be.\u201d\nMalfoy was watching him steadily. He looked grave. \u201cDo you still love her?\u201d\n\u201cIs that your second question?\u201d\nMalfoy smiled a little. \u201cAll right.\u201d\n\u201cYes. And no. It\u2019s different now, like everything is. I still feel, I guess, sort of possessive about her. I don\u2019t exactly like that she and Dean really got back together; that makes everything else feel like less of something she fell into and more\u2026\u201d\n\u201cPremediated?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Harry hesitated. \u201cBut Ginny\u2019s special. She deserves someone who makes her happy. And I think, you know, I deserve someone who can\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBe faithful during wartime,\u201d Malfoy supplied when Harry wavered.\nHe grunted. \u201cLike I said, we weren\u2019t really together, together. I basically broke up with her at the end of sixth year because I knew a lot of what would be coming. But\u2026 yeah.\u201d\nMalfoy gave a little, \u201cHmmm,\u201d of understanding and fell silent for a few minutes.\n\u201cLast one?\u201d Harry prompted when the quiet had gone on too long for his comfort.\n\u201cWhy did you react that way when I commented on your food intake?\u201d Malfoy asked, a little cautiously.\nOh. Harry swallowed and onto his back. He stared at the bed hangings and heard Professor Highlash in his head. Tellthetruth. Tellthetruth. The truth of it was that it still felt raw when Harry thought about the boy he\u2019d been. He didn\u2019t understand why it bothered him so much more now, at eighteen, than it did when he was eleven. But when he woke up from nightmares, they were rarely about Voldemort anymore.\nThey were usually about his cupboard.\n\u201cYou asked if they starved me, growing up,\u201d Harry said abruptly. \u201cWell, they did, pretty much. I don\u2019t like to talk about it. It felt low, even for you.\u201d\n\u201cWait, what do you mean, \u2018they did?'\u201d Malfoy said, his voice taking on an odd, choked quality. \u201cYou\u2019re Harry Potter.\u201d\n\u201cRight, but I didn\u2019t know that that meant anything until I came to Hogwarts,\u201d Harry said. He closed his eyes. \u201cI was just Harry Potter, who lived in the cupboard under the stairs. I cooked for them and they didn\u2019t let me eat much of it, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2026 They\u2026 You\u2026\u201d Malfoy\u2019s voice was shocked.\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m tired. I answered your questions. I want to go to bed now. We\u2019ll talk about other stuff in the morning,\u201d Harry said. It came out too hard but he couldn\u2019t really help it. He felt too exposed, every word like broken glass was in his throat, and he didn\u2019t want to start crying in front of Malfoy, of all people. No matter how remotely decent he seemed in the dark.\nHe rolled onto his opposite side, pushing away the static of anger and pain that tried to fight to the surface whenever he thought about his childhood lately. He shut his eyes against the tears that prickled, but then, suddenly, there was a palm pressing gently against the protruding angle of his shoulder blade and just as swiftly removed. He felt a rush of something cool and calming inside, like taking a long drink of sweet well-water after having been out in the sun all day.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he thought he heard, softly. For a moment, for just that night, it was enough.\n***\nThe morning dawned rather like the days before, Malfoy pressed tight against Harry\u2019s body, one arm thrown across his waist. But for the first time, Harry wasn\u2019t startled by this fact upon waking up. It was possible he was just getting used to it but it very likely had something to do with what he could feel pressed against his hip. Seemed like Malfoy might have the same problem he did.\nHe stayed there, cheek resting atop Malfoy\u2019s head, and contemplated the previous night. He wondered if he had imagined -- or possibly dreamed -- Malfoy\u2019s gentle compassion, so different than he\u2019d ever been before upon hearing about one of Harry\u2019s weaknesses. But he could almost feel the press of Malfoy's hand on his shoulder blade, still, warm through his faded shirt. He could feel the flare of their link and the rush of centredness that Malfoy had somehow given him.\nHe wanted to close his eyes and pilfer the link for a few moments before Malfoy woke up and became guarded again, but instead jostled his shoulder a little. \u201cMalfoy.\u201d\n\u201cMerlin, Potter, do you never sleep?\u201d Malfoy mumbled into his chest, not moving.\nHarry blinked. Smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s a little hard when someone else is taking up three-quarters of the bed and using me as a cushion,\u201d he whispered back.\nMalfoy woke up at that. He started to pull away, but Harry clamped a hard arm around his shoulders.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Malfoy said suspiciously, blinking sleep from his eyes and trying to squirm away.\nHarry was fully aware of the hard press of Malfoy\u2019s erection against his hip. He blushed a little but didn\u2019t let go. \u201cI want to try something.\u201d\nMalfoy looked up at him with wide eyes, a pink stain spreading across his cheeks, lips parting in disbelief. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cWith your permission, I\u2019d like to try to explore the link a little. I, I won\u2019t do anything intrusive. Or, I\u2019ll try not to. And, um, you can look too,\u201d Harry offered quietly, when it seemed like Malfoy might say no. \u201cI think it might work best when we don\u2019t have a lot of distractions. When we\u2019re close -- you know, physically -- like this.\u201d\n\u201cAll right.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d Harry asked, surprised.\nMalfoy rolled his eyes. \u201cWell, we\u2019re not making much progress doing it in front of Highlash, are we? And we both want our magic to be our own again, right?\u201d Harry nodded. Malfoy sniffed. \u201cThen maybe exploring the combination of our cores will help us better understand them,\u201d he said. \u201cSo all right.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. So, I\u2019m not really sure what the best way to do it for you is,\u201d Harry said. His cheeks grew hotter. \u201cWhat I mean is, because we\u2019re exploring different elements inside each other, it\u2019ll probably be different for you. I just sort of\u2026 let my mind go unfocused and hazy, like my eyes when I\u2019m looking for the Snitch, and let it wander into whatever feels\u2026 the most you, I guess. That\u2019s what I did yesterday morning, anyway.\u201d\nDutifully, Malfoy closed his eyes. Harry followed suit. A thousand impressions filled his mind at once: Malfoy pressed against him, warm and hard and angled; the smell of Malfoy's hair; the brightness of the sun beyond his eyelids. He let them all come, not picking one in particular, until he felt the cool ripple of water brush against his core. He followed the sensation.\nThe feathers were in flight again in his mind, leading him to the pool. It was bright and clear near the top, the water a shimmering sort of silver that made him think of Malfoy\u2019s eyes, and Harry saw himself diving, stroking against his natural buoyancy to press into the depths. The deeper he got, the murkier and colder the water became. He looked around, feeling the lightness of his body that water created, but could also sense the rise and fall of his lungs. He shivered, wrapped in emotions so deep he wondered just how much of himself Malfoy kept hidden.\nHarry floated for a few minutes, letting the sensations slide around him. Like the previous morning, they were emotions, mostly, hiding in the tiny discrepancies of colour and changes in temperature the water brought. The murky brown-grey was something ugly and frightened. Harry shied away from that. Something dark blue slid against his cheek and, though it didn\u2019t seem to have any overtly hostile overtones, Harry somehow knew instinctively that it was incredibly private. He felt another sweep of water, in shining lavender, against his torso, and without thinking, Harry plucked it up. It felt... innocent.\nIt was like a Pensieve, almost. As soon as he held the swirling liquid in his hand, images filled his mind. He saw Malfoy as a very young boy, maybe four or five. Malfoy's father, younger as well and without the supercilious gravitas Harry associated with him, was holding his hand as they walked through gardens populated with white peacocks and flowers the likes of which Harry had never seen before. As he watched, young Malfoy turned his pointed chin up to Lucius and said something that Harry couldn't hear. Lucius threw his head back on a laugh and swept young Malfoy up into his arms.\nHarry opened his hand and let the water escape, feeling sad.\nHe floated in place for a moment, feeling Malfoy investigate his own inner-workings, a twist inside that was simultaneously blissful and gnawing. At random, he grabbed another swash of water, coloured a pale blue-green. It felt vaguely sad, but also rather settled.\nHe was looking down at a letter.\n\n\n\u2026so it is true, yes, that the Nott family has joined the list of Purebloods whose friends have been getting death threats simply for choosing not to cut off all contact. And yes, it is true as well that the Ministry is overlooking such behavior right now. But, darling boy, this is nothing that should concern you. I\u2019m very glad that you have a friend in Harry who, while perhaps impulsive and poorly-raised in regard to his opinions on blood status, has never has been the sort to frighten easily. Besides which, it is very unlikely (not impossible, granted, but unlikely) that anyone would make an attempt on his life the likes of which happened to the Garnier\u2019s for staying loyal to my acquaintance. \n\n\n\n\nPlease don't worry, Draco. Remember who Potter is and his special status at this current time. It will protect him from much, and by extension you. And please give him my regards as well.\n\n\n\n\n Love, \n\n\n\n\nMother\n\n\nHarry saw a splash of something wet against the parchment. He released the memory, stunned and not a little sad at the mutual deception Malfoy and his mum were engaged in. Then a deep inner-jolt pulled him from his thoughts and he spared a moment to wonder what the hell Malfoy was doing.\nHarry looked around at the water, beautiful, mysterious, and painful with every ebb and flow. He swam deeper until the colours were swalllowed in darkness. Beyond him, there was an orange-gold light and he pursued it, pushing against the stubborn resistance of the tide that was keeping him away.\nAt length, he reached his goal: a strong, pulsing a pillar of light. He blinked against the shine of it and approached cautiously, surveying that it wasn\u2019t alone \u2014 it was wrapped around something silky and pale, or perhaps melted together with it. It was breathtaking.\nHarry\u2019s eyes snapped open. His breath came in short, sharp pants. He paused a moment to steady himself and take stock.\nHe was hard and aching, his whole body warmed by the experience and by the pressure of Malfoy against him, who was breathing steadily, as if in a trance. Harry blew out a long breath, heart racing; he was fairly certain he had just seen the place where the cores of their magic were linked.\nAfter a few minutes, he felt Malfoy come back into himself, stirring against him languidly.\n\u201cMalfoy?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cWere you able to\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it like? I mean, mine?\u201d Harry asked hesitantly.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a cave, with dark earth and growing things, and so many trees,\u201d Malfoy said quietly after a moment. \u201cDeep in it, there\u2019s a fire that grew, the closer I got. It was hot, but didn't burn when I touched it.\u201d\n\u201cYours is like swimming in a pond in the sky,\u201d Harry said. It wasn\u2019t the most accurate description but he had no access to words that would fit.\nMalfoy lifted his head. \u201cPotter\u2014\u201c\nHarry kissed him.\nLater, he wouldn\u2019t be able to decide if he had planned it, or if it had been an impulse based on seeing inside Malfoy and hearing a new tone in his voice that was deep and low and arousing. But as he fit his mouth against Malfoy\u2019s, he had the fleeting thought that he had been waiting for this for much longer than the last several minutes.\nMalfoy made a small noise in the back of his throat and stilled at the contact of Harry\u2019s lips against his own. Harry increased the pressure, just slightly, keeping the kiss soft and questing. Malfoy responded, his lips moving gently, opening when Harry slid his tongue against the seam of them. Harry\u2019s tongue slid inside Malfoy\u2019s mouth and he jerked at the hot slip of Malfoy's tongue touching it. \nMalfoy made another little noise. He rolled them over so he was on top of Harry, legs spread in a straddle over Harry's hips. Harry gripped them, gasping at drape of Malfoy\u2019s slender body over his own as the kiss continued, still gentle, still heartbreakingly sweet. A long, long, time they kissed, and Harry lost himself in it, lost himself in the feel of Malfoy, the taste of him, the tentative wonder of something fitting.\nHe could feel Malfoy\u2019s cock, rubbing against his own with excruciating slowness. He rolled his hips upward in response and was rewarded when Malfoy groaned. Malfoy wrenched his mouth away. He sat up, breathing raggedly, lips swollen and slick, and stared down in astonishment and more than a little anger.\n\u201cWhat? What did you see?\u201d\nStartled, Harry\u2019s fingers flexed on Malfoy\u2019s hips. \u201cI\u2014 I saw a memory of you walking with your father when you were little. I saw you reading a letter. What did you see?\u201d\nSomething in Malfoy\u2019s face relaxed. \u201cWhy did you kiss me?\u201d\nHarry shook his head in confusion. \u201cI wanted to.\u201d\nMalfoy gave a laugh like cut glass. \u201cYou stupid Gryffindor. You\u2019ll never have any sense, will you?\u201d\nOffended, Harry started to push Malfoy off, but was halted by Malfoy\u2019s hands, batting his away. Malfoy swooped back down, kissing Harry roughly this time. Their teeth clashed and he nipped Harry\u2019s bottom lip just a little too hard before pulling away to rest his forehead against Harry\u2019s with a ragged breath, their gazes locking.\n\u201cThis is an incredibly bad idea, you know,\u201d he said in a low growl.\nHarry grinned recklessly and licked his lower lip, tasting copper. \u201cI\u2019m sort of known for them. I\u2019m also known for not caring.\u201d\nMalfoy chuckled, then trapped Harry\u2019s wrists in his hands, pressing them tight against the mattress. Arousal thudded through Harry\u2019s body and he arched up. \u201cWhat do you want, Malfoy?\u201d\nMalfoy grinned. He pressed an open-mouthed kiss against Harry\u2019s neck, scraping the skin lightly with his teeth, and Harry groaned. \u201cA lot. But as much as I enjoy seeing you pinned beneath me, we have to go. We have to talk to Highlash.\u201d\nDisappointment flooded through Harry as Malfoy climbed off him but he nodded gamely, trying to catch his breath. \u201cOkay. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a shower cold enough to compensate,\u201d he grumbled, pleased when Malfoy laughed again.\n\u201cYou won\u2019t need it.\u201d\nThey each used the facilities, and it was at once more and less awkward than each time before. As Malfoy began the shower, Harry spared a brief moment to wonder at the massive shift in Malfoy\u2019s, behavior -- whether it was brought on by the link, by Harry\u2019s kiss, or by Malfoy himself.\nThey stepped in and oh, sweet Merlin, the water was blessedly hot. Harry stood back, preparing to let Malfoy to take the lead in washing as per usual, when Malfoy gripped him by the waist and pressed him up against the tile wall. Wicked grey eyes met Harry\u2019s, and then he was being snogged senseless.\nHarry kissed him back, rubbing his tongue against Malfoy\u2019s, gasping as a warm, slick hand trailed down his hips and brushed against his cock. He pushed blindly into the feeling and heard a delighted snicker in return just before Malfoy\u2019s fist wrapped around him. \u201c\nOh, my god,\u201d Harry mumbled. His head fell back against the wall as Malfoy began moving his hand up and down with tight, slow strokes. Harry thrust his hips into it, matching Malfoy's steady rhythm. He reached out instinctively, clasping one hand around Malfoy to grip the slope of his arse and tentatively sweeping his fingers over the head of Malfoy\u2019s cock. He heard a soft hum of appreciation over the sound of the water.\nHarry looked down. Malfoy\u2019s prick was long and hard and slender, rather like Malfoy himself, jutting out from a nest of curls just slightly more golden than the hair on his head. Harry brushed his fingers over the crown, sweeping a curious thumb over the slit, and felt slick moisture leaking there. Malfoy groaned into his ear.\nHarry tried to distract himself from the rather exquisite sensations Malfoy was creating on his cock by experimenting. He wrapped his own fist around Malfoy, leaving his thumb loose so he could stroke the head with on each down stroke, the way he liked doing to himself when he wanked. Malfoy hissed softly through his teeth and Harry loosened his hand.\n\u201cDid I hurt you?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Fuck. Do that again,\u201d Malfoy ordered. His hand moved faster and Harry groaned before grasping him again. They set a steady pace, each matching the other\u2019s movements, and suddenly Harry could feel his balls tighten, could feel the rush of pleasure gather at the base of his spine.\n\u201cMalfoy,\u201d he gasped, but that felt weird, felt wrong, when everything else felt so good. \u201cDraco. I\u2019m going to\u2014\u201c\n\u201cCome, Harry,\u201d Malfoy demanded, clenching his fist and picking up speed.\nHelplessly, Harry did, finishing over Malfoy\u2019s knuckles with long, sticky ropes. He panted as the orgasm washed through him, his fingers slacking for a moment before resuming their task with renewed dedication.\nMalfoy leaned against him, pressing Harry hard into the tiles, clutching at his waist and shoulder and shuddering hard breaths into his ear. Harry let go of Malfoy\u2019s backside and reached between his legs, grasping his balls and giving them a gentle tug. Malfoy moaned, low and strained, and came, bucking into Harry\u2019s moving hand.\nThey rested like that for several long, lovely moments. Harry could feel his heart pounding in his wrists, his groin, his chest and throat. The link felt set aflame between them and Harry felt that same gorgeous glow that he had sensed from Malfoy the previous morning.\nFinally, Malfoy lifted his head. Harry smiled, a little uncertainly, pleased when Malfoy\u2019s lips quirked up in response.\n\u201cFascinating!\u201d Professor Highlash said, looking at them with wide eyes. \u201cYou were able to access each other\u2019s memories? Can you validate that they were real?\u201d\n\u201cWell, er, I assumed so, Sir,\u201d Harry said, licking his lips and trying not to look over at Malfoy for fear of giving himself away by blushing. They sat propped against a long desk, the length of Malfoy\u2019s body pressed to his side. \u201cI, um, saw Malfoy walking in a kind of garden when he was little with his father and he said something that made him laugh. His father picked him up, then. There were peacocks there.\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds like our country estate,\u201d Malfoy said, nodding \u201cPotter\u2019s never been there. I don\u2019t have a specific reference for that memory, but my father and I often walked through the gardens when I was small.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you, Mr. Malfoy?\u201d\nFor the first time, Malfoy hesitated. Harry cast him a sidelong glance, curious, and Malfoy bit his lip. \u201cI saw him on his first day at Hogwarts, with the Sorting Hat. He, ah, was almost Sorted into Slytherin.\u201d\nAstonished for a multitude of reasons, Harry nodded dumbly. \u201cYou could hear it?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t hear anything. I only got visuals,\u201d Harry said. He wondered if his near-Sorting into Slytherin might be one of the reasons for Malfoy\u2019s sudden change from cruelty and reticence to the combination of lust and clumsy affection he'd displayed that morning.\n\u201cThat\u2019s interesting,\u201d Professor Highlash interjected. \u201cWhile both senses are important, sight is the most necessary when casting magic. Mr. Malfoy, how much could you see?\u201d\n\u201cA little, here and there. Like bursts of image, just enough that I understood what I was seeing.\u201d He paused. \u201cBut, that\u2019s actually what I wanted to ask you about, Professor. Potter\u2019s magic is\u2026 It\u2019s very powerful.\u201d\n\u201cWell, one would assume so,\u201d Highlash agreed mildly, glancing at Harry. \u201cThe Boy Who Lived Twice\u2026\u201d\nHarry winced. Malfoy shook his head. \u201cNo. I mean, he can do wandless, wordless spells. Occasionally accidental, but also intentionally.\u201d\u00a0 Highlash looked to Harry for confirmation and Harry nodded, confused. Malfoy continued, \u201cAnd, when I was exploring his core\u2026 The fire I mentioned. It was strong. I haven\u2019t felt anything like it before.\u201d\nThe professor stroked his beard thoughtfully. \u201cHow would you describe his, Mr. Potter?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know. There\u2019s power there, a deep well of it. But it\u2019s also very calm in places. I think he may have more control than I do,\u201d Harry admitted, a little grudgingly.\nMalfoy scoffed beside him as if to say obviously, and Harry gave a nudge with his shoulder.\n\u201cWell. I appreciate that you two were able to get so well in tune with one another,\u201d Highlash said. Malfoy\u2019s scoff became a snort. Harry\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cSo, it seems as though we may have a power-imbalance. One of you has a lot of raw energy, the other, control.\u201d Harry opened his mouth to object that he had control as well, but Highlash anticipated it and waved a vague hand. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say that either one of you is magically weak or cannot properly reign in your abilities, but it is something to consider when it comes to untangling that your cores. Have you worked on spells together?\u201d\nHarry and Malfoy exchanged a swift look. The little practice they'd done hadn\u2019t gone well.\n\u201cNot a lot,\u201d Malfoy said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working on getting to know each other, like you told us.\u201d\nThis time it was Harry who snorted. He saw the flicker of a smile around Malfoy\u2019s mouth.\n\u201cThat\u2019s quite good,\u201d Highlash said. \u201cAs I\u2019ve stated, you two are a perfect pairing of elements. I\u2019d be surprised if you were unable to connect. The elements you draw your magic from indicate who you are, and each of these characteristics can be applied to your personalities as well. For example, Earth, Mr. Potter, indicates that you are strong, that you care for those around you, and that you endure. And the element of Fire in your personality and magic is purifying -- it can create or destroy and speaks of a strong will and courage \u2014 no surprise there. Air, Mr. Malfoy, indicates that your primary use of magic is through intellect and creativity. The water indicates extreme adaptability to any circumstance.\n\u201cEach of these characteristics are needed in the use of magic,\u201d Highlash continued. \u201cThe complication, I suspect, is that you each rely on your primary elements while overlooking your ability to draw from the others. This is what we\u2019re going to do today.\u201d\nHe began them on tandem casting, working on creating water. Over and over, they recreated the spell until they were each able to produce a gush of water from their wands, while pulling power from the other.\u00a0 It was a strange feeling; Harry was so accustomed to using his own magic that it felt like trying to produce from nothing until he could focus on that pinpoint breeze inside of Malfoy. In turn, however, whenever Malfoy pulled from him, Harry could feel it hold tight in an attempt to stay. It verged on painful, but he tried to relax, to let it happen.\nThey moved on to trying to cast for each other\u2019s wand. Almost immediately, Malfoy got water to stream from Harry\u2019s wand while Harry held it. Harry, however, was unable to stop the spray of liquid from Malfoy's wand when they tried in reverse, until the water had overflowed in the glass and spread over the whole table, repeatedly.\n\u201cVery good work, Gentlemen!\u201d Highlash said near lunchtime. Harry gave a sigh of relief, glancing over at Malfoy, who was sweaty and tousled and paler than normal. He wondered if he looked just as bad; as simple as the spell was, borrowing from someone else\u2019s core \u2014 and allowing them to borrow from yours \u2014 was exhausting.\u00a0 \u201cPlease continue your private meditative explorations. Mr. Potter, I want you to be able to fill the water to the top of the glass without spilling any. We\u2019ll meet again tomorrow.\u201d\nHarry and Malfoy trudged out, heading to the Dining Hall. Once they were out of sight, Malfoy stopped and sagged against the wall. \u201cI just need a minute.\u201d\nHarry looked at him in concern. Students milled around them, glancing in their general direction, but Harry ignored their presence. He leaned his mouth close to Malfoy\u2019s ear. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\nMalfoy nudged him back, glancing around surreptitiously. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI think you\u2019re used to using more magic than necessary for even the simplest of spells, that\u2019s all.\u201d\nHarry examined him. Malfoy looked more drained than Harry felt -- which was saying something.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Harry said. \u201cWe missed breakfast; you\u2019ll feel better when you\u2019ve had something to eat.\u201d\nMalfoy wearily shoved away from the wall and they continued to the Dining Hall. Harry walked over to the Slytherin table without waiting to have a debate about it. Malfoy\u2019s pale eyebrows climbed up his forehead but he sat down next to Harry without comment.\nParkinson stared at them a moment. \u201cAll right, Draco?\u201d\nMalfoy shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019ll be over soon. It\u2019s a bit exhausting having to work with someone as thick as Potter, day in and day out.\u201d\nStung, Harry gritted his teeth, but saw a faint smile play with the edges of Malfoy\u2019s lips. He smirked. \u201cNot as exhausting as it is sharing a bed with someone who likes to cuddle.\u201d\nMalfoy\u2019s head snapped up, cheeks blazing, but his retort was cut off by Parkinson and Zabini, who positively howled with laughter.\n\u201cOh, Potter!\u201d Parkinson hooted, dabbing at her eyes. \u201cSometimes I actually think you\u2019re not half bad. Maybe we\u2019ll consider keeping you.\u201d\n\u201cWe nearly did,\u201d Malfoy said, narrowing his eyes at Harry. \u201cDid you know he was almost Sorted into Slytherin?\u201d\nZabini looked at Harry appraisingly. \u201cReally? The Golden Boy was almost a Serpent?\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t something he talked about but it wasn\u2019t a secret either and his fears about being the Heir of Slytherin were long over. Harry grinned and nodded, swallowing a mouthful of food. \u201cYou say that like not everyone knows I\u2019m a Parselmouth. Was. Am. Whatever.\u201d\n\u201cI really do like you more and more,\u201d Parkinson murmured, keeping a keen watch on Draco, who was deliberately paying more attention to his food than the three of them. She smirked. \u201cSo, the bed-sharing is going all right, then? Can we come visit tonight?\u201d\n\u201cExcept for that he steals all of the covers, snores like a three-headed dog, and the whole situation is appalling in general, it\u2019s fine,\u201d Draco muttered with a scowl. \u201cAnd no. You can\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t want to share him?\u201d Zabini sent a knowing wink in Harry\u2019s direction. Harry rolled his eyes, tamping down on the urge to blush when Malfoy didn\u2019t say anything.\n\u201cWe have to work on an assignment Highlash gave us,\u201d Harry said. \u201cBesides, we haven\u2019t done some of our other homework in days. I thought having fewer classes would mean less homework overall, but\u2026\u201d\nParkinson nodded emphatically, her sleek, dark bob bouncing around her face. \u201cIsn\u2019t it just awful? I know N.E.W.T.\u2019s require a lot of work, but this is mad. I think I\u2019d prefer more class time, honestly. My nails are starting to suffer from neglect.\u201d She held out the forefinger of one hand which, as far as Harry could tell, looked perfect, painted a shiny green.\nAs Parkinson and Zabini launched into a discussion on advanced level courses and the requirements for different subjects, Malfoy shot Harry a grateful look. Harry pressed his pinky against the side of Malfoy\u2019s hand. Malfoy tensed and moved his hand away immediately but underneath the table, Harry felt a single comforting stroke of Malfoy's foot against the back of his calf. Deliberately, Harry nudged the link between them and opened up his side of it, trying to let Malfoy know that it was okay, that if he wasn\u2019t ready to tell, Harry wouldn\u2019t either. He tried to explain without words that he had hopes for later, that the link itself wasn\u2019t so bad, and that neither were Malfoy\u2019s friends. Everything that he didn\u2019t have words for, Harry shoved into the link, splaying his emotions open as wide as he thought necessary.\nHe was wondering if it had worked when Malfoy gave a tiny sound in the back of his throat. A sudden wave of lust hit Harry in the gut. His prick hardened painfully,and he realized that Malfoy had opened up his emotions as well. Harry looked down at his plate, and began eating faster.\n***\nThey barely made it back to their quarters.\nWhen they finished eating, Harry swung with Malfoy over to the Gryffindor table to pass Ron and Hermione. Barely breaking stride, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you guys later, have to study,\u201d and didn\u2019t slow, though he saw Hermione\u2019s eyes flicker rapidly between he and Malfoy, and Ron had opened his mouth to respond.\nWalking along the corridors, they kept the link open between them, something it was becoming easier and easier to do. Harry was flooded with the warmth of Malfoy\u2019s magic, and with it came a primal need that had them walking in quick-step back to their rooms.\nAs soon as the door shut behind them, Harry swung around and shoved Malfoy up against it. He pinned Malfoy\u2019s wrists against the heavy stone and slammed a kiss down on his mouth. Malfoy\u2019s lips opened and he arched his body into Harry\u2019s as Harry shoved his tongue inside. He felt the vibration of Malfoy\u2019s moan more than he heard it and everything inside him shuddered with want.\nMalfoy wrenched his wrists and mouth away from Harry, grasping a handful of Harry\u2019s robes in one fist and marching him backwards toward the sofa, where Harry toppled backward over the arm. Malfoy fell with him, their bodies in close contact, his mouth scraping over the tendons in Harry\u2019s neck before latching on and sucking. Harry groaned, fumbling with the fastenings of Malfoy\u2019s robes and shirt, shoving them haphazardly off his shoulders.\nMalfoy pulled his mouth away. He sat astride Harry to struggle out of his shirt. Harry stared at his rough, frustrated movements, at the pale expanse of skin being exposed. Even that morning in the shower, Harry had felt too astonished by what was happening to properly look at Malfoy disrobing -- which he regretted immediately because it was a fantastic sight.\nMalfoy was slender, his limbs long and pale and loose. Though he looked skinny with his robes on, without them, he was actually covered in fine layers of sleek, althetic muscle. His skin practically glowed, so pale, the complex web of scars over his chest drew Harry's gaze, competing for Harry's attention against the dark blur of his Mark on the inside of his forearm. Harry felt Malfoy freeze on top of him as he gave it a cursory glance before reaching up with lingering fingertips to trace the lines of scar tissue.\nMalfoy let out a breath and shook his head, platinum hair flying about his face. He started working on his belt. \u201cNone of that, now.\u201d\nHarry obediently removed his hands and started tugging off his own clothing. \u201cWhat do we\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Potter, you\u2019re the one who started manhandling me,\u201d Malfoy said with a wicked grin. Harry laughed.\nHe bucked his hips up, taking a glance at the tenting of Malfoy\u2019s trousers and licking his lips. \u201cThat\u2019s a lie, and you know it. You started this at lunch.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Malfoy conceded with a small smile, climbing off Harry to toe off his shoes and socks, and step out of his trousers and pants. \u201cI just didn\u2019t think it would be so successful.\u201d\n\u201cWell, it was.\u201d Harry\u2019s mouth grew drier as even more of Malfoy was exposed. His cock was impressively stiff, and deep red at the head. Harry kicked off his trainers and socks and clumsily wiggled out of his own trousers and pants from his position on the sofa while Malfoy waited impatiently.\nWhen Harry was naked, time seemed to slow down. Malfoy stared down at him for such a long time that he grew self-conscious. He looked up into Malfoy's face, serious and shameless and, swallowing, took his own cock in his hand and gave it a slow stroke. Malfoy\u2019s pupils dilated and Harry did it again.\nSuddenly, Malfoy was back on top of him, rubbing the length of his body against Harry\u2019s. Harry choked at the sensation, everything coiling blurry and bright around him. Their cores pulsed together in time with their heartbeats, in time with the delicious throb of their cocks, as he rutted up against Malfoy.\nMalfoy kissed him, licking breathlessly into Harry\u2019s mouth. He reached down to take both of their cocks in one hand, starting a maddening friction with each pull and twist. Harry looked down to their cocks trapped together, pressed together, in Malfoy\u2019s tight grip. He\u2019d never felt anything like it, seen anything so arousing in his life. He moaned out a cracked, \"Accio lube,\u201d praying that Malfoy had thought to bring some. When nothing arrived, Malfoy huffed a tense laugh at him and released them both.\nA stifled sound broke free from Harry's throat at the loss of contact. But then Malfoy squirmed down the length of his body and, without warning, took the full length of Harry\u2019s cock in his mouth. Harry heard himself whimper, his hand falling automatically into the shiny strands of Malfoy\u2019s hair. Malfoy\u2019s mouth was hot and silky around Harry's cock and he sucked in long, slow strokes, hollowing out his cheeks and swiping his tongue over the head at regular intervals. Harry thrust his hips to get deeper and Malfoy obliged, pulling Harry so far into his mouth that Harry could feel the tip of his pointy nose buried in the curls at his groin.\n\u201cOh, God,\u201d Harry whispered. \u201cDraco, I\u2019m going to come.\u201d\nDraco \u2014 for he could never be just \u2018Malfoy\u2019 again, Harry acknowledged with what little blood was left in his brain \u2014 answered by bobbing his head faster, sucking harder. A stray hand slid along the crevice of Harry\u2019s buttocks and one, long finger burrowed in between them. At the shocking pleasure of a finger stroking his arse, Harry fucked up hard, his orgasm hitting him like the detonation of a bomb.\nDraco gentled the movements of his mouth. He swallowed convulsively, swirling his tongue softly around the head of Harry\u2019s prick until it became too sensitive and Harry had to pull lightly on the hair he was still gripping. Draco released him, his mouth shining and swollen and pink, and finally looked up at Harry with an almost tentative expression. Harry smiled, heart still pounding, and was rewarded with a flash of white, even teeth and a little chuckle.\n\u201cI want to\u2014 Can I do that to you?\u201d Harry blurted.\u00a0 Draco blinked a couple of times and nodded wordlessly.\nDraco climbed off of him and Harry stood, guiding Draco nto a sitting position \u2014 the sofa was too small, and Harry wasn\u2019t sure how Draco had managed to do\u2026 to do that from the position he\u2019d been in. Harry grabbed a pillow and dropped it onto the floor in front of Draco, kneeling on it carefully. He took a deep breath, placing a careful hand on one of Draco\u2019s thighs.\nHarry reach out and grasped the base of Draco's prick. He looked up swiftly to see him chewing on his lower lip as he stared down at Harry\u2019s hand, and Harry slid Draco's foreskin back with one long, tight stroke before dipping his head. Draco\u2019s cock twitched against Harry\u2019s closed lips and Harry darted out a tentative tongue taste him. The gleam of moisture seeping from the slit was warm and salty-bitter and Draco shifted his hips restlessly, placing a hand on Harry\u2019s shoulder.\nHarry took a deep breath and opened mouth, sliding his lips around Draco\u2019s shaft, swirling his tongue around the head as Draco had done as he took more of him in. Draco shuddered, his hand tightening reflexively on Harry\u2019s shoulder. Encouraged, Harry sucked lightly, bobbing his head up and down over the hot, twitching length in his mouth. He experimented by pumping the hand still circling the base of Draco\u2019s prick in time with his movements. After a minute, he pulled away breathlessly.\n\u201cAm I\u2014is that--?\u201d Harry stuttered.\nDraco looked down at him with heavy-lidded, stormy eyes, and suddenly Harry felt a surge of pleasure flow through their link, approval laced with rich want. He lowered his head again, taking Draco in deeper than he had before, enjoying the heavy weight of Draco\u2019s cock on his tongue in a deep, visceral way he hadn\u2019t expected. He moved up and down swiftly, breathing through his nose. When his jaw began to ache, pulled off to begin sucking and licking at the underside of Draco\u2019s erection. Draco gasped.\n\u201cHarry,\u201d he muttered, voice raw. Harry sucked harder, allowing the noises Draco made to lead him in his movements. After several long moments, Draco\u2019s body tightened and he pressed up, gripping Harry\u2019s shoulder with desperate fingers. Harry took his cock in his mouth again just as it began pulsing. Draco cried out and came, shooting salty ribbons against the back of Harry\u2019s throat, and Harry worked to sswallow them all. He took a page from Draco\u2019s book and slowed his motions but didn\u2019t pull off completely until the hand at his shoulder went lax and Draco\u2019s body settled back into the cushions, replete.\nHe climbed back onto the couch, settling himself next to Draco, whose eyes had closed. He put his head back and closed his own eyes.\n\u201cI liked this,\u201d he murmured. He heard a snort.\n\u201cI\u2019d be surprised if you didn\u2019t. It was a blow-job. No one doesn\u2019t like a blow-job.\u201d\nHarry frowned to himself. \u201cI liked it with you,\u201d he tried again.\n\u201cOf course you did. I\u2019m very good at then.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you are.\u201d Harry opened one eye and trained it on Draco. \u201cWhere did you practice?\u201d\n\u201cJealous, Potter?\u201d Draco said with a half-hearted sneer. He didn\u2019t bother lifting his head.\n\u201cI was Harry a minute ago,\u201d Harry said.\n\u201cYou had my cock in your mouth,\u201d Draco pointed out.\nExasperated, Harry drew a hand through his hair. It was no doubt standing up in every direction, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to care. \u201cI just mean, I thought \u2014 you know, we\u2019re getting to know each other and maybe like each other\u2026 I mean, I like you,\u201d Harry said, stumbling over the words. \u201cNow, I do. And I was mostly just wondering.\u201d\nFinally, Draco opened his eyes, his gaze disturbingly gentle. \u201cWanting each other and liking each other doesn\u2019t have to be synonymous, Harry.\u201d\nHarry felt deflated. \u201cThen what is this?\u201d\n\u201cFucking,\u201d Draco said succinctly. \u201cExcellently, of course, the way I do everything.\u201d\n\u201cAnd\u2026 that\u2019s what you want?\u201d Harry asked. Draco sighed.\n\u201cI want a lot of things. But, in regards to this\u2026 I\u2019d just like to keep doing this while we can, all right? We have a couple of more days. No need to get all Hufflepuff about it and start talking about our feelings. We can enjoy this for as long as we have it, if you can manage a little discretion.\u201d\nHarry thought suddenly about the Greengrass girl, about all of the expectations set upon Draco that he seemed so determined to live up to. Something else they had in common, he supposed. Though he\u2019d never been inclined to discuss his feelings at length, not even with Ron and Hermione, Harry inexplicably wanted to now \u2014 wanted to tell Draco how he\u2019d felt about Ginny and how that didn\u2019t compare to this. He wanted to say that everything he\u2019d seen inside Draco had helped him understand him better and had made him like Draco more and more. He wanted to ask if Draco could wait until things fell apart before closing the door on the possibility of more.\nInstead, he reached out and laced his fingers through Draco\u2019s. He was surprised to feel an answering squeeze.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go practice, then,\u201d he said quietly. Draco shot him a suspicious look through long, golden lashes.\n\u201cPractice what?\u201d\nHarry grinned. \u201cEverything. All of it.\u201d\n***\n\nDraco stands beside the cold, imposing figure of his father. He is supposed to walk forward now. He's supposed to do his duty and kneel in front of the Dark Lord, to take his Mark, but his knees are trembling too hard and his feet won\u2019t obey him. \n\n\nThe deformed figure in front of him raises a waiting hand and his father nudges him roughly in the shoulder. Feet dragging, he marches forward and gets on his knees. \n\n\nThe Dark Lord sweeps his wand negligently over Draco\u2019s sleeve and it tears cleanly up his forearm. He shudders, holding himself perfectly still, as icy fingers take his wrist in hand, turning his arm over to expose it. He feels like a rabbit in the jaws of a wolf. He breathes deep and tries to think himself away, anywhere, and suddenly sees a flash of green eyes in his mind. He wonders what he\u2019ll do if he\u2019s ordered to kill anyone.\n\n Anything, he thinks. Anything to protect Mother.\nHarry woke up with a start, heart beating fast. His stomach churned and his arms automatically closed around Draco, who was lying tight against him, eyelids fluttering, forehead wrinkled in distress. Unless he was mistaken, Harry felt certain he\u2019d just been inside of Draco\u2019s dream.\nHe thought about how rarely his dreams featured Voldemort anymore and felt a fiercd sweep of protective sadness at the thought of Draco being forced to make such choices to keep his mother alive. He wondered what he would have done, if he\u2019d been allowed to protect his own.\n\u201cDraco, wake up,\u201d Harry whispered, pressing a nipping kiss against his ear. Draco mumbled something and didn\u2019t wake, but the tension in his body eased and his mouth lost its tightness, curling into the vague shape of a smile.\nHarry kissed him again and this time Draco did wake up, blinking sleepy eyes up at him. Harry pressed a soft kiss against his mouth, opening up the link, flooding it with the way he trembled inside and Draco stroked his back with light hands, returning a feeling of permission and something that felt like relief.\nHarry scooted down in the bed. They had done this several times the previous night, but it felt new every time: touching and being touched, the slippery heat of Draco\u2019s mouth, the salty taste of his come when Harry returned the favor, the feeling of hands that weren\u2019t his own clutching at him, fumbling with excitement.\nThey had missed dinner downstairs, opting to lounge around in their quarters completely starkers \u2014 apparently once Draco was comfortable being naked, it was impossible to get him dressed again \u2014 so Harry had called for Kreacher, who was working in the kitchens while Harry finished school, and Kreacher had brought them sustenance while they practiced meditation, casting, and other things.\nThe casting had proceeded quite well. Both of them were able to use the other\u2019s magic to cast at this point, though it still caused a grating sort of itch in Harry and seemed to take much more out of Draco.\u00a0But Harry had been more interested in the deeper intimacy formed when they worked on meditating through their link, sharing the sort of secrets they had never spoken of to anyone else.\nHarry had allowed Draco complete access, even when he could sense he was delving into something private, but had strayed away from memories he\u2019d felt Draco wouldn\u2019t want him to see. Each time they looked into each other, the link had widened and flared, becoming stronger. Harry could sense Draco\u2019s emotions almost effortlessly now, unless Draco purposely closed off his side of internal communication.\nNow he sat and nestled his nose into the hair at Draco\u2019s groin, inhaling the musky scent there and nuzzling the underside of Draco cock. Draco hummed appreciatively, his fingers dipping into Harry\u2019s hair, and Harry took his burgeoning erection in his mouth, sucking hard.\nDraco gave a sharp, \u201cAh!\u201d and arched off the bed in surprise. Harry smiled around his cock and moved his head lower, mouthing his balls with a questing tongue and gentle lips, sucking softly. Draco opened his legs further and drew them up, resting the high arches of his feet on Harry\u2019s shoulders.\nImpulsively, Harry continued lowering his head. Draco was splayed open in front of him and Harry studied his arse intently for a moment. The crevice of it offered a long swath of pink skin and a furrowed little hole that attracted his interest and he remembered the the sharp lust that flooded him every time Draco\u2019s wet fingers trailed rings around him there.\nWithout letting himself think about it, Harry pressed his mouth against it, flicking his tongue out lightly. Draco made an incoherent sound, like wheezing and choking combined. Harry increased pressure, licking around the skin, then placing his lips over it and sucking gently. Draco arched again, jerking, and Harry clamped an arm across his hips to keep him in place. He continued sucking, relieved to taste nothing more offensive than the flavor of Draco\u2019s coconut soap.\nHis confidence increasing at the rough, abandoned sounds he could hear above him, Harry swirled his tongue around the tight hole and, feeling it loosen, stabbed into it tentatively. He did it again when Draco whined, a little harder, then again and again.\n\u201cPlease, please,\u201d Draco babbled breathlessly. Harry wondered vaguely what would happen if he added teeth to the mix, so he did, lightly scraping them over the wrinkled skin his tongue worked. Draco made a low, keening sound, his body strung tight like a bow, and Harry glanced up to see Draco's cock rising from his belly, throbbing and shooting spunk over Draco\u2019s fluttering stomach. \n\u201cHarry,\u201d Draco breathed. Harry looked up, saw Draco\u2019s astonished face, pupils blown so wide that his eyes looked black but for the faint silver rim around the edges. Harry crawled back up and kissed the corner of his mouth, smirking when Draco grimaced.\n\u201cI\u2019d prefer if you used a breath-freshening charm before you kiss me again,\u201d he said snottily, as if Harry hadn\u2019t just been able to make him come without touching his cock at all. Harry snorted, rubbing his erection over Draco\u2019s slowly withering cock in silent entreaty.\n\u201cCan I try something?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re full of ideas this morning,\u201d Draco grumbled, but there was a smile in his voice. Harry cast a quick, wandless charm to freshen his breath, and then kissed the other boy sloppily on the mouth. \u201cWhat do you want to try? Because I\u2019m probably not going to do that to you.\u201d\n\u201cProbably?\u201d Harry raised an eyebrow.\nDraco\u2019s lips quirked. \u201cWhat do you want, Potter?\u201d\n\u201cJust hold still.\u201d Harry reached out and swabbed a hand over the come still warm on Draco\u2019s stomach. He smeared it over his own aching cock and settled his hips between Draco\u2019s thighs. A mild sense of panic filled him, pushed through the link. Harry shook his head and said, \u201cNo, I wasn't going to-- Just\u2026\u201d\nHe slid his cock into the crevice of Draco\u2019s arse, the slide Draco's come and his own saliva creating a lubricant that had his eyes rolling back in his head. Draco, catching on, clenched his buttocks as Harry thrust back and forth in slow strokes between them.\nHarry rutted against him for a few minutes as Draco work his hips upward in time with Harry\u2019s thrusts, dizzily hearing Draco's soft, throaty encouragements. He rocked back and forth, pressing increasingly frantic kisses over Draco's neck and jaw, and began moving faster as he felt his balls tighten in response to the friction, his cock twitching and starting to spasm. Harry buried his face in Dracos throat and came hard, his vision turning gray at the edges, calling out Draco\u2019s name in a voice he didn\u2019t recognise.\nExhausted, he rested against Draco, He turned his head, cheek pressed against the elegant line of Draco's neck and felt the rapid tattoo of his heartbeat against it. He wandered his hands over the jut of Draco\u2019s hipbones, the slender protrusion of his ribs. He sent a wave of satisfaction through the link and felt, rather than saw, Draco\u2019s smile.\nThere was a sudden thunk behind him, followed by a squeak and a rather desolate sound of shock. Harry tugged up the bedsheets to cover them and rolled off Draco.\nRon and Hermione stood there. Ron\u2019s face was washed of all color. His wand was out and his mouth hung open wordlessly. Hermione\u2019s face, in contrast, was bright pink. She tugged on Ron\u2019s arm.\n\u201cI told you we should wait outside!\u201d she hissed.\nRon found his voice. \u201cI thought Malfoy was killing Harry! ...Why the fuck isn\u2019t Malfoy killing Harry?\u201d\nEmbarrassment crawled up Harry\u2019s spine, but it shared space with a burning sort of amusement. He rolled his eyes toward Draco, who was frozen in place, grey eyes huge.\n\u201cTo be fair,\u201d Harry pointed out practically, \u201cI\u2019m not indiscrete; they\u2019re just nosy.\u201d\nThat seemed to draw Draco out of his stunned state. He drew up the sheets haughtily and tucked them under his arms, glaring at Ron and Hermione.\u00a0 \u201cAnd I suppose you two don\u2019t have sex?\u201d\nIf possible, Hermione\u2019s face reddened even further.\nRon blustered for a moment. \u201cThat\u2019s none of your\u2014 That\u2019s not even\u2014 That\u2019s different!\u201d\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re a male and a female?\u201d Malfoy said coolly.\n\u201cBecause we\u2019re not Harry and Malfoy!\u201d Ron roared. \u201cBecause we\u2019re in love! What the fuck are you thinking, Harry?\u201d\nHarry shrugged, rather enjoying himself. \u201cWaste not, want not?\u201d\nDraco snickered.\nRon looked to be working himself into another fit of yelling, but Hermione stayed him with a sharp hand. \n\u201cNot now, Ron.\u201d She looked at Harry and Draco seriously. \u201cHonestly, Harry, we expect to hear about it later \u2014 probably best after Ron\u2019s a bit legless from drink \u2014 but we came here because we needed to talk to you both. It\u2019s fairly urgent. If you could, um, get, um, cleaned up and dressed? We\u2019ll wait out there,\u201d she said, jerking her head toward the other room. She tugged Ron out with her. He followed as though sleepwalking.\nFaintly, Harry heard Ron mumble, \u201cIt\u2019s a damn good thing you can Obliviate me, \u2018Mione.\u201d\n***\nThe silence was thick. Draco sat next to Harry, one arm slung over the back of the loveseat. Harry took a little comfort in every shift of his arm. Ron and Hermione stood across from them.\n\u201cSo you\u2019re telling me,\u201d Harry said, \u201cthat there\u2019s a potion that can resolve this?\u201d\nHe had mixed feelings on the matter. On one hand, despite the progress he and Draco had made with spell casting, he wanted his magic to be his own again. He didn\u2019t want to constantly have to make the effort to cast, to wonder if he was hurting Draco with every small spell, or to feel the resistant friction of Draco\u2019s magic against his own. On the other hand, the link had given him a depth of insight into Draco that he never would have had otherwise and though Draco insisted that it was nothing but fucking between them, Harry knew himself well enough, at least, to understand that it was more than that.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Hermione said emphatically. \u201cBut you\u2019re not listening. If it was just that, we wouldn\u2019t have\u2026 ah\u2026 interrupted you.\u201d\n\u201cWe were finished,\u201d Draco said with a cool raise of one eyebrow, forcing Harry to elbow him when he heard Ron make that distressed, wounded-Thestral noise again.\nHermione rolled her eyes but her face remained serious. \u201cThe problem is that you\u2019ll almost certainly die if you don\u2019t take it. You\u2019ll both, at the very least, weaken exponentially each day you\u2019ve gone without taking it after the original curse has broken. And the potion takes almost three days to brew!\u201d\n\u201cWell, we have just over two left,\u201d Draco pointed out but Harry, having finally caught up with what Hermione was talking them, barely heard him.\nHe felt a rush of hot betrayal flood through him. After everything, how could McGonagall not tell him that his life was in danger\u2014 again? \u201cHighlash specifically said that all we needed to do was work on our magic together and that the link would unravel as the curse did. He just told us we needed to stay magically strong, to explore the link\u2014\u201c\n\u201cSo I have Highlash to blame for this?\u201d Ron muttered. \u201cGreat.\u201d\n\u201cShut up, Ron,\u201d Harry snapped so viciously that Ron's head snapped up. Ron stared at him with wide, hurt eyes and whatever Hermione had been about to say faded rather quickly. Harry could feel Draco\u2019s confusion and concern nudge him through the link but he ignored it in favor of gripping Draco\u2019s wrist and hauling him off the sofa. \u201cCome on, we need to talk to McGonagall.\u201d\nHe led the way, not releasing Draco\u2019s wrist. Once they were out of the small stairway, Ron caught up with him, keeping in step.\n\u201cI mean, you know, it\u2019s a shock, is all,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cNot that you like blokes, it\u2019s that you like that one.\u201d\u00a0 Harry gave him a hard glare, still walking fast, and Ron held up his hands defensively. \u201cNot that it\u2019s any of my business who you go with, right. But, I mean, think how you\u2019d feel if you walked in on me and Hermione. And you actually like her\u2026\u201d\nDraco sighed next to him. He\u2019d quit trying to pull his wrist from Harry\u2019s grasp as they marched through the halls toward the Headmistresses office.\n\u201cNo need to worry, then, Weasel. He doesn\u2019t like me that way. We were just\u2026 taking advantage of an unfortunate circumstance.\u201d\n\u201cYou shut up, too,\u201d Harry growled. Draco squawked with indignation and Harry sped up.\nWhen they got to McGonagall\u2019s office, he spared grim thanks that his stupid special status meant that he was always allowed beyond her wards. He pulled Draco in with him and Ron and Hermione tumbled through the door soon after.\nMcGonagall was sitting at her desk, glasses perched low on the bridge of her nose as she worked over some parchment.\nShe looked up in surprise. \u201cPotter! What in Godric\u2019s name\u2026 Are you two all right?\u201d\nHarry dropped Draco\u2019s wrist. Draco rubbed it sullenly, shooting Harry a frown.\n\u201cI want to know why you didn\u2019t tell me we could die because of this or that there was a potion that could stop it,\u201d Harry said in a hard voice he was aware of never having used with her before. \u201cWhy you would deliberately keep that information from us\u2014from me! If nothing else, I\u2019ve earned the right to be aware that I could die again.\u201d\nProfessor McGonagall half-rose out of her chair, her mouth a little \u2018o\u2019 of surprise. \u201cI would never\u2014 Potter, what are you talking about?\u201d\nHarry scowled. \u201cHermione has been doing some research and found\u2014\u201c\n\u201cAh.\u201d Steadier now, McGonagall\u2019s gaze swerved to Hermione, who stood next on the other side of Harry, looking like she wanted the floor to swallow her. \u201cAnd if you could explain in more detail, Ms. Granger?\u201d\nHermione bit her lip. \u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d She dug through the bag she was holding and brought out a thick book titled Magical Medical Mysteries and Anomalies of the 20th Century. She stepped forward to offer it to the headmistress. \u201cPage 708.\u201d\nMcGonagall opened the book and flipped through to the correct page. She was quiet for several minutes and Harry watched her narrowly as she read. He could feel Draco nudging him through the link insistently, but he shook his head.\nFinally, McGonagall looked up. She turned to a portrait on her left. \u201cAmbrose, will you please contact the portraits on the east wing and let them know I\u2019m in urgent need of Professor Highlash to join me in my office at once?\u201d\nA wizard with a long, amber beard nodded once and disappeared from sight.\nMcGonagall sighed heavily. Her face was pursed into a strange expression of mingled regret and disapproval. \u201cPotter, I assure you that I had no foreknowledge of the incumbent dangers that accompany the bond between you and Mr. Malfoy other than what could happen if the two of you were separated or chose to use magic against one another,\u201d she said, her voice low. \u201cWhile it was perhaps a mistake to trust in Professor Highlash\u2019s intended course of action, I did receive owls from St. Mungo\u2019s -- as well as from the Ministry -- which attested to his expertise on this matter.\u201d\nHarry\u2019s heart pounded fiercely. His throat constricted and he felt the sudden, awful urge to cry. He swallowed it back. \u201cProfessor\u2014\u201c\n\u201cFurthermore, Potter, I\u2019m surprised that you would ever think me capable of such a thing, particularly when it comes to your \u2014 or any student\u2019s \u2014 safety,\u201d she continued.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to say, I believe that\u2019s my fault, Minerva,\u201d came a quiet voice over her shoulder. Harry looked up.\nMcGonagall turned around. \u201cAlbus?\u201d\n\u201cHarry might feel a little\u2026 predisposed, shall we say, to jump to conclusions about his mentors\u2019 ulterior motives in regards to his health and security,\u201d Dumbledore explained from his portrait. His pale blue eyes were filled with regret and Harry felt a sting from the truth of his words. \u201cAnd that, of course, is my doing. Although I have apologized for it sincerely and believe myself to be forgiven, such poor treatment from someone so trusted is bound to leave a lasting mark. I hope you will take that into consideration when pondering Harry\u2019s outburst.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026I\u2026 Of course, Albus.\u201d McGonagall looked confused.\n\u201cMr. Malfoy,\u201d Dumbledore said out of nowhere. Draco, who had been standing rigidly still since Harry had begun yelling at the headmistress, jerked and looked around swiftly, as if searching for an escape.\n\u201cYes, Sir?\u201d he said reluctantly./p&gt;\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you again,\u201d Dumbledore said. \u201cYou\u2019re looking much\u2026 better.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, Sir.\u201d\n\u201cI find time can do that, to a person,\u201d Dumbledore continued, his voice taking on a bland, relaxed quality. \u201cTime can do a lot of things.\u201d\nHarry and Draco exchanged a swift look.\n\u201cYes, it can,\u201d Harry said quietly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Professor. If I\u2019d taken time to think about it, I would have known that you wouldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d\nMcGonagall shook her head. \u201cYes, you would have,\u201d she said severely. Her face softened. \u201cBut I suppose it can be excused. Although Professor Dumbledore and I will be having a talk about it, later.\u201d\nDumbledore coughed behind her.\nHighlash bustled in and stopped, looking around at the group of people glaring in his direction. \u201cI was told you needed me, Headmistress?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said, her eyes narrowed. She stood with her spine ramrod straight, an imposing figure behind her massive desk. \u201cI believe everyone here is wondering why you didn\u2019t reveal that there was a simple potion solution to the binding of Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy\u2019s magical cores? As well as why you didn\u2019t bother to explain the severity of the consequences if they didn\u2019t take this potion?\u201d\nHighlash looked about wildly Harry felt a deep, gnawing anger streak through him but Draco gave another frantic nudge to the link and finally Harry opened up his side of it, relaxing at the reassurance that he was't alone. \u201cI\u2026I\u2026 I wasn\u2019t aware of such a thing,\u201d Highlash protested.\nMcGonagall picked up the book on her desk. \u201cSo I\u2019m incorrect in saying that you wrote this?\u201d\nHighlash\u2019s face turned an interesting shade of red. \u201cThe ah, potion takes only three days to brew. I was on my way to speak with Professor Slughorn when I heard that you wanted to see me.\u201d\n\u201cThree days,\u201d McGonagall repeated flatly. \u201cAnd yet, they have two left. And I believe your book states that there could be lasting effects from the link if the potion isn\u2019t taken within the first five days upon being cursed?\u201d\nProfessor Highlash wilted. He looked at Harry earnestly and Harry felt a crawl of disgust.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d Highlash breathed, eyes filled with a strange light. \u201cWhat this could do for our knowledge of Core Magic. You two are a perfect case study. I only wanted to\u2014\u201c\n\u201cA perfect what!\u201d McGonagall cried out, startling all of them. \u201cYou\u2019ve been using Malfoy and Potter for research?\u201d\nHighlash continued to address Harry, speaking faster, his voice dropping to a whisper as though not everyone in the room could hear him. \u201cYou were never meant to be a part of it. And Draco Malfoy, he\u2019s a Death E\u2014\u201c\nHarry Stunned Professor Highlash so quickly he didn\u2019t have recollection of pulling his wand from his pocket. He automatically lent Draco\u2019s power to his ownas he cast, his ears filled with such a roaring sound that he didn\u2019t know if it came from the Stun blast or his own fury as the professor shot back with the force of his hex. Highlash slammed into the bookshelf against the far wall and thudded to the ground. Books toppled on top of him.\n\u201cPotter!\" McGonagall shouted. \u201cYou will put away your wand at once!\u201d\nGrudgingly, still glaring, he did. \u201cHe just admitted that he had something to do with Draco getting cursed,\u201d Harry said, not feeling even a little bad.\n\u201cBe that as it may,\u201d Professor McGonagall said with clear exasperation. She pointed her wand at the now-inert form of Highlash and said, \u201cPetrificus Totalus,\u201d then turned back to them again. \u201cI will be alerting the Aurors and will keep you informed of what we find out. I will also be speaking to Professor Slughorn. You two will have that potion as soon as it is fully brewed.\n\u201cMs. Granger, thank you for bringing this to everyone\u2019s attention. Twenty points to Gryffindor. Mr. Malfoy, I appreciate you keeping a level head; twenty points to Slytherin as well. Now please, all of you \u2014 Mr. Weasley, have you been here this whole time? \u2014 leave my office at once,\u201d she finished, her voice brooking no argument.\nThey filed out. Harry risked a quick glance back as he and Draco left and caught McGonagall staring down angrily at Highlash\u2019s frozen body. When she glanced back up, Harry could have sworn she shot him a satisfied smirk.\nEveryone was talking over each other.\nAfter climbing back up to their rooms, Harry just wanted to sleep, but Ron and Hermione had trudged after them. After a few minutes of listening to them talk over each other, Draco had tugged on Harry\u2019s sleeve and Harry\u2019d turned to him questioningly.\n\u201cSince it doesn\u2019t look like we\u2019re set to be alone for a while,\u201d Draco said dryly, \u201cwould you mind sending a Patronus to Pansy to join us? It doesn\u2019t seem hard for you and I haven\u2019t been able to produce one.\u201d\nSurprised not only by the request but also by the ease with which Draco admitted something he probably considered to be a weakness, Harry cast his Patronus quickly and they had been joined by Pansy, who huffed, \"Salazar's sake, I feel like my father when you call me Parkinson.\" She'd brought Blaise because \"it\u2019d be fun,\" and, and Blaise leered and told Harry to call him whatever he wanted.\nNow everyone was arguing over what should be done about Highlash. Pansy was vying for a poisoned potion, Blaise thought Harry, Ron, and Hermione should use their status to get him sent straight to Azkaban for daring to secretly run tests on the Chosen One without permission, Hermione kept arguing that more research would help, Ron kept darting threatening glances at Draco \u2014 and no one would let them speak.\n\u201cOiy!\u201d Harry finally yelled, fed up. \u201cWe\u2019re here, you know!\u201d\nMalfoy shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s no use, Potter. Pansy\u2019s as bad as Granger when she gets on about something.\u201d\n\u201cNo one is as bad as Granger,\u201d Pansy said, offended.\n\u201cI am not bad when I get on about something,\u201d Hermione huffed. \u201cI\u2019m just\u2026 thorough. Which is a good thing, because it\u2019s not as if your lot has been doing anything for the two of them!\u201d\n\u201cOur lot?\u201d Blaise arched a dark eyebrow and flashed a sly sort of smile.\n\u201cWell, you know\u2026 M\u2014 Draco\u2019s friends,\u201d Hermione said, flustered.\n\u201cWell, we have so, as a matter of fact,\u201d Pansy said, put out. \u201cI was going to talk to him about it at dinner last night, but they didn\u2019t show up. And then again at breakfast, when they didn\u2019t show up. Speaking of which, why didn\u2019t you show up?\u201d she asked.\nRon coughed.\n\u201cWe were working,\u201d Draco said. To his credit, he didn\u2019t blush at all. Harry couldn\u2019t claim the same, heat rising fast in his cheeks. He wondered how noticeable it was.\n\u201cMmmhmm.\u201d Pansy glanced between them speculatively. \u201cI see.\u201d\n\u201cWait, what have you been doing?\u201d Hermione asked curiously.\n\u201cResearch. I do know how, you know.\u201d\nAt Hermione\u2019s gaping expression, Malfoy grimaced. \u201cIt\u2019s true. She\u2019s top in our House in classes.\u201d\n\u201cAmong other things,\u201d Blaise said with a grin. Pansy elbowed him in the ribs.\n\u201cWell, what did you find?\u201d Hermione pressed.\n\u201cA footnote in Blood Magic and Mystical Curses,\u201d Pansy said, throwing herself down dramatically into the squashy chair to the side of the loveseat. \u201cHorrible, dodgy old book written in the 1700\u2019s. It was a nightmare to get through. It made reference to a case of Core connectivity, just mentioned in passing, but the footnote said that these types of curses tend to have lingering effects if they aren\u2019t treated immediately.\u201d\n\u201cI found something like that, too,\u201d Hermione said quietly, looking like she was trying not to be impressed. \u201cFrom a different book.\u201d\n\u201cWhat kind of lingering effects?\u201d Draco asked.\n\u201cYeah, what kind?\u201d Ron said, with another suspicious glance at the two of them. Harry resisted the urge to put his arm around Draco just to shine him on.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t say,\u201d Pansy said. She shrugged. \u201cI was going to ask what Highlash said about it but I guess that Thestral has flown now, right?\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Harry, depressed. Okay, so they probably weren\u2019t going to die now that they knew they needed a potion. They had found out in proper time, after all. Buy the term lingering effects resonated through Harry\u2019s head. Of course there would be lingering effects.\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Draco said when the silence lasted more than a single second. \u201cDespite Hogwarts having obviously not learned to do thorough mental background checks on its teachers yet, Highlash was right in that we need to maintain a strong connection to be able to untangle the link, yes?\u201d\nHermione bit her lip. \u201cBased on everything I\u2019ve read, yes. The potion should do it for you, but each of you needs to be able to identify your Cores clearly to best be able to\u2014 to unwind them.\u201d\n\u201cThen you all need to get out,\u201d Draco said flatly.\n\u201cWe could, help?\u201d Hermione said. \u201cMonitor? I\u2019ve read it could be quite dangerous\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been so far,\u201d Harry said. Then, looking at Ron, \u201cMalfoy and I do it best alone.\u201d\nRon flushed, but there was an answering twitch around the corners of his mouth.\n\u201cReally, Draco, I always knew you wanted to be alone with Potter but that\u2019s just rude.\u201d Pansy sniffed and picked her bookbag up from the floor.\n\u201cIt\u2019s necessary,\u201d Draco hissed. The sneaky smile slipped off Pansy's face. \u201cIt\u2019s necessary for us to get out of this disgusting curse, so can you please just all bugger off now?\u201d\nBlaise and Pansy exchanged glances and disappeared through the door.\n\u201cI\u2019ll keep looking,\u201d Hermione promised. She tugged on Ron\u2019s arm. \u201cCome on, Ronald.\u201d\nRon resisted. He stared at Harry and Draco and, after a beat, walked up to them. He addressed Harry. \u201cI reckon if you like him enough to\u2026 To\u2026 Well, if you like him enough, there must be something likable to\u2026 like. And, I mean, I\u2019d always support you, so\u2014\u201c He thrust a hand out, almost hitting Draco in the nose with it. Draco cringed backward to avoid getting smacked and placed his own hand unenthusiastically in Ron\u2019s grasp.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry so much about it, Weasley. And definitely don\u2019t bring it up with anyone else,\u201d Draco said, disconcerted. \u201cIt\u2019s not a lasting thing.\u201d\n\u201cStill.\u201d Ron gave Draco\u2019s hand three even shakes, then released it and wiped his palm against his pants.\nHermione was watching from the door, her face rather misty. \u201cOh, Ron,\u201d Harry heard her say as they left together.\nThe door swung shut behind them and Harry sagged against the cushions. Draco swung himself up and over, straddling Harry\u2019s lap, grinding his erection against Harry\u2019s stomach. Harry drew back, startled. \u201cWhat are you doing? How long have you had that?\u201d\n\u201cSince you Stunned Highlash,\u201d Draco murmured against Harry\u2019s jaw, catching Harry\u2019s earlobe between his teeth. \u201cI\u2019ve always found these robes useful, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cEr, yes.\u201d\nDraco caught his mouth in a hard kiss. Harry felt his own cock twitch and begin to lengthen, and he kissed Draco back. After a minute, he pulled away. \u201cI actually was planning on sleeping a bit before lunch. We didn\u2019t get much last night.\u201d Desire pulsed at him through the link. \u201cBut, you know, that can probably wait.\u201d\n\u201cYou,\u201d Draco said succinctly, catching Harry\u2019s eyes as he loosened his own tie, \u201care going to fuck me now.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014 I am?\u201d\n\u201cYou are.\u201d Draco pulled away to lean over and drag a thin book from where it was buried deep in the cushions of the sofa. The cover had a man and a woman writhing on it. They kept changing positions. \u201cI nicked this from Pansy\u2019s bag. She always carries it with her.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Harry asked, confused. It was a man and a woman, after all. Draco grimaced, staring down at the cover. As they watched, the man rolled so the woman was on top of him. He cupped his hands over her bare breasts.\n\u201cShe showed it to me fourth year. It was one of the first things that made me admit that I was\u2026 Well. But there\u2019s an interesting incantation in it for lubricant -- I just couldn\u2019t remember what it was.\u201d\nDraco began flipping through the pages, his hips still doing filthy things on top of Harry as he casually perused the book. Harry fought to pay attention. He rolled his hips up, hissing at the friction.\n\u201cWait, that\u2019s why you wanted her here?\u201d\n\u201cI always suspected you weren\u2019t as thick as you looked.\u201d He arched a wicked brow and snickered, pressing down against Harry\u2019s swollen cock. \u201cWell, as stupid. Here it is.\u201d\n\u201cAre you sure you want to do that? Just a couple of hours ago, you\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d Draco pulled off his tie and began on the rest of his things. \u201cI\u2019ll let you do that thing with your tongue again.\u201d\n\u201cLet me.\" Harry snickered, fingers working fast over his own buttons. He removed his shirt and shoved Draco off of him to stand and pull off the rest of his clothes. Draco shimmied out of his pants as well and dragged him into the bedroom, pushing Harry onto the bed and climbing back on top of him. Harry groaned at the feel of Draco\u2019s cock against his own, stuff and already damp at the tip. He grabbed a fistful of white-blond hair and dragged Draco\u2019s face down for a kiss, pressing his tongue inside Draco's mouth, tasting the cinnamon of Draco\u2019s preferred breath potion.\nDraco ground against him, fingers drifting lightly over Harry\u2019s nipples. Harry felt a startling twinge in his cock at the sensation.\n\u201cRoll over,\u201d he muttered.\nDraco complied, letting Harry push him onto his back, and Harry scooted down the bed until he was at eye-level with Draco\u2019s prick. Harry circled it with a light hand and gave it a gentle squeeze. Draco moaned above him. Keeping his hand where it was, Harry lowered his head further. Draco lifted his knees eagerly, reaching down to open his arse cheeks further and Harry huffed a laugh against the Draco's crease, nosing along it.\n\u201cLet me,\u201d he said again, pushing amusement across the link. Harry felt an answering blast of excitement that would have felled him if he'd not aready been laying down. Instead, he leaned in and pressed a strong lick over Draco\u2019s arse, lapping at the hole firmly until Draco was writhing again, tiny squealing grunt issuing from his throat. Draco's hole softened under Harry's tongue, the muscles of his sphincter turning swollen and loose, and after a few minutes, Harry gave a soft nip to the crinkled flesh and lifted his head. \u201c\nAre you sure\u2026?\u201d \nIn answer, Draco curled his fingers in Harry\u2019s hair and yanked him up. He grabbed Harry\u2019s hand and scrambled for his wand. Finding it, he dipped the tip of it into Harry\u2019s palm and muttered an incantation. Slick oil filled Harry\u2019s hand and he looked down at it nervously.\n\u201cErm, how do I\u2026 I mean, I\u2019ve never\u2026 Have you?\u201d\nDraco met his eyes. \u201cNo,\u201d he admitted. \u201cNot this. But\u2026 we\u2019ll just keep the link open and you\u2019ll know if anything goes wrong.\u201d\nRelieved, Harry applied the oil to his fingers. He found Draco\u2019s entrance and slipped a finger inside; Draco closed his eyes and pushed into the feeling. Harry tried another, which went in rather easily as well. Harry pumped his fingers for a few moments, mind focused on Draco's tightness, his heat, until Draco\u2019s eyes fluttered open. \u201cDo it.\u201d\nTaking a deep breath, Harry coated his cock with the oil and settled between Draco\u2019s thighs. He wasn\u2019t sure why but when he\u2019d thought about, it he\u2019d always assumed one of them would have to be on their stomach and he decided he preferred this much better. He concentrated on the link as he lined himself up. Despite Draco\u2019s desire and eagerness, he was nervous too and Harry could feel the deep amount of trust Draco had in him. He sent across his own nervousness, his own excitement, and felt Draco\u2019s fingers grip his waist as he pushed inside, just a little. Draco squirmed under him, but Harry could feel through the link that it felt\u2026 good. A little strange and confusing, but definitely good.\nHarry worked his cock in slowly, stopping whenever Draco sent him a wave of discomfort until he felt the signal that it was okay again. And then there was nowhere to go; he was finally seated completely inside of him.\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d he whispered, holding still even as his cock throbbed dangerously.\nDraco\u2019s brow was as slick with sweat as Harry\u2019s. He nudged his arse up tentatively and Harry bit back a gasp. \u201cJust move, I guess. However feels good.\u201d\nHarry pulled out a little and then thrust back. \u201cOh, Jesus and Merlin,\u201d he breathed.\nDraco\u2019s arse was silky with oil and so tight around him he worried this would all be over before it really got started. He'd never imagined anything like it. He sent the feeling through the link and Draco\u2019s body, which had tightened up at Harry\u2019s thrust, relaxed a little. He began stroking his cock in and out of Draco carefully. Draco's knee slid up his waist and Harry caught it under his forearm, opening him up further.\n\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Draco muttered raggedly, eyes screwed shut. \u201cFeels good. Feels really good.\u201d\nHarry took a moment to read the sensations Draco was sending across. Whenever Harry slid in and up, a wave of hot pleasure spiked through Draco. He adjusted his angle, rising higher on his knees, and started rocking steadily. Draco made a raw sound deep in his throat and Harry let the link subside, unable to focus on so many sensations at once. He mindlessly reached between them, finding Draco\u2019s prick and gripping it tight as he pumped his hips to get deeper. He worked his fist in time over Draco and fucked him faster, Draco's fingers digging into Harrys ribs as he rocked up to meet his thrusts and then Draco cried out sharply. His body heaved and his cock began to spurt over Harry's fingers, covering them in wet, sticky streaks.\nAs Draco climaxed, his body tightened, slick inner muscles gripping Harry's cock with such intensity that he felt his balls draw up against his body, felt the orgasm rip its way down his spine to his aching prick. With his last coherent thought, Harry opened up the link so that Draco could feel what he felt as he came.\n I love you, he thought into the void of it, and finished.\n***\n\u201cWhy did you say you had died,\u201d Draco wondered aloud, voice sex-drugged and sleepy. Draco head rested on Harry\u2019s chest, his hand splayed across the flat of Harry\u2019s abdomen while Harry played idly with his hair.\n\u201cI did.\u201d\n\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t. My mother told me; you were alive in the forest,\u201d Draco said, sounding marginally more awake.\nHarry gave a jaw-cracking yawn. \u201cI came back. I was\u2026 I guess, given the option to? It\u2019s hard to explain. But no, I died.\u201d\nDraco looked up, eyes wide and startled. \u201cHow doesn\u2019t everyone know about this?\u201d\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s not as if I\u2019m going to run to the Prophet about it, is it?\u201d Harry said practically. \u201cAnd everyone who was there knew I\u2019d given myself up to Voldemort without fighting -- I announced that part in the middle of the Hall.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026 So you actually died?\u201d Draco asked in a strange voice.\nHarry rubbed a hand over his face uncomfortably, wondering where his glasses had got off to. He couldn\u2019t remember having removed them. \u201cErm, yeah. Sort of.\u201d\n\u201cDo Granger and Weasley know?\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Draco echoed. He was silent for such a long time, Harry thought he had dropped the subject, but eventually he said, \u201cBut they weren\u2019t there with you.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cYou were by yourself. My mother told me.\u201d\n\u201cSort of,\u201d Harry said again, awkwardly. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018sort of?\u2019\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain.\u201d\nThere was another long silence. When Draco spoke again, it was with the tremble of hesitation in his voice. \u201cCan I see?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry blurted, shocked.\n\u201cCan you show me? I think if you focused on the memory, I could find it fairly easily.\u201d Draco shrugged, almost nonchalantly, but there was a fine tremor of tension in his hands, which had folded to grip the sheet over them tightly.\nHarry thought about it. To give Draco this memory would be trusting him with more than aspects of himself, Harry knew; it would be giving him a working knowledge of dangerous things like Horcruxes and Hallows -- secrets that were never meant to be shared. It meant showing him Dumbledore\u2019s betrayal, however imperative, and his own uncertainty over how he wanted to proceed at King\u2019s Cross. It meant sharing fear and pain and hope and all of those matters that rarely got talked about, in a way that would give Draco a lot of ammunition if he ever chose to use it.\n\u201cYes, all right,\u201d Harry whispered.\nThe thing of it was, he didn\u2019t know if they could send actual focused thoughts \u2014 beyond sensations or emotions \u2014 through the link, but what he had tried to tell Draco had been real. It was fast, he knew, but he\u2019d fallen in love in a way he hadn\u2019t thought possible after the War, after Ginny, after so many years of terror and disappointment. That it was with someone Harry had once considered his enemy just seemed to make it more special. Draco hadn\u2019t responded to his sentiments in one way or another, but that didn\u2019t make them any less true.\n\u201cReally?\u201d Draco said sceptically.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t tell anyone,\u201d Harry warned. \u201cEver.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2014 I wouldn\u2019t. I won\u2019t,\u201d Draco said, eyes wide.\n\u201cReally, Draco.\u201d\nDraco nodded somberly and Harry settled back onto the pillows with a heavy sigh. Draco put his head back down on Harry\u2019s chest and Harry closed his eyes and thought of the Forbidden Forest, of Voldemort\u2019s scarlet eyes, of that flash of green and the calm, misty train station. He deliberately thought of all of those things that he\u2019d fought so hard not to think about for so many months and as he felt the pull of Draco wandering around inside of his magic and accessing everything that made Harry who he was, he finally allowed his mind to wander.\nHe found himself surrounded by feathers again and he sighed with the peaceful relief of it as he followed them to the pool. He looked down at it nervously. Unlike his previous visits, the water was turbulent and dark. Because of what Draco was experiencing through him? he wondered.\nHarry glided into the water and the waves eased at his presence. He ducked his head under the surface and began to swim. All of the memories that surrounded him, all the colours of the water, had gone murky and frightened. Harry took a deep breath and grabbed one in deep gray, closing his fingers around it.\nDraco was in Azkaban, huddled into the corner of a tiny stone cell with magic-repelling wards over the metal bars. There was a filthy basin in the corner next to an even filthier toilet. On the floor in front of him was the thin mat of a cot. Draco had taken the worn blanket and wrapped himself in it, shivering miserably. Harry looked around; the Dementors had been removed by Azkaban by Draco\u2019s short stay, but Harry could still feel their influence seeping from the walls, the entire room sucking everything happy and hopeful out of him. Harry took another look at Draco, whose face had grown angular and sharp from lack of food and noticed he\u2019d begun to weep silently, burying his face in his arms.\nHarry released the memory, breathing shallowly, in quick pants.\nHe plucked another at random, in a rather sickly green-yellow and was suddenly in Malfoy Manor, watching Draco stare at Harry\u2019s own swollen, unrecognizable face with complete and total recognition. Draco shook his head, mouthing, \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d silently, but in a voice that Harry would always be able to clearly recall, and rose to walk quickly away, turning his back to Memory-Harry. He and Ron were quickly dragged downstairs and Hermione was led to the middle of the room. Draco sat down heavily and tried to avoid looking at the scene in front of him, but Hermione\u2019s writhing was so intense, her face so filled with torment that he palmed his wand in a hand slick with sweat and eyed Bellatrix with timid consideration. His mother rested a hand on his shoulder and, reminded of her precarious safety, the fear became too great. He slid his wand away, unseen. He swallowed hard around the lump growing in his throat as Hermione was cursed, as she screamed and screamed. Everything remained silent as Harry watched, but his mind furnished him with the sound of Hermione's anguish, something else he would never forget.\nHarry opened his hand and watched the memory swim away, much to his relief. He grabbed another, and another, and another, filling in the blanks for Draco\u2019s sixth and seventh years. He saw Draco watch him with utter relief, a loosening in his chest as Voldemort fell in the Great Hall, saw him unable to Crucio hostages at Malfoy Manor until he had been given proper incentive by Bellatrix using him as an example over and over. Harry saw him bring extra food to Luna in the dungeon, felt Draco's strange shot of pride as Neville stood up to the Carrows for torturing a second year student, and saw Draco\u2019s silent yell of \u201cPOTTER!\u201d get lost amongst the screams of Harry\u2019s friends as Hagrid carried Harry\u2019s limp form back to the castle.\nHarry was so involved in the deepest, ugliest memories that Draco had that it was jarring to realise he was being shaken rather hard. \u201cHarry\u2014Harry!\u201d he heard distantly and then, in a yell, \u201cPotter, get the fuck out of my head!\u201d\nHarry jerked back into himself, a scene of Draco burying his face in the back of Harry\u2019s smoky shirt as they raced away from Fiendfyre dissolving rapidly. Draco was looking at him with irritation that Harry mollified by reaching up to press a soft kiss against his mouth.\n\u201cMerlin, you\u2019re thick,\u201d Draco mumbled. \u201cI was trying to pull you out of that for over a minute. Where were you?\u201d\n\u201cSixth and seventh year,\u201d Harry told him.\nDraco\u2019s jaw tightened.\u00a0 \u201cAnd I suppose you needed to?\u201d\n\u201cI think about as much as you did,\u201d Harry said. He paused. \u201cWell?\u201d\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t\u2026 It kept skipping around. I didn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cBut now you see why,\u201d Harry said.\n\u201cNow I see why,\u201d Malfoy confirmed, biting his lip. \u201cI really won\u2019t tell.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Harry said, looking steadily into Draco\u2019s glassy eyes, which. He pushed his knowledge through the link and, for emphasis, said, \u201cI trust you.\u201d\n***\nThey spent the weekend in bed, wrapped around each other, alternately fucking and meditating. Draco seemed almost afraid to leave their rooms whenever Harry suggested it, so they didn\u2019t. Harry sent a Patronus to McGonagall, explaining that they were fine and were working on being able to better access their Cores for when the potion was ready. McGonagall's silver tabbies returned to explain that Highlash was under guard at the Ministry and that they would be furnished with more answers by the time the potion was ready on Monday night. Slughorn had managed to find some Delorant Beetle wings, she said, which had sped up the brewing process by a day, and there should be no ill-effects on either Harry or Draco\u2019s magic. She also excused them from classes on Monday and commended them for working so well together, which made Draco cackle until tears were rolling down his cheeks, and Harry blush \u2014 something he was surprised he could still do at this point.\nThey got dressed only when they invited Hermione, Ron, Pansy and Blaise up to their rooms each night to talk for an hour or so before curfew. Harry didn\u2019t feel right just ignoring his friends and Draco pointed out that it was only fair if his friends were invited too. Truthfully, Harry wasn\u2019t bothered by it -- he found Draco truly amusing when he was snarky and he tended to adopt that attitude the most whenever he was surrounded by his friends. He had even managed to curb his insults to level acceptable to Harry\u2019s friends. More than once, Harry had caught Ron trying not to laugh at one of Draco\u2019s jokes, which could be surprisingly bawdy.\nHarry figured it was the principle of the thing.\nWhen their friends left, their clothes would come off and Harry would find himself rather quickly on his knees in front of Draco, or panting above him, Draco's legs locked around his hips, or thrusting into Draco\u2019s hot mouth, or bent over the end of the sofa as Draco worked him open with his fingers before fucking him. He\u2019d been nervous about that one but they had left the link open again and once Draco had figured out the tempo and angles that felt best to Harry, there had been no stopping either of them.\u00a0Harry couldn\u2019t think of anything they hadn\u2019t done. Nothing seemed off-limits and they got as creative as possible, even modifying ideas from Pansy\u2019s book on more than one occasion.\nHarry was sore everywhere, inside and out, was dehydrated and exhausted, and at times his cock was so sensitive, he felt raw and he wasn\u2019t sure how he could even manage to get hard again. But he did, over and over, persuaded by Draco\u2019s hands or mouth or arse being washed in the shower, or even just a certain glint in Draco's eyes that never seemed to go away. Swayed by his laughter and easy smiles and smirks and the smell of coconuts on his hair.\nIt occurred to Harry that they were two perspectives of one mind about it: Draco seemed to want to try everything, as he was determined to make sure that their arrangement was dissolved when their Cores were untangled, and Harry wanted to try everything, equally determined to prove to him that it didn\u2019t need to be.\nAnd whenever they were sticky with drying sweat and come, temporarily unable to do anything but wheeze heavily into a mattress with sheets that had been torn half-off, they would close their eyes and slip into each other\u2019s minds.\nDraco had asked him to be able to look at his life with the Dursleys, which Harry had allowed in exchanged for being able to rifle through Draco\u2019s memories of his father. Those were confusing. Lucius obviously loved his son, but so much of their relationship was filled with sharp angles: Harry saw the easily demonstrated affection from Draco\u2019s earlier years slowly replaced by a cold expectation that left Draco bewildered and at loose ends for how to please him. And although he didn\u2019t discuss what he had seen from Harry\u2019s childhood, Draco began refilling Harry\u2019s plate when he was done, much like Molly did whenever he was at the Burrow, telling him he needed to \u201ckeep his strength up.\u201d Harry watched Dumbledore\u2019s death through a different lens, saw the Headmaster fall and felt the intense churn of shame inside of Draco, both for lowering his wand and raising it in the first place. He saw Snape giving Draco lessons in Potions when he was eight, saw Draco walking in Paris with his mother when he was twelve, saw him wrestling with a half-dressed Theo Nott in the Slytherin showers at fifteen, and saw him sit at a table while Voldemort killed a woman and let Greyback savage her in seventh year.\nHe got out of the last two quickly.\nIn turn, Draco explored Harry\u2019s memories of Ginny \u2014 \u201cRedheads are too much trouble, anyway,\u201d he\u2019d sniffed, then goaded Harry to fuck him hard into the mattress \u2014 his disastrous memories of Cho, Cedric's death, and Harry's, cold, desolate winter in the Forest of Dean.\nThey rarely commented their thoughts on each other\u2019s memories other than to let the other know what they wanted to look at or had seen, but Harry understood completely how Draco\u2019s primary Elements were Water and Air. He was clever and adaptable to any circumstance, logical to the bone, and cunning and resourceful in the face of terrifying odds despite the fear that often led him to make horrible choices. He was loyal and loving and frustrating and persistant and in no time at all it felt like he was completely necessary for Harry to continue to breathe.\nOn Monday, Harry woke up to the delightfully warm, wet sensation of Draco\u2019s mouth surrounding his cock. The crown of it brushed the back of Draco\u2019s throat. Harry gasped and placed a lazy hand over Draco\u2019s hair, shining white-gold in the sunlight pouring through the window.\nDraco continued bobbing his head up and down in slow strokes, carefully reaching between Harry\u2019s legs to find his arshole and breach it with two slick fingers in one smooth motion that made Harry arch off the bed and hiss, \u201cMerlin, Draco, fuck!\u201d\nHe felt the vibration of a warm, dirty laugh around him and he thrust up helplessly against Draco\u2019s calculated tongue -- much better when used for these sorts of nasty purposes, Harry thought disjointedly. Draco continued working his fingers in and out of Harry and reached up with his free hand, cradling Harry\u2019s balls and giving them a gentle squeeze before circling his cock, tugging around the base of it in perfect rhythm with the slide of his mouth.\n\u201cPlease,\u201d Harry gasped. \u201cI want you inside me.\u201d\nDraco pulled his mouth away, grey eyes ablaze, face hungry. He prowled up the length of Harry\u2019s body to kiss him hotly and at Harry\u2019s jaw, scraped his teeth over Harry\u2019s exposed neck. He lined himself up and pushed into Harry slowly, rocking back and forth until he was deeply embedded and Harry could feel Draco's balls resting against his arse. He squirmed, caught like a fish on a hook, adjusting to the burn of penetration, of being stretched wide, invaded in the best possible way. He reached down and fisted his cock slowly, stroking his foreskin back, using Draco's saliva as a lubricant, as Draco fuckdd in and out of him.\nDraco stared down in between them to where their bodies were joined, breathing raggedly, and Harry watched as his face changed, became tense with longing. He wanked himself and wrapped a calf around the back of Draco\u2019s thigh, feeling the rough scattering of hair there bristle against his own. Draco looked up, arms braced on either side of Harry\u2019s head.\nTheir eyes locked. Time stilled. Draco slid closer to him, and the angle of his prick buried deep brushed that bundle of nerves inside Harry. Harry felt his face twist but refused to close his eyes. Draco\u2019s face was unbearably, unbelievably tender, almost broken as he stared into Harry, who felt like he was being accessed without aid of the link, felt like Draco\u2019s magic was his own and his was Draco\u2019s. Draco looked away and the moment cracked in two.\nDraco picked up speed, deepening his thrusts with hard snaps of his hips and Harry jerked his cock eagerly, feverishly, as his orgasm built. Then he was coming over his fingers, all over his stomach and Draco\u2019s too, and Draco gasped and ground his cock deep. His fingers pressed tight into Harry's jaw and he slanted his mouth over Harry's, hips stuttering, to kiss him ferociously. He groaned Harry's name against his lips and he spilled wetly inside him.\nDraco rested against him, panting hard and Harry took a long inhale of Draco\u2019s hair. It smelled like sweat and shampoo, and Harry suddenly, inexplicably, felt like crying.\nDraco disengaged their bodies gently and rolled off of him. \u201cI think we should go to classes today,\u201d he said at length, breat still coming light and quick.\n\u201cWhy? We were excused.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s already enough gossip about what\u2019s been going on up here,\u201d Draco said curtly. \u201cWe should go to classes and meals like normal. We\u2019ll take the potion this evening and be done with it.\u201d\n\u201cDraco\u2026\u201d Harry felt adrift, off-kilter.\n\u201cCome on, let\u2019s get ready,\u201d Draco clipped out. \u201cBreakfast is in twenty.\u201d\nHarry followed him out of bed, baffled. He knew he hadn\u2019t imagined what had just happened between them, but had no idea how to convince Draco that it had.\n***\nThey made it to breakfast and sat at the Gryffindor table just as the food was appearing. Hermione looked at each of them and reached over to tap three different places under Harry\u2019s jaw, then Draco\u2019s neck, with her wand murmuring under her breath. Harry felt a faint tingle and looked at her curiously.\n\u201cThere was some\u2026 stubble burn,\u201d she explained quietly, a stain of pink appearing high on her cheeks. \"And, um, lovebites.\" \n\u201cThanks,\u201d Harry said, surprised that neither he nor Draco had noticed.\u00a0 \u201cWhere\u2019d you learn the spell?\u201d\nHer flush deepened and she darted a glance to Ron, who looked like he was trying not to grin around a mouthful of food.\nRon swallowed. \u201cSo, er, did you two get any work done?\u201d\n\u201cWe can access the link easily now to get to our Cores,\u201d Draco said into his porridge, not looking up. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be too difficult to untangle them when the time comes.\u201d\n\u201cAnd, uh, after? Are you going to be coming back to Gryffindor?\u201d\nStumped, Harry looked at Ron. Draco didn\u2019t say anything. \u201cI guess so. I mean, yeah. They probably wouldn't let us\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhich we wouldn\u2019t, anyway,\u201d Draco said, darting a nervous look around. \u201cWhat you two saw\u2026 What you know. That has no bearing on the future. Tell them, Potter.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m working on him,\u201d Harry said, ignoring Draco\u2019s cold look. Draco seemed committed to distancing himself from Harry once their cores were separated. Harry wondered how much he could push him.\nAfter breakfast, Harry followed Draco to Advanced Herbology once again and stewed on the subject until class ended, when Draco walked up to Astoria Greengrass and gave her a rather charming smile.\n\u201cAstoria.\u201d\nShe looked pleased. \u201cHi, Draco.\u201d\nHarry's hands fisted of their own accord. He quite suddenly wanted to punch something.\nHe shoved the link open and poured his dissatisfaction across it. Draco blinked twice and gave a minute shake of his head. He leaned into Astoria's space and she looked up at him sweetly. \n\u201cI still have my notes from Sixth year Charms,\" he offered, in an overly-familar voice. \"I thought they might be useful to you.\u201d\nShe opened her mouth to reply but hadn't got a word out by the time Harry'd clamped an unforgiving hand around Draco\u2019s bicep.\n\u201cSorry, Astoria,\u201d he growled. \"Draco and I need to talk.\" He dragged Draco away and shoved him into an alcove.\n\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d Draco said with a haughty lift of his chin.\nHarry carded a hand through his hair. \u201cI get it. Okay? I get it. I saw that letter your mother wrote. I know her friends were attacked for not distancing themselves from your family. I know what you\u2019re doing. You don\u2019t need to do it. I can protect myself.\u201d\n\u201cYou can protect the whole wizarding world, apparently,\u201d Draco sneered. But he wouldn\u2019t look Harry in the eye.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to work,\u201d Harry said. He shuffled closer, crowding him, and saw Draco glance over his shoulder, mute panic flashing over his sharp features.\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to do the right thing,\u201d he said.\n\u201cLook, if you don\u2019t want this,\u201d Harry said, gesturing between them, \u201cI\u2019d understand. But I think you do. And I do. I want this. I want you. I don\u2019t want this to end. But you don\u2019t have to be that way to get me to back off. I will. You don\u2019t have to throw it in my face to hurt me.\u201d\nDraco looked hunted. \u201cThen back off. This morning was the last of it. It has to be,\u201d he said, his voice wavering oddly. \u201cI have to be with a pureblood \u2014 my father, even my mother, expect... And you\u2019re who you are. And you have to have realised by now that this never would have happened if\u2026 If we hadn\u2019t\u2026\u201d\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Harry conceded through a constricted throat. \u201cYou're probably right, it never would have happened. But it did. And not because the spell turned us mad or something.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way you can know that,\u201d Draco said. \u201cI certainly never would have \u2014 with you. I know that much.\u201d\n\u201cSo it gave us a leg up. Helped us get to know each other better than we would have, otherwise,\u201d Harry said. \u201cThis week has been\u2014 I\u2019ve never had anything like it, don\u2019t you know that by now? I didn't know I could, after-- After everything. And this morning,\" Harry swallowed hard, \"you made love to me.\"\n\u201cWe were fucking.\u201d\n\u201cIt was more,\u201d Harry returned flatly. \u201cAnd you knew it. We both knew it. There\u2019s been more between us for a long time, even before the link, I think, and if I can\u2019t protect myself from people who are pissed that I care about you, then maybe I deserve to get my legs hexed off or whatever.\u201d\nDraco made a choked sort of sound. He finally lifted his eyes to Harry\u2019s; they were wet. \u201cI have my life and you have yours. They wouldn\u2019t work together,\u201d he said tightly.\n\u201cNeither should we, but we do,\u201d Harry pointed out. He brushed his thumb over Draco\u2019s cheekbone and Draco shuddered, leaning into it for a scant moment before pulling away.\n\u201cYou need to respect my feelings on this, Potter,\u201d he said at last. \u201cCan you do that? Or do you really need to save everyone?\u201d\nHarry\u2019s hand fell to his side defeat knotting in his stomach. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m the one in need of some saving, for once.\u201d\nDraco\u2019s breath hitched but he shook his head. \u201cThis is the last of it.\u201d\nHarry stepped away, throat tight. \u201cIf you\u2019re sure.\u201d\n***\nThey worked through the rest of the day in relative silence, the link lying dormant between them except when they had to cast in classes. Too soon, they found themselves in McGonagall\u2019s office, sitting side by side as Slughorn hunted through his bag and McGonagall detailed the events what had happened with Highlash.\n\u201cUnder Veritaserum, he admitted that he\u2019d taken this post to run a test linking two student\u2019s Magical Cores for more extensive research than the Ministry deemed safe,\u201d she explained, bristling. \u201cHe apparently thought Mr. Malfoy was a good candidate, based on his\u2026 Ah, previous history. He overheard Mr. Smith discussing his plans and took the opportunity to misdirect Smith's hex so they'd be linked, but he didn't anticipate your Shield charm, Potter. It should have worked but your physical presence between Malfoy and Smith gave the curse something to attach to.\n\u201cMr. Smith is still expelled,\u201d she added, almost as an afterthought. \u201cAnd Professor Highlash will be facing criminal charges.\u201d\nSlughorn placed two phials in front of them, both bearing up smoke in multiple colors. \u201cHere, now, gentlemen! Thank you for your patience. Of course this would have been completed much sooner had I known that it was needed. It\u2019s quite an interesting potion, you know, with\u2014\u201c\n\u201cHorace, please.\u201d\nSlughorn glanced at McGonagall. \u201cRight, right. Please dip your wands in the phials for a moment.\u201d They did and he nodded. \u201cGood, very good.\u201d\n\u201cNow what?\u201d Draco said, voice dull. \n\u201cNow you drink them,\u201d Slughorn said simply. \u201cYou need to focus on your Cores for five minutes afterward to ensure that they are properly disengaged from each other.\u201d\nHarry glanced at Draco holding his breath as Draco picked up his potion and threw it back promptly. Reluctantly, Harry copied him. The potion was peppery on his tongue and he grimaced. He dared another look at Draco, who had closed his eyes immediately. With a sigh, Harry did too.\nThe feathers twirled around him immediately. A gushing breeze swooped and shuddered and Harry found himself at Draco\u2019s pool. He dived in deep, stroking to the bottom in search of the darkness that would lead him to the snarled tangle of their Cores. As he moved deeper, emotions churned around him. Relief, regret, lust, tenderness, anger, resentment. Harry neared the darkness and hesitated on the precipice of it.\nHe looked around, the weight of what they were doing, what they were giving up heavy inside in his heart. All the colours seemed so bright around him and he felt sad at the thought that he'd never see them again.\nImpulsively, he reached up and caught a ripple of water in rich gold. He clasped his hand around it and a rush of different memories spilled into his mind.\n\nWide, emerald eyes \u2014 his own \u2014 stared at Draco across the cavernous room of the Wizengamot. His heart sped up as Memory-Harry walked across the room with long strides, strangely mesmerising and looking far more commanding than Harry had ever remembered feeling. He got through the clog of people to stand before Draco and pressed something delicate and fine into Draco's palm. Draco\u2019s fingers closed around it, the wood of his wand warming as if recognised him. He looked up with gratitude, eyes lingering wordlessly on Harry\u2019s.\n\n\nGreen eyes, staring at Draco triumphantly, pupils blown wide as Harry held up the Snitch in his twelve-year-old fist. Jealousy and fascination filled Draco with equal measure.\n\n\nGreen eyes, watching him from across the Great Hall. Memory-Harry\u2019s glasses were askew and he gave him a tentative, crooked smile. Draco lowered his head, glowering, angry at the blush that climbed up the back of his neck.\n\n\nGreen eyes, wide with surprise and pleasure as Harry pulled back from a kiss. Memory-Harry\u2019s body ground upwards into Draco\u2019s, and Draco wanted, wanted, wanted him, in all of the ways he couldn\u2019t have. So he would just take this, this, just these few days. He\u2019d take the small, insane bit luck he\u2019d finally been granted and enjoy it for as long as he could.\n\n\nGreen eyes, so scared in the dark, surrounded by the ghosts of those he loved and still Memory-Harry marched forward as Draco watched. Memory-Harry headed toward his own murder so that thousands of others could have a chance to live and Draco ached with it, flush with shame, his pain at sight of the bright green of Avada Kedavra rising in an unvoiced howl of grief.\n\n\nGreen eyes, sparking with rage as Highlash was propelled backward by the force of Harry\u2019s hex. Memory-Harry\u2019s face was red and tight, provocative in its fierce protectiveness and Draco wanted to be under him at once, right then, all the time.\n\n\nGreen eyes, growing dark below him. Memory-Harry from that morning made sounds Harry couldn\u2019t hear. His face was desperate with pending release, soft with affection, and Draco loved him, he loved the stupid git, and now he was the stupid one for letting it get this far when it would be over so soon.\n\nHarry heard sound for the first time in Draco's mind. It was his own voice, strong and sure, sent through the link. I love you.\nHarry released the bit of gold. He shakily wondered how much time had elapsed and swam deeper into the darkness, approaching the bright knot of their magic. He rested a hand against it.\u00a0 Slowly, it unfurled before him, and he instinctively began to gather his own, glowing colours in orange and green. They licked their way up his hands like a flame and sank into his skin.\nHe watched as the blue colours seeped away from him and felt it like a vague wrenching inside. Draco's magic began an uneasy flight away from him into the darkness and faded from sight. Harry felt a great, unpleasant tear within and then an emptiness. His eyes fluttered opened.\nLooking around McGonagall's office to get his bearings, Harry could still feel the link as he steadied. He licked his lips and gave it a gentle, questing nudge. Draco twitched and finally opened his eyes as well, but Harry couldn\u2019t feel any response through the link. He wondered if this was the lasting effect Hermione had been so worried about and concluded that if it was, it was rather awful. He didnt want to constantly be able to feel a link that connected with nothing.\nHe didn't want the reminder of what he had lost.\n\u201cDo you both feel all right?\u201d McGonagall asked, interrupting his train of thought.\n\u201cFine,\u201d Draco rasped out after a beat. The headmistress handed him a glass of water and he drank deeply from it.\n\u201cFine,\u201d Harry said. He took the glass from Draco\u2019s hand without asking and wet his own throat with what was left of the water, then set it down on McGonagall\u2019s desk.\n\u201cVery good,\u201d she said. She asked them to each cast a simple spell to verify that their Cores were their own again. Harry cast a a charm to check the time \u2014 it was 7:04 \u2014 and Draco cast a quick hair-smoothing charm on himself, something he\u2019d been unable to do correctly for days. His hair ruffled and settled into silky strands, brushed back from his eyes, and Harry couldn't feel the barest trace of his magic.\n\u201cIt worked,\u201d Harry said.\nDraco stood. \u201cThank you for the help, Professor Slughorn. Headmistress. May I go? I\u2019d like to get back into my room.\u201d\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s fine, Mr. Malfoy. Again, I apologize for the inconvenience,\u201d McGonagall said. Draco brushed his hands lightly over his trousers, smoothing them. He caught Harry\u2019s eyes in a quick, piercing look. He held out his hand and Harry took it. The clasp was tight and dry and over too soon. Draco released him and walked out in long strides, his back held straight.\nHarry leaned back in his chair, feeling nauseated and slightly weak.\nHe somehow felt sure that that had been the last time he would ever touch Draco Malfoy.\nOver the next few weeks, Harry threw himself into his studies, much to Ron\u2019s consternation and Hermione\u2019s delight. It was something to do, to fill the extra time he found himself with. After having moved back into Gryffindor Tower, he was unable to sleep. He\u2019d gotten so used to Draco's warm, lanky body pressed against him, wrapped around him, it felt wrong and off-putting to wake up alone, which made falling asleep hard. \nThen there were the dreams in which he could feel the link flare to life, bombarding him with memories, wants, desires. Sometimes in them, he and Draco were in the shower and Draco was making snide remarks about how even magic wouldn't be able to fix Harry\u2019s hair. Sometimes they were sitting together quietly, reading. Most often, it was the single, shining moment of a kiss that lingered a moment too long in Harry\u2019s mind. He would wake up hard and aching and open up his side of the link to search for Draco, finding nothing but a void. \nMore disturbingly, he dreamed of Draco and Astoria, being walked down a white aisle by their parents, Draco struggling to get away while everyone smiled benignly at him. Once, he dreamt of Draco staring down at his face, a ribbon of blood dripping out of his mouth.\n Better to stay awake, then. \nHe filled in the hole in his schedule left by Advanced Magical Theory \u2014 they wouldn\u2019t have a teacher to fill the position until after the winter hols \u2014 with Advanced Care For Magical Creatures so he could spend some time with Hagrid. With McGonagall\u2019s permission, he also added Advanced Muggle Studies. It wasn't a required course for him but the extra assignments kept his focus on schoolwork and he rather liked being able to tutor the students who'd been raised in wizarding homes. \nThe only downside was that Pansy was seated next to him in the class. so Harry had a running diatribe in his ear on her opinions of compulsory classes for Slytherins, of Muggles, of her new make-up charms, her wardrobe, whichever wizard she was seeing at the moment, and of course, on Draco.\n \u201cDraco\u2019s visiting his mother this weekend, again,\u201d she complained one day while Harry mixed some cookie dough for the cooking portion of their class and she stood by, refusing to help. \u201cHe visits her every weekend now, never spends any time with us anymore.\u201d \nHarry tightened his mouth and told her to hand him a measuring cup.\n They were budgeting for groceries using pounds instead of Galleons when she threw her hands up in exasperation. \u201cI have lots of gold, why do I need to know this? It\u2019s not as if I\u2019m going to run out of money \u2014 or have to buy my own supplies, I might add. We\u2019ve all had house-elves since we were little. Draco used to make them pretend to be puppies.\u201d\n Harry shook his head, pressing down too hard with his quill and watching helplessly as ink bled across the parchment. \nThey were cleaning the gloppy mess that the professor had conjured with rags and water and Muggle cleaning products \u2014 or, Harry was \u2014 when Pansy huffed, \u201cI don\u2019t know why they don\u2019t just use cleaning charms.\u201d \n\u201cMuggles can\u2019t do magic, Pansy,\u201d Harry said, grinding his teeth. \n\u201cWell, they should hire people to do it for them.\u201d She paused to point her wand at a bit of goop on her skirt. It vanished. \u201cDraco always says that the key to living a good life is having the sense to hire people to do the unpleasant things for you.\u201d \nHarry slipped on a puddle of sludge at their feet and went down in a spectacular heap, banging his chin on the edge of the desk as he flailed and dropped to the floor.\nAnd then, of course, he had to see Draco four times per week, in Potions and Transfiguration. Harry swallowed his pride and asked McGonagall and Slughorn if they could avoid being paired. \u201cI think we just need a bit of space, after what happened,\u201d he\u2019d said, his voice sounding strange to his own ears. To his relief, they agreed and didn't ask questions. \nBut in classes, Harry could see Draco, the slender line of him hunched over his parchment to take notes, the graceful motions he made when waving his wand, his thoughtless efficiency as he chopped ingredients in potions with dexterous, elegant fingers. Harry would find himself taking a step in his direction, simply wanting to be next to him, before stopping himself and setting back to his work. It was what Draco wanted.\n But occasionally, his would catch Draco\u2019s gaze on him from across the room and the sleeping link would seem to pulse for a moment before Draco slid his eyes away, the link going as blank as his face. \nWorking with Hagrid was a relief from all of it. Harry found solace in being outdoors, working with creatures that didn\u2019t look at him with worship or questions. It had the added benefit of being away from the castle, where he was unlikely to see Draco in the corridors. Hagrid had been delighted to see him, his Advanced class being quite small and consisting mostly of seventh years from Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw who Harry didn\u2019t know. Still, he worked hard at it and found himself smiling more easily there than he could in any other classes. Hagrid had gotten better at teaching, over the years, teaching them how to uncover a Bowtruckle's nest and watching a Kneazle give birth over a period of fourteen hours \u2014 Harry had gotten to miss both Transfiguration and Potions that lucky day, and was able to hold one of the kittens, which weighed over ten pounds. But his favorite was when Hagrid took them out to find Unicorns again. One had walked up to Harry with shining eyes and nudged her velvety, insistent nose against his head, filling him with a sense of piece and calm. It was nice while it lasted.\n Afterward, Harry would go to Hagrid\u2019s hut, where Hagrid would talk about creatures or the weather or possible lesson plans in a rumbly, idle voice while he worked on small items with his giant, gentle hands, and Harry would allow his voice to lull him into a sort of stasis where he didn\u2019t hurt so goddamn fucking bad that he wanted to scream from it, every second of every day for over a month. \nHagrid would stuff rock cake down him with the aid of lots of tea and Harry would finally trudge back to the castle, feeling full and wobbly and tired before settling down to do homework with Hermione or playing half-hearted chess with Ron. \nAnything to busy. \nAs wrapped up in each other as they were, Ron and Hermione noticed. Of course they did; Harry\u2019s luck had never extended that far. Hermione began delicately bringing up the \u201cMalfoy thing,\u201d at regular intervals and Ron had somehow convinced himself it was about the \u201cliking blokes thing.\u201d He told them both to bugger off in the nicest tone he could manage. \nStill, he knew them well enough to figure out what was coming when Hermione put down her quill one night with a click and said, \u201cThere\u2019s a boy in Ancient Runes I think you\u2019d like, Harry.\u201d\n Harry groaned, taking off his glasses to rub his gritty eyes. He was only halfway through twenty inches on the wand motions for conjuring live creatures based on size and he wondered briefly if he was going mental or if Hermione was just planning on driving him there. \u201cI\u2019m fine, thanks.\u201d \nShe nudged Ron with a sharp elbow. Ron gave a low \u2018oof\u2019 before looking up. \u201cNo, it\u2019s true. Name\u2019s Robert Sheffield. Nice. Blond, since you, you know\u2026 Go for that. Quite fit.\u201d \nThe name sounded familiar and after a moment, it clicked. Robert Sheffield: quiet, tall boy with dark blond hair in Hagrid\u2019s class. A Hufflepuff. Harry had caught his sideways glances, filled with curiosity but none of the vapid hero-worship that gave Harry a headache. \n\u201cI know him. He\u2019s in Magical Creatures with me,\u201d Harry said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not into \u2014 you know, blond blokes.\u201d He scrubbed a hand over his face. \u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of blokes I like. There\u2019s just been the one.\u201d \n\u201cEven better! Now you have the opportunity to find out,\u201d Hermione said brightly, cringing when she was promptly shushed by Madam Pince. She lowered her voice. \u201cUnless, you know, you and Draco were\u2026\u201d \n\u201cWere what? He\u2019s done with it. Done with me. He didn't believe me that it wasn't all because of the spell, and anyway, he made it clear he needs a pureblood in his life. His family\u2019s going to marry him off to someone in the Special 28,\u201d Harry muttered. He knew it was unfair but he was too tired to care.\n Ron made a weird bleating sound. \u201cSacred 28. But ew. Did he actually say that to you? What a right arsehole, not that we didn\u2019t know that about him already. You\u2019re well rid of him, right \u2018Mione?\u201d \nHermione was quiet. Harry glanced at her and was surprised to see her gazing at him thoughtfully. \u201cWell\u2026\u201d \n\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry looked around as if the books on the shelves might be able to explain the odd expression on Hermione\u2019s face. \n\u201cWell, I mean, yes. Of course, it\u2019s an awful thing to say,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cBut, it sort of matters to him, a bit, right? Family obligation. Or it must to the people he loves. I mean, he\u2019s obviously changed since the War. I think even before that.\u201d\n Harry's mind flashed to the memory of Draco pointing a tentative wand at Bellatrix Lestrange as she tortured Hermione.\n \u201cAnyway,\u201d Hermione said. \u201cThe thing of it is, though you might technically be a halfblood \u2014 although really, that's debatable because your mother was a witch even though she was Muggle-born. It's actually a really interesting argument about the perspective of what constitutes 'pureblood,' when you think about\u2014\"\nHarry coughed and she coloured.\n\"Anyway,\" she continued after a beat, \"your magical heritage is more pure than most, Harry.\u201d \n\u201cMy mom came from Muggles, like you said,\u201d he said, confused.\n\u201cWell, yes. But she was a witch. And your dad\u2026 Well, haven\u2019t you ever researched his family line?\u201d \n\u201cI know he was a pureblood,\u201d Harry said defensively. \u201cI know about his family.\u201d \n\u201cRight, but if blood status means something to Draco \u2014 and don't get me wrong, I don't think it should, but, well, you know that the Sacred 28 should be the Sacred 29, right?\u201d \nHarry stared at her, confusion mounting when Ron\u2019s expression cleared and he nodded with understanding. \u201cOh, yeah.\u201d \n\u201cWhat are you two on about?\u201d Harry asked, rapidly losing patience. \nRon shrugged. \u201cWe don\u2019t pay much attention to the list. I mean, you know Dad. And Mum, too. S\u2019all rather stupid, if you ask me, because pretty much every wizarding family has diluted its blood line somehow by this point, right?\u201d Hermione nodded, and Ron continued. \u201cBut I guess the Potters were on the list, too. They got removed a long time ago, not sure why. I think one of them was after reform towards Muggles and it pissed everyone else off or something. Dad used to joke about it with Mum when I was a kid. 'Maybe if we\u2019re lucky enough with this one, they\u2019ll kick us out of the Sacred 28.\u2019\u201d\n Harry took that in. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said at last. \u201cThere\u2019s the whole producing-an-heir thing he mentioned, and obviously \u2014 us being blokes\u2014\u201c\n \u201cActually,\u201d Ron said with a strange smile before promptly shutting up and rubbing his ribs where Hermione had elbowed him.\n \u201cDon\u2019t freak him out.\u201d She turned to Harry. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. But I mean, the other thing is something to consider. If it matters to him. If that\u2019s the real reason why you guys aren\u2019t seeing each other anymore.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s one of them,\u201d Harry mumbled. His head was starting to hurt. \u201cAlso the spell. He thinks it happened because of the spell.\u201d\n \u201cWell, didn\u2019t it?\u201d Hermione said briskly, parroting Harry\u2019s thoughts. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean\u2026\u201d \n\u201cTry telling him that,\u201d Harry said sullenly. \nRon scoffed. \u201cBlimey, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m encouraging this.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cYou try, Mate. You\u2019re the one who matters to him. You\u2019re the one who cares.\u201d \nHermione gave him another elbow to the ribs. \u201cWe care, Harry. We just don\u2019t want you to be so\u2026 Sad all the time. And if it\u2019s not Draco, there are plenty of other boys \u2014 or girls \u2014 who\u2019d be happy to go out with you.\u201d \nHarry slammed his books shut a bit harder than necessary. \u201cI really don\u2019t need your help,\u201d he snapped. Hermione looked down, her mouth trembling. Harry looked away, feeling like a dick \u2014 even worse when Ron glared at him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m just not\u2026 I guess I\u2019m not there.\u201d \nHermione looked up, firming her chin. \u201cThen that should tell you something, Harry.\u201d \nYeah. He guessed it did. \nHe just didn\u2019t know what he could do about it.\n *** \nThe following day in Transfiguration, Harry allowed himself to watch Draco more carefully than he had for over a month. Though Draco didn\u2019t look up at him once, Harry had a feeling he could feel Harry's eyes on him by the bracing of his shoulders, by the tension in the back of his neck. His wand movements were clipped almost to the point of being jerky and he had to Vanish more than one attempt at Conjuring the miniature, palm-sized Erumpent they'd been assigned. \nAfter class was over, Harry took a deep breath and walked over to Draco\u2019s desk, crouching as if to tie his shoe. As he fumbled with the laces, he shoved open his side of the long-dormant link. It felt rusty from lack of use but undeniably there. Into the void, Harry concentrated on funneling a feeling through: I miss you, all the time. It wasn\u2019t just the spell. \nDraco stood and Harry looked up hopefully, but Draco didn\u2019t even bother glancing down at him as he stuffed the rest of his books into his bag and circled around Harry, who by now probably looked daft in his current pose of fake-tying-laces. Harry stood up slowly, his eyes trailing after Draco out of the doors of the classroom, where Astoria Greengrass was apparently waiting for him. \nSick with jealousy, he watched Draco\u2019s head dip to say something near her ear, his white-blond hair glinting in the sunlight. Astoria smiled up at him in a friendly fashion and the nausea in Harry\u2019s stomach transformed into gnawing pain. He stumbled out of the classroom amongst the rest of the students, nearly tripping when grey eyes caught his with a level gaze. Draco gave him a cautious nod, then went back to talking to Astoria, face intent.\u00a0For a bizarre, tilting moment Harry debated running over there and dragging Draco off again, just abducting him away \u2014 he closed his eyes and remembered kissing him and being kissed by him \u2014 but his legs were rooted to the spot. \nStudents filed passed him and it seemed like everything was going in slow-motion, a blur of colour and noise, none of which reached him but those two heads, one dark and light, close to each other, whispering things he couldn't hear. He startled at the feel of a hand on his arm. \nHermione stood there, looking at him sympathetically. \u201cTime for lunch, Harry.\u201d \nHarry swallowed thickly and nodded, never less hungry in his life. He followed after her and picked at his food, watching the doors the whole time for Draco, who never arrived. \nAfter lunch he trudged to Muggle Studies. Pansy was waiting at their shared desk, flicking through what looked like a Muggle fashion magazine. She glanced up at him with a sardonic smile. \n\u201cWe\u2019re studying something called Popular Culture today. It\u2019s weird how the pictures don\u2019t move,\u201d she said, looking back down at the magazine. \u201cThe clothing would probably sell better if people could see how it flowed.\u201d\n Harry grunted, sliding in beside her. There was a stack of other magazines and newspapers from varying years: The Daily Mirror, The Sun, Glamour, The New York Times. He grabbed one of the newspapers and leafed through it listlessly.\n \u201cOf course, it doesn\u2019t matter to some people how they look,\u201d Pansy continued with a pointed eyeroll in Harry\u2019s direction. \u201cBut for some of us, style comes very naturally. Take Draco for instance \u2014 the pleat in his trousers always falls just right. So does his hair. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve noticed.\u201d \nActually, he'd noticed him more naked, Harry thought, his hands tightening on the newspaper. \n\u201cAnd he always smells so good.\u201d Pansy gave a little sigh of delight. \u201cHis hair potions come from France, you know.\u201d \nHarry did know. Once Draco had discovered that Harry liked it when he spoke French, he\u2019d murmured filthy little words in his ear while fucking Harry hard from behind. It was only later, when Harry had asked him what he had been saying, that Draco had laughed and admitted to listing what ingredients he could remember from his shampoo potion.\n \u201cAnd then, of course, there\u2019s his body,\u201d Pansy said and Harry cut her off with a snarl. \n\u201cFine! Fucking fine! You want to talk about Draco?\u201d His heart was beating too fast. \nPansy came immediately to her feet. \u201cProfessor? I think Potter here is feeling sick. May I take him to see Madam Pomfrey?\u201d\n The professor nodded in a rather vague way and Pansy grabbed Harry\u2019s arm, hustling him out of class. Once they were in the corridor, she let go and threw her hands up in the air with a great, gusting sigh. \u201cFinally!\u201d \n\u201cWhat the fuck, Pansy,\u201d Harry said angrily. \u201cWhat are you doing, going on about him? What do you expect?\u201d \n\u201cI expect you to act like the bloody Savior and go save him from himself!\u201d she snapped. \nHarry drew back in surprise. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want me to be his savior, whatever that means. He specifically told me that.\u201d\n \u201cNo, you utter twat, he wants you to be his boyfriend. So grow some balls, already. I\u2019m sick of this shit.\u201d Pansy matched his glare with one of her own. \n\u201cYou\u2019re sick of it? You\u2019re not the one who got shoved aside for his his parent's expectations, or because he was afraid something would happen to you if\u2026\u201d \nPansy looked at him shrewdly. \u201cIf you dated a Death Eater?\u201d Harry nodded and she gave a humorless laugh. \u201cMerlin, that\u2019s rich. Like his life wouldn\u2019t be in ten times the amount of danger yours would be in if you guys went public.\u201d\n Harry sucked in a breath. \u201cWould it really?\u201d\n \u201cCome on, Potter. I know you\u2019re oblivious to practically everything and that you handled the Dark Lord with pretty much a wand and a prayer, but think about it. Of course he would be. But I\u2019m guessing you\u2019d let him make that decision for himself.\u201d \nSomething unpleasant turned over in his stomach at the idea of people threatening Draco for being with him but Harry had to admit she was right. He was all-too-aware of what it was like when other people decided what was right for you. He nodded again.\n \u201cWell, then, you\u2019re going to have to convince him that what you want is enough.\u201d \n\u201cHow do I do that? I\u2019ve done everything I can think of,\u201d Harry said. \nPansy sighed again, a gentler sound. \u201cPersevere, Potter; that\u2019s what you do, right?. Nothing will get through his wily Slytherin brain better than convincing him that you\u2019re just not going anywhere, that it\u2019s more advantageous for him to just give in than to know you're out there, disrupting his calm all of the time. Besides,\u201d she added, almost sadly, \u201cpeople never fight for him. Even his parents didn\u2019t, before. Not enough.\u201d She looked away. \u201cI\u2019ll leave the details of what to do up to you.\u201d \nShe turned to go and Harry snapped a hand around her wrist to stop her. She turned back, raising her eyebrows. \n\u201cHow is he?\u201d Harry asked, unable to help himself.\n Her face twisted. \u201cNot good. He walks around like a wounded kitten all the time. Blaise told me he doesn\u2019t sleep. He won\u2019t talk about it, so we don\u2019t know exactly what happened although I have a guess \u2014 Blaise found my book in Draco's trunk and returned it to me, thankyouverymuch. I\u2019m tired of being worried about him. He\u2019s my oldest friend and I\u2019ve spent the last two years terrified for his safety and I thought I was done with it. So you need to fix this, already.\u201d \nShe pulled her wrist out of his grasp and began to flounce away. \n\u201cPansy?\u201d\nShe turned back around, irritated. \n\u201cYes?\u201d \n\u201cCan I borrow your book again?\u201d \nPansy stared at him. Slowly, her mouth curled up in a devious little smile. \n***\nThe following day in Potions, Harry decided to start out small. He clutched the crumpled note in his hand nervously, waiting for the right moment to send it over. \nIt seemed like he would never get a chance, but near the end of the class, when Slughorn was busy rooting for something in his cabinet and Draco was half-turned away from him, Harry whispered a charm and watched the little ball parchment zoom over to Draco and drop onto his desk. Draco turned in surprise and picked it up, glancing around suspiciously. His eyes landed on Harry who looked back at him with as bland an expression as he could manage.\nDraco dropped his eyes to the note and shoved his hands under his desk as he fumbled it open. A moment later, his pale face went Gryffindor-red and he snapped accusing eyes up to Harry, who grinned, showing lots of teeth. \nHe had hoped for a reaction half as good as he watched Draco shift uneasily in his seat and even reach down to adjust himself furtively. He didn\u2019t look in Harry\u2019s direction again. \nThe scrap of paper with the single word, Lubrico on it, written in Harry\u2019s spiky hand, was now clutched in Draco\u2019s tight grip. He\u2019d needed Pansy\u2019s book to look up the spelling of the lubrication spell, but Draco, of course, recognized it immediately. \nHe knew he was pushing it but he tore off another bit of parchment from the bottom of his homework and scrawled, Wish I was that paper. He levitated it quickly over to Draco, relieved when Draco snatched it out of the air with his free hand before Slughorn saw it. \nDraco looked down, eyes moving. His mouth tightened and he dropped both notes like they burned him. He sent Harry a warning glare, pulled out his wand, and Vanished each note in turn.\nHarry shrugged, wiggling his eyebrows. He opened his side of the link and sent a shot of attraction through it. Startled triumph took his breath away as something like alarm coursed back at him \u2014 his first confirmation that both sides of the link could still be used \u2014 a split second before Draco shot out of his seat. He stalked up to Slughorn and held out a hand with his stoppered phial to the surprised professor, slammed his homework down, and stalked out.\nHermione half-turned in her seat, watching Draco go, along with everyone else. Ron leaned over to him. \u201cWas that you?\u201d\n Harry felt a bit like cheering. \u201cThat was me,\u201d he confirmed. \n\u201cAnd you think making him mad is going to\u2026 get him back?\u201d\nHarry snorted. \u201cProbably the only thing that will,\u201d he said with certain amount of satisfaction.\nThat night, Harry slept harder than he had in almost five weeks. He had a dream where Draco shouted at him for a solid hour before snogging him senseless and Vanishing their clothes and when he woke up, he was hard and restless. \nHe poked at the link experimentally. Since the Potions incident, it had been annoyingly silent. But he could always feel it, even at rest, which meant that Draco could too \u2014 even though he avoided using it. Maybe Harry just needed to bother him enough.\nHe opened up his mind and allowed images of Draco to fill his head: on all fours in front of Harry, washing Harry\u2019s cock with a light hand in the shower. Harry glanced around to make sure his curtains were shut, then slipped a hand into his pajama pants, closing it tightly around his morning erection. As he tugged on it slowly, winding himself up, he made sure to send as many memories and sensations through the link as he could conjure and he could feel the exact moment that Draco got curious enough to open up his side because Harry was suddenly blasted with a wave of angry arousal. \nHarry moved his hand faster, gasping and unbearably turned on by just the idea that Draco knew what he was doing. Gonna come thinking about you, Draco, he thought breathlessly and promptly did, spurting into his frantic hand.\nThe link closed so hard it practically made a noise and Harry leaned back against his pillows, panting. All in all, he thought that had gone well.\nAt breakfast, he sent over another little note, this time with a picture copied from Pansy\u2019s book, the man and woman charmed into a slender blond leaning over grabbing his ankles as a darker haired man knelt behind him, face buried in his arse. The blond man leaned into it, his face tight with near-release.\nHarry\u2019s wand twitched a little with nerves when Draco glanced up and Harry cringed, hoping it wouldn\u2019t affect his aim. It did, but just barely. The picture landed in front of Pansy, who picked it up and opened it, ignoring Draco\u2019s panicked reach for it. She stared down in silence, clapped a hand over her mouth to muffle her laugh, and looked up to find Harry with bright, approving eyes.\nHe gave her a small, embarrassed smile.\nHer face relaxed. She shrugged nonchalantly and said something to Draco as she tossed the note at him. He scrambled for it and tore it back open, hunching over it to shield its contents. \nAs Harry watched, Draco froze. He swallowed convulsively, shaking his head in disbelief. When he finally looked up, his face had gone rigid. He met Harry's gaze and jerked his head to the doorway before getting up and leaving the room. Harry followed him.\n Draco was waiting in a stone nook twenty yards away. Harry ambled up to him, finally feeling truly uncertain since he had talked to Pansy. He took a deep breath; nothing to gain by not trying, and all that. \n\u201cYou beckoned?\u201d Harry asked, trying for a casual tone.\n \u201cWhat the fuck do you think you\u2019re doing, Potter?\u201d Draco hissed, complexion white with rage. \u201cSending me this\u2026 this\u2026\u201d \nHarry stepped closer. \u201cI thought maybe you had forgotten. I haven\u2019t. I think about it all the time. In fact, this is the best I\u2019ve felt in weeks,\u201d he said, leaning close and breathing in the smell of Draco\u2019s aftershave. It was spicy today, with that lingering tropical scent that probably came from his hair. \nDraco batted him away. \u201cAre you smelling me?\u201d \nHarry sighed. \u201cGet over it, Draco. I miss you, okay? And you miss me, too. I know you do. I\u2019ve been trying to stay away but that\u2019s not making either of us happy, so you should get used to me again. We\u2019re still linked and that\u2019s not going away, either, is it? You like taking advantage of circumstance? I\u2019ll make sure you have to, every morning, and night, and sometimes in the middle of the day, until you start being reasonable about this.\u201d\n He turned to walk away and was halted by Draco calling after him. \u201cIt\u2019ll go away if you stop using it. Stop using the link, Potter!\u201d \nHarry turned back and smiled. \u201cNo.\u201d \n*** \nTrue to his word, Harry instituted an all-open, all-the-time policy when it came to the link. \nSince sexual intent seemed to have the easiest time getting through \u2014 or at least, that was what Draco was most responsive to \u2014 Harry used it when he wanked in the morning, flooding the link with memories of things they had done and ideas of things they could try. He began having a wank at night as well, sometimes two. And, just for good measure, had excused himself from a couple of classes for several minutes, only to come back and find Draco sweating and nervous, face flushed, his eyes shooting daggers at Harry\u2019s suddenly relaxed figure. (That part was difficult. Harry had never done it in the middle of a school day before, let alone during class time. The first time, he felt sure that as soon as he came back in, everyone would know what he had been up to. When no one but Draco seemed to suspect anything, it got easier.) \nConstant masturbation aside, Harry found himself floundering for ideas for how to reach Draco, who studiously ignored him whenever he wasn\u2019t sneering in Harry\u2019s direction. It felt like the beginning of eighth year all over again except that, sometimes, Harry could feel a shudder of release spiral through Draco\u2019s end of the link when Harry\u2019s constant teasing got too much for him. Sometimes, Harry could sense Draco\u2019s frustration bleeding across the link before Draco got it under control and snapped his side closed. \nAfter a week of it, Harry was almost sure that Draco would snap, resulting in an either extremely dead or extremely satisfied Harry, but nothing happened.\u00a0 He stopped sending notes when Draco began simply Vanishing them without looking at them first and reconsidered.\n He detained Pansy on their way out of Muggle Studies. \u201cHow\u2019s he doing? Has he said anything?\u201d \nShe shrugged, feigning disinterest, but her eyes were sly. \u201cA bit more like himself. When he\u2019s pissed off about something, which is never something I want to be around. Liked the picture, by the way.\u201d Harry flushed; he should have known she'd comment on it eventually. \u201cSo that\u2019s it?\u201d she prompted. \u201cDirty pictures?\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m doing other things,\u201d Harry grumbled. \u201cHe just won\u2019t talk to me about them.\u201d \n\u201cHave lunch with us,\u201d she said suddenly. \nHarry\u2019s head jerked up. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n \u201cNo, really. Have lunch with us. I mean, you used to, before. I\u2019ll take the blame, if you need me to,\u201d she offered.\n \u201cWhy?\u201d\n Pansy snorted inelegantly. \u201cWell, if nothing else, it should be amusing.\u201d \nHe followed her to the Slytherin table, a tentative idea forming in his mind. Draco looked up with shocked eyes as Harry sat down next to him, but Blaise grinned. \u201cOh ho, Harry! Thought you didn\u2019t like us anymore now that you two had parted ways.\u201d\n \u201cCan\u2019t stand you lot,\u201d Harry said with an answering grin. \u201cI\u2019m just here for Draco.\u201d \nBlaise and Pansy laughed. Draco's glare promised all three of them death, which made his friends laugh harder. Harry pressed the length of his thigh against Draco\u2019s under the table and frowned when Draco pulled away at once. \n\u201cI could tell you another way,\u201d Harry suggested under his breath and opened the link. He wondered if maybe focusing on the sexual aspect of their relationship had been going at it all wrong. This time he pushed through the ache he\u2019d been carrying around for too long, the loneliness that he felt without Draco\u2019s snide remarks and unexpected affection. \nDraco made a small noise in the back of his throat and Harry\u2019s mouth ran dry. He felt an answering nudge of raw pain, almost like a thought. Stop it. Please. It won\u2019t work. \nHarry exhaled slowly. Maybe. But you won\u2019t even try.\n Too dangerous, please. \nHarry snorted. For me, or you?\u201d \n\u201cFuck you!\u201d Draco blurted. Pansy and Blaise paused, mid-chat, to look at them strangely, and Harry realised he and Draco had been staring at each other in silence for who knew how long. \nHe took a deep breath, rattled. \u201cWell, I\u2019m open to that again, whenever you\u2019re ready.\u201d \n\u201cShut your mouth, Potter,\u201d Draco hissed. His wand was suddenly in his hand but Harry didn\u2019t flinch from the sight of it.\u00a0What did bother him was the whiteness of Draco\u2019s face and the way his hand was shaking. \u201cDon\u2019t you have any sense of self-preservation?\u201d \nHarry paused and considered it. \u201cI guess it depends on what I think will hurt me the most,\u201d he said, filling up his plate. \u201cHey, did you all know that my dad was one of those Sacred Family people? Sort of, I guess.\u201d\n Pansy and Blaise exchanged a disbelieving look. \u201cOf course we know about the Potters. Technically you\u2019re not on the list anymore, though.\u201d\n \u201cDoes that matter if your bloodline is pure?\u201d Harry wondered aloud vaguely, feeling a bit like Luna. He stuffed a forkful of food into his mouth and watched Draco\u2019s face.\u00a0 Draco didn\u2019t say anything, but Blaise lifted his shoulders. \n\u201cMaybe not. Maybe so. Depends on the reason. Why?\u201d he asked, blinking at the venomous look Pansy shot him through her lashes. \nHarry swallowed. \u201cDunno. Might just be important for some people to consider. For some reason. Even though it\u2019s stupid.\u201d He ate another bite \u2014 really, the food at the Slytherin table was pretty excellent \u2014 and kicked bumped Draco\u2019s shoe with his own. \u201cDo you know anyone who that would matter to?\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d Draco said coldly. \n\u201cOh. Want to go to Hogsmeade with me this weekend?\u201d\n \u201cHave you gone completely mental without sex, Potter?\u201d Draco whispered spitefully, too low for anyone else to hear. \u201cIs that what this is about? You want me on my knees one last time, maybe? What are you angling for, here?\u201d \nHarry stopped, meeting his eyes. He ignored the sudden throb in his cock and focused on the anger instead. \u201cYou. I\u2019m angling for you. Because you don\u2019t get to decide what\u2019s safe for me or not. You know how it\u2019s been for me, Draco, you of all people have seen\u2014\u201c He broke off, his throat tight. \u201cYou know that I know what it is to be an instrument. And I won\u2019t be yours, even for my own protection. Not in a way I don\u2019t choose.\u201d\n Harry stood up, appetite gone and opened up the link as wide as he could. He pushed everything he was feeling into it, all of his confusion and loss and pain and need. \u201cSo say what you want to other people about us,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cBut I\u2019m not pretending anymore. If someone asks me out, I\u2019m going to say no \u2014 because I\u2019m taken. Then it\u2019s not on you if someone gets mad about it, is it? It\u2019s a choice I made. You can make your own and I hope you\u2019re smarter than you\u2019ve been about them in the past.\u201d \nPansy and Blaise, as well as a tight knot of younger Slytherins and a small group of Hufflepuffs that were sitting nearby, were staring at Harry with identical expressions of shock and interest. Harry walked passed them, shaking and sat down heavily at the Gryffindor table, where Ron patted his shoulder clumsily. \n\u201cAll right, mate?\u201d \nHarry stared at the table, stomach roiling. \u201cNot even a little.\u201d\n \u201cIf the stupid bastard won\u2019t reconsider, there\u2019s always that other guy,\u201d Ron mumbled. \nHarry nodded glumly. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d he said, knowing that he wouldn\u2019t. \nHe didn\u2019t want anyone else; he just wanted Draco back.\n ***\n Harry\u2019s first chance came two days later, when a reedy girl from Ravenclaw with glasses and dark hair down to her waist approached him with that certain look about her.\u00a0 Autograph or date, he wondered. A group of her friends stood ten yards away and Harry braced himself. \n\u201cHi, um, Mr\u2014Harry?\u201d\n He stalled in the corridor, trying not to cringe. It wasn\u2019t her fault that he was so stupidly famous that people got the idea they knew him. Plus, she was young \u2014 Merlin, she couldn\u2019t be more than fifteen, which made him uncomfortable on a completely different level.\n \u201cHi, er\u2026\u201d \n\u201cAmelia,\u201d she said, casting a wide-eyed look behind her to her friends. They looked like they wanted to giggle. \u201cI, um, I heard that you\u2026 I mean, I heard that you and Ginny Weasley weren\u2019t\u2026 I was wondering if you might fancy going out sometime?\u201d \nHarry sighed. More often than not, they lost their courage and scampered away before it got this far.\u00a0 \u201cI appreciate it, but\u2026\u201d \nHer face screwed into an overly-sympathetic expression and she put her hand on his bicep, giving it a light squeeze. She actually squeezed his bicep. Harry stared at her, numb with surprise. Merlin, the girl should\u2019ve been Housed in Gryffindor. Or possibly Slytherin. \u201cI understand. Breaking up can be hard, right? But if\u2026\u201d \nHarry shook her hand off, sympathy vanishing with his patience. \u201cThanks, but I\u2019m bent,\u201d he snapped. \u201cAnd taken.\u201d \nHe walked away, ignoring her shocked intake of breath and the way she ran back to her friends. \nNews apparently travelled fast, because that night during dinner, two more girls approached him, ostensibly to ask him out but really to gather verification for the rumour. A sixth year Hufflepuff boy tried as well and when Harry repeated his line about being taken, was the only one who bothered to ask by whom.\n Harry stalled, thinking of Pansy\u2019s prediction of how dangerous it might be fore Draco to be associated with him but Ron had no such compunction. He waved his fork in the direction of the Slytherin table. \u201cMalfoy,\u201d he announced. \u201cThey\u2019re on the outs right now, but he\u2019ll come around. Harry\u2019s daft over him.\u201d\u00a0 Harry kicked him under the table and Ron winced. \u201cBut, you know, not like love-potion daft.\u201d \nThe boy nodded with good grace and quirked a crooked smile at Harry that he found himself returning. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll come around. You\u2019re\u2026 um\u2026 very fit.\u201d \nHarry was startled into a laugh. \u201cThanks.\u201d\n He felt an unpleasant tug inside and glanced over to find Draco staring lividly at the retreating student, upper lip drawn back into a silent snarl. Draco finally tore his eyes away and stabbed at his food. He jerked away from the light touch Pansy pressed to his forearm. \nHarry smiled. \n*** \nThe following morning, Harry was dismayed but unsurprised to find that his face was splashed all over the front page of The Prophet with the headline, SPECIAL EDITION! THE BOY WHO LIVED TO LOVE ANOTHER WIZARD: A HEARTBREAK FOR WITCHES EVERYWHERE. It seemed like every student was reading it. \nHe held his head high as he walked through the dining hall and grabbed some toast, munching on it as he skimmed through the copy Hermione handed him silently. It was a fairly standard rundown of Hogwarts gossip, although there was a section filled with conjecture about how fighting Voldemort might have changed his \u201cnatural\u201d inclinations to what they currently were. There was also a full page dedicated to how devastated Ginny must be over the news. \nHarry glanced at her. Her eyes gleamed with amusement as she perused the article in question and she sent him a swift, sympathetic little smirk. Harry grinned and continued reading. \nThere was a bit at the end speculating over who he was dating \u2014 someone in Slytherin, their anonymous sources claimed \u2014 but strangely, no actual mention of Draco even though everyone around them had heard Ron announce it the previous night.\n \u201cCheck out the Slytherin table,\u201d Ron snickered suddenly.\n Harry put down the paper and looked over. \nOwls had begun streaking in, dropping piles of mail on pretty much every Slytherin boy, even some of the younger ones. Draco was practically covered in them, trying to Vanish the whole lot even as more fluttered down. Harry heard the sudden snap of windows shutting and a felt the crackle of magic. He looked up to find McGonagall standing at the Professor\u2019s table, wand out. \n\u201cWhile I appreciate that there may be some news that many students are finding particularly fascinating,\u201d she announced, \u201cI would like to remind everyone to respect the privacy of your classmates. I will be adding wards to the mail for Slytherin students immediately, to allow mail in only by those whom you approve. Please have a list to me by the end of lunch today.\u201d\n She sat down and Harry spared a moment to be grateful she had already added one for him on the first day of term, when he\u2019d been besieged with letters \u2014 and more than a few packages that had turned out to contain love-spelled items and lust potions.\n Harry watched sympathetically as almost all of the Slytherin boys who had mail scampered out of their places and left the Great Hall, Draco included.\u00a0 Blaise sat peacefully in his spot, opening his mail with what looked like great delight.\n With a regretful sigh \u2014 he\u2019d barely managed to finish some toast and bacon, Harry shoved out of his seat and followed the exodus. \nHe opened the link tentatively, searching for Draco. Are you okay? \nA harassed, snide feeling shot back at him. Harry chuckled a little at how so very Malfoy it was. Where are you?\n There was such a long pause that Harry started to consider heading to his rooms to get his map, when a blurry, strained image came through showing a first year Charms classroom. Harry turned a corner and jogged down the corridor to the room in question and slipped inside. \nDraco sat at a desk, head in his hands. \u201cWhy are you doing this, Potter?\u201d \nHarry stopped, astonished, eyes on the curve of Draco\u2019s neck, on the hair falling over his eyes. \u201cI thought it was obvious.\u201d\n Draco gave a harsh little bark of laughter. \u201cYes, and we should all be subjected to your version of what\u2019s obvious. You\u2019re stalking me. Not like that\u2019s new.\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m not stalking you.\" Harry winced and shrugged. \"I\u2019m\u2026 winning you back.\u201d\n \u201cIn what universe is outing me to the entirety of Hogwarts and the rest of the wizarding world \u2018winning me?\u2019\u201d\nDraco asked, disbelief etched across his sharp features.\n Harry shifted uncomfortably. He walked over and sat down. \u201cThe article didn\u2019t say anything about you.\u201d\n \u201cNot today's,\u201d Draco shot back bitterly. \n\u201cAll I\u2019ve said is that I\u2019m taken. That I\u2019m, you know, in love with someone. Ron is the one who mentioned your name and I\u2019ll make sure he doesn\u2019t do it again. You can say whatever you want to the press.\u201d\n \u201cMy mother is ecstatic,\u201d Draco said. \nHarry blinked. \u201cShe\u2019s what?\u201d \n\u201cI got hers before the rest of the letters came,\u201d Draco admitted with a small sigh. He slid a folded piece of high-quality parchment over to Harry, who picked it up and opened it. \n\n\nMy love, \n\n\n\n\nWas this the reason you so strenuously refused to be Matched with Astoria last month? While I admit to feeling a certain amount of surprise over your choice of partner, I cannot fault your pick. Harry Potter is not only an uncommonly powerful young wizard with an impeccable bloodline on his father\u2019s side, but his reputation alone can only help to bring dignity and pride back to the Malfoy name.\n\n\n\n\n I have occasionally wondered about your preferences on the matter but when you refused to discuss it with me and allowed us to begin talks with the Greengrass family, I assumed that you approved of our plans. I only want the best for you, and of course Harry. Please know you can tell me anything.\n\n\n\n\n Please let me know, as well, if either of you need help dealing with the press when your relationship is fully exposed. I will contact our public relations firm, who I've no doubt will be speaking to us again after today. \n\n\n\n\nI would appreciate it if you would let me discuss the implications with your father as, surely, he is going to hear about this.\n\n\n\n\n I love you, \n\n\n\n\nMother\n\n\n Harry felt a weird bubble of laughter in his throat. \u201cYour father will hear about this? So, you\u2019re not the only one who says that?\u201d He paused. \u201cAnd when did you call off the idea to getting married to Astoria? I saw you talking to her\u2026\u201d \nDraco glared at him, meeting his eyes for the first time, but Harry felt a reluctant sense of amusement thread through the link. He reached out to place a gentle hand on Draco\u2019s back and, when he wasn\u2019t shrugged off, moved his palm in small circles. \n\u201cAlmost right after our Cores were disconnected. I couldn\u2019t\u2026 I couldn\u2019t. And she didn\u2019t want to, either. But don\u2019t you get it? Now you\u2019re a political ambition. It\u2019s all right for me to be gay, because you are, and because I\u2019m with you. And everyone will know. And we\u2019ll both be in danger because of it.\u201d Draco ran his fingers through his hair in agitation. \n\u201cSo?\u201d \nDraco groaned. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t that bother you? A normal person would be bothered.\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019ve been in danger for so many years, I think life is boring otherwise?\u201d Harry joked.\n \u201cHa bloody ha.\u201d Draco dropped his head down onto the desk with a thunk, exhaling loudly. Harry continued to pet him, fingers travelling up his spine to play with the hair at Draco's nape as he searched for the right words.\n \u201cAre you really ignoring the part about me being in love with you?\u201d he asked. \u201cI\u2019ve said it twice now.\u201d\n \u201cI really think they should add \u2018bullheaded\u2019 to the list of Gryffindor characteristics.\u201d\n \u201cThey don\u2019t need to; everyone knows. You\u2019re still ignoring it.\u201d \nDraco sighed. He lifted his head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d \nThe link flared to life in a way that it hadn\u2019t in so long and with it came the most piercing sort of sweetness that Harry had ever felt. He put a hand over his suddenly unsteady heart, his ribs growing too tight for his lungs. Love and fear in equal measure washed through him, and Harry's eyes ached, the urge to cry almost overwhelming as Draco watched him, face carefully blank.\n He leaned forward and pressed his lips against Draco\u2019s. The kiss was dry and chaste and perfect and Harry let it linger before pulling away. Draco looked down and bit his lower lip, worrying it between his teeth. \n\u201cSo are we together?\u201d Harry said. \n\u201cWell, I can\u2019t seem to get rid of you, can I?\u201d Draco complained.\n Harry snorted. \u201cThank Pansy for that. She told me to keep going until it was too inconvenient for you to ignore me.\u201d \n\u201cSo pretty much everyone knows about us?\u201d\n \u201cThe people that matter, I guess,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI don\u2019t mind being used as a political stepping stone, as long as it\u2019s not by you. I\u2019ve seen who you are; I know that you wouldn\u2019t. If it helps pave the way for your\u2026 mother, in particular, well\u2026\u201d Harry grimaced but shrugged. \u201cI can live with it. As for the danger aspect, has it not occurred to you what the link could do?\u201d\n Draco looked at him uncomprehendingly. \u201cI like my privacy, Harry. I like not being attached to you all of the time. I find the idea that you can read my thoughts distasteful.\u201d\n \u201cWell, I can\u2019t. Not unless you want me to, and even then it\u2019s not perfect. And it doesn\u2019t have to be open all the time. But just think: if something were to happen to one of us, we could let each other know we were in trouble through the link.\u201d Harry took a deep breath. \u201cIf that helps.\u201d \nThere was a long silence. Draco head jerked in a stilted nod. \u201cIt does. But you can\u2019t go in my head without my permission.\u201d\n \u201cMerlin, our Cores are separated now. I don\u2019t think I could even if I wanted to,\u201d Harry said. He pursed his lips, annoyed. \u201cNow, you tell me.\u201d \n\u201cWhat?\u201d Draco said loftily, gaze sliding away. \n\u201cTell me you love me, too,\u201d Harry demanded.\n Draco huffed. \u201cDo you always have to be so blunt about everything?\u201d\n \u201cTell me, Draco.\u201d\n \u201cI already did!\u201d \nHarry stilled and caught Draco\u2019s eyes with his own. \u201cPlease.\u201d\n \u201cFine, I love you,\u201d Draco muttered with bad grace. \u201cAre you happy, now?\u201d\n \u201cYes,\u201d Harry said. \u201cNow don\u2019t forget it.\u201d \nHarry stood cupped the back of Draco\u2019s neck, pulling him to his feet and kissing him firmly. For all of his verbal reticence, Draco responded immediately, eagerly, slanting his mouth against Harry\u2019s and opening it at the first touch of Harry\u2019s tongue. Harry slid his tongue inside, his first taste of Draco in too long like bright bursts of joy in his mind.\n Draco wound his arms around Harry\u2019s waist, pressing against him and Harry lost his breath at the firm line of him, at the hardness he could feel growing against his stomach. He pulled his mouth away, touching his forehead against Draco\u2019s. \u201cI missed you.\u201d \nDraco stared into his eyes and a fizzle of longing swept through the link. \n\u201cOf course you did, I\u2019m the best thing that ever happened to you,\u201d Draco said. Harry snickered. Draco\u2019s mouth curled down in a small, perplexed frown and his voice was soft as he continued, \u201cI missed you, too.\u201d\n Harry clutched him tighter and kissed him again, deepening it as a spark of arousal work its way through his body and his prick fattened. He thrust his hands into Draco\u2019s fine hair and walked him backwards to a desk so he could grind his hips lightly against him. \nDraco groaned. \u201cDon\u2019t you think we should go to one of our rooms?\u201d He gave Harry a crooked smile. \nHarry struggled to remove his wand from his too-tight trousers. He pointed it at the door and murmured, \"Colloportus\" under his breath. The lock snicked shut. \n\u201cI think we can stay here for a few more minutes,\u201d Harry said, voice husky. \nAnd they did.\nHarry woke up alone, groaning at the sunlight pouring in. He waved his wand frantically to shut the bed hangings and used all of his energy to nudge the link open, sending plaintive waves of hideousness through it.\nA hand shot through the curtains to offer him a fizzling potion. Harry took it gratefully, swallowing all of it in three gulps. He felt a sudden heave of nausea and another vicious throb in his head before the feeling subsided.\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Harry rasped out, relieved. \u201cIt\u2019s safe to come in, I\u2019m not going to sick up on you. Although you probably need to come to terms with seeing that if you\u2019re really going to go into Healer training next year.\u201d\n\u201cShut it.\u201d Draco peeked in carefully, then drew the curtains back open and sat down on the bed. \u201cServes you right, anyway for drinking too much.\u201d\n\u201cI had less than Ron!\u201d Harry said. Draco snorted.\n\u201cYes, and everyone at the party saw how that turned out. Asking Granger to marry him while falling over and nearly wetting himself. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s going over well this morning.\u201d Draco said, looking rather pleased with the thought.\n\u201cWhy are you out of bed?\u201d Harry asked. Draco was generally a deeper sleeper than he was, and since McGonagall had allowed them to re-room together back in the guest quarters, it was usually Harry who had to nag Draco out of bed.\nHe was still a little astonished that McGonagall had gone along with it. Harry had argued that neither of them would receive any privacy while sharing dorms \u2014 particularly after they had given a brief interview to the Quibbler about the bonding accident and their resultant relationship. People had started getting creative about sending mail through her wards, mostly because everyone knew Harry and Draco\u2019s Houses. It had taken a couple of weeks consideration but McGonagall had finally given in. Eyeing him narrowly, she'd agreed that it might be best if people outside Hogwarts didn\u2019t know where their living quarters. Draco claimed she\u2019d given in out of impressed admiration for Harry\u2019s sheer cheek at even asking.\nBut McGonagall, being McGonagall, had then instituted a new rule for every returning, of-age, eighth year, allowing them to move into rooms in the guest quarters if they so chose. It was a chance that most of the remaining eighth years had leapt at.\u00a0 So Harry and Draco's quiet refuge of the guest quarters had given way to two dozen other students, many coupled. This led to noise and more nosiness than Harry was generally okay with, as intrusions seemed to happen in their quarters frequently when he or Draco were about to be otherwise occupied.\nOn the plus side, it led to that much-lauded interhouse unity that McGonagall had gone on about during the beginning of the year. There was a party nearly weekend in someone's room, aided by plenty of elf-wine or Firewhiskey. People were getting along great. It may have had something to do with The Chosen One living with a Slytherin, Harry conceded to himself, but whatever worked.\nHarry stretched, nudging Draco\u2019s thigh with his foot as Draco perched on the side of the mattress. Draco\u2019s eyes had darkened, moving over him as the sheet slid down to expose more of Harry's body, and Harry felt a little smug. \n\"Sorry,\u201d Draco said, seeming to come back to himself. He addressed Harry\u2019s question. \u201cPacking. I\u2019m leaving in an hour.\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d Harry scowled a little. \u201cWhy are you packing? You\u2019ll only be gone for three days.\u201d\nHe and Draco had both stayed at Hogwarts for the better part of winter holidays, as had a lot of students. Harry had plans at the Burrow for Christmas Eve, which Draco had promised to join him for, and Christmas morning. Christmas dinner would be spent at Malfoy Manor with Draco and his mother, who had taken to telling every publication that asked how delighted she was that Harry had such fine taste in men, and how their relationship was a testament to Draco\u2019s character.\nHe wondered if they were going to have to have an awkward chat about the amount of interviews she\u2019d been giving, except\u2026 Well, everything she said was true.\n\u201cI have clothes there,\u201d Draco said. He gestured to a trunk that had been shrunk down for easy transport. \u201cMostly gifts for my mother.\u201d\n\u201cSpeaking of gifts\u2026\u201d Harry pulled his wand and Summoned a present that he\u2019d hidden in his own trunk. It was large and square and he'd wrapped in deep blue paper that twinkled with little stars. He shoved it into Draco\u2019s hands. \u201cYou might want to open that early.\u201d\nDraco looked down at it, a surprised little smile tilting his lips. He shrugged. \u201cIn that case\u2026\u201d\u00a0 He Summoned something from the drawer on his side of the bed and handed it to Harry.\nHarry stared down at the tiny red package. \u201cSo we just open?\u201d\n\u201cDo yours first.\u201d\nHarry grinned and tore open the paper, ignoring Draco\u2019s irritated huff as it fell to the floor. Underneath was a small black, lacquered box with a hinged lid.\nHe pried it up with stiff fingers and saw a long silver chain with a flat, round, gold and silver pendant nestled inside. Harry drew it out slowly, turning the disk in his hand. On one side, there was the engraving of a holly tree that came into full bloom when he touched it, filling with golden leaves and silver berries, before resetting.\nOn the other side, the tree was caught up in iridescent flames, the fire shimmering as it consumed and replenished the tree, much like a phoenix. Harry stared down at it so long that it grew warm in his hand.\nHe felt a trickle of anxiety through the link and looked up into worried grey eyes.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it\u2026\u201d Draco said hesitantly.\u00a0 Harry started laughing and Draco\u2019s worried look changed to offense.\n\u201cNo, no, I love it, I really do. It\u2019s perfect. It\u2019s so perfect.\u201d He looped the chain around his neck and felt the pendant settle in the middle of his chest. \u201cNow yours.\u201d\nDraco, unlike Harry, took his time opening the gift, gently sliding his fingers under the Spell-o-tape and unwinding the paper slowly. He stopped, staring at it with such all-encompassing shock that Harry reached over to peek at it and make sure that it still looked the same as it had before it was wrapped.\nThe painting depicted the small form of Draco standing at the edge of a pool, shaded with trees. He was looking down at the surface of the water, which rippled with different colors. The sky was a deep, intense blue and every so often, feathers would brush floated across the surface of the canvas, as if on a gust of wind.\n\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind,\u201d Harry said awkwardly when Draco stayed silent. \u201cI gave a Pensieve memory to the artist when I commissioned it, just a few seconds worth so he\u2019d know what I wanted it to look like. I had him add you in, after.\u201d\nDraco carefully placed the painting on the floor on its side. He turned to Harry, eyes glassy with unshed tears.\n\u201cYou got me something that shows me\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhere you keep your magic, yeah.\u201d Harry smiled crookedly. \u201cAnd you got me the same.\u201d\nDraco leaned in and kissed him, swift and hard. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a gift I\u2019ve ever gotten that I like more. Thank you.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Harry echoed, his voice a little hoarse. He cleared it. \u201cHave no idea how I\u2019m going to top it next year, though.\u201d\n\u201cNext year?\u201d Draco said with an elegantly wry arch of one eyebrow. Despite that, a wave of happiness flowed through the link to settle in Harry\u2019s chest, near where the pendant lay.\n\u201cNext year,\" he said firmly. \"I have more for this year but I guess we\u2019ll have to save that until we get back to Hogwarts,\u201d he added with a leer.\nDraco smirked. \u201cWe have a little time.\u201d\n\u201cDid you know,\u201d Harry said seriously, \u201cthat Dumbledore always told me that love was one of the strongest forms of magic?\u201d\nDraco\u2019s smirk became a full-fledged smile. \u201cStop bragging about your power, Harry, it\u2019s tacky.\u201d\nHarry snorted, disguising his pleasure at the backhanded compliment, and kissed him. Draco hummed with approval, pulling away to skim his teeth over the nerves under Harry\u2019s jawline, nuzzling his ear and making him shiver.\n\u201cHow much time do you have, really?\u201d\n\u201cEnough,\u201d Draco mumbled, pushing on Harry\u2019s shoulders. \u201cI want to try something.\u201d\nHarry went back against the pillows, heart pounding and cock twitching hard. He grinned breathlessly as Draco slithered down down his body.\nDraco lifted his knees so they were propped wide open. He lowered his head with a sly smile.\nAnd he kept going.\n\u00a0"
